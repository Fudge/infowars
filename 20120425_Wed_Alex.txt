[00:50.700 --> 00:53.940]  with his new executive order on the waterways you can't get Congress to sign
[00:53.940 --> 01:01.380]  a law of the sea treaty to hand over the oceans that the US controls to the UN so
[01:01.380 --> 01:09.220]  he just sets up an executive group and hands it over I knew all of this would
[01:09.220 --> 01:14.780]  happen I mean the rural council is headed up by the Pentagon and by Homeland

[09:29.300 --> 09:33.180]  about it they're waking up they're saying you're right I didn't have time
[09:33.180 --> 09:36.900]  getting ready to tell do I listen to San Antonio and Dallas radio I monitor it
[09:36.900 --> 09:45.060]  driving in every day the power of the drudge report is unbelievable I marvel
[09:45.060 --> 09:50.220]  at it drudge and we show folks drudge report calm went with the giant
[09:50.220 --> 09:57.780]  headline from the Daily Caller and it's now moved from being the top headline
[09:57.780 --> 10:04.260]  now says economic suicide pack his top headline was Obama administration to
[10:04.260 --> 10:12.420]  ban farm workers children working and doing chores on their own farm and that
[10:12.420 --> 10:19.140]  became the talking point even on a quasi-trendy liberal show that do was
[10:19.140 --> 10:24.780]  tuning into monitoring and had on the background here at the office and they
[10:24.780 --> 10:29.580]  were saying we're getting chills no no no I'm not just saying what Alex Jones
[10:29.580 --> 10:33.660]  says I'm getting chills because one of the guys grew up on a farm he's saying
[10:33.660 --> 10:39.540]  you your parents can't give you chores I've read this and I've worked on farms
[10:39.540 --> 10:45.420]  not just my family's farm and ranch but others okay that's where I come from and
[10:45.420 --> 10:53.580]  it says you cannot handle any of the raw materials of a farm eggs grain milk
[10:53.580 --> 11:04.020]  mowing grass the way this reads by the way it's not a law it's a rule a rule like
[11:04.020 --> 11:07.140]  Obama said hey Congress won't pass a law to shut down all these coal power
[11:07.140 --> 11:11.140]  plants that my buddies don't own he shuts them down there's make more money

[11:44.580 --> 11:51.620]  that's exactly what it's doing but it is heartening to know that every radio
[11:51.620 --> 11:56.780]  show I tuned into and that when I walked in here I was being told about it
[11:56.780 --> 12:03.460]  because the people are awake and the biggest internet media system in the
[12:03.460 --> 12:09.220]  world bigger than mainstream broadcast you name it is Drudge report calm no
[12:09.220 --> 12:13.420]  brag just fact I'm just telling you a fact and that's why they attack him and
[12:13.420 --> 12:18.700]  demonizing because they cannot stand the fact that they'll link to the daily
[12:18.700 --> 12:24.380]  caller that exposes the text of the rule they cannot stand that they'll link to
[12:24.380 --> 12:29.980]  info wars calm on a TSA story or during Bilderberg Drudge the last five years

[13:06.100 --> 13:10.100]  and more hardcore and has woken up more and more to what's happening and he has
[13:10.100 --> 13:17.380]  the courage to actually put out real information and to take info wars that
[13:17.380 --> 13:22.580]  was already on the map and growing exponentially and put on a map even more
[13:22.580 --> 13:28.300]  I mean every day now the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times or the

[17:05.180 --> 17:09.460]  in their corrupt image that the head of the Texas Banking Association came out

[24:09.220 --> 24:13.620]  pay billions of tax money to ship General Motors to China and Brazil
[24:13.620 --> 24:18.940]  and other countries why do they want to put taxes on us carbon taxes but not on
[24:18.940 --> 24:25.220]  other countries they want to bankrupt you they explain it in agenda 21 they
[24:25.220 --> 24:29.620]  want to wreck it so that you're dependent on them so they can rebuild it in
[24:29.620 --> 24:34.500]  their image they don't like you owning private property and being uppity
[24:34.500 --> 24:38.460]  Jim Tucker who's coming up in the next segment repeatedly says one of the top
[24:38.460 --> 24:44.620]  agendas is shutting down the economy not too fast because it'll make people
[24:44.620 --> 24:49.620]  rebel but as quickly as they can because they throw fits and they say how can we
[24:49.620 --> 24:55.020]  have 500 people out here protesting us in the middle of the Swiss Alps how do
[24:55.020 --> 24:59.700]  they have enough money to protest us and they actually say in meetings I want
[24:59.700 --> 25:07.900]  them bankrupt now that is the feudal lords instinct in every culture is to
[25:07.900 --> 25:11.740]  have the peasants a foot and a half shorter from generations of malnutrition
[25:11.740 --> 25:16.420]  snot running out of their noses digging around a tiny piece of property they're
[25:16.420 --> 25:22.180]  allowed to produce and most of it given to the king's men the king has dependent
[25:22.180 --> 25:27.380]  soldiers who then police the peasants who produce the food for them that's the
[25:27.380 --> 25:33.060]  government model that's how it works the club of Rome the UN Ted Turner Prince
[25:33.060 --> 25:39.300]  Philip Prince Bernhardt all of them say they want a post-industrial neo feudal
[25:39.300 --> 25:45.740]  system that's their word neo feudalism not mine I'm credited as coining neo
[25:45.740 --> 25:53.020]  feudalism I did not I coined neo fascistic feudalism or neo feudal
[25:53.020 --> 26:00.780]  fascism the point I coined propaganda placement years later they called it
[26:00.780 --> 26:06.260]  their own name behavior placement the brainwashing is what they call it
[26:06.260 --> 26:09.900]  sometimes they're just honest and say we got a brainwash the public I'm the
[26:09.900 --> 26:12.420]  attorney general I've been meeting with the media about brainwashing people
[26:12.420 --> 26:15.620]  we've got a brainwash when play the brainwash clip again you think I'm
[26:15.620 --> 26:19.820]  joking you're new I was listening again last night to these clips we've got
[26:19.820 --> 26:23.820]  where they're seeing mercury is good for kids leds good for kids China executes
[26:23.820 --> 26:26.860]  people for melamine in the milk here they just say hey your kids dying it's
[26:26.860 --> 26:32.420]  good for them again it's reach this cuckoo level but it's done on purpose to
[26:32.420 --> 26:40.420]  just overwhelm us and shock us until we can't even compute it anymore
[26:45.140 --> 26:48.940]  this is the main issue that we're discussing this is what we're talking
[26:48.940 --> 26:59.100]  about here is a bunch of crooks that real power isn't just having the biggest
[26:59.100 --> 27:08.500]  gun or the most powerful system of governance or houses or wealth it's
[27:08.500 --> 27:15.740]  no one is allowed to even survive or eat if you say they can't I'm gonna get
[27:15.740 --> 27:20.260]  into this more later after Jim Tucker leaves us and I am staggered by the
[27:20.260 --> 27:25.940]  information but rural kids parents angry about Labor Department rule banning
[27:25.940 --> 27:33.500]  farm chores and I went and read the subsections and sure enough it's right
[27:33.500 --> 27:41.180]  there it's a rural affairs rural counsel system under Department of Homeland
[27:41.180 --> 27:46.740]  Security and the Department of Defense and we've written articles about this in
[27:46.740 --> 27:50.740]  the past that they're going to come in harass the local farms jail time for any
[27:50.740 --> 27:56.380]  dust off your field no hay dust allowed you're gonna have to have chips on all
[27:56.380 --> 28:01.100]  your chickens and other farm animals big agra's exempt big agra is writing all
[28:01.100 --> 28:06.100]  this and they go to the EPA and the FDA and the Department of Agriculture and
[28:06.100 --> 28:11.860]  they just have them write rules and the bureaucrats are law making outside of
[28:11.860 --> 28:16.740]  law and telling Congress we'll do what we want even when Congress tells them
[28:16.740 --> 28:21.860]  not to it's totally illegal just like Congress says hey you can't launch a
[28:21.860 --> 28:25.620]  war without congressional approval you got to come to us and Obama said no I
[28:25.620 --> 28:30.340]  don't I got to you in the generals get before the senators the chairman of the

[28:39.060 --> 28:44.380]  Libya and they said no we don't come to you we go to the UN and the senator said
[28:44.380 --> 28:47.700]  excuse me that's that's unconstitutional that's illegal they and
[28:47.700 --> 28:51.220]  Panetta just said that's what it is Jack

[35:40.860 --> 35:47.420]  implement even if Congress won't ratify the banks are already going with it and

[37:11.620 --> 37:19.180]  not joking it that's a AP Fox News I mean just total bureaucratic hell this is
[37:19.180 --> 37:23.220]  the new economy the big mega corporations and banks want America
[37:23.220 --> 37:27.980]  shut down so we fully implode so they can buy it up get everybody on welfare
[37:27.980 --> 37:31.540]  everybody working for a mega corporation or government this is the new
[37:31.540 --> 37:36.700]  world order and this has always been their plan Jim Tucker author of the
[37:36.700 --> 37:41.420]  Bilderberg diary 36 years covering Bilderberg forcing it out in the news I
[37:41.420 --> 37:46.100]  wanted to get you on about the Washington Post last week who as you've pointed
[37:46.100 --> 37:50.220]  out always attends every year and never reports on it admitting Bilderberg's real
[37:50.220 --> 37:56.140]  and admitting that they basically vet vice presidents like a rubio incredible
[37:56.140 --> 38:01.860]  on that front but of course the big news sir info wars.com and this is what
[38:01.860 --> 38:06.060]  intel sources like Gosling who's been accurate in the past are saying they
[38:06.060 --> 38:13.220]  have shut it down for the three days in May 31st to the 3rd so four days of
[38:13.220 --> 38:18.700]  June the Chantilly Virginia where you and I were there where Obama was knighted
[38:18.700 --> 38:22.580]  supreme leader and Hillary stepped down and the media wouldn't cover it we were
[38:22.580 --> 38:28.260]  there secret of Bilderberg group set to meet in Virginia May 31st June 3rd Jim
[38:28.260 --> 38:34.860]  Tucker of American Free Press net joins us and to tell us if his intel can
[38:34.860 --> 38:39.860]  either confirm or deny this situation let's cover that first Jim you're there
[38:39.860 --> 38:45.380]  in Virginia you're there in DC or close by you worked there at the paper that's
[38:45.380 --> 38:53.820]  in DC what is your intel Jim Tucker? I am 99% sure that the meeting will be as you
[38:53.820 --> 38:59.620]  said May 31 June 3 at the Westfields barriott where they met just three years
[38:59.620 --> 39:11.260]  ago Tony Gosling and others who tried to make a reservation for just one person
[39:11.260 --> 39:16.900]  just one and he said he's you know he understood that from his telephone
[39:16.900 --> 39:22.900]  call of course and he'd like to visit Washington and stay at the Westfields
[39:22.900 --> 39:29.020]  on any weekend in May or June but he has trouble getting reservations for one and
[39:29.020 --> 39:37.180]  their answer was they're all filled up May 31 to June 3rd they can even take one
[39:37.180 --> 39:44.260]  more reservation for that at those dates but they but every other weekend is
[39:44.260 --> 39:49.700]  okay that and other information coming together makes me 99% sure the reason I
[39:49.700 --> 39:56.740]  say 99 is because we've been unable to get our certain congressman who had been
[39:56.740 --> 40:05.140]  friendly before and would find out for us to confirm it to confirm 100% but
[40:05.140 --> 40:11.740]  it's time for our colleagues in Europe and the 200 from the United States
[40:11.740 --> 40:19.780]  individual independent newspapers independent broadcast outlets to grab
[40:19.780 --> 40:26.260]  their other parts a pair of socks and heads of Chantilly calls 99% odds are very
[40:26.260 --> 40:32.420]  heavy odds and I'll be very surprised if we don't find them at Chantilly so let's
[40:32.420 --> 40:37.500]  get back to start moving well Jim didn't they meet almost four years ago it'll be
[40:37.500 --> 40:42.740]  four years this June on the campaign trail there Hillary and Obama disappeared
[40:42.740 --> 40:46.620]  for a day we saw the Secret Service the motorcades we knew they were there your
[40:46.620 --> 40:50.300]  sources confirmed it but the media wouldn't cover it that shows how
[40:50.300 --> 40:53.780]  controlled they are and I want to get into that in a moment but didn't they
[40:53.780 --> 41:00.220]  meet there in 2002 and then again in 2008 so they've met at that that hotel
[41:00.220 --> 41:07.580]  twice haven't they I think I had to pull out my book and double check on it but
[41:07.580 --> 41:16.700]  they definitely met there I think it was after Obama was president elect and after
[41:16.700 --> 41:26.300]  the election but before before the square again yes no it was sure it was
[41:26.300 --> 41:29.100]  right before that it was whenever Hillary stepped down she stepped down
[41:29.100 --> 41:33.820]  there at Bilderberg I see her right but Jim going back here because I believe
[41:33.820 --> 41:37.820]  they were also there a few years before that they do come here every four years
[41:37.820 --> 41:42.420]  it's generally in Virginia it's close to the airport there you and I of course
[41:42.420 --> 41:47.500]  were there four years ago before years ago this this June I will be there but
[41:47.500 --> 41:51.060]  aren't we learning of its location a little bit earlier this year than we
[41:51.060 --> 41:53.340]  normally do
[41:53.340 --> 42:05.700]  it's run the deal there's time so I found out in January and February for it when they're going to be there's one notable vacation for
[42:05.700 --> 42:11.420]  we're desperate to not find them and I got a call from the American Free Press
[42:11.420 --> 42:15.660]  saying grab your other pair of socks get packed your own you're flying to France
[42:15.660 --> 42:21.500]  today they'd already made the flights for me and all that stuff they just found
[42:21.500 --> 42:25.940]  out just in time they've got that close what so it's been all variations in
[42:25.940 --> 42:33.940]  between and then all sources start to die and then we have to find new sources so
[42:33.940 --> 42:41.580]  that complicates the whole issue too but 99% are very good odds so we better get
[42:41.580 --> 42:48.380]  there and I was interested in your comments about the big farmers and
[42:48.380 --> 42:53.260]  taking over and you're absolutely correct that's why Archer Daniels Midland
[42:53.260 --> 42:58.460]  has had executives at his Bilderberg meetings for years and years and years
[42:58.460 --> 43:07.820]  and that it does fit their program to equalize the economies of the world
[43:07.820 --> 43:14.460]  the developed nations that they call prosperous nations should for money it
[43:14.460 --> 43:20.180]  under underveloped nations and they call toward nations all these euthanisms and
[43:20.180 --> 43:25.460]  our standard living should go down the third world standard living should go up
[43:25.460 --> 43:33.140]  until we're all equally on a median standard of living throughout the world
[43:33.140 --> 43:38.980]  that's their goal they really mean is pour our tax money into their companies
[43:38.980 --> 43:43.180]  in the third world and actually use it to enslave those people the cover is they
[43:43.180 --> 43:47.780]  want to raise them up and lower us but as the Copenhagen document showed two and
[43:47.780 --> 43:52.420]  a half years ago it was actually right at double the carbon taxes on the third
[43:52.420 --> 43:56.220]  world that it would be on the West so they use that as their cover but it's
[43:56.220 --> 44:01.780]  far more diabolical what do you make of 20 plus billion to General Motors to move
[44:01.780 --> 44:06.780]  the Cadillac and vault plants to China that's now been announced
[44:06.780 --> 44:13.780]  I don't think I could express myself in a way that would suit the license body
[44:13.780 --> 44:18.980]  I'll just say I'm outraged unbelievable treason sir what do you make of the
[44:18.980 --> 44:23.420]  Washington Post last week coming out I mean the significance of this you've
[44:23.420 --> 44:28.780]  always pointed out that they run defense and offense for Bilderberg being the
[44:28.780 --> 44:32.700]  chosen media for 60 years to be at Bilderberg to have them come out and go
[44:32.700 --> 44:37.140]  yeah Bilderberg pretty much picks vice presidents and presidents yeah Rubio's
[44:37.140 --> 44:41.740]  going down to a Columbia so he can up his cred for the Bilderberg meeting
[44:41.740 --> 44:47.660]  coming up for VP with Romney I mean that is amazing what does that signify I'm
[44:47.660 --> 44:53.460]  gonna find out tomorrow the reason I say this my home is actually 70 miles out in
[44:53.460 --> 44:58.140]  Orange County Virginia from Washington and I work mostly for my home emailing
[44:58.140 --> 45:05.660]  that kind of jazz I'm in Arlington today because of the speech I have to make
[45:05.660 --> 45:14.780]  an interest tomorrow but I have to fly to Memphis tomorrow but I get what they
[45:14.780 --> 45:20.940]  call their bulldog edition printed early this is another old trick of theirs to
[45:20.940 --> 45:26.700]  grab a little story in for the very last edition so they say we did too cover it
[45:26.700 --> 45:32.500]  but here's a clipping we did we did to mention Bilderberg so I'll go down the
[45:32.500 --> 45:39.260]  press club tomorrow for in addition to a bar they also they really truly have a
[45:39.260 --> 45:44.420]  library press club it has some magic they can play because I can always say I
[45:44.420 --> 45:50.220]  won't the biggest search of possible pretty used every use the term
[45:50.220 --> 45:55.940]  trilateral Commission or Bilderberg say from April 1st until the until the
[45:55.940 --> 46:02.620]  present moment and they've got this big job is both but this week the biggest
[46:02.620 --> 46:09.260]  daily the periodicals the broadcast all that stuff no I understand that you're
[46:09.260 --> 46:12.620]  not an internet guy so you haven't read the full Washington Post yet let me give
[46:12.620 --> 46:17.380]  it to you it's last week it's Al Cayman I got fitting name a little crocodile the
[46:17.380 --> 46:22.300]  new world order and it says in the loop shout at a dictator get some VP cred
[46:22.300 --> 46:27.740]  and then it goes on in the article to say yeah Bilderberg picks presidents and
[46:27.740 --> 46:32.020]  VPs and looks like a Rubio you know he's the only senator going down to the
[46:32.020 --> 46:34.860]  meeting that though and he says the little bird told him it's for Bilderberg
[46:34.860 --> 46:39.100]  to try to up his cred so that's right there in the article you can scroll down
[46:39.100 --> 46:43.620]  and read it so again a guy scroll back up to the top so I can give Jim the date
[46:43.620 --> 46:47.620]  thank you and we're showing this to prison planet TV viewers just just
[46:47.620 --> 46:51.380]  shrink it down guys you can just give me the date thank you I'll give you the
[46:51.380 --> 46:55.340]  date here in just a second yeah okay or guys just print for me on April 11th
[46:55.340 --> 47:00.740]  April 11th April 11 okay I'll read that tomorrow but I get to the press club
[47:00.740 --> 47:05.900]  I'll make sure that one I would have gotten it anyway but I'll make sure I
[47:05.900 --> 47:10.500]  get it I mean what do you make of that though I mean I just read it to you
[47:10.500 --> 47:15.220]  why would they go from saying it didn't exist and you were insane and New York
[47:15.220 --> 47:18.220]  Times said it didn't exist and that we were there four years ago the New York
[47:18.220 --> 47:23.540]  Times said I was there at Chantilly with you literally hallucinating in a park
[47:23.540 --> 47:28.660]  and that there was no helicopters marines and playing clubs sacred service
[47:28.660 --> 47:32.620]  machine guns we've got it all on tape you know foreign leaders with with their
[47:32.620 --> 47:37.980]  national anthem being played it didn't exist Jim but we just had a mirage yeah
[47:37.980 --> 47:41.020]  yeah we're we're insane
[47:41.020 --> 47:47.860]  but down the post can forever say we did to write a report on Billerburg oh they've
[47:47.860 --> 47:52.260]  done that on a number of other stories they don't like over the years I think
[47:52.260 --> 47:56.860]  something in the very last edition and maybe not even the whole last edition
[47:56.860 --> 48:03.060]  of they call chasing it and but look at the condescension saying it doesn't
[48:03.060 --> 48:06.460]  exist while the editor tell folks about the Washington Post the connection of
[48:06.460 --> 48:12.780]  Billerburg well the Washington Post was involved in the establishing
[48:12.780 --> 48:21.380]  Billerburg in 1954 now these bankers and international financiers and politicians
[48:21.380 --> 48:29.140]  had been meeting for four centuries but didn't they decide we've got to meet
[48:29.140 --> 48:35.780]  regularly every year and on a regular basis regular time and so they possibly
[48:35.780 --> 48:39.820]  call themselves Billerburg culture that means being for they decided that was
[48:39.820 --> 48:46.220]  held at the Billerburg hotel of hotel called Billerburg hotel and this
[48:46.220 --> 48:54.500]  directs Switzerland so since then they've now old old man grand the original
[48:54.500 --> 49:01.140]  Phillip Graham was at that meeting he shot himself in his bathtub of a few
[49:01.140 --> 49:06.460]  years later and then Mrs. Graham came out of the kitchen literally as a housewife
[49:06.460 --> 49:14.860]  and became publisher well they have such a big staff they did then anybody's
[49:14.860 --> 49:18.260]  little sister could be publisher because she had a big head the executive staff
[49:18.260 --> 49:22.940]  that can actually run the newspaper so she attended and she started taking her
[49:22.940 --> 49:28.060]  little boy Donald Graham with her and then she decided to die and Donald Graham
[49:28.060 --> 49:34.740]  has attended every meeting since then never misses a meeting but never
[49:34.740 --> 49:39.980]  reports on it either we've identified him for the graph at every meeting they've
[49:39.980 --> 49:47.020]  had well I'm gonna say this I'm coming up there in my Info Wars bus and I want

[54:47.020 --> 54:51.060]  try to get us to commit acts of violence we're planning to peacefully cover the
[54:51.060 --> 54:56.340]  event and destroy the Bilderberg group with info weapons the pen is mightier

[55:00.500 --> 55:05.580]  usurped I want farm kids to be able to do chores with their parents because
[55:05.580 --> 55:08.220]  they're saying they want to ban chores in the house and have kids go to the
[55:08.220 --> 55:11.740]  state and divorce the parents this is the end of parental rights I'm sorry I'm
[55:11.740 --> 55:17.180]  ranting Jim you grew up on a cotton farm didn't you yes I'm a certified
[55:17.180 --> 55:28.060]  redneck okay sorry he bit cotton with your hands and but my now it is so
[55:28.060 --> 55:33.300]  important to Obama not have another four years of inhibited because you'll not
[55:33.300 --> 55:40.300]  have to run again to ruin this country the boy is a self-avowed communist he
[55:40.300 --> 55:45.620]  called himself a communist 40 years old that he announced the state Senate he
[55:45.620 --> 55:52.660]  had these footballs who had been actually killing people in burning down
[55:52.660 --> 55:57.620]  cities they called themselves communist in Washington they shot and killed a
[55:57.620 --> 56:01.900]  few people during the rise it's worse than that it's in the New York Times he
[56:01.900 --> 56:06.540]  says I can't wait to get reelected that's the headline I'm gonna be a
[56:06.540 --> 56:11.300]  dictator and use executive orders and bypass Congress he said I'm gonna I
[56:11.300 --> 56:15.540]  can't wait to get reelected and quote bypass Congress I mean it's really
[56:15.540 --> 56:20.740]  happening Jim yes and this country's gonna be a very bad shape of that
[56:20.740 --> 56:27.060]  self-avowed communist he's not calling himself a communist for under political
[56:27.060 --> 56:34.180]  pressures bad bad politics but he was in his 40s when they were still gathered
[56:34.180 --> 56:40.580]  around him and he tried to deport some of them to the government positions and
[56:40.580 --> 56:45.420]  then the adults around him although left-wing democracy you don't dare do
[56:45.420 --> 56:51.060]  that but again the mega bankers want communism to suck out our wealth they're
[56:51.060 --> 56:55.700]  exempt from the taxes like GE they transferred overseas that's the new
[56:55.700 --> 57:00.420]  order plan Jim we've only got two minutes left any new intel on Builderburg this
[57:00.420 --> 57:05.860]  year and what's on their agenda well heavily of course the economic crisis
[57:05.860 --> 57:10.620]  and they're gonna have problems with Britain now we can always say great
[57:10.620 --> 57:21.700]  things about Britain but in this case the starting with Lady Thatcher they
[57:21.700 --> 57:27.640]  refuse to give up the pound in favor of the year of
[57:27.640 --> 57:39.940]  calls this lady thatcher said she attended one meeting back when she was prime minister and she was refused she had nothing to say and they never
[57:39.940 --> 57:45.060]  invited her back and then they got a trapeze artist from her own party around
[57:45.060 --> 57:53.020]  against her and defeat defeat her for the job of prime minister they're they're
[57:53.020 --> 57:58.180]  that powerful but I had the pleasure of talking to her informally at a cocktail
[57:58.180 --> 58:04.020]  party test club about a year later and I asked her reaction to being denounced by
[58:04.020 --> 58:08.500]  Builderburg and she said she used the word tribute this is a rough paraphrase but
[58:08.500 --> 58:15.580]  she's a tribute to being denounced by Builderburg any organization that was
[58:15.580 --> 58:22.500]  take away one ounce of sovereignty we are all far allies we're part of NATO and

[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:32.500]  banks are gonna run America and you are gonna pay carbon taxes you know what
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:36.020]  family farms are gonna get inspected and we're gonna shut you down for no
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:39.380]  reason and I'll let your kids do chores and you know what we're gonna give your
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:46.780]  kids shots and take their DNA without parental consent without warrants I mean
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:53.180]  just everywhere it goes on and on and on and you know I see these articles this
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:57.780]  is out of MSNBC they're very excited Obama can't hardly wait is the headline
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:10:02.180]  the New York Times examines how Obama is using his executive powers as he faces
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:06.860]  the Congress blocking many of his initiatives oh and it just goes on to
[01:10:06.860 --> 01:10:11.780]  say that he can't wait till he gets reelected and has the quotes here so he
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:18.700]  can do whatever he wants what do you call that when you do whatever you want
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:26.740]  the law the Constitution says you go to Congress to launch a war Obama says not
[01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:31.260]  only will I launch a war which is what Julius Caesar did it's what Hitler did
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:36.100]  it's what dictators do but I'm gonna do it under the UN command it's even
[01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:45.140]  beyond having a dictator it's a foreign puppet dictator a viceroy an imperial
[01:10:45.140 --> 01:10:55.300]  legate a total power puppet and again the fact that they're starting to hide
[01:10:55.300 --> 01:10:57.940]  all this in plain view means they're getting ready to do it all I mean look
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:03.380]  what they're already doing I mean it is Mayday now I've always said oh a few
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:08.420]  more years are building it up no I guess we're here and and I mean let me tell you
[01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:13.260]  to launch all this they're gonna have to have some false flags and and they're
[01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:17.380]  gonna be bad they're gonna kill a lot of people and it's gonna be hard to see the
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:20.940]  killers the people that did this who even write memos about how a terror
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:24.660]  attack will make them look like heroes that's how dumb they think we are with
[01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:29.700]  the establishment whore media up there going along with the official story and
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:34.300]  shutting down websites like info wars comm and you better believe drudge
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:38.820]  report comm and others when they pull the trigger the only way to beat this is
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:43.220]  to admit we have a criminal foreign banker run government everybody who
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:47.980]  said I was wrong now admit I was right that I wasn't radical I'd studied
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:52.500]  history I was correct and you're gonna have to quote get radical you meet
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:57.260]  radical globalist eugenicist powergrabbers who are involved in a
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:12:02.620]  corporate police state internal coup d'etat against the country by being
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:07.940]  radical it's not radical the system tells you it's radical to be into guns
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:12.300]  that's just America they tell you it's radical to be pro-family or it's radical
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:14.700]  for the man to be the head of the household when that's what makes women
[01:12:14.700 --> 01:12:21.180]  happy to begin with all the studies show they tell you that normalcy is radical
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:26.780]  raw milk is radical mothers milk is radical and bad they were dirty but
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:30.940]  some high fructose corn syrup poison full of mercury and lead is good for your
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:37.620]  baby mercury lead good mothers milk bad mom apple pie blessings beauty health
[01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:42.460]  everything good bad everything disease torture lying black uniforms
[01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:50.620]  humiliation taxes bureaucracy good and now I mean I got up this morning and it
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:54.340]  was on info wars.com I saw an article one of our writers did about Obama says
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:13:00.340]  he can't wait to ignore Congress and I'm like oh did somebody go too far because
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:03.660]  as a you know head editor of everything sometimes stuffs everyone's well is
[01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:08.500]  exaggerated generally though it's worse than what my writers say generally I'm
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:12.580]  like listen this is a lot worse than what you said okay I understand it's hard
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:16.860]  to write how bad it is because it's so incredible we've got natural gauges in
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:22.020]  this to not want to believe this but it's worse than what you wrote here we
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:26.460]  please add this but I thought this just can't be and I went and read all these
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.020]  White House advisors and pundits and the president going oh just don't worry
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:34.860]  all those quotes of Obama about I can't wait you know it'd be great if I was a
[01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:40.180]  dictator similar stuff to Bush just so long as I'm the dictator and to crowds
[01:13:40.180 --> 01:13:43.420]  you know Congress is holding me back but I don't have the right to do what I
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:49.820]  want I wish I could help you it's their fault Congress by the way is giving him
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:52.700]  almost everything he wants and when they don't give him carbon taxes it'll
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:56.780]  openly shut America down he just doesn't himself or when they say hey we want to
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:14:00.980]  launch a war in Libby and put al Qaeda in charge we're warmongers like you but
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:06.100]  will you just come to us to get authorization and he's like no they're
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:11.020]  like well why because I said so the UNC they just don't like not being at the
[01:14:11.020 --> 01:14:14.820]  table and now he's just saying look you don't even count don't the feds say the
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:22.260]  states don't count oh there's no states rights you know why we have states so I
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:31.660]  saw the article and I couldn't believe it and it it blew me away and then I went
[01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:35.980]  and read all the quotes and it's in the New York Times Wall Street Journal MSNBC
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:43.380]  is very very excited about it and just thinks that it's absolutely incredible
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:49.260]  go ready for yourself so there they are yeah we want a dictatorship under any
[01:14:49.260 --> 01:14:53.260]  other name is still a dictatorship arose is still arose on the other name and
[01:14:53.260 --> 01:15:05.900]  yeah there's a map 21 system under agenda 21 bill that says the IRS can just say
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.300]  you don't have a second minute right anymore if they feel like it for any
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:12.500]  reason you just put on a no-gun buy list no gun on list which we know the
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.820]  White House chief of staff run the manual said in speeches they would do
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:21.660]  how many times I played that clip and then they also say in there you won't be
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:25.500]  able to travel unless the IRS authorizes you no judge no jury and I found a
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:29.060]  bunch of other stuff in there and of course they're gonna have the IRS has
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:32.780]  got their fingers in every business all this compliance stuff that's indentured
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:36.900]  servitude making you work for them hundreds of billions a year hundreds of
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:41.540]  billions conservatively last time was 250 something billion they were
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:50.980]  estimating for IRS compliance and now you're gonna comply on all this other
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.980]  stuff and the IRS who works for the private Federal Reserve that's the
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:59.620]  bankers army backed up by your local federalized SWAT team and your federalized
[01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:05.060]  state police and then your homeland security I knew it would happen the TSA
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:09.780]  is now reports are coming in at shopping malls and groping people just randomly
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:18.660]  go where the TSA and they wave a magic little wand and your police suddenly can
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:22.700]  do it so the Supreme Court says yeah police even a custodial arrest saw the
[01:16:22.700 --> 01:16:27.340]  road to now strip search it and they're now hiring people who want to do it
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:33.260]  that's the thing is that every weirdo pervert is now getting a badge and a gun
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:40.420]  and they can't even pass those requirements they just become TSA I
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:45.540]  mean we've got cancer the federal government is foreign banker run enemy
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:48.580]  beachhead and they're getting ready to roll up the whole country and the
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:54.540]  American people finally woke up there by five million guns a month but the
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:57.660]  civil war route is not the way to go because they're gonna blow stuff up and
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:00.740]  blame it on those of us that defend ourselves and in the end we'll end up
[01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:03.820]  winning that physical battle but the globalist will sit offshore they don't
[01:17:03.820 --> 01:17:06.700]  care everything gets wrecked they'll come back in later under another
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:12.340]  incarnation because what they want to do is wreck the society so Obama says he
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.380]  can't wait to get reelected by the way when Mitt Romney gets in if he does he'll
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.660]  just use all the new powers to he's bought and paid for by the exact same
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:23.580]  people you think Bush is bad so you're like oh Obama must be better and then
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:30.540]  he's horrible will Romney must be better no no just watch but the way they're
[01:17:30.540 --> 01:17:35.140]  looking they may just put Obama in regardless and declare a member and if
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:40.540]  you're not it for it you're racist so they're now announcing you cannot help
[01:17:40.540 --> 01:17:46.060]  with any family chores no no judge no jury no law it's a rule from the
[01:17:46.060 --> 01:17:51.060]  Department of Labor and Agriculture oh here's another one water in your bird
[01:17:51.060 --> 01:17:55.180]  bath New York Times that will be $300 no water ever allowed in bird baths
[01:17:55.180 --> 01:18:00.340]  because you don't know when to dump it out to kill mosquitoes so now anything
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:03.100]  that holds water you're gonna be fined and the bureaucrats are coming on your
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:06.580]  property without warrants they're now teaching bureaucrat code enforcers and
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:11.300]  others that they don't have to have a warrant and teaching you it's a privilege
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:14.700]  why not they told you driving is a privilege it's not they're not telling
[01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:19.300]  you guns are a privilege and it goes on and on but then the big kahuna today
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:23.700]  that's that's that this story is getting no traction and angers me we need to get
[01:18:23.700 --> 01:18:28.980]  this out to everybody bill allows IRS to revoke second amendment rights by
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:34.100]  stealth and here's the the issue just like with the NDA oh Alex it doesn't
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:38.700]  allow secret arrest of citizens months later after it passes oh yeah it does
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:42.780]  head of the FBI says yeah it does but you know gotta ask the president about
[01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:47.620]  that she wants us in place oh yeah it does do that I've read the bill you can
[01:18:47.620 --> 01:18:51.140]  read it it ties into this whole administrative thing it ties into what
[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:55.180]  the chief why does he have a staff a manual now the Chicago mob boss said
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:59.500]  that they would just put you on a list through the agencies and you don't own
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:04.860]  guns never convicted no crime total tyranny and we've got the subsection
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:11.180]  that says it but it's not just knives they say any permit any right any they
[01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:16.020]  can withdraw anything they can say you can't travel take your house without
[01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:19.700]  judges juries anything I mean it's more than just guns we just focused on that
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:25.500]  just total massive lawless a declaration that yes we're criminals yes we're

[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:18.140]  question I've been listening to you for a long time since you don't like us and
[01:27:18.140 --> 01:27:22.900]  I was just gonna give memory if you remember a guy calling in you were
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:28.860]  talking about President Bush senior at the time and I called in told you I
[01:27:28.860 --> 01:27:33.780]  thought he was the devil I was just wondering if you remember that I think
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:38.340]  I vaguely do remember that yes sir and I was wondering if you know what I'm
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:45.460]  talking about now I didn't mean that he was the devil I mean that he's working
[01:27:45.460 --> 01:27:49.860]  for the devil oh they are 100 it's all real let me tell you that these people
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:53.780]  believe they they think Lucifer's God they follow it that's why they're so
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:58.900]  horrible I mean I was watching a movie about a reported true story of
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:04.100]  extra systems on the treadmill today it's called the right with Anthony
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:10.460]  Hopkins actually a chance to meet one time but side issue and it's a you know
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:14.940]  true story or based on what what reporters said they saw and the point is
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:19.340]  in all these cultures what demons act like and what they like to do is what
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:25.420]  these government leaders do I mean that's what it's like I mean I can't I
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:29.620]  watch legend that I hadn't seen since I was a teenager with Tom Cruise a few
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:33.100]  weeks ago on the treadmill and the little demons that are going out little
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:36.100]  goblins going out to kill the unicorn the kind of little things they say and
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:40.180]  what they do and how they like ugliness and hurting good things and it's like I
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:44.300]  can't watch stuff like that because I'm like this isn't movies all these all
[01:28:44.300 --> 01:28:48.500]  this stuff comes from what's really gone on but it's it's all metaphors these
[01:28:48.500 --> 01:28:54.140]  people are goblins these people are like oh so cute and sweet like to see it
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:29:01.460]  rotting meat you know it's that's who they are and I can it's just like oh man
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:07.340]  I mean look at what these governments do the horrors it's it they're waging they
[01:29:07.340 --> 01:29:12.260]  are these these people are the legions of Satan and they have taken over the

[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:47.060]  calls David finish your point yes I get what you say now about he reminds you
[01:33:47.060 --> 01:33:53.180]  of the devil that these people are the devil go ahead get your opinion if you
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:58.340]  think we're watching revelations live my my opinion is studying revelations in
[01:33:58.340 --> 01:34:04.100]  the Bible I believe that Obama is more than just a prophet I think he may be
[01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:09.500]  your false prophet setting up a new role order for the anti-Christ I don't know
[01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:13.300]  the world's so crazy I mean who knows I mean it might as well be but I say go
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:17.540]  ahead and get it over with but you know here's my issue growing up all I heard
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:24.180]  was preachers say you know Jesus comes back in 1987-89 all this stuff
[01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:28.060]  constantly is put out there so that people always say well I'm not gonna do
[01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:33.020]  anything it's the end of the world or the New Ages think 2012 is the end of
[01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:36.620]  the world so they're all sucking their thumbs when you're supposed to be out
[01:34:36.620 --> 01:34:40.540]  there confronting the evil now people in Nazi Germany thought it was the end of
[01:34:40.540 --> 01:34:43.660]  the world thought Hitler was the anti-Christ of course there are many
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:47.860]  anti-Christ and the Bible say that so this is definitely a model of it and
[01:34:47.860 --> 01:34:52.780]  more and more it's lining up but it's gonna get a lot worse where you want to
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:55.580]  go to school want a job you got to put a port in your head where they can plug
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:59.380]  in they're already saying that so it's gonna get a lot worse there's a lot
[01:34:59.380 --> 01:35:04.540]  more to come to the point of if God didn't intervene there would be no flesh
[01:35:04.540 --> 01:35:11.900]  left un un unharmed or or no flesh left on earth see see the globalist are
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:15.620]  pure deception whether you believe in the devil or not you know what that
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:19.860]  archetype there yet so the devil's real it's called the New World Order whether
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:24.620]  you believe in the devil of the Bible or not the devil's real folks it might as
[01:35:24.620 --> 01:35:28.220]  well be these people make the devil look like a you know a sweetie cake I
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:33.460]  mean you know true evil is so much beyond what a good person didn't mean
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:37.020]  we're perfect but our hearts good we have a blind spot because we can't even
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:42.820]  imagine it we can't imagine a serial killer wants to grab a sweet your sweet
[01:35:42.820 --> 01:35:47.420]  little three-year-old girl rape him and torture him for months and just sucking
[01:35:47.420 --> 01:35:52.700]  off of the horror and the pain and for us that's like just just disgusting and
[01:35:52.700 --> 01:35:58.340]  raging and painful to them it's like sunshine it's black sunshine that's
[01:35:58.340 --> 01:36:02.780]  what psychopaths describe it as like a glowing darkness and and and and they
[01:36:02.780 --> 01:36:07.380]  must be defeated they must be they must be overrun they must learn fear they
[01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:12.220]  must be trampled and so any church that doesn't tell you to go out and engage
[01:36:12.220 --> 01:36:16.140]  corruption and it doesn't have the discernment to know and tells you do
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:19.180]  what the government says well that means the devil will come and they'll do
[01:36:19.180 --> 01:36:23.460]  what the government says any church doing that of course is a
[01:36:23.460 --> 01:36:27.340]  domination run by the Rockefeller Foundation through the World Council of
[01:36:27.340 --> 01:36:32.980]  Churches and you might as well go join a Satan Church literally because they are
[01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:41.500]  they are demon-filled disgusting pharaceutical pieces of Romans 13
[01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:47.620]  death-loving trash I appreciate your call I mean that's what I have to say
[01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:52.060]  about these churches is that you can have people that believe in God you can
[01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:55.700]  have people that are there that are good but it's always about worshiping the
[01:36:55.700 --> 01:36:59.660]  government if Romans 13 and the context they teach it was true then Hitler
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:04.500]  should have been followed and supported Stalin should have been loved our
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:10.820]  founding fathers were bad it's a lie Christ said no to the government every
[01:37:10.820 --> 01:37:14.940]  one of the prophets said no the lion's den the list goes on and on and these
[01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:24.220]  the abomination churches are devils they are devils little soft puppets that
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:29.780]  want to keep their 501c3 that they shouldn't even have churches don't
[01:37:29.780 --> 01:37:34.540]  need a 501c3 I know those little devils are listening right now and they're
[01:37:34.540 --> 01:37:38.700]  like well how come we have them because they came to the churches through the
[01:37:38.700 --> 01:37:42.660]  Rockefeller Foundation and said here's your form for your tax exemption and
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:47.260]  trick them into becoming a charity a charity is under government regulations
[01:37:47.260 --> 01:37:52.820]  not a church not a church they play word games they deceived you they stole
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:58.500]  your birthright and we wouldn't be in this position if the churches weren't
[01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:07.540]  filled to the rafters if there weren't demons dancing around the steeples
[01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:15.260]  let's go ahead and talk to Bob and main Bob you're on the air what's going on
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:20.300]  I was calling from deep in the heart of FEMA region one you are there yes hey
[01:38:20.300 --> 01:38:25.060]  just wanted to let you know I was doing the internet also you guys should put
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:27.980]  something on your website about shortwave I don't catch your shoulder in
[01:38:27.980 --> 01:38:32.920]  the day I catch you on shortwave and I also want to let you know that the
[01:38:32.920 --> 01:38:38.140]  hams I'm also a ham radio operator we're working on we got networks going
[01:38:38.140 --> 01:38:42.420]  digital networks we get together and we pass information back and forth the
[01:38:42.420 --> 01:38:46.660]  news story so when the internet does get shut down we'll have a way to
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:50.500]  communicate what I do is sometimes for practice I'll take some of your news
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:55.460]  stories and we're circulating them on ham radio so your stories are getting
[01:38:55.460 --> 01:38:58.980]  out I need to do more promoting our powerful shortwave frequencies is just
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:01.900]  they're changing a few times a year and I can't keep track of it I can't keep
[01:39:01.900 --> 01:39:06.220]  track of my checkbook buddy I mean I'm just I have to make myself take time out
[01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:09.900]  to brush my teeth twice a day you know I'm like racing to get my deodorant on
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:13.060]  in the morning but yeah we need to do a better job on that front I agree with you
[01:39:13.060 --> 01:39:17.660]  what do you make of under the new rural council in FEMA Homeland Security FEMA
[01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:21.420]  Department of Defense openly says without warrants they're already doing it
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:25.620]  they're coming to everybody's farm to teach you and a lot of times they come
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:30.140]  with guns drawn we had federally funded state game wardens rush on to our
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:33.820]  property as we're all just sitting there camping bossing everyone around and
[01:39:33.820 --> 01:39:37.860]  acting powerful until one person had seen one of the game wardens in a hunting
[01:39:37.860 --> 01:39:41.300]  magazine and knew his name and suddenly you know the guy got all happy because
[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:45.100]  he was being you know his narcissism was fed and suddenly they acted all nice but
[01:39:45.100 --> 01:39:50.260]  though you were part of a federal task force this country the federal
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:54.900]  the federal you mean the foreign banks that ship little kids out and ship drugs
[01:39:54.900 --> 01:40:00.100]  in you mean you work for them like we're all impressed oh my gosh you work for the
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:05.260]  oh let me get scared let me bend over to you and worship you I mean it's just
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:13.660]  when is enough enough God bless you I mean Obama says he's gonna be a
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:17.500]  dictator in the second term that's what he said and then they have this
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:25.380]  legislation in the map 21 bill to let the IRS take your passport and I'll let
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:33.660]  you travel totally illegal and they say they'll take your guns if they feel for
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:40.220]  any reason you're dangerous the IRS now is over guns I mean you're like well it
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:44.340]  won't pass it's neck and neck because the furor it was set to pass this week
[01:40:44.340 --> 01:40:50.620]  because the furor it's in trouble now but but there's people on YouTube in the
[01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:54.300]  video I shot last night and in the article saying I'm a liar when I'm
[01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:59.700]  linked to the bill just like you said I was a liar about Indie AA or a liar
[01:40:59.700 --> 01:41:04.460]  about your appliances spying on you or a lot no I didn't lie about any of it I
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:10.500]  told you the truth over and over again you realize how dangerous these global
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:15.380]  stars you realize they want to kill us you think they hate Iraqis folks they
[01:41:15.380 --> 01:41:18.820]  hate Americans about a hundred times they hate Iraqis the globalists hate
[01:41:18.820 --> 01:41:24.940]  everybody they even hate each other they're a bunch of devils okay let's
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:29.420]  say the devil doesn't exist they have our troops use DU and they know it soft
[01:41:29.420 --> 01:41:32.980]  kills them they killed over a million Iraqis with starvation the rest of it
[01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:37.340]  they use DU all over Iraq and the burnt effects have exploded they bomb
[01:41:37.340 --> 01:41:40.620]  infrastructures everywhere the globalist going and bomb water treatment
[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:44.500]  plants and electricity and never rebuild it on purpose they make the
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:48.980]  countries take Monsanto GMO they curse all of us I mean whatever you want to
[01:41:48.980 --> 01:41:53.260]  call these people that tell us oh 52 million aborted babies is good and
[01:41:53.260 --> 01:41:57.700]  let's kill babies up to age three now and let's kill grandma Bill Gates is a
[01:41:57.700 --> 01:42:06.300]  superhero and Newsweek remember the remember the case for killing granny
[01:42:06.300 --> 01:42:10.740]  cover of Newsweek simultaneously they were saying there's no death panels in
[01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:14.220]  this and government won't decide what your doctor does now they have the law
[01:42:14.220 --> 01:42:17.060]  they go yeah death panels are real we're gonna tell your doctor what they can do
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:22.260]  and again they play this game where we tell the truth they go oh no that's not
[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:26.340]  true you're like yeah here's your proof they make it all about the debate about
[01:42:26.340 --> 01:42:30.580]  what's true or what isn't instead of you just going out and finding out you've
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:38.060]  been lied to and anything that drops the trance anything that takes you from
[01:42:38.060 --> 01:42:42.540]  being like a child and they're the adult to you're an adult they're a pervert
[01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:47.860]  you're an adult you're a good person they're a criminal and reversing those
[01:42:47.860 --> 01:42:52.420]  roles that they're your loving guardian yeah like not for rotu's a loving
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:57.180]  garden of you know virgins in their bed at midnight or Hitler's a loving guardian
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:43:00.820]  and of people or Stalin's a loving guardian no they're not good they're
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:06.840]  not nice they're bad they're bad they're bad and that's why I go back to that
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:10.980]  Jesse Ventura clip because it's it's one of the most it's probably the most
[01:43:10.980 --> 01:43:14.180]  powerful thing I've ever seen on television you know that's real where he
[01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:18.100]  goes to the congressman who has the bill to expand the art existing FEMA
[01:43:18.100 --> 01:43:20.820]  camps and it gives us the full architecture of the camps how they
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:24.820]  work how they operate we already reverse engineered it he says I have the
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:28.260]  bill where you're gonna expand these emergency camps for people all over the
[01:43:28.260 --> 01:43:33.700]  country including for political reasons and the guy goes I do not know what
[01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:38.700]  you're talking about in this fake Georgia accent in Tennessee and Ventura
[01:43:38.700 --> 01:43:42.980]  says well here's the bill right here and he goes you mean the one with the
[01:43:42.980 --> 01:43:45.980]  green alien coming out of the machine to eat me
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:50.740]  Ventura looks at him and says no this bill and hands it to me goes I do not
[01:43:50.740 --> 01:43:57.060]  remember that bill and the reason I go over that clip over and over again is
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:44:03.540]  because when the hoax falls and that aired it freaked people out so bad and
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:07.500]  reminded them of all the other condescending stuff that the Homeland
[01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:11.220]  Security was threatening people and and there were all I can't even tell you
[01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:18.180]  what went on behind the scenes I mean people you know what I told I'm told
[01:44:18.180 --> 01:44:23.060]  some confidence and I just can't tell you I try to talk a minute telling you
[01:44:23.060 --> 01:44:25.380]  what went on
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:35.900]  hmm let's just say some people didn't make it I'm gonna stop right there the
[01:44:35.900 --> 01:44:42.740]  point is is that it they the hoax fell in that clip like he's got a bill and the
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:47.180]  guy's talking about space aliens saying why do you believe space aliens are gonna
[01:44:47.180 --> 01:44:53.780]  eat my brain and Ventura's like I got a bill about expanding camps and I see
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:57.060]  these trolls saying oh they're not coming after our guns oh no no
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:45:02.260]  Rahm Emanuel just said they do it this exact way it's like people going oh they
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:05.980]  don't want to have a national draft for a domestic femacore now it's been
[01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:08.740]  announced they're talking about making high school students be part of it for
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:13.620]  graduation and paying them because they're gonna bankrupt things so bad the
[01:45:13.620 --> 01:45:17.460]  new thing is gonna be a paid government welfare where you work for them and let
[01:45:17.460 --> 01:45:21.420]  me tell you something I get pulled over by some snot nose 18 year old punk wanting
[01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:24.540]  to grab my genitals it's over and they are training them in the in the new
[01:45:24.540 --> 01:45:28.660]  handshake of America where a potbelly pedophile grabs your genitals again if
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:31.500]  they can do that they can do anything the psychological warfare chief sit back
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:34.620]  and go how do we fully break these people well you get how do you get in
[01:45:34.620 --> 01:45:37.380]  southern comfort zone you got to do something radical you got to go all the
[01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:42.500]  way I've read the manuals on air this is their plan it's a they think we're a
[01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:51.460]  joke but here's the deal if we ever start reversing them it's all over that's
[01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:54.940]  why they're scared that's why they're holding on to a buck buckin Bronco
[01:45:54.940 --> 01:45:59.580]  eight seconds and you know what eight seconds is 800 years in this game you're
[01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:06.340]  gonna lose you miscalculated you sacks of pus all that matters to me is that you

[01:46:11.820 --> 01:46:17.420]  the pus gravy you try to pour all over everything that's good you may think
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:20.780]  death and destruction and burning cities and dead children is beautiful I
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:24.980]  think you're ugly I think your mind's ugly I think you're trash and I declare
[01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:31.220]  absolute 110 percent total war on every level at you
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:38.820]  it's time to find our humanity again look at this Daily Mail story the public
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:43.100]  is fed up former TSA chief again criticizes airport security checks as he
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:46.740]  claims current process is doing little to stop terrorist you mean the terrorists
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:49.380]  the US government gets on the airplanes like the underwear bomber I mean give me
[01:46:49.380 --> 01:46:53.620]  a break and he says the public is at a breaking point that's what the global is
[01:46:53.620 --> 01:47:01.100]  want they want it that's why we've got to spend every millisecond now getting a
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:04.740]  word out before they stage the next false flag that they're the people that
[01:47:04.740 --> 01:47:08.940]  give you the false flags like rattlesnakes they're the ones that bite you
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:12.660]  this criminal government they're the ones that blow stuff up to pose his
[01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:16.020]  saviors you ever thought about that you ever know how many other governments
[01:47:16.020 --> 01:47:18.660]  have been caught doing it our own government caught doing it it's not our
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:24.180]  government we got to get that message out we got to get the message out about
[01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:28.180]  the bankers running the government and let me tell you something you get that
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:31.260]  message out they're going down that's why Brazinski said we might as well just
[01:47:31.260 --> 01:47:35.700]  kill a million people that's trying to control him now in his new book he said
[01:47:35.700 --> 01:47:38.820]  in the past we could control him a propaganda it doesn't work anymore yeah
[01:47:38.820 --> 01:47:43.740]  you may be able to control some drooling TV sports fan who thinks that's real
[01:47:43.740 --> 01:47:47.340]  manly or some woman who's all into herself you care less but there's a
[01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:51.220]  large portion that only cares about freedom and it's never majorities that
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:55.620]  win wars and you know that and we got a lot more than our forebearers had in
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:48:06.380]  1776 let's go ahead and let's go ahead and go to David and Georgia David you're

[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:51.580]  a foreign company will process our votes in November a Spanish company SCY TL
[01:48:51.580 --> 01:48:59.300]  has acquired SOE the leading vote processing company in the United States
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:07.260]  this means votes will now be transferred to a central server overseas where they
[01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:14.580]  will be counted rather than being counted at the local precinct level I was
[01:49:14.580 --> 01:49:17.900]  aware that that company was doing some of it they're doing the national that's
[01:49:17.900 --> 01:49:23.780]  globalism have foreign groups run the water run the voting ship GM to China I

[01:49:58.740 --> 01:50:06.060]  the final step of Obama rigging the 2012 election and the formation of a global
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:13.020]  government why is the AP not covering this why is Fox News not covering this
[01:50:13.020 --> 01:50:21.500]  what we now have is a socialist CEO running the world's voting and election
[01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:32.020]  counts talk about a UN Marxist communist dream come true I actually found
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:36.020]  that it was in market watch Spanish company will count American votes in

[01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:08.340]  water and laughing as you get sick and die start purifying your water with
[01:51:08.340 --> 01:51:12.780]  pro-pure my friends I've done a lot of research and the best gravity filter out
[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:17.980]  there bar none is pro-pure and it's available discounted at info wars.com
[01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:22.060]  its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth there's no
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:27.340]  priming required its NSF 42 certified optional fluoride filters can reduce
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:32.660]  fluoride up to 95% easy to set up and use doesn't require electricity purify
[01:51:32.660 --> 01:51:36.820]  water from lake streams ponds and wells this filter system leaves in

[02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:20.020]  to the additives, the GMO, the fluoride, all of it.
[02:08:20.020 --> 02:08:25.020]  And he has, of course, Merkola.com, an invaluable site for news and information
[02:08:25.020 --> 02:08:28.020]  that I visit every few days, at least.
[02:08:28.020 --> 02:08:30.020]  A lot of great research there.
[02:08:30.020 --> 02:08:33.020]  He's been passionate about health and technology for most of his life.
[02:08:33.020 --> 02:08:37.020]  A doctor of osteopathic medicine, he treated many thousands of patients over 20 years.
[02:08:37.020 --> 02:08:42.020]  In the mid-90s, he integrated his passion for natural health with modern technology
[02:08:42.020 --> 02:08:46.020]  via the Internet and developed a website, Merkola.com, to spread the word about natural ways
[02:08:46.020 --> 02:08:50.020]  to achieve optimal health, and he's the best-selling author, researcher.
[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:57.020]  You name it, and he joins us here today for the balance of the hour.
[02:08:57.020 --> 02:09:01.020]  And I've got a lot of questions I want to get into, but I want this state.
[02:09:01.020 --> 02:09:03.020]  You know, we get the State of the Union from Barack Obama.
[02:09:03.020 --> 02:09:10.020]  I want the state, from his view, and research and focus on the battle for health
[02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:15.020]  and Big Pharma wanting to block that, what seems like an explosive awakening across the board.
[02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:20.020]  People wanting labeling to get away from GMO, the system moving to block that,
[02:09:20.020 --> 02:09:26.020]  the basic right to be able to see on something if it does have genetically engineered organisms in it or cross species.
[02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:30.020]  So what is the state of things right now?
[02:09:30.020 --> 02:09:36.020]  How is the Rebel Alliance via Liberty doing versus the Empire striking back?
[02:09:36.020 --> 02:09:40.020]  And then I want to get into what's number one on his radar screen.
[02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:46.020]  Of course, Merkola.com covers a lot every day, but what he's been really focusing on as of late.
[02:09:46.020 --> 02:09:49.020]  Doc, great to have you with us. Have been on for probably five years.
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:54.020]  Yes, thanks for having me on today, Alex. I really appreciate the opportunity.
[02:09:54.020 --> 02:09:57.020]  Well, you heard the question, what's the state of things right now?
[02:09:57.020 --> 02:10:02.020]  Well, it's certainly challenged, as you, your readers and listeners certainly know.
[02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:05.020]  But we seem to be making some levels of improvement.
[02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:12.020]  And the one of the biggest initiatives we have is the California ballot initiative,
[02:10:12.020 --> 02:10:20.020]  which has a really strong possibility of eliminating genetically engineered foods from the entire United States,
[02:10:20.020 --> 02:10:24.020]  just as it was done in Europe and even China.
[02:10:24.020 --> 02:10:29.020]  China doesn't allow these foods in their country.
[02:10:29.020 --> 02:10:35.020]  It seems like the momentum is starting to shift towards common sense though and health.
[02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:37.020]  But we see the feds rating people for no reason.
[02:10:37.020 --> 02:10:40.020]  You know, all of that going on.
[02:10:40.020 --> 02:10:44.020]  I mean, how do you see the battle going?
[02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:47.020]  Well, from what perspective?
[02:10:47.020 --> 02:10:55.020]  I mean, certainly they are making efforts in a variety of areas to suppress it even more.
[02:10:55.020 --> 02:11:02.020]  And it's just really sickening at best to see the examples continuously that get thrown before us
[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:11.020]  and of how they're effectively able to suppress this information and make progress that way.
[02:11:11.020 --> 02:11:14.020]  But I think, you know, really the challenge is to educate people,
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:21.020]  give them information so they can make their own free choices once they have once they're properly informed.
[02:11:21.020 --> 02:11:25.020]  Sure, to boil the question down, it just looks like it doesn't look like it's a fact.
[02:11:25.020 --> 02:11:28.020]  There's a giant offensive against family farms,
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:34.020]  against raw milk, against vitamins, against labeling, just against everybody.
[02:11:34.020 --> 02:11:40.020]  And I see that as a response to the big awakening I'm seeing as a syndicated radio host.
[02:11:40.020 --> 02:11:44.020]  I was just asking you, because you're probably one of the most, if not the most prominent person,
[02:11:44.020 --> 02:11:49.020]  you know, out there covering these issues in a professional, accurate way.
[02:11:49.020 --> 02:11:57.020]  What your read of the situation is as, you know, say a general in the wellness movement.
[02:11:57.020 --> 02:12:00.020]  Well, it's difficult to give you a really specific answer on that.
[02:12:00.020 --> 02:12:11.020]  You know, we certainly identify very specific examples of the challenges that are being put forth
[02:12:11.020 --> 02:12:15.020]  by this, you know, the corporate interest, the collusion and the fascism
[02:12:15.020 --> 02:12:19.020]  between major international corporations and the government
[02:12:19.020 --> 02:12:26.020]  and how they're able to essentially cherry pick many important regulators
[02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:30.020]  or important positions in federal regulatory agencies and governmental authorities
[02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:40.020]  so that they can pass laws and essentially legalize processes that essentially start to abolish our freedoms.
[02:12:40.020 --> 02:12:42.020]  So that's what we're struggling against.
[02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:45.020]  And, you know, we still have a voice. We had the Internet, thankfully.
[02:12:45.020 --> 02:12:49.020]  I think if we didn't have the Internet, it would be a pretty sorry-looking picture.
[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:53.020]  But because of that, we can inform people and give them information
[02:12:53.020 --> 02:12:57.020]  and they can really rally together and make some big, big changes.
[02:12:57.020 --> 02:13:01.020]  And now we notice, Doc, they're moving in to try to shut down the web
[02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:05.020]  and trying to curtail it and trying to...
[02:13:05.020 --> 02:13:09.020]  What's the biggest threats right now to health freedom that's on your radar?
[02:13:09.020 --> 02:13:12.020]  The biggest threats to health freedom?
[02:13:12.020 --> 02:13:22.020]  Well, it would seem to be an unbridled, continued implementation of what's currently going on.
[02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:24.020]  I think we need to have some big changes really soon.
[02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:30.020]  But I don't perceive it as any single biggest threat that's coming from so many different sides.
[02:13:30.020 --> 02:13:33.020]  You know, I think the economy is really a big one and certainly you talk about that,
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:39.020]  but the banking institutions and their complete control over the... pretty much almost everything
[02:13:39.020 --> 02:13:43.020]  and, you know, it makes it a real challenge to get anything done.
[02:13:43.020 --> 02:13:49.020]  And, you know, they've certainly devastated the economy to date
[02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:52.020]  and they continue to print trillions of dollars and that's a real big challenge
[02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:56.020]  when you're trying to make serious improvements for your health.
[02:13:56.020 --> 02:13:58.020]  Now, what's number one on your plate right now?
[02:13:58.020 --> 02:14:00.020]  What do you think is most important?
[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:04.020]  We've got a whole laundry list of questions. We're going to open the phones up for you.
[02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:09.020]  Well, we are very excited about this California ballot initiatives
[02:14:09.020 --> 02:14:15.020]  because we believe that this is an opportunity to actually eliminate genetically engineered food
[02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:17.020]  just as they did in Europe.
[02:14:17.020 --> 02:14:21.020]  So it's virtually impossible because of Monsanto's collusion with the federal government
[02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:25.020]  and regulatory agencies to pass any type of legislative process.
[02:14:25.020 --> 02:14:32.020]  In fact, just last week you probably were aware and reported on that Vermont had almost unanimously passed
[02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:37.020]  this genetically engineered labeling law, but then Monsanto threatened them with suing the whole state
[02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:38.020]  so they backed off on it.
[02:14:38.020 --> 02:14:42.020]  Yeah, why back off? It's like when the TSA said they'd blockade Texas
[02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:46.020]  if we didn't let TSA font little boys and girls. Why not call their bluff?
[02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:50.020]  I mean, why didn't Vermont say bring it on? The people would back them up.
[02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:55.020]  Well, it's an expense, you know, so they didn't want to invest tens of millions of dollars in legal processes,
[02:14:55.020 --> 02:14:58.020]  but that was the justification for it.
[02:14:58.020 --> 02:15:05.020]  But it's just an example that the current process is so sophisticated and cleverly manipulated by Monsanto
[02:15:05.020 --> 02:15:10.020]  and other big corporations that it's virtually impossible to have a legislative challenge,
[02:15:10.020 --> 02:15:12.020]  but a solution.
[02:15:12.020 --> 02:15:15.020]  But fortunately, for a large number of states west of the Mississippi,
[02:15:15.020 --> 02:15:18.020]  there's still an opportunity called the Citizens' Ballot Initiative
[02:15:18.020 --> 02:15:24.020]  where if you have enough signatures on a piece of legislation that the citizens signed to,
[02:15:24.020 --> 02:15:32.020]  which we just recently did, we were able to gain almost 900,000 signatures in California.
[02:15:32.020 --> 02:15:37.020]  So in the upcoming election in November in California, it will be on the ballot.
[02:15:37.020 --> 02:15:42.020]  People will have an opportunity to label genetically engineered foods for the first time in the United States.
[02:15:42.020 --> 02:15:44.020]  And why is it so significant?
[02:15:44.020 --> 02:15:47.020]  Well, California is, of course, the biggest state in the country,
[02:15:47.020 --> 02:15:50.020]  but it's also the eighth largest economy in the world.
[02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:52.020]  So that this legislation passes there,
[02:15:52.020 --> 02:15:57.020]  it will be literally the beginning of the end of genetically engineered foods in the United States.
[02:15:57.020 --> 02:15:59.020]  And we've seen this with other foods.
[02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:06.020]  The Pepsi recently was required to label some carcinogenic ingredients in their soda,
[02:16:06.020 --> 02:16:10.020]  and rather than label it, they chose to exclude it.
[02:16:10.020 --> 02:16:14.020]  And this is just the free market forces acting in exactly what you'd expect.
[02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:18.020]  So they're not going to have a label for California, a label for the rest of the country.
[02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:23.020]  Because previous studies have shown that once you put the genetically engineered label on it,
[02:16:23.020 --> 02:16:27.020]  and that's all this legislation is required, is to label it, give people a choice,
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:30.020]  that it's almost like putting a skull and crossbones on it.
[02:16:30.020 --> 02:16:35.020]  And people, 80 to 90 percent of people will freely choose not to purchase that item.
[02:16:35.020 --> 02:16:41.020]  And as you know, Doc, the articles from the late 90s in the Monsanto Caviterias
[02:16:41.020 --> 02:16:44.020]  where their scientists eat, they demand it non-GMO.
[02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:48.020]  And so they dare try to sue the state because people want something labeled.
[02:16:48.020 --> 02:16:52.020]  Imagine that in court. Okay, well, then you eat it.
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:54.020]  Absolutely.
[02:16:54.020 --> 02:16:57.020]  So, you know, we're really excited about this process, but it costs,
[02:16:57.020 --> 02:17:04.020]  there's about a handful of companies, Merkola.com being one that have donated about $3 million to date.
[02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:08.020]  Lundberg Farms, Nature's Path, Organic Consumer Association.
[02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:14.020]  So we're expecting Monsanto to put in over $100 million
[02:17:14.020 --> 02:17:19.020]  to finance the propaganda campaign in California to defeat this initiative.
[02:17:19.020 --> 02:17:25.020]  And we don't have $100 million, but we do have, you know, a large volunteer effort
[02:17:25.020 --> 02:17:27.020]  and the people who are listening to this.
[02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:30.020]  So, you know, one day we're launching a money bomb against Monsanto.
[02:17:30.020 --> 02:17:33.020]  So if any of your listeners would be willing to participate in that,
[02:17:33.020 --> 02:17:38.020]  they can really help this effort to really fight what I perceive one of the biggest threats
[02:17:38.020 --> 02:17:43.020]  to the very survivability of the human race, which is this massive intrusion of food
[02:17:43.020 --> 02:17:48.020]  that was never designed to be here and really cross species types of changes
[02:17:48.020 --> 02:17:55.020]  that have potentially beyond dramatic influences on really the sustainability of our food supply.
[02:17:55.020 --> 02:18:01.020]  Doc, I want to talk about that because we see neurological disorders, autism across the board,
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:03.020]  other diseases exploding.
[02:18:03.020 --> 02:18:07.020]  And in all the big studies, the scientific that are out there,
[02:18:07.020 --> 02:18:10.020]  with many of these GMO crops, they have organ failure,
[02:18:10.020 --> 02:18:15.020]  near total serility in three generations, in the guinea pigs and rats and things.
[02:18:15.020 --> 02:18:21.020]  And now we're just a generation or so, you know, 20 years or so in the life cycle into this,
[02:18:21.020 --> 02:18:22.020]  and we're seeing a lot of it.
[02:18:22.020 --> 02:18:26.020]  And as you know, they've never really allowed testing of GMO in humans.
[02:18:26.020 --> 02:18:31.020]  And I mean, when this all starts to come out, will Monsanto get in trouble
[02:18:31.020 --> 02:18:34.020]  or will they just get a slap on the wrist like dioxin and Agent Orange?
[02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:39.020]  Well, you know, they so effectively control the federal regulatory agencies
[02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:44.020]  that for every single level, and we've put constructed a graph,
[02:18:44.020 --> 02:18:46.020]  it's on our site that kind of shows these connections
[02:18:46.020 --> 02:18:48.020]  and identifies the specific individuals.
[02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:51.020]  But it's hard to imagine that any significant penalties coming out,
[02:18:51.020 --> 02:18:52.020]  just like the bankers.
[02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:54.020]  I mean, these bankers have stole trillions of dollars.
[02:18:54.020 --> 02:18:56.020]  Any single one of them ever went to jail?
[02:18:56.020 --> 02:18:58.020]  No, because they control the system.
[02:18:58.020 --> 02:19:00.020]  So I'm not expecting that.
[02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:04.020]  I mean, we're just hoping that we can allow people the freedom of choice to do that.
[02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:07.020]  But you're right, there's a study that was just recently done that showed
[02:19:07.020 --> 02:19:11.020]  that one of the toxins in most genetically engineered foods do one of two things.
[02:19:11.020 --> 02:19:17.020]  They either produce a resistance to a very potent herbicide called roundup or glyphosate.
[02:19:17.020 --> 02:19:20.020]  And that's the vast majority, maybe 85%.
[02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:24.020]  And then the rest of them produce a BT toxin, which is an insecticide.
[02:19:24.020 --> 02:19:27.020]  And this BT toxin was actually recently shown in some studies
[02:19:27.020 --> 02:19:33.020]  to wind up in the blood supply of pregnant women and their babies that were born.
[02:19:33.020 --> 02:19:37.020]  It's like 85% of them have this toxin in their blood supply.
[02:19:37.020 --> 02:19:41.020]  And we're told that there's no complications from it, but no one's ever looked at it.
[02:19:41.020 --> 02:19:44.020]  And we know infant mortality is starting to go back up.
[02:19:44.020 --> 02:19:48.020]  Let me see, the pesticide kills bugs, but then we're supposed to eat it.
[02:19:48.020 --> 02:19:51.020]  Again, the plant grows its own pesticide.
[02:19:51.020 --> 02:19:56.020]  And they have to have refuge areas growing for the bugs of normal food.
[02:19:56.020 --> 02:20:19.020]  Can we just have the refuge corn? We'll be back.
[02:20:57.020 --> 02:21:01.020]  You can also call to order 888-253-3139.
[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:03.020]  Don't answer it!
[02:21:03.020 --> 02:21:08.020]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings knowing it may be another bill collector,
[02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:11.020]  it's time for you to call 0-DET in 90 days.
[02:21:11.020 --> 02:21:16.020]  800-477-9256. Settlements, bankruptcy, and attorneys are not the answer
[02:21:16.020 --> 02:21:20.020]  and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[02:21:20.020 --> 02:21:24.020]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[02:21:24.020 --> 02:21:28.020]  0-DET in 90 days gets you out of debt in 90 days guaranteed
[02:21:28.020 --> 02:21:31.020]  without a payment plan and without attorneys or going to court.

[02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:07.220]  We're about to have big breaking news.
[02:24:07.220 --> 02:24:11.260]  You know, it's one of the biggest stories out there that Obama is going to ban children
[02:24:11.260 --> 02:24:17.780]  doing chores for their parents on farms, that's how the family farm trains the next generation.
[02:24:17.780 --> 02:24:19.180]  The children enjoy the work.
[02:24:19.180 --> 02:24:23.060]  That's why we have summers, and so children could work on the farm.
[02:24:23.060 --> 02:24:24.580]  This is a total assault.
[02:24:24.580 --> 02:24:28.340]  Now rural Montana religious colonies fight labor law.
[02:24:28.340 --> 02:24:30.540]  They're coming to shut down the Mennonites and Amish.
[02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:33.020]  They've already got CPS circling them.
[02:24:33.020 --> 02:24:36.060]  This is all part of a total domestication.
[02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:42.540]  And making us eat GMO, directly linked to organ failure in every mammal they tested
[02:24:42.540 --> 02:24:46.260]  on, monkeys, rodents, you name it.
[02:24:46.260 --> 02:24:50.300]  I mean literally hundreds of studies, hundreds.
[02:24:50.300 --> 02:24:55.860]  And going back to Dr. Mercola, who is our guest today at Mercola.com, really great to
[02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:58.940]  have you here with us today because I just really respect the work you're doing and also
[02:24:58.940 --> 02:25:00.340]  the activism you're involved in.
[02:25:00.340 --> 02:25:03.940]  People should support that money bomb coming up, I guess you said Monday.
[02:25:03.940 --> 02:25:11.380]  But how does the attack on rural communities, organic farming, farmers markets, whole milk,
[02:25:11.380 --> 02:25:17.580]  I know you see it out there, attacking backyard chickens, saying you've got to get a license
[02:25:17.580 --> 02:25:20.180]  to have a garden.
[02:25:20.180 --> 02:25:25.380]  Why is the system so scared and declaring war, or if you disagree with me, tell me they're
[02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:32.820]  not, on any form of true local sustainability in the name of sustainability?
[02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:36.100]  So when your question is the system, you mean the government is scared?
[02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:43.980]  Yeah, I mean big pharma, big agra, all I see is an all out assault against just any choice,
[02:25:43.980 --> 02:25:47.220]  any freedom, anything healthy, the farms, everything.
[02:25:47.220 --> 02:25:48.820]  Why are they doing this?
[02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:54.980]  Well fear I think is really the center of the motivation and it is a very effective
[02:25:54.980 --> 02:26:01.460]  tool that powerful and small groups of people use to manipulate the masses.
[02:26:01.460 --> 02:26:07.420]  So if you can effectively utilize that tool, you can control large numbers of people and
[02:26:07.420 --> 02:26:09.300]  that's what they're doing.
[02:26:09.300 --> 02:26:19.620]  So they're seeking to instill fear in people from making simple choices and motivate their
[02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:22.380]  actions and behaviors based on that fear.
[02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:27.660]  Oh so they're trying to intimidate people, all I see it doing is making it avant garde
[02:26:27.660 --> 02:26:34.740]  and cool and people are rushing out and trying to start farming and things.
[02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:40.300]  Well that's the practical side effect from it but they're trying to discourage that
[02:26:40.300 --> 02:26:41.900]  with these fear tactics.
[02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:47.380]  No I agree with you, I agree they're trying to discourage it but I'm saying I don't see
[02:26:47.380 --> 02:26:48.380]  it working.
[02:26:48.380 --> 02:26:53.740]  No, no I would agree also, I think that people are smarter than that and we still have some
[02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:58.940]  of the revolutionary spirits left in this country and as a result people are inspired
[02:26:58.940 --> 02:27:04.980]  to really react and respond the way that our ancestors did.
[02:27:04.980 --> 02:27:09.020]  Amazing, this is a short segment, long segment coming up and I want to take some calls.
[02:27:09.020 --> 02:27:17.260]  The toll free number for people to join us and I want to talk to Dr. Merkola is 800-259-9231.
[02:27:17.260 --> 02:27:19.940]  What else do you think is an important battle area?
[02:27:19.940 --> 02:27:25.620]  Really getting the GMO labels so we can make a choice, wow revolutionary idea, what else
[02:27:25.620 --> 02:27:28.340]  is front and center?
[02:27:28.340 --> 02:27:31.220]  Well before I answer that I just wanted to comment on one of the statements you made
[02:27:31.220 --> 02:27:35.340]  with respect to all these research studies showing the dangers of GMOs.
[02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:40.300]  Well there would be a lot more if it wasn't for the manipulation and the fraud and deceit
[02:27:40.300 --> 02:27:44.020]  that these major corporations like Monsanto have implemented, do you know and you may
[02:27:44.020 --> 02:27:49.540]  not realize this because it's not widely appreciated that it is illegal, illegal Alex
[02:27:49.540 --> 02:27:55.060]  for any research scientist to do an independent study on genetically engineered foods because
[02:27:55.060 --> 02:28:00.660]  it's a trademark patented seed and at the moment you begin to do research on it that
[02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:06.740]  isn't authorized by Monsanto they will initiate serious legal action against you if not throw
[02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:07.740]  you in jail.
[02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:14.100]  Yes I was aware of that, well then how do other countries and people release these studies
[02:28:14.100 --> 02:28:15.860]  they just don't care?
[02:28:15.860 --> 02:28:21.900]  I don't know, I mean it's beyond me, certainly Monsanto throws tens of millions if not more
[02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:28.500]  dollars that is seeking to prevent this type of information from being widely disseminated.
[02:28:28.500 --> 02:28:33.060]  Well to me the evidence is clear they're starting to lose though for all their bully tactics
[02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:36.420]  for all of it the momentum is shifting against them.
[02:28:36.420 --> 02:28:39.620]  Yeah I couldn't agree more, I mean certainly didn't Europe and once you give people the
[02:28:39.620 --> 02:28:44.380]  freedom of choice to make that decision whether or not they're going to choose to freely
[02:28:44.380 --> 02:28:47.820]  consume this type of food or not they'll choose not to.
[02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:52.100]  If they're informed and that's what we're seeking to do with the citizens ballot initiative
[02:28:52.100 --> 02:28:57.260]  California to defeat Monsanto and this could be, I mean this is a very limited window of
[02:28:57.260 --> 02:29:01.660]  opportunity if we miss this window I don't know there will be another one and that this
[02:29:01.660 --> 02:29:05.100]  may be the beginning of the end of the food supply in the United States so it's a really
[02:29:05.100 --> 02:29:10.380]  important issue and that's why we're so excited about this because it really is sort of like
[02:29:10.380 --> 02:29:15.660]  their Achilles heel it's a classic David versus Goliath battle and we are David on steroids
[02:29:15.660 --> 02:29:23.700]  and they are Goliath and they control the federal regulators and they outnumber us massively
[02:29:23.700 --> 02:29:28.940]  in their ability to fund this type of propaganda campaign they're going to throw at us.
[02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:33.620]  Powerful information we're going to take calls and cover a lot more with an amazing guest
[02:29:33.620 --> 02:29:38.780]  and a hard guy to get on the show, Hunter Joseph from Merkola, Merkola.com, I'm Alex

[02:35:31.380 --> 02:35:35.020]  this system by taking care of ourselves and getting along with our families and being
[02:35:35.020 --> 02:35:38.780]  civically involved they're gonna be at the houston metro meeting tomorrow fighting the
[02:35:38.780 --> 02:35:46.540]  tsa who's now doing body searches and bag checks on the streets and in buses the feds out of
[02:35:46.540 --> 02:35:51.340]  their jurisdiction doing what police can't do dr. mercola i want to get more into gmo
[02:35:51.340 --> 02:35:55.860]  and and i want to ask you other points you'd like to relay the fight against florida i
[02:35:55.860 --> 02:36:00.300]  started to have victories there before we go to calls but connecting health freedom that
[02:36:00.300 --> 02:36:06.620]  you spearhead with all the other sectors out there i mean really i think americans
[02:36:06.620 --> 02:36:12.980]  now are having it thrown in their face that this really is tyranny this is really happening
[02:36:12.980 --> 02:36:17.980]  what's your take on just how crazy things have gotten well i think it's fascism i think
[02:36:17.980 --> 02:36:22.580]  there's a big crux of the problem is related to this incredible collusion between these
[02:36:22.580 --> 02:36:27.260]  international corporations and the government that essentially they're able to lobby and
[02:36:27.260 --> 02:36:32.660]  pass legislations to make it legal to manipulate and deceive people and and really implement
[02:36:32.660 --> 02:36:37.700]  their agenda which is to increase their bottom line profits so you know but our big mission
[02:36:37.700 --> 02:36:41.580]  is really to help people understand how to take control their health and i'm glad you're
[02:36:41.580 --> 02:36:45.460]  making efforts in that direction too but there's very simple strategies the more you study
[02:36:45.460 --> 02:36:50.220]  health the more you realize that it's really very basic and simple processes like getting
[02:36:50.220 --> 02:36:56.620]  away from sugar or exposing your skin to natural sunshine exercising you know drinking plenty
[02:36:56.620 --> 02:37:00.620]  of clean water these are simple strategies that that really move your body towards health
[02:37:00.620 --> 02:37:04.820]  and away from disease and the challenge however i realize that they're teaching people this
[02:37:04.820 --> 02:37:08.820]  for for over a decade because our website's been around since night for about 15 years
[02:37:08.820 --> 02:37:13.540]  now is that it is sometimes very difficult if not impossible to implement these simple
[02:37:13.540 --> 02:37:19.420]  strategies because of this fascist fascist corporate control of the government that really
[02:37:19.420 --> 02:37:26.380]  puts these massive barriers and prevents people from making these choices because of the
[02:37:26.380 --> 02:37:30.860]  self-interested legislation that's been passed to to benefit these corporations well it's
[02:37:30.860 --> 02:37:36.380]  very simple activist role we're absolutely right it's very simple just it just hit me
[02:37:36.380 --> 02:37:43.100]  big agra merged with big pharma openly is lobbying for the food safety act that actually
[02:37:43.100 --> 02:37:47.900]  just shuts down local farms and lets big agra put out all their poison and get in trouble
[02:37:47.900 --> 02:37:53.900]  they exempt themselves in the laws but most family farms are barely hanging on and if
[02:37:53.900 --> 02:37:58.940]  the children can't help with the chores which they enjoy doing i know i've done it and learn
[02:37:58.940 --> 02:38:04.060]  how to drive the tractor and help get the eggs and you know help do stuff a they're not going
[02:38:04.060 --> 02:38:08.260]  to be able to carry out that tradition and because they won't know how to do it but
[02:38:08.260 --> 02:38:13.900]  b that's going to bankrupt them this is big agra shutting down their competition this
[02:38:13.900 --> 02:38:20.780]  is so criminal absolutely one of the person who runs our company was was raised as a farm
[02:38:20.780 --> 02:38:27.420]  boy and you know it's just imparted tremendous ethical and moral values i mean and when you're
[02:38:27.420 --> 02:38:31.500]  working that hard to provide a living for yourself and your family it makes a big difference
[02:38:31.500 --> 02:38:38.860]  and you know really molds a person into really a solid human being i tell you i mean i i've
[02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:43.060]  worked on farms just on the summers and then one year down in the country and for a large
[02:38:43.060 --> 02:38:47.740]  animal vet and that was it's really good to be around people that really work and then
[02:38:47.740 --> 02:38:53.540]  you come around the modern folks they don't understand getting into the work and actually
[02:38:53.540 --> 02:39:00.140]  enjoying it so many people i know do not understand the joy of working the land especially when
[02:39:00.140 --> 02:39:06.180]  it's yours and and and and they're trying to kill one of the final american traditions
[02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:13.620]  that's left it is so evil i agree it's a real challenge and when those farms small farms
[02:39:13.620 --> 02:39:17.900]  go it's gonna it could be the beginning of the end so we really make need to take us
[02:39:17.900 --> 02:39:23.180]  a firm stand against that because that's a really important part of our ability to provide
[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:26.660]  us with some of the basic foundational tools we need to say healthy which is healthy good
[02:39:26.660 --> 02:39:32.380]  food well it's time to get aggressive to and realize that eating healthy organics farms
[02:39:32.380 --> 02:39:37.300]  having local communities that support their local farms use an absolute coffin nailed
[02:39:37.300 --> 02:39:42.220]  a tyranny and that that they wouldn't have animal ID and premise society to shut down
[02:39:42.220 --> 02:39:46.500]  the farms they wouldn't do these staged events a doctor that i'm sure you've seen the news
[02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:52.660]  where to get animal ID premises ID in they give the blue ribbon for the calf or the pig
[02:39:52.660 --> 02:39:58.580]  or whatever to the beauty queen or whatever and then when when she got up or he got up
[02:39:58.580 --> 02:40:03.820]  to get the award they'd say excuse me this is not all over the country a few years ago
[02:40:03.820 --> 02:40:09.300]  they didn't do their premises ID their band from showing here and they were getting money
[02:40:09.300 --> 02:40:14.860]  behind the the scenes at the local fairground to do this event and and take them off the
[02:40:14.860 --> 02:40:20.380]  stage with deputies like they were criminal it wasn't the law you had to do that but they
[02:40:20.380 --> 02:40:27.500]  were implying they were bad i mean that's the type of dirty tricks doc were up against
[02:40:27.500 --> 02:40:32.580]  really takes an educated group of people to understand this and then take appropriate
[02:40:32.580 --> 02:40:37.540]  action and i'm really grateful for the services that you provide to help people understand
[02:40:37.540 --> 02:40:41.460]  this process but how diabolical is the is because i started seeing a pattern and then
[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:48.340]  later confirmed it was nationwide how diabolical is it to do stunts like that yeah it really
[02:40:48.340 --> 02:40:54.100]  hits the limit you know it's just they really will stop at no end it seems to achieve their
[02:40:54.100 --> 02:40:58.780]  primary goal which is to increase her bottom line profits well i mean i mean is it more
[02:40:58.780 --> 02:41:03.780]  than that with monsanto and others though i mean they know what they're doing yeah i
[02:41:03.780 --> 02:41:07.100]  mean there's a number of people and i would include myself in the group who consider
[02:41:07.100 --> 02:41:11.540]  monsanto to be the most evil corporation on the planet they're responsible directly
[02:41:11.540 --> 02:41:17.940]  for killing 250 thousand farmers in india through suicides because of the crop programs
[02:41:17.940 --> 02:41:23.260]  that they've implemented and creating a scenario that really makes them have almost no logical
[02:41:23.260 --> 02:41:27.140]  choice except to kill themselves i mean this is a type of evil that they have over there
[02:41:27.140 --> 02:41:32.260]  and tell folks how they kill themselves by consuming the pesticides that they that they
[02:41:32.260 --> 02:41:38.340]  produce that they buy from monsanto and i've also seen the studies that most of these gmo
[02:41:38.340 --> 02:41:43.380]  crops don't even perform like they say they will oh that's one of the big lies and it
[02:41:43.380 --> 02:41:47.220]  will be used massively in this propaganda campaign is that they that the justification
[02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:50.260]  for use of these genetically engineered crops is that it's going to feed the world that
[02:41:50.260 --> 02:41:55.460]  it will provide more food for the people with less and be more efficient and more effective
[02:41:55.460 --> 02:42:00.420]  when the when the truth of the matter is that the the the primary reason that genetically
[02:42:00.420 --> 02:42:04.460]  engineered crops exist is that they can use this herbicide called glyphosate which is a
[02:42:04.460 --> 02:42:11.220]  systemic poison and really kills weeds that go around there but it actually it it it
[02:42:11.220 --> 02:42:16.380]  weakens the plant and makes it less effective over the long term and it actually increases
[02:42:16.380 --> 02:42:22.620]  the use of pesticides which was promoted to when it was initially started to to decrease
[02:42:22.620 --> 02:42:26.380]  the use and it does the exact opposite so that just increases the sales and revenues
[02:42:26.380 --> 02:42:30.620]  for this just giant corporations well then there's all those mutations in the cotton
[02:42:30.620 --> 02:42:35.100]  plants too i was watching on television it does all this weird the people are like they
[02:42:35.100 --> 02:42:41.580]  lied to us they destroyed us and then now that i've planted this the old stuff won't
[02:42:41.580 --> 02:42:47.540]  grow in the soil now it's dead i mean talk about a plan yeah it's it's very devious
[02:42:47.540 --> 02:42:53.380]  and evil there's no question in my mind and that's why we're really putting all this time
[02:42:53.380 --> 02:42:57.700]  effort and energy to feed their nefarious plants and because we've got this limited
[02:42:57.700 --> 02:43:01.660]  window where we think we can make a dent and you know and if we defeat them in california
[02:43:01.660 --> 02:43:05.140]  that could be the beginning of the end of for monsanto at least in genetically engineered
[02:43:05.140 --> 02:43:09.660]  seeds and plants because they've they've got plans for for implementing this massively
[02:43:09.660 --> 02:43:14.180]  to having grass trees higher they there's only a few foods now that are genetically
[02:43:14.180 --> 02:43:17.300]  engineered but they're trying to get almost every single plant out there and control
[02:43:17.300 --> 02:43:20.940]  the entire seed supply of the world and by the way for those that don't know what is
[02:43:20.940 --> 02:43:27.460]  it almost 90% of corn's now gmo i mean once they get a crop they they take it over which
[02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:31.820]  is they've said food is a weapon i want to go to calls but but you're right this fight
[02:43:31.820 --> 02:43:37.340]  in california they're going to spend a hundred million bucks but word of mouth small donations
[02:43:37.340 --> 02:43:42.420]  what can people do describe the fight simply for folks explain to them what's happening
[02:43:42.420 --> 02:43:48.780]  a lot of listeners know but this big battle to simply try to have this this this move
[02:43:48.780 --> 02:43:54.420]  to label if something is cross species grows its own pesticide in it you know whatever
[02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:59.820]  the case is well we've already a small group of us have already donated three million dollars
[02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:04.460]  to collect the nearly one million signatures in the state of california to get it on the
[02:44:04.460 --> 02:44:07.700]  ballot so it will be on the ballot californians will have a chance to vote for it there's
[02:44:07.700 --> 02:44:11.460]  going to be as you mentioned a hundred million dollar campaign of propaganda by monsanto
[02:44:11.460 --> 02:44:17.340]  so if people can go to organic consumers association which is the one of the best nonprofit organizations
[02:44:17.340 --> 02:44:21.340]  for organic foods and just go to their home page and they'll be an opportunity there that
[02:44:21.340 --> 02:44:25.540]  they can donate directly to the campaign but it certainly if anyone listening this is in
[02:44:25.540 --> 02:44:31.180]  california could volunteer the reference to go and educate and inform your friends relatives
[02:44:31.180 --> 02:44:36.020]  and neighbors to let them know about this so they can actually vote yes on this and
[02:44:36.020 --> 02:44:39.300]  you know it's good they're going to it's going to need a they're going to require quite
[02:44:39.300 --> 02:44:44.780]  a bit of effort to defeat what's already present because the polls show over 80 percent of
[02:44:44.780 --> 02:44:49.500]  people are already in favor of this initiative 80 percent so they have to turn around 30
[02:44:49.500 --> 02:44:53.020]  percent so it would be a massive effort on their part but when you put a hundred million
[02:44:53.020 --> 02:44:57.340]  dollars you can you can sway things a bit well we're really we're really going to need
[02:44:57.340 --> 02:45:01.100]  all the help of energy we have because it's a david and goliath battle it really is well
[02:45:01.100 --> 02:45:05.860]  the electronic voting machines the studies of the top experts on like bev harris cannot
[02:45:05.860 --> 02:45:11.940]  steal a landslide that's why you need a total landslide or they'll steal it i mean you talk
[02:45:11.940 --> 02:45:16.580]  about dirty tricks they will use those electronic machines and then like have a propaganda campaign
[02:45:16.580 --> 02:45:21.300]  so people believe that you've lost but the point is the fight you will educate people
[02:45:21.300 --> 02:45:27.300]  you will win either way and this is the beginning of the end for their crimes against humanity
[02:45:27.300 --> 02:45:31.060]  when we do finally reverse all this their takeover of government they need to be held
[02:45:31.060 --> 02:45:35.780]  accountable because not just the doxin but or the age and orange or all the other crimes
[02:45:35.780 --> 02:45:42.380]  monsanto is is truly a wicked company but what really takes them down is the fact that
[02:45:42.380 --> 02:45:47.500]  you can pull up the mainstream articles folks just search monsanto cafeteria's gmo free
[02:45:47.500 --> 02:45:52.980]  their scientist will not eat what they're producing so remember that and the elites are all of
[02:45:52.980 --> 02:45:56.580]  course doc i know you know about this but i actually found it's even in the la times
[02:45:56.580 --> 02:46:02.060]  in places and and the chinese elite feed gmo to their people but they only eat organic
[02:46:02.060 --> 02:46:07.540]  the european elites are the same uh... what are these guys know that the public doesn't
[02:46:07.540 --> 02:46:10.620]  uh... which is that we've been saying they know it's not good for your health but you're
[02:46:10.620 --> 02:46:15.060]  right uh... with respect to this ballot initiative we you know they can control it through this
[02:46:15.060 --> 02:46:20.900]  electronic balloting manipulation and that's why we obtained nine hundred thousand signatures
[02:46:20.900 --> 02:46:25.260]  you only need five hundred thou five hundred five thousand to put up a ballot initiative
[02:46:25.260 --> 02:46:29.900]  on the incredible work but we doubled it just to make sure that they didn't manipulate
[02:46:29.900 --> 02:46:34.460]  on us i should have introduced you as spearheading that i i i i i i know you're not doing this
[02:46:34.460 --> 02:46:38.380]  to be prideful but you've got to be proud of the work you've spearheaded along with
[02:46:38.380 --> 02:46:43.220]  others just amazing job doc because it's it's good to see somebody really putting their
[02:46:43.220 --> 02:46:47.620]  money where their mouth is their energy and really getting things done you you are the
[02:46:47.620 --> 02:46:54.420]  model of of of defeating these people well that's we are so close but that's why i'm
[02:46:54.420 --> 02:46:58.460]  you know i'm really on your show and employing people that participate because i mean this
[02:46:58.460 --> 02:47:02.380]  is a limited window opportunity the window is closing and at some point we will not be
[02:47:02.380 --> 02:47:07.660]  able to defeat these guys with these evil incarnate you know and we've this is our chance so that's
[02:47:07.660 --> 02:47:11.620]  why i'm so excited to have the opportunity to really take them down oh you bet we're
[02:47:11.620 --> 02:47:16.860]  excited to be part of it here uh... what do you think of the fake environmentalists
[02:47:16.860 --> 02:47:23.300]  to say carbon dioxide evil pay al gore money for me they divert off of all the real environmental
[02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:29.140]  issues like chimera genetic splicing all of this stuff that we know is already having
[02:47:29.140 --> 02:47:32.740]  a devastating effect i mean you talk about really hurting the planet
[02:47:32.740 --> 02:47:40.340]  yeah there's no these guys are cleverly clever on steroids they they are in use incredibly
[02:47:40.340 --> 02:47:44.500]  sophisticated tools and techniques and one of them is what you prefer to though though
[02:47:44.500 --> 02:47:50.340]  create these ostensibly of public health oriented organizations the other objective
[02:47:50.340 --> 02:47:56.260]  and truth supposedly truth-seeking when actually they're just arms of of of the corporations
[02:47:56.260 --> 02:48:00.420]  and they're just they're spreading these false messages they're going to do the same they
[02:48:00.420 --> 02:48:03.140]  did that they did it when washington tried to pass it and they did it with organ they're
[02:48:03.140 --> 02:48:07.500]  going to do the same thing in california so this is the standard modus of operation
[02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:13.060]  yeah they're running around saying tax carbon dioxide that'll save us instead of like not
[02:48:13.060 --> 02:48:19.220]  eating stuff it's literally destroying us let's go to uh... red devil in illinois you're
[02:48:19.220 --> 02:48:27.620]  on the air with dr mccullough go ahead doctor mccullough i have a question for you my stepdaughter
[02:48:27.620 --> 02:48:35.700]  who is turning sixteen has contracted fructose malabsorption and i'd love for you to speak
[02:48:35.700 --> 02:48:41.580]  on anything you can about that to me but i'd like to make a statement first i just talked
[02:48:41.580 --> 02:48:49.500]  to a selective servicemen and they're being briefed on restarting the draft but thank
[02:48:49.500 --> 02:48:53.820]  you yeah that's actually been in the news but it's going to be a new domestic femacore
[02:48:53.820 --> 02:48:59.660]  tattletail squad that's actually on record now doctor his medical question well i think
[02:48:59.660 --> 02:49:04.300]  that is what i don't for your daughter i think you said it was uh... that the fructose malabsorption
[02:49:04.300 --> 02:49:08.780]  is actually a very beneficial thing and when you look at this condition in animals these
[02:49:08.780 --> 02:49:13.020]  animals live much longer because fructose is one of the most pernicious toxins that you
[02:49:13.020 --> 02:49:16.780]  can have in your diet if you have it in large quantities typically more than twenty five
[02:49:16.780 --> 02:49:21.780]  grams a day so it causes it's it's it will cause large amounts of fat it causes metabolic
[02:49:21.780 --> 02:49:27.260]  syndrome and it's in many ways is a poison not too different metabolically from alcohol
[02:49:27.260 --> 02:49:31.460]  so it's something that you really want to limit uh... so fruct not absorbing fructose
[02:49:31.460 --> 02:49:35.820]  is a blessing believe me it's a blessing so how much fruit should my children ate them
[02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:41.500]  well we have tables on our on our website uh... that uh... really list the amount of
[02:49:41.500 --> 02:49:46.460]  fructose because it really depends on the fruit so you uh... sugar uh... there's a
[02:49:46.460 --> 02:49:50.340]  in fruit sugar is has is a big percentage of fructose so you go you go to these tables
[02:49:50.340 --> 02:49:53.740]  and you look up the fruit and you see how many grams of fructose it has so if you're
[02:49:53.740 --> 02:49:57.980]  total daily fructose consumption should really go through just on average
[02:49:57.980 --> 02:50:01.180]  well some of the best are lemons and limes there's virtually no fructose or fructose
[02:50:01.180 --> 02:50:04.700]  free and uh... you know so you can almost virtually unlimited amounts of that but some
[02:50:04.700 --> 02:50:08.580]  of the berries are also low but if you have any if you have a two quarts of blue berries
[02:50:08.580 --> 02:50:12.500]  you're gonna have you know going to go over your limits so you have to have a moderation
[02:50:12.500 --> 02:50:17.060]  but if anyone questions that many people do then there is a simple blood test that one
[02:50:17.060 --> 02:50:21.580]  can do is called a uric acid it's a blood test easily gets on your doctors is really
[02:50:21.580 --> 02:50:26.380]  inexpensive and if that's over five point zero it's a suggestion that you're having
[02:50:26.380 --> 02:50:30.980]  too much fructose because that's one of the end products of excess briefly why is diabetes
[02:50:30.980 --> 02:50:36.940]  exploding so bad fructose and sugar i mean dr robert lustig and robert johnson will
[02:50:36.940 --> 02:50:40.900]  republish in his book called the fat switch in a month or so is really explained that
[02:50:40.900 --> 02:50:47.020]  in very specific details but it's it's too much sugar that's the bottom line in carbohydrates

[02:54:59.580 --> 02:55:07.340]  on xm channel 166 you're on the air chris go ahead hi alex uh been looking at the world
[02:55:07.340 --> 02:55:11.540]  in a with a completely different perspective over the last couple months it's been uh
[02:55:11.540 --> 02:55:17.700]  listening to your show i appreciate what you do uh growing up on a farm being involved
[02:55:17.700 --> 02:55:31.380]  in agriculture i've seen uh monsanto really has put farmers almost in a uh in a conundrum
[02:55:31.380 --> 02:55:38.740]  with uh with their choice of seed selection uh and they've been victim of the uh propaganda
[02:55:38.740 --> 02:55:44.980]  i know when i was going to college everyone said that bt was harmless uh now that you
[02:55:44.980 --> 02:55:49.740]  got it in in corn you know it's not going to hurt a cow or anything that that eats it
[02:55:49.740 --> 02:55:54.500]  and we all thought that was that was grand this was just the second phase of the green
[02:55:54.500 --> 02:56:01.940]  revolution um just like you had had kind of laid out beforehand but uh you know now there
[02:56:01.940 --> 02:56:09.060]  are no seed companies really putting a whole lot of research into conventional hybrids
[02:56:09.060 --> 02:56:15.060]  uh to offer farmers an option no that's right they've totally dominated the market um dr
[02:56:15.060 --> 02:56:20.260]  marcola comments on what he's saying i couldn't agree more and and that's part of the confusion
[02:56:20.260 --> 02:56:27.540]  that these companies use and that they they uh their campaign is to to can to merge the
[02:56:27.540 --> 02:56:31.700]  uh or to get the confusion between traditional hybridization techniques and the genetically
[02:56:31.700 --> 02:56:34.900]  engineering ones and they but they want people to believe that this is just a newer approach
[02:56:34.900 --> 02:56:38.660]  when they're radically different different yeah you're not you're not breeding two of the same
[02:56:38.660 --> 02:56:43.460]  you know variety same species together you're you're putting plenty it's totally different
[02:56:43.460 --> 02:56:48.580]  species but here's the thing monsanto's also buying up the heirloom in hybrid companies aren't
[02:56:48.580 --> 02:56:54.020]  they they sure are it's it's it's in their strategy to dominate and control the entire
[02:56:54.020 --> 02:56:58.100]  food supply of the world i mean it's a very in it's a very compelling business model if they're
[02:56:58.100 --> 02:57:02.660]  successful you know it's kind of like facebook they're going to control everything so uh you
[02:57:02.660 --> 02:57:06.420]  know it's different different industries of course but it's it's a domination strategy
[02:57:06.420 --> 02:57:12.420]  ahead of facebook called his his customers dumb bleepers i mean that's their attitude absolutely
[02:57:13.460 --> 02:57:17.780]  and suckerberg has his challenges okay let's jam in one more thank you chris great points

[03:00:06.900 --> 03:00:12.820]  our final segment with our guest dr joseph mercola i'm alex jones again thank you for joining us
[03:00:12.820 --> 03:00:16.820]  jamming in calls going quick here with these callers but what did you make of the last caller
[03:00:16.820 --> 03:00:22.900]  bringing up the fact that yeah he just went to a guy who can't breathe and has to have oxygen tanks
[03:00:22.900 --> 03:00:27.700]  because of agent orange and it's just like help them on santo they're our good friend
[03:00:27.700 --> 03:00:34.260]  everything they produce is like from the bowels of satan well they're actually going to be producing
[03:00:34.260 --> 03:00:38.820]  more of that because the glyphosate which is they're they i think they're using somewhere
[03:00:38.820 --> 03:00:45.540]  in 200 300 million pounds a year in the u.s. alone there because of the massive use of the this
[03:00:45.540 --> 03:00:51.460]  this herbicide these they're developing super weeds so they've got dozens of different species
[03:00:51.460 --> 03:00:55.780]  over 10 million acres that are they're completely resistant so as a result of that resistance
[03:00:55.780 --> 03:01:00.980]  they have to use other herbicides but that's good though now we've got to buy those from them
[03:01:00.980 --> 03:01:05.780]  after us and there's a long-term chronic toxicity from the exposure to these things
[03:01:05.780 --> 03:01:12.900]  and certainly lung damage and c o pd is is one of them so yeah it's persistent in the environment
[03:01:12.900 --> 03:01:17.540]  which is a real challenge and that was one of their their original assertions is that this
[03:01:17.540 --> 03:01:21.860]  thing was safe it didn't stick around but that's just not true as we're finding in oh they wouldn't
[03:01:21.860 --> 03:01:26.740]  lie to us i mean agent orange is good for you too harry in michigan you're on the air go ahead
[03:01:26.740 --> 03:01:38.740]  well yes sir well hi i got you doing good um 17 year listener um and um i'm on 65 year old
[03:01:38.740 --> 03:01:44.020]  health junkie and uh live the pain you can't hurry and by the way uh take the pain for a
[03:01:44.020 --> 03:01:50.420]  three times a day info wars team calm thank you yeah i had to give you get the credit
[03:01:50.420 --> 03:01:58.260]  where we're just do good stuff uh my question is um i'm um i was in vietnam to 65 and i was
[03:01:58.260 --> 03:02:05.380]  exposed to orange and um i don't eat i haven't eaten any junk food in years i got a 34 inch
[03:02:05.380 --> 03:02:15.940]  waist of 190 pounds 65 years old five foot tip and uh no no med is no nothing great but um my my deal
[03:02:15.940 --> 03:02:23.220]  is i i did um purging my system the years now with uh dehydrated water um
[03:02:24.980 --> 03:02:30.820]  is there another way of doing that or uh well you you're referring to doxification and and
[03:02:30.820 --> 03:02:36.100]  one of the problems with these uh pesticide exposures and and chemicals in generals that they
[03:02:36.100 --> 03:02:39.860]  tend to be fat soluble so they stick in your fat so one of the most important things is to is to
[03:02:39.860 --> 03:02:44.260]  optimize your body fat sir can you explain to me what dehydrated water is you mean yeah i
[03:02:44.260 --> 03:02:51.940]  i don't want to touch that one because it sounds like an anoxymoron yeah yes sir i'm sorry i didn't
[03:02:51.940 --> 03:02:58.980]  mean to distill water i'm sorry guys oh it's okay brother god bless you no uh from what i've my dad
[03:02:58.980 --> 03:03:03.220]  and you know he's a dentist oral surgeon he says doc is it true that he says okay distill
[03:03:03.220 --> 03:03:08.420]  it's fine but not all the time that it's a powerful uh you know cleanser and that it'll
[03:03:08.420 --> 03:03:14.980]  basically uh too much of it though it'll start stripping stuff out of you yeah it tends to
[03:03:14.980 --> 03:03:18.580]  remove some of the important minerals so it's not going to be necessarily good for moving
[03:03:18.580 --> 03:03:24.260]  things like agent orange and other heavy metals so heavy metals but pesticides so what strategies
[03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:29.380]  work best for that are things like infrared sauna and exercise where you're sweating so it's just
[03:03:29.380 --> 03:03:33.940]  sweating optimizing your percentage of body fat alone your body to excrete these things through
[03:03:33.940 --> 03:03:38.500]  your sweat and your urine and your breath are a really good strategy and you're having a really
[03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:42.980]  good diet you know staying away from sugar so those are really useful strategies that can really
[03:03:42.980 --> 03:03:48.500]  help your body eliminate the most of the junk so exercise get off sugar things like that to get
[03:03:48.500 --> 03:03:53.060]  the stuff out of your body one more quick call quick question christ in florida you're on the air go
