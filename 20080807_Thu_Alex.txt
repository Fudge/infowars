[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.560 --> 00:19.120]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.120 --> 00:26.520]  Texas Alex Jones we've been having him on a lot more than we did in the past
[00:26.520 --> 00:30.800]  we normally would have him two or three times a year but because he is in a
[00:30.800 --> 00:34.600]  unique perspective to track what's happening on the build-up for war with
[00:34.600 --> 00:42.520]  Iran and because he's fighting a potentially lethal form of melanoma we
[00:42.520 --> 00:48.440]  do have Ray McGovern top CIA analyst for Ronald Reagan and of course George Bush
[00:48.440 --> 00:54.800]  senior top briefer in the White House joining us for a full hour in the next
[00:54.800 --> 01:01.200]  hour today then for about 30 minutes in the fourth hour we are joined by a
[01:01.200 --> 01:05.600]  gentleman who just goes by Jimmy Justice so that he won't have any violent
[01:05.600 --> 01:09.600]  repercussions against him in New York City he is walking all over the city in
[01:09.600 --> 01:15.320]  the last six months videotaping police parking in front of fire hydrants double
[01:15.320 --> 01:19.840]  parking breaking laws even when they're off-duty in some cases even while
[01:19.840 --> 01:24.480]  fires are going on cops will pull up in front of fire hydrants to go in to get
[01:24.480 --> 01:28.720]  themselves coffee and sandwiches while there is a fire outside the police cannot
[01:28.720 --> 01:33.720]  other police that are showing up in the fire department cannot get hooked up to
[01:33.720 --> 01:39.360]  the fire hydrant because the traffic enforcement cop in one case supposedly
[01:39.360 --> 01:43.200]  enforcing the traffic laws are parked in front of it just an example of a law
[01:43.200 --> 01:47.920] lessness of government and the police union isn't saying police have done
[01:47.920 --> 01:51.800]  anything wrong they say it's fine for us to break the law Jimmy Justice is bad
[01:51.800 --> 01:56.040]  they were actually quoted in the newspaper for saying that that's what's so
[01:56.040 --> 01:59.000]  amazing about all these new police brutality videos coming out where the
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.040]  cop runs 15 feet out of his way to tackle a cyclist and slam their head in the
[02:04.040 --> 02:07.960]  concrete and then they charge the cyclist with assaulting the cop police
[02:07.960 --> 02:12.680]  union comes out and defends it or the famous video a week and a half ago came
[02:12.680 --> 02:16.400]  out the New York Post where the guy walks out of a store with a glass and I
[02:16.400 --> 02:20.800]  used to go to an outdoor barbecue the cops say come here you know randomly
[02:20.800 --> 02:24.280]  checking to see if it's alcohol the guy keeps walking so they run over tackling
[02:24.280 --> 02:29.840]  and then beat him full power huge cop with full force like he's swinging in
[02:29.840 --> 02:35.920]  the Yankees you know a top slugger just whacking the guy on the shins huge big
[02:35.920 --> 02:40.600]  bloody creases into his legs it just keeps beating and beating and beating
[02:40.600 --> 02:46.120]  and beating and beating and beating and beating and beating and beating and beating
[02:46.120 --> 02:49.520]  and you just clearly enjoying it with such force the baton flies out of his
[02:49.520 --> 02:54.120]  hand he runs over picks it up runs back and just starts slashing and of course
[02:54.120 --> 02:57.240]  another officer runs over and tells him to stop how dare that officer he's
[02:57.240 --> 03:02.080]  against the officers no that's a good cop that doesn't like brutalizing innocent
[03:02.080 --> 03:07.960]  people and who doesn't want police names and reputation being destroyed by bad
[03:07.960 --> 03:16.280]  cops like the one going crazy but all of that aside Israel Moles military
[03:16.280 --> 03:23.120]  option for Iran nukes it'll love how that deceptive headline makes it sound
[03:23.120 --> 03:26.040]  like from the Associated Press that they have nuclear weapons and they run
[03:26.040 --> 03:32.000]  this similar headline every week I want to go over some AP propaganda today a lot
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.800]  of other important news will be discussing the first big news story I
[03:37.800 --> 03:45.360]  want to cover today is anti-war website operator threatened by armed thugs and I
[03:45.360 --> 03:49.160]  know that information clearinghouse.info is an excellent source of
[03:49.160 --> 03:53.040]  information it is a clearinghouse of information they do something I wish we
[03:53.040 --> 03:56.520]  would have more personnel to do and that is they organize things in a really
[03:56.520 --> 04:00.840]  good sections showing the premeditated lies that took us to war false flag
[04:00.840 --> 04:04.560]  states government terror the number of dead troops the number of dead Iraqis

[04:13.080 --> 04:19.480]  others I know so when I see this MO it has a lot of credibility for me the

[08:23.360 --> 08:29.920]  by armed thugs information clearing house editor victim of home invasions
[08:29.920 --> 08:36.160]  warnings to stop what he is doing on the internet now I have talked to some of
[08:36.160 --> 08:39.760]  the other representatives at information clearing house just during the last
[08:39.760 --> 08:46.760]  break and they have sent me an email statement saying that Tom Feely does
[08:46.760 --> 08:53.480]  not want to go public at this time well you can't just say that you're being
[08:53.480 --> 08:58.520]  threatened in your life being threatened that you fled your home and then say
[08:58.520 --> 09:03.040]  that you don't choose to put out more information at this time and try to get
[09:03.040 --> 09:09.520]  the support that attention will bring you this is the exact wrong response now
[09:09.520 --> 09:17.320]  information clearing house where people writers who did put out the preliminary
[09:17.320 --> 09:23.240]  email yesterday saying that he had been threatened and went through some of the
[09:23.240 --> 09:26.560]  harassment of the last four years culminating with armed men inside his
[09:26.560 --> 09:32.480]  home that was the right move but you don't basically become half pregnant
[09:32.480 --> 09:39.600]  here you need to go all the way come out go public now and also you I'm so tired
[09:39.600 --> 09:44.240]  of seeing the establishment pick on the liberals liberals are scared to death of
[09:44.240 --> 09:46.920]  guns they're scared to death of men with guns they're scared to death of
[09:46.920 --> 09:52.880]  confrontation and they are the perfect targets for mafioso style probably
[09:52.880 --> 09:59.840]  private contractors and this only invites intimidation so I'm gonna go over
[09:59.840 --> 10:04.800]  the report then I'm gonna break down what the proper response should be for
[10:04.800 --> 10:10.920]  everyone history shows common-sense shows and my personal experience validates
[10:10.920 --> 10:15.320]  history in common sense anti-war website operator threatened by armed thugs
[10:15.320 --> 10:19.320]  information clearing house editor victim of home invasions warnings to stop what
[10:19.320 --> 10:23.840]  he is doing on the internet now the operator of a leading alternative news
[10:23.840 --> 10:28.360]  and strongly anti-war website has become the target and it is a large site
[10:28.360 --> 10:32.120]  it's almost as big as info wars nefarious thugs apparently in the
[10:32.120 --> 10:36.000]  employee of the US government who have continually harassed him and ordered him
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.760]  to shut down his website Tom Feely owner and editor of information clearing
[10:40.760 --> 10:44.480]  house info has endured public harassment home invasions death threats and
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.800]  threats to his family simply for running a website counter punch writer Mike
[10:49.800 --> 10:52.720]  Whitney who knows him personally and who we just talked to her in the break
[10:52.720 --> 10:58.040]  have circulated an email describing what happened to Feely in an attempt to draw
[10:58.040 --> 11:02.680]  attention to the matter we're working on getting mr. Whitney on coming up in
[11:02.680 --> 11:07.480]  about 20 minutes Whitney writes that earlier this week Feely's wife was
[11:07.480 --> 11:10.880]  startled to suddenly discover three well-dressed men standing in her kitchen
[11:10.880 --> 11:15.880]  who told her that Tom must stop what he is doing on the internet now and for my
[11:15.880 --> 11:19.400]  personal experience yes that's who they target they target your wife or your
[11:19.400 --> 11:26.320]  woman just like the Secret Service did with Anthony Yasha at Genesis two weeks
[11:26.320 --> 11:30.240]  ago they waited till he left and went intimidated her
[11:30.240 --> 11:34.840]  miss fiance stop what he's doing on the internet now to emphasize the point the
[11:34.840 --> 11:40.400]  thug pulled back his jacket reveal a gun while barking out the warning Tom's
[11:40.400 --> 11:45.400]  wife was hysterical and refuses to go back to her house she contacted the FBI but
[11:45.400 --> 11:50.800]  was told there was nothing they could do about it you know they use the FBI to
[11:50.800 --> 11:55.280]  harass people who aren't going along with Vonsanto's orders I mean they even
[11:55.280 --> 11:59.440]  harassed farmers they use FBI to do that and retired FBI and retired Royal
[11:59.440 --> 12:02.560]  Mounted Police in Canada that's even come out in mainstream news according to
[12:02.560 --> 12:06.880]  Whitney the well-dressed man told Tom's wife that he knew where her son lived
[12:06.880 --> 12:12.000]  that same MO we've gotten what line of work he is in and how many children he
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.560]  had that is exactly how they threaten you subsequently two men in a parked
[12:16.560 --> 12:22.040]  car a block from Tom's mother's house were spotted using laptops and sped off
[12:22.040 --> 12:29.880]  when they were approached by Tom's son a similar incident had happened four years
[12:29.880 --> 12:34.520]  previous when Philly was approached by a stranger in a parking lot of Long's
[12:34.520 --> 12:38.760]  drugstore in Southern California after being forced to remain in his car by an
[12:38.760 --> 12:44.600]  accomplice who blocked him from opening the car door the man told him you need
[12:44.600 --> 12:53.200]  to stop what you're doing and are doing on the web and this is exactly what
[12:53.200 --> 13:01.680]  happened to me twice 10 years ago and then nine years ago so everything they're
[13:01.680 --> 13:06.800]  talking about here minus people in my house if that happens and you don't
[13:06.800 --> 13:11.560]  identify yourself as quote law enforcement with a warrant you have got a
[13:11.560 --> 13:17.400]  big problem I think you can put two plus two together that's why they don't do
[13:17.400 --> 13:22.680]  stuff like that though here in Texas I'm gonna talk about that psychology a
[13:22.680 --> 13:28.680]  little bit later Tom said the men was overweight and had a shirt untucked Tom
[13:28.680 --> 13:34.000]  was taken back by after collecting himself and said what the bleep why do
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.640]  you think you were telling me what I can do the man answered Tom Tom I'm just
[13:39.640 --> 13:45.600]  giving you some good advice you should take my advice Tom that is exactly what
[13:45.600 --> 13:51.320]  happened to me exactly what happened to me in one of the occasions Alex Jones
[13:51.320 --> 13:54.120]  has experienced similar intimidation tactics on several occasions in the past
[13:54.120 --> 13:57.040]  particularly in the scenario that happened to Tom in the parking lot as
[13:57.040 --> 14:01.000]  well as thinly veiled vets against his family well they've been more than
[14:01.000 --> 14:04.680]  thinly veiled vets it's we're gonna get your children if you don't shut up I got
[14:04.680 --> 14:11.280]  a tough wife folks she just she knows she's just got a set her jaw but a lot
[14:11.280 --> 14:14.040]  of women aren't like that a lot of men aren't like that and every single
[14:14.040 --> 14:18.080]  instance the best response is to stand up and be vocal in the face of such
[14:18.080 --> 14:24.280]  harassment mafia like thugs only continue to feed on those who put up with
[14:24.280 --> 14:28.800]  such treatment the most dangerous thing to do is to counter and acquiesce to the
[14:28.800 --> 14:35.480]  will of tyrants that only invites more abuse more intimidation and attacks
[14:35.480 --> 14:39.520]  these kinds of tactics will only succeed if the thug thinks their actions
[14:39.520 --> 14:43.240]  can have any effect on the target every time someone in our movement is
[14:43.240 --> 14:46.760]  intimidated or harassed we should respond only by redoubling and
[14:46.760 --> 14:54.600]  intensifying our efforts I'll tell you this about Tom Feely he is not a BS or
[14:54.600 --> 14:58.800]  rights Whitney he is the real deal and completely committed to exposing the mob
[14:58.800 --> 15:04.280]  that is presently running our country he does not understand why as he says they
[15:04.280 --> 15:09.840]  are reaching down so far to get someone who just runs a website but the truth
[15:09.840 --> 15:14.080]  is they are someone wants to shut him up and they apparently have the muscle to
[15:14.080 --> 15:18.320]  do it he knows he is in danger well he's in danger because his wife's
[15:18.320 --> 15:22.120]  hysterical feely is that's only it's like blood in the water to sharks that's
[15:22.120 --> 15:28.400]  horrible feely is ditching his cell phone oh that'll help you with the license
[15:28.400 --> 15:31.360]  plate reading cameras feely is ditching his cell phone and maintaining a low
[15:31.360 --> 15:35.040]  profile but to his credit refuses to cave into threats and will continue to
[15:35.040 --> 15:43.040]  publish his website drawing attention to feely's situation is a paramount
[15:43.040 --> 15:46.840]  importance to ensure his protection and also to combat head on the attempts to
[15:46.840 --> 15:49.600]  create a chilling atmosphere and intimidate journalists and website
[15:49.600 --> 15:59.480]  publishers okay it's very simple we don't know who these men were and I
[15:59.480 --> 16:06.200]  believe the story but I would probably venture a guest to say that they are
[16:06.200 --> 16:14.880]  contractors or former law enforcement they may even be part of the Vikings a
[16:14.880 --> 16:21.240]  subgroup of criminal police in Los Angeles or it could be flat out FBI
[16:21.240 --> 16:26.120]  though I don't think it's FBI I don't think they're that reckless yet but I'll
[16:26.120 --> 16:30.640]  tell you this ladies and gentlemen the police tell you the state legislatures
[16:30.640 --> 16:37.040]  have told you the federal court rulings are stated that if a officer doesn't
[16:37.040 --> 16:42.600]  present ID and an officer tries to accost you and isn't an officer that it
[16:42.600 --> 16:46.040]  is a false officer and you have the right and the duty to protect yourself and
[16:46.040 --> 16:50.320]  federal and state courts have ruled that a police come in to your house without
[16:50.320 --> 16:54.200]  warrants and are engaging in violence you have a right to defend yourself now
[16:54.200 --> 17:02.880]  this is a basic mafia thugs come in your house brandish firearms you have a
[17:02.880 --> 17:06.640]  right to protect yourself they have broken into your house they are in your
[17:06.640 --> 17:12.440]  home they are common criminals whoever they are and I am not somebody that
[17:12.440 --> 17:15.160]  calls for violence on this radio show I'm not somebody who shoots my mouth off
[17:15.160 --> 17:21.320]  and like a lot of people do but I have repeatedly warned people do not come in
[17:21.320 --> 17:28.360]  my house do not come in my house and the police come to my home with a warrant
[17:28.360 --> 17:34.320]  that's another thing but if if armed thugs appear and break into my house
[17:34.320 --> 17:38.160]  they are going to be met with lethal force that is my right under the
[17:38.160 --> 17:41.080]  Constitution of the Bill of Rights that's what our forefathers fought and
[17:41.080 --> 17:44.680]  died for that's what this country is all about we are not a third world nation
[17:44.680 --> 17:50.720]  like Mexico or Guatemala or Indonesia where armed thugs just have their way
[17:50.720 --> 17:58.240]  of the disarmed population this is what the second amendment is all about and I
[17:58.240 --> 18:02.640]  assure you mr. Feely you were assessed you've been profiled for many years and
[18:02.640 --> 18:08.080]  they know I bet when I get him on the air at some time he'll admit he doesn't
[18:08.080 --> 18:12.440]  own guns he's a big liberal and they assessed you sir as somebody they could
[18:12.440 --> 18:16.520]  push around and they assessed you to know that this that that that they would
[18:16.520 --> 18:23.640]  be able to have success against you and your family with this now I have been
[18:23.640 --> 18:26.600]  through the fire and tested multiple times I have been physically attacked by
[18:26.600 --> 18:30.200]  four guys in a parking lot pounding me started fighting back against them they
[18:30.200 --> 18:36.080]  were shocked by it after I basically tore the nose off he had cartilage hanging
[18:36.080 --> 18:38.920]  out the top of his nose it didn't go into the brain it was driven out of the
[18:38.920 --> 18:44.440]  top after I tore his nose off with it with a vicious uppercut while the
[18:44.440 --> 18:48.080]  others were pounding me I don't have a really a fighting tactic I just attack
[18:48.080 --> 18:52.280]  one at a time I'll swing my elbow back you know I punch him with the fist and
[18:52.280 --> 18:58.480]  then just slash viciously like a wild animal my elbow back crashing in people
[18:58.480 --> 19:03.160]  start tackling me I just start full force driving my knee into him kickboxing
[19:03.160 --> 19:08.640]  and within 30 seconds of engaging these thugs they freaked out and drug
[19:08.640 --> 19:14.320]  themselves to their minivan and sped away then I got visits of people blocking
[19:14.320 --> 19:17.800]  me in parking their car in front of me to parking lot you get in they pull in

[24:35.880 --> 24:40.520]  have a First Amendment where they're beginning to censor and shut down large
[24:40.520 --> 24:46.120]  areas of the web and filter out alternative websites running random
[24:46.120 --> 24:49.360]  illegal checkpoints on our highways under federal funds taking our blood at
[24:49.360 --> 24:54.480]  checkpoints I mean the tyranny is all around us and growing and their the
[24:54.480 --> 24:58.240]  federal government is massively expanding its spy network it's it's it's
[24:58.240 --> 25:03.280]  human intelligence networks federalizing our cities
[25:04.480 --> 25:11.440]  meanwhile a major website owner editor has men in his house threatening and
[25:11.440 --> 25:15.360]  brandishing guns at his wife and remember Hoppy Heidelberg the foreman of the
[25:15.360 --> 25:19.200]  Oklahoma City Grand Jury who was trying to call witnesses about the other
[25:19.200 --> 25:23.280]  bombers multiple bombs in the building it was on all the newscast and the FBI
[25:23.280 --> 25:27.960]  did come to his house he invited them in and then they pulled back their jackets
[25:27.960 --> 25:30.600]  when he said he was going to keep asking questions and said you better not and
[25:30.600 --> 25:36.080]  pointed at their guns so there are many documented cases of things like this
[25:36.080 --> 25:40.480]  going on but these men did not identify themselves as FBI though it sounds like
[25:40.480 --> 25:45.200]  in the latest case they were dressed similar to that we now have the LA
[25:45.200 --> 25:49.680]  Times reporting and showing photos of black water mercenaries and rating a
[25:49.680 --> 25:55.000]  medical marijuana facility we know black water was used in gun
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.360]  confiscations in New Orleans that's now been confirmed by PBS with Israeli
[25:59.360 --> 26:04.640]  commandos foreign troops the government's hiring felons aggravated felons
[26:04.640 --> 26:11.000]  illegal aliens and illegal alien felons to join the military the Associated
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.800]  Press is reporting that police departments are now recruiting illegal
[26:13.800 --> 26:19.280]  aliens you can't make things like this up this is classical tyranny and if we
[26:19.280 --> 26:24.520]  allow this to intimidate us doesn't even scare me it excites me let's me know
[26:24.520 --> 26:27.760]  we're getting close to the enemy we're exposing them they're having to resort
[26:27.760 --> 26:30.400]  to these tactics it lets me know I'm right about everything about this
[26:30.400 --> 26:36.640]  criminal government this illegitimate government it just reinvigorates me and
[26:36.640 --> 26:41.000]  just as if I need any more confirmation of how wicked our enemies are this just
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.320]  confirms it further all of this train of abuses this train of tyranny and
[26:46.320 --> 26:54.920]  despotism now look at classical mafia in this country take Italian communities
[26:54.920 --> 26:58.680]  they would move here from Sicily and other areas ruled by government
[26:58.680 --> 27:02.960]  corruption for thousands of years and with the Sicilian mafia in New York
[27:02.960 --> 27:09.360]  City and New Jersey and other states other cities would they go intimidate
[27:09.360 --> 27:15.680]  the British or the Irish or the German communities no because if you went into a
[27:15.680 --> 27:20.880]  German shopkeepers shop or you went into somebody with the last names Jones shop
[27:20.880 --> 27:24.800]  or Johnson's shop and you said I'm gonna take 10% of the money you make each
[27:24.800 --> 27:28.480]  week and you're gonna hire my cousin just to make sure that he's into the
[27:28.480 --> 27:32.760]  bookkeeping and make sure you're paying me they would be physically attacked they
[27:32.760 --> 27:37.680]  would be shot on the spot there are a lot of historical cases of that but in the
[27:37.680 --> 27:42.120]  Sicilian neighborhood they were totally accustomed to the black hand squeezing
[27:42.120 --> 27:46.200]  them sucking off of them having their way with them and so the people would
[27:46.200 --> 27:49.520]  acquiesce to it and then those became sinners of corruption and then the
[27:49.520 --> 27:53.840]  corruption grew from there and that's exactly what we're dealing with here
[27:53.840 --> 27:59.120]  today they assess people they test people if I would have coward years ago to
[27:59.120 --> 28:02.760]  death threats and phone calls and your little dogs in the backyard and I'm
[28:02.760 --> 28:06.360]  gonna kill you and your little dog things like that when my girlfriend was
[28:06.360 --> 28:10.680]  only my girlfriend not my wife and then now women calling my house saying I've
[28:10.680 --> 28:13.600]  gotten them pregnant you know made up phone calls and then the calls
[28:13.600 --> 28:16.800]  threatening my family if I was to give into that folks they would only
[28:16.800 --> 28:25.000]  intensify but see we don't give into that we speak out about it we scream
[28:25.000 --> 28:30.320]  buddy murder we raise the alarm we don't give in to intimidation we don't give
[28:30.320 --> 28:35.880]  in and negotiate with terrorist and look at how the government the criminal

[34:09.160 --> 34:15.440]  corruption and to the offshore foreign owned mercenary companies operating in
[34:15.440 --> 34:20.400]  our nation shame on you military men but a lot of your foreigners now but still
[34:20.400 --> 34:26.880]  shame on you they've hired thousands of Latin American death squad operatives we
[34:26.880 --> 34:29.400]  reported on that three years before it was mainstream news now it's been
[34:29.400 --> 34:33.960]  admitted for two years to be used in Iraq Latin American death squads in Iraq
[34:33.960 --> 34:39.480]  they're there they're now exporting death squads Los Zeta's Mexican paramilitaries

[34:44.440 --> 34:50.280]  San Antonio Texas Austin Texas it's it's just amazing the things that are
[34:50.280 --> 34:54.960]  already going on and happening and don't think for a minute I think that I'm
[34:54.960 --> 34:59.080]  bulletproof or that I'm invincible or I'm tough stuff or that I'm saying bring
[34:59.080 --> 35:04.520]  it on you are the ones bringing it on you are the ones that have us cornered
[35:04.520 --> 35:08.680]  we don't have anywhere to go this is our country you're destroying our dollar
[35:08.680 --> 35:13.000]  destroying our name destroying our treasury turning our schools into
[35:13.000 --> 35:16.840]  prisons brainwashing our children drugging the population shipping in
[35:16.840 --> 35:24.560]  deadly narcotics all over our streets and you just keep pushing and pushing and
[35:24.560 --> 35:30.280]  pushing I wasn't one-tenth as radical as I am now back in the late 90s when I was
[35:30.280 --> 35:34.600]  physically attacked and threatened and had was stalked and had all sorts of
[35:34.600 --> 35:40.080]  other things happen and that let me know just how real it was I was talking
[35:40.080 --> 35:44.880]  about tame issues compared to this and they came and tried to intimidate me I
[35:44.880 --> 35:50.400]  am not about to discredit my family name and who my ancestors are we do not come
[35:50.400 --> 35:57.160]  from shrieking violence we do not come from people we do not descend from
[35:57.160 --> 36:00.360]  individuals that were cowards and let people tell them what they could say or
[36:00.360 --> 36:05.360]  what they could do or what they could write what they could broadcast that is
[36:05.360 --> 36:08.760]  not what the United States is about that is not what the red white and blue
[36:08.760 --> 36:12.160]  stands for I don't care if you try to expropriate it and wrap it around
[36:12.160 --> 36:21.280]  fascism and expropriate our sacred symbols and a lot of you out there I'm
[36:21.280 --> 36:25.000]  a big fish in this and look I'm still alive people to talk about me as the
[36:25.000 --> 36:28.960]  canary in the coal mine and frankly I am other canaries in the coal mine have
[36:28.960 --> 36:33.480]  dropped have been have died people like Bill Cooper who they could set up and
[36:33.480 --> 36:37.400]  harass week after week driving on his property making noise getting him to
[36:37.400 --> 36:49.520]  come outside and they gunned him down I don't have any illusions about my
[36:49.520 --> 36:55.160]  safety my security I am committed to this I have turned my life over to the
[36:55.160 --> 36:59.640]  cause of liberty whatever the case may be now I try to not be a hothead I try to
[36:59.640 --> 37:05.840]  not let them set me up and I remember right when we released terror storm I
[37:05.840 --> 37:12.600]  went and had a video shining at book people in Austin Texas the biggest
[37:12.600 --> 37:17.400]  independent bookstore in Texas and there were about 250 people showed up for it
[37:17.400 --> 37:25.720]  and I've been getting death threats all week long vicious death threats and so
[37:25.720 --> 37:33.480]  I called a police officer I know was also is in the special forces friend of
[37:33.480 --> 37:37.760]  mine and I said when you're gonna be off duty can you come to the event
[37:37.760 --> 37:43.000]  Sillian Italians who have still been called from the old country and if we
[37:43.000 --> 37:47.240]  laid out of the corruption it will grow it will set in and then it will expand
[37:47.240 --> 37:56.160]  just like the Asian triad mafia gangs do they go into the black owned or the
[37:56.160 --> 38:03.920]  wasp owned do they go into the Americana stores no they go into the China towns
[38:03.920 --> 38:10.800]  and they shake down the shopkeepers and the people there the Mexican gangs who
[38:10.800 --> 38:14.920]  do they shake down they shake down other Mexicans who aren't citizens and who
[38:14.920 --> 38:20.080]  are accustomed to being shaken down for Mordito or the little bite the beak
[38:20.080 --> 38:27.920]  dipping the payoffs but now more and more reports come out in Texas and
[38:27.920 --> 38:30.880]  California where the police are demanding money on the side of the
[38:30.880 --> 38:43.080]  road see we're becoming like Mexico or like Sicily or Malaysia we come from
[38:43.080 --> 38:50.680]  hard-working strong individuals that would have violently lashed out at
[38:50.680 --> 38:55.720]  anyone who tried to oppress them or enslave them the people that came to
[38:55.720 --> 38:59.600]  this nation were individuals leaving tyranny and they were coming here to
[38:59.600 --> 39:03.760]  fight to carve out a place where they could at least live in some dignity and
[39:03.760 --> 39:14.440]  honor if you insulted a man of the West just 200 years ago you would be in the
[39:14.440 --> 39:24.200]  street having a duel with a saber or a musket and it's that attitude that kept
[39:24.200 --> 39:27.920]  corruption at bay didn't mean it didn't exist but it hid out it was under the
[39:27.920 --> 39:34.880]  table it was paranoid it was sneaky not out of the open roaring arrogantly
[39:34.880 --> 39:41.160]  trying to intimidate the entire mass into submission and that's why you don't
[39:41.160 --> 39:52.880]  have or didn't have mafia in Texas in Georgia in West Virginia in Colorado in
[39:52.880 --> 40:02.000]  Arizona in Montana in Wyoming in places like that because if somebody walked
[40:02.000 --> 40:09.320]  in I mean I know both my grandfathers you know they were kind of the last of
[40:09.320 --> 40:12.880]  that top generation if somebody I remember hearing of a few similar cases
[40:12.880 --> 40:15.640]  just were where somebody tried to threaten them or demand something from
[40:15.640 --> 40:22.480]  them and then they would just physically go after them and there wasn't even any
[40:22.480 --> 40:28.480]  thinking about it you come in and demand something you come in as a mafia
[40:28.480 --> 40:32.600]  thug I mean if a mafia thug walked into my office and walked right in here and
[40:32.600 --> 40:36.000]  brandished a firearm I would reach right underneath my desk and I would open
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.160]  fire on their center of mass until I unloaded the firearm and then I'd call
[40:41.160 --> 40:49.200]  911 and that's radical that is bravado that's who Alex tough guy no that is an
[40:49.200 --> 40:56.160]  instinct of liberty that is an instinct of a man leave me alone that's why the
[40:56.160 --> 41:02.040]  old flag was the rattlesnake don't tread on me one of the revolutionary war
[41:02.040 --> 41:08.040]  militia flags it meant leave me alone I'm curled up right here get out of my way
[41:08.040 --> 41:15.520]  I don't belong to you you see the tail you see the rattles you hear that back
[41:15.520 --> 41:21.640]  off we're gonna have our websites we're gonna write our news stories when it
[41:21.640 --> 41:25.120]  comes out the Dick Channing was planning to dress up Navy Seals and fake
[41:25.120 --> 41:30.600]  Iranian patrol boats and attack our own ships and its mainstream news we're
[41:30.600 --> 41:33.080]  gonna put it out and make sure it gets covered by bigger outlets we're gonna
[41:33.080 --> 41:37.960]  magnify it that's what we are as an amplifier big old amplifier big old
[41:37.960 --> 41:42.280]  megaphone and you know what you can do whatever you're gonna do you don't think
[41:42.280 --> 41:45.440]  I don't know they have hit men on every major force you don't think I don't know
[41:45.440 --> 41:48.760]  they could send some of their Austin's hit men I know they got hit men on even
[41:48.760 --> 41:53.880]  on the Austin force you don't think I don't know I mean they kill CIA guys they
[41:53.880 --> 41:56.600]  kill whoever they want all the time you don't think I don't know you can't pull
[41:56.600 --> 42:00.440]  me over and then plant a gun on me shoot me a couple times in the head it can
[42:00.440 --> 42:05.160]  even be on video and nobody gets in trouble I know I'm committed you don't
[42:05.160 --> 42:11.280]  think I don't know but you can poison me or do a hundred other things just
[42:11.280 --> 42:16.560]  understand I'm committed understand you kill me my message only gets bigger you
[42:16.560 --> 42:21.240]  think it's amplified now and they don't like that these thugs don't like that
[42:21.240 --> 42:28.040]  with people that are committed and I'll tell you something too in the past if
[42:28.040 --> 42:32.320]  thugs or carbon baggers when they did come into the South and this happened
[42:32.320 --> 42:36.560]  after the Civil War they tried to come in and oppress and enslave people and you
[42:36.560 --> 42:40.040]  know what happened they might corner a family rape the women kill them they
[42:40.040 --> 42:44.360]  might burn down a farm but it might be a year later it might be two years later
[42:44.360 --> 42:48.600]  it might be three years later the captains of those operations might be
[42:48.600 --> 42:52.880]  living in a whole other state a lot of famous cases of this and he's in there
[42:52.880 --> 42:57.800]  saddling up his horse one morning right into town and you hear a gun cock behind
[42:57.800 --> 43:01.040]  you and you turn around and you know why I'm here you know what you did to my
[43:01.040 --> 43:11.880]  cousin get on your knees I'm gonna blow your head off right now and I'm gonna
[43:11.880 --> 43:17.280]  tell you ladies and gentlemen that the crimes that are being committed against
[43:17.280 --> 43:23.400]  innocent decent people are going to be avenged and if I'm killed you better
[43:23.400 --> 43:31.680]  believe that it's going to be avenged and that's why they want their casual
[43:31.680 --> 43:35.600]  society tracking grid to measure and track and or everybody's at every time
[43:35.600 --> 43:39.680]  and and and to with pre-crime try to predict what you're gonna do and now
[43:39.680 --> 43:42.360]  they're setting precedents to arrest you because they know they're gonna commit
[43:42.360 --> 43:45.640]  incredible crimes and they know history and they know there's gonna be
[43:45.640 --> 43:51.320]  resistance to it and they know this is an armed country so it's an important
[43:51.320 --> 43:57.880]  message to tyranny unless you want to live in a mafia amusement park where
[43:57.880 --> 44:04.040]  you're the amusement and they're in there having fun with you unless you
[44:04.040 --> 44:10.040]  want to live under that type of oppression and evil you'd better grow a
[44:10.040 --> 44:23.680]  pair right now I got this I have several emails here I don't think I printed off

[53:04.280 --> 53:17.520]  Bottom line when you coward like third-world slaves you will be abused when you stand up like our
[53:17.520 --> 53:29.520]  forebears with strength and honor. Thugs disappear like phantoms at dawn and
[53:29.520 --> 53:32.320]  yes for those out there doubting the terror you've never experienced it I
[53:32.320 --> 53:37.600]  have personally experienced it I know how real it is. I mean I go to the
[53:37.600 --> 53:42.080]  Bilderberg group and bullhorn world government meetings to the point of
[53:42.080 --> 53:45.960]  where the head of the CFR comes out and gives me vicious dirty looks and with
[53:45.960 --> 53:50.600]  secret police following us around in clown mask to try to freak us out like
[53:50.600 --> 53:57.760]  John Wayne Gacy. I'm committed it's in God's hands so you stop thinking you're
[53:57.760 --> 54:03.120]  in danger out there yes you'll be tested if you get prominent but that's what
[54:03.120 --> 54:08.640]  life's all about. The real heroes are people that have alternative websites
[54:08.640 --> 54:12.160]  and exposed tyranny and investigative journalists who go through the fire it
[54:12.160 --> 54:17.640]  isn't Brett Favre it isn't baseball or football or basketball the real heroes of
[54:17.640 --> 54:22.040]  the people fighting for our liberty as darkness falls on this nation and don't
[54:22.040 --> 54:24.480]  think it's a lot at the end of the tunnel George Bush about to leave office
[54:24.480 --> 54:28.160]  it's only going to get worse because this time goes on this intensifies.
[54:28.160 --> 54:39.520]  Zach in New York you're on the air come on Zach okay go ahead sir oh now here I
[54:39.520 --> 54:45.440]  am okay you know understanding what you're describing you know psychologically
[54:45.440 --> 54:49.480]  as concept is one thing but what I think what you're talking about is having a
[54:49.480 --> 54:55.200]  right attitude and that is a lot more that's a much bigger thing because I
[54:55.200 --> 55:00.480]  you know I grew up you know doing a pledge of allegiance and having the
[55:00.480 --> 55:06.560]  dare officer come and tell me about stuff and you know it's I don't really
[55:06.560 --> 55:11.200]  I mean I understand what you're saying I know it's true and I believe it but
[55:11.200 --> 55:17.160]  internalizing that and having that be my personal perspective and I still
[55:17.160 --> 55:21.000]  know what I get by the email they put out and and by talking to them behind
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.840]  the scenes and what I get from many others is now just men not identifying
[55:25.840 --> 55:30.760]  themselves with guns is authority and so now it might be guys robbing a bank
[55:30.760 --> 55:35.040]  maybe when cops show up at a bank robbery if the guys are wearing suits robbing
[55:35.040 --> 55:38.880]  the bank maybe the cops will salute them it's just don't know who you are you're
[55:38.880 --> 55:43.280]  threatening a woman in her house it's the authority we better just give in to
[55:43.280 --> 55:47.720]  it I mean we're that dumb down we just lay down to any anybody with a gun now
[55:47.720 --> 55:53.800]  well you know if you remember Apollo 13 it is a conversation going on he says
[55:53.800 --> 55:57.880]  that you know this is the greatest disaster in in NASA's history and then
[55:57.880 --> 56:02.080]  Ed Harris turns around he says that with all due respect or I believe this is
[56:02.080 --> 56:07.040]  our finest hour and I think the worst things get it's kind of like I have a
[56:07.040 --> 56:11.400]  friend who's an major alcoholic and when he was doing a thing I didn't really I
[56:11.400 --> 56:15.200]  did not gonna annoy him and say you should stop it's just a process that has
[56:15.200 --> 56:19.960]  to see its way through and in the end either you'll crash through with your
[56:19.960 --> 56:25.920]  bounce back and I think it is going to be very awful and it's gonna be very
[56:25.920 --> 56:29.640]  painful but in the end we're gonna be better for it and it's gonna be a
[56:29.640 --> 56:33.840]  beautiful beautiful future and well I hope you're right I've also had a couple
[56:33.840 --> 56:38.960]  friends die when they're like 25 30 years old because people said oh they'll
[56:38.960 --> 56:42.200]  tell they'll get over being alcoholics and then it fried their liver and they
[56:42.200 --> 56:50.520]  died well you know I just I I'm trying to have the right attitude myself and I'm
[56:50.520 --> 56:58.040]  trying to just to to maintain even you know going day-to-day it can be very
[56:58.040 --> 57:03.640]  frustrating having all this nonsense going and having this on my mind now I
[57:03.640 --> 57:07.040]  hear you but we need to have it on our mind we need to deal with it I agree
[57:07.040 --> 57:11.720]  think positive but act to be the change you want to see in the world don't stop
[57:11.720 --> 57:15.280]  and you know what I'm afraid of I'm afraid of these thugs coming around me
[57:15.280 --> 57:18.640]  again I mean I've already physically attacked them once when they attack me I
[57:18.640 --> 57:25.480]  mean I'm not afraid of them coming I'm not afraid of them I'm afraid of what
[57:25.480 --> 57:33.160]  will happen I mean you know I mean I'm not a tough guy I'm just a man folks and
[57:33.160 --> 57:37.000]  I've got my instincts in line and I'm vicious and people better just stay the
[57:37.000 --> 57:40.720]  hell away from me you know well they better come up behind me when they do

[1:07:23.240 --> 1:07:27.880]  White House Breaker Ronald Reagan George Bush senior top-level CIA analyst
[1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:33.320]  Army officer is our guest and we really appreciate him giving us so much time
[1:07:33.320 --> 1:07:38.000]  the last few months he's also battling melanoma we're told it's going well so
[1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:41.200]  thank God for that rainbow government needs your prayers and he's a great guy
[1:07:41.200 --> 1:07:45.480]  he's spoken out for 9-11 truth calling for new investigation I want to get into
[1:07:45.480 --> 1:07:50.120]  Cy Hirsch who by the way we did talk to Cy Hirsch I'm just gonna leave it that
[1:07:50.120 --> 1:07:54.080]  look for him soon on the show and breaking news I'm gonna leave it at that
[1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:59.440]  because that's what he asked us to do but he'll be here soon 12 targets that
[1:07:59.440 --> 1:08:04.600]  Dick Cheney wanted to attack the one he released at a journalism conference two
[1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:08.320]  weeks ago finally hit YouTube last week we grabbed it shoved it out big time
[1:08:08.320 --> 1:08:10.960]  two nights later because of you the listeners I said get this out to
[1:08:10.960 --> 1:08:15.520]  everybody email it to all news agencies call them Keith Oberman did cover it
[1:08:15.520 --> 1:08:20.960]  last Friday night so it's been on MSNBC that they were planning to create fake
[1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:27.320]  Iranian patrol boats and have a quote shootout between the Navy Seals and a
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:32.600]  major ship a major naval ship this is unbelievable and somehow Dick Cheney
[1:08:32.600 --> 1:08:36.560]  was overruled Cy Hirsch will not say yet because he doesn't want to give up his
[1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:40.520]  source if he says too much they can pinpoint who it was in the meeting or
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:44.600]  which meeting it was but he says he's got a new report coming out in the next
[1:08:44.600 --> 1:08:48.400]  month and a half I'm just gonna leave it at that I don't want to bring out too
[1:08:48.400 --> 1:08:51.800]  much here but we're gonna get rainbow governor's take on that as well because
[1:08:51.800 --> 1:08:56.200]  he's been warning for three years of a stage govleton can so is Ron Paul these
[1:08:56.200 --> 1:09:00.560]  guys have got good political minds to be able to I mean I was saying another
[1:09:00.560 --> 1:09:03.600]  false flag here domestically or something in Israel they're going no it'll be
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:07.400]  something with ships that's what we think and then that's what it's turning
[1:09:07.400 --> 1:09:09.480]  out to be they tried something a few months ago as you know with the fake
[1:09:09.480 --> 1:09:12.680]  radio transmissions but mr. McGovern let's get into that a little bit later
[1:09:12.680 --> 1:09:17.720]  first off information clearinghouse very credible I've been talking to some of
[1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:22.160]  the counterpunch writers they've confirmed this did go on but the editor
[1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:26.160]  and owner doesn't want to talk about now his wife is beside herself she came in
[1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:30.560]  the kitchen for armed guys brandish guns and suits and said we're not gonna tell
[1:09:30.560 --> 1:09:34.760]  you who we are but we know who your kids are and you and your family better just
[1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:39.200]  shut up and stop having this anti-war site it's one of the largest sites not
[1:09:39.200 --> 1:09:44.280]  as big as ours but close it's when the top ten and that happened I have been
[1:09:44.280 --> 1:09:47.760]  physically attacked before I've had death threats they just started up a few
[1:09:47.760 --> 1:09:51.160]  months ago when I went to Bilderberg and bullhorn that it had Richard and Haas
[1:09:51.160 --> 1:09:55.120]  come out and turn red staring at me from 20 feet away because there was one
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:58.960]  area where we could bullhorn to their main meeting hall and then women calling
[1:09:58.960 --> 1:10:02.880]  my house telling my wife is Alex there well no I'm as who is it I'll give a
[1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:05.960]  message well who is this oh I'm his wife well that's impossible we're getting
[1:10:05.960 --> 1:10:11.000]  married I'm pregnant of course I've it's totally made up I'm not out there being
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:14.960]  promiscuous it's just it's totally lie so the classic stuff and also threats
[1:10:14.960 --> 1:10:19.000]  against my family I don't even want to dignify I'm putting them out Ray McGovern
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:22.400]  you've seen all this before you've seen this in third world countries you know
[1:10:22.400 --> 1:10:26.400]  the Soviets did stuff like this the mafia does things like this your take on it
[1:10:26.400 --> 1:10:33.800]  well I think mafia is the right word the institutions of our country have been
[1:10:33.800 --> 1:10:40.400]  so corrupted that this kind of thing goes on in the FBI as it told Tom's
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:45.280]  wife it just can't do anything about it well right you know this whole business
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:52.200]  it really stinks to high heaven and Tom Feely I know he publishes my stuff
[1:10:52.200 --> 1:10:56.640]  together with other websites and he's the real deal and when he talks about
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:11:01.280]  this you can take it as you take it on faith that he's telling the truth so you
[1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:07.080]  have a rather rude interruption of his family and himself and a dire warning
[1:11:07.080 --> 1:11:12.400]  stop but publishing this stuff on your website or else couldn't be worse what
[1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:16.480]  I'm thinking about when I talk about institutions is also an institution that
[1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:22.800]  I served proudly in and the U.S. Army and what said it all to me Alex was this
[1:11:22.800 --> 1:11:28.600]  when Cy Hirsch was doing one of his exposés on what happened at Abu Ghraib
[1:11:28.600 --> 1:11:34.560]  he pointed out that General Tuguba was the only one to do an honest
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:38.960]  investigation and he did the first one you know what happened to him he ended
[1:11:38.960 --> 1:11:43.720]  up in a limousine with General Abhizid who was sent com commander at the time
[1:11:43.720 --> 1:11:48.880]  in Kuwait and they're sitting there and Abhizid turns to Tuguba and he says you
[1:11:48.880 --> 1:11:54.520]  know your your investigation is being investigated itself and you know what's
[1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:59.920]  general Tuguba so are you being investigated and Tuguba turns to see
[1:11:59.920 --> 1:12:05.080]  more Hirsch and he says it was then and only then that I realized that after
[1:12:05.080 --> 1:12:11.600]  33 years serving in this army it was no longer the U.S. Army it was the Mafia
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:15.760]  that's what we've got and we got a bunch of hoods descending upon a very
[1:12:15.760 --> 1:12:20.520]  reputable website runner and you've got that you've got the Mafia and if we
[1:12:20.520 --> 1:12:26.160]  can't yet get the FBI to investigate this with a local police I don't know
[1:12:26.160 --> 1:12:31.400]  what what we can do it sets a precedent doesn't it yeah I sure does it sets a
[1:12:31.400 --> 1:12:35.360]  precedent now we know speaking of army they're using a lot of army
[1:12:35.360 --> 1:12:40.240]  intelligence to spy on peace groups to harass people to provocateur what would
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:44.960]  you say to those men who they have twisted into doing this I mean how are
[1:12:44.960 --> 1:12:49.440]  they brainwashing them to go commit these type of crimes well you have to
[1:12:49.440 --> 1:12:53.240]  remind them what they were allegiance to and it was not the president of the
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:58.440]  United States who is the Constitution and you know some of them that will
[1:12:58.440 --> 1:13:02.080]  learn this for the first time but when they do learn it and when they know
[1:13:02.080 --> 1:13:07.680]  that there's a law against precisely this the U.S. Army is not supposed to be
[1:13:07.680 --> 1:13:13.440]  exercising domestic law enforcement functions it's against the post-economy
[1:13:13.440 --> 1:13:18.680]  taxes act much less mafia intimidation I mean assessing this a set will continue
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:22.240]  you know well I'm just suggesting that when you see one of these young folks
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:27.360]  you know out there maybe in Denver or wherever they are now you need to go up
[1:13:27.360 --> 1:13:33.240]  and I approach them and say look son or brother or you know you do realize that
[1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:38.400]  you don't have to obey unlawful orders and if you are doing domestic surveillance
[1:13:38.400 --> 1:13:42.400]  here the law says you shouldn't be doing that and just saying that you were
[1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:46.400]  ordered to do it is not going to suffice if all this is brought into a court of
[1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:52.440]  law what would Ray McGovern do if man obviously they wouldn't do it to you
[1:13:52.440 --> 1:13:55.400]  they do it to your wife or they'd assess her and see if she probably tough like
[1:13:55.400 --> 1:13:58.160]  you so wouldn't work but I mean what would you do if you walked into the
[1:13:58.160 --> 1:14:03.000]  kitchen and four guys brandish guns and said stop talking Ray McGovern shut up
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:12.880]  that's a good question I guess I'd say who are you that's what yeah and if they
[1:14:12.880 --> 1:14:18.080]  weren't able to show me identification I tell them I get get out of my house if
[1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:23.720]  they didn't do that I suppose that quickly exit the house myself lock the
[1:14:23.720 --> 1:14:29.480]  door from the outside and get get on to 9-11 or whatever it might be in hopes
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:34.160]  that they could be apprehended before they left I'm told to worry about being
[1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:38.960]  shot I think what's being shot here is the Constitution United States and they
[1:14:38.960 --> 1:14:44.200]  shot me and that had a salutary effect and an apprehending and stopping this
[1:14:44.200 --> 1:14:48.600]  kind of stuff and I would consider that was a shot worth taking well if you've
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:52.040]  got unidentified thugs in your house brandishing weapons on your wife I'm
[1:14:52.040 --> 1:14:57.320]  gonna do something else you're gonna get your own weapon yeah that's what I
[1:14:57.320 --> 1:15:00.080]  mean absolutely and I'm not looking for trouble I mean I've been around the
[1:15:00.080 --> 1:15:04.080]  block I'm not here you know acting tough it's all right I mean what do you do
[1:15:04.080 --> 1:15:08.920]  when you catch a burglar and you're safe at your house I mean yeah yeah we have
[1:15:08.920 --> 1:15:12.080]  five kids so we don't have any money and that it's very apparent from the looks
[1:15:12.080 --> 1:15:19.920]  of our house so we sure well my point is is that I'm sure they assess this guy
[1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:23.240]  as a liberal who isn't a gun owner and thought they could do it I mean I
[1:15:23.240 --> 1:15:29.400]  guarantee you that a lot of people I know they would not have gone well Ray it
[1:15:29.400 --> 1:15:35.120]  would not have gone well yeah well I mean I can't control myself I'm not like
[1:15:35.120 --> 1:15:39.080]  you Ray you know who's got all this self-control somebody comes in my house
[1:15:39.080 --> 1:15:46.480]  threatening my family I think I'd lose control yeah what would you do if your
[1:15:46.480 --> 1:15:53.840]  children were in the next room yeah well no I have to figure that out yeah I
[1:15:53.840 --> 1:15:57.720]  think I've got an idea what you do right but I think what we need to do here is
[1:15:57.720 --> 1:16:03.960]  to re-research a human cry that the whole country is sensitized to the fact
[1:16:03.960 --> 1:16:09.440]  that this can happen and you know if all is necessary is the president can call
[1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:13.600]  you an enemy combatant and they put you in jail forever those kinds of things
[1:16:13.600 --> 1:16:17.800]  really need to be highlighted American people need to be sensitized to that
[1:16:17.800 --> 1:16:22.320]  kind of situation right 20 years ago could you have ever imagined that they
[1:16:22.320 --> 1:16:26.080]  would have mafia guns running around I mean I guess it's happened before but
[1:16:26.080 --> 1:16:30.400]  at this level and again I wonder how did they get how did they assess and
[1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:37.600]  profile individuals of this low caliber to go out and threaten women yeah well
[1:16:37.600 --> 1:16:41.200]  the thing is at Alex and I think you probably appreciate this better than
[1:16:41.200 --> 1:16:47.760]  most true information is the real really the Achilles heel of this whole mafia
[1:16:47.760 --> 1:16:55.040]  crowd and Tom Feely has done yeoman service and putting out his almost
[1:16:55.040 --> 1:16:59.520]  daily publication information clearinghouse where he collects articles
[1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:04.320]  from the likes of you and me and others and it's quite an assortment if you go
[1:17:04.320 --> 1:17:08.600]  through that every day you are well informed in a way that you could never
[1:17:08.600 --> 1:17:12.240]  hope to be informed by watching TV or reading what what's left of our
[1:17:12.240 --> 1:17:15.040]  newspaper so they don't like that intelligence briefing he's provided
[1:17:15.040 --> 1:17:18.720]  no he's very dangerous he's the most dangerous of people because he's
[1:17:18.720 --> 1:17:23.880]  spreading truth around and you know that's if you spread enough truth around
[1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:27.880]  that people become educated and we've not reached that point yet but when the
[1:17:27.880 --> 1:17:32.200]  internet can be used to do this and people stop watching Fox News at night
[1:17:32.200 --> 1:17:35.600]  and just learn the few buttons they have to click to find out what's on
[1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:40.640]  information clearinghouse then this this regime is doomed and the Janie and
[1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:45.440]  Bush are on their way to the Hague to be prosecuted as war criminals which is
[1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:51.320]  what they are they've got to be desperate I mean it's it's the similar
[1:17:51.320 --> 1:17:55.240]  things have happened to me but they've got to be desperate to think that in
[1:17:55.240 --> 1:18:00.480]  threatening people's women is going to help them yeah well you know what they
[1:18:00.480 --> 1:18:06.280]  probably done is to hire some sort of private detective firm to do do the
[1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:10.920]  necessary without any strict guidelines that's what I said contractors I I
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:14.240]  assisted in the last hour is probably contractors is that what you're saying
[1:18:14.240 --> 1:18:18.320]  yeah yeah they get the contract this stuff out so that nobody's caught with
[1:18:18.320 --> 1:18:22.840]  an FBI badge in inside a house like this and you know they give them vague
[1:18:22.840 --> 1:18:28.080]  instructions to do what's necessary and then you have these kinds of threats
[1:18:28.080 --> 1:18:32.960]  against wives against children against sons and that's how this thing is played
[1:18:32.960 --> 1:18:38.440]  all you know the they told the Tom's wife that they knew where her son lived
[1:18:38.440 --> 1:18:42.400]  and how many children he has and all this kind of stuff just the worst of the
[1:18:42.400 --> 1:18:47.160]  worst it is the worst of the worst right is it make your blood boil or is it
[1:18:47.160 --> 1:18:51.960]  more I just an icy determination well it's both I'm Irish so my blood does
[1:18:51.960 --> 1:18:56.040]  boil rather quickly but I'm determined as you are you would expose this thing
[1:18:56.040 --> 1:19:00.440]  and stuff it Ray McGovern stay there we'll get into the big board what's
[1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:04.320]  happening with Iran and false-staged events on the other side stay with us

[1:23:19.120 --> 1:23:23.600]  speak out and make a big noise about this poor fellow's wife is wanting them
[1:23:23.600 --> 1:23:28.520]  to shut up that is not what you do but we'll in that discussion here
[1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:32.280]  Ray McGovern the Sy Hersh info about chaining wanting to attack a dozen
[1:23:32.280 --> 1:23:36.960]  targets a dozen provocations he would only mention one the fake patrol boats
[1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:42.440]  manufactured in u.s. naval shipyards to be peopled with a heavily armed navy
[1:23:42.440 --> 1:23:47.920]  seals and a quote shootout with larger naval vessels this is just huge yeah I
[1:23:47.920 --> 1:23:54.840]  can see them brainstorming this matter of fact it's not necessary to construct
[1:23:54.840 --> 1:24:00.580]  five PT boats in an American shipyard and somehow insinuate them into the
[1:24:00.580 --> 1:24:06.120]  Gulf the Israelis are far better at this and my my guess is that if the
[1:24:06.120 --> 1:24:11.040]  shooting war starts it will start with a provocation of that kind where Israel
[1:24:11.040 --> 1:24:16.080]  will flip a little PT boat into the Gulf painted in Iranian colors with a big
[1:24:16.080 --> 1:24:20.360]  Iranian flag and think one of our disquiet escorts and then it will be
[1:24:20.360 --> 1:24:23.600]  on that would be remote control they would claim suicide bombers were on
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:28.000]  board sure any any way they could do it that they could even fake intercepted
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:33.400]  communications it's really very very dire in that the Gulf it's chock full of
[1:24:33.400 --> 1:24:38.960]  ships and once this starts Iranians are hardly like the Iraqis who lose a lot of
[1:24:38.960 --> 1:24:43.200]  ships that a lot of men the streets will be closed will all go bankrupt it's
[1:24:43.200 --> 1:24:48.360]  really I can't I can't conceive of a stupid idea and yet if you look at the
[1:24:48.360 --> 1:24:52.640]  people are a running things and they're still chaining and Elliott Abrams the
[1:24:52.640 --> 1:24:57.240]  neocon who is responsible for so much of this the fellow in the White House was
[1:24:57.240 --> 1:25:03.320]  running on Middle East policy this is really a major threat and so a
[1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:08.120]  provocation is probably ways is going to start and you talked about full full
[1:25:08.120 --> 1:25:14.560]  flag before Alex well we know that the the president himself I'm talking about
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:22.120]  George W. Bush proposed a full flag arrangement to the British on the 31st
[1:25:22.120 --> 1:25:30.280]  of January 2003 he was getting a little bit irritated at the fact that no weapons
[1:25:30.280 --> 1:25:35.240]  of mass destruction had been found and I'm sure he realized that the
[1:25:35.240 --> 1:25:40.160]  intelligence people had to take in his wishes at that heart and that constructed
[1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:43.560]  evidence where there was no real evidence of what weapons of mass
[1:25:43.560 --> 1:25:48.440]  destruction and so he said to Tony Blair and we have this in a British
[1:25:48.440 --> 1:25:53.240]  memocon I mean you know the British have not disavowed this he said to Tony
[1:25:53.240 --> 1:26:00.120]  Blair three way three things we could do now one would be to paint a U2 a U2
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:06.040]  spy plane with U.N. colors and fly it over you know over the board a well-passed
[1:26:06.040 --> 1:26:12.720]  the no-fly zone and have Sotomayor St. takes some shots at it and that would be
[1:26:12.720 --> 1:26:18.040]  recent for war you know that's what we can do well there's a full flag operation
[1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:22.520]  it never got off the ground but the other two things he had in mind were you
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:27.000]  know finding in quotes a defector who would talk about all these weapons of
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:32.640]  mass destruction and the other one was simply assassinating Hussein so you
[1:26:32.640 --> 1:26:37.120]  know it's not surprising at all that the vice president in particular would be
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:42.640]  talking about a dozen such schemes the more so since we also know that there
[1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:47.840]  was a plan to insert a bunch of the Rockies into one part of Iraq of Iraq
[1:26:47.840 --> 1:26:53.320]  before the war have them shoot up some folks in some police stations have the
[1:26:53.320 --> 1:27:00.800]  Iraqi army come in and try to do battle with them they will meanwhile have to
[1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:06.720]  clarity free Iraq and north-western Iraq and we would come to their defense that
[1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:12.240]  was another sort of false flag or or provocation that was planned that didn't
[1:27:12.240 --> 1:27:17.320]  get off the ground either so these folks think in mafia terms they think of the
[1:27:17.320 --> 1:27:23.360]  same terms you know this sounds hard but it's just factual this is exactly what
[1:27:23.360 --> 1:27:28.400]  Hitler did before invading Poland you know the story about dressing up some
[1:27:28.400 --> 1:27:33.880]  stormtroopers and Polish uniforms why what's yeah for having them you shoot up
[1:27:33.880 --> 1:27:38.200]  a radio station where it all was and that was the causes belly then and you
[1:27:38.200 --> 1:27:43.640]  know what Alex the worst thing is most Germans believed most Germans wanted to
[1:27:43.640 --> 1:27:47.480]  believe what it was saying what was necessary why because Poland was a
[1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:52.120]  threat now you know that's as far-fetched as saying Iran is a threat to the
[1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:56.000]  United States well it just came out two days ago in mainstream news but got
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:00.680]  almost no attention these incredible things come out that Cheney ordered the
[1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:07.760]  CIA to create fake weapons information on Iraq you know that's how to run
[1:28:07.760 --> 1:28:14.800]  Susskind's book and that run run is as well plugged in in Washington as I
[1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:20.480]  heard from that saying a lot Iran's already written two books one on one on
[1:28:20.480 --> 1:28:25.800]  the Secretary of the Treasury Walsh's or O'Neill was his name
[1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:31.800]  Paul O'Neill his experiences treasury and then the other one was the 1%
[1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:36.920]  doctrine how does Cheney come at the world stay there quick break long

[1:31:11.960 --> 1:31:17.360]  at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally
[1:31:17.360 --> 1:31:24.880]  gives first responders a platform to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the
[1:31:24.880 --> 1:31:30.920]  18 made a statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows the
[1:31:30.920 --> 1:31:35.420]  growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action
[1:31:35.420 --> 1:31:39.200]  against their global masters. He had his hand over the radio while he was
[1:31:39.200 --> 1:31:43.320]  getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear three two one and it was
[1:31:43.320 --> 1:31:48.360]  boom boom boom boom boom. This is an emergency transmission worldwide
[1:31:48.360 --> 1:31:54.160]  download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it
[1:31:54.160 --> 1:31:59.280]  worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com. If we don't expose the government
[1:31:59.280 --> 1:32:15.200]  sponsored terror they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:32:15.200 --> 1:32:18.240]  I want to be clear I'm not looking for a fight here when the government's not
[1:32:18.240 --> 1:32:23.400]  looking for a fight. Secret police goons thugs army intelligence hired
[1:32:23.400 --> 1:32:28.600]  mercenaries LA times with photos of people dressed in black water
[1:32:28.600 --> 1:32:32.920]  uniforms rating miracle medical marijuana facilities black water
[1:32:32.920 --> 1:32:39.640]  confiscating guns in New Orleans and now documented on PBS of all places Israeli
[1:32:39.640 --> 1:32:44.560]  commandos were used according to PBS and a new special bill mortars came out of
[1:32:44.560 --> 1:32:48.200]  retirement to do running around gun confiscating I mean you can't make this
[1:32:48.200 --> 1:32:53.720]  stuff up hiring former Latin American death squads to be used in Iraq hiring
[1:32:53.720 --> 1:32:57.880]  aggravated felons for the military I mean these are all the classic things
[1:32:57.880 --> 1:33:03.040]  that Hitler and Stalin and every other thug did and I want to get into the
[1:33:03.040 --> 1:33:06.000]  latest developments with Iran with Ray McGovern and then take your calls and
[1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:09.120]  talk about whatever subjects he thinks are most important I've been kind of
[1:33:09.120 --> 1:33:12.760]  dominating discussion here or at least the points that are being brought up but
[1:33:12.760 --> 1:33:17.960]  getting back to the police state Ray I just in my heart of hearts know that the
[1:33:17.960 --> 1:33:21.560]  American people are still good enough and not so distracted by mainstream
[1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:25.440]  television and media that's there to put him to sleep to realize this is
[1:33:25.440 --> 1:33:29.360]  classical tyranny but but sometimes even knowing as much as I know about the
[1:33:29.360 --> 1:33:35.320]  world and studying this 16 17 hours a day I find it kind of just overwhelming
[1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:41.000]  sometimes almost like sticker shock by the level of the tyranny where it's
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:44.640]  hard for me to believe this is happening but it really is do you ever know
[1:33:44.640 --> 1:33:48.680]  studying other countries and other tyrannies does it ever just hit you and
[1:33:48.680 --> 1:33:53.840]  shock you well it does indeed you know I watch the Soviet Union for 30 years and
[1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:59.600]  a lot of this stuff is including the propaganda Alex it's exactly what I saw
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:05.480]  doing that watching the Soviet Union you know the biggest sea change that I've
[1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:10.240]  observed in my 45 years in Washington is the fact that we no longer have any
[1:34:10.240 --> 1:34:15.960]  real sense a free media and that's big that is very big we no longer have the
[1:34:15.960 --> 1:34:20.240]  kind of press or media that we had it during Watergate or during Vietnam or
[1:34:20.240 --> 1:34:27.080]  or since and this makes it all the more urgent for people like you and me to
[1:34:27.080 --> 1:34:31.000]  find ways to push the word out because the American people it's a pride of all
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:36.480]  this how many how many newspapers are gonna are going to run the story on
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:40.080]  Tom Feely tomorrow you know maybe one maybe a
[1:34:40.080 --> 1:34:45.080]  McClatchy little report will but if you read the newspapers you don't get it if
[1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:50.080]  you watch television you don't get it if you listen to present planet other
[1:34:50.080 --> 1:34:56.240]  other places like this or you read the Tom Feely's reps website then you do get
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:35:00.840]  it the only problem is how do we get enough people sensitized to the fact
[1:35:00.840 --> 1:35:05.880]  that if you have a computer it's real real simple to spend 15 minutes a day
[1:35:05.880 --> 1:35:10.960]  pressing a couple of buttons so that you get informed and I think you know once
[1:35:10.960 --> 1:35:16.560]  neighbors start getting wrapped up as Tom or his wife almost was yesterday or
[1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:23.640]  we'll get around and people will seek ways to become informed is it a good
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:28.680]  indicator I'm making lemonade out of lemons here that they are having to
[1:35:28.680 --> 1:35:33.600]  resort to these type of tactics with a lot of other writers and people I know
[1:35:33.600 --> 1:35:37.000]  that continues steadfastly but don't want to talk about the things that have
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:41.200]  happened I mean to me it's horrible this is happening but they wouldn't be doing
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:47.080]  as if we weren't hurting them well that gets back to our point before the one
[1:35:47.080 --> 1:35:50.640]  we were both making and that is that the truth is what's going to get these guys
[1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:56.080]  the truth very literally is the Bible says is what will keep us free so once
[1:35:56.080 --> 1:36:02.000]  you get a fellow like Tom Feely and you know Feely is fearless you know he'll
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:06.800]  publish this story about Cheney he'll publish anything that makes sense and
[1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:12.440]  can be documented and that is very very fearful for for the people who are in
[1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:17.840]  this country because the one thing the mafia doesn't need is exposure I've
[1:36:17.840 --> 1:36:20.720]  talked to a lot of other analysts but I want to get your expert take on this
[1:36:20.720 --> 1:36:26.000]  that the establishment is fighting the 1960s or 1950s war with that technology
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:30.040]  and that they thought they were secure because they bought up all the mainstream
[1:36:30.040 --> 1:36:34.560]  media and it consolidated that and that they kind of just poo pooed the power of
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:39.000]  the alternative press but now they had underestimated its power they're just
[1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:42.920]  now starting to realize its power and by then the genies out of the bottle I
[1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:48.560]  mean the information we're bringing out here is becoming a larger and larger
[1:36:48.560 --> 1:36:54.120]  minority beginning to verge on majority and that they're playing four or five
[1:36:54.120 --> 1:36:58.320]  steps behind well I think that's part of it and I think that's why they want to
[1:36:58.320 --> 1:37:04.160]  make this sort of an object object lesson that look you continue this kind of
[1:37:04.160 --> 1:37:08.560]  thing you can end up like mrs. Feely or like Tom and and have your place
[1:37:08.560 --> 1:37:13.840]  invaded by some contract quasi-cuppers and they'll have the guns under their
[1:37:13.840 --> 1:37:18.360]  lapels and they'll threaten the heck out of you and so be scared be scared don't
[1:37:18.360 --> 1:37:23.280]  don't think you can do this with impunity I do think it's a good
[1:37:23.280 --> 1:37:27.880]  education of how defensive they are and how much they want to intimidate
[1:37:27.880 --> 1:37:33.320]  people from spreading truth around now let's having the opposite effect and
[1:37:33.320 --> 1:37:37.560]  that's what concerns me I don't have the illusion that the elite is invincible
[1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:41.080]  and that has all the answers and never makes mistakes that so much of the
[1:37:41.080 --> 1:37:44.800]  public you know tends to think that but really you've worked in and around these
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:47.840]  people before it was this corrupt you know they're just people as well and
[1:37:47.840 --> 1:37:51.720]  that's what's even more scary in a way it would be more assuring if they knew
[1:37:51.720 --> 1:37:55.640]  what they were doing and didn't make mistakes and you know we're evil but
[1:37:55.640 --> 1:37:59.680]  at least somehow we're in control I mean that's just a basic psychology there
[1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:03.880]  it's bad but it's not as bad as they think they're in control but they're not
[1:38:03.880 --> 1:38:09.120]  it seems like as you degrade a military in an intelligence network and turn the
[1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:12.800]  cold war apparatus on the people that the good guys are going to leave and say
[1:38:12.800 --> 1:38:16.080]  no and start fighting you like you and so many others and people I know that
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:19.520]  intelligence are retired who aren't public you know they're all shaking their
[1:38:19.520 --> 1:38:22.800]  heads for years seeing what's happening so it seems to me like it's a brain
[1:38:22.800 --> 1:38:27.200]  drain they don't have that many quality people anymore and all they've got is a
[1:38:27.200 --> 1:38:31.520]  bunch of thugs well that's right and that's why you have people like my
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:35.920]  former colleagues in the CIA we're coming out now and telling people like
[1:38:35.920 --> 1:38:41.040]  Ron Suskind who wrote this book about what they were asked to do earlier on
[1:38:41.040 --> 1:38:49.520]  how they were asked to forge and I get this to forge a letter which purported
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:55.200]  to show that Mohammed Atta who you know led the hijackers that he did his
[1:38:55.200 --> 1:39:01.320]  training in Iraq in other words Cheney very much wanted to prove that Iraq was
[1:39:01.320 --> 1:39:06.200]  responsible for 9-11 or at least to train the people who did 9-11 okay that
[1:39:06.200 --> 1:39:11.000]  the link between Hussein and 9-11 was one of the things that's all the war let's
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:15.400]  face it they even tried to connect the Hussein with the anthrax stuff it's very
[1:39:15.400 --> 1:39:21.000]  very clear it was all scare tactic now when you have Cheney doing these kinds
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:25.720]  of things it's really incumbent upon the rest of us to expose them and my
[1:39:25.720 --> 1:39:30.560]  friends in the CIA have exposed that now what will happen well Suskind's book
[1:39:30.560 --> 1:39:34.680]  hasn't got much play at all in the mainstream media so far but if we keep
[1:39:34.680 --> 1:39:38.520]  pressing you know we say you know it's not quite right to have a letter that
[1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:45.920]  that is backdated to 2001 okay before the 9-11 which says that the Hussein and
[1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:50.600]  his Iraqi friends were training Mohammed Atta it's not quite right to have that
[1:39:50.600 --> 1:39:55.960]  surface in the Western press after it had been port forged by the CIA
[1:39:55.960 --> 1:40:00.960]  matter of fact it's not only not quite right it's illegal the CIA is barred by
[1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:06.400]  law from the concocting things like that designed to influence public opinion in
[1:40:06.400 --> 1:40:12.880]  this country so what one has to do is get George Tenet the head of the CIA at the
[1:40:12.880 --> 1:40:18.760]  time on the stand he has already perjured himself once and I've noted
[1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:26.040]  that in an article I wrote and very briefly it's during the 9-11 commission
[1:40:26.040 --> 1:40:31.880]  proceedings he having had this agreement with the president for a long time
[1:40:31.880 --> 1:40:36.560]  that he would not embarrass the president by telling the world how many
[1:40:36.560 --> 1:40:40.680]  times he had won the president about 9-11 and in return for that the
[1:40:40.680 --> 1:40:45.360]  president would you know praise him up and down not not can him and you know
[1:40:45.360 --> 1:40:49.040]  eventually give him the highest of civilian metal that he could give now
[1:40:49.040 --> 1:40:52.760]  George Tenet was pledged to defend the president so when he was asked before
[1:40:52.760 --> 1:40:58.760]  the 9-11 commission after his sworn sworn in he's speaking under oath you know
[1:40:58.760 --> 1:41:03.280]  what did you say to the president during October you know before I'm not October
[1:41:03.280 --> 1:41:08.120]  but before in August before September 11th so I never talked to the president
[1:41:08.120 --> 1:41:12.680]  and the Romer one of the commissioners said you you never talked to the
[1:41:12.680 --> 1:41:17.120]  president no I never saw the president he was in he was in Crawford and you know
[1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:21.600]  I took some leave around here are you sure yeah I'm sure well that evening
[1:41:21.600 --> 1:41:28.680]  tenet spokesman wrote a little note to the 9-11 Commission oh the head of the
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:36.560]  CIA George Tenet misspoke he did see the president on the 14th of August and
[1:41:36.560 --> 1:41:41.760]  he saw him at the end of August too and we've since found out that he saw him
[1:41:41.760 --> 1:41:46.560]  one time in between there in Crawford two times in Crawford one time when
[1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:51.920]  we finally got back to Washington on 31st of August so with that that was a
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:56.760]  lie under oath you know it's not likely that the tenet forgot about that because
[1:41:56.760 --> 1:42:02.040]  he waxes eloquent about that visit to Crawford and how he marveled at the fauna
[1:42:02.040 --> 1:42:06.280]  and the flora and how George Bush took him around in his Jeep and all this stuff
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:10.120]  you know he said that my first time in Crawford and you know this boy from
[1:42:10.120 --> 1:42:13.360]  Queens man that was really I mean it's incredible that he would have forgotten
[1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:17.200]  that so he purchased himself under oath well it was all over TV when he was
[1:42:17.200 --> 1:42:20.720]  there was all over the news now now you just said something and again so much
[1:42:20.720 --> 1:42:25.120]  is happening I miss a lot of things and I read the mainstream news reports the
[1:42:25.120 --> 1:42:30.360]  blurbs that came out and I mentioned MSNBC of the CIA being ordered to
[1:42:30.360 --> 1:42:37.680]  manufacture connections to Iraq and and 9-11 but but are you saying that the
[1:42:37.680 --> 1:42:41.160]  that Bush and see how I'm embarrassed I missed this or did I hear you correctly
[1:42:41.160 --> 1:42:48.280]  that Bush was ordering the Cheney was ordering the CIA to create fake
[1:42:48.280 --> 1:42:55.360]  connections to Muhammad Anna before 9-11 to Iraq that is smoking gun no I
[1:42:55.360 --> 1:43:02.200]  didn't mean to say that I'm saying that before 9-11 George Bush was was so
[1:43:02.200 --> 1:43:07.400]  thoroughly briefed by George Tenet that when the balloon went up you know at 9
[1:43:07.400 --> 1:43:13.040]  11 George Bush's face for the very difficult decision here is George
[1:43:13.040 --> 1:43:17.920]  Tenet with like 36 serious warnings that he issued to the president over the
[1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:22.960]  last six weeks and he has the goods on him and so there had to be a deal so
[1:43:22.960 --> 1:43:26.440]  Bush went out to the CIA you may remember this he went out yes we kept
[1:43:26.440 --> 1:43:32.600]  him and he said George George Tenet is the best DCI we have the CIA is keep
[1:43:32.600 --> 1:43:37.560]  his kept us safe and that we have the best intelligence service in the world
[1:43:37.560 --> 1:43:44.280]  in return for which in return for which George Tenet pledged that he would not
[1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:50.240]  make available to the general public or even the 9-11 Commission the number of
[1:43:50.240 --> 1:43:54.360]  times that he had born president you know yeah but I'm determined to attack
[1:43:54.360 --> 1:43:57.960]  memos all those lies now and then rice was caught lying under oath about that
[1:43:57.960 --> 1:44:03.840]  as well expanding on that it just came out ABC News two days ago and a bunch of
[1:44:03.840 --> 1:44:10.160]  other places it was reported that the White House ordered the FBI Director
[1:44:10.160 --> 1:44:16.520]  Mueller to lie and say that the anthrax came from Iraq when they knew it was US
[1:44:16.520 --> 1:44:20.040]  government weaponized from the start of that so comment on that mr. McGovern and
[1:44:20.040 --> 1:44:26.320]  then give us your take on the this latest apparent patsy dying in government
[1:44:26.320 --> 1:44:34.000]  custody and the lady who's all these DWIs and drugs and and then putting out this
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:37.560]  info that he was the man the FBI saying he was the only suspect the whole time
[1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:41.080]  while they were persecuting Steven Hatfield in the White House on Cipro
[1:44:41.080 --> 1:44:46.640]  I mean to simplify that a your take on the White House ordering the CIA to try
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:50.200]  to come up with something that that Saddam had this anthrax and then B what's
[1:44:50.200 --> 1:44:56.200]  your take on the anthrax on the anthrax thing you know it's not surprising but
[1:44:56.200 --> 1:45:00.880]  it's no no less infuriating what happened of course was the White House
[1:45:00.880 --> 1:45:07.160]  instructed people like Tom Brokaw and others to I'm sorry that has to do with
[1:45:07.160 --> 1:45:13.840]  the other one what they did was instruct people to tie the anthrax to Iraq
[1:45:13.840 --> 1:45:21.440]  there's absolutely no no evidence of that at all and yet people did tie it to
[1:45:21.440 --> 1:45:25.640]  Iraq and that was one of the most fearful things that Cheney was able to
[1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:31.760]  play on to justify and quotes on the attack on Iraq with the White House do
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:35.480]  this of course they were they've done well manner of surreptitious and the
[1:45:35.480 --> 1:45:40.360]  illegal things and the mainstream media as I mentioned before was all too eager
[1:45:40.360 --> 1:45:45.680]  to play the game so the anthrax also became directly associated with Iraq
[1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:51.000]  because the White House said told their favorite people in the media without any
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:55.840]  evidence at all that it looked like Iraq might have been behind that as well so
[1:45:55.840 --> 1:46:03.280]  you know even now who is it that fellow that's on late at night fellow with the
[1:46:03.280 --> 1:46:09.440]  10 major questions or 10 major oh it came from there was a name now but yeah
[1:46:09.440 --> 1:46:13.440]  he had to interviewed McCain okay it'll come to me a second he interviewed
[1:46:13.440 --> 1:46:17.240]  McCain a week or so and it came to you know there are evidence there's
[1:46:17.240 --> 1:46:21.920]  evidence that the rock is behind this and if that's sitting behind I'm saying
[1:46:21.920 --> 1:46:28.680]  behind the anthrax Obermann and now it was the it was that fellow Letterman
[1:46:28.680 --> 1:46:32.240]  Letterman oh yeah Letterman sure yeah he had Letterman on there and there it's on
[1:46:32.240 --> 1:46:37.160]  the web you can not seen it's great yeah where it were McCain quite gratuitously
[1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:42.800]  says you know this information that you rock you rock was involved in this and
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:46.880]  you know if that's the truth we'll have to put an end to that right away you know
[1:46:46.880 --> 1:46:55.520]  stuff so yeah it was one of these what we call propaganda offenses and there
[1:46:55.520 --> 1:47:00.560]  were people in the CIA who were seconded to the White House to make sure they
[1:47:00.560 --> 1:47:08.520]  knew how to do over propaganda correctly it's amazing and and and the the American
[1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:13.240]  people still have no idea that it's not just lies about WMD's it's it's all of
[1:47:13.240 --> 1:47:17.320]  the fake documents in the manufacturing I mean specifically on the anthrax so the
[1:47:17.320 --> 1:47:21.200]  White House is on the drug that fights it four weeks before the anthrax shows up
[1:47:21.200 --> 1:47:25.240]  we have all these enemies the White House being sent the anthrax it's super
[1:47:25.240 --> 1:47:29.240]  weaponized from Fort Dietrich the FBI claims somebody made it in a basement
[1:47:29.240 --> 1:47:33.360]  with a bucket I mean what's your bottom line and assessment of who's behind the
[1:47:33.360 --> 1:47:39.720]  anthrax attack well clearly it was a government worker because the strain
[1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:43.080]  that was developed was far too sophisticated to come from any case
[1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:48.680]  any cave in Afghanistan or or Pakistan or any other place that's what I mean then
[1:47:48.680 --> 1:47:52.720]  we have the White House running around saying it's it's Iraq and then they're
[1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:56.360]  on Cipro I mean that's that's enough to indict somebody right there I mean I
[1:47:56.360 --> 1:48:01.200]  mean aren't the White House the prime suspects? It should be. Well it's a leap
[1:48:01.200 --> 1:48:04.840]  that I'm not quite prepared to make right now what we know it came in what we
[1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:09.360]  know is it came from the US government lab I haven't had a time to read all the
[1:48:09.360 --> 1:48:14.280]  reporting on this follow that they wrapped up it stinks to high heaven as we
[1:48:14.280 --> 1:48:20.320]  would say in the Bronx but it seems to me equally likely at least that the
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:24.680]  White House seized on this and tried to associate it with Iraq right away which
[1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:28.720]  of course they did rather than plot the whole thing but you know we really have
[1:48:28.720 --> 1:48:31.640]  to get to the bottom of it but the thought that this guy acted alone is a
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:37.240]  little bit stretchy for me stretches my credulity. Israel moles military
[1:48:37.240 --> 1:48:41.760]  option for Iran strikes and I keep seeing the similar headline Israel's
[1:48:41.760 --> 1:48:44.760]  got to get their nukes got to get their nukes and the average American hears
[1:48:44.760 --> 1:48:47.200]  that in the back of the you know they're in the bar and they hear it on the TV
[1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:51.280]  they're thinking they've got nukes with that misleading headline and and the
[1:48:51.280 --> 1:48:55.320]  war drums are going um... what's the word now are they still planning to hit
[1:48:55.320 --> 1:49:00.480]  Iran? Well of course what Americans don't know is you suggest that Iran doesn't
[1:49:00.480 --> 1:49:06.560]  have any nukes and won't have any nukes for a couple years yet if then. 16 US
[1:49:06.560 --> 1:49:11.800]  intelligence agencies have pronounced in a formal document unanimously that the
[1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:17.600]  Iran stopped its nuclear weapons related program not the
[1:49:17.600 --> 1:49:24.720]  enrichment of uranium but the nuclear weapons related aspects in mid 2003 and
[1:49:24.720 --> 1:49:29.000]  that as of this time last year they had not reestablished it so when the
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:33.160]  president vice president other people say or talk of lively about Iranian nukes
[1:49:33.160 --> 1:49:37.520]  number one there aren't any and number two our best intelligence is that they
[1:49:37.520 --> 1:49:41.960]  stopped working on nuclear related on nuclear weapons related stuff that's
[1:49:41.960 --> 1:49:47.960]  really important uh... there's plenty more here uh... the situation in Iraq is
[1:49:47.960 --> 1:49:51.960]  specifically related to this and if we have a little bit more time I like how
[1:49:51.960 --> 1:49:54.600]  they go. Yes sir let's cover that when we get back and then take a few phone
[1:49:54.600 --> 1:49:57.960]  calls with Ray McGovern he's an amazing individual we really appreciate him
[1:49:57.960 --> 1:50:08.960]  spending so much time with us today. It is a big idea a new world order. In the
[1:50:08.960 --> 1:50:15.320]  near future earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the
[1:50:15.320 --> 1:50:20.760]  Bilderberg group but their objective being world domination. For thousands of
[1:50:20.760 --> 1:50:25.760]  years their dark order grew now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:34.240]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time
[1:50:34.240 --> 1:50:39.240]  in history the elites plan for world government is blown wide open. You will
[1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:43.400]  learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda. Bilderberg is
[1:50:43.400 --> 1:50:46.360]  making great progress for the world government. Most people have no idea

[1:53:10.200 --> 1:53:15.120]  Ray McGovern's gonna stay with us 20 minutes into the next hour for John
[1:53:15.120 --> 1:53:17.920]  Kurt, Alan, and many others holding to talk to him, told free number to join us.
[1:53:17.920 --> 1:53:26.520]  800-259-9231. We're going into Iraq, Iran, other two areas he wants to discuss and
[1:53:26.520 --> 1:53:30.040]  then of course your phone calls. Before we go back to Ray McGovern I want to
[1:53:30.040 --> 1:53:33.760]  encourage all of you to support the alternative media. Get my film Terror
[1:53:33.760 --> 1:53:37.880]  Storm, a history of government-sponsored terrorism. It covers how our own
[1:53:37.880 --> 1:53:41.120]  government overthrew Iran by staging terror attacks, Operation Ajax, it
[1:53:41.120 --> 1:53:44.040]  covers the U.S. and celebrity attack with Israel trying to sink the ship to
[1:53:44.040 --> 1:53:49.120]  blame it on Egypt. That's now been declassified by the NSA. Boy that shut
[1:53:49.120 --> 1:53:53.160]  up the debunkers real fast. So it covers a bunch of declassified histories of that
[1:53:53.160 --> 1:53:58.920]  and then we get into 9-11-777 and what happened there, Terror Storm, the final
[1:53:58.920 --> 1:54:02.920]  cut. It's a second edition, it's the final edition. It's in the BBC announcing
[1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:07.200]  building 7 falling 25 minutes before it did exactly as it did fall. Firefighters
[1:54:07.200 --> 1:54:10.120]  police on video saying get back they're about to blow it up. I mean it's
[1:54:10.120 --> 1:54:15.280]  powerful. It is Terror Storm final cut. It's got Governor Jesse Ventura in it and
[1:54:15.280 --> 1:54:18.880]  many others. My new film is Truth Rising about the 9-11 Truth Movement. It's
[1:54:18.880 --> 1:54:23.680]  available as cheap as 9.95 at info wars.com. Get my films, make copies of
[1:54:23.680 --> 1:54:26.840]  them, give them to people. If you take action you are unstoppable. We are
[1:54:26.840 --> 1:54:30.680]  unstoppable together and as the tyranny intensifies you better understand folks.
[1:54:30.680 --> 1:54:35.240]  This is life and death and before we get into Iran and Iraq, Ray McGovern, I wanted
[1:54:35.240 --> 1:54:40.880]  to bring that point up to you and that's this. I don't think people working for
[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:44.400]  the establishment compartmentalized who you know we're carrying out one piece of
[1:54:44.400 --> 1:54:47.520]  evil and another piece of evil and they're all combined together. I don't
[1:54:47.520 --> 1:54:50.600]  think they understand you know it's all a big fun thing. They're in charge, they're
[1:54:50.600 --> 1:54:53.440]  tough, they're intimidating women and children, they're threatening people,
[1:54:53.440 --> 1:54:56.200]  they're spying on people. I don't think they know history and that
[1:54:56.200 --> 1:55:00.080]  tyrannies are for the general public. You know they want to shut down the
[1:55:00.080 --> 1:55:03.680]  opposition but once the tyranny is in place it's because they want to loot
[1:55:03.680 --> 1:55:09.320]  economies, rob the population, destroy the treasury. That's what this is about
[1:55:09.320 --> 1:55:12.720]  and can you just historically briefly, as we have more time with you before we
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:17.560]  get into Iraq in the next segment, speak to what's happening you know
[1:55:17.560 --> 1:55:24.080]  historically with how a tyranny will affect us all? Well the most important
[1:55:24.080 --> 1:55:31.800]  thing for me is how with the withdrawal of Habeas Corpus with the recent ruling
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:36.600]  from the U.S. Circuit Court, the 4th District, with other things that the
[1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:43.920]  president has said he can do, our government can say all right Alex, the
[1:55:43.920 --> 1:55:49.080]  president has named you a enemy combatant. Pick you up from your studio and
[1:55:49.080 --> 1:55:53.560]  take you to some cell in South Carolina, keep you there for the rest of your
[1:55:53.560 --> 1:55:59.280]  life. That's possible, that's possible under the Patriot Act and as I said
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:04.240]  I just been reinforced not only by the court decision I just mentioned but by
[1:56:04.240 --> 1:56:09.680]  what we can call now the Hamden principle where that's chauffeur for
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:15.600]  bin Laden, you know okay, no material support for terrorism and yet he's you
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:19.760]  know he's been convicted of this and can be put in that well we'll be kept for
[1:56:19.760 --> 1:56:24.800]  life. So these principles have been established now nobody said much in
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:31.200]  our courts and the Congress of course is completely pointed on all of this. The
[1:56:31.200 --> 1:56:36.320]  only hopeful sign that I see well is there are really two. One is the group
[1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:42.240]  of intelligence analysts who had the guts to speak out at the end of 2007 and
[1:56:42.240 --> 1:56:51.400]  say hey guess what actually it was 2000 yeah. Anyhow the November estimate
[1:56:51.400 --> 1:56:55.640]  which said you know what I'm telling you about Iran and nuclear weapons well
[1:56:55.640 --> 1:57:01.120]  they stopped their program in mid-2003 and haven't restarted it. That's big
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:04.840]  because the president didn't want to hear that, Cheney didn't want to hear that.
[1:57:04.840 --> 1:57:10.760]  Guess why it was that that got out into the news. It got out into news because
[1:57:10.760 --> 1:57:15.240]  our professional military. I'm thinking about Mo Fallon who has since been
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:20.080]  here sheared but I'm also thinking about the current chairman of Joint Chiefs
[1:57:20.080 --> 1:57:25.320]  of Staff Mike Mullin insisted that it be put out there. Besides Congress had been
[1:57:25.320 --> 1:57:29.440]  given early copies and they were gonna put it out and the administration didn't.
[1:57:29.440 --> 1:57:33.600]  So there's a really hopeful development. There's still some honest people in our
[1:57:33.600 --> 1:57:37.120]  government trying to tell the truth even though it cuts of course the green of
[1:57:37.120 --> 1:57:41.560]  what the government wants to do. Absolutely we got good people everywhere.
[1:57:41.560 --> 1:57:54.360]  The government will be back in 60 seconds.
[1:57:54.360 --> 1:58:02.360]  May I have everyone's attention please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:58:02.360 --> 1:58:05.160]  Do you like being a puppet sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:58:05.160 --> 1:58:09.120]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state? It was engineered by you,
[1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:13.320]  David Rockefeller, that's for a lateral commission to see it for our own good.
[1:58:13.320 --> 1:58:18.800]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of
[1:58:18.800 --> 1:58:23.200]  just criticism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of
[1:58:23.200 --> 1:58:30.920]  September 11th, a global awakening has taken place. An inside job. How dare you?
[1:58:30.920 --> 1:58:36.720]  If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for
[1:58:36.720 --> 1:58:45.720]  treason yourself. If the government has not told the truth in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[1:58:45.720 --> 1:58:51.720]  Please rise, download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:58:51.720 --> 1:58:56.720]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:58:56.720 --> 1:59:08.720]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:59:08.720 --> 1:59:16.720]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[1:59:16.720 --> 1:59:25.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:59:25.720 --> 1:59:30.720]  Ray McGovern is our guest for another 20 minutes, long 14-minute segment coming up.
[1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:34.720]  We're going to talk to the callers after this break coming up in five minutes.
[1:59:34.720 --> 1:59:40.720]  I forgot to add that in Terror Storm, Ray McGovern, interviewing him in there about the very intelligence
[1:59:40.720 --> 1:59:46.720]  report about no WMDs and no nuclear program abandoned in 2003. That is, by the way, in Terror Storm.
[1:59:46.720 --> 1:59:51.720]  He's also in the upcoming film. Jason Burma is interviewing for it, Fabled Enemies.
[1:59:51.720 --> 1:59:55.720]  Where we look at the Israelis infiltrating our government.
[1:59:55.720 --> 2:00:02.720]  We're not here to bash Israel. It's just a fact that Israel is extremely war-like and manipulating
[2:00:02.720 --> 2:00:06.720]  much of our foreign policy. Before Ray leaves, maybe we can talk about that.
[2:00:06.720 --> 2:00:10.720]  Speaking of the devil, it's Israel driving the Iran showdown and what's happening in Iraq.
[2:00:10.720 --> 2:00:15.720]  You were wanting to mention earlier the situation in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[2:00:15.720 --> 2:00:20.720]  Now more US troops being killed every week in Afghanistan than in Iraq. Ray McGovern.
[2:00:20.720 --> 2:00:28.720]  Well, Alex, the basis of the problem really is that our leaders back seven years ago or
[2:00:28.720 --> 2:00:35.720]  eight years ago, including our military leaders, had no concept, had no lessons learned from
[2:00:35.720 --> 2:00:41.720]  the experience of Vietnam. And that, very simply, is you don't go invading another country
[2:00:41.720 --> 2:00:46.720]  and think you can occupy it and bend them to your will without having the kind of insurgency
[2:00:46.720 --> 2:00:51.720]  that is sure to defeat you. I mean, it happened to the British, it happened to the French,
[2:00:51.720 --> 2:00:57.720]  and it happened to us in Vietnam. And a mere 30 years goes by. Everybody forgets that.
[2:00:57.720 --> 2:01:01.720]  The military is not even trained to do counterinsurgency anymore, and they go into Iraq.
[2:01:01.720 --> 2:01:06.720]  And what they expected in terms of the reaction of Iraqi people, I don't know,
[2:01:06.720 --> 2:01:11.720]  but they were really terribly naive if they could make this thing work.
[2:01:11.720 --> 2:01:16.720]  Now, people have to realize that it wasn't weapons of mass destruction clearly.
[2:01:16.720 --> 2:01:20.720]  It wasn't ties between Iraq and al-Qaeda clearly. What was it?
[2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:26.720]  Well, I've been thinking for five years now, it was an acronym OIL. OK, O for oil,
[2:01:26.720 --> 2:01:32.720]  I for Israel, and L for logistics, the permanent military bases that would be set up there
[2:01:32.720 --> 2:01:37.720]  that the US could use to dominate that area, take care of the oil, and take care of Israel.
[2:01:37.720 --> 2:01:43.720]  Now, what happened? Well, there were no terrorists to speak of in Iraq before.
[2:01:43.720 --> 2:01:49.720]  Now there are. It's teeming with terrorists. And is Israel safer? Of course not.
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:53.720]  Will Israel be safe if the US troops leave? Of course not.
[2:01:53.720 --> 2:01:59.720]  So it's very, very much in Israel's interest to have us embedded, so to speak,
[2:01:59.720 --> 2:02:03.720]  in the Middle East for a very long time to come. How best to do that?
[2:02:03.720 --> 2:02:07.720]  Well, the best way, of course, would be to get us involved in a war with Iran.
[2:02:07.720 --> 2:02:11.720]  Then we would be there for the duration, then there would be a draft year,
[2:02:11.720 --> 2:02:15.720]  then we'd have all kinds of folks, all kinds of casualties, and it would be very easy
[2:02:15.720 --> 2:02:21.720]  to start up American, quote, patriotism, end quote, to support a wider war.
[2:02:21.720 --> 2:02:26.720]  And besides all that, of course, as the Israelis look at it, they've only got five months.
[2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:29.720]  I mean, Bush and Cheney are going to be gone.
[2:02:29.720 --> 2:02:35.720]  And they've made it very explicit that the president has promised to take care of Iraq
[2:02:35.720 --> 2:02:39.720]  as they put it before he leaves office. So they have this window of five months.
[2:02:39.720 --> 2:02:46.720]  And if I were in that kind of frame of mind by the Israeli leaders, which I'm not, of course,
[2:02:46.720 --> 2:02:50.720]  but the way they look at the world and the way they look at their history,
[2:02:50.720 --> 2:02:55.720]  what has worked in the past is you provoke something. You provoke something to make a wider war.
[2:02:55.720 --> 2:03:00.720]  This is bound and determined under Bush, at least, to come to Israel's aid.
[2:03:00.720 --> 2:03:05.720]  And we've got a major war going where most of Iran's nuclear facilities,
[2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:08.720]  whether the weapons related or not, will be destroyed.
[2:03:08.720 --> 2:03:11.720]  And that'll be nice. That'll be, you know, give them another 10 years.
[2:03:11.720 --> 2:03:15.720]  It's a terribly myopic policy that Israel is following
[2:03:15.720 --> 2:03:21.720]  and being sort of encouraged to follow by our government because it doesn't make Israel safer.
[2:03:21.720 --> 2:03:27.720]  What to learn from the last few years should be that Israel has to stop its attitude
[2:03:27.720 --> 2:03:33.720]  toward destroying everyone who could pose a threat and sitting down at the negotiation table
[2:03:33.720 --> 2:03:38.720]  like most civilized countries do and working out arrangements where people can live in peace
[2:03:38.720 --> 2:03:41.720]  by mutual respecting one another.
[2:03:41.720 --> 2:03:44.720]  Ray McGovern, stay there. I've got one more set of questions
[2:03:44.720 --> 2:03:48.720]  and we're going to call in the final segment with you on the other side.
[2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:53.720]  And I'm going to ask the question, is there a difference between John McCain and Barack Obama
[2:03:53.720 --> 2:04:00.720]  and will attacking Iran be the October surprise for John McCain or does it even matter?
[2:04:00.720 --> 2:04:22.720]  We'll be right back with Ray McGovern and your phone calls.

[2:07:04.720 --> 2:07:09.720]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show
[2:07:09.720 --> 2:07:15.720]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[2:07:15.720 --> 2:07:23.720]  We interview a lot of intelligence analysts and political experts who've been studying things for decades
[2:07:23.720 --> 2:07:28.720]  and have pretty much come up with the same breakdown or similar breakdown.
[2:07:28.720 --> 2:07:31.720]  I want to get Ray McGovern's take on this.
[2:07:31.720 --> 2:07:34.720]  And basically, Israel's put this in their newspapers.
[2:07:34.720 --> 2:07:40.720]  They've made it known that if Barack Obama is elected in November,
[2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:45.720]  that they will attack earlier.
[2:07:45.720 --> 2:07:52.720]  They will attack during the last three months that Bush has in office in November, December,
[2:07:52.720 --> 2:07:56.720]  into January, probably right after the election.
[2:07:56.720 --> 2:07:59.720]  If McCain is elected, they may wait a little bit.
[2:07:59.720 --> 2:08:08.720]  And that's A, B, from the inside sources you have and from studying the situation, Ray McGovern,
[2:08:08.720 --> 2:08:11.720]  would there be a difference under a Barack Obama?
[2:08:11.720 --> 2:08:13.720]  I mean, earlier he'd said a lot of things.
[2:08:13.720 --> 2:08:15.720]  Now he's backtracking on all of them.
[2:08:15.720 --> 2:08:18.720]  War and less spying, war, all of it.
[2:08:18.720 --> 2:08:21.720]  He said publicly, don't just think if I get elected that Iran's off the hook,
[2:08:21.720 --> 2:08:24.720]  we'll support something, we'll support Israel.
[2:08:24.720 --> 2:08:26.720]  So there are the questions.
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:30.720]  A, when do you think the war is on, if it's on, depending on who gets elected?
[2:08:30.720 --> 2:08:33.720]  And B, is there a difference between the candidates?
[2:08:33.720 --> 2:08:36.720]  Well, let me put it this way.
[2:08:36.720 --> 2:08:42.720]  I see a perfect storm brewing for October, maybe September.
[2:08:42.720 --> 2:08:45.720]  We're talking one month away or two months away.
[2:08:45.720 --> 2:08:51.720]  First off, at that point, there will only be three months left of Bush and Cheney.
[2:08:51.720 --> 2:08:57.720]  Secondly, it'll be much clearer than it is now.
[2:08:57.720 --> 2:09:03.720]  Nobody seems to wise up to the fact that we've been invited out of Iraq and that the surge has failed.
[2:09:03.720 --> 2:09:10.720]  The surge has failed because the surge was designed to give some breathing space for Iraqi
[2:09:10.720 --> 2:09:16.720]  power politicians to put it all together so that they could have a place that we could leave.
[2:09:16.720 --> 2:09:21.720]  So it will be no longer in Iraq and the force we are now, this time next year,
[2:09:21.720 --> 2:09:24.720]  and that gives the Israelis connections, okay?
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:26.720]  Now, Abidzid.
[2:09:26.720 --> 2:09:28.720]  Abidzid takes over in September.
[2:09:28.720 --> 2:09:29.720]  Who does he report to?
[2:09:29.720 --> 2:09:31.720]  He reports to Cheney.
[2:09:31.720 --> 2:09:33.720]  There's chapter and verse I can cite about that.
[2:09:33.720 --> 2:09:36.720]  It's clear that when Cheney tells him to lie, for example,
[2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:41.720]  about the Iranian provision, so-called, of weapons in Iraq, he lies.
[2:09:41.720 --> 2:09:44.720]  He can't prove it, and later the press forgets all about it.
[2:09:44.720 --> 2:09:48.720]  The fourth element here has to do with McCain.
[2:09:48.720 --> 2:09:52.720]  Now, this is not a necessary element of this equation,
[2:09:52.720 --> 2:09:58.720]  but my suggestion is that McCain is likely to have his numbers in the toilet by this time.
[2:09:58.720 --> 2:10:00.720]  They're not so good now.
[2:10:00.720 --> 2:10:04.720]  I don't think he, with the economy just falling apart,
[2:10:04.720 --> 2:10:09.720]  I think his numbers are going to be so low that there'll be some sort of effort
[2:10:09.720 --> 2:10:15.720]  to see some magical way to raise them and what could do that better than have a wider war.
[2:10:15.720 --> 2:10:19.720]  I mean, if a terrorist incident would boost McCain's number,
[2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:22.720]  well, so much the more would a wider war.
[2:10:22.720 --> 2:10:23.720]  So there we have it.
[2:10:23.720 --> 2:10:24.720]  Three months left.
[2:10:24.720 --> 2:10:27.720]  We're no longer in Iraq coming this next year.
[2:10:27.720 --> 2:10:29.720]  Abidzid is gone.
[2:10:29.720 --> 2:10:35.720]  We have, if I said Abidzid, I met Petraeus, of course, and Petraeus is in there.
[2:10:35.720 --> 2:10:36.720]  He reports to Cheney.
[2:10:36.720 --> 2:10:43.720]  By the way, Cheney and the White House can order our commanders,
[2:10:43.720 --> 2:10:48.720]  like the chief of SENTCOM, which will, of course, be Petraeus.
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:54.720]  They can order them to make a war without having to go through Mullen.
[2:10:54.720 --> 2:10:55.720]  That's the law.
[2:10:55.720 --> 2:11:02.720]  The JCS, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is sort of like an information, a CC on this order.
[2:11:02.720 --> 2:11:08.720]  The White House can bypass that and simply give the order to Petraeus.
[2:11:08.720 --> 2:11:12.720]  So what we have here is a very delicate situation.
[2:11:12.720 --> 2:11:16.720]  I'm looking at it mostly from the Israeli perspective,
[2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:21.720]  because I've become convinced that Mullen is probably strong enough,
[2:11:21.720 --> 2:11:28.720]  that is, the uniformed military is probably strong enough to resist an order from Cheney and Bush
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:30.720]  to start the war themselves.
[2:11:30.720 --> 2:11:35.720]  But once the Israelis, because they're the ones that feel this is their last best chance...
[2:11:35.720 --> 2:11:36.720]  Once they pull the trigger.
[2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:40.720]  Once they pull the trigger, or they would both feet, and the president has promised.
[2:11:40.720 --> 2:11:42.720]  He keeps calling Israel our ally.
[2:11:42.720 --> 2:11:46.720]  There is no mutual defense treaty between U.S. and Israel.
[2:11:46.720 --> 2:11:47.720]  People should know that.
[2:11:47.720 --> 2:11:54.720]  So if the Israelis want to get us involved in a big war, we could tell them, as Mullen has repeatedly told them,
[2:11:54.720 --> 2:11:55.720]  not to do it.
[2:11:55.720 --> 2:11:58.720]  The only problem is, Cheney tells them, go ahead and do it.
[2:11:58.720 --> 2:12:01.720]  So, Rema Governe, I don't put words in your mouth, but from what you're saying,
[2:12:01.720 --> 2:12:05.720]  I'm getting the intel you're getting and just looking at the scene.
[2:12:05.720 --> 2:12:08.720]  You're saying October is the prime time.
[2:12:08.720 --> 2:12:10.720]  You're thinking they may move before the election,
[2:12:10.720 --> 2:12:16.720]  not thinking they'll have the political power as complete lame ducks to attack after the election.
[2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:20.720]  I think that's likely, and there's the business about helping McCain.
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:24.720]  They would think that that would enhance his chances.
[2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:26.720]  And we've had Republican memos.
[2:12:26.720 --> 2:12:31.720]  We've had his chief advisor salivating over a war, or a terrorist attack.
[2:12:31.720 --> 2:12:32.720]  Yeah.
[2:12:32.720 --> 2:12:33.720]  So, all those things.
[2:12:33.720 --> 2:12:35.720]  But now, this is guesswork, pretty much.
[2:12:35.720 --> 2:12:38.720]  This is an estimate on my part.
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:44.720]  Others, whom I respect, fully expect this kind of thing to happen.
[2:12:44.720 --> 2:12:50.720]  Today, I suggest it will happen, but not until after the election when McCain has already lost.
[2:12:50.720 --> 2:12:52.720]  I'm less persuaded that that's likely.
[2:12:52.720 --> 2:12:56.720]  I think it's more likely to have an October or even a September surprise.
[2:12:56.720 --> 2:12:59.720]  So, the debate within your colleagues isn't when they're...
[2:12:59.720 --> 2:13:01.720]  I mean, isn't if they're going to attack, but when they're going to attack.
[2:13:01.720 --> 2:13:05.720]  Most of us feel that an attack is more likely than not.
[2:13:05.720 --> 2:13:09.720]  And you know, Alex, just to take two steps back here, you know,
[2:13:09.720 --> 2:13:13.720]  since when is it respectable for a country
[2:13:13.720 --> 2:13:18.720]  to have open discourse about, oh, I wonder when our country will attack Iran.
[2:13:18.720 --> 2:13:23.720]  Do you think it would be before the election, or maybe it would be better after the election?
[2:13:23.720 --> 2:13:24.720]  I mean, it used to be.
[2:13:24.720 --> 2:13:29.720]  I mean, I'm not all that old, but I remember a time when attacking another country was...
[2:13:29.720 --> 2:13:30.720]  You're legal.
[2:13:30.720 --> 2:13:31.720] ...found upon, you know?
[2:13:31.720 --> 2:13:35.720]  I mean, what's become of our discourse here, where we just simply say,
[2:13:35.720 --> 2:13:38.720]  well, we'll attack Iran, the only question is when.
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:39.720]  That's awful.
[2:13:39.720 --> 2:13:41.720]  So, it's a foregone conclusion.
[2:13:41.720 --> 2:13:48.720]  John Paul says on the Hill, the only debate is, will the U.S. immediately aid Israel in the first attack,
[2:13:48.720 --> 2:13:52.720]  or once the attack begins, and Iran no doubt responds in some way,
[2:13:52.720 --> 2:13:57.720]  then they'll shriek and say, you know, like an elephant to a mouse, oh my God, they fought back.
[2:13:57.720 --> 2:14:00.720]  This is the greatest crime in history, and that they're...
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:05.720]  He says colleagues he's known for decades are walking around with self-satisfied smiles,
[2:14:05.720 --> 2:14:07.720]  talking about how wonderful it's going to be to nuke them.
[2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:11.720]  I mean, it's just infantile mindlessness.
[2:14:11.720 --> 2:14:16.720]  Yeah, I have a lot of adjectives for it, Alex, but I can't use them on the air.
[2:14:16.720 --> 2:14:19.720]  Well, I want to get to some calls, and I don't want to...
[2:14:19.720 --> 2:14:21.720]  You know, this is so important, and we've gone further.
[2:14:21.720 --> 2:14:23.720]  Let's go to the bottom of the R.A. and then I promise I'll let you go,
[2:14:23.720 --> 2:14:28.720]  because I've got a few more questions before we do take three or four calls that are lined up here.
[2:14:28.720 --> 2:14:32.720]  Just looking at the Israeli mindset of, you know, intelligent, smart,
[2:14:32.720 --> 2:14:38.720]  but incredibly arrogant, incredibly self-assured, you know, I think there's the M.O. there throughout history,
[2:14:38.720 --> 2:14:43.720]  but you would think that after a few thousand Hezbollah,
[2:14:43.720 --> 2:14:47.720]  which they're angry at Iran, they believe backing it, and obviously probably were,
[2:14:47.720 --> 2:14:51.720]  kicking their butt in their supposed invincible super battle tank,
[2:14:51.720 --> 2:14:53.720]  and the Israelis were even using...
[2:14:53.720 --> 2:14:57.720]  There's video of them loading nerve gas canisters into artillery,
[2:14:57.720 --> 2:15:02.720]  still getting beat in a checkered board infantry defense with just rockets,
[2:15:02.720 --> 2:15:04.720]  rocket-propelled grenades.
[2:15:04.720 --> 2:15:10.720]  How does Israel think they can take on Iran if they can't even beat Hezbollah militia?
[2:15:10.720 --> 2:15:14.720]  Well, that's just it, Alex. It wouldn't be Israel taking on Iran.
[2:15:14.720 --> 2:15:18.720]  It would be Israel and us, and that's what they would depend on.
[2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:20.720]  Is there a risk there?
[2:15:20.720 --> 2:15:25.720]  Well, depending on how they judge the relative credibility of Mullen on the one hand,
[2:15:25.720 --> 2:15:29.720]  who has said that, you know, don't start something like this
[2:15:29.720 --> 2:15:32.720]  because we're not going to get in there with you,
[2:15:32.720 --> 2:15:37.720]  and particularly, don't have the kind of provocation that happened with the U.S. as liberty.
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:40.720]  He even raised the U.S. as liberty incident with the Israelis.
[2:15:40.720 --> 2:15:42.720]  Oh, that's incredible. Flesh that out.
[2:15:42.720 --> 2:15:47.720]  I mean, so much is happening daily that I mentioned that, but hardly covered it Monday.
[2:15:47.720 --> 2:15:50.720]  Yeah, talk about that. That's incredible.
[2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:55.720]  You know, well, he gratuitously said to the Israelis, look, you know,
[2:15:55.720 --> 2:16:01.720]  you almost sunk the U.S. as liberty on the 8th of June in 1967.
[2:16:01.720 --> 2:16:03.720]  We don't want that to happen again.
[2:16:03.720 --> 2:16:06.720]  So, you know, you've got to be really careful.
[2:16:06.720 --> 2:16:09.720]  Now, he didn't come right out and say,
[2:16:09.720 --> 2:16:14.720]  whatever you do, don't think you can sink one of our ships and start a war between us and Iran.
[2:16:14.720 --> 2:16:16.720]  But that's the way you put it.
[2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:21.720]  Now, for our naval officer to finally raise this with the Israelis
[2:16:21.720 --> 2:16:27.720]  after our Navy has been so cowardly, and I say that word advisedly, so cowardly,
[2:16:27.720 --> 2:16:31.720]  and our administration and Congress have been so cowardly not to protest to the Israelis
[2:16:31.720 --> 2:16:38.720]  for the deliberate killing of 34 seamen and the deliberate wounding of 171 seamen
[2:16:38.720 --> 2:16:41.720]  on the 8th of June, 1967.
[2:16:41.720 --> 2:16:48.720]  I have an admiral finally raised this. Give me some courage. Give me some hope that this guy's got nerves of steel.
[2:16:48.720 --> 2:16:53.720]  You know, we're down side about all that, of course, is that, you know, they can look at Mullen
[2:16:53.720 --> 2:16:58.720]  and they can see him protest as he has three times since he was in Israel,
[2:16:58.720 --> 2:17:01.720]  that, you know, we don't want a third front. We don't want a third front.
[2:17:01.720 --> 2:17:05.720]  I mean, he's protesting. Not to the Israelis already told those.
[2:17:05.720 --> 2:17:10.720]  He's trying to tell Congress. He's trying to tell the White House, no, not a third front, okay?
[2:17:10.720 --> 2:17:15.720]  Who are the Israelis listening to? Well, I know they're listening to, they're listening to Cheney
[2:17:15.720 --> 2:17:20.720]  and they're listening to Elliott Abrams and all those idiots that started the war.
[2:17:20.720 --> 2:17:22.720]  They've never been in intelligence. They've never been in the military.
[2:17:22.720 --> 2:17:25.720]  They are literally divorced from reality.
[2:17:25.720 --> 2:17:27.720]  Yeah, and they don't really care much, you know.
[2:17:27.720 --> 2:17:32.720]  If this whole idea is about inserting U.S. bases in that part of the world,
[2:17:32.720 --> 2:17:37.720]  if it's about having special rights or special control over the oil,
[2:17:37.720 --> 2:17:40.720]  well, they'll give it their best shot and if it doesn't work,
[2:17:40.720 --> 2:17:47.720]  well, they go out of office in January, they go off to hunt and live in Crawford or wherever
[2:17:47.720 --> 2:17:52.720]  and it'll be left for the rest of us to pick up the pieces.
[2:17:52.720 --> 2:17:56.720]  Well, you talk about the economy imploding every analyst.
[2:17:56.720 --> 2:17:59.720]  I mean, I've seen no one who has said that it's going to make the economy better.
[2:17:59.720 --> 2:18:04.720]  In fact, everybody we've talked to economists say that this will probably push into a depression.
[2:18:04.720 --> 2:18:08.720]  Well, you haven't talked to the military industrial complex,
[2:18:08.720 --> 2:18:12.720]  but Alex, because they stand to make megabucks out of a new war.
[2:18:12.720 --> 2:18:16.720]  No, you're quite right. I mean, it would be a disaster.
[2:18:16.720 --> 2:18:20.720]  And what I can't quite figure out is why the European leaders,
[2:18:20.720 --> 2:18:23.720]  and even Russia and China, to a good extent,
[2:18:23.720 --> 2:18:26.720]  seem so blozzy about all this stuff, I would expect.
[2:18:26.720 --> 2:18:30.720]  Maybe it's being suppressed, but I would expect them to be speaking out very loudly.
[2:18:30.720 --> 2:18:33.720]  Well, the Russians have said they're letting us get into something that'll destroy us.
[2:18:33.720 --> 2:18:37.720]  It's kind of seen as, well, let the idiots do it.
[2:18:37.720 --> 2:18:41.720]  I'm afraid that's correct. And besides, the price of oil goes up,
[2:18:41.720 --> 2:18:46.720]  so do the Russian treachery.
[2:18:46.720 --> 2:18:48.720]  I'm going to talk to Ray McGovern during the break.
[2:18:48.720 --> 2:18:52.720]  Earlier he said I could have him as long as I wanted, but I don't want to abuse his time.
[2:18:52.720 --> 2:18:55.720]  But this is all so important when we're discussing here.
[2:18:55.720 --> 2:18:57.720]  So much is coming out.
[2:18:57.720 --> 2:18:59.720]  I'm going to talk to him during the break and see how long he can stay with us
[2:18:59.720 --> 2:19:01.720]  so we can take calls. Stay with us, Ray McGovern.
[2:19:01.720 --> 2:19:04.720]  We'll be right back. PrisonPlanet.com

[2:20:04.720 --> 2:20:09.720]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[2:20:09.720 --> 2:20:13.720]  I went to grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[2:20:13.720 --> 2:20:20.720]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:20:20.720 --> 2:20:26.720]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT, made a statement
[2:20:26.720 --> 2:20:29.720]  that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:20:29.720 --> 2:20:36.720]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:20:36.720 --> 2:20:39.720]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:20:39.720 --> 2:20:45.720]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

[2:21:03.720 --> 2:21:09.720]  Question, is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[2:21:09.720 --> 2:21:14.720]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:20.720]  Question, are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[2:21:20.720 --> 2:21:25.720]  Question, do you have 7 years of healthy food for your family?

[2:22:03.720 --> 2:22:05.720]  Why should we fire Congress?
[2:22:05.720 --> 2:22:09.720]  Because they use the Constitution of the United States as a scrap of paper.
[2:22:09.720 --> 2:22:11.720]  They swear an oath to follow it and then they reject it.
[2:22:11.720 --> 2:22:14.720]  That was their employment document.
[2:22:14.720 --> 2:22:15.720]  They haven't followed it.
[2:22:15.720 --> 2:22:17.720]  Congressman, senators, you're fired.
[2:22:17.720 --> 2:22:19.720]  Washington, you're fired!
[2:22:19.720 --> 2:22:21.720]  I think it's the next freedom to fascism.
[2:22:21.720 --> 2:22:25.720]  Washington, you're fired was born out of sheer frustration with abuses in our current political system
[2:22:25.720 --> 2:22:28.720]  and it gives a voice to Americans across the country.
[2:22:28.720 --> 2:22:32.720]  Washington, you're fired examines constitutional issues as they relate to the Katrina disaster,
[2:22:32.720 --> 2:22:36.720]  the president's illegal spy program, NSA data mining, FISA secret court,
[2:22:36.720 --> 2:22:41.720]  the illegal wiretapping of millions of Americans and the last 7 years of terror-related spy bills,
[2:22:41.720 --> 2:22:44.720]  how they affect you and what you can do about it.
[2:22:44.720 --> 2:22:48.720]  When you're fired, captures the spirit and zest of an old-fashioned Boston Tea Party.
[2:22:48.720 --> 2:22:52.720]  Cam Williams describes the film as a rabble-rousing call to arms.
[2:22:52.720 --> 2:22:54.720]  We invite you to make the change with us.
[2:22:54.720 --> 2:22:56.720]  Help take back our government now.
[2:22:56.720 --> 2:23:00.720]  Go to takebackwashington.com and get the video tools you need for the information war.
[2:23:00.720 --> 2:23:02.720]  We have a plan to take back our government.
[2:23:02.720 --> 2:23:04.720]  Please visit takebackwashington.com.
[2:23:04.720 --> 2:23:14.720]  I'm your master of war. Here to build the big guns.
[2:23:14.720 --> 2:23:19.720]  Ray's going to be with us till 45 in. Here to build the death planes.
[2:23:19.720 --> 2:23:24.720]  Again, I just state the fact that it's so amazing they're using the army to spy on Americans and provocateur
[2:23:24.720 --> 2:23:32.720]  and private goons, no doubt, to go threaten people's wives for news websites
[2:23:32.720 --> 2:23:36.720]  and to threaten me and just all the craziness.
[2:23:36.720 --> 2:23:38.720]  How do these people not know they're the bad guys?
[2:23:38.720 --> 2:23:42.720]  Well, they've bought into, we're doing the right thing, terrorists hit us,
[2:23:42.720 --> 2:23:44.720]  and we've got to shut everybody up. It's against the war.
[2:23:44.720 --> 2:23:46.720]  We've got to ban protests because it's against the war.
[2:23:46.720 --> 2:23:51.720]  I'll never forget the Deputy Attorney General in the Oakland Tribune.
[2:23:51.720 --> 2:23:57.720]  Just about, well, right on the eve of the Gulf War, the second one in 2003,
[2:23:57.720 --> 2:23:59.720]  and I'll never forget Mr. Calhoun in the paper saying,
[2:23:59.720 --> 2:24:04.720]  we're going to ban protest statewide because this war, this was a Democratic Deputy Attorney General,
[2:24:04.720 --> 2:24:10.720]  the war is against Al Qaeda, and so protesting a war against Al Qaeda is aiding terrorists,
[2:24:10.720 --> 2:24:13.720]  and so we're going to ban protest. That was in the Oakland Tribune.
[2:24:13.720 --> 2:24:16.720]  I read it over and over again on air. We even tried to get him on the show.
[2:24:16.720 --> 2:24:20.720]  It was an official press release we got from him. Press conference he gave.
[2:24:20.720 --> 2:24:25.720]  That's the attitude. That's the chilling effect they want, really, in both parties.
[2:24:25.720 --> 2:24:27.720]  Ray McGovern, we're going to the calls here in a moment,
[2:24:27.720 --> 2:24:30.720]  but that's my final question for you before we go to calls is,
[2:24:30.720 --> 2:24:32.720]  do you see any hope of if Barack Obama is elected?
[2:24:32.720 --> 2:24:37.720]  Because I, frankly, see pretty much lockstep by the Democrats.
[2:24:37.720 --> 2:24:40.720]  I mean, they'll say one thing that their constituents to get elected with what's popular,
[2:24:40.720 --> 2:24:47.720]  but their actions show that they are lockstep with whatever this administration is.
[2:24:47.720 --> 2:24:51.720]  Yeah, Alex, I would see it more as their rhetoric.
[2:24:51.720 --> 2:24:56.720]  Some of the things that have disappointed me greatly about Obama
[2:24:56.720 --> 2:25:01.720]  is felt need to couch out to the Israel lobby and say extraordinary things
[2:25:01.720 --> 2:25:05.720]  like Jerusalem should remain united and under Israel control.
[2:25:05.720 --> 2:25:10.720]  I mean, those things are, those things are so patently tendering to the lobby
[2:25:10.720 --> 2:25:13.720]  that they disappoint me greatly.
[2:25:13.720 --> 2:25:19.720]  Now, if he came into office, you know, it's always a matter of compared to what.
[2:25:19.720 --> 2:25:23.720]  I mean, look, I love what McCain would have us do.
[2:25:23.720 --> 2:25:27.720]  Stay in Iraq forever, you know, well, not forever, just 100 years.
[2:25:27.720 --> 2:25:30.720]  That's not hyperbole. That's the way he sees it.
[2:25:30.720 --> 2:25:35.720]  And that, you know, our commitment in Iraq is going to so royal,
[2:25:35.720 --> 2:25:38.720]  the American people of the next couple of years, if it continues,
[2:25:38.720 --> 2:25:42.720]  that we will have the equivalent of an insurrection.
[2:25:42.720 --> 2:25:45.720]  And then you're going to see a repression full-time.
[2:25:45.720 --> 2:25:47.720]  Well, McCain just said, as you know, two weeks ago,
[2:25:47.720 --> 2:25:50.720]  that, oh, we're going to have a national draft if we're hit by terrorists again.
[2:25:50.720 --> 2:25:54.720]  Yeah, yeah. So, you can see where they're coming at things.
[2:25:54.720 --> 2:25:56.720]  McCain, I don't think, can really speak.
[2:25:56.720 --> 2:25:59.720]  He can really think in geopolitical terms.
[2:25:59.720 --> 2:26:04.720]  And Obama has a couple of things indicating that he realizes that, you know,
[2:26:04.720 --> 2:26:08.720]  the roots of terror, the swamp in which terrorists breed,
[2:26:08.720 --> 2:26:13.720]  have to do with grievances that they consider to be legitimate,
[2:26:13.720 --> 2:26:15.720]  and many of them are legitimate.
[2:26:15.720 --> 2:26:19.720]  If you don't address those, you know, it's like shooting mosquitoes coming out of the swamp
[2:26:19.720 --> 2:26:21.720]  rather than draining the swamp.
[2:26:21.720 --> 2:26:26.720]  Why do you think that the Republicans put somebody forward like McCain?
[2:26:26.720 --> 2:26:29.720]  I mean, the guy has the charisma of a June buck.
[2:26:29.720 --> 2:26:33.720]  He doesn't. I mean, he comes off as completely mentally ill.
[2:26:33.720 --> 2:26:37.720]  Well, you've got a pretty wife, and look at the others.
[2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:42.720]  I mean, again, if compared to what, I mean, the others who are, you know,
[2:26:42.720 --> 2:26:45.720]  I watch the others, and I, you know, well, bear any comment on them.
[2:26:45.720 --> 2:26:52.720]  But here's McCain, you know, the surge, you know, his big thing, of course, is the surge.
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:58.720]  And what people don't realize is that the president himself was very specific
[2:26:58.720 --> 2:27:01.720]  when he explained the reason for the surge, and I quote him,
[2:27:01.720 --> 2:27:08.720]  it is to create breathing space to help make a political reconciliation possible.
[2:27:08.720 --> 2:27:10.720]  Now, that's what he said.
[2:27:10.720 --> 2:27:16.720]  Now, if that was the real intention, and it hasn't been achieved because just yesterday,
[2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:21.720]  just yesterday, the Iraqi parliament went on vacation for a month
[2:27:21.720 --> 2:27:27.720]  without approving an election law, without approving an arrangement to share the oil revenue,
[2:27:27.720 --> 2:27:31.720]  without approving anything, they're no closer than they were 15 months ago.
[2:27:31.720 --> 2:27:36.720]  And they've asked the US to leave, proving that it's, that they're running nothing,
[2:27:36.720 --> 2:27:42.720]  and on top of that, they admit what the surge really is, is paying off the different factions,
[2:27:42.720 --> 2:27:48.720]  hundreds of millions a piece every few months, and I was talking to a special forces colonel
[2:27:48.720 --> 2:27:51.720]  when I was up in D.C. covering things.
[2:27:51.720 --> 2:27:55.720]  I literally had the spooks asking me if I planned anything violent,
[2:27:55.720 --> 2:27:59.720]  and then introducing me to the special forces colonel with his high and tight haircut,
[2:27:59.720 --> 2:28:01.720]  it was going, and they started trying to sell me, Ray.
[2:28:01.720 --> 2:28:05.720]  I mean, if this is, I guess like they were the KGB trying to recruit me there in the restaurant,
[2:28:05.720 --> 2:28:09.720]  it was ridiculous going, you know, Alex, the surge is working, and I go, you're paying them all off.
[2:28:09.720 --> 2:28:11.720]  And they went in to tell me how great it was.
[2:28:11.720 --> 2:28:16.720]  I mean, that's how amateur is, it is now, Ray, is the guys that are following me one day
[2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:19.720]  are then coming up to me, trying to be my friend in the bar the next.
[2:28:19.720 --> 2:28:24.720]  Yeah, and what most people don't realize, and we said this, some of us said this from the start,
[2:28:24.720 --> 2:28:29.720]  the surge had one purpose, and that was to avoid a definitive defeat for US forces
[2:28:29.720 --> 2:28:32.720]  before Cheney and Bush left office.
[2:28:32.720 --> 2:28:35.720]  In that sense, it's worked beautifully for them.
[2:28:35.720 --> 2:28:39.720]  You put 30,000 more troops in there, you're going to prevent a definitive defeat.
[2:28:39.720 --> 2:28:43.720]  You'll have over a thousand more US men killed,
[2:28:43.720 --> 2:28:47.720]  but you'll be able to have, you'll be able to go out of office saying,
[2:28:47.720 --> 2:28:50.720]  well, we didn't lose it, it was the next administration.
[2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:52.720]  Here we go to your phone calls.
[2:28:54.720 --> 2:28:58.720]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[2:28:58.720 --> 2:29:02.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[2:29:24.720 --> 2:29:28.720]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[2:30:10.720 --> 2:30:13.720]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel,
[2:30:13.720 --> 2:30:16.720]  and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney,
[2:30:16.720 --> 2:30:20.720]  finalized the contract in London, and demoed our new product in Boston,

[2:30:26.720 --> 2:30:31.720]  I just talked to clients on the phone, and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop,
[2:30:31.720 --> 2:30:47.720]  and I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[2:31:04.720 --> 2:31:07.720]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[2:31:07.720 --> 2:31:15.720]  Did you know that the Prophet Jeremiah was told not to pray for the House of Judah anymore because of their personal and national sins?
[2:31:15.720 --> 2:31:22.720]  Could it be that God has ceased hearing prayers for America because of our personal and national sins also?
[2:31:22.720 --> 2:31:32.720]  Pornography, adultery, fornication, homosexuality, lesbianism, corporate theft, lust and greed are running rampant all over America,
[2:31:32.720 --> 2:31:35.720]  which was once declared a Christian nation.
[2:31:35.720 --> 2:31:37.720]  When will it all end?
[2:31:37.720 --> 2:31:40.720]  In slavery to the New World Order?

[2:32:58.720 --> 2:33:02.720]  We better do it. A lot of people are making big sacrifices to bring you this information,
[2:33:02.720 --> 2:33:08.720]  and we have a fighting chance if we speak out, if we cause a revolution of information and understanding,
[2:33:08.720 --> 2:33:13.720]  which we're seeing starting to happen. 1-800-259-9231.
[2:33:13.720 --> 2:33:20.720]  It's the number to join us on air. 888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to call and get the films and books.
[2:33:20.720 --> 2:33:24.720]  We have a big online video on bookstore at infoawards.com.
[2:33:24.720 --> 2:33:30.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Ohio holding patiently for Ray McGovern. Go ahead, John.
[2:33:30.720 --> 2:33:38.720]  Hi, Ray. I want to talk about an important article on informationclearinghouse.info,
[2:33:38.720 --> 2:33:43.720]  a comment entitled, Covert Ops to Overthrow Iran's Government.
[2:33:43.720 --> 2:33:46.720]  Covert Ops to Overthrow Iran's Government. I just wanted to pass it and mention that.
[2:33:46.720 --> 2:33:53.720]  I believe that Obama, as he's often referred to on WSWS.org,
[2:33:53.720 --> 2:34:00.720]  as the best asset the neocon warmongers have, and the Democrats as their best asset,
[2:34:00.720 --> 2:34:05.720]  because they are colluding, and I think that if we're going to protest at the Democratic Convention,
[2:34:05.720 --> 2:34:11.720]  we've got to cut through all of this nutty stuff about him being some kind of a progressive or a leftist or a Marxist.
[2:34:11.720 --> 2:34:18.720]  This is insane stuff. He is, as you said, a slavishly pushing every bit of the saber-rattling
[2:34:18.720 --> 2:34:23.720]  and whitewash of Israeli aggression, persecution, and saber-rattling.
[2:34:23.720 --> 2:34:26.720]  And I think that has to be exposed. That has to be the constant theme,
[2:34:26.720 --> 2:34:34.720]  that the Democrats and Obama are the best asset for bush warmongering.
[2:34:34.720 --> 2:34:39.720]  But at this article on information clearing outside info,
[2:34:39.720 --> 2:34:43.720]  I wanted to preface it by saying that I called George Norrie last week
[2:34:43.720 --> 2:34:46.720]  and I brought up this outrageous plan to kill American soldiers
[2:34:46.720 --> 2:34:49.720]  and post-flag us into a war with Iran.
[2:34:49.720 --> 2:34:54.720]  I've also mentioned on National Programs Terror Storm, promoted that.
[2:34:54.720 --> 2:34:58.720]  I'm on the left. I have to scream this with Mr. Jones.
[2:34:58.720 --> 2:35:06.720]  But I was appalled to hear probably the most rabid, neocon Israeli agent,
[2:35:06.720 --> 2:35:11.720]  CIA agent warmonger on the Monday program, Jerome Corsi.
[2:35:11.720 --> 2:35:17.720]  And this article on information clearinghouse.info details a lot of his connections
[2:35:17.720 --> 2:35:23.720]  to some of the most Israeli operations, the Israeli Zionist operations,
[2:35:23.720 --> 2:35:26.720]  the Central Intelligence Agency, though he denies it.
[2:35:26.720 --> 2:35:31.720]  His propaganda that would make even Cheney blush with shame
[2:35:31.720 --> 2:35:35.720]  that the Iranians have got a bomb that they want to plant in the United States
[2:35:35.720 --> 2:35:37.720]  and New York and blow us up an atomic bomb.
[2:35:37.720 --> 2:35:42.720]  This kind of stuff is the worst kind of arson propaganda.
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:46.720]  And I would hope that Mr. Jones was doing such great work in exposing all this,
[2:35:46.720 --> 2:35:49.720]  will not sabotage his own efforts in that respect.
[2:35:49.720 --> 2:35:54.720]  We have Dr. Corsi on who you can't prove is a CIA operative.
[2:35:54.720 --> 2:35:57.720]  I disagree with him on his stance with war.
[2:35:57.720 --> 2:36:00.720]  I disagree with Naomi Wolf. I'm on the leftists.
[2:36:00.720 --> 2:36:04.720]  But I have a lot of different views, a lot of perspectives on this show.
[2:36:04.720 --> 2:36:07.720]  And so obsessing over that all day.
[2:36:07.720 --> 2:36:10.720]  We're trying to give people a wide spectrum of look at things.
[2:36:10.720 --> 2:36:13.720]  But thank you for the call, John. Do you have any comments on that?
[2:36:13.720 --> 2:36:17.720]  Well, John and Alex, I find it really interesting
[2:36:17.720 --> 2:36:22.720]  that John would be citing information clearinghouse.info
[2:36:22.720 --> 2:36:30.720]  because that is John Feely's website, the one that we started talking about earlier today.
[2:36:30.720 --> 2:36:35.720]  So he's getting a smattering of all manner of different perspectives from that website.
[2:36:35.720 --> 2:36:39.720]  And it is crucial that that stay up and that we do a weekend
[2:36:39.720 --> 2:36:42.720]  to prevent him from being further harassed.
[2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:46.720]  Now, as far as the Democrats are concerned, you know,
[2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:49.720]  I would, if you're going to go to Denver and protest,
[2:36:49.720 --> 2:36:53.720]  I would protest against Mrs. Pelosi and Jay Rockefeller.
[2:36:53.720 --> 2:36:59.720]  Both of them well aware of the covert actions on torture,
[2:36:59.720 --> 2:37:04.720]  on illegal eavesdropping, on ABC and D of all this.
[2:37:04.720 --> 2:37:09.720]  And they were fully briefed and they not only pro-proved,
[2:37:09.720 --> 2:37:13.720]  but they clapped their hands and they kept it all secret from the rest of us.
[2:37:13.720 --> 2:37:17.720]  And so you ask yourself why they're against impeachment?
[2:37:17.720 --> 2:37:20.720]  Well, one of the reasons, one of the main reasons is
[2:37:20.720 --> 2:37:25.720]  any thorough investigation would disclose that they were co-conspirators.
[2:37:25.720 --> 2:37:27.720]  They were accomplices.
[2:37:27.720 --> 2:37:31.720]  Yeah, that's how tyranny works is that once people sign on to torture
[2:37:31.720 --> 2:37:35.720]  or illegal wars of aggression, then they feel like, you know,
[2:37:35.720 --> 2:37:37.720]  they've already robbed one bank. Why not rob ten more?
[2:37:37.720 --> 2:37:41.720]  Sure. And we're still Alex, you know, where they to deny that.
[2:37:41.720 --> 2:37:46.720]  Well, you know, we just happened to be monitoring your phone that day,
[2:37:46.720 --> 2:37:50.720]  and it's just Pelosi, so don't deny this.
[2:37:50.720 --> 2:37:52.720]  We've got the goods on you.
[2:37:52.720 --> 2:37:55.720]  So it all works just the way Jay and Grohova used to proceed,
[2:37:55.720 --> 2:37:59.720]  and it all works just the way we try to prevent it from working.
[2:37:59.720 --> 2:38:02.720]  When we passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,
[2:38:02.720 --> 2:38:07.720]  the FISA back in 1978 to prevent precisely this kind of thing.
[2:38:07.720 --> 2:38:09.720]  Yes, let's take another call.
[2:38:09.720 --> 2:38:11.720]  Kurt in Pennsylvania. You're on the air, Kurt.
[2:38:11.720 --> 2:38:12.720]  Hi, Kurt.
[2:38:12.720 --> 2:38:14.720]  Good morning. Hi, Alex.
[2:38:14.720 --> 2:38:17.720]  I just want to say, you guys are American heroes of the highest order,
[2:38:17.720 --> 2:38:19.720]  and it's an honor to speak to you.
[2:38:19.720 --> 2:38:22.720]  I've been on the streets as an activist for over 16 years,
[2:38:22.720 --> 2:38:24.720]  and trying to get people to be more vigorous citizens,
[2:38:24.720 --> 2:38:27.720]  because I think that at its core, what we're having here,
[2:38:27.720 --> 2:38:29.720]  we have a thousand different problems,
[2:38:29.720 --> 2:38:32.720]  and at its core is a bunch of lazy citizens.
[2:38:32.720 --> 2:38:34.720]  So in that effort, we're trying to create something called
[2:38:34.720 --> 2:38:38.720]  the Common Sense Revival.tripod.com. Check out our site.
[2:38:38.720 --> 2:38:41.720]  It's based on critical thinking and positive psychology,
[2:38:41.720 --> 2:38:44.720]  where people can become empowered through clear thinking
[2:38:44.720 --> 2:38:47.720]  and then deal with the depression that comes as being an activist.
[2:38:47.720 --> 2:38:50.720]  And also, I want to mention Pro-State Legal,
[2:38:50.720 --> 2:38:53.720]  because I'm actually having a jury trial in the federal court
[2:38:53.720 --> 2:38:55.720]  against the city of Wilkesburg, Pennsylvania,
[2:38:55.720 --> 2:38:58.720]  for infringing my free speech rights.
[2:38:58.720 --> 2:39:00.720]  So everybody's listening. Please make some signs,
[2:39:00.720 --> 2:39:02.720]  whatever issue that you would pick.
[2:39:02.720 --> 2:39:05.720]  Get active. Stop it. Action is victory.
[2:39:05.720 --> 2:39:07.720]  I absolutely agree with you, Kurt. Take care.
[2:39:07.720 --> 2:39:09.720]  Let's talk to Alan Los Angeles.
[2:39:09.720 --> 2:39:12.720]  Well, you're on the air.
[2:39:12.720 --> 2:39:13.720]  Yes, Al?
[2:39:13.720 --> 2:39:16.720]  Back in the 1990s, under Clinton,
[2:39:16.720 --> 2:39:19.720]  wasn't there some military guys from top military men
[2:39:19.720 --> 2:39:21.720]  that defected to France and a couple
[2:39:21.720 --> 2:39:25.720]  and some others that were killed over like Montana or something?
[2:39:25.720 --> 2:39:28.720]  Well, your phone's really bad, sir, but you're talking about...
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:29.720]  Can you hear me now?
[2:39:29.720 --> 2:39:30.720]  Yes, I can.
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:32.720]  All right. Back in the 1990s,
[2:39:32.720 --> 2:39:35.720]  did you hear about some top military guys
[2:39:35.720 --> 2:39:37.720]  that defected to France
[2:39:37.720 --> 2:39:39.720]  and some others that were assassinated
[2:39:39.720 --> 2:39:43.720]  and some plane crash over the north of northern states?
[2:39:43.720 --> 2:39:45.720]  No, I remember them blowing up
[2:39:45.720 --> 2:39:48.720]  Treasury Secretary Ron Brown's plane
[2:39:48.720 --> 2:39:52.720]  and then the head coroner in the Army
[2:39:52.720 --> 2:39:55.720]  said that he'd been shot in the head and others had been.
[2:39:55.720 --> 2:39:58.720]  They clearly had some type of black ops on board the plane.
[2:39:58.720 --> 2:40:01.720]  They shot everybody and then remote-controlled it into the side of a mountain.
[2:40:01.720 --> 2:40:04.720]  I mean, murder is just part of the way this government operates,
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:07.720]  but without specifics, I don't know what you're talking about.
[2:40:07.720 --> 2:40:08.720]  Ray, are you aware of any of that?
[2:40:08.720 --> 2:40:10.720]  No, I'm not.
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:12.720]  Okay, anything else, Al?
[2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:13.720]  Yeah, second question.
[2:40:13.720 --> 2:40:17.720]  What does God's kingdom mean to you?
[2:40:17.720 --> 2:40:19.720]  What does God's kingdom mean to me?
[2:40:19.720 --> 2:40:21.720]  Yeah.
[2:40:21.720 --> 2:40:26.720]  Well, I really don't know what you mean by that question.
[2:40:26.720 --> 2:40:28.720]  Sir, we're here talking about trying to stop
[2:40:28.720 --> 2:40:31.720]  what could potentially lead to a world war,
[2:40:31.720 --> 2:40:33.720]  world depression, a police state here in the U.S.
[2:40:33.720 --> 2:40:35.720]  that's being geared up.
[2:40:35.720 --> 2:40:37.720]  And, you know, I am a Christian,
[2:40:37.720 --> 2:40:40.720]  but I don't really get into all the thousands of different denominations
[2:40:40.720 --> 2:40:43.720]  and debates that go on.
[2:40:43.720 --> 2:40:45.720]  I mean, what does God's kingdom mean to you?
[2:40:45.720 --> 2:40:47.720]  Well, that's quite literal.
[2:40:47.720 --> 2:40:48.720]  I think it's quite literal to me,
[2:40:48.720 --> 2:40:50.720]  because I see these things as ongoing.
[2:40:50.720 --> 2:40:54.720]  So long as the sovereignty is in human hands,
[2:40:54.720 --> 2:40:57.720]  I can see tyranny rising again and again,
[2:40:57.720 --> 2:41:01.720]  just like Bible prophecy talks about all these wild beasts rising again and again.
[2:41:01.720 --> 2:41:03.720]  Well, listen, I agree with you, Al,
[2:41:03.720 --> 2:41:06.720]  but what I do hear every time we talk about serious issues is Christians calling
[2:41:06.720 --> 2:41:08.720]  and saying, you know, it's always going to be evil.
[2:41:08.720 --> 2:41:10.720]  We're always going to have problems.
[2:41:10.720 --> 2:41:12.720]  I see it all over our message boards at prisonplanet.com.
[2:41:12.720 --> 2:41:14.720]  You know, it's the end of the world.
[2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:15.720]  What are we going to do?
[2:41:15.720 --> 2:41:16.720]  Evil always comes back.
[2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:18.720]  Yeah, but good is always fought back against evil.
[2:41:18.720 --> 2:41:21.720]  And when good gives in to evil, when good men do nothing,
[2:41:21.720 --> 2:41:22.720]  it's when we get nightmares.
[2:41:22.720 --> 2:41:25.720]  And so kind of the, you know, the attitude of,
[2:41:25.720 --> 2:41:27.720]  well, evil always raises its head again.
[2:41:27.720 --> 2:41:29.720]  Yeah, and we always got to chop it off again.
[2:41:29.720 --> 2:41:33.720]  You know, we can't just pass the buck to God.
[2:41:33.720 --> 2:41:37.720]  Ray McGovern, you want to speak to this basic psychology?
[2:41:37.720 --> 2:41:39.720]  Well, I think you're right.
[2:41:39.720 --> 2:41:43.720]  You know, evil succeeds when good people do nothing.
[2:41:43.720 --> 2:41:45.720]  People need further proof of that.
[2:41:45.720 --> 2:41:48.720]  Just look at Nazi Germany in the 30s,
[2:41:48.720 --> 2:41:50.720]  where people really couldn't find their voice,
[2:41:50.720 --> 2:41:55.720]  really couldn't oppose what was going on.
[2:41:55.720 --> 2:41:57.720]  I thought as long as, you know, it was just the Jews
[2:41:57.720 --> 2:42:00.720]  or just the Gypsies or just the Pollocks or just the Catholics
[2:42:00.720 --> 2:42:04.720]  or whatever, that they could dunk her down and be safe.
[2:42:04.720 --> 2:42:08.720]  See, that's a good example of how not to act.
[2:42:08.720 --> 2:42:14.720]  And, you know, if you profess to be a follower of Jesus of Nazareth,
[2:42:14.720 --> 2:42:18.720]  you have no other option than to oppose evil on the spot.
[2:42:18.720 --> 2:42:20.720]  That was part of his message, you know?
[2:42:20.720 --> 2:42:24.720]  That's what we have to do, not only do good,
[2:42:24.720 --> 2:42:29.720]  but not avoid evil as the ethicists say,
[2:42:29.720 --> 2:42:31.720]  but oppose it on the spot.
[2:42:31.720 --> 2:42:33.720]  Well, look at the prophets.
[2:42:33.720 --> 2:42:35.720]  Most of them were killed for fighting evil.
[2:42:35.720 --> 2:42:38.720]  They always put themselves between the iron fist of the state,
[2:42:38.720 --> 2:42:41.720]  corruption, tyranny, and the innocence, the widows.
[2:42:41.720 --> 2:42:44.720]  It's better to tie a millstone around your neck
[2:42:44.720 --> 2:42:46.720]  and be cast in the deep of sea to hurt one of the little ones.
[2:42:46.720 --> 2:42:49.720]  And by not fighting evil, you are an accomplice to that
[2:42:49.720 --> 2:42:51.720]  and you sign your name to it.
[2:42:51.720 --> 2:42:52.720]  Two final calls.
[2:42:52.720 --> 2:42:53.720]  We're going to let Ray McGovern go.
[2:42:53.720 --> 2:42:54.720]  That's an amazing interview.
[2:42:54.720 --> 2:42:55.720]  Very thankful for him.
[2:42:55.720 --> 2:42:56.720]  Claire in West Virginia.
[2:42:56.720 --> 2:42:57.720]  You're on the air.
[2:42:57.720 --> 2:42:58.720]  And then Jim.
[2:42:58.720 --> 2:42:59.720]  Yeah, hi.
[2:42:59.720 --> 2:43:00.720]  This is Claire.
[2:43:00.720 --> 2:43:01.720]  Hi, Claire.
[2:43:01.720 --> 2:43:02.720]  Hi.
[2:43:02.720 --> 2:43:05.720]  The main thing, it was weird because I took the day off work today
[2:43:05.720 --> 2:43:07.720]  and I usually listen to rebroadcasts,
[2:43:07.720 --> 2:43:10.720]  even though I wanted to call in in the past.
[2:43:10.720 --> 2:43:14.720]  This happens to be probably one of the most interesting shows I've heard.
[2:43:14.720 --> 2:43:17.720]  I was thinking of all these different questions,
[2:43:17.720 --> 2:43:19.720]  and then you mentioned Jay Rockefeller.
[2:43:19.720 --> 2:43:23.720]  Okay, I'm from West Virginia.
[2:43:23.720 --> 2:43:27.720]  I've never supported Jay Rockefeller.
[2:43:27.720 --> 2:43:32.720]  I don't understand how the state ever let this New York millionaire in.
[2:43:32.720 --> 2:43:35.720]  But I'm wondering if you could give me a little more information
[2:43:35.720 --> 2:43:37.720]  so I could pass this on,
[2:43:37.720 --> 2:43:40.720]  because I haven't really followed as much what he's been doing.
[2:43:40.720 --> 2:43:43.720]  Well, he acts like he's against the war and torture and all this,
[2:43:43.720 --> 2:43:45.720]  then he signs on to it, right?
[2:43:45.720 --> 2:43:51.720]  Yeah, he, as you probably know, is head of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
[2:43:51.720 --> 2:43:56.720]  And he recently, to his credit, they came out with an exhaustive report
[2:43:56.720 --> 2:44:00.720]  saying that the president lied as into war by distorting,
[2:44:00.720 --> 2:44:03.720]  by manufacturing so-called intelligence.
[2:44:03.720 --> 2:44:04.720]  Now, that's to his credit.
[2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:08.720]  The only problem is that before he left the stage that day,
[2:44:08.720 --> 2:44:12.720]  he said, oh, and by the way, impeachment is not realistic.
[2:44:12.720 --> 2:44:16.720]  Well, now, why would a senator who has nothing to say about impeachment,
[2:44:16.720 --> 2:44:20.720]  why would he think it necessary to add that little footnote?
[2:44:20.720 --> 2:44:23.720]  Well, because he knows that if impeachment goes forward,
[2:44:23.720 --> 2:44:26.720]  he will be implicated in these charges because he approved them.
[2:44:26.720 --> 2:44:28.720]  How did he approve them?
[2:44:28.720 --> 2:44:30.720]  Because he was head of this committee.
[2:44:30.720 --> 2:44:34.720]  He was fully briefed on the torture, on the avoiding of the laws,
[2:44:34.720 --> 2:44:37.720]  having to do with illegal surveillance.
[2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:41.720]  And so he's implicated, chapter and verse.
[2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:45.720]  And besides, it took him five years to do this study about Iraq.
[2:44:45.720 --> 2:44:49.720]  He could have completed it as soon as he, as soon as it deprecated.
[2:44:49.720 --> 2:44:50.720]  They've got a term for it.
[2:44:50.720 --> 2:44:52.720]  He's covering his butt now.
[2:44:52.720 --> 2:44:54.720]  Well, yeah, that's a nice way to put it.
[2:44:54.720 --> 2:44:56.720]  Claire, thank you for the call.
[2:44:56.720 --> 2:44:57.720]  Last caller, Jim in New York.
[2:44:57.720 --> 2:45:00.720]  Go ahead.
[2:45:00.720 --> 2:45:01.720]  You there?
[2:45:01.720 --> 2:45:02.720]  Yes, sir.
[2:45:02.720 --> 2:45:03.720]  Hi, Kevin.
[2:45:03.720 --> 2:45:05.720]  It's the time I've ever got on.
[2:45:05.720 --> 2:45:09.720]  Listen, I just want to say that no matter what they do,
[2:45:09.720 --> 2:45:11.720]  they can't not make me a good man.
[2:45:11.720 --> 2:45:13.720]  I'm going to be a good man till the end.
[2:45:13.720 --> 2:45:15.720]  You're a good man.
[2:45:15.720 --> 2:45:18.720]  Good men will stand up.
[2:45:18.720 --> 2:45:19.720]  We're fighting a tyranny.
[2:45:19.720 --> 2:45:20.720]  You know that.
[2:45:20.720 --> 2:45:22.720]  And I believe right now we're in what we,
[2:45:22.720 --> 2:45:25.720]  what I would term as a soft police state anyhow.
[2:45:25.720 --> 2:45:26.720]  Yes.
[2:45:26.720 --> 2:45:28.720]  Soft martial law with checkpoints everywhere.
[2:45:28.720 --> 2:45:31.720]  SWAT teams going into people's homes, taking guns.
[2:45:31.720 --> 2:45:32.720]  And it's getting hotter.
[2:45:32.720 --> 2:45:34.720]  And it's getting hotter.
[2:45:34.720 --> 2:45:36.720]  And it's getting hotter.
[2:45:36.720 --> 2:45:38.720]  Well, good people are standing together.
[2:45:38.720 --> 2:45:40.720]  Good people are going to take care of this.
[2:45:40.720 --> 2:45:41.720]  This isn't going to end badly.
[2:45:41.720 --> 2:45:42.720]  It's going to be bloody.
[2:45:42.720 --> 2:45:46.720]  But listen, there are things that everybody can do.
[2:45:46.720 --> 2:45:48.720]  Be responsible for yourself.
[2:45:48.720 --> 2:45:51.720]  I know that I'm responsible for myself.
[2:45:51.720 --> 2:45:52.720]  I'm a good man.
[2:45:52.720 --> 2:45:54.720]  And I tell everybody around me.
[2:45:54.720 --> 2:45:58.720]  I have a 9-11 was an inside job sign out in front of my house.
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:02.720]  And I tell anybody who asks.
[2:46:02.720 --> 2:46:03.720]  Well, that's it.
[2:46:03.720 --> 2:46:05.720]  They can't get us all.
[2:46:05.720 --> 2:46:07.720]  In closing, I got to let Ray go in a minute.
[2:46:07.720 --> 2:46:10.720]  I just wanted to plug my website.
[2:46:10.720 --> 2:46:14.720]  My friends have a website, deprogrammed.wordpress.com.
[2:46:14.720 --> 2:46:16.720]  It is full of other liberty.
[2:46:16.720 --> 2:46:18.720]  All we talk about is liberty.
[2:46:18.720 --> 2:46:19.720]  We post articles.
[2:46:19.720 --> 2:46:20.720]  Good.
[2:46:20.720 --> 2:46:22.720]  That's what it's going to take a citizen media.
[2:46:22.720 --> 2:46:23.720]  I got to let you go.
[2:46:23.720 --> 2:46:25.720]  As I told Ray, he'd be gone by now.
[2:46:25.720 --> 2:46:27.720]  Ray McGovern, you got about 60 seconds.
[2:46:27.720 --> 2:46:29.720]  I want to thank you for coming on, my friend.
[2:46:29.720 --> 2:46:30.720]  And we're glad you're beating your cancer.
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:31.720]  Everybody should pray for you.
[2:46:31.720 --> 2:46:33.720]  And closing comments, sir.
[2:46:33.720 --> 2:46:37.720]  Well, I want to thank you for hosting me here.
[2:46:37.720 --> 2:46:43.720]  I think the callers indicated they're thinking rightly about all this.
[2:46:43.720 --> 2:46:45.720]  And I think Jim is quite right.
[2:46:45.720 --> 2:46:51.720]  There are enough of us, even though we seem to be in the minority.
[2:46:51.720 --> 2:46:58.720]  It was Cesar Chavez that used to always say, look, it doesn't take everyone.
[2:46:58.720 --> 2:47:00.720]  There are already enough of us.
[2:47:00.720 --> 2:47:02.720]  All we have to do is stop talking.
[2:47:02.720 --> 2:47:05.720]  All we have to do is start putting our bodies into it.
[2:47:05.720 --> 2:47:06.720]  Take action.
[2:47:06.720 --> 2:47:09.720]  And that's what I'd suggest that all of your listeners do.
[2:47:09.720 --> 2:47:13.720]  Think about ways that you can form small groups and thinking five, six people.
[2:47:13.720 --> 2:47:19.720]  Figure it out and do what you can do in your own little environment to advance the cause
[2:47:19.720 --> 2:47:21.720]  of truth and then justice.
[2:47:21.720 --> 2:47:22.720]  Well, that's it.
[2:47:22.720 --> 2:47:23.720]  Many hands make light work.
[2:47:23.720 --> 2:47:27.720]  And folks, it doesn't mean your little five, six, ten man team, woman team to save the
[2:47:27.720 --> 2:47:28.720]  world.
[2:47:28.720 --> 2:47:33.720]  All of us together, exposing, educating, standing up for liberty, starting media websites,
[2:47:33.720 --> 2:47:38.720]  access TV shows, calling into talk shows, local newsletters, all of it together.
[2:47:38.720 --> 2:47:41.720]  Knowing you're bringing them down, we'll bring them down.
[2:47:41.720 --> 2:47:42.720]  It's that simple.
[2:47:42.720 --> 2:47:46.720]  They wouldn't be trying to intimidate people if we weren't having an effect.
[2:47:46.720 --> 2:47:48.720]  Support alternative media.
[2:47:48.720 --> 2:47:53.720]  Understand that infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and informationclearinghouse.info.
[2:47:53.720 --> 2:47:58.720]  We're all being hacked and attacked and shut down and filtered and, you know, understand
[2:47:58.720 --> 2:47:59.720]  that we're on the tip of the spear.
[2:47:59.720 --> 2:48:00.720]  We need your support.
[2:48:00.720 --> 2:48:04.720]  Ray McGovern, thank you so much for spending so much time with us.
[2:48:04.720 --> 2:48:08.720]  I think this has been an amazing interview and we are very thankful for your time.
[2:48:08.720 --> 2:48:09.720]  You're most welcome, Alex.
[2:48:09.720 --> 2:48:10.720]  Take care.
[2:48:10.720 --> 2:48:13.720]  All right, folks, there goes Ray McGovern.
[2:48:13.720 --> 2:48:18.720]  For those that missed the first hour of the show, it was amazing too when I went over
[2:48:18.720 --> 2:48:22.720]  the intimidation, the threats that we go through, that others go through, just how real
[2:48:22.720 --> 2:48:25.220]  this is.
[2:48:25.220 --> 2:48:29.440]  When you have guys in high and tight haircuts in plain clothes, block your car in a parking
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:30.440]  lot.
[2:48:30.440 --> 2:48:32.360]  You get out and you say, what's going on?
[2:48:32.360 --> 2:48:35.440]  And they say, Mr. Jones, you better keep your mouth shut or bad things are going to happen
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:36.440]  to you.
[2:48:36.440 --> 2:48:43.320]  You know, that was a big wake-up call for me, I guess, eight, nine years ago, longer.
[2:48:43.320 --> 2:48:46.720]  When things like that happen, or when you get death threats, or when things like that,
[2:48:46.720 --> 2:48:51.400]  you know, real ones happen, or when you're being followed by special ops wearing clown
[2:48:51.400 --> 2:48:52.600]  mask.
[2:48:52.600 --> 2:48:53.600]  And that happened.
[2:48:53.600 --> 2:48:54.600]  Much people saw it.
[2:48:54.600 --> 2:48:55.600]  We tried to get video of it.
[2:48:55.600 --> 2:48:56.600]  I believe we got some video.
[2:48:56.600 --> 2:49:00.000]  We have to enhance it because they were driving by, you know, in Virginia.
[2:49:00.000 --> 2:49:04.440]  I mean, the government wearing clown masks, I mean, it's getting bad, folks.
[2:49:04.440 --> 2:49:08.880]  The government is ill, it's criminal, and they're engaged in all forms of crime.
[2:49:08.880 --> 2:49:11.240]  It's not enough for the government to ship in the heroin and cocaine.
[2:49:11.240 --> 2:49:14.720]  It's not enough for them to launder money and push Prozac and riddling on kids.
[2:49:14.720 --> 2:49:17.440]  It's not enough for CPS to be kidnapping all these children.
[2:49:17.440 --> 2:49:18.440]  It's not enough.
[2:49:18.440 --> 2:49:22.200]  It's not enough to be, you know, using the dollar globally to buy up real assets for
[2:49:22.200 --> 2:49:24.760]  the elite and then handing us the bill.
[2:49:24.760 --> 2:49:25.760]  It's not enough for them.
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:28.280]  They're not going to stop until we stop them.
[2:49:28.280 --> 2:49:29.440]  It's just going to get worse and worse.
[2:49:29.440 --> 2:49:30.440]  It's like a cancer.
[2:49:30.440 --> 2:49:33.040]  The country has cancer.
[2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:35.080]  The world has cancer.
[2:49:35.080 --> 2:49:36.440]  And we got to cut it out somehow.
[2:49:36.440 --> 2:49:40.800]  All right, I got a bunch of other news, more of your phone calls, then we got Jimmy Justice
[2:49:40.800 --> 2:49:44.640]  coming on, another example of what you can do, just amazing stuff straight ahead with
[2:49:44.640 --> 2:49:45.640]  that.
[2:49:45.640 --> 2:49:51.160]  You know, it's a good feeling, though, to be committed.
[2:49:51.160 --> 2:49:52.720]  I mean, I'm not even afraid of these people.
[2:49:52.720 --> 2:49:56.560]  I'm afraid I'm not going to do the best job I can with the time I have on this planet.
[2:49:56.560 --> 2:50:00.360]  I'm afraid of that, but I'm not afraid of them killing me or setting me up or anything.
[2:50:00.360 --> 2:50:01.360]  I am committed.
[2:50:01.360 --> 2:50:04.360]  I know why my cause is right, and that's the end of it.
[2:50:04.360 --> 2:50:06.360]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[2:50:06.360 --> 2:50:09.360]  I've come with a message of information.
[2:50:09.360 --> 2:50:11.880]  9-11 was an inside job.
[2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:13.560]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[2:50:13.560 --> 2:50:15.080]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[2:50:15.080 --> 2:50:17.880]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state?
[2:50:17.880 --> 2:50:22.080]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.
[2:50:22.080 --> 2:50:29.080]  The data we stop asking questions is the data that we have allowed the seeds of just
[2:50:29.080 --> 2:50:31.560]  criticism to grow at our own door.
[2:50:31.560 --> 2:50:37.080]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:50:37.080 --> 2:50:40.080]  An inside job?
[2:50:40.080 --> 2:50:41.080]  How dare you?
[2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:47.080]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:50:47.080 --> 2:50:50.080]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:50:50.080 --> 2:50:55.080]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th
[2:50:55.080 --> 2:50:56.080]  anniversary of 9-11.
[2:50:56.080 --> 2:50:57.080]  Please rise.
[2:50:57.080 --> 2:51:02.080]  Download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:51:02.080 --> 2:51:05.080]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:51:05.080 --> 2:51:09.580]  Of the 3 million plus edible food plants that grow on Earth, no other single plant can compare
[2:51:09.580 --> 2:51:13.580]  with the nutritional value of the powder, seeds, and oil of the hemp plant.
[2:51:13.580 --> 2:51:19.080]  At hempusa.org, we ship worldwide these nutritional products with free shipping to the U.S. and
[2:51:19.080 --> 2:51:20.080]  Canada.
[2:51:20.080 --> 2:51:24.580]  At hempusa.org, we want to educate our listeners that edible hemp is not marijuana and is
[2:51:24.580 --> 2:51:26.080]  certified THC-free.
[2:51:26.080 --> 2:51:30.080]  Our powder is 50% protein and does not contain gluten.
[2:51:30.080 --> 2:51:32.580]  Gluten impairs the cells from absorbing nutrients.
[2:51:32.580 --> 2:51:37.080]  This nutrient-dense food can be stored up to five years when vacuum packed and is priced
[2:51:37.080 --> 2:51:40.080]  affordably to be used as a storeable food.
[2:51:40.080 --> 2:51:43.080]  Hempusa.org is a bulk shipper starting with five pounds and up.
[2:51:43.080 --> 2:51:50.080]  To allow this food to work for you, call 908-691-2608 or go to hempusa.org and order today.
[2:51:50.080 --> 2:51:53.080]  The body will react and heal itself given the proper nutrition.
[2:51:53.080 --> 2:51:58.080]  This superfood will be your greatest asset, so try it today, store it today, and change
[2:51:58.080 --> 2:51:59.080]  your life.
[2:51:59.080 --> 2:52:04.080]  Call 908-691-2608 or order from hempusa.org.
[2:52:04.080 --> 2:52:07.080]  Alabama State Code makes it illegal to drive barefoot.
[2:52:07.080 --> 2:52:11.080]  In Downey, California, it's illegal to wash your car in the street.
[2:52:11.080 --> 2:52:15.080]  In Minnesota, you can be fined for displaying that your vehicle is for sale.
[2:52:15.080 --> 2:52:20.080]  These laws are obviously not made to protect us, but instead to help states profit.
[2:52:20.080 --> 2:52:23.080]  The use of red light cameras is another great example.
[2:52:23.080 --> 2:52:28.080]  They intrude on your privacy, are unconstitutional, and cost you valuable time and money.
[2:52:28.080 --> 2:52:33.080]  Sprayyourplate.com is a spray-on photo blocker that protects against red light cameras,
[2:52:33.080 --> 2:52:35.080]  toll cameras, and speed cameras.
[2:52:35.080 --> 2:52:41.080]  One application lasts a lifetime, is undetectable, and each can covers up to four license plates.
[2:52:41.080 --> 2:52:44.080]  Simply spray it on, let it dry, and you're protected.
[2:52:44.080 --> 2:52:48.080]  All orders are kept strictly confidential, and for the month of August, receive free shipping
[2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:51.080]  and a $5 bill enclosed with every order.
[2:52:51.080 --> 2:52:59.080]  Call 1-800-276-9601 or go to sprayyourplate.com.
[2:52:59.080 --> 2:53:04.080]  Don't give your money to the state, spray your plate.
[2:53:42.080 --> 2:53:46.080]  Whoever thought we'd get to this point with secret police running around threatening women,
[2:53:46.080 --> 2:53:54.080]  intimidating them, threatening their children, goons all over the place, TV ads, PR, billboards,
[2:53:54.080 --> 2:53:59.080]  worshipping the police state, government telling you how much it loves you, private corporations,
[2:53:59.080 --> 2:54:02.080]  buying up everything.
[2:54:02.080 --> 2:54:05.080]  I know there's a lot of good people in government who don't want to be part of this,
[2:54:05.080 --> 2:54:07.080]  and a lot of it isn't even your fault.
[2:54:07.080 --> 2:54:12.080]  It's the degenerate, lazy, stupid population on average, but that's not all of us,
[2:54:12.080 --> 2:54:16.080]  and we don't deserve this, and I'm not going quietly into the night.
[2:54:16.080 --> 2:54:18.080]  Jimmy Justus is coming up.
[2:54:18.080 --> 2:54:22.080]  I want to play some clips of him and tell you a little bit about him before we do that.
[2:54:22.080 --> 2:54:27.080]  Before I cover Jimmy Justus, I've made 19 films.
[2:54:27.080 --> 2:54:30.080]  The newest is Truth Rising, and this film needs to be seen.
[2:54:30.080 --> 2:54:36.080]  I mean, five minutes of the two-hour film, five minutes of it,
[2:54:36.080 --> 2:54:42.080]  is New York police saying that video cameras are guns and that backpacks are bombs
[2:54:42.080 --> 2:54:46.080]  and saying, we know you're not terrorists, but we're going to put you in prison for it.
[2:54:46.080 --> 2:54:51.080]  I mean, they're so corrupt now they try to frame you on videotape knowing they're being videotaped.
[2:54:51.080 --> 2:54:53.080]  I mean, it's one thing to be criminals,
[2:54:53.080 --> 2:54:59.080]  but it's another thing to just think that criminality is so good and is so honorable
[2:54:59.080 --> 2:55:01.080]  that you just do it out on the open.
[2:55:01.080 --> 2:55:13.080]  I mean, Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura, Martin Sheen, Michael Moore, Amy Goodman, George Carlin.
[2:55:13.080 --> 2:55:18.080]  Those are some of the, quote, good guys interviewed in this film about 9-11 million inside job,
[2:55:18.080 --> 2:55:23.080]  and then Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, John McCain being confronted repeatedly,
[2:55:23.080 --> 2:55:28.080]  John Edwards, Mitt Romney.
[2:55:28.080 --> 2:55:30.080]  I mean, they're all in this film.
[2:55:30.080 --> 2:55:32.080]  Number one, it's an entertaining film.
[2:55:32.080 --> 2:55:36.080]  It's perfect to wake people up with the fact of who the 9-11 Truth movement is,
[2:55:36.080 --> 2:55:39.080]  how they're trying to demonize this, how they're trying to set us up.
[2:55:39.080 --> 2:55:43.080]  I get arrested in it, high-quality, up-close footage of what happened in New York,
[2:55:43.080 --> 2:55:45.080]  Geraldo flipping us off.
[2:55:45.080 --> 2:55:48.080]  It's just a crazy film, and it gets under the bombs in the buildings
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:50.080]  and the key evidence of control demolition,
[2:55:50.080 --> 2:55:52.080]  but that's about 20% of it.
[2:55:52.080 --> 2:55:56.080]  About 20% is the first responders in the deadly dust to cover up there.
[2:55:56.080 --> 2:55:58.080]  The rest is the 9-11 Truth movement and who we are.
[2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:00.080]  It's just such an incredible film.
[2:56:00.080 --> 2:56:03.080]  I'm so proud of Truth Rising.
[2:56:03.080 --> 2:56:05.080]  I know a lot of you probably saw it on PrisonPlanet.tv,
[2:56:05.080 --> 2:56:07.080]  but this is an important film.
[2:56:07.080 --> 2:56:09.080]  Get it on DVD at infoawards.com today,

[2:56:39.080 --> 2:56:42.080]  I want to thank all the members to PrisonPlanet.tv.

[2:56:54.080 --> 2:56:56.080]  or PrisonPlanet.com.
[2:56:56.080 --> 2:57:00.080]  You can also write to me. I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar,
[2:57:00.080 --> 2:57:05.080]  Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[2:57:05.080 --> 2:57:08.080]  By the way, I've got a bunch of business stuff I'm taking care of.
[2:57:08.080 --> 2:57:11.080]  I won't be here tomorrow. Jason Bermas is going to be sitting in,
[2:57:11.080 --> 2:57:14.080]  finally found somebody, have other people sat in on a great job too,
[2:57:14.080 --> 2:57:16.080]  but Bermas is the best, I think, at it.
[2:57:16.080 --> 2:57:18.080]  He'll be here Friday and on the Sunday show.
[2:57:18.080 --> 2:57:20.080]  I'll be back live next Monday.
[2:57:20.080 --> 2:57:23.080]  About fourth hour straight ahead with Jimmy Justice for 30 Minutes
[2:57:23.080 --> 2:57:25.080]  and then more of your calls and then we have loaded phones.
[2:57:25.080 --> 2:57:28.080]  Bunch of other news I haven't even gotten to as well,
[2:57:28.080 --> 2:57:32.080]  but again, 888-253-3139 to call and get my films and books
[2:57:32.080 --> 2:57:34.080]  and the books and videos we carry.
[2:57:34.080 --> 2:57:36.080]  Every order gets a free Citizen Rulebook.
[2:57:36.080 --> 2:57:38.080]  The big orders get multiple copies.
[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:41.080]  infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[2:57:41.080 --> 2:57:43.080]  We'll be right back with a fourth hour.
[2:57:46.080 --> 2:57:48.080]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:57:50.080 --> 2:57:53.080]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:57:57.080]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[2:57:57.080 --> 2:58:00.080]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide,
[2:58:00.080 --> 2:58:03.080]  but in Liberty's darkest hour there is hope.
[2:58:03.080 --> 2:58:06.080]  For the first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:58:06.080 --> 2:58:08.080]  It is essential that patriots worldwide
[2:58:08.080 --> 2:58:12.080]  accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:58:12.080 --> 2:58:16.080]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[2:58:16.080 --> 2:58:17.080]  In the Info War,
[2:58:17.080 --> 2:58:21.080]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
[2:58:21.080 --> 2:58:24.080]  PrisonPlanet.tv is a vault of forbidden information.
[2:58:24.080 --> 2:58:34.080]  All 18 of my documentary films can be downloaded or streamed in super high quality.
[2:58:40.080 --> 2:58:45.080]  We are live at PrisonPlanet.tv on the internet video stream.
[2:58:45.080 --> 2:58:47.080]  Your phone call is coming up later in the hour.
[2:58:47.080 --> 2:58:49.080]  A ton of important news.
[2:58:49.080 --> 2:58:54.080]  We are scheduled to have a fellow named Jimmy Justice on who goes up to police.
[2:58:54.080 --> 2:58:59.080]  Especially traffic enforcement cops that write you a ticket for anything if you sit on a bench too long.
[2:58:59.080 --> 2:59:02.080]  They write you a ticket, they treat the public like total scum in New York.
[2:59:02.080 --> 2:59:04.080]  Same thing in D.C. I've witnessed it.
[2:59:04.080 --> 2:59:06.080]  There will be a building on fire.
[2:59:06.080 --> 2:59:09.080]  They pull up, block the fire hydrant, get out, nobody cares.
[2:59:09.080 --> 2:59:12.080]  They break all the laws, they do whatever they want.
[2:59:12.080 --> 2:59:15.080]  And not just what he's going after the cops for,
[2:59:15.080 --> 2:59:18.080]  but what all of you can do as little Jimmy Justices.
[2:59:18.080 --> 2:59:20.080]  I've got friends that have, for five, six years,
[2:59:20.080 --> 2:59:22.080]  rig your cars like the Batmobile,
[2:59:22.080 --> 2:59:24.080]  a little camera pods and digital recorders.
[2:59:24.080 --> 2:59:27.080]  Usually we'd have VHSs under the seat,
[2:59:27.080 --> 2:59:29.080]  drive around recording them, go out.
[2:59:29.080 --> 2:59:31.080]  It's like hunting, but peacefully.
[2:59:31.080 --> 2:59:33.080]  It's fun to stake the cops out.
[2:59:33.080 --> 2:59:35.080]  Start following the police, start videotaping them.
[2:59:35.080 --> 2:59:40.080]  I mean, let's keep them, they want to surveil us, we're going to surveil them.
[2:59:40.080 --> 2:59:43.080]  Let's keep them to a higher standard, not a lower one.
[2:59:43.080 --> 2:59:47.080]  Here is some audio, the video is up on infowars.com
[2:59:47.080 --> 2:59:50.080]  of Jimmy Justices with this traffic enforcement cop lady.
[2:59:50.080 --> 2:59:52.080]  And there's videos where they'll start threatening to arrest him.
[2:59:52.080 --> 2:59:53.080]  He goes, go ahead.
[2:59:53.080 --> 2:59:55.080]  This is where he really gets heated,
[2:59:55.080 --> 2:59:57.080]  because there's a building on fire outside,
[2:59:57.080 --> 2:59:59.080]  and she pulls up and blocks the fire hydrant
[2:59:59.080 --> 3:00:01.080]  while she's inside eating a sandwich. Here it is.
[3:00:01.080 --> 3:00:03.080]  Are you on drugs?
[3:00:03.080 --> 3:00:04.080]  What is your problem?
[3:00:04.080 --> 3:00:06.080]  You're a traffic enforcement agent,
[3:00:06.080 --> 3:00:10.080]  and you parked your official vehicle blocking a fire pump,
[3:00:10.080 --> 3:00:13.080]  and there's a fire outside with firemen out there,
[3:00:13.080 --> 3:00:15.080]  and they have no access to the pump.
[3:00:15.080 --> 3:00:18.080]  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[3:00:18.080 --> 3:00:20.080]  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[3:00:20.080 --> 3:00:23.080]  While you're in the store, you don't hear the sirens?
[3:00:23.080 --> 3:00:26.080]  What's the matter with you?
[3:00:26.080 --> 3:00:28.080]  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[3:00:28.080 --> 3:00:33.080]  You're supposed to enforce the law and not break the law.
[3:00:33.080 --> 3:00:37.080]  What's the matter with you?
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:40.080]  Don't you think there's something wrong with blocking a fire hydrant?
[3:00:40.080 --> 3:00:43.080]  Don't you think there's something wrong about filming somebody?
[3:00:43.080 --> 3:00:46.080]  I think you're a police officer who's supposed to enforce the law,
[3:00:46.080 --> 3:00:50.080]  but you violated the law by parking your official police car
[3:00:50.080 --> 3:00:52.080]  blocking a fire pump.
[3:00:52.080 --> 3:00:54.080]  Somebody else would get a ticket for that.
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:00:56.080]  What's wrong with you?
[3:00:56.080 --> 3:00:58.080]  What's wrong with you?
[3:01:03.080 --> 3:01:05.080]  T-D-U-L-A.
[3:01:05.080 --> 3:01:07.080]  Carl, what are you doing?
[3:01:07.080 --> 3:01:09.080]  Move away from the vehicle.
[3:01:09.080 --> 3:01:12.080]  I'm filming you breaking the law.
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:14.080]  Ms. Dula, you broke the law.
[3:01:14.080 --> 3:01:15.080]  Thank you, sir.
[3:01:15.080 --> 3:01:16.080]  You broke the law.
[3:01:16.080 --> 3:01:17.080]  Thank you.
[3:01:17.080 --> 3:01:19.080]  What are you going to do? Bite me with your gold tooth?
[3:01:19.080 --> 3:01:22.080]  I'm going to call 311 and I'm going to file a report against you.
[3:01:22.080 --> 3:01:23.080]  You just do that.
[3:01:23.080 --> 3:01:25.080]  Right, but you just broke the law.
[3:01:25.080 --> 3:01:26.080]  I have all right to do it, okay?
[3:01:26.080 --> 3:01:27.080]  I'm going to do that.
[3:01:27.080 --> 3:01:28.080]  Thank you.
[3:01:28.080 --> 3:01:29.080]  And I have it on video.
[3:01:29.080 --> 3:01:30.080]  Thank you.
[3:01:30.080 --> 3:01:31.080]  Oh, thank you.
[3:01:31.080 --> 3:01:32.080]  Thank you.
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:33.080]  You made my day.
[3:01:33.080 --> 3:01:34.080]  You made mine too.
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:35.080]  Thank you.
[3:01:35.080 --> 3:01:36.080]  Okay, bye-bye.
[3:01:36.080 --> 3:01:42.080]  I tell you what, back that audio up again to the start because we're playing the video
[3:01:42.080 --> 3:01:44.080]  at the same time here from the studio.
[3:01:44.080 --> 3:01:46.080]  Back it up to where he's in the store yelling at her.
[3:01:46.080 --> 3:01:50.080]  We'll put the video up on screen where she's blocked the fire hydrant while there's a fire
[3:01:50.080 --> 3:01:51.080]  across the street.
[3:01:51.080 --> 3:01:53.080]  And the fire trucks cannot pull in.
[3:01:53.080 --> 3:01:56.080]  They're all backed up trying to get parked to the water.
[3:01:56.080 --> 3:01:57.080]  Here it is.
[3:01:57.080 --> 3:01:58.080]  Are you on drugs?
[3:01:58.080 --> 3:01:59.080]  What is your problem?
[3:01:59.080 --> 3:02:05.080]  You're a traffic enforcement agent and you parked your official vehicle blocking a fire pump
[3:02:05.080 --> 3:02:10.080]  and there's a fire outside with firemen out there and they have no access to the pump.
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:13.080]  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[3:02:13.080 --> 3:02:17.080]  You ought to be ashamed of yourself while you're in the store.
[3:02:17.080 --> 3:02:19.080]  You don't hear the sirens.
[3:02:19.080 --> 3:02:21.080]  What's the matter with you?
[3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:24.080]  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[3:02:24.080 --> 3:02:29.080]  You're supposed to enforce the law and not break the law.
[3:02:29.080 --> 3:02:33.080]  What's the matter with you?
[3:02:33.080 --> 3:02:36.080]  Don't you think there's something wrong with blocking a fire hydrant?
[3:02:36.080 --> 3:02:38.080]  Don't you think it's not the rule about filming somebody?
[3:02:38.080 --> 3:02:39.080]  No.
[3:02:39.080 --> 3:02:44.080]  I think you're a police officer who's supposed to enforce the law but you violated the law
[3:02:44.080 --> 3:02:48.080]  by parking your official police car blocking a fire pump.
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:50.080]  Somebody else will get a ticket for that.
[3:02:50.080 --> 3:02:51.080]  What's wrong with you?
[3:02:51.080 --> 3:02:59.080]  What's wrong with you?
[3:02:59.080 --> 3:03:07.080]  I'm filming you breaking the law.
[3:03:07.080 --> 3:03:10.080]  There's scores of these videos.
[3:03:10.080 --> 3:03:12.080]  Hey, you're not above the law.
[3:03:12.080 --> 3:03:15.080]  You're not God because you get a badge and a gun.
[3:03:15.080 --> 3:03:17.080]  Same thing for mayors and everybody else.
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:19.080]  You're not above the law and we're sick of it.
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:20.080]  You want to surveil us?
[3:03:20.080 --> 3:03:22.080]  We're declaring war right back on you.
[3:03:22.080 --> 3:03:23.080]  The bad cops.
[3:03:23.080 --> 3:03:24.080]  We'll be right back.
[3:03:24.080 --> 3:03:33.080]  Come on, all of you, come hounds!
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:43.080]  Come on, black girls, get out and get lined up.
[3:03:43.080 --> 3:03:46.080]  Don't buy us God's yeah!
[3:03:46.080 --> 3:03:48.080]  Hey, you're not above the law!
[3:03:48.080 --> 3:03:50.080]  Those of you that are living in that school,
[3:03:50.080 --> 3:03:54.720]  gun. Same thing for mayors and everybody else. You're not above the law and we're sick of it.
[3:03:54.720 --> 3:03:59.760]  You want to surveil us? We're declaring war right back on you. The bad cops. We'll be right back.
[3:04:06.320 --> 3:04:11.440]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages
[3:04:11.440 --> 3:04:15.760]  already destroying millions of American families. Wheat for flour is already four times more
[3:04:15.760 --> 3:04:20.800]  expensive than it was about a year ago. Food costs continue to double because there's no food

[3:06:07.280 --> 3:06:12.640]  hundreds of my fellow troops I went to ground here and we knew what to do. Or at least we thought
[3:06:12.640 --> 3:06:18.640]  we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[3:06:18.640 --> 3:06:28.240]  to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director on the AG made a statement that the air was safe
[3:06:28.240 --> 3:06:34.720]  to breathe. This film follows the growing mix of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[3:06:34.720 --> 3:06:39.600]  network. We're going to be talking to Jimmy Justice here in a moment. He's a model for all of us.
[3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:45.120]  He goes out predominantly with traffic enforcement police where there'll be a building on fire
[3:06:45.120 --> 3:06:48.320]  and they'll just pull up park in front of a fire hydrant walk in to get a hamburger.
[3:06:49.920 --> 3:06:53.440]  We all see police break traffic laws not when they're in hot pursuit with their sirens on
[3:06:53.440 --> 3:06:56.800]  but just do whatever they want. But if you did that they'd arrest you for reckless driving.
[3:06:56.800 --> 3:07:02.080]  The police are, well the department likes what he's doing this day on the service. The police
[3:07:02.080 --> 3:07:06.640]  union doesn't like it. They'd defend anything which is stupid by having lower standards than
[3:07:06.640 --> 3:07:10.640]  police act bad. Then it gives you all bad names. So you ought to be thanking Jimmy Justice for
[3:07:10.640 --> 3:07:14.960]  what he's doing. But not just with this, with police brutality, with police corruption,
[3:07:15.840 --> 3:07:20.160]  with police violating procedures in the Constitution Bill of Rights, video cameras are a
[3:07:20.160 --> 3:07:26.000]  weapon of the Info War and Liberty that we can turn back against them. Now here is an ABC news piece
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:31.280]  that was done about Jimmy Justice. We're going to play part of this and then comment on it
[3:07:31.280 --> 3:07:36.880]  and go to Jimmy Justice. Here it is. Thanks for watching today's I Caught. I'm Bianca
[3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:41.760]  Rodrigo. We all hate that dreaded feeling when you walk up to your car and you see a bright
[3:07:41.760 --> 3:07:46.720]  orange parking ticket under your windshield wiper. You may have actually just been in to get a cup
[3:07:46.720 --> 3:07:51.200]  of coffee for five minutes. Say you think to yourself, you know, cops are only doing their
[3:07:51.200 --> 3:07:56.400]  job. They're patrolling the streets. But what happens when you see a cop doing the same thing
[3:07:56.400 --> 3:08:01.200]  you actually got a ticket for? One average Joe in Brooklyn decided to whip out his camera and see
[3:08:01.200 --> 3:08:06.480]  if he could catch any cops in the act. Are you embarrassed that you broke the law? I didn't think
[3:08:06.480 --> 3:08:13.360]  that you parked in a bus stop. Look, the buses can't get through, can they? Because of you,
[3:08:13.360 --> 3:08:17.840]  why couldn't you pull in over there? You're blocking traffic on a major avenue. You're not
[3:08:17.840 --> 3:08:24.800]  allowed to do that. He has a mouth. Are you on drugs? He has a camera. Move away from the vehicle.
[3:08:24.800 --> 3:08:29.840]  I'm filming you breaking the law. Why are you double parked? And if you wear a badge, he may
[3:08:29.840 --> 3:08:36.560]  have you all over the web. You broke the law and I got it on video tape. I'm Jimmy Justice
[3:08:36.560 --> 3:08:43.520]  and your days of running around the city like a cowboy are over. He cruises the streets to catch
[3:08:43.520 --> 3:08:48.480]  New York City traffic cops behaving badly and when he locks on a target, he posts it on the
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:55.040]  internet for the world to see. In this clip, Jimmy spots a traffic agent parked illegally at a fire
[3:08:55.040 --> 3:09:02.720]  hydrant during a fire. You're a traffic enforcement agent and you parked your official vehicle
[3:09:02.720 --> 3:09:08.400]  blocking a fire pump and there's a fire outside with firemen out there and they have no access
[3:09:08.400 --> 3:09:13.200]  to the pump. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. You're supposed to enforce the law and not break
[3:09:13.200 --> 3:09:17.920]  the law. It's pretty gutsy. You walk right up to these police officers and some say you don't
[3:09:17.920 --> 3:09:22.240]  always show them the greatest amount of respect. I will only show respect to a police officer
[3:09:22.240 --> 3:09:27.360]  who does his job properly. It's a no standing anytime zone. Here, it's a board of education worker.
[3:09:27.360 --> 3:09:32.480]  You're part of a sidewalk. It gets ugly. Jimmy's already on his third camera. Let me get out of my
[3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:38.320]  face, man. It's the least that we can ask that the same people that are out there to enforce
[3:09:38.320 --> 3:09:44.720]  the parking and the traffic laws obey the laws themselves. This new video revolution, he says,
[3:09:44.720 --> 3:09:49.680]  levels the playing field, giving the average Joe, or Jimmy, a chance to fight back against the
[3:09:49.680 --> 3:09:56.080]  power players. You parked in a no standing... And it seems to work. The NYPD has launched a full
[3:09:56.080 --> 3:10:01.680]  investigation into the officers caught on tape. Don't spit on me. Don't spit on me. I have to
[3:10:01.680 --> 3:10:07.520]  do what I want. Jimmy Justice won't reveal his real name, afraid of revenge by the city, but
[3:10:07.520 --> 3:10:12.800]  like most internet warriors, there was a single moment that sent him over the edge. Last year,
[3:10:12.800 --> 3:10:18.320]  I witnessed a traffic enforcement agent give somebody a ticket for parking blocking a fire
[3:10:18.320 --> 3:10:22.880]  hydrant and then the same traffic enforcement agent got back in his official vehicle. He made
[3:10:22.880 --> 3:10:27.280]  a U-turn. He blocked a different fire hydrant on the other side of the street and went to a
[3:10:27.280 --> 3:10:32.800]  restaurant to eat lunch. The NYPD says that they've launched an investigation into the matter and
[3:10:32.800 --> 3:10:40.480]  it's unknown yet if anyone has been disciplined. Okay, we bring you now to the man, Jimmy Justice.
[3:10:40.480 --> 3:10:44.800]  Jimmy, if more Americans do what you're doing, something we've been doing for years, this is
[3:10:44.800 --> 3:10:50.800]  our exact type of tactic to show the hypocrisy. A lot of corruption and double standards are
[3:10:50.800 --> 3:10:55.440]  going to come to an end. I commend you, Jimmy Justice. All right, thank you. First, I want to
[3:10:55.440 --> 3:11:00.320]  say that it's an honor to be invited on your show. Thank you very much for calling and contacting me.
[3:11:00.320 --> 3:11:07.040]  And I agree with you. The more video cameras out there, it's going to be much harder for the police
[3:11:07.040 --> 3:11:12.080]  to do something wrong. And we need to put video cameras out, not just to keep an eye on the public,
[3:11:12.080 --> 3:11:18.000]  but also to keep an eye on the watchers. What made you do this? When did you start doing this?
[3:11:19.280 --> 3:11:25.360]  Well, I work as an audio systems engineer and here in New York City. And I also play guitar
[3:11:25.360 --> 3:11:30.560]  in a rock band. And in a lot of places, there are no standing zones, but according to the law,
[3:11:30.560 --> 3:11:36.640]  you're allowed to stop temporarily to drop off a passenger or to drop off your cargo,
[3:11:36.640 --> 3:11:41.600]  and then you have to move along and park properly. And often I pull up in front of a club to unload
[3:11:41.600 --> 3:11:45.600]  my guitar and my gear, and then I'm going to run back into my car and leave. And I'm allowed to do
[3:11:45.600 --> 3:11:50.000]  that according to New York City traffic rules. But often they just come up and they write you a
[3:11:50.000 --> 3:11:55.040]  ticket anyway and go and argue with them. They're a bunch of mindless, illiterate drones. They don't
[3:11:55.040 --> 3:12:00.000]  even know the laws that they're enforcing because they openly flout those same laws while they're
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:04.240]  running their personal errands. Well, that's a good way to put it. I mean, New York police on
[3:12:04.240 --> 3:12:10.240]  average treat the citizens like they are maggot droppings. I mean, they are just out of control.
[3:12:10.880 --> 3:12:14.960]  And so that's how this started is you're giving them some of their own medicine now.
[3:12:15.840 --> 3:12:20.080]  Yeah. Now, absolutely. Now, sometimes if I would be getting paid a hundred dollars
[3:12:20.080 --> 3:12:24.480]  to play guitar to show, and I would get a ticket for a hundred and fifteen dollars,
[3:12:24.480 --> 3:12:29.840]  it would cost me money to go and do this. And these things have this anger has been building
[3:12:29.840 --> 3:12:35.920]  up in me for a long time. And about two years ago, I witnessed a traffic enforcement agent
[3:12:36.640 --> 3:12:41.360]  write a civilian summits for parking parking. Let me stop you, Jimmy. They've started this
[3:12:41.360 --> 3:12:46.160]  in the last 10 years. They're civilians, too. We're not in the Marshall Law dictatorship.
[3:12:46.160 --> 3:12:50.960]  Mayors call us civilians. They're all civilians, too. They're not a military occupying force,
[3:12:50.960 --> 3:12:57.280]  even if they say they are criminally. Go ahead. Right. And just to make a differentiation to
[3:12:57.280 --> 3:13:02.320]  your listeners, in New York City, the police department, the actual guys with guns and arresting
[3:13:02.320 --> 3:13:08.800]  powers are called the NYPD. And the traffic enforcement agency is a civilian arm of the NYPD.
[3:13:08.800 --> 3:13:11.840]  But the NYPD civilian, too, sir. They're not a military. Go ahead.
[3:13:11.840 --> 3:13:16.480]  Okay. I just, we all use that term. We need to stop using it. Go ahead.
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:20.960]  Okay. My point was, though, that the traffic enforcement agency has even less training
[3:13:20.960 --> 3:13:25.440]  than an actual NYPD police officer. They don't have arresting powers. They don't carry a gun.
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:32.560]  It's their sole job to help the flow of traffic go more smoothly and to write parking summits.
[3:13:33.120 --> 3:13:36.800]  And, boy, do they do their job with this viciousness toward the public.
[3:13:36.800 --> 3:13:43.200]  And New York City has a policy of predatory ticketing. And I believe that when traffic law
[3:13:43.200 --> 3:13:48.080]  was originally written, there was a degree of altruism. And these laws were written to increase
[3:13:48.080 --> 3:13:52.720]  public safety for motorists and for pedestrians. But it isn't that way anymore.
[3:13:52.720 --> 3:13:58.880]  Cities, especially New York City, are using these traffic laws as a means of raising revenue.
[3:13:58.880 --> 3:14:04.080]  And here in New York City, they write about 15 million parking tickets per year, and it brings
[3:14:04.080 --> 3:14:10.560]  in $500 million into the city coffers. And it's an outright disgrace. And what hurts a lot more
[3:14:10.560 --> 3:14:14.880]  than receiving a parking ticket, especially if you believe you didn't deserve one, is watching
[3:14:14.880 --> 3:14:19.840]  the same officer who gave you that ticket, committing the same violation with his official vehicle.
[3:14:22.240 --> 3:14:26.160]  Amazing. Now, how are they responding to you when they see you on the street now? I mean,
[3:14:26.160 --> 3:14:30.480]  you're pretty bold. You're polite in most of the videos, but when there was actually a fire going
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:33.680]  on, you really got in her face, you could tell that you were, you were outraged by it. And they
[3:14:33.680 --> 3:14:39.280]  get these self-satisfied, you know what, eating grins, you know, like it's a big joke. Some of
[3:14:39.280 --> 3:14:44.240]  them threaten you, some of them break your cameras. I mean, are you starting to get heat over this?
[3:14:47.040 --> 3:14:52.160]  Yeah, I'm getting some heat from the police department and from the union that represents
[3:14:52.160 --> 3:14:58.160]  the Traffic Enforcement Agency. And Keith Richberg just wrote an article about me in the Washington
[3:14:58.160 --> 3:15:02.720]  Post this week, where he quotes James Huntley, who is the president of the Traffic Enforcement
[3:15:02.720 --> 3:15:07.360]  Agency union, who said that they are pressing a case against me for harassment and trying
[3:15:07.360 --> 3:15:11.360]  to get me arrested. And I'm saying this is unbelievable. You were there showing them
[3:15:11.360 --> 3:15:16.080]  break the law, hypocrites, giving someone a ticket and then going and parking illegally
[3:15:16.080 --> 3:15:21.280]  five seconds later. And to them in their warped view, there's big editorials and news pieces
[3:15:21.280 --> 3:15:26.080]  saying, Jimmy, justice is bad. I mean, this is insane. So now they want to get you quote for
[3:15:26.080 --> 3:15:34.640]  harassment for talking to the gods, but the gods, they want to harass us. Yeah. And they just passed
[3:15:34.640 --> 3:15:40.800]  a new law that was signed by Governor Patterson in New York that makes it a class eighth felony
[3:15:40.800 --> 3:15:47.040]  to assault the Traffic Enforcement Agency punishable by seven years in jail. If one citizen here in
[3:15:47.040 --> 3:15:51.200]  New York would punch another citizen in the face, they might get six months or a year in jail,
[3:15:51.200 --> 3:15:56.400]  but do the same thing to a traffic enforcement agent. And now you're facing seven years.
[3:15:56.400 --> 3:16:02.560]  By the way, these are the people who, who's the top 60 minutes guy. He interviews all the world
[3:16:02.560 --> 3:16:08.400]  leaders Wallace. What's his Wallace, Mike Wallace. Remember, they beat him up and beat his driver
[3:16:08.400 --> 3:16:13.600]  up and it all came out in court. Oh yeah, I've a faint recollection of that. No, no, that was
[3:16:13.600 --> 3:16:19.920]  about three years ago. That was traffic enforcement. Oh, right. Yes, that's right. He was coming
[3:16:19.920 --> 3:16:25.760]  in a taxi to, to his studio and he and they said the taxi couldn't stop and let him out. Yeah.
[3:16:26.880 --> 3:16:32.240]  Yeah, which even if it was a no standing zone, the taxi is permitted to drop off your passenger
[3:16:32.240 --> 3:16:36.400]  and then you have to keep going. So he argued with the traffic cop and they, they punched him
[3:16:36.400 --> 3:16:41.760]  out and then they had him arrested. Yeah, let me tell you about New York folks. You'll be
[3:16:41.760 --> 3:16:46.400]  standing on a huge sidewalk walking no one with a video camera out, not even talking and a couple
[3:16:46.400 --> 3:16:51.440]  walk around and go, what's you doing? And you'll say, well, I'm just here getting some shots.
[3:16:51.440 --> 3:16:55.920]  You got some permit for it. Listen here, Mac. Listen to me. Don't you talk back to me. I'll
[3:16:55.920 --> 3:17:01.040]  take you to jail right now. We have video of that in martial law. And I'm told this only
[3:17:01.040 --> 3:17:06.000]  started in the last 10 years. What's wrong with these people? Yeah, I mean, they tried to intimidate
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:11.440]  me. And the first thing a police officer would say is, let me see your ID as if I'm supposed to
[3:17:11.440 --> 3:17:18.880]  just shrivel up and melt because he's asking me. This is my slave there, boy. I will not let
[3:17:19.760 --> 3:17:23.600]  something like that intimidate me. I know that I'm right. What do you say to this?
[3:17:24.240 --> 3:17:27.600]  What do you say to the paramilitary forces when they demand your slave card?
[3:17:29.760 --> 3:17:35.120]  What? Your ID card, your slave card. What do you do when they demand the ID?
[3:17:35.120 --> 3:17:42.240]  I try not to show it to them because I don't want them to know my real name. Jimmy Justice is a
[3:17:42.240 --> 3:17:46.240]  pseudonym. I picked this name because it sounds like, give me justice. And that's what I'm all about.
[3:17:46.800 --> 3:17:52.720]  Evening and reveling the playing field. If they knew my real name, they can come to my house when
[3:17:52.720 --> 3:17:56.240]  I'm not there to defend myself and just ride a hundred parking tickets on my car.
[3:17:59.040 --> 3:18:03.040]  All right, we come back. Stay there, Jimmy Justice. We come back. I have an idea
[3:18:03.040 --> 3:18:10.640]  forming in my head about what we need to do. We need to create Jimmy Justice squads, ladies and
[3:18:10.640 --> 3:18:16.080]  gentlemen, in every major city and keep putting them on YouTube, Google, put them on local access,
[3:18:16.080 --> 3:18:21.040]  show them the local news. They don't like it. Well, let's, let's intensify what we're doing.
[3:18:21.680 --> 3:18:27.120]  We don't like being traded like third world slaves either. So now you're going to get your own medicine.
[3:18:27.120 --> 3:18:34.480]  It is a big idea. A new world order. In the near future,
[3:18:35.200 --> 3:18:40.160]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government. It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:18:41.120 --> 3:18:46.480]  Is that their objective being world domination? For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:18:47.120 --> 3:18:53.920]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[3:18:53.920 --> 3:19:01.360]  is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government
[3:19:01.360 --> 3:19:06.800]  is blown wide open. You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:19:06.800 --> 3:19:10.560]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government. Most people have no idea.
[3:19:10.560 --> 3:19:13.920]  They're not after money. They have all the money they need. They're after power. That's their

[3:19:28.960 --> 3:19:33.760]  Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out
[3:19:33.760 --> 3:19:39.920]  their golden years. Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical,
[3:19:39.920 --> 3:19:45.040]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line. Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our
[3:19:45.040 --> 3:19:50.080]  monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation
[3:19:50.080 --> 3:19:54.720]  and higher taxes? These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book,
[3:19:54.720 --> 3:19:59.360]  The Creature from Jekyll Island. Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to
[3:19:59.360 --> 3:20:04.960]  know about central bank power. A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking

[3:21:30.000 --> 3:21:34.800]  droughts, tsunamis, floods, fires and hurricanes have killed over 1 million people worldwide and
[3:21:34.800 --> 3:21:39.360]  forced tens of millions to go without food and water. After Katrina, the media was eager to show
[3:21:39.360 --> 3:21:43.680]  victims in New Orleans begging for food. If a disaster strikes you and your loved ones and you
[3:21:43.680 --> 3:21:48.640]  have no stored food, you'll be begging as well. Now our economy is slipping into an abyss that
[3:21:48.640 --> 3:21:53.120]  even Donald Trump says will make the Great Depression look like a Sunday picnic. The U.S.
[3:21:53.120 --> 3:21:58.160]  dollars were less today than it was even last week before food prices skyrocketed. Okay,

[3:22:26.480 --> 3:22:35.040]  Take a look at your window, babe. There's a scene you'd like to catch.
[3:22:35.040 --> 3:22:58.000]  Jimmy Justice. Jimmy, what do you think of the idea of people not even meeting with you,
[3:22:58.000 --> 3:23:04.080]  but just taking the idea? We do similar things for years, but I like your idea of showing them
[3:23:04.080 --> 3:23:09.760]  breaking petty laws, regulations. Still very serious because of the hypocritical nature.
[3:23:10.400 --> 3:23:15.040]  And more people in New York City doing this. And folks, that means if you're looking at your
[3:23:15.040 --> 3:23:18.640]  window and see a cop parked in front of a fire hydrant, you videotape it, you don't have to
[3:23:18.640 --> 3:23:21.440]  walk up to them or you could walk up and say, why are you parked in front of that fire hydrant,
[3:23:21.440 --> 3:23:25.680]  but you give me a ticket. You know, now the pregnant woman stops and it's been in the news,
[3:23:25.680 --> 3:23:30.400]  sits on a bench too long. They give you a ticket. You're screamed at, you're yelled at. DC was just
[3:23:30.400 --> 3:23:34.720]  as bad. It's all about letting you know you work for them. You are scum. You are a slave.
[3:23:35.520 --> 3:23:39.040]  Jimmy Justice, what about more people across the country doing what you've done? Do you like that
[3:23:39.040 --> 3:23:44.480]  idea? I love that idea. And there are many reasons why I started to make these videos and exhibit
[3:23:44.480 --> 3:23:49.760]  them on YouTube for the public to see. First of all, I want the public to be entertained.
[3:23:50.400 --> 3:23:54.960]  I also want the police officers who record a video behaving badly to be embarrassed. And I want
[3:23:54.960 --> 3:24:00.000]  other police officers to know that at any moment somebody could pop out from behind a tree with
[3:24:00.000 --> 3:24:04.800]  a video camera. So they should think twice before they abuse their authority. And I also
[3:24:04.800 --> 3:24:10.480]  wanted to inspire copycats because I can't be all over New York City and I can't be in every
[3:24:10.480 --> 3:24:16.720]  city at the same time. And I ask everybody to go out pick up a video camera or if you have to buy
[3:24:16.720 --> 3:24:22.800]  a new cell phone, get one with a video function. But at the same time, I warn you to not interfere
[3:24:22.800 --> 3:24:28.480]  with police activity. Don't get up in their face. Don't be threatening and never put a hand on them.
[3:24:28.480 --> 3:24:32.960]  Do you remember Mayor Bloomberg? Or yeah, they'll beat you up and say you attacked them.
[3:24:32.960 --> 3:24:36.480]  Remember when Mayor Bloomberg 60 anybody get hurt or arrested? Yeah, because these are dangerous
[3:24:36.480 --> 3:24:41.600]  people. Remember six months ago, when Bloomberg said I'm banning videotaping in the city and
[3:24:41.600 --> 3:24:44.960]  then he wasn't able to do that. I mean, they want to put cameras on us, but then we're not
[3:24:44.960 --> 3:24:48.400]  allowed to have cameras on them. Violates the First Amendment. More of this tyranny. Do you
[3:24:48.400 --> 3:24:55.360]  remember that? Yeah, that's just a lot of bull. That's another double standard. Do you know that
[3:24:55.360 --> 3:25:00.720]  in England, they made a proposal to the police department that there should be video cameras
[3:25:00.720 --> 3:25:04.880]  on your guns, which would start recording automatically whenever the police officer
[3:25:04.880 --> 3:25:10.160]  would pull his gun out of the holster. And in this way, if the police officer ever had to
[3:25:10.880 --> 3:25:16.560]  shoot his gun, it would be videotaped to show that he that it was proper or improper for him
[3:25:16.560 --> 3:25:21.680]  to do that. And the police were fighting this. And I couldn't understand why. Why, why wouldn't
[3:25:21.680 --> 3:25:26.640]  they want it videoed unless they have something to hide? Well, I don't even want to start
[3:25:26.640 --> 3:25:30.240]  surveilling them that way because then that'll roll down hill onto us like they track cops with
[3:25:30.240 --> 3:25:34.480]  GPS in their cars now. And you know, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. I want my
[3:25:34.480 --> 3:25:38.960]  freedom. I want them to have their freedom, but I'm all for citizens under their First Amendment
[3:25:38.960 --> 3:25:43.120]  videotaping them when they're doing something wrong. Tell folks about your YouTube channel.
[3:25:44.400 --> 3:25:51.360]  Yeah, so if people want to go to Jimmyjustice.net, it'll be bounced to my YouTube channels where
[3:25:51.360 --> 3:25:58.080]  they could watch any of my videos for free. And they could watch me get into the faces of
[3:25:58.080 --> 3:26:04.400]  the traffic enforcement agents here in New York City who openly fill out the exact same laws which
[3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:10.880]  they are paid to enforce. You got a lot of videos up there. Yes. I mean, are they starting to
[3:26:10.880 --> 3:26:16.320]  recognize you when you come up to them or? Oh yeah, they all know me. Sometimes if they see
[3:26:16.320 --> 3:26:22.480]  me coming, they turn and run away. So effectively, I can stop traffic enforcement on an entire city
[3:26:22.480 --> 3:26:26.080]  block. I just spend it with my camera because they will run away and they will go somewhere else.
[3:26:27.680 --> 3:26:31.120]  Sometimes I have to dress differently. Sometimes I'll come, I'll put a fake mustache
[3:26:31.120 --> 3:26:37.440]  on or I'll dress in a suit or you know, weird different style of clothes just so I could
[3:26:37.440 --> 3:26:41.280]  sneak up on them. Recently, I've been doing it at night and it's the first time I've been going
[3:26:41.280 --> 3:26:44.720]  out at night doing it. So they haven't seen that one coming. What other types of things you're
[3:26:44.720 --> 3:26:52.080]  catching on video that Lordships are doing? I see them writing improper tickets, illegal tickets.
[3:26:54.560 --> 3:26:58.480]  I see the way that they harass the public and I see the way that they openly fill out the laws.
[3:26:59.600 --> 3:27:04.080]  And when I confront them on it, I usually come to them nicely and I just stand there with the
[3:27:04.080 --> 3:27:07.680]  camera and I say, officer, you shouldn't be doing that. That's not fair. Someone else get a ticket
[3:27:07.680 --> 3:27:12.800]  for that. And if they show me this attitude as if there's this sense of entitlement that because
[3:27:12.800 --> 3:27:17.520]  they work for the city, they're above the law and they can do whatever they want. That's when I
[3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:23.440]  get all fired up. You got mad at the, you got mad at the traffic enforcer who was in the store
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:28.560]  laughing and smiling at you at first about the fire outside and she's blocking the fire hydrant.
[3:27:28.560 --> 3:27:33.520]  You got pretty mean to her. Yeah, that's what she deserved. Yes, she did deserve that and her
[3:27:33.520 --> 3:27:38.640]  reaction was stereotypical to how the traffic enforcement agency in New York City behaved
[3:27:38.640 --> 3:27:43.040]  and how they treat the public with disdain and how they believe they're entitled to
[3:27:43.040 --> 3:27:48.000]  act above the law. Absolutely. I didn't know there had been a Washington Post article where
[3:27:48.000 --> 3:27:51.360]  they had one of the union people saying that you were the serge criminal. Where is that going?
[3:27:53.360 --> 3:27:57.200]  Well, this article was written on Sunday. I don't know what is going to happen
[3:27:57.760 --> 3:28:01.680]  if I'm going to end up getting arrested or not. It might be naive of me to think
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:06.320]  that they don't actually know my real name and address. I'm sure that they do. I'm certainly
[3:28:06.320 --> 3:28:09.120]  not going to make it easy on them. Stay there. I'm going to come back and take calls folks. We're
[3:28:09.120 --> 3:28:13.200]  going to do a few more minutes with Jimmy Justice. You see videotaping them commit crimes. He needs
[3:28:13.200 --> 3:28:24.960]  to be arrested. That's not good. We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[3:28:24.960 --> 3:28:32.960]  radio network. Wake up Protestant America. There is an ecumenical movement now being planned to
[3:28:32.960 --> 3:28:37.920]  join church and state. This confederation of evangelicals, Catholics and Protestant denominations
[3:28:37.920 --> 3:28:42.640]  will form one huge political voting block. Their agenda is enforcement of religious worship and
[3:28:42.640 --> 3:28:47.440]  morality by legislation. Our forefathers wrote the Bill of Rights to guarantee all Americans this
[3:28:47.440 --> 3:28:51.680]  freedom, liberty of conscience. History and the Bible proved to them that these two systems,
[3:28:51.680 --> 3:28:56.640]  church and state, must be kept separate. It must be our love of God and of country that prompts
[3:28:56.640 --> 3:29:01.520]  or constrains us. This will change the character, not civil enforcement. From history we saw that
[3:29:01.520 --> 3:29:06.400]  when church and state united known as papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted. This union would
[3:29:06.400 --> 3:29:11.440]  go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation. America and papal Rome are uniting in
[3:29:11.440 --> 3:29:16.880]  this agenda. Protestant America, awake before it is too late. The prophecies are fast fulfilling.
[3:29:16.880 --> 3:29:23.840]  Jesus is coming soon for free materials call 888-211-1715 or write the Bible says
[3:29:23.840 --> 3:29:31.440]  Box 99, Lenore City, Tennessee 377-71. May I have everybody's attention please? I've come with a
[3:29:31.440 --> 3:29:37.440]  message of information. 9-11 was an inside job. Do you like being a puppet sir? Do you like being
[3:29:37.440 --> 3:29:41.520]  a puppet for the New World Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage,
[3:29:41.520 --> 3:29:45.600]  was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the fallout or commission, the C.A.R.
[3:29:45.600 --> 3:29:52.400]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of
[3:29:52.400 --> 3:29:57.840]  despotism to grow at our own door. Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[3:29:57.840 --> 3:30:04.400]  a global awakening has taken place. An inside job. How dare you?
[3:30:07.520 --> 3:30:11.120]  If you know that there's treason going on you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:30:11.120 --> 3:30:16.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:19.360]  in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.

[3:31:38.480 --> 3:31:47.440]  Well I love what Jimmy Justice is doing.
[3:31:52.640 --> 3:32:00.480]  And it's just amazing that they're talking about how he needs to be arrested for harassment
[3:32:00.480 --> 3:32:08.400]  for going out and videotaping police breaking the law. But that is your rogue government.
[3:32:11.200 --> 3:32:16.080]  That is what this country in the world is turning into. Well the counterbalance is people like
[3:32:16.080 --> 3:32:21.120]  Jimmy Justice and you out there watching on President Planet TV and listening on the radio
[3:32:21.680 --> 3:32:25.040]  right now. Jimmy's going to leave us here in a few minutes and we'll talk to Michael,
[3:32:25.040 --> 3:32:31.440]  Kevin and others that are patiently holding the toll free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231
[3:32:31.440 --> 3:32:37.680]  on any issue you want to discuss. Jimmy in closing more about how your this arch band
[3:32:37.680 --> 3:32:42.880]  that must be arrested now in the Washington Post and I did pull it up and I mean that just
[3:32:42.880 --> 3:32:50.720]  illustrates the out of touch insanity of your major police departments. Absolutely it does.
[3:32:50.720 --> 3:32:57.760]  It is completely insane and instead of talking about the issue of abuse of authority the president
[3:32:57.760 --> 3:33:03.760]  of the union and the commissioner of the police department want to launch this ad hominem campaign
[3:33:03.760 --> 3:33:10.880]  against me personally and call me a stalker or attempt to have me arrested for harassment.
[3:33:10.880 --> 3:33:13.920]  Oh really? Well then the police are stalking us which is really what a lot of them do.
[3:33:14.480 --> 3:33:19.760]  I mean what's wrong with you videotaping their lordships? I mean if I'm a stalker or standing
[3:33:19.760 --> 3:33:23.680]  around with a video camera and showing the truth about how they abuse their authorities
[3:33:24.240 --> 3:33:28.240]  then what about the meter maids here in New York who stand next to a parking meter that
[3:33:28.240 --> 3:33:33.600]  has five minutes left in it and they are just waiting for that moment that the meter expires
[3:33:33.600 --> 3:33:38.880]  so they could flap a summons onto that person's car. I would think that they're stalking the
[3:33:38.880 --> 3:33:43.440]  person who owns that car. They should be arrested for stalking as well. What's good for the goose
[3:33:43.440 --> 3:33:50.800]  is good for the gander as you said earlier. Anything else you want to add sir? Absolutely.
[3:33:51.440 --> 3:33:58.960]  I just want to add that in the case of blocking a fire hydrant what's the difference
[3:33:59.680 --> 3:34:05.520]  if it's my car or a civilian vehicle or if it's the vehicle of a traffic enforcement agent who
[3:34:05.520 --> 3:34:10.320]  is eating lunch it's a dangerous thing to do. But that's a god you're a civilian slave
[3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:14.320]  and a military dictatorship see when you use their term civilian you're playing into that but
[3:34:14.320 --> 3:34:20.080]  that's what they think go ahead. You're an occupied territory you're an occupied schmo to have to be
[3:34:20.080 --> 3:34:26.320]  sucked off of and nothing more. I believe that the police department and the government relies upon
[3:34:26.320 --> 3:34:32.160]  our ignorance of our rights and that's how they trample over us and I want to ask everybody who's
[3:34:32.160 --> 3:34:37.920]  listening to read the constitution and read all of your local laws and find out how you can fight
[3:34:37.920 --> 3:34:43.440]  back. Don't let the government or the police take over. Everybody is born free and we should remain
[3:34:43.440 --> 3:34:53.600]  that way. All right again jimmyjustice.net is the website you can watch just masses of videos there
[3:34:53.600 --> 3:34:57.360]  and if I was you my friend I'd get some other people to work with you you've gotten enough fame
[3:34:57.360 --> 3:35:03.440]  now I'm sure they'll want to be involved with you and it's also fun and I would uh I would rig a car
[3:35:03.440 --> 3:35:10.320]  with hidden cameras that go into a DVR uh in the uh inside the glove compartment and then and then
[3:35:10.320 --> 3:35:15.120]  rig up microphones inside so when they come and harass you it's even better and then this is it
[3:35:15.120 --> 3:35:21.200]  runs stings against them everywhere and see how they like it. Oh they're not going to like it and
[3:35:21.200 --> 3:35:26.960]  I've had emails from people in the public that support the work that I'm doing and they're talking
[3:35:26.960 --> 3:35:32.320]  about helping me build such a system of hidden cameras so I can get much better video and I'm
[3:35:32.320 --> 3:35:37.200]  going to hopefully soon employ that system into my arsenal. Well you act very confident it's why you
[3:35:37.200 --> 3:35:41.360]  haven't been beaten or killed yet if you really wanted to set them up and you're not setting them
[3:35:41.360 --> 3:35:46.400]  up you would act cowardly and acquiesce to them and then you can have somebody across the street
[3:35:46.400 --> 3:35:49.120]  I mean the first time you do this they're going to probably physically attack you so it's pretty
[3:35:49.120 --> 3:35:54.960]  dangerous and have someone set it up you know in a hidden uh with a hidden camera in a vehicle or
[3:35:54.960 --> 3:36:01.200]  something and then when they come up act scared and go oh yes oh and then that triggers the bully
[3:36:01.200 --> 3:36:05.680]  mentality and then you'll and then you've got them but I don't know that's pretty dangerous
[3:36:05.680 --> 3:36:09.520]  you might just get tazored to death I mean they they call it lighting a person up or four or five
[3:36:09.520 --> 3:36:14.400]  all tazor at the same time and then you start tazoring tazoring till you die it's a big celebration
[3:36:14.400 --> 3:36:21.040]  of death of America and destruction of freedom hmm yeah don't taze me bro yeah I try you don't
[3:36:21.040 --> 3:36:25.920]  ask questions of of a carry even when it's question and answer time or you will be taged in land of
[3:36:25.920 --> 3:36:31.040]  the coward some of the slaves yeah that was so ridiculous what happened to that poor kid well
[3:36:31.040 --> 3:36:34.640]  it's all part of the freedom sir they're not gonna be able to suck the pension funds and destroy the
[3:36:34.640 --> 3:36:38.560]  dollar and steal the whole country unless they're gonna have their minions have their way and that's
[3:36:38.560 --> 3:36:43.120]  why what you're doing so important I know there's cops that aren't evil like this but more and more
[3:36:43.120 --> 3:36:47.280]  are becoming evil and the top people want them to be evil because we have a criminal government
[3:36:47.280 --> 3:36:51.840]  we have to say no to these bullies and these mafia thugs jimmy justice thanks for spending time
[3:36:51.840 --> 3:36:56.320]  with us all right thank you very much for inviting me and have a great day anything else starts criminal
[3:36:56.320 --> 3:37:02.320]  that you want to add um just everybody should go out and buy a digital camcorder
[3:37:03.440 --> 3:37:08.720]  and learn your rights you're allowed to use it and fight back how gracious of them to allow it
[3:37:09.760 --> 3:37:15.520]  I appreciate it take care of my friend yes bye bye good job folks things are way out of whack the
[3:37:15.520 --> 3:37:21.440]  balance of powers way out of whack it's time to stop and I've had you know Austin cops come to me and
[3:37:21.440 --> 3:37:25.040]  when I'm 200 yards away 100 yards away and say turn your camera off don't video tip the checkpoint

[3:37:40.560 --> 3:37:45.280]  the street corner don't violate my first amendment the city's lost a bunch of lawsuits over this
[3:37:45.280 --> 3:37:54.560]  I'm gonna sue you personally and I was out there just if I don't know six eight months ago it was
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:38:05.520]  the last scene an end game it's actually in the extras and the Austin police come over and I was a
[3:38:06.080 --> 3:38:09.760]  sergeant and some others wanted to arrest me and then the higher up showed up and said yeah
[3:38:09.760 --> 3:38:13.680]  arrest me and then the police basically refused they were arguing and I was going okay I'm gonna
[3:38:13.680 --> 3:38:18.800]  sue you please don't make me spend my issue and they finally got mad we're like and left hey man

[3:38:25.200 --> 3:38:30.400]  I don't want to have confrontations with you I know you're a dangerous paramilitary organization
[3:38:30.400 --> 3:38:37.040]  a gang the point is this is America leave me alone you know get that straight now New York
[3:38:37.040 --> 3:38:40.160]  they just don't care they will arrest you and they don't care they've lost hundreds and hundreds
[3:38:40.160 --> 3:38:44.320]  and hundreds it's got to be more than a thousand lawsuits for arresting press for arresting AP
[3:38:44.320 --> 3:38:50.880]  reporters I mean they don't care they've been told hey we're a criminal op have your way and
[3:38:50.880 --> 3:38:56.080]  it's bad folks and when I got to the New York police department they arrested me last 9-11 it was
[3:38:56.080 --> 3:39:01.200]  September 9 who were there for the last anniversary and they gave me the jail and they said what's
[3:39:01.200 --> 3:39:08.000]  the charge oh he had a cop and I went and they were like oh big cop me hit cops big man and I
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:12.560]  went you know that's not true and there were a hundred cameras out there and they go and then
[3:39:12.560 --> 3:39:18.160]  the head guy behind the counter goes is that true and they go yeah well you know he's a tough guy
[3:39:18.160 --> 3:39:24.480]  and they brought me behind the first iron door and they go I'm taking you cuffs off big guy
[3:39:24.480 --> 3:39:29.920]  you're not going to take a swing like you did at the other offices and I said I mean you have no
[3:39:29.920 --> 3:39:36.800]  respect for you folks and I said oh my god I just shook my head and they said we got a special sales
[3:39:36.800 --> 3:39:43.120]  for you they took me back not that one not this one was probably like 15 cells lined up on the
[3:39:43.120 --> 3:39:49.360]  first floor there ancient jail you know they had like the big old keys big giant keys and I'm walking
[3:39:49.360 --> 3:39:53.920]  by and they're not that oh because the empty cells were open and then every other cell had a person
[3:39:53.920 --> 3:39:59.120]  in it no not that one for you I'm going what's going on they take me down to the end he goes
[3:39:59.120 --> 3:40:06.400]  here it is and I says we walk towards the cell I see water on the floor running out to a drain
[3:40:06.400 --> 3:40:09.360]  and I walk in he's like this is your cell
[3:40:14.400 --> 3:40:20.880]  literally like out of a character of a movie and I'm like okay uh and overflowed toilet and you
[3:40:20.880 --> 3:40:27.200]  know what all over the floor and by the way no ac in there it was probably like 95 degrees that
[3:40:27.200 --> 3:40:31.200]  night so I'm like in this 100 degree cell which is fine I just laid down the cell and thought well
[3:40:31.200 --> 3:40:37.520]  this will be big in the news uh laid down there with the nice aroma wafting up from the floor
[3:40:41.760 --> 3:40:47.600]  and then about an hour and a half later let him go let him go I hear as they as they arrive the
[3:40:47.600 --> 3:40:52.320]  chant and the place is shaking would let him go with people all around the building chanting let
[3:40:52.320 --> 3:40:58.080]  him go all of a sudden all this brass shows up captain show up what are you in here for and
[3:40:58.080 --> 3:41:02.800]  they're like and then I hear him talking in the hall what you're resting for no sound permit for
[3:41:02.800 --> 3:41:08.400]  that's that's not an arrestable fence ah and they come back and then it's like you want something
[3:41:08.400 --> 3:41:13.920]  to drink one little something they bring me a little mcdonald's orange drink and oh we'll get
[3:41:13.920 --> 3:41:18.960]  you right out of here and then that was one I think he was a captain and then another one meets me
[3:41:18.960 --> 3:41:23.200]  at the door and he goes listen you get their people you get them out of here if there's any
[3:41:23.200 --> 3:41:28.720]  problems from you it's rock and roll and he goes hmm it's rock and roll with his fist I went there's
[3:41:28.720 --> 3:41:33.280]  like an old man saying this to me man it's mafia folks and I'm just like I go outside okay let's get
[3:41:33.280 --> 3:41:39.200]  out of here folks there's more cops for arriving and massing and uh what it was was those captains
[3:41:39.200 --> 3:41:43.520]  didn't like being called in from watching the football game or whatever it was they were doing
[3:41:43.520 --> 3:41:47.280]  that you know that night at 11 o'clock at night 10 o'clock at night I was about about 11 by then
[3:41:47.280 --> 3:41:53.840]  and it's just unbelievable oh we got a special cell for you
[3:41:56.320 --> 3:41:59.040]  and then they openly discussed framing me for hitting a cop
[3:41:59.840 --> 3:42:03.040]  no and those cops came up to me and said come here and talk to us and they said okay you're
[3:42:03.040 --> 3:42:05.920]  being arrested I just stuck my hands behind my back they didn't even have to touch me
[3:42:06.960 --> 3:42:12.400]  because I knew one wrong move my head was split and the victory against America would intensify
[3:42:12.400 --> 3:42:18.000]  the attack the vicious stabbing America in the in the in the heart would attack they would have
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:21.840]  their way with America by violating my first amendment by setting me up with criminal charges
[3:42:22.560 --> 3:42:25.760]  and they sleep good at night knowing they're setting people up they sleep good knowing their
[3:42:25.760 --> 3:42:30.000]  bosses bring in the narcotics they sleep good knowing they're a mafia you know badges and
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:35.440]  guns and a public that's brainwashed I mean how am I supposed to love you how am I supposed to
[3:42:35.440 --> 3:42:40.640]  like you how am I supposed to respect you I just thank god I live in Austin Texas which isn't one
[3:42:40.640 --> 3:42:46.000]  tenth as bad as New York because in New York when they shoot somebody in the back the cops don't get
[3:42:46.000 --> 3:42:53.520]  in trouble I have to say also Vada our new police chief is actually when cops shoot some innocent
[3:42:53.520 --> 3:43:01.120]  person in the back he's actually firing them people say oh he's anti-cop no if you punish bad cops
[3:43:01.120 --> 3:43:04.320]  then the system doesn't become corrupt and police get respect again
[3:43:04.320 --> 3:43:11.520]  in fact the former Seattle police chief just went public in a big playboy magazine article
[3:43:11.520 --> 3:43:16.000]  about two years ago saying my god you know 20 years ago or so we started having the policy
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:19.920]  of just offending all the corruption thinking that would stop lawsuits and actually it made
[3:43:19.920 --> 3:43:27.360]  it many times worse and he said police chiefs have to start punishing bad police and this gang
[3:43:27.360 --> 3:43:38.880]  mentality it has to happen I mean I'm not signing on a little bit of third world country
[3:43:38.880 --> 3:43:45.760]  where I'm bossed around by gang members in uniforms okay let's go to your phone calls here
[3:43:48.240 --> 3:43:51.280]  let's talk to bill in New Jersey than Mike and Scott you're on the air
[3:43:51.280 --> 3:43:59.360]  uh hi Alex are you there yes sir oh I just wanted to ask you about uh Ralph Nader
[3:43:59.360 --> 3:44:05.200]  and I plan on voting for him this year what do you think about him Ralph Nader comes on this show
[3:44:05.200 --> 3:44:12.880]  and we try to be nice to those we have on the show by a quirk of fate I was invited to speak
[3:44:12.880 --> 3:44:22.720]  at an anti-war rally and Crawford on the one year anniversary I guess it was 2004 March whatever it
[3:44:22.720 --> 3:44:28.960]  was the anniversary and there's like 500 people 600 people out there and the group that got the
[3:44:28.960 --> 3:44:35.760]  fairgrounds was nice and invited all the groups and then when those groups showed up they went
[3:44:35.760 --> 3:44:40.400]  Alex Jones is speaking there was little communists from UT they were like no we don't want to be
[3:44:40.400 --> 3:44:43.760]  part of this but Ralph Nader was like no let him let him it's their fairground let Alex Jones
[3:44:43.760 --> 3:44:48.720]  introduce me so I introduced Ralph Nader and uh you know I've had him on the as a guest a few
[3:44:48.720 --> 3:44:54.160]  times I think a lot of his go after corporate corruption stuff anti-war stuff's good I don't
[3:44:54.160 --> 3:44:59.680]  agree with some of his uh more socialist aspects but I think Ralph Nader's a genuine person who
[3:44:59.680 --> 3:45:05.040]  means well I'm not going to be voting for Ralph Nader um number one we don't have real voting
[3:45:05.040 --> 3:45:08.240]  in Travis County with the electronic voting machine has been proven to be fraudulent
[3:45:08.240 --> 3:45:13.920]  over and over again so I still though vote just to expose the corruption and to make it harder
[3:45:13.920 --> 3:45:18.320]  form to fix elections we have to all go vote and be involved around 40 percent of the country now
[3:45:18.320 --> 3:45:24.160]  really doesn't have voting that's been proven to be one of the towns that has that uh but uh
[3:45:26.160 --> 3:45:29.920]  I'll be voting for the Constitution party to try to strengthen true third parties
[3:45:30.800 --> 3:45:34.800]  but I wish Ron Paul was still running for president you know when he told us on the
[3:45:34.800 --> 3:45:38.560]  air he was basically wasn't going to win three or four months ago people couldn't believe it even
[3:45:38.560 --> 3:45:42.880]  when he said it and said I lied then I had him back on to say it again and still they say I'm
[3:45:42.880 --> 3:45:46.560]  making that up it's kind of a delusional still getting emails going how dare you traitor he
[3:45:46.560 --> 3:45:52.320]  will be president and I'm just like okay all righty then you know uh but uh you know that's
[3:45:52.320 --> 3:46:00.000]  my take on that all right thank you thank you my friend uh let's go ahead and talk to Mike in
[3:46:00.000 --> 3:46:06.240]  Georgia Mike you're on the air hey Alex um great show today I love the new prison planet and everything
[3:46:06.240 --> 3:46:11.120]  you guys have done with it the behind the scenes interviews and everything well we're about to redesign
[3:46:11.120 --> 3:46:16.480]  prison planet again with a different look so and actually this new system we're going to have
[3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:20.320]  the headers going to be a different image every day it's going to it's going to be a more revolutionary
[3:46:20.320 --> 3:46:25.200]  website yeah well the behind the scenes interviews and the live video stream is oh you mean you like
[3:46:25.200 --> 3:46:30.000]  what i'm doing with prison planet dot tv got you yeah yeah i mean it's what i've always wanted you
[3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:35.840]  got to do it it's awesome it's great um i just had two quick questions for you um can you tell me
[3:46:35.840 --> 3:46:41.280]  what countries are left in the world that uh don't have a new world order control debt based
[3:46:41.280 --> 3:46:46.800]  monetary system well now now just yeah now there are countries that aren't new world are controlled
[3:46:46.800 --> 3:46:51.440]  but because governments are generally evil and wicked 99% of the time it doesn't mean those
[3:46:51.440 --> 3:46:56.000]  countries are good i want to be clear right right so so let me tell you it's every country under to
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:47:02.880]  attack it's libya it's iran sorry go ahead and ask your question are there any left that don't have
[3:47:02.880 --> 3:47:09.440]  a debt based monetary system like like ours yeah let me list them uh it's every rogue nation when you
[3:47:09.440 --> 3:47:17.840]  see the peanut list of 66 rogue nations every one of those isn't new world order controlled and almost
[3:47:17.840 --> 3:47:22.560]  none of them have a debt based private banker system they have a government issued currency
[3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:27.360]  and so any rogue nation the good the bad the ugly the corrupt the not corrupt there's very few that
[3:47:27.360 --> 3:47:31.120]  aren't corrupt i mean shaves is on the surface anti-new world order but he's doing a lot of
[3:47:31.120 --> 3:47:36.640]  stuff i disagree with you know i'm for freedom freedom of the press the rest of it um but no
[3:47:36.640 --> 3:47:42.000]  there are very few of the 60 i haven't done a study of it but i know that well some of them have a
[3:47:42.000 --> 3:47:47.040]  debt money system but their own most of them don't and so any country that's not basically run by the
[3:47:47.040 --> 3:47:52.960]  bankers where they own the money machines uh is uh covertly overthrown sanctions or they're invaded
[3:47:54.560 --> 3:48:00.320]  uh one more quick question um and i think it was in game you uh we're talking about the uh
[3:48:00.320 --> 3:48:04.320]  societies and throughout history that were truly free and i think you said there was only something
[3:48:04.320 --> 3:48:11.120]  like 11 or 12 could have been considered truly free could you uh uh tell me what a few of those were
