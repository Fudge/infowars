[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:30.680]  John Rappaport sitting in for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones show welcome we've got stories
[00:30.680 --> 00:37.240]  new stories old stories all kinds of stories my name is John Rappaport again
[00:37.240 --> 00:41.600]  sitting in for Alex Jones I'm an investigative reporter you can find my
[00:41.600 --> 00:48.200]  material at no more fake news dot com produced a film recently American
[00:48.200 --> 00:53.780]  addict prescription addiction in America will be premiering at the Seattle
[00:53.780 --> 00:59.840]  International Film Festival May June of this year and also a 10-hour audio
[00:59.840 --> 01:05.840]  seminar you can pick up on my site called vaccines armed and dangerous okay
[01:05.840 --> 01:12.080]  enough with the plugs I've got to start with Joe Biden I mean Joe is just too
[01:12.080 --> 01:16.400]  good to be true I don't know why people don't follow this guy around 24 hours a
[01:16.400 --> 01:24.120]  day because if anybody could be more wrong I don't know who it is Joe says
[01:24.120 --> 01:33.960]  that the plan to kill bin Laden was the most audacious plan in the last 500 years
[01:33.960 --> 01:42.040]  wow Joe in the last 500 years especially I suppose if bin Laden were already dead
[01:42.040 --> 01:46.600]  when the special forces went in there and I've been asking for a long time
[01:46.600 --> 01:52.880]  now ever since this raid where is the dialysis machine you know people were
[01:52.880 --> 01:56.080]  saying well we want evidence that bin Laden was really there and can you
[01:56.080 --> 02:00.960]  provide us any evidence well according to all these sources who claimed that he
[02:00.960 --> 02:07.640]  was still alive and didn't die in 2001 he was receiving dialysis he was always
[02:07.640 --> 02:12.720]  on the verge of dying he was dying when was it in 2001 when the CIA visited him
[02:12.720 --> 02:19.040]  in a hospital in Europe so where's the dialysis machine that they got from the
[02:19.040 --> 02:28.400]  house the bunker in Pakistan never heard anything about it anyway Joe says the
[02:28.400 --> 02:33.840]  most audacious plan in the last 500 years which I assume means since the year
[02:33.840 --> 02:41.600]  1500 or so if my math is correct nothing has even begun to rival this not the
[02:41.600 --> 02:49.880]  American Revolution not D-Day take your pick Joe as always is right on the money
[02:49.880 --> 02:55.160]  and he says that the reason this is the most audacious was that there was
[02:55.160 --> 02:59.840]  something like a 48 percent chance of success of the mission I'd really like
[02:59.840 --> 03:05.880]  to see how they calculated that down and that if it had failed Obama would
[03:05.880 --> 03:10.560]  certainly have been a one-term president really Joe he just said well we raided
[03:10.560 --> 03:17.360]  we didn't make it but we're still looking onward anyway always got a lead
[03:17.360 --> 03:23.600]  with Joe but let's get a lot more serious here and talk about the story
[03:23.600 --> 03:30.040]  that's up right now at info wars dot com aborted babies are being chopped up and
[03:30.040 --> 03:37.800]  sold to researchers all over America did you hear that aborted babies are being
[03:37.800 --> 03:42.800]  chopped up and sold to researchers all over America this is actually nothing
[03:42.800 --> 03:50.360]  new but we have new revelations fetuses at 10 or 20 weeks aborted it in
[03:50.360 --> 03:57.560]  clinics cells are shipped all over the U.S. to medical researchers we're talking
[03:57.560 --> 04:01.800]  about brain cells in particular here but not only that the brain cells are
[04:01.800 --> 04:07.760]  injected into the eyes of patients with macular degeneration
[04:10.080 --> 04:14.840]  practice of shipping organs and body parts of course has been going on for a
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.960]  very very long time in fact you'll see a link in the story on info wars dot com
[04:19.960 --> 04:30.040]  where aborted fetuses still alive had to be killed in order to harvest their
[04:30.040 --> 04:39.280]  body parts so read that article check out the links this is part of the medical
[04:39.280 --> 04:43.760]  complex this is what is happening in America and all over the world and we're

[08:33.000 --> 08:40.880]  jacob styler nine-year-old boy in michigan treated for cancer then the
[08:40.880 --> 08:49.120]  scans were clear no cancer the michigan department of human services tried
[08:49.120 --> 08:58.160]  twice to force jacob to have further chemotherapy with three drugs that
[08:58.160 --> 09:06.360]  admittedly have the risk of causing cancer they lost they lost their case
[09:06.360 --> 09:13.040]  the styler family one but of course the michigan department of human services
[09:13.040 --> 09:18.240]  didn't stop they're back again they've appealed the case now the parents don't
[09:18.240 --> 09:24.060]  want jacob to have more chemo and on top of this these three drugs these three
[09:24.060 --> 09:31.680]  chemo drugs are not approved for use in children do you get this how this is
[09:31.680 --> 09:38.400]  working here folks I mean this is like somebody knocking on your door you open
[09:38.400 --> 09:42.680]  it he's got a gun and he says I've got a canister of poison here and I want you
[09:42.680 --> 09:50.520]  to drink it now because it's good for you this is exactly what's going down here
[09:50.520 --> 09:56.480]  in michigan jacob styler nine-year-old boy treated for cancer the scans are now
[09:56.480 --> 10:01.760]  clear but the doctors don't like this they want to do more chemo with three drugs
[10:01.760 --> 10:06.680]  that have the potential to cause cancer and who are they being backed by the
[10:06.680 --> 10:12.160]  government hello Michigan Department of Human Services has gone to court twice
[10:12.160 --> 10:18.240]  and now the third time on appeal the parents don't want their son to have
[10:18.240 --> 10:23.680]  more chemo from drugs that can cause cancer drugs that have not been approved
[10:23.680 --> 10:30.640]  for children nobody seems to care in the government in fact they're forcing this
[10:30.640 --> 10:39.680]  literally forcing it lesson moral of the story this is what is waiting for you
[10:39.680 --> 10:46.480]  and your children and your grand your grandchildren up the road with national
[10:46.480 --> 10:52.040]  health care insurance with Obamacare I've been making this point for the last
[10:52.040 --> 10:56.880]  year and a half more and more people seem to be listening finally don't you
[10:56.880 --> 11:00.680]  understand what this is really all about national health insurance this is
[11:00.680 --> 11:06.320]  about forcing you to take only standardized treatments and who decides
[11:06.320 --> 11:11.480]  that the US Department of Health and Human Services this treatment is okay
[11:11.480 --> 11:17.080]  this treatment you can't do in fact this treatment over here you must do and if
[11:17.080 --> 11:21.640]  you don't we kick you out of the program and who knows you could be put in jail
[11:21.640 --> 11:25.600]  you could be fine because you're all in the system now everybody's in the system
[11:25.600 --> 11:30.520]  you're all on this program you see everybody's been touting this insurance
[11:30.520 --> 11:34.120]  says it's the most wonderful thing in the world and it gives everybody what
[11:34.120 --> 11:37.880]  they need it gives them health care it gives them medical care it gives them
[11:37.880 --> 11:44.560]  all this wonderfulness that we all need and want and love from cradle to grave
[11:44.560 --> 11:51.040]  yeah that's the cover story folks the actual story is it gives the pharmaceutical
[11:51.040 --> 11:58.960]  and medical cartel an opportunity to make you into a cipher a number and force
[11:58.960 --> 12:03.760]  treatments down your throat and make enormous profits at the same time and
[12:03.760 --> 12:11.480]  also claim what treatments are not available so you could be next they
[12:11.480 --> 12:14.880]  could come to your door and they could say guess what we're gonna give you
[12:14.880 --> 12:20.480]  chemo no you're not oh yes we are oh yes we are we're gonna go to court to
[12:20.480 --> 12:27.160]  insist on it because you're under the national health insurance plan you've
[12:27.160 --> 12:33.040]  got to do it well you say I want to present evidence in court that this
[12:33.040 --> 12:37.480]  doesn't work that these three drugs can actually cause cancer the ones that you
[12:37.480 --> 12:44.320]  put me on and they haven't been approved for use you know in my child whom you
[12:44.320 --> 12:48.920]  want to poison with these drugs well certainly sir you can have your day in
[12:48.920 --> 12:53.600]  court and then you go to court and guess what you find out guess what you find
[12:53.600 --> 13:00.080]  out you're not permitted to present any evidence evidence is not the issue you
[13:00.080 --> 13:06.760]  see the truth doesn't matter facts don't matter the only thing that matters is the
[13:06.760 --> 13:12.400]  law and the law is that you're now part of the system part of the program you
[13:12.400 --> 13:19.120]  can't opt out that's the law and your betters the people who know far more than
[13:19.120 --> 13:23.760]  you do about science and medicine and so forth have set the standards for what
[13:23.760 --> 13:28.120]  treatments are available and what you must get is treatment and what you can't
[13:28.120 --> 13:35.040]  get so some judge is going to listen to you argue the merits of these chemo
[13:35.040 --> 13:41.400]  drugs you a lay person are you kidding do you seriously think that you're going
[13:41.400 --> 13:45.120]  to get your day in court I've been in court when this kind of thing happened
[13:45.120 --> 13:51.160]  I've seen the federal government operate on people who they didn't want to allow
[13:51.160 --> 13:57.880]  to get out from under the thumb the big iron fist of certain medical treatments
[13:57.880 --> 14:01.920]  or who were going the other way on natural treatment I've seen this come
[14:01.920 --> 14:08.320]  down so Jacob Stiler nine years old from Michigan is now being defended by a
[14:08.320 --> 14:14.280]  homeschooling legal association and they're trying to get him off the hook
[14:14.280 --> 14:19.320]  so there isn't have to take three poisonous chemo drugs that can cause
[14:19.320 --> 14:26.760]  cancer when his cancer scans are completely clear he's got to go to court
[14:26.760 --> 14:35.720]  to try to defend himself at nine years old so to speak to live a healthy life
[14:35.720 --> 14:40.640]  to not be killed by these drugs because that's what we're talking about to not
[14:40.640 --> 14:46.920]  be killed by these drugs sir I'm nine years old and I'd like not to be killed
[14:46.920 --> 14:55.000]  by these drugs may I speak no son you may not we know what's good for you and
[14:55.000 --> 15:02.400]  this is what's going down this is what is going down is this the first time
[15:02.400 --> 15:05.760]  something like this happened the United States of course not it's happened many
[15:05.760 --> 15:10.200]  times before in fact in the state of Michigan there was another family that
[15:10.200 --> 15:14.800]  didn't want their child this is now going back 15 20 years to be forced to
[15:14.800 --> 15:21.880]  take AZT which was a failed chemotherapy drug that causes cells in the
[15:21.880 --> 15:27.880]  body to stop reproducing and they had to go justify themselves over and over
[15:27.880 --> 15:33.160]  again and the last I was informed they had escaped by the skin of their teeth
[15:33.160 --> 15:37.600]  but this is the medical police state America that's coming down folks and
[15:37.600 --> 15:42.360]  this is John Rappaport sitting in for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones show today
[15:42.360 --> 15:47.960]  you can find my work at no more fake news dot com we're getting deeply by
[15:47.960 --> 15:55.800]  degrees into the medical cartel why is that so important because they are the
[15:55.800 --> 16:01.120]  leading edge of the New World Order or if you want to call it something
[16:01.120 --> 16:06.560]  softer the de facto global management system and why are they the leading edge
[16:06.560 --> 16:11.880]  because they don't look political they don't look left they don't look right
[16:11.880 --> 16:16.040]  they don't look senator they look neutral we are the scientists we're the
[16:16.040 --> 16:22.440]  priests in the white coats we are the biggest religion on the planet and you
[16:22.440 --> 16:29.520]  listen to us and you do what we say this is body control operant conditioning
[16:29.520 --> 16:37.400]  programming mind control that the doctor has control over your life that by
[16:37.400 --> 16:42.200]  feeding you debilitating toxic pharmaceuticals which we'll go into in
[16:42.200 --> 16:48.040]  depth later on eventually you will become so fuzzy so debilitated so
[16:48.040 --> 16:53.640]  unable to think so disabled that you will be one of millions and billions of
[16:53.640 --> 17:01.480]  people like you all over the planet who are in capital letters easy to control
[17:01.480 --> 17:08.960]  this is called population control that's what the medical cartel ultimately is
[17:08.960 --> 17:15.680]  all about and this story about Jacob Steyler is just the tip of the iceberg
[17:15.680 --> 17:20.680]  on that so let's flip over to the other side for coin here a story about
[17:20.680 --> 17:26.280]  somebody who survived when he should have been dead by conventional means
[17:26.280 --> 17:36.800]  because his mother went to something alternative not exactly approved not
[17:36.800 --> 17:42.440]  exactly approved by the fascist dictators who decide what you can do with
[17:42.440 --> 17:46.240]  your own body and what you can't do this is a story I covered some years ago
[17:46.240 --> 17:52.920]  out of Florida a 15 year old boy who was found by his mother literally drowned
[17:52.920 --> 17:59.320]  in the swimming pool rushed to the hospital put on machines to keep them
[17:59.320 --> 18:02.920]  alive after a couple of days the doctors came up to the mother and they
[18:02.920 --> 18:08.360]  said well you know shaking their heads there's nothing we can do now you can
[18:08.360 --> 18:14.560]  keep them on the machines but really he's dead she didn't accept that this
[18:14.560 --> 18:21.400]  was a woman with guts from here to the moon so she began to go around knocking
[18:21.400 --> 18:25.400]  on doors knocking down doors looking for alternative treatments what could she
[18:25.400 --> 18:29.880]  possibly find one thing after another while her son was still on the machines
[18:29.880 --> 18:35.880]  and the doctors were telling her to take him off she finally found a doctor who
[18:35.880 --> 18:43.240]  said that hyperbaric oxygen might help it's a treatment you get in a tank you
[18:43.240 --> 18:47.800]  receive oxygen from somebody who's trained not just somebody off the street
[18:47.800 --> 18:53.600]  and how to administer oxygen at slightly higher pressure than at sea level was
[18:53.600 --> 19:00.240]  originally developed by the US Navy to cure the bends and that the thesis went
[19:00.240 --> 19:06.040]  oxygen might be able to get to aspects of the brain where the cells appeared to
[19:06.040 --> 19:12.040]  be dead but they were actually only idling like the motor of a car this
[19:12.040 --> 19:17.720]  thesis was put forward by Dr. Richard Neubauer of Florida lauderdale by the
[19:17.720 --> 19:22.880]  sea who is a pioneer in extending the uses of hyperbaric oxygen okay so the
[19:22.880 --> 19:27.240]  mother goes back to the doctors and she says and I've met her okay this is not

[24:17.760 --> 24:25.120]  about Ryan a 15 year old boy on machines dead the doctor said as good as
[24:25.120 --> 24:32.720]  dead his mother is going around she finds somebody who's got a theory about
[24:32.720 --> 24:38.320]  hyperbaric oxygen you get in a tank somebody who really knows what they're
[24:38.320 --> 24:44.460]  doing is a technician maybe this can wake up brain cells that were thought to be
[24:44.460 --> 24:49.680]  dead but they're actually idling so I hear this story and she tells me that
[24:49.680 --> 24:55.620]  indeed she managed to force literally this is a big hospital they've got this
[24:55.620 --> 25:01.880]  kid on machines to transport him to another clinic where he's going to get
[25:01.880 --> 25:06.160]  hyperbaric oxygen if you don't think that's a hercule and task you try
[25:06.160 --> 25:11.720]  something like that sometime well she pulled it off 50 or 60 treatments with
[25:11.720 --> 25:18.760]  oxygen later she tells me her son is still alive after being pronounced
[25:18.760 --> 25:24.560]  dead and he's off the machines so you know do I believe this as a reporter do
[25:24.560 --> 25:30.920]  I not believe it she says let's talk we meet in Los Angeles we're sitting I
[25:30.920 --> 25:39.280]  remember this very clearly sitting by a fountain in West LA we're talking very
[25:39.280 --> 25:47.080]  engaging woman my son is alive I'm saying yes yes yes yes yes but you know
[25:47.080 --> 25:55.120]  I mean the doctors said he was dead she says well here we go and I turned around
[25:55.120 --> 26:03.520]  and there's her son 15 years old walking toward me now I've confirmed the
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.080]  other parts of the story so I know what happened before this I know that what
[26:08.080 --> 26:14.760]  she's telling me is so he's alive he's walking he walks up to me shakes my hand
[26:14.760 --> 26:19.300]  this is a kid who drowned in a swimming pool who was put on life support the
[26:19.300 --> 26:31.960]  doctor said no chance and an alternative treatment was tried the kid is now
[26:31.960 --> 26:43.440]  alive his gate as he walks is somewhat awkward when he talks I'm not able to
[26:43.440 --> 26:48.440]  understand everything he says but his mother can understand every single word
[26:48.440 --> 26:54.360]  he says and they're going back and forth like gangbusters right the kid is
[26:54.360 --> 27:02.240]  alive without that treatment there would have been no life for him I mean you
[27:02.240 --> 27:06.360]  know it's like you're off you're on you're off you're on you're dead you're
[27:06.360 --> 27:13.040]  alive and I'm bringing this story up in contrast to the Jacob Stiler case of the
[27:13.040 --> 27:18.480]  nine-year-old who's being forced if the court wins to be poisoned with three
[27:18.480 --> 27:26.280]  chemo drugs because I'm also telling you that this whole national health
[27:26.280 --> 27:35.200]  insurance fiasco plan op as they say in the intelligence racket it's an op an
[27:35.200 --> 27:42.120]  operation is designed to force you into a system where you must take certain
[27:42.120 --> 27:48.800]  treatments many of which will be extremely toxic and you will be denied
[27:48.800 --> 27:53.000]  treatments that you would want to explore on your own such as the one that
[27:53.000 --> 28:05.720]  saved the life of this 15-year-old Ryan with hyperbaric oxygen yes no on off this
[28:05.720 --> 28:10.960]  is the strategy this is what is going on up the road this is what is waiting for
[28:10.960 --> 28:18.360]  you yes the death panels and so on and so forth but behind all of that and I'm
[28:18.360 --> 28:24.160]  basing this on 30 years of experience as a medical investigative reporter into
[28:24.160 --> 28:32.800]  fraud into deep conspiracy if you will and I will they are going to tailor and
[28:32.800 --> 28:37.960]  shape and list all of the treatments that will be permitted and not be
[28:37.960 --> 28:41.840]  permitted for every single condition under the Sun that you can imagine they
[28:41.840 --> 28:45.600]  already said it as much I mean it's an open story Department of Health and
[28:45.600 --> 28:53.600]  Human Services a cabinet post under the president they decide the pharmaceutical
[28:53.600 --> 29:00.160]  cartel of course wants to eliminate alternative medicine and alternative
[29:00.160 --> 29:07.840]  health in the form of nutrients herbs nutritional supplements that's their
[29:07.840 --> 29:16.040]  burgeoning competition so what do they do to eliminate it why was the
[29:16.040 --> 29:20.080]  pharmaceutical cartel so behind this whole idea of nationalized health
[29:20.080 --> 29:24.780]  insurance well of course on the one hand they get paid the guaranteed to get
[29:24.780 --> 29:29.320]  paid but on the other hand they can shape the future of all medical treatment
[29:29.320 --> 29:33.720]  and deny you what you really want and force down your throat what can hurt
[29:33.720 --> 29:39.840]  and even possibly kill you John Rappaport Sillings for Alex Jones don't go
[29:39.840 --> 29:48.960]  anywhere we'll be right back with a very special guest
[29:48.960 --> 29:58.280]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:59.280 --> 30:03.280]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[30:03.280 --> 30:07.640]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[30:07.640 --> 30:11.800]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[30:11.800 --> 30:15.840]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[30:15.840 --> 30:19.720]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:19.720 --> 30:24.000]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:24.000 --> 30:28.160]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.160 --> 30:32.480]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.480 --> 30:35.680]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[30:35.680 --> 30:40.040]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[30:40.040 --> 30:43.360]  peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[30:43.360 --> 30:46.600]  solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more
[30:46.600 --> 30:51.600]  information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com

[32:12.480 --> 32:17.400]  had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be

[33:08.520 --> 33:15.000]  this is John Rapport sitting in for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones show Robert
[33:15.000 --> 33:22.880]  Bales sergeant accused of killing 19 Afghan civilians you all know the story
[33:22.880 --> 33:29.160]  it's all over the place a special guest coming on right now we're going to
[33:29.160 --> 33:33.720]  discuss this story and the related whole issue of what's going on in the
[33:33.720 --> 33:40.080]  military but before I bring this man on I just have to tell you that I don't have
[33:40.080 --> 33:45.320]  too many heroes but he's one of them I met him I'm going to say 25 years ago
[33:45.320 --> 33:54.440]  now Dr. Peter Braggen MD psychiatrist who wrote one of the great books of the
[33:54.440 --> 33:59.360]  20th century involving science called toxic psychiatry that turned my
[33:59.360 --> 34:03.960]  thinking around completely as a medical investigator reporter on what was going
[34:03.960 --> 34:08.320]  on in the entire psychiatric profession with the toxicity of drugs and false
[34:08.320 --> 34:15.200]  diagnoses and so on and he has stood up against his entire profession practically
[34:15.200 --> 34:21.320]  over the years not only stood up but thrived and stood up against the
[34:21.320 --> 34:25.560]  pharmaceutical companies who have been trying to push psychiatric drugs down
[34:25.560 --> 34:30.920]  people's throats all over the place and he's worked as expert witness in court
[34:30.920 --> 34:38.440]  on key key decisions involving psychiatric drugs and violence and so on
[34:38.440 --> 34:44.800]  Dr. Peter Braggen B-R-E-G-G-I-N I'm spelling it so you'll go to his site
[34:44.800 --> 34:51.080]  www.braggen.com Peter welcome to the show
[34:51.080 --> 34:57.040]  John it's a pleasure to be on for you I probably is hardly anyone else so that
[34:57.040 --> 35:02.200]  would be doing what I'm doing right now I'm I'm was gonna take a leisurely two
[35:02.200 --> 35:06.640]  hour drive see a doctor in Syracuse with my wife and I was thinking we were
[35:06.640 --> 35:11.800]  finally gonna get to relax together and then you called and I said now I'm gonna
[35:11.800 --> 35:17.600]  talk with John I said ginger how do you feel about having John on the phone or
[35:17.600 --> 35:23.960]  whatever time while we drive she said oh for John sure so here we are and here
[35:23.960 --> 35:30.400]  we are Peter that thanks I appreciate it I really do all right so we know that
[35:30.400 --> 35:35.600]  this guy Sergeant Robert Bales according to some reports anyway had a head
[35:35.600 --> 35:40.520]  injury sustained a head injury and we also know that frequently what follows
[35:40.520 --> 35:44.600]  from that in the army these days is that they start prescribing psychiatric
[35:44.600 --> 35:49.160]  medications often because the patient experiences something that they interpret
[35:49.160 --> 35:56.000]  as quote depression and we know what the effects of these drugs are so I want
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.960]  you to just tell our audience here and we're tucked folks this is an expert
[36:00.960 --> 36:06.000]  expert what is happening in the military with the proliferation of
[36:06.000 --> 36:12.440]  psychiatric drugs and what is the effect on the behavior of troops well I'm
[36:12.440 --> 36:16.320]  glad you're putting it in a broad context because there are so many aspects of
[36:16.320 --> 36:20.720]  this case that would be just really important for your audience first of all
[36:20.720 --> 36:27.720]  it's no question that anybody who's had four deployments is suffering from what
[36:27.720 --> 36:34.480]  we call post-traumatic stress disorder it's not really a disorder he's
[36:34.480 --> 36:40.280]  suffering from the reaction of a normal person with a normal brain too
[36:40.280 --> 36:46.840]  horrific stress it's just no way that if the poor deployment he isn't
[36:46.840 --> 36:53.840]  emotionally compromised because that's the natural response of the human
[36:53.840 --> 36:58.240]  normal human being with a normal brain to these kinds of experiences just one
[36:58.240 --> 37:03.000]  deployment let alone four so the whole idea of him having four deployments I
[37:03.000 --> 37:07.720]  mean we are we're abusing our soldiers with these multiple deployment that
[37:07.720 --> 37:14.840]  was setting them up for violence for suicide or for life-long reliving and
[37:14.840 --> 37:19.960]  re-experiencing of this these trauma that's that's the first thing the second
[37:19.960 --> 37:23.960]  thing is is it does sound like he has traumatic that he had traumatic brain
[37:23.960 --> 37:30.120]  injury do that something close to that language is used by the official reports
[37:30.120 --> 37:36.400]  and when you have a traumatic brain injury interestingly enough John it's
[37:36.400 --> 37:42.480]  almost impossible to distinguish it from what we're calling PTSD again I don't
[37:42.480 --> 37:48.600]  think it's a disorder PTSD it's a natural reaction but the it's very hard to tell
[37:48.600 --> 37:55.040]  them apart the person gets a irritable and edgy easily overstimulated the
[37:55.040 --> 38:01.600]  person reacts with with judgment stresses feels constantly eager has
[38:01.600 --> 38:09.760]  difficulty of thinking and a normal quick fashion judgment is aired and what
[38:09.760 --> 38:15.960]  happens when they jump in with the drugs Peter well that that adds to it
[38:15.960 --> 38:22.720]  interestingly enough because the drugs produced exactly the same so if you are
[38:22.720 --> 38:26.920]  taking and the odds are overwhelming and I want to get into that if we can't
[38:26.920 --> 38:31.680]  some detail what's going on in the service with drugs but if you're taking an anti-depressants
[38:31.680 --> 38:38.040]  but what are its common common adverse effects over stimulation anxiety
[38:38.040 --> 38:44.080]  jumping this hostility and the rest of this and a long-term effect of just you
[38:44.080 --> 38:49.520]  know you're just not caring about what you do anymore so we got anti-depressants
[38:49.520 --> 38:53.720]  but it's probably been given at some time almost with certainty at some time
[38:53.720 --> 39:01.640]  we have the the head injury we've got the trauma of these repeated deployments
[39:01.640 --> 39:06.680]  and then you've documented Peter you've documented time and time again that
[39:06.680 --> 39:12.240]  these anti-depressants the SSRI anti-depressants like Zoloft and Paxil
[39:12.240 --> 39:21.680]  and Prozac can and do cause incidents of suicide and homicide oh absolutely I'm
[39:21.680 --> 39:28.960]  I'm evaluating a military case right now of a homicide yeah right this moment I
[39:28.960 --> 39:32.920]  can't give you another word about it but yeah I'm evaluating a case right now
[39:32.920 --> 39:39.000]  that and and I've seen many in this and the civilian life as well there's no
[39:39.000 --> 39:42.560]  doubt about it you know John I testified before Congress about a year ago
[39:42.560 --> 39:47.480]  before the House Committee on Veterans Affairs I you know I was the key
[39:47.480 --> 39:52.440]  witness I said I let off with a half an hour discussion of how these drugs
[39:52.440 --> 39:59.240]  over stimulate people and will drive them in the direction of
[39:59.240 --> 40:04.280]  up violence suicide there's another factor I want to add in because we've got
[40:04.280 --> 40:10.160]  like about five factors the leagering this individual another is that he's
[40:10.160 --> 40:15.200]  working at one of these outposts and I've talked to people who've worked those
[40:15.200 --> 40:21.120]  outposts I've talked to therapists who have been in them and you've got this
[40:21.120 --> 40:27.400]  horrific problem which is that your task with relating to the civilian
[40:27.400 --> 40:32.440]  population building schools helping them out you know helping them with their
[40:32.440 --> 40:36.320]  wells or whatever other help we can provide and then you're supposed to
[40:36.320 --> 40:42.240]  turn around and kill people right well well that but first at night they're
[40:42.240 --> 40:47.880]  turning against you because the very people you're working with are going
[40:47.880 --> 40:53.240]  to contain some of the archive of some of the of the enemy and then of course
[40:53.240 --> 40:58.480]  yes you're supposed to kill them but under very very limited rules of
[40:58.480 --> 41:04.080]  engagement that don't really allow for self-defense so it's a bizarre
[41:04.080 --> 41:09.240]  situation this guy I mean we're looking at four or five factors that would have
[41:09.240 --> 41:13.920]  been impinging on him now can I talk a little more just about the drugs and
[41:13.920 --> 41:18.360]  what's going on in the military yeah and the way the way I'd like to have you
[41:18.360 --> 41:26.680]  kind of boil it down here is the increase the incredible change that's
[41:26.680 --> 41:31.720]  taking place here with loading up of psychiatric drugs here in the military
[41:31.720 --> 41:37.920]  over the last whatever ten years well it's a very good way to begin John it's
[41:37.920 --> 41:45.840]  bizarre before the Iraq war soldiers did not go into combat on psychiatric
[41:45.840 --> 41:53.400]  drugs they just it's starting with the Iraq war psychiatry and the psychopharmaceutical
[41:53.400 --> 41:59.640]  complex got this top-down power my wife my wife is the one that educated me
[41:59.640 --> 42:03.640]  ginger about how the country goes into situations where they can be right at
[42:03.640 --> 42:09.040]  the top and then spread on down so they go into the military and they spread on
[42:09.040 --> 42:15.720]  down the drug so we have gone from the situation in which soldiers didn't go
[42:15.720 --> 42:23.680]  into combat on drugs before Iraq to where estimates of 20% or more of these
[42:23.680 --> 42:30.960]  young mostly young men and women are carrying drugs into combat yeah that's
[42:30.960 --> 42:37.360]  the key that in other words they can just self-dose themselves they are given up
[42:37.360 --> 42:44.800]  to a hundred and eighty days to carry with them of mind-bending drugs like
[42:44.800 --> 42:51.480]  benzos and stimulants and even the anti-psychotics severed will or sleep a
[42:51.480 --> 42:56.280]  hundred eighty days now you're 19 to 20 years old you've been told these things
[42:56.280 --> 43:01.520]  are good to stress what are you gonna do you're gonna pop them prescribed you're gonna pop them
[43:01.520 --> 43:07.600]  exactly you're gonna trade them you're gonna not know what you're taking some
[43:07.600 --> 43:15.600]  of the time trading them yeah this is gonna do this is complete chaos I mean
[43:15.600 --> 43:21.520]  you and I have talked over the years so much about the violent behavior including
[43:21.520 --> 43:26.080]  you know at the time of the Columbine shootings we were talking about these two
[43:26.080 --> 43:31.080]  young kids who are on lou vox and I questioned you very closely on the
[43:31.080 --> 43:36.040]  potential effects of those drugs in mounting grandiose schemes that involve
[43:36.040 --> 43:41.160]  violence and so forth and here we're talking about actually putting you know
[43:41.160 --> 43:46.040]  untold numbers of soldiers out on the battlefield under battlefield conditions
[43:46.040 --> 43:51.400]  under all this stress with a hundred and eighty days of these anti-depressants
[43:51.400 --> 43:55.920]  and other psychiatric drugs that could cause them to just commit suicide turn
[43:55.920 --> 44:00.920]  around and kill people go into all kinds of bizarre behavior it's nuts John it's
[44:00.920 --> 44:06.000]  absolutely nothing it's so good that you're you're giving more you know more
[44:06.000 --> 44:12.880]  opportunity for people to learn about this the you were referring I think to
[44:12.880 --> 44:20.200]  Eric Harris and Columbine and I know for a fact that Eric Harris who was perhaps
[44:20.200 --> 44:28.720]  the leader of the two boys was taking lou vox at the time of the shooting and
[44:28.720 --> 44:32.400]  here give you an idea and we should address it's out of the media is
[44:32.400 --> 44:38.520]  covering up all this about a year ago USA today that's the year going did a
[44:38.520 --> 44:45.080]  review of let's relook at Columbine and it said exactly we now know that Eric
[44:45.080 --> 44:49.760]  Harris was taking Lou vox at the time of the shooting so I wrote to them and I
[44:49.760 --> 44:56.680]  said look I have the official FDA documentation but he was had a quote
[44:56.680 --> 45:02.360]  it's so ironic on a book of a therapeutic level of Lou vox of his blood on
[45:02.360 --> 45:11.200]  autopsy wow war I have the autopsy corners report and the same thing and just so
[45:11.200 --> 45:17.000]  our listeners know this is another one of these SSRI anti-depressants Lou vox
[45:17.000 --> 45:25.040]  that can indeed like all of them stimulate violence homicide suicide
[45:25.040 --> 45:31.560]  absolutely and the press you of course USA today did not respond to me at all
[45:31.560 --> 45:37.600]  what a big surprise that is you know they didn't want to change the why so much
[45:37.600 --> 45:43.960]  is the money and power and then John why isn't anybody asking the question you're
[45:43.960 --> 45:50.680]  asking you are the first media person to get touch with me to ask the question
[45:50.680 --> 45:56.400]  about could he have been on psychiatric drugs the author overwhelming that he was
[45:56.400 --> 46:01.720]  that he was you know we've got another story here Peter in San Diego where I'm
[46:01.720 --> 46:08.040]  from about this guy Jason Russell who was the director of the invisible
[46:08.040 --> 46:14.520]  children video that's gone viral Coney 2012 and then ended up running around on
[46:14.520 --> 46:18.480]  the street naked and doing all kinds of crazy things and what is now in
[46:18.480 --> 46:22.680]  psychiatric lockdown in San Diego I don't know whether you know about this
[46:22.680 --> 46:27.200]  story but you know here's okay so there's a lot could be said in all
[46:27.200 --> 46:32.360]  different sides of this issue about the video that's the point of this though is
[46:32.360 --> 46:38.640]  you know where does somebody suddenly do this you know people have now been
[46:38.640 --> 46:43.160]  trained conditioned to accept this kind of thing oh yeah well somebody walked
[46:43.160 --> 46:47.160]  into a school and shot up the school oh yeah well somebody ran out on the
[46:47.160 --> 46:51.200]  street naked all of a sudden never did anything like that in his life before and
[46:51.200 --> 46:56.600]  so again the question has to be asked I mean was he under some kind of psychiatric
[46:56.600 --> 47:01.000]  care was he receiving any of these drugs did he find somebody who had one of these
[47:01.000 --> 47:06.920]  drugs and he just started taking it well that that's that's right I think the
[47:06.920 --> 47:12.440]  odds are when an adult in America today has what looks like a manic episode
[47:12.440 --> 47:17.080]  there's nothing weird bizarre overstimulated grandiose like running
[47:17.080 --> 47:21.320]  around naked out of the blue the odds are in America today was caused by an
[47:21.320 --> 47:28.200]  anti-depression because they commonly cause that behavior commonly cause that
[47:28.200 --> 47:35.480]  up to 20% of people on these drugs develop some kind of overstimulation and
[47:35.480 --> 47:40.680]  you know the data shows maybe five to 15% again I have something looks like a
[47:40.680 --> 47:48.640]  manic episode in their lifetime on these drugs very very high numbers and so now
[47:48.640 --> 47:54.400]  let's just let's just look at this for a second Peter we've got these drugs you
[47:54.400 --> 47:58.720]  know all over the place I mean the the numbers of prescriptions and the
[47:58.720 --> 48:03.240]  millions and millions and millions everywhere and then we have these crazy
[48:03.240 --> 48:10.640]  incidents of murder and violent activity and bizarre behavior you know
[48:10.640 --> 48:17.960]  cropping up all over the country and yet and yet the media becomes less and
[48:17.960 --> 48:25.480]  less able to or willing to even explore the possibility that any of these drugs
[48:25.480 --> 48:29.440]  are involved in any of these incidents and I've been told that the police don't
[48:29.440 --> 48:32.680]  want to get involved in this prosecutors don't get him want to get
[48:32.680 --> 48:36.880]  involved in this judges even don't want to get involved in this they don't want
[48:36.880 --> 48:43.640]  to touch this area they want to stay away from it your reaction to that
[48:43.640 --> 48:49.760]  well you know when when when when I wrote with ginger talking back to
[48:49.760 --> 48:55.880]  prozac in 1994 I was able to pull out and she was able to pull out of the
[48:55.880 --> 49:04.280]  media dozens and dozens of incidents of violence suicide may am where the media
[49:04.280 --> 49:10.400]  pinpointed that the person was taking prozac and then Lily and the drug
[49:10.400 --> 49:15.840]  companies have just slammed the door and the media now doesn't even want to
[49:15.840 --> 49:20.800]  ask literally no one's called me just because you're the first one got
[49:20.800 --> 49:25.920]  plenty of you know a call me right you know we've got the drugs have been
[49:25.920 --> 49:29.480]  involved and we don't know for sure but what would they have done and you know
[49:29.480 --> 49:34.520]  in his case we almost know for sure I'm getting calls now John is gonna blow you
[49:34.520 --> 49:42.120]  away I'm getting calls now from soldiers who are being refused deployments
[49:42.120 --> 49:48.680]  because they won't take psychiatric drugs from the army shrink is that right
[49:48.680 --> 49:54.640]  turning the world on its head that's how it used to be I was gonna say this to
[49:54.640 --> 49:58.400]  you Peter it used to be in the old days that if a kid wanted to go in the army
[49:58.400 --> 50:02.240]  he said that he'd been on Ritalin for example they wouldn't take him so now
[50:02.240 --> 50:06.360]  what you're saying is listen we have this armament of drugs that we're gonna
[50:06.360 --> 50:12.160]  pile on top of you including as you've documented the most toxic of all the
[50:12.160 --> 50:17.560]  anti-psychotics and if you won't take them we won't let you into the army well
[50:17.560 --> 50:26.040]  we won't let you go to war war won't you go to right the duty deployment
[50:26.040 --> 50:33.240]  Afghanistan if you won't take the drug I'm literally being consulted cases like
[50:33.240 --> 50:37.560]  that it's totally bizarre unbelievable this is John Rathport sitting in for

[54:56.800 --> 55:02.440]  talking peter where the army the air you know all the services are now as you
[55:02.440 --> 55:07.360]  said telling people hey if you want to go to war you've got to take psychiatric
[55:07.360 --> 55:13.640]  drugs and now the media is not reporting anymore at all on incidents of
[55:13.640 --> 55:19.280]  violence and suicide and so forth that may be or are connected psychiatric
[55:19.280 --> 55:24.560]  drugs because Eli Lilly and other companies have slammed the door so the
[55:24.560 --> 55:30.080]  media are now in the pocket completely of the pharmaceutical industry on this
[55:30.080 --> 55:37.400]  right yes it's much worse than it was five years ago or 10 or 15 the media is
[55:37.400 --> 55:43.160]  much much less gonna look at psychiatric drugs now it's really a bad
[55:43.160 --> 55:47.960]  situation and it's getting worse and worse it with 20% of women supposedly
[55:47.960 --> 55:55.000]  are taking antidepressants now I mean which are my huge figures it's a
[55:55.000 --> 56:00.400]  national tragedy and long-term these drugs are very bad for people I have a
[56:00.400 --> 56:04.800]  blog about this on Huffington Post if you just go to Bregen on Huffington Post
[56:04.800 --> 56:09.640]  go to my blog about long-term effects of antidepressants it's a national
[56:09.640 --> 56:16.080]  tragedy John and you are so to be praised for doing this show well we want
[56:16.080 --> 56:21.000]  to cover this for you know as many people as we possibly can so they are
[56:21.000 --> 56:26.160]  aware of this because the propaganda on this is of course pharmaceutical
[56:26.160 --> 56:29.600]  propaganda is always outstanding I mean they're gonna tell you that this is just
[56:29.600 --> 56:33.680]  the greatest thing in the world and that only rarely do we have problems and so
[56:33.680 --> 56:37.760]  on and so forth but what you've managed to point out Peter that is so important
[56:37.760 --> 56:42.600]  is that this is endemic I mean you're talking about long-term effects of these
[56:42.600 --> 56:47.400]  drugs and huge numbers in the population you're talking about basically
[56:47.400 --> 56:52.800]  lies that have been told to sell these drugs to present studies that appear to
[56:52.800 --> 56:58.040]  make them safe and effective when all of this is just a sham well it's a total
[56:58.040 --> 57:03.120]  sham I mean the drugs are only tested for four five six weeks by and large so
[57:03.120 --> 57:06.160]  when you're talking you need to take them for the rest of your life he's
[57:06.160 --> 57:14.280]  making it up wow did you hear that folks so the drugs are the studied are done
[57:14.280 --> 57:18.720]  for five six weeks the FDA approves them then the doctor tells the patient you
[57:18.720 --> 57:24.320]  have to take the drug for the rest of your life and this is science does not
[57:24.320 --> 57:29.640]  require John any studying of the adverse effects on the brain there's no
[57:29.640 --> 57:36.840]  neuropsychological testing or MRIs on animals or on people so they're just
[57:36.840 --> 57:41.760]  ignoring the fact that these psychoactive substances that are alien to the brain
[57:41.760 --> 57:48.840]  are going to have a negative impact on the brain unbelievable this is John
[57:48.840 --> 57:52.240]  Rappaport sitting in for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones show we have been
[57:52.240 --> 57:57.520]  privileged to grab a few minutes of valuable time from Dr. Peter Bragan
[57:57.520 --> 58:04.520]  again his website is bragan.com that's B-R-E-G-G-I-N thank you so much Peter as
[58:04.520 --> 58:08.800]  always it's a pleasure to talk to you John you are the best you are the best
[58:08.800 --> 58:13.320]  interviewer on this subject in the world thank you thank you so much Peter say

[58:42.400 --> 58:49.000]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:49.600 --> 58:54.040]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[58:54.040 --> 58:58.000]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that
[58:58.000 --> 59:01.600]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or
[59:01.600 --> 59:05.000]  gold it's true seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this
[59:05.000 --> 59:08.760]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at
[59:08.760 --> 59:13.200]  Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they
[59:13.200 --> 59:18.240]  call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient
[59:18.240 --> 59:21.960]  dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[59:21.960 --> 59:25.840]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to
[59:25.840 --> 59:30.840]  plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survivalseedbank.com

[59:41.880 --> 59:47.240]  remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item this
[59:47.240 --> 59:56.680]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com waging war on corruption Alex Jones on
[59:56.680 --> 01:00:00.560]  the GCN radio network
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:12.120]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does

[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:26.440]  Alex Jones this is John Rapport and San Diego sitting in for Alex Jones on the
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:32.080]  Alex Jones show we're talking medical murder we're talking medical cartel
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:39.520]  we're talking about a globalist agenda to make you a patient in the system from
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:47.000]  cradle to grave and dose you with toxic pharmaceuticals debilitate you and your
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:52.920]  children and the population all the way down the line to make you more malleable
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:58.720]  and easy to control that's the agenda folks in a nutshell what the medical
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:06.080]  system has done is taken the aspects of itself that produce good results for
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:10.040]  example emergency crisis trauma medicine you know you're lying on the
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:14.480]  street and you've been run over by a bus well somebody comes along with a glass
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:20.080]  of you know with herbs in it as opposed to the guys you know paramedics and they
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.560]  want to take you to the hospital and they put you back together again you're
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:29.480]  liable to say let's go to the hospital folks but they parlay that you see into
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:33.880]  saying that everything medical is just as good as we can do in putting you back
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:37.800]  together after you've been run over on the street everything is just as good
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:43.640]  long-term treatment for chronic diseases and treatment for brain problems and
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:48.920]  cancer and heart disease and all of this and prevention and vaccines and so on
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:54.120]  and so forth it's all just as good as we are good at putting you back together
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:58.360]  after you've been run down on the street that's their angle that's their play
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:03.840]  that's their con game that's their shell game you just heard dr. Peter Bragan
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:09.120]  one of the brilliant lights in the field talk about what's happening in the
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:15.720]  military now where people kids who want to go to war are being told you can't go
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.800]  to war unless you'll take the psychiatric drugs the drugs that have
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:26.160]  been shown time and time again by bregan and others to cause violent erratic
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:32.840]  suicidal homicidal behavior you want to see the relationship between Prozac and
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:39.080]  the other SSRI anti-depressants Olof Paxil and so on to violence and violent
[01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:44.560]  behavior and other long-term debilitating effects there's material all
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:54.120]  over the place and at bregan.com you can find much of that okay we're talking
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:03:01.080]  about Robert Bale the sergeant who is now accused of killing 16 civilians in
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:06.520]  Afghanistan you heard dr. Bragan talking about the pile-up of effects here from
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:13.880]  PTSD to the fourth deployment and also he brought up a fantastic point about
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:20.560]  how because he's handling some of these cases dr. Bragan a soldier during the day
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:27.440]  is being used to go into a village and help reconstruct a village and yet the
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:33.360]  soldier knows that at night some of the same people in that village he doesn't
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:37.160]  know who are going to turn against them because they really are Taliban and
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:42.680]  they're going to try to kill them this is a way to fight a war I mean I'm
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:47.640]  laughing because what else are you going to do I could scream this is a way to
[01:03:47.640 --> 01:03:55.160]  fight a war this is this is not a war this is an operation to gain control of
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:04:01.360]  resources as we are seeing with Africa calm all over the world where America
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:05.800]  and other of its allies are intruding this is about natural resources about
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:10.040]  rare earth minerals it's about oil pipelines it's about domination of the
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:17.560]  populace and under that heading what has been left out of the equation even in
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:23.880]  much alternative news under the heading of debilitation of the population is the
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:30.960]  ultimate agenda of the medical cartel and when showing you here step-by-step and
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.360]  degree by degree and we've got a lot more to go is that this is in fact
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:39.640]  debilitating and destructive to you your children and the population John

[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:07.440]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:11.760]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:15.240]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:20.480]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:24.520]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:29.280]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:17.680]  John Rappaport here sitting in for Alex Jones today on the Alex Jones show
[01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:25.800]  referring back to Dr. Braggins comments about the dangerous effects the
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:31.160]  violence inducing effects for example of certain psychiatric drugs and how
[01:08:31.160 --> 01:08:37.080]  widespread they are in the society you want to demoralize the society you want
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:43.880]  to put people into a state of fear confusion you want to debilitate a
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:49.400]  society you want to produce an operation like that that makes a society in the
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:56.000]  long run easier to take over by those elite forces who want to take it over
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:04.560]  there's the formula you plant seeds folks you plant seeds everywhere of these
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:11.360]  and other toxic drugs some of which induce violence and you stand back and
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:18.920]  you say let it roll let it roll boys let it roll and you watch what happens and
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:25.040]  things become more and more and more bizarre in that society weirdnesses
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:30.240]  pop up in the press of strange stories of people running naked out onto the
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.640]  street and killing other people unexplainably what is all this about
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.360]  and nobody knows the press doesn't want to say the press doesn't want to cover
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:44.520]  it the press doesn't want to investigate what I'm telling you is that's the
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:51.120]  formula you put enough of these pharmaceutical drugs into a society and
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.120]  that's what you will get and that's what we are seeing and here I will give you
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:02.280]  the proof right now okay screw in your brains real tight on this one
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:11.360]  Barbara Starfield doctor Johns Hopkins School of Public Health the year 2000 the
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:15.600]  journal the Journal of the American Medical Association so far the
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:22.920]  credentials are pristine mainstream conventional medicine perfect credentials
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:30.000]  July 26 2000 Journal of the American Medical Association Starfield writes a
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.960]  review called is US Health really the best in the world and in it she
[01:10:33.960 --> 01:10:39.280]  concludes the following that in the United States every year the medical
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:47.720]  system kills 225,000 people 119,000 of those in incidents and events related
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:54.880]  to hospitals and 106,000 a year like clockwork deaths every year in the
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:02.400]  United States from FDA approved pharmaceutical drugs drugs approved by
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:11.640]  the FDA as safe and effective killing 106,000 people in the US like clockwork
[01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:18.720]  every year and if you care to add that up you will see it comes to more than a
[01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:28.120]  million Americans per decade killed by FDA approved and certified pharmaceutical
[01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:46.320]  drugs okay chew on that chew on that chew on that perfect insider mainstream
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:52.840]  conventional down the middle of the road credentials the author the medical
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:12:02.960]  journal the publication and that's the report in the year 2000 every year FDA
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:08.800]  approved pharmaceutical drugs kill 106,000 people in the United States not
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:17.080]  even talking about maiming we're talking about killing and the medical system on
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:22.120]  the whole kills 225,000 people a year like clockwork in the United States that
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:30.680]  would be 2.25 million people a year I mean a decade 2.25 million people a
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:37.120]  decade you want to use the word holocaust you want to use the word genocide
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:42.480]  medical treatment is now the third leading cause of death in the United
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:47.960]  States behind heart disease and cancer and has been at least since the year 2000
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:56.720]  when this was published I've been broadcasting this fact all over the
[01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.760]  world for the last I don't know five years I introduced doctor I interviewed
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:06.240]  Dr. Starfield one of the last interviews she did before she died in 2011 I
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:13.600]  said to her after you published your article in the year 2000 and cited those
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:21.920]  statistics did anybody from the FDA ever contact you for assistance in trying to
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:27.440]  correct the situation this was an email interview and she wrote back no in
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:31.720]  capital letters and oh anybody from the government get back to you and say we
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.880]  need your help we have to fix this no are you aware of any efforts for
[01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:43.440]  media efforts by the government after all it's the FDA which is an executive
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:50.000]  agency of the federal government that says these drugs are safe any effort
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:59.440]  that you know of by the government to fix this no no did your paper when you
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:03.280]  published it in the journaling American Medical Association received any
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:12.160]  overwhelming criticism no it was given in a sense the silent treatment there
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:16.240]  were stories in the media at the time but they went away eventually Starfield
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:20.960]  over the years continued to get at least she said one request a week for a
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:26.080]  copy of that paper but the media were absolutely silent and we'll get to the
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:30.400]  reasons why of course we know all about advertising revenue from pharmaceutical
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:34.240]  companies yes yes yes but there are deeper reasons for media silence on this
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:40.040]  because when you think about it this is a gigantic story even just from the
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:45.160]  story point of view I'm a reporter okay I know a story when I see it you know a
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:54.640]  story when you see it this drives me crazy this drives me crazy if the New
[01:14:54.640 --> 01:14:59.440]  York Times or the Washington Post or any other major U.S. paper that is in fact
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:09.440]  going down the toilet and they are wanted to resurrect their species on this
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.480]  planet all they would have to do is climb on this story that I'm feeding you
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:22.360]  here right now over a million people per decade killed in the United States by
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:28.520]  FDA approved pharmaceutical drugs on an ongoing basis you don't think that that
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:34.880]  story could be run three or four times a day in print editions on newsstands with
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:39.640]  interviews doctors coming out of the closet admitting I knew I knew I knew
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:45.320]  and I did nothing and I feel so horrible now and FDA people saying I tried to warn
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:48.400]  the head of the FDA that this was happening it wouldn't listen to me I
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:55.880]  was sidelined the president saying I don't know anything about this all manner
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:01.600]  of people emerging out of the woodwork I can look into the future and see this
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:07.600]  story playing out in unbelievable ways over the next three four years you could
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:12.440]  pound on this sucker every day in a major newspaper like the Washington Post
[01:16:12.440 --> 01:16:18.960]  would make their Watergate investigation look like looking into theft in a candy
[01:16:18.960 --> 01:16:26.440]  store every day new information new things come out new people talk new
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:34.160]  doctors show up and on top of this you see doctors are claiming we don't know
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.040]  anything about this your medical doctors saying hey I don't know anything
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:42.840]  about this I can't believe this couldn't be true as you sit there and say your
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:47.480]  doctor hey by the way Sam I just want to let you know that there's a paper that
[01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:51.240]  was published on July 26 2000 the Journal of Medical American Medical Association
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:17:00.120]  by Dr. Barbara Starfield that stated in no uncertain terms that FDA approved
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:05.000]  pharmaceuticals kill 106,000 people a year in the United States every year
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.840]  oh that's ridiculous if that were true I would have heard about it yes really is
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:16.080]  that so is that really so are we willing to accept that excuse from doctors
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:23.720]  anymore I don't know let's suppose that you were I don't know a cab driver in
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.000]  New York City okay here's a good analogy for you getting down to its folks
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:33.480]  106,000 people a year killed in the United States every year by FDA approved
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:39.280]  pharmaceutical drugs and a total of 225,000 from all effects of the medical
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:44.520]  system third leading cause of death in the United States not being explored by
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:50.360]  the media you want to know what pharmaceutical and medical warfare staged
[01:17:50.360 --> 01:17:57.280]  by the cartel against the global population is all about and we're not
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:02.440]  even talking about debilitation or maiming or mutilation here we're talking
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:13.160]  about DETH death and I'm citing the authoritative paper on the subject okay
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:20.280]  it's warfare against the population to destroy and debilitate the society to
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.360]  make it more controllable and easy for takeover and there are people at the
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:28.840]  top of the medical cartel who know very well what they are doing everybody
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:32.880]  else is playing along for whatever their reasons and if anybody comes up to you
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:36.360]  and says well you can't have a conspiracy unless you would have
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:41.440]  thousands and thousands of people let know about it baloney everybody plays
[01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:46.320]  his part for his own reasons that's how you get a conspiracy only a few people
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:50.040]  really have to understand and know of course there has to be a lot of lying
[01:18:50.040 --> 01:18:55.560]  that goes on and I'll be talking to you about more of that later but anyway
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:59.240]  you're driving a cab in New York City and a guy gets into your cab and says
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:03.080]  take me uptown to Times Square and he says by the way have you heard about the
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:06.600]  cabbie down in the village that mowed down six people this morning you say
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:11.560]  gee no I haven't you really and he said not only that but up in the Bronx there
[01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:16.000]  was a cabbie that drove his car with three passengers out of some kind of a
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.680]  parking garage 16 stories down to the street and there was another cabbie over
[01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:24.840]  in Staten Island who started shooting people and this all happened when you
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:31.880]  say you're the cabbie this morning this morning yeah this morning why don't you
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.360]  know mr. cabbie we'll find out the answer to that question and what it has to

[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:15.240]  gold grind this is John Rappaport sitting in for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:20.160]  show before we went to break I was just talking about a story which I'll
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.480]  telescope here if you were a cabbie in New York City and you suddenly learned
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:29.640]  that there were cabbies all around you committing violence you would be aware
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:32.880]  of it people would let you know even if it wasn't in the newspapers and so if you
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:38.440]  say the doctors don't really know that the medical profession via pharmaceuticals
[01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:42.680]  is killing 106,000 Americans a year they don't know they're not aware of it
[01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:49.640]  they're entirely innocent come on come on come on come on okay we've got more on
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:55.680]  that later on but Sweden Sweden is in the news folks because guess what they're
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:25:01.000]  doing they're going to eliminate cash isn't that wonderful they're moving
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.200]  into a cashless society apparently they've been ruthlessly getting off of
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.440]  cash for years and years I think they're down to about 3% of all
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:15.120]  transactions now involved cash and now they're saying hey let's eliminate it
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:22.880]  all together why cost of printing oh yeah gee and people scratch their heads
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:28.240]  and they say oh yeah that sounds great because the society should first of all
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:33.000]  think about the cost of printing this is the most important thing in the
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:37.440]  universe is the cost to printing money and if we can eliminate that it doesn't
[01:25:37.440 --> 01:25:42.120]  really matter what we do right this is the way they're presenting this
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:46.840]  completely absurd right and the other thing is we'll eliminate bank robberies
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:52.160]  and cash robberies oh yeah sure you will absolutely because there'll be no cash
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:59.520]  around but at the same time the cyber crime rate will skyrocket so this is a
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:03.120]  completely bogus cover story what they're moving toward is a cashless
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:09.080]  society for one reason so that's a government and the forces of super
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:16.960]  national government globalism can control money and control your money
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:24.200]  they know what you spend everywhere you go what you do where it goes ha ha ha
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:31.240]  they've got you they've got you that's what a cash society cashless society is
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:36.280]  all about that's why Sweden is in the forefront of this because they're
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:40.600]  basically saying to the world you're going to catch up to us soon we're in
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:45.080]  the vanguard this is progressive this is wonderful yeah it's wonderful if you
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:51.320]  want the government to be able to say that you spent three cents in Dubuque
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:58.240]  Iowa on New Year's Eve and they got it tracked exactly because that is in fact
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:03.400]  what is going to happen and I'm not being paranoid I'm being very factual
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:08.640]  that's what the system is for now speaking of prices of course gas prices
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:13.160]  are going up through the roof which is exactly what Obama wants oh did I say
[01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:20.240]  that because he said why would I even think of running to be elected if at
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:25.120]  the same time I were forcing up gas prices that's ridiculous no trade not
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:30.600]  ever since the Arab Spring broke out in Egypt I've been writing and telling
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:34.800]  people you know folks this has a lot to do with the price of oil don't forget
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:38.880]  that this has a lot to do with the price of oil for everything else that it has
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:44.040]  to do with including domination of resources and people and so on by
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:51.040]  globalist invading troops and terrorists thugs it has to do with the
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:57.680]  price of oil in raising the price of oil because the price of oil is dependent
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:04.360]  upon quote perception about oil which in turn is regulated by what Nidia says
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:10.000]  about perception about oil yeah it's that insane oh yes the price of oil is
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:14.160]  going up again today because obviously of the turmoil in the Middle East I saw
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:19.680]  these headlines on and on and on what turmoil no straights or canals were
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:23.560]  being threatened nothing was happening but there was enough of an appearance you
[01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:27.640]  see of turmoil to start the ball rolling and that happened in Egypt and it's been
[01:28:27.640 --> 01:28:31.520]  going on ever since and now we have the threats we'll cut off the canal we'll
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.960]  do this and the price keeps on rising and why is this part of Obama's agenda
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:41.960]  which is to say simply the globalist agenda because Obama Bush whoever
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:47.280]  Clinton doesn't matter this is the globalist agenda because of course we
[01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:54.600]  can move into Greenville and Green City we can now say well guess what we've
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:59.880]  got all kinds of alternative energies now like windmills that we can set up
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:03.600]  everywhere that are suddenly cost-effective because now that it
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:09.360]  costs ten dollars to buy a gallon of gas at the pump well you could blow through
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:13.400]  a tube in your house and produce energy that would be useful because it costs
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:21.800]  ten dollars a gallon of the pump this green agenda includes cap and trade

[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:28.440]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the

[01:33:58.560 --> 01:34:03.120]  the language to show you exactly what it means between the lines behind the
[01:34:03.120 --> 01:34:07.120]  scenes so despite what they're saying publicly we want you to understand what
[01:34:07.120 --> 01:34:11.680]  it really means underneath all that behind the curtain so to speak also we've
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:17.120]  got some breaking news about the raw some foods raid and the the legal
[01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:20.920]  persecution of James Stewart we've got an inside update coming up that I'll
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:24.920]  share with you it's it's brief it's not a huge breaking story yet but it is some
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:28.800]  detail that you want to hear about we've got all of that plus a discussion
[01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:33.600]  between myself and John Rapport who's hosting today at the top of the next
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:37.080]  hour so stay with us we've got all that coming up here on the Alex Jones show
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:43.880]  back to you John thanks very much Mike we'll see in the next hour Mike is a
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:49.880]  great guy and a great pioneer for the 21st century in the issue of health
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:58.080]  freedom we're talking about gas prices in the last segment when the gas prices
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:04.440]  get high enough all sorts of things become economically viable you know you
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:09.280]  can have bizarre contraptions that would not be cost-effective you know in any
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:14.800]  same site and all of a sudden hey we got $12 gas all sorts of things work but
[01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:19.480]  the real danger of course is what they're calling cap and trade this is the
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:28.160]  idea that coming in behind gas prices the globalists can initiate a fake a
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:34.720]  fake I underline that green objective to limit industrial production on the
[01:35:34.720 --> 01:35:38.960]  planet to such a degree that it drives people out of business all over the
[01:35:38.960 --> 01:35:44.080]  place and bankrupts companies and then the elite corporations mind you stay
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:52.320]  out of it they are fine because they can trade and buy pollution credits under
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:58.440]  whatever name they're listed they get exemptions they get waivers we've seen
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:03.720]  with Obamacare they get all kinds of exclusions that allow them to keep on
[01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:08.320]  doing exactly what they're doing under the guise of these treaty agreements
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:14.240]  like NAFTA and CAFTA World Trade Organization they roam the planet at
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:19.880]  will destroy whatever is in their path they can bring in intelligence services
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:25.040]  and they do and they can bring in troops and they do they can bring in all
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:30.120]  kinds of forward deployment in order to make their conquest of populations that
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:36.520]  we're seeing now throughout the Middle East and in Africa work for them because
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:42.520]  they want the resources they want the rare earth minerals that China is now
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:46.680]  saying hey we're gonna hold back on shipping rare earth minerals that makes
[01:36:46.680 --> 01:36:51.120]  it even more urgent to go into Africa under the guise of humanitarian aid
[01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:57.920]  we're here to help you yes it's medical care it's this rebuilding we care we're
[01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:03.040]  concerned we want to give you a glass of water a shot of a vaccine whatever to
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:09.000]  make it look good but under the surface it's all about conquest mega corporate
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:17.040]  mega globalist conquest on the continent of Africa on any continent that has the
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:26.120]  resources and the labor not so important to the globalists not so important it's
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:32.320]  mainly we want the land we want the resources that's the way it works hope
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:39.000]  you understand that hope you really get the picture of how this operates because
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.160]  can you think of anything more ridiculous than a man in a white coat with a
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:49.840]  lot of drugs and medicines getting off a plane somewhere in Africa as if he's a
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:55.240]  hero and going into a village saying gonna save all of you people yeah save
[01:37:55.240 --> 01:38:00.280]  us from what with what well with my medicines and my vaccines really is that
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:04.360]  right well let me tell you something folks just between you and me okay just
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:09.360]  between you and me what's been killing Africa and every poverty strickened area
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:15.040]  of the world since the beginning of time is contaminated water supplies
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:24.400]  starvation generation to generation overcrowding lack of basic sanitation you
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:27.040]  want to learn something about the history of health and medicine in the
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:31.400]  West that's what you learn when you eliminate those for real forget the
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:35.440]  medicines and the vaccines when you eliminate those you bring about a state
[01:38:35.440 --> 01:38:40.120]  of health then you show you care then you are concerned then you are
[01:38:40.120 --> 01:38:44.800]  contributing something to welfare of people that's not what's happening in
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:48.680]  Africa not what's happening in Latin America so it's happening anywhere in
[01:38:48.680 --> 01:38:57.360]  the world in any poor country because why because if you maintain dirty
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:39:01.760]  contaminated water and overcrowding and lack of sanitation and so on what do
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.480]  you get you get debilitation you get weakness and you get deaf easier to
[01:39:05.480 --> 01:39:10.240]  control easier to control it's all part of the operation folks there's the
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:14.840]  military aspect of the operation of going in there and securing the resources
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:21.040]  through some phony war the stage between two sides and there's the medical
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:25.200]  aspect and you better believe it and if you don't understand the importance of
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:32.400]  the medical aspect you're not clued in you don't really have a clue okay
[01:39:32.400 --> 01:39:36.560]  Obama has been making all kinds of declarations recently and Mike and I are
[01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:41.560]  going to discuss that in the hour upcoming but there are some things to
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:46.600]  say about this executive order updated yes we know that Bush issued a very
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:51.480]  similar order this is only making a few changes and Clinton did and so forth
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:40:00.560]  okay but it's a basic reiteration of the power of the president which means the
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:06.560]  ruling authority to whom the president owes his allegiance to basically control
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:11.600]  all of the resources the country and destroy the country we can arrest you
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:15.560]  we can kill you if we decide that you're a combatant that's already been
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:20.840]  established and in this executive order what is completely blurred over most
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:24.840]  recent executive order is the difference between peace and war you see
[01:40:24.840 --> 01:40:28.840]  because emergency measures that were announced in the executive order had to
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:34.480]  do with things like oh we can take over industries for military production and
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:38.960]  so on and so forth running through the entire society what can be taken over
[01:40:38.960 --> 01:40:47.320]  by the government we saw some of this in World War two but now it's blurred over
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:51.480]  as to what the differences between war and peace what are we talking about here
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:58.240]  doesn't matter government can move in at any time and take this over absolutely
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:04.120]  how do you like that and as we move up the line into the future this article by
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:10.880]  the way several articles on this at info wars.com so you need to read those as we
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:14.680]  move up the line into the future which one of these articles points out we're
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:19.320]  going to see more and more of this encroachment you know are we saying that
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:24.600]  tomorrow Obama is suddenly going to say guess what the entire transport
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:28.800]  industry of the United States is under control the military which is under my
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:35.920]  control we're not saying that this is the door is opening to this operation
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:42.240]  which can move very quickly if a situation is provoked make no mistake
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:48.360]  about that how about a phony epidemic boom now we got to take over okay we're
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:53.720]  going to make a ring around this city yeah we're going to quarantine Cincinnati
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:58.800]  how about that and the government is going to take over all aspects of business
[01:41:58.800 --> 01:42:03.200]  and industry that has any bearing on this city because we can because we have
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:12.560]  this recent executive order that's what we're talking about all of this rolls up
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:19.280]  over time it becomes more and more intrusive invasive and destructive
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:25.640]  that's what this is about while you're being distracted by all kinds of stories
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:33.920]  this is what's happening this is what's happening behind the scenes okay so I
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:41.040]  gave you the stats on medical death in the United States I could hammer that
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:45.320]  for the next six hours if I were on here really I mean you know they have to put
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.440]  me in restraints so I don't do that because this is what people don't
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:59.240]  understand but what lies up the road for you in this health insurance national
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:04.640]  health insurance mandatory scheme if it remains is that you will be forced to
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:09.080]  take many of these drugs that kill people at this alarming rate in America
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:14.600]  every year I mean that's the bottom line as far as you and your family is
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:20.360]  concerned you understand what I'm saying there I mean I hope you do I hope you do
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:25.840]  I hope you really do right and then of course there's a question well wait
[01:43:25.840 --> 01:43:31.600]  doesn't the FDA certify all new drugs is safe and effective how could they
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:36.560]  allow these drugs that are killing people at the rate of 106,000 a year in
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:40.960]  the United States to enter into the mainstream and be prescribed by doctors
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:46.280]  because they're responsible to certify these drugs is safe and effective well
[01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:52.640]  there's a thing called faking medical reality okay which is connected with
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:56.920]  published studies on the safety and effectiveness of the drugs and we'll be
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:44:01.520]  getting into how that reality is faked to make it look as if these drugs are
[01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:06.160]  safe and effective when actually they're naming and killing people I mean maybe
[01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:09.560]  you don't think this is important I think this is one of the most important
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:15.680]  things in the world it's political don't you see it's political it's not
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:24.760]  medical it's not medical you kill one person with a drug a thousand people a
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:29.560]  hundred thousand people that's political and you better get used to
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:34.560]  understanding that that's crossing the lines from medical to political that's
[01:44:34.560 --> 01:44:40.400]  murder that's an operation an ongoing operation to debilitate and destroy
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:50.560]  families communities people's lives their children's lives in this country
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:58.640]  that's what that is okay I guess you understand that I hope you do I really
[01:44:58.640 --> 01:45:10.400]  do I want to read you a quote here this is from a woman named Marcia Angel or
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:18.480]  Angle MD who was the editor of the New England Journal of Medicine which is the
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:23.320]  most prestigious medical journal in the world okay she was the boss over there
[01:45:23.320 --> 01:45:30.040]  for two decades and this is what she writes it is simply no longer possible
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:37.080]  to believe much of the clinical research that is published or to rely on the
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:42.320]  judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines I take
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:47.440]  no pleasure in this conclusion which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:53.560]  two decades as an editor of the New England Journal of Medicine it is
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:58.560]  simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:06.640]  published she means in her own journal in other journals mainstream the most
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:12.040]  influential journals that dictate to the press what the press and media say
[01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:17.160]  about medicine and the effect of medicine on life in this country it is no
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:24.400]  longer possible to believe the research that is published this means research
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:29.040]  on drugs new drugs folks on the drugs that these drug companies want to
[01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:36.080]  foist upon you the research that they do that is printed in these journals that
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:41.280]  the FDA looks at that turns out to be fake research that's what she's saying
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:50.120]  it's no longer possible to believe it because it's faked I'll describe a little
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:59.880]  of that as we go on here okay back to politics what's happening in breaking
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:07.560]  news these days in the country we have a race to the top the horse race to the
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:12.780]  White House right we have the Republicans we have the demos we have no
[01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:19.560]  independences time around that anybody can observe with a microscope we have
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:26.160]  these people arguing among themselves and self-destructing and so on anyone
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:34.040]  speaking about any of this material that we're covering here today no not that
[01:47:34.040 --> 01:47:41.440]  I'm aware of Ron Paul whose doctor may be speaking about some of it instead what
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:47.120]  they're talking about is I'm tough no I'm tougher no I'll be even tougher if
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:52.680]  you elect me this is all mind control folks this is all about image making on
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:58.440]  all sides Democrats Republicans who can put up the image that is going to click
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:04.280]  the counter in the brain of people and force them to go to the polls and say
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:08.800]  this is the guy that I want I mean talk about current news have you been
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:15.920]  watching the debates as they play out over the last several months it's all
[01:48:15.920 --> 01:48:21.560]  about operant conditioning to condition citizens of this country who are voting
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:26.040]  into how to look at the faces that appear on the screen is it going to be a
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:31.600]  positive react or negative react if the candidate says this in a certain kind of
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:36.880]  way is it going to create a positive effect or a negative effect and how
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:40.800]  about the makeup and how about the suit and how about the tie and what is the
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.720]  message that you've got to get across tonight his advisors around him that
[01:48:45.720 --> 01:48:49.320]  you're tough that you're tougher that you're tougher than tougher than tougher
[01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:55.240]  or that you're kindler and gentler or that in fact you're wiser politically
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:59.320]  speaking or you've got to get the impression governor that you're the
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:03.360]  front-runner because you are and so you got to be a little bit more casual you
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:08.080]  can't be as you know hyped up let the other guys be hyped up because you're
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.400]  standing back there and you're winning you see and all of this is going on and
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:16.720]  on and on and on and on and then the television gets into the act and the
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:22.040]  image is made and the image hits the eye and hits the brain and there are
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:26.640]  researchers and think tanks all over america political researchers and so on
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:32.480]  and consultants who are looking at this material and the country is going down
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:41.600]  the toilet countries going down the toilet while this PR bizarro goes on
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:49.000]  because nobody is willing to blow the whistle blow the whistle on what suppose
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:54.520]  obama stood up tomorrow and said I've got the notes here somewhere to prove it
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:50:04.840]  but I think I remember the figures yes 11 percent of members of the
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:15.200]  trilateral commission were appointed by Obama to his administration 11 percent
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:22.480]  of the American membership of the trilateral Commission were appointed
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:26.400]  by Obama within what 10 days of his being elected and saying that he was
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:31.080]  independent this is a different administration this is a revolution this
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:34.560]  is hope and change we're not going to do good we're not going to do government
[01:50:34.560 --> 01:50:39.760]  the same way 87 members of the trilateral Commission exist in the United
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:44.320]  States and 11 percent were appointed by Obama as John Rappaport sitting in
[01:50:44.320 --> 01:50:49.400]  relics Jones will be back after the break don't go anywhere
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:05.680]  you don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis everyone
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:11.000]  can feel it we know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:16.600]  of freedom and those who love darkness bondage and enslavement yes my friends
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:22.480]  evil is rising but take heart for every action there is an equal and
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:26.920]  opposite reaction recently new world order operative Hillary Clinton admitted

[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:14.080]  can look at my website no more fake news dot com for some of these stories I'm
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:19.960]  talking about here and other material talking about the trilateral Commission
[01:54:19.960 --> 01:54:25.200]  which is one of the elite organizations on the planet many of you know about it
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:30.840]  formed in 1973 by David Rockefeller basically to bring together Western
[01:54:30.840 --> 01:54:36.240]  Europe US and Japan now has expanded the statement was to create a new
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:43.040]  international economic order that was the founding statement now here we are
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:46.760]  in the middle of you know presidential campaign Obama has not swung into gear
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:55.400]  yet but he is connected because he's appointed 11 of the 87 trilateral
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:54:59.400]  members in the United States to post in his administration that's pretty
[01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:05.000]  incredible there's only 87 members of this Commission which is a completely
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:10.960]  globalist force okay designed to eliminate national sovereignty and
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:19.000]  borders to change the nature of money talk about the cashless society to
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:26.720]  control governments internationally and he's got 11 of these guys out of 87
[01:55:26.720 --> 01:55:30.680]  members in the country in his administration Tim Geisner secretary
[01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:35.080]  of Treasury national security advisor general James Jones chairman of the
[01:55:35.080 --> 01:55:40.200]  economic recovery committee Paul Walker director of national intelligence
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:48.320]  Dennis Blair etc etc etc well this needs to be covered I mean kidding needs to be
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:55.080]  covered absolutely needs to be covered because that's why no candidate is going
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:56:02.400]  to step up during this campaign and say I oppose globalism I want to end the
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:11.520]  super international control of America or of any nation because that control
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:20.720]  involves destruction of the people co-option of the resources of the country
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:26.440]  and enslaving the population over a long term basis and allowing mega
[01:56:26.440 --> 01:56:31.520]  corporations to run free and roam the planet to be exempt from any of this
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:37.040]  until they become the only existing centers of quote light in the darkness
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:46.280]  where anybody can find help yeah strange kind of help a in a society that
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:51.360]  isn't going increasingly down the tubes poverty-stricken because those are
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:58.840]  easier to control no candidate is going to step up and say that because in those
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:05.560]  terms I mean candidate with a significant chance of winning who is a
[01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:12.480]  front-runner potential in their party is going to dare to say that certainly not
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:18.200]  in these terms because that's blowing the whistle on his own masters and
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:21.920]  that's what we've got to get straight here it doesn't matter which way we go
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:28.120]  cashless society in Sweden that's an operation that's not just Sweden deciding
[01:57:28.120 --> 01:57:34.000]  we'd like to go cashless no that's look world we can make it work and so can you
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:43.040]  and now you can be completely watched and tracked and surveyed and you will be

[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:36.400]  their homes where toasters and refrigerators and stoves and ovens and

[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:49.440]  need to get into that but the thing that interested me in the story was that
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:56.840]  Petraeus who is you know head of CIA was talking about this at a conference of
[02:01:56.840 --> 02:02:01.840]  in Q tell in Q tell is an investment company actually illegal investment
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:06.120]  company owned by the CIA what's the government doing in owning companies but
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:12.720]  anyway it owns in Q tell and they finance all sorts of companies like IT
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:17.840]  companies in Silicon Valley to come up with new developments that CIA then can
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:23.360]  use and in Q tell is coming up with these smart appliances well a guy named
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:27.840]  buzzy Cron guard was instrumental for creating in Q tell with along with
[02:02:27.840 --> 02:02:33.640]  George tenon the CIA and buzzy Cron guard Cron guard was in fact the head of
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:39.000]  Alex Brown one of the biggest investment banker houses in the country that was
[02:02:39.000 --> 02:02:43.160]  discovered in the San Francisco Chronicle article to have been one of those
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:49.600]  outfits that was trading stock precipitously in American Airlines just
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:55.400]  before 9 11 so that's following something down the rabbit hole just thought
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:03:01.080]  you might want to know so Mike let's jump in and give us your top issue of
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:04.240]  the day well hey these you know commenting on what you just said there
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:08.040]  these ties are always very deep on every issue look at the TSA look who's
[02:03:08.040 --> 02:03:13.120]  making money from the selling of the naked body scanners you know follow the
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:17.480]  money who benefits from the propaganda who benefits from the deception it's
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:23.280]  always that these people in power sort of buddies of the White House regardless
[02:03:23.280 --> 02:03:27.000]  of who's in the White House whether it's Bush or Obama or Clinton or whoever I
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:33.000]  mean look at the the failure of the green solar companies these are people
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:36.720]  who were buddies of Obama who took hundreds of millions of dollars in
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:42.120]  government grant money paid themselves huge fat salaries as CEOs never produced
[02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:45.640]  a product never produced a service and then went bankrupt it's just another
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:50.840]  form of government theft it's just like John Corzine it's just like the banks
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:55.440]  to bailouts of Goldman Sachs it's it's just theft at every single level and
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:59.120]  the one thing all these thefts have in common is they're all close buddies with
[02:03:59.120 --> 02:04:04.560]  the White House indeed they are and organizations like the Trilateral
[02:04:04.560 --> 02:04:08.240]  Commission and of course the Council on Foreign Relations headquartered in New
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:16.280]  York created 1920 these are a couple of the elite crony buddy buddy nudge nudge
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:22.840]  wink wink old boys clubs where all of this theft is planned and takes place
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:27.040]  and interestingly both of these organizations Trilateral Commission and
[02:04:27.040 --> 02:04:34.120]  CFR go back to the Rockefeller Monopoly and at the same time that all these
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:37.960]  thefts are taking place the regular people the people working for a living
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:41.400]  who are breaking their backs to try to get ahead their money keeps getting
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:45.960]  stolen from them and they're prosecuted for crimes like selling raw milk so
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:50.360]  there's this this two-tiered system where regular everyday people can't get
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:54.160]  ahead they're criminalized for everything where meanwhile the real
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:57.720]  criminals in Washington run free and steal everything we got to go to a break
[02:04:57.720 --> 02:05:01.120]  we're gonna cover this for awesome right after this John Appaport for Alex
[02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:05.840]  John a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty
[02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:09.400]  good-sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:13.480]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:16.880]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:21.680]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[02:05:21.680 --> 02:05:26.160]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:30.960]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:13.600]  Rafferport in for Alex Jones today on the Alex Jones show with Mike Adams the
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:19.600]  health ranger okay Mike the Rossum story this is we're talking before the break
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:25.720]  a perfect illustration of how the little guy gets through the hard-working
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:30.360]  person who's trying to do something good for himself his family and other
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:36.840]  people is getting completely demolished so go for it we've got a lot of inside
[02:08:36.840 --> 02:08:40.720]  information here let me let me brief you all on on the latest we thought we
[02:08:40.720 --> 02:08:45.120]  might have James Stewart he's the operator of Rossum foods in California
[02:08:45.120 --> 02:08:49.800]  who was raided and arrested a gunpoint last year we thought we might have him
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:54.560]  on today but it turns out he's not available because the Ventura County
[02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:59.040]  has him in a three-day preliminary hearing it's just a preliminary hearing
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:04.680]  but it's taking three days he had he's being persecuted charged with 38 felony
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:09.920]  counts of financial crimes that we have investigated and it turns out he factually
[02:09:09.920 --> 02:09:15.000]  has nothing to do whatsoever with these so-called financial crimes and if you
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:20.320]  look at the the financial crimes what are they well Ventura County claims that
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:24.120]  Sharon Palmer the owner of healthy family farms or the original owner I
[02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:29.520]  should say their other owners involved she was unable to repay investors on
[02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:34.880]  time because she was paying fines to the county and she was paying literally
[02:09:34.880 --> 02:09:38.400]  hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees because the county was raiding
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:43.800]  the farm and throwing her in jail so the county came in put her behind schedule
[02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:48.840]  on paying back the investors and then they charged her with felony crimes of
[02:09:48.840 --> 02:09:52.960]  defrauding the investors because she was late repaying them which the county
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:59.320]  caused wow here's a case of the state putting you in a position that
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:04.680]  then they call criminality and then charging you with 38 felony crimes now
[02:10:04.680 --> 02:10:11.320]  compare this John with what has happened to John Corzine of MF global who stole
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:16.560]  billions of dollars from farmers all across America who had invested in that
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:21.400]  fund to try to reduce their risk as they grow crops you know farmers invest in
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:27.200]  in the crop futures to reduce their risk of crop failures and so on and he
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:32.320]  nothing has happened to him no project I don't know where the money is we just
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:36.280]  don't know where the money is right yeah we don't know where the money is I
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:39.680]  apologize I have a little bit difficult hearing you come in when I'm when I'm
[02:10:39.680 --> 02:10:45.000]  talking but it's it's a case of selective prosecution and selective
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:51.080]  criminalization of individual farmers while the big rich fat cats get away
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:58.280]  with massive theft once again now James Stewart of Rossum I mean this is just
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:03.080]  an incredible story to me the guy is selling raw milk his customers are
[02:11:03.080 --> 02:11:07.880]  happy they love the milk he keeps selling them the milk all of a sudden he
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:13.920]  gets rated now from what you're saying is it true that they're not now charging
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:17.840]  him with selling raw milk or contaminated milk that all of these
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:24.280]  charges are quote about financial crimes it is both John they're still
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:28.920]  charging him with quotes selling unpasteurized milk which he wasn't even
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:32.480]  doing he actually didn't even run a retail store it was a private buyers
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:37.600]  club a co-op everybody was a partial owner of a cow and of a farm and they
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:41.320]  were merely picking up the milk they already owned it's basic contract law
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:45.600]  under under common law but California has attacked that and said that that's
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:50.640]  that's not valid under under under their state laws but now they've added on the
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:54.520]  financial crimes on top of that and remember Ventura County arrested him
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:59.760]  when he was in court a couple of weeks ago and then they tortured him in the LA
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:04.840]  County prison the LA County jail it's called believe the name of this jail
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:09.520]  believe it or not is called Twin Towers yeah that's the other than this
[02:12:09.520 --> 02:12:14.480]  problem in the environment downtown LA I've been there downtown LA and they
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:18.320]  subjected him to starvation to hypothermia they shackled him with
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:23.480]  change three or four times around his waist they subjected him to medical
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:29.080]  procedures without his permission and he nearly died of hypothermia shivering in
[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:34.080]  isolation in a cell and he was lost in the system for eight days this is the
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:37.200]  way they treat farmers in America today this is what's happening to James
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:41.320]  Stewart we've documented it and more on this is coming out and we will be
[02:12:41.320 --> 02:12:45.600]  sharing that documentation with Kurt Nemo Alex Jones Paul Joseph Watson and
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:50.360]  the whole team there at infant wars yeah I'm looking for stories to keep on
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:55.120]  showing up on this and you know the other thing of course that James said
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:13:03.280]  was that in the final hours at the LA County jail somebody in that cell block
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:10.240]  that area released horrendous sewage that came flooding into the cells an
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:15.800]  inch or two deep on the floors in the cells that contained feces and other
[02:13:15.800 --> 02:13:21.720]  horrendous material and his shirt was there I mean he was already freezing and
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:27.440]  he was given a filthy mop and told you know to clean it up himself yes I mean
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:36.040]  this is just unbelievable well think about the irony the sick almost pathetic
[02:13:36.040 --> 02:13:40.480]  devilish irony of all this the state is charging him with crimes for selling
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:46.240]  milk with living bacteria which we call probiotics it's good for you but the
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:50.360]  state says it's unsanitary therefore you're a criminal and what do they do
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:55.880]  they throw him in a jail where they flood his jail cell with raw sewage which of
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:14:01.360]  course is is heavily contaminated with dangerous and deadly pathogens and they
[02:14:01.360 --> 02:14:05.040]  say this is justice this is what the state says and they did make him clean
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:09.520]  out his own cell of raw sewage by hand they actually gave him a small squeegee
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:14.200]  and then after he had squeegee'd out the raw sewage out of his jail cell they
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:19.720]  then left him in that cell for another 30 plus hours and I also confirmed the
[02:14:19.720 --> 02:14:25.040]  story with a former LA cop I don't want to release his name yet but he confirmed
[02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:30.160]  with me that this is not only happening that this is not only a true story but
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:40.240]  that this is routine in the LA jail system John I agree it's routine James
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:46.400]  mentioned the other day that he was at a conference where he was able to talk to
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:50.880]  a few sheriffs from different parts of the country and he told them that he
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:14:55.000]  lived in LA told them this what had happened to him and basically one sheriff
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:04.240]  just said move yeah move this is this happens this happens in LA this is not
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:09.840]  just James but we have to keep in mind that you know James was a guy who was
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:14.680]  arrested for selling healthy milk really I mean that was why he was arrested
[02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:20.000]  that was why he was raided that was the genesis of the whole thing and so this is
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:24.180]  what he subjected to and you're right it's perfect it's like saying okay so you
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:29.560]  claim to have milk that's free of contamination with all these organisms so
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:33.560]  we're now going to flood you with the most contaminated organisms we can find
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:36.880]  yeah and think about how much bail was said in this case by the way John
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:41.480]  Ventura County slapped him with one million dollars in bail and they slapped
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:45.280]  Sharon Palmer with two million dollars in bail now now look at how this is
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:50.680]  selectively applied look at the case of the Penn State assistant coaches there
[02:15:50.680 --> 02:15:56.560]  who who are were reportedly involved in child rape and pimping out children for
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:01.880]  sex favors to you know wealthy clients in that area come complete sicko type of
[02:16:01.880 --> 02:16:06.760]  perverted behavior he got off on I think a hundred thousand dollars bail with
[02:16:06.760 --> 02:16:12.040]  with no he didn't even have to back it up with any kind of assets so an
[02:16:12.040 --> 02:16:17.520]  unsecured bail whereas James Stewart the milkman gets a million dollars in bail
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:22.200]  which is more than you even see for murderers and rapists so it's very clear
[02:16:22.200 --> 02:16:26.560]  that California is really selectively persecuting this individual for their
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:30.760]  own political reasons which we could probably get into on a later show yeah
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:39.160]  absolutely so give us your take on these Obama initiatives that have been
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:46.320]  coming down the pipeline so rapidly of late and what they spell for America well
[02:16:46.320 --> 02:16:51.720]  I'm gonna help help our listeners here parse this information the the executive
[02:16:51.720 --> 02:16:55.160]  orders called the National Defense Resources preparedness order it was
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:59.400]  issued on March 16th I apologize of Watson and Alex Jones have covered it
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:03.880]  especially on the show yesterday but there's more to it we post a story on
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:08.920]  this on natural news last night it's it's gone very viral 10,000 shares on that
[02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:13.200]  just this morning but some people were asking well wait a minute the federal
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:16.840]  government hasn't seized all the farms and all the food and all the fertilizers
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:22.760]  no they have seized control they have asserted authority and control over all
[02:17:22.760 --> 02:17:27.560]  of these resources the actual physical seizure will come at a later date but
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:31.760]  this executive order does assert control and I want to explain how that works by
[02:17:31.760 --> 02:17:36.080]  parsing the language of this executive order so that everybody understands it
[02:17:36.080 --> 02:17:42.680]  if you look at section 201 under part two priorities and allocations this word
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:47.840]  allocations is crucial to understand because it says that this this order is
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:52.680]  designed to quote allocate materials services and facilities as deemed
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:57.880]  necessary or appropriate to promote the National Defense and that could mean
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:02.320]  anything but if you look at the word allocation how do you allocate something
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:07.680]  if you don't have it so in order for the government to allocate something it must
[02:18:07.680 --> 02:18:12.160]  first confiscate it John and that brings me to my first slide right here
[02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:17.640]  allocation is confiscation can you see that for those of you watching on
[02:18:17.640 --> 02:18:23.640]  prisonplan.tv allocation is confiscation so wherever in this order that you
[02:18:23.640 --> 02:18:28.040]  read the word allocation you must first assume confiscation takes place and
[02:18:28.040 --> 02:18:33.000]  then once the government has those resources food tractors livestock
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:38.320]  energy water labor metals you name it then they reallocate it based on their
[02:18:38.320 --> 02:18:43.000]  priorities and we'll talk about their priorities as we continue this John.
[02:18:43.000 --> 02:18:47.720]  Well that's that's an important point you're making very important Mike as
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:51.640]  you're saying how are you going to allocate something unless it's already
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:56.240]  under your control which essentially means you own it because you can do
[02:18:56.240 --> 02:19:00.600]  whatever you want with it so this idea you know they like to use this word
[02:19:00.600 --> 02:19:06.280]  allocation it's sort of a gives you the sense of oh we know what we're doing and
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:09.640]  we're planning and we're putting some over here and putting some over there
[02:19:09.640 --> 02:19:14.800]  all in the best interest of course of you the people that's all we have in mind
[02:19:14.800 --> 02:19:19.800]  right yeah so essentially planned economy I mean that's that's what it
[02:19:19.800 --> 02:19:24.920]  comes down to it's it's it is really a communist style takeover of all private
[02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:29.960]  property across America and when they get into to food specifically in this
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:35.240]  executive order then they named food farms fertilizer livestock tractors all
[02:19:35.240 --> 02:19:39.600]  of this food production equipment and then in another section they define what
[02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:43.840]  is what is a food resource and here it is quote right from the White House dot
[02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:49.720]  gov document food food resources means all commodities and products or
[02:19:49.720 --> 02:19:53.640]  compliments such commodities or products that are capable of being ingested by
[02:19:53.640 --> 02:19:58.000]  either human beings or animals that's my cold that thought we got to go to a
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:01.520]  break here this is John math report sitting in for Alex Jones I'd seen the
[02:20:01.520 --> 02:20:05.120]  ungevity products work for many others and so I bought a bunch of them started
[02:20:05.120 --> 02:20:09.120]  using them had a little bit of results but I wasn't following the regimen every
[02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:14.400]  day but Aaron Dykes in my office did and lost more than 60 pounds when I saw
[02:20:14.400 --> 02:20:18.320]  those results I said I better follow my own advice I started taking the
[02:20:18.320 --> 02:20:23.720]  ungevity products and it's been incredible 37 pounds in two months our

[02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:15.560]  we're rounding the far term we're coming into the last half hour plus here
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:19.960]  with mike Adams the health ranger and mike you were talking about
[02:24:19.960 --> 02:24:25.400]  being able to understand the language in these executive orders and you know
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:29.800]  pronouncements from the white house and how this is shaping what really is
[02:24:29.800 --> 02:24:33.400]  happening in america so please continue this is fascinating
[02:24:33.400 --> 02:24:36.120]  yeah we're going through the language and the definitions so that everybody
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:40.920]  really understands just what a big power grab this is this executive order that
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:45.320]  was issued by president obama just a few days ago we covered the food resources
[02:24:45.320 --> 02:24:48.680]  definition before the break there there's one more sentence that's
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:52.040]  important there because in this order it states and again this is posted on
[02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:55.960]  whitehouse.gov this isn't some made-up thing this is right there out in out in
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:24:58.760]  the open as alex said it's hidden in plain view
[02:24:58.760 --> 02:25:02.520]  the words say quote food resources also means
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:06.200]  potable water packaged in commercially marketable containers
[02:25:06.200 --> 02:25:11.480]  all starches sugars vegetable and animal or marine fats and oils
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:18.120]  seeds cotton hemp and flax fiber uh so this
[02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:23.480]  wow federal government okay we lost mike there for a second
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:27.960]  he was about to say the incredible extent here i think he mentioned even
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:32.760]  hemp of control by the government over all of these
[02:25:32.760 --> 02:25:37.080]  resources when they say food they mean anything
[02:25:37.080 --> 02:25:41.400]  that you could possibly ingest or could be considered a food
[02:25:41.400 --> 02:25:48.440]  or supports food industry allocation becomes absolute control and that's
[02:25:48.440 --> 02:25:52.200]  what's happening here we're going to try to uh bring mike back but
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:55.640]  we're going to continue in the meantime
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:26:02.040]  oh mike you back yeah i am back uh uh is a little glitchy today uh continuing
[02:26:02.040 --> 02:26:06.600]  with energy this executive order also claims total control over all forms of
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:11.000]  energy in the country including solid fuels petroleum
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:17.080]  gas coal solar and wind so everybody out there who has a solar system
[02:26:17.080 --> 02:26:21.240]  you think you own it no you don't the federal government owns it obama just
[02:26:21.240 --> 02:26:25.560]  sees control or asserted control over your solar system
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:28.600]  meaning the federal government could come take it at any time
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:33.480]  if they deem it's necessary for any kind of a national emergency or national
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:36.200]  defense and again that could that could be from
[02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:39.640]  anything it could be something they make up they could post something on a
[02:26:39.640 --> 02:26:43.400]  message board somewhere and say a terrorist has threatened to
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:47.640]  for example blow up a train station they could use that as the trigger to say
[02:26:47.640 --> 02:26:50.680]  let's confiscate all power there goes your solar system
[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:57.160]  it's not an exaggeration yeah alex and uh paul watson pointed out a very good
[02:26:57.160 --> 02:27:02.120]  distinction too in this latest executive order of obamas which is
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:06.600]  there's no difference really between war emergency and peacetime
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:11.320]  that this you know allocation this control the seizing of everything
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:15.880]  could take place in either case we don't have to be at war
[02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:20.280]  it doesn't really matter it's as you say it could be an incident provoked by the
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:24.600]  powers that be it could be you know a whim it could be
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:26.920]  anything it's just like obama saying well i'm not
[02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:29.640]  going to kill anybody but i have a right to order
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:34.040]  anybody who was an american citizen be killed but of course i wouldn't do it
[02:27:34.040 --> 02:27:37.640]  and then you say well why did you pass the law the first place you know well
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:42.920]  we had to or something but it's the law once it's it's an order or it's the law
[02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:45.640]  there are people that are going to stand up and salute this and that's the
[02:27:45.640 --> 02:27:49.080]  important thing let's get to uh stockpiling here's
[02:27:49.080 --> 02:27:53.400]  another slide stockpiling when the government stockpiling that's
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:56.840]  good when people are stockpiling that's bad
[02:27:56.840 --> 02:28:01.720]  so there's a there's a another selective system of logic for stockpiling and in
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:05.800]  this executive order it says specifically section 202a
[02:28:05.800 --> 02:28:10.840]  it says that the secretary of defense oversees the military use of civil
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:15.640]  civil transportation stockpiles managed by the department of defense and
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:18.600]  directly related activities and then it goes in to talk about
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:21.400]  materials acquired under this executive order
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:24.840]  if in the judgment of the secretary of defense
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:29.080]  isn't that the man who just said the un runs our nation
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:33.880]  as the national defense stockpile manager so do you understand this the
[02:28:33.880 --> 02:28:36.440]  resources across the country are being grabbed
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:40.440]  and then controlled by a man who says congress is essentially null and void
[02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:43.640]  and the un makes the decisions for us so
[02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:47.400]  how does that serve america's interests you tell me
[02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:52.200]  panetta recently of course said that there was no way that war was going to
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:55.320]  be declared aggressively by the united states without
[02:28:55.320 --> 02:29:02.360]  un approval which raised about 20 eyebrows in washington
[02:29:02.360 --> 02:29:05.480]  and millions of eyebrows around the country
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:11.560]  absolutely incredible and also here what we're talking about is
[02:29:11.560 --> 02:29:18.200]  suggesting at this time at this crucial time during a presidential campaign
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:23.000]  during an economic deep deep deep recession
[02:29:23.000 --> 02:29:30.120]  that we're going to call this war time emergency time control time from above
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:33.560]  we're coming down to another break here this is john raffport mike adams who
[02:29:33.560 --> 02:29:37.080]  has a lot more for us on the language of the obama
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:41.480]  resolutions and pronouncements sitting in here for alex jones say on the alex
[02:29:41.480 --> 02:29:44.840]  jones show we'll be right back
[02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:58.840]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:01.320 --> 02:30:06.280]  folks i ran in the mid-east nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices
[02:30:06.280 --> 02:30:10.440]  whether you're struggling with food costs which are being blown up by gas costs
[02:30:10.440 --> 02:30:13.960]  now or know that when the mid-east showdown explodes

[02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:15.480]  john math report sitting in for alex jones on the alex jones show with mike
[02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:20.360]  adams the health ranger and mike uh continue to explore
[02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:27.880]  the language that's hidden in these obama declarations about natural resources
[02:33:27.880 --> 02:33:31.640]  sure well one of the most often used strategies
[02:33:31.640 --> 02:33:38.040]  of tyrants is to pass laws and regulations that are sufficiently
[02:33:38.040 --> 02:33:41.960]  vague to allow them to interpret it in any way they want
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:45.640]  down the road and then they can claim well that's the law just like hitler
[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:48.840]  said well it's it's that's the law you know we're gonna we're gonna
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:52.520]  kill all all these jewish prisoners and we're gonna invade these countries
[02:33:52.520 --> 02:33:55.800]  and that's the law well as alex often mentions just because it's the law
[02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:58.040]  doesn't make it right it doesn't make it just
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:34:02.040]  it doesn't make it moral or or ethical so we have all these violations of law
[02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:06.920]  going on and they're all being quote uh made official by words on a piece of
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:10.440]  paper that really don't mean anything and one of the key concepts in this
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:15.160]  executive order is is this one the continuity of government
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:19.240]  but never the continuity of liberty now think about this
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:23.240]  if you look at the language of this act this order
[02:34:23.240 --> 02:34:26.920]  everything about it and and most of what the federal government talks about
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:30.360]  today is protecting the continuity of government
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:33.400]  protecting government with stockpiles of weapons
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:37.160]  ammo communications food water medical gear in caves
[02:34:37.160 --> 02:34:40.360]  you know all across the country well at least in certain strategic areas i
[02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:42.600]  should say but there's never talk about the
[02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:46.680]  continuity of liberty there's never talk about how do we protect
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:50.680]  the people there's never talk about maybe the people should stockpile
[02:34:50.680 --> 02:34:55.480]  something in fact it's the opposite john they say that when people stockpile
[02:34:55.480 --> 02:34:59.720]  supplies they might be terrorists so wait a minute
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:04.520]  this is going to be fantastic mike that you you brought this up
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:08.840]  this distinction between different views of stockpile
[02:35:08.840 --> 02:35:13.400]  you know i mean because i'm a reporter i can suddenly whisk back through hundreds
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:17.800]  of stories that i've read in my life so-and-so was arrested and accused of
[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:21.400]  stockpiling right right stockpiling this or that
[02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:24.920]  well we got to watch out for this guy he's stockpiling food
[02:35:24.920 --> 02:35:29.320]  can you believe it in a seller he's got like six months worth of food
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:35.160]  oh my god but on the other hand the government is stockpiling
[02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:40.840]  weapons as stockpiling reserves of oil as stock whatever the government stockpiles
[02:35:40.840 --> 02:35:45.240]  we automatically salute it right and remember the alerts issued by the fbi a
[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:49.560]  couple of weeks ago which was was covered on info wars quite extensively
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:53.880]  that they said anybody who goes to a military surplus store
[02:35:53.880 --> 02:35:57.880]  and buys m re's which and then stockpiles
[02:35:57.880 --> 02:36:01.240]  the that food might be a terrorist it's almost like a
[02:36:01.240 --> 02:36:05.640]  jeff foxworthy joke if you do this you might be a redneck it's like yeah if
[02:36:05.640 --> 02:36:09.160]  you have a tattoo you you might be a terrorist if you buy food you might be
[02:36:09.160 --> 02:36:12.440]  a terror in other words if you do what the government does
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:16.520]  you might be a terrorist but they're not so i mean think about the government
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:20.920]  they're stockpiling weapons ammo communications gear medical supplies
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:24.680]  resources all kinds of things i mean underground bunkers underground cities
[02:36:24.680 --> 02:36:29.000]  in fact but if you have more than three days worth of food in your
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:33.640]  pantry your suspect give me a break
[02:36:33.640 --> 02:36:36.840]  this is part of the same crackdown i believe
[02:36:36.840 --> 02:36:40.440]  that happened to james steward and rossom
[02:36:40.440 --> 02:36:44.680]  they look around and they they're looking really if you
[02:36:44.680 --> 02:36:49.960]  boil it down for independence you know you can call it whatever you want to
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:53.720]  this guy's thinking for himself he's got you know three weeks worth of food in
[02:36:53.720 --> 02:36:57.560]  his house uh-oh this guy's selling raw milk
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:01.480]  he's out of control he's out of our control uh-oh
[02:37:01.480 --> 02:37:05.560]  he's thinking for himself we got a stomp on this guy's head
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:10.200]  this is almost like saying to me
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:13.960]  you know the free market is a joke that's what they're saying
[02:37:13.960 --> 02:37:18.040]  it's a complete joke we're not going to stand for the free market
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:22.440]  this guy has a club in it in la and he's got people that are willing to pick up
[02:37:22.440 --> 02:37:26.440]  milk from a farm and they're part of the club we're not going to allow that to
[02:37:26.440 --> 02:37:29.640]  happen this is too free market we want top
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:33.320]  down control every bottle of milk has to be pasteurized
[02:37:33.320 --> 02:37:36.680]  that's true the the government wants to create victimization
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:40.280]  they want people to be helpless and dependent because that gives government
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:44.280]  the justification for existence and i've got one more
[02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:47.400]  paragraph to mention from this executive order but i want to
[02:37:47.400 --> 02:37:50.680]  also say john i hope you and i can get into some positive solutions
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:54.200]  we always talk about the problems and i know we've also got great ideas on
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:57.400]  solutions so let's let's think about what we can give listeners today
[02:37:57.400 --> 02:38:01.240]  on how they can stand up against this and take back their freedom and take back
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:03.960]  their liberty and take back their their sovereignty as
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:06.920]  individual citizens of this great nation but here's
[02:38:06.920 --> 02:38:12.040]  here's a section i want to read and also uh well this is section 804c
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:15.240]  this is the last paragraph of the executive order right before obama's
[02:38:15.240 --> 02:38:19.160]  name signing the order it says listen to this
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:25.800]  this order is not intended to and does not create any right or benefit
[02:38:25.800 --> 02:38:30.760]  uh enforceable at law blah blah blah blah to
[02:38:30.760 --> 02:38:35.640]  essentially to agents or employees or any other person in other words is
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:38.520]  saying that even though we the government are confiscating
[02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:42.280]  everything across the country it does not give you the people any
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:47.480]  right or any benefit to any of those resources that have been confiscated
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:51.400]  so it's once again very clever lawyer language
[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:54.440]  sufficiently vague but if you read between the lines what it really means
[02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:57.880]  is we the government can come take from you your food your seeds your
[02:38:57.880 --> 02:39:03.160]  solar panels your cattle your tractors and you don't have any right
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:07.240]  or any control over any of it that's exactly what this executive order
[02:39:07.240 --> 02:39:09.960]  states and it can be initiated or triggered
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:14.200]  by any statement it could be a press conference at the white house
[02:39:14.200 --> 02:39:18.040]  we're now in a state of emergency and we can't tell you why because that's a
[02:39:18.040 --> 02:39:22.680]  national security secret but we are trust us we're the government you see
[02:39:22.680 --> 02:39:27.240]  how that works john yeah do i see how it works i mean
[02:39:27.240 --> 02:39:31.880]  i've known people that have had their computers confiscated
[02:39:31.880 --> 02:39:37.400]  by the cops or da's and trying to get those suckers back
[02:39:37.400 --> 02:39:40.920]  a week a month a year sometimes they never all we don't know where it is it's
[02:39:40.920 --> 02:39:44.600]  lost in the system so can you imagine this idea when you say
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:48.360]  confiscation they mean confiscation in other words
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:51.960]  you guys are back there i don't know it seemed like four or five years ago you
[02:39:51.960 --> 02:39:55.320]  took all my farm equipment you remember that when we had that
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:39:59.800]  storm you know oh yeah i seem to remember that well i'd like it back if you
[02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:04.360]  don't mind gee we don't know where that is we think it might be in
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:09.720]  argentina now you know yeah exactly i actually have an interview on on the
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:14.840]  record with a central texas farmer who said on camera on the record that fema
[02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:19.000]  was calling the farms this was following a hurricane katrina
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:22.840]  fema was calling all the farms and inventorying all their crops all their
[02:40:22.840 --> 02:40:25.560]  seeds and all their equipment asking what they had
[02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:29.160]  and he told me that the farmers complied and they gave them the list
[02:40:29.160 --> 02:40:32.440]  and i said well wait a minute don't you realize fema is building a database of
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:35.800]  all the food you have even food in the ground that hasn't even been harvested
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:39.000]  yet why do you think they would want such a database
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:42.360]  and the answer is well yeah i guess because they want to take it
[02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:45.800]  they want to redistribute it john see they want to reallocate it
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:49.000]  so they want to take what's yours and give it to their
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:53.640]  their people and call it you know national defense
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:41:01.320]  speaking of solutions the issue of freedom is to me the key
[02:41:01.320 --> 02:41:04.760]  in other words if anything is surviving this country
[02:41:04.760 --> 02:41:10.120]  from where it originally was framed in its founding documents
[02:41:10.120 --> 02:41:14.920]  it is that idea of freedom and i know certainly in the medical area
[02:41:14.920 --> 02:41:18.440]  and i believe it's also true politically
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:22.520]  that when you bring up and you force the issue to be the issue of freedom no
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:26.200]  matter what the government wants to twist it into
[02:41:26.200 --> 02:41:30.120]  you have a chance you have a fighting chance for example
[02:41:30.120 --> 02:41:34.280]  the government says that somebody is forced to take certain medications
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:38.040]  you say wait a minute are you saying that i have no freedom
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:42.840]  to decide whether a medicine goes in my body you have a chance
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:49.240]  of fighting that way you have a chance and that's why freedom is so vital to
[02:41:49.240 --> 02:41:55.240]  be the central issue here i think it's crucial john that the listeners today
[02:41:55.240 --> 02:42:00.360]  assert their constitutional rights their god-given rights their natural law
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:04.280]  rights to to have ownership of private property
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:07.320]  to have ownership and control over their own bodies
[02:42:07.320 --> 02:42:12.280]  to have the fundamental god-given right to choose what kind of food you want to
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:15.080]  consume what kind of medicine you wish to consume
[02:42:15.080 --> 02:42:18.760]  and even as parents to have the right to control
[02:42:18.760 --> 02:42:22.600]  the decisions of what your children drink what your children
[02:42:22.600 --> 02:42:26.920]  get in terms of medicine what they eat at school in terms of a brown bag lunch
[02:42:26.920 --> 02:42:29.800]  and if you think about it all of these things are under attack
[02:42:29.800 --> 02:42:33.320]  every one of them we saw the home gardener under attack
[02:42:33.320 --> 02:42:38.280]  in michigan that was julie bass we've seen the the brown bag lunches made by
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:40.920]  the parents under attack at schools now where they
[02:42:40.920 --> 02:42:44.440]  have food police that make the kids eat
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:47.720]  chicken nuggets manufactured out of pink slime
[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:51.240]  instead of the the food brought from home made by their parents
[02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:55.320]  we've seen farmers under assault the amish farmers vernon herrschberger
[02:42:55.320 --> 02:42:59.240]  hauled into court for his raw milk every one of these is under attack including
[02:42:59.240 --> 02:43:02.520]  the right to own private property as we've seen in this executive order
[02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:05.480]  so i'm curious about your thoughts on this john but i would say
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:09.960]  the answer is it always is restore the constitution
[02:43:09.960 --> 02:43:13.480]  restore the bill of rights it's always the right answer
[02:43:13.480 --> 02:43:18.360]  ron paul ron paul ron paul it's always the right answer
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:22.040]  yeah restoring the constitution to me is always the right answer
[02:43:22.040 --> 02:43:26.200]  and part of that solution by the way and there are groups around you can find
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:32.680]  in an explorer restore power to smaller units of government
[02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:36.760]  like the states as opposed to the federal government the counties as opposed
[02:43:36.760 --> 02:43:41.320]  to the states the cities as opposed to the counties and so on down the line
[02:43:41.320 --> 02:43:44.280]  you can see in the tenth and eleventh amendments to the constitution
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:48.520]  where that is explicitly stated in the reserve clause and other clause
[02:43:48.520 --> 02:43:52.760]  that has to do with freedom uh being really
[02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:57.080]  given back to the states now people will argue about this and say well the states
[02:43:57.080 --> 02:43:59.320]  are corrupt and they're horrible and they always have been
[02:43:59.320 --> 02:44:04.440]  and therefore we should have the federal government on top of the whole pile
[02:44:04.440 --> 02:44:08.840]  this is absolutely not the case at this point in time
[02:44:08.840 --> 02:44:13.080]  the states at least have a chance and i can tell you
[02:44:13.080 --> 02:44:16.680]  just briefly there are a number of states
[02:44:16.680 --> 02:44:21.880]  that could put into effect free market practices
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:26.200]  if they were free from federal control that would make their states economic
[02:44:26.200 --> 02:44:31.560]  bonanzas i won't get into details here but it would work in a second
[02:44:31.560 --> 02:44:34.760]  like you're gonna say hey if a state just legalized
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:39.560]  hemp farming i'm talking industrial hemp there you go smokable medicinal pot
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:42.920]  i'm talking about industrial hemp that you can't even get high on
[02:44:42.920 --> 02:44:49.240]  if a if a state like uh even texas let's say if they legalize growing hemp do
[02:44:49.240 --> 02:44:53.480]  you realize the the economic abundance of the agricultural sector in texas
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:57.160]  texas would be a massive exporter of hemp all across the country
[02:44:57.160 --> 02:45:00.360]  hemp seeds hemp oils hemp fibers hemp textiles
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:03.880]  it would be like money raining out of the sky
[02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:07.640]  on texas farmers so why doesn't texas legalize hemp
[02:45:07.640 --> 02:45:11.240]  or or another state hemp grows in much of of the country
[02:45:11.240 --> 02:45:14.680]  it's a very abundant crop it's just one example there are thousands of these
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:17.640]  examples where we could restore economic prosperity
[02:45:17.640 --> 02:45:22.200]  and restore liberty at the same time absolutely mike and
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:25.400]  for example in the area of alternative medicine
[02:45:25.400 --> 02:45:28.760]  there are places where it's much harder to practice than others around the
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:32.200]  country well if a state like california for example
[02:45:32.200 --> 02:45:37.080]  decided look we're really gonna open the door not just partway but all the way
[02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:42.200]  to alternative practitioners under the mandate of do no harm
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:46.440]  which can be easily framed into a law it's been done other in other states
[02:45:46.440 --> 02:45:49.720]  right and now all of a sudden california becomes
[02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:54.360]  the premier place for people who want to buy their own responsibility
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:58.200]  to show up and get alternative medical treatments alternative health treatments
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:01.960]  are you kidding the economy of california would
[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:07.480]  boom out the top in six months and then the idea of these states giving back
[02:46:07.480 --> 02:46:11.720]  their rights to the federal government would never happen texas
[02:46:11.720 --> 02:46:15.320]  there's others we can't grow hemp anymore are you kidding
[02:46:15.320 --> 02:46:19.000]  never this is the thing these solutions are right at our fingertips they're
[02:46:19.000 --> 02:46:22.360]  readily available all these people in washington parade around like they're
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:25.480]  trying to figure out how to solve the economy you know people at the federal
[02:46:25.480 --> 02:46:29.000]  reserve and the banks how do we solve the economy
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:32.680]  legalize freedom that's how you solve the economic problem
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:37.000]  legalize it you know jonathan emor wrote a book restore the republic
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:40.120]  that's a good read it's the intro was written by ron paul it's a very
[02:46:40.120 --> 02:46:44.840]  important piece you know legalize freedom and abundance naturally
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:48.120]  follows but that's exactly why that they're crushing liberty
[02:46:48.120 --> 02:46:52.200]  because they don't want people to be free and to be abundant and to be
[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:54.840]  innovative on their own they're trying to crush the economy
[02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:58.840]  and crush freedom at the same time and folks if we don't wake up and turn this
[02:46:58.840 --> 02:47:02.600]  turn this thing around i mean we we could very easily be crossing a
[02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:06.520]  tipping point very soon where it's too late so wake the heck up
[02:47:06.520 --> 02:47:12.040]  restore liberty now or you may lose it for generations
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:15.960]  and going along with that mic is decentralized
[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:22.040]  that's the way to restore liberty in many areas in many fronts
[02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:26.440]  decentralized the power who's got the power now well the federal government
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:29.320]  does the federal government if they don't have
[02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:32.680]  the overt power they have the power the purse strings because they can come into
[02:47:32.680 --> 02:47:36.280]  a school system or any industry and they can say hey we're
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:39.720]  dangling some money for you here but if you want the money you've got to do
[02:47:39.720 --> 02:47:44.440]  this no thanks we don't want it no thank you we don't need it
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:47.800]  we're going to take back our own power at the state level the county level the
[02:47:47.800 --> 02:47:52.200]  city the town the village the individual level you know there's an
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:55.480]  interesting trend the metaphor for this which i'm
[02:47:55.480 --> 02:47:58.120]  sure you'll appreciate john is that in a human body
[02:47:58.120 --> 02:48:01.960]  when powers decentralized and every cell plays its proper role
[02:48:01.960 --> 02:48:05.720]  you have a healthy functioning holistic system when you have a group of cells
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:09.240]  that tries to take over power and take over control you know what that's called
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:12.200]  a cancer tumor what is big government today
[02:48:12.200 --> 02:48:15.800]  an economic cancer tumor it's the same the metaphor
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:19.560]  applies we have a cancer in our nation it is called
[02:48:19.560 --> 02:48:24.200]  centralized command economy control and these executive orders that we just
[02:48:24.200 --> 02:48:30.200]  talked about further that cancer we must reverse this cancer and save the
[02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:35.000]  patient which is our republic we can only do that through holistic
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:40.440]  decentralization of power support of the the immune system of the nation which
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:44.120]  is the people the people speaking out and saying we
[02:48:44.120 --> 02:48:47.320]  demand our rights as guaranteed under the bill of rights
[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:51.080]  to restore the republic restore our liberty restore our economic abundance
[02:48:51.080 --> 02:48:54.680]  i mean it's all right there in front of us john it's not a mystery
[02:48:54.680 --> 02:48:58.200]  it's a blueprint for liberty it's right there in front of us if we just grab it
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:01.800]  you know what i mean you bet mike you bet i do
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:05.640]  absolutely right when alex and i were talking the other day
[02:49:05.640 --> 02:49:09.400]  in an interview that we did at info wars here
[02:49:09.400 --> 02:49:13.480]  we got to the point where it was you know these guys
[02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:17.400]  these guys who think of themselves and see themselves as masters and controllers
[02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:20.520]  these elites they're really committing suicide
[02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:24.200]  this is really what they're doing i mean underneath at all that's where they're
[02:49:24.200 --> 02:49:27.320]  going the only problem is is that they're
[02:49:27.320 --> 02:49:31.640]  tending to drag everybody else along with them and it's just the analogy that
[02:49:31.640 --> 02:49:36.040]  you gave of cancer that's how they're committing suicide
[02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:39.160]  they're going out there to the point where they're restricting
[02:49:39.160 --> 02:49:43.000]  other people's freedom so much that they're destroying themselves in the
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:46.280]  process because that's what happens when you try to restrict
[02:49:46.280 --> 02:49:50.440]  other people's freedoms beyond a certain point that's what's going on
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:53.880]  and they are saying that you're right they're suicidal
[02:49:53.880 --> 02:49:57.080]  they're insane alex talks about it all the time the global elite
[02:49:57.080 --> 02:50:01.640]  have pushed too far they're so insane i mean they're so
[02:50:01.640 --> 02:50:06.760]  they're sociopathic insane demons almost from another dimension or something i
[02:50:06.760 --> 02:50:09.720]  say that jokingly but i mean they are insane
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:12.760]  they're so insane that they're gonna destroy us at the same time they destroy
[02:50:12.760 --> 02:50:16.120]  themselves and they don't care their quest for power will lead to their own
[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:19.400]  destruction and they can't see that happening because they're
[02:50:19.400 --> 02:50:23.400]  they're just completely infected with insanity that's why those of us who are
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:26.920]  sane who are rational who can put the pieces of the puzzles together who
[02:50:26.920 --> 02:50:29.880]  can connect the dots who can see what's about to happen
[02:50:29.880 --> 02:50:35.400]  we must rise up peacefully and and with knowledge and with wisdom and say enough
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:38.360]  is enough let's turn this thing around let's get to some solutions let's
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:42.360]  legalize freedom in this country go ahead john
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:46.520]  okay we're gonna take a break here and then come back for the last segment

[02:50:57.480 --> 02:51:03.880]  in this global insanity a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of
[02:51:03.880 --> 02:51:06.760]  research into why even if i had a pretty good size
[02:51:06.760 --> 02:51:10.840]  meal that i was still starving and my research led me to a well known fact
[02:51:10.840 --> 02:51:14.600]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and
[02:51:14.600 --> 02:51:18.120]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted
[02:51:18.120 --> 02:51:21.640]  of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements
[02:51:21.640 --> 02:51:25.240]  that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer

[02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:23.320]  i think i'll be interesting to mention a little bit about celebrities you know
[02:54:23.320 --> 02:54:26.920]  back in the health freedom days of the early 90s
[02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:30.200]  there were a lot of celebrities like james earl jones mel Gibson mariel
[02:54:30.200 --> 02:54:33.160]  hemmingway lindsay wagner who came out in favor
[02:54:33.160 --> 02:54:36.440]  of the freedom of the people to have their choice in whatever food they really
[02:54:36.440 --> 02:54:40.360]  wanted to eat or milk to drink or supplements to take
[02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:46.440]  and now all of a sudden we don't see celebrities showing up in public
[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:51.080]  speaking on behalf of freedom as you're talking about
[02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:54.840]  a whole change has occurred in a matter of a little over
[02:54:54.840 --> 02:54:59.640]  uh... you know 15 20 years here it's very strange to me
[02:54:59.640 --> 02:55:03.320]  there's so much pressure now political pressure in hollywood that these
[02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:07.480]  these celebrities have learned that when they speak out they get punished
[02:55:07.480 --> 02:55:11.880]  financially they lose roles in movies that their careers go down the tubes and
[02:55:11.880 --> 02:55:15.880]  it's it's only celebrities who have a lifetime of success that aren't afraid
[02:55:15.880 --> 02:55:18.520]  to speak out who are who are actually doing so for example
[02:55:18.520 --> 02:55:22.680]  susanne summers to her credit has put out a book challenging the cancer
[02:55:22.680 --> 02:55:25.880]  industry she interviewed complimentary and alternative cancer doctors all
[02:55:25.880 --> 02:55:29.400]  across the country i don't recall the title of that book at the moment but you
[02:55:29.400 --> 02:55:32.200]  can search susanne summers anywhere and find the book
[02:55:32.200 --> 02:55:35.880]  and that was a really amazing wonderful investigative work
[02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:39.800]  and of course she was attacked for doing that there are others who are attacked
[02:55:39.800 --> 02:55:43.160]  for speaking out and you're right john it's a shame
[02:55:43.160 --> 02:55:48.120]  that the political environment today favors those who stay silent because
[02:55:48.120 --> 02:55:50.600]  that's exactly the opposite of what we need
[02:55:50.600 --> 02:55:53.960]  we must speak out and for those listening today too it's
[02:55:53.960 --> 02:55:57.720]  you know this isn't the freedom is not a spectator sport you've got to take
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:02.120]  action or we will lose this republic very very quickly
[02:56:02.120 --> 02:56:05.560]  decentralizing freedom it has a precedent
[02:56:05.560 --> 02:56:08.920]  it has a program it's a thing that can be done
[02:56:08.920 --> 02:56:14.120]  to try to bring more power down locally you see from this top heavy
[02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:17.960]  gigantic colossus all the way to the individual
[02:56:17.960 --> 02:56:20.760]  and there are steps and there are organizations and there are things that
[02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:24.600]  you can explore here this is not just we're not just talking
[02:56:24.600 --> 02:56:28.760]  hot air here folks mike put his finger on it legislate
[02:56:28.760 --> 02:56:33.960]  freedom doing that changes everything and then more people begin to show up
[02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:37.800]  all of a sudden they say oh yeah freedom i forgot that you know
[02:56:37.800 --> 02:56:41.320]  i've been reading the newspapers for the last 15 years
[02:56:41.320 --> 02:56:45.000]  and come to think of it i've never seen the word individual with the word
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:48.200]  freedom next to it isn't that amazing you know
[02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:52.280]  where did that go yeah well we're bringing it back folks
[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:55.880]  we're bringing it back when you think about the role that the government is
[02:56:55.880 --> 02:57:00.680]  trying to take now it's the role of saving you from yourself which was
[02:57:00.680 --> 02:57:03.960]  brilliantly illustrated in in the south park episode of the
[02:57:03.960 --> 02:57:07.480]  the tsa the toilet safety administration brilliant
[02:57:07.480 --> 02:57:10.920]  because this one woman fell in the toilet now everybody has to have toilet
[02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:13.400]  seatbelts well we've got to stop thinking of the
[02:57:13.400 --> 02:57:17.320]  government as our savior we've got to start thinking about the government as
[02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:21.880]  only one role of being important protecting our liberties and our rights
[02:57:21.880 --> 02:57:26.280]  life is dangerous driving a car is dangerous downhill skiing is dangerous
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:29.320]  we've got to stop thinking the government can save us from every little thing
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:31.800]  and start taking responsibility for our own lives
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:35.320]  and dealing with a little bit of danger hey i drove through some water
[02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:39.000]  today three feet of water flooding across my driveway to get here was that
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:43.720]  dangerous yeah so what i'm here anyway but i'm happy
[02:57:43.720 --> 02:57:46.840]  to be here i'm happy to be part of this this liberty effort thanks for having

[02:57:55.880 --> 02:57:59.720]  we've talked about a lot of issues here political medical maybe a little bit
[02:57:59.720 --> 02:58:03.480]  more medical than you used to hearing i thought it was important to get it out
[02:58:03.480 --> 02:58:07.720]  because it does impact on your freedom that's the bottom line here
[02:58:07.720 --> 02:58:12.920]  that's the power that can't be destroyed mike
[02:58:12.920 --> 02:58:17.880]  adams thanks so much john rapaport sitting in for alex jones
