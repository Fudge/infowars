[00:00.000 --> 00:13.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.480 --> 00:21.920]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex
[00:21.920 --> 00:31.240]  jones welcome to the alex jones show on this monday february 16th 2015 i'm
[00:31.240 --> 00:34.640]  david night i'll be your host today alex jones will be joining us in the
[00:34.640 --> 00:39.920]  second hour also talk show host on another talk show host on a GCN program
[00:39.920 --> 00:44.600]  the power hour joce riley will also be joining us in the second hour now of course
[00:44.600 --> 00:49.400]  joce riley is a registered nurse a whistleblower she's been a talk show
[00:49.400 --> 00:53.960]  host speaking out for individual liberty for quite some time on GCN she's
[00:53.960 --> 00:57.760]  going to be talking about her personal struggle with cancer and that'll be in
[00:57.760 --> 01:01.920]  the second hour and as i said alex jones will be joining us at that time as
[01:01.920 --> 01:08.960]  well today i want to focus on what i believe is an attack on the very
[01:08.960 --> 01:13.920]  foundations of our individual rights of our legal system in a way that is
[01:13.920 --> 01:17.080]  unprecedented of course it's an incremental story we've seen this
[01:17.080 --> 01:21.680]  happening for a long time but it's really coming to a head in a major way
[01:21.680 --> 01:26.720]  and we're seeing a lot of support from the media from a lot of individuals we
[01:26.720 --> 01:31.320]  had the story this last friday from kit daniels about the canadian mother who
[01:31.320 --> 01:37.880]  was who wrote this angry uninformed straw man attack on people who don't give
[01:37.880 --> 01:42.120]  their informed consent to the pharmaceutical companies and the
[01:42.120 --> 01:46.480]  government they're demanding that we do that without thinking they were demanding
[01:46.480 --> 01:51.320]  the demanding the same kind of blind obedience to the government and to the
[01:51.320 --> 01:55.080]  pharmaceutical companies that they have they don't want us to take a look at
[01:55.080 --> 01:58.760]  what's there and so we're going to look at that as well as the attitudes that
[01:58.760 --> 02:02.720]  we're seeing surfacing in california we've got the la times applauding
[02:02.720 --> 02:07.720]  governor jerry brown saying that he's showing new flexibility because he's
[02:07.720 --> 02:14.440]  considering mandatory vaccinations isn't that orwellian new speak or maybe
[02:14.440 --> 02:18.760]  it's news speak when he starts talking about how he's going they're going to
[02:18.760 --> 02:24.520]  take away people's personal belief exemptions do you understand how they
[02:24.520 --> 02:28.680]  twist the language to get what they want we see this all the time as the
[02:28.680 --> 02:32.320]  statist as the socialist try to move their agenda forward you take something
[02:32.320 --> 02:37.840]  that was informed consent the very basis of the nuremberg code to try to
[02:37.840 --> 02:41.360]  prevent what we saw happening in concentration camps of medical
[02:41.360 --> 02:45.320]  experimentation on individuals that we saw happening in nazi germany in
[02:45.320 --> 02:50.360]  japan where they did horrible things to people and said it's for the greater
[02:50.360 --> 02:54.480]  good of mankind because if I can experiment on these people over here I
[02:54.480 --> 02:59.120]  may learn something that will help millions of people down the road see
[02:59.120 --> 03:04.440]  that's the way they move this ahead they talk about the collective good and
[03:04.440 --> 03:08.480]  they have absolutely no regard for individual rights there was a pushback
[03:08.480 --> 03:13.040]  of course against that in the nuremberg code people called it what it was
[03:13.040 --> 03:19.640]  medical tyranny it's despicable and we have to not let them railroad us into
[03:19.640 --> 03:22.680]  that sir they're trying to drive us off the cliff in the same way that the
[03:22.680 --> 03:27.000]  disney film makers drove the lemmings off the cliff and so we're going to talk
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.600]  about that we're also going to talk about the keystone pipeline it's back
[03:29.600 --> 03:33.360]  in the news again because you know the republicans just keep voting on it they
[03:33.360 --> 03:38.200]  passed it now the tenth time and of course we have the republican senate
[03:38.200 --> 03:42.440]  passing that as well as the house has been passing it as long as many times
[03:42.440 --> 03:46.400]  as they need to doesn't look like it's going to get past obama but there are
[03:46.400 --> 03:50.800]  some very serious issues here that go beyond the environmental issues this
[03:50.800 --> 03:57.080]  goes to the essence of imminent domain and private property now of course we
[03:57.080 --> 04:01.600]  had the supreme court decision ten years ago kello versus new london
[04:01.600 --> 04:06.720]  essentially saying that one private organization could with the government
[04:06.720 --> 04:13.160]  come in and say because my private use of this is going to be for the public
[04:13.160 --> 04:18.400]  good more so than your private uses I'm going to be able to take that property
[04:18.400 --> 04:22.240]  and they supported that all the way the supreme court so what do we see now
[04:22.240 --> 04:27.040]  happening with the keystone pipeline now we have a foreign corporation a
[04:27.040 --> 04:30.480]  canadian corporation coming in and telling people in many cases who have
[04:30.480 --> 04:35.400]  had nebraska farms for over 100 years I'm sorry your private property rights are
[04:35.400 --> 04:40.280]  not important we're going to turn them over to a canadian corporation you
[04:40.280 --> 04:44.840]  understand how this is happening and of course we've got Cuomo's son talking
[04:44.840 --> 04:48.760]  about how our rights don't come from God so your individual rights don't come
[04:48.760 --> 04:52.400]  from God we don't need your consent either for government or for mandatory
[04:52.400 --> 04:58.000]  vaccines this is the way the country falls stay with us we'll be right back

[08:57.880 --> 09:03.320]  broken today it appears to be legitimate as far as I've seen I haven't seen any
[09:03.320 --> 09:08.320]  analysis that would suggest otherwise but a video purporting to show IS
[09:08.320 --> 09:13.640]  militants beheading 21 Egyptian hostages who were taken a few weeks ago
[09:13.640 --> 09:18.320]  they were all laborers and they were kidnapped by ISIS and they show a mass
[09:18.320 --> 09:22.480]  beheading and people are rightfully outraged especially if this is if this
[09:22.480 --> 09:29.040]  is true we need to understand however before we get goaded into a war that
[09:29.040 --> 09:34.840]  this organization was created funded trained by the American government by
[09:34.840 --> 09:39.800]  the CIA they were our proxies in Syria this is something that has been going
[09:39.800 --> 09:44.840]  on throughout the Middle East so things are not just as simple as they appear to
[09:44.840 --> 09:50.520]  be unfortunately and I think it's very important to go back and to look at the
[09:50.520 --> 09:55.560]  reaction of some of our Middle Eastern allies let's take the Turkish prime
[09:55.560 --> 10:01.200]  minister Erdogan now remember last week there was the shooting in Chapel Hill the
[10:01.200 --> 10:04.800]  question as to whether or not it was a hate crime directed against Muslims
[10:04.800 --> 10:10.120]  since all three of the victims were Muslims or was the guy just a liberal
[10:10.120 --> 10:16.280]  Rachel Maddow loving gun owning nut who shot these people of course because he
[10:16.280 --> 10:21.120]  had a gun the narrative out there was that he was some kind of a right-winger
[10:21.120 --> 10:29.000]  terrorist he was nothing of the sort this guy was a definitely as I lived near
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.240]  that area in North Carolina as most of the people in Chapel Hill and UNCR he
[10:33.240 --> 10:37.320]  was a card-carrying liberal if there ever was one but the bottom line is they
[10:37.320 --> 10:41.160]  pulled this back and if it couldn't be a right-wing terrorist then it just had
[10:41.160 --> 10:45.560]  to be a parking lot dispute or whatever the case was the prime minister of
[10:45.560 --> 10:52.320]  Turkey lectured Obama and said if you stay silent on this when faced with an
[10:52.320 --> 10:55.160]  incident like this and you don't make a statement the world will stay silent
[10:55.160 --> 11:01.080]  towards you and he says I asked Mr. Obama where are you Mr. President well I
[11:01.080 --> 11:06.720]  asked Mr. Erdogan where are you Mr. President have you spoken out against
[11:06.720 --> 11:10.400]  these 21 beheadings by ISIS I haven't heard anything from that it seems to be
[11:10.400 --> 11:14.760]  very selective clearly there's no question if that video is real what's
[11:14.760 --> 11:17.760]  going on there there is a significant question as to whether or not that was a
[11:17.760 --> 11:22.280]  hate crime if the guy shot three people and there seems to be no question about
[11:22.280 --> 11:27.960]  that isn't that enough of course that's the issue with hate crimes there's
[11:27.960 --> 11:33.480]  always some kind of alternative agenda that it's meant to serve some kind of a
[11:33.480 --> 11:38.960]  divide and conquer agenda it's enough if the guy shot three people to just get
[11:38.960 --> 11:43.200]  him for three counts of murder I don't see why the hate crime issue is even
[11:43.200 --> 11:47.280]  important there but if we're going to talk about doing something about these
[11:47.280 --> 11:50.920]  outrages that are being committed on film whether they're staged whether they're
[11:50.920 --> 11:55.280]  real everybody appears we've got a majority that wants to go to war wants
[11:55.280 --> 11:58.560]  to put troops on the ground we've got a two-thirds majority according to a
[11:58.560 --> 12:02.420]  recent poll in America that want to send troops on the ground to stop these
[12:02.420 --> 12:08.280]  videos that we see bear in mind that our closest ally in the Middle East
[12:08.280 --> 12:15.360]  Saudi Arabia and they are our closest ally is beheading one person every four
[12:15.360 --> 12:21.600]  days one person every four days so do the math what ISIS just did on video
[12:21.600 --> 12:29.320]  Saudi Arabia does in less than 90 days on average yet they are close allies why
[12:29.320 --> 12:35.920]  are they are close allies well because of oil because of course the CIA can use
[12:35.920 --> 12:41.920]  them our military industrial complex can use them to continually have war in the
[12:41.920 --> 12:46.800]  Middle East because that suits their purposes just imagine if we weren't such
[12:46.800 --> 12:51.640]  close allies with the Saudis probably some high-ranking government
[12:51.640 --> 12:56.600]  government officials would not have been able to sell oil futures short and
[12:56.600 --> 13:00.560]  make a fortune which I don't have any evidence that anybody has done but don't
[13:00.560 --> 13:04.800]  you think maybe there's some extra money and some of those black ops CIA funds
[13:04.800 --> 13:09.560]  don't you think that the Saudis who are joined at the hip with the CIA gave them
[13:09.560 --> 13:14.240]  a an advanced notice that they're going to dump the price of oil just by
[13:14.240 --> 13:18.200]  maintaining production where it was because demand worldwide is falling so
[13:18.200 --> 13:21.760]  quickly but of course nothing to worry about there we're told continually by
[13:21.760 --> 13:26.440]  this administration that everything is wonderful the economy is doing great
[13:26.440 --> 13:32.360]  we've got great employment figures and every economic metric as we were told
[13:32.360 --> 13:36.000]  at the State of the Union Obama's recent State of the Union every economic
[13:36.000 --> 13:42.480]  metric is up well that simply isn't true but if we're going to get so excited
[13:42.480 --> 13:47.240]  about these videos that we're going to go to war because they've tried to they've
[13:47.240 --> 13:52.360]  created other atrocities and tried to blame them on the other side false flags
[13:52.360 --> 13:56.400]  that we saw happening in Syria a year ago trying to go the American public
[13:56.400 --> 14:01.800]  trying to go the West into an all-out war again if we're going to do that let's
[14:01.800 --> 14:07.240]  at least demand that our allies in Saudi Arabia that our allies in Turkey stop
[14:07.240 --> 14:12.080]  this type of stuff maybe that would be a start now the main thrust I want to talk
[14:12.080 --> 14:16.200]  about today is is not that however I really want to talk about how things
[14:16.200 --> 14:21.400]  are falling apart in America the means of the takedown of the American state and
[14:21.400 --> 14:24.200]  of course this is an incremental story this has been going on for a long time
[14:24.200 --> 14:30.040]  but now we see the public joining in with strident claims that we have to get
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.840]  rid of individual liberty though we have to get rid of informed consent we see
[14:34.840 --> 14:40.120]  the LA Times talking about we're going to look at removing the personal belief
[14:40.120 --> 14:44.960]  exemption said that's the way they twist the language of informed consent they
[14:44.960 --> 14:50.200]  don't want to say we're going to move to stop informed consent at last that was
[14:50.200 --> 14:55.640]  the LA Times headline instead what they say at the LA Times is California is
[14:55.640 --> 15:01.360]  going to move to end personal belief exemptions at last so you shouldn't have
[15:01.360 --> 15:08.160]  any exemptions for that we've got Chris Cuomo son of Mario Cuomo on television
[15:08.160 --> 15:14.440]  on CNN saying our rights do not come from God obviously he could care less what
[15:14.440 --> 15:17.840]  our founding principles were in this country what our founding document said
[15:17.840 --> 15:22.080]  of course the Declaration of Independence which basically lays the
[15:22.080 --> 15:26.960]  fundamental theory of our government says that of course all these rights do
[15:26.960 --> 15:30.560]  come from God we hold these truths to be self-evident all men are created equal
[15:30.560 --> 15:34.480]  endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights but he says no no no
[15:34.480 --> 15:39.240]  our rights don't come from God he said on CNN he said our laws come from
[15:39.240 --> 15:44.320]  collective agreement and compromise this story that's on New American hits it on
[15:44.320 --> 15:51.080]  the head they said he is confusing laws with rights our rights come from God our
[15:51.080 --> 15:56.920]  laws are made by men and the point of the Declaration of Independence was to
[15:56.920 --> 16:02.080]  say that we create governments in order to protect those God-given individual
[16:02.080 --> 16:06.400]  rights but we've lost sight of that so we have a situation now we've got the
[16:06.400 --> 16:12.160]  vast majority of the public clamoring to shut down informed consent over measles
[16:12.160 --> 16:19.000]  this is not even Ebola this is measles people my age know that it was very very
[16:19.000 --> 16:23.320]  common it was not life-threatening and yet we see the shrill cries we see this
[16:23.320 --> 16:29.680]  woman in the story that was picked up by Kit Daniels last last week here's the
[16:29.680 --> 16:34.080]  headline from Daily Mail mom's angry Facebook post lashing out at anti
[16:34.080 --> 16:38.760]  vaxxers as her 15 day old son's life hangs in the balance from measles it
[16:38.760 --> 16:43.560]  sounds like he's got measles he's critically ill guess what he doesn't
[16:43.560 --> 16:47.360]  have measles he had to wait a few more days to find out he had measles the
[16:47.360 --> 16:54.920]  three-month quarantine that they've inflicted on him is up either today or
[16:54.920 --> 16:59.760]  tomorrow depending on which news store she look at but then she writes this
[16:59.760 --> 17:05.280]  post with a lot of straw man attacks against people who don't give their
[17:05.280 --> 17:09.840]  informed consent and she doesn't offer any reasons for it just lashes out at
[17:09.840 --> 17:13.200]  them for the collective this is what we're seeing over and over again this is
[17:13.200 --> 17:17.840]  what we're seeing actually with the Keystone project we can talk about
[17:17.840 --> 17:22.160]  whether a pipeline is the safest way to transport crude oil I think it
[17:22.160 --> 17:27.080]  probably is probably the safest and cheapest way to move that around we can
[17:27.080 --> 17:31.880]  talk about whether or not it's going to increase pollution as the
[17:31.880 --> 17:35.760]  environmentalists are concerned about because the form of that oil nevertheless
[17:35.760 --> 17:39.520]  it's going to be refined either in the United States or it's going to be shipped
[17:39.520 --> 17:44.360]  across the ocean and refined in China that's a net wash but here's the crux
[17:44.360 --> 17:51.640]  for me this is using imminent domain for a foreign corporation to take private
[17:51.640 --> 17:58.400]  property away from American citizens taking away private property from people
[17:58.400 --> 18:02.320]  who have had farms for over a hundred years in many cases in Nebraska handing
[18:02.320 --> 18:08.240]  it to a trans-Canada Canadian multinational corporation that says I
[18:08.240 --> 18:13.040]  want your property and the government is coming in and giving them imminent
[18:13.040 --> 18:17.680]  domain status this is what we see happening with the Keystone project
[18:17.680 --> 18:23.360]  it's absolutely wrong for the government then there's no constitutional support
[18:23.360 --> 18:29.520]  for this if we go back and we look at what happened in the kilo case 10 years
[18:29.520 --> 18:35.520]  ago that essentially began a precedent saying that one private company can take
[18:35.520 --> 18:41.080]  land from another private individual and say that it's in the greater public
[18:41.080 --> 18:46.080]  good that is not not what the Constitution says the Constitution says
[18:46.080 --> 18:52.240]  that you must give compensation if you're taking it for public use if private
[18:52.240 --> 18:56.920]  property is taken for public use there has to be compensation that is not what
[18:56.920 --> 19:00.840]  happened with Kello when the Supreme Court said that they were wrong they
[19:00.840 --> 19:06.160]  violated the Constitution and it's about to go to an even worse level here
[19:06.160 --> 19:10.600]  where you've got a foreign corporation coming in and taking that away from
[19:10.600 --> 19:14.800]  someone domestically of course it's all about jobs according to Republicans
[19:14.800 --> 19:19.480]  whenever the Republicans start talking or any party starts talking about how
[19:19.480 --> 19:25.920]  they are going to create jobs watch your back governments don't create jobs
[19:25.920 --> 19:31.680]  they create bureaucracies and they create regulations but it's only by taking
[19:31.680 --> 19:36.720]  those regulations away that jobs are created they're gonna have about 40,000
[19:36.720 --> 19:40.280]  jobs to build this pipeline but once that's finished it's going to be less
[19:40.280 --> 19:45.960]  than a hundred we're going to live with the loss of private property rights long
[19:45.960 --> 19:49.080]  after the jobs of the Keystone Pipeline are gone stay with us we'll be right
[19:49.080 --> 19:51.280]  back

[24:11.920 --> 24:16.200]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight your host today Alex Jones
[24:16.200 --> 24:20.000]  will be joining us in the second hour as will Joyce Riley Alex will be
[24:20.000 --> 24:25.280]  interviewing Joyce Riley from the power hour at the noon hour if you're
[24:25.280 --> 24:29.320]  listening in the central time zone but it's gonna be in about a half hour at
[24:29.320 --> 24:34.080]  the top of the hour now I was talking just before we went to break about the
[24:34.080 --> 24:38.520]  erosions against individual rights against informed consent against private
[24:38.520 --> 24:43.760]  property we see anchors on CNN Chris Cuomo saying our rights don't come from
[24:43.760 --> 24:48.920]  God our rights come from the collective from the laws that we pass in other words
[24:48.920 --> 24:54.680]  everything is prohibited unless expressly permitted we determine what
[24:54.680 --> 24:58.880]  you're going to be able to do we grant you privileges you don't have rights
[24:58.880 --> 25:03.720]  that come from God no you're granted privileges from the government from the
[25:03.720 --> 25:07.280]  collective that's essentially what they're saying and so we see others in
[25:07.280 --> 25:12.800]  the media like the LA Times applauding the new flexibility of Governor Jerry
[25:12.800 --> 25:18.920]  Brown and considering mandates you see how they've turned that upside down if
[25:18.920 --> 25:24.920]  you want to mandate medical treatment against people without their informed
[25:24.920 --> 25:29.520]  consent which is what the Nuremberg codes were set up for the Nuremberg codes
[25:29.520 --> 25:36.560]  established informed consent as the gold standard I interviewed Jane Orient MD
[25:36.560 --> 25:43.360]  last week and she was talking about how that is the essence of the doctor
[25:43.360 --> 25:48.440]  patient relationship but of course we see that they're intruding with mandates
[25:48.440 --> 25:54.280]  like Obamacare on to that doctor patient relationship third parties are coming
[25:54.280 --> 25:58.560]  in that have conflicts of interest whether they want to sell us insurance or
[25:58.560 --> 26:03.520]  whether they want to sell us vaccines we should be concerned about what the
[26:03.520 --> 26:08.080]  pharmaceutical companies are selling us this goes beyond the science of whether
[26:08.080 --> 26:12.160]  vaccines are safe and effective of course we are concerned about what they
[26:12.160 --> 26:16.560]  put into the vaccines in terms of preservatives in terms of adjuvants
[26:16.560 --> 26:21.920]  things that are designed to provoke the immune system the number of vaccines
[26:21.920 --> 26:27.160]  that are given the collective addition of these vaccines giving multiple
[26:27.160 --> 26:31.560]  vaccines at the same time at an early age all of these things are very
[26:31.560 --> 26:36.960]  different scientific question to whether or not vaccines by themselves an
[26:36.960 --> 26:41.720]  individual vaccine that is clean without preservatives without adjuvants that is
[26:41.720 --> 26:47.440]  given without a dozen other vaccines at the same time those are separate issues
[26:47.440 --> 26:52.800]  and of course it comes to the integrity of the pharmaceutical companies and the
[26:52.800 --> 26:58.440]  FDA consider this article right here the FDA doesn't even test the safety of
[26:58.440 --> 27:03.480]  genetically engineered food this is from Washington's blog USA Today reports and
[27:03.480 --> 27:08.320]  they have a question and answer with the FDA over GMO foods they say does the FDA
[27:08.320 --> 27:13.080]  test these foods before they're allowed on the market the answer is no instead
[27:13.080 --> 27:18.920]  there is a voluntary consultation process genetically engineered foods are
[27:18.920 --> 27:24.160]  overseen by the FDA but there is no approval process foods are presumed to
[27:24.160 --> 27:29.800]  be safe unless the FDA has evidence to the contrary says Jeff Jeffy the FDA
[27:29.800 --> 27:33.280]  quote has to show that there may be a problem with the food as opposed to the
[27:33.280 --> 27:36.840]  company needing to prove that it's safe to the FDA satisfaction before it can
[27:36.840 --> 27:40.840]  get on the market hey I would be fine with that if that was a way that
[27:40.840 --> 27:45.640]  government operated in every other respect the only people who are presumed
[27:45.640 --> 27:50.240]  to be innocent of course are the multinational corporations that have
[27:50.240 --> 27:55.400]  captured the regulatory agencies the rest of us we have to apply for
[27:55.400 --> 27:59.280]  permission for everything that we do you want to try to take some kind of a
[27:59.280 --> 28:05.840]  painkiller to help you if you're suffering from cancer now you have to
[28:05.840 --> 28:08.840]  get the FDA's permission for that or maybe the DEA because we know that
[28:08.840 --> 28:13.840]  marijuana is very effective at stopping nausea very effective at stopping
[28:13.840 --> 28:20.320]  pain very effective at treating glaucoma no we can't have that because the
[28:20.320 --> 28:24.720]  government doesn't permit that it's prohibited where did they get the
[28:24.720 --> 28:27.520]  authority for that where's the constitutional amendment for that they
[28:27.520 --> 28:30.960]  had to have a constitutional amendment to prohibit alcohol and another one to
[28:30.960 --> 28:34.880]  make it legal again they never passed a constitutional amendment they gave them
[28:34.880 --> 28:38.600]  a right to prohibit anything but of course the FDA acts the way that it
[28:38.600 --> 28:43.000]  should to the rest of us only when it comes to a giant corporation like
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.320]  Monsanto I think it's very revealing if we look at this article that came up
[28:47.320 --> 28:52.560]  this is a transcript that I printed from NPR's morning edition and they were
[28:52.560 --> 28:56.560]  talking about the fight between a couple of different plastics manufacturers of
[28:56.560 --> 29:02.320]  course we all know that there's issues with BPA we know that it has hormone
[29:02.320 --> 29:07.280]  related health problems as they point out in large doses in other words if they
[29:07.280 --> 29:11.520]  put it in every kind of container that you eat or drink out of which is what
[29:11.520 --> 29:16.560]  they do in America BPA in large doses causes hormone related health problems
[29:16.560 --> 29:21.680]  in animals yeah like humans but they don't want to say humans they they jump
[29:21.680 --> 29:25.680]  around that and then they get into a back-and-forth competition with another
[29:25.680 --> 29:30.360]  company that came up with a competing prod product Trident we're gonna talk
[29:30.360 --> 29:34.800]  about what they say about the scientific method because it's very
[29:34.800 --> 29:49.720]  important in this debate about vaccines stay with us we'll be right back we're

[33:34.400 --> 33:40.320]  Monday February 16th 2015 Alex will be joining us in the next hour along with
[33:40.320 --> 33:46.800]  Joyce Riley host of the power hour that you can also hear here on GCN I was
[33:46.800 --> 33:51.960]  talking just before the break about a fight going on between some plastics
[33:51.960 --> 33:56.320]  manufacturers and what that tells us about the scientific process but before
[33:56.320 --> 34:00.080]  I do before I get onto that again just want to tell you that this hour is
[34:00.080 --> 34:04.040]  brought to you by the products that we sell at info wars life comm course
[34:04.040 --> 34:07.320]  that's what helps to fund this operation a key part of funding this
[34:07.320 --> 34:11.240]  operation we have some specials this month we have a February special that is
[34:11.240 --> 34:15.640]  20% off of super male and super female vitality and of course those are
[34:15.640 --> 34:19.080]  products specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper hormone
[34:19.080 --> 34:24.520]  balance to create superior vitality males and females it's a formula that is
[34:24.520 --> 34:29.720]  completely free of GMOs harmful additives gluten and is made in the USA again
[34:29.720 --> 34:35.560]  February special 20% off of super male or super female vitality we also have
[34:35.560 --> 34:41.080]  another special by two survival shield x2 and get one ancient defense free that's
[34:41.080 --> 34:45.640]  our new flagship product their ancient defenses just come out you can get one
[34:45.640 --> 34:50.400]  of those for free when you buy two survival shield x2 nascent iodine and
[34:50.400 --> 34:53.880]  just before the break we're talking about this story that I saw it's a
[34:53.880 --> 34:58.680]  transcript I have here from NPR talking about the fight between the people who
[34:58.680 --> 35:05.040]  make BPA and the people who make a BPA free plastic Triton and of course as
[35:05.040 --> 35:09.880]  they point out we all know that BPA taken in large doses causes hormone related
[35:09.880 --> 35:14.440]  health problems in animals of course the large doses that we get means that
[35:14.440 --> 35:20.280]  virtually all plastics that they put drinks as well as food lining the cans
[35:20.280 --> 35:25.560]  of canned foods in many cases with BPA plastics of course we are getting that
[35:25.560 --> 35:30.600]  in large doses and it's not just animals that have problems with it it has
[35:30.600 --> 35:35.080]  problems for humans because we are animals in that respect as well now
[35:35.080 --> 35:37.880]  they point out that these two companies were going back and forth making
[35:37.880 --> 35:42.440]  claims and counterclaims they get into an argument they get into a lawsuit
[35:42.440 --> 35:46.480]  about this they've all got their own experts and studies backing their
[35:46.480 --> 35:49.840]  positions they argue they say at length about which test should be used to
[35:49.840 --> 35:54.960]  establish whether a product had estrogenic activity in other words both of
[35:54.960 --> 36:00.280]  these plastics apparently under certain circumstances create estrogen problems
[36:00.280 --> 36:04.040]  creating problems for males lowering the fertility rate doing many other things
[36:04.040 --> 36:07.840]  as Alex has talked about many times the effects of these plastics but here's the
[36:07.840 --> 36:12.920]  key thing this is what they came down to the bottom line they said the test
[36:12.920 --> 36:18.520]  results that we have that doesn't limit our research in a scientific context he
[36:18.520 --> 36:21.880]  says our companies are getting their message out by publishing scientific
[36:21.880 --> 36:26.800]  papers about estrogenic plastics that specifically mention each other's
[36:26.800 --> 36:31.400]  products he says the tactic seems to be working I think people are recognizing
[36:31.400 --> 36:35.880]  that it's not the courts that determine scientific questions it's not the
[36:35.880 --> 36:42.800]  government of California it's not LA Times it's not Chris Cuomo its truth is
[36:42.800 --> 36:48.080]  not determined by democratic vote it's not determined by majority opinion most
[36:48.080 --> 36:53.120]  of the time the scientific consensus about most things has been wrong Louis
[36:53.120 --> 36:56.480]  Pasteur had to fight against the scientific consensus to get people to
[36:56.480 --> 37:01.800]  understand the germ theory most of the time the scientific consensus is wrong
[37:01.800 --> 37:05.880]  you advance science by questioning conventional wisdom and here's some
[37:05.880 --> 37:09.560]  questions for the people who put out mandatory vaccines and as I point out
[37:09.560 --> 37:14.560]  we have an article actually an interview it's up on the YouTube channel an
[37:14.560 --> 37:19.640]  interview that I had with Jane Orient Dr. Jane Orient MD she's with the
[37:19.640 --> 37:24.200]  Association of American Physicians and Surgeons she's the executive director
[37:24.200 --> 37:30.000]  and I thought they had some very good questions that they asked the CDC and a
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.840]  FOIA request three years ago now they asked for things like describe the
[37:34.840 --> 37:38.480]  potential conflicts of interest that you may have in recommending vaccines this
[37:38.480 --> 37:43.640]  is to the CDC tell us what tests you've done to determine the duration of the
[37:43.640 --> 37:47.880]  protection of vaccines tell us the safety and the efficacy testing of the
[37:47.880 --> 37:52.760]  influenza vaccine give us documents that describe the long term safety studies
[37:52.760 --> 37:57.960]  of children and adults who have received five or more annual doses of the flu
[37:57.960 --> 38:03.400]  vaccine give us tests that you've conducted for possible viral or
[38:03.400 --> 38:07.680]  bacterial contaminants in vaccines we'd like to know what safety testing you've
[38:07.680 --> 38:11.600]  done for thimerosal that's mercury in children and adults would like to know
[38:11.600 --> 38:15.960]  any testing that you've done of thimerosal or other vaccine components
[38:15.960 --> 38:19.800]  for potential adjuvant effects that's irritant effects of the immune system
[38:19.800 --> 38:22.960]  would like to know any investigations that you've had for the potential of any
[38:22.960 --> 38:27.320]  components with adjuvant-like effect for inducing allergies to vaccine
[38:27.320 --> 38:31.760]  components which recipient is condensed to coincidentally exposed to like
[38:31.760 --> 38:35.760]  peanuts or pollen would like to know what the absentee rates and school
[38:35.760 --> 38:39.880]  children and health care workers are who have or have not received the flu
[38:39.880 --> 38:45.240]  vaccine including time off for adverse reactions to the flu vaccine would like
[38:45.240 --> 38:48.040]  to know if you've compared the effectiveness of immunization of
[38:48.040 --> 38:52.080]  personnel versus other methods of protecting patients against acquiring
[38:52.080 --> 38:56.920]  influenza in-house for example using UV lights to sanitize the air which we
[38:56.920 --> 39:02.880]  saw them doing with the Ebola outbreak they have a UV machine that can come in
[39:02.880 --> 39:08.600]  and sanitize an entire room without people being in there so these are
[39:08.600 --> 39:12.840]  questions that need to be asked where are the studies show me the studies oh
[39:12.840 --> 39:16.400]  that's right you haven't done the study studies or you don't want to show me the
[39:16.400 --> 39:22.200]  studies that you've done then don't ask me to trust the CDC or the pharmaceutical
[39:22.200 --> 39:27.520]  industry I certainly understand what vaccines are about I understand the
[39:27.520 --> 39:31.760]  process of passive immunity we talked about that when Ebola was an outbreak
[39:31.760 --> 39:35.840]  the idea that you would use the antibodies that somebody who survived
[39:35.840 --> 39:39.600]  the disease had produced human antibodies and you would transfer those
[39:39.600 --> 39:43.640]  human antibodies to someone else with a convalescent serum I understand that
[39:43.640 --> 39:48.120]  I understand active immunity where you give somebody a weakened or dead version
[39:48.120 --> 39:55.120]  of the disease and hope that their body produces its own antibodies to deal with
[39:55.120 --> 39:58.360]  that that's active immunity I understand the principle of both of those things
[39:58.360 --> 40:01.480]  but you understand that they then turn around and change that we talked about
[40:01.480 --> 40:06.200]  that with the Ebola we said look people who are recovering from this and almost
[40:06.200 --> 40:09.200]  all of the cases that we've seen here in the West they've all had this
[40:09.200 --> 40:14.000]  convalescent serum virtually every single patient and they were passing this
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.200]  on the doctors and nurses because they had seen this work in the country but
[40:18.200 --> 40:23.000]  then what the media wanted to produce was the pharmaceutical version of this
[40:23.000 --> 40:27.680]  the artificial version of this where they would inject monkeys with Ebola and
[40:27.680 --> 40:31.800]  they would get monkey antibodies and then they would genetically modify those
[40:31.800 --> 40:37.080]  monkey antibodies to presumably work better with humans then they would take
[40:37.080 --> 40:41.080]  those genetically modified monkey antibodies and they would put them in a
[40:41.080 --> 40:45.120]  genetically modified tobacco plant and grow them then they would take this
[40:45.120 --> 40:50.080]  Frankenstein substance and inject it into you talking about how hey if this
[40:50.080 --> 40:54.320]  Ebola outbreak gets too far along we're not going to be able to take the time to
[40:54.320 --> 40:57.320]  do the kind of testing that we'd like to do we're just going to have to start
[40:57.320 --> 41:04.040]  injecting people with this that's the difference where they go from transferring
[41:04.040 --> 41:09.400]  convalescent serum from one person to the other to a monkey-generated antibody
[41:09.400 --> 41:14.200]  that they grow into a in a genetically modified tobacco plant because they can
[41:14.200 --> 41:18.440]  make money from that they can't make that much money just doing blood
[41:18.440 --> 41:23.880]  transfusions but they can make a lot of money doing Z-Map and things like that
[41:23.880 --> 41:28.160]  so that's what we're looking at that's what you need to have if you're going to
[41:28.160 --> 41:33.120]  have informed consent yeah we have this case that came out last week and it was
[41:33.120 --> 41:38.480]  up on info wars.com Kit Daniels had this story about the angry mom and of
[41:38.480 --> 41:42.440]  course the way that it was hyped in the media and the Daily Mail saying her son
[41:42.440 --> 41:49.160]  her 15 day old son's life hangs in the balance for measles because of you know
[41:49.160 --> 41:57.080]  anti-vaccine people well the reality is that her son didn't even have measles
[41:57.080 --> 42:01.360]  and I haven't seen I've been following this and I'm sure that if he did come
[42:01.360 --> 42:06.840]  down with measles there's only one or two days left in the watching period I'm
[42:06.840 --> 42:12.440]  sure that if Jennifer Hibman White's 15 day old son had come down with measles
[42:12.440 --> 42:16.480]  I'm sure they would be telling this to everybody but here's the catch right
[42:16.480 --> 42:22.240]  here when it was reported in the Canadian television report they pointed out
[42:22.240 --> 42:26.880]  that the person who was in the waiting room say she took her child to a
[42:26.880 --> 42:33.520]  hospital waiting room at 15 days old that's perhaps the Canadian socialist
[42:33.520 --> 42:38.000]  healthcare system I don't know personally I wouldn't take my 15 day old child
[42:38.000 --> 42:43.120]  into an emergency room to wait for a routine checkup nevertheless she did
[42:43.120 --> 42:46.200]  and there was somebody who was there who was sick as you would expect in a
[42:46.200 --> 42:51.520]  emergency waiting room hospital waiting room this person who had measles was
[42:51.520 --> 42:56.280]  there a couple of hours before she was and did have measles guess what it wasn't
[42:56.280 --> 43:04.560]  an unvaccinated person no it was a 30 year old man who had been vaccinated so
[43:04.560 --> 43:10.400]  she's angry at the unvaccinated people she brings up amazing straw man
[43:10.400 --> 43:16.000]  arguments let's run the report from that Canadian TV news report they have some
[43:16.000 --> 43:19.080]  of her quotes and we're going to stop this as we go through it and comment on
[43:19.080 --> 43:24.440]  some of these quotes run that tape guys now to a mother outraged at parents who
[43:24.440 --> 43:29.160]  do not vaccinate their children she took the social media and her emotionally
[43:29.160 --> 43:34.120]  charged post is gaining steam you see her newborn son may have been exposed to
[43:34.120 --> 43:38.600]  measles last late last month and she does not yet know if he has the virus
[43:38.600 --> 43:44.960]  here's ctv's Janice Golding measles is a potentially deadly disease and Jennifer
[43:44.960 --> 43:49.040]  Hibben White has learned her newborn son Griffin may have been exposed in a
[43:49.040 --> 43:55.160]  mark of doctor's office on January 27th she writes I'm angry angry as hell the
[43:55.160 --> 43:58.600]  pickering mom of two doesn't blame the person who sought medical help but on
[43:58.600 --> 44:03.360]  Facebook she posted if you have chosen to not vaccinate yourself or your child I
[44:03.360 --> 44:07.800]  blame you I blame you you have stood on the shoulders of our collective
[44:07.800 --> 44:11.560]  protection for too long from that high height we okay let's hold that right there
[44:11.560 --> 44:14.960]  do you catch that our collective protection you stood on the shoulders of
[44:14.960 --> 44:20.120]  our collective protection I blame you if you're not vaccinated yet the person
[44:20.120 --> 44:23.440]  that was in the emergency room was a vaccinated person that's not supposed to
[44:23.440 --> 44:27.480]  happen and according to their theory somebody who gets measles as a
[44:27.480 --> 44:31.040]  vaccinated person isn't supposed to be able to pass that on yet we've seen that
[44:31.040 --> 44:34.000]  happen time and again I want to read one more quote and then we've got Alex
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.280]  Jones is called in on the phone she said basically you have stood on our
[44:38.280 --> 44:43.320]  collective shoulders we are concerned world citizens and we're not going to
[44:43.320 --> 44:46.880]  allow this anymore in other words we're just going to force you bringing up
[44:46.880 --> 44:50.600]  things like you think you can protect your kids by eating a shovel full of
[44:50.600 --> 44:57.200]  dirt by dancing by kennelite and a full moon talk about strawman arguments is
[44:57.200 --> 45:01.480]  one of the most unbelievable posts I've seen and yet it's been shared over a
[45:01.480 --> 45:05.680]  quarter of a million times that's the mentality that we have to guard against
[45:05.680 --> 45:10.440]  let's go to Alex Jones who's just called in Alex go ahead
[45:10.440 --> 45:15.240]  okay so yeah we're going to get to Alex in just a moment I think we had a
[45:15.240 --> 45:19.680]  little bit of a glitch there on our phone line let me continue on with what
[45:19.680 --> 45:26.320]  she has to say here she says we let you be so privileged thanks to our
[45:26.320 --> 45:29.960]  willingness to vaccinate ourselves and our children but she doesn't have any
[45:29.960 --> 45:35.680]  tolerance anymore in other words you don't have the freedom to make decisions
[45:35.680 --> 45:41.320]  about yourself about other people you have a privilege we allow you the
[45:41.320 --> 45:45.960]  privilege of not getting a vaccine but we're going to bring that to an end she
[45:45.960 --> 45:50.120]  says of course your kids not going to develop autism which they wouldn't
[45:50.120 --> 45:54.840]  because of science that's her that's her explanation because of science so she
[45:54.840 --> 45:58.920]  accuses us of thinking we're going to protect our kids by dancing by
[45:58.920 --> 46:04.560]  kennelite in the full moon by giving them shovels full of dirt and yet she
[46:04.560 --> 46:10.440]  doesn't offer any justification for the quote-unquote science as I just
[46:10.440 --> 46:15.880]  mentioned it's not the science it's about the vaccine it's the same as we
[46:15.880 --> 46:21.040]  talked about before about french fries that are sold in a fast food scenario
[46:21.040 --> 46:26.120]  it's not simply potatoes when McDonald's has 19 different ingredients some of
[46:26.120 --> 46:31.480]  them pretty heavy preservatives they fry it in a chemical that is a key
[46:31.480 --> 46:36.800]  ingredient and silly putty when they do that it is no longer merely potatoes it
[46:36.800 --> 46:41.160]  becomes special french fries that you can put under a glass as they've done in
[46:41.160 --> 46:46.280]  Iceland along with a cheeseburger that is now six years old and hasn't changed a
[46:46.280 --> 46:52.000]  bit and that's the issue don't tell me that I'm getting just potatoes when you
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.920]  give me some fast food fries it's not simply that and if this lady would go
[46:56.920 --> 47:01.720]  back and ask some of these questions that the CDC refuses to produce the
[47:01.720 --> 47:05.920]  information they sent a FOIA request this is the American Association of
[47:05.920 --> 47:09.120]  Physicians and Surgeons they sent a FOIA request a couple years ago and you
[47:09.120 --> 47:13.760]  know what they heard back crickets chirping total silence they haven't
[47:13.760 --> 47:18.320]  received any answers to conflicts of interest to what tests have you done to
[47:18.320 --> 47:23.680]  test for the efficacy of this what have you done to test for the long-term
[47:23.680 --> 47:27.000]  effects of these vaccines and on and on I just read all those detailed things
[47:27.000 --> 47:31.960]  off nobody has received any of this information when I don't get the
[47:31.960 --> 47:36.280]  information I'm not informed if I'm not informed you're not going to get my
[47:36.280 --> 47:40.280]  consent unless you destroy our individual rights and of course that is a
[47:40.280 --> 47:46.560]  key part of what Obamacare was about Obamacare was about destroying our
[47:46.560 --> 47:50.200]  ability to make our own health care decisions because when the government
[47:50.200 --> 47:53.000]  pays for our health care and that's where they're headed with this it's not
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.680]  right now it's a massive transfer of wealth from individuals to insurance
[47:57.680 --> 48:01.640]  companies who are selling us inflated insurance policies that may or may not
[48:01.640 --> 48:05.600]  get us health care you understand the difference between having health care
[48:05.600 --> 48:09.920]  and having health insurance I hope so you realize of course that health
[48:09.920 --> 48:13.880]  insurance is not always going to get you health care and when they make single
[48:13.880 --> 48:21.480]  men by pregnancy coverage something's going on here the same thing is true
[48:21.480 --> 48:25.920]  when we're looking at mandatory vaccines when you've got the the pharmaceutical
[48:25.920 --> 48:29.560]  companies selling vaccines out of virtually every retail location they
[48:29.560 --> 48:33.320]  have a sold them out of McDonald's they were giving away vaccines they had
[48:33.320 --> 48:39.520]  mold you could go there and get shot up with MMR you could get the tetanus
[48:39.520 --> 48:44.480]  shot you get a staff shot there you could get hepatitis a I totaled up it
[48:44.480 --> 48:49.800]  was like eight or nine vaccines you could get right then what is that going
[48:49.800 --> 48:55.000]  to do as dr. Wakefield said when Alex Jones interviewed him last week he said
[48:55.000 --> 48:58.560]  it isn't when you look at these vaccines it isn't one plus one plus one
[48:58.560 --> 49:04.760]  equals three it equals something that is completely different and his point being
[49:04.760 --> 49:09.880]  was that he wanted to see instead of the MMR being given to children to space
[49:09.880 --> 49:15.560]  these things out and he said when they did that in Japan they saw a drop in the
[49:15.560 --> 49:20.280]  autism rate but then the autism rate started going back up again and as
[49:20.280 --> 49:23.880]  dr. Wakefield pointed out they stood they looked at it and they found that
[49:23.880 --> 49:29.600]  even though they had now separated this out into three distinct vaccines they
[49:29.600 --> 49:34.800]  had begun the practice of giving those vaccines on the same day essentially the
[49:34.800 --> 49:41.040]  same effect is doing an MMR that's the question that's the concern that we have
[49:41.040 --> 49:45.240]  and when you look at the situation where they come back and they say is the
[49:45.240 --> 49:50.720]  AAPS also had facts on mandatory vaccines they talked about adverse
[49:50.720 --> 49:54.080]  reactions to the hepatitis B they said well of course that's less than 1% but
[49:54.080 --> 49:59.000]  understand that if you're giving that to 70 million American children that's
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.440]  going to be 700,000 children that are going to have adverse effects I think
[50:03.440 --> 50:07.600]  we've got Alex Jones back on the line Alex are you there yes I am David thank

[54:38.640 --> 54:42.720]  David again I should be back in tomorrow I'm working on some major breaking news
[54:42.720 --> 54:46.760]  and some corporate deals to get the broadcast expanded and syndicated to
[54:46.760 --> 54:50.640]  television that's why I've been missing a few days here and there of course I
[54:50.640 --> 54:54.120]  hosted live yesterday 4 to 6 p.m. I want to thank all of our affiliates and
[54:54.120 --> 54:57.840]  listeners out there but David you do such a great job when I'm tuned in and
[54:57.840 --> 55:02.560]  listening as you break all this down that I end up calling in early so thanks
[55:02.560 --> 55:07.400]  for letting me barge in here about 1015 minutes early today but wild horses
[55:07.400 --> 55:13.400]  could not drag me away what we see with the whole vaccine situation is epic
[55:13.400 --> 55:18.440]  people need to sit back and kind of not savor this moment but realize we're in
[55:18.440 --> 55:22.120]  the game having a huge effect having huge victories not just here in the US but
[55:22.120 --> 55:27.880]  all over the world if you really research what's unfolding it's a Brian
[55:27.880 --> 55:31.480]  Williams moment in fact I would headline your whole last 30 minute
[55:31.480 --> 55:37.160]  breakdown of vaccines vaccines Brian Williams moment because it's the moment
[55:37.160 --> 55:41.000]  when the facade collapses and the lies come out we've had the Merck whistle
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.680]  blower CDC whistleblowers two different ones one the head of the program admit
[55:45.680 --> 55:51.200]  that they were basically covering up autism links we've had the co-author of
[55:51.200 --> 55:56.160]  the Andrew Wakefield study in England exonerated his medical license given
[55:56.160 --> 56:00.320]  back and the court said yeah you engage in fraud to set this guy up basically
[56:00.320 --> 56:05.600]  you've got all the analysis coming out that vaccines are causing the diseases
[56:05.600 --> 56:10.520]  that they're full of all sorts of adulterants and so there's a public
[56:10.520 --> 56:16.840]  collapse in confidence in the system everyone I talked to basically is either
[56:16.840 --> 56:21.520]  totally against vaccines has been hurt by them or you know things that they can
[56:21.520 --> 56:25.600]  hurt you but it's overall better for you in the end but the numbers are coming in
[56:25.600 --> 56:30.120]  and so there's a Brian Williams moment so they're doubling and tripling and
[56:30.120 --> 56:34.840]  quadrupling down right now to push their agenda and to say we're gonna arrest
[56:34.840 --> 56:38.480]  you we're gonna kick you out of school we're gonna push where you live like
[56:38.480 --> 56:41.280]  you're a child molester if you don't take these we're gonna push for force
[56:41.280 --> 56:44.920]  inoculations we're not gonna let you fly domestically if you don't do this
[56:44.920 --> 56:50.120]  it's the beginning of the Obamacare media tyranny a medical tyranny where they
[56:50.120 --> 56:53.800]  all bully you and attack you into submitting to this and other social
[56:53.800 --> 56:58.360]  engineering so this is the big fight of course we've always been on it you've
[56:58.360 --> 57:03.040]  always been on it but now the big fight is front and center and everybody's got
[57:03.040 --> 57:07.320]  to let them have it I launched a video over the weekend that info wars
[57:07.320 --> 57:13.520]  declares war on vaccines not on the idea of inoculation and that you can learn
[57:13.520 --> 57:17.320]  immunity it's that they're given liability protection they don't protect
[57:17.320 --> 57:20.600]  you it's a total fraud there's a social engineering agenda we know they're
[57:20.600 --> 57:25.800]  engaged in social control dumbing down brain damaging infertility and this is
[57:25.800 --> 57:29.600]  our big fight this is our line in the sand they're physically trying to assault
[57:29.600 --> 57:33.000]  us with these trying to force us to take these trying to force us through
[57:33.000 --> 57:37.160]  collective medicine collectivist medicine to pay for all the damaged people
[57:37.160 --> 57:41.600]  that have autism and other neurological disorders they're collapsing so like
[57:41.600 --> 57:46.280]  battle the bowls they're counter launching and in that video titled info
[57:46.280 --> 57:52.600]  wars declares war really the title should be vaccine victims tell their
[57:52.600 --> 57:56.520]  story because what it's really all about and I want to repost it info wars
[57:56.520 --> 58:00.480]  calm retweeted and reface booked under that title it's a great title they came
[58:00.480 --> 58:06.480]  up with but the title we need is is is vaccine victims tell their story if
[58:06.480 --> 58:11.400]  everyone who's a vaccine victim arrest family that is or who died from it gets
[58:11.400 --> 58:15.280]  out puts out YouTube videos puts out letters to the editor we will as a
[58:15.280 --> 58:20.640]  title wave of victims crush the enemy so they've got a few fake victims whining
[58:20.640 --> 58:24.040]  and saying it's our fault they're sick when it's pure bull we've got to come
[58:24.040 --> 58:27.360]  out of the woodwork against the enemy in a counter offensive right now and we
[58:27.360 --> 58:31.120]  will crush them once and for all this is their Brian Williams moment I'm Alex

[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:53.360]  David again in the last hour you were breaking down the fact that Egypt is
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.760]  basically attacking al Qaeda forces that were put in charge by our government
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.240]  in NATO in Libya you also covered their full-out terrorization as they've done
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.240]  gun owners saying we'll publish your names in the newspaper where you live if
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:12.200]  you don't take vaccines it's your fault we're getting sick when if you've
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:23.000]  supposedly been vaccinated you are protected and it is a total fraud but
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.480]  they're gonna push this hoax to the end because their fraud is collapsing that's
[01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:31.360]  not my opinion it is the vaccine industries Brian Williams moment and we
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:37.000]  shot a video in prompt to Friday that we put out Saturday that is titled on
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.720]  YouTube and as the main featured video on our YouTube channel breaking down the
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.560]  fact that we're declaring war on the fraudulent vaccine industry and we need
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:51.080]  everybody who's a victim I mean when we open the phones up they just fill up
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.840]  with victims of vaccines where the doctors admitted to them that the vaccine
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:59.280]  hurt them Marcos Morales our live news director the doctor admitted to him that
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.400]  his daughter had a bad reaction to vaccines other people's doctors go yeah
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.840]  my child had a seizure it's normal they're now saying in the news having a
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:13.160]  seizure is normal folks that means your brain is in total collapse level when
[01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.800]  you're having a seizure and having an autoimmune response to these things that
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:22.040]  irrevocably lowers IQ it's beyond shock therapy according to dr. Blalock
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:27.720]  that's what they're inducing with these seizures there's so much autoimmune
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:33.040]  response in the brain that your brain has a seizure and short circuits this is
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:36.800]  what we're doing to our children with this sick group of globalists who openly
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.200]  say they want to forcefully reduce our numbers but they want to give us these
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.880]  vaccines to keep us safe when they've been caught David as you know all over
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:49.640]  the world secretly adding things to the vaccines to sterilize people you name it
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.120]  we need to have the 10 reasons not to take vaccines Paul Watson should write
[01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.600]  an article about this and break down the history of secret testing the secret of
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.680]  spiking vaccines the liability protection the social engineering aspects
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:04.240]  the fact that they lie and say it protects you when it doesn't why do
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:07.560]  you think they're pushing so hard right now David well I think what they're
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:12.880]  pushing Alex is a total blind faith in government and pharmaceutical companies
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.840]  I think what they're doing is they're rolling this back they're trying to roll
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:21.000]  back informed consent the very idea that of course is tied to Obamacare that's
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.840]  where we see that we don't even have a choice as to what kind of insurance we're
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:29.160]  going to have so why should we think that we're going to have a choice whether
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.360]  or not we're going to vaccinate our children to me that is the fundamental
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.760]  issue the science is very important because people need to understand that
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:40.480]  there are real issues about the safety and the effectiveness of these vaccines
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:46.360]  and we shouldn't have a blind faith in government or pharmaceutical companies
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:51.680]  that's a very dangerous stance to have absolutely and at a base level who
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.040]  really trust the government and the shadowy corporations involved in fact
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.160]  here's another angle no one's going with that I think is one of the biggest
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.680]  angles to really expose this both in reality but also from a PR position
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:08.600]  last number I saw in USA today a few years ago was something like 83% of
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:14.840]  vaccines are manufactured in China that are consumed in this country so we need
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:19.120]  to get Rob do the big master researcher or Kit Daniels or any of our other great
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:25.560]  researchers to dig up or CJ and whole crews go to it to research and find out
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.440]  the amount of pharmaceuticals statistically because some numbers are
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:33.200]  as high as 90% of the pharmaceuticals but the number I saw was 83% of the
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:37.200]  vaccines are being made the country known to basically taint everything and
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:41.760]  whatever it is you know 20 30 years ago I heard this argument well 20 30 years
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.400]  ago I didn't get seizures or get sick from vaccines because they gave you five
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:50.560]  vaccines 30 years ago it's now 36 they're trying to make mandatory some kids
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:56.120]  take more than 60 there are 60 out there popularly used 36 though the schools are
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:01.000]  trying to make you take versus five I mean this is a big deal for all of

[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:19.840]  joining us from a remote location is alex jones joining us from his studio
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:25.640]  at home we're also being joined this segment by Joyce Riley host of the power
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.920]  hour and I know that alex wanted to talk to Joyce about her struggle with cancer
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:34.480]  alex absolutely if Joyce can do it I'd like to invite her to join us for the
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:39.000]  whole hour her website is thepowerhour.com she's been on the show many
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:43.440]  times over the years she of course would go on routinely with Art Bell and then
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:48.960]  of course George Norrie I first remember interviewing her 20 years ago when I
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:56.880]  just had a local radio show on KJFK 98 9 FM here in Austin Texas and her coming
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:01.960]  to town with the Gulf War Vets Association exposing and getting a secret
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:08.160]  documents proving Gulf War syndrome was real now they admit it's real but for
[01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.680]  more than a decade they covered it up and Joyce basically ended up getting the
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:17.840]  Gulf War syndrome as well and there was a cocktail of issues causing that and I
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:22.680]  want her in the second half of the interview today to to specifically with
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:27.760]  you David co-hosting walk into that history Gulf War she was instrumental
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:34.800]  in helping stop the full implementation of the emergency states powers act that
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:42.480]  would force inoculations on citizens back in 2002 2003 they have tried this
[01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:48.000]  before but Joyce has missed some time recently on her morning show that comes
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:55.240]  on right before ours at GCN live.com or thepowerhour.com and I had heard that
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:00.480]  she was sick and then recently heard her talk about just how ill she was and I've
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:04.920]  been praying for her and others that I care about pretty much every day trying
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:08.120]  to keep her in my prayers I'd like folks to pray for Joyce I know she's a
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:12.640]  Christian she's she's got pretty serious cancer I'm gonna let her tell that story
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.160]  and try to shut up and not famously take over the whole interview but she's
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:19.840]  currently the host of the power hour on GCN Joyce Riley is a registered nurse
[01:10:19.840 --> 01:10:23.000]  who's been the director of nursing before institutions has been a heart
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.880]  lung liver and kidney transplant nurse she also serves a captain in the US
[01:10:26.880 --> 01:10:31.440]  Air Force in support of Operation Desert Storm flying active duty missions on C-130
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:36.600]  aircraft from Alaska to Cuba. Her experience as a medical legal testifying
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:39.920]  expert in medical malpractice trials gave her the background to investigate the
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:43.600]  truth about Gulf War illness she has since become an advocate for all
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:48.120]  veterans and citizens experimented on by our government. Joyce was a whistleblower
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:53.080]  in the famous baby death case in which nurse Janine Jones who now serves a
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:57.000]  life sentence the Texas prison system was convicted of causing injury they
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.800]  ended up catching her Joyce really kind of caught her. To many babies in Bayer
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:05.240]  County that's San Antonio Texas she presently serves a spokesman for the
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:10.080]  American Gulf War Veterans Association thepowerhour.com and she's fighting for
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:14.360]  her life as we all are every day but she's fighting hard right now folks. Joyce
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:19.040]  thank you so much for coming on we salute your work for humanity. Well thank
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:21.920]  you Alex and thank you David it's a pleasure to be here you know when I
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:27.040]  first heard David say that I'm fighting for my life and and stage 4 cancer it's
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:31.800]  kind of like who's he talking about I mean I can't believe that I'm actually
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.880]  hearing that about myself because I've been on the other side of it treating
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:41.200]  people for so long that had cancer and then all of a sudden to wake up every
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:47.040]  morning and think oh my gosh I have cancer it's just such a foreign thought
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:52.880]  and a foreign situation and it takes action it doesn't take you know I mean
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:57.680]  it is a mental issue to try and accept all of this because I didn't find out
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:02.640]  until the day before Thanksgiving when I went into the emergency room and they
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:09.280]  did an MRI and CT scan and they said you have spinal cancer really really badly
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:16.960]  and I was just like shocked you know really and so at that point they began
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:22.360]  emergency radiation believe it or not on Thanksgiving Day and I told the
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:26.320]  radiation oncologist I said this must be bad bad if you're doing it on
[01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:30.280]  Thanksgiving and he said absolutely he said if we didn't do it today you
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:35.560]  probably wouldn't be here so I I don't didn't realize how bad it was and so
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.360]  there's a lot of things I've learned from this that I would like to share with
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:44.360]  people that they need to know in advance because once you get cancer or
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.680]  once you are deeply embedded in the disease itself and a lot of people may
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:54.280]  have it and just don't know it like myself I didn't know it and so you need
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.400]  to be aware of what to do in advance because once you get there there's a
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:02.680]  lot of things that take place and it's really hard to try and do everything
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:06.720]  that needs to be done well I want to give you the floor with David Knight I'm
[01:13:06.720 --> 01:13:09.480]  going to be here in the background as well but if I don't just step back I'll
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:14.680]  get so emotional I'll be jumping in and probably start crying it touches us all
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:19.120]  my grandmother's made the decision not to fight breast cancer at 89 but she's
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:22.880]  been dealing with that the last few years so we're watching that progress we
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:27.520]  see cancer numbers as you know Joyce just pediatric cancer breast cancer it's all
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:31.880]  off the chart later I want you to give your real expert expertise on why it's
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:36.040]  skyrocketing in Western world not in third world areas the whole vaccine
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:39.680]  situation how it all ties together the medical tyranny and I want to invite you
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:42.560]  you know back for a part two of this interview as well but for the rest of
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:46.600]  the hour please you've got the floor David and I will just go in and out of
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:52.240]  break talk about your personal story and then expand on it okay well thank you
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:58.720]  but I my personal story I think is born out of a lot of fighting against issues
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:03.040]  just like you and I think what you do Alex and what David does and what all of
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.800]  us do on Genesis is we're fighting against things and it's taken a lot out
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:15.280]  of us because it's been sort of a rough road to try and fight those things fight
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:20.920]  the powers that be and then maintain a healthy lifestyle and do the things that
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:27.280]  you're supposed to do for yourself and I learned late about diet I learned very
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:32.840]  late that there were things that worked that there were things that were much
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.160]  better than anything that medicine can give us I mean you you've got to remember
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:42.440]  I was a nurse for many many years and I lectured at NIH I was involved in some
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:47.120]  of the most well some of the most critical things in medicine heart lung
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:52.640]  liver kidney transplant I used to fly out on those airplanes to go and get the
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:57.120]  organs in the operating rooms around the country and bring the organ back and
[01:14:57.120 --> 01:15:03.960]  you know that's very stressful also and and very a powerful time to be involved
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:09.440]  in doing that but I believed in medicine totally there was nothing that could
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.880]  have gotten me to believe that there was something that came from an herb or a
[01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:20.560]  plant or a spice that was going to make me better or anybody else better and so
[01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:24.840]  I thank you for this time Alex and I thank you for the fact that we can share
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:27.600]  this with other people because I know there's a lot of nurses and physicians
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:31.920]  that listen to Genesis that are reaching out and hungry for this information
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:35.520]  but you know I used to talk to the heart transplant doctors and I would say to
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:40.640]  them you know they are eating like junk diets and they would say that's okay
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.080]  because see some of those transplant patients would be in the hospital until
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:47.120]  they were transplanted like three months or four months they would be in the
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:54.320]  hospital and at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital in Texas in Houston they have a
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:59.840]  McDonald's built in the middle of the hospital so that everybody goes around
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:04.280]  the McDonald's and including Texas Children's Hospital which is there also
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:08.560]  and they ate that food and if you were to go down there at lunchtime that's
[01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:13.080]  where the doctors were eating and diet was never an issue diet was never
[01:16:13.080 --> 01:16:19.880]  important until I got sick from the Gulf War illness and what happened to me was
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:26.280]  I got 10 shots in one day when I was serving as a flight nurse and and
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:33.600]  working with the military you know I wrote in my I wrote in my journal I
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:38.440]  said I would have taken a hundred shots today just to serve my country I didn't
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:42.760]  know I didn't understand and I'd heard stories about people passing out all the
[01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:46.680]  time when they get their vaccines and there when they were giving the shots
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:52.760]  with especially with the shots with the guns but I didn't know I didn't
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.960]  understand and sure enough lo and behold about six months after I got those
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:02.520]  vaccines I also became ill I could barely walk I was in Houston at the time I
[01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:07.120]  was admitted to the hospital and they decided that I had a demodernating
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:12.800]  illness like MS but not quite they called it and could really barely function
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.400]  at that point now that was 1991 and that was just after the Gulf War and I think
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:23.080]  it's important to know that I did not deploy to the Middle East I was back
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.640]  filling missions here in the United States so it was not the oil well fires
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:32.040]  it was not the chemicals or biologicals that affected me it had to be when you
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:37.320]  take away everything else it had to be the vaccines sure lo and behold lo and
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:41.840]  behold I will never take a vaccine again as long as I live and I'm sure you
[01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:47.880]  both you both feel the same way nor will I ever give another vaccine they are
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:52.280]  deadly and since then I have seen so many people in the military that have
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.560]  become ill as a result of it and I would have to ask the question have we
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.840]  forgotten about all those Gulf War veterans that were sick with vaccines
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:03.400]  have we forgotten and has the pharmaceutical companies forgotten that
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:09.000]  they did those anthrax vaccines and and experimental vaccines that people
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.720]  wish they admitted may people say guys when I have we're gonna skip this
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:16.080]  network break right here Joyce to give you more time go ahead oh well thank you
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:20.880]  well yeah it in and all those people became ill as a result of those vaccines
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:28.080]  and they actually quietly made multiple sclerosis a compensable disorder in
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:33.880]  other words you could get compensated for MS if you reported that within one
[01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:40.280]  year of leaving the military now there were so many young men 17 18 19 20 that
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:46.680]  were getting MS and you never see MS in that population in young men ever that
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:51.440]  are younger no it's just not done and you don't see it but yet the Gulf War
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:57.200]  veterans in droves started getting that problem and so we started seeing a trend
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:02.000]  here with this demodernating disease so many people had which demodernating
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:07.760]  disease means the myelin sheath comes off of the nerve ending and it misfires
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:13.440]  horribly you're like you were talking about a having a seizure well this is
[01:19:13.440 --> 01:19:17.160]  like you're having a seizure but you're awake and you're alert and you can't
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.760]  stop your body from doing the things that it's doing and it was it was just
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:25.840]  horrible the pain and I know you're seeing it happen and I watched the
[01:19:25.840 --> 01:19:28.920]  congressional hearings of Marine Corps captains and people that were the best
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:33.280]  ship their lives and six months later you know a tracheotomy on a breathing
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:37.120]  machine in the congressional testimonies than dead months later saying help us
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:41.480]  help us and they wouldn't even help them or say it was real but the inserts as
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:45.760]  you know say can give you neurological disorders do you know of the 10 vaccines
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:49.680]  from your deep research which one you think was doing it or was it all of them
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:53.800]  together well I know that hepatitis B is one of the problem ones but the problem
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:57.120]  in the military is we got a lot of experimental vaccines and we did not
[01:19:57.120 --> 01:20:02.480]  we're not allowed to know what they were but I do believe though that the the
[01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:07.240]  hep B vaccine is one of the absolute worst for the demonic demonization
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.680]  that's what my dad says he's seen a lot of doctors that got sick when they take
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:15.280]  it he refuses when he was still practicing to take it mm-hmm and that's
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:21.000]  smart because even the person I cannot think of her name right now but she was
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:24.520]  at Baylor College of Medicine and you look up the originator of the hep B
[01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:29.480]  vaccine her brother became blind as a result of the hep B vaccine and she
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:35.520]  begged for people to remove it from the market I wouldn't do it yeah and so here
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:39.440]  I am now a nurse and they said well you must have a mental problem and I said
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:43.280]  wait a minute you know six months ago I was flying around playing mash in the
[01:20:43.280 --> 01:20:48.800]  air loving every minute of it I wasn't sick I was doing great and now I come
[01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:53.560]  back and I said and me and the other nurses were sick so I went to the
[01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:57.240]  commander of the unit Colonel mountain and said there's so many of us that are
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:01.560]  sick here so many what are we going to do and they said you're not sick they're
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:07.160]  not sick nobody's sick so then we go off to the VA and the VA says unbeknownst to
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:11.440]  us well you are in the reserve so you can't get treatment at the VA what a
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:16.120]  shock there not that I really wanted treatment from the VA but there's a few
[01:21:16.120 --> 01:21:19.840]  little disclaimers they don't tell you when you go in the military like if
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:24.320]  you're in the reserve or guard and you don't have so many days active duty you
[01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:30.000]  don't get the you don't get to to get the VA treatment well that's okay because I
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:34.360]  didn't really want it but I wanted to find out why we were all sick and that's
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:38.320]  what began that investigation that I was it was I was insatiable trying to figure
[01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:43.960]  out why we were all sick and sure enough that's when I turned up the information
[01:21:43.960 --> 01:21:48.160]  that the US government had sold biologicals and chemicals to Iraq just
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:52.560]  prior to the Gulf War and for anybody that doesn't believe that the United
[01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:58.960]  States set up that war and it's I'm going to leave here in about nine
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.840]  minutes I'm gonna still be listening I'm gonna let David take over so I don't
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:06.960]  interrupt and because I'm gonna be back tomorrow but what's so incredible is for
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:10.960]  people that don't know you broke with Dr. Doug Rocky and so many others on your
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:16.160]  show you broke literally more than half the news about Gulf War because I was
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:20.520]  following and covering you at the time when they denied it for a decade and
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:25.240]  let's remember they now basically admit most of this now in hindsight it's
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:30.120]  admitted so much of this so it just shows how later once it's not a big news
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:34.360]  issue they'll admit it and that they would not even try to give people
[01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:40.440]  treatment from the vaccines from the nerve gas from the DU the cocktail of
[01:22:40.440 --> 01:22:44.240]  things in country and out of country that was taking place please continue
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:51.600]  well it's all about money and it's all about illegal weapons sales and it's
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:56.280]  about pharmaceutical sales and so when I found that the US government had sold
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:59.880]  biologicals and chemicals to Iraq and I've got if anybody doesn't believe me I
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:04.760]  have the batch numbers and dates that they were sold and what was fascinating
[01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:10.640]  about this was that I then found some vaccine trials that were secret that
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:15.200]  were confidential that were going to be undertaken by the triceratist vaccine
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:22.320]  task force and with that I found that the government was doing experiments with
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:26.800]  the same biologicals that they had sold to Iraq in other words they wanted to
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:30.360]  try and see if they could create a vaccine that would be effective against
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:35.920]  what they were going to expose our troops to so therein lied really the
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:41.280]  crime for me to figure out now who was behind all of this and I actually took
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:45.280]  all the documents to my attorney I spread them all out on a huge table there
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:49.440]  the ones that showed that the US had sold biologicals to Iraq chemicals and
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:55.120]  the ones showing the vaccine trials and he told me after he looked at all the
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:01.040]  documents he was like pale and he said I'm no longer your attorney I will not
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:07.920]  watch after you I cannot do anything for you I could not fade the IRS audit that
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:13.800]  I would get if I would help you Wow and I said really and so he essentially shut
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.320]  the door on me and told me that was the last time I was going to come to see him
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:23.080]  and then Buchanan what was his name baby Buchanan was his sister
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:30.320]  Abbey Pat yeah then his campaign manager he was running for president that year
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.760]  his campaign manager came to my house all the way from North Carolina and he
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:37.960]  wanted to see the documents he said I've heard you on coast to coast and I hear
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:42.040]  what you've been saying and I want you to prove it to me beyond a shadow of a
[01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:46.040]  doubt and he said remember that yeah yeah and then Pat will take care of this
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.120]  and he will do this with the veterans sure enough I showed it to him and I
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:56.840]  mean this man was ill he was ill when we finished he came to me and he said I
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:02.360]  can't stomach it he said I had no idea and I said well is Pat gonna do anything
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:08.320]  about it and he said I don't know he said I had no idea it was this bad then
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:11.400]  one day I was traveling around the country doing them meetings and getting
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:16.560]  kicked out of American legions and VFWs because they had put out a message
[01:25:16.560 --> 01:25:23.520]  that I was not supposed to be in those facilities and and a US representative
[01:25:23.520 --> 01:25:28.880]  sent his team to come to talk to me and they called me over at the half time of
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.840]  the meeting and and during the break and they said the representative has a
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.280]  message for you and I said really and they said come over here and there were
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:41.280]  five of them that had come to this meeting and they were fiercely taking
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:47.880]  notes the representative wants you to know that he's not gonna support you and
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:52.520]  I said well nobody else is either why is that surprised me and I said why you
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:58.360]  know but why is he not going to support this and he said he says you know a lot
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:05.600]  about this he says you know a lot but he said you don't know at all and he said
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.080]  if you knew the rest of this story and if the public knew it would bring down
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:16.360]  this country as we know it and they said we keep oh and his message was to me
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:22.560]  keep doing what you're doing and don't stop and so all I can say is when you
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:25.320]  are aware of something when you're a whistleblower when you know something
[01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:31.360]  don't stop investigate it go find it go don't let go of it it is so incredibly
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:34.680]  important that we have people out there doing this on our side just like you were
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:41.720]  saying on the vaccine injury people get busy and get those videos made they should
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.160]  all be telling the story Joyce let me say this we're gonna come back for break
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:48.240]  and give you the total floor with David just guiding us and you know how to
[01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:52.560]  breaks here the power hour calm no matter what happens to you and I hope
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.880]  you get better and I'm praying for you know what you talk about your personal
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:58.920]  issues because people will obviously want to know about that if you don't mind but
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:02.360]  then also give us your take on world events no matter what happens your work
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:05.840]  fighting for the veterans and their families who also got ill from some of
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:10.280]  the communicable stuff that was transferred to them oh you a debt of
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:13.520]  gratitude and all the folks that have supported you or on the right side of
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:17.920]  history and God knows that you've done so much good and that's what matters our
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:23.520]  souls go on forever these bodies ashes to ashes dust to dust but and I pray and
[01:27:23.520 --> 01:27:27.960]  hope you live another 50 years but regardless you're a winner regardless
[01:27:27.960 --> 01:27:31.960]  you're one of the good guys we're in the white hat and I just want to salute you
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:36.160]  and thank you for all you've done so far and now your testimony and your
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:40.200]  testament is even stronger today so again I want to invite you up to the
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.680]  show again next week if you can do it or whenever but we're gonna go to break
[01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.360]  here in a few minutes but we've got a few minutes till then David will take us
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:51.400]  out please continue breaking down just the epic battles you've been through
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.840]  which I I know you'll say actually made you stronger that's the thing we're
[01:27:54.840 --> 01:28:01.000]  meant to do this and these forces of evil do things that are so big so evil so
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.840]  bad they then think that we can't accept how bad it is so they can keep getting
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.800]  away with it and it exponentially gets bigger and gets worse and we're building
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:15.360]  towards this event horizon now with the vaccines hurting so many people and so
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:19.680]  many people getting MS and other type diseases it's just incredible so Joyce
[01:28:19.680 --> 01:28:25.560]  please continue well I think that the average I think that the government
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:31.280]  thinks the bad guys the people that are trying to keep this ruse from us don't
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:34.980]  think that we're going to follow it and and stay with it they think they can
[01:28:34.980 --> 01:28:39.760]  intimidate us and that's what happened to me many times I got a call from the
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:46.280]  Department of Defense one day from captain chocker brown was his name
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:52.320]  captain chocker brown called me and he said captain Riley he said this is
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:55.760]  captain chocker brown from the Pentagon Navy captain he outranked me
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:01.800]  considerably and he said I want you to know that you are not to give out that
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:07.280]  documentary to anyone in the military and I said pardon and I said what is
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:12.520]  inaccurate in it and he said it's not that he said it's that you are one of
[01:29:12.520 --> 01:29:17.400]  us and I said no sir if you think I am going to participate in the wholesale
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:21.200]  manslaughter of our military you're wrong and I don't think he expected that
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:26.760]  and that's why I think we have to stand and then we have to stand and we don't
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:32.600]  they'll win absolutely it's so important to have the integrity to speak out when
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:37.040]  you see evil being done to other people and understand that you're part of the
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:40.200]  human race you're not just part of some government organization we've been
[01:29:40.200 --> 01:29:43.640]  talking to Joyce Riley she's going to continue with us after the break Joyce

[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:26.600]  show I'm David Knight and joining me for the rest of this hour is Joyce Riley of
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:32.480]  the power hour now of course Joyce is a talk show host another GCN show that is
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:37.960]  the power hour she's also a registered nurse a whistleblower about what
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:41.240]  happened during the Gulf War I found it very interesting Joyce when you were
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:47.600]  talking in the last hour last half hour to Alex mentioning the fact that you
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:50.680]  were not somebody who was on the battlefield yet you were experiencing
[01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:56.280]  these symptoms you believe from having to take 10 vaccines in a single day you
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:02.200]  believe that there was a very strong aspect of the multiple vaccines that
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:06.160]  that people were given all at once so that was a key part of this Gulf War
[01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:11.320]  syndrome and you also came across some research that exposed that and the people
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:15.680]  in politics who basically pull back and disown that won't talk about it won't
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:19.440]  address the evil it's just left to people who have the kind of integrity
[01:34:19.440 --> 01:34:24.520]  that you have Joyce who will continue to talk about this because it can't go away
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:28.120]  people need to know the truth this is this is very important that people speak
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.440]  out when they see this happen that's why your efforts as a whistleblower are
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:36.440]  very very important and your determination to keep talking about this
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:40.280]  and to not shut up I'm I remember Michelle Bachman everybody saying she
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:44.000]  jumped the shark when she talked about Rick Perry's trying to get mandatory
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.160]  vaccines on Texas school children she questioned the safety and efficacy and
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:54.120]  that was it the GOP was done with her she had ended her political career and
[01:34:54.120 --> 01:35:00.000]  you were essentially told to shut up but you didn't shut up you kept going well
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:03.960]  I don't think you can shut up when you see so many people ill like I did I
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:08.480]  started getting letters after I was on coast-to-coast from thousands and I do
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:12.800]  mean thousands I've still got lots of those letters filed away of people that
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:15.480]  were sick that were having the same problem being told there's nothing
[01:35:15.480 --> 01:35:20.200]  wrong with you or you have a mental problem and and it got to be so
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:25.720]  ridiculous that the government just kept lying and lying and these these men it
[01:35:25.720 --> 01:35:33.800]  forced them into these incredibly I don't know bizarre situations where they
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:38.480]  couldn't they couldn't remedy this situation they couldn't make sense of
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:41.480]  it because here they serve their country all their lives and all they were
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:45.880]  told was obey and do the take orders and you'll be taken care of and all that and
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:48.440]  then all of a sudden they get sick and they're told well you got a mental
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:53.480]  problem I mean they couldn't make any kind of sense of all of this and and
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:57.840]  that's what we had a problem with also was you know I mean my idea of the
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:01.840]  military my father used to he was a belly gun around a b-17 and he used to
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:05.360]  play off we go into the wild blue yonder you know every night before he went to
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:09.160]  bed and I mean we were just that was patriotism to us that was love of
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:15.480]  country and so when I saw these veterans so messed up and then placed on
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:19.760]  psychotropic drugs so here comes the next part of that is they're vaccinated to
[01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:24.400]  to the hilt given experimental drugs people know they're getting sick and
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:27.680]  know that it has something to do with the military and so then they place them
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:31.920]  on SSRI drugs to get him to be quiet so they can label them and say oh well
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:37.000]  look he's on these drugs so he must be a mental problem well which came first you
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  know the drugs are the mental problem and it was probably the drugs that came
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:46.200]  first and so I saw this taking place and then there there's one document
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:53.360]  Senate report 103-900 Senate report 103-900 you can go to go for vets.com
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:57.880]  and see a lot of these documents we've got them there online and it will change
[01:36:57.880 --> 01:37:03.240]  your life when you see what the government did know in 1994 the
[01:37:03.240 --> 01:37:08.360]  information they knew in 1994 and the people that knew it and if you were to
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:14.400]  read the list it's a who's who of who is in the Senate it was Paul Sarbanes Chris
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:20.080]  Dodd Jim Sasser Richard Shelby John Kerry who knew all this information Barbara
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:24.280]  Boxer Ben Nighthorse Campbell it goes on and on Patty Murray and they all knew
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:28.680]  this and they knew that these people were dying for these reasons and the
[01:37:28.680 --> 01:37:32.560]  veterans kept trying to say why don't you take care of us what's we know why
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:36.800]  why they couldn't make sense of it a lot of them committed suicide a lot of them
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:42.400]  couldn't take the abandonment and and let me give you an example of the way
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:47.040]  they tried to make you feel like you are mentally incompetent there was one man
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:51.880]  that I followed for a long time and he called me telling me that you know they
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:57.080]  are just writing me off and I'm a I've been I'm enlisted or non-com and I've
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:01.880]  been in for 27 years in the military and he said and they won't take care of me
[01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:06.200]  I mean that's a lot of seniority not to take care of your people and he said that
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:10.800]  I'm gonna be going over to the VA one last time he said because now I am in a
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:15.360]  wheelchair I cannot walk so now they're going to have to listen to me he said my
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:18.960]  wife is gonna take me over there and and our children are going to go over there
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:23.440]  and we're going to get an answer today regardless and I said oh great call me
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:27.400]  after you go to the meeting with them and let me know so he goes over there and
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:32.760]  he tells them he says I'm in a wheelchair now now will you guys believe me that I
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:38.800]  am sick and I don't have a mental problem and the doctor told the wife just
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:42.280]  went over to the wife and said look I hate to have to tell you this but we
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:46.240]  gave your husband a psych of Al which by the way they gave everybody a psych of
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:50.920]  Al first a psych evaluation first before they did anything so they could always
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:55.440]  say well here is the fallback reason why they're sick they could find something
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:02.160]  on anybody's psych of Al and he said to him he said to the wife he said I just
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:05.720]  need to tell you this we did a psych of Al of your house your husband and we
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:11.560]  think he is we think he is a latent homosexual and that's why he's doing
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:16.600]  this to himself and she got so mad at him she grabbed the physician's white
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.160]  jacket and of course they kicked her out and kicked them out and it was a major
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:25.920]  issue but she said how dare you say that to my husband in front of his family you
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:31.080]  know that's not true you know that is so far from being true and that's they
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:35.120]  would stop at nothing to try and convince these people they had a mental
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:39.600]  problem or to embarrass them or humiliate them or whatever and it all stems
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:43.720]  doesn't it Joyce from not getting informed consent in other words they've
[01:39:43.720 --> 01:39:47.920]  betrayed the trust and the submission that the soldiers gave them
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:52.560]  experimenting on them for the sake of big pharmaceutical companies and it
[01:39:52.560 --> 01:39:58.520]  strikes me how similar this is to let's say Tuskegee or to the things that we
[01:39:58.520 --> 01:40:03.640]  tried to enact the Nuremberg Code for to try to say that the goal standard of
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:08.880]  medical care is first of all you do no harm secondly you have informed consent
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:11.680]  of your patients because the soldiers didn't know they were being
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:15.920]  experimented on. Of course so right I'm glad you brought that up because by the
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:19.680]  way the Tuskegee Institute I studied that very carefully guess where that was
[01:40:19.680 --> 01:40:25.400]  held that was done at the Tuskegee VA now that's how integral this thing is
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:31.640]  into the military. I want to I want to share with you a document 103-97 this
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:37.720]  was worth seeing Senate Report 103-97 this was by the way is no longer
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:42.120]  available in fact it was never available only to committee members and I got a
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:48.280]  copy sent to me as did Dr. Stan Monteith at the time and let me quote to you
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:52.400]  from Senate Report 103-97 what you're talking about with informed consent I
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:58.200]  quote during the past 50 years hundreds of thousands of our military have been
[01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:03.880]  experimented upon without their knowledge or consent that's a quote right
[01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:09.880]  out of the document itself Senate Report 103-97 and they know it and they're
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:13.880]  continuing to do it but what about the compensation for all these people what
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:17.800]  about going back and finding out how many of them are sick dying whatever
[01:41:17.800 --> 01:41:23.600]  from whatever experiment they had more than 50% of the military is
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.760]  experimented upon so when you join the military know that and you know we give
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:31.880]  a copy of Beyond Treason to anybody that's thinking about joining the
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:38.080]  military just call the power hour if you or go to thepowerhour.com if you feel
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:42.200]  like you know if you're questioning joining the military please get this
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:45.360]  documentary we'll send it to you free because I want people to see what
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:50.320]  they're about to enter into because it's out of your hands and I don't care
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:54.080]  what the recruiter tells you he'll tell you oh yeah you can sign a waiver and
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:58.920]  you don't have to take the vaccines that is so far there has never been a waiver
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:05.360]  in the military ever and it's not just you're a nurse as well as as a vet so
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:09.080]  you know that they intimidate health care workers and say you must take this
[01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:13.840]  vaccine you must take that vaccine and on so many of these cases just as we were
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:18.280]  we were talked last week to Dr. Jane Orient who's an MD with American
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:23.040]  Association of Physicians and Surgeons they tried to get a FOIA request from
[01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:27.880]  the CDC saying show us the studies that you've done about the safety about the
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:33.240]  efficacy what are the conflicts of interest between the CDC and pharmaceutical
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:37.320]  companies are have you done any determination of that any kind of
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:41.160]  information like that that would give us information so that we could then
[01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:44.920]  have informed consent that is withheld that's covered up and we're not allowed
[01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:48.840]  to know that yet they intimidate people if you want this job as a health care
[01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:52.320]  worker and of course by that time you got so much invested you've gone to
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:57.600]  school to learn this as a RN or as a doctor you don't want to just walk away
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:43:00.520]  from your career so it's a huge factor there and of course they're doing the
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:05.160]  same thing even to parents and their children setting up a mandatory vaccine
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:08.500]  schedule so that you can get into school so if you want to work as a health care
[01:43:08.500 --> 01:43:11.800]  worker if you want to get into school if you want to be in the military they do
[01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:15.320]  these things to intimidate you or in the case of the military since you can't
[01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:19.040]  just quit your job they force you to do it anyway and they don't tell you what's
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:23.560]  in there right or they can send you to prison I know a lot of people that spent
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:28.880]  time in prison for refusing vaccines also in the military but the idea though
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:33.600]  of that you know even the cancer that I believe may have something to do with
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:41.320]  that I believe I was told by an NIH doctor I was discussing my cancer with
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:45.000]  him and he said Joyce you have gotten some of the worst of the worst stuff he
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:47.920]  said there's just no two ways about it I know what they were doing over there
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:53.080]  and I know what you've gotten and he said there may not be any answer for you
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:59.640]  and it is true you know if you go back and look at the SV 40 in 1959 people
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:04.560]  always believe that the government would do no harm they had the semianvirus 40
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:10.640]  cancer cells in the polio vaccine and gave it to all the people and then when
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:15.560]  they found out that it had semianvirus 40 cancer cells in it they went ahead and
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:22.000]  continued yeah absolutely oh so we've looked at there was a case coming out
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.240]  in North Carolina just before I came here to info wars where they were doing
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:30.280]  testing on people at the University of North Carolina the EPA was looking to
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:33.560]  increase its regulations on fine particulate matter and they were literally
[01:44:33.560 --> 01:44:38.920]  hooking people up to the tailpipes of diesel engines and trying to provoke a
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:42.800]  response they were screening for people who had heart issues or had respiratory
[01:44:42.800 --> 01:44:47.080]  issues they were trying to provoke a response they had the director of the
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:50.960]  EPA Lisa Jackson at the time was before Congress and saying we have more people
[01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:54.800]  dying from fine particulate matter than we do from cancer so they're hyping this
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:00.360]  and yet at the same time they're giving these people who signed up for this 70
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:05.320]  times the dosage that the EPA said would be fatal she was very emphatic she
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:09.000]  said I'm not talking about making people sick I'm talking about killing them we
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.400]  tried to stop that we tried to get a restraining order the courts turned it
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:17.680]  down the medical association in North Carolina was not interested in medical
[01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:21.720]  ethics the university was not interested in medical ethics the EPA is
[01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:25.240]  continuing to do this they then moved to California did it to children in
[01:45:25.240 --> 01:45:30.200]  California now they're back in North Carolina looking for black teenagers who
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:33.940]  have respiratory issues so they can make them sick so they can grow their
[01:45:33.940 --> 01:45:39.160]  empire I don't think that their current levels are as high and have the kind of
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:43.360]  effects that they say but the idea that they can do these experiments without
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:46.240]  informed consent and of course under the Nuremberg Code the point we were
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:49.560]  making was under the Nuremberg Code you cannot give informed consent for
[01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:54.120]  something that would kill you that's not even allowed so we have this
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:58.000]  systemically throughout the government it's being done to people in the medical
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:00.760]  profession is being done to people in the military it's being done to our
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:06.480]  children and it's being done in human testing by our bureaucratic agencies oh
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:13.120]  yeah and a lot of testing that we don't know about on things that and places that
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:18.160]  we are not aware of they did a lot of testing in the biological testing in the
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:22.520]  Department of Defense without our knowledge but you know and when we
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:27.520]  have had enough and say that's it or there are some there's some
[01:46:27.520 --> 01:46:30.560]  accountability for that and these people all spend the rest of their natural
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:34.360]  lives in prison I thought it would be the Gulf War by the way the way that they
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:39.400]  were able to keep people from thinking that Gulf War veterans was sick is that
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:44.760]  this is the MO of the military or any government organization is they will go
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:49.920]  to somebody like the Rand Corporation or oh what is the name of the other one the
[01:46:49.920 --> 01:46:55.520]  Rand Corporation and can't think of the other one right now but anyway they
[01:46:55.520 --> 01:47:01.240]  would go to these organizations and pay them a huge amount of money to basically
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:05.920]  find out that there is no that they have no position on it and that's what they
[01:47:05.920 --> 01:47:09.360]  would do and they would pay Rand Corporation I forget how many millions of
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:13.280]  dollars to come back and say we don't find any evidence to support there is a
[01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:17.560]  Gulf War illness well my goodness evidence you've got you know a hundred
[01:47:17.560 --> 01:47:20.680]  thousand people that are sick that weren't sick before the Gulf War you've
[01:47:20.680 --> 01:47:25.120]  got all kinds of evidence but that's what they would do and if the Rand
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:29.880]  Corporation said that or then they were able to say well we went to the Rand
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:33.680]  Corporation we trust them they're an independent organization and they said
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:37.560]  there's nothing wrong so therefore and everybody buys into that for the next
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:41.000]  five years so the government uses a private corporation to give them
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:46.040]  plausible deniability just as the private pharmaceutical companies use the
[01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:50.880]  government either the FDA or other agencies to give them plausible
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:55.040]  deniability to give them a legal cover we've seen this happen many times one
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:48:00.520]  of the things that Dr. Orient was talking about was how the CDC had approved
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:06.280]  the rotovirus vaccine and they had to withdraw that after a year of approval
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:09.480]  because it was so bad and we see this over and over again with flawed or
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:13.760]  incomplete clinical trials when they were looking at the effects of GMO on
[01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:18.280]  rats remember those pictures of the rats that had the massive tumors coming out
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:21.160]  of France and of course Monsanto said that's not correct we did our own
[01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:24.880]  studies and they didn't develop any tumors Monsanto did a very very very
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:29.360]  short study versus one that went a little bit longer with the French and
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:33.600]  gave time for the tumors to manifest themselves to be to show up so you can
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:38.920]  rig these studies any way that you want that's why it's important for informed
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:43.280]  consent that the CDC and the FDA and these other companies put the studies
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:47.000]  out there for the public to take a look at it for the medical community to take
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:53.080]  a look at it I remember going back to the swine flu thing back in the 1970s
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:57.520]  there was a clip when 60 minutes looked at it Joyce and they had Mike Wallace
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:02.440]  talking to the head of the CDC at that time about all the celebrity endorsements
[01:49:02.440 --> 01:49:06.520]  and he said yeah we held the celebrity or so one of them was Mary Tyler Moore and
[01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:10.520]  they went back to her after this debacle because a lot of people got
[01:49:10.520 --> 01:49:15.760]  Guillain-Barre syndrome from from the swine flu vaccines that they pretty
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:20.080]  much scared the public into taking and she said yeah my doctor was all for it I
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:23.560]  was skeptical of it I didn't do it and he goes how does your doctor feel today
[01:49:23.560 --> 01:49:28.600]  and she's he's very happy that I didn't do that very happy thought that I made
[01:49:28.600 --> 01:49:31.880]  the right decision so even the doctors don't have all that information when
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:36.760]  they're talking to their patients well you know we're talking about a government
[01:49:36.760 --> 01:49:42.160]  that has gotten too big too too controlling that we need to do something
[01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:46.320]  about because that's how all of this illegal activity is able to be done
[01:49:46.320 --> 01:49:50.560]  they have to have a VA hospital for instance there has to be the VA
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:54.800]  bureaucracy it doesn't work it's not effective but they have to have it
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:57.760]  because if you're gonna look at all the experiments that were done in the
[01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:03.800]  military and brought forward you've got to have a place that you can follow
[01:50:03.800 --> 01:50:07.840]  those experiments and the VA is where you do it that's why they don't go to
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:12.160]  tricare or that's why they don't have another system is because you have to
[01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:16.840]  keep quiet the experiments so they can follow them year to year and decade to
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:23.680]  decade an example BZ a drug that is a hallucinogenic drug was given to the
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:29.240]  Vietnam veterans during the course of Vietnam War and the military BZ is a
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:34.760]  hallucinogenic drug that's much worse than LSD they gave it to half of the unit
[01:50:34.760 --> 01:50:39.400]  and they wanted to see if that unit would kill that half of unit would kill
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:43.640]  the other half of the unit that didn't get the drug absolutely hang on we got
[01:50:43.640 --> 01:50:47.320]  to take a break yeah you're talking about LSD there's an amazing book a
[01:50:47.320 --> 01:50:51.200]  terrible mistake that talks about the early days of the biological and

[01:54:11.320 --> 01:54:16.800]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight I'm talking to Joyce Riley
[01:54:16.800 --> 01:54:21.320]  from the power hour another show that's on GCN we've been talking to her about
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:27.880]  her experiences as a nurse as a veteran as a whistleblower about Gulf War syndrome
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:32.160]  and of course the website that she has a lot of information about documents that
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:36.440]  she found out about the Gulf War syndrome is at Gulf War calm one of the
[01:54:36.440 --> 01:54:41.720]  things that Joyce was saying was that even as a nurse she didn't really take
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:46.160]  her health that seriously didn't think about nutritional side of things really
[01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:50.720]  kind of taking a respond to the disease when it happens and I got to say that's
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:54.440]  the way I've pretty much been pretty much all of my life as well the only time
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:54:59.360]  I ever did something different to that was when my sister got cancer we tried
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:03.200]  to do a macrobotic diet with her and we stuck to that for several years the best
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.480]  I ever felt in my life but you have to take care of yourself one of the things
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:10.840]  that we did mention this hour of course are the specials that will help you to
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:14.280]  do that info wars life calm helps to support our operation as well we now
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:18.360]  have 20% off super male and super female vitality for the month of February
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:23.320]  you'll find 15% off propure water filters and we have a special where you
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:28.640]  can buy two survival shield x2 and get one ancient defense for free and Joyce
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:33.560]  as we were going out that that's one of the things that I think people need to
[01:55:33.560 --> 01:55:37.720]  take the heart and that is to not only do your research about things that may
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:41.560]  harm you but do you research about things that can actually help you help
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:46.320]  your your immune system give you a better health and to look at what you're
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:50.040]  eating because when I look at the the Amish and how they've got such a low
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:54.240]  incidence of autism there's a full spectrum of things that they're not
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:55:58.520]  doing that we're doing and things that we're not doing that they are doing is
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:02.560]  a very different lifestyle that we live in modern America and we're paying the
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:06.120]  price for it and increased cancer and autism and so many of these different
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:11.040]  diseases aren't we oh without a doubt without a doubt you know we create those
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:14.640]  diseases in our bodies now there's a lot of things we can't do anything about
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:18.840]  but there are a lot of things that we can change and you know pure water pure
[01:56:18.840 --> 01:56:24.720]  oxygen as much as possible and then organic food but what we're seeing now
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:30.320]  is let me just give you an example from the Gulf War now there were 697,000
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:37.040]  troops that served in the Gulf War there were only 140 that died during the
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:46.440]  Gulf War of the US troops and of those 70 were friendly fire so we only lost
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:53.000]  70 some people in the Gulf War in a whole entire war but we have lost now of
[01:56:53.000 --> 01:56:59.440]  about 400,000 that have become ill and died as a result of the Gulf War now why
[01:56:59.440 --> 01:57:03.600]  isn't anybody asking any questions like why are 400,000 people dead and gone and
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:11.080]  why is it that the Department of Defense is the biggest user of SSRI drugs in
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:17.760]  the in the world the the Department of Defense buys more SSRI drugs than
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:22.720]  anybody I mean this is sick this is just sick stuff and so now we're
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:25.640]  medicating these people to the hilt and then they're dying in their sleep or
[01:57:25.640 --> 01:57:30.120]  they're dying from suicides or homicides absolutely you know it's so
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:33.720]  interesting to think about that you could actually go to a war and look at
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:39.780]  how much lower the risk is to you of dying in that war than the chemicals the
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:44.080]  vaccines the all these drugs that are coming from the pharmaceutical companies
[01:57:44.080 --> 01:57:49.280]  and that's what's happening to us as a people we see not only the increases in
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:54.800]  diseases like cancer but we also see the decreased fertility rates I remember it
[01:57:54.800 --> 01:57:58.560]  was just last week that they were talking about Italy being a dying nation
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:01.800]  because their birth rates were so low but the thing I thought was interesting
[01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:05.640]  Joyce is so many times will portray that as being a lifestyle decision that
[01:58:05.640 --> 01:58:09.160]  people have made saying that well they just want to have the lady wants to
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:12.720]  have a career they delay having children but it turned out in this case it was
[01:58:12.720 --> 01:58:17.640]  lower for immigrants that was down below two for immigrants so I think it's
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:20.760]  something environmental as well going on there do you want to stay through to

[02:00:34.640 --> 02:00:39.640]  rest of this hour if you want to call in and comment on what you've heard as we
[02:00:39.640 --> 02:00:45.680]  talked to Joyce Riley from the power hour that number is 800-259-9231 of
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:51.280]  course we were talking to Joyce about her experience as a nurse as a veteran
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:56.800]  what she saw happening to veterans without their informed consent this is
[02:00:56.800 --> 02:01:02.760]  the thing that should concern us so much as we see the scared clamor to remove
[02:01:02.760 --> 02:01:07.560]  informed consent as we see the media that is making fortunes off of the
[02:01:07.560 --> 02:01:12.480]  advertisements of the big pharmaceutical companies pushing mandatory vaccines
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:19.120]  just as they pushed mandatory health insurance on us during Obamacare no we
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:24.400]  should have the choice these are people and most of these cases these are people
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:27.880]  who the only choice they want you to have is whether or not you're going to
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:33.040]  kill your unborn child but everything else in life you don't get a choice you
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:37.320]  don't get a say you have to have the government mandate to you so we have the
[02:01:37.320 --> 02:01:42.120]  LA Times bragging about the governor and the California Legislature
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:47.440]  presumably moving to stop the personal belief exemption that's the way they've
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:53.720]  rebranded informed consent let me explain to you with the Constitution we have the
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:58.800]  legitimate governments derive their justified powers from the consent of
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:03.400]  the governed but no longer no longer do they tell us what they're doing no
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:08.560]  longer do they even pretend to care if they have our consent and it's not just
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:12.080]  simple things that they ignore our consent on it's not just whether they're
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:17.600]  going to anything that they want to do no matter how small it is even at the
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:21.880]  local level everything is hidden from us they don't want us to know anything
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:27.000]  that they're doing this is an article that was just handed to me from Nico and
[02:02:27.000 --> 02:02:30.600]  he said the it's entitled the FDA is hiding scientific fraud and you should
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:34.480]  be upset about it that's not actually what they said this article but they
[02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:39.120]  point out that when the FDA encounters instances of scientific misconduct it
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:42.600]  buries the evidence and they point out that according to the Journal of
[02:02:42.600 --> 02:02:48.160]  American Medical Association's JAMA they said in an investigation of the FDA they
[02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:52.320]  said what they found were falsification or submission of false information
[02:02:52.320 --> 02:02:57.840]  problems with adverse events reporting protocol violations inadequate or
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:02.220]  inaccurate record keeping failure to protect the safety of patients and or
[02:03:02.220 --> 02:03:08.360]  issues with oversight or informed consent etc etc etc but we're supposed to
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:12.040]  just shut up and take the vaccine that's what we're told by the doctor on
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:17.400]  CNN the same one who when her film crew was exposed to Ebola violated the
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:23.240]  quarantine that she should have respected as a doctor we're told that we
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:29.380]  should that our children are the ones who are responsible for these this break
[02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:35.080]  outbreak of measles by this lady in Canada and yet the person that
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:39.680]  possibly exposed her son was someone who had been vaccinated there's an
[02:03:39.680 --> 02:03:44.720]  interesting story this up on natural news about another measles outbreak I've
[02:03:44.720 --> 02:03:49.160]  talked many times about the one in 2011 in New York that began where patient zero
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:54.120]  was a twice vaccinated woman who passed it on to four other people two of whom
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:58.040]  had records that they had been twice vaccinated the other two had signs in
[02:03:58.040 --> 02:04:01.520]  their blood that they had been vaccinated and natural news they point out
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:06.120]  that in 1987 there was a study released about an outbreak in Corpus Christi two
[02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:11.360]  years earlier in 1985 14 adolescent age students all of whom had been
[02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:18.280]  vaccinated for measles contracted the disease we point out that 99% of the
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:23.840]  students at the school basically all of them had been vaccinated yet they're
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:30.240]  getting the disease so much for the idea of herd immunity no it is really just a
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:35.920]  herd mentality and what they're trying to do is call the herd as you just heard
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:42.520]  from Joyce so few people died in actual combat during the Gulf War and yet over
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:48.240]  400,000 are dying of Gulf War syndrome and other complications giving people
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:52.960]  massive amounts of vaccines all at once without their consent and certainly

[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:22.640]  alex jones show I'm david night your host for the rest of the show
[02:08:22.640 --> 02:08:27.120]  we were just talking in the last hour to Joyce Riley of the power hour another
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:34.280]  GCN radio program she is struggling with stage 4 cancer that's metastatic cancer
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:39.200]  appeared in multiple places in her body she would very much covet your prayers
[02:08:39.200 --> 02:08:45.360]  as a Christian and she exposed as she was talking about it she has made a very
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:51.440]  valiant effort to expose what happened to people in the military the huge toll
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:55.840]  that was taken on the military not by fighting the war but by the vaccines
[02:08:55.840 --> 02:08:59.440]  that were given to them without their informed consent she has a website about
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:04.520]  that Gulf war vets calm there you can see the documents that she's been able to
[02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:09.200]  unearth as a whistleblower as a reporter over a long period of time you need
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:13.680]  to understand what our government does what it is capable of what the
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:18.760]  pharmaceutical companies that control these politicians is capable of you
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:24.560]  need to understand that before you give them your blind faith before you destroy
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:30.800]  the notion of individual informed consent and continue to push for this kind of
[02:09:30.800 --> 02:09:35.680]  herd immunization which doesn't work if you don't have something that works for
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:39.240]  an individual it isn't going to work for the herd and as I just pointed out you
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:43.240]  had an incident in corpus Christi where all the kids 99% of them were
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:49.280]  vaccinated and yet all 14 had that came down with measles had been vaccinated so
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:53.720]  much for the idea of herd mentality you also pointed out in this article that
[02:09:53.720 --> 02:09:59.760]  back in the mid 80s half of the kids I think it was 1987 let me check that I
[02:09:59.760 --> 02:10:08.240]  think it was 1988 report from the CDC listed that of 3,655 cases of
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:16.160]  measles and 1987 1903 in other words 52% of the cases of measles according to
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:23.400]  the CDC and 1987 52% of the cases were people who had been vaccinated tell me
[02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:29.440]  that it is effective and let's also talk about the safety because the first rule
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:34.920]  of medical ethics should be first do no harm so first we talk about the safety
[02:10:34.920 --> 02:10:38.800]  then you can tell me if you think you've got something that's effective I want to
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:43.600]  see the studies show me the information you will not get my consent before you
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:46.960]  show me the information but the very dangerous thing that we have now is that
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:51.600]  no longer do we have governments who think that they need to govern by the
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:56.400]  consent of the people they don't even need our consent to do horrible things
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:59.800]  to us as individuals we've got a lot of people have called in to talk about this
[02:10:59.800 --> 02:11:03.600]  many of them Gulf War vets themselves I want them to have a chance to talk let's
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:12.680]  go directly to Ron in Tennessee Ron afternoon David hi I'm both a Vietnam
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:19.200]  veteran and a Gulf War veteran excuse me just moment bad weather here in Tennessee
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:27.120]  I'm playing I can testify that what Joyce says is true and by the way on that
[02:11:27.120 --> 02:11:34.960]  out agent BZ they gave it to a team of Army Rangers if memory serves me correct
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:42.840]  it doesn't always that was at the CIA compound north of Saigon in 1968 I
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:48.080]  believe and the name of the operation was operation Jacob's ladder they all
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:54.560]  killed each other wow after they dropped them off you can look that up I'm sure
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:59.680]  there's some and that came out during the Senate investigation on the Central
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:07.520]  Intelligence Agency by Senator Frank Church in 1975 like Joyce I have had a
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:14.480]  lot of physical problems I went I was in the Navy I went to the I call it
[02:12:14.480 --> 02:12:20.160]  wisdom of Navy in a wisdom of medicine in the Navy I'm being sarcastic of course
[02:12:20.160 --> 02:12:25.200]  they didn't have an answer for anything and they always did what doctors always
[02:12:25.200 --> 02:12:30.160]  do when you hit them with something they don't know about they said oh it's all
[02:12:30.160 --> 02:12:39.040]  your fault you did this to yourself and anyway I had to keep plugging at this
[02:12:39.040 --> 02:12:44.920]  and it took me 13 years to get properly rated dealing with the veterans
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:52.160]  administration so all you vets out there that you're going after the VA don't let
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:57.720]  them herd you into an appeals court and keep it in writing and keep coming at
[02:12:57.720 --> 02:13:02.160]  them each year year after year it takes time but you'll win if you keep it up
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:08.400]  we've had we've even had it yes thank you Ron thank you so much we've even had a
[02:13:08.400 --> 02:13:13.920]  vet come in here who was on the USS Reagan who they that was the ship that
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:18.680]  responded to the Fukushima incident and of course even though it was very well
[02:13:18.680 --> 02:13:23.040]  known that these guys were exposed to radioactive water as many of them were
[02:13:23.040 --> 02:13:27.000]  coming down sick of course the VA just basically turned their back on them and
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:31.600]  did not treat them so even in something that is is that obvious and of course what
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:38.320]  Joyce is talking about here was a vaccination she believes that she has the
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:42.440]  same symptoms that these that the part of the Gulf War syndrome she was not on
[02:13:42.440 --> 02:13:48.240]  the battlefield but she was given a huge massive number of vaccines on the same
[02:13:48.240 --> 02:13:53.560]  day as were the soldiers so perhaps that is the common link again her website is
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:56.800]  GulfWarVets.com if you want to get information about that let's go on to
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:14:02.840]  Gerald in Arkansas Gerald go ahead Dave can you hear me yes go ahead you're
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:09.680]  live yes look I'm a I served under John F. Kennedy and I got out right before the
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:14.400]  Vietnam thing escalated so I thank God for that but my heart goes out to all
[02:14:14.400 --> 02:14:20.760]  these veterans since then and I was telling the call screener back in 1945
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:25.480]  John Wayne was in a movie called they were expendable is about PT boat
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:31.480]  commanders as we know GFK was one of those but the point is is that Eisenhower
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:36.080]  warned about the military industrial complex Kennedy did also and nobody no
[02:14:36.080 --> 02:14:41.240]  president since then has been warning about that it's about the bankers and
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:47.240]  the Pentagon making money going to war using the soldiers as guinea pigs and
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:51.600]  the drug companies have been using the American public in the world but
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:57.080]  American public is guinea pigs so so we're all expendable to them we're just
[02:14:57.080 --> 02:15:01.880]  guinea pigs to be used and then discarded and oh absolutely look at
[02:15:01.880 --> 02:15:05.960]  Smedley Butler who was talking about that who said that he had gone to war
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:10.940]  after war for at that time it was the United Fruit Company they were the big
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:14.760]  multinational corporation that everybody was going to war for but he
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:17.800]  pointed that out and he stood with the veterans who were trying to get their
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:21.600]  benefits that had been promised to them by the United States government as the
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:24.600]  depression came on they desperately needed those benefits many of them
[02:15:24.600 --> 02:15:29.120]  want marched on Washington and of course they were brutally treated by
[02:15:29.120 --> 02:15:33.560]  general MacArthur and Eisenhower at the same time but Eisenhower was warning us
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:39.560]  not only of just the military and the people who are making the machines that
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:44.200]  and the bombs and the weapons but he was also warning us that the research
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:48.800]  institutions would be totally captivated by the military industrial complex I
[02:15:48.800 --> 02:15:54.040]  just saw an article this weekend about a contact lens that was being developed
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:58.120]  where you could basically wink with one eye and it would essentially telescope in
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:02.920]  for people who had age-related macular degeneration it would zoom you in
[02:16:02.920 --> 02:16:09.240]  essentially so you could see better you lose the sight right at the center of
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:14.860]  your vision with AMD and guess who funded it it was funded by DARPA because
[02:16:14.860 --> 02:16:21.160]  DARPA is looking for supervision they essentially own all of the research now
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:24.400]  at this point the government but especially the military industrial
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:29.160]  complex is funding virtually all of the research and we see them using it for
[02:16:29.160 --> 02:16:35.280]  things like killer robots we now have tanks that are going to be worried
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:38.320]  about the m-wraps that they're giving to the local law enforcement well they
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:43.800]  are creating tanks that would operate autonomously killer tanks that are
[02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:47.320]  going to make their own decisions this is the kind of nightmare scenario that
[02:16:47.320 --> 02:16:52.760]  DARPA is coming up with and at the same time they have absolute contempt for the
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:56.320]  people that have joined to serve them was there something else you want to say
[02:16:56.320 --> 02:17:02.160]  Gerald I just gonna say that the whole what enables him to do all this up is
[02:17:02.160 --> 02:17:07.200]  the Pony Federal Reserve the odd money system yes without that they couldn't do
[02:17:07.200 --> 02:17:11.320]  any of this yes absolutely and you know what the first order of business was
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:15.240]  when they came back from the election the first order of business was to
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:19.200]  extend insurance to the bankers derivatives because I think they're
[02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:23.520]  getting kind of concerned about the economy again and this shaky derivative
[02:17:23.520 --> 02:17:28.320]  situation that is far far larger than the mortgage derivatives that blew up on
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:33.720]  us in 2008 now we're on the tap for derivative market that is many many
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:38.560]  times larger than that mortgage market and that's something that I think this
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:44.280]  is the that's the key part of why they're getting us on a trigger triggers
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:48.240]  edge with these conflicts in the Ukraine and elsewhere they want to have many
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:52.240]  wars that are set up so that they can distract our attention from the people
[02:17:52.240 --> 02:17:56.160]  that we should really be angry about and that's as you pointed out the bankers
[02:17:56.160 --> 02:18:00.320]  who have ruined this economy and the politicians who've assisted them and it
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:06.360]  thank you so much sure let's go to a gatekeeper in Georgia gatekeeper yes
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:11.120]  David can you hear me okay yes go ahead all right first off I'm gonna say
[02:18:11.120 --> 02:18:15.800]  Joyce God bless you for continuing to do what you're doing because a lot of
[02:18:15.800 --> 02:18:19.520]  people would give up and just let the sickness get the best of them so God
[02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:26.560]  bless your spirit ma'am and David I'm 32 years old I've been listening to Alex
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:33.920]  it's about age 20 and I got a quick testimonial to give I take my son to a
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:41.000]  speech therapy once a week and there's a a poem up there it's got two kids with
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:45.640]  autism and I've just been trying to you know get the strength of the talk to
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:53.320]  her and I think it was last Wednesday finally talked to her and it ended up in
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:59.720]  tears you know as soon as we got there second round of shots she just started
[02:18:59.720 --> 02:19:05.400]  noticing a lot of changes in them and it was just a I can't believe I didn't talk
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:09.920]  to her before I did because I just want to encourage everyone but to get out
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:14.040]  there and because I was able to give her the information and I'm sure that
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:19.200]  she's already checked out Alex might be listening to the show well thank you
[02:19:19.200 --> 02:19:22.000]  for doing that and that's the thing that's really important for people to
[02:19:22.000 --> 02:19:27.920]  understand I know many people feel so guilt-ridden because they gave vaccines
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:32.080]  to their kids and didn't know about what was happening and they they don't want
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:37.280]  to acknowledge or to talk about what happened to their kids but you need to
[02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:41.680]  do that just because somebody took advantage of you is no reason not to
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:45.640]  speak out and to prevent them from taking advantage of other people it's very
[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:48.280]  important so we want to hear your testimonies thank you so much for

[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:21.760]  the show and we're taking phone calls about people's experiences with vaccines
[02:24:21.760 --> 02:24:28.280]  we talked to Joyce Riley in the last hour with a power hour that's her show on GCN
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:35.160]  and of course Joyce is struggling with stage 4 cancer she requests your prayers
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:41.160]  and she had a lot to say about what's behind the Gulf War syndrome about the
[02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:48.760]  tremendous cost and lives that have occurred not on the battlefield but in
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:56.080]  the hospitals where they injected people in her case 10 vaccinations in one day
[02:24:56.080 --> 02:25:01.120]  she traces a lot of health problems to that point and now she's struggling with
[02:25:01.120 --> 02:25:05.800]  cancer so keep her in your prayers and of course you can get information at
[02:25:05.800 --> 02:25:10.880]  gulfwarvets.com we're taking calls on vaccines and people's personal
[02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:19.920]  testimonies let's go to Dave and Long Island Dave hi David hi go ahead I want
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:23.720]  to talk about my daughter actually that has a rare disease that they attribute
[02:25:23.720 --> 02:25:29.120]  to genetics but as it turns out it it's different but first I want to say
[02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:36.320]  something about people and they're disconnect in the sense that people are
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:41.640]  so concerned about additives in their foods and canes of soup etc etc they're
[02:25:41.640 --> 02:25:46.040]  so concerned about additives in a purity of their food yet somehow they're not
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:52.880]  concerned about the purity of their vaccines very good we've had a lot
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:58.440]  of we've had a lot of progress I believe in getting people to question whether
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:01.360]  or not they need to have this food coloring whether or not they need to
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:07.520]  have that preservative in there making a few little extra dollars for the company
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:10.520]  is that really worth that preservative that they're putting in there to give it
[02:26:10.520 --> 02:26:13.800]  a little bit longer shelf life is that really worth the health risk to the
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:18.120]  people that consume that and I think the public is answering back no it is not
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:22.000]  worth it to us we'll be willing to pay a little bit more for cleaner food and
[02:26:22.000 --> 02:26:26.040]  that is essentially the same issue that we're seeing with the vaccines go ahead
[02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:31.440]  right so I mean and the point is to mean is the context is different also because
[02:26:31.440 --> 02:26:35.960]  the whole thing started out with the food with the pesticides being on the
[02:26:35.960 --> 02:26:40.680]  food a little hard to tell people that it kills that thing over there if it's on
[02:26:40.680 --> 02:26:45.480]  your food it's going to kill you too yes people understand that but we see with
[02:26:45.480 --> 02:26:51.360]  vaccines it's efficacious and like Alex says to he's not against vaccines per
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:56.480]  say he's against what they're putting in the vaccines you know what we just
[02:26:56.480 --> 02:27:00.480]  referred to with the food with the additives etc etc etc that's right it's
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:04.880]  a preservative that's going to kill bacteria but it's also these adjuvants
[02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:10.080]  that are designed to provoke an immune response and so when you multiply the
[02:27:10.080 --> 02:27:12.920]  number of vaccines that people are given when you give multiple vaccines at the
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:18.480]  same time you're really multiplying that aluminum that is there to provoke and to
[02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:22.200]  attack your immune system is it any wonder that people are having autoimmune
[02:27:22.200 --> 02:27:25.160]  disease problems that they're having autism that they're having so many other
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:29.280]  things when they get things that are designed to do that that's the that's
[02:27:29.280 --> 02:27:33.600]  the key issue I just wanted to point out that disconnect there people are so
[02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:37.560]  concerned about all the things they add to the foods and they want pure foods and
[02:27:37.560 --> 02:27:41.520]  blah blah blah yet with the vaccines hey whatever the guy in a lab coach says
[02:27:41.520 --> 02:27:46.400]  it's okay or whatever with with the new balance white sneakers on and his pen
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:52.040]  pocket protector or whatever and like oh no it couldn't be but my thing is my
[02:27:52.040 --> 02:27:57.440]  testimony is is about my daughter my daughter has a very rare disease that
[02:27:57.440 --> 02:28:01.720]  they say is genetic now 20 years ago when my daughter was born she's 20 years
[02:28:01.720 --> 02:28:06.880]  old now she seemed to be a normal baby to me I've been around a lot of babies she
[02:28:06.880 --> 02:28:11.680]  seemed perfectly fine okay after she got all the vaccines and all that kind of
[02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:15.560]  stuff that's when we noticed that there was some problem but not we didn't
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:19.960]  attribute it to the vaccines but at that time 20 years ago I think the
[02:28:19.960 --> 02:28:25.080]  questions was just starting to be raised about vaccines and autism so nobody
[02:28:25.080 --> 02:28:31.080]  really know because it was in its in its nascency okay but I suspected it and
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:37.360]  when I asked the doctor and you know he he he absolutely refuted it but the
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:42.040]  thing was is that I was bringing my daughter in to see him because she had a
[02:28:42.040 --> 02:28:45.680]  problem now he you know the pediatrician admitted that there was something
[02:28:45.680 --> 02:28:51.680]  wrong with my daughter but he could not identify it okay but yet without able to
[02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:58.480]  being able to identify what was wrong with her precisely he still insisted
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:03.840]  that vaccines were not the cause okay because he's been told by the CDC he's
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:07.200]  been told by the FDA that these drugs are have been tested they're safe and
[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:10.840]  effective they haven't in many cases looked at the studies themselves she
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:14.920]  was pointing out in the last hour when they did this with a swine flu the
[02:29:14.920 --> 02:29:19.080]  doctor was telling Mayor Tyler Moore yeah you should take this swine flu shot
[02:29:19.080 --> 02:29:23.320]  and then after all these people got sick they came back and he said I think you
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:27.840]  made the right decision the doctors are not necessarily even informed we haven't
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:31.800]  seen the research even if they've done the studies they're not publishing them
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:34.720]  hang on we'll come right back to you Dave I want to give you a chance to finish

[02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:30.240]  calls at 800-259-9231 we're talking about vaccines because there's a massive
[02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:36.840]  push on by the media as well as social networks to push against informed
[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:45.240]  consent mandatory vaccines strike at the very heart of medical ethics the core
[02:33:45.240 --> 02:33:51.640]  value of medical ethics is a first do no harm but also the Nuremberg code that
[02:33:51.640 --> 02:33:56.280]  came out of the abuses that we saw in the human experimentation by the Nazis
[02:33:56.280 --> 02:34:01.080]  by the Japanese who incidentally were brought to this country as part of
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:05.040]  operation paperclip very well documented in a book called a terrible
[02:34:05.040 --> 02:34:09.760]  mistake it's the story of Frank Olson someone who worked in the biological and
[02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:14.360]  chemical operations of the US government in the 1950s was part of the
[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:18.920]  lsd experiments and was someone who either was thrown out of a window or
[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:24.280]  jumped out of a window to his death it is a very very well documented book I
[02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:29.920]  would suggest that to anyone if you want to know the beginnings of the kind of
[02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:34.720]  criminal actions that we see in this country that are have taken to an
[02:34:34.720 --> 02:34:39.920]  extreme extent here as we now have people pushing against informed consent
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:45.200]  the very basis of the Nuremberg code of course when you bring in scientists that
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:49.080]  had been experimenting on people when you make them a part of the US government
[02:34:49.080 --> 02:34:54.800]  medical programs you should expect that you're going to see the same types of
[02:34:54.800 --> 02:34:59.720]  things done secretly to people whether it's troops or whether it's the Tuskegee
[02:34:59.720 --> 02:35:03.840]  experiments or things like that that we see going on at the EPA they have
[02:35:03.840 --> 02:35:09.400]  absolutely nothing but it contempt for our informed consent and that's a very
[02:35:09.400 --> 02:35:13.640]  dangerous proposition but our government is very dangerous when they're going to
[02:35:13.640 --> 02:35:19.200]  bring in scientists who should have gone to jail or been executed under the
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:23.920]  Nuremberg trials for violating human rights when they bring them in as
[02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:28.280]  government consultants create a program around it of course the one thing that I
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:32.720]  disagree with a book a terrible mistake about is that he says well this is about
[02:35:32.720 --> 02:35:38.320]  the dark days of the beginnings of the biological and chemical programs in the
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:41.480]  United States government let me tell you something it hasn't changed if
[02:35:41.480 --> 02:35:45.240]  anything it's gotten far worse because our government is far less
[02:35:45.240 --> 02:35:50.520]  transparent than it was 50 60 years ago still it's a great read it's very well
[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:54.560]  documented for what it covers even if he doesn't believe that's still going on
[02:35:54.560 --> 02:35:58.200]  we know that it's going on and the fact that it went on that where are the
[02:35:58.200 --> 02:36:02.200]  changes that would keep that from happening again our government has
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:07.760]  nothing but contempt for people who try to stop human experimentation as we saw
[02:36:07.760 --> 02:36:12.440]  with the EPA experiments as we see now with the push by the government by the
[02:36:12.440 --> 02:36:18.120]  media to wipe out informed consent that's the basis of our medical ethics but
[02:36:18.120 --> 02:36:21.360]  of course we can also talk about the safety and the efficacy of these things
[02:36:21.360 --> 02:36:24.040]  and that's what I want to take your phone calls about your personal
[02:36:24.040 --> 02:36:28.960]  experiences with this before we do I want to let you know that this hour the
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:32.800]  Alex Jones show is brought to you by the products that you'll find at info wars

[02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:11.400]  about the different risks as well as the benefits of things that you can find
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:15.320]  naturally. There was an interesting article I mentioned earlier in the show
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:19.360]  that NPR covered about the fight going on between the different plastics
[02:37:19.360 --> 02:37:23.280]  companies between the ones who sell products with BPA in it which are known
[02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:28.880]  to have estrogenic effects that plastic then there was a BPA free product that
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:34.720]  came out Triton and they got into back-and-forth lawsuits as well as
[02:37:34.720 --> 02:37:40.160]  conflicting scientific claims different scientific papers that's as it
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:43.680]  should be this should be out in the open for people to make their own decisions
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:47.640]  and as one of the fellows from one of these corporations said I think people
[02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:53.120]  are recognizing that it's not the courts that determine scientific questions
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:59.200]  that's right it's not up to a majority vote it's not up to the courts it should
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:03.560]  be open discussion we should be skeptical about what we're being told
[02:38:03.560 --> 02:38:08.360]  instead of saying just shut up the science is settled science is never
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:13.480]  settled if it is settled then what you're giving people is religious dogma
[02:38:13.480 --> 02:38:17.240]  you're not giving them science you always question the science you always
[02:38:17.240 --> 02:38:20.520]  test it you always go back and look at the results but of course they won't
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:24.120]  show us the results let's go back to Dave and Long Island Dave you're just
[02:38:24.120 --> 02:38:27.240]  getting ready to tell us about your daughter that they diagnosed with a
[02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:33.000]  congenital issue but you believe that it was vaccines right well for six years
[02:38:33.000 --> 02:38:36.680]  they tried to diagnose her but during that whole six years they could not
[02:38:36.680 --> 02:38:41.080]  figure out what was wrong with her and during that whole time they insisted
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:45.320]  that vaccines were not they couldn't identify what was wrong with you get
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:49.080]  this okay the absurdity of it they couldn't identify what was wrong with it
[02:38:49.080 --> 02:38:53.960]  yet vaccines had nothing to do with it absolutely not so six years later she
[02:38:53.960 --> 02:38:58.440]  got some genetic testing done finally whatever and they said well oh here it
[02:38:58.440 --> 02:39:02.480]  is here's the here's the thing that causes your daughter's problem so anyway
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:06.120]  as a concerned parent nationally try to read up and try to follow it as much as
[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:10.040]  you can that was 20 years ago okay I'm gonna read to you from a government
[02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:13.520]  website website right here a little short article from the US National
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:18.000]  Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health okay government website this
[02:39:18.000 --> 02:39:22.360]  was a study done by the Department of Pediatrics in a university in Italy my
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:28.760]  daughter's disease is called RET syndrome R-E-T-T syndrome okay along with the
[02:39:28.760 --> 02:39:33.880]  classic form of variant forms of RET syndrome and RET syndrome phenotypes are
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:38.920]  also recognized we report on a girl who at age two months developed an acute
[02:39:38.920 --> 02:39:44.080]  encephalopathy with destructive brain damage 12 hours after a cellular
[02:39:44.080 --> 02:39:49.840]  pertussis vaccination okay three months later months later the girl
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:54.880]  manifested a RET syndrome phenotype okay this previously unreported
[02:39:54.880 --> 02:39:59.200]  association emphasized the notion that RET syndrome phenotypes can result from
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:02.920]  different either genetic or environmental causes the environmental
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:09.160]  cause being the acellular pertussis vaccination okay so this whole time
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:13.440]  we're sitting no no no no no here is a report on the government website saying
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:18.320]  where it does now we've come full circle okay the current research on the thing
[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:23.120]  if you read any of the research on it you can't make heads or tails of what's
[02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:26.280]  going on they start off with one premise they end up with another but
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:30.200]  meanwhile in between as it come full circle they're back to not knowing at
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:35.960]  all what causes this thing they just discovered it in 1970 you know my I
[02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:39.960]  looked at looked at each other after she was diagnosed neither one of us have
[02:40:39.960 --> 02:40:44.520]  any genetic problems in either one of our families okay that's right yet they
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:49.080]  say this comes out of nowhere you know the gene but the point is is that they're
[02:40:49.080 --> 02:40:52.600]  not looking in the right place no they're not looking at all they're not
[02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:56.960]  doing the studies you'll find in so many cases that these studies that we few
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:41:01.360]  studies that we do have are coming from other countries because our government
[02:41:01.360 --> 02:41:06.600]  is so owned lock stock and barrel by the big pharmaceutical companies are just
[02:41:06.600 --> 02:41:10.240]  like their own by Monsanto who's pushing through their genetically modified
[02:41:10.240 --> 02:41:15.480]  organisms in other countries they're pushing back against GMOs they're
[02:41:15.480 --> 02:41:19.160]  pushing back against vaccines they actually are doing some studies but we
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:22.080]  don't have the studies being done here and the studies that are being done are
[02:41:22.080 --> 02:41:27.640]  being done to serve the interest to give plausible deniability to the large
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:32.400]  companies I just read the conclusions of the Journal of the American Medical
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:37.480]  Association JAMA talking about how the FDA studies have falsification
[02:41:37.480 --> 02:41:40.800]  submission of false information problems with adverse events reporting
[02:41:40.800 --> 02:41:44.840]  protocol violations and on and on and on they are not doing the science the
[02:41:44.840 --> 02:41:49.600]  science is not settled it hasn't even begun they haven't even done the studies
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:51.800]  they haven't even published the stage you're talking about your daughter 20
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:56.480]  years ago of course back in the 70s and 80s autism as well as many these other
[02:41:56.480 --> 02:42:01.480]  diseases were so incredibly rare there was one in 2,000 cases last year it had
[02:42:01.480 --> 02:42:05.560]  jumped to one in 68 I don't know what it is this year but it's growing
[02:42:05.560 --> 02:42:10.240]  exponentially where are the studies on this if it's not vaccines what is it
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:13.840]  they're not doing the studies on this was there anything else that you want to
[02:42:13.840 --> 02:42:19.160]  say Dave I just wanted to say that I mean there's the association with the
[02:42:19.160 --> 02:42:22.720]  vaccines you have all these modern day before there was no cases of this or
[02:42:22.720 --> 02:42:27.240]  whatever it comes out of nowhere but this is a case examination here I mean
[02:42:27.240 --> 02:42:31.400]  besides the other vaccines for all different kinds of diseases that and
[02:42:31.400 --> 02:42:35.200]  what it causes in everything here's a very weird one that's caused by it and
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:38.760]  but they're back to professor they don't know what causes it they have people
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:42.880]  with the marker in the gene that don't have it they have people who have it
[02:42:42.880 --> 02:42:47.080]  that don't have any marker it's it they still don't know it but they're looking
[02:42:47.080 --> 02:42:50.960]  in the wrong place and they don't want to look there they just don't want to look
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:54.800]  there absolutely don't have the kind of we don't have the information that lets
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:43:00.280]  us know what percentage and some people are predisposed to that some people
[02:43:00.280 --> 02:43:04.800]  they have to have these adjuvants in because they're not getting the response
[02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:09.560]  to the vaccine so they add more adjuvants to it that to some other people who are
[02:43:09.560 --> 02:43:13.880]  maybe more sensitive to it that causes them to have an over-the-top adverse
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:16.800]  reaction while you still have some people on the other end of the scale who
[02:43:16.800 --> 02:43:21.200]  still won't produce the antibodies that's why they're not effective in so many
[02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:25.040]  cases that's why we saw back in this case study that talked about earlier you
[02:43:25.040 --> 02:43:31.680]  had back in 1987 52% of the people who got measles had been vaccinated what does
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:35.000]  that say about their efficacy where do they get this 99% number we see them
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.920]  continuing to throw this number out even though in the most recent outbreak of
[02:43:39.920 --> 02:43:44.000]  about a hundred people or so and in Disneyland they had 14% of the people
[02:43:44.000 --> 02:43:48.400]  had been vaccinated these numbers are not adding up thanks Dave let's go on to
[02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:52.560]  indigo kid in colorado indigo
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:57.680]  hi David yeah I had military vaccines and I was a kid with my dad overseas my
[02:43:57.680 --> 02:44:02.440]  brother had them he's autistic I have a lot of issues as well but I have a
[02:44:02.440 --> 02:44:06.440]  government study in front of me I'm trying the National Center for Biotechnology
[02:44:06.440 --> 02:44:10.520]  Information people can Google the title of it comparison of blood and brain
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:15.960]  mercury levels and monkeys exposed to vaccines contain thimerosal or how we
[02:44:15.960 --> 02:44:19.360]  pronounce that but I'll read this directly from the study the abstract
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:23.240]  says recent publications have proposed a direct link between the use of
[02:44:23.240 --> 02:44:27.400]  thimerosal containing vaccines with sufficient rise of the number of
[02:44:27.400 --> 02:44:31.200]  children being diagnosed with autism the Institute of Medicine 2001 review
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:36.000]  did note the possibility of relationship recommended further studies that
[02:44:36.000 --> 02:44:41.240]  recently published second review IOM 2004 appears to have abandoned the earlier
[02:44:41.240 --> 02:44:44.920]  recommendation as well as backed away from the American Academy of Pediatrics
[02:44:44.920 --> 02:44:48.640]  School approach is difficult to understand given our current limited
[02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:53.000]  knowledge of thimerosal a compound that hasn't will be continued to be ejected
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:57.280]  in millions of newborns and this information is critical we respond to
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:01.200]  public concerns regarding safety of child immunization well absolutely you
[02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:04.600]  know what they're doing is that that thimerosal was put in as a preservative
[02:45:04.600 --> 02:45:08.160]  in the vaccines now a lot of them will say that that's no longer in the
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:14.440]  vaccines if that's true still remains the question was that a link in some of
[02:45:14.440 --> 02:45:19.280]  the health conditions that we saw and if that's true how did they ever ever
[02:45:19.280 --> 02:45:26.200]  justify putting mercury in the vaccines I remember 20 years ago I was trying to
[02:45:26.200 --> 02:45:31.000]  use contacts and there was a cleaning solution that had thimerosal in it the
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:35.400]  minute I put it into my eyes I got this red stinging mice turn blood red I told
[02:45:35.400 --> 02:45:39.880]  the optician I can't use contacts evidently and they said no no I think
[02:45:39.880 --> 02:45:44.160]  you're just having a reaction to the thimerosal in the site in the solution
[02:45:44.160 --> 02:45:49.160]  we'll give you one without thimerosal at that point I could I could use it but I
[02:45:49.160 --> 02:45:53.960]  mentioned that just recently to an optician I guess it was about if not
[02:45:53.960 --> 02:45:57.640]  recently it was probably about five years ago I was considering using contacts
[02:45:57.640 --> 02:46:01.520]  again and I said yeah I quit using them because I was having problems with the
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:04.960]  cleaning solutions especially thimerosal he goes oh no they banned that that's
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:08.520]  mercury that was the first time at that point that I realized the connection
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:13.880]  with the thimerosal why would they allow why would they ban it for putting it
[02:46:13.880 --> 02:46:18.240]  into a contact lens cleaning solution why would they ban it there while
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:22.880]  they're still allowing it inject to be injected into people that's the question
[02:46:22.880 --> 02:46:28.040]  what are they doing to analyze the safety to inspect the safety of these
[02:46:28.040 --> 02:46:31.240]  vaccines and the additives that are put into them so whether or not they're
[02:46:31.240 --> 02:46:35.280]  putting thimerosal and what about the other additives that are going in what
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:38.120]  about the adjuvants what about the aluminum so many things that they're
[02:46:38.120 --> 02:46:43.360]  putting in and that really is the issue thanks Indigo let's go to Brian in
[02:46:43.360 --> 02:46:49.840]  Tennessee Brian Brandon sorry Brandon in Tennessee yes hello Dave hi thanks for
[02:46:49.840 --> 02:46:55.320]  taking my call I really appreciate you guys covering this topic about that
[02:46:55.320 --> 02:47:01.880]  scene you know obviously don't hear a lot about it in the media at all I guess
[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:05.320]  the reason I wanted to call is I've kind of been inspired to kind of call and
[02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:14.960]  tell my personal story in 2009 I ended up getting these swine flu vaccine you
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:20.360]  know at that time I wasn't aware I wasn't following you guys I really didn't
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:23.760]  know much about anything I just kind of fell into that fear that the media was
[02:47:23.760 --> 02:47:29.360]  promoting about that they need to get that vaccine too much later I was at
[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:33.640]  work and one of my feet started falling asleep and I said well that's odd and it
[02:47:33.640 --> 02:47:38.880]  wouldn't wake back up well finally it woke back up well two months later the
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:42.480]  other one started to fall asleep and it was kind of off and on like that for a
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:46.720]  while until finally they both fell asleep and then they started to burn and
[02:47:46.720 --> 02:47:51.560]  you know I ended up going to doctor the neurologist and down down that I had
[02:47:51.560 --> 02:47:55.280]  what's called peripheral neuropathy which there was another gentleman I was
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:59.440]  listening to Alex a couple maybe last week had called in had the same thing
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:04.000]  you know it's very frustrating there's really no cure for it and it can be
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:09.640]  progressive but anyway you know I'll never get another vaccine I was 28 when
[02:48:09.640 --> 02:48:14.680]  I had that vaccine you know now I'm 33 and you know at the time I got this
[02:48:14.680 --> 02:48:18.160]  vaccine I was just getting ready to graduate with my master's degree and
[02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:24.280]  you know obviously this has really had a negative impact on my plans for
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:29.520]  life you know oh yeah and I just can't warn other people enough to say hey you
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:35.640]  know that you know you just don't know well I played excerpts from the 60
[02:48:35.640 --> 02:48:42.120]  minutes report back in the 70s about the swine flu vaccine at that point in
[02:48:42.120 --> 02:48:48.680]  time and of course Wallace what was his name it's not Chris Wallace but his dad
[02:48:48.680 --> 02:48:53.600]  Mike Wallace was 60 minutes talked to the director of the CDC and asked him he
[02:48:53.600 --> 02:48:57.720]  said how many cases had you guys diagnosed well we didn't really know of
[02:48:57.720 --> 02:49:01.840]  any cases of the swine flu there have been some reported but non verified yet
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:06.680]  they went through this massive vaccination program there were over 4,000
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:10.840]  people who claimed that they were damaged from this swine flu vaccination
[02:49:10.840 --> 02:49:14.840]  programs really the first time they had done a mass panic of the public like
[02:49:14.840 --> 02:49:20.120]  that they had what would in today's dollars be 15 billion dollars worth of
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:27.280]  lawsuits claiming damage most of them from yon beret syndrome so you know you
[02:49:27.280 --> 02:49:30.440]  talk about this and how you didn't really you took the vaccine you weren't
[02:49:30.440 --> 02:49:34.120]  really aware of it you weren't really thinking about it I was around when that
[02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:38.000]  happened I remember people talking about the swine flu vaccine but it never
[02:49:38.000 --> 02:49:43.200]  really clicked with me back at that time didn't click with me for decades so it's
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:46.760]  something that occasionally it will come out just as 60 minutes did a report on
[02:49:46.760 --> 02:49:52.320]  it 40 years ago when the media companies were not essentially owned by the
[02:49:52.320 --> 02:49:56.600]  pharmaceutical companies with every other ad being a pharmaceutical ad they
[02:49:56.600 --> 02:50:01.560]  did an investigation they found some horrendous conflicts of interest as
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:06.080]  well as lying to the public panicking the public over this getting them to take
[02:50:06.080 --> 02:50:10.680]  a vaccine that had not been tested telling them that they had giving them
[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:14.360]  an insert for them to sign because they were trying at the time to pretend that
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:19.920]  they had informed consent they today they say we don't need informed consent at
[02:50:19.920 --> 02:50:24.360]  all they reject the notion of that but 40 years ago they wanted to get the
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:28.120]  informed consent of people nevertheless they gave them information about a
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:32.200]  different vaccine than they were giving them so they weren't even giving them
[02:50:32.200 --> 02:50:35.320]  the information stay with us going to be right back we're going to go to

[02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:35.120]  Texas go ahead Aaron yeah hi hello hi David can you hear me yes yes I hear you
[02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:39.480]  go ahead great I was wondering if you're aware of what they do to the doctors
[02:54:39.480 --> 02:54:45.000]  that are speaking out about vaccinations and there's one doctor who spoke out
[02:54:45.000 --> 02:54:50.920]  about vaccinations and chemtrails about 10 years ago and he was targeted by the
[02:54:50.920 --> 02:54:55.080]  IRS oh yeah oh yeah they've got a lot of ways to deal with people I mean we just
[02:54:55.080 --> 02:55:00.320]  had Dr. Andrew Wakefield on last week Alex was talking to him and as Alex
[02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:04.960]  pointed out his partner has been vindicated of course Dr. Wakefield when
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:08.680]  he was here said he didn't have a half a million dollars or pounds I don't know
[02:55:08.680 --> 02:55:13.920]  who's in the UK at the time to defend himself but eventually he's he's being
[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:18.720]  cleared as well because they've now had a full investigative full investigation of
[02:55:18.720 --> 02:55:22.640]  his partner who's been vindicated in the results that they were looking at so
[02:55:22.640 --> 02:55:26.600]  they will come after you in any way that they can they'll try to destroy your
[02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:32.360]  medical license but you know we have to understand that there are bigger issues
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:36.360]  in this everybody who is a whistleblower understands that they're going to be
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:40.600]  attacked individually as persons are going to attack your reputation they're
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:45.000]  going to try to attack you financially that's why we need to hang together and
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:49.640]  that's why we need to publicize this and stand with those people go ahead yeah
[02:55:49.640 --> 02:55:53.920]  this doctor he spoke out about chemtrails and vaccinations ten years
[02:55:53.920 --> 02:55:59.240]  ago and he was targeted by the IRS and he spent the last eight years in jail on
[02:55:59.240 --> 02:56:04.160]  bogus tax charges and right now we're trying to help him get out his name is
[02:56:04.160 --> 02:56:09.200]  Dr. Kent Hovind and his website is free Kent Hovind.com
[02:56:09.200 --> 02:56:14.560]  okay really need people to stand together he's a strong Christian and he
[02:56:14.560 --> 02:56:19.520]  also talked about the lies and of evolution and the government doesn't
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:23.480]  like them at all speaking out on these truths because he asked who where do
[02:56:23.480 --> 02:56:27.400]  your rights come from and that's the most dangerous question that you can
[02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:32.280]  ask oh that's right and of course Chris Cuomo told us that our rights come from
[02:56:32.280 --> 02:56:36.240]  not from God but they come from government because I guess Chris Cuomo
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:38.880]  hasn't read the Declaration of Independence so he doesn't understand
[02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:41.680]  the principles that our country's founded upon well thank you so much that's
[02:56:41.680 --> 02:56:48.720]  Kent Hovind.com we'll look that up let's go to Sherri in Missouri Sherri
[02:56:48.720 --> 02:56:54.040]  good afternoon I think it's important to speak about the delivery of the
[02:56:54.040 --> 02:57:01.080]  vaccination when it's inserted into the bloodstream through the skin it does
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:06.640]  not provoke the immune system as if it's taken into the mucous membranes mm-hmm
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:12.360]  yeah absolutely that's the initial response of the body is through the
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:16.880]  mucous membranes and so then because it doesn't provoke the immune system what
[02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:20.720]  they do is they add things like aluminum that they call adjuvants to
[02:57:20.720 --> 02:57:25.360]  artificially provoke the immune system but then of course that has other effects
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:31.520]  as well that are not desirable well right but what I'm saying is that most if
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:36.960]  you want a safe vaccine or inoculation that it should go through the mucous
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:42.560]  membranes mm-hmm which provokes and incites the immune system to kick in
[02:57:42.560 --> 02:57:49.000]  for a response and that's natural that's normal absolutely and you know when
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:55.920]  we're talking about this to see the panic from people about measles when I
[02:57:55.920 --> 02:58:01.440]  grew up as a child we didn't have any vaccines for measles it was a childhood
[02:58:01.440 --> 02:58:05.240]  disease it wasn't a serious thing if you got these childhood diseases as a
[02:58:05.240 --> 02:58:09.800]  child but if you got them later in life or if you got them as a baby it was a
[02:58:09.800 --> 02:58:13.800]  very serious thing as we're talking to dr. Jane orient about it she said yeah
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:17.000]  the problem is is that there was some immunity that would be passed on from
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.680]  the mothers who had genuine immunity because they had suffered from the
[02:58:19.680 --> 02:58:23.760]  disease that would be passed on to their infants and people would get it as a
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:27.040]  child and they would have lifetime immunity that will protect them as
[02:58:27.040 --> 02:58:31.720]  adults but these vaccines are not effective at protecting people stay with
[02:58:31.720 --> 02:58:34.280]  us we're going to be right back take the rest of these calls and join us

[03:00:06.320 --> 03:00:14.600]  because there's a war on for your mind
[03:00:14.600 --> 03:00:17.920]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show and overdrive I want to get to at least
[03:00:17.920 --> 03:00:23.040]  crystal George and Andrew we'll see if we can get any farther than that but I
[03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:26.520]  want to try to get to at least these three calls who've been on hold for a
[03:00:26.520 --> 03:00:33.120]  while let's go to crystal and Arizona first crystal yeah hi go ahead I have
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:39.640]  your life you know my daughter back when I was active duty military got these
[03:00:39.640 --> 03:00:48.080]  vaccines and now she's handicapped and you know it's a crying shame to find out
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:53.680]  that it's these vaccinations that are harming our children do you did it happen
[03:00:53.680 --> 03:00:57.280]  right after she got her vaccine what makes you think that it was due to her
[03:00:57.280 --> 03:01:01.760]  vaccination was she normal before she got the vaccines or she was normal
[03:01:01.760 --> 03:01:07.080]  actually she was normal and then I started to see a change and everybody
[03:01:07.080 --> 03:01:11.640]  else told me no don't worry about it's no big deal you know this is normal for
[03:01:11.640 --> 03:01:19.800]  child and you know it just went downhill from there and my daughter is now
[03:01:19.800 --> 03:01:27.840]  almost 18 years old and she's equivalent to maybe a six-year-old I'm so sorry to
[03:01:27.840 --> 03:01:31.280]  hear that that's why we need to have studies done that's why we need to know
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:36.080]  what the risk is when we're looking at childhood diseases like measles mumps
[03:01:36.080 --> 03:01:41.560]  that have really they want to scare people about how fatal they are but
[03:01:41.560 --> 03:01:46.360]  they have a very low mortality rate compared to most diseases when we look
[03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:49.520]  at the risk and there certainly is a risk there is a risk of serious
[03:01:49.520 --> 03:01:53.240]  complications with any of those diseases but there's also a risk of serious
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:57.280]  complications with the vaccines and we're not given the information about what
[03:01:57.280 --> 03:02:01.400]  the trade-off is there so that we can make the decisions about ourselves and
[03:02:01.400 --> 03:02:04.600]  about our children that's the most important aspect so sorry to hear that
[03:02:04.600 --> 03:02:10.800]  crystal let's go to Andrew in Illinois Andrew hello hello you're live good show
[03:02:10.800 --> 03:02:16.320]  I just wanted to say that the vaccines they've got to cut way back on them
[03:02:16.320 --> 03:02:21.360]  because they're not being tested that all the runoff of aluminum from the chem
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:25.360]  trailing and the fluoride from the water treatment's going into the rivers
[03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:31.440]  into the oceans and concentrating is killing off all fish in plant life and
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:36.120]  that's going to be looked into and the glycoposphate to the roundup yeah
[03:02:36.120 --> 03:02:40.480]  absolutely and of course we have no do we get aluminum that we see
[03:02:40.480 --> 03:02:44.280]  precipitating into the water supply but of course we get that in a lot of the
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:48.520]  cans that we drink things out of just as we're talking earlier about the effects
[03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:53.720]  of plastic in terms of estrogenic effects there's also the effect of
[03:02:53.720 --> 03:02:58.560]  aluminum from even from our cooking utensils in many cases and there's
[03:02:58.560 --> 03:03:04.400]  links to Alzheimer's with that as well thank you Andrew let's go to George and
[03:03:04.400 --> 03:03:10.440]  Washington George yeah can you talk about common law and how can we invoke
[03:03:10.440 --> 03:03:16.200]  common law on this land is the land of the freezer well you know I think in
[03:03:16.200 --> 03:03:22.280]  terms of where we cross the line for me personally once we have the kind of
[03:03:22.280 --> 03:03:26.200]  medical tyranny and we're very close to that because we've seen this now with
[03:03:26.200 --> 03:03:30.240]  Obamacare where they can force you to buy insurance me where does the
[03:03:30.240 --> 03:03:34.240]  government have the the constitutional authority to force you to buy
[03:03:34.240 --> 03:03:39.080]  anything from a private company it's not there they know they don't have the
[03:03:39.080 --> 03:03:44.200]  constitutional authority for mandates so the Supreme Court changed it for them
[03:03:44.200 --> 03:03:48.320]  and said okay well it's a tax and we assert that we can tax you directly from
[03:03:48.320 --> 03:03:51.920]  Washington which I would say is also a questionable constitutional issue as well
[03:03:51.920 --> 03:03:56.280]  but that's the way that they sold it to us and as many of us said at the time we
[03:03:56.280 --> 03:04:00.600]  believe that Justice Chief Justice Roberts was being blackmailed quite
[03:04:00.600 --> 03:04:04.760]  frankly if you look at the fact that he wrote both the dissenting and the
[03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:09.920]  concurring opinion and he sided with Obamacare after he had said that it
[03:04:09.920 --> 03:04:13.800]  wasn't legal so he's been on both sides of this issue he wrote both opinions that
[03:04:13.800 --> 03:04:18.760]  looked very suspicious but for me the line is when they come and tell me that
[03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:23.920]  I am forced to inject something into my body or into my children's body I'm not
[03:04:23.920 --> 03:04:27.480]  gonna I'm not gonna take that let's try to get one more call in George and
[03:04:27.480 --> 03:04:30.200]  Washington has been on hold for a while George go ahead
[03:04:30.200 --> 03:04:36.680]  sorry we're out of time I was looking at the clock here sorry George if you call
[03:04:36.680 --> 03:04:40.040]  back tomorrow we'll try to put you at the front of the line like we did Erin
[03:04:40.040 --> 03:04:45.240]  today that's it for today's show join us tomorrow at 11 central for the Alex Jones
[03:04:45.240 --> 03:04:51.600]  show and join us tonight for the nightly news that's at 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern
