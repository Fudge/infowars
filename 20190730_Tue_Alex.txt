[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from
[00:14.120 --> 00:29.920]  the front lines of the Info War.
[00:29.920 --> 00:32.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:32.840 --> 00:38.960]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and we're already three hours into the special 40-hour global
[00:38.960 --> 00:39.960]  live transmission.
[00:39.960 --> 00:46.120]  Yes, it's Clown World 2 tonight and tomorrow.
[00:46.120 --> 00:51.440]  Live coverage of the Democrat debates out of the once great city of Detroit, Michigan,
[00:51.440 --> 00:58.320]  now totally destroyed and infested by literal rats and corruption collapsing into the crime
[00:58.320 --> 01:02.440]  wave of leftist, big government union control.
[01:02.440 --> 01:07.360]  Oh, but if you criticize that, you're a racist if you try to clean up cities and get investment
[01:07.360 --> 01:13.000]  into them like President Trump has done, because the Democrats have a stranglehold on these
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.960]  inner cities and poor areas, whether you be white or black or Hispanic or whatever, and
[01:17.960 --> 01:23.680]  they have a system of control, and then they invite in all the freeloaders, and then people
[01:23.680 --> 01:28.360]  give the homeless all the money so they can live under bridges and to inject heroin all
[01:28.360 --> 01:29.360]  day.
[01:29.360 --> 01:36.180]  500, 600 yards from where I shit are a bunch of white, homeless people, demonic, nasty
[01:36.180 --> 01:42.220]  cretins with their fancy outfits on, and all the money that leftist are handing out the
[01:42.220 --> 01:46.360]  windows of their cars, they're vomiting on the street, flipping people off that don't
[01:46.360 --> 01:51.360]  give them money, and there's black homeless that act just like it, and I can't stand them
[01:51.360 --> 01:54.060]  whether they're white or black, they make me sick.
[01:54.060 --> 01:58.160]  But most of the people in places like Baltimore, and most of the people in places like the
[01:58.160 --> 02:02.440]  bad areas of Chicago, the South Side or South Side of Dallas, they're there for poverty
[02:02.440 --> 02:06.960]  and they want out of it and they are begging for real help, but these Democrat run cities
[02:06.960 --> 02:11.800]  will not bring the help because they control it and they control the welfare and they suck
[02:11.800 --> 02:17.120]  the money out and they skim off the top, and the Democrats are famous for this, whether
[02:17.120 --> 02:22.400]  they be white Democrats, whether they be black Democrats, this is how the scam works.
[02:22.400 --> 02:26.400]  And Trump is calling it out and being called a racist for it, it just shows that's all
[02:26.400 --> 02:30.880]  they've got, Russia Gates totally fake, so now all they've got is Donald Trump's a racist
[02:30.880 --> 02:36.040]  because he's the guy that 45 years ago bought up fancy golf clubs that were all falling
[02:36.040 --> 02:41.760]  apart because the old rich white people that owned them wouldn't let anybody who wasn't
[02:41.760 --> 02:48.680]  white or even a wasp into them and he could buy them up cheap, open them up to everybody
[02:48.680 --> 02:50.440]  and boom, make 10 times the money.
[02:50.440 --> 02:55.280]  Yeah, Trump's not a racist, but he is against people that are trying to undermine this country
[02:55.280 --> 02:58.360]  like the Chikoms who are extremely racist.
[02:58.360 --> 03:02.600]  It's just amazing, but listen, there's so much to get to today.
[03:02.600 --> 03:09.040]  It makes my head spin how much we're going to be going over here and believe me, this
[03:09.040 --> 03:13.280]  is going to be a worldwide broadcast that nobody's going to want to miss.
[03:13.280 --> 03:16.840]  Gavin McInnis is going to be joining us in the second hour, Robert Barnes is here in
[03:16.840 --> 03:21.080]  Austin, he's going to be co-hosting in the third hour, Paul Joseph Watson is in the
[03:21.080 --> 03:24.800]  fourth hour and we've got a bunch of other special guests throughout the evening and
[03:24.800 --> 03:28.840]  throughout tomorrow and we've got our reporters, Millie Weaver, we've got our great reporter
[03:28.840 --> 03:33.240]  Caitlin Bennett and her team are in Detroit, Michigan, they're going to be giving us live
[03:33.240 --> 03:38.080]  feeds coming up today and tonight before and after talking to folks unfiltered in the streets
[03:38.080 --> 03:44.440]  they were getting Lieutenant Governors of California, you name it, Attorney Generals,
[03:44.440 --> 03:50.120]  on video last time we did the live coverage from Florida, from Miami.
[03:50.120 --> 03:54.280]  So it's going to be coverage you don't get anywhere else censored coverage and if the
[03:54.280 --> 03:59.840]  TV viewers and radio listeners will help engage in activism against the globalists, it's going
[03:59.840 --> 04:03.480]  to be amazing, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:03.480 --> 04:08.520]  That's at infowars.com forward slash show where you can share that link to this live
[04:08.520 --> 04:12.560]  40 hour special broadcast but if you want to get past the censors at Twitter and Facebook
[04:12.560 --> 04:17.760]  that have flagged info wars to block it, use clownworld.us and people aren't having problems
[04:17.760 --> 04:22.520]  with that and it's getting past the shadow banners so it's fun to be part of the war,
[04:22.520 --> 04:27.720]  clownworld.us has the big live feed today for the next 40 hours up there and it's got the
[04:27.720 --> 04:35.160]  last debates there as well so clownworld.us, clownworld.us please share that link.
[04:35.160 --> 04:39.080]  Now we're going to go to break for 60 seconds when we come back.
[04:39.080 --> 04:43.920]  We are going to launch into the giant developments on so many fronts, Trump's powerful press
[04:43.920 --> 04:50.160]  conference this morning as he boarded Marine One and just the insanity of the left going
[04:50.160 --> 04:58.000]  full commie, full race war, it is all about to unfold on this July 30th, 2019 kickoff
[04:58.000 --> 05:00.840]  of clownworld.
[05:00.840 --> 05:02.880]  Robert Barnes, what has big tech become?
[05:02.880 --> 05:05.960]  Big tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[05:05.960 --> 05:10.400]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities
[05:10.400 --> 05:14.280]  over two decades and because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the
[05:14.280 --> 05:17.600]  members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the
[05:17.600 --> 05:21.520]  public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic
[05:21.520 --> 05:25.320]  consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will become
[05:25.320 --> 05:29.080]  the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran
[05:29.080 --> 05:32.920]  American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able
[05:32.920 --> 05:34.560]  to recover after the Great Depression.
[05:34.560 --> 05:39.760]  The informer's audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to make
[05:39.760 --> 05:44.480]  real the act of independent free speech, to make real the original promise of an independent
[05:44.480 --> 05:45.480]  free press.
[05:45.480 --> 05:49.920]  This collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle
[05:49.920 --> 05:53.680]  with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole
[05:53.680 --> 05:54.880]  time it's not happening.
[05:54.880 --> 05:56.720]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[05:56.720 --> 06:05.400]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw, even it is what you just saw.
[06:05.400 --> 06:11.960]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[06:11.960 --> 06:23.560]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[06:23.560 --> 06:31.120]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex
[06:31.120 --> 06:32.120]  Jones.
[06:32.120 --> 06:38.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am wound up, the quickening is here, it is insane.
[06:38.640 --> 06:46.200]  Think about how everything that we have pioneered here on this broadcast is now out in the open,
[06:46.200 --> 06:51.280]  is now confirmed, is now in everybody's face.
[06:51.280 --> 06:54.680]  Total world government is openly being announced.
[06:54.680 --> 06:59.640]  Animal human clones, they are now admitting are walking around.
[06:59.640 --> 07:05.520]  There is a planetary operation to reduce the human population by at least 90%.
[07:05.520 --> 07:10.240]  There is a total war on Christians going on on a planetary scale.
[07:10.240 --> 07:16.720]  Massive giant pedophile rings with the exact people I implicated 10 years ago with precisely
[07:16.720 --> 07:21.120]  what they were doing is also now coming out.
[07:21.120 --> 07:24.720]  But when I walk down the street, left his point at me and they go, oh, where are the
[07:24.720 --> 07:26.920]  animal human clones?
[07:26.920 --> 07:30.880]  Oh, where are the pedophiles, Alex?
[07:30.880 --> 07:31.880]  Fake news.
[07:31.880 --> 07:34.320]  Yeah, well, it doesn't work anymore.
[07:34.320 --> 07:42.440]  There's Yahoo News, AP, Times of London, they're all reporting, ladies and gentlemen, that
[07:42.440 --> 07:51.440]  animal human hybrids to be developed in Japan after banned controversy lifted London Independent.
[07:51.440 --> 07:56.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, Hitler was able to clone rabbits.
[07:56.480 --> 08:00.640]  That was declassified in the 1960s.
[08:00.640 --> 08:08.880]  Hitler was able to clone rabbits, OK, and then it jets as well in atomic weapons, but
[08:08.880 --> 08:13.880]  the U.S. and the British went in and blew up his underground nuke facilities repeatedly.
[08:13.880 --> 08:17.880]  That's all the stuff people forget about World War II.
[08:17.880 --> 08:20.440]  Imagine how much more advanced things are today, OK?
[08:20.440 --> 08:24.680]  They had animal human hybrids.
[08:24.680 --> 08:32.360]  In the 1980s, it was admitted in scientific journals that I read on air in 1996.
[08:32.360 --> 08:36.680]  So there is an advanced future already taking place.
[08:36.680 --> 08:41.160]  There is already an advanced civilization.
[08:41.160 --> 08:45.360]  There is already a breakaway civilization, and it doesn't want the rest of us to be part
[08:45.360 --> 08:46.360]  of it.
[08:46.360 --> 08:49.520]  And so they need world government in place to keep other countries and other groups from
[08:49.520 --> 08:54.640]  developing technologies that have already been developed.
[08:54.640 --> 09:01.400]  People like Bill Gates are fronts for IBM and a huge Manhattan project of technocracy,
[09:01.400 --> 09:04.240]  which is to be a breakaway civilization.
[09:04.240 --> 09:08.920]  They made the decision to merge humans with machines because the globalists want to basically
[09:08.920 --> 09:13.520]  merge with silicon so they, quote, don't die, and they're going to use us as the guinea
[09:13.520 --> 09:20.040]  pigs in mass rollouts of this, but we'll be given the Trojan horse jacked systems.
[09:20.040 --> 09:27.040]  Now, the first clip I'm going to go to, before I get into all this news today, is up on infowars.com
[09:27.040 --> 09:34.680]  and newswars.com, and it's right dead center in the middle column of drudgereport.com.
[09:34.680 --> 09:40.320]  It's a newswars.com article, and it's just a short two-minute video clip out of a live
[09:40.320 --> 09:48.880]  show a few days ago, last week, where I simply asked the question, what's wrong with big
[09:48.880 --> 09:52.160]  tech's eyes?
[09:52.160 --> 09:58.640]  Because they're under white lights, lights are in their faces, and they've got pupils
[09:58.640 --> 10:03.000]  that you only have when you are in starlight.
[10:03.000 --> 10:09.280]  When the moon's out, your eyes aren't dilated like that, and if your eyes are dilated like
[10:09.280 --> 10:15.400]  that and you're out walking around, you will burn out your corneas in a matter of hours.
[10:15.400 --> 10:22.240]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I've seen people on three hits of acid before, and their eyes
[10:22.240 --> 10:23.240]  don't get half that big.
[10:23.240 --> 10:25.880]  I've seen people on ecstasy, they don't get half that big.
[10:25.880 --> 10:33.000]  I've seen people literally at raves I went to in college who were taking LSD with peyote,
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.960]  you name it, it doesn't do that.
[10:34.960 --> 10:36.880]  It only gets half that dilated.
[10:36.880 --> 10:39.240]  The police, when they pull you over, shine a light in your eyes.
[10:39.240 --> 10:40.240]  Why do they do that?
[10:40.240 --> 10:44.680]  Because they trained to know when you're on serious hallucinogens and some narcotics
[10:44.680 --> 10:46.400]  to do that.
[10:46.400 --> 10:53.720]  Tim Cook and all these guys have eyes so dilated that it would kill most people to have them
[10:53.720 --> 10:55.720]  that big.
[10:55.720 --> 11:01.040]  You'd be on so many drugs when he's before Congress, when he is in testimony in China,
[11:01.040 --> 11:06.880]  when he is on TV at Grand Central Station with lights in his face glaring, you can't
[11:06.880 --> 11:10.680]  even see his irises.
[11:10.680 --> 11:17.200]  This guy is on super hardcore drugs or he's already had wires put in his brain, which
[11:17.200 --> 11:20.640]  is the in game goal of all of these people.
[11:20.640 --> 11:26.960]  The only one I've seen that doesn't have eyes like this is Bill Gates.
[11:26.960 --> 11:29.200]  So we need to think about the big picture here.
[11:29.200 --> 11:32.960]  Trump talked about secret technologies, advanced technologies, the secrets of the universe
[11:32.960 --> 11:34.360]  that are already being discovered.
[11:34.360 --> 11:40.600]  He now is getting briefed on all this, that's why they're panicking and freaked out.
[11:40.600 --> 11:43.600]  And Trump wants to roll more of these out, they're keeping a lot of the projects secret
[11:43.600 --> 11:44.600]  from him.
[11:44.600 --> 11:47.560]  That's why they're trying to keep him isolated at the White House.
[11:47.560 --> 11:51.200]  That's why they're calling it an emergency that he's in there.
[11:51.200 --> 11:54.800]  First thing he did was say, hey, the average drug takes five years to approve, many of
[11:54.800 --> 11:58.520]  ten years, we're going to lift that for people that are already terminal or people that sign
[11:58.520 --> 11:59.520]  waivers.
[11:59.520 --> 12:01.880]  That's totally reasonable, that's a libertarian deal.
[12:01.880 --> 12:05.120]  The left didn't want that because there's a bunch of treatments and things that are
[12:05.120 --> 12:10.680]  basically cures that do work that the medical system has, but they're called disruptive
[12:10.680 --> 12:16.240]  technologies and the life expectancy in the West is actually dropping and our fertility
[12:16.240 --> 12:20.960]  is down 90% because they don't want us to have a future, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:20.960 --> 12:27.120]  So I don't know exactly what's going on with these guys, but Elon Musk is on TV saying
[12:27.120 --> 12:30.800]  I used to think we could resist the AI takeover, but now we're going to merge with it, put
[12:30.800 --> 12:34.280]  electrodes in your brain starting next year, we're going to have kiosk at malls, you're
[12:34.280 --> 12:39.600]  going to come get your wires put into your brain, it'll be so trendy and you won't be
[12:39.600 --> 12:42.680]  able to buy or sell in the future unless you have it, so everyone's going to have to accept
[12:42.680 --> 12:43.680]  this.
[12:43.680 --> 12:51.800]  He says all the classic biblical arguments, but for it and he says that you're going to
[12:51.800 --> 12:55.360]  merge with it and you're not going to be able to help it and that's the way it is and all
[12:55.360 --> 13:04.240]  three of the people he had during the 30-something minute presentation had giant pupils and
[13:04.240 --> 13:09.200]  we're sweating profusely, ladies and gentlemen, think about that.
[13:09.200 --> 13:10.200]  Think about that.
[13:10.200 --> 13:15.480]  And so Matt Drudge, I'm very thankful, is linking to a lot of our special reports that
[13:15.480 --> 13:19.240]  we host on our own site in FullWars.com because we're banned everywhere else.
[13:19.240 --> 13:21.880]  We host our own sites and they're trying to take those down.
[13:21.880 --> 13:24.600]  I just wish it was as much attention as it does when it goes on drugs, the biggest news
[13:24.600 --> 13:27.600]  site in the world that we would even have a bigger report that goes through all the
[13:27.600 --> 13:30.760]  scientific evidence and their admissions, they're taking micro doses of drugs every
[13:30.760 --> 13:35.200]  day and doing all this, but it's like my message to the president that I know got to the president
[13:35.200 --> 13:36.560]  because Drudge linked to it.
[13:36.560 --> 13:40.320]  I wish I would have added how there's a deep state in control of big tech and that's another
[13:40.320 --> 13:43.640]  reason the president really needs to act and how foreign powers are working with big tech,
[13:43.640 --> 13:46.640]  but still the message got to the president, so thank you, Matt Drudge.
[13:46.640 --> 13:50.520]  Here is the censored report on what's going on with big tech's eyes.
[13:50.520 --> 13:52.520]  Here it is.
[13:52.520 --> 14:01.120]  Do you know the top Nazi, Werner von Braun, wrote a 1959 book or 1949 book, I'm going
[14:01.120 --> 14:06.240]  from memory here, called Project Mars where the Elans are the aliens who end up taking
[14:06.240 --> 14:07.240]  over the earth.
[14:07.240 --> 14:10.640]  We wear the Elans and the Elan invasion.
[14:10.640 --> 14:12.920]  Dr. Werner von Braun, wonder what he knew.
[14:12.920 --> 14:18.560]  When I watched his promo about this with executives from his company, they all look like they're
[14:18.560 --> 14:19.560]  on hardcore drugs.
[14:19.560 --> 14:26.040]  I mean, they're like sweating, their eyes are like lit up, like, I mean, they look nuts.
[14:26.040 --> 14:27.040]  You know what somebody's on drugs.
[14:27.040 --> 14:31.080]  You know, they admit Silicon Valley is into hardcore speed and illusions.
[14:31.080 --> 14:34.680]  They're taking IV drips at work of DMT.
[14:34.680 --> 14:40.000]  They're taking LSD microdosis and a psilocybin mushrooms and peyote every day.
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.080]  Who in the hell would want to join with these people?
[14:43.080 --> 14:45.800]  I've seen people take like three hits of acid, their eyes aren't that big.
[14:45.800 --> 14:46.800]  What the hell are they on?
[14:46.800 --> 14:50.560]  One of the crew members said maybe they've already got this whole neuro link wires hooks
[14:50.560 --> 14:54.120]  on their brain because this PKD pointed out Philip K. Dick back in the 70s.
[14:54.120 --> 14:59.000]  The cyberpunk future is where you can get any type of pleasure you want, just plug in.
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.480]  But no one wants to even get up or eat for weeks or days.
[15:01.480 --> 15:05.200]  You just die because you just plug all this in and it's the matrix.
[15:05.200 --> 15:09.560]  And now the matrix is here and you look at Tim Cook or Elon Musk or any of his executives
[15:09.560 --> 15:12.400]  when they're up there on that stage, they'll be under white lights.
[15:12.400 --> 15:14.800]  Their pupils are 90% open.
[15:14.800 --> 15:15.800]  Zuckerberg.
[15:15.800 --> 15:16.800]  All of them.
[15:16.800 --> 15:18.080]  These people either have brain chips.
[15:18.080 --> 15:19.080]  That's it.
[15:19.080 --> 15:21.520]  These guys are wire heads.
[15:21.520 --> 15:22.720]  Something's going on.
[15:22.720 --> 15:26.920]  I'm in here underneath bright lights and my pupils are very little.
[15:26.920 --> 15:27.920]  Now zoom in if you can.
[15:27.920 --> 15:30.040]  My pupils are tiny because I'm not on drugs.
[15:30.040 --> 15:31.920]  I've had two cups of coffee today.
[15:31.920 --> 15:33.920]  Here, let me show you my pupils, okay?
[15:33.920 --> 15:34.920]  My pupils are little.
[15:34.920 --> 15:35.920]  They're supposed to close.
[15:35.920 --> 15:39.560]  That's what happens under the sun or under bright lights, but not these guys.
[15:39.560 --> 15:43.480]  These are drug addicts and they want the hit of wires in their brains and all of them
[15:43.480 --> 15:49.800]  have got those giant pupils because they've been there and they ain't coming back.
[15:49.800 --> 15:50.800]  That's what happens when you die.
[15:50.800 --> 15:56.160]  Your pupils open up and these guys are on hardcore drugs and I guarantee it's going to
[15:56.160 --> 15:57.160]  come out.
[15:57.160 --> 15:58.160]  They've got brain implants.
[15:58.160 --> 15:59.160]  Guaranteed.
[15:59.160 --> 16:02.080]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners.
[16:02.080 --> 16:06.760]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too
[16:06.760 --> 16:10.640]  crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[16:10.640 --> 16:14.520]  We'll hide here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on
[16:14.520 --> 16:19.080]  our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity
[16:19.080 --> 16:20.080]  off the grid.
[16:20.080 --> 16:24.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East
[16:24.000 --> 16:25.480]  Bank of the Mississippi.
[16:25.480 --> 16:29.320]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[16:29.320 --> 16:33.080]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[16:33.080 --> 16:37.440]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[16:37.440 --> 16:38.800]  So here's what you should do right now.
[16:38.800 --> 16:43.080]  Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[16:43.080 --> 16:45.280]  That's myownpowergrid.com.

[16:49.320 --> 16:50.320]  And the best part?
[16:50.320 --> 16:53.680]  You're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[16:53.680 --> 16:56.440]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[16:56.440 --> 16:59.360]  That's myownpowergrid.com.
[16:59.360 --> 17:04.360]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[17:04.360 --> 17:06.360]  may not be fully detected by you.
[17:06.360 --> 17:11.560]  But the symptoms are there, loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation
[17:11.560 --> 17:16.520]  and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[17:16.520 --> 17:21.040]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[17:21.040 --> 17:22.040]  across America.
[17:22.040 --> 17:26.040]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[17:26.040 --> 17:29.600]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much
[17:29.600 --> 17:30.600]  healthier I feel.
[17:30.600 --> 17:33.240]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[17:33.240 --> 17:38.440]  Only over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[17:38.440 --> 17:40.920]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[18:00.560 --> 18:05.440]  There are thousands of ideologies out there, hundreds of different political systems and
[18:05.440 --> 18:08.520]  most of them are funded by the globalist.
[18:08.520 --> 18:11.040]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[18:11.040 --> 18:14.560]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[18:14.560 --> 18:19.320]  I didn't invent all this, I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana and what really
[18:19.320 --> 18:23.920]  works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold it's super
[18:23.920 --> 18:26.840]  popular like it's always been.
[18:26.840 --> 18:30.840]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the
[18:30.840 --> 18:34.720]  light in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine.
[18:34.720 --> 18:39.240]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars by buying the great products
[18:39.240 --> 18:43.640]  at infowarsstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos and by praying for
[18:43.640 --> 18:48.240]  this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[18:48.240 --> 18:52.160]  For myself and the whole Infowars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've
[18:52.160 --> 18:56.120]  done because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[18:56.120 --> 19:00.240]  You are the Infowars and I salute you.
[19:00.240 --> 19:02.880]  It's happening now, right now.
[19:02.880 --> 19:07.400]  All over the world, humanity is fighting back against the transhumanist, globalist, world
[19:07.400 --> 19:12.840]  government, mark of the beast agenda and the forces of evil are trying to censor and suppress
[19:12.840 --> 19:15.400]  the tip of the spear, Infowars, more than ever.
[19:15.400 --> 19:21.720]  Well, we're doing a special 40 hour broadcast to get new projects we've developed up and
[19:21.720 --> 19:25.720]  into orbit and to take action at the next level.
[19:25.720 --> 19:29.840]  The globalists know we've already devastated them and they hope that you don't take action
[19:29.840 --> 19:33.040]  because when you support Infowars, you change the world.
[19:33.040 --> 19:38.640]  Find coverage at clownworld.us and at infowars.com forward slash show, but whatever you do, join
[19:38.640 --> 19:43.680]  us during the special 40 hour broadcast that's happening right now and spread the word because
[19:43.680 --> 19:48.200]  that's the real power to override the globalist and big tech censors.
[19:48.200 --> 19:53.000]  Again, infowars.com forward slash show or clownworld.us.
[19:53.000 --> 20:03.440]  Please take action.
[20:03.440 --> 20:33.280]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:33.280 --> 20:47.000]  Now, I've got to tell you, I can feel the energy across the planet as the life force
[20:47.000 --> 20:55.400]  of humanity begins to awaken and if you can see the anger in the forces of Satan, the
[20:55.400 --> 21:01.440]  globalists and how upset they are, it's because they can feel the life force and the destiny
[21:01.440 --> 21:05.800]  and they know they're going to lose and they know their world government's going to fail.
[21:05.800 --> 21:12.280]  They want to take as many of us as they can with them.
[21:12.280 --> 21:14.600]  Let me just give you a smattering of what's coming up.
[21:14.600 --> 21:19.720]  Again, we are three hours and 21 minutes into a 40 hour live global transmission.
[21:19.720 --> 21:23.640]  It will be a few hours overnight from like, you know, 2am to 5am or whatever where we
[21:23.640 --> 21:29.020]  run best of from the day and special reports and things, but we're going to have everybody
[21:29.020 --> 21:35.240]  here from Gavin McGinnis to Paul Joseph Watson to you name it and our reporters on the ground
[21:35.240 --> 21:38.360]  at the debates in Detroit.
[21:38.360 --> 21:47.200]  So that is all coming up tonight right through until Thursday at six o'clock when the war
[21:47.200 --> 21:48.200]  room ends.
[21:48.200 --> 21:53.360]  So we're going to be here right through, ladies and gentlemen, almost 48 hours, 40 hours
[21:53.360 --> 21:57.000]  of global live transmissions.
[21:57.000 --> 22:02.760]  Now that said, we don't want to preach to the choir here.
[22:02.760 --> 22:10.440]  And so it is essential, it is critical, it is paramount that all of you who are awesome
[22:10.440 --> 22:17.240]  remember that this is not a spectator sport, that word of mouth and human intelligence
[22:17.240 --> 22:21.720]  and human action in the third dimension but also in cyberspace can break people out of
[22:21.720 --> 22:27.160]  the digital gulags that are Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and the whole Google system that's
[22:27.160 --> 22:30.440]  working with the chai comms to suppress their population.
[22:30.440 --> 22:37.440]  And there's something really important I want to announce, but I'm not going to do it until
[22:37.440 --> 22:40.960]  the start of the next segment because I was running around managing things during the
[22:40.960 --> 22:45.120]  break, one reason I'm sweating again, running around between this building and the other
[22:45.120 --> 22:49.840]  and having a great time, you know, getting stuff together.
[22:49.840 --> 22:54.400]  But then I get back on air literally running in here as the music starts.
[22:54.400 --> 23:01.560]  And what I want to say is so important and so true, I want to be able to meditate or
[23:01.560 --> 23:05.440]  cogitate on it for a few minutes during this next break before I come on here and talk
[23:05.440 --> 23:09.800]  about it because it's just such incredibly good news.
[23:09.800 --> 23:15.040]  But with the good news comes the bad news, that when you knock the globalist upside
[23:15.040 --> 23:19.480]  the head, knock a couple of teeth out, they're going to come back up with a big old dagger
[23:19.480 --> 23:22.480]  in their hand for your guts and for my guts.
[23:22.480 --> 23:26.880]  So let's not lie to ourselves that there's not going to be some real pain in all this
[23:26.880 --> 23:27.880]  process.
[23:27.880 --> 23:31.880]  Let me tell you about some of what's coming up here today.
[23:31.880 --> 23:38.320]  And again, I'm not bragging, but the Democrats want us off air because nine times out of
[23:38.320 --> 23:40.520]  ten, we're the first to report something.
[23:40.520 --> 23:46.680]  I told you two years ago that we infiltrated Antifa here in Austin.
[23:46.680 --> 23:49.360]  I'm going to leave it at that.
[23:49.360 --> 23:51.800]  We recorded them, everything.
[23:51.800 --> 23:55.720]  And then I met with law enforcement who came to us.
[23:55.720 --> 23:56.720]  They knew we were there.
[23:56.720 --> 23:58.720]  I didn't know they were there.
[23:58.720 --> 23:59.800]  And they filled us in on it.
[23:59.800 --> 24:06.440]  The Communist Party Chinese at UT through the Confucian Club, our funding and running
[24:06.440 --> 24:07.440]  Antifa.
[24:07.440 --> 24:10.400]  And there are UT board members at these meetings.
[24:10.400 --> 24:11.640]  By the way, these are public.
[24:11.640 --> 24:17.120]  They don't announce them, but you can go into these.
[24:17.120 --> 24:21.200]  You notice about a year after I told you that, the Homeland Security got involved and the
[24:21.200 --> 24:24.360]  UT suspended the Confucian Club.
[24:24.360 --> 24:25.600]  Now that was not our investigation.
[24:25.600 --> 24:31.540]  The state police and the U.S. Army were already in the meetings.
[24:31.540 --> 24:33.480]  And then they were obviously tracking everybody that attended.
[24:33.480 --> 24:38.200]  And then I got a visit saying, you know, you're welcome to come to these events or whatever,
[24:38.200 --> 24:40.960]  but you need to know we're already watching them.
[24:40.960 --> 24:46.640]  So that's what's going on here.
[24:46.640 --> 24:51.620]  So had other military folks give me briefings on the child kidnapping rings and operations
[24:51.620 --> 24:56.040]  going on a few months after that.
[24:56.040 --> 24:58.160]  And I'm not tooting horns here.
[24:58.160 --> 25:04.080]  It's that you need to understand we're not making this stuff up because now look at the
[25:04.080 --> 25:09.840]  news, Trump's looking at declaring Antifa terrorist organization.
[25:09.840 --> 25:10.840]  Why is that?
[25:10.840 --> 25:14.240]  Well, here's the definition of terrorism.
[25:14.240 --> 25:20.120]  Terrorism is the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population
[25:20.120 --> 25:24.640]  and hereby and thereby bring about a particular political objective.
[25:24.640 --> 25:28.520]  Terrorism has been practiced by political organizations with both rightist and leftist
[25:28.520 --> 25:35.320]  objectives, by nationalistic and religious groups, by revolutionaries and even by state
[25:35.320 --> 25:39.640]  institutions such as armies, intelligence agencies and police.
[25:39.640 --> 25:47.160]  Now, we learned two years ago that Antifa was preparing to target people's homes during
[25:47.160 --> 25:54.760]  an uprising and kill conservative nationalist government officials, law enforcement personnel,
[25:54.760 --> 25:56.600]  leadership and talk show host.
[25:56.600 --> 25:58.040]  You've now seen them go to the houses.
[25:58.040 --> 26:01.560]  You've seen them say, next we're going to come to your house and kill you.
[26:01.560 --> 26:02.560]  Tomorrow's news today.
[26:02.560 --> 26:04.680]  We're not just saying all this.
[26:04.680 --> 26:09.480]  What did Lester Holt and all of them get so freaked out about and say we've got to ban
[26:09.480 --> 26:13.680]  Alex Jones off Twitter last year, about a month after I got banned off everything else.
[26:13.680 --> 26:17.040]  They said, Alex Jones says, get battle rifles and go kill the media.
[26:17.040 --> 26:18.040]  Never said that.
[26:18.040 --> 26:19.040]  It's made up.
[26:19.040 --> 26:22.240]  It was an emergency message to the president that they knew the president had actually
[26:22.240 --> 26:23.240]  watched.
[26:23.240 --> 26:26.600]  He watched it, actually got word that night and watched it.
[26:26.600 --> 26:31.120]  He says, when he's got messages, try to get them to me.
[26:31.120 --> 26:37.200]  And they were shaking all over the national news, every channel, every channel interviewing
[26:37.200 --> 26:39.560]  the head of Twitter saying he's coming to kill us.
[26:39.560 --> 26:42.880]  No, wait, because a lot of the media dresses up at night as Antifa.
[26:42.880 --> 26:43.880]  So I didn't say go out and kill the media.
[26:43.880 --> 26:46.480]  I said, if Antifa comes to your house, you need to be ready.
[26:46.480 --> 26:51.360]  You need to have your battle rifle ready.
[26:51.360 --> 26:55.600]  Because if they start trying to come in your house, they said they're coming to kill you.
[26:55.600 --> 26:58.360]  Totally legal, totally lawful.
[26:58.360 --> 27:04.640]  We also then learned they're planning to kill border patrol agents.
[27:04.640 --> 27:06.480]  And that's come out.
[27:06.480 --> 27:13.560]  Well now, Antifa Group plans border resistance tour to subvert immigration enforcement.
[27:13.560 --> 27:18.040]  Coalition of leftists and Antifa, all funded by George Soros's son, we got the secret documents.
[27:18.040 --> 27:24.880]  Link groups are planning a new 10-day tour meant to directly challenge immigration law
[27:24.880 --> 27:29.120]  enforcement at the U.S.-Mexico border and throughout the homeland.
[27:29.120 --> 27:33.000]  So that's an internal group trying to break the borders with the UN funding, the refugee
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.600]  centers and the invasion force.
[27:34.600 --> 27:38.080]  The Democrats say it didn't exist so we wouldn't get border funding, wouldn't even have the
[27:38.080 --> 27:41.440]  facilities, breaking down the courts, breaking down everything.
[27:41.440 --> 27:45.400]  And now they're like, oh, it is a crisis and it's Trump's fault.
[27:45.400 --> 27:50.680]  While they now send their paramilitary down to the border and take over ICE facilities
[27:50.680 --> 27:55.760]  and run up Mexican flags, that was the Aurora City Council leading a group of mainly white
[27:55.760 --> 28:01.160]  people and a bunch of illegal aliens to cheer and yell and pull down the American flag and
[28:01.160 --> 28:02.320]  run up the Mexican flag.
[28:02.320 --> 28:05.200]  This is the operating system.
[28:05.200 --> 28:08.600]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[28:08.600 --> 28:12.360]  So that's one of the big news items that I pretty much just covered, but this is a big
[28:12.360 --> 28:13.360]  deal.
[28:13.360 --> 28:18.480]  In Portland, Oregon Mayor Moles Masked Ban as Trump threatens terrorist designations
[28:18.480 --> 28:19.480]  for Antifa.
[28:19.480 --> 28:21.920]  You'll learn the mayor's running it in that city.
[28:21.920 --> 28:27.920]  They are consortium of government employees, media, university operatives and then meth
[28:27.920 --> 28:32.840]  head criminals that they pay $10 an hour to come out and be their muscle.
[28:32.840 --> 28:33.840]  That's who they are.
[28:33.840 --> 28:35.840]  That's what none of them talk.
[28:35.840 --> 28:36.840]  They're not allowed to.
[28:36.840 --> 28:39.000]  They're told, you keep your mouth shut.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.800]  But who's running it is the Chinese government.
[28:41.800 --> 28:46.480]  And believe me, the Pentagon, everybody knows this is the best the Chi Combs can offer.
[28:46.480 --> 28:50.320]  How about you dirty scum that beat up women and children?
[28:50.320 --> 28:53.320]  Well, if we're so cucked we let them run this country.
[28:53.320 --> 28:54.320]  We deserve what happens.
[28:54.320 --> 28:59.320]  Stay with us.
[28:59.320 --> 29:03.240]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector

[29:14.600 --> 29:17.920]  leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[29:17.920 --> 29:21.800]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is
[29:21.800 --> 29:25.920]  in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[29:25.920 --> 29:30.440]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale
[29:30.440 --> 29:36.480]  leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account
[29:36.480 --> 29:37.480]  each month.

[29:52.800 --> 29:55.240]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals
[29:55.240 --> 30:00.320]  before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[30:00.320 --> 30:01.320]  David Knight here.
[30:01.320 --> 30:06.000]  You can join me every Monday through Friday at 9 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Central Time for the
[30:06.000 --> 30:07.400]  David Knight Show.

[30:11.920 --> 30:18.320]  news, will give you the background, the context behind that news from a perspective that values
[30:18.320 --> 30:19.840]  our God-given liberties.
[30:19.840 --> 30:24.040]  We're going to take a look at those who want to do a detour around our Constitution, those
[30:24.040 --> 30:28.320]  who want to deconstruct our culture and destroy our civilization.
[30:28.320 --> 30:33.720]  So make sure you join us every Monday through Friday again, 9 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Central
[30:33.720 --> 30:34.720]  Time.

[30:43.920 --> 30:47.840]  of those places again, 9 a.m. Eastern, 8 a.m. Central Time.
[30:47.840 --> 30:52.280]  Again, don't forget to tune in to the David Knight Show on infowars.com forward slash
[30:52.280 --> 31:18.360]  david-night-show.
[31:22.280 --> 31:29.840]  The globalists know we've already devastated them and they hope that you don't take action
[31:29.840 --> 31:33.040]  because when you support infowars, you change the world.
[31:33.040 --> 31:38.640]  Find coverage at clownworld.us and at infowars.com forward slash show, but whatever you do, join
[31:38.640 --> 31:43.680]  us during the special 40 hour broadcast that's happening right now and spread the word because
[31:43.680 --> 31:48.040]  that's the real power to override the globalist and big tech sensors.
[31:48.040 --> 32:00.280]  Again, infowars.com forward slash show, our clownworld.us please take action.
[32:00.280 --> 32:05.640]  Before I started working at infowars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and infowars.com
[32:05.640 --> 32:10.200]  but also the products at infowarsstore.com and there's one product that's offered at
[32:10.200 --> 32:15.600]  infowarsstore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's DNA Force Plus.
[32:15.600 --> 32:20.040]  Now I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[32:20.040 --> 32:23.400]  telomeres and telomere support with your DNA.
[32:23.400 --> 32:28.280]  So I started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how it can improve
[32:28.280 --> 32:31.800]  your health and longevity when you protect your telomeres.
[32:31.800 --> 32:35.240]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus but it's expensive.
[32:35.240 --> 32:36.240]  Why?
[32:36.240 --> 32:38.360]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[32:38.360 --> 32:42.320]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[32:42.320 --> 32:48.680]  telomere support and they came and they went but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[32:48.680 --> 32:50.160]  It is the elite supplement.
[32:50.160 --> 32:54.960]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive so you should
[32:54.960 --> 33:02.880]  take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at infowarsstore.com.
[33:02.880 --> 33:19.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:19.040 --> 33:26.320]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over
[33:26.320 --> 33:28.720]  the mind of man.
[33:28.720 --> 33:34.880]  Thomas Jefferson, if you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:34.880 --> 33:39.800]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:39.800 --> 34:02.560]  Once she was wonderful, once she was fine, once she was beautiful, once she was mine.
[34:02.560 --> 34:12.200]  The globalist want to capture the idea that the United States stood for, true human empowerment.
[34:12.200 --> 34:14.240]  We're the country that empowered women.
[34:14.240 --> 34:19.000]  We're the country with England starting it, freeing the slaves.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.880]  We're the country that stood up against the Nazis.
[34:21.880 --> 34:25.320]  We're the country that invented most of the technology, most of it.
[34:25.320 --> 34:30.560]  We're the country whose designs and style and systems have been adopted all over the
[34:30.560 --> 34:37.600]  world because imitation is the most sincere form of flattering.
[34:37.600 --> 34:45.240]  But because we have a Christian ethos and a Christian consciousness, we can be lied
[34:45.240 --> 34:47.000]  to by the accuser.
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.480]  That's what the Bible calls Satan.
[34:49.480 --> 34:55.000]  The accuser and Satan will come to God's people and tell them how they're bad and how they're
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.760]  not good and how they're not righteous.
[34:57.760 --> 35:02.800]  Because we are righteous, we feel bad, you're right, I am dirty, I am a sinner.
[35:02.800 --> 35:09.000]  Well, that's for God to tell you and convict your heart, not Satan.
[35:09.000 --> 35:13.800]  You're not going to be perfect in this fight, ladies and gentlemen, but whenever you feel
[35:13.800 --> 35:17.800]  like, oh, I'm not good enough, I'm not strong enough to fight evil, that's a lie of the
[35:17.800 --> 35:18.800]  devil.
[35:18.800 --> 35:23.360]  Now, I want to take a victory lap for all the listeners and all the viewers because
[35:23.360 --> 35:28.000]  this isn't a pat on the head, this isn't me being patronizing.
[35:28.000 --> 35:34.400]  I don't want to be at the White House to feel like I've arrived and oh, I'm there and we
[35:34.400 --> 35:38.200]  put Trump in office, we were the launchpad.
[35:38.200 --> 35:42.360]  I'm not upset that I didn't get invited to the White House event, they brought the people
[35:42.360 --> 35:47.520]  that were safe there to show the world, hey, these are human beings, don't censor them.
[35:47.520 --> 35:51.200]  Not giving them people the media had already demonized so they could project that under
[35:51.200 --> 35:52.200]  the whole group.
[35:52.200 --> 35:58.200]  I agree, I shouldn't have been there and I don't want to be there.
[35:58.200 --> 36:05.520]  I get snuck through the tunnel at midnight, that's when people like me need to be there.
[36:05.520 --> 36:10.920]  You see, we start the revolutions, we execute the revolutions, we command the revolutions
[36:10.920 --> 36:18.080]  and the fact that the president tries to support and show solidarity for a bunch of
[36:18.080 --> 36:22.680]  great patriots is a good thing.
[36:22.680 --> 36:29.600]  But ladies and gentlemen, we, with our guest and your support, expose Jeffrey Epstein.
[36:29.600 --> 36:34.600]  We exposed the Franklin Cover-Up, we exposed Bohemian Grove, we exposed all of it and it
[36:34.600 --> 36:41.600]  wasn't because I was an expert, it was because former high-level FBI agents, former retired
[36:41.600 --> 36:52.080]  top generals, former CIA death squad commanders, like John DeKamp, Senator John DeKamp, told
[36:52.080 --> 37:01.720]  me all this and he might have let death squads kill thousands of himself with his own hands
[37:01.720 --> 37:05.920]  in Operation Phoenix, Phoenix program, but he sure as hell didn't rape kids.
[37:05.920 --> 37:11.560]  There's a certain point, like my uncle told me, because he was in Vietnam at that same
[37:11.560 --> 37:16.520]  time and then Guatemala and other areas for the Army covertly after Vietnam for a long
[37:16.520 --> 37:17.520]  time.
[37:17.520 --> 37:21.120]  You know those Army units that you're playing clothes that are never out of the Army.
[37:21.120 --> 37:25.360]  He said, they'll always come a time when the evil becomes so great, you finally say
[37:25.360 --> 37:26.640]  no or join with it.
[37:26.640 --> 37:28.760]  And I remember saying to him, what was it?
[37:28.760 --> 37:32.760]  He said, the children, and it was all classified, he couldn't tell you, he just said the children.
[37:32.760 --> 37:36.240]  He goes, you know, it's a guest on your show.
[37:36.240 --> 37:42.120]  People running this show kill children, they don't just rape them, Alex, they kill them.
[37:42.120 --> 37:45.920]  Most of the guys he knew were involved in all sorts of wild stuff in Vietnam.
[37:45.920 --> 37:50.160]  Let's just say, not very Christian, but let me tell you, they got Jesus real quick when
[37:50.160 --> 37:53.880]  they found out at the bottom of the rat hole was Satan and like, oh, you guys have a lot
[37:53.880 --> 37:55.840]  of wild stuff in Vietnam, you're our kind of killers.
[37:55.840 --> 37:57.440]  You know, we're really Satanists, right?
[37:57.440 --> 37:59.960]  And they're like, no, we're not Satanists like you.
[37:59.960 --> 38:04.160]  They all got Jesus real quick.
[38:04.160 --> 38:10.520]  So at the bottom of the rat hole, ladies and gentlemen, everybody better decide which side
[38:10.520 --> 38:12.160]  they're on.
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.200]  You're on Satan's side or you're on God's side.
[38:15.200 --> 38:17.960]  That's all there is.
[38:17.960 --> 38:23.160]  It's real.
[38:23.160 --> 38:32.120]  Dennis Haster was taken as a high school wrestling coach from nowhere and run by the Republican
[38:32.120 --> 38:36.400]  establishment and within just a few years of being in the house, he was made the speaker
[38:36.400 --> 38:43.120]  because he was a compromised criminal who controlled stables of young boys as young
[38:43.120 --> 38:47.040]  as 11 years old for members of Congress to have sex with them.
[38:47.040 --> 38:53.480]  Remember Barney Frank had a three story building in Georgetown DC about 10 years ago, you can
[38:53.480 --> 38:54.480]  find the clip.
[38:54.480 --> 38:55.480]  They've expunged it off YouTube.
[38:55.480 --> 38:56.480]  You can find it.
[38:56.480 --> 38:57.480]  We've got it somewhere.
[38:57.480 --> 39:03.120]  He gets on the floor of the house and the FBI had raided his house and raided the pimps
[39:03.120 --> 39:09.760]  or had a whole stable of 13, 14 and 15 year old boys that they were in there running a
[39:09.760 --> 39:14.720]  brothel for the Republican and Democratic parties.
[39:14.720 --> 39:19.040]  You remember what Barney Frank got up on the house floor, he said, listen to me.
[39:19.040 --> 39:24.040]  He said, you keep this investigation going, a bunch of you in this chamber have been at
[39:24.040 --> 39:29.680]  my house and you do one more thing, your names are all getting named and they all stuck their
[39:29.680 --> 39:32.240]  tails between their legs and pissed themselves.
[39:32.240 --> 39:33.520]  Well, guess what?
[39:33.520 --> 39:40.680]  Trump hadn't been having sex with any children and he's clean when it comes to that.
[39:40.680 --> 39:44.880]  Did Trump obviously pay off the mafia a thousand times to build buildings in this country?
[39:44.880 --> 39:51.200]  Yeah, that's what you do in New York, but nothing hurting children.
[39:51.200 --> 39:55.840]  That's how business gets done and they're pissed because he's not in the club where
[39:55.840 --> 40:02.120]  you've been little boys over.
[40:02.120 --> 40:05.480]  So I want to tell the globalist something.
[40:05.480 --> 40:13.920]  You have failed and you have failed miserably in full wars is more authoritative, more powerful
[40:13.920 --> 40:18.080]  with who we reach that it's ever been you fail.
[40:18.080 --> 40:24.880]  Senator Blumenthal to protect Hillary and all the scum you fail monster.
[40:24.880 --> 40:30.240]  Senator Murphy, you fail monster, Hillary Clinton, you fail monster, Bill Clinton,
[40:30.240 --> 40:40.280]  you fail monster, Chuck E. Schumer and Uba Abedin and her pedophile husband, you fail.
[40:40.280 --> 40:45.720]  You're failing on all fronts and the apprehension and conviction of pedophiles, not just child
[40:45.720 --> 40:46.720]  porn is up 12-fold.
[40:46.720 --> 40:47.720]  It was 10-fold.
[40:47.720 --> 40:53.680]  I looked it up last night, 12-fold under Trump, your whole empire that's taken over the Catholic
[40:53.680 --> 41:00.400]  Church and everything else, major universities, Penn State, you name it, is coming to an end.
[41:00.400 --> 41:02.040]  See most of these people aren't even pedophiles.
[41:02.040 --> 41:04.320]  They've got to have sex with a kid as the initiation.
[41:04.320 --> 41:08.680]  That's what some of these fraternities will have sex with a goat and the next it's a kid
[41:08.680 --> 41:09.680]  once you're out of college.
[41:09.680 --> 41:11.960]  It's all the same stuff.
[41:11.960 --> 41:13.460]  It's compromising people.
[41:13.460 --> 41:20.440]  First it's a 16-year-old girl, then it's a 14-year-old girl, then oh, this girl O.D.
[41:20.440 --> 41:26.720]  at the party, she didn't know D, they killed her, I was one shot.
[41:26.720 --> 41:31.440]  Stanley Kubrick died for what he knew.
[41:31.440 --> 41:33.160]  I know the secrets.
[41:33.160 --> 41:41.640]  I've been told the secrets directly by his protege, Vivian Kubrick, but I already knew.
[41:41.640 --> 41:45.600]  So they have failed and they're going to keep failing and everything we've talked about
[41:45.600 --> 41:48.320]  is now out in the open and they don't know what to do and that's a beautiful thing.
[41:48.320 --> 41:52.160]  So let me tell you, listeners, you're the reason we're here.
[41:52.160 --> 41:55.640]  Everything you've done, spreading the word, being laughed at, being ridiculed, purchasing
[41:55.640 --> 42:02.200]  the products, supporting local radio stations, all of that has made this possible.
[42:02.200 --> 42:05.280]  So when the left calls up some local station and threatens them, they only get that one
[42:05.280 --> 42:11.240]  call from the left, they've got 100 calls from you, they've got 100 bucks in the mail
[42:11.240 --> 42:13.720]  and we're running a money bomb where I need to raise a million dollars.
[42:13.720 --> 42:14.720]  Sounds like a lot.
[42:14.720 --> 42:15.720]  It's not.
[42:15.720 --> 42:20.600]  The big media gets, you know, Vox can't even have our reach, it gets 250 million a year.
[42:20.600 --> 42:25.320]  Couple billions have been paid out to Vice TV the last few years by HBO to promote pedophilia.
[42:25.320 --> 42:28.400]  You name it, they're going bankrupt.
[42:28.400 --> 42:33.600]  We sell 30-something million dollars with the product a year, 15 million, 20 million to
[42:33.600 --> 42:34.600]  run this whole place.
[42:34.600 --> 42:35.600]  It's nothing.
[42:35.600 --> 42:39.520]  So when I say I have a million dollar goal the next 40 hours, a million of gross sales
[42:39.520 --> 42:45.920]  and straight donations at infowars.com forward slash show or infowarshore.com, we'll probably
[42:45.920 --> 42:46.920]  make $300,000 or $400,000.
[42:46.920 --> 42:48.520]  We need that to go to next launch phase.
[42:48.520 --> 42:50.520]  Why is it a space shuttle?
[42:50.520 --> 42:53.880]  I'll explain why it's a space shuttle and then hit other big news on the other side.
[42:53.880 --> 42:55.040]  It's the perfect metaphor.
[42:55.040 --> 42:57.800]  We come back, please spread the word and stay with us.
[42:57.800 --> 42:58.800]  Thank you.
[42:58.800 --> 43:01.880]  Robert Barnes, what has Big Tech become?
[43:01.880 --> 43:04.960]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because
[43:04.960 --> 43:09.400]  they face no consequence of social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities
[43:09.400 --> 43:10.400]  over two decades.
[43:10.400 --> 43:13.760]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the members of the
[43:13.760 --> 43:17.080]  independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the
[43:17.080 --> 43:21.360]  audience that care about this has to bring real social, political, economic consequence
[43:21.360 --> 43:22.360]  to their course of conduct.
[43:22.360 --> 43:26.200]  Otherwise, they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs, the equivalent
[43:26.200 --> 43:30.160]  to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran American economy
[43:30.160 --> 43:33.560]  almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[43:33.560 --> 43:38.560]  The infowars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world to
[43:38.560 --> 43:42.880]  make real the actions of independent free speech, to make real the original promise
[43:42.880 --> 43:44.400]  of an independent free press.
[43:44.400 --> 43:48.160]  Real collusion is Big Tech and big media manipulating and working with each other to
[43:48.160 --> 43:50.880]  try to meddle with elections, to try to shake people's thoughts.
[43:50.880 --> 43:53.880]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[43:53.880 --> 43:55.720]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting.
[43:55.720 --> 43:57.640]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[43:57.640 --> 43:59.560]  Even it is what you just saw.
[43:59.560 --> 44:06.080]  As we witness the most disastrous geological activity in recorded history, the globalists
[44:06.080 --> 44:11.120]  are backed into a corner and the leftists are pushing for civil war.
[44:11.120 --> 44:14.880]  Borders are being broken and sovereignty is being challenged.
[44:14.880 --> 44:21.800]  The world is going to change and how it changes will likely be decided by those who are prepared
[44:21.800 --> 44:25.000]  to stay strong when the system fails.
[44:25.000 --> 44:31.160]  The system is vulnerable, electricity could be gone in an instant and grocery stores could
[44:31.160 --> 44:33.520]  be empty in three days.
[44:33.520 --> 44:38.800]  Buying storeable foods and the ability to purify water will give you a fighting chance
[44:38.800 --> 44:44.440]  in the next level and being without puts you at the mercy of others or makes you a slave
[44:44.440 --> 44:46.200]  to a dying system.
[44:46.200 --> 44:51.720]  Buy storeable foods and an Alexa pure gravity water filter today.
[44:51.720 --> 45:00.640]  Support mankind by being prepared and support freedom by buying from InfowarsStore.com.
[45:00.640 --> 45:06.120]  What's happening now, right now, all over the world humanity is fighting back against
[45:06.120 --> 45:11.240]  the transhumanist, globalist, world government, mark of the beast agenda.
[45:11.240 --> 45:15.160]  The forces of evil are trying to censor and suppress the tip of the spear, Infowars, more
[45:15.160 --> 45:16.160]  than ever.
[45:16.160 --> 45:22.120]  Well, we're doing a special 40 hour broadcast to get new projects we've developed up and
[45:22.120 --> 45:26.120]  into orbit and to take action at the next level.
[45:26.120 --> 45:30.240]  The globalists now we've already devastated them and they hope that you don't take action
[45:30.240 --> 45:33.440]  because when you support Infowars, you change the world.
[45:33.440 --> 45:39.040]  Find coverage at clownworld.us and at infowars.com forward slash show, but whatever you do, join
[45:39.040 --> 45:44.080]  us during the special 40 hour broadcast that's happening right now and spread the word because
[45:44.080 --> 45:48.520]  that's the real power to override the globalist and big tech censors.
[45:48.520 --> 45:53.400]  Again, infowars.com forward slash show or clownworld.us.
[45:53.400 --> 46:01.400]  Let's take action.
[46:01.400 --> 46:05.400]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people, but I decided that we're
[46:05.400 --> 46:09.000]  going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back five, six years ago
[46:09.000 --> 46:12.520]  before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits, the rest of it, I would talk about
[46:12.520 --> 46:16.200]  how great the products are and how they were the best and why they were and I'd have doctors
[46:16.200 --> 46:18.080]  on an experts to explain why they were so good.
[46:18.080 --> 46:21.480]  And instead the last few years, I'm like, Hey, we need to really support us or they'll
[46:21.480 --> 46:24.240]  shut us down. The biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how
[46:24.240 --> 46:25.840]  great they are and how wonderful they work.
[46:25.840 --> 46:27.600]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[46:27.600 --> 46:31.920]  Jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements.
[46:31.920 --> 46:37.280]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the
[46:37.280 --> 46:39.920]  FDA because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[46:39.920 --> 46:43.800]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the
[46:43.800 --> 46:47.400]  system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature and manipulate it and do different things.
[46:47.400 --> 46:48.680]  And a lot of drugs work great.
[46:48.680 --> 46:52.640]  They have side effects not with Mother Nature, but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about
[46:52.640 --> 46:58.840]  God's medicine chest info or store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one,
[46:58.840 --> 47:03.920]  three, nine.
[47:03.920 --> 47:29.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:29.480 --> 47:41.760]  47 minutes into the 40 hour emergency broadcast that we're doing at info wars.com forward
[47:41.760 --> 47:42.760]  slash show.
[47:42.760 --> 47:45.040]  We'll go right through today, right through tomorrow.
[47:45.040 --> 47:52.680]  And within that, we're going to have Clown World coverage July 30th to the 31st, starting
[47:52.680 --> 47:59.440]  at 8am today and every night at seven o'clock central, we'll have the special coverage.
[47:59.440 --> 48:04.720]  Tonight, tomorrow night of the debate, the hour before, during the debate, and then after
[48:04.720 --> 48:06.000]  the debate.
[48:06.000 --> 48:07.960]  We have Gavin McGinnis joining us next hour.
[48:07.960 --> 48:11.440]  They'll also be popping in after the debate tonight.
[48:11.440 --> 48:17.880]  Paul Joseph Watson coming up, Owen Schreuer, Will Johnson, David Knight, Robert Barnes
[48:17.880 --> 48:18.880]  is here.
[48:18.880 --> 48:19.880]  He's going to be in studio.
[48:19.880 --> 48:22.920]  By the way, I've gotten calls and stuff like, oh my gosh, Robert Barnes lost his lawsuit
[48:22.920 --> 48:27.240]  against the Covington, you know, you know, harassers.
[48:27.240 --> 48:30.160]  No, that's the other law firm.
[48:30.160 --> 48:32.480]  He hasn't filed his yet.
[48:32.480 --> 48:37.560]  And he privately told me a lot of stuff about how that was going to get dismissed and how
[48:37.560 --> 48:41.360]  it was kind of low down what was happening.
[48:41.360 --> 48:45.800]  I don't know if he'll say all that on air, but the point is he represents a bunch of
[48:45.800 --> 48:48.960]  folks, he's not yet filed the suits because they have two years to do it, but they're
[48:48.960 --> 48:51.080]  getting very close.
[48:51.080 --> 48:52.360]  We're getting ready to file suits.
[48:52.360 --> 48:55.760]  We're about a month behind, but it should happen the next few weeks.
[48:55.760 --> 49:00.200]  Our own suits, we're not litigious, but we have to do it, so let me get to the point
[49:00.200 --> 49:03.760]  I was making last segment before I had all this other news, and I tend to open the phones
[49:03.760 --> 49:05.920]  up throughout the day, throughout the night as well.
[49:05.920 --> 49:08.480]  So thanks for joining us.
[49:08.480 --> 49:13.640]  Why for this 40 hour special money bomb, can we pull the graphics up for the money bomb
[49:13.640 --> 49:14.640]  please?
[49:14.640 --> 49:17.400]  They're at infowars.com forward slash show.
[49:17.400 --> 49:23.080]  Why am I using the graphic of a space shuttle?
[49:23.080 --> 49:27.160]  Why am I doing that?
[49:27.160 --> 49:32.640]  Well because the space shuttle is the perfect analogy or symbol for this.
[49:32.640 --> 49:37.680]  It was meant to build space stations for habitations for humans.
[49:37.680 --> 49:41.400]  It was meant to service those facilities.
[49:41.400 --> 49:47.840]  It was originally meant to be a orbital atomic bomb attack craft by the Nazis, but the U.S.
[49:47.840 --> 49:54.720]  got the designs and upgraded it, but the point is our use for it was to build earth habitations,
[49:54.720 --> 50:00.120]  earthling habitations in space, which symbolizes a pro-human future.
[50:00.120 --> 50:04.320]  Now it got taken over by the military and 80% of its missions were secret, hundreds
[50:04.320 --> 50:09.760]  and hundreds of them, and in those missions they would open up the big pod bay doors and
[50:09.760 --> 50:13.920]  they would deploy secret satellites and weapons systems and things like that.
[50:13.920 --> 50:19.520]  So we want to raise a million dollars gross sales, or straight donations are great because
[50:19.520 --> 50:23.880]  then we get 95% of the money instead of half or whatever.
[50:23.880 --> 50:27.400]  Some of these discounts are so big we might make it 20% on the products because we have
[50:27.400 --> 50:28.400]  store-wide free shipping.
[50:28.400 --> 50:33.040]  I should have said that at the start of the show, and we have 50% off all the supplements.
[50:33.040 --> 50:36.080]  Some things are even more off, so I need to kind of go over those lists for you.
[50:36.080 --> 50:38.280]  I haven't done that yet, but I want to just explain.
[50:38.280 --> 50:43.480]  The symbol of the space shuttle means a pro-human type 1 civilization, meaning if the earth
[50:43.480 --> 50:45.280]  was destroyed, humanity would still survive.
[50:45.280 --> 50:53.240]  So it's the next big giant step for humanity that was talked about by Neil Armstrong.
[50:53.240 --> 50:55.920]  And they always lie about me and say that I said the moon landing didn't happen, I never
[50:55.920 --> 50:56.920]  said that.
[50:56.920 --> 51:00.960]  And so it's another reason for me to just get out front on that and to have them stop
[51:00.960 --> 51:02.120]  saying that.
[51:02.120 --> 51:04.520]  If you don't want to believe it, that's fine.
[51:04.520 --> 51:08.240]  I know people like Raymond Tigg that was on Mission Control 1, he's on the videos, he's
[51:08.240 --> 51:13.880]  on the video, he ran the RCA cameras on the moon.
[51:13.880 --> 51:15.000]  Why is it all grainy?
[51:15.000 --> 51:21.200]  Because it's radio signal, a TV signal back to earth, but he ran those.
[51:21.200 --> 51:22.200]  It's real.
[51:22.200 --> 51:27.160]  And hydrogen bombs are real, and cell phones are real, and satellites are real, and all
[51:27.160 --> 51:28.600]  this technology is real.
[51:28.600 --> 51:29.600]  Human cloning is happening.
[51:29.600 --> 51:32.200]  It's all going on.
[51:32.200 --> 51:33.560]  And we're exponentially advancing.
[51:33.560 --> 51:40.560]  So it's the symbol of the space shuttle going up into space with a payload, because I told
[51:40.560 --> 51:44.640]  you we're doing a lot of things behind the scenes because we've been quote, de-platformed.
[51:44.640 --> 51:49.120]  A lot of other projects, a lot of other people were supporting, a lot of other people that
[51:49.120 --> 51:50.120]  were financing.
[51:50.120 --> 51:55.320]  In many cases, no strings attached, but having huge effects.
[51:55.320 --> 52:01.120]  And so inside that space shuttle at infowars.com forward slash show, where you can donate or
[52:01.120 --> 52:07.800]  buy products, or infowars.com, it all goes the same place.
[52:07.800 --> 52:20.880]  You're funding what's inside of the space shuttle that the enemy wants to not be deployed.
[52:20.880 --> 52:24.560]  And believe me, I've got a bunch of really great projects that are already launched that
[52:24.560 --> 52:25.840]  I can't tell you about.
[52:25.840 --> 52:29.720]  I've got other projects that are about to be launched, and no matter what happens to
[52:29.720 --> 52:34.200]  me they're being launched, and I'm expending all capital I have.
[52:34.200 --> 52:38.200]  And we're not launching escape pods to keep using the space analogy here.
[52:38.200 --> 52:39.680]  We're launching new ships.
[52:39.680 --> 52:40.880]  We're launching new devices.
[52:40.880 --> 52:43.560]  We're launching new operations.
[52:43.560 --> 52:49.520]  And it's already been successful, but I mean, if we raise $400,000 of actual profit out
[52:49.520 --> 52:54.400]  of this to fund the operation, that's nothing compared to what big media has.
[52:54.400 --> 53:00.200]  The New York Times, what costs like $500 million to run a year or something?
[53:00.200 --> 53:01.200]  It's ridiculous.
[53:01.200 --> 53:03.520]  Or maybe it loses $500 million a year.
[53:03.520 --> 53:07.400]  Check my memory on that, how much it costs to run the New York Times a year.
[53:07.400 --> 53:08.400]  It's astronomical.
[53:08.400 --> 53:14.040]  Or again, just these sites like Vox, $250 million a year, and that's pure money from
[53:14.040 --> 53:17.760]  George Soros and NBC and Disney.
[53:17.760 --> 53:23.120]  A billion a year to vice television, and it's all collapsing, and it's having no effect.
[53:23.120 --> 53:29.720]  We're changing the world, putting out countervailing ideas and information to the globalist narrative
[53:29.720 --> 53:33.440]  and saying, no, it's not racist to say Democrat cities are falling apart and have rats everywhere
[53:33.440 --> 53:36.120]  and are crap holes, and the Democrats skim the money and steal it.
[53:36.120 --> 53:37.120]  Everybody knows that.
[53:37.120 --> 53:39.040]  They're constantly getting caught.
[53:39.040 --> 53:42.160]  Trump's calling them out for trying to open the borders and saying that the border patrol
[53:42.160 --> 53:44.200]  are Nazis and we treat children terrible.
[53:44.200 --> 53:49.520]  Meanwhile, Elijah Cummings District is an absolutely collapsed hell pit with basic services not
[53:49.520 --> 53:55.360]  even arriving like police or fire or pest control or garbage pickup because the government's
[53:55.360 --> 54:00.080]  stealing all the money.
[54:00.080 --> 54:04.520]  It's totally true what the president said, but see, because it's so true because we're
[54:04.520 --> 54:09.280]  taking care of everybody moving in across the border, oh, we're Nazis, and oh, because
[54:09.280 --> 54:12.960]  Democrats are sucking off their own people and stealing all the money for services like
[54:12.960 --> 54:14.240]  they always do.
[54:14.240 --> 54:19.840]  Oh, Trump's racist because they have to change the subject.
[54:19.840 --> 54:23.240]  They have to do it, ladies and gentlemen, because there's nothing else that they can
[54:23.240 --> 54:25.240]  do.
[54:25.240 --> 54:35.600]  Now, we're countering these individuals, and we've proven that we are delivering on
[54:35.600 --> 54:36.600]  every front.
[54:36.600 --> 54:41.280]  And if you want to see the next 100 big stories we break first, if you want to see Project
[54:41.280 --> 54:47.800]  Veritas and all the other groups that we have on that we magnify and that we support, all
[54:47.800 --> 54:52.000]  these other groups do great work, but there's really never any support for us when we're
[54:52.000 --> 54:53.000]  under attack.
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.000]  That's okay.
[54:54.000 --> 54:59.120]  We are all about leadership here, and we're here to incubate and help and support all
[54:59.120 --> 55:04.600]  the other organizations and all the other groups and all the other assets to a pro-human
[55:04.600 --> 55:05.600]  future.
[55:05.600 --> 55:07.440]  That's what it's all about.
[55:07.440 --> 55:12.880]  It's not about info wars getting bigger and bigger and more powerful, it's about defeating
[55:12.880 --> 55:13.880]  the NWO.
[55:13.880 --> 55:21.600]  It's about taking their corrupt, evil, anti-human, let's kill babies after their born system.
[55:21.600 --> 55:24.400]  And so that's why I'm so proud of what this team's done, why I'm so proud of what you've
[55:24.400 --> 55:31.160]  done, and all the successes you've witnessed, all the successes that you've seen have been
[55:31.160 --> 55:38.640]  because of the actions of this crew, my steadfastness, the rest of our great leadership, our team,
[55:38.640 --> 55:39.640]  and you out there.
[55:39.640 --> 55:41.160]  Because I want to explain something.
[55:41.160 --> 55:45.160]  You may think buying some products or giving a donation, oh, what does that do?
[55:45.160 --> 55:50.680]  This is not like giving some homeless heroin-head money so they can go buy more heroin.
[55:50.680 --> 55:54.400]  When you donate to us, you're investing in your future, you're investing in free speech,
[55:54.400 --> 56:00.920]  you're investing in an organization and a leader who will not back down at anything,
[56:00.920 --> 56:07.800]  who will never give in, who will never ever submit and who cannot be bought off or controlled.
[56:07.800 --> 56:09.600]  Period.
[56:09.600 --> 56:11.520]  Because that's getting between me and my salvation.
[56:11.520 --> 56:16.600]  I want to go with God, and so it is a blessing, it is a pleasure to be persecuted.
[56:16.600 --> 56:22.040]  It is an enjoyment to be attacked, not because I like pain, not because I like worrying about
[56:22.040 --> 56:26.760]  my family, but because they're already going to be destroyed if we don't defeat the globalist
[56:26.760 --> 56:28.080]  and if we don't have Jesus Christ.
[56:28.080 --> 56:32.360]  So I want my kids with me in eternity, I want our future progeny to have a great future
[56:32.360 --> 56:35.600]  here on this planet before they go to the next level.
[56:35.600 --> 56:40.280]  And this is an absolute dream job.
[56:40.280 --> 56:46.040]  I'm not a victim, I'm a leader, I'm not a victim, I'm a warrior.
[56:46.040 --> 56:49.600]  I'm not a victim, I'm a winner.
[56:49.600 --> 56:51.720]  We're going to destroy the globalist.
[56:51.720 --> 56:52.720]  We're going to defeat them.
[56:52.720 --> 56:54.280]  We're going to have a lot of other big challenges to come.
[56:54.280 --> 56:58.280]  So if we beat this challenge, we're going to go, that was baby stuff, and yeah, you're

[57:03.480 --> 57:06.040]  so we can now deal with this.
[57:06.040 --> 57:13.880]  It's an amazing universe, an amazing multiverse, an amazing creation of God Almighty.
[57:13.880 --> 57:16.680]  And I just want to go to the next level, don't you?
[57:16.680 --> 57:19.600]  I don't want to go to the next level on video games, I don't want to go to the next level,
[57:19.600 --> 57:22.000]  you know, being a pickup artist, nothing can see anybody that does that stuff.
[57:22.000 --> 57:25.480]  I don't want to go to the next level, be in the cool guy at the yacht club that everybody
[57:25.480 --> 57:27.480]  worships and thinks is cool.
[57:27.480 --> 57:29.280]  I want to change history.

[58:40.600 --> 58:50.120]  Head to InfowarsStore.com today.
[58:50.120 --> 58:55.600]  Before I started working at Infowars, I was not only a fan of Alex Jones and Infowars.com,
[58:55.600 --> 58:58.240]  but also the products at InfowarsStore.com.
[58:58.240 --> 59:04.200]  There's one product that's offered at InfowarsStore.com that is the elite of the supplements and that's
[59:04.200 --> 59:05.200]  DNA Force Plus.
[59:05.200 --> 59:09.400]  Now, I remember when Alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests,
[59:09.400 --> 59:14.640]  Telomere's and Telomere's support with your DNA, and so I started to look into the science
[59:14.640 --> 59:20.880]  and what Telomere's were and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect
[59:20.880 --> 59:21.880]  your Telomere's.
[59:21.880 --> 59:25.080]  So I started looking into DNA Force Plus, but it's expensive.
[59:25.080 --> 59:26.080]  Why?
[59:26.080 --> 59:28.200]  Because it is an elite supplement.
[59:28.200 --> 59:32.240]  And then I started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for
[59:32.240 --> 59:38.480]  Telomere's support, and they came and they went, but DNA Force Plus is still there.
[59:38.480 --> 59:39.960]  What is the elite supplement?
[59:39.960 --> 59:44.760]  I get excited when DNA Force Plus is on sale because I know it's expensive, so you should
[59:44.760 --> 59:53.440]  take advantage of 50% off DNA Force Plus at InfowarsStore.com.
[59:53.440 --> 01:00:18.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:44.200]  We're
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:54.100]  I don't normally air a clip twice in a show and I don't normally air the same clip repeatedly,
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:59.780]  but I'm going to do that right now because it's so important and it's the type of little
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:04.140]  mysteries that can catch hold and bring down whole systems.
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:08.640]  There's a lot of ways to punish big tech for working with the chai comms and suppress
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.080]  their own people and put two million people in forced labor camps and death camps.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:18.080]  That's mainline news, but they're liberal so you know, the guys doing it are trannies
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.080]  so it's alright.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:26.040]  Oh, it's a man dressing as a woman by all means, kill all those Chinese or those Uyghurs,
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.920]  Mongolians.
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:32.640]  But all of this is coming to a head and Trump is talking about taking action.
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:36.840]  Well, the Chinese angle in big tech alone means you must take action, in fact, forget
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:41.160]  the big tech angle on censorship, if you just have all the heads of big tech arrested
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.160]  for espionage.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:51.600]  But see, they're filled with old intelligence operatives from Bush and Obama and the Clintons.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.960]  But I mean, Google itself is only 20 something years old.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.840]  Same thing with Facebook, not even with Facebook, like 16, 15 years old.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.560]  Totally set up by the left, by the globalist.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:07.680]  And Trump, it's got to know this, it's even in Wired Magazine.
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.360]  A decade ago, Incutel funded it all.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:15.760]  And so, those are the stay-behind networks, so Mr. President, I wish in the message that
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:21.640]  Drudge, I know, got to you, I wish I had pointed out the chai-com angle of that, but I just
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.960]  focused on the 200 million accounts that got deleted that supported you on Instagram
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.200]  and Facebook in the last couple of days.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:31.840]  But what about the eyes, Mr. President?
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:37.480]  The eyes, Chico, it's always the eyes, the wind of the soul is Tony Montana says.
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.080]  What's going on with the eyes?
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:43.720]  If you're a radio listener, you've got to go to DrudgeReport.com.
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.400]  It's right in the middle there.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.360]  What's going on with Big Tech's eyes?
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.760]  That should become a trending thing on Twitter.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.760]  Hashtag, Big Tech's eyes.
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:55.200]  I don't have a Twitter account, but you guys do.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.880]  Hashtag, Big Tech's eyes.
[01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.680]  Let's get that trending, because they're hiding it in plain view.
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:05.880]  Here it is.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:11.760]  You know, the top Nazi, Werner von Braun, wrote a 1959 book, or 1949 book, I'm going
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:17.720]  from memory here, called Project Mars, where the Elans are the aliens who end up taking
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:18.720]  over the earth.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:22.040]  We wear the Elan, and the Elan invasion.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.560]  Dr. Werner von Braun, wonder what he knew.
[01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:30.040]  When I watched his promo about this with executives from his company, they all look like they're
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:31.040]  on hardcore drugs.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:37.560]  I mean, they're like sweating, their eyes are like lit up, like, I mean, they look nuts.
[01:03:37.560 --> 01:03:38.560]  You know when somebody's on drugs.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:42.600]  You know, they admit Silicon Valley is into hardcore speed and illusions.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:46.200]  They're taking IV drips at work of DMT.
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:51.520]  They're taking LSD microdoses in a cell-aside of mushrooms and peyote every day.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.600]  Who in the hell would want to join with these people?
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.320]  I've seen people take like three hits of acid, their eyes aren't that big.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320]  What the hell are they on?
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:02.040]  One of the crew members said maybe they've already got this whole neurolink, wires hooks
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.240]  in their brain, because this PKD pointed out, Philip K. Dick back in the 70s, the cyberpunk
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:10.480]  future is where you can get any type of pleasure you want, just plug in.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.960]  But no one wants to even get up or eat for weeks or days.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:16.680]  You just die because you just plug all this in, and it's the Matrix.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:21.040]  And now the Matrix is here, and you look at Tim Cook or Elon Musk or any of his executives
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:23.880]  when they're up there on that stage, they'll be under white lights.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:29.600]  Their pupils are 90% open, Zuckerberg, all of them, these people either have brain chips,
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.600]  that's it.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.240]  These guys are wire heads, something's going on.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:38.440]  I'm in here underneath, bright lights, and my pupils are very little.
[01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:42.640]  Now zoom into the camera, my pupils are tiny because I'm not on drugs, I've had two cups
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:43.640]  of coffee today.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.440]  So here, let me show you my pupils, okay?
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.440]  My pupils are little, they're supposed to close, that's what happens under the sun or
[01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:51.080]  under bright lights, but not these guys.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:55.000]  These are drug addicts, and they want the hit of wires in their brains, and all of them
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.160]  got those giant pupils.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:04.080]  Infobores, the most banned network in the world.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.560]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you, and we're under unprecedented
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:12.840]  evil attacks as you've seen, but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:16.880]  of my heart to tell you how much it means to me, that when you saw those lies against
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:20.200]  us the last week, the worst things you can say about people, that you knew they were
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.440]  liars, you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:26.840]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder, and I feel your love
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:27.840]  in my heart.
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.840]  I want you to know that love is right back at you, and I want to thank you for all you've
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:34.840]  done with your word of mouth, and your prayers, and your financial support, because I'm committed
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:39.760]  to fight to the end, but I want to win, and without you, I'm going to be destroyed, and
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:43.560]  it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important, the enemy could win.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:48.120]  We're a key chess piece in this fight, we're being used by God, you're being used by God,
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.000]  this is Providence, so I salute you, and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  of my heart.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  In For Wars, the most banned network in the world.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:28.200]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:36.280]  We are now four hours, four hours, ladies and gentlemen, into the 40 hour most extended
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:40.280]  live marathon broadcast we've ever done.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:45.720]  It's clownworld2, clownworld.us, where you find the live feed, so you can share it with
[01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.480]  people that aren't aware of what's happening.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:53.400]  The censored coverage of tonight's Democrat debates in Detroit, Michigan, or what's left
[01:06:53.400 --> 01:06:57.600]  of Detroit, Michigan, after the Democrats got done with it with NAFTA and Gatton, the
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:01.400]  liberals stealing all the city council money, and then tomorrow night we'll have live coverage
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:06.760]  there with Millie Weaver and Caitlin Bennett, our reporters on the ground, we've got constitutional
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:10.240]  lawyer Robert Barnes in studio with us next hour, he'll be with us in studio the next
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:14.240]  two days, Paul Joseph Watson's coming up, hosting the fourth hour, and back with us
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.680]  tomorrow as well, and so much more.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:22.600]  Infowars.com forward slash show is where you find the link, it's where we also have the
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:25.920]  biggest sales ever going right now, we're doing a money bomb where we want to gross
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:26.920]  $1 million.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:32.240]  Now, some of these discounts are so big, we're not making like $2 on a t-shirt or $2 on fluoride
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:36.440]  free toothpaste or stuff like that because these discounts are so huge, so a million
[01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:43.160]  dollars we have to bring in about $300,000 of funding that will help us fund some critical
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:47.760]  new operations, and notice it's a space shuttle, I've been doing this a while, why to come
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:54.600]  out with a space shuttle NASA design shirt in the last six months, why did I do that?
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.760]  Why did I do that?
[01:07:56.760 --> 01:08:03.440]  Because it's a payload, and it's a pro human future, and it's got a secret payload, and
[01:08:03.440 --> 01:08:09.080]  it needs fuel to get up into orbit to get its payload out, now we're actually paying
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:13.320]  for TV and radio satellites, so in a way the metaphor rings true with what you're probably
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.600]  guessing, we're actually going to pay to do something on satellite that's important to
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:21.080]  reach even more people, but that's only a small part of it, that's one of the seven
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:26.760]  projects, I said I had six projects going that are secret, there's actually seven, there's
[01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:31.320]  a satellite component, I was thinking of wow, that's even a better allegory of a secret
[01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:36.120]  payload, but that's not really it, several other operations are launched already fabulously
[01:08:36.120 --> 01:08:42.360]  successful on reaching people, not monetarily, but fabulously successful at reaching people,
[01:08:42.360 --> 01:08:46.860]  we have another three projects about to launch the next month, you're never going to hear
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:49.480]  about these projects, you're going to see them, you're going to enjoy them, they're
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:54.400]  going to be effective, I won't get the credit, doesn't matter, you get the credit, because
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:58.120]  it's essential in this de-platforming that people not know about the projects, and I'm
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:03.560]  not counting covert films I'm funding, there's about ten of those, I know eleven of those,
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.760]  I'm going to talk about covert books I'm funding, there's six or seven of those, those are
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:14.000]  all just little side torpedoes, but we have an amazing Christian conservative audience
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:20.400]  not of fake Bible-thumper Pharisees, but of real God-loving people, hard-working that
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:23.960]  feel the spirit of the New World Order in their churches, but they feel the spirit of
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:29.480]  action and God and Jesus Christ on this broadcast with all of our concerted efforts together,
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:35.560]  and so everybody else can't raise money, not all the trendies, not all the, no, we can,
[01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:42.040]  and because of you, you are the fuel, you're the rocket engines getting this up into orbit,
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.160]  and so I don't want to say the best thing that ever happened to me was de-platforming,
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:49.360]  it's been hard, we can't, you know, just reach hundreds of millions of young people
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.280]  like we were, everywhere I go, young people are like, I used to watch you all the time,
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:57.960]  I love you, my whole school loves you, where are you, and I'm like, in FullWars.com, kid,
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.280]  but it doesn't matter, I don't want to just preach the choir and you understand that,
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:07.520]  this is not a spectator sport, you are in the arena, so when you buy products at FullWars.com,
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:11.360]  that's how we get this done, and having these special events brings in the few extra million
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:17.720]  we need from all the censorship and all the persecution and all the lies, and then taking
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.080]  away our ability to advertise online and taking away our banking and taking away our paypal
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:26.840]  and then you got to pay 5% on every transaction, we do instead of 2% like we had, we had perfect
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:31.560]  credit, they put a hate designation, G2 out of Boston did just criminally, getting ready
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:35.600]  to sue them, takes money to do that, I got 5 lawsuits lined up, those aren't even secret
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:39.680]  projects, we got all these films I'm covertly funding, all these books that are coming out,
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.240]  you don't even know that we funded it, we've got all these lawsuits getting ready, those
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:48.400]  aren't even the 7 luscious projects, those don't even count!
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:53.760]  Boy, I bet the leftist stay behind networks, the CIA, they're head spinning, trying to
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:58.560]  keep track of all this, so we're not bragging, we're giving you a report on your hard-earned

[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.840]  of the most important products we've got, but I want you to experience it.
[01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:28.680]  Okay, I'm gonna shut up for the rest of the hour because one of my favorite guests, Gavin
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:34.640]  McGinnis, is joining us, freespeech.tv, he got banned everywhere, is successful, that
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:37.840]  is something you should all go subscribe to, and support him, he always put it out for
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.640]  free, but now he's in his mountain redoubt, and only you can go get the info and then
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:47.000]  share it with others, and he joins us, the first thing to get to is the Proud Boys,
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:53.200]  go on trial, we'll roll some of that video from New York, from being attacked by Antifa
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:57.120]  at a Gavin McGinnis event, they try to leave, they get attacked, but they committed the
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:12:01.960]  crime of fighting back against the journalist and professors in black, and kicking their
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:06.800]  ass should the Blasio's throwing the book at your folks, they lied and said they're
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.840]  a terror group, never designated as that, Trump's preparing to designate Antifa as a
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.640]  terror group, we'll talk about that more as well, but Gavin, this is an incredible
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.320]  time to be alive.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:21.800]  It's a scary time, we really reached peak clown world, and every time I say that, I
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:27.200]  go alright, it can't get crazier, but then it keeps getting more and more deranged, they
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:31.520]  can say whatever they want about us, but it doesn't apply to them, like the Proud Boys
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:35.680]  are called a violent hate group, and they beat up these guys on October 12th according
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:40.960]  to the media, after all these innocent people did, these anti-fascist protesters, was throw
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:46.160]  a little plastic bottle, oh is that all, meanwhile the truth is that the police had disbursed
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:50.760]  these violent protesters who had been beating journalists and throwing glass bottles of
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:56.200]  urine at the attendees, who by the way, the attendees of my talk were multi-racial Jews,
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:01.760]  Christian, Atheists, black, white, gay, the Antifa were all white, and they're screaming
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:07.000]  follow your leader, 9mm about Hitler and kill all the Nazis, no more Nazis, so the police
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:13.080]  eventually disbursed them, as the NYPD press conference said, Antifa went around the block,
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:17.560]  circled around the block, ambushed these guys, as they were on their way home, these guys
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:22.880]  defended themselves, but the crime apparently is they defended themselves too well, and
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:29.920]  were too enthusiastic about their victory, and now one of them is facing 60 years in
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:33.960]  prison, you can believe that.
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:41.960]  You're speechless, I mean this is because the greatest crime is fighting the mass crusaders
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:47.360]  who we know are media people, university professors and government employees, who go out and hit
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.480]  people in the head with crowbars, who throw cement blocks on people's heads, and quit
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:55.360]  cretin' their eyes, and then are worshiped as gods.
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:00.360]  Well we say, oh there's some of them are in media and radical newspapers, no you've got
[01:14:00.360 --> 01:14:07.600]  like Kim Kelly, an avowed Antifa member, writing for Teen Vogue, talking to our teenage girls
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:15.280]  and telling them what to think, and why anti-fascists are peaceful people, and we have avowed Antifa
[01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:19.640]  members that work in the top executive class in Twitter.
[01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:23.240]  And here's the other thing I didn't realize until now, and especially with this trial,
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:29.480]  those social justice warriors you saw in the 90's and early 2000's, they are now in the
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:36.400]  justice system, they are lawyers, they are putting men in cages, these grumpy feminist
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:42.240]  lawyers are now DA's and prosecutors, I'm not criticizing the proud boys DA, I'm talking
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:47.120]  in general here, I wouldn't dare do that and jeopardize these guys' trial, but all over
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:53.280]  the country these lawyers that you assume are unbiased are social justice warriors, especially
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:58.520]  the women it seems, especially the feminists, they're judges too, and they're putting men
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:04.600]  in cages because they've decided they hate someone, and isn't it funny too how before
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:12.520]  clown world you were allowed to be conservative, now since Trump, if you are remotely right
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:19.640]  of Antifa you are a Nazi, I was just denied service at a bar on Saturday at this bar called
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:24.480]  strange love, which is kind of like a punky bar, and just because of my political beliefs
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:28.760]  they said we won't serve you, what does that remind you of?
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:33.400]  Oh listen, this just happened a few months ago when Beto O'Rourke had this rally downtown,
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.360]  he was 30 minutes late so we stepped into a bar, me and my security guys, we were sitting
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:41.400]  over there politely, people were asking for autographs, and the bar tender goes you need
[01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:45.560]  to get out of here, these leftists don't like you, I said hey, you're absolutely welcome,
[01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:49.080]  he goes yeah, I don't even want your money, just get out, and I was like boom, thanks
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:53.000]  a lot, and I said believe me, I don't want to be in your bar anyways, hang a sign out
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.080]  in front, tell me, you don't want Americans in here.

[01:16:15.840 --> 01:16:19.560]  inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.520]  is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets, not a security

[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:30.760]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla, I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:35.320]  my mother's house, I sued the IRS and won, I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:39.360]  them ever since, I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:43.240]  deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved, I can help you too.
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:47.360]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:58.360]  tax case, call 800 34 no tax or go to my website, danpilla.com, that's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:03.280]  George Arwell said that in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:07.960]  act and so used to it wasn't that important to wear the American flag because we still
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:11.520]  love our country and there wasn't a large group of people that actually hated it, but
[01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:16.840]  now they're trying to take it out of schools, they're taking it down off of government buildings.
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:20.600]  Weird white leftist that won a virtue signaler pulling down American flags and running up
[01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:25.800]  Mexican flags, this is the bizarreness of the America hating we're seeing, so now it is
[01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:30.400]  a revolutionary act in a time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:35.480]  the American flag, particularly the Betsy Ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:41.400]  it says on the back, right there ladies and gentlemen, americasbackinfowars.com, so whatever
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:46.640]  you do take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies face all over
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:50.400]  not just the US but worldwide because more than ever the American flag is a symbol of
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:58.200]  freedom against globalism.
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:03.560]  The globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators, they are technocrats, they are
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:07.600]  control freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:12.720]  and make your own decisions hits are the way of their great destiny to merge with AI gods.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:16.400]  Now we're fighting them hard in cyberspace, we're fighting them hard right here in the
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:20.920]  third dimension, but one of the biggest places that we neglect to forget that we've really
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.880]  got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies.
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:29.160]  If I wasn't taking the highest quality supplements from ForrestLife.com I couldn't do it.
[01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:33.520]  That's why we decided to take our original Secret 12 that was incredibly high quality
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:39.240]  mezzocobalamin and double the strength of it in a new formula, Ultra 12.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:44.120]  Ultra 12 is undoubtedly the strongest, highest quality B12 over the counter that you're going
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.120]  to find anywhere.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:50.280]  It is amazing, experience pure mezzocobalamin B12 for yourself and fund the second American
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:20:01.440]  Revolution against the tyrants at infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:29.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:40.200]  We were supposed to just roll over and die, Americans were, we were supposed to just give
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:44.960]  up our media, give up our families, give up our factories, give up our guns, give up our
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:49.640]  belief in ourselves, be demoralized, but the universities and big tech in Hollywood funded
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:55.200]  by the chai comms are failing, but Gavin McGinnis is one of the most banned people in the world.
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:21:00.160]  I have to say I am the most demonized and most banned after Trump, but when it comes
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:07.440]  to Scorched Earth demonizing proud boys that he founded that never called for violence,
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:12.400]  just called for pro first amendment and standing up to Antifa, if they attack you.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:17.120]  But for saying I don't support killing cops, I don't support getting women in the head
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:26.280]  for no reason with hammers or with bike locks or attacking children, well they have banned
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:30.160]  them and everybody's bank accounts associated with it, anyone Gavin said hey, I founded
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:36.160]  it but it was just an idea of western chauvinism and being proud of being American, but I disassociate
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:40.280]  just for the good of the group, that wasn't good enough.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:45.120]  And now anyone that even has Gavin on, that was even an MSNBC Associated Press, well Jones
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:51.560]  when they totally banned using my name on Facebook in a positive mention or M4s.com,
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:57.800]  they said well the last straw was he had Gavin McGinnis on, so you can hear him say I'm not
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:58.800]  all these things.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.960]  See Trump is big enough that he can say I didn't say black people are rats, I said Elijah
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:06.640]  Cummings is not taking care of his constituents and saying the border patrol is horrible when
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:09.640]  they're taking way better care of these kids than Elijah Cummings does.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:14.160]  Oh, you're not supposed to defend yourself with common sense and so here's a minute
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:18.960]  and a half clip of just some of the mainstream media defending Antifa who's now saying they're
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.000]  going to attack border patrol agents, here it is.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:30.080]  I argue to you tonight all punches are not equal morally, in the eyes of the law, yes,
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:33.360]  but in the eyes of good and evil, here's the argument.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:38.160]  They are strictly principled anti-fascists and what they see in the Trump administration
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:44.120]  and what they see happening in this country, they see the neo-fascism that we see and they
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:48.480]  have taken a principle stand to stand against white supremacists and white nationalists
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.920]  wherever they may show up.
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:55.120]  It says it right in the name, Antifa, anti-fascism, which is what they were there fighting.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:59.000]  Listen, there's, you know, no organization is perfect, there was some violence.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:03.920]  I think that a lot of people recognize that when pushed self-defense is a legitimate response
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:06.240]  to white supremacy and neo-nazi violence.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:12.200]  The problem is to equate the violence in reaction against bigotry with the bigotry itself is
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:17.160]  to misunderstand the fact that when you go to cancer treatment, the radiation is tough
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:20.880]  treatment, but it is meant to remove the cancer.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:24.960]  There's a group of anti-fascists called the Black Bloc, which do tend to get violent.
[01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:30.120]  Their idea is, look, non-violence hasn't worked and we are going to try to stop this, but
[01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:34.040]  they wouldn't have been there, they wouldn't have been anywhere near there had it not been
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:39.040]  for the fact that white supremacists, neo-nazis, were out scaring the living daylout out of
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.880]  most of the people in that town.
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:44.880]  Thuggishness is thuggishness wherever it comes from politically and we should be the first
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.320]  to call it out.
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:51.080]  Only one rational voice there and now the violence has gotten much worse, firebombing,
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:55.560]  shootings of ICE facilities, it just gets more insane, of course they were first founded
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:24:00.760]  by the Communist Party, Clinton used them to riot in 99 in Seattle to then attack the
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.800]  peaceful protesters, turned out they were actually working for Clinton, that even came
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.800]  out mainstream news.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:11.520]  I mean, Gavin, Antifa is a deep state tool, my friend, aren't they?
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:15.240]  They're the paramilitary wing of the DNC and I've heard them mock the notion that they
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:17.240]  get paid by globalists.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:21.400]  I don't think they're tenacious enough to get the check, there are plenty of protesters
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:27.200]  who get money from this group, but a lot of these Antifa, I almost feel sorry for them.
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:33.000]  For example, there's this kid, David Campbell, who was so brainwashed by Antifa that he beat
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:39.120]  the crap out of a Jewish guy, a 56-year-old Jewish guy who was attending a Mike Cernovich
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:40.920]  party called A Night for Freedom.
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:45.960]  He beat that guy, strangled him, the guy had a heart attack, then the Antifa started beating
[01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:48.160]  up cops, putting them in the headlock and stuff.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:51.440]  I shouldn't say beating up, fighting cops, he got his ass kicked.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:56.480]  But he's looking at 15 years in prison now or there was this other kid, what was his
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:25:06.480]  name in New Orleans, Ryan, who was facing serious felony charges for Disrupt J-20.
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.520]  He ended up getting so scared of his imminent trial that he killed himself.
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:17.520]  Or we have Pym Fortun in the Netherlands, who was murdered by Antifa activists.
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:22.200]  They always talk about Heather Hire, but they never talk about the deaths that Antifa causes
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:26.640]  or the lives Antifa ruins, a lot of the time, this is going to sound crazy, but you know
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:29.280]  how no one kills more Muslims than Muslims?
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:31.880]  Nathan Hose was his name, the guy who killed himself.
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:36.520]  No one hurts and ruins the lives of Antifa more than Antifa, because these guys think
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:40.400]  they're killing Nazis and they're fighting Nazis, like the dummies who attacked those
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:45.320]  Marines in Philadelphia thinking they were proud boys and they were calling them wetbacks
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:46.520]  and spicks.
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:51.600]  Those guys are going to go to jail for 10 years, they're going to get raped in prison.
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:58.120]  So this Antifa narrative, this lie that there's Nazis around every corner is getting Antifa
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:25:59.120]  locked up.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:07.160]  I mean, the organization is using the mentally weak as useful idiots they can use as pawns,
[01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.040]  as cannon fodder.
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:16.120]  There's an article from January of last year on infowars.com that we'll put on screen that
[01:26:16.120 --> 01:26:22.640]  has the headline, Obama planned martial law in Baltimore, Maryland in 2015.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:26.120]  We got the secret documents from a family member that had Antifa brother who went to
[01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:31.240]  jail later for other events, and it was all there, how Alexander Soros funds it, how they
[01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:33.680]  do it, how they're trying to incite a race war.
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:38.280]  I mean, all those documents are right there that this is being funded by the Democratic
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.560]  Party and others, and that's why the media, the corporate media promotes it and defends
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:42.560]  it.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:49.040]  Wasn't there a story where Obama was paying for buses to go and do a huge Trayvon Martin
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.040]  demonstration?
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.200]  Do you remember that story?
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:57.400]  Yes, that came out, whatever, five years ago, six years ago, the whole Trayvon Martin
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:03.920]  thing was mainstream news, the Justice Department, it was Eric Holder funded at least three demonstrations
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:08.840]  with buses sending people in there, totally states.
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:13.960]  Eric Holder, the guy who said, you can no longer discuss race in crime statistics because
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:16.840]  he felt it made Blacks look bad.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:21.800]  I think it makes Blacks look bad, I think the DNC makes Blacks look bad.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:26.520]  They are responsible for places like Baltimore, they are responsible for shattering the Black
[01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:34.160]  family by promoting welfare, they are responsible for all of the worst cities in America and
[01:27:34.160 --> 01:27:38.680]  all of the crime in America and the plight of Black people in America.
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:44.200]  And I think the DNC is petrified of Black people waking up to that and seeing Blexit
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:50.680]  because without Black people the DNC are nothing and the DNC uses them, just like I was saying
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:58.240]  and Tifa uses these poor, these disadvantaged kids as fodder, the DNC is using Black people
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:27:59.240]  as fodder.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.240]  They are their little pets.
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:04.560]  And let's be clear, it's interesting that we got these secret documents out of Baltimore
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:08.840]  where they tried to cause the riots and martial law, but it didn't go as far as they wanted,
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:14.320]  that that was staged by Obama trying to get a nationwide race riot going and of course
[01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:20.120]  it's Elijah Cummings district, wherever the Democrats have control they really see Black
[01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:25.920]  people as their slaves and are trying to get them to riot and race riot but Black folks
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:30.360]  aren't doing it to the extent the Democrats want, I mean that is really racist.
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:35.920]  So those secret documents from Friends of Democracy on InfoWars.com, sorry go ahead.
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:37.280]  I think we're coming to the end.
[01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.680]  I think Black people are waking up.
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.680]  We never had more Black conservatives.
[01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:46.800]  They're seeing the woke ones or the genuinely woke ones are seeing that Trump is not racist
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:51.800]  and I think they're also starting to clue in that Obama took advantage of them by pretending
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.000]  he was part of the Black American experience.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:56.760]  If you're raised by white Marxists in Hawaii.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.760]  You're not.

[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:08.440]  transhumanist globalist world government mark of the beast agenda.
[01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:12.400]  The forces of evil are trying to censor and suppress the tip of the spear info wars more
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.400]  than ever.

[01:33:24.080 --> 01:33:29.840]  the listeners of 25 years let's be on air for betting on the right horse you bet on
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:35.680]  yourself you bet on America you bet on freedom we've fallen a long way but we're beginning
[01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:40.840]  to come back I agree with Gavin McEnnis syndicated radio TV house with the most censored people
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:48.840]  in the world fact he's right up there in media as my only peer at this level of total censorship
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:54.080]  and demonization and that that that shows you he's articulate he's a friendly guy people
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:34:02.080]  like him he launched the original vice which is I'm called libertarian very inclusive and
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:04.880]  because he's well-spoken and smart they want him off air you were finishing up with the
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:09.600]  debates tonight and the race baiting and what's happening with Trump and them saying it's
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:13.800]  racist to say that Democrat controlled areas are hell holes and that the Democrats are
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:17.680]  corrupt big city machines that's simply amazing and then we're going to get into some other
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:23.680]  subjects like Roger Stone you mentioned during the break we have the clip coming up so we
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:27.720]  look at that in a few minutes and the fact that Mueller wouldn't even deny that they'd
[01:34:27.720 --> 01:34:33.160]  tipped off CNN well obviously they tipped off CNN but but now Mueller won't even deny it
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:39.560]  so where you think that's going next Jeffrey Epstein and so much more but going back to
[01:34:39.560 --> 01:34:46.640]  Gavin McEnnis of free speech dot TV finishing up with the paradigm shift the polls show
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:52.520]  it even their skewed polls show double the number of Hispanics supporting Trump double
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:59.280]  the number of black supporting Trump that scares the hell out of that political system
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:05.760]  where do you think that's going I think that the DNC are losing the black vote and because
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:10.720]  blacks are sick of being taken advantage of I mean if you go up to a black guy in the
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:15.560]  hood you go yo what's up my man yo he would immediately smell a rat and go who is this
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:19.680]  guy pandering to me and they've been doing that politically Obama was doing that by
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:25.040]  pretending he gets the black American experience and Ali Alexander pointed out that not only
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:31.520]  is Obama a guy raised by Marx Marxist white people in Hawaii but Kamala Harris her dad
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:36.960]  was not around and she went to high school in Montreal her mother's Indian she hasn't
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:41.280]  experienced the black American experience and when she talks about segregation and
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:47.000]  busing blacks can smell a rat they can go you're pandering to me and that's insulting
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:54.440]  you're Canadian you're Indian you don't know our culture and I really feel like black Americans
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:59.800]  are saying wait a minute why is everyone trying to dupe me into liking them with Hillary Clinton
[01:35:59.800 --> 01:36:08.200]  and her her hot sauce and her purse it's it's insulting and it's racist why do you think
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:13.600]  the head of failed CNN is so in love with her and says she's special and she should
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:20.240]  be president now CNN is gonna be hosting this debate tonight I think because they they see
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:24.920]  that racial identity politics have done them so well in the past that they just want to
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.520]  make it all about race and that you know they say if you're a white male step aside that's
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:33.240]  sort of the new motto of the DNC they have hate has no home here and there all their
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:38.320]  eggs are in the basket that America is full of hate and I think anyone who's gone outside
[01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:43.440]  and walked around goes wait a minute this is only in the minds of the media as far as
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:47.680]  me walking down the street I just see people shaking hands and talking to each other the
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:52.760]  media has made a fake America and Antifa's contributed that and it's a horrible place
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:58.400]  to be by the way like you look at the SPLC's hate map and you go Jesus there's a clan rally
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:02.160]  on every corner and then you step outside and there's some black guy talking to a white
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:06.880]  lady saying how's your aunt is she still sick now she's she's not as sick but we don't know
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:12.400]  if it's gonna come back oh I'm sorry to hear that Isaac they've made a fake disgusting
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:18.320]  horrible America you're absolutely right look at this article DCC the executive director
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:24.160]  force resigned because she's white she apologizes because she's white this is info wars dot com
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:30.560]  is not a joke and resigned saying white people are bad and everyone clapped like teaching
[01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:38.240]  minorities that white people are bad here's the article apologizes cries for not contributing
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:46.000]  to diversity yes really jazz low an iraq war veteran attended an all-staff meeting on monday
[01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:52.640]  to make it official the two Hispanic lawmakers representatives the sin taken zealous and
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:59.200]  philmona vella demanded she stepped down on sunday for not doing enough to diversify the DCCC
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:05.440]  leadership reports the american mirror so I mean this is just going into hyper warp my friend
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:10.640]  but remember when they say she didn't do enough for diversity they weren't talking about her actions
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:16.400]  she was doing plenty for diversity but her face wasn't doing enough for diversity her actual skin
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:21.840]  on her body wasn't doing enough for diversity so she was pushed out and that's that's their model
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:27.520]  it's a strange place to be it's a it's a strange basket to put all your eggs in well example just
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:32.640]  there's seven and a half million people in the world and maybe six hundred million are white
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:38.080]  okay maybe there's a 10% of world population's white and if you can teach whites they're evil
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:42.160]  and then teach everybody else that they owe you something you'll then enslave all the white people
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:45.760]  and they're the new slaves and nothing they do is ever good enough I mean that's really what's going
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:53.200]  on well we're at the point now where black people are in trouble for being racist as white race
[01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:58.800]  like the proud boys have tons of black members and they call it multiracial white supremacy
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:03.680]  so you're going to start seeing visible minorities who are getting fired or pushed out for being
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:09.200]  white supremacists so Rachel does now who doesn't have a one drop of african blood in her dresses
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:15.120]  up puts on the bronzers frizzes her hair she actually knows what she's doing it's like the
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:19.600]  founder of black lives matter isn't black but but but these folks get it and again they're being
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:24.320]  paid by the Ford foundation the Carnegie Foundation the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation it turns
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:29.200]  out the number one funder of the whole black lives matter movement and this whole whites are
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:35.280]  inherently evil movement what do you think's behind that it's all about splitting us up it's
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.800]  all about separating the country because they're easier to control if you can vilify half the
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.440]  country and call them racist robots and that's what I try to do on free speech dot tv I've had
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:47.760]  Michael Eric Dyson who you just featured I've had Cornell West I've had Harry Belafonte's
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:53.760]  daughter Gina Belafonte I've had Mark Lamont Hill all teamed up with conservatives to discuss
[01:39:53.760 --> 01:39:57.760]  things and it's one of the only places you can have an open forum like this and when you put
[01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:02.400]  these two together you realize they disagree in a lot of stuff I found that it's very hard to convince
[01:40:02.400 --> 01:40:07.840]  these liberals that cops aren't racist for example however there's a lot of things that we do have
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:11.840]  in common and you know Ann Coulter of the other night was talking about how disappointed she is
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:16.880]  in Trump and I think Gina Belafonte was stunned to hear that we don't follow everything he does no
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:22.800]  matter what and the powers that be don't want us to talk they don't want us to get to the bottom
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:28.400]  of things because that way they're not controlling the narrative and when we are allowed to speak
[01:40:28.400 --> 01:40:33.040]  to each other we get along pretty well let me raise that point well I totally agree it's
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:36.560]  what I want to keep us divided so they say don't go to a Trump rally they're all kkk and you go
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:41.840]  there you're a quote minority you're loved let's talk about and we're going to a muller next segment
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:47.520]  let's talk about Trump and where he gets a pluses where he gets b's where he gets f's uh clearly
[01:40:47.520 --> 01:40:52.880]  not fighting the censorship saying he will doing nothing letting big tech work with china doing
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:56.640]  nothing I mean he really because he loves corporations he loves turning them loose he is
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:02.240]  really screwing the pooch on that drudge linked to our big uh video or you know I said wise
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:07.120]  trump committing political suicide and then that's gone viral over a million views just on our own
[01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:14.240]  side of that thanks to drudge very important to cause that debate uh so so uh yeah I mean
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:18.160]  he's not tough on the board we have record numbers coming in but he can't get the funding so how's
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:23.120]  that his fault so I think and goes too far I think until colt is good overall I just you know
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:29.200]  trump is not a dictator true and we love the free market so we're wary of the government
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:35.280]  controlling uh corporations but the big picture here is big tech is controlling the national
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:41.600]  conversation that's unacceptable he they are censoring people censoring one side conservatives
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:46.880]  and not allowing us to defend ourselves so we can be vilified deep platform dehumanized and
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:51.760]  eventually killed that's their real goal is to have us killed that's why colter and I and you
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:56.480]  need bodyguards when we go outside because people want us dead secondly the border yes he didn't
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:00.880]  get the funding but he's the president of the united states we should have had a wall by now we
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:05.280]  should have a wall exactly like israel's it's one of the most effective things I've ever seen in my
[01:42:05.280 --> 01:42:15.760]  life it's a work of art israel's wall and third we have lost the culture in this country we've
[01:42:15.760 --> 01:42:21.040]  lost free speech we we've become it like Jim Godo was talking the other day and he goes can you
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:26.960]  believe we won because it doesn't feel like we won conservatives if you were a mega hat in a bar in
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:31.680]  any liberal city you're booted out of that bar stay there let's talk about trump's report card
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:35.680]  positive and negative when we come back and then i'm gonna do something on air that i did this
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:41.040]  morning type in alex jones into google web search for three pages i don't show up to the end of the
[01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:47.920]  third page folks number one i'm top rank on my website but see this is how i'm being depersoned
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:53.280]  even from searchability and just last week senator moment all said i want him unsearchable
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:43:00.720]  they said yes sir we're working on it george arwell said that in a time of universal deceit
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:04.800]  telling the truth is a revolutionary act and so used to it wasn't that important to wear the
[01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:09.120]  american flag because we still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people that
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:14.240]  actually hated it but now they're trying to take it out of schools they're taking it down off of
[01:43:14.240 --> 01:43:18.960]  government buildings weird white leftist that want a virtue signal or pulling down american flags
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:24.720]  and running up mexican flags this is the bizarreness of the america hating we're seeing so now it is a
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:29.760]  revolutionary act at the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying to wear the american
[01:43:29.760 --> 01:43:35.120]  flag particularly the betsy ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when it says on the back

[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:15.840]  that's not being funded by secrets foreign government it is completely independent of all
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:21.280]  that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression of the freedom
[01:45:21.280 --> 01:45:25.600]  of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.320]  of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this because
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:34.000]  this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:38.080]  mostly been co-opted by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:43.360]  control and manipulate what news it views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and
[01:45:43.360 --> 01:45:48.400]  the info wars audience has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:52.800]  the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:59.920]  onslaught of the platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth palak yes i got a plug for
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:04.240]  the patriot points i get oh thanks i got 180 dollars so far this year and i feel like i'm
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:08.160]  stealing from you i buy so much in the store because i mean i don't want to get that money to
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:11.600]  walmart i don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to causes i don't believe
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.360]  in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting quality product the products that i do
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:20.480]  receive have changed my life i mean the x2 has really done a lot for me i've lost weight my brain
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:25.120]  works a whole lot better i think my kids they use the toothpaste my son used to get these little
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:29.760]  sore throats and he puts x2 in water drinks it and it gets rid of his sore throat uh well sir let
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:33.920]  me break this down for you i want high quality stuff in there i want a good price but i've kind
[01:46:33.920 --> 01:46:38.560]  of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making two dollars on the
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:42.880]  toothpaste 50 percent off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric or the
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:47.200]  bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the patriot points a lot
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.960]  of times it makes things a loss leader because if you're already getting 10 percent off because
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:54.880]  you're on autoship then we're doing 50 percent off and then you do something like that uh where
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:57.600]  you have patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support

[01:51:17.120 --> 01:51:23.280]  under his butt about the censorship and other things please continue yeah i mean with trump it's
[01:51:23.280 --> 01:51:28.800]  it's the wall and big tech problems those are two major problems because one is free speech the other
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:35.040]  is ending america i mean the left ones no borders no wall no us at all so without walls you don't
[01:51:35.040 --> 01:51:39.520]  have a country without borders you don't have a country and that's what they want from us they
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:45.440]  want zero borders but more importantly i want to talk about how complicit the mainstream media is
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:51.440]  in this radical agenda and i think the the arrest of roger stone is a perfect example of how weak
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:56.400]  journalism has become how terrible everyone is at their job and how these guys are able to get
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:52:02.560]  away with murder like this guy david short tell he's at cnn he's basically a little kid i wouldn't
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:07.600]  be comfortable loaning him my car i definitely wouldn't loan him any of my motorbikes he's a child
[01:52:08.160 --> 01:52:15.200]  and he claims that he just had a hunch so he goes from dc to palm springs that night however
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:19.600]  he had a hunch roger stone was going to be arrested that night however he doesn't start his stake out
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:26.960]  right away when he lands he goes to a hotel he has a nap he has some fun then he gets up he gets to
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:34.880]  roger stone's 15 minutes before the bus he told cnn cnn pushed this idea that he was there an hour
[01:52:34.880 --> 01:52:40.080]  before they say he was there at five and stone was busted at six something like that roger stone's
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:45.680]  home cameras that he showed on tucker carlson show that the boy was there 15 minutes before
[01:52:45.680 --> 01:52:51.600]  now that's a hell of a hunch imagine being so confident in your hunch that you go and nap at
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:59.280]  a hotel before you go and stake out a place and your stake out is 15 minutes that is bs and the
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:05.200]  fact that you're able to be that lazy about a hustle is downright embarrassing to all the
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:11.600]  hustlers and grifters out there 15 and i saw cnn when it was happening and i remember them bragging
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:17.040]  about their intrepid reporting and how tenacious they are and how great they are at figuring out
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:22.240]  things right down to 15 minutes so when moeller said i'm sorry i'm not going to say that we didn't
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:27.840]  link to cnn the mainstream any any journalist worth his salt should be all over this interrogating
[01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:33.840]  david short tell and going how did you know 15 minutes before that's the shortest stake out
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:40.080]  in the history of stakeouts talk to any detective talk to any private detective a stakeouts two weeks
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:45.600]  the shortest one ever was probably three days 15 minutes how are they getting away with this
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:53.120]  and of course we first released that footage a day before anybody else did roger gave it to us
[01:53:53.120 --> 01:53:58.240]  exclusively and the media was so disciplined they didn't cover anywhere in the national news that we
[01:53:58.240 --> 01:54:03.360]  released the exclusive raid footage showing and pulling up 15 minutes before and here's the key
[01:54:03.360 --> 01:54:09.360]  gab mckinnis and people watching on tv right now could see this for radio listeners will
[01:54:09.360 --> 01:54:14.160]  repost it tim fours dot com the front page just because you're making this point once we later
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:19.040]  post the clipping from this live show that they pull up they walk over they know him he talks to
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:23.920]  him they direct him they tell him what to shoot in the police the fbi tell him when to leave so
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:31.680]  here's your headline the fbi was directing the cnn crew you're right that's that's a much better
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:38.320]  point and you look up david short tells twitter and the guy is a is a it's like an intern like he
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:43.120]  just reports on local crime and there was a shooting in south pasadena two victims uh
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:47.760]  their police are investigating so this guy who has the best stakeout in history of stakeouts
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:53.760]  gets the biggest scoop ever every single other one of his stories is just there was a bank robbery
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:59.680]  in san diego that had lost over 10 000 where's your other scoops mr super hunch you've got the
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:05.120]  best mind for investigative journalism in the world and you can only get one scoop how do we
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:09.920]  let them get away with this every day you're absolutely right and again i'll go back to this
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:15.680]  one of the media we got the footage from roger once his lawyers allowed us to be released he
[01:55:15.680 --> 01:55:20.240]  let us release that we got it the day before it was on fox news at night we put it out that night
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:26.080]  a whole day later tucker covers it so it gets national attention the corporate media was so
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:31.840]  controlled they wouldn't show hours of the raid because they thought they found the footage you
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:36.720]  see them take the camera down to the wrong camera they try to find the dvr they get the wrong dvr
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:42.560]  we had the whole raid we put the whole three-hour raid out and the media was so disciplined that
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:47.280]  they would not cover it unless tucker carlson did a day later and again we're showing the footage
[01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:52.240]  of them directing the the reporter everything and then the fbi lied about remember that
[01:55:52.240 --> 01:55:58.480]  yeah and can we just go back and look at what roger stone why is he being bankrupted why is
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:02.880]  he going to have to pay about two million dollars in legal fees why might he die in prison he must
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:08.000]  have murdered someone right he must have been working with the russians to to to uh rig the
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:12.480]  elections no they asked him if he got an email from julien assange this is a guy working on a
[01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:17.440]  campaign who gets thousands of emails a day during the campaign he goes no he did get an email from
[01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:23.120]  julien assange the email was totally irrelevant didn't contain anything uh salacious there's no
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:27.120]  juice in that email it was just a random email roger has gotten over two million emails
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:36.320]  he's facing prison to death he may die in prison because of a typo so our side has to be so perfect
[01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:41.040]  that the covington catholic school kids can't stand their ground proud boys can't fight back
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:47.920]  if they're beaten up i can't say anything um but they can call for violence all over the place
[01:56:47.920 --> 01:56:52.160]  they can work with cnn direct things they got more people going to roger stone's house
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:57.440]  than went to bin laden's house it's it's this odd balance and i think i'm i'm mad at trump for that

[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:38.000]  here here's here's the hearing he got asked twice about it but here's one of the times he got asked
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:43.600]  uh last wednesday and wouldn't deny that the fbi uh tipped off the media i mean of course they did
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:50.640]  here it is mr muller are you aware of anyone from your team having given advanced knowledge
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:57.760]  of the raid on roger stone's home to any person or the press including cnn well i'm not going to
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:06.000]  talk about specifics uh i will mention but talk for a moment about persons who become involved
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  in an investigation and the understanding that um in a lengthy thorough investigation
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:22.720]  some persons will be under a cloud that they should not be under a cloud and one of the reasons
[02:01:22.720 --> 02:01:27.920]  for emphasizing as i have the speed of an election or not election the speed of an investigation
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:34.000]  is that so those persons who are disrupted as a result of the i appreciate that but i do have
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:38.480]  a series of questions with the result of that investigation thank you and you're right it is a
[02:01:38.480 --> 02:01:43.120]  cloud and it's an unfair cloud for dozens of people but to my point are you aware of anyone
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:47.440]  providing information to the media regarding the raid on roger stone's home including cnn
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:56.000]  i'm not gonna speak to that okay i mean they did it they lied about it it's all political it's a
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:04.080]  joke closing comments on that gab mckinnis then let's antagonize david worthon that we have to mock
[02:02:04.080 --> 02:02:08.800]  these people we let them get away with this and we have to say no we sussed you out we saw your
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:14.320]  hustle cnn and we're calling you on it i'm sick of them getting with flies like for example not to
[02:02:14.320 --> 02:02:19.680]  open a whole other pandora's box but the new york post today they talk about this bigot who did the
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:27.200]  shooting in the at the garlic festival you mean the iranian bigot who had arab pro islam instagram
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:33.520]  stuff who said he hates white twats they're so determined to make this nazi america that they
[02:02:33.520 --> 02:02:40.640]  ignore a half arab pro islam guy who is worse than that they said that he had something on his
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:50.640]  instagram about a white supremac neo nazi from 1889 neo nazi didn't exist till 1946 unless they got
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:56.560]  time machine suddenly exactly he's an islamist he goes in attacks and it turns into a white
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:05.200]  neo nazi from 1889 modern journalists are now activists they're just antifa radical alt left
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:09.600]  activists who are pretending that they're reporting the news but they're not they're not reporting
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:15.920]  anything they are controlling the conversation and manipulating data and events in order to push
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:20.800]  their agenda and we let them do it that's the part that pisses me off that's what i want to end on
[02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:25.120]  why are conservatives letting them get away with this when a bartender says you got to go you're

[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:06.480]  but also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one product that's offered at info
[02:05:06.480 --> 02:05:11.760]  wars store dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna force plus now i
[02:05:11.760 --> 02:05:16.480]  remember when alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests tele mirrors
[02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:22.560]  and tele mirror support with your dna so i started to look into the science and what tele mirrors were
[02:05:22.560 --> 02:05:28.320]  and how it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your tele mirrors so i started
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:34.480]  looking into dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then
[02:05:34.480 --> 02:05:39.920]  i started seeing other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for tele mirror support
[02:05:39.920 --> 02:05:46.560]  and they came and they went but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement i get
[02:05:46.560 --> 02:05:51.600]  excited when dna force plus is on sale because i know it's expensive so you should take advantage
[02:05:51.600 --> 02:05:55.840]  of 50 off dna force plus at info wars store dot com
[02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:09.040]  devastating devastating globalist lies exposing the mainstream media's propaganda machine

[02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:54.720]  yes ladies and gentlemen you can call this broadcast the devastator

[02:07:08.560 --> 02:07:12.960]  how dare you say children are going to us how dare you say we're hurting children when we're
[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:16.720]  taking great care of them and we're totally overwhelmed and you wouldn't have the funding
[02:07:16.720 --> 02:07:24.720]  and you blocked the funding this year unbelievable just seven months ago
[02:07:27.360 --> 02:07:34.000]  they killed the 12.6 billion dollar spending package trump wanted and what gave like 1.3
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:39.840]  billion for border and emergency centers and said there is no crisis there are no caravans
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:45.920]  i'm hoping to just just break the border completely they already broke in the courts everything else
[02:07:47.760 --> 02:07:55.360]  and then they say that trump caused the crisis they actually engineered with the un and soros
[02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:03.040]  it's just unbelievable and now president trump has come out
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:10.800]  and pointed out all of this
[02:08:13.360 --> 02:08:19.680]  and they don't know what to do he's like comings you have the second most crime-ridden
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:28.640]  most rat-filled hellhole because the government won't hallway dumping they won't go after anybody
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:34.800]  the system is hopelessly corrupt and you sit upon all these blue cities
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:42.960]  and they spent it that trumps the races because that's all they've got that people aren't buying
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:49.120]  it anymore i want to play paul joseph watson report into this and then i want to come back
[02:08:49.120 --> 02:08:53.200]  because yeah i'm glad gab mcginnis reminded me i was reading that this morning this guy was from
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:09:01.440]  iran he was in his lawn assist but they found something that he had proof of that he quoted
[02:09:02.000 --> 02:09:06.160]  it's in paul's article a guy in a turban from the 1880s
[02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:14.560]  and they're calling that a neo-nazi hitler took over the national socialist workers party
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:22.880]  in the late 1920s when it was a little bit of group when he got killed in 1945 people that
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:28.080]  rekindled nazism were called neo-nazis neo-nazis didn't exist until 1946
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:39.040]  not 1890 but this is the incredibleness of even the hill the hill ran a piece saying that i created
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:43.760]  the russia gay conspiracy last week i didn't even cover it day but night did i mean that's the new
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:53.360]  level like alex jones and his russia gay had been disproven yes i was the target of it but
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:59.440]  we're reaching levels of deception i've never even imagined i mean it's just so over the top
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:04.960]  remember a few weeks ago alex jones lost the lawsuit on sandy hook for a book he wrote i never
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:10.320]  read the book didn't write the book didn't lose a lawsuit they had a public interest supreme court
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:15.760]  come down during their fake lawsuits and shut it down and say he's being railroaded one out of 5000
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:20.960]  and they're hearing basically a thing to throw it all out right now at the supreme court of
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:29.280]  connecticut that's not a defeat but they don't care like propaganda like the hanoi tokyo rose
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:35.680]  bagdad bob saying when when bagdad was falling in 2003 that that they'd driven us into the ocean
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:42.960]  we have beat the americans they are in the sea they are in kawaii f16 flies by drops a bomb behind
[02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:47.200]  him here's paul joseph watch this report that will be back your phone calls are coming up i'll give
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:53.520]  the number out next segment stay with us why is orange man bad today because orange man is racist
[02:10:53.520 --> 02:10:59.440]  residents of baltimore maryland are angry trump has called their city quote a disgusting rat and
[02:10:59.440 --> 02:11:05.040]  rodent infested mess rat infested mess sounds like trump is describing baltimore as if it was
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:10.800]  a third world country and who apart from a disgusting racist would describe baltimore as if it was
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:18.320]  like a third world country you would think that you were in a third world country oh wow this is
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:24.400]  awkward unbelievable that we have a president of the united states who attacks american cities you
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:30.560]  would think that you were in a third world country attacks american cities right bernie because next
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:35.280]  thing you know racist trump will be telling us that residents of the poorest areas of baltimore
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:41.760]  have shorter lifespans than north koreans oh that was you but bernie sanders is just another old
[02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:47.680]  white guy i mean it's not as if there are african-american mares in baltimore talking on camera about
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:54.480]  how baltimore is a rat infested mess is it oh we should just take all this down oh you can smell
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:12:00.560]  the rats oh you can smell the rats again awkward but it's not like baltimore residents are on tape
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:06.320]  repeatedly complaining about rats and rodents is it living in this house of all this tell me
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:12.400]  i didn't hear rats and rodents he told me i was lying cool oh my goodness that's great that's calm
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:17.040]  it says he told me i was lying it was no rats and rodents he just didn't want to pay oh van and
[02:12:17.040 --> 02:12:23.760]  roe homes sometimes filled with rodents trashed out back oh cnn especially post victor blackwell
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:30.400]  he's saying that trump is racist for calling out uh representative Elijah Cummings for the
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:37.360]  way his district looks and just for pointing it out basically do you agree trump is not racist
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:42.720]  not to my knowledge i'm glad that he pointed out i'm glad that he put him on blast because
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:47.600]  people in west baltimore have been putting Elijah Cummings on him on blasts for years
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:51.360]  ever since he's been in the office he never did anything for us like i said if he's supposed
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:57.600]  to be from this neighborhood like i said supposed to be it's just the rats just didn't come these
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:13:02.240]  houses just didn't get bored out they've been like this if he would take the time out to come over
[02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:11.200]  here and see how things are maybe he'd be better at his job oh but it's not as if the african-american
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:16.160]  woman who posted these videos is now getting harassed by leftists for proving trump right
[02:13:16.160 --> 02:13:23.200]  right is it but it's not as if the african-american woman who posted these videos is getting attacked
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:31.440]  as a racist by cnn is it kimberley clackick who went to impoverished parts of west baltimore
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:36.400]  and made videos of trashed lots and ruined row homes with clearly racist connotations
[02:13:37.200 --> 02:13:43.200]  oh but is baltimore even that bad i mean it's not as if pbs had an entire documentary just
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:51.200]  last year that was devoted to baltimore's rat problem is it oh it's not as if animal planet
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:14:00.880]  listed baltimore as the third worst rat-infested city in the world is it animal planet is racist
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:06.480]  who knew but it's not as if the baltimore son repeatedly drew attention to the city's rat and
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:12.560]  trash problem only to completely reverse their position when trump drew attention to it is it
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:20.160]  oh but it's not as if the baltimore son published a story in 2016 called trump's right declare baltimore
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:28.560]  a disaster and rebuild it is it uh yeah yeah they did trump is only attacking baltimore because
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:33.920]  a lot of black people live there it's not as if trump has referred to other mostly white areas
[02:14:33.920 --> 02:14:40.800]  of america like new hampshire in similar terms by describing them as drug-infested dens is it
[02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:47.760]  yeah yeah he did but trump's so racist he's now calling baltimore crime-ridden oh really why just
[02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:55.520]  because a lot of black people live there uh oh and oh yeah oh oh again so let's get this straight
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:15:01.200]  trump's racist for pointing out that baltimore has problems with crime trash and is rat-infested
[02:15:01.200 --> 02:15:07.280]  but the leftists who immediately thought of black people via word association when they saw trump
[02:15:07.280 --> 02:15:14.960]  tweet the words rat-infested they're the anti-racists wow i mean wow did you just use the word infested
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:20.400]  this term immediately makes me think of black people if you can't see how that makes you racist
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:25.760]  then you are beyond hope at this point but hold on a minute on a flight back to baltimore flight
[02:15:25.760 --> 02:15:33.040]  attendant welcomes passengers flying to the spectacular beautiful amazing city passengers tear
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:40.720]  that's right a flight attendant said some words on a plane and the passengers cheered rats trash
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:49.520]  crime problem solved trump owned racism ended impeachment guaranteed it's just incredible

[02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:31.920]  i want to finish up the latest on the whole baltimore fiesta which again is bigger than just
[02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:38.320]  another collapsed democrat run city where the services and everything is softened off by the
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:44.080]  establishment where the rich in the community have set up local laws to pay no taxes and the
[02:20:44.080 --> 02:20:51.600]  impoverished population is managed this is the same system they run everywhere and the locals
[02:20:52.240 --> 02:20:57.600]  know this in dallas texas that's run by democrats they know this in chicago run by democrats they
[02:20:57.600 --> 02:21:03.120]  know this in baltimore maryland they know this in san francisco they know this in seattle we shot
[02:21:03.120 --> 02:21:08.560]  so many live videos about a year and a half ago when i went to visit some of my wife's family
[02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:14.560]  who lives outside seattle beautiful we flew on float plane up to canada looked at the orcas
[02:21:14.560 --> 02:21:20.560]  beautiful area but seattle was covered with human feces needles just all over the place we were
[02:21:20.560 --> 02:21:24.880]  staying at the western hotel pretty nice you know like a three and a half star hotel there were
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:31.040]  needles out front at uh crack pipes i mean i wasn't looking for this it's like i was having to dodge
[02:21:31.040 --> 02:21:38.960]  feces and every 50 feet somebody screamed f u i'm gonna kill you dump coffee on my head you name it
[02:21:39.520 --> 02:21:43.600]  until the point my wife people didn't want to go outside so we just basically left early
[02:21:44.960 --> 02:21:48.960]  but the reason i raised that is when i go by the homeless things they go hey alex jones i'm on
[02:21:48.960 --> 02:21:52.800]  heroin i got addicted god i wish everyone would have done it this place man they only give me
[02:21:52.800 --> 02:21:56.640]  enough money to stay on the heroin and then they get the left to give money for the city
[02:21:56.640 --> 02:22:02.640]  programs but all these leptis groups siphon it off i wish i could get off the drugs these people
[02:22:02.640 --> 02:22:10.160]  were smart the people on heroin were smarter than the leftists running around because they're the
[02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:15.360]  ones that are pooping on the streets themselves not even the homeless because it's all about being
[02:22:15.360 --> 02:22:21.200]  bad it's all about defiling things and if you're not like them you just don't get it so you think
[02:22:21.200 --> 02:22:28.160]  it's not possible but no this is what's going on they're creating this and i don't just say this
[02:22:28.160 --> 02:22:37.120]  to be patronizing it's reality because i'm not politically correct in the 1920s 30s until the
[02:22:37.120 --> 02:22:43.680]  40s of the world war two blacks had lower illegitimacy on average national average and whites
[02:22:43.680 --> 02:22:48.880]  now they're up at 80 percent whites are at about 40 percent nothing against single moms but you're
[02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:52.320]  five times more likely for your kid to end up in prison three times more likely to be on drugs
[02:22:53.680 --> 02:22:57.840]  i mean hell two parents with all the jobs we got it's hard to run tanks and hard to make ends me
[02:22:59.360 --> 02:23:05.120]  these people are poverty pimps and they know what they're doing and they're running systems
[02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:10.240]  on purpose and i don't want to quote his letters that are public that lbj is the one that created
[02:23:10.240 --> 02:23:19.360]  the great society where they paid black women not to have men in the house and to just have more
[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:24.000]  babies out of wedlock well you got to any community you're going to get the breakdown of society
[02:23:25.360 --> 02:23:30.960]  and so now they've gone from what was it seven percent illegitimacy in the black community
[02:23:32.560 --> 02:23:37.760]  in 60 something years it's now at 80 percent or higher in some areas but the national average
[02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:46.480]  about 80 percent 80 percent white illegitimacy was at about 10 percent back then it's up and
[02:23:46.480 --> 02:23:56.080]  get almost 50 that's break down folks and he said man these black people because suppressing
[02:23:56.080 --> 02:24:00.480]  black people made them build their own factories their own hotels their own everything their own
[02:24:00.480 --> 02:24:04.880]  restaurants their home area and and and the establishment got pissed not just because they
[02:24:04.880 --> 02:24:08.320]  were black but because they had their own economy that which doesn't kill you makes you stronger i'm
[02:24:08.320 --> 02:24:13.280]  not defending segregation but like niches said that which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger
[02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:22.480]  and lbj said we're going to have these uppity inwards vote and democrat for 100 years and you've
[02:24:22.480 --> 02:24:29.200]  had them for 60 now i mean there's so many of these quotes these are in letters they're the
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:35.200]  national archives by the way this is not spewed they told folks we got something free for you
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:41.120]  remember pinocchio that's all white kids getting caught to be corrupt hired by thugs and then
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:46.080]  they turn into jackasses and put on a slave ship that's a quick allegory of you think these
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:49.440]  corrupt guys are giving you a whiskey at the pool hall and having you do some robberies
[02:24:50.560 --> 02:24:54.080]  once they get you into the system they're enslaving you
[02:24:54.080 --> 02:25:02.160]  you they know what they're doing and along comes trump not liking it
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:08.800]  and like trump said a few years ago what the hell do you got to lose man
[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:15.200]  and trump's been fighting like hell to have real affirmative action of factories and jobs
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:20.640]  and things to the inner city communities and you know the regular enlisted is full of minorities
[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:26.640]  trumps fought to get their pay doubled he only got part of that you know i know a lot of people in
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:32.640]  the military people that are sergeants and even above that and the biggest thing is they their
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:36.960]  wife's working a job they're overseas and they can't even pay their medical bills and they're in
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:41.280]  the military trumps tried to fix that that's the biggest thing you can do for this country millions
[02:25:41.280 --> 02:25:47.040]  and millions of enlisted people and you know he's gotten the pay increased a lot obama fought
[02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:52.640]  increase in that pay because they want to keep you down i don't want to keep you down
[02:25:54.800 --> 02:25:59.280]  but that's what this whole system is info wars believes in a pro human future i don't want to
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:04.080]  abort black babies or white babies or any other babies but that doesn't mean because i'm white
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:08.000]  i'm gonna hear about your racist leftist that happen to have brown skin tell me how i'm bad
[02:26:08.000 --> 02:26:10.800]  how i'm supposed to kiss your racist ass that ain't happening either
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:18.160]  so let's go ahead and go to trump speaks outside marine one this morning about
[02:26:18.160 --> 02:26:24.800]  baltimore here it is but if that's the case they're fighting against their people because the african
[02:26:24.800 --> 02:26:30.640]  american people have been calling the white house they have never been so happy as what a president
[02:26:30.640 --> 02:26:36.640]  has done not only the lowest unemployment in history for african americans not only opportunity
[02:26:36.640 --> 02:26:42.000]  zones for worthy of thinking at the biggest beneficiary of the inner city and not only
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:50.640]  criminal justice reform but they're so happy that i pointed out the corrupt politics of baltimore
[02:26:50.640 --> 02:26:58.400]  it's filthy dirty it's so horrible and they are happy as hell so you may have a couple of politicians
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:05.760]  boycott but it's all a fix it's all a fix the fact is african american people love the job i'm
[02:27:05.760 --> 02:27:09.120]  doing because i'm working for them i'm not working for the politicians
[02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:18.720]  trump's hair is even more spectacular back in about half a second i was on the

[02:40:24.640 --> 02:40:28.720]  20 something million dollars around this place a year and so we may bring in 40 million dollars but
[02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:33.840]  that's product we only make half that we discount stuff so much and and then after everything's
[02:40:33.840 --> 02:40:37.920]  said and done they're suing us to try to shut us down we're fighting and holding our ground

[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:48.000]  take action during this we've done a money bombing years we've done some fundraisers and we have to do

[02:40:52.480 --> 02:40:57.440]  i want to win that's a great graphic stop the clown store wide mega cell but we should probably
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:02.560]  change that to uh joe biden and camilla harris put their faces up there as clowns we already have
[02:41:02.560 --> 02:41:07.680]  that made up okay let's go to some phone calls and milley weaver's on the other side let's go to uh
[02:41:09.280 --> 02:41:14.320]  carlos in canada got about a minute and a half carlos thanks for calling go ahead hi alex
[02:41:14.320 --> 02:41:19.840]  uh thank you very much uh just just to prove for once and for all that president trump is not a
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:25.840]  racist and that this is just a trick to people think of voting only against the white man because
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:34.400]  obviously president trump it's not other than the occasion october 7th 1999 on cnn larry king posed
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:40.480]  the question why he was considering running for president and who would be his vice president vice
[02:41:40.480 --> 02:41:46.960]  presidential choice and he said opera would always be my first choice for vice president
[02:41:47.680 --> 02:41:51.200]  now if a candidate is financing his own campaign for president
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:57.920]  and if he's a racist the white supremacist or any other kind of kkk or whatever why would he
[02:41:57.920 --> 02:42:04.800]  abandon his base his foundation the people that would go for him by having a vice president whose
[02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:09.520]  opera win free is sure and the word is he called her you know he said this he called her and she
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:13.120]  wouldn't even return the call it was i saw in one newspaper like rap when he was getting ready to
[02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:18.160]  run she just wouldn't do it he said fine you know whatever but obviously she'd be a total
[02:42:18.160 --> 02:42:24.000]  one in combo that you couldn't beat that that's a really smart move but but yeah you've heard of a
[02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:29.360]  slow laurist attack it's where in hacking you'd ask to shake hands with your computer network
[02:42:29.360 --> 02:42:32.400]  over and over again and your computer getting ready to make that handshake goes through a
[02:42:32.400 --> 02:42:35.440]  bunch of computing it's like putting your hand out but then pulling it back and putting it through
[02:42:35.440 --> 02:42:40.080]  your hair so that you keep going you're a racist we respond to that you're a racist that we respond
[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:45.280]  to that to just keep us all balanced always responding to it great points carlos all right
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:49.280]  millie weaver coming up then more of your phone calls at all those that watch the robert barnes
[02:42:49.280 --> 02:42:58.240]  and more it's the clown world we're just living in it it's happening now right now all over the
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:03.280]  world humanity is fighting back against the transhumanist globalist world government mark of
[02:43:03.280 --> 02:43:08.320]  the beast agenda and the forces of evil are trying to censor and suppress the tip of the

[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:21.520]  we've developed up and into orbit and to take action at the next level the globalist now we've
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:25.840]  already devastated them and they hope that you don't take action because when you support info

[02:43:55.760 --> 02:43:59.840]  robert barnes what does big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become big bullies
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:04.240]  and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of social economic political or legal
[02:44:04.240 --> 02:44:08.640]  for their illicit activities over two decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges
[02:44:08.640 --> 02:44:12.480]  the juries the members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary members
[02:44:12.480 --> 02:44:16.640]  of the public and the audience that care about this have to bring real social political economic
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:20.480]  consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[02:44:20.480 --> 02:44:25.040]  big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran american politics and
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:29.520]  ran american economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the great depression
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:34.960]  the info wars audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty across the world to make
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:39.600]  real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of an independent
[02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:44.080]  free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:48.320]  to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling
[02:44:48.320 --> 02:44:52.320]  us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw
[02:44:52.320 --> 02:44:59.040]  isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw i talk about this on the air and i
[02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:03.120]  know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're gonna kind of reboot all our supplements
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:07.200]  in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits
[02:45:07.200 --> 02:45:10.960]  the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were the best and why
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:14.880]  they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good and instead the last
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:18.720]  few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:21.840]  like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were and
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:27.200]  the left always has headlines everywhere jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims
[02:45:27.200 --> 02:45:33.120]  are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say that a supplement has been through
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:37.040]  the fda because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say
[02:45:37.040 --> 02:45:41.520]  it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature
[02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:45.440]  and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects
[02:45:45.440 --> 02:45:50.400]  not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing about god's medicine chest info
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:59.200]  or store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine

[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:18.240]  all of us are one group has devastated the globalist can you imagine where we'd be in this fight
[02:48:18.240 --> 02:48:23.280]  right now against the left and their lies and saying don't say america or the american flag
[02:48:23.280 --> 02:48:29.360]  and pulling it off nike and the nfl and all this other stuff up the creek without a paddle
[02:48:31.200 --> 02:48:33.520]  and this ain't a happy creek this is a you know what creek
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:44.400]  an sh you know what creek and so this is life and death man i'll give my life for this fight
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:50.640]  i don't give a rat's ass about status or money but let me tell you i used to be somebody
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:57.200]  you're gonna be waving your calls who 15 years ago i've been on there 10 years they were trying
[02:48:57.200 --> 02:49:01.920]  to shut me down and demonizing me and coming after my family and they were in the news saying
[02:49:01.920 --> 02:49:04.800]  alex jones does this for money and back then
[02:49:09.840 --> 02:49:17.440]  i was i was i was hurt by that i mean i live at a pretty modest you know middle class house and i
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:22.240]  drive a 30 000 car and i put almost all the money back into my company that's how we've grown it and
[02:49:22.880 --> 02:49:29.920]  i said i'll show you i'll really grow and we did we exploded and that got their attention we changed
[02:49:29.920 --> 02:49:36.320]  the world together but it doesn't matter money's not a bad thing it's that i won't sell out for money
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:43.520]  i don't care about the trappings of things i wear a rolex because my dad gave me one 10 years ago
[02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:50.160]  and then two other people once i wore one gave me one and a few years ago i gave my dad a green
[02:49:50.160 --> 02:49:54.320]  rolex like i've got and you know what it fits good and i like it these watches are popular
[02:49:54.880 --> 02:49:58.640]  because damn they're nice and they feel good and they just fit right there's something timeless
[02:49:58.640 --> 02:50:04.960]  about it but i don't give a damn about the symbolism of a rolex i drive a forward f150 pickup because
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:15.360]  i like it i could drive a ferrari but i don't want that i want money to kick the globalist ass and
[02:50:15.360 --> 02:50:20.640]  you know if i've ever got if i've ever downed my last dollars and i've got a pay to put an ad in
[02:50:20.640 --> 02:50:24.320]  the newspaper to fight the globalist i'll sell this rolex my dad gave me 10 years ago
[02:50:24.320 --> 02:50:31.200]  and i'll sell the other two people gave me but you know what this rolex wouldn't run this place
[02:50:31.200 --> 02:50:35.760]  for six hours the cost we have to run it just the bandwidth and the crew and all this rolex is
[02:50:35.760 --> 02:50:45.520]  nothing but it's also a symbol of timelessness and how the british 500 years ago paid a huge sum
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:50.640]  for the first person that could create a clock that worked for the military and it's not digital
[02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:56.000]  it's not some globalist silicon contraption it's machine working that the human mind made
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:58.400]  and it's amazing not an ad for rolex or not a sponsor
[02:51:00.640 --> 02:51:04.320]  the point is is that we're not doing money bombs for rolexes around here
[02:51:05.200 --> 02:51:10.320]  we're doing money bombs around here i got a tag my dad gave me 20 years ago still works takes batteries
[02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:20.880]  though when did my dad give me that rolex he gave me that rolex when when my second
[02:51:21.760 --> 02:51:26.000]  daughter was born but but i'm gonna go to millie weaver then i'm gonna go to your calls and paul
[02:51:26.000 --> 02:51:30.160]  was just coming up and i apologize i'm just i'm just going off on this jag about i love america
[02:51:30.160 --> 02:51:35.520]  i love freedom i love justice and i hate seeing our cities fall like baltimore and and and and
[02:51:35.520 --> 02:51:40.640]  detroit and i hate seeing the lies the globals i want to seem defeated and we're so close and now
[02:51:40.640 --> 02:51:48.480]  they're striking back with everything they've got because they don't want to see their lives
[02:51:48.480 --> 02:51:52.400]  countered because if their lives are countered they're going to fail and that's why this operation
[02:51:52.400 --> 02:51:58.160]  is so special that's why i want to think every single listener for what you've done because
[02:51:58.160 --> 02:52:04.160]  you've changed the world and those aren't words that really happened millie weaver in front of
[02:52:04.160 --> 02:52:08.000]  the fox theater you're going to be more on with the war room you're going to be on tonight live
[02:52:08.000 --> 02:52:14.080]  during the debate after the debate doing interviews with folks as they come out give us your observation
[02:52:14.080 --> 02:52:19.200]  of detroit of the fox theater and what you think is coming up tonight well thanks alex we've been
[02:52:19.200 --> 02:52:25.200]  out here for a couple hours now and i will say there's zero enthusiasm people just don't seem to
[02:52:25.200 --> 02:52:31.840]  be very enthused as you can see right behind me we have the fox theater and over here on this side
[02:52:31.840 --> 02:52:37.760]  we have cnn's media tent now cnn is putting on this entire event here and look at this
[02:52:37.760 --> 02:52:42.960]  area where supporters are allowed to come fill in look how many people are there alex there's
[02:52:42.960 --> 02:52:49.600]  like a dozen people there i mean if this were the gop if this were trump coming to speak
[02:52:49.600 --> 02:52:54.880]  you would have this packed there would be lines everywhere the democrats can't draw a crowd even
[02:52:54.880 --> 02:52:59.280]  with all of these candidates they're still not drawing a crowd and they're not drawing any
[02:52:59.280 --> 02:53:05.120]  enthusiasm i think this speaks volumes and look at all this money behind cnn cnn's got this huge
[02:53:05.120 --> 02:53:11.120]  media pit they've got cnn advertisements everywhere it's like cnn has written their name all over
[02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:17.760]  this event yet look how many people actually care that cnn is here and want to even see the cnn news
[02:53:17.760 --> 02:53:22.640]  pundits or go there to support them and stand behind them as they report it just goes to show
[02:53:22.640 --> 02:53:28.640]  they've got all this money they're being backed by these billionaires like george soros the pharmaceutical
[02:53:28.640 --> 02:53:33.920]  industry they're not actually backed by the american people and that's very evident in
[02:53:34.640 --> 02:53:39.440]  just coming out to these events and showing you and and showing this is what we're up against
[02:53:39.440 --> 02:53:44.880]  we're up against big pharma and big billionaires that want to line the pockets of the democrats
[02:53:44.880 --> 02:53:50.400]  and of cnn meanwhile they don't have the american people behind them they have to try to lure them
[02:53:50.400 --> 02:53:55.680]  like a bunch of lemmings and sheep off the cliff into supporting these democrats who have failed
[02:53:55.680 --> 02:54:01.360]  policies wow you know that's really the central theme when you were in miami a few weeks ago
[02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:05.920]  was it a month ago now there was no one there you're out there they all just looked depressed
[02:54:05.920 --> 02:54:11.520]  there was like 20 demonstrators for the democrats and like a couple hundred trump supporters it looks
[02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:17.440]  like a replay of that so far well it looks like there's actually going to be some protesters so
[02:54:17.440 --> 02:54:22.400]  some liberals are actually going to be protesting the democrat debates here in detroit that's
[02:54:22.400 --> 02:54:26.720]  going to start at around 4 p.m eastern time and we are going to be covering that as well and you
[02:54:26.720 --> 02:54:32.320]  can find that coverage on my twitter feeds millie weaver on twitter or millennial millie on youtube
[02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:37.760]  we're going to be covering that but there's probably going to be more liberals protesting the
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:42.880]  democrat debates and there will be out here just supporting it and these are going to be climate
[02:54:42.880 --> 02:54:48.560]  change activists that are mad these are people that they want the green new deal they want these
[02:54:48.560 --> 02:54:55.600]  really radical extreme left policies and they're demanding that these democrats kneel to the green
[02:54:55.600 --> 02:55:00.960]  new deal essentially and that's why they're protesting sure well that's the soros globalist
[02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:04.640]  funded deal because if they get the carbon tax they can track every human activity totally control
[02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:08.640]  everything they admit that so so they're so you're gonna have a leftist rena mob acting like
[02:55:08.640 --> 02:55:14.800]  they're not leftist enough i expect to see them really as the media said pull out the long knives
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:19.680]  on joe biden because he's the presumptive leader but even trump said it looks like he is the candidate
[02:55:19.680 --> 02:55:26.000]  if he can quote make it because the word is he's so low energy stuttering sputtering i mean i wonder
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:31.840]  if he's gonna know who he is tonight yeah i think that joe biden is definitely the establishment
[02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:36.240]  pic i've been saying for over a year now that they're gonna try to have joe biden maybe pop in
[02:55:36.240 --> 02:55:41.440]  with having michelle run as a vice president so that they can try to corral the black vote in america
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:48.640]  uh we saw obama biden trending today on twitter the day of the debates now it was trending because
[02:55:49.360 --> 02:55:54.480]  of a fake news satirical tweet that said some outlandish quote that wasn't even true about
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:59.920]  something representative jim jordan said but it just goes to show look their names are trending
[02:55:59.920 --> 02:56:05.840]  today on the debate biden is the establishment pic it's who they're gonna try to shove through
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:10.640]  whether the democrats like it or not and this is what we're gonna be up against but see they're
[02:56:10.640 --> 02:56:18.320]  trying to kill morale gm the auto manufacturer we know that detroit is a major hub for auto
[02:56:18.320 --> 02:56:23.040]  manufacturing gm has announced and they just did a press conference some of the democrats earlier
[02:56:23.040 --> 02:56:29.040]  this morning that gm is closing down more of their factories and moving them to maxico incredible
[02:56:29.920 --> 02:56:35.440]  and let's add this trying to demoralize people in the swing state they're hitting swing state areas
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:39.680]  and shutting down their factories there so that they can say trump's policies have failed and i
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:45.600]  think gm is hedging their bets that trump will lose and then they can still be in mexico and they
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:50.320]  won't have to be hit by tariffs or be punished for selling out you're right that that is completely
[02:56:50.320 --> 02:56:53.760]  outrageous that they do that but just like the fake jim jordan quote they put out that will cover
[02:56:53.760 --> 02:56:58.960]  when we come back with paul watson and callers um they know that a certain percentage of people will
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:03.360]  get emotional get mad and even when they find out it's not true they still have that hate for the
[02:57:03.360 --> 02:57:08.080]  person like they've done to me like they've done to trump saying that trump called black people
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:12.800]  rats i mean i saw one williamson on fox news this morning he knows damn well that's not true
[02:57:12.800 --> 02:57:17.680]  so it's just so dangerous what they're doing millie well i grew up with trump supporters and
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:23.200]  i'm going to be volunteering as well have volunteered to go to baltimore in august and
[02:57:23.200 --> 02:57:26.800]  they're going to be doing a trash pickup so you're going to have maga hat wearing trump supporters
[02:57:26.800 --> 02:57:30.480]  out there in baltimore doing and i think trump should come to that i think he should tour blue
[02:57:30.480 --> 02:57:34.400]  cities and and call for initiatives to help folks millie we were great job you'll be popping
[02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:39.760]  in the war rooms throughout the 40 hour broadcast that we're now already but we're already like
[02:57:39.760 --> 02:57:43.760]  six hours into it stay with us hour number four straight ahead with paul watson your call stay
[02:57:43.760 --> 02:57:48.400]  with us let's talk to marcus in new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding hey outlook
[02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:52.720]  yeah i just want to say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out
[02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:57.600]  in new york city and one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think
[02:57:57.600 --> 02:58:02.240]  that the neocons are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's
[02:58:02.240 --> 02:58:07.120]  the only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's
[02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:10.960]  it i mean if trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he
[02:58:10.960 --> 02:58:15.040]  could be defeated other than assassinating him it's a time to be praying my friend i agree entirely
[02:58:15.040 --> 02:58:18.720]  and the last thing i just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the
[02:58:18.720 --> 02:58:23.600]  reinforcements have arrived man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old i'd love
[02:58:23.600 --> 02:58:28.000]  to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into
[02:58:28.000 --> 02:58:33.520]  this war you won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who

[03:00:12.240 --> 03:00:15.840]  i like the buffet i overate here there's too many of you to get to everybody but
[03:00:15.840 --> 03:00:18.400]  after he leaves at three o'clock we're not open phones though in shroyer
[03:00:19.520 --> 03:00:22.960]  but know this bottom line we love you to death because you're not taking it lying down
[03:00:23.680 --> 03:00:28.000]  and even better than that we're winning ladies and gentlemen it's a beautiful time to be alive
[03:00:31.360 --> 03:00:35.200]  now i want to hit a point that paul octas pointed out at info wars.com and his article on the summit
[03:00:35.200 --> 03:00:43.120]  dot news media label book garlic festival shooter cited a neo nazi manifesto the book was written
[03:00:43.120 --> 03:00:50.000]  in 1890 neo nazis didn't exist till hitler died in late 1945 you can go read that in
[03:00:50.800 --> 03:00:56.720]  time life encyclopedia on it but i happen to pull off my own office shelf this is a volume 24
[03:00:57.280 --> 03:01:01.120]  my parents bought me this when i was seven years old you can go read all about it
[03:01:01.120 --> 03:01:07.120]  but see you're not supposed to actually know the history while even knowing about the nazis
[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:13.520]  they're even banning books and stuff on facebook and youtube about and videos about the nazis saying
[03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:21.680]  they're bad isn't that amazing and then now we've learned that this individual wasn't islamist all
[03:01:21.680 --> 03:01:29.440]  evidence shows from iran and the guy he praises wasn't islamist but see that's how this works now
[03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:34.080]  that's who supposedly shot up the garlic festival that ties in to chase the patriot says there's
[03:01:34.080 --> 03:01:37.920]  yeah they're having new warnings against christian nationalist and fbi director ray
[03:01:38.720 --> 03:01:42.800]  up to his eyeballs and all this stuff he says whites are the ones doing all the terror
[03:01:42.800 --> 03:01:48.240]  he calls a hundred crimes committed by whites terror but all the statistics show that's not
[03:01:48.240 --> 03:01:52.480]  even true it's just it's incredible so so chase the chase the patriot he's still there he's just
[03:01:52.480 --> 03:01:57.360]  hang up because i was just going to him just drop boom that happened sometimes i was talking
[03:01:57.360 --> 03:02:04.000]  to jameson in new jersey about taking action go ahead hey hey brother go ahead hello welcome
[03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:13.280]  yeah uh first off i want to say hashtag uh big tech big pupils um hashtag big tech big pupils
[03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:20.160]  that's the hashtag yeah uh we need to get off this timeline alex uh i want to give a quick
[03:02:20.160 --> 03:02:27.120]  plug every morning i i uh wake up start with x2 and a shot at secret 12 and that's helped bring
[03:02:27.120 --> 03:02:32.800]  my dad back from low t after uh prostitutes technically and i want to thank you for that
[03:02:32.800 --> 03:02:37.040]  well sir these are the best pure as strong as supplements out there just briefly what they
[03:02:37.040 --> 03:02:43.760]  do for your dad what happened uh they had to induce low t uh because they had to go in with
[03:02:43.760 --> 03:02:50.000]  radiation to follow up after the prostatectomy sure and uh then you know testosterone helps
[03:02:50.000 --> 03:02:54.720]  grow tumors they want to get rid of it they had to shut it all down and if basically they
[03:02:54.720 --> 03:03:01.040]  chemically castrated them they use the same uh stuff they use on little kids uh huh yeah well
[03:03:01.040 --> 03:03:09.840]  yeah pretty much i guess and uh which is freaky uh and uh so he that's like inducing almost like
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:16.960]  Alzheimer's the way it affects everything oh yeah and he he really bottomed out and uh to the point
[03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:22.720]  where the doctor even remarked like this is your wow this is pretty low um and it was it was due to
[03:03:22.720 --> 03:03:29.040]  come back within hopefully six months and it was like okay anytime now and we just we just got
[03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:37.840]  aggressive with the you know nutraceuticals and uh the x2 and secret 12 and uh the bio-trustillinium
[03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:41.840]  was part of it the whole the whole thing was just trying to you know just throw everything and that's
[03:03:41.840 --> 03:03:49.680]  all great preglonone in the real red pill bottle yeah that's that was that came out after the fact
[03:03:49.680 --> 03:03:54.080]  by the way i can't take our real red pill plus it makes my test scope so high that turned into king
[03:03:54.080 --> 03:04:01.520]  kong i mean it's like this is the real deal i mean i my hair starts falling out i go crazy i'll
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:06.800]  start losing weight i can't even take it you know preglonone is is they're even trying to ban it
[03:04:06.800 --> 03:04:12.960]  as a drug but it's a precursor to all the hormones so you add that with x2 so it's powerful i'm gonna
[03:04:12.960 --> 03:04:16.720]  come back to you briefly and go to paul watch they want you to be able to finish your point jamison
[03:04:16.720 --> 03:04:22.320]  but but thanks for the plug stay there don't hang up man i'm just tempted i'm gonna be up here at
[03:04:22.320 --> 03:04:27.440]  seven o'clock tonight hosting the whole deal and after where the gab mcginnis and others and paul's
[03:04:27.440 --> 03:04:32.400]  coming up you know he's a great guy always sought after to get on air a lot of great points paul
[03:04:32.400 --> 03:04:37.600]  just watches take it over we got laura in france we got chase the patriot we his back we've got
[03:04:37.600 --> 03:04:41.840]  chris in forest and eric and craig i i i don't know what i'm gonna do because i've got paul
[03:04:41.840 --> 03:04:46.800]  watch them on one hand and all these red calls and the other paul watchin looks like he's a little
[03:04:46.800 --> 03:04:52.640]  angry too right now but he's ready he is loaded for bear he is in flago you notice paul's on fire
[03:04:52.640 --> 03:04:59.200]  right now before i started working at info wars i was not only a fan of alex jones and info wars
[03:04:59.200 --> 03:05:04.160]  dot com but also the products at info wars store dot com and there's one product that's offered at
[03:05:04.160 --> 03:05:10.000]  info wars store dot com that is the elite of the supplements and that's dna force plus now i remember
[03:05:10.000 --> 03:05:15.200]  when alex first started talking about this with some of his special guests telomeres and telomere
[03:05:15.200 --> 03:05:21.040]  support with your dna and so i started to look into the science and what telomeres were and how
[03:05:21.040 --> 03:05:26.720]  it can improve your health and longevity when you protect your telomere so i started looking into
[03:05:26.720 --> 03:05:33.280]  dna force plus but it's expensive why because it is an elite supplement and then i started seeing
[03:05:33.280 --> 03:05:38.560]  other competitors coming up with competitive supplements for telomere support and they came
[03:05:38.560 --> 03:05:45.360]  and they went but dna force plus is still there it is the elite supplement i get excited when dna
[03:05:45.360 --> 03:05:51.680]  force plus is on sale because i know it's expensive so you should take advantage of 50 off dna force
[03:05:51.680 --> 03:06:10.080]  plus at info wars store dot com from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:06:22.640 --> 03:06:25.360]  so the story and we're told
[03:06:26.560 --> 03:06:37.120]  i don't need your prayers is true save a few for left it to he only did what he had to do
[03:06:40.960 --> 03:06:49.200]  and now he's growing old paul joseph watson is ready he's in the bullpen he's about to come out
[03:06:49.200 --> 03:06:56.320]  and just a few minutes so be sure and tune in for that and tell everybody you know again the power

[03:07:31.200 --> 03:07:37.760]  debate if if i'm not struck down by lightning and we'll get you on air as well uh but jameson's
[03:07:37.760 --> 03:07:41.840]  in new jersey you were saying getting trump to take action that's what i'm obsessed with go ahead
[03:07:41.840 --> 03:07:49.600]  that we he he is not the second coming and so we he's not gonna save us and we can't beg him
[03:07:49.600 --> 03:07:55.440]  or curse him out and make him do it we have to make him do it he's the right man in the right
[03:07:55.440 --> 03:08:01.520]  time to do the bidding of our act you know our will and no i agree he's not the second coming
[03:08:01.520 --> 03:08:06.160]  and and he means well but he's surrounded by a bunch of cowards who are being attacked and
[03:08:06.160 --> 03:08:12.080]  threatened so they won't execute jack crab but his his hair is spectacular his hair is amazing
[03:08:12.720 --> 03:08:18.800]  um have you seen it lately up to five inches sticking out i saw that this is cartoon character
[03:08:18.800 --> 03:08:25.440]  level i love it um but what we the way we do it this is our john hancock moment okay we need a
[03:08:25.440 --> 03:08:30.240]  declaration we need to put together a declaration of no confidence in the fairness of the 2020
[03:08:30.240 --> 03:08:35.840]  general election and a resolution to peacefully disrupt and obstruct through all available means
[03:08:35.840 --> 03:08:44.400]  of non-violent civil disobedience and thereby invalidate the 2020 election if if by this november
[03:08:44.400 --> 03:08:52.800]  2019 a year out with time to turn it around he has not reached uh platforms and given speechback
[03:08:52.800 --> 03:09:00.480]  online so that the the only way this isn't civil war at 2020 is if we can get the moderate
[03:09:00.480 --> 03:09:06.960]  democrats who are not seeing what we see and seeing the truth to see the truth by getting
[03:09:06.960 --> 03:09:11.600]  through the blockade online and we have to we have to promise that we're going to make a mess
[03:09:11.600 --> 03:09:15.600]  out of it and it's that a big tech is allowed to meddle and we're going to meddle right back
[03:09:15.600 --> 03:09:20.720]  and absolutely jameson i appreciate your call laura and france and paul joseph watches taking
[03:09:20.720 --> 03:09:27.840]  over go ahead laura hello alex thank you so much for taking the call um just to say we we love your
[03:09:27.840 --> 03:09:34.720]  show we love trump um and just the other day we were speaking about the 5g and trump was talking
[03:09:34.720 --> 03:09:39.360]  the other day about giving it to the farmers first and you know it's going to be the the biggest thing
[03:09:39.360 --> 03:09:45.280]  going in america etc good for the economy we're just worried because it's so dangerous and we
[03:09:45.280 --> 03:09:51.120]  wondered you know is he going to do this another way and then change things because it's just so
[03:09:51.120 --> 03:09:55.760]  extreme that people aren't being given a choice and this 5g is coming whether we like it or not
[03:09:55.760 --> 03:10:01.280]  um and i just want to listen he's trump is a caveman uh and that's kind of a good thing in
[03:10:01.280 --> 03:10:06.720]  some ways it's not i mean even drudge under my article yesterday saying we've got to get trump
[03:10:06.720 --> 03:10:11.200]  to not commit political suicide and stop the censorship drudge literally posted under a
[03:10:11.200 --> 03:10:16.480]  political admitting that trump watches tv and reads newspapers he thinks the internet's like

[03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:58.720]  genitals i'm sure it's very necessary i mean doesn't there come a time when the trade off between
[03:13:59.280 --> 03:14:04.560]  higher speed internet and this kind of thing kind of cancels it out who needs higher speed
[03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:10.640]  internet i mean unless you didn't high quality graphic processing if you're making a movie why
[03:14:10.640 --> 03:14:15.280]  does anyone need speeds of that excess i haven't researched 5g i don't actually know if it's gonna
[03:14:15.280 --> 03:14:21.680]  fry everyone's brains but i'd be very cautious about it oh no even even the la times all the
[03:14:21.680 --> 03:14:26.640]  studies it massive brain cancer yeah it every cancer you know it resonates right at the speed
[03:14:26.640 --> 03:14:34.560]  to to you know microwaves rub molecules together right yeah i'm a lot of people have been warning
[03:14:34.560 --> 03:14:38.960]  about it i haven't researched it myself but yeah well let me tell you the studies are out 30 years
[03:14:38.960 --> 03:14:45.680]  ago regular cell phone radiation it's not even as fast as 5g causes dna to break because it
[03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:53.520]  rubs the molecules together and it raises brain temperature up to one degree what do you make of

[03:15:07.360 --> 03:15:12.160]  people don't care about them they routinely receive the least traffic if you write a story about it or
[03:15:12.160 --> 03:15:16.320]  if you make a video about it so people have completely sacrificed every every last shred of
[03:15:16.320 --> 03:15:21.840]  privacy they exactly paul remember we first broke that they were listening and watching to us in 2005
[03:15:21.840 --> 03:15:31.120]  remember that yeah all right paul joseph Watson just explosively emotional responding to everything

[03:20:18.960 --> 03:20:26.960]  and we are live with clownworld coverage of the upcoming democratic presidential debates
[03:20:26.960 --> 03:20:33.440]  again being held what a year and a half before the actual election way too early um you've
[03:20:33.440 --> 03:20:39.920]  basically got 18 candidates up there saying orange man bad over and over again compared to
[03:20:39.920 --> 03:20:46.000]  probably two in andrew yang and tulsi gabard who actually talk about real policies and real issues
[03:20:46.000 --> 03:20:52.560]  and in fact tulsi gabard tweeted yesterday her support for online free speech across the board
[03:20:53.200 --> 03:20:58.960]  for all americans no matter their political persuasion that question's not going to come up
[03:20:58.960 --> 03:21:04.400]  in tonight's debates and tomorrow night's debates i would imagine but what questions are going to
[03:21:04.400 --> 03:21:13.120]  come up is the question of giving free healthcare free paid for by american taxpayers to potentially
[03:21:13.120 --> 03:21:18.160]  tens of millions of illegal immigrants going to come up again because basically all of the main
[03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:23.280]  candidates again apart from those two that i mentioned have either openly advocated for that
[03:21:23.840 --> 03:21:29.120]  or not disavowed it people are now experts have looked at this and saying it could collapse the
[03:21:29.120 --> 03:21:34.080]  entire economy because you would get a flood of illegals coming over you would incentivize them to
[03:21:34.080 --> 03:21:42.240]  come over will the issue of free healthcare which bernie sanders said he supported but illegal aliens
[03:21:42.240 --> 03:21:46.800]  despite previously saying that you can't have a big welfare state with open borders
[03:21:46.800 --> 03:21:51.520]  so he's completely flipped will that issue come up will the issue of baltimore come up
[03:21:51.520 --> 03:21:57.520]  given that it's now officially racist to point out that baltimore is the most dangerous city in
[03:21:57.520 --> 03:22:04.240]  america even though it is to point out that some areas of baltimore are like living in third world
[03:22:04.240 --> 03:22:10.720]  countries which again bernie sanders said back in 2015 but now he says trump's racist for saying
[03:22:10.720 --> 03:22:19.760]  similar things in 2019 will that issue come up i retweeted steve guest about 15 minutes ago who
[03:22:19.760 --> 03:22:26.240]  tweeted this add this to things you can't make up a rat ran through a fox 45 baltimore reporter's
[03:22:26.240 --> 03:22:32.960]  live shot during a story on president trump's tweet so they were actually doing a live shot of
[03:22:32.960 --> 03:22:38.800]  some rubbish outside a residential block in baltimore talking about how president trump needs
[03:22:38.800 --> 03:22:44.560]  to visit the area before spouting lies about baltimore and literally in the middle of this shot
[03:22:44.560 --> 03:22:52.400]  a giant rat scuttles out from behind the garbage and runs across the shot of the camera will that
[03:22:52.400 --> 03:22:59.840]  issue come up will democrats be forced to defend baltimore as the apparently beautiful amazing
[03:22:59.840 --> 03:23:07.600]  utopia that it now is after president trump criticized it usa today reports the president
[03:23:07.600 --> 03:23:13.920]  is right about baltimore are democrats really prepared to defend failure yes that democrats
[03:23:13.920 --> 03:23:20.160]  are now the party of rodent infested messes apparently the article makes the point that
[03:23:21.200 --> 03:23:26.080]  president barack obama said then that difficult conditions in baltimore required national
[03:23:26.080 --> 03:23:32.960]  soul searching let's bear in mind the fact that after these tweets the state of baltimore has
[03:23:32.960 --> 03:23:38.800]  been blamed on donald trump's racist rhetoric they're literally blaming the chronic state of
[03:23:38.800 --> 03:23:44.080]  baltimore which has been like that for decades on president trump's tweets despite the fact
[03:23:44.080 --> 03:23:52.480]  that barack obama spent 1.8 billion in stimulus on the city of baltimore and as this usa today
[03:23:52.480 --> 03:23:58.960]  columnist admits it didn't seem to solve anything the baltimore son is out saying that trump's a
[03:23:58.960 --> 03:24:04.880]  massive racist and a hypocrite and a liar for saying that baltimore's in a terrible state
[03:24:05.600 --> 03:24:13.760]  kind of contradicts with their op-ed from september or november sorry 2016 which said trump's right
[03:24:13.760 --> 03:24:20.800]  declared baltimore a disaster and rebuild it now they're singing a very different tune so will it
[03:24:20.800 --> 03:24:27.040]  come up in the debates tonight especially as this happened just a few days ago baltimore's new
[03:24:27.040 --> 03:24:33.440]  deputy police commissioner gets mugged at gunpoint again in this crime-free utopia
[03:24:33.440 --> 03:24:38.000]  you're not in louis louisiana anymore a new deputy police commissioner in baltimore got a first hand
[03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:42.720]  lesson in the city's crime problems getting robbed at gunpoint while out with his wife according to
[03:24:42.720 --> 03:24:48.080]  reports deputy commissioner daniel murphy had only started with the force in april after being
[03:24:48.080 --> 03:24:55.120]  brought in from new orleans he was robbed at nine p.m friday before men in a white suv and so he has
[03:24:55.120 --> 03:25:01.840]  experienced the crime-free utopia of baltimore at first hand in one of his first days on the job
[03:25:03.520 --> 03:25:09.280]  there's an article up at bright bar by nick nulltey john nulltey sorry entitled
[03:25:10.080 --> 03:25:16.800]  elijah comings blames baltimore's problems on trump and racism as i said before the reason
[03:25:16.800 --> 03:25:21.440]  that baltimore's been in such a terrible dreadful state is because donald trump tweeted about it
[03:25:21.440 --> 03:25:27.920]  last week that's how it all began nothing to do with those hulking rotting apartment blocks that
[03:25:27.920 --> 03:25:33.280]  are now basically trash dumps infested with rats and have been for decades now it all started with
[03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:42.000]  donald trump's tweets last week he makes the point of this here's a look at baltimore city council
[03:25:42.000 --> 03:25:47.680]  where nine out of 15 council members and the council president a city-wide elected position
[03:25:47.680 --> 03:25:54.560]  are black and of course they're all every single one of them a democrat here's a look at baltimore's
[03:25:54.560 --> 03:25:59.280]  mayor a black man and naturally a democrat here's a look at the guy who represented baltimore for
[03:25:59.280 --> 03:26:05.680]  36 years 13 years as a state representative and 23 years in the u.s. house of representatives
[03:26:06.400 --> 03:26:13.520]  since 1987 baltimore's only had one mayor who was not black since the office of city council
[03:26:13.520 --> 03:26:20.080]  president was established in 1923 almost a hundred years ago the office has never been
[03:26:20.080 --> 03:26:26.720]  held by a republican but of course donald trump is to blame for the state of baltimore because
[03:26:26.720 --> 03:26:33.440]  of his tweets last week but apparently if that is the gauge if that's the metric by which we
[03:26:33.440 --> 03:26:41.040]  declare something racist then google is now racist too headline up at summit dot news first google
[03:26:41.040 --> 03:26:48.160]  search suggestion baltimore is a dumb now you know how much google likes to game its algorithm
[03:26:48.160 --> 03:26:56.080]  and its search results to both alter and dictate reality i've pointed out many times before i think
[03:26:56.080 --> 03:27:01.600]  they've changed it back now but as of about two weeks ago if you searched my full name
[03:27:02.240 --> 03:27:09.200]  and youtube on google you would expect to get the first result my youtube channel and it wasn't
[03:27:09.200 --> 03:27:15.840]  even on the first page as of last week it was somebody doing an impression of me on youtube
[03:27:15.840 --> 03:27:19.760]  that's an example of how they've gained their algorithm we know they've gained it
[03:27:20.560 --> 03:27:26.240]  preceding national elections like the um and referendums like the abortion referendum in island
[03:27:26.240 --> 03:27:32.000]  to place pro abortion content above pro life content to literally game the results of an
[03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:39.280]  election dr robert epstein has proven that that can shift millions of votes on election day but
[03:27:39.280 --> 03:27:45.200]  now president trump has been labeled racist for his criticisms of baltimore and yet the first google
[03:27:45.200 --> 03:27:52.320]  autocomplete suggestion to come up when one searches for baltimore is is baltimore is a dumb
[03:27:53.120 --> 03:27:59.360]  now i tried this this morning over here in the uk and that was true for this first search term the
[03:27:59.360 --> 03:28:05.520]  first search autocomplete suggestion when you type in baltimore is to google is baltimore
[03:28:05.520 --> 03:28:11.120]  is a dump now other people in america have typed in and got baltimore is a mess baltimore is rat
[03:28:11.120 --> 03:28:17.120]  infested baltimore is a slum baltimore is crime infested whether they changed it after that came
[03:28:17.120 --> 03:28:22.320]  out last night remains to be seen because when you search it now there are neutral or positive
[03:28:22.320 --> 03:28:30.320]  results below but still the last time i checked baltimore is a dump was the first suggestion
[03:28:30.320 --> 03:28:35.600]  being suggested by google when you use that search term so i guess we have to conclude
[03:28:36.240 --> 03:28:41.840]  the only conclusion to make is that just like donald trump google is racist and google is to
[03:28:41.840 --> 03:28:48.480]  blame for all the problems in baltimore this is clown world usa live coverage we'll be back up to

[03:34:53.440 --> 03:35:00.720]  this broadcast now yesterday in germany we had another example of cultural enrichment
[03:35:01.840 --> 03:35:07.120]  where a tragic incident happened where a mother and her eight-year-old son were pushed off the
[03:35:07.120 --> 03:35:13.280]  train tracks were pushed onto the train tracks at frankfort train station in germany an update on
[03:35:13.280 --> 03:35:17.920]  that from bright bar erotrain migrant held on murder charge over railway death of child has
[03:35:18.640 --> 03:35:24.320]  psychiatric problems now of course this guy was running around the train station trying to push a
[03:35:24.320 --> 03:35:29.520]  bunch of people onto the tracks tragically the mother and the son got pushed onto the tracks
[03:35:29.520 --> 03:35:36.480]  the mother was able to squeeze in between the tracks and save herself the eight-year-old boy was
[03:35:36.480 --> 03:35:42.080]  less fortunate and he was hit by a high speed what they call ice train that was pulling into
[03:35:42.080 --> 03:35:48.720]  the station and unfortunately died suddenly now an erotrain man suspected of fatally pushing
[03:35:48.720 --> 03:35:53.600]  a eight-year-old boy in front of a train at frankfort's main station had undergone psychiatric
[03:35:53.600 --> 03:35:59.280]  treatment recently is being sought by swiss police after threatening a neighbor the 40-year-old who
[03:35:59.280 --> 03:36:04.640]  was lived in switzerland for over a decade and three small children hasn't yet given any explanation
[03:36:04.640 --> 03:36:09.840]  for a possible motive for the killing that has horrified germany they were talking about another
[03:36:09.840 --> 03:36:17.200]  incident in germany where they claim a right winger had shot an erotrain migrant so they were
[03:36:17.840 --> 03:36:21.920]  speculating as to whether it was some kind of revenge attack doesn't appear to be so just
[03:36:21.920 --> 03:36:27.840]  appears to be a completely random murder the man whose name has not been released was chased by
[03:36:27.840 --> 03:36:34.000]  passersby including an off-duty police officer and arrested near the station the nature of the
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:38.000]  crime raises the possibility of mental illness and psychiatric assessment will be conducted
[03:36:38.000 --> 03:36:42.400]  swiss authorities later told reporters the man had undergone psychiatric treatment this year and
[03:36:42.400 --> 03:36:48.640]  apparently had been involved in other violent crimes so we'll continue to monitor that story but
[03:36:48.640 --> 03:36:55.920]  also in germany upon summit dot news today german swimming pool forced to introduce id checks to
[03:36:55.920 --> 03:37:01.840]  stop harassment by migrant youths throughout the summer and of course we've had a heat wave in
[03:37:01.840 --> 03:37:08.960]  europe for certainly part of this summer so far swimming pools across germany have had major
[03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:15.120]  problems with in some cases gangs of hundreds of migrant youths from north african countries
[03:37:15.760 --> 03:37:21.360]  the same countries by the way that the perpetrators of the cologne mass molestation on new years eve
[03:37:21.360 --> 03:37:28.480]  2015 came from swimming pools across germany having big problems with the harassment rowdy
[03:37:28.480 --> 03:37:36.000]  behavior riotous behavior migrant youths starting fights at these public swimming pools and particularly
[03:37:36.000 --> 03:37:42.960]  wanted doussled off which they had to call the police numerous times they had to hire six security
[03:37:42.960 --> 03:37:48.800]  guards to patrol this one public swimming pool because they were getting so much trouble from
[03:37:48.800 --> 03:37:54.640]  these migrant youths from north african countries those six security guards couldn't handle it and
[03:37:54.640 --> 03:38:00.560]  they had to call police this is not the first time this has happened 20 police officers showed up
[03:38:00.560 --> 03:38:05.920]  and they had to close the pool down once again now a swimming pool in german city of dusseldorf
[03:38:05.920 --> 03:38:11.200]  the same one has been forced to introduce mandatory id card checks in an effort to stop sexual
[03:38:11.200 --> 03:38:16.960]  assaults and rowdy behavior by migrant youths they had a crisis summit between administrators the
[03:38:16.960 --> 03:38:22.160]  mayor and the police chief and they introduced an online ticket system linked to people's ids to
[03:38:22.160 --> 03:38:27.920]  control who is allowed to enter the pool how are they going to actually manage that remains to be
[03:38:27.920 --> 03:38:33.600]  seen because they're not going to be able to deny people entry to the pool based on their
[03:38:33.600 --> 03:38:40.800]  nationality because that would cause a nationwide scandal and of course they'd be accused of racism
[03:38:40.800 --> 03:38:45.200]  so i don't exactly know how they're going to control the amount of people maybe they're just
[03:38:45.200 --> 03:38:50.320]  going to do it on a number system where only a certain amount of people are allowed in the pool
[03:38:50.320 --> 03:38:56.160]  anyone time maybe they're going to do it that way but the mayor of dusseldorf thomas geisel said in
[03:38:56.160 --> 03:39:00.480]  rheinbad we have introduced an identity card for all visitors those who do not comply will not be
[03:39:00.480 --> 03:39:05.760]  let in it is absolutely unacceptable and inconceivable that families who want to spend their free time
[03:39:05.760 --> 03:39:14.480]  here are harassed by youth gangs this controversy in tandem with the tragic case of the eight-year-old
[03:39:14.480 --> 03:39:20.960]  boy being pushed on the train tracks as again restarted the debate over migration in germany and
[03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:26.880]  i think even somebody who was in angela merkel's party said this would cause them again to look at
[03:39:26.880 --> 03:39:31.760]  reducing the amount of migrants from north africa who are allowed into the country so
[03:39:31.760 --> 03:39:38.240]  these two stories in tandem have really reignited that debate but as we reported earlier this month
[03:39:38.240 --> 03:39:44.960]  the pool had to be closed twice after hundreds four hundred male migrants how they were even
[03:39:44.960 --> 03:39:50.720]  allowed to get in in the first place harassed a family prompting a huge police depot deployment
[03:39:50.720 --> 03:39:55.760]  and then last friday the pool had to be cleared out again there's around 60 north african migrants
[03:39:55.760 --> 03:40:01.120]  began engaging in aggressive behavior outnumbered the six security guards on patrol had to call for
[03:40:01.120 --> 03:40:06.880]  police backup 20 officers arrived and the pool was closed voice of europe commented quote it
[03:40:06.880 --> 03:40:11.600]  should be known that before the migrant crisis german swimming pools didn't need six security
[03:40:11.600 --> 03:40:18.080]  guards to maintain order it's likely that they didn't need any or you'd think that six security
[03:40:18.080 --> 03:40:25.440]  guards would be enough to maintain order at a local public swimming pool apparently not so now
[03:40:25.440 --> 03:40:31.840]  they're having to try something different meanwhile over in iran women stalked and harassed for not
[03:40:31.840 --> 03:40:39.680]  wearing a hijab of course in the west through the hijab barbie through the nike hijab olympic
[03:40:39.680 --> 03:40:45.440]  headgear the islamic headdress is not only being normalized but is being celebrated as a symbol
[03:40:45.440 --> 03:40:51.360]  of feminism we've highlighted that over and over again when you actually go to the middle east
[03:40:51.360 --> 03:40:57.040]  it's the women who are removing their hijabs who are being brutally harassed on the street
[03:40:57.040 --> 03:41:02.560]  incarcerated arrested tortured now we have a video out of iran which shows a woman
[03:41:03.360 --> 03:41:07.040]  who apparently wasn't wearing her hijab it's not clear if she's wearing it or not
[03:41:07.040 --> 03:41:13.920]  or if it just slipped because in some cases if somebody sees it slip then they call the
[03:41:13.920 --> 03:41:19.280]  religious morality police and then they get harassed for that reason of course in indonesia
[03:41:19.280 --> 03:41:25.760]  and some of these countries they literally have gangs of cops roaming around in squad cars looking
[03:41:25.760 --> 03:41:30.560]  for women who are not wearing their hijabs correctly similar to what isis does in isis
[03:41:30.560 --> 03:41:36.880]  controlled areas of iraq and syria again looking to harass potentially arrest these
[03:41:37.680 --> 03:41:42.720]  brave women many of whom are not even engaging in a protest they just accidentally let their
[03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:49.040]  hijab slip of course others who did engage in protest in one case one was hit with
[03:41:49.040 --> 03:41:56.240]  20 years in prison for removing her veil during a protest if you actually go back to the
[03:41:56.960 --> 03:42:01.920]  original arab feminist groups in the middle east and i've done several videos about this
[03:42:01.920 --> 03:42:08.560]  there was one called the egyptian feminist union they were around in the 1920s as the first
[03:42:09.120 --> 03:42:14.800]  arab muslim feminist group in the middle east what was the first act of defiance
[03:42:14.800 --> 03:42:21.520]  that they used to symbolize their movement while it was to remove the hijab now people in iran
[03:42:21.520 --> 03:42:27.200]  more than ever it seems are getting harassed in prison tortured for doing so but in the west
[03:42:27.200 --> 03:42:32.320]  we're told that it's this marvelous symbol of feminism to the point where the resistance the
[03:42:32.320 --> 03:42:39.760]  anti-trump resistance as we've seen uses it on their posters to symbolize their brave patriotic
[03:42:39.760 --> 03:42:45.600]  resistance even though it's a symbol the subject subjugation oppression incarceration
[03:42:46.160 --> 03:42:52.400]  brutalization of women across the middle east absolutely incredible we'll be back clown world
[03:42:52.400 --> 03:42:58.880]  live don't go away it's never been easy to figure out the essentials of a new supplement routine

[03:47:34.800 --> 03:47:39.280]  and will they talk about identity politics obviously will they talk about orange man bad
[03:47:39.280 --> 03:47:44.480]  obviously that's literally all they've got to say apart from two of the candidates the other 18
[03:47:44.480 --> 03:47:50.640]  are going to be on that all night beto or rock has got some african-american athlete
[03:47:50.640 --> 03:47:55.200]  so uh inspired by calling cap and it he's got them in the audience apparently so
[03:47:55.200 --> 03:48:00.000]  i'm sure he'll be doing a shout out to them but is it going to translate as a successful
[03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:07.040]  election strategy saying orange man bad over and over again and continually hyping the cult of
[03:48:07.040 --> 03:48:14.080]  diversity which brings me to this story from summit dot news dccc executive director forced
[03:48:14.080 --> 03:48:20.240]  to resign because she's white this actually happened democratic congressional campaign
[03:48:20.240 --> 03:48:25.840]  committee executive director allison jaslow fell on her sword for the sake of diversity
[03:48:25.840 --> 03:48:32.240]  after she was forced to resign for being white she's an iraq war veteran and she attended an
[03:48:32.240 --> 03:48:37.920]  all-staff meeting on monday to make it official after two hispanic lawmakers demanded she stepped
[03:48:37.920 --> 03:48:46.080]  down for not doing enough to diversify the d triple c so they literally said this organization at
[03:48:46.080 --> 03:48:52.080]  the top is too white your why for that reason because of your skin color you're going to have
[03:48:52.080 --> 03:48:58.320]  to step down claiming the organization's incomplete chaos the lawmakers demanded chairwoman cherry
[03:48:58.320 --> 03:49:04.560]  bustos quote a point a qualified person of color of which there are many as executive director
[03:49:04.560 --> 03:49:10.240]  at once how about just to point the person who is best qualified regardless of skin color
[03:49:10.240 --> 03:49:16.480]  you know judging them on their character their experience their skills and not their skin color
[03:49:16.480 --> 03:49:23.680]  as the great martin luther king once said who would now be derided as an uncle tom sell out
[03:49:23.680 --> 03:49:29.760]  by this new beaverish hysterical progressive left that's racist martin luther king's racist
[03:49:29.760 --> 03:49:38.880]  so she actually she actually held a meeting with the staff during which she cried and
[03:49:38.880 --> 03:49:44.000]  apologized so she was literally blubbering and crying and apologizing for being white
[03:49:44.560 --> 03:49:50.880]  and not supporting diversity strongly enough she so subsequently submitted her resignation on her
[03:49:50.880 --> 03:49:58.880]  birthday before releasing a statement on twitter in which she again genuflected and blubbered about
[03:49:58.880 --> 03:50:04.640]  being too pale and stale apparently and even democrats appeared to be shocked by the development
[03:50:05.360 --> 03:50:11.760]  one tweeted quote you had to resign because you're white this is why they blew it in 2016 so even
[03:50:11.760 --> 03:50:16.000]  some of them realized that the identity politics though it may work longer term with changing
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:22.080]  demographics doesn't look like it's going to work this time around another one said it's not reverse
[03:50:22.080 --> 03:50:28.560]  discrimination this is just straight up discrimination another one said happy birthday sorry
[03:50:28.560 --> 03:50:36.480]  you're white so she literally had to resign not just resign but apologize and cry in front of her
[03:50:36.480 --> 03:50:44.160]  entire staff for the crime of being white this is the new democratic party this is the direction
[03:50:44.160 --> 03:50:48.320]  in which they've chosen to head whether that's going to translate into an election victory
[03:50:49.040 --> 03:50:56.080]  remains very much in doubt meanwhile jeffrey epstein an economist has predicted that he will
[03:50:56.080 --> 03:51:02.480]  be killed in jail now this is interesting because this prediction the initial prediction was made
[03:51:02.480 --> 03:51:08.000]  before he sustained those jail injuries last week which of course the media claimed was a
[03:51:08.000 --> 03:51:14.160]  potential suicide bid but there was no real evidence for that in fact the cellmate who
[03:51:14.160 --> 03:51:21.040]  epstein is being detained with at least before he's convicted claimed that he had earbuds in and
[03:51:21.040 --> 03:51:27.600]  didn't hear the commotion didn't hear somebody or epstein himself trying to choke him so if you
[03:51:27.600 --> 03:51:31.920]  believe that you believe anything but now the economist martin armstrong has predicted that
[03:51:31.920 --> 03:51:37.360]  jeffrey epstein will never see a trial because he will be killed in jail to hide connections to
[03:51:37.360 --> 03:51:43.440]  powerful people who are complicit in his sex trafficking crimes armstrong notes that epstein
[03:51:43.440 --> 03:51:49.040]  is being housed in the 10 south unit in new york city otherwise known as the whole or america's
[03:51:49.040 --> 03:51:55.040]  guantanamo where terrorists are kept to quote cut them off from the world with no regular access
[03:51:55.040 --> 03:52:03.600]  to visits or telephones so the conditions are so bad that suicides by desperate federal inmates
[03:52:03.600 --> 03:52:10.160]  are not uncommon so they may be trying to drive epstein to suicide but then armstrong notes also
[03:52:10.160 --> 03:52:15.920]  quote inmates are often killed by others as a cover-up so the government can blame them but
[03:52:15.920 --> 03:52:21.280]  strangely they managed to get some sort of deal and he's suggesting that epstein's cellmate who
[03:52:21.280 --> 03:52:29.120]  faces a death penalty may indeed get one of those deals if he's complicit in or turns a blind eye
[03:52:29.120 --> 03:52:34.240]  to epstein's suicide and of course this prediction as i said was made before he sustained those
[03:52:34.240 --> 03:52:39.520]  injuries which the media claim was a potential suicide bid given the number of high-profile
[03:52:39.520 --> 03:52:43.680]  people who will be embroiled in the fallout armstrong asserts quote i do not believe that
[03:52:43.680 --> 03:52:49.920]  epstein will ever see a trial he will be killed one way or another epstein will hang himself so
[03:52:49.920 --> 03:52:55.520]  they will say will be killed by a fellow inmate who will take the blame for time off his bid
[03:52:56.320 --> 03:53:02.480]  now of course and cool to last week we reported that she's advising the bureau of prisons to
[03:53:02.480 --> 03:53:08.320]  move jeffrey epstein to a supermax facility so that quote the people who want him dead won't
[03:53:08.320 --> 03:53:14.240]  be able to hide their complicity in his sex trafficking crimes and as armstrong notes it goes
[03:53:14.240 --> 03:53:20.720]  way above just the um clinton angle given the amount of powerful names in his special little
[03:53:20.720 --> 03:53:26.640]  black book that are potentially going to be exposed as a result of this trial will he ever make it
[03:53:26.640 --> 03:53:31.680]  to trial well according to one of the victims lawyers that's probably not going to happen
[03:53:31.680 --> 03:53:37.280]  headline epstein in danger of being murdered by powerful people before his trial says victims
[03:53:37.280 --> 03:53:44.240]  lawyer this is spencer cuvin who told the sun newspaper quote i question whether whether
[03:53:44.240 --> 03:53:48.880]  or not it was a true suicide attempt that mr. epstein was involved in or whether or not there
[03:53:48.880 --> 03:53:54.640]  may be some powerful people who just don't want him to talk he questioned how epstein could have
[03:53:54.640 --> 03:53:59.120]  choked himself adding there's no doubt in my mind that no jail will protect you when there's powerful
[03:53:59.120 --> 03:54:03.920]  people that want to reach you wherever you are and he actually mentioned a similar case
[03:54:03.920 --> 03:54:09.840]  probably not involving underage children but a sex trafficking case nonetheless which
[03:54:09.840 --> 03:54:16.320]  was a 1959 case called the profumo affair where socialite steven ward this was in britain
[03:54:16.880 --> 03:54:22.160]  was part and trial for procuring young women for the british elite but killed himself before
[03:54:22.160 --> 03:54:27.920]  the verdict was announced so a very similar situation where he had a list of clients very
[03:54:27.920 --> 03:54:34.240]  high up in the british establishment who did not want to get exposed and he ended up dead this
[03:54:34.240 --> 03:54:38.080]  lawyer for the victim said quote we know that mr. ward who was involved in that affair and the
[03:54:38.080 --> 03:54:43.520]  procurement of women for some notable people was given bail and commit suicide while out on bail
[03:54:43.520 --> 03:54:47.760]  so it'll be interesting to see whether or not mr. epstein attempts again to set out on bail and if
[03:54:47.760 --> 03:54:55.680]  he does whether he survives between now and the day of his trial interestingly enough mr. cuvin
[03:54:55.680 --> 03:55:03.280]  the lawyer for epstein's victim one of them noted that these kind of eyes wide shut style sex parties
[03:55:03.280 --> 03:55:10.320]  attended by masked men most of them of course elitist as we saw somewhat infamously in eyes
[03:55:10.320 --> 03:55:17.600]  wide shut the Stanley Kubrick film back in the late 90s have been taking place for over 50 years
[03:55:17.600 --> 03:55:23.040]  and of course the epstein sex trafficking ring is the perfect example of that and
[03:55:23.040 --> 03:55:29.280]  and if you've seen the movie then the fate that awaited some of those characters in that movie
[03:55:29.280 --> 03:55:37.120]  could potentially await epstein himself according to that lawyer meanwhile two Somali refugees
[03:55:37.120 --> 03:55:43.920]  arrested for planning icis attack inside us one of them had a residency permit the other one
[03:55:43.920 --> 03:55:52.160]  was still characterized clarified as an eth a refugee and they were basically caught trying
[03:55:52.160 --> 03:55:58.320]  to travel to Egypt to join icis and to carry out terror attacks in Egypt the plan was if they'd
[03:55:58.320 --> 03:56:04.320]  failed to get out of the country they were going to commit an icis inspired terrorist attack inside
[03:56:04.320 --> 03:56:11.040]  the United States they tried to board a flight at Tucson international airport in Arizona
[03:56:11.040 --> 03:56:17.760]  but were caught by FBI agents because again as per usual people sometimes people call this
[03:56:17.760 --> 03:56:24.640]  entrapment but this is what the FBI does they pose as icis recruitment agents to try and ferret
[03:56:24.640 --> 03:56:31.280]  out these people once they start talking to them then they close the net so those two refugees
[03:56:31.280 --> 03:56:38.320]  have been arrested planning a terror attack meanwhile journalists fired from contributing
[03:56:38.320 --> 03:56:45.120]  to npr over antifa activism you've got to give props to npr they've actually established
[03:56:45.120 --> 03:56:51.360]  themselves at least with this act as a journalistic outfit and not an activism outfit because a
[03:56:51.360 --> 03:56:57.600]  columnist at teen vogue has been dumped from her position as a contributor to npr over her ties
[03:56:57.600 --> 03:57:04.400]  to an antifa which of course donald trump suggested that they're considering characterizing as a
[03:57:04.400 --> 03:57:09.280]  domestic terrorist group he made that tweet over the weekend so she's on twitter whining about the
[03:57:09.280 --> 03:57:15.120]  fact that she got canned by npr well don't support a domestic terrorist group whose members literally
[03:57:15.120 --> 03:57:21.840]  tried to massacre a bunch of ice agents and then maybe your journalistic credibility will be more
[03:57:21.840 --> 03:57:29.360]  respected by the likes of npr but i'm sure there's a cushy job waiting for kim kelly over at cnn who
[03:57:29.360 --> 03:57:35.360]  of course have repeatedly failed to denounce antifa as have much of the democratic party
[03:57:35.360 --> 03:57:40.160]  and the progressive left that's going to wrap it up for this segment i'm sure it is coming up live
[03:57:40.160 --> 03:57:45.360]  clown world dot us live debate coverage don't go away george arwell said that in a time of
[03:57:45.360 --> 03:57:50.560]  universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act and so used to it wasn't that important to
[03:57:50.560 --> 03:57:55.040]  wear the american flag because we've still loved our country and there wasn't a large group of people
[03:57:55.040 --> 03:58:00.160]  that actually hated it but now they're trying to take it out of schools they're taking it down off
[03:58:00.160 --> 03:58:04.640]  of government buildings weird white leftists that want a virtue signal are pulling down american
[03:58:04.640 --> 03:58:09.840]  flags and running up mexican flags this is the bizarreness of the america hating we're seeing
[03:58:09.840 --> 03:58:14.480]  so now it is a revolutionary act in the time of incredible deceit and oppression and bullying
[03:58:14.480 --> 03:58:20.480]  to wear the american flag particularly the betsy ross anti-slavery flag and particularly when it
[03:58:20.480 --> 03:58:26.320]  says on the back right there ladies and gentlemen america's back in full wars dot com so whatever
[03:58:26.320 --> 03:58:31.920]  you do take action today and exercise your free speech in these bullies face all over not just the
[03:58:31.920 --> 03:58:36.720]  u.s but worldwide because more than ever the american flag is a symbol of freedom against globalism
[03:58:44.240 --> 03:58:51.200]  as we gather this evening in the joy of freedom we remember that all share a truly extraordinary
[03:58:51.200 --> 03:58:57.840]  heritage together we are part of one of the greatest stories ever told the story of america
[03:58:57.840 --> 03:59:05.040]  it is the epic tale of a great nation whose people have risked everything for what they know is right
[03:59:05.600 --> 03:59:13.280]  and what they know is true as long as we stay true to our cause as long as we remember our great
[03:59:13.280 --> 03:59:21.040]  history as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future then there will be nothing
[03:59:21.040 --> 03:59:31.840]  that america cannot do
