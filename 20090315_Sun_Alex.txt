[00:31.040 --> 00:36.360]  Next on News Radio 590.
[00:36.360 --> 00:39.720]  Hi, our in-USA Radio News, I'm Jody Jordan.
[00:39.720 --> 00:43.600]  With interest rates sitting at a record low and the economy still reeling from the financial
[00:43.600 --> 00:48.840]  fallout, analysts aren't expecting any changes to come after the Federal Reserve policymakers
[00:48.840 --> 00:50.880]  meet this week.
[00:50.880 --> 00:55.320]  President Obama says the notion that the U.S. and Europe are taking sides with America pushing
[00:55.320 --> 01:00.360]  for more stimulus spending in Europe and nations favoring tighter regulation of the financial
[01:00.360 --> 01:02.600]  industry is a phony debate.
[01:02.600 --> 01:07.760]  In my mind at least, there is no conflict or contradiction between the positions of
[01:07.760 --> 01:10.800]  the G20 countries and how we're going to be moving forward.
[01:10.800 --> 01:13.240]  There's going to be differences in details.
[01:13.240 --> 01:14.560]  Those are being worked out right now.
[01:14.560 --> 01:16.560]  I expect to have a productive meeting.
[01:16.560 --> 01:22.000]  And Christina Romer, one of President Barack Obama's copy-economic advisors, tells NBC
[01:22.000 --> 01:29.200]  that while the U.S. is temporarily in a financial mess, the economy is fundamentally sound.
[01:29.200 --> 01:33.920]  This is IRN-USA Radio News.
[01:33.920 --> 01:37.120]  Men and women, if you've got 10 to 30 pounds or more to lose, please listen carefully.
[01:37.120 --> 01:38.840]  Guys, many of us tend to overeat.
[01:38.840 --> 01:41.280]  We eat too much red meat, fast foods and processed foods.
[01:41.280 --> 01:43.720]  This keeps the belly flabby and keeps our bodies overweight.
[01:43.720 --> 01:47.320]  Ladies, have you ever said, I feel fat today, or do you have this bloated feeling?
[01:47.320 --> 01:50.640]  And how many of you have been trying to lose the same 10 to 20 pounds for years?
[01:50.640 --> 01:53.560]  There's a healthy and faster way to lose weight than any diet pill.
[01:53.560 --> 01:57.000]  It's called Evercleans, a clinically proven weight loss and detox formula that helps you
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.120]  lose weight and get rid of the 5 to 25 pounds of weight that some experts say is trapped
[02:01.120 --> 02:03.240]  to the colon walls like spackle or paste.
[02:03.240 --> 02:05.640]  Two weeks of Evercleans may be equal to months of dieting.
[02:05.640 --> 02:06.640]  It's simple too.
[02:06.640 --> 02:09.200]  Natural, tasteless crystals that dissolve in any food or beverage.
[02:09.200 --> 02:12.120]  Evercleans will flatten out your midsection, reduce love handles, and bellies and bloating
[02:12.120 --> 02:13.840]  have been disappearing in just days.
[02:13.840 --> 02:17.360]  You see, Evercleans gets rid of the weight you can't take off by exercising or starving
[02:17.360 --> 02:18.360]  yourself on a diet.
[02:18.360 --> 02:20.560]  And it's not something you have to take for the rest of your life.
[02:20.560 --> 02:22.520]  Call now to receive a very special offer.
[02:22.520 --> 02:25.320]  Call 800-567-5598.

[02:29.120 --> 02:33.440]  That's 800-567-5598.
[02:33.440 --> 02:38.080]  The president's chief economic advisor says the bonus payment's given out to an American
[02:38.080 --> 02:40.520]  international group or outrageous.
[02:40.520 --> 02:45.120]  This whole area is something we're going to have to look at as we think about regulation
[02:45.120 --> 02:50.880]  in the future because no one can be satisfied with what's happened.
[02:50.880 --> 02:56.920]  Lawrence Summers told ABC that the troubled insurance giant got more than 170 billion
[02:56.920 --> 02:58.680]  in bailout money.
[02:58.680 --> 03:03.760]  And the weather is looking good for tonight's rescheduled launch of the space shuttle Discovery.
[03:03.760 --> 03:08.640]  Repairs have been made after a hydrogen gas leak scrapped liftoff plans Wednesday.
[03:08.640 --> 03:13.600]  The delay is shortened the mission by at least a day, increasing pressure for today's departure.
[03:13.600 --> 03:15.240]  This is NASA's George Stiller.
[03:15.240 --> 03:20.960]  Right now we are well past the point where our leakage problem developed on our first
[03:20.960 --> 03:26.920]  launch attempt and we are not seeing any indications of leakage at all.
[03:26.920 --> 03:33.040]  For the latest news and analysis, log on to IRNUSANews.com.
[03:33.040 --> 03:37.800]  With a word about Israel, here's bestselling author and Bible teacher Kay Arthur.
[03:37.800 --> 03:46.000]  If you could only visit one country, one nation on the face of this earth, it should be Israel
[03:46.000 --> 03:49.120]  because then you'll never be the same.
[03:49.120 --> 03:56.720]  To start planning your trip to Israel today, call 1-888-777-ISRAEL or visit www.goisrael.com.
[03:56.720 --> 04:08.120]  You'll never be the same.
[04:08.120 --> 04:10.520]  Sounds from Sunday services that resumed today at an Illinois church, one week after the
[04:10.520 --> 04:12.880]  senior pastor was gunned down.
[04:12.880 --> 04:17.760]  A minister from Texas talked to the congregation and spoke from his own experience.
[04:17.760 --> 04:22.880]  A decade ago, Agamon entered his Fort Worth church and killed seven people before committing
[04:22.880 --> 04:23.880]  suicide.
[04:23.880 --> 04:29.320]  OPEC oil ministers say they'll continue current output levels but try to end over production
[04:29.320 --> 04:31.480]  by some cartel members.
[04:31.480 --> 04:35.840]  Today's decision means there'll be no cutbacks from December production levels.
[04:35.840 --> 04:39.400]  Abdullah Saleem al-Badri is the OPEC secretary general.
[04:39.400 --> 04:44.320]  Taking into consideration what's going on in the world economy, everything we try to
[04:44.320 --> 04:50.000]  talk about, everything is negative, you know, every day we receive negative information
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.480]  so we just try to balance the situation out.
[04:53.480 --> 04:59.160]  In Israel is setting a deadline for a prisoner exchange with the Hamas rulers of Gaza.
[04:59.160 --> 05:00.160]  Here's Mark Levine.
[05:00.160 --> 05:05.160]  The clock is ticking down on a deal for release of an Israeli soldier held nearly three years
[05:05.160 --> 05:07.720]  by Hamas-linked militants in Gaza.
[05:07.720 --> 05:09.760]  Israel has set a special cabinet meeting for tomorrow.
[05:09.760 --> 05:14.720]  If there's no deal today, the prisoner issue will be turned over to the next government.
[05:14.720 --> 05:18.440]  Current government appears willing to free most of the prisoners Hamas is demanding,
[05:18.440 --> 05:20.280]  including convicted terrorists.
[05:20.280 --> 05:24.880]  The Benjamin Netanyahu, the incoming Israeli prime minister, takes a harder line against
[05:24.880 --> 05:27.120]  Hamas and Arabs in general.
[05:27.120 --> 05:28.120]  Mark Levine Jerusalem.
[05:28.120 --> 05:32.960]  And I'm Jody Jordan, frying our NUSA radio news.

[07:11.740 --> 07:13.280]  You're out, Melody.
[07:13.280 --> 07:22.600]  Hello and thank you for joining us. Glad that you have decided to tune in on this Sunday edition from 4 to 6 p.m.. Central Standard Time
[07:23.480 --> 07:27.640]  Here is the important news today that we'll be covering. It's particularly
[07:29.320 --> 07:31.320]  Shocking and revealing
[07:32.360 --> 07:40.160]  Cheney assassination units that's been reported by Cy Hirsch New Yorker magazine. He's also doing a piece for New Yorker magazine
[07:40.160 --> 07:41.960]  on
[07:41.960 --> 07:48.200]  government-sponsored terror that's coming up in the next few months and Vanity Fair and also writing a book and
[07:48.360 --> 07:53.920]  You know Cy Hirsch is a pillow surprise winner and he's never been proven wrong in the past
[07:54.280 --> 07:58.320]  Very very accurate. One of our best living journalists out there
[08:00.200 --> 08:03.920]  Well, he's been reporting on Cheney assassination unit
[08:04.200 --> 08:07.680]  But then we decided to write an article because of our knowledge of this
[08:07.680 --> 08:14.600]  So the story up on prisonplanet.com right now is Cheney assassination unit active under Obama
[08:15.640 --> 08:18.680]  Including domestically inside the United States
[08:20.360 --> 08:28.920]  Because the name of the assassination unit is the Joint Special Operations Command and its nickname is the Delta Force and
[08:29.640 --> 08:31.640]  In congressional testimony
[08:31.960 --> 08:36.560]  It was a declassified that Delta Force was there quote pulling triggers
[08:36.560 --> 08:42.360]  And they're the folks that went in with infantry maneuvers and the church records vaulted Waco
[08:42.880 --> 08:49.520]  Where the 30-something women and children were huddling and placed a plastic shape charge on the top of the building
[08:51.720 --> 08:55.920]  Killing all inside and of course machine gunning men as they tried to run out the back
[08:55.920 --> 08:59.760]  We had the flare footage of this and it's it's it's public knowledge
[08:59.760 --> 09:01.720]  But you won't see it on the nightly news though
[09:01.720 --> 09:06.920]  They do have documentaries that are on places like HBO Waco the rules of engagement and others
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.920]  The Flare project and others one of them nominated for an Academy Award
[09:12.800 --> 09:15.840]  but the the issue here is that
[09:18.240 --> 09:20.960]  Cheney certainly expanded their role and
[09:21.880 --> 09:27.000]  Did operate outside the purview of the Congress and the military itself?
[09:28.040 --> 09:29.400]  but
[09:29.400 --> 09:31.760]  Obama's actually now expanded the use
[09:32.760 --> 09:37.640]  Over and above what Cheney was engaged in so we'll we'll talk about that
[09:38.880 --> 09:44.480]  Also, we've written articles over the years at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[09:46.360 --> 09:48.880]  From Pentagon press releases and
[09:50.120 --> 09:54.680]  Leaked Pentagon documents, but but much of it is just completely public
[09:54.680 --> 09:58.800]  About the fact that every major city has
[09:59.920 --> 10:05.680]  A high-altitude blimp over it that can stay up for as much as a decade and
[10:06.360 --> 10:09.160]  It is powered off of solar energy
[10:09.800 --> 10:15.880]  And they have ground penetrating radar on them. They look right through your walls. It's like x-ray vision basically
[10:16.400 --> 10:18.400]  They have face scanning
[10:18.400 --> 10:24.480]  Cameras on them and everyone is being tracked in real time. I mean that's a Pentagon brags about that
[10:24.920 --> 10:26.920]  It's totally evil totally wicked
[10:27.880 --> 10:29.880]  But this is the slave grid
[10:30.640 --> 10:34.240]  They use blimps because they're much more inexpensive than satellites
[10:35.760 --> 10:40.800]  They can carry much larger payloads and satellites. They could stay up much longer and
[10:40.800 --> 10:48.840]  And this weekend there was another article on this and and then when I go on national radio shows they make fun of me and they say
[10:49.360 --> 10:54.800]  Are the blimps going to get us and I just say well if you go to info wars.com or prisonplanet.com
[10:54.800 --> 10:58.280]  Or you see my film martial law where we cover some of the blimps
[10:59.160 --> 11:04.100]  We just show you official government documents saying they're doing this and even
[11:04.480 --> 11:07.200]  Like the Army times and Air Force times and things like that
[11:07.200 --> 11:12.120]  But now since they're operational and over the entire country
[11:13.800 --> 11:20.160]  They're now declaring them classified again, and so Larry King live and then Fox News not just CNN
[11:20.960 --> 11:27.000]  I've actually done you know radio shows on this the last month when we simulcast at prisonplanet.tv
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.680]  So I can you know show the video they show it and say it's a giant flying saucer
[11:32.680 --> 11:40.720]  And all it is is a blimp with the Ford Finns on the back with the blisters of surveillance equipment and with the solar panels
[11:41.680 --> 11:46.000]  And then I'm the weirdo because I'm saying it's not aliens. It's blimps
[11:47.960 --> 11:54.160]  It's like asking a five-year-old what's that? Oh, it's a school bus and I go yeah, it's a school bus and the government says no
[11:54.160 --> 12:01.160]  It's a giant banana and then I'm the weirdo for saying it's a school bus and they're normal for saying a school bus is a banana
[12:01.160 --> 12:03.160]  See I'm the conspiracy theorist
[12:04.160 --> 12:09.160]  This is just one of thousands of things. It's very painful folks that I will list this right now
[12:10.160 --> 12:16.160]  And I will list this make this latest mainstream news article and people will just say nope doesn't exist. You're a liar
[12:17.160 --> 12:24.160]  And they will write mainstream news articles saying I'm insane. In fact, I googled my name last night and I found about 30 plus
[12:24.160 --> 12:29.160]  Mainstream news articles just suddenly attacking me and they say I'm insane. They're saying I'm insane
[12:29.160 --> 12:33.160]  And they say I'm insane. There's no North American Union. There's no New World Order
[12:34.160 --> 12:37.160]  Just well, I mean here's the LA Times, okay?
[12:38.160 --> 12:43.160]  Here it is right here. You can just Google this right now. It's it's a major paper. It's a city called Los Angeles
[12:43.160 --> 12:46.160]  It does exist. It's on the West Coast
[12:47.160 --> 12:51.160]  It was a Spanish mission before the United States got it. I assure you LA exists
[12:51.160 --> 12:55.160]  I assure you the LA Times exists. I assure you this article is real
[12:55.160 --> 12:59.160]  I know you're gonna say it doesn't exist because then you'd have to wake up to what's happening, but
[13:00.160 --> 13:02.160]  Nevertheless, I'm gonna try again
[13:03.160 --> 13:09.160]  Pentagon plans blimp to spy from new heights. The only reason this story is a bunch of bologna is these have been up for
[13:10.160 --> 13:14.160]  Experimentally for about 15 years and declassified government documents
[13:15.160 --> 13:17.160]  And for seven years all over the country
[13:17.160 --> 13:24.160]  Now again, this is the headline Pentagon plans blimp to spy from new heights reporting from Washington
[13:24.160 --> 13:27.160]  This is by Julia E. Barnes. I assure you she exists
[13:32.160 --> 13:36.160]  He exists Julia E. Barnes the Pentagon said Thursday that it intends to send
[13:37.160 --> 13:42.160]  400 million to develop a giant derogable that will float 65,000 feet
[13:42.160 --> 13:47.160]  It's actually 95,100 above the earth for 10 years providing unblinking and
[13:47.160 --> 13:52.160]  Intricate radar surveillance of the vehicles planes and even people below
[13:53.160 --> 13:58.160]  Now if you want to learn more about this just Google Homeland Security blimp, and you'll see MSNBC
[13:58.160 --> 14:04.160]  AP Reuters if you click news if you click web you'll see info wars.com present planet.com
[14:04.160 --> 14:10.160]  But then we have Senate testimony clips. I assure you there is a Senate into the District of Columbia
[14:10.160 --> 14:14.160]  There is a place called DC. I assure you there's a thing called C-Span
[14:14.160 --> 14:19.160]  I assure you there are these videos of Congress seven years ago admitting it's face-scanning you
[14:19.160 --> 14:24.160]  I will assure you Washington DC exists. I know it's radical
[14:25.160 --> 14:28.160]  But just Google Homeland Security blimps
[14:30.160 --> 14:34.160]  I'm not even being sarcastic guys. You know guys control them are laughing. I'm serious
[14:34.160 --> 14:38.160]  I mean if they told the public the planet didn't exist they believe it if they told them the sun was a light bulb
[14:38.160 --> 14:42.160]  They believe it because they want to feel like they're part of the establishment
[14:42.160 --> 14:44.160]  They love being robbed by the Madoffs that run America
[14:45.160 --> 14:48.160]  They'll say Madoff doesn't exist. Maybe that's a conspiracy
[14:50.160 --> 14:53.160]  It goes on it's absolutely revolutionary
[14:53.160 --> 14:57.160]  Chief scientist for the Air Force said the proposed unmanned airship. Oh really?
[14:57.160 --> 15:04.160]  Alexander Haig actually owned the company that sold the project 18 years ago to the Pentagon
[15:04.160 --> 15:10.160]  Just Google Alexander Haig proposes surveillance blimps
[15:12.160 --> 15:16.160]  General Alexander Haig. I know he doesn't exist either. I understand
[15:17.160 --> 15:20.160]  You know the thing is I'm informed so I'm weird
[15:21.160 --> 15:27.160]  See I'm not a thumb-sucking knuckle dragon cowardly stupid person going along with the New World Order
[15:27.160 --> 15:30.160]  That's what we predict and lay out everything as it happens years before
[15:30.160 --> 15:35.160]  But again it will that says attract you on the ground on the ground
[15:37.160 --> 15:39.160]  It's an absolutely revolutionary
[15:40.160 --> 15:43.160]  Werner AJ Dam
[15:43.160 --> 15:46.160]  Chief scientist for the Air Force said in a
[15:46.160 --> 15:52.160]  Of the proposed unmanned airship describing it as a cross between a satellite and a spy plane
[15:52.160 --> 15:54.160]  For you the slaves
[15:54.160 --> 16:02.160]  The 450 foot long craft would give the US military a better understanding of an adversary's movements habits and tactics official said
[16:02.160 --> 16:09.160]  And the ability to constantly monitor small movements in a wide area the Afghanistan border for example would dramatically improve military intelligence
[16:09.160 --> 16:12.160]  So they're just now introducing this to the slaves
[16:13.160 --> 16:15.160]  The issue here is
[16:15.160 --> 16:18.160]  Well, I'll tell you more about the blimps when we get back, but I've got all this other stuff
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.160]  I'll tell you about the Delta Force the federal government's hit squads who murder whoever they want whenever they want

[20:35.160 --> 20:37.160]  This is the GCN Radio Network
[20:37.160 --> 20:44.160]  Home to hard-hitting talk radio
[21:08.160 --> 21:14.160]  I'm not going to spend all day on this LA Times article
[21:14.160 --> 21:17.160]  Pentagon plans to build spy blimp from New Heights
[21:17.160 --> 21:22.160]  If you want to prove to yourself this article is a spin story, just google Homeland Security Blimps
[21:22.160 --> 21:27.160]  And you can pull up all the mainstream articles from 7 years ago, 10 years ago
[21:27.160 --> 21:34.160]  Even back before that where they're already in place over the United States tracking everything you do
[21:34.160 --> 21:37.160]  So I'm done talking about that
[21:37.160 --> 21:39.160]  Here's some of the other news I've got
[21:39.160 --> 21:47.160]  The Treaty of the Sea is, they've been trying to pass it for two decades
[21:47.160 --> 21:50.160]  It basically hands over control of the world's oceans to the United Nations
[21:50.160 --> 21:53.160]  And the private banks that use it as their governmental front
[21:53.160 --> 21:58.160]  And Fox News, of course, is telling us in this article how great it is
[21:58.160 --> 22:03.160]  Titled, Senate Moves Towards Ratification of the UN's Law of the Sea Treaty
[22:03.160 --> 22:05.160]  And it just goes on to break all that down
[22:05.160 --> 22:08.160]  Here's another one from Wired Magazine
[22:08.160 --> 22:10.160]  Now treaties are secret
[22:10.160 --> 22:17.160]  Obama Administration declares proposed IP Treaty, a national security secret
[22:17.160 --> 22:21.160]  President Barack Obama came into office in January, promising a new era of openness
[22:21.160 --> 22:24.160]  But now, like Bush before him, Obama is playing the National Security Card
[22:24.160 --> 22:30.160]  To hide details of the controversial anti-counterfeiting trade agreement being negotiated across the globe
[22:30.160 --> 22:34.160]  The White House this week declared, and there's a link to the PDF
[22:34.160 --> 22:40.160]  The text of the proposed treaty, a classified national security secret
[22:40.160 --> 22:45.160]  And rejecting a Freedom Information Act request by Knowledge Ecology International
[22:45.160 --> 22:49.160]  Please be advised, the document you seek are being withheld in full
[22:49.160 --> 22:57.160]  Wrote Cameron Brudini, Chief Foreer Officer of the White House Office of U.S. Trade Representatives
[22:57.160 --> 23:03.160]  If ratified, leaked documents posted on WikiLinks and other comments suggesting proposed trade accord
[23:03.160 --> 23:09.160]  Would criminalize peer-to-peer file sharing, period, period, no matter if it's legal
[23:09.160 --> 23:18.160]  Subjects iPods to broader searches and allows Internet service providers to monitor their customers' communications without warrants
[23:18.160 --> 23:22.160]  Just off the charts, that story right there
[23:22.160 --> 23:27.160]  Just legalizing the complete end of the Fourth Amendment through global government treaties
[23:27.160 --> 23:36.160]  Here's another one from CNN, Obama regime considering making veterans pay for treatment of service-related injuries with private insurers
[23:36.160 --> 23:39.160]  Yes, they're not going to treat the troops
[23:39.160 --> 23:45.160]  This is so sick, but they'll still confiscate our guns of order too anyways, I don't care
[23:45.160 --> 23:52.160]  Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki confirmed to diseases from CNN that the Obama administration is considering
[23:52.160 --> 23:58.160]  A controversial plan to make veterans pay for treatment of service-related injuries with private insurance
[23:58.160 --> 24:01.160]  Boy, that's really sick
[24:01.160 --> 24:07.160]  And they're saying they're setting that up for the 2010 Veterans Affairs Budget being debated now
[24:07.160 --> 24:12.160]  They vote for the budget eight, nine months before the New Year starts
[24:12.160 --> 24:16.160]  So I thought I'd cover that story for you
[24:16.160 --> 24:23.160]  Here's another one, Justice Department investigates Arizona sheriff for enforcing immigration law, CNS News
[24:23.160 --> 24:27.160]  Cyber News Service, yeah, we've interviewed him several times
[24:27.160 --> 24:31.160]  America County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, love him or hate him, he is enforcing immigration law
[24:31.160 --> 24:35.160]  And all over the country, I've interviewed scores of sheriffs and police chiefs
[24:35.160 --> 24:40.160]  Where they'll arrest illegal aliens for drunk driving or 10 people being in a van without seatbelts or whatever
[24:40.160 --> 24:43.160]  No ID, weapons, whatever
[24:43.160 --> 24:46.160]  And they just release them
[24:46.160 --> 24:49.160]  I'm sure you've all seen that in the newspaper how they release them
[24:49.160 --> 24:54.160]  But instead they're going after Arpaio, a former FBI agent in his own right
[24:54.160 --> 25:00.160]  The Justice Department has launched an investigation of the America County Sheriff's Office in Arizona
[25:00.160 --> 25:06.160]  Following a request by Congressional Democrats and allegations by liberal activists that the department has violated the civil rights of illegal aliens
[25:06.160 --> 25:10.160]  Representative John Conyers, who won't go after Bush for his crimes
[25:10.160 --> 25:14.160]  Gerald Nadler and others requested the investigation
[25:14.160 --> 25:18.160]  And it focuses on Sheriff Joe Arpaio and dozens of officers under his command
[25:18.160 --> 25:22.160]  Who are trained to the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agreements
[25:22.160 --> 25:26.160]  Of cooperation in communities to enhance safety and security
[25:26.160 --> 25:30.160]  Which partners with federal and local law enforcement to enforce immigration laws
[25:30.160 --> 25:37.160]  In a letter, March 10, 2009, Loretta Smith, Acting Assistant Attorney General, the Department of Justice, detailed what a department would be investigating
[25:37.160 --> 25:40.160]  And they just say they're going to go after him basically
[25:40.160 --> 25:42.160]  So you can read that if you want
[25:42.160 --> 25:47.160]  Here's another one, Department of Homeland Security, U.S. gun laws to fight Mexican drug cartels
[25:47.160 --> 25:51.160]  They want to ban most semi-automatic rifles, ban gun shows
[25:51.160 --> 25:55.160]  Further register American citizens just from the Associated Press
[25:55.160 --> 26:00.160]  Mexico has a total gun ban and they have one of the highest crime rates in the world
[26:00.160 --> 26:02.160]  I think the highest now as of last year
[26:02.160 --> 26:04.160]  That's right, it's the highest now
[26:04.160 --> 26:06.160]  State Department's reported
[26:06.160 --> 26:10.160]  And Chicago and New York have the highest crime rates in our country with total gun bans
[26:10.160 --> 26:16.160]  And actually, when you read their reports saying the majority of guns, they find cartels with them from the U.S.
[26:16.160 --> 26:19.160]  That's low-level gangbangers selling drugs here in the U.S.
[26:19.160 --> 26:25.160]  When you read the reports on Mexico from the State Department, they're buying them from the Mexican military and police
[26:25.160 --> 26:26.160]  They're fully auto
[26:26.160 --> 26:31.160]  In fact, in this AP article, they have the Attorney General Holder last week, Monday
[26:31.160 --> 26:39.160]  Badmouthing the Second Amendment, remember, he debated and filed a brief last year
[26:39.160 --> 26:44.160]  For a gun control group before he was even Attorney General, he was previously Deputy Attorney General under Clinton
[26:44.160 --> 26:48.160]  Calling for total gun ban in the D.C. gun ban case, so that's what he stands for and believes in
[26:48.160 --> 26:52.160]  But he said, yes, it's horrible, they have machine guns and hand grenades and rocket launchers
[26:52.160 --> 26:58.160]  Folks, you're not buying machine guns, hand grenades and rocket launchers at any store anywhere in the U.S.
[26:58.160 --> 27:00.160]  Okay, it's not true
[27:00.160 --> 27:04.160]  And they just know the public's ignorant
[27:04.160 --> 27:08.160]  Every day on the news, they show polar bears on floating ice and say they can't swim
[27:08.160 --> 27:12.160]  It's the best swimming mammal there is, they go out there to hunt seals
[27:12.160 --> 27:16.160]  But they know the public's uninformed, so they'll tell you they're drowning
[27:16.160 --> 27:20.160]  They'll say whatever, their population's actually exploded to record levels, but you know, so what?
[27:20.160 --> 27:24.160]  Back to the border, Homeland Security plans for violence on U.S. border
[27:24.160 --> 27:28.160]  This out of the Associated Press and talk about how the border's basically collapsing
[27:28.160 --> 27:31.160]  And Mexico's collapsing, their answer, disarm the American people
[27:31.160 --> 27:34.160]  You know, that's a wonderful idea, so that only the criminals will have guns
[27:34.160 --> 27:39.160]  Big story we broke four days ago at infowars.com
[27:39.160 --> 27:42.160]  Two different state police officers out of California and Missouri
[27:42.160 --> 27:46.160]  Sent me federally written threat integration fusion center documents
[27:46.160 --> 27:50.160]  Where they list Ron Paul, Libertarian Party, Bob Barr
[27:50.160 --> 27:54.160]  People that believe in North American Union as dangerous terrorists
[27:54.160 --> 27:58.160]  They said followers of Ron Paul want to kill police, but it says, you know, don't release these documents
[27:58.160 --> 28:00.160]  These are secret
[28:00.160 --> 28:04.160]  And then we put it out with the phone number to the state police offices where they issued these
[28:04.160 --> 28:06.160]  But it was federally written
[28:06.160 --> 28:09.160]  People didn't believe it, so we've since updated it with the names
[28:09.160 --> 28:11.160]  We called up the state police
[28:11.160 --> 28:15.160]  And we've got Captain Hull and Hultz and all of them
[28:15.160 --> 28:18.160]  There, you can call the phone number, you can talk to them
[28:18.160 --> 28:20.160]  It's real, it really happened
[28:20.160 --> 28:23.160]  This is really going on, this is how they're brainwashing police
[28:23.160 --> 28:27.160]  So, stop living in denial out there
[28:27.160 --> 28:30.160]  Meanwhile, Ron Paul, he really is a congressman
[28:30.160 --> 28:33.160]  Congressman really does exist, congress really does exist
[28:33.160 --> 28:37.160]  Madoff really does exist, 9.7 trillion stolen in the mail out
[28:37.160 --> 28:39.160]  Really does exist
[28:39.160 --> 28:42.160]  They're openly announcing a world government bank that will control everything we do
[28:42.160 --> 28:44.160]  That really does exist
[28:44.160 --> 28:48.160]  I really do exist, I mean, there really are threats to our liberty in history
[28:48.160 --> 28:52.160]  Ron Paul, culprits of financial collapse should be arrested
[28:52.160 --> 28:58.160]  Congressman Ron Paul says the people responsible for the economic crisis should not be
[28:58.160 --> 29:01.160]  Held as saviors and given more power to fix the problem they created
[29:01.160 --> 29:04.160]  But arrested and criminally prosecuted
[29:04.160 --> 29:09.160]  Paul told the Alex Jones show that the only way the private Federal Reserve could be brought under control
[29:09.160 --> 29:12.160]  Would be the result of a mass uprising
[29:12.160 --> 29:17.160]  Noting that there is a lot more awareness in Washington about the Fed's contribution to the economic crisis
[29:17.160 --> 29:22.160]  He's also introduced a bill to abolish the private Federal Reserve and audit the private Federal Reserve
[29:22.160 --> 29:25.160]  I was speaking on my show a few days ago, a weekday show
[29:25.160 --> 29:31.160]  Okay, we're going to come back, take your phone calls and get into a bunch of other even more important news
[29:31.160 --> 29:32.160]  Stay with us
[29:32.160 --> 29:36.160]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet
[29:36.160 --> 29:38.160]  With so many different methods of consumption
[29:38.160 --> 29:42.160]  How do you choose a simple yet effective way to get your daily intake?
[29:42.160 --> 29:46.160]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer
[29:46.160 --> 29:48.160]  Nature's Gem, premium omega-3
[29:48.160 --> 29:53.160]  Unlike other flax seed, our golden flax is grown on our farm in northern Minnesota
[29:53.160 --> 29:56.160]  Providing cooler temperatures and longer summer hours
[29:56.160 --> 30:00.160]  Producing the highest quality premium golden flax seed around

[34:15.160 --> 34:18.160]  Some of the other news I have here in front of me
[34:18.160 --> 34:22.160]  Governor Perry, who is about as conservative as Mao Zedong
[34:22.160 --> 34:26.160]  Rejects $555 million in federal stimulus money
[34:26.160 --> 34:32.160]  Now, $787 billion
[34:32.160 --> 34:35.160]  And I know that at least
[34:35.160 --> 34:39.160]  In the reports I saw, $60 billion of that was going to Texas
[34:39.160 --> 34:42.160]  They take our state money, they take it to Washington
[34:42.160 --> 34:44.160]  They send back a few pennies of it
[34:44.160 --> 34:45.160]  And then call it free federal money
[34:45.160 --> 34:47.160]  And I hear all these newscasts
[34:47.160 --> 34:49.160]  The feds are saying this is the only money we get
[34:49.160 --> 34:50.160]  And that we're bad
[34:50.160 --> 34:53.160]  But we're lucky they're there basically
[34:53.160 --> 34:54.160]  Meanwhile, it's our money
[34:54.160 --> 34:59.160]  And then Perry does this stunt
[34:59.160 --> 35:02.160]  He engages in this stunt
[35:02.160 --> 35:04.160]  Where he comes out and says
[35:04.160 --> 35:08.160]  I'm rejecting $555 million of it
[35:08.160 --> 35:10.160]  Because it's very unpopular
[35:10.160 --> 35:12.160]  So he's trying to look conservative
[35:12.160 --> 35:14.160]  From the center of a Houston hardware store
[35:14.160 --> 35:17.160]  Governor Perry ignited a debate about Texas job cuts
[35:17.160 --> 35:18.160]  Business taxes
[35:18.160 --> 35:20.160]  And President Barack Obama's so-called
[35:20.160 --> 35:22.160]  Economic stimulus program Thursday
[35:22.160 --> 35:24.160]  By rejecting the federal government's offer
[35:24.160 --> 35:30.160]  $555 million in aid to the unemployed
[35:30.160 --> 35:32.160]  The action now moves the legislature
[35:32.160 --> 35:34.160]  Which can bypass Perry and take the offer
[35:34.160 --> 35:36.160]  As long as it changes state laws
[35:36.160 --> 35:41.160]  And blocks Republican Perry's potential veto
[35:41.160 --> 35:45.160]  Democratic lawmakers said they will try that
[35:45.160 --> 35:47.160]  So he's taken billions of it
[35:47.160 --> 35:52.160]  But he's turning back $500 million of it
[35:52.160 --> 35:54.160]  And they've created two new income taxes
[35:54.160 --> 35:55.160]  On business owners
[35:55.160 --> 35:57.160]  They always say Texas doesn't have an income tax
[35:57.160 --> 35:59.160]  That made business flood here
[35:59.160 --> 36:01.160]  Well, we do have one now
[36:01.160 --> 36:04.160]  And I own a business, a small business
[36:04.160 --> 36:07.160]  That's my studio and TV studio
[36:07.160 --> 36:10.160]  And the film production studio we've got in South Austin
[36:10.160 --> 36:12.160]  I got like 20 employees now
[36:12.160 --> 36:16.160]  And just bureaucrats show up at your office
[36:16.160 --> 36:18.160]  And they demand to be let in
[36:18.160 --> 36:19.160]  Without warrants or anything
[36:19.160 --> 36:20.160]  We say no
[36:20.160 --> 36:23.160]  But then they just magically assess you
[36:23.160 --> 36:27.160]  And they just say, oh, this computer's worth $50,000
[36:27.160 --> 36:30.160]  It could be a literal $500 computer
[36:30.160 --> 36:33.160]  And we've got some of those little cheap e-machines
[36:33.160 --> 36:36.160]  And stuff, you know, just for basic stuff
[36:36.160 --> 36:40.160]  They go, no, that computer's worth $10,000
[36:40.160 --> 36:42.160]  And they just guesstimate
[36:42.160 --> 36:45.160]  And this has been going on for four years
[36:45.160 --> 36:47.160]  So this year we let them in
[36:47.160 --> 36:51.160]  And they said, oh, that couch's got to be worth $10,000
[36:51.160 --> 36:56.160]  This, you know, oh, this stack of videotapes
[36:56.160 --> 36:58.160]  What's that worth, $1,000?
[36:58.160 --> 37:01.160]  And so then you have to go prove and hold receipts
[37:01.160 --> 37:03.160]  And spend all your time bookkeeping
[37:03.160 --> 37:07.160]  Just to prove that your $1,000 computer
[37:07.160 --> 37:09.160]  Didn't cost $10,000
[37:09.160 --> 37:11.160]  And your $500 computer didn't cost $6,000
[37:11.160 --> 37:14.160]  Or God forbid, you actually have a $4,000, $5,000
[37:14.160 --> 37:17.160]  Editing computer for film, we've got quite a few of those
[37:17.160 --> 37:20.160]  Oh, that's got to be a $20,000 machine
[37:20.160 --> 37:24.160]  And then they want a percentage, just like Massachusetts
[37:24.160 --> 37:27.160]  Of everything in your office, it is a property tax
[37:27.160 --> 37:29.160]  A business property tax
[37:29.160 --> 37:31.160]  But now they have a business franchise tax
[37:31.160 --> 37:33.160]  It's really an income tax
[37:33.160 --> 37:35.160]  And they look at your gross
[37:35.160 --> 37:39.160]  And they do a calculation with what you keep
[37:39.160 --> 37:42.160]  And then you've got to give all your federal income tax stuff to them
[37:42.160 --> 37:45.160]  And it's just bureaucrats, bureaucrats
[37:45.160 --> 37:47.160]  It's disgusting
[37:47.160 --> 37:49.160]  Meanwhile, the businesses are shutting down
[37:49.160 --> 37:51.160]  And everything else is leaving the country
[37:51.160 --> 37:53.160]  And there's just more and more police and more and more bureaucrats
[37:53.160 --> 37:55.160]  And more and more checkpoints and more and more fines
[37:55.160 --> 37:57.160]  And fees and regulations
[37:57.160 --> 38:00.160]  It's just really disgusting to have this going on
[38:00.160 --> 38:06.160]  And they're talking about some type of new regional EMS tax
[38:06.160 --> 38:08.160]  Well, you're for saving people when they're hurt, aren't you?
[38:08.160 --> 38:09.160]  It has nothing to do with that
[38:09.160 --> 38:13.160]  We're for the lottery
[38:13.160 --> 38:14.160]  It'll be for education
[38:14.160 --> 38:16.160]  Oh, yeah
[38:16.160 --> 38:17.160]  And then a pittance goes towards that
[38:17.160 --> 38:20.160]  And then all the poor people go and dump their paycheck on every week
[38:20.160 --> 38:22.160]  I mean, it just goes on and on the scams
[38:22.160 --> 38:25.160]  We have a mafia government
[38:25.160 --> 38:28.160]  That engages in stunts like Perry
[38:28.160 --> 38:30.160]  You know, Ron Paul has said properly
[38:30.160 --> 38:33.160]  And he's right, he votes against the bills, the spending bills
[38:33.160 --> 38:35.160]  But then once the money's being served out
[38:35.160 --> 38:38.160]  He gets record amounts of money to South Texas
[38:38.160 --> 38:40.160]  What's the point?
[38:40.160 --> 38:41.160]  The money's going to go somewhere else
[38:41.160 --> 38:43.160]  He votes against the bill
[38:43.160 --> 38:45.160]  But then when the money is going to be served out anyways
[38:45.160 --> 38:48.160]  He actually tries to get it down to South Texas
[38:48.160 --> 38:50.160]  For shrimp and other fisheries
[38:50.160 --> 38:52.160]  To try to restock the ocean
[38:52.160 --> 38:54.160]  So we can have some business down there left for people
[38:54.160 --> 38:56.160]  And he put it out
[38:56.160 --> 38:57.160]  We need more earmarks
[38:57.160 --> 39:00.160]  An earmark just says what it's supposed to be spent on in the bill
[39:00.160 --> 39:02.160]  You know, you have the 9.7 trillion
[39:02.160 --> 39:03.160]  According to Bloomberg and AP
[39:03.160 --> 39:06.160]  Stolen so far by the offshore private banks
[39:06.160 --> 39:09.160]  Yeah, it's 9.7 trillion, not 700 billion
[39:09.160 --> 39:11.160]  I was watching Fox News today
[39:11.160 --> 39:13.160]  They were saying it was 2 billion
[39:13.160 --> 39:16.160]  That's Bloomberg's lawsuit from 4.5 months ago
[39:16.160 --> 39:18.160]  A few weeks into the bailout
[39:18.160 --> 39:19.160]  Where the federal government said
[39:19.160 --> 39:21.160]  We're not going to let you know how much money we've spent
[39:21.160 --> 39:22.160]  Of the 2 billion
[39:22.160 --> 39:23.160]  It's now 9.7
[39:23.160 --> 39:26.160]  But see, the media is still debating that 2 trillion number
[39:26.160 --> 39:28.160]  I was watching Fox right before we went on air
[39:28.160 --> 39:29.160]  They were having a special on it
[39:29.160 --> 39:30.160]  Some of you might have seen it
[39:30.160 --> 39:32.160]  And it was just more disinformation
[39:32.160 --> 39:34.160]  In the name of whistleblowing, they're whitewashing
[39:34.160 --> 39:36.160]  You understand how that works?
[39:36.160 --> 39:40.160]  So, it's bad
[39:40.160 --> 39:41.160]  It's real bad
[39:41.160 --> 39:42.160]  And Ron Paul wants earmarks
[39:42.160 --> 39:44.160]  He wants to know where that money's going
[39:44.160 --> 39:46.160]  But oh no, we can't have earmarks
[39:46.160 --> 39:50.160]  I mean, they train the public
[39:50.160 --> 39:53.160]  180 degrees from what reality is
[39:53.160 --> 39:55.160]  An earmark just means that it's listed
[39:55.160 --> 39:57.160]  Where it's going to be spent
[39:57.160 --> 39:59.160]  And is there a pork associated with that?
[39:59.160 --> 40:01.160]  You bet your butt
[40:01.160 --> 40:03.160]  But the media always talks about these, you know
[40:03.160 --> 40:05.160]  Pork braille projects of bridges
[40:05.160 --> 40:06.160]  Or wooden arrows
[40:06.160 --> 40:08.160]  Or sports stadiums
[40:08.160 --> 40:11.160]  Hey, that's fascism
[40:11.160 --> 40:12.160]  Because they give it to their cronies
[40:12.160 --> 40:13.160]  You know, the contracts
[40:13.160 --> 40:16.160]  And it's kind of socialism as far as the jobs go
[40:16.160 --> 40:18.160]  But it's a lot better than just
[40:18.160 --> 40:20.160]  Hey, here's 9.7 trillion to foreign banks
[40:20.160 --> 40:22.160]  And we don't know where it is
[40:22.160 --> 40:25.160]  So instead, they've got us debating all day
[40:25.160 --> 40:29.160]  The $787 million stimulus
[40:29.160 --> 40:32.160]  Instead of the $9.7 trillion banker hijacking
[40:32.160 --> 40:34.160]  That they call a bailout
[40:34.160 --> 40:36.160]  We knew this was going to come out
[40:36.160 --> 40:37.160]  I told you so
[40:37.160 --> 40:40.160]  It's now come out that the shooter in Alabama
[40:40.160 --> 40:42.160]  Was in some weird government training program
[40:42.160 --> 40:44.160]  With the military and the police as an auxiliary
[40:44.160 --> 40:46.160]  And was in psychiatric care
[40:46.160 --> 40:48.160]  Probably on medication
[40:48.160 --> 40:50.160]  And the AP reports the German shooter
[40:50.160 --> 40:52.160]  Was in psychiatric care
[40:52.160 --> 40:55.160]  And was on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor
[40:55.160 --> 40:56.160]  Of the Prozac class
[40:56.160 --> 40:57.160]  They won't say what drug
[40:57.160 --> 40:59.160]  Because I've never seen a case
[40:59.160 --> 41:01.160]  Where it doesn't come out where they aren't
[41:01.160 --> 41:04.160]  Chimpanzee that ripped the woman's jaw off
[41:04.160 --> 41:05.160]  And eyeballs out
[41:05.160 --> 41:07.160]  He was on a Prozac drug
[41:07.160 --> 41:10.160]  I forget which one, but this is the same thing
[41:10.160 --> 41:12.160]  It's like a McDonald's as a Burger King
[41:12.160 --> 41:14.160]  A Prozac as a Louvox
[41:14.160 --> 41:17.160]  In fact, let me get the exact drug
[41:17.160 --> 41:20.160]  Google chimpanzee was on drugs
[41:20.160 --> 41:22.160]  And then just shot in my ear with the name of it
[41:22.160 --> 41:23.160]  Because I can't remember
[41:23.160 --> 41:24.160]  I just want to give out the actual name
[41:24.160 --> 41:26.160]  Of the quote anti-depressant
[41:26.160 --> 41:28.160]  When it went on the inserts of those by law
[41:28.160 --> 41:30.160]  It admits it causes psychotic breaks
[41:30.160 --> 41:32.160]  Oh, gee, every shooter
[41:32.160 --> 41:34.160]  And every chimpanzee that murders people
[41:34.160 --> 41:36.160]  Is on these
[41:36.160 --> 41:38.160]  But everything's okay
[41:38.160 --> 41:39.160]  Let's just ban the guns
[41:39.160 --> 41:41.160]  Let's not have people running around
[41:41.160 --> 41:43.160]  On the Looney Pills
[41:43.160 --> 41:45.160]  Oh, yeah, they're real happy
[41:45.160 --> 41:47.160]  Till they have a bad trip
[41:47.160 --> 41:49.160]  Serotonin reuptake inhibitor
[41:49.160 --> 41:52.160]  Xanax, yeah, the chimpanzee was on Xanax
[41:52.160 --> 41:54.160]  Thank you, that's one of the really strong ones
[41:54.160 --> 41:55.160]  Even stronger than Prozac
[41:55.160 --> 41:56.160]  Okay, thank you
[41:56.160 --> 42:01.160]  I thought that, but I wanted to double-check
[42:01.160 --> 42:02.160]  What it goes on here
[42:02.160 --> 42:03.160]  The Associated Press confirms the story
[42:03.160 --> 42:06.160]  Widely published across the world
[42:06.160 --> 42:08.160]  Police investigator Siegfried Mahler
[42:08.160 --> 42:10.160]  States on the record that the shooter
[42:10.160 --> 42:12.160]  Underwent severe treatment sessions
[42:12.160 --> 42:14.160]  For depression in the psychiatric clinic
[42:14.160 --> 42:17.160]  And was prescribed a session of outpatient therapy
[42:17.160 --> 42:18.160]  Which he never began
[42:18.160 --> 42:21.160]  Thus, the shooter was a psychiatric medications
[42:21.160 --> 42:22.160]  And then quit using them
[42:22.160 --> 42:25.160]  This created a classic anti-depressant withdrawal crisis
[42:25.160 --> 42:28.160]  A key go-coo-coo for cocoa puffs
[42:28.160 --> 42:30.160]  And chop your children's arms off
[42:30.160 --> 42:31.160]  Every time you hear about that
[42:31.160 --> 42:32.160]  I've talked about this before
[42:32.160 --> 42:34.160]  I mean, every time you...
[42:34.160 --> 42:35.160]  Yeah, that was the Dallas case
[42:35.160 --> 42:37.160]  You were working at a news station at the time
[42:37.160 --> 42:39.160]  And remember, she was on that
[42:39.160 --> 42:40.160]  But they had another woman
[42:40.160 --> 42:42.160]  Chop her baby's arms off in Houston, she was on it
[42:42.160 --> 42:44.160]  And then the woman that drowned her kids was on it
[42:44.160 --> 42:45.160]  And the women that killed their kids
[42:45.160 --> 42:47.160]  It's all...they're always on it
[42:47.160 --> 42:51.160]  Because it's very rare to have people
[42:51.160 --> 42:53.160]  Or simians, for that matter
[42:53.160 --> 43:01.160]  Certainly somewhat similar to chimpanzees
[43:01.160 --> 43:02.160]  Don't do things like this
[43:02.160 --> 43:06.160]  Unless they're hopped up on hallucinogens
[43:06.160 --> 43:11.160]  But that's just some of the news and information
[43:11.160 --> 43:12.160]  I have her in front of me
[43:12.160 --> 43:13.160]  Okay, I promise we're going to
[43:13.160 --> 43:15.160]  Sean, Dan, Brian, Scott, Matt, many others
[43:15.160 --> 43:16.160]  As soon as we come back
[43:16.160 --> 43:17.160]  And then later in the next hour
[43:17.160 --> 43:20.160]  I'll tell you about my new film, the Obama Deception
[43:20.160 --> 43:22.160]  It's out right now at prisonplanet.tv
[43:22.160 --> 43:23.160]  In super high quality
[43:23.160 --> 43:24.160]  Or order the DVD
[43:24.160 --> 43:27.160]  Start shipping tomorrow at infowars.com
[43:27.160 --> 43:29.160]  This is the preeminent film
[43:29.160 --> 43:31.160]  Exposing Obama as a newer loader
[43:31.160 --> 43:32.160]  Frontman, stay with us
[43:32.160 --> 43:34.160]  Phase one of the Incentors Plan
[43:34.160 --> 43:35.160]  For a one-world government
[43:35.160 --> 43:37.160]  Has been initiated with the recent bailout
[43:37.160 --> 43:39.160]  International bankers and power brokers
[43:39.160 --> 43:41.160]  Have engineered the current crisis
[43:41.160 --> 43:43.160]  To create a new currency and a new world bank
[43:43.160 --> 43:44.160]  To act as savior
[43:44.160 --> 43:46.160]  But we've only seen the beginning
[43:46.160 --> 43:47.160]  Their next engineered crisis
[43:47.160 --> 43:49.160]  Will be on a scale never before seen
[43:49.160 --> 43:50.160]  In modern times
[43:50.160 --> 43:52.160]  Shortages and empty shelves
[43:52.160 --> 43:54.160]  Will spread fear and panic across the land
[43:54.160 --> 43:55.160]  The insiders have discovered
[43:55.160 --> 43:57.160]  That they must control two things
[43:57.160 --> 43:58.160]  To seize total power
[43:58.160 --> 44:01.160]  Phase one is a one-world currency
[44:01.160 --> 44:03.160]  Which we are currently being prepared to accept
[44:03.160 --> 44:05.160]  Phase two of their insidious plan
[44:05.160 --> 44:07.160]  Is complete control of our food supplies

[45:32.160 --> 45:34.160]  We know identity scams have grown
[45:34.160 --> 45:35.160]  In the past six months
[45:35.160 --> 45:37.160]  Because identity thieves are working overtime

[46:32.160 --> 46:35.160]  This year many of us will have to make the tough decision
[46:35.160 --> 46:37.160]  On what to cut back on
[46:37.160 --> 46:40.160]  And what's essential as we prepare for an uncertain future
[46:40.160 --> 46:42.160]  In these troubled times
[46:42.160 --> 46:44.160]  One of the most important things your family can have
[46:44.160 --> 46:45.160]  Is good health
[46:45.160 --> 46:47.160]  Some of the contributors to poor health
[46:47.160 --> 46:50.160]  Are parasites, viruses, toxins and heavy metals
[46:50.160 --> 46:51.160]  It's a documented fact
[46:51.160 --> 46:53.160]  80% of all Americans
[46:53.160 --> 46:55.160]  And 85% of people around the world
[46:55.160 --> 46:57.160]  Suffer from internal parasites
[46:57.160 --> 46:59.160]  And parasitic infection
[46:59.160 --> 47:01.160]  Now you can fight internal parasites
[47:01.160 --> 47:03.160]  Heavy metals and high cholesterol
[47:03.160 --> 47:04.160]  Naturally and safely
[47:04.160 --> 47:07.160]  By mixing fossilized phytoplankton powder
[47:07.160 --> 47:10.160]  Also known as FPP with your favorite beverage

[47:32.160 --> 47:37.160]  You're listening to GCN
[47:37.160 --> 48:03.160]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[48:07.160 --> 48:18.160]  That's right, take the Prozac
[48:18.160 --> 48:24.160]  Yes, put the whole population on drugs
[48:24.160 --> 48:26.160]  And cause people to go completely psychopathic
[48:26.160 --> 48:28.160]  And murder their families
[48:28.160 --> 48:31.160]  And then disarm the American people
[48:31.160 --> 48:37.160]  So they can't defend themselves
[48:37.160 --> 48:39.160]  Sanitarium
[48:39.160 --> 48:42.160]  Just leave me alone
[48:42.160 --> 48:44.160]  Just leave me alone
[48:58.160 --> 49:00.160]  You know, the new freedom initiative
[49:00.160 --> 49:02.160]  That Bush passed that Obama's expanding
[49:02.160 --> 49:04.160]  Brags in its own public documents
[49:04.160 --> 49:06.160]  Their plan is to put half
[49:06.160 --> 49:09.160]  Of American school children on psychotrophics
[49:09.160 --> 49:11.160]  And there'll be more suicides, more shootings
[49:11.160 --> 49:13.160]  It's a perfect plan
[49:13.160 --> 49:16.160]  That they'll come for our guns as they are now
[49:16.160 --> 49:18.160]  Let's go to Sean in Utah
[49:18.160 --> 49:21.160]  Sean, thanks for holding your on the year worldwide
[49:21.160 --> 49:23.160]  Alex, thanks for taking my call
[49:23.160 --> 49:24.160]  Good news from Utah
[49:24.160 --> 49:25.160]  We got a bill in the legislature
[49:25.160 --> 49:29.160]  To do away with the concealed and carry
[49:29.160 --> 49:33.160]  Bad news, the body scanning cameras
[49:33.160 --> 49:35.160]  Went up in the airport with no resistance
[49:35.160 --> 49:37.160]  Well, let me stop you there for a moment
[49:37.160 --> 49:39.160]  You're saying you want Vermont style concealed carry
[49:39.160 --> 49:41.160]  Where you don't have to get a license
[49:41.160 --> 49:42.160]  To have your second amendment
[49:42.160 --> 49:43.160]  Which turns a right into a privilege
[49:43.160 --> 49:45.160]  Is that what you're saying?
[49:45.160 --> 49:47.160]  Right, it's something to do with that
[49:47.160 --> 49:49.160]  It's similar, I was reading over the bill
[49:49.160 --> 49:50.160]  And then all over the country
[49:50.160 --> 49:52.160]  They're putting in body scanners
[49:52.160 --> 49:55.160]  That 360 biometrically scan your naked body
[49:55.160 --> 49:57.160]  Through your clothes and put it on a hard drive
[49:57.160 --> 49:59.160]  And now they train you to take your shoes off
[49:59.160 --> 50:01.160]  They train you not to have water or toothpaste
[50:01.160 --> 50:02.160]  To be a good slave
[50:02.160 --> 50:04.160]  They admit it's all part of basically dog training
[50:04.160 --> 50:05.160]  To train us to submit
[50:05.160 --> 50:08.160]  And now they're going to train us to have our body scanned
[50:08.160 --> 50:12.160]  Right, I was surprised that nobody spoke out on it
[50:12.160 --> 50:14.160]  Well, people did speak out
[50:14.160 --> 50:16.160]  The media just doesn't cover that
[50:16.160 --> 50:18.160]  Again, they only make maybe one out of ten people
[50:18.160 --> 50:19.160]  Go through it
[50:19.160 --> 50:21.160]  I'm not going through the thing
[50:21.160 --> 50:22.160]  And I'm sure they'll taser me
[50:22.160 --> 50:24.160]  And maybe murder me in one of the airports
[50:24.160 --> 50:27.160]  If I dare to not want to have my body scanned naked
[50:27.160 --> 50:29.160]  Or if I'm flying with my family
[50:29.160 --> 50:31.160]  If I dare to not want to put my wife and children through it
[50:31.160 --> 50:33.160]  So the perverts and the government can have that
[50:33.160 --> 50:34.160]  But I say pervert
[50:34.160 --> 50:36.160]  The real reason is that machine
[50:36.160 --> 50:38.160]  360 scans your whole body
[50:38.160 --> 50:40.160]  And then with the surveillance cameras
[50:40.160 --> 50:41.160]  And the rest of the system
[50:41.160 --> 50:42.160]  Even if you're wearing a mask
[50:42.160 --> 50:44.160]  It knows your body's signature
[50:44.160 --> 50:46.160]  And DARPA admits that's the
[50:46.160 --> 50:49.160]  Secret weapon Bob Woodward talked about in his book
[50:49.160 --> 50:51.160]  Late last year that they've deployed in Iraq
[50:51.160 --> 50:52.160]  It's body scanners
[50:52.160 --> 50:54.160]  Oh, wow
[50:54.160 --> 50:56.160]  Well, the Obama deception was great
[50:56.160 --> 50:58.160]  I saw with my prison plan TV membership
[50:58.160 --> 51:00.160]  And just want to commend you on that
[51:00.160 --> 51:02.160]  But the reason I called is
[51:02.160 --> 51:04.160]  Michael Wiener Savage
[51:04.160 --> 51:06.160]  On the 4th of March
[51:06.160 --> 51:08.160]  Said to his audience
[51:08.160 --> 51:10.160]  The first half hour or the first
[51:10.160 --> 51:12.160]  Hour of his show he said
[51:12.160 --> 51:15.160]  There will be a Reichstag-like event in this country
[51:15.160 --> 51:17.160]  No, that's good
[51:17.160 --> 51:19.160]  Savage is really coming a long way
[51:19.160 --> 51:21.160]  He came out and documented that
[51:21.160 --> 51:23.160]  Obama's policies are like the Nazis
[51:23.160 --> 51:25.160]  In government policy
[51:25.160 --> 51:27.160]  Which is true, but he didn't point out
[51:27.160 --> 51:29.160]  The Republicans helped set it all up
[51:29.160 --> 51:31.160]  And we did a story on that at
[51:31.160 --> 51:32.160]  MFullWars.com
[51:32.160 --> 51:34.160]  And I hope it comes all the way
[51:34.160 --> 51:36.160]  But I did get emails about that
[51:36.160 --> 51:37.160]  I didn't hear it
[51:37.160 --> 51:39.160]  He's talking about government-sponsored terrorism
[51:39.160 --> 51:41.160]  Well, good for him then, good
[51:41.160 --> 51:43.160]  Well, I was really surprised to hear it
[51:43.160 --> 51:45.160]  And I'm paraphrasing that he said
[51:45.160 --> 51:47.160]  A Reichstag-like event perpetrated by the government
[51:47.160 --> 51:49.160]  To justify a dictatorship
[51:49.160 --> 51:51.160]  So I thought that was pretty big news
[51:51.160 --> 51:52.160]  Well, that is big news
[51:52.160 --> 51:53.160]  Somebody find the clip and send it to me
[51:53.160 --> 51:55.160]  Well, I hail Savage then
[51:55.160 --> 51:57.160]  I appreciate the call
[51:57.160 --> 51:59.160]  All I wanted is these people to wake up
[51:59.160 --> 52:00.160]  And stand up
[52:00.160 --> 52:02.160]  I had Chuck Norris on for 35 minutes
[52:04.160 --> 52:06.160]  On Friday's show
[52:06.160 --> 52:08.160]  And Chuck Norris
[52:08.160 --> 52:09.160]  We first had him on last year
[52:09.160 --> 52:10.160]  And I found out
[52:10.160 --> 52:11.160]  I knew years ago
[52:11.160 --> 52:12.160]  And it had been one contact with him
[52:12.160 --> 52:14.160]  About a decade ago
[52:14.160 --> 52:16.160]  And I knew that he was a
[52:16.160 --> 52:17.160]  Listener of the show
[52:17.160 --> 52:19.160]  But last time I had him on
[52:19.160 --> 52:20.160]  About five months ago
[52:20.160 --> 52:22.160]  He said, no, I listen every week
[52:22.160 --> 52:23.160]  During a break when I was talking to him
[52:23.160 --> 52:25.160]  And then this week he kind of
[52:25.160 --> 52:26.160]  Said how great the show was
[52:26.160 --> 52:27.160]  And I was a crusader
[52:27.160 --> 52:29.160]  And he wants you to defeat the New World Order
[52:29.160 --> 52:31.160]  And arrest the New World Order bankers
[52:31.160 --> 52:34.160]  And it was blowing me away Friday
[52:34.160 --> 52:36.160]  In fact, that was a long interview
[52:36.160 --> 52:38.160]  That's why I didn't have you guys clip it out
[52:38.160 --> 52:40.160]  I forgot to tell you Friday
[52:40.160 --> 52:43.160]  But he said that a couple of times in the interview
[52:43.160 --> 52:45.160]  Just see if you can find it
[52:45.160 --> 52:47.160]  And I know it's posted up at infowars.com
[52:47.160 --> 52:48.160]  But there's just two of you
[52:48.160 --> 52:49.160]  And I don't know if we've got time
[52:49.160 --> 52:50.160]  In the end of the show
[52:50.160 --> 52:53.160]  To pull a clip of Chuck Norris on the show
[52:53.160 --> 52:54.160]  And that's a big deal
[52:54.160 --> 52:56.160]  Because the police love him
[52:56.160 --> 52:57.160]  For all he's done
[52:57.160 --> 52:59.160]  For law enforcement charities and stuff
[52:59.160 --> 53:02.160]  And all the movies glorify the police he's made
[53:02.160 --> 53:03.160]  And that's a big deal
[53:03.160 --> 53:04.160]  Having him come over against the New World Order
[53:04.160 --> 53:08.160]  We're very excited about having Chuck Norris on board
[53:08.160 --> 53:12.160]  And of course I also woke up
[53:12.160 --> 53:15.160]  A really big Hollywood star
[53:15.160 --> 53:16.160]  You do have the Savage clip?
[53:16.160 --> 53:19.160]  Really? How did you find it that fast?
[53:19.160 --> 53:21.160]  It's on YouTube?
[53:21.160 --> 53:29.160]  What's the name of the clip?
[53:29.160 --> 53:31.160]  And so you went on, it's called
[53:31.160 --> 53:34.160]  Michael Savage, New World Order, Agenda Exposed
[53:34.160 --> 53:36.160]  You know what? We'll post that up on infowars
[53:36.160 --> 53:38.160]  I'm not going to play his radio show here
[53:38.160 --> 53:40.160]  It's fair use but it gets into a grey area
[53:40.160 --> 53:43.840]  a gray area. I'm just not going to do it.
[53:43.840 --> 53:47.320]  Why don't you guys listen to it and write me just the quote about Reichstag.
[53:47.320 --> 53:48.360]  See if that's in there.
[53:48.360 --> 53:50.040]  Then I'll just.
[53:50.040 --> 53:53.080]  We play like 10 seconds of it, but I don't want to play a bunch of it.
[53:53.080 --> 53:56.640]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan.
[53:56.640 --> 53:59.680]  Dan, you're on the air from Alaska.
[53:59.680 --> 54:02.240]  Hey Alex, it's always a pleasure talking to you, my friend.
[54:02.240 --> 54:04.040]  Good to talk to you.
[54:04.040 --> 54:08.760]  The Obama deception was awesome, and I did do what I told you I was going to do.
[54:08.760 --> 54:10.320]  I made 50 copies of it.
[54:10.320 --> 54:13.120]  I'm passing it out to everybody I know.
[54:13.120 --> 54:14.880]  I also did what I told you I was going to do.
[54:14.880 --> 54:20.160]  I got a transmitter on the way to me so I can broadcast your voice to the local
[54:20.160 --> 54:21.560]  anchor sites up here.
[54:21.560 --> 54:24.680]  Yeah, for those that don't know, we have a sponsor up on infowars.com,
[54:24.680 --> 54:29.280]  but I had them on separate from being a sponsor that has a totally legal FCC
[54:29.280 --> 54:33.560]  approved certified AM transmitter that with the right antenna goes out three
[54:33.560 --> 54:34.560]  miles.
[54:34.560 --> 54:37.520]  And we're really, really excited that folks are putting those up everywhere on
[54:37.520 --> 54:40.960]  Dead Space, on the AM dial, and then streaming my show over the web or other
[54:40.960 --> 54:41.960]  shows.
[54:41.960 --> 54:42.960]  Absolutely.
[54:42.960 --> 54:47.280]  I'll tell you what, Alex, you have lit a fire inside of me.
[54:47.280 --> 54:52.440]  I did not know I had, and I want to thank you for that.
[54:52.440 --> 54:59.720]  Another thing I want to bring to your attention is if you Google states file
[54:59.720 --> 55:06.240]  sovereignty, the very first one that comes up is from Panamalaw.org.
[55:06.240 --> 55:11.320]  It was written on February 18th, but this is an actual law firm that has written
[55:11.320 --> 55:14.560]  a little article about the state's filing sovereignty.
[55:14.560 --> 55:19.760]  Now, in the article, they only tell you about 20 states, because at the time,
[55:19.760 --> 55:21.280]  that was the number.
[55:21.280 --> 55:27.640]  And as we all know, it's grown to 32, but it is well-written.
[55:27.640 --> 55:30.200]  You got to have your boys back there behind the scenes.
[55:30.200 --> 55:31.200]  Check that out real quick.
[55:31.200 --> 55:36.160]  I think even you would like it, but I just wanted to let you know.
[55:36.160 --> 55:37.160]  Thank you very much.
[55:37.160 --> 55:38.160]  Good to hear from you, Dan.
[55:38.160 --> 55:40.560]  Let's go now to Brian in Berkeley.
[55:40.560 --> 55:43.560]  I would guess that means Central California.
[55:43.560 --> 55:44.560]  Hello, Brian.
[55:44.560 --> 55:47.000]  Oh, well, hello, Alex.
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.880]  And thank you very much for your service to this country.
[55:49.880 --> 55:52.560]  The Founding Fathers do smile upon you.
[55:52.560 --> 55:58.840]  Anyway, I wanted to bring to the attention of your audience and to you yourself about
[55:58.840 --> 56:03.280]  the Oscar Gratcase, because you haven't really mentioned that too often.
[56:03.280 --> 56:09.640]  And I really fear that, I mean, of course, you know that the Marines, the Warrant Roots,
[56:09.640 --> 56:13.480]  and the Oakland Police Department have, you know, trained together, you know, you covered
[56:13.480 --> 56:19.680]  it in police states 1,000, about, you know, we're still having, you know, we're still
[56:19.680 --> 56:20.680]  in insurrection.
[56:20.680 --> 56:28.080]  Yeah, Oscar Grant did nothing, and the officers shot him in the back on the platform of the
[56:28.080 --> 56:30.680]  train there in the Bay Area.
[56:30.680 --> 56:34.560]  And then the cop started kind of slapping him around after he shot him in the back, flipped
[56:34.560 --> 56:37.960]  him over, kind of roughed him up, and then they tried to seize everybody's cameras and
[56:37.960 --> 56:41.120]  claim he'd attacked the police, which wasn't true.
[56:41.120 --> 56:45.480]  And thank God, people on a passing train, when it stopped, got good video of it to prove
[56:45.480 --> 56:46.480]  the murder.
[56:46.480 --> 56:49.800]  And it's, it's really a horrible case.
[56:49.800 --> 56:56.040]  Well, not only that, but there's been another video released with another police officer,
[56:56.040 --> 57:00.880]  Tony Peroni, the guy who pushed his knee on the neck of Oscar Grant, punching him in the
[57:00.880 --> 57:01.880]  face.
[57:01.880 --> 57:02.880]  And no investigation, nothing from good.
[57:02.880 --> 57:05.880]  Well, I mean, after you shoot somebody in the back, you got to beat him up a little.
[57:05.880 --> 57:10.680]  I mean, you know, how, I mean, that, that, that, that, that was an assault on an officer.
[57:10.680 --> 57:15.720]  So when the officer shoots you, you need to be charged with assaulting them.
[57:15.720 --> 57:16.720]  That's how this works.
[57:16.720 --> 57:17.720]  See,
[57:17.720 --> 57:23.200]  But just like how my friend, uh, David Santos, who, uh, put a horn to the crowd in January
[57:23.200 --> 57:28.000]  7th, where the riots happened and they charged him with 2,000 counts, this guy's 16 years
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.960]  old with inciting the riot and vandalism.
[57:30.960 --> 57:32.640]  And all he did was bowl on a crap.
[57:32.640 --> 57:35.880]  So you go on, use your free speech, you get charged with felonies.
[57:35.880 --> 57:41.720]  Well, that's because the bankers rule America and they've got to suppress the people.
[57:41.720 --> 57:45.240]  And they know that if we take the nation back, we're going to prosecute the bankers, as Ron
[57:45.240 --> 57:47.040]  Paul and others are calling for.
[57:47.040 --> 57:48.040]  And I appreciate your call.
[57:48.040 --> 57:52.240]  And yeah, since I've been calling for the arrest of the bankers and lawfully, I want
[57:52.240 --> 57:54.600]  the grand juries to indict them for the crimes they've committed.
[57:54.600 --> 57:57.440]  Congressman Ron Paul and others have agreed Chuck Norris agreed on the show Friday.
[57:57.440 --> 57:58.440]  I guess easy.
[57:58.440 --> 58:02.360]  Well now, uh, we're getting all sorts of dirty tricks against us.
[58:02.360 --> 58:06.480]  Again, the Obama deception is now available at prisonplanet.tv and super high quality
[58:06.480 --> 58:11.280]  downloaded burn at the desk, take as many copies as you want to give out to folks.
[58:11.280 --> 58:15.640]  And you can also order the super high quality DVD at infowars.com and support the filmmaker.
[58:15.640 --> 58:19.240]  We're going to come back with some quick comments on the film, some new developments there and
[58:19.240 --> 58:20.560]  your calls after the news.
[58:20.560 --> 58:21.560]  Stay with us.
[58:21.560 --> 58:26.920]  The IRS is skimming the wealth of the American people for the Wall Street bankers, taxpayers
[58:26.920 --> 58:30.600]  are being raked over the coals and forced to pay for bailout after bailout.
[58:30.600 --> 58:31.600]  First we went after the Fed.
[58:31.600 --> 58:33.680]  Now we're going after the internal revenue service.
[58:33.680 --> 58:38.960]  On April 15th, the Republic strikes back every zip code at every post office nationwide.

[58:46.840 --> 58:50.320]  Join us in this national grassroots action to end the federal income tax.
[58:50.320 --> 58:52.800]  On April 15th, the republic strikes back.
[58:52.800 --> 58:57.000]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[58:57.000 --> 59:01.240]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[59:01.240 --> 59:02.240]  to service debt.
[59:02.240 --> 59:05.760]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[59:05.760 --> 59:09.040]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[59:09.040 --> 59:13.360]  Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.

[1:00:30.720 --> 1:00:40.520]  And on News Radio 590 K.O.B.J. Austin, I R.N.U.S.A Radio News, I'm Jody Jordan.
[1:00:40.520 --> 1:00:44.400]  With interest rates sitting at a record low and the economy still reeling from the financial
[1:00:44.400 --> 1:00:49.640]  fallout, analysts aren't expecting any changes to come after the Federal Reserve policymakers
[1:00:49.640 --> 1:00:51.680]  meet this week.
[1:00:51.680 --> 1:00:55.720]  President Obama says the notion that the U.S. and Europe are taking sides with America
[1:00:55.720 --> 1:01:00.480]  pushing for more stimulus spending in Europe and nations favoring tighter regulation of
[1:01:00.480 --> 1:01:03.360]  the financial industry is a phony debate.
[1:01:03.360 --> 1:01:08.520]  In my mind at least, there is no conflict or contradiction between the positions of
[1:01:08.520 --> 1:01:11.560]  the G20 countries and how we're going to be moving forward.
[1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:14.000]  There's going to be differences in details.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:15.320]  Those are being worked out right now.
[1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:17.320]  I expect to have a productive meeting.
[1:01:17.320 --> 1:01:23.080]  And Christina Romer, one of President Barack Obama's top economic advisors, tells NBC that
[1:01:23.080 --> 1:01:30.000]  while the U.S. is temporarily in a financial mess, the economy is fundamentally sound.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:34.680]  This is IRN USA Radio News.
[1:01:34.680 --> 1:01:37.880]  Men and women, if you've got 10 to 30 pounds or more to lose, please listen carefully.
[1:01:37.880 --> 1:01:39.600]  Guys, many of us tend to overeat.
[1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:42.040]  We eat too much red meat, fast foods and processed foods.
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:44.600]  This keeps the belly flabby and keeps our bodies overweight.
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:48.080]  Ladies, have you ever said, I feel fat today, or do you have this bloated feeling?
[1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:51.360]  And how many of you have been trying to lose the same 10 to 20 pounds for years?
[1:01:51.360 --> 1:01:54.320]  There's a healthy and faster way to lose weight than any diet pill.
[1:01:54.320 --> 1:01:57.760]  It's called Evercleans, a clinically proven weight loss and detox formula that helps you
[1:01:57.760 --> 1:02:01.880]  lose weight and get rid of the 5 to 25 pounds of waste that some experts say is trapped
[1:02:01.880 --> 1:02:04.000]  to the colon walls like spackle or paste.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.360]  Two weeks of Evercleans may be equal to months of dieting.
[1:02:06.360 --> 1:02:07.360]  It's simple too.
[1:02:07.360 --> 1:02:09.960]  There are several tasteless crystals that dissolve in any food or beverage.
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:12.880]  Evercleans will flatten out your midsection, reduce love handles, and bellies and bloating
[1:02:12.880 --> 1:02:14.600]  have been disappearing in just days.
[1:02:14.600 --> 1:02:18.120]  You see, Evercleans gets rid of the weight you can't take off by exercising or starving
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:19.120]  yourself on a diet.
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:21.320]  And it's not something you have to take for the rest of your life.
[1:02:21.320 --> 1:02:23.200]  Call now to receive a very special offer.
[1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:26.080]  Call 800-567-5598.

[1:02:29.880 --> 1:02:34.200]  That's 800-567-5598.
[1:02:34.200 --> 1:02:38.840]  The president's chief economic advisor says the bonus payment is given out to an American
[1:02:38.840 --> 1:02:41.320]  international group or outrageous.
[1:02:41.320 --> 1:02:45.920]  This whole area is something we're going to have to look at as we think about regulation
[1:02:45.920 --> 1:02:51.640]  in the future because no one can be satisfied with what's happened.
[1:02:51.640 --> 1:02:57.720]  Lawrence Summers told ABC that the troubled insurance giant got more than 170 billion
[1:02:57.720 --> 1:02:59.480]  in bailout money.
[1:02:59.480 --> 1:03:04.160]  And the weather is looking good for tonight's rescheduled launch of the space shuttle Discovery.
[1:03:04.160 --> 1:03:09.440]  Repairs have been made after a hydrogen gas leak scrapped liftoff plans Wednesday.
[1:03:09.440 --> 1:03:14.400]  The delay is short in the mission by at least a day, increasing pressure for today's departure.
[1:03:14.400 --> 1:03:16.040]  This is NASA's George Stiller.
[1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:21.760]  Right now we are well past the point where our leakage problem developed on our first
[1:03:21.760 --> 1:03:27.720]  launch attempt, and we are not seeing any indications of leakage at all.
[1:03:27.720 --> 1:03:57.160]  For the latest news and analysis, log on to IRNUSANews.com.
[1:03:57.720 --> 1:04:11.200]  Sounds from Sunday services that resumed today at an Illinois church, one week after
[1:04:11.200 --> 1:04:13.640]  the senior pastor was gunned down.
[1:04:13.640 --> 1:04:18.520]  A minister from Texas talked to the congregation and spoke from his own experience.
[1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:23.640]  A decade ago, a gunman entered his Fort Worth church and killed seven people before committing
[1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:24.640]  suicide.
[1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:30.120]  OPEC oil ministers say they'll continue current output levels, but try to end over production
[1:04:30.120 --> 1:04:32.280]  by some cartel members.
[1:04:32.280 --> 1:04:36.600]  Today's decision means there'll be no cutbacks from December production levels.
[1:04:36.600 --> 1:04:40.200]  Abdullah Saleem al-Badri is the OPEC secretary general.
[1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:45.080]  Taking into consideration what's going on in the world economy, everything we try to
[1:04:45.080 --> 1:04:50.960]  talk about, everything is negative, you know, every day we receive negative information,
[1:04:50.960 --> 1:04:54.280]  so we just try to balance the situation out.
[1:04:54.280 --> 1:04:59.920]  In Israel is setting a deadline for a prisoner exchange with the Hamas rulers of Gaza.
[1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:00.920]  Here's Mark Levine.
[1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:05.920]  The clock is ticking down on a deal for release of an Israeli soldier held nearly three years
[1:05:05.920 --> 1:05:08.520]  by Hamas-linked militants in Gaza.
[1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:10.520]  Israel has set a special cabinet meeting for tomorrow.
[1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:14.960]  If there's no deal today, the prisoner issue will be turned over to the next government.
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:19.200]  The current government appears willing to free most of the prisoners Hamas is demanding,
[1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:21.080]  including convicted terrorists.
[1:05:21.080 --> 1:05:25.640]  The Benjamin Netanyahu, the incoming Israeli prime minister, takes a harder line against
[1:05:25.640 --> 1:05:27.880]  Hamas and Arabs in general.
[1:05:27.880 --> 1:05:28.880]  Mark Levine Jerusalem.
[1:05:28.880 --> 1:05:32.840]  And I'm Jody Jordan, frying our end USA radio news.

[1:07:01.760 --> 1:07:11.840]  We've got a big second hour, final hour lined up for you.
[1:07:11.840 --> 1:07:12.840]  Lots of your calls.
[1:07:12.840 --> 1:07:16.320]  Let me hit some of the news that's coming up that we'll go right back to your calls.
[1:07:16.320 --> 1:07:19.960]  I was digging through a bunch of stuff we got out of storage.
[1:07:19.960 --> 1:07:23.320]  It's always had too small of an office so I had a bunch of storage buildings.
[1:07:23.320 --> 1:07:27.040]  We were moving some of them to the office and I was looking at some of the first tapes
[1:07:27.040 --> 1:07:30.880]  of myself when I started out on Access TV and I saw the dates on them.
[1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:36.240]  So it's now been 14 years, I hadn't really thought about it, 14 years I've been on air
[1:07:36.240 --> 1:07:39.280]  looking at those dates, 14 plus years.
[1:07:39.280 --> 1:07:43.680]  And you know, everything I've always covered has been government documents.
[1:07:43.680 --> 1:07:51.440]  I found out in 1997 that Delta Force in Houston and other areas of South Texas and North Texas
[1:07:51.440 --> 1:07:56.760]  and all over the country was buying off city councils, mayors, police chiefs and paying
[1:07:56.760 --> 1:08:02.640]  them big briefcases and suitcases and some cases as much as $500,000, you know, per mayor
[1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:03.640]  and city official.
[1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:04.920]  And I was like, what is that about?
[1:08:04.920 --> 1:08:09.160]  I even saw it in the Associated Press and I'd go on the air and say, you know, a super
[1:08:09.160 --> 1:08:15.680]  secret military team under the control of the president, Bill Clinton at the time, is
[1:08:15.680 --> 1:08:16.680]  paying people off.
[1:08:16.680 --> 1:08:21.080]  So I went and interviewed Thomas Sanchez, emergency management, Kingsville and Chief
[1:08:21.080 --> 1:08:24.400]  of Police, San Antonio, LA, Philippus, I mean, I got in the car and drove down and interviewed
[1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:28.480]  him, put him on a local TV show and then on the radio show and people would call in and
[1:08:28.480 --> 1:08:30.040]  say, you've made this up.
[1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:31.760]  The military is not sneaking around, paying people off.
[1:08:31.760 --> 1:08:34.600]  And I'd say, well, here's the Associated Press, here's the interview and let me play
[1:08:34.600 --> 1:08:35.600]  the audio of the police chief.
[1:08:35.600 --> 1:08:38.720]  They'd say, oh, it's not real.
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:42.480]  And now the Newarker magazine has broken a bunch of news concerning this.
[1:08:42.480 --> 1:08:46.000]  I want to go over that after we take some calls.
[1:08:46.000 --> 1:08:51.040]  But on every issue I cover, most of it is in government documents or legislation or even
[1:08:51.040 --> 1:08:52.040]  mainstream news.
[1:08:52.040 --> 1:08:53.440]  It just doesn't get any attention.
[1:08:53.440 --> 1:08:56.440]  We try to give it attention and connect the dots.
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:09:04.480]  Now in my film Terror Storm, a history government sponsored terror put out in 2007, I go over
[1:09:04.480 --> 1:09:10.600]  many of the 200 plus declassified instances where the US government admits, I mean, this
[1:09:10.600 --> 1:09:14.560]  is congressional testimony, they admit it, that they blow up buildings, blow up school
[1:09:14.560 --> 1:09:20.280]  buses all over the world, things that will upset people to blame it on their enemies.
[1:09:20.280 --> 1:09:24.800]  And then last year, WikiLinks came out and mainstream news reported on it, an army field
[1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:29.720]  manual we've read on air where they teach army captains in black ops, in black operations,
[1:09:29.720 --> 1:09:31.360]  secret operations.
[1:09:31.360 --> 1:09:37.200]  One of their main tools is staged terror, false flag, and they teach them how to do that.
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:41.240]  A good Hollywood example of this, based on kind of a composite of some true stories,
[1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:47.520]  but it's based on true stories, but a fiction, The Quiet American by Graham Greene, where
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:52.880]  the CIA guy is, you have a CIA in Southern Vietnam is staging terror attacks to blame
[1:09:52.880 --> 1:09:55.480]  it on the communist.
[1:09:55.480 --> 1:10:00.520]  And the Pentagon's argument is, well, you know, the Russians, they stage terror attacks
[1:10:00.520 --> 1:10:02.360]  and blame it on us, so we've got to do it too.
[1:10:02.360 --> 1:10:07.720]  And then that's how you become totally evil by saying, oh, I'll become my enemy to fight
[1:10:07.720 --> 1:10:09.440]  them.
[1:10:09.440 --> 1:10:12.320]  And so when I talk about this, I'm only covering what's admitted.
[1:10:12.320 --> 1:10:14.880]  I mean, do you understand that?
[1:10:14.880 --> 1:10:19.920]  Do you understand there's Operation Northwoods to bomb US ships, bomb DC, hijack jets by
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:24.520]  remote control, commit sniper attacks all over the country and blame it on the Russians?
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:28.520]  ABC News, Baltimore Sun, just Google, Operation Northwoods.
[1:10:28.520 --> 1:10:32.160]  I mean, all I'm covering is real stuff.
[1:10:32.160 --> 1:10:36.000]  Now I did go on the air two months before 9-11, and I said they're going to stage terror
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:38.800]  attacks probably on the World Trade Center.
[1:10:38.800 --> 1:10:44.120]  You can just Google Alex Jones predicts 9-11, you can hear the radio show and the TV show,
[1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:45.800]  you can watch it.
[1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:49.400]  There's millions of views on the web of it on Google and YouTube and everywhere else.
[1:10:49.400 --> 1:10:54.000]  There's a new film out, The Selection of South by Southwest, the documentary film of the year
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:57.600]  by the Independent Film Channel called New World Order, and they have the clips of me
[1:10:57.600 --> 1:11:01.760]  and they're talking about that.
[1:11:01.760 --> 1:11:05.560]  Well I went on air a couple months ago and I said Obama's agenda is going to stall, even
[1:11:05.560 --> 1:11:08.280]  before he was sworn in, but when he was elected.
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:11.120]  And I said people are going to find out this guy's a globalist, and I'm going to tell you
[1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:14.560]  right now the way they're setting up the military to police America, the way this has all been
[1:11:14.560 --> 1:11:18.720]  geared up under the last four or five administrations, it's all coming to a head.
[1:11:18.720 --> 1:11:21.920]  They're going to make their move now, they're going to stage a huge Reichstag event to bring
[1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:22.920]  in martial law.
[1:11:22.920 --> 1:11:27.120]  And I have police sending me secret state police documents, the feds make for them,
[1:11:27.120 --> 1:11:28.120]  and we've covered that.
[1:11:28.120 --> 1:11:29.840]  I mean, they're really getting ready.
[1:11:29.840 --> 1:11:33.360]  I have to give credit where credit's due, because I've really criticized this guy a lot, and
[1:11:33.360 --> 1:11:38.320]  I'm still listening during the break to the larger clip, you know, he's claiming that
[1:11:38.320 --> 1:11:41.560]  Obama, you know, works for the Muslims or something is going to get us and going to
[1:11:41.560 --> 1:11:45.200]  fool Rahm Emanuel and all these people and that he's going to set up a dictatorship.
[1:11:45.200 --> 1:11:47.800]  So so he'll admit the new world order, but claim the Muslims around it.
[1:11:47.800 --> 1:11:51.320]  If you believe that you need your head fixed, you have to believe the military is run by
[1:11:51.320 --> 1:11:52.320]  the Muslims.
[1:11:52.320 --> 1:11:53.720]  But this is a big deal.
[1:11:53.720 --> 1:11:56.800]  I think the fourth biggest radio host in the country says something like this, and we're
[1:11:56.800 --> 1:11:58.680]  going to play the whole clip or just play a short clip.
[1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:02.720]  If you want to see it, you can just Google new world order agenda expose, listen carefully
[1:12:02.720 --> 1:12:06.960]  on YouTube and you can hear him say this, but here's just a quick clip of it.
[1:12:06.960 --> 1:12:08.440]  I mean, is he turning into Alex Jones?
[1:12:08.440 --> 1:12:09.440]  Here it is.
[1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:12.280]  I made a prediction on this show yesterday that I'll repeat right now so that you can
[1:12:12.280 --> 1:12:13.280]  mark it down.
[1:12:13.280 --> 1:12:21.960]  Savage predicts a rice dog fire like event sometime within the next year or two in America
[1:12:21.960 --> 1:12:26.560]  that will have been conducted by the government and blamed upon subversive elements in order
[1:12:26.560 --> 1:12:31.440]  to permit a dictatorship and a naked dictatorship to emerge in this country.
[1:12:31.440 --> 1:12:32.440]  All right.
[1:12:32.440 --> 1:12:33.440]  Okay.
[1:12:33.440 --> 1:12:34.440]  There you go.
[1:12:34.440 --> 1:12:35.440]  You can watch the rest of the clip.
[1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:38.680]  You can watch it on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com as soon as possible.
[1:12:38.680 --> 1:12:40.560]  In fact, guys, here's my iPhone.
[1:12:40.560 --> 1:12:41.920]  It's got Kurt Nemo's number in it.
[1:12:41.920 --> 1:12:42.920]  You know how to get it?
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:43.920]  Get that.
[1:12:43.920 --> 1:12:44.920]  I want you to call him right now and please ask him to post this.
[1:12:44.920 --> 1:12:46.520]  I think Watson's over in England.
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:47.520]  He probably went to bed.
[1:12:47.520 --> 1:12:50.840]  I've been keeping him up all weekend anyways with Obama promotion stuff.
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:51.840]  Here you go.
[1:12:51.840 --> 1:12:52.840]  I just turned it on for you.
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:53.960]  I'll take a minute to boot up.
[1:12:53.960 --> 1:12:57.880]  Look, this isn't a game or a joke.
[1:12:57.880 --> 1:12:59.240]  It's not Patty cake time.
[1:12:59.240 --> 1:13:01.360]  It's not fun to be Alex Jones.
[1:13:01.360 --> 1:13:03.520]  It's not fun to know this stuff.
[1:13:03.520 --> 1:13:07.320]  It is very, very serious and I have a lot of sleepless nights.
[1:13:07.320 --> 1:13:12.560]  That's how I can work 18 hours a day because I know my family, my children, none of us,
[1:13:12.560 --> 1:13:16.880]  you and the author listening, have any future if we don't stop this.
[1:13:16.880 --> 1:13:21.200]  I told you they would stage terror attacks blaming on Muslims and then set up a police
[1:13:21.200 --> 1:13:24.320]  state which they would then swing around against the American people.
[1:13:24.320 --> 1:13:28.840]  They're now teaching every police departments in the news that the American people are going
[1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:33.120]  to attack them and that Homeland Security isn't for Al Qaeda and that Northcom is to
[1:13:33.120 --> 1:13:36.720]  fight the American people and the Army War Colleges said it and the Army has announced
[1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:37.720]  it.
[1:13:37.720 --> 1:13:39.240]  It is official.
[1:13:39.240 --> 1:13:40.240]  Okay?
[1:13:40.240 --> 1:13:43.720]  Now, I'm sorry if you don't want to believe that.
[1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:45.200]  The facts are the facts.
[1:13:45.200 --> 1:13:49.840]  We're not five-year-olds where we can imagine whatever we want to be true and then that's
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:52.960]  supposedly true.
[1:13:52.960 --> 1:13:55.640]  The only way to turn this around is if you get educated out there.
[1:13:55.640 --> 1:13:59.560]  I'm talking to those that have laughed at me over the years.
[1:13:59.560 --> 1:14:04.600]  Here's this article by Paul Watson up on PrisonPlanet.com he wrote yesterday in conjunction
[1:14:04.600 --> 1:14:09.680]  with myself, Cheney assassination unit still active under Obama, including domestically.
[1:14:09.680 --> 1:14:15.480]  See, Psy Hirsch through the left-right paradigm, he'll report on everything Bush did and then
[1:14:15.480 --> 1:14:18.280]  act like it's just Bush and now we're okay because Obama's here.
[1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:21.680]  Well, you understand they're working together behind the scenes and that they're just front
[1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:22.680]  men.
[1:14:22.680 --> 1:14:27.280]  You understand how deadly dangerous all of this is because these assassination teams
[1:14:27.280 --> 1:14:29.840]  are being used in the U.S.
[1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:32.920]  The military covertly is running every major city.
[1:14:32.920 --> 1:14:35.400]  This week I saw a bunch of mainstream news articles we covered on the show.
[1:14:35.400 --> 1:14:40.520]  We posted them on the site, linked to them, where they're announcing, oh, the Army's
[1:14:40.520 --> 1:14:45.720]  putting officers, military, regular Army in all major police departments as liaison officers.
[1:14:45.720 --> 1:14:47.520]  Oh, the Marines are out at DWI checkpoints.
[1:14:47.520 --> 1:14:51.240]  Oh, at the shooting in Alabama, regular Army went out on the streets and I had the Army
[1:14:51.240 --> 1:14:53.480]  Colonel on admitting it.
[1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:57.040]  Total violation of Posse commentators.
[1:14:57.040 --> 1:15:00.040]  So it's all there on record.
[1:15:00.040 --> 1:15:04.360]  Chaining assassination units still active under Obama, including domestically, but they keep
[1:15:04.360 --> 1:15:07.560]  doing this left-right bait and switch so folks think of the President's running something
[1:15:07.560 --> 1:15:11.440]  instead of the real power behind the throne, the bankers who need to be arrested.
[1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:15.400]  But they have to have a police state and martial law so that you can never bring them to justice.
[1:15:15.400 --> 1:15:16.880]  That's the whole point.
[1:15:16.880 --> 1:15:21.160]  Criminals want tyranny so they can get away with their crimes and they use people in the
[1:15:21.160 --> 1:15:23.640]  military to carry it out in every case.
[1:15:23.640 --> 1:15:27.720]  Citizens of the political assassination unit, which reported solely to Dick Cheney was an
[1:15:27.720 --> 1:15:32.400]  operation during the Bush administration, are absent the fact that the unit in question,
[1:15:32.400 --> 1:15:36.840]  the Joint Special Operations Command, has been active for decades, has been deployed
[1:15:36.840 --> 1:15:40.560]  domestically in the United States, and we have links to mainstream news on that, has
[1:15:40.560 --> 1:15:46.120]  killed U.S. citizens and is an integral part of Barack Obama's expanded wars in Afghanistan
[1:15:46.120 --> 1:15:48.640]  and Pakistan.
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:52.080]  Seymour Hearst dropped a bombshell when he told the University of Minnesota audience
[1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:59.360]  on Tuesday that Joint Special Operations Command is an executive assassination ring, essentially,
[1:15:59.360 --> 1:16:02.720]  and has been going on and on and on, Hearst stated.
[1:16:02.720 --> 1:16:07.040]  Under President Bush's authority, they've been going into countries not talking to the
[1:16:07.040 --> 1:16:13.120]  ambassador or the CIA station chief and finding people on a list and executing them and leaving.
[1:16:13.120 --> 1:16:16.400]  That's been going on in the name of Assault and anyone on to admit they're also operating
[1:16:16.400 --> 1:16:17.400]  in the U.S.
[1:16:17.400 --> 1:16:20.920]  All right, I'll finish up with this and then go directly to your calls on the other side
[1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:25.640]  of this quick break, but they'll expose the Republicans now that they're out of power,
[1:16:25.640 --> 1:16:28.560]  not expose the fact that Obama is actually accelerating all this.
[1:16:28.560 --> 1:16:29.560]  Stay with us.
[1:16:29.560 --> 1:16:36.720]  Hello, this is Peter Crunch, a novel from Midos Resources, and I'd like to share some
[1:16:36.720 --> 1:16:37.720]  thoughts with you.
[1:16:37.720 --> 1:16:42.280]  In today's economy, with the government spending gone wild, the banking system on the verge
[1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:47.080]  of collapse, and Wall Street and continuous freefall, we both know that it's critical
[1:16:47.080 --> 1:16:50.120]  that you protect your savings and retirement programs now.
[1:16:50.120 --> 1:16:54.320]  Macroeconomics can be very confusing, but the solution to securing your personal assets
[1:16:54.320 --> 1:16:55.760]  is very simple.
[1:16:55.760 --> 1:16:57.800]  It's purchase of gold and silver.
[1:16:57.800 --> 1:17:01.440]  These precious metals have been the trusted means of exchange for centuries, and they've
[1:17:01.440 --> 1:17:04.480]  never been more important in our country's history.
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:08.800]  It's up to you to design your survival plan, one based on gold and silver.
[1:17:08.800 --> 1:17:09.800]  Give me a call.
[1:17:09.800 --> 1:17:16.800]  I'm Peter Crunch, novel at 800-686-2237, extension 108, and allow me to outline an easy answer
[1:17:16.800 --> 1:17:18.360]  to your questions.
[1:17:18.360 --> 1:17:24.120]  I'm Peter Crunch, novel at 1800-686-2237, extension 108.
[1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:32.440]  Call Peter at 1800-686-2237, extension 108, while you can still purchase gold with paper.
[1:17:32.440 --> 1:17:36.720]  We know identity scams have grown in the past six months because identity thieves are working
[1:17:36.720 --> 1:17:39.960]  overtime taking advantage of this economic crisis.
[1:17:39.960 --> 1:17:41.960]  I'm Todd Davis, CEO of LifeLock.
[1:17:41.960 --> 1:17:46.560]  I talk to people every day about identity theft, and I know a lot of you are scared
[1:17:46.560 --> 1:17:47.560]  and nervous.
[1:17:47.560 --> 1:17:49.740]  I'm here to tell you you don't have to be.
[1:17:49.740 --> 1:17:54.000]  Another identity is stolen every three seconds, but you can have the security and peace of
[1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:58.280]  mind that comes with being protected by LifeLock for just pennies a day.
[1:17:58.280 --> 1:18:02.400]  LifeLock is number one in identity theft protection because we work to stop identity
[1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:07.600]  theft before it happens, or we fix it at our expense up to $1 million.
[1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:09.640]  Don't spend another minute worrying.
[1:18:09.640 --> 1:18:10.960]  Call LifeLock now.
[1:18:10.960 --> 1:18:15.400]  Get instant protection by calling 1-800-605-4229.

[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:33.680]  Again, 1-800-605-4229.
[1:18:33.680 --> 1:18:37.440]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[1:18:37.440 --> 1:18:39.720]  problems facing the U.S. and the world.
[1:18:39.720 --> 1:18:43.680]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[1:18:43.680 --> 1:18:48.160]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated
[1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:50.160]  foods for almost 40 years.
[1:18:50.160 --> 1:18:52.120]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[1:18:52.120 --> 1:18:56.240]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:19:00.400]  from start to finish with doubly-nammeled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[1:19:00.400 --> 1:19:04.480]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale
[1:19:04.480 --> 1:19:05.480]  prices.
[1:19:05.480 --> 1:19:08.840]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve
[1:19:08.840 --> 1:19:10.920]  ships within five business days.
[1:19:10.920 --> 1:19:13.040]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:16.640]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you free of charge.
[1:19:16.640 --> 1:19:25.440]  Dial 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit our website at readyreservefoods.com.

[1:19:28.480 --> 1:19:31.920]  Call us at 1-800-453-2202.
[1:19:31.920 --> 1:19:33.760]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:35.560]  What does humidity mean to you?
[1:19:35.560 --> 1:19:38.200]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days.
[1:19:38.200 --> 1:19:42.080]  But many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure
[1:19:42.080 --> 1:19:43.080]  drinking water.
[1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:46.280]  That's why I'd like you to visit AkolaBlue.com.
[1:19:46.280 --> 1:19:51.520]  AkolaBlue is a state-of-the-art atmospheric water generator producing purified drinking
[1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:58.160]  water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light

[1:20:20.320 --> 1:20:24.320]  Call AkolaBlue right now at 1-800-691-6043.
[1:20:24.320 --> 1:20:34.600]  That's 1-800-691-6043, or visit AkolaBlue at e-c-o-l-o-b-l-u-e.com today.
[1:20:34.600 --> 1:20:37.160]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:20:37.160 --> 1:20:44.160]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:51.640]  What's happened is, for 14 years, myself and others prominently have been exposing the
[1:20:51.640 --> 1:20:53.760]  entire globalist agenda with precision.
[1:20:53.760 --> 1:20:56.120]  See, I'm not a conspiracy theorist.
[1:20:56.120 --> 1:21:01.440]  I'm not somebody covering the abominable snowman and flying saucers and planet X.
[1:21:01.440 --> 1:21:04.720]  The mainstream media always gives attention to all the, I don't want to call them kooks,
[1:21:04.720 --> 1:21:09.520]  they're just dreamers, kind of science fiction writers who, you know, write science fiction
[1:21:09.520 --> 1:21:11.360]  books and call it reality.
[1:21:11.360 --> 1:21:13.200]  That isn't me, folks.
[1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:14.920]  Every time you tune in, what do you hear?
[1:21:14.920 --> 1:21:20.000]  News, documents, articles, legislation.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.120]  That's what you get here.
[1:21:22.120 --> 1:21:26.920]  I study how the world really works, and the fact that Limbaugh now has to admit they're
[1:21:26.920 --> 1:21:29.680]  setting up a one-world government, he's been doing that every day now.
[1:21:29.680 --> 1:21:34.040]  People are sending me the clips after saying it didn't exist for years.
[1:21:34.040 --> 1:21:37.600]  The fact that Glenn Beck's having to say it, the fact that Michael Savage is saying the
[1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:41.360]  government's going to stage terror attacks, that Obama's going to do it, that is incredibly
[1:21:41.360 --> 1:21:44.040]  bold and that's true.
[1:21:44.040 --> 1:21:45.040]  That's true.
[1:21:45.040 --> 1:21:48.320]  And I think a lot of these guys are beginning to realize they're not top man on the totem
[1:21:48.320 --> 1:21:54.800]  pole and this new world order is real and they have no future if they don't stand up.
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:59.320]  And you know, there's no word to describe how big this radio show's getting, how much
[1:21:59.320 --> 1:22:00.320]  it's exploding.
[1:22:00.320 --> 1:22:03.640]  I mean, I'm going to go ahead and talk about the, well, I'll talk about the Obama deception.
[1:22:03.640 --> 1:22:07.440]  I've got some new breaking news for you on it, my new film in the next segment.
[1:22:07.440 --> 1:22:09.480]  Let's go to calls right now or I'll never get to everybody.
[1:22:09.480 --> 1:22:11.520]  Scott, in California, you're on the air.
[1:22:11.520 --> 1:22:14.160]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, bud?
[1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:15.880]  I'm 100% behind you.
[1:22:15.880 --> 1:22:21.200]  I'm actively awaiting the Obama deception in my mailbox so I can burn copies to the
[1:22:21.200 --> 1:22:22.680]  other end of the earth with it.
[1:22:22.680 --> 1:22:26.720]  I have one suggestion, a couple of suggestions.
[1:22:26.720 --> 1:22:34.200]  I need a banner that is your Obama deception poster with him with the mask and his hand
[1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:38.640]  on his chin, some kind of a banner I can buy like architects and engineers so I can go
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:39.640]  out on the street.
[1:22:39.640 --> 1:22:42.920]  You know, I told my, I thought you meant a web banner.
[1:22:42.920 --> 1:22:45.800]  We've got some web banners folks can grab and put out.
[1:22:45.800 --> 1:22:49.840]  It's just we don't have the funds of the personnel or the people to make a bunch of banners
[1:22:49.840 --> 1:22:50.840]  and mail them out.
[1:22:50.840 --> 1:22:53.600]  We need a PDF so I can go to a print shop and print something like that.
[1:22:53.600 --> 1:22:54.600]  But anyway.
[1:22:54.600 --> 1:22:58.480]  So my guys, a month ago, and our graphics people, we've just been so busy they haven't
[1:22:58.480 --> 1:22:59.480]  been done yet.
[1:22:59.480 --> 1:23:03.280]  I've got a note, guys, to give the graphics people that we need to have a banner page,
[1:23:03.280 --> 1:23:05.440]  a promotions page, an activism page.
[1:23:05.440 --> 1:23:06.440]  Absolutely.
[1:23:06.440 --> 1:23:10.080]  Now is the time to have banners and PDFs and things people can print off.
[1:23:10.080 --> 1:23:11.320]  You're absolutely right, sir.
[1:23:11.320 --> 1:23:12.320]  Okay.
[1:23:12.320 --> 1:23:19.000]  And anyway, everybody needs to go to RonPaul.com, the audit, the Federal Reserve, HR 1207.
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  There's a letter there.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:25.360]  Get your congressman and send that out an email to everybody needs to keep doing that
[1:23:25.360 --> 1:23:29.280]  because Ron Paul is well, I mean, think about two weeks ago, Senator Sanders says, tell
[1:23:29.280 --> 1:23:33.640]  me where the money went and private Fed chief Ben Bernanke said, no, yeah, I mean, this
[1:23:33.640 --> 1:23:34.640]  is a fight.
[1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:37.880]  They can't win if the people just stand up and say, yes, bankers, you will tell us where
[1:23:37.880 --> 1:23:38.880]  the money went.
[1:23:38.880 --> 1:23:44.320]  Oh, I mean, we're not the radicals demanding this picture of Volcker, Greenspan and Pulse
[1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:47.320]  and all sharing a joke together on your website.
[1:23:47.320 --> 1:23:48.320]  I know it's disgusting.
[1:23:48.320 --> 1:23:49.320]  Good to hear from you.
[1:23:49.320 --> 1:23:50.320]  I'm Matt in Missouri.
[1:23:50.320 --> 1:23:51.320]  You're on the air here.
[1:23:51.320 --> 1:23:52.320]  Hey, Alex.
[1:23:52.320 --> 1:23:53.320]  I watched Obama's session.
[1:23:53.320 --> 1:23:54.320]  It was awesome.
[1:23:54.320 --> 1:24:01.000]  And my favorite part, I think, was when you name all the people in the Obama administration,
[1:24:01.000 --> 1:24:07.040]  they're in CFR, Bilderberg group, and then we show how one group of CFR, Bilderberg group,
[1:24:07.040 --> 1:24:10.280]  trilateral commission, and we show their quotes from their own publications where they said
[1:24:10.280 --> 1:24:12.680]  they want to destroy America and bring up world government.
[1:24:12.680 --> 1:24:14.400]  So we first document who the groups are.
[1:24:14.400 --> 1:24:18.840]  We show how one group of them leave as bush leaves and a whole other group comes back in.
[1:24:18.840 --> 1:24:20.440]  It's just a revolving door.
[1:24:20.440 --> 1:24:21.440]  Right.
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:29.040]  I'm calling here from the home of the slaves in Missouri where the MIAC strategic report,
[1:24:29.040 --> 1:24:34.520]  you've been talking about this from, and I talked to representative guest staff on Friday
[1:24:34.520 --> 1:24:39.920]  and how you actually had on your show about HCR 13, our sovereignty bill here.
[1:24:39.920 --> 1:24:42.400]  Yeah, yeah, recap for listeners, though.
[1:24:42.400 --> 1:24:44.080]  It's a federally written document.
[1:24:44.080 --> 1:24:45.080]  All the states have it.
[1:24:45.080 --> 1:24:46.960]  This just came out of Missouri, this copy.
[1:24:46.960 --> 1:24:50.920]  We got it out of California, too, saying basically all Americans that love freedom
[1:24:50.920 --> 1:24:51.920]  are bad.
[1:24:51.920 --> 1:24:52.920]  The American flag is bad.
[1:24:52.920 --> 1:24:54.120]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[1:24:54.120 --> 1:24:55.680]  It's up on InfoWars.
[1:24:55.680 --> 1:24:58.280]  All Ron Paul supporters are basically terrorists.
[1:24:58.280 --> 1:24:59.280]  It's just unbelievable.
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:03.200]  So you told the state rep that we've interviewed about it.
[1:25:03.200 --> 1:25:04.200]  What did he say?
[1:25:04.200 --> 1:25:11.200]  Yeah, I asked him if they had seen it and that he had, and he was obviously disturbed
[1:25:11.200 --> 1:25:16.560]  as well as he falls into this also because he has also introduced legislation in here
[1:25:16.560 --> 1:25:17.960]  to stop the North American.
[1:25:17.960 --> 1:25:18.960]  That's right.
[1:25:18.960 --> 1:25:21.760]  It says it doesn't exist and you're insane if you're against it, the terrorist.
[1:25:21.760 --> 1:25:24.560]  Yeah, let's get the Missouri reps back on.
[1:25:24.560 --> 1:25:25.560]  That's a good idea.
[1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:34.840]  Yeah, Jim guest, and he also confirmed that it's independently, as you have also, that
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:35.840]  it's real.
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:38.840]  Well, of course it's real.
[1:25:38.840 --> 1:25:40.720]  We've called and listed the name of the state police.
[1:25:40.720 --> 1:25:43.760]  We called them and they confirmed it's real, but so they won't come on.
[1:25:43.760 --> 1:25:44.760]  Right.
[1:25:44.760 --> 1:25:50.080]  And I guess they also stated that I asked them, you know, where this originally from
[1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:51.080]  when it started.
[1:25:51.080 --> 1:25:56.760]  And I guess it actually started under, was initiated under the previous governor, Matt
[1:25:56.760 --> 1:26:04.240]  Blunt, who I thought was a little bit better about this than you recall.
[1:26:04.240 --> 1:26:09.440]  He's also the one that said that the Obama just, you know, were fascist when they said
[1:26:09.440 --> 1:26:12.400]  that you're illegal to criticize Obama in Missouri.
[1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:13.400]  Absolutely.
[1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:14.760]  Just amazing.
[1:26:14.760 --> 1:26:15.760]  Good to hear from you.
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:16.760]  Good idea.
[1:26:16.760 --> 1:26:17.760]  Mark in Oregon.
[1:26:17.760 --> 1:26:19.640]  Mark, you're on the air, sir.
[1:26:19.640 --> 1:26:20.640]  Thank you for holding.
[1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:23.040]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:24.040]  Great to speak with you.
[1:26:24.040 --> 1:26:25.520]  Great to speak to you.
[1:26:25.520 --> 1:26:29.520]  Alex, you know, I originally called in the day when I called.
[1:26:29.520 --> 1:26:34.000]  I had in mind to ask you, I have a, what I think is a good argument against the legality
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:38.760]  of the individual state's residents of the 50 states having to pay the federal income
[1:26:38.760 --> 1:26:39.760]  tax.
[1:26:39.760 --> 1:26:44.000]  I'm going to save that one for another time because, you know, since I had that idea and
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:47.680]  I've been listening to you over the last half hour, 20 minutes, you've mentioned a
[1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:54.160]  few things, just shows me two lateness of the hour where they seem to have their buttons
[1:26:54.160 --> 1:27:00.800]  all in a row, so to speak, and they're ready to push them, everything's in place.
[1:27:00.800 --> 1:27:06.240]  I was wondering if you could extrapolate from me briefly your knowledge in two areas.
[1:27:06.240 --> 1:27:10.840]  The first one would be what's keeping them from moving.
[1:27:10.840 --> 1:27:17.280]  The second one would be what in your estimation at this point, at this late date and time
[1:27:17.280 --> 1:27:25.000]  relative to the full development of their cage for humanity on the various levels of
[1:27:25.000 --> 1:27:27.680]  their entrapment and enslavement of humanity.
[1:27:27.680 --> 1:27:34.320]  Is there a significant to your knowledge, Alex, element within the military and in the
[1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:35.320]  police?
[1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:40.480]  The old keepers, that was beautiful, I love to hear that, will it spread fast enough in
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:41.480]  your estimation?
[1:27:41.480 --> 1:27:45.920]  I know you're trying to make it happen and do everything that you can to do that, as
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:49.640]  well as the state legislature's being more and more informed, and I believe that you've
[1:27:49.640 --> 1:27:51.400]  been informing all the way up the line.
[1:27:51.400 --> 1:27:55.440]  I've had that picture I've been listening to you about two, two and a half years and
[1:27:55.440 --> 1:27:59.720]  I've always just had that general picture in my mind when it comes to your audience
[1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:04.440]  of just us common folks out here, but I think you've filtered up as well and the people
[1:28:04.440 --> 1:28:05.440]  are you kidding?
[1:28:05.440 --> 1:28:09.480]  I mean, Bruce Willis was a big neocon till he saw my film, Rick Linkletters on record.
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:12.840]  We made a film with him here in Austin two years ago and Rick came on my show and said
[1:28:12.840 --> 1:28:15.560]  we've woken up Bruce Willis and then people didn't believe it.
[1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:18.960]  Then Bruce Willis told Vanity Fair, he knows there's a new world order that killed Kennedy
[1:28:18.960 --> 1:28:23.120]  and is running everything and that he doesn't like either political party now.
[1:28:23.120 --> 1:28:27.320]  Look, that is a, and I had Chuck Norris on saying I woke him up Friday.
[1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:29.720]  I mean, we're waking everybody up here.
[1:28:29.720 --> 1:28:33.360]  I mean, they show clips of our films and the Japanese diet.
[1:28:33.360 --> 1:28:37.280]  You know, in their government, I mean, we're got the Japanese government I can have former
[1:28:37.280 --> 1:28:39.120]  German defense ministers on.
[1:28:39.120 --> 1:28:40.120]  We've woken up.
[1:28:40.120 --> 1:28:43.200]  I mean, it's scary the responsibility we have.
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:50.400]  We have the world's eye and it's just a lot of pressure.
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:55.080]  I'll tell you that right now to try to do the best job I can to try to maintain my energy
[1:28:55.080 --> 1:28:57.440]  level.
[1:28:57.440 --> 1:29:02.720]  I for, you know, I've never been involved in South by Southwest because, but independent
[1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:07.600]  film channel asked me to go out and do some promotions this weekend and Friday.
[1:29:07.600 --> 1:29:12.560]  And I mean, I've just probably done 20, 30 newspaper, TV interviews since then and I'm
[1:29:12.560 --> 1:29:15.240]  just as long tried now.
[1:29:15.240 --> 1:29:19.720]  But look, you're asking about, well, the caller asked a bunch of big questions.
[1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:25.800]  How, why haven't they executed their new terror operation yet and will we be able to stop
[1:29:25.800 --> 1:29:33.240]  them all, answer that when we get back and take your calls?
[1:29:33.240 --> 1:29:40.640]  The new world order beast is genetically modifying your food, genetically modifying, mixing vegetables
[1:29:40.640 --> 1:29:46.120]  with animals and now experimenting with viruses.
[1:29:46.120 --> 1:29:54.440]  Without a long term food solution, you will have just two options, starve or surrender.
[1:29:54.440 --> 1:30:03.160]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out what then, then go your own healthy food
[1:30:03.160 --> 1:30:05.600]  and feed your family forever.

[1:33:37.360 --> 1:33:49.240]  Be sure to visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:33:49.240 --> 1:33:52.800]  You know, I'm not whining when I say I've probably done 30 interviews the last three
[1:33:52.800 --> 1:34:00.040]  or four days with newspapers, TV, PBS, independent film channel, Wired Magazine, on and on and
[1:34:00.040 --> 1:34:01.040]  on.
[1:34:01.040 --> 1:34:04.920]  For four days, one of the chief writers at Politico, which is huge, tried to get a hold
[1:34:04.920 --> 1:34:05.920]  of me.
[1:34:05.920 --> 1:34:07.080]  And I never got back with him.
[1:34:07.080 --> 1:34:11.520]  He was like calling people in England, my webmaster, trying to get me Saturday night.
[1:34:11.520 --> 1:34:16.160]  And I called him right after he'd filed the story and it's out today.
[1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:20.200]  But we're quoted all in the big headline story at Politico right now, but this just
[1:34:20.200 --> 1:34:21.200]  came in.
[1:34:21.200 --> 1:34:29.360]  Bilderberg's excited conspiracy, conspiraciest, and it just goes through it all here.
[1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:34.960]  And this is one popular website, prisonplanet.com, greeted the nomination with the headline,
[1:34:34.960 --> 1:34:37.360]  Obama picks Bilderberg for health secretary.
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:38.840]  I haven't had time to read the whole article yet.
[1:34:38.840 --> 1:34:44.680]  It's very lengthy and it goes on here to say it talks about the secret meeting that the
[1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:50.440]  Obama deception covers.
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:55.040]  It documents all of that because we show how Obama literally had the reporters locked on
[1:34:55.040 --> 1:34:58.640]  a plane, said he was getting on board to go to Chicago, advertised he was going there,
[1:34:58.640 --> 1:35:02.440]  locked him on the plane at Dulles two miles, three miles away from Bilderberg meeting this
[1:35:02.440 --> 1:35:06.080]  year and then he pulled in with Hillary and they had their secret meeting and they admitted
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:09.600]  it was a secret meeting on the news, but then lied about where it was in Georgetown or their
[1:35:09.600 --> 1:35:11.480]  places in D.C.
[1:35:11.480 --> 1:35:14.400]  But so we actually got some credit there for breaking that.
[1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:20.680]  This is big news folks, Politico is as big as the New York Times now in a political news
[1:35:20.680 --> 1:35:23.520]  coverage.
[1:35:23.520 --> 1:35:27.720]  And they cover info wars.net here, boy, I tell you, this is just amazing coverage they
[1:35:27.720 --> 1:35:28.720]  gave us.
[1:35:28.720 --> 1:35:32.160]  Man, I dropped the ball missing this one, but I mean, I miss these interviews constantly.
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:33.960]  I can't work this hard.
[1:35:33.960 --> 1:35:36.800]  I can't keep track of it any more.
[1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:41.560]  I'm supposed to go do more media interviews tonight and I'm about to collapse folks and
[1:35:41.560 --> 1:35:47.440]  you know, then I've got the callers calling in asking me incredibly important questions
[1:35:47.440 --> 1:35:55.480]  and again, I could spend five hours answering the question with detail and facts and proof
[1:35:55.480 --> 1:35:58.880]  of saying, you know, they've got their whole new order set up, their police state grid,
[1:35:58.880 --> 1:36:06.960]  their surveillance grid in place, when will they launch the next big stage terror attack?
[1:36:06.960 --> 1:36:09.360]  Alex and why haven't they pulled the trigger yet?
[1:36:09.360 --> 1:36:10.720]  And then will we be able to stop them?
[1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:13.040]  I mean, those are just such weighty questions.
[1:36:13.040 --> 1:36:15.840]  Oh, I'm trying to answer that question.
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:21.200]  It's just, I, questions that important, I don't want to not do justice to them by giving
[1:36:21.200 --> 1:36:36.840]  it a half, half detailed question, about to say something else, but look, they do stunts.
[1:36:36.840 --> 1:36:38.280]  They don't just stage terror attacks.
[1:36:38.280 --> 1:36:43.720]  They do stunts, Madison Avenue package stunts like Obama, the great leftists to repudiate
[1:36:43.720 --> 1:36:46.640]  Bush and fix everything and save everybody.
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:52.040]  As soon as that hype wears down, as soon as, well, they take six months a year, two years,
[1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:55.720]  as soon as the approval rating starts dropping down to about 50.
[1:36:55.720 --> 1:36:59.400]  That's when the globalist will stage terror attacks as the new stunt to get everybody
[1:36:59.400 --> 1:37:01.600]  hyped up and emotional and going along with the agenda.
[1:37:01.600 --> 1:37:05.280]  You know, the big stunts they're launching now are Obama and the world economic crisis
[1:37:05.280 --> 1:37:09.440]  they've engineered, saying the solution, the economy won't get better until you accept
[1:37:09.440 --> 1:37:12.480]  a new bank of the world that you pay your taxes directly to.
[1:37:12.480 --> 1:37:16.160]  And if the world accepts that, which they're now proposing in every major publication in
[1:37:16.160 --> 1:37:20.040]  the world, I mean everything, I mean just thousands of articles, New York Times, Wall
[1:37:20.040 --> 1:37:27.080]  Street Journal, Time Magazine, Newsweek, meanwhile there were, I'm not kidding, probably 30 articles
[1:37:27.080 --> 1:37:31.920]  that I've seen in the last three days attacking me in mainstream news saying I'm delusional
[1:37:31.920 --> 1:37:36.160]  and world government doesn't exist.
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:41.200]  When I was walking out of my main office today, I just saw this laying there on the desk.
[1:37:41.200 --> 1:37:45.060]  We need a bank of the world, Newsweek, the financial crisis is global and only international
[1:37:45.060 --> 1:37:46.520]  central bank can deal with it.
[1:37:46.520 --> 1:37:49.680]  And you read the article, it calls for world government run by the banks.
[1:37:49.680 --> 1:37:55.120]  And then there's all these other publications saying I'm crazy, it doesn't exist.
[1:37:55.120 --> 1:37:58.600]  And it's kind of scary to have this much mainstream media paying attention to me and attacking
[1:37:58.600 --> 1:37:59.600]  me.
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:00.600]  Politico doesn't.
[1:38:00.600 --> 1:38:03.280]  I scanned over, it looks pretty fair.
[1:38:03.280 --> 1:38:07.920]  That's even more scary.
[1:38:07.920 --> 1:38:09.280]  You know, will we beat these people?
[1:38:09.280 --> 1:38:10.280]  Will we stop them?
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:12.480]  We got a good chance of it because we planted all these seeds.
[1:38:12.480 --> 1:38:14.880]  We need to tell what was going to happen, when it was going to happen, how it was going
[1:38:14.880 --> 1:38:16.880]  to happen in our proof.
[1:38:16.880 --> 1:38:20.800]  And so when I open the phones up now, especially on the weekday show, because there's more
[1:38:20.800 --> 1:38:27.440]  phone lines and people can get in, well, you hear it every day, police call in.
[1:38:27.440 --> 1:38:30.800]  You'll even hear the squad car, you know, radio going off.
[1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:33.600]  They're like, yeah, I know they're training us for martial law and mass graves and we
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:35.360]  don't like it.
[1:38:35.360 --> 1:38:38.560]  And then I have city officials on and I have people on, you know, who are, FEMA's getting
[1:38:38.560 --> 1:38:39.560]  them ready for it.
[1:38:39.560 --> 1:38:42.960]  I don't know if they're going to pull the trigger, but we're held hostage by the bankers.
[1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:47.600]  They've got the police state martial law gun to our head.
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:48.600]  So I don't know.
[1:38:48.600 --> 1:38:49.600]  Okay.
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:56.160]  I want to go to your calls, but on the Obama deception, listen to me very, very carefully,
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:01.600]  please, and don't take what I'm about to say for granted.
[1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:06.120]  Don't take this information I'm about to put out for granted.
[1:39:06.120 --> 1:39:08.480]  Okay.
[1:39:08.480 --> 1:39:15.280]  We got a lot of threats and a lot of stuff happened early last week that was clear evidence
[1:39:15.280 --> 1:39:22.720]  that the establishment was going to try to shut down our main servers so that I couldn't
[1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:26.760]  put the Obama deception out this evening with the set premier time of 6pm central on the
[1:39:26.760 --> 1:39:32.400]  show ended March 15th, the people strike back the Obama deception.
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:35.800]  So I launched it Wednesday night within 24 hours.
[1:39:35.800 --> 1:39:39.680]  That was number one on YouTube and Google, number one video.
[1:39:39.680 --> 1:39:43.160]  They then knocked us off the top spot and just took us completely out of the ratings
[1:39:43.160 --> 1:39:46.880]  because they can't, these things are bigger than national television when you're on the
[1:39:46.880 --> 1:39:48.840]  front page of Google and YouTube.
[1:39:48.840 --> 1:39:53.880]  When you're number one, it's a domino effect like loose change, getting over 100 million
[1:39:53.880 --> 1:39:57.120]  views on Google documented in a two year period.
[1:39:57.120 --> 1:39:58.320]  They had to knock us out.
[1:39:58.320 --> 1:39:59.320]  They did.
[1:39:59.320 --> 1:40:00.320]  They expunged it.
[1:40:00.320 --> 1:40:01.320]  It's still there.
[1:40:01.320 --> 1:40:04.320]  It's just not on their main page.
[1:40:04.320 --> 1:40:06.440]  Okay.
[1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:07.600]  Now I put the film out.
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:12.560]  It's on prisonplanet.tv for members in high quality, 15 cents a day, 5.95 a month, burn
[1:40:12.560 --> 1:40:16.400]  it to DIVX disc, great activism, get it out to everybody.
[1:40:16.400 --> 1:40:20.480]  The DVDs, the super high quality that everybody should have the Obama deception, start shipping
[1:40:20.480 --> 1:40:21.480]  tomorrow.
[1:40:21.480 --> 1:40:24.680]  Get them at infowars.com and that's the way to see it.
[1:40:24.680 --> 1:40:31.080]  Now with hard, I noticed by Thursday morning hundreds of copies of the Obama deception
[1:40:31.080 --> 1:40:32.600]  all over the internet.
[1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:34.640]  Now I was pleased that it was ripped everywhere.
[1:40:34.640 --> 1:40:35.640]  I knew that would happen.
[1:40:35.640 --> 1:40:36.960]  That was my plan.
[1:40:36.960 --> 1:40:42.320]  But in horror, people were so excited to get it up quick that they uploaded it in low
[1:40:42.320 --> 1:40:44.560]  quality to YouTube and Google.
[1:40:44.560 --> 1:40:46.680]  Everybody did this because that meant theirs got up first.
[1:40:46.680 --> 1:40:49.840]  They're saying it takes more time to upload it in high quality.
[1:40:49.840 --> 1:40:55.840]  So the horrible end codes, totally ugly, looks like 2,000 quality video.
[1:40:55.840 --> 1:40:59.360]  Whereas it's almost DVD quality on some of the downloads we've got at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:02.580]  I mean, if you're going to spend two hours watching something, folks, have a little respect
[1:41:02.580 --> 1:41:05.920]  for yourself and us and buy the thing.
[1:41:05.920 --> 1:41:11.160]  We wanted to go virally for free to everybody, but it is not as effective looking like total
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:14.160]  crud with pixels all over it.
[1:41:14.160 --> 1:41:17.120]  So I was just completely disgusted with that.
[1:41:17.120 --> 1:41:21.760]  But a great channel who's got a director channel, meaning put more than 10 minute clips up,
[1:41:21.760 --> 1:41:27.480]  changed the channel on, that's his handle, on YouTube.
[1:41:27.480 --> 1:41:33.240]  Millions of views on, his videos have been viewed millions of times once he posted the
[1:41:33.240 --> 1:41:34.240]  Obama deception.
[1:41:34.240 --> 1:41:38.160]  It is the best end code I've ever seen on YouTube.
[1:41:38.160 --> 1:41:43.520]  I mean, it is a crystal clear end code on YouTube.
[1:41:43.520 --> 1:41:47.680]  And I've told Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson this morning I made the decision, though this will
[1:41:47.680 --> 1:41:53.440]  financially devastate us, I don't even care anymore, folks, I'm posting on the front page
[1:41:53.440 --> 1:42:01.120]  of info wars in prison planet, these really good high quality copy of the Obama deception.
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:04.920]  Now the psychology behind this is then people say, you know, here's a film cost me a hundred
[1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:08.880]  thousand to make.
[1:42:08.880 --> 1:42:10.780]  And the day it's released, I put it off for free.
[1:42:10.780 --> 1:42:15.640]  So please don't take that for granted, folks, understand I'm doing this because we, they're
[1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:18.680]  going to stage more terror and bring in complete martial law.
[1:42:18.680 --> 1:42:22.440]  They're now announcing North com troops on the streets, FEMA camps, the American people
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:25.960]  are terrorist, even Michael Savage is admitting the government's going to stage a terror attack
[1:42:25.960 --> 1:42:27.680]  for martial law.
[1:42:27.680 --> 1:42:29.760]  People in the know understand this is real.
[1:42:29.760 --> 1:42:31.240]  Do you read me?
[1:42:31.240 --> 1:42:33.800]  This is not about me being a filmmaker or people liking me.
[1:42:33.800 --> 1:42:35.040]  I don't care.
[1:42:35.040 --> 1:42:40.160]  You know, if this new order wasn't coming down on us, folks, I'd be a farmer or a rancher.
[1:42:40.160 --> 1:42:41.880]  I mean, I like to fiddle around in the yard.
[1:42:41.880 --> 1:42:43.560]  I like to be out in the outdoors.
[1:42:43.560 --> 1:42:44.920]  I like to camp.
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:46.560]  I like to jog every morning, lift weights.
[1:42:46.560 --> 1:42:47.560]  I don't even do that.
[1:42:47.560 --> 1:42:50.920]  And I'm a big fat blob because of it because all I do is work.
[1:42:50.920 --> 1:42:52.520]  I hardly see my children.
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:42:57.760]  I do this because I'm totally and completely dedicated to this fight.
[1:42:57.760 --> 1:42:59.880]  And I've made this film.
[1:42:59.880 --> 1:43:08.400]  Curt Nimmo posted a nice review out of a New York publication for the Obama deception.
[1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:12.680]  And in that, at info wars.com, a review of the Obama deceptions, what it's called top
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:15.880]  story in there is the link to the high quality YouTube.
[1:43:15.880 --> 1:43:20.240]  Now the problem is there's cruddy copies with hundreds of thousands of views apiece, hundreds
[1:43:20.240 --> 1:43:23.720]  of them, and the super high quality has like 10,000 views.
[1:43:23.720 --> 1:43:25.220]  Let's make it number one.
[1:43:25.220 --> 1:43:28.720]  So when folks Google the Obama deception, that's all they see.
[1:43:28.720 --> 1:43:30.720]  But for that to happen, it's got to get more views.
[1:43:30.720 --> 1:43:36.360]  So info wars.com, your food storage.com has been helping families prepare with the lowest

[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:43.800]  Okay, let's go to Ingrid in Las Vegas, Ingrid you're on the air.
[1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:44.800]  Yes.
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:50.600]  I love you and listen to you every day, do you remember back in August I called you because
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:55.000]  my friend and me got pulled over by the cops because of the cops.
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:59.760]  It was the Ron Paul sticker and it didn't shoot video of that in Las Vegas and put it
[1:49:59.760 --> 1:50:01.760]  on YouTube.
[1:50:01.760 --> 1:50:07.720]  You posted on intro wars and some of the comments that we got were really upsetting, people
[1:50:07.720 --> 1:50:08.720]  said that we made.
[1:50:08.720 --> 1:50:12.400]  That's because they teach the police that Ron Paul supporters are terrorists because
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:15.080]  you love America, we have the secret government documents.
[1:50:15.080 --> 1:50:19.720]  So now I'm called a terrorist, that's about the worst thing you can be called, that's
[1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:20.720]  worse than the murderer.
[1:50:20.720 --> 1:50:23.720]  No, no, because we know the bankers are the criminals, they're the real criminals, the
[1:50:23.720 --> 1:50:27.400]  real terrorists and so they've got to say we're the terrorists.
[1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:29.880]  I don't know if I should laugh or cry about this.
[1:50:29.880 --> 1:50:33.320]  Well, they're losing the fight right now, look at how everybody's starting to wake up.
[1:50:33.320 --> 1:50:34.840]  Yeah, yeah, I know.
[1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:38.800]  Yeah, Ingrid, so the cop pulls you over, there's video of it, thank God you had a camera,
[1:50:38.800 --> 1:50:41.360]  he starts, you're evil Ron Paul sticker, how dare you?
[1:50:41.360 --> 1:50:44.640]  Yeah, and the intro wars sticker also.
[1:50:44.640 --> 1:50:46.640]  How dare you, how dare you being informed?
[1:50:46.640 --> 1:50:48.720]  The stickers are still on the car.
[1:50:48.720 --> 1:50:52.200]  Well, pretty soon they're going to say we're all terrorists, I mean, you know.
[1:50:52.200 --> 1:50:54.200]  I know, this is crazy.
[1:50:54.200 --> 1:50:57.680]  It's absolutely insane, we are not terrorists.
[1:50:57.680 --> 1:51:01.560]  Hey, good to hear from you, yeah, I need to, I should ask her the name of the video,
[1:51:01.560 --> 1:51:04.840]  I mean, I know we posted it when she posted it on YouTube, but I can't remember the name
[1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:08.600]  of it, but yeah, Ron Paul stickers, you're all kind of, but I mean, now Chuck Norris is
[1:51:08.600 --> 1:51:11.520]  on her side, now Michael Savage is saying the government stages terror attacks, I mean,
[1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:14.480]  everybody's waking up, I mean, are they terrorists too?
[1:51:14.480 --> 1:51:17.120]  Let's go ahead and talk to Max in Michigan, you're on the air Max.
[1:51:17.120 --> 1:51:18.760]  Hey, how's it going Alex?
[1:51:18.760 --> 1:51:19.760]  Good, sir.
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:24.160]  I just want to say I really like that video, the Obama deception, I think it's going to
[1:51:24.160 --> 1:51:27.840]  help definitely break down the boundaries between the left and the right.
[1:51:27.840 --> 1:51:31.840]  Yeah, it doesn't attack him from a phony right-wing perspective, it shows he's a front man for
[1:51:31.840 --> 1:51:32.840]  the bankers.
[1:51:32.840 --> 1:51:38.520]  Yeah, I see the whole argument being a lot harder after this video, it really gets big
[1:51:38.520 --> 1:51:43.880]  of, you know, the new world order being this good, you know, system to run to.
[1:51:43.880 --> 1:51:49.000]  I see people really getting to be waking up from this film and realize that the new world
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:55.360]  order is, you know, a one world banking system that is going to drag America down, you know.
[1:51:55.360 --> 1:51:59.640]  Absolutely, and this film exposes how they orchestrated the economic crisis and are
[1:51:59.640 --> 1:52:03.840]  bringing in world government, and we show Henry Kissinger admitting that Obama's going
[1:52:03.840 --> 1:52:07.920]  to set up world government, and we have the troops admitting that the Pentagon's ordering
[1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:12.440]  them to set up martial law, it is all documented in the film, thank you sir for the support.
[1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:14.960]  Corey and Denver, Colorado, you're on the air.
[1:52:14.960 --> 1:52:16.960]  How are you doing?
[1:52:16.960 --> 1:52:17.960]  Good sir.
[1:52:17.960 --> 1:52:23.720]  Yeah, I was just calling, I put on, I just signed up for the prison planet and just did
[1:52:23.720 --> 1:52:27.640]  that two day, you know, when you announced that you were going to release Obama Deception,
[1:52:27.640 --> 1:52:32.520]  I had to get it before the FBI got it, you know, so I got that on my external hard drive
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:36.840]  and I'm going to burn a bunch of DVDs, I go to a film school out here, so I'm 20, I'm
[1:52:36.840 --> 1:52:41.000]  a young guy and I'm just trying to spread the word out to all my fellow filmmakers
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:45.640]  and I'm making my own films, trying to support you and going on that path.
[1:52:45.640 --> 1:52:46.640]  Good.
[1:52:46.640 --> 1:52:52.280]  But yeah, I just want to let you know, some of the bands I listen to, the regulation CD
[1:52:52.280 --> 1:52:59.560]  that they've been putting out, pretty much track for track, every work and every word
[1:52:59.560 --> 1:53:00.560]  about the New World Order.
[1:53:00.560 --> 1:53:07.360]  No, I know, I mean, we talked to Muse, they wear my t-shirts on stage, on worldwide TV,
[1:53:07.360 --> 1:53:12.360]  Radiohead, I mean, just a huge band after a huge band now are listening to the radio
[1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:13.360]  show.
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:16.800]  Yeah, I mean, Fripp Noss' new album is all hope is gone and...
[1:53:16.800 --> 1:53:17.800]  No, no, they're big.
[1:53:17.800 --> 1:53:21.280]  I'm not particularly like their whole angle myself because it's pretty dark stuff, but
[1:53:21.280 --> 1:53:24.440]  they invited Burma South to their show a few weeks ago in Austin, they're big fans.
[1:53:24.440 --> 1:53:27.160]  Yeah, we definitely have a message to be spread.
[1:53:27.160 --> 1:53:28.160]  August Brings.
[1:53:28.160 --> 1:53:29.160]  Motley Cruehr, big fans.
[1:53:29.160 --> 1:53:33.000]  I mean, there's basically anybody we ever talked to who knows about the New World Order.
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:36.600]  Definitely catching the younger demographic and I love hearing that, you know.
[1:53:36.600 --> 1:53:39.800]  You know, Bob Dylan knows about the New World Order, let me tell you who else knows about
[1:53:39.800 --> 1:53:40.800]  the New World Order.
[1:53:40.800 --> 1:53:44.080]  Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura, I'm not going to just go on for hours.
[1:53:44.080 --> 1:53:45.080]  Yeah, it's good.
[1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:50.520]  And, you know, I just wanted to do a good job on the movie aside and tell all my friends
[1:53:50.520 --> 1:53:51.520]  about it.
[1:53:51.520 --> 1:53:57.920]  So, good job on that and I just want to say, you know, the big thing now, I guess, is the
[1:53:57.920 --> 1:54:02.520]  the both of you and getting your immune system boosted up.
[1:54:02.520 --> 1:54:03.520]  Absolutely.
[1:54:03.520 --> 1:54:08.080]  But listen, what's going to make this film unstoppable as you spread the word about the
[1:54:08.080 --> 1:54:14.520]  Obama deception is now out and get the super high quality DVD, just so crystal clear, so
[1:54:14.520 --> 1:54:25.960]  professionally done, order the hard copy at infowars.com or call toll free 888-253-3139-888-253-3139.
[1:54:25.960 --> 1:54:26.960]  Folks always say I don't give them a warning.
[1:54:26.960 --> 1:54:28.360]  I just work the number out.
[1:54:28.360 --> 1:54:29.360]  Grab a pen and paper, folks.
[1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:33.880]  The point is, get the DVD, have screenings at your home, have parties, viewing parties,
[1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:37.680]  show them this, say, hey, this exposes Bush and Obama, explain to liberals, hey, they're
[1:54:37.680 --> 1:54:39.320]  setting Obama up as their front.
[1:54:39.320 --> 1:54:41.040]  He'll take the blame for their agenda.
[1:54:41.040 --> 1:54:46.920]  This is not an anti, you know, Obama film as much as it is exposing the real agenda.
[1:54:46.920 --> 1:54:49.040]  They got to see the Obama deception.
[1:54:49.040 --> 1:54:50.280]  Help us get it out to everybody.
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:52.480]  You were unstoppable if you take action.
[1:54:52.480 --> 1:54:56.320]  It's already been one day, the number one video on YouTube and Google.
[1:54:56.320 --> 1:54:57.760]  So they took it off the main page.
[1:54:57.760 --> 1:54:59.960]  Let's not, that's because they're scared.
[1:54:59.960 --> 1:55:00.960]  They're scared of this.
[1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:01.960]  Tim and Austin, go ahead.
[1:55:01.960 --> 1:55:02.960]  Hi, Alex.
[1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:04.960]  I just watched Obama deception.
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:05.960]  Awesome.
[1:55:05.960 --> 1:55:06.960]  Awesome movie.
[1:55:06.960 --> 1:55:07.960]  Let's get it immediately.
[1:55:07.960 --> 1:55:09.680]  There's a great timing on getting it out.
[1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:12.880]  People probably think it's a little earlier before he puts the whole plan into effect,
[1:55:12.880 --> 1:55:17.720]  but great timing because the plan may shut down some of that distribution here shortly.
[1:55:17.720 --> 1:55:20.480]  That two quick questions, time is short.
[1:55:20.480 --> 1:55:24.680]  Why is Ron Paul not suing these scum in Missouri who are naming him as a terrorist?
[1:55:24.680 --> 1:55:26.760]  Why is that not some kind of defamation suit?
[1:55:26.760 --> 1:55:29.440]  Well, I just talked to Ron Paul the day before this broke.
[1:55:29.440 --> 1:55:33.080]  We had him on this week and I know people have talked to his office.
[1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:36.600]  They weren't even aware of it and I need to get a hold of him.
[1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:42.080]  I've just been real busy myself and he's very busy and I should file a personal lawsuit
[1:55:42.080 --> 1:55:43.080]  myself.
[1:55:43.080 --> 1:55:44.080]  I'm opposed to RFID.
[1:55:44.080 --> 1:55:48.200]  I'm opposed and they lump us as white supremacists.
[1:55:48.200 --> 1:55:52.520]  They say anybody that's against the North American Union is a white supremacist that
[1:55:52.520 --> 1:55:56.320]  wants to kill police and they say, if you have a libertarian sticker, you're basically
[1:55:56.320 --> 1:55:59.360]  a terrorist and that's why the police are harassing everybody.
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:05.200]  They want to make the FBI and the feds wrote it and every state has it.
[1:56:05.200 --> 1:56:10.080]  Can we target somebody who's liable for this defamation?
[1:56:10.080 --> 1:56:15.280]  Well, it's criminal for the government to be putting out secret propaganda to police
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:16.720]  demonizing the American people.
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:19.560]  That's why they say it's secret in the document because they know they're getting a lot of
[1:56:19.560 --> 1:56:20.560]  trouble for this.
[1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:22.760]  Brett in Montana, Brett, you're on the air.
[1:56:22.760 --> 1:56:26.360]  Hey, sir, thanks for having me on again.
[1:56:26.360 --> 1:56:34.480]  Great job on your new film and I have it on my space page and I plan on burning copies
[1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:37.000]  of it as soon as I can.
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:41.520]  What I wanted to talk to you about today was in the past, you've talked about breaking
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:48.120]  up the family and I know exactly what you're talking about.
[1:56:48.120 --> 1:56:51.680]  It's made a lot of problems between my wife and I.
[1:56:51.680 --> 1:56:56.120]  The government textbooks say they want to break up the family and the sitcoms and dramas
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:56:59.240]  have these messages to get men and women to fight with each other.
[1:56:59.240 --> 1:57:00.240]  It's horrible.
[1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:01.240]  It is.
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:09.640]  One of the, well, she's having a hard time talking about all this and it gets into heated
[1:57:09.640 --> 1:57:14.760]  discussions and she just doesn't want to believe sometimes, but I think she's starting to wake
