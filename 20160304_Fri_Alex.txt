[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:19.520]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[00:19.520 --> 00:23.120]  alex jones
[00:23.120 --> 00:30.480]  well what happened last night at that fox news debate shows you why donald trump
[00:30.480 --> 00:38.600]  skipped the last one because it was a bloodbath lynching it reminded me of the
[00:38.600 --> 00:43.840]  movie gladiator a composite actually based on three different events that
[00:43.840 --> 00:48.680]  actually happened in Rome the patriot is based on three different events that
[00:48.680 --> 00:54.880]  actually happened in the revolutionary war but i digress it was like each
[00:54.880 --> 00:59.840]  contest where maximus goes out and wins it gets more rigged where they've got
[00:59.840 --> 01:05.120]  five lions going after him as he battles the former champion and then you've
[01:05.120 --> 01:09.680]  got them stabbing him in the side before they send him out to fight the
[01:09.680 --> 01:15.120]  emperor there was really a roman emperor that actually did that stuff and killed
[01:15.120 --> 01:20.160]  members of his family but that's why history is so fascinating
[01:22.880 --> 01:30.280]  donald trump was basically crucified last night and megan kelly with that
[01:30.280 --> 01:36.480]  blazing perfectly lit perfect makeup look like some type of angelic valkyrie
[01:36.480 --> 01:44.320]  but her eyes had witch-like focus and hatred and they set her up to destroy
[01:44.320 --> 01:49.200]  him they had all these canned video packages and graphics demonizing trump
[01:49.200 --> 01:59.440]  i believe it will backfire on them that said trump probably had his worst
[01:59.440 --> 02:05.240]  performance ever and i've watched all the debates i had our coverage on the
[02:05.240 --> 02:08.920]  laptop and then i had it on the television watching fox news and was
[02:08.920 --> 02:13.440]  basically tuned into both i had earpieces in because my children couldn't
[02:13.440 --> 02:19.360]  stand having two feeds on they were watching fox but i was listening to
[02:19.360 --> 02:23.680]  our feed with our reporters doing a great job breaking it down but it was
[02:23.680 --> 02:31.560]  just over the top and trump a lot of the time basically had his hands down and
[02:31.560 --> 02:39.480]  decide like a boxer who's exhausted it was just such a spectacle it's bigger
[02:39.480 --> 02:43.240]  than trump it's bigger than the american people people the world even it's just
[02:43.240 --> 02:48.880]  a spectacle of controlled corporate media trying to stay relevant desperately
[02:48.880 --> 02:53.800]  trying to control the narrative and trump's numbers only go up the problem
[02:53.800 --> 02:58.920]  is trump is beginning to say he's a unifier and trying to be nice to the
[02:58.920 --> 03:02.920]  mainstream media that is the one thing that will turn people against him
[03:02.920 --> 03:06.560]  because they're so anti-establishment and the establishment must be listening
[03:06.560 --> 03:10.160]  to me because gawker got it right and others actually got it right i can't
[03:10.160 --> 03:15.880]  believe i'm saying gawker got it right when they said that trump was set up and
[03:15.880 --> 03:21.520]  it was a trap when i saw rupert murdoch tweet that oh trump's pretty good
[03:21.520 --> 03:25.600]  and we might as well go ahead and endorse him and be nice to him they knew
[03:25.600 --> 03:29.120]  trump was still thinking about last minute not going they had kelly saying
[03:29.120 --> 03:37.360]  nice things come on in come on in come on in and sit down like the mafia they
[03:37.360 --> 03:41.280]  shoot you right in the back of the head and i just had a feeling when i was
[03:41.280 --> 03:44.520]  leaving the office here staying reading those tweets and things i said this is
[03:44.520 --> 03:49.240]  going to be a bloodbath this is a setup and i saw his son on the sidelines of
[03:49.240 --> 03:54.960]  his wife the staged booing and the hissing and everything being rigged they
[03:54.960 --> 03:59.640]  look like deer in the headlights at the end of that and trump when he talked to
[03:59.640 --> 04:09.800]  bill o'reilly looked like he figured out he'd had his nose bloodied and this was
[04:09.800 --> 04:16.440]  serious it's the first time i've seen trump shaking roger stone is popping in
[04:16.440 --> 04:21.160]  right after the break and but i just imagined thousands of people booing you
[04:21.160 --> 04:26.440]  all rigged packed in there by romney's family member that runs the whole show
[04:26.440 --> 04:34.840]  his niece the light just blown out on him all targeted to where he was glowing
[04:34.840 --> 04:39.360]  look terrible they had just just just lights in his face that's a tactic they
[04:39.360 --> 04:44.160]  use is cranking them way up just everything was scientifically set
[04:44.160 --> 04:52.400]  weeks of planning in that ambush and it just endears trump too many more the
[04:52.400 --> 04:57.040]  problem is some of the things trumps said i don't like including how he likes
[04:57.040 --> 05:04.880]  the head of the cfr who do you prefer barack obama or george w bush well if
[05:04.880 --> 05:09.440]  you haven't figured it out by now these guys are corporate spokesman they're
[05:09.440 --> 05:14.240]  not leaders i mean they both started illegal wars hell they both tortured
[05:14.240 --> 05:18.720]  people they bailed out criminal corporations and they spied on you they
[05:18.720 --> 05:23.680]  both violated the constitution and they even committed war crimes so what's it
[05:23.680 --> 05:28.160]  going to take i mean what will it take to finally wake you up think about it if
[05:28.160 --> 05:33.200]  joseph stalin ran for president as a democrat and adolf hitler ran as a
[05:33.200 --> 05:37.200]  republican one of them would end up leading our country
[05:37.200 --> 05:43.040]  its politics incorporated and your choice between the two parties is a myth
[05:43.040 --> 05:49.040]  because in reality it is a two-party tyranny with one ideology divide and
[05:49.040 --> 05:52.720]  conquer so join the revolution and break the false

[08:08.560 --> 08:12.480]  the united states
[08:12.480 --> 08:16.880]  in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of
[08:16.880 --> 08:20.400]  unwanted influence whether sought or unsought
[08:20.400 --> 08:24.720]  by the military industrial complex and we are as a people
[08:24.720 --> 08:29.360]  inherently and historically opposed to secret societies
[08:29.360 --> 08:33.520]  the secret oaths and the secret proceedings
[08:33.520 --> 08:37.280]  the former grind guide in our newsroom and there has been an attempt that
[08:37.280 --> 08:40.000]  perhaps you know now on the life of president kennedy
[08:40.000 --> 08:47.360]  the initial attack on the destroyer of maddox on August 2nd was repeated today
[08:47.360 --> 08:53.440]  psychological warfare operations went into high gear
[08:53.440 --> 08:58.320]  retaliation for this unprovoked attack on the high seas
[08:58.320 --> 09:03.040]  our forces have struck the bases used by the north vietnamese patrol craft it
[09:03.040 --> 09:13.360]  would allow the president to wage war in vietnam
[09:13.360 --> 09:29.120]  in 1976 flight 455 which took off from venezuela bound for cuba suddenly
[09:29.120 --> 09:32.960]  exploded all 73 passengers and five crew members
[09:32.960 --> 09:44.560]  aboard it died after the plane crashed in the apartment
[09:44.560 --> 09:47.840]  william colby has been missing since April 27th
[09:47.840 --> 09:51.840]  his canoe was found washed up on the banks of the wikamako river
[09:51.840 --> 09:55.040]  April 28th missing and present ground after the
[09:55.040 --> 09:57.760]  marathon i don't have to tell you things are bad
[09:57.760 --> 10:01.440]  everybody knows things are bad i've always felt the

[10:12.000 --> 10:16.480]  all right what is the trilateral commission an organization founded in
[10:16.480 --> 10:20.160]  1973 by david rockenberg the really up to
[10:20.160 --> 10:25.600]  is a scheme to plant their own loyal members in positions of power in this
[10:25.600 --> 10:29.520]  country to work to erase national boundaries and
[10:29.520 --> 10:33.280]  create an international community and in time
[10:33.280 --> 10:37.520]  bring about a one world government with david rockabeller calling the shop i
[10:37.520 --> 10:40.640]  understand he was tapped for sculling bones
[10:40.640 --> 10:45.280]  tapped for it sir he found its sculling bones it's like everything
[10:45.280 --> 10:48.000]  everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.520]  we sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller and
[10:51.520 --> 10:55.440]  all we say is please at least leave us alone in our living rooms let me have
[10:55.440 --> 10:59.120]  my toaster and my tv and my steel built in radios and i won't say
[10:59.120 --> 11:02.720]  anything just leave us alone well i'm not going to leave you alone

[11:29.200 --> 11:33.600]  ladies and gentlemen i have never seen such a staged event the lights turned
[11:33.600 --> 11:36.960]  way up focused right on donald trump's face where
[11:36.960 --> 11:40.560]  he glowed and looked terrible and couldn't think
[11:40.560 --> 11:43.360]  they can turn those stage lights up to where they burn you
[11:43.360 --> 11:47.120]  you could see it i've run a tv studio i've been doing this for 20 plus years
[11:47.120 --> 11:54.160]  i know what i saw the rigged packages the rigged video productions
[11:54.160 --> 11:58.720]  the graphics everything pointed at donald trump
[11:58.720 --> 12:02.720]  will it backfire on them i mean even liberal gawker said donald trump was
[12:02.720 --> 12:06.960]  set up right bart debate disgrace fox news
[12:06.960 --> 12:13.440]  exposes pro rubio super pack facebook refuses to remove for weeks
[12:13.440 --> 12:17.760]  assassinate donald trump page in drudge poll
[12:17.760 --> 12:25.600]  he wins 54.92 doubling what cruise has in a far second 25.56 case second 14
[12:25.600 --> 12:29.440]  rubio at five but still they force feed rubio other scientific polls basically
[12:29.440 --> 12:33.040]  show the same numbers genrich when then we're going to our
[12:33.040 --> 12:38.160]  guests at the bottom of the hour genrich establishment scared of trump
[12:38.160 --> 12:42.400]  because he didn't belong to the secret society let's play that clip
[12:42.400 --> 12:46.000]  uh and now they're faced with a very real prospect of donald trump
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.600]  becoming the leader of the party and it absolutely drives them crazy
[12:49.600 --> 12:53.840]  uh they just cannot imagine sharing well because he's an outsider he's not them
[12:53.840 --> 12:56.800]  he's not part of the club he's uncontrollable
[12:56.800 --> 13:00.160]  uh you know he hasn't been through the initiation rights he didn't belong to
[13:00.160 --> 13:03.600]  the secret society um and i think that they they don't
[13:03.600 --> 13:06.960]  see him they have no idea how to relate to him
[13:06.960 --> 13:09.920]  i can't believe how everything we've talked about for decades is just naked
[13:09.920 --> 13:12.960]  out in the open scalia died the secret society ritual
[13:12.960 --> 13:16.560]  yeah he's not part of the society
[13:17.200 --> 13:21.040]  and by the way there is a society at the top
[13:21.040 --> 13:24.800]  and i tell you it is just amazing i really appreciate
[13:24.800 --> 13:29.200]  uh former campaign head for trump and longtime friend and confidant
[13:29.200 --> 13:32.400]  mr stone who talked to him obviously before and after the debate but that'll
[13:32.400 --> 13:36.320]  go unsaid here today to join us for this segment in the next and then
[13:36.320 --> 13:40.080]  the other news is just over the top bmw says hey soon you'll be able to drive
[13:40.080 --> 13:43.120]  your car uh they've arrested people in six
[13:43.120 --> 13:45.920]  states in a third roundup with the whole bundy thing
[13:45.920 --> 13:48.800]  they're trying to tie that to trump this is getting crazy
[13:48.800 --> 13:52.080]  we've got incredible jobs numbers they're really scary
[13:52.080 --> 13:55.520]  the media spends them as good uh we have got just
[13:55.520 --> 13:59.120]  just so much important stuff today at a bunch of big guests jessie ventura
[13:59.120 --> 14:02.560]  is on in the third hour today on the day of nine to host the fourth
[14:02.560 --> 14:07.760]  hour but roger stone of stonezone.com by selling author
[14:07.760 --> 14:12.800]  joins us let's just be honest about what we saw last night
[14:12.800 --> 14:18.400]  i've never seen such a unified attack it was like julia cesar being stabbed in
[14:18.400 --> 14:23.360]  the senate you know by 15 senators it was just the desperate hate of the
[14:23.360 --> 14:26.720]  establishment not that trump's even perfect but because the
[14:26.720 --> 14:29.920]  establishment's in control they've hijacked things
[14:29.920 --> 14:35.520]  and someone is coming upon their quarry like a group of hyenas and they just
[14:35.520 --> 14:39.360]  think trump maybe wants to you know take over their kill uh they don't even
[14:39.360 --> 14:43.120]  probably think he's good but the spinning the twisting i have
[14:43.120 --> 14:46.640]  never seen anything one tenth is insane
[14:46.640 --> 14:51.280]  uh will this backfire this this this this this new height
[14:51.280 --> 14:54.800]  or did they actually wound trump as some are spinning
[14:54.800 --> 14:58.240]  and then i asked this question if they're willing to do this in their arrogance
[14:58.240 --> 15:02.480]  and meet us naked maybe they'll blow us head off on live tv i mean i hate to
[15:02.480 --> 15:05.600]  talk like that but these people are entitled
[15:05.600 --> 15:09.280]  they're brazen stone i don't know if you agree with me uh to tell me your
[15:09.280 --> 15:12.880]  expert opinion well that was an attempted mugging
[15:12.880 --> 15:16.320]  last night uh look the the uh republican establishment the
[15:16.320 --> 15:20.160]  washington insiders particularly the lobbyist class
[15:20.160 --> 15:24.640]  have woken up and realized that there's a revolution
[15:24.640 --> 15:30.080]  wrote trump off earlier and that was an enormous mistake because he's getting
[15:30.080 --> 15:33.680]  enormous and he's running the table on the primaries
[15:33.680 --> 15:37.360]  at least two campaigns now openly plotting a steal
[15:37.360 --> 15:43.840]  at the convention voter fraud in in texas uh i'm now concerned about voter
[15:43.840 --> 15:47.920]  fraud in florida which is known for voter fraud as you know
[15:47.920 --> 15:51.840]  and ohio where we have numerous complaints of irregularities
[15:51.840 --> 15:56.640]  in the uh in the absentee balloting and early voting process
[15:56.640 --> 16:01.360]  and i think here's where we are alex we have a key date moving up on us quickly
[16:01.360 --> 16:05.760]  march 15th ohio in florida trump wins both
[16:05.760 --> 16:09.440]  he is the certain nominee trump wins one of the two
[16:09.440 --> 16:12.400]  he is the problem
[16:13.040 --> 16:16.720]  which i don't anticipate you're looking at a brokered convention
[16:16.720 --> 16:22.960]  and a mit romney nomination now mr stowe your
[16:22.960 --> 16:25.360]  your style's breaking up we're gonna go back to you here in just a moment to
[16:25.360 --> 16:29.280]  repeat that but but for folks that haven't been following this
[16:29.280 --> 16:33.120]  you know we have you on once six months ago and then two months later and then
[16:33.120 --> 16:36.160]  a month later and then you know every week and then every
[16:36.160 --> 16:39.840]  day and i appreciate your time and you've got a lot of meetings and things to do
[16:39.840 --> 16:43.040]  but the reason i'm having you on so much is everything you've been saying has
[16:43.040 --> 16:45.840]  been coming true though i mean the people thought a few weeks ago that was
[16:45.840 --> 16:47.920]  nuts when you said they're getting romney ready and
[16:47.920 --> 16:50.240]  you know they're going to say they're going to broker convention openly and
[16:50.240 --> 16:52.960]  they're going to try to shave votes so they didn't get 50 percent going into
[16:52.960 --> 16:56.720]  convention so they can challenge it now they admit that's their plan
[16:56.720 --> 17:02.240]  so tell us what's coming next well these two primaries are pivotal
[17:02.240 --> 17:05.760]  i'm very concerned about uh voter irregularities and fraud
[17:05.760 --> 17:10.320]  i think it is essential that trump uh win both ohio and florida
[17:10.320 --> 17:14.480]  as i as i said you may not have gotten because i think the nsa is working with
[17:14.480 --> 17:19.120]  our transmission here i do think if trump wins both ohio and florida on
[17:19.120 --> 17:22.400]  march 15th he's the certain nominee if he wins one
[17:22.400 --> 17:27.360]  of the two he's the probable nominee and should he lose both which i don't
[17:27.360 --> 17:30.160]  anticipate then we'll get ready for the big
[17:30.160 --> 17:33.520]  steal uh this morning i sent a second team out to
[17:33.520 --> 17:37.520]  ohio now in the cincinati area we have complaints about
[17:37.520 --> 17:41.520]  irregularities and absentee balloting we're still looking at texas where i'm
[17:41.520 --> 17:45.360]  convinced that carl rove was in the house we have
[17:45.360 --> 17:50.400]  we have over 600 complaints now of citizens who voted for donald trump only
[17:50.400 --> 17:55.520]  to see their votes tally for another candidate overwhelmingly marco rubio uh
[17:55.520 --> 17:58.800]  i fear the same kind of shenanigans here in florida
[17:58.800 --> 18:01.840]  should we get him to come out and talk about that or will that make it look
[18:01.840 --> 18:05.600]  like shower grapes no i just think that first we
[18:05.600 --> 18:09.120]  have to ascertain what happened we have to document it and then if we have to
[18:09.120 --> 18:13.440]  take legal action to overturn some of these bogus results or
[18:13.440 --> 18:18.800]  results at this point we suspect to be bogus we will do so but it shows you
[18:18.800 --> 18:22.720]  the extent to which the establishment will go alex here in florida
[18:22.720 --> 18:26.320]  you cannot turn on the television or the radio
[18:26.320 --> 18:32.720]  without getting an anti donald trump ad they're spending in florida alone the
[18:32.720 --> 18:37.120]  estimate is 40 million dollars in negative advertising
[18:37.120 --> 18:41.280]  from various entities and is this all just because he's never run with these
[18:41.280 --> 18:45.920]  guys uh or is it really his policies because
[18:45.920 --> 18:50.240]  again i've never seen such hysteria i see the new york times with a headline
[18:50.240 --> 18:53.840]  about america is scared of trump psychologists say
[18:53.840 --> 18:57.360]  everyone's panicking they're just trying to create a mindless
[18:57.360 --> 19:00.880]  hysteria because he says he's not gonna let china have unfair trade deals
[19:00.880 --> 19:04.640]  and wants us to have sovereignty and wants to lower taxes i mean the guy
[19:04.640 --> 19:10.720]  sounds like jfk how is this so alien to the establishment
[19:10.720 --> 19:14.160]  well we've seen this playbook before you maybe remember the full page newspaper
[19:14.160 --> 19:17.040]  ads one thousand psychiatrists say berry
[19:17.040 --> 19:21.680]  goldwater unfit to be president remember that oh yes this is this is the same
[19:21.680 --> 19:24.720]  playbook mit romney is merely doing what his father
[19:24.720 --> 19:28.560]  george romney did it's ruler rule in other words if they
[19:28.560 --> 19:32.480]  cannot steal the nomination from trump they hope to make the
[19:32.480 --> 19:37.200]  nomination worthless so they gave it to lbj with uh the
[19:37.200 --> 19:40.240]  the goldwater situation and and now they're going to try to give it to
[19:40.240 --> 19:43.520]  hillary and they've said we will give it to hillary we'll even wreck the party
[19:43.520 --> 19:46.480]  because they've really just been blue blood democrats all along who took over
[19:46.480 --> 19:49.360]  the party and scuttled it with the rocker fellers
[19:49.360 --> 19:52.880]  well i don't know that this is even ideological i actually think the whole
[19:52.880 --> 19:57.680]  left right divide is a hegellian device that is used to distract us all i
[19:57.680 --> 20:00.960]  heard that there's a small circle of people running things
[20:00.960 --> 20:06.880]  who know no ideology other than money and power this is the hijacker donor class
[20:06.880 --> 20:09.840]  the special interest everybody says they don't want special interest here's the
[20:09.840 --> 20:12.960]  special interest flooding billions of dollars hissy
[20:12.960 --> 20:17.520]  fitting going insane lying every dirty trick i mean
[20:17.520 --> 20:20.960]  even though i didn't like some of his answers last night it doesn't even at
[20:20.960 --> 20:23.440]  this point it's so obvious if you're not for
[20:23.440 --> 20:27.520]  trump you're for the new world order i've never seen it more clear
[20:27.520 --> 20:30.880]  i still think that trump prevails for several reasons one
[20:30.880 --> 20:34.080]  he's probably the best communicator in the country at this point
[20:34.080 --> 20:38.160]  secondarily this is a change of election and hillary clinton
[20:38.160 --> 20:42.160]  represents continuation of the failed policies that we have right now
[20:42.160 --> 20:45.600]  thirdly he's running against hillary clinton enough said
[20:45.600 --> 20:49.840]  fourth uh the uh supreme court hangs in the balance
[20:49.840 --> 20:54.320]  additionally don't think we can't move in on bernie sanders voters
[20:54.320 --> 20:58.480]  those voters aren't hardcore socialists they're just left of senator voters who
[20:58.480 --> 21:02.720]  care as we do the country's been hijacked by a wall street dc look at the
[21:02.720 --> 21:05.120]  other democrat candidate that just dropped out he's saying he's gonna
[21:05.120 --> 21:08.400]  endorse trump yes jim webb a good man a patriot
[21:08.400 --> 21:12.080]  so i still think uh that we have a revolution going here
[21:12.080 --> 21:18.160]  they're trying to crush this revolution uh and uh romney is very definitely as i
[21:18.160 --> 21:21.040]  said on this program he's got the makeup on he's
[21:21.040 --> 21:25.200]  suiting up he's in the bullpen he's waiting for marco rubio to fall flat
[21:25.200 --> 21:30.400]  out on his faith lorda if that doesn't happen he'll endorse rubio if it does
[21:30.400 --> 21:35.840]  happen look permit to jump in and file for california uh and
[21:35.840 --> 21:40.640]  texas pardon california and new jersey those late primaries
[21:40.640 --> 21:44.240]  just so they can act like he got a few delegates so it's okay to steal the
[21:44.240 --> 21:47.600]  nomination and and they're crazy enough you think
[21:47.600 --> 21:52.080]  to actually commit political harry carry and do that well exactly look i think
[21:52.080 --> 21:55.600]  romney understands dominating somebody who didn't receive a single delegate
[21:55.600 --> 21:59.600]  would not go over very well nationally and in the media
[21:59.600 --> 22:04.240]  and in the party so he's getting in to try to rally some late delegates uh
[22:04.240 --> 22:07.520]  they're going to play games in florida they're going to play games
[22:07.520 --> 22:11.600]  i'm very worried about ballot security i'm very very worried about the big
[22:11.600 --> 22:14.400]  steal uh if if your listeners want to help they can
[22:14.400 --> 22:19.360]  go to stopthesteal.org where we are assembling teams of election
[22:19.360 --> 22:24.000]  law experts and election lawyers and dispatching them uh to various places
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.240]  and while your sky's breaking up i'm going to cut in for a moment
[22:28.240 --> 22:31.440]  just cut up for a second uh roger stone is this how the
[22:31.440 --> 22:33.520]  steal goes because you can see him scripting it
[22:33.520 --> 22:36.480]  hey i just came out again because the american people demanded it
[22:36.480 --> 22:40.880]  they'll put out a bunch of fake polls showing that uh trump is going down
[22:40.880 --> 22:45.520]  that'll be basically fake push polls and other garbage uh they will then say
[22:45.520 --> 22:49.520]  look he won these late states it's a referendum showing he's the guy
[22:49.520 --> 22:53.440]  and the delegates have now flipped too because of oh the new scandal
[22:53.440 --> 22:56.880]  whatever that is the scandal desure they put out that time to create another
[22:56.880 --> 23:00.560]  but smoke screen where people kind of pause for a moment
[23:00.560 --> 23:03.280]  when they steal it
[23:04.080 --> 23:07.200]  is that correct roger just of it alex the most important
[23:07.200 --> 23:10.320]  yes i got think you got the gist of it i think the most important thing to
[23:10.320 --> 23:13.600]  recognize is that while trump is going to come very
[23:13.600 --> 23:17.680]  close and perhaps go over the top on the first ballot on the second ballot
[23:17.680 --> 23:22.160]  there are many delegates uh who are no longer bound to him
[23:22.160 --> 23:25.840]  and the actual delegations have been packed with trojan horses with
[23:25.840 --> 23:29.600]  quizlings so they hope to just stall trump short
[23:29.600 --> 23:33.200]  on the first ballot get to the second ballot and then you're going to see
[23:33.200 --> 23:36.560]  they hope a shift in some of these major delegations
[23:36.560 --> 23:40.000]  where trump won the primary where the people have spoken
[23:40.000 --> 23:43.200]  where it's overwhelming but the actual delegates
[23:43.200 --> 23:46.720]  are now free to vote their conscience which means they're
[23:46.720 --> 23:52.480]  free to vote as they are directed by the party insiders and the party bosses
[23:52.480 --> 23:56.960]  what have we got into another situation like you were in the middle of in 2000
[23:56.960 --> 24:00.240]  where there's a recount and the supreme court has to decide it
[24:00.240 --> 24:03.760]  but it's a four four a crisis in the court then the president can do the
[24:03.760 --> 24:07.040]  nuclear option and emergency appoint the supreme
[24:07.040 --> 24:11.120]  court justice that then picks the president well that is a doomsday
[24:11.120 --> 24:14.640]  scenario but i must tell you i put nothing beyond those
[24:14.640 --> 24:19.280]  who are apoplectic about the need to stop trump because he's a nationalist
[24:19.280 --> 24:23.600]  because he stands for uh american sovereignty because he's asking
[24:23.600 --> 24:29.600]  hard questions about 9 11 about the origins of the iraq war about what's
[24:29.600 --> 24:33.920]  going on at the fed uh this is driving the establishment insane
[24:33.920 --> 24:38.480]  absolutely insane they are apoplectic like nothing i have seen
[24:38.480 --> 24:41.440]  in 40 years in american roger stone you're about to leave us in about four
[24:41.440 --> 24:44.000]  minutes i want you to get to any other point you think are a key that we've
[24:44.000 --> 24:48.160]  missed but but but just right now do you think gut level the numbers are
[24:48.160 --> 24:51.920]  coming in they're all out of salt backfires because it's
[24:51.920 --> 24:54.800]  so over the top or they did get a few
[24:54.800 --> 24:58.000]  stabs in last night i don't think this is one of his better performances he
[24:58.000 --> 25:02.560]  still did good in some areas does this damage him by them appearing to make it
[25:02.560 --> 25:05.760]  look like he flip-flop when he was just being honest
[25:05.760 --> 25:09.920]  i mean he wasn't even defending himself like i i endorsed romney i gave 10 times
[25:09.920 --> 25:12.880]  the money literally to romney but she was still a senator
[25:12.880 --> 25:15.920]  and so i have businesses there and i'd basically give to both the senators
[25:15.920 --> 25:19.200]  so yes i did and to her foundation which i didn't know she was gonna steal the
[25:19.200 --> 25:22.000]  money his previous answers he could just sit there
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.240]  and would just let them stab him i was a little disappointed
[25:26.240 --> 25:30.800]  well look i think he held his own but it was you know five on one
[25:30.800 --> 25:35.920]  uh and uh he's a brawler he more than then held his own look i'm not concerned
[25:35.920 --> 25:38.560]  about them taking the steam out of the revolution
[25:38.560 --> 25:42.480]  in terms of the nomination donald trump is going to be the republican nominee
[25:42.480 --> 25:45.920]  because he has overwhelming sure but they're they hate him so much it's
[25:45.920 --> 25:48.400]  clear they're i mean they're not gonna stop so what do you expect
[25:48.400 --> 25:52.000]  it's the general election that i am concerned about it is it is the fact
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.720]  you've got republican governors like in massachusetts
[25:54.720 --> 25:57.920]  now suddenly saying i won't vote for donald trump
[25:57.920 --> 26:00.960]  that we've seen this playbook the donald trump movement
[26:00.960 --> 26:05.440]  point oh is what it is yeah all right other points what do you make of
[26:05.440 --> 26:08.320]  gingrich coming out and saying he's not part of the secret society
[26:08.320 --> 26:14.800]  that is just an amazing statement well new gingrich is a good friend of mine
[26:14.800 --> 26:18.960]  and frankly last night it occurred to me what i really like is the idea of a
[26:18.960 --> 26:23.040]  trump gingrich ticket there is a ticket you need somebody who knows how
[26:23.040 --> 26:26.640]  washington worked but isn't part of the machine
[26:26.640 --> 26:30.240]  he is the obvious guy to me now i've never discussed this
[26:30.240 --> 26:33.760]  uh with the donald trump and as i've told you previously
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.600]  although we talk from time to time those conversations are proprietary i would
[26:37.600 --> 26:40.880]  never divulge personal private conversations but
[26:40.880 --> 26:45.280]  i do know this donald trump has a very high regard for newt gingrich they are
[26:45.280 --> 26:49.280]  friends they met substantially in between the
[26:49.280 --> 26:53.520]  the last presidential campaign and this one that may be the ticket
[26:53.520 --> 26:57.040]  and i think it would go over well with the american people well
[26:57.040 --> 27:00.800]  here's the problem and obviously trump so the real global elite on the laughter
[27:00.800 --> 27:03.760]  him has to probably make some deals or like regent did at the convention or
[27:03.760 --> 27:07.440]  get shot but gingrich has is a globalist i know
[27:07.440 --> 27:09.920]  you're a big dc insider you've written books about it
[27:09.920 --> 27:13.280]  you know some of the things he wrote in alvin hyde toffler's forwards to their
[27:13.280 --> 27:15.600]  books but it is good that he's saying hey
[27:15.600 --> 27:19.200]  trump or hillary he's being honest so i appreciate that
[27:19.200 --> 27:23.520]  but what about the one thing i'm concerned about uh is is
[27:23.520 --> 27:27.360]  him coming out and saying on foreign policy i listened to richard in haas i
[27:27.360 --> 27:30.720]  know they're both from new york cfr's base there
[27:30.720 --> 27:34.720]  we know that he's not part of the cfr but but we know that
[27:34.720 --> 27:38.640]  cruz has been a minion of that his wife but donald trump met with cfr boss
[27:38.640 --> 27:42.480]  richard haas i respect richard haas trump told
[27:42.480 --> 27:46.480]  msnbc also said the debate that that's one of his advisors
[27:46.480 --> 27:50.080]  uh so i'm i'm really concerned with the patriot base that's scaring him it's
[27:50.080 --> 27:54.240]  one thing that scares them uh about uh cruz what do you say to that
[27:54.240 --> 27:58.560]  yeah this was news to me i must tell you i've never heard his name previously
[27:58.560 --> 28:02.560]  within the trump circles i didn't know that there was an association
[28:02.560 --> 28:06.480]  i do know that trump is a strong uh a nationalist so it's
[28:06.480 --> 28:09.840]  somewhat surprising alex i need to research that and tell you more
[28:09.840 --> 28:13.120]  when i learn more well plus trump you know they're saying put out all your
[28:13.120 --> 28:15.840]  policies now so they're like well who are top guys and they're like
[28:15.840 --> 28:18.640]  this is a guy i mean that's what i in fact i looked up
[28:18.640 --> 28:21.360]  trump and haas and i think i've seen one thing where they had dinner at some
[28:21.360 --> 28:25.280]  galo years ago so this this sounds to me like it's a crash course
[28:25.280 --> 28:29.920]  uh in some of those i do know this that that uh that donald was
[28:29.920 --> 28:32.960]  very enamored of the writings of john lanchowski
[28:32.960 --> 28:36.960]  who was a top state department official in the rake administration
[28:36.960 --> 28:40.640]  not a neocon that's right he mentioned him as well yeah
[28:40.640 --> 28:44.400]  not a globalist so uh this this is something that i have to get
[28:44.400 --> 28:49.680]  into a bit more well here's all i know i i don't mindlessly just commit to
[28:49.680 --> 28:52.480]  somebody but but i'm proud of supporting trump he's a maverick
[28:52.480 --> 28:55.520]  he's the tip of the spear he's the representation of populism
[28:55.520 --> 28:58.640]  we know the enemies that have already captured the country hating
[28:58.640 --> 29:02.320]  uh and so it would be a psychotic hundred to one gamble
[29:02.320 --> 29:06.640]  to go against him uh and uh i mean i think the odds are
[29:06.640 --> 29:10.080]  in favor two to one to go with trump i'm committed
[29:10.080 --> 29:13.600]  uh and uh he had to really do some bad stuff for me not to
[29:13.600 --> 29:18.560]  because uh despite questions the attack by the power structure is the is is the
[29:18.560 --> 29:22.960]  certification it's the red badge of courage 20 second closing comment
[29:22.960 --> 29:28.560]  alex um the next days will be pivotal in politics a day as a lifetime i have
[29:28.560 --> 29:32.960]  never seen the velocity of attack of hatred that they are
[29:32.960 --> 29:36.560]  on that they are unloading on trump here in florida i've never
[29:36.560 --> 29:41.760]  seen anything like it whether or not it will work remains to be seen i saw a
[29:41.760 --> 29:46.480]  poll yesterday from a uh a guy with no axe to grind an excellent

[33:22.640 --> 33:27.840]  it's alex joe
[33:27.840 --> 33:31.920]  yeah i'll be completely honest with the audience that's what i always do
[33:31.920 --> 33:37.680]  quite frankly to a neurotic level i just i'm more truthful on air
[33:37.680 --> 33:42.720]  than i even am with my family in private just being honest
[33:42.720 --> 33:47.040]  it's just such an important office that i'm in of being a truth teller
[33:47.040 --> 33:49.440]  because you know with family you won't tell them what you really think about
[33:49.440 --> 33:56.560]  food or where they want to go on vacation you don't want to start stuff up
[33:56.560 --> 34:01.200]  sometimes you just play along i'm sitting around a family reunion people
[34:01.200 --> 34:05.200]  are saying stuff i disagree with the disabled i just ignore it
[34:05.200 --> 34:09.360]  sometimes i even catch myself going oh yeah yeah yeah you're right
[34:09.360 --> 34:14.880]  just uh and then i say man you're you're being lazy you should argue with them
[34:14.880 --> 34:21.600]  but when it comes to being on air i just have to tell you the truth
[34:21.600 --> 34:28.160]  i've talked to a lot of people that have known donald trump for years
[34:28.160 --> 34:35.040]  and he is a narcissistic egomaniac
[34:35.760 --> 34:42.240]  now in modern terms people use the word narcissist
[34:42.240 --> 34:47.680]  like it's a bad thing and they also throw it around because they're not
[34:47.680 --> 34:51.120]  even version of basics of western psychology
[34:51.120 --> 34:55.040]  which itself is obviously an imperfect system and lens
[34:55.040 --> 35:02.720]  but something to see the world through and very effective
[35:03.760 --> 35:09.440]  donald trump is an alpha male donald trump is confident donald trump is
[35:09.440 --> 35:16.160]  aggressive donald trump likes to fight donald trump likes to succeed
[35:16.160 --> 35:19.440]  they have taken those traits and made them negative
[35:19.440 --> 35:24.880]  if you want to succeed at the loss of others just because you like to see
[35:24.880 --> 35:28.560]  people hurt if you don't like to see other people
[35:28.560 --> 35:32.240]  successful then you're a predatory scumbag
[35:32.240 --> 35:35.680]  if you're the type of narcissist that you know doesn't give people a tip
[35:35.680 --> 35:40.960]  when they give you good service who enjoys putting down little people
[35:40.960 --> 35:43.760]  or who enjoys thinking you're better than everybody
[35:43.760 --> 35:48.960]  well that's the modern what we think of a narcissist
[35:48.960 --> 35:52.320]  but when you're really confident and have a vision of yourself
[35:52.320 --> 35:55.600]  as being successful and and building up a country
[35:55.600 --> 35:59.360]  that's just called confidence and leadership
[35:59.360 --> 36:06.480]  and it's good to have manias sure you can be an extreme maniac and just
[36:06.480 --> 36:10.080]  just be totally wild and go compulsively gamble till everything you
[36:10.080 --> 36:13.280]  got is gone or you know go out and be a sex maniac
[36:13.280 --> 36:16.480]  you know who runs around with 10 partners a day or whatever
[36:16.480 --> 36:20.080]  that's the bad end to being a maniac or you can be a maniac sculptor
[36:20.080 --> 36:23.120]  or painter or composer i mean most top composers
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.960]  have like 170 IQs and they are maniacs i don't care if they're japanese or german
[36:28.960 --> 36:32.640]  i don't care if they're mexican or or south african
[36:32.640 --> 36:36.400]  they bounce off the walls
[36:37.120 --> 36:41.920]  i've seen documentaries about it they're all pretty much the same
[36:42.720 --> 36:46.160]  because the way they're tuned into music and movement and and it's it's
[36:46.160 --> 36:50.800]  mathematics of the soul so there's good maniacs and there's
[36:50.800 --> 36:55.120]  bad maniacs and trump really does want to see a
[36:55.120 --> 36:58.800]  prosperous country he's based in the free market he's based in service
[36:58.800 --> 37:02.720]  he's based in real estate he's not a modern globalist
[37:02.720 --> 37:08.320]  that's based in technocracies and centralized total control
[37:09.520 --> 37:14.880]  and people like genrich and haas reaching out to trump which they've done
[37:14.880 --> 37:19.920]  is the real arm of the new world order going hey you don't co-opt him being
[37:19.920 --> 37:24.800]  mean to him and bullying him you come over and do bad cop we're
[37:24.800 --> 37:28.800]  going to do good cop we're going to bring donald trump in
[37:28.800 --> 37:32.800]  you can't stop him and that's the smart way to beat
[37:32.800 --> 37:39.200]  the patriot movement is to co-opt trump without him ever knowing it happened
[37:44.560 --> 37:50.400]  or he won't understand who they are and when he endorses them
[37:50.480 --> 37:53.360]  that will then hurt trump because i've always said the only way to stop trump
[37:53.360 --> 37:57.600]  is to endorse him but the system is so arrogant about themselves they can't do
[37:57.600 --> 38:02.400]  it unless you get to a high-level manager point like newt genrich
[38:02.400 --> 38:05.760]  and richard and haas they're in on the national security meetings
[38:05.760 --> 38:12.160]  they're in on the big han showing they're in on the whole plan
[38:12.160 --> 38:15.520]  just like henry kissinger and david rockefeller and henry kissinger and
[38:15.520 --> 38:19.440]  david rockefeller are fading away brazinski still healthy and sharp so it
[38:19.440 --> 38:25.120]  goes brazinski and then on down stratos but but 30 40 50 people down
[38:25.120 --> 38:29.840]  there in the western anglo-american power structure sits
[38:29.840 --> 38:33.920]  new genrich about 10 above him sits a richard and haas
[38:33.920 --> 38:40.800]  haas is one of the top 15 most powerful globalists in the world
[38:40.800 --> 38:44.480]  he knows where the bodies are buried he's he's he's in the loop for the whole
[38:44.480 --> 38:52.400]  whole show
[38:52.400 --> 38:54.960]  and now we know donald trump's held briefing with richard haas head of
[38:54.960 --> 38:59.600]  council on foreign relations so so so they're coming to him
[38:59.600 --> 39:06.480]  and saying look buddy all right you ran over us we got it
[39:06.480 --> 39:09.680]  those little minions meghan kelly and everybody you're fighting with even
[39:09.680 --> 39:15.040]  rupert murdoch they're not in on the big ball game they do what we tell them
[39:15.040 --> 39:18.320]  we tell them put out anti-family messages and global warming messages they
[39:18.320 --> 39:22.560]  do it we tell them attack you they do it
[39:22.560 --> 39:26.000]  but there's such an awakening happening that that's all going in your
[39:26.000 --> 39:29.440]  favor right now but you're not going to be allowed to have the presidency
[39:29.440 --> 39:34.720]  unless you play ball and so i'll be honest with you
[39:34.720 --> 39:40.320]  this is a very disturbing move
[39:43.040 --> 39:46.640]  but it's one i would have expected and i just need to know does trump know what's
[39:46.640 --> 39:49.200]  happening here
[39:51.520 --> 39:56.160]  that's a question that i know will end up getting to it
[39:56.160 --> 40:00.160]  and the question is if he gets some globalists behind him but still the main
[40:00.160 --> 40:04.000]  global power structure doesn't like trump
[40:04.000 --> 40:08.800]  do you then ask yourself well maybe he's like reagan playing along with him
[40:08.800 --> 40:12.560]  well then they'll just shoot him like they shot reagan
[40:12.560 --> 40:16.160]  but i'm sure not going to support hillary and that's why it's so important
[40:16.160 --> 40:20.640]  to get people elected at the state level who will block the globalist agenda
[40:20.640 --> 40:24.240]  and to educate the public in general but that's the epic moment we've reached
[40:24.240 --> 40:26.560]  right now i'm going to be going over all this and go to the highlights and the
[40:26.560 --> 40:32.960]  rest of it separately i was critical of the bunnies
[40:32.960 --> 40:36.480]  some of the people in the first part of the siege out in southern nevada that
[40:36.480 --> 40:39.680]  we're trying to provocateur things
[40:40.560 --> 40:43.920]  but i supported overall the idea of land rights and people peacefully standing
[40:43.920 --> 40:48.000]  up and not having the feds aim guns at people saying we'll shoot reporters
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.200]  but then i was really critical of what unfolded out in
[40:51.200 --> 40:55.120]  oregon and it's gone the way i thought it would but now
[40:55.120 --> 40:58.960]  even worse they have arrested it's got to be 60 something people now
[40:58.960 --> 41:06.800]  and uh they arrested 12 people in six states yesterday
[41:06.800 --> 41:10.800]  for taking photos of the feds david bundy
[41:10.800 --> 41:13.520]  people like that they're trying to tie it to trump one of them was a
[41:13.520 --> 41:16.400]  head of a veterans group in new hampshire for trump an unofficial
[41:16.400 --> 41:19.600]  group the media's running with that and they're branding it as here are the new
[41:19.600 --> 41:29.600]  american terrorists they were cowboy hats and they have american flex
[41:29.600 --> 41:41.600]  and it was 12 this morning now it's 18 others and died
[41:41.600 --> 41:44.720]  so we're going to be going over that too some in the next hour we've got the
[41:44.720 --> 41:49.520]  northeast intelligence network head joining us and i'll be honest
[41:49.520 --> 41:54.080]  eight nine years ago i would hear
[41:54.080 --> 41:58.480]  doug hagman on coast to coast to haim with george norian i thought he was
[41:58.480 --> 42:00.960]  really smart on some things i thought he was exaggerating or
[42:00.960 --> 42:04.960]  putting out just propaganda on others
[42:07.600 --> 42:10.400]  where he said they're going to flood the u.s with radical jihadists is how to
[42:10.400 --> 42:12.640]  bring in sharia law and they're going to flood europe
[42:12.640 --> 42:16.320]  and obama's really a closet muslim and i have this from the fbi
[42:16.320 --> 42:20.160]  and all the rest of it i know the guy does teach law enforcement group state
[42:20.160 --> 42:23.200]  police even the feds i know he's a respected
[42:23.200 --> 42:26.720]  private detective and law enforcement trainer with just scores of certificates
[42:26.720 --> 42:29.680]  but i just thought that is crazy that's not going to happen i mean i heard him
[42:29.680 --> 42:31.920]  saying it before glenn beck was saying it and i was thinking glenn beck was
[42:31.920 --> 42:36.640]  right about that and i was wrong and they really have done it and uh he really
[42:36.640 --> 42:41.040]  does have these contacts and he's right and he's got a whole bunch of just over
[42:41.040 --> 42:43.920]  the top stuff to talk about and i just can't handle it anymore i mean it's
[42:43.920 --> 42:48.000]  just what type of crazies do we have running this government
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.240]  i have a stack of people beating folks up stabbing them killing people you name
[42:52.240 --> 42:56.400]  it in europe try to enforce syria law on the streets
[42:56.400 --> 42:59.120]  they already banned october fest in a bunch of german cities because the
[42:59.120 --> 43:02.720]  muslims would come out and attack people because they didn't like seeing
[43:02.720 --> 43:07.120]  women with cold beer handing out big mugs i mean can't we have anything
[43:07.120 --> 43:11.520]  liberals you're such filth you hate freedom so much
[43:11.520 --> 43:15.360]  you bring in the weirdest freakiest people to bully everybody and then we
[43:15.360 --> 43:18.080]  have to submit to them so they don't get upset
[43:18.080 --> 43:22.480]  i just it's just it's just crazy and then the feds want to persecute a bunch
[43:22.480 --> 43:25.200]  of ranchers i know there were 50 something families
[43:25.200 --> 43:29.600]  30 in the area you ran them all out you took their grazing rights
[43:29.600 --> 43:36.560]  and i guess one family stood up and so boy didn't you show them
[43:36.560 --> 43:40.720]  the country really is run by people that hate private property hate men hate
[43:40.720 --> 43:44.080]  family they all watch drama shows all those feds that
[43:44.080 --> 43:47.840]  are involved watch the drama shows that mirror what they're supposed to be where
[43:47.840 --> 43:51.120]  women run everything and men are bad and families are bad and
[43:51.120 --> 43:54.720]  they're arresting the patriots because they're all terrorists and
[43:54.720 --> 44:00.800]  it's just such a brainwash narrative i mean can't people see it's all a fraud
[44:00.800 --> 44:05.520]  where they had video packages against trump and graphics and the lights
[44:05.520 --> 44:10.960]  i mean i'm a tv guy okay i took rtf but i've done it for 21 years that's the
[44:10.960 --> 44:14.240]  real school and it's annoying three four hours
[44:14.240 --> 44:19.760]  under these lights they're turned up medium trump was turned up with
[44:19.760 --> 44:23.600]  hot stage lights i could see the color of them they were yellow
[44:23.600 --> 44:29.120]  the others were white light kelly had kelly was perfectly lit
[44:29.120 --> 44:32.480]  like it was a you know 10 million dollar porno scene
[44:32.480 --> 44:35.600]  megan kelly had the best lighting i've ever seen on a woman she looked like some
[44:35.600 --> 44:39.440]  type of angel her eyes look satanic though
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.400]  but i marveled at the femininity of it and how they presented it it was it was
[44:44.400 --> 44:47.760]  don't tell me warren made by an awesome creator making something like that
[44:47.760 --> 44:52.720]  but the brain is rotten the brain is ugly so i'm not attracted to megan kelly
[44:52.720 --> 44:56.880]  but i the way they had her dolled up perfect the whole nine yards it clicked
[44:56.880 --> 45:03.200]  you see her in the wrong light she didn't look it looks like a witch
[45:03.200 --> 45:07.920]  and they had trump under yellow hot lights but you cook an egg on those
[45:07.920 --> 45:11.680]  blasting him and people are wondering why he was squinting and why he was
[45:11.680 --> 45:15.120]  and it's just his people you know he's running his own campaign he thinks he
[45:15.120 --> 45:18.400]  knows everything and donal i wouldn't tell you how to
[45:18.400 --> 45:21.440]  build a building i wouldn't tell you how to you know pick up the most
[45:21.440 --> 45:25.280]  beautiful women or whatever but buddy you've been in tv
[45:25.280 --> 45:28.880]  production yourself and they hit you and hit you hard and you were right not to
[45:28.880 --> 45:33.200]  go to the last one they flamethrowed him
[45:33.200 --> 45:36.880]  but we should pull up some of the footage they flamethrowered him
[45:36.880 --> 45:39.920]  and by the way that's a tactic i was talking to a former nightline producer
[45:39.920 --> 45:43.040]  he said oh yeah we used to get the militias and stuff into be interviewed
[45:43.040 --> 45:46.160]  we'd have the presenter here and we turn the lights up super high power and
[45:46.160 --> 45:49.760]  that's why people would look almost almost white and they were doing it to
[45:49.760 --> 45:57.040]  trump i mean they were basically light boarding him last night
[45:58.240 --> 46:01.840]  that's why cops will turn the lights up real bright you know to get you to break
[46:01.840 --> 46:06.720]  it's a subtle form of uh psychological warfare torture
[46:06.720 --> 46:10.480]  then workers goes a phone book upside the head but it'll do
[46:10.480 --> 46:14.320]  now we're gonna be getting into all that but but
[46:14.320 --> 46:17.440]  gawker i tweeted this last night and gawker has written so much bull about me
[46:17.440 --> 46:20.560]  and you know and the rest of it i mean it's usually a comedy act but
[46:20.560 --> 46:25.920]  gawker got it right uh alex perini
[46:25.920 --> 46:28.880]  donald trump was set up and then it just goes through the whole setup i'm gonna
[46:28.880 --> 46:32.400]  get to that in a moment and these clips but first

[54:44.560 --> 54:54.960]  it was just so incredible 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 what do you think of
[54:54.960 --> 55:01.600]  genridge coming out for trump what do you think of him meeting with the cfr
[55:01.600 --> 55:05.760]  what do you think happens at that level i would have to see what happened when
[55:05.760 --> 55:09.120]  he got an office if he delivered
[55:09.120 --> 55:15.440]  then why are they so scared of him then if they think he'll just sell out
[55:16.480 --> 55:20.640]  see that makes me want to support trump i can't support hillary but
[55:20.640 --> 55:24.640]  at the same time it's all troubling but what would you do at that level when
[55:24.640 --> 55:28.480]  they reach out to you what are you supposed to do
[55:28.480 --> 55:32.720]  i pretty much meet with anybody i've met with i've had the head of the
[55:32.720 --> 55:36.320]  kester group on they thought they'd come on be nice to me invite me up to new
[55:36.320 --> 55:39.760]  york he did during the break harman heard it
[55:39.760 --> 55:43.040]  when i wasn't nice to him on air he said i can i just thought you were smart

[55:46.080 --> 55:49.120]  patty cake with you
[55:49.840 --> 55:55.600]  i'm not selling out to these people because you can't sell out to death
[55:55.600 --> 55:59.520]  you can't sell out to eugenics if my family was getting threatened the
[55:59.520 --> 56:03.440]  public's dumbed down and wouldn't do anything i'd stay out of the way of
[56:03.440 --> 56:06.560]  boss hog i don't have a death wish
[56:06.560 --> 56:10.320]  this isn't boss hog who just wants to run the show
[56:10.320 --> 56:14.000]  they want total control over everything and destroy the human
[56:14.000 --> 56:20.000]  system and replace it with a new one i'm not signing on to that
[56:20.000 --> 56:23.600]  see it's not that i'm mr goody two shoes folks i know
[56:23.600 --> 56:30.320]  who the globalist are they're death you don't make deals with people like
[56:30.320 --> 56:35.040]  that i'm not pigheaded by the way when it comes to
[56:35.040 --> 56:39.920]  compromise even for the greater good and if you can't beat somebody
[56:39.920 --> 56:42.960]  i'm not a fatalist i'm not here to lose i want to win
[56:42.960 --> 56:47.440]  but i'm not selling out the the unborn i'm not promoting devil worship
[56:47.440 --> 56:50.720]  i'm not promoting the end of the family i'm not promoting making people dumb and
[56:50.720 --> 56:53.840]  poor no never never i'm not promoting
[56:53.840 --> 56:57.840]  screwing people just not doing it and if donald trump wants to empower
[56:57.840 --> 57:00.160]  america and the world and not have wars with russia
[57:00.160 --> 57:04.800]  they act like that's a horrible thing i hear a lot of good stuff out of
[57:04.800 --> 57:09.200]  we'll see what happens though it's all very very dangerous it's all
[57:09.200 --> 57:12.880]  this is an unprecedented time we're at the sea change we're at the crossroads
[57:12.880 --> 57:18.960]  we're at the jump point we're at the flash point we're at the event horizon
[57:18.960 --> 57:22.240]  let's go to this two-minute mashup as we get ready to go to break uh this is
[57:22.240 --> 57:26.320]  from the debate all street journals at the spoil down here it is
[57:26.320 --> 57:30.480]  he referred to my hands of this fall something else must be spoiled
[57:30.480 --> 57:35.360]  i guarantee you there's no problem i guarantee it our campaign is the only
[57:35.360 --> 57:39.760]  campaign that over and over again has beaten donald trump to date
[57:39.760 --> 57:43.760]  but he's getting beaten very very badly so where does this come from
[57:43.760 --> 57:46.880]  it's now march madness and we're heading up north
[57:46.880 --> 57:51.840]  to the to the place to my turf okay i have a policy question for you sir
[57:51.840 --> 57:54.560]  let's see if he answers it don't worry about it little marco
[57:54.560 --> 57:58.800]  gentlemen down in florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers
[57:58.800 --> 58:04.000]  people don't want a short-term job they don't want so we will bring people in
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.120]  and we will send the people out but when you have chances to help the
[58:07.120 --> 58:10.400]  american workers you're making your clothes overseas and you're hiring your
[58:10.400 --> 58:13.200]  workers from overseas all right you could resolve this issue very
[58:13.200 --> 58:16.800]  quickly by simply releasing the right there
[58:16.800 --> 58:22.720]  we got a bunch of the clips coming up it's a guest worker program for 90 days
[58:22.720 --> 58:26.880]  that's what all these hotels use because the truth is you can't get the skilled
[58:26.880 --> 58:30.080]  people that know how to run a hotel who are locals who just want to work for
[58:30.080 --> 58:34.000]  90 days because they're college kids it takes years of
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.280]  training these are professionals that do it all over the world and choose the
[58:37.280 --> 58:39.840]  lifestyle again they use the public's ignorance to make
[58:39.840 --> 58:42.800]  trump look like a liar like the hillary thing he didn't support her for
[58:42.800 --> 58:46.320]  president visit gcnlive.com but trump didn't defend
[58:46.320 --> 58:48.640]  himself he just it was his crazy
[58:48.640 --> 58:52.800]  brain force it's completely different try a bottle of it rob do
[58:52.800 --> 58:56.640]  shines us you worked i guess like 20 plus hours
[58:56.640 --> 58:59.600]  tell us what brain force did i've been working all day i took a couple hours
[58:59.600 --> 59:03.120]  off coaching basketball i get in here at 8 30
[59:03.120 --> 59:06.400]  i was kind of run down you know i just didn't feel like i was going to make it
[59:06.400 --> 59:08.640]  and i really want to do a good job on the interview
[59:08.640 --> 59:12.000]  i got my bottle of brain force right there i popped two of them and about 20
[59:12.000 --> 59:15.520]  minutes later it's like bing everything just kind of clears up
[59:15.520 --> 59:19.360]  it's got four and a half stars people really love it read about it find out
[59:19.360 --> 59:23.520]  why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really
[59:23.520 --> 59:26.640]  does have the best organic based systems that
[59:26.640 --> 59:29.680]  will blow your socks off i haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while
[59:29.680 --> 59:32.880]  but i probably could not have done it without brain force i went home about
[59:32.880 --> 59:36.560]  645 this morning uh took three hours of sleep got up took
[59:36.560 --> 59:40.800]  two more brain force and came in you will find brain force and other game
[59:40.800 --> 59:49.120]  changing products at info warslife.com or call 888-253-3139
[59:51.280 --> 59:59.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.520]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:11.920]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:18.960]  that debate was just a dissent into an attempt to
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:25.440]  mug bloodbath donald trump will that backfire on them
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.720]  or did they actually score some points because he didn't defend himself
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:32.240]  on things like funding hillary he gave money to a senate campaign into her
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.680]  charity he's pointed that out before but he backed and gave
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.840]  10 times the money to mint romney that's what those big billionaires do to
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.960]  operate in those states you give political contributions or they come
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.520]  after you he didn't give his old defense that's
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:48.800]  true uh and i'm not attacking trump i'm just
[01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:53.440]  saying the points where he had problems i'm trying to show what happened here
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.400]  but still everybody i talked to people who don't even like trump said yeah
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.280]  they're out to get him that was incredible and then they just showed video
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.120]  package or video package only against him trying to make him look like a
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.400]  liar and then weird stuff about tyranny's now popular
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:11.120]  donald trump likes putin and all he said is i don't want to have war with russia
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.320]  and we could try to make better deals and then what you want a president to do
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:19.040]  and then look at drudge it has the article prickly don rips below belt
[01:01:19.040 --> 01:01:22.640]  jab size matters
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:27.200]  and then they say scientist new york daily news that runs pieces every day
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.480]  against trump say fingers really do match size i mean
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:34.560]  this is what the debate has been turned into by the media
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:39.200]  and then they act like trump making a joke about it he's the bad guy
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.480]  when by the way trump doesn't even have small hands i have on average small
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:47.040]  hands i could tell you that just in my my experience the stereotype is not
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:50.880]  true but whatever i mean i actually have a giant head
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:53.360]  about as big a hat size you have to go to stores actually have
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.640]  almost special hat sizes for my head what does that mean i'm big brain actually
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.760]  does but large cc size a lot of dopamine a lot of
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.080]  chemicals in there a lot of energy also makes for good weapons back in the day
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.920]  but uh i'm just joking folks but look at this
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:13.680]  look at this size matters okay well then let's go there
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.600]  let's show ted cruise i mean we've all seen a booger fall out of somebody's
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:20.160]  nose on tv we've all seen somebody having a piece of
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.160]  spittle on their lip but with him it's a big old juicy
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:28.800]  juicy booger falls out of his nose sits on his lip for a good 15 seconds
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.640]  and then falls the bottom lip and then like he's a little reptoid or something
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:36.480]  lizard the tongue just lovingly like this is actually probably how he eats he's
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:39.520]  from another planet the food comes out of the sinus
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:42.800]  and he expert it he kind of marinades for a minute and then falls
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.480]  let's play it again and then he just lovingly let's roll over tv viewers
[01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:51.440]  on front screen so they can really get a blow up of this and then just the snack
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:55.040]  lovingly sits on the lower lip and then the tongue just
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:58.800]  flicks almost instinctively like a bullfrog is asleep but a
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:03.360]  but a horse flying lands beside just lovingly oh the lip just
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.960]  just i just thought that there's a deliciousness there and i have to say
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:10.800]  he does it very elegantly you know i would feel it there and just brush it
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.600]  off but he he loved it somebody was actually
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:18.560]  probably pointing to him in the state buddy he sees it he goes up snack time
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:23.680]  delicious so delicious so this is what we've come to in america
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:28.720]  can we slow down just the just the part where he delicious is where he
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.400]  the prestige shot the what do they call those the
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:39.840]  the denaro shot uh the shekel shot the euro shot the dollar shot the yin
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:43.680]  shot no there's not the money shot there you go
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:50.480]  ah delicious wait a minute you didn't
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:53.200]  we ought to cut that together with the caddy shack part where they're watching
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.960]  spaulding judge smells nephew he goes just look at spaulding and i
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:00.560]  we're regular pals and then they just fault that you know they're having bets
[01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:06.960]  on will spaulding eat the bugger of course he does so you can place bets
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:11.600]  in vegas will crews eat the next bugger that falls out of his nose onto his lip
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:14.800]  hey when the presidential reality show
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:22.640]  turns into member size male sexual member size
[01:04:22.640 --> 01:04:27.680]  and booger eating i don't ever cover soft more stuff but hey the gates are open
[01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:35.200]  now in my experience small hands
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.600]  small hands actually don't affect things but they do affect magical things
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.480]  because there is kind of a trick question of that
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.760]  see how does well it's like those balloons at the store that are this big
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.840]  but then they get this big so the question is is everybody magical
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.960]  maybe you're magical when you have small hands now this is all for to talk
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.600]  about i'm sorry family show on the stop right there

[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:40.960]  network on was about this khalia situation now he told you that was
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:44.000]  going to be an investigation now they admit that there is a private
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.800]  investigation going on and washington post tried to head it off
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:49.920]  admitting when he died in a secret society
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:53.760]  meeting that was a spinoff of bohemian growth
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.760]  not just a hunting society and i'm not saying it's a bad society he was in
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:02.240]  these are feeder groups these are compartmentalized
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:05.760]  he's got breaking news on the supreme court issue and he has a lot of sources
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:11.520]  now we have a lot of sources too kind of like i had uh
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:15.440]  roger stone former head of trump's campaign is a good friend of 40 plus
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.680]  years on and i said yeah i talked to vinter the other
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:21.120]  days coming on friday he says he really likes donald trump's played golf with
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.920]  him and friends with him for 20 plus years he's not going to run against him
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.000]  but if it's rubio he is and stone goes yeah i talked to him
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.720]  yesterday he wants me to be his campaign head if he runs that's
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:33.840]  absolutely true so see i mean i'm making phone calls i'm getting
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.240]  inside baseball but i also know how to verify people are accurate
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:42.000]  i would hear dug hagman probably eight nine years ago or longer on coast to coast
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:45.360]  am and i said this last time i'm gonna just say it now and he would say
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:48.160]  our sources in the federal government say they plan to flood europe the united
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.920]  states with radical muslims to use the threat as a way to take our freedoms
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:54.560]  and they're going to allow surreal ought to be taught in schools
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:58.480]  and what i would just go that is ridiculous a lot of what he said i knew
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.960]  was true as i was confused i liked him on the radio
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.440]  learned some stuff knew a lot of it was true but then he would say stuff that i
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:06.560]  was just like you know our elite aren't that crazy
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.720]  well then blend back picked it up a bunch of the people picked it up
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:15.200]  and it's turned out it's true so that's why i like to get him on we should get
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:19.840]  him on more often i had been on by six months or so but
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:22.880]  dug hagman joins us to talk about what he thinks about scalia
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:26.560]  or what's going on with the election was view on trump
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.920]  the black lives matter i mean again he was first started coming on
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.960]  five years ago on my show once i figured out that okay he knows what he's talking
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:35.200]  about
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.800]  he said they're gonna fund black nationalist movements to kill police
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:43.840]  and try to start a civil war that was before it was known soros was even
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:48.080]  funding it before it started so i like to hit the horn of people
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.880]  you go back to those interviews who do know what they're talking about so i
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:54.480]  know the rest of the inside baseball from dug
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:59.600]  hagman and what's happening currently so let's just do five minutes on scalia
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.960]  and on the new supreme court info he has and let's move into
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:06.480]  all those other subjects that i just went into dug great to have you back i
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.960]  tell you things are so exciting so scary now
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:15.040]  i can't even believe newt gendres is saying secret societies run everything
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:18.720]  on fox news and they're i mean everything we've talked about is just now
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:21.840]  coming out i guess we really are run by crazy
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:25.280]  people who just want to destroy america and christianity i mean it's what you
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:29.440]  said it is the plan what are your federal contacts telling you
[01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:34.000]  and state police contacts right now about what's happening
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.800]  with scalia where that's all going yeah always thanks for having me a couple of
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.920]  things with respect to scalia that investigation his
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:45.760]  death very mysterious indeed uh john poindexter
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.080]  once people understand who he is big obama donor all that but investigations
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:54.720]  101 um him passing away or dying or being murdered
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.160]  whatever it's almost irrelevant but at the ranch
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.440]  and the fact that the most basic of investigative uh
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:05.920]  policies were not followed that in and of itself is really problematic the
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.960]  fact that there was no uh official their
[01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:12.880]  present to declare him dead or to sign off on a death certificate
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:15.840]  the fact that he was embalmed before of course
[01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.960]  his um of the family physician has spoken with the person who signed off
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.480]  cinderella uh where uh there last name is cinderella the judge uh there the
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:31.040]  fact that uh uh he was embalmed before the conversation between cinderella and
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:34.400]  and uh the uh judges personal care physician
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.400]  took place is obviously problematic but the bottom line here
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:43.760]  is scalia is out of the way and now we've got a danger to our constitution
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:47.680]  i've got a ton of information about the um about the actual
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:54.080]  the scene itself and about the uh uh events before during and after but uh
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:58.480]  alex what i want to tell you and i'm here my sources are telling me this
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:02.640]  and this is kind of the first time i'm going public uh with this
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:07.760]  in this platform there will be between now and election
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:14.000]  another supreme court vacancy okay now before anyone says yells at me pelican
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.560]  brief it doesn't have to be a death it could be a
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:19.680]  resignation but the information i'm getting is i guarantee there'll be one
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.680]  more uh supreme court vacancy and that is to solidify
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:27.920]  the supreme court uh on behalf of obama where he can
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:32.640]  nominate uh select and and and have the senate confirm
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.480]  two not just one but two nominees during his tenure to
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:40.560]  absolutely solidify the progressive marx's agenda
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:44.400]  of this cabal that's in power now whether that happens according to the
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:47.440]  timeline well this is what's being told to me i'm just
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:50.160]  relaying the information are they saying who it is
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:54.960]  ginsberg that's you know not directly saying who it is but
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:14:58.640]  by everything i've been able to really kind of get out of the people yeah
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.720]  ginsberg appears where she's going to retire for health reasons now
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:06.880]  if that doesn't happen then there may have to go to plan b and i'm not
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:10.720]  exactly sure what plan b is but watch for that okay well you told me five
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:15.360]  years ago they're worried about obama wants to start a race war
[01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.200]  to bring in a civil emergency we've seen him try that a bunch
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.200]  uh you you you talk about the plan to flood us with sharia law
[01:15:23.200 --> 01:15:26.320]  and now i've got stacks of news today where it's happening in public schools
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:29.280]  everywhere they're teaching it they're making kids put on hot jobs
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:32.560]  they're they're making them praise all this is even non-muslim teachers
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:36.400]  this is actually common core what is all of this about on
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:41.520]  on that front well it's it's boy everything works like a
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:45.280]  a uh all of these are cogs in a larger machine
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:48.720]  the invasion the alien invasion into this country is to is to
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:53.920]  is to rip the moral and spiritual and cultural fabric of our country of course
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.680]  that's what they showed at the uh the academy awards is they showed the tower
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:00.880]  of babel the whole time in the background i mean
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.640]  what are they telling us well they're in charge
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:07.760]  and they're they're they're laughing at us see that that's what people don't
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:10.800]  understand they're showing this stuff and people are looking at it and saying
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.120]  well you know it's just art it's entertainment it's
[01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:16.240]  it's whatever but the fact of the matter is they're telling us what they're
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:19.360]  going to do before they do it and they're laughing at us because no one's
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:23.200]  getting it no one's understanding it or at least very few are you are
[01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:26.640]  your audience is but but the majority of people are just you know hey when we
[01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.640]  have um really 32 percent of of american people
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:35.680]  never hearing the don't even know who scalia was for example in a recent poll
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:38.560]  we've got a problem in this country obviously and you you know
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.360]  and you've proven that many times they don't know what planet they're on so so
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.600]  i'm asking a lot of questions here and this is
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.200]  really important what's the intel from all your great sources
[01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.480]  what's the state of the republic right now what are the big points we need to go
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.920]  over here today okay great push right now to change the
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:58.160]  the uh the complexion of the judiciary uh the fact is if they could
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:02.640]  perhaps get loretta lynch in as a potential candidate for the supreme
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:07.440]  court that'll throw the doj into some little bit of chaos there
[01:17:07.440 --> 01:17:11.600]  to take away from the hillary clinton indictment possibility
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:15.920]  there's a war right now going on inside the fbi according to my fbi source
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.400]  saying that if she doesn't get indicted there's a lot of good people that they're
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:23.600]  going to lose a lot of good people um uh there's a push for additional racial
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.400]  riots this summer but going for broke that is in other words what we saw
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.240]  back in uh the 2011 that was rest rehearsal
[01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.680]  absolutely uh so we've got that the economy uh
[01:17:35.680 --> 01:17:39.760]  we we our economy is just it's in a crap storm i mean
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:44.080]  however uh what will help the economy well we need a war
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:48.400]  we've got a ready-made war right now in in syria and i gotta tell you right now
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:52.080]  syria is uh it's my belief that syria will be
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:56.160]  uh well death race Damascus the road to Damascus is the road to world war three
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.080]  and despite ukraine despite the south sea uh chinese islands syria is where we
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:03.760]  need to keep our attention to where nato is being pitted against russia by
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.960]  this global scabal you pointed you pointed this out
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:11.600]  um in your investigations years ago so it's all coming to pass right now it's
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:14.560]  crunch time so to speak what else are your federal
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.600]  sources saying about the war going on in the government because they now admit
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.880]  that war you talked about many years ago is now out in the open the purging of
[01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:23.440]  the military uh i've never seen the military more
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:27.280]  awake it's stunning how great they are and they really get it does that
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:30.480]  concern the globalists or are they just so arrogant they don't understand that
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:34.000]  basically everybody in special ops is awake most the general unless that are
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.400]  awake the non-commissioned officers are awake i mean that's gotta be a major
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.880]  ace in the hole for freedom well well there's a couple a couple of dynamics
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:46.560]  going on here of course there's infighting among the globalists because
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:50.320]  uh you've got the old-time globalists the new globalists who want to upstage the
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:54.880]  old-time globalist so then you've got the other aspect of this which is the
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:59.600]  interestingly enough it's the uh the generation of the iphone's and ipads the
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.080]  the generation with the people who understand how to manipulate
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:08.000]  the electrons so to speak so you've got this war going on
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.040]  using social media which is really at the forefront
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:15.040]  you're seeing uh sensor censorship in europe now
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:19.280]  coming to america with social media any talk against the globalists or any talk
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.040]  against immigration for example we're seeing
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.080]  unprecedented return of nazi-level censorship and our media says it's great
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:30.720]  telling you they're getting ready to push that here which is now begun
[01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:34.080]  conservatives and libertarians are being purged everywhere
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:38.160]  exactly so you've got uh what we're looking at and again you've done so
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.360]  well to point this out we've got war on multiple fronts we've got war
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:45.760]  in the social media we've got war within the various governmental departments
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:49.600]  dhs however is the umbrella organization that's attempting to tie everything
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:53.120]  together and kind of ahead of that or on top of
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:57.680]  that is this this organization of of a few

[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:47.680]  and yeah I worry about my children but I understand that
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.520]  past generations have gone through these times as well
[01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.840]  and there have been a lot of different elites throughout history a lot of them
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:58.160]  just wanted to conquer and run things and a lot of times put in aqueducts
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:01.840]  and you know and actually built societies up
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:05.040]  but still the existing civilization wouldn't want to have their culture
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:08.560]  taken over they had a right to fight back the globalists are
[01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:11.440]  ending humanity as we know it in their own words they call it the final
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:15.120]  revolution and if you want to know who the quote liberals
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:18.320]  are the leading edge of the societal takeover they're the
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:21.920]  change-agent arm the republicans are owned by the same people at the top
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:25.360]  you're seeing that with trump right now
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:29.360]  they want to end the family in the process make us these
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.640]  atomized creatures like George Arwell talked about
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:37.040]  children being taken like you take eggs from a hen like North Korea
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:41.280]  you go but why would they want a horrible civilization like that
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:45.840]  because that's what evil people hunger after and the fact that the so-called

[01:26:16.560 --> 01:26:19.680]  arrested charged and he was talking about the group
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:24.000]  hagman was above homeland security they set up on my security to control the
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.840]  other agencies try to make sure they follow these
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.520]  unconstitutional orders and if the fbi won't go out and arrest all the
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:33.280]  patriots they'll just create a new division and that's what they're doing
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.520]  folks and you got to understand they really hate us they call us better
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:40.560]  cleaners dug this is short segment long segment coming up hagman and
[01:26:40.560 --> 01:26:43.280]  hagman dot com folks want to find out more
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:46.400]  i just want the listeners to realize this is for all the marbles

[01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:59.280]  we don't have a choice do you get where i'm going
[01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:02.640]  absolutely and you know you you point out so many great
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:07.120]  points you know you did a video here not to a couple of days ago i believe it
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:10.880]  was about the really the dark horse of the new world order that being
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:14.480]  technocracy and i think people if people really understood
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:18.640]  the bigger picture here what's going on we're being forced like cattle
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.800]  into this this new old world order so to speak
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.760]  and what you're talking about what you just brought up the articles that you
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:30.320]  have right there you the focus that what you're focused on is really
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:33.760]  the the key here where i think people need to understand that the picture is a
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:36.480]  lot bigger how did you know first that they really
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:40.000]  plan to bring in radical jihadis and people and teach it in schools what
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:45.520]  what is the sick freak plan there well and you know look i i'm i'm not the
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:49.360]  smartest bar you know not the brightest bulb in the bunch so i i've had
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:53.040]  some good sources tell me okay this is what they're going to do
[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:56.960]  their ultimate objective uh is to is to criminalize
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:00.400]  the current forms of the three monotheistic religions here in the in
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:04.240]  the united states jude Judaism Christianity and islam if you can
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:08.080]  believe that uh distill all three religions monotheistic
[01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:11.520]  religions to create a state religion that's compatible where where all
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:15.200]  religions are compatible with one another all the u n plans so get us
[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.000]  all together bring in radicals have us fight and kill each other and then
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.040]  take all our rights to create safety that's right
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:24.400]  and yes in order to do that they've got to rip down the existing
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:27.760]  infrastructure in order to create a new one just like the phoenix and as you've
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:31.360]  gone through so yeah but you say you're not the smartest bulb i mean you you
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:34.560]  just crystallized that better than i ever could and that is the plan now is
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:37.360]  that what your federal sources told you because you were saying this eight nine
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:40.400]  years ago yeah yeah exactly that that's what they were
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:43.760]  saying i was having a hard time really understanding what the big plan was i
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:46.800]  was so focused on these small skirmishes or these
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:49.760]  individual disparate events that i wasn't seeing the big picture
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:52.960]  in what you've done is to crystallize the big picture and others
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:56.880]  when you want you see the big picture and understand how one event works in
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:01.600]  tandem with there's no going back that's it and so
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:05.520]  for example the war in syria is connected to the uh the illegal immigration
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.160]  of aliens here in the united states which is connected to the
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:11.760]  criminalization of free speech which is connected to the second amendment
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:15.600]  and people who stand in the way like scalia uh the first and second amendment
[01:29:15.600 --> 01:29:19.840]  i mean everything is connected and once you see that that that the wheels
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:24.000]  in motion those little cogs the moving parts and you can see a unity of
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:27.920]  agenda it's the same rhetoric to bring in the jihadis here as it is in europe
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:31.200]  you can see the unified power hagman and hagman dot com folks you want to

[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:20.640]  given his affiliation with bohemian grove although he could also be speaking
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:24.960]  of the skull and bones club which is notorious for its initiation rituals
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:29.280]  so far trump has played the role of outsider and people are loving him for
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:33.440]  it but he has held private briefings with some secret society types like

[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:27.600]  who's a law enforcement specialist private detective
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:31.520]  holds a whole bunch of certificates and areas you
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:34.480]  and most of us don't even know about the point is he's an expert
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:38.000]  he consults with the FBI state police in multiple states
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.040]  he's a talk show host on his own right if you just tuned in I'd hear him on
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:44.240]  coast to coast AM eight nine years ago I think this guy knows what he's talking
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:47.520]  about on a lot of stuff but he's saying they're going to bring in
[01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:50.560]  all these radical Muslims in the Europe and the US and flood us and bring in
[01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:53.840]  sharia law and he's one of the first I ever heard saying this he had it from
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:57.520]  sources in the government and then that stuff started coming true
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:02.400]  but before that came true he was saying they're going to
[01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:05.840]  for my sources create race war in the country and stir everything up when
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:08.640]  Obama gets in he's not going to be a unifier and they're going to try to bring
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:11.680]  in federal control off the backs of that and they're going to have a big
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:15.040]  anti-police movement and that's going to build towards the end of a second term
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.760]  this is like eight years ago
[01:37:17.760 --> 01:37:22.160]  and now it's happening so that's why I listen to him because his sources
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:25.680]  really know what's going on I want to get to the election and phone calls here
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:29.200]  with you but but but I've been so busy I haven't really been following what you
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:33.040]  said about Trump that attempted assassination politically last night
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:37.600]  the the train wreck the informational attack videos
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.720]  I mean they threw everything at him including the kitchen sink
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:45.680]  they had the lights all turned up in his face uh they were all piled on against
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:49.440]  him why is the power structure so scared of
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:52.640]  Donald Trump or do you disagree with that what do you think's happening mr
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.640]  Hagman no and Alex I think you're exactly right I
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:59.680]  watched your first hour um and I totally agree with your
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:04.160]  assessment of things uh look uh Trump is saying everything
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:07.120]  that Americans want to hear or at least the most
[01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:12.480]  rational sensible Americans the uh Trump is actually out there saying what we
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:16.000]  what we want to hear now that's like that's good news and bad news obviously
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.600]  it's bad news as far as the state of the country is concerned
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:23.840]  good news because we have ostensibly a guy in there that wants to fix things and
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:28.560]  of course the establishment republicans want to uh want to take him out
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:31.440]  they don't want to deal with him and they're gonna they're gonna pull every dirty trick
[01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:35.680]  in the book to get him off of the ballot or or make sure he doesn't get on the
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:38.000]  ballot and that's that's taking place right now
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.840]  I have a guy within the political system who is telling me that
[01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:46.080]  through some uh delegate the super delegate delegate trickery they can
[01:38:46.080 --> 01:38:49.120]  they can knock him off of a couple of key states the
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:53.840]  every delegate takes all or a winner takes all states
[01:38:53.840 --> 01:38:56.640]  I'm not sure exactly sure how that works but they're gonna try to pull that
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:39:00.960]  they're gonna try to pull other people into the race of course they've got a
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:04.800]  package uh already ready to be deployed against
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:10.240]  Donald Trump in terms of his past his bankruptcies his mob connection so
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:14.560]  this is yet to come out at least in the form that they intend are your sources
[01:39:14.560 --> 01:39:17.360]  saying anything about mob connections being real I mean we obviously know
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:21.920]  there's women he doesn't lie about that uh I mean are your sources saying any of
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.800]  this could be damaging or is it all just fluff
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:29.200]  well the my source in particularly the one I've been listening to about
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:33.680]  Donald Trump is the perception is reality it doesn't matter real not real
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:37.120]  it doesn't matter as long as we can make it appear that it's real
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:40.400]  as far as the mob connections that are concerned uh
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:43.760]  according to again the my source you know not really you're going to run into
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:46.800]  different business people who have connections to connect to other people
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:51.520]  and you know you're you're always a degree or two away from somebody that
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:54.400]  that you're not doing business in new jersey and
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:57.200]  new york without you're not building buildings without running into some of
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:01.520]  the wise guys that's correct so the the big thing to
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:05.600]  watch here is the Carl Roe v in apparatus at work here I
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:08.880]  believe and that is and this is what I think
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:12.720]  Alice people really don't understand is we think that there's a two-party
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:16.000]  system you're very good at at breaking this down as a one-party system and it's
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:18.240]  the globalist we're not a part of that party
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:21.840]  it's their party we're not invited but the fact of the matter is they'd rather
[01:40:21.840 --> 01:40:24.960]  take out trump and have hillary and then they would
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:28.640]  have trump in and reunite and the republican leadership has said that
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:32.240]  Mitch McConnell and others what arrogant creatures to defy the will of the
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:35.200]  people it shows how disconnected they are
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:38.800]  and exactly and and trump whether he's you know
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:42.080]  and I like to think as hard as is true and he's serious
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:45.760]  and whether he can do this is another thing or not but but uh the trump gets
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:48.640]  in there of course there's a lot of people who are going to lose their
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:51.680]  jobs and potentially face indictment if that's even
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:54.880]  possible and of course so that's why they're fighting so hard is
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:56.800]  they're worried they could all be going to jail
[01:40:56.800 --> 01:41:00.880]  like hillary and he says if he gets in he's gonna try to get her indicted
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:04.160]  right and we have to watch the hillary situation again because
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:08.800]  uh the the immunity granted to that brian pagliano
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:14.000]  does suggest at least in my experience that either a grand jury has been
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:17.840]  convened or they are going to be convening a grand jury
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:21.440]  whether or not that gets out of the grand jury venue
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:24.640]  well that remains to be seen but the fact is they can cause a lot of
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:27.840]  well there's some leverage there i guess is what i'm saying so we need to
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:31.520]  really take a look at that in terms of hillary but
[01:41:31.520 --> 01:41:34.640]  for some reason well i think for the obvious reasons
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:39.040]  they want hillary and they want her in in the position of power and i'm talking
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:42.640]  about the republicans the gang of a part of the part of the gang of eight
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:45.920]  uh who are ceding their power to the executive branch
[01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:49.840]  which is just absolutely oh yeah we saw miss mcconnell try to sneak a defense
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:53.360]  bill through that literally makes the president a dictator in the senate's own
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:57.440]  words that's right and they're not doing this as some might say for
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:00.560]  the next future republican or conservative president they're doing this
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:04.240]  right now for their current power grab let me ask you this because what you've
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.200]  said about the feds the military all again that all came out from your sources
[01:42:07.200 --> 01:42:09.840]  i know you have a lot of them because you're there on the east coast
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:14.160]  and they've been working law enforcement for 40 years
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:17.280]  the military is just so awake i talk about this constantly because it's such
[01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:20.400]  good news i mean whether it's green berets or current
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:25.760]  delta force or navy seals or even officers up to full bird
[01:42:25.760 --> 01:42:28.960]  kernel level they go look we all know about the takeover we know about all
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.280]  the plans we understand you're dead right we've been
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:34.400]  occupied they've done the same thing to europe
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:37.040]  you know we're just waiting till they give an order that goes too far and i
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:39.120]  mean this is universal this isn't them telling me
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:42.400]  two-sided stuff to you know setting me i mean this is for real
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:46.400]  people are freaked out but separately though i see feds though
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:49.920]  that seem to really want to go out to the patriots they're leftist they hate us
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:54.000]  what percentage of the feds just dead reckoning really are anti-american and
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.120]  hate us or or are there a lot of feds because i've seen
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:59.920]  some of this myself who really are genuinely upset
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:03.680]  genuinely concerned uh as i've had a country on the street some of them
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:06.560]  actually senior i'll look them up later and you know they are on tv and stuff
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:10.400]  a lot of them have time to contact and contact me you know high level
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:14.800]  people in the treasury department you name it uh fbi i just i just can't mess
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:19.600]  with it i just stay out of it all uh but but at the same time
[01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.880]  they claim that that that they know what's going on too and aren't going
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:26.240]  along with it show how big is that internal fight and how many are black
[01:43:26.240 --> 01:43:29.520]  hats versus white hats uh great question eight years
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:32.480]  ago the numbers would have been reversed when i'm about to tell you but right
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:36.960]  now 30 percent are the old school uh stick by the constitution look let's
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.080]  let's uh stand by the american people 70 percent
[01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:44.160]  uh are not and so obama has packed his people in there
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:47.760]  yeah very very much so and that's so unfortunate
[01:43:47.760 --> 01:43:51.120]  what's happening and we're losing a lot of great people a lot of the people
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:54.560]  that that uh that i went to school with for example and in our in law
[01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:57.120]  enforcement who are just retiring and saying
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:01.360]  we keep you know we can't fight this leviathan but there's this uh yeah cancer
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:04.560]  that's growing within each individual federal organization
[01:44:04.560 --> 01:44:07.840]  and what what they're doing very quickly here is they're they're uh
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:11.840]  militarizing the local municipal police forces as well
[01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:16.480]  in saturating the ranks of the local police departments with these
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:20.800]  military-style people and equipment obviously the year report on but
[01:44:20.800 --> 01:44:25.840]  this is actually um um being done in with more with more uh
[01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:30.560]  well in earnest now and there's a push on now to get to make sure as much as
[01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:34.720]  this is done before the end of obama's
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:40.400]  supposed 10 years up well all i know is it is historical what's
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:45.280]  happening it is super creepy and i've seen it backfire with local
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:48.400]  police all over the country though when they call them in and actually bad
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:53.360]  mouth towards washington veterans they say veterans are your new enemy uh
[01:44:53.360 --> 01:44:56.960]  you're gonna have a war with them that seems to really kind of wake people up
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:00.320]  except as you said they're doing special acceleration of
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:04.640]  politico police and bureaucrats where i've been out to national parks and
[01:45:04.640 --> 01:45:08.800]  stuff and see arm park rangers now that literally act like social justice
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:11.440]  warriors and literally come and get in everyone's
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:15.760]  face and treat everyone like we're in boot camp or something and they've been
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:18.880]  told it's come out in the training manuals break their will show them you're
[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:22.000]  the boss don't these people to read history books
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:25.040]  don't they know they're being set up to be the talitarians i mean don't they
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:27.200]  understand they're being set up to be bad guys
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:31.360]  no and there it is right there we are being subjected to
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:34.400]  revisionist history it's interesting because if you pick up a
[01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:37.520]  a government textbook or a textbook about government
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:43.200]  from the we'll say the 29 30 31 in that 19 you know
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:46.880]  early in the 20th century textbook it would compare it to today
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:50.960]  there's a lot that has been revised and removed especially about constitutional
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:55.040]  issues so we are actually seeing the second and
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:01.440]  third generation of of men and women in police in the police
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:04.240]  force who don't really understand unless they've taken
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:09.440]  advanced courses in in the specific to the constitution by
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:13.120]  non ivy league non leftist universities they don't understand
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:16.800]  the the constitution well also i run into a lot of them and they're crazed
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:20.160]  looking i mean they look like they're ready for a war
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:25.840]  i mean like like that bravada is all dressed up and nowhere to go
[01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:31.040]  historically i don't think they realize what they're getting into here
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:35.520]  if this thing actually kicks off no you're right you're exactly right
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:39.920]  and i think a percentage of those you know a percentage of the 70 percent may
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:43.680]  in fact when when really when it goes real for example
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:47.120]  uh may understand look i've got to protect my family and and then break away
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:50.720]  but but there's a hard line in there of people that
[01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:54.960]  uh i cannot believe in and and again the per my contact within the
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:59.680]  within one of the federal agencies said you just can't believe the mentality
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:02.320]  of these new recruits and these people that have been
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:06.000]  that are in there embedded within the agencies they don't care
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:09.280]  if they were told to go arrest our grandmother or mother they would do
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:12.480]  that in a heartbeat as opposed to thinking it through
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:15.360]  so they don't understand in free society and the military and everything
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:19.440]  it's all about not following legal orders i loved it yeah that you
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:22.880]  i loved watching hayden go we wouldn't follow trump's orders because we don't
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:25.760]  do unconstitutional things when they're the ones that got them to all do stuff
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:30.640]  that was wrong exactly and and how do you even
[01:47:30.640 --> 01:47:34.640]  there's nothing that could be said coherently about the policies that we
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:38.800]  were seeing uh being employed and again i go back open the border bringing the
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:41.120]  illegals persecute the patriots we're going to get to more of that
[01:47:41.120 --> 01:47:44.320]  with our guest doug hagman i want to go to your calls john brian
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:47.120]  ken mark james sorry for making you hold so long but i want you to talk about
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:50.320]  what you saw in the debate last night and our guests can comment on that
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:54.560]  uh brian and georgia you're on the air worldwide what do you think
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:59.680]  hey alex uh my wife and i are also delegates for the georgia republican
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:03.200]  party and uh more about that in a minute but i wanted to
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:07.040]  talk to you about uh did you hear lou dobs yesterday
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:12.640]  i mean he went on a rant about the republican insiders that was just
[01:48:12.640 --> 01:48:17.360]  it you know the only way i can describe it is it it was a miraculous
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:20.800]  uh i didn't see a what was the name of it we'll pull it up lou uh
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:24.720]  lou dobs talks about republican insiders let me go to youtube
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:28.240]  yeah yeah lou dobs uh it was on his show yesterday
[01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:32.000]  fox business okay we'll look it up it's business and
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.400]  i mean it it was just incredible well lou dobs has been on he's a listener fox
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:38.320]  won't let him come on but he's almost a daily
[01:48:38.320 --> 01:48:43.920]  listener he is a patriot but as far as uh being a delegate is
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:46.720]  concerned what we really need to have to do
[01:48:46.720 --> 01:48:52.960]  um is to make sure starting at the uh at the county level and in the state
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:57.360]  level is to make sure that no elected official gets to go to the
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:01.120]  to the national convention if we make sure that no elected official gets to
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:04.160]  go to the national that's right don't let them come in and boss you around
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:07.600]  and take over the delegate the super delegate places you go you be delegates
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:10.400]  learn how it works it varies from area to area what did you think about the
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:15.040]  debate last night i thought it was incredible um
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:18.720]  you know i i think no matter what they tried to throw at trump
[01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:22.160]  he's going to come out of it great i also think that uh
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:25.280]  mit romney shot himself in the foot and they're going to try to get
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:30.160]  paul ryan to go in yep i think paul ryan's in the wings as well thank you
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:32.480]  uh let's go ahead and talk to jonah wyoming john what did you think about
[01:49:32.480 --> 01:49:36.960]  last night hi elix uh i saw the debate myself now the
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:40.320]  two things that concern me and oh by the way after this i'm going to give you
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:44.080]  some good news on how trump can destroy hillary's
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:47.600]  campaign as well as the bush crime family
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:51.600]  now the one thing that bothered me on the debate is that trump mentioned
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:56.240]  richard haas who is of course the president of the cfr i talked about
[01:49:56.240 --> 01:50:00.240]  that he met with him there's an article on info wars dot com yes right
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:06.160]  and then of course uh newt gingrich is a decades long member of the cfr now for
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:10.960]  the good news here's how he can destroy hillary clinton's campaign
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:14.880]  first of all when bill clinton in 1994 was president
[01:50:14.880 --> 01:50:20.960]  he allowed westinghouse to sell two nuclear reactors to north korea from
[01:50:20.960 --> 01:50:24.480]  which that they used to build nukes that's right he's got her hillary gave the
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:29.440]  nukes to kim jong-un he'll destroy her it's true i forgot about those i covered
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:32.640]  at the time and they helped transfer the uh
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:37.680]  merve technology and the reentry uh technology but also the booster technology
[01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:41.920]  of laurel and hughes the chai comms great point again always selling us out i

[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:19.040]  don't do it kid don't don't don't don't don't
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:29.040]  there you go
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:35.040]  so i don't like to do a bunch of comedy stuff here or get into gross humor but
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:39.920]  rubio who is is important bubble parties and then his best buddies arrested
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:42.960]  you know arrested with gay porn production companies and they're
[01:54:42.960 --> 01:54:47.280]  arrested outside bathrooms and the issue is blackmail
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:50.880]  and then you've got him talking about
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:55.280]  trumps manhood what is going on with this i mean this
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:58.080]  this is like a train wreck dug what do you think is happening we're gonna go
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:02.560]  back to calls quickly i mean it's a reflection of the
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:07.840]  to me it's a reflection of of our society of the degradation of our society
[01:55:07.840 --> 01:55:10.880]  i mean i mean you know when we start comparing hands okay
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:14.880]  what is that it goes back to boxers or briefs back
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.320]  days of what clinton and it it's just a breath
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:23.680]  rest of slide down this moral morale that's being implemented through the
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:27.680]  tavastaki in mentality you know that's that's in play today
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:32.960]  and it's it's uh it's getting the majority of Americans to focus on the
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:37.600]  shiny trinkets as opposed to what's really important in life
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:41.760]  it's uh in addition to being sophomore humor and
[01:55:41.760 --> 01:55:47.200]  gross and and really just outside the bounds of decency
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:52.400]  well i mean that's just it is what it is it's unfortunate and it's sad
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:55.520]  but uh absolutely i want to talk to you in the next segment about the bundy
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:55:58.960]  situation and that's escalating when more arrests around the country and
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:02.560]  arresting members of the press who i wouldn't really say we're really
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:05.680]  pressed because i followed it but they're using that mantle
[01:56:05.680 --> 01:56:08.720]  it's dangerous because then that can be extended to all the press
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:12.000]  and i think it's wrong uh that they're throwing the book at some of these
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:15.680]  people that clearly aren't a danger some of them might need to be in a mental
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:19.440]  institution for a while but uh again this is a very dangerous
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:22.960]  situation and it's escalating very very fast and they're torturing these
[01:56:22.960 --> 01:56:26.240]  people in solitary confinement we're going to get to that but right now let's
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:29.760]  go to the next caller who has been holding the longest
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:33.360]  canon wyoming thanks for holding you're on the air go ahead
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:37.040]  hello alex how you doing good brother go ahead
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:41.840]  yeah i'm a i'm a teaching from the uh school system here and i'm in the
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:44.800]  social studies class we've been listening to you all morning with my
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:47.520]  students we've been following the debate and
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:51.280]  everything here we saw the debate last night
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:55.680]  trump was being trumped on by all of the people even make ryan
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:57:01.680]  i think that uh they're scared of the establishment being overthrown and
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:05.760]  it's uh an example of what i've been doing i'm an x
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:11.200]  submarine sailor and i've known about the establishment takeover for 40 years
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:15.280]  um i've started a project project here in wyoming
[01:57:15.280 --> 01:57:18.880]  that uh i have been blocked by the establishment
[01:57:18.880 --> 01:57:22.320]  in creating jobs using agricultural techniques
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:30.320]  i'm an xf ffa student and uh i have put in project to the fda
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:33.680]  and they have blocked it every year for 25 years
[01:57:33.680 --> 01:57:37.200]  so the establishment has really been working on us out here in main street
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:40.400]  oh yeah they don't want people to know basic agriculture they want that phased
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:43.600]  out and only big agro it's part of the domestication process but it's great
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:46.800]  to have a teacher like you actually you know breaking down what's happening
[01:57:46.800 --> 01:57:49.920]  what do your students uh think about the debates and what they're
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:53.680]  seeing unfold well you know it's kind of decisive
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:57.680]  some of the people like uh trump most of the most of the students like
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:02.000]  trump but they're kind of afraid of his uh some of his rhetoric
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:05.600]  but they do believe that he's a patriot same as i do

[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:18.560]  we are on the march the empire is on the run
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:24.080]  alex jones and the gcn radio network. Doug Hatch was our guest final segment
[02:00:24.080 --> 02:00:28.160]  Jesse Ventura coming up to talk election 2016 will continue with your calls
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:31.600]  amen bundy says jail most difficult thing i've ever done
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:35.360]  finally after months in there he's talked to the Oregonian
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:39.120]  he's a solitary confinement no clocks no windows there's not no time of day it
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:43.440]  is doesn't deserve to be in that obviously
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:47.760]  it is political torture so just because the bundies i think did some silly
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:52.160]  things and romanticized all this and had a few
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:55.760]  infiltrators come in provocateur now they've arrested 16 more people
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:01:00.000]  yesterday that's over 60 people total and i've read some of these indictments
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.320]  it's like saying that clavin bundy was brandishing guns and stuff and then
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:08.080]  they say at the standoff with the feds and they
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:11.520]  marked the day where the feds backed off
[02:01:11.520 --> 02:01:14.880]  he was back miles away and didn't even have a gun
[02:01:14.880 --> 02:01:18.160]  so they're lying and they're just waiting till they i guess give them
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:21.840]  deprivation from any human contact long enough till they'll say
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:25.440]  whatever they want so they can start a new war on everybody's property out west
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:28.160]  what's left of it and they're already grabbing private property that's been
[02:01:28.160 --> 02:01:31.280]  held for hundreds of years and people's hands in texas
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:35.600]  feds are just showing up saying we're taking it we got automatic weapons so
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:39.680]  uh it's just the way it goes so your take on that Doug this seems like a real
[02:01:39.680 --> 02:01:43.760]  dangerous escalation where a lot of these people are innocent
[02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:49.680]  some of them other ones act unstable uh but uh i have seen very few people
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:52.800]  you know say we're ready to die we're ready to kill people i've seen a few of
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:56.080]  them say that so maybe out of 60 and i've been following this maybe two or
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:58.960]  three did actually make these statements but
[02:01:58.960 --> 02:02:01.840]  my god black lives matter make statements like that constantly in all these
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:06.080]  other groups i guess there's just a hatred of patriots
[02:02:06.080 --> 02:02:10.560]  oh yeah yeah if you if you carry a gun a bible
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:14.240]  and an attitude uh favorable to the constitution then you're
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:19.440]  your enemy number one better cleaner exactly but you know it's it's funny i
[02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:24.240]  really think the the bundy situation the uh uh what happened in
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:26.880]  oregon and then what happened uh you know before
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:30.160]  and the these arrests it's my understanding these arrests are stemming
[02:02:30.160 --> 02:02:35.120]  back from the initial Nevada 2014 right right so
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:40.480]  it's obvious to me number one that the uh department of justice and the BLM and
[02:02:40.480 --> 02:02:43.600]  every other government agency involved including the IRS
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:47.280]  they are now taking to the offensive and they will round up the people
[02:02:47.280 --> 02:02:50.800]  whether or not i mean they're going to round up everyone who was involved
[02:02:50.800 --> 02:02:53.840]  and and assess their guilt later of course but
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:02:59.920]  after a period of isolation and of incarceration but the one thing that you
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:03.280]  said now i've been really paying a very close attention to this i mean look at
[02:03:03.280 --> 02:03:08.160]  the asian provocateurs here they are attempting the when i say they
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:12.560]  have talked about the powers that or control this are attempting to insinuate
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:16.960]  and infiltrate these organizations put in these uh these uh
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:21.040]  people who will provoke situations and then of course
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:25.520]  this is how something does happen but the result and i think this is the most
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:28.880]  important thing the result of this is to take every
[02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:32.240]  new media platform whether it's yours ours or
[02:03:32.240 --> 02:03:36.240]  whoever and reclassify it of course according to
[02:03:36.240 --> 02:03:39.520]  not just of my act report but a broader scope
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:44.880]  of of of of uh well broader by by just demonize it and claim it has no free
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:49.200]  speech rights that exactly right in it they have to shut us up
[02:03:49.200 --> 02:03:53.680]  and it's a lot easier to do it through the legal process so to speak sure
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:56.800]  that's it they're heating up for persecution of gun owners and land
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:04:00.880]  rights groups while arming all these federal agencies and just having them
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:04.400]  just hatefully treat citizens i mean families
[02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.320]  in national parks and stuff these armed guys show up and walk around and
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:12.880]  look at you with hate like like bullies you know you'd see as a
[02:04:12.880 --> 02:04:16.800]  a teenager or something and you're like wow you're really look at everybody

[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:11.440]  because the owners of this country don't want that
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:16.320]  i'm talking about the real owners now the real owners the big wealthy business
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:19.520]  interest that control things and make all the important decisions
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:23.040]  forget the politicians the politicians are put there to give you the idea
[02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:28.480]  that you have freedom of choice you don't you have no choice
[02:08:28.480 --> 02:08:34.720]  you have owners they own you they own everything they own all the important
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:38.240]  land they own and control the corporations they've long since bought and
[02:08:38.240 --> 02:08:41.200]  paid for the senate the congress the state houses and city halls they got the
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:44.560]  judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:47.680]  control just about all of the news and information you get to hear
[02:08:47.680 --> 02:08:54.400]  they got you by the balls they want obedient workers obedient
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:58.400]  workers people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:02.640]  and just dumb enough to passively accept jobs with the lower pay the longer
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:05.120]  hours to reduce benefits the end of overtime
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:08.000]  and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:11.600]  and now they're coming for your social security money
[02:09:11.600 --> 02:09:15.680]  so they can give it to their criminal friends on wall street
[02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:20.320]  it's a big club and you ain't in it and you said recently quote
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:24.320]  when you give they do whatever the hell you want them to do
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:27.600]  you better believe it so what specifically did they do
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:31.040]  if i ask them if i need them you know most of the people on this stage
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:34.240]  i've given to just so you understand a lot of money
[02:09:34.240 --> 02:09:39.840]  you and i are not in the big club the owners of this country know the truth
[02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:44.960]  it's called the american dream because you have to be asleep to believe it
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:49.120]  but i'll tell you what they don't want they don't want a population of citizens
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:51.840]  capable of critical thinking they don't want well-informed
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:55.520]  well-educated people capable of critical thinking they're not interested in that
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:59.840]  that doesn't help them that's against their interest that's right from the
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:04.000]  front lines of the information war it's alex
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:10.160]  john you can love him you can hate him but jesse
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:14.560]  ventura is known as one of the consummate political mavericks
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:17.920]  they say he basically wrote the book that arnold used to get elected as
[02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:21.120]  governor and then of course now so many other politicians have modeled
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:25.440]  insurrection campaigns off of jesse ventura he of course was an insurrectionist
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:29.360]  mayor then of course a governor he also was a top
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:32.720]  entertainment wrestler and movie star and bestselling author
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:36.080]  and he joins a series also a friend of mine i was
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:41.520]  part of two seasons of his investigative report conspiracy theory
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:44.640]  and now we have newt genridge coming out saying donald trump isn't part of the
[02:10:44.640 --> 02:10:48.080]  elite secret societies with a straight face that's why they're after him
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:51.520]  well jesse ventura is known him for multiple decades their friends
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:55.200]  play golf eat dinner hang out he said you know six months ago when i was
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:58.880]  looking into donald trump he said no he's for real it's exactly what you see
[02:10:58.880 --> 02:11:01.920]  now i know a bunch of people have known him forever and i say no what you really
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:05.680]  see is donald trump uh it is an incredible spectacle but here's the
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:09.600]  bigger question will jesse ventura throw his hat in the ring and run he has
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:14.560]  basically said we'll have him go into it in more detail uh that uh if it's an
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:18.000]  establishment candidate like hillary arubio that it looks like a green line
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:22.400]  how would that happen libertarian party because i like uh somebody like macafe
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:25.280]  but you know the more serious candidate would be the libertarian nomination
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:28.560]  because they're in all 50 states on the ballot you got to have that ballot access
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:33.520]  would be jesse ventura and exactly if there isn't a good candidate
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:37.520]  like a donald trump you know it's establishment that said here he is
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:40.880]  hanging out with richard in ha saying and he likes to have the cfr
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:44.080]  he's got genrich endorsing him i don't like that
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:47.040]  and but i'll be honest uh the whole power structure is against
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:51.440]  donald trump uh ventura was on for a long time on seeing in last night during
[02:11:51.440 --> 02:11:54.960]  the debate with their counter coverage so he didn't get to see it it was a blood
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:59.200]  bath it was media packages like eight or nine of them against trump
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:04.240]  everyone ganging up uh misrepresenting what he said and what he's done i mean
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:08.000]  they are scared of him for a reason he is challenging the system
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:11.440]  he's not spending money on the on the political punditry
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:16.320]  he's not getting the big campaign money it's like hearing jesse ventura talk
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:21.840]  because this is everything jesse has been basically harping on for decades
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:24.480]  i never thought he was beaten a dead horse i was just waiting for the right
[02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:28.960]  time to come uh and so no army can stop an idea whose time has come
[02:12:28.960 --> 02:12:33.680]  to quote victor hugo uh jesse so much happening i got a lot of questions a lot
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:37.040]  of comments i want to play some of the debate clips i want to play a clip
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:40.640]  of this campaign ad casick the warmonger who acts like he's just sweet little
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:44.400]  old man he was running where how dare trump not want to have war
[02:12:44.400 --> 02:12:48.320]  he's a tyrant so he says make america a tyranny again
[02:12:48.320 --> 02:12:52.320]  well i thought they're turning us into a tyranny so uh that's coming up as well
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:56.880]  uh good to talk to you hi alex great to be here yeah i uh
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:01.600]  i went on with uh cnn last night i know the debates i think rod fox or whatever
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:05.680]  so probably not a lot of people heard what i had to say but
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:10.000]  i brought up to them something that is really troubling to me
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:14.160]  first of all let me state this with all the current candidates that you have
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:18.000]  out there and that have been out there within the last four to five
[02:13:18.000 --> 02:13:22.160]  months i know a lot of them have dropped out i have one thing
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:26.720]  that none of them candidates have i have one thing that trump's
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:30.560]  money can't buy i have one thing that none of these
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:34.720]  candidates have you know what that is alex tell me
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:40.480]  i have an honorable discharge from the united states navy where i served from
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:46.400]  september the 11th 1969 until september the 10th 1975
[02:13:46.400 --> 02:13:50.880]  six years for unactive duty two years in the reserves
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:54.880]  so what i brought up last night on don lemon was
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:14:00.480]  something that disturbs me to no end and that is that then maybe i'll let these
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:05.040]  people off the hook because none of them were in the military
[02:14:05.040 --> 02:14:10.160]  so maybe they're ignorant and they don't know about what i'm going to talk about
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:16.240]  maybe that's it i'm not sure but i brought up the fact that every republican
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:19.760]  candidate right now has stated that they would
[02:14:19.760 --> 02:14:24.720]  commit a war crime that if if the situation arose
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:28.480]  they would okay torture they try to one up each other
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:35.280]  on what they do well and the point is that is a war crime alex if i did that
[02:14:35.280 --> 02:14:38.720]  as a member of the military and i took an oath
[02:14:38.720 --> 02:14:43.200]  i would not receive an honorable discharge committing a war crime
[02:14:43.200 --> 02:14:49.360]  i agree often the alleged leader of the military
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:54.800]  openly admit that he would commit that he or she would commit war crimes are you
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:58.480]  kidding me and no and nobody in the media
[02:14:58.480 --> 02:15:01.600]  jumps on that well it's probably good thing you didn't watch because you're
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:04.880]  friends with because your friends i guess it's bad to have
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:10.480]  david duke endorse you or whatever but that's out of your control
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:17.600]  but to sit and openly state trump included that they would commit war crimes
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:23.680]  and they're going to be commander-in-chief of the u.s. military
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:28.720]  and and i'm astounded the media doesn't even bring that up
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:33.840]  doesn't question them to the level they're questioning them on these other
[02:15:33.840 --> 02:15:36.560]  issues i'm glad you raised this because that's my
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:41.120]  biggest issue with trump is they yes hayden who was involved in all sorts of
[02:15:41.120 --> 02:15:44.240]  illegal stuff and then in authorizing torture illegal
[02:15:44.240 --> 02:15:48.640]  spying former head of the nsa former head of the cia going on
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:53.920]  bill marsha and saying oh he couldn't be president because the
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:57.040]  military won't follow his orders to do illegal things
[02:15:57.040 --> 02:16:00.560]  they've got most of the military following orders and trump showed a very
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:04.720]  tyrannical edge when he said don't worry i'm a leader the
[02:16:04.720 --> 02:16:08.160]  troops will follow my orders and unfortunately a lot of them would i
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.520]  know he wants to quote get tough on isis and stuff but you don't get tough on
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:14.480]  them lowering yourself to their level so i like on one hand
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:17.360]  he says we shouldn't be in syria we shouldn't have war with russia
[02:16:17.360 --> 02:16:21.680]  we shouldn't have created isis he tells the truth about 9 11 in saudi arabia
[02:16:21.680 --> 02:16:25.680]  and does great things but then he flips over and says
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:29.680]  you know we'll go after the wives of terrorists it's just
[02:16:29.680 --> 02:16:33.840]  what do you think of that sir well that's ridiculous you're asking you
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:39.120]  putting the a person who took an oath like i did in the united states military
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:42.160]  obviously the president's not going to do it
[02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:46.800]  it's going to be boots on the ground that will be asked to torture people
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:53.440]  or to kill innocent people and how dare them how dare them when they've never
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:57.680]  served themselves they've never been in a position
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:01.840]  where their life was on the line serving their country
[02:17:01.840 --> 02:17:06.400]  and here they would ask people who have put their lives on the line
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:12.640]  who have taken that oath to now go out and commit war crimes at their behest
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:16.320]  since you raised this in washington since you raised this
[02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:19.840]  then and have people commit war crimes
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:24.000]  i mean this sounds like something that would be in the elections of 1930
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:27.440]  germany absolutely well they actually kept
[02:17:27.440 --> 02:17:30.720]  stuff like that secret there uh joe biggs who was written about an
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:33.840]  esquire and vanity fair profiled by the late great
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:37.040]  hastings michael hastings in fact i want to if he's here right now i want to
[02:17:37.040 --> 02:17:40.320]  drag him in in the control room next break to talk to ventura
[02:17:40.320 --> 02:17:44.320]  briefly he's an army veteran uh it was a fair fortress
[02:17:44.320 --> 02:17:48.240]  um we got purple hearts and discharge honorable he says
[02:17:48.240 --> 02:17:50.560]  he doesn't really feel guilty because he didn't really understand what's happening
[02:17:50.560 --> 02:17:53.840]  at the time but later he did they would have they would order them to go pick
[02:17:53.840 --> 02:17:58.480]  people up they would take them to the dea and the cia in afghanistan
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:01.840]  and then they would sometimes torture them to death because there'd be a dead
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:05.280]  body the next day uh and then he took them to people to be
[02:18:05.280 --> 02:18:08.240]  tortured to death no judge no jury and that was about
[02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:11.440]  controlling the opium which we know went way up under our government
[02:18:11.440 --> 02:18:14.560]  so right there that's somebody boots on the ground
[02:18:14.560 --> 02:18:18.640]  many times going to pick people up to take them to be tortured to death
[02:18:18.640 --> 02:18:22.880]  yes and that's under and that falls directly to the responsibility of the
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:27.600]  commander in chief the president of the united states
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:32.400]  and when the president condones committing war crimes
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:37.040]  the united states and its people should hang their head in shame
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:41.280]  because fine you're fighting terrorists you're fighting people that are not
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:45.200]  probably not very good people but we should always hold
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:49.040]  ourselves to a higher standard well that's what george washington said the
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:51.920]  british had a lot of atrocities is one reason the public turned against them
[02:18:51.920 --> 02:18:55.360]  washington hung members of the col colonial military
[02:18:55.360 --> 02:18:58.800]  uh they got caught engaging in any war crimes
[02:18:58.800 --> 02:19:04.160]  absolutely you have to hold yourself to a higher standard to be on the side of
[02:19:04.160 --> 02:19:08.240]  right if you and and and let me put it to you this way
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:12.560]  all of these candidates they can get away with it they're not going to be put
[02:19:12.560 --> 02:19:16.000]  danger when they tell you that they're going to support
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:21.840]  torture that puts our military in danger remember one bush let people uh
[02:19:21.840 --> 02:19:24.880]  get prosecuted who followed orders of torture and then he didn't get in
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:29.280]  trouble absolutely but it it gets our our men and women have been
[02:19:29.280 --> 02:19:32.640]  in danger because if they're captured or anything
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:36.960]  happens to them well if we torture what right do we have to
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:40.480]  complain if our young and men and women in service get caught
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:43.440]  tortured there's a reason society develops chivalry it's because you don't
[02:19:43.440 --> 02:19:46.000]  want stuff happening to your wives and children and you know and there's
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:50.000]  something else too there's something called honor
[02:19:50.000 --> 02:19:53.840]  and when you take the oath to serve in the united states military
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:58.080]  you take an oath of honor and torture and war crimes
[02:19:58.080 --> 02:20:03.040]  are not powerful stay there stay there bad enough now they're adding ammonia

[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:11.200]  Jesse Ventura is our guest Biggs is walking down towards the studio right
[02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:16.000]  now to just tell his story briefly I want to shift gears in the next segment
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:20.720]  out of torture and war but since Jesse Ventura raises all this
[02:24:20.720 --> 02:24:24.240]  he's really got a good point it's almost like we've gotten broke back about
[02:24:24.240 --> 02:24:27.520]  this I made a big deal about this under bush
[02:24:27.520 --> 02:24:30.640]  and it was all secret then we had to prove torture was going on
[02:24:30.640 --> 02:24:34.480]  now they're just like I'll torture everybody I'll kill even more people
[02:24:34.480 --> 02:24:38.160]  I'm John Wayne and the weird part about it is
[02:24:38.160 --> 02:24:41.680]  it's like Hillary bragging I came I saw Gaddafi died
[02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:45.760]  or her bragging about killing people or Obama saying I'm good at killing people
[02:24:45.760 --> 02:24:50.080]  it's really weird to see somebody that's never killed anybody
[02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:52.960]  sit there and brag about it and the people I know that have killed a lot of
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:55.360]  people I got family members who've been in special
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:59.520]  operations you name it some one of them was in 35 years
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:03.760]  and I mean on the ground stuff and you know he became obviously a
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:07.120]  officer and got pretty high level but they'll never tell you any of the
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:09.920]  stories and boy that every once while they're horrible
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:14.240]  and they don't like talking about them but it's these wimpy people that really
[02:25:14.240 --> 02:25:19.120]  enjoy the idea of death and killing and studying history when you get an elite
[02:25:19.120 --> 02:25:22.400]  like that like a roman it's decline had these rulers that have never been in
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:26.560]  combat but we're into cruelty and evil it's crazy
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:29.520]  and then after the break I have that clip where they say that you know
[02:25:29.520 --> 02:25:33.120]  Trump's for tyranny because he doesn't want war in case you can all them
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:37.440]  will bloody the Russians knows we need Russian body bags blow up their
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:40.400]  airplanes and the Russians are literally doing
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:44.080]  nothing to anybody Jesse you were just over in Russia at a
[02:25:44.080 --> 02:25:46.960]  big press dinner a few months ago your interview here up on that
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:50.000]  went viral I want to bring Joe Biggs in since he's
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:53.200]  here Joe just briefly tell Governor Ventura it's a short segment
[02:25:53.200 --> 02:25:55.760]  I don't even know if you were listening earlier just your experience bringing
[02:25:55.760 --> 02:25:59.120]  people for torture yeah we would go out of missions in
[02:25:59.120 --> 02:26:02.880]  Afghanistan and we'd have these OGA guys with this other government
[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:07.040]  agencies and we would go in do tactical side
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:11.200]  exploitations clear houses where there were IED
[02:26:11.200 --> 02:26:14.640]  bomb-making facilities and essentially we take these guys
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:18.880]  back and these OGA guys would come in and interrogate them and we'd sit outside
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:22.480]  the little compound out in the coast province and we would sit
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:26.160]  there and you could hear the screams and yells and it was pretty intense
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:29.440]  and that stuff happened a lot some people came out some people didn't
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:33.920]  you know and we would be told to go guard opium fields and sometimes we'd be
[02:26:33.920 --> 02:26:37.360]  told to take them out it was a pinning whether or not these
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:41.200]  farmers would play ball with the military now now you could argue hey
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:43.840]  they got bombs or plan to blow somebody up we got a torture to find who they're
[02:26:43.840 --> 02:26:46.160]  going to kill next that's the maximum idea but then our own
[02:26:46.160 --> 02:26:49.840]  government's growing the opium and then funding isis and now it's worse than
[02:26:49.840 --> 02:26:52.560]  ever well they were more concerned with protecting
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:57.680]  those opium fields and they were actually detaining and interrogating these
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:01.200]  IED making facility places these people they were operating
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:05.520]  these guys would get captured and then essentially released not that long
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:09.280]  after it's the ones who weren't going to play ball with the opium fields those
[02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:12.080]  are the ones who would get it the most because that's where the most money was made
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:15.360]  this is short 7-1 venture to pop in that you are you able to come back briefly
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:20.080]  governor well you know the more i hear about these wars
[02:27:20.080 --> 02:27:26.320]  both afghanistan and iraq and all that i'll just say this i you know i had a
[02:27:26.320 --> 02:27:31.280]  young man who i kind of tutored he went into the navy seals he went to iraq he
[02:27:31.280 --> 02:27:35.680]  came back he actually brought me something that i have here in my house
[02:27:35.680 --> 02:27:39.440]  from iraq i better not say what who knows what
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:43.840]  had happened but uh anyway i asked him a simple question
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:47.840]  too i said when you're over there do you know who the enemy is and he said
[02:27:47.840 --> 02:27:51.280]  absolutely not i said then it's identical to vietnam
[02:27:51.280 --> 02:27:56.160]  that's all i needed to hear and uh you know what i'm watching in these wars
[02:27:56.160 --> 02:28:00.080]  when people tell me to ask me if a war is justified
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:04.080]  it's a real simple answer to me a war is justified if you're willing to send your
[02:28:04.080 --> 02:28:07.280]  son if you're not willing to send your son how do you
[02:28:07.280 --> 02:28:10.880]  send someone else's and i would not send my son over
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:14.640]  there for these wars because they're total bs
[02:28:14.640 --> 02:28:18.800]  they're just like smidley butler wrote in his book war is a racket
[02:28:18.800 --> 02:28:22.560]  this is a classic example of it and then hearing this from
[02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:26.880]  the veteran himself who's over there seeing and hearing that we are
[02:28:26.880 --> 02:28:31.440]  torturing people well how do we then look at them
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:35.680]  and condemn them if we're doing the same thing exactly how is north korea bad
[02:28:35.680 --> 02:28:40.240]  for torturing but then we're not exactly i mean if we don't hold
[02:28:40.240 --> 02:28:44.080]  ourselves to a standard and have some type of honor
[02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:49.360]  then what is it all really about it's amazing and joe you told me a lot of
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:51.600]  these stories a lot of them got written about you you were saying this was
[02:28:51.600 --> 02:28:54.080]  pretty much routine uh you know you were over there a
[02:28:54.080 --> 02:28:57.840]  couple years in afghanistan and then iraq or back and forth i mean how many
[02:28:57.840 --> 02:29:01.120]  times would you say you took people you know scooped them up to take them to be
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:05.200]  quote interrogated i mean in afghanistan alone
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:08.960]  probably i don't know about a dozen times or more
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:13.360]  somewhere in there iraq uh not as much iraq i was mostly just
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:17.760]  uh like he said like uh governor vinter said you couldn't tell who the enemy
[02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:20.720]  was and iraq he just drove around waiting to be blown up
[02:29:20.720 --> 02:29:24.240]  and then you know you're looking around and there's kids and there's a bizarre
[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:27.440]  and there's families running around you have no idea who it is shooting at you
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:31.600]  or pushing the trigger to blow you up it was intense it was insane
[02:29:31.600 --> 02:29:35.440]  it was horrible every day there's one thing you guys find you know you're
[02:29:35.440 --> 02:29:37.920]  going to fight them but i couldn't imagine just constantly not knowing where
[02:29:37.920 --> 02:29:41.280]  it is and it's just crazy thank you you know again
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:45.600]  that tells me it's a completely identical to vietnam because in vietnam
[02:29:45.600 --> 02:29:48.400]  you have the vc exactly governor stay there we're going
[02:29:48.400 --> 02:29:51.680]  to put his people there absolutely we're to come right back long segment

[02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:16.320]  scared of donald trump gingrich would know about secret societies
[02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:20.560]  given his affiliation with bohemian growth although he could also be speaking
[02:30:20.560 --> 02:30:23.440]  of the skull and bones club which is notorious for its
[02:30:23.440 --> 02:30:27.040]  initiation rituals so far trump has played the role of
[02:30:27.040 --> 02:30:31.520]  outsider and people are loving him for it but he has held private briefings with

[02:33:28.560 --> 02:33:31.680]  i've forgotten to get bigs to tell the story about his captain
[02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:37.200]  he was a staff sergeant now a colonel once he came to work here and was
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:39.760]  talking about the stuff the phone call he got
[02:33:39.760 --> 02:33:42.800]  so joe bigs relayed that story to governor ventura
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:46.720]  so he can respond yeah so when i was in the 82nd airborne i had this captain i
[02:33:46.720 --> 02:33:49.200]  can't remember his name right now especially after that conversation i
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:53.440]  got about two years ago i kind of blocked the guy out of my memory

[02:34:10.320 --> 02:34:14.080]  blah blah blah in the 82nd airborne and i go okay i remember and he goes
[02:34:14.080 --> 02:34:17.120]  yeah i'm a colonel now in the army and you know what you're doing right now
[02:34:17.120 --> 02:34:20.880]  it's truly and honestly disgusting your disgrace
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:25.680]  um you need to shut the f up and stop talking about what you're doing
[02:34:25.680 --> 02:34:30.240]  you are giving soldiers a bad name speaking out about what's going on
[02:34:30.240 --> 02:34:33.920]  i've heard your reports about afghanistan what's going on with the opium
[02:34:33.920 --> 02:34:38.800]  shut up stop it you know basically like that and it went on for about 30 minutes
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:41.600]  and you know i hang up the phone and mcbreen's looking at me he's like man
[02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:44.320]  what just happened i look like an intense call and i was like man
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:48.240]  this guy just basically threatened me told me to shut up for what i was talking
[02:34:48.240 --> 02:34:53.280]  about at info wars so i mean that was super intense i came out of nowhere
[02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:59.360]  well it's sad and as i explained it's difficult to be a whistleblower because
[02:34:59.360 --> 02:35:04.560]  people you know and people that are are involved with you many of them will view
[02:35:04.560 --> 02:35:08.000]  you as a traitor oh yeah and many of them will
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:13.040]  will you know just be very hostile and that's what makes being a whistleblower
[02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:18.000]  it's a difficult thing that takes a great deal of courage and i always respect
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:22.000]  someone who sees something wrong and has the
[02:35:22.000 --> 02:35:26.320]  courage to bring it to the forefront regardless of how they themselves may
[02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:32.160]  suffer from doing it those are heroes when i was an afghanistan heroes not not
[02:35:32.160 --> 02:35:35.440]  a lot of these other people they try to claim our heroes
[02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:39.280]  yeah when i was in afghanistan there was a reporter there well known combat
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:43.120]  journalist michael hasings and he was he asked me a question one of the interviews
[02:35:43.120 --> 02:35:45.760]  he goes what do you think about the taliban here what do you think about
[02:35:45.760 --> 02:35:50.240]  these people who uh want to kill you and i said i have a great
[02:35:50.240 --> 02:35:52.640]  deal of respect for him i was like guess what
[02:35:52.640 --> 02:35:55.440]  we're flying over here we're bombing the hell out of him
[02:35:55.440 --> 02:35:58.800]  we're shooting at him we're blowing him up for our own reasons
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:02.160]  what would you do if you were sitting in your backyard and paratroopers started
[02:36:02.160 --> 02:36:05.840]  falling out of the sky and your homeland people started attacking you
[02:36:05.840 --> 02:36:08.720]  and you're just sitting there like all right well i've got to pick up arms and
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:13.040]  defend myself i said i don't blame them for wanting to kill me but at the same
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:17.200]  time i'm going to protect my men that are with me and make sure we get home
[02:36:17.200 --> 02:36:20.560]  but at the same time i can respect them for doing what they're doing as well
[02:36:20.560 --> 02:36:24.560]  thank you job interesting testimony but the point is is it's known opium
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:28.160]  production went from three percent to 93 within two years of us being there
[02:36:28.160 --> 02:36:32.240]  it's known they're torturing people so so why call up and tell them to shut up
[02:36:32.240 --> 02:36:36.880]  when it's his birthright to have free speech uh jesse well of course it is but
[02:36:36.880 --> 02:36:40.880]  you know we don't live in it we remember something we don't live in an era
[02:36:40.880 --> 02:36:44.880]  anymore where the bill of rights matters
[02:36:44.880 --> 02:36:48.480]  you and i have talked about it thousands of times alex how
[02:36:48.480 --> 02:36:52.720]  the bill of rights is trampled they don't they have no regard for it
[02:36:52.720 --> 02:36:56.800]  whatsoever so it doesn't surprise me that
[02:36:56.800 --> 02:37:01.760]  free speech is the first why wouldn't they take that down also now it's
[02:37:01.760 --> 02:37:05.920]  selective speech i guess i want to play you a couple clips
[02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:09.040]  since you missed the debate and we haven't played these yet so the listeners
[02:37:09.040 --> 02:37:12.640]  want to hear these uh i know you like putin you've been over
[02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:16.880]  there for a big press dinner many i don't necessarily like him but i respect
[02:37:16.880 --> 02:37:20.800]  him and i met him briefly and i'd certainly love to sit down and talk with
[02:37:20.800 --> 02:37:23.840]  him more well i'll say this i like the straight
[02:37:23.840 --> 02:37:27.680]  shooting i like the fact he's defending the family national sovereignty uh i
[02:37:27.680 --> 02:37:30.640]  don't see russia involved in any of our interests russia's not doing anything to
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:34.320]  america it's the globalists that are doing it they're the ones taking my rights
[02:37:34.320 --> 02:37:38.080]  i agree and so i don't put words here about the point is you respect putin
[02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:41.360]  he's got two overseas military bases where people invited them in we have
[02:37:41.360 --> 02:37:45.840]  over 300 we're in 100 plus countries uh so so it's
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:49.520]  super super ridiculous you know to say bloody their nose
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:53.120]  trumps a trader because he says he knows putin and would try to work with him and
[02:37:53.120 --> 02:37:56.160]  be friends and have business relations between our
[02:37:56.160 --> 02:38:01.120]  countries why not and so this is what john kasek
[02:38:01.120 --> 02:38:05.920]  uh put out uh this is the video they put out
[02:38:05.920 --> 02:38:10.080]  trump putin 2016 make tyranny great again
[02:38:10.080 --> 02:38:14.000]  so they're acting like trump and putin are the threat not the tyrants that are
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.560]  pushing all this uh here is the kasek tv yet
[02:38:18.560 --> 02:38:22.320]  in a stunning development today donald trump announced his running mate
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:26.720]  russian president vladimir putin he was my stable mate i believe i'll get along
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:29.600]  with him it was trump and putin putin and trump
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:33.760]  the decision would be illegal and unconstitutional but not unexpected in
[02:38:33.760 --> 02:38:37.200]  light of mr trump's recent pro putin rhetoric
[02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:41.360]  do you like vladimir putin's comments about you sure when people call you
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:45.280]  pretty it that's always good vladimir putin welcomed the news and only had
[02:38:45.280 --> 02:38:49.200]  glowing words to say for trump he was a brilliant and talented person
[02:38:49.200 --> 02:38:52.000]  without a doubt if elected trump promised that the
[02:38:52.000 --> 02:38:56.640]  dictatorial duo would quote make tyranny great again
[02:38:56.640 --> 02:39:00.400]  i think i'd get along very well with vladimir putin
[02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:04.800]  i just think so and they say that he's running for office will he make tyranny
[02:39:04.800 --> 02:39:10.240]  great again and what the hell is wrong with that
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:16.480]  you know i all these other guys all they want to do is fight war
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:21.920]  well they're they're not even good at it yeah we have kassan iraq we can't go to
[02:39:21.920 --> 02:39:25.120]  war with russia or china who have icbms just
[02:39:25.120 --> 02:39:29.280]  who clinton gave to him i mean to those chinese i just don't understand
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:32.960]  what is russia doing to us except not letting the west take the satellite
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:35.680]  countries around it and put missiles on its border
[02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:40.560]  exactly and you know i'd rather have someone who can talk to vladimir
[02:39:40.560 --> 02:39:43.440]  putin than someone who ignores him and attacks him
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:49.200]  okay six seven to bloody their nose well here you got another guy who never
[02:39:49.200 --> 02:39:53.120]  served in the military who's making these military
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:56.480]  decisions because he doesn't have to do it
[02:39:56.480 --> 02:40:00.320]  you know i think it's time to elect a veteran
[02:40:00.320 --> 02:40:04.480]  we haven't had a veteran in the right house for a long long time
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:09.440]  well certainly in a combat event like jfk jfk jfk was a hero he was blown up
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:11.440]  you know in that pt boat fight the battleship
[02:40:11.440 --> 02:40:18.320]  in a even nixon served yeah you know we but i think personally it is time we
[02:40:18.320 --> 02:40:22.240]  get a veteran and it doesn't mean you got to be a war hero
[02:40:22.240 --> 02:40:25.600]  or you got to be anything like that just someone who is
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:30.320]  has gone on with their life took and taken the oath
[02:40:30.320 --> 02:40:34.160]  and stood ready to give their life sure exactly as you know
[02:40:34.160 --> 02:40:37.680]  kennedy candidates that did that kennedy can hardly walk at the time
[02:40:37.680 --> 02:40:40.400]  because i mean literally in a little it wasn't a pt
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:43.200]  boat or destroyer which is one of those little attack boats in a fight with a
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:46.000]  japanese battleship and of course he didn't want to start a bunch of wars
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:51.280]  since it actually been in one well i'm giving back to it alex it's
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:57.440]  it's time to elect a veteran instead of not in someone that knows what it's like
[02:40:57.440 --> 02:41:01.840]  to take an oath and to be prepared to die for your country
[02:41:01.840 --> 02:41:04.720]  none of these presidential candidates right now
[02:41:04.720 --> 02:41:10.640]  have ever did that none of them well eisenhower warned us about the
[02:41:10.640 --> 02:41:14.560]  military industrial complex i mean we buy multi-billion dollar jet
[02:41:14.560 --> 02:41:19.280]  fighters that the pentagon admits isn't even as good as a 10 million
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:23.040]  or 15 million dollar f15 that's 25 years old
[02:41:23.040 --> 02:41:28.160]  i mean we are being screwed over alex not only that we continue to build these
[02:41:28.160 --> 02:41:33.440]  aircraft carriers that are sitting duck targets
[02:41:33.440 --> 02:41:37.840]  for the for the countries out there that have ballistic missiles
[02:41:37.840 --> 02:41:41.440]  well yeah it's cruise missiles craft carriers off like shooting ducks in a
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:46.400]  pond cruise missile take it out and and the point is we continue to build them
[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:50.800]  and float around on the ocean with them you know
[02:41:50.800 --> 02:41:55.360]  for what it's called treason
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:42:00.160]  you know it's it's it's wasteful i believe here's what i believe alex
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:03.360]  we have enough problems in our own country right now
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:08.560]  we need to start focusing on fixing up the united states of america
[02:42:08.560 --> 02:42:12.080]  anybody does a does flint michigan ring a bell
[02:42:12.080 --> 02:42:14.080]  exactly we're falling apart let me ask you this question
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:16.880]  so one of your own words i saw newspaper article but i want to i don't
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:19.280]  trust newspapers to have the time they lie
[02:42:19.280 --> 02:42:22.320]  where are you on running for president what is the climate or what is the
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:25.840]  circumstances that will induce you to run
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:29.920]  well right now it's about a 30 day window i have
[02:42:29.920 --> 02:42:34.480]  roughly to inform i've i've been in contact with the with the libertarian
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:37.760]  party they have formally invited me to their
[02:42:37.760 --> 02:42:43.120]  to their uh convention in orlando and that's where they give out their
[02:42:43.120 --> 02:42:46.240]  nomination or or you know support and you're
[02:42:46.240 --> 02:42:50.320]  you go on the ballot as the libertarian's choice for president
[02:42:50.320 --> 02:42:54.800]  uh it's totally personal now for me whether i want to get involved at that
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:43:00.240]  level and go 24 seven and put myself through
[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:04.400]  what a campaign from june through november would do
[02:43:04.400 --> 02:43:11.200]  to me and my family uh but right now i don't see anybody out there
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:14.960]  bernie sanders i talked with him a couple days ago
[02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:20.640]  and he unequivocally told me that if he loses which chances are he's going to
[02:43:20.640 --> 02:43:24.080]  he's got a remarkable thing but hillary's got the super
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:29.440]  delegates so that's the fix and uh what if bernie loses he is
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:36.080]  going to endorse hillary which to me it stops the revolution
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:40.560]  how do you go get on board with somebody you've just accused of being owned by
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:44.400]  wall street who is stealing the popular vote with super
[02:43:44.400 --> 02:43:47.840]  delegates well yeah and here's what i think they got in
[02:43:47.840 --> 02:43:52.560]  mind let me project this out that there's with these two parties you notice
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:56.400]  all the candidates agree they'll support whoever the party chooses
[02:43:56.400 --> 02:44:00.000]  well that shows loyalty to the party not the country
[02:44:00.000 --> 02:44:03.440]  that shows their true colors they're loyal to their party that's why jorge
[02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:08.160]  washington won a political party's banned exactly and the but the thing is
[02:44:08.160 --> 02:44:12.880]  here's what i think is going to happen alex i think sanders will lose
[02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:18.960]  and then he will endorse hillary and hillary may take him as the vp
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:22.560]  and that way it'll attempt to bring the sanders people in line with the
[02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:28.160]  clinton people and if that happens they certainly will defeat the republican
[02:44:28.160 --> 02:44:31.440]  yeah because they don't bring sanders in a lot of people are going to go trump
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:35.360]  they've said that the polls show that well i don't know if they're going to go
[02:44:35.360 --> 02:44:38.560]  trump necessarily but here's where i sit
[02:44:38.560 --> 02:44:42.000]  where would the sanders people prefer to go and where would the trump people
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:46.000]  prefer to go if they don't make it to a jesse ventura to a libertarian
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:51.440]  truly a centrist i'm in the middle i don't need to go to the far left i
[02:44:51.440 --> 02:44:55.040]  don't need to go to the far right that's how i won minnesota
[02:44:55.040 --> 02:44:58.560]  the republican norm colman had to appease the far right
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:03.440]  skip Humphrey had to appease the far left i had the center which wins it
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:07.360]  they couldn't get back in the middle well let me tell you they know you could
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:10.240]  win and certainly when the position to win until they ran
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:13.680]  the political assassination character assassination things that you were
[02:45:13.680 --> 02:45:16.640]  stopped drunk driving when you're another state wasn't true
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:20.400]  uh that you you know that you were happy
[02:45:20.400 --> 02:45:24.880]  don't first of all these the court still haven't rendered the decision that
[02:45:24.880 --> 02:45:28.880]  repeal spot we're still waiting and the second is
[02:45:28.880 --> 02:45:33.520]  that's getting behind me people now know the truth people know no i know i've
[02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:36.240]  noticed that so that lie is wearing off that's good news but
[02:45:36.240 --> 02:45:39.120]  what i'm saying is they did that because they know you're a contender
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:44.400]  they're already doing it now i i rattled my sordid marco rubio came up here
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:48.640]  and and pulled me in and said that i'm an embarrassment to the state of minnesota
[02:45:48.640 --> 02:45:52.720]  an embarrassment today so they're already shooting at you
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:57.120]  oh they're shooting at me already they're shooting and i laughed and i
[02:45:57.120 --> 02:46:00.800]  you know on the rubio thing and i and i said an embarrassment and he's a
[02:46:00.800 --> 02:46:04.480]  follower of and he said i'm an embarrassment like trump who came out
[02:46:04.480 --> 02:46:09.120]  of entertainment and it shows what a hypocrite he is because he says he's a
[02:46:09.120 --> 02:46:14.160]  follower of ronald reagan well excuse me if he were old enough to know
[02:46:14.160 --> 02:46:17.600]  ronald reagan came from entertainment too
[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:21.520]  rubio you like reagan because he did stuff like when we got bombed for no
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:26.240]  reason pull out of you know pull out that's not running it's being smart
[02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:29.600]  this little rubio you know you know what i call rubio
[02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:35.840]  he's the spineless puppet he's up there totally controlled by the
[02:46:35.840 --> 02:46:40.000]  lizard of ours he's a puppet he's the one the puppets have put forward the
[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:43.680]  controlling people who want to win they want rubio
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:47.360]  because he's nothing but a puppet i agreed let me inject this question i
[02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:50.560]  read in the newspaper report that i covered yesterday that you did to
[02:46:50.560 --> 02:46:54.560]  paraphrase you said look if it's not sanders or it's not trump if it's not
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:58.160]  an anti establishment candidate i'm going to run probably is a libertarian
[02:46:58.160 --> 02:47:01.120]  and then you got 30 days to do it specifically you're saying
[02:47:01.120 --> 02:47:06.000]  what uh and i understand i mean are you leaning 64
[02:47:06.000 --> 02:47:10.720]  40 against it's it's 50 50 right now
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:17.360]  it's 50 50 right now i i want to see who wins these final marks things so we're
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:22.080]  pretty sure then who the two candidates are going to be but you never know
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:25.360]  i mean they could go to that convention and they could take it right away from
[02:47:25.360 --> 02:47:27.680]  donald if they want i was about to say would you run against
[02:47:27.680 --> 02:47:32.400]  donald trump sure if i choose to run and he's the
[02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:36.960]  republican candidate i run against republicans and democrats regardless of
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:40.960]  no i understand but surely the the the trump thing is an anti-establishment
[02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:44.480]  run well that's true but maybe maybe a lot of
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:48.400]  anti-establishment i you know donald still supports
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:52.160]  you know torturing people he's going to blow up and
[02:47:52.160 --> 02:47:57.440]  and exploit the wars more all of these so you've gone from a month ago saying
[02:47:57.440 --> 02:48:00.640]  you like donald but his torture comments are pushing over the edge to
[02:48:00.640 --> 02:48:04.400]  maybe ready to run up against him well not just that but his war comments
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:08.880]  they're all going to go to war again i'm sick of these wars i want out of
[02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:13.200]  there i want to bring and i'll tell you what if they want to put roles at the
[02:48:13.200 --> 02:48:16.480]  borders bring all our troops home and let the troops
[02:48:16.480 --> 02:48:19.840]  sure sure but in fairness to trump you don't want to be racist in fairness to
[02:48:19.840 --> 02:48:22.640]  trump he's against uh libya against syria against
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:25.920]  having war with russia i think the tough guy talk is rhetoric
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:28.960]  because he knows what the republican audience is like they think torture is
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:32.720]  really tough well whatever i could only go by
[02:48:32.720 --> 02:48:37.040]  what he says and if he's just doing that to win the republicans over
[02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:40.400]  then that doesn't carry weight with me now i hear you what do you think of the
[02:48:40.400 --> 02:48:44.880]  cfr head uh meaning with him who's that now
[02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:49.840]  richard in haws met with him a good newt gennrich is basically endorsed him now
[02:48:49.840 --> 02:48:53.680]  have endorsed trump yeah i don't like that yeah
[02:48:53.680 --> 02:48:57.120]  well that's the republican party they're gonna do what they're gonna do
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:49:01.680]  see i think that if you see when if i were to run alex i would
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:05.520]  say it doesn't matter who they run they're still the republicans and the
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:09.120]  democrats absolutely jesse let me shift gears then
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:14.080]  separately ships off the coast of china north korea threatening to use nukes
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:17.920]  uh us proxy war in ukraine uh starting war with russia
[02:49:17.920 --> 02:49:21.120]  it seems like our leader going insane what would you say about the state of
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:23.760]  the climate of the world right now politically
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:27.200]  well i'd say that the united states needs to stop
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:31.680]  being the major force of the war throughout the world because
[02:49:31.680 --> 02:49:35.040]  every world that happens now we're involved in it
[02:49:35.040 --> 02:49:41.280]  in one way or another and i'm sick of it i i i again i'll follow the teachings
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:45.840]  of the two-time congressional medal of honor winner general smidley butler
[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:49.920]  our troops shouldn't go over 500 miles from our shoreline they should be for
[02:49:49.920 --> 02:49:55.040]  protecting the united states of america not being involved in regime
[02:49:55.040 --> 02:49:59.920]  overthrows and invading and occupying other countries and
[02:49:59.920 --> 02:50:04.560]  going to afghanistan to make sure the opium's getting out like it should
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:07.280]  let me let me crystallize this and i want to go to phone calls for you sir i'm
[02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:10.000]  skipping this network break so we have more time i'm gonna take a moment and
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:13.680]  plug here in a second before we go to calls the callers get ready
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:17.840]  i don't want to have you know uh a emotional debate with you we've had
[02:50:17.840 --> 02:50:21.040]  real discussions many times over dinner or on the rub of the tv show and before
[02:50:21.040 --> 02:50:24.560]  that but i want to be serious here about where i stand
[02:50:24.560 --> 02:50:28.480]  we haven't replaced our population we need to bring in people
[02:50:28.480 --> 02:50:31.520]  i love you know folks that come in from latin america people that come from
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:37.360]  china great people um i don't like being groped at the tsa being
[02:50:37.360 --> 02:50:41.120]  checked uh i don't like when i come to the border getting
[02:50:41.120 --> 02:50:44.320]  the third degree everything searched when i flew back in from cancun
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:47.440]  the last two times to our flight direct from austin back
[02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:50.000]  you would think that a till of the hunt was coming through
[02:50:50.000 --> 02:50:53.520]  yeah so so here's the deal go ahead and open the borders up completely but i'm
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:58.320]  going to be left alone too what i'm saying is don't leave the borders open
[02:50:58.320 --> 02:51:00.880]  i mean they admit they got flights coming in all over the country they even
[02:51:00.880 --> 02:51:03.280]  check the ids of people under obama's orders
[02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:06.160]  they're bringing in muslim refugees who they don't even check or vet them
[02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:10.240]  that's confirmed so all i'm saying is vet the people
[02:51:10.240 --> 02:51:14.560]  check they're not criminals and then treat citizens as least as good as you
[02:51:14.560 --> 02:51:17.280]  treat people because i get being nice to the third
[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:21.120]  world people we need hard workers but they are bringing them in to kind of
[02:51:21.120 --> 02:51:23.920]  make them a political voting block give them voter ids
[02:51:23.920 --> 02:51:27.840]  i just hope you can see the other side of the issue as well and see where
[02:51:27.840 --> 02:51:30.800]  trump is right to say hey you got to vet people
[02:51:30.800 --> 02:51:33.920]  and if you're not going to check their ids at least you got to stop it all
[02:51:33.920 --> 02:51:37.440]  until you're doing it the media misrepresents what he says so often
[02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:41.760]  you're right about the torture and i mean that is wrong and he did say that
[02:51:41.760 --> 02:51:44.560]  but on the other stuff they're twisting what he said
[02:51:44.560 --> 02:51:48.720]  well that may be so my belief on immigration is simply this if we're
[02:51:48.720 --> 02:51:52.320]  tired of immigrants then let's stop it all together
[02:51:52.320 --> 02:51:56.640]  see the problem with immigration is you can't have gray area
[02:51:56.640 --> 02:52:00.720]  you either got to have light or black you know it's that simple you either
[02:52:00.720 --> 02:52:05.120]  have immigration fully you can't just eliminate certain people from it
[02:52:05.120 --> 02:52:09.760]  or you have none and it seems to me we're to the point where we're ready to say
[02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:12.480]  we don't want no both sure but i would say now you're going to the extreme
[02:52:12.480 --> 02:52:15.440]  example please i know come on i see your point get rid of
[02:52:15.440 --> 02:52:18.720]  Statue of Liberty alex bring with troops i'm not having an argument with you i
[02:52:18.720 --> 02:52:21.600]  agree with a lot of what you're saying what i'm saying is
[02:52:21.600 --> 02:52:24.960]  they're at elis Island they kept you for three months to make sure you didn't
[02:52:24.960 --> 02:52:28.080]  have tb they let people in with hiv and tb now
[02:52:28.080 --> 02:52:31.760]  and then they shut whole schools down in austin and the kids are getting it
[02:52:31.760 --> 02:52:36.160]  you can't bring a 12-year-old with tb and stick them next to my kids
[02:52:36.160 --> 02:52:40.000]  i'm saying it's so extreme with the left they'll bring somebody in governor with
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:44.240]  drug-resistant tb now come on you agree they should be checked right
[02:52:44.240 --> 02:52:48.240]  absolutely well then good then bring them in after the checks we need to do
[02:52:48.240 --> 02:52:52.640]  we need to check to see if it was monsanto that created the new
[02:52:52.640 --> 02:52:57.200]  zika virus i agree absolutely sir because they went down there and spread a
[02:52:57.200 --> 02:53:01.680]  bunch of chemicals in the water mosquitoes don't normally carry virus
[02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:05.680]  they mutated track them you're right that that top sign is on
[02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:09.440]  mosquitoes and now the mosquitoes are giving it to us you're right the effect
[02:53:09.440 --> 02:53:12.160]  a lot of signers think they mutated because the chemicals you're right
[02:53:12.160 --> 02:53:15.520]  yeah and yet they don't you don't hear that reported do you
[02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:19.840]  the they're doing to the mosquitoes what they're doing to the gun
[02:53:19.840 --> 02:53:24.240]  they're blaming the gun for all these shootouts when the reality is it's the
[02:53:24.240 --> 02:53:28.320]  pharmaceutical drugs that the shooters have been put on
[02:53:28.320 --> 02:53:32.800]  oh i saw a great uh there's your common denominator and they won't talk about it
[02:53:32.800 --> 02:53:36.080]  because you're not allowed to talk about pharma in the media oh yeah
[02:53:36.080 --> 02:53:39.840]  i was they swore i was on three segments pierce morgan hyzer eggs ever had
[02:53:39.840 --> 02:53:43.520]  and i'm sitting there and i attack big pharma the first segment they go don't
[02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:47.200]  do that again the producer come over they'll do not talk about our sponsors
[02:53:47.200 --> 02:53:50.880]  and i came back on and did it and they cut it they cut it off they said that's
[02:53:50.880 --> 02:53:54.560]  it get out of here all because i said you got prozac ads during the
[02:53:54.560 --> 02:53:57.920]  commercials and every one of the shooters has been on it
[02:53:57.920 --> 02:54:02.320]  well and then then the pointers they won't bring that out they stop it at the
[02:54:02.320 --> 02:54:05.840]  gun they blame the gun just like with this
[02:54:05.840 --> 02:54:09.360]  zika virus they're blaming the mosquito
[02:54:09.360 --> 02:54:13.040]  they're not blaming the fact that chemicals allegedly were put into the
[02:54:13.040 --> 02:54:17.600]  water down there to kill the mosquitoes clearly it didn't work and the mosquitoes
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:21.200]  are passing this on to now the humans yes sir we're gonna go to calls here just
[02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:24.880]  one or two before you got to go it's it's great to have you on it'll be
[02:54:24.880 --> 02:54:28.080]  amazing if you run for president i just can't wait to be able to cover that i
[02:54:28.080 --> 02:54:32.000]  just want to give you know people i want to break this spell to everybody
[02:54:32.000 --> 02:54:36.400]  thinks you have to elect a democrat or republican why you're running
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:40.000]  i can tell you're running why why do you have to elect them
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:44.800]  jesse i sense more energy than you then in the the 10 years i've known you
[02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:48.720]  you're more aggressive like you use you're running for president buddy
[02:54:48.720 --> 02:54:53.600]  no i ain't i'm 50 50 i'm gonna watch what happens this
[02:54:53.600 --> 02:54:56.880]  month no i think you recognize history is happening this is a
[02:54:56.880 --> 02:55:00.800]  special election and you want to be heard bare minimum you cannot lose
[02:55:00.800 --> 02:55:04.000]  when it comes to injecting real issues and so i think you're running for
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:07.840]  president you you're you're i i think you're doing it
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:13.120]  well alex all i'll do with that is say don't hold your breath on it
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:17.760]  i can't hold it for 30 days promise me that i know you're going to see it
[02:55:17.760 --> 02:55:22.000]  you're not a alex you're not a gray whale you can't hold your breath that
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:25.360]  long i want a champion swimmer like you i
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:27.600]  didn't win blue ribbons and dallas so i have to swim
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:30.160]  i can only how long has ever held my breath was two minutes but listen how
[02:55:30.160 --> 02:55:32.000]  long did you hold your breath in the seals
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:37.600]  i don't know we had to do 75 foot three dives though we had to go down 75 feet
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:41.120]  get sand and bring it back to the surface that's the farthest i've ever
[02:55:41.120 --> 02:55:44.720]  gone the big sick i think i don't remember if we did 75 if we actually did
[02:55:44.720 --> 02:55:47.920]  100 i don't even recall we did it at sank on any island
[02:55:47.920 --> 02:55:51.280]  yeah well the secret is you know you pressurize so it oxygenates because it
[02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:53.760]  puts more pressure so suddenly go down 60 70 feet
[02:55:53.760 --> 02:55:57.120]  that's about the depth where you go whoa i can breathe i mean i feel good now
[02:55:57.120 --> 02:55:59.680]  and then then you got to go with the cycle but once you start going back up
[02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:02.640]  it starts unoxygenated and there's that panic you know
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:06.720]  it's a secret just to swim fast and grab the sand and don't let it get out of
[02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:09.600]  your hand before you got to show up for the instructor
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:14.000]  what about these three divers that go down 1400 feet
[02:56:14.800 --> 02:56:19.360]  that's pretty amazing huh oh yeah yeah that's you know i'm too old to do that
[02:56:19.360 --> 02:56:22.400]  well most of no actually all of them that have done that have died
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:25.280]  everyone that goes to those depths keeps doing it they all die
[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:29.680]  yeah i don't know like i said i'm 64 i can't swim like i used to
[02:56:29.680 --> 02:56:32.240]  you know we're just out of time i'm gonna have to go to james everybody else
[02:56:32.240 --> 02:56:36.560]  after you go i'm gonna go into overdrive here david knight's coming up but jesse
[02:56:36.560 --> 02:56:40.080]  so much more is happening in the world uh the reason i would say run i don't want
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:42.640]  you to kill yourself doing it i know you've been through a lot
[02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:46.880]  but i know if you ran you you would run to win uh i love seeing the trump
[02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:50.240]  phenomenon of a maverick yeah i know you're a real maverick i have
[02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:53.120]  questions about trump i think he's a good guy you say he's a good guy
[02:56:53.120 --> 02:56:56.240]  i'm supporting him right now but i would love for you to run just because the
[02:56:56.240 --> 02:57:00.160]  bully pulpit you'd get and uh i'd love to be able to you know let me know
[02:57:00.160 --> 02:57:02.240]  want to be there at that press conference when you announce
[02:57:02.240 --> 02:57:06.240]  okay well like i said if i do it i'm doing it to give people
[02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:09.840]  what i believe they're really seeking and that's an alternative to the
[02:57:09.840 --> 02:57:14.720]  democrats and republicans because if you elect a democratic republican you get
[02:57:14.720 --> 02:57:19.520]  the party with it no matter what anybody says would you take
[02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:23.920]  would you consider taking in position in a trump administration
[02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:29.920]  i probably doubt that because i like bernie sanders endorsing hillary i
[02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:33.840]  don't ever want to lose my integrity and become part of those two parties in

[03:01:09.680 --> 03:01:14.720]  let's go ahead and talk to james and georgia you're on the air go ahead
[03:01:14.720 --> 03:01:18.880]  alex uh thank you for all your work over the years
[03:01:18.880 --> 03:01:23.600]  so i wanted to set this up first with a long time inside baseball
[03:01:23.600 --> 03:01:27.680]  political family grandfather good friends with jfk
[03:01:27.680 --> 03:01:31.920]  he was a businessman like trump and then turned politicians united people
[03:01:31.920 --> 03:01:36.880]  my father special forces trained in moat yards uh was sure your phone scrambled
[03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:39.360]  a little bit back off your phone a little bit
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:45.760]  oh i'm sorry anyway um father special forces trained moat yards
[03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:49.760]  you know save lives things like that went to killer uh no audience on baseball
[03:01:49.760 --> 03:01:53.600]  first of all i want to say that uh this is special because
[03:01:53.600 --> 03:01:56.080]  it's the first time since the constitution was created i believe
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:01:59.840]  that someone's been self-funded second of all people should look instead of
[03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:02.320]  who's endorsing trump to who's against him
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:05.280]  everybody's against him except the american voters
[03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:08.880]  and third of all trump everything is hollow
[03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:12.880]  until we address the problem of the war against the families and that's the
[03:02:12.880 --> 03:02:16.960]  divorce court and allowing children to only be raised by the state
[03:02:16.960 --> 03:02:20.800]  absolutely everything is about destroying families and breaking things up
[03:02:20.800 --> 03:02:24.880]  i've even talked to people in the system the psychologists the social workers
[03:02:24.880 --> 03:02:28.560]  they say it's screwed up and his anti-family uh and his
[03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:31.280]  anti-father in fact i'm friends with one of the guys that
[03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:34.560]  actually got the father's you know uh bill of rights
[03:02:34.560 --> 03:02:38.000]  and father's rights put in in texas it's now leading the country
[03:02:38.000 --> 03:02:42.480]  uh and it's just amazing to see that even the insiders
[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:48.320]  who have phd's realize it's designed to destroy everybody great point
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:52.400]  and i just want to say to uh uh james before
[03:02:52.400 --> 03:02:56.480]  harrison i love you son i've seen you in years and i'm still fighting for you
[03:02:56.480 --> 03:03:00.960]  buddy and uh trump everything's hollow put in an executive order or
[03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:04.960]  something where it makes it a god-given right that a parent
[03:03:04.960 --> 03:03:08.320]  has to their child absolutely well the state's coming in saying
[03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:11.840]  your kids belong to the state and statistically the state is the worst
[03:03:11.840 --> 03:03:16.000]  parent you can have uh and i said there aren't some good people in the state
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:19.600]  but i mean overall look at history uh let's look look at all these foreign
[03:03:19.600 --> 03:03:22.640]  run orphanages russia the rest of them give me a break
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:26.800]  mark in kansas you're on the air world wide go ahead
[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:30.800]  yes thanks so much for the opportunity out like a first-time call from cana
[03:03:30.800 --> 03:03:34.640]  city and i'm answering to uh something i read uh
[03:03:34.640 --> 03:03:38.160]  from paul joseph watts and quoting him directly
[03:03:38.160 --> 03:03:42.000]  the editorial's back telling us sir you want a headset too because all these
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:45.840]  calls are overblown i'm sorry i'm not on a speakerphone
[03:03:45.840 --> 03:03:50.720]  and maybe uh i will back off the microphone yeah go ahead
[03:03:50.720 --> 03:03:55.280]  that help yeah go ahead i think paul joseph watson's article
[03:03:55.280 --> 03:03:58.640]  the editorial panic tone again illustrates how not just a republican
[03:03:58.640 --> 03:04:03.360]  establishment but the neoliberal global elite is absolutely petrified at the
[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:06.240]  prospect of a trump presidency no no i agree
[03:04:06.240 --> 03:04:09.200]  there's care to death of him they're trying to stop him but we got to keep
[03:04:09.200 --> 03:04:12.640]  him honest as well and influencing like when he came out for refugees because
[03:04:12.640 --> 03:04:15.360]  he didn't know they were a bunch of terrorists and he came out against i
[03:04:15.360 --> 03:04:18.560]  liked the fact that he said when he got more info he changed his view it's
[03:04:18.560 --> 03:04:20.800]  okay to change your view when you get more info
[03:04:20.800 --> 03:04:24.240]  if you don't just flip flop because of political money that's the difference
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:27.840]  in doing what the people want what's constitutional that's where i want to see
[03:04:27.840 --> 03:04:32.000]  you change and and the reason they're petrified
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:35.120]  is that they don't want to be exposed further as you've done such a great
[03:04:35.120 --> 03:04:38.720]  example and you and others now all of you have done it brother thank you mark

[03:09:30.480 --> 03:09:33.600]  you know owning a house stuff breaks having to deal with stuff you learn
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:37.120]  what christ said lay down your possessions and follow me
[03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:41.600]  but the modern world we're so enslaved to technocracy and machines and
[03:09:41.600 --> 03:09:45.440]  computers they have their dark side i spend all my time just
[03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:49.920]  jacking with property this is all property here to run this operation
[03:09:49.920 --> 03:09:54.240]  gotta pay taxes on it gotta get inspected gotta get harassed
[03:09:54.240 --> 03:09:58.720]  nothing sounds better than a little three room log cabin out in the middle of
[03:09:58.720 --> 03:10:02.400]  the woods somewhere by babbling river
[03:10:02.400 --> 03:10:06.000]  and you know four or five changes of clothes and
[03:10:06.000 --> 03:10:12.320]  a simple life but so many people never become a celebrity or successful or
[03:10:12.320 --> 03:10:15.680]  you know become a household name and so they think it's like some unknown
[03:10:15.680 --> 03:10:21.360]  country that if you could get there you would be fulfilled
[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:24.720]  the truth is i was never a very narcissistic or worldly person
[03:10:24.720 --> 03:10:27.840]  i'm a very aggressive and confident that comes off as arrogant narcissistic
[03:10:27.840 --> 03:10:30.960]  it's not i'm committed
[03:10:31.840 --> 03:10:36.080]  but i just wish people knew how much hollywood didn't matter
[03:10:36.080 --> 03:10:39.920]  how much the power structure doesn't matter
[03:10:39.920 --> 03:10:43.600]  like i almost don't even want to go out to hollywood meet with chris carter
[03:10:43.600 --> 03:10:46.320]  even though i like him and he says he's a listener and likes me and says nice
[03:10:46.320 --> 03:10:49.520]  things i want to find out about the cia in him that's why i'm excited
[03:10:49.520 --> 03:10:54.080]  not oh hey maybe i'll do a cameo on your show don't care
[03:10:54.080 --> 03:10:58.000]  and i'm not bragging about this i'm saying people literally freak out and
[03:10:58.000 --> 03:11:04.000]  fall down on their faces around movie stars
[03:11:04.000 --> 03:11:07.200]  but it's all hollow
[03:11:07.200 --> 03:11:12.560]  and i've noticed i'm talking to a lot of hollywood stars and people
[03:11:12.560 --> 03:11:16.080]  incredibly beautiful women want to have sex with them but they don't even want
[03:11:16.080 --> 03:11:20.000]  anything from them or to marry them they want them run to the next star
[03:11:20.000 --> 03:11:25.120]  as if they're collecting worth from it they don't even know how they could get
[03:11:25.120 --> 03:11:29.280]  something out of it it's like it's so empty it's so stupid
[03:11:29.280 --> 03:11:33.520]  it's so mindless it's like all these women show up i use them as the example
[03:11:33.520 --> 03:11:37.200]  off buses and airplanes every day beautiful beauty queens
[03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:41.200]  but once they get to la there's all these beauty queens
[03:11:43.120 --> 03:11:48.000]  and they
[03:11:49.200 --> 03:11:54.000]  want to be fulfilled and even if they get in hollywood movies they're not
[03:11:54.000 --> 03:11:57.360]  fulfilled that's like one out of a thousand the others all get into porn
[03:11:57.360 --> 03:12:01.600]  and they're not fulfilled but they just keep searching the new world order the
[03:12:01.600 --> 03:12:05.920]  system the bottomless pit thinking somewhere down there is the answer
[03:12:05.920 --> 03:12:10.240]  when the answer was in their heart and their soul in their mind the whole time
[03:12:10.240 --> 03:12:13.440]  nico just ran in with the wall street journal article trump reverses his
[03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:16.880]  stance on torture g.o.p frontrunner had faced criticism from military and
[03:12:16.880 --> 03:12:22.080]  legit experts that first comment see that makes me like him more
[03:12:22.080 --> 03:12:25.280]  because that's not flip-flopping that's him getting informed
[03:12:25.280 --> 03:12:29.680]  and what's crazy is stuff i relay to him and and the media matters picks up on
[03:12:29.680 --> 03:12:33.280]  this and stuff but it's just true i know for a fact in person
[03:12:33.280 --> 03:12:37.280]  and off air a lot of stuff's been relayed to trump for me
[03:12:37.280 --> 03:12:40.880]  and i know for a fact certain little birdies told him yesterday and today
[03:12:40.880 --> 03:12:44.160]  stop promoting torture you don't understand it doesn't get good answers
[03:12:44.160 --> 03:12:47.200]  he goes yeah but they're gonna bomb a building and we can find the bombs people
[03:12:47.200 --> 03:12:50.000]  sold him on and he goes oh i get it
[03:12:50.000 --> 03:12:54.400]  trump is really somebody who you can actually inform and who means well
[03:12:54.400 --> 03:12:57.920]  and that's why they're so scared of him is they know they've got his phones tapped
[03:12:57.920 --> 03:13:02.400]  they know who he is they know he's a big crazy teddy bearer who loves women and
[03:13:02.400 --> 03:13:07.200]  loves succession and he's not evil donald trump's not evil
[03:13:07.200 --> 03:13:11.040]  and so they're scared of him because they think he's got a heart just like
[03:13:11.040 --> 03:13:15.840]  ronald reagan g.o.p frontrunner has faced criticism
[03:13:15.840 --> 03:13:19.040]  leading g.o.p president of county donald trump said today he wouldn't order the
[03:13:19.040 --> 03:13:22.480]  u.s military to break international laws addressing criticism for military
[03:13:22.480 --> 03:13:24.800]  and legal experts of his policies regarding torture
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:28.560]  and killing the family members of terrorists would violate the Geneva convention
[03:13:28.560 --> 03:13:31.760]  see that's why ventura went from a week ago saying he wouldn't run against trump
[03:13:31.760 --> 03:13:35.600]  saying i'm ready to you could say oh ventura won't win
[03:13:35.600 --> 03:13:39.360]  he'll get enough votes in a third party to deep six trump
[03:13:39.360 --> 03:13:43.120]  so trump needs to be cozying up to ventura right now
[03:13:43.120 --> 03:13:47.440]  i know all the inside baseball on that we shouldn't get into it on air
[03:13:47.440 --> 03:13:50.480]  mr trump in a statement to the wall street journal said he would use every
[03:13:50.480 --> 03:13:54.160]  legal power but i have to stop these terrorist enemies i do however stand at
[03:13:54.160 --> 03:13:57.200]  the united states is bound by laws and treaties and i will not order our
[03:13:57.200 --> 03:14:00.320]  military other officials to violate those laws
[03:14:00.320 --> 03:14:04.480]  and he goes on so boom i just went from like you know i was like 98 percent for
[03:14:04.480 --> 03:14:08.560]  trump to like 90 percent over this and then the cfr thing i was like 85 and i'm
[03:14:08.560 --> 03:14:11.040]  being honest about that just like knight was against
[03:14:11.040 --> 03:14:14.720]  steven fernabeski and for him on the vaccines and everything else and
[03:14:14.720 --> 03:14:20.000]  being against naftan and tpp and globalism and these bad trade deals you
[03:14:20.000 --> 03:14:23.120]  know knight was going for him the knights you know who starts going i don't
[03:14:23.120 --> 03:14:25.840]  know i mean we're just going to be completely transparent here
[03:14:25.840 --> 03:14:30.640]  we're not in some cult of trump folks but the whole power structures against
[03:14:30.640 --> 03:14:35.200]  him these aren't flip-flops this is him being smart
[03:14:35.200 --> 03:14:37.920]  a flip-flops when you get one group pays you to say something and then you
[03:14:37.920 --> 03:14:42.000]  change it or you say i'm not going to come after your guns and you do or you
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:45.760]  say obama care is free when you know the thing increases prices
[03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:51.440]  that's lying that's scamming he says he will abolish it he's put his plan out
[03:14:51.440 --> 03:14:54.720]  it's a great plan so trump goes on so good job
[03:14:54.720 --> 03:14:57.760]  bravo to trump that is super news we'll go to david night in a moment and your
[03:14:57.760 --> 03:15:00.880]  phone calls and a lot more
[03:15:00.960 --> 03:15:05.520]  and boy he's got a full slate so get ready but that is a very very very very
[03:15:05.520 --> 03:15:08.400]  very positive point the reason i talk about myself here on eras
[03:15:08.400 --> 03:15:12.720]  that's my gauge for how i see the world and i just want people to know where i
[03:15:12.720 --> 03:15:17.280]  stand uh on all of this but but
[03:15:17.280 --> 03:15:22.240]  i don't see the cfr reaching out to him and getting rich reaching out to him
[03:15:22.240 --> 03:15:25.200]  and saying nice things
[03:15:25.440 --> 03:15:28.880]  as oh my gosh he sold out that's the power structure
[03:15:28.880 --> 03:15:34.400]  trying good cop when bad cop's not working and so that's my view on that
[03:15:34.400 --> 03:15:37.600]  and it shows what a serious threat he is
[03:15:37.600 --> 03:15:41.520]  they know stealing the election in front of everybody at the primary
[03:15:41.520 --> 03:15:44.560]  is going to blow up and they know doing it at the convention is going to do it
[03:15:44.560 --> 03:15:49.040]  that's why i've never been more excited i've never been on more on edge
[03:15:49.040 --> 03:15:52.800]  i hear people saying they're bored
[03:15:52.960 --> 03:15:55.920]  north korea took the nuclear triggers off two days ago that they just shot a
[03:15:55.920 --> 03:15:59.440]  missile over japan they're threatened to attack they're run by a psychopath
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:04.240]  hereditary dictator russia is moving missiles around i mean all
[03:16:04.240 --> 03:16:07.120]  hell is breaking loose saudi arabia is threatening to attack
[03:16:07.120 --> 03:16:11.040]  russia i mean this is an incredible time to be alive and they go i don't fear
[03:16:11.040 --> 03:16:14.720]  monger i'm not fear mongering i'm saying we don't need john kasek was
[03:16:14.720 --> 03:16:18.160]  little friendly man speeches saying let's attack russia
[03:16:18.160 --> 03:16:22.000]  no kasek let's not do that
[03:16:23.520 --> 03:16:29.120]  i don't get what it is about wimps wanting to start wars all the time
[03:16:30.720 --> 03:16:35.840]  i hadn't been in any wars but i've i broke some jaws
[03:16:37.200 --> 03:16:40.240]  and i've defended myself the people that tubes up their noses and can't talk
[03:16:40.240 --> 03:16:43.680]  ever again very good and i'll just tell you i'm not proud of that even though i
[03:16:43.680 --> 03:16:48.080]  defended my life has kasek ever grabbed somebody's
[03:16:48.080 --> 03:16:51.920]  head and bounced it in the concrete three times
[03:16:53.120 --> 03:16:56.160]  didn't john kasek ever punch somebody and broke their jaw or punch somebody's
[03:16:56.160 --> 03:17:00.720]  nose right off their face no and he sure hadn't run into houses
[03:17:00.720 --> 03:17:05.680]  where people are shooting at you like somebody i know in delta force
[03:17:05.680 --> 03:17:08.960]  and you get shot at and you throw a hand grenade in and you go in there's 15
[03:17:08.960 --> 03:17:11.840]  children blowing all over the walls that's why guys like that don't want
[03:17:11.840 --> 03:17:14.320]  to start wars for nothing because they've been there
[03:17:14.320 --> 03:17:17.440]  and i'm sick of wimps trying to start wars constantly
[03:17:17.440 --> 03:17:22.000]  i'm gonna hand the baton to david night i'm gonna say this i got so

[03:19:12.960 --> 03:19:16.240]  see the persecution of patriot grips they could just start arresting people
[03:19:16.240 --> 03:19:19.440]  forever saying you know that they supported the bounties and support
[03:19:19.440 --> 03:19:22.240]  private property you got that going on but first
[03:19:22.240 --> 03:19:25.920]  trump what do you make of that circus that bloodbath
[03:19:25.920 --> 03:19:28.800]  it was like gladiator the movie where they just keep putting everybody up
[03:19:28.800 --> 03:19:32.720]  against him ganging up on him yeah you know with the five lions and you know
[03:19:32.720 --> 03:19:36.160]  tigers and everything else and the top gladiator can't beat him
[03:19:36.160 --> 03:19:39.600]  meghan kelly was like channeling a satanic spirit she was beautiful but
[03:19:39.600 --> 03:19:44.240]  look like the essential evil beautiful witch like she wanted to murder
[03:19:44.240 --> 03:19:49.040]  trump uh just a power trip of these people uh the
[03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:52.640]  demonization and now trump coming out against torture because
[03:19:52.640 --> 03:19:55.760]  pretty clear if somebody's wife like and sambernadino
[03:19:55.760 --> 03:19:58.960]  is aiding and abetting is connected say we're gonna arrest you we're gonna
[03:19:58.960 --> 03:20:01.520]  prosecute you we're gonna lock you in prison
[03:20:01.520 --> 03:20:04.800]  that's incentive enough and say we're gonna kill your wife okay i get trump
[03:20:04.800 --> 03:20:09.280]  statement okay but you don't codify it you don't put it into law
[03:20:09.280 --> 03:20:13.280]  you don't engage in things like that and let's just not lie torture is part of
[03:20:13.280 --> 03:20:16.720]  war it happens you don't condone it you don't push it it
[03:20:16.720 --> 03:20:20.400]  happens here and there you sure don't light it up in christmas tree lights like
[03:20:20.400 --> 03:20:23.840]  it's a great thing david night i mean this is just
[03:20:23.840 --> 03:20:27.440]  such a battle between good and evil right now i've never seen
[03:20:27.440 --> 03:20:31.280]  such an amazing time to be alive i just can't it's just it's incredible
[03:20:31.280 --> 03:20:34.880]  it's incredible alex you know this deeply disturbed me to hear donald trump
[03:20:34.880 --> 03:20:38.640]  talking about uh bringing back the enhanced interrogation
[03:20:38.640 --> 03:20:43.760]  as the bush administration called it and it's incredibly disingenuous for
[03:20:43.760 --> 03:20:48.160]  people like michael hayden who was bush's cia director
[03:20:48.160 --> 03:20:51.120]  when this stuff was going on running the whole thing back yeah to come back and
[03:20:51.120 --> 03:20:54.320]  say hey you know this is a violation of international law and
[03:20:54.320 --> 03:20:58.240]  try to take the moral high ground it was a trap by the neocons
[03:20:58.240 --> 03:21:02.400]  who were coming after donald trump uh and he he walked into it but now he's
[03:21:02.400 --> 03:21:05.520]  pulled it back i'm glad to see that he says look we understand
[03:21:05.520 --> 03:21:09.200]  this is against international law it's a violation of the janiva convention it
[03:21:09.200 --> 03:21:11.760]  should be we executed people for doing water torture
[03:21:11.760 --> 03:21:15.760]  to our troops after world war two this is not a way to get information it
[03:21:15.760 --> 03:21:19.360]  doesn't work it puts us on the side of evil
[03:21:19.360 --> 03:21:23.520]  and you don't torture suspects that's the key they want us to do it so they can
[03:21:23.520 --> 03:21:26.240]  get rid of all of our due process and do it to the patriots
[03:21:26.240 --> 03:21:30.160]  they would love to be waterboarding uh the bundes right now guaranteed
[03:21:30.160 --> 03:21:32.880]  oh absolutely and we look at somebody like michael hayden and they say well
[03:21:32.880 --> 03:21:36.320]  he's a gop hawk and he's putting this out there let's understand
[03:21:36.320 --> 03:21:40.320]  michael hayden was appointed to the head of the nsa by bill clinton
[03:21:40.320 --> 03:21:43.600]  and let's go further let's go further that little pansy
[03:21:43.600 --> 03:21:47.040]  is was a quarterback of torture and illegal spying yeah so for him to think
[03:21:47.040 --> 03:21:50.000]  the public's dumb and flip and then act like trump's bad
[03:21:50.000 --> 03:21:52.880]  i actually liked trump being honest about torture
[03:21:52.880 --> 03:21:56.240]  yes i mean that's why he's better than him he doesn't sneak around and do it
[03:21:56.240 --> 03:22:00.080]  see because he thinks it's okay exactly you got the people who actually did it
[03:22:00.080 --> 03:22:02.720]  now claiming that they have the moral high ground say well
[03:22:02.720 --> 03:22:06.400]  we would refuse orders i'm going to talk about what's going on with these people
[03:22:06.400 --> 03:22:10.160]  and what's going on in the wake of the uh all the people being arrested across
[03:22:10.160 --> 03:22:13.280]  the country as well as this special agent who was in
[03:22:13.280 --> 03:22:17.360]  charge there dan love i've got multiple articles from across
[03:22:17.360 --> 03:22:21.200]  utah and nevada sheriffs who are complaining about him
[03:22:21.200 --> 03:22:24.560]  county commissioners who are complaining about dan love the guy who ran this
[03:22:24.560 --> 03:22:28.400]  and i have to say what at what point are citizens
[03:22:28.400 --> 03:22:31.920]  allowed to stand up and disobey illegal well david they were pointing guns at
[03:22:31.920 --> 03:22:35.840]  you yes they're in it you know in a ravine on the side of the highway saying
[03:22:35.840 --> 03:22:40.160]  don't walk forward is press you walk forward fox news did too i wonder if
[03:22:40.160 --> 03:22:42.480]  they're gonna arrest you but leave fox news alone because you dare name a
[03:22:42.480 --> 03:22:44.400]  camera at them they've arrested david bundy for that
[03:22:44.400 --> 03:22:46.640]  yeah exactly that's what they did with david bundy
[03:22:46.640 --> 03:22:50.800]  look they put up a first amendment area that's something that even the governor
[03:22:50.800 --> 03:22:53.280]  of nevada complained about they will arrest him
[03:22:53.280 --> 03:22:56.960]  yeah exactly the first man amendment is not an area
[03:22:56.960 --> 03:23:00.560]  uh you don't get you don't get a that's been adjudicated hundreds of times and
[03:23:00.560 --> 03:23:03.680]  that's why the feds are going to get greedy they won their battle
[03:23:03.680 --> 03:23:07.120]  out in oregon now these leftists that running are licking their chops they
[03:23:07.120 --> 03:23:10.960]  want to start some jihad against us it's sick speaking of hayden
[03:23:10.960 --> 03:23:15.200]  uh the little grimy creature uh let's go ahead and go to this guy
[03:23:15.200 --> 03:23:18.480]  you know talking about he has the moral high ground against torture
[03:23:18.480 --> 03:23:22.560]  no he ordered people to do it and when they got caught he sent him to prison
[03:23:22.560 --> 03:23:26.000]  he's ten times worse than trump go ahead yeah oh exactly
[03:23:26.000 --> 03:23:29.920]  absolutely what do you think about a president trump and so or any of these
[03:23:29.920 --> 03:23:33.920]  republicans and some of the stuff they say that strikes me is crazy
[03:23:33.920 --> 03:23:39.040]  i would be incredibly concerned if a president trump
[03:23:39.040 --> 03:23:43.280]  governed in a way that was consistent with the language that
[03:23:43.280 --> 03:23:48.160]  candidate trump expressed during the campaign
[03:23:50.880 --> 03:23:54.400]  if i was casting for a perv that's not hard hollywood
[03:23:54.400 --> 03:23:58.400]  we're gonna do waterboarding and a whole lot more because they deserve it
[03:23:58.400 --> 03:24:02.000]  not be you know look we did we did what about killing the terrorist families
[03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:05.280]  families oh my god let me give you a push i mean that never even occurred to
[03:24:05.280 --> 03:24:08.480]  you right i mean you god no yeah oh that's bull that tortured
[03:24:08.480 --> 03:24:12.240]  families you're a real badass you're a liar you're a real badass
[03:24:12.240 --> 03:24:16.400]  of course you were funny buddy if he were to order that
[03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:20.720]  once in government the american armed forces would refuse to act
[03:24:20.720 --> 03:24:24.080]  what oh well that's no they followed your orders
[03:24:24.080 --> 03:24:27.440]  that it's it's i thought the whole thing was and then when they got caught you'd
[03:24:27.440 --> 03:24:31.040]  let him go to prison you cannot you're not committed you're not required in
[03:24:31.040 --> 03:24:35.360]  fact you're i just can't stand to see this guy from what i've heard him say
[03:24:35.360 --> 03:24:39.280]  and now he's saying you don't follow illegal orders let me tell you we have
[03:24:39.280 --> 03:24:42.880]  we says you don't follow illegal orders we had a
[03:24:42.880 --> 03:24:46.400]  a speech that he gave at washington he's saying that because they have
[03:24:46.400 --> 03:24:49.680]  they have tortured warrants he says you don't do it because they deserve it you
[03:24:49.680 --> 03:24:52.640]  do it because you need to well let me tell you you know going back he was
[03:24:52.640 --> 03:24:56.320]  also he was not only cia but he was in essay and he was speaking at washington
[03:24:56.320 --> 03:24:59.600]  lee university to the legal people there and we have we've covered this in the
[03:24:59.600 --> 03:25:03.200]  past we still have this clip and he says to the students there he said
[03:25:03.200 --> 03:25:06.720]  oh you know we're talking about whatever it is section 123 of the
[03:25:06.720 --> 03:25:09.760]  of the code to spy on people after 9 11 he goes
[03:25:09.760 --> 03:25:13.360]  i didn't need 123 i didn't need any stinking
[03:25:13.360 --> 03:25:17.840]  law from the congress i had a direct order from the president and he got
[03:25:17.840 --> 03:25:21.040]  you know in their face about that it's like oh really you don't need the
[03:25:21.040 --> 03:25:25.840]  constitution michael hayden and i'm not against a feminine men
[03:25:25.840 --> 03:25:30.240]  okay that's fine my issue is why is it always these weird
[03:25:30.240 --> 03:25:35.760]  effeminate men who you would expect to see you know with a gay cocktail bar
[03:25:35.760 --> 03:25:39.440]  why is it always them talking about tough guys and killing and murder and all
[03:25:39.440 --> 03:25:43.120]  this yeah well here's the thing that this guy
[03:25:43.120 --> 03:25:47.440]  represented himself as a libertarian on stage with a judge napolitano
[03:25:47.440 --> 03:25:50.560]  and the moderator as well as judge napolitano and the audience looked at
[03:25:50.560 --> 03:25:54.240]  him like why he goes yeah like uh judge napolitano i'm a libertarian too and
[03:25:54.240 --> 03:25:58.000]  it's like you're joking this is a guy who says he doesn't care about the
[03:25:58.000 --> 03:26:00.960]  constitution he doesn't care about the laws that congress passes because
[03:26:00.960 --> 03:26:04.080]  well now he's a chameleon because he knows how popular libertarianism so
[03:26:04.080 --> 03:26:06.640]  that's the goodness what do you make of the stunning club let's get it ready
[03:26:06.640 --> 03:26:09.440]  and we're gonna go to break i'm gonna punch out and let you take over
[03:26:09.440 --> 03:26:13.120]  genridge coming out and saying secret society's the elite he's not part of it
[03:26:13.120 --> 03:26:16.880]  channeling yours truly this shows how the liberty movement has taken
[03:26:16.880 --> 03:26:20.400]  over that now genridge a consummate globalist he's i love
[03:26:20.400 --> 03:26:24.800]  oh yeah it is now a chameleon role let's play that club
[03:26:24.800 --> 03:26:28.080]  and now they're faced with a very real prospect of donald trump
[03:26:28.080 --> 03:26:31.840]  becoming the leader of the party and it absolutely drives him crazy
[03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:35.920]  they just cannot imagine sharing well because he's an outsider he's not them
[03:26:35.920 --> 03:26:39.040]  he's not part of the club he's uncontrollable
[03:26:39.040 --> 03:26:42.240]  uh you know he hasn't been through the initiation rights he didn't belong to
[03:26:42.240 --> 03:26:46.400]  the secret society um and i think that they they don't see him
[03:26:46.400 --> 03:26:50.880]  they'd have no idea how to relate to him and i grew up in dallas texas in the
[03:26:50.880 --> 03:26:55.360]  richest county rock wall because i was good looking from a good family
[03:26:55.360 --> 03:26:59.040]  i had multiple rich groups i mean billionaire groups i was in high school
[03:26:59.040 --> 03:27:01.680]  trying to recruit me into secret societies so again rich is saying that
[03:27:01.680 --> 03:27:05.040]  folks let me explain something in most of these circles there are all these
[03:27:05.040 --> 03:27:09.280]  there's a conopte gone of secret societies that are feeder groups into
[03:27:09.280 --> 03:27:13.440]  the illuminati as you saw with the scalia and so what he's
[03:27:13.440 --> 03:27:16.480]  saying there is real for me david i want to ask this question
[03:27:16.480 --> 03:27:19.440]  how big is it that they're talking that clearly now
[03:27:19.440 --> 03:27:23.840]  about reality what's really happening here well alex just as uh we were talking
[03:27:23.840 --> 03:27:26.880]  about michael hayden calling himself a libertarian i can remember 25 years ago
[03:27:26.880 --> 03:27:30.320]  when i was working in a libertarian party nobody even knew what that word was
[03:27:30.320 --> 03:27:34.080]  you talk to people they would say a librarian party whatever we don't
[03:27:34.080 --> 03:27:37.680]  understand what that is so it's become part of the vernacular
[03:27:37.680 --> 03:27:41.200]  and the idea the understanding i should say not the idea but the understanding
[03:27:41.200 --> 03:27:44.800]  that we have a secret goblas cabal i've said the gop needs to rename itself the
[03:27:44.800 --> 03:27:47.840]  globalist oligarch party because that's what they really are
[03:27:47.840 --> 03:27:51.520]  that has uh become people have woken up to that as well and so when we see
[03:27:51.520 --> 03:27:54.640]  gingrich talking about this to me i i think he's
[03:27:54.640 --> 03:27:58.080]  inoculating himself by this i think he's positioning himself i don't think
[03:27:58.080 --> 03:28:00.400]  he's on our side anymore than i think michael hayden is
[03:28:00.400 --> 03:28:05.600]  not gay old pedophiles i don't think that this is genuine even
[03:28:05.600 --> 03:28:09.600]  more than i think uh that hayden is genuine but they both understand
[03:28:09.600 --> 03:28:12.960]  that these uh that people understand people have woken up
[03:28:12.960 --> 03:28:16.160]  understand what the libertarian movement is about they know what libertarians
[03:28:16.160 --> 03:28:19.920]  are now they know about these secret societies and so they try to inoculate
[03:28:19.920 --> 03:28:23.600]  themselves from it by talking about it i'm concerned
[03:28:23.600 --> 03:28:27.520]  i still believe that senator sessions has more sway
[03:28:27.520 --> 03:28:30.800]  with the donald trump camp he's been working with them since i want sessions
[03:28:30.800 --> 03:28:33.920]  we need to push for sessions to be the vp yeah but i'm going to say they put
[03:28:33.920 --> 03:28:36.560]  gingrich in there i did not like stone earlier saying that
[03:28:36.560 --> 03:28:39.760]  yeah i'm concerned about the richard hoff stuff and remember
[03:28:39.760 --> 03:28:43.440]  uh it was ronald reagan who was the first president for a long long time i
[03:28:43.440 --> 03:28:46.560]  think since the cfr been created that wasn't a
[03:28:46.560 --> 03:28:49.600]  a cfr member people can check me on the facts of that nevertheless
[03:28:49.600 --> 03:28:54.640]  ronald reagan was not a member but when he got in he appointed uh was 350 360
[03:28:54.640 --> 03:28:56.960]  people from the cfr throughout the state department
[03:28:56.960 --> 03:29:01.440]  so we have to be aware that we have to uh be speaking about that to make that
[03:29:01.440 --> 03:29:04.240]  part of the absolutely david i'm going to throw the baton to you

[03:30:09.200 --> 03:30:12.880]  newt gingrich explaining why the republican establishment is so scared of
[03:30:12.880 --> 03:30:16.160]  donald trump gingrich would know about secret societies
[03:30:16.160 --> 03:30:20.400]  given his affiliation with bohemian grove although he could also be speaking
[03:30:20.400 --> 03:30:24.720]  of the skull and bones club which is notorious for its initiation rituals
[03:30:24.720 --> 03:30:28.960]  so far trump has played the role of outsider and people are loving him for
[03:30:28.960 --> 03:30:33.200]  it but he has held private briefings with some secret society types like
[03:30:33.200 --> 03:30:37.040]  richard haas haas is the president of the council on foreign relations he's
[03:30:37.040 --> 03:30:40.000]  also a member of the influential trilateral commission

[03:33:29.040 --> 03:33:32.560]  to get to him as well and i want to talk about what's going on
[03:33:32.560 --> 03:33:35.600]  with the arrest of all these people who are supporting
[03:33:35.600 --> 03:33:39.120]  the bundes at the standoff i was there covering it
[03:33:39.120 --> 03:33:43.520]  and i've got to tell you i'm very deeply disturbed by these
[03:33:43.520 --> 03:33:46.160]  criminal complaints i saw i haven't seen the indictment but i'm assuming the
[03:33:46.160 --> 03:33:49.360]  indictment is the same as the criminal complaints
[03:33:49.360 --> 03:33:52.000]  it does not match at all with what i saw there
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:55.120]  i think this is an incredible case of government overreach and now
[03:33:55.120 --> 03:33:58.080]  they're expanding this they arrested another 12 people
[03:33:58.080 --> 03:34:01.920]  and we're going to cover that in just a moment before we do real quickly i want

[03:34:28.880 --> 03:34:31.360]  an article on info wars dot com by curt nemo
[03:34:31.360 --> 03:34:34.640]  government considers bundy supporters to be domestic terrorists he points out
[03:34:34.640 --> 03:34:37.680]  that two more of of clive and bundy's sons
[03:34:37.680 --> 03:34:41.120]  david and mel were arrested by federal agents
[03:34:41.120 --> 03:34:44.080]  yesterday they already had two sons that were arrested
[03:34:44.080 --> 03:34:47.520]  up in oregon that was amin and ryan you know quite frankly
[03:34:47.520 --> 03:34:50.800]  when i was there i i never saw david or melvin
[03:34:50.800 --> 03:34:53.920]  amin was a spokesperson he was talking to the press
[03:34:53.920 --> 03:34:59.120]  ryan was there as well david had been arrested before we got there
[03:34:59.120 --> 03:35:02.480]  he had been transported which is a very long distance over an hour
[03:35:02.480 --> 03:35:06.560]  down to los vegas because that entire area is clark county
[03:35:06.560 --> 03:35:09.520]  from los vegas all the way up to bunkerville had been transported down
[03:35:09.520 --> 03:35:13.600]  there arrested for taking pictures of these agents you know you're not allowed
[03:35:13.600 --> 03:35:17.440]  to take pictures of your masters don't look them in the eye
[03:35:17.440 --> 03:35:20.640]  because that's a threat okay you look at them in the eye you take a picture of
[03:35:20.640 --> 03:35:22.960]  them that's perceived to be a threat and of course
[03:35:22.960 --> 03:35:26.720]  that's what we're seeing in these indictments all kinds of imagined threats
[03:35:26.720 --> 03:35:29.920]  conspiracy charges to do this conspiracy charges do that
[03:35:29.920 --> 03:35:33.680]  they didn't say they hurt anybody okay the people who did hurt people the people
[03:35:33.680 --> 03:35:37.120]  who should be arrested are these blm agents nevertheless
[03:35:37.120 --> 03:35:39.920]  they transport them all the way to los vegas then they just turned them out on
[03:35:39.920 --> 03:35:43.120]  the street they didn't charge them with anything but now they have arrested him
[03:35:43.120 --> 03:35:46.800]  they're probably if they get through with these and and get these charges to
[03:35:46.800 --> 03:35:49.600]  stick in federal court they will put them in jail for decades
[03:35:49.600 --> 03:35:53.280]  they have arrested 12 people in six states and this
[03:35:53.280 --> 03:35:57.200]  statement from the us attorney daniel bogdan said in a statement this
[03:35:57.200 --> 03:36:00.640]  investigation began the day after the assault against federal law enforcement
[03:36:00.640 --> 03:36:06.240]  officers and continues to this day he said we will continue to work to
[03:36:06.240 --> 03:36:10.720]  identify the assaults and their role in the assault and the aftermath in
[03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:13.920]  order to ensure that justice is served so this is something that they
[03:36:13.920 --> 03:36:17.280]  have ongoing one of the people arrested they're making a big deal out of this
[03:36:17.280 --> 03:36:19.760]  because he was a political activist up in new hampshire
[03:36:19.760 --> 03:36:25.440]  his name is the limits he was one of the four co-chairs of an
[03:36:25.440 --> 03:36:28.960]  auxiliary group that was supporting donald trump veterans for trump in new
[03:36:28.960 --> 03:36:31.920]  hampshire it's not a formal part of the trump
[03:36:31.920 --> 03:36:36.720]  campaign but you have corporate media as curt nemo points out is making a big
[03:36:36.720 --> 03:36:40.320]  deal out of that connection now his wife is also a new hampshire state
[03:36:40.320 --> 03:36:44.480]  representative as he came out of the court as part of this indictment
[03:36:44.480 --> 03:36:47.920]  supporters were there in new hampshire they were and this is reported by the
[03:36:47.920 --> 03:36:51.920]  new hampshire union leader the crowd of supporters that were there for him were
[03:36:51.920 --> 03:36:55.120]  singing god bless america as he was let out of the courtroom today or
[03:36:55.120 --> 03:36:58.640]  yesterday supporters held hands joined in prayer just outside the door to court
[03:36:58.640 --> 03:37:02.240]  room four before declaring tyranny has come to new hampshire
[03:37:02.240 --> 03:37:05.600]  this is not my america i couldn't say it better myself
[03:37:05.600 --> 03:37:09.360]  i am absolutely outraged that people like michael hayden
[03:37:09.360 --> 03:37:14.400]  would say that uh you should disobey orders by a president to torture people
[03:37:14.400 --> 03:37:18.720]  when he presided over an institution that was uh the institution doing the
[03:37:18.720 --> 03:37:22.640]  torture calling it enhanced interrogation that kind of
[03:37:22.640 --> 03:37:26.640]  parsing of the language those kinds of lies they are masters at that and of
[03:37:26.640 --> 03:37:30.320]  course people like michael hayden who work with the nsa who work with the cia
[03:37:30.320 --> 03:37:34.800]  are masters of deception that's what this dark government is about is about
[03:37:34.800 --> 03:37:38.800]  deception and to say that these people have a right to disobey
[03:37:38.800 --> 03:37:44.000]  immoral unconstitutional laws like torture and to say that we as citizens
[03:37:44.000 --> 03:37:48.000]  don't have the right to disobey unlawful immoral unconstitutional orders from
[03:37:48.000 --> 03:37:51.120]  our government let me tell you about the man who was in
[03:37:51.120 --> 03:37:54.640]  charge of this standoff dan love here's something from the salt lake
[03:37:54.640 --> 03:37:59.280]  tribune uh this was uh back in october of 2014 public
[03:37:59.280 --> 03:38:02.480]  enemy number one for rural utah sheriffs just happens to be
[03:38:02.480 --> 03:38:06.560]  a fellow peace officer you hear that rural sheriffs
[03:38:06.560 --> 03:38:10.320]  versus a federal law enforcement agent who is that
[03:38:10.320 --> 03:38:16.240]  dan love the blm's special agent in charge elected law enforcement officers
[03:38:16.240 --> 03:38:20.320]  they say in the salt lake tribune from nefi to blanding call him an
[03:38:20.320 --> 03:38:24.480]  arrogant dishonest bully who has little regard for local authority and dodges
[03:38:24.480 --> 03:38:27.760]  accountability derailing a collaborative approach to police work
[03:38:27.760 --> 03:38:30.880]  on the state's federal lands they want to have nothing to do
[03:38:30.880 --> 03:38:35.280]  with the local law enforcement he repudiates and gets in the faces
[03:38:35.280 --> 03:38:39.440]  of the people who are elected law enforcement and elected
[03:38:39.440 --> 03:38:43.440]  county commissioners their local elected officials love reportedly just
[03:38:43.440 --> 03:38:48.000]  laughed when garfield county sheriff james denny perkins relayed ranchers
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:51.600]  complaints about federal officers removing plastic feed tubes from the
[03:38:51.600 --> 03:38:54.720]  range and threatening the ranchers with litter citations
[03:38:54.720 --> 03:38:57.680]  he drew early controversy during the undercover probe
[03:38:57.680 --> 03:39:00.960]  of artifacts trafficking and blanding in 2009
[03:39:00.960 --> 03:39:04.800]  in that particular probe you had a doctor a doctor red
[03:39:04.800 --> 03:39:08.720]  who was a local this is a small time very
[03:39:08.720 --> 03:39:13.600]  remote rural area as a senator oren hatch said to
[03:39:13.600 --> 03:39:20.480]  the department of justice eric holder so i can't really get those two in my
[03:39:20.480 --> 03:39:23.680]  mind they're such cognitive dissonance to talk about department of justice and
[03:39:23.680 --> 03:39:27.200]  eric holder but senator oren hatch from utah said to him he said
[03:39:27.200 --> 03:39:30.720]  we have such a hard time getting doctors to serve these
[03:39:30.720 --> 03:39:36.240]  remote low population rural areas this guy was deeply beloved by his community
[03:39:36.240 --> 03:39:40.960]  they came after him uh dan love came after him there was a
[03:39:40.960 --> 03:39:45.520]  bead that was half the size of a dime they valued it at
[03:39:45.520 --> 03:39:48.560]  $2,000 so they could get a felony charge for him
[03:39:48.560 --> 03:39:52.160]  they burst onto his land with over a hundred agents
[03:39:52.160 --> 03:39:56.000]  took him manhandled him put him in his garage tied him up interrogated him for
[03:39:56.000 --> 03:39:59.760]  over four hours told him his life was over his medical career was over
[03:39:59.760 --> 03:40:04.640]  and he subsequently committed suicide along with the informant who talked
[03:40:04.640 --> 03:40:08.400]  about this and two other people this is the kind of
[03:40:08.400 --> 03:40:13.920]  in-your-face iron fist that this special agent from the blm dan love is
[03:40:13.920 --> 03:40:17.520]  ruling with now i say top state officials even in utah
[03:40:17.520 --> 03:40:22.080]  want love to go this is untenable said lieutenant governor
[03:40:22.080 --> 03:40:25.600]  spencer cox there comes a time when personalities get in the way of
[03:40:25.600 --> 03:40:29.600]  productivity and for his part they say dan love is not talking
[03:40:29.600 --> 03:40:33.520]  now we have another sheriff rick eldridge of perkins and san juan county
[03:40:33.520 --> 03:40:37.840]  said rangers pull over citizens without probable cause even in areas where they
[03:40:37.840 --> 03:40:40.880]  have no jurisdiction they bully ranch hands they berate
[03:40:40.880 --> 03:40:45.280]  tourists for parking vehicles off of dirt roads and illegally closed roads
[03:40:45.280 --> 03:40:49.280]  federal officers refuse to help the searches and rescues and when they do
[03:40:49.280 --> 03:40:52.880]  they get in the way now this is what we've seen also in
[03:40:52.880 --> 03:40:56.080]  oregon of course as dan love is not up in oregon he is over
[03:40:56.080 --> 03:41:00.080]  utah and novata but we have seen this in oregon as well
[03:41:00.080 --> 03:41:03.840]  that's why we had the sheriff up there in grant county
[03:41:03.840 --> 03:41:08.800]  palmer who was trying to help the people in his area now they're coming after
[03:41:08.800 --> 03:41:12.320]  that sheriff they're trying to get his law enforcement credentials removed
[03:41:12.320 --> 03:41:15.920]  that's what happens when sheriffs stand up to this kind of tyranny from the
[03:41:15.920 --> 03:41:18.720]  federal government we got a piute county sheriff those reported a couple of
[03:41:18.720 --> 03:41:22.160]  days ago talking about the forest service personnel
[03:41:22.160 --> 03:41:26.160]  and he says if i have to i'm going to deputize every man woman and child in
[03:41:26.160 --> 03:41:29.840]  this county to stop these people what do we do when they come
[03:41:29.840 --> 03:41:35.680]  against our elected officials there was a ride of atvs in a park area that was
[03:41:35.680 --> 03:41:39.920]  shut down by dan love they called it the recapture ride because it was in i
[03:41:39.920 --> 03:41:43.680]  think a recapture canyon this is an area who had atvs
[03:41:43.680 --> 03:41:47.840]  and this has been promoted been done for many many years a trail where they
[03:41:47.840 --> 03:41:51.520]  allow them to ride the atvs through these vast
[03:41:51.520 --> 03:41:55.520]  vast number of acres that the government claims that they own
[03:41:55.520 --> 03:42:00.480]  and it's being ruled by this guy dan love is if he was a sheriff of nottingham
[03:42:00.480 --> 03:42:04.240]  and as they were writing these uh they did a protest and this is really
[03:42:04.240 --> 03:42:07.520]  more than anything about jurisdictional conflicts this is uh
[03:42:07.520 --> 03:42:11.120]  led by some county commissioners but they had hundreds of people there
[03:42:11.120 --> 03:42:15.280]  they arrested five people for this protest ride through the canyon
[03:42:15.280 --> 03:42:18.960]  one of those five people was one of the outspoken daughters of the doctor
[03:42:18.960 --> 03:42:23.520]  and of course the doctor himself had been charged previously with some crimes
[03:42:23.520 --> 03:42:26.960]  he had won in court this is a pattern of behavior we've seen
[03:42:26.960 --> 03:42:29.600]  over and over again with these people from the federal government
[03:42:29.600 --> 03:42:33.520]  they come after somebody with a ridiculous charge uh they lose in court
[03:42:33.520 --> 03:42:37.440]  and then it becomes a multi-year vendetta for them until they get even and
[03:42:37.440 --> 03:42:41.520]  that's what we're now seeing in the bundy ranch standoff
[03:42:41.520 --> 03:42:44.320]  one of the people one of the county commissioners who was part of that
[03:42:44.320 --> 03:42:49.280]  recapture ride that protest ride uh was that the blm came after him
[03:42:49.280 --> 03:42:53.920]  tried to get a 16 month sentence against him jail term 16 months
[03:42:53.920 --> 03:42:57.440]  although the maximum sentence would have been 12 months they tried for 16
[03:42:57.440 --> 03:43:02.720]  months instead they got 10 days but they charged him a fine of 96
[03:43:02.720 --> 03:43:06.320]  thousand dollars claiming that there was damage done
[03:43:06.320 --> 03:43:11.360]  to government land and that he was ultimately responsible for this we've
[03:43:11.360 --> 03:43:14.320]  even had other special agents in charge from the
[03:43:14.320 --> 03:43:17.120]  bureau of land management complained about this steve martin
[03:43:17.120 --> 03:43:20.960]  talking about what happened at the bundy ranch said he was listening to details
[03:43:20.960 --> 03:43:24.480]  of a clandestine operation in arizona he's based in arizona
[03:43:24.480 --> 03:43:28.080]  he said he was listening to details in the federal law enforcement training
[03:43:28.080 --> 03:43:32.960]  center in artesia new mexico and he said the plan was full of undue
[03:43:32.960 --> 03:43:36.560]  unduly optimistic bravado and it lacked a key
[03:43:36.560 --> 03:43:41.200]  ingredient cooperation with the county sheriff and he said i remember thinking
[03:43:41.200 --> 03:43:45.920]  is this still the blm this is something that has been going on since 1978 at
[03:43:45.920 --> 03:43:48.960]  that time they got their first 15 agents they dressed them like park rangers
[03:43:48.960 --> 03:43:51.120]  they gave them pistols but then throughout the 80s
[03:43:51.120 --> 03:43:54.640]  they began militarizing this organization and we have to understand
[03:43:54.640 --> 03:43:59.840]  as ron paul has said if they get these weapons if they militarize themselves
[03:43:59.840 --> 03:44:02.960]  they're going to use it against you and we've seen this now with the department
[03:44:02.960 --> 03:44:05.760]  of education doing swat teams against people
[03:44:05.760 --> 03:44:10.000]  that are behind in their student loans it is absolutely amazing
[03:44:10.000 --> 03:44:13.600]  you have to understand that the paraphrase pastor martin neemuler
[03:44:13.600 --> 03:44:16.160]  who said you know first they came for this group then they came for that one
[03:44:16.160 --> 03:44:19.280]  first they came for the miners and nobody did anything about that then they
[03:44:19.280 --> 03:44:21.280]  came after the loggers and people said well
[03:44:21.280 --> 03:44:25.760]  i would rather let the forest burn than to let these people earn a living
[03:44:25.760 --> 03:44:28.480]  taking out deadwood and that's truly what has happened now
[03:44:28.480 --> 03:44:31.280]  then they came for the ranchers you got all these people in the city say i hate
[03:44:31.280 --> 03:44:34.560]  people who are rednecks who live out in the forest they don't understand what's
[03:44:34.560 --> 03:44:37.280]  going on with this now they are coming for the
[03:44:37.280 --> 03:44:40.480]  sheriffs do you understand what's happening now
[03:44:40.480 --> 03:44:43.280]  they're coming for the sheriffs they're coming for the journalists they're
[03:44:43.280 --> 03:44:47.280]  coming for the protesters that's where we are with this tyranny
[03:44:47.280 --> 03:44:50.640]  they're going to be coming for you and your little comfortable suburban home
[03:44:50.640 --> 03:44:53.040]  they're going to round you up and if they don't put you in a FEMA camp
[03:44:53.040 --> 03:44:56.400]  they're going to put you in a city with their agenda 21
[03:44:56.400 --> 03:45:00.240]  Rob what are your comments about this i just can't believe it
[03:45:00.240 --> 03:45:04.640]  as usual that it totally defies logic but this is
[03:45:04.640 --> 03:45:07.600]  you see this anytime the federal government thinks they're above the law
[03:45:07.600 --> 03:45:10.640]  oh they are and you're really when you get brought up on charges you're almost
[03:45:10.640 --> 03:45:14.480]  better off either taking a deal or letting them win
[03:45:14.480 --> 03:45:17.840]  the first time because they will keep bringing charges against you i've heard
[03:45:17.840 --> 03:45:22.080]  story after story from people i had one this company used to make
[03:45:22.080 --> 03:45:24.880]  jinch and violet and they used to put it in chicken feed
[03:45:24.880 --> 03:45:29.120]  because it would keep the chickens from getting salmonella and worms wow
[03:45:29.120 --> 03:45:32.800]  okay you didn't hear about salmonella and war and in the 70s
[03:45:32.800 --> 03:45:36.160]  the 80s they the feds went against these guys and they beat them
[03:45:36.160 --> 03:45:40.240]  the the jinch and violet producers beat them they they went to court six more
[03:45:40.240 --> 03:45:42.960]  times so they finally beat them said well this causes cancer you can't put this
[03:45:42.960 --> 03:45:46.160]  in chicken feed now we got salmonella in in eggs
[03:45:46.160 --> 03:45:50.000]  so you know it's just is it the government doesn't care if it's wrong
[03:45:50.000 --> 03:45:53.920]  it only cares if it wins that's right it does not care at all we got the FDA we
[03:45:53.920 --> 03:45:56.480]  got the DEA we got all these tyrannies we got the EPA
[03:45:56.480 --> 03:46:00.240]  yeah putting fines on people thinking that they own holding property even
[03:46:00.240 --> 03:46:03.760]  yeah they're the ones who are making the massive pollution blowing up that gold
[03:46:03.760 --> 03:46:05.280]  mine everybody told them it was going to happen
[03:46:05.280 --> 03:46:08.480]  and even the retired mining engineer said they're doing this so they can create
[03:46:08.480 --> 03:46:11.600]  a super fund for themselves right expand their fiefdom
[03:46:11.600 --> 03:46:15.120]  i think the real remedy for this for the moment what we can do as citizens
[03:46:15.120 --> 03:46:18.320]  we have to educate each other on jury nullification the bundies are going to
[03:46:18.320 --> 03:46:21.040]  be coming up for trial yeah it made me sick to see this county
[03:46:21.040 --> 03:46:24.240]  commissioner convicted in this court it made me sick to see the Hammond's
[03:46:24.240 --> 03:46:27.920]  convicted in court people need to be to stop being sheep
[03:46:27.920 --> 03:46:32.480]  you need to understand that when you're a juror you need to look at this and say
[03:46:32.480 --> 03:46:37.200]  is it warranted for the government to send the bundies to jail for 40 years for
[03:46:37.200 --> 03:46:41.520]  what happened there wasn't the the actions weren't the actions of
[03:46:41.520 --> 03:46:46.000]  Dan Love and the BLM weren't they far worse than anything that happened in
[03:46:46.000 --> 03:46:48.400]  that standoff you have to look at this and say all right
[03:46:48.400 --> 03:46:52.560]  they got scared because weapons were brandish you know when they cleared Dan Love
[03:46:52.560 --> 03:46:56.320]  of a wrongful death they said you know just having firearms and pointing them
[03:46:56.320 --> 03:46:59.200]  at people that that really didn't constitute an assault
[03:46:59.200 --> 03:47:02.240]  but that's what they're saying about the bundies they have a double standard
[03:47:02.240 --> 03:47:06.320]  that is so incredible we have to say look i understand what's going on
[03:47:06.320 --> 03:47:11.680]  and even if this was a conspiracy to stop the government from moving this cattle
[03:47:11.680 --> 03:47:15.360]  i don't agree with the penalties that you were applying with this and i'm not
[03:47:15.360 --> 03:47:19.200]  going to find these people guilty and these charges are lies are charging
[03:47:19.200 --> 03:47:22.560]  Clive and Bundy with having uh with threatening them with firearms he never
[03:47:22.560 --> 03:47:26.400]  carried firearms the days that we were there he wasn't even at the standout
[03:47:26.400 --> 03:47:30.240]  the standoff at the washout it is absolutely incredible
[03:47:30.240 --> 03:47:34.560]  this is a criminal government and and uh i mean we could go on and on about this
[03:47:34.560 --> 03:47:37.200]  but again there's a judge that charged the BLM with criminal
[03:47:37.200 --> 03:47:40.960]  conspiracy you don't hear anything about that in another case uh in nevada
[03:47:40.960 --> 03:47:45.440]  hagi case he charged the BLM with nothing about that in the mainstream press
[03:47:45.440 --> 03:47:49.600]  absolutely nothing they get away with literally with murder they pick and
[03:47:49.600 --> 03:47:52.560]  choose and now it's a it's a trump staffer just about is what they're
[03:47:52.560 --> 03:47:55.760]  calling this guy uh you know got arrested and he's just
[03:47:55.760 --> 03:47:59.360]  involved in his own little group but they're trying to tie it to donald trump
[03:47:59.360 --> 03:48:03.200]  and then you got this meme contest that alex put out yesterday it was a flash
[03:48:03.200 --> 03:48:06.640]  meme contest thousand dollars for the winner we're going to
[03:48:06.640 --> 03:48:09.440]  put out the winner today we're going to we're going to pick it here yeah we want

[03:48:12.640 --> 03:48:15.360]  still on something kind of serious yeah ryan in texas has been holding for a
[03:48:15.360 --> 03:48:17.520]  very long time we're going to talk about health care
[03:48:17.520 --> 03:48:21.440]  let's go to brian i know he's been holding for a long time brian go ahead
[03:48:21.440 --> 03:48:24.800]  hey david rob it's pleasure to be on with you guys today can you hear me okay
[03:48:24.800 --> 03:48:28.880]  here you thank you for calling go ahead very good thing hey i got a question
[03:48:28.880 --> 03:48:32.240]  about health care and let me build this scenario before i
[03:48:32.240 --> 03:48:36.880]  ask you guys okay so let's say uh donald trump is elected president
[03:48:36.880 --> 03:48:41.120]  and let's say uh like in his book he gets uh he takes care of all the
[03:48:41.120 --> 03:48:45.120]  waste abuse and fraud in the government and that saves a lot of money let's say
[03:48:45.120 --> 03:48:48.480]  we get rid of the uh did you see his did you see his health care plan that they
[03:48:48.480 --> 03:48:51.280]  didn't talk about in the debate last night that he published yesterday
[03:48:51.280 --> 03:48:55.760]  at seven point health care plan okay absolutely i did yeah sure
[03:48:55.760 --> 03:49:00.080]  but anyway um so let's say uh we have we save a lot of money he brings the
[03:49:00.080 --> 03:49:03.280]  corporate jobs back over by cutting the corporate tax rate let's just say the
[03:49:03.280 --> 03:49:06.880]  economy is flourishing after he gets elected now
[03:49:06.880 --> 03:49:10.400]  my question it's based around the single payer
[03:49:10.400 --> 03:49:14.640]  a single payer health care system now i'm a major advocate for a free market i
[03:49:14.640 --> 03:49:18.160]  think it works i think it's great but concerning health care uh with that
[03:49:18.160 --> 03:49:23.200]  scenario in place that i described um and could a single health assuming that
[03:49:23.200 --> 03:49:26.640]  we have honest people in government make with that assumption
[03:49:26.640 --> 03:49:31.680]  could a single health care uh plan work could it would it could it be effective
[03:49:31.680 --> 03:49:35.120]  in in any way i don't i don't agree i think that when you eliminate competition
[03:49:35.120 --> 03:49:39.520]  listen when hillary clinton was pushing uh her health care takeover uh back in
[03:49:39.520 --> 03:49:42.560]  the beginning of the clinton administration they kept saying uh we
[03:49:42.560 --> 03:49:46.800]  need a single care a single payer health care because it's going to make uh
[03:49:46.800 --> 03:49:49.760]  things cheaper no competition makes things cheaper if you look at donald
[03:49:49.760 --> 03:49:53.760]  trump's plan what he has here are multiple aspects to give us price
[03:49:53.760 --> 03:49:57.920]  transparency so we can make decisions give us the ability to make
[03:49:57.920 --> 03:50:02.320]  the purchases ourselves to create competition between health insurance
[03:50:02.320 --> 03:50:05.920]  companies to remove this restriction of trade
[03:50:05.920 --> 03:50:09.440]  that is around state lines right now they cannot trade across state lines
[03:50:09.440 --> 03:50:12.080]  what is wrong with that i mean one of the charges against the bundies is that
[03:50:12.080 --> 03:50:15.360]  they inhibited interstate commerce the government is
[03:50:15.360 --> 03:50:18.640]  inhibiting interstate commerce with health care providers i mean it's
[03:50:18.640 --> 03:50:22.960]  absolutely crazy they would allow uh this kind of transparency letting people
[03:50:22.960 --> 03:50:25.200]  know what the costs are in hospitals and
[03:50:25.200 --> 03:50:28.480]  clinics there's nothing in this plan at all there's seven points
[03:50:28.480 --> 03:50:33.200]  uh and uh there's nothing in here at all about having a single payer plan
[03:50:33.200 --> 03:50:36.640]  anything run by the government is designed to fail
[03:50:36.640 --> 03:50:41.680]  cost way too much and be inefficient that is the the hallmark of a government
[03:50:41.680 --> 03:50:44.080]  plan yes so you're never going to have in whatever
[03:50:44.080 --> 03:50:46.880]  that it doesn't matter what it is it could be building a bridge
[03:50:46.880 --> 03:50:50.960]  it's not going to work it's going to be cost too much and it'll break in a few
[03:50:50.960 --> 03:50:54.320]  years yeah that's just what they do it's you know that
[03:50:54.320 --> 03:50:56.880]  there's many problems there's many reasons why that is hang on we're going
[03:50:56.880 --> 03:50:59.840]  to be right back and we're going to go to this meme contest and judge the winners
