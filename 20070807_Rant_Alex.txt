[00:00:00.572 --> 00:00:01.913]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:01.913 --> 00:00:02.353]  Welcome.
[00:00:02.353 --> 00:00:03.834]  It is the sixth day of August 2007.
[00:00:03.834 --> 00:00:07.536]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:07.536 --> 00:00:13.079]  We don't have any guests today because I want to be able to cover news and take your phone calls.
[00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.641]  The stock market is in serious decline right now.
[00:00:15.641 --> 00:00:26.047]  The dollar is in free fall again today, as well as the nation's second-largest mortgage lender declaring bankruptcy unexpectedly.
[00:00:26.047 --> 00:00:29.669]  And that's not because of people who are at risk.
[00:00:30.633 --> 00:00:35.096]  Uh, borrowers defaulting or slow paying.
[00:00:35.096 --> 00:00:41.820]  That is because of quote, main line people with good credit.
[00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.861]  Very serious.
[00:00:42.861 --> 00:00:45.242]  So the latest info is coming out on that minute by minute.
[00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:48.024]  We'll be covering that when we get back from break.
[00:00:48.024 --> 00:00:53.287]  Also, as if that isn't bad enough, we now have new details since I first covered this yesterday on the Sunday show we do now.
[00:00:54.668 --> 00:00:59.130]  Foot-and-mouth virus released from government laboratory in England.
[00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:06.094]  They did this last time and killed 8 million sheep, more than 2 million cows, and devastated most farms in the nation.
[00:01:06.094 --> 00:01:12.538]  This is all about control and quarantines and lockdowns, and they're even admitting the government did it again.
[00:01:12.538 --> 00:01:15.219]  I mean, and they just admit it and then roll forward.
[00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:22.756]  And folks, I see articles like this every day, but I usually don't see three or four or five in one day.
[00:01:22.756 --> 00:01:27.620]  There are five stories today.
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:35.546]  Headline, the Denver News Channel 7, ABC, fire crew bosses who can't speak Spanish are fired.
[00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:37.668]  Can't lose jobs.
[00:01:37.668 --> 00:01:38.789]  Another headline here.
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.243]  English speaker says the landlord's message is clear.
[00:01:45.243 --> 00:01:47.104]  No Spanish, you're kicked out.
[00:01:47.104 --> 00:01:50.147]  We don't want gringos here anymore.
[00:01:50.147 --> 00:01:52.609]  Here's another one, and this story is amazing.
[00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:55.091]  It's out of the Washington Times, but they spin it.
[00:01:55.091 --> 00:01:57.673]  The headline should be racial attack.
[00:01:57.673 --> 00:02:04.138]  Legal aliens fire into the facility, it's believed, and it turns into clerk blames firing on illegalist debate.
[00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.030]  He was wearing a U.S.
[00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.811]  Border Patrol baseball cap.
[00:02:07.811 --> 00:02:12.532]  They walked in, yelled at him, walked out, fired into the structure, and his boss said, hey, you shouldn't be wearing that.
[00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.233]  You're fired.
[00:02:14.233 --> 00:02:16.193]  And I have several more, folks.
[00:02:16.193 --> 00:02:19.954]  It's very, very serious.
[00:02:19.954 --> 00:02:22.695]  Also, they're finally getting you ready for the mass sanitariums.
[00:02:24.833 --> 00:02:37.340]  That has a popular connotation of mental institutions, but no, sanitarium generally, at least in this country, was mass facilities for those with TB where you could quietly die or convalesce.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.381]  In Texas, TB lock-up!
[00:02:40.381 --> 00:02:44.163]  Rate of TB explodes exponentially!
[00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:50.486]  And you may love the illegal aliens, but when you're coughing your bloody lungs up, you're gonna remember.
[00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:51.307]  You're gonna remember.
[00:02:52.441 --> 00:03:00.065]  So, we'll be going over that as it exponentially, geometrically explodes.
[00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:17.993]  And now the media gets to spin it and get you to, easy, easy, easy, just let us load you, you old Mustang, onto the trailer, you're going to a nice place, and as soon as they throw that bolt, they just laugh and say, you're going to a nice Elmer's Glue factory!
[00:03:17.993 --> 00:03:19.774]  That's Roger Ailes and
[00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:23.410]  Rush Limbaugh and all of them.
[00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.551]  That's what Rupert Murdoch's all about.
[00:03:25.551 --> 00:03:30.153]  Just here to neutralize you long enough with phony conservative diatribe.
[00:03:30.153 --> 00:03:40.277]  Just long enough to throw that bolt.
[00:03:40.277 --> 00:03:43.518]  That's literally their spirit, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:43.518 --> 00:03:47.260]  American homophiles for bankruptcy after shutdown.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.502]  No discussion of bailouts in the last few months as they knew this was coming.
[00:03:52.502 --> 00:03:57.824]  I said unexpected for us, but they knew it was expected.
[00:03:57.824 --> 00:04:00.605]  Oh yeah, we live in very interesting times right now.
[00:04:01.587 --> 00:04:06.609]  We're going to have all the latest financial news as it develops posted on JonesReport.com.
[00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:16.513]  Aaron Dice is in there feverishly posting stories, the latest index news that is from all over the place, grabbed from everywhere, and we've got a big report on this coming out later this evening.
[00:04:16.513 --> 00:04:18.074]  JonesReport.com, stay with us.
[00:04:24.833 --> 00:04:30.656]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:04:30.656 --> 00:04:38.299]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:04:39.002 --> 00:04:46.444]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:04:46.444 --> 00:04:58.187]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:04:58.187 --> 00:05:02.148]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:05:02.148 --> 00:05:04.409]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:08.250]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.
[00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:16.181]  Get your copy today on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139 or watch it right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:05:22.609 --> 00:05:31.933]  Now, you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:43.498]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw, stagnant pond water, into delicious, crystal-clear drinking water.
[00:05:43.498 --> 00:05:49.201]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:05:49.541 --> 00:05:49.921]  I think?
[00:06:07.193 --> 00:06:09.236]  Elements get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[00:06:09.236 --> 00:06:10.097]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:10.097 --> 00:06:11.880]  That's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:06:21.593 --> 00:06:23.555]  Hello, this is Amy Bjorklund.
[00:06:23.555 --> 00:06:31.103]  Thanks to a quantum leap in garlic research, the health benefits of 20 fresh garlic cloves are now available in one tiny capsule.
[00:06:31.103 --> 00:06:39.092]  With stabilized allicin, the proven power of garlic has been transformed into what is perhaps the most important medicinal product ever developed.
[00:06:39.092 --> 00:06:40.173]  And there's no odor.
[00:06:40.393 --> 00:06:50.478]  Stabilized Allicin gives you and your family a safe, natural weapon that kills harmful bacteria, viruses, and funguses, all without harming the friendly bacteria in the digestive tract.
[00:06:50.478 --> 00:06:58.982]  This means strong immunity, fewer and shorter colds, and the best possible protection from deadly diseases, none of which prescription drugs can offer.
[00:06:58.982 --> 00:07:04.545]  What's more, this product can deter mosquitoes from biting you and safely keep fleas and ticks off your pets.
[00:07:04.665 --> 00:07:11.768]  For more information, visit Garlic, the number 4, yourheart.com, or click on the banner at GCNlive.com.
[00:07:11.768 --> 00:07:15.830]  Or, call Amy personally at 805-595-2711.
[00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.511]  That's 805-595-2711.
[00:07:18.511 --> 00:07:29.316]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:29.316 --> 00:07:32.297]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:07:49.771 --> 00:07:50.752]  All right, welcome back.
[00:07:50.752 --> 00:08:02.280]  I'm so busy running around during the breaks, grabbing handfuls of news that I barely slid back into the catbird seat here in the cockpit, here in the crow's nest on time to get on air.
[00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:19.117]  Right now the Dow going down to 1320 went back up a paltry 70% or 75 points to 1325 right now.
[00:08:19.117 --> 00:08:31.043]  As the Federal Reserve and others at least make a cursory appearance of trying to bolster the market.
[00:08:31.043 --> 00:08:35.025]  I forgot to ask you, John, did you get that Jim Cramer freaking out this morning clip?
[00:08:36.283 --> 00:08:37.765]  Let's go ahead and play a few minutes of that.
[00:08:37.765 --> 00:08:38.045]  Here it is.
[00:08:54.721 --> 00:08:59.187]  And told everyone to take a teaser rate and then raised the rate 17 times?
[00:08:59.187 --> 00:09:01.469]  And Bernanke is being an academic!
[00:09:01.469 --> 00:09:03.692]  It is no time to be an academic!
[00:09:03.692 --> 00:09:06.055]  It is time to get on the Bear Stearns call!
[00:09:06.055 --> 00:09:06.816]  Listen!
[00:09:06.816 --> 00:09:08.638]  Open the darn Fed window!
[00:09:08.638 --> 00:09:10.841]  He has no idea how bad it is out there!
[00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:12.443]  He has no idea!
[00:09:12.443 --> 00:09:13.705]  He has no idea!
[00:09:14.622 --> 00:09:15.142]  Kramer.
[00:09:15.142 --> 00:09:21.728]  I have talked to the heads of almost every single one of these firms in the last 72 hours, and he has no idea what it's like out there!
[00:09:21.728 --> 00:09:22.609]  None!
[00:09:22.609 --> 00:09:26.352]  And Bill Poole has no idea what it's like out there!
[00:09:26.352 --> 00:09:33.858]  My people have been in this game for 25 years, and they are losing their jobs, and these firms are gonna go out of business, and he's nuts!
[00:09:33.858 --> 00:09:34.819]  They're nuts!
[00:09:34.819 --> 00:09:36.741]  They know nothing!
[00:09:36.741 --> 00:09:37.041]  Kramer.
[00:09:38.767 --> 00:09:45.038]  I have not seen it like this since I went by bid for a half a million shares of Citigroup and I got hit in 1990!
[00:09:45.038 --> 00:09:46.841]  This is a different kind of market!
[00:09:46.841 --> 00:09:48.264]  And the Fed is asleep!
[00:09:49.048 --> 00:09:49.909]  Okay, but here's the thing.
[00:09:49.909 --> 00:09:51.730]  No, Bill Poole is a shame!
[00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.171]  He's shameful!
[00:09:53.171 --> 00:09:54.453]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[00:09:54.453 --> 00:09:56.754]  He ought to go and read the accredited home document.
[00:09:56.754 --> 00:09:58.096]  At least I read the darn thing.
[00:09:58.096 --> 00:10:06.282]  Hold on, I know you're passionate and I hear you, but at the same time, a lot of people are saying this is, yes, there's certain types of mortgages that aren't available.
[00:10:06.282 --> 00:10:09.525]  You can't get it on loan to get rich like me.
[00:10:10.686 --> 00:10:14.451]  Well, Kramer, if you did what you said, which seems to me from the way you just explained yourself... Open the door!
[00:10:14.451 --> 00:10:15.152]  Just kill me now!
[00:10:15.152 --> 00:10:15.293]  Cut it!
[00:10:15.293 --> 00:10:16.014]  Cut the rake!
[00:10:16.014 --> 00:10:16.314]  Open the door!
[00:10:16.314 --> 00:10:16.715]  Just kill me now!
[00:10:16.715 --> 00:10:16.995]  Cut the rake!
[00:10:16.995 --> 00:10:17.596]  We'll leave the pressure!
[00:10:17.596 --> 00:10:19.639]  If you come back next week and cut rake... We'll leave the pressure!
[00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:20.300]  You're gonna have...
[00:10:21.081 --> 00:10:22.382]  That's going to cause Armageddon.
[00:10:22.382 --> 00:10:23.483]  No, we have Armageddon.
[00:10:23.483 --> 00:10:25.706]  I wouldn't try to cause it, except we have Armageddon.
[00:10:25.706 --> 00:10:27.307]  In the fixed income markets, we have Armageddon.
[00:10:27.307 --> 00:10:28.288]  No, but that's not what they say.
[00:10:28.288 --> 00:10:28.849]  We have Armageddon.
[00:10:28.849 --> 00:10:32.392]  They say, even when I've talked to a couple banks, they don't say it's Armageddon.
[00:10:32.392 --> 00:10:33.934]  They say it's repricing.
[00:10:33.934 --> 00:10:35.355]  They're very firm about that even now.
[00:10:35.355 --> 00:10:35.696]  Oh, great.
[00:10:35.696 --> 00:10:41.882]  Okay, well let them be calm and then have them call me on the way home like they do every night and tell me, Kramer, what are you going to do about it?
[00:10:41.882 --> 00:10:42.763]  Are you going to help us?
[00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:44.190]  Are you going to help us?
[00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.912]  Are you going to stand on the sideline, like everybody else, and say that it's fine?
[00:10:47.912 --> 00:10:51.433]  Will somebody come on TV and tell the truth about how bad it is?
[00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:55.655]  But a lot of people say, these same people say, it's not Ben Bernanke and the rate that matters.
[00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:57.896]  The bond market now is completely separate from the rate.
[00:10:57.896 --> 00:10:58.496]  No, it is the rate.
[00:10:58.496 --> 00:10:59.397]  It's entirely the rate.
[00:10:59.397 --> 00:11:00.537]  No, it's entirely the rate.
[00:11:00.537 --> 00:11:02.318]  Look, we'll spend billions in Iraq to
[00:11:02.398 --> 00:11:03.179]  Bill Holmes.
[00:11:03.179 --> 00:11:04.580]  We are going to have thousands of people.
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.282]  We have thousands of people losing their homes right now.
[00:11:07.282 --> 00:11:10.825]  14 million people took a mortgage in the last three years.
[00:11:10.825 --> 00:11:14.027]  7 million of them took teaser rates or took piggyback rates.
[00:11:14.027 --> 00:11:15.228]  They will lose their homes.
[00:11:15.228 --> 00:11:17.190]  This is crazy!
[00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:30.681]  I'm sorry to be upset about it, but you have to understand what they're saying to me, off the record, before I come in here, every night and every day, and what I hear from these blowhard managers, who act like, call someone for heaven's sake!
[00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:32.102]  Go call someone!
[00:11:32.102 --> 00:11:34.444]  I worked at fixed income at Goldman Sachs!
[00:11:34.444 --> 00:11:38.747]  This is not the time to be complacent!
[00:11:38.747 --> 00:11:39.468]  Alright?
[00:11:39.468 --> 00:11:43.671]  I mean, Soren, sometimes I wish I didn't know anybody, so I could just sit here and say, you know what?
[00:11:43.671 --> 00:11:45.033]  Just go buy some Washington.
[00:11:45.033 --> 00:11:59.985]  You know, I used to think Kramer, I used to think it was an act, but then I've seen him in interviews admit that he's a criminal, and admit that they engage in crimes when they're short-selling, when they're trying to knock down a stock so that they get their put, and so it does lose.
[00:12:01.724 --> 00:12:06.107]  And there he is admitting what's going on, only in one little fashion, one area.
[00:12:06.107 --> 00:12:08.248]  Here's the deal.
[00:12:08.248 --> 00:12:16.733]  The Financial Times of London, the real paper of record, it's never been the Wall Street Journal, it certainly isn't now that Rupert Murdoch owns it.
[00:12:16.733 --> 00:12:29.081]  The Financial Times of London and the Times of London really are both papers of record, but I meant to say the Financial Times of London financially is where you'll get more of the truth than anywhere else, because the elite has to have a way to talk to all its minions.
[00:12:29.953 --> 00:12:32.754]  And you don't even have to read between the lines there.
[00:12:32.754 --> 00:12:37.596]  They will tell you what's going on with just a few little thin veils, basically.
[00:12:37.596 --> 00:12:39.317]  But it's always buried right there.
[00:12:39.317 --> 00:12:46.700]  And they said over a year ago, they said, we're going to slowly bring down America, and they're going to incrementally drop the dollar, incrementally raise oil.
[00:12:47.668 --> 00:13:12.593]  They're going to incrementally repossess homes, and the great danger to even the elite and their managers is that they have pumped the bubble up so big that if they don't do it very slowly, that is, boil the frog very slowly, that it could cause a true world meltdown and could actually even destroy some of the portfolios of the elite and turn into a complete badlum.
[00:13:12.593 --> 00:13:17.214]  And so the reason, Mr. Kramer, that they're not going among many, but the main
[00:13:18.228 --> 00:13:41.097]  Paramount reason, the prime evil mover, driver, engine in all of this, of all the reasons, the reason that takes pole position, a lot of verbal flourishes there, is that if they lower interest rates, the dollar will slide by probably 15 to 20 cents in a week alone.
[00:13:42.665 --> 00:13:53.150]  And they want the dollar to slide, make no mistake, but they want it to continue a slow, agonized, quiet death that yuppies can't notice.
[00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:55.071]  Okay, so they've needed to increase rates.
[00:13:55.071 --> 00:14:02.675]  In fact, if they wanted to save the dollar, rates would be at 10-15 percent right now, because that wouldn't even keep up with inflation.
[00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:09.218]  They expect, on the international bond market, for foreign countries to buy government securities when the
[00:14:12.026 --> 00:14:24.611]  Government securities they're buying that mature in 10, 20, 30 years aren't even keeping value, aren't even gaining 1% a year, but are in negative slide.
[00:14:24.611 --> 00:14:31.734]  So, to have a rate of 10% is not enough.
[00:14:31.734 --> 00:14:33.535]  By the way, I don't want high interest rates.
[00:14:33.535 --> 00:14:35.676]  I'm just talking about reality here.
[00:14:36.371 --> 00:14:39.492]  They can add a bunch of mumbo-jumbo to it all day long.
[00:14:39.492 --> 00:14:41.212]  This is real simple, folks.
[00:14:41.212 --> 00:14:44.593]  We are completely screwed.
[00:14:44.593 --> 00:14:50.835]  I mean, there's not really other ways to describe this.
[00:14:50.835 --> 00:14:55.276]  And of course, Kramer, they're letting all this happen.
[00:14:55.276 --> 00:14:57.817]  They want to bankrupt these people.
[00:14:57.817 --> 00:15:00.177]  They want to take these houses.
[00:15:00.177 --> 00:15:05.619]  The brokers and the pit bosses and all the little minions don't.
[00:15:06.269 --> 00:15:11.252]  But the people up above do want a consolidation.
[00:15:11.252 --> 00:15:21.458]  That's why, when you're living in your dormitory, eating ramen noodle, and flipping burgers to put yourself through college, you get a credit card every two days in the mail.
[00:15:21.458 --> 00:15:31.984]  When you get out of debt, and you've got a little bit of money in the bank, and you've got a good credit score, they don't come but maybe twice a year.
[00:15:31.984 --> 00:15:33.424]  I've had them cancel.
[00:15:33.424 --> 00:15:33.945]  I had a...
[00:15:35.763 --> 00:15:58.256]  Capital One card that I've had and I only had it for emergencies to get gas if I didn't have cash or if I ever had a problem I think I had like five hundred dollars I could have spent on it and I never used it I mean maybe two or three times a year and they just cancelled and I called them and said why is this cancelled and they said you're not the type of customer we want you're not using the card because they thought I was one of these
[00:15:59.269 --> 00:16:04.911]  You know, 19-year-olds that wanted to run around and wear some baubles to, you know, signants of power.
[00:16:04.911 --> 00:16:06.971]  I'm not a monkey.
[00:16:06.971 --> 00:16:07.351]  Alright?
[00:16:07.351 --> 00:16:09.032]  Just get that through your head.
[00:16:09.032 --> 00:16:11.973]  I'm not part of the monkey class, and you need to understand that.
[00:16:11.973 --> 00:16:20.836]  And all of us need to stop being part of the monkey class that walk around flashing signants and logos at people while the elite are above us.
[00:16:20.836 --> 00:16:25.397]  We're all at a costume party, running around, posing, acting stylish like a bunch of monkeys.
[00:16:26.241 --> 00:16:30.142]  And the elite are literally completely engineering a hell pit for you.
[00:16:30.142 --> 00:16:36.803]  I mean, I don't know really how else to say it.
[00:16:36.803 --> 00:16:43.245]  I'm going to go over some more of the financial news, and then later, as things develop in the show, I'm going to get into it in more detail.
[00:16:43.245 --> 00:16:48.326]  We're going to get into how the British government has launched a foot-and-mouth bioweapon attack.
[00:16:48.326 --> 00:16:49.666]  That's, by the way, hidden in plain view.
[00:16:49.666 --> 00:16:52.747]  I mean, they're entering a new level of propaganda, where they even admit it now.
[00:16:53.655 --> 00:16:55.658]  Of course, they were running a drill and it was released.
[00:16:55.658 --> 00:16:58.301]  I mean, does it ever end?
[00:16:58.301 --> 00:17:00.584]  No, it doesn't.
[00:17:00.584 --> 00:17:06.591]  We're also going to get into the illegal aliens are shooting at people, telling folks, get out of your house.
[00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:09.355]  You're not no English allowed.
[00:17:09.355 --> 00:17:11.037]  And in more and more towns, it's spreading.
[00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.612]  The police are openly announcing illegals are above the law and not to be stopped.
[00:17:16.612 --> 00:17:23.236]  Now it's in newspapers every day that, yeah, our officers have been told, don't stop them from drinking, it doesn't matter, just leave them alone.
[00:17:23.236 --> 00:17:30.520]  I mean, you have a rich, wealthy country with a bunch of spoiled brats living in it, and you're going to get taken real fast.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.121]  It's real simple.
[00:17:32.121 --> 00:17:38.044]  And folks, we're being took by third world surges, by elite bank zoning everything.
[00:17:38.044 --> 00:17:40.366]  I mean, just the raping is going to be good.
[00:17:41.425 --> 00:17:45.167]  I mean, it's going to be severe.
[00:17:45.167 --> 00:17:48.790]  It's going to be mooey big.
[00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:57.555]  And if we recognize who the enemy is now, they may put the brakes on and just beat the living daylights out of us, up one side and down the other.
[00:17:57.555 --> 00:18:04.800]  But I'm telling you right now, if you don't put out the maximum effort to expose the New World Order, they're going to go into full martial law.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.361]  It is going to be hell on earth.
[00:18:06.361 --> 00:18:10.804]  And I just hope everybody out there who didn't do anything and who sat there on the bench with their thumb in their mouth,
[00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:16.192]  I hope that you realize that you could have averted this.
[00:18:16.192 --> 00:18:20.635]  Because they won't pull the trigger on our society completely.
[00:18:20.635 --> 00:18:25.239]  Unless they have tested the water and unless they've decided you're going to go along with it.
[00:18:25.239 --> 00:18:28.741]  And from what I'm seeing, they've decided you're going to take it.
[00:18:28.741 --> 00:18:32.724]  The level of tyranny that you're going to live under is the exact amount you put up with.
[00:18:34.984 --> 00:18:35.724]  Okay?
[00:18:35.724 --> 00:18:38.525]  You ever had pushy bosses or pushy employees?
[00:18:38.525 --> 00:18:41.066]  You ever had pushy neighbors or pushy family?
[00:18:41.066 --> 00:18:45.068]  And it's like magic, when you finally stood up to them, they finally left you alone?
[00:18:45.068 --> 00:18:55.312]  You thought going along made it okay, and then one day you finally stood up, and you found out it was the opposite.
[00:18:55.312 --> 00:19:00.594]  Now, what I'm really going to cover, coming up in about 15 minutes, is a timeline.
[00:19:00.594 --> 00:19:01.654]  A police state.
[00:19:01.654 --> 00:19:03.475]  A tyranny timeline.
[00:19:04.605 --> 00:19:09.609]  The timeline of tyranny.
[00:19:09.609 --> 00:19:13.052]  Just so you can look at where we've gone the last six, seven years.
[00:19:13.052 --> 00:19:14.633]  And where we're going.
[00:19:14.633 --> 00:19:14.933]  Alright?
[00:19:14.933 --> 00:19:17.275]  To know where you're going, you gotta know where you come from.
[00:19:17.275 --> 00:19:18.176]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:22.014 --> 00:19:27.397]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:19:27.397 --> 00:19:35.741]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:19:35.741 --> 00:19:42.784]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:19:42.964 --> 00:19:44.325]  Radioactive poisoning.
[00:19:44.325 --> 00:19:50.408]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:19:50.408 --> 00:19:55.611]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:19:55.611 --> 00:20:04.757]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:20:04.757 --> 00:20:09.619]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:25.663]  Do you know the truth about cancer treatments?
[00:21:25.663 --> 00:21:34.571]  Do you realize that with all presently accepted methods, you are not correctly attacking the cancer, and you are mostly fighting to survive the treatment?
[00:21:34.571 --> 00:21:42.238]  Do you realize that mutilating surgery, burning, and the poisoning of your entire system are totally unnecessary?
[00:21:42.947 --> 00:21:48.929]  But now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaceMedInc's patented methodology.

[00:22:18.923 --> 00:22:27.050]  The disciples asked Jesus in Matthew 24, What shall be the signs of thy coming, and the end of the world?
[00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:29.132]  You shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars.
[00:22:29.132 --> 00:22:32.355]  For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
[00:22:32.355 --> 00:22:35.797]  And there shall be famines, disease, and earthquakes in many places.
[00:22:35.797 --> 00:22:37.659]  We are living in this time of earth's history.
[00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:41.882]  Many people are trying to understand the climactic world events in light of human wisdom.
[00:22:41.882 --> 00:22:44.564]  But without the wisdom of God, this is impossible.
[00:22:44.564 --> 00:22:49.669]  2 Peter says, We have a more sure word of prophecy, and you do well if you take heed.
[00:22:49.669 --> 00:22:54.352]  But first know this, that no prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation.
[00:22:54.352 --> 00:22:59.016]  The Bible says, would like you to receive this new offer, Packet B, The Unholy Alliance.
[00:22:59.016 --> 00:23:03.600]  These materials document the global leaders, political and religious, behind the scenes.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.242]  You will receive information regarding America and prophecy.
[00:23:06.482 --> 00:23:10.423]  You see, in 1913, the private families of the Bank of England, allied with several robber baron families in the U.S.,
[00:23:38.527 --> 00:23:42.788]  ...took control of the treasury and the issuance of money.
[00:23:42.788 --> 00:23:48.329]  And everything they've done is in cycles to further consolidate power, further consolidate their wealth.
[00:23:48.329 --> 00:23:50.810]  It was a big country, most wealthy in the world.
[00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:57.011]  4% of the world's population already had roughly half the world's wealth, because we had some liberty, compared to other nations.
[00:23:57.011 --> 00:24:00.372]  Not saying we were perfect, but compared to others, we had incredible liberty.
[00:24:01.460 --> 00:24:15.163]  As the founder said, something that hadn't happened in 6,000 years had finally happened and it was precious and needed to be defended, protected the jewel of liberty, the engine of everything else good and wholesome.
[00:24:15.163 --> 00:24:16.943]  So it's all about consolidation.
[00:24:16.943 --> 00:24:27.926]  Everything the really big players do is about getting you extended out as far as they can, getting you as dependent, getting you as in debt as far as they can,
[00:24:28.843 --> 00:24:37.285]  And then violently bringing down the market, in the past has been the model, and then consolidating.
[00:24:37.285 --> 00:24:45.026]  And they have another model they've done where they like to blow out certain sectors of the economy and then consolidate.
[00:24:45.026 --> 00:24:47.647]  And they've been doing that globally.
[00:24:47.647 --> 00:24:54.268]  And they can also do it in different, not just in different sub-sectors of an individual economy, like the United States or Canada or England or Australia,
[00:24:55.189 --> 00:25:07.578]  But then they can also blow out certain sectors in whole regions in Asia, or they can blow out entire sectors, entire economies, and then they come in and consolidate everything.
[00:25:07.578 --> 00:25:11.921]  And for the Euro to truly rise, the dollar has to die.
[00:25:11.921 --> 00:25:17.025]  And for the Euro to then rise out of those ashes, the dollar has to die.
[00:25:18.832 --> 00:25:33.657]  And this is what David Rockefeller said in 1973 when they first released some of the trilateralist documents that they had just written up with that group they found out was Zbigniew Brzezinski, David Rockefeller, and of course Jimmy Carter, who would soon become president.
[00:25:36.613 --> 00:25:49.037]  They said that they would create a euro, they would engineer destabilization of the dollar, then they would lower it, create a regional currency, and then the two would fight with each other, and they'd say, oh, let's stop having booms and busts, let's just merge the two.
[00:25:49.037 --> 00:25:52.518]  See, they always create the crisis and offer the solution.
[00:25:52.518 --> 00:26:03.901]  In fact, when that bridge collapsed late last week, people started calling into the show, emails, hey watch, they'll call for a North American Union, and they'll call for privatizing the roads to pay for all this.
[00:26:03.901 --> 00:26:05.582]  And around the office we said that.
[00:26:06.687 --> 00:26:22.411]  And sure enough, last night I had TV on, monitoring the situation, and I was watching a show on MSNBC, and they had experts on, knowing, oh yes, we need to monetize these and hand the roads over to private interest, and they'll fix things.
[00:26:22.411 --> 00:26:31.554]  And then they cut to somebody else who was agreeing with it, and then I was listening to Derry Brownfield this morning, was reading a news article about it, and he said he saw Rangel on TV pushing it.
[00:26:31.554 --> 00:26:34.495]  So they just must be everywhere saying this.
[00:26:34.495 --> 00:26:35.275]  And sure enough,
[00:26:37.868 --> 00:26:42.931]  Now, by the time the roads are collapsing again after they've handed them over to private interests, people will forget about that.
[00:26:42.931 --> 00:26:45.373]  And the answer will be, privatize more of them!
[00:26:45.373 --> 00:26:56.159]  Which, if you look at these deals, all it is is the foreign companies come in, buy off the politicians for pennies on the dollar, and then literally are just handed the roads, and then taxpayers still build, maintain the roads.
[00:26:56.159 --> 00:26:57.640]  That's the way it is here in Texas.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.861]  They just get all the money!
[00:27:01.113 --> 00:27:06.977]  I mean, you're talking about profits, so we're talking about 160 plus bucks to drive from Austin to Dallas and back.
[00:27:06.977 --> 00:27:09.219]  I mean, that's the state of Texas announcing that.
[00:27:09.219 --> 00:27:12.481]  Transponders tracking everything you do.
[00:27:12.481 --> 00:27:18.685]  But you hear the general public going, yeah, I don't like it, but the roads are collapsing.
[00:27:18.685 --> 00:27:19.926]  70,000 plus roads.
[00:27:19.926 --> 00:27:22.948]  My dad has a friend who was a big construction company head.
[00:27:24.736 --> 00:27:27.477]  Build reactors, nuclear reactors, build them all over the world.
[00:27:27.477 --> 00:27:28.317]  I'm not going to get into it.
[00:27:28.317 --> 00:27:30.378]  I'm not going to give too much info so you can figure out who it is.
[00:27:30.378 --> 00:27:35.160]  It's just one of my dad's friends, who he knows.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.000]  They were out to eat or something last week.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.381]  His old retiree lives here in Austin.
[00:27:39.225 --> 00:27:41.487]  And, uh, my dad's always liked hanging out with old folks.
[00:27:41.487 --> 00:27:43.489]  Now he's old, so I guess it's even better for him.
[00:27:43.489 --> 00:27:44.470]  He could probably listen right now.
[00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:53.158]  The point is, uh, I remember when he was like 30-something, he'd be hanging out with old men to pick their brains, but when I was growing up, I was like, why are we going to this old man's house, you know, in Dallas or whatever?
[00:27:53.158 --> 00:27:57.882]  But the point is, is that, uh, he said, how many of these bridges are like this?
[00:27:57.882 --> 00:28:01.385]  And he said, you don't even want to know, and I'm not going to tell you.
[00:28:01.385 --> 00:28:02.246]  But it's bad.
[00:28:02.246 --> 00:28:03.227]  I mean, they know!
[00:28:03.227 --> 00:28:04.288]  It's about money!
[00:28:05.131 --> 00:28:06.492]  They build them.
[00:28:06.492 --> 00:28:16.459]  That's why when that 18-wheeler crashed in and exploded and burned for hours in white-hot flame and some of the asphalt buckled and fell in, that's because the things fall down on their own.
[00:28:16.459 --> 00:28:20.801]  The comparison of that with the towers is nothing.
[00:28:20.801 --> 00:28:22.643]  But I digress.
[00:28:22.643 --> 00:28:24.764]  The point here is it's the same thing with the economy.
[00:28:24.764 --> 00:28:29.727]  They build junk roads and then go, oh look, I mean you can guess what they're going to do next.
[00:28:29.727 --> 00:28:32.089]  Let's hand them all over in an even bigger scam
[00:28:33.228 --> 00:28:37.691]  To private interest that built the shoddiness to begin with.
[00:28:37.691 --> 00:28:40.632]  I mean, there's roads collapsing all the time.
[00:28:40.632 --> 00:28:43.454]  They're just not huge ones over the Mississippi.
[00:28:43.454 --> 00:28:46.956]  I mean, literally every week some big bridge or trestle collapses.
[00:28:46.956 --> 00:28:49.457]  And it's just kept real quiet.
[00:28:49.457 --> 00:28:56.401]  Usually it's, train overturned, bridge fell down, and then you actually read deeper, the bridge fell, and then the train fell into the river.
[00:28:56.401 --> 00:28:57.562]  But it's kept real quiet.
[00:28:57.562 --> 00:29:00.704]  Oh, train derailment, and you read it was a bridge collapse.
[00:29:02.791 --> 00:29:08.898]  And, uh, some people did report it looked like that bridge was blown, and now I have no doubt they probably did blow it.
[00:29:08.898 --> 00:29:11.901]  They were already working on it.
[00:29:11.901 --> 00:29:13.282]  We're on the march.
[00:29:13.282 --> 00:29:15.805]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:15.805 --> 00:29:18.488]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:21.792 --> 00:29:30.544]  Did you know that we ingest toxins and harsh chemicals every day from the foods and alcohol we consume, the water we drink, and the OTCs and prescription medications we take?
[00:29:30.544 --> 00:29:36.752]  Thankfully, our liver neutralizes the effects of these toxins and eliminates them from our bodies before they can do too much damage.
[00:29:37.032 --> 00:29:44.975]  The fact is the liver performs over 500 vital functions in the body from aiding digestion to removing toxins and maintaining good health.
[00:29:44.975 --> 00:29:55.598]  So why not give your liver the help it needs with Live52, the world's best-selling all-natural liver support formula prescribed by more than 200,000 doctors in over 76 countries.

[00:30:23.482 --> 00:30:29.965]  Each night when you sleep, your body uses the time to restore itself so that you could wake up feeling renewed.
[00:30:29.965 --> 00:30:32.826]  But wouldn't it be nice to also wake up looking younger?

[00:31:24.648 --> 00:31:29.451]  Did you know that the United Nations has never fulfilled its sole goal for existing?
[00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:31.253]  Maintaining world peace?
[00:31:31.253 --> 00:31:32.353]  Do you know why?
[00:31:32.353 --> 00:31:35.275]  Everywhere they've been involved, it becomes worse.

[00:31:54.426 --> 00:32:01.428]  Did you know the rogue nations and terrorist organizations have been purchasing suitcase nuclear bombs on the black market?
[00:32:01.428 --> 00:32:03.369]  Will they use them on America?

[00:32:24.472 --> 00:32:31.101]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:32:31.101 --> 00:32:34.064]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:50.611]  But the reason I got off into the bridge is just the same thing.
[00:32:50.611 --> 00:32:56.693]  The government with private contractors builds the junk, there's a crisis, and then they come out with the solutions.
[00:32:56.693 --> 00:32:58.393]  It's always the same.
[00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:04.615]  After they finally announce the economy's belly up, whether it be a month from now or next year, maybe two years from now.
[00:33:05.568 --> 00:33:12.630]  They'll finally announce it, they'll pre-position, and they'll say, oh, it was the subprime mortgages, or it was the arms.
[00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:16.912]  Normally, when they've done it over in Asia or Europe, it's always a stock trader, some young guy.
[00:33:16.912 --> 00:33:27.215]  You can probably pick who it is, somebody they've built up who's 25 years old, and they thought he was a genius, but he did the $100 million deal, and the average person thinks $100 million's big.
[00:33:27.215 --> 00:33:30.336]  That's not even a penny in David Rockefeller's pocket.
[00:33:30.336 --> 00:33:33.377]  Oh, $100 million deal, with trillions every hour in the
[00:33:33.977 --> 00:33:36.499]  Just in the commodities market, going back and forth.
[00:33:36.499 --> 00:33:37.800]  Oh, he did that deal!
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:38.360]  It's him!
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:38.841]  He did it!
[00:33:38.841 --> 00:33:41.603]  And he'll be arrested, and they'll show him.
[00:33:41.603 --> 00:33:45.005]  You know, it's similar to Martha Stewart with the dot-com bust.
[00:33:45.005 --> 00:33:52.010]  Did nothing wrong, but they'll send her to jail while just incredible crimes are engaged in everywhere.
[00:33:52.010 --> 00:34:01.137]  So, that's why you see the rich buying private islands, the mass looting of the Treasury, the looting of the Pentagon, trillions missing, everybody moving offshore.
[00:34:01.137 --> 00:34:02.578]  I mean, literally,
[00:34:03.550 --> 00:34:07.271]  A year is like a blink of an eye, a twinkle of an eye, not even a blink.
[00:34:07.271 --> 00:34:16.773]  And if you could see, basically in the aggregate, stretch out all the corporations leaving in the blink of an eye, I mean, it is just a... I keep saying this because that's what I envision.
[00:34:16.773 --> 00:34:18.954]  It is a mass evacuation.
[00:34:18.954 --> 00:34:23.835]  I mean, they're running out the front door dropping jewelry, belongings jumping in their helicopters.
[00:34:23.835 --> 00:34:26.316]  They're hanging off the skids of helicopters.
[00:34:26.316 --> 00:34:27.096]  Get me out of here!
[00:34:29.757 --> 00:34:32.697]  Meanwhile, the public's walking around going, I've got the new iPhone.
[00:34:32.697 --> 00:34:34.598]  I've got five more tats.
[00:34:34.598 --> 00:34:39.279]  Oh my gosh, I'm wearing high heels and a miniskirt in the restaurant.
[00:34:39.279 --> 00:34:40.819]  I've got everything down.
[00:34:40.819 --> 00:34:42.200]  I'm rad.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:47.261]  You know, just everyone's so rad and so cool.
[00:34:47.261 --> 00:34:48.721]  Again, I'm not knocking you.
[00:34:48.721 --> 00:34:50.522]  I don't care what you look like.
[00:34:50.522 --> 00:34:51.002]  You understand?
[00:34:51.002 --> 00:34:51.762]  I don't care.
[00:34:52.634 --> 00:35:05.299]  The point is, is that the good old boys are in the cowboy hats fixating, the wannabe businessmen are out playing golf, feeling powerful, and doing their little social club stuff, and trying to show off with their manager.
[00:35:05.299 --> 00:35:06.079]  I mean, you watch it.
[00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:07.480]  You can see people.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:09.000]  They're not conscious.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.882]  They're literally in Wonderland, in dress-up.
[00:35:12.882 --> 00:35:21.945]  And you have to get out of that three-year-old, five-year-old mentality to become an adult and start getting real and realizing even what's going on.
[00:35:23.795 --> 00:35:28.820]  Because if the country was a ship, we are on fire, folks.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.243]  The magazine has just exploded.
[00:35:31.243 --> 00:35:37.749]  We are sinking, and you're on the front deck smoking a cigar, telling me how powerful you are.
[00:35:37.749 --> 00:35:39.111]  And that's the thing, is you'll see
[00:35:40.891 --> 00:36:08.986]  You'll see these men, I've tried to describe this with their girlfriends and they try to project dominance and power and they'll strut in and stick their chest out and wheel around and act tough and rev their car up and man, they're so incredibly cool and they're on top of things and they've got, you know, the coolest clothes and they act the most stylish and they're all leveraged in debt and they have no idea about how the world even works
[00:36:09.787 --> 00:36:12.189]  They have no idea how society even operates.
[00:36:12.189 --> 00:36:12.849]  They're women.
[00:36:12.849 --> 00:36:29.299]  I think they found a good man because he has the trappings of success and the outward dress of someone who's successful.
[00:36:29.299 --> 00:36:32.861]  These guys think it's manly to be for the war.
[00:36:32.861 --> 00:36:35.523]  They think it's tough.
[00:36:35.523 --> 00:36:39.245]  Conversely, hippies think because they go to the coffee shop and drink coffee and
[00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:40.450]  Maybe it's this.
[00:36:40.450 --> 00:36:42.311]  I see the overconfidence.
[00:37:04.412 --> 00:37:05.753]  And it's a false confidence.
[00:37:05.753 --> 00:37:09.334]  It's just an unassured, arrogant attitude.
[00:37:09.334 --> 00:37:16.276]  A smiley-faced, you-know-what-eating-grin type spirit on all these people.
[00:37:16.276 --> 00:37:17.197]  Very proud.
[00:37:17.197 --> 00:37:20.778]  Very haughty.
[00:37:20.778 --> 00:37:23.079]  Lots of false aplomb.
[00:37:23.079 --> 00:37:24.539]  And chutzpah.
[00:37:24.539 --> 00:37:26.040]  Machismo.
[00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:29.181]  Whatever term you want to use.
[00:37:29.181 --> 00:37:30.161]  From whatever language.
[00:37:31.787 --> 00:37:41.331]  And I look at them, and I mean, they should be sweaty-palmed, hair on the back of their neck, standing up, running around trying to get things secured and in place, focused.
[00:37:41.331 --> 00:37:42.971]  And they're not.
[00:37:42.971 --> 00:37:44.432]  They're not, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:44.432 --> 00:37:46.733]  They are children.
[00:37:46.733 --> 00:37:49.554]  Children.
[00:37:49.554 --> 00:37:50.594]  And I've said it many times.
[00:37:50.594 --> 00:38:00.338]  I mean, if your yard, if your dog does something in their yard, they'll come over, knock on your door, and say, you need to have your dog clean that up.
[00:38:00.338 --> 00:38:00.858]  And then they'll
[00:38:01.556 --> 00:38:12.044]  They'll walk back over and you know the type of guy who when they're walking out with a case of beer out of a liquor store or out of the gas station kind of looks left and right and their girlfriend or wife kind of jumps up and down.
[00:38:12.044 --> 00:38:13.585]  Oh, he's tough!
[00:38:13.585 --> 00:38:14.566]  He's tough!
[00:38:14.566 --> 00:38:17.849]  You know like people like that dog guy on TV.
[00:38:17.849 --> 00:38:20.691]  Everybody runs around and acts tough.
[00:38:20.691 --> 00:38:28.597]  I mean it's just they do that and you see the women trittering around as well.
[00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:36.432]  And they have no idea there's a complete scientific dictatorship above them, calculating how to get everything in place to kill you!
[00:38:36.432 --> 00:38:37.913]  To kill you!
[00:38:37.913 --> 00:38:53.618]  First they've got to take everything you've got, get you into more and more welfare, get you more and more into the government state, get you into more and more compact cities, get you tracked and traced, and then they're going to start unleashing hell on you!
[00:38:53.618 --> 00:38:56.679]  But hey, you don't have a care in the world!
[00:38:56.679 --> 00:38:58.540]  Because you've got, uh,
[00:39:00.015 --> 00:39:03.879]  You've got dyed black hair and a big pentagram on your back.
[00:39:03.879 --> 00:39:08.745]  Or you've got the perfect yuppie outfit in a BMW.
[00:39:11.053 --> 00:39:14.576]  And so you've got it all figured out.
[00:39:14.576 --> 00:39:20.300]  The television told you you're doing well because you have these, you have these signets.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:21.361]  You have these logos.
[00:39:21.361 --> 00:39:23.982]  You have these cultural passes.
[00:39:23.982 --> 00:39:25.564]  And you're literally living in a matrix.
[00:39:25.564 --> 00:39:28.586]  That's all I'm trying to, that's all I'm trying to get through to you.
[00:39:28.586 --> 00:39:30.347]  That's all I'm trying to say to you.
[00:39:30.347 --> 00:39:33.309]  And I got all this news here and I'm not trying to be preachy.
[00:39:33.309 --> 00:39:36.371]  It's just, I look at people.
[00:39:36.371 --> 00:39:37.192]  I watch people.
[00:39:38.257 --> 00:39:43.540]  And I've learned, you know, the different mannerisms and the different affectations, the insecurities.
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:48.742]  I've learned to be able to recognize people's insecurities, including my own.
[00:39:48.742 --> 00:39:50.764]  I'm criticizing myself in much of this, folks.
[00:39:50.764 --> 00:39:51.424]  We all do it.
[00:39:51.424 --> 00:39:53.365]  We all have that animal side.
[00:39:53.365 --> 00:39:55.806]  That base side.
[00:39:55.806 --> 00:40:00.128]  I'm just attempting to get you out there to think for yourselves.
[00:40:00.128 --> 00:40:05.211]  And to get kind of above and outside of your primitive state.
[00:40:05.211 --> 00:40:06.752]  Because that's definitely part of us.
[00:40:06.752 --> 00:40:07.072]  But to
[00:40:08.024 --> 00:40:20.047]  Man is the only creature, separation from the animals, who is able to get above his primitive nature and to retrospectively look down into it and observe what it is, and then see that in his fellow men.
[00:40:20.047 --> 00:40:24.748]  And I see these people, these people acting tough, acting stylish.
[00:40:24.748 --> 00:40:27.548]  We're not meant to be peacocks, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:27.548 --> 00:40:33.109]  I mean, birds display to each other and puff up.
[00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:34.610]  And that's really what it comes down to.
[00:40:34.610 --> 00:40:36.530]  I see you puffing up.
[00:40:38.212 --> 00:40:45.614]  I see lots of puffing up and lots of running around and lots of acting stylish and tough and powerful.
[00:40:45.614 --> 00:40:49.054]  And I'm just here to tell you, folks, forget being powerful.
[00:40:49.054 --> 00:40:53.075]  You better want real power to protect yourself.
[00:40:53.075 --> 00:40:57.536]  That's what power is really for, is to protect women and children.
[00:40:57.536 --> 00:41:00.257]  Power isn't something to be abused.
[00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:04.037]  And the symbols of power are not power.
[00:41:04.037 --> 00:41:06.618]  And you've been given false symbols of power.
[00:41:08.115 --> 00:41:09.835]  Perfectly styled.
[00:41:09.835 --> 00:41:13.536]  By the way, the Japanese emperor's handlers wrote about this.
[00:41:13.536 --> 00:41:15.816]  Japanese emperors wrote about this.
[00:41:15.816 --> 00:41:17.197]  Their staff wrote about it.
[00:41:17.197 --> 00:41:18.677]  The Europeans wrote about it.
[00:41:18.677 --> 00:41:33.239]  Don't think for a minute that, you know, a Louis, French king, didn't know that all the fancy new garments and stylish, ridiculous regalia wasn't a social mode of control.
[00:41:33.239 --> 00:41:36.600]  Don't think that they didn't realize it's all ridiculous.
[00:41:38.357 --> 00:41:50.303]  Kings knew 3,000 years ago that big fancy headdresses, crowns, were meant to impress you.
[00:41:50.303 --> 00:41:55.386]  They're manipulating your beef shield animal level.
[00:41:55.386 --> 00:41:55.966]  That's all.
[00:41:55.966 --> 00:41:58.907]  I just get sick of you wearing crowns, folks.
[00:41:58.907 --> 00:41:59.768]  Not because
[00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:04.313]  I mean, I got a three-year-old likes to, you know, dress up like a princess.
[00:42:04.313 --> 00:42:04.814]  That's fine.
[00:42:04.814 --> 00:42:06.434]  They do that when they're three, folks.
[00:42:06.434 --> 00:42:15.158]  I'm just telling women out there, see, you're being frozen in a position, and then when you don't look like a princess anymore when you're 40 years old, then you feel like you have no value.
[00:42:15.158 --> 00:42:17.139]  Madison Avenue did that to you.
[00:42:17.139 --> 00:42:18.460]  Your value as a woman
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:27.464]  Increases the older you get because of the children you have, and because of the families you've built, and the love you have, and then you are worshipped in your family.
[00:42:27.464 --> 00:42:44.371]  No, you've had all that taken away from you, and now you're 45 years old, and your collagen's breaking down, and your connective tissue's starting to disintegrate, and your clock's shutting down, and you think, my God, all I was worth... This is one small microcosm of the overall system I see, you see.
[00:42:45.999 --> 00:43:08.611]  And now, when you should be entering the paramount of your life, the literal center of the family, you, in the name of feminism, went into a trap and have truly been destroyed and have been debased down to nothing but sexual objects.
[00:43:08.611 --> 00:43:10.932]  It's all scientifically done.
[00:43:13.271 --> 00:43:30.855]  And so you're so busy chasing after baubles, men and women, you're taught how you're inadequate when you're five years old, that they can literally program you with total control off of the carrot you're chasing on the end of the stick.
[00:43:30.855 --> 00:43:42.997]  Just like you're a jackass, a donkey, that's got a stick tied around his head, around the bridle, and around the bit, sticking out with a carrot on the end of it.
[00:43:43.542 --> 00:43:48.104]  And I watch you all in bobble outfits with bobbles.
[00:43:48.104 --> 00:43:49.684]  It looks ridiculous.
[00:43:49.684 --> 00:43:55.226]  Bobbles and junk hanging off of you with little crowns.
[00:43:55.226 --> 00:43:59.308]  That's what your little fancinesses are.
[00:43:59.308 --> 00:44:05.130]  With all these little bobbles and crowns on you, dragging all this junk behind you, following a carrot.
[00:44:06.718 --> 00:44:07.419]  Now, let me be clear.
[00:44:07.419 --> 00:44:09.080]  I'm not saying having a nice house is bad.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.143]  I'm not saying having a nice car that runs well and is beautiful and you can't appreciate it.
[00:44:13.143 --> 00:44:23.391]  But when that's your God, when that comes first, when everything is about that, and if you don't have it, boy, you're inadequate.
[00:44:23.391 --> 00:44:33.199]  I literally dream about living in a shack somewhere, a shotgun shack off the back of a river, and working down in some tiny town pumping gas, folks.
[00:44:38.064 --> 00:44:42.771]  And going bird hunting and camping with old vets and stuff like that.
[00:44:42.771 --> 00:44:44.273]  That's fun!
[00:44:44.273 --> 00:44:45.555]  That's good!
[00:44:45.555 --> 00:44:47.217]  That's real people!
[00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:51.904]  Not running around with a bunch of dressed up, painted up, mindless scum!
[00:44:52.654 --> 00:44:54.454]  Who've destroyed my country!
[00:44:54.454 --> 00:45:15.360]  Because we can attack the New World Order all day long, but if you want to know where the real problem is, all you got to do is look into the mirror, and you're going to see the problem staring right back out at you.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:20.841]  You're going to see the problem looking right back out at you.
[00:45:25.512 --> 00:45:30.637]  All right, I'm going to cover news now, and then I'm going to get your calls when we're good and ready.
[00:45:30.637 --> 00:45:34.180]  I want to hear from you, and I love hearing from you, and I want to hear from first-time callers today.
[00:45:34.180 --> 00:45:34.480]  Tell us.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:35.301]  You go to the head of the line.
[00:45:35.301 --> 00:45:37.703]  You can only be trumped by someone who disagrees.
[00:45:37.703 --> 00:45:39.265]  You go to the head of the line before them.
[00:45:39.265 --> 00:45:42.468]  But everybody can call.
[00:45:42.468 --> 00:45:43.489]  I want to hear from everybody at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:45:43.489 --> 00:45:45.230]  We'll start taking calls early in the next hour.
[00:45:45.230 --> 00:45:45.290]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:45:53.809 --> 00:45:57.152]  Let me just again, for those who just joined us, and we will cover every bit of this today.
[00:45:57.152 --> 00:45:58.613]  We're going to cover it.
[00:45:58.613 --> 00:46:03.017]  Fire crew bosses who can't speak Spanish can lose jobs.
[00:46:03.017 --> 00:46:05.279]  English speaker says landlord's message is clear.
[00:46:05.279 --> 00:46:09.762]  If you don't speak Spanish, you're out.
[00:46:09.762 --> 00:46:11.624]  Clerk blames firing on illegals debate.
[00:46:11.624 --> 00:46:12.525]  They fired him.
[00:46:12.525 --> 00:46:18.189]  He was wearing a border patrol hat and they shot at the building at 7-11 and they still fired him.
[00:46:18.189 --> 00:46:22.633]  In Texas TV lockup, that's the illegal alien front, the third world takeover front.
[00:46:23.906 --> 00:46:26.068]  Oh, the middle class thinks they'll fight the elite?
[00:46:26.068 --> 00:46:35.214]  We'll just flood them with unlimited third world and we'll nationalistically pop up the third worlders and have them by double standard economically for economic warfare!
[00:46:35.214 --> 00:46:37.296]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:46:37.296 --> 00:46:39.557]  And the yuppies won't even fight back!
[00:46:39.557 --> 00:46:40.958]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:46:40.958 --> 00:46:44.141]  They're too busy adjusting their rings!
[00:46:44.141 --> 00:46:46.762]  Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:46:46.762 --> 00:46:47.303]  Look at them!
[00:46:55.746 --> 00:46:59.547]  Put-in-mouth virus released from government lab.
[00:46:59.547 --> 00:47:01.668]  Cell phone FBI can listen to you when your phone is off.
[00:47:01.668 --> 00:47:04.989]  I thought I'd bring this back because Drudge has the headline, No More Warrants.
[00:47:04.989 --> 00:47:08.370]  And that's right, if you actually read the bill, it's just no more warrants in America.
[00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:10.110]  They publicly announced it.
[00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:11.491]  It's a bit wide in calls.
[00:47:11.491 --> 00:47:15.172]  We can listen.
[00:47:15.172 --> 00:47:16.512]  It's hilarious.
[00:47:16.512 --> 00:47:17.433]  I have another video clip.
[00:47:17.433 --> 00:47:17.673]  U.S.
[00:47:17.673 --> 00:47:19.633]  military may implant chips in troops' brains.
[00:47:19.633 --> 00:47:21.134]  Now it's on the news.
[00:47:21.134 --> 00:47:21.734]  How great it is.
[00:47:23.005 --> 00:47:29.231]  Uh, this, uh, Gaddan known Mossad agent running around saying Al-Qaeda's gonna get us any minute.
[00:47:29.231 --> 00:47:32.634]  American Home files for bankruptcy after shutdown.
[00:47:32.634 --> 00:47:35.777]  This is the, uh, second biggest mortgage company in the U.S.
[00:47:35.777 --> 00:47:37.759]  Bankrupt!
[00:47:37.759 --> 00:47:38.960]  Oh, everything's fine.
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:43.304]  Everything's... Everything's wonderful right now, let me tell you.
[00:47:43.304 --> 00:47:46.908]  When we get back from break, I'm gonna just walk through very briefly the timeline
[00:47:47.569 --> 00:47:48.790]  And then there's a lot of other points.
[00:47:48.790 --> 00:47:51.211]  We're going to write a timeline today or tomorrow.
[00:47:51.211 --> 00:47:53.313]  And I hope this is a very important timeline.
[00:47:53.313 --> 00:48:00.898]  I hope you'll get the tyranny timeline out to everyone.
[00:48:00.898 --> 00:48:03.359]  Because it is of the utmost importance.
[00:48:03.359 --> 00:48:11.605]  Before we go to break, now is the time to engage in the info war like your very life depends on it.
[00:48:11.605 --> 00:48:16.308]  And if you go to prisonplanet.tv, let's say you've already got a prisonplanet.tv 15-cent-a-day membership.
[00:48:16.764 --> 00:48:21.966]  That just helps us pay for the webmasters and the bandwidth and the rest of it.
[00:48:21.966 --> 00:48:27.307]  You can download TerrorStorm 2nd Edition Final Cut in super high quality.
[00:48:27.307 --> 00:48:29.028]  It looks almost as good as television.
[00:48:29.028 --> 00:48:31.009]  Occasionally there might be a little blip or something.
[00:48:31.009 --> 00:48:36.790]  But it's very crystal, very pretty, very nice, very clear.
[00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:38.671]  Brilliant!
[00:48:38.671 --> 00:48:41.632]  And you can just download it and burn it to normal CDs all day long.
[00:48:43.445 --> 00:48:45.787]  And you can burn a couple by drinking coffee at 6 a.m.
[00:48:45.787 --> 00:48:46.507]  about to go to work.
[00:48:46.507 --> 00:48:52.050]  When you get home at 5, 6, you can sit there and burn copies.
[00:48:52.050 --> 00:49:00.155]  And you just hand them out at work, or you put them on car windshields, or you give them to your neighbor, or you say, hey man, to your neighbor, this is some pretty interesting stuff.
[00:49:00.155 --> 00:49:01.196]  Give me your opinion on this.
[00:49:02.461 --> 00:49:03.022]  What do you think of this?
[00:49:03.022 --> 00:49:03.822]  This is some pretty wild stuff.
[00:49:03.822 --> 00:49:05.464]  I wanted to get your input.
[00:49:05.464 --> 00:49:10.449]  That way you're not even socially... How do you... I mean, you're facing death, and we're facing extermination here.
[00:49:10.449 --> 00:49:15.634]  These people killed 200 mil last century, but you know... You don't want your neighbor to think you're a kook.
[00:49:15.634 --> 00:49:17.096]  We're going outside the comfort zone.
[00:49:17.096 --> 00:49:20.940]  So just say, what do you think of this?
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:26.045]  You know, they're only announcing domestic spies to, quote, fight crime under FBI control, and they're only announcing, uh...
[00:49:26.764 --> 00:49:31.925]  Forced inoculations and all the rest of this stuff, and they've only recruited preachers in every county in the U.S.
[00:49:31.925 --> 00:49:36.526]  to quote, spy on their congregations and tell them to turn their guns in when the time comes.
[00:49:36.526 --> 00:49:37.667]  I mean, that's admitted.
[00:49:37.667 --> 00:49:46.389]  The President's only announced he's above the law and above Congress, literally, publicly.
[00:49:46.389 --> 00:49:51.310]  Why not get involved?
[00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:53.251]  Why not?
[00:49:53.251 --> 00:49:54.831]  Because believe me, I mean, this is like
[00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:57.000]  You're about to fall off a cliff.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:57.761]  We're all about to fall off.
[00:49:57.761 --> 00:49:59.923]  And all I'm saying is, hey, let's not fall off.
[00:49:59.923 --> 00:50:02.345]  Let's screen bloody murder every day.
[00:50:02.345 --> 00:50:03.446]  Call into talk shows.
[00:50:03.446 --> 00:50:05.247]  Post on websites.
[00:50:05.247 --> 00:50:06.649]  I mean, go nuts, folks.
[00:50:06.649 --> 00:50:08.670]  I mean, get aggressive.
[00:50:08.670 --> 00:50:11.273]  I mean, put in ten hours a day on this.
[00:50:11.273 --> 00:50:12.794]  This is the fight.
[00:50:12.794 --> 00:50:13.895]  This is not a joke.
[00:50:13.895 --> 00:50:14.696]  This is not a drill.
[00:50:14.696 --> 00:50:15.837]  This is not a game.
[00:50:15.837 --> 00:50:18.940]  You're gonna wish later you'd have fought these murderers.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:19.861]  They're coming to kill us.
[00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:30.714]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:50:30.714 --> 00:50:38.359]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:50:39.033 --> 00:50:46.497]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:50:46.497 --> 00:50:58.224]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:50:58.224 --> 00:51:02.186]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:51:02.186 --> 00:51:04.468]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:51:04.468 --> 00:51:08.310]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.862]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:52:23.862 --> 00:52:25.343]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:52:25.343 --> 00:52:28.545]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:31.848]  What part of unconstitutional do not understand, George?
[00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:39.133]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:53:43.628 --> 00:53:48.329]  Fox News, on a weekly basis, attacks me by name now.
[00:53:48.329 --> 00:53:52.831]  I have become a meme, or a signpost, or a buzzword.
[00:53:52.831 --> 00:53:55.652]  And, I don't know, three or four times in the last month, they've attacked Ron Paul.
[00:53:55.652 --> 00:53:56.932]  They did it yesterday in person.
[00:53:56.932 --> 00:53:59.853]  Later, I'm going to play that clip.
[00:53:59.853 --> 00:54:01.774]  We don't have the whole clip, though, because people call me about it.
[00:54:01.774 --> 00:54:04.415]  They go to break, and then NewsHounds cuts it off there.
[00:54:04.415 --> 00:54:07.556]  We haven't been able to find the clip when he was... Oh, you have the full clip now?
[00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:09.111]  You're able to find it?
[00:54:09.111 --> 00:54:09.971]  Okay, then later.
[00:54:09.971 --> 00:54:12.173]  You know where they come back from break?
[00:54:12.173 --> 00:54:13.394]  Okay, good.
[00:54:13.394 --> 00:54:14.354]  Okay, cool.
[00:54:14.354 --> 00:54:15.155]  I only have the first part.
[00:54:15.155 --> 00:54:17.476]  I'll hand that to Paul Watson so he can get it posted.
[00:54:17.476 --> 00:54:19.098]  Thanks.
[00:54:19.098 --> 00:54:25.142]  Because in our top story at prisonbrunner.com about it, I don't... We only have the first part of the clip.
[00:54:25.142 --> 00:54:27.423]  They come back from break and keep bringing it up.
[00:54:27.423 --> 00:54:28.784]  And I've seen a transcript out there.
[00:54:28.784 --> 00:54:31.166]  I wonder where... Ron Paul said, look, I go on his show.
[00:54:31.166 --> 00:54:31.727]  He supports me.
[00:54:31.727 --> 00:54:32.787]  I support him.
[00:54:32.787 --> 00:54:34.068]  I don't have to agree with everything he says.
[00:54:34.068 --> 00:54:36.430]  I don't agree with everything on this Fox News show, but I'm here.
[00:54:37.182 --> 00:54:42.286]  And they come up and go, you say there could be false flag terror attacks.
[00:54:42.286 --> 00:54:46.029]  He did give a speech saying they could have a Gulf of Tonkin event.
[00:54:46.029 --> 00:54:51.194]  He has said, quote, I'm worried about a staged provocation, but not particularly a 9-11.
[00:54:51.194 --> 00:54:54.497]  And that's fine, we understand why Ron Paul's doing that and saying that.
[00:54:54.497 --> 00:55:02.163]  The point is, is that, I mean, when you've got Fox News, folks, because I know what they are, it's not a band of moronic, fake conservatives.
[00:55:02.163 --> 00:55:04.005]  I mean, these are hardcore people.
[00:55:04.005 --> 00:55:05.466]  They know they're destroying America.
[00:55:06.272 --> 00:55:09.753]  Fox News knows the NAU is real.
[00:55:09.753 --> 00:55:11.973]  They know they're selling everybody on Big Brother.
[00:55:11.973 --> 00:55:16.354]  I mean, you really watch that channel, it's extremely wicked.
[00:55:16.354 --> 00:55:27.877]  And of course, it now has been confirmed Kansas City Star, what we already had seen, I never confirmed it, that Dick Cheney was the press secretary for Senator Ted Kennedy.
[00:55:27.877 --> 00:55:29.797]  But that's all being kept real quiet.
[00:55:30.644 --> 00:55:35.187]  I mean, the Clinton's vacation with Bush, they hang out with him before Clinton ever got elected.
[00:55:35.187 --> 00:55:36.627]  I mean, this is staged, okay?
[00:55:36.627 --> 00:55:38.609]  At that level, it's staged.
[00:55:38.609 --> 00:55:42.631]  And Fox and the rest of them at the high levels, they know they're killing this country.
[00:55:42.631 --> 00:55:59.040]  And they claimed it was a viewer email, but then they'd done other Fox News reports about it earlier, so then she goes into, well, the headline says this, well, you said this and that, and she was all versed in it, and it was not a viewer email, but they like to make it look like it came from, oh, just spontaneously, one more thing, Congressman, this Alex Jones,
[00:56:01.013 --> 00:56:01.694]  Let me tell you something.
[00:56:01.694 --> 00:56:02.835]  Careful what you wish for.
[00:56:02.835 --> 00:56:06.498]  A lot of you out there want to be called out by the New World Order.
[00:56:06.498 --> 00:56:08.739]  A lot of you want to have the New World Order's attention on you.
[00:56:08.739 --> 00:56:10.521]  A lot of you want to be big shots and all this.
[00:56:10.521 --> 00:56:12.622]  Believe me, it's not fun.
[00:56:12.622 --> 00:56:14.064]  And it is not a good feeling.
[00:56:14.064 --> 00:56:16.125]  It is a melancholy feeling.
[00:56:16.125 --> 00:56:23.071]  It is a very cold feeling to have the New World Order watching you, listening to you, tracking you.
[00:56:23.071 --> 00:56:23.892]  And I never talk about it.
[00:56:23.892 --> 00:56:26.754]  I never give it attention and the weird stuff I've been through and the things that have happened.
[00:56:27.563 --> 00:56:31.165]  But the point is, is that it lets you know just how real this is.
[00:56:31.165 --> 00:56:39.210]  And I literally, folks, do say the Lord's Prayer, because we walk through the valley of the shadow of death, and I fear no evil, for thou art with me.
[00:56:39.210 --> 00:56:41.511]  And God does comfort me.
[00:56:41.511 --> 00:56:45.293]  And, but just know this, I am in the dragon's lair, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:56:45.293 --> 00:56:47.895]  I am facing down the dragon.
[00:56:47.895 --> 00:56:50.716]  And I will probably be torn limb from limb.
[00:56:50.716 --> 00:56:53.698]  But it is the exercise of resistance that matters.
[00:56:53.698 --> 00:56:55.459]  And that's when God intervenes.
[00:56:55.459 --> 00:56:56.620]  When you do put yourself in
[00:56:58.636 --> 00:57:00.217]  And I can feel your prayers.
[00:57:00.217 --> 00:57:04.741]  And I do need your prayers, ladies and gentlemen, because the enemy is fully aware.
[00:57:04.741 --> 00:57:09.684]  I mean, other people just call Fox propaganda or they're right-wingers.
[00:57:09.684 --> 00:57:11.686]  Folks, they're not any wing.
[00:57:11.686 --> 00:57:13.227]  They are, bring the U.S.
[00:57:13.227 --> 00:57:15.648]  down, pro-world government.
[00:57:15.648 --> 00:57:21.933]  They're here to sell you on taking your pension funds, your bank accounts, your mortgages.
[00:57:21.933 --> 00:57:27.337]  They're here to strap you down and anesthetize you while they suck your blood like a spider.
[00:57:28.590 --> 00:57:33.615]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:57:39.042 --> 00:57:42.265]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:57:42.265 --> 00:57:45.368]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:57:45.368 --> 00:57:51.954]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:57:51.954 --> 00:57:59.440]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:03.364]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:58:03.404 --> 00:58:04.264]  We're good to go.
[00:58:31.494 --> 00:58:32.715]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:58:52.953 --> 00:58:54.254]  Big Brother.
[00:58:54.254 --> 00:58:56.035]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:56.035 --> 00:58:57.795]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:57.795 --> 00:58:59.356]  You want answers?
[00:58:59.356 --> 00:59:00.917]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:00.917 --> 00:59:05.119]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:05.119 --> 00:59:09.221]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:29.812]  I started down the path to fight the New World Order many years ago, even before I consciously knew I was on the path.
[00:59:29.812 --> 00:59:33.153]  I was on it firmly.
[00:59:33.153 --> 00:59:36.214]  And I had no idea how truly wicked our enemies were.
[00:59:36.214 --> 00:59:39.635]  I didn't know what true wickedness was.
[00:59:39.635 --> 00:59:46.577]  I've been given the false template of wickedness by the corporate media, by the structure.
[00:59:46.577 --> 00:59:48.918]  I didn't know it was basically selfishness.
[00:59:49.822 --> 01:00:00.649]  and sadistic enjoyment of and jealousy and envy and avarice to the point of where the elite wish to hurt and maim and kill masses just because they hate your decency.
[01:00:00.649 --> 01:00:13.638]  Oh, we've got big financial news, we've got war news, we've got government terror attack news, but first I'm going to take your calls.
[01:00:13.638 --> 01:00:15.760]  But I've been promising to get into a
[01:00:19.941 --> 01:00:22.882]  A timeline.
[01:00:22.882 --> 01:00:24.683]  A martial law timeline.
[01:00:24.683 --> 01:00:31.825]  I've told Paul Watson this morning, when he gets back from dinner this evening, he's going to write it up, he said.
[01:00:31.825 --> 01:00:41.928]  But I want it to be good, and maybe you should email, why don't you email Aaron at InfoWars.com right now with your suggestions, or even better, because I mean,
[01:00:42.614 --> 01:01:00.607]  Paul's going to listen to this interview, he's going to think of examples of the terror timeline that he wants to add, and then it's kind of a collective effort here, and then we're going to put it out tonight or tomorrow, the tyranny timeline.
[01:01:00.607 --> 01:01:06.071]  And so you can also callers who are listening on whatever you're calling in about, would you indulge me?
[01:01:07.416 --> 01:01:12.619]  And perhaps give me your example, because there's so many, I'll never be able to really think of them all.
[01:01:12.619 --> 01:01:20.883]  Yesterday afternoon I had the idea that we need to put out a tyranny timeline, and how they're terrorizing us.
[01:01:20.883 --> 01:01:23.005]  And we can go back into the midst of times.
[01:01:23.005 --> 01:01:29.268]  You know, America's, the tyranny timeline, the United States' journey from liberty to absolute despotism.
[01:01:31.141 --> 01:01:33.402]  Maybe that'd be the story headline.
[01:01:33.402 --> 01:01:45.849]  You know we can start back with the Civil War and show many scholars believe this is when federalism was clearly asserted and when federal power over the states illegitimately, illegitimately clearly from the
[01:01:48.334 --> 01:01:58.688]  Founder's statements, the Bill of Rights, Constitution, Declaration of Independence, but that was really thrown off by the states, not just the southern states but the northern states, by the late 1870s.
[01:01:58.688 --> 01:02:04.075]  It was resisted and Posse Comitatus was put into place in 1878 to bar that.
[01:02:08.556 --> 01:02:18.071]  And then the banks, feverishly, the British banks particularly, came in and financed the new robber-bearing class in the railroads to try to control Western expansion and consolidate.
[01:02:18.071 --> 01:02:21.096]  They did to a great extent, and just in the next 40 years or so,
[01:02:25.777 --> 01:02:45.205]  By 1913, we're able to take over the issuance of the currency and credit in this country, and to have regulatory power over different disparate banks and different subsections of the financial structure that was extremely diversified and somewhat wildcat, of course, and speculative, but still free.
[01:02:45.205 --> 01:02:49.327]  That was why we had 25% growth rate some years.
[01:02:49.327 --> 01:02:50.988]  Oh, it was freedom, and it was wild.
[01:02:52.657 --> 01:02:57.280]  And so it took them a long time to reign that in and consolidate it.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:00.222]  Then they engineered a mass crash in 1929.
[01:03:00.222 --> 01:03:15.631]  They promised to bring in the Federal Reserve to end booms and busts that were localized and the economy was so diversified that it never caused even regional problems, silver runs and other bank problems.
[01:03:15.631 --> 01:03:18.253]  It was really up to you to make the proper investment.
[01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:20.494]  Then they came in, took over, and a few years later gave us the
[01:03:21.437 --> 01:03:25.458]  We're going to walk through the tyranny timeline.
[01:03:25.458 --> 01:03:30.019]  And you'll notice that with Oklahoma City and the 9-11, everything accelerates.
[01:03:30.019 --> 01:03:38.221]  And what took 50 years, 60, 70, 80 years to develop, tyranny-wise, could be dwarfed in just a few years.
[01:03:38.221 --> 01:03:41.142]  So I'll briefly walk through this, and then we'll take your calls.
[01:03:51.847 --> 01:03:55.353]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:03:55.353 --> 01:03:57.657]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[01:03:57.657 --> 01:04:05.310]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:04:05.999 --> 01:04:13.442]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:04:13.442 --> 01:04:25.186]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:04:25.186 --> 01:04:29.127]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:04:29.127 --> 01:04:31.408]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:04:31.408 --> 01:04:35.249]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:04:48.732 --> 01:04:49.653]  Terrorism.
[01:04:49.653 --> 01:04:50.513]  Terrorism.
[01:04:50.513 --> 01:04:56.838]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:04:56.838 --> 01:04:58.679]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:04:58.679 --> 01:05:01.541]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:01.541 --> 01:05:16.151]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:16.151 --> 01:05:16.632]  government.
[01:05:16.632 --> 01:05:18.373]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:18.593 --> 01:05:24.857]  Yes, it's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:24.857 --> 01:05:29.619]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:56.942]  Did you know that we ingest toxins and harsh chemicals every day from the foods and alcohol we consume, the water we drink, and the OTCs and prescription medications we take?
[01:05:56.942 --> 01:06:03.126]  Thankfully, our liver neutralizes the effects of these toxins and eliminates them from our bodies before they can do too much damage.
[01:06:03.786 --> 01:06:11.372]  The fact is, the liver performs over 500 vital functions in the body, from aiding digestion to removing toxins and maintaining good health.

[01:06:39.773 --> 01:06:41.074]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:06:41.074 --> 01:06:42.154]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:42.154 --> 01:06:43.355]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.313 --> 01:07:08.237]  Alright, Jeff, Mario, Wendy, William.
[01:07:08.237 --> 01:07:08.678]  Who's that?
[01:07:08.678 --> 01:07:10.520]  Who's on line 5?
[01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:19.348]  Liz and others, your calls are coming up here in a few minutes and open phones throughout the next two hours, roughly.
[01:07:19.348 --> 01:07:23.833]  I got a bunch of other audio clips and a ton of other news, but let me just finish up with the tyranny timeline.
[01:07:28.448 --> 01:07:34.655]  So we get the Civil War and there's some serious federal oppression that comes as a result during Reconstruction.
[01:07:34.655 --> 01:07:38.419]  That is reversed.
[01:07:38.419 --> 01:07:47.209]  And then the private banks that Andrew Jackson and others had fought off take over in 1913.
[01:07:49.210 --> 01:07:57.677]  And then they engineer the Great Depression, which is now declassified, admitted, and public knowledge for anybody who studies the economy of this nation in the last hundred years.
[01:07:57.677 --> 01:07:59.519]  That's all engineered.
[01:07:59.519 --> 01:08:07.746]  And after about two and a half, three years, people are ready for something, and they'll do anything.
[01:08:07.746 --> 01:08:14.792]  And at the same time, there's a move towards fascism in the country, but instead we get socialism, and in comes Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
[01:08:16.650 --> 01:08:30.102]  And when he first gets elected, he puts in a national executive order, the War Powers Act of 1933, in the depth of the Depression.
[01:08:30.102 --> 01:08:32.564]  That's the deepest point.
[01:08:32.564 --> 01:08:34.726]  And he says, I'm federalizing the states.
[01:08:34.726 --> 01:08:36.147]  You have to turn all your gold in.
[01:08:36.147 --> 01:08:38.309]  You can only keep one wedding ring.
[01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:41.012]  You're allowed a certain gram weight.
[01:08:41.898 --> 01:08:43.038]  All the gold must be turned in.
[01:08:43.038 --> 01:08:46.539]  You'll be given new Federal Reserve notes back.
[01:08:46.539 --> 01:08:59.062]  They were given the notes, in some cases silver certificates, and then one year later they pulled a currency scam, double the price of gold, but it had already been shipped to private hands in Europe.
[01:08:59.062 --> 01:09:00.222]  That's mainstream.
[01:09:00.222 --> 01:09:03.823]  You can go read the War Powers Act of 1933.
[01:09:03.823 --> 01:09:10.684]  They chartered the Federal Police, but they know the people won't go along with it, so they call it State Police.
[01:09:12.401 --> 01:09:18.003]  And if you'll look, you get all your state police from 1933 to 1937.
[01:09:18.003 --> 01:09:24.266]  All the states at the time get their federal police with federal money by the late 1930s.
[01:09:24.266 --> 01:09:26.027]  Texas, what was chartered in 36.
[01:09:26.027 --> 01:09:31.309]  And the poor people don't even know, the cops themselves don't know they're really federal.
[01:09:31.309 --> 01:09:33.049]  So they put them in.
[01:09:33.049 --> 01:09:34.430]  They have make work programs.
[01:09:34.430 --> 01:09:35.711]  They get everybody on welfare.
[01:09:35.711 --> 01:09:37.531]  A lot of people on welfare.
[01:09:37.531 --> 01:09:38.952]  That idea comes into place.
[01:09:39.756 --> 01:09:46.499]  And back then, they built roads and built dams, and actually, the government still had the idea of building infrastructure.
[01:09:46.499 --> 01:09:48.980]  As bad as they were, they did something real.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:55.783]  Now, when they're doing it, they're going to do the same thing they've announced, but it's going to be spying, tattling, running FEMA camps, spying on people.
[01:09:55.783 --> 01:10:01.205]  I mean, they're announcing the new make-work's going to be that, being in the military.
[01:10:01.205 --> 01:10:03.586]  But I digress.
[01:10:03.586 --> 01:10:06.467]  So we get the War Powers Act.
[01:10:07.347 --> 01:10:07.987]  Of 33.
[01:10:07.987 --> 01:10:09.728]  Then we have World War II.
[01:10:09.728 --> 01:10:12.848]  A bunch of police state actions are carried out there.
[01:10:12.848 --> 01:10:16.389]  Of course, I skipped over another key line.
[01:10:16.389 --> 01:10:32.032]  In 1918, or in World War I, there was the trading with the Enemy Act, and then the reissuance of it, and then the reissuance of the Sedition Act, which had almost caused another revolution 170-something years earlier,
[01:10:36.663 --> 01:10:49.792]  Right after the country had been founded for just a few years, they tried to set up a police state, and there was a big march on Washington, an unarmed march, and a big rebellion, and a bunch of duels out in the streets, and the British were trying to take over then, and they had to back off.
[01:10:49.792 --> 01:10:52.714]  Again, they were saying, no one's allowed to protest the government.
[01:10:52.714 --> 01:10:57.858]  So they had the Sedition Act then, but that got removed, but they reissued trading with the enemy and the Sedition Act.
[01:10:58.559 --> 01:11:02.302]  Which Michael Savage always calls for now, you know, arresting anyone.
[01:11:02.302 --> 01:11:25.560]  I remember about three years ago, this is later on the timeline, but just as I think of these I'll bring them up, we had the governor of Rhode Island, it was in the Rhode Island newspaper and also the local TV station, said, yeah, criticizing the government's now illegal and you will be arrested and put in prison for criticizing the government.
[01:11:26.610 --> 01:11:32.594]  And then people actually marched on the Capitol there in Providence, and he said, OK, the Feds asked me to pass it.
[01:11:32.594 --> 01:11:33.094]  I was wrong.
[01:11:33.094 --> 01:11:33.974]  I hadn't read it.
[01:11:33.974 --> 01:11:37.476]  And then they tried the same thing in Oregon with that bill.
[01:11:37.476 --> 01:11:38.517]  Hundreds of things were listed.
[01:11:38.517 --> 01:11:43.700]  Downloading music, having a gun illegally, life in a forced labor camp.
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:45.461]  It actually said, forced labor camp.
[01:11:45.461 --> 01:11:46.382]  That's a quote.
[01:11:46.382 --> 01:11:47.802]  Forced labor camp.
[01:11:47.802 --> 01:11:51.985]  A bunch of other people tried to pass it.
[01:11:53.544 --> 01:11:54.324]  But I digress.
[01:11:54.324 --> 01:12:01.466]  Okay, so they just reissue the same stuff, but now they've got the muscle to at least attempt it.
[01:12:01.466 --> 01:12:09.748]  And so, we're brought to 1933, then World War II, police state, a lot of police state stuff goes on, then 1947 National Security Act.
[01:12:09.748 --> 01:12:15.150]  Now, the private banks and the private opium traders that set up Skull and Bones
[01:12:16.025 --> 01:12:18.886]  And that's mainstream history, by the way, for those that don't think Skull & Bones exists.
[01:12:18.886 --> 01:12:31.488]  Not just that it exists, but that Skull & Bones, literally with British Intel, this is History Channel now, found, and mainstream news admits that, founded the CIA.
[01:12:31.488 --> 01:12:42.470]  The entire government, real apparatchik, goes underground and secret, and then black ops programs accelerate, they start getting tens of billions a year, in 1947 money, that's trillions now.
[01:12:44.850 --> 01:12:51.954]  And they start aggressively taking over the states, putting in their mayors, putting in their intelligence people everywhere.
[01:12:51.954 --> 01:12:56.957]  In 1953, they set up the Chicago 1313 nationwide.
[01:12:56.957 --> 01:13:12.527]  Chicago, with its mafia, learned how to take government investments in tax money and bonds, and invested in select Chicago and New York based, and then Canada, Toronto based, liquor running, drugs, construction,
[01:13:15.587 --> 01:13:17.688]  And they did it all above board, at least on the surface.
[01:13:17.688 --> 01:13:22.591]  Oh, we're just making investments with bonds instead of spending bond money.
[01:13:22.591 --> 01:13:23.572]  That goes nationwide.
[01:13:23.572 --> 01:13:25.093]  They already had it for 20 years.
[01:13:25.093 --> 01:13:26.694]  The Chicago 1313 model goes nationwide in 1952-53.
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:43.587]  They set up a National Association of Counties, National Association of City Managers, National Association of Governors, to then implement this federalization and control.
[01:13:43.587 --> 01:13:53.595]  The school districts, the water districts, start investing upwards of 70 plus percent of their money, your tax dollars, in now to offshore corporations to fully fund the world government.
[01:13:53.595 --> 01:13:57.298]  That was already a tax for world government then.
[01:13:57.298 --> 01:13:58.719]  They take over from that point.
[01:14:02.518 --> 01:14:31.122]  Then they start developing the National Security Agency, then they set up another 25 at least, there's several other now that have been declassified, secret federal agencies to spy the government engineers, the Vietnam War, for war profits, but also then they put out the ingredients list for LSD, speed, a lot of other drugs to then create the counterculture, then they start having the war on drugs, they start expanding and arresting people, getting them into the system,
[01:14:32.808 --> 01:14:42.636]  They start pushing Ritalin by the 70s, and then Prozac by the 80s, getting now upwards of 20 percent, I've been saying 15, it's now upwards of 20, on the legal drugs.
[01:14:42.636 --> 01:14:45.718]  That's also part of their war.
[01:14:45.718 --> 01:14:58.408]  I forgot that, of course, through British social workers and British intelligence and financing, by 1910, if you go back in the timeline, they set up the first social workers and county and city health departments that were really federal.
[01:14:58.408 --> 01:15:02.391]  Those were some of the first federal nodes, even before the Great Society.
[01:15:05.945 --> 01:15:09.907]  Well, that was the Great Society, was in the 60s, the New Deal.
[01:15:09.907 --> 01:15:11.128]  Excuse me, get those mixed up.
[01:15:11.128 --> 01:15:13.469]  That's phase two of that.
[01:15:13.469 --> 01:15:22.034]  They set up health departments for forced sterilizations, also to quietly kill children who were deformed or that they dubbed mentally ill.
[01:15:22.034 --> 01:15:25.916]  They would also tie people down if they were mentally ill, and adults, and let them starve to death.
[01:15:25.916 --> 01:15:27.797]  It was actually murder.
[01:15:27.797 --> 01:15:30.619]  Very grisly for them, but they believed if you didn't actively do it, it wasn't killing.
[01:15:31.614 --> 01:15:32.975]  So I forgot about that police state.
[01:15:32.975 --> 01:15:38.457]  That creates the nodes of the social workers that are going to create the new socialism.
[01:15:38.457 --> 01:15:39.698]  Which is, again, not for the people.
[01:15:39.698 --> 01:15:41.539]  The elites said it was actually to dumb down the population.
[01:15:41.539 --> 01:15:43.319]  So I forgot that key police state development.
[01:15:43.319 --> 01:15:45.901]  So there's hundreds of these, but these are the basics.
[01:15:45.901 --> 01:15:52.363]  So just, Paul, as you listen to this, you can go back and then stick this back in the timeline.
[01:15:52.363 --> 01:15:56.645]  And then they bring us up... I mean, there's so many examples.
[01:15:56.645 --> 01:15:57.826]  Let me just move forward here.
[01:15:59.311 --> 01:16:02.672]  In the 1980s, the war on drugs gets publicly announced.
[01:16:02.672 --> 01:16:08.675]  They begin federalizing police by lobbying the state legislatures to pass laws.
[01:16:08.675 --> 01:16:10.415]  The feds lobbied.
[01:16:10.415 --> 01:16:11.776]  And spent millions.
[01:16:11.776 --> 01:16:13.797]  The feds lobbying at the state level.
[01:16:13.797 --> 01:16:14.817]  Almost every state passed this.
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.721]  I say almost everyone we've looked at.
[01:16:17.721 --> 01:16:20.704]  I believe all 50 have it.
[01:16:20.704 --> 01:16:23.667]  There's one state in memory that does.
[01:16:23.667 --> 01:16:38.182]  49 states pass a law where if the state seizes drugs, or if locals seize drugs, or vehicles, or houses, or boats, or jewelry in association, or property in association with it, that
[01:16:39.312 --> 01:16:43.013]  The cops can't keep any of it if they give it to the state fund.
[01:16:43.013 --> 01:16:46.173]  But if it's given to the feds, they get 20% back.
[01:16:46.173 --> 01:16:48.234]  Automatically federalizing cops.
[01:16:48.234 --> 01:16:50.374]  You think the feds liked you to do that?
[01:16:50.374 --> 01:16:55.555]  They lobbied so you couldn't keep it locally, you buffoons!
[01:16:55.555 --> 01:16:57.015]  Okay?
[01:16:57.015 --> 01:17:00.896]  Then they start asset forfeiture seizure, and you've seen it thousands of cases.
[01:17:00.896 --> 01:17:03.096]  Famous case up in Waco.
[01:17:03.096 --> 01:17:06.797]  It turns out it was a wealthy oil baroness, that's why they got in a lot of trouble for it.
[01:17:07.432 --> 01:17:08.713]  She's driving along in her Cadillac.
[01:17:08.713 --> 01:17:10.893]  She's got four grand in the glove compartment.
[01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:13.435]  She's an old lady, seventy-something years old.
[01:17:13.435 --> 01:17:15.896]  And they pull her over in her brand new Cadillac and goes, I want to search.
[01:17:15.896 --> 01:17:16.576]  She goes, go ahead.
[01:17:16.576 --> 01:17:18.557]  He goes, I'm just taking your money.
[01:17:18.557 --> 01:17:19.637]  You're not allowed to have this.
[01:17:19.637 --> 01:17:20.618]  It could be drug-related.
[01:17:20.618 --> 01:17:23.899]  And she went and sued them and they got in a lot of trouble.
[01:17:23.899 --> 01:17:24.699]  Just north of Waco.
[01:17:24.699 --> 01:17:26.120]  That was the state police.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:30.502]  And it was in the news that they said, well, you're not allowed to have that much cash.
[01:17:30.502 --> 01:17:31.502]  She wasn't arrested.
[01:17:31.502 --> 01:17:32.442]  She wasn't ticketed.
[01:17:32.442 --> 01:17:33.443]  But he took it because
[01:17:34.153 --> 01:17:44.102]  The famous case of over half the bars in several districts of Seattle are owned by cops, because they sell drugs to each other in the stall, and then come and seize beautiful restaurants.
[01:17:44.102 --> 01:17:47.705]  No judge, no jury, no arrest, they just take it and the cops move in and run it.
[01:17:47.705 --> 01:17:59.756]  By the way, again, I grew up in Rockwall, Texas, and down the hill from us, in a five-bedroom house, was a prominent FBI agent who had retired, and he retired right when he seized this house from a cocaine dealer, and folks, he moved right into it.
[01:17:59.756 --> 01:18:01.117]  And he lived there the whole time I lived there.
[01:18:03.985 --> 01:18:09.789]  I played golf with him a couple times when I was... because it was a golf course in our neighborhood.
[01:18:09.789 --> 01:18:11.731]  Okay?
[01:18:11.731 --> 01:18:17.735]  I played golf with FBI agents when I was 12 years old, ladies and gentlemen, that stole houses!
[01:18:17.735 --> 01:18:18.856]  For themselves!
[01:18:18.856 --> 01:18:21.278]  They move into them personally!
[01:18:21.278 --> 01:18:29.824]  Alright, we'll be right back after this break.
[01:18:29.824 --> 01:18:32.786]  And I'm gonna continue with the timeline right up until...
[01:18:34.085 --> 01:18:37.130]  PDD 51, and I promise we're going to get to your calls.
[01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:37.711]  Stay with us.
[01:18:37.711 --> 01:18:38.412]  It is Monday.
[01:18:38.412 --> 01:18:40.315]  This is vital information.
[01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:42.739]  To know where you're going, you've got to know where you come from.
[01:18:42.739 --> 01:18:43.821]  We'll be right back.

[01:19:48.874 --> 01:19:49.955]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:19:49.955 --> 01:19:54.899]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:19:54.899 --> 01:20:02.965]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:20:02.965 --> 01:20:08.549]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:20:08.549 --> 01:20:15.534]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:20:15.814 --> 01:20:21.419]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:20:21.419 --> 01:20:26.483]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[01:20:26.483 --> 01:20:34.069]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:40.973]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[01:20:40.973 --> 01:20:42.154]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:42.154 --> 01:20:42.354]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:48.467 --> 01:20:51.569]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[01:20:51.569 --> 01:20:57.091]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[01:20:57.091 --> 01:21:02.794]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:21:02.794 --> 01:21:04.295]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:21:04.295 --> 01:21:13.159]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[01:21:13.599 --> 01:21:15.442]  Now compare a Calbin Pure Soap.
[01:21:15.442 --> 01:21:19.667]  All natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal testing.
[01:21:19.667 --> 01:21:24.673]  They're safe and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products now.
[01:21:24.673 --> 01:21:28.538]  Start saving over $1,000 a year for your family of four.
[01:21:28.538 --> 01:21:29.619]  Keep it natural.
[01:21:29.619 --> 01:21:30.741]  Call Calbin Pure Soap
[01:21:31.461 --> 01:21:37.986]  Call for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com.
[01:21:37.986 --> 01:21:42.149]  Try Cal Bend Pure Soaps and I'll bet you'll never use any other cleaning products again.
[01:21:42.149 --> 01:21:43.209]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[01:21:48.712 --> 01:21:51.754]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:51.754 --> 01:21:57.737]  Did you know that the United Nations has always chosen socialist one-worlders for its leadership?
[01:21:57.737 --> 01:22:03.841]  Did you know that the United Nations seeks power to control the environment, population, children, and the whole world?
[01:22:04.581 --> 01:22:08.025]  They want to dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:22:08.025 --> 01:22:19.977]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:27.503 --> 01:22:27.903]  Call now.
[01:22:27.903 --> 01:22:30.085]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:22:48.893 --> 01:22:56.758]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:56.758 --> 01:23:05.803]  So the feds cynically turned the military and the militarization of the police and the federalization loose on us completely in the 80s.
[01:23:05.803 --> 01:23:13.087]  We've confirmed that by the mid 80s they started covertly having Marine Corps, regular Marine Corps, regular Army dress up in
[01:23:14.620 --> 01:23:27.552]  Blue and black uniforms that just said police without badges or numbers to conduct gun raids, drug raids in Virginia, California, New York, Texas.
[01:23:27.552 --> 01:23:40.724]  From that point on, by the early 1990s they start giving helicopters, armored vehicles, in some cases treaded armored vehicles or LAVs, light armored vehicles to police.
[01:23:41.593 --> 01:23:46.016]  They set up multi-jurisdictional task forces and start federalizing them.
[01:23:46.016 --> 01:23:51.399]  By the late 1990s, they were running Delta Force ops in major cities coast to coast.
[01:23:51.399 --> 01:23:57.763]  And we later got documents, exactly as it was easy to see what they were doing, to condition the public for military takeover.
[01:23:57.763 --> 01:24:03.646]  Thomas Sanchez, Vietnam vet, head of emergency management in Kingsville, goes public about how they briefed him.
[01:24:03.646 --> 01:24:07.208]  This was for martial law takeover drills.
[01:24:07.208 --> 01:24:08.549]  That was in WorldNet Daily, by the way.
[01:24:09.204 --> 01:24:12.325]  They told him, oh yes, this is the train number one for martial law.
[01:24:12.325 --> 01:24:17.047]  Oh, I happen to get concerned at that point and start yelling and screaming.
[01:24:17.047 --> 01:24:22.489]  But by the last two years of Clinton, I said, I don't think Clinton's gonna do it.
[01:24:22.489 --> 01:24:24.230]  He doesn't have the muscle.
[01:24:24.230 --> 01:24:26.851]  But the way they're building, I said, in the next ten years they are.
[01:24:26.851 --> 01:24:28.872]  Well, we're here, folks.
[01:24:28.872 --> 01:24:30.592]  You know, I was saying that back in 98-99.
[01:24:30.592 --> 01:24:35.874]  And here we are, seven, eight years later.
[01:24:35.874 --> 01:24:37.195]  And they've, it's just,
[01:24:38.425 --> 01:24:39.726]  They don't quite have it yet.
[01:24:39.726 --> 01:24:46.791]  Another year or two, folks, they are built up enough, in my assessment, to hit us and hit us hard.
[01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:53.376]  They've got enough people brainwashed and the rest of it, but I think it's starting to backfire on them, and we'll get into that in a minute, then go to your calls.
[01:24:53.376 --> 01:24:54.757]  And there's hundreds of things that happen.
[01:24:55.939 --> 01:25:07.301]  The Feds, of course, in 93 cooked the bomb, trained the driver, gave them the detonators, carried out the attack on the World Trade Center, but the people they trained didn't park it up against the column, didn't bring down or even damage the structure.
[01:25:07.301 --> 01:25:09.402]  They wanted to have an excuse to try to tear it down.
[01:25:09.402 --> 01:25:11.662]  That didn't work.
[01:25:11.662 --> 01:25:19.504]  So obviously 9-11 takes place, Oklahoma City takes place, they get the omnibus crime bill, which continued to federalize, tripled anti-terror funding,
[01:25:20.226 --> 01:25:23.227]  Uh, set up all these new anti-terror squads around the country.
[01:25:23.227 --> 01:25:26.029]  Set up new computer databases to integrate everything.
[01:25:26.029 --> 01:25:33.892]  Of course, on the police state timeline, there's the 68 Gun Control Act, which federalizes gun ownership when it should have been a state issue.
[01:25:33.892 --> 01:25:35.673]  Start setting up the databases.
[01:25:35.673 --> 01:25:37.914]  It's truly gun registration that you're a gun owner.
[01:25:41.130 --> 01:25:43.072]  Then the people thought they defeated the Brady Bill.
[01:25:43.072 --> 01:25:43.593]  They really didn't.
[01:25:43.593 --> 01:25:46.596]  You got the instant check which started total federal control.
[01:25:46.596 --> 01:25:51.882]  Now they've expanded that two months ago to total federal integration.
[01:25:51.882 --> 01:25:54.825]  No one even seems to know about that because the NRA was for it.
[01:25:54.825 --> 01:25:57.468]  Another Judas Iscariot action.
[01:25:57.468 --> 01:25:58.028]  Let's talk about 9-11.
[01:25:58.028 --> 01:25:58.369]  October 27th, HR 3-1
[01:26:03.161 --> 01:26:04.622]  6-2 gets passed.
[01:26:04.622 --> 01:26:14.626]  The USA Patriot Act allows a secret break into your house without you knowing it, and without being able to tell anyone if you do discover the FBI or other federal agencies have been there.
[01:26:14.626 --> 01:26:17.247]  No warrant is needed.
[01:26:17.247 --> 01:26:23.630]  These are roving searches under Section... ah, the sections, I don't have it in front of me.
[01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:27.212]  Watson, just go read my analysis of Patriot Act 1 and 2.
[01:26:27.212 --> 01:26:28.632]  There's two analysis out there.
[01:26:28.632 --> 01:26:30.153]  It's got all the subsections.
[01:26:31.305 --> 01:26:34.050]  Uh, there's no sunset clause in all the key provisions.
[01:26:34.050 --> 01:26:41.203]  Then they built in a fake sunset as a way to really expand it while having a debate about reducing it.
[01:26:41.203 --> 01:26:42.906]  But the key provisions were not sunsetted.
[01:26:44.153 --> 01:26:48.277]  That allows illegally, of course, them to go into bookstores.
[01:26:48.277 --> 01:26:55.104]  There was a famous case where Borders was having to upload all their information to them every day, and then finally said no.
[01:26:55.104 --> 01:26:56.505]  So it came out in the news.
[01:26:56.505 --> 01:27:04.653]  They tell you you're not allowed to tell anybody you're being investigated, or they can order you to help be a spy and investigate others.
[01:27:04.653 --> 01:27:05.895]  Indentured servitude.
[01:27:05.895 --> 01:27:07.016]  Literally a spy slave.
[01:27:09.182 --> 01:27:10.343]  That's in Patriot Act 1.
[01:27:10.343 --> 01:27:15.467]  If you tell anybody that they're ordering you to snitch for them, you can go to prison.
[01:27:15.467 --> 01:27:18.028]  But again, people refused.
[01:27:18.028 --> 01:27:20.330]  It also says infrastructure protection.
[01:27:20.330 --> 01:27:22.031]  That's why Puffer Belly Toys in St.
[01:27:22.031 --> 01:27:22.672]  Helen, Oregon
[01:27:23.678 --> 01:27:24.479]  What is it?
[01:27:24.479 --> 01:27:34.565]  1,500 square feet, tiny business, had off-the-shelf, you know, chain-bought Magic Cubes, which were legal, lawful knockoffs of the patent that was up on Rubik's Cubes.
[01:27:34.565 --> 01:27:38.228]  Two Homeland Security officers show up and say, we're going to arrest you.
[01:27:38.228 --> 01:27:38.888]  And she says, why?
[01:27:38.888 --> 01:27:41.530]  And they said, those are illegal Rubik's Cubes.
[01:27:41.530 --> 01:27:44.352]  And they said, well, we won't arrest you, but tell anybody we were here, we'll arrest you.
[01:27:44.352 --> 01:27:46.413]  And it was all just a test, setting precedent.
[01:27:46.413 --> 01:27:48.094]  She did go to the Oregonian and the AP.
[01:27:48.094 --> 01:27:49.235]  It did report that.
[01:27:49.235 --> 01:27:53.418]  And when they called the FBI, they said, yeah, any infrastructure violation, anything,
[01:27:54.136 --> 01:28:16.239]  uh... is punishable by secret arrest and incarceration uh... because uh... it's infrastructure protection see now you're hearing that term more and more see all crime hurts the infrastructure and hurts the war effort as the uh... deputy attorney general california said member four years ago he said no protest allowed who are fighting al-qaeda and protesting the war aids al-qaeda alright so
[01:28:17.226 --> 01:28:21.568]  We have all of those different provisions being used in the Patriot Act.
[01:28:21.568 --> 01:28:26.949]  When we come back, I'll just run through the latest big developments that I promise go to your calls.
[01:28:26.949 --> 01:28:32.591]  And I want to hear from you callers about other points I've neglected to get to.
[01:28:32.591 --> 01:28:33.012]  Stay with us.
[01:28:33.012 --> 01:28:38.874]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:38.874 --> 01:28:40.254]  We're on the march.
[01:28:40.254 --> 01:28:42.795]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:42.795 --> 01:28:45.476]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:55.147]  How would you like to have a tool to use at home that you can use anytime that helps reduce back pain, sciatica, hip pain, and more?
[01:28:55.147 --> 01:28:58.151]  A tool that helps relieve the pain and doesn't just treat the symptoms.
[01:28:58.151 --> 01:29:00.714]  You need the SacroEggie Sacral Stabilizer.
[01:29:00.714 --> 01:29:04.238]  One satisfied user states, I don't believe in gadgets, but this is a miracle!
[01:29:04.438 --> 01:29:05.299]  Yes, that's right.
[01:29:05.299 --> 01:29:10.503]  Just relax 20 minutes daily or when needed to help correct the muscle imbalance that creates many of these symptoms.
[01:29:10.503 --> 01:29:14.366]  Gravity does the work with the Sacro Wedgie under the sacrum and support under your neck.
[01:29:14.366 --> 01:29:16.668]  Help correct posture to help relieve the pain.
[01:29:16.668 --> 01:29:18.649]  Better balance equals fewer problems.
[01:29:18.649 --> 01:29:21.852]  You can even sit on the Sacro Wedgie at the computer or while traveling.
[01:29:21.852 --> 01:29:27.436]  This device has been helping people for the past 15 years, yet the cost is still just $29.95.
[01:29:27.436 --> 01:29:30.679]  Finally, something available that really relieves those stubborn aches and pains.
[01:29:30.679 --> 01:29:30.959]  Call 1-800-737-8255.
[01:29:32.740 --> 01:29:33.562]  We're good to go.

[01:30:48.658 --> 01:30:53.021]  I don't mind that I'm getting older, but my wrinkles made me too nervous to smile.
[01:30:53.021 --> 01:30:58.404]  It was those fine lines that formed around my cheeks and mouth, and those crow's feet over by my eyes.
[01:30:58.404 --> 01:31:03.387]  People were starting to think I looked unhappy, but really I was just embarrassed by those wrinkles.
[01:31:03.387 --> 01:31:05.649]  Then I heard about a product called Totinol.
[01:31:05.649 --> 01:31:11.852]  Totinol is a serum that goes directly on the skin to support collagen and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[01:31:11.852 --> 01:31:12.653]  And it works.
[01:31:13.093 --> 01:31:14.914]  I'm not afraid to smile anymore.
[01:31:14.914 --> 01:31:16.195]  Now it's your turn.
[01:31:16.195 --> 01:31:18.717]  Today you can get a full bottle of Tautenol.
[01:31:18.717 --> 01:31:23.260]  You don't need a prescription and you don't need surgery to reduce the appearance of those wrinkles.
[01:31:23.260 --> 01:31:26.742]  See what Tautenol can do for you and your confidence.
[01:31:26.742 --> 01:31:29.144]  It sure gave me something to smile about.
[01:31:29.144 --> 01:31:31.545]  For your risk-free bottle of Tautenol, call 1-800-894-5152.
[01:31:31.545 --> 01:31:31.845]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[01:31:31.845 --> 01:31:33.666]  Tautenol is the non-invasive way to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.
[01:31:41.271 --> 01:31:44.652]  It's guaranteed.
[01:31:44.652 --> 01:31:45.893]  Call 1-800-894-5152.
[01:31:45.893 --> 01:31:49.674]  That's 1-800-894-5152.
[01:31:49.674 --> 01:31:52.434]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:52.434 --> 01:31:58.936]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:58.936 --> 01:32:07.479]  I forgot also, in late October and November, the anthrax attacks, for the first time in US history,
[01:32:10.171 --> 01:32:10.891]  Well, that's not true.
[01:32:10.891 --> 01:32:13.653]  Lincoln did a little bit of it.
[01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:20.658]  The President takes federal control over the Congress Capitol buildings because of the attack that they had clearly launched.
[01:32:20.658 --> 01:32:23.499]  Turned out to be the most ultra-weaponized U.S.
[01:32:23.499 --> 01:32:27.922]  slash British train ever seen.
[01:32:27.922 --> 01:32:32.725]  The microparticle genetically engineered anthrax.
[01:32:32.725 --> 01:32:34.506]  Super weaponized, so they used that.
[01:32:34.506 --> 01:32:37.488]  Now they have the Fed's force evacuation of the Capitol.
[01:32:39.125 --> 01:32:39.405]  I think?
[01:33:00.282 --> 01:33:02.784]  Patriot Act II, all of what he wants.
[01:33:02.784 --> 01:33:04.806]  He gets a few new horrible provisions.
[01:33:04.806 --> 01:33:13.052]  He's unable to get the Complete Victory Act, but as I predicted, they did trick people with the Patriot Act reauthorization.
[01:33:13.052 --> 01:33:24.942]  Now, all the big police state provisions were not grandfathered, were not sunsetted, but I've learned that trick they do by sunsetting things, because then that brings it back to a vote, and they get to say, oh, it's been five years since the Al-Qaeda hit us.
[01:33:27.356 --> 01:33:37.399]  And we need to be able to reauthorize this because Al Qaeda isn't going away just after this expires.
[01:33:37.399 --> 01:33:40.379]  Now again, all the real provisions were not going away.
[01:33:40.379 --> 01:33:42.600]  It was a way to expand it.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:47.761]  You've got a public that doesn't know up from down, or the basics, or even the three branches of government.
[01:33:47.761 --> 01:33:48.341]  What are they going to know?
[01:33:48.341 --> 01:33:50.682]  They just hear, we need to expand this to make everybody safe.
[01:33:53.226 --> 01:33:55.948]  And so they did get a few new incredible provisions into that.
[01:33:55.948 --> 01:33:58.450]  You can pull all that out of the Patriot Act 2 analysis we did.
[01:33:58.450 --> 01:34:12.861]  And we'll be linking to on the... That we'll be linking to in the report we're putting out, the tyranny timeline from liberty to tyranny, from liberty to enslavement.
[01:34:12.861 --> 01:34:15.303]  Death of the Republic, whatever you want to call it, it's the same thing.
[01:34:17.549 --> 01:34:22.112]  And this whole time, Bush keeps announcing, you're not allowed to look at Enron papers.
[01:34:22.112 --> 01:34:37.101]  It doesn't matter if I'm hiring, making the Attorney General, an Enron lawyer Attorney General, and you can't see the full torture memos where we ordered torture, but you can read the filing that he made to Congress where Alberto Gonzales said that we can torture people to death.
[01:34:37.101 --> 01:34:38.982]  Just don't call it torture.
[01:34:38.982 --> 01:34:45.946]  That's a, and then the John Yoo thing, the John Yoo, his deputy saying, well, we can't just torture them to death, we can torture small children with pliers.
[01:34:46.883 --> 01:34:48.404]  We can rip their genitals off!
[01:34:48.404 --> 01:34:51.565]  I mean, it actually says that!
[01:34:51.565 --> 01:34:52.465]  Oh, how Christian!
[01:34:52.465 --> 01:34:53.306]  How American!
[01:34:53.306 --> 01:34:54.026]  Yes!
[01:34:54.026 --> 01:34:55.026]  Oh!
[01:34:55.026 --> 01:34:57.167]  And the President announced he was literally God.
[01:34:57.167 --> 01:34:59.728]  And in the memo said, all law flows from him.
[01:34:59.728 --> 01:35:01.549]  He is the law.
[01:35:01.549 --> 01:35:12.013]  And then, uh, in front of a bunch of reporters at a cocktail dinner, uh, what, about a year and a half ago, Roe, Karl Roe, tells, um,
[01:35:12.836 --> 01:35:16.437]  Karl Rove says to a bunch of reporters, he says, we make reality.
[01:35:16.437 --> 01:35:17.878]  We control reality.
[01:35:17.878 --> 01:35:18.338]  You don't.
[01:35:18.338 --> 01:35:19.378]  You just do whatever we say.
[01:35:19.378 --> 01:35:21.699]  We'll say something different tomorrow from what we said yesterday.
[01:35:21.699 --> 01:35:26.721]  I mean, it's literally a O'Brien speech right out of 1984.
[01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:27.962]  But this isn't a novel, folks.
[01:35:27.962 --> 01:35:28.802]  This is the real deal.
[01:35:32.827 --> 01:35:34.949]  And then the President starts making declaratory statements.
[01:35:34.949 --> 01:35:39.492]  Cheney says he's outside the government, but then he also declares executive privilege.
[01:35:39.492 --> 01:35:49.679]  Doesn't matter that Congress funds the President, and Congress, if you really read the Federalist and Anti-Federalist papers, Congress is supreme, because it's the most divided, has the most members from the states.
[01:35:49.679 --> 01:35:56.483]  It's hard to get a dictator in there, because they knew men's will for power meant they would fight against each other, so you wouldn't get a tyranny.
[01:35:56.483 --> 01:35:57.544]  The founders were geniuses.
[01:36:01.934 --> 01:36:10.721]  But they have circumvented and circumnavigated a lot of that now by committee chairmanships and payoffs and bribery and the national security apparatchik.
[01:36:10.721 --> 01:36:15.845]  As soon as they told Congress in 1947, well, you can't see classified data anymore.
[01:36:15.845 --> 01:36:19.448]  Anyone in Congress could see it at that point.
[01:36:19.448 --> 01:36:20.029]  It's a trick.
[01:36:20.029 --> 01:36:24.152]  It's just like they said, oh, you don't have to have a license, but it's only for trucks, you know, in 1920s.
[01:36:25.640 --> 01:36:28.181]  And then, oh, in the fifties, well, you don't have to, but it helps.
[01:36:28.181 --> 01:36:29.422]  Let's go ahead and get one.
[01:36:29.422 --> 01:36:32.183]  Oh, now it's a privilege to drive, to travel.
[01:36:32.183 --> 01:36:33.864]  You've got to have this.
[01:36:33.864 --> 01:36:42.287]  Or just like churches didn't have licenses and were outside the government, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:36:42.287 --> 01:36:43.828]  This is how you're domesticated.
[01:36:43.828 --> 01:36:47.209]  This is how they practice tyranny on you by inroads.
[01:36:47.209 --> 01:36:48.510]  But see, now it's all coming to a head.
[01:36:48.510 --> 01:36:48.830]  They say,
[01:36:51.636 --> 01:36:53.797]  Churches, you've got to have this to have a church.
[01:36:53.797 --> 01:36:55.418]  And you can't say anything political.
[01:36:55.418 --> 01:36:56.999]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:36:56.999 --> 01:36:59.541]  And you've got to be tax exempt.
[01:36:59.541 --> 01:37:01.722]  They just announced in the 50s, oh, you've got to do it.
[01:37:01.722 --> 01:37:02.683]  And it's just a formality.
[01:37:02.683 --> 01:37:03.923]  Just sign a form.
[01:37:03.923 --> 01:37:07.525]  And then now they send SWAT teams if you don't.
[01:37:07.525 --> 01:37:08.366]  There's no law.
[01:37:08.366 --> 01:37:09.747]  It's practice.
[01:37:09.747 --> 01:37:11.408]  The cops don't even know it's not a law.
[01:37:11.408 --> 01:37:13.329]  It's now law of jungle, folks.
[01:37:15.763 --> 01:37:17.404]  It's the same thing with Congress.
[01:37:17.404 --> 01:37:20.867]  They say, oh, in the 47, the Russians are spying on us.
[01:37:20.867 --> 01:37:23.449]  It's a formality.
[01:37:23.449 --> 01:37:33.456]  Just come into this bubble areas, but sweep for bugs and checked, and the CIA is here to help, and the Army Intelligence is here to run things, and by the way, that's who runs it.
[01:37:33.456 --> 01:37:36.638]  We're here, the military, to keep control.
[01:37:36.638 --> 01:37:39.160]  A few years later, we're sorry.
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:41.021]  Not all members of Congress are allowed to see it.
[01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:41.922]  About half of you aren't.
[01:37:43.135 --> 01:37:49.741]  But the other half, if you're on any committee of any power, and then, oh, the Intelligence Committee can see it.
[01:37:49.741 --> 01:37:53.284]  And then, oh, sorry, none of you can.
[01:37:53.284 --> 01:37:56.367]  That was just announced last month.
[01:37:56.367 --> 01:37:59.469]  Oh, Congress, you can see nothing.
[01:37:59.469 --> 01:38:03.333]  I mean, folks, that is total, that's it, that's it.
[01:38:03.333 --> 01:38:05.234]  I mean, you want it, folks, you got it.
[01:38:05.234 --> 01:38:06.856]  That is martial law.
[01:38:07.694 --> 01:38:09.675]  Okay, that is Dictator.
[01:38:09.675 --> 01:38:10.655]  That is Caesar.
[01:38:10.655 --> 01:38:11.855]  That is Hitler.
[01:38:11.855 --> 01:38:12.756]  That is Rao.
[01:38:12.756 --> 01:38:15.277]  That is Palpatine.
[01:38:15.277 --> 01:38:18.758]  Okay, that is the real McCoy.
[01:38:18.758 --> 01:38:23.179]  You are seeing the real animal.
[01:38:23.179 --> 01:38:24.700]  You wanted to see it?
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:26.460]  We all got front row seats.
[01:38:26.460 --> 01:38:28.621]  I'll tell you this, I'm certainly not bored these days.
[01:38:28.621 --> 01:38:29.661]  Life is quite excitement.
[01:38:29.661 --> 01:38:32.342]  For the moment, my dreams are about this now.
[01:38:32.342 --> 01:38:33.903]  My life is pure excitement.
[01:38:33.903 --> 01:38:34.743]  Oh, it's exciting!
[01:38:36.246 --> 01:38:39.708]  It's because this isn't just some elite that wants to suck off the treasury.
[01:38:39.708 --> 01:38:45.350]  These are a bunch of eugenicists, and they got real fun stuff planned for your family.
[01:38:45.350 --> 01:38:49.992]  And they got a bunch of dumb cops who'll do whatever they're told, folks.
[01:38:49.992 --> 01:38:55.234]  If the Nazis would do it, I guarantee you the average cop will line children up and blow their heads clean off.
[01:38:55.234 --> 01:38:56.695]  And don't think they won't do it.
[01:38:56.695 --> 01:38:58.796]  And by the way, you think I'm joking when I say that.
[01:38:59.986 --> 01:39:02.767]  The average citizen would do that if ordered.
[01:39:02.767 --> 01:39:04.307]  We have turned into scum.
[01:39:04.307 --> 01:39:08.268]  I'm not just picking on the police.
[01:39:08.268 --> 01:39:11.529]  And cops better start gut-checking right now.
[01:39:11.529 --> 01:39:16.650]  Because the road to hell, folks, dips really fast, and we just went over the edge.
[01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:22.251]  And that tickle in your belly, you feel, is the drop.
[01:39:22.251 --> 01:39:22.831]  Alright, so...
[01:39:24.967 --> 01:39:26.808]  Last year, it all accelerates.
[01:39:26.808 --> 01:39:33.413]  John Warner Defense Authorization Act, word for word, and I want it in the article, Paul, pull it up, pull up the bill.
[01:39:33.413 --> 01:39:48.783]  The full defense funding for 2007 says for any insurrection, any emergency, any crisis the President deems, for any reason, rebellion, resistance, he uses those terms, that there are tens of billions of dollars for domestic martial law.
[01:39:48.783 --> 01:39:49.183]  It says it.
[01:39:50.937 --> 01:39:52.798]  Says it in clear black and white.
[01:39:52.798 --> 01:40:00.661]  Defense funding domestically, and NORTHCOM was fully funded domestically, not just off black op funds.
[01:40:00.661 --> 01:40:05.722]  And not just off missile interception funds.
[01:40:05.722 --> 01:40:09.944]  And they took full control.
[01:40:09.944 --> 01:40:14.726]  Now, over North America, by the way, Canada and Mexico went under, at that time, under agreements.
[01:40:14.726 --> 01:40:17.287]  North American Union was formed, fully kicked off.
[01:40:17.287 --> 01:40:18.307]  It all integrates together.
[01:40:19.554 --> 01:40:27.716]  And as if that wasn't enough, they gave us the Military Commissions Act, which all of the top lawyers on both political parties looked at and they said, yeah, yeah, no, this says U.S.
[01:40:27.716 --> 01:40:33.958]  citizens can be secretly arrested, secretly stripped of citizenship, secretly tortured, secretly executed.
[01:40:33.958 --> 01:40:35.098]  Black and white, baby.
[01:40:35.098 --> 01:40:40.960]  We can use evidence obtained in torture in secret trials, and if the military officers won't convict you,
[01:40:42.103 --> 01:40:48.427]  Any designate of the Secretary of Defense, the President, or Vice President can order your execution or worse.
[01:40:48.427 --> 01:40:49.608]  I mean, that's the king.
[01:40:49.608 --> 01:40:51.689]  Seize that man and off with his head, baby.
[01:40:51.689 --> 01:40:53.671]  Boom.
[01:40:53.671 --> 01:40:55.512]  Say, funded martial law.
[01:40:55.512 --> 01:40:57.333]  Drop the hammer on that.
[01:40:57.333 --> 01:40:59.194]  Went to Ace of Spades.
[01:40:59.194 --> 01:41:02.577]  Pulled that sucker out and put it on the table.
[01:41:02.577 --> 01:41:03.777]  And did they stop there?
[01:41:03.777 --> 01:41:04.618]  No, they weren't done.
[01:41:07.245 --> 01:41:08.546]  They weren't done by a long shot.
[01:41:08.546 --> 01:41:15.934]  They started fully funding FEMA centers that they'd already built in the name of emergency management and threat integration centers and emergency integration centers.
[01:41:15.934 --> 01:41:17.495]  They started announcing they were federal.
[01:41:17.495 --> 01:41:20.418]  They started announcing, hey, we got over 10,000 spies.
[01:41:20.418 --> 01:41:23.221]  We want community people to come to meetings they'd already set up after 9-11.
[01:41:24.202 --> 01:41:25.923]  By the way, you're not going to be fighting terror now.
[01:41:25.923 --> 01:41:27.964]  You're going to be fighting crime.
[01:41:27.964 --> 01:41:31.026]  Here's your secret logins on FBI computers locally.
[01:41:31.026 --> 01:41:33.447]  We want you to write dossiers on all your neighbors.
[01:41:33.447 --> 01:41:36.609]  Then they announced, yeah, the feds are reading the papers your kids write.
[01:41:36.609 --> 01:41:43.132]  Yeah, we had announced it was a federal thing to check for plagiarism where your children's papers from the 6th grade on were uploaded to the government.
[01:41:43.132 --> 01:41:45.113]  Really, we got keyword stuff mining those.
[01:41:46.528 --> 01:41:59.473]  We're going to pay tens of billions of dollars to put in software for lip reading, face scanning, and license plate scanning, and all these high-def cameras and high-definition digital cameras they've put in the last five years.
[01:41:59.473 --> 01:42:02.214]  And yeah, we're going to use microphones and listen to you.
[01:42:02.214 --> 01:42:05.155]  And yeah, we're going to use Mexican and Canadian troops when we're doing this.
[01:42:05.155 --> 01:42:09.337]  And yeah, we're going to start banning protesting for 18 miles around meetings we have.
[01:42:12.566 --> 01:42:19.213]  And we don't care if you want toll roads, we're going to go ahead and sign on to the toll road phase 2, and then tell you we didn't do phase 2.
[01:42:19.213 --> 01:42:23.838]  And it'll even fool people in the anti-toll road movement.
[01:42:23.838 --> 01:42:28.223]  And we're going to go to pure propaganda now, where it just reaches la-la land levels.
[01:42:28.223 --> 01:42:33.569]  And then, they're going to come out and say, and then Bush illegally did warrantless spying on the American people,
[01:42:34.312 --> 01:42:40.920]  Then they come out and spin it and go, oh, we just passed a law giving him the power he needs, so it's been lawed and calls America.
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:45.305]  Folks, the thing says that without warrants, they can spout on the American people any way they want.
[01:42:45.305 --> 01:42:49.250]  And they just put these headlines out saying it doesn't, but Drudge got it right.
[01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:50.792]  It says up there, no more warrants!
[01:42:52.418 --> 01:42:54.359]  Meanwhile, the illegal aliens are above the law.
[01:42:54.359 --> 01:42:55.940]  That's a key point in all this.
[01:42:55.940 --> 01:43:05.685]  They don't get stopped or taken to jail in most cities for DWI, no inspection stickers, no driver's license, or their matricula, which you can literally get out of a Cracker Jack box.
[01:43:05.685 --> 01:43:06.986]  Literally.
[01:43:06.986 --> 01:43:11.408]  I mean, you can go in there and buy them yourself.
[01:43:11.408 --> 01:43:12.729]  At any consulate.
[01:43:12.729 --> 01:43:14.530]  And they're accepting them now from hundreds of countries.
[01:43:15.774 --> 01:43:17.595]  We're completely wide open.
[01:43:17.595 --> 01:43:19.055]  The borders are wide open.
[01:43:19.055 --> 01:43:21.396]  Drug-immune and resistant TB is spreading.
[01:43:21.396 --> 01:43:23.216]  Meningitis is spreading everywhere.
[01:43:23.216 --> 01:43:25.237]  People are dying all over the place.
[01:43:25.237 --> 01:43:27.038]  They're setting up huge sanitariums.
[01:43:27.038 --> 01:43:29.018]  It's a blurb in the news.
[01:43:29.018 --> 01:43:32.219]  While they run around fear-mongering that Al-Qaeda is going to get us.
[01:43:32.219 --> 01:43:38.341]  And then, in May, a month and a half ago, President Bush signs PDD 51.
[01:43:38.341 --> 01:43:42.943]  And it says, for any emergency, anywhere in the world, economic,
[01:43:43.915 --> 01:43:44.595]  Military.
[01:43:44.595 --> 01:43:45.936]  It doesn't matter.
[01:43:45.936 --> 01:43:47.756]  The President is above the Congress.
[01:43:47.756 --> 01:43:49.236]  Congress has no oversight.
[01:43:49.236 --> 01:43:52.577]  And the President can do whatever he wants.
[01:43:52.577 --> 01:43:54.158]  For any reason.
[01:43:54.158 --> 01:43:57.238]  And it says, I grant myself new powers.
[01:43:57.238 --> 01:44:01.839]  I mean, if that isn't Hitler, folks, if that isn't Julius Caesar, I don't know what is.
[01:44:01.839 --> 01:44:08.361]  I, Napoleon putting the crown on his own head, I make myself king.
[01:44:11.110 --> 01:44:13.313]  And the elite will probably not pull the trigger.
[01:44:13.313 --> 01:44:15.235]  They'll probably let a Hillary come in and then do it.
[01:44:15.235 --> 01:44:18.219]  Because that's when everything's really lined up for this.
[01:44:18.219 --> 01:44:18.679]  But I don't know.
[01:44:18.679 --> 01:44:21.322]  They may just go for bloke now.
[01:44:21.322 --> 01:44:22.904]  Let me tell you what they're telling police departments.
[01:44:22.904 --> 01:44:25.327]  Let me tell you what they're telling the Congress and others.
[01:44:25.327 --> 01:44:28.631]  They tell the police departments we think we're about to be hit by massive terror attacks.
[01:44:28.631 --> 01:44:31.074]  The feds have staged a bunch of terror attacks that they tell the cops.
[01:44:31.749 --> 01:44:39.716]  You know, where the cops see guys running away in black uniforms and they tell them, oh no, tell everybody that the chemical plant wasn't blown up, it was an accident.
[01:44:39.716 --> 01:44:44.761]  And the cops are all whispering, we've been secretly deputized and we've been hit by Al-Qaeda.
[01:44:44.761 --> 01:44:47.964]  There's cops listening right now with their mouths hanging open going, how do you know that?
[01:44:47.964 --> 01:44:49.065]  Because it's come out.
[01:44:49.065 --> 01:44:55.691]  That's how the feds play you, like a fiddle.
[01:44:55.691 --> 01:44:58.253]  God, I'm probably selling my life just to warn all you people this.
[01:44:59.326 --> 01:45:00.888]  Just giving it to you, you fools.
[01:45:00.888 --> 01:45:01.989]  I hope you're listening to me.
[01:45:01.989 --> 01:45:04.391]  I really hope you listen to me.
[01:45:04.391 --> 01:45:08.815]  So they tell the locals we're getting hit by terrorists every month, but to keep it quiet, the public will panic.
[01:45:08.815 --> 01:45:10.977]  That's how they get you into the lying and the secrecy.
[01:45:10.977 --> 01:45:12.238]  This has all been figured out.
[01:45:13.627 --> 01:45:17.009]  And then they, at the federal level, we're about to have a massive depression.
[01:45:17.009 --> 01:45:20.751]  I've been telling them for ten years with the debt, that's why we're gearing all this up.
[01:45:20.751 --> 01:45:22.592]  They're like, alright, I guess.
[01:45:22.592 --> 01:45:26.034]  And we don't worry, we've got contingencies to keep you safe, everything breaks down.
[01:45:26.034 --> 01:45:27.434]  Alright, thank you.
[01:45:27.434 --> 01:45:31.437]  Now just go ahead and fund, you won't be part of the government anymore.
[01:45:31.437 --> 01:45:37.880]  Alright, I'll put the noose around my own neck, as long as I'm included.
[01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:39.621]  Will there still be hookers in the bunker?
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.822]  And here we stand on the precipice.
[01:45:44.822 --> 01:45:45.682]  Will you rally?
[01:45:45.682 --> 01:45:46.563]  Will you speak out?
[01:45:46.563 --> 01:45:48.364]  Will you make martial law the biggest issue?
[01:45:48.364 --> 01:45:50.566]  We need articles every day out of Jones Report.
[01:45:50.566 --> 01:45:54.209]  PrisonPlanet, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[01:45:54.209 --> 01:45:59.052]  I need you, the listeners, the lawyers, the experts, the constitutional scholars, to write articles for us and post it.
[01:45:59.052 --> 01:46:01.935]  I mean, if you've got a website bigger than ours, post it on yours, we'll link to you.
[01:46:01.935 --> 01:46:02.695]  I don't care.
[01:46:02.695 --> 01:46:06.998]  But finally I'm seeing big Democrat websites, big conservative sites talk about this.
[01:46:06.998 --> 01:46:10.121]  Finally the libertarians that are always shucking their thumbs and
[01:46:10.681 --> 01:46:14.544]  Saying there's no secret government, or talking about secret governments and martial law.
[01:46:14.544 --> 01:46:16.645]  Finally, all the thumb suckers are waking up.
[01:46:16.645 --> 01:46:17.666]  And that's good.
[01:46:17.666 --> 01:46:20.388]  You better wake up, thumb suckers.
[01:46:20.388 --> 01:46:25.332]  Because I'm here to tell you, this is the real deal.
[01:46:25.332 --> 01:46:32.497]  When the President says the Congress isn't involved in continuity of government for any emergency, I run everything.
[01:46:34.620 --> 01:46:43.567]  And when they got federal troops in there every week, shoving congressmen around, if there's some kind of drill, they'll run up outside and scream and shove a congressman and say, get off camera.
[01:46:43.567 --> 01:46:46.709]  It's all about that exercise of power.
[01:46:46.709 --> 01:46:50.872]  And you stupid little goons that like enforcing it, you have no idea.
[01:46:50.872 --> 01:46:52.553]  They shoot you up full of that mercury.
[01:46:52.553 --> 01:46:54.655]  They put aspartame in your baby's food.
[01:46:56.388 --> 01:46:57.969]  You don't know who your friends are.
[01:46:57.969 --> 01:47:05.652]  See, I don't talk to you with that smiley, fake, rubby on the back, tell you I'm your friend baloney.
[01:47:05.652 --> 01:47:08.053]  I look at you right in the eyes and say you've been fooled.
[01:47:08.053 --> 01:47:09.193]  Just like everybody else.
[01:47:09.193 --> 01:47:11.794]  Me included.
[01:47:11.794 --> 01:47:13.315]  This is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:47:13.315 --> 01:47:15.296]  This is the real deal.
[01:47:15.296 --> 01:47:15.616]  Okay?
[01:47:16.468 --> 01:47:17.449]  What are we going to do?
[01:47:17.449 --> 01:47:19.111]  Are we going to stand against this?
[01:47:19.111 --> 01:47:19.991]  Are we going to say no?
[01:47:19.991 --> 01:47:23.294]  And the same martial law is being put in place in England.
[01:47:23.294 --> 01:47:24.536]  The same thing in Europe.
[01:47:24.536 --> 01:47:25.837]  China's putting it in place.
[01:47:25.837 --> 01:47:33.864]  I mean, they're gearing up planetary-wide for oppression of the people.
[01:47:33.864 --> 01:47:36.026]  And seizing all of our infrastructures.
[01:47:36.026 --> 01:47:38.869]  And I mean, getting rid of our borders.
[01:47:38.869 --> 01:47:40.050]  I mean, this is only the beginning.
[01:47:45.098 --> 01:47:53.601]  And one of the biggest forms of tyranny is that the illegal aliens get better loans, better housing loans, better everything, and get special treatment that citizens don't get.
[01:47:53.601 --> 01:47:58.543]  They are a special, protected class.
[01:47:58.543 --> 01:48:05.966]  Last week, the Republicans passed a law that the government would no longer give housing loans and preferential treatment to illegal aliens.
[01:48:06.841 --> 01:48:10.243]  And the Democrats just shut, just on Friday, just said no.
[01:48:10.243 --> 01:48:12.924]  Well, excuse me, Thursday, just said no.
[01:48:12.924 --> 01:48:15.446]  No, you're not, the vote is nulled.
[01:48:15.446 --> 01:48:17.387]  They tried to vote again, they just shut the computers off.
[01:48:17.387 --> 01:48:18.928]  It said, malfunction!
[01:48:18.928 --> 01:48:21.349]  And it didn't pass, folks!
[01:48:21.349 --> 01:48:23.931]  Then they tried to pass it again, they just shut the computers off again.
[01:48:23.931 --> 01:48:27.253]  And then said, now you go ahead and pass warrantless wiretapping.
[01:48:27.253 --> 01:48:28.653]  Well, that's the final thing.
[01:48:28.653 --> 01:48:32.716]  Then Saturday, the House passes, the Senate already passed it, Bush signed it at Camp David.
[01:48:32.716 --> 01:48:33.256]  Hours later,
[01:48:34.406 --> 01:48:39.367]  Retroactive that no more warrants, no more nothing.
[01:48:39.367 --> 01:48:43.328]  Let's go to Jeff in Michigan who disagrees, and Mario and others.
[01:48:43.328 --> 01:48:44.409]  Thanks for holding, Jeff.
[01:48:44.409 --> 01:48:45.689]  You disagree, you're at the head of the line.
[01:48:45.689 --> 01:48:46.849]  Go ahead.
[01:48:46.849 --> 01:48:57.672]  What the disagreement is, is I was kind of had the feeling you might have taken, this is old news in a way, Rothschild a bit out of context.
[01:48:57.672 --> 01:48:58.973]  Oh, God.
[01:48:58.973 --> 01:49:03.554]  Well, here's the thing is, it's hard for me to think he would think
[01:49:04.540 --> 01:49:10.364]  The public is that stupid to think that Mars is closer than Earth.
[01:49:10.364 --> 01:49:11.144]  Well, you know what?
[01:49:11.144 --> 01:49:14.426]  I'm going to stop you right there, because you're saying stuff that isn't true.
[01:49:14.426 --> 01:49:14.886]  Okay?
[01:49:14.886 --> 01:49:18.989]  I mean, you do, and it's the sickness of the mind where you can't see what's clear.
[01:49:18.989 --> 01:49:19.569]  Okay?
[01:49:19.569 --> 01:49:21.710]  And where you lawyer around.
[01:49:21.710 --> 01:49:26.073]  Rothschild, three times I approached him and said, you're saying these planets are closer.
[01:49:26.073 --> 01:49:28.294]  And he would just laugh, showing his arrogance.
[01:49:28.294 --> 01:49:31.136]  And he did say, he said that they are closer.
[01:49:31.136 --> 01:49:34.098]  That Mars and Jupiter and Saturn are closer to the Sun.
[01:49:35.708 --> 01:49:39.656]  Now, and he also said that there wasn't a global tax they're pushing.
[01:49:39.656 --> 01:49:41.901]  Stay there, fine.
[01:49:41.901 --> 01:49:43.705]  I'm taking stuff out of context.
[01:49:43.705 --> 01:49:45.228]  You're gonna find out real fast.
[01:49:52.205 --> 01:49:55.708]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[01:49:55.708 --> 01:49:58.030]  My new film, Terror Storm, is complete.
[01:49:58.030 --> 01:50:06.377]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that Western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[01:50:06.377 --> 01:50:13.383]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[01:50:13.803 --> 01:50:25.526]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[01:50:25.526 --> 01:50:29.487]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[01:50:29.487 --> 01:50:31.767]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[01:50:31.767 --> 01:50:35.588]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[01:50:49.895 --> 01:50:59.219]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:50:59.219 --> 01:51:10.763]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:10.763 --> 01:51:15.825]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are
[01:51:15.845 --> 01:51:15.985]  I think?
[01:51:34.855 --> 01:51:36.516]  Get a 2-pack, only $99, or a 4-pack, only $188.
[01:51:36.516 --> 01:51:37.397]  Call New Millennium, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:37.397 --> 01:51:39.158]  That's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:49.469 --> 01:51:50.109]  Morning, neighbor!
[01:51:50.109 --> 01:51:52.570]  Hey, shouldn't you be at work?
[01:51:52.570 --> 01:51:53.150]  I am.
[01:51:53.150 --> 01:51:55.351]  As a matter of fact, I pulled another all-nighter.
[01:51:55.351 --> 01:51:56.071]  What do you mean?
[01:51:56.071 --> 01:51:59.353]  Well, I'm working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
[01:51:59.353 --> 01:52:01.633]  Well, at least I'm making money 24-7.
[01:52:01.633 --> 01:52:03.074]  But I never have to go to work.
[01:52:03.074 --> 01:52:04.294]  So, what do you do?
[01:52:04.294 --> 01:52:05.695]  Not very much at all now.
[01:52:05.695 --> 01:52:07.516]  About a month ago, I heard about this website.
[01:52:07.516 --> 01:52:08.456]  It's got a funny name.
[01:52:08.456 --> 01:52:11.177]  It's DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:52:11.517 --> 01:52:12.737]  That is funny.
[01:52:12.737 --> 01:52:17.939]  Yeah, you can earn $1,200 to $12,000 a week starting the very first week.
[01:52:17.939 --> 01:52:20.180]  Oh, is that how you bought that new mower?
[01:52:20.180 --> 01:52:23.101]  Yeah, and the motorcycle I've always wanted, too.
[01:52:23.101 --> 01:52:23.901]  You should log on.
[01:52:23.901 --> 01:52:25.982]  Find out how you can become financially free.
[01:52:25.982 --> 01:52:27.502]  So, what was that website?
[01:52:27.502 --> 01:52:34.864]  It's www.DidYouRobBillGates.com Just wait, I'll go get a pen so I can write that down.
[01:52:34.864 --> 01:52:35.965]  You don't need to write it down.
[01:52:35.965 --> 01:52:37.085]  It's easy to remember.
[01:52:37.085 --> 01:52:39.786]  DidYouRobBillGates.com
[01:52:40.046 --> 01:52:40.787]  Yeah!
[01:52:40.787 --> 01:52:43.729]  DidYouRobBillGates.com.
[01:52:43.729 --> 01:52:44.749]  That is easy!
[01:52:44.749 --> 01:52:54.216]  It's easy, and the money is awesome!
[01:52:54.216 --> 01:52:55.377]  Lookin' out your window.
[01:52:55.377 --> 01:52:56.998]  Oh, there's a scene you like to catch.
[01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:04.244]  Here's the analogy for all the Star Wars nerds out there.
[01:53:25.419 --> 01:53:31.282]  The Death Star is orbiting the planet and is about to be cleared to fire on the moon on the far side.
[01:53:31.282 --> 01:53:33.823]  Okay, that's how bad the tyranny is.
[01:53:33.823 --> 01:53:36.664]  And I mean, they're intending to go for full broke.
[01:53:36.664 --> 01:53:39.566]  The President has announced he's above Congress.
[01:53:39.566 --> 01:53:43.067]  I mean, literally rules them, and the country, and is the law.
[01:53:43.067 --> 01:53:45.789]  He's funded martial law.
[01:53:45.789 --> 01:53:49.090]  They're setting up domestic spies everywhere.
[01:53:49.090 --> 01:53:50.631]  They're talking about attacking Iran.
[01:53:51.636 --> 01:53:54.060]  They're not playing games.
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:53:59.388]  They're saying they can spy on you without warrants.
[01:53:59.388 --> 01:54:00.870]  And again, it's not Bush.
[01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:01.851]  He's a puppet.
[01:54:01.851 --> 01:54:03.534]  This is the elite making their move.
[01:54:03.534 --> 01:54:06.959]  It's seamless between Bill Clinton and the Bushes and Hillary.
[01:54:07.896 --> 01:54:08.897]  Jeff, go ahead.
[01:54:08.897 --> 01:54:10.557]  Okay, I took Rothschild out of context.
[01:54:10.557 --> 01:54:11.618]  I'm bad, okay?
[01:54:11.618 --> 01:54:11.978]  Fine.
[01:54:11.978 --> 01:54:20.222]  The planets are closer, and I'm lying, and global warming's real, and let's just, uh, man-made, and let's just pay a global tax, uh, to fix it, okay?
[01:54:20.222 --> 01:54:20.742]  No, no, no.
[01:54:20.742 --> 01:54:21.542]  Here's the thing.
[01:54:21.542 --> 01:54:25.124]  I believe, I myself, I believe it's due to sunspots.
[01:54:25.124 --> 01:54:28.645]  I don't think it's a man-made problem that... Well, there's no think about it.
[01:54:28.645 --> 01:54:29.746]  We know it's the sun.
[01:54:29.746 --> 01:54:30.246]  Right.
[01:54:30.246 --> 01:54:36.529]  Um, what I was wondering, though, and I might be giving him too much credit, if he was trying to play you
[01:54:37.566 --> 01:54:46.769]  And I was just curious, could, and I don't know if this is even feasible, but could Mars at all, like the orbital distance, vary in any way?
[01:54:46.769 --> 01:54:47.669]  Oh, it does.
[01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:51.910]  It does vary, and I appreciate your call, and I've already said this.
[01:54:51.910 --> 01:55:06.194]  Even if he, and we engage in mental gymnastics, even if he meant to say, well, the orbits are closer than they normally are, all the planets are closer in, or a few of them are closer in than their normal orbits, not that Mars was further out,
[01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:17.505]  Or in a different order than it normally is, but that it was closer into the sun.
[01:55:17.505 --> 01:55:18.985]  Okay, number one, you can look that up.
[01:55:18.985 --> 01:55:27.870]  Number two, even if that's the case, it would show that the sun, which it isn't by the way, I looked it up, it would show that the sun is heating up.
[01:55:27.870 --> 01:55:29.690]  And that's why it's melting.
[01:55:29.690 --> 01:55:32.912]  It still proves that it's the sun doing it, which proves my point.
[01:55:34.179 --> 01:55:34.719]  Okay.
[01:55:34.719 --> 01:55:37.720]  I mean, let's say Jupiter and Saturn and Mars were closer to the Sun than the Earth.
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:38.901]  They're not.
[01:55:38.901 --> 01:55:40.721]  But let's say they were.
[01:55:40.721 --> 01:55:44.582]  Still, that would mean that it was the Sun.
[01:55:44.582 --> 01:55:45.383]  And that's two ways.
[01:55:45.383 --> 01:55:49.224]  The planet can be closer to the Sun, or the Sun can be brighter.
[01:55:49.224 --> 01:55:51.125]  It's generally because the Sun is brighter.
[01:55:51.125 --> 01:55:53.125]  I don't know how to explain this to people.
[01:55:53.125 --> 01:55:53.826]  God help us.
[01:55:53.826 --> 01:55:54.486]  God help us.
[01:55:54.486 --> 01:55:55.066]  God help us.
[01:55:55.066 --> 01:55:55.606]  God help us.
[01:55:55.606 --> 01:55:57.887]  God help us.
[01:55:57.887 --> 01:56:00.568]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mario in New York who disagrees next.
[01:56:00.568 --> 01:56:01.188]  Go ahead, Mario.
[01:56:03.325 --> 01:56:03.906]  Hello?
[01:56:03.906 --> 01:56:06.009]  Yes, go ahead, Mario.
[01:56:06.009 --> 01:56:16.282]  Anything, God help us, and I like this show, and you have all the evidence, and you have a whole bunch of activists and many prominent people
[01:56:17.043 --> 01:56:22.385]  How come you guys can't get an indictment or stop these tyrants?
[01:56:22.385 --> 01:56:25.686]  I always love the calls I get where I'm not doing enough.
[01:56:25.686 --> 01:56:29.828]  There have been hundreds of lawsuits filed and thrown out under national security.
[01:56:29.828 --> 01:56:37.230]  I mean, Dick Cheney doesn't even let families sue the Saudis, believing the official story that it was foreigners that did the attacks.
[01:56:37.230 --> 01:56:43.312]  Because James Baker, former Secretary of State, is their lawyer.
[01:56:43.312 --> 01:56:44.953]  There have been people filing suits.
[01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:47.061]  The court system is rotten.
[01:56:47.061 --> 01:56:53.443]  Are you going to overthrow or get past the court system?
[01:56:53.443 --> 01:56:55.844]  And then people say, well then why are you fighting?
[01:56:55.844 --> 01:56:59.246]  We don't have a choice, man!
[01:56:59.246 --> 01:57:01.687]  They're watching to see how much we resist.
[01:57:01.687 --> 01:57:03.268]  If we don't fight them, they're going to do it.
[01:57:03.268 --> 01:57:08.990]  And that means taking you and lining you up and blowing your brain all over the wall, Mario.
[01:57:08.990 --> 01:57:10.551]  They want to stick a cold muzzle.
[01:57:11.323 --> 01:57:15.767]  It'll be a hot muzzle because they'll be going on the line, and they want to hear you squeal and beg.
[01:57:15.767 --> 01:57:16.367]  They like that.
[01:57:16.367 --> 01:57:18.849]  And then they want to blow your head off, okay?
[01:57:18.849 --> 01:57:22.613]  And then they take a deep breath in and go, oh yeah.
[01:57:22.613 --> 01:57:23.093]  That's what they do.
[01:57:23.093 --> 01:57:28.618]  They go, oh yeah.

[01:58:53.189 --> 01:58:54.509]  Big Brother.
[01:58:54.509 --> 01:58:56.270]  Mainstream media.
[01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:58.030]  Government cover-ups.
[01:58:58.030 --> 01:58:59.611]  You want answers?
[01:58:59.611 --> 01:59:01.151]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:01.151 --> 01:59:05.352]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:05.352 --> 01:59:09.453]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:59:15.647 --> 01:59:17.068]  I've chosen my course.
[01:59:17.068 --> 01:59:20.992]  I'm not rolling over on my back, belly up to these scum.
[01:59:20.992 --> 01:59:25.576]  I'm gonna fight them 110% head on.
[01:59:25.576 --> 01:59:27.177]  I'm gonna call them out for what they are.
[01:59:27.177 --> 01:59:30.320]  A bunch of degenerate, murdering trash.
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:32.982]  A bunch of filth that runs our country.
[01:59:32.982 --> 01:59:38.847]  And if we just start calling them what they are and start getting in their faces and start getting aggressive, they're gonna back off.
[01:59:38.847 --> 01:59:42.971]  But if you roll over, folks, they're gonna go right at your guts and eat you while you're alive.
[01:59:46.328 --> 01:59:48.829]  Well, I just got the proverbial, I'm not doing enough call.
[01:59:48.829 --> 01:59:51.171]  I'm sorry, Mario, I'll try more.
[01:59:51.171 --> 01:59:56.934]  But at least you've gone from the point of saying, I'm making stuff up to being, okay, well then we gotta do something.
[01:59:56.934 --> 01:59:59.856]  Mario, the way we do this is we educate people.
[01:59:59.856 --> 02:00:05.739]  If they're aware that government-sponsored terror is sponsored, then the globalists will stop staging terror because it won't work anymore.
[02:00:07.077 --> 02:00:17.539]  If we expose that global warming man-made is a hoax, and that it's about a global tax, and we have our own documents admitting it, then we can wake people up and deal with the real environmental problems that we truly have.
[02:00:17.539 --> 02:00:29.502]  If we expose the fact that government is very abusive towards the children it seizes, we can make criminal matters of child abuse a local issue, and have some sensible policies.
[02:00:29.502 --> 02:00:34.203]  But if we just sit here and suck our thumbs, it's over for our society.
[02:00:35.589 --> 02:00:39.791]  Now, I believe in humanity, and I believe in goodness, and I don't like evil.
[02:00:39.791 --> 02:00:45.934]  And so I am doing something that is probably not too good for me personally, but I don't care.
[02:00:45.934 --> 02:00:48.815]  I'm committed.
[02:00:48.815 --> 02:00:53.697]  But us collectively, all of you out there taking action, is good for you.
[02:00:53.697 --> 02:00:57.519]  The big joke around here is I'm the canary in the coal mine.
[02:00:57.519 --> 02:00:59.180]  And I just want people to realize the stakes here.
[02:00:59.180 --> 02:01:04.462]  This is not a joke, it's not a game, it's not... This is real, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:05.225 --> 02:01:06.926]  They are bad people.
[02:01:06.926 --> 02:01:10.588]  And the Constitution, the Bill of Rights was erected to defend you.
[02:01:10.588 --> 02:01:13.009]  It was erected to protect your property and your liberty.
[02:01:13.009 --> 02:01:14.410]  It's been removed now.
[02:01:14.410 --> 02:01:17.871]  The hedge is almost completely gone.
[02:01:17.871 --> 02:01:20.353]  Huge holes have been blown in our walls.
[02:01:20.353 --> 02:01:23.794]  We have enemies within and without.
[02:01:23.794 --> 02:01:26.796]  Both physically, mentally, economically.
[02:01:26.796 --> 02:01:28.217]  I mean, we are overrun.
[02:01:28.217 --> 02:01:30.958]  And if you, we could repulse this attack.
[02:01:31.920 --> 02:01:33.181]  But the time is fleeting.
[02:01:33.181 --> 02:01:36.903]  You've got to go to arms in the InfoWars.
[02:01:36.903 --> 02:01:42.587]  I'm so busy, you know, ranting and raving today and covering information that I haven't even really plugged my films.
[02:01:42.587 --> 02:01:45.689]  I hope you'll visit PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:01:45.689 --> 02:01:50.833]  I hope you'll go there and order 100 copies of TerrorStorm.
[02:01:50.833 --> 02:01:51.373]  Give them to people.
[02:01:52.546 --> 02:01:53.427]  There's a big discount.
[02:01:53.427 --> 02:01:57.210]  Or just go download copies for 15 cents a day and burn hundreds of copies.
[02:01:57.210 --> 02:01:58.452]  I don't care how you do it.
[02:01:58.452 --> 02:01:59.092]  At PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:01:59.092 --> 02:02:02.415]  You can download them off Google too, but it's not very good quality.
[02:02:02.415 --> 02:02:06.039]  So I'd do the PrisonPlanet.tv deal if you want to support us.
[02:02:06.039 --> 02:02:10.183]  And literally any money that comes in here is fuel in my gas tank to fight these people.
[02:02:10.183 --> 02:02:11.344]  It's like rocket fuel, folks.
[02:02:11.344 --> 02:02:12.425]  You just fuel us up.
[02:02:12.425 --> 02:02:14.467]  I mean, that's all it is.
[02:02:14.467 --> 02:02:15.247]  Just envision it.
[02:02:15.247 --> 02:02:17.730]  It's just a big old missile out on a launch pad.
[02:02:18.607 --> 02:02:20.008]  You're just filling them up.
[02:02:20.008 --> 02:02:22.089]  And we'll just launch.
[02:02:22.089 --> 02:02:25.851]  10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[02:02:25.851 --> 02:02:26.591]  Ignition!
[02:02:26.591 --> 02:02:28.492]  Liftoff!
[02:02:28.492 --> 02:02:31.294]  Another weapon launched against the New World Order!
[02:02:31.294 --> 02:02:34.476]  Yeah!
[02:02:34.476 --> 02:02:42.320]  I literally, when a new article goes out, or we get a big scoop, or we have an effect on the enemy, I literally just right here in the office go, Yes!
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:43.941]  Yes!
[02:02:43.941 --> 02:02:45.302]  Because I see it for what it is.
[02:02:45.302 --> 02:02:47.863]  And by the way, the globalists brag it's military for them.
[02:02:48.732 --> 02:02:50.033]  It's all military!
[02:02:50.033 --> 02:02:56.976]  Their propaganda, breaking down the family, all that stuff on Fox TV and ABC and the rest of it, all to destroy the family.
[02:02:56.976 --> 02:03:00.197]  They know how to work us!
[02:03:00.197 --> 02:03:04.539]  We're going to come back and go to Wendy, William, Liz, and many others immediately when we get back.
[02:03:04.539 --> 02:03:07.001]  1-800-259-9231 is the number to join us.
[02:03:07.001 --> 02:03:13.784]  I'm going to keep taking calls for another half hour as quickly as possible, then I'm going to get into a bunch of news I haven't covered yet.
[02:03:13.784 --> 02:03:16.325]  But I did go through the tyranny timeline.
[02:03:19.235 --> 02:03:20.095]  So people know.
[02:03:20.095 --> 02:03:25.076]  And maybe we should parallel, at the end of that article, examples of other societies' timelines.
[02:03:25.076 --> 02:03:31.358]  You can already find Nazi timelines, Caesar timeline.
[02:03:31.358 --> 02:03:38.580]  You can find, uh, maybe some Machiavelli passages.
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:44.041]  Oh, what mortal man has to go through, over and over again.
[02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:52.070]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:52.070 --> 02:03:55.111]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:55.111 --> 02:03:59.694]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:59.694 --> 02:04:00.854]  So what do you do?
[02:04:00.854 --> 02:04:05.417]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:05.897 --> 02:04:08.518]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:08.518 --> 02:04:23.266]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:23.266 --> 02:04:30.309]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:30.669 --> 02:04:35.511]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[02:04:51.827 --> 02:04:57.652]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:04:57.652 --> 02:05:05.298]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:05:05.999 --> 02:05:13.442]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:05:13.442 --> 02:05:25.186]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:05:25.186 --> 02:05:29.127]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:05:29.127 --> 02:05:31.408]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:05:31.408 --> 02:05:35.249]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:05:48.882 --> 02:05:51.405]  Do you know that you can go with solar for under $1,200 now?
[02:05:51.405 --> 02:05:53.247]  Hi, this is Ken Soller.
[02:05:53.247 --> 02:05:57.371]  As you may have heard by now, I've been designing alternative energy packages for over a decade.
[02:05:57.978 --> 02:06:03.383]  The solar power generators I produce will get you all the solar power you need for your household essentials.

[02:06:27.417 --> 02:06:34.083]  You know, power companies, government... Anyway, getting yourself free from the utility grid is a lot easier than you might think.

[02:06:48.674 --> 02:06:54.079]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:06:54.079 --> 02:06:56.360]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:07:04.131 --> 02:07:06.092]  Now eight minutes into this third and final hour.
[02:07:06.092 --> 02:07:08.294]  I was just going to Wendy and she hung up.
[02:07:08.294 --> 02:07:09.815]  Wendy, I'm sorry I made you hold.
[02:07:09.815 --> 02:07:11.476]  I wanted to hear from you.
[02:07:11.476 --> 02:07:12.877]  It was the first time caller, too.
[02:07:12.877 --> 02:07:16.099]  She had two people that disagreed in front of you.
[02:07:16.099 --> 02:07:19.301]  Call me back tomorrow and I promise I'll put you ahead of the line, Wendy.
[02:07:19.301 --> 02:07:21.522]  William!
[02:07:21.522 --> 02:07:23.023]  In California, then Liz and others.
[02:07:23.023 --> 02:07:26.545]  Go ahead, William.
[02:07:26.545 --> 02:07:28.226]  Okay, William's not there either.
[02:07:28.226 --> 02:07:30.207]  Let's go ahead and talk to Liz in Pennsylvania.
[02:07:30.207 --> 02:07:31.048]  You're on the air, Liz.
[02:07:32.552 --> 02:07:33.953]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[02:07:33.953 --> 02:07:34.573]  Fantastic.
[02:07:34.573 --> 02:07:36.614]  What's on your mind today?
[02:07:36.614 --> 02:07:44.558]  Um, first of all, I just wanted to thank you for putting your neck out there and for talking about some of this stuff.
[02:07:44.558 --> 02:08:02.087]  I think a lot of people find it unbelievable and I noticed the way you speak and you try to direct your speech so that you're speaking to young people, old people, all people alike so they can understand it on their level and that's commendable.
[02:08:03.251 --> 02:08:04.892]  Well, really, there is no rhyme or reason.
[02:08:04.892 --> 02:08:08.415]  I just go off the info and don't even try to package what I'm doing.
[02:08:08.415 --> 02:08:13.759]  Well, God packages it, probably.
[02:08:13.759 --> 02:08:30.911]  I actually... I just wanted to comment on what you were talking about earlier about people being... women being... you were talking about women
[02:08:31.601 --> 02:08:34.523]  Feeling as though they are valueless the older they get?
[02:08:34.523 --> 02:08:36.505]  Yes.
[02:08:36.505 --> 02:08:54.760]  I also wanted to point out that in our media, it's definitely in our media as far as, I think that we need to be really careful what things we get sucked into because we can all get sucked into it.
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:56.782]  I'm talking Harry Potter, I'm talking
[02:08:57.426 --> 02:08:59.568]  Possibly Lord of the Rings.
[02:08:59.568 --> 02:09:05.572]  All these things that are intended to grab us and cause us to go into escape mode.
[02:09:05.572 --> 02:09:06.953]  It's a very spiritual battle.
[02:09:08.206 --> 02:09:09.066]  That's all I wanted to say.
[02:09:09.066 --> 02:09:19.731]  Well, once you've gotten out of... Most people don't even know about the real world, and so once you get out of escape mode and see the Matrix, I think it's okay to duck back into fantasy sometimes.
[02:09:19.731 --> 02:09:24.433]  You need that to stay sane and, you know, sometimes just disengage.
[02:09:24.433 --> 02:09:29.695]  But yeah, I know most people have never even gotten out of that mode, and so that's the problem.
[02:09:29.695 --> 02:09:35.037]  I think, as a Roman philosopher said, that
[02:09:38.875 --> 02:09:40.736]  Moderation is the key.
[02:09:40.736 --> 02:09:42.756]  Moderation.
[02:09:42.756 --> 02:09:44.737]  But what else is on your mind?
[02:09:44.737 --> 02:09:46.997]  That was pretty much it.
[02:09:46.997 --> 02:09:57.940]  Well, my point is, is that Madison Avenue, women have always been vain, men are vain too, but Madison Avenue, I mean, admittedly, I mean, they teach this in college, is there to make you feel inadequate to then sell you products.
[02:09:57.940 --> 02:10:01.101]  I mean, that's their angle, the way they like to sell theirs.
[02:10:01.101 --> 02:10:06.663]  Instead of necessity being, you know, mother or father of invention, you know, hey, you need this, they sell things
[02:10:08.146 --> 02:10:10.587]  Predominantly that you don't need.
[02:10:10.587 --> 02:10:25.875]  And they also build up these archetypes that feel unattainable, so that you're always reaching for something instead of... They give you false values that a bunch of bling is more important than being a good parent.
[02:10:25.875 --> 02:10:30.078]  Or a bunch of bling is more important than doing the right thing.
[02:10:30.078 --> 02:10:34.520]  And then, well, if you get bling, it doesn't matter what you did to get bling.
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:36.541]  And really, all bling is is a joke.
[02:10:38.317 --> 02:10:41.781]  I mean, all bling is, is a target for criminals to come after you.
[02:10:41.781 --> 02:10:45.345]  I mean, it just gets off into more complex issues.
[02:10:45.345 --> 02:10:53.233]  Primitive, mindless, degenerate societies, and I'm not saying primitive is necessarily degenerate, but primitive, degenerate societies, it's all about bling.
[02:10:54.591 --> 02:11:03.757]  And then you notice even in primitive societies that were more uplifted and more artful and more into science that they were going away from bling.
[02:11:03.757 --> 02:11:08.440]  Bling is just another symbol of massive decadence and decline.
[02:11:08.440 --> 02:11:11.102]  It is only a symptom of a greater illness.
[02:11:11.102 --> 02:11:23.731]  I just wanted to... The box office and all these movies and stuff, it creates a false sense of if you attain
[02:11:26.133 --> 02:11:28.834]  I know a lot of Hollywood people.
[02:11:28.834 --> 02:11:31.254]  I've met a lot of Hollywood people.
[02:11:31.254 --> 02:11:32.335]  I've gotten to know a few of them.
[02:11:55.663 --> 02:11:57.083]  Really well.
[02:11:57.083 --> 02:12:03.865]  And by and large, the stars hate their fame.
[02:12:03.865 --> 02:12:07.185]  Because I've met a lot of big stars that have been stars for a long time.
[02:12:07.185 --> 02:12:09.086]  And they can't stand it.
[02:12:09.086 --> 02:12:10.106]  And they just want to be left alone.
[02:12:10.106 --> 02:12:13.347]  They want to be around real people.
[02:12:13.347 --> 02:12:15.847]  And a lot of them are pretty sad.
[02:12:15.847 --> 02:12:22.288]  But then you look at some high school kid who thinks of movie stars as like gods.
[02:12:22.288 --> 02:12:23.869]  I mean, that's a lot of growing up.
[02:12:23.869 --> 02:12:25.149]  But there's a lot of adults who
[02:12:28.948 --> 02:12:32.991]  They're like children, and it's just, oh my gosh, Hollywood.
[02:12:32.991 --> 02:12:41.598]  The only reason Hollywood's interesting to me is that it's so useful in reaching the generally brain-dead public.
[02:12:41.598 --> 02:12:44.961]  It's a very powerful info-war tool.
[02:12:44.961 --> 02:12:51.026]  And it's also interesting to know Hollywood people who do have courage and who are willing to speak out against things.
[02:12:51.026 --> 02:12:53.728]  Markedly, they'll be interesting people, to say the least.
[02:12:53.728 --> 02:12:55.069]  I've met a few Hollywood stars, women,
[02:13:00.245 --> 02:13:03.686]  And then you're, I'm always shocked by it, they're more beautiful in person than they are on the screen.
[02:13:03.686 --> 02:13:08.466]  You would think, let's just put it this way, stars are stars for a reason.
[02:13:08.466 --> 02:13:16.148]  They have some type of, some type of aura, something about them, something unusual about them.
[02:13:16.148 --> 02:13:18.608]  Like, I never thought Winona Ryder was good looking.
[02:13:18.608 --> 02:13:22.389]  I thought she was okay looking, but it wasn't my type, you know.
[02:13:22.389 --> 02:13:24.609]  And I'm not getting off into this, it's just an example.
[02:13:24.609 --> 02:13:25.949]  My type is my wife.
[02:13:25.949 --> 02:13:29.510]  But, you know, knowing her, meeting her, being in a scene with her,
[02:13:30.353 --> 02:13:32.775]  Get to know an honor rider.
[02:13:32.775 --> 02:13:34.516]  And again, I wasn't even attracted to her, folks.
[02:13:34.516 --> 02:13:35.476]  I've gone past that point.
[02:13:35.476 --> 02:13:40.259]  My point is, is that just in person, she radiated life.
[02:13:40.259 --> 02:13:44.322]  It was just she, you know, she had a real, of course, she's pretty nuts, too.
[02:13:44.322 --> 02:13:47.704]  But the point is, is that is that you actually get around Hollywood stars.
[02:13:47.704 --> 02:13:49.766]  They are exceptional people.
[02:13:49.766 --> 02:13:53.888]  That's there's something about them that that's why on the screen they do what they do.
[02:13:53.888 --> 02:13:55.629]  Boy, you talk about digressing.
[02:13:55.629 --> 02:13:57.751]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[02:14:00.285 --> 02:14:04.426]  Tony in California, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:14:04.426 --> 02:14:04.886]  Good morning.
[02:14:04.886 --> 02:14:06.527]  Hi, how are you doing?
[02:14:06.527 --> 02:14:07.827]  I'm doing well, how are you?
[02:14:07.827 --> 02:14:09.948]  Good.
[02:14:09.948 --> 02:14:20.091]  I want to say that you're doing a great job, too, and yeah, I believe that people really do have a hard time understanding and growing up and staying children.
[02:14:20.091 --> 02:14:28.194]  A lot of people really just, you know, they listen to music and they don't even realize that there's a message behind that music.
[02:14:28.194 --> 02:14:29.154]  My question today
[02:14:29.853 --> 02:14:40.661]  Yeah, that just ended the 133rd or 4th annual meeting.
[02:14:40.661 --> 02:14:43.864]  Yeah, that's what I wanted to know was the time.
[02:14:43.864 --> 02:14:57.875]  A friend of mine had a buddy come over and he had this list of the camps and camp members and key to camp locations for the Bohemian Grove for the 2007 midsummer encampment.
[02:14:58.550 --> 02:15:06.272]  Well, it was founded in 1873, so that's 27 years and then another 107, and there's your answer.
[02:15:06.272 --> 02:15:11.253]  Okay, and when did it occur this year?
[02:15:11.253 --> 02:15:12.293]  July 15th to July 30th, 1st.
[02:15:12.293 --> 02:15:13.773]  Okay, just standard.
[02:15:13.773 --> 02:15:13.973]  Okay.
[02:15:24.050 --> 02:15:31.894]  Yeah, I just thought it was interesting to see all these names on the list and find out who's in whose camp and such and such like that.
[02:15:31.894 --> 02:15:34.555]  So, thank you very much.
[02:15:34.555 --> 02:15:36.056]  That's what I wanted to know.
[02:15:36.056 --> 02:15:37.457]  Tony, good to hear from you.
[02:15:37.457 --> 02:15:39.318]  Phil in Tennessee, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:15:39.318 --> 02:15:45.901]  I love how they wait to hang up until you go to them.
[02:15:45.901 --> 02:15:48.822]  Steve, where are you calling from today, Steve?
[02:15:48.822 --> 02:15:49.623]  Hello, Alex.
[02:15:49.623 --> 02:15:51.163]  Yes, Steve, where are you calling from?
[02:15:51.163 --> 02:15:51.524]  Chicago.
[02:15:52.998 --> 02:15:54.158]  Thank you.
[02:15:54.158 --> 02:16:07.561]  Listen, I don't know if you're aware of this, but it's almost going back to feudalistic times, because this Cory Rose situation, where the press gang come and got him, and then they shanghaied him and clapped him in heavy irons and dragged him down.
[02:16:07.561 --> 02:16:11.461]  And the public doesn't know that shanghai comes from a San Francisco term.
[02:16:11.461 --> 02:16:14.002]  They don't know what a press gang was in England.
[02:16:14.002 --> 02:16:16.042]  The press gang, they don't know anything.
[02:16:16.042 --> 02:16:18.903]  And so they hear you say that again, you can't even communicate with the general public.
[02:16:18.903 --> 02:16:19.403]  Go ahead and try.
[02:16:20.908 --> 02:16:21.909]  Well, you know what I fear?
[02:16:21.909 --> 02:16:30.873]  I fear they're going to stick him like in a penal company and then zip him to the front and then... You know, I really want to hear what you have to say, but it's like your phone's muffled.
[02:16:30.873 --> 02:16:31.774]  Oh.
[02:16:31.774 --> 02:16:33.074]  Is this better?
[02:16:33.074 --> 02:16:33.995]  Yeah.
[02:16:33.995 --> 02:16:35.435]  Did you put your hand over it or...?
[02:16:35.435 --> 02:16:37.476]  Yeah, I guess I was a little bit over it.
[02:16:37.476 --> 02:16:39.077]  But at any rate... You can start over.
[02:16:39.077 --> 02:16:39.878]  Go ahead.
[02:16:39.878 --> 02:16:40.418]  Okay, well...
[02:16:41.168 --> 02:16:49.915]  What I'm concerned about is they're going to take him and some of these other people, and I could cite examples where Army CID went into Nelson, British Columbia.
[02:16:49.915 --> 02:16:55.140]  I know you had that Lady Fogel on last week, and grabbed a serviceman there.
[02:16:55.140 --> 02:17:01.365]  They went after somebody, his name was, I forget, it escapes me, but he was in Toronto.
[02:17:01.365 --> 02:17:05.268]  These guys are like extra-legal, you know, violating foreign sovereignty.
[02:17:05.268 --> 02:17:10.352]  But the thing is, is that what they're going to do is they're probably going to stick him in a penal company, send him to the front, get him killed.
[02:17:10.768 --> 02:17:17.010]  Then they'll come back and be looking at radishes from the bottom side up, and that's what I'm concerned about.
[02:17:17.010 --> 02:17:19.151]  Well, yeah.
[02:17:19.151 --> 02:17:19.991]  Look, here's the deal.
[02:17:19.991 --> 02:17:21.892]  People are confused by it.
[02:17:21.892 --> 02:17:23.072]  He signed up for three years.
[02:17:23.072 --> 02:17:24.733]  He spent more than three years.
[02:17:24.733 --> 02:17:28.434]  He'd been over in Iraq a year, been in Afghanistan close to a year.
[02:17:29.519 --> 02:17:32.541]  And then his time was up, and they said, no, no, no, you didn't read the contract.
[02:17:32.541 --> 02:17:34.622]  We can keep you for eight years.
[02:17:34.622 --> 02:17:36.142]  And he said, I don't get a break.
[02:17:36.142 --> 02:17:38.523]  And so he said, no, I'm out.
[02:17:38.523 --> 02:17:41.425]  Then they arrested him once, 19 months ago.
[02:17:41.425 --> 02:17:43.366]  They let him go and said, OK, you're discharged.
[02:17:43.366 --> 02:17:44.086]  He got his papers.
[02:17:44.086 --> 02:17:45.167]  He has those.
[02:17:45.167 --> 02:17:49.809]  Then they pick him up again and then let him go again up at Fort Drum.
[02:17:49.809 --> 02:17:52.050]  He said, no, I'm going down there voluntarily.
[02:17:52.050 --> 02:17:53.470]  I'm tired of this.
[02:17:53.470 --> 02:17:55.912]  And I mean, there's video of him at the airport by himself.
[02:17:55.912 --> 02:17:56.712]  He went and got on a plane and left.
[02:17:57.339 --> 02:18:06.885]  And then now, he's down there and they're saying, now you've got to go to Fort Knox and on and on and on.
[02:18:06.885 --> 02:18:09.926]  And for those who don't know, yes, they're making people serve.
[02:18:09.926 --> 02:18:13.348]  Some people are starting their fifth tours in Iraq.
[02:18:13.348 --> 02:18:16.010]  Okay, folks, five tours.
[02:18:16.010 --> 02:18:17.551]  I mean, that's never before been done.
[02:18:19.642 --> 02:18:20.643]  Anything else, sir?
[02:18:20.643 --> 02:18:21.464]  Uh, that'll be it.
[02:18:21.464 --> 02:18:22.024]  Thanks.
[02:18:22.024 --> 02:18:24.086]  Are you sure you don't want to add anything else?
[02:18:24.086 --> 02:18:34.315]  Uh, no, other than the, you know, the listing that I got was like, uh, Fort Dix for the, for those Chapter 11, I think they call them Chapter 11 discharges.
[02:18:34.315 --> 02:18:41.522]  Yeah, but from where his records are at Fort Knox and they're, you know, they got Corey back in uniform, creeping around.
[02:18:41.522 --> 02:18:45.045]  Oh boy, we'll be right back.
[02:18:50.777 --> 02:18:55.639]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:18:55.639 --> 02:19:00.000]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:00.861]  We listened.
[02:19:00.861 --> 02:19:06.123]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:06.123 --> 02:19:06.583]  We listened.
[02:19:06.983 --> 02:19:10.446]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:19:10.446 --> 02:19:11.447]  We listened.
[02:19:11.447 --> 02:19:15.911]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:19:15.911 --> 02:19:16.711]  We listened.
[02:19:16.711 --> 02:19:22.376]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:19:22.376 --> 02:19:24.098]  Again, we listened.
[02:19:24.098 --> 02:19:25.879]  Introducing the Berkey Light.
[02:19:25.879 --> 02:19:31.424]  The gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[02:19:38.490 --> 02:19:39.891]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, here for the 2007 Red Book.
[02:19:54.958 --> 02:20:00.002]  The commodity markets like gold, silver, copper, aluminum and oil have exploded over the last year.
[02:20:00.002 --> 02:20:02.784]  This is a glaring testimony of how quickly the U.S.
[02:20:02.784 --> 02:20:05.225]  dollar can be devalued.
[02:20:05.225 --> 02:20:10.769]  Many have turned to precious metals to provide a safe haven while increasing the potential profits.
[02:20:10.769 --> 02:20:19.035]  Though accumulating precious metals has been a proven method for the storage of wealth, it is important that you understand the market you are getting into.
[02:20:19.035 --> 02:20:22.097]  Midas Resources is offering the red book and silver dollar for only $27.95.
[02:20:24.227 --> 02:20:28.669]  The Red Book is the number one best-selling guide to gold and silver coins.
[02:20:28.669 --> 02:20:30.170]  Call for your copy today.
[02:20:30.170 --> 02:20:33.452]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:33.452 --> 02:20:39.875]  If you've already accumulated or plan to get into the precious metals market, you simply must have the Red Book in your library.
[02:20:39.875 --> 02:20:40.035]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:40.035 --> 02:20:40.375]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:48.169 --> 02:20:51.090]  I need to do something about my dry heels.
[02:20:51.090 --> 02:20:52.910]  After a pedicure, they look great.
[02:20:52.910 --> 02:20:57.171]  Then I have to go right back again because my feet get dry so quickly.
[02:20:57.171 --> 02:20:59.812]  Haven't you heard about CalX ointment?
[02:20:59.812 --> 02:21:03.533]  I use it regularly on my heels and they stay looking great.
[02:21:03.533 --> 02:21:06.514]  And my feet feel as good as they look.
[02:21:06.514 --> 02:21:07.954]  What's that name again?
[02:21:07.954 --> 02:21:09.515]  Wait, I'm getting my pen out.
[02:21:09.515 --> 02:21:11.095]  It's CalX.
[02:21:11.095 --> 02:21:13.275]  C-A-L-L-E-X.
[02:21:13.275 --> 02:21:15.136]  What makes CalX ointment so different?
[02:21:15.919 --> 02:21:24.947]  It's got these natural enzymes that quickly exfoliate dry, cracked feet and leave your feet feeling soft and smooth, just like a baby's bottom.
[02:21:24.947 --> 02:21:31.072]  For soft, smooth heels and feet, use enzyme-rich, moisturizing CalX ointment.
[02:21:31.072 --> 02:21:42.201]  It's diabetic-friendly and found in the foot care section of Walgreens, Long's, Snyder's Drug, Phyllo, Card Drug, HEB grocery stores, medicine shop pharmacies, and Rite Aid.
[02:21:42.839 --> 02:21:44.300]  Hey, here's a drugstore.
[02:21:44.300 --> 02:21:45.081]  I'll be right back.
[02:21:45.081 --> 02:21:47.943]  I'm getting some Calix for my heels.
[02:21:47.943 --> 02:21:51.045]  Are you concerned about the high cost of prescription drugs?

[02:22:40.954 --> 02:22:41.614]  Do it today!
[02:22:56.435 --> 02:23:14.486]  We're going to find out in the next few months, the next few years, whether this was the fall of the Republic into a high-tech scientific dictatorship, or whether this was the rise of the Republic, the fall of the New World Order.
[02:23:14.486 --> 02:23:21.111]  If they win, ladies and gentlemen, you're going to go through unimaginable grief.
[02:23:21.111 --> 02:23:22.672]  If they win, you're going to go through a lot of pain.
[02:23:23.903 --> 02:23:28.084]  If we win, it's certainly a brighter tomorrow.
[02:23:28.084 --> 02:23:30.484]  Let's go to the calls.
[02:23:30.484 --> 02:23:35.005]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Oklahoma, then Omar, Alex, Steve, Will, and others.
[02:23:35.005 --> 02:23:36.585]  Go ahead, John, you're on the air.
[02:23:36.585 --> 02:23:37.966]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[02:23:37.966 --> 02:23:41.526]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:23:41.526 --> 02:23:43.607]  I've been listening to you for a long time.
[02:23:43.607 --> 02:23:50.508]  I woke up about 15 years ago when I lived in Austin, and you were talking about Waco and Oklahoma City and some things like that.
[02:23:51.348 --> 02:23:59.314]  But I wanted to call today and let you know in Tulsa a lot of folks are waking up and getting busy with some things.
[02:23:59.314 --> 02:24:04.859]  In fact, Wednesday night we've got William Rodriguez and he's going to be speaking at the Renaissance Hotel.
[02:24:06.497 --> 02:24:07.558]  At 7 o'clock.
[02:24:07.558 --> 02:24:09.078]  It's 10 bucks ahead.
[02:24:09.078 --> 02:24:15.461]  We've already sold about 140 tickets and he's coming in to talk to the folks at Tulsa.
[02:24:15.461 --> 02:24:15.941]  That's great.
[02:24:15.941 --> 02:24:18.142]  He's coming into Austin next week too, I think.
[02:24:18.142 --> 02:24:24.465]  Yeah, he's making a tour around Texas, but we were able to get him up here and we're really excited about it.
[02:24:24.465 --> 02:24:25.366]  Well, that's fantastic.
[02:24:25.366 --> 02:24:25.966]  Anything else, John?
[02:24:26.738 --> 02:24:28.319]  Well, not a whole lot else.
[02:24:28.319 --> 02:24:33.260]  Just wanted to let everybody know about that and say thank you for what you're doing.
[02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:39.102]  We've got a website called pulsatruth.org and you can check that out.
[02:24:39.102 --> 02:24:44.504]  I think we've submitted some videos to you and some things like that in the past.
[02:24:44.504 --> 02:24:46.865]  We're just trying to fight the good fight.
[02:24:46.865 --> 02:24:49.786]  Keep it up my friend and say hi to Willie for me.
[02:24:49.786 --> 02:24:51.707]  Let's go ahead and go to Omar in Michigan.
[02:24:51.707 --> 02:24:52.607]  Omar, you're on the air.
[02:24:52.607 --> 02:24:53.687]  Go ahead.
[02:24:53.687 --> 02:24:54.828]  Yeah, I'm Omar.
[02:24:56.501 --> 02:25:16.056]  Brother General of the Black Panther Militia, I've been fighting the New World Order since 1990 officially, since 1985 unofficially, trying to educate people, and what I found out, y'all just a bunch of wimps, the majority of you.
[02:25:16.056 --> 02:25:25.443]  The women got more courage than you men to stand here and let the United Nations New World Order
[02:25:26.636 --> 02:25:31.999]  Bush or whoever tell you that they're going to do what they're going to do to you.
[02:25:31.999 --> 02:25:34.881]  And you're not going to even stand up.
[02:25:34.881 --> 02:25:37.143]  You're worse than a boot licker to me.
[02:25:37.143 --> 02:25:39.464]  And you deserve what you get.
[02:25:39.464 --> 02:25:42.886]  I'm sick of you wimps calling in to Alex Jones.
[02:25:42.886 --> 02:25:50.191]  This man, just like Bill Cooper, done put his life on the line to raise you scumbags up.
[02:25:50.191 --> 02:25:55.054]  And you won't even stand up for your own country, let alone your family.
[02:25:55.765 --> 02:25:59.428]  That's gonna be destroyed and put in concentration camps.
[02:25:59.428 --> 02:26:01.389]  They done experimented on you.
[02:26:01.389 --> 02:26:05.753]  They done did everything they can, killing you wholesale.
[02:26:05.753 --> 02:26:18.222]  I sat up and cried September 11, 2001, when I seen all them innocent, value-producing people having to jump out of windows because their own country betrayed them.
[02:26:18.222 --> 02:26:23.847]  And now you people call in on this information program
[02:26:24.637 --> 02:26:32.800]  And tell this man he's lying when you can read the papers and research it for yourself like Bill Cooper used to say.
[02:26:32.800 --> 02:26:34.420]  Don't believe me.
[02:26:34.420 --> 02:26:36.361]  Go research it for yourself.
[02:26:36.361 --> 02:26:45.143]  Get them house bills and presidential directives off of the Freedom of Information Act for yourself.
[02:26:45.143 --> 02:26:48.324]  But you scum not even worth saving.
[02:26:48.324 --> 02:26:50.225]  And that's my statement.
[02:26:50.225 --> 02:26:53.446]  Omar, did it make you mad hearing that guy criticize us that we're not doing enough?
[02:26:55.859 --> 02:26:56.659]  He hung up.
[02:26:56.659 --> 02:26:59.100]  I know, it makes me mad, too.
[02:26:59.100 --> 02:27:01.141]  Folks!
[02:27:01.141 --> 02:27:02.062]  He's right!
[02:27:02.062 --> 02:27:08.425]  And I know a lot of our listeners are taking action, but just the general public... I mean, it freaks me out, too.
[02:27:08.425 --> 02:27:14.607]  I, uh... I mean, I always think I've got it all figured out, and then I find out how dumb I am.
[02:27:14.607 --> 02:27:21.691]  I mean, to just run into hundreds of books and thousands of documents where they say they're gonna kill us, and they're putting cancer in us, and everything else.
[02:27:21.691 --> 02:27:24.732]  I mean, I'm just... I mean, we're living in a complete fruitcake land!
[02:27:26.753 --> 02:27:33.736]  And I just can't get these people with all the, you know, bobbles hanging off of them to even listen to me half the time.
[02:27:33.736 --> 02:27:35.157]  But they don't count, folks.
[02:27:35.157 --> 02:27:42.440]  It's going to be a small minority that is always going to change history.
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:44.861]  And I am a kindred spirit with people like Omar out there.
[02:27:44.861 --> 02:27:49.182]  I remember Omar calling into the show, and I know he's done some good work up in Michigan, I've heard about him.
[02:27:49.182 --> 02:27:51.663]  I remember Omar calling into my show 12 years ago, 11 years ago.
[02:27:54.825 --> 02:27:58.467]  And the problem is, is people that really do care tend to get stressed out and angry and wild.
[02:27:58.467 --> 02:27:59.428]  That's what happened to William Cooper.
[02:27:59.428 --> 02:28:01.069]  He did a great job, by the way.
[02:28:01.069 --> 02:28:04.992]  You know, at the end there, he was really freaked out and saw all the stuff coming down.
[02:28:04.992 --> 02:28:08.454]  And boy, they went over to his house and killed him real good.
[02:28:08.454 --> 02:28:10.175]  They've told me they're going to do the same thing.
[02:28:10.175 --> 02:28:14.377]  I, uh... I'm not even really worried about it, though.
[02:28:14.377 --> 02:28:15.618]  It's weird.
[02:28:15.618 --> 02:28:21.201]  Just kind of like... Like a feather riding on the wind.
[02:28:21.201 --> 02:28:21.782]  I just know this.
[02:28:23.502 --> 02:28:25.784]  I'm not going along with these people.
[02:28:25.784 --> 02:28:28.206]  And I am not going to get down and lick their boots.
[02:28:28.206 --> 02:28:36.252]  And I am not going to get... And just all these... All the people on Fox and CNN all painted up, lying, and they love the evil.
[02:28:36.252 --> 02:28:39.315]  I mean, it's just sick.
[02:28:39.315 --> 02:28:40.736]  We're on the march.
[02:28:40.736 --> 02:28:43.238]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:28:43.238 --> 02:28:45.920]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:28:49.332 --> 02:28:55.276]  Why continue suffering from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?

[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:06.785]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:29:07.225 --> 02:29:14.248]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:29:14.248 --> 02:29:16.149]  There are no reported side effects.
[02:29:16.149 --> 02:29:19.611]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:29:19.611 --> 02:29:22.372]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[02:29:58.671 --> 02:29:59.652]  Hard-hitting?
[02:29:59.652 --> 02:30:02.634]  The first issue discusses two vital questions.
[02:30:02.634 --> 02:30:04.656]  War in Iran?
[02:30:04.656 --> 02:30:06.298]  A coming One World Church?
[02:30:07.058 --> 02:30:12.884]  And the first issue has included a pungent discussion of NWO numerology.

[02:30:49.116 --> 02:30:52.118]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:30:52.118 --> 02:30:59.443]  Did you know that there is a concentration camp program that was designed during the Ronald Reagan administration called Rex 84?
[02:30:59.443 --> 02:31:05.427]  This program is designed to imprison anyone whom the federal government deems an enemy of the state.
[02:31:05.427 --> 02:31:17.175]  A judge in Houston, Texas declared that the plaintiff had proven that there was such a program that existed, but no one had been harmed or imprisoned by it, so he declared it unconstitutional and dismissed the case.

[02:32:22.275 --> 02:32:24.137]  I'll send an S.O.S.
[02:32:24.137 --> 02:32:25.058]  to the world.
[02:32:25.058 --> 02:32:26.760]  I'll send an S.O.S.
[02:32:26.760 --> 02:32:27.641]  to the world.
[02:32:27.641 --> 02:32:40.238]  I hope that someone gets my... I hope that someone gets my... I hope that someone gets my message in a bottle, yeah.
[02:32:47.020 --> 02:32:56.871]  Folks, the answer is to get off the grid as much as you can, to be self-sufficient, and to have some friends and family and people you can count on.
[02:32:56.871 --> 02:32:58.753]  And remember who your people are.
[02:32:58.753 --> 02:33:01.436]  They say on this culture of death, you know, what matters is your people.
[02:33:03.050 --> 02:33:04.431]  And I want you to listen very carefully.
[02:33:04.431 --> 02:33:11.395]  I want you to get prepared with food, and the J. Michael Stevens Group with Steven Shank, you heard on with us Friday, is the place to go.
[02:33:11.395 --> 02:33:14.357]  The oldest, longest, continual company.
[02:33:14.357 --> 02:33:16.618]  Highest quality and just insanely low prices.
[02:33:16.618 --> 02:33:16.738]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:16.738 --> 02:33:16.838]  1-800-409-5633.
[02:33:16.838 --> 02:33:17.438]  Or efoodsdirect.com.
[02:33:24.995 --> 02:33:26.216]  They use food as a weapon.
[02:33:26.216 --> 02:33:27.257]  They use it to control you.
[02:33:27.257 --> 02:33:32.942]  They've said they're going to do it, and if we're going to have a recession or whatever, this is high-quality, storable food you can eat when times get hard.
[02:33:32.942 --> 02:33:34.703]  And it lasts more than 10 years.
[02:33:34.703 --> 02:33:36.725]  But tend to be conservative.
[02:33:36.725 --> 02:33:46.033]  1-800-409-5633, efoodsdirect.com, or check out their banner on prisonplanet.com, or infowars.com.
[02:33:46.033 --> 02:33:51.137]  And then, of course, ladies and gentlemen, there's also inner food.
[02:33:52.572 --> 02:33:54.213]  And I've heard about InnerFood for years.
[02:33:54.213 --> 02:33:57.155]  I finally started trying it about four or five months ago.
[02:33:57.155 --> 02:33:59.576]  And now my whole office is on it.
[02:33:59.576 --> 02:34:00.977]  And it's just really good green food.
[02:34:00.977 --> 02:34:08.120]  The best vitamins and minerals from plants, and from vegetables and fruits.
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:12.503]  Do yourself a favor, check out their website, enerfood.com.
[02:34:12.503 --> 02:34:12.903]  And they've got
[02:34:13.590 --> 02:34:14.610]  Coconut powder.
[02:34:14.610 --> 02:34:18.151]  They've got their green food, their inner food, their mainline product, their big product.
[02:34:18.151 --> 02:34:22.992]  They've got special Arabica bean coffee that's also been soaked in these special mushrooms.
[02:34:22.992 --> 02:34:24.373]  1-866-762-9238.
[02:34:24.373 --> 02:34:27.994]  Give them a call.
[02:34:27.994 --> 02:34:29.674]  Ask for a free catalog.
[02:34:29.674 --> 02:34:32.895]  Ask about a 20% discount with bulk orders for my listeners.
[02:34:32.895 --> 02:34:34.395]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get that.
[02:34:34.395 --> 02:34:35.576]  866-762-9238 or enerfood.com.
[02:34:35.576 --> 02:34:36.416]  Great stuff.
[02:34:36.416 --> 02:34:36.976]  Give them a call.
[02:34:42.464 --> 02:34:43.585]  I'm calm now, but I've been very angry.
[02:35:04.324 --> 02:35:07.266]  For probably the last year, and he's absolutely right.
[02:35:07.266 --> 02:35:15.411]  People that know about it, they know about it, but then they're still like, oh, but, you know, I've got to keep my head down, or else new and old is going to come get me.
[02:35:15.411 --> 02:35:18.654]  If everyone has that attitude, then we're never going to get anywhere.
[02:35:18.654 --> 02:35:20.014]  We all need to stand up.
[02:35:20.014 --> 02:35:20.895]  Well, it's worse than that.
[02:35:20.895 --> 02:35:22.256]  We're not just going to get anywhere.
[02:35:22.256 --> 02:35:24.077]  If we have an attitude, we better keep our head down.
[02:35:24.077 --> 02:35:27.319]  They're going to be able to have their way with us.
[02:35:27.319 --> 02:35:28.720]  See, people think I've got all this courage.
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:30.121]  It's not courage, folks.
[02:35:30.121 --> 02:35:32.903]  When some big bully's coming down on me, I've got to fight back.
[02:35:33.829 --> 02:35:34.811]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:34.811 --> 02:35:35.973]  We just have no choice.
[02:35:35.973 --> 02:35:38.779]  It's not a matter of, oh, I don't want to get in trouble.
[02:35:38.779 --> 02:35:42.727]  You're going to get in trouble anyway when, you know, the stuff hits the fan.
[02:35:45.387 --> 02:35:50.430]  But I was the caller yesterday with the Jabilon voice.
[02:35:50.430 --> 02:35:53.332]  I was calling about Bill Cooper, but you were talking to the mic.
[02:35:53.332 --> 02:35:54.573]  Bill Cooper's been coming up a lot.
[02:35:54.573 --> 02:35:55.934]  Okay, I thought it was some mean prank.
[02:35:55.934 --> 02:35:57.235]  Go ahead and do yours.
[02:35:57.235 --> 02:36:01.077]  I had that Mason on yesterday about all the kids and the CHIP program, yeah.
[02:36:01.077 --> 02:36:04.879]  Yeah, I couldn't resist doing the Jabilon voice because of him.
[02:36:04.879 --> 02:36:07.281]  So, with Bill Cooper, all right.
[02:36:07.964 --> 02:36:11.106]  Um, I didn't even know about him until about a year ago.
[02:36:11.106 --> 02:36:18.491]  Somebody gave me his Mystery Babylon series, and then I listened to it, and then after I heard it, my friend was like, uh, you know, he's dead, right?
[02:36:18.491 --> 02:36:24.575]  I almost cried, but, um, what, uh, his camp and yours don't seem to get along.
[02:36:24.575 --> 02:36:25.576]  Uh, that's my first question.
[02:36:25.576 --> 02:36:27.217]  Why, why is that?
[02:36:27.217 --> 02:36:29.178]  Look, uh, and I appreciate your call.
[02:36:29.178 --> 02:36:32.900]  I gotta move quick here, sir, and I know it's not about me.
[02:36:32.900 --> 02:36:35.222]  Frankly, I don't like Fox News talking about me.
[02:36:36.098 --> 02:36:43.323]  That's why I sent my producer at the time to be on Fox TV show Planet Mankal.
[02:36:43.323 --> 02:36:55.893]  Frankly, it's gotten to the point where I want to reach people, I want my websites to be big, I want to have an effect, I want to have our articles be read, but at the same time, it's not even a cowardly thing, it's that it does nothing.
[02:36:55.893 --> 02:36:57.414]  I don't want some cult of personality.
[02:36:58.104 --> 02:37:07.089]  I want this to be about you being leaders, you taking action, and frankly, I don't like people asking me about Bill, because I liked Bill, and I don't like having to tell you the truth, okay?
[02:37:07.089 --> 02:37:13.512]  I don't like on that sub, because I can't basically lie to you, and I don't like having to say bad things about Bill.
[02:37:13.512 --> 02:37:15.954]  Okay?
[02:37:15.954 --> 02:37:25.619]  I alluded to it with the last caller, and that is that a lot of people crack up under the stress of this stuff.
[02:37:26.323 --> 02:37:29.745]  And, folks, he'd been in Vietnam a gunboat captain.
[02:37:29.745 --> 02:37:32.707]  And, you know, he'd lost a leg being run off the road by these people.
[02:37:32.707 --> 02:37:33.667]  And he'd been death-threatened.
[02:37:33.667 --> 02:37:42.292]  And they'd done all kinds of stuff to the point of he had to have his wife and children leave because of the threats he was getting.
[02:37:42.292 --> 02:37:47.395]  But can you imagine Bill Cooper, who's all about being super accurate and all about how he's, you know, doing this?
[02:37:47.395 --> 02:37:50.998]  He hears this 20... When he first started listening to me, I was like 22 years old.
[02:37:53.832 --> 02:37:57.814]  I mean, Cooper only predates me by a couple years.
[02:37:57.814 --> 02:37:59.255]  And so Cooper knew who I was.
[02:37:59.255 --> 02:38:00.536]  He always heard my name.
[02:38:00.536 --> 02:38:05.778]  And the Genesis Network asked me in 1998, you want the whole story?
[02:38:05.778 --> 02:38:06.659]  Fine, I'll just give it to you.
[02:38:06.659 --> 02:38:08.780]  They asked me to do a nighttime show.
[02:38:08.780 --> 02:38:12.282]  They said, your show has become the most popular on the little network.
[02:38:12.282 --> 02:38:16.504]  You've got more listeners than all the other shows combined.
[02:38:16.504 --> 02:38:17.385]  You're this workhorse.
[02:38:17.385 --> 02:38:20.046]  Would you like to not just do three hours during the day?
[02:38:20.046 --> 02:38:21.507]  Would you like to do three hours at night?
[02:38:22.975 --> 02:38:25.937]  And I was young and went behind the ears, and they weren't doing it to be mean.
[02:38:25.937 --> 02:38:34.263]  They were doing it because... And so they put me on at night and made the other host that was on then get mad and think it was some conspiracy with me or something.
[02:38:34.263 --> 02:38:35.664]  And that wasn't Bill, that was somebody else.
[02:38:35.664 --> 02:38:36.685]  I forget who.
[02:38:36.685 --> 02:38:37.285]  Who was that?
[02:38:37.285 --> 02:38:40.428]  What's his name?
[02:38:40.428 --> 02:38:41.088]  It doesn't matter.
[02:38:41.088 --> 02:38:41.789]  I just came to you.
[02:38:41.789 --> 02:38:43.470]  What's the point?
[02:38:43.470 --> 02:38:46.352]  And so I'm doing a show there.
[02:38:46.352 --> 02:38:47.433]  They didn't take that guy off either.
[02:38:47.433 --> 02:38:49.374]  They just ran me up against him.
[02:38:49.374 --> 02:38:50.575]  Because I had listeners.
[02:38:50.575 --> 02:38:52.036]  People wanted to hear me for some reason.
[02:38:52.893 --> 02:38:55.134]  Believe me, I haven't figured... I cannot listen to myself, actually.
[02:38:55.134 --> 02:38:55.794]  It's pure torture.
[02:38:55.794 --> 02:38:58.075]  I don't know why you listen, but... All the info's good.
[02:38:58.075 --> 02:39:01.896]  I know my info's good, but... Yeah, I guess you put up with the stuff I can't stand to listen to.
[02:39:01.896 --> 02:39:04.196]  Just to get it.
[02:39:04.196 --> 02:39:05.017]  Which I appreciate.
[02:39:05.017 --> 02:39:06.797]  Don't think I'm on some high horse here, folks.
[02:39:06.797 --> 02:39:08.698]  Believe me, I just want to go fishing with a cane pole.
[02:39:08.698 --> 02:39:12.459]  I mean, I just... Believe me, this is not my cup of tea.
[02:39:12.459 --> 02:39:18.300]  Um... And Matt Cooper goes ape.
[02:39:18.300 --> 02:39:20.241]  They put me on up against him at night.
[02:39:22.006 --> 02:39:24.427]  And he just goes ape.
[02:39:24.427 --> 02:39:28.829]  And he did some really unfair, dishonest hit pieces on me in 2000.
[02:39:28.829 --> 02:39:37.031]  But by then, I mean, his good friends that knew him would call me and go, yeah, I called up, or went by and he yelled and screamed at me, and he just lost it.
[02:39:37.031 --> 02:39:37.852]  But that's okay.
[02:39:37.852 --> 02:39:43.114]  People get crotchety and mean and grumpy when their family's gone and they're getting threats and all this stuff.
[02:39:43.114 --> 02:39:45.575]  I mean, even before that, he sent out some alert in 98.
[02:39:45.575 --> 02:39:49.336]  I need help, I'm surrounded by the feds, and the IRS is coming to get me.
[02:39:50.251 --> 02:39:51.912]  I need help, so I called Cooper up.
[02:39:51.912 --> 02:39:53.653]  I was on KJFK's Saturday show.
[02:39:53.653 --> 02:39:56.915]  I was doing the weekday show by then, too, but it was a Saturday show.
[02:39:56.915 --> 02:39:58.296]  A lot of you probably heard it.
[02:39:58.296 --> 02:40:03.080]  And I called Cooper up, and I said, uh, I said, Bill, I want to help you.
[02:40:03.080 --> 02:40:04.100]  And he smart-mouthed me.
[02:40:04.100 --> 02:40:07.362]  You're that young idiot full of baloney.
[02:40:07.362 --> 02:40:09.204]  And I said, well, yes, sir.
[02:40:09.204 --> 02:40:10.264]  But you say you need help.
[02:40:10.264 --> 02:40:12.426]  I'd like to have you on, get you some donations.
[02:40:12.426 --> 02:40:14.127]  That's how I've always been.
[02:40:14.127 --> 02:40:15.167]  Nowadays, I'm not like that.
[02:40:15.167 --> 02:40:16.408]  People give me lip or something.
[02:40:16.408 --> 02:40:17.289]  I just don't have time for them.
[02:40:17.907 --> 02:40:20.668]  People in this movement and stuff try to play mind games with me.
[02:40:20.668 --> 02:40:22.708]  I just go, fine, go do your own thing.
[02:40:22.708 --> 02:40:26.429]  Then they squeal and cry and flop around and never look in the mirror.
[02:40:26.429 --> 02:40:31.731]  But I call him up and he gets real rude with me and he goes, alright, I'll come on.
[02:40:31.731 --> 02:40:37.532]  So he comes on the air and about five minutes in he goes, my show's real.
[02:40:37.532 --> 02:40:41.253]  It's not all the beep, beep, beep that yours is.
[02:40:41.253 --> 02:40:45.494]  And I hit the little delay, delay and he keeps doing it and I go, Bill, I'm going to have to let you go.
[02:40:45.494 --> 02:40:47.075]  And he goes, fine, let me go.
[02:40:49.614 --> 02:40:51.716]  You sound like you've had a few toddies.
[02:40:51.716 --> 02:40:54.117]  So you call in, and again, people say, you've got to answer this.
[02:40:54.117 --> 02:40:55.318]  I've answered it for you.
[02:40:55.318 --> 02:40:57.219]  It'll be answered again, or you never answered it.
[02:40:57.219 --> 02:40:58.160]  That's the thing about the Internet.
[02:40:58.160 --> 02:41:01.562]  It just keeps going.
[02:41:01.562 --> 02:41:06.766]  And that was sad to me, because I liked seeing some of his lectures on video I had.
[02:41:06.766 --> 02:41:08.928]  I played a lot of them on AXS TV here locally.
[02:41:08.928 --> 02:41:10.309]  I'd said, Bill Cooper's a good guy.
[02:41:10.309 --> 02:41:14.191]  I mean, I'm here to build people up, not tear them down.
[02:41:14.191 --> 02:41:16.473]  But everybody I talked to said Bill was kind of unraveling.
[02:41:18.903 --> 02:41:21.084]  And then they just, they killed him.
[02:41:21.084 --> 02:41:25.947]  Right after 9-11, they just went out to his house and gunned him down.
[02:41:25.947 --> 02:41:30.930]  And, uh, he played right into their hands, though, isolating himself.
[02:41:30.930 --> 02:41:36.213]  You know, I mean, if the feds are out in front waving guns around, I'm not gonna, or the local police, I'm not gonna run out and engage them.
[02:41:36.213 --> 02:41:38.375]  And I understand, he was just sick of it.
[02:41:38.375 --> 02:41:40.676]  And this stuff gets to you, folks.
[02:41:40.676 --> 02:41:44.979]  I mean, I've had friends of mine who were in this movement for 5, 10, one of them 15 years.
[02:41:44.979 --> 02:41:47.340]  There was an old-timer here that taught me a lot here in Austin.
[02:41:48.494 --> 02:41:53.496]  And he just went completely crazy one day.
[02:41:53.496 --> 02:41:55.017]  I mean, he went nuts.
[02:41:55.017 --> 02:41:55.897]  He had a breakdown.
[02:41:55.897 --> 02:41:58.458]  I mean, it will make you have a breakdown, folks.
[02:41:58.458 --> 02:42:02.239]  To find out that everything's a lie and there's killers running things.
[02:42:02.239 --> 02:42:07.561]  A lot of people who are scared, too, can't live in a constant state of fear.
[02:42:07.561 --> 02:42:14.264]  Knowing the New World Order can come get them.
[02:42:14.264 --> 02:42:14.684]  And, uh...
[02:42:17.609 --> 02:42:20.710]  So, here I've learned a bunch of time that didn't matter and I had a bunch of calls.
[02:42:20.710 --> 02:42:24.612]  So I've answered your question.
[02:42:24.612 --> 02:42:31.435]  And so what happens is you've got fans of William Cooper who like him.
[02:42:31.435 --> 02:42:33.196]  And I like him too.
[02:42:33.196 --> 02:42:35.157]  And so they go hear a few old recordings and stuff.
[02:42:35.157 --> 02:42:37.778]  I mean, here's what Cooper did.
[02:42:37.778 --> 02:42:39.899]  It's pretty funny.
[02:42:39.899 --> 02:42:43.300]  He did some recording where he said, there's Alex Jones.
[02:42:43.300 --> 02:42:45.421]  He's taking, you know, he's getting the nomination.
[02:42:45.421 --> 02:42:46.762]  He's taking the podium.
[02:42:47.330 --> 02:42:48.291]  Yes, it's Alex Jones.
[02:42:48.291 --> 02:42:50.933]  He's won the BSer Award of the Century.
[02:42:50.933 --> 02:42:52.495]  Oh, my.
[02:42:52.495 --> 02:42:57.499]  He's wearing beautiful... I can't even say it.
[02:42:57.499 --> 02:43:07.287]  He said I was wearing ruby... You know, what hangs from your breast.
[02:43:07.287 --> 02:43:07.868]  Bobbles.
[02:43:09.116 --> 02:43:10.337]  This is ridiculous.
[02:43:10.337 --> 02:43:12.898]  I mean, he had a really entertaining show.
[02:43:12.898 --> 02:43:15.339]  My show's not so much entertainment like him.
[02:43:15.339 --> 02:43:18.300]  And what he did, that was very, very dishonest and very, very, very bad.
[02:43:18.300 --> 02:43:23.422]  He took, because of whatever reason, jealousy probably.
[02:43:23.422 --> 02:43:25.723]  See, I'm not in this for that, so that stuff doesn't affect me.
[02:43:25.723 --> 02:43:32.305]  I actually don't like it.
[02:43:32.305 --> 02:43:35.787]  He took like eight hours of broadcast and edited them together on a computer.
[02:43:41.019 --> 02:43:44.601]  I've told this story many times.
[02:43:44.601 --> 02:43:46.662]  And those recordings of that day are out on the web of my show.
[02:43:46.662 --> 02:43:49.783]  People went and heard it and were disgusted with Bill for doing it.
[02:43:49.783 --> 02:43:54.006]  But ABC News announced a missile had been fired from Russia.
[02:43:54.006 --> 02:43:55.226]  And a caller called in.
[02:43:55.226 --> 02:43:59.128]  It was December 31st, 1999.
[02:43:59.128 --> 02:44:03.310]  About to roll over into the new millennium.
[02:44:03.310 --> 02:44:05.331]  Wasn't really, but that's 2001.
[02:44:05.331 --> 02:44:07.312]  But they told you, so I guess it was.
[02:44:07.312 --> 02:44:08.793]  We went along with that delusion.
[02:44:09.671 --> 02:44:11.814]  And, uh, we're like, everything's fine.
[02:44:11.814 --> 02:44:13.597]  Nothing big or bad happened the last few months.
[02:44:13.597 --> 02:44:14.558]  I figured out it was a scam.
[02:44:14.558 --> 02:44:18.624]  I was saying I didn't think anything would happen.
[02:44:18.624 --> 02:44:22.129]  And, uh, so I did that.
[02:44:23.576 --> 02:44:27.758]  And then I did Michael Trudeau's show next, and then I did the next show, and I did the next show.
[02:44:27.758 --> 02:44:28.779]  I'd come in with news.
[02:44:28.779 --> 02:44:31.461]  But I was on my own show, or I think Trudeau's show had started.
[02:44:31.461 --> 02:44:33.862]  And a caller calls in and says, they just announced a missile's been fired.
[02:44:33.862 --> 02:44:35.903]  And I said, oh, go to music.
[02:44:35.903 --> 02:44:37.024]  I'll go see if that's true.
[02:44:37.024 --> 02:44:39.005]  And the TV's on in the other room.
[02:44:39.005 --> 02:44:41.466]  Flip over to ABC.
[02:44:41.466 --> 02:44:43.247]  And they're saying, yeah, a missile's been fired.
[02:44:43.247 --> 02:44:45.469]  We're going to check on it.
[02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:48.370]  And they said, oh, no, because the Russians were at NORAD.
[02:44:48.370 --> 02:44:51.012]  They said it was only a Scud in Chechnya.
[02:44:51.012 --> 02:44:51.772]  I walked back in.
[02:44:51.772 --> 02:44:52.613]  I said, no problem.
[02:44:54.901 --> 02:44:59.748]  And then Trudeau jokes around, oh, the missile's been fired, we're all dead, and we laugh, going, no, no, no, folks, it's nothing.
[02:44:59.748 --> 02:45:00.690]  Well, Cooper didn't.
[02:45:00.690 --> 02:45:02.933]  He took that and he edited that together.
[02:45:02.933 --> 02:45:08.341]  With me in an hour before going, you know, AP reporting, a nuclear power plant is having problems.
[02:45:08.341 --> 02:45:10.705]  And he snipped together like eight hours of stuff.
[02:45:11.405 --> 02:45:23.330]  To make it sound like I was saying Russians had fired missiles out of nowhere, and get ready for total death, and we're all dead, and I did this as an Orson Welles, War of the Worlds, and it was all done.
[02:45:23.330 --> 02:45:26.372]  And all he did was give me his entire audience.
[02:45:26.372 --> 02:45:27.212]  That's another thing.
[02:45:27.212 --> 02:45:29.453]  Whenever people attack me, I don't ever respond back.
[02:45:29.453 --> 02:45:33.195]  In fact, I haven't even talked about Fox News attacking Ron Paul in my name.
[02:45:33.195 --> 02:45:36.276]  Most people will just relish, oh, they're talking about me.
[02:45:36.276 --> 02:45:39.798]  Oh, let's hear the clip.
[02:45:39.798 --> 02:45:40.138]  But I mean,
[02:45:40.953 --> 02:45:44.994]  It's up on PrisonPlanet.com if you want to see it.
[02:45:44.994 --> 02:45:48.015]  Well, I mean, what is even the point?
[02:45:48.015 --> 02:45:48.815]  I said I'd play it.
[02:45:48.815 --> 02:45:49.455]  Maybe we should.
[02:45:49.455 --> 02:46:02.058]  Hey, John, maybe in the last segment, I know it's in two different parts, or can you find it and cue it up where they just start talking about Ron Paul coming on my show and then they go to a commercial and come back and just, I mean, all together that's about a minute and a half.
[02:46:02.058 --> 02:46:05.198]  Can you cue that up, those two together?
[02:46:05.198 --> 02:46:07.959]  Just the end of the first clip and maybe the first or the second clip.
[02:46:07.959 --> 02:46:08.779]  I don't know how you have it.
[02:46:10.078 --> 02:46:16.022]  Uh, I promised I'd do that, and I've forgotten now, and I said I had all this other news, but... Caller calls up with this thing.
[02:46:16.022 --> 02:46:17.302]  Uh, who's the caller that disagreed?
[02:46:17.302 --> 02:46:20.444]  You just told me somebody disagrees.
[02:46:20.444 --> 02:46:22.265]  Okay, I gotta skip everybody and go to him.
[02:46:22.265 --> 02:46:23.106]  Howland, Florida.
[02:46:23.106 --> 02:46:26.007]  Go ahead.
[02:46:26.007 --> 02:46:26.988]  Are you there, Alex?
[02:46:26.988 --> 02:46:27.668]  Yes, Lordship.
[02:46:27.668 --> 02:46:28.849]  Go ahead.
[02:46:28.849 --> 02:46:29.769]  Okay, Alex.
[02:46:29.769 --> 02:46:31.810]  Uh, here's... here's what I disagree on.
[02:46:31.810 --> 02:46:34.752]  Uh, you used the word brain-dead a little bit ago.
[02:46:34.752 --> 02:46:37.914]  Uh, about people being brain-dead.
[02:46:39.170 --> 02:46:41.071]  I don't think that's the problem.
[02:46:41.071 --> 02:46:45.534]  I think the problem is not so much brain dead... They're hypnotized!
[02:46:45.534 --> 02:46:46.014]  Are you there?
[02:46:46.014 --> 02:46:47.515]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:46:47.515 --> 02:46:53.778]  I think the problem is not so much being brain dead, but brainwashed from day one.
[02:46:53.778 --> 02:46:56.780]  And I'll give you an example of what I mean.
[02:46:56.780 --> 02:47:06.806]  Our people, from the time they were kids, were taught, you know, there's a Santa Claus, Easter Bunny, Mother Goose, Tooth Fairy, Alice in Wonderland,
[02:47:07.438 --> 02:47:13.281]  Alex, excuse me, Alice in Wonderland and all that kind of stuff.
[02:47:13.281 --> 02:47:22.286]  But most of this stuff boils down to two things, truth or lies, good or evil.
[02:47:22.286 --> 02:47:28.249]  Not so much brain dead, but just being totally brainwashed all the way.
[02:47:28.249 --> 02:47:36.473]  And I think everything in your program from the people that's been talking to you have pretty much verified in what they were saying.
[02:47:36.977 --> 02:47:39.258]  But maybe just didn't realize it.
[02:47:39.258 --> 02:47:39.818]  No, I agree.
[02:47:39.818 --> 02:47:46.102]  I mean, I use the term brain dead and brain dead would mean they were dead or that their brain wasn't functioning at a higher level.
[02:47:46.102 --> 02:47:46.922]  No, no, I agree.
[02:47:46.922 --> 02:47:47.923]  It is brainwashing.
[02:47:47.923 --> 02:47:50.324]  It is conditioning.
[02:47:50.324 --> 02:47:51.204]  Right.
[02:47:51.204 --> 02:47:59.168]  In other words, you got things like credit cards or real money or Federal Reserve, for instance.
[02:47:59.168 --> 02:48:06.272]  You got all sorts of things that are actually contradictory and
[02:48:07.800 --> 02:48:13.642]  The idea being that one is what you've been taught and one is what is real.
[02:48:13.642 --> 02:48:14.162]  No, you're right.
[02:48:14.162 --> 02:48:15.442]  We're living in a fantasy land.
[02:48:15.442 --> 02:48:17.403]  No, we're living in a fantasy land.
[02:48:17.403 --> 02:48:18.483]  That's exactly it.
[02:48:18.483 --> 02:48:27.566]  But let me get your take on Bush now signing PDD 51 and openly saying he's above the Congress and literal God Emperor.
[02:48:27.566 --> 02:48:29.407]  Well, it's just like the whole government.
[02:48:29.407 --> 02:48:32.048]  Is the government by the people or is it a lie?
[02:48:33.598 --> 02:48:34.638]  You see what I mean?
[02:48:34.638 --> 02:48:41.320]  It's easy to understand once you make the difference between truth and lies, good and evil.
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:49.083]  Well, I agree, and I think in a way this is good that they're being out in the open, because now they're out in the open about it.
[02:48:49.083 --> 02:48:51.204]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:48:51.204 --> 02:49:02.027]  And that's what people need to be... I'll tell you, I use the term un-brainwashed, and I think that's what you're doing.
[02:49:02.958 --> 02:49:21.707]  But there is a big difference between being brain dead and brainwashed, and I think brainwashed from day one is the real problem, and you're the man to make that difference as far as explaining that.
[02:49:21.707 --> 02:49:22.987]  I'm not the one to explain it.
[02:49:22.987 --> 02:49:27.029]  Oh, you're very eloquent, sir, and we appreciate your call, Hal.
[02:49:27.029 --> 02:49:31.231]  I'm going to try to cram, what is it, Steve and Will and Skip.
[02:49:31.860 --> 02:49:32.701]  A few more calls in.
[02:49:32.701 --> 02:49:34.883]  I want to play a little clip of this Ron Paul.
[02:49:34.883 --> 02:49:36.865]  I may not.
[02:49:36.865 --> 02:49:42.030]  I just hope you go to InfoWars.com and get TerrorStorm Final Edition that's out now and make copies of it.
[02:49:42.030 --> 02:49:47.055]  Because this exposes how these murderers killed people on 9-11 and 7-7 and how they're getting ready to do it again.
[02:49:52.322 --> 02:49:55.847]  It's here, after a year in production and traveling to distant lands.
[02:49:55.847 --> 02:49:58.149]  My new film Terror Storm is complete.
[02:49:58.149 --> 02:50:05.799]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[02:50:06.477 --> 02:50:13.919]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[02:50:13.919 --> 02:50:25.662]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, a White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[02:50:25.662 --> 02:50:29.623]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[02:50:29.623 --> 02:50:31.883]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[02:50:31.883 --> 02:50:35.664]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[02:50:50.628 --> 02:50:51.988]  The war on terrorism.
[02:50:51.988 --> 02:50:55.049]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:50:55.049 --> 02:50:59.630]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:50:59.630 --> 02:51:00.771]  So what do you do?
[02:51:00.771 --> 02:51:05.332]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:51:05.812 --> 02:51:08.434]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:51:08.434 --> 02:51:23.186]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:51:23.186 --> 02:51:30.252]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:51:49.545 --> 02:51:54.335]  The Digestive Tract, a natural waste factory built within all of our bodies.
[02:51:54.335 --> 02:51:59.745]  Roughly 25 feet of tunnels designed to absorb nutrition and then dispel the waste.
[02:51:59.745 --> 02:52:01.609]  But what happens when the waste gets clogged up?
[02:52:02.339 --> 02:52:09.808]  More than 4 million Americans have frequent constipation, accounting for 2.5 million physician visits a year.
[02:52:09.808 --> 02:52:15.074]  Now there's AlloCleanse, an all-natural formula based on herbs and safe enzymes.
[02:52:15.074 --> 02:52:20.640]  AlloCleanse gently sweeps the entire digestive tract and supports comfortable regular bathroom habits.
[02:52:20.640 --> 02:52:21.081]  You'll feel

[02:52:32.752 --> 02:52:33.312]  That's 1-800-890-3525.
[02:52:50.598 --> 02:52:54.580]  I'm going to move on because I've got healthcare, immigration, and other stuff that people want to know about.
[02:52:54.580 --> 02:52:59.782]  Regarding the conspiracy theory behind 9-11, I know that you do not believe that there was a conspiracy theory.
[02:52:59.782 --> 02:53:04.804]  However, you know this guy sort of supports that idea.
[02:53:04.804 --> 02:53:10.187]  So then why would you associate yourself with this kind of guy, considering your reputation as a presidential hopeful?
[02:53:11.324 --> 02:53:18.371]  Just thinking what it would be like if I could only go on the TV stations, the major TV networks, when I knew they agreed with me on all of them.
[02:53:18.371 --> 02:53:20.452]  All the major networks agreed with the war.
[02:53:20.452 --> 02:53:23.335]  That meant I could never be on any major TV network.
[02:53:23.335 --> 02:53:28.560]  Of course I don't support everything he says, but people that I associate with, I don't endorse their views.
[02:53:28.560 --> 02:53:32.303]  They come and associate with me to endorse my views, or I'm just expressing my views.
[02:53:32.663 --> 02:53:40.685]  But there'd be no way I could be on television if I had, if that was the litmus test that I had to agree with everything that they stood for and what they promoted.
[02:53:40.685 --> 02:53:41.885]  It just wouldn't work.
[02:53:41.885 --> 02:53:43.726]  All right, let's go on to the next email.
[02:53:43.726 --> 02:53:47.047]  Demetria Sumner from Garland, Texas.
[02:53:47.047 --> 02:53:52.528]  There's a whole other segment before where they're, this evil Alex Jones, evil.
[02:53:52.528 --> 02:53:55.689]  Oh, he's so horrible.
[02:53:55.689 --> 02:53:58.370]  Let's go ahead and talk to Alex in New York.
[02:53:58.370 --> 02:53:58.830]  Go ahead, Alex.
[02:54:01.286 --> 02:54:02.547]  He's gone, Steve, in Florida.
[02:54:02.547 --> 02:54:03.027]  You're on the air.
[02:54:03.027 --> 02:54:05.049]  Go ahead.
[02:54:05.049 --> 02:54:07.811]  You're not the only one who thinks you live in a fruitcake world.
[02:54:07.811 --> 02:54:15.196]  When I wake up and read your site and talk to people that I perceive as intelligent, I think I'm living in the twilight zone, too.
[02:54:15.196 --> 02:54:16.717]  But here's my point.
[02:54:16.717 --> 02:54:24.362]  You know, if you look at the Rockefellers and the robber barons over the years, decades, they've had a plan that covers many decades.
[02:54:24.921 --> 02:54:29.522]  And I've been associated with many different organizations, tax honesty organizations, so on and so forth.
[02:54:29.522 --> 02:54:31.423]  I've fought the IRS for years.
[02:54:31.423 --> 02:54:49.548]  And one thing I've noticed that is missing amongst all of us is a plan that spans more than just the day or just the time you make a movie or just, you know, whatever specific duty or project we're working on.
[02:54:49.548 --> 02:54:51.088]  If we had a plan that spanned
[02:54:51.796 --> 02:55:01.402]  Over a period of time, and dealt with the obstacles, maybe we could change the younger generations that are now going through school now, going through elementary.
[02:55:01.402 --> 02:55:10.867]  Yeah, but that takes a big, giant organization, and I appreciate your call, and that's easily infiltratable and controllable, and sometimes I'll get into, do a whole hour on that subject.
[02:55:10.867 --> 02:55:15.210]  Let's go ahead and talk to, who's up next here, instead of this craziness?
[02:55:15.210 --> 02:55:16.811]  Will and Philly, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:55:19.690 --> 02:55:21.030]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[02:55:21.030 --> 02:55:22.291]  Yes, go ahead.
[02:55:22.291 --> 02:55:24.792]  Yes, I just got to commend you, man.
[02:55:24.792 --> 02:55:26.912]  You are the glue that holds this thing together.
[02:55:26.912 --> 02:55:31.174]  You introduced everybody to Bowman, Christensen, Griffin, McGovern.
[02:55:31.174 --> 02:55:33.854]  You can have all the experts you want on.
[02:55:33.854 --> 02:55:36.735]  There's one key, man, and it's the family members.
[02:55:36.735 --> 02:55:38.196]  They're the catalyst.
[02:55:38.196 --> 02:55:39.856]  We have them on our side.
[02:55:39.856 --> 02:55:45.258]  We have to grab them and harness them because
[02:55:46.098 --> 02:55:47.719]  That's what's going to wake the people up.
[02:55:47.719 --> 02:55:49.860]  You're talking about victims, family members of 9-11?
[02:55:49.860 --> 02:55:51.961]  The victims' family members.
[02:55:51.961 --> 02:55:55.683]  I mean, we have Sally Reganhardt.
[02:55:55.683 --> 02:56:03.647]  She says, I think we have to look at these alternative groups and these alternative people who are continuing to make films and bring their research to the public.
[02:56:03.647 --> 02:56:04.087]  I hear you.
[02:56:04.087 --> 02:56:05.208]  We're out of time.
[02:56:05.208 --> 02:56:09.390]  And on the Ron Paul situation, 82% of Americans in a major poll
[02:56:10.077 --> 02:56:13.399]  This scientific poll believes they're being lied to about 9-11.
[02:56:13.399 --> 02:56:15.140]  68% believe inside job.
[02:56:15.140 --> 02:56:18.221]  We are the majority and we have the science and the fact.
[02:56:18.221 --> 02:56:21.223]  Fox News is about controlling thought.
[02:56:21.223 --> 02:56:22.624]  CNN's about controlling thought.
[02:56:22.624 --> 02:56:25.345]  Keeping you on that mental reservation.
[02:56:25.345 --> 02:56:27.226]  Our government wrote Operation Northwoods.
[02:56:27.893 --> 02:56:33.737]  They should be the first suspects for 9-11 right there, because it's not our government, it's a criminal group.
[02:56:33.737 --> 02:56:36.599]  The Israelis admit that they have fake Al-Qaeda groups.
[02:56:36.599 --> 02:56:44.383]  The Israelis admit that they staged the 76 deal with Idi Amin in Uganda, at the airport.
[02:56:44.383 --> 02:56:47.005]  That's now not me, that's Israel admitting it.
[02:56:47.005 --> 02:56:51.408]  Governments tend to be, they're always the number one culprit.
[02:56:51.408 --> 02:56:54.330]  Statistically, it's them eight times out of ten.
[02:56:54.330 --> 02:56:55.250]  Are there real terrorists?
[02:56:55.250 --> 02:56:56.191]  Yeah, there's a few out there.
[02:56:57.374 --> 02:56:58.415]  I'm sorry to skip another.
[02:56:58.415 --> 02:57:00.695]  We don't have time to get to you.
[02:57:00.695 --> 02:57:02.996]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight central, here on the network.
[02:57:02.996 --> 02:57:04.237]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2, live.
