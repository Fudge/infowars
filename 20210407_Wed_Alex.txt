[05:05.760 --> 05:10.960]  challenge first of all let me say I love your products I am a granny and for
[05:10.960 --> 05:14.840]  all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in the sun
[05:14.840 --> 05:19.920]  like me I was loaded up with sunspots or age spots as they're lovingly called but
[05:19.920 --> 05:24.400]  since taking your x2 for the last couple of years my skin is just really
[05:24.400 --> 05:30.480]  gorgeous actually people think I'm 55 years old and I was already taking your
[05:30.480 --> 05:34.200]  other supplements but I thought you know well maybe that's what I need to do
[05:34.200 --> 05:37.600]  because I just thought it was a hopeless situation but when I started
[05:37.600 --> 05:42.240]  taking it me doesn't happen immediately but you know over a period of time I
[05:42.240 --> 05:46.600]  started noticing okay you know this is a ticket this is working this is
[05:46.600 --> 05:51.960]  wonderful you know I don't I don't have to put on derma blend anymore you know so
[05:51.960 --> 06:14.200]  anyway it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[06:14.200 --> 06:30.120]  it's for wars tomorrow's news today
[06:30.120 --> 06:36.720]  I don't care what you think about this guy who I'm about to mention but I was
[06:36.720 --> 06:43.000]  sent a a video yesterday I said it's basically a documentary and late in the
[06:43.000 --> 06:48.640]  afternoon so I watched it last night and it's and it's by Alex Jones info wars
[06:48.640 --> 06:54.560]  and and the media has tarnished him with all sorts of name-calling conspiracy
[06:54.560 --> 06:58.720]  theorists bomb thrower the one thing that I know about this gentleman Alex
[06:58.720 --> 07:05.080]  Jones is that is that he loves this country he is as smart as a whip he he
[07:05.080 --> 07:11.240]  absolutely believes in what he believes in and he also does his research and his
[07:11.240 --> 07:16.200]  homework and so I sat because a close friend of mine said you've got to watch
[07:16.200 --> 07:20.680]  this I just finished watching it he actually put it out yesterday and it's
[07:20.680 --> 07:24.320]  called an emergency broadcast and it's based on info wars and it's based on the
[07:24.320 --> 07:30.440]  whole COVID lie and and Alex takes his audience through an hour and a half
[07:30.440 --> 07:37.200]  worth of just incredible level of detail of a of a war game that our
[07:37.200 --> 07:43.360]  government did back in the 2016 2017 time frame with with you know under a
[07:43.360 --> 07:48.680]  different name and they called it spars instead of SARS COVID right and it's
[07:48.680 --> 07:54.960]  this incredible I mean it's like it's like runs parallel to everything that's
[07:54.960 --> 08:00.920]  going on today even in the war game that they did almost five years ago now
[08:00.920 --> 08:06.000]  four years ago now in the war game they even put out social media things like
[08:06.000 --> 08:11.240]  tweets and such and in the tweets that they use in the war game they use the
[08:11.240 --> 08:16.520]  exact same tweets over the last year I mean exact same words the exact same
[08:16.520 --> 08:21.720]  hashtags and it's like it's one big setup so let me so that's just this thing
[08:21.720 --> 08:26.160]  that this thing that Alex Jones put out yesterday it needs to get out in a bigger
[08:26.160 --> 08:31.320]  way because Alex walks through and again whatever I don't care what people
[08:31.320 --> 08:36.280]  think of him he's incredibly detailed in his research he loves this country he
[08:36.280 --> 08:40.760]  is a patriot and he's somebody who we better listen to or others in this
[08:40.760 --> 08:45.160]  country better listen to and there's a reason why the mainstream media calls
[08:45.160 --> 08:49.040]  the guy like him a bomb thrower or a conspiracy theorist because they're
[08:49.040 --> 08:53.680]  they're in fear of the truth that he does actually bring out and in this
[08:53.680 --> 08:59.000]  particular documentary that he did yesterday it's it's fascinating and it
[08:59.000 --> 09:04.040]  there's an awful awful lot of parallels in it from what was done in a war game
[09:04.040 --> 09:09.800]  so to speak quote-unquote and then what we put the reality is that we're facing
[09:09.800 --> 09:13.680]  well that is the former national security advisor former head of the
[09:13.680 --> 09:19.320]  defense intelligence agency and a true war hero combat veteran endorsing that
[09:19.320 --> 09:24.440]  two-hour report that myself and the great crew put together and it's a two-hour
[09:24.440 --> 09:31.240]  report so I have asked the crew today to edit it down to 30 minutes and to air
[09:31.240 --> 09:35.960]  that in the last 30 minutes of the transmission today I've also asked
[09:35.960 --> 09:40.720]  Owen Schreuer to air it on his show today so that it goes out on our radio
[09:40.720 --> 09:45.560]  affiliates but you can see the two-hour report from last Saturday it seems like
[09:45.560 --> 09:50.880]  six months ago it was only five days ago emergency Saturday broadcast world
[09:50.880 --> 09:58.440]  shocked by spars 2025 2028 document and again they only change a letter or two in
[09:58.440 --> 10:02.640]  the document from what actually happens the exact names they use in the exact
[10:02.640 --> 10:09.600]  scenario so this is beyond a criminal smoking gun and General Flynn would
[10:09.600 --> 10:14.200]  understand how foreign governments and corporations will do drills what it's
[10:14.200 --> 10:18.440]  really a war game it's really a real plan it's an attack scenario but they
[10:18.440 --> 10:23.760]  just call it a war game well what will they call this a war game for viruses
[10:23.760 --> 10:27.080]  but really it's an operational operational manual it's not a war game
[10:27.080 --> 10:31.400]  it's a war plan and so that's the former head of defense intelligence agency
[10:31.400 --> 10:35.800]  that's the defense agency for the military telling you that this is key to
[10:35.800 --> 10:39.560]  watch it's all right there anybody that's educated on things like this looks at
[10:39.560 --> 10:44.840]  this immediately and says oh my god this is horrible this is bone chilling I mean
[10:44.840 --> 10:49.840]  I've been physically nauseous since I started researching it two weeks ago and
[10:49.840 --> 10:56.120]  it just goes on and on and on way worse than lockstep way worse than event 201
[10:56.120 --> 11:03.760]  way worse than crimson contagion which are all parts of this so we're racing to
[11:03.760 --> 11:07.880]  edit down the two hours it'll probably air in the first hour of the war room
[11:07.880 --> 11:13.800]  today and then be posted a nice 30-minute boil down just hitting the
[11:13.800 --> 11:19.120]  documents itself but the full two-hour piece is at Bandai video and I can tell
[11:19.120 --> 11:24.560]  you that the system's gone from being angry at me to wanting me dead now and
[11:24.560 --> 11:29.680]  I'm not saying that to act powerful or to or to oh yeah I mean this is really
[11:29.680 --> 11:33.360]  going on and I'm more than happy to do this because there's no future anyways
[11:33.360 --> 11:40.080]  we don't beat this and General Flynn I can tell you is researching is already
[11:40.080 --> 11:45.120]  been researching the Carnegie Endowment the Rockefeller Foundation that's the
[11:45.120 --> 11:50.680]  core of this globalist group since the 20s that runs it all and so if you read
[11:50.680 --> 11:54.640]  what they write and what they say then you know what they're gonna do and now
[11:54.640 --> 11:59.480]  they don't even thinly avail this anymore and so that's that's why it
[11:59.480 --> 12:03.960]  should be easy to beat this if people will just look at what they're saying
[12:03.960 --> 12:07.920]  what they're doing and you say well why would they let their plans out it's so
[12:07.920 --> 12:10.480]  they're academics and they're higher-level operatives they're just
[12:10.480 --> 12:15.240]  like officers in a military operation so their kernels and lieutenant generals
[12:15.240 --> 12:19.680]  you know and all the rest of it up the up the arc up to you know general and
[12:19.680 --> 12:23.840]  you know globalist field marshal whatever you want to call it these
[12:23.840 --> 12:29.040]  individuals need to know there's a confidence in what they're doing so
[12:29.040 --> 12:33.440]  there are people follow along for morale this is a depopulation operation and so
[12:33.440 --> 12:41.680]  if you go back to Klaus Schwab and the Davos group they all just came out and
[12:41.680 --> 12:47.120]  said in videos on Twitter that isn't it good we locked you down it's saving the
[12:47.120 --> 12:50.400]  earth and we should have locked down to every year every two years and you
[12:50.400 --> 12:53.240]  should never leave your house and apps should control you just humans are bad
[12:53.240 --> 12:57.640]  and we really did this to set up the great reset they write books on it they
[12:57.640 --> 13:02.360]  put out promotional videos and you say oh that's just the Davos group man what
[13:02.360 --> 13:07.440]  they say happens like a engineer or an architect creates a blueprint for a
[13:07.440 --> 13:11.480]  building and then where they say the pillars go in where they say the
[13:11.480 --> 13:16.160]  foundation goes in where they say the walls go in and the light bulbs and the
[13:16.160 --> 13:20.960]  bathrooms and the toilets and and the and the lampshades and the the
[13:20.960 --> 13:25.680]  countertops I mean it's what they say and I'm sitting here watching them build
[13:25.680 --> 13:29.960]  this damn thing it's like going to the store and buying a little model for a
[13:29.960 --> 13:33.440]  race car you're gonna build or a or a b-17 like when I was a kid I love those
[13:33.440 --> 13:37.280]  little military models and you know you got it and you had a map in it you had
[13:37.280 --> 13:40.640]  directions and it said okay first thing put the glue these together then glue
[13:40.640 --> 13:43.880]  that together and you followed it and you got the airplane later look really
[13:43.880 --> 13:48.080]  cool you paint it hanging up your room with the monofilament line you weren't
[13:48.080 --> 13:53.040]  out fishing with it and so you look at this and they tell you this is the plan
[13:53.040 --> 13:56.600]  we're doing it and the average person goes oh that's too complex nobody ever
[13:56.600 --> 14:01.360]  do that but you have all the pieces to put them together it's all there just
[14:01.360 --> 14:05.360]  like Legos and that's why they use compartmentalization on the public
[14:05.360 --> 14:09.240]  where they only see one piece or two pieces or five pieces I see thousands
[14:09.240 --> 14:13.920]  of pieces and we've proven that we know how the pieces go together because I've
[14:13.920 --> 14:16.320]  been studying the globalist so long people go how did you know that was
[14:16.320 --> 14:19.640]  gonna happen well when you study them long enough they're building the same
[14:19.640 --> 14:24.400]  thing and see you learn it's not just a bunch of pieces of the one project once
[14:24.400 --> 14:28.240]  all those pieces build a project you pull back 35,000 feet wait a minute that
[14:28.240 --> 14:31.880]  was all one piece of a larger piece so all these pieces go together and build
[14:31.880 --> 14:36.160]  this piece then you pull back again now these pieces build this piece and then
[14:36.160 --> 14:39.040]  you go read a damn book written by them they admit the whole thing it's not like
[14:39.040 --> 14:42.480]  you're even going God I see that right there I just connected the dots aren't
[14:42.480 --> 14:47.920]  I smart this is in your face the question is do you have the courage like
[14:47.920 --> 14:51.880]  General Flynn has to face it and that's why they're scared of him they're scared
[14:51.880 --> 14:54.360]  of a few other people and believe me it's not a nice position to be in but
[14:54.360 --> 14:58.080]  we're willing to do it he's willing to die so am I we've talked about it and
[14:58.080 --> 15:03.960]  and we believe in you and so here you are you want a military leader to stand
[15:03.960 --> 15:07.200]  up and fight he's doing it and we're doing it here too but this is damn real
[15:07.200 --> 15:12.520]  this isn't a drill this isn't a game this isn't a joke this is America under
[15:12.520 --> 15:16.000]  modern attack we could be a foreign enemy because we know it was an enemy but
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.880]  an enemy that comes a sister award secretly not showing their colors
[15:19.880 --> 15:23.800]  openly is the plague and that's what we face okay I just got back from the
[15:23.800 --> 15:27.080]  border or what's left of it I'm gonna break that down a lot of exclusives
[15:27.080 --> 15:32.680]  there we've got huge COVID takeover forced inoculation global passport ID
[15:32.680 --> 15:36.320]  systems we've got how many guests we have today the crew has just done a
[15:36.320 --> 15:39.600]  superlative job of these great guests they got churches being shut down and
[15:39.600 --> 15:43.560]  Canada with fences being put up around and we've got folks at the church outside
[15:43.560 --> 15:47.360]  the bar bar joining us through Hernandez from the border joins us Max
[15:47.360 --> 15:53.080]  Kaiser joins us Patrick Howley joins us it just goes on and on the biggest
[15:53.080 --> 16:01.200]  news stay with us epic is one of only a handful of domain registrars that
[16:01.200 --> 16:06.120]  promote free speech and freedom of association and they know that big tech
[16:06.120 --> 16:09.920]  is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive
[16:09.920 --> 16:13.200]  censorship and organized crime racketeering that's why they've been
[16:13.200 --> 16:17.200]  massively expanding their services so whether you have domains or want to
[16:17.200 --> 16:20.800]  register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other
[16:20.800 --> 16:25.120]  major service they've got it all and they're expanding and if you go to info
[16:25.120 --> 16:30.280]  wars domains calm and follow that link you get all their services at the lowest
[16:30.280 --> 16:36.160]  price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund
[16:36.160 --> 16:40.520]  the info war and we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of
[16:40.520 --> 16:45.040]  services that you get from them so it's a win-win as we build a true open free
[16:45.040 --> 16:48.400]  internet again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was
[16:48.400 --> 16:54.040]  free so info wars domains calm the revolution starts there info wars
[16:54.040 --> 17:00.640]  domains calm take action now the equation is very simple the mega banks
[17:00.640 --> 17:06.600]  control the media they control big pharma they control academia they control
[17:06.600 --> 17:11.920]  military industrial complex they control big tech and everywhere that they have
[17:11.920 --> 17:16.560]  been in control in the third world they have established absolute total
[17:16.560 --> 17:22.760]  despotism and dehumanization it is the western Christian idea of human freedom
[17:22.760 --> 17:26.840]  that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that
[17:26.840 --> 17:32.240]  actually threatens them so because they can't defeat that empowering ethic they
[17:32.240 --> 17:37.680]  instead co-opted turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually
[17:37.680 --> 17:42.720]  destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of
[17:42.720 --> 17:47.560]  control that's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to
[17:47.560 --> 17:51.560]  defeating them but the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote
[17:51.560 --> 17:55.440]  info wars and hand out video so we double your efforts we're all in this
[17:55.440 --> 17:57.840]  together
[17:57.840 --> 18:18.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[18:18.680 --> 18:22.360]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen of the tip of the spear what's left of the
[18:22.360 --> 18:27.560]  resistance and the twilight of our republic are to believe growing up in
[18:27.560 --> 18:31.280]  every new idea in this position but you're to the show you care you're in
[18:31.280 --> 18:36.280]  the same seat I'm in aware of what's going on what are we gonna do about it
[18:36.280 --> 18:42.240]  well the good news is this is a very authoritarian very destructive very
[18:42.240 --> 18:47.760]  nasty operation and so it's gonna get really bad and things are gonna fall
[18:47.760 --> 18:52.240]  apart and get horrible and so if we simply expose it ahead of time like we've
[18:52.240 --> 18:57.720]  been doing it will form massive opposition and there is massive opposition
[18:57.720 --> 19:00.880]  then gas lights americans and others around the world
[19:00.880 --> 19:05.560]  brazilians folks in the UK being punished from riggs at Germany trying to
[19:05.560 --> 19:08.800]  get out from under the mercil dictatorship to feel like you're all
[19:08.800 --> 19:14.680]  alone and to bankrupt you where you have no job where you have no industry where
[19:14.680 --> 19:17.800]  you're living off a government check so they can dictate the terms of your
[19:17.800 --> 19:23.360]  surrender this is all very simple it has a word in the military this first
[19:23.360 --> 19:28.560]  picked up in hieroglyphs and Sanskrit over six thousand years ago and it's
[19:28.560 --> 19:35.920]  called siege and so they are attempting to induce us into siege where are the
[19:35.920 --> 19:39.240]  areas where they have total siege the big cities doesn't matter if you're in
[19:39.240 --> 19:43.040]  Japan doesn't matter if you're in Berlin doesn't matter if you're in London
[19:43.040 --> 19:46.160]  doesn't matter if you're in Chicago doesn't matter if you're in Austin
[19:46.160 --> 19:50.840]  doesn't matter if you're in Mexico City doesn't matter where you are if you're
[19:50.840 --> 19:55.360]  in a big city and dependent on the system the lockdown never ended and you
[19:55.360 --> 20:00.920]  never have any freedom siege the act or process of surrounding and attacking a
[20:00.920 --> 20:05.520]  fortified place in such a way as to isolate it from help and supplies the
[20:05.520 --> 20:11.000]  purpose of lessening the resistance of the defenders and thereby making
[20:11.000 --> 20:21.160]  capture possible and so knowing is at the battle taking action with historical
[20:21.160 --> 20:26.240]  remedies that you know work is the other enough so I it coined the term
[20:26.240 --> 20:32.160]  resistance is victory and that's true but it's only half the equation resistance
[20:32.160 --> 20:37.160]  is victory if you understand what you're facing and have a historical plan
[20:37.160 --> 20:41.480]  that's gonna work for the people better than what's being done and the enemy then
[20:41.480 --> 20:46.760]  oppresses makes us even stronger but if we don't know we're under attack then
[20:46.760 --> 20:52.040]  the oppression breaks us and brings us down but we will not become weak under
[20:52.040 --> 20:56.240]  this attack we will come together white Hispanic black Asian human with red
[20:56.240 --> 21:01.080]  blood understanding there's an attack and we will win because our spirit is
[21:01.080 --> 21:07.680]  strong and what the enemy is selling is death that's why I'm completely energized
[21:07.680 --> 21:15.360]  today and like Martin Luther King said I have seen the future it's not a vision
[21:15.360 --> 21:18.520]  it's a spirit the Holy Spirit tells you you do the right thing humanity it's
[21:18.520 --> 21:22.080]  gonna come together into amazing things that's the lightning of the Holy Ghost
[21:22.080 --> 21:26.320]  that's the understanding and the enemy oh don't be religious don't be
[21:26.320 --> 21:31.760]  spiritual because they're totally spiritual they're into Satanism so let me
[21:31.760 --> 21:34.400]  tell you I'm this is a shorter segment long segment coming up we got like six
[21:34.400 --> 21:39.040]  minutes to break let me tell you what's coming up today because there is a lot
[21:39.040 --> 21:47.840]  we have incredible COVID hysteria and lies but also the lies are just say the
[21:47.840 --> 21:53.080]  wheels have come off no the wheels came off and the whole thing blew up but they
[21:53.080 --> 21:56.280]  don't care because they think you're stupid but I have this stack I'll cover
[21:56.280 --> 22:06.200]  next segment that is mind blowing of the COVID hoax and just how insane it is
[22:06.200 --> 22:09.320]  and how it's like a snake eating its tail at every level that's the next
[22:09.320 --> 22:14.800]  segment then Drew Hernandez who is even more impressive in person and in the
[22:14.800 --> 22:17.560]  field he was already going down the border he told me a week ago I said well
[22:17.560 --> 22:20.880]  come here we're gonna go down there too so he linked up with him and covered what
[22:20.880 --> 22:25.320]  he was doing he did a lot of reports we didn't do he linked up with us we kept
[22:25.320 --> 22:28.680]  like going places he'd be right there like the force was with us we were kind
[22:28.680 --> 22:33.000]  of in Sopotico linked up and I'd say something and he just finished the
[22:33.000 --> 22:36.320]  sentence and then I he'd say something I finished the sentence I mean you talk
[22:36.320 --> 22:40.840]  about linked up and we just it just absolutely ran the tables on them down
[22:40.840 --> 22:43.960]  there at the border that's collapsed and the police and the border patrol are on
[22:43.960 --> 22:47.320]  our side they're like we understand we know it's horrible we don't know what to
[22:47.320 --> 22:51.200]  do under Trump it was great nothing we shut the border down we were controlling
[22:51.200 --> 22:54.880]  it now it's completely collapsed ten times worse than it was under Obama they
[22:54.880 --> 22:59.160]  said mr. Jones and I met with police chiefs you name it they said mr. Jones
[22:59.160 --> 23:05.800]  it's ten times worse than under Obama and they said it's a million a month we
[23:05.800 --> 23:08.720]  caught a hundred seventy something thousand we're totally overwhelmed and
[23:08.720 --> 23:13.520]  then now the border patrol deputy head came out and said it's a million in just
[23:13.520 --> 23:18.960]  the last couple months so this is just insane that is coming up with Drew
[23:18.960 --> 23:24.320]  Hernandez I mean just look at some of these headlines US considering using
[23:24.320 --> 23:27.960]  NASA facility to house migrant children they already got churches all over Texas
[23:27.960 --> 23:31.520]  doing it they've got sports stadiums doing it I mean ladies and gentlemen you
[23:31.520 --> 23:34.480]  don't have to go to the border to find people there's just lines of walking
[23:34.480 --> 23:37.880]  down the street everywhere these are big cities down there these are big towns
[23:37.880 --> 23:43.880]  and they got like 20-story buildings and you know big airports and malls and
[23:43.880 --> 23:48.920]  restaurants it looks like looks like a major city it is a major city and
[23:48.920 --> 23:53.440]  there's just people everywhere randomly with children no background checks of
[23:53.440 --> 23:57.040]  who they are what's going on they deliver them to these leftist George
[23:57.040 --> 24:01.800]  Soros funded so-called charities on record funded by Soros and they just
[24:01.800 --> 24:08.480]  disappear and by the way I don't even care they'll load three kids into the
[24:08.480 --> 24:12.240]  trunk of a car and closing on them I saw that I said that's illegal shut that
[24:12.240 --> 24:16.080]  down we've been there for a while I'm like they get crammed kids in back those
[24:16.080 --> 24:19.720]  cars and finally it clicked on what that's illegal we'll use a local state
[24:19.720 --> 24:23.600]  law against them even though violating federal law crossing international lines
[24:23.600 --> 24:28.840]  being handed over being crammed the back of cars I mean it was just insane and the
[24:28.840 --> 24:34.280]  police came and we stopped that event so if other yeah that's the NASA facility
[24:34.280 --> 24:39.320]  now being filled up and for TV viewers so for everybody watching this you'd
[24:39.320 --> 24:43.960]  understand if you just go down there I've got a lot of calls for National Talk
[24:43.960 --> 24:48.400]  Show host Ted Nugent didn't mind if he was on record he's on tomorrow and Ted's
[24:48.400 --> 24:52.800]  going down there I'm not gonna say when I'm gonna go with him but that is all in
[24:52.800 --> 24:56.720]  the pipeline right now and some other folks called me and it's just funny that
[24:56.720 --> 25:00.240]  one video because we shot all these other incredible videos and they all you
[25:00.240 --> 25:03.800]  know got 300 400 thousand views but this other one has already gone mega viral I
[25:03.800 --> 25:07.760]  saw one video on TikTok that my daughter sent me this morning with four
[25:07.760 --> 25:13.440]  million views so the left is not having any success suppressing any of this and
[25:13.440 --> 25:17.960]  just all the glory goes to God on that front so we're gonna cover that as well
[25:17.960 --> 25:22.640]  but but they're big push their big takeover the COVID takeover right here
[25:22.640 --> 25:27.440]  on the other side but see the video from the source downloaded as copyright

[27:04.480 --> 27:11.360]  we've done together but I'll tell you this the technocrats are really upping
[27:11.360 --> 27:15.480]  their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media
[27:15.480 --> 27:20.960]  they're trying to shudder and silence human resistance so now is the time to
[27:20.960 --> 27:24.040]  understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate
[27:24.040 --> 27:27.600]  everything you warned your friends and family about it's about to be true so
[27:27.600 --> 27:32.800]  it's now that your credibility is way up the power structure to silence those of
[27:32.800 --> 27:39.360]  us that they can't but it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us we
[27:39.360 --> 27:45.400]  have the power but the Sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech we
[27:45.400 --> 27:49.200]  have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that long dark
[27:49.200 --> 27:54.000]  night doesn't come so be the polar bears you are
[27:55.640 --> 28:03.200]  in the early 1990s it was a really funny movie that came out called wanes world
[28:03.200 --> 28:10.080]  even before I had access to a show in the mid-90s I wouldn't call that movie and
[28:10.080 --> 28:14.600]  thought man that was fun to speak out and have your own ideas and even if
[28:14.600 --> 28:18.160]  you're a nerd you're still entertaining because you're real well what do they
[28:18.160 --> 28:25.720]  say in Wayne's world every day when I cover these huge topics I don't feel
[28:25.720 --> 28:29.120]  worthy to talk to you because these topics are so huge or so real but I'm
[28:29.120 --> 28:32.040]  trying to tell you the truth I'm trying to get it right and most of time we do
[28:32.040 --> 28:36.680]  the globalists love lying to you they love manipulating you they enjoy
[28:36.680 --> 28:41.520]  destroying humanity and enjoy manipulating ideas and using people's
[28:41.520 --> 28:46.440]  ignorance against them that for me is really such a disgusting so you've got
[28:46.440 --> 28:51.560]  to pledge for myself in the hall in Fort Worth crew that we will never join the
[28:51.560 --> 28:54.640]  globalist we will never knowingly manipulate you because we know we're
[28:54.640 --> 29:00.160]  all in this together I knew Trump was in battle I knew he was surrounded by
[29:00.160 --> 29:07.120]  cowards and by double-talking agents of the enemy and a lot of people just
[29:07.120 --> 29:12.560]  couldn't believe it right oh no it's 3d chess 5d chess he's invincible and I
[29:12.560 --> 29:15.240]  understand why people wanted to believe that because this is scary what's going
[29:15.240 --> 29:18.640]  on the global government the New World Order and now that people woke up the
[29:18.640 --> 29:22.240]  fact that's real they won't somebody to come save them from well Trump sure as
[29:22.240 --> 29:26.240]  hell tried my gosh look it out prescription drug prices just tripled
[29:26.240 --> 29:30.640]  quadruple depending on the drug once by the silent executive order we pay the
[29:30.640 --> 29:34.400]  most of anybody in the world that's just one case of hundreds of things the
[29:34.400 --> 29:38.600]  trumpet reversed and now people are gonna feel the sting in the pain energy
[29:38.600 --> 29:42.200]  cost everything else but what's really illustrated this is the trial to the
[29:42.200 --> 29:46.240]  Senate where Trump's own lawyers are attacking him and putting him down and
[29:46.240 --> 29:49.720]  saying he lost the election and just engaged in all sorts of criminal
[29:49.720 --> 29:54.960]  activity because the fixes in folks the swamp is deep Trump fought it but it's
[29:54.960 --> 29:59.480]  up to us to win it the people are awakening they're taking control of
[29:59.480 --> 30:03.680]  their own environment cell phones are an amazing tool really they're a super
[30:03.680 --> 30:08.200]  computer that's handheld but big tech large corporations hackers governments
[30:08.200 --> 30:12.840]  foreign governments the chai comms especially are using this to steal your
[30:12.840 --> 30:17.440]  data to share your data to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up
[30:17.440 --> 30:21.600]  billions of people's data they can actually predict on record what's gonna
[30:21.600 --> 30:27.640]  happen in mass movements cutting them out of that data stream absolutely
[30:27.640 --> 30:32.040]  devastates their AI takeover in their own words they admit it so I've been
[30:32.040 --> 30:35.400]  selling privacy pouches and block it pockets and things like that for more
[30:35.400 --> 30:38.760]  than a decade and now the units have gotten really lightweight their fairer
[30:38.760 --> 30:42.960]  day cages they just look like a cloth envelope they work absolutely great and
[30:42.960 --> 30:47.280]  it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over
[30:47.280 --> 30:50.600]  your identity when you are traveling and don't want big brother to know what
[30:50.600 --> 30:56.680]  you're up to because it's other business get yours at m4store.com today
[30:56.680 --> 31:25.640]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[31:25.640 --> 31:34.200]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones all right so we've
[31:34.200 --> 31:40.080]  already seen the globalist test does and tell us that Bruce Jenner is
[31:40.080 --> 31:43.960]  Caitlyn Jenner has even had his male genitals cut off he still wouldn't be a
[31:43.960 --> 31:48.280]  female and they call him a woman on TV even on Fox News this morning they had
[31:48.280 --> 31:53.320]  Perino up there doing it oh it he'll be our Republican now so we'll get
[31:53.320 --> 31:59.400]  Republicans to vote for some globalist you're selling sex changes for little
[31:59.400 --> 32:07.240]  boys and little girls so that we can defeat the recall of Governor Newsome
[32:07.240 --> 32:12.880]  absolutely disgusting and I see all these national shows oh Jones is
[32:12.880 --> 32:19.280]  transphobic Jones is attacking the undersecretary of the Department of Health
[32:19.280 --> 32:27.880]  and Human Services because it's a woman no it's a man in a wig that looks like a
[32:27.880 --> 32:35.360]  demonic chipmunk that is saying taxpayers should pay for five and six and
[32:35.360 --> 32:42.840]  seven-year-olds to surgically have their testicles and penises cut off and
[32:42.840 --> 32:47.440]  people are like hey don't say that on air yeah I hear it it's all obscene what
[32:47.440 --> 32:50.200]  you think cutting there I mean I'm against the Muslims cutting little girls
[32:50.200 --> 32:53.640]  stuff off I think children should have the choice before they have
[32:53.640 --> 32:58.360]  circumcisions people say what about circumcisions yeah I got one my parents
[32:58.360 --> 33:03.360]  didn't mean bad but people should not do that but the circumcision is on a
[33:03.360 --> 33:08.840]  scale of one to ten like a two and the Muslims cutting the little girls
[33:08.840 --> 33:16.240]  quatoruses off is about a four and cut the boys testicles off and cutting his
[33:16.240 --> 33:22.160]  Johnson off is a 10 it's the same thing as a hysterectomy it's the same thing is
[33:22.160 --> 33:26.560]  going into a woman and cutting her uterus and ovaries out it's a hundred
[33:26.560 --> 33:33.560]  percent so my Johnson got a two and I'm not complaining about it I'm here saying
[33:33.560 --> 33:36.880]  I should have made that choice I don't know what it'd be like having that but
[33:36.880 --> 33:41.360]  I'm not a victim I don't blame my parents but okay I got hit with a two I got
[33:41.360 --> 33:49.600]  sexually mutilated when I was born the Muslims cut a large portion off that's
[33:49.600 --> 33:55.000]  a four I'm not judging them they should stop it so I'm down here to two up here
[33:55.000 --> 33:59.640]  to four cutting the whole damn thing off and taking the balls off it's a freaking
[33:59.640 --> 34:07.840]  10 and then you got some freak with a damn curly hair looking like a but like
[34:07.840 --> 34:16.000]  he's in a Rob Zombie movie or like he's on a chainsaw massacre and all these
[34:16.000 --> 34:21.360]  people always a demon outfits people have sex with Satan now Saturday night
[34:21.360 --> 34:28.200]  live had God having sex with the rapper these are a bunch of crazy people under
[34:28.200 --> 34:32.800]  demonic control and they want access to our children so listen Bruce Jenner
[34:32.800 --> 34:40.680]  burning hell you demon if you're 18 years old and you want to go in your
[34:40.680 --> 34:44.400]  garage and turn your lawn mower up and turn its blades on and stick your
[34:44.400 --> 34:51.280]  genitals in that that's your business you should go to a mental institution but
[34:51.280 --> 34:56.040]  I shouldn't have to pay for having now the military is gonna pay to have people's
[34:56.040 --> 34:59.760]  women because these women want to say they're men they're women are having
[34:59.760 --> 35:04.080]  their ovaries cut out this is freak azoid man
[35:06.680 --> 35:12.240]  yeah there's mainstream news Satanism sounds pretty great so they just want
[35:12.240 --> 35:16.080]  you to turn your life force off and turn off what's common sense so they can run
[35:16.080 --> 35:24.120]  over you that's all any of this is all them showing they'll go against their
[35:24.120 --> 35:30.320]  humanity for this alien force so they can kill us just like the Bible says and
[35:30.320 --> 35:35.760]  you put it in high-tech science fiction sense it all makes perfect sense but it
[35:35.760 --> 35:40.840]  so that's where we are everything we see is to kill us and to destroy us because
[35:40.840 --> 35:43.680]  the US is the most powerful country in the world they want to use us as a
[35:43.680 --> 35:47.840]  transmitter to project that evil all over the world I was gonna hit the COVID
[35:47.840 --> 35:55.040]  news but I didn't do that did I don't want off into this oh isn't Bruce Jenner
[35:55.040 --> 36:00.160]  brave making hundreds of millions of dollars because he'll dress up as in a
[36:00.160 --> 36:04.560]  and a satanic clown outfit and he wants to be the Republican governor good
[36:04.560 --> 36:08.640]  that's a great freak show for them out in California and you know he'll screw
[36:08.640 --> 36:13.000]  them over just as bad as Governor Newsom did because they're puppets we must
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.640]  reject everything the system sells and does I love this the statement about oh
[36:18.640 --> 36:24.160]  Jones hates trans people no I hate the satanic force that wants to get women to
[36:24.160 --> 36:27.340]  cut their breasts off and have their ovaries cut out of their uterus is cut
[36:27.340 --> 36:32.000]  out I mean imagine an alien shows up says show your stuff show that you are in
[36:32.000 --> 36:37.680]  submission to me caught your reproductive organs out it's liberal do it for
[36:37.680 --> 36:46.760]  us destroy the child corrupt them all that's where we are and it couldn't be
[36:46.760 --> 36:51.240]  more blaring but it's gonna get more blaring you think it's turned up to 10
[36:51.240 --> 36:58.280]  look at that demon they are going to turn it up to 11 and they're the
[36:58.280 --> 37:04.720]  failures they're the losers they're the people that signed on to satanism which
[37:04.720 --> 37:09.000]  means anti-human kill steal and destroy we're made the image of God comes to
[37:09.000 --> 37:16.120]  destroy us marooned here on the planet but look where you are folks look where
[37:16.120 --> 37:22.320]  you are look what's going on look at the whole thing and you got free will and so
[37:22.320 --> 37:32.240]  if you let the snake rape your genetics and take you over all it cares about as
[37:32.240 --> 37:35.600]  you don't have children all it cares about is you don't love that children
[37:35.600 --> 37:40.800]  all it cares about it puts you in a in a trance to love yourself and to not love
[37:40.800 --> 37:44.160]  anybody else because the minute you don't love others you don't even love
[37:44.160 --> 37:52.640]  yourself and God leaves the equation and you can now be raped by the system and
[37:52.640 --> 37:56.160]  it's gonna get far worse from here on out I'm gonna cover the border with
[37:56.160 --> 38:00.960]  river nandes and where he sees all this going and just the dehumanization the
[38:00.960 --> 38:06.240]  evil spirit that is allowing us to happen and then we're going to then we're
[38:06.240 --> 38:10.200]  gonna get into this huge covid stack which is incredible how they admit it's
[38:10.200 --> 38:15.040]  a fraud doesn't work the snake eating itself back to that at allegory it is all
[38:15.040 --> 38:21.480]  coming up with this and then I've got the feds are now prosecuting federal
[38:21.480 --> 38:25.640]  employees that speak at Republican events it's a law it's unenforceable

[38:31.200 --> 38:38.600]  lovely former HUD official Lynn Patton charged with violating hatch act for
[38:38.600 --> 38:44.800]  speaking at 2020 RNC something six Obama officials did in 2012 at DNC and
[38:44.800 --> 38:49.160]  hell it hit the last deal so it's incredible oh you're a federal employee

[38:59.400 --> 39:04.360]  globalist takeover operation because under globalism the more you can

[39:07.040 --> 39:11.000]  them down the more amazing you are and then they hype up all these covid

[42:00.360 --> 42:04.080]  say first off thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this
[42:04.080 --> 42:07.400]  stupidity wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a
[42:07.400 --> 42:13.480]  year okay I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that

[42:18.760 --> 42:23.680]  two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back I wanted to just
[42:23.680 --> 42:28.600]  quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now this is Matthew
[42:28.600 --> 42:35.600]  24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and
[42:35.600 --> 42:41.000]  you shall be hated of all nations for my name sake and then shall many be
[42:41.000 --> 42:45.800]  offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another right where
[42:45.800 --> 42:49.520]  we're at brother and that's because God's name is on the founding of this
[42:49.520 --> 42:52.760]  country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because
[42:52.760 --> 42:59.440]  God created this country. The globalists are purposely collapsing our world they
[42:59.440 --> 43:04.360]  are creating insecurity, crime, war, and famine. All of us should do everything we

[47:00.160 --> 47:03.720]  great job of Kenosha other areas and then he was already coming to Texas I'm
[47:03.720 --> 47:06.720]  like well I'm going to the border to where you going the same place we kept
[47:06.720 --> 47:10.160]  running into him and it was just crazy everywhere we went
[47:10.160 --> 47:14.320]  total insanity because it's bedlam there's just illegals marching down the
[47:14.320 --> 47:18.320]  streets they're just everywhere there's buses everywhere constantly huge
[47:18.320 --> 47:22.120]  facilities that look like sports stadiums bigger than sports teams I was in a
[47:22.120 --> 47:26.000]  helicopter over it and it was just a huge sprawling they got all these back
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.800]  hose and bulldozers building I mean Joe Biden has broken our border drew
[47:30.800 --> 47:34.280]  Hernandez I had to leave we were out there yesterday I heard a bunch of other
[47:34.280 --> 47:38.880]  craziness happen that you guys showed more cars or taxies loading kids in the
[47:38.880 --> 47:44.560]  trunks disappearing into nowhere being smuggled off so so since I was with you
[47:44.560 --> 47:49.280]  20 hours ago what have you witnessed
[47:49.440 --> 47:54.120]  because I think a lot of people are confused on Twitter especially with
[47:54.120 --> 47:58.600]  what happened at the Donna facility showed up with eyes I saw you guys were
[47:58.600 --> 48:03.080]  just gonna film a report I was gonna film a report on public property right in
[48:03.080 --> 48:07.360]  front of the Donna facility nobody was there to cause any controversy nobody
[48:07.360 --> 48:11.040]  was there to troll nobody was there to try and get clout and get some footage
[48:11.040 --> 48:16.120]  or anything like that we were simply there to film a report and talk about
[48:16.120 --> 48:20.040]  what's taking place in the Donna facility so as we were doing that on
[48:20.040 --> 48:24.040]  public property which is our first amendment right to do so the security
[48:24.040 --> 48:27.880]  guards just mobbed out let's declare on the side of the highway on the right
[48:27.880 --> 48:31.800]  away by power poles they tried to say that was a property what the local they
[48:31.800 --> 48:35.640]  tried came and said we were right the police and we were right yeah when we
[48:35.640 --> 48:38.640]  spoke to the police we told them what happened we said you know we're just
[48:38.640 --> 48:41.560]  here to film a report we're not here to troll or anything like that but these
[48:41.560 --> 48:46.600]  guards feel like they have the authority to tell us Americans let alone
[48:46.600 --> 48:51.040]  Americans but journalists and reporters that we have to go across the street and
[48:51.040 --> 48:54.840]  we cannot be on public property to speak about the horrors that are taking
[48:54.840 --> 48:58.280]  place in this facility I think it's very clear Alex at this point the Biden
[48:58.280 --> 49:01.000]  administration everything that they've been promising everything that they've
[49:01.000 --> 49:05.320]  been claiming they're gonna be the most transparent administration in contrast to
[49:05.320 --> 49:09.960]  the Trump administration is absolute BS it's total lies they're not transparent
[49:09.960 --> 49:13.760]  they're the exact opposite because they're liars they cover up everything
[49:13.760 --> 49:16.760]  that they're doing because what they're doing are literal crimes against
[49:16.760 --> 49:20.840]  humanity and they won't even let us stand outside of the facility on public
[49:20.840 --> 49:24.280]  property it's one thing when Ted Cruz is in there trying to film stuff but we
[49:24.280 --> 49:29.200]  can't even stand on public property outside and I was there was for that
[49:29.200 --> 49:32.280]  and I want to get you on as soon as you can I gotta leave your play out of
[49:32.280 --> 49:36.720]  there soon but let's go back to yesterday I had to leave it like and like
[49:36.720 --> 49:41.520]  four o'clock to just lie back what I heard it was even crazier once I left
[49:41.520 --> 49:46.200]  what happened yeah I mean just for the record for people listening because a
[49:46.200 --> 49:49.840]  lot of people smear Alex Jones they slander Alex Jones they say that he's
[49:49.840 --> 49:53.600]  crazy that he's a conspiracy theorist especially in the context of talking
[49:53.600 --> 49:58.440]  about children being trafficked and pedophilia and all these things but now
[49:58.440 --> 50:03.880]  we literally have you Alex the world has seen this isn't a QAnon theory we
[50:03.880 --> 50:09.240]  ran into a human smuggler okay in the United States this guy had his car
[50:09.240 --> 50:13.480]  packed with little kids there was no adults in the car by the way they were
[50:13.480 --> 50:17.920]  little kids he was packing into the back of a hatchback without any seats not
[50:17.920 --> 50:23.520]  just no seat belts not just no car seats no seats and Alex you put yourself
[50:23.520 --> 50:27.640]  literally in front of an automobile this guy was trying to run you over so
[50:27.640 --> 50:31.520]  anybody out there that's trying to smear Alex Jones and say oh he's just as
[50:31.520 --> 50:34.840]  crazy conspiracy theorist Alex literally put his life on the line for these
[50:34.840 --> 50:38.680]  little kids because this guy was not identifying himself he was not being
[50:38.680 --> 50:41.800]  honest he was saying he wasn't a part of that Catholic organization he was
[50:41.800 --> 50:45.520]  actually trying to tell us he was taking them to the COVID-19 facility when in
[50:45.520 --> 50:49.200]  reality that's where they came from so this guy was lying to our faces so what
[50:49.200 --> 50:52.760]  are we supposed to do Alex just sit there and let this guy who's unidentified
[50:52.760 --> 50:57.960]  take a look at this I mean we're talking now tens of millions of years I'm
[50:57.960 --> 51:02.960]  told on TikTok they are people want action and not violent action but that's
[51:02.960 --> 51:07.600]  illegal they're just randomly grabbing kids with no ID shoving them the back of
[51:07.600 --> 51:11.240]  a car driving them off and he lied to us about where they were going we don't
[51:11.240 --> 51:16.240]  know where they were going was the airport airport hotel but it doesn't
[51:16.240 --> 51:20.120]  matter that this is all under the table this is all off the record this is not
[51:20.120 --> 51:23.720]  being done legitimately this should not be taking place any way shape or form and
[51:23.720 --> 51:27.800]  here's the point I wanted to make for the viewers this is just one link in the
[51:27.800 --> 51:31.760]  chain okay this starts with the criminal cartels on the Mexican side of the
[51:31.760 --> 51:35.480]  border they send them over to the board of patrol the board of patrol will
[51:35.480 --> 51:39.320]  apprehend them they will bust them to the Donna facility or a nearby detention
[51:39.320 --> 51:42.880]  facility and from there they will send them to the COVID-19 testing facility
[51:42.880 --> 51:47.680]  and from there they will send them to this so-called Catholic charity to give
[51:47.680 --> 51:52.360]  the people or give the kids needs but in reality this so-called charity is
[51:52.360 --> 51:56.480]  stuffing kids into this car Alex it's all a part of the operation this is not
[51:56.480 --> 52:02.360]  listen Alex this is not just a crisis this is a strategically planned crisis
[52:02.360 --> 52:06.720]  it's very organized it's very very organized and there are many many moving
[52:06.720 --> 52:10.520]  parts that are taking place with the criminal cartel to the federal government
[52:10.520 --> 52:19.760]  exactly we don't want to get by a trouble but border patrol to police you name it we talked to them they said listen this is racketeering
[52:19.760 --> 52:23.920]  Biden hasn't even signed the executive order it's not a law this is only legal
[52:23.920 --> 52:27.880]  but we're like where's the Texas Rangers where's governor Abbott he has a bunch of
[52:27.880 --> 52:30.800]  state police there they're all there right and tickets to citizens and I'm
[52:30.800 --> 52:34.520]  not I mean just it's all giant racketeering as you said it's all
[52:34.520 --> 52:40.360]  organized by the NGOs the UN these big leftist groups on the other side these
[52:40.360 --> 52:43.840]  the so-called Catholic charity I've got it right here she's a Democrat time
[52:43.840 --> 52:48.400]  magazine top hundred women liberal she's not even Catholic I mean it's incredible
[52:48.400 --> 52:53.840]  yeah they it's tons of frauds but what I want people to understand is that I think
[52:53.840 --> 52:57.720]  what the radical left is trying to do Alex is convince the public that this is
[52:57.720 --> 53:01.380]  somehow some kind of crisis a climate crisis these people are coming to claim
[53:01.380 --> 53:06.600]  asylum which some are but at the same time shut down for a year the third
[53:06.600 --> 53:09.680]  world is starving it up there it is a crisis they created with a covered lock
[53:09.680 --> 53:13.640]  down then they rush our borders keep going yeah and they're instigating this
[53:13.640 --> 53:16.840]  and they're causing this because there's a lot of people out there that has
[53:16.840 --> 53:20.040]  sympathy for the migrants and I understand that because I do too and so do
[53:20.040 --> 53:23.040]  you Alex that's why we did what we did yesterday absolutely because these are
[53:23.040 --> 53:26.920]  children right that's why we took that action and some people on Twitter some
[53:26.920 --> 53:30.080]  people in the comments sections oh all the yelling is unnecessary this is like
[53:30.080 --> 53:33.920]  well what are we supposed to do what are we supposed to do when we walk up on
[53:33.920 --> 53:38.120]  this we didn't plan this this isn't theatrically staged these aren't crisis
[53:38.120 --> 53:42.760]  actors this is real life this is what is happening this is taking place in Alex
[53:42.760 --> 53:46.240]  I think most people the viewers when they think about human trafficking and
[53:46.240 --> 53:49.880]  when they when they see footage from the border and they see they imagine
[53:49.880 --> 53:53.600]  cartels I think they imagine all this stuff taking place at night which it
[53:53.600 --> 53:57.560]  does but it also takes place in broad daylight that's what they told us the
[53:57.560 --> 54:00.760]  board patrol said used to it was all at night now and almost nothing's at night
[54:00.760 --> 54:06.280]  except for drug dealing it's everywhere in the United States this is
[54:06.280 --> 54:09.720]  happening in the United States and what if these kids get into a car accident
[54:09.720 --> 54:13.240]  what if they get rear-ended this is irresponsible whether there and where
[54:13.240 --> 54:18.160]  are they being delivered like this is their parents but they 7 to 14% of the
[54:18.160 --> 54:22.060]  time they admitted that it was not their parents when Trump did DNA testing they
[54:22.060 --> 54:27.160]  don't want DNA testing kids go across the international line you just release
[54:27.160 --> 54:32.440]  them Alex I don't know if you notice this but I didn't notice this until after
[54:32.440 --> 54:35.800]  I viewed the footage and I noticed it when it was happening in real time as
[54:35.800 --> 54:40.000]  well to confirm it the girl that was sitting in the front that was I thought
[54:40.000 --> 54:44.440]  she was I thought she was like 11 okay when she got out I don't know if you
[54:44.440 --> 54:48.000]  guys can play clips or if you guys saw this in the clips when that little girl
[54:48.000 --> 54:52.240]  got out of the front seat I was shocked because she was pregnant that girl was
[54:52.240 --> 54:56.800]  at least 10 11 years old no point you made she looks like a little she looks
[54:56.800 --> 55:04.120]  like like you know this blows me away my daughters it's it's it's it's it's it
[55:04.120 --> 55:08.360]  makes you sick to your stomach Alex like there's no getting around this there's
[55:08.360 --> 55:12.760]  no explaining this there's no excuses for this and I keep going back to the fact
[55:12.760 --> 55:17.280]  that this is strategically planned this is why I always say from the beginning
[55:17.280 --> 55:21.320]  the administration doesn't care because these little girls get raped kidnapped
[55:21.320 --> 55:24.120]  and murdered on the border and that little girl that we saw in that front
[55:24.120 --> 55:28.360]  seat those are one of the victims of Joe Biden calling to immediately surge the
[55:28.360 --> 55:31.760]  border and there's no notice with us I know you got to get out of the hotel
[55:31.760 --> 55:34.800]  into your plane they're probably banging on the door back they were banging over
[55:34.800 --> 55:38.800]  earlier but five more minutes we'll be back on the side we've got a bunch of
[55:38.800 --> 55:43.800]  other big guests and I will go over all the border videos and news next hour

[57:43.200 --> 57:47.720]  yourself at infowarstore.com
[57:48.560 --> 57:54.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[57:57.560 --> 58:01.960]  so the board of patrol is totally overwhelmed we're not lionizing I'm
[58:01.960 --> 58:05.640]  really upset about what's happening and they are aiding and abetting this they
[58:05.640 --> 58:09.640]  haven't ordered is so but we're aiding and abetting it we as citizens don't do
[58:09.640 --> 58:12.840]  anything drew bananas in five minutes we've got left as you get ready to leave
[58:12.840 --> 58:15.560]  your hotel and fly it like an hour and a half we appreciate you being here so
[58:15.560 --> 58:20.200]  close to wire you were telling me before we left here so this was crazier and you
[58:20.200 --> 58:24.080]  thought it would be me too I've been down there a lot this was nuts other points
[58:24.080 --> 58:27.080]  you want to relate to viewers out there about what you witness on the Texas
[58:27.080 --> 58:32.040]  board one thing I want the viewers to really consider and think about is where
[58:32.040 --> 58:36.040]  we go from here and I think this is a hard conversation to have because a lot
[58:36.040 --> 58:39.160]  of people will say we'll just deport them send them home get them out of here
[58:39.160 --> 58:42.440]  but we know that's not going to take place because we have an administration
[58:42.440 --> 58:46.440]  like I said that has strategically done this for the purpose of not only votes
[58:46.440 --> 58:51.240]  for the midterms not votes for the next presidential election not votes for the
[58:51.240 --> 58:56.960]  one after that they have generational plans these are generations of voters of
[58:56.960 --> 59:00.680]  future voters for the Democrat Party the Democrats play ball this way they think
[59:00.680 --> 59:05.240]  in centuries while Republicans think in the next election I'll break the
[59:05.240 --> 59:09.400]  black family and I'll have these inwards voting for us honored ears and that's
[59:09.400 --> 59:12.960]  exactly what they're doing now to these Latin Americans these people coming
[59:12.960 --> 59:16.680]  from Central America they only see them as commodities the cartels but the
[59:16.680 --> 59:20.960]  Democrats only see them as future voters so so I think the conversation we have
[59:20.960 --> 59:24.640]  to talk about our solutions now they're here I don't think they're gonna go
[59:24.640 --> 59:30.520]  anywhere so I think right now activists especially Hispanics Americans that are
[59:30.520 --> 59:34.280]  Hispanics I think right now what we have to do is we really do have to reach out
[59:34.280 --> 59:38.160]  to these communities and we have to educate them to get them to understand
[59:38.160 --> 59:42.440]  that they have been brought here for that specific reason only they don't
[59:42.440 --> 59:45.680]  have to be slaves to the Democrat Party they don't have to be on the Democrat
[59:45.680 --> 59:49.600]  plantation they don't have to fall into the hands of the evil Democrats my
[59:49.600 --> 59:54.080]  next point obviously this is illegal and exploited we got to stop it and try but
[59:54.080 --> 59:58.600]  for those that are already here Trump getting 50 60% Hispanic vote double any
[59:58.600 --> 1:00:03.520]  Republican but double black vote that scares them so how does that not fit
[1:00:03.520 --> 1:00:06.520]  into the leftist plan if we reach out to these communities they've shown they're
[1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:10.720]  very responsive and I agree and I'm pretty sure a lot of viewers are
[1:00:10.720 --> 1:00:14.260]  disagreeing with me right now but I have to make this point because we have an
[1:00:14.260 --> 1:00:17.600]  administration that is not gonna get rid of these people that's that's the fact
[1:00:17.600 --> 1:00:20.880]  right Alex that's the reality they're not gonna deport them they're here to
[1:00:20.880 --> 1:00:23.960]  stay so I think right now we have to play their game and I think we should
[1:00:23.960 --> 1:00:29.240]  reach out to these communities red pill them expose them to the truth oh yeah
[1:00:29.240 --> 1:00:33.520]  don't go to a rally remember six years ago if you're Hispanic or black they'll
[1:00:33.520 --> 1:00:36.960]  beat you up but instead it was all love we need to reach out these people I
[1:00:36.960 --> 1:00:41.960]  agree yeah you get accused of being a race trader you get accused of betraying
[1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:46.160]  your race this predominantly comes from the radical left especially if you're
[1:00:46.160 --> 1:00:49.520]  Hispanic or you're black or you're a person of color anytime you start to
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:53.000]  think for yourself and you depart from the radical left thinking they
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:57.560]  immediately start to call you all kinds of evil and hateful words they accuse
[1:00:57.560 --> 1:01:01.840]  you of being a race trader but these people listen they act like this is love
[1:01:01.840 --> 1:01:07.000]  compassion and care but the moment you depart from their agenda they turn on
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:12.680]  you they turn hundreds of children a day I'd have it like a Mercedes van or a
[1:01:12.680 --> 1:01:18.040]  Dodge van or a Ford van with baby seats they don't even care about seat belts
[1:01:18.040 --> 1:01:22.200]  they treat these kids like they're bags of tomatoes or something and you know what
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:28.720]  Alex even after that you know we witnessed some taxis that taxis I believe
[1:01:28.720 --> 1:01:32.920]  the individual actually owned the taxi business was picking up kids as well and
[1:01:32.920 --> 1:01:36.040]  not putting them in car seats they could barely put the seat belt on and wrap it
[1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:39.800]  around their bodies and we confronted them as well and they were refusing to
[1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:43.680]  listen to us the same thing so when I actually talked to two staff members that
[1:01:43.680 --> 1:01:47.080]  came out the first woman I talked to I asked her I said why don't you guys
[1:01:47.080 --> 1:01:50.680]  care about these children you guys don't you guys don't consider that if they get
[1:01:50.680 --> 1:01:55.960]  rear-ended these kids could fly through the front windshield mirror and die you
[1:01:55.960 --> 1:01:59.480]  guys aren't concerned that if they get rear-ended they can get crushed and her
[1:01:59.480 --> 1:02:04.080]  response to me was literally I know and I talked to another staff
[1:02:04.080 --> 1:02:08.160]  member and I confronted her in the back of the facility and on camera I asked
[1:02:08.160 --> 1:02:12.040]  her why are you guys doing this do you guys think this is Christ like I said
[1:02:12.040 --> 1:02:16.120]  would Jesus do something like this and the response in the answer I got was the
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:20.760]  door slammed in my face and I think these people are just they're deceived I
[1:02:20.760 --> 1:02:23.320]  think they think they're doing the right thing they don't understand that
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:26.360]  they're aiding and abetting human smuggling operations from the southern
[1:02:26.360 --> 1:02:30.760]  border and in totality this is an evil operation that's been instigated by the
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:33.960]  Biden administration and I think at least right now we need to reach out to
[1:02:33.960 --> 1:02:40.360]  these people and I totally agree you're absolutely right these people think
[1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:43.520]  they're doing the right thing we have to expose as well we have to be there great
[1:02:43.520 --> 1:02:47.960]  job look forward to having you back on soon amazing a safe trip back to Arizona
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:53.400]  you'll be back with the other news COVID and more
[1:02:53.600 --> 1:03:00.440]  you cannot hide a grand assault America is about to have its energy cut off its
[1:03:00.440 --> 1:03:06.120]  borders destroyed its dollar brought down to nothing all of you that have served
[1:03:06.120 --> 1:03:11.080]  Satan believe that you are the right team you're about to find out how
[1:03:11.080 --> 1:03:18.720]  pathetic you are so I ask all of you who are awake and who love God stop living
[1:03:18.720 --> 1:03:25.560]  in fear the enemy is about to expose itself the enemy can't help itself the
[1:03:25.560 --> 1:03:32.120]  enemy comes to kill steal destroy we sit here as good people get upset about that
[1:03:32.120 --> 1:03:38.240]  and how to stop it we should but once it comes through once it hits us once it's
[1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:43.000]  dominating us and raping us and attacking us we just have to point out we
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:48.240]  tried to stop it so prepare yourselves America you're going under the judge but
[1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:53.000]  just like all the children that were aborted this is the truth this is the
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.800]  info war
[1:03:55.800 --> 1:04:06.840]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[1:04:08.920 --> 1:04:14.840]  Google shows hundreds of holidays a year other we're leftist events they will
[1:04:14.840 --> 1:04:19.640]  never show Easter they did it again this last weekend showing their hatred of
[1:04:19.640 --> 1:04:25.040]  God and of Christ believe it God or not why is it they're so scared of this
[1:04:25.040 --> 1:04:31.280]  because they know Christian to oppose or see canning or government take over go
[1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:35.880]  to Google's front page right now please for any unheard of person or
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:39.480]  organization or religion or group don't don't put up the Google Doodle but
[1:04:39.480 --> 1:04:44.160]  nothing on probably the most holy day in the Christian religion billions of
[1:04:44.160 --> 1:04:48.000]  Christians worldwide nothing about Christianity on the Google front page
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.320]  you can see right there ladies and gentlemen that there's nothing there they
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:55.360]  put up stuff for Islam the Buddhist Satanism everything in between but not
[1:04:55.360 --> 1:05:00.600]  Christianity so ask yourself why is that well they see Christianity is bad they
[1:05:00.600 --> 1:05:03.880]  see Christianity as the enemy they discriminate against Christianity because
[1:05:03.880 --> 1:05:08.280]  Google is inherently evil and Christianity warns warns about a
[1:05:08.280 --> 1:05:13.160]  worldwide Margaret the Beast Christianity warns about assisted to buy and sell
[1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:16.360]  Christianity warns about what's now unfolding oh they've bought off most
[1:05:16.360 --> 1:05:20.040]  the churches I'm not saying you're gonna find Christ in those churches I'm
[1:05:20.040 --> 1:05:23.600]  talking about what's really in the Bible what's really unfolding that's really
[1:05:23.600 --> 1:05:27.600]  happening and you saw how they were controlling you they you saw how they
[1:05:27.600 --> 1:05:32.160]  were manipulating your science they you saw how they were slowly but surely
[1:05:32.160 --> 1:05:37.360]  bending your species and turning you into something else something ugly
[1:05:37.360 --> 1:05:41.240]  something stupid something controllable really just because they were jealous of
[1:05:41.240 --> 1:05:46.600]  you and it's in the resistance to that that you would find who you are Pope
[1:05:46.600 --> 1:05:50.800]  Francis speaks about a lot of things as you know he's called the activist Pope
[1:05:50.800 --> 1:05:55.120]  but he's silent on the persecution of Uighur Muslims by China other
[1:05:55.120 --> 1:05:59.720]  religious communities including Muslims consider Pope Francis a friend they're
[1:05:59.720 --> 1:06:05.240]  appealing for his help but he remains quiet the question is why why is he
[1:06:05.240 --> 1:06:11.280]  bowing to China when he must only bow to God but if you don't have a desire to
[1:06:11.280 --> 1:06:15.880]  resist that even the hypothetical example I just gave that you don't have
[1:06:15.880 --> 1:06:20.400]  consciousness you are in a sleep state or maybe you're totally turned over to
[1:06:20.400 --> 1:06:24.960]  the spirit and are actually believing in your own destruction because you have
[1:06:24.960 --> 1:06:30.200]  some form of self-loathing but this is not the fanciful aliens of Hollywood
[1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:34.600]  we're talking about this is the globalist that in their own publications
[1:06:34.600 --> 1:06:40.360]  countless publications like Brave New World revisited and the statements of
[1:06:40.360 --> 1:06:45.320]  Ray Kurzweil and so many others say we believe humanity has fallen and failed
[1:06:45.320 --> 1:06:50.480]  and ugly because they think that of themselves and we are going to accelerate
[1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:56.160]  mass mutations in the population and massive degradation and we believe out
[1:06:56.160 --> 1:07:02.320]  of that will rise the uber mention it's called gene editing it's altering DNA
[1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:05.840]  and it's one of the things that our intelligence shows that China is doing
[1:07:05.840 --> 1:07:10.000]  they've got a the PRC the People's Republic of China has two million strong
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:15.720]  in its military and it's trying to make them stronger through you know gene
[1:07:15.720 --> 1:07:21.360]  editing and that's just one of the ways that you know China is trying to
[1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:26.160]  essentially dominate the planet and set the rules in the world order and and why
[1:07:26.160 --> 1:07:29.800]  it's so important and people need to understand is this is an authoritarian
[1:07:29.800 --> 1:07:33.080]  regime it doesn't care about people's individual rights we've seen what they've
[1:07:33.080 --> 1:07:36.720]  done to the Uyghurs we've seen what they've done in Hong Kong it's about
[1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:42.640]  putting the state first and that is the exact opposite of what has always made
[1:07:42.640 --> 1:07:46.200]  America great and it is true that that which doesn't kill you only makes you
[1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:52.000]  stronger but these people are projecting their own hatred of themselves on to us
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:56.880]  and then using that excuse that they're trying to save humanity and trying to
[1:07:56.880 --> 1:08:01.480]  make us go through this metamorphosis as really just an excuse to carry out
[1:08:01.480 --> 1:08:07.920]  their incredibly sadistic activities so my broadcast is not here for people that
[1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:12.640]  live in Lala land it's not here people that just want to have the normal
[1:08:12.640 --> 1:08:17.640]  political kind of sports like news where we just battle left right this is
[1:08:17.640 --> 1:08:23.960]  about transcendence and a resurrection of the human spirit towards God's will
[1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:33.720]  and God's destiny but God is free will you must choose that
[1:08:53.960 --> 1:09:04.440]  humanity has any gun to reach the top all right we are back live here well
[1:09:04.440 --> 1:09:11.160]  into our number two and I have a rebel media reporter who is outside a main
[1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:16.040]  line church where the pastor has been in jail off and on for months they put a
[1:09:16.040 --> 1:09:20.240]  fence up around it because people still go there but when black lives matter for
[1:09:20.240 --> 1:09:26.640]  the communist march the police worship it but all over Canada the neighbors the
[1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:33.160]  satanic liberals just watch the churches and the minute somebody goes in they
[1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:41.240]  just sometimes 20 police cars 30 police cars just show the right what are you
[1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:47.400]  doing oh you can't breathe on each other it's simply amazing and here it is
[1:09:47.400 --> 1:09:55.080]  New Hampshire track coach is fired for violating high school mass mandate in
[1:09:55.080 --> 1:09:58.440]  fact I'm going to tell the crew can you guys pull up the video this it's all
[1:09:58.440 --> 1:10:05.320]  over the world track members participants run with a mask on their
[1:10:05.320 --> 1:10:13.840]  faces all a Milgram experiment to see how ridiculous you can make it oh we're
[1:10:13.840 --> 1:10:20.040]  gonna put men biological men and women sports whether it's boxing whether it's
[1:10:20.040 --> 1:10:22.960]  wrestling whether it's weightlifting whether it's soccer whether it's
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:28.400]  football whether it's pole vaulting whether it's shot put whether it's
[1:10:28.400 --> 1:10:35.040]  discus whether everything who hey girls told you you can't win any against the
[1:10:35.040 --> 1:10:39.840]  guys even when you're in your own division the guys are gonna come in and
[1:10:39.840 --> 1:10:44.160]  put a wig on and beat you they used to call those bullies and thugs and scumbags
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:49.680]  and scammers and perverts and weirdos but the Milgram and Stanford research
[1:10:49.680 --> 1:10:52.640]  studies these are just the ones I mentioned they've got thousands of these
[1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:58.120]  that we know of they found the majority of participants would murder people when
[1:10:58.120 --> 1:11:08.800]  ordered to do so by a authority figure and so now they have people running long
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:18.640]  distance races marathons was a marathon 23 miles I forget yeah 23 miles 23 miles
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:24.400]  with a dirty filthy diaper that does nothing splattering spit all of your
[1:11:24.400 --> 1:11:30.120]  face all of your eyes bacteria everywhere and here's the coach yeah queue
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:34.920]  that up want to play the audio tell me when you're ready there he is fired that
[1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:39.160]  we were deploying the full resources of the federal government calling forth
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:44.480]  the full power of the American economy to meet this moment and I and I
[1:11:44.480 --> 1:11:49.040]  promise you Sandra we're gonna continue to do that every step of the way until
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:52.080]  until we have well that's kind of understand I'm not sure what we're
[1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:57.440]  playing but it's kind of fun so after the break we'll take our time we'll
[1:11:57.440 --> 1:12:01.720]  figure out what we're playing and then we'll play that clip for you that's the
[1:12:01.720 --> 1:12:05.520]  fun part about live TV I have no idea what we just aired but there was for
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:13.960]  TV viewers radio listeners were we're a simulcast radio TV program but for
[1:12:13.960 --> 1:12:17.240]  viewers you can always see what we're playing for for listeners I have no
[1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:21.280]  earthly idea what you're listening to but as I said that's going on so let me
[1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:24.760]  show you some more of these headlights New Hampshire track coach is fired for
[1:12:24.760 --> 1:12:30.000]  violating a high school's mask mandate the left never gonna give this loose they
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:36.200]  want power over people their cult the feds are pushing pension funds toward
[1:12:36.200 --> 1:12:40.440]  society responsible investing see your money now I must do what the left says
[1:12:40.440 --> 1:12:46.280]  or you're bad got that too but when we come back I'm gonna be very judicious
[1:12:46.280 --> 1:12:50.120]  actually I'm gonna play all this for you US begin studying on allergic
[1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:56.040]  reaction in Moderna's Pfizer vaccines but I mean that I thought everything was
[1:12:56.040 --> 1:13:00.800]  studied I thought it was all safe I thought it was all good I mean a woman
[1:13:00.800 --> 1:13:05.120]  took the shot and said on Facebook I'm dying I'm dying she did die and Facebook
[1:13:05.120 --> 1:13:09.840]  said this vaccine's completely tested there's no connection to death even
[1:13:09.840 --> 1:13:14.440]  though it's not tested and it's connected to death Facebook said you're dead and we
[1:13:14.440 --> 1:13:22.360]  didn't kill you liberal so that's all coming up today as well this just gets
[1:13:22.360 --> 1:13:28.160]  crazier and crazier immunologist warns Pfizer Moderna coronavirus vaccines may
[1:13:28.160 --> 1:13:32.160]  cause neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's yeah print that for me
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:39.160]  because that came out back in February now it's mainstream news yeah people
[1:13:39.160 --> 1:13:44.560]  collapsing while running in mass G but you'll do anything hell I guarantee it
[1:13:44.560 --> 1:13:48.880]  I'm not joking they went on seeing it and they said jog with your finger up your
[1:13:48.880 --> 1:13:54.760]  rear end your thumb up your ass stand on your head they do it epic is one of only
[1:13:54.760 --> 1:14:00.560]  a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of
[1:14:00.560 --> 1:14:04.880]  association and they know that big tech is buying up almost all the other major
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:08.640]  companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime
[1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:12.760]  racketeering that's why they've been massively expanding their services so
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:15.960]  whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:20.240]  a website or want servers or any other major service they've got it all and
[1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:25.520]  they're expanding and if you go to info wars domains.com and follow that link you
[1:14:25.520 --> 1:14:30.880]  get all their services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new
[1:14:30.880 --> 1:14:35.880]  domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war then we get 5% as well for
[1:14:35.880 --> 1:14:39.600]  any servers or any other type of services that you get from them so it's a
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:43.720]  win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists
[1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:49.160]  are destroying what was open and what was free so info wars domains.com the
[1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:54.880]  revolution starts there info wars domains.com take action now the equation
[1:14:54.880 --> 1:15:00.720]  is very simple the mega banks control the media they control big pharma they
[1:15:00.720 --> 1:15:06.040]  control academia they control the military industrial complex they control
[1:15:06.040 --> 1:15:11.280]  big tech and everywhere that they have been in control in the third world they
[1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:17.160]  have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization it is the
[1:15:17.160 --> 1:15:21.960]  western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and then promoted
[1:15:21.960 --> 1:15:25.800]  women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them so because they
[1:15:25.800 --> 1:15:31.480]  can't defeat that empowering ethic they instead co-opted turn it upside down and
[1:15:31.480 --> 1:15:37.920]  use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free
[1:15:37.920 --> 1:15:42.440]  market that threatens their monopoly so control that's why they target info wars
[1:15:42.440 --> 1:15:46.240]  because we understand the keys to defeating them but the only way our
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:51.360]  transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video so we double
[1:15:51.360 --> 1:15:54.840]  your efforts we're all in this together
[1:15:54.840 --> 1:16:11.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:16:24.840 --> 1:16:32.640]  so we're under global corporate attack these corporations want full control of
[1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:39.880]  human development hold control of human evolution in their words believe it
[1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:48.120]  or not and they are breaking down every form of stability to carry that out so
[1:16:48.120 --> 1:16:53.660]  you should know that they're ruthless they're beyond evil they are beyond
[1:16:53.660 --> 1:17:04.000]  exploitive they are absolutely completely against God and so here's what's
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:11.400]  happening all over the world go to the Olympics biological men are gonna win
[1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:19.840]  every event weightlifting right down the line to long-distance running it's all
[1:17:19.840 --> 1:17:23.640]  men because they're gonna call themselves women and the feminists will
[1:17:23.640 --> 1:17:27.800]  accept that love that because it's part of the death of male and female
[1:17:27.800 --> 1:17:32.600]  reproduction in our species this is all death feminists are not into life or
[1:17:32.600 --> 1:17:37.640]  power for women they are into enslavement not a woman with a man a woman
[1:17:37.640 --> 1:17:43.880]  with a state wedded to it and even the feminists are starting to figure this
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:47.520]  out but it's a day late a dollar short because the breakdown of the family has
[1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:53.880]  already occurred some a bunch of these newscast and clips I want to play but I
[1:17:53.880 --> 1:18:01.800]  have countless pieces about people dying after they take the COVID shot and the
[1:18:01.800 --> 1:18:06.320]  fact checkers say we're sorry there's no adverse effects is totally safe even
[1:18:06.320 --> 1:18:10.040]  though the insert says it's not says it's experimental says it can kill you
[1:18:10.040 --> 1:18:14.920]  they say on the news sorry she's dead she's not allowed to say on Facebook I'm
[1:18:14.920 --> 1:18:20.400]  dying she died it killed her the vaccine is killing me Facebook fact checkers
[1:18:20.400 --> 1:18:25.240]  check woman's post about COVID vaccine adverse reactions she died a week later
[1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:31.920]  and they stand by it with pleasure but it's okay because they're all liberal and
[1:18:31.920 --> 1:18:37.040]  wear pink sweaters and her like cool trendy guys that talk like this oh hi
[1:18:37.040 --> 1:18:45.960]  I'm not threatening I'm like in PR oh that should have got come out like a
[1:18:45.960 --> 1:18:51.480]  multi-colored light green light blue sweater go here's water we're liberal
[1:18:51.480 --> 1:18:59.200]  with a mask on and again she died but they said sorry lady you're not even
[1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:04.000]  allowed to say it hurt it didn't hurt you love that you die and you enjoyed it
[1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:10.720]  my Zuckerberg says but how many collapsed lungs do we have for people
[1:19:10.720 --> 1:19:15.120]  running long-distance runs or even fast runs with these masks where the lungs
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:20.160]  just go out of control a lot to the news they're out the middle of the sun the
[1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:24.040]  middle of it oh but you just got it everyone needs to see it and the more
[1:19:24.040 --> 1:19:29.640]  ridiculous the better as I said well stay on your head well walk on one leg
[1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:35.600]  hop on one leg well it's all about what will you do for the cold how will you
[1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:39.560]  submit like Biden walking up going you need to social distance to a woman
[1:19:39.560 --> 1:19:45.840]  interface like that's oxymoronic it's supposed to be it's like him on to get
[1:19:45.840 --> 1:19:56.600]  cvq up next segment him on Easter with a big giant Easter bunny wearing a mask and
[1:19:56.600 --> 1:20:00.200]  then he and his wife were up there she's in fishnets whatever that means for a
[1:20:00.200 --> 1:20:04.280]  70-something-year-old woman just all weird him in a heater dresses like aviator
[1:20:04.280 --> 1:20:09.440]  outfits like it's a superhero and and and and then they pull back and no one's
[1:20:09.440 --> 1:20:16.760]  there but oh look they're wearing their mask it's all theater like booty judge

[1:20:57.640 --> 1:21:01.600]  New Hampshire track coach is fired he just said I can't put up with the lies

[1:21:12.240 --> 1:21:15.800]  you see and it's all about what can the cult do that's the Department of
[1:21:15.800 --> 1:21:21.880]  Education here it is your track coach is out of a job after making it clear that
[1:21:21.880 --> 1:21:26.400]  he wasn't going to make his athletes wear masks I'm Paula and I'm David Wade
[1:21:26.400 --> 1:21:30.480]  the former coach at Pembroke Academy says even though it cost him his job he
[1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:34.680]  is not backing down from his beliefs WBZ's Michael Kross spoke with him
[1:21:34.680 --> 1:21:40.080]  today I just think people haven't pushed back and I decided it was time to push
[1:21:40.080 --> 1:21:45.440]  back Brad Keys was fired this week as the track and field coach at Pembroke
[1:21:45.440 --> 1:21:50.280]  Academy in Pembroke New Hampshire and he has been outspoken about it online I
[1:21:50.280 --> 1:21:55.440]  made my choice he made his he says he was not going to force his athletes to
[1:21:55.440 --> 1:22:00.120]  wear masks while competing masks restrict breathing there's no question
[1:22:00.120 --> 1:22:04.520]  about it especially think about running full speed the wind is in your face it's
[1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:09.200]  shoving the mask back into your nose in your mouth he's one of my favorite people
[1:22:09.200 --> 1:22:13.320]  to run with junior David Testament agrees with his former coach it is
[1:22:13.320 --> 1:22:17.880]  concerned about running with a mask on this spring gets you really tired
[1:22:17.880 --> 1:22:22.120]  especially on you know it's going to get up to 80 degrees soon and it's going
[1:22:22.120 --> 1:22:26.000]  to be really hard for us to keep doing what we like to do the New Hampshire
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:31.320]  inter scholastic athletic associations outdoor track guidelines recommend that
[1:22:31.320 --> 1:22:35.880]  athletes wear a face covering during competition pause they'll be separated
[1:22:35.880 --> 1:22:40.440]  some god group recommends like a year ago oh here's a QR code to the go the

[1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:53.200]  needs to watch the spars 20 25 20 28 video at Bandai video as negative as
[1:24:53.200 --> 1:24:58.480]  times are right now and as depressing as things can be you have to understand
[1:24:58.480 --> 1:25:04.600]  that this is all attached this experience this life on this planet is a
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:11.280]  reckoning it's God giving us a chance to work things out the third dimension so
[1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:14.680]  we can decide where we want to spend eternity what level we want to go to
[1:25:14.680 --> 1:25:19.720]  and it really does come down to that so as saddest things are and as evil as
[1:25:19.720 --> 1:25:23.360]  things are look at all the good in the world as well and realize that God is the
[1:25:23.360 --> 1:25:29.280]  author of our consciousness God is the author of us having our own will God is
[1:25:29.280 --> 1:25:35.360]  the author of us having free will and that free will is a beautiful thing when
[1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:38.520]  you look at mainstream media in Hollywood this whole evil culture in
[1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:43.600]  Washington DC and Fauci and the and the mass cult it's all about dominating a

[1:27:12.360 --> 1:27:17.680]  legend Kava was given as a gift by the Sun God Tagaloa who they considered to be
[1:27:17.680 --> 1:27:22.280]  the supreme ruler and creator of the universe. The Samoan people would drink
[1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:26.720]  Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.

[1:28:00.040 --> 1:28:22.440]  Yeah so this Woodlands teenager says he got the very rare Geyon Beret syndrome a
[1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:26.640]  few weeks after his first dose of the COVID vaccine. I spoke to him today about
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:31.560]  what he wants you to know and what doctors have to say. Wyatt McGlon says
[1:28:31.560 --> 1:28:35.440]  he's a busy healthy high school senior and because of his part-time job he was
[1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:39.960]  eligible for the COVID vaccine in early March. I wanted to get the vaccine just I
[1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:44.160]  felt like it was the right thing to do. I wanted to travel and enjoy my last
[1:28:44.160 --> 1:28:50.400]  summer before college. But then something bad happened. I had to pick him up my
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:56.160]  six foot three completely healthy boy. Wyatt became extremely weak and had
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:29:01.400]  difficulty walking. At the hospital he was told he has Geyon Beret an extremely
[1:29:01.400 --> 1:29:06.560]  rare syndrome that he says must be caused by his vaccine. I just knew you
[1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:10.200]  know like something didn't feel right it wasn't getting any better. While the NIH
[1:29:10.200 --> 1:29:13.880]  says of the millions of doses of COVID vaccines given there has been one
[1:29:13.880 --> 1:29:19.280]  reported case of Geyon Beret in an 82 year old woman. Dr. Charles Sims, Montgomery
[1:29:19.280 --> 1:29:22.520]  County Health Authority and infectious disease doctor from St. Luke's in the
[1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:27.360]  Woodlands says it is more often caused by a viral or bacterial infection and he
[1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:31.600]  can't say that the vaccine caused this. There are having cases of Geyon Beret
[1:29:31.600 --> 1:29:36.160]  seen and people have received the vaccine but they're not at any at a
[1:29:36.160 --> 1:29:40.120]  higher rate than people who have not received the vaccine. Geyon Beret is
[1:29:40.120 --> 1:29:44.960]  seen in about one to two per million people per year. Therefore the doctor
[1:29:44.960 --> 1:29:49.280]  says this could be just a coincidence. Wyatt's parents say they're not trying to
[1:29:49.280 --> 1:29:53.200]  deter anyone from getting the vaccine but they do want others to recognize if
[1:29:53.200 --> 1:29:58.520]  this happens to them. Do your research not that vaccines are a bad idea or a
[1:29:58.520 --> 1:30:02.960]  bad thing or anything but it's a personal choice. Listen to your body this is the
[1:30:02.960 --> 1:30:08.360]  biggest thing that I've learned. Dr. Sims says if these alleged adverse
[1:30:08.360 --> 1:30:13.280]  reactions are reported to the CDC they will be investigated and Wyatt's family
[1:30:13.280 --> 1:30:19.480]  tells me that they do plan to report it. We've got a lot of nice girls.
[1:30:22.480 --> 1:30:28.160]  What is everybody preface in front of their statement? Oh marvelous Marvin
[1:30:28.160 --> 1:30:32.280]  Hagler's family said hey he died a day after he got the shot he was totally
[1:30:32.280 --> 1:30:37.000]  held to jail then we're not saying it's a vaccine you should all get it. And Ben
[1:30:37.000 --> 1:30:40.040]  Stein's like man this is a killer I mean almost killed me I never been the sick of
[1:30:40.040 --> 1:30:43.520]  my life but I'm not saying don't take it I'm not because you might get censored I
[1:30:43.520 --> 1:30:47.720]  mean you're not you're everybody knows you're not supposed to say that. Of course
[1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:51.760]  Guillamba raised off the chart it says it's a symptom of these vaccines you've
[1:30:51.760 --> 1:30:55.720]  got all these deaths happening all the stuff unfolding all these vaccines being
[1:30:55.720 --> 1:31:00.320]  banned in India and South Africa and everywhere else but oh here in the US
[1:31:00.320 --> 1:31:06.120]  we're so bombarded with BS that everybody's got to preface it with oh
[1:31:06.120 --> 1:31:11.040]  I'm not saying I I'm not saying this is what did it I mean my son can't really
[1:31:11.040 --> 1:31:15.400]  walk very well now but that's all right we're he might die too but that's all
[1:31:15.400 --> 1:31:18.800]  right you know had nothing to do with that vaccine. It's like I was in the
[1:31:18.800 --> 1:31:23.560]  Arizona desert big old rattlesnake bites you. My leg's swelling up really hurts I'm not
[1:31:23.560 --> 1:31:28.240]  saying I'm against rattlesnakes. It's like you walk out and I'm traffic get hit by a
[1:31:28.240 --> 1:31:32.240]  truck going 50 miles an hour your back's broken your bleeding your life. I'm not
[1:31:32.240 --> 1:31:37.560]  saying that truck broke my back knocked my teeth out and I'm dying here oh god help
[1:31:37.560 --> 1:31:43.520]  me oh oh oh Elizabeth I'm coming on to you. I'm not saying the truck did it but damn
[1:31:43.520 --> 1:31:53.720]  it ran over me. I'm not I'm not against the truck though. Wow wow wow just the
[1:31:53.720 --> 1:32:01.720]  normalization of all of it which is what they talk about in spars 20 25 20 28
[1:32:01.720 --> 1:32:06.400]  the general Flynn if you just tuned in came out days ago I just learned about
[1:32:06.400 --> 1:32:10.960]  this morning and said everybody needs to see this video that Alan Jones did with
[1:32:10.960 --> 1:32:18.800]  his crew spars 20 25 20 28 at Bandai video because it's a war game of exactly
[1:32:18.800 --> 1:32:24.880]  what's happening in many cases word for word so he's the former head of
[1:32:24.880 --> 1:32:27.200]  defense intelligence former national security advisor the president of the
[1:32:27.200 --> 1:32:33.200]  United States you want to listen to him because it's all right there. So you just
[1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:37.200]  saw the local news going oh I mean you know another person paralyzed another
[1:32:37.200 --> 1:32:42.440]  person has trouble walking I mean you know it's totally normal. It's like
[1:32:42.440 --> 1:32:49.120]  Caddyshack. It's not a plus explosive or anything. Oh Mr. Gover here's some of your
[1:32:49.120 --> 1:32:56.440]  big authorities here overhead shop place this is Reuters US begin study on
[1:32:56.440 --> 1:33:00.200]  allergic reaction in Moderna Pfizer vaccines India already banned it two
[1:33:00.200 --> 1:33:05.400]  months ago oh you didn't do studies up front but you said safe and effective and
[1:33:05.400 --> 1:33:09.560]  it had been studied like when Facebook fact-checked that woman that died she
[1:33:09.560 --> 1:33:14.320]  said well you may be dead lady your family man said you died out of the we
[1:33:14.320 --> 1:33:18.840]  say it's all been tested and been proven not to hurt a damn person you know the
[1:33:18.840 --> 1:33:23.560]  insert says this untested may kill your ass but see Facebook tells you is a little
[1:33:23.560 --> 1:33:30.480]  fact check for you sweetheart all big test oh but that's Reuters they pay in
[1:33:30.480 --> 1:33:35.800]  the fine print you try to post this on Facebook they're gonna let you UK vaccine

[1:33:42.640 --> 1:33:48.880]  more than 20 countries but again it's still a conspiracy theory India South
[1:33:48.880 --> 1:33:53.720]  Africa all over all over Europe but listen listen listen just don't worry
[1:33:53.720 --> 1:33:57.880]  about that that's a conspiracy theory all right that's Reuters looking around
[1:33:57.880 --> 1:34:02.200]  here that's Reuters that's imaginary they even take the fine print you try to
[1:34:02.200 --> 1:34:08.080]  share that on Facebook or Twitter you ain't sharing Jack crap Jack

[1:38:54.120 --> 1:38:58.480]  Alex welcome would like to say first off thanks for being the voice of reason
[1:38:58.480 --> 1:39:02.160]  and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people I've been trying to get a
[1:39:02.160 --> 1:39:08.160]  hold of you for a year okay I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection
[1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:12.840]  on my lung that'll never go away living defense saved my life they had me on
[1:39:12.840 --> 1:39:17.480]  antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back
[1:39:17.480 --> 1:39:22.840]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right
[1:39:22.840 --> 1:39:29.280]  now this is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted
[1:39:29.280 --> 1:39:34.760]  and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake
[1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:39.720]  and then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate
[1:39:39.720 --> 1:39:44.160]  one another that's right where we're at brother and that's because God's name is
[1:39:44.160 --> 1:39:47.200]  on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:54.280]  enemy hates it because God created this country it's so hard for me when I'm
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:58.040]  cutting ads not get overly excited people ask me all the time they go
[1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:02.200]  children you want cocaine or you want meth how are you so excited how do I not
[1:40:02.200 --> 1:40:07.760]  get excited about world government force masks or snoculations open
[1:40:07.760 --> 1:40:12.400]  announcements that our country is gonna be dissolved I'm sorry I'm a fighter and
[1:40:12.400 --> 1:40:15.760]  I know many of you out there watching and listening are fighters as well and so
[1:40:15.760 --> 1:40:21.440]  I'll just say this I try to be calm I try to be focused I don't know what I do if

[1:40:58.720 --> 1:41:01.800]  now we have a lot of credibility but I don't care about that I care about
[1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:05.440]  beating the new world order and it's because we have so much credibility they
[1:41:05.440 --> 1:41:09.320]  can't allow us to stay on air much longer and I don't have time to tell you
[1:41:09.320 --> 1:41:12.320]  all the stuff they're doing to us for a lot of reasons I can't tell you what's
[1:41:12.320 --> 1:41:16.080]  going on but let's just say this we're gonna see this through the end we're
[1:41:16.080 --> 1:41:20.400]  gonna stay on air as long as we can so please pray for us and please buy the

[1:41:35.960 --> 1:41:39.920]  that's why the globalists are censoring they can't bring in all this tyranny and

[1:41:50.360 --> 1:42:10.360]  trying to destroy everything we ever said you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:38.800]  give me back my foot
[1:42:38.800 --> 1:42:53.800]  I saw this headline at like five o'clock this morning and it's a chill for me.
[1:42:53.800 --> 1:42:59.800]  We already knew this was coming and it's in as far as 2025-2028 report that General Quinn
[1:42:59.800 --> 1:43:02.800]  said is so important to look at.
[1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:06.800]  A third of COVID-19 survivors suffer brain disease study shows.
[1:43:06.800 --> 1:43:09.800]  Many of them had the vaccine, others didn't.
[1:43:09.800 --> 1:43:14.800]  Folks, it's the 5G, it's the chemicals, it's all of it.
[1:43:14.800 --> 1:43:19.800]  And if you don't have the vitamins and minerals you need, any of this stuff can get to you.
[1:43:19.800 --> 1:43:22.800]  And it is a weird virus, it's five different viruses.
[1:43:22.800 --> 1:43:25.800]  And it's designed to kill the weak and the old.
[1:43:25.800 --> 1:43:27.800]  That's why it's so diabolical.
[1:43:27.800 --> 1:43:30.800]  So it is a real virus, but there's ways to beat it.
[1:43:30.800 --> 1:43:33.800]  That's why they didn't want you to know about hydroxychloroquine.
[1:43:33.800 --> 1:43:35.800]  They didn't want you to know about vitamin C.
[1:43:35.800 --> 1:43:41.800]  Medical doctors were prescribing it, being SWAT team by the FBI in Texas and Michigan.
[1:43:41.800 --> 1:43:46.800]  Because they were ordered to do so.
[1:43:46.800 --> 1:43:50.800]  And all the empty hospitals and all the fraud, it's crazy.
[1:43:50.800 --> 1:43:53.800]  But I want to air this very important report.
[1:43:53.800 --> 1:44:00.800]  I know this has been out for five, six days, but DeSantis is going with the public if they want these deadly things.
[1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:03.800]  You know, he's an ABC, he'll take plenty of vaccines, he thinks it's like a normal vaccine.
[1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:05.800]  I'm not going to judge him for that.
[1:44:05.800 --> 1:44:08.800]  He says that it shouldn't be mandatory and there shouldn't be vaccine passports.
[1:44:08.800 --> 1:44:10.800]  But if you want it, get it.
[1:44:10.800 --> 1:44:17.800]  And then they already put it in Walgreens, they already put it in CVS first and then other places bid to get it.
[1:44:17.800 --> 1:44:21.800]  Has nothing to do with publics donating to his campaign.
[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:23.800]  But 60 minutes cut that out.
[1:44:23.800 --> 1:44:24.800]  Well, now it's blown up in their face.
[1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:28.800]  So I'm watching Fox News this morning after I get off National Journal.
[1:44:28.800 --> 1:44:30.800]  I did a few segments with Eric to spit this morning.
[1:44:30.800 --> 1:44:35.800]  And then they're getting another cup of coffee before I went across the road and worked out.
[1:44:35.800 --> 1:44:42.800]  And they're saying, well, 60 minutes CVS released a news report.
[1:44:42.800 --> 1:44:51.800]  We released this because black people are having as likely to have the vaccine in Broward County.
[1:44:51.800 --> 1:44:54.800]  And this racist DeSantis won't give to the black people.
[1:44:54.800 --> 1:44:59.800]  Now, everybody knows black people are smart when it comes to a lot of things,
[1:44:59.800 --> 1:45:05.800]  but certainly not taking vaccines for long history of testing and the illnesses that Hank Aaron dying and Marvel's Marvin Hagler.
[1:45:05.800 --> 1:45:09.800]  And I mean, some's going on this vaccine where it really messes up black people.
[1:45:09.800 --> 1:45:11.800]  It's bad for everybody.
[1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:16.800]  But it's like fluoride, hydrophilicic acid studies just plies just bad for black people.
[1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:20.800]  Because there's differences in the groups, folks, like differences in different breeds of dogs or cows or anything.
[1:45:20.800 --> 1:45:22.800]  We're all dogs, we're all cows, but we're different.
[1:45:22.800 --> 1:45:24.800]  Hell, I'm different to my cousins.
[1:45:24.800 --> 1:45:25.800]  They're white.
[1:45:25.800 --> 1:45:27.800]  You get what I'm saying.
[1:45:27.800 --> 1:45:32.800]  So you get the vaccine, I got the vaccine, they got the vaccine, you got DMC.
[1:45:32.800 --> 1:45:39.800]  All these people pushing this crap and they admit blacks won't take it.
[1:45:39.800 --> 1:45:41.800]  And so they're on the news going to Santos.
[1:45:41.800 --> 1:45:43.800]  The blacks haven't had it because of DeSantis.
[1:45:43.800 --> 1:45:48.800]  He wouldn't give it to them hoping to trick blacks to go, well, that white supremacist, I'm going to get out.
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:50.800]  I'm going to get that shot right now.
[1:45:50.800 --> 1:45:52.800]  Devil isn't going to give it to me.
[1:45:52.800 --> 1:45:54.800]  I mean, this is what they're doing everywhere.
[1:45:54.800 --> 1:45:58.800]  The level of deception within deception is insane.
[1:45:58.800 --> 1:46:02.800]  So here's what DeSantis really said.
[1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:07.800]  First, you'll see the 60 minutes at it and you'll see what he really said in a hanger full of news cameras.
[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:09.800]  They're so arrogant they still engage in this deception.
[1:46:09.800 --> 1:46:11.800]  Here it is.
[1:46:11.800 --> 1:46:17.800]  We wanted to ask Governor DeSantis about the deal, but he declined our request for an interview.
[1:46:17.800 --> 1:46:19.800]  We caught up with them south of Orlando.
[1:46:19.800 --> 1:46:23.800]  Public, as you know, donated $100,000 to your campaign.
[1:46:23.800 --> 1:46:28.800]  And then you rewarded them with the exclusive rights to distribute the vaccination in Palm Beach.
[1:46:28.800 --> 1:46:30.800]  So first of all, what you're saying is wrong.
[1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:31.800]  How is that not paid to play?
[1:46:31.800 --> 1:46:32.800]  That's a fake narrative.
[1:46:32.800 --> 1:46:34.800]  I met with the county mayor.
[1:46:34.800 --> 1:46:35.800]  I met with the administrator.
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:37.800]  I met with all the folks at Palm Beach County.
[1:46:37.800 --> 1:46:39.800]  And I said, here's some of the options.
[1:46:39.800 --> 1:46:41.800]  We can do more drive-through sites.
[1:46:41.800 --> 1:46:42.800]  We can give more to hospitals.
[1:46:42.800 --> 1:46:43.800]  We can do the publics.
[1:46:43.800 --> 1:46:47.800]  And they said, we think that would be the easiest thing for our residents.
[1:46:47.800 --> 1:46:54.800]  But Melissa McKinlay, the county commissioner in the Glades, told us the governor never met with her about the public's deal.
[1:46:54.800 --> 1:46:56.800]  The criticism is that it's paid to play, Governor.
[1:46:56.800 --> 1:46:57.800]  It's wrong.
[1:46:57.800 --> 1:46:58.800]  It's wrong.
[1:46:58.800 --> 1:46:59.800]  It's a fake narrative.
[1:46:59.800 --> 1:47:01.800]  I just disabused you of the narrative.
[1:47:01.800 --> 1:47:06.800]  And you don't care about the facts because, obviously, I laid it out for you in a way that is irrefutable.
[1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:08.800]  And so it's clearly not.
[1:47:08.800 --> 1:47:09.800]  Isn't there the nearest public to the public?
[1:47:09.800 --> 1:47:10.800]  No, no, no.
[1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:11.800]  You're wrong.
[1:47:11.800 --> 1:47:12.800]  You're wrong.
[1:47:12.800 --> 1:47:13.800]  You're wrong.
[1:47:13.800 --> 1:47:14.800]  That's actually a fact.
[1:47:14.800 --> 1:47:19.800]  So first of all, what you're saying is wrong.
[1:47:19.800 --> 1:47:21.800]  That's a fake narrative.
[1:47:21.800 --> 1:47:28.800]  So first of all, when we did the first pharmacies that had it were CVS and Walgreens, and they had a long-term care mission.
[1:47:28.800 --> 1:47:31.800]  So they were going to the long-term care facilities.
[1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:33.800]  They got vaccine in the middle of December.
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:39.800]  They started going to the long-term care facilities the third week of December to do LTCs.
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:40.800]  So that was their mission.
[1:47:40.800 --> 1:47:41.800]  That was very important.
[1:47:41.800 --> 1:47:43.800]  And we trusted them to do that.
[1:47:43.800 --> 1:47:47.800]  As we got into January, we wanted to expand the distribution points.
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:49.800]  So yes, you had the counties.
[1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:50.800]  You had some drive-through sites.
[1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:52.800]  You had hospitals that were doing a lot.
[1:47:52.800 --> 1:47:54.800]  But we wanted to get it into communities more.
[1:47:54.800 --> 1:47:58.800]  So we reached out to other retail pharmacies, Publix, Walmart.
[1:47:58.800 --> 1:48:01.800]  Obviously CVS and Walgreens had to finish that mission.
[1:48:01.800 --> 1:48:04.800]  And we said, we're going to use you as soon as you're done with that.
[1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:08.800]  For the Publix, they were the first one to raise their hands and say they were ready to go.
[1:48:08.800 --> 1:48:09.800]  And you know what?
[1:48:09.800 --> 1:48:11.800]  We did it on a trial basis.
[1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:13.800]  I had three counties.
[1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:17.800]  I actually showed up that weekend and talked to seniors across four different Publix.
[1:48:17.800 --> 1:48:18.800]  How was the experience?
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:19.800]  Is this good?
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:21.800]  Do you think this is the way to go?
[1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:23.800]  And it was 100% positive.
[1:48:23.800 --> 1:48:26.800]  So we expanded it, and then folks liked it.
[1:48:26.800 --> 1:48:29.800]  And I can tell you, if you look at a place like Palm Beach County,
[1:48:29.800 --> 1:48:33.800]  they were kind of struggling at first in terms of the senior numbers.
[1:48:33.800 --> 1:48:34.800]  I went.
[1:48:34.800 --> 1:48:35.800]  I met with the county mayor.
[1:48:35.800 --> 1:48:36.800]  I met with the administrator.
[1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:38.800]  I met with all the folks at Palm Beach County.
[1:48:38.800 --> 1:48:40.800]  And I said, here's some of the options.
[1:48:40.800 --> 1:48:42.800]  We can do more drive-thru sites.
[1:48:42.800 --> 1:48:43.800]  We can give more to hospitals.
[1:48:43.800 --> 1:48:45.800]  We can do the Publix.
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:46.800]  We can do this.
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:51.800]  They calculated that 90% of their seniors live within a mile and a half of a Publix.
[1:48:51.800 --> 1:48:54.800]  And they said, we think that would be the easiest thing for our residents.
[1:48:54.800 --> 1:48:55.800]  So we did that.
[1:48:55.800 --> 1:48:59.800]  And what ended up happening was yet 65 Publix in Palm Beach.
[1:48:59.800 --> 1:49:03.800]  Palm Beach is one of the biggest counties, one of the most elderly counties.
[1:49:03.800 --> 1:49:07.800]  We've done almost 75% of the seniors in Palm Beach.
[1:49:07.800 --> 1:49:09.800]  And the reason is because you have the strong retail footprint.
[1:49:09.800 --> 1:49:13.800]  So our way has been multifaceted.
[1:49:13.800 --> 1:49:14.800]  It has worked.
[1:49:14.800 --> 1:49:19.800]  And we're also now very much expanding CVS and Walgreens now that they've completed the
[1:49:19.800 --> 1:49:20.800]  long-term care mission.
[1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:21.800]  Yes.
[1:49:21.800 --> 1:49:22.800]  And it's wrong.
[1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:23.800]  It's wrong.
[1:49:23.800 --> 1:49:24.800]  It's a fake narrative.
[1:49:24.800 --> 1:49:26.800]  I just disabused you of the narrative.
[1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:31.800]  And you don't care about the facts because obviously I laid it out for you in a way that is irrefutable.
[1:49:31.800 --> 1:49:33.800]  And so it's clearly not.
[1:49:33.800 --> 1:49:35.800]  No, no, no, you're wrong.
[1:49:35.800 --> 1:49:41.800]  Now, I have a five-minute clip of Fox News this morning where CVS now says, the Sanctus
[1:49:41.800 --> 1:49:44.800]  is a racist that kept the black people from the shots.
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:48.800]  Total horse crap, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:49:48.800 --> 1:49:52.800]  And if people want to go take the shots, knock yourselves out.
[1:49:52.800 --> 1:49:54.800]  But it's associated with Alzheimer's, everything else.
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:56.800]  And I'm not going to attack the Sanis for that.
[1:49:56.800 --> 1:49:57.800]  This is a big cultural movement.
[1:49:57.800 --> 1:49:58.800]  Publix buying into it.
[1:49:58.800 --> 1:49:59.800]  Some of them.
[1:49:59.800 --> 1:50:00.800]  That's your issue.
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:05.800]  The point is, is that that's how they attack at every level to fetishize the vaccine.
[1:50:05.800 --> 1:50:08.800]  Oh, the Sanis wouldn't let you have it.
[1:50:08.800 --> 1:50:15.800]  Oh, he did it to the Publix people, cut all the money, and none of it is based in reality.
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:18.800]  In fact, they set up front in the media.
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:23.800]  We love black people so much that it's not just old people get it.
[1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:24.800]  Not as the old people.
[1:50:24.800 --> 1:50:26.800]  We've been killing these nursing homes.
[1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:29.800]  But black people, we love you so much.
[1:50:29.800 --> 1:50:30.800]  We love you to you first.
[1:50:30.800 --> 1:50:33.800]  And you don't think black people got a big old shiver up their spine?
[1:50:33.800 --> 1:50:37.800]  Like, especially to me, I'm going to give you a deal because I like you so much.
[1:50:37.800 --> 1:50:39.800]  And you've got a history of screwing me over.
[1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:40.800]  I'm not taking that deal.
[1:50:40.800 --> 1:50:41.800]  What the hell you think?
[1:50:41.800 --> 1:50:44.800]  I mean, this is, that's why I think these people are aliens or something.
[1:50:44.800 --> 1:50:45.800]  These globalists, man.
[1:50:45.800 --> 1:50:48.800]  Because some of the stuff they do is smart, but other things is so stupid.
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:51.800]  Like anybody, I love black people so much.
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:52.800]  We need the black.
[1:50:52.800 --> 1:50:55.800]  This is like, it's like eight months ago before the vaccine even came out.
[1:50:55.800 --> 1:50:58.800]  They're like, we need the black people to take this.
[1:50:58.800 --> 1:51:00.800]  We really love you, Hank Aaron.
[1:51:00.800 --> 1:51:02.800]  We really love you, Marvis Marvin.
[1:51:02.800 --> 1:51:06.800]  Now, then we're going to have black people give you the shot.
[1:51:06.800 --> 1:51:07.800]  Okay.
[1:51:07.800 --> 1:51:08.800]  All right.
[1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:10.800]  And I'm going to say this again.
[1:51:10.800 --> 1:51:14.800]  If you're a black person, particularly, you need a lot more sun than a white person.
[1:51:14.800 --> 1:51:18.800]  So if you're wearing sweaters and staying in all doors and old person, you're dead if
[1:51:18.800 --> 1:51:19.800]  you're a black person.
[1:51:19.800 --> 1:51:24.800]  If you're not taking absorbable, organic vitamins and minerals.
[1:51:24.800 --> 1:51:26.800]  If it's essential, that means it's essential.
[1:51:26.800 --> 1:51:28.800]  Essential means you got to have it.
[1:51:28.800 --> 1:51:31.800]  And I know everybody gets this, but our listeners better tell everybody.
[1:51:31.800 --> 1:51:35.800]  And one thing getting the COVID numbers down and defeating them and exposing it is everybody's
[1:51:35.800 --> 1:51:38.800]  going out and they're taking care of themselves and they're getting essential vitamins and
[1:51:38.800 --> 1:51:39.800]  minerals.
[1:51:39.800 --> 1:51:41.800]  And it's pissing, fouching, and the global saw.
[1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:45.800]  Because if you have vitamin D, if you have zinc, if you have C, you're basically bullet
[1:51:45.800 --> 1:51:47.800]  proof and these bastards can't get you.
[1:51:47.800 --> 1:51:51.800]  And they are so angry because they don't want to pay out the pension funds of all these
[1:51:51.800 --> 1:51:52.800]  old people.
[1:51:52.800 --> 1:51:54.800]  They don't care whether you're black or white.
[1:51:54.800 --> 1:51:56.800]  They want to get your ass.
[1:51:56.800 --> 1:52:00.800]  But you have a special little hatred for black people.
[1:52:00.800 --> 1:52:03.800]  That's why they go, oh, we love the black people.
[1:52:03.800 --> 1:52:09.800]  All these TV ads and movies and any corporate ad for 5G or hard liquor.
[1:52:09.800 --> 1:52:11.800]  It's nothing but black people now.
[1:52:11.800 --> 1:52:15.800]  And because the corporations are like taking on the identity of black people.
[1:52:15.800 --> 1:52:17.800]  Like, Apple is now a black guy.
[1:52:17.800 --> 1:52:19.800]  It's all right if I run death camps in China.
[1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:22.800]  And, you know, whiskey is now black.
[1:52:22.800 --> 1:52:24.800]  So it's all right if you get liver cancer.
[1:52:24.800 --> 1:52:27.800]  And it's just like, I mean, everybody sees it.
[1:52:27.800 --> 1:52:30.800]  And it's just the global is trying on some camouflage.
[1:52:30.800 --> 1:52:31.800]  It's weird.
[1:52:31.800 --> 1:52:33.800]  So if I was black, I'd be worried.
[1:52:33.800 --> 1:52:35.800]  Hell, I don't care what color you'd be worried.
[1:52:35.800 --> 1:52:37.800]  Because a new world order is here to kill, still destroy.
[1:52:37.800 --> 1:52:40.800]  Stay with us hour number three.
[1:52:40.800 --> 1:52:43.800]  The equation is very simple.
[1:52:43.800 --> 1:52:45.800]  The mega banks control the media.
[1:52:45.800 --> 1:52:47.800]  They control big pharma.
[1:52:47.800 --> 1:52:49.800]  They control academia.
[1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:52.800]  They control the military, industrial complex.
[1:52:52.800 --> 1:52:54.800]  They control big tech.
[1:52:54.800 --> 1:52:58.800]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world,
[1:52:58.800 --> 1:53:03.800]  they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[1:53:03.800 --> 1:53:08.800]  It is the western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery
[1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:12.800]  and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[1:53:12.800 --> 1:53:15.800]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic,
[1:53:15.800 --> 1:53:20.800]  they instead co-opt and turn it upside down and use the idea of equality
[1:53:20.800 --> 1:53:27.800]  to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[1:53:27.800 --> 1:53:32.800]  That's why they target info wars, because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:37.800]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:41.800]  So redouble your efforts. We're all in this together.
[1:53:41.800 --> 1:53:45.800]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health.
[1:53:45.800 --> 1:53:50.800]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems,
[1:53:50.800 --> 1:53:56.800]  including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration and even a weakened immune system.
[1:53:56.800 --> 1:54:02.800]  Introducing Rocket Rest, the new product from our Dr. Jones naturals line at infowarstore.com.

[1:54:10.800 --> 1:54:14.800]  Many competitor sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep,
[1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:20.800]  but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day.
[1:54:20.800 --> 1:54:26.800]  It uses a unique quick release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients
[1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:28.800]  like melatonin and magnesium.

[1:54:33.800 --> 1:54:40.800]  So get the new Rocket Rest formula from Dr. Jones naturals right now at infowarstore.com.
[1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:06.800]  Oh, that sounds devilish.
[1:55:24.800 --> 1:55:29.800]  Shall we have a little fun, folks? Will you join me in laughing at our stupid world?
[1:55:29.800 --> 1:55:35.800]  Coca-Cola is one of the companies that opposes the Georgia voter integrity law
[1:55:35.800 --> 1:55:38.800]  and is making it known, and of course they're headquartered in Atlanta
[1:55:38.800 --> 1:55:44.800]  and are threatening to pull out potentially tens of millions of dollars from the state
[1:55:44.800 --> 1:55:50.800]  if they do not submit to the legislative extortion that's being leveled against them.
[1:55:50.800 --> 1:55:56.800]  Meanwhile, have you ever seen the Coca-Cola advertisement from 1936
[1:55:56.800 --> 1:55:59.800]  advertising their partnership with Nazi Germany?
[1:55:59.800 --> 1:56:02.800]  These are good people.
[1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:05.800]  Very decent people, the people of Coca-Cola.
[1:56:05.800 --> 1:56:12.800]  The best part about this, look at that saying in German, it's one people, one country, one drink.
[1:56:12.800 --> 1:56:14.800]  Coke it is.
[1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:17.800]  Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Gehrtrank.
[1:56:17.800 --> 1:56:18.800]  Coke it is.
[1:56:18.800 --> 1:56:20.800]  Drink Coke.
[1:56:20.800 --> 1:56:22.800]  Hail Coke.
[1:56:22.800 --> 1:56:24.800]  One people.
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:27.800]  One photo.
[1:56:27.800 --> 1:56:30.800]  Oh, it's stupid beyond belief, but there it is.
[1:56:30.800 --> 1:56:34.800]  How goofy is that? Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Gehrtrank.
[1:56:34.800 --> 1:56:36.800]  Coke it is.
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:38.800]  It is Coke.
[1:56:38.800 --> 1:56:42.800]  We come together with Coke.
[1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:49.800]  All right, so as we're moving towards right, this is the role that corporations have played for all the time.
[1:56:49.800 --> 1:56:54.800]  Let me explain what's going on here. You have now innumerable numbers of massive corporations,
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:56:58.800]  major league baseball, moving the All-Star Game from Atlanta to Denver,
[1:56:58.800 --> 1:57:03.800]  depriving the people of Georgia of potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue generated
[1:57:03.800 --> 1:57:08.800]  by that game, the media attention, and all of the surrounding festivities around it.
[1:57:08.800 --> 1:57:12.800]  They're pulling out because Georgia passed a law they didn't like.
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:19.800]  The legislature debated the bills, organized it, are exerting the will of the people of Georgia,
[1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:22.800]  but it's not the will of the people of Georgia that matters anymore.
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:25.800]  It's what the corporations demand, and this is what we're learning.
[1:57:25.800 --> 1:57:29.800]  And so finally, because of the egregious actions that they're involved in,
[1:57:29.800 --> 1:57:34.800]  there's also the Civic Alliance that's 200 companies, including, I think, Under Armour, Nike,
[1:57:34.800 --> 1:57:41.800]  just a ton of massive, massive manufacturers, food service just from any and all areas of industry
[1:57:41.800 --> 1:57:45.800]  coming out against the will of the people.
[1:57:45.800 --> 1:57:49.800]  You actually even have McConnell, as New York Times puts it,
[1:57:49.800 --> 1:57:54.800]  a long-aid defender of corporate speech now suggests executives stay out of politics.
[1:57:54.800 --> 1:58:01.800]  So even corporate drones like Mitch McConnell are starting to understand the threat that corporations pose.
[1:58:01.800 --> 1:58:05.800]  I think what they maybe don't understand is that this is not random.
[1:58:05.800 --> 1:58:09.800]  It's not just happening because cancel culture is influencing companies.
[1:58:09.800 --> 1:58:13.800]  There's a lot of people going, Major League Baseball caved to the mob.
[1:58:13.800 --> 1:58:15.800]  No, no, no. This is not cancel culture.
[1:58:15.800 --> 1:58:22.800]  This is not a bottom-to-top impulse where these corporations are being forced by a huge crowd of people.
[1:58:22.800 --> 1:58:25.800]  This is a top-to-bottom censorship issue.
[1:58:25.800 --> 1:58:28.800]  This is a top-to-bottom extortion issue.
[1:58:28.800 --> 1:58:32.800]  This is an issue of the largest corporations, the richest people in the world,
[1:58:32.800 --> 1:58:36.800]  exerting their financial power to override the will of the American people
[1:58:36.800 --> 1:58:39.800]  and convert American democracy to its very core.
[1:58:39.800 --> 1:58:41.800]  What they don't maybe realize...
[1:58:41.800 --> 1:58:44.800]  That's right, folks. That's part of a report Harrison did live this morning.
[1:58:44.800 --> 1:58:49.800]  I wanted to air that is, of course, American Journal weekday mornings at 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.
[1:58:49.800 --> 1:58:54.800]  right before us with Harrison Smith and the other great co-hosts that joined him as well, like myself.
[1:58:54.800 --> 1:58:57.800]  This morning it just went live at Band-Aid Video Corporate Influences,
[1:58:57.800 --> 1:58:59.800]  a core component of the great reset.
[1:58:59.800 --> 1:59:02.800]  It's beyond core. It is corporate, global governance.
[1:59:02.800 --> 1:59:06.800]  It hates small businesses, small communities, small farmers, and small churches.
[1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:09.800]  And I'm looking, if you're a TV viewer, you can see on the push-up screen,
[1:59:09.800 --> 1:59:14.800]  the surreal footage breaking police-rated put-up fences around Alberta Church
[1:59:14.800 --> 1:59:17.800]  that defies lockdown. The pastor is in jail.
[1:59:17.800 --> 1:59:21.800]  You can see behind her a bunch of police out there, like they're raiding an al-Qaeda base.
[1:59:21.800 --> 1:59:25.800]  They've put a taxpayer-paid-for fence up around so they can't meet there.
[1:59:25.800 --> 1:59:27.800]  Think that'll make the church stronger or weaker?
[1:59:27.800 --> 1:59:32.800]  I say stronger. That which does not kill you only makes you stronger.
[1:59:32.800 --> 1:59:36.800]  We're going to talk to Sheila Gunn-Reed on the other side
[1:59:36.800 --> 1:59:42.800]  with live feeds from on the ground of the globalist COVID-19 antichrist takeover.
[1:59:42.800 --> 1:59:44.800]  Margaret, the big stay with us.
[1:59:44.800 --> 1:59:49.800]  We're going to talk to Sheila Gunn-Reed.
[2:00:14.800 --> 2:00:19.800]  My skin is just really gorgeous, actually. People think I'm 55 years old.
[2:00:19.800 --> 2:00:23.800]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know,
[2:00:23.800 --> 2:00:27.800]  well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation.
[2:00:27.800 --> 2:00:31.800]  But when I started taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately.
[2:00:31.800 --> 2:00:34.800]  But, you know, over a period of time, I started noticing,
[2:00:34.800 --> 2:00:38.800]  okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful.
[2:00:38.800 --> 2:00:43.800]  You know, I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know.
[2:00:43.800 --> 2:00:48.800]  Anyway, it worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:20.800]  We are now 14 months into the U.N. Bill Gates directed COVID fraud.
[2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:26.800]  And from Germany to the U.K. to areas the U.S., Australia, New Zealand and Canada,
[2:01:26.800 --> 2:01:36.800]  churches and small businesses, restaurants, bars, gyms are closed in many areas or 25%.
[2:01:36.800 --> 2:01:41.800]  And here's the big headline. It's all over the news in Canada.
[2:01:41.800 --> 2:01:44.800]  So they're saying it's a good thing. The pastor is in jail.
[2:01:44.800 --> 2:01:50.800]  Police raid and put fences up around Alberta church that defied lockdown orders.
[2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:54.800]  So now they can just, I guess, meet outside by the fence. I predict it will be even bigger.
[2:01:54.800 --> 2:02:00.800]  Imagine the money. Dozens, they watched the footage all day of vehicles, SUVs,
[2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:07.800]  workers, police, more than dozens, putting up a giant fence around a church that looks like
[2:02:07.800 --> 2:02:11.800]  you could have indoor basketball stadium and a whole school.
[2:02:11.800 --> 2:02:15.800]  Looks like a middle school or something. This is incredible.
[2:02:15.800 --> 2:02:22.800]  This is the hunger of the system to target Christians. Absolutely incredible in all this money to do this.
[2:02:22.800 --> 2:02:25.800]  Remember weeks ago, we had Ezra LeVan on from Rebel News.
[2:02:25.800 --> 2:02:29.800]  They had thrown footage of what was going on there and how they were all waiting.
[2:02:29.800 --> 2:02:31.800]  And now they're showing everybody who the boss is.
[2:02:31.800 --> 2:02:35.800]  My, how Europe is falling, how the U.K. is falling, how Canada is falling.
[2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:40.800]  And incredible. But the Black Lives Matter, Communist March, with no mask, it's wonderful.
[2:02:40.800 --> 2:02:46.800]  Just simply insane. Sheila Gunn-Reed is a chief reporter at Rebel News and her primary focus
[2:02:46.800 --> 2:02:50.800]  are government accountability, civil liberties and religious freedom, rebelnews.com.
[2:02:50.800 --> 2:02:56.800]  Sheila Gunn-Reed on Twitter. Sheila, thank you so much for joining us.
[2:02:56.800 --> 2:03:03.800]  You're right there live. Tell us what's unfolded in this latest, just over the top, bizarro escalation.
[2:03:03.800 --> 2:03:09.800]  Well, Alex, thank you so much for your interest in this and the interest in the other side of the story.
[2:03:09.800 --> 2:03:17.800]  What happened this morning is that at dawn, approximately 6 a.m. at least according to security footage
[2:03:17.800 --> 2:03:25.800]  I received from church elders, the RCMP, so our federal police force and Alberta Health Services.
[2:03:25.800 --> 2:03:32.800]  That's the provincial health authority here and some private security contractors as well as some private
[2:03:32.800 --> 2:03:39.800]  construction contractors rolled onto church property here and started erecting not just one fence,
[2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:46.800]  but two high security fences. You can see the security fence behind me in the shot here.
[2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:53.800]  They erected two of those and then wrapped one of those in a black plastic sarcophagus
[2:03:53.800 --> 2:03:57.800]  as to obscure that this was ever even a church in the first place.
[2:03:57.800 --> 2:04:02.800]  That's right. I see that in the background. There's like a black veil over it.
[2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:08.800]  Yes. Like they've isolated a virus or something.
[2:04:08.800 --> 2:04:14.800]  Well, that's exactly it. This church has openly defied the lockdown restrictions here in the province of Alberta.
[2:04:14.800 --> 2:04:18.800]  The lockdown restrictions limit places of worship.
[2:04:18.800 --> 2:04:27.800]  So all places of worship to just 15 percent of fire code capacity also requires places of worship to enforce social
[2:04:27.800 --> 2:04:34.800]  distancing of six feet spacing between congregants as well as mandating masks on worshipers.
[2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:39.800]  They are also not allowed to play instruments or sing in church.
[2:04:39.800 --> 2:04:47.800]  That church has done none of this. They say that those public health orders directly violate their right to practice their religion as they see fit.
[2:04:47.800 --> 2:04:51.800]  And they've openly defied them. Now, I'm sure that you're aware.
[2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:59.800]  And I know that you've spoken to my boss Ezra Levant about the just absolutely brutal crackdown on churches here in my province.
[2:04:59.800 --> 2:05:09.800]  Pastor James Coates, the pastor here was taken into provincial custody and held at a maximum security provincial jail for 35 days.
[2:05:09.800 --> 2:05:14.800]  A prisoner of conscience for violating those public health orders.
[2:05:14.800 --> 2:05:21.800]  He did qualify for bail, but his bail conditions required him not only to abide by the public health orders at the church,
[2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:27.800]  but to also not even attend a church that doesn't adhere to the public health order.
[2:05:27.800 --> 2:05:32.800]  So he remained in jail until a deal could be struck for his release.
[2:05:32.800 --> 2:05:39.800]  That's the kind of brutal crackdown that religious people and people of all faith backgrounds are facing here in Alberta.
[2:05:39.800 --> 2:05:49.800]  We like to fancy ourselves as Canada's Texas, one of the freest places really on the continent from the lockdown.
[2:05:49.800 --> 2:05:53.800]  The targeted focus has been on churches.
[2:05:53.800 --> 2:06:04.800]  Retail is allowed double people in attendance in retail space as are the churches here in Alberta.
[2:06:04.800 --> 2:06:13.800]  Well, as we sit here watching this, did you see the footage out of Calgary where they went to the small church and tried to shut it down?
[2:06:13.800 --> 2:06:16.800]  The man said, get out of here, get out of here, get out of here, the Polish immigrant.
[2:06:16.800 --> 2:06:21.800]  I mean, I would expect to see that from the public. Everybody's going to the grocery store, they're going to the mall.
[2:06:21.800 --> 2:06:25.800]  There's literally all over the world a fetish with attacking churches.
[2:06:25.800 --> 2:06:32.800]  You've seen the UK, haven't you, where they go on a good Friday, they go to Easter, they shut it.
[2:06:32.800 --> 2:06:34.800]  I mean, these people are sick.
[2:06:34.800 --> 2:06:42.800]  That footage there from that church in Calgary, again, my oppressive province of Alberta, that was Pastor Art Poloski.
[2:06:42.800 --> 2:06:46.800]  And Art Poloski has been a vocal opponent of the lockdown.
[2:06:46.800 --> 2:06:55.800]  He has been, I mean, absolutely attacked by the state for standing up against the lockdown.
[2:06:55.800 --> 2:07:04.800]  At Rebel News, we have an initiative called Fight the Fines, and we help people at no cost to them fight their lockdown tickets in court.
[2:07:04.800 --> 2:07:09.800]  We crowdfund that. If people would like to donate to that, it's our largest civil liberties project to date.
[2:07:09.800 --> 2:07:20.800]  But Pastor Art in Calgary was our very first Fight the Fines client on a brutally cold Alberta winter day.
[2:07:20.800 --> 2:07:25.800]  So absolutely frozen, minus 40.
[2:07:25.800 --> 2:07:35.800]  He was out feeding the homeless, and he received a $1,200 lockdown ticket for what the police called that day an illegal gathering.
[2:07:35.800 --> 2:07:40.800]  So it's cold, people are hungry, they're homeless.
[2:07:40.800 --> 2:07:47.800]  And Pastor Art was out there doing the Lord's work, literally, and he was issued a lockdown ticket.
[2:07:47.800 --> 2:07:55.800]  In fact, now over the course of the pandemic, Pastor Art has received 28 or so lockdown tickets.
[2:07:55.800 --> 2:07:59.800]  We've successfully had a few of those tossed out in court, and we'll continue to help Pastor Art fight.
[2:07:59.800 --> 2:08:07.800]  But Pastor Art, you know, he's dealing with the lockdown in his own way.
[2:08:07.800 --> 2:08:17.800]  He's in jail for weeks for not agreeing to not run his church anymore, and the lockdowns are never going to end.
[2:08:17.800 --> 2:08:23.800]  It's an endless lockdown, planned to bankrupt all the small businesses, all the churches, everything.
[2:08:23.800 --> 2:08:27.800]  And these police are just following these orders. It's truly disgusting.
[2:08:27.800 --> 2:08:33.800]  We saw Chris Scott get a visit late at night with over 30 police cars to his house.
[2:08:33.800 --> 2:08:38.800]  They said, oh, we saw you at the grocery store, not wearing a mask. I mean, this is a sick cult.
[2:08:38.800 --> 2:08:46.800]  Yeah, Chris Scott is actually, we reported on it very recently that Chris Scott is now on a no fly list.
[2:08:46.800 --> 2:09:01.800]  So in Canada here, Omar Cotter, the convicted self-professed al-Qaeda terrorist who killed US servicemen Chris Spear.
[2:09:01.800 --> 2:09:06.800]  And he was held in Gitmo for quite some time. He is not on a no fly list in Canada.
[2:09:06.800 --> 2:09:12.800]  My boss actually encountered him in an airport in Canada, and that's how we know he's not on a no fly list.
[2:09:12.800 --> 2:09:23.800]  And yet someone like Chris Sky, who's an advocate for civil liberties and for being able to conduct your business mask free, he's the guy who's on a no fly list.
[2:09:23.800 --> 2:09:27.800]  Things are completely upside down here in Canada.
[2:09:27.800 --> 2:09:33.800]  Well, your own prime minister said he wants a dictatorship like China. He said that's the system he wants.
[2:09:33.800 --> 2:09:38.800]  I mean, this is public. Is the average Canadian liking this? Do they want to go bankrupt?
[2:09:38.800 --> 2:09:41.800]  And I mean, do they understand they're not going to get a paycheck forever?
[2:09:41.800 --> 2:09:45.800]  This is about a universal income, about getting everybody on welfare.
[2:09:45.800 --> 2:09:53.800]  You know, I think the average Canadian is, frankly, too scared when they see what happens to a church here in Canada.
[2:09:53.800 --> 2:09:59.800]  And when they see tickets being issued to people like Pastor Art Pelosi and Calgary for just feeding the homeless,
[2:09:59.800 --> 2:10:08.800]  when they see protesters in Montreal tackled, shoved to the ground, protesters in Toronto, same thing, tackled and shoved to the ground,
[2:10:08.800 --> 2:10:19.800]  when they see my own journalists here at Rebel News being issued lockdown tickets for trying to report on the oppressive nature of the police in Montreal.
[2:10:19.800 --> 2:10:27.800]  We've had even clients through Fight the Fines, Hasidic Jews and Orthodox Jews, praying in their synagogues,
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:30.800]  and their synagogues are being raided on a Saturday night.
[2:10:30.800 --> 2:10:33.800]  And whether it's Australia, Canada or the U.S., it's the same. It's a global blueprint.
[2:10:33.800 --> 2:10:37.800]  Now, now, I can see you're there with a crowd. I can hear a crowd of the reporters right near you.
[2:10:37.800 --> 2:10:41.800]  Maybe you can turn the camera around. We can show those folks we come back just to show the crowd that's there,
[2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:43.800]  because I can obviously hear them. It sounds like a sports stadium.
[2:10:43.800 --> 2:10:49.800]  And then I want to maybe have you walk down a little bit, unless they're going to arrest you.
[2:10:49.800 --> 2:10:57.800]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[2:10:57.800 --> 2:11:05.800]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[2:11:05.800 --> 2:11:08.800]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[2:11:08.800 --> 2:11:14.800]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other major service,
[2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:16.800]  they've got it all and they're expanding.
[2:11:16.800 --> 2:11:23.800]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the lowest price
[2:11:23.800 --> 2:11:29.800]  and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war.
[2:11:29.800 --> 2:11:34.800]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them.
[2:11:34.800 --> 2:11:41.800]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[2:11:41.800 --> 2:11:45.800]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there.
[2:11:45.800 --> 2:11:48.800]  infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[2:11:48.800 --> 2:11:56.800]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is a remarkable product and it's back in stock 40% off at infowarstore.com right now.

[2:12:36.800 --> 2:12:38.800]  We're going to keep the quality at the highest levels.
[2:12:38.800 --> 2:12:39.800]  It also funds the InfoWars.
[2:12:39.800 --> 2:12:55.800]  So get your vitamin mineral fusion now at infowarstore.com or AAA 2533139.
[2:13:10.800 --> 2:13:13.800]  Well, it's happened.
[2:13:13.800 --> 2:13:19.800]  Canada has joined Communist China in shutting down churches coast to coast using the COVID hoax to do it.
[2:13:19.800 --> 2:13:22.800]  I was talking to Rebel Media reporter Sheila Gunn-Reed.
[2:13:22.800 --> 2:13:25.800]  During the break, the police came over and told her to move.
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:27.800]  There's a crowd of about 50 people there.
[2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:33.800]  Maybe she could pan around and show that and then she agreed to go up and talk to these goon-like police in the middle of the field.
[2:13:33.800 --> 2:13:42.800]  Looks like there are 150 yards from the church. It has black, for radio listeners, big black tarps up around it like it's satanic.
[2:13:42.800 --> 2:13:46.800]  So tell us what just happened and then you've got the floor here.
[2:13:46.800 --> 2:13:50.800]  You just do the interview, conduct it, go talk to the police. You name it, please.
[2:13:50.800 --> 2:13:55.800]  Sure. So the police are doing what they've done all day here.
[2:13:55.800 --> 2:14:00.800]  Not only are they keeping the congregants away from the church itself,
[2:14:00.800 --> 2:14:03.800]  but they're keeping everybody off church property.
[2:14:03.800 --> 2:14:08.800]  So the adjacent property here where I'm standing is actually owned by a member of the church.
[2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:11.800]  So this is where everybody's corralled.
[2:14:11.800 --> 2:14:16.800]  And maybe we can head over there and you guys can walk down the road.
[2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:21.800]  It's a right away. The police can't stop you on a right away, even though they've seized the property. Go ahead.
[2:14:21.800 --> 2:14:24.800]  Wow. Let's go flip my camera around here.
[2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:27.800]  Go ahead. You're a reporter. Tell us everything.
[2:14:27.800 --> 2:14:32.800]  Okay, so we're walking along here and these are all congregants and supporters.
[2:14:32.800 --> 2:14:37.800]  They are allowed on the adjacent property because the landowner is friendly with the church.
[2:14:37.800 --> 2:14:44.800]  However, they did the landowner himself did kick the media off the mainstream media.
[2:14:44.800 --> 2:14:48.800]  I'm actually the only reporter that's allowed on church property here.
[2:14:48.800 --> 2:14:52.800]  And I've been coming here for approximately eight weeks.
[2:14:52.800 --> 2:14:58.800]  As you can see here, there's some folks praying dark times for this congregation.
[2:14:58.800 --> 2:15:08.800]  We're going to walk over just this is where the police have this gate here and they have private security here.
[2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:17.800]  And they brought in portable toilets because they plan to occupy this church for, I guess, however long it takes.
[2:15:17.800 --> 2:15:21.800]  It sounds like they're going to have surveillance here 24 hours, people monitoring it.
[2:15:21.800 --> 2:15:27.800]  And if I just step onto the grass here, you're going to see cops are going to be there.
[2:15:27.800 --> 2:15:28.800]  I'm sorry.
[2:15:28.800 --> 2:15:31.800]  You just please stay on this side. Thank you.
[2:15:31.800 --> 2:15:34.800]  What's the problem is just standing on the grass and not going near the church.
[2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:38.800]  I know, but it's that's the line. We need to keep on the line.
[2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:42.800]  No, the law is he's violated religious freedom. He's a tyrant of the CCP.
[2:15:42.800 --> 2:15:43.800]  Yep.
[2:15:43.800 --> 2:15:46.800]  Can you get through here as good as everything?
[2:15:46.800 --> 2:15:48.800]  Well,
[2:15:48.800 --> 2:15:53.800]  No, I mean, you don't want me reporting on what you're doing here. Clearly.
[2:15:53.800 --> 2:15:54.800]  No, absolutely.
[2:15:54.800 --> 2:15:56.800]  Is this a good angle?
[2:15:56.800 --> 2:15:57.800]  It's a great angle.
[2:15:57.800 --> 2:15:58.800]  Yeah.
[2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:00.800]  Who's this?
[2:16:00.800 --> 2:16:06.800]  Are you with Alberta Health Services or the RCMP with the RCMP? Okay, great.
[2:16:06.800 --> 2:16:07.800]  Thank you.
[2:16:07.800 --> 2:16:17.800]  We had an incident actually earlier today where the police were trespassing this fence here that they erected actually ended up on the other land owner.
[2:16:17.800 --> 2:16:22.800]  As you can see here, there's a and what is their excuse to kind of seize the church?
[2:16:22.800 --> 2:16:25.800]  Or what is this filthy occupation?
[2:16:25.800 --> 2:16:41.800]  Well, they're trying to prevent services from being held because Pastor James Cote, even though he was taken into custody for 35 days, the associate pastor at the church here stepped up and he started holding services knowing
[2:16:41.800 --> 2:16:48.800]  So they want to teach you a lesson because others might rebel against the permanent martial law lockdown house arrest.
[2:16:48.800 --> 2:16:49.800]  Right.
[2:16:49.800 --> 2:16:50.800]  That's exactly.
[2:16:50.800 --> 2:16:51.800]  So these are literal Nazis.
[2:16:51.800 --> 2:16:53.800]  We're looking at my God.
[2:16:53.800 --> 2:16:55.800]  Well, they couldn't control the church.
[2:16:55.800 --> 2:16:56.800]  They arrested their pastor.
[2:16:56.800 --> 2:17:01.800]  Another one stepped up unafraid, willing to go to jail alongside the first pastor.
[2:17:01.800 --> 2:17:03.800]  So they don't know what to do with these people.
[2:17:03.800 --> 2:17:06.800]  They have a gross misunderstanding of what Christianity is.
[2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:11.800]  We are called to be obedient to God above the government.
[2:17:11.800 --> 2:17:14.800]  We also are warned that persecution is coming.
[2:17:14.800 --> 2:17:16.800]  We're promised that it's coming.
[2:17:16.800 --> 2:17:22.800]  So the state grossly misunderstands the Christian philosophy.
[2:17:22.800 --> 2:17:23.800]  You can lock up their churches.
[2:17:23.800 --> 2:17:30.800]  You can chase them into caves, but they are going to gather together because they say that is how they practice their faith.
[2:17:30.800 --> 2:17:31.800]  Not online.
[2:17:31.800 --> 2:17:36.800]  Let me guess, is this making the church stronger or weaker?
[2:17:36.800 --> 2:17:40.800]  Alex, I've been coming here every Sunday for, I think, approximately eight weeks.
[2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:44.800]  I'm just going to step away because I know it's going to be loud for you.
[2:17:44.800 --> 2:17:48.800]  I've been coming here every week just about for eight weeks.
[2:17:48.800 --> 2:17:52.800]  And actually, some weeks I come at 5 a.m.
[2:17:52.800 --> 2:17:59.800]  because I thought they would do this to this church sooner, but they didn't.
[2:17:59.800 --> 2:18:02.800]  And the church has grown and grown and grown.
[2:18:02.800 --> 2:18:14.800]  Instead of being limited to 15% of fire code capacity, this church reaches 619 people every single week, which is 100% of fire code capacity.
[2:18:14.800 --> 2:18:20.800]  And people also listen to the services from their cars in the parking lot.
[2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:23.800]  They watch online from the parking lot.
[2:18:23.800 --> 2:18:37.800]  This has really lit a fire in the belly of a lot of Christians and people who are from other denominations are coming to this church inspired by Pastor James Coates and his resistance to these bad laws.
[2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:42.800]  But also, they come here because they're disappointed in their own churches for not being willing to do it.
[2:18:42.800 --> 2:18:43.800]  Well, that's right.
[2:18:43.800 --> 2:18:45.800]  The Marxist took over education in the West.
[2:18:45.800 --> 2:18:47.800]  In Canada, is this a joke now?
[2:18:47.800 --> 2:18:53.800]  And the police seem to be sued individually, all of them need to be, everyone should go to their houses and protest.
[2:18:53.800 --> 2:18:55.800]  They're the ones at your house assaulting you.
[2:18:55.800 --> 2:18:57.800]  These are just graceful monsters.
[2:18:57.800 --> 2:18:58.800]  And they think they're going to win.
[2:18:58.800 --> 2:18:59.800]  They have only seven in the world win.
[2:18:59.800 --> 2:19:00.800]  This is just outrageous.
[2:19:00.800 --> 2:19:04.800]  It's happening here in the United States from Michigan to California as well.
[2:19:04.800 --> 2:19:07.800]  I want to get you on for a full hour with us soon.
[2:19:07.800 --> 2:19:08.800]  This is so historic.
[2:19:08.800 --> 2:19:13.800]  We got Max Kaiser coming up with some big financial news, but I would love to get you back on me tomorrow.
[2:19:13.800 --> 2:19:15.800]  This is so historic.
[2:19:15.800 --> 2:19:25.800]  Are you able, the few minutes we have left to get on the roads, they don't arrest you or on the property line and march up and show people that black tarp they put up in front of the church like it's pornography or something?
[2:19:25.800 --> 2:19:26.800]  I definitely can.
[2:19:26.800 --> 2:19:30.800]  I know exactly where the property line is and the kind property owner.
[2:19:30.800 --> 2:19:38.800]  That's this man in the green jacket here has advised me that I'm very welcome to walk down the property line towards the church.
[2:19:38.800 --> 2:19:41.800]  And the police are probably going to hassle me, but I don't care.
[2:19:41.800 --> 2:19:49.800]  And I'd be happy to come on the show tomorrow and discuss this even further.
[2:19:49.800 --> 2:19:55.800]  It was my first real encounter with actual Satanism that wasn't closeted or clandestine.
[2:19:55.800 --> 2:20:05.800]  As I was on air with my boss Ezra Levant earlier today, a car drove past the church, yelled at the groups of small women and children.
[2:20:05.800 --> 2:20:10.800]  I don't know, they're unloading some supplies here in this police vehicle.
[2:20:10.800 --> 2:20:17.800]  And yelled at them and then used the church of Satan as his moral compass.
[2:20:17.800 --> 2:20:26.800]  He said to me that at least the church of Satan follows mask mandate.
[2:20:26.800 --> 2:20:29.800]  Of course Satan follows the law of this world.
[2:20:29.800 --> 2:20:31.800]  He's the king of this world.
[2:20:31.800 --> 2:20:40.800]  Of course, but it was just shocking to me to see it because usually that sort of stuff is a little more closeted and clandestin.
[2:20:40.800 --> 2:20:43.800]  A few more minutes with us Max Kaiser will be happy to hold this is so historic.
[2:20:43.800 --> 2:20:44.800]  Stay right there.
[2:20:44.800 --> 2:20:49.800]  I love how they put a sign up at the front and a gate to act like you couldn't go along the property beside it.
[2:20:49.800 --> 2:20:51.800]  The whole thing they're doing is incredibly illegal.
[2:20:51.800 --> 2:20:53.800]  How do people Sheila Gunn read?
[2:20:53.800 --> 2:20:56.800]  They go to rebelnews.com to find reports, but also Sheila Gunn read.
[2:20:56.800 --> 2:20:59.800]  I mean, this is this is what we talk about in communist China.
[2:20:59.800 --> 2:21:00.800]  This is happening right here in Canada.
[2:21:00.800 --> 2:21:10.800]  Alex, it's it's shocking to me to see because we have a purported conservative government here in Alberta.
[2:21:10.800 --> 2:21:19.800]  In fact, our Premier Jason Kenny, when he was in former conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government, religious freedom was central.
[2:21:19.800 --> 2:21:25.800]  But how much money is 50 cops and dozens of private security and a giant fence?
[2:21:25.800 --> 2:21:27.800]  How much money to shut one church?
[2:21:27.800 --> 2:21:28.800]  My God.
[2:21:28.800 --> 2:21:38.800]  I think because if the crackdown comes on this church, they'll scare a lot of other churches and stop them from standing up.
[2:21:38.800 --> 2:21:39.800]  Sure, they can't shut them all down.
[2:21:39.800 --> 2:21:40.800]  So I want to make an example.
[2:21:40.800 --> 2:21:43.800]  The answer is all churches, 100% capacity.
[2:21:43.800 --> 2:21:45.800]  These people are dirt bags and enemies of humanity.
[2:21:45.800 --> 2:21:47.800]  Stay there a few more minutes with you, ma'am.
[2:21:47.800 --> 2:21:52.800]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off.
[2:21:52.800 --> 2:21:58.800]  The success is in full versus that if you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[2:21:58.800 --> 2:22:08.800]  But I'll tell you this, the technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[2:22:08.800 --> 2:22:11.800]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance.
[2:22:11.800 --> 2:22:16.800]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[2:22:16.800 --> 2:22:19.800]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is about to be true.
[2:22:19.800 --> 2:22:22.800]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[2:22:22.800 --> 2:22:26.800]  The power structures of the silence, those of us that they can't.
[2:22:26.800 --> 2:22:31.800]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:22:31.800 --> 2:22:33.800]  We have the power.
[2:22:33.800 --> 2:22:37.800]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:22:37.800 --> 2:22:43.800]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't come.
[2:22:43.800 --> 2:22:45.800]  So be the polar bears you are.
[2:22:45.800 --> 2:22:54.800]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government.
[2:22:54.800 --> 2:22:57.800]  But world government is only the control grid.
[2:22:57.800 --> 2:23:05.800]  Now, inner members of the cult are told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality.
[2:23:05.800 --> 2:23:12.800]  But the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon based line forms.
[2:23:12.800 --> 2:23:14.800]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[2:23:14.800 --> 2:23:18.800]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[2:23:18.800 --> 2:23:20.800]  They are playing God.
[2:23:20.800 --> 2:23:29.800]  They believe they have been inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology to carry out this transformation.
[2:23:29.800 --> 2:23:31.800]  I know this sounds insane.
[2:23:31.800 --> 2:23:35.800]  But if you read the writings of the globalist, it's all on record.
[2:23:35.800 --> 2:23:37.800]  You have been warned.
[2:23:37.800 --> 2:23:42.800]  You have been given the information to say no to this plan.
[2:23:42.800 --> 2:23:45.800]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[2:23:45.800 --> 2:23:48.800]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[2:23:48.800 --> 2:23:51.800]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[2:23:51.800 --> 2:23:54.800]  They are creating insecurity, crime, war and famine.
[2:23:54.800 --> 2:24:02.800]  All of us should do everything we can to get prepared and get ready for ourselves and our family's sakes, but also our community.
[2:24:02.800 --> 2:24:09.800]  And citizensstronghold.com is the best place to go to get high quality body armor at the lowest price you are going to find.

[2:26:03.800 --> 2:26:11.800]  Well Sheila Gunn Reed is a reporter for Rebel News and she is there in Canada in Alberta
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:15.800]  where a huge popular church has had their pastor jailed for weeks.
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:20.800]  And now they've come with 50 plus police and dozens of vehicles and private security
[2:26:20.800 --> 2:26:22.800]  and put a huge fence up around.
[2:26:22.800 --> 2:26:25.800]  But I noticed when I was watching her live feed for radio listeners,
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:28.800]  you need to go to Bandai Video or local TV stations to see it.
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:31.800]  I went, why is there a gate only at the front of the road?
[2:26:31.800 --> 2:26:33.800]  I said, I bet there's property owned all around that where you can show it.
[2:26:33.800 --> 2:26:35.800]  She goes, yeah, here's the property owner.
[2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:36.800]  I'm going to walk up to it.
[2:26:36.800 --> 2:26:40.800]  But it shows how the cops all got out front to divert everyone out there
[2:26:40.800 --> 2:26:42.800]  and the hundreds of people that come aren't even near the church
[2:26:42.800 --> 2:26:46.800]  to show the big black veil they put up around it like it's dirty and bad
[2:26:46.800 --> 2:26:48.800]  because the Satanists don't want to see that.
[2:26:48.800 --> 2:26:49.800]  We have pro-life events.
[2:26:49.800 --> 2:26:52.800]  The Satanists went with this black tar paper and they all put it up in front of us
[2:26:52.800 --> 2:26:53.800]  in front of the media.
[2:26:53.800 --> 2:26:54.800]  They want to obscure us.
[2:26:54.800 --> 2:26:55.800]  They want to oppress us.
[2:26:55.800 --> 2:26:57.800]  They want to shut down our speeds.
[2:26:57.800 --> 2:26:58.800]  They want to censor us.
[2:26:58.800 --> 2:27:01.800]  And so we're definitely seeing millions of dollars spent here.
[2:27:01.800 --> 2:27:05.800]  I know how bureaucrats operate to do this, to shut this church down,
[2:27:05.800 --> 2:27:06.800]  to send a message to others.
[2:27:06.800 --> 2:27:09.800]  When we say stay closed, you stay closed.
[2:27:09.800 --> 2:27:10.800]  You're going to be closed forever anyway.
[2:27:10.800 --> 2:27:11.800]  You're not essential.
[2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:12.800]  The state wants to be God.
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:14.800]  There will be people alone.
[2:27:14.800 --> 2:27:15.800]  So this is incredible.
[2:27:15.800 --> 2:27:17.800]  So Sheila Gunnery, finish up any other points.
[2:27:17.800 --> 2:27:18.800]  We love you.
[2:27:18.800 --> 2:27:19.800]  We appreciate you.
[2:27:19.800 --> 2:27:20.800]  Where is this going?
[2:27:20.800 --> 2:27:22.800]  How long is the pastor going to jail?
[2:27:22.800 --> 2:27:23.800]  What's coming next?
[2:27:23.800 --> 2:27:25.800]  And what do you predict?
[2:27:25.800 --> 2:27:31.800]  So Pastor Coates was released about 10 days ago from his 35 days of incarceration.
[2:27:31.800 --> 2:27:37.800]  His first time back to the church, the RCMP came and tried to enter into his church.
[2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:40.800]  However, the church elders here didn't let him in.
[2:27:40.800 --> 2:27:45.800]  I spoke to the lawyer for the church this morning when I was on site.
[2:27:45.800 --> 2:27:51.800]  He informs me that he had no knowledge of anything that was going to transpire here.
[2:27:51.800 --> 2:27:53.800]  The last story I heard is he was still in jail.
[2:27:53.800 --> 2:27:54.800]  He's out of jail?
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:27:55.800]  Yes.
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:27:57.800]  He was released 10 days ago.
[2:27:57.800 --> 2:28:01.800]  And why aren't they letting him back in the church?
[2:28:01.800 --> 2:28:03.800]  He's been allowed back in the church.
[2:28:03.800 --> 2:28:06.800]  I did an interview with him after his release.
[2:28:06.800 --> 2:28:07.800]  Yeah.
[2:28:07.800 --> 2:28:12.800]  But because he's back, it's clear the authorities are worried that this church will just continue
[2:28:12.800 --> 2:28:17.800]  on and continue to grow and continue to defy the lockdown restrictions, which they are.
[2:28:17.800 --> 2:28:19.800]  So this is now their next resort.
[2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:23.800]  This is the next escalation of what's happening here at Grace Life Church.
[2:28:23.800 --> 2:28:30.800]  But Alex, I got to tell you, I have been to Northern Iraq as part of my work with Rebel News,
[2:28:30.800 --> 2:28:32.800]  as part of our Save the Christians initiative.
[2:28:32.800 --> 2:28:37.800]  I've seen where Christian persecution goes in the end.
[2:28:37.800 --> 2:28:40.800]  I've seen the bombed out churches of Batnaya.
[2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:44.800]  I've seen the churches with ISIS graffiti.
[2:28:44.800 --> 2:28:50.800]  And to see that level of Christian persecution, when I came home, I was left with a great
[2:28:50.800 --> 2:28:56.800]  sense of shame that our churches didn't stand up then to help those Christians, our Christian
[2:28:56.800 --> 2:28:58.800]  brothers and sisters, halfway around the world.
[2:28:58.800 --> 2:29:05.800]  But I'm even more ashamed today that there are so few churches here in my home province
[2:29:05.800 --> 2:29:10.800]  of Alberta, in all of Canada, and frankly, in the United States, that are willing to
[2:29:10.800 --> 2:29:16.800]  take the same stand that Pastor James Coates and Grace Life Church has taken.
[2:29:16.800 --> 2:29:20.800]  They are really, you know, willing to face the consequences.
[2:29:20.800 --> 2:29:21.800]  No, I agree.
[2:29:21.800 --> 2:29:25.800]  I think you guys, now that it's warming up, you should have giant Wednesday night, Sunday
[2:29:25.800 --> 2:29:30.800]  night, huge rallies right out there in that private landowner's area, outside, put up
[2:29:30.800 --> 2:29:33.800]  tents, and just double down on these scumbags.
[2:29:33.800 --> 2:29:35.800]  I mean, I am so ashamed of those police.
[2:29:35.800 --> 2:29:39.800]  I am so ashamed of your bureaucrats, and you need to change your government.
[2:29:39.800 --> 2:29:44.800]  In closing, because our guest Max Keiser is here, Shelley Gunn Reid of Rebel News.
[2:29:44.800 --> 2:29:49.800]  Why do you think your so-called conservative government is going along with this?
[2:29:49.800 --> 2:29:51.800]  You know, it's like any government, really.
[2:29:51.800 --> 2:29:55.800]  They are beholden to the health of deep states.
[2:29:55.800 --> 2:29:58.800]  In the United States, Trump knew there was a deep state.
[2:29:58.800 --> 2:30:02.800]  In Canada here, we do have a health bureaucracy deep state.
[2:30:02.800 --> 2:30:06.800]  We have a bunch of chief medical officers of health, highly paid bureaucrats.
[2:30:06.800 --> 2:30:10.800]  Nobody knew their name a year ago, and now they have all this power.
[2:30:10.800 --> 2:30:14.800]  They're unelected, unaccountable, and yet they control every aspect of your life.
[2:30:14.800 --> 2:30:19.800]  And boy, they sure like it, and they're not going to turn that power back over to people
[2:30:19.800 --> 2:30:22.800]  very soon or very easily.
[2:30:22.800 --> 2:30:24.800]  Alright, Sheila, incredible to see this.
[2:30:24.800 --> 2:30:27.800]  Just right out of the subway, right out of the comm, is China.
[2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:32.800]  Massive church shutdowns all over the world while the baseball games and football games are open.
[2:30:32.800 --> 2:30:34.800]  Thank you so much, Sheila, Gunn Reid.
[2:30:34.800 --> 2:30:36.800]  Alright, there she goes.
[2:30:36.800 --> 2:30:38.800]  I want to get her and the pastor now that he's out of jail,
[2:30:38.800 --> 2:30:42.800]  because the news is saying he's still in jail on the show as soon as possible.
[2:30:42.800 --> 2:30:44.800]  Thank you, Sheila at rebelnews.com.
[2:30:44.800 --> 2:30:48.800]  Alright, joining us for the next 25 minutes or so is Max Keiser,
[2:30:48.800 --> 2:30:52.800]  a host of Al Jazeera shows, BBC shows, RT shows,
[2:30:52.800 --> 2:30:57.800]  big famous stockbroker from the 80s, and the big grandpa of Bitcoin.
[2:30:57.800 --> 2:31:00.800]  The first guy I heard about Bitcoin from like 12 years ago, 10 years ago,
[2:31:00.800 --> 2:31:02.800]  he tried to give me 10,000 Bitcoin.
[2:31:02.800 --> 2:31:06.800]  And Max Keiser, the Orange Pill podcast, joins us.
[2:31:06.800 --> 2:31:09.800]  We'll talk about Bitcoin next segment and what's happening in the world market
[2:31:09.800 --> 2:31:12.800]  when he's been predicting it goes up to 200,000 or the rest of it.
[2:31:12.800 --> 2:31:14.800]  But first, what is this move worldwide?
[2:31:14.800 --> 2:31:19.800]  You predicted the casino gulag where a small bar, a small gym, a small business,
[2:31:19.800 --> 2:31:27.800]  a church is closed, but everything else is open and the airplanes are open and all this.
[2:31:27.800 --> 2:31:30.800]  I mean, it's so obvious that big techs in a vertical integration
[2:31:30.800 --> 2:31:32.800]  and that big corporations are consolidating power,
[2:31:32.800 --> 2:31:34.800]  why are they doing this and how would you counter it?
[2:31:34.800 --> 2:31:38.800]  Because it's so crazy to see churches closed all over the U.S., all over Canada,
[2:31:38.800 --> 2:31:43.800]  all over Europe, but then right next to them, giant strip malls are open.
[2:31:43.800 --> 2:31:46.800]  What the hell is going on?
[2:31:46.800 --> 2:31:50.800]  Right. Well, I mean, if you have powerful people, we'll always seek more power.
[2:31:50.800 --> 2:31:57.800]  And as always, you can trace back the source of their power to figure out money printing, right?
[2:31:57.800 --> 2:32:01.800]  The central bank money printing and 0% interest rates.
[2:32:01.800 --> 2:32:07.800]  And so when you give that availability of essentially free money to the people
[2:32:07.800 --> 2:32:12.800]  who already have a huge amount of money, they will use that money to get rid of the competition
[2:32:12.800 --> 2:32:20.800]  and to consolidate their power base and to consolidate their control of the economy.
[2:32:20.800 --> 2:32:27.800]  And so during this lockdown, it was a tremendous stressful period.
[2:32:27.800 --> 2:32:32.800]  So those with the access to the free money used it opportunistically
[2:32:32.800 --> 2:32:37.800]  to expand their influence in the economy, their control of the economy.
[2:32:37.800 --> 2:32:42.800]  Remember, Alex, I've often said that you can't really use traditional economic terms
[2:32:42.800 --> 2:32:45.800]  to describe what's going on here, like inflation or deflation.
[2:32:45.800 --> 2:32:49.800]  You have to really use the term neo feudalism, right?
[2:32:49.800 --> 2:32:55.800]  We're going into more of a feudalistic economic model where you've got a very, very few people
[2:32:55.800 --> 2:33:02.800]  in the country control 99.5% of the entire economic activity.
[2:33:02.800 --> 2:33:10.800]  So, and this is a great easy for them because they have unlimited free money to do so.
[2:33:10.800 --> 2:33:17.800]  In the Middle Ages, they had to go to war and actually put people in harm's way to build up their empires.
[2:33:17.800 --> 2:33:22.800]  But in this feudal period, all they do is access over at the discount window at the Federal Reserve,
[2:33:22.800 --> 2:33:26.800]  trillions of dollars of free money to impact the...
[2:33:26.800 --> 2:33:27.800]  Exactly.
[2:33:27.800 --> 2:33:32.800]  And so by saying their competition is not essential, it actually now gives all their fiat more value
[2:33:32.800 --> 2:33:34.800]  because we need them.
[2:33:34.800 --> 2:33:37.800]  This is such a cold-blooded predatory takeover, my God.
[2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:39.800]  And the Republicans are all going along with it.
[2:33:39.800 --> 2:33:42.800]  People say, oh, they're ignorant, no, they're paid off by the same people max.
[2:33:42.800 --> 2:33:45.800]  So how do we counter it with things like Bitcoin?
[2:33:45.800 --> 2:33:50.800]  We diversify, we pull down the old system, we don't play along with them.
[2:33:50.800 --> 2:33:51.800]  Right.
[2:33:51.800 --> 2:33:58.800]  In the case of Bitcoin, you're taking wealth and you're putting it out of the reach of the state or anybody else.
[2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:02.800]  And this is the first time in history this has ever been possible.
[2:34:02.800 --> 2:34:08.800]  Usually, even with gold or silver, the problem is that it's very difficult to move around.
[2:34:08.800 --> 2:34:15.800]  It's not portable and also the price is subject to a lot of suppression schemes that we've talked about before.
[2:34:15.800 --> 2:34:22.800]  But Bitcoin, however, unlike gold, is completely portable. All you need is to memorize your seed phrase for your wallet
[2:34:22.800 --> 2:34:24.800]  and you can travel anywhere in the world.
[2:34:24.800 --> 2:34:32.800]  You could go to the airport, stock, make it, fly anywhere you want the world, land, go to the internet and there's your money.
[2:34:32.800 --> 2:34:37.800]  You just enter the seed phrase and it could be any amount of money that you have is right there.
[2:34:37.800 --> 2:34:43.800]  And if you're in a country that wants to have you as their citizen with all of your money
[2:34:43.800 --> 2:34:50.800]  and they're going to give you a nice life in exchange and they'll do their job as a government by cleaning the garbage out
[2:34:50.800 --> 2:34:54.800]  and building the roads and doing the things the government should be doing, it's a good relationship.
[2:34:54.800 --> 2:35:04.800]  But if the United States is no longer going to be friendly to me and my capital, then I will very simply, I will just leave.
[2:35:04.800 --> 2:35:10.800]  That's why they want global government and not quote tax havens because global government is about you have no place to run
[2:35:10.800 --> 2:35:16.800]  and it's a corporate world government. I want to talk about that with Max Kaiser and the future of Bitcoin.
[2:35:16.800 --> 2:35:19.800]  The question is China's digital currency has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
[2:35:19.800 --> 2:35:22.800]  That's what zero hedge is saying. Is that accurate?
[2:35:22.800 --> 2:35:25.800]  We'll ask Max Kaiser on the other side of this quick break.
[2:35:25.800 --> 2:35:28.800]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the InfoWar.
[2:35:28.800 --> 2:35:30.800]  InfoWars.com.
[2:35:30.800 --> 2:35:32.800]  InfoWars.com.
[2:35:32.800 --> 2:35:39.800]  Tomorrow's news today and to share that link is a revolutionary act.
[2:35:39.800 --> 2:35:41.800]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[2:36:09.800 --> 2:36:16.800]  We're going to talk about the essential vitamins and minerals and the key amino acids known to help carry this nutrition into the cells.
[2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:23.800]  So for your immune system, for your whole body, for life itself, vitamin mineral fusion back in stock at InfoWars.com.
[2:36:23.800 --> 2:36:27.800]  And despite the fact we can't keep it on the shelves, it's 40% off.
[2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:30.800]  The supply chains are breaking down. We try to put it in a bigger order.
[2:36:30.800 --> 2:36:35.800]  We couldn't even get it because getting high quality ingredients is very, very hard and we're not going to cut corners.
[2:36:35.800 --> 2:36:37.800]  We're going to keep the quality at the highest levels.
[2:36:37.800 --> 2:36:48.800]  It also funds the InfoWars, so get your vitamin mineral fusion now at InfoWarsStore.com or triple A 2533139.
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:54.800]  Throughout history there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[2:36:54.800 --> 2:36:57.800]  One is born of Renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[2:36:57.800 --> 2:37:06.800]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[2:37:06.800 --> 2:37:12.800]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[2:37:12.800 --> 2:37:20.800]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:24.800]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[2:37:24.800 --> 2:37:29.800]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[2:37:29.800 --> 2:37:36.800]  A global permanent lockdown is here that is already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[2:37:36.800 --> 2:37:44.800]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the coming lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[2:37:44.800 --> 2:37:47.800]  That's the facts. This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:52.800]  Humanity has been domesticated by and large.
[2:37:52.800 --> 2:37:57.800]  The population has been trained to submit, do what you're told, and it's all going to pass.
[2:37:57.800 --> 2:38:06.800]  But if you study authoritarians, if you study the globalists, you understand that they reach a point where all the training is just beta and you go into the point of being cold, being totally enslaved.
[2:38:06.800 --> 2:38:11.800]  And because the globalists see us as weak and see us as stupid, they are now making that move.
[2:38:11.800 --> 2:38:22.800]  And they are collapsing the third world with their economic weapons to then flood us with the third world that the UN will use as a weapon to then have us under such a crisis, under such a load,
[2:38:22.800 --> 2:38:29.800]  capitulate to the UN, whatever agreements they want us to sign, hoping that they will stop the flood of tens of millions of refugees,
[2:38:29.800 --> 2:38:35.800]  not fleeing COVID or climate change, as the UN and Klaus Schwabber is saying and Bill Gates is saying,
[2:38:35.800 --> 2:38:45.800]  but fleeing the year-long lockdowns that the UN and Bill Gates ordered them to institute or they wouldn't get more IMF and World Bank money.
[2:38:45.800 --> 2:38:49.800]  And that's why we have to really get educated about the globalists.
[2:38:49.800 --> 2:38:57.800]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain registers that promote free speech and freedom of association.
[2:38:57.800 --> 2:39:05.800]  And they know that Big Tech is buying up almost all the other major companies and engaging in massive censorship and organized crime racketeering.
[2:39:05.800 --> 2:39:08.800]  That's why they've been massively expanding their services.
[2:39:08.800 --> 2:39:16.800]  So whether you have domains or want to register a domain or want help building a website or want servers or any other major service, they've got it all and they're expanding.
[2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:29.800]  And if you go to infowarsdomains.com and follow that link, you get all their services at the lowest price and 25% of your sign up for a new domain or a domain you move goes to fund the info war.
[2:39:29.800 --> 2:39:34.800]  And then we get 5% as well for any servers or any other type of services that you get from them.
[2:39:34.800 --> 2:39:41.800]  So it's a win-win as we build a true open free internet again because the globalists are destroying what was open and what was free.
[2:39:41.800 --> 2:39:49.800]  So infowarsdomains.com, the revolution starts there. Infowarsdomains.com, take action now.
[2:40:11.800 --> 2:40:13.800]  Let them know you have God.
[2:40:13.800 --> 2:40:21.800]  There you'll find salvation along with oblivion.
[2:40:21.800 --> 2:40:26.800]  Max Kaiser, the King Daddy of Bitcoin is here with us.
[2:40:26.800 --> 2:40:31.800]  I love getting him on and I've looked at this and we need to have these crypto revolutions.
[2:40:31.800 --> 2:40:33.800]  We need to have it. The globalists are scared of it.
[2:40:33.800 --> 2:40:35.800]  It's definitely beginning to beat them.
[2:40:35.800 --> 2:40:41.800]  We need to see it as an exit strategy they have planned now as they begin to capitulate into it.
[2:40:41.800 --> 2:40:43.800]  And I've looked at it. It looks like a capitulation.
[2:40:43.800 --> 2:40:48.800]  But getting back to where you were about they have all the free capital.
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:56.800]  They have the stain for us. They own the media and they are just engaged in all out war with the general economy and stability.
[2:40:56.800 --> 2:40:59.800]  Where do they think their money is going to be any good?
[2:40:59.800 --> 2:41:04.800]  Or they think they can just turn us into the wall, wall, west and then turn it back to control overnight.
[2:41:04.800 --> 2:41:09.800]  I think we're going to go the way of Mexico on a big global scale of lawlessness and a breakdown of civilization.
[2:41:09.800 --> 2:41:15.800]  You can't pull a collapse like this in America and not get a giant violent civil war.
[2:41:15.800 --> 2:41:19.800]  Do they think they're going to sit that out Max or are they not thinking that far?
[2:41:19.800 --> 2:41:24.800]  No, I think what's called social unrest is going to increase.
[2:41:24.800 --> 2:41:32.800]  And that's why again you have to be agile and you have to be prepared to pack your bag and leave
[2:41:32.800 --> 2:41:35.800]  and go somewhere where you're not going to have these problems.
[2:41:35.800 --> 2:41:38.800]  And there's a big, big beautiful world out there.
[2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:41.800]  You know, I was shocked. I tell you, I was shocked.
[2:41:41.800 --> 2:41:43.800]  I've heard a lot of things, but I was even shocked.
[2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:54.800]  Janet Yellen, who's now running the Treasury said yesterday that she supports the idea of introducing a global minimum tax rate for corporations.
[2:41:54.800 --> 2:42:03.800]  So the US is now in the EU has come back and they agree with this idea that there's going to be a global minimum tax rate on all corporations globally.
[2:42:03.800 --> 2:42:09.800]  So that right there is the beginning of what you would call a globalist takeover.
[2:42:09.800 --> 2:42:13.800]  Well, that's the dream of the OECD and the UN. That's it right there.
[2:42:13.800 --> 2:42:25.800]  Yeah, so now they're on the trail to create a supernatural global tax collector and backed up by the military.
[2:42:25.800 --> 2:42:33.800]  And so they'll be coming knocking door to door and saying, give us some money or we're going to blow you away.
[2:42:33.800 --> 2:42:38.800]  I mean, that's pretty much America's foreign policy right now is accept dollars or we'll kill you.
[2:42:38.800 --> 2:42:43.800]  I was about to say, what do you make of the US sitting trips into Ukraine openly trying to start a war with Russia?
[2:42:43.800 --> 2:42:49.800]  And then they're like, oh, look, Russia's mobilizing heavy military. This is insane.
[2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:52.800]  Very interesting story happening in Ukraine, Alex.
[2:42:52.800 --> 2:42:57.800]  It comes out that Ukraine is one of the biggest countries in the world that owns Bitcoin.
[2:42:57.800 --> 2:43:02.800]  They've got tens of thousands of Bitcoin, billions and billions of dollars worth of Bitcoin.
[2:43:02.800 --> 2:43:13.800]  So this could be the first macro geopolitical event we see where a country that has a very big Bitcoin position is involved.
[2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:15.800]  I think that's fascinating.
[2:43:15.800 --> 2:43:17.800]  The start of the Bitcoin wars.
[2:43:17.800 --> 2:43:20.800]  Yes, exactly. What I call the hash wars or the hash race.
[2:43:20.800 --> 2:43:25.800]  Obviously at odds here would be Russia.
[2:43:25.800 --> 2:43:28.800]  To my knowledge, I don't believe Russia.
[2:43:28.800 --> 2:43:32.800]  They have not officially stated they have any Bitcoin position. I know they've been buying a lot of gold.
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:36.800]  But Ukraine has been officially accumulating Bitcoin.
[2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:39.800]  And we have some other countries doing the same thing.
[2:43:39.800 --> 2:43:46.800]  I think that America to stay relevant in the 21st century has got to come out with a pro Bitcoin policy and say,
[2:43:46.800 --> 2:43:53.800]  we're actively storing and mining Bitcoin as a strategic reserve in the interest of national security.
[2:43:53.800 --> 2:44:00.800]  Otherwise, a country like Ukraine or possibly Nigeria or Iran also has a huge Bitcoin position.
[2:44:00.800 --> 2:44:07.800]  Iran could be the richest country in the world in five years if nobody else steps up and starts mining and hoarding Bitcoin.
[2:44:07.800 --> 2:44:10.800]  So does the US want Iran to be the richest country in the world?
[2:44:10.800 --> 2:44:12.800]  That's the question people in Washington have got.
[2:44:12.800 --> 2:44:15.800]  I know that Biden's a total puppet, but that means something as well.
[2:44:15.800 --> 2:44:19.800]  Having no position, having to intellect is the same as having a position.
[2:44:19.800 --> 2:44:24.800]  Because his minions have a position. Iran won't even meet with him now. North Korea won't meet him.
[2:44:24.800 --> 2:44:29.800]  This guy is a joke. He's waving at crowds that don't exist at Easter Bunny Outfits at the White House.
[2:44:29.800 --> 2:44:33.800]  I mean, this is like a bad asset trip. Where do you see that going?
[2:44:33.800 --> 2:44:41.800]  Geopolitically, I'll tell you what the most interesting story in my view is that I think you've got a situation with
[2:44:41.800 --> 2:44:50.800]  brewing with Germany where they effectively leave NATO because of Nord Stream 2. Nord Stream 2 is, of course,
[2:44:50.800 --> 2:44:59.800]  goes from Russia to Germany. It's a pipeline and it goes around all kinds of problems in the Middle East.
[2:44:59.800 --> 2:45:03.800]  So the final dreaded German-Russian alliance could happen?
[2:45:03.800 --> 2:45:11.800]  Yeah, I think the U.S. has got a big troop presence in Germany, but I think that Germany, at the end of the day,
[2:45:11.800 --> 2:45:21.800]  will prefer getting natural gas from Russia at 80 to 90% cheaper than being shipped in from the U.S.
[2:45:21.800 --> 2:45:30.800]  And I think that'll be the swing vote. That'll be the beginning of a new global conflict where it's essentially
[2:45:30.800 --> 2:45:40.800]  Russia, Germany, China, Iran versus the U.S., the U.K., Japan on the other side.
[2:45:40.800 --> 2:45:46.800]  And Saudi Arabia probably won't, you know, they'll go with the other axis on the other side.
[2:45:46.800 --> 2:45:52.800]  So in that conflict, it doesn't seem like the U.S. is holding a very strong hand to tell you the truth.
[2:45:52.800 --> 2:45:57.800]  And so why are special interests trying to undermine the U.S. as fast as possible?
[2:45:57.800 --> 2:46:00.800]  The smart globe will say what the U.S. will be a dominant force.
[2:46:00.800 --> 2:46:06.800]  What's the larger geopolitical, or is that just that leftist billionaires and Hollywood billionaires have a heart on
[2:46:06.800 --> 2:46:10.800]  against America because their grandfather wasn't allowed into the country club?
[2:46:10.800 --> 2:46:13.800]  I mean, is that all this is?
[2:46:13.800 --> 2:46:21.800]  I think the scarce is fast set in the world, you know, and geopolitics and the wealth of nations, as Adam Smith would call it,
[2:46:21.800 --> 2:46:25.800]  is based on who controls the most of the scarce.
[2:46:25.800 --> 2:46:30.800]  And the scarce is fast set in the world, it's not oil, it's not gold, it's Bitcoin.
[2:46:30.800 --> 2:46:34.800]  And so countries are beginning to realize this, and the smart countries are making their move now.
[2:46:34.800 --> 2:46:39.800]  The U.S. is lagging, and this is where it could be U.S. is a killy seal.
[2:46:39.800 --> 2:46:45.800]  This could be how U.S. loses its place in the world order by not accumulating Bitcoin at the end of the world.
[2:46:45.800 --> 2:46:51.800]  And by the way, Max, it's not like you just showed up and started promoting Bitcoin this week.
[2:46:51.800 --> 2:46:56.800]  I've done it for 12 years, I've done it 10 years intensely, and so it's just been going straight up in the aggregate.
[2:46:56.800 --> 2:46:58.800]  And of course, I'm promoting it now.
[2:46:58.800 --> 2:47:02.800]  People want to get $10 of free Bitcoin and start investing in it.
[2:47:02.800 --> 2:47:08.800]  The cleanest, safest place to do it is swanbitcoin.com, forward slash Alex.
[2:47:08.800 --> 2:47:14.800]  And then that way we get a little bit of a quarter percent of 1% of a fee if you actually invest with Bitcoin there.
[2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:16.800]  And I've been doing that because I've waited too long.
[2:47:16.800 --> 2:47:20.800]  But I mean, regardless, and oh, you just started saying this, you've been saying it for over 10 years.
[2:47:20.800 --> 2:47:22.800]  Why are you so confident on Bitcoin?
[2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:24.800]  And why does it continue to go up?
[2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:29.800]  Well, it's proven itself to do exactly what it said it was going to do when it was created.
[2:47:29.800 --> 2:47:40.800]  When it was created, the first block, as it's called, there was an inscription that said Bank of England is on the verge of a second bailout for banks.
[2:47:40.800 --> 2:47:43.800]  So it's clearly a protest vote against central banks.
[2:47:43.800 --> 2:47:46.800]  Bitcoin was created as a protest against central banks.
[2:47:46.800 --> 2:47:49.800]  It was also created to be digital gold.
[2:47:49.800 --> 2:47:55.800]  And we know that from the creator of Bitcoin, he made numerous notes and numerous locations and chat boards about how this is basically digital gold.
[2:47:55.800 --> 2:47:57.800]  And we're going to take the gold market.
[2:47:57.800 --> 2:48:03.800]  So having seen that 10 years ago, 11 years ago, when I looked at that, I said, well, the gold market's worth $10 trillion.
[2:48:03.800 --> 2:48:08.800]  If Bitcoin were to get to $10 trillion, that would be $500,000 per coin.
[2:48:08.800 --> 2:48:11.800]  At that time, it was $1 per coin.
[2:48:11.800 --> 2:48:21.800]  So I said, wow, even if it gets a small portion of that, it's going to be a hugely profitable investment to buy it at a dollar.
[2:48:21.800 --> 2:48:23.800]  And that's what we started doing.
[2:48:23.800 --> 2:48:28.800]  And now that's $55,000, $56,000 a coin.
[2:48:28.800 --> 2:48:32.800]  It looks like in 2021, it'll get to $220,000 per coin.
[2:48:32.800 --> 2:48:34.800]  And it will get to that $500,000.
[2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:37.800]  And it will be valued equally to gold.
[2:48:37.800 --> 2:48:40.800]  And then it'll be valued more than gold because it's scarcer than gold.
[2:48:40.800 --> 2:48:45.800]  Gold is relatively scarce, but Bitcoin is absolutely scarce.
[2:48:45.800 --> 2:48:47.800]  Let's talk about what's not scarce.
[2:48:47.800 --> 2:48:54.800]  Does anyone know the real inflation or the real number of yins, yons, rubles, dollars?
[2:48:54.800 --> 2:48:55.800]  I mean, what is it?
[2:48:55.800 --> 2:48:56.800]  Is it $1,000 trillion?
[2:48:56.800 --> 2:48:58.800]  I mean, what is it?
[2:48:58.800 --> 2:48:59.800]  Nobody knows.
[2:48:59.800 --> 2:49:00.800]  Exactly right.
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:01.800]  There's no accountability.
[2:49:01.800 --> 2:49:06.800]  The government has absolutely no idea how many dollars are in circulation.
[2:49:06.800 --> 2:49:11.800]  Remember during Iraq war, trillions of them were airdropped into Iraq on pallets.
[2:49:11.800 --> 2:49:13.800]  I'm not showing it to billions on pallets.
[2:49:13.800 --> 2:49:18.800]  Just airdropped all over Iraq to buy off the local moulas, et cetera.
[2:49:18.800 --> 2:49:20.800]  And that's never been accountable.
[2:49:20.800 --> 2:49:26.800]  Remember the day before 9-11, Donald Rimsfeld made a comment about a missing $1 trillion
[2:49:26.800 --> 2:49:28.800]  that nobody could find.
[2:49:28.800 --> 2:49:30.800]  The next day was 9-11.
[2:49:30.800 --> 2:49:33.800]  And that story got kind of forgotten.
[2:49:33.800 --> 2:49:36.800]  That he was admitting the fact that nobody knew.
[2:49:36.800 --> 2:49:39.800]  And later they admitted it's like last time the numbers like $2.7 trillion missing.
[2:49:39.800 --> 2:49:43.800]  Yeah, there's no accountability.
[2:49:43.800 --> 2:49:49.800]  They print now the official debt is $28 trillion.
[2:49:49.800 --> 2:49:55.800]  That's up from another $8 trillion in just a few months, actually.
[2:49:55.800 --> 2:50:00.800]  There's no, and with interest rates at 0%, there's absolutely nothing to stop them from
[2:50:00.800 --> 2:50:03.800]  printing another $50, $60, $100 trillion.
[2:50:03.800 --> 2:50:05.800]  There's absolutely nothing to stop it.
[2:50:05.800 --> 2:50:10.800]  They say there's no inflation, and yet housing prices are through the roof.
[2:50:10.800 --> 2:50:13.800]  Education is up 500% or 600% in the last decade.
[2:50:13.800 --> 2:50:16.800]  Healthcare costs are up 500% in the last decade.
[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:18.800]  People can't afford health.
[2:50:18.800 --> 2:50:20.800]  They can't afford education.
[2:50:20.800 --> 2:50:22.800]  And they say there's no inflation.
[2:50:22.800 --> 2:50:24.800]  So they're clearly lying.
[2:50:24.800 --> 2:50:27.800]  There's a lot of inflation because of a lot of money printing.
[2:50:27.800 --> 2:50:31.800]  If you have more questions, then Patrick Howley joins us on the latest Republican
[2:50:31.800 --> 2:50:33.800]  Establishments, Handles, and More.
[2:50:33.800 --> 2:50:38.800]  Hour number four, only two minutes away.
[2:50:38.800 --> 2:50:41.800]  The equation is very simple.
[2:50:41.800 --> 2:50:43.800]  The mega banks control the media.
[2:50:43.800 --> 2:50:45.800]  They control big pharma.
[2:50:45.800 --> 2:50:47.800]  They control academia.
[2:50:47.800 --> 2:50:50.800]  They control the military, industrial complex.
[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:52.800]  They control big tech.
[2:50:52.800 --> 2:50:56.800]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have status.
[2:50:56.800 --> 2:51:00.800]  Absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[2:51:00.800 --> 2:51:05.800]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that
[2:51:05.800 --> 2:51:09.800]  promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[2:51:09.800 --> 2:51:14.800]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opt it,
[2:51:14.800 --> 2:51:21.800]  turn it upside down, and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom
[2:51:21.800 --> 2:51:25.800]  and the free market that threatens their monopoly, so control.
[2:51:25.800 --> 2:51:30.800]  That's why they target info wars because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[2:51:30.800 --> 2:51:35.800]  The only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[2:51:35.800 --> 2:51:36.800]  So redouble your efforts.
[2:51:36.800 --> 2:51:39.800]  We're all in this together.
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:41.800]  Gerald and South Carolina, go ahead.
[2:51:41.800 --> 2:51:42.800]  You're on the air trying to move quicker.
[2:51:42.800 --> 2:51:43.800]  Hey, Alex.
[2:51:43.800 --> 2:51:44.800]  Welcome.
[2:51:44.800 --> 2:51:48.800]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[2:51:48.800 --> 2:51:51.800]  Wanted to warn people, I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year.
[2:51:51.800 --> 2:51:58.800]  Okay, I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that will never go away.
[2:51:58.800 --> 2:52:00.800]  Living defense saved my life.
[2:52:00.800 --> 2:52:04.800]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[2:52:04.800 --> 2:52:06.800]  Living defense brought me back.
[2:52:06.800 --> 2:52:08.800]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible.
[2:52:08.800 --> 2:52:11.800]  Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[2:52:11.800 --> 2:52:14.800]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9.
[2:52:14.800 --> 2:52:23.800]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[2:52:23.800 --> 2:52:28.800]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[2:52:28.800 --> 2:52:30.800]  That's right where we're at brother.
[2:52:30.800 --> 2:52:34.800]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say.
[2:52:34.800 --> 2:52:41.800]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[2:52:41.800 --> 2:52:48.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:52:48.800 --> 2:52:59.800]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[2:52:59.800 --> 2:53:07.800]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[2:53:07.800 --> 2:53:11.800]  This is a new article on infowars.com.
[2:53:11.800 --> 2:53:24.800]  This is sick. That's coming up next segment.
[2:53:24.800 --> 2:53:28.800]  And I got sent video, you know, I got some friends up at Fort Bragg.
[2:53:28.800 --> 2:53:33.800]  And it was in the news that they're saying to use the commentary to get food to work out.
[2:53:33.800 --> 2:53:35.800]  You got to have the shot even though it's not mandatory.
[2:53:35.800 --> 2:53:37.800]  Well, I sent some people over there.
[2:53:37.800 --> 2:53:40.800]  I got the photos, the video, all of them put in a report.
[2:53:40.800 --> 2:53:43.800]  They say no shot period. You're not coming in here.
[2:53:43.800 --> 2:53:46.800]  Even though most people are allergic to it or there's waivers, they don't care.
[2:53:46.800 --> 2:53:49.800]  This is a vaccine passport control.
[2:53:49.800 --> 2:53:54.800]  Max Kaiser, the king of Bitcoin joins us for another five minutes.
[2:53:54.800 --> 2:53:57.800]  What else would you like to impart about Bitcoin?
[2:53:57.800 --> 2:54:01.800]  I mean, obviously, if listeners want to support us in a sponsorship way,
[2:54:01.800 --> 2:54:05.800]  it's sponsored by swanbitcoin.com, Ford slash Alex.
[2:54:05.800 --> 2:54:07.800]  You've been trying to get me to sign up for this group for many years.
[2:54:07.800 --> 2:54:09.800]  It's one of the original OGs.
[2:54:09.800 --> 2:54:11.800]  The safest place to invest in Bitcoin.
[2:54:11.800 --> 2:54:15.800]  If you want to support us in our sponsorship, swanbitcoin.com, Ford slash Alex,
[2:54:15.800 --> 2:54:18.800]  get ten free dollars of Bitcoin there and then buy Bitcoin there.
[2:54:18.800 --> 2:54:22.800]  It's the best place if you want to privately hold that in your view.
[2:54:22.800 --> 2:54:25.800]  And I trust you to do it, swanbitcoin.com, Ford slash Alex.
[2:54:25.800 --> 2:54:30.800]  And my wife just bought some Bitcoin at swanbitcoin.com, Ford slash Alex.
[2:54:30.800 --> 2:54:32.800]  Continuing here in the last four minutes, we have left.
[2:54:32.800 --> 2:54:35.800]  What else would you like to impart, Max Kaiser?
[2:54:35.800 --> 2:54:41.800]  I think it's important to understand that Bitcoin comes from what are called the cypher punks.
[2:54:41.800 --> 2:54:46.800]  If Alex Jones were a computer programmer, he would be a cypher punk.
[2:54:46.800 --> 2:54:50.800]  The cypher punks are the rebels in the technology space.
[2:54:50.800 --> 2:54:56.800]  The cypher punks are what gave us stole encryption technology from the Pentagon and made it public.
[2:54:56.800 --> 2:54:59.800]  We would not have access to pretty good encryption technology.
[2:54:59.800 --> 2:55:02.800]  Edward Snowden is like a modern day cypher punk.
[2:55:02.800 --> 2:55:06.800]  Yeah, Edward Snowden is a cypher punk. Julian Assange is a cypher punk.
[2:55:06.800 --> 2:55:12.800]  And the people who gave us access to, you and I able to use encrypted messages.
[2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:16.800]  They're the folks that gave us Donald Trump. They just keep giving us all these goodies.
[2:55:16.800 --> 2:55:18.800]  I don't know about that one.
[2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:20.800]  Trump wasn't perfect, but controlled to Biden.
[2:55:20.800 --> 2:55:24.800]  I mean, it was Julian Assange got Trump over the gold post.
[2:55:24.800 --> 2:55:30.800]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's on the political side of things. You know, you go down that rabbit hole.
[2:55:30.800 --> 2:55:34.800]  But importantly, the cypher punks are what gave us Bitcoin.
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:39.800]  And they did it because they hate centralized authorities.
[2:55:39.800 --> 2:55:44.800]  They hate central banks and they hate dictatorial megalomaniac leaders.
[2:55:44.800 --> 2:55:49.800]  And so they wanted to give people money that was completely outside the system.
[2:55:49.800 --> 2:55:56.800]  So in similar the way Alex Jones operates outside of traditional media and cover stories that are not being covered.
[2:55:56.800 --> 2:56:00.800]  Bitcoin operates outside the entire global monetary system.
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:10.800]  And for the first time in history, what is Bitcoin able to do is create hard money that does not need a third party like a bank for us to transact.
[2:56:10.800 --> 2:56:13.800]  You and I can transact completely independent of a bank.
[2:56:13.800 --> 2:56:16.800]  That's revolutionary. It's never been possible before.
[2:56:16.800 --> 2:56:20.800]  And it's indestructible. It's uncensorable.
[2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:27.800]  And this is our, as Christine Lagarde said a week ago, she said Bitcoin is an escape hatch.
[2:56:27.800 --> 2:56:29.800]  And she said she has to try to stop it.
[2:56:29.800 --> 2:56:32.800]  Well, she's never going to stop it.
[2:56:32.800 --> 2:56:36.800]  And she's running an escape hatch.
[2:56:36.800 --> 2:56:40.800]  And the ECMF and the World Bank and the central banks.
[2:56:40.800 --> 2:56:45.800]  It is the only real Bible escape hatch we have right now, Alex.
[2:56:45.800 --> 2:56:50.800]  Very powerful, Max. Where do people find Max Kaiser?
[2:56:50.800 --> 2:56:52.800]  Go to Twitter.
[2:56:52.800 --> 2:56:56.800]  It's the easiest to find me on Twitter. Max Kaiser on Twitter.
[2:56:56.800 --> 2:57:03.800]  Plus on YouTube, we've got the orange pill channel, you know, youtube.com forward slash orange pill.
[2:57:03.800 --> 2:57:08.800]  That's our YouTube channel where we do all of our various content and things like that.
[2:57:08.800 --> 2:57:15.800]  And of course, I see over there at swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex.
[2:57:15.800 --> 2:57:18.800]  It's hot. You know, people are banging that thing.
[2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:24.800]  You're listeners because you get 10 bucks free, Bitcoin for free when you register.
[2:57:24.800 --> 2:57:27.800]  And then from there, you know, you see what you want to do.
[2:57:27.800 --> 2:57:36.800]  I say only keep money in fiat that you can afford to lose because they're going to take it all through inflation.
[2:57:36.800 --> 2:57:42.800]  All right, Max, we really appreciate you and we appreciate you reaching out to your audience with our audience.
[2:57:42.800 --> 2:57:45.800]  We're all in this together. Thank you so much. There goes Max Kaiser.
[2:57:45.800 --> 2:57:47.800]  Another special guest joins us.
[2:57:47.800 --> 2:57:51.800]  I've been thinking a lot lately about playing devil's advocate on there.
[2:57:51.800 --> 2:57:56.800]  About looking at the world from the perspective of the globalist that the public's so dumbed down
[2:57:56.800 --> 2:57:59.800]  that they don't care that we're stealing their future from them, that we're poisoning them,
[2:57:59.800 --> 2:58:03.800]  that we're sterilizing them, then they deserve to be killed.
[2:58:03.800 --> 2:58:06.800]  Yes, that's the position of the globalist. They play God.
[2:58:06.800 --> 2:58:10.800]  And they think because we don't stand up, they have a right to do this to us.
[2:58:10.800 --> 2:58:15.800]  You know, I've told you that the globalist who tried to hire me, they try to get me to join them.
[2:58:15.800 --> 2:58:19.800]  But metaphysically at a spiritual level, I have the whole of spirit.
[2:58:19.800 --> 2:58:22.800]  I'm connection to God. And I know that God does not like that.
[2:58:22.800 --> 2:58:24.800]  So I cannot join the enemy.
[2:58:24.800 --> 2:58:29.800]  But I'll tell you, at a selfish level, I get very, very mad at people that go along with the system,
[2:58:29.800 --> 2:58:33.800]  believing you're part of it or believing you're getting power on them.
[2:58:33.800 --> 2:58:38.800]  Whether you're just a steelworker or a schoolteacher or a Henry Kissinger, you're not God.
[2:58:38.800 --> 2:58:45.800]  And treating other people like they're animals and you're God is something that the real God of the Universe doesn't like.
[2:58:45.800 --> 2:58:48.800]  And that's a fact.
[2:58:48.800 --> 2:58:51.800]  We shall go on to the end.
[2:58:51.800 --> 2:58:53.800]  We shall fight in France.
[2:58:53.800 --> 2:58:56.800]  We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
[2:58:56.800 --> 2:59:02.800]  We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
[2:59:02.800 --> 2:59:06.800]  We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[2:59:06.800 --> 2:59:08.800]  We shall fight on the beaches.
[2:59:08.800 --> 2:59:11.800]  We shall fight on the landing grounds.
[2:59:11.800 --> 2:59:15.800]  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
[2:59:15.800 --> 2:59:17.800]  We shall fight in the hills.
[2:59:17.800 --> 2:59:27.800]  We shall never surrender.
[2:59:47.800 --> 2:59:50.800]  Are we still here today?
[2:59:50.800 --> 2:59:52.800]  Amazing.
[2:59:52.800 --> 2:59:57.800]  Here's some of the headlines coming up after our next guest leaves us.
[2:59:57.800 --> 3:00:07.800]  Arkansas Governor Asa Hushin cites principles of Ronald Reagan to defend castration of children.
[3:00:07.800 --> 3:00:09.800]  Yeah, we wear burka masks now.
[3:00:09.800 --> 3:00:11.800]  We don't just chop little girls' windows off.
[3:00:11.800 --> 3:00:13.800]  We chop little boys' windows off.
[3:00:13.800 --> 3:00:18.800]  What a sick group of weird, virtue signaling freaks.
[3:00:18.800 --> 3:00:23.800]  The government study glows vaccine passports imminent.
[3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:25.800]  And it just goes on and on.
[3:00:25.800 --> 3:00:27.800]  We'll be covering that.
[3:00:27.800 --> 3:00:38.800]  But right now, joining us is a great investigative reporter from nationalfile.com, Patrick Howley.
[3:00:38.800 --> 3:00:43.800]  And it's not like they just do this as a one-off.
[3:00:43.800 --> 3:00:50.800]  Every week, they're exposing some Republican or Democrat for their bizarre, fake behavior.
[3:00:50.800 --> 3:00:59.800]  And showing the type of weirdness that these people are involved in pretty much to a man or a woman.
[3:00:59.800 --> 3:01:02.800]  So, explosives, basically, they're picking off the rhinos.
[3:01:02.800 --> 3:01:05.800]  That's a very valuable thing for America and the world.
[3:01:05.800 --> 3:01:12.800]  Alabama Senate contender had an extramarital affair exchanged sex about anal play with ex-lover,
[3:01:12.800 --> 3:01:17.800]  who he would reportedly have sex with while his wife was gone, in the bedroom, the marital bed.
[3:01:17.800 --> 3:01:21.800]  So, again, that's just beyond.
[3:01:21.800 --> 3:01:22.800]  That's a bizarre.
[3:01:22.800 --> 3:01:26.800]  There he is, best buddies with John McCain.
[3:01:26.800 --> 3:01:30.800]  And so, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill.
[3:01:30.800 --> 3:01:39.800]  Let's take a run for the U.S. Senate, had an extramarital affair last year with his mistress.
[3:01:39.800 --> 3:01:42.800]  And it goes on to lay it all out.
[3:01:42.800 --> 3:01:46.800]  So, Patrick Howley joins us right now.
[3:01:46.800 --> 3:01:47.800]  Why is this important?
[3:01:47.800 --> 3:01:54.800]  Why is it important to drill down the fact that he's doing stuff with his mistress, Patrick?
[3:01:54.800 --> 3:02:00.800]  Well, John Merrill Alex is somebody who presents himself as a family man, as a Christian family man.
[3:02:00.800 --> 3:02:04.800]  That's the image that he projects to the people in his state.
[3:02:04.800 --> 3:02:07.800]  And yet, meanwhile, he's a total degenerate behind the scenes.
[3:02:07.800 --> 3:02:10.800]  He's using government taxpayer money to carry out his affair.
[3:02:10.800 --> 3:02:13.800]  And he has been totally and utterly caught.
[3:02:13.800 --> 3:02:14.800]  He's been totally disgraced.
[3:02:14.800 --> 3:02:22.800]  He was in panic mode, meltdown mode last night, coming up with a statement in which he admitted to having a long texting relationship with this woman.
[3:02:22.800 --> 3:02:24.800]  Everybody knows that this is true.
[3:02:24.800 --> 3:02:29.800]  We have many, many people who are finally glad that it's coming out.
[3:02:29.800 --> 3:02:35.800]  And today, President Donald Trump has endorsed Mo Brooks, the America First candidate who is running.
[3:02:35.800 --> 3:02:38.800]  John Merrill, of course, was the establishment peck to try to stop Mo Brooks.
[3:02:38.800 --> 3:02:44.800]  But the Trump camp is very satisfied now after this story came out that Mo Brooks is the guy to go with.
[3:02:44.800 --> 3:02:50.800]  And that's why it's important is that if we know about this, the globalists know about it.
[3:02:50.800 --> 3:02:53.800]  We're going to blackmail him, so let's get it all out of the open.
[3:02:53.800 --> 3:02:57.800]  If somebody has a great record of patriotism or whatever, people overlook this kind of stuff.
[3:02:57.800 --> 3:03:02.800]  But if they're a little rhino rat person, we know they're being compromised with it.
[3:03:02.800 --> 3:03:04.800]  This is Yeoman's work.
[3:03:04.800 --> 3:03:06.800]  This is God's work here.
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:07.800]  This guy's a hypocrite.
[3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:08.800]  He's a fraud.
[3:03:08.800 --> 3:03:11.800]  He claims this is super squeaky clean Christian.
[3:03:11.800 --> 3:03:16.800]  And again, he's doing this on taxpayer dime.
[3:03:16.800 --> 3:03:23.800]  I mean, hauling the mistress around right next door to his wife also shows a form of recklessness.
[3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:24.800]  Yeah, that's right.
[3:03:24.800 --> 3:03:31.800]  And it shows a duality in his personality whereby, you know, think about what a sociopath you have to be to go around
[3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:38.800]  and create this image of yourself that's not true and then snap back into something else as soon as the cameras are off.
[3:03:38.800 --> 3:03:40.800]  These are the kinds of psychopaths who rule us.
[3:03:40.800 --> 3:03:45.800]  And these are the kinds of psychopaths who have decayed our entire society and led us to ruin.
[3:03:45.800 --> 3:03:50.800]  And so these are the kinds of people who need to be exposed when people are lying sociopaths.
[3:03:50.800 --> 3:03:57.800]  And by the way, this guy now has been accused of being in physical fights with his mistress where, you know, she had bruises on her.
[3:03:57.800 --> 3:04:01.800]  She took a belt buckle and hit his taxpayer funded car.
[3:04:01.800 --> 3:04:05.800]  And so this guy just, there's so much blackmail material out there.
[3:04:05.800 --> 3:04:10.800]  And this is a guy who's in a position as Secretary of State who is going for the U.S. Senate.
[3:04:10.800 --> 3:04:16.800]  And I don't believe that he's going to run at this point. They've delayed his announcement now after this story.
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:17.800]  Sure. Well, great job.
[3:04:17.800 --> 3:04:20.800]  He's not a good conservative compared to the other candidate, as you said.
[3:04:20.800 --> 3:04:21.800]  So that's very, very excited.
[3:04:21.800 --> 3:04:24.800]  We can pick these people off very, very easily because of their backgrounds.
[3:04:24.800 --> 3:04:25.800]  And of course, that's some of the iceberg.
[3:04:25.800 --> 3:04:32.800]  How do you continue to get the diary of Joe Biden's daughter?
[3:04:32.800 --> 3:04:37.800]  How do you continue to get all of this if you're really kicking ass?
[3:04:37.800 --> 3:04:40.800]  You were right about the laptop. You're right about the diary.
[3:04:40.800 --> 3:04:42.800]  You guys have been at the cutting edge of this.
[3:04:42.800 --> 3:04:44.800]  How are you doing that?
[3:04:44.800 --> 3:04:46.800]  Well, I just work all the time and I talk to a lot of people.
[3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:48.800]  I do what the press doesn't do.
[3:04:48.800 --> 3:04:51.800]  The press sits around and they wait for a press statement or they wait for him.
[3:04:51.800 --> 3:04:53.800]  Sure, they wait for a big story already.
[3:04:53.800 --> 3:04:57.800]  Right. And then, you know, but meanwhile, I'm out there.
[3:04:57.800 --> 3:04:58.800]  I have all the information.
[3:04:58.800 --> 3:05:03.800]  And that's why the Republicans are trying to suck up to me right now because they don't want to get John Merrill.
[3:05:03.800 --> 3:05:06.800]  They don't want to have buttplug stuff out there about them forever.
[3:05:06.800 --> 3:05:09.800]  They don't want, you know, a diary out there getting out there.
[3:05:09.800 --> 3:05:11.800]  So they're trying to be nice to me right now.
[3:05:11.800 --> 3:05:13.800]  But I'm not in a nice mode, Alex.
[3:05:13.800 --> 3:05:16.800]  I'm not in a nice mode at all because what we're doing going into 2022.
[3:05:16.800 --> 3:05:18.800]  America First is uncompromising.
[3:05:18.800 --> 3:05:19.800]  We've got to meet.
[3:05:19.800 --> 3:05:21.800]  This is total war.
[3:05:21.800 --> 3:05:22.800]  I feel the same way.
[3:05:22.800 --> 3:05:23.800]  Absolutely.
[3:05:23.800 --> 3:05:24.800]  We're not going to compromise.
[3:05:24.800 --> 3:05:26.800]  We're going to accelerate our attack.
[3:05:26.800 --> 3:05:27.800]  That's right. 100%.
[3:05:27.800 --> 3:05:31.800]  And just moments ago, Alex, I just broke a new story about Nancy Pelosi.
[3:05:31.800 --> 3:05:38.800]  Nancy Pelosi personally renting office space to a group that is connected to pedophilia,
[3:05:38.800 --> 3:05:41.800]  that a group that is connected to child porn,
[3:05:41.800 --> 3:05:45.800]  a group that was designed by notorious monstrous pedophile.
[3:05:45.800 --> 3:05:46.800]  Okay.
[3:05:46.800 --> 3:05:52.800]  And at the time that this man was at large designing this group that Nancy Pelosi personally rents office space to.
[3:05:52.800 --> 3:05:54.800]  Why am I not surprised?
[3:05:54.800 --> 3:06:01.800]  Here it is.
[3:06:01.800 --> 3:06:03.800]  Nancy Pelosi rents office space to group designed by pedophile connected to pedophilia and child porn.
[3:06:03.800 --> 3:06:09.800]  Then we have massive child trafficking Senate report with Democrats placing children with known sex traffickers.
[3:06:09.800 --> 3:06:12.800]  I mean, these people are obsessed with children.
[3:06:12.800 --> 3:06:13.800]  Yep.
[3:06:13.800 --> 3:06:17.800]  And this is, you know, I peeled apart exactly what's going on in California.
[3:06:17.800 --> 3:06:21.800]  We're, by the way, they don't even put out an Amber Alert when a foster child goes missing.
[3:06:21.800 --> 3:06:23.800]  They count them all as runaways, of course.
[3:06:23.800 --> 3:06:30.800]  So, you know, you can look at this article and you can see how Dr. William Ayers was connected to a guy who was working at Hillcrest Juvenile Center,
[3:06:30.800 --> 3:06:34.800]  who was later arrested, 470 images of naked boys.
[3:06:34.800 --> 3:06:35.800]  Okay.
[3:06:35.800 --> 3:06:42.800]  You can look at all of the connections that Nancy Pelosi has to these people in San Mateo and that Joe Biden has to these people,
[3:06:42.800 --> 3:06:49.800]  including Joe Cotchett, who is, has been accused by his ex-wife of being nude around his daughters.
[3:06:49.800 --> 3:06:51.800]  These are sick, sick people.
[3:06:51.800 --> 3:06:53.800]  And this all goes through California.
[3:06:53.800 --> 3:06:58.800]  And they are loving what's going on on the border right now because the more children that get pumped into this country,
[3:06:58.800 --> 3:07:00.800]  the more children they can cycle through their programs.
[3:07:00.800 --> 3:07:06.800]  And it takes a village social control that they are trying to put all of our children into state control.
[3:07:06.800 --> 3:07:10.800]  And once they have them in state control, then a ton of molestation happens.
[3:07:10.800 --> 3:07:15.800]  But if you look at this story, the Pelosi people are already freaking out about it because I have the least.
[3:07:15.800 --> 3:07:19.800]  And I know exactly what's going on at that office space.
[3:07:19.800 --> 3:07:22.800]  I don't know how they survive all the stuff you're doing.
[3:07:22.800 --> 3:07:24.800]  Project Veritas, what we're doing.
[3:07:24.800 --> 3:07:27.800]  I mean, it is over down at the border and starting on viral.
[3:07:27.800 --> 3:07:29.800]  And they're like, there's just buses everywhere.
[3:07:29.800 --> 3:07:31.800]  You can't wait two minutes, one goes by.
[3:07:31.800 --> 3:07:34.800]  There's just little kids being crammed in the back of people's trunks everywhere.
[3:07:34.800 --> 3:07:37.800]  I mean, it's beyond anything you can imagine.
[3:07:37.800 --> 3:07:40.800]  It's beyond any Q and on fever drain.
[3:07:40.800 --> 3:07:47.800]  Child molestation, child prostitution and child trafficking is the core of so much that goes on in our political class.
[3:07:47.800 --> 3:07:49.800]  And it dates back to Alistair Crowley.
[3:07:49.800 --> 3:07:52.800]  It dates back to the ceremonies that these people want to do.
[3:07:52.800 --> 3:07:54.800]  But it's the lifeblood of the criminal attorney.
[3:07:54.800 --> 3:07:59.800]  They believe they get power out of sex magic, but defiling a child still in their essence is their favorite thing.
[3:07:59.800 --> 3:08:02.800]  I know you researched this. Patrick Howley, stay with us.
[3:08:02.800 --> 3:08:05.800]  We're going to come back and talk about this with you.
[3:08:05.800 --> 3:08:07.800]  But you've got two big stories broken.
[3:08:07.800 --> 3:08:11.800]  You've got Alabama Secretary of State, John Buttplug Merrill.
[3:08:11.800 --> 3:08:14.800]  And then you've, I'm sorry, folks, this is what's going on here.
[3:08:14.800 --> 3:08:17.800]  And you've got Angie Pelosi and all her bizarre connections.
[3:08:17.800 --> 3:08:22.800]  These are some sick, evil, freaks, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[3:08:22.800 --> 3:08:23.800]  Some good news.
[3:08:23.800 --> 3:08:27.800]  Vitamin refusion is selling out, but it's still 40% off and it sells out.
[3:08:27.800 --> 3:08:30.800]  We have it at 50% off when you get it with winter sun back in stock.
[3:08:30.800 --> 3:08:32.800]  Highest quality D3 with vitamin K.
[3:08:32.800 --> 3:08:33.800]  You're going to find for your immune system.
[3:08:33.800 --> 3:08:37.800]  Adult children, old people especially, especially black folks, you need it.
[3:08:37.800 --> 3:08:38.800]  It's an infowarstore.com.
[3:08:38.800 --> 3:08:45.800]  It's essential for the right back statements.
[3:08:45.800 --> 3:08:47.800]  The people are awakening.
[3:08:47.800 --> 3:08:49.800]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[3:08:49.800 --> 3:08:51.800]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[3:08:51.800 --> 3:08:54.800]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[3:08:54.800 --> 3:08:58.800]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments,
[3:08:58.800 --> 3:09:03.800]  the CHIComs especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data,
[3:09:03.800 --> 3:09:07.800]  to be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data
[3:09:07.800 --> 3:09:12.800]  that can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[3:09:12.800 --> 3:09:18.800]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[3:09:18.800 --> 3:09:20.800]  In their own words, they admit it.
[3:09:20.800 --> 3:09:23.800]  So, I've been selling privacy pouches and block it,
[3:09:23.800 --> 3:09:25.800]  block it and things like that for more than a decade.
[3:09:25.800 --> 3:09:27.800]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[3:09:27.800 --> 3:09:28.800]  They're Faraday cages.
[3:09:28.800 --> 3:09:30.800]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[3:09:30.800 --> 3:09:31.800]  They work absolutely great.
[3:09:31.800 --> 3:09:35.800]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data
[3:09:35.800 --> 3:09:38.800]  and power over your identity when you are traveling
[3:09:38.800 --> 3:09:40.800]  and don't want big brother to know what you're up to
[3:09:40.800 --> 3:09:41.800]  because it's not their business.

[3:10:24.800 --> 3:10:26.800]  The supply chains are breaking down.

[3:10:27.800 --> 3:10:30.800]  We couldn't even get it because getting high quality ingredients
[3:10:30.800 --> 3:10:32.800]  is very, very hard and we're not going to cut corners.

[3:10:51.800 --> 3:10:54.800]  Thanks for watching.
[3:11:21.800 --> 3:11:25.800]  Thanks for watching.
[3:11:51.800 --> 3:11:54.800]  Also just had the video go live at band.video.
[3:11:54.800 --> 3:11:59.800]  So again, General Flynn calls for investigation of SPARS 2025-2028.
[3:11:59.800 --> 3:12:01.800]  It really is a blueprint of what's happening.
[3:12:01.800 --> 3:12:03.800]  I want to ask Patrick Howley, a really smart investigative journalist,
[3:12:03.800 --> 3:12:06.800]  his take on the ongoing COVID lockdowns next segment.
[3:12:06.800 --> 3:12:09.800]  But now, getting back to you, big picture.
[3:12:09.800 --> 3:12:10.800]  These are big stories you broke.
[3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:12.800]  It shows how the Republicans are compromised.
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:17.800]  It's almost always the rhino, the neocon, that's the pervert,
[3:12:17.800 --> 3:12:20.800]  that's the weirdo, that's the pedophile.
[3:12:20.800 --> 3:12:24.800]  But then we get attacked by 60 Minutes.
[3:12:24.800 --> 3:12:26.800]  We get attacked by Comedy Central.
[3:12:26.800 --> 3:12:31.800]  We get attacked by Saturday Night Live on NBC.
[3:12:31.800 --> 3:12:34.800]  Then, oh, but when Matt Gaetz is a sex traveler, we don't care.
[3:12:34.800 --> 3:12:36.800]  Hey, if he's caught doing something with 17-year-olds,
[3:12:36.800 --> 3:12:37.800]  that's wrong.
[3:12:37.800 --> 3:12:38.800]  He should get into some trouble.
[3:12:38.800 --> 3:12:39.800]  There's no proof of that.
[3:12:39.800 --> 3:12:42.800]  But it's not little kids on Lilia Express.
[3:12:42.800 --> 3:12:45.800]  OK, so yeah, that comes out and he's lying.
[3:12:45.800 --> 3:12:46.800]  Good burning, burning.
[3:12:46.800 --> 3:12:47.800]  I don't give a damn.
[3:12:47.800 --> 3:12:48.800]  But it's not, that's not the case.
[3:12:48.800 --> 3:12:50.800]  Like, oh, look, child trafficking, Matt Gaetz,
[3:12:50.800 --> 3:12:53.800]  thinking that's going to confuse us away from the UN
[3:12:53.800 --> 3:12:54.800]  and all these five-year-olds.
[3:12:54.800 --> 3:12:58.800]  And the massive industrial scale of Tony Podesta
[3:12:58.800 --> 3:13:00.800]  in the Washington Post 2007,
[3:13:00.800 --> 3:13:03.800]  showing off his pedophilia collection.
[3:13:03.800 --> 3:13:05.800]  These are, this is an apples and oranges.
[3:13:05.800 --> 3:13:07.800]  This is universes different.
[3:13:07.800 --> 3:13:09.800]  Give me your take on that.
[3:13:09.800 --> 3:13:12.800]  Well, Alex, as we all know, the globalist elites,
[3:13:12.800 --> 3:13:13.800]  the people who are in power,
[3:13:13.800 --> 3:13:15.800]  are absolutely melting down right now
[3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:17.800]  because we continue to expose
[3:13:17.800 --> 3:13:19.800]  their demonic pedophilia.
[3:13:19.800 --> 3:13:21.800]  And when you have Nancy Pelosi,
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:23.800]  as I've just reported at nationalfile.com,
[3:13:23.800 --> 3:13:24.800]  and I have the lease,
[3:13:24.800 --> 3:13:26.800]  and I have all the documents dating back years,
[3:13:26.800 --> 3:13:29.800]  when you have her personally renting off the space,
[3:13:29.800 --> 3:13:32.800]  giving a safe space to a group
[3:13:32.800 --> 3:13:35.800]  that was designed by a monstrous, notorious pedophile
[3:13:35.800 --> 3:13:37.800]  who many people in San Mateo knew
[3:13:37.800 --> 3:13:39.800]  that he was molesting kids.
[3:13:39.800 --> 3:13:40.800]  He was a child psychiatrist,
[3:13:40.800 --> 3:13:42.800]  and so they would pretend that kids in school
[3:13:42.800 --> 3:13:44.800]  were suicidal in order to send...
[3:13:44.800 --> 3:13:45.800]  And that came out of DW.
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:47.800]  That came out of the biggest German news
[3:13:47.800 --> 3:13:48.800]  last year and this year.
[3:13:48.800 --> 3:13:50.800]  Tens of thousands of children
[3:13:50.800 --> 3:13:52.800]  by government psychiatrists placed with pedophiles
[3:13:52.800 --> 3:13:53.800]  in mass rape rings.
[3:13:53.800 --> 3:13:55.800]  That's who's running this.
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:13:57.800]  Yeah, and it was going on right in California
[3:13:57.800 --> 3:13:58.800]  with Dr. William Ayers,
[3:13:58.800 --> 3:14:00.800]  and he was molesting the kids.
[3:14:00.800 --> 3:14:02.800]  The police had been tipped off to this.
[3:14:02.800 --> 3:14:04.800]  There was a police report, you know,
[3:14:04.800 --> 3:14:05.800]  and everybody knew about this.
[3:14:05.800 --> 3:14:07.800]  There were numerous, numerous allegations
[3:14:07.800 --> 3:14:08.800]  dating back years.
[3:14:08.800 --> 3:14:10.800]  And then here's this group that he designed,
[3:14:10.800 --> 3:14:13.800]  which is now basically running everything
[3:14:13.800 --> 3:14:15.800]  that goes on with child trafficking in California
[3:14:15.800 --> 3:14:18.800]  in terms of protecting child protective services,
[3:14:18.800 --> 3:14:19.800]  which is taking kids away
[3:14:19.800 --> 3:14:22.800]  and putting them into the foster care system.
[3:14:22.800 --> 3:14:24.800]  You know, we're talking about family court judges.
[3:14:24.800 --> 3:14:26.800]  We're talking about everything that goes on
[3:14:26.800 --> 3:14:27.800]  that protects...
[3:14:27.800 --> 3:14:29.800]  Oh, by the way, how many family court judges
[3:14:29.800 --> 3:14:31.800]  the last few months in Florida and Texas
[3:14:31.800 --> 3:14:34.800]  and Wisconsin and Illinois and...
[3:14:34.800 --> 3:14:36.800]  It was Idaho.
[3:14:36.800 --> 3:14:37.800]  They're all being busted running
[3:14:37.800 --> 3:14:40.800]  giant child kidnapping rings and pervert rings.
[3:14:40.800 --> 3:14:42.800]  I'm sure you've seen that.
[3:14:42.800 --> 3:14:45.800]  The family courts protect this entire system,
[3:14:45.800 --> 3:14:46.800]  and they protect the system
[3:14:46.800 --> 3:14:47.800]  in which child protective services
[3:14:47.800 --> 3:14:49.800]  can take the kids away with basically
[3:14:49.800 --> 3:14:51.800]  no even allegations sometimes,
[3:14:51.800 --> 3:14:52.800]  for no reason.
[3:14:52.800 --> 3:14:55.800]  Literally, these people are judge, jury,
[3:14:55.800 --> 3:14:57.800]  and human trafficker when it comes to these children.
[3:14:57.800 --> 3:15:00.800]  So when you've got Pelosi at the center
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:01.800]  of something like this,
[3:15:01.800 --> 3:15:03.800]  now this is a group that has partnered with
[3:15:03.800 --> 3:15:06.800]  an organization that runs group houses
[3:15:06.800 --> 3:15:08.800]  where little kids were being molested.
[3:15:08.800 --> 3:15:10.800]  This is a group that partners with
[3:15:10.800 --> 3:15:13.800]  a conflict resolution center where a volunteer
[3:15:13.800 --> 3:15:17.800]  had 470 images of naked boys
[3:15:17.800 --> 3:15:18.800]  and was convicted,
[3:15:18.800 --> 3:15:20.800]  and it turns out that he knew Dr. William Ares
[3:15:20.800 --> 3:15:22.800]  going back years when Dr. William Ares...
[3:15:22.800 --> 3:15:23.800]  And let's be clear, though,
[3:15:23.800 --> 3:15:25.800]  we're showing articles for even CNN and Fox News.
[3:15:25.800 --> 3:15:29.800]  Some of these judges are running kidnapped children.
[3:15:29.800 --> 3:15:31.800]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:15:31.800 --> 3:15:33.800]  This is 100% what's happening,
[3:15:33.800 --> 3:15:35.800]  and the courts are complicit in it.
[3:15:35.800 --> 3:15:36.800]  So get back to Alistair Crowley,
[3:15:36.800 --> 3:15:37.800]  because you're right.
[3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:40.800]  And Alistair Crowley, out of other people
[3:15:40.800 --> 3:15:41.800]  found in Hollywood,
[3:15:41.800 --> 3:15:43.800]  for those that don't know, that's mainline history,
[3:15:43.800 --> 3:15:45.800]  explain Alistair Crowley why he's so important
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:46.800]  in the WikiLeaks.
[3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:48.800]  They worship him.
[3:15:48.800 --> 3:15:49.800]  Alistair Crowley is the people
[3:15:49.800 --> 3:15:51.800]  that the Satanic Luciferians worship.
[3:15:51.800 --> 3:15:54.800]  And Alistair Crowley believed in his books about magic
[3:15:54.800 --> 3:15:57.800]  that sacrificing young children
[3:15:57.800 --> 3:15:58.800]  and molesting young children,
[3:15:58.800 --> 3:16:00.800]  particularly young boys,
[3:16:00.800 --> 3:16:03.800]  gave some kind of demonic energy.
[3:16:03.800 --> 3:16:05.800]  It gives off some kind of demonic energy
[3:16:05.800 --> 3:16:08.800]  that he thought would please Lucifer.
[3:16:08.800 --> 3:16:11.800]  And so when you have, of course, Bohemian Grove,
[3:16:11.800 --> 3:16:13.800]  and by the way, Bohemian Grove is extremely influential
[3:16:13.800 --> 3:16:16.800]  in California, particularly in San Mateo.
[3:16:16.800 --> 3:16:19.800]  Nancy Pelosi's husband is a key member of Bohemian Grove.
[3:16:19.800 --> 3:16:22.800]  They couldn't go to do their ceremony this year.
[3:16:22.800 --> 3:16:25.800]  So maybe they were able to worship Malik via Skype
[3:16:25.800 --> 3:16:27.800]  during the COVID lockdown.
[3:16:27.800 --> 3:16:30.800]  But Bohemian Grove is running a lot of this kind of stuff.
[3:16:30.800 --> 3:16:33.800]  And Alistair Crowley is the person who they worship.
[3:16:33.800 --> 3:16:35.800]  He was on the front of the
[3:16:35.800 --> 3:16:37.800]  Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band Album
[3:16:37.800 --> 3:16:39.800]  in the Summer of Love in the 1960s.
[3:16:39.800 --> 3:16:42.800]  And he is the person who has basically
[3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:45.800]  written the rule book on these people
[3:16:45.800 --> 3:16:46.800]  and molesting children.
[3:16:46.800 --> 3:16:49.800]  And they don't seem to think that there's anything wrong with it
[3:16:49.800 --> 3:16:51.800]  because it's part of their religion.
[3:16:51.800 --> 3:16:53.800]  Well, it's part of their arrogance
[3:16:53.800 --> 3:16:56.800]  and their selfishness to seal somebody's future.
[3:16:56.800 --> 3:16:58.800]  Yes, and to traumatize these kids.
[3:16:58.800 --> 3:17:00.800]  And when you look at so many young people
[3:17:00.800 --> 3:17:02.800]  who have committed suicide after having been molested,
[3:17:02.800 --> 3:17:04.800]  so many young people have been getting killed.
[3:17:04.800 --> 3:17:06.800]  Well, look at the whole transsexual thing,
[3:17:06.800 --> 3:17:08.800]  convincing usually an autistic boy
[3:17:08.800 --> 3:17:10.800]  when he's seven to have his genitals cut off or chemically.
[3:17:10.800 --> 3:17:12.800]  That's worse than raping him.
[3:17:12.800 --> 3:17:14.800]  They're literally chopping their testicles off,
[3:17:14.800 --> 3:17:15.800]  calling it liberal.
[3:17:15.800 --> 3:17:17.800]  I mean, they cut our children's,
[3:17:17.800 --> 3:17:20.800]  imagine a ceremony where they chop boys' testicles off.
[3:17:20.800 --> 3:17:23.800]  Well, this is done publicly.
[3:17:23.800 --> 3:17:25.800]  You know, the Democrat elites
[3:17:25.800 --> 3:17:27.800]  in the age of Hillary Clinton,
[3:17:27.800 --> 3:17:29.800]  in the age of globalism, in the age of Nancy Pelosi
[3:17:29.800 --> 3:17:31.800]  have so much to answer for.
[3:17:31.800 --> 3:17:33.800]  And, you know, when you look at the...
[3:17:33.800 --> 3:17:35.800]  Well, that was my next question.
[3:17:35.800 --> 3:17:37.800]  What the hell is going to happen to them?
[3:17:37.800 --> 3:17:39.800]  The wheels have come off.
[3:17:39.800 --> 3:17:41.800]  They are, like, totally exposed.
[3:17:41.800 --> 3:17:43.800]  They are totally 100% exposed.
[3:17:43.800 --> 3:17:45.800]  And, you know, they're panicking.
[3:17:45.800 --> 3:17:47.800]  We're going to keep getting the truth out there.
[3:17:47.800 --> 3:17:49.800]  I have vowed to expose a new politician
[3:17:49.800 --> 3:17:51.800]  or media figure every single day, one per day.
[3:17:51.800 --> 3:17:53.800]  So yesterday, I took down Alabama Secretary of State
[3:17:53.800 --> 3:17:55.800]  John Merrill, a Republican.
[3:17:55.800 --> 3:17:57.800]  Today, I've exposed Nancy Pelosi.
[3:17:57.800 --> 3:17:59.800]  My next person who I'm exposing
[3:17:59.800 --> 3:18:01.800]  is the Democrat Congresswoman
[3:18:01.800 --> 3:18:03.800]  who held events with sheriffs
[3:18:03.800 --> 3:18:05.800]  who have been caught
[3:18:05.800 --> 3:18:07.800]  inside of a brothel
[3:18:07.800 --> 3:18:09.800]  in Las Vegas, okay,
[3:18:09.800 --> 3:18:11.800]  with illegal immigrant
[3:18:11.800 --> 3:18:13.800]  sex slaves.
[3:18:13.800 --> 3:18:15.800]  And this is Democrat Congresswoman Jackie Spear
[3:18:15.800 --> 3:18:17.800]  who is intimately involved
[3:18:17.800 --> 3:18:19.800]  with these people who have been caught
[3:18:19.800 --> 3:18:21.800]  in a federal sting called Operation Dollhouse.
[3:18:21.800 --> 3:18:23.800]  So that's going to be the next person I expose.
[3:18:23.800 --> 3:18:25.800]  Every single day, I'm going to expose a new one.
[3:18:25.800 --> 3:18:27.800]  And we are not going to stop
[3:18:27.800 --> 3:18:29.800]  until these people all resign
[3:18:29.800 --> 3:18:31.800]  or until America First is restored
[3:18:31.800 --> 3:18:33.800]  at the ballot box in 2022.
[3:18:33.800 --> 3:18:35.800]  And I know people are cynical about the ballot box,
[3:18:35.800 --> 3:18:37.800]  but you know what, we are fixing
[3:18:37.800 --> 3:18:39.800]  the election system right now.
[3:18:39.800 --> 3:18:41.800]  We're doing everything we possibly can in Georgia and Arizona.
[3:18:41.800 --> 3:18:43.800]  Let's talk about that next, because all we're asking for
[3:18:43.800 --> 3:18:45.800]  is having an ID.
[3:18:45.800 --> 3:18:47.800]  I mean, the idea that
[3:18:47.800 --> 3:18:49.800]  that's racist is preposterous.
[3:18:49.800 --> 3:18:51.800]  Yep, and we're going to win these elections.
[3:18:51.800 --> 3:18:53.800]  We are absolutely going to win these elections.
[3:18:53.800 --> 3:18:55.800]  We're going to throw out the incumbents.
[3:18:55.800 --> 3:18:57.800]  We're not the time to give up.
[3:18:57.800 --> 3:18:59.800]  Now is the time to make sure that these people
[3:18:59.800 --> 3:19:01.800]  who are exposed are thrown out of power.
[3:19:01.800 --> 3:19:03.800]  I agree with you that these
[3:19:03.800 --> 3:19:05.800]  attacks and all this demonization
[3:19:05.800 --> 3:19:07.800]  and all this censorship
[3:19:07.800 --> 3:19:09.800]  is a sign of the enemy's weakness, not restraint.
[3:19:09.800 --> 3:19:11.800]  Absolutely, 100%.
[3:19:11.800 --> 3:19:13.800]  That's why they're so desperate.
[3:19:13.800 --> 3:19:15.800]  Well, we're getting a lot of whistleblowers,
[3:19:15.800 --> 3:19:17.800]  but I always tell people, give them to Patrick Halley
[3:19:17.800 --> 3:19:19.800]  over at nationalfile.com, give them to Project Veritas.
[3:19:19.800 --> 3:19:21.800]  I'm trying to hire more crew.
[3:19:21.800 --> 3:19:23.800]  We're overwhelmed. Keep some of your tips to us, too.
[3:19:23.800 --> 3:19:25.800]  What's going on is Veritas
[3:19:25.800 --> 3:19:27.800]  to tell you how the tips come from our great audience,
[3:19:27.800 --> 3:19:29.800]  but man, the whistleblowers we got now
[3:19:29.800 --> 3:19:31.800]  out of the border.
[3:19:31.800 --> 3:19:33.800]  Whoo, baby.
[3:19:33.800 --> 3:19:35.800]  I mean, it's the feds, too.
[3:19:35.800 --> 3:19:37.800]  It's like just, I mean, it's federal marshals.
[3:19:37.800 --> 3:19:39.800]  It's the border patrol.
[3:19:39.800 --> 3:19:41.800]  We have everything. It's about to all come out.
[3:19:41.800 --> 3:19:43.800]  Nothing's going to stop it.
[3:19:43.800 --> 3:19:45.800]  It's going to devastate my...
[3:19:45.800 --> 3:19:47.800]  Oh, yeah, it's confirmed sex trafficking.
[3:19:47.800 --> 3:19:49.800]  You know, listeners call into the show
[3:19:49.800 --> 3:19:51.800]  when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic
[3:19:51.800 --> 3:19:53.800]  there, and I beg you for support constantly
[3:19:53.800 --> 3:19:55.800]  for prayer, for financial support,
[3:19:55.800 --> 3:19:57.800]  and for word of mouth,
[3:19:57.800 --> 3:19:59.800]  and we're all in this together.
[3:19:59.800 --> 3:20:01.800]  You know, it gets old having to come to you and say,
[3:20:01.800 --> 3:20:03.800]  hey, I got great products, please buy them,
[3:20:03.800 --> 3:20:05.800]  or we won't be here on air, but it's true.
[3:20:05.800 --> 3:20:07.800]  We're the only media organization in the United States
[3:20:07.800 --> 3:20:09.800]  that promotes liberty at this level
[3:20:09.800 --> 3:20:11.800]  that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:20:11.800 --> 3:20:13.800]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else.
[3:20:13.800 --> 3:20:15.800]  They've crippled all the other groups,
[3:20:15.800 --> 3:20:17.800]  and we're still here, and as this whole new world order
[3:20:17.800 --> 3:20:19.800]  comes out in the open,
[3:20:19.800 --> 3:20:21.800]  our credibility's going up.
[3:20:21.800 --> 3:20:23.800]  That's why we've got to be taken off air.
[3:20:23.800 --> 3:20:25.800]  That's why America's got to be taken down.
[3:20:25.800 --> 3:20:27.800]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved,
[3:20:27.800 --> 3:20:29.800]  and America's still quasi-free.
[3:20:29.800 --> 3:20:31.800]  You can't have info wars has been proven right
[3:20:31.800 --> 3:20:33.800]  being on air with all the craziness
[3:20:33.800 --> 3:20:35.800]  that's about to unfold.
[3:20:35.800 --> 3:20:37.800]  Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:20:37.800 --> 3:20:39.800]  So thank you all, and get an infowarstore.com,
[3:20:39.800 --> 3:20:41.800]  get some great 2020 election shirts,
[3:20:41.800 --> 3:20:43.800]  supplements and so much more.
[3:20:43.800 --> 3:20:45.800]  They're wonderful products, and they support the info.
[3:20:45.800 --> 3:20:47.800]  We're thanking you.
[3:20:47.800 --> 3:20:49.800]  Look, I've proven
[3:20:49.800 --> 3:20:51.800]  that info wars information
[3:20:51.800 --> 3:20:53.800]  is some of the best in the world.
[3:20:53.800 --> 3:20:55.800]  It's just absolutely on target.
[3:20:55.800 --> 3:20:57.800]  The globalists can't stand us
[3:20:57.800 --> 3:20:59.800]  because we've studied how they operate.
[3:20:59.800 --> 3:21:01.800]  They want to keep you in the dark.
[3:21:01.800 --> 3:21:03.800]  I believe in humanity, and I want to see you empowered
[3:21:03.800 --> 3:21:05.800]  because I know that John F. Kennedy was right.
[3:21:05.800 --> 3:21:07.800]  Our raising tide raises all ships.
[3:21:07.800 --> 3:21:09.800]  Now, the supplements,
[3:21:09.800 --> 3:21:11.800]  the vitamins, the minerals, the compounds we have
[3:21:11.800 --> 3:21:13.800]  at infowarstore.com
[3:21:13.800 --> 3:21:15.800]  are the very best
[3:21:15.800 --> 3:21:17.800]  sourced, wildcrafted, organic
[3:21:17.800 --> 3:21:19.800]  and natural product you're going to find anywhere.
[3:21:19.800 --> 3:21:21.800]  Whether it's natural defense
[3:21:21.800 --> 3:21:23.800]  or whether it's Ultra-12
[3:21:23.800 --> 3:21:25.800]  or whether it's X2 or DNA Force Plus
[3:21:25.800 --> 3:21:27.800]  or Prostagard or Vasobeats,
[3:21:27.800 --> 3:21:29.800]  these are all cutting-edge,
[3:21:29.800 --> 3:21:31.800]  top-of-the-line products
[3:21:31.800 --> 3:21:33.800]  that will help you and your family
[3:21:33.800 --> 3:21:35.800]  at the same time from the info war.
[3:21:35.800 --> 3:21:37.800]  So don't procrastinate.
[3:21:37.800 --> 3:21:45.800]  That's our fashion today at infowarstore.com.
[3:21:45.800 --> 3:21:47.800]  The globalists are purposely collapsing our world.
[3:21:47.800 --> 3:21:49.800]  They are creating insecurity,
[3:21:49.800 --> 3:21:51.800]  crime, war and famine.
[3:21:51.800 --> 3:21:53.800]  All of us should do everything we can
[3:21:53.800 --> 3:21:55.800]  to get prepared and get ready
[3:21:55.800 --> 3:21:57.800]  for ourselves and our family's sakes
[3:21:57.800 --> 3:21:59.800]  but also our community.

[3:22:11.800 --> 3:22:13.800]  but they can never supply enough to our audience.
[3:22:13.800 --> 3:22:15.800]  They have massively expanded their factories.

[3:22:17.800 --> 3:22:19.800]  and they're ready to ship it to you

[3:22:47.800 --> 3:22:49.800]  and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[3:22:49.800 --> 3:22:51.800]  I've been on there 27 years
[3:22:51.800 --> 3:22:53.800]  and only the last year or so have I said that.
[3:22:53.800 --> 3:22:55.800]  But let me tell you, the New World Order
[3:22:55.800 --> 3:22:57.800]  is breathing down our neck.
[3:22:57.800 --> 3:22:59.800]  The big globalist publications are coming after us
[3:22:59.800 --> 3:23:01.800]  and they're doing everything they can to shut us down.
[3:23:01.800 --> 3:23:03.800]  Please pray to keep info wars on the air
[3:23:03.800 --> 3:23:05.800]  and please support the local station
[3:23:05.800 --> 3:23:07.800]  you're listening to as well.
[3:23:07.800 --> 3:23:09.800]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com

[3:23:11.800 --> 3:23:13.800]  get a film, get a t-shirt,
[3:23:13.800 --> 3:23:15.800]  get some supplements because it's that money
[3:23:15.800 --> 3:23:17.800]  that helps us stay on air
[3:23:17.800 --> 3:23:19.800]  in the face of this thing.
[3:23:19.800 --> 3:23:21.800]  I need your help more than ever now.
[3:23:21.800 --> 3:23:23.800]  I want to keep fighting the globalists
[3:23:23.800 --> 3:23:25.800]  but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[3:23:25.800 --> 3:23:27.800]  So pray for us, word of mouth,
[3:23:27.800 --> 3:23:29.800]  tell folks about the broadcast however you can

[3:23:39.800 --> 3:23:41.800]  all of it nurtures the soul.
[3:23:41.800 --> 3:23:43.800]  All of it empowers humanity.
[3:23:43.800 --> 3:23:45.800]  All of it is pro-human and pro-god.
[3:23:45.800 --> 3:24:01.800]  Thank you so much.
[3:24:15.800 --> 3:24:17.800]  You're not a part of this organization?
[3:24:17.800 --> 3:24:19.800]  Who are you?
[3:24:19.800 --> 3:24:21.800]  Where are you taking these kids?
[3:24:21.800 --> 3:24:23.800]  Where are you taking these kids?
[3:24:23.800 --> 3:24:25.800]  Where are you taking these kids?
[3:24:25.800 --> 3:24:27.800]  Sir, identify who you are.
[3:24:27.800 --> 3:24:29.800]  This is a massive smuggling.
[3:24:29.800 --> 3:24:31.800]  This is literally human smuggling.
[3:24:31.800 --> 3:24:59.800]  All right, as of this morning, this video has over 10 million views on different platforms that I've been looking at.
[3:24:59.800 --> 3:25:01.800]  Pulling back from this,
[3:25:01.800 --> 3:25:03.800]  we can talk about the pedophile rings.
[3:25:03.800 --> 3:25:05.800]  We can talk about the Satanism.
[3:25:05.800 --> 3:25:07.800]  We can talk about the WikiLeaks where they say for John Podesta,
[3:25:07.800 --> 3:25:09.800]  we'll have them in a cabin in the woods.
[3:25:09.800 --> 3:25:11.800]  These are 7 to 10-year-old children.
[3:25:11.800 --> 3:25:13.800]  They're going to service you well.
[3:25:13.800 --> 3:25:15.800]  They are misbehaviors. They are children.
[3:25:15.800 --> 3:25:17.800]  They'll be there for your entertainment.
[3:25:17.800 --> 3:25:19.800]  I mean, this is real.
[3:25:19.800 --> 3:25:21.800]  This is bulletproof.
[3:25:21.800 --> 3:25:23.800]  But to be at the border, Patrick,
[3:25:23.800 --> 3:25:25.800]  and to see,
[3:25:25.800 --> 3:25:27.800]  and I was told this yesterday
[3:25:27.800 --> 3:25:29.800]  by Border Patrol and Police.
[3:25:29.800 --> 3:25:31.800]  They said, listen, it's been a million
[3:25:31.800 --> 3:25:33.800]  in the last month here,
[3:25:33.800 --> 3:25:35.800]  not 100,000 in Texas alone.
[3:25:35.800 --> 3:25:37.800]  Well, I didn't know that the Border Patrol had
[3:25:37.800 --> 3:25:39.800]  came out last night and said it's a million
[3:25:39.800 --> 3:25:41.800]  total nationwide the last month.
[3:25:41.800 --> 3:25:43.800]  So they were not making this stuff up.
[3:25:43.800 --> 3:25:45.800]  I mean, it was crazy.
[3:25:45.800 --> 3:25:47.800]  They said this is 10 times anything we ever saw.
[3:25:47.800 --> 3:25:49.800]  And it's literally known human smugglers
[3:25:49.800 --> 3:25:51.800]  and the Senate's own report
[3:25:51.800 --> 3:25:53.800]  admitted the last time this happened under Obama,
[3:25:53.800 --> 3:25:55.800]  10 times worse now,
[3:25:55.800 --> 3:25:57.800]  over 10,000 children got
[3:25:57.800 --> 3:25:59.800]  placed with child sex traffickers.
[3:25:59.800 --> 3:26:01.800]  So this is the big kahuna.
[3:26:01.800 --> 3:26:03.800]  This is the big enchilada.
[3:26:03.800 --> 3:26:05.800]  And I'm like, look at it, buses here, buses there,
[3:26:05.800 --> 3:26:07.800]  children just being packed out,
[3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:09.800]  loaded in the backs of cars,
[3:26:09.800 --> 3:26:11.800]  no IDs, disappearing, my God.
[3:26:11.800 --> 3:26:13.800]  What do you think is going on here,
[3:26:13.800 --> 3:26:15.800]  National File Reporter Patrick Alley?
[3:26:15.800 --> 3:26:17.800]  This is what the idiots,
[3:26:17.800 --> 3:26:19.800]  this is what the morons,
[3:26:19.800 --> 3:26:21.800]  this is what the mask-clad catcarons,
[3:26:21.800 --> 3:26:23.800]  the box-line ants,
[3:26:23.800 --> 3:26:25.800]  because they didn't want to see
[3:26:25.800 --> 3:26:27.800]  Donald Trump's mean tweets anymore
[3:26:27.800 --> 3:26:29.800]  and the media programmed them.
[3:26:29.800 --> 3:26:31.800]  During the Trump administration,
[3:26:31.800 --> 3:26:33.800]  we established the
[3:26:33.800 --> 3:26:35.800]  rapid DNA testing program
[3:26:35.800 --> 3:26:37.800]  at the border, which found that
[3:26:37.800 --> 3:26:39.800]  a vast cross-section of the supposed parents
[3:26:39.800 --> 3:26:41.800]  who were bringing the children up over the border
[3:26:41.800 --> 3:26:43.800]  were not in any way related to the kids.
[3:26:43.800 --> 3:26:45.800]  And some of them knew that they were about
[3:26:45.800 --> 3:26:47.800]  to get caught as human traffickers,
[3:26:47.800 --> 3:26:47.800]  so they said,
[3:26:47.800 --> 3:26:49.800]  asked to the way go and turned around.
[3:26:49.800 --> 3:26:51.800]  Trump had the border basically locked down.
[3:26:51.800 --> 3:26:53.800]  And so what we have here now
[3:26:53.800 --> 3:26:55.800]  is a situation where
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:26:57.800]  the Democrats are inviting these kids
[3:26:57.800 --> 3:26:59.800]  and they're going to spend the rest of their lives
[3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:01.800]  in the criminal underclass,
[3:27:01.800 --> 3:27:03.800]  the criminal economy of this country
[3:27:03.800 --> 3:27:05.800]  that exists below society,
[3:27:05.800 --> 3:27:07.800]  below the streets of Gotham,
[3:27:07.800 --> 3:27:09.800]  and where are these kids going to go?
[3:27:09.800 --> 3:27:11.800]  They're going to be human trafficked.
[3:27:11.800 --> 3:27:13.800]  They are going to end up in gangs.
[3:27:13.800 --> 3:27:15.800]  Many of them are going to end up dead,
[3:27:15.800 --> 3:27:17.800]  because we know...
[3:27:17.800 --> 3:27:19.800]  You're not just saying that most of these people
[3:27:19.800 --> 3:27:21.800]  are killed to carry out crime.
[3:27:21.800 --> 3:27:23.800]  They're literally slaves,
[3:27:23.800 --> 3:27:25.800]  and they will spend the rest of their lives as slaves,
[3:27:25.800 --> 3:27:27.800]  and most of their lives are not going to go very long,
[3:27:27.800 --> 3:27:29.800]  because as soon as they start saying anything
[3:27:29.800 --> 3:27:31.800]  that the authorities
[3:27:31.800 --> 3:27:33.800]  or journalists start picking up on,
[3:27:33.800 --> 3:27:35.800]  then a lot of these kids get killed.
[3:27:35.800 --> 3:27:37.800]  And that's just the sad reality
[3:27:37.800 --> 3:27:39.800]  of the system that the globalists,
[3:27:39.800 --> 3:27:41.800]  like Hillary Clinton, it takes a village
[3:27:41.800 --> 3:27:43.800]  and Nancy Pelosi and these sickos
[3:27:43.800 --> 3:27:45.800]  who are interested in children.
[3:27:45.800 --> 3:27:47.800]  That is the system that they've set up
[3:27:47.800 --> 3:27:49.800]  here in the United States of America,
[3:27:49.800 --> 3:27:51.800]  and we're seeing it now as a crisis on the border
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:53.800]  like never before.
[3:27:53.800 --> 3:27:55.800]  And again, one leftist right over
[3:27:55.800 --> 3:27:57.800]  had said, how dare you embarrass him?
[3:27:57.800 --> 3:27:59.800]  They've been hauled across international lines.
[3:27:59.800 --> 3:28:01.800]  They're being illegally thrown in the back of a trunk.
[3:28:01.800 --> 3:28:03.800]  These are sweet little children.
[3:28:03.800 --> 3:28:05.800]  My heart went out to them. I have a responsibility to this.
[3:28:05.800 --> 3:28:07.800]  You think I want to be in some stinking street
[3:28:07.800 --> 3:28:09.800]  in the heat blocking cars?
[3:28:09.800 --> 3:28:11.800]  I had a responsibility to this.
[3:28:11.800 --> 3:28:13.800]  It goes straight to the top.
[3:28:13.800 --> 3:28:15.800]  You remember that next to him,
[3:28:15.800 --> 3:28:17.800]  he was targeted by Clare Bronfman
[3:28:17.800 --> 3:28:19.800]  of the Bronfman family.
[3:28:19.800 --> 3:28:21.800]  They were giving the kids...
[3:28:21.800 --> 3:28:23.800]  Explain the whole cult was about sucking women dry
[3:28:23.800 --> 3:28:25.800]  until they were all like
[3:28:25.800 --> 3:28:27.800]  amitiated zombies that hated themselves.
[3:28:27.800 --> 3:28:29.800]  It was like a spiritual vampirist cult.
[3:28:29.800 --> 3:28:31.800]  Explain that.
[3:28:31.800 --> 3:28:33.800]  Yes, it was a satanic cult in upstate New York.
[3:28:33.800 --> 3:28:35.800]  Clare Bronfman was illegally bundling money
[3:28:35.800 --> 3:28:37.800]  for Hillary Clinton's campaign.
[3:28:37.800 --> 3:28:39.800]  Richard Mays was the emissary
[3:28:39.800 --> 3:28:41.800]  between the Clintons and this nexium cult.
[3:28:41.800 --> 3:28:43.800]  There was human research being done there
[3:28:43.800 --> 3:28:45.800]  on satanic energy.
[3:28:45.800 --> 3:28:47.800]  They could get out of people by torturing them.
[3:28:47.800 --> 3:28:49.800]  By showing them clockwork orange type stuff.
[3:28:49.800 --> 3:28:51.800]  They hold their eyes open
[3:28:51.800 --> 3:28:53.800]  and showed them torture porn.
[3:28:53.800 --> 3:28:55.800]  Little kids were being subjected
[3:28:55.800 --> 3:28:57.800]  to satanic ceremonies.
[3:28:57.800 --> 3:28:59.800]  They were getting the little kids
[3:28:59.800 --> 3:29:01.800]  from the rainbow cultural gardens
[3:29:01.800 --> 3:29:03.800]  which Clare Bronfman was running
[3:29:03.800 --> 3:29:05.800]  including in Guatemala and Mexico.
[3:29:05.800 --> 3:29:07.800]  They were giving the kids fake visas
[3:29:07.800 --> 3:29:09.800]  getting them up over the border
[3:29:09.800 --> 3:29:11.800]  and shipping them up...
[3:29:11.800 --> 3:29:13.800]  They were torturing them
[3:29:13.800 --> 3:29:15.800]  and they are actually testing.
[3:29:15.800 --> 3:29:17.800]  Let's explain. In the WikiLeaks
[3:29:17.800 --> 3:29:19.800]  they call little brown children
[3:29:19.800 --> 3:29:21.800]  who are sweet little God's angels.
[3:29:21.800 --> 3:29:23.800]  They call them walnuts.
[3:29:23.800 --> 3:29:25.800]  They have code words for everything
[3:29:25.800 --> 3:29:27.800]  and this is how it ties into intel.
[3:29:27.800 --> 3:29:29.800]  They test how much supposed energy
[3:29:29.800 --> 3:29:31.800]  and they call it the data.
[3:29:31.800 --> 3:29:33.800]  How much supposed energy
[3:29:33.800 --> 3:29:35.800]  they can get out of the children
[3:29:35.800 --> 3:29:37.800]  who they're torturing in order to
[3:29:37.800 --> 3:29:39.800]  affect their witchcraft.
[3:29:39.800 --> 3:29:41.800]  They believe that there's some kind of spiritual energy
[3:29:41.800 --> 3:29:43.800]  that they can
[3:29:43.800 --> 3:29:45.800]  calculate, that they can quantify
[3:29:45.800 --> 3:29:47.800]  with their technology.
[3:29:47.800 --> 3:29:49.800]  Larry Nichols told me
[3:29:49.800 --> 3:29:51.800]  that it was a green beret and a CIA drug operative
[3:29:51.800 --> 3:29:53.800]  and also his dad was dying and said
[3:29:53.800 --> 3:29:55.800]  shame on you, you're going to go to hell.
[3:29:55.800 --> 3:29:57.800]  He repented to Christ.
[3:29:57.800 --> 3:29:59.800]  Hillary would say, I'm going to LA
[3:29:59.800 --> 3:30:01.800]  with these rituals to Satanism.
[3:30:01.800 --> 3:30:03.800]  He told me this back in like 96.
[3:30:03.800 --> 3:30:05.800]  It wasn't until a decade later
[3:30:05.800 --> 3:30:07.800]  they were proud of it and released photos
[3:30:07.800 --> 3:30:09.800]  there in LA. It was all true what he said.
[3:30:09.800 --> 3:30:11.800]  I mean, these people are literal devil worshipers.
[3:30:11.800 --> 3:30:13.800]  It's been going on for so long.
[3:30:13.800 --> 3:30:15.800]  You can look into the Franklin cover-up.
[3:30:15.800 --> 3:30:17.800]  You can look into how Johnny Depp
[3:30:17.800 --> 3:30:19.800]  got the West Memphis 3, sprung from prison.
[3:30:19.800 --> 3:30:21.800]  You know, they truly believe
[3:30:21.800 --> 3:30:23.800]  and a lot of this ties into
[3:30:23.800 --> 3:30:25.800]  what goes on at Bohemian Grove,
[3:30:25.800 --> 3:30:27.800]  what goes on at Bilderberg
[3:30:27.800 --> 3:30:29.800]  and a lot of the stuff that you've been saying for a long time
[3:30:29.800 --> 3:30:31.800]  but it all ties into child trafficking
[3:30:31.800 --> 3:30:33.800]  and so much of our society
[3:30:33.800 --> 3:30:35.800]  is structured around this.
[3:30:35.800 --> 3:30:37.800]  There's a lot of complexity
[3:30:37.800 --> 3:30:39.800]  of this operation that Nancy Pelosi
[3:30:39.800 --> 3:30:41.800]  and the people around her have set up
[3:30:41.800 --> 3:30:43.800]  in California to make sure
[3:30:43.800 --> 3:30:45.800]  that there is a culture of separating
[3:30:45.800 --> 3:30:47.800]  children from their parents
[3:30:47.800 --> 3:30:49.800]  and the propaganda now is going to predict
[3:30:49.800 --> 3:30:51.800]  the program, what's happening next
[3:30:51.800 --> 3:30:53.800]  which is that women are only going to be
[3:30:53.800 --> 3:30:55.800]  birthing vessels for the state
[3:30:55.800 --> 3:30:57.800]  and the state is going to raise the children
[3:30:57.800 --> 3:30:59.800]  and it's not going to be one.
[3:30:59.800 --> 3:31:01.800]  Let's expand on that.
[3:31:01.800 --> 3:31:03.800]  If you study
[3:31:03.800 --> 3:31:05.800]  the Mesno America, the Toltecs, the Olmecs
[3:31:05.800 --> 3:31:07.800]  and all them, they would only do a few sacrifices
[3:31:07.800 --> 3:31:09.800]  a year and it was still not good.
[3:31:09.800 --> 3:31:11.800]  The Aztecs, as they began to build up
[3:31:11.800 --> 3:31:13.800]  did more and more but as they collapsed
[3:31:13.800 --> 3:31:15.800]  that's when they started doing tens of thousands
[3:31:15.800 --> 3:31:17.800]  of sacrifices a year per sitting.
[3:31:17.800 --> 3:31:19.800]  That's the same thing.
[3:31:19.800 --> 3:31:21.800]  As Satanism collapses, which it is now
[3:31:21.800 --> 3:31:23.800]  it's going to up the raping,
[3:31:23.800 --> 3:31:25.800]  up the sacrifice, up the murder
[3:31:25.800 --> 3:31:27.800]  believing that will sustain it.
[3:31:27.800 --> 3:31:29.800]  So that's why we're seeing a ramping up
[3:31:29.800 --> 3:31:31.800]  of the killing of children.
[3:31:31.800 --> 3:31:33.800]  You're 100% right about that Alex
[3:31:33.800 --> 3:31:35.800]  and that's not the fault of the truth movement
[3:31:35.800 --> 3:31:37.800]  that's the fault of these demons
[3:31:37.800 --> 3:31:39.800]  and we have to get these demons
[3:31:39.800 --> 3:31:41.800]  out of office and we have to get these demons
[3:31:41.800 --> 3:31:43.800]  out of power in order to save the children.
[3:31:43.800 --> 3:31:45.800]  Are there any estimates, because I don't know
[3:31:45.800 --> 3:31:47.800]  most of them just want to rape and abuse and dumb down
[3:31:47.800 --> 3:31:59.800]  that's how they suck energy, but with Alex
[3:31:59.800 --> 3:32:01.800]  we have no idea.
[3:32:01.800 --> 3:32:03.800]  The vast majority
[3:32:03.800 --> 3:32:05.800]  we have an idea of how many
[3:32:05.800 --> 3:32:07.800]  there are that go missing
[3:32:07.800 --> 3:32:09.800]  and we have an idea of how many
[3:32:09.800 --> 3:32:11.800]  there are who go missing who are never seen again.
[3:32:11.800 --> 3:32:13.800]  The question is how many
[3:32:13.800 --> 3:32:15.800]  of them are murdered who are never put
[3:32:15.800 --> 3:32:17.800]  through the criminal justice system
[3:32:17.800 --> 3:32:19.800]  because the criminal justice system is so corrupt.
[3:32:19.800 --> 3:32:21.800]  I was on the phone with a top state official
[3:32:21.800 --> 3:32:23.800]  in California and he confirmed to me
[3:32:23.800 --> 3:32:25.800]  that they do not put out an amber alert
[3:32:25.800 --> 3:32:27.800]  if a foster care child goes missing.
[3:32:27.800 --> 3:32:29.800]  Meanwhile I'm talking to parents
[3:32:29.800 --> 3:32:31.800]  of foster care children who are saying
[3:32:31.800 --> 3:32:33.800]  a family member saw this kid
[3:32:33.800 --> 3:32:35.800]  in a totally different state
[3:32:35.800 --> 3:32:37.800]  in totally different clothes
[3:32:37.800 --> 3:32:39.800]  in a shopping mall being led around
[3:32:39.800 --> 3:32:41.800]  with other kids who they weren't related to
[3:32:41.800 --> 3:32:43.800]  and this kid was taken away
[3:32:43.800 --> 3:32:45.800]  in a totally different state and you know
[3:32:45.800 --> 3:32:47.800]  it's predictive analytics that they use too
[3:32:47.800 --> 3:32:49.800]  like in Minority Report Future Crime
[3:32:49.800 --> 3:32:51.800]  they say oh well black people are more
[3:32:51.800 --> 3:32:53.800]  susceptible to
[3:32:53.800 --> 3:32:55.800]  getting involved in crime
[3:32:55.800 --> 3:32:57.800]  and so therefore we need to take their kids away
[3:32:57.800 --> 3:32:59.800]  and it's a racist system and then they put
[3:32:59.800 --> 3:33:01.800]  the kids into the foster care system
[3:33:01.800 --> 3:33:03.800]  and they don't put out an amber alert.
[3:33:03.800 --> 3:33:05.800]  This is the biggest fan of the FBI
[3:33:05.800 --> 3:33:07.800]  confirmed last week. They're waving background checks
[3:33:07.800 --> 3:33:09.800]  for the people keeping all these kids
[3:33:09.800 --> 3:33:11.800]  that's totally illegal right there that's total proof.
[3:33:11.800 --> 3:33:13.800]  Absolutely
[3:33:13.800 --> 3:33:15.800]  absolutely right and Joe Biden
[3:33:15.800 --> 3:33:17.800]  said in the debate that he wants to send
[3:33:17.800 --> 3:33:19.800]  a social worker into everybody's homes
[3:33:19.800 --> 3:33:21.800]  Joe Biden's extremely damaged
[3:33:21.800 --> 3:33:23.800]  daughter is a social worker
[3:33:23.800 --> 3:33:25.800]  I mean these are the kinds of people who are going
[3:33:25.800 --> 3:33:27.800]  in there and making the determinations about kids
[3:33:27.800 --> 3:33:29.800]  but you know what I've done. Let's talk about how to stop them
[3:33:29.800 --> 3:33:31.800]  with Patrick Howley straight ahead
[3:33:31.800 --> 3:33:33.800]  and I've got a few other news items I'm going to get.
[3:33:33.800 --> 3:33:35.800]  My god folks this is a total disturbing takeover
[3:33:35.800 --> 3:33:37.800]  the cult has this wearing mask they have this lock down
[3:33:37.800 --> 3:33:39.800]  they're going to send contact tracers
[3:33:39.800 --> 3:33:41.800]  in our houses and it's already happening in Europe
[3:33:41.800 --> 3:33:59.800]  there it was. The answer to 1984 is 1776
[3:33:59.800 --> 3:34:03.800]  Infowars has been banned
[3:34:03.800 --> 3:34:07.800]  arrested
[3:34:07.800 --> 3:34:10.800]  attacked and threatened
[3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:13.800]  because we are effective
[3:34:13.800 --> 3:34:15.800]  the great awakening is here

[3:35:53.800 --> 3:35:55.800]  challenge first of all let me say
[3:35:55.800 --> 3:35:57.800]  I love your products I am a granny
[3:35:57.800 --> 3:36:00.800]  and for all the senior citizens out there
[3:36:00.800 --> 3:36:02.800]  that may have spent a lifetime in the sun
[3:36:02.800 --> 3:36:04.800]  like me I was loaded up with sunspots
[3:36:04.800 --> 3:36:07.800]  or age spots as they're lovingly called
[3:36:07.800 --> 3:36:10.800]  but since taking your X2 for the last couple of years
[3:36:10.800 --> 3:36:13.800]  my skin is just really gorgeous actually
[3:36:13.800 --> 3:36:15.800]  people think I'm 55 years old
[3:36:15.800 --> 3:36:18.800]  and I was already taking your other supplements
[3:36:18.800 --> 3:36:20.800]  but I thought you know well maybe that's
[3:36:20.800 --> 3:36:22.800]  what I need to do because I just thought
[3:36:22.800 --> 3:36:24.800]  it was a hopeless situation but when I
[3:36:24.800 --> 3:36:26.800]  started taking it and it doesn't happen
[3:36:26.800 --> 3:36:28.800]  immediately but you know over a period
[3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:31.800]  of time I started noticing okay you know
[3:36:31.800 --> 3:36:33.800]  this is the ticket this is working
[3:36:33.800 --> 3:36:35.800]  this is wonderful you know I don't
[3:36:35.800 --> 3:36:38.800]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore
[3:36:38.800 --> 3:36:41.800]  you know so anyway it worked wonderfully
[3:36:41.800 --> 3:36:43.800]  and it really has totally cleared up my
[3:36:43.800 --> 3:36:45.800]  skin
[3:36:45.800 --> 3:36:48.800]  Epic is one of only a handful of domain
[3:36:48.800 --> 3:36:51.800]  registrars that promote free speech
[3:36:51.800 --> 3:36:54.800]  and freedom of association and they know
[3:36:54.800 --> 3:36:56.800]  that big tech is buying up almost all
[3:36:56.800 --> 3:36:58.800]  the other major companies and engaging
[3:36:58.800 --> 3:37:00.800]  in massive censorship and organized crime
[3:37:00.800 --> 3:37:02.800]  racketeering that's why they've been
[3:37:02.800 --> 3:37:04.800]  massively expanding their services so
[3:37:04.800 --> 3:37:06.800]  whether you have domains or want to
[3:37:06.800 --> 3:37:08.800]  register a domain or want help building a
[3:37:08.800 --> 3:37:10.800]  website or want servers or any other
[3:37:10.800 --> 3:37:12.800]  major service they've got it all and
[3:37:12.800 --> 3:37:14.800]  they're expanding and if you go to
[3:37:14.800 --> 3:37:17.800]  infowarsdomains.com and follow that link
[3:37:17.800 --> 3:37:19.800]  you get all their services at the lowest
[3:37:19.800 --> 3:37:22.800]  price and 25 percent of your sign up
[3:37:22.800 --> 3:37:24.800]  for a new domain or a domain you move
[3:37:24.800 --> 3:37:26.800]  goes to fund the info war and then we
[3:37:26.800 --> 3:37:28.800]  get 5 percent as well for any servers
[3:37:28.800 --> 3:37:30.800]  or any other type of services that you
[3:37:30.800 --> 3:37:32.800]  get from them so it's a win-win as we
[3:37:32.800 --> 3:37:34.800]  build a true open free internet again
[3:37:34.800 --> 3:37:36.800]  because the globalists are destroying
[3:37:36.800 --> 3:37:38.800]  what was open and what was free so
[3:37:38.800 --> 3:37:40.800]  infowarsdomains.com
[3:37:40.800 --> 3:37:42.800]  the revolution starts there
[3:37:42.800 --> 3:37:44.800]  infowarsdomains.com
[3:37:44.800 --> 3:37:47.800]  take action now
[3:37:47.800 --> 3:37:50.800]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:37:59.800 --> 3:38:02.800]  alright final segment before the war
[3:38:02.800 --> 3:38:04.800]  it takes over the destroyer and boy he's got
[3:38:04.800 --> 3:38:06.800]  big general Flynn
[3:38:06.800 --> 3:38:08.800]  news that you do not want to mess it so vital
[3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:09.800]  to defeat these people but Patrick
[3:38:09.800 --> 3:38:11.800]  Cowley is a great Mexican journalist
[3:38:11.800 --> 3:38:12.800]  he's written for epic times written for
[3:38:12.800 --> 3:38:14.800]  all the big publications but he's off the
[3:38:14.800 --> 3:38:15.800]  leash
[3:38:15.800 --> 3:38:17.800]  and he's also on chain over at
[3:38:17.800 --> 3:38:19.800]  nationalfile.com
[3:38:19.800 --> 3:38:21.800]  I can ask a lot of questions here in
[3:38:21.800 --> 3:38:23.800]  closing with the few minutes we have left
[3:38:23.800 --> 3:38:25.800]  what else do you want to tell the audience
[3:38:25.800 --> 3:38:27.800]  about what else you want to get to my
[3:38:27.800 --> 3:38:29.800]  friend Alex I want to first of all thank
[3:38:29.800 --> 3:38:31.800]  you for this amazing platform I get
[3:38:31.800 --> 3:38:33.800]  recognized all over the country now when
[3:38:33.800 --> 3:38:35.800]  I travel around for telling the truth
[3:38:35.800 --> 3:38:37.800]  and and this is such an amazing
[3:38:37.800 --> 3:38:39.800]  opportunity to do so we are right now
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:41.800]  in a period where we can go one of two
[3:38:41.800 --> 3:38:43.800]  different directions we can either go
[3:38:43.800 --> 3:38:45.800]  in the direction of being asked by these
[3:38:45.800 --> 3:38:47.800]  demons forever we can go in the direction
[3:38:47.800 --> 3:38:49.800]  of having our society locked down and we
[3:38:49.800 --> 3:38:51.800]  can go in the direction of surrendering
[3:38:51.800 --> 3:38:53.800]  forever and thinking that well Lucifer
[3:38:53.800 --> 3:38:55.800]  rules the world down there's nothing we
[3:38:55.800 --> 3:38:57.800]  can do about it or we can realize that
[3:38:57.800 --> 3:38:59.800]  these people are idiots these people are
[3:38:59.800 --> 3:39:01.800]  not very bright these people are
[3:39:01.800 --> 3:39:03.800]  incompetent these people are human
[3:39:03.800 --> 3:39:05.800]  traffickers who are doing horrible things
[3:39:05.800 --> 3:39:07.800]  to kids this is relatively recent in terms
[3:39:07.800 --> 3:39:09.800]  of the amount of power that they've had
[3:39:09.800 --> 3:39:11.800]  they have not had total power in the
[3:39:11.800 --> 3:39:13.800]  United States we are going to fix our
[3:39:13.800 --> 3:39:15.800]  election systems I guarantee you like
[3:39:15.800 --> 3:39:17.800]  in Georgia like in Arizona we are
[3:39:17.800 --> 3:39:19.800]  going to fix our election system we
[3:39:19.800 --> 3:39:21.800]  are taking that's right that's the big
[3:39:21.800 --> 3:39:23.800]  no no we're not supposed to talk about
[3:39:23.800 --> 3:39:25.800]  this again the attention now massive
[3:39:25.800 --> 3:39:27.800]  fraud the Texas AG said total fraud
[3:39:27.800 --> 3:39:29.800]  was found Arizona everywhere the
[3:39:29.800 --> 3:39:31.800]  frauds coming out we're passing laws to
[3:39:31.800 --> 3:39:33.800]  block it they are crapping their bridges
[3:39:33.800 --> 3:39:35.800]  absolutely right and we are going to
[3:39:35.800 --> 3:39:37.800]  get these candidates and every single
[3:39:37.800 --> 3:39:39.800]  district who are real citizens and I
[3:39:39.800 --> 3:39:41.800]  told one of the top people in the
[3:39:41.800 --> 3:39:43.800]  Republican Party and he is freaking out
[3:39:43.800 --> 3:39:45.800]  after I told them this I told them you know
[3:39:45.800 --> 3:39:47.800]  what we're going to do we're going to do
[3:39:47.800 --> 3:39:49.800]  a moneyball situation we're going to get
[3:39:49.800 --> 3:39:51.800]  guys who are very
[3:39:51.800 --> 3:39:53.800]  inexpensive compared to normal Republican
[3:39:53.800 --> 3:39:55.800]  candidates we are going to get guys
[3:39:55.800 --> 3:39:57.800]  who know their district and women who
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:39:59.800]  know their district okay they get on base
[3:39:59.800 --> 3:40:01.800]  with a high on base percentage they're
[3:40:01.800 --> 3:40:03.800]  going to win primaries all over the place
[3:40:03.800 --> 3:40:05.800]  they're going to win general elections
[3:40:05.800 --> 3:40:07.800]  we're going to form an America first
[3:40:07.800 --> 3:40:09.800]  that is going to be a genuine roadblock
[3:40:09.800 --> 3:40:11.800]  and that's what they really fear but beyond
[3:40:11.800 --> 3:40:13.800]  that that's important we have the power
[3:40:13.800 --> 3:40:15.800]  to destroy these these these neocons
[3:40:15.800 --> 3:40:17.800]  and fake republics of what you're doing
[3:40:17.800 --> 3:40:19.800]  that's just as important as oh you're
[3:40:19.800 --> 3:40:21.800]  you're going to try to steal a lecture from us
[3:40:21.800 --> 3:40:23.800]  how about we destroy you
[3:40:23.800 --> 3:40:25.800]  and you think it can't be done
[3:40:25.800 --> 3:40:27.800]  John Merrill was the frontrunner for U.S. Senate
[3:40:27.800 --> 3:40:29.800]  as of yesterday I wrote one article
[3:40:29.800 --> 3:40:31.800]  and now he's basically out of the race
[3:40:31.800 --> 3:40:33.800]  President Trump has endorsed Mo Brooks
[3:40:33.800 --> 3:40:35.800]  today and I doubt that John Merrill is going to get
[3:40:35.800 --> 3:40:37.800]  this this way we're going to do this
[3:40:37.800 --> 3:40:39.800]  district by district I know everything
[3:40:39.800 --> 3:40:41.800]  that's why these people are sucking up to me
[3:40:41.800 --> 3:40:43.800]  every single day I'm going to expose
[3:40:43.800 --> 3:40:45.800]  at least one new politician or media figure
[3:40:45.800 --> 3:40:47.800]  okay and we are going to
[3:40:47.800 --> 3:40:49.800]  I'm going to get back to Gates because I respect your view
[3:40:49.800 --> 3:40:51.800]  give me your real view on Matt Gates
[3:40:51.800 --> 3:40:53.800]  Matt Gates is going to be okay
[3:40:53.800 --> 3:40:55.800]  now the question comes down to
[3:40:55.800 --> 3:40:57.800]  was there anything with a 17 year old
[3:40:57.800 --> 3:40:59.800]  so far there's no evidence there's no evidence
[3:40:59.800 --> 3:41:01.800]  okay and so you
[3:41:01.800 --> 3:41:03.800]  have people who are totally discredited
[3:41:03.800 --> 3:41:05.800]  people who have made claims with
[3:41:05.800 --> 3:41:07.800]  no liars yeah
[3:41:07.800 --> 3:41:09.800]  and you have a situation
[3:41:09.800 --> 3:41:11.800]  where we know from Roger Stone that the
[3:41:11.800 --> 3:41:13.800]  deep state is targeting people
[3:41:13.800 --> 3:41:15.800]  trying to take out America first people
[3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:17.800]  and we have a lot of people who are supporting Matt Gates
[3:41:17.800 --> 3:41:19.800]  and so you know my feeling is that
[3:41:19.800 --> 3:41:21.800]  Matt Gates is going to be just fine and
[3:41:21.800 --> 3:41:23.800]  you know until there's any evidence
[3:41:23.800 --> 3:41:25.800]  there's no reason to condemn somebody and
[3:41:25.800 --> 3:41:27.800]  President Donald Trump has said that himself
[3:41:27.800 --> 3:41:29.800]  oh listen I've seen the stories and I killed
[3:41:29.800 --> 3:41:31.800]  the boy's goldfish never had goldfish
[3:41:31.800 --> 3:41:33.800]  in this building I believe me
[3:41:33.800 --> 3:41:35.800]  but the media is like oh they won't listen to
[3:41:35.800 --> 3:41:37.800]  trafficking look how they call it
[3:41:37.800 --> 3:41:39.800]  trafficking a 17 year old girlfriend
[3:41:39.800 --> 3:41:41.800]  even if it's true all of it's like
[3:41:41.800 --> 3:41:43.800]  phrased because we're on them for human
[3:41:43.800 --> 3:41:45.800]  trafficking in mass scale
[3:41:45.800 --> 3:41:47.800]  Biden legalizing it illegally
[3:41:47.800 --> 3:41:49.800]  and then they want to say Matt Gates is a
[3:41:49.800 --> 3:41:51.800]  trafficker it's obviously a cheap trick
[3:41:51.800 --> 3:41:53.800]  that's right it's a diversion
[3:41:53.800 --> 3:41:55.800]  and so many of these people now
[3:41:55.800 --> 3:41:57.800]  who are in the leftist cult they're even
[3:41:57.800 --> 3:41:59.800]  waking up to this and they're saying wait a second
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:01.800]  there's so many kids being trafficked over
[3:42:01.800 --> 3:42:03.800]  the border wait a second what is really
[3:42:03.800 --> 3:42:05.800]  going on here with the demonic energy
[3:42:05.800 --> 3:42:07.800]  that these people believe in and you know
[3:42:07.800 --> 3:42:09.800]  being a liberal never was supposed
[3:42:09.800 --> 3:42:11.800]  to mean being part of some kind of
[3:42:11.800 --> 3:42:13.800]  satanic cult but that's what it is now
[3:42:13.800 --> 3:42:15.800]  and so you're going to see a lot of people
[3:42:15.800 --> 3:42:17.800]  moving away from it this Biden
[3:42:17.800 --> 3:42:19.800]  Biden might very well be the last Democrat
[3:42:19.800 --> 3:42:21.800]  president and I truly mean that very optimistic
[3:42:21.800 --> 3:42:23.800]  that the truth is getting out there
[3:42:23.800 --> 3:42:25.800]  let me ask you this in closing
[3:42:25.800 --> 3:42:27.800]  how long does Biden last
[3:42:27.800 --> 3:42:29.800]  because we knew that they wanted a puppet
[3:42:29.800 --> 3:42:31.800]  but my god they want a puppet that functions
[3:42:31.800 --> 3:42:33.800]  this puppet's not working
[3:42:33.800 --> 3:42:35.800]  got level you're a smart guy or what's the inside
[3:42:35.800 --> 3:42:37.800]  baseball he talked to a lot of big people
[3:42:37.800 --> 3:42:39.800]  what's the good thinking on him
[3:42:41.800 --> 3:42:43.800]  nobody seems to really know because right now
[3:42:43.800 --> 3:42:45.800]  the deep state has a blank check
[3:42:45.800 --> 3:42:47.800]  and basically you know Biden allows them
[3:42:47.800 --> 3:42:49.800]  to be able to go to war with Russia
[3:42:49.800 --> 3:42:51.800]  to accelerate tensions in Syria
[3:42:51.800 --> 3:42:53.800]  exactly he's going to get the blame
[3:42:53.800 --> 3:42:55.800]  so he might just disappear from us
[3:42:55.800 --> 3:42:57.800]  they'll still say he's the president
[3:42:57.800 --> 3:42:59.800]  yeah that's exactly right
[3:42:59.800 --> 3:43:01.800]  so I've always thought that they're going to keep him
[3:43:01.800 --> 3:43:03.800]  going as long as possible
[3:43:03.800 --> 3:43:05.800]  the thing you have to remember too is
[3:43:05.800 --> 3:43:07.800]  Kamala Harris doesn't have power either
[3:43:07.800 --> 3:43:09.800]  she wasn't even briefed on the Syria strike
[3:43:09.800 --> 3:43:11.800]  they won't even let her move into the observatory
[3:43:11.800 --> 3:43:13.800]  yeah people who are
[3:43:13.800 --> 3:43:15.800]  running at her deep state it's Janet Yellen
[3:43:15.800 --> 3:43:17.800]  and Susan Rice it's the people who are in the cabinet
[3:43:17.800 --> 3:43:19.800]  okay and it's
[3:43:19.800 --> 3:43:21.800]  Goldman Sachs and it's the financial sector
[3:43:21.800 --> 3:43:23.800]  and it's Boeing and it's Raytheon
[3:43:23.800 --> 3:43:25.800]  also of deep state people
[3:43:25.800 --> 3:43:27.800]  and they are
[3:43:27.800 --> 3:43:29.800]  in total power right now they have a puppet president
[3:43:29.800 --> 3:43:31.800]  everybody knows they have a puppet president
[3:43:31.800 --> 3:43:33.800]  but you've got the influence of the Chai comms
[3:43:33.800 --> 3:43:35.800]  what they want is a war with Russia
[3:43:35.800 --> 3:43:37.800]  they really want a war with Russia
[3:43:37.800 --> 3:43:39.800]  so it all comes down to do they think having
[3:43:39.800 --> 3:43:41.800]  puppet Biden is going to get them the war with Russia
[3:43:41.800 --> 3:43:43.800]  or bring in somebody else
[3:43:43.800 --> 3:43:45.800]  but if you know they bring in somebody else
[3:43:45.800 --> 3:43:47.800]  that person might have their own ideas
[3:43:47.800 --> 3:43:49.800]  and they don't want that
[3:43:49.800 --> 3:43:51.800]  incredible alright we'll keep watching
[3:43:51.800 --> 3:43:53.800]  thank you Alex Jones
[3:43:53.800 --> 3:43:55.800]  alright we're going to talk to Owen Troyer
[3:43:55.800 --> 3:43:57.800]  ahead of his show he's got some big breaking news
[3:43:57.800 --> 3:43:59.800]  in a moment but first have you heard of it
[3:43:59.800 --> 3:44:01.800]  it's the world
[3:44:01.800 --> 3:44:03.800]  economic forum smart muzzle

[3:44:07.800 --> 3:44:09.800]  it's the smart muzzle
[3:44:09.800 --> 3:44:11.800]  and when you're not wearing the smart muzzle it's better than

[3:44:35.800 --> 3:44:37.800]  it tracks everything you do on your smart phone

[3:44:41.800 --> 3:44:43.800]  and alien first we're watching TV
[3:44:43.800 --> 3:44:45.800]  then we're looking at a phone

[3:47:05.800 --> 3:47:07.800]  with the spars epidemic plan for COVID
[3:47:07.800 --> 3:47:09.800]  boiling it down to about 30 minutes
[3:47:09.800 --> 3:47:11.800]  we're going to squeeze it into three segments

[3:47:17.800 --> 3:47:19.800]  that's not even the one being produced
[3:47:19.800 --> 3:47:21.800]  and promoted by the
[3:47:21.800 --> 3:47:23.800]  rapper Will I Am
[3:47:23.800 --> 3:47:25.800]  who actually made the song let's get retarded

[3:47:27.800 --> 3:47:29.800]  they get offended when you say that now
[3:47:29.800 --> 3:47:31.800]  but that's like low grade
[3:47:31.800 --> 3:47:33.800]  what he's promoting it's got earbuds for you Alex

[3:47:55.800 --> 3:47:57.800]  vaccine deaths but
[3:47:57.800 --> 3:47:59.800]  this time it appears to be
[3:47:59.800 --> 3:48:01.800]  to be somebody who was working for CNN
[3:48:01.800 --> 3:48:03.800]  and MSNBC
[3:48:03.800 --> 3:48:05.800]  so we'll see if they want to cover that
[3:48:05.800 --> 3:48:07.800]  and we also have board of patrol as you
[3:48:07.800 --> 3:48:09.800]  covered today as well saying look there could

[3:48:13.800 --> 3:48:15.800]  all and guess how many people tuned
