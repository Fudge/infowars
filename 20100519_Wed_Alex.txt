[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.760]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.760 --> 00:29.840]  I have a message a message from the Tea Party a message that is loud and clear
[00:29.840 --> 00:44.400]  and does not mince words we've come to take our government back we've come to
[00:44.400 --> 00:48.320]  take our government back from the special interest who think that the
[00:48.320 --> 00:54.520]  federal government is their own personal ATM from the politicians who bring us
[00:54.520 --> 01:01.360]  oversized fake checks emblazoned with their signature as if it was their money
[01:01.360 --> 01:09.440]  to give Washington is horribly broken I think we stand on a precipice we are
[01:09.440 --> 01:15.680]  encountering a day of reckoning and this movement this Tea Party movement is a
[01:15.680 --> 01:20.520]  message to Washington that we're unhappy and that we want things done
[01:20.520 --> 01:36.320]  differently the Tea Party movement is huge the mandate of our victory tonight
[01:36.320 --> 01:45.200]  is huge what you have done and what we are doing can transform America I think
[01:45.200 --> 01:53.000]  I think America's greatness hinges on us doing something to save the country the
[01:53.000 --> 01:59.080]  Tea Party movement is about saving the country from a mountain of debt that is
[01:59.080 --> 02:06.200]  devouring our country and I think could lead to chaos we now have a president
[02:06.200 --> 02:12.280]  though who apologizes for America's greatness we have a president who went
[02:12.280 --> 02:19.280]  to Copenhagen and appeared with Robert Mugabe Hugo Chavez and others
[02:19.280 --> 02:26.240]  Evo Morales to apologize for the industrial revolution they say these
[02:26.240 --> 02:32.560]  dictators these petty dictators say that to stop climate change it's about
[02:32.560 --> 02:39.120]  ending capitalism they are explicit and the president by attending Copenhagen
[02:39.120 --> 02:48.840]  gives credibility and credence to these folks and he should not go and CNN cuts
[02:48.840 --> 02:56.960]  in America's a great year and you were listening right there to Rand Paul who
[02:56.960 --> 03:02.680]  is of course or one down in Kentucky the Republican statement from Mitch
[03:02.680 --> 03:06.360]  McConnell they panicked big time as soon as he started taking on the new world
[03:06.360 --> 03:12.080]  order and we have the rest of the speech we'll play it later in the broadcast
[03:12.080 --> 03:21.360]  what CNN censored the fellow that beat specter oh they played all of his speech
[03:21.360 --> 03:27.320]  but not Rand Paul they are scared ladies and gentlemen they are scared big
[03:27.320 --> 03:31.360]  time in the media saying voters send a mixed message there you know they're
[03:31.360 --> 03:35.840]  kicking specter out in there and but they're going for Rand Paul you know they
[03:35.840 --> 03:40.880]  elected a Democrat over another Democrat or voted for him in the primary with
[03:40.880 --> 03:45.560]  specter but then they voted for a Republican against an establishment
[03:45.560 --> 03:51.360]  Republican G we don't know what this means we know exactly what this means
[03:51.360 --> 04:00.200]  anti-incumbent anti-establishment anti-new world order Rand Paul tops Ron
[04:00.200 --> 04:04.720]  Paul in Kentucky by a lot and it's an article showing how many votes that
[04:04.720 --> 04:10.920]  Ron Paul got a few years ago versus his son now very very exciting Rand Paul won
[04:10.920 --> 04:17.840]  against the establishment Republican by more than 30% and every number I've
[04:17.840 --> 04:22.560]  looked at every analysis of the state of Kentucky I've seen shows Rand Paul
[04:22.560 --> 04:30.440]  annihilating his Democratic challenger if the election is fair and when he had a
[04:30.440 --> 04:37.720]  whopping 18-point lead it was hard for him to steal the election ended up
[04:37.720 --> 04:47.160]  winning by 30 plus points what 33 points a 33 point mega win and the same thing

[08:19.800 --> 08:26.560]  in economic terrorism against the state of Arizona meddling in their affairs of
[08:26.560 --> 08:33.960]  Arizonans violating states rights we see all sorts of harassment now they're
[08:33.960 --> 08:37.960]  talking about not buying power other states not buying power that's a
[08:37.960 --> 08:43.280]  generated inside the state of Arizona that's because the globalist must bust

[08:48.320 --> 08:53.160]  American Union coming up in T minus an hour and fifty two minutes William
[08:53.160 --> 08:58.520]  Gean of alley pack will be joining us to cover all the latest developments on
[08:58.520 --> 09:05.600]  this front and the film machete we have confirmed that the Texas film commission
[09:05.600 --> 09:11.360]  that funded this film told us the truth last Thursday when we called them and
[09:11.360 --> 09:17.520]  they said yes we're funding machete with tax incentives location incentives and
[09:17.520 --> 09:24.640]  more then I was called and emailed on Thursday evening and Friday Rob do was
[09:24.640 --> 09:28.640]  specifically because he was the contact if he first called the film commission
[09:28.640 --> 09:32.720]  when I was writing this article with Aaron Dixon him that then made national
[09:32.720 --> 09:36.880]  news and the Washington Post drudge report in other places and the press
[09:36.880 --> 09:43.800]  secretary for the governor Rick Perry told us that no we're not funding it
[09:43.800 --> 09:47.440]  that hasn't been decided yet well we went and looked at the facts they decide
[09:47.440 --> 09:51.800]  whether to fund a film in the early stages just like a few years ago they
[09:51.800 --> 09:57.000]  refused to fund the Waco movie so they shot it in Louisiana instead and it's
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.440]  coming out in a few months and then we pulled up mainstream news articles from
[10:02.440 --> 10:07.400]  a year ago out of the San Antonio Express news and other publications with
[10:07.400 --> 10:13.840]  the head of the Texas film commission saying that they were indeed funding
[10:13.840 --> 10:22.360]  machete so just more lies from Rick Perry just continued deception from
[10:22.360 --> 10:27.600]  government over and over and over again government just thinks it's okay at all
[10:27.600 --> 10:32.280]  levels to just lie to people and you know I wasn't calling for the funding to be
[10:32.280 --> 10:35.920]  cut I just simply pointed out the taxpayers that you're helping pay for
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.880]  this what do you think of that okay and it's my first amendment to respond in
[10:41.880 --> 10:46.920]  the counter a film that seeks to create racial division in this nation if a movie
[10:46.920 --> 10:52.240]  was made where Hispanics were the bad guys and and the white savior is a
[10:52.240 --> 10:57.960]  Jesus art type who murders the evil Hispanics this country would be up in
[10:57.960 --> 11:02.280]  arms and it should be somebody can make that movie if they want but people would
[11:02.280 --> 11:07.200]  be up in arms and they should be well it's the same way with it being Hispanics
[11:07.200 --> 11:11.200]  being angels and white people all being a bunch of racist devils this is New
[11:11.200 --> 11:14.560]  World Order divide in Congress so we'll talk about that coming up in about two
[11:14.560 --> 11:20.200]  hours with William game of Ali pack always informative of course he outed
[11:20.200 --> 11:26.000]  the big Republican Senator Lindsey Graham for basically being blackmailed over
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.120]  his homosexuality and within days of that video going viral and making it in
[11:31.120 --> 11:35.320]  the news suddenly he they couldn't blackmail him anymore and Graham said
[11:35.320 --> 11:40.480]  I'm not for the global warming taxes I'm not for the open borders I'm not for
[11:40.480 --> 11:46.040]  any of this any more because they don't have anything to hold over his head and
[11:46.040 --> 11:51.760]  and that's the issue I mean if if Lindsey Graham is is gay and which is
[11:51.760 --> 11:57.360]  being reported by a lot of sources that are credible that's his own issue I'm
[11:57.360 --> 12:01.720]  not judging him for that but when he wants to put a tax on a little bit of
[12:01.720 --> 12:05.640]  industry we've got left when China and India and others won't have that tax on
[12:05.640 --> 12:09.280]  them and we'll give them an unfair trade advantage as if they don't already have
[12:09.280 --> 12:13.120]  an unfair one and when he wants to get rid of my borders and my sovereignty and
[12:13.120 --> 12:18.720]  says America is more of an idea than a place and when he votes for the
[12:18.720 --> 12:23.800]  government takeover of health care he's my enemy and when he's being blackmailed
[12:23.800 --> 12:31.560]  with that information he needs to be removed from office period punish these
[12:31.560 --> 12:37.000]  incumbents kick them out Republicans Democrats I don't care if you've been
[12:37.000 --> 12:40.720]  financed by the big banks if you're for the bank or bailout like Glenn Beck was
[12:40.720 --> 12:45.880]  by the way if you support any new world order operations if you try to attack
[12:45.880 --> 12:50.280]  states rights if you violate the Bill of Rights and Constitution I want you out
[12:50.280 --> 12:54.080]  of the Senate and the house we need to kick these people out of the state
[12:54.080 --> 12:58.360]  houses out of the city councils out of the townships out of the county
[12:58.360 --> 13:04.080]  commissionerships now kick the criminals the thugs the slime balls the
[13:04.080 --> 13:14.480]  parasites out we are on the March the Empire is on the run now record primary
[13:14.480 --> 13:22.880]  win record number 30 plus percent margin of victory over the neocon supported by
[13:22.880 --> 13:31.000]  Dick Cheney and from and crystal and all of these people a globalist funded by
[13:31.000 --> 13:37.960]  Goldman Sachs funded by AIG running his own election system wouldn't recuse
[13:37.960 --> 13:43.360]  himself but because the polls both Ron Paul and Rand Paul went to the hearings
[13:43.360 --> 13:47.400]  spoke out against it exposed the fact that this was a serious conflict of
[13:47.400 --> 13:51.800]  interest they were not able to engage in the vote rigging because if you're
[13:51.800 --> 13:55.680]  watching for vote rigging and you're aware of it and you've got a big margin
[13:55.680 --> 14:00.040]  of victory in every major poll some of them showed a 22% margin and I told you
[14:00.040 --> 14:07.600]  those were skewed when the rubber met the road 30 plus percent mega victory 30
[14:07.600 --> 14:14.920]  plus points was it 32 or 33 now the magic bullet staffer on the Warren
[14:14.920 --> 14:19.080]  Commission he was a staffer then I guess one of the little one of the little
[14:19.080 --> 14:26.240]  play things for the for the Congress people himself Arland Specter shouted
[14:26.240 --> 14:30.440]  down at all the town halls a year ago the media said they were hired by
[14:30.440 --> 14:34.680]  consultants no they weren't the public is angry over 80% now in polls against it
[14:34.680 --> 14:37.600]  the more they learn about the health care the more angry they get he is gone
[14:37.600 --> 14:48.320]  and here is CNN spin specters loss Paul's victory shake up murky political map
[14:48.320 --> 14:53.200]  and then they go on in the first line of the article voters sent mixed signals
[14:53.200 --> 14:59.400]  in Tuesday's primary election in Pennsylvania Kentucky in Arkansas they
[14:59.400 --> 15:03.800]  tossed out a veteran senator nominated a tea party back candidate it also chose
[15:03.800 --> 15:09.400]  a longtime aide to fill the US House seat vacant by the death of Democrat
[15:09.400 --> 15:17.200]  representative John Murtha no those aren't mixed signals everybody feels
[15:17.200 --> 15:24.320]  sorry for Murtha so and he's had a very strong Democrat liberal area so the
[15:24.320 --> 15:29.960]  aide gets in and then you've got Rand Paul trouncing the establishment
[15:29.960 --> 15:34.040]  Republican and then you've got the establishment Democrat flipped from
[15:34.040 --> 15:41.760]  Republican Arland Specter thrown out for the liberal but see the people just
[15:41.760 --> 15:46.120]  want someone that will actually do what they say they're going to do they want
[15:46.120 --> 15:49.880]  someone who is seen as anti establishment and that was only in the
[15:49.880 --> 15:54.880]  primary now we'll see if this Democrat wins in Pennsylvania against the
[15:54.880 --> 16:01.800]  Republican whoever is seen as anti establishment is going to win that's
[16:01.800 --> 16:05.760]  why Rick Perry is running around talking about secession and putting out
[16:05.760 --> 16:10.520]  stories about how he's in the the Hill Country of Austin jogging in Westlake
[16:10.520 --> 16:16.000]  Hills killing coyotes and how he carries guns and how he's you know anti new
[16:16.000 --> 16:19.680]  world order when he's a Bilderberg group attendee that's the only reason Perry
[16:19.680 --> 16:27.640]  won is because he posed as one of us and here's another big problem I told you
[16:27.640 --> 16:31.000]  this a year and a half ago because he's the top insider in the Republican Party
[16:31.000 --> 16:35.920]  right now when it comes to taking over political operations the Republicans
[16:35.920 --> 16:41.720]  in 1994 swept in they were going to cut taxes they were gonna reverse gun grabbing
[16:41.720 --> 16:46.800]  legislation they were going to you know really turn this country around so the
[16:46.800 --> 16:51.320]  Clinton boys bombed Oklahoma City a to demonize states rights in the patriot
[16:51.320 --> 16:57.240]  movement but B they sent in Gennrich to sabotage the Republicans well he's
[16:57.240 --> 17:00.760]  telling Politico and others as I covered yesterday that he is going to run for
[17:00.760 --> 17:05.640]  president in the next two years into 2012 that he's gonna get all the
[17:05.640 --> 17:10.000]  establishment backing and that he's gonna try to lead this this this
[17:10.000 --> 17:16.920]  Republican takeover of the House and Senate that he says is an 80% chance and
[17:16.920 --> 17:25.040]  I agree with him it's more than 80% the problem is we need to get Rand Paul type
[17:25.040 --> 17:29.840]  Republicans in who were anti-war anti-patriot act pro-bill of rights
[17:29.840 --> 17:36.320]  constitution anti-global warming taxes pro-second amendment who will
[17:36.320 --> 17:41.280]  basically alert us to what's happening in the Senate blow the whistle on what's
[17:41.280 --> 17:45.800]  going on up there use that power as a US senator as a bully pulpit to educate
[17:45.800 --> 17:53.360]  everyone and to then show the population that true constitutionalist can win for
[17:53.360 --> 17:58.000]  even big races like governor not just state legislature but governor and US
[17:58.000 --> 18:03.280]  senator and House member and this is the beginning of the collapse of the new
[18:03.280 --> 18:08.720]  world order they are not invincible it is not written in stone that they must
[18:08.720 --> 18:17.080]  win we can be given a reprieve like Nineveh we can be given a reprieve just
[18:17.080 --> 18:23.200]  like with Jonah we can be given a hundred year reprieve it is a mind game a
[18:23.200 --> 18:28.560]  globalist mind control operation to say that it's the end of the world and we're
[18:28.560 --> 18:33.560]  about to all be raptured and that as Americans we have to just sit here and
[18:33.560 --> 18:38.280]  suck our thumbs and this supposedly a predominantly Protestant nation was
[18:38.280 --> 18:42.200]  founded by proud Protestants but all religions are welcome you know under the
[18:42.200 --> 18:47.320]  First Amendment and you wonder why there isn't going to be one Protestant on the
[18:47.320 --> 18:51.400]  court well that's because Protestants for 150 years have been waiting for the
[18:51.400 --> 18:57.040]  rapture suck on their thumbs and it's and it's this overall globalist funded

[25:55.600 --> 26:00.280]  Treaty they're panicking they're openly saying we don't have much time to set up
[26:00.280 --> 26:06.920]  our world government we have a new video coming up in the next segment it's up
[26:06.920 --> 26:11.560]  on info wars.com and prison planet.com Paul Watson's doing a detailed article
[26:11.560 --> 26:17.120]  that's going to be up in the next hour or so at prisonplanet.com on this
[26:17.120 --> 26:26.400]  important subject how many globalist UN heads EU heads Gordon Brown before he
[26:26.400 --> 26:29.640]  was thrown out of office are openly calling for world government right now
[26:29.640 --> 26:37.400]  how many a lot are calling for it how many clips have we played and see this
[26:37.400 --> 26:43.520]  new video clip we have of Zbigniew Brzezinski one of Obama's chief advisers
[26:43.520 --> 26:48.520]  in this video he says we've got a problem as he's addressing the Council on
[26:48.520 --> 26:53.600]  Foreign Relations he says we've got a problem our global government is not
[26:53.600 --> 27:01.560]  completed yet he says the G20 is our best vehicle right now for world
[27:01.560 --> 27:06.840]  government not the United Nations and he said the problem we have is for the
[27:06.840 --> 27:12.680]  first time in human history and this is true for the first time in human history
[27:12.680 --> 27:20.400]  the entire world is awake to the true nature of the political system that's
[27:20.400 --> 27:24.280]  why for 50 years they've denied they were building a world government using
[27:24.280 --> 27:29.720]  the blood sweat and tears and energy of the United States and Europe and he
[27:29.720 --> 27:33.000]  admits that he says it's been a global government based in and around the
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.040]  Atlantic system that means Europe Western Europe England the United States
[27:37.040 --> 27:44.080]  Canada Australia is an auxiliary in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and he lays
[27:44.080 --> 27:48.080]  it all out and then says global government we don't have the global
[27:48.080 --> 27:53.640]  government yet and everybody has woken up to us that's what he says in this
[27:53.640 --> 27:59.720]  video and audio that's coming up the next segment and then he talks about he
[27:59.720 --> 28:04.600]  does it all in in bureaucrat speak he's a great speaker very intelligent very
[28:04.600 --> 28:10.120]  wicked he's one of the chief planners of our world he's probably more of a master
[28:10.120 --> 28:16.280]  planner than even Henry Kissinger he is a master planner and he breaks down the
[28:16.280 --> 28:21.640]  true power structure of the world and says for the first time this is such a
[28:21.640 --> 28:26.720]  big deal this is what we've been telling you for the first time the planet is
[28:26.720 --> 28:32.920]  awake to the true political structure of the globe that's why they'd always
[28:32.920 --> 28:38.080]  deny it was a children's game we can never have a real debate about this they
[28:38.080 --> 28:41.160]  would just say on the news anybody that says there's a global banking cartel and
[28:41.160 --> 28:43.840]  a world government being set up as a racist cook who wants to murder your
[28:43.840 --> 28:49.040]  children basically and who wears swastika underwear had nothing to do with
[28:49.040 --> 28:52.960]  that and the media would only have attention to white supremacist groups
[28:52.960 --> 28:57.400]  and others who were covering this information on HBO specials and CNN
[28:57.400 --> 29:03.320]  specials to falsely paint the picture that anyone that talks about freedom and
[29:03.320 --> 29:07.320]  liberty must be an extremist so that the general public would get scared away
[29:07.320 --> 29:12.440]  from it so they could stall a real debate until it was too late but you
[29:12.440 --> 29:15.560]  know what tens of millions of people globally didn't care what labels we
[29:15.560 --> 29:18.640]  were given didn't care how we were demonized didn't care how we were set
[29:18.640 --> 29:23.840]  up didn't care how we were provocateur didn't care we were going to expose
[29:23.840 --> 29:28.160]  these people knowing that as their system came out in the open that would
[29:28.160 --> 29:34.200]  then bring them down and that has now happened and so he basically is up
[29:34.200 --> 29:39.320]  there like in the movie they live telling the inner council they can see
[29:39.320 --> 29:43.560]  more and more people are putting on the sunglasses so they can see the real

[33:07.040 --> 33:13.440]  CFR meetings at Bignan Brzezinski fears the global awakening is the headline the
[33:13.440 --> 33:18.160]  videos up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com Paul Watson's got a story
[33:18.160 --> 33:22.800]  he's writing that'll be out in the next 30 minutes to an hour very important to
[33:22.800 --> 33:28.840]  get this out to everyone this is one of the top globalist tacticians he is at
[33:28.840 --> 33:33.000]  the highest levels of the global government system they control the
[33:33.000 --> 33:38.240]  world financial system they control the biggest military power on earth but they
[33:38.240 --> 33:44.400]  do not control our minds and for the first time there is a massive worldwide
[33:44.400 --> 33:50.800]  awakening now he starts slow and it's all couched in globalist lingo but then
[33:50.800 --> 33:55.680]  he he cuts to the chase with global government and basically explains it's
[33:55.680 --> 34:01.560]  a problem for them and he basically states you know that the US has the
[34:01.560 --> 34:06.120]  best weapons but we're checkmated by Russia and he goes on to say the UN is
[34:06.120 --> 34:10.560]  only a debating society that we can only push initiatives through when we have
[34:10.560 --> 34:16.000]  almost total agreement and he then discusses the UN Security Council and
[34:16.000 --> 34:22.240]  now it has the real power and then he says you know our global government is
[34:22.240 --> 34:28.240]  not complete and that they're basically losing ground every day and the danger
[34:28.240 --> 34:32.120]  is they're gonna launch a world war three type operation that's their number
[34:32.120 --> 34:35.200]  one ace in the hole against iran that's going to the front burner right now
[34:35.200 --> 34:39.600]  they are going to stage terror attacks worldwide to blame on domestic ribs that
[34:39.600 --> 34:44.840]  are anti globalist part of the worldwide revolt against the banking system
[34:44.840 --> 34:48.920]  against the private corporate government it's simple the new world order is a
[34:48.920 --> 34:57.240]  global corporate takeover of governments it is government by corrupt
[34:57.240 --> 35:05.440]  piratical corporations that's all it is and they also want to set up their
[35:05.440 --> 35:09.320]  world government because their ideology is that they want to carry out eugenics
[35:09.320 --> 35:13.120]  population reduction for the new world order global government is only the
[35:13.120 --> 35:17.640]  beginning as we cover my film in-game blueprint for global enslavement that is
[35:17.640 --> 35:22.960]  such important viewing it is essential viewing for everyone yes you the
[35:22.960 --> 35:26.480]  listener out there have seen it or read about it or have seen the documents but
[35:26.480 --> 35:31.160]  has your neighbor what is stopping you from warning your neighbors to putting
[35:31.160 --> 35:35.880]  it on access TV getting all the films out to everyone they are the most
[35:35.880 --> 35:40.400]  effective tool we've got how many times that do up the phones up and police are
[35:40.400 --> 35:44.040]  calling in where their entire department is awake now to the new world order
[35:44.040 --> 35:49.360]  because of our films obama deception fall the republic invisible empire how
[35:49.360 --> 35:53.120]  many times you hear military people calling her contractors in afghanistan in
[35:53.120 --> 35:57.840]  iraq and other bases in japan talking about one of my films being left in the
[35:57.840 --> 36:03.120]  recreation area or the coffee room or the mess hall and then they pick it up
[36:03.120 --> 36:07.400]  they watch it and they make copies and they wake up their unit we are
[36:07.400 --> 36:12.280]  unstoppable ladies and gentlemen all the fancy teleprompters all the three
[36:12.280 --> 36:17.480]  thousand dollar suits and five hundred dollar ties all of the fancy you know
[36:17.480 --> 36:21.040]  backgrounds and american flags the globalist like to give speeches in front
[36:21.040 --> 36:28.240]  of to give them the image of authority and gravitas and power it's a fraud they
[36:28.240 --> 36:32.200]  have to keep reapplying their lives reapplying their propaganda and they made
[36:32.200 --> 36:36.920]  a big miscalculation the last 20 years as the alternative media rose through
[36:36.920 --> 36:42.120]  films and newsletters and books and pamphlets before the internet really got
[36:42.120 --> 36:46.480]  big in the last decade and then that just supercharged it we were there laying
[36:46.480 --> 36:51.800]  out exactly what was going to happen because we had their public plans this
[36:51.800 --> 36:56.480]  stuff was public they were so arrogant they didn't hide ran corporation and
[36:56.480 --> 37:01.920]  council and foreign relations in un and club of rome programs they didn't hide
[37:01.920 --> 37:05.400]  congressional hearings about the world government and how they were going to
[37:05.400 --> 37:09.240]  set it up they thought you were so drunk on beer and entertainment and
[37:09.240 --> 37:16.560]  football that you weren't paying attention and so we had their exact
[37:16.560 --> 37:20.520]  blueprint we laid out exactly what they were gonna do how they would trigger the
[37:20.520 --> 37:23.880]  police state takeover with terror attacks they staged how they would bring in a
[37:23.880 --> 37:28.400]  global carbon tax to shut down industry by design with their quotes saying they
[37:28.400 --> 37:32.760]  were going to do it we would talk about it they would call us liars the public
[37:32.760 --> 37:36.600]  found out they were the liars and they've lost all credibility and now we're to
[37:36.600 --> 37:40.440]  the next phase telling the public okay you like what naftan get and
[37:40.440 --> 37:44.440]  globalization and are these trillions of dollars of taxes to give these bankers
[37:44.440 --> 37:48.000]  trillions of dollars to expand their global takeover do you like this do you
[37:48.000 --> 37:51.280]  think this is a good future do you like what's happened so far you better choose
[37:51.280 --> 37:56.360]  aside it isn't enough to be anti-new world order in your mind you've got to go
[37:56.360 --> 38:01.720]  out and wake others up you've got to take action you've got to put your
[38:01.720 --> 38:05.680]  awakening into action to awaken others and take action against the new world
[38:05.680 --> 38:09.680]  order and a lot of people never take action because they want to formulate a
[38:09.680 --> 38:14.080]  big plan or they want their presentation to be perfect or or they have endless
[38:14.080 --> 38:18.840]  planning meetings locally and they never agree on what they're gonna do just get
[38:18.840 --> 38:23.520]  it done okay let me tell you you just take the hill ladies and gentlemen you
[38:23.520 --> 38:27.160]  put one foot in front of the other and you commit that we're gonna take down
[38:27.160 --> 38:33.280]  the new world order that's it and as you take action you'll get better and
[38:33.280 --> 38:36.360]  better you'll become a better speaker you'll become more authoritative you'll
[38:36.360 --> 38:39.920]  learn more you'll become more dynamic why don't you start with a one-page
[38:39.920 --> 38:44.400]  flyer with whatever simple message you want about the new world order with
[38:44.400 --> 38:48.840]  websites on it and post those on telephone polls all over town you'll
[38:48.840 --> 38:52.840]  reach thousands of people right there why don't you start an access TV show
[38:52.840 --> 38:58.160]  why don't you call the talk radio every day not my show but controlled left
[38:58.160 --> 39:02.920]  controlled right new world order paradigm programs we are the majority
[39:02.920 --> 39:10.520]  show it start activating ever been walking through the woods in the spring
[39:10.520 --> 39:19.120]  or the fall when the glow worms are out mating and you just see the the forest
[39:19.120 --> 39:26.920]  path completely glowing blue each little worm by itself you can barely even see
[39:26.920 --> 39:32.920]  its gleam but you see thousands of worms on the path the path is glowing
[39:32.920 --> 39:36.600]  well we're a lot bigger and more important and more articulate than a
[39:36.600 --> 39:43.440]  glow worm you ever seen swarms of fireflies oh their lights are small but
[39:43.440 --> 39:47.960]  when there's hundreds of them it just lights up the night lights up the
[39:47.960 --> 39:53.520]  glade lights up the meadow and that little light in the darkness stands out
[39:53.520 --> 39:59.480]  so bright so bright that's how we're gonna beat these people using their
[39:59.480 --> 40:04.080]  communist slogan against them many hands make light work do not screw around
[40:04.080 --> 40:11.720]  engage engage engage engage engage engage engage engage you know when I pushed
[40:11.720 --> 40:15.400]  Ron Paul privately and I wasn't trying to brag he later came on air and said
[40:15.400 --> 40:18.120]  half our early support came from your show thanks for getting us off the
[40:18.120 --> 40:26.160]  launching pad same thing with Rand he's thanked us here on air and Ron Paul
[40:26.160 --> 40:29.080]  didn't want to run because he knew he'd probably lose then people would become
[40:29.080 --> 40:35.800]  disillusioned but I said on air as we pushed as we told people to call him
[40:35.800 --> 40:39.400]  and tell him to run I said he's gonna run and he's probably gonna lose but
[40:39.400 --> 40:44.520]  he's gonna be able to inject real conservatism into the debate he is going
[40:44.520 --> 40:51.000]  to help build our movement and so the $15 million or whatever it was that we
[40:51.000 --> 40:56.440]  the people gave him in record contributions record amount of
[40:56.440 --> 41:01.040]  contributions because not just a record amount biggest ever day six plus
[41:01.040 --> 41:05.320]  million in one day nobody's ever broken that but also it was that they were
[41:05.320 --> 41:10.600]  small donations what on average about 50 bucks it depended which money bomb it
[41:10.600 --> 41:15.360]  was but I saw numbers of $25 $51 the point is it was record donations and
[41:15.360 --> 41:21.400]  that also broke the record for them for them being small and that was an
[41:21.400 --> 41:25.480]  investment and then he lost and people came out and they had co until pro we've
[41:25.480 --> 41:30.160]  identified you know criticizing him telling lies about him you know saying
[41:30.160 --> 41:34.560]  he didn't run a good campaign when he almost killed himself and his working
[41:34.560 --> 41:39.600]  so hard broke his back his wife had a frickin heart attack over the whole thing
[41:39.600 --> 41:44.520]  working her butt offline all over the country with him and they tried to
[41:44.520 --> 41:48.400]  discredit him but it didn't matter because now the number one movement on
[41:48.400 --> 41:51.760]  the college campuses was the patriot movement it wasn't liberal or fake
[41:51.760 --> 41:57.000]  conservative it was an establishment flavors of purple you know grape and
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.040]  cherry Kool-Aid it wasn't Kool-Aid folks it was good
[42:02.040 --> 42:08.400]  nutritive healthy fresh squeezed orange juice to revive the Republic from the
[42:08.400 --> 42:13.240]  scurvy we've got we're dying cuz we've been fed Kool-Aid we're living off New
[42:13.240 --> 42:17.560]  World Order Kool-Aid our teeth are falling out we need vitamin C we need
[42:17.560 --> 42:22.320]  vitamin D we need minerals we need the bill of rights we need good quality
[42:22.320 --> 42:29.120]  people and we've got them and so the movement expanded and grew so that now
[42:29.120 --> 42:32.160]  that the New World Order is engaged in their banking takeover that he talked
[42:32.160 --> 42:36.400]  about three years ago everybody remembers he told the truth he warned the
[42:36.400 --> 42:41.200]  people and so now his credibility shot up to no member of Congress as a higher
[42:41.200 --> 42:45.600]  approval rating according to the Houston Chronicle and the national poll it's
[42:45.600 --> 42:51.920]  over 80% his climbs the longer he's in office not drops the longer like every
[42:51.920 --> 42:55.800]  other establishment candidate and now Rand need to pray for him they don't
[42:55.800 --> 43:00.960]  blow up an airplane or kill him or play a dirty trick on him but they realize and
[43:00.960 --> 43:04.600]  I saw defeat in Carl Rove's eyes two days ago and he was on Fox talking about
[43:04.600 --> 43:08.680]  Rand Paul when he said he's probably gonna win you know nothing can stop these
[43:08.680 --> 43:12.520]  people and he looked upset and was basically stuttering around they
[43:12.520 --> 43:18.200]  understand there's nothing they can do if you keep taking action there's
[43:18.200 --> 43:24.240]  nothing they can do if they try to set off a nuke now folks I mean it's so much
[43:24.240 --> 43:28.280]  in the popular culture even the show Jericho was about a private contractor
[43:28.280 --> 43:33.720]  group in black ops staging nuke attacks to bring in martial law almost all the
[43:33.720 --> 43:37.920]  troops I talked to are fully aware of false flag now they're not stupid they
[43:37.920 --> 43:43.620]  already know Cheney got caught trying to steal two cruise missiles out of the
[43:43.620 --> 43:51.880]  Dakotas up there at my not that was on record look Admiral Fox Fallon wouldn't
[43:51.880 --> 43:56.120]  launch an attack on Iran three years ago and stepped down over it saying it
[43:56.120 --> 44:00.120]  could cause World War three the next guy they tried to get to do it stepped
[44:00.120 --> 44:06.880]  down do you understand ladies and gentlemen that these people are not
[44:06.880 --> 44:12.960]  invincible and so you're not going to have instant victory against these
[44:12.960 --> 44:17.320]  people you're not going to get freedom like a happy meal with a 60-second weight
[44:17.320 --> 44:21.800]  out of a McDonald's drive-thru window it is going to take time but we are going
[44:21.800 --> 44:26.840]  to win let's start going to the Brigh New Brzezinski video audio clip and it
[44:26.840 --> 44:31.720]  starts slow but it really builds up listen carefully here he is talking to
[44:31.720 --> 44:35.800]  top globalist and saying we're in trouble this is the biggest awakening ever
[44:35.800 --> 44:40.160]  this has never happened in modern history he's right it happened in the
[44:40.160 --> 44:44.160]  Renaissance and the Enlightenment in the last 400 years in Europe but never
[44:44.160 --> 44:49.320]  globally they are in trouble they are not going to be able to carry this sound
[44:49.320 --> 44:56.000]  here it is let me begin by making just a thumbnail definition of the geo
[44:56.000 --> 45:02.640]  political context in which we all find ourselves including America and in my
[45:02.640 --> 45:11.040]  perspective that geo political context is very much defined by new by two new
[45:11.040 --> 45:19.320]  global realities the first is that global political leadership by which I
[45:19.320 --> 45:25.640]  mean the role of certain leading powers in the world has now become much more
[45:25.640 --> 45:34.040]  diversified unlike what it was until relatively recently relatively recently
[45:34.040 --> 45:41.040]  still the world was dominated by the Atlantic world as it had been for many
[45:41.040 --> 45:48.000]  centuries it no longer is today the rise of the far east has created a new but
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.080]  much more differentiated global leadership one which in a nutshell
[45:53.080 --> 45:58.640]  involves if one can hazard an arbitrary list of the primary players in the
[45:58.640 --> 46:04.920]  world scene the United States clearly maybe next to it but maybe the European
[46:04.920 --> 46:10.040]  Union I say maybe because it is not yet a political entity certainly
[46:10.040 --> 46:17.560]  increasingly so and visibly so China Russia mainly in one respect only
[46:17.560 --> 46:22.960]  because it is a nuclear power co-equal to the United States but otherwise very
[46:22.960 --> 46:28.960]  deficient in all of the major indices of what constitutes global power behind
[46:28.960 --> 46:35.440]  Russia perhaps individually but to much lesser extent Germany France Great
[46:35.440 --> 46:42.000]  Britain Japan certainly although it does not have a political assertive posture
[46:42.000 --> 46:47.800]  India is rising and then in the background of that we have the new entity of G20
[46:47.800 --> 46:55.280]  and much more diversified global leadership lacking internal unity with
[46:55.280 --> 46:59.760]  many of its members in bilateral antagonisms that makes the context much
[46:59.760 --> 47:05.280]  more complicated the other major change in international affairs is that for
[47:05.280 --> 47:10.360]  the first time in all of human history
[47:10.360 --> 47:17.200]  mankind is politically awakened that's a total new reality total new reality it
[47:17.200 --> 47:22.200]  has not been so for most of human history until the last 100 years and in
[47:22.200 --> 47:26.560]  the course of the last 100 years the whole world has become politically
[47:26.560 --> 47:34.280]  awakened and no matter where you go politics is a matter of social engagement
[47:34.280 --> 47:39.840]  and most people know what is generally going on generally going on in the world
[47:39.840 --> 47:47.760]  and are consciously aware of global iniquities inequalities lack of respect
[47:47.760 --> 47:54.320]  exploitation mankind is now politically awakened and stirring the
[47:54.320 --> 47:59.080]  combination of the two a diversified global leadership politically awakened
[47:59.080 --> 48:04.800]  masses makes a much more difficult context for any major power including
[48:04.800 --> 48:10.720]  currently the leading world power all right pause back that up is then they go
[48:10.720 --> 48:15.160]  to the q&a section but but but back that up to that final point that he made
[48:15.160 --> 48:22.400]  about a minute ago where he's talking about problems see and then he goes into
[48:22.400 --> 48:28.000]  global government in the rest of the club but but here he is talking about the
[48:28.000 --> 48:35.920]  problem for one single power for a global government this is just amazing
[48:35.920 --> 48:42.200]  let's let's play that last part again inequalities lack of respect
[48:42.200 --> 48:48.560]  exploitation mankind is now politically awakened and stirring the
[48:48.560 --> 48:53.320]  combination of the two a diversified global leadership politically awakened
[48:53.320 --> 48:59.080]  masses makes a much more difficult context for any major power including
[48:59.080 --> 49:04.880]  currently the leading world power the United States but the United States is
[49:04.880 --> 49:13.240]  the new world order and here's a question and answer to him presentation but
[49:13.240 --> 49:16.800]  I'm wondering how would you rate the United Nations and it's helping solve
[49:16.800 --> 49:20.480]  some of the geopolitical problems we find some people say they're you know
[49:20.480 --> 49:24.000]  they're not adding a lot of solutions and some people even suggest we should
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.560]  have another organization internationally that can do the job that
[49:27.560 --> 49:30.960]  the United Nations should be doing and even people talking about one world
[49:30.960 --> 49:37.120]  governments I mean how do you view the UN right now well you know there should
[49:37.120 --> 49:43.400]  be such an organization the word should implies that there is a kind of moral
[49:43.400 --> 49:49.960]  imperative or need for it but it doesn't exist why doesn't exist because we don't
[49:49.960 --> 49:55.920]  have a situation in which there is a concentrated source of power that has
[49:55.920 --> 50:01.760]  universal reach not even America has that so the United Nations functions well
[50:01.760 --> 50:08.400]  in areas in which it is possible to generate consensus and that deals usually
[50:08.400 --> 50:14.400]  with elements pertaining to human suffering or to well-being or to health
[50:14.400 --> 50:18.160]  for example the food organization the health organization the relief
[50:18.160 --> 50:25.880]  agencies or arbitration of conflicts of secondary importance in which the
[50:25.880 --> 50:29.880]  international community can kind of endorse what the UN is doing but the UN
[50:29.880 --> 50:34.000]  is not a world government the UN when it comes to politics is based on the
[50:34.000 --> 50:41.200]  fiction namely hundred and ninety states which are members each of which is
[50:41.200 --> 50:48.040]  co-equal with the others except for the five that have defeated right alright in
[50:48.040 --> 50:51.240]  the Security Council we're gonna go to break and and and come back but as you
[50:51.240 --> 50:55.040]  hear that you know what can't the UN be our world government he says well it
[50:55.040 --> 51:03.680]  isn't yet but we need one you see global meltdowns massive unemployment
[51:03.680 --> 51:08.840]  endless wars a new currency crisis financially and morally bankrupt a

[54:16.960 --> 54:20.640]  government why is the CFR now talking about world government in their public
[54:20.640 --> 54:24.760]  televised meetings something they've never done previously because now we can
[54:24.760 --> 54:28.840]  have a real debate we've ignored them we've said shut up liars we've read all
[54:28.840 --> 54:33.160]  your documents we've read your internal documents we know what you're setting up
[54:33.160 --> 54:37.440]  and so they can't play the game anymore because we're awake for the first time in
[54:37.440 --> 54:41.560]  history the planet is now awake we can start having a real debate do we want an
[54:41.560 --> 54:49.000]  unelected authoritarian world government running our society is this
[54:49.000 --> 54:53.760]  something that we want now they always push it at the university level and I've
[54:53.760 --> 54:57.160]  literally gotten thousands of emails over the years I see it in comments
[54:57.160 --> 55:01.960]  almost all our videos on YouTube and other video channels it's always the
[55:01.960 --> 55:06.840]  same thing I like Star Trek I mean they had a global government in that and you
[55:06.840 --> 55:11.880]  know this is about world unity and the end of wars and peace and humans went
[55:11.880 --> 55:17.120]  from hunter-gatherer societies to agrarian farmers to city-states to
[55:17.120 --> 55:24.440]  nations and this is the next step do you want Chinese or Germans or Russians
[55:24.440 --> 55:29.800]  deciding what America does no you want to represent yourself you want to have
[55:29.800 --> 55:34.200]  your own country with your own culture humans are tribal this is what we do I
[55:34.200 --> 55:38.840]  don't want to merge with the UN with the hundred plus dictators and thugs that
[55:38.840 --> 55:42.600]  are involved in the 190 members I don't want to be under their control the
[55:42.600 --> 55:46.600]  Pentagon created the UN in 45 to set up their world government the Pentagon
[55:46.600 --> 55:51.080]  doesn't belong to America we have to realize this we have to understand that
[55:51.080 --> 55:56.600]  national sovereignty is a firewall against tyranny against people like
[55:56.600 --> 55:59.080]  Hitler and Stalin what would have happened if there would have been a
[55:59.080 --> 56:02.440]  world government body that Hitler could have gotten control of what would have
[56:02.440 --> 56:07.720]  happened he would have had the surveillance system we see now today
[56:08.120 --> 56:12.840]  think about it ladies and gentlemen think about what the big new Brzezinski
[56:12.840 --> 56:20.480]  was just saying think about what he's pushing think about how they're now out
[56:20.480 --> 56:25.080]  in the open saying we're in trouble our systems in trouble people are awake
[56:25.080 --> 56:31.160]  politically that's a bad thing they know now they're bluff they're scam they're
[56:31.160 --> 56:35.400]  spell their mind control the haze they had over people has lifted
[56:35.400 --> 56:40.680]  and we're starting to have a real debate and it's only going to accelerate
[56:40.680 --> 56:46.920]  it's only going to get worse for them it's only going to expand and so now
[56:46.920 --> 56:49.800]  they're openly coming out and not just admitting world government they're
[56:49.800 --> 56:52.280]  saying yeah we want to ban free speech yeah we want to take your private

[57:16.600 --> 57:20.280]  that's happening because they know they've lost control
[57:20.280 --> 57:25.080]  of people's brains they've lost control it's over
[57:25.080 --> 57:29.240]  it's over mentally now do we physically put it into action to take our

[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.280]  the open but sigma brzezinski top global planner
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:22.040]  he's probably the number one top planner who's currently in government
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:25.480]  with obama he's been in every administration
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:28.520]  openly calls for world government brags about how
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.960]  he helped fund poll pot to kill 30 percent of their population
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:37.560]  i mean just a truly evil person cfr meetings of big brzezinski fears the

[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:28.600]  we've had insiders on in the fema meetings uh where they talk about this
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:33.320]  being a national property tax also naked scanners may increase cancer risk we
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:35.720]  already knew that but now it's in mainstream news
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:39.960]  uh it just continues tsa agent accused of stealing cash
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:45.880]  from wheelchair bound woman he's been arrested i mean they just hire thugs and
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:48.840]  not all of them but i mean a lot of them means just look at the craziness
[01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:52.200]  every control for you can imagine you can't even get a job as a toilet attendant

[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.480]  you see berkeley asking incoming students for dna
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:06.440]  and they're trying to pass that law in the house right now when they
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:10.760]  arrest you for any reason to take your blood well why not
[01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:15.400]  they're just getting you ready for global dna databases they've already set up
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:18.520]  been covering this for 14 years but finally six years ago
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:21.880]  in australia it's a global program under the un
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.200]  the pentagon holds the samples here in the us one with major universities they
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:29.480]  they've had uh murder cases where they go don't worry we already have his blood
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.520]  we already have it you know he's 30 years old we got this 30 years ago he was
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:37.000]  born they take your blood at birth for 38 years globally
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.200]  we've been in a global government for 38 years
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:44.600]  everything started 38 years ago 37 years ago they started the global echelon
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:49.720]  system then spying on everyone they we're already under a world government
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:53.960]  that dominates europe the Mediterranean
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:58.440]  north america uh much of asia
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:11:02.120]  and of course australia new zealand it's already here
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:06.760]  and they've sold derivatives to all these other governments to bankrupt them
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:10.120]  so the financial system can come in and take them over through economic
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:14.280]  domination economic conquest
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:20.680]  this is a economic infasura an invasion and we must come together
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:24.520]  that's why hollywood's throwing out all the stops with racial division all
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:27.560]  these movies coming out of your pro second amendment pro sovereignty
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:32.760]  you're a racist that wants to kill people uh they are just trying to divide us
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:37.480]  but it isn't going to work their only hope is staging wars terror attacks
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.720]  and divide and conquer balkanization division
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:45.640]  so i'll open the phones up on that subject and again just such incredible
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:51.240]  news uh rand paul savages obama is catastrophic green economy global
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:56.920]  government 30 plus percentage points

[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:05.000]  30 plus points on top of the establishment candidate who had all the
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.440]  banker money ai g gulman sacks just flooding him
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:12.200]  all the big neocon publications attacking rand paul trying to drag me into
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.840]  it because he comes on the show didn't work
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:20.120]  it ain't gonna work go ahead attacking say he's a radical say he's bad
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.640]  lie about it people know you're such discredited frauds
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.400]  that when you attack him that's the seal of
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.120]  bona fide
[01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:35.640]  meanwhile mexican pirates attacking fisherman in the gulf of mexico and in
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:40.280]  texas lakes it's getting serious let's go ahead and talk to jonathan in
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:45.480]  kansas you're on the air yes i want to talk about
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:49.560]  about that uh mexican communists uh
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.640]  ron coches i want to bring to your attention that
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:58.040]  in that video recalls for a revolution or whatever
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.880]  he attacks white people for being racist but
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:06.680]  uh did you notice that he labeled all latin people as being one people
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:10.120]  without their own cultures anything don't you think that's hypocritical
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:14.760]  no he's telling you you're under me you're not with the raza
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.960]  if you're not a communist it's just a political weapon and that's what the
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.120]  ford foundation with 40 plus billion dollars on record
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:25.480]  they fund that in the universities with grants
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:30.520]  they don't want the latin people to say i want private property i'm hard working
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:33.560]  and smart i want to have guns to protect myself
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:37.080]  i don't want a i don't know what the word means but tony montana says that a
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:41.080]  chavano on every corner uh you know telling you what to do
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.600]  what to eat what to wear when to sleep uh you know
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:48.760]  you a sheep i mean basically they want to be able to tell
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:51.720]  anybody south of the border or in the united states
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.560]  that they look hispanic students couldn't wear american flags
[01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:59.480]  that's how brainwash these other students were that that was a threat
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:02.760]  i mean and that's what the government's funding go ahead jonathan
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:06.520]  yes i also want to say two other things real quickly
[01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:09.880]  one are you aware that the 2008 election
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:16.200]  was the first time two uh two candidates were born outside of america
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:21.800]  john mccain was born in panama yes i was aware of that john mccain lied
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:25.240]  and again this is all about setting precedence he lied and said he was born
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:29.240]  in a base so it would have been legal the base didn't exist until 20
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.760]  plus years after he was born he was born on a naval ship
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:36.280]  in the panama canal and at that time they've now since changed the rules for
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.440]  military overseas which i think is fine to where he was ineligible
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:45.880]  with bush uh both bush and cheney were from texas on their tax returns
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.640]  that's illegal to have the president and vice presidential nominees
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:54.680]  from the same state they did that again they desecrate our laws
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:58.280]  obama violated article one section onto the constitution to become the first
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.600]  u.s. sitting president to be the head of the u.n.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.200]  security council and swear an oath to him that's totally illegal
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:07.400]  again that's why they had kissinger and brzezinski in the audience
[01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:10.360]  and they were all gasping and smiling like they had just
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:14.760]  passed some magic threshold because they're they're desecrating our laws
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:20.760]  setting legal precedent and so yes sir the and there's no doubt mccain was not
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:24.840]  born in the u.s. and was ineligible and there's no doubt obama gave up his
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.560]  citizenship in indonesia and all the evidence shows he was born in kenya
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:33.960]  okay okay one more thing uh this is about darpa
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:37.000]  are you aware about are you aware of project
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.040]  aspen movie map
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:47.640]  say say that again project aspen as an aspen colorado
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:52.200]  aspen movie map well that well that's basically
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.640]  in my opinion it looks like the precursor to
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:01.720]  google street view we all know that cia create cia in nsa
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:05.480]  founded google so if you look that up on youtube
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:10.040]  they have clips of aspen movie map that was created with the help of mit
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:14.360]  mit helped create the internet well they also created the code for google i
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:18.680]  appreciate your call now we first broke here five years ago the cia officer
[01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:23.320]  mr. steel that google was a cia front now it's completely admitted
[01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:26.840]  in cutel of course gave him a lot of the funding as well i admitted
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:30.600]  cia uh funding consortium through darpa
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.960]  let's talk to fred in oklahoma fred you're on the air
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:37.960]  alex good talk to you sir welcome one of the
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:43.560]  one of the main little items that says that we are waking up everybody
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:48.280]  was miss oklahoma spoutin the two most magical words ever which was
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:53.400]  states rights in the uh... beauty contest last week
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.600]  well you know we covered this on monday
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:00.600]  uh... the uh... larry conquista judge asked her
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:03.960]  if if if she was against the arizona law and then a few people booed
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:08.280]  and he said don't boo yet and then she said well i support states rights
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:12.120]  and it was ten to one cheers you can barely hear the booze
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:17.000]  and then she and again i never watched beauty pageants but sunday night
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.160]  when it was live i ended my sunday show at six
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:24.280]  i went in i was gonna stay late and do some other work i ordered a pizza for
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:27.640]  the crew the pizza had just gotten here
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.440]  i turned on the television set in the first channel
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:33.320]  uh... was the channel that had it on so i watched about five minutes when the
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:37.400]  it guys was back there with me and it showed them all
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:40.840]  trot out all the contestants and i thought that
[01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:45.400]  me personally she had the best poise uh had the most intelligence in her eyes
[01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:49.240]  that's what i'm looking for miss oklahoma and i remember being you know
[01:17:49.240 --> 01:17:52.200]  drawn to her out of all the other women
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:58.280]  and then uh... i wasn't even aware on monday when we played her clip that she'd
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:02.440]  been the runner-up and had lost uh... to the other lady and i think the
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:07.000]  lebanese woman was beautiful uh... but i mean i'm telling you nothing compared
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:12.760]  uh... to the other one and uh... later the judge admitted he voted against her
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:16.680]  because of that so she would have won if she would have
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:21.160]  betrayed america and betrayed the state rights and so that's the message
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:24.120]  that's why those beauty queens always have to get up and say i love the u n i
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:27.880]  love world government oh i wanna i'm against the second amendment boom
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:32.360]  they win i mean they could run alana kagan uh... up against those other
[01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:35.640]  beauty queen people she looks like a toad and if you know if she went out
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.520]  there and spoke for open borders she'd be the beauty queen
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.800]  uh... now the other woman's better looking than alana kagan but uh you know i
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:46.440]  think that uh... clearly i think miss oklahoma should have won
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:49.160]  uh... and it's disgusting any other comments
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:53.160]  i just think that she did win by being standing up
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.520]  for the constitution because that's another one thing that she could have
[01:18:56.520 --> 01:19:00.840]  done well we want to get her on the show we want to get her on the show
[01:19:00.840 --> 01:19:04.760]  we haven't heard anything from her or about her in oklahoma
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:08.440]  of course we're a little proud of her but it's like they have put her in a
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:12.200]  box and kept her locked away i think that

[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.840]  by the way in america over seventy percent of americans and polls agree with
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.320]  that whether you agree with it or not the issue is
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:34.360]  she should be able to have her view why is this political

[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.160]  just tuned in the establishment is in panic every
[01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.160]  incumbent republican and democrat out there and every candidate seen as
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.760]  establishment whether it's arland specter or
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:51.640]  tray grason in kentucky is losing in the primaries same thing happened two weeks
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:54.760]  ago in utah with the republican establishment
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:58.520]  candidate losing the primary to a tea partier a real tea partier
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.040]  see the republican party said we've got to take over the tea party
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:05.480]  and they've been unsuccessful they've had their own tea party events and the
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.600]  the controlled left media played along with it
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.800]  saying it was all run by sarah palin and john mccain
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:14.920]  uh... but that's all backfiring right now
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:20.280]  that is all backfiring and so this again is very very exciting
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:23.800]  uh... let's go to johnny in wyoming johnny you're on the air
[01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:27.560]  uh... hi alex god can you hear me
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.400]  uh... hello alex yes or go ahead uh... yeah
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:35.400]  um... i'm half time and i grew up in
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:40.040]  uh... california and i've been living in thailand for the last six years
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:43.640]  and um... i i thought the article
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:48.520]  um... thailand's toxin shinawatra marxist and the n w o
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:51.960]  on infowars dot com and uh... i have a little
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:56.360]  like special insight about what's going on in thailand and let me say this we've
[01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:00.440]  we've published articles on both sides and the phones are open
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:05.480]  and uh... we don't know exactly what's going on one of our geopolitical experts
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:09.640]  uh... says that it's murky and that both sides have issues and that the ties
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:14.360]  themselves are angry uh... but now give us your perspective
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:19.880]  um... yeah all right um... in thailand uh...
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.800]  there's a red yellow paradigm just like the left
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:27.400]  uh... the left right paradigm here in the west and
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.840]  pretty much uh... the red shirt um...
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:35.960]  therefore the poor farmers and you know they have little education
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:39.960]  and they are paid by uh... the former prime minister taxing
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:45.160]  shinawatra one thousand baht per day to demonstrate on the front line
[01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.440]  and uh... the government right now it's
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:52.760]  the yellow government and they represent pretty much
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:56.520]  like the middle class and the bank hawk elite that
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:00.840]  support the king and the royal family and
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:05.400]  um... like in thailand the king has like a godlike status
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:09.240]  sometimes literally like worship him ridiculous
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:12.840]  um... like at high schools
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:17.000]  um... at an early age kids go to school and they're taught
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:20.760]  love the king and you know i understand i've i've i've met
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:23.960]  ty folks here in town and then to their houses and they've got
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:27.640]  photographs of the king up there and they literally just
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:31.320]  a revering but but expanding on that and the limited time we have here
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.240]  because this isn't really on subject uh... specifically give us your bottom line on
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.760]  what's really happening in thailand
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:43.240]  well the yellow government they they pretty much
[01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:48.040]  own the thai mainstream media and the yellows control all the universities
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:51.240]  and pretty much if you speak out against
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:54.760]  the king or the yellows and or the royal family
[01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:59.720]  you know you're labeled as like not a real ty you're labeled as a traitor to
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:03.320]  the ty race pretty much labeled as scum and
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:06.280]  if somebody hears you they can call the police
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:09.720]  and you can be hauled off to jail for expressing these views
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.800]  yeah i've uh... read that and i think that's wrong
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:18.120]  and uh... but at a geopolitical level the globalist are trying to throw out the
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:20.680]  monarchy to bring in their banker monarchy
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:24.600]  so i think ties have to ask themselves which which form of uh...
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.280]  tyranny they want whether they want to work in the system to reform it or
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:33.640]  become uh... vassals uh... outside powers that i assure you will rape you
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:37.160]  seven waves to sunday uh... but look i've said i'm sympathetic to anybody with
[01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:41.480]  slingshots fighting troops uh... so we've tried to cover both sides here
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:47.240]  um... alex you know the king has has ties to the rockefellers the world bank
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:49.960]  the imf oh yeah the globalist are gonna are
[01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:52.600]  are gonna work with whoever's in power i look i'm
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.800]  i've tried to study thailand and what's happening in bangkok
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:59.080]  and i'll just be honest with you that's why i've deferred on this
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:03.320]  uh... because uh... you know history and societies and cultures aren't just
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.640]  something you can claim you're an expert on
[01:29:05.640 --> 01:29:08.360]  i mean i know more than probably ninety five percent of people about thailand
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:11.080]  i've done some research we've had guests on about it
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:15.400]  uh... but uh... i mean i know i've said that there's a lot of corruption
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:19.480]  on the yellow side but it looks pretty corrupt with the red sides doing
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:23.560]  and see that's the issue people have this mindset that it's either one side's
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:27.480]  good the other side's bad no iran
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:32.200]  is run by pretty oppressive corrupt people but our government is run by even
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.960]  more evil people and it's wrong to want to attack iran it's like i don't like
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:39.880]  hugo chavez and i don't like our government trying to overthrow them
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:44.840]  uh... so it's it's it's evil in high places is the problem
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:48.120]  but i appreciate your call sir uh... more call straight ahead eric james

[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:12.120]  where personal health preferences are concerned as of january first 2010
[01:31:12.120 --> 01:31:15.560]  codex elementarius was implemented within the european union
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:19.080]  resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:23.320]  including colloidal silver we must take immediate steps to assure a continuing
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:26.680]  supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families
[01:31:26.680 --> 01:31:29.880]  action out to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement
[01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:33.160]  in the privacy of your own home colloidal silver is a powerful
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:36.680]  antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:40.680]  alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous unpredictable side effects

[01:32:00.120 --> 01:32:03.880]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:07.000]  hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.360]  did you know that in a real meltdown non hybrid seeds could become more
[01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:13.640]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds at all perform even
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:16.920]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.720]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:22.840]  have put together the perfect mix of non hybrid seeds

[01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:56.760]  in a real crisis non hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item
[01:32:56.760 --> 01:33:07.560]  this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:11.160]  all right we're back live my friends william geene joining us in the next
[01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:14.200]  hour i want to go back to your phone calls
[01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:19.000]  but i wanted to play a clip one more time i was a big new brazinski making
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.200]  quite an admission and i'm seeing similar admissions from the rand
[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:26.360]  corporation the un the club of rome the state
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:30.200]  department and others that they tried to lie to the public and deny they were
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:33.640]  forming a global corporate government for the administrative convenience of
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:39.720]  central bankers which they believe is much better than the former
[01:33:39.720 --> 01:33:43.560]  auto determination of nation states that's basically a quote from david
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:47.880]  rockerfeller i'm paraphrasing their almost word for word
[01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.560]  that just pulled me up the david rockerfeller quote so i'm exact
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:56.040]  david rockerfeller world government quote there's a bunch of them but
[01:33:56.040 --> 01:34:00.520]  it's the one about a world government for the administrative convenience
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:05.080]  of world bankers private central bankers
[01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:08.840]  there's many variants of that the point is that
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:12.040]  that they would deny all this was going on forever
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.880]  and now they're not denying it so i want to get back into that take your phone

[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:27.880]  i cannot describe to you how big of a deal
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:34.120]  it is to have van kyman secretary general the un herman von rumpi
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:40.360]  unelected head of the eu former prime minister gordon brown
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:43.960]  al gore all these world leaders coming out and saying
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:47.720]  we're setting up a world government based on global carbon taxes
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:52.280]  a global constitution of the g20 controlling the planet's currencies
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:55.560]  national currencies that are under the auspices
[01:36:55.560 --> 01:37:00.360]  and are pegged to the sdr's now why have they done that
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.920]  this was a big thing for them in the last two years
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:07.240]  to shift from denying they were setting up oral government for the last 50
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:10.680]  as they were setting it up thousands of their internal documents
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:14.520]  fell into our hands they published many of them in scholarly reports knowing
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:17.240]  you wouldn't be reading them that's how arrogant they are
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:22.200]  thinking all you care about is you know baseball and football and partying
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:25.720]  well brzezinski explains why and i'm seeing this in more and more reports
[01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:29.160]  why they've now and of course i said this years ago the last two years they've
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:32.760]  shifted from denying all of this to admitting that it's real
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:37.080]  because they've passed that cost benefit point
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:40.920]  where if we lie about world government that'll discredit us with people that
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:45.080]  find out we are setting it up but they're such a small minority
[01:37:45.080 --> 01:37:48.440]  we want to sneak up on the world population with this global corporate
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:51.560]  takeover so we're going to go ahead and lie
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:54.520]  but in the last two years and i think a few years late
[01:37:54.520 --> 01:37:57.160]  they should have done this a decade ago they were smart
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:01.160]  they went from denying it to admitting it and even admitting that it's
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:04.760]  authoritarian remember two years ago or about a year and a half ago
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:09.800]  said the obama deception scores of articles time magazine newsweek but
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:13.240]  especially the financial times of london
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:17.160]  said and now for world government that was the headline
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.920]  and now for world government and why did they say and now for world
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:23.640]  government well he goes on to say we built it
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:26.920]  quietly we built it in stealth yes it's authoritarian
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:31.480]  you don't know what's good for you this is to save the earth
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:39.000]  and yes the bilberberg groups real okay so
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:42.040]  not only do they admit it's a world government but that it's unelected and
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:45.400]  unaccountable to you because they know better
[01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:49.800]  and then of course in every case they rob you with this system they've built
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:53.320]  and torture and secret arrest and dna databases
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:57.240]  is what these people put in to place in every country they control
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:39:00.440]  they are tyrants they don't want free speech they don't want
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:04.520]  private property for the general public only for themselves it's all selectively
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:08.360]  enforced it's a super elite destroying anybody
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:14.440]  who has two cents to rub together now you have all that going on and you have
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:17.960]  some big brazilian ski at a televised cfr meeting
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:21.880]  admitting there's been a global awakening to the new world order
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:25.880]  the g20 is our best shot at world government but it's in fighting
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:28.920]  and we already played that part of the clip it's a long clip last hour the full
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:34.520]  unedited clip is up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com right now
[01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:38.920]  but then the first question he gets is you know don't we need to use the u n as
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:41.960]  a world government and he goes on to explain that it's basically impotent
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:46.280]  that yes they want a world government but there's no single power big enough
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:49.800]  to enforce the world government so he also admits the u s
[01:39:49.800 --> 01:39:53.240]  is the main bulldog and the main engine of the world government
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:57.480]  destroying our sovereignty while we're used to destroy other people's sovereignty
[01:39:57.480 --> 01:40:01.880]  with economic warfare with invasions uh... selling rebels weapons
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:04.600]  uh... selling neighboring countries weapons
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:07.640]  uh... state department random two hundred were kissing your talks about
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:10.840]  selling weapons to a neighboring country to attack the next country
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:15.320]  to create population reduction i mean this is ruthless
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.680]  and this is the great game where they play nations and groups and people off
[01:40:18.680 --> 01:40:21.720]  against each other that's what races films like machete are about
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.160]  getting us all fighting with each other because of the globalist can't make us
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:29.160]  in fight they're going to lose but his big admission is
[01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:32.040]  the people are now awake as i said two years ago
[01:40:32.040 --> 01:40:37.080]  they made a a decision that wasn't announced but you can see the decision
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:40.600]  suddenly hundreds of articles a week admitting it's authoritarian world
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:43.480]  government but that it's for your own good
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:48.920]  remember that for the world government and telling you it's good and yes they've
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:51.960]  been trying to set it up and poor them they're having trouble
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.200]  because people are awake clearly they passed that point
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:40:59.880]  where lying about it was only discrediting them so now they shifted
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:03.160]  into telling you okay world government is a good thing
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:06.200]  but they still think cops are dumber than the general public
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:09.880]  because they still teach police in all their training manuals that it doesn't
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:13.880]  exist and that if you talk about it the person talking about world government
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:18.120]  wants to kill cops it's just very elementary brainwashing
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:21.560]  hey if you hear somebody saying there's a banking takeover a world government
[01:41:21.560 --> 01:41:24.840]  be careful they want to kill you that's in the
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:28.200]  all the different adl southern poverty law center mayac homeland security
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.600]  reports that we received from law enforcement
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:34.520]  a year and a half ago now that's all public
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:40.200]  see so but they've almost completely converted over from saying it doesn't
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:45.320]  exist to admitting it exists because for the first time in history and i agree
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:49.160]  with him the renaissance was only localized
[01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:53.000]  via the printing press again information that's what the Gutenberg
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.640]  press generated that in the last 400 years
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:01.560]  but now this is worldwide the populations are looking past
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:05.400]  the globalist puppets over their nations to the actual string pullers
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:09.640]  so let's go ahead and go to this video clip here it is
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:13.000]  the other major change in international affairs is
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:19.160]  that for the first time in all of human history
[01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:23.720]  mankind is politically awakened that's a total new reality
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:28.200]  total new reality it has not been so for most of human history
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:32.520]  until the last 100 years and in the course of the last 100 years
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:35.640]  the whole world has become politically awakened
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:43.560]  and no matter where you go politics is a matter of social engagement
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:48.600]  and most people know what is generally going on generally going on in the world
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:53.080]  and are consciously aware of global iniquities
[01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:59.160]  inequalities lack of respect exploitation
[01:42:59.160 --> 01:43:02.360]  mankind is now politically awakened and stirring
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:06.360]  the combination of the two a diversified global leadership
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:10.760]  politically awakened masses makes a much more difficult context
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:14.440]  for any major power including currently
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:20.760]  the leading world power the united states
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:23.960]  i really enjoyed your presentation but i'm wondering how would you rate the
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:27.000]  united nations and it's helping solve some of the geopolitical
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:30.520]  problems we've had some people say they're you know they're not adding
[01:43:30.520 --> 01:43:33.720]  a lot of solutions and and some people even say we should have another
[01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:37.880]  organization internationally that can do the job that the united nation should
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:40.280]  be doing and even people talking about one world
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:44.280]  governments i mean how do you view the un right now
[01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:48.600]  well you know there should be such an organization the word should implies
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:55.480]  that there is a kind of moral imperative or need for it
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:00.840]  but it doesn't exist why doesn't exist because we don't have a situation
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:04.760]  in which there is a concentrated source of power
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:08.760]  that has universal reach not even america has that
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:12.680]  so the united nations functions well in areas
[01:44:12.680 --> 01:44:16.440]  in which it is possible to generate consensus
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:21.320]  and that deals usually with elements pertaining to human suffering
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:26.120]  or to well-being or to health for example the food organization the health
[01:44:26.120 --> 01:44:30.440]  organization the relief agencies or arbitration
[01:44:30.440 --> 01:44:35.640]  of okay conflicts of and basically earlier he talked about the g20 is the
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:37.880]  best mode they've got for the world government
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:41.800]  and imagine how outrageous this is private central banks that have engineered
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:47.320]  the financial collapse on record that's now public knowledge
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:51.640]  are saying we're going to form a world government that issues a magic digital
[01:44:51.640 --> 01:44:54.920]  currency that you've got to buy from us
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:59.480]  with interest backed up by real assets
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:04.680]  i mean why not just go pick some whinoa off the street corner and make them god
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:09.000]  and you know put their face on some money and and and then we have to pay them
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.080]  interest to have it
[01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:19.080]  think about that and that's why if we point out that they're illegitimate
[01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:27.240]  autocratic authoritarian and that it's immoral what they're doing
[01:45:27.240 --> 01:45:29.640]  then there's no way they can put this into place
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:33.720]  and that's why they're so scared and that's why they're going okay there is a
[01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:36.920]  world government you know we're trying to set it up for your own good it's god's
[01:45:36.920 --> 01:45:40.520]  work it's a moral imperative a moral imperative
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:46.760]  this is a guy who brags about how he funded in the
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:51.000]  later administration of jimmy carter that the operations with pole pot
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.560]  that killed 30 of the population conservatively
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:56.760]  these guys are in to what they do these are
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:01.480]  eugenicists at every level who want you dead they don't just want your property
[01:46:01.480 --> 01:46:04.200]  they want you and your kids off of it
[01:46:04.200 --> 01:46:09.960]  skulls out there on the back 40 and that's the next level of awakening the
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:13.560]  public is now awoken to the fact there is a world government run by banks
[01:46:13.560 --> 01:46:18.840]  the public had better wake up fast to the fact that this world government
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:21.880]  is murderous and that they compete with each other
[01:46:21.880 --> 01:46:26.280]  in the power structure in the pyramidal system for who is the most cunning
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:29.880]  the most ruthless they believe in social Darwinism
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:33.240]  survival of the fittest they believe whatever they do to murder and kill and
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:38.360]  steal and poison is a moral reflection of their
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:43.560]  sickening humanism their form of humanism
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:47.160]  yeah here's a david rocket feller quote the super national sovereignty of an
[01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:50.520]  intellectual elite and world bankers is surely preferable
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:53.160]  to the national auto determination practice in
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:57.240]  past centuries here's another one from his
[01:46:57.240 --> 01:47:01.560]  book memoirs published five years ago for more than a century ideological
[01:47:01.560 --> 01:47:04.600]  extremist at either end of the political spectrum have seized upon
[01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:08.840]  well-publicized incidents to attack the rocket feller family
[01:47:08.840 --> 01:47:13.000]  for the inordinate influence they claim we wailed over american political and
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:16.680]  economic institutions some even believe we are part of a secret cabal
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:19.880]  well we know you are working against the best interests of the united states
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:23.320]  characterizing my family and me as internationalist
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:26.520]  and conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:29.720]  global political economic structure one world if you will
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:34.520]  if that is the charge i stand guilty
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:40.280]  and proud of it so that's what's going on here
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:43.800]  and we actually own that book it's it's it's it's here in the office
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:48.120]  um i want to go back to your calls here but but i want to go back to what's
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:54.280]  happening nationwide uh the media is really starting to flounder
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:58.440]  and panic and they're saying oh my gosh uh the fact that
[01:47:58.440 --> 01:48:02.040]  all these anti-incumbent anti-establishment candidates are winning
[01:48:02.040 --> 01:48:05.240]  whether they're democrats or republicans in both republican and democratic
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:10.280]  primaries whoever is an incumbent or seen as an establishment candidate is
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:14.200]  losing senator robert f bennett a few weeks ago in
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:18.040]  utah way more money and media time and the media got
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:21.640]  behind him he's still lost to an anti-globalist
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:27.800]  a tea partier same thing 33 points above
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:34.440]  Grayson in kentucky ran poll the polls showed he was going to win between 22
[01:48:34.440 --> 01:48:37.480]  points and 15 points the average was about 18
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:41.080]  well you see it was even bigger than that okay and
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:44.920]  uh the polls now show he is going to murder uh politically
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:48.440]  uh the democrat and so if he doesn't win we know it's rigged
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:55.240]  uh in kentucky arland specter gone gone in the democratic primary and i would
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:58.520]  imagine the democrat will be seen associated with obama
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:01.800]  uh in pennsylvania and will probably lose against the republican
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:05.480]  uh same thing happening in all the other races in every
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:09.640]  race these people are in trouble and what did ran poll get up and say in his
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:13.320]  victory speech for the primary and that was the big hurdle
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:16.440]  he said this is a message for washington we're taking our government back
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:19.800]  and we're not going to have your carbon taxes for your world government over in
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:27.160]  copenhagen those videos are up on info wars dot com right now so this is so
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:32.040]  important that everyone get this information out to everyone they know
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:36.440]  ran poll again has really thrown down the gauntlet
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:42.200]  and the more hardcore our rhetoric is the more truthful it is the more we just
[01:49:42.200 --> 01:49:45.640]  throw the gauntlet down and tell it like it is the faster we're going to defeat
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:49.160]  these people they are not invincible they are scared
[01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:53.960]  they have miscalculated they are illegitimate and they will be defeated
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:49:57.640]  in fact paul watson is now just posted an article dealing with his key
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:02.280]  c span is a big new brazinski clip it's brazinski decries
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:09.080]  global political awakening during cfr speech it is a very important article
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:12.360]  that paul joseph watson has written at prisonplanet
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:16.760]  dot com so i want to ask everyone to go and
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:20.760]  get this article brazinski decries global political awakening during cfr
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:24.280]  speech i mean this is an enemy communicate
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:27.960]  because even though they know we're awake and and and now they're just trying
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:30.520]  to go public with it the arrogance comes out
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:34.040]  they still don't understand how we're going to use this clip and the clip of
[01:50:34.040 --> 01:50:38.440]  chaining at the cfr on c span saying
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:41.960]  you know i used to head up the council on farm relations but i
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:45.640]  covered that up when i was back home in wyoming everybody laughed
[01:50:45.640 --> 01:50:49.080]  oh it's so like when bill gates laughs about we got a vaccinate everybody to
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:52.520]  cut population by half and the whole audience of sickos clap and
[01:50:52.520 --> 01:50:55.320]  giggle on their little demonic murdering power trip
[01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:59.640]  those monkeys don't know we're watching them
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:04.520]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing

[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:51.240]  because he comes on this show and then some of the neocons they're trying to
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:53.880]  infiltrate are like oh don't be involved with alex jones
[02:02:53.880 --> 02:02:57.240]  the pauls aren't stupid they know when the system attacks them
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:01.080]  of being coup conspiracy terrorist that only makes them more popular
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:04.840]  when the media attacks somebody the public knows they're good
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:08.680]  it doesn't work anymore no it isn't going to work anymore and then when you
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:11.000]  see your name on here and a lot of people that never heard of you that
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:13.800]  there's gonna probably you're gonna get some hits now they want to know the
[02:03:13.800 --> 02:03:17.560]  truth people we are getting a couple hits yeah we are getting a few visitors

[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:28.760]  oh that's that's incredible and you know i like the kansas caller said we
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:31.560]  we still have to keep the dirt hole but there's still a lot of work to do we
[02:03:31.560 --> 02:03:34.360]  still have to get these films out i'm still burning copies of the obama
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:37.960]  still a lot of work to do we're not even winning the war yet we've won some
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:41.880]  battles but they won so many battles before we got in the fight but what we've
[02:03:41.880 --> 02:03:46.840]  learned is every time we fight we win it resistance is victory
[02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:50.440]  the spirit of resistance with liberty animating it
[02:03:50.440 --> 02:03:54.440]  is invincible now the globalists are mad though they're going to wreck the
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:57.240]  economy faster they're going to steal everything
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:01.400]  even if we kick them out that they'd probably set off some nukes as they left
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:05.720]  i mean they're very upset so this isn't going to be fun
[02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:08.520]  you know it's like when you break your leg and a bone sticking out the side
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:12.120]  you got to go in and get surgery and it it it feels bad but at least
[02:04:12.120 --> 02:04:15.960]  you know you you save your leg uh and so it's not going to be fun ladies and
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:20.440]  gentlemen but we're going to win win win and our great grandchildren are going

[02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:10.360]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:17.400]  williamgain.com alipak.us he heads up american for legal immigration
[02:08:17.400 --> 02:08:21.720]  pack the biggest in the country and the no compromise group
[02:08:21.720 --> 02:08:27.880]  a month ago here on the show he outed what is well known in washington
[02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:32.120]  they're not even making an issue out of this with the anti-free speech probe
[02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:35.480]  and border anti-second amendment supreme court nominee
[02:08:35.480 --> 02:08:39.000]  alina kagan but that's how they bribe them that's how they
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:42.760]  extort them that's how they compromise them look what they do in their bedrooms
[02:08:42.760 --> 02:08:46.440]  their issue though i don't want to look at alina
[02:08:46.440 --> 02:08:50.760]  kagan it makes me physically nauseous so does looking at these other people
[02:08:50.760 --> 02:08:54.280]  just because they're such you know demonic tyrants
[02:08:54.280 --> 02:09:00.680]  he outed uh lindsay graham and then lindsay graham
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:05.160]  and mr. gain has also worked in congress suddenly backed off open borders
[02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:09.080]  suddenly backed off carbon taxes suddenly apologized for health care
[02:09:09.080 --> 02:09:12.040]  because they were bribing him the whole time they were they were extorting him
[02:09:12.040 --> 02:09:14.440]  clearly i guess bribed not the right word it's a
[02:09:14.440 --> 02:09:18.840]  reverse of that blackmailing him and a big weight lifted off of graham
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:22.920]  because now if they come out and and and out him in the mainstream media
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:26.280]  it's only going to point out that they knew all along so these people just need
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:29.720]  to come out of the closet so they can't be blackmailed that's why it's wrong
[02:09:29.720 --> 02:09:33.320]  to have this going on up there in washington but that's a separate issue
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:37.320]  i wanted to talk to him about the fact that specter has fallen

[02:10:31.080 --> 02:10:34.680]  immigration law is forcing our people to face discrimination so
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:39.320]  his people in america imagine if we had an american president with 30 million
[02:10:39.320 --> 02:10:42.520]  people in mexico saying my people you better do this
[02:10:42.520 --> 02:10:46.360]  uh telling us what to do in america and to the point of hispanic students

[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:56.040]  to the people that see themselves as mexican citizens so much
[02:10:56.040 --> 02:10:59.640]  you know 200 miles from the border that they become enraged and all over the
[02:10:59.640 --> 02:11:03.000]  country illegals every time they have big rallies pulling down american flags at
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:06.920]  post offices and police stations and at businesses while the cops sit there
[02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:12.760]  sucking their thumbs so we're going to discuss all of this today
[02:11:12.760 --> 02:11:17.000]  by the way uh speaking of san antonio express news give me a document cam
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.160]  shot of this please boys uh texas film incentives
[02:11:21.160 --> 02:11:25.560]  mainly are benefiting austin dalis and this is from
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:31.320]  last year this is from 11 2809 or in november of last year and it has the
[02:11:31.320 --> 02:11:34.760]  head of the texas film commission this is run by perry but the head of the
[02:11:34.760 --> 02:11:38.040]  commission itself saying we are funding machete
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:41.400]  now we call the film commission this this this race war film
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:44.360]  last thursday before we published our articles in the washington post
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:49.800]  drudge and other publications we got three million uh friday saturday and
[02:11:49.800 --> 02:11:53.400]  sunday three million additional readers from that one story
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:58.120]  three million uh very very exciting uh on that and that's not counting all the
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:02.360]  thousands of sites that copied our story and the headline was racist film
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:08.440]  machete funded in part with taxpayer funds the governor's press secretary
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:12.680]  then called and wrote to us and said well it is in the queue to be funded we
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:16.280]  haven't funded it yet i then pulled up that the way it works is they agreed
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:19.400]  of funding at the beginning after they've seen the script and then there's a
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:23.160]  final review so they that's a lie from rick perry
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:26.600]  and i tell you it's too bad they're in a better candidate against him i wish
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:31.000]  medina would have won uh but uh he is a patriot in name only
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:34.920]  but it says in this article texas film incentives are mainly benefiting austin
[02:12:34.920 --> 02:12:37.800]  dallis and have other articles that say the same thing austin was also the
[02:12:37.800 --> 02:12:39.560]  side of the production of the rodriguez
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:42.920]  directed movie machete the project was announced shortly after the film
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:46.520]  incentives were created and higgins said the announcement was symbolic for the
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:50.840]  incentive program and that's the higgins uh are
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:54.280]  huggins excuse me is the head of it rodriguez is austin based production
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:57.000]  company trolemaker studios is also filming the movie predators
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:00.360]  continuation of the series predator films in austin then we have another one
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:04.280]  here out of slacker wood reporting that machete is being funded
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:11.880]  by the film commission so caught lying uh and we did add the governor's
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:16.200]  statement in our article that he sent us and we need to do another article
[02:13:16.200 --> 02:13:19.480]  exposing the fact that there's a cover-up you know rodriguez has his free
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:23.640]  speech to make this film he has his free speech to make this film
[02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:29.080]  but you can't then use our tax money for it i mean can the clan get some tax
[02:13:29.080 --> 02:13:31.400]  money for a movie i'm totally against that
[02:13:31.400 --> 02:13:34.280]  make whatever racist crap you want kuklux klan
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:37.240]  but do not take my money to do it just like i don't want to pay for abortions
[02:13:37.240 --> 02:13:41.240]  with my tax money let's go to william geene of alipak i've thrown out some
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:44.040]  of the issues we're going to discuss good to have you here with us sir
[02:13:44.040 --> 02:13:47.480]  hey alex and i want to thank you again for your coverage on that lindsey
[02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:51.080]  graham situation you know after going through a ring of fire on that
[02:13:51.080 --> 02:13:54.840]  um you know coming on your show i got such a great great response from people
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:59.080]  that uh understood what had happened there uh understood the heat that i took
[02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:02.280]  and understood that you know i'm the guy that hit lindsey graham and he backed
[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:05.720]  away from obama and napolitano giving everybody a little more time right now
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:09.880]  so um i really appreciate that and i also want to thank you for being so on the
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:14.680]  market on the money about this movie machete um i know you get a lot of
[02:14:14.680 --> 02:14:18.360]  emails and communications like i do and i know a lot of people waking up a lot of
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:20.760]  people are taking action a lot of people very focused
[02:14:20.760 --> 02:14:25.080]  but it also seems to me also there's a almost like a panic out there you know
[02:14:25.080 --> 02:14:28.280]  like there's so many things that are hitting the public at once now and
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:31.640]  there are a lot of you know confusion and people almost like a some type of
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:34.600]  state of panic and when you look at something like machete
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:38.760]  you know your job and my job at alipak uh has been bringing people information
[02:14:38.760 --> 02:14:41.240]  that a lot of times they really they don't want to hear it
[02:14:41.240 --> 02:14:45.880]  they won't don't want to deal with it um they feel powerless about dealing with
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:48.200]  it and looking at machete knowing what you know
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:51.320]  about illegal immigration of people behind and me looking at the trailer
[02:14:51.320 --> 02:14:54.520]  knowing what i know about the inner workings behind it
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:58.600]  i saw it and i told people i said look you know i see a lot of horrific stuff
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:02.440]  involving the shetty maskers the capitated bodies gang rapes last
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:07.320]  murder uh destruction of nations and then it takes a lot to get my breath it
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:09.960]  takes a lot these days to get my blood pressure up
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:13.560]  when i saw that trailer and i knew what it meant
[02:15:13.560 --> 02:15:17.320]  i knew that if that movie is like the trailer was created
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:21.080]  as it was you know created in the uh for the release on may 1st
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:24.360]  with the message to arizona i was like people are going to die
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:29.160]  over this film people will die because of this film and uh
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:31.880]  you know it was everything i could do to fight their urge to send out a
[02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:35.800]  national press release you know encouraging all americans to take all
[02:15:35.800 --> 02:15:40.040]  reasonable uh steps to protect themselves and their
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:43.000]  family well let me fill you in i don't know if you've seen part two
[02:15:43.000 --> 02:15:47.240]  we did but after i was contacted by his spanish members of his crew
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:51.480]  i then received the script and this is directly from his manager's office his
[02:15:51.480 --> 02:15:54.040]  manager didn't give it to me but it's marked you know it's his manager's
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:58.200]  office copy it's the official script it's worse than the trailer
[02:15:58.200 --> 02:16:01.240]  it's worse than the trailer have you seen that video
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:04.520]  i've seen the trailer video but i haven't seen the script i saw some mention
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:07.640]  of it but i apologize with the rush of information i don't know i understand
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:10.200]  you're busy well let me just fill you in then while we're here
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:15.320]  great uh the video that's got about 210 000 views right now
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:20.440]  uh i show the script highlighted it starts with minute men killing hispanics
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:24.600]  who are then crucified as christ minute men then murdering catholic priests
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:27.800]  torturing them to death burning down catholic churches
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:31.560]  which is meant to invoke you know good conservative hispanics to become angry
[02:16:31.560 --> 02:16:35.320]  it shows uh minute men trying to kill hispanic children
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:39.880]  all the white people are racist scum attempted assassinations of leaders
[02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:43.720]  uh and and then machete becomes above christ and mary
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:48.360]  and is worshiped at the end as god and it turns out he's the
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:53.400]  hero machete cortez in the spy kids movies so he's already a kid hero that
[02:16:53.400 --> 02:16:55.480]  that was pointed out to me and i wouldn't watch the films
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:58.680]  it's true so it's a children character people were watching 10 years ago when
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:02.200]  the first spy kids came out now they're adults so their childhood hero
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:05.160]  is now killing the evil racist gringo who deserves to die
[02:17:05.160 --> 02:17:10.280]  and it's got race war battles i mean it is incredible
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:14.760]  well you know it's it's the next step it's the next encroachment it's the
[02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:19.480]  next level you know they're prodding the fat and aging america
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:23.400]  they're prodding the people that are sick and fat and aging and confused and
[02:17:23.400 --> 02:17:26.920]  you know you know pacified and they're just saying
[02:17:26.920 --> 02:17:30.680]  here we are and here we are and here we are and after seeing that video
[02:17:30.680 --> 02:17:34.920]  it i'm absolutely convinced that that's all that's coming to everybody's door
[02:17:34.920 --> 02:17:40.920]  eventually it's coming to and through the door now me i'm a peaceful political
[02:17:40.920 --> 02:17:43.560]  guy who's running out of time here the good news you've already mentioned the
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:45.720]  good news the good news is you know i've stormed all
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:48.840]  across the country saying revolution now revolution now america
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:52.760]  you've got to stand up you got to get involved and it's not just getting out
[02:17:52.760 --> 02:17:55.560]  in the streets with the tea parties and just standing in the streets
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:17:58.760]  you've got everybody has got to do what the people
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:03.160]  in utah are trying to do what some of the people in pennsylvania and
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:06.040]  arizona are trying to do all across this country
[02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:09.960]  get involved with every single federal and state
[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:13.160]  campaign and election you can right now i don't care if you've never
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:15.880]  worked on a campaign before your life and you don't know what you're doing just
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:20.040]  pick up the phone and start that's all you've got to do is pick up that phone
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:23.400]  and start because we really do have a chance
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:25.800]  to turn things around here before november but look at when they're
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:28.920]  planning on putting that movie out like anytime there's a new movie like that at
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:31.240]  state can be moved around but my understanding is they're targeting
[02:18:31.240 --> 02:18:34.200]  september right before the elections correct yeah no they're saying it's a
[02:18:34.200 --> 02:18:38.360]  political message and it's september third and look at how
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:41.240]  she was the runner-up they now admit she would have won
[02:18:41.240 --> 02:18:46.200]  the judge a la rica conquista guy for miss usa voted against her because she
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:49.640]  said i support states rights that's how militant
[02:18:49.640 --> 02:18:53.000]  these groups are you're not going to wear an american flag in school
[02:18:53.000 --> 02:18:56.600]  and you're not going to say you're for states rights or you're going to pay
[02:18:56.600 --> 02:18:59.960]  you're going to pay and and the movie machete
[02:18:59.960 --> 02:19:03.240]  sends the message that if we don't get our way politically
[02:19:03.240 --> 02:19:06.360]  you're going to pay all the way you're going to pay with your lives
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:09.880]  you're going to pay with your destruction you're going to pay
[02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:13.080]  with in a way that americans have never paid before
[02:19:13.080 --> 02:19:17.000]  because when you picture something like the movie machete
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.840]  12 plus million and there's also some other books we even saw a book on this
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:24.520]  there's other reinforcing factors communications are being sent not just
[02:19:24.520 --> 02:19:27.800]  with this movie but other channels through books and radio broadcast
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:31.720]  all priming these illegals in our midst for this possible
[02:19:31.720 --> 02:19:36.280]  um burning of rome from within stay there william
[02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:40.280]  because in the script it says they rise up with their
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:45.000]  with their tools of their trade you know with their pickaxes
[02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:47.880]  that was written two years ago in the script now it's a movie they've
[02:19:47.880 --> 02:19:50.120]  completed it and then you have the woman saying i'm
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:53.880]  going to rise up with my pickaxes i'm going to kill you
[02:19:53.880 --> 02:20:01.160]  this is pre-programming going on everywhere stay there
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:04.680]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[02:20:04.680 --> 02:20:08.040]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:11.400]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[02:20:11.400 --> 02:20:14.680]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[02:20:14.680 --> 02:20:17.960]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[02:20:17.960 --> 02:20:20.760]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:23.880]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:27.400]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:34.360]  and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified in

[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:09.080]  millions of people south of the border saying this is our country get out
[02:25:09.080 --> 02:25:14.360]  don't wear american flags shut up uh... and and now rodriguez is going to make a
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:18.840]  whole string of films creating this cult icon guy
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:22.920]  uh... it's just it's just horrible william geene of alley pack
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:26.200]  so much is happening but again the good news is
[02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:30.040]  the american people are awake hispanic americans are awake and they're saying
[02:25:30.040 --> 02:25:33.160]  look i choose america i choose the republic
[02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:39.000]  i'm not going to be intimidated into racial politics
[02:25:39.000 --> 02:25:42.840]  your comments on that william well i think you're right about waking up look
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:46.200]  at some of the things that hit their consciousness recently that ron gochia
[02:25:46.200 --> 02:25:50.680]  speech that we released the valley pack back in early 2008 someone grabbed a
[02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:53.880]  copy of it and thank goodness drugs report linked
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:57.560]  into the new copy and once that happened it went right up the flagpole
[02:25:57.560 --> 02:26:01.240]  mentioned on fox and everything and had hundreds of thousands of views and the
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:05.320]  whole country's watching this uh instructor from california stand there
[02:26:05.320 --> 02:26:08.520]  and tell his student minions that they're part of the
[02:26:08.520 --> 02:26:14.200]  uh... global hispanic front inside of america the revolutionary front
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:19.480]  you know their soldiers and so because he was speaking in english and because
[02:26:19.480 --> 02:26:22.920]  the timing was right and the right communications tapped in there
[02:26:22.920 --> 02:26:27.800]  america got a little glimpse of the uh... lethal and revolutionary zeal
[02:26:27.800 --> 02:26:32.120]  uh... and testing the illegal immigration population you know we've
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:34.600]  tried to point out those of us that have been steeped in it
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:39.720]  illegal immigration is no longer just a political tool it's a form
[02:26:39.720 --> 02:26:43.400]  of warfare against this country and it's being
[02:26:43.400 --> 02:26:48.120]  conducted made entirely possible by uh... the fact that the american public
[02:26:48.120 --> 02:26:51.960]  that we've been compromised at the top the top control mechanisms of the
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:55.720]  corporation groups and and and and government out of dc has been
[02:26:55.720 --> 02:26:59.240]  compromised by our enemies and now they're pumping in enough people that
[02:26:59.240 --> 02:27:03.320]  hate our guts to deal with us uh... in on the inside of our own country
[02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:06.360]  that's what's going on here i truly believe that i wish that wasn't the
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:08.520]  case i wish it wasn't my job to tell people that
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:11.960]  well now that's the facts and that's what globalization is is playing ribs
[02:27:11.960 --> 02:27:15.480]  off against each other and and look at how the peanut
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:18.760]  uh... you know information look at the mike report the homeland security
[02:27:18.760 --> 02:27:21.320]  report the adl southern property law center reports
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:26.040]  they demonize everybody in there they say the tea parties are violent and want
[02:27:26.040 --> 02:27:29.640]  to overthrow america when we want to save america we're not doing anything
[02:27:29.640 --> 02:27:32.920]  violent you've got union thugs attacking tea party people
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:36.680]  the national media covers that up meanwhile you've got all over spanish
[02:27:36.680 --> 02:27:40.840]  radio all over spanish tv but in spanish the same stuff we heard
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:45.240]  uh... go chest say uh... so what's happening is the public is now finding
[02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:49.240]  out what's really going on well i've been telling people look
[02:27:49.240 --> 02:27:52.520]  don't look for your savior uh... with man
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:56.440]  and don't look for your leaders on television
[02:27:56.440 --> 02:28:00.440]  you're not going to find your leaders for this mess
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:03.160]  on television and part of the problem we're having here too
[02:28:03.160 --> 02:28:06.360]  you know there are racist groups in america and and sometimes like i've
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:09.800]  had some recent dealings with an event we're trying to put on put on some
[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:14.600]  events down in arizona and it's hard to tell sometimes
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:19.080]  whether these people who try to paint a big racist target on good people you
[02:28:19.080 --> 02:28:22.920]  know the tea parties ninety nine point five plus percent of them are all
[02:28:22.920 --> 02:28:26.440]  non-extreme people but then these people try to get in the middle of it
[02:28:26.440 --> 02:28:30.280]  paint a target on them and sometimes but it looks like they're real racist and
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:34.920]  sometimes it's like who's really paying these people for this who is really
[02:28:34.920 --> 02:28:40.680]  behind this because i am seeing a pattern of
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:45.160]  people that either are racist or are pretending to be racist like skinheads
[02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:48.360]  and neo-nazis and stuff be lining up for people like
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:53.160]  sheriff joe arpaio and uh... russell pierce and tady hayward down in arizona
[02:28:53.160 --> 02:28:55.800]  these folks are trying to get in the picture with them like you know jump in
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:59.560]  front of the car and take a picture as if they posed with them and
[02:28:59.560 --> 02:29:01.800]  and all this other stuff and it's really hard to tell
[02:29:01.800 --> 02:29:04.120]  well let me stop you let me give you some intel
[02:29:04.120 --> 02:29:08.120]  it broke even on the drudge report a month ago it was in the associated press
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:12.840]  ap that democratic operatives all over the country
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:15.880]  said we're going to go out with racist signs at tea parties
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:20.120]  to make them look racist and we've caught white supremacist leaders
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:24.440]  being coming out that they were feds and so let's talk about that when we
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:27.560]  come back because uh... actually sir
[02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:31.720]  they've been caught doing this so your instinct was absolutely right
[02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:34.360]  well i wanted to mention the name real quick talk radio guy that we had to
[02:29:34.360 --> 02:29:36.600]  keep pulling stuff over website named howl turner
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:39.560]  who was constantly putting out stuff about the north american union
[02:29:39.560 --> 02:29:43.000]  the euro uh... and this other stuff and this stuff turned out being you know
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.760]  crud it was like legitimate looking on the surface but then we come to find out
[02:29:46.760 --> 02:29:51.320]  that after he was arrested this guy was on the fb i payroll yeah stay there
[02:29:51.320 --> 02:29:55.240]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:55.240 --> 02:30:00.760]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:30:36.200 --> 02:30:39.320]  need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial

[02:33:18.280 --> 02:33:21.560]  baby's great-grandson folks i'm somebody was brought up to be colorblind
[02:33:21.560 --> 02:33:25.480]  broden dallas very diverse area and then in college
[02:33:25.480 --> 02:33:29.880]  i was told america was bad they had to cancel the texas independent state
[02:33:29.880 --> 02:33:33.160]  rally at ut pro texas isn't even allowed to have nothing to do with
[02:33:33.160 --> 02:33:36.520]  the border and then i learned about the planet
[02:33:36.520 --> 02:33:40.040]  san diego and matcha and la raza and azzed line
[02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:44.680]  and i've literally saw the mayor of austin gus garcy at the time
[02:33:44.680 --> 02:33:48.040]  have a proclamation where he said hispanics are a god race descended from
[02:33:48.040 --> 02:33:51.000]  aliens i couldn't find that video last week but steve
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:53.960]  mason's actually bringing in today so we should have it tomorrow
[02:33:53.960 --> 02:33:58.280]  i mean bizarre stuff and we we should criticize the clan
[02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:02.200]  when they're trying to radicalize and get white people to be racist but we
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:05.880]  but there's not 30 million clan members and there are 30 million
[02:34:05.880 --> 02:34:10.440]  illegals in this country uh and we need to really point out this is dangerous
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:15.320]  and this is and when fox studios 20th century fox is funding a film like
[02:34:15.320 --> 02:34:19.640]  machete we've got a big problem uh here and so
[02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:21.400]  we need to get this out in the open now
[02:34:21.400 --> 02:34:24.680]  william geene of alley pack dot us is our guest
[02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:27.480]  and i've been ranting and raving but i wanted him to be able to go over
[02:34:27.480 --> 02:34:30.600]  other issues he wanted to cover things that he thinks is important before we
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:34.280]  go to calls and then also i wanted to go over mexican pirates attack
[02:34:34.280 --> 02:34:36.920]  american fishermen san antonio express news but
[02:34:36.920 --> 02:34:39.560]  uh william you've got the floor for other key info people need to be made
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:42.520]  aware of well one of the things that we've been doing and we've been doing
[02:34:42.520 --> 02:34:46.600]  all along alex is that we've been asking hispanic and black americans to
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:50.840]  unify with white and asian americans to against this threat from illegal
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:53.400]  immigration and at the same time while we're telling
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:56.280]  more radical elements in the white community that appear here and there to
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:35:00.120]  stay back and not um target people based on race
[02:35:00.120 --> 02:35:03.080]  we've got to ask blacks and hispanics to do the same thing
[02:35:03.080 --> 02:35:06.360]  they've got the exact same thing going on except it's being tolerated and it's
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:08.920]  not being suppressed like it is in the white community now
[02:35:08.920 --> 02:35:13.080]  some of the white hate groups or neo-nazi groups and whatnot
[02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:17.640]  they believe that moderates uh and middle of the moderate people in america
[02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:21.560]  you know we're out of time basically they know the history on this thing from
[02:35:21.560 --> 02:35:26.200]  the vimar republic where it ends up with uh their people versus the
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:30.360]  communists in the streets and they don't mind going there alex they
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:33.880]  they don't mind going back to that because they know how um it often pans
[02:35:33.880 --> 02:35:36.840]  out when that's them versus the communists in the streets
[02:35:36.840 --> 02:35:41.160]  so we're trying to keep it from going there and forward to not go there
[02:35:41.160 --> 02:35:44.120]  people like me and others that are concerned about illegal
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:47.800]  immigration need to watch our affiliations do the very best we can to
[02:35:47.800 --> 02:35:52.280]  keep uh people who are are being racist out of the uh political
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:56.440]  debate and we need the help of black and hispanic leaders i've said it a hundred
[02:35:56.440 --> 02:35:59.960]  times and the of course the smear groups will never give me credit for it i've
[02:35:59.960 --> 02:36:04.120]  said that you know my goal is to unify and this is what i think they fear the most
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:07.800]  unify the 80 percent of americans that keep showing up in these polls that feel
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:11.480]  a certain way they don't want us to unify that's right america is an 80
[02:36:11.480 --> 02:36:15.320]  percent uh white uh it's it's roughly 50 percent
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:19.320]  so what's that other 30 percent that's hispanics and blacks and asians
[02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:22.280]  they want private property they want the second amendment they don't want to
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:25.320]  live in the third world well the way we see it
[02:36:25.320 --> 02:36:28.840]  over 80 percent of white americans want the border security legal immigration
[02:36:28.840 --> 02:36:32.840]  reversed over 65 percent of black americans feel the same way
[02:36:32.840 --> 02:36:36.200]  and somewhere between 54 56 percent of america's
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:39.160]  legal hispanics feel that way now unfortunately
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:42.680]  over half the hispanics in the country right now are here illegally so that
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:47.320]  reduces the hispanics that are with americans down to under 30 percent
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:51.320]  but overall 80 percent of americans especially if you take the illegal
[02:36:51.320 --> 02:36:54.760]  aims out of the polling data um want the border secured
[02:36:54.760 --> 02:36:58.840]  our existing laws of force no benefits for illegals employer's fine and illegal
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:03.000]  aims to go home yeah i've seen gallant polls of 79 percent of hispanics
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:07.800]  want more border security so i guess um that must be a poll of people that are
[02:37:07.800 --> 02:37:11.400]  citizens well i'm not sure we're very um
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:15.000]  guarded about gallup we've seen gallup come out with some readings that are
[02:37:15.000 --> 02:37:19.960]  very far off from the other poll medians on on readings like this but
[02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:23.480]  what i'm trying to say is the elites that are responsible
[02:37:23.480 --> 02:37:27.480]  for what's happening here in the country do not want william guine alex jones or
[02:37:27.480 --> 02:37:31.880]  anybody else to unify the public against them and so
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:36.280]  that's why the racial canards are being thrown out left and right
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:39.640]  to try to keep that from happening that is their game that's how they play it and
[02:37:39.640 --> 02:37:42.040]  if there's no racism to be found on a group or
[02:37:42.040 --> 02:37:45.320]  individual they'll either make it up or try to send somebody in to label them
[02:37:45.320 --> 02:37:47.480]  like that which is what we're talking about
[02:37:47.480 --> 02:37:50.680]  um before the end of the last break even that uh you know one of the biggest
[02:37:50.680 --> 02:37:53.320]  racist that had a radio station in the country
[02:37:53.320 --> 02:37:56.920]  last year when he was finally arrested uh in court it turned out he was on the
[02:37:56.920 --> 02:38:00.440]  fbi payroll and they had all the emails where he's
[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:03.720]  the feds are going good job bring them out you know
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:06.520]  you make them look extreme he's like don't worry i'm getting you know i'm
[02:38:06.520 --> 02:38:09.960]  getting them for you and it turned out he was the highest level
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:14.040]  uh fbi agent but then that looks like it's classified
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:17.800]  then they said asset but at national security level
[02:38:17.800 --> 02:38:21.960]  it was above counterterrorism he went right after the north american union and
[02:38:21.960 --> 02:38:24.760]  kept floating bogus claims i know a lot of people they're listening probably
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:28.520]  saw in the emails claiming that uh that he had
[02:38:28.520 --> 02:38:32.600]  documentation of the amaro uh the new currency for america and then a certain
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:36.440]  number of ameros and gold had been shipped to china and he had evidence of it
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:40.360]  you know over over at alley pack dot us the largest archive of information on
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:43.400]  these topics you know we tell people to keep um
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:46.840]  you know grain of salt handy but we do our very best especially when we see
[02:38:46.840 --> 02:38:51.400]  something going viral on the web to analyze it and to rate its credibility
[02:38:51.400 --> 02:38:54.120]  level and we kept looking at this stuff coming out of this how turner guy
[02:38:54.120 --> 02:38:57.160]  because it was all no exactly he would say computers found with a
[02:38:57.160 --> 02:39:01.960]  trackership uh instead of covering all the real admissions of tracking and
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:05.160]  then it would be discredited or he said i got this from the mint
[02:39:05.160 --> 02:39:08.680]  when it was a joke coin we pointed out the mint in
[02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:13.720]  uh colorado that actually made it as an anti uh north american union so instead
[02:39:13.720 --> 02:39:16.840]  of looking at all the real sbp documents the judicial watch got
[02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:20.040]  instead of looking all the facts that i was covering you were covering that
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:26.040]  lu dobbs was covering instead the media could say look at this amaro coin hoax
[02:39:26.040 --> 02:39:29.480]  disinformation uh how turner who was on the payroll of the federal bureau
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:33.800]  investigation broadcasting racial hatred and racial animosity
[02:39:33.800 --> 02:39:37.080]  was also broadcasting disinformation about illegal immigration in the north
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:40.760]  american union and one car he was putting it out intentionally he had
[02:39:40.760 --> 02:39:43.080]  masters and handlers that were paying him to do it
[02:39:43.080 --> 02:39:49.560]  and so um you know we know um we know that there's a game afoot here um i
[02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:52.920]  just think that the problem we're having right now alex is getting
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:57.400]  some of these agents are all around uh the immigration enforcement movement
[02:39:57.400 --> 02:40:01.080]  they're on the inside they're all around and on the inside of the team party
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:05.400]  movement they have you know infiltrated and we've got to do something
[02:40:05.400 --> 02:40:09.240]  we have got to do something alex to get the true blue people
[02:40:09.240 --> 02:40:13.560]  here together and soon to strengthen and improve
[02:40:13.560 --> 02:40:17.160]  communication and cooperation in a way that cannot be
[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:20.680]  derailed by the infiltrators and the crazies well you know the best way to
[02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:25.080]  deal with it is to call it out when you see it but to all and to follow the
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:28.120]  people to their car get their license number you'll you'll then discover
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:30.920]  they're a fed or they're working for the southern prairie law center
[02:40:30.920 --> 02:40:36.040]  and that's come out uh but to also just continue to point out the ap article
[02:40:36.040 --> 02:40:39.000]  where these democratic operatives in all 50 states
[02:40:39.000 --> 02:40:43.160]  organized and did go out and it was also in in new mexico news
[02:40:43.160 --> 02:40:46.520]  they even admitted to the news they would dress up like nazis with racist
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:49.800]  signs and they even admitted they were doing it so
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:53.320]  as long as we explain to the public that most of this is provocateur
[02:40:53.320 --> 02:40:57.080]  uh i think that's the most important message well we're gonna
[02:40:57.080 --> 02:41:00.440]  basically the tea parties have been important and strong over this point
[02:41:00.440 --> 02:41:04.840]  but we're going to basically steer people away from the rally
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:08.200]  thing into the campaigns and elections because
[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:11.720]  we don't we for one we feel that is the number one place that the public can
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:14.680]  make the difference that it needs to make yeah we need to have tea parties
[02:41:14.680 --> 02:41:18.520]  inside the state house and hearings inside the county commissioner's court
[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:22.120]  inside the city council not just dissipating all of our energy
[02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:26.280]  standing around the street well each campaign for public office is active
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:29.880]  right now is a mini organization in itself that
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:34.120]  needs money and people and the candidates i don't think that the feds
[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:38.040]  and the the democrats and others have a lot of
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:41.720]  agent provocateurs that are posing as candidates right now and it's too late
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:45.800]  for them to create them uh they do they are able to to get activists out there
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:48.920]  people at events and events are the most vulnerable
[02:41:48.920 --> 02:41:53.080]  things that there are um but you know basically these people are highly
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:57.240]  sophisticated liars 99% of what i'm having to deal with
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:00.280]  and what the american public is having to deal with right now i think could be
[02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:04.280]  described in two words sophisticated liars
[02:42:05.160 --> 02:42:09.000]  well said my friend other points you want to get out there to the public
[02:42:09.000 --> 02:42:13.800]  uh let's talk about mexico being a failed state and collapsing
[02:42:13.800 --> 02:42:18.040]  and the acceleration of crime and murder especially racial murder
[02:42:18.040 --> 02:42:24.280]  including piracy now in places in texas bordering mexico
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:28.600]  well you know i've just recently heard about some of the um the piracy
[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:31.560]  you know some of the piracy i would describe as illegal immigration itself
[02:42:31.560 --> 02:42:35.880]  as a form of piracy of the uh american citizenry in
[02:42:35.880 --> 02:42:39.960]  many ways um mexico you know the death count
[02:42:39.960 --> 02:42:43.480]  the and the situation there i i'll tell you a story
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:47.320]  that i think you'll appreciate alex i got a guy that pops on my website every
[02:42:47.320 --> 02:42:51.720]  now and says he's a uh young man in mexico who likes video games
[02:42:51.720 --> 02:42:55.480]  but is sympathetic to our calls or so he says but he always sends me
[02:42:55.480 --> 02:43:00.440]  pictures and images and things about how the club he was near got shot up by the
[02:43:00.440 --> 02:43:03.480]  mexican gangs the other night with blah blah people killed
[02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:06.680]  so it's really hard for me to tell where this guy's coming from but he sent me a
[02:43:06.680 --> 02:43:11.080]  message last week of a los zetas commando raid
[02:43:11.080 --> 02:43:16.600]  on a villa in mexico where five to fifteen cars rolled into this
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:19.560]  little town at five thirty a.m. apparently government or the
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:25.000]  federales had some um digital cameras set up that documented all this and they
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:28.600]  got out and they blocked the roads and secured the access in a paramilitary
[02:43:28.600 --> 02:43:31.240]  fashion with their scheme ask and their assault rifles
[02:43:31.240 --> 02:43:35.400]  all converged on a villa of some drug lord or something and started firing
[02:43:35.400 --> 02:43:38.280]  through the windows or whatever and he wanted to know
[02:43:38.280 --> 02:43:42.200]  what i thought of the tactics of law status
[02:43:42.200 --> 02:43:45.640]  and i said the tactics of law status are horrible and what you see here in this
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:49.160]  film is horrific however what you see here in this film
[02:43:49.160 --> 02:43:54.280]  could not happen in over half of america because there are more armed men with
[02:43:54.280 --> 02:43:57.960]  more firepower than you see in this video within a one mile radius of my
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:01.080]  house due to a thing called the second amendment
[02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:04.120]  and if that type of thing happened in most a lot of neighborhoods around
[02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:08.120]  america at five thirty in the morning after the first gunfire went off a lot
[02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:11.080]  of people would open their windows and handle it from their bedrooms
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:13.960]  that's what makes me i see where you're going with this this is the way they
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:17.800]  threaten you i get the same stuff what do you think of this
[02:44:17.800 --> 02:44:21.880]  what do you think of them how will kill you oh are you concerned about that as a
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:25.000]  form of intimidation but thank you but thank you
[02:44:25.000 --> 02:44:29.560]  so that's what it is a threat it is but it's also my my response is that because
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:33.080]  i live in the united states and because i'm a free america with first and
[02:44:33.080 --> 02:44:36.840]  second amendment rights that if they came into my neighborhood
[02:44:36.840 --> 02:44:39.960]  or most still over half the neighborhoods in america
[02:44:39.960 --> 02:44:44.600]  and tried that they wouldn't get out scott free you're not gonna or they
[02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:46.920]  wouldn't get away with it more than once you know the
[02:44:46.920 --> 02:44:51.000]  citizenry of america is armed and we are arming ourselves in greater
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:54.840]  capacities every day especially after watching trailers for films like
[02:44:54.840 --> 02:44:59.480]  machete and therefore we the people of the
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:04.280]  united states are empowered in mexico the government has guns
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:08.600]  the gangs have guns the people have none and so they are a perpetual victims
[02:45:08.600 --> 02:45:11.000]  and what do you think of the mexican president we're going to play this clip
[02:45:11.000 --> 02:45:14.360]  in a moment coming out and talking about
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:17.880]  his people in america his people and how they're being abused
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:24.440]  this is a foreign power openly in the u.s telling us what to do in our country
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:29.240]  what's your take on that well i think that we should uh every time he tries to
[02:45:29.240 --> 02:45:33.080]  step in the white house he should be presented with a bill
[02:45:33.080 --> 02:45:36.600]  for his people in our country an estimated bill
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:40.920]  and each time he comes back he should be handed the increased total bill
[02:45:40.920 --> 02:45:44.280]  and explain that he's not going to be allowed allowed in the united states or
[02:45:44.280 --> 02:45:46.680]  in the white house or any other government institution
[02:45:46.680 --> 02:45:50.520]  much less a couple years ago alex he didn't even bother with stopping
[02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:54.200]  by the white house he broke with diplomatic decorum and just entered the
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:58.600]  united states and traveled around the southwest talking to his people so i
[02:45:58.600 --> 02:46:02.760]  guess we're sort of better off that he actually uh stuck with a diplomatic
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:05.800]  protocol this time as the head of state and went to the white house
[02:46:05.800 --> 02:46:09.640]  instead of just walking into our country and going around talking to his people
[02:46:09.640 --> 02:46:13.240]  on his own i think that he should be presented with a bill
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:17.960]  or the cost of his people just imagine if say there were 30 million french in
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:20.600]  germany and the french president went to
[02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:24.040]  germany and told the german government what to do and told the 30 million
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:27.320]  french to manipulate the political process in that country
[02:46:27.320 --> 02:46:31.000]  that is an act of war that is an act of subterfuge that is an act
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:37.320]  of military overthrow of conquest of infasora a law infasora
[02:46:37.320 --> 02:46:40.680]  and no other country would put up with this but because the globalist want
[02:46:40.680 --> 02:46:44.520]  this it is allowed in our media doesn't point out
[02:46:44.520 --> 02:46:47.720]  how outrageous this is let's go ahead and play a clip
[02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:52.920]  from the news covering this information for his part the mexican president said
[02:46:52.920 --> 02:46:56.200]  some things that were a bit more restrained than what he said in his own
[02:46:56.200 --> 02:47:00.360]  country which he called the arizona law which is not yet to go into effect
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:03.240]  an opening to hate and discrimination in that state
[02:47:03.240 --> 02:47:09.000]  here's what he said about arizona's immigration law on the south lawn
[02:47:09.000 --> 02:47:13.080]  we can't do so with a community that will promote
[02:47:13.080 --> 02:47:17.000]  a dignified life in an orderly way for both
[02:47:17.000 --> 02:47:21.400]  our countries who are some of them still living
[02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:27.800]  here in the shadows with such laws laws as the arizona law
[02:47:27.800 --> 02:47:33.400]  that is placing our people to face discrimination
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:36.440]  face discrimination in arizona it's one of the reasons the mexican government
[02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:39.880]  has issued a travel warning any mexicans who may travel to arizona
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:44.120]  even though as i said the law has yet and now you've got these seditious boycotts
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:49.880]  by the city of austin and listen i do tell people even though i
[02:47:49.880 --> 02:47:53.560]  live here boycott austin because they're boycotting
[02:47:53.560 --> 02:47:56.760]  and you should call the austin city council if you live in texas or other
[02:47:56.760 --> 02:48:00.840]  areas and say we're going to boycott you until you stop boycotting arizona
[02:48:00.840 --> 02:48:04.280]  and california is doing this we're talking about not buying power
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:08.760]  from arizona because the elites want to bust this country open while i have
[02:48:08.760 --> 02:48:12.280]  william gene with us for this segment the next maybe five minutes in the next
[02:48:12.280 --> 02:48:15.240]  hour if he can do it i want to take a few calls
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:19.160]  i'm sure mr gene already knows this because he's
[02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:22.120]  he's so well researched but what i've discovered living in austin and in other
[02:48:22.120 --> 02:48:26.520]  articles around the country uh city council members brothers in the
[02:48:26.520 --> 02:48:29.960]  past and others the la rica conquista leaders in my
[02:48:29.960 --> 02:48:33.080]  town have been busted in the past one of them
[02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:35.800]  was caught beating within an inch of their life
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:39.880]  some people they've smuggled in as a coyote who hadn't paid all their cash
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:43.320]  others have been caught running whores in others have been caught
[02:48:43.320 --> 02:48:47.560]  running drugs in uh and so really this is just the mexican mafia
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:52.520]  el jeffes who are here just over their people they don't want them speaking
[02:48:52.520 --> 02:48:55.480]  english they don't want them getting the second amendment they want to keep them
[02:48:55.480 --> 02:48:58.600]  as slaves like they do in mexico and a lot of
[02:48:58.600 --> 02:49:01.640]  these la rica conquista leaders are just mafia criminals
[02:49:01.640 --> 02:49:06.200]  who are in political office well i think you're absolutely right one of
[02:49:06.200 --> 02:49:09.880]  things uh you know here we have the president of a failed state
[02:49:09.880 --> 02:49:13.080]  trying to tell us how to run our business but i gotta tell you i hope he will
[02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:17.240]  keep issuing advisories for mexicans and mexican to stay out of arizona
[02:49:17.240 --> 02:49:20.360]  matter of fact at this point till we get this thing settled and our people calm
[02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:23.480]  down and their people calm down i'd like for mexico the mexican
[02:49:23.480 --> 02:49:26.520]  the government to issue travel advisories against anybody coming to the
[02:49:26.520 --> 02:49:29.240]  united states like we're issuing travel advisories
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:33.240]  against anybody going to mexico right now anybody that goes to mexico
[02:49:33.240 --> 02:49:38.680]  for a non-emergency reason is either massively misinformed uninformed or an
[02:49:38.680 --> 02:49:42.280]  idiot and they need to stay out our people need to stay out our dollars
[02:49:42.280 --> 02:49:44.920]  need to stay at home mexico needs to stay out of here
[02:49:44.920 --> 02:49:48.840]  i like the fact they're telling people dot to go to arizona that works just
[02:49:48.840 --> 02:49:52.520]  fine for me and another thing i want to point out alex is that the reason
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:59.560]  that you see so many cities boycotting um uh arizona is because right now the
[02:49:59.560 --> 02:50:02.520]  globalist responsible for this treachery in america
[02:50:02.520 --> 02:50:06.040]  i'm telling everybody all their chips are in all their chips are in the center
[02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:09.800]  of the table right now and their strong points have been these
[02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:15.240]  very liberal uh big money city arenas where it costs a lot of money
[02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:18.840]  you have to be a liberal and you have to have a lot of money to get on the city
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:23.400]  councils to run a place like boston and los angeles and new york so these are
[02:50:23.400 --> 02:50:27.880]  the places where their globalists no boundaries no
[02:50:27.880 --> 02:50:34.440]  borders uh you know uh agenda um it's still strong and so
[02:50:34.440 --> 02:50:37.240]  they're showing every resource they're telling every single resource they've
[02:50:37.240 --> 02:50:40.040]  got stand up and speak out against the arizona because arizona
[02:50:40.040 --> 02:50:43.640]  just a huge monkey wrench in the entire machinery
[02:50:43.640 --> 02:50:47.560]  and texas is moving texas and other states are moving to do the same thing
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:50.760]  so the globalists are panicking they thought they had america dead
[02:50:50.760 --> 02:50:53.960]  they thought they were gonna overrun the country and destroy it but the
[02:50:53.960 --> 02:50:57.000]  giant is rising we'll be right back with william

[02:55:53.560 --> 02:55:57.320]  laundering their money through us banks and now they admit on fox news
[02:55:57.320 --> 02:56:00.760]  and ap that our own troops are being made to grow the opium
[02:56:00.760 --> 02:56:04.040]  so if you're getting lost zetas veiled threats
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:07.640]  that's a threat from the u.s government just so you know well the thing is one
[02:56:07.640 --> 02:56:10.680]  of the only things that there's only a couple things that i think that keep
[02:56:10.680 --> 02:56:16.440]  me safe alex and that is um my um my relationship with god
[02:56:16.440 --> 02:56:23.000]  and my um that's number one and also the fact that so many people
[02:56:23.000 --> 02:56:28.440]  are counting on me on this as um one of the last hopes in this country that
[02:56:28.440 --> 02:56:32.440]  this can all be worked out peacefully and politically um
[02:56:32.440 --> 02:56:36.360]  if something you know awful happens to me you know this is what we talked about
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:38.840]  the last time we're on a show and i and i saw a video i don't know how many people
[02:56:38.840 --> 02:56:43.400]  saw the video at the last time we talked alex i saw a video that you put out
[02:56:43.400 --> 02:56:46.520]  because apparently you and i reached a point in our conversations in front of
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:50.680]  the public like this where we were like you were like look William you know um
[02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:53.560]  you better make it very clear to everybody you're not suicidal not i said
[02:56:53.560 --> 02:56:57.960]  i am not suicidal i am heterosexual i love my family i don't mess with hookers
[02:56:57.960 --> 02:57:02.040]  or heroin uh you know you put out a video
[02:57:02.040 --> 02:57:06.520]  um about that because you know at this point just killing us in enough you
[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:09.560]  know we have to be found with a a needle in our arm
[02:57:09.560 --> 02:57:13.960]  and uh something like that you know um because they want to discredit us
[02:57:13.960 --> 02:57:17.880]  more than anything else and if they can't discredit us you know
[02:57:17.880 --> 02:57:22.280]  the bottom line to it is that if anything untoward happens to me or my family
[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:26.040]  or my friends or anything like that you know i'm one of the last people that
[02:57:26.040 --> 02:57:29.160]  you know a lot of people are hanging in there for you know holding their cells
[02:57:29.160 --> 02:57:32.200]  at bay and staying on the peaceful political process if
[02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:36.920]  if things start happening to me or people like me um in the country then
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:39.880]  what happens next won't be political and it won't be peaceful and i won't be
[02:57:39.880 --> 02:57:42.520]  able to control it and neither will you or anybody else
[02:57:42.520 --> 02:57:45.480]  and it's not gonna end like the movie machete
[02:57:45.480 --> 02:57:48.600]  no because these are americans we're talking about we're talking about
[02:57:48.600 --> 02:57:53.080]  americans that have um you know some of the best people in the world
[02:57:53.080 --> 02:57:57.000]  despite all of our problems despite the loss of morality that has
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:01.960]  decayed this country so badly we i still believe that we have
[02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:07.160]  that uh divine uh essence to us a divine um
[02:58:07.160 --> 02:58:11.560]  reason providence providence that we have that providence
[02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:16.280]  around us that is going to have to come and also i i believe from what i'm seeing
[02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:19.720]  uh you know people like aren't you afraid of them and i said there's only one
[02:58:19.720 --> 02:58:23.800]  you know i fear god and that's the only fear the real only real fear
[02:58:23.800 --> 02:58:27.080]  that i have and i do believe that the hand of god is moving
[02:58:27.080 --> 02:58:32.600]  inside of this country right now um and it's uh it's not all going to be very

[03:08:33.240 --> 03:08:37.560]  and opium dealer because there's a lot more going on there really explains the
[03:08:37.560 --> 03:08:41.400]  system of plausible deniability it explains
[03:08:41.400 --> 03:08:44.760]  how they use pseudonyms kernel john kernel johnny
[03:08:44.760 --> 03:08:48.200]  it also explains how they use lockheed martin of the military
[03:08:48.200 --> 03:08:52.040]  industrial complex so we're going to be getting to that and another huge
[03:08:52.040 --> 03:08:56.280]  huge story we need to talk about i talked about this on my show
[03:08:56.280 --> 03:09:00.360]  over the weekend google over the past several years they're not telling us
[03:09:00.360 --> 03:09:04.280]  how many years it means more than a few okay so more than three
[03:09:04.280 --> 03:09:08.120]  years with google street views where they said hey we're just going to be
[03:09:08.120 --> 03:09:11.480]  taking pictures and mapping out society and it's going to be great for
[03:09:11.480 --> 03:09:15.240]  everybody now if you look at this times online
[03:09:15.240 --> 03:09:19.880]  headline eric schmidt says google should not be prosecuted for wi-fi records
[03:09:19.880 --> 03:09:26.040]  it actually shows you a car with a device mounted on the top now
[03:09:26.040 --> 03:09:31.320]  that's not used to take pictures see photographs are taken from cameras
[03:09:31.320 --> 03:09:35.320]  now they said over the last several years accidentally they were taking
[03:09:35.320 --> 03:09:39.880]  all the wireless information and if you're part of the dumb down masses
[03:09:39.880 --> 03:09:43.800]  and you read the local headlines that were basically in the back of the paper
[03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:46.680]  and not made out to be a big deal you might believe that if you didn't read
[03:09:46.680 --> 03:09:49.320]  three four paragraphs in when you realize hey wait a minute
[03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:53.720]  taking pictures has nothing to do with data mining
[03:09:53.720 --> 03:09:57.080]  all of the information surrounding them
[03:09:57.080 --> 03:10:02.440]  wirelessly and now schmidt is pleading with the international
[03:10:02.440 --> 03:10:07.080]  and american community not to prosecute him the chief executive of google
[03:10:07.080 --> 03:10:10.440]  admitted to major privacy mistakes mistakes please
[03:10:10.440 --> 03:10:13.960]  today as regulators prepare to launch probes into the company for recording
[03:10:13.960 --> 03:10:17.080]  personal communications sent over unsecured wireless networks
[03:10:17.080 --> 03:10:20.600]  in people's homes now eric schmidt is featured
[03:10:20.600 --> 03:10:24.280]  ever so shortly an invisible empire and we're going to play that clip
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:28.360]  briefly coming up not right now but he clearly discusses
[03:10:28.360 --> 03:10:31.720]  how he wants to talk about what's going on in the world where we're going
[03:10:31.720 --> 03:10:35.800]  the new world order as they call it referring to the elitist he works with
[03:10:35.800 --> 03:10:40.040]  he is a very intricate part of the military industrial complex at this
[03:10:40.040 --> 03:10:41.880]  point eric schmidt said that the company
[03:10:41.880 --> 03:10:45.560]  had not authorized the activity of its streetcar views give me a break didn't
[03:10:45.560 --> 03:10:48.840]  authorize it which have been collecting snippets of people's online
[03:10:48.840 --> 03:10:51.880]  activities broadcast over un unprotected home and
[03:10:51.880 --> 03:10:57.080]  business wi-fi networks which depending on the year were about 70 to 80 percent
[03:10:57.080 --> 03:11:01.560]  of the wireless networks out there and this is what he said no harm
[03:11:01.560 --> 03:11:08.040]  no foul hey eric it's not a basketball game brother it's real life
[03:11:08.040 --> 03:11:11.800]  speaking at google's zeitgeist conference at the grove hilton
[03:11:11.800 --> 03:11:15.960]  in a heart for sure mr schmidt said that the greater damage had been done to
[03:11:15.960 --> 03:11:19.560]  the company's reputation rather than to the individuals
[03:11:19.560 --> 03:11:23.880]  themselves and then he said oh it was just a relatively small amount of data
[03:11:23.880 --> 03:11:26.520]  that was collected and it was not authorized
[03:11:26.520 --> 03:11:31.400]  we stopped dry up driving immediately total lie
[03:11:31.400 --> 03:11:35.640]  this just came out this week most of the country has been mapped
[03:11:35.640 --> 03:11:38.920]  with google street views they didn't stop anything
[03:11:38.920 --> 03:11:42.840]  there appears to be no use of data it's sitting on a hard drive
[03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:47.400]  and then he goes on to say we will not delete the collected data until
[03:11:47.400 --> 03:11:53.320]  ordered to do so and again because it's a military industrial complex company
[03:11:53.320 --> 03:11:57.800]  they work with the nsa they're part of a nasa program
[03:11:57.800 --> 03:12:02.920]  out there folks the uk information commissioner's office has said that the
[03:12:02.920 --> 03:12:06.680]  data protection act appeared to have been breached but that after
[03:12:06.680 --> 03:12:09.960]  receiving assurances from google that it would delete the data as soon as
[03:12:09.960 --> 03:12:13.800]  reasonably possible so again they were aware that they were
[03:12:13.800 --> 03:12:16.520]  collecting data the uk information commissioner's
[03:12:16.520 --> 03:12:20.040]  office knew that this wasn't just about street views it was about
[03:12:20.040 --> 03:12:24.440]  maintaining all of this wireless data whether that be your emails your bank
[03:12:24.440 --> 03:12:28.280]  account your passwords the websites you visited all
[03:12:28.280 --> 03:12:33.960]  tracked traced and database on another level with a private company called
[03:12:33.960 --> 03:12:37.720]  google that's the reality and the uk information commissioner's office
[03:12:37.720 --> 03:12:41.640]  was aware of it but they were assured oh they're going to delete the data as
[03:12:41.640 --> 03:12:45.240]  soon as they collect it they talk to you like your five
[03:12:45.240 --> 03:12:49.720]  year old children the company admitted last week that the car's radio antenna
[03:12:49.720 --> 03:12:53.000]  obtained emails and other bits of information when the vehicles passed
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:57.400]  through towns and cities google said the data was mistakenly collected
[03:12:57.400 --> 03:13:00.440]  and only in short bursts as the vehicles passed by
[03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:05.640]  and was never used we're continuing uh we're continually struggling with the
[03:13:05.640 --> 03:13:09.160]  questions said schmidt we have to decide what is and what isn't
[03:13:09.160 --> 03:13:13.800]  appropriate in the privacy sphere each government and company will decide
[03:13:13.800 --> 03:13:17.000]  differently i don't agree they're not deciding
[03:13:17.000 --> 03:13:20.920]  differently they're beta testing separate programs across the world in my
[03:13:20.920 --> 03:13:23.720]  film invisible empire i chronicle how the uk
[03:13:23.720 --> 03:13:28.040]  for the last year plus has been putting cctv cameras
[03:13:28.040 --> 03:13:31.640]  in sin bin family homes in other words their cps
[03:13:31.640 --> 03:13:35.080]  decides what families are bad and now they're surveilled in their homes
[03:13:35.080 --> 03:13:39.400]  with cctv cameras this is just another step we also
[03:13:39.400 --> 03:13:43.560]  expose an invisible empire atnt and all the other large telecommunication
[03:13:43.560 --> 03:13:47.080]  companies out there which google is becoming a part of folks with their
[03:13:47.080 --> 03:13:50.600]  android phone with their chrome software chrome
[03:13:50.600 --> 03:13:53.960]  is another internet browser it revealed that oh they are
[03:13:53.960 --> 03:13:58.680]  also taking all of the information and dumping it into a secret room
[03:13:58.680 --> 03:14:02.360]  on a private server everything you've done
[03:14:02.360 --> 03:14:06.440]  on the internet for the past 10 years get
[03:14:06.440 --> 03:14:10.280]  with reality are i want to play this clip briefly do we have we not have yet
[03:14:10.280 --> 03:14:12.440]  all right so we'll play it in the next segment
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:16.520]  of eric schmidt talking about the new world order but this is
[03:14:16.520 --> 03:14:19.480]  so important to understand these people need to be
[03:14:19.480 --> 03:14:23.080]  prosecuted and then punished to the fullest extent of the law and journalists
[03:14:23.080 --> 03:14:27.880]  need to do their jobs and attend to this situation
[03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:34.120]  as front page news 90 percent of you out there have google as your home page
[03:14:34.120 --> 03:14:37.880]  we use it on a daily basis the word is now
[03:14:37.880 --> 03:14:43.320]  synonymous with the web it is ingrained in not only pop culture
[03:14:43.320 --> 03:14:48.040]  but culture in general and i want to move on to another
[03:14:48.040 --> 03:14:53.240]  tech story because pakistan is now blocking facebook if you don't
[03:14:53.240 --> 03:14:56.840]  understand why we get on the air we talk about the cyber
[03:14:56.840 --> 03:15:01.000]  security act the cyber bullying act obama's plans and he openly talked
[03:15:01.000 --> 03:15:04.680]  about this months and months and months ago to set up a cyber security office
[03:15:04.680 --> 03:15:09.320]  with a cyber security czar cnn playing these
[03:15:09.320 --> 03:15:13.000]  wacko scenarios where michael shartoff and others are talking about
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:16.840]  regulating the internet as though it's real
[03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:19.960]  oh my god a crisis has happened and you know what if the people don't like it
[03:15:19.960 --> 03:15:24.280]  that's too damn bad and you know what if the governors don't like
[03:15:24.280 --> 03:15:29.080]  the national guard being on the streets with us military that's too damn bad to
[03:15:29.080 --> 03:15:32.840]  watch it for yourself so muslim anger prompts pakistan to block facebook
[03:15:32.840 --> 03:15:37.000]  and this is how the media plays us off against one each one another
[03:15:37.000 --> 03:15:40.360]  how they really divide cultures pakistan's government ordered internet
[03:15:40.360 --> 03:15:42.760]  service providers to block facebook on wednesday
[03:15:42.760 --> 03:15:46.360]  amid anger over a page that encourages users to post images
[03:15:46.360 --> 03:15:52.760]  of who islam's prophet muhammad and all of this stuff is now hyped up
[03:15:52.760 --> 03:15:55.560]  almost a decade later really almost nine years later
[03:15:55.560 --> 03:15:59.640]  after nine eleven without nine eleven people don't understand no one really
[03:15:59.640 --> 03:16:03.480]  cared about these cartoons or depictions of muhammad because the media
[03:16:03.480 --> 03:16:07.640]  didn't play them up to incite violence and misunderstanding and
[03:16:07.640 --> 03:16:12.520]  miscommunication among americans and the middle east
[03:16:12.520 --> 03:16:16.120]  the facebook page at the center of the dispute everybody draw muhammad day
[03:16:16.120 --> 03:16:20.520]  encourages users to post the images of prophet on may 20th to protest threads
[03:16:20.520 --> 03:16:24.120]  made by a radical muslim group against the creators of south park
[03:16:24.120 --> 03:16:27.880]  for depicting muhammad in a bear suit during an episode
[03:16:27.880 --> 03:16:32.360]  earlier this year now if you're unaware of this whole south park situation
[03:16:32.360 --> 03:16:36.680]  before nine eleven south park did an episode called the super best friends
[03:16:36.680 --> 03:16:40.040]  it was kind of a ripoff of wonder woman and superman but instead it was all
[03:16:40.040 --> 03:16:43.640]  these different religious figures and then they didn't know it wasn't proper
[03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:47.080]  to show an image of muhammad so the network didn't know the south park
[03:16:47.080 --> 03:16:51.720]  guys didn't know they showed muhammad no one made a big deal about it was on
[03:16:51.720 --> 03:16:55.160]  screen for 22 plus minutes no one said a word nobody
[03:16:55.160 --> 03:17:00.840]  not a word so then 10 plus years later after nine 11 they
[03:17:00.840 --> 03:17:04.200]  want to use the same character and now they have a huge censored box
[03:17:04.200 --> 03:17:09.000]  you can't hear him you can't see him they're just showing you the absurdity
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:13.240]  about not being able to satirize a very public figure
[03:17:13.240 --> 03:17:17.160]  in muhammad a very public religious figure and now it's all over the place
[03:17:17.160 --> 03:17:19.800]  and it's used for division and it is prompted
[03:17:19.800 --> 03:17:23.960]  pakistan pakistan to block facebook can you
[03:17:23.960 --> 03:17:28.200]  imagine living in a country much like china where they just block youtube
[03:17:28.200 --> 03:17:31.240]  they block facebook you no longer have a way to get
[03:17:31.240 --> 03:17:35.320]  open source information that's why the internet is so
[03:17:35.320 --> 03:17:39.720]  important in this info war without it we couldn't put films like don't tread on
[03:17:39.720 --> 03:17:42.440]  me the latest film from gary franchi and william
[03:17:42.440 --> 03:17:46.360]  lewis over at prismplanet.tv for subscribers we wouldn't be able to put
[03:17:46.360 --> 03:17:51.160]  invisible empire up on youtube for free with over 360 000 views
[03:17:51.160 --> 03:17:55.800]  on just one link there's another full link out there with 50 000 views
[03:17:55.800 --> 03:17:59.400]  the thing has been seen by over half a million people
[03:17:59.400 --> 03:18:04.120]  easily easily in the last month that's how we have victories
[03:18:04.120 --> 03:18:07.320]  people become aware of the issues and then involved and then they go to the
[03:18:07.320 --> 03:18:10.520]  voting booths and they vote rand paul and they vote
[03:18:10.520 --> 03:18:14.600]  arlyn warren commission specter out of office after all these years
[03:18:14.600 --> 03:18:19.720]  this is a guy that's been around forever specter is about as limited hangout
[03:18:19.720 --> 03:18:22.360]  as you can get if you are unaware of this individual
[03:18:22.360 --> 03:18:26.200]  he also headed up the abled danger hearings which really
[03:18:26.200 --> 03:18:29.880]  were supposed to shine light on this black ops program
[03:18:29.880 --> 03:18:33.320]  headed by tony schaffer who's done this show now several times
[03:18:33.320 --> 03:18:36.280]  and his unit with eric clinesmith and others that they had found
[03:18:36.280 --> 03:18:41.720]  otta and three of the other cells prior to 9 11 and tried to go to the fbi 70
[03:18:41.720 --> 03:18:46.120]  plus times and you know what arlyn block the truth specter does
[03:18:46.120 --> 03:18:50.680]  he sits up there and panders to the situation and talks about oh it must be
[03:18:50.680 --> 03:18:54.520]  because of posi commentatus posi commentatus is a bad thing
[03:18:54.520 --> 03:18:59.080]  no posi commentatus is a good thing it's a separation of the military
[03:18:59.080 --> 03:19:03.400]  and police we have it for a reason and posi commentatus had nothing to do
[03:19:03.400 --> 03:19:06.760]  with abled danger and they were very willing to break
[03:19:06.760 --> 03:19:12.200]  that premise at the g20 in pittsburgh when they put troops on the street so
[03:19:12.200 --> 03:19:17.800]  goodbye arlyn specter and hell oh liberty let's get
[03:19:17.800 --> 03:19:21.320]  ram paul into the senate let's take this to the next level
[03:19:21.320 --> 03:19:26.520]  let's scream from the mountaintops that we can have victories let people know
[03:19:26.520 --> 03:19:29.240]  that google isn't the savior it doesn't have
[03:19:29.240 --> 03:19:33.160]  your best interests at heart on the other side i really want to get into
[03:19:33.160 --> 03:19:35.960]  this situation in afghanistan because some of the headlines are there
[03:19:35.960 --> 03:19:41.160]  oh no the taliban's attacking us bases wait a minute we hire taliban we created
[03:19:41.160 --> 03:19:45.000]  al-qaeda we run the militant groups that and much
[03:19:45.000 --> 03:19:47.320]  much more coming up it's the alex jones show i'm jason
[03:19:47.320 --> 03:20:01.240]  bermas sitting in prison planet dot tv info wars dot com
[03:20:01.240 --> 03:20:05.400]  on the average americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough
[03:20:05.400 --> 03:20:08.040]  wealth to retire and live out their golden years
[03:20:08.040 --> 03:20:13.000]  unfortunately with taxation the rising cost of food energy housing and medical
[03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:16.120]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line
[03:20:16.120 --> 03:20:19.560]  is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the federal
[03:20:19.560 --> 03:20:22.040]  reserve note forcing us into perpetual debt

[03:24:17.240 --> 03:24:20.920]  program we're going to be taking calls in the next segment
[03:24:20.920 --> 03:24:26.120]  and wrapping up what i had to say about eric schmidt the ceo of google denying
[03:24:26.120 --> 03:24:29.800]  that google was actively taking this data and information and telling
[03:24:29.800 --> 03:24:34.760]  prosecutors not to investigate is absolutely obscene and
[03:24:34.760 --> 03:24:37.720]  absolutely absurd they were out there to take
[03:24:37.720 --> 03:24:41.160]  photographs and they were data mining the entire
[03:24:41.160 --> 03:24:44.760]  country and putting this information on a hard drive they say they didn't use it
[03:24:44.760 --> 03:24:48.040]  oh no they never used it but we're going to play this
[03:24:48.040 --> 03:24:52.520]  clip and this is from the finale the credits of invisible empire a new world
[03:24:52.520 --> 03:24:55.400]  order defined so you might hear another couple new world order quotes
[03:24:55.400 --> 03:24:59.400]  including one from james wolsey the x director of the cia
[03:24:59.400 --> 03:25:02.600]  but we're also going to show you eric schmidt talking about what
[03:25:02.600 --> 03:25:07.320]  the new world order the system in which he is a part of so let's hit that clip
[03:25:07.320 --> 03:25:11.320]  a lot about that today let's take the new world order it's an interesting phrase
[03:25:11.320 --> 03:25:13.720]  i've been thinking a little bit about the structure of the world right the new
[03:25:13.720 --> 03:25:17.080]  world order as everybody says there it is right there and then here comes
[03:25:17.080 --> 03:25:20.840]  sakas philly so there is the new world schmidt is talking
[03:25:20.840 --> 03:25:24.120]  what about the structure of the world the new world
[03:25:24.120 --> 03:25:28.600]  order as they call it and he's talking about the elitist in which he works
[03:25:28.600 --> 03:25:34.680]  with to track trace and database our lives before i get to afghanistan i just
[03:25:34.680 --> 03:25:37.960]  have to do this story which is completely
[03:25:37.960 --> 03:25:42.280]  absurd there is a county out there in denver
[03:25:42.280 --> 03:25:46.120]  that is now going to be charging 50 cents a bus ride
[03:25:46.120 --> 03:25:52.600]  50 cents a bus ride for your children now that's a dollar a day folks now you
[03:25:52.600 --> 03:25:56.600]  already pay your school taxes you pay your state taxes what could they be
[03:25:56.600 --> 03:25:59.880]  using this for well you're not going to believe it until i tell you
[03:25:59.880 --> 03:26:04.840]  but they're using it for a program to put gps systems
[03:26:04.840 --> 03:26:09.080]  in all of the buses in that schools county
[03:26:09.080 --> 03:26:12.120]  isn't that lovely you not only pay the school taxes but you're also going to
[03:26:12.120 --> 03:26:15.800]  be paying a dollar a day per child on top of that
[03:26:15.800 --> 03:26:19.400]  towards a gps system in all of the buses
[03:26:19.400 --> 03:26:23.560]  in which your child will be given a card and he will swipe so they're going to
[03:26:23.560 --> 03:26:28.520]  be tracking tracing and databaseing your child on the school bus
[03:26:28.520 --> 03:26:32.760]  let me repeat that for you on the school bus there is no
[03:26:32.760 --> 03:26:36.440]  where to go in meanwhile we just have president obama
[03:26:36.440 --> 03:26:41.000]  inviting the mexican president to stand on the white house lawn and denounce
[03:26:41.000 --> 03:26:45.160]  arizona's state law so let me just uh read this article
[03:26:45.160 --> 03:26:48.120]  really quickly and then we're going to get into the situation in afghanistan
[03:26:48.120 --> 03:26:53.640]  douglas county votes to charge fees for school bus rides this past five to zero
[03:26:53.640 --> 03:26:57.240]  parents in colorado's third largest school district the third
[03:26:57.240 --> 03:27:00.760]  largest school district are being asked to pay if their kids want to ride
[03:27:00.760 --> 03:27:04.280]  the school bus think about that most of these kids
[03:27:04.280 --> 03:27:08.440]  with parents with jobs need to ride the school bus they have to go to work
[03:27:08.440 --> 03:27:12.600]  the douglas county school board voted five to zero tuesday night to approve a
[03:27:12.600 --> 03:27:17.720]  50 cent per ride transportation fee starting next school year so a dollar
[03:27:17.720 --> 03:27:23.800]  a day to get to school and back home the buses will have zoner gps units to
[03:27:23.800 --> 03:27:29.160]  track student ridership they admitted about tracking tracing and
[03:27:29.160 --> 03:27:32.600]  databaseing your kids students will have to use a card or a
[03:27:32.600 --> 03:27:35.800]  z pass that will track their use of the bus
[03:27:35.800 --> 03:27:38.920]  douglas county schools will have to pay two hundred and twenty one thousand
[03:27:38.920 --> 03:27:42.360]  dollars in three equal installments over the next three
[03:27:42.360 --> 03:27:47.320]  years so about seven hundred thousand dollars a year for the next three years
[03:27:47.320 --> 03:27:50.440]  two point one million dollars to fully implement
[03:27:50.440 --> 03:27:54.760]  the gps tracking technology that cost covers the system
[03:27:54.760 --> 03:27:59.720]  as a whole oh we get to pay for our slavery how
[03:27:59.720 --> 03:28:03.320]  lovely and that kind of dovetails in with uc berkeley
[03:28:03.320 --> 03:28:07.720]  asking incoming students for dna if you're going to berkeley folks
[03:28:07.720 --> 03:28:11.960]  refuse the dna just say no say you know what i don't think i'm going to be part
[03:28:11.960 --> 03:28:14.280]  of that if you really want me to spend
[03:28:14.280 --> 03:28:17.880]  forty thousand dollars this year this semester at your school
[03:28:17.880 --> 03:28:21.800]  maybe you don't take the quat the cotton swab all right
[03:28:21.800 --> 03:28:25.800]  now let's get into afghanistan alex jones last week on his program
[03:28:25.800 --> 03:28:30.760]  played the herald o fox news clip in which they just come out and admit yeah

[03:28:34.200 --> 03:28:38.040]  with the farmers to protect you for malcata meanwhile
[03:28:38.040 --> 03:28:42.280]  it is literally the same network that was caught in the iran contra affair
[03:28:42.280 --> 03:28:45.400]  do you not understand robert gates was involved in that
[03:28:45.400 --> 03:28:49.240]  and now he's our secretary of defense we're not leaving
[03:28:49.240 --> 03:28:54.600]  anytime soon and this is going to continue afghan prosecutor issues arrest

[03:28:58.200 --> 03:29:02.840]  police so why is this important well this dovetails into it any of the local
[03:29:02.840 --> 03:29:05.480]  authorities that try to put a stop to any of these militant
[03:29:05.480 --> 03:29:10.040]  activities that are ruining their country they just get gunned down by who

[03:34:33.080 --> 03:34:36.840]  this was out of the guardian over the weekend afghan prosecutor issues arrest
[03:34:36.840 --> 03:34:39.960]  warrant for us army officer over police killing see
[03:34:39.960 --> 03:34:44.920]  they're trying to go to the source the heart of the issue the us military
[03:34:44.920 --> 03:34:48.440]  officer that is training these militants and
[03:34:48.440 --> 03:34:52.840]  authorizing these assassinations and much worse afghan soldiers patrol a
[03:34:52.840 --> 03:34:56.680]  taliban stronghold in kandahar an afghan prosecutor has issued an
[03:34:56.680 --> 03:35:01.320]  arrest warrant for a us special forces officer over the murder
[03:35:01.320 --> 03:35:05.560]  of a police chief by us trained militia
[03:35:05.560 --> 03:35:09.880]  forces brigadier general galloom ronjabar the chief military prosecutor
[03:35:09.880 --> 03:35:13.240]  in kabul has accused the us of creating an outlaw militia
[03:35:13.240 --> 03:35:16.920]  see they use proxy networks for plausible
[03:35:16.920 --> 03:35:19.880]  deniability so they don't have to get their hands dirty
[03:35:19.880 --> 03:35:23.800]  directly which allegedly yes right allegedly
[03:35:23.800 --> 03:35:27.320]  shot dead matula kate the chief of police in the city of kandahar
[03:35:27.320 --> 03:35:31.000]  he accused american officials of refusing to hand over evidence or to
[03:35:31.000 --> 03:35:35.160]  permit his investigators to an interview the special forces commander
[03:35:35.160 --> 03:35:39.320]  and what's his name known to afghans only as john or johnny
[03:35:39.320 --> 03:35:43.400]  he alleges sanctioned the raid so they don't even say i'm a colonel
[03:35:43.400 --> 03:35:47.960]  i'm a general this is my name they give out one of the dozens of aliases
[03:35:47.960 --> 03:35:52.680]  to the masses so again they're not prosecutable they cannot be traced back
[03:35:52.680 --> 03:35:57.240]  to the crime this is standard operating procedure and has been
[03:35:57.240 --> 03:36:01.800]  for over half a century the arrest warrant which has been circulated to
[03:36:01.800 --> 03:36:04.680]  border posts and airports as an embarrassment for the u.s military
[03:36:04.680 --> 03:36:08.120]  which is facing growing criticism for its links to militia militias controlled
[03:36:08.120 --> 03:36:11.880]  by who warlords and of course the head warlord is while
[03:36:11.880 --> 03:36:16.200]  lead amed karzai amed karzai's brother and the
[03:36:16.200 --> 03:36:20.120]  lead opium dealer supported by who the cia for the last eight years
[03:36:20.120 --> 03:36:24.440]  superseding both the bush and obama administrations in kandahar the
[03:36:24.440 --> 03:36:28.760]  militias have been accused of murder rape and extortion range of arson
[03:36:28.760 --> 03:36:32.680]  investigation found the force that killed kata operated from where
[03:36:32.680 --> 03:36:37.480]  camp get go us military training facility
[03:36:37.480 --> 03:36:41.560]  in the hills outside of kandahar a base for both us special forces and who
[03:36:41.560 --> 03:36:47.160]  the cia there it is right there folks for prison planet dot tv viewers
[03:36:47.160 --> 03:36:50.360]  if you go to kandahar people say these guys pretend to be interpreters
[03:36:50.360 --> 03:36:54.040]  but they carry out night raids and assassinations at ranch bar we hear lots
[03:36:54.040 --> 03:36:57.560]  of strange and shocking stories but according to the afghan account the
[03:36:57.560 --> 03:37:01.240]  militia known locally as kandahar strike force or the kandahar special
[03:37:01.240 --> 03:37:05.320]  group arrived in the courthouse last june with us supplied
[03:37:05.320 --> 03:37:11.000]  uniforms vehicles and weapons and who are they linked to again
[03:37:11.000 --> 03:37:18.280]  karzai's brother amid walley karzai it's all here in black and white when
[03:37:18.280 --> 03:37:22.280]  are we going to wake up and then the new york times does this
[03:37:22.280 --> 03:37:26.520]  puff piece which intercedes with this information despite doubts u.s still
[03:37:26.520 --> 03:37:29.560]  uses private spies where were you doubting this
[03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:33.160]  the military industrial complex always uses black water
[03:37:33.160 --> 03:37:37.240]  lockheed martin raytheon to carry out some of their dirty work
[03:37:37.240 --> 03:37:41.880]  top military officials have continued to rely on a secret network of private
[03:37:41.880 --> 03:37:44.280]  spies who have produced hundreds of reports
[03:37:44.280 --> 03:37:48.120]  from deep inside afghanistan and pakistan according to american officials
[03:37:48.120 --> 03:37:51.640]  and businessmen despite concerns among some in the military about the
[03:37:51.640 --> 03:37:55.800]  legality of the operation because it is illegal
[03:37:55.800 --> 03:37:59.240]  illegal earlier this year government officials admitted that the military
[03:37:59.240 --> 03:38:02.520]  had sent a group of former central intelligence agency officers notice
[03:38:02.520 --> 03:38:05.080]  that former central intelligence agency officers
[03:38:05.080 --> 03:38:08.760]  and retired special operation troops mercenaries folks
[03:38:08.760 --> 03:38:13.080]  into the region to collect information some of which was used to track and kill
[03:38:13.080 --> 03:38:17.160]  people suspected of being militants interviews with more than a dozen
[03:38:17.160 --> 03:38:19.400]  current and former government officials and businessmen
[03:38:19.400 --> 03:38:23.640]  and an examination of government documents tell the story
[03:38:23.640 --> 03:38:28.040]  under pentagon rules the army is not allowed to hire contractors for spying
[03:38:28.040 --> 03:38:31.960]  but they are but of course military officials said that general david h
[03:38:31.960 --> 03:38:35.640]  patrice the top commander in the region signed off on the operation in january
[03:38:35.640 --> 03:38:39.480]  of 09 there were prohibitions against intelligence
[03:38:39.480 --> 03:38:42.520]  gathering including hiring agents to provide information about enemy
[03:38:42.520 --> 03:38:46.200]  positions in pakistan and again if you watch invisible empire
[03:38:46.200 --> 03:38:49.640]  we have one of the one of the main contractors there
[03:38:49.640 --> 03:38:52.680]  talking about the contracting talking about patrice's
[03:38:52.680 --> 03:38:56.280]  coin strategy and what part of coin strategy are they talking about
[03:38:56.280 --> 03:39:03.320]  oh biometrically taking the scans of everybody in a combat zone and hiring
[03:39:03.320 --> 03:39:08.840]  local nationals aka the taliban and he admits that they work with
[03:39:08.840 --> 03:39:12.360]  the taliban there but the taliban are our enemies jason how does this work
[03:39:12.360 --> 03:39:16.200]  and then they go on to say that this is managed managed and zoom in here
[03:39:16.200 --> 03:39:22.440]  managed by who lockheed martin lockheed martin and supervised by the pentagon
[03:39:22.440 --> 03:39:28.280]  office in charge of special operations policy lockheed martin running the
[03:39:28.280 --> 03:39:31.800]  secret spy network that interconnects with u.s special
[03:39:31.800 --> 03:39:37.080]  forces and the cia where they go murder local police
[03:39:37.080 --> 03:39:40.040]  officials all right i said i'd go to your call so we're going to hit it up
[03:39:40.040 --> 03:39:45.080]  we're taking your calls pastor in ohio pastor you're online
[03:39:45.080 --> 03:39:49.720]  yeah but i was calling earlier when alex had his guest on but
[03:39:49.720 --> 03:39:53.000]  one of the things i was listening to what you're saying
[03:39:53.000 --> 03:39:56.600]  now one of the things you talk about deception
[03:39:56.600 --> 03:40:00.280]  um we just are our uh columbus
[03:40:00.280 --> 03:40:06.760]  ohio mayor just met with barack obama about uh closed doors as a matter of
[03:40:06.760 --> 03:40:10.920]  fact him and newt newark new jersey mayor minneapolis
[03:40:10.920 --> 03:40:14.680]  minnesota mayor they all met with him this past week
[03:40:14.680 --> 03:40:19.800]  there yesterday talking about terrorism now they're bringing up some millions
[03:40:19.800 --> 03:40:23.080]  that live in the in the columbus area and stuff
[03:40:23.080 --> 03:40:30.200]  but the problem is it's all it was a matter of national security
[03:40:30.200 --> 03:40:33.160]  and with all the things that you know you guys have been
[03:40:33.160 --> 03:40:37.640]  allowing us the people to know i mean you guys are sharing your knowledge with
[03:40:37.640 --> 03:40:40.840]  us as far as everything is going on around the world
[03:40:40.840 --> 03:40:45.000]  you know i just want uh first of all pray you for you guys for what you're
[03:40:45.000 --> 03:40:47.560]  doing because more and more people are waking up
[03:40:47.560 --> 03:40:51.080]  well pastor listen i appreciate the call and there has been
[03:40:51.080 --> 03:40:54.440]  a effort to really demonize somali pirates
[03:40:54.440 --> 03:40:57.800]  around the world and say those somali pirates they're terrorists now
[03:40:57.800 --> 03:41:00.840]  everybody's a terrorist there's no other terms out there you do something
[03:41:00.840 --> 03:41:04.840]  bad you're a terrorist so they may be using them as the next
[03:41:04.840 --> 03:41:09.320]  scapegoat the next patsy in their false flag operations and we have to be very
[03:41:09.320 --> 03:41:13.800]  wary of that appreciate the call john in ohio john you're online
[03:41:13.800 --> 03:41:17.640]  yeah i've been waiting to talk to alex too but i can talk to you
[03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:20.840]  and a minute or two just wouldn't it be silly to think that uh
[03:41:20.840 --> 03:41:24.760]  my disagreements on certain points could be to develop that way something like
[03:41:24.760 --> 03:41:30.520]  wsws.org or workers.org for having a program uninterrupted for a year might
[03:41:30.520 --> 03:41:34.440]  do it but i i wanted to make the point that i think uh
[03:41:34.440 --> 03:41:38.760]  alex in this program uh is really fighting the imf the world bank the
[03:41:38.760 --> 03:41:42.600]  ci the military industrial complex on half of its positions but is
[03:41:42.600 --> 03:41:45.240]  absolutely strongly supporting them on the other half
[03:41:45.240 --> 03:41:50.200]  hold on let's stop what are we possibly supporting on the imf
[03:41:50.200 --> 03:41:53.640]  what are we possibly supporting on global governance what are we possibly
[03:41:53.640 --> 03:41:56.840]  supporting you're not going to have that much time so give me at least one
[03:41:56.840 --> 03:42:01.640]  well put example sir well there's a i've got about ten but uh if you're talking
[03:42:01.640 --> 03:42:05.000]  about that when alex uses an example of uh
[03:42:05.000 --> 03:42:09.400]  censorship and all the constantly uh piggybacks on the uh uh corporate media
[03:42:09.400 --> 03:42:12.680]  is a bashing of uh chavez rather than the country right
[03:42:12.680 --> 03:42:17.400]  oh come on let's stop john chavez is a dictator
[03:42:17.400 --> 03:42:21.640]  out and out he stopped media companies throughout his country over the last
[03:42:21.640 --> 03:42:25.480]  12 months openly i feature him as one of my dictators
[03:42:25.480 --> 03:42:29.160]  very briefly an invisible empire has chavez done some good things
[03:42:29.160 --> 03:42:32.840]  sure he's done some good things out there but he is a dictator
[03:42:32.840 --> 03:42:35.720]  you can't vote him out of power that's not freedom
[03:42:35.720 --> 03:42:40.360]  that's not a constitutional republic i'm not pro communist man
[03:42:40.360 --> 03:42:44.280]  and neither is alex jones that's not running for the imf in the world bank
[03:42:44.280 --> 03:42:48.600]  to point out that he's not good either that i'm a dina denigot although he
[03:42:48.600 --> 03:42:51.560]  speaks some truth he talks nine eleven truth he talks about some truth he
[03:42:51.560 --> 03:42:54.120]  should be able to be a sovereign nation to be left alone
[03:42:54.120 --> 03:42:58.200]  he's not great either i i just can't agree with this stuff john i'm sorry
[03:42:58.200 --> 03:43:03.000]  nick in arkansas you're online yes sir

[03:43:36.360 --> 03:43:40.600]  uh do you know of any candidates uh in this area that are pro uh gun pro
[03:43:40.600 --> 03:43:45.080]  libertarian against the new world order and not off the bat in arkansas but i

[03:43:58.680 --> 03:44:01.480]  place not just around the globe but in this country
[03:44:01.480 --> 03:44:06.040]  and all the subversion by fox news trying to take over the tea party events

[03:45:12.440 --> 03:45:15.720]  and he said after further looking into it
[03:45:15.720 --> 03:45:20.360]  he's changed his position and believes based on the wording in that bill
[03:45:20.360 --> 03:45:24.280]  it's actually a backdoor for the federal government to come in
[03:45:24.280 --> 03:45:27.960]  do what that bill calls for for immigrants or for illegals
[03:45:27.960 --> 03:45:31.720]  for anybody in the united states it's like the patriot act does with so-called
[03:45:31.720 --> 03:45:34.680]  terrorists well i gotta tell you steven when it was first introduced to me and
[03:45:34.680 --> 03:45:37.800]  i didn't know much about it i said that very same thing that a lot of these
[03:45:37.800 --> 03:45:41.640]  laws look good on the surface but they're a back door for global governance
[03:45:41.640 --> 03:45:45.560]  and federal control so i'm gonna have to take a look at it but i i don't know
[03:45:45.560 --> 03:45:48.520]  as far as i know the way it's being carried out right now if they pull
[03:45:48.520 --> 03:45:51.720]  somebody over and they appear to be an illegal immigrant i don't think it's a
[03:45:51.720 --> 03:45:54.920]  bad thing to check if they have a consulate matricula card or they
[03:45:54.920 --> 03:45:58.120]  indeed are a citizen if not they send them over the border i think that is a
[03:45:58.120 --> 03:46:00.360]  good thing appreciate the call before i go to
[03:46:00.360 --> 03:46:04.440]  jim in illinois and dalton in georgia i want to go back to that caller that was
[03:46:04.440 --> 03:46:06.760]  pro-communist for a moment this is what happens
[03:46:06.760 --> 03:46:11.560]  with communism this headline china organ trafficking trial exposes grizzly
[03:46:11.560 --> 03:46:14.040]  trade and throughout this they try to make it look
[03:46:14.040 --> 03:46:18.280]  you know kind of sexy and this guy who was trafficking organs he's a good guy
[03:46:18.280 --> 03:46:22.040]  actually he never sold bad organs and it tells you a beijing court is
[03:46:22.040 --> 03:46:25.800]  prosecuting a man for illegal organ trafficking local media reported putting
[03:46:25.800 --> 03:46:29.400]  the spotlight on a grizzly black market in body parts in a country where the
[03:46:29.400 --> 03:46:32.920]  demand for transplants bar outstrips supply and
[03:46:32.920 --> 03:46:36.280]  he's a big hero and he's being prosecuted by the government but at the
[03:46:36.280 --> 03:46:41.080]  end they admit where is the most organ harvesting coming from
[03:46:41.080 --> 03:46:45.400]  well from prisons in china however the majority of organs from transplant
[03:46:45.400 --> 03:46:49.480]  transplant are still where harvested from executed criminals
[03:46:49.480 --> 03:46:53.240]  the paper said beijing hopes the new system will end both live transplants
[03:46:53.240 --> 03:46:56.920]  and taking organs from prisoners which makes senior officials
[03:46:56.920 --> 03:46:59.800]  uncomfortable and it only makes them uncomfortable when they have to talk
[03:46:59.800 --> 03:47:03.400]  about it because otherwise they're making big profits on the black market
[03:47:03.400 --> 03:47:07.720]  they should be on trial executed prisoners are definitely not a proper
[03:47:07.720 --> 03:47:10.840]  source for organ transplants said the vice minister
[03:47:10.840 --> 03:47:16.440]  hung jiffo telling the china daily yeah right but you'll continue to do it
[03:47:16.440 --> 03:47:20.200]  let's go to jim in illinois jim your line
[03:47:20.200 --> 03:47:24.120]  hi thanks you got um i've heard uh recently here about
[03:47:24.120 --> 03:47:29.480]  the uh the legal immigration thing you know i live in chicago and you guys uh
[03:47:29.480 --> 03:47:32.520]  i don't know if you have any calls from people from chicago or napple let me
[03:47:32.520 --> 03:47:36.120]  just tell you something it's so bad here where i live
[03:47:36.120 --> 03:47:39.480]  that they'll intimidate you until you pretty much move out of the area unless
[03:47:39.480 --> 03:47:42.600]  you stand up and say no i'm not going to have any of that i'm not going to be the
[03:47:42.600 --> 03:47:45.880]  victim and i'm not going to be the criminal um
[03:47:45.880 --> 03:47:50.600]  and recently here i was listening to two states policemen
[03:47:50.600 --> 03:47:58.120]  and uh an off duty judge uh or off duty cop and a judge and um
[03:47:58.120 --> 03:48:03.400]  a guy from the national guard talking about you will be processed one way or
[03:48:03.400 --> 03:48:06.760]  another one way either is a victim or another
[03:48:06.760 --> 03:48:10.680]  way either is you standing up and saying no i won't have any more of this i i
[03:48:10.680 --> 03:48:14.040]  totally put my foot down i'm not going to be the victim anymore
[03:48:14.040 --> 03:48:17.320]  and in that case when you stand up for your rights and say no
[03:48:17.320 --> 03:48:21.320]  uh you're a criminal um and they laughed about it
[03:48:21.320 --> 03:48:25.560]  and the thing was that they were all talking about how the state police
[03:48:25.560 --> 03:48:29.480]  and the illinois uh national guard here uh have been
[03:48:29.480 --> 03:48:33.000]  uh working in conjunction with mayor davie's office and that they that i'm
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:36.200]  going to tell you this right now this is a prediction and i hope you guys are
[03:48:36.200 --> 03:48:40.360]  recording this illinois is going to be the first police state in the united
[03:48:40.360 --> 03:48:44.920]  states and how do i know that because the judge that was sitting at that bar
[03:48:44.920 --> 03:48:48.280]  at that local establishment wasn't a bar but it was like a drinking
[03:48:48.280 --> 03:48:53.240]  dining establishment he said that he sees this happening within the next
[03:48:53.240 --> 03:48:58.440]  2.5 years that that and probably even before that
[03:48:58.440 --> 03:49:03.000]  within eight months was the other guys uh um
[03:49:03.000 --> 03:49:07.320]  was jim i appreciate the call and we will definitely keep our eye on illinois
[03:49:07.320 --> 03:49:10.600]  dalton in georgia dalton you're online
[03:49:10.600 --> 03:49:14.520]  um let's go to justin in colorado justin you're online
[03:49:14.520 --> 03:49:20.600]  hey how's it going uh okay uh yes i have a i have a document this is a just a
[03:49:20.600 --> 03:49:23.800]  following up on your like that bus thing you were saying in colorado
[03:49:23.800 --> 03:49:28.680]  yes um yes i got this uh there's a notice i got from the school district
[03:49:28.680 --> 03:49:33.560]  for my sister uh it's saying that on every student district in car out is
[03:49:33.560 --> 03:49:37.320]  required reports the car out on it department of education each year
[03:49:37.320 --> 03:49:41.240]  um the federal government recently changed the reporting categories for
[03:49:41.240 --> 03:49:45.240]  student data to more accurately reflect the diversity of the country's present
[03:49:45.240 --> 03:49:49.720]  population under the new system you will now be asked to indicate both the
[03:49:49.720 --> 03:49:53.640]  ethnicity and the racial categories for your children
[03:49:53.640 --> 03:49:58.280]  on the data sheet um it has a couple there's a new question i've never seen
[03:49:58.280 --> 03:50:01.960]  this on any kind of ethnic question it's this number one
[03:50:01.960 --> 03:50:05.960]  ethnicity are you hispanic or latino yes or no
[03:50:05.960 --> 03:50:10.360]  and if you're not uh indicate which uh ethnicity you are
[03:50:10.360 --> 03:50:15.400]  which i'm thinking now uh that they want to uh
[03:50:15.400 --> 03:50:19.400]  they want to profile everybody they want to profile areas man they listen
[03:50:19.400 --> 03:50:22.920]  they want to charge you for it they want to track trace and database you once
[03:50:22.920 --> 03:50:26.440]  you're in the database that's when the massive profiling begins they'll have
[03:50:26.440 --> 03:50:30.760]  individual profiles community profiles they'll have county profiles and of
[03:50:30.760 --> 03:50:33.320]  course statewide profiles and they'll use
[03:50:33.320 --> 03:50:36.680]  this profiling information to divide and cons
[03:50:36.680 --> 03:50:40.440]  and uh and conquer that's the idea while they tax you for it
[03:50:40.440 --> 03:50:43.880]  while they tax you for it they are going to divide and conquer
[03:50:43.880 --> 03:50:48.280]  with your information while they enslave your children before your very eyes

[03:54:13.000 --> 03:54:15.880]  minutes before i go to some final calls there were two other stories i really
[03:54:15.880 --> 03:54:20.520]  wanted to hit up we often talk about the elites search for immortality and a lot
[03:54:20.520 --> 03:54:25.160]  of people will laugh at you and say oh jason that's just science fiction
[03:54:25.160 --> 03:54:29.800]  found genes that let you live to 100 this is times online they're calling them
[03:54:29.800 --> 03:54:33.480]  the mathusola genes after the biblical character
[03:54:33.480 --> 03:54:38.840]  that lived to be 969 you see folks only about one person in 10 000 actually
[03:54:38.840 --> 03:54:42.280]  lives to be the age of 100 so these centurions
[03:54:42.280 --> 03:54:46.120]  have now been examined they've looked at their genomes and they found out
[03:54:46.120 --> 03:54:50.600]  that they do have certain genes in common in 20 or 30 percentile
[03:54:50.600 --> 03:54:54.360]  that do allow them to live these long lives the genes are
[03:54:54.360 --> 03:55:03.320]  a d i p o q c e t p and a p o c 3 read the article it's a big one and the
[03:55:03.320 --> 03:55:05.720]  other thing i want to caution people about
[03:55:05.720 --> 03:55:09.320]  is they are now promoting cancer vaccines yes
[03:55:09.320 --> 03:55:13.320]  cancer vaccines that can kill tumors and in some cases they're saying within
[03:55:13.320 --> 03:55:17.320]  the next 10 years will prevent cancer all together be
[03:55:17.320 --> 03:55:22.120]  very wary of this remember when they gave out the polio vaccination folks they
[03:55:22.120 --> 03:55:26.440]  put sv 40 in it that simian virus 40 which was a live
[03:55:26.440 --> 03:55:30.840]  cancer virus which people sued over after family members died and were maimed
[03:55:30.840 --> 03:55:34.840]  and paralyzed and all sorts of other horrific things and won those lawsuits
[03:55:34.840 --> 03:55:39.960]  so be very cautious as they tell you oh we have a vaccine for cancer now
[03:55:39.960 --> 03:55:45.240]  andrea in kentucky you're online yes andrea
[03:55:45.240 --> 03:55:51.880]  hi bravo on uh invisible empire what an awesome movie oh thank you
[03:55:51.880 --> 03:55:56.680]  i just want to say at the victory rand paul here in kentucky everybody is so
[03:55:56.680 --> 03:56:01.000]  hyped up um the local media is already saying how
[03:56:01.000 --> 03:56:04.840]  uh jack conway which is his democratic opponent
[03:56:04.840 --> 03:56:09.880]  how he's going to have to run a perfect campaign and he is because he is up
[03:56:09.880 --> 03:56:13.880]  against you know what he's up against real liberty andrea
[03:56:13.880 --> 03:56:17.080]  he's up against the constitution in the bill of rights he's up against the
[03:56:17.080 --> 03:56:21.160]  people and quite frankly i don't think he stands a chance i think it is so
[03:56:21.160 --> 03:56:25.400]  exciting that rand paul ran away with the primary in kentucky and now we have
[03:56:25.400 --> 03:56:29.560]  to get him into office appreciate the call gotta jump jim in new york jim
[03:56:29.560 --> 03:56:33.320]  you're online yes jason this is my name is jim
[03:56:33.320 --> 03:56:37.400]  uh i'm trying to make this concise as possible
[03:56:37.400 --> 03:56:41.640]  you know i'm listening to this day of the day and i'm saying to myself
[03:56:41.640 --> 03:56:47.480]  what is the central theme if there is one that can co-lease our movement
[03:56:47.480 --> 03:56:51.560]  you know uh because they got a short in 40 different directions you know
[03:56:51.560 --> 03:56:56.280]  whether it's environmental or the southern nonsense i won't go through it
[03:56:56.280 --> 03:57:00.200]  but i received some letter today by the venetial county
[03:57:00.200 --> 03:57:04.920]  and uh capital improvement project and i thought that was i i find these
[03:57:04.920 --> 03:57:09.320]  humorous you know it's nonsense jim the bottom line is they are going to hit
[03:57:09.320 --> 03:57:12.680]  you from all angles whether it be the war on terror
[03:57:12.680 --> 03:57:16.360]  endless wars in the middle east for a eurasian union that benefit who the
[03:57:16.360 --> 03:57:20.120]  elite class in the military industrial complex a false
[03:57:20.120 --> 03:57:24.360]  environmental movement a move to literally taxing you
[03:57:24.360 --> 03:57:28.520]  to breathe on all levels to taxing you on how many cars you have how many
[03:57:28.520 --> 03:57:31.640]  kids you have helping your home is how much garbage
[03:57:31.640 --> 03:57:34.760]  you produce your carbon footprint demonizing
