[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:40.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.480 --> 00:44.920]  folks Obama just gave a speech in the Hague that's why I was almost late
[00:44.920 --> 00:51.280]  coming on air right now we were able to tape it off of C-span and we are finding
[00:51.280 --> 00:54.880]  the time code where he said it we should have it the next what 10 minutes or so
[00:54.880 --> 01:02.080]  no nobody's got it yet I mean drudge has Obama top worry nuke bombing New York
[01:02.080 --> 01:06.640]  City will put that up on screen this is a big deal folks because when they start
[01:06.640 --> 01:13.000]  hyping nukes going off in North Carolina or in Georgia or in New York City
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.800]  remember what happened earlier this year remember the Dias Air Force base and
[01:19.800 --> 01:26.800]  the report of the missing nukes that got dug up that they never denied and that
[01:26.800 --> 01:31.040]  the same day hours after we released that senator Lindsey Graham gave a
[01:31.040 --> 01:36.920]  speech saying nukes were on the west coast or that we could see a mushroom
[01:36.920 --> 01:41.120]  cloud if we didn't attack Iran and now they're saying their number one worry
[01:41.120 --> 01:47.560]  is basically Iran nuking Manhattan that's what Obama just said at the Hague
[01:47.560 --> 01:55.640]  when they threw Russia out of the G8 the United States and its closest allies
[01:55.640 --> 01:59.960]  today last night cast the Russia out of the group of G8 industrialized
[01:59.960 --> 02:05.040]  democracies the most exclusive club to punish quote Vladimir Putin this is the
[02:05.040 --> 02:10.800]  beginning of a new Cold War you see the world financial implosion accelerating
[02:10.800 --> 02:14.080]  and with that will come military conflict undoubtedly the question is will
[02:14.080 --> 02:19.520]  just be regional or proxy or will it be larger and with it you will see police
[02:19.520 --> 02:23.920]  state unfold worldwide this is just a historical cycle that we're dealing with
[02:23.920 --> 02:30.600]  here and the question is how serious will it be but I do not have words to
[02:30.600 --> 02:38.200]  describe what a big deal this is that Obama just said his number one worry is
[02:38.200 --> 02:44.960]  a nuke a suitcase nuke basically smuggled into New York City I've told you over
[02:44.960 --> 02:50.080]  and over again at nauseam including yesterday that if I was the globalist
[02:50.080 --> 02:54.040]  and I look at what they've set up the FEMA camps the training with demonization
[02:54.040 --> 02:58.600]  of Liberty Movement gun owners I would set off a nuke if I was the globalist I
[02:58.600 --> 03:04.040]  would never do this of course and blame it on political enemies and try to
[03:04.040 --> 03:08.880]  connect the Liberty Movement with radical Islam which I've been seeing in
[03:08.880 --> 03:12.080]  Pentagon public training manuals more and more it doesn't matter if it's
[03:12.080 --> 03:15.520]  asinine doesn't matter if it's ridiculous doesn't matter if it doesn't make
[03:15.520 --> 03:22.320]  sense doesn't matter if it's not based on reality I wargame this stuff as any
[03:22.320 --> 03:26.440]  person throughout history would do that's concerned with these issues and I
[03:26.440 --> 03:30.720]  can look through the enemy's eyes and look at their strategies and the
[03:30.720 --> 03:35.880]  different stratagems that they are developing and I'm telling you bigger
[03:35.880 --> 03:41.960]  than Dallas bigger than Dallas I see mushroom clouds in their hand doesn't
[03:41.960 --> 03:46.080]  mean they're gonna play that card it's a big deal to play the ace of spades we
[03:46.080 --> 03:54.200]  found the club here it is and so my response then continues to be what I
[03:54.200 --> 03:59.720]  believe today which is Russia's actions are a problem they don't pose the number
[03:59.720 --> 04:04.440]  one national security threat to the United States I continue to be much
[04:04.440 --> 04:11.400]  more concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear
[04:11.400 --> 04:17.120]  weapon going off in Manhattan which is part of the reason why the United States
[04:17.120 --> 04:23.520]  showing its continued international leadership has organized a friend
[04:23.520 --> 04:28.160]  listen guys we're gonna go to break grab that 32nd clip put it in our news
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.680]  format give it to the guys immediately no one's got this video just just you

[04:47.160 --> 04:51.960]  to our nuke warnings of nukes going off in Manhattan from three months ago
[04:51.960 --> 04:56.240]  obviously this is red-level information he wants to be able to say he warned us
[04:56.240 --> 05:01.760]  when the nuke goes off stay with us why does the United States spend the
[05:01.760 --> 05:05.920]  largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care why do we have the highest
[05:05.920 --> 05:11.440]  cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes autism and every

[08:18.400 --> 08:31.680]  ladies and gentlemen if you just joined us we played the clip in the last
[08:31.680 --> 08:39.280]  segment Obama said his top worry is quote not Russia but that his top worry
[08:39.280 --> 08:45.720]  is a nuke being smothered in the New York City and destroying Manhattan and
[08:45.720 --> 08:53.640]  you've got all of this endless hype going on all of this endless promotion of
[08:53.640 --> 08:58.640]  nuclear weapons that are supposedly missing they could use this to
[08:58.640 --> 09:08.600]  completely take over now folks you have to look at this in the backdrop of the
[09:08.600 --> 09:16.120]  fact that we saw missing nuclear weapons from Minot North Dakota down to
[09:16.120 --> 09:22.440]  Louisiana alternative media broke that story a bunch of people at the base were
[09:22.440 --> 09:27.400]  then killed disappeared suicided in a week and then the mainstream media had
[09:27.400 --> 09:33.360]  to admit that missing nuclear weapons had indeed happened cruise missiles by
[09:33.360 --> 09:38.880]  the way long-range advanced cruise missiles you can fire from thousands of
[09:38.880 --> 09:50.440]  miles away that happened under Dick Cheney what back in 2007 then we broke
[09:50.440 --> 09:54.520]  earlier this year back in January a report of nukes that weren't supposed to
[09:54.520 --> 09:59.520]  be at Dias Air Force Base in West Texas being dug up a total freak out at the
[09:59.520 --> 10:05.040]  base the base police who are civilian not allowing it to leave and being ordered
[10:05.040 --> 10:10.680]  by the commander of the base in person to allow the trucks to leave to the East
[10:10.680 --> 10:23.320]  Coast so we have that information taking place and if you look at it the way
[10:23.320 --> 10:26.560]  they set up continuity government which is really a martial law takeover system
[10:26.560 --> 10:29.680]  if you look at the homeland security preparations the threat fusion centers
[10:29.680 --> 10:33.920]  the training it's all about taking on the American people during a martial law
[10:33.920 --> 10:38.160]  event we talked about this at nauseam yesterday and I said my number one
[10:38.160 --> 10:42.880]  concern is criminal globalist criminal networks inside global governance
[10:42.880 --> 10:49.640]  inside the megabanks that run the planet detonating a nuclear weapon even a
[10:49.640 --> 10:57.240]  small one in somewhere like New York City as a pretext to bring in total
[10:57.240 --> 11:02.080]  martial law now I've seen their preparation I've seen their propaganda
[11:02.080 --> 11:06.240]  and I've said over and over again when they start saying look for nukes to go
[11:06.240 --> 11:14.120]  off in New York City or DC that means that they are seriously preparing to
[11:14.120 --> 11:18.720]  either a allow someone some radical group who they've given a weapon to
[11:18.720 --> 11:23.840]  through a third party to attack or do it themselves now that does not mean the
[11:23.840 --> 11:28.400]  guy from the post office is involved or your average FBI agent is involved or
[11:28.400 --> 11:32.400]  even the average person in the Defense Department it means a very small
[11:32.400 --> 11:37.960]  criminal network a nuke is perfect because two or three people can be given
[11:37.960 --> 11:43.040]  it by their clandestine controllers and then they can roll it out put it in a
[11:43.040 --> 11:48.400]  basement of a house and then detonate it by remote control via satellite or
[11:48.400 --> 11:55.560]  however radio or via timer and have absolute plausible deniability jacket
[11:55.560 --> 12:03.280]  the weapon in isotopes that will then finger it to a Russian or South African
[12:03.280 --> 12:10.080]  or Iranian or North Korean Providence once that happens they get to strike
[12:10.080 --> 12:15.120]  their enemies overseas they get to start a war that will get people to
[12:15.120 --> 12:23.240]  domestically line up in a primitive militant enthusiasm system of basic
[12:23.240 --> 12:31.160]  animal psychology behind their leader Obama then domestically they will be
[12:31.160 --> 12:37.080]  able to strike out at their enemies and pass through their entire agenda if I
[12:37.080 --> 12:40.720]  was then I would simultaneously carry out mass shootings at shopping malls
[12:40.720 --> 12:45.760]  schools and government facilities that have already been hardened to roll out
[12:45.760 --> 12:50.040]  the next phase of the attack claiming that domestic groups using the nuke
[12:50.040 --> 12:57.480]  attack angry about martial law struck out at the government and that leads us
[12:57.480 --> 13:01.680]  before we play this clip of Obama again to the report still at drudge report
[13:01.680 --> 13:07.880]  calm on the right hand side of the screen also in the featured news top
[13:07.880 --> 13:13.120]  story archive right hand side of info wars calm halfway down you can see this
[13:13.120 --> 13:18.000]  article from yesterday with the hundred-plus page leaked confirmed we
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.560]  called the numbers on it folks it's it's it's homeland security it's FEMA where
[13:23.560 --> 13:30.120]  they train to quote take on online dissent and those criticizing three
[13:30.120 --> 13:40.640]  things quote socialism tyranny and martial law those criticizing socialism
[13:40.640 --> 13:45.960]  and tyranny under martial law are to be targeted during the military takeover
[13:45.960 --> 13:49.880]  now that's the thing about something this big people say we find out about it
[13:49.880 --> 13:52.280]  we'd know
[13:52.280 --> 14:01.240]  they had national level exercise in leo 9 this is in le 14 the last time it was
[14:01.240 --> 14:06.320]  declassified was 2011 and it said troops from 15 nations and tabletop
[14:06.320 --> 14:11.440]  exercises with their commanders prepared to aid north com in suppression of
[14:11.440 --> 14:17.040]  civil unrest and quote domestic terrorism that was on FEMA dot gov remember
[14:17.040 --> 14:21.440]  that well this is in leo 14 that says it's not even to be given to people in
[14:21.440 --> 14:25.720]  the FBI and homeland security unless they're at the highest command level
[14:25.720 --> 14:30.920]  let's put it back up on screen this given to oathkeepers confirmed and given to

[15:20.200 --> 15:23.160]  you guys bring me that printout over here to the side of the building thank
[15:23.160 --> 15:25.640]  you very much I know they're listening over there on the TV side of the

[15:57.800 --> 16:03.200]  well they train to battle online but also physically this document deals
[16:03.200 --> 16:06.880]  with online those who they see as terrorists who are going to criticize
[16:06.880 --> 16:16.320]  martial law and the implementation of a quote socialist tyranny I want to
[16:16.320 --> 16:21.400]  explain something here that is absolutely fundamental and at the heart of
[16:21.400 --> 16:26.600]  everything we face in the last 20 years mainstream state-run media has
[16:26.600 --> 16:31.280]  completely discredited itself and destroyed itself when I was a child
[16:31.280 --> 16:35.320]  make you mainline news would report on government drug dealing torture rings
[16:35.320 --> 16:40.040]  corruption the government couldn't get away with one-tenth of what they do now
[16:40.040 --> 16:44.760]  because the establishment was scared of tyranny and even though they were
[16:44.760 --> 16:48.320]  running things and corrupt they didn't want a total tyranny to come in because
[16:48.320 --> 16:53.480]  that would upset the entire system and would endanger their positions liberty
[16:53.480 --> 16:58.080]  produces prosperity so the elite wanted to skim off the top they were smart I'm
[16:58.080 --> 17:02.640]  not endorsing what they did but they were not one-tenth as bad as this current
[17:02.640 --> 17:07.200]  elite that wants it all wants it now like Hitler and Napoleon they're going
[17:07.200 --> 17:10.640]  for broke they want to dominate their opposition it's about dominating their
[17:10.640 --> 17:16.360]  opposition not about even being in power bad for business I'm gonna tell you
[17:16.360 --> 17:22.320]  here is the big inch a lot of folks when you look at this they got the mainstream
[17:22.320 --> 17:27.400]  media to totally whore themselves out and destroy themselves on every single
[17:27.400 --> 17:34.280]  front and now you notice CNN MSNBC are just going to cooking shows the systems
[17:34.280 --> 17:36.840]  done with them they're not even needed anymore now they're moving on to
[17:36.840 --> 17:39.800]  entertainment to put propaganda out there they've always done that but now
[17:39.800 --> 17:44.800]  it's intensifying and becoming more naked when they're done with you they
[17:44.800 --> 17:51.040]  throw you away they destroy the media institution while they're pouring it
[17:51.040 --> 17:57.000]  out and the same thing goes for the police as you're federalized as you're
[17:57.000 --> 18:00.040]  trained and given the power to kill whoever you want get away with it as
[18:00.040 --> 18:06.120]  you're corrupted that's done so your institutions that were never perfect but
[18:06.120 --> 18:08.920]  were a lot better in the past undoubtedly by every metric can be
[18:08.920 --> 18:12.440]  discredited and destroyed to have a night of the long knives and get rid of
[18:12.440 --> 18:16.320]  the essay and bring in the SS later to use a German Nazi German
[18:16.320 --> 18:22.320]  analogy from 1933-1934 this is the pattern humans do the same thing over
[18:22.320 --> 18:27.680]  and over again this is the the logic of globalist controllers this is the logic
[18:27.680 --> 18:35.160]  of tyranny this is the logic of these systems the dark logic the wicked logic
[18:35.160 --> 18:40.280]  it's their signature their modus operandi and criminology they do the

[24:45.400 --> 24:50.080]  New York we have the CBS News article that came out hours after we broke the
[24:50.080 --> 24:54.760]  story with Senator Lindsey Graham saying that if we don't attack Iran remember
[24:54.760 --> 24:58.440]  back during the whole Syria thing three months ago that nukes would go off in
[24:58.440 --> 25:06.040]  New York or in the Carolinas Charleston to be specific

[25:25.800 --> 25:32.760]  I'm telling you the big move the coup d'etat in this country the number one
[25:32.760 --> 25:38.760]  weapon they've got is a nuke going off that has been jacketed in a isotope to
[25:38.760 --> 25:42.840]  fingerprint it to a foreign power you blackmail the foreign power you want to
[25:42.840 --> 25:45.760]  attack just like they did Iraq with 9-11 when it was out of Saudi Arabia
[25:45.760 --> 25:51.680]  clearly undoubtedly and you go after whoever you want and they've just kicked
[25:51.680 --> 25:58.400]  Russia out of the g8 that is a big deal I told you last year that my spidey
[25:58.400 --> 26:02.680]  sense was off the chart and now this year it's beyond off the chart but you
[26:02.680 --> 26:07.880]  don't need spidey sense ladies and gentlemen to know this is serious and
[26:07.880 --> 26:12.840]  all I want prosperity all I want to process all I want a future I don't
[26:12.840 --> 26:16.720]  want the globalists who are hellbent to get our guns break this country and turn
[26:16.720 --> 26:21.520]  us into their military arm completely and to finally capture the US the
[26:21.520 --> 26:24.520]  globalists just don't want to capture Russia they've already got the US
[26:24.520 --> 26:29.320]  partially captured but they want it fully captured they want to secure their
[26:29.320 --> 26:33.720]  rear-guard homeland and the globalists want to punish their political enemies
[26:33.720 --> 26:38.880]  and they're training the military and the police secretly but we've blown it
[26:38.880 --> 26:44.680]  wide open so now it's public to take us on that's treason
[26:44.680 --> 26:50.520]  George Soros is financing banning guns here he's financing attacking Russia over
[26:50.520 --> 26:52.680]  there
[26:52.680 --> 26:57.000]  Bill Clinton's pushing attack in Russia over there pushing taking our guns and
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.440]  our kids here
[26:59.440 --> 27:03.840]  MSNBC's pushing attacking Russia over there they're pushing taking our kids and
[27:03.840 --> 27:10.280]  our guns here they sow division they sow racism they sow control look at them
[27:10.280 --> 27:15.200]  turn them on it's an enemy globalist banker propaganda channel like
[27:15.200 --> 27:21.960]  Dilligan Rattigan told you and I'm sitting here saying all this I can't
[27:21.960 --> 27:25.800]  believe I'm saying it it's totally true it's totally public and I wish it was a
[27:25.800 --> 27:29.920]  lie I wish it wasn't this crazy here's the Department of Homeland Security I'll
[27:29.920 --> 27:33.200]  show you a document again shot federal emergency management agency national
[27:33.200 --> 27:42.320]  exercise program capstone exercise 2014 scenario ground truth cyber attacks are
[27:42.320 --> 27:45.360]  expected throughout the exercise the numbers of anti-government organizations
[27:45.360 --> 27:49.120]  such as free Americans against socialist tyranny an individual sympathetic to
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.600]  their cause and then it goes on for page after page how they're going to take on
[27:53.600 --> 27:57.440]  the people that are against the tyranny during martial law uses the words
[27:57.440 --> 28:06.320]  martial law in here this is what they train for martial law and who do they
[28:06.320 --> 28:11.160]  go after the people that are aware of their operation I mean we're living in
[28:11.160 --> 28:16.000]  a V for V for Vendetta movie ladies and gentlemen but it's not a movie let's go
[28:16.000 --> 28:19.960]  to the Lord and Savior and he will be our Lord and Savior when the newt goes
[28:19.960 --> 28:24.960]  off it'll turn him into Kim Jong-un he will be our Savior when the newt goes
[28:24.960 --> 28:32.440]  off and I just can't believe it the fact that they're pushing all this right
[28:32.440 --> 28:36.320]  now means they're seriously thinking about either letting somebody do it or
[28:36.320 --> 28:39.840]  doing it themselves and it's so easy with the newt because you can only use a
[28:39.840 --> 28:43.400]  very small number of people who of course are gotten rid of later let's go
[28:43.400 --> 28:51.480]  ahead and go to that tape and so my response then continues to be what I
[28:51.480 --> 28:57.000]  believe today which is Russia's actions are a problem they don't pose the number
[28:57.000 --> 29:01.960]  one national security threat to the United States I continue to be much more
[29:01.960 --> 29:09.080]  concerned when it comes to our security with the prospect of a nuclear weapon
[29:09.080 --> 29:15.120]  going off in Manhattan which is part of the reason why the United States showing
[29:15.120 --> 29:21.280]  its continued international leadership has organized a forum over the last
[29:21.280 --> 29:26.160]  several years that's been able to help eliminate that threat in a consistent
[29:26.160 --> 29:31.040]  alright so they're at the Hague the seat of global governance global government
[29:31.040 --> 29:34.320]  and they're announcing the new move against Russia and the American
[29:34.320 --> 29:37.640]  Patriots it's not that Russia is perfect something American Patriots are
[29:37.640 --> 29:41.840]  perfect it's just that we are not part of the new world order so they're coming
[29:41.840 --> 29:45.800]  after us we're gonna come back and continue to break this down ladies and
[29:45.800 --> 29:49.520]  gentlemen but I hope we can get the word out and stop this we stop the Syrian

[34:20.360 --> 34:26.360]  everything I will ever be in my family name I believe the globalist are
[34:26.360 --> 34:31.000]  seriously considering setting nuclear weapons off in this country and blaming
[34:31.000 --> 34:35.600]  it on foreign enemies and domestic enemies and doing a total sweep I've
[34:35.600 --> 34:41.440]  told you this year after year and you see them now pushing it and saying
[34:41.440 --> 34:46.600]  domestic groups are connected to the foreigners just as I told you I know the
[34:46.600 --> 34:53.680]  enemy's mind it's simple strategy I would do the same thing if I was animated
[34:53.680 --> 35:00.360]  by their force I am able as anyone is that focuses and studies something long
[35:00.360 --> 35:09.600]  enough to predict what they're going to do because I know them and I watch their
[35:09.600 --> 35:16.600]  propaganda and there's so many data points that I cannot even begin to tell
[35:16.600 --> 35:21.080]  you how much grave danger we're in now for every action there's an equal and
[35:21.080 --> 35:31.400]  opposite reaction as I perseverate quoting the physicist Einstein Albert
[35:31.400 --> 35:39.280]  Einstein but that goes back to even Newton but Einstein repeated it in larger
[35:39.280 --> 35:45.160]  equations but Newtonian physics are clear and if there's any laws in this
[35:45.160 --> 35:55.800]  universe at this level of consciousness we know these are laws and the fact that
[35:55.800 --> 36:00.320]  they're considering doing this and bringing in full martial law that's
[36:00.320 --> 36:03.640]  their emergency backup they don't want to do that the fact that they're looking
[36:03.640 --> 36:08.560]  at this and now testing it with trial balloons beta testing with the public
[36:08.560 --> 36:20.320]  means they are in deep trouble on every single front 99% of people in the FBI are
[36:20.320 --> 36:29.200]  not part of this 99% of people in the CIA are not part of this 99% of people in
[36:29.200 --> 36:33.480]  your local state police are not part of this a lot of them may be part of other
[36:33.480 --> 36:42.100]  corruptions but very few I'd say 99.99999 are not involved in plans to set
[36:42.100 --> 36:46.800]  off thermal nuclear weapons in this country or an atomic bomb they built to
[36:46.800 --> 36:59.880]  make it look like it came from the Iranian moolas or the Russians I told
[36:59.880 --> 37:06.480]  you Stuxnet day one was the Israelis turned out it was I've told you over
[37:06.480 --> 37:12.800]  and over again I told you Pierce Morgan would get a once a month magazine show
[37:12.800 --> 37:18.040]  with famous people like Frost that's what he got how do I know this not because
[37:18.040 --> 37:26.520]  I'm even that smart as a hunter as a Jaeger as a man I can watch what
[37:26.520 --> 37:32.120]  different creatures different animals different people different weather
[37:32.120 --> 37:37.160]  systems do and they do the same thing over and over again in similar patterns
[37:37.160 --> 37:45.840]  so I know what the enemy that I hunt does I live studying the enemy I am the
[37:45.840 --> 37:53.160]  enemy I have studied the enemy so long I am the enemy you understand that I am
[37:53.160 --> 38:01.320]  what I hunt call me the hunter that's my name and you too ladies and gentlemen
[38:01.320 --> 38:05.600]  can learn how the enemy operates and let me tell you if you learn how they
[38:05.600 --> 38:09.640]  operate you're now going to be wearing the sunglasses just like rowdy rowdy
[38:09.640 --> 38:15.920]  Piper and they live listener of the show and he said the real world's just like
[38:15.920 --> 38:21.720]  that movie you put on the glasses there ain't no going back and what does rowdy
[38:21.720 --> 38:26.000]  Piper have to do to his friend to make him put the glasses on he's got to get
[38:26.000 --> 38:29.640]  in a serious battle with him and both of them have to get hurt really bad
[38:29.640 --> 38:34.920]  before they learn the truth and that's the analogy or the allegory of how you
[38:34.920 --> 38:40.560]  have to go through hell to learn things don't you wish you just put the glasses
[38:40.560 --> 38:49.640]  on or start eating concrete put these glasses on where you're gonna start
[38:49.640 --> 38:55.400]  eating concrete and I'm gonna do this to you because I love you you think it's
[38:55.400 --> 38:59.200]  fun to get up here and talk about these people that may set nukes off in the
[38:59.200 --> 39:03.040]  country I'm only alive because my grandmother's praying for me ladies and
[39:03.040 --> 39:06.560]  gentlemen I'm only alive because if they destroy me it'll turn me into a
[39:06.560 --> 39:11.160]  martyr but they'll probably figure something out and that's why I get so
[39:11.160 --> 39:16.640]  upset and so angry when I'm on air folks because I literally realize I am
[39:16.640 --> 39:22.160]  putting myself in the arena with vicious evil people and my family is
[39:22.160 --> 39:26.960]  being put in the arena like chips all in on a poker table and I don't like it
[39:26.960 --> 39:31.880]  but I got to do it and that's why the adrenaline starts flowing the chills
[39:31.880 --> 39:36.360]  start going up down my spine because I see the enemy I got the glasses on and I
[39:36.360 --> 39:40.160]  just wish the public could see it for themselves our country has been captured
[39:40.160 --> 39:48.160]  our country has been overrun get to get that special report on the cops killing
[39:48.160 --> 39:51.320]  the killing the homeless guy ready for me I'm gonna have to go to go to that for
[39:51.320 --> 39:58.000]  a while because it's so important the full reports up on info wars com and then
[39:58.000 --> 40:02.640]  I'll come back in and all this with Greg Palastin war it's just that everything
[40:02.640 --> 40:06.040]  is set up for them to stage stuff and poses the saviors and the nukes the way
[40:06.040 --> 40:10.800]  to go to start the foreign war to cover up the derivative scam and clamp down
[40:10.800 --> 40:14.400]  domestically and I'm telling you I know what they got in their hand I know
[40:14.400 --> 40:19.280]  where the ace card set because I saw him tip their hand earlier and they got
[40:19.280 --> 40:22.960]  their finger on the ace card looking me in the eyes looking you in the eyes
[40:22.960 --> 40:27.000]  getting ready to play it they are really considering playing the ace of
[40:27.000 --> 40:35.720]  spades it's the only God they need is stage terror the only way you beat them is
[40:35.720 --> 40:43.080]  exposing their secret weapon exposing their do sex exposing their God of
[40:43.080 --> 40:56.120]  stage problem-reaction solution Higelian dialectic you got to be blind to not see
[40:56.120 --> 41:01.640]  open tyranny being set up around us in a criminal takeover of the Republic and the
[41:01.640 --> 41:06.440]  big story about these police that killed this poor man is that I had only seen
[41:06.440 --> 41:10.520]  Sunday when my buddy Shane Steiner sent me a clip of it the Albuquerque news
[41:10.520 --> 41:13.440]  where they start shooting him and they cut right when they pull the trigger I
[41:13.440 --> 41:17.080]  said to the guys yesterday before the show I said you know I bet there's a raw
[41:17.080 --> 41:23.760]  version put out by you know the court they found it online folks and the story
[41:23.760 --> 41:26.440]  isn't that they shot the guy for no reason he didn't have knives in his
[41:26.440 --> 41:30.840]  hands like they said we blew up the video it's that they flashbang him let a
[41:30.840 --> 41:35.680]  dog attack him he turns to run and then they shoot him in the back and you can
[41:35.680 --> 41:39.880]  hear him on the audio I don't know it translates over a.m. radio but you hear
[41:39.880 --> 41:44.640]  him going I can't move they shot him right in the back he's paralyzed and then
[41:44.640 --> 41:47.960]  they start shooting more and step on him and then put him in handcuffs as he dies
[41:47.960 --> 41:52.320]  and they're clearly getting off on it like wolves they've just taken down a
[41:52.320 --> 41:56.960]  bear and it's just some homeless guy now they show up with I mean usually it's
[41:56.960 --> 42:00.800]  one cop with a homeless person and or come on down here and you wait a few
[42:00.800 --> 42:03.960]  hours they don't come down or wherever you don't want to kill them but they're
[42:03.960 --> 42:08.120]  hiring people we know 10 15 20% of the military historically are psychopathic
[42:08.120 --> 42:11.600]  killers who want to get in because they want to kill people legally most to get
[42:11.600 --> 42:15.040]  in because of family reasons or because they're honorable because his men they
[42:15.040 --> 42:18.880]  need to go out and be in combat because it's genetically there they're very
[42:18.880 --> 42:23.840]  honorable good people but the police departments are recruiting people who and
[42:23.840 --> 42:28.840]  this is what they want who really want to hurt and kill people I mean I got to
[42:28.840 --> 42:32.200]  say the Austin Police Department for all its problems is not trying to recruit
[42:32.200 --> 42:37.560]  people that just want to kill people and you know if you really want to kill
[42:37.560 --> 42:41.400]  people why don't you be a man about it and go join the military and try to get
[42:41.400 --> 42:45.440]  into special forces and actually go fight real people that shoot back not
[42:45.440 --> 42:50.780]  homeless people it is the most dishonorable weak thing to find some
[42:50.780 --> 42:55.440]  naked homeless 14-year-old who clearly is autistic looking at their hands and
[42:55.440 --> 42:59.400]  you see these squad car videos where they beat them to death oh you didn't
[42:59.400 --> 43:02.960]  follow my order taser you oh you're flopping around I'm gonna beat you I
[43:02.960 --> 43:08.400]  mean who wants to beat an autistic person to death or throw someone out of a
[43:08.400 --> 43:13.560]  wheelchair a an animal that's it and I want to explain something the police
[43:13.560 --> 43:16.240]  we're gonna skip this network break and play this I want to explain something
[43:16.240 --> 43:19.480]  to the police as they hear this I'm playing this so you can kick these
[43:19.480 --> 43:23.120]  type of people out of your ranks so we can get rid of these bad department heads
[43:23.120 --> 43:27.640]  Albuquerque's legendary for tasering women and you know what and eight anal
[43:27.640 --> 43:31.560]  exams you know people at a traffic stop and torturing people to death I mean
[43:31.560 --> 43:37.560]  it's a very evil department moth hog on steroids runs it and we either change
[43:37.560 --> 43:40.680]  this and decide which side you're on are you discredit yourself your family
[43:40.680 --> 43:45.800]  prosperity all this type of stuff it's unnatural to let the system do things
[43:45.800 --> 43:49.480]  like this and we will turn into a total tyranny under this and then you will
[43:49.480 --> 43:54.320]  lose everything as well so let's go to this report we have the unedited audio
[43:54.320 --> 43:59.960]  and video warning it is it is the dog is biting him after he's already been
[43:59.960 --> 44:06.600]  shot repeatedly with real bullets and beanbags and I mean and the cops are
[44:06.600 --> 44:09.880]  hyperventilating like they're actually scared and it turns out this guy wasn't
[44:09.880 --> 44:16.160]  feared and didn't have any you know violent record or anything and it's just
[44:16.160 --> 44:20.440]  they went up there playing soldier you know I saw on my phone this morning I
[44:20.440 --> 44:25.280]  screen-shotted it I saw on YouTube somebody explained it all absolutely
[44:25.280 --> 44:30.680]  perfectly off the video I put out last night on the nightly news let me see if
[44:30.680 --> 44:37.000]  I screen-shotted that I did screenshot that Michael Gorman said well you pump up
[44:37.000 --> 44:40.720]  low IQ goons that's what they try to hire now under a hundred IQ arm them with
[44:40.720 --> 44:44.040]  high-tech weapons and tell them they are saviors put them in roaming packs so
[44:44.040 --> 44:48.160]  they affirm each other's power you were asking for brutality and mayhem what a
[44:48.160 --> 44:54.240]  murderous bunch of thugs these guys are that's it it's mob psychology let's go
[44:54.240 --> 44:57.320]  ahead and go to this special report because remember this is what the global
[44:57.320 --> 45:02.120]  is to put in across the country under the threat fusion centers and the training
[45:02.120 --> 45:07.120]  while they prepare to stage the false flag to totally take over and then cops
[45:07.120 --> 45:10.280]  you're not going to get away with this in the Civil War you're meant to be
[45:10.280 --> 45:13.960]  destroyed in the Civil War so hopefully you have some self-preservation
[45:13.960 --> 45:18.440]  instincts in you because you will be destroyed in this war let's go ahead and
[45:18.440 --> 45:20.840]  go to this video
[45:23.960 --> 45:30.640]  man standing behind boulder walks out they detonate flashbang release dog to
[45:30.640 --> 45:40.360]  begin biting him in the genitals James M. Boyd is dead his crime sleeping behind
[45:40.360 --> 45:48.200]  a line of boulders at a state park outside Albuquerque New Mexico a group
[45:48.200 --> 45:52.960]  of heavily armed police with a German Shepherd attack dog came upon him and
[45:52.960 --> 45:58.600]  ordered him to walk down the hill when he began to come down the hill we're
[45:58.600 --> 46:03.360]  going to go through the unedited footage they released the police dog on
[46:03.360 --> 46:08.440]  him throw a flashbang grenade at him he turns to run pulls something out of his
[46:08.440 --> 46:11.680]  pockets and they shoot him in the back
[46:20.800 --> 46:25.480]  now we pause the video there where the suspect James Boyd appears to be turning
[46:25.480 --> 46:30.800]  away from officers and now that's all the public has seen up until that point
[46:30.800 --> 46:35.480]  the mainstream media stops the video right there when they pull the trigger
[46:35.480 --> 46:40.320]  and shoot him in the back what comes next is the true horror they allow the
[46:40.320 --> 46:44.880]  dog to chew and continue to bite on him they step on his arms they shoot him
[46:44.880 --> 46:49.300]  more with the beanbag guns and it looks like they shoot him with a real
[46:49.300 --> 46:56.440]  firearm at least one more time they then handcuff his dead body and hyperventilate
[46:56.440 --> 47:02.280]  acting like they're scared of him and so it's okay what they've done when you
[47:02.280 --> 47:08.080]  look at this in context it's bad enough but when you see all the other things
[47:08.080 --> 47:12.880]  they've done in Albuquerque New Mexico and gotten away with like pepper spraying
[47:12.880 --> 47:19.240]  a woman's genitalia to quote punish her or giving a man eight anal probes and
[47:19.240 --> 47:24.280]  enemas looking for illegal drugs they never found from a routine traffic stop
[47:24.280 --> 47:29.600]  you realize what a dangerous place Albuquerque is to visit and then you
[47:29.600 --> 47:35.560]  find out there is a long train of very suspicious cases of police killing
[47:35.560 --> 47:40.360]  people and calling it suicide in Albuquerque and the surrounding counties
[47:40.360 --> 47:45.880]  you realize this is another one of these boss hog kingdoms where the police know
[47:45.880 --> 47:51.640]  they're above the law watching the footage is extremely disturbing and
[47:51.640 --> 47:56.440]  we're gonna play it all unedited from end to end for you right now this was
[47:56.440 --> 48:01.640]  shot from a gun camera that one of the police officers has and when you see
[48:01.640 --> 48:07.160]  this man talking to them calmly and seconds later he's dead you realize
[48:07.160 --> 48:11.800]  how dangerous this militarization of police has become the New York Times
[48:11.800 --> 48:15.800]  The Wall Street Journal they've all reported now on what I began warning you
[48:15.800 --> 48:22.160]  about 19 years ago the federalization and the militarization of police under
[48:22.160 --> 48:28.600]  the Rand Corporation National Stability Police Force Plan which is designed to
[48:28.600 --> 48:38.040]  turn our country into a martial law system
[48:58.600 --> 49:05.600]  I'm worried about safety. I'm not a fucking murderer.
[49:05.600 --> 49:07.600]  I'm trying to harm you.
[49:11.600 --> 49:14.600]  Get on the ground! Get on the ground now!
[49:14.600 --> 49:17.600]  Get on the ground! Get on the ground!
[49:17.600 --> 49:19.600]  Don't make fun of me.
[49:19.600 --> 49:22.600]  Move it up!
[49:25.600 --> 49:27.600]  Move it up!
[49:30.600 --> 49:32.600]  Moving up!
[49:37.600 --> 49:40.600]  Now they release the dog on the guy who's shot in the back.
[49:40.600 --> 49:42.600]  He's not moving.
[49:42.600 --> 49:44.600]  Get your hands out!
[49:44.600 --> 49:49.600]  Let him say I can't move. He's paralyzed.
[49:49.600 --> 49:53.600]  Get your hands up. We only shot you in the back.
[49:53.600 --> 49:55.600]  So they shoot him a bunch.
[49:55.600 --> 49:59.600]  With a 12 gauge beanbag at about 15 feet away that'll kill you.
[49:59.600 --> 50:02.600]  And that does kill him.
[50:02.600 --> 50:05.600]  That's three times on the spine with a beanbag gun.
[50:05.600 --> 50:07.600]  I can do them on him.
[50:07.600 --> 50:09.600]  Yeah, I don't want that knife in his head.
[50:09.600 --> 50:12.600]  Yeah, yeah we just killed somebody.
[50:12.600 --> 50:15.600]  He's still alive. They'll let the dog bite him some.
[50:15.600 --> 50:18.600]  Come on, let the dog have a little fun too.
[50:19.600 --> 50:21.600]  There you go.
[50:21.600 --> 50:23.600]  Bite his leg. Good, good.
[50:23.600 --> 50:25.600]  Step on that right hand real hard.
[50:25.600 --> 50:27.600]  Step on that right hand real hard.
[50:27.600 --> 50:29.600]  You got knife in each hand?
[50:29.600 --> 50:30.600]  Knife in each hand. Knife in each hand.
[50:30.600 --> 50:32.600]  It's blood on the rock where his face bashed.
[50:33.600 --> 50:35.600]  I got left.
[50:35.600 --> 50:41.600]  They treat him like an animal. They'll be treated like that.
[50:41.600 --> 50:44.600]  I'm going to switch you.
[50:44.600 --> 50:46.600]  Let's put him in handcuffs.
[50:46.600 --> 50:47.600]  You got lethal right there?
[50:47.600 --> 50:49.600]  Yes, I have lethal.
[50:50.600 --> 50:53.600]  These guys are all really excited right now.
[50:53.600 --> 50:56.600]  They're all going to have bad car wrecks.
[50:56.600 --> 50:58.600]  The kids are going to get cancer.
[50:58.600 --> 51:00.600]  This is how it works. I've seen it.
[51:00.600 --> 51:03.600]  I know those cops are going to watch this later and laugh.
[51:03.600 --> 51:06.600]  You'll be laughing later because you know who you got to deal with.
[51:06.600 --> 51:09.600]  You heard that Johnny Cash song?
[51:09.600 --> 51:12.600]  You can run on for a long time.
[51:12.600 --> 51:14.600]  Run on for a long time.
[51:14.600 --> 51:16.600]  Sooner or later.
[51:18.600 --> 51:21.600]  These are all wannabe soldiers.
[51:22.600 --> 51:24.600]  Because it's unedited tape.
[51:24.600 --> 51:26.600]  We cut off some of the firsts.
[51:26.600 --> 51:28.600]  We're going to shoot you if you don't come down.
[51:28.600 --> 51:30.600]  Nobody needs to get hurt. I'm fine.
[51:30.600 --> 51:32.600]  Blah, blah, blah. I'm going to come down.
[51:32.600 --> 51:34.600]  They were so scared of him.
[51:34.600 --> 51:36.600]  There's his evil camp.
[51:36.600 --> 51:38.600]  Oh my gosh, this is so evil.
[51:38.600 --> 51:40.600]  A homeless guy.
[51:40.600 --> 51:42.600]  Let's tear through his belongings.
[51:42.600 --> 51:44.600]  We're already taking his life.
[51:44.600 --> 51:46.600]  Let's try to find something so we can incriminate him.
[51:46.600 --> 51:48.600]  Oh, I'm too bad they didn't find anything.
[51:48.600 --> 51:50.600]  That letter came out and they dig through us.
[51:50.600 --> 51:52.600]  He won't need to do that anymore.
[51:52.600 --> 51:54.600]  I'm good here.
[51:54.600 --> 51:56.600]  Got his bottled water.
[51:56.600 --> 51:58.600]  Radio.
[51:58.600 --> 52:01.600]  This is just a little man out there.
[52:01.600 --> 52:03.600]  We're going to open them.
[52:03.600 --> 52:05.600]  Out there with the rattlesnakes.
[52:05.600 --> 52:07.600]  Looks like about three miles from the houses.
[52:07.600 --> 52:09.600]  All right.
[52:09.600 --> 52:11.600]  Our country is converting to tyranny.
[52:11.600 --> 52:13.600]  The police are being given the power
[52:13.600 --> 52:15.600]  of judge, jury, and executioner.
[52:15.600 --> 52:17.600]  We've seen cases where the police shoot
[52:17.600 --> 52:19.600]  the young black man in the back
[52:19.600 --> 52:21.600]  while he's handcuffed for no reason.
[52:21.600 --> 52:23.600]  The bullet bounces back up into his heart,
[52:23.600 --> 52:25.600]  shooting him twice.
[52:25.600 --> 52:27.600]  Then after what appears to be a struggle,
[52:27.600 --> 52:29.600]  a Bart officer puts his knee to Grant's neck
[52:29.600 --> 52:31.600]  and head, and another officer steps back,
[52:31.600 --> 52:33.600]  draws his gun and fires it once
[52:33.600 --> 52:35.600]  into Grant's back.
[52:35.600 --> 52:37.600]  And we see so many other cases
[52:37.600 --> 52:39.600]  where the police
[52:39.600 --> 52:41.600]  execute people.
[52:41.600 --> 52:43.600]  We know in the military
[52:43.600 --> 52:45.600]  most people join because of family
[52:45.600 --> 52:47.600]  or because of patriotism
[52:47.600 --> 52:49.600]  and a desire to serve.
[52:49.600 --> 52:51.600]  But we know a minority.
[52:51.600 --> 52:53.600]  Criminology states about 15 percent
[52:53.600 --> 52:55.600]  get in because they legally
[52:55.600 --> 52:57.600]  want to kill people
[52:57.600 --> 52:59.600]  in a psychopathic fashion,
[52:59.600 --> 53:01.600]  simply to kill people.
[53:01.600 --> 53:03.600]  Police forces are the exact same thing.
[53:03.600 --> 53:05.600]  And once you get psychopaths in them,
[53:05.600 --> 53:07.600]  they begin recruiting others
[53:07.600 --> 53:09.600]  and you get a culture of psychopaths.
[53:09.600 --> 53:11.600]  Now, these police are either
[53:11.600 --> 53:13.600]  psychopaths or,
[53:13.600 --> 53:15.600]  this is more common, they are so scared
[53:15.600 --> 53:17.600]  and taught instinctive shooting
[53:17.600 --> 53:19.600]  that it's all about
[53:19.600 --> 53:21.600]  a cult of their safety.
[53:21.600 --> 53:23.600]  So they will shoot first and ask questions later.
[53:23.600 --> 53:25.600]  You see them attacking homeless people,
[53:25.600 --> 53:27.600]  shooting autistic children,
[53:27.600 --> 53:29.600]  attacking old people, folks in wheelchairs,
[53:29.600 --> 53:31.600]  just a crazed attitude of
[53:31.600 --> 53:33.600]  you will do what I say,
[53:33.600 --> 53:35.600]  you will respect my authority.
[53:35.600 --> 53:37.600]  You see the dog gnawing on this guy.
[53:37.600 --> 53:39.600]  You see the police dog biting on him
[53:39.600 --> 53:41.600]  after he's been shot repeatedly.
[53:41.600 --> 53:43.600]  You see them stepping on him
[53:43.600 --> 53:45.600]  and then handcuffing him
[53:45.600 --> 53:47.600]  after he's clearly been killed.
[53:47.600 --> 53:49.600]  And finally, you see the police chief defending it
[53:49.600 --> 53:55.600]  from the police.
[53:55.600 --> 53:57.600]  The public knows
[53:57.600 --> 53:59.600]  and everyone can watch the footage
[53:59.600 --> 54:01.600]  that this is the extermination
[54:01.600 --> 54:03.600]  of a man
[54:03.600 --> 54:05.600]  who's homeless camping behind a rock.
[54:05.600 --> 54:07.600]  More and more Americans are going homeless,
[54:07.600 --> 54:09.600]  more and more people are going bankrupt
[54:09.600 --> 54:11.600]  and it is frightening to see
[54:11.600 --> 54:13.600]  this man and others
[54:13.600 --> 54:15.600]  like in the case of Kelly Thomas
[54:15.600 --> 54:17.600]  being tortured to death by police
[54:17.600 --> 54:19.600]  for the crime of sleeping outside
[54:19.600 --> 54:47.600]  at night.
[54:47.600 --> 54:49.600]  Even the most ignorant
[54:49.600 --> 54:51.600]  of the American people know
[54:51.600 --> 54:53.600]  that we're becoming an authoritarian police state,
[54:53.600 --> 54:55.600]  that the checks and balances are being removed.
[54:55.600 --> 54:57.600]  We all know North Korea
[54:57.600 --> 54:59.600]  is a horrible authoritarian dictatorship
[54:59.600 --> 55:01.600]  based on a police state.
[55:01.600 --> 55:03.600]  We know Mexico is,
[55:03.600 --> 55:05.600]  we know Nigeria is,
[55:05.600 --> 55:07.600]  we know Saudi Arabia is,
[55:07.600 --> 55:09.600]  but our government won't even criticize
[55:09.600 --> 55:11.600]  those regimes anymore
[55:11.600 --> 55:13.600]  like Saudi Arabia
[55:13.600 --> 55:15.600]  because tyranny is now
[55:15.600 --> 55:17.600]  a policy worldwide.
[55:17.600 --> 55:19.600]  Europe's converting to tyranny.
[55:19.600 --> 55:21.600]  England's converting to it. We're converting to it.
[55:21.600 --> 55:23.600]  It's happening all
[55:23.600 --> 55:25.600]  over the world
[55:25.600 --> 55:27.600]  and it is the most dangerous threat to humanity.
[55:27.600 --> 55:29.600]  Governments killed 262 million people
[55:29.600 --> 55:31.600]  in the 20th century.
[55:31.600 --> 55:33.600]  The number one cause of death is government.
[55:33.600 --> 55:35.600]  Our founders
[55:35.600 --> 55:37.600]  said that it is the number one danger.
[55:37.600 --> 55:39.600]  George Washington said
[55:39.600 --> 55:41.600]  government is like fire, a dangerous servant,
[55:41.600 --> 55:43.600]  a fearful master. It's time to rediscover
[55:43.600 --> 55:45.600]  that common sense
[55:45.600 --> 55:47.600]  and to get the police and the government
[55:47.600 --> 55:49.600]  and the system and the bureaucrats
[55:49.600 --> 55:51.600]  back under control.
[55:51.600 --> 55:53.600]  The only reason the police are being given
[55:53.600 --> 55:55.600]  this much power and allowed to get away with
[55:55.600 --> 55:57.600]  what I believe is clearly cold-blooded execution
[55:57.600 --> 55:59.600]  is because
[55:59.600 --> 56:01.600]  the power structure wants
[56:01.600 --> 56:03.600]  to have this paramilitary force in place
[56:03.600 --> 56:05.600]  to oppress the people.
[56:05.600 --> 56:07.600]  And that's on record. The drones, the NSA,
[56:07.600 --> 56:09.600]  the taser drones,
[56:09.600 --> 56:11.600]  the citizen spies. This is not
[56:11.600 --> 56:13.600]  what a free society is about.
[56:13.600 --> 56:15.600]  Liberty brings prosperity.
[56:15.600 --> 56:17.600]  Terranny is going to bring
[56:17.600 --> 56:19.600]  bondage and poverty.
[56:19.600 --> 56:21.600]  It's not too late to start valuing human life again.
[56:21.600 --> 56:23.600]  It's not too late
[56:23.600 --> 56:25.600]  to say no to the new world order.
[56:25.600 --> 56:27.600]  It's not too late to rediscover
[56:27.600 --> 56:29.600]  the Renaissance, the Magna Carta,
[56:29.600 --> 56:31.600]  the Bill of Rights, the Constitution
[56:31.600 --> 56:33.600]  and Western Civilization.
[56:33.600 --> 56:35.600]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off
[56:35.600 --> 56:37.600]  for InfoWars.com,
[56:37.600 --> 56:39.600]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars
[56:39.600 --> 56:41.600]  back to David Knight.
[56:41.600 --> 56:43.600]  And that is from
[56:43.600 --> 56:45.600]  The Nightly News. Last night,
[56:45.600 --> 56:47.600]  7 o'clock weeknights
[56:47.600 --> 56:49.600]  and we are only able to bring you this
[56:49.600 --> 56:51.600]  hardcore, beyond-cutting edge
[56:51.600 --> 56:53.600]  battering ram of liberty
[56:53.600 --> 56:55.600]  information because of all your support over the years.
[56:55.600 --> 56:57.600]  And I appreciate your prayers.
[56:57.600 --> 56:59.600]  I appreciate
[56:59.600 --> 57:01.600]  your support. And I appreciate
[57:01.600 --> 57:03.600]  the good police,
[57:03.600 --> 57:05.600]  FBI, Federal Marshall,
[57:05.600 --> 57:07.600]  state police, local police
[57:07.600 --> 57:09.600]  around the country that have given us
[57:09.600 --> 57:11.600]  so much accurate intel.
[57:11.600 --> 57:13.600]  In fact, it's almost everything
[57:13.600 --> 57:15.600]  I've ever been given by our sources has turned out to be
[57:15.600 --> 57:17.600]  real and accurate.
[57:17.600 --> 57:19.600]  There's not even that many bad people
[57:19.600 --> 57:21.600]  in the system.
[57:21.600 --> 57:23.600]  It's that the bad
[57:23.600 --> 57:25.600]  is generally close to the top and is
[57:25.600 --> 57:27.600]  allowed to operate with impunity because
[57:27.600 --> 57:29.600]  all the good men do nothing. All the good women
[57:29.600 --> 57:31.600]  do nothing, as our founder said.
[57:33.600 --> 57:35.600]  So
[57:35.600 --> 57:37.600]  we need to change this
[57:37.600 --> 57:39.600]  hunter-killer-seeking-destroy policy
[57:39.600 --> 57:41.600]  of if some guy turns the runaway
[57:41.600 --> 57:43.600]  you shoot him and kill him and then let a police
[57:43.600 --> 57:45.600]  dog bite him and then get
[57:45.600 --> 57:47.600]  off on it because these guys play too much
[57:47.600 --> 57:49.600]  call of duty.
[57:49.600 --> 57:51.600]  Before I end this hour, speaking of supporting
[57:51.600 --> 57:53.600]  the broadcast, you can get 11
[57:53.600 --> 57:55.600]  memberships for $5.95 a month and share

[58:17.600 --> 58:19.600]  Nathan I and I in proprietary, the fluoride
[58:19.600 --> 58:21.600]  shield, detoxifier that doesn't just take out
[58:21.600 --> 58:23.600]  the fluoride but a lot of heavy metals and things.
[58:23.600 --> 58:25.600]  The new super silver bullet,
[58:25.600 --> 58:27.600]  the little silver we developed, the strongest
[58:27.600 --> 58:29.600]  out there, folks, go check out the write-up on it.
[58:29.600 --> 58:31.600]  And it's not for regular use, by the way.
[58:31.600 --> 58:33.600]  It's pretty much emergency use. Consult your physician.
[58:33.600 --> 58:35.600]  Everything we bring out is super high-powered.

[58:49.600 --> 58:51.600]  Introducing Pro 1.

[58:53.600 --> 58:55.600]  system, portable on the go.
[58:55.600 --> 58:57.600]  No more do you have two or three filters
[58:57.600 --> 58:59.600]  to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[58:59.600 --> 59:01.600]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride,
[59:01.600 --> 59:03.600]  and up to 95%
[59:03.600 --> 59:05.600]  of hydrofluorosilic acid,
[59:05.600 --> 59:07.600]  advanced manufacturing technology
[59:07.600 --> 59:09.600]  combines silver impregnated white
[59:09.600 --> 59:11.600]  ceramic with new aqua medics
[59:11.600 --> 59:13.600]  advanced media, a removal
[59:13.600 --> 59:15.600]  of fluoride and other heavy metals, all
[59:15.600 --> 59:17.600]  in one filter element. It is the only
[59:17.600 --> 59:19.600]  one that does it and out of the gates,

[59:25.600 --> 59:27.600]  one unit helps reduce
[59:27.600 --> 59:29.600]  or remove pesticides, herbicides,
[59:29.600 --> 59:31.600]  chloramines, ammonia
[59:31.600 --> 59:33.600]  and chlorine, hydrofluorosilic acid,
[59:33.600 --> 59:35.600]  the most common form of fluoride
[59:35.600 --> 59:37.600]  not covered by other fluoride filter
[59:37.600 --> 59:39.600]  brands, and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:17.600]  I love how Donald
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.600]  Rumsfeld is giving Obama
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:21.600]  right cover.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:23.600]  When Obama is basically continuing
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.600]  the globalist neocon policies
[01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.600]  that they adopted from
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.600]  Zbigniew Brzezinski and the Democrats.
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.600]  That's if you know history.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.600]  Singin' ass news, Rumsfeld,
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.600]  U.S. ties with Karzai gone downhill
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:37.600]  like a toboggan under Obama.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.600]  He goes on to sing
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:41.600]  like a toboggan under Obama.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:43.600]  He goes on to sing
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.600]  like a toboggan under Obama.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.600]  He goes on to say a trained ape
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:49.600]  could do a better job
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.600]  at war than Obama.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.600]  Can you imagine if somebody else other
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.600]  than Rumsfeld said that they would say
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.600]  that they're claiming that it's racist?
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.600]  Truth is that's
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.600]  a classic saying regardless
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.600]  of race to say a trained monkey
[01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:05.600]  could do a better job.
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:07.600]  But the whole point is
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:09.600]  that's not even true. Obama just helped
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.600]  the EU and NATO
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.600]  get 93% of Ukraine
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.600]  fomenting a revolution
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.600]  of ultra-Hitlerian
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:19.600]  right wing to overthrow
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.600]  the elected government.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.600]  Russia seized its military bases
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:25.600]  and pipelines and it's been dealt a huge
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:27.600]  defeat. And weapons systems
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.600]  are being run right up to their border now.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.600]  They've been kicked out of the G8
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.600]  and they spin this
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.600]  like all that matters is America's winning.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.600]  So politically, oh Obama's
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.600]  losing. Oh look
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.600]  he
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.600]  didn't do a good job.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.600]  Oh look
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:49.600]  Karzai is talking about about him.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.600]  Oh look
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.600]  he's an idiot. Which then
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.600]  makes the left come and defend Obama
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.600]  and go oh see the right wings attacking him.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:59.600]  This is literal
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:01.600]  good cop
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.600]  bad cop garbage.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.600]  And again they want to condense it down to
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:09.600]  Georgia versus Pepsi, Chevy versus Ford.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.600]  I'm sick of it. I'm tired of this mindlessness.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.600]  It's either you're for America
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.600]  or you're for Russia. No, I'm against
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.600]  the EU and George Soros destabilizing
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.600]  the whole region to start a new Cold War.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.600]  I don't endorse the stuff the Russian government's
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.600]  up to. But you know what, they're not in my life.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.600]  They're not trying to take my guns.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.600]  Georgie Boy is
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.600]  Georgie Boy's trying to kill the dollar.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.600]  Georgie Boy is funding anti-family
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.600]  movements. Georgie Boy
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.600]  I wonder why he was behind drug decriminalization
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.600]  and I've now discovered the reason. I don't know
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.600]  everything folks, far from it.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.600]  I watch, I research, I figure things out.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.600]  Now I know
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.600]  I've been looking at these state laws
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.600]  on the medical marijuana.
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.600]  You waive your rights and become a ward
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:55.600]  of the state basically
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.600]  and become basically a new criminal
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.600]  or welfare class
[01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.600]  when you go on, even if you pay for it
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:03.600]  they are inducting you into a system
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:05.600]  as a drug head
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.600]  and taking your kids and taking your guns
[01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:09.600]  and harassing you
[01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:11.600]  and so
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.600]  I mean I say just keep the things illegal
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.600]  and you know they've reduced the sentences down
[01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:17.600]  to almost nothing. I mean just I
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:19.600]  I mean if I was, if I had glaucoma
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:21.600]  or I had a stomach problem, I had to smoke it.
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.600]  I don't like plot folks, I'm on record.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.600]  I mean I've smoked it but didn't inhale
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.600]  like Bill Clinton was joking.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.600]  No I've inhaled, let me tell you
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.600]  and I don't like it.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.600]  I don't like stimulants either
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:37.600]  unless it's like coffee. I like mild stimulants
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.600]  I like alcohol, I like tobacco
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.600]  that's the
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.600]  pantheon of my drug
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.600]  taking world
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:47.600]  but
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.600]  it's unbelievable how slick these people are
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.600]  they can take anything
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.600]  and turn it into a screw job
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.600]  and you know
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.600]  Obama's been trying to keep mandatory sentences
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:01.600]  for pot while acting like
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.600]  he's pro marijuana legalization
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.600]  when they've tripled the rage
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.600]  on the states where they don't make you a war
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.600]  to the state.
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.600]  Oregon and California don't make you a war to the state
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.600]  and so they're swat teaming them
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.600]  until they pass laws the feds like
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:19.600]  they just turn you into an invalid of the state
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.600]  like Michigan and others
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.600]  and the Colorado law is so confusing I can't
[01:04:25.600 --> 01:04:27.600]  even understand it
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.600]  and believe me folks if I can't read a law
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.600]  and understand it and have to go to a lawyer to understand it
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:33.600]  we got a problem.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.600]  Alright ladies and gentlemen we're going to be right back
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.600]  with Greg Palast
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.600]  to get into what's going on with all these bankers suicides
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:41.600]  because we pulled me that Bloomberg for yesterday thanks
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.600]  Obama I want to say something here on here
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:45.600]  I really had the realization
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:47.600]  that I've got an incredible crew
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.600]  and they just get better and better
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:51.600]  and they all love liberty
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.600]  this is the best crew I've had in 18 years
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.600]  I salute you guys out there
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.600]  because I didn't have a crew 18 years ago
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:26.600]  I had Buckley that was in
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.600]  and that's why I stock my pantry
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.600]  with high quality storeable foods

[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:11.600]  for more than a decade
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.600]  my favorite coffee has come from
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:15.600]  the high mountains of southern Mexico
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.600]  where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.600]  shade grown Arabica beans
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:21.600]  we have now managed to secure
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.600]  a highly customized blend

[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:39.600]  hands down this is my favorite coffee
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.600]  and it's taken us years to secure connections
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.600]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.600]  drop by the site today

[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.600]  the facts are in
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.600]  the studies are legion
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.600]  sodium fluoride and other toxic members
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.600]  of the fluoride family are devastating
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.600]  the health and cognitive ability of the American people
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.600]  so why are the social engineers
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:13.600]  adding it to the water
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.600]  simple dumb down the host
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.600]  population that the parasitic
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.600]  technocracy is feeding on
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.600]  we may not have been able to get fluoride
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.600]  out of the water supply yet but we can
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:25.600]  help to get it out of our bodies
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:27.600]  I am extremely excited to announce
[01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:29.600]  the exclusive infowarslife
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.600]  fluoride shield formulation
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.600]  fusing six of the best documented ingredients
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.600]  from around the world
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.600]  to help the body remove not just toxic
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:39.600]  fluoride residues from the body
[01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:41.600]  but a whole host of toxic substances
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:43.600]  let's take a stand against the globalist
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:45.600]  by blocking their poisons with fluoride
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.600]  I use fluoride shield every day

[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:55.600]  let's start cleansing our bodies now
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:57.600]  and support the info war at the same time
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:25.600]  that's infowarslife.com
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:27.600]  there's a room of other patriots out there
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.600]  to fight this tyranny
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.600]  we're at this broadcast, you out there
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.600]  all the other patriots that love liberty
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:35.600]  and love justice
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:37.600]  all the other real media out there
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.600]  that's fighting for freedom
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.600]  we're being hit by a very
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.600]  sophisticated globalist takeover
[01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.600]  but once people are aware of the attack profile
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:47.600]  we're able to turn it back around
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.600]  unprecedented folks to have Obama
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:51.600]  if you just joined us
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.600]  I'm going to play this for Greg Palace
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:55.600]  saying his number one threat is a terrorist
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.600]  going off of New York
[01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.600]  that'd be the perfect way to take control
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.600]  of this country and start a war with Russia
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.600]  and he said it in the same line
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:05.600]  talking about Russia
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:07.600]  and here's the headline, Russia is ousted from
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.600]  group of 8 by US and allies
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:11.600]  Russia has been trying to reform
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.600]  Putin obviously
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.600]  is a quasi-dictator
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.600]  he gets elected but it's kind of like Bloomberg
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.600]  because he controls the situation
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.600]  but the point is
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.600]  Russia was not expanding
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:25.600]  Russia was not starting a bunch of wars
[01:09:25.600 --> 01:09:27.600]  I'm not romanticizing
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.600]  I'm not saying they're an angel
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:31.600]  but trying to do all this over a small annexation
[01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.600]  when the EU and the bankers
[01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.600]  just took over 93% of the country
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.600]  financing a coup d'etat
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.600]  with Soros and others involved
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.600]  and the Russians kind of grabbed their area
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.600]  I'm surprised the Russians didn't grab half the country
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.600]  and I'm not defending what the Russians are doing
[01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.600]  it's just this is what happens
[01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.600]  Stalin grabs half a Poland
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.600]  the other half
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.600]  or vice versa
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.600]  history repeats
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.600]  and you see Spain going for
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.600]  independence
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.600]  areas of Spain, Catalonia
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.600]  you see Venice voting
[01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.600]  80-something percent for splitting off
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.600]  you see all these other countries
[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:09.600]  you see Scotland voting
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:11.600]  to get out of the UK
[01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:13.600]  are we talking about sending battleships
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.600]  or aircraft carriers there, missile cruisers
[01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:17.600]  and
[01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.600]  people use the term Nazi too much
[01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:21.600]  but the Ukrainians
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:23.600]  in the western side were pro-Nazi in World War II
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:25.600]  and they really
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:27.600]  have put people in as the vice president
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:29.600]  the rest of it who actually are on video
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.600]  Highling-Hitler and stuff
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:33.600]  we've shown you that
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.600]  it is a horrible situation
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:37.600]  why are they kicking off a new Cold War
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:39.600]  why is
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.600]  Bloomberg reporting, like we've been reporting for a year
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:43.600]  that bankers death
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.600]  shine light on stress in industry
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.600]  they've
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:49.600]  changed the headline
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:51.600]  guys pull it out of the stack from yesterday
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.600]  in yesterday's stack
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:55.600]  we have the Bloomberg headline where it says
[01:10:55.600 --> 01:10:57.600]  coroners looking into deaths
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:10:59.600]  and now they've memory-holded that and changed it
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.600]  so they're looking at stress in the industry
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.600]  very very interesting that they've done that
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.600]  because it is the same article
[01:11:05.600 --> 01:11:07.600]  and it's a lot of
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:09.600]  people jumping out of buildings or being found dead
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:11.600]  and I think some of them are being killed
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.600]  in the next hour
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.600]  or 50 minutes that we've got left
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.600]  with Greg Palast, investigative journalist
[01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.600]  par excellence
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.600]  I want to
[01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.600]  get his take on the waterfront
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:25.600]  and the anniversary of the Exxon Valdez
[01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.600]  I want to get his take
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.600]  on other investigations
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:31.600]  that he is
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:33.600]  part of
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.600]  that is just
[01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:37.600]  some of what we're going to be
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.600]  breaking down with him
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.600]  but clearly they're turning the fear meter up
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.600]  as Obama's approval rating goes down
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:45.600]  remember the same special interest that run
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.600]  the Republican leadership
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:49.600]  clearly they're starting a new cold war
[01:11:49.600 --> 01:11:51.600]  now with kicking the Russians out of the
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.600]  G8 unprecedented
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:55.600]  that will only hurt the people of the EU, the US
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.600]  and Russia
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:59.600]  and just allow more inside groups
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.600]  to kleptocratically control where trade
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.600]  is allowed
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.600]  it's really simply amazing
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:07.600]  to have this going on
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.600]  Gregpalast.com's his website
[01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.600]  he's a selling author
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.600]  he's an investigative journalist
[01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:15.600]  and he writes for Vice Magazine, The Observer
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:17.600]  and of course
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.600]  he's a stranger to this broadcast
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.600]  he's been coming on for about 15 years
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.600]  and he of course is the host of
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.600]  News Night one of the biggest shows
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.600]  over in England with the BBC as well
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600]  but he has to come on shows like mine here in the US
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.600]  because there's such a wall of censorship
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.600]  in dinosaur media
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.600]  but I wanted to get his take
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.600]  as a geopolitical traveler
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.600]  to stop federal
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.600]  fraud investigator
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.600]  with the Justice Department
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.600]  on what we're seeing happen
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.600]  in the different power blocks because
[01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.600]  this is a big deal what I see happening
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:51.600]  this new violent reset
[01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.600]  with Russia
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.600]  and I want to see from his study
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.600]  the players involved if he agrees
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.600]  or
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:01.600]  if he can augment or disagree
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:03.600]  with the gestalt I threw out about the new geopolitical
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.600]  reset that's happening
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:07.600]  towards a new cold war
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.600]  and where he sees this going and tying it
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:11.600]  into the banker deaths then we'll look
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.600]  at a bunch of other issues
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.600]  and his latest book that's out
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.600]  Greg thank you for coming on today
[01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:19.600]  glad to be with you Alex
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:21.600]  good points to be making
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.600]  it's worth the discussion
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.600]  and we're on the investigation I have to say
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:27.600]  one of our team just
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:29.600]  came back from the Ukraine Zach Roberts
[01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:31.600]  and one of the
[01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:33.600]  members of our team is Ukrainian
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:35.600]  and I can't use his name
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.600]  so we have so we
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.600]  are covering the Ukrainian story
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.600]  as well as obviously
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.600]  I'm on because it's the 25th anniversary
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.600]  of the ExxonLD's another investigation
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:47.600]  not completely separated because we're talking
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.600]  about oil and banking
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:51.600]  and that's what Ukraine comes out
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.600]  you're either talking about oil or banks
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:55.600]  that's about the end of the discussion
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.600]  on the geopolitical front
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.600]  in the Ukraine
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.600]  in fact
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.600]  if you want me to throw in my two cents
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:05.600]  of where our investigation's gone so far
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.600]  I'm happy to do that
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:09.600]  yes sir
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:11.600]  well on the Ukraine
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:13.600]  understand that this started
[01:14:13.600 --> 01:14:15.600]  when the Ukrainian government
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:17.600]  under Yanukovych who's an ethnic Russian
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.600]  as are a little more than half
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.600]  the people there
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:23.600]  he was faced
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.600]  with basically a demand
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:27.600]  for a takeover a hostage
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:29.600]  taking by the banks of the west
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:31.600]  the central bank
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:33.600]  and the IMF
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.600]  said if you want to join the European trade
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:37.600]  pact here's what you have to do
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:39.600]  you have to sell us cheap gas
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.600]  trans shipped from Russia
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.600]  you have to privatize that
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:45.600]  is turnover all your industry
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.600]  you have to go through a massive austerity program
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.600]  which is going to cripple
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.600]  unemployment
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.600]  basically they wanted to do the Greece job
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.600]  on Ukraine they're going to turn into another Greece
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:57.600]  and if you want to trade with Europe
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.600]  here's the price
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.600]  and the reason they wanted to open to Europe
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:03.600]  is that they were hoping that maybe some people
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.600]  were hoping eventually they'd join the EU
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.600]  which would allow them to leave Ukraine
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.600]  and move to Germany
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.600]  and England that was the hook
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.600]  but if you want to connect to Europe
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.600]  to Western Europe
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:17.600]  basically you have to turn over your industries
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.600]  throw another million people
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:21.600]  out of work minimum
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:23.600]  literally they're going to literally
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.600]  literally crank up massive unemployment
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:27.600]  so Putin
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:29.600]  not being a bad chess player
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.600]  said oh well since
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.600]  they're putting the squeeze
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.600]  on Ukraine I'll make them a counter offer
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:37.600]  here's $15 billion
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.600]  and cheap heating gas
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:41.600]  for your people
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:43.600]  no strings attached
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.600]  except that you join
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:47.600]  our trade pact
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.600]  not the IMF European
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:51.600]  World Trade Organization
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.600]  pact and so obviously
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.600]  the one which was
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.600]  punishment and the other which was
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.600]  $15 billion free money
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.600]  Yanukovych took the free money
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.600]  from Russia that led to the West
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.600]  engineering
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.600]  a push
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:09.600]  against the elected president
[01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:11.600]  we're supposed to be afraid of that
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:13.600]  the weirdest thing people are talking about
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.600]  supporting democracy in Ukraine
[01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.600]  they overthrew an elected president
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.600]  this new game that people go
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:21.600]  on the streets and overthrow elected presidents
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:23.600]  we saw this in Thailand
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.600]  we're seeing this in Venezuela
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.600]  where the 1% is going out in the street
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.600]  and trying to overturn elections
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.600]  that's what happened in
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:33.600]  Ukraine and I gotta tell you
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.600]  Zach came back from Kiev
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.600]  two weeks ago with pictures
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.600]  from the demonstrations and like you say
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.600]  not everyone's a Nazi, not everyone's a fascist
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.600]  but we have pictures
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.600]  of the pretend storm troopers
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:47.600]  the swastikas
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.600]  it is
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.600]  it's not very pretty, it looks like
[01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:53.600]  1933
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:55.600]  well your analysis is exactly like mine
[01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.600]  because we're not reading from the same sheet of music
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.600]  that's what's going on
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:01.600]  but then you turn on the news
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.600]  wonderful freedom fighters and they're burning
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.600]  buildings and burning police
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.600]  and shooting police that have done nothing
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.600]  overthrowing the government and then Russia
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.600]  and I'm not romanticizing Russia but they grab
[01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:13.600]  an area that's always been part of Russia
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.600]  in the past where they've had a bunch of wars
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.600]  the Crimean war, they grab their military bases
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.600]  their naval base, their gas pipelines
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:21.600]  and
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.600]  you would think they'd started World War 3
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:25.600]  now they're kicking them out of the G8
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.600]  Obama's worried about nukes going off
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:29.600]  this sounds like they're trying to start a new cold war
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:31.600]  yeah
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.600]  I mean obviously you gotta keep
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.600]  the cold war is very effective in controlling
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.600]  the American people and
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:39.600]  our leaders and the elite
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.600]  really miss it
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.600]  you know like the banks can't impose
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:45.600]  they can't terrorize you into giving up your rights
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.600]  they need
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.600]  some type of boogeyman out there and Putin
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.600]  he looks like a hitman
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.600]  from central casting and he
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.600]  believed me he kind of is he's no sweetheart
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.600]  but Crimea is Russian
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.600]  you know if we believe
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.600]  that the Ukraine had the right
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.600]  to vote to free itself
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:05.600]  from the Soviet Union then how come
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.600]  the same right isn't afforded to Crimea
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:09.600]  in fact we've demanded that
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.600]  Russia and Russia's agreed
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.600]  to hold a referendum nearby
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.600]  in Chechnya
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.600]  next year
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:19.600]  where they get to vote whether to leave Russia
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:21.600]  so on one hand we're saying
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:23.600]  you can say that if the people
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.600]  want to leave Russia they can
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:27.600]  and the Russians have agreed to that vote
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:29.600]  but now the Crimeans want to join their Russians
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.600]  they want to join their fellow Russians
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.600]  and by the way they get a nice deal out of it
[01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:35.600]  because they get better pensions
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.600]  by becoming Russians
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.600]  again
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.600]  suddenly that's anti-democratic
[01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.600]  we just supported the creation of South Sudan
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.600]  which is already didn't even take one year
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.600]  for that to turn into a cannibalistic war
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.600]  you know so it's
[01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:51.600]  you know but again I agree
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.600]  this is part of the creation of a new cold war
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.600]  because now we need you know we don't have
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.600]  communists there now we have
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.600]  Putin and you know so we have
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.600]  to create the Russian bear again
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:03.600]  is threatening New York
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.600]  well I'm here in New York I've looked down 2nd Avenue
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.600]  and I haven't seen
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.600]  red army tanks rolling down the street
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.600]  what I see is a lot of
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.600]  unemployed people who are hoping to
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.600]  are begging the bankers walking by
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:17.600]  for extra quarters well that's right
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:19.600]  I want to come back and get into the latest
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:21.600]  banker escapades
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.600]  and then I want to shift gears in 25 years
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:25.600]  Exxon Valdez how that ties to BP
[01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.600]  you're breaking news on that front
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:29.600]  and I want to ask you about the banker suicides
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.600]  when we come back so we're going to come back to
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.600]  Greg Palace right after
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.600]  this quick break
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.600]  here is the headline out of Bloomberg
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.600]  they changed it
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.600]  banker deaths leave industry concerned as coroners probe
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.600]  and they've now changed it today
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:45.600]  to this we'll show folks a document
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:47.600]  cam of that when we come back

[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.600]  Silver has always

[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:56.600]  Ukraine's nine-to-long knives, curtain-emo, students suspended for shaving head in support of cancer patient.
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:58.600]  Man, they attack on free speech in this country.

[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.600]  That's going super viral.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:12.600]  They're already all over the mainstream news criticizing him for saying it,
[01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:16.600]  so that's broken big time with our reporter Dan Badandi in Rhode Island.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.600]  Uncensored video, police execute homeless man for camping.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.600]  It's unbelievable.
[01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.600]  Ukraine leader leaked recording.
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:27.600]  8 million Russians in Ukraine must be killed with nuclear weapons.
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.600]  That's just some of the reports up on infowars.com.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:35.600]  And it's shocking and sensational because reality is sensational.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.600]  We need to stop filtering what's really going on.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:41.600]  And a sensational reporter breaking so many huge stories is Greg Palast.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.600]  Greg, what do you know?
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:46.600]  I don't know one who's got more investigative connections than you.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:51.600]  And the numbers of bankers and comp-trollers and key management people
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:56.600]  that would be involved in cover-ups, these are key risk analysis certifiers.
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:01.600]  As a top fraud investigator, do you think this is all suicides or could there be foul play?
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.600]  I'm not going to say word, Alex.
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:06.600]  I'm a little of an investigation.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:12.600]  I'm an investigative reporter, so until the investigation's done, I can't report.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:16.600]  Just remember, we have a mass, a trillion dollar fraud that was uncovered,
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.600]  the LIBOR fraud.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.600]  That is when you get your adjustable rate mortgages,
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:24.600]  when you get anything that's involved with an adjustable rate,
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:30.600]  that involves what's called the London Interbank Overnight Rate.
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:34.600]  That's behind all the interest rates and that's set by a private group of bankers.
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:36.600]  It's not some type of government agency.
[01:26:36.600 --> 01:26:38.600]  It's not a computer algorithm.
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:41.600]  It's about eight guys who get together in a room and say what our interest rates will be tomorrow morning.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.600]  That's what I'm looking at.
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.600]  Where I've gotten with it, I can't say because I haven't gotten far enough yet,
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:51.600]  but when I report it, you'll be the first to know.
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:56.600]  Wow, so you are hot on the trail, Greg Palast, right now of this.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.600]  Do we have any number on how many it is?
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:00.600]  It's in the dozens and dozens now.
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:06.600]  One of the problems statistically is that people do kill themselves
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:09.600]  and people do get knocked off for all kinds of reasons.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:11.600]  But there's certainly a big uptick right now.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:15.600]  So even if they're not being murdered, what are they depressed about?
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:18.600]  Well, that's what we're trying to investigate.
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:19.600]  That's where we have to go.
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.600]  We've got so many investigations going on now.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.600]  It's one of the trails we're trying to pick up.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:25.600]  So like I said, so many stories to report.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.600]  I'm always afraid to talk about anything in the middle of an investigation
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:31.600]  where I don't have all the facts in front of me.
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:35.600]  You know me, I'm Mr. Here's the Documents Guy.
[01:27:35.600 --> 01:27:37.600]  So I'm going to stick with those right now.
[01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.600]  I want to come back and get into 25 years after Exxon Valdez,
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:41.600]  but the three minutes we've got in this short segment,
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.600]  long one coming up, Greg Palast,
[01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:46.600]  what's the biggest banker story right now?
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:48.600]  I mean, they're doing so much.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.600]  Wow.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:55.600]  Well, I would say that right now, the big bank story is really going back
[01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:57.600]  to the foreclosure crisis.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:02.600]  We had a bunch of banks who were selling predatory mortgages.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.600]  You know, the line that's being used in the media is that
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.600]  4 million people who lost their homes.
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:10.600]  Oh, they got those loans, and they couldn't afford them.
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:13.600]  Well, they could afford them when they got them at 4%.
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.600]  Somehow, as interest rates are dropping,
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:17.600]  people's adjustable rate mortgages,
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:19.600]  and many people listening this will recognize this
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.600]  in their own bills that they're getting monthly,
[01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.600]  somehow are going from 4% to 11%.
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:26.600]  Their monthly payments are doubling and tripling.
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:27.600]  Now, I don't care who you are.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:30.600]  The average American, if your payment for your home triples,
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:32.600]  you are going to lose your home.
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:35.600]  And in places like Detroit where the industry,
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:38.600]  like the auto industry collapsed, you're going to lose your home.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:41.600]  But the problem was, these were predatory mortgages,
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:45.600]  these subprime mortgages, and anyone who tried to attack this system,
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:48.600]  these were given out by Bank of America's countrywide unit.
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.600]  In fact, the head of the countrywide unit, this guy, Mozilla,
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:56.600]  became Bank of America's unit, and he was a shill for them.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.600]  The guy earned $600 million.
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:01.600]  Now, I want to say, and not his company.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:05.600]  He personally, selling these criminal mortgages,
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.600]  earned $600 million.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:11.600]  He didn't spend an afternoon in prison.
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:17.600]  J.P. Morgan issued billions of dollars in predatory mortgages.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:20.600]  That's a crime under federal law.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:23.600]  And all I know is that instead of jail time,
[01:29:23.600 --> 01:29:29.600]  Jamie Dimon has been to the White House about 90 times to talk to
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:33.600]  Mr. Obama called Jamie Dimon his favorite banker.
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.600]  So let's start there.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:37.600]  I want to hear about that because you were reporting on this first.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.600]  Now it's just confirmed they all committed crimes.
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:40.600]  No one's gotten trouble.
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.600]  M.F. Global, John Corzine.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.600]  I want to look at it all, then get into the latest breaking news you've got,
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:30:00.600]  and Exxon Valdez, new breaking news there on the anniversary.

[01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:51.600]  and sodium hexafluorosilicate.

[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:05.600]  In the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:11.600]  based with the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:14.600]  Guess what else is in the halogen family? Fluoride.
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:16.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.600]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:22.600]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:25.600]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:31.600]  and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:34.600]  in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:35.600]  Iodine is important.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:38.600]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base,
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:42.600]  nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:11.600]  She's all alone, all alone in a time of need
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:15.600]  Because he's racing and racing and plotting the course
[01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:18.600]  He's fighting and fighting and lining on his horse
[01:33:18.600 --> 01:33:31.600]  He's going the distance
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:36.600]  No trophy, no flowers, no flashbolts, no line
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:39.600]  He's haunted by something he cannot define
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.600]  Bowl shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.600]  I sail him and bail him with monster truck force
[01:33:44.600 --> 01:33:46.600]  Monday through Friday

[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:57.600]  With the Sunday edition of the M.F.Wars News Transmission
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:00.600]  We're going back to Greg Palace in a moment to get into all
[01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:03.600]  He's always got a bunch of breaking news at GregPalace.com
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.600]  And tie it into the 25th anniversary of Exxon Valdez
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.600]  The BP Spell
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:10.600]  And other stories he's had on the trail of
[01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:15.600]  But first off, remember this hour is brought to you by MyPatriotSupply.com

[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:50.600]  Not even so much with sponsorship
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:53.600]  I like to go the way of just knowing that we promote the best
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.600]  Gravity-fed filters out there
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:59.600]  The Pro Pure 2.0, G2, cuts out the glyphosates
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:04.600]  The cancer-growing chemicals that are given to us by the Loving Monsanto
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.600]  The fluoride, all of it
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:11.600]  And the Pro1s blow away all major gravity-fed filter competition
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:14.600]  And we carry some of the other brands as well
[01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:17.600]  I'm just telling you for the price, Pro1 is the best deal on the site
[01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:19.600]  It's what I use
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:24.600]  InfoWarsStore.com or call toll-free, 888-253-3139
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:27.600]  You know, just get clean water that's so essential to everything
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.600]  As General Jack T. Ripper says
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.600]  And Dr. Strangelove, they're trying to corrupt our precious bodily fluids
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.600]  I'm being sarcastic, but I'm not
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.600]  The point is, is that you can go to the site
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:39.600]  Get a great deal on great filtration systems
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:41.600]  And make the show possible
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:44.600]  All of this is because we started to build it in U.K.
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.600]  And it's not about left, it's not about right
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:48.600]  It's about liberty, it's about truth, it's about justice
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:51.600]  It's about what's the reality geopolitically
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:53.600]  What's the reality culturally
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.600]  What's the right thing to do
[01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.600]  What will bring us prosperity
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:00.600]  And real sustainability
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:03.600]  So again, we have the Wake of America coffee
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:05.600]  It's probably 15 years ago that I started drinking
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.600]  Chiapas coffee
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.600]  And then I found suppliers down in southern Mexico
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:12.600]  Directly to the farmers, the Chiapas
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:15.600]  Farmers up in the mountains, the organic
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.600]  Volcanic grown
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:19.600]  And leading coffee like this is 30, 40, 50%
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.600]  Sometimes double
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:23.600]  I know the Starbucks has the same coffee from Chiapas
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.600]  It's about double the cost of it
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:27.600]  We have it per pound, we have two different blends
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:29.600]  This is my favorite coffee
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:31.600]  It's a strong, bold blend, organic
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:34.600]  I like it, most people get it and say it's their new favorite
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.600]  Or they agree it's excellent coffee
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.600]  It's 17.95 a pound
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.600]  And your purchase supports the broadcast
[01:36:40.600 --> 01:36:42.600]  Wake up America, Patriot Blend, Jones for it
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:44.600]  And we have the immune support

[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.600]  Okay, Greg, I've been ranting
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:24.600]  I want to give you the floor in the next 14 minutes or so
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:26.600]  I want you to really break down
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.600]  Where do you see geopolitically the world?
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:30.600]  Are things getting better?
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:31.600]  Is it getting worse?
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:33.600]  Is the wake up to the banker occupation
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.600]  Coming along well?
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.600]  I mean, if this was a football game
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:39.600]  Team humanity versus team kleptocrat
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:41.600]  Where are we?
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:43.600]  And then I want to tie it into things like the Exxon Valdez
[01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:46.600]  Which ties into things like nuclear disasters
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.600]  Like Chernobyl that got covered up
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:51.600]  And now the situation with Fukushima
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:53.600]  There's this corporate culture
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:56.600]  Of just thinking they can suspend the rules of reality
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:37:58.600]  And who cares what happens to everybody
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:01.600]  Including their children?
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.600]  Well, you got it, Alex. First of all, I'm not too worried
[01:38:03.600 --> 01:38:05.600]  You're here, I'm here
[01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:07.600]  You're keeping your eye out
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.600]  And, you know, the world hasn't changed
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:14.600]  You know, we've been going on since Rome
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:18.600]  You know, the fight over who controls the coinage
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:21.600]  So, you know, banks, resources
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:24.600]  Hell, we had fights over whale oil
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.600]  A century and a half ago
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:28.600]  So, you know, it's back and, you know
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:30.600]  It's always going to be back and forth
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:32.600]  It's always going to be, you know, patriots
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:34.600]  And people fighting for liberty
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:37.600]  Versus the guys with, you know, with the big rocks
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.600]  They're going to try to break your skull in
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:41.600]  That's a general view, but let me go back
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:43.600]  Actually, let's put a couple things together
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.600]  We're talking just before about the bankers
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:50.600]  We have a trillion dollar, trillion dollar fraud
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:52.600]  Trillion dollar fraud
[01:38:52.600 --> 01:38:54.600]  And again, I say this as a fraud expert, you know
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:56.600]  That's what my job was with the Justice Department
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.600]  Now I'm out as an investigative reporter
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.600]  For the Guardian BBC
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.600]  We've got trillion dollar fraud
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:06.600]  In the London Interboro Bank rate scandal
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.600]  Which covers everything from your credit card
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:11.600]  To your auto payments to your mortgage
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:14.600]  There's no straight interest rate charged right now
[01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:16.600]  It's a con, it's a fraud
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:18.600]  And it's a multi-trillion dollar deal
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:20.600]  Now, at the center of it
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:23.600]  One of the big centers of it is J.P. Morgan
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:26.600]  As I said, Obama calls the head of J.P. Morgan
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:28.600]  Jamie Dimon
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:31.600]  In fact, when America, when you and I as taxpayers
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:34.600]  Gave 20 billion dollars to J.P. Morgan in a bailout
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:40.600]  And then Dimon paid himself a big fat bonus
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:42.600]  And everyone screamed, Obama said
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:45.600]  Oh, why is everyone upset with Jamie Dimon?
[01:39:45.600 --> 01:39:47.600]  Why should he be punished?
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.600]  The answer, Mr. President, if you don't know
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:51.600]  Why Jamie Dimon should be punished
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:53.600]  Then you should get out of the Oval Office
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:55.600]  Here's the problem
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:58.600]  I'm going to tell you about the Exxon Valdez
[01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:00.600]  I'm going to tell you about the Deepwater Horizon
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:03.600]  And that goes directly to J.P. Morgan in the Oval Office
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.600]  Last week, the Obama administration said that
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:09.600]  BP, which had destroyed the Gulf of Mexico
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:13.600]  Operated like a rogue pirate operation
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.600]  Killed 11 men, incinerated them on the Deepwater Horizon
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:20.600]  The Obama administration has now said
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:22.600]  That they can drill in the Gulf
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:24.600]  And in fact, they gave them a new tract
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:27.600]  To drill in the Gulf right near the Wakanda Well
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.600]  Where the Deepwater Horizon sank
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.600]  Now, why would they do that?
[01:40:31.600 --> 01:40:33.600]  Who owns British Petroleum?
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:36.600]  The answer is J.P. Morgan
[01:40:36.600 --> 01:40:39.600]  So if we're going to bail out J.P. Morgan
[01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.600]  If J.P. Morgan is our president's favorite banker
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:44.600]  As he calls them
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:48.600]  Then you can't sink BP because that sinks J.P. Morgan
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:51.600]  So, you know, people are shocked at BP
[01:40:51.600 --> 01:40:54.600]  I mean, if you dropped oil and burnt down
[01:40:54.600 --> 01:40:56.600]  Your apartment in a building
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:58.600]  You think you'd be getting a new lease?
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.600]  That's what they're doing here
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:04.600]  Now, let me go back 25 years to the Exxon Valdez
[01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.600]  If you watch CNN tonight
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:09.600]  They're going to give you a story about how
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:11.600]  They're going to have Captain Hazelwood on
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:14.600]  Now, those who remember 25 years ago today
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:17.600]  That the Exxon Valdez struck a reef in Alaska
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:20.600]  It was all blamed on a drunken skipper
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:21.600]  Captain Hazelwood
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:22.600]  And he's going to get on tonight
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.600]  And he's going to apologize again
[01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:25.600]  Well, I directed
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:28.600]  I was directed the fraud investigation
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:31.600]  In that case
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:34.600]  For the owners of the shoreline, the Chugach natives
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.600]  I have a six-volume report that took me
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:39.600]  Three years of undercover investigation to do
[01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.600]  I presented it to the courts
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:42.600]  Now, here's the thing
[01:41:42.600 --> 01:41:45.600]  It wasn't the drunken skipper hitting a reef
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.600]  And even though Exxon's name was on the ship
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:49.600]  And I'm not going to let them off the hook
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:52.600]  The real culprit in the Exxon Valdez disaster
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:57.600]  That destroyed a thousand miles of Alaska coastline
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:42:00.600]  The real culprit was British Petroleum, BP
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:01.600]  They said, well, what did that have to do with
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:02.600]  Since the Exxon Valdez?
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:04.600]  The answer is
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.600]  And we just saw this in Galveston Bay yesterday
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:12.600]  When a tanker's hit reefs, they go aground
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:18.600]  Oil rigs leak, catch fire, pipes break
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:21.600]  That doesn't mean that you have to destroy the coastline of Alaska
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.600]  That doesn't mean you have to destroy the Gulf coastline
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:28.600]  Because you're supposed to have emergency vessels there
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.600]  It's not rocket science
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:32.600]  You put rubber around the things called boom
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:34.600]  A rubber skirt around the oil
[01:42:34.600 --> 01:42:37.600]  Around the stricken ship or a rig
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:39.600]  And you suck the stuff out
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:41.600]  With something called skimmers
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.600]  Look at those pictures in Galveston
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:45.600]  When that tanker just hit
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:48.600]  They put out 69,000 feet of rubber boom
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:49.600]  Around that thing
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:51.600]  They sent 29 ships into skimmed the oil
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.600]  When they build a new building
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:55.600]  On the edge of a river or a lake
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:58.600]  Like at Lake Austin here in Texas
[01:42:58.600 --> 01:43:01.600]  They put rubber booms out around the construction site
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:04.600]  On the ground and in the water to stop the runoff
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:06.600]  Right, so here's what's supposed to happen
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:07.600]  Now, let me tell you
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:09.600]  Here's the story that you'll love or hate
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:12.600]  But this is a story you didn't get about the Exxon Valdez
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:14.600]  Forget the drunken stipper fairy tale
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:16.600]  First of all, Hazelwood wasn't at the helm
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:18.600]  He wasn't like some drunk who ran into a rock
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:21.600]  He was asleep below decks, okay?
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:23.600]  The third mate, by the way
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.600]  Exxon is to blame for another reason
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:26.600]  Not because of the drunk
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:28.600]  Because the Raycast radar system
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:30.600]  Had been shut off
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:31.600]  And the radar was off
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.600]  It's like a GPS, like a Garmin GPS
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.600]  But in those days it wasn't $200 for one
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:37.600]  It was $2 million for one
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.600]  And Exxon didn't want to train
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.600]  People didn't want to maintain it
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:42.600]  So they shut it off
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:45.600]  The guy was just trying to drive a tanker
[01:43:45.600 --> 01:43:47.600]  Like Christopher Columbus looking out the window
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:48.600]  Okay?
[01:43:48.600 --> 01:43:52.600]  So Exxon turned off the Raycast radar
[01:43:52.600 --> 01:43:53.600]  So he didn't have navigation
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:55.600]  He's going through these narrow straights
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:58.600]  Literally dead reckoning a giant ship
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.600]  Exactly, that's what he's using
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.600]  Dead reckoning the third mate
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.600]  And so he slammed into the rocks
[01:44:03.600 --> 01:44:05.600]  Now, immediately
[01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:06.600]  Now, the thing is
[01:44:06.600 --> 01:44:08.600]  Is that if you looked on paper
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:11.600]  There was supposed to be right at Blyreef
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:13.600]  Exactly where the tanker hit
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:16.600]  A whole supply of that rubber boom
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:18.600]  To put around the ship in case of a disaster
[01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:21.600]  There was supposed to be a containment vessel
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:24.600]  With the skimmers right where the ship struck
[01:44:24.600 --> 01:44:27.600]  There was supposed to be a 24-hour
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:30.600]  Trained emergency crew right at Blyre Island
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:31.600]  Right where the ship struck
[01:44:31.600 --> 01:44:33.600]  In other words, it's almost as if someone
[01:44:33.600 --> 01:44:35.600]  Start a fire in front of a fire station
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.600]  It should be boom, it's out in a minute
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:39.600]  But what happened?
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:42.600]  BP had all that equipment
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:45.600]  The crews, the ships, the skimmers
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:47.600]  The containment boom
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.600]  It was all there on paper, under oath
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.600]  In writing, and it was a lie, it was a phantom
[01:44:51.600 --> 01:44:53.600]  It was nonsense
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:55.600]  It was a con, it was a fraud
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.600]  In other words, they said it was out there
[01:44:57.600 --> 01:44:58.600]  And they said, well, who's going to check out
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.600]  In the middle of Prince William Sound in Alaska
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:01.600]  The only people out there
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:03.600]  You just got a bunch of Alaskan natives
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:05.600]  Who's going to listen to them, who cares
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:07.600]  So that when the ship hit
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.600]  It was literally hitting at the exact place
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:11.600]  Where they were supposed to have a pilot station
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.600]  Which we would have worn them off
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.600]  They were supposed to have all the equipment
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:16.600]  But none of it was there, none of it
[01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:18.600]  And it was illegal, they signed in writing
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:20.600]  Because they'd been caught before
[01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:22.600]  Without having the emergency vessel
[01:45:22.600 --> 01:45:25.600]  It's like, look, every city has a fire department
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:27.600]  You have fire trucks, you have firemen
[01:45:27.600 --> 01:45:28.600]  And you have hoses
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:30.600]  And that's exactly what a containment ship is
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:33.600]  It's like firemen for an oil spill
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.600]  A fire truck for an oil spill
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:38.600]  They were supposed to be right exactly where the ship hit
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.600]  It wasn't there because they lied
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.600]  And they lied for a simple reason, to save money
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:45.600]  And they lied, and they lied, and they lied again
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:47.600]  And here's the real tragedy, Alex
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:51.600]  When that ship was heading towards the reef
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.600]  The natives of Tatelek Island
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.600]  Were standing on their beach, it was at midnight
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.600]  Watching this tanker come toward their village
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.600]  At Bly Reef, at Bly Island
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.600]  They're watching that tanker come in
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.600]  And saying, what the heck is going on here
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:07.600]  The natives could have prevented the disaster
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:11.600]  Because they were the ones who were hired by British Petroleum
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:14.600]  As, and they were trained by British Petroleum
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:17.600]  Given the expertise, they're given the special Mustang suit
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:20.600]  So they could drop out of helicopters into the water
[01:46:20.600 --> 01:46:22.600]  Lay the boom, they were all ready to go
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:25.600]  But British Petroleum had fired them
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:28.600]  Originally, they were hired for one reason
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:30.600]  The natives owned the Port of Valdez land
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:33.600]  And they said, if you give us the Port of Valdez land
[01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:36.600]  One dollar, one dollar, if you give us the land for one dollar
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:38.600]  We'll give you all these jobs
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:41.600]  And the natives fell for the con once again
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.600]  They gave up the Port of Valdez, they got the jobs
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:47.600]  And as soon as no one was looking, they waited a couple of years
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:50.600]  Then they fired them all, took away their equipment
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:52.600]  And so they were watching helpless as the tanker came in
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:54.600]  And this is how they take over cities, counties
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:56.600]  All these corporations are the same thing
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.600]  They have a good deal for you, then they cheat you
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:02.600]  But expanding on that fast forward to the BP disaster in the Gulf
[01:47:02.600 --> 01:47:07.600]  Their own engineers said, we can't dump water in the hole
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:09.600]  It's going to blow up, so they put more engineers in
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:11.600]  Who would follow the orders
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:15.600]  It just shows a totally delusional attitude by British Petroleum
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:18.600]  So how long until they do it again?
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:21.600]  Well, right away, let me tell you something, Alex
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:24.600]  In fact, right now, my site is a 95-second trailer
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:26.600]  Of my new film, Vultures and Vote Rustlers
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:29.600]  Which is my investigation of BP around the world
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:32.600]  And Deepwater Horizon, when you look at those films
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:36.600]  Of the Deepwater Horizon on fire, you won't see one inch of boom
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:40.600]  Going around that stricken oil rig
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:44.600]  There's no reason why all that oil had to hit the Gulf shores
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:47.600]  But it was just like Alaska, they lied about it
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:51.600]  Here in Galveston, a much, much, much smaller spill
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:55.600]  In Texas, today you have all this rubber boom around this stuff
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.600]  You have all these ships, none of that was there in the Gulf
[01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:02.600]  Once again, BP had lied in Alaska and they got away with it
[01:48:02.600 --> 01:48:04.600]  So they figured they'll lie again in the Gulf
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:10.600]  So when the Deepwater Horizon, when the pipe cracked
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:13.600]  And it was spewing into the Gulf, by the way, they lied about it
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:15.600]  And they lied about the amount, right now
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:20.600]  Despite the fact that Mr. Obama has allowed them to drill again in the Gulf
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:24.600]  David Rainey, the guy who was in charge of BP Gulf
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:28.600]  David Rainey is under a federal indictment for obstruction of Congress
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:31.600]  For lying, by the way, he'll get off
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:34.600]  Mark it down, write it down, Greg Powell said, the guy's walking
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.600]  The guy will walk, okay?
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:41.600]  You had a couple of enthusiastic prosecutors that actually grabbed the BP executive
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:45.600]  That ain't gonna fly, man, believe me, Jamie Dimon will get him off
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:48.600]  That's Jamie Dimon's company from JP Morgan
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:51.600]  That guy is good as home free
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:55.600]  Now, so what happened in Alaska, BP, when we brought the case
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:01.600]  We actually did draft the federal fraud case
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:05.600]  Fraud and racketeering against British patrol in the Exxon Valdez case
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:07.600]  But they said, if you bring that case, we'll never pay you a penny
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:10.600]  So it was agreed because we had desperate people up in Alaska
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:12.600]  Desperate, desperate
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:17.600]  So we agreed to take $125 million from BP's insurance fund
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:22.600]  BP did not pay a single penny for the damage accrued, not one penny
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:25.600]  So we took the $125 million because we had no choice
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.600]  Because people were desperate
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:30.600]  But they said, oh, hey, didn't cost us anything in Alaska to lie about the equipment
[01:49:30.600 --> 01:49:32.600]  So we can lie in the Gulf too
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:34.600]  There was no emergency equipment
[01:49:34.600 --> 01:49:38.600]  In fact, BP and the oil companies just put out a big full page ad
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:41.600]  In the New York Times and a lot of papers around the country saying
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:44.600]  Look at our spill response system we have
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:46.600]  We have all these ships and we've got all this equipment
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:51.600]  Hey guys, you promised that before the Deepwater Horizon explosion
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:54.600]  You promised it in writing, you promised it under oath
[01:49:54.600 --> 01:49:57.600]  And you lied, and you lied
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:00.600]  So what happened is because BP got away with it in Alaska
[01:50:00.600 --> 01:50:03.600]  Home free, they did the same in the Gulf
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:06.600]  I was about to say it's bigger than BP or even Goldman Sachs or JP Morgan
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:10.600]  It's this culture of even 30 years ago, I've looked at the numbers
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:13.600]  They would try to keep reactors from blowing up, nuclear reactors
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:16.600]  Now they just let them all leak, 90 plus percent
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:20.600]  Am I correct in saying we're going to break, Greg?
[01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:23.600]  That the elite are becoming more reckless and insane?
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.600]  Yeah, because there's no cost anymore
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.600]  They used to have to at least pay a penalty, pretend that there was a price
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.600]  There's not a price anymore, Alex, that's the problem
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:35.600]  So government and corporations have merged and they're above the law
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.600]  It's gotten worse than I've ever seen
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:42.600]  That's why I left government because there's no more prosecutions of the racketeers
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.600]  Forget it, the corporate fraudsters have...
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.600]  I want to ask you historically, then you're a smart cookie
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:52.600]  What comes next in history when major corporations and government are above the law
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:56.600]  What comes next? We're going to ask Greg Pallas at GregPalace.com
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:23.600]  That just saw the trailer for his new film, check it out
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:28.600]  Infidel Body Armour
[01:51:28.600 --> 01:51:57.600]  Just won't quit
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:04.600]  We travel so much and having a fake TV, it gives added peace of mind
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:08.600]  Burglars look for houses that appear to be easy targets
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:14.600]  But fake TV can fool even professional burglars into thinking someone is home watching television
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:20.600]  As a recent widow living alone, it gives me great peace of mind to set my fake TV near a window
[01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:24.600]  And know that passing motorists and pedestrians will think someone is home watching TV
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:26.600]  When I'm actually away from home
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:31.600]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet just like a light on a timer
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:35.600]  And they're so easy to use, you just plug them in and they're ready to go
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:39.600]  Plus, they're so affordable that we have one upstairs and downstairs
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:42.600]  Fake TV is only $29.95 with free shipping

[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:18.600]  Welcome to your life, there's no turning back
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:26.600]  This is it. A lot of beautiful great things in this world. A lot of good people worth defending
[01:54:26.600 --> 01:54:35.600]  But the world moved on
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:41.600]  There's so much complexity in the world that it allows corruption to hide behind it in legalese
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:44.600]  And there's always going to be problems, but there is a systemic attitude
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:46.600]  Not talk to people in media corporations, you name it
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:50.600]  Not just in government and high-level corporations, but in some of the public
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:56.600]  You just not care anymore and basically dump your motor oil down this kitchen sink
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:01.600]  Basically let your kids watch TV all day and eat GMO
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:06.600]  Basically drink a bottle of vodka every night if you want to and don't worry about your kidneys or liver
[01:55:06.600 --> 01:55:12.600]  There is a nihilistic attitude, but when you get it with military and you get it with a high-level government
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:16.600]  And you get big banks that are engaged in total insider trading, total fraud
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:19.600]  Who want to shut down all the other corporations they don't control
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:22.600]  It's a new dark age we face
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:27.600]  That's my view on where we're going if we don't turn this around
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:32.600]  You know the good news is government has low approval rating, corporations have low approval rating
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:36.600]  They wanted war in Syria, but the world said no, they wanted to expand that war
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:42.600]  I see a lot of positive things happening, but I see the establishment coming down with both feet
[01:55:42.600 --> 01:55:48.600]  Worldwide leaning towards more authoritarianism in an attempt to secure their ill-gotten gains
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:52.600]  We've got four minutes, Greg Palast, where do you see the world going?
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:59.600]  Well, I think that unfortunately this lock up between corporations and government, the official term for it, is fascism
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:03.600]  And one of the big problems is that there's just no penalties
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:11.600]  They used to at least pretend to grab a couple guys, like I remember the guy that put together the big electricity monopoly
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:15.600]  Insul was thrown in jail by the antitrust guys under Franklin Roosevelt
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:20.600]  Those days are gone, there's not even a pretense, they used to throw a couple corporate guys in the walls
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:25.600]  But that doesn't happen anymore, the greed factor is completely out of control
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:31.600]  For example, let's go back to this BP business, did you know, and you'll see this in my film, go to GregPalast.com
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:37.600]  Which is that before, 17 months before the Deepwater Horizon blew up
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:43.600]  Remember the cement burst out of the blue out, they used this quick dry cement process and the cement gave out
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:47.600]  The Deepwater Horizon, and they all were shocked, what do you mean you're shocked?
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:53.600]  17 months before the Deepwater Horizon, you had the same exact blowout in the Caspian Sea
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:57:00.600]  The same exact blowout in a rig, a BP trans-ocean rig, and the Caspian Sea had the same exact failure
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:05.600]  But they covered up, they covered up through bribes, through beatings, and they covered it up
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:12.600]  Now how did I know about that? I went to Azerbaijan, I actually got arrested there in the, what I call the Islamic State of BP
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:18.600]  Because they control everything, and I was thrown out, I got filmed out because I had one of those little pen cameras Alex
[01:57:18.600 --> 01:57:26.600]  And I got my material out, but ultimately I got the evidence of the prior blowout from the United States State Department
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:34.600]  Not willingly, it was in the WikiLeaks documents, our own government knew about the blowout in the Caspian Sea
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:40.600]  And they did not warn the workers in the Gulf not to use that process, that it had blown out
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:47.600]  They kept the secret, they kept BP's secret, and because, why? Because it was not only BP
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:54.600]  It was the junior partners in the Caspian were Chevron and Exxon, and they used the same process
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:59.600]  Which was deadly in the Caspian Sea, and 17 months later the same exact thing happens in the Gulf
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:04.600]  They go, oh we're surprised, how could this have happened? Well it just happened just before and you covered it up
[01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:11.600]  And the government covered it up, and the State Department covered it up, and then you get a guy like Manning
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:17.600]  Private Manning who runs out and says, here's what they're doing to you, and he is the person we're supposed to be scared of
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:22.600]  The anti-terrorism laws have put him away for the rest of his life, well he's not the terrorist
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:27.600]  He didn't kill those guys in the Gulf, he gave us the information that could have saved those guys in the Gulf
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:32.600]  He exposed criminal activity, Greg Pallas can't wait to see your film, thank you so much for visiting with us
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:35.600]  Thanks Alex, keep up the good work
[01:58:35.600 --> 01:58:39.600]  We'll try brother, you too, we'll be back with the next hour, wait till you hear this news coming up

[01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:38.600]  Dropped by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed

[01:59:53.600 --> 02:00:00.600]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:12.600]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers? Well, so does he
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:21.600]  He's Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:39.600]  Alright, I haven't gotten to this yet, but I will, in the next segment, the articles up on Infowars.com
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:45.600]  Well, these two dovetail together, New Jersey lawmaker rips gun magazine ban to shreds
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:55.600]  But then, you conversely, also on the East Coast, have a Rhode Island senator to Infowars reporter Dan Badandi
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:59.600]  Tell him that you can go after yourself concerning the Second Amendment
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:03.600]  That story is now getting picked up by Rhode Island newspapers and TV stations
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:06.600]  That story in that video is up on Infowars.com
[02:01:06.600 --> 02:01:15.600]  And you look at the state senator and his thug enforcer guy, I mean, they look like central casting out of a...
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:19.600]  If I was making a movie, I wanted to get thugs for a movie, I'd hire these two
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:26.600]  I mean, they're what casting directors look for, but really can't find the essence of
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:32.600]  And money on it, both these are guys on guns, of course, they just don't want you having them
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:36.600]  And I love how they bug their eyes out of people, these guys, like, they're all so tough
[02:01:36.600 --> 02:01:43.600]  People think if they get into government or have any type of uniform, they just, like, bug their eyes out of this crazy, narcissistic look
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:48.600]  That they're just, they're so much better than you, and they all just listen to joke
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:51.600]  Who would want to hang around with these two guys?
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:55.600]  And both of them tell the reporter, go after yourself
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:59.600]  Look at the look in those guys' eyes
[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:02.600]  They look like Michelle Obama, both of them
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:04.600]  They look like snapping turtles
[02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:10.600]  I'm beginning to think maybe David Icke's right, there's a race of snapping turtles in cloaking devices
[02:02:10.600 --> 02:02:14.600]  But the cloaking devices don't quite work, the kind of contour the snapping turtles face
[02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:17.600]  I mean, come on, look at the state senator
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:20.600]  I mean, does he not look like a snapping turtle?
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:25.600]  Or like a buzzard, you know, the Looney Tunes buzzards that go, which way do they go?
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:33.600]  Oh, hey, look, uh, hey, we need these armed slaves, and then we can do whatever we want, do whatever we want
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:39.600]  Look at this guy next to him, hey, he's got, you know, tattoos up to his sleeves
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:41.600]  Are you real scared of me, hey?
[02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:44.600]  I think I can bug my eyes out of you
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:48.600]  Does that make you scared? Does that make you quake?
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:52.600]  It doesn't, now we're in the government, we go in the capital
[02:02:52.600 --> 02:02:58.600]  We do whatever we want, and we're gonna take your guns
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:03.600]  And then once we take your guns, we're gonna take everything else you got
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:06.600]  Does that sound good though? You're good, hey
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:09.600]  Listen here, you wanna ask me a question?
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:12.600]  Huh, you wanna talk to me?
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:14.600]  How about you go after yourself?
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:19.600]  Hi, I'm Zuckerberg, you know our users trust us to save their information
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:25.600]  And not share it or abuse it, hey, the dumb effers, dumb mother effers
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:29.600]  I never seen somebody so stupid in all my life
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:36.600]  But this is, we got bodyguards, and we take all your guns
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:41.600]  And then when we wanna send in some killers with badges, we do it
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:43.600]  And there's nothing you're gonna do about it
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:47.600]  You salute the flag, it's ours, we captured it
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:52.600]  And you salute my office, and you appreciate it
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:56.600]  And you respect it, because I deserve your respect
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:04:01.600]  While I walk all over, you'll write like a doormat
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:07.600]  Because you people, excuse me, you people are captured by us
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:13.600]  Because you do whatever we say, and you're gonna go on doing whatever we say
[02:04:13.600 --> 02:04:18.600]  Is that clear? Good, because you're cowards
[02:04:18.600 --> 02:04:24.600]  And we bugged our eyes out at you, and you groveled on the ground to us, hey
[02:04:24.600 --> 02:04:27.600]  You like all that sounds now?
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:32.600]  We're gonna have the guns, we're the ones who do the hanging around here
[02:04:32.600 --> 02:04:39.600]  Not you cowboy, is that clear? Good, I'm glad that that's clear to you
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:44.600]  Because we don't want to have to, you know, get to see my shoes out
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:49.600]  And he's scared of me now, he's good
[02:04:49.600 --> 02:04:53.600]  And by the way, MSNBC's right, your kids belong to us now too
[02:04:53.600 --> 02:04:57.600]  You belong to us, you understand that slave?
[02:04:57.600 --> 02:05:10.600]  Now salute me, uh-huh

[02:07:05.600 --> 02:07:10.600]  Radiation levels have more than doubled in the last 60 years in the Northern Hemisphere
[02:07:10.600 --> 02:07:13.600]  From all of the nuclear testing and radiological accidents
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:16.600]  Radiolactive contamination is now in most of the food supply
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:18.600]  There's only two ways to avoid this
[02:07:18.600 --> 02:07:23.600]  Move south of the equator or properly protect your thyroid with nascent iodine

[02:07:58.600 --> 02:08:27.600]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones
[02:08:27.600 --> 02:08:44.600]  That's a smooth rolling music right there
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:47.600]  Tony Todd Allen is going to be joining us
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:50.600]  Bottom of the hour, I'm about to cover a ton of news
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:55.600]  But to let you know what good work this guy is doing
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:01.600]  We're trying all over the country to not let you put in your own solar systems, powered systems, even in rural areas
[02:09:01.600 --> 02:09:06.600]  They're showing up with code enforcers and going, we do under agenda 21, global standards
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:13.600]  We do not let you put that in, you have to wire it into the major power grid so you're not independent
[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:18.600]  He is involved pro bono in a lawsuit to fight that, he's a good lawyer
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:28.600]  A few years ago, he's the guy that got a judge to rule against the Bank of America and repossess the bank
[02:09:28.600 --> 02:09:34.600]  Because they wrongfully taken people's home that they never even had a deed to and it was paid off
[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:39.600]  And I had Bank of America do this to me, you say, well why do you have a mortgage with Bank of America?
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:48.600]  This is about 10 years ago, they sold my mortgage six times at that point
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:54.600]  And Bank of America bought it and I saw like every few months I was getting a new place to send my check
[02:09:54.600 --> 02:10:00.600]  Or a new place to sign up for wiring it in, automatic transfer for my mortgage
[02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:07.600]  And they said, oh and there's no escrow, I go live the documents, we paid escrow a year ago when I got this house
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:13.600]  And they said, sorry, you owe us $3,000 wherever it was and started letters they were going to foreclose
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:17.600]  I had to go get a lawyer, threaten to sue them, they go, oh we checked our records, you're correct
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:22.600]  Well the average old lady or the average working person, they don't know, they don't know how to deal with that
[02:10:22.600 --> 02:10:28.600]  Or they don't get a good lawyer, I mean this happened to me with Bank of America
[02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:36.600]  And it just shows a pure attitude by the big six banks, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Chase, Wells Fargo
[02:10:36.600 --> 02:10:45.600]  Bank of America, the big six, really five, you can count Goldman Sachs with the brokerage bank, investment bank
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:50.600]  They do whatever they want and they control the stock market and they fund the big oil companies
[02:10:50.600 --> 02:10:55.600]  And they fund the carbon taxes and they fund the anti-gun movements and they fund the open borders
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:01.600]  I mean they're the ones that run the parties and it's all a big joke to them
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:06.600]  Let's go ahead and go to this report, this is something the lawyer did years ago
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:09.600]  I just want to mention it because he's on a new case now, here it is
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:16.600]  This is about a family who fought back and won, their foreclosure nightmare started when they bought a house in the Golden Gate of States
[02:11:16.600 --> 02:11:21.600]  Owned by Bank of America, like you said, they paid cash so they never had a mortgage
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:26.600]  Well Bank of America felled it up somewhere along the lines and actually tried to foreclose on the family
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:33.600]  And what happened today, you're just going to have to see to believe
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:38.600]  Movers, a truck and an armed deputy, all while a nervous homeowner stands by and waits
[02:11:38.600 --> 02:11:44.600]  This is normally what you'd see when a person's being foreclosed on and their property seized by a bank
[02:11:44.600 --> 02:11:47.600]  But today, it's the other way around
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:50.600]  They've ignored our calls, ignored our letters
[02:11:50.600 --> 02:11:54.600]  Lively, this is the next step to get my client's compensation
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:59.600]  A Collier County judge said Bank of America had to pay Maureen Nair just and her husband's legal fees
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:04.600]  After the bank tried to foreclose on their Golden Gate of States property, but they paid cash
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:07.600]  The courts agreed they never had a mortgage to begin with
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:11.600]  After more than five months, the bank still hadn't paid up
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:17.600]  So the homeowner's attorney did just what the bank would do to get their money, seize their assets
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:24.600]  I instructed the deputy to go in and take desks, computers, copiers, filing cabinets, including cash and the drawers
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:31.600]  Outside the bank, several deputies stood by with Movers ready to start hauling out the bank's office supplies and furniture
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:36.600]  Inside, the homeowner's attorney was locked out of the bank manager's office by deputies
[02:12:36.600 --> 02:12:39.600]  While the bank manager tried to figure out what to do
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:49.600]  He was visibly shaking, you know, having two sheriff's deputies sitting across your desk and a lawyer standing up behind them, you know, demanding whatever assets are in the bank
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:55.600]  It can be intimidating, but so was having your home foreclosed on when it wasn't right
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:58.600]  After about an hour, the bank finally cut a check
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:05.600]  As a foreclosure defense attorney, this is sweet justice, because this is a symptom of a larger problem
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:13.600]  All right, again, that audio is a little bit blown out, that's from 2011, that's on WINK, CNN also picked it up, I've seen that report and played it here
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:21.600]  But the point is, that's government doing its job, that's sheriff's deputies doing their job protecting property and life
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:24.600]  And enforcing the real law
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:27.600]  And the bank just was going to take the house
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:34.600]  And most of the time, the courts go along with this, but now it's known they go in line court, it's known it's fraud
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:38.600]  It's known they never even had a connection to their mortgage
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:45.600]  And it just shows you the hoax level that we're dealing with here
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:51.600]  And why shouldn't they go after a million people's houses every year or more, just with Bank of America
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:57.600]  Who's got something like a 20% or more, last time I saw the number, they've got a huge percentage of the mortgages in the country
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:01.600]  Why shouldn't they, because a lot of people don't know how to defend themselves
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:05.600]  A lot of people just freak out and roll over when they get sued
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:10.600]  And again, I'm not saying the average Bank of America teller is a bad person or a regional manager
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:15.600]  It's the people heading it up that Greg Powell has talked about last hour
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:28.600]  The head of Bank of America making $600 million in one year off of ripoff mortgages
[02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:36.600]  Where they were selling some mortgages 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 times to investors
[02:14:36.600 --> 02:14:39.600]  So a million dollar house is worth 5 million, 10 million
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:43.600]  You sell it over and over again, no one gets in trouble
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:48.600]  And by the way, they've only increased the amount of fraudulent derivatives they're putting out
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:53.600]  And guess who in 2008 on October 3rd, they got Congress under the threat of martial law
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:58.600]  Looked that up, Congress threatened with martial law over banker bailout
[02:14:58.600 --> 02:15:02.600]  They signed into law there perpetually that that debt is ours
[02:15:02.600 --> 02:15:07.600]  So they're creating all this imaginary debt, I mean let's say I'm the globalist
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:10.600]  You guys give me a document cam shot please
[02:15:10.600 --> 02:15:14.600]  And I just want to make up all the money I want in the world
[02:15:14.600 --> 02:15:18.600]  In the past, if you're watching me on TV, I'll write this on a piece of paper
[02:15:18.600 --> 02:15:29.600]  In the past, they would take one dollar and they could loan out ten dollars
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:33.600]  That's fractional reserve banking, the global average was that
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:39.600]  And the banks, that would create capital on liquidity and that could be abused
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:54.600]  Now with derivatives, they can take one house and turn it into ten houses
[02:15:54.600 --> 02:16:03.600]  The equivalent of ten houses and take that money then and put that into more derivatives
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:11.600]  And keep it going until you've got leveraging to a thousand to one in some cases
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:17.600]  That's like having one drop of oil in a barrel of water and saying the whole barrel is oil
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:22.600]  No, you put it in your car, your car is going to seize up, it's going to ruin the engine
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:27.600]  So that's why they've been able to take over folks, that's why they buy the police, everything
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:30.600]  They run everything because they've got this fraud
[02:16:30.600 --> 02:16:36.600]  That's the point of, hey, look like an idea, let's just take houses that are totally paid for
[02:16:36.600 --> 02:16:41.600]  That never had a mortgage, hey, that sounds like a good plan
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:44.600]  There's world net daily reporting on the congressman, we had on, we actually had Brad Sherman on
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:50.600]  And broke that, bailout push included threat of martial law
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:54.600]  During deliberations over the 700 billion federal bailout banks and financial institutions
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:16:57.600]  Oh, that was the first payment, that was an open window
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:01.600]  They threatened martial law in closed session
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:07.600]  In fact, there's the video, fear mongering exposed by Mr. Sherman
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:12.600]  That's when he said it on the floor of the house, he also said it on this show
[02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:16.600]  And by the way, when I was first reporting on that and had him on, he was on my show first
[02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:21.600]  People didn't believe that it was actually a congressman and he said that
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:27.600]  And martial law doesn't exist, really that's what we're going under, I have the article right here
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:30.600]  It's up on drudgereport.com on the right hand side, last time I checked
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:35.600]  Where homeland security exercise targets, quote, free speech against socialist tyranny
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:41.600]  Under martial law, and the whole NLE national level exercise is not for the Russians attacking or al-Qaeda
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:45.600]  Or other groups, no
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:52.600]  It is patriot libertarians fighting martial law
[02:17:52.600 --> 02:17:57.600]  That's what the government's doing, because the government is run by foreign banks
[02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:00.600]  Period, period
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:06.600]  I can have congressman on, I can have former congressman on, I can have former top federal fraud investigators
[02:18:06.600 --> 02:18:10.600]  Top professors, Nobel prize winners like Joseph Sticklets
[02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:13.600]  For economics two times, I've had them all on
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:18.600]  And they all agree, global mega banks above the law, diplomatic community robbing everyone
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:22.600]  Setting up a police state so you can't ever get control of your government
[02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:25.600]  I'm going to say this again, I'm not going to beat you up with a headwind if you're in your list term
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:31.600]  But not my opinion, not my opinion, not my opinion
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:35.600]  And it's getting worse by the minute
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:39.600]  And we need good judges, we need good courts, we need good police
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:43.600]  But we need more importantly good people
[02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:47.600]  Because if the people will stop being so lazy and so disconnected and so uninvolved
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:53.600]  And will stop laying down to everything, a nation of sheep will be ruled by what, wolves
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:57.600]  If the people will start acting more independent and more aggressive and more liberty loving
[02:18:57.600 --> 02:19:01.600]  And more defensive about their freedoms and their space
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:06.600]  We will be known as what, liberty loving free aggressive independent people again
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:09.600]  That everyone was scared of
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:14.600]  There's a reason organized crime never expanded good until just the recent last decades
[02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:18.600]  In bible belt southern areas
[02:19:18.600 --> 02:19:21.600]  And it wasn't because the people were wimps ladies and gentlemen
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:26.600]  It was because they would kill anyone that tried to abuse or dominate them
[02:19:26.600 --> 02:19:29.600]  Hundreds of cases of people in the west and the south
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:32.600]  Overthrowing bad police departments, sheriff's departments
[02:19:32.600 --> 02:19:36.600]  All days if the police shot some kid in the street in the back, the people would go burn down the police station
[02:19:36.600 --> 02:19:39.600]  And then the state police would do nothing because they couldn't
[02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:41.600]  Because if they tried anything they'd get attacked
[02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:48.600]  I'm not saying that's what we need now, but the point is that everyone acts like a bunch of immigrants from third world countries
[02:19:48.600 --> 02:19:52.600]  Third world countries are slaves folks as people lay down to it
[02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:55.600]  And because there's a culture of corruption, we are now becoming that
[02:19:55.600 --> 02:19:57.600]  We are now a banana republic to every extent
[02:19:57.600 --> 02:20:00.600]  And I want to reverse that before it's too late

[02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:36.600]  Yeah, but would you have taken it though?
[02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:41.600]  You know, I'm not sure if I would have, but I'm awful glad I'm taking it now

[02:25:19.600 --> 02:25:20.600]  Have a special guest coming up
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:25.600]  That lawyer involved in that case, repossessing Bank of America
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:26.600]  As the people strike back
[02:25:26.600 --> 02:25:28.600]  But here's a stack of news breaking
[02:25:28.600 --> 02:25:32.600]  Venezuela arrests three generals for alleged coup plot
[02:25:32.600 --> 02:25:35.600]  So that place is descending into a nightmare
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:37.600]  And again, I don't like the west trying to overthrow the country
[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:38.600]  But the people are angry
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:40.600]  The communists have set up fake elections
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:42.600]  And they're even worse
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:47.600]  There's a few countries worse than the regular cancer of western government
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:50.600]  But I mean, North Korea and Venezuela are two of them
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:52.600]  Let's go ahead and go to the next one
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:58.600]  Pacific commander, U.S. laxability to conduct successful amphibious assaults
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:25:59.600]  That's in the Washington Times
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:01.600]  That's just the Navy trying to get more funding
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:03.600]  Continuing, open the floodgates
[02:26:03.600 --> 02:26:07.600]  Indiana becomes first state to scrap Common Core
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:12.600]  Fox News reports Indiana has become the first of 45 states
[02:26:12.600 --> 02:26:16.600]  To opt out of the national education standard known as Common Core
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:20.600]  And critics of the controversial K-12 program say the move could open the floodgates
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:21.600]  Brothers to follow
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:23.600]  Well, I mean, here's the debate
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:26.600]  Two plus two equals five is what it teaches officially
[02:26:26.600 --> 02:26:27.600]  Do we keep it?
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:28.600]  No
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:31.600]  Case closed, thank you
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:35.600]  Common Core says the kids belong to the state
[02:26:35.600 --> 02:26:36.600]  Do we keep it?
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:37.600]  No
[02:26:37.600 --> 02:26:39.600]  It teaches you that Heather has two mommies
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:40.600]  Do we keep it?
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:41.600]  No
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:46.600]  It teaches you just total mentally ill garbage
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:51.600]  Urgent NATO's Turkey providing air support for al-Qaeda in northern Syria
[02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:54.600]  And the article from land destroyers, excellent
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:58.600]  And breaks down how they're pumping al-Qaeda terrorists in out of the Turkish border on record
[02:26:58.600 --> 02:27:02.600]  And when the Syrians their fight back against al-Qaeda
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:06.600]  The Turks shell and send in jets to attack
[02:27:06.600 --> 02:27:09.600]  So pretty amazing stuff on that front
[02:27:09.600 --> 02:27:12.600]  Here's another article out of National Journal
[02:27:12.600 --> 02:27:13.600]  This is what I've been asking
[02:27:13.600 --> 02:27:17.600]  Who gets sued when your robot car crashes?
[02:27:17.600 --> 02:27:19.600]  Autonomous vehicles will save thousands of lives
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:21.600]  See, that's already begun
[02:27:21.600 --> 02:27:23.600]  They're safer than people
[02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:25.600]  Listen, we gotta start saying humans
[02:27:25.600 --> 02:27:29.600]  This is a world for humans by humans of humans
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:32.600]  And of humans for humans by humans
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:34.600]  We are keeping humans around
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:37.600]  We are not going to let the computers replace us with an anti-state
[02:27:37.600 --> 02:27:39.600]  That's what this is all about, folks
[02:27:39.600 --> 02:27:42.600]  And it's coming
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:43.600]  It's here
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:45.600]  Look at this MIT article
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:46.600]  Or article out of UPI
[02:27:46.600 --> 02:27:50.600]  MIT engineers create manufactured materials
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:54.600]  Half inanimate, half alive
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:56.600]  Engineers at MIT have created living materials
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:27:58.600]  That sounds like zombie materials
[02:27:58.600 --> 02:28:03.600]  Combining the advantages of living cells with the functionality of non-living materials
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:06.600]  I'm sure there's no way this will get out and cause a problem
[02:28:06.600 --> 02:28:09.600]  Even though top scientists say it'll probably end up ending life
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:11.600]  I'd say that's probably a top story today for the nightly news
[02:28:11.600 --> 02:28:13.600]  Something like that
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:15.600]  That is a big deal
[02:28:15.600 --> 02:28:19.600]  Ukraine's parliament has ousted the defense minister
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:21.600]  They've dismissed acting defense minister
[02:28:21.600 --> 02:28:23.600]  Over his handling of the crisis in Crimea
[02:28:23.600 --> 02:28:28.600]  Following Russia's annexation of the Black Sea Peninsula
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:30.600]  So that's just some of the news on the military front
[02:28:30.600 --> 02:28:31.600]  Here's another one
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:34.600]  Rumsfeld, a trained ape could manage war better than Obama
[02:28:34.600 --> 02:28:39.600]  Obama has been doing exactly what the neocons wanted and more
[02:28:39.600 --> 02:28:41.600]  Giving him left-wing cover
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:43.600]  And that's all that is right there
[02:28:43.600 --> 02:28:45.600]  Speaking of Russia, I don't know how to mention this
[02:28:45.600 --> 02:28:47.600]  But this is a big deal right here
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:49.600]  New York Times
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:54.600]  Russia is ousted from group of 8 by U.S. and allies
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:59.600]  It was the G8 that voted, as you know, along with the Security Council
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:01.600]  And the U.N. its counterpart to not
[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:06.600]  It was the Chinese-Russian veto that stopped the Syria war
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:08.600]  Along with public support against it here
[02:29:08.600 --> 02:29:10.600]  So now they'll just kick them out
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:12.600]  So a new Cold War is starting
[02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:15.600]  The United States, occupied by globalists, I should add
[02:29:15.600 --> 02:29:18.600]  And its closest allies on Monday cast Russia out of the group
[02:29:18.600 --> 02:29:19.600]  Of 8 industrialized democracies
[02:29:19.600 --> 02:29:24.600]  Their most exclusive club to punish President Vladimir V. Pudiput
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:28.600]  As Bush calls him for his lightning annexation of Crimea
[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:33.600]  Like Blitzkrieg, folks, the Russians were dealt a huge defeat
[02:29:33.600 --> 02:29:36.600]  When they were pretty much controlling Ukraine
[02:29:36.600 --> 02:29:38.600]  And it just got taken away from them
[02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:41.600]  It should be Russia killed 7% of the country in a devastating blow to Russia
[02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:43.600]  Instead it's like, oh my gosh, those war-longers
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:46.600]  Alex used to support nuking them
[02:29:46.600 --> 02:29:48.600]  And that's what the Ukrainian parliament's calling for
[02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:49.600]  Nuclear war
[02:29:49.600 --> 02:29:51.600]  We're on the march
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:54.600]  And if you're not for nuclear war, you're racist
[02:29:54.600 --> 02:29:59.600]  I agree with him

[02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:36.600]  Yeah, that's some creepy music
[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:45.600]  That's the music they play whenever the snapping turtle comes out at night
[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:49.600]  And goes around Washington DC looking for liberties to eat
[02:33:49.600 --> 02:33:53.600]  Imagine the snapping turtle, Michelle Obama
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:34:10.600]  Waring a red dress
[02:34:10.600 --> 02:34:13.600]  Alright, I'm screwing around
[02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:17.600]  I've noticed that seems to happen at 1.33 every day
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:21.600]  By this point in the show, I think I'm overloaded with all this news
[02:34:21.600 --> 02:34:24.600]  And I just want to screw around at that point
[02:34:24.600 --> 02:34:27.600]  I mean, Obama's saying nukes are the number one threat in all this
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:29.600]  If you cue that up, please
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:43.600]  And just all of what that means makes my head spin, doesn't it you?
[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:59.600]  Obama, Obama, Obama, he love you Obama
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:00.600]  That's enough
[02:35:00.600 --> 02:35:06.600]  Hey, will you guys cue up the birth of Obama videos?
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:10.600]  Did you guys see that from the TV show V that we did?
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:14.600]  And then the second one comes out and the tongue suits out and I go, Joe Biden
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:17.600]  That is a pretty funny video right there
[02:35:17.600 --> 02:35:20.600]  We ought to play the thing where I did Cobra Commander too, I'd forgotten I did that
[02:35:20.600 --> 02:35:22.600]  That's a pretty funny video
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:24.600]  Where I endorsed Cobra Commander for president
[02:35:24.600 --> 02:35:27.600]  Because everything Cobra Commander stands for is what our government now stands for
[02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:29.600]  So why not just endorse Cobra Commander?
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:34.600]  And people on the YouTube video keep asking, who is he interviewing? Who plays Cobra Commander?
[02:35:34.600 --> 02:35:35.600]  It's me
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:37.600]  I am Cobra Commander
[02:35:37.600 --> 02:35:39.600]  I am the leader
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:42.600]  Also the voice of Starscream
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:45.600]  I am the leader, Megatron
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:50.600]  So having a little bit of fun here on the broadcast, ladies and gentlemen
[02:35:50.600 --> 02:36:03.600]  They are chasing the lawyer around the office to get him on to talk about the fact that he's now representing a lady who is trying to be able to have her own off the grid system
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:10.600]  But the courts are trying to say, oh no, you have to be hooked in the power system, so while that's being lined up
[02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:15.600]  Look at this article out of thedailycaller.com upon infowars.com
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:21.600]  Media matters inexplicably attached Fox News for using the term homosexual
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:27.600]  Well, yeah, I mean, Michelle Obama and others say you don't use the word bossy because they're bossy
[02:36:27.600 --> 02:36:30.600]  They're bossing you around, they're in control of reality, the snapping turtle
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:36.600]  And you're going to do what they say or you're racist or you're anti-woman
[02:36:36.600 --> 02:36:45.600]  I mean, are we not sick of these people with the fake moral high ground constantly, continually lecturing us?
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:48.600]  I mean, these are not liberals
[02:36:48.600 --> 02:36:54.600]  I know I beat that dead horse to death, but I mean, this is ridiculous
[02:36:54.600 --> 02:37:01.600]  I mean, anyone goes around telling me what to do and telling me they control reality and I'm bad
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:04.600]  Those people are out of my life in about two seconds
[02:37:04.600 --> 02:37:08.600]  And the problem is with this government and these corporations, I cannot get them out of my life
[02:37:08.600 --> 02:37:11.600]  They are just constantly grabbing more power
[02:37:11.600 --> 02:37:18.600]  Media matters, the website of choice for Fox News haters everywhere
[02:37:18.600 --> 02:37:25.600]  Attack the Cable News Network on Monday using the term homosexual and a programming, advancing their particular argument
[02:37:25.600 --> 02:37:27.600]  That the scientific term was pejorative
[02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:33.600]  Yeah, you get arrested in England, BBC reporter Robin Page, we had him on the show, got arrested
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:35.600]  And he, by the way, isn't even really a conservative
[02:37:35.600 --> 02:37:41.600]  When he said rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:47.600]  Folks, heterosexual, homosexual, those are just names for a sexual persuasion
[02:37:47.600 --> 02:37:56.600]  You know, if you say that a woman is heterosexual, that means that she is for the opposite sex
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:38:03.600]  If you say that she is homosexual, that means that she's, I guess, homogeneous or to her own group
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:08.600]  I mean, that's why people think the word Caucasian is racist now or Negro
[02:38:08.600 --> 02:38:15.600]  I actually have been in a bar years ago, like 15 years ago, when someone ordered a Negro modelo
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:18.600]  And someone actually said, what did you just say?
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:23.600]  Negro just means black in Spanish folks, I promise you, that's nothing to do with black people
[02:38:23.600 --> 02:38:26.600]  The beer is like Guinness, it's dark
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:32.600]  That's why you call a light beer blonde, because in German that means light
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:40.600]  I promise you, I promise you the word bossy, it just means anyone being bossy, it doesn't mean putting down women
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:45.600]  And they all know that, but if they can set the precedent to shut things down like that, they can do anything
[02:38:45.600 --> 02:38:49.600]  Now we do have our guests on the line, and I'm very excited to get him on
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:55.600]  We played earlier, the local newscast was also seen a few years ago, where he successfully got a court
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:39:01.600]  To foreclose on Bank of America, because they took a million dollar house that they had never even had a note on
[02:39:01.600 --> 02:39:07.600]  That was paid for in cash, showing the fraud, and usually judges and lawyers aren't able to get justice
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:11.600]  But this happened in his case, where they had to pay for the lawyer fees and more
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:16.600]  And they refused to pay, so they went in and started taking it out of the cash register with the deputies
[02:39:16.600 --> 02:39:19.600]  And that's how the courts were supposed to work for the people, that is justice
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:23.600]  And if we had more justice, you couldn't have that in this country, but now
[02:39:23.600 --> 02:39:27.600]  Now our guest is back, talk about a Superman lawyer
[02:39:27.600 --> 02:39:31.600]  Attorney Todd Allen of gad-law.com
[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:34.600]  Here's the article from infowars.com
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:39.600]  Woman fights for sovereignty after judge declares living off gritty legal
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:44.600]  And more and more under zoning, even if you live in a rural area, they say you've got to be hooked in to the power grid
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:49.600]  Or they send out the little inspectors, they want to keep you dependent
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:54.600]  So he joins us now, right now, Todd Allen, thank you for coming on
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:40:00.600]  Tell me the latest on the banks first, I know you're fighting in Florida and other areas successfully
[02:40:00.600 --> 02:40:06.600]  Against that tyranny and the shift gears into the latest, the war on putting in your own off the grid power
[02:40:06.600 --> 02:40:09.600]  Yeah, thanks for having me
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:15.600]  So, yeah, we've been fighting the banks quite a bit here in Florida, the poor closure nightmare's been crazy here
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:20.600]  Running all over the courts and the rule of law, so I think we finally got that under wraps
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:25.600]  And now I'm excited to be representing Robin in this current case
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:30.600]  Break it down because I see this even in Texas in more quote, what you'd call liberal areas
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:34.600]  But it's also in conservative areas where they won't give you the zoning permit
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:40.600]  And if they see solar power or a windmill, even on your rural area, inspectors will show up in some cases
[02:40:40.600 --> 02:40:44.600]  Some counties aren't like that, tell us about this case, this is frightening
[02:40:44.600 --> 02:40:54.600]  Yeah, this one's particularly disturbing because the city of Cape Coral doesn't have any code restriction against solar power
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:59.600]  They're requiring her to be hooked up to the grid in addition to having solar panels
[02:40:59.600 --> 02:41:03.600]  So it's a redundant system that the city's requiring
[02:41:03.600 --> 02:41:09.600]  It's requiring her to be hooked up to the grid without even if she does have solar power
[02:41:09.600 --> 02:41:14.600]  There are a number of other issues, whether or not she can use rainwater or be hooked up to the city sewer
[02:41:14.600 --> 02:41:22.600]  So we're fighting the city really on a three individual arguments addressing sewer water and power
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:27.600]  We've prevailed on sewer and power just fighting the water issue
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:34.600]  Well I looked up this particular city and it turns out they even had debates years ago in their city council about Agenda 21
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:42.600]  Which is globally written corporate standardized policies that are designed to make people be in the grid on the system
[02:41:42.600 --> 02:41:47.600]  And so it's basically rent seekers trying to force people into their compact cities
[02:41:47.600 --> 02:41:51.600]  I know that you're just specifically dealing with the private property issue
[02:41:51.600 --> 02:41:54.600]  But I thought we all need to be sustainable
[02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:57.600]  What do you think is really behind this?
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:02.600]  This is, you know the deal saying hell have no theory like a woman scorned
[02:42:02.600 --> 02:42:05.600]  This is hell have no theory like a city scorned
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:13.600]  What happened is the city got embarrassed, their code enforcement department got caught on their flat on their feet
[02:42:13.600 --> 02:42:19.600]  And they're embarrassed and now they're pulling at all the stops to ruin this woman's ability to live black that she wants to live
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:26.600]  So we're really fighting the city on a number of different fronts just because she wants to live her particular way
[02:42:26.600 --> 02:42:37.600]  The city is trying to control how she lives and it's trying to enforce code restrictions that are currently completing each other
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:41.600]  What else are you seeing with the code enforcers gone wild?
[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:48.600]  We see cases now where they don't want people to have gardens in their backyards, don't want garden boxes in their windows
[02:42:48.600 --> 02:42:53.600]  And we're not talking about folks that are opted into some, you know, homeowners association
[02:42:53.600 --> 02:42:58.600]  We're talking about cities or annexing rural areas telling farms they can't have chickens
[02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:02.600]  I mean this is out of control. What do you think is behind it? A power grab?
[02:43:02.600 --> 02:43:11.600]  It's a power grab and it's trying to, you know, sit down and the city is trying to control how the people live their lives
[02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:18.600]  And really intrude on private property rights, thinking how you run your household, how it looks on the outside
[02:43:18.600 --> 02:43:24.600]  And how it's run on the inside to support government control until they are fighting, now they've fought again
[02:43:24.600 --> 02:43:29.600]  Oh, you just said founding fathers, guys, delete that FCC violation
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:35.600]  Sir, that's part of the seven deadly words. You can't say freedom, can't say father, can't say founding fathers
[02:43:35.600 --> 02:43:39.600]  That's like, oh, sorry, did you guys delay that? I'm sorry
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:43.600]  I keep forgetting those are now not authorized, sorry
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:47.600]  Have you heard Michelle Obama says you can't use the word bossy?
[02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:51.600]  I've heard that, which is funny because I've been called that as a lawyer
[02:43:51.600 --> 02:43:55.600]  Okay, Todd, well don't, promise you're not going to use that word, okay?
[02:43:55.600 --> 02:43:57.600]  Yeah, yeah, it's out of my vocabulary now
[02:43:57.600 --> 02:44:01.600]  I think you could even use the word bossy in North Korea
[02:44:03.600 --> 02:44:07.600]  Hey, what ever happened with that case with Bank of America where you foreclosed on them?
[02:44:07.600 --> 02:44:11.600]  They ran away pretty quick
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:15.600]  They ran to the table after we showed up at their branch with the making truck and the sheriff
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:21.600]  They came calling pretty quick and then they actually assigned a lawyer in Washington, D.C. to be
[02:44:21.600 --> 02:44:26.600]  It said you need anything if Bank of America does anything called this guy before you do anything
[02:44:26.600 --> 02:44:34.600]  So, fortunately I've been able to save a lot of call owners and a lot of unnecessary court time by using this avenue
[02:44:34.600 --> 02:44:39.600]  It's just sad that it gets to a point where a corporation can't manage its policy and procedures
[02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:44.600]  internally and has to resort to something this drastic to deter it
[02:44:44.600 --> 02:44:47.600]  Well, I was about to say I'm not absolving Bank of America for doing bad things
[02:44:47.600 --> 02:44:50.600]  but it's the same thing with like YouTube or Google
[02:44:50.600 --> 02:44:55.600]  I fought them so much they finally said here's this contact, high level, any problems call them
[02:44:55.600 --> 02:45:00.600]  and then you start to learn that these big institutions aren't even a lot of times inherently bad
[02:45:00.600 --> 02:45:05.600]  They have bad operators and subsections getting away with everything
[02:45:05.600 --> 02:45:09.600]  and then we are passive as a public and so it sets a precedent
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:12.600]  and that's why it's important to be aggressive, go ahead
[02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:18.600]  Well, they expect us to roll over, you know, if you call Bank of America a toll-free number and ask to get some help
[02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:23.600]  if you don't get the answer you want, they expect you to just roll over and drop the issue
[02:45:23.600 --> 02:45:29.600]  It's only when you make noise and when you, you know, demand attention, they demand them to do what's right
[02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:33.600]  that you'll get some response from the bank
[02:45:33.600 --> 02:45:37.600]  It just happened to be in my case that I had to speak really loud
[02:45:37.600 --> 02:45:40.600]  and have lots of cameras before they respond
[02:45:40.600 --> 02:45:46.600]  Tell us about your client, Robin, tell us about, you know, how this fight started in other arrogance
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:48.600]  and where it's all going in that city in Florida
[02:45:48.600 --> 02:45:55.600]  Yeah, Robin's a really nice lady, she's very community-oriented, very spiritual
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:46:00.600]  and she decided after a while that she was going to adopt this lifestyle
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:06.600]  because she thought it was healthy for her and it matched the direction she wanted to choose
[02:46:06.600 --> 02:46:10.600]  and so she lived this off-the-grid lifestyle for a while
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:15.600]  and her story was brought to the attention of a local media crew who did a story on it
[02:46:15.600 --> 02:46:23.600]  just on living off the grid, the benefits of, you know, doing it how somebody could do it, you know, stuff like that
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:27.600]  Unfortunately, there happened to be a code enforcement officer who was watching the show
[02:46:27.600 --> 02:46:32.600]  and decided to make it his own personal event that had to do with this woman's life
[02:46:32.600 --> 02:46:37.600]  and so it started off with an eviction notice saying that the home was in capital
[02:46:37.600 --> 02:46:41.600]  and that she needed to be vacated, that's where I got involved
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:45.600]  So they're trying to throw her completely out of her house and make her homeless
[02:46:45.600 --> 02:46:49.600]  I mean, this is a serious siege-level assault
[02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:55.600]  Yeah, the specific notice said, do not occupy this property under penalty of trespass
[02:46:55.600 --> 02:47:01.600]  criminal trespass violations or commit a crime by trespassing
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:04.600]  or vacate the unit, become homeless
[02:47:04.600 --> 02:47:09.600]  and so that's where I got involved and we sent that notice and they were sending it
[02:47:09.600 --> 02:47:15.600]  sent a five-page amended violation that colluded everything
[02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:19.600]  You know, in the code block, they could throw at her
[02:47:19.600 --> 02:47:23.600]  and then eventually we got most of those beat in court hearing
[02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:28.600]  but, you know, they've gone full-scale, attack on her, they've attacked her sewer
[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:34.600]  They've called the health department to accuse her of spreading human waste in her yard
[02:47:34.600 --> 02:47:37.600]  all of this without any factual support for the claim
[02:47:37.600 --> 02:47:42.600]  And by the way, that's why worldwide governments are using code enforcement as the new tyranny
[02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:47.600]  You know, you'd get a jury, you'd get a trial, you'd get a... I mean, to take your house
[02:47:47.600 --> 02:47:50.600]  you'd have to really do something bad, I mean, this is a big deal
[02:47:50.600 --> 02:47:53.600]  but oh, it's just a code, no judge, no jury
[02:47:53.600 --> 02:47:57.600]  Here's your letter, we found in Austin 15 years ago, old people
[02:47:57.600 --> 02:48:00.600]  it was more than 15, like 16, 17 years ago, including my grandparents
[02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:05.600]  would get letters saying, $2,000 a day fines, remove weeds and objectionable material
[02:48:05.600 --> 02:48:09.600]  and you already have $2,000 as of this notice
[02:48:09.600 --> 02:48:13.600]  and then I would go over and my grandfather mowed the yard and trimmed it
[02:48:13.600 --> 02:48:15.600]  the yard was spotless
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:19.600]  and so I called them and they laughed at me and said, we're not going to tell you what's objectionable
[02:48:19.600 --> 02:48:22.600]  and I said, well, I have a TV show and radio show
[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:25.600]  and then I found out when I covered it that it was happening to everybody else
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:29.600]  but they were targeting old people because they would just get scared and pay it
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:32.600]  and it just shows how predatory
[02:48:32.600 --> 02:48:36.600]  and then I had some police who were upset about what was happening
[02:48:36.600 --> 02:48:39.600]  point out where city council people live for me
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:42.600]  where they had holes in their roofs, big weeds
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:45.600]  I went and showed that and then how they were taking old ladies' houses
[02:48:45.600 --> 02:48:48.600]  so the city backed off, but I mean, this is just outrageous
[02:48:48.600 --> 02:48:51.600]  this tyranny of the code enforcers
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:54.600]  Well, this is how the city supplements the TINCA
[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:57.600]  by these code violations, these fines to be levy
[02:48:57.600 --> 02:49:00.600]  and by the way they designed the code
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:03.600]  the code requires you to consume their water
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:06.600]  regardless if you have a private water system
[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:09.600]  which the code provides for a private water system
[02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:12.600]  they still require you to consume their water, consume their electricity
[02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:15.600]  and if you're living off the grid and not consuming these things
[02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:18.600]  well, you're not a profit center for the city
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:20.600]  so how do you fix that?
[02:49:20.600 --> 02:49:23.600]  Well, you make a requirement to consume their product
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:26.600]  and pay them for the product and that's how we supplement their income
[02:49:26.600 --> 02:49:29.600]  Well, I just commend you for taking this case pro bono and so many others
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:32.600]  you're a real counselor, a true attorney
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:35.600]  a true advisor, I mean, you are, you're the type of people
[02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:38.600]  like my lawyer who beat the city on something similar
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:41.600]  famously with code enforcers
[02:49:41.600 --> 02:49:44.600]  one of my great lawyers, Eric Taub
[02:49:44.600 --> 02:49:47.600]  fights the same kind of cases here in Austin because
[02:49:47.600 --> 02:49:50.600]  they're very rapacious and I'm not saying all code enforcers are
[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:54.600]  but now they're wearing uniforms, I've had them yell at me when I'm videotaping them
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:49:57.600]  when they were next to my parents' house, it's incredible
[02:49:57.600 --> 02:50:00.600]  and again, this is government
[02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:03.600]  wanting you to be independent, trying to make you buy their
[02:50:03.600 --> 02:50:06.600]  overpriced services, we should want people to be on well water
[02:50:06.600 --> 02:50:09.600]  we should want people to have their own solar power
[02:50:09.600 --> 02:50:12.600]  we should want people to have a garden, this is the healthy society
[02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:15.600]  closing comments
[02:50:15.600 --> 02:50:18.600]  Well, it's really a battle of your individual rights
[02:50:18.600 --> 02:50:21.600]  your freedom to choose the lifestyle you want
[02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:24.600]  and that's from the front lines here fighting a city
[02:50:24.600 --> 02:50:27.600]  who's trying to force Robin to live a way that they
[02:50:27.600 --> 02:50:30.600]  see she should live regardless of their own opinion
[02:50:30.600 --> 02:50:33.600]  so it's really a constitutional battle
[02:50:33.600 --> 02:50:36.600]  on its purest form
[02:50:36.600 --> 02:50:39.600]  Alright, glad-law.com

[02:52:01.600 --> 02:52:04.600]  that can stop the NSA spying thugs in their tracks

[02:53:01.600 --> 02:53:05.600]  Sodium fluoride and other toxic members of the fluoride family
[02:53:05.600 --> 02:53:09.600]  are devastating the health and cognitive ability of the American people
[02:53:09.600 --> 02:53:13.600]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[02:53:13.600 --> 02:53:18.600]  Simple, dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on
[02:53:18.600 --> 02:53:21.600]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet
[02:53:21.600 --> 02:53:24.600]  but we can help to get it out of our bodies
[02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:29.600]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfoWarsLive fluoride shield formulation

[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:35.600]  Described as environmental crisis
[02:54:35.600 --> 02:54:40.600]  So they now have bottled air. Talk about fiction becoming reality
[02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:48.600]  We take you now live to China with translated English of the Chinese president denying bottled air
[02:54:48.600 --> 02:54:50.600]  Here is the clip
[02:54:50.600 --> 02:54:56.600]  As president of Planet Spaceball, I can assure both you and your viewers
[02:54:56.600 --> 02:54:59.600]  that there's absolutely no air shortage whatsoever
[02:54:59.600 --> 02:55:02.600]  Yes, of course. I've heard the same room with myself
[02:55:02.600 --> 02:55:06.600]  Yes, thanks for calling and not reversing the charges
[02:55:06.600 --> 02:55:08.600]  Bye
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:10.600]  Shithead
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:18.600]  He opens the bottled periair air
[02:55:18.600 --> 02:55:21.600]  Snorting it
[02:55:21.600 --> 02:55:24.600]  This is literally starting to happen in China
[02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:27.600]  He's just denied to the media
[02:55:27.600 --> 02:55:29.600]  Yes
[02:55:29.600 --> 02:55:32.600]  That's actually from Spaceballs, ladies and gentlemen
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:36.600]  But it's funny, but it's sad
[02:55:36.600 --> 02:55:40.600]  There you go, China sells bottled air to tourists as smog
[02:55:40.600 --> 02:55:43.600]  Described as environmental crisis
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:46.600]  You really cannot make this stuff up anymore
[02:55:46.600 --> 02:55:51.600]  And now media matters in the White House are telling us we can't use the word bossy or homosexual
[02:55:51.600 --> 02:55:56.600]  I mean, these people are outrageous control freak demons
[02:55:56.600 --> 02:55:59.600]  And we've got to stop letting them call themselves liberal
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:02.600]  They are progressive like cancer
[02:56:02.600 --> 02:56:05.600]  We've got to take over the Republican Party
[02:56:05.600 --> 02:56:08.600]  And we have to reverse these people's march
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:13.600]  Or they will destroy everything
[02:56:13.600 --> 02:56:18.600]  NATO is concerned over boosting of Russia's military presence near Ukrainian borders
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:22.600]  Well, Russia is concerned about the West boosting their military presence on the borders
[02:56:22.600 --> 02:56:26.600]  And again, I'm not defending Russia here, it's the West starting the fight
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:31.600]  Here's another one, DOD military training to scare the quote crap out of people in Florida as the headline
[02:56:31.600 --> 02:56:36.600]  Broward County residents complained about low-flying helicopters, explosions, shots, you name it
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:41.600]  It's all part of the ongoing conditioning of the military, the public, the police, everybody
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:45.600]  For the merger of military and police publicly
[02:56:45.600 --> 02:56:51.600]  Meanwhile, Poland back to Eastern Europe is quietly mobilizing its army reserves
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:55.600]  The Polish Prime Minister is warning that the world stands on the brink of conflict
[02:56:55.600 --> 02:57:00.600]  I mean, that's their words in the whole Crimean situation
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:04.600]  And the Ukrainian presidents calling for nuking and war
[02:57:04.600 --> 02:57:07.600]  I mean, this is not a good situation, hopefully it will settle down
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:12.600]  But here's another headline out of Reuters, hundreds rushed to rural Chinese bank
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:17.600]  After solvency rumors, more bank runs going on there
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:23.600]  Also report US nuclear fort knots compromised, multiple system failures and troubling in aptitude
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:28.600]  That's being reported on by Harvard University that the nuke plants are just melting down
[02:57:28.600 --> 02:57:32.600]  And the facilities just no one cares anymore about nuclear weapons protection
[02:57:32.600 --> 02:57:35.600]  Or maintenance or reactors, it's just who cares?
[02:57:35.600 --> 02:57:41.600]  Just wave a wand, it's okay to have Obama running the military and saying NATO's his boss, not Congress
[02:57:41.600 --> 02:57:46.600]  It's okay to let them devalue the dollar, it's okay to have GMO and all the food even though it kills the rats
[02:57:46.600 --> 02:57:50.600]  It's okay, it's killing the honey bees, it's okay if fluoride gives us brain cancer
[02:57:50.600 --> 02:57:53.600]  The mayor of Austin, where I live, just laughs at people on TV
[02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:59.600]  Here we brought a scientist from Harvard, or a scientist from Stanford about the brain cancer
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:01.600]  And here's all the documents and here it is in Reuters
[02:58:01.600 --> 02:58:09.600]  You know my answer? Mayor Levinewell literally flipped the audience off and laughed at them
[02:58:09.600 --> 02:58:14.600]  And it's not even news, I'm sure the statement's like well it's good the mayor flipped those crazy people off
[02:58:14.600 --> 02:58:18.600]  I mean we're crazy, we think Fukushima's an issue
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:24.600]  I know people, immigrants to this country, young people, we're 35 years old, you name it
[02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:33.600]  We've had like multiple, I know one person's had like five cancers because they were kid in Poland with the Ukrainian explosion of Chernobyl
[02:58:33.600 --> 02:58:40.600]  But now it's just all shut up racist, if you're against radiation you're racist and don't say the word bossy or snapping turtle
[02:58:40.600 --> 02:58:56.600]  The demonic demons will get mad at you and you don't want, you want her approval, you want her approval, big news tonight, 7 o'clock
