[00:00.000 --> 00:17.960]  We are on the march the Empire is on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[00:17.960 --> 00:37.520]  hey little sister what have you done hey little sister who's the only one
[00:37.520 --> 00:44.240]  ladies and gentlemen we are live and I'm in studio broadcasting worldwide on this
[00:44.240 --> 00:52.920]  live Sunday the 24th day of November 2013 we're going to be here Lord willing
[00:52.920 --> 00:58.240]  for the next two hours as we are every Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central I tell you it
[00:58.240 --> 01:01.360]  is weird to be back in the nice warm studio not the 30 degree freezing
[01:01.360 --> 01:06.320]  sleeting Dallas 50th JFK anniversary and I just want to thank the good Lord
[01:06.320 --> 01:10.360]  above all of you out there for your prayers that we made it back safe and
[01:10.360 --> 01:18.800]  sound without too many injuries it was wild and I will talk about what happened
[01:18.800 --> 01:25.640]  in Dallas and being attacked by the sheriff's deputies at the start of the
[01:25.640 --> 01:31.120]  second hour today but I'm from Dallas but I don't really follow Dallas anymore
[01:31.120 --> 01:40.800]  I love Austin and a senior police officer I knew a senior basically ordered the
[01:40.800 --> 01:45.440]  barricades open per court order after the ceremonies were over to allow the
[01:45.440 --> 01:49.840]  general public back in including us for our demonstration because folks had
[01:49.840 --> 01:53.200]  filed lawsuits and injunctions for their own group so it opened it up to all the
[01:53.200 --> 01:57.880]  groups and the feds responded with their deputized sheriff's deputies to attack
[01:57.880 --> 02:02.200]  us and then I but they had all their insignias off wearing solid black I
[02:02.200 --> 02:05.800]  didn't really know who they were some of them had insignias but they were in the
[02:05.800 --> 02:09.560]  back and I was like the Dallas police just ride it on us after letting us
[02:09.560 --> 02:13.920]  send us a setup and then I've been the Dallas police were like no it's the
[02:13.920 --> 02:16.480]  sheriff's department and the Dallas police were like totally freaked out
[02:16.480 --> 02:21.040]  they were right there when it happened and this was the Dallas police like
[02:21.040 --> 02:25.520]  what are you doing and they just started punching us and hitting us and attacking
[02:25.520 --> 02:30.040]  people with small children I mean there's high death video of it from three
[02:30.040 --> 02:37.960]  different angles up on info wars.com and you can see it all but but the video
[02:37.960 --> 02:41.200]  that went viral because it was on Ustream was like 10 minutes later when we're
[02:41.200 --> 02:44.280]  around the corner and they're still coming up and shoving us and stuff
[02:44.280 --> 02:48.160]  that's the video that's viral not the high death when we got uploaded that night
[02:48.160 --> 02:51.920]  that shows it from a rooftop we had a hotel room up there and heard noises and
[02:51.920 --> 02:57.520]  John Baum you know got a camera and shot the whole melee as it began but then we
[02:57.520 --> 03:03.920]  had high death cameras on the ground but obviously it is the video that is going
[03:03.920 --> 03:09.600]  viral out there is the is the Ustream of the end of the incident but that's all
[03:09.600 --> 03:15.320]  up on info wars.com and it's a case point example of media deception because the
[03:15.320 --> 03:18.600]  Dallas morning news says we were trying to break through the barricades and the
[03:18.600 --> 03:22.760]  valiant police the sheriff's deputy stopped us and that we were hurting
[03:22.760 --> 03:28.960]  pedestrians and blocking them just absolute total and complete BS and
[03:28.960 --> 03:34.240]  John B. Wells host of Coast to Coast AM and a famous voiceover person a great
[03:34.240 --> 03:39.240]  guy he was there to see what happened and and he is just blown away by their
[03:39.240 --> 03:43.840]  lies so the article sheriff's department lies about assault on peaceful protesters
[03:43.840 --> 03:48.440]  in fact I don't think that's still on the front page of info wars.com we
[03:48.440 --> 03:52.920]  need to get you guys to call Kurt he's the one that's on the Sunday writing a
[03:52.920 --> 03:57.960]  bunch of important articles for the site I forgot to tell him to leave that back
[03:57.960 --> 04:03.560]  now actually he did link to it in the today on the Alex Jones show area it's
[04:03.560 --> 04:09.840]  impose an iron fisted censorship and then that links to the that links to all
[04:09.840 --> 04:14.280]  the videos so he did indeed just intuitively do that so that is up on
[04:14.280 --> 04:19.560]  info wars.com in the listen listen area now quite frankly the reason I'm going
[04:19.560 --> 04:24.040]  to talk about this in the second hour is it's not very important compared to the
[04:24.040 --> 04:28.480]  other big news we've got on the Middle East with Iran this new peace deal with
[04:28.480 --> 04:35.400]  Israel and Saudi Arabia threatening to attack Iran and we've got big Obamacare
[04:35.400 --> 04:43.320]  news big open borders news big Common Core news two articles on Common Core you
[04:43.320 --> 04:47.760]  know two plus two equals five they want idiots so they so folks don't know
[04:47.760 --> 04:50.840]  what's happening to them six graders pulled on gay marriage abortion and
[04:50.840 --> 04:55.840]  gun control and Common Core Obama biography portrays whites all whites as
[04:55.840 --> 05:00.840]  racist that's what they're teaching kids right now Alex Jones here with a very
[05:00.840 --> 05:04.400]  important announcement for tree speakers we've carried a lot of amazing
[05:04.400 --> 05:08.720]  films and books over the years on the online video bookstore at info wars.com

[05:13.240 --> 05:18.240]  so chillingly convincing and that's dreams from my real father by Joel

[05:23.920 --> 05:28.080]  like nothing I've seen you want to know who Obama's real daddy is this is the

[05:55.960 --> 06:00.600]  all available at info warshop.com
[06:00.600 --> 06:10.920]  in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of
[06:10.920 --> 06:16.240]  unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial
[06:16.240 --> 06:20.880]  commentaries in Dallas Texas three shots were fired at president Kennedy's
[06:20.880 --> 06:25.960]  motorcade in downtown Dallas the first report to say that president Kennedy has
[06:25.960 --> 06:35.200]  been seriously wounded by the shooting it is a big idea a new order
[06:35.720 --> 06:44.280]  it was almost as if you were a planned impulse it just pancakes either you were
[06:44.280 --> 06:59.960]  with us or you were with the terrorists
[06:59.960 --> 07:04.840]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of
[07:04.840 --> 07:08.280]  soldiers not in the hands of criminals
[07:08.280 --> 07:14.960]  guns will be taken no one will be able to be all we can take all for many of the
[07:14.960 --> 07:18.200]  police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an
[07:18.200 --> 07:22.840]  American city global governance at last is it one world the central bank is in
[07:22.840 --> 07:26.920]  charge but aren't we all just living and dying from what the central banks do
[07:26.920 --> 07:41.400]  from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones and ladies and gentlemen thank

[08:16.720 --> 08:22.800]  has all the same information I've got a very important report for you today
[08:22.800 --> 08:31.120]  coming up at the start of the next hour that illustrates government corruption
[08:31.120 --> 08:35.200]  but also illustrates government doing the right thing in some cases and how
[08:35.200 --> 08:38.480]  the two different systems clash with each other
[08:38.480 --> 08:43.920]  just like it does in every other area of life whether it's family or business or
[08:43.920 --> 08:48.400]  church or dating there's the good the bad and the ugly out there
[08:48.400 --> 08:52.800]  and it also deals with just incredible propaganda and deception
[08:52.800 --> 08:57.600]  and I happen to be Reich's you know smack dab in the middle of it
[08:57.600 --> 09:02.400]  I'm in the news every day in major establishment papers and national
[09:02.400 --> 09:05.840]  television demonizing us attacking us because the old
[09:05.840 --> 09:10.240]  world war two saying of fighter bomber pilots and bomber pilots was that they
[09:10.240 --> 09:15.040]  would fly towards the flat clouds towards the guns firing on them
[09:15.040 --> 09:19.840]  for those that don't know what flak is it's large shells they fire up into the
[09:19.840 --> 09:22.960]  atmosphere at the level that the aircraft are coming in
[09:22.960 --> 09:28.720]  that explode and then begin falling down in clouds of metal debris
[09:28.720 --> 09:32.560]  that goes right through the metal of the aircraft right through the engines
[09:32.560 --> 09:36.160]  to devastating effect and in world war two the fighter
[09:36.160 --> 09:40.560]  bomber pilots like my dad's dad would would steer directly into the black
[09:40.560 --> 09:43.280]  clouds directly into the metal and into the
[09:43.280 --> 09:47.760]  Messerschmitts and the folk wolves to then drop their bombs
[09:47.760 --> 09:51.600]  and so when someone's under attack by the entire establishment
[09:51.600 --> 09:57.680]  like Ted Cruz or Ron Paul or Rand Paul or Alex Jones or Matt Drudge or any
[09:57.680 --> 10:02.240]  other libertarian constitutionalist that's because we're simply mainline
[10:02.240 --> 10:04.960]  Americans in fact if you study somebody like John
[10:04.960 --> 10:10.560]  F. Kennedy who died in 1963 50 years and two days ago in Dallas Texas
[10:10.560 --> 10:15.360]  he would be considered more conservative than Ronald Reagan
[10:15.360 --> 10:22.320]  cut taxes by 50% not 20% stuff like that that shows how far this country's
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.760]  gotten towards socialism with a fascist system on top of it
[10:27.760 --> 10:31.200]  i didn't know and i'm just now able to see all the high def video
[10:31.200 --> 10:34.960]  before i was attacked by sheriff deputies and women and
[10:34.960 --> 10:37.920]  children were also attacked by Dallas sheriff deputies
[10:37.920 --> 10:40.480]  i was able to say you know it looked like the police chief but i don't know
[10:40.480 --> 10:44.080]  the Dallas police chief is let me see the Dallas police chief and they looked
[10:44.080 --> 10:47.120]  it up that was up there for the 50th anniversary
[10:47.120 --> 10:51.440]  coverage and it was david o brown chief of police
[10:51.440 --> 10:55.520]  uh who came up to me on video it was on the live stream too folks watch this
[10:55.520 --> 10:58.480]  during my live radio slash tv show friday afternoon
[10:58.480 --> 11:02.240]  about 130 and said yes the ceremony's been over for 30 minutes
[11:02.240 --> 11:05.840]  we're gonna open the barricades up per the judge's order that demonstrators be
[11:05.840 --> 11:09.840]  allowed in after the the demonstration and after the
[11:09.840 --> 11:13.600]  official memorial the crowds had all left and he said we're opening it up and
[11:13.600 --> 11:18.160]  he was very friendly and very nice then there was a big argument
[11:18.160 --> 11:22.160]  30 minutes later with the feds ordering the Dallas police to remove us they
[11:22.160 --> 11:25.040]  didn't so at the courthouse we have video of
[11:25.040 --> 11:29.120]  all this they had 50 sheriff's deputies and other
[11:29.120 --> 11:33.680]  feds in in black uniforms with no insignia attack us
[11:33.680 --> 11:36.880]  they didn't even say go leave they just came over lined up
[11:36.880 --> 11:40.240]  and literally attacked everyone they said go now and then boom
[11:40.240 --> 11:43.680]  started pushing and by the time and the crowd did not
[11:43.680 --> 11:46.960]  even really resist they began shoving men women children in the face we're
[11:46.960 --> 11:50.720]  going to go over all of that coming up in the next
[11:50.720 --> 11:54.400]  hour and not so much because it's a story we're involved in
[11:54.400 --> 11:57.920]  again you can just search my name alex jones in the google click news there's
[11:57.920 --> 12:01.840]  probably 20 news stories a day and we don't cover them
[12:01.840 --> 12:05.200]  because it's not interesting when
[12:05.520 --> 12:09.920]  white house you'll fed propaganda arms make stuff up or
[12:09.920 --> 12:13.440]  exaggerate things we've said or whatever i mean that's just not news
[12:13.440 --> 12:16.720]  it is news when the dallas morning news and other tv stations
[12:16.720 --> 12:21.280]  literally and i have the news articles literally
[12:21.280 --> 12:24.960]  came out and said that we attacked the police
[12:24.960 --> 12:29.600]  and that we tried to rush in during the ceremony which is total bull
[12:29.600 --> 12:32.720]  it had been over for about 45 minutes at that point
[12:32.720 --> 12:37.040]  and again a few weeks ago a judge via a lawsuit
[12:37.040 --> 12:40.080]  said there's going to be an injunction unless the city of dallas
[12:40.080 --> 12:42.400]  and by the way the police department did not agree with the mayor they said the
[12:42.400 --> 12:44.720]  mayor you gotta let people hand out flyers in dallas
[12:44.720 --> 12:48.080]  the mayor didn't want you to be able to hand out flyers for two days before
[12:48.080 --> 12:52.320]  or two days after the ceremony and wanted the whole city to be a non-free speech
[12:52.320 --> 12:56.720]  zone constitution free zone and i talked to police on camera that said well
[12:56.720 --> 12:59.200]  we're not enforced on that it's unconstitutional
[12:59.200 --> 13:02.160]  so i mean i'm not here to send the dallas police or angels or anything but
[13:02.160 --> 13:05.200]  they upheld the constitution pretty good dallas police even smile is real
[13:05.200 --> 13:07.760]  friendly he goes nope you're right as soon as they give us the word you can go
[13:07.760 --> 13:10.640]  in we go in everything's great we're talking to the dallas cops waiting to
[13:10.640 --> 13:13.840]  go finally into dealie plaza we got through one of the checkpoints it was a
[13:13.840 --> 13:16.720]  few blocks back and then they were here come the
[13:16.720 --> 13:20.000]  feds ordering around the auxiliary sheriff's department
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  with their establishment liberal janet rena want to be
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.360]  uh sheriff she's one of those uh you know types
[13:27.360 --> 13:31.840]  uh and is you know very socialistic on record
[13:31.840 --> 13:35.760]  lupay something i forget her full name i looked her up i saw her out there and
[13:35.760 --> 13:40.160]  she's literally a fed and and and our sheriff's deputies are now federal
[13:40.160 --> 13:44.400]  minions who who literally look like something out of central
[13:44.400 --> 13:49.040]  casting if i was stanley kubrick and i was going to try to cast a movie of a
[13:49.040 --> 13:52.400]  futuristic police state where where convicts have been recruited to be
[13:52.400 --> 13:56.560]  sheriff's deputies i mean these guys look like something out of a movie
[13:56.560 --> 13:59.040]  and there was like a father a little girl on the shoulders that were trying to
[13:59.040 --> 14:03.120]  push him over with her they had some guy ramming his head into a wall
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.840]  they would push people up against now now see this footage is later right here
[14:07.840 --> 14:11.520]  this is what everybody keeps showing uh that we're showing right now is like
[14:11.520 --> 14:15.200]  10 minutes later so what i'm going to do is tomorrow
[14:15.200 --> 14:18.720]  on the nightly news by them we'll have all the high death video the rest of it
[14:18.720 --> 14:23.360]  of the police chief saying go in of us being peaceful of the whole deal
[14:23.360 --> 14:27.440]  because for some reason what everybody shows when everybody promotes when
[14:27.440 --> 14:30.800]  everybody you know keeps showing as well as after they push us around the block
[14:30.800 --> 14:33.920]  and we're still attacking us which is where i blow up at them and stuff and
[14:33.920 --> 14:38.960]  is certainly uh interesting um but uh again i'm going to come back
[14:38.960 --> 14:41.920]  get on all the real important news and next hour i'll spend a couple segments
[14:41.920 --> 14:45.360]  on this uh but i'm going to go through chronological order
[14:45.360 --> 14:50.160]  with the high death video and show the dallas police chief saying that's right
[14:50.160 --> 14:52.560]  you're that's right that's true and as soon as we can we're gonna open the
[14:52.560 --> 14:56.080]  barricades he goes sir barricades are open you're absolutely right please go
[14:56.080 --> 14:59.680]  in now now it's time for your uh demonstration
[14:59.680 --> 15:03.600]  and then the feds came over told the dallas police kick us out
[15:03.600 --> 15:07.280]  the dallas police said no right in front of us so 10 minutes later
[15:07.280 --> 15:11.840]  here comes deputized feds to attack us in the heart of dallas texas i mean
[15:11.840 --> 15:16.720]  that's an issue of of separation of powers between
[15:16.720 --> 15:20.480]  cities and counties that's an that's an issue of federal versus state
[15:20.480 --> 15:25.840]  tent amendment i mean it really really really really shows
[15:25.840 --> 15:32.400]  on on on so many fronts just how much this country has degenerated and how
[15:32.400 --> 15:36.320]  the media sits there manipulates it doesn't matter of the dallas police chief
[15:36.320 --> 15:39.200]  follows what the judge said doesn't matter of all the crowds are already gone
[15:39.200 --> 15:42.480]  in the media this was all about the government and the
[15:42.480 --> 15:45.680]  establishment media controlling the event only putting out the official

[20:44.880 --> 20:49.440]  out there on this live sunday broadcast let me just read you some of the
[20:49.440 --> 20:52.320]  headlines here that's probably the best way to just give you an idea of what we
[20:52.320 --> 20:56.880]  got to cover today nuclear agreement may result in israel
[20:56.880 --> 21:01.680]  and saudi arabia attacking iran that's info wars dot com
[21:01.680 --> 21:08.160]  linked to the zeruzel imposed and two statements by the times of london and
[21:08.160 --> 21:11.520]  of course that was earlier in the week that they said that if a peace deal was
[21:11.520 --> 21:15.600]  reached that they didn't like uh that's israel and saudi arabia if they didn't
[21:15.600 --> 21:20.480]  like it a peace deal reached with iran that they would then
[21:20.480 --> 21:24.400]  probably launch a military attack and that nuclear weapons have been transferred
[21:24.400 --> 21:31.600]  from pakistan to saudi arabia for possible use against iran
[21:31.600 --> 21:36.480]  and ladies and gentlemen that is not even on us news basically
[21:36.480 --> 21:40.560]  i mean it's in the news that they had the peace deal in france
[21:40.560 --> 21:46.000]  by the group of five plus one meeting in geneva that's what they call the group
[21:46.000 --> 21:51.680]  g20 g6 g7 g8 p5 plus one always diplomatic terms
[21:51.680 --> 21:56.160]  and uh they've made a deal to have inspectors dismantle
[21:56.160 --> 21:59.680]  any other program above five percent enrichment you can't do anything you got
[21:59.680 --> 22:06.320]  to have 90 percent enrichment this is a major major step towards peace and of
[22:06.320 --> 22:11.520]  course obama is going to double cross folks uh the the so-called right
[22:11.520 --> 22:17.280]  uh is is responding and saying oh my gosh obama's
[22:17.280 --> 22:20.880]  selling us out to iran now this is all meant to make it look like
[22:20.880 --> 22:24.160]  they've tried diplomacy before they attack iran
[22:24.160 --> 22:27.600]  okay and let me just give you the inside scoop and i told you this years ago
[22:27.600 --> 22:33.600]  okay from my military sources high level nuclear weapons the different
[22:33.600 --> 22:37.280]  components and the fissile material have been transferred by pakistan
[22:37.280 --> 22:44.240]  and russia over the last decade to iran i ran for at least six years has
[22:44.240 --> 22:49.200]  atomic warheads and delivery systems this is a
[22:49.200 --> 22:52.800]  literal political distraction right now
[22:52.800 --> 22:57.280]  the truth is iran is using hezbollah to go after israel through syria
[22:57.280 --> 23:00.080]  and and lebanon and other areas that's what this is all about
[23:00.080 --> 23:05.120]  using al qaeda against syria is all about taking out
[23:05.120 --> 23:09.040]  iran's ally and again i'm not a fan of what the moolas are up to
[23:09.040 --> 23:13.760]  i'm not a fan of basher Assad but i gotta be honest basher Assad compared to the
[23:13.760 --> 23:17.920]  moolas is very moderate and compared to al qaeda he's an angel
[23:17.920 --> 23:22.480]  so it's kind of like al qaeda moolas Assad and then you've got
[23:22.480 --> 23:25.520]  publicly israel and the united states and nato
[23:25.520 --> 23:29.280]  and the french at the head of it arming for almost three years it'll be three
[23:29.280 --> 23:32.960]  years in december al qaeda forces out of iraq
[23:32.960 --> 23:38.560]  jordan israel and turkey turkeys involved big time as well
[23:38.560 --> 23:43.040]  all with a plan to carve up syria and at least two to three pieces
[23:43.040 --> 23:46.960]  probably four or five give the Kurds a piece of it turkey a piece of it
[23:46.960 --> 23:54.000]  iraq a piece of it jordan a piece of it israel a piece more of the
[23:54.000 --> 23:58.800]  golan and a and a big water area with some aquifers
[23:58.800 --> 24:01.920]  and rivers they want i mean this is all about carving up the country
[24:01.920 --> 24:07.040]  and then giving al qaeda a small piece of it as well i mean i that is immoral
[24:07.040 --> 24:11.440]  and especially when we're losing all our rights because of the so-called al qaeda
[24:11.440 --> 24:15.840]  threat and then meanwhile our loving government
[24:15.840 --> 24:21.440]  is literally giving them heat-seeking missiles that can take down aircraft
[24:22.080 --> 24:25.600]  so that's the type of issue that we're dealing with here and i've actually
[24:25.600 --> 24:28.320]  studied the geopolitical ramifications of this
[24:28.320 --> 24:31.200]  i read what actually comes out in the policy reports in israel
[24:31.200 --> 24:34.880]  but comes out of nato with the cfr reports on what brazigni brazinski
[24:34.880 --> 24:39.520]  saying i mean i really study like i'm a diplomat or something
[24:39.520 --> 24:42.640]  and then i love the public who just watches football all day i'll be like
[24:42.640 --> 24:48.640]  kill them arabs when the when the iranians or persians and stuff like that
[24:48.640 --> 24:51.360]  just just having no understanding it's like george bush when he went
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.720]  yes we've got to defeat iran and al qaeda we've got to defeat shiai iran and
[25:00.720 --> 25:04.880]  and that would be like saying that barack obama was white or something or
[25:04.880 --> 25:08.480]  or that the redskins with the cowboys i mean it was or that
[25:08.480 --> 25:13.680]  or that uh you know christmas is is easter or something i mean it's so
[25:13.680 --> 25:17.600]  ridiculous in the muslim world but but even the rest of the world
[25:17.600 --> 25:24.560]  to say that iran is their arch enemy the sunnis al qaeda is sunni lohabiist
[25:25.840 --> 25:30.480]  80 percent of islam is sunni about one percent was lohabiist but they took the
[25:30.480 --> 25:33.440]  whole thing over very radical group that's al qaeda
[25:33.440 --> 25:38.000]  they're total arch enemies with shiai islam that believes you've got to have
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.880]  a lineage to muhammad to be part of the priest class and all the rest of it
[25:40.880 --> 25:44.880]  i'm not going to get into it it's just that i mean our media thinks you're so
[25:44.880 --> 25:48.960]  stupid and i guess bush was so dumb or was lying i don't know
[25:48.960 --> 25:53.280]  that he would get up and press conferences with the president of afghanistan the
[25:53.280 --> 25:58.560]  neighbor to india and say we got to get iran funding al qaeda and carzai who's a
[25:58.560 --> 26:01.840]  total minion of the establishment didn't want to buck him even like your
[26:01.840 --> 26:05.760]  excellency i apologize but those are two different groups
[26:05.760 --> 26:12.960]  just because it was so ridiculous and they're still doing it today ladies and
[26:12.960 --> 26:16.960]  gentlemen our government has been hijacked by foreign banks
[26:16.960 --> 26:19.840]  they're dismantling our republic in front of everyone
[26:19.840 --> 26:24.240]  they are literally funding al qaeda worldwide to take over egypt
[26:24.240 --> 26:27.920]  else their secular government the list goes on and on but i'll tell you who
[26:27.920 --> 26:30.880]  does know about this because they've been fighting them for so long
[26:30.880 --> 26:35.840]  fighting al qaeda real al qaeda is our military and our special forces
[26:35.840 --> 26:38.960]  they are beside themselves the last two and a half years
[26:38.960 --> 26:42.000]  and the last six months they've been actually physically training them not
[26:42.000 --> 26:46.240]  just delivering arms in jordan at giant bases i told you that six
[26:46.240 --> 26:49.280]  months or more before it came out the associated press
[26:49.280 --> 26:53.040]  for my special forces context they are literally
[26:53.040 --> 26:56.400]  training them in urban warfare and how to blow up police stations and
[26:56.400 --> 27:01.440]  and and and kill civilians and and do sabotage and a lot of them are committing
[27:01.440 --> 27:04.960]  suicide instead of not following the order why why not go public
[27:04.960 --> 27:08.080]  why not speak out instead these special forces people and
[27:08.080 --> 27:11.280]  are killing themselves instead of not following the order
[27:11.280 --> 27:14.800]  when they because here's the deal they go into these these training bases
[27:14.800 --> 27:19.040]  this has even come out in the news and it's jihadis that brag oh i killed you
[27:19.040 --> 27:22.240]  people in iraq and i'm going to go to america next there's all these videos
[27:22.240 --> 27:25.440]  of them chanting oh we love you've been lauding after we take down siri and
[27:25.440 --> 27:28.880]  Assad we're coming america we're coming israel
[27:28.880 --> 27:32.960]  and the military is in there training them and just flipping out
[27:32.960 --> 27:37.520]  do you imagine being in commando bases in turkey and in jordan and iraq
[27:37.520 --> 27:43.360]  training brigade level groups of al qaeda per month four thousand plus per month
[27:43.360 --> 27:47.440]  to then lead other squads of jihadis i mean the military is
[27:47.440 --> 27:51.360]  freaking out and you've seen them in the news speaking out but
[27:51.360 --> 27:54.640]  that's why there's a major awakening because the general public doesn't know
[27:54.640 --> 27:58.000]  suny versus shiai they don't know al qaeda versus hezbollah
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.480]  they don't know those groups hate each other more than they even hate us
[28:02.480 --> 28:05.680]  and so the the general public doesn't know the three branches of government
[28:05.680 --> 28:08.640]  the general public doesn't know who their congressperson is on average
[28:08.640 --> 28:12.000]  the average person i've seen statistics like 80 something percent of high
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.840]  school seniors don't even know who the first president was
[28:15.840 --> 28:19.600]  so so the establishment can just get away with all this but with the actual
[28:19.600 --> 28:24.000]  operators the actual military i mean this
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.840]  they are absolutely having a meltdown and they should be
[28:27.840 --> 28:31.760]  i'm having a meltdown i'm having a meltdown every day
[28:31.760 --> 28:34.560]  being called a conspiracy theorist because i know the facts
[28:34.560 --> 28:39.200]  hundred percent not my opinion i'm right period
[28:39.200 --> 28:43.760]  and our government especially under obama is just al qaeda in al qaeda i mean
[28:43.760 --> 28:46.800]  it is and they're building a giant army of them
[28:46.800 --> 28:50.080]  and even having them threaten the russians if they don't do what the west
[28:50.080 --> 28:53.360]  says publicly i'm gonna explain it all and come back
[28:53.360 --> 28:56.640]  give out the number take your phone calls but this could cause world war three

[33:55.920 --> 33:58.480]  publicly and supports them and is using them
[33:58.480 --> 34:01.680]  to attack their neighbors their Shiite neighbors uh in
[34:01.680 --> 34:05.600]  iran and in syria as well as trying to overthrow
[34:05.600 --> 34:09.840]  secular governments in places like egypt and other areas this is how the
[34:09.840 --> 34:13.840]  export revolution saudi arabia didn't exist till 1933
[34:13.840 --> 34:18.960]  didn't begin to exist till 1903 when a group of bedowins got hired by
[34:18.960 --> 34:23.280]  british intelligence to take over areas from the ottoman empire
[34:23.280 --> 34:25.680]  they created saudi arabia and now they're going to take over the
[34:25.680 --> 34:29.360]  entire middle east and make it al-qaeda lobbyist and then they're going to have
[34:29.360 --> 34:32.560]  al-qaeda attack us under orders from saudi intelligence and then the
[34:32.560 --> 34:35.200]  government will take our rights when al-qaeda attacks us
[34:35.200 --> 34:39.440]  and they had the head of their intelligence prince bandard
[34:39.440 --> 34:42.880]  came out publicly to the russian government a month ago and said
[34:42.880 --> 34:47.360]  you will let us take over syria or we'll blow up the olympics
[34:47.360 --> 34:54.080]  that's how dumb they think you are see how that works the saudi's attack us on
[34:54.080 --> 34:58.240]  9 11 the government opens the door for it
[34:58.320 --> 35:01.920]  and then they attack their enemy secular iraq
[35:01.920 --> 35:06.880]  where the hijackers didn't even come from i mean this is this is and in bush
[35:06.880 --> 35:12.080]  said that iran is al-qaeda when it's the opposite group
[35:12.080 --> 35:16.480]  and it's like telling a child that you know a puppy
[35:16.480 --> 35:20.320]  it's like telling a two-year-old that a puppy is a horse and maybe a two-year-old
[35:20.320 --> 35:24.160]  will go okay uh that's a horse and and in the rest of their life i guess
[35:24.160 --> 35:27.840]  well somebody tells them better they'll think that a chihuahua is a horse i
[35:27.840 --> 35:32.080]  mean when the american public is in the situation we're in because
[35:32.080 --> 35:35.600]  you're experts on baseball and football and acting cool
[35:35.600 --> 35:39.360]  but you have no idea how the world really works
[35:39.360 --> 35:42.240]  and i'm not talking to my usual listeners but just the general public out
[35:42.240 --> 35:46.160]  there we're in a lot of trouble here okay because the joint
[35:46.160 --> 35:50.800]  chiefs of staff are on record sending demsy a month and a half ago the
[35:50.800 --> 35:54.160]  alternative media stopped the escalation of war against
[35:54.160 --> 35:58.400]  syria and in a u.s. air force backing al-qaeda publicly
[35:58.400 --> 36:01.600]  that the russians were rolling in all sorts of high-tech weapons and we're
[36:01.600 --> 36:06.320]  saying we've sent our ships in and we're prepared for nuclear war
[36:06.320 --> 36:09.520]  because syria is their last port in the Mediterranean
[36:09.520 --> 36:12.880]  and they are they understand they're going to then use syria that borders
[36:12.880 --> 36:16.720]  russia and borders uh the caucuses to start
[36:16.720 --> 36:21.600]  injecting al-qaeda into the underbelly of russia
[36:21.600 --> 36:26.000]  al-qaeda is the black op army of british intelligence
[36:26.000 --> 36:29.840]  and then now they've been adopted since 1979
[36:29.840 --> 36:33.360]  by the united states and zebigny brzezinski on record
[36:33.360 --> 36:36.720]  they're used to take down the serbs and take one-third of serbia
[36:36.720 --> 36:40.400]  that was al-qaeda serbs fought back against al-qaeda
[36:40.400 --> 36:44.560]  the media called it slaughters took one-third of the country gave it to
[36:44.560 --> 36:49.120]  albanium that's al-qaeda they use al-qaeda against every
[36:49.120 --> 36:51.600]  country they use al-qaeda against pakistan
[36:51.600 --> 36:55.680]  they use al-qaeda against india they use al-qaeda against the russians
[36:55.680 --> 37:00.560]  they use al-qaeda against us this is how the big banks how do you bring down
[37:00.560 --> 37:04.080]  america and europe you fund terrorists that blow stuff up
[37:04.080 --> 37:08.880]  your 10 parts removed so you can't get caught even though it comes out later
[37:08.880 --> 37:12.320]  you have plausible denombility and then you re-engineer the whole society
[37:12.320 --> 37:16.240]  shell tanks and robots every police department make everybody a potential
[37:16.240 --> 37:18.800]  terrorist get rid of due process put in naked body
[37:18.800 --> 37:22.560]  scanners have total NSA spying and then go oh guess what it's not for al-qaeda
[37:22.560 --> 37:25.040]  anymore it's for the tea party gun owners
[37:25.040 --> 37:28.720]  returning veterans it's for you this whole apparatus
[37:28.720 --> 37:33.440]  i told you all before it ever happened because the rand corporation
[37:33.440 --> 37:37.200]  since the 80s but particularly in the 90s put out white papers
[37:37.200 --> 37:40.240]  like a national stabilization force just looked that up
[37:40.240 --> 37:43.840]  national stabilization force rand corporation how they're going to have
[37:43.840 --> 37:47.120]  checkpoints and how they're going to take away all our freedom
[37:47.120 --> 37:50.880]  and how they're going to slowly destroy america
[37:50.880 --> 37:55.120]  and i've got usa today right here where they're buying giant armored vehicles
[37:55.120 --> 37:58.080]  look at this headline right here i was telling folks about this years ago and
[37:58.080 --> 38:00.960]  then earlier this year and they would have the white house run
[38:00.960 --> 38:06.480]  media matters and msnbc come out and say this did not exist
[38:06.480 --> 38:09.600]  70
[38:09.600 --> 38:13.040]  well well just just the weapon systems cost $70,000
[38:13.040 --> 38:17.440]  heavy machine guns on the top you name it $500,000 a piece
[38:17.440 --> 38:21.840]  heavy armored vehicles the heaviest new ones
[38:21.840 --> 38:24.480]  delivered by homeland security to every major department and they're claiming
[38:24.480 --> 38:27.920]  that it was surplus no it's not i told you about so remember
[38:27.920 --> 38:33.280]  they denied all of this they denied this was going on the billions of bullets
[38:33.280 --> 38:36.960]  the train to take us on all their training manuals and then now they go
[38:36.960 --> 38:39.760]  oh actually we are spying on everything you do we are getting armored vehicles
[38:39.760 --> 38:45.120]  and bullets it is for you you are terrorist here it is ap spoils of war
[38:45.120 --> 38:49.200]  police getting leftover iraq trucks yeah leftover right
[38:49.200 --> 38:52.720]  coming soon to your local sheriff 18 ton armored
[38:52.720 --> 38:57.120]  protection military fighting vehicle even departments as small as
[38:57.120 --> 39:00.960]  you know a few dozen deputies even towns of just four or five thousand people
[39:00.960 --> 39:04.000]  are getting helicopters and armored vehicles and they're training folks
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.680]  for total war and guess what all the public training manuals say
[39:07.680 --> 39:12.720]  gun confiscation oh but there's nothing to worry about everything's fine
[39:12.720 --> 39:15.680]  ladies and gentlemen
[39:16.320 --> 39:20.160]  eisenhower warned us of the technological elite that was in control
[39:20.160 --> 39:24.400]  the military industrial complex and it's full 21 minute speech everybody
[39:24.400 --> 39:27.840]  just here's the thing about beware the military industrial complex
[39:27.840 --> 39:32.080]  and and that its threat will persist and continue to persist
[39:32.080 --> 39:35.280]  into the future that they were taking over the whole culture because they just
[39:35.280 --> 39:39.760]  gone to eisenhower and said we want to stage terror attacks all over america
[39:39.760 --> 39:44.480]  this was he classified in 2000 and then bring in martial law and he said
[39:44.480 --> 39:48.800]  you're all fired that was right before he left
[39:48.800 --> 39:53.360]  office and then the next group under those guys
[39:53.360 --> 39:57.840]  l.l. limnitzer and others went to kennedy and kennedy said you're fired and
[39:57.840 --> 40:02.960]  they said no you're fired and you know what they did
[40:02.960 --> 40:06.080]  eisenhower's like no we're not going to have a fascist coup in america
[40:06.080 --> 40:09.040]  just back in the 30s they had the mccormick dickstein committee
[40:09.040 --> 40:12.720]  where the nazis almost over through the us but the marine corps
[40:12.720 --> 40:17.120]  top general they tried to hire him to be the new president in the takeover
[40:17.120 --> 40:20.640]  and he blew the whistle but it would have been such a shake-up that it was
[40:20.640 --> 40:25.840]  it remained classified but for only a couple years and they had hearings on it
[40:25.840 --> 40:29.920]  the cormick dickstein committee you can actually watch the old film footage
[40:29.920 --> 40:33.680]  is is is some of its online and it's it's some of the first film footage out
[40:33.680 --> 40:38.320]  from newsreels of it with the two-time congressional
[40:38.320 --> 40:42.000]  medal of honor winner spendley butler going i was supposed to
[40:42.000 --> 40:47.760]  lead a team of 500 000 marines current and former with the army to overthrow
[40:47.760 --> 40:54.560]  us and create a fascist dictatorship we would then link up without off hitler
[40:54.560 --> 40:57.920]  you tell the average yuppie that drooling on the side of the road
[40:57.920 --> 41:01.120]  they have no idea they tried it in the late 30s mid and late 30s
[41:01.120 --> 41:05.520]  they have no idea they tried it in 1960 and then in 1963
[41:05.520 --> 41:10.080]  and now they've just done it and they think you're so stupid
[41:10.080 --> 41:12.880]  that i've been told they don't even care i'm on the air that's how pathetic they
[41:12.880 --> 41:16.560]  think you are i'm telling you absolute truth
[41:16.560 --> 41:19.440]  on the record and they're bringing the sin folks because they're going to take
[41:19.440 --> 41:22.720]  your pension funds all you baby boomers you're going to get nothing when they're
[41:22.720 --> 41:25.280]  done they're going to federalize it to protect
[41:25.280 --> 41:29.040]  it take 20 30 the first round a few years later 20 30 more percent
[41:29.040 --> 41:33.040]  by the time you're done you'll get 10 of what you were going to get
[41:33.040 --> 41:36.240]  on purpose it's already been done in europe
[41:36.240 --> 41:39.760]  and but you just remember you were told this they're putting this in
[41:39.760 --> 41:43.600]  to impoverish you as a tool of political control so i'm going to get your take on
[41:43.600 --> 41:47.040]  this uh israel and saudi arabia teamed up
[41:47.040 --> 41:51.280]  and i guess i'm supposed to support israel so i salute al-qaeda and i support
[41:51.280 --> 41:54.560]  israel i salute israel and i think it's good that israel
[41:54.560 --> 41:58.400]  in the u.s and nato are funding al-qaeda and linked up with saudi arabia and are
[41:58.400 --> 42:01.360]  openly preparing to nuke iran and i think it'll be great when russia
[42:01.360 --> 42:04.080]  responds and there's a nuclear war with china as well
[42:04.080 --> 42:06.960]  and india and pakistan have said they're going to nuke each other and i think
[42:06.960 --> 42:09.920]  this is really a great idea in fact let me just give a round of applause the
[42:09.920 --> 42:14.080]  establishment this is a great idea wonderful plan new world order
[42:14.080 --> 42:16.960]  wonderful plan here's the only problem the chairman of the joint chief of
[42:16.960 --> 42:20.560]  staff actually must love his grandchildren because he went to obama
[42:20.560 --> 42:23.920]  on the eve of the strikes that we're going to start world war three
[42:23.920 --> 42:26.640]  and the pentagram is on record saying there's good chances to start a nuclear
[42:26.640 --> 42:29.360]  war and we don't want to back al-qaeda and we have
[42:29.360 --> 42:33.280]  a mutiny of officers well obama's just purged dozens of top generals and
[42:33.280 --> 42:38.320]  admiral since then who wouldn't back al-qaeda so there's a major underground
[42:38.320 --> 42:43.200]  war going on like doctor strange love for for real right now
[42:43.200 --> 42:48.080]  okay and and that's what matters not mainstream news saying peanut butter and
[42:48.080 --> 42:51.280]  jelly sandwich is a racist and i'm not joking we're gonna cover that when we

[44:00.160 --> 44:04.480]  a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why
[44:04.480 --> 44:08.160]  even if i had a pretty good size meal that i was still starving and my research
[44:08.160 --> 44:12.560]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on
[44:12.560 --> 44:15.360]  here in the united states and across the industrialized world
[44:15.360 --> 44:19.040]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key

[48:29.680 --> 48:33.600]  news i haven't even begun to get into yet on obama care on trying to open the
[48:33.600 --> 48:38.080]  borders up to further devalue the currency and bankrupt the nation
[48:38.080 --> 48:42.720]  as part of that plan of engineered dependency
[48:42.720 --> 48:46.480]  who can deny we've been engineered towards dependency
[48:46.480 --> 48:50.080]  via the plan of learned helplessness and domestication
[48:50.080 --> 48:56.000]  best personified by cloward and piven and other sociological programs of
[48:56.000 --> 49:02.560]  domestication but before i go any further
[49:02.560 --> 49:05.440]  i'm going to get to this in the next hour and then into the attack on free
[49:05.440 --> 49:08.160]  speech in dallas and how it's happening systematically
[49:08.160 --> 49:12.240]  across the world but look at these headlines right here
[49:12.240 --> 49:16.240]  six graders polled on gay marriage abortion and gun control
[49:16.240 --> 49:20.160]  that's why let the school then start putting their ideas into them
[49:20.160 --> 49:23.840]  under common core and then we have copies of the common core
[49:23.840 --> 49:28.000]  federal curriculum that's that that's the control freaks that run
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.040]  the federal government that openly say your kids belong to them
[49:31.040 --> 49:34.960]  asking questions like that and then asking are you a republican or you a
[49:34.960 --> 49:37.760]  democrat and doctor dating them into the two-party
[49:37.760 --> 49:40.720]  system as well this is all in info wars dot com
[49:40.720 --> 49:44.160]  here's another one common core fourth grade reading
[49:44.160 --> 49:49.920]  obama biography portrays whites as racist all whites are racist
[49:49.920 --> 49:52.800]  that's common core it also teaches two plus two
[49:52.800 --> 49:56.960]  equals four and i'm actually showing for tv viewers that are watching
[49:56.960 --> 50:00.480]  at prisonplanet.tv and info wars dot com four slash show right now
[50:00.480 --> 50:05.360]  they can see copies of this now again they think you're so dumb
[50:05.360 --> 50:10.480]  they can teach your kids two plus two equals five to literally screw them up
[50:10.480 --> 50:13.680]  so that they're dumbed down jellyfish it's like the last decade there been a
[50:13.680 --> 50:16.080]  bunch of lawsuits are on the country and look this up
[50:16.080 --> 50:19.600]  where they don't want to hire cops with over a hundred iq and it came out in
[50:19.600 --> 50:24.640]  court because they end up not following orders and asking questions
[50:24.640 --> 50:28.160]  they want authoritarian people that'll follow orders
[50:28.160 --> 50:30.720]  and i gotta tell you cops are different than they used to be
[50:30.720 --> 50:34.320]  especially the young ones you run into older cops or whatever they're sharp
[50:34.320 --> 50:36.640]  they're smart these won't they used to want smart
[50:36.640 --> 50:40.800]  you know tough guys now they want dumb thugs that doesn't mean all departments
[50:40.800 --> 50:45.920]  follow this but the big ones do they want idiots
[50:45.920 --> 50:50.000]  and it is very frightening you see what's happened to this country
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.760]  very frightening now i bring into this next piece right here
[50:53.760 --> 50:57.520]  now i was out of town wednesday night when this broke and i went to the
[50:57.520 --> 51:01.760]  portland tribune when i when i heard it on the radio i
[51:01.760 --> 51:05.520]  even i didn't believe this but but i went there it's true you heard how
[51:05.520 --> 51:09.440]  all over the country now they're saying that paper bags are not allowed brown
[51:09.440 --> 51:12.400]  ones because that might hurt brown people's feelings i'm not
[51:12.400 --> 51:16.480]  kidding it's like if i had a black car it's gonna make panthers feel
[51:16.480 --> 51:20.240]  bad or something uh now again this is done on purpose
[51:20.240 --> 51:23.680]  these are not idiots these these political correct folks want to make
[51:23.680 --> 51:28.160]  everything bad except all the real discrimination against all of us by foreign
[51:28.160 --> 51:31.120]  offshore banks robbing our future devaluing our dollar
[51:31.120 --> 51:35.120]  getting tens of trillions in the last few years of our taxpayer money
[51:35.120 --> 51:39.680]  to bail out their fraudulent derivatives instead of them going to jail
[51:39.680 --> 51:46.480]  so they want us divided on sex on race on uh on a religion and then in the name
[51:46.480 --> 51:49.920]  of fighting the division they then bring more of them
[51:49.920 --> 51:53.680]  they are racialist
[51:53.680 --> 51:57.360]  i was on coast to coast a m last night with john b wells and he made that
[51:57.360 --> 52:00.080]  point and i knew this but never stayed on air so i'm glad he reminded me
[52:00.080 --> 52:03.040]  there are racists that are the toothless idiots
[52:03.040 --> 52:09.280]  but then there are the racialists and the poverty pimps on record and this is
[52:09.280 --> 52:11.680]  all in the ford foundation documents this is public
[52:11.680 --> 52:15.440]  that literally create liberation theology and make everyone think they're
[52:15.440 --> 52:19.200]  going to have success by being in a group because then they could just run
[52:19.200 --> 52:22.000]  the leaders of those groups the last thing they want is you thinking as an
[52:22.000 --> 52:25.520]  individual like i'm a liberty lover and an artist
[52:25.520 --> 52:30.880]  and a father not a white guy but see if they can just get the minority groups
[52:30.880 --> 52:34.240]  to attack me as a white guy i'll then only think as a white guy and then
[52:34.240 --> 52:37.360]  whatever establishment white leader there is that's what i'll go with
[52:37.360 --> 52:40.560]  instead of hey you're hispanic i'm white or whatever black
[52:40.560 --> 52:44.160]  we want bill of rights we want second amendment we want family values we want
[52:44.160 --> 52:48.000]  national sovereignty we're friends we're together we're just the same
[52:48.000 --> 52:52.240]  oh no no no no no no no well why if you're a libertarian you're secretly a
[52:52.240 --> 52:55.440]  racist why if you're in the nra you're a clan member
[52:55.440 --> 52:59.760]  that's what they say as a talking point when the nra was founded to arm
[52:59.760 --> 53:03.680]  newly freed black slaves who were being attacked by the clan fact
[53:03.680 --> 53:08.160]  but see they know that so they flip it on its head
[53:08.160 --> 53:12.560]  these are known liars folks these are race pimps
[53:12.560 --> 53:15.680]  and sure the main line republican party they'll do
[53:15.680 --> 53:19.680]  race ads and stuff too and in in in politics but i mean the democratic party
[53:19.680 --> 53:22.960]  are the masters of it and i'm not even a republican the
[53:22.960 --> 53:28.080]  point is the democratic party is the vanguard the cutting edge of the
[53:28.080 --> 53:32.960]  collectivization balkanization of america and here it is out of the portland
[53:32.960 --> 53:38.640]  tribune the teachers literally bully uh the elementary
[53:38.640 --> 53:42.560]  middle school students that's k through a
[53:42.560 --> 53:46.640]  and they teach them that peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are racist
[53:46.640 --> 53:50.800]  because it may hurt somali or hispanic students
[53:50.800 --> 53:54.320]  because another culture's food is hurtful to them
[53:54.320 --> 53:58.480]  you can go read it folks you're like wow that's crazy but your kid doesn't know
[53:58.480 --> 54:01.760]  it's crazy and literally comes home and then starts
[54:01.760 --> 54:06.080]  bossing you around and so what it's saying is all cultures are good but
[54:06.080 --> 54:11.040]  western culture the sandwich invented by the earl of sandwich
[54:11.040 --> 54:13.920]  i don't know 600 years ago he liked to play poker
[54:13.920 --> 54:17.040]  uh and and would and would tell him so he didn't have to sit down and eat all
[54:17.040 --> 54:20.800]  daynily hell europeans only started using knives and forks about 600-700
[54:20.800 --> 54:24.480]  years ago too so yes the sandwich is bad i really apologize
[54:24.480 --> 54:27.600]  again just hyper aware oh that's sandwich i've told you i've been at
[54:27.600 --> 54:30.960]  martin spring's big swimming hole where sometimes there's a thousand people
[54:30.960 --> 54:34.640]  that have been like 500 people there that day and there was a hispanic guy
[54:34.640 --> 54:38.560]  and and and two white guys and the hispanic guy goes
[54:38.560 --> 54:42.160]  they were obviously stoned out of their gourd and they were totally
[54:42.160 --> 54:45.360]  totally been smoking weed you could tell and they're like hey man let's go to
[54:45.360 --> 54:49.200]  that great chinese food place one guy goes one of the white guys goes
[54:49.200 --> 54:52.400]  to the hispanic goes don't say chinese that's racist they were all looking
[54:52.400 --> 54:58.240]  around i mean they listen they think language now is racist folks
[54:58.240 --> 55:01.600]  that the public's so dumbed down we're just afraid okay i want a paper bag i
[55:01.600 --> 55:04.800]  won't have a remember it started in san francisco now it's all over the country
[55:04.800 --> 55:07.440]  where they tell you you can't wear american flag shirts because it hurts
[55:07.440 --> 55:11.440]  the hispanic's feelings most hispanics want to be
[55:11.440 --> 55:14.320]  americans anyways but it's it's the radical nationalism of
[55:14.320 --> 55:18.080]  mexico saying mexico mexico so don't wear an american flag
[55:18.080 --> 55:21.280]  you could pull that up students sit home for wearing american flags guys
[55:21.280 --> 55:25.760]  search it listeners won't believe it this is the magnitude of what i'm talking
[55:25.760 --> 55:28.160]  about we're gonna come back from break and go to your

[55:45.040 --> 55:48.400]  students too so that's what it comes down to total
[55:48.400 --> 55:52.240]  division ladies and gentlemen where we're all divided in the establishment is
[55:52.240 --> 55:55.760]  unified and screwing us now i got something exciting i'm

[56:22.400 --> 56:26.240]  correct i apologize of the other ones black it's even worse well the white
[56:26.240 --> 56:29.520]  letterings against white people too and the blues against people with blue eyes

[56:41.040 --> 56:44.800]  issue the black bag is racist but the point is i come out with wake up america

[57:05.440 --> 57:08.240]  then i won't have any more until the next coffee season
[57:08.240 --> 57:12.720]  this is my favorite coffee two different blends it's arabica
[57:12.720 --> 57:15.600]  way better than guatemalan because it's in the same type of mountains
[57:15.600 --> 57:19.040]  but even better from mexico as organic as it gets
[57:19.040 --> 57:22.640]  and it supports the mexican farmers down there as well and then it's roasted in
[57:22.640 --> 57:26.720]  colorata so it's really racist for supporting hispanic farmers down there
[57:26.720 --> 57:31.040]  but it's wake up america immune support 100 organic blend with mushrooms and

[58:00.320 --> 58:03.120]  the world guess what else is in the halogen family
[58:03.120 --> 58:08.000]  fluoride ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.400]  did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[58:12.400 --> 58:16.400]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results

[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:45.760]  even though the dallas police chief opened up the

[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:32.320]  hello brother hey brother i wanted to talk about
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:37.520]  they're trying to they're trying to start world war three again aren't they
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.640]  yes and the russians are not blinking and and again i i'm not a russian i i'm
[01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:46.240]  pro america but if foreign banks run my country and are trying to start world
[01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:49.200]  war three and the russians aren't starting it
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:52.640]  we're in the wrong and we've got to go after the the people that have
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:57.440]  basically seized our government and so i mean i'm with the russians against
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:01.440]  starting a giant war so am i i learned from last
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:07.520]  time when uh they said that Assad bombed his own people and chemical weapons
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.120]  weapons his own people that we need to go over there and
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:16.000]  pretty much start world war three well the people wanted to do that
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.720]  and we pretty much stopped them by not giving our consent to them
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:26.960]  now that was a huge victory a couple months ago when the whole world just
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.080]  got angry and the american people across the political spectrum
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:33.920]  came together black white hispanic asian old young republican democrat
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:38.960]  libertarian conservative led by the military uh and said we're not going
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:43.440]  to do an air war for al-qaeda uh and then so obama's trying to
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:47.120]  covertly arm al-qaeda right now it's just incredible
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.280]  well we have to be careful watching the news on the television because
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:57.520]  from fox news to msnbc everybody wanted to go to war in syria on the tv but
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:02.720]  nobody wanted to go to war and by the people none of us wanted to go to war
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.360]  by the way i mean it'll be three years in december
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.360]  that the west has been spending hundreds of millions of dollars every couple
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.080]  months on the record it's more than that off record
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:16.160]  giving weapons high impact weapons is what the insiders call them
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:20.560]  high energy weapons you know missiles howlitzers rocket launchers
[01:03:20.560 --> 01:03:24.400]  they're giving them you know medium weapons high impact weapons
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:28.080]  uh to to to attack a legitimate government
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.640]  and people and then they'll blame their atrocities on Assad when
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.240]  again compared to most dictators Assad is is is very uh velvet fisted and i don't
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.480]  agree with how they run things there but he began to democratize just like libya
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:46.080]  did and they use that to then infiltrate him
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.200]  they got him in peace talks with carrie on record got him to let in the west got
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:54.560]  him to open up got him to and then look what happened
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.960]  so it's same thing with qaddafi eight years ago or nine years ago
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:02.560]  he invested their money with the west gave up his weapons worked with everybody
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.560]  let us companies in french companies in they stole the people's money
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:11.360]  that was invested in european and us banks sin and al-qaeda and set him up
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:14.720]  so what does that tell iran should they make peace deals
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.040]  no they shouldn't but they've still done it and they'll probably be set up now
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:23.360]  and i'm not for the iranian government but i'm not for new king the iranian
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:27.600]  people that are very pro america on average
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.320]  well what happened when they said we know exactly what those weapons of
[01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.120]  mass destruction are we got to go get them
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:40.160]  they were never there well you know then they argue they got taken into
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:44.080]  iran or syria the point is these countries have a right to have that
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:49.120]  and saddam used the the chemical chemical weapons on the Kurds during the
[01:04:49.120 --> 01:04:53.440]  iran iran war under cia orders and direction
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:57.280]  so if he's guilty they're guilty i'm just sick of this
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.280]  evil policies why does the united states spend the
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:04.240]  largest percentage of gdp in the world on health care
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:08.320]  why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.880]  diabetes autism and every other major disease
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:16.400]  it all comes down to one thing we are what we eat
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:21.120]  our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives
[01:05:21.120 --> 01:05:25.360]  our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:29.680]  all of this has been engineered by design we can turn the tide against the
[01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:33.040]  eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body

[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:26.400]  everyone else than anyone else clone
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:32.400]  Hitler took the guns, Stalin took the guns, Mal took the guns, and El Castro took the guns.
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.400]  You though Chavez took the guns.
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:40.400]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.

[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:07.400]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:16.400]  Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:21.400]  We have the live big weekday transmission, but that's not enough in the info war.
[01:07:21.400 --> 01:07:29.400]  Then I'm back weeknight, 7 o'clock Central with my team, Info Wars Nightly News, the tales at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:35.400]  And then of course Sunday live, 4 to 6 p.m. Central with the two hour news update transmission.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:40.400]  We're going to your phone calls, then huge new developments on obozo care.
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:44.400]  We're going to get into China. It doesn't have to cut any of their emissions.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:49.400]  Only the West does, which is an unfair trade advantage, and the globalists are all moving our factories there.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:55.400]  So that's part of that plan. We're going to look at the plan to try to get rid of the borders and have total amnesty.
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:08:02.400]  And under No Child Left Behind, they're teaching that all white people are racist, and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are racist.
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:08.400]  So you better prove you're not racist and vote to totally open the borders, show hundreds of millions of people can come in and get free welfare,
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.400]  and then get given driver's license to vote and vote to take your guns.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:16.400]  I mean, that's the basic plan, political colonization.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:20.400]  And we're going to be breaking that down as well here today.
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:26.400]  But now let's go to your calls quickly. Bob in California, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:32.400]  Everybody always listens to their radio. It's a fun thing they do.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:39.400]  Let him go. Let him go. Let's go to Chris in Florida. Chris, you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:45.400]  How are you doing, Alex? This is Chris. I went to the End of Fed rally. I met you.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:49.400]  I was one of the black guys that took a picture with you that night.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:58.400]  Well, it was great to meet all the folks that were out there. What did you think of our End of Fed rally that we first had in Dallas two days before the fifth anniversary?
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:08.400]  Beautiful. I wish I could have stayed there, but I'm a trucker, so I picked up a load from Houston, Texas, heading to Plainview, Texas,
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:15.400]  and I diverted my route to Dallas to be there with you. But I want to talk about what happened after you left.
[01:09:15.400 --> 01:09:23.400]  There was a goon squad. I know you heard about it. They showed up, and there was a nice young lady.
[01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:29.400]  You know, she had a baby, and the guys, they was lined up, one in back of each other.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:34.400]  It was like a group of six of them, but they was all together, and they was lined up one after the other.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:39.400]  And the guy, you know, you would call him a pedo if you were to see him. He literally had his hand on his gun.
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:47.400]  And I'm like, you know, look, I can still carry, man, and I didn't like what happened to you in New York.
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:54.400]  And I feel like if you was a listener, going has to have your back when these criminals are, you know, trying to take your life.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:59.400]  No, I hear you, but here's the deal. Just like Gandhi, letting them attack us gives us the moral high ground.
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:06.400]  And most police aren't bad, but historically in Guatemala or North Korea, they hire criminals, and that's what we're converting to.
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:13.400]  And they hire people that are really cowardly, on average now, who want to badge in the gun because they feel powerless,
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:17.400]  because a powerful person would be embarrassed with a woman and a child.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:23.400]  We're a very peaceful crowd out there. And then I left after an hour and a half, and I'm told then some riot police showed up,
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:29.400]  but then nothing happened. And, you know, overall, the Dallas police is thug-like as they are, and some of them were.
[01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.400]  They're nothing compared to what I've seen being arrested in New York and other areas.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:39.400]  And the Dallas police chief, on the day of the JFK event, did follow the judge's order and let us in after the events.
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:43.400]  So they just had the feds, federalized sheriff's deputies, and attack us.
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.400]  And it's all on video, and then the news lied about it, but it is frustrating.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:52.400]  But I do remember meeting you. You were talking about, you were a truck driver that drove here specifically to be at the event.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:57.400]  And yeah, we had three different marches. They were all a great success because if you don't use the First Amendment, you lose it.
[01:10:57.400 --> 01:11:01.400]  God bless you, sir. You will lose the First Amendment if you don't use it.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:09.400]  And that's why, I mean, imagine black folks and the white folks and others that marched with them in the 50s and 60s saying,
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:16.400]  you can't eat at a lunch counter, you can't ride from the bus, you can't drink out of water fountain, or you can't go to the bathroom.
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.400]  You can go to the black bathrooms, but there aren't black bathrooms anywhere.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:26.400]  I mean, it was doubly bad. You got to go in the woods, you know, behind the store.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:35.400]  Well, it's the same thing. Oh, the mayor said you can't hand out flyers anywhere in the city and you can't have signs will arrest you.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:38.400]  Well, then folks went to court and sued over it, so he had to back off.
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:43.400]  But he was still ordering the cops to tell people they could not hand out flyers, and most police wouldn't do it.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:49.400]  Like, I'd walk up to senior police and say, you know, arrest people for flyers? Nope, because it's not illegal.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:54.400]  Well, the mayor says it is. We'll talk to him then, and they start laughing and, you know, walk away.
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:12:01.400]  So look, folks, if the police violate people's rights, they're losing their own rights.
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:04.400]  It's really that simple. I mean, talk about bad luck.
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.400]  Talk about political suicide. Talk about barring down your own house. I mean, this is, come on.
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:14.400]  And by and large, most police, again, my experience on the show is we got our best tips from police,
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.400]  but it's normally medium sized cities and towns and small towns.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:23.400]  The big cities, it just gets worse. Let's go to another caller here. Let's talk to Chris.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:28.400]  I thought we'd just talk to Chris in Florida.
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:34.400]  Let's talk to Mordecai in California. Mordecai, you're on the air.
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.400]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:43.400]  One way to get more listeners is to go to our city councils, and on Tuesday I went to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:50.400]  and mentioned your show and things you were selling and such, because it's a way to magnify our efforts because it goes on the web.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.400]  But you said something that I'd like you to embellish on for five to ten minutes if you could.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:13:01.400]  I mean, it's how our troops are committing suicide when they're being forced to train the al-Qaeda troops.
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.400]  Did you say that?
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:10.400]  Yes, I mean, you know that there's a seven-fold increase, according to, I think it was Reuters did a story last year,
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:19.400]  a seven-fold increase in the previous record suicides from 1974 during the collapse in Vietnam and then the fall of Saigon.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:26.400]  And you can pull that up by searching record suicides and then talking to the troops themselves.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.400]  You've heard them call in, but I know them personally.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:36.400]  A lot of their buddies, you know, get sent for a third or fourth tour or they're told, I mean, it is U.S. forces on record training al-Qaeda at commando bases.
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:41.400]  That's mainstream news that they just killed themselves instead of speaking out against the mission.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:48.400]  And they've published letters when they kill themselves that we've read on air that have made national news of why they killed themselves.
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.400]  And they say, we're helping al-Qaeda.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.400]  You know, we run the drugs.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.400]  This is an evil mission.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:57.400]  I've done horrible things in the name of freedom, but we really serve evil.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:03.400]  And so people could say that, you know, I shouldn't do this, but this is a decision I need to make to punish myself.
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:04.400]  You know, stuff like that.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.400]  And you shouldn't kill yourself.
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.400]  You should speak out.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:12.400]  It's like if you've had an abortion and you realize it was wrong, you should speak out against abortion and save other babies.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:18.400]  Not go kill yourself or beat yourself over the head, repent for it.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:21.400]  But yeah, that's the intel on that, sir.
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:22.400]  Exactly.
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.400]  Because if they're going to kill you, they're going to kill you, but you don't know if they're going to kill you.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:26.400]  So speak out.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.400]  Speak out.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.400]  Repent and believe in Jesus.
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:30.400]  That's all you can do.
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:33.400]  Well, no, just exactly speak out and then just get out of the military.
[01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:43.400]  But I mean, look, look, look, now they brought in Qataris and Saudi special forces to train the Al Qaeda because it's come out that the U.S. military just has been refusing to do it.
[01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:49.400]  Again, these guys, it's been in the BBC and stuff where they brag in front of them.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:52.400]  I killed a bunch of you in Iraq and I'm going to kill more when I'm done.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:58.400]  And the troops are just like, I mean, these are these Al Qaeda people are arrogant folks and a lot of them speak English.
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.400]  And I mean, they are just disgusting.
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:06.400]  Have you seen all the videos of a murdering people in Egypt and Syria where they throw the little kids off the roofs?
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.400]  Have you seen them killing the Christian kids and all that?
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.400]  No, no, I haven't.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.400]  Type in Al Qaeda, Al Qaeda throwing people off roofs in Egypt.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:15.400]  You'll get it.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.400]  It's it's unbelievable.
[01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:18.400]  Unbelievable.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:33.400]  In San Jose, I went over there to the troops a couple of weeks ago and asked them about how you said that the Fort Hood was teaching the Christians to be court-martialed if they gave to Christian groups and or the Tea Party and how the Christians are.
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.400]  And they said they hadn't heard anything about it and they were against that.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.400]  That was the place over there.
[01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.400]  Well, I mean, let's be clear.
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:43.400]  What I mentioned was in Fox News, the Associated Press, we just broke it.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:49.400]  That indeed, Fort Hood, they were being taught you can't be part of the Tea Party or Evangelical, you'll be court-martialed.
[01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.400]  Anybody can just type that in.
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:54.400]  Christians threatened, Christian troops threatened with court-martialed.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.400]  All right, we'll be back with your phone calls.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.400]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:07.400]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard?
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.400]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Scowzen.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:14.400]  The U.S. isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.400]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming. They want that attack to come.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:25.400]  Joel Scowzen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:30.400]  What I tell people is that you do have time. We talk about natural disasters, the health environment.
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.400]  We talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:38.400]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states, most people won't even be ready and won't be able to get out of town.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.400]  Because there will be absolute panic.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:43.400]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.400]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.

[01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:33.400]  And the results are on record, reports documented, a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.400]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:42.400]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:14.400]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:22.400]  It has always been my belief that it's key to stand behind companies who share the same values as their fellow patriots.

[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:09.400]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:18.400]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:29.400]  Yeah, if you think the country's bankrupt now, it's more than 30 million legal aliens.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:32.400]  I've been legalized and are getting all the welfare and stuff.
[01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:38.400]  And if you don't like paying for it, you're racist.
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:46.400]  And if you don't believe known liars like Obama, that Obamacare would cut your premiums in half and wouldn't kick anybody off their health plan.
[01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:50.400]  Well, if you don't believe that, you're a racist and a conspiracy theorist.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:54.400]  You don't have to intellectually, you know, counter us.
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:58.400]  Nobody tells us, hey, good job. You were right about Obamacare.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:02.400]  No, it's like you're a racist. Obamacare is free and it really works well.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:04.400]  Conspiracy theorists shut up.
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:21.400]  It doesn't matter if 99% of the people, the hundreds I talked to Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday in Dallas on the street doing live broadcast during the radio show on the nightly news and other special broadcasts we did and other special streams we did 99%.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:33.400]  I mean, I think I ran into out of several hundred people I talked to just randomly on the streets of Dallas or at the Grassing Hole, two people out of several hundred that said they hadn't made their mind up.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:39.400]  Like 99% believed the government killed Kennedy. Criminal elements did.
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:46.400]  I ran into cops from New York, cops from Oklahoma, firemen from California, from Boston.
[01:21:46.400 --> 01:21:51.400]  You saw them on the television feed and heard them on the radio.
[01:21:51.400 --> 01:21:56.400]  Marines, army people, ran into a retired Marine Corps colonel just laughing.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:22:01.400]  Of course they killed him. Of course they shot him from the front. Back of his head blows off.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:07.400]  I mean, but again, but we still feel like we're alone.
[01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:13.400]  Because the mainstream media still has some people thinking those of us that don't buy their lives of the minority.
[01:22:13.400 --> 01:22:20.400]  Gallup poll showed last month 16% of Americans trust the mainstream media.
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:23.400]  Over 50% trust the alternative media.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:26.400]  We are the media.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.400]  Let me tell you something, folks. The big newsrooms, the TV stations, the newspapers, they're all going bankrupt.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:33.400]  And they're not going bankrupt because of the internet, folks.
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:40.400]  If they were putting out real news and real research, they'd be number one with the money and the facilities and what they had.
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:48.400]  And instead, all these new real journalists and researchers and pundits are rising up, building operations that are growing like ours.
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:23:00.400]  Info wars is exploding with the traffic to our websites, to the radio stations that pick us up, to the credibility.
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:08.400]  And we're not the only ones. There are hundreds of groups that you could call liberal, conservative, libertarian, but that are pro-liberty.
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:11.400]  And who actually report on what's going on.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:15.400]  Maybe they have their own swan or perspective. Everybody does. You can't help that.
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:18.400]  But at least it's not pure lies.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:24.400]  And we are dominating the corporatist, dinosaur, kleptocrat, state-run media.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:27.400]  But the state-run media is still arrogant.
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:30.400]  I'm going to get into that later. I want to go back to your calls right now.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:38.400]  I've got the immigration news here, but right now we're going to Steve in Ohio, then Mark, Jake, John, Clifford, Dee, and Edward.
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.400]  Steve, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.400]  How's it going tonight, Alex?
[01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.400]  All right, brother. Thanks for calling.
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:50.400]  I watched you guys over there at the grassy knoll.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:24:01.400]  And I wish the guys could have heard me because I was desperately trying to think of a way to get a hold of you guys to tell you to look behind you.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:13.400]  Because right behind you, as they were pushing you guys back from the fence, there was about 150 to 175 more guys standing back there.
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:18.400]  They were trying to cut you guys off and push it to the left for some reason.
[01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:21.400]  I don't know what was to your left.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:26.400]  No, I know. The Dallas Sheriff's Department, with the Dallas police literally going,
[01:24:26.400 --> 01:24:28.400]  What are you doing? They're supposed to be here.
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.400]  The police chief had sent us there. It wasn't a setup.
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:34.400]  We now know the Dallas police were freaked out after this happened.
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:39.400]  In fact, I'm going to tell the story later. The point is, is that they were trying to push us up against the building.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:43.400]  And the people, they got up against buildings, people that weren't resisting them.
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:47.400]  Like people with their kids, little kids were crying, being shoved, and they got harder and harder.
[01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:50.400]  People were falling down. They weren't even resisting.
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:53.400]  And they didn't even say go before they started.
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:56.400]  And they were trying to push us back towards the left and your right.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:59.400]  There were more deputies. They were trying to kettle us.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:06.400]  That's what members of our crew were pointing out, Rob Do and others, that they were trying to kettle us.
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:11.400]  And John Baum was watching from the hotel because he was going up to the elevator and heard two senior deputies going,
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:14.400]  Yeah, that troublemaker Jones is out there. We're going to get him.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:16.400]  And yeah, he's trying to mess up the memorial.
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:18.400]  The memorial had been over by then, at that time, about an hour.
[01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:21.400]  And it was totally dead out there. No one out there.
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:22.400]  The police chief's like, you're right.
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:26.400]  Judge says we're supposed to open up the barricades after the memorial's cleaned out.
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:28.400]  We'll open up dealing for you in 30 minutes after that.
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:30.400]  Appreciate you, Mr. Jones.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:33.400]  And the guy was like really smiling at me in nice body language.
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:37.400]  I didn't know it was the police chief. And I later looked him up as the police chief.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:40.400]  He sent us in. We come back and senior police were like, shame on you.
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:43.400]  They go, it's not us. It's the sheriff's deputies.
[01:25:43.400 --> 01:25:45.400]  But so you were watching the live streams.
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:49.400]  I haven't had time to watch any of this. I was in the middle of it. What did you see?
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.400]  Well, I saw him. I saw him.
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:55.400]  Number one, they were the one time they were trying to corral you.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:01.400]  Number two, I saw the little bald headed dude, the little fat, perky pig looking guy.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:03.400]  The punch in the stomach. Yes.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.400]  Oh, I saw him playing his day.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:11.400]  By the way, we've been calling him a pig monster or a goblin, not because he's a cop.
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:15.400]  He was like five feet tall, 400 pounds.
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.400]  Yeah, he kind of looked like a perky pig.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:19.400]  Yeah.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:23.400]  Yeah. And I saw that playing his day.
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:27.400]  Well, that was the deal. They started it out by punching me in the stomach first.
[01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:30.400]  And they had three cops shoving me, twisting my arm behind my back.
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:34.400]  And I've now seen part of the video. I can't watch it all. It makes me too angry.
[01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:38.400]  And I'm like, hey, what's wrong? They let us in here. They're supposed to.
[01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:43.400]  And this is 30 minutes after we're let in just sitting there waiting to go into Dealey Plaza itself.
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:50.400]  I know it's amazing. I was pretty blown away because I've seen, you know, one guy threw a bottle at the cops and they attack everybody and that's wrong.
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:54.400]  But at least something happened. We did nothing. We were assaulted.
[01:26:54.400 --> 01:27:00.400]  And I, and then, of course, I got mad once I saw him pushing kids and then I, I said, all right, that's it.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:02.400]  I've had enough. And I said, everybody, let's just get ready.
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:05.400]  And then somebody gave them an order back off as soon as we were ready to fight them.
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:10.400]  The weird thing was, I made the decision. I said, all right, everybody, they want it. They're going to get it because I saw them attacking this little girl.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:14.400]  And then I felt shamed that I was cowardly letting them do this.
[01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:18.400]  Then they backed off. It was very weird, very weird. What do you think was going on?
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:29.400]  You know, something, I don't know. I got like three or four different types of feelings, you know, like it's, it's really strange.
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:33.400]  It's like you said, they said that you were allowed in. I watched them open it up.
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:42.400]  You guys started to go in and then a bunch of them just said, there ain't no way in heck you're, you're out of here.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:50.400]  And then I was, and then I watched a little bit further and then that's when they started, you know, the physical.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:55.400]  And I did see the guy with the guy with a little four year old girl on his shoulders.
[01:27:55.400 --> 01:28:00.400]  They pushed him and she fell off his shoulder backwards.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:07.400]  See, I was told she fell off at the ground. I didn't see that. I saw him with her crying and the cops still shoving him.
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:14.400]  Man, I tell you, I'm, I tell you, I'm a coward. This country's gone. We should let them beat up little girls now.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:18.400]  It's all over. This country's done. This country's done, man.
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:26.400]  If I was active duty again, Alex, you also know me as Sergeant Freedom.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:33.400]  If I was active duty again with my people, those cops would have never touched any one of you.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:38.400]  I can guarantee it. I just can't believe it wasn't like they were accidentally shoving little kids.
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:42.400]  It was like giant police attacking children. We got to go through all the footage.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:47.400]  I just can't even, I can't even watch it. I just can't, I can't even look at it.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:53.400]  I just can't believe how screwed up this country is the government runs al-Qaeda, the government runs the drugs,
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:29:00.400]  the feds federalize this special unit of county police to attack us. It's just sick.

[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:07.400]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard.
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:10.400]  Renowned author and expert Joel Scowzen.
[01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:14.400]  The U.S. isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:19.400]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming. They want that attack to come.
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:25.400]  Joel Scowzen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:30.400]  What I tell people is that you do have time. We talk about natural disasters, the health environment,
[01:30:30.400 --> 01:30:35.400]  we talk about pollution, the water quality. My personal experience about being in every one of these states,
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:40.400]  most people won't even be ready and won't be able to get out of town because there will be absolute panic.
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:46.400]  There is no preparedness without strategy. This Christmas give the gift of preparedness.

[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:15.400]  As you might remember, this is the company that stood up to the DHS and exposed FEMA's secret plan to begin hoarding emergency survival food.

[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:04.400]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:12.400]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet, the highest rates of diabetes, autism and every other major disease?
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:20.400]  It all comes down to one thing. We are what we eat. Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:27.400]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff. All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:34.400]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:28.400]  This is Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:38.400]  Alright, I'm going to go back to your phone calls. We're going to go through all the footage we have. We streamed four different live streams.
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:46.400]  Sometimes simultaneously, usually about two at a time, out to you streams. So many of you saw it. I was there. I haven't watched much of it.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:57.400]  Quite frankly, I've tried to look at it and I did at a point when they kept attacking people and I found out they were pushing people and I saw them pushing some crying little kid.
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:04.400]  I threw down a microphone and I said, come on, let's go, you cowards. And then the police actually ran. They scattered like roaches.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:15.400]  We have this whole video. It was weird. They like snuck attack us, pushed us 200 yards around the corner from the original barricades where the Dallas police chief ordered them open for us.
[01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:26.400]  And then the federalized, we later confirmed, the Dallas police told us what we went and checked and it's true, the federalized sheriff has special units for special events that were under the feds.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:34.400]  They came out of the federal building garage, came over, the Dallas police are like, what are you doing? They're supposed to be here. The thing's over.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:47.400]  And they started talking and then they just ignored those police pushed in front of them. And I remember because it was about 60 or 70 of us by that point because we had about 300 folks that met us to rally.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:54.400]  This was like four hours later because we were live before the radio show began streaming about an hour before and we done three hours of radio.
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:59.400]  We'd already gone into overdrive. It was past two o'clock. The event had been over for almost an hour.
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:10.400]  They'd opened up the first line of barricades. We hadn't even gotten to Dealey Plaza yet. We're totally peaceful just sitting there waiting for about 20 minutes with the Dallas police actually having friendly discussions with them.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:18.400]  But I made one joke at a federal protective services guy that was bugging his eyes out and acting really weird and trying to give the Dallas police orders and whispering.
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:31.400]  And I said, oh, it's the royalty, the royal fed. He got mad, went off and then brought the federalized people. And so what if I'm sitting there making jokes and stuff?
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:40.400]  I mean, I'm a human being. I have a first amendment on a scale of one to 10, one being the nicest demonstration or crowd, 10 being the meanest.
[01:35:40.400 --> 01:35:49.400]  We were about a two and the Dallas police were about a two. We weren't perfect. They weren't perfect, but about as good as you could imagine. I mean, that's what happened.
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:57.400]  And we were out there demonstrating two days before that with the Dallas police. And I told the Dallas police, I said, I'm not getting a permit. It's unconstitutional.
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:03.400]  I'm not going to block streets and I'm not going to bullhorn during the memorial. I don't want to take it over. That would look bad.
[01:36:03.400 --> 01:36:14.400]  But afterwards the judges rule, we get to go in. They're like, all right, Alex, but don't do it. We're going to arrest you. That was all on TV and radio with the police detective.
[01:36:14.400 --> 01:36:21.400]  So then I go up. They had two cops during the hour long ceremony standing beside me about halfway through. They just left.
[01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:27.400]  They figured out, I guess they went and looked up the fact that I go to England. I go to Canada. I always do what I say I'm going to do.
[01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:34.400]  I mean, I'm just a man of my word here. I'm here to uphold free speech, folks, and speak out against the globalist. I have that right.
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:38.400]  That's what keeps us free is all of us speaking out. You have First Amendment as well.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:45.400]  And so then the Dallas police chief comes out and I thought, I think that's the chief way everybody's acting and the insignia she's got.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:49.400]  He can already said, yeah, I know you're supposed to be let in. Let me make some calls, make sure it's time to do that.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:55.400]  And 30 minutes later, he comes back and he goes, yep, they're opening up all the barricades right now. So it's going in.
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:37:05.400]  We go in and I could hear him talking 30 minutes before he goes, no, no, we are supposed to, but let me get the green light that everybody's cleared out first.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:08.400]  So they're not getting mixed up with the folks leaving. He's like six feet from me.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:14.400]  In fact, we probably have audio of this when I was broadcasting. The police chiefs right there over the line because we marched right up where the main police group was.
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:20.400]  And they had the jumbo trons and the loudspeakers for folks that weren't allowed in to hear it because a lot of Dallas wasn't allowed in.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:26.400]  You have to agree with the official story to get in. And then we get let in. I'm kind of going back and forth in the story.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:34.400]  That's how it is when you tell a true story. It's just, there's all these memories and the, so we're there about 20 minutes or so.
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:41.400]  We've gone through one of the open barricades. Now we're waiting to go into Dealey Plaza. Not that it even matters, but just to point out, here's where they have the staged event.
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:46.400]  Here's where they kept everybody out. It was totally cleared out by then, you know, how fast the stadium clears out.
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:55.400]  They cleared out faster than that. I mean, it cleared out in like five minutes. We were standing there for, you know, 40 minutes before we got let in and about 20 minutes before that.
[01:37:55.400 --> 01:38:01.400]  So it was about an hour. It's just totally clear. The streets are open. The barricades are open. The Dallas cops are sitting there bored.
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:07.400]  I'm going, Hey, you hungry? Yeah. Well, the sooner they let us in, the sooner you can go in. We just, we've already been here yesterday bull-earning.
[01:38:07.400 --> 01:38:13.400]  We just don't like the fact they closed it down. How's it going? Some cops are like, Hey, Alex, how you doing? These are Dallas cops.
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:20.400]  Here come the people in the black uniforms and I hear booing to my left and I go, Hey, don't boo the police. This was live on the radio.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:29.400]  Don't boo the police. All of a sudden, this really evil looking cop comes up. Two of them. They get right in my face and they're looking at me like they absolutely hate me.
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:40.400]  They look like convicts, bad guys out of movies, not only normal cops and they've got their name tags off and I go and I've seen this video and the video is on infowords.com.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:48.400]  I go, Hey, what's going on? We were let in here. We're supposed to be here. Boom. Punches me right in the stomach.
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:57.400]  Well, luckily it already tensed up instinctively. Didn't even really hurt. And you see me start laughing on the video because this cop looks so evil and so pathetic.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:04.400]  But then they start twisting my arm. My back is shoving me. I see him shove some guy into a sign and go move, move while he's bleeding, ramming his head in.
[01:39:04.400 --> 01:39:11.400]  And then I look over and see some little girl crying and all this stuff. And John, while I'm talking, you could show some of the video of that and show some of the stills.
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:23.400]  I saw him choking women, choking men. A very famous person was there. I can now announce Stanley Kubrick's daughter, a big filmmaker in her own right, Vivian Kubrick.
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:30.400]  And you can see the guy in red right there on screen being choked. By the way, we interviewed Vivian Kubrick. We already hung out with her in the night before.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:36.400]  She's not done interviews, but once in like a decade, Stanley Kubrick's daughter who worked on so many of his films with him.
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:41.400]  We have a big interview with her. This can premiere on the radio tomorrow. That'll be national news, by the way.
[01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:46.400]  But long story short, she was all the way back, never even got involved in it.
[01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:53.400]  Cops came over and would basically punch her in the back and do pressure points. And she was going and they were still attacking her.
[01:39:53.400 --> 01:40:01.400]  So all of this is happening, total insanity, and it just got weirder and weirder and weirder.
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:09.400]  And the video you're seeing is just when it started. It got worse and worse and worse as it went all the way down the street and around the corner.
[01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:18.400]  And I'm told we have the footage, but we're converting it now because it's high def of the girl falling off being pushed off her dad's shoulder and all the rest of it.
[01:40:18.400 --> 01:40:25.400]  And with these police that just absolutely wanted to physically attack us.
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:35.400]  And so we're going to have all that for folks in the next few days, but everybody saw the live feeds and that's basically what happened there.
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:40.400]  But it's a great example of it didn't matter what David O Brown did.
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:49.400]  It didn't matter what the Dallas judge said that, no, the mayor can't keep people out two days before and two days after out of the Dealey Plaza area.
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:52.400]  You got to open it up as soon as it's done.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:55.400]  And you can't stop people from handing on flyers.
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:41:01.400]  And so the police followed the Constitution, did what they were supposed to do, let us in.
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:04.400]  And the Fed said, it doesn't matter what you want.
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:07.400]  We're going to go attack Alex Jones.
[01:41:07.400 --> 01:41:11.400]  John Brown in and then also Nico who John Brown was on the ground.
[01:41:11.400 --> 01:41:15.400]  Nico was here running the show live in Austin with mixing all these different live feeds.
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:17.400]  We had a video and audio.
[01:41:17.400 --> 01:41:20.400]  John, tell folks briefly you're getting on the elevator.
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:22.400]  You hear two senior deputies with the feds.
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.400]  What did they say about me?
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:30.400]  And then you went up to the room to look out to see what was going to happen as we had that as a bird's eye view of the hotel from just 200 yards away.
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:34.400]  You shot the video that we have that's online of what happened from above.
[01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.400]  They said about me because the ceremony had been done for an hour.
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:38.400]  Nobody was there.
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:42.400]  But in their own minds, you heard them say he's disrupted the ceremony.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.400]  We're going to get him.
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:53.400]  Yeah, there were two deputies sitting there in the lobby of the hotel Lawrence and they both were talking about how you were in extremists and how you were ruining everything.
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:56.400]  And, you know, how you were a jerk.
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:02.400]  And as I got onto the elevator and went up to see what was going on, I saw you guys coming across the street.
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:05.400]  And that's where I started to get the footage from the top floor.
[01:42:05.400 --> 01:42:06.400]  Let's bring in Nico.
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.400]  We're going to break in a minute.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:08.400]  But Nico, I mean, you were there.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:09.400]  You saw it.
[01:42:09.400 --> 01:42:10.400]  There's video as well.
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:12.400]  But you heard me say, hey, don't boo it to police.
[01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:13.400]  Remember that?
[01:42:13.400 --> 01:42:15.400]  And then the next I get punched in the stomach for saying that.
[01:42:15.400 --> 01:42:17.400]  Yeah, they totally caught you guys off guard.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:20.400]  You heard people booing and you were like, why are people booing?
[01:42:20.400 --> 01:42:21.400]  We're not booing.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:22.400]  We're not bad people.
[01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:23.400]  You know, what's going on here?
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:24.400]  You know, and they just started pushing you.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:25.400]  They didn't ask anybody to leave.
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:28.400]  They just started pushing.
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:29.400]  That's right.
[01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:34.400]  And again, the footage we have, the first video we live stream, that's pretty bad.
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:35.400]  There's a bunch of other live streams.
[01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:36.400]  I haven't looked at it all.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.400]  It's hours of stuff combined.
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:44.400]  But I mean, what I saw was ramming heads in the concrete blood, punching people in the face, punching me.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.400]  We've got them shoving and attacking people.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.400]  But it was just really disgusting.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.400]  And it was illegal what they did.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:53.400]  If you did that to cops, you'd be charged with felonies.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.400]  So now everything's backwards with the government's God.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.400]  We're scum just like North Korea or Mexico.

[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:06.400]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine,
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:10.400]  a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.400]  Guess what else is in a halogen family?
[01:45:12.400 --> 01:45:13.400]  Fluoride.
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:22.400]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:28.400]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record, reports documented,
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:33.400]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[01:45:33.400 --> 01:45:35.400]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:42.400]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:47.400]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at infowarslife.com.
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:52.400]  Infowars life, Survival Shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.

[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:05.400]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty good-sized meal,
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:07.400]  that I was still starving.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:13.400]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:19.400]  and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:25.400]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:46:25.400 --> 01:46:31.400]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:35.400]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need,

[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:34.400]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting Worldwide.
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:36.400]  You know, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:39.400]  That reminds me of my buddy, Mike Judge, and me back in town this week from LA.
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.400]  We're gonna have to go out and see some live music or something, Thanksgiving.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:46.400]  Me and Walden were talking about hooking up with him and Scotty.
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:50.400]  As I tell you, wherever the best music is, Mike Judge knows where it's at.
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:58.400]  My good buddy, Jimmy Vaughn, who's a legendary guitarist and blues icon who got his brother, Stevie Ray Vaughn, started in music,
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:02.400]  has said that Mike Judge is one of the best guitar players he knows.
[01:48:02.400 --> 01:48:08.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, he's not just the icon of Beavis and Budhead Idiocracy, King of the Hill and so much more,
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:10.400]  and he's a great Texan as well.
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:15.400]  Ladies, I don't know, just every time I hear that, that's the real Mike Judge doing that intro right there.
[01:48:15.400 --> 01:48:19.400]  We can share an interview with him in video on infowarsteam.com.
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:21.400]  Listen, bottom line, this is what's happening.
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:31.400]  There's always a struggle between tyranny and liberty, and evil is always trying to take over organizations.
[01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:36.400]  And America's future rises and falls with the citizens acting like free humans.
[01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:39.400]  If you act like slaves, you'll be slaves.
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:43.400]  But our destiny also rises and falls with the police and the military.
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:50.400]  And I gotta say, versus even the common citizens, the police anybody, the best people,
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:57.400]  and I didn't even talk about this the last six, seven years until I discovered it, the best are our military.
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:01.400]  They are the most awake, the most informed, because they've been there, folks.
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:03.400]  They've seen what's going on behind the curtain.
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:08.400]  And even though I criticize police all day, because they have an important role,
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:13.400]  and the globalists are trying to corrupt them right now, they need to get themselves together
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:19.400]  and really face up to the fact, by every yardstick America's going into tyranny.
[01:49:19.400 --> 01:49:26.400]  And if you can't hand out flyers in Dallas, Texas, or have signs, like this one I'm holding for TV viewers,
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:31.400]  says the establishment killed me 50 years ago, and now they're killing free speech with a picture of Kennedy,
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:33.400]  the people are fighting back.
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:39.400]  I mean, they tried to stop us from handing out flyers and having signs that said this until the judge intervened.
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:42.400]  And this just shows that the mayor is not the dictator of Dallas.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:47.400]  And they're trying this stuff from Australia to Canada, from the United States to Germany, from Mexico to you name it.
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:49.400]  This is what happens.
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:50.400]  Remember Tiananmen Square?
[01:49:50.400 --> 01:49:52.400]  In fact, I sent you guys the image.
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:54.400]  It's on our Twitter account, too.
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.400]  But it's on our live JFK coverage page.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:01.400]  The fight for free speech is type in the fight for free speech, JFKandForwards.com.
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:06.400]  You can see the promo we made Wednesday when I left of Tiananmen Square in the tank saying,
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:08.400]  don't let this happen in Dallas.
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:10.400]  And they really tried to do that in Dallas.
[01:50:10.400 --> 01:50:17.400]  If we would have physically fought back like the Chinese people did, if we would have resisted that tyranny,
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:20.400]  then they would have brought in guns and then tanks.
[01:50:20.400 --> 01:50:22.400]  I mean, it could have turned into Tiananmen Square.
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:24.400]  And then that would turn into 1776.
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:27.400]  This won't go like China where they're disarmed.
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:29.400]  I don't have any dreams of that happening.
[01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:31.400]  I don't want a violent revolution.
[01:50:31.400 --> 01:50:37.400]  But as Kennedy said, those that make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:40.400]  It comes down to that.
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:46.400]  And there is a criminal revolution happening by foreign banks and corporations that have diplomatic community
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:54.400]  that are anti-free market combine operators that are abolishing our bill of rights and our Constitution right now.
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:58.400]  And if they can control the government, they can control the markets and shut down their competition.
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:02.400]  We're going into fascism on the top, socialism on the bottom.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.400]  That's the real political structure.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:05.400]  They're above the law.
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:07.400]  We have to change that.
[01:51:07.400 --> 01:51:12.400]  And it just comes down to this.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:15.400]  The feds wanted us to know we don't have free speech.
[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:22.400]  It was the feds in Seattle in 99 that hired anarchists to attack the police so they could then attack the entire crowd of 60,000.
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:25.400]  It's the feds caught shipping guns into Mexico to blame the Second Amendment.
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:27.400]  It's the feds caught running al-Qaeda.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:28.400]  They're not feds.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:30.400]  They're criminals in the federal government.
[01:51:30.400 --> 01:51:32.400]  There's a lot of good people in the federal government.
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:36.400]  I had CIA people come up to me and I could tell they were real CIA.
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:38.400]  I had FBI, federal marshals.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:41.400]  I had federal protective services in uniform.
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:45.400]  But once our cameras are off, say, listen, we appreciate what we're doing for America and our freedom.
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:46.400]  We're really concerned too.
[01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.400]  And we don't like what's going on here.
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:49.400]  But it didn't matter.
[01:51:49.400 --> 01:51:56.400]  They had a group of 50 guns from the sheriff's department that looked like they'd been bathing in steroids to come attack us.
[01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.400]  Attack us.
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:00.400]  And attack little kids.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.400]  So, you know what?
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:10.400]  I feel sorry for the people that if the Civil War does start, man, I'll tell you what, all you tough guys that have been busy pulling old ladies over and stuff.
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:12.400]  You got another thing coming.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:21.400]  And the Special Forces folks out there on record, they say if it starts, you try some purge, they're going to go right at the tip of the spear.
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:28.400]  And they say that's you and all I know is I'm going to keep my head down and stay out of it.
[01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.400]  I mean, I cannot believe what's happened here.
[01:52:30.400 --> 01:52:34.400]  They are teaching children in public school that Mao Zedong is a great guy.
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:38.400]  Mao Zedong killed 80 plus million people, folks.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:43.400]  This country has been overrun by criminals and they're trying to get the police to do horrible things.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:53.400]  And my God, have some simple common sense, self-preservation police and act more like the military and start saying no to all this BS.
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:58.400]  The military told Obama, we're not going to back Al Qaeda in Syria. We're done.
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:02.400]  And even the hawk they appointed, because he did whatever he was told, said no.
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:09.400]  The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, because there was a good chance nuclear war was going to happen.
[01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:13.400]  This isn't a game. The whole world is lining up for another world war, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:18.400]  Historically, even mainline analysts are saying it and I get scared to death watching this happen.
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:21.400]  I just want to have prosperity. I want to have a future.
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:23.400]  I don't want a civil war to start.
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:25.400]  But I mean, you can't keep.
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:31.400]  It really freaked me out because when these cops were attacking and pushing people even past the second barricade,
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:33.400]  we've been led in by the Dallas police chief.
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:37.400]  And here were the feds with their minions violating the law attacking us.
[01:53:37.400 --> 01:53:42.400]  I was clicking that, my God, I'm not afraid of these people at all.
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.400]  I'm afraid of what I'm about to do.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:50.400]  And I knew full well what type of folks were in the crowd and what was going to happen.
[01:53:50.400 --> 01:53:55.400]  But we were the better men there and the better women and the better children.
[01:53:55.400 --> 01:53:58.400]  And I don't want to think of the police as bad. I don't hate the police.
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:05.400]  I'm ashamed as an American that we've fallen this far. I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed.
[01:54:05.400 --> 01:54:07.400]  I know we have loaded phone lines.
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:11.400]  Mark in Kentucky, Jake, John, Clifford D., Edward Arthur, Brandon.
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.400]  I don't think we can do overdrive.
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.400]  Can we do a little bit overdrive to be sure to get to all these calls?
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:17.400]  I don't know.
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:21.400]  I need to plug too. We fund ourselves not with taxpayer money like MSNBC or MPR.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:26.400]  MSNBC gets taxpayer money too, stimulus money with high quality products.
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:32.400]  Over a decade ago, I discovered my favorite coffee, Chiapin, Shade Grown, Mountain Coffee,
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:36.400]  and High Mountain Coffee, better than Guatemala than my favorite previous.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:40.400]  But it was gourmet and super expensive, about double the price of this.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:43.400]  Then I found another brand that was less but not quite as good.
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:51.400]  I finally secured directly from Mexico, roasted by a great roasting house in Colorado,
[01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:55.400]  the best coffee I believe out there, Arabica beans.
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:55:00.400]  We have one that's immune support with these high quality mushrooms that are on record to boost immunity.
[01:55:00.400 --> 01:55:05.400]  We have American Immune Support 100% Organic Blend Mushroom Roast.
[01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:09.400]  We have that available by the pound at infowarsstore.com.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:13.400]  It's the latest product from infowarslife.com. You can also find it there.
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:16.400]  And Wake Up America Patriot Blend 100% Organic.
[01:55:16.400 --> 01:55:18.400]  And you can read all about it and everything.
[01:55:18.400 --> 01:55:21.400]  I'm going to do a whole video breaking it down, but we got this stuff about a week early.
[01:55:21.400 --> 01:55:24.400]  It took me two years. One deal fell through to get this.
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:29.400]  I do have a limit. Click on some of the photos of the folks in Colorado hand roasting it.
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:31.400]  Turns out the folks hand roasting it.
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:34.400]  This is only, it turns out they're already infowars listeners.
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:38.400]  I finally got the connection to Mexico to get this.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:41.400]  And again, folks, I could sell this for double the price.
[01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:45.400]  This is the most gourmet coffee. This is my favorite.
[01:55:45.400 --> 01:55:52.400]  Get a bag, support the infowars, $17.95 for the regular pound Patriot Blend, $19.95 for the mushroom.
[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:54.400]  It's got all the special immune boosting mushrooms.
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:55:59.400]  Go read all the details at infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com. Infowarslife.com will lead you directly to it.
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:08.400]  It's our second product on top of the nascent iodine that we just, normal iodine folks bound and is chemically based and tastes absolutely horrible.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:12.400]  This is proprietary patented National Academy of Sciences iodine.
[01:56:12.400 --> 01:56:16.400]  That's just amazing for the glands and the rest of the body and radiation protection.
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:24.400]  Infowarslife.com will call toll free 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.

[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:41.400]  Guys, can we do commercial free overdrive to take calls?
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:43.400]  Or do we have to end it? Or is it not? We can, okay.
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:46.400]  I know I got to pre-program the computers for you guys to do that.
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:54.400]  We're going to end on our AM and FM stations here and go to overdrive infowars.com forward slash show for the video and free audio feeds.
[01:56:54.400 --> 01:56:59.400]  If you're a radio listener, we're going to do about 20 minutes and I go to my dad's birthday. His birthday is actually at 6.30.
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:09.400]  But I'm going to do about 15 minutes of overdrive because I will go to Jake and John and Clifford and Mark and Brandon and Arthur and Edward and Dee and everybody else when we go to break here in a moment.
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:17.400]  But I saw in Dallas in the 50th anniversary of the murder of JFK, the dichotomy of the Dallas police.
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:27.400]  They're not perfect, but they were acting professionally, had nice uniforms, were polite, looked good, were well-spoken and were somewhat friendly.
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:37.400]  Compared to the sheriff's department, who were federal goons coming out of a federal building who looked like they'd been grown in some type of goblin dish.
[01:57:37.400 --> 01:57:41.400]  You know, by Soromon or something, and who were enjoying attacking children.
[01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:44.400]  I mean, I just, that's the choice we have, America.
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:58:12.400]  You want to be honorable or you want to be an absolute goon? The video is all on Infowars.com.
[01:58:12.400 --> 01:58:16.400]  This film exposes the fraud that Obama is like nothing I've seen.
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:20.400]  If you want to know who Obama's real daddy is, this is the film for you.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:24.400]  Don't forget, your purchase supports our broadcast and our growing media network.

[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:31.400]  None dare call a conspiracy by Gary Allen, the book that woke me up.
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:35.400]  We're also carrying behind the green mask, You and Agenda 21 by Rosa Corey.
[01:58:35.400 --> 01:58:38.400]  This book is coffin nails to the globalist takeover.
[01:58:38.400 --> 01:58:42.400]  The greater good, the most professional and up-to-date film I've ever seen,
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:45.400]  exposing the scourge that is vaccines.
[01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:50.400]  These titles and a lot more are all available at Infowarshop.com.
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:57.400]  Strategic relocation is a systematic way to think strategically in the future about how do I safeguard?
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:59:00.400]  Renowned author and expert, Joel Scowzen.
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:04.400]  The U.S. isn't building huge underground bases and bunkers because of some terrorist threat.
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:09.400]  They know that a massive nuclear attack is coming. They want that attack to come.
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:15.400]  Joel Scowzen is renowned as one of the world's foremost experts in strategic relocation and the securing of your home.
[01:59:15.400 --> 01:59:21.400]  What I tell people is that you do have time. We talk about natural disasters, the health environment,
[01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:23.400]  we talk about pollution, the water quality.
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:26.400]  My personal experience about being in every one of these states,
[01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:31.400]  most people won't even be ready and won't be able to get out of town because there'll be absolute panic.
[01:59:31.400 --> 01:59:34.400]  There is no preparedness without strategy.
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:37.400]  This Christmas, give the gift of preparedness.
[01:59:37.400 --> 01:59:41.400]  Strategic relocation film with Joel Scowzen and Alex Jones.
[01:59:41.400 --> 02:00:07.400]  Available only at Infowarshop.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:12.400]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:21.400]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:28.400]  If you want to understand my perspective, then I'm going to your phone calls on why I've been so upset over the years.
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:32.400]  If you've read history books or you know about the founding of the country or you know about other nations,
[02:00:32.400 --> 02:00:38.400]  and I just got interested in that as a small child watching PBS and my dad read to me about history and my mom,
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:41.400]  then you know the America is going into tyranny.
[02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:47.400]  If you were brought up by television and I never warned you or mainstream television, then you don't know.
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:51.400]  But I mean, by every yardstick, this is tyranny.
[02:00:51.400 --> 02:00:54.400]  Everything we saw in third world countries is now happening here.
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:56.400]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:01:03.400]  You know, I kind of halfway plugged this tonight. I should have rolled it out next week with an official promo video to really tell you how good this is.
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:07.400]  But since I started talking about it, let me just spend a few minutes talking about this because I'm so excited.
[02:01:07.400 --> 02:01:13.400]  I told you two years ago I was coming out with coffee, then the deal fell through.
[02:01:13.400 --> 02:01:17.400]  Because it turned out this super gourmet coffee that I love so much and maybe you're not going to like it.
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:19.400]  But everybody I know thinks this is great coffee.
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:23.400]  Folks, I've been having the office having this gourmet coffee before I ever got it.
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:26.400]  Branded to us. I mean, is this good coffee?
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:29.400]  I didn't tell you I was going to ask you, are you on air?
[02:01:29.400 --> 02:01:31.400]  Now, go ahead and punch yourself up, Nico.
[02:01:31.400 --> 02:01:36.400]  Give me your honest, I didn't tell you I was going to do this, give me your honest take on the coffee.
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:39.400]  Because the office coffee we've had all these years is, even though it's expensive, I like it.
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:42.400]  It's the exact same coffee we have here at half the price.
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:44.400]  Have you liked the coffee that the office has had so far?
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:46.400]  Yeah, it's great.
[02:01:46.400 --> 02:01:50.400]  Tim came in with a whole bunch of samples and we all sort of just sat around and like,
[02:01:50.400 --> 02:01:54.400]  tried to distinguish the nuances of each of the flavors.
[02:01:54.400 --> 02:02:00.400]  Sure, to be specific, varieties of the coffee I'd already been having here for us is what I'm saying.
[02:02:00.400 --> 02:02:02.400]  Absolutely.
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:06.400]  But then I was complaining how expensive it was and trying to, but go ahead and make your point about it.
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:11.400]  No, it's great. I mean, like, I'm not a coffee connoisseur, but I mean, I can't get through the day without it.
[02:02:11.400 --> 02:02:14.400]  And this is, it's where it needs to be. It's right on point.
[02:02:14.400 --> 02:02:16.400]  And it supports the info war.
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:20.400]  If I want to just read to you about these two coffees, then I'm going to your phone calls.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:23.400]  Here's the Wake Up America Patriot blend.
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:28.400]  And the whole office drank the 10 or 15 different varieties of this inside on the best mix.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:30.400]  And I concur with their analysis.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:38.400]  Our custom roasted Patriot coffee is made from the finest certified organic Arabica beans.
[02:02:38.400 --> 02:02:41.400]  And again, if you guys document cam, I'll show them the back of the bag. There it is.
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:46.400]  Our custom roasted Patriot coffee is made from the finest certified organic Arabica beans.
[02:02:46.400 --> 02:02:53.400]  The spirit of the 1776 revolution is truly alive with this exceptional Wake Up America Patriot blend.
[02:02:53.400 --> 02:03:02.400]  Our founders forged this nation with guts and determination and is with that same spirit that info wars battles for liberty, honor, and the freedoms of Patriots like you everywhere.
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:08.400]  For 18 years, Alex Jones has been fighting to awaken the sleeping giant that is free humanity until I wrote this.
[02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:13.400]  You can get an incredible cup of coffee and support the info war and a Wake Up America.
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:19.400]  And it's been lovingly prepared by InterHealth Botanicals who imports it and then roasted custom by hand.
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:21.400]  We have the photos of that on the site.
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:23.400]  100% organic Arabica coffee beans.
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:31.400]  Oregon Tilt has the certification that is the highest organic certification, the highest organic.
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:33.400]  And you've also got to get the farmer.
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:35.400]  This is beyond fair trade.
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:40.400]  This is total Chiapas Farmer Co-op 110%.
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:44.400]  Okay, so and it's also USDA organic certified.
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:48.400]  One pound and it's $17 for this.
[02:03:48.400 --> 02:03:50.400]  If you want the mushrooms, they cost us a lot.
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:54.400]  It's 1995 and that's moderate for gourmet coffee.
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:59.400]  The stuff we were getting was basically like $35 a pound or almost double this.
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:01.400]  It's exact same beans.
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:03.400]  And there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:03.400 --> 02:04:05.400]  And it's a medium roast on both of these.
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:07.400]  That's what we all liked.
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:15.400]  And it's available at infowarstore.com or infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-33139.
[02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:17.400]  But there's my verdict down on it.
[02:04:17.400 --> 02:04:20.400]  We're going to bring you all the best products at infowarslife.com.
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:22.400]  Okay, I'm going to shut up now.
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:25.400]  Let's go to Jake and Georgia then who's been holding them.
[02:04:25.400 --> 02:04:28.400]  Then Mark and then everybody else and then John.
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:30.400]  Go ahead, Jake, you're on the air.
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:33.400]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call, man. How's it going?
[02:04:33.400 --> 02:04:35.400]  Pretty good, brother. Thanks for holding.
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:37.400]  Hey, I just wanted to...
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:44.400]  I wanted to commend you on real leadership and an activist role and your response to the police.
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:46.400]  I mean, that's what you're supposed to do.
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:48.400]  You're not supposed to push back.
[02:04:48.400 --> 02:04:52.400]  You're supposed to take the moral high ground, do kind of not obey,
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:56.400]  but, you know, not provoke them, not try to start a fight because you knew,
[02:04:56.400 --> 02:04:58.400]  you knew that's exactly what they wanted.
[02:04:58.400 --> 02:04:59.400]  They were trying to provoke a response.
[02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:03.400]  And I got to be honest, though, when I saw that they were still pushing kids,
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:08.400]  I blew up by the grace of God, the head guy put his finger to his ear and backed off
[02:05:08.400 --> 02:05:13.400]  because at a certain point they pushed us 200 yards and it really hurt some people.
[02:05:13.400 --> 02:05:16.400]  And I just finally couldn't take it anymore, so...
[02:05:16.400 --> 02:05:18.400]  But anyways, go ahead.
[02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:24.400]  Yeah, and it was actually very symbolic of what was going on all over the country that day.
[02:05:24.400 --> 02:05:29.400]  We had a rally here in Atlanta protesting the private Federal Reserve
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:33.400]  and what I'm seeing, Alex, and I've been doing this for three years
[02:05:33.400 --> 02:05:35.400]  and very much thanks to you.
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:40.400]  I've been awake for five years and started my own website, my own radio show
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:45.400]  because of your inspiration and what happened was I used to go to these rallies
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:49.400]  and end the Fed rallies and it'd be five, ten people tops.
[02:05:49.400 --> 02:05:52.400]  This last week, it was probably 50, 60 people.
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:57.400]  We had a whole eclectic group of people that was, you know, those people from, you know,
[02:05:57.400 --> 02:06:01.400]  anonymous people from Occupy Wall Street, mainline key party people.
[02:06:01.400 --> 02:06:05.400]  That's what scares the power structure is us coming together.
[02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:08.400]  Absolutely, and then you have people of volunteers like myself
[02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:12.400]  that are trying to spread the message of liberty and free markets
[02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:16.400]  and kick this octopus out of the system.
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:21.400]  And it's just a really, really fun and exciting time for people like myself.
[02:06:21.400 --> 02:06:24.400]  I do want to tell people that it's not all doom and gloom.
[02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:27.400]  Oh, no, no, and sometimes I hear my show in rebroadcast
[02:06:27.400 --> 02:06:29.400]  and it sounds like doom and gloom.
[02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:32.400]  I'm just warning people about how bad it is to get them up off their butts,
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:35.400]  but no, we're having all sorts of awakening.
[02:06:35.400 --> 02:06:38.400]  I mean, we beat an escalation of the Syrian War.
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:40.400]  That was the real media that did that.
[02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:42.400]  So it's done, it's very, very exciting.
[02:06:42.400 --> 02:06:44.400]  God bless you, sir. Great points. Anything else?
[02:06:44.400 --> 02:06:48.400]  Yeah, I just wanted to talk about a couple of things before I get off.
[02:06:48.400 --> 02:06:53.400]  Everybody on December 23rd, and Alex, you know the significance of that day.
[02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:57.400]  I am sponsoring a day called Alternative Currency Day.
[02:06:57.400 --> 02:07:00.400]  That's a great idea. We've got to have it in the Fed on December 23rd,
[02:07:00.400 --> 02:07:03.400]  even though most of us are going to be taken off with families
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:05.400]  to at least go to a federal building and protest.
[02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:07.400]  Well, that's not right because the federal reserve isn't federal.
[02:07:07.400 --> 02:07:10.400]  A federal reserve building to protest because it's an imposter.
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:15.400]  It's not federal. That's the 100th anniversary of this cancer.
[02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:18.400]  Yep, and then you can find it on Facebook.
[02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:20.400]  It's under Alternative Currency Day,
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:24.400]  and I run a podcast twice a week, and people listen.
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:27.400]  It doesn't matter how many people start at the beginning.
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:30.400]  When you start out, you're probably going to have five, six listeners.
[02:07:30.400 --> 02:07:32.400]  I started out with five or six people,
[02:07:32.400 --> 02:07:36.400]  and now I've got over a thousand people to listen to my show on the regular
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:38.400]  and go to my website on the regular.
[02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:41.400]  And I just like the brand, so I'm going to go ahead and say it.
[02:07:41.400 --> 02:07:46.400]  We are not cattle.net is the website, and my radio show is we are not cattle.
[02:07:46.400 --> 02:07:49.400]  No, that's you know, we are not sheep, and we are not there.
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:52.400]  No, that's awesome. We're here for other folks to promote what they're doing.
[02:07:52.400 --> 02:07:55.400]  God bless you. I appreciate your call.
[02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:59.400]  And it's weird. I have promoted so many other talk show hosts.
[02:07:59.400 --> 02:08:04.400]  I have promoted so many other news websites and personalities,
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:07.400]  and about 80% of them, the vast majority, as I was thinking about it today,
[02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:12.400]  is about eight out of 10, like want to bring you down because they think
[02:08:12.400 --> 02:08:16.400]  that somehow if you helped them, that if they got rid of you or discredited you,
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:19.400]  they would be the new leader. They don't get a rising tide, raises all ships.
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:23.400]  The only people that really haven't betrayed me is people like George Norrie
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:26.400]  and the whole Coast to Coast group, Matt Drudge, people like that.
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:28.400]  World Net Daily has been helpful.
[02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:32.400]  But I mean, so many others over the years, they just make crap up and everything.
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:35.400]  I'm just working all the time. I'm just a regular, nice friendly guy,
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:39.400]  and society is so evil and so screwed up. I'm just a loyal person.
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:43.400]  I'm so loyal. And I don't think of myself as a good guy.
[02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:49.400]  I just don't get this loyalty and sneakiness and crap acidness.
[02:08:49.400 --> 02:08:51.400]  I mean, I don't know what you call it.
[02:08:51.400 --> 02:08:56.400]  That's what gets to me is just the dishonorableness of the system.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:02.400]  I mean, I would never come up to a peaceful crowd of protesters who've been let in
[02:09:02.400 --> 02:09:05.400]  and then not say move back. If I was ordered, I'd say move back.
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:07.400]  I've been at demonstration where they go, move back, move back.
[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:09.400]  They go, I'm in a couple of minutes. If you don't move back,
[02:09:09.400 --> 02:09:11.400]  we're going to get a little rougher. And then you move back.
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:15.400]  No, it was just like, move back. Bam. I mean, it's like,
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:19.400]  what on earth is going on here?
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:24.400]  And we were legally there and the police chief had let us in and the feds did it.
[02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:26.400]  It was illegal.
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:29.400]  And you're like, well, Alex, what do you expect from this criminal government?
[02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:34.400]  I know it's just that it's different to be there and to see it.
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:38.400]  And actually then yelled the Dallas police and they're all like, literally,
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:40.400]  I talked to one senior guy. I don't know who he was.
[02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:42.400]  I couldn't even tell the police chief. I saw his picture later.
[02:09:42.400 --> 02:09:45.400]  Looked like the deputy police chief and he had like literal tears in his eyes.
[02:09:45.400 --> 02:09:48.400]  I wouldn't say anything. He was like, mm-hmm. I know.
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:50.400]  It was like, I know. Yeah.
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:53.400]  This is horrible. He would like, I said, mm-hmm. Yeah.
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:56.400]  And then later we left doing over to him with his camera off.
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:09:59.400]  They got what it's horrible. It's the, it's, they're under the feds.
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:04.400]  It's a special federal unit of the, of the sheriff and the Dallas police were just
[02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:08.400]  literally freaking out because they draw a peaceful group
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:11.400]  attacked under federal command illegally for no reason.
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:14.400]  You should be freaked out by that. You should be.
[02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:18.400]  That's, that's Mexico. That's Russia. That's China.
[02:10:18.400 --> 02:10:24.400]  That's North Korea folks. That's, we're like half a step from that now.
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:28.400]  And it's the damn feds. I mean, it just comes down.
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:31.400]  They're not even feds. They're foreign run folks.
[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:34.400]  The states get out of hand. The feds are supposed to get involved.
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:36.400]  Feds get out of hand. The states are supposed to get involved.
[02:10:36.400 --> 02:10:39.400]  Now the feds don't even exist. They're just run by foreign banks.
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:43.400]  I mean, we're just totally run by criminals. I mean, I saw a video this week.
[02:10:43.400 --> 02:10:46.400]  I never got to it. Maybe search engine it while I'm talking to the next caller.
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:51.400]  Put it up whenever you want. I'm going to talk to Mark and others right now.
[02:10:51.400 --> 02:10:57.400]  But in Portugal and Spain, they're taking all the police pensions,
[02:10:57.400 --> 02:11:00.400]  which by the way, is not the reason the country is going bankrupt,
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:02.400]  even though they might be a little exorbitant.
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:08.400]  If you look at it, it's derivatives. They've signed it up where they've stolen the money, most of it.
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:13.400]  So the main police union is out there protesting and the, and the riot police,
[02:11:13.400 --> 02:11:19.400]  which in Portugal are hired mercenaries are literally hitting them with rubber bullets and beating them.
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:23.400]  And there's, I mean, then the cops put up with it. There's like that authority thing where,
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:26.400]  okay, well, I'm off duty and I'm having my pension fund taken,
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:33.400]  but now the young cops are going to beat me. I mean, it just, people are all going to take so much of this stuff.
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:37.400]  But in Portugal and Spain, they've taken the guns. They're going to try this crap here.
[02:11:37.400 --> 02:11:41.400]  And I mean, I feel sorry for all the people that are going to pull the triggers on us,
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:45.400]  because triggers are going to undoubtedly get pulled on the other side.
[02:11:45.400 --> 02:11:49.400]  And the globalists won't care. They're flying around in private jets offshore.
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:51.400]  We're all idiots for letting this happen.
[02:11:51.400 --> 02:11:56.400]  And I'm trying to figure out like a Rubik's cube, how do we get out of this?
[02:11:56.400 --> 02:12:00.400]  I just want prosperity. I want my freedom back. I want to legalize freedom.
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:04.400]  I want America back. Not that it's ever been perfect, but man, we're going downhill here.
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:06.400]  That's where I stand.
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:10.400]  Most people like, have all these ulterior motives and won't say what they think.
[02:12:10.400 --> 02:12:15.400]  They're all sneaky because the average person is so insecure, folks.
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:21.400]  When you get back to just, this is how it is. This is where I stand. This is what I'm doing.
[02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:24.400]  All right, let's go to your calls. Mark and then John and everybody else has been holding.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:27.400]  Mark in Kentucky, you're on the air. Welcome.
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:28.400]  Hello.
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:29.400]  Hey, buddy.
[02:12:29.400 --> 02:12:30.400]  How are you doing?
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:32.400]  Pretty good, brother. What's on your phone? Thank you for calling.
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:39.400]  I'm a first time caller. I've been listening for a couple of years and I have a subscription for about a year now.
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:46.400]  But I believe that they were trying to provoke you to take action on Friday.
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:53.400]  And I almost spent money on the fact that they had, you know, 100 more guys than Wade.
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:58.400]  No, no, no. The caller has actually mentioned that I now vaguely remember more of them waiting across the street.
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:07.400]  So, yeah, I think that was the plan was to have us fight back and then they would sandwich us in Kettiless.
[02:13:07.400 --> 02:13:11.400]  But don't they get, I mean, I'm actually afraid that they would have beat my head in or something.
[02:13:11.400 --> 02:13:19.400]  I will pretty much guarantee you there have been, not by me, there would have been reprisals undoubtedly.
[02:13:19.400 --> 02:13:22.400]  What do you think about that?
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:30.400]  Oh, I believe they would have probably opened fire and started.
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:34.400]  Well, we know it was the feds that came out of the federal building under federal command.
[02:13:34.400 --> 02:13:37.400]  What do you think the feds were thinking?
[02:13:37.400 --> 02:13:49.400]  That this might be an opportunity to provoke you into doing something so that could shut down your radio station or bring anything up against you.
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:54.400]  No, I hear you. Listen, turn down your radio and you can focus and talk. You're making good points, but everybody turn down your radio.
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:56.400]  Anything else you'd like to add, sir?
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:14:02.400]  Well, my aunt passed away a month ago from cancer.
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:03.400]  Sorry to hear that.
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:09.400]  And I was wondering if you've ever heard of this thing called DCA.
[02:14:09.400 --> 02:14:11.400]  Is that one of those protein inhibitors?
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:17.400]  I don't know. It's called dichloroacetate. It's supposed to be like a simple molecule.
[02:14:17.400 --> 02:14:22.400]  I've heard about a lot of stuff that's treatments, but I don't know enough about it. It's so complex.
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:25.400]  I've learned stuff now all the time and I'm not young anymore.
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:29.400]  Like all my old knowledge is still there, but new stuff. I still have a good memory, but it's not like it used to be.
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:34.400]  I've forgotten more about most stuff that most people will ever know. Not bragging.
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:39.400]  Yes, it rings the bell, but I can't speak to it.
[02:14:39.400 --> 02:14:47.400]  Well, I have another friend that's just diagnosed with cancer.
[02:14:47.400 --> 02:14:48.400]  Oh, yeah.
[02:14:48.400 --> 02:14:53.400]  And you try to tell these people what they're doing to them and stuff.
[02:14:53.400 --> 02:14:59.400]  And it's like pulling teacher, you know, surgery to get these people listening to what you want to tell them about.
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:01.400]  I know it's very sad. I appreciate you calling in.
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:04.400]  This is all I can say. And you can look these numbers up.
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:07.400]  They try to suppress these numbers, but they're available.
[02:15:07.400 --> 02:15:11.400]  Cancer in the West is up around 3,000% on average.
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:14.400]  Some cancers are up way above that. Some are lower.
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:22.400]  I mean, I saw an ABC News headline six, seven years ago that there would have been a seven-fold increase in lung cancer in the last decade.
[02:15:22.400 --> 02:15:25.400]  And women, even though smoking went down, I mean, they're killing us.
[02:15:25.400 --> 02:15:32.400]  And there's a lot of toxic stuff in the environment, but it's the GMO food that gives rats cancer on record.
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:35.400]  It's the vaccines. It's the water. They're killing us.
[02:15:35.400 --> 02:15:39.400]  Look how sick everybody looks, even if you exercise all day, look how unhealthy.
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:51.400]  And if I was a selfish person, I would sell everything and move with my wife and children to the South Pacific, to a small island.
[02:15:51.400 --> 02:15:58.400]  Five years ago, not last week.
[02:15:58.400 --> 02:16:07.400]  It's a scientific takeover. And that's what's so frustrating about those police and all the thugs and everything else is that it's like getting stabbed.
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:10.400]  If you don't know you got stabbed, you bleed to death, you know, 10 years later.
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:18.400]  That's what soft kill is. And I always use the Pentagon term, killing you softly, soft kill, delayed weapons systems.
[02:16:18.400 --> 02:16:24.400]  And then they have movies like Brad Pitt killing you softly and people say, oh, you heard that in a movie, but we've been killed softly.
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:28.400]  Most of us were going to die young already. They've killed us.
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:32.400]  A lot of people don't care. They go watch a football game and have a good time. They don't care they got killed.
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:35.400]  They don't care their kids are killed. They don't care their first minute was killed.
[02:16:35.400 --> 02:16:40.400]  Their fourth amendment was killed. Their 10th amendment, their economy was killed.
[02:16:40.400 --> 02:16:46.400]  Psychopathic science technocrats are in control.
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:52.400]  And they're putting in a total grid. They call a battle net with all the surveillance systems to bring us down.
[02:16:52.400 --> 02:16:59.400]  And I'm just here. I guess a bad guy warning you about it. I mean that I'm a bad person because I'm aware of it.
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:05.400]  And I'm informed and I'm trying to help people and help myself and and that's bad.
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:12.400]  So it's what it comes down to. I'm a bad person. Let's talk to Clifford in Louisiana. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:17:12.400 --> 02:17:17.400]  Hey, Alex. Can you hear me? Yes, sir. All right. Excuse me if I skip the pleasantries.
[02:17:17.400 --> 02:17:25.400]  But I work in close conjunction with with some of the military here locally.
[02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:38.400]  And every day I see them do training to where they can go in and take an area and get with the local governing officials and kind of hold the area, you know, like they do in Iraq or Afghanistan.
[02:17:38.400 --> 02:17:43.400]  Yeah, they're practicing to hold U.S. cities during collapse. Yeah. Which the system is engineered. Yeah.
[02:17:43.400 --> 02:17:50.400]  Yeah. And I see this on the regular. And I think myself, well, you know, you're coming shortly. This is going to happen on U.S. soil.
[02:17:50.400 --> 02:17:59.400]  And I asked some of the soldiers, hey, do you do you make the comparison? Do you see how this could go on here in America?
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:10.400]  And it like goes right over the top of their head. They don't they don't even they don't even get it. Like you said, they're too busy worried about football as a new iPhone coming out.
[02:18:10.400 --> 02:18:15.400]  Oh, Xbox is coming out with a new system. And, you know,
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:22.400]  Yeah, well, they're going to here's the deal. If it was a real collapse, they were stabilizing things. They'd be welcome with open arms.
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:32.400]  This is an engineered clout and pebbin collapse on record, rank corporation plan. And they're bringing it in and they're going to try to arrest all the patriots, take our guns.
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:34.400]  Now, does that sound like a very safe job?
[02:18:34.400 --> 02:18:46.400]  No, well, this is this is what I try to explain to people because I tell them, hey, look, if you knew the master plan, you knew everything that was going to go on, it would make the top of your head explode.
[02:18:46.400 --> 02:18:49.400]  You would just the FEMA camps.
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:59.400]  No, you would act like I do. You would be freaking out and frustrated and angry because it's pretty much all public. That's what's crazy is that this is all there.
[02:18:59.400 --> 02:19:13.400]  The same people aren't even stupid. They know everything about football. If the football heads knew about COG, continuity of government, police state like, like I do, like they know about football, it became over for the New World Order.
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:21.400]  But they don't think that's interesting to know about a creeping evil takeover. They just want to literally go to the bar and act tough and wear sports jerseys.
[02:19:21.400 --> 02:19:41.400]  I had somebody ask me, well, what really is bad about having the FEMA camps just in case something happened? I told them, do you not realize that once you enter one of those camps to go in and get your free clothes and free food and free house and your little job that they're going to give you, you know, you're going to sign away all of your rights.
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:53.400]  Wow, it sounds like you know what you're talking about. Are you a social worker or police officer? Excuse me? Are you a social worker, police officer? I'm former military. I was OIF one.
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:59.400]  So are you a contractor? Why are you working with them now in COG? I'm a contractor.
[02:19:59.400 --> 02:20:12.400]  Well, let's expand on that. For those that don't know, the Emergency Centers Establishment Act that they tried to pass three years ago last year and this year, all it does is legalize and increase funding for what's already there. You read that hundred plus page bill.
[02:20:12.400 --> 02:20:23.400]  That's the plan. And they say in the new army manuals that they reeducate you, the troublemakers are going to have to be taken away to a special camp.
[02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:32.400]  And everybody else, you're right. They're going to have movies and rock bands that come in and it's like, oh, things collapsed, but we got to work camp and folks are helping.
[02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:47.400]  There was some trouble at the camp and it's all a bunch of politically correct social workers over police and military. Can you imagine being under the social workers and the socialists at the damn camps?
[02:20:47.400 --> 02:20:55.400]  I mean, look, we're not going, folks. So to the cops and military to think people are going to go, if one percent stand up, you're all dead.
[02:20:55.400 --> 02:21:05.400]  And that's the plan. They're going to wipe out the police and military in the Civil War and then bring in the fire and I for formation. And that's all that's public record to rank corporation.
[02:21:05.400 --> 02:21:14.400]  Things were so dumb. It's all published the entire battle plan. That's how pathetic they think we are because no one in Congress will dare challenge it.
[02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:28.400]  No one will dare because it's so horrible. Even though I know Rand Paul and Ted Cruz know about all this, I know they do. They won't even broach that because the public can't even believe Obamacare is meant to double their prices and kick people off.
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:36.400]  Even though when it came true, they attacked Ted Cruz. See, the public can't even admit they're being raped when it's happening in front of them. Go ahead.
[02:21:36.400 --> 02:21:44.400]  They're doing all of this out in public. They're doing it on the Internet. They're showing everything that they're doing, everything that was associated with JFK.
[02:21:44.400 --> 02:21:52.400]  If you can look at that and honestly believe that one lone man decided to take the top of the president of the United States head off, you're crazy.
[02:21:52.400 --> 02:21:57.400]  You're ludicrous for even believing that one guy could just do that by himself.
[02:21:57.400 --> 02:22:07.400]  There's so many different discrepancies in the story that it's ridiculous just to believe that Oswald decided to stick his gun out the window and shoot the president on his own.
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:18.400]  All the other influences and it just baffles me that people will not just pay attention. They won't look. They won't do their own research.
[02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:27.400]  Well, America's drunk on entertainment and everything else. I hear you God bless you. I got to cram in the rest real fast. But as birthday parties in like 10 minutes, I'm already going to be a half hour late.
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:30.400]  Let's go to John and Texas. Thanks for holding brother. Go ahead.
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:39.400]  Hi Alex. Thank you for taking my call. I'll keep it as brief as I can. I've been a long time listener and supporter of the Info War.
[02:22:39.400 --> 02:22:44.400]  I still have my very first VHS copy of America destroyed by design.
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:45.400]  Thank you for the support brother.
[02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:56.400]  Oh, you're welcome. And I continue to do that my own way. I print out flyers and put them up to coffee shops. I've made short five minute videos and give them out to friends and family.
[02:22:56.400 --> 02:22:57.400]  Good job.
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:05.400]  But the main reason I'm calling is something you said last week that really put the fire under my butt.
[02:23:05.400 --> 02:23:18.400]  I have been a Blue Lodge Freemason now for about five years. And I only did that because of the founding fathers of Texas and the founding fathers of America.
[02:23:18.400 --> 02:23:21.400]  They were all Freemasons. They're all Blue Lodge Masons.
[02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:26.400]  No, they were. I mean, I mean, people that say Masons are all evil and all that. They don't know what they're talking about.
[02:23:26.400 --> 02:23:35.400]  My issue is, as I should know the history of it and everything, my point is, is as George Washington wrote, it was being taken over in his day.
[02:23:35.400 --> 02:23:40.400]  So if Masons don't stand up against this, what does that say about Masons?
[02:23:40.400 --> 02:23:46.400]  Exactly. And that's the barrel that I have taken. I was born and raised in Texas.
[02:23:46.400 --> 02:23:52.400]  You know, we'd go to the Alamo and have a moment of silence as a family. That's holy ground to Texas.
[02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:59.400]  Those men that died there died for the belief that everybody should be free. Everybody. Doesn't matter.
[02:23:59.400 --> 02:24:01.400]  And most of them were Masons.
[02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:06.400]  Most of them were Masons and that's what makes me proud to be part of that.
[02:24:06.400 --> 02:24:12.400]  But you really lit the fire under me last week and I've been trying to call in and just say that, you know what?
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:21.400]  There is at least one of us out there in Texas with that spirit of liberty that is doing the best I can and fighting the fights that I can.
[02:24:21.400 --> 02:24:24.400]  Sure. Well, you know what the Bible says and I want you to be able to continue.
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:28.400]  The Bible says you judge a tree by its fruits and there's a lot of different arms of the Masons.
[02:24:28.400 --> 02:24:34.400]  It just goes back even pre-Christianity, back to Egypt and of course Solomon's Temple, as you know.
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:42.400]  I had a lot of family that were Masons and I had great grandpas that were Masons and stuff and grandpas that, you know, had family that were Masons.
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:48.400]  And they just said, don't be part of it now. It's become corrupt and that's like anything. It becomes corrupt.
[02:24:48.400 --> 02:24:52.400]  I'm not saying every lodge is corrupt or they're devil worshipers or whatever.
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:58.400]  My point is, I mean, I know what's really going on in those lodges. I've researched it. None of it's really secret.
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:02.400]  People are lazy and just don't read the official Masonry books. I've read them.
[02:25:02.400 --> 02:25:08.400]  And look, George Washington was actually doing what it really said and was actually promoting liberty.
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:13.400]  Now, I don't see the Masons doing that. I see them attacking me behind the scenes.
[02:25:13.400 --> 02:25:17.400]  I see them promoting the establishment. I see them pushing the system.
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:20.400]  You know, just get up here and say, oh, the Masons are all evil. You do that.
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:24.400]  It then makes Masons who aren't evil think that you're lying about them.
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:32.400]  My issue is the globalists, the Illuminati that George Washington talked about, have used the Blue Lodge and others.
[02:25:32.400 --> 02:25:40.400]  They've tried to infiltrate. I mean, it's on record the Illuminati tried to infiltrate the Masons and did in France and Germany and took it over.
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:48.400]  And George Washington said, I don't want to be part of that Masonic movement. You know, this is evil. This is Illuminati.
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:52.400]  This is devil worship. People don't even know George Washington's letters exist.
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:57.400]  They think we're just making this up. It's in the National Archives, but go ahead and make your point.
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:05.400]  Oh, no, I totally agree that the Masonry in large in the world had unfortunately been infiltrated.
[02:26:05.400 --> 02:26:10.400]  Especially in the United States, and I'm going to tell you something real blunt.
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:23.400]  I believe from my years as Mason and of my own research, I believe that the American arm of the Illuminati in America,
[02:26:23.400 --> 02:26:30.400]  as far as the part that infiltrated Masonry, are the Scottish right of the southern part of the United States.
[02:26:30.400 --> 02:26:38.400]  If you read and you look between the lines, they have pushed this agenda, their agenda,
[02:26:38.400 --> 02:26:44.400]  not the honorable good brotherhood playing that Masonry promotes in general.
[02:26:44.400 --> 02:26:48.400]  They have pushed their personal agenda into every single Lodge and they do try.
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:53.400]  They try their best to do it, infiltrate and push what they believe.
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:57.400]  I'm not a Scottish right. I never will be as long as I live.
[02:26:57.400 --> 02:27:03.400]  But I'll tell you, from my own research, that's the heart.
[02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:06.400]  Well, look, I mean, you're going to have clicks everywhere.
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:14.400]  Let's try to explain people. You can take any organization, any race, any religion, any group, and bad people can take it over.
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:22.400]  What matters is the heart. And so I'm challenging Masons, just like I've done on national television, on that History Channel piece.
[02:27:22.400 --> 02:27:26.400]  I mean, I know George Washington. I've researched him. He was a great man. He was a Mason.
[02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:28.400]  Andrew Jackson, great man, a Mason.
[02:27:28.400 --> 02:27:37.400]  But the point is, is that, is that, is that there is a battle within Masonry and the devil always tries to create a counterfeit.
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:44.400]  That's what I'm saying. And if you go back to what you call them, the official founder of the Mason, Solomon,
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:52.400]  there's a debate whether he was a good guy or a bad guy, because with great knowledge becomes, you know, great goodness and badness.
[02:27:52.400 --> 02:28:01.400]  So it's very sophisticated. I've studied it. I'm not a Mason, but, but I know that I had, you know, great grandfathers and other people and family,
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:10.400]  the founders of Texas that were Masons who were incredibly honorable, good people who would not be involved in any corruption and really believed in some good ideas.
[02:28:10.400 --> 02:28:19.400]  And there's no doubt, though, that I don't see the modern Masons fighting tyranny. I see them promoting the establishment agenda and they need to face that.
[02:28:19.400 --> 02:28:28.400]  I'm not saying they're bad up front. I'm being honorable and absolutely on the level about all this stuff.
[02:28:28.400 --> 02:28:35.400]  I'm saying, okay, I'm not saying you're bad. Show me your fruits. What are you going to do as America's darkest hour?
[02:28:35.400 --> 02:28:41.400]  What are you doing right now? If you acted like George Washington, I would support you. You're not acting like George Washington.
[02:28:41.400 --> 02:28:47.400]  You're acting like the opposite of George Washington. I don't care how much money you gave to some tax-exempt hospital that steals the money.
[02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:53.400]  I don't care what you did to build, you know, some new, you know, veterans hall or whatever. Great.
[02:28:53.400 --> 02:29:00.400]  I want to see you on the street battling for the Bill of Rights and Constitution that your forebearers created.
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:04.400]  I want to see you defend that. I appreciate your call, sir. We got to move quick now.
[02:29:04.400 --> 02:29:11.400]  The crew's got to get home. They've been working so hard. Nico and John Bown and Wes and the whole crew working seven days a week lately.
[02:29:11.400 --> 02:29:16.400]  We're about to hire some more folks to help them out. That's why we got to promote the products and get some money in here.
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:20.400]  Edward in New York, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:22.400]  All right. Hello. Hello, Mr. Alec Schoen.
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:24.400]  Hey, brother. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[02:29:24.400 --> 02:29:29.400]  All right. I want to let you know that you want to know what's going to happen, how we're going to stop this.
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:39.400]  Well, right here in Long Island in Suffolk County, we're having a massive eminent domain seizure of property coming up for what's called the Ron Concoma Hub project.
[02:29:39.400 --> 02:29:47.400]  It's endorsed by Schumer and Cuomo, all those big heads, and there's another one called Wyandanch Rising.
[02:29:47.400 --> 02:29:55.400]  And what it is, it's supposed to be a massive transportation hub that they're going to start building in our small suburban communities here,
[02:29:55.400 --> 02:29:59.400]  and they're going to create high-density housing and all this other stuff.
[02:29:59.400 --> 02:30:04.400]  They give you an idea. We have two ways. We're going to try and resist this.
[02:30:04.400 --> 02:30:09.400]  There's a final vote coming up in January 9th at the Brookhaven Town Hall.
[02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:14.400]  And this let me give you a couple of quotes of what the tyrants have said here.
[02:30:14.400 --> 02:30:19.400]  Schumer, you got my attention. Brookhaven, a nice slip.
[02:30:19.400 --> 02:30:23.400]  He hailed it as a regional project which would rehabilitate the train stations.
[02:30:23.400 --> 02:30:28.400]  Sure. Sure. What they do is they take public works now and give it to their insider buddies.
[02:30:28.400 --> 02:30:32.400]  It's classic scams. And then while they shut off all their competition,
[02:30:32.400 --> 02:30:35.400]  whereas if they had a free market and had public works, that would be different.
[02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:41.400]  But they're busy restrangling the economy while they only give themselves the blood supply.
[02:30:41.400 --> 02:30:45.400]  The company that is called TriTech, I'm looking at their website too,
[02:30:45.400 --> 02:30:48.400]  and they're saying it's to help our community and meet our needs.
[02:30:48.400 --> 02:30:50.400]  We don't need our needs met, our needs are fine.
[02:30:50.400 --> 02:30:57.400]  We're a tax, we're a number of Forbes magazine has it listed as number 11 in the most tax county in the United States.
[02:30:57.400 --> 02:31:02.400]  We don't need any, we don't need to be subsidizing more people coming into our schools
[02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:06.400]  other than sewage treatment plants. And then there's going to be more eminent domain seizures.
[02:31:06.400 --> 02:31:09.400]  They're not even menstrual. They're going to have to build parking lots.
[02:31:09.400 --> 02:31:12.400]  Schumer is also endorsing the double track project,
[02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:16.400]  which is going to build an extra rail line through Suffolk County.
[02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:20.400]  They're going to have to see a lot of property coming right towards where I live.
[02:31:20.400 --> 02:31:28.400]  Oh, I know, they just absolutely take the taxpayer money and then give it to public works projects that are privately run,
[02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:30.400]  basically by the mafia.
[02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:36.400]  Yeah, there's a quote, the book called Intellectual Society by the author Thomas Sowell.
[02:31:36.400 --> 02:31:41.400]  And he mentions it, I think he says, actually I got it right here,
[02:31:41.400 --> 02:31:49.400]  even more direct benefit to the fluent and the wealthy at the expense of the people of low and moderate incomes
[02:31:49.400 --> 02:31:53.400]  is resulted from the ever greater scope of allowed government officials to override property rights
[02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:58.400]  in the name of open space and smart growth, other forms of arbitrary building restrictions.
[02:31:58.400 --> 02:32:04.400]  But anyway, so we were having a large civic meeting in our town here of Ron Concoma.
[02:32:04.400 --> 02:32:13.400]  And we had the whole high school junior high was filled, a whole auditorium, over 300 people, not a single resident there was in favor of this project.
[02:32:13.400 --> 02:32:18.400]  No, I know that's what smart growth is, is they selectively decide who can build and who can't.
[02:32:18.400 --> 02:32:22.400]  It's mafia put into the building code. God bless you, Edward, good points.
[02:32:22.400 --> 02:32:27.400]  Last caller, appreciate you holding D in California, you're on the air.
[02:32:27.400 --> 02:32:28.400]  Hi, Alex.
[02:32:28.400 --> 02:32:29.400]  Hi.
[02:32:29.400 --> 02:32:34.400]  I want to know if you've heard about the fMRI machine.
[02:32:34.400 --> 02:32:35.400]  Say that again.
[02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:37.400]  The fMRI machine.
[02:32:37.400 --> 02:32:42.400]  I know they've got a lot of different types of new magnetic resonance machines. Yes.
[02:32:42.400 --> 02:32:47.400]  Yeah, well, they're not telling you the full story about that.
[02:32:47.400 --> 02:32:53.400]  That and the brain mapping, the hospitals have been hypnotizing people with that.
[02:32:53.400 --> 02:33:00.400]  I mean, quickly, they don't even know what happened. And then they're asking them all kinds of questions about guns and.
[02:33:00.400 --> 02:33:03.400]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, man on record under Obamacare.
[02:33:03.400 --> 02:33:09.400]  When they get you drugged up or in a test, they have a computer hooked to the health department and they say, you got enough money right now.
[02:33:09.400 --> 02:33:11.400]  And he said, no, we don't have money.
[02:33:11.400 --> 02:33:13.400]  They take your kids or they test your blood.
[02:33:13.400 --> 02:33:15.400]  You smoke marijuana, they take your kids.
[02:33:15.400 --> 02:33:19.400]  The hospitals are there praying on you in a predatory way. Yes.
[02:33:19.400 --> 02:33:24.400]  Well, I'm saying that, but they were also under one that people are under hypnosis.
[02:33:24.400 --> 02:33:27.400]  They're trying to get them to turn against their family members.
[02:33:27.400 --> 02:33:29.400]  Well, they do all sorts of mind control in the hospitals.
[02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:31.400]  They've always used those.
[02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:35.400]  Not all hospitals are involved in it, but yeah, no, they've always used hospitals as front.
[02:33:35.400 --> 02:33:36.400]  So this is a criminal government.
[02:33:36.400 --> 02:33:43.400]  So their thing is to use government and corporations that control government as a system to commit crime against the population.
[02:33:43.400 --> 02:33:45.400]  So send me some information. God bless you.
[02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:46.400]  I appreciate your call.
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:49.400]  Look, I'm out of time. I appreciate the crew.
[02:33:49.400 --> 02:33:52.400]  And I know we got a lot of other folks on hold, but I'm just out of time.
[02:33:52.400 --> 02:33:59.400]  We'll be back. Lord willing, 11 a.m. Central tomorrow with the mainline weekday radio transmission.
[02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:09.400]  We've got a big interview tomorrow as well with Vivian Kubrick, of course, daughter of the legendary top director in history, Stanley Kubrick.
[02:34:09.400 --> 02:34:17.400]  We're going to have that premiering here on the worldwide transmission and so much more.
[02:34:17.400 --> 02:34:19.400]  So you want to stay with us for that.
[02:34:19.400 --> 02:34:23.400]  She did a lot of the scores, worked on the movies, really smart lady, got a chance to meet her.
[02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:24.400]  Great job with the crew.
[02:34:24.400 --> 02:34:30.400]  And again, pray for liberty, pray for freedom and talking right to the Masons with all your on the level compass stuff.
[02:34:30.400 --> 02:34:31.400]  Come on.
[02:34:31.400 --> 02:34:42.400]  I mean, if you're really on the level, be on the level and just be open and honest that you're helping a new world order.
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:35:04.400]  It's a tree by its fridge.
