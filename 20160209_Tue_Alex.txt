[00:00.000 --> 00:12.320]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.320 --> 00:21.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.120 --> 00:29.960]  we are live on this Tuesday February 9 this is the Alex Jones show I'll be
[00:29.960 --> 00:34.440]  filling in for Alex I'm Paul Joseph Watson in the third hour we've got an
[00:34.440 --> 00:40.320]  exclusive interview with anti-Islamist activist and author Tommy Robinson he's
[00:40.320 --> 00:45.800]  been on the show before he of course took part in the Pegida UK demonstrations
[00:45.800 --> 00:50.720]  on Saturday which happened in several different UK cities as well as others
[00:50.720 --> 00:54.760]  across Europe so that's going to be a really interesting discussion going to
[00:54.760 --> 01:00.120]  try and take your calls during that interview and if possible in the second
[01:00.120 --> 01:04.760]  hour Alex Jones might be popping in in the second hour but we'll try and get to
[01:04.760 --> 01:10.840]  your calls at some point but Fox News has kind of jumped the gun on the New
[01:10.840 --> 01:16.720]  Hampshire primaries by publishing the results in advance this broke a couple of
[01:16.720 --> 01:21.840]  hours ago on info wars.com Fox News is reporting the final results of tonight's
[01:21.840 --> 01:26.480]  Republican and Democratic primaries in advance with a mock-up page showing
[01:26.480 --> 01:32.880]  establishment favorite Marco Rubio finishing in second place now what
[01:32.880 --> 01:37.240]  obviously happened here was they had some kind of beta test for their website
[01:37.240 --> 01:41.800]  script which would count the votes as they were coming in during tonight's
[01:41.800 --> 01:47.160]  primary but somebody at Fox News obviously released that page and
[01:47.160 --> 01:52.240]  published it live to the internet a little too early now as you will know in
[01:52.240 --> 01:56.320]  the article I'm not saying that this is some dark shadowy conspiracy on behalf
[01:56.320 --> 02:01.920]  of Fox News but it's interesting nonetheless because about 30 minutes
[02:01.920 --> 02:06.680]  after this article was published on info wars.com which shows the full
[02:06.680 --> 02:10.360]  results of the New Hampshire primary despite the fact that basically no
[02:10.360 --> 02:16.800]  votes have taken place yet Fox News then reset all the totals back to zero
[02:16.800 --> 02:22.400]  percent so they had Trump as the winner on 28 percent they had Rubio in second
[02:22.400 --> 02:27.800]  on 15 percent Cruz in third on 12 percent and again this was live on the
[02:27.800 --> 02:34.000]  Fox News.com website and it has been since at least yesterday people started
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.880]  to pick up on it today they also had the result of the Democratic primary they
[02:38.880 --> 02:44.200]  had Bernie Sanders 10 percent in front of Hillary Clinton of course if you look
[02:44.200 --> 02:48.800]  at the polls he's set to beat her by an average of 14 percent if you look at the
[02:48.800 --> 02:54.760]  cross polling figures so basically this was laid out in public by Fox News on
[02:54.760 --> 02:59.200]  their own website yes it was not a conspiracy it was obviously a mock-up
[02:59.200 --> 03:04.080]  page they were beta testing how they would count the votes as they roll in
[03:04.080 --> 03:08.360]  but what's interesting of course is that they then pulled it they reset all the
[03:08.360 --> 03:14.360]  totals back to zero percent 30 minutes after this article was published now you
[03:14.360 --> 03:18.800]  have people all over Twitter saying they never published the results of the New
[03:18.800 --> 03:23.000]  Hampshire primary look I'm I'm visiting the page right now it says zero percent
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.920]  well yes it's because they flipped it back what's interesting about this of
[03:27.920 --> 03:33.440]  course if you compare it to a couple of weeks ago we had Microsoft with their
[03:33.440 --> 03:38.720]  app helping to count the votes for the Iowa caucus of course many Trump
[03:38.720 --> 03:44.200]  supporters complained that that aided Marco Rubio who is in bed with Microsoft
[03:44.200 --> 03:49.440]  that it may have helped him cheat in Iowa there was no evidence for that but
[03:49.440 --> 03:56.200]  Microsoft did release their predicted results of Iowa almost a week before the
[03:56.200 --> 03:59.560]  primary itself of course that was a close race between Bernie Sanders and
[03:59.560 --> 04:04.840]  Hillary Clinton Microsoft through their Bing predictive technology released the
[04:04.840 --> 04:10.560]  results and said that Hillary Clinton would be Bernie Sanders so people asked
[04:10.560 --> 04:15.520]  the question was this predictive programming if people think that you
[04:15.520 --> 04:20.080]  know Hillary's a shoe in that she's guaranteed to beat Sanders does that make
[04:20.080 --> 04:24.880]  them less likely to vote for Sanders could we be seeing a similar thing with
[04:24.880 --> 04:29.960]  this Fox News article about them publishing the results of the New
[04:29.960 --> 04:35.440]  Hampshire primary before any votes have been made some very interesting
[04:35.440 --> 04:40.280]  proposition especially if the final tally when it comes out later tonight and
[04:40.280 --> 04:47.040]  tomorrow matches with the tally published by Fox News at least 24 hours in
[04:47.040 --> 04:51.800]  advance we'll get more into it after the race ton of news coming up this is the
[04:51.800 --> 04:55.840]  Alex Jones show I don't go away
[04:58.200 --> 05:03.000]  if polls are to be believed Hillary Clinton's once commanding national lead
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.360]  over Bernie Sanders appears to have evaporated in a matter of days pointing
[05:07.360 --> 05:11.240]  to trouble ahead for the former secretary of state as voters cast their
[05:11.240 --> 05:16.080]  ballots Tuesday in Sanders friendly New Hampshire reports Fox News a recent
[05:16.080 --> 05:21.320]  Reuters poll shows Clinton leading Sanders 48 to 45 while state polls are
[05:21.320 --> 05:25.760]  far better indicators going into each individual primary national polls help
[05:25.760 --> 05:30.120]  gauge the candidates broader appeal over the past several months Clinton has at
[05:30.120 --> 05:34.080]  times led the national polls by more than 30 points contributing to her
[05:34.080 --> 05:39.000]  front-runner label even as she has faced tough races in Iowa and New Hampshire
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.320]  but Sanders may be heading for a big win in New Hampshire Tuesday night if he
[05:43.320 --> 05:46.880]  can hold off Clinton who has gotten tougher on the Vermont senator in
[05:46.880 --> 05:51.560]  recent days as her husband Bill Clinton ratchets up his attacks you can find

[09:09.600 --> 09:14.640]  more than any other institution out there of freedom and I'm so proud of
[09:14.640 --> 09:18.640]  that the notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women no bill
[09:18.640 --> 09:23.600]  rapes them physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically I hope the
[09:23.600 --> 09:27.560]  enemies of this broadcast when you lie about us when you censor us when you

[09:44.200 --> 09:52.800]  in American history from the front lines of the information war it's Alex
[09:52.800 --> 09:59.960]  Jones on the Alex Jones show I'm Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex today
[09:59.960 --> 10:04.600]  and as I was discussing before the break Fox News jumped the gun they announced
[10:04.600 --> 10:09.960]  the results of the New Hampshire primary at least 24 hours in advance with a
[10:09.960 --> 10:14.840]  mock-up web page on their own official website stating that establishment
[10:14.840 --> 10:20.040]  favorite Marco Rubio would come in second now Rubio himself has expressed
[10:20.040 --> 10:24.200]  doubt about whether he will achieve that he says he may even come in fourth and
[10:24.200 --> 10:28.720]  of course all the discussion has been from the pundits that Rubio has to be
[10:28.720 --> 10:34.560]  case it he has to be Chris Christie he has to be Jeb Bush he has to come out on
[10:34.560 --> 10:39.840]  top of the establishment candidates to then become the primary challenger to
[10:39.840 --> 10:45.320]  Trump and Cruz so interesting that Fox would come out with this obviously it's
[10:45.320 --> 10:50.040]  not a dark shadowy conspiracy which I said in the article that's not the case
[10:50.040 --> 10:54.360]  even though some people in the comments why how dare info war suggest that this
[10:54.360 --> 10:58.480]  is some kind of conspiracy it's obviously a beta test well yes it is but
[10:58.480 --> 11:02.200]  it's also interesting that they then removed it immediately after we
[11:02.200 --> 11:06.120]  published this article and it started to get a lot of traction on the web
[11:06.120 --> 11:10.640]  because again Microsoft a couple of weeks ago before Iowa came out with
[11:10.640 --> 11:14.880]  their own prediction based on their Bing technology that Hillary Clinton would
[11:14.880 --> 11:20.360]  be Bernie Sanders and that's exactly what happened is it predictive programming
[11:20.360 --> 11:25.080]  could it sway people to vote a certain way well that's up for debate but what's
[11:25.080 --> 11:28.880]  not up for debate is that they published the full results of the New
[11:28.880 --> 11:35.120]  Hampshire primary 100% of votes in and actually went into detail they went
[11:35.120 --> 11:40.360]  town by town and tallied up all the different votes via that way so this
[11:40.360 --> 11:45.400]  wasn't just a blanket superficial prediction they went into detail with
[11:45.400 --> 11:49.840]  this somebody hit the published button by mistake it's been up on the internet
[11:49.840 --> 11:53.600]  for about 24 hours now they've pulled it but again it's going to be very
[11:53.600 --> 11:59.960]  interesting to see if the final result tallies with what Fox News published
[11:59.960 --> 12:04.920]  yesterday now we're going to get on to some more news soon we've got quite a
[12:04.920 --> 12:09.040]  prominent person in the political sphere for a couple of decades now who is
[12:09.040 --> 12:15.520]  predicting that the GOP will rig New Hampshire to help Marco Rubio we're going
[12:15.520 --> 12:20.120]  to tell you about that in a moment but first here's John Bowne with a special
[12:20.120 --> 12:24.680]  report on impeachment here's the clip
[12:24.920 --> 12:28.840]  regarding executive orders the Constitution states in article two
[12:28.840 --> 12:34.160]  section three clause five that the executive i.e. the president take care
[12:34.160 --> 12:39.520]  that the laws be faithfully executed or face impeachment specifically an
[12:39.520 --> 12:43.840]  executive order must find support in the Constitution watering down the Second
[12:43.840 --> 12:47.480]  Amendment in order to confiscate the lawful right of a majority of Americans
[12:47.480 --> 12:52.760]  to protect themselves can hardly mean the laws are being faithfully executed
[12:52.760 --> 12:57.760]  the conversation has to be based on facts and truth and what we're actually
[12:57.760 --> 13:02.400]  proposing a big miss for Obama as he failed to explain to all of us what is
[13:02.400 --> 13:07.640]  contained in his latest executive order allowing HIPAA to protect doctors that
[13:07.640 --> 13:12.360]  ordered gun confiscation of their patients based on vague conditions is
[13:12.360 --> 13:17.080]  what's really sending alarm bells ringing as if the health care system wasn't
[13:17.080 --> 13:21.640]  screwed up enough unconstitutionally by Obama we heard not only from the gun
[13:21.640 --> 13:27.320]  lobby but from United States senators that expanding background checks will
[13:27.320 --> 13:33.040]  not may will lead to a registry which will lead to confiscation which will
[13:33.040 --> 13:36.720]  lead to a tyrannical government let's not forget the Gabrielle Giffords
[13:36.720 --> 13:42.120]  thankfully survived the 2011 Tucson shooting by the possibly MK ultra
[13:42.120 --> 13:46.360]  victimized Jared Lee Loeffner who erratically declared to the police while
[13:46.360 --> 13:50.200]  victims were still being treated I just want you to know that I'm the only
[13:50.200 --> 13:55.520]  person that knew about this strange unfortunately federal judge John Roll
[13:55.520 --> 14:01.120]  a staunch blockade to Obama's future immigration invasion was murdered along
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.920]  with five others talk about a conspiracy I'm sorry Cooper yes it is fair to call
[14:05.920 --> 14:14.240]  the conspiracy what are you saying are you suggesting that the notion that we
[14:14.240 --> 14:19.560]  are creating a plot to take everybody's guns away so that we can impose
[14:19.560 --> 14:24.520]  martial law while you've been president we are at the lowest murder rate in our
[14:24.520 --> 14:29.240]  country all-time low murders we've been talking about Chicago but downstate
[14:29.240 --> 14:33.880]  Illinois is closer to Kentucky and everybody hunts down there and so this
[14:33.880 --> 14:40.160]  is not alien territory to me I grew up in Kentucky trust me those guns aren't
[14:40.160 --> 14:44.520]  just for hunting and secondly Obama you don't know a damn thing about Kentucky
[14:44.520 --> 14:48.840]  well I've got bad news for all of you that scoff at the word impeachment once
[14:48.840 --> 14:54.000]  Obama leaves office he will have set the table for global government to legally
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.720]  come in and feast on the American public Obama trade with its laws that
[14:58.720 --> 15:02.640]  bypassed the US Congress for the benefit of the banking corporate elite
[15:02.640 --> 15:07.880]  Obamacare a middle-class destroying Stasi-esque data collection system
[15:07.880 --> 15:13.040]  masquerading as a health care system Obama Gration flooding our cities with
[15:13.040 --> 15:19.040]  criminals and jihadists and now Obama fiscation a solitary push to reduce the
[15:19.040 --> 15:23.920]  threat posed by armed Americans as the final dish by the New World Order's
[15:23.920 --> 15:29.080]  puppet is presented to the table by not impeaching Obama our nationalist
[15:29.080 --> 15:35.480]  apathy will legally and necessarily aid and abet the death of the United States
[15:35.480 --> 15:40.680]  of America the time is now call your representative at two zero two two two
[15:40.680 --> 15:46.280]  four three one two one operators are standing by and if your representative
[15:46.280 --> 15:50.080]  needs more information direct them to the North American Law Center dot orgs
[15:50.080 --> 15:54.160]  articles of impeachment of Barack Hussein Obama at the very top of their
[15:54.160 --> 15:58.960]  webpage John bound for infowars.com
[15:58.960 --> 16:07.840]  John bound with a special report now continuing from Fox News publishing the
[16:07.840 --> 16:12.080]  results of the New Hampshire primary in advance we've also got this story up
[16:12.080 --> 16:18.160]  on infowars.com Dilbert creator predicts GOP will rig New Hampshire now of
[16:18.160 --> 16:23.040]  course we have these charges after Iowa with Microsoft with their app counting
[16:23.040 --> 16:28.000]  the vote Trump supporters felt that Rubio had cheated to attain his
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.480]  surprise third place position now we got the creator of the Dilbert cartoon
[16:32.480 --> 16:37.160]  series saying if they don't fix the race or they fix it only a little Trump will
[16:37.160 --> 16:42.360]  win big. Scott Adams the creator of the popular Dilbert cartoon series predicts
[16:42.360 --> 16:45.920]  that the GOP will rig tonight's primary in New Hampshire to favor
[16:45.920 --> 16:50.400]  establishment favorite Marco Rubio. In a blog posting Adams argues there is too
[16:50.400 --> 16:53.880]  much at stake for the fixers not to do anything to counter the juggernaut of
[16:53.880 --> 16:59.480]  Donald Trump's campaign listen to what he said there is no natural reason to
[16:59.480 --> 17:04.080]  expect Rubio the establishment candidate to have another surprise surge as he did
[17:04.080 --> 17:09.360]  in Iowa and of course he points to Rubio's poor performance in Saturday
[17:09.360 --> 17:13.720]  nights debate when he got called out by Chris Christie on basically being a
[17:13.720 --> 17:20.000]  wind-up toy repeating the same phrases over and over again so Dilbert can the
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.440]  creator of Dilbert continues for Rubio to have a surprisingly strong second
[17:24.440 --> 17:28.360]  place showing in New Hampshire look for the most common explanations for that
[17:28.360 --> 17:33.360]  surprise to be his momentum from Iowa I assume that most of you think it's
[17:33.360 --> 17:38.160]  conspiracy talk and not to be taken seriously but he points out that he
[17:38.160 --> 17:43.280]  predicted the rise of Trump back in September when everybody else was saying
[17:43.280 --> 17:47.440]  it wasn't going to happen so that somebody who's been quite prominent in
[17:47.440 --> 17:52.800]  political circles definitely not a conspiracy theorist God forbid predicting
[17:52.800 --> 17:57.480]  that the establishment will rig it tonight again to help Rubio because they
[17:57.480 --> 18:02.200]  predicted that he needs to come out on top of the establishment candidates to
[18:02.200 --> 18:07.240]  challenge Trump and Cruz because it's all going to be about who finishes second
[18:07.240 --> 18:11.000]  and third they're going to completely ignore the fact that Sanders and Trump
[18:11.000 --> 18:17.080]  are going to win they're going to argue in debate about the margin with which
[18:17.080 --> 18:21.280]  they win to try and denigrate those victories because they're terrified of
[18:21.280 --> 18:26.560]  either Sanders or Trump becoming the nominee in both cases so they're going
[18:26.560 --> 18:32.120]  to try and pump up Rubio that's what they did after Iowa kind of backfired after
[18:32.120 --> 18:37.080]  his gaff during Saturday night's debate now we've got this Marco Rubio repeats
[18:37.080 --> 18:42.640]  same line again and this was during a stump speech after the debate so we've
[18:42.640 --> 18:48.080]  got this clip of Marco Rubio again acting like a wind-up toy here it is we are
[18:48.080 --> 18:51.760]  taking our message to families that are struggling to raise their children in
[18:51.760 --> 18:55.200]  the 21st century because as you saw Jeanette and I are raising our four
[18:55.200 --> 18:59.120]  children in the 21st century and we know how hard it's become to instill our
[18:59.120 --> 19:04.720]  values in our kids instead of the values they try to ram down our throats in the
[19:04.720 --> 19:08.440]  21st century it's become harder than ever to instill in your children the
[19:08.440 --> 19:11.840]  values they teach in our homes and in our church instead of the values that
[19:11.840 --> 19:18.080]  they try to ram down our throats in the movies and music in popular culture
[19:18.080 --> 19:22.080]  literally it's like one of those toys that you pull the cord and it's got
[19:22.080 --> 19:26.520]  like three stock phrases that it comes out with over and over again after the
[19:26.520 --> 19:31.440]  break we're gonna play this this other video clip where he actually debates
[19:31.440 --> 19:35.560]  himself he contradicts himself over and over again of course he's been claiming
[19:35.560 --> 19:40.440]  that Obama knows exactly what he's doing just a matter of weeks and months ago
[19:40.440 --> 19:44.520]  Rubio said the exact opposite we're gonna go to that clip after the break
[19:44.520 --> 19:49.600]  we've also got another yet another top security chief in Europe warning about
[19:49.600 --> 19:54.120]  mass civil unrest as a result of this mass immigration policy we'll be back

[26:15.960 --> 26:20.960]  directly now before the break we were talking about Marco Rubio of course got
[26:20.960 --> 26:24.960]  called out for basically being a wind-up toy repeating the same phrase over and
[26:24.960 --> 26:31.960]  over again claiming that Barack Obama knows exactly what he's doing well that
[26:31.960 --> 26:37.960]  struck a somewhat different tone to what Rubio himself was saying just a few
[26:37.960 --> 26:45.960]  months ago his Rubio versus Rubio Marco debates himself is the clip and let's
[26:45.960 --> 26:48.960]  dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what
[26:48.960 --> 26:52.960]  he's doing he knows exactly what he's doing I'm gonna say something I don't
[26:52.960 --> 26:56.960]  take lightly the American foreign policy is in the hands of someone who does not
[26:56.960 --> 27:06.960]  know what he's doing I think the experience is not just what you did but how
[27:06.960 --> 27:10.960]  it worked out but I would add this let's dispel with this fiction that Barack
[27:10.960 --> 27:13.960]  Obama doesn't know what he's doing he knows exactly what he's doing well
[27:13.960 --> 27:16.960]  people first of all are scared because they they sense the threat it continues
[27:16.960 --> 27:19.960]  to grow and the president doesn't know what he's doing we are not facing a
[27:19.960 --> 27:22.960]  president that doesn't know what he's doing he knows what he is doing I mean
[27:22.960 --> 27:26.960]  how can the American people have confidence that this president knows what he is doing
[27:26.960 --> 27:29.960]  well here's the response anyone who believes that Barack Obama isn't doing
[27:29.960 --> 27:32.960]  what he's doing on purpose doesn't understand what we're dealing with here
[27:32.960 --> 27:35.960]  we're talking about someone who does not know what he's doing
[27:35.960 --> 27:41.960]  there's Marco Rubio debating himself a few months ago he asserted that Barack
[27:41.960 --> 27:46.960]  Obama didn't know what he was doing now he says Obama knows exactly what he's
[27:46.960 --> 27:52.960]  doing which is funny you know because Marco Rubio has aligned with Obama on
[27:52.960 --> 27:57.960]  numerous different major issues so if Obama knows exactly what he's doing as
[27:57.960 --> 28:02.960]  Rubio claims now then Rubio would be in a perfect position to know that given that
[28:02.960 --> 28:08.960]  he's supported many of the same policies the primary one being Barack Obama's
[28:08.960 --> 28:14.960]  involvement in the Middle East and particularly Syria Marco Rubio has voted
[28:14.960 --> 28:21.960]  and he's rhetorically supported arming the jihadist rebels in Syria again and
[28:21.960 --> 28:26.960]  again to supposedly take on Russia now of course that was Barack Obama's
[28:26.960 --> 28:31.960]  disastrous policy right from the very beginning we pointed out that the quote
[28:31.960 --> 28:36.960]  Syrian rebels the FSA were in fact jihadists themselves we were proven
[28:36.960 --> 28:41.960]  completely correct more than half of them eventually turned out not to be
[28:41.960 --> 28:46.960]  moderate at all they ended up giving their weapons to ISIS defecting to
[28:46.960 --> 28:51.960]  Jabhat al-Nusra and these other al-Qaeda groups which created the bloodbath in
[28:51.960 --> 28:57.960]  Syria which created this mass immigration crisis that is now impacting Europe
[28:57.960 --> 29:02.960]  and will eventually impact America Barack Obama was responsible for that he
[29:02.960 --> 29:07.960]  posh for arming the jihadist rebels he ignored Assad he ignored a political
[29:07.960 --> 29:12.960]  solution for such a long time and at every step of the way Marco Rubio the
[29:12.960 --> 29:19.960]  fake conservative was behind him in that goal you can look at the NSA surveillance
[29:19.960 --> 29:25.960]  issue immediately after Paris massacre in November Rubio came out and attacked
[29:25.960 --> 29:31.960]  crews and said that we need more NSA surveillance in America to stop terror
[29:31.960 --> 29:34.960]  attacks like the one in Paris of course the attack in Paris couldn't have been
[29:34.960 --> 29:38.960]  stopped by more surveillance because the terrorists were directly communicating
[29:38.960 --> 29:42.960]  with each other and they came in via the refugee program we'll get more into it
[29:42.960 --> 29:47.960]  after the break it's the Alex Jones show live info.com
[29:47.960 --> 29:53.960]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:53.960 --> 29:57.960]  network
[29:58.960 --> 30:02.960]  a pro-abortion group is attacking a Doritos Super Bowl ad for humanizing baby
[30:02.960 --> 30:06.960]  fetuses in the ad a pregnant woman is getting an ultrasound why man besides
[30:06.960 --> 30:10.960]  her realizes the unborn baby will move in the direction of the Doritos he's
[30:10.960 --> 30:13.960]  snacking on the man toys with the baby attempting in vain to reach the chips from
[30:13.960 --> 30:16.960]  the womb until the mother throws the Doritos across the room which prompts
[30:16.960 --> 30:19.960]  the child to launch itself outside mom and towards the chips in response the
[30:19.960 --> 30:23.960]  national abortion reproductive rights action league said the ad used an
[30:23.960 --> 30:27.960]  anti-choice tactic of humanizing fetuses the statement are sourced out in
[30:27.960 --> 30:32.960]  oral and similar groups to humanize the unborn in a vain attempt to justify
[30:32.960 --> 30:35.960]  abortions especially in the aftermath of the Planned Parenthood sting videos
[30:35.960 --> 30:38.960]  exposing its officials admitting they sell aborted baby organs for profit
[30:38.960 --> 30:42.960]  Narrow however didn't stop there the group also called out a Snickers ad for
[30:42.960 --> 30:45.960]  being transphobic and a Hyundai ad for showing a dad take away his daughter's
[30:45.960 --> 30:49.960]  autonomy this is all part of the political correctness campaign spearheaded
[30:49.960 --> 30:53.960]  by the authoritarian left to not only control free speech but also how people

[33:20.960 --> 33:24.960]  and let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't

[33:36.960 --> 33:39.960]  but I would add this let's dispel with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't
[33:39.960 --> 33:43.960]  know what he's doing he knows exactly what he's doing back here's the bottom
[33:43.960 --> 33:46.960]  line this notion that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not
[33:46.960 --> 33:49.960]  there it is he knows exactly what he's doing
[33:49.960 --> 33:57.960]  well here's the response I think anyone who believes that Barack Obama isn't
[33:57.960 --> 34:00.960]  doing what he's doing on purpose doesn't understand what we're dealing with
[34:00.960 --> 34:04.960]  here okay this is a president this is a president who's trying to change this
[34:04.960 --> 34:06.960]  country
[34:09.960 --> 34:13.960]  find out more about the robotic politicians that want to enslave you at
[34:13.960 --> 34:23.960]  info wars dot com there's Marco Rubio saying that Obama knows exactly what
[34:23.960 --> 34:28.960]  he's doing contradicting himself from a few months ago in which he repeatedly
[34:28.960 --> 34:32.960]  said that he doesn't know what he's doing and Marco Rubio has aligned behind
[34:32.960 --> 34:37.960]  Obama on several key policy issues I described before the break arming the
[34:37.960 --> 34:43.960]  jihadist rebels at every step of the way Rubio was behind that policy that's
[34:43.960 --> 34:48.960]  led to the destruction of Syria and to the growth of ISIS of course the
[34:48.960 --> 34:52.960]  Pentagon in their own documents foresaw the growth of the Salafist
[34:52.960 --> 34:57.960]  Principality in other words ISIS long before it happened which is why they
[34:57.960 --> 35:02.960]  supported the jihadists in Libya and Syria in the first place because they
[35:02.960 --> 35:07.960]  wanted to topple Bashar al-Assad Marco Rubio has been behind that policy at
[35:07.960 --> 35:13.960]  every single step of the way he's also been behind beefing continuing NSA
[35:13.960 --> 35:17.960]  surveillance again falsely claiming that more surveillance would have stopped
[35:17.960 --> 35:22.960]  the Paris massacre when these people were coming in as refugees and once they
[35:22.960 --> 35:27.960]  got into Europe they were communicating with each other directly so Rubio has
[35:27.960 --> 35:32.960]  been proven wrong again and again now we got this article out of WorldNet
[35:32.960 --> 35:38.960]  Daily Phyllis Schlafly pulls back bail on Rubio's open borders record
[35:38.960 --> 35:42.960]  Senator Marco Rubio already struggling to consolidate the support of the
[35:42.960 --> 35:46.960]  Republican establishment after a disastrous weekend presidential race
[35:46.960 --> 35:51.960]  debate performance now has another obstacle in his quest for the party's
[35:51.960 --> 35:55.960]  nomination legendary conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly and her
[35:55.960 --> 35:59.960]  organization Eagle Forum have released a new report detailing what she called
[35:59.960 --> 36:05.960]  Rubio's long history of quote betraying conservatives the memo details
[36:05.960 --> 36:09.960]  specific promises made by Rubio to conservative supporters when he was
[36:09.960 --> 36:13.960]  running for Senate it also offers evidence of how he broke those vows once
[36:13.960 --> 36:18.960]  elected to the United States Senate at the top of the list is you guessed it
[36:18.960 --> 36:24.960]  amnesty for illegal immigrants so again years ago he was posing as being
[36:24.960 --> 36:29.960]  against amnesty for the millions of illegal immigrants in the United States
[36:29.960 --> 36:34.960]  now he's behind the gang of eight bill and again he's completely flip-flopped
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.960]  and he's aligned without the major planks of Obama's agenda so for him to
[36:39.960 --> 36:43.960]  you know put himself up against Obama and try not to look like part of the
[36:43.960 --> 36:49.960]  establishment is really pathetic once you dig into Rubio's actual record
[36:49.960 --> 36:54.960]  but according to Fox News who released the results of the New Hampshire primary
[36:54.960 --> 36:58.960]  early on their website before scrubbing them before taking it down when we
[36:58.960 --> 37:03.960]  pointed it out Rubio set to finish second that would be a surprise for many
[37:03.960 --> 37:09.960]  given his poor performance on Saturday night and even Rubio himself doesn't
[37:09.960 --> 37:14.960]  appear too confident this is at the Daily Mail Rubio dampens New Hampshire
[37:14.960 --> 37:19.960]  expectations as he says he could finish in second third or fourth and only the
[37:19.960 --> 37:24.960]  media is fixated on his robotic debate disaster Marco Rubio downplayed his
[37:24.960 --> 37:28.960]  chances of strong finish in New Hampshire on the morning of the first in the
[37:28.960 --> 37:32.960]  nation primary election saying he has no idea where he will finish and it could
[37:32.960 --> 37:38.960]  be in as low as fourth place so again very bizarre that he would come out with
[37:38.960 --> 37:44.960]  such negative statements maybe he's trying to reframe the result again the
[37:44.960 --> 37:48.960]  discussion is all about who's coming second who's coming third who's coming
[37:48.960 --> 37:53.960]  forth it's not going to be about Bernie Sanders or Donald Trump in fact when
[37:53.960 --> 37:57.960]  those inevitable victories happen they're going to try and diminish them by
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.960]  saying for example if you know Sanders doesn't be Clinton by double digits
[38:02.960 --> 38:07.960]  they're going to reframe that as a defeat for Bernie Sanders if Donald Trump
[38:07.960 --> 38:13.960]  only wins by 12 percentage points or less they're going to reframe that as we
[38:13.960 --> 38:18.960]  focused on yesterday with the Jeb Bush supporting GOP mayor they're going to
[38:18.960 --> 38:23.960]  reframe that as a defeat for Donald Trump so it's all about massaging the
[38:23.960 --> 38:28.960]  perspective in the aftermath of these results as they come in this is out of
[38:28.960 --> 38:33.960]  the telegraph while Trump and Sanders smell victory Hillary Clinton contemplates
[38:33.960 --> 38:38.960]  humiliation what will be a good result for Hillary in a race against Bernie
[38:38.960 --> 38:44.960]  Sanders I asked the Democrat he replied she'll be happy with second place of
[38:44.960 --> 38:48.960]  course those are the only two running in that particular race today's New
[38:48.960 --> 38:53.960]  Hampshire primary will be all about the post match rationalizations we expect
[38:53.960 --> 38:57.960]  Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump to win that's a foregone conclusion but the
[38:57.960 --> 39:03.960]  political establishment the pundits and the media can't even contemplate the
[39:03.960 --> 39:07.960]  thought of a Sanders versus Trump race so they'll put a wall around New
[39:07.960 --> 39:12.960]  Hampshire say that it didn't really matter and look ahead to the states to
[39:12.960 --> 39:17.960]  come ergo who comes second and how close to first they come could dominate
[39:17.960 --> 39:21.960]  media interest so that's what it's all going to be about with this New
[39:21.960 --> 39:25.960]  Hampshire primary they're going to try and denigrate the victories of
[39:25.960 --> 39:30.960]  Trump and Sanders by pushing up these establishment candidates even if which
[39:30.960 --> 39:35.960]  it looks completely likely in the case of Sanders and Clinton that Clinton
[39:35.960 --> 39:40.960]  trails him by double digits so that's what we want have to watch out for in
[39:40.960 --> 39:44.960]  the aftermath of this New Hampshire primary now of course we've got Richard
[39:44.960 --> 39:48.960]  Reeves who is on the ground in New Hampshire and he's just come out with
[39:48.960 --> 39:53.960]  this special report in which he talks to a Donald Trump campaign strategist on
[39:53.960 --> 39:58.960]  how Trump will make America great again here's the clip Richard Reeves with
[39:58.960 --> 40:02.960]  info wars dot com at the Red Arrow diner with Steve Miller what's your
[40:02.960 --> 40:06.960]  position with the Trump campaign again I'm the senior policy advisor so as
[40:06.960 --> 40:09.960]  senior policy advisor what are you really looking what are the top issues
[40:09.960 --> 40:12.960]  that you're working on well two of the biggest ones are trade and immigration
[40:12.960 --> 40:15.960]  and that's a lot of what this lesson comes down to and of course Alex Jones
[40:15.960 --> 40:19.960]  and info wars have been on top of this for a long time both on the
[40:19.960 --> 40:23.960]  trans-Pacific partnership and on the immigration issue and all the different
[40:23.960 --> 40:26.960]  facets of it so it's really great to be talking to you today but my short
[40:26.960 --> 40:30.960]  message for your audience would be that if you want to stop the trans-Pacific
[40:30.960 --> 40:34.960]  partnership if you want to close the border if you want to protect American
[40:34.960 --> 40:37.960]  jobs and wages then you have to support Donald Trump he's the only person who's
[40:37.960 --> 40:41.960]  been clear and consistent and firm on these issues and who isn't relying on
[40:41.960 --> 40:45.960]  large special interests and donors well he clearly does appear to be the most
[40:45.960 --> 40:50.960]  serious candidate on that issue and he's I'm convinced that he will actually
[40:50.960 --> 40:53.960]  get Mexico to even pay for the wall as well right there's no doubt that he
[40:53.960 --> 40:56.960]  will he's a businessman he knows how to get stuff done and the reality is that
[40:56.960 --> 40:59.960]  we have all the leverage of Mexico they send billions of dollars home every
[40:59.960 --> 41:03.960]  year and what are called remittances right which is that illegal immigrants
[41:03.960 --> 41:06.960]  make money here and they send it back home Mexico's economy depends on it
[41:06.960 --> 41:11.960]  Mexico's economy depends upon us being outsourced sending our jobs and
[41:11.960 --> 41:15.960]  factories to Mexico they depend upon tourism for the United States they depend
[41:15.960 --> 41:19.960]  upon the ability of their workers to cross our border and come to the United
[41:19.960 --> 41:25.960]  States every single day by the thousands so they have enormous dependency upon
[41:25.960 --> 41:28.960]  the United States so we have all the leverage and we're not using it so we
[41:28.960 --> 41:32.960]  can absolutely get them to pay for the border wall right and then add to that
[41:32.960 --> 41:37.960]  the cost of American jobs Americans don't get the jobs they should for the
[41:37.960 --> 41:41.960]  pay that they should right and so the flip side of this of course is that well
[41:41.960 --> 41:45.960]  Mexico is making all the money off of the outsourced jobs making money off of
[41:45.960 --> 41:49.960]  the remittance payments from the illegal alien workers making money off of the
[41:49.960 --> 41:53.960]  guest worker programs and everything else American workers are losing out and
[41:53.960 --> 41:56.960]  that's why we have seen no wage growth in fact we've seen wage declines that's
[41:56.960 --> 41:59.960]  what we've seen huge numbers of people not working at all look at the construction
[41:59.960 --> 42:03.960]  industry how many construction workers across America right now are unemployed
[42:03.960 --> 42:07.960]  or have given up on construction all together our open border has betrayed
[42:07.960 --> 42:11.960]  American workers in many industries and construction of course is one of the
[42:11.960 --> 42:15.960]  hardest hit and Don J. Trump is going to turn that around now you mentioned TPP
[42:15.960 --> 42:19.960]  a little while ago is Mr. Trump fully aware of the ramifications of the
[42:19.960 --> 42:23.960]  passage of TPP that it would actually pretty much wipe out U.S. sovereignty
[42:23.960 --> 42:27.960]  and open those floodgates to immigration yes so that's one of the things that
[42:27.960 --> 42:30.960]  he's been clearest on and again if you look at the way we've had eight debates
[42:30.960 --> 42:36.960]  now I think and has anyone else in any of the debates besides Mr. Trump laid
[42:36.960 --> 42:40.960]  out a clear trade policy and specifically as he did the last debate
[42:40.960 --> 42:44.960]  opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership the answers has only been
[42:44.960 --> 42:49.960]  Mr. Trump and so if you want to protect U.S. sovereignty then you need to vote
[42:49.960 --> 42:52.960]  for Donald J. Trump and I'm confident the millions of patriotic Americans all
[42:52.960 --> 42:58.960]  across this country who care about their jobs and wages are thrilled by the fact
[42:58.960 --> 43:01.960]  that we have a candidate and a businessman who's going to stand up for
[43:01.960 --> 43:06.960]  American workers on the TPP all right well now what did you think about the
[43:06.960 --> 43:11.960]  debate last Saturday with the the way the audience was kind of rigged in favor
[43:11.960 --> 43:14.960]  of the governor's what do you think about that well I think it was again is one
[43:14.960 --> 43:18.960]  of the reasons why people love Mr. Trump is that he tells the truth he tells
[43:18.960 --> 43:22.960]  the truth I'm sure all of us have watched these debates and wondered why sometimes
[43:22.960 --> 43:26.960]  the audiences seem to applaud for things that you know you would think that your
[43:26.960 --> 43:30.960]  typical blue-collar worker wouldn't applaud for or to jeer things that you
[43:30.960 --> 43:33.960]  think your typical blue-collar worker wouldn't jeer they doesn't seem to
[43:33.960 --> 43:37.960]  seem to be sort of a mismatch between audience reaction sometimes and how
[43:37.960 --> 43:41.960]  your typical Republican voter earning a working-class wage might react and
[43:41.960 --> 43:44.960]  Donald Trump basically pulled back the curtain he explained that you know our
[43:44.960 --> 43:47.960]  campaign gets 20 tickets and that the most tickets are going to donors and
[43:47.960 --> 43:51.960]  special interest and you talk to people every day Republican voters they can't
[43:51.960 --> 43:53.960]  get tickets these things. When was the last time you were offered a ticket to
[43:53.960 --> 43:56.960]  debate? Well and it's great thing he called out the audience because that was
[43:56.960 --> 43:59.960]  actually probably a winning moment in the debate right there. Right because most
[43:59.960 --> 44:03.960]  Americans aren't large donors that's the whole point is Mr. Trump is appealing
[44:03.960 --> 44:07.960]  to as he will in a general election people who don't have large check
[44:07.960 --> 44:10.960]  accounts to write checks to politicians he's appealing to people to go to work
[44:10.960 --> 44:15.960]  every day for a living. And the GOP in my estimation plans on what they did to
[44:15.960 --> 44:19.960]  that debate that's what they plan on doing in Cleveland in July is stacking
[44:19.960 --> 44:24.960]  that delegation full of GOP hardline establishment folks. The easiest thing to
[44:24.960 --> 44:29.960]  do if we want to have Donald J. Trump be our nominee is to show up and vote
[44:29.960 --> 44:33.960]  tomorrow in New Hampshire and then to vote in South Carolina and all across
[44:33.960 --> 44:37.960]  this country and that will guarantee I assure you that Donald J. Trump will be
[44:37.960 --> 44:41.960]  the Republican nominee and millions and millions of people are joining this
[44:41.960 --> 44:46.960]  movement and is going to truly make America great again. And beyond that folks
[44:46.960 --> 44:49.960]  get to your precinct conventions and precinct caucuses because that's the road
[44:49.960 --> 44:53.960]  to Cleveland. Steve Miller thank you so much. Thank you great to be here.
[44:53.960 --> 44:58.960]  Richard Reeves live on the ground in New Hampshire talking to a Donald Trump
[44:58.960 --> 45:03.960]  campaign representative and WorldNet Daily also has a story out today about
[45:03.960 --> 45:07.960]  Trump's comments that he made to Michael Savage in an interview yesterday.
[45:07.960 --> 45:13.960]  Trump to Savage maybe Obama doesn't want to defeat ISIS in another wide-ranging
[45:13.960 --> 45:17.960]  interview with talk radio host Michael Savage. Republican presidential candidate
[45:17.960 --> 45:22.960]  Donald Trump suggests that President Obama might not have a desire to defeat
[45:22.960 --> 45:26.960]  the Islamic jihadist group ISIS. The real estate billionaire shied away from
[45:26.960 --> 45:31.960]  declaring he would win the New Hampshire primary Tuesday. Trump repeated his
[45:31.960 --> 45:35.960]  observation that President Obama refuses to identify the enemy as radical
[45:35.960 --> 45:39.960]  Islamic terrorism insisting ISIS and other groups have nothing to do with
[45:39.960 --> 45:43.960]  Islam. Well of course this is we've seen Obama come up with this kind of statement
[45:43.960 --> 45:49.960]  again and again. We've seen him even refer to the Christian crusades to try
[45:49.960 --> 45:54.960]  and absolve Islam of blame when it comes to radical jihadist terror and now
[45:54.960 --> 45:59.960]  Trump's pointing that out. He told Savage quote maybe he doesn't want to get rid
[45:59.960 --> 46:04.960]  of the problem. I don't know exactly what's going on. Well of course we know
[46:04.960 --> 46:09.960]  but from back in November we report on the fact that the White House the Obama
[46:09.960 --> 46:15.960]  White House was giving ISIS a 45 minute warning before bombing its oil tankers.
[46:15.960 --> 46:21.960]  They had the opportunity to bomb these oil tankers for 15 months during the
[46:21.960 --> 46:26.960]  conflict in Syria completely failed to do so. Of course then Russia came along
[46:26.960 --> 46:32.960]  and destroyed more than 1000 tankers in just five days after the US had
[46:32.960 --> 46:37.960]  destroyed non over a period of 15 months. The rationalization of course was
[46:37.960 --> 46:43.960]  that they didn't want to create an environmental catastrophe. And again it
[46:43.960 --> 46:47.960]  goes back to this Pentagon document I've talked about again and again. They
[46:47.960 --> 46:51.960]  foresaw the rise of ISIS. They saw that as a positive development because it
[46:51.960 --> 46:57.960]  would achieve their wider objective of destabilizing Bashar al-Assad. They
[46:57.960 --> 47:03.960]  foresaw the rise of a Salafist principality. In other words ISIS. So for
[47:03.960 --> 47:08.960]  15 months they basically did nothing. ISIS spread throughout the region then
[47:08.960 --> 47:13.960]  Russia comes along again drops thousands of thousands of pounds of bombs and
[47:13.960 --> 47:18.960]  destroys 1000 oil tankers in just five days. Now ISIS is on the run. They're
[47:18.960 --> 47:24.960]  losing territory. The FSA rebels many of whom are aligned with ISIS in Aleppo
[47:24.960 --> 47:29.960]  are about to lose that territory. The media's framing it as some massive
[47:29.960 --> 47:33.960]  defeat that these jihadist rebels who like to cut people's hearts out on
[47:33.960 --> 47:37.960]  camera and eat them. That that's somehow a bad thing that they're going to be
[47:37.960 --> 47:42.960]  wiped out of the region. So we see that narrative continuing. But Trump's
[47:42.960 --> 47:46.960]  right in identifying the fact that Obama's complete inaction on fighting
[47:46.960 --> 47:51.960]  ISIS for so long. Actually giving the people who drive their oil tankers
[47:51.960 --> 47:56.960]  45 minutes warning is a key element in suggesting that maybe he didn't want
[47:56.960 --> 48:01.960]  to rid them from the region. So now those comments to Michael Savage are
[48:01.960 --> 48:06.960]  especially interesting. Jane Fonda's come out. This is from Breitbart and
[48:06.960 --> 48:11.960]  said that Trump's racism is turning young Muslims into terrorists. That's
[48:11.960 --> 48:16.960]  right. It's not the Quran that directs young Muslims to kill the non believers.
[48:16.960 --> 48:21.960]  It's all Donald Trump's fault. Actress and feminist activist Jane Fonda who of
[48:21.960 --> 48:26.960]  course has said nothing whatsoever about the migrant rape scandal that sweeping
[48:26.960 --> 48:30.960]  Europe putting thousands of young women at risk. You know an actual feminist
[48:30.960 --> 48:34.960]  course not a word on it. Jane Fonda has accused Republican presidential
[48:34.960 --> 48:37.960]  front-runner Donald Trump of driving young Muslims to participate in
[48:37.960 --> 48:41.960]  terrorism. Speaking at the Women's Equality and ERA Coalition's Night of
[48:41.960 --> 48:47.960]  Comedy quite appropriate in New York City yesterday the 78 year old accused
[48:47.960 --> 48:52.960]  Trump of fanning the flames of people's anxieties and racism. It's terrible and
[48:52.960 --> 48:56.960]  dangerous. Fonda said of Trump's candidacy two days ahead of the New
[48:56.960 --> 49:01.960]  Hampshire primary. So because Trump offered this proposal to temporarily
[49:01.960 --> 49:06.960]  temporarily limit Muslim immigration into the United States he's to blame for
[49:06.960 --> 49:11.960]  the future terrorist attacks. Where have we heard this before? We heard it
[49:11.960 --> 49:17.960]  after Charlie Hebdo where the regressive left blamed the cartoonists for
[49:17.960 --> 49:22.960]  provoking the special snowflake Muslims and offending their feelings
[49:22.960 --> 49:27.960]  basically blaming them for their own slaughter. We saw it again in the
[49:27.960 --> 49:31.960]  aftermath of Garland, Texas and we're going to see it over and over again
[49:31.960 --> 49:36.960]  which is why now we've got police agencies in Europe covering up many
[49:36.960 --> 49:41.960]  of these incidents involving migrant crimes and acts of terror so as not
[49:41.960 --> 49:47.960]  to disrupt this narrative that it's all based in grievance and it's the racist
[49:47.960 --> 49:52.960]  offensive rhetoric of the riot that's causing these Muslims to act out
[49:52.960 --> 49:55.960]  because otherwise they'd be completely peaceful right because it's not as if
[49:55.960 --> 50:00.960]  they throw gaze off building stone women to death kill people who leave the
[50:00.960 --> 50:05.960]  faith of Islam when there's no external influence whatsoever you can't blame
[50:05.960 --> 50:10.960]  that on US foreign policy or Donald Trump's comments when it's enshrined
[50:10.960 --> 50:15.960]  into their system of law when it's enshrined in the Quran the directives
[50:15.960 --> 50:20.960]  that they follow that cannot be blamed on Donald Trump but this migrant
[50:20.960 --> 50:26.960]  situation is escalating and again every single day more reports of rapes more
[50:26.960 --> 50:31.960]  reports of assaults more stabbings and now we've got a Norwegian police chief
[50:31.960 --> 50:36.960]  who is warning that mass immigration could could threaten civil unrest and
[50:36.960 --> 50:41.960]  mass disorder across Europe she's not the first one to say that by no means

[55:43.960 --> 55:48.960]  infowarslife.com now this is a story we've been tracking for a while and we
[55:48.960 --> 55:52.960]  got another top story about it up on infowars.com Norwegian police chief
[55:52.960 --> 55:57.960]  warns mass immigration threatened civil unrest influx of Muslim asylum seekers
[55:57.960 --> 56:02.960]  will have quote unfortunate consequences and we've seen a lot of those
[56:02.960 --> 56:07.960]  unfortunate consequences so far with this mass rape scandal sweeping Europe
[56:07.960 --> 56:11.960]  but the head of Norway's police security service warns that the importation
[56:11.960 --> 56:16.960]  of large numbers of migrants who fail to assimilate into western society
[56:16.960 --> 56:22.960]  that's right defecating in swimming pools is not a form of assimilation could
[56:22.960 --> 56:27.960]  spark civil unrest and a groundswell of right wing extremism and this is the
[56:27.960 --> 56:33.960]  point I've made again and again when the regressive left stands down and
[56:33.960 --> 56:39.960]  aligns with Islamists that only creates a vacuum because so-called liberals
[56:39.960 --> 56:44.960]  aren't standing up for liberal principles so what does that create a vacuum
[56:44.960 --> 56:49.960]  for actual neo-nazis and extremists to fill the void which is why you see so
[56:49.960 --> 56:53.960]  many of these attacks now occurring on the streets of Europe where it's
[56:53.960 --> 56:58.960]  extremists attacking migrants many of whom will be innocent people that's not
[56:58.960 --> 57:03.960]  on us that's on the regressive left for failing to stand up for liberal
[57:03.960 --> 57:08.960]  principles it's created that backlash censoring people who make critical
[57:08.960 --> 57:13.960]  comments about their government's migration policy on Facebook and Twitter
[57:13.960 --> 57:18.960]  giving them police home visits as happened in the Netherlands that's going
[57:18.960 --> 57:24.960]  to create an increased backlash they know that which is why top security
[57:24.960 --> 57:28.960]  experts are now warning about it including Benedict Bjornland who is the
[57:28.960 --> 57:33.960]  head of Norway's SSP who during a security and defence conference in Sweden
[57:33.960 --> 57:36.960]  said that the recent surge in asylum seekers from muslim countries could
[57:36.960 --> 57:41.960]  have enforced unfortunate consequences including violent clashes quote one
[57:41.960 --> 57:45.960]  cannot take for granted that new population groups automatically adapt
[57:45.960 --> 57:50.960]  to the norms and regulations in Norwegian society new populations are not
[57:50.960 --> 57:54.960]  homogeneous and they can bring their ethnic or religious differences from
[57:54.960 --> 57:59.960]  their homeland and that's exactly what we've seen especially in Sweden and
[57:59.960 --> 58:04.960]  Norway with people being attacked raped on the streets and the police
[58:04.960 --> 58:10.960]  organisations there ordered to cover it up so as not to legitimise critics of
[58:10.960 --> 58:15.960]  mass immigration these warnings have also been sent out by German security
[58:15.960 --> 58:20.960]  experts and Jill Merkel they've been sent out by French security experts we've
[58:20.960 --> 58:25.960]  now got the French army preparing for immigrant uprisings in these Muslim
[58:25.960 --> 58:30.960]  ghettos and they're preparing to take back national territory this is the mass
[58:30.960 --> 58:33.960]  civil unrest that's coming to Europe we may get some more of this and to your
[58:33.960 --> 58:40.960]  calls after the break this is the Alex Show Show Live InfoWars.com
[58:40.960 --> 59:03.960]  Go to infowarslife.com today and read the testimonials for yourself there are
[59:03.960 --> 59:14.960]  four
[59:14.960 --> 59:37.960]  that are blocked by estrogen mimickers and other toxic elements in the food
[59:37.960 --> 59:45.960]  now it's time to get your body in balance and fight back I'm Alex Jones for
[59:45.960 --> 59:50.960]  SupermoveItality and infowarslife.com and I salute you our supporters
[59:50.960 --> 59:55.960]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[59:55.960 --> 01:00:13.960]  second hour of the Alex Jones show live we've got Tommy Robinson coming up in
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:18.960]  the third hour we're going to go to your calls here in the next segment we've got
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:25.960]  Aaron Charles and Jesse please call in at 1-800-259-9231 that's 1-800-259-9231
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:29.960]  we're talking about the New Hampshire primary we're talking about the Muslim
[01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:34.960]  migrant crisis and basically any other issue that you want to bring up before
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:38.960]  the break I was talking about the head of Norway's police security service who
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:42.960]  basically says that these Muslim migrants aren't going to assimilate into
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:48.960]  Western society and it's going to create civil unrest and mass disorder now
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.960]  these comments are similar in nature to those made by the Norwegian army chief
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.960]  Odin Johansson who recently remarked that Europe must be prepared to fight to
[01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:02.960]  defend its values against the threat posed by radical Islam those were his
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:07.960]  words also the Swedish Army General Anders Brandstrom has ordered his troops
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:12.960]  to prepare for a war in Europe against skilled opponents within a few years
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:17.960]  we also had the Swiss Army Chief Andre Blackman warning that the risk of
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.960]  social unrest in Europe was intensifying and he came out and said citizens
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:27.960]  should arm themselves which is exactly what people in Germany and Austria are
[01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:32.960]  trying to do they're buying up supplies of pepper spray non-lethal weapons
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:37.960]  whatever they can get their hands on meanwhile police in other European
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:42.960]  countries like Norway releasing videos saying that women should just use the
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:49.960]  force to repel potential rapists as if some kind of invisible energy field can
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:55.960]  make a determined rapist back away again no call for them to use any kind of
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:02:01.960]  self-defense or weaponry whatsoever we had the mayor in Cologne saying oh just
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.960]  keep potential rapists at arms length because that's really going to deter
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:09.960]  them isn't it and before the break I was talking about the regressive left
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.960]  failing once again to stand up for actual liberal principles leaving a vacuum
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:20.960]  that is being filled by extremists now we have this story out of France 24 all
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:25.960]  too predictable once again Swedish police arrest 14 for planning asylum
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:30.960]  center attack Swedish police said Tuesday they arrested 14 men for allegedly
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.960]  planning to attack an asylum center after finding axes knives and iron pipes in
[01:02:35.960 --> 01:02:41.960]  their cars the suspects were all carrying foreign ID papers adding some of them
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:47.960]  were Polish nationals living and working in Sweden now Poland even if you speak
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.960]  to people from Poland will admit that's a very racist country they actually
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.960]  you know throw bananas at black football players and things like that these
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:03:00.960]  extremists are now the ones that living in Sweden are now planning attacks on
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:05.960]  asylum centers because again this whole narrative has has bolstered the
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:11.960]  extreme right because censorship only creates more problems you have the
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:16.960]  starsy in Germany actual former members of the starsy working with the
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:21.960]  German government working with Facebook to censor quote hate speech about
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:26.960]  migrants online you actually dig in to what they characterize as hate speech
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:31.960]  and for example it's somebody who said they thought their government's policy
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:37.960]  on refugees was quote a bad plan that's supposedly hateful rhetoric according
[01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:42.960]  to the to the authorities and in that case he got a home visit so you're
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.960]  own you're only going to create a bigger backlash if you camp down and
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:53.960]  censor on legitimate criticism of this issue which is why we're seeing more
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.960]  and more attacks meanwhile over in Germany Breitbart is reporting
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:03.960]  Islamic State commander found living as refugee in rural German village in
[01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.960]  the latest of a series of braves German police have searched two homes in a
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:10.960]  rural village after a television channel interviewed a suspected Islamic
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:15.960]  State commander living there as a refugee this is in the small town of
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:21.960]  San Johann south west Germany and basically they found an ISIS commander
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:26.960]  living there not even in a major city just in a small village remember the
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:31.960]  Paris massacre terrorists bragged about how they abused and exploited the
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:37.960]  refugee program to enter into Europe we've also had refugees found in
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:43.960]  German migrant camps that are admitted members of ISIS we have hundreds of
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.960]  migrants coming into Italy found with the headings on their cell phones and
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:52.960]  pictures of ISIS flag so this continues to intensify we'll get more into it
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:58.960]  after the break and your calls on the eyes don't show why don't always if
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.960]  polls are to be believed Hillary Clinton's once commanding national lead
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.960]  over Bernie Sanders appears to have evaporated in a matter of days pointing
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:10.960]  to trouble ahead for the former secretary of state as voters cast their
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:15.960]  ballots Tuesday in Sanders friendly New Hampshire reports Fox News a recent
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:20.960]  Reuters poll shows Clinton leading Sanders 48 to 45 while state polls are
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:24.960]  far better indicators going into each individual primary national polls
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:28.960]  help gauge the candidates broader appeal over the past several months
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.960]  Clinton has at times led the national polls by more than 30 points
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.960]  contributing to her front-runner label even as she has faced tough races in
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:40.960]  Iowa and New Hampshire but Sanders may be heading for a big win in New
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.960]  Hampshire Tuesday night if he can hold off Clinton who has gotten tougher on
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:48.960]  the Vermont senator in recent days as her husband Bill Clinton ratchets up
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:06:07.960]  his attacks you can find more reports on info wars dot com

[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:23.960]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.960]  live Tuesday we're live broadcasted old Mr. Jones is getting along in the
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:33.960]  toot I'll be 42 coming up in about 48 hours again I want to thank everybody
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:39.960]  for joining us I am reaching you via phone right now there's the data plan on
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:43.960]  my cell phone and my Skype has gone complete for so long but we have a
[01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:47.960]  very very important three hours spanning out before us we've already obviously
[01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.960]  done one hour here with Paul Joseph Watson hosting from our returning
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.960]  majesties London England and then of course going into the fourth hour today
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:08:59.960]  we have another one of the great crew that's going to be hosting as well we're
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:04.960]  going to be cruising here today at about 35,000 feet and we should be able to
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:09.960]  get into this eugenics command base just about on time so the cancer viruses are
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.960]  being loaded in the vaccines and the brainwashing is accelerating on
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.960]  television and there's lots of football they're by just lean back and enjoy
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:22.960]  when you wake up you'll be dead so let's continue on now with some of the things
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:27.960]  that are on the menu today now let's get serious ladies and gentlemen I'm
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:30.960]  sitting here looking at these newspapers in front of me I'm sitting here looking
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:35.960]  at info wars calm I'm sitting here thinking about the whole compendium of
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:41.960]  what's happening in our world and I don't get into the whole esoteric or into the
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:48.960]  fundamentals for that matter or into the hidden for no reason I don't do it out
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:53.960]  of lack of material we have an abundance of information to cover here that's new
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:59.960]  and breaking and we will this hour but when I sit back and I think about the
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:05.960]  illusion that the leader involved there that you can screw over your fellow
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:11.960]  humans midterm or long term and get away with it not have it come back on you
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.960]  that that sense of justice that that sense of community that that sense of
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.960]  being together on spaceship earth in this great experience that the
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:28.960]  establishment not only is against that but the system has set up a religion of
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:34.960]  hating humanity and I know I've talked about this a lot but it it it really
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:41.960]  really hit me last night today when we talk about continental rabbits a European
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:49.960]  species of diminutive rabbit we don't talk about male rabbits and female
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:54.960]  rabbits we don't talk about all those males boy they're there they sure are
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:58.960]  hateful and abusive those of them they kick the female and we don't talk about
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:04.960]  as female rabbits we don't talk about rabbits as baby rabbits we talk about
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:10.960]  rabbits as rabbits as a species now humans humans are a little bit different
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:16.960]  than rabbits we we build giant complex cities we build spaceships we build
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:22.960]  computers that are probably already sent in we build biological weapons we paint
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:27.960]  double pieces of art and it's in that celebration of the human experience
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.960]  and realizing just how special we are that we do find our transcendence
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.960]  because it's along that path of believing in the nobler savage that we
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:42.960]  come out of the dark ages into the new development of humanity that God has
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:48.960]  planned for us all but then I think about the establishment of the social
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:53.960]  engineers the people that know the secrets of humanity the people that that know
[01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.960]  the secrets to a great extent of the universe compared to the general public
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.960]  and to know that they have those keys Solomon's keys if you would that's what
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:08.960]  they are and that they would not give those to the people is the ultimate sin
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:14.960]  and their argument is oh well we don't give it to the public because they're
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:19.960]  profane they are not enlightened they're not proven they're not higher order
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:25.960]  enough no it's it's a fraud that's one of the greatest lies right there to use
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:35.960]  the allegory of Arthur pin dragon and the sword in the stone and Merlin device
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:43.960]  the sword was always there for any to try to pull it from the stone
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.960]  think about that so the globalists claim you can't understand this esoteric
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:52.960]  knowledge if you're not one of them and therefore the public's been kept from
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:57.960]  the knowledge but the truth is the stone does not fit on the rock on the edge of
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:05.960]  town in the woods on a hill they hide the sword they bury the sword they put
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:12.960]  thousands of thousands of tons of rubble on top of the sword they persecute
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:18.960]  attack anyone that ever says there was a sword but there was a rock they don't
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:24.960]  want you to be able to try for the sword because they are unworthy of the
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:29.960]  sword they tried to pull the sword they know there's a sword but they're not
[01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:36.960]  enlightened they're not empowered they couldn't pull it and so they tell you
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:43.960]  they pulled the sword they tell you they've got a secret but they tell you
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:48.960]  you're profane and fallen and so you can't try for it and the truth is they
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:53.960]  themselves are not worthy and so they want to end the contest there and end
[01:13:53.960 --> 01:13:58.960]  the development and the transcendence of humanity because they themselves are
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:05.960]  falling and in that is the secret of the devil's mind you stare into the spirit
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:13.960]  of this world and it only seeks to keep us from going to the next level and the
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:19.960]  engineers stand back knowing basic building blocks of humanity and keeping
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:24.960]  it from the public and using culture and media to turn the population into the
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:31.960]  most servile rat-like mindless gibbering hordes of foaming frothing
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:38.960]  zombies and they look at us with their diseased eyes the engineers and say look
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:46.960]  how low you are look how far you've fallen look at how pathetic you are but
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:52.960]  you know who's even lower than those zombies are the magicians and the
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:58.960]  kings of the earth the sorcerers the trafficked men souls who would try to
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:08.960]  bring a people a race down that low so they could play God and actually play God
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:17.960]  you were no God at all you couldn't even comprehend the idea of a real God and
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:22.960]  that's why everything that comes out of you is ugliness the system with our
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:26.960]  ingenuity and our technology and our developments and everything given to us
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:33.960]  by the creator to build what we are destined to create so far it's all
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:40.960]  bishop and child's play they build this world using our minds our art our souls
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:48.960]  and then tell us that they were the authors of it again because they could
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:53.960]  not pull the sword from the stone and the truth is the sword's already gone
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:59.960]  because humanity from the age of fire and the wheel right through to Jesus Christ
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:06.960]  himself and on already pulled ex caliber from that rock we already have ex
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:11.960]  caliber in our hands and that's why the enemy hates our guts because they
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:15.960]  tried to bury it they tried to obscure it they tried to lie about it they try
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:21.960]  to say it never existed they tried to put us in the age of children denying
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:25.960]  that there is subterfuge denying that there are secrets denying that there is
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:30.960]  good and evil denying that there is free will you go pay a hundred thousand
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.960]  dollars to send your child to an average four-year education or two hundred
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:38.960]  thousand or three hundred thousand to an Ivy League education and all they're
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:42.960]  taught is how to hate themselves and how to be cynical and how they have no
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.960]  free will and no soul and no destiny and how they can hate other people below
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:51.960]  them they're being taught the opposite of what it is to be strong the opposite
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:55.960]  of what it is to be enlightened the opposite of what it is to truly be a
[01:16:55.960 --> 01:17:01.960]  creature made in God's image and these enemies realize that their age is
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:10.960]  coming to an end their fall foretold is upon us the next decade is the
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:18.960]  seminal test and through this crucible of fire we will as a species go to the
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:22.960]  next level and yes we see the tricks we see the frauds we see the public
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:28.960]  rejecting Marco Rubio and Hillary Clinton and Jeff Bush rejecting it
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:31.960]  desperately with a Bernie Sanders rejecting it desperately with a
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:37.960]  Donald Trump whether they're good or bad they represent a desperate struggle
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:43.960]  and it's only the beginning and the public believes because we see one
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:47.960]  more con game one more fraud one more battle loss that we're losing we're
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:54.960]  not because we're gaining ground every day every week every year towards an
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:01.960]  understanding of who we are as a species and no amount of Beyonce no amount of
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:07.960]  Kanye West no amount of NFL football with the winning quarterback plugging
[01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:15.960]  Budweiser in product placement no amount of that fake fraud will fill a human
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:20.960]  heart and that's why the globalists have a problem because they claim that they
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:24.960]  have the depths and they can fill the cup until it runs over when they are
[01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:31.960]  empty all they can do is like vampires feed on us and redistribute our wealth
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:39.960]  our minds our souls our creativity and then claim that they themselves deployed
[01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:45.960]  a great example we had a computer programmer consultant for a few years
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:50.960]  that came into the workforce and he was from Venezuela same was Max and he
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:54.960]  said listen I have family in Venezuela they had a private school for decades
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:58.960]  but it was taken over by the government they still work there basically or they
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:01.960]  could just go out live in the street but they're basically paid nothing and he
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:07.960]  said they they and I believed it but but years later a few years ago was actually
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:11.960]  in the news was actually caught on video cotton you know that they put it in
[01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:15.960]  his papers there they actually pray to Shavas now as a saint in the schools now
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:19.960]  these dead and say Shavas give us milk give us cereal so the poor kids coming to
[01:19:19.960 --> 01:19:24.960]  the school and there's milk and cereal distributed by the government and they
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.960]  first say pray to Jesus and the children close their eyes and pray to Jesus
[01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:33.960]  and they're hungry there's no food and then there's no food they say now pray to
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:38.960]  Hugo Shavas and pray to the socialist and when they open their eyes there is milk
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:43.960]  and there is cereal but the truth is Hugo Shavas didn't produce that milk and
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.960]  cereal people working hard in the fields produced it and that's who these
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:52.960]  parasites are they want us to think they produce the bounty whether nothing
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.960]  but parasites redistributed the wealth we'll be back with Paul Watson a lot more

[01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:27.960]  I'm just sitting here looking at the headlines
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:30.960]  that are on info wars.com
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:32.960]  that are on rogerport.com
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.960]  and just look at these headlines
[01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.960]  Obama's newest executive order
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:40.960]  what's killing US life expectancy
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.960]  top intelligence official ISIS likely to attempt
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:46.960]  US attacks this year
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.960]  Clinton supporters
[01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.960]  rile young women
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:55.960]  Obama's last budget aims to vex
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:59.960]  and it just goes on and on
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:03.960]  but look at this what's killing US life expectancy
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:07.960]  oh and they've got a bunch of excuses and the rest of it
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.960]  here's the biggest news anybody out there really
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.960]  who cares about their own life their own family's life should know
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:17.960]  and I've said this many times but I've looked at the actuaries
[01:25:17.960 --> 01:25:20.960]  I've looked at the demographics anybody can look this up
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.960]  until indoor plumbing
[01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:26.960]  and until people began to watch their clothes
[01:25:26.960 --> 01:25:30.960]  and learn to watch their hands with disinfectants and things
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:33.960]  the number one cause of death
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.960]  period was infectious disease
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:38.960]  vaccines had nothing to do with bringing those numbers down
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.960]  it was indoor plumbing and then even mainline
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:43.960]  historians admit that
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:46.960]  but if you go to a cemetery
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:48.960]  and we've got a family cemetery
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.960]  on our ranch we've had since before
[01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.960]  before Texas was Texas to these Texas
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:56.960]  it's full of Johnsons and Joneses and Browns
[01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:59.960]  all my ancestors on my dad's side
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.960]  and out there
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.960]  about 40% of the gravestones
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.960]  are for people under the age of 10
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.960]  and if that 40% or so
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:11.960]  I think I want to make a documentary or do a piece
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.960]  I'm going to show that old graveyard
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:15.960]  hundreds of gemstones a lot of trees have fallen over
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:17.960]  you can't read some of them
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.960]  some of them say killed by Indians
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:21.960]  it's pretty wild
[01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.960]  but you look at those tombstones
[01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.960]  and of the 40% or so
[01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:27.960]  that are under the age of 10
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:29.960]  most of those, the vast majority
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:31.960]  are below the age of three
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:33.960]  there's little angels carved in the stone
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.960]  and sweet little Betsy
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:38.960]  sweet little Jesse went home to Jesus
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:40.960]  and the truth is
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:43.960]  is that someone in the 1820s
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.960]  if they live past the age of 10
[01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:47.960]  live longer than we do today
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:52.960]  the issue is they calculate infant mortality
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.960]  we're around the third of the children
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.960]  or more died
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.960]  they count infant mortality
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.960]  and say oh we're living longer
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.960]  but even with those jack numbers
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.960]  infant mortality suddenly
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:06.960]  that did go way down
[01:27:06.960 --> 01:27:08.960]  has gone way up
[01:27:08.960 --> 01:27:10.960]  and so has all the other charts
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:12.960]  so they've got ways to keep us alive
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:14.960]  but
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:16.960]  they're suppressing the real treatments
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:18.960]  I wouldn't call them cures but a lot of border on that
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:20.960]  a cure fixes it every time
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:22.960]  but they've got treatments that are like 95% effective
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.960]  and they do everything
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:26.960]  they can to shut those down folks
[01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.960]  the elite get clean vaccines
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:30.960]  they get real surgeries, they get real treatment
[01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.960]  but you know Paul we're going to cover more
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:34.960]  what's happening in New Hampshire
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.960]  on the situation of Russia and the economy in the next segment
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.960]  but you've been listening to me for 20 minutes here
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:40.960]  ranting about the state of the world
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:42.960]  do you not agree with me
[01:27:42.960 --> 01:27:44.960]  that the political and cultural will
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.960]  of Excalibur
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.960]  to stand up against tyranny
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:50.960]  and to truly promote an economy based on
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:52.960]  exploration, innovation
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:54.960]  and trailblazing, human ingenuity
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:56.960]  will Trump
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:27:58.960]  pun intended the parasitic systems
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:00.960]  of crony capitalism
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:02.960]  well I have that whole palace
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:04.960]  but I mean the problem we've got
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:06.960]  I mean I saw a comment earlier today which was
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:08.960]  you know if extra terrestrials
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:10.960]  invaded earth
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.960]  many on the regressive left
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:14.960]  would help them conquer humanity
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.960]  because there's such this rampant hatred
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:18.960]  for humanity
[01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.960]  oh I totally agree
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.960]  if aliens showed up and said it's for the earth
[01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.960]  the average leftist would throw their child on a garbage disposal
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:26.960]  and literally kiss the butt of the green alien
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:28.960]  yeah so if they said
[01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:30.960]  for the good of the earth we need to put certain people
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.960]  in camps and do this and that
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:34.960]  then they would go along with it
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:36.960]  I mean I'm watching a video of somebody
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.960]  who was viciously beaten up
[01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.960]  by four migrants this professor
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:42.960]  in the UK and he's gone
[01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:44.960]  and come from a Tommy Robinson
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.960]  on his opposition to
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.960]  Islamization throughout Europe
[01:28:48.960 --> 01:28:50.960]  you know we've got people that volunteer
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:52.960]  being raped by these migrants
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:54.960]  in camps and listen I know you're going to cover that
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.960]  in the next hour and I'm glad you are Paul but listen
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.960]  this is it
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:00.960]  I'm not claiming I'm the toughest guy around
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:02.960]  and then Mr. Badass and in either of you
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.960]  but you grew up in a rough area
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:06.960]  with parents in the color
[01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:08.960]  blue collar in Sheffield
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:10.960]  so I've talked to you
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:12.960]  I heard you when you were like 18 years old
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:14.960]  I know you've been through a lot of rough stuff
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.960]  legitimate suffering and not being on the street
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:18.960]  and not living in the real world
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:20.960]  these soft yuppies are the ones
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:22.960]  that love death, love tyranny
[01:29:22.960 --> 01:29:24.960]  love reeducation camps
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.960]  because they've never been around it
[01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:28.960]  so that veneer will peel away very quickly
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:30.960]  as things collapse but yes
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.960]  have you noticed how soft all these would be
[01:29:32.960 --> 01:29:34.960]  have you noticed how unweathered
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.960]  they are how they've never been around
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.960]  Paul?
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.960]  yeah I mean they've set up in dresses to rallies
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:42.960]  it's insane
[01:29:42.960 --> 01:29:44.960]  yeah well if they want to start a physical war
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:46.960]  which we're trying to stop
[01:29:46.960 --> 01:29:48.960]  they'll get a war for us
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.960]  and then we'll find out
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.960]  we're on the march, the empire's on the run
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:30:06.960]  the FBI formally confirmed that its investigation connected to Hillary Clinton's private email server remains ongoing in a letter released Monday
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:10.960]  reports the Hill, the message does not offer any new details about the probe
[01:30:10.960 --> 01:30:12.960]  which the Bureau has been reluctant to discuss
[01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:16.960]  however it represents the FBI's formal notification to the State Department
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:18.960]  that it is investigating the issue
[01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.960]  the letter was sent on February 2nd
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:24.960]  but released on Monday as part of an ongoing lawsuit
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:28.960]  related to the disclosure of Clinton's emails from conservative watchdog judicial watch
[01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:30.960]  FBI Director James Comey
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:32.960]  has previously referenced the FBI probe
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:38.960]  which the Bureau had previously declined to confirm or deny in court filings last year
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:40.960]  key details about the probe remain unclear
[01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:42.960]  such as whether it is tied to a possible criminal case
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:46.960]  or whether it has expanded beyond the initial security review
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:50.960]  Comey has stated that investigators don't give a rip about politics
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:54.960]  and would not be put off by the looming presidential campaign
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:58.960]  you can find more reports on infowars.com
[01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:00.960]  I want more candy, I want more video games, line, line, line
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:02.960]  and it's that type of behavior
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:04.960]  that spurred me to do the research
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.960]  to develop a true nutraceutical formula
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:10.960]  that was designed to smooth out and help children focus
[01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:14.960]  all of our children are hit with modern mind control
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:17.960]  and music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it
[01:31:17.960 --> 01:31:20.960]  young humans have not yet developed their nervous system
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:23.960]  and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions
[01:31:23.960 --> 01:31:26.960]  it's no wonder they can't focus and calm down
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.960]  and then are put on dangerous psychotropic drugs
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.960]  working with my team we set out to find the best formula
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:33.960]  with the highest quality ingredients
[01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:35.960]  that children would actually like and take
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:37.960]  we worked with the leading manufacturer
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.960]  and nutritional supplements that are safe for children
[01:31:39.960 --> 01:31:42.960]  to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.960]  introducing child ease with herbs and calming extracts

[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:32.960]  declaring independence

[01:36:07.960 --> 01:36:10.960]  who are the renegades?
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:15.960]  without you, lord knows where we'll be
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.960]  when it comes to heroes
[01:36:17.960 --> 01:36:20.960]  renegades are mine
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:26.960]  renegades are mine
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:29.960]  think about that double meaning
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:31.960]  when it comes to heroes
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:35.960]  renegades are mine

[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.960]  but I'm teleproportory folks
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:45.960]  on my memory field
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:47.960]  but you think about that
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:50.960]  when it comes to renegades
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:53.960]  when it comes to renegades
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:55.960]  in the world today
[01:36:55.960 --> 01:36:57.960]  who are the renegades?
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:36:59.960]  when it comes to heroes
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:01.960]  renegades are mine
[01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.960]  well, that means we're together
[01:37:03.960 --> 01:37:05.960]  across race
[01:37:05.960 --> 01:37:07.960]  and time and space
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.960]  whether you listen to this in 20 years
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:11.960]  or listen to this today live
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.960]  you want humanity to succeed
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:15.960]  you believe in humanity
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:17.960]  and you know humanity is a force for good
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.960]  when good people take action
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:21.960]  and you know that the evil has taken over
[01:37:21.960 --> 01:37:23.960]  and told us that we're bad
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.960]  so we'll stand down and let them enslave us
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:27.960]  so that's what it comes down to
[01:37:27.960 --> 01:37:29.960]  hey, I know there's a bunch of evils coming
[01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:31.960]  and I'll tell you something
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:33.960]  I'm not that kind of human person
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.960]  when I see some trendy
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:37.960]  pulling up in a brand new Jaguar
[01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:39.960]  and I've seen this
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:41.960]  or a brand new Mercedes wearing a mousy tongue
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:43.960]  hammered sickle
[01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:45.960]  I don't care if I'm with my kids
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.960]  or who I'm with and I believe me
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.960]  I don't want trouble, I don't want to get in their face
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:51.960]  but you know what?
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:53.960]  that symbol flew above the murder
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:55.960]  200 plus million people murdered last century
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.960]  and millions this century
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:37:59.960]  I get in their face
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.960]  and you know the symbol
[01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:03.960]  you have a right to wear that symbol
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:05.960]  but only because you're in a free country
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.960]  that's the symbol of pure death and evil
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:09.960]  and kill five times what the Nazis did
[01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.960]  and I want you to know I am deeply offended
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:13.960]  and you know what their smart butts always say
[01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:15.960]  they say, hey man, free speech
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:17.960]  what are you censoring me?
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:19.960]  it isn't censorship for me to tell you
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.960]  you're a pile of crap
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:23.960]  and when you
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:25.960]  when they open a mousy tongue bar in London
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:27.960]  or in Denver
[01:38:27.960 --> 01:38:29.960]  they say, oh, how will that save the world?
[01:38:29.960 --> 01:38:31.960]  what I mean is when you recognize
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:33.960]  evil naked in your face
[01:38:33.960 --> 01:38:35.960]  basically
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:37.960]  you know what is in your face
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:39.960]  you have got to get in its face
[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:41.960]  this happens to me every once in a while
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.960]  I'm very often but I'll have some liberal
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.960]  socialist, trendy, communist
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:47.960]  but South by Southwest is going on in Austin
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:49.960]  so I'm going to be in a restaurant
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:51.960]  and they'll walk over and go boo, boo, boo
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:53.960]  or tip my drink over
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:55.960]  and I go, hey, have a seat
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.960]  I mean, you're saying boo like I care
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:59.960]  what a crowd of people think about me
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:01.960]  you think I'm that shallow
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:03.960]  one time I was just in a friend of this condo
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.960]  I was in his hot tub
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:07.960]  and this guy walks over and he goes, this girl
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:09.960]  he goes, are you a big looser?
[01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:11.960]  of course he wasn't
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:13.960]  until I was with a con, you were laughing
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:15.960]  we kept doing it for like two minutes
[01:39:15.960 --> 01:39:17.960]  I said, dude, I left junior high a long time ago
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:19.960]  you think you're standing above me
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:21.960]  laughing at me, mean anything to me
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:23.960]  I have an intercompassed punk
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:25.960]  and I want to explain something
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.960]  I'm calling you a punk
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:29.960]  not because
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:31.960]  I want to make you feel bad but because
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:33.960]  you need to know you are a punk
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:35.960]  you're a piece of cowardly
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.960]  filth that thinks that
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:39.960]  I care what you think about me
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:41.960]  you know who I care about?
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:43.960]  I care about what God thinks about me
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:45.960]  and I'm not going to sit here
[01:39:45.960 --> 01:39:47.960]  for you or anybody else
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:49.960]  and sell out my values or what I stand for
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:51.960]  nothing
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:53.960]  will make me bow to you
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.960]  and it's certainly not giggling at me
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.960]  that's the best humor I've heard
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:39:59.960]  in my life but when you realize
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.960]  their mindset you understand
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:03.960]  actually these people are empty
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:05.960]  nothings, they have nothing inside
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:07.960]  so they look at what's reflected back at them
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.960]  as if that
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:11.960]  maintains what's inside of them
[01:40:11.960 --> 01:40:13.960]  they have no idea of the roots
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:15.960]  those of us that love God have into the earth
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:17.960]  into God, into everything, into our ancestors
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.960]  I was thinking about it yesterday
[01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.960]  it's like watching dolphins
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:23.960]  ride up a bow
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:25.960]  of a big shipping container ship coming in
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.960]  there'll be 5, 6, 7, 8 dolphins
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:29.960]  jumping and glee
[01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:31.960]  jumping, riding that wake
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:33.960]  riding that ship going
[01:40:33.960 --> 01:40:35.960]  20 knots
[01:40:35.960 --> 01:40:37.960]  they're caught in it, they love it, it's so fun
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:39.960]  and I can just see
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:41.960]  collectively the archetype of all of our ancestors
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.960]  jumping and
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.960]  leaping on that wake with us
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:47.960]  we're still alive now but they're all right
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:49.960]  a millisecond behind us
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.960]  willing us on to succeed
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.960]  willing us on to create
[01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.960]  willing us on to be strong
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:57.960]  think about that
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:59.960]  and you have that, you think enemy will fall
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:01.960]  in your heart, the minute
[01:41:01.960 --> 01:41:03.960]  the minute you realize all those great people
[01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.960]  that did incredible stuff for us
[01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.960]  they failed, they succeeded
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.960]  they were bad, they were good, they were beautiful
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:11.960]  they were ugly, they were hateful
[01:41:11.960 --> 01:41:13.960]  they were loved, they were everything
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:15.960]  the good, the bad, the ugly but they were real
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:17.960]  it doesn't matter how much high tech
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:19.960]  computer crap that they've got
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:21.960]  it doesn't matter how much brainwashing the enemy's got
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:23.960]  let me tell you the real trump card
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.960]  the ace of spades in this fight
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:27.960]  is our humanity and our destiny
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:29.960]  our collective soul and will that God has created
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:31.960]  he's so powerful
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:33.960]  I don't mean to start preaching here today, it's just the enemy
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:35.960]  is attacking humanity at every front
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:37.960]  and you know how beautiful
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:39.960]  and special and strong you are at every level
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.960]  and don't feel guilty
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.960]  because you have knowledge of evil
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.960]  from the time of Adam and Eve
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.960]  we weren't stupid, we weren't mindless
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:49.960]  we weren't dumb, we weren't even innocent
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:51.960]  we just didn't have dark logic
[01:41:51.960 --> 01:41:53.960]  we didn't have scams, we didn't have con games
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:55.960]  we didn't need to know about con games
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:57.960]  to be able to avoid them
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:59.960]  knowing of a con
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:01.960]  knowing of how evil thinks
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:03.960]  is the beginning of actually being it
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:05.960]  it's being in the mind of it
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:07.960]  so when you have the knowledge of good and evil
[01:42:07.960 --> 01:42:09.960]  it's that you're not evil but you have been
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:11.960]  within evil to understand it because
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:13.960]  you brought up in it and so it doesn't matter
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:15.960]  your pure nature has been destroyed
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:17.960]  it has fallen
[01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:19.960]  but in a
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:21.960]  part of our mind
[01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:23.960]  we are low but in another part we can
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:25.960]  transcend our fallen selves through Christ
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:29.960]  and everything the world has done
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:31.960]  does and everything it's done to try to control us
[01:42:31.960 --> 01:42:33.960]  and that's the true beauty
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:35.960]  now I want to cover some news here and stop preaching
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:37.960]  but I do preach here occasionally
[01:42:37.960 --> 01:42:39.960]  I'm here on the telephone, Paul Watson
[01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:41.960]  in London, England
[01:42:41.960 --> 01:42:43.960]  we have the enforced news center in Austin, Texas
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:45.960]  we have Richard Reeves
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:47.960]  in New Hampshire
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:49.960]  where most polls show Trump 15 to 20 points ahead
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:51.960]  but God knows what they'll end up doing to him tonight
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.960]  whether he's real
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:55.960]  or good or bad, it doesn't matter
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.960]  the fix clearly is in to push Rubio
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:42:59.960]  so much is happening, Paul Watson is covering
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:01.960]  the attempt
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:03.960]  to sacrifice the West
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:05.960]  the attempt to butcher
[01:43:05.960 --> 01:43:07.960]  what is in it, the Renaissance
[01:43:07.960 --> 01:43:09.960]  the literature, the true liberalism
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.960]  of free open culture with the wicked curve
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:13.960]  sword
[01:43:13.960 --> 01:43:15.960]  of ancient radical
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:17.960]  Islam
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:19.960]  now being
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.960]  launched against us in it and people say
[01:43:21.960 --> 01:43:23.960]  it's so bold it's so crazy
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:25.960]  why would they be so obvious
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:27.960]  why would they be so open
[01:43:27.960 --> 01:43:29.960]  why do they cover it up, why do they hate us
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:31.960]  they hate you because your ancestors were strong
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:33.960]  and I don't care
[01:43:33.960 --> 01:43:35.960]  if you were a Comanche
[01:43:35.960 --> 01:43:37.960]  and I don't care if you're from
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:39.960]  Latin America, China, Russia
[01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:41.960]  Africa, whatever
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.960]  in this world there are good people
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:45.960]  and there are bad people and we have free will
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:47.960]  but the reason you're a leader in the bond lines
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:49.960]  is that family lines resonate towards good
[01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:51.960]  or they resonate towards evil
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:53.960]  and the globalists
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:55.960]  are artificially trying to manipulate that
[01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.960]  to turn humanity towards wickedness
[01:43:57.960 --> 01:43:59.960]  right now
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:01.960]  and that's why it's so important that you realize
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:03.960]  you do have power
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:05.960]  we can turn the world around
[01:44:05.960 --> 01:44:07.960]  but you have to understand
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:09.960]  your native potential
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:13.960]  everything that Madison Avenue does
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:15.960]  everything that TV and the culture
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:17.960]  controllers do is about
[01:44:17.960 --> 01:44:19.960]  making you feel small and ugly
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:21.960]  and bad, you are incredible
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:23.960]  on an incredible planet
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:25.960]  around incredible things, you can do so much amazing things
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:27.960]  the fact that the human body can get
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:29.960]  out of bed in the morning
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:31.960]  the fact that we can have children
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:33.960]  in the middle of the sun set
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:35.960]  the fact that we can write music and literature
[01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.960]  and enjoy it and commune together
[01:44:37.960 --> 01:44:39.960]  every second is a moment of high
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:41.960]  magic
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:45.960]  break the enemy
[01:44:45.960 --> 01:44:47.960]  break the enemy's will
[01:44:47.960 --> 01:44:49.960]  break its enslavement
[01:44:49.960 --> 01:44:51.960]  you don't need the world
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.960]  you don't need it to authorize you
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:55.960]  you don't need it to certify you
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:57.960]  you don't need it to fulfill you
[01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:59.960]  you are
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:03.960]  you are life on this planet
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:05.960]  you are the highest expression of that
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:07.960]  and that's why the enemy is so scared right now
[01:45:07.960 --> 01:45:09.960]  Paul Watson I know I'm ranting here
[01:45:09.960 --> 01:45:11.960]  and getting a little bit esoteric
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:13.960]  but comments on the esoteric with us
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:15.960]  what do you think the secret of the universe is
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:17.960]  Paul, where do you think it's all going
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.960]  and what do you think getting into politics
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:21.960]  in the news, we should cover next
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:23.960]  well I mean
[01:45:23.960 --> 01:45:25.960]  the secret to happiness is being a good person
[01:45:25.960 --> 01:45:27.960]  Alex, you mentioned earlier
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:29.960]  the hipsters and the trendies
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:31.960]  locking like good people is more important
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.960]  to them than actually being
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.960]  good people and they've done studies
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:37.960]  which prove this
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:39.960]  poorer conservatives are more generous
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:41.960]  than wealthier liberals
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:43.960]  so literature has regressed
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:45.960]  and left us with a speech all day about
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:47.960]  how humanitarian they are
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:49.960]  how charitable they are
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:51.960]  how much they care about the poorer needy
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:53.960]  if you actually drill down into the figures
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:55.960]  that one organization did recently
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:45:57.960]  conservatives with less money
[01:45:57.960 --> 01:45:59.960]  give more to charity
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.960]  than wealthy liberals
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:03.960]  so it's disproven on the face of it
[01:46:03.960 --> 01:46:05.960]  again for them it's all about
[01:46:05.960 --> 01:46:07.960]  virtue signaling, it's about this superficial
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:09.960]  trendiness
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.960]  to communicate that they're good people
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:13.960]  you scratch slightly below the surface
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:15.960]  it's like a path with a camouflage
[01:46:15.960 --> 01:46:17.960]  well sure I didn't know about the new study
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:19.960]  I remember the Montreal study four years ago
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:21.960]  in England
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:23.960]  in the U.S. and Canada
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:25.960]  a huge university study that found that liberals
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:27.960]  are six times more likely to steal
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:29.960]  and six times more likely to claim
[01:46:29.960 --> 01:46:31.960]  they've given a charity but not do it
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.960]  and conservatives and Christians and libertarians
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:35.960]  libertarians particularly are the most
[01:46:35.960 --> 01:46:37.960]  giving groups there are
[01:46:37.960 --> 01:46:39.960]  but this filth sits there and lectures us
[01:46:39.960 --> 01:46:41.960]  all day about how good they are
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:43.960]  when that monster is big
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.960]  glorious dynamo is full well our job
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:47.960]  is to destroy women and children
[01:46:47.960 --> 01:46:49.960]  and then even Bill Maher to his credit
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:51.960]  even putting out a guarantee that's what it is
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.960]  says why won't you expose Sharia law
[01:46:53.960 --> 01:46:55.960]  and the women and the millions sexually mutilated
[01:46:55.960 --> 01:46:57.960]  she goes how dare you
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:46:59.960]  and changes the subject she's a
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:01.960]  notice she gives the exact tan talking
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:03.960]  points because that filthy
[01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.960]  scum is working with the same globalist
[01:47:05.960 --> 01:47:07.960]  funding radical Islam do you believe
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.960]  it that what a pig she is and I think
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.960]  I do hate her okay she deserves to be hated
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:13.960]  she's an enemy of women she's an enemy
[01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.960]  of humanity I'm sorry
[01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.960]  Paul but I'm sick of glorious dynamo I hate that pig
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:19.960]  well she she's in the tank
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:21.960]  for Hillary Clinton
[01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:23.960]  who paid people hired people
[01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:25.960]  to intimidate Bill Clinton's
[01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:27.960]  rape victims that's right
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:29.960]  feminism is that standing up for women's
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:31.960]  rights it's completely disgusting
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:33.960]  and she openly said oh
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:35.960]  you know to Bill Maher
[01:47:35.960 --> 01:47:37.960]  you're making me defend Islam
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:39.960]  and she willingly did so
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:41.960]  even as they're stoning women to death
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:43.960]  and there's this idea that you know that's
[01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:45.960]  just an extreme minority that
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.960]  there was a man in our closet was he
[01:47:47.960 --> 01:47:49.960]  yesterday they found 7 million more
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:51.960]  and 20 something million a decade
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:53.960]  more sexually mutilated
[01:47:53.960 --> 01:47:55.960]  yeah female genital mutilation
[01:47:55.960 --> 01:47:57.960]  why are you very weirdo
[01:47:57.960 --> 01:47:59.960]  liberal women lecturing us you sacks
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:01.960]  of crap
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:03.960]  I mean why are women following
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:05.960]  these scumbag women
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:07.960]  well it's partly
[01:48:07.960 --> 01:48:09.960]  Stockholm syndrome and it's partly
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:11.960]  you know their whole stick relies on a
[01:48:11.960 --> 01:48:13.960]  constant supply of them being
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:15.960]  able to claim that we live in a patriarchy
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:17.960]  in a misogynistic society
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.960]  which is why they have to stoop so low
[01:48:19.960 --> 01:48:21.960]  to invoke ridiculous things like
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.960]  they sit here bitching in the middle
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.960]  of the new Atlantis in the middle of the renaissance
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.960]  with everything at their feet with
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:29.960]  the greatest men the world's ever seen
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:31.960]  in our faces telling us our trash
[01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.960]  when our mothers loved us this is an attack
[01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:35.960]  on the species it's just that woman's an alien
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.960]  from a thousand light years away she is
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:39.960]  an enemy of the species there is
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.960]  no man there is no woman there is only
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:43.960]  humanity
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.960]  the west is the greatest place ever to
[01:48:45.960 --> 01:48:47.960]  live for women for minorities it's the
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:49.960]  least racist place in the world you know
[01:48:49.960 --> 01:48:51.960]  I've got a friend of a friend who is like
[01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.960]  the daughter of some rich ambassadors
[01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:55.960]  she's from Malaysia
[01:48:55.960 --> 01:48:57.960]  she's a social justice warrior and a feminist
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:59.960]  constantly whining
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:01.960]  about how racist and intolerant the west
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:03.960]  is her brother is gay
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.960]  he can't go back
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:07.960]  to Malaysia he lives in London
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.960]  he can't go back to Malaysia
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:11.960]  because his family would discommunicate him
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:13.960]  he could possibly be killed
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:15.960]  for being gay in that Muslim country
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:17.960]  yet she's whining about how intolerant
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:19.960]  the west is these are the kind
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:21.960]  of people that we face on a regular basis
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:23.960]  total hypocrite
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:25.960]  scum I mean they are the most
[01:49:25.960 --> 01:49:27.960]  intellectually dishonest soft

[01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:33.960]  I'm sick of them
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:35.960]  and they have to invent
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:37.960]  all these sacred cows to bite that up
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.960]  like rape culture which doesn't exist
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:41.960]  in the west now we're importing one
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:43.960]  they're blaming it on white German men
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:45.960]  you know ridiculous things like manspreading
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:47.960]  all this made up crap
[01:49:47.960 --> 01:49:49.960]  to try and impugn the west
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.960]  and white men in general
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.960]  banning mother and father

[01:49:57.960 --> 01:49:59.960]  exactly and then Gloria Steinem
[01:49:59.960 --> 01:50:01.960]  stands up and says oh there are
[01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:03.960]  a lot of people in
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:05.960]  the Middle East that are standing up for feminism
[01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:07.960]  oh no she went further
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:09.960]  she said Muhammad was the original feminist
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:11.960]  oh yeah she said he was a
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:13.960]  women's rights reformist
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.960]  this is the guy who had like
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.960]  200 sexes

[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:29.960]  in the air and says how great it is
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:31.960]  this is a wicked wicked
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:33.960]  why does she love radical Islam or Islam
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:35.960]  why does she love her a death

[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:33.960]  yours truly Alex Jones
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:35.960]  Paul Joseph Watson right on the show
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:37.960]  into the fourth hour
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:39.960]  third hour
[01:54:39.960 --> 01:54:41.960]  by the way think about the fact that he has a gentleman on
[01:54:41.960 --> 01:54:43.960]  who founded a nationalist party
[01:54:43.960 --> 01:54:45.960]  got out of because race scripts got involved
[01:54:45.960 --> 01:54:47.960]  who has literally been banned
[01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:49.960]  from demonstrating and going
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:51.960]  to speeches in the UK
[01:54:51.960 --> 01:54:53.960]  we have been trying to
[01:54:53.960 --> 01:54:55.960]  ban Donald Trump from coming
[01:54:55.960 --> 01:54:57.960]  they've already banned for what four years
[01:54:57.960 --> 01:54:59.960]  Michael Savage
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:01.960]  how is it liberal
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:03.960]  to say because he criticizes radical
[01:55:03.960 --> 01:55:05.960]  Islam that he's banned
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:07.960]  but that's who these people are they're not
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:09.960]  liberals they do not even deserve
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:11.960]  that it's like I don't criticize
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.960]  Rush Limbaugh but he keeps calling environmentalists
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:15.960]  from the time I was in high school
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:17.960]  I've been listening to Rush Limbaugh 25 years
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:19.960]  I was a senior in high school so I've been listening to him
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:21.960]  25 years ago
[01:55:21.960 --> 01:55:23.960]  gosh I believe it was 25 years ago
[01:55:23.960 --> 01:55:25.960]  but it was and he would go these environmentalists
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:27.960]  wackos
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.960]  playing chainsaw noises they're not
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:31.960]  wackos they run the show
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:33.960]  okay let's say they're wackos then wackos kick
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:35.960]  carbine
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:37.960]  they took over the country
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:39.960]  and it's time to start
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:41.960]  being more honest about
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:43.960]  what we're facing what we're dealing with
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:45.960]  this is scientific anti-human takeover
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:47.960]  Putin came out last year and said
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:49.960]  global carbon taxes and global warming
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:51.960]  is a fraud by select corporations
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.960]  it's a military takeover
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:55.960]  of the energy to shut down nation states
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:57.960]  and individual companies individuals
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:55:59.960]  it is a tax on humanity that's basically
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:01.960]  the full Putin speech
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:03.960]  you can look it up I've read it so many times on air
[01:56:03.960 --> 01:56:05.960]  I have it memorized total truth
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:07.960]  now is Putin good or bad
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:09.960]  I don't know that's total truth
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:11.960]  I judge a tree by its fruits
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:13.960]  who said that over and over again
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:15.960]  and you can't just choose
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.960]  to ignore it and choose
[01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:19.960]  to think everything's okay folks and I know you know that
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:21.960]  I'm talking to new listeners
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:23.960]  we're on almost 200 stations across the country
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:25.960]  the show is exploding

[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:29.960]  the real world and separately
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:31.960]  the power of we the people
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:33.960]  spread the word about this broadcast
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:35.960]  other shows like it telling friends and family
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:37.960]  neighbors
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:39.960]  supporting with your dollars
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:41.960]  institutions organizations
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:43.960]  systems that tell the truth
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:45.960]  that's the last real power we have
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:47.960]  is word of mouth and the power of the purse
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:49.960]  voting with our dollar
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:51.960]  and we're running a special through tomorrow

[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:49.960]  I mean communists rob banks
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:51.960]  and run sex slave rings
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:53.960]  to find themselves we just sell products
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:55.960]  how dirty, how unscrupulous

[01:58:13.960 --> 01:58:15.960]  we're going to talk to Tommy Robinson
[01:58:15.960 --> 01:58:17.960]  who of course just spearheaded
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.960]  the Pegida demonstrations in Birmingham
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:21.960]  in the UK and obviously several other
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:23.960]  demonstrations throughout Europe
[01:58:23.960 --> 01:58:25.960]  so we're going to get the latest on that
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:27.960]  how he was censored by Al Jazeera
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:29.960]  for bringing up a certain sensitive topic
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:31.960]  and lots more
[01:58:31.960 --> 01:58:33.960]  I'm going to try and take a couple of callers for Tommy
[01:58:33.960 --> 01:58:35.960]  so that's coming up
[01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:05.960]  we did a super male and a super female vitality
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:07.960]  big changes, a lot of energy
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:09.960]  we've gotten off the cheap energy drinks
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:11.960]  energy shots, a statement, a ton of money there
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:13.960]  sourced from powerful organic
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:15.960]  herbs, harvested around the planet
[01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:17.960]  and then concentrated
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:19.960]  or maximum potency
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:21.960]  they want to stun and dumb down
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:23.960]  and energy drinks and stuff
[01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:25.960]  just cover that up for a while
[01:59:25.960 --> 01:59:27.960]  but then burn you out
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.960]  and then they're like
[01:59:29.960 --> 01:59:31.960]  they're going to be like
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:33.960]  cover that up for a while
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:35.960]  but then burn you out in my experience
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:37.960]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[01:59:37.960 --> 01:59:39.960]  goes right to the source
[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:41.960]  so it's pretty exciting and I love it

[02:00:11.960 --> 02:00:13.960]  the world is a dangerous place
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:15.960]  not because of evil
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:17.960]  but because of those who look on
[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:19.960]  and do nothing
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:21.960]  if you are receiving this transmission
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:23.960]  you are the resistance

[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:27.960]  to the Central Texas Command Center
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:29.960]  it's Alex Jones
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:33.960]  we're all back
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:35.960]  on the Alex Jones show this live Tuesday
[02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:37.960]  February 9th edition
[02:00:37.960 --> 02:00:39.960]  and I'm delighted to be joined by a guest
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:41.960]  who's been on the show before
[02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:43.960]  he's Tommy Robinson
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:45.960]  obviously the founder of the EDL
[02:00:45.960 --> 02:00:47.960]  he left that organization
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:49.960]  now he's an avid speaker
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:51.960]  on the problems in the western world
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:53.960]  with the rise of
[02:00:53.960 --> 02:00:55.960]  Islam, ISIS, hate speech
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:57.960]  and Sharia law
[02:00:57.960 --> 02:00:59.960]  he's been liaising with the Pegida movement
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:01.960]  and he was involved in the protest
[02:01:01.960 --> 02:01:03.960]  this past weekend in Birmingham
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:05.960]  obviously other protests taking place
[02:01:05.960 --> 02:01:07.960]  throughout Europe
[02:01:07.960 --> 02:01:09.960]  his most recent book is
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:11.960]  Enemy of the State
[02:01:11.960 --> 02:01:13.960]  and his website is tommyroppinson.co.uk
[02:01:13.960 --> 02:01:15.960]  Tommy, welcome to the show
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:19.960]  we don't have Tommy yet
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:21.960]  what I want to talk to Tommy about
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:23.960]  when we get him on the show is the fact that
[02:01:23.960 --> 02:01:25.960]  there's this clip that's just come out
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:27.960]  which is on his Twitter page
[02:01:27.960 --> 02:01:29.960]  and he's basically confronted by
[02:01:29.960 --> 02:01:31.960]  a liberal
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:33.960]  who was attacked by Muslim migrants
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:35.960]  quite recently
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:37.960]  who ended this Pegida demonstration
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:39.960]  in Birmingham this past weekend
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:41.960]  and obviously he tried to
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:43.960]  pull the same old trick
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:45.960]  these beliefs, these violent acts
[02:01:45.960 --> 02:01:47.960]  this rape culture
[02:01:47.960 --> 02:01:49.960]  is only believed by a tiny minority
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:51.960]  of Muslims
[02:01:51.960 --> 02:01:53.960]  well if you look at the actual polls
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:55.960]  attitudes of Muslims in the Middle East
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:57.960]  to Sharia law
[02:01:57.960 --> 02:01:59.960]  to killing people
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:01.960]  who tried to leave the faith of Islam
[02:02:01.960 --> 02:02:03.960]  to executing homosexuals
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:05.960]  to stoning rape victims to death
[02:02:05.960 --> 02:02:07.960]  the majority of those people
[02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:09.960]  in those countries
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:11.960]  support those beliefs
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:13.960]  it's not a tiny minority
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:15.960]  these are the general beliefs
[02:02:15.960 --> 02:02:17.960]  of Islam as contained in the Quran
[02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:19.960]  and I've featured the video clips several times
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:21.960]  there's a conference
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:23.960]  it took place I believe in 2013
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:25.960]  in Norway
[02:02:25.960 --> 02:02:27.960]  at which a prominent Islamic speaker
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:29.960]  was addressing an audience
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:31.960]  of about 200 quote
[02:02:31.960 --> 02:02:33.960]  moderate Muslims
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:35.960]  now the point he made
[02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:37.960]  was that these so called extremist beliefs
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:39.960]  under the doctrine of Sharia law
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:41.960]  killing people who leave the faith of Islam
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:43.960]  executing homosexuals
[02:02:43.960 --> 02:02:45.960]  stoning rape victims to death
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:47.960]  female genital mutilation
[02:02:47.960 --> 02:02:49.960]  these beliefs have been
[02:02:49.960 --> 02:02:51.960]  characterised by the media
[02:02:51.960 --> 02:02:53.960]  as only being
[02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:55.960]  believed by extremist Muslims
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:57.960]  he wasn't happy with that definition
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:02:59.960]  he said that these are common beliefs
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:01.960]  shared by all quote
[02:03:01.960 --> 02:03:03.960]  moderate Muslims
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:05.960]  then he canvassed the audience to see
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:07.960]  if they agreed
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:09.960]  that these quote extremist beliefs
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:11.960]  are actually the general beliefs
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:13.960]  of most mainstream Muslims
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:17.960]  almost every single person
[02:03:17.960 --> 02:03:19.960]  in that audience of 200
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:21.960]  predominantly Muslim men
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:23.960]  in fact almost entirely Muslim men
[02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:25.960]  raised their hand
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:27.960]  they agreed that these beliefs
[02:03:27.960 --> 02:03:29.960]  are held by moderate Muslims
[02:03:29.960 --> 02:03:31.960]  so no it's not a
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:33.960]  tiny minority of extremists
[02:03:33.960 --> 02:03:35.960]  this is a regressive
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:37.960]  7th century belief system
[02:03:37.960 --> 02:03:39.960]  that's completely illiberal
[02:03:39.960 --> 02:03:41.960]  and is in need of reform
[02:03:41.960 --> 02:03:43.960]  so why again and again do we see
[02:03:43.960 --> 02:03:45.960]  liberals not only failing
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:47.960]  to stand up against it
[02:03:47.960 --> 02:03:49.960]  but openly embracing it
[02:03:49.960 --> 02:03:51.960]  we saw in Cologne
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:53.960]  feminists handing out
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:03:55.960]  roses to Muslim migrants
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:57.960]  weeks
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:03:59.960]  it's probably about 2 weeks
[02:03:59.960 --> 02:04:01.960]  after the mass molestation
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:03.960]  of women in Cologne
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:05.960]  by Muslim migrants
[02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:07.960]  so it's not enough
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:09.960]  they don't simply just ignore it
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:11.960]  they actually embrace it
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:13.960]  they're embracing the rape culture
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:15.960]  the top feminist group in Cologne
[02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:17.960]  came out the day after
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:19.960]  it was made public
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:21.960]  after the media covered it up several days
[02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:23.960]  and said well the real perpetrators
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:25.960]  in all this rape culture are white German men
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:27.960]  because there are a handful of assaults
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:29.960]  at the annual
[02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:31.960]  Oktoberfest beer festival
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:33.960]  so that means the problem is with white German men
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:35.960]  compare that to
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:37.960]  hundreds and hundreds of assaults in Cologne
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:39.960]  Hamburg, Zurich
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:41.960]  all these are the European cities
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:43.960]  we're going to get into it with
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:45.960]  Tommy Robinson after the break
[02:04:45.960 --> 02:04:47.960]  I'm going to take your calls for him as well
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:49.960]  this is Paul Joseph Watson
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:51.960]  it's the Alex Germshaw Live
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:53.960]  at www.fbiwars.com
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:05:19.960]  The FBI formally confirmed that its investigation connected to Hillary Clinton's private e-mail server remains ongoing in a letter released Monday reports the Hill the message does not offer any new details about the probe which the Bureau has been reluctant to discuss however it represents the FBI's formal notification to the State Department that it is investigating the issue
[02:05:19.960 --> 02:05:29.960]  the letter was sent on February 2nd but released on Monday as part of an ongoing lawsuit related to the disclosure of Clinton's e-mails from conservative watchdog judicial watch
[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:37.960]  FBI Director James Comey has previously referenced the FBI probe which the Bureau had previously declined to confirm or deny in court filings last year
[02:05:37.960 --> 02:05:43.960]  key details about the probe remain unclear such as whether it is tied to a possible criminal case
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:47.960]  or whether it has expanded beyond the initial security review
[02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:54.960]  Comey has stated that investigators don't give a rip about politics and would not be put off by the looming presidential campaign

[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:26.960]  but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war
[02:07:26.960 --> 02:07:32.960]  pathogens added to the food and water and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality
[02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:36.960]  turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death
[02:07:36.960 --> 02:07:42.960]  I personally counter this onslaught with Entroplex the latest product from infowars.com

[02:08:26.960 --> 02:08:31.960]  before I mention before the break, you've got to guess Tommy Robinson
[02:08:31.960 --> 02:08:37.960]  who of course is liaising with the Pagida movement they had a big march in Birmingham this past weekend
[02:08:37.960 --> 02:08:42.960]  his new book is Enemy of the State and you can get that at tommyrobbinson.co.uk
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:45.960]  Tommy, welcome back to the show
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:47.960]  having me back on
[02:08:47.960 --> 02:08:51.960]  do we have Tommy? I don't have his audio
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:52.960]  you got me there?
[02:08:52.960 --> 02:08:56.960]  yeah, I can hear you now, so what I want to discuss first is
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:00.960]  we've seen this alignment between Islamists and the left wing
[02:09:00.960 --> 02:09:03.960]  of course a couple of weeks ago there was footage out of Calais
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:07.960]  which showed these extreme left wing protesters
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:11.960]  not only helping them storm the ferry and try to get to Britain
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:14.960]  but they were actually attacking Calais residents
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:18.960]  on their own property throwing bricks etc
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:23.960]  chanting for these violent rampaging migrants throughout Calais
[02:09:23.960 --> 02:09:26.960]  we've had these Pagida marches this past weekend
[02:09:26.960 --> 02:09:31.960]  they showed up again, the media reported it as clashes
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:35.960]  between Pagida demonstrators and these left wing activists
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:38.960]  so tell us what actually happened in Birmingham
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:42.960]  in Birmingham we were quite fortunate with the way the police planned it
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:46.960]  I was there the whole day, I didn't see any opposition to ourselves
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:50.960]  there was a group of about 60 or 70 young anarchists
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:54.960]  calling themselves Antifa, flying the flag of communism
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:58.960]  which communism really is just like Islam without Allah
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:01.960]  but what we did see in Europe, we saw attacks
[02:10:01.960 --> 02:10:04.960]  and when I went out to Copenhagen recently for a demonstration with Pagida
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:07.960]  there was probably only about 200 of us
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:10.960]  but as we walked through the city from everywhere
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:14.960]  there was such hatred coming at us from these young Antifa activists
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:18.960]  and to myself, to the mindset I made, it didn't really bother me
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:21.960]  it doesn't really bother me, one of them run through the crowd and tried to punch me
[02:10:21.960 --> 02:10:24.960]  but when I turned to one of the women, Ann Marie Waters
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:27.960]  who's a spokesman, who's a deputy leader of Pagida UK
[02:10:27.960 --> 02:10:31.960]  and I asked her what she thought of it all, she said she was terrified
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:33.960]  now that's why they do it
[02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:38.960]  they do it to crush and stamp down and silence and dismantle
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:41.960]  any opposition to the Islamisation of Europe
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:46.960]  we saw in Dublin at the weekend, we saw the Pagidas didn't even have to have their demonstration
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:49.960]  because they come under violent attack
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:52.960]  their leader was hospitalised with a pole
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:54.960]  so these are the tactics that they use
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:58.960]  because Pagida has got so big in residence, it's very hard for them to silence it in that city
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:11:01.960]  but obviously to the new movements, probably up in Europe
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:05.960]  their pure motive and their pure ambition is to silence them and destroy it
[02:11:05.960 --> 02:11:08.960]  before it gets the opportunity to get big enough
[02:11:08.960 --> 02:11:11.960]  that's in Dublin the footage there
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:14.960]  so they tried that very on with the English Defence League
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:18.960]  but then the English Defence League, the problem you get when you have a clash like that
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:22.960]  was once you come under attack, which the English Defence League did very early on
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:27.960]  once you come under violent attack, there's only certain sorts of people that go back out on the streets
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:31.960]  now you want to reach mainstream England, middle England
[02:11:31.960 --> 02:11:34.960]  you can't have a hostility like that on a demonstration
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:39.960]  so we chose specifically in the UK to basically march in the middle of nowhere
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:43.960]  unfortunately it's not safe and it's not free for us to walk through our city centres
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:46.960]  because we will get violently attacked, not just by far left activists
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:50.960]  but obviously every city centre in the UK is now occupied with Muslim youth
[02:11:50.960 --> 02:11:52.960]  so we've come under violent attack
[02:11:52.960 --> 02:11:55.960]  so we chose to demonstrate in the middle of nowhere
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:59.960]  and it was a success because the police managed to keep anyone, any opposition away from us
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:02.960]  we managed to have our own peaceful silent walk
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:06.960]  there's approximately about 600 of us, even though the media reports 200
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:09.960]  but obviously this was the first demonstration
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:13.960]  and a success for us was having a silent and peaceful rally
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:16.960]  to show people what we're about as an organisation
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:18.960]  and I'm not a big sit-off fence
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:21.960]  and we hope that Anna will join us on our next one
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:26.960]  Now, I saw you tweeted probably about an hour ago now
[02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:30.960]  there was a guy who Channel 4 said, confronted you
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:33.960]  this was a guy who had been violently attacked
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:36.960]  in his own home, I believe, by Muslim migrants
[02:12:36.960 --> 02:12:41.960]  and he was basically repeating this point that we debunked over and over again
[02:12:41.960 --> 02:12:44.960]  that these beliefs, these violent intolerant beliefs
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:47.960]  are only held by a tiny minority
[02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:51.960]  Now, I was talking before the break about the footage at the conference in Norway
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:55.960]  where the guy is completely confused as to why the media is characterising
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:12:59.960]  these extremist beliefs as extremists, this Muslim speaker
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:04.960]  because their beliefs are widely held by most, quote, moderate Muslims
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:07.960]  and they all raise their hand in the audience to agree with him
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:12.960]  but we see, from the left again, this alignment with Islamism
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:17.960]  we had feminists in Cologne handing out roses to Muslim migrants
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:19.960]  at the biggest refugee centre there
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:23.960]  just a couple of weeks after the mass molestation of women in Cologne
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:28.960]  we've had volunteers in migrant camps in Germany and Cali
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:32.960]  being raped and then their fellow left-wing agitators
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:36.960]  tell them not to talk about it because it might discredit their cause
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:38.960]  and they call themselves feminists
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:41.960]  and they call themselves, you know, supporters of women's rights
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:44.960]  so why are feminists and the left in general?
[02:13:44.960 --> 02:13:47.960]  So, you know, beholden to defending Islam
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:52.960]  when we know it's the most repressive, intolerant belief system in existence
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:55.960]  why do they still hold to that?
[02:13:55.960 --> 02:13:58.960]  It's very easy to do that, it's very easy
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:01.960]  there's no criticism aimed at you for doing it
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:04.960]  if you do what we do and you tell the truth about Islam
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:06.960]  and you criticize...
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:10.960]  We're going to reconnect with Tommy because his audio was cutting out there
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:14.960]  and basically, you can go and watch the video on his Twitter page
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:17.960]  what I was just talking about, this guy confronts him
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:20.960]  he was literally just beaten up by Muslim migrants
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:22.960]  and he goes to Tommy Robinson and says
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:26.960]  how dare you suggest that there's no positive benefit
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:28.960]  to bringing all these people into the country
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:32.960]  and again, you have to make a distinction in the debate
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:36.960]  yes, skilled immigration is good at a slow pace
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:39.960]  when these people can be integrated into society
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:42.960]  and when they're generally economically prosperous
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:44.960]  and they've got a stake in society
[02:14:44.960 --> 02:14:48.960]  you can't just import 1.1 million people
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:51.960]  within the course of 12 months that Germany has done
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:55.960]  without there being massive cultural and societal problems
[02:14:55.960 --> 02:14:57.960]  which is what we've seen
[02:14:57.960 --> 02:14:59.960]  and this is out of Gateway Pundit
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:02.960]  mother of 10 year old boy raped by migrants says
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:05.960]  she regrets telling children, migrants need our help
[02:15:05.960 --> 02:15:08.960]  now this is a story that we covered yesterday
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:10.960]  a Muslim migrant in Vienna, Austria
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:12.960]  raped a 10 year old boy
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:16.960]  he didn't try to flee, he thought it was perfectly normal behaviour
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:18.960]  he went back to the swimming pool
[02:15:18.960 --> 02:15:21.960]  they actually arrested him when he was in the swimming pool
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:23.960]  because he thought this was just
[02:15:23.960 --> 02:15:27.960]  again, routine behaviour to go around raping 10 year old boys
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:29.960]  because he thought it was justified
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:31.960]  because he was sexually frustrated
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:35.960]  it turns out his mother is an immigrant
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:37.960]  as is the child
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:39.960]  and she initially taught her 10 year old boy
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:41.960]  to be welcoming of these refugees
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:44.960]  well, now the boy's mother is speaking out
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:47.960]  the mother of the boy was raped by an Iraqi migrant
[02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:49.960]  in a swimming pool in Austria
[02:15:49.960 --> 02:15:51.960]  says she regrets teaching her children
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:53.960]  to be welcoming to migrants
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:55.960]  the boy's mother, Dunja, who arrived in Austria
[02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:58.960]  as an immigrant in the 90s from Serbia
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:00.960]  said she had always taught her five children
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:03.960]  to offer the same hospitality to new arrivals
[02:16:03.960 --> 02:16:06.960]  that she had herself received
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:08.960]  so now she's spoken out and said
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:10.960]  look, this is a massive problem
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:12.960]  which is interesting because
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:15.960]  the migrants from Serbia tend to be less radical
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:19.960]  than those coming from places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:22.960]  so now she's speaking out against that
[02:16:22.960 --> 02:16:24.960]  after initially teaching her son
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:26.960]  to be welcoming of the migrants
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:28.960]  and again, we're trying to get Tommy back on the line
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:30.960]  to talk about this
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:32.960]  but here's another story
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:35.960]  out of Germany again, refugees beat soccer players
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:39.960]  with iron rods in the street after tournament
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:42.960]  Germany, a country of 80 million, received over 1 million migrants
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:45.960]  and unvetted refugees in 2015
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:49.960]  Angela Merkel is expecting another million migrants this year
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:53.960]  in five to seven years, migrants will bring in their family members
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:55.960]  and now build reports
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:58.960]  basically these soccer players, they just finished a tournament
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:03.960]  they were chased by 20 dogs from a nearby migrant camp
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:06.960]  and beat with iron rods, basically
[02:17:06.960 --> 02:17:08.960]  complete Malay
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:13.960]  and again, this is part of the cultural enrichment
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:17.960]  you can go over to Canada, this is a story out of the rebel media
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:23.960]  Liberals plan to build refugee camps on seven Canadian military bases
[02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:26.960]  tax payers will fund mosques, Karens
[02:17:26.960 --> 02:17:29.960]  so it's not good enough as in Germany to
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:32.960]  evict Germans from their own homes
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:34.960]  to bring these Muslim migrants in
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:37.960]  to take over gymnasiums, to take over office buildings
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:40.960]  in Berlin to pay
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:44.960]  tax payer expense for 10,000 migrants
[02:17:44.960 --> 02:17:47.960]  to stay in three and four star hotels in Berlin
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:49.960]  10,000 of them
[02:17:49.960 --> 02:17:54.960]  while Berlin's 10,000 homeless population remains on the streets
[02:17:54.960 --> 02:17:59.960]  that's looking about 600 million euros to pay for this
[02:17:59.960 --> 02:18:03.960]  and now the Canadian military has been ordered by Justin Trudeau
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:06.960]  who is a massive social justice warrior of course
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:10.960]  to draft plans to house more than 6,000 Muslim migrants
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:13.960]  on a long-term basis at military bases
[02:18:13.960 --> 02:18:16.960]  according to documents obtained exclusively by the rebel
[02:18:16.960 --> 02:18:19.960]  this sounds almost too ridiculous to be true
[02:18:19.960 --> 02:18:22.960]  but they've got the documents, they're here in the article
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:25.960]  included in the Department of National Defence budgets
[02:18:25.960 --> 02:18:29.960]  hundreds of thousands of dollars set aside for religious support
[02:18:29.960 --> 02:18:32.960]  including the purchase of Muslim Karens prayer mats
[02:18:32.960 --> 02:18:35.960]  and foot washing towels
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:39.960]  all part the diversity that Canada is importing at tax payer expense
[02:18:39.960 --> 02:18:42.960]  the plans also call for the construction of mosques
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:46.960]  or worship centres using tax payer dollars
[02:18:46.960 --> 02:18:48.960]  now this is interesting because
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:51.960]  Canada initially said they were only going to bring in
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:54.960]  women and children from Syria
[02:18:54.960 --> 02:18:58.960]  so actual refugees and not these economic migrants
[02:18:58.960 --> 02:19:00.960]  that have been exploiting that
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:03.960]  and pouring into the west as a result
[02:19:03.960 --> 02:19:06.960]  for a typical migrant family
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:10.960]  it's going to be a $200,000 a year subsidy
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:13.960]  not including Medicare or welfare
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:18.960]  this is in Canada, $200,000 a year at tax payer expense
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:19.960]  for each family
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:22.960]  it's shocking that Canadian Armed Forces personnel
[02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:26.960]  will be ordered to abandon the coalition battle against ISIS
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:29.960]  and return to Canada to become waiters, chauffeurs
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:31.960]  and social workers for Muslim migrants
[02:19:31.960 --> 02:19:36.960]  Canadian Forces bases will be turned into squalid refugee camps
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:39.960]  so they're actually taking the military bases in Canada
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:44.960]  and filling them with these migrants at tax payer expense
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:46.960]  we'll be back after the break
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:48.960]  try to reconnect with Tommy Robinson

[02:21:57.960 --> 02:22:00.960]  chronic inflammation is now known to block your ability to repair
[02:22:00.960 --> 02:22:02.960]  and compromises your immune system
[02:22:02.960 --> 02:22:04.960]  making you more vulnerable to all diseases
[02:22:04.960 --> 02:22:07.960]  since poor diet, injuries or stress are all contributing factors
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:09.960]  many people suffer from inflammation
[02:22:09.960 --> 02:22:12.960]  your body's number one means of neutralizing the inflammation
[02:22:12.960 --> 02:22:14.960]  and the pain that it may be causing is glutathione
[02:22:14.960 --> 02:22:16.960]  glutathione is the body's number one peptide
[02:22:16.960 --> 02:22:19.960]  to neutralize free radicals and thus stop inflammation
[02:22:19.960 --> 02:22:23.960]  hi my name is Jason I'm 44 years old for 10 years I had been suffering
[02:22:23.960 --> 02:22:26.960]  from chronic pain in my abdomen and groin
[02:22:26.960 --> 02:22:28.960]  that radiated down into my feet
[02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:32.960]  after three weeks on one roadway the pain in my feet reduced by 50%
[02:22:32.960 --> 02:22:35.960]  and the overall pain in my body reduced significantly as well
[02:22:35.960 --> 02:22:38.960]  I ran out of one roadway and the pain returned
[02:22:38.960 --> 02:22:41.960]  I got another container and again after three weeks
[02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:44.960]  the pain reduced significantly throughout my body
[02:22:44.960 --> 02:22:47.960]  I'd highly recommend one roadway to anyone dealing with chronic pain
[02:22:47.960 --> 02:22:49.960]  due to inflammation
[02:23:18.960 --> 02:23:21.960]  now he's made predictions like this before
[02:23:21.960 --> 02:23:23.960]  and he was right then too
[02:23:23.960 --> 02:23:26.960]  a few years ago he warned that housing prices would collapse
[02:23:26.960 --> 02:23:27.960]  they did
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:30.960]  before that he warned that dot-com companies would crash
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:31.960]  they did
[02:23:31.960 --> 02:23:33.960]  those who listened had a chance to save themselves
[02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:36.960]  but this has nothing to do with the stock market
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:38.960]  this will affect us all
[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:40.960]  a free video he's released online
[02:23:40.960 --> 02:23:43.960]  details everything you need to know at dollardownfall.com
[02:23:43.960 --> 02:23:45.960]  now maybe you'll disagree
[02:23:45.960 --> 02:23:48.960]  with his conclusions but first you need to watch this video
[02:23:48.960 --> 02:23:50.960]  and see the facts for yourself
[02:23:50.960 --> 02:23:52.960]  just go to dollardownfall.com
[02:23:52.960 --> 02:24:16.960]  just go to dollardownfall.com that's dollardownfall.com
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:24.960]  again still defends them
[02:24:24.960 --> 02:24:27.960]  we've got feminists in Cologne handing out roses
[02:24:27.960 --> 02:24:31.960]  we've got rape victims keeping quiet about their ordeal
[02:24:31.960 --> 02:24:34.960]  so as not to make the migrants look bad
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:36.960]  and we've got this entire industry
[02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:39.960]  which is based around censoring criticism
[02:24:39.960 --> 02:24:42.960]  of what is the most intolerant belief system on the planet
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:46.960]  why have so-called liberals abandoned liberal principles
[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:49.960]  by defending the intolerance of Islam?
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:52.960]  because it's easy to do so
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:53.960]  it's easy
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:24:55.960]  what's not easy is to do what we do
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:24:57.960]  what's not easy is to criticise Islam
[02:24:57.960 --> 02:24:59.960]  and tell the truth about Islam
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:01.960]  because you get violently attacked
[02:25:01.960 --> 02:25:03.960]  you lose your job, you lose your career
[02:25:03.960 --> 02:25:06.960]  and currently the free speech market in the UK
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:08.960]  is governed by the father
[02:25:08.960 --> 02:25:12.960]  and they decide what isn't allowed to be said
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:14.960]  I had an interesting day today
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:16.960]  I spent a day with a German girl
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:19.960]  who is doing her master's
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:21.960]  and she's travelled over to interview me
[02:25:21.960 --> 02:25:24.960]  and she said she was brought up in a very left-wing family
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:27.960]  and she's doing her thesis on Pagida
[02:25:27.960 --> 02:25:30.960]  and she said that everything that Pagida is saying
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:33.960]  she finds her own mother who is very left
[02:25:33.960 --> 02:25:36.960]  she says now her mother is saying it
[02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:40.960]  but she still would never support groups like Pagida
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:43.960]  because of the mainstream media perception of them
[02:25:43.960 --> 02:25:46.960]  so not because of the future, because everything they're saying
[02:25:46.960 --> 02:25:48.960]  mirrors what her own mother
[02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:50.960]  mirrors exactly what she was saying
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:52.960]  she put a refugee centre, a asylum secret
[02:25:52.960 --> 02:25:53.960]  at the end of her road
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:55.960]  and they're now scared, she's scared
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:56.960]  and this was someone that
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:25:59.960]  this was a complete left-wing liberal
[02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:01.960]  who would have been wanting to bring refugees in
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:03.960]  similar to the lady that taught her son
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:05.960]  who was 10 years old
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:07.960]  who's just been anally raped
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:10.960]  in a swimming pool changing group
[02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:14.960]  and his mum also was welcomed to refugees
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:17.960]  and I don't really know what it's going to take
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:20.960]  the things that we've seen already in Europe
[02:26:20.960 --> 02:26:23.960]  do you think the whole of Europe would be exploding
[02:26:23.960 --> 02:26:25.960]  and taken to the streets with the devastation
[02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:27.960]  that they're seeing happening
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:29.960]  and it's like an invading army
[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:32.960]  is coming into your country and raping your women
[02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:34.960]  and the men are just standing there
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:36.960]  and that's most certainly how it looks
[02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:39.960]  within Sweden especially
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:42.960]  but I don't see these problems getting any better
[02:26:42.960 --> 02:26:44.960]  if we look to France
[02:26:44.960 --> 02:26:46.960]  we've just seen at the weekend
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:49.960]  the retired army general
[02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:51.960]  who has been arrested there
[02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:54.960]  he's been arrested for attending an anti-Islam rally
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:57.960]  so there was going to be a rally for Pagida in Calais
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:26:59.960]  now this is France
[02:26:59.960 --> 02:27:01.960]  and this is the thing that we say
[02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:03.960]  the more Islam the less freedom
[02:27:03.960 --> 02:27:05.960]  in France they're still under a state of emergency
[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:07.960]  from the Paris attacks
[02:27:07.960 --> 02:27:10.960]  this is the country that gets the Statue of Liberty to America
[02:27:10.960 --> 02:27:13.960]  this is the country that prides itself on liberty and freedom
[02:27:13.960 --> 02:27:15.960]  and here they are banning
[02:27:15.960 --> 02:27:17.960]  banning their own citizens
[02:27:17.960 --> 02:27:20.960]  from having democratic free assemblies
[02:27:20.960 --> 02:27:22.960]  banning them
[02:27:22.960 --> 02:27:24.960]  they're not allowed to come out on the street
[02:27:24.960 --> 02:27:26.960]  they're not allowed to protest
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:28.960]  so that's how far France has already gone
[02:27:28.960 --> 02:27:30.960]  they've lost their democratic rights
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:32.960]  they've lost their freedom of assembly
[02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:34.960]  and that's just a sign of the future times
[02:27:34.960 --> 02:27:36.960]  where the government will force you
[02:27:36.960 --> 02:27:38.960]  to have a say
[02:27:38.960 --> 02:27:40.960]  the government will take your right to say
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:42.960]  anything away from you as we've just seen in France
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:44.960]  and I don't know
[02:27:44.960 --> 02:27:46.960]  I think there's going to be an acceleration of developments
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:48.960]  this coming year
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:50.960]  across Europe
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:52.960]  and it's not going to be pretty
[02:27:52.960 --> 02:27:54.960]  Well I mean
[02:27:54.960 --> 02:27:56.960]  we've had numerous major army chiefs
[02:27:56.960 --> 02:27:58.960]  and police experts over the past few months
[02:27:58.960 --> 02:28:00.960]  come out and in France
[02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:02.960]  indeed they've got the army
[02:28:02.960 --> 02:28:04.960]  this came out in the telegraph
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:06.960]  of national territory
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:08.960]  because they think these ghetto Muslim communities
[02:28:08.960 --> 02:28:10.960]  you know France is about
[02:28:10.960 --> 02:28:12.960]  what 7% Muslim now
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:14.960]  are going to rise up
[02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:16.960]  are going to be radicalized and armed
[02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:18.960]  and they're going to violently try to take territory
[02:28:18.960 --> 02:28:20.960]  in these major cities in France
[02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:22.960]  we saw it with the Paris riots back in
[02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:24.960]  2005
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:26.960]  but again
[02:28:26.960 --> 02:28:28.960]  the sheer hypocrisy of it
[02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:30.960]  and it is a kind of Stockholm syndrome
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:32.960]  it's like if they align
[02:28:32.960 --> 02:28:34.960]  it's kind of easier to swallow
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:36.960]  they don't have to face up to the problem
[02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:38.960]  so it's kind of a mass Stockholm syndrome
[02:28:38.960 --> 02:28:40.960]  that we see going on with the left
[02:28:40.960 --> 02:28:42.960]  and they also share this grievance culture
[02:28:42.960 --> 02:28:44.960]  with Islamists
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:46.960]  which I think is why they identify
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:48.960]  with Islamists so much
[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:50.960]  these extreme leftists because they hate the West
[02:28:50.960 --> 02:28:52.960]  just like the Islamists
[02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:54.960]  they hate the West
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:56.960]  and they're racist
[02:28:56.960 --> 02:28:58.960]  generally against white people
[02:28:58.960 --> 02:29:00.960]  so they actually share these regressive
[02:29:00.960 --> 02:29:02.960]  anti-Western beliefs
[02:29:02.960 --> 02:29:04.960]  which is why they're aligning
[02:29:04.960 --> 02:29:06.960]  correct?
[02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:08.960]  Yeah they're aligning
[02:29:08.960 --> 02:29:10.960]  basically it's the best option
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:12.960]  but let's not kill ourselves
[02:29:12.960 --> 02:29:14.960]  they despise religion as well
[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:16.960]  so it's like a loose alliance
[02:29:16.960 --> 02:29:18.960]  they're very loose alliance
[02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:20.960]  they're both using each other
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:22.960]  but the left should learn from what happened in Lebanon
[02:29:22.960 --> 02:29:24.960]  that the first people that will be turned up
[02:29:24.960 --> 02:29:26.960]  will be them
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:28.960]  from the business
[02:29:28.960 --> 02:29:30.960]  that they were ever successful
[02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:32.960]  but I think that we should just learn from history
[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:34.960]  that what you just said about the put them
[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:36.960]  in their own community and wishing to
[02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:38.960]  separate their own community
[02:29:38.960 --> 02:29:40.960]  that is exactly what's going to happen
[02:29:40.960 --> 02:29:42.960]  we know it's going to happen
[02:29:42.960 --> 02:29:44.960]  OK we'll be back after the break
[02:29:44.960 --> 02:29:46.960]  with Tommy Robinson going to a couple of your calls as well
[02:29:46.960 --> 02:29:48.960]  this is the Alex Jones show live
[02:29:48.960 --> 02:29:50.960]  Informal.com
[02:29:50.960 --> 02:29:52.960]  We're on the March
[02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:54.960]  The Empires on the Run
[02:29:54.960 --> 02:29:58.960]  If polls are to be believed
[02:29:58.960 --> 02:30:00.960]  Hillary Clinton's once commanding national
[02:30:00.960 --> 02:30:02.960]  lead over Bernie Sanders
[02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:04.960]  appears to have evaporated in a matter of days
[02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:06.960]  pointing to trouble ahead
[02:30:06.960 --> 02:30:08.960]  for the former secretary of state
[02:30:08.960 --> 02:30:10.960]  as voters cast their ballots Tuesday
[02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:12.960]  in Sanders friendly New Hampshire
[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:14.960]  reports Fox News
[02:30:14.960 --> 02:30:16.960]  a recent Reuters poll shows Clinton
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:18.960]  leading Sanders 48 to 45
[02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:20.960]  while state polls are far better indicators
[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:22.960]  going into each individual primary
[02:30:22.960 --> 02:30:24.960]  national polls help gauge
[02:30:24.960 --> 02:30:26.960]  the candidates broader appeal
[02:30:26.960 --> 02:30:28.960]  over the past several months
[02:30:28.960 --> 02:30:30.960]  Clinton has at times led the national polls
[02:30:30.960 --> 02:30:32.960]  by more than 30 points
[02:30:32.960 --> 02:30:34.960]  contributing to her front runner label
[02:30:34.960 --> 02:30:36.960]  even as she has faced tough races
[02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:38.960]  in Iowa and New Hampshire
[02:30:38.960 --> 02:30:40.960]  but Sanders may be heading for a big win
[02:30:40.960 --> 02:30:42.960]  in New Hampshire Tuesday night
[02:30:42.960 --> 02:30:44.960]  if he can hold off Clinton
[02:30:44.960 --> 02:30:46.960]  who has gotten tougher on the Vermont senator
[02:30:46.960 --> 02:30:48.960]  in recent days as her husband Bill Clinton
[02:30:48.960 --> 02:30:50.960]  ratchets up his attacks

[02:31:58.960 --> 02:32:00.960]  our listeners over the past two years
[02:32:00.960 --> 02:32:02.960]  tried X2 nascent iodine
[02:32:02.960 --> 02:32:04.960]  and experienced it for themselves
[02:32:04.960 --> 02:32:06.960]  I basically had my gallbladder out
[02:32:06.960 --> 02:32:08.960]  within the last nine months
[02:32:08.960 --> 02:32:10.960]  needed to get my digestive system

[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:24.960]  I needed the deep talks basically
[02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:26.960]  I started taking X2 first
[02:32:26.960 --> 02:32:28.960]  for about seven days and then I did the deep cleanse
[02:32:28.960 --> 02:32:30.960]  I want to challenge the listeners
[02:32:30.960 --> 02:32:32.960]  who have not tried X2 for yourselves

[02:33:22.960 --> 02:33:24.960]  because the all new pro pure shower filter

[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:28.960]  4 stage shower filter

[02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:32.960]  from shower water including heavy metals
[02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:34.960]  VOCs, pesticides, fluoride chlorine
[02:33:34.960 --> 02:33:36.960]  pharmaceuticals and odors
[02:33:36.960 --> 02:33:38.960]  it's BPA free plastic
[02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:40.960]  easy to install
[02:33:40.960 --> 02:33:42.960]  has a filtration capacity of up to 9 months
[02:33:42.960 --> 02:33:44.960]  and it's important to support us
[02:33:44.960 --> 02:33:46.960]  because we don't get
[02:33:46.960 --> 02:33:48.960]  pharmaceutical dollars in the hundreds of millions
[02:33:48.960 --> 02:33:50.960]  from big corporations
[02:33:50.960 --> 02:33:52.960]  we're not funded by George Soros
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:54.960]  we're funded by you buying the products
[02:33:54.960 --> 02:33:56.960]  which pays for our reporters
[02:33:56.960 --> 02:33:58.960]  to go out in the field and challenge
[02:33:58.960 --> 02:34:00.960]  the mainstream media
[02:34:00.960 --> 02:34:02.960]  and the mainstream media needs to be challenged
[02:34:02.960 --> 02:34:04.960]  on this migrant issue
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:06.960]  because Tommy we've seen this whole
[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:08.960]  thing being characterised
[02:34:08.960 --> 02:34:10.960]  by this overwhelming cover up
[02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:12.960]  the former head of ZDF
[02:34:12.960 --> 02:34:14.960]  the top broadcaster in Germany came out
[02:34:14.960 --> 02:34:16.960]  last week and said we report
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:18.960]  what the government tells us what to report
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:20.960]  to please Merkel
[02:34:20.960 --> 02:34:22.960]  we're not allowed to say anything negative
[02:34:22.960 --> 02:34:24.960]  about the refugees
[02:34:24.960 --> 02:34:26.960]  and we've seen this in other European countries as well
[02:34:26.960 --> 02:34:28.960]  there's this coordinated effort
[02:34:28.960 --> 02:34:30.960]  to cover up this migrant rape scandal
[02:34:30.960 --> 02:34:32.960]  God only knows what
[02:34:32.960 --> 02:34:34.960]  you know hasn't been reported
[02:34:34.960 --> 02:34:36.960]  I'm getting told stuff privately
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:38.960]  which is just as bad if not worse
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:40.960]  but you appeared on Al Jazeera
[02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:42.960]  a couple of days ago I think
[02:34:42.960 --> 02:34:44.960]  and they censored an entire
[02:34:44.960 --> 02:34:46.960]  segment from your interview
[02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:48.960]  tell us what happened
[02:34:48.960 --> 02:34:50.960]  so yeah I was asked on Al Jazeera
[02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:52.960]  and I use that now
[02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:54.960]  when I'm talking to journalists
[02:34:54.960 --> 02:34:56.960]  or doing an interview
[02:34:56.960 --> 02:34:58.960]  I scream it like the people can watch
[02:34:58.960 --> 02:35:00.960]  if I think there could be anything suspect
[02:35:00.960 --> 02:35:02.960]  I spoke to Ali in the view now
[02:35:02.960 --> 02:35:04.960]  when I went on this interview
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:06.960]  his name was Peter Dobby he used to be in the UK
[02:35:06.960 --> 02:35:08.960]  he used to work for the BBC
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:10.960]  he obviously took a big money paycheck
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:12.960]  and gone out to Qatar in Gohar
[02:35:12.960 --> 02:35:14.960]  and he's asking me questions
[02:35:14.960 --> 02:35:16.960]  but what he says is he says
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:18.960]  I've got the Quran in front of me
[02:35:18.960 --> 02:35:20.960]  I'm reading from the Quran
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:22.960]  he said I'm going to read you some chapters now
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:24.960]  from the holy book
[02:35:24.960 --> 02:35:26.960]  and then he reads out some verses about
[02:35:26.960 --> 02:35:28.960]  stoning women for death and men and women for death etc
[02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:30.960]  and he says what's the first thing
[02:35:30.960 --> 02:35:32.960]  you think when you hear it
[02:35:32.960 --> 02:35:34.960]  now I knew straight away
[02:35:34.960 --> 02:35:36.960]  I said you're reading from the Old Testament
[02:35:36.960 --> 02:35:38.960]  but he obviously was trying to trick me
[02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:40.960]  where he must have thought I was stupid
[02:35:40.960 --> 02:35:42.960]  in the Old Testament
[02:35:42.960 --> 02:35:44.960]  what you're even trying to do
[02:35:44.960 --> 02:35:46.960]  and then I asked him if he's read the Quran himself
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:48.960]  so he said yes and I said
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:50.960]  okay you're sitting in Qatar
[02:35:50.960 --> 02:35:52.960]  and bear in mind I know that the punishment
[02:35:52.960 --> 02:35:54.960]  for blasphemy or for insulting the prophet
[02:35:54.960 --> 02:35:56.960]  or even apostasy
[02:35:56.960 --> 02:35:58.960]  is death in Qatar
[02:35:58.960 --> 02:36:00.960]  so I said
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:02.960]  are you allowed to sit there freely
[02:36:02.960 --> 02:36:04.960]  and criticise the prophet Muhammad
[02:36:04.960 --> 02:36:06.960]  and he said yes I am
[02:36:06.960 --> 02:36:08.960]  and then so I continued then
[02:36:08.960 --> 02:36:10.960]  Muhammad murdered 600 people
[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:12.960]  he was a racist
[02:36:12.960 --> 02:36:14.960]  he was a thief
[02:36:14.960 --> 02:36:16.960]  he took a young girl
[02:36:16.960 --> 02:36:18.960]  he was 6 years old and he raped her
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:20.960]  she was 9 called Aisha
[02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:22.960]  and then when it actually went out on TV
[02:36:22.960 --> 02:36:24.960]  everything I said about Muhammad
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:26.960]  was cut out
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:28.960]  so when I sat and watched it
[02:36:28.960 --> 02:36:30.960]  the rest of the show was all completely included
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:32.960]  and I also took the opportunity
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:34.960]  seeing as I was talking to the Arab world
[02:36:34.960 --> 02:36:36.960]  and the Arab leaders
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:38.960]  they don't want their oil money
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:40.960]  or their blood money in our country
[02:36:40.960 --> 02:36:42.960]  because the problem is they are buying their way
[02:36:42.960 --> 02:36:44.960]  through our country
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:46.960]  I was sitting in the building
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:48.960]  I was sitting in the shahad
[02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:50.960]  now the shahad was built
[02:36:50.960 --> 02:36:52.960]  on apartheid rules
[02:36:52.960 --> 02:36:54.960]  they know Israeli companies could go in
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:56.960]  I said I was sitting in there
[02:36:56.960 --> 02:36:58.960]  and I said he's trying to talk to me about immigration
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:00.960]  no one in the Israeli past was allowed
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:02.960]  into the country you're in
[02:37:02.960 --> 02:37:04.960]  I said you're also
[02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:06.960]  one of the people who pay your paycheck
[02:37:06.960 --> 02:37:08.960]  actually fund extremism
[02:37:08.960 --> 02:37:10.960]  and terrorism worldwide
[02:37:10.960 --> 02:37:12.960]  I said here you are
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:14.960]  to get into the building
[02:37:14.960 --> 02:37:16.960]  what surprised me most
[02:37:16.960 --> 02:37:18.960]  was to get into the building of the shahad
[02:37:18.960 --> 02:37:20.960]  I had to go for an airport style
[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:22.960]  security where I had to take my belt off
[02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:24.960]  my shoes off I had to pay everything off
[02:37:24.960 --> 02:37:26.960]  and when I asked why
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:28.960]  they said because of the Paris attacks
[02:37:28.960 --> 02:37:30.960]  I said that the Paris attacks come
[02:37:30.960 --> 02:37:32.960]  from the formation
[02:37:32.960 --> 02:37:34.960]  and Saudi Arabia
[02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:36.960]  are funneling into Europe
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:38.960]  to Islamify
[02:37:38.960 --> 02:37:40.960]  and ramify
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:42.960]  in my country
[02:37:42.960 --> 02:37:44.960]  so
[02:37:44.960 --> 02:37:46.960]  but when it went out
[02:37:46.960 --> 02:37:48.960]  obviously they're getting a lot of black out
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:50.960]  they said yes you can criticize Mohammed
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:52.960]  and then they cut everything instead of Mohammed out
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:54.960]  and we posted
[02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:56.960]  the clip on info wars
[02:37:56.960 --> 02:37:58.960]  people can go and see it probably won't have time to play it now
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:00.960]  but you can see the part where they cut out
[02:38:00.960 --> 02:38:02.960]  the video talking about
[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:04.960]  Mohammed marrying and then raping a 9 year old girl
[02:38:04.960 --> 02:38:06.960]  that's what they didn't want
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:08.960]  their audience to hear because it's all about
[02:38:08.960 --> 02:38:10.960]  media censorship
[02:38:10.960 --> 02:38:12.960]  the Old Testament thing
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:14.960]  he's reading from the Old Testament expecting you to fall
[02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:16.960]  for that
[02:38:16.960 --> 02:38:18.960]  the point is nobody's acting on anything that's in the Old Testament
[02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:20.960]  people aren't beheading people
[02:38:20.960 --> 02:38:22.960]  people aren't throwing gays off buildings
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:24.960]  people aren't carrying out terror attacks
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:26.960]  because of anything they read
[02:38:26.960 --> 02:38:28.960]  in the Old Testament
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:30.960]  they are from stuff they read in the Quran
[02:38:30.960 --> 02:38:32.960]  which is we had the story the other day out of Copenhagen
[02:38:32.960 --> 02:38:34.960]  the police they're hid
[02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:36.960]  for the fact for a year
[02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:38.960]  that the guy who attacked the cultural centre
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:40.960]  during the freedom of speech event
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:42.960]  had a gold-plated Quran
[02:38:42.960 --> 02:38:44.960]  opened bookmarks at the page
[02:38:44.960 --> 02:38:46.960]  where it said kill the disbelievers
[02:38:46.960 --> 02:38:48.960]  they sat on that for a year
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:50.960]  those are the people acting out
[02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:52.960]  not people who read the Old Testament
[02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:54.960]  that's a completely debunked argument
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:38:56.960]  we're going to go to some of these calls now
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:38:58.960]  because we're running out of time for Tommy Robinson
[02:38:58.960 --> 02:39:00.960]  Charles in Ohio
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:02.960]  you're on the air with a question for Tommy
[02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:04.960]  go ahead Charles
[02:39:04.960 --> 02:39:06.960]  hey thanks for taking my call
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:08.960]  I just want to say Mr. Robinson
[02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:10.960]  you're a huge inspiration to me
[02:39:10.960 --> 02:39:12.960]  and I'm just a local guy
[02:39:12.960 --> 02:39:14.960]  and I'm trying to make a difference here
[02:39:14.960 --> 02:39:16.960]  in Ohio
[02:39:16.960 --> 02:39:18.960]  I started a blog site social media accounts
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:20.960]  I'm doing everything I can to get the word out there
[02:39:20.960 --> 02:39:22.960]  and make a difference
[02:39:22.960 --> 02:39:24.960]  my question is what did you do
[02:39:24.960 --> 02:39:26.960]  and what can I do
[02:39:26.960 --> 02:39:28.960]  to be seen and be heard
[02:39:28.960 --> 02:39:30.960]  and make a difference before it's too late
[02:39:30.960 --> 02:39:32.960]  thank you
[02:39:32.960 --> 02:39:34.960]  so what I did
[02:39:34.960 --> 02:39:36.960]  what I did was
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:38.960]  get out on the street
[02:39:38.960 --> 02:39:40.960]  and by getting out on the street
[02:39:40.960 --> 02:39:42.960]  it made it impossible for them to ignore
[02:39:42.960 --> 02:39:44.960]  what I found is that when I left the English
[02:39:44.960 --> 02:39:46.960]  to French League
[02:39:46.960 --> 02:39:48.960]  there was a two-year period there
[02:39:48.960 --> 02:39:50.960]  where they just pretty much started to ignore things again
[02:39:50.960 --> 02:39:52.960]  and they wouldn't talk about them
[02:39:52.960 --> 02:39:54.960]  while they were holding mass demonstrations
[02:39:54.960 --> 02:39:56.960]  across the globe
[02:39:56.960 --> 02:39:58.960]  as far away as Australia
[02:39:58.960 --> 02:40:00.960]  12, 13 countries in Europe
[02:40:00.960 --> 02:40:02.960]  held rallies
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:04.960]  it was a talking point
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:06.960]  it brought the debate into people's faces
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:08.960]  it was on radio stations
[02:40:08.960 --> 02:40:10.960]  it was on the news
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:12.960]  and that's what we need to do
[02:40:12.960 --> 02:40:14.960]  we need to get out there and make sure people know the truth
[02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:16.960]  they need to understand the agenda of Islam
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:18.960]  and one thing that's really shocked me
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:20.960]  is the amount of Muslims
[02:40:20.960 --> 02:40:22.960]  without their own religion
[02:40:22.960 --> 02:40:24.960]  they say yes, I'm a Muslim
[02:40:24.960 --> 02:40:26.960]  and I sat there and told them things about Mohammed
[02:40:26.960 --> 02:40:28.960]  and they said no, did he really do that?
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:30.960]  I said yes, he did
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:32.960]  and I said look, this is what the man done
[02:40:32.960 --> 02:40:34.960]  and I think the biggest stop we have
[02:40:34.960 --> 02:40:36.960]  is to expose the truth about Mohammed
[02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:38.960]  that's what I want to do anyway
[02:40:38.960 --> 02:40:40.960]  is expose the people
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:42.960]  because six, seven years ago in the UK
[02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:44.960]  people were unaware that Mohammed killed anyone
[02:40:44.960 --> 02:40:46.960]  they were unaware that he was a racist
[02:40:46.960 --> 02:40:48.960]  unaware that he tortured people
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:50.960]  Mohammed's time is like Christianity
[02:40:50.960 --> 02:40:52.960]  and Mohammed must have been like Jesus
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:54.960]  but the biggest thing is just getting the truth out there
[02:40:54.960 --> 02:40:56.960]  and sticking to your guns and saying
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:40:58.960]  truth is what you believe in
[02:40:58.960 --> 02:41:00.960]  it would be great to see a mass movement
[02:41:00.960 --> 02:41:02.960]  of people out on the street in America as well
[02:41:02.960 --> 02:41:04.960]  and in Canada
[02:41:04.960 --> 02:41:06.960]  and across the world
[02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:08.960]  and at a unified time
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:10.960]  because by doing it at a unified time
[02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:12.960]  it makes it impossible for the media to ignore
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:14.960]  because it's part of something big
[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:16.960]  but yeah
[02:41:16.960 --> 02:41:18.960]  a couple times ahead in America
[02:41:18.960 --> 02:41:20.960]  you're in a situation
[02:41:20.960 --> 02:41:22.960]  where all those countries are in a situation
[02:41:22.960 --> 02:41:24.960]  where they should be looking and learning
[02:41:24.960 --> 02:41:26.960]  they should be looking at art where we're messed up
[02:41:26.960 --> 02:41:28.960]  and stop
[02:41:28.960 --> 02:41:30.960]  I can't believe in the Republic of Ireland
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:32.960]  that's another country that can actually stop it
[02:41:32.960 --> 02:41:34.960]  you've got the ability to prevent what's happening
[02:41:34.960 --> 02:41:36.960]  but I just don't know if there's the will
[02:41:36.960 --> 02:41:38.960]  of the leadership of the country
[02:41:38.960 --> 02:41:40.960]  to stop it
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:42.960]  OK Charles, thanks for the call
[02:41:42.960 --> 02:41:44.960]  I mean that's what it's about
[02:41:44.960 --> 02:41:46.960]  the narrative that Islam is a religion of peace
[02:41:46.960 --> 02:41:48.960]  and you can do that
[02:41:48.960 --> 02:41:50.960]  by looking at what Muslims actually say
[02:41:50.960 --> 02:41:52.960]  in the Middle East
[02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:54.960]  there was a Pew research poll on Muslim attitudes
[02:41:54.960 --> 02:41:56.960]  in the Middle East
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:41:58.960]  again in most of these countries
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:00.960]  the vast majority of Muslims
[02:42:00.960 --> 02:42:02.960]  support these intolerant beliefs
[02:42:02.960 --> 02:42:04.960]  this is not a tiny minority
[02:42:04.960 --> 02:42:06.960]  and this is not a religion of peace
[02:42:06.960 --> 02:42:08.960]  and we're putting Europe under great threat
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:10.960]  in a security sense
[02:42:10.960 --> 02:42:12.960]  by importing this mass wave
[02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:14.960]  of intolerance
[02:42:14.960 --> 02:42:16.960]  George in Connecticut
[02:42:16.960 --> 02:42:18.960]  you're on the air with Tommy Robinson
[02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:20.960]  Hi Tommy
[02:42:20.960 --> 02:42:22.960]  nice to speak to you
[02:42:22.960 --> 02:42:24.960]  I'm wondering if you happen to know
[02:42:24.960 --> 02:42:26.960]  Lutz Bachmann
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:28.960]  out in Germany
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:30.960]  you've been to many demonstrations
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:32.960]  what are you out in Germany at all?
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:34.960]  I know Lutz here
[02:42:34.960 --> 02:42:36.960]  he may actually be a cousin of mine
[02:42:36.960 --> 02:42:38.960]  I don't know for sure
[02:42:38.960 --> 02:42:40.960]  but I looked up some stuff
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:42.960]  I just find the whole debate
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:44.960]  on this stuff is ridiculous
[02:42:44.960 --> 02:42:46.960]  because you should really bring out
[02:42:46.960 --> 02:42:48.960]  you should try to find some
[02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:50.960]  people who have converted from Islam
[02:42:50.960 --> 02:42:52.960]  there's lots of them
[02:42:52.960 --> 02:42:54.960]  you can find them all over the web
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:56.960]  and if they can bring some of them to speak out
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:42:58.960]  about the religion
[02:42:58.960 --> 02:43:00.960]  and what the real deal is
[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:02.960]  I think you'd hurt a lot of people
[02:43:02.960 --> 02:43:04.960]  because it'd be kind of hard for both Muslims
[02:43:04.960 --> 02:43:06.960]  and these numbskulls
[02:43:06.960 --> 02:43:08.960]  that want to believe that if a peaceful religion
[02:43:08.960 --> 02:43:10.960]  would convert a lot of them
[02:43:10.960 --> 02:43:12.960]  but I used to be
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:14.960]  in with a lot of Muslims when I was in college
[02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:16.960]  because I was into
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:18.960]  understanding all types of religions
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:20.960]  because I lived in Asia and various other places
[02:43:20.960 --> 02:43:22.960]  and I tell you I was in diplomatic circles
[02:43:22.960 --> 02:43:24.960]  because I had some pretty high friends
[02:43:24.960 --> 02:43:26.960]  and when I went to their houses
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:28.960]  some of the security people
[02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:30.960]  would show me their collection
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:32.960]  because I have a German background
[02:43:32.960 --> 02:43:34.960]  their collection of Nazi
[02:43:34.960 --> 02:43:36.960]  books and stuff like that
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:38.960]  and they revered the killing
[02:43:38.960 --> 02:43:40.960]  of Jews and stuff like that
[02:43:40.960 --> 02:43:42.960]  so these people are the real
[02:43:42.960 --> 02:43:44.960]  Muslim Nazis
[02:43:44.960 --> 02:43:46.960]  when people say Islamo-Nazis
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:48.960]  they really are
[02:43:48.960 --> 02:43:50.960]  I'm not to say all of them but at the highest level
[02:43:50.960 --> 02:43:52.960]  that's what their attitude is
[02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:54.960]  I can say that from actually meeting these people
[02:43:54.960 --> 02:43:56.960]  at the highest level and speaking to them
[02:43:56.960 --> 02:43:58.960]  and the way they talk
[02:43:58.960 --> 02:44:00.960]  You can see that by the countries where
[02:44:00.960 --> 02:44:02.960]  mine camps are the best sellers
[02:44:02.960 --> 02:44:04.960]  it's the customary elite
[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:06.960]  Muslims, one of our speakers on Saturday
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:08.960]  at our rally in Birmingham was
[02:44:08.960 --> 02:44:10.960]  an ex-Muslim called Mohammed from Pakistan
[02:44:10.960 --> 02:44:12.960]  and he gave a speech about
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:14.960]  his human rights and the ability
[02:44:14.960 --> 02:44:16.960]  we have 3-4,000 apostates from Islam
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:18.960]  high in the UK
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:20.960]  and there's no charity to help them
[02:44:20.960 --> 02:44:22.960]  there's no charity or government support
[02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:24.960]  to help these people get out of
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:26.960]  what is necessary is a cult
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:28.960]  and also just on the looks back
[02:44:28.960 --> 02:44:30.960]  point
[02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:32.960]  I met them and they were so refreshing
[02:44:32.960 --> 02:44:34.960]  because look
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:36.960]  I have a bit of a checkered history
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:38.960]  but if it wasn't for that checkered history
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:40.960]  or the minds that I had of the youth
[02:44:40.960 --> 02:44:42.960]  growing up I wouldn't have been able to do
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:44.960]  or say the things I'm doing
[02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:46.960]  I'd have run away at the first meeting I had
[02:44:46.960 --> 02:44:48.960]  the first terrorist threat
[02:44:48.960 --> 02:44:50.960]  the first time the police come to my house
[02:44:50.960 --> 02:44:52.960]  and tell my wife that my wife and me
[02:44:52.960 --> 02:44:54.960]  the terrorist wanted to kill us
[02:44:54.960 --> 02:44:56.960]  we would have stopped
[02:44:56.960 --> 02:44:58.960]  so I know full well
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:00.960]  that that organisation and those leaders
[02:45:00.960 --> 02:45:02.960]  are not going to stop
[02:45:02.960 --> 02:45:04.960]  because it takes a certain sort of character
[02:45:04.960 --> 02:45:06.960]  and looks to that character
[02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:08.960]  that's why I think I have an admiration
[02:45:08.960 --> 02:45:10.960]  of him and Vicky and the people behind the team
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:12.960]  in Germany
[02:45:12.960 --> 02:45:14.960]  and they're as far away from Nazi's
[02:45:14.960 --> 02:45:16.960]  as you can get
[02:45:16.960 --> 02:45:18.960]  that's why this whole mainstream media
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:20.960]  perception of people
[02:45:20.960 --> 02:45:22.960]  and what that actually does
[02:45:22.960 --> 02:45:24.960]  the image and it's all done
[02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:26.960]  to try and stop support
[02:45:26.960 --> 02:45:28.960]  it's done for people
[02:45:28.960 --> 02:45:30.960]  now it is now
[02:45:30.960 --> 02:45:32.960]  and hopefully
[02:45:32.960 --> 02:45:34.960]  hopefully you're right
[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:36.960]  especially the way you think you're right
[02:45:36.960 --> 02:45:38.960]  and we just need to get Western you're right
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:40.960]  okay George thanks for the call
[02:45:40.960 --> 02:45:42.960]  yeah just picking up on that Tommy
[02:45:42.960 --> 02:45:44.960]  on the Nazi issue
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:46.960]  they tried to demonise you
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:48.960]  from what I read a few days ago
[02:45:48.960 --> 02:45:50.960]  Pegida's actually taking steps now to
[02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:52.960]  expunge these extremist
[02:45:52.960 --> 02:45:54.960]  elements from their ranks
[02:45:54.960 --> 02:45:56.960]  that are trying to glom onto it
[02:45:56.960 --> 02:45:58.960]  and they've got a guy with a neo-Nazi
[02:45:58.960 --> 02:46:00.960]  tattoo who you basically
[02:46:00.960 --> 02:46:02.960]  banned from attending the demonstration
[02:46:02.960 --> 02:46:04.960]  tell us about that process
[02:46:04.960 --> 02:46:06.960]  of filtering out these actual extremists
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:08.960]  well I don't think
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:10.960]  in Germany they have that
[02:46:10.960 --> 02:46:12.960]  from any of the demonstrations I've seen out there
[02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:14.960]  they are mainstream
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:16.960]  they've got ordinary mainstream old people
[02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:18.960]  young people families come in
[02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:20.960]  they've got a complete mixture
[02:46:20.960 --> 02:46:22.960]  of the public
[02:46:22.960 --> 02:46:24.960]  when I went on Saturday I made it very clear
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:26.960]  on this issue
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:28.960]  we're opposed to Islam
[02:46:28.960 --> 02:46:30.960]  nothing to do with colour of skin
[02:46:30.960 --> 02:46:32.960]  nothing to do with race
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:34.960]  no I turned up on Saturday
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:36.960]  and I walked into a hotel
[02:46:36.960 --> 02:46:38.960]  just in the morning and there was a man and lady there
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:40.960]  they started talking to me
[02:46:40.960 --> 02:46:42.960]  they said they were there for a photo
[02:46:42.960 --> 02:46:44.960]  I looked down at the man's hand
[02:46:44.960 --> 02:46:46.960]  and he had a swastika sign
[02:46:46.960 --> 02:46:48.960]  on his hand tattooed
[02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:50.960]  and then I looked at his face
[02:46:50.960 --> 02:46:52.960]  his whole face was a tattoo
[02:46:52.960 --> 02:46:54.960]  and then he had an eye under his eye
[02:46:54.960 --> 02:46:56.960]  and then he had a star bang
[02:46:56.960 --> 02:46:58.960]  on his forehead with evil
[02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:00.960]  and I just said
[02:47:00.960 --> 02:47:02.960]  you're not coming to a protest
[02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:04.960]  you're not coming to a demonstration
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:06.960]  and I said there's a 0% chance
[02:47:06.960 --> 02:47:08.960]  I'm being seen anywhere with you
[02:47:08.960 --> 02:47:10.960]  or you're walking on our demonstration with us
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:12.960]  and then he got up and I said
[02:47:12.960 --> 02:47:14.960]  you need to leave and he did leave
[02:47:14.960 --> 02:47:16.960]  and now I'm getting a bat not a backlash
[02:47:16.960 --> 02:47:18.960]  I'm getting people messing with me saying
[02:47:18.960 --> 02:47:20.960]  why did you keep this bloat out
[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:22.960]  so it's different than many of them
[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:24.960]  but the real far right despised me
[02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:26.960]  I'm seen as a Zionist
[02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:28.960]  and a race traitor
[02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:30.960]  and I said look
[02:47:30.960 --> 02:47:32.960]  simply for sticking to my morals
[02:47:32.960 --> 02:47:34.960]  my morals are that
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:36.960]  to win this battle anyway in the UK
[02:47:36.960 --> 02:47:38.960]  we need every community on board
[02:47:38.960 --> 02:47:40.960]  and I have a problem with
[02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:42.960]  even when it comes to immigration
[02:47:42.960 --> 02:47:44.960]  I don't have a problem with immigration per se
[02:47:44.960 --> 02:47:46.960]  I have a problem with Islamic immigration
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:48.960]  most of the people I know are sons of immigrants
[02:47:48.960 --> 02:47:50.960]  in the UK
[02:47:50.960 --> 02:47:52.960]  my problem comes from the fact that
[02:47:52.960 --> 02:47:54.960]  most of those other immigrants
[02:47:54.960 --> 02:47:56.960]  or European immigrants that would come
[02:47:56.960 --> 02:47:58.960]  are culturally and ethically and morally the same as us
[02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:00.960]  that's a very very different situation
[02:48:00.960 --> 02:48:02.960]  with the Muslim immigrants
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:04.960]  as you've said you said about the Q research
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:06.960]  I believe by 86% of Pakistanis
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:08.960]  think that apostasy should be punishable by death
[02:48:08.960 --> 02:48:10.960]  that's backward
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:12.960]  that's backward and it's not what we want
[02:48:12.960 --> 02:48:14.960]  in this country and because of that mindset
[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:16.960]  that's why Mohammed
[02:48:16.960 --> 02:48:18.960]  that's why our first speaker on Saturday
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:20.960]  has been living in hiding
[02:48:20.960 --> 02:48:22.960]  in the UK for 20 years
[02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:24.960]  living in hiding
[02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:26.960]  I've met quite a few apostates
[02:48:26.960 --> 02:48:28.960]  who are living in hiding because they fear their families
[02:48:28.960 --> 02:48:30.960]  their mums, their dads will kill them
[02:48:30.960 --> 02:48:32.960]  Islam is a religion of peace Tommy
[02:48:32.960 --> 02:48:34.960]  how could they possibly think that
[02:48:34.960 --> 02:48:36.960]  that's it but that is what we're
[02:48:36.960 --> 02:48:38.960]  important and as soon as people see that
[02:48:38.960 --> 02:48:40.960]  you are right and it's valuable that we hear
[02:48:40.960 --> 02:48:42.960]  from ex-Muslims which is why hopefully
[02:48:42.960 --> 02:48:44.960]  Mohammed now
[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:46.960]  in the UK
[02:48:46.960 --> 02:48:48.960]  will play a leading role in that
[02:48:48.960 --> 02:48:50.960]  because he stood up on stage and in his speech
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:52.960]  he said you keep calling Tommy a racist
[02:48:52.960 --> 02:48:54.960]  you keep calling
[02:48:54.960 --> 02:48:56.960]  a racist and he said what are you going to call me
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:48:58.960]  what are you going to call me
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:49:00.960]  I'm from Pakistan and he also
[02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:02.960]  bought his Pakistan flag which to be honest
[02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:04.960]  the symbolism
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:06.960]  of what that flag represents for me
[02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:08.960]  I don't like it because of all the
[02:49:08.960 --> 02:49:10.960]  Pakistani grooming gangs because of Pakistan as a country
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:12.960]  because of the blasphemy laws because of all these things
[02:49:12.960 --> 02:49:14.960]  but I'm not going to tell him he can't bring his flag
[02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:16.960]  but he held his flag
[02:49:16.960 --> 02:49:18.960]  because there's millions of Christians in Pakistan
[02:49:18.960 --> 02:49:20.960]  who are persecuted, who are targeted
[02:49:20.960 --> 02:49:22.960]  but when he stood up he said
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:24.960]  this is the flag of my heritage, this is where I'm from
[02:49:24.960 --> 02:49:26.960]  he said but from British first
[02:49:26.960 --> 02:49:28.960]  Pakistani second and also
[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:30.960]  I had a lot of people trying to give me a bit of flag
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:32.960]  because he had his country's flag there
[02:49:32.960 --> 02:49:34.960]  he was standing up on stage
[02:49:34.960 --> 02:49:36.960]  but his life in danger
[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:38.960]  but openly calling on
[02:49:38.960 --> 02:49:40.960]  with his arm in the UK
[02:49:40.960 --> 02:49:42.960]  and he wants to buy his own country's flag
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:44.960]  but I'm not going to tell him he can't
[02:49:44.960 --> 02:49:46.960]  but yeah, we have
[02:49:46.960 --> 02:49:48.960]  so much to do
[02:49:48.960 --> 02:49:50.960]  so many problems
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:52.960]  and what we have to remember of course is that
[02:49:52.960 --> 02:49:54.960]  many ex-Muslims and indeed
[02:49:54.960 --> 02:49:56.960]  current Muslims stand up against this intolerance
[02:49:56.960 --> 02:49:58.960]  and there they
[02:49:58.960 --> 02:50:00.960]  become the immediate targets of the regressive left
[02:50:00.960 --> 02:50:02.960]  we had a report put out
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:04.960]  by a left wing group a few weeks ago
[02:50:04.960 --> 02:50:06.960]  called Hope Not Hate
[02:50:06.960 --> 02:50:08.960]  they had a list of quote
[02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:10.960]  anti-Muslim bigots
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:12.960]  one of the people included on that list
[02:50:12.960 --> 02:50:14.960]  was a devout Muslim woman
[02:50:14.960 --> 02:50:16.960]  who campaigns against
[02:50:16.960 --> 02:50:18.960]  honour killing
[02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:20.960]  she was put on a list of anti-Muslim bigots
[02:50:20.960 --> 02:50:22.960]  so again, the regressive left
[02:50:22.960 --> 02:50:24.960]  has aligned with Islamists
[02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:26.960]  to the point where they now
[02:50:26.960 --> 02:50:28.960]  attack constantly people like
[02:50:28.960 --> 02:50:30.960]  you know, Ayyan Hursiyali, people like
[02:50:30.960 --> 02:50:32.960]  Majid Nawaz who are standing up
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:34.960]  for the true reformation of Islam
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:36.960]  those people are the ideological bedfellows
[02:50:36.960 --> 02:50:38.960]  of Islamists
[02:50:38.960 --> 02:50:40.960]  and they're part of the problem
[02:50:40.960 --> 02:50:42.960]  which is why we need to keep calling them out
[02:50:42.960 --> 02:50:44.960]  we'll be back with the final segment
[02:50:44.960 --> 02:50:46.960]  with Tommy Robinson
[02:50:46.960 --> 02:50:48.960]  we've got David Knight coming up in the fourth hour
[02:50:48.960 --> 02:50:50.960]  breaking news at infowars.com

[02:53:58.560 --> 02:54:14.560]  top story upon info wars dot com twitter
[02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:20.000]  announces partnership with islamist feminist terrestrial free speech twitter is organizing
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:25.360]  a trust and safety council with islamist and feminist because of course they're the
[02:54:25.360 --> 02:54:31.360]  perfect source to go to for free speech control to prevent abuse harassment and bullying which
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:37.600]  critics point out will lead to mass censorship on twitter they've already suspended the account of
[02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:45.840]  yet another prominent critic of islam christina lila saudi arabia is twitter's second biggest
[02:54:45.840 --> 02:54:52.480]  shareholder i wonder if they've had any influence now as twitter moves towards outright censorship
[02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:58.880]  their stock is tanking top executives within twitter are leaving the company and yet they
[02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:05.120]  still continue to march forward with these authoritarian censorious policies aided by
[02:55:06.080 --> 02:55:12.880]  that again that magic duo of islamists and feminists who are aligned because they both hate free
[02:55:12.880 --> 02:55:18.480]  speech but tommy we got a few minutes left here just summing up we've got all these top security
[02:55:18.480 --> 02:55:24.560]  experts throughout europe warning that if this mass immigration madness is not reversed we're
[02:55:24.560 --> 02:55:31.600]  going to see civil unrest maybe even war tell people where you think it's heading and then in
[02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:37.040]  summary uh how they can support you and get the book um that's exactly where it is heading
[02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:42.000]  unfortunately unless we see in the next coming year a mass mass movement of people putting
[02:55:42.000 --> 02:55:45.840]  immense pressure because there's nothing our political leaders fear more than the mass movement
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:50.320]  of people that's what we need to see and just while you was on that about the left wing group
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:56.240]  that was hope not hate who who made that report um calling moderate muslims anti muslim figures
[02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:59.360]  you have to look at where their funding comes from that which funding comes from open door
[02:55:59.360 --> 02:56:05.040]  open border policy groups in the united states as well so and i've met the leader of there and he
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:08.080]  doesn't actually believe what he's what what he's writing but a lot of these people are doing it
[02:56:08.080 --> 02:56:12.320]  for an agenda and for a career path because there's there's so much money on the left
[02:56:12.320 --> 02:56:17.920]  but um people can get behind and support us just by joining there is an anti islamistic group in
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:21.760]  every country pretty much now and we're trying to coordinate them we're trying to bring them all
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:26.560]  together under one banner so on certain times of the year i believe the next day will be sometime
[02:56:26.560 --> 02:56:31.200]  now in may and then when that date comes in may we'll take to the streets in the uk and germany
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:36.160]  and holland and in australia we hope that people in in america join on the people in canada join on
[02:56:36.160 --> 02:56:40.080]  and they're across the globe at the same moment at the same time people are showing a
[02:56:40.080 --> 02:56:44.720]  solidarian union with each other and showing some sort of resistance to what what's being
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:49.120]  forced upon our country because that's what it is it's being forced upon us and um and then with
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:53.680]  regards to the book here the book the book is just basically my story it's called enemy of the state
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:57:00.400]  and it's the worrying story of the of the fact that the the length of state will go to just how
[02:57:00.400 --> 02:57:05.760]  much influence islam has already the length they'll go to to silence and stop and disrupt
[02:57:05.760 --> 02:57:12.000]  any criticism of itself because i'm in court again tomorrow i'm in court against tomorrow it's
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:16.880]  just it's never ending and and that's and that's to tie you down and stop you and swamp you're so
[02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:24.880]  much that you're just drowning in in uh in in problems of the state so you don't have any energy
[02:57:24.880 --> 02:57:31.520]  or time to to tackle what what's happening to the country but yeah that's basically it and you can
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:36.960]  get on tommy robinson don't go to uk or you can get on kindle in america kindle kindle in most
[02:57:36.960 --> 02:57:43.600]  countries so okay that's going to wrap it up tommy we'll be sure to have you back on as this unfolds

[02:57:59.920 --> 02:58:04.160]  over to europe because they'll culturally enrich you it's so positive and beneficial
[02:58:04.720 --> 02:58:10.800]  after freeing aleppo syrian army russian aircraft could focus on raka um people like marco rubio
[02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:17.360]  aren't happy about that because the jihadist rebels that we armed and funded are failing in syria
[02:58:17.360 --> 02:58:22.720]  we've also got twitter's attempt to silence generation trump they're on an outright authoritarian

[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:28.320]  hampshire primary of course we've already had some voting began the small towns in new hampshire
[03:00:28.320 --> 03:00:34.320]  are allowed to vote those that have less than 100 people can start voting at midnight and they can
[03:00:34.320 --> 03:00:39.360]  report the results once everybody in the town has voted so we have some results in there but we're
[03:00:39.360 --> 03:00:44.240]  going to talk about the real results you know what is happening now with the first voting
[03:00:44.240 --> 03:00:50.960]  that's not really the first voting the first voting was done way way back last year sometime
[03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:55.920]  if you look at the super delegates we're going to break this down in detail hillary clinton
[03:00:55.920 --> 03:01:02.320]  using super delegates and we'll tell you what that is already has 15 percent of the delegates
[03:01:02.320 --> 03:01:08.240]  she needs to win the nomination and that's before any of the voting begins we're going to talk to
[03:01:08.240 --> 03:01:13.360]  you about what's going on there break down some of the early results in new hampshire of course
[03:01:13.360 --> 03:01:18.400]  tonight we're going to have live coverage of the trump watch party in new hampshire that's going
[03:01:18.400 --> 03:01:24.000]  to be beginning at six p.m. central seven p.m. eastern that's going to be on the alex jones
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:29.360]  live you stream channel and then we'll be joining an hour later with live coverage with our info
[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:33.600]  wars nightly news crew with the at the typical time we do the nightly news that'll be at seven
[03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:38.880]  central eight p.m. eastern by that time we should have a lot of results to take a look at and of
[03:01:38.880 --> 03:01:44.640]  course the big fight is on for second place all the polls are saying that donald trump
[03:01:44.640 --> 03:01:49.040]  is far ahead in terms of first place in new hampshire the interesting thing is going to be
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:54.720]  that some of these people who are fighting for second place and some of these lower tier
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:02:01.600]  candidates who get less than 10 percent their votes are going to be turned over to the winner
[03:02:01.600 --> 03:02:06.800]  which would be donald trump so he's going to pick up not only the delegates on his side but
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:10.320]  he's going to pick up the delegates for those who get less than 10 percent of course that won't
[03:02:10.320 --> 03:02:15.360]  be an issue on the democrat side since there's only two candidates and the super delegate
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:21.040]  issue on the republican side is not really that big there's five times the number of super delegates
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:24.880]  in the democrat party then there is in the republican party you can see the effect of
[03:02:24.880 --> 03:02:29.440]  how that is working i mean we've all looked at what debbie wassenman schultz the head of the dnc
[03:02:29.440 --> 03:02:34.640]  has done as a gift to hillary clinton in terms of the way she scheduled the debates putting them
[03:02:34.640 --> 03:02:39.920]  on the last saturday before christmas uh putting them in the middle of the nfl playoffs
[03:02:39.920 --> 03:02:45.840]  most of them falling on the weekend uh came in for a lot of criticism from bernie sanders
[03:02:45.840 --> 03:02:50.320]  other people who said hey we would like to see a back and forth discussion between these candidates
[03:02:50.320 --> 03:02:54.640]  which is exactly what hillary clinton didn't want to have but as she started to come off better in
[03:02:54.640 --> 03:02:59.520]  the debates and she had originally planned they have now added uh some additional debates
[03:02:59.520 --> 03:03:05.840]  uh between now and march so we'll see what happens with that but it just shows one of the aspects
[03:03:05.840 --> 03:03:12.720]  the way they rig this whole process now we've got an article up on info wars dot com the creator of
[03:03:12.720 --> 03:03:18.000]  dillbert predicts that the gop will rig new hampshire scott adams the creator of the popular
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:23.040]  dillbert cartoon series predicts that the gop will rig tonight's primary in new hampshire as a favor
[03:03:23.040 --> 03:03:28.880]  to establishment favorite marco rubio and it's interesting because after this horrible debate
[03:03:28.880 --> 03:03:35.360]  that uh marco robado had on saturday most of the polls are showing him dropping out a second place
[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:40.880]  to third many of them showing him in fourth place some of them right at the threshold of 10 percent
[03:03:41.520 --> 03:03:46.320]  and so uh it would be interesting to uh see if his prediction comes true we'll talk about that
[03:03:46.320 --> 03:03:51.120]  in a little bit more detail we also have some stories about driverless cars there was a drudge
[03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:58.480]  report article why driverless cars will screech to a halt it was an op-ed piece by steven hill
[03:03:58.480 --> 03:04:04.560]  he believes that liability and regulatory issues are going to bring that to a halt i'm i wish i could
[03:04:04.560 --> 03:04:10.160]  agree with him i wish i could agree with him that uh letting a 3000 pound death machine
[03:04:10.160 --> 03:04:16.880]  steer itself with no human at the controls is a huge problem i agree with that i just don't think
[03:04:16.880 --> 03:04:22.160]  that the current uh system that we have you're going to have a problem with the insurance
[03:04:22.160 --> 03:04:26.640]  companies and the government with liability and with regulatory issues i believe they're the ones
[03:04:26.640 --> 03:04:32.880]  who are pushing for this the hardest i think the insurance companies as well as a couple of well
[03:04:32.880 --> 03:04:38.800]  connected crony capitalist organizations like uber and even the automobile companies themselves
[03:04:38.800 --> 03:04:44.880]  ford is now not calling itself necessarily a car company in the future they're calling themselves
[03:04:44.880 --> 03:04:50.320]  a transportation company in other words they think they can make alliances with the government and
[03:04:50.320 --> 03:04:57.520]  push their driverless cars stay with us we'll be right back with all that news and more
[03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:04.480]  the fbi formally confirmed that its investigation connected to hillary clinton's private email server
[03:05:04.480 --> 03:05:09.760]  remains ongoing in a letter released monday reports the hill the message does not offer any new

[03:08:00.080 --> 03:08:03.440]  and let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that barack obama doesn't know what
[03:08:03.440 --> 03:08:17.440]  he's doing he knows exactly what he's doing but i would add this let's dispel with this fiction
[03:08:17.440 --> 03:08:21.920]  that barack obama doesn't know what he's doing he knows exactly what he's doing back here's the
[03:08:21.920 --> 03:08:26.080]  bottom line this notion that barack obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not there it is he
[03:08:26.080 --> 03:08:30.880]  knows exactly what the memorize 25 seconds speak well that's the that's the reason why the campaign
[03:08:30.880 --> 03:08:36.080]  is so fortunate to the gang of a bill first well here's the response if i think anyone who believes
[03:08:36.080 --> 03:08:39.680]  that barack obama isn't doing what he's doing on purpose doesn't understand what we're dealing with
[03:08:39.680 --> 03:08:50.240]  here okay this is a president this is a president who's trying to change this country find out more
[03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:57.760]  about the robotic politicians that went to enslave you at info wars dot com i love what
[03:08:57.760 --> 03:09:03.280]  walker did with that sticks song uh mr. roboto that's actually a marco roboto and you have to
[03:09:03.280 --> 03:09:07.840]  see that we'll play that again tonight with our live coverage that'll begin actually at
[03:09:07.840 --> 03:09:12.400]  six p.m. central we're going to be live streaming from the trump watch party in new hampshire with
[03:09:12.400 --> 03:09:16.960]  our info wars crew on the ground there richard reeves and others they'll be live streaming that
[03:09:16.960 --> 03:09:21.760]  on you stream the alex jones live channel then we will begin with our nightly news coverage tonight
[03:09:21.760 --> 03:09:26.160]  at seven central eight p.m. eastern but again the live coverage of the watch party will start
[03:09:26.160 --> 03:09:31.120]  about an hour earlier they're going to uh have results i think a lot earlier than we saw with
[03:09:31.120 --> 03:09:35.120]  the iowa caucus of course that was in the central time zone it started an hour later now we're going
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:40.560]  to have the polls closing in new hampshire an hour earlier than they closed in iowa and of course it
[03:09:40.560 --> 03:09:46.240]  is a uh an eastern time zone so we should have a lot of results as we began the program but going
[03:09:46.240 --> 03:09:52.480]  back to that song mr. roboto is an absolute perfect fit to what we saw with marco rubio if you listen
[03:09:52.480 --> 03:09:56.880]  to the lyrics if you're not familiar with the song of course it's probably 35 years since that song
[03:09:56.880 --> 03:10:05.280]  came out domo arigato marco roboto okay that's japanese for thank you very much okay why would
[03:10:05.280 --> 03:10:11.280]  they be thanking him so much well you know he's a big proponent of the trans specific partnership
[03:10:11.280 --> 03:10:16.160]  and you know as i go on with the song we played the song it's secret secret i've got a secret you
[03:10:16.160 --> 03:10:23.280]  know it's a secret trade agreement is he uh man or mannequin we don't know okay but uh he certainly
[03:10:23.280 --> 03:10:28.320]  supports that trade agreement and as i mentioned yesterday the the brickings institute pointed
[03:10:28.320 --> 03:10:33.680]  out that donald trump has been opposing these kinds of trade agreements as being bad deals going back
[03:10:33.680 --> 03:10:39.920]  30 years there's another article uh from fusion that pointed out when he went on the oprah wimphrey
[03:10:39.920 --> 03:10:45.360]  show back in 1988 he was promoting his book the art of the deal and it turned to politics because
[03:10:45.360 --> 03:10:51.200]  he'd been taking out a hundred thousand dollar ads in newspapers new york times and others
[03:10:51.200 --> 03:10:56.640]  complaining about the way we were being treated in international trade agreements this is something
[03:10:56.640 --> 03:11:01.680]  has been going on a long time and it seems to be the core issue for whether or not donald trump
[03:11:01.680 --> 03:11:06.000]  was going to run for president he said wait we let japan come in and we dump everything right in
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:11.600]  our markets they come over here they sell their cars or vcrs remember this was back in 1988 he said
[03:11:11.600 --> 03:11:15.520]  they knocked the hell out of our companies and hey i have tremendous respect for the japanese
[03:11:15.520 --> 03:11:20.160]  people that's this led oprah to ask him if he wanted to run for president which he replied well
[03:11:20.160 --> 03:11:25.120]  probably not but i do get tired of seeing the country ripped off i just don't think i have the
[03:11:25.120 --> 03:11:29.760]  inclination to do it he says if it got so bad i would never want to rule it out totally because
[03:11:29.760 --> 03:11:33.760]  i'm tired of seeing what's happening with this country we're really making other people live
[03:11:33.760 --> 03:11:39.360]  like kings and we're not it's gotten a lot worse in this amount of time and so when we look at
[03:11:39.360 --> 03:11:44.960]  marco robato with his secret secret he's got a secret with parts made in japan okay now they're
[03:11:44.960 --> 03:11:51.680]  made in china we have exported our jobs we're importing workers with the immigration system
[03:11:51.680 --> 03:12:01.360]  and of course we've got our own congressman like ted cruise like marco rubio like tre gowdy who voted
[03:12:01.360 --> 03:12:07.040]  with all them for the trans uh the trade promotion authority that haven't gotten to the tpp yet but
[03:12:07.040 --> 03:12:12.320]  the whole point of the trade promotion authority was to grease the skids so that there wouldn't be
[03:12:12.320 --> 03:12:18.640]  any opposition and to subvert the constitutional process for passing a treaty so when you look
[03:12:18.640 --> 03:12:25.600]  at these senators and congressmen who did this you gotta realize what they are doing is outsourcing
[03:12:25.600 --> 03:12:31.280]  their jobs they're outsourcing the congress's jobs who are they outsourcing it to they're outsourcing
[03:12:31.280 --> 03:12:36.320]  it to an international commission as senator sessions pointed out this international commission
[03:12:36.320 --> 03:12:44.080]  will then be free to manage our economy by managing our trade it is a massive surrendering of
[03:12:44.640 --> 03:12:50.160]  sovereignty to this international organization that has absolutely no accountability to us
[03:12:50.800 --> 03:12:55.120]  you know marco rubio when he was interviewed by a reporter said hey i haven't read the 5000 pages
[03:12:55.120 --> 03:12:59.840]  that's 5000 pages i'm going to rely on the international trade commission to tell me what
[03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:05.280]  to thank another bureaucracy okay he talked to the cfr he says i think it's very important
[03:13:05.280 --> 03:13:09.600]  more important than ever that congress give the president trade promotion authority this is the
[03:13:09.600 --> 03:13:15.200]  same guy that keeps repeating over and over again four or five times in the debate that you know
[03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:18.960]  barack obama we got to get over the fiction that he doesn't know what he's doing he knows exactly
[03:13:18.960 --> 03:13:23.280]  what he's doing he is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country he wants to make
[03:13:23.280 --> 03:13:28.000]  america like the rest of the world and yet marco rubio says we it's more important than ever
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:33.680]  that congress give the authority to manage our trade to barack obama understand this is not free
[03:13:33.680 --> 03:13:39.840]  trade that is the big lie the big lie that's being told by the republican party with everybody
[03:13:39.840 --> 03:13:44.240]  except for donald trump they're all telling you the big lie that this is about free trade
[03:13:44.240 --> 03:13:50.240]  it is not free trade you don't need 5000 pages for free trade you need 5000 pages if you're
[03:13:50.240 --> 03:13:54.880]  going to pull the wool over people's eyes if you're going to manage trade which means managing
[03:13:54.880 --> 03:14:01.120]  our economy having other people do it and it isn't even those 5000 pages because once the agreement
[03:14:01.120 --> 03:14:07.040]  is passed then all authority passes to this commission and it is as senator sessions pointed
[03:14:07.040 --> 03:14:14.560]  out a living agreement okay in other words it's not going to be limited to what is on the paper
[03:14:14.560 --> 03:14:20.080]  it's going to be whatever this trade commission wants it to be but let's play again we played it
[03:14:20.080 --> 03:14:26.480]  earlier in the day but i want you to hear again marco rubio just how robotic he is with his talking
[03:14:26.480 --> 03:14:32.960]  points again we've got uh marco uh short circuiting as he starts to repeat these talking points
[03:14:32.960 --> 03:14:38.640]  about controlling the family let's play that clip we are taking our message to families that are
[03:14:38.640 --> 03:14:42.960]  struggling to raise their children in the 21st century because as you saw janette and i are
[03:14:42.960 --> 03:14:47.600]  raising our four children in the 21st century and we know how hard it's become to instill our
[03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:54.080]  values in our kids instead of the values they try to ram down our throats in the 21st century
[03:14:54.080 --> 03:14:58.240]  it's become harder than ever to instill in your children the values they teach in our homes and
[03:14:58.240 --> 03:15:03.840]  in our church instead of the values that they try to ram down our throats in the movies and music
[03:15:03.840 --> 03:15:10.960]  in popular culture yeah it goes back and he does it again start skipping like a broken record
[03:15:10.960 --> 03:15:15.040]  whenever he loses his place he just resorts back to these or when he gets in a tight spot
[03:15:15.840 --> 03:15:21.440]  then he goes back to these canned memorized talking points and he's doubling down on this
[03:15:21.440 --> 03:15:26.960]  so he's not saying well i misspoke because that is the essence of who he is he can't say well you
[03:15:26.960 --> 03:15:31.520]  know i just misspoke everybody has a rough night it's a you know it's a it's a live event there's
[03:15:31.520 --> 03:15:36.880]  a lot of pressure everybody in the world is watching me etc etc no he can't be humble and say i made a
[03:15:36.880 --> 03:15:42.640]  mistake no he has to say i said what i meant to say and i'm going to keep saying it again okay well
[03:15:42.640 --> 03:15:49.280]  it's getting even worse as people are starting to uh troll his appearances dressed up like robots
[03:15:49.280 --> 03:15:56.480]  we got this one clip here rubio supporters getting in a scuffle with the hashtag robot rubio protester
[03:15:57.120 --> 03:16:02.320]  the the optics on this are not looking good for the rubio camp you know when people come up talking
[03:16:02.320 --> 03:16:07.680]  about how you are robotic tools of the establishment i don't think it's a good idea if you got that
[03:16:07.680 --> 03:16:11.600]  clip ready we can play that for the people who are watching this as b-roll i don't think it's a
[03:16:11.600 --> 03:16:19.600]  good idea to start banging protesters with your candidate's sign that's a marco rubio
[03:16:19.600 --> 03:16:24.240]  they've got they've got people grabbing this guy dressed up like a robot from behind and
[03:16:24.240 --> 03:16:30.160]  then they're beating him with a marco rubio for president's sign that does not look good that is
[03:16:30.160 --> 03:16:35.760]  a sign of massive desperation now i've got some other political stuff that i want oh actually
[03:16:35.760 --> 03:16:41.920]  before i get on to the robotic cars let me point out i mentioned this briefly in the first uh couple
[03:16:41.920 --> 03:16:46.240]  of minutes at the top of the hour we've got a story up on info wars dot com the delbert creator
[03:16:46.240 --> 03:16:51.200]  predicts that the g.o.p will rig new hampshire he thinks that they're going to rig it for marco
[03:16:51.200 --> 03:16:56.320]  roboto marco rubio scott adams creator of the popular delbert cartoon series predicts the g.o.p
[03:16:56.320 --> 03:17:01.680]  will rig tonight's primary in new hampshire in favor of us in favor of establishment favorite
[03:17:01.680 --> 03:17:07.520]  marco rubio on a blog posting he argues there's too much at stake for the fixers the fixers
[03:17:08.080 --> 03:17:12.240]  to not do anything to counter the juggernaut of donald trump's campaign he says they've
[03:17:12.240 --> 03:17:16.800]  got a big decision to make about how far they're willing to go with this if they don't fix the
[03:17:16.800 --> 03:17:22.080]  race or if they fix it only a little bit trump will win big he might be unstoppable you can't
[03:17:22.080 --> 03:17:27.200]  have that if you're the establishment fixers so he says there's no natural reason to expect rubio
[03:17:27.200 --> 03:17:33.600]  as the surprise search search that he did in iowa of course we see as he's many polls say
[03:17:33.600 --> 03:17:37.600]  that he's thinking we saw how how poorly he's doing because that would be too obvious so the
[03:17:37.600 --> 03:17:44.160]  fixers if such people exist yeah they do can't either lose a white house or they can risk getting
[03:17:44.160 --> 03:17:49.600]  caught by making too large a fix so which way would they go he says well he answers this question
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:55.200]  by saying they would go for the big fix they would risk detection any reasons that the people
[03:17:55.200 --> 03:17:59.760]  at the top are not the ones who would go to jail if the fix is detected that's right they're gonna
[03:17:59.760 --> 03:18:04.560]  have plausible deniability and they say his comments dovetail with reports that fox news has
[03:18:04.560 --> 03:18:09.600]  already published mock-up results that's a good way to call it mock-up results i think they mock
[03:18:09.600 --> 03:18:15.520]  our uh our uh knowledge of what's going on mock-up results from fox news show rubio in second place
[03:18:15.520 --> 03:18:21.920]  at 15 percent behind trump at 28 percent okay taking him down a few points i think there's
[03:18:21.920 --> 03:18:26.000]  another aspect of this i mean they may try to just pull out the stops and go for broke
[03:18:26.800 --> 03:18:31.760]  so we don't care what people think about this we're going to rig it the other aspect of this i
[03:18:31.760 --> 03:18:38.800]  think is that they're pushing hard to try to show that jeb bush has got momentum jeb bush has got
[03:18:38.800 --> 03:18:44.720]  momentum it reminds me of what they did with rick santorum in iowa four years ago against ron paul
[03:18:44.720 --> 03:18:50.400]  pulling him up uh so that they could keep romney in so that they could pull down ron paul so they
[03:18:50.400 --> 03:18:56.320]  could use this this ringer to come in as a stalking horse essentially so we'll see what happens i think
[03:18:56.320 --> 03:19:02.400]  the system is definitely rigging this for marco rubio as well as for jeb bush we'll see what's
[03:19:02.400 --> 03:19:08.640]  going on with that as we're looking at robotic candidates there's this story that i started
[03:19:08.640 --> 03:19:12.800]  to talk about that was on drudge why driverless cars will screech to a halt and of course the
[03:19:12.800 --> 03:19:18.400]  person there says there are huge liability and regulatory issues involved in letting a 3 000
[03:19:18.400 --> 03:19:24.160]  pound death machine steer itself with no humans at the controls okay he says think about it every
[03:19:24.160 --> 03:19:28.720]  driver makes hundreds of daily driving decisions that strictly speaking break laws for example
[03:19:29.600 --> 03:19:34.640]  pulling around the yellow line crossing yellow line to pull around a double parked vehicle he goes
[03:19:34.640 --> 03:19:39.760]  will a self-driving car do that will they be able to program a self-driving car to make that kind
[03:19:39.760 --> 03:19:46.480]  of intelligent decisions and as i'm visualizing this i can see the cars starting to stack up all
[03:19:46.480 --> 03:19:51.840]  these self-driving cars too timid to go around the yellow line that's only one of the problems there
[03:19:51.840 --> 03:19:56.560]  are many problems but of course the same fixers that going to fix this election are going to fix
[03:19:56.560 --> 03:20:01.600]  that we'll tell you how that's going to happen when we come back wildfires hurricanes tornadoes

[03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:43.840]  seven p.m eastern just as the polls are closing in new hampshire as we have to break i was talking
[03:25:43.840 --> 03:25:48.240]  about this article it's on the drudge report about uh why driverless cars will screech to
[03:25:48.240 --> 03:25:52.320]  halt and of course the person points out the obvious issue that we've got these massive
[03:25:53.120 --> 03:25:57.680]  cars that are going to be driven by computer programs and of course that creates a big
[03:25:57.680 --> 03:26:02.880]  liability issue have you ever had a computer that crashed yeah but you didn't die when it
[03:26:02.880 --> 03:26:09.600]  crashed did you okay i would not trust microsoft or google for that matter uh i would not trust a
[03:26:09.600 --> 03:26:14.560]  piece of software that they wrote to drive my car as a matter of fact here's the reality anybody
[03:26:14.560 --> 03:26:19.520]  that has an iphone or any of these other devices you understand that once you buy a computer
[03:26:20.400 --> 03:26:24.880]  and then there's new revisions of the operating system that come out down the road so when you
[03:26:24.880 --> 03:26:30.640]  get the iphone yeah everything is usually working pretty good and then a year or two later they start
[03:26:30.640 --> 03:26:35.920]  doing updates and things don't work as well on your computer anymore can you imagine that that's
[03:26:35.920 --> 03:26:41.200]  going to happen with the self-driving cars when you start to get they find out that there's some
[03:26:41.200 --> 03:26:46.320]  vulnerabilities and these things are big issues they have to fix these vulnerabilities these bugs
[03:26:46.320 --> 03:26:50.880]  and their self-driving software so they're going to release an update to fix that bug and what
[03:26:50.880 --> 03:26:56.160]  happens the same thing is going to happen that happens with your iPhones they're going to get
[03:26:56.160 --> 03:27:02.960]  far less reliable as time goes on and so is this really a good idea understand that even though we
[03:27:02.960 --> 03:27:08.480]  see a problem in the safety issues of this google and all the people who are selling us this pie in
[03:27:08.480 --> 03:27:15.200]  the sky about self-driving cars are selling it to us telling us that it's going to end all automobile
[03:27:15.200 --> 03:27:21.520]  deaths say we have over 30,000 people a year dying in automobiles and we are going to take that number
[03:27:21.520 --> 03:27:27.920]  to zero Volvo is very adamant nobody's going to die in their cars they've got one particular model
[03:27:27.920 --> 03:27:32.800]  that they're selling that on do you really believe that do they really believe that that's the issue
[03:27:32.800 --> 03:27:37.280]  do the car companies that are telling you that their cars are going to be so safe their self-driving
[03:27:37.280 --> 03:27:41.760]  cars are going to be so safe that nobody's going to die in it do they really believe that if they
[03:27:41.760 --> 03:27:47.920]  did would they be screaming bloody murder about states putting on additional safety regulations
[03:27:47.920 --> 03:27:54.960]  would they be going to washington and getting washington to override any state and local
[03:27:54.960 --> 03:27:59.840]  safety regulations no they don't believe that they don't believe that they're safe their their
[03:27:59.840 --> 03:28:05.680]  actions show that they don't believe that they're safe but as this guy says he says i fear the
[03:28:05.680 --> 03:28:10.240]  government is starting to wear down no the government is not wearing down the government
[03:28:10.240 --> 03:28:16.640]  is being bought off by the same corporations that run everything the same people that wrote the
[03:28:16.640 --> 03:28:22.480]  trans specific partnership they are also going to be writing all the rules of the road folks and
[03:28:22.480 --> 03:28:26.320]  they're going to be mandating vehicle to vehicle communication devices that you're going to have
[03:28:26.320 --> 03:28:30.560]  to pay for that you're going to have to maintain that are going to increase the cost of your car
[03:28:30.560 --> 03:28:34.640]  they're going to also along with that it's going to be vehicle to infrastructure and that's where
[03:28:34.640 --> 03:28:38.080]  the insurance companies are going to come in that's why the insurance companies like this
[03:28:38.080 --> 03:28:42.800]  because they're going to be able to watch every little thing that you do and charge you for every
[03:28:42.800 --> 03:28:47.760]  little infraction they will elevate the risks maybe they'll pass this information on to the
[03:28:47.760 --> 03:28:52.560]  government so they can write you speeding tickets say you didn't pause long enough at the stop sign
[03:28:52.560 --> 03:28:58.720]  whatever but consider this today okay when they tell you that this is all going to be so safe
[03:28:58.720 --> 03:29:07.520]  consider this today we had a tragedy in Bavaria Germany nine dead 150 injured as two passenger
[03:29:07.520 --> 03:29:15.200]  trains collide head on head on in Germany okay now this is a situation that is not nearly as
[03:29:15.200 --> 03:29:22.800]  complicated as even driving a car down the interstate highway you've got trains on a rail and even
[03:29:22.800 --> 03:29:27.920]  with that you've got head-on collisions that's not supposed to happen they've been doing this for a
[03:29:27.920 --> 03:29:34.000]  long time they've got backup systems they've got very sophisticated electronics and sensors to keep
[03:29:34.000 --> 03:29:40.000]  all this from happening and tell that to the nine dead 150 injured and think about it when you think
[03:29:40.000 --> 03:29:44.320]  you want to get into a car that they're going to drive that the government is going to control that
[03:29:44.320 --> 03:29:49.840]  they're going to use to establish a surveillance grid to tax and track you we're on the march the
[03:29:49.840 --> 03:30:01.520]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network if polls are to be believed hillary clinton's

[03:33:26.080 --> 03:33:29.920]  happening there and about our coverage tonight i want to cover some financial news here of course we
[03:33:29.920 --> 03:33:36.720]  have even more volatility on wall street it's been a bad year so far and today uh usa today reports
[03:33:36.720 --> 03:33:41.840]  volatility continues to rule on wall street stocks are bouncing around and choppy trading today with
[03:33:41.840 --> 03:33:47.840]  a dow jones about 100 points down amid another steep drop in oil prices and global stock turmoil
[03:33:47.840 --> 03:33:54.800]  that saw japanese shares fall more than five percent overnight and of course things are not
[03:33:54.800 --> 03:34:00.400]  going to get better if you have robot cars that lay off one and a half million transportation
[03:34:00.400 --> 03:34:05.680]  workers just in the trucking industry alone or the other story that we didn't cover this up on
[03:34:05.680 --> 03:34:10.640]  financial times it was a drudge report linked to it robots will force experts to find other routes
[03:34:10.640 --> 03:34:17.120]  to the top that article on financial times is talking about the impact on white collar jobs
[03:34:17.120 --> 03:34:21.120]  it isn't just going to be the factory workers it isn't going to be the agricultural workers the
[03:34:21.120 --> 03:34:26.800]  transportation workers it's also going to be the white collar workers that are going to be affected
[03:34:26.800 --> 03:34:32.720]  by this this is why this particular change in the economy is so fundamentally different than
[03:34:32.720 --> 03:34:37.680]  any other that we've seen before we've had a revolution going from an agricultural to an
[03:34:37.680 --> 03:34:42.880]  industrial society we've seen the kinds of displacements but they always were typically
[03:34:42.880 --> 03:34:49.600]  limited to one particular area at a time this is going to cause massive unemployment across the
[03:34:49.600 --> 03:34:54.960]  full employment spectrum every type of job every type of job for example financial times is saying
[03:34:54.960 --> 03:35:01.920]  when it comes to the future futurists concede that few expert lawyers or consultants or
[03:35:01.920 --> 03:35:06.960]  accountants will still be needed and even after cheaper more efficient computer systems have
[03:35:06.960 --> 03:35:12.640]  taken over many of their junior partners jobs okay so this is going to affect everybody it's
[03:35:12.640 --> 03:35:18.880]  going to affect analysts and managers everyone you have to understand that the globalists and
[03:35:18.880 --> 03:35:22.960]  as they're looking at this we go back and we look at what's a big new brzezinski was talking about
[03:35:22.960 --> 03:35:26.560]  saying that you know we're going to have a technocratic society we don't really need that many
[03:35:26.560 --> 03:35:32.000]  people we're going to find ways to get rid of them and the globalists liked what he had to say so
[03:35:32.000 --> 03:35:37.920]  much back in 1970 that they made him a couple years later head of the trilateral commission and if
[03:35:37.920 --> 03:35:43.520]  you look at the trilateral commission and how it broke the world into three fundamental blocks so
[03:35:43.520 --> 03:35:48.480]  they could then once they unified those three fundamental blocks then they could pull them
[03:35:48.480 --> 03:35:53.920]  together into a unified global whole that's what we are seeing now with these trade deals
[03:35:53.920 --> 03:36:01.600]  you have to understand just as we saw in europe european union began as a trade and economic union
[03:36:01.600 --> 03:36:07.680]  and now it is trying they're trying to move it to a political union and how do they do that
[03:36:07.680 --> 03:36:13.440]  well they do that by first creating the economic union then creating economic problems and then
[03:36:13.440 --> 03:36:17.280]  saying well because of the economic problems inside of our economic union we're going to have to
[03:36:17.280 --> 03:36:22.480]  have more political control to keep this thing together and that's a strategy that's the way
[03:36:22.480 --> 03:36:26.880]  they pull it all together and then they have the north american union european union that's
[03:36:26.880 --> 03:36:32.880]  why we have the trans pacific the transatlantic trade agreements understand that north america
[03:36:33.440 --> 03:36:39.120]  is the hinge on which the other two hang we are the ones who are bringing it all together
[03:36:39.120 --> 03:36:44.800]  we are the center of the new world order we're the ones who have been taken over the most completely
[03:36:44.800 --> 03:36:49.280]  and the ones who've been taken over first and as we look at this financial situation
[03:36:49.280 --> 03:36:55.680]  look at these other articles that have come out just in the last day feds may lack the legal ability
[03:36:56.240 --> 03:37:02.160]  to do negative interest rates and this goes back to a 2010 memo folks they've been planning this
[03:37:02.160 --> 03:37:08.240]  for a long time saying they're going to put in negative interest rates okay confiscate people's
[03:37:08.800 --> 03:37:13.200]  savings above a given level this is something we've been warning people about for a long time
[03:37:13.200 --> 03:37:17.440]  everybody oh i haven't heard anything about that a couple of years ago and then the european banks
[03:37:17.440 --> 03:37:24.400]  did it and now we find that the american central bank has been planning this for at least six years
[03:37:24.400 --> 03:37:29.040]  and of course they look at it and they say well you know the law that authorized the fed to pay
[03:37:29.040 --> 03:37:35.120]  interest rates on excess reserves may not grant it the authority to charge interest but don't worry
[03:37:35.120 --> 03:37:40.160]  we think we might be able to find a workaround yeah just ignore it just ignore the law just do
[03:37:40.160 --> 03:37:44.320]  whatever you want just buy off some legislators have them change it whatever there's a number of
[03:37:44.320 --> 03:37:47.920]  ways that they can cut this but of course what they're going to do is they're going to start
[03:37:47.920 --> 03:37:54.400]  charging people negative interest rates in another article looking at the sell-off of european banks
[03:37:54.400 --> 03:37:58.080]  talking about how ominous that is they say the current environment for european banks is very
[03:37:58.080 --> 03:38:02.720]  very bad over a full business cycle i think it's very questionable whether banks on average
[03:38:02.720 --> 03:38:07.760]  are able to cover their cost of equity as a result that makes it an unattractive investment for
[03:38:07.760 --> 03:38:14.320]  long-term investors that's peter garnery head of equity strategy at saxo bank now why is it such a
[03:38:14.320 --> 03:38:19.920]  bad deal for people to buy banking stocks well in the same article they talk about negative
[03:38:19.920 --> 03:38:24.640]  interest rates that have been set up by the european central bank do you see a pattern here
[03:38:25.200 --> 03:38:31.040]  with the central bank sets up negative interest rates and starts uh bankrupting the banks
[03:38:31.040 --> 03:38:37.200]  bankrupting the economy and of course all this will also be used as a push towards a cashless
[03:38:37.200 --> 03:38:42.560]  society so the banks are getting squeezed uh they're losing money because of negative interest
[03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:47.680]  rates and now they're looking to do the same thing here in america so let's take a look at how
[03:38:47.680 --> 03:38:53.520]  this system is stacked we've had the first votes come in from new hampshire as i mentioned earlier
[03:38:53.520 --> 03:38:58.320]  the small towns that have less than a hundred people in them can begin voting at midnight
[03:38:58.320 --> 03:39:03.680]  once all those people have voted they can report the votes and so we have three small towns that
[03:39:03.680 --> 03:39:10.160]  historically do that we have dicksville notch mills field and hearts location they have now
[03:39:10.160 --> 03:39:14.480]  reported their results now before i tell you the results i'll give you a little bit of story here
[03:39:14.480 --> 03:39:20.960]  going back to 1992 i was working with a libertarian party our candidate there at the time was a guy
[03:39:20.960 --> 03:39:26.720]  named andre maru he was out of alaska he had been elected as a state representative in alaska he was
[03:39:26.720 --> 03:39:31.520]  running for president he had 50 state ballot excess i believe he'd been ron paul's vice
[03:39:31.520 --> 03:39:36.800]  presidential candidate uh when ron paul ran four years earlier in 1988 as a libertarian
[03:39:37.520 --> 03:39:45.280]  and uh an interesting thing happened in dicksville notch we were watching the returns that night
[03:39:45.280 --> 03:39:48.960]  because we knew dicksville notch was going to come in and we'd had some tips within the libertarian
[03:39:48.960 --> 03:39:53.040]  party people said we think we're going to get some good results out of dicksville notch and the
[03:39:53.040 --> 03:39:58.400]  person who won dicksville notch was andre maru i still remember watching uh the program and the
[03:39:58.400 --> 03:40:04.560]  newscaster says uh we've got the first returns in and the winner is andre maru he goes who
[03:40:05.920 --> 03:40:11.600]  never heard of him how did that happen well the most interesting thing about that is is the way
[03:40:11.600 --> 03:40:15.360]  that it happened what they did and the reason they thought they were going to get good results was
[03:40:15.360 --> 03:40:21.360]  because an activist had given every one of the people in that tiny location a subscription
[03:40:21.360 --> 03:40:27.760]  to a libertarian magazine and it had an effect now there's a lesson in that and the lesson is
[03:40:27.760 --> 03:40:33.920]  that we can wake people up we can educate people and that's what you're seeing happening with the
[03:40:33.920 --> 03:40:39.040]  internet with a drug report with info wars with all the uh media that is not the mainstream media
[03:40:39.040 --> 03:40:46.000]  you can have an effect and we are seeing that effect in this election people are saying sanders
[03:40:46.000 --> 03:40:54.800]  who trump who okay this is the effect that we saw in a very tiny way back in dicksville notch
[03:40:54.800 --> 03:41:01.680]  in 1992 giving people information that they had not seen before explaining it backing it up
[03:41:01.680 --> 03:41:07.120]  giving them the underlying uh uh information to uh to show them what is really happening giving
[03:41:07.120 --> 03:41:11.520]  them the full information that was being hidden from them by the mainstream media taking them
[03:41:11.520 --> 03:41:16.880]  out of the controlled bubble and i think we ought to start calling them the eyewash media remember
[03:41:16.880 --> 03:41:22.880]  that was that uh uh story where they were talking about eyewash was originally uh it's it's actually
[03:41:22.880 --> 03:41:27.520]  the uh intelligence community's phrase for what we would call compartmentalization saying we're
[03:41:27.520 --> 03:41:34.080]  going to feed information to the lower people in the cia or the nsa or the fbi whatever they're
[03:41:34.080 --> 03:41:38.160]  going to get uh one set of information but the people at the top uh they see what's really
[03:41:38.160 --> 03:41:42.720]  going to be done in many cases they're diametrically opposite to the information that's given to the
[03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:47.120]  lower people you can call that compartmentalization they call it eyewashing you know kind of like
[03:41:47.120 --> 03:41:53.360]  brainwashing but it's eyewashing we ought to call it the eyewash media and when you get the eyewash
[03:41:53.360 --> 03:41:59.760]  media out of your eyes and you can see what is really going on it changes things and so now we've
[03:41:59.760 --> 03:42:06.000]  got a very different election cycle and it's there because of the internet it's there because of the
[03:42:06.000 --> 03:42:10.960]  alternative media because of the true media that's out there but when you look at the results of
[03:42:10.960 --> 03:42:15.520]  what's going on in dicksville notch uh here's some of the results here at cnn and see if you
[03:42:15.520 --> 03:42:20.000]  guys can pull this up on the screen there cnn looks at the results and of course uh you look at
[03:42:20.000 --> 03:42:26.000]  these three small towns you've got 17 votes for sanders and you got nine votes for clinton okay
[03:42:26.000 --> 03:42:31.600]  zero percent of voting is in in essence okay this very very small sample of these three small towns
[03:42:31.600 --> 03:42:37.440]  17 and 9 and when i looked at this i thought okay well that's fine what caught my eye though
[03:42:37.440 --> 03:42:42.240]  was when you look over to the right hand side and you look at the number of delegates so here
[03:42:42.240 --> 03:42:50.640]  we've got uh 26 people have voted and hillary clinton has six delegates and bernie sanders has
[03:42:50.640 --> 03:42:58.400]  zero how did that happen she's already got six delegates six out of the eight super delegates
[03:42:58.400 --> 03:43:05.280]  are already there for hillary clinton and bernie sanders has none okay now on the republican side
[03:43:05.280 --> 03:43:11.760]  there aren't any delegates that have been awarded yet because this super delegate situation is really
[03:43:11.760 --> 03:43:17.440]  a democrat party rigging that's going on going back to the middle of november i want to read
[03:43:17.440 --> 03:43:23.840]  you an article here most new hampshire democrat super delegates back clinton now this was from
[03:43:23.840 --> 03:43:29.440]  a local new hampshire paper back in the middle of november november the 13th and they said among
[03:43:29.440 --> 03:43:35.520]  new hampshire's eight super delegates six are back in clinton the seventh democrat party chairman
[03:43:35.520 --> 03:43:40.960]  ray buckley is prohibited from supporting anyone in the primary and the eighth state senator martha
[03:43:40.960 --> 03:43:46.640]  fuller clark of portsmith says she may wait until after the primary to endorse and they point out
[03:43:46.640 --> 03:43:51.200]  super delegates can support the candidate of their choice regardless of what happens in primaries
[03:43:51.760 --> 03:43:58.240]  who are these privileged elite who get to choose whoever they want okay well it turns out they're
[03:43:58.240 --> 03:44:06.240]  a pretty sizable uh uh chunk of the total number of delegates there are 712 super delegates in the
[03:44:06.240 --> 03:44:14.080]  democrat party that's 30 percent of the 2382 delegates that you need to win the nomination
[03:44:14.880 --> 03:44:20.480]  and they point out that two months at that point in time two months before any voting started
[03:44:20.480 --> 03:44:26.880]  clinton at that time back in the middle of november already had 15 percent of the delegates
[03:44:26.880 --> 03:44:33.120]  that she needed to win the ap went out and did a poll of these super delegates and they asked
[03:44:33.120 --> 03:44:42.240]  them who they were going to pick clinton got 62 percent sanders 1 percent omali 0.3 percent
[03:44:42.240 --> 03:44:49.200]  and uncommitted was 36 percent now think about that clinton had 62 percent of the super delegates
[03:44:49.200 --> 03:44:54.480]  that answered the poll and 80 percent of them uh came back and answered the poll sanders only had
[03:44:54.480 --> 03:45:01.360]  1 percent that is the establishment closing behind hillary clinton that's why hillary clinton
[03:45:01.360 --> 03:45:07.440]  thinks she can do whatever she wishes and still win this game it's because of the establishment
[03:45:07.440 --> 03:45:12.960]  backing her the same thing happens in more subtle ways in the republican party now again
[03:45:12.960 --> 03:45:17.920]  who are these people who are these people that get to pick the president in the democrat party
[03:45:18.800 --> 03:45:23.760]  well they are people who are elected officials they're super delegates automatically
[03:45:24.640 --> 03:45:28.160]  people who are members of congress and other elected officials you have party leaders and
[03:45:28.160 --> 03:45:33.040]  of course you have members of the democrat national committee you know people like debbie
[03:45:33.040 --> 03:45:40.400]  wassenman schultz or as we call her shill okay who set up this ridiculous debate schedule to
[03:45:40.400 --> 03:45:46.400]  benefit her friend hillary clinton now in the republican party there also are super delegates
[03:45:46.400 --> 03:45:54.560]  these are typically only though three per state so maybe about 150 versus the over 750 that the
[03:45:54.560 --> 03:46:01.680]  democrats have so there's about five times as many of them in the democrat party as there are
[03:46:01.680 --> 03:46:07.040]  in the republican party and in the republican party the super delegates are rnc committee
[03:46:07.040 --> 03:46:12.800]  members two of those as well as the state chair of the rnc that's how the establishment
[03:46:13.360 --> 03:46:18.480]  starts to put this stuff together now of course there's other games that are played in the
[03:46:18.480 --> 03:46:24.560]  GOP in terms of picking delegates they are not as straightforward and honest as that may appear to
[03:46:24.560 --> 03:46:28.640]  be when you just look at the super delegate thing they have a lot of different ways that they can
[03:46:28.640 --> 03:46:33.040]  play with the delegates and that's what they're talking about when they talk about a brokered
[03:46:33.040 --> 03:46:38.320]  convention something that we used to see happening all the time i find it interesting
[03:46:38.320 --> 03:46:43.920]  too as we look through this this this statement by bill as he's dumping for hillary clinton again
[03:46:43.920 --> 03:46:48.720]  this is on the dredge report sometimes i wish we weren't married he says sometimes when i'm on a
[03:46:48.720 --> 03:46:53.920]  stage like this i wish that we weren't married then i could say what i really think said bill
[03:46:53.920 --> 03:46:59.840]  clinton he says i don't mean that in a negative way i'm happy really i am dear he says that the
[03:46:59.840 --> 03:47:04.400]  hotter this election gets the more i wish i was just a former president and just for a few months
[03:47:04.400 --> 03:47:09.760]  not the spouse of the next one because you know i have to be careful what i say yeah he has to be
[03:47:09.760 --> 03:47:15.920]  very careful what he says because you know hillary has a really bad temper and she tends to throw
[03:47:15.920 --> 03:47:21.600]  things we've seen that happening before now when you look on the republican side of course one of
[03:47:21.600 --> 03:47:25.920]  the ways that this is rigged and we've talked about this a great deal i mentioned at the very
[03:47:25.920 --> 03:47:31.520]  beginning about the effect of uh the alternative media about people being able to get information
[03:47:31.520 --> 03:47:38.960]  on the internet we see that uh the mainstream media especially on the republican side fox news
[03:47:38.960 --> 03:47:45.440]  is the 800 pound elephant they still have tremendous sway to uh uh to manipulate the
[03:47:45.440 --> 03:47:52.080]  GOP voters and i look at this article that was on wnd with meghan kelly asking does donald trump
[03:47:52.080 --> 03:47:58.880]  want to shoot me how's that for fair and balanced you know i mean it is just absolutely amazing
[03:47:58.880 --> 03:48:03.440]  remember that when she started and this what is what started the whole feud between her and donald
[03:48:03.440 --> 03:48:07.680]  trump she says you once told a contestant on celebrity apprentice that it would be a pretty
[03:48:07.680 --> 03:48:12.000]  picture to see her on her knees does that sound to you like the temperament of a man that we should
[03:48:12.000 --> 03:48:18.560]  elect as president you are part of the war on women she implied okay really is she is he really
[03:48:18.560 --> 03:48:23.520]  part of the war on women uh how's that for fair and balanced to sit she doubled down on this okay
[03:48:24.240 --> 03:48:29.760]  she goes on television and uh on a talk show she says well the only thing i really want to
[03:48:29.760 --> 03:48:34.720]  ask donald trump was he recently said his supporters are so devoted to him that he could go in the
[03:48:34.720 --> 03:48:39.680]  middle of fifth avenue and shoot somebody and he wouldn't lose a single voter and in response i want
[03:48:39.680 --> 03:48:45.360]  to ask him were you talking about me and then she smiled and said well i never go to fifth avenue
[03:48:45.360 --> 03:48:53.520]  anymore okay never ends with meghan kelly i guess uh is she really a news person or is this all just
[03:48:53.520 --> 03:49:00.960]  about meghan kelly the celebrity journalist okay but but they're still pushing marco rubio
[03:49:00.960 --> 03:49:06.000]  and as i mentioned before they're still fox news is still saying that they see him at 15 percent
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:12.240]  and second place to donald trump let's play a clip that we had earlier of chris christy this is one
[03:49:12.240 --> 03:49:17.440]  that uh we had not played in the beginning of the clip the one with christy in the restaurant
[03:49:17.440 --> 03:49:22.560]  you guys got that ready yeah let's play that what he said continue to talk about marco rubio the robot
[03:49:23.520 --> 03:49:29.040]  the biggest attacker in this race has been marco rubio he puts that little smile on his face
[03:49:29.040 --> 03:49:34.160]  and then he sends his super pack out to cut people's throats we don't need another duplicitous
[03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:39.520]  washington dc politician in the white house we already have one we don't need another one
[03:49:39.520 --> 03:49:42.880]  marco needs to go get some experience and when he does maybe he can run for president again
[03:49:42.880 --> 03:49:48.560]  and he's a typical washington drive-by politician no experience but a lot of talking points that he
[03:49:48.560 --> 03:49:52.880]  just got you know from his op research guys is there anything that marco says that he doesn't get
[03:49:52.880 --> 03:49:56.640]  from his staff and it's not just his super pack that's going to go out and cut people's throats
[03:49:56.640 --> 03:50:01.120]  it's people like megan kelly and fox news that will go out and cut his opponent's throats
[03:50:01.120 --> 03:50:05.760]  now when she tried to paint donald trump as part of the war on women i think it's very
[03:50:05.760 --> 03:50:10.800]  interesting to see what has happened in the last couple of days we've got this article here uh on

[03:55:20.320 --> 03:55:26.800]  life dot com one of the things that i came across today that my wife sent me i was very troubling
[03:55:26.800 --> 03:55:30.800]  i haven't had time to look at the actual bill itself this goes back to february the third and
[03:55:30.800 --> 03:55:37.680]  this is a the marshal report they say cruise legislation attacks homeschooling and lockstep
[03:55:37.680 --> 03:55:43.360]  with the un's one world education and what they're saying here is that he's part of this federal
[03:55:43.360 --> 03:55:48.320]  education choice he's added some amendments to a bill that was originally put out by senator uh
[03:55:48.960 --> 03:55:55.040]  senator messer and uh they feel that it's very deceptive because what it does is it means that
[03:55:55.040 --> 03:56:00.800]  if you choose to homeschool your homeschooling will now fall under the classification of a
[03:56:00.800 --> 03:56:06.240]  private school and it will bring in all of the federal regulations that are included on that
[03:56:06.240 --> 03:56:12.160]  because they're going to offer it to you initially as benefits we're going to give you some funding
[03:56:12.160 --> 03:56:17.520]  that is a trap that homeschoolers have been offered over and over again in various states
[03:56:18.080 --> 03:56:22.480]  will give you some funding for your homeschooling because you know you're having to pay taxes
[03:56:22.480 --> 03:56:26.720]  property taxes to support the school whether you own your own home or whether you're renting a home
[03:56:26.720 --> 03:56:31.280]  you still have to pay property taxes all those property taxes are going to the government's
[03:56:31.280 --> 03:56:37.120]  schools so let us help you a little bit well it will give you some money for your child's education
[03:56:37.120 --> 03:56:41.680]  but when they give that to you beware of the strings that come attached as they're pointing
[03:56:41.680 --> 03:56:49.440]  out with this if you get classified as a private school and if you get the title one funding that
[03:56:49.440 --> 03:56:56.240]  was added by senator cruz then what happens is your school your private school that's what
[03:56:56.240 --> 03:57:00.880]  they're going to call your homeschool if you accept those funds if you allow them to classify you
[03:57:00.880 --> 03:57:05.760]  as a private school and get the title one funding then what that means is that you're going to now
[03:57:05.760 --> 03:57:13.040]  be subject to common core mandates you're also going to see a lot of other regulations that
[03:57:13.040 --> 03:57:17.760]  are going to come that way and so that's one of the things that concerns me about Ted Cruz I've
[03:57:17.760 --> 03:57:23.200]  got to say that from the very beginning I felt that he is one of the most sneaky and underhanded
[03:57:23.200 --> 03:57:28.160]  people I've ever seen that's just my personal opinion of him I never felt like I could trust him
[03:57:28.160 --> 03:57:35.600]  and when I saw what he did to Ben Carson in the Iowa caucus that just underscored my gut feeling
[03:57:35.600 --> 03:57:41.920]  about this man I don't know who this guy is quite frankly he's somebody who is not anywhere even
[03:57:41.920 --> 03:57:47.520]  remotely eligible to run for president in my understanding of the Constitution he's a Canadian
[03:57:47.520 --> 03:57:55.680]  citizen he's a globalist his wife works with Goldman Sachs works with the CFR doing a study
[03:57:55.680 --> 03:58:00.720]  about the North American Union maybe he is the North American Union president who wants to come in
[03:58:00.720 --> 03:58:06.640]  and you know we've got a North American Union why can't somebody from Canada or Mexico be the president
[03:58:06.640 --> 03:58:12.000]  of the United States I guess they can well join us tonight we're going to have live coverage of the
[03:58:12.000 --> 03:58:17.440]  New Hampshire primary results that's going to begin at 7 central 8 p.m. Eastern with a nightly news
