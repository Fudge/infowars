[00:00.000 --> 00:13.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.400 --> 00:31.080]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones ladies and
[00:31.080 --> 00:36.960]  gentlemen I am back in the saddle from my visit to Detroit Michigan and Kalamazoo as well my
[00:36.960 --> 00:42.080]  cousin's wedding I'm your host Alex Jones I'll be here live all this week 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. this
[00:42.080 --> 00:48.000]  is obviously another important transmission coming up today on this Monday already the 29th
[00:48.000 --> 00:56.480]  day of June 2015 it was the top big link on drudge report today Americans signed a petition to ban
[00:56.480 --> 01:01.680]  the American flag and it's no joke I first said that a few weeks ago limbo and others made the
[01:01.680 --> 01:07.440]  point and Farrakhan obviously called for it last week which is kind of reasonable in a way I mean
[01:07.440 --> 01:11.400]  the American flag has had more slaves under it than the Confederate if you go by that benchmark
[01:11.400 --> 01:17.640]  the Greece collapse is now admittedly happening and Jim Rogers one of the top analysts says you
[01:17.640 --> 01:22.720]  ain't seen nothing yet we're gonna get into that we're gonna get into huge news on the second
[01:22.720 --> 01:29.040]  amendment front and so much more very important broadcast huge news on Isis we're saying no one
[01:29.040 --> 01:36.480]  could see these attacks coming really we've only perseverated on it for four years warning of the
[01:36.480 --> 01:41.640]  so-called rebels blowing back on the West by design it's all coming up today but first the
[01:41.640 --> 01:46.280]  Pope comes out hardcore against the second amendment and for world government John bound
[01:46.280 --> 01:51.920]  reports Joe Biggs here with info wars dot com now this week the Pope decided to go full
[01:51.920 --> 01:58.040]  retard when he released a statement saying the gun manufacturers are not Christians well I find
[01:58.040 --> 02:03.720]  that extremely funny to hear that coming from the Pope because here at info wars dot com we
[02:03.720 --> 02:10.680]  do have a Christian owned gun manufacturer as a sponsor head down rifles now their CEO and co-founder
[02:10.680 --> 02:17.040]  David Huntsucker released a statement where he was just completely in shock by the fact that the
[02:17.040 --> 02:24.560]  Pope would release such a statement going after manufacturers of guns this is a Christian owned
[02:24.560 --> 02:31.200]  company these guys provide a service for families who do not have the money to go to these expensive
[02:31.200 --> 02:38.840]  grocery stores and buy food head down rifles allows families to go out hunt put food on the
[02:38.840 --> 02:46.080]  table for their families now also they provide a service in security now why do we need security
[02:46.080 --> 02:51.400]  because we live in a world where bad things do happen there are people out there who intend to do
[02:51.400 --> 02:58.040]  harm to you your family and your belongings so it's a takes it you have to take it upon yourself
[02:58.040 --> 03:06.960]  to go out and protect yourself and your family now there is a verse in the Bible Luke 22 verse
[03:06.960 --> 03:15.800]  36 Jesus says to them but now if you have a purse take it and also a bag and if you don't have a
[03:15.800 --> 03:20.520]  sword sell your cloak and buy one now what does that mean if you're gonna have you're gonna be
[03:20.520 --> 03:26.760]  walking around out there you need to be able to protect yourself this is in the Bible but the
[03:26.760 --> 03:33.520]  Pope doesn't want you to have that he's jumping on board with Obama with Feinstein with Holder
[03:33.520 --> 03:40.440]  what happens in areas where they go and grab your guns look what happened in France with the
[03:40.440 --> 03:46.440]  Charlie Hebdo attacks when ISIS was able to just move freely about and shoot things up kill people
[03:46.440 --> 03:53.160]  look what happens when ISIS comes to Texas here in the US they get shot down why because we are
[03:53.160 --> 04:01.000]  able to protect ourselves we live in a world where bad people do bad things and you have to
[04:01.000 --> 04:07.400]  sometimes take it upon yourself to protect yourself there's not always gonna be this divine power
[04:07.400 --> 04:13.800]  that's gonna jump down and stop a bullet coming at you you need to be able to pick up a gun and
[04:13.800 --> 04:19.560]  be able to protect yourself and those around you and that's what it's all about it's funny how the
[04:19.560 --> 04:25.400]  people who want to take your guns are the ones who are most surrounded by them the president doesn't
[04:25.400 --> 04:32.840]  want us to be able to have our guns and yet he is completely protected by tons of people with
[04:32.840 --> 04:40.600]  firepower Feinstein completely protected by people with guns Eric Holder completely protected
[04:40.600 --> 04:46.760]  by people with guns when you look back in history at all these nations where the weapons were taken
[04:46.760 --> 04:52.040]  away from the population was murdered and that's Joe Biggs with that report there was another one
[04:52.040 --> 04:56.920]  that uh john bound to this excellent as well we're going to come back with the greek meltdown
[04:56.920 --> 05:02.760]  that's causing the world stock market to plunge do you know what it means to be an american it's
[05:02.760 --> 05:08.680]  more than a flag it's more than knowing the star spangled banner it's knowing the constitution it's
[05:08.680 --> 05:13.640]  understanding those rights and fighting for them our country is falling apart because people have
[05:13.640 --> 05:18.840]  forgotten to fight to stand up in the face of tyranny and do the right thing it's putting your
[05:18.840 --> 05:23.880]  life on the line to protect your country from enemies both foreign and domestic the bill of
[05:23.880 --> 05:29.480]  rights is what the people are entitled to against every government and no government should refuse
[05:29.480 --> 05:35.400]  or rest on inference so the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of

[08:02.920 --> 08:19.000]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[08:19.000 --> 08:33.560]  world government is going into high gear in our face decades of globalist preparation
[08:34.440 --> 08:40.360]  for planetary dictatorship by a scientific and technological elite enforced by a military
[08:40.360 --> 08:46.360]  industrial complex is now upon us everything else has been part of the overall takeover
[08:46.360 --> 08:53.480]  and then once the planet has been taken over the absolute consolidation of power and vertical
[08:53.480 --> 09:00.440]  integration begins they've taken over almost every government and almost every bank now they're
[09:00.440 --> 09:09.640]  going to take over the individual and the family now the real drilling in is commencing all hell
[09:09.640 --> 09:14.440]  is going to be breaking loose the enemy is assaulting on every front making more and more
[09:14.440 --> 09:20.680]  outrageous announcements to move the overton window and if you don't know what that is
[09:20.680 --> 09:27.160]  it's a political science term coined in the middle of the last century of how political elites only
[09:27.160 --> 09:33.160]  operate within what is seen as acceptable within the political paradigm within the establishment
[09:33.160 --> 09:39.640]  middle of the road but that they will have radicals out on the edge making announcements
[09:39.640 --> 09:45.800]  that sound over the top to make their announcements that are slightly out of the overton window
[09:45.800 --> 09:52.200]  not sound as radical so that you will accept what they're doing by increment because their
[09:52.200 --> 10:03.240]  vanguard is so far out having jocelyn elders 23 years ago as the surgeon general nominee
[10:03.240 --> 10:13.560]  calling for the school to help children ages five master bay in 1994 that sounded insane
[10:16.200 --> 10:25.880]  today it's standard sex education that's how you move the overton window so when you hear them
[10:25.880 --> 10:31.160]  announcing let's ban the american flag now and you hear them announcing you know men inherently
[10:31.160 --> 10:36.120]  are bad and families are inherently bad see it goes from tolerate different people alternative
[10:36.120 --> 10:45.240]  lifestyles using the true innate libertarianism of america and the west that created modern liberalism
[10:47.720 --> 10:55.720]  jeffersonian ideas and using our tolerance to then conquer us and we're not being conquered by
[10:55.720 --> 11:05.640]  transgenders folks they just use one of the most extreme novelties to get universal exception of
[11:05.640 --> 11:11.640]  that because then it sets the precedent for the social engineers to be able to set the precedent
[11:11.640 --> 11:18.440]  on any issue they want but you've got to have radical litmus tests to so confuse the political
[11:18.440 --> 11:25.320]  debate the public is often left field trying to find phantoms of racism banning paper bags and
[11:25.320 --> 11:30.360]  trying to ban thomas jefferson statues in austin texas and wanting to dig up confederate generals
[11:30.360 --> 11:37.000]  and move them out of cemeteries while the globalists are involved in a planetary program starving
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.400]  an additional 15 million people a year from what was just happening six years ago
[11:43.160 --> 11:48.120]  you had like 20 million people starving to death according to the un
[11:48.120 --> 11:57.800]  n a decade ago or so and now it's 35 40 million and it's all because of the global economy and
[11:57.800 --> 12:06.840]  what's been engineered and there's an argument by laze fair quasi liberal uh trendies well there
[12:06.840 --> 12:13.000]  are too many people but i should give up all my rights to stop man-made global warming supposedly
[12:13.000 --> 12:18.840]  to save the third world even though that's all about hearing so what they have is both thoughts
[12:18.840 --> 12:23.160]  in their mind at the same time they're liberal all lives are precious unless they're babies
[12:23.160 --> 12:27.320]  unless they're unborn unless they're old people less they're veterans we love minorities who are
[12:27.320 --> 12:31.480]  the majority worldwide but we got to have world government to save them even though it's killing
[12:31.480 --> 12:37.720]  them it's like calling the patriot act the patriot act or we discredit global warming
[12:37.720 --> 12:43.480]  being man-made that we're actually cooling now for at least a decade the cooling stopped 17 years
[12:43.480 --> 12:49.240]  ago i mean the the warming stopped 17 years ago and then the cooling started a decade ago
[12:50.520 --> 12:55.800]  so they just call it climate change now who can debate that there is climate change continually
[12:55.800 --> 12:57.720]  it's the only thing that's constant
[12:57.720 --> 13:08.120]  it's a war on language and a war on words where you can't even communicate with people
[13:09.880 --> 13:12.280]  and even the supposedly intellectual
[13:15.320 --> 13:17.000]  even the so-called informed
[13:19.880 --> 13:24.280]  are a very small percentage of people that actually read books or read the wall street
[13:24.280 --> 13:32.200]  journal or the new york times or who watch sunday news shows it's the informed in this country
[13:32.200 --> 13:37.240]  that are even aware of the political process and know who the names are and who the players are
[13:37.800 --> 13:44.120]  but that itself is a completely false projection and staged to an almost complete extent
[13:44.120 --> 13:52.280]  so you've got people within these artificial envelopes these artificial little bubble
[13:52.280 --> 13:59.640]  matrices walled off from the real reality that the globalists write about in their own books
[13:59.640 --> 14:08.280]  their own publications foreign affairs it's all there how do i continually know what they're
[14:08.280 --> 14:15.080]  going to do next day in day out week in week out month in month out year in year out decade in decade
[14:15.080 --> 14:22.600]  out because they've told us what they're going to do and they've done it over and over again in third
[14:22.600 --> 14:29.640]  world and old world countries that they had control of so we know the exact formulae that
[14:29.640 --> 14:35.720]  they will slightly tweak with their anthropologist and sociologist and behaviorist for the particular
[14:35.720 --> 14:45.320]  country that they launch we know the enemy profile we know their modus operandi we have assessed them
[14:47.720 --> 14:52.040]  and you would think it's a weakness if they're so predictable but see their response is hey
[14:52.040 --> 14:56.120]  the public isn't even conscious show what if you're awake show what if you're aware
[14:57.800 --> 15:01.960]  it's like being one awake person at a sports stadium of lobotomized children
[15:01.960 --> 15:08.840]  you can't even communicate with them you can't get them out of the trance they don't even know what
[15:08.840 --> 15:23.240]  you're talking about they're on the news today saying who could have thought Greece would default
[15:25.080 --> 15:28.840]  they're on the news saying who could have thought ices would suddenly launch attacks
[15:28.840 --> 15:34.920]  in Africa and the Middle East and France
[15:37.080 --> 15:44.120]  terror attacks in France Tunisia and Kuwait we have brutal footage and audio of this i don't
[15:44.120 --> 15:51.480]  even know i'm going to air it our listeners forget who exposed the fact that al-qaeda was
[15:51.480 --> 15:59.560]  synthetic and completely run by western intelligence on 9 11 then i analyze the new al-qaeda and the new
[15:59.560 --> 16:05.080]  syrian state they were building in the last four or five years giving libya as a base to take down
[16:05.080 --> 16:10.520]  africa to al-qaeda giving syria part of it as a base to take down the middle east western
[16:10.520 --> 16:16.760]  governments all financing it we laid out exactly four years ago exactly three years ago exactly
[16:16.760 --> 16:22.760]  two years ago exactly one year ago exactly a month ago over and over again at nauseam
[16:23.960 --> 16:29.400]  that ices is a real terror threat a multi hundred thousand person army recruited and funded by the
[16:29.400 --> 16:34.760]  west with useful idiot bots who actually think they're fighting for quote islam that are going
[16:34.760 --> 16:41.640]  to be allowed to attack the entire western world and the middle east they're meant to take over
[16:41.640 --> 16:46.280]  and conquer the middle east and much of africa as a proxy front for the globalist under Saudi
[16:46.280 --> 16:51.560]  arabia and turkeys control here they're going to attack be repulsed and defeated but that'll
[16:51.560 --> 16:59.720]  be used for the next decade of expanded police state oh alex now says the muslim threats real
[16:59.720 --> 17:05.000]  even though he said for all these years it was synthetic it was always real but it was manufactured
[17:05.880 --> 17:13.960]  now it's not manufactured it's bred in a pin and turned loose like i said if i go to my neighbor
[17:13.960 --> 17:18.760]  and put three rattlesnakes in his bed i didn't bite my neighbor but i'm an accomplice to it
[17:18.760 --> 17:24.280]  i put the rattlesnakes in the bed if i go dump a hundred black widows in your bed
[17:25.000 --> 17:29.000]  and you go and get in there i don't control the black widows i just know what they're going to do
[17:31.640 --> 17:37.960]  if i put you in a pin with 15 starving wolves i don't run the wolves they'd bite my hand too
[17:37.960 --> 17:43.160]  but i control the environment and the paradigm that's the new world order that's what you face
[17:44.520 --> 17:48.520]  they're going to kick folks they will shoot down jet airliners with missiles
[17:48.520 --> 17:54.120]  and the media will sit there and never say they were giving them in the war against syria
[17:54.120 --> 18:02.120]  that in libya bin gazi you heard it all here and i'm not bragging you can learn all this too
[18:02.120 --> 18:06.840]  the mainstream media can learn it but they're not really smart they're not really informed and
[18:06.840 --> 18:12.440]  they read off teleprompters whether it's fox or cnn or msnbc they get up there and they read
[18:12.440 --> 18:17.480]  off the teleprompter they're giving their talking points and they go gee who could have imagined
[18:17.480 --> 18:23.800]  isis would have done this well the west will do something now the west you mean the criminals
[18:23.800 --> 18:28.360]  that run our country who could have imagined that's the headlines i've got them here on the stack
[18:28.360 --> 18:37.320]  no one could see the greece crisis coming no oh no one there have been three so-called bailouts
[18:37.320 --> 18:41.240]  of greece that were really to the bankers that set this up almost all the debt in greece 90 plus
[18:41.240 --> 18:46.280]  percent of it is not the greece's own debt their government signed on in the e u deal
[18:46.280 --> 18:50.760]  and part of the banker bailouts to sign on to all this they've had massive tax increases you name it
[18:51.720 --> 18:58.280]  they're now going into freefall they're meant to implode countries and have them leave the e u
[18:58.280 --> 19:04.040]  and then they're going to form a new global union to quote stabilize the three unions they always
[19:04.040 --> 19:10.360]  meant to create three unions to depress their substates then out of that implosion weld them
[19:10.360 --> 19:17.080]  all together as the fix now how did i know this 20 years ago because i read barry goldwater's book
[19:17.720 --> 19:24.520]  he was in the meetings he exposed it i read the statements of david rockefeller it's all planned
[19:24.520 --> 19:28.120]  i read the opposition to it and i read the people that were for it
[19:29.640 --> 19:33.960]  if i was in a war which i am i would read the enemy's own documents they're so arrogant their
[19:33.960 --> 19:38.280]  battle plans are public and they don't give us their battle plans because they're fake to throw
[19:38.280 --> 19:44.120]  us off or there's dis info in them like the british with their ultra system let the germans know
[19:45.640 --> 19:51.640]  no it's beyond that they are so arrogant they are operating uncloaked attacking us at point
[19:51.640 --> 19:56.840]  blank range when we come back inside the great crisis the world is defenseless against the next

[24:26.680 --> 24:32.920]  told greg palest we're going to fire you if you do any more pieces on this basically he got pulled
[24:32.920 --> 24:39.320]  back from former top federal fraud investigator that went to work for the bbc and in it the imf
[24:39.320 --> 24:45.400]  and world bank were planning to take down to the west next they'd already taken over the third world
[24:45.400 --> 24:51.320]  latin america africa and much of asia through fraud and it talked about how they would then
[24:51.320 --> 24:56.520]  depress economies have the country sign on the debt do bail out after bail out that actually puts
[24:56.520 --> 25:03.080]  the countries in debt to the mega banks when the companies themselves are being bailed out
[25:03.080 --> 25:13.320]  by the countries and the public is so illiterate is the proper word total illiteracy when it comes
[25:13.320 --> 25:19.800]  to basic financial systems but even when you tune into cnbc that's all within the paradigm of the
[25:19.800 --> 25:27.720]  controlled economic order so that itself is not how it really operates and now they're talking about
[25:27.720 --> 25:35.000]  greece could face social unrest soon wilbur ross warrants who could have thought that then they
[25:35.000 --> 25:45.880]  use the civil unrest this is in the imf world bank documents that got leaked bbc they didn't use that
[25:45.880 --> 25:51.560]  unrest that goes on for six months a year two years whatever so that have a savior run for office
[25:51.560 --> 25:57.800]  who then comes in and brings in even more control and they'll do this over and over and over again
[25:57.800 --> 26:05.960]  consolidating power to keep the people poor the european union on friday proposed you can pull this
[26:05.960 --> 26:14.680]  up a vat tax on all tourism in greece to quote pay off their debts now they've already raised taxes
[26:14.680 --> 26:21.640]  so much that it's making it prohibitive to go to greece because there's so many taxes on hotels
[26:21.640 --> 26:28.280]  transportation uh and tourist-related institutions and the government itself said why would you want
[26:28.280 --> 26:35.000]  that as part of your eu system when you know that will stall our economy well remember what they
[26:35.000 --> 26:43.400]  did five years ago in greece and three years ago in greece and two years ago remember they had
[26:43.400 --> 26:48.840]  them raise all these other taxes that didn't help the country cost tax revenues to go down
[26:48.840 --> 26:54.920]  so their debts even got bigger they know that kennedy cut taxes by 50 percent in the general
[26:54.920 --> 27:01.800]  tax bracket tax receipts did what the next year went up over 40 percent what happened the second
[27:01.800 --> 27:10.760]  year they doubled they blew us head off at that point greece debt talks eu chief betrayed and
[27:10.760 --> 27:16.760]  they just found the reuters article go back to that for tv viewers reuters greeks draw the line
[27:16.760 --> 27:25.240]  greek tourism draws line of the sand over tax hikes creditors want greece to pass a v a v at
[27:26.440 --> 27:31.880]  value added tax they also want to scrap tax breaks for island resorts critics say the hikes
[27:31.880 --> 27:36.200]  are counterproductive really tourists warned over greek bank troubles
[27:38.920 --> 27:43.240]  let me read to you what they're doing in greece now now you probably heard this here
[27:43.240 --> 27:46.760]  if you're a regular listener five thousand times i'm not exaggerating i'm sorry this is for new
[27:46.760 --> 27:53.000]  listeners we're trying to save the country and the world the bank runs have started they're not
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.360]  letting people get their money out they're calling for banning cash everything we told you because
[27:58.360 --> 28:05.880]  it's an exact plan red palace wasn't allowed to tell more in his first bbc report he came here
[28:05.880 --> 28:13.800]  no less than 10 times i put it in my book to sent into tyranny you can go read it it's at

[28:24.600 --> 28:28.920]  in fact if somebody find me i didn't think to do this it's sold out years ago but to sit in the
[28:28.920 --> 28:34.840]  tyranny i think some of that bookshelf back there flip it to the end near the ends the warning
[28:34.840 --> 28:40.200]  and the transcripts and the documents on the global plan to bring down the three mega regions
[28:40.200 --> 28:45.720]  and to bring in a world government remember this is before 2008 the book was published in 2002
[28:48.040 --> 28:51.880]  now here are the headlines the world is defenseless against the final
[28:52.920 --> 28:58.200]  does the Freudian slip the world is defenseless against the next financial crisis warrants bank
[28:58.200 --> 29:05.960]  of international settlements london telegraph paul joseph watson greek crisis e you showed contempt
[29:07.240 --> 29:13.560]  for allowing greeks to vote on referendum the europe group has disdain for any elections
[29:14.840 --> 29:19.560]  greece will collapse this week and people will be terrified jim rogers smart guy
[29:21.400 --> 29:26.840]  greece closes banks ahead of referendum a default the debt payment this week could mean greece

[29:37.560 --> 29:40.360]  greece's debt crisis since stocks falling around the globe
[29:42.040 --> 29:45.560]  and then of course my book to sit in the tyranny i'm gonna try to find that the section
[29:46.600 --> 29:52.440]  from 13 years ago where we lay it all out we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:52.440 --> 29:56.200]  Alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.200 --> 30:07.800]  did you know that only six corporations control 90 percent of what millions of americans see here
[30:07.800 --> 30:14.680]  and read every single day it's the illusion of choice think about it the mainstream media is owned
[30:14.680 --> 30:21.080]  by only a handful of mega corporations with vested interests but on the other hand the internet
[30:21.080 --> 30:27.800]  is an interconnected network of billions of sources so you can research information for yourself
[30:27.800 --> 30:34.280]  from multiple sources or you can blindly accept what you hear or read in the mainstream media
[30:34.280 --> 30:40.440]  never questioning what you are being told this gives you a false sense of reality i mean do you

[34:04.280 --> 34:10.520]  slash tv transmission there's some confusion that is not subscription there's a better feed at
[34:10.520 --> 34:18.360]  present planet dot tv it what is subscription is the nightly news the films the ebooks and so much
[34:18.360 --> 34:22.680]  more because a lot of the documentaries and things that are on there that aren't mine i had to pay to
[34:22.680 --> 34:30.920]  be able to put on there so it's 20 years of material then around 15 years and it just gets better and
[34:30.920 --> 34:37.320]  better it's 15 cents a day 20 people can use each membership uh we just charge so that we
[34:37.320 --> 34:42.200]  can have money to fund the platform but it's at cost that's why we used to only let one person
[34:42.200 --> 34:47.560]  use a membership that's bandwidth got cheaper five people 10 people now it's 20 people can use each
[34:47.560 --> 34:52.600]  membership and then if you ever try to log in and can't 20 people are on will praise god
[34:52.600 --> 34:57.560]  get a second membership it's 595 a month and my book the sent into tyranny
[35:00.040 --> 35:06.760]  is on the site and mainly this book which is is a great read it's it's out of been
[35:06.760 --> 35:13.800]  been on a print for about eight nine years world bankers feed off crumbling economies
[35:14.520 --> 35:19.400]  and that's one of the chapters towards the end and it's basically some documents and a transcript
[35:19.400 --> 35:27.720]  of a gregg palace interview on march 4th 2002 and we break down how they were going to bring down
[35:27.720 --> 35:32.200]  the rest of third world then set their sights on engineering a collapse in the west and then they
[35:32.200 --> 35:36.680]  use the collapse claiming that they're the stabilizers and the guys there to the rescue
[35:37.800 --> 35:44.040]  to come in and basically have the people sign their rights away world bankers feed off crumbling
[35:44.040 --> 35:49.720]  economies such an important article at prison planet dot tv in fact we ought to go
[35:51.800 --> 35:53.320]  pull a transcript of this
[35:55.800 --> 35:59.320]  they've got programs online at scribe where you can just pull the text
[35:59.800 --> 36:06.120]  from the book and put into an article at info wars dot com to parallel it to what's happening today
[36:08.120 --> 36:12.600]  and again i don't get up here and show you where we predicted things over and over again to toot
[36:12.600 --> 36:19.880]  our horn it's not hard every time of the last three times really there's been four but three big
[36:19.880 --> 36:26.120]  quote bailouts they've said this will stabilize and fix Greece and all it does is make people start
[36:26.120 --> 36:31.880]  starving on the streets where the country is so dangerous now and in so much squalor now
[36:31.880 --> 36:36.280]  but it was a very safe nice country that more and more tourists aren't going there
[36:36.280 --> 36:42.440]  and the globalists will just do this for a decade until the country totally collapses
[36:42.440 --> 36:46.920]  they'll come in and buy it all up and then stabilize it after with a police state and
[36:46.920 --> 36:54.120]  then tourism will come back but the people will wake up homeless on the island their forefathers
[36:54.120 --> 37:03.480]  populated to paraphrase thomas jefferson if we ever allow central banks to issue and control the
[37:03.480 --> 37:07.960]  currency our children will wake up homeless on the continent their forebearers conquer
[37:10.440 --> 37:14.920]  and so now you got lines of people trying to pull cash just like in the u.s or just like
[37:14.920 --> 37:19.720]  in the eu it's all the same same globalists run it there's less than two percent physical cash
[37:20.600 --> 37:28.600]  for just the money that is in circulation of the people there are hundreds of times derivatives
[37:28.600 --> 37:35.960]  digital money so for every multi thousand dollar or euro out there there's maybe one euro or one
[37:35.960 --> 37:44.040]  dollar in existence no one really knows but the mid 90s we passed the point of three percent cash
[37:44.040 --> 37:48.760]  in the banks for physical deposits last time ron paul was on or it was the time before he talked
[37:48.760 --> 37:55.320]  about it's probably less than one percent no one knows and he was on the banking committee
[37:55.320 --> 38:02.680]  in the house they can't get answers one percent two percent whatever it is
[38:04.360 --> 38:08.200]  think about how dangerous that is and if you go to blumberg they have footage
[38:10.760 --> 38:16.360]  showing the people lined up pulling their cash out and now the banks are saying we're going to
[38:16.360 --> 38:22.280]  stop letting you get your cash out is there any surprise that just a few weeks ago they were
[38:22.280 --> 38:27.080]  pushing in europe to start restricting cash and saying it's for your safety and the rest of it no
[38:27.080 --> 38:32.760]  it's so the globalists can do a bail in as they're saying if this referendum goes through
[38:32.760 --> 38:37.080]  and Greece doesn't sign on to more austerity they'll be quote kicked out of the euro and the
[38:37.080 --> 38:43.480]  globalist banks that set up the euro to take political control from the people to conquer them
[38:43.480 --> 38:50.600]  just like tpp they will go in and they will claw the money directly out of the accounts
[38:50.600 --> 38:52.840]  just like they did in cyprus and other areas
[38:58.040 --> 39:01.960]  i mean the globalist if your quote state or your country doesn't pay a debt
[39:01.960 --> 39:06.280]  they'll go in with sanctions and grab the assets overseas like you're doing to russia
[39:06.840 --> 39:11.960]  and not over debts but because russia is defending its population that's indigenous
[39:11.960 --> 39:18.040]  to eastern ukraine in the Crimea again not saying russia is faultless but
[39:18.040 --> 39:22.920]  they didn't start the war they didn't overthrow ukraine like george soros the same group of bankers
[39:24.120 --> 39:28.280]  and they're now having their assets all over the world seized their companies shut down
[39:28.280 --> 39:32.760]  that americans and brits and germans and other people work in
[39:34.920 --> 39:39.640]  member wiki leaks when they thought assange was trying to fly into germany and other countries
[39:40.680 --> 39:46.200]  and nato would force russian aircraft down to search them that's the new world order folks

[42:06.840 --> 42:15.720]  would not go along with this and knew how dangerous it was 13 years ago and got away at a safe distance
[42:20.520 --> 42:25.560]  the world will be unable to fight the next global financial crash as central banks have
[42:25.560 --> 42:30.360]  used up their ammunition trying to tackle the last crisis but they said it davos three years ago
[42:30.360 --> 42:37.720]  two years ago and this year they have a way to fix it a global emergency authority using the sdr
[42:37.720 --> 42:45.400]  or something like it is a global new digital cash it'll be backed up 10 percent in gold or other

[43:12.440 --> 43:20.600]  they do it the world will be unable to fight the next global financial crash as central banks
[43:20.600 --> 43:25.000]  have used up their ammunition trying to tackle the last crisis the bank of international settlements
[43:25.000 --> 43:32.600]  has warned they're out of ammo protecting us oh my gosh the very private banks that own this

[43:37.560 --> 43:44.600]  noculations i mean this is the devil the so-called central bank of central banks see the top of the
[43:44.600 --> 43:51.320]  pyramid but you're private launched a scathing critique of global monetary policy which they run

[44:02.360 --> 44:06.120]  the so-called central bank of central banks launched a scathing critique of the global
[44:06.120 --> 44:13.160]  monetary policy in its annual report the bis claimed that central banks have backed themselves
[44:13.160 --> 44:18.440]  into a corner after repeatedly cutting interest rates to shore up their economies these low
[44:18.440 --> 44:22.920]  interest rates have in turn filled economic booms encouraged excessive risk taking to set
[44:22.920 --> 44:28.760]  everybody up booms have then in turn debuffed which policy makers have responded to with even lower
[44:28.760 --> 44:35.560]  rates and they come in with their answer which will tell you about more coming up but let's continue
[44:36.760 --> 44:42.040]  new york times who could have imagined i'm going to get to those articles in a moment who could have
[44:42.040 --> 44:49.640]  seen isis attacking oh i wonder who talked about it every day oh as a real threat set up to be a real
[44:49.640 --> 44:55.000]  threat because then they'll save us from the threat just like they're going to save us from this

[45:07.400 --> 45:12.520]  what it is now we're battered by worries that the greek financial crisis would prove contagious
[45:12.520 --> 45:18.200]  and chinese investors endured another topsy turvy session and then it goes over all of it
[45:21.240 --> 45:26.520]  cash withdrawals and hoarding as default looms over greece yeah the conspiracy cooks the last
[45:26.520 --> 45:32.600]  few years in greece started cashing their paychecks so a lot of companies got orders to only let you
[45:32.600 --> 45:38.600]  take automatic transfer so they could take whatever they wanted out and they called them conspiracy
[45:38.600 --> 45:45.000]  theorist and hoarders and but now they're right see being right more than other people's conspiracy
[45:45.000 --> 45:52.920]  theorist cash withdrawals and hoarding as default looms over greece the sun's shown as usual with
[45:52.920 --> 45:57.880]  clouds flooding by the brilliant blue sky above acropolis hotels are mostly full shops old t-shirts
[45:57.880 --> 46:02.840]  and cafes along the narrow alleyways the tourist districts were bustling not for long after the
[46:02.840 --> 46:09.560]  new tourism taxes go in it was a seemingly normal sunday except it was anything but normal
[46:10.360 --> 46:14.200]  for many people on athens it was time to prepare for an approaching storm
[46:15.560 --> 46:21.160]  a short walk from the tourist area a line of people waited to withdraw cash and it goes over it
[46:21.160 --> 46:30.840]  but greece closes banks ahead of referendum upi oh they're having a bank holiday joseph lindsay
[46:30.840 --> 46:38.040]  talks about a holiday it's not that normal holiday you're out water skiing i'm having fun it's a holiday
[46:39.560 --> 46:46.760]  it's a patriot act do do do it's a new freedom initiative it's a affordable care act that doubles
[46:46.760 --> 46:54.920]  and triples prices but it says affordable i'm convinced you can sell the trendy's buckets of
[46:56.600 --> 47:04.120]  horseman or color mix pumpkin pie that had a trendy on the front of it or maybe a man in drag
[47:04.120 --> 47:09.480]  with a mustache that's the coolest thing and uh you do that it's over i don't know why that's

[47:45.720 --> 47:51.160]  referendum on the terms that has been offered for receiving a fresh bailout from creditors
[47:51.160 --> 47:56.440]  which never pays down the debt and they just stopped the crisis for a year and then come back

[54:47.160 --> 54:52.280]  it and i understand europeans are supposed to go home but where are they supposed to go to
[54:52.280 --> 54:58.280]  the north pole and again the leftists then play politics and get everybody in europe
[54:58.280 --> 55:03.080]  just bowing down to the foreigners yes we'll pay for everything yes yes yes well the globalist
[55:03.080 --> 55:12.120]  is just doing it to conquer the countries terror talks steve watson politicians former cia had
[55:12.120 --> 55:19.000]  fb i dhs all ramp up warnings for july 4th and say we've got to give up our rights and they say
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.200]  they believe that terrorists are in american basements that's a quote and attacks are imminent
[55:25.080 --> 55:32.120]  and then when if we do get attacked no one will say why did the government create ices
[55:32.120 --> 55:39.000]  fund them and let them in because there's a suspension of reality here mother arrested
[55:39.000 --> 55:43.480]  charged with child endangerment for letting seven-year-old play in the park well that's nothing
[55:43.480 --> 55:48.360]  compared to the 11-year-old his parents were late getting home till six he got home from 430 from
[55:48.360 --> 55:56.840]  school he was in a gated fenced backyard playing basketball and they took him from his parents
[55:56.840 --> 56:01.320]  and indicted him for child endangerment because they can call anything child endangerment
[56:01.320 --> 56:10.120]  it's amazing but the foreign banks can own jet aircraft and ship the drugs out of the country
[56:10.120 --> 56:19.400]  publicly they can be in the news nobody gets in trouble before i go any further when i tell
[56:19.400 --> 56:24.040]  you stuff selling out we never know what's going to be a bestseller everything we promote and push
[56:24.040 --> 56:29.400]  at info wars life dot com helps funder operations it's the purest most high quality organics we can
[56:29.400 --> 56:34.760]  get a lot of it's just hiding in plain view stuff that people aren't promoting because
[56:34.760 --> 56:39.960]  things always have to be the newest newfangled deal a lot of us just common sense a lot of it is old
[56:40.600 --> 56:46.840]  recipes combined with new technology but the key is the purity and the concentration of it
[56:47.480 --> 56:52.760]  our stuff is concentrated whether it's the colloidal silver or whether it's the liver
[56:52.760 --> 56:59.800]  shield or whether it's a super male vitality or whether it's secret 12 the problem is we
[56:59.800 --> 57:04.760]  don't have the money here to produce a whole bunch and then just sit on it because we never
[57:04.760 --> 57:11.880]  know the public's not fickle you just can't judge the public's what they're going to be buying
[57:11.880 --> 57:17.080]  for some reason liver shield sold out looks like five to six weeks told you that was happening
[57:17.080 --> 57:22.680]  occupower sold out uh it could be eight weeks till we have that child ease could be two months till

[57:55.000 --> 58:01.480]  complex to go in on the market contracts you got a bid to try to get these aggregates that are
[58:01.480 --> 58:06.920]  very rare and by rare deep earth iodine's not rare the clean stuff is and then most people
[58:06.920 --> 58:12.760]  aren't going to drill you know five ten million dollar drilling operations to go 12 000 feet to
[58:12.760 --> 58:19.080]  get it i mean it cost millions of dollars so that's why it's hard to get because you gotta find the
[58:19.080 --> 58:24.840]  weirdo companies that are out drilling in the right area that will go for this i mean it's it's
[58:24.840 --> 58:28.760]  it's finite stuff because people aren't drilling for it we're the weirdos that you know understand

[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:38.440]  all right i started hyperventilating a bit in the last segments
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:47.880]  because it is mind blowing to watch what we've known is coming for a very long time
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:54.760]  the next phase of the globalist takeover and i will tell you
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:58.440]  it is surreal
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:11.080]  to watch the autocratic globalist who's done what they're now doing to europe
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:17.960]  to now do what they're doing in europe to so many other countries and to know it's criminal
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.320]  to know it's premeditated but because they fly around and jet helicopters and
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:30.760]  150 million dollar jets and and live in palaces and are guarded by men in black uniforms
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:33.080]  everyone just feels like they're untouchable gods
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.480]  who can just get away with whatever they want
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:49.640]  and so much of ruling populations was always about that being in the big fancy palace with
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:55.480]  the drums and the horns and being behind the big armored gates and the biggest toughest men
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:04.280]  in the fanciest uniforms with their sharp shiny spears and swords guarding you and some autocratic
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:14.920]  elites wanted prosperous populations and kept taxes low and
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:21.400]  and renaissance came in different parts of societies and histories and different kings
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:24.360]  were known as the just or the ideal king
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:33.880]  but those were the minority in most centralized systems the enforcers of the king even of the
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:38.760]  king or queen wasn't a bad person set up their own little private empires
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:47.800]  and built societies based on oppression and based on gangsterism so the world is turning away
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:54.840]  from the renaissance economy that we never truly embraced or attained but nevertheless our course
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:03.400]  has been turned from that pole star in another direction to hell i'd rather go that direction
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:14.440]  we're rapidly being pulled into a big economic cultural spiritual medical black hole based on
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:22.120]  lies based on distortion where you're only given a place at the table if you work against
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:29.720]  what's wholesome and good because instinctively they want to bring down what's wholesome and
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.640]  good even though they feed off of it because they're jealous of it and they're diametrically
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:38.360]  opposed to it and they have historical and genetic memories
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:47.480]  that the good has defeated them over and over again when i say them i mean corrupt people
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:54.600]  throughout history and all the same and that's why they argue when i talk about genetics i don't
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:59.560]  mean a black bloodline or a white bloodline or an asian bloodline but within blacks asians whites
[01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:08.120]  whatever everybody knows that you you can say oh no don't get that doxin it comes from really
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:13.400]  mentally ill biters that's really a screwed up breeder they got problems oh this breeder is
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:20.040]  wonderful nice sweet smart dogs well it's the same thing with humans you've got a race between good
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:24.840]  loving creators who just want to be healthy and happy and care about others and who don't think
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:33.000]  about power and people that do want the power and who crave it and who aren't going to let you go
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.320]  work nine to five and put your kids through college and then go out to the lake cottage on the weekend
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.680]  they're going to destroy your world because they're going to conquer you because they know
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:48.360]  that things are going to get so bad you're going to finally wake up and get together and bring them
[01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:55.800]  down and so they're there working always working when we come back i'll give the number out and

[01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:08.200]  was arrested by police and charged with child endangerment after she let her seven-year-old
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:15.080]  daughter play unsupervised in a park only a few hundred feet from their home nicole jensen said that
[01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:21.960]  police asked her to accompany them to the station because her child was outside unsupervised and
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:27.160]  wouldn't you know it it was a nosy neighbor who called the cops after seeing the child alone in
[01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:33.480]  the park it has now become the norm for americans to panic and call the police if they see a child
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:39.560]  playing in a park even though jensen can see the park from her porch and requires that her kids check
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:45.080]  in with her every hour well it wasn't enough instead of walking the girl one minute to her home the
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:51.880]  cops took the child into custody the case has been deferred to the dhhs and jensen says she will go to

[01:08:07.880 --> 01:08:18.360]  war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network the collapse of greece has been designed
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:26.360]  for over a decade the eu was set up according to the founders of the eu to be a system to destroy
[01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:33.000]  national sovereignty and bankrupt the individuals down to the family level to consolidate power
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:38.840]  and control this fourth or fifth depending on how you look at it so-called bailout of greece
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:46.680]  is mainly for debts owed by greece because they signed on to prop up the eu and onto the larger
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:53.960]  eu wide debts do they have big pension funds do they have some problems certainly but there
[01:08:53.960 --> 01:09:02.200]  shouldn't be an eu system trying to trump what greece can do and now they have bank runs and
[01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:07.160]  now they've shut the banks down and they're calling it a holiday and they say oh it's not to stop bank
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:21.240]  runs even though they're already happening you're allowed to withdraw 66 euros a day until we close
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:29.480]  it and the bank holidays been announced for tomorrow 66 dollars a day or it's 60 dollars 66 euros is
[01:09:29.480 --> 01:09:34.280]  what it calculates out to this is their plan it's why they want to get rid of cash where you can't
[01:09:34.280 --> 01:09:39.640]  even use it because then they can tax your accounts do bail ins control everything you do
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:46.520]  and social engineer to a level never before seen and the technocratic bankers like bloom burger always
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.640]  saying we just really need to be able to decide what you buy and what you do they say all this with
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:56.840]  a straight face and then our economic system will work if we can just get rid of any underground
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:05.080]  economy make you only go to big box stores ban farmers markets make you grow gmo and the eu
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.720]  was set up first now the american union was set up by stealth under trade deals that are secret
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:16.120]  and now they're setting up the asian union under the tpp which we have the internal documents from
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:23.800]  and is just that the merger of the three super unions they're already merging the atlantic union
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:29.800]  right now with it and the atlantic union is the eu and the american union this is just an
[01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:46.600]  incredible time to be alive greece closes banks ahead of referendum upi 800 259 9231 800 259 92 31
[01:10:46.600 --> 01:10:52.840]  is the toll free number we're talking about greece world financial consolidation of power
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:58.040]  will this be the big global meltdown coming up this winter or early next year it may be
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.760]  or will it just be another global crisis that they engineer to get even more power and more
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:15.720]  bailouts while blaming it on greece 800 259 92 31 and then coming up putin urges all to fight
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:23.320]  isis group and back as syria's Assad who's been fighting al-qaeda and now isis we're going to
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:29.080]  be breaking that down we're also going to look at the aclu now not supporting religious freedom
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:37.960]  of speech saying restrict it um see they only used an open society to where we accepted all
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:44.040]  this quote alternative stuff now we're not going to be tolerated no matter what your view is don't
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:48.920]  believe in man-made global warming don't want to pay al gore attacks boom you're in trouble
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:57.720]  don't want to um hire a trainee to be your catholic uh school teacher boom you're shut down
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:01.560]  and we're not joking don't want to have a catholic church or your protest church pay for
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:07.720]  abortions boom you're shut down this is the opposite of tolerance it's the big communal system
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:13.720]  it's the great tyranny you have a right to put on a dress
[01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:21.880]  but you do not have a right to not have foreign banks destroy your country this is the great joke
[01:12:21.880 --> 01:12:28.200]  of social engineering where they made being trendy the new religion and now people it's
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:33.960]  perfect because they can change the dogma day to day hour to hour with the new accepted reality
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:41.160]  whatever that may be and so they only with a quasi puritanical nation like the us that was
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:48.520]  really always radical and wild right under the surface they make it sex and quote deviance
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:55.320]  to be the bait so that we accept whatever the new changes are and now we've opened the door up to
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:01.320]  whatever they want it's politically incorrect to let your 11-year-old play basketball in the
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:06.360]  backyard you'll be arrested you let your seven-year-old daughter in your small town run across as you
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:11.080]  watch her out the window and play at the park like I did I used to go to my grandparents house
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:16.600]  it was in Hyde Park in Austin and I'd be six seven years old and I'd not stand with them
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:23.080]  there in the summer and I'd run across the street you guys look up the name of the park in Austin
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:29.080]  in Hyde Park it'll it'll pop in my head in a minute I never got arrested my parents never got
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:35.560]  arrested I never got the CPS taking me away what changed in America it wasn't the crime went up
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:44.440]  when I was a me lad you know when I was like a 1980 81 six seven years old playing at the park
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:52.120]  across the street from grandma's house I don't know if it's shite park I forget I could I could call
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:14:04.440]  my mom what changed how did it change I mean I grew up on a golf course in Rockwall Texas
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.880]  we moved out there when I was about six and I'd ran around all day you know when I was not at school
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:16.680]  with my friends but we'd drag lumber off and then climb up a tree and you know off in the woods
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:23.240]  to try to build a fort this is the domestication and the takeover turning us into a bunch of
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:28.840]  mindless idiots that if you say it's racist we want to ban it or accept government-run healthcare
[01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:35.560]  or you're not trendy people will go along with it in fact speaking of that the article's up on

[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:04.920]  and we're going to put up a new American flag over the capital to signify the new world order but
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:09.320]  we just needed some more signatures thanks for supporting the new American flag we're pulling
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:14.280]  down the confederate flag and I'll back up to that last guy that that that fella is the quintessential
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:19.800]  modern tough guy trendy there's different types of trendies hundreds of different variants but
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:26.040]  just notice how to act tough those are gonna go yeah and that's what our nation is it's just a
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:31.960]  bunch of guys walking around acting tough and they don't want to know what's going on they just want
[01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:39.480]  to look cool to other people and put on a front but if you look at these guys eyes every time
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:48.120]  they just have this weak look at them it's so pathetic and he signs it to ban the American
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:54.680]  flag seven out of ten did here it is orders to basically ban the old American flag and
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:59.480]  we're going to put up a new American flag over the capital to signify the new world order but
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:03.880]  we just needed some more signatures thanks for supporting the new American flag we were pulling
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:09.400]  down the confederate flag in a lot of cities to end the era of racism and president obama has
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:15.880]  suggested that we issue a new American flag together to signify the new unified america
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:24.280]  something with a pyramid and uh like a rainbow pyramid or something it looks really cool
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:31.160]  but we still need a few more signatures to uh sort of yeah to to signify the unity in the new
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:38.920]  world order uh print birthed in a signature it's a new american flag for the new world order the
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:45.880]  old yeah signature there the old stars and stripes just don't sit right with a lot of people and so
[01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:53.560]  we're gonna be banning the old american flag and the new flag will have like a pyramid with like uh
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:58.920]  a rainbow stripes and it looks really cool so i appreciate your supporting that thank you
[01:17:59.960 --> 01:18:05.960]  a lot of people are we want to take down the confederate flag to sort of stop with the racism
[01:18:05.960 --> 01:18:11.960]  and a lot of people feel the american flag is offensive to the minorities and some of the
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:18.040]  immigrants so we're trying to issue a new flag for the new america but we need a few more signatures
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:25.400]  here just uh i'm all for the red white blue man schools everywhere they're signing our petition
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:31.240]  to issue a new american flag for the new america you know the confederate flags are coming down to
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:39.720]  end the era of racism and it's time to implement a new american flag for the new america you just
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:43.640]  say something's trendy and that's what it looks correct they go for getting some signatures
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:49.800]  here print birthed in a signature i'm gonna say that mindless feeling stars and stripes
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:58.040]  represent the old world uh imperialistic america and this petition's going to implement the new

[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:24.600]  money-changing institutions would learn that they could issue more receipts for what the actual gold
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:30.040]  or silver was in their vaults and the current Rothschild family started doing that about 400
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:36.920]  years ago in germany and became the dominant banking family in the world well now the globalists
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:41.400]  have come out with derivatives and things that don't even have any connection to reality it's not
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:47.480]  like you have say a ton of gold and you've put out loans backed up for 10 tons of gold that was the
[01:24:47.480 --> 01:25:00.360]  old rule 10 to 1 factional reserve banking now it's a thousand to one or more truly mind boggling
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:06.840]  and so their answer is a global government as the new bubble and the final bubble
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:11.000]  because it's never meant to come back after that there's going to be a war against humanity

[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:46.040]  hi alex welcome can you hear me hear me alex okay don't you think it's sort of fishy alex
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:50.360]  that all this demonization or russia and glad we're Putin yet we're still going on
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:57.240]  state missions together don't you think that's a little fishy i know some people are saying
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:04.440]  that this is all staged and i know that the west had a deal with russia and the carney
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:11.400]  endowment to fight hitler i know our government helped put the bolsheviks in in 1917 that's all public
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:18.200]  and and if you're a new listener that's mainline history maybe one in 500 people knows it but
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:22.280]  it's mainline history our government with the british financed the takedown with his ours
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:27.640]  and the nightmare that was bolsheviks but we're really fighting them over ukraine
[01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:33.720]  there really is a split with russia putin really did arrest a bunch of the oligarchs
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:41.960]  i know putin represents a big russian mafia kgb power bloc that decided they could be more
[01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:48.360]  powerful not under communism but under quasi capitalism i judge a tree by its fruits though
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:53.480]  they have youth camps trying to get men and women to get together and get married they
[01:26:54.040 --> 01:26:59.080]  they are trying to tell people to have children uh they get on tv and say the globalists are
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:03.720]  carrying out eugenics against their country i know a lot of the russian leadership because
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:08.760]  i've confirmed this and it's come out in the news there listen to this show uh that they really
[01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:15.240]  like ron poll so i think there's a battle for the heart and soul of russia right now um but that's
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:21.240]  a very complex question you raise uh but i just think that there's a takedown of russia happening
[01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:27.240]  right now an attempt like like of course there's backroom deals with china as well but the globalists
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:32.680]  do battle with each other and i think there are three major power blocks the chinese the russians
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:36.440]  and the anglo-american establishment but the anglo-americans being a dominant group what do you
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:43.400]  think yeah i think that uh i mean i want to believe that or putin i'm hoping he's turned
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:51.080]  against the new old order you know and uh but still one way back somebody and i i was in a
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:55.880]  john burch society and know what a whole lot of all this stuff then the lab john burch society
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:28:02.040]  their website said vladimir putin still a comment that's what they say so but still we got to keep
[01:28:02.040 --> 01:28:06.600]  our eyes open because there's always a chance of a double cross valley these guys you know that
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:09.960]  they'll paint one picture and stab you in the back with another so you got we got to keep our eyes
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:15.400]  open at this oh i totally agree with you and listen russia is not invading us russia is not
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:19.880]  trying to take my guns russia is not opening my borders russia is not trying to bring down greece
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:24.680]  right now i mean egypt just sided with russia because our government throughout their government
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:30.440]  that was you know pro religious freedom and and pro stability and put al qaeda basically in charge
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:36.600]  so our government is the worst thing the modern world's ever seen because it's not our government
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.760]  and that's basically where i'm coming from i just don't want to have a war with russia
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:44.040]  doesn't mean i choose the side of russia great questions great comments
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.760]  see i want to go to more calls but this is such a complex issue i'm going to come back from break
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:54.840]  go to ben grandmother wild chris and then we're going to go to our guests we'll be with us at 40
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:29:02.920]  after it'll be with us 40 minutes for the next hour and we'll cover the waterfront with him
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:10.920]  he's a smart fellow state department random 7277 freedom from war
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:17.960]  is a global disarmament treaty that was never ratified but that were under via unesco which
[01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:23.080]  we did ratify so they couldn't get us ratified that's we just said well we'll we'll ratify the
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:29.720]  unesco treaty that then puts us under unesco to begin with so there's many ways to skin a cat
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:35.000]  that and in that it says they're preparing the us for the more comfortable merger with the
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:40.840]  soviet union under a global government now i don't know if they're still following that old plan
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:48.760]  all i know is they're trying to start a war with russia and they're overthrowing countries
[01:29:48.760 --> 01:30:00.120]  that border it that's not smart the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network

[01:33:54.760 --> 01:34:00.280]  internationalism is how they sold globalism in the 50s but it was just globalism
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:05.800]  there are true forms of internationalism to get around globalism because the globalists
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:12.760]  are internationalists to be outside of their own system so those are two different things but they
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:21.560]  interlock and now they're turning radical islam loose all over the world but saying it's politically
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:27.320]  incorrect to criticize it even though you're going to lose your freedom in the name of staying safe
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:35.480]  from the very threat they engineered and now grease is in designed free fall going into their
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:41.800]  fourth quote bailout and nothing ever fixes it because there's too much debt
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:51.960]  the system is designed to fail into the next system let's go to grandmother in washington
[01:34:51.960 --> 01:34:59.400]  wants to talk about grease and the bond market go ahead welcome hey elix sovereign grandmother
[01:34:59.400 --> 01:35:06.040]  southwest washington my my question is a little complicated i have three parts to it i'd appreciate
[01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:12.280]  a chance to get them all out and this relates to the survivability of a very large segment
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:18.360]  of the american population which is the retirement community over the weekend the head of pimp co the
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:25.400]  world's biggest holder of bonds which by the way is the main financial instrument which props up
[01:35:25.400 --> 01:35:31.160]  retirement investments put out this uh he this guy put out this almond is warning about whether
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:38.920]  or not the world should let greek up out grease off out um meanwhile for quite a while on your
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:45.480]  show and all over including recently a bunch of different thought leaders have identified the
[01:35:45.480 --> 01:35:52.440]  the grease the idea of grease opting out is very possibly could be the trigger for the imminent
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:58.920]  collapse of the bond market which we all know is coming okay so yes ma'am that's what we've been
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:08.760]  saying for several years yeah absolutely and the question is the question is our is this large
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:14.840]  segment of the american population who has the most wealth you know where we have the greatest
[01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:19.800]  transfer of wealth happening in the history of the world probably yes the plan is to to create a
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:26.360]  global crisis to take and nationalize globalize your pension funds your bank accounts your stocks
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:32.520]  and your bonds and have them managed by an international secret body so that so that it's
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:37.400]  it's proprietary so that it's safe and official and kosher it has to be secret like tpp and you're
[01:36:37.400 --> 01:36:43.960]  like wait secret is not kosher secret is not good they're like no this is upside down world
[01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:48.600]  and then they will take control of all your wealth and manage it for you while taking
[01:36:48.600 --> 01:36:54.840]  large chunks of it and by the time uh you get ready to retire or by the time you're halfway
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:59.400]  through retirement you'll have nothing left but then if you criticize it you're going to be called
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:06.360]  an insurgent in a local combat group under global control have to drop by and deal with you well
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:14.040]  minister counting on the bond bubble to fund this thing and the bond bubble is getting ready to collapse
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:20.600]  the bond bubble directly links to the survivability of a very large percentage of the population
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:27.480]  that depends upon their investment if you aren't living on your investments on your quote retirement
[01:37:27.480 --> 01:37:35.480]  like i am millions of other people are you can't quite appreciate this point so what i'm saying
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:42.680]  is if the bond market is going to collapse that is the equivalent of confiscation of our retirement
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:48.120]  income don't worry they're not going to do that they're going to only take part of it then they're
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:51.960]  going to jack it back up and save it then they're going to take it again and they're going to save
[01:37:51.960 --> 01:37:57.720]  it again until they maneuver everybody into them being in full control then they're going to take
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:04.520]  large chunks of it at a time but people will be so conditioned to it going back up like 2008
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:09.160]  when they finally drop the hammer people are going to submit this is social engineering
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:16.520]  they've done this in argentina and mexico and nigeria and basically everywhere else and in
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:23.880]  europe and here before but but they're doing it all out this time and so that's why i had you
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:28.760]  may be a new listener i'm not sure because i mean i understand you're concerned and and you sound
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:33.880]  like you almost think i'm not being serious enough about this believe me i am we had uh what two
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:40.840]  guests on last week max keiser and dr paul craig roberts uh both very smart financial people on
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:47.400]  this very subject uh and and we've we've got nomi prince former managing director of goldman sacks
[01:38:47.400 --> 01:38:52.520]  who's been warning about this since 2002 she's coming on tomorrow and we've got congressman
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:58.200]  former congressman ron paul on thursday who's warning of imminent collapse uh last week in a
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:05.560]  video he put out he'll be joining us so we're trying to stop this from happening um but
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:10.840]  they don't plan to take your your bonds right away they may let the bond market collapse at first
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:16.040]  and drive down a bunch of other stocks and things so they can buy some of them up but they ride
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:23.640]  the the the pyramid up and down up and down they ride these things to consolidate control
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:30.840]  i'm not going to give you advice on what i think you should do but certainly raising the alarm bell
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:38.520]  does some good the problem is the public is so financially illiterate that the general public
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:44.920]  just doesn't even understand they're going to welcome the nationalization of retirement funds
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:51.800]  they're going to welcome it and so the question is how do you educate people who will sign petitions
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:57.240]  to ban the american flag and who want to have civil war generals dug up and thrown out of
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:03.240]  cemeteries that's what they're obsessed with right now that and men saying they're women
[01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:08.520]  how do you communicate with people that mind controlled living in that scrambled of a world
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:19.480]  i think there is a um divide and conquer a tactic that isn't i i rarely hear discussed
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:26.840]  anywhere we've talked about black white male female so on but when i don't hear just
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:36.680]  generational generational and the thing is this is why i called sure plenty of people who aren't
[01:40:36.680 --> 01:40:44.120]  dependent upon their monthly retirement check will agree to restructuring the whole shebang
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:50.440]  you got it dumping social security that's the people that have jobs that are a working age
[01:40:50.440 --> 01:40:57.960]  they are capable of working what about the huge chunk i'm not talking a small number of people who
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:04.520]  are dumbed down by the drugs that they're taking on one on top of another we're the most drug
[01:41:04.520 --> 01:41:09.720]  generation the vietnam generation is the most drugged generation in the history of the planet
[01:41:09.720 --> 01:41:18.680]  they can't even think we are about to get extracted you are i appreciate your call
[01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.800]  uh you know having the instinct to not want to be a slave to not have your retirement stolen
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:30.440]  is a good one this is a very complex issue to say the least yes we have talked about generational
[01:41:30.440 --> 01:41:37.720]  um but probably not enough it's one of the biggest playing the working population off
[01:41:37.720 --> 01:41:42.840]  against the retired population pointing out how many of these pension funds especially
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:50.520]  public are untenable i mean there are hundreds of employees just in california and a news
[01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:55.960]  article i read a few years ago making above five hundred thousand dollars a year
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:01.800]  city managers making eight hundred thousand dollars a year in small towns
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:10.520]  and in their pension they're going to get two hundred three hundred four hundred thousand
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:19.400]  dollars a year and people ask well that is untenable what they've done is they've mixed
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:25.720]  all that fraud all those fraudulent pensions in with the guy that worked at the water plant for
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:32.440]  thirty five years and is going to get a pension painting 50 60 grand a year and he paid into
[01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:38.440]  that it just got matched by the county but then the county invested in derivatives that were scam
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:42.680]  so that's going to go belly up on those bonds you're absolutely right then they're going to
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:48.680]  look at the general population and say prop this up with new taxes or grandma isn't going to get her
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:56.360]  pension and people are going to get sick of it after they've done five six seven rounds of new
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:05.560]  taxes and bail ins to prop it up and then finally they'll take it all they know how to they they do
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:09.240]  this in other countries over and over again we've been watching it in grace they will do it here
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:11.480]  and how do you fix that
[01:43:11.480 --> 01:43:19.800]  that we have a spoiled addled population in the west we were so free we became filthy rich
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:23.880]  fraud got involved no one wants to give anything up
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:33.000]  and so the elite are just going to take everything build a police state to protect it
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:38.120]  and they will be above the law and you will be poor that is the new world order in fact you will
[01:43:38.120 --> 01:43:42.680]  starve to death if they can have their way they want you dead they believe it's good to bankrupt you
[01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:51.240]  they believe it's good to have you in squalor because you don't contribute anything and some
[01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:57.160]  people say well i guess that's true what do any of us contribute now you're in the mindset of the
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:03.960]  globalist where we're losers we're fallen we're failed the elite are in control so they're the
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:10.840]  only ones that are enlightened and they're going to save the earth from humanity while getting
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:15.240]  life extension technologies and power for themselves that's a nice script and they've written it
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:23.240]  that's how british royalty a hundred and sixty five years ago underwrote this whole system the full
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:29.560]  might of the british empire was put behind this plan you're now seeing today and i gotta say
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:36.280]  bravo it's a lot more wild than any james bond movie
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:46.840]  what was that new film i took my son to see it it's with the british secret service guy
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:53.400]  in the agency that's so secret what's it called it's the kingsman yeah the kingsman i
[01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:57.000]  went and saw the kingsman months ago when it came out and we're going to our guest
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:06.840]  he'll be with us for the whole next hour and in it there's a billionaire who's convinced all the
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:12.840]  other major billionaires including british secret service to use a wavelength programming system
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:18.840]  which darpa actually has similar systems to use devices smart devices to transmit a wavelength
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:24.680]  to make everybody kill each other now really they don't do that they just transmit stuff that gives
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:35.000]  you cancer but they're doing it to save the earth from humanity and they have to tell you this in
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:39.720]  all these movies now because this is revelation of the method because this show and others were
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:44.440]  finally getting people to listen and to understand the real paradigm and so now it doesn't have the
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:48.520]  effect of being new for the public but they actually go out and find out it's true it's just oh
[01:45:48.520 --> 01:45:59.480]  that's a movie that's like the kingsman because see when you're unconscious they just want to
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:03.800]  keep you unconscious and so as long as the average person says hey this movie's waking people up or
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:10.280]  this other movie's waking them up no that's if you're in a conscious awake state then you get upset
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:20.520]  but when you're unconscious in a mesmerized state this is hypnosis one-on-one and you just get
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:25.880]  shown all this it just gets you ready zombie apocalypse total collapse of society mass murder
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:29.880]  death humans are bad the future doesn't need us the world's gonna be better without us all these
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:35.240]  tv shows all these movies fiction nonfiction the novels the books the kids being taught guilt
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:39.800]  human guilt the ultimate political correctness not how do we fix it how do we make it better
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.840]  no no no humans are failed dumb us down get rid of us
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:48.680]  it's the cheaters way to get full control
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:55.640]  that's where we're going we're joined by Lionel of Lionel media constitutional lawyer former

[01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:35.320]  just all this craziness isis attacks
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:41.240]  where should we begin lionel i mean what's front and center on your radar do you want to speak to
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:47.880]  the balkanization of the generations and what i was just getting into because they're getting us
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:54.760]  ready for another round of being held hostage to these shadowy global banks the bank of international
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:59.960]  settlements is going to say from a secret meeting what we do there are boss how many more trillions
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:04.040]  of us taxpayer money will go over to europe to prop something up that's meant to fail
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:10.520]  sucker born every minute i mean where do we start lionel you know it's funny uh alex you you there's
[01:48:10.520 --> 01:48:19.080]  so much just listening on hold to being on hold is is just enormous you know i i cannot begin
[01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:26.280]  first of all without mentioning the role of the mainstream media as potentiating our delusion
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:31.160]  you know one of the problems they say we're taking let's say diazepam and alcohol or mixing
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:38.920]  certain drugs is that alcohol potentiates certain drugs well the media potentiate our ignorance
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:44.440]  and what they do is like a baby bird is fed by his mother the mother takes a worm
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:51.080]  choose it digest it and then gives it back to the baby bird and a form the baby bird can handle
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:58.440]  based upon its own youth and based and novelty in essence well that's what our media are doing
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:05.240]  right now with all that is going on in the world here in new york we had yesterday a gay gay pride
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:10.920]  day which is terrific and i think very frankly personally everybody should be allowed to marry
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:17.720]  anybody they want who's an adult unfortunately the supreme court case had nothing to do with
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:22.680]  that it actually hurts the cause and then we had recently you probably haven't carried this but here
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:29.080]  locally in new york we have these the second of these escapees who was gunned down by the police
[01:49:29.080 --> 01:49:36.840]  we're talking about that and then we have the confederate flag again chewed up predigested
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:44.520]  worms being fed to us by the media meanwhile alex they look to greece and they say you know this is
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:54.680]  a rather arcane and recognized bonds and imf and bailouts and that's greece that's some third world
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:50:00.680]  greece the the backbone of democracy but that's greece it's never going to happen to us i don't
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:07.080]  have time for that i'd rather talk to about katelyn janer or confederate flags i'd rather
[01:50:07.080 --> 01:50:14.360]  take history alex and revise it i'd rather take a subject namely confederate flags we've never
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:20.840]  talked about it's the perennial subject now much like team mascots are whether the redskins is a
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:27.400]  racist term and we just talk about it because it creates the delusion and the illusion and the
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:35.080]  perception we're a part of something and we're involved when in fact it's predigested nothing
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:41.240]  because the real issue the real frightening things involve issues alex that are too many people
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:49.880]  are came and wrecked that's right it's cold-blooded preplanned diversion while earth shattering huge
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:56.840]  events are taking place build up for war with russia global depression bank runs and then i hear
[01:50:56.840 --> 01:51:01.240]  this too why do i care about greece well because you're about to bail them out or why do i care
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:04.920]  about derivatives because you've been signed on to them or why do i care about the stock market
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:10.440]  because the company you work for is able to pay you because of stock there's this super selfishness
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:16.120]  too built into the average person not everybody but a large portion a large minority where they
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:21.320]  think their selfishness is a shield when in truth it's that selfishness that brings them down i want
[01:51:21.320 --> 01:51:26.440]  you to speak to that but separately i'm a libertarian so what does it really do have a bunch of trial
[01:51:26.440 --> 01:51:31.880]  lawyers now are going to be able to get you know two women or two men's money when they get divorces
[01:51:31.880 --> 01:51:37.480]  with each other right it's the fact of what is our gross domestic product obsessing over the redskins
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:43.000]  obsessing over confederate flags obsessing over transgender people when that's not our gdp that's
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.280]  not we've been known for for science for developing things for invention for being trailblazers
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:56.280]  they're giving us a mentally dysfunctional balkanized fight with each other tower of babel
[01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:03.480]  that only only makes it worse it's so cold-blooded and you're a constitutional lawyer i don't know
[01:52:03.480 --> 01:52:09.880]  your view yet but i'll give you mine it's not the fed's place to be saying what the state should be
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:15.640]  doing concerning this and it's like all these others it's it's like the fed saying states can't
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:22.200]  legalize marijuana it's the same deal let me ask you this alex let's assume that the state
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:26.760]  were to tell let's say the state of texas if you don't have a child within one year let's
[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:31.320]  think there's a law this pack you don't have a child within one year of your of your marriage of
[01:52:31.320 --> 01:52:38.920]  your nuptials your marriage is therefore void because after all marriage is about children
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:41.960]  and if you're not having children either because you elect to have children you can't have children
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:45.400]  you're too old to have children i would say that's wrong and for those that don't know it's already
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:52.200]  happening right well guess what you've disagreed to the federal government commenting on what is it
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:57.800]  isn't permissible under state law you see i believe in gay marriage but i don't necessarily believe
[01:52:57.800 --> 01:53:02.440]  that this is a right vehicle i believe a woman should have the right to an abortion i'm sorry
[01:53:02.440 --> 01:53:06.520]  but i don't think we're all against weight is a way to do this i think this fiction of privacy
[01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:11.400]  that harry blackman carved out of nowhere is a problem then you have this intellectually
[01:53:11.400 --> 01:53:17.320]  disingenuous nonsense alex you have justice roberts who the day before basically upheld obama
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:22.600]  care using i don't even want to call it a fiction whether with all due respect to fiction but use
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:29.720]  this unique aspect this new vector of judicial activism to basically give a six three majority
[01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:38.840]  for obama care and then the next day he railed against judicial activism who said how dare we
[01:53:38.840 --> 01:53:43.800]  the supreme court act as sure well undoubtedly they use the gay marriage thing as a political
[01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:48.840]  football a political toy to throw back and forth but specifically on obama care then
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:54.600]  i mean i'm no constitutional lawyer but it's not equally applied uh it's run by foreign groups to
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:59.640]  it makes you buy a product i mean it's just the ultimate screw job and it sets the precedent
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:05.880]  on so many fronts what is your view of obama care well obama care under this you see well let me
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:13.160]  let me let me go back my view of obama care is one thing the constitution and the supreme court
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:19.320]  can be tailored to make anything fit anything this idea that scalia came up with that you could look
[01:54:19.320 --> 01:54:25.000]  through this prism of either judicial activism or or our non-judicial activism but originalism
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:31.240]  or strict construction and you can apply this algorithm that gives you the correct constitutional
[01:54:31.240 --> 01:54:38.040]  interpretation is nonsense the constitution is so silent as to the air force even how many
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:44.360]  justices there are in the supreme court it can be anything you want but you see this has been
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:53.640]  portrayed to the american people the theme as it's about freedom and love and which is great
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:54:59.800]  but you don't even need the constitution to do that let me explain in 1967 alex there was a case
[01:54:59.800 --> 01:55:07.000]  loving against texas which basically um overruled statutes which made it a felony for there to be
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:14.600]  miscegenation black and white people marrying and they will often use that as an example to explicate
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:23.000]  to to to bolster this decision that was different because that penalized people criminally for for
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:28.280]  blacks and whites marrying but not whites and asians or any other race it was a different
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:35.960]  vehicle they missed the point this past week we have and you were the one who before anybody
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:42.520]  talked about this let me just i have to mention this horrible case of charleston yet again alex
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:48.680]  the thing to me that always is forgotten this is somewhat of a bit different subject but not really
[01:55:49.320 --> 01:55:57.000]  we will know everything about guns that were used what he said what he uttered what he wore
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:04.280]  what he facebook we will never look at perhaps any type of psychotropic or psychiatric medication
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:13.080]  this to me is absolutely amazing in that it shows you how a feat and how impugnant and how
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:20.360]  really a testicular it's not a lack of a better word the trial lawyer's bar is because do you
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:28.280]  know what would happen if we could turn the issue of whether a known medication that is in the public
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:35.640]  commerce was responsible for taking otherwise normal people and making them homicidal this
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:41.640]  would be a product's liability a boondoggle the likes of which you've never seen exactly but
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:47.000]  they want to blame the guns so there is a mainstream media conspiracy of silence by
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:51.880]  omitting the truth but getting back to the whole supreme court issue i mean i think what you're
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:55.640]  getting at here and i agree with it is the government shouldn't be involved the institution of
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:57:00.440]  religion first amendment it shouldn't be involved in the first amendment because it has no jurisdiction
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:05.880]  and it shouldn't be involved with who you live with or who you marry clearly it's unconstitutional
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:12.280]  it's not the jurisdiction in my view of the federal government to even be involved in it is that
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:16.600]  an accurate statement in your view absolutely in the state of new york where i am right now
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:22.920]  first cousins can marry in the state of new york a person can marry his adopted child
[01:57:22.920 --> 01:57:29.640]  now those are the laws of new york new york for better or for worse decided we're going to do this
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:36.680]  texas may allow the age of 16 virginia may allow 14 you may have a variety of parameters
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:43.080]  that the people of a particular state find to be within the the the rubric of what and that's why
[01:57:43.080 --> 01:57:47.080]  we have states and it gives you choice and if you don't like it move another state now why
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:52.280]  even have states with this big imperial government floating around and then it takes its orders from
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:57.080]  secret bodies like the tpp i want to come back well i don't get your take on the tpp i want to
[01:57:57.080 --> 01:58:03.560]  talk to ad and some of the other callers wild matthew jason dwight and others that are holding

[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:33.400]  vinyl constitutional lawyer vinyl media media analyst we're going to talk to ad and others
[02:00:33.400 --> 02:00:39.080]  coming up the next segment then we'll shift gears after we take calls and get back into this whole
[02:00:39.080 --> 02:00:45.000]  confederate flag situation which is the biggest waving a red flag in front of a bull i've ever
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:50.360]  seen i mean this is just classic to now the memphis mayor wants to literally dig up confederate
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:58.200]  general and move him this is just getting where you're just obsessed and offended by everything
[02:00:59.160 --> 02:01:03.960]  and people don't even know historically what the context is this is the rise of the total idiots
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:11.160]  like mark dice talked to 10 people and seven of them signed a petition to ban the american flag
[02:01:11.160 --> 02:01:21.160]  and change it to an all-seeing eye pyramid this is the triumph of mind control where people are
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:27.880]  illiterate about everything reading writing arithmetic history social skills talking but they
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:35.480]  know how to get obsessed and what to be offended by and it's all phantoms while they're being conquered
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:42.600]  vinyl tpp is this not one of the most naked examples of a secret body that we're not allowed to see
[02:01:43.320 --> 02:01:49.720]  part of it leaks totally draconian bipartisan they pass it and now obama is going to be coming
[02:01:49.720 --> 02:01:53.880]  back with this fast-tracked initiative uh to a foreign body and we don't even know
[02:01:53.880 --> 02:02:01.080]  everything that's going on in it i mean this this is really incredible you know alex at the word
[02:02:01.080 --> 02:02:07.640]  fast track i think is often misunderstood by people as meaning effective and efficient and quick
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:12.520]  you know when 29 million dollars or so was fast track to individuals in charleston
[02:02:13.160 --> 02:02:20.280]  no big there's a great no no fast track is a euphemism it means in essence a non-review
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:27.640]  something that is not subject to review or or um inspection now what people don't understand
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:34.760]  and you said this initially was the word globalism sounds good it sounds terrific it sounds like oh
[02:02:34.760 --> 02:02:39.080]  that's whatever we are the world remember that i like to teach the world to sing kumbaya let's hold
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:43.160]  hands what we're talking about is a reconfiguration of the world i don't have to tell you this into
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:49.720]  this unipolar world this is beyond let me be frank with you and i'm sorry i'm going to say this
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:57.160]  the american people by and large are great people but stupid illiterate not very bright
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:03.960]  not very educated great on sports great on issues that don't matter great on pop culture great on
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:10.360]  live stuff but when it comes to being able to understand what it is that is critical to their
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:17.160]  survival absolutely not a clue i'm sorry to say this i'm sorry to break the news to you
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:23.800]  but we are absolutely mind bogglingly demented when it comes to being able to recognize this
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:31.640]  i don't understand why people don't under don't get the fact that what we're seeing is a reconfiguration
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:38.280]  a reconciliation a a reestablishment of the world you know alex you've said new world order to the
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:43.240]  point why do people don't really understand it i think they have habituated to it i think they
[02:03:43.240 --> 02:03:49.400]  have been conditioned to this term as some kind of weird conspiratorial phrase or shibboleth that
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:54.600]  you use that is somehow doesn't mean anything we're talking about taking everything that we know
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:04:03.720]  our jurisdiction our country and turning it into basically a member state of a world organization
[02:04:03.720 --> 02:04:08.520]  where the president of the united states isn't the leader of the free world but basically we're
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:15.560]  the enforcer we're the lucah bros we back up either nato or central banks and the like and this
[02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:21.480]  right off the bat what i've just said and you understand it listeners understand it but for
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:27.720]  most american people i'm sorry they will scratch their head and say i don't know what the hell
[02:04:27.720 --> 02:04:35.240]  you're talking about but i do know my flags and i do know katlyn jenner and i know sport i'm sorry
[02:04:35.240 --> 02:04:42.520]  alex but that's who we are the united states of the illiterate that is the best three minutes i've
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:50.200]  heard hands down describing the tpp it is a total takeover puts all of our laws and rights into a
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:58.360]  shadowy secret offshore corporate fascist combine so they can do to us what they've done to grace
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:06.440]  well said linel a mother in westbrook main was arrested by police and charged with child endangerment
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:12.520]  after she let her seven-year-old daughter play unsupervised in a park only a few hundred feet
[02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:18.280]  from their home nicole jensen said that police asked her to accompany them to the station because
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:24.760]  her child was outside unsupervised and wouldn't you know it it was a nosy neighbor who called the
[02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:30.920]  cops after seeing the child alone in the park it has now become the norm for americans to panic
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:36.680]  and call the police if they see a child playing in a park even though jensen can see the park from
[02:05:36.680 --> 02:05:42.680]  her porch and requires that her kids check in with her every hour well it wasn't enough instead of
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:48.600]  walking the girl one minute to her home the cops took the child into custody the case has been deferred
[02:05:48.600 --> 02:05:55.240]  to the dhhs and jensen says she will go to court to fight against the charges of endangerment

[02:08:15.000 --> 02:08:26.120]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war other arrested charged with child
[02:08:26.120 --> 02:08:31.400]  endangerment for letting a seven-year-old plant a park across the street from her house while she
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:40.280]  watched her playground was 200 feet away from her home with an eyesight we all under about the age
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:52.920]  50 or so or i'd say everybody above the age of 30 grew up being able to go outside and play
[02:08:54.120 --> 02:08:58.680]  or grew up even in the city people send seven eight nine-year-olds out to go get a mccartney
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:04.920]  milk at the corner store kids had to be able to learn how to follow orders how to not walk on the
[02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:13.880]  street how to cross the street when the light turned green how to look both ways
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:24.440]  and so if you're above about the age 30 you grew up in a world where you had the basic
[02:09:24.440 --> 02:09:32.360]  freedom of movement but this latest article is nothing compared to the one two weeks ago
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:39.080]  where the 11-year-old his parents didn't get home till six he got home at 4 4 30 was playing basketball
[02:09:40.600 --> 02:09:42.840]  in the cyclone fenced backyard
[02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:49.880]  and they saw him playing alone in a neighbor called and the police came and they charged
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:53.480]  the parents with endangerment she took it to court and barely beat it
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:10:00.520]  but since when did it become the law that you couldn't play outside well there is no law
[02:10:00.520 --> 02:10:06.440]  law they can say that we interpret this as endangerment well a jury is going to find if you
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:10.920]  give a bucket of hydrofluorosilic acid
[02:10:13.240 --> 02:10:18.600]  or some other deadly acid to a seven-year-old and tell them go out and play on the street with it
[02:10:19.320 --> 02:10:24.280]  that it's beyond child endangerment it's attempted murder because you could reasonably
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:35.320]  think they're going to get killed or blinded with this but it is the established activity of humans
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:39.720]  for children to play outside but see it's the triumph of ignorance there is the perception
[02:10:39.720 --> 02:10:46.040]  that gun crimes up even though it's down between 50 and 60 percent since 1992 just department's
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:52.520]  own numbers that's not even debated there is the perception there are more shark attacks even though
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:10:59.320]  they're actually down there is the perception that there's all this rampant racism all of this
[02:10:59.320 --> 02:11:04.200]  is the triumph of hype and i want to get into the economy and take your phone calls but during
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:09.480]  the break i was reading this article again where the police and the prosecutors where the straight
[02:11:09.480 --> 02:11:17.640]  face go yes this was very dangerous and i even looked up the area it's a nice area but so what
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:21.320]  if you're seven-year-olds playing in the park cross street and you're watching them let them
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:26.760]  that's a parent's decision that's why texas is a baptist state super conservative but
[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:33.960]  you can give your five-year-old drinking your beer you can buy them a beer it's up to the
[02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:39.480]  establishment owners again business owners rights to refuse to sell you that wine or beer for your
[02:11:39.480 --> 02:11:45.720]  small child in europe they give their kids water down beer and wine the point is is that it's still
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:52.360]  the law in texas you can go in and order your child to beer in a super conservative state because
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:57.800]  they understood you take parental rights away you lose everything it's up to a parent's decision
[02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:06.600]  now if you've got your child playing with what you know is a dysfunctional firearm they don't
[02:12:06.600 --> 02:12:10.600]  have firearms training and they're in their backyard whether that is child endangerment
[02:12:10.600 --> 02:12:17.720]  but is it child endangerment they're now trying to pass laws to say giving anyone under the age of
[02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:24.040]  10 a BB gun the problem is the children are out of control they've never been in the real world
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:28.840]  they don't know how to tie their shoelaces figuratively they play video games all day
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:33.240]  the studies show they're becoming brain damaged from it they don't even have language anymore
[02:12:33.240 --> 02:12:41.400]  my dad's dad knew how to fix anything and knew how to do accounting and play golf and
[02:12:41.400 --> 02:12:47.000]  square dance at the same time the point is he was a man he could do it all my dad though was
[02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:51.640]  a specialist he went to college became a chemist and a doctor he still knows probably it was not
[02:12:51.640 --> 02:12:59.000]  exaggerate 10 times more than i do about fixing things not as much as his dad then there's me i
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:05.320]  don't know that much but compared to most men they're 41 i know a lot most men i know now can't
[02:13:05.320 --> 02:13:11.880]  change a tire under the age of 40 and they're making the cars now where have you put a battery in
[02:13:12.440 --> 02:13:16.680]  say in a Volkswagen it sends you a message and turns the battery off because you didn't go to
[02:13:16.680 --> 02:13:21.560]  their dealership and pay extra for one that's the smart cars where everything's wired they're
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:26.920]  building a world where we're basket cases and our guests beautifully said that earlier Lionel
[02:13:26.920 --> 02:13:31.080]  when he talked about we're obsessed with everything that doesn't matter everything
[02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:36.040]  that can't feed us everything that can't teach us how to be competent rebel flags and Caitlyn Jenner
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:41.960]  but we don't know all the basics this is the plan and now we're watching the exact playbook
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:46.600]  the imf and world bank fronts for private banks imf and world banks just the federal reserves
[02:13:46.600 --> 02:13:53.080]  named worldwide same european banks own it they are now imploding Greece with the same program
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:58.280]  convincing the world that most of it is Greek debt when 92 percent of it is not just like Iceland
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:03.880]  Iceland though arrested their head bankers went into all the documents and said in their case
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:09.000]  93 percent of this is not our debt we'll pay the seven percent that's national debt the 93 of
[02:14:09.000 --> 02:14:14.600]  the derivatives we're not doing it england put them on a terror watch list every Icelander 400
[02:14:14.600 --> 02:14:19.880]  thousand of them they had to back off when it came out it was british banks involved so they're
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:24.840]  going to try to do this imagine when they have a cashless society that's my rant we're going to
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:32.040]  get Lionel's rant then we're going to ad wild to white and others go ahead Lionel likes i've got
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:35.880]  to tell you this in fact i've wanted to say this for a long time when i was a prosecutor the area
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:41.800]  that i found the most problematic was doing dependencies in the juvenile system and specifically
[02:14:41.800 --> 02:14:47.240]  i used to deal with termination of parental rights tpr what happened was the state of florida
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:52.760]  at the time would come in and say that if you could show that a child was either abused abandoned
[02:14:52.760 --> 02:14:58.280]  or neglected depending upon the standard which nobody could really tell me you'd go before a
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:06.120]  judge and a judge would remove a child disentangle disengorge like can join twins a child with its
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:12.360]  parents and what nature gave you a court would separate them what was interesting was that they
[02:15:12.360 --> 02:15:16.280]  would take these poor people who might not have been they were poor they might not have been the
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:21.960]  smartest they might not have been educated they had a hard time with schedules but they were the
[02:15:21.960 --> 02:15:28.280]  parents and they would have a mother let's say go to parenting classes or learn about something
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:34.200]  somebody would pick up a phone drop a dime on a neighbor and my favorite was failure to thrive
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:39.720]  you know the jones kid he has a son who doesn't look like he's growing as much as the others
[02:15:39.720 --> 02:15:47.400]  something's wrong something strange and then they would call an overworked underpaid 20 year old
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:53.880]  caseworker who knew nothing about raising kids who was so afraid of perhaps signing off and being
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:16:01.720]  the negligent caseworker who let little alex go to his death that they would leap on this family
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:07.400]  overreact and then you are doomed and then they would take this poor parent and they say you know
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:13.160]  what mrs. jones because you didn't go to your parenting classes because you didn't follow this
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:19.880]  set of instructions which we think you need to know as a parent and now little alex has been
[02:16:19.880 --> 02:16:27.000]  placed in foster care with this rich family with a lot of cool toys and a lot of neat stuff for such
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:34.520]  a long period of time that we think it will be unfair to return alex from this very nice family
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:41.640]  who might want to adopt him back to you in your trailer and your squalor and this hovel and i
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:49.640]  alex murder cases didn't bother me i shouldn't say that they bothered me but nothing caused me to lose
[02:16:50.200 --> 02:16:58.840]  sleep to realize that i was a part of a system that could take a child think about this forget
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:04.600]  divorce divorce is horrible enough but you are still the parent and you might not be married but it's
[02:17:04.600 --> 02:17:12.360]  two people who kind of sort of agree but just imagine the power of the state of texas or florida
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:20.520]  saying that your child by virtue of edict by virtue of judicial fiat is not yours anymore
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:27.000]  cannot take under your will you have no authority goodbye and imagine this happens
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:33.800]  every single day and nobody can tell you alex if you called up a police officer who said listen
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:41.480]  i want to show my son how to use weapons can you tell me what to do no you give me guideline
[02:17:41.480 --> 02:17:46.680]  no i want to spank my child but i want to do it the right way can you tell me what isn't isn't
[02:17:46.680 --> 02:17:53.880]  acceptable no i want to put my child on a vegan diet or a macro biotic diet or i'm against
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:18:01.080]  circumcision or i'm against this medication or i'm whatever can you tell me what is okay no they
[02:18:01.080 --> 02:18:06.840]  won't it's all nebulous so they can do whatever they want and it all began with saying parents
[02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:11.000]  needed the state to come in and then once you've destroyed the role of parents they can take
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:16.040]  everybody's kids or you're just basically a babysitter you follow what the government system
[02:18:16.040 --> 02:18:21.160]  says for your children or they'll be taken and the next shoot a drop is inoculate or we're going
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:28.440]  to take your children it's already begun outside of law by projecting neglect onto it as melissa
[02:18:28.440 --> 02:18:34.600]  harris perry and msnbc have wanted we haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children
[02:18:34.600 --> 02:18:39.240]  so part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:43.400]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities once it's
[02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:48.280]  everybody's responsibility and not just the households then we start making better investments
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:52.760]  and that's central right there because to decode this when you get involved with the because
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:56.520]  i've covered this as well and i got to where i couldn't cover it back when i was a local reporter
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:01.000]  because these were good families they were taking kids from these are people hadn't done anything
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:05.720]  and i knew it was because it was a good kid that was two years old or a year old and they could get
[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:10.520]  a half million dollars in the racket for rich parents that didn't know what was going on you
[02:19:10.520 --> 02:19:15.240]  know to get it you know some trophy wife who can't have kids and some guys that's worth 50 million
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:20.200]  dollars that's who they were really targeting was the good families in many cases to get those premium
[02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:27.640]  quote children and to see it it was so so incredibly sick and then all the social workers and lawyers
[02:19:27.640 --> 02:19:33.240]  and cops were doing was trying to cover their butts to go along with the system it is unbelievable
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:37.560]  and alex you know one of the things that you gotta realize or people have to realize
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:41.800]  is that you have people who are untrained i gotta tell you this one story stay there i had to come

[02:24:15.480 --> 02:24:16.600]  seems like yesterday
[02:24:16.600 --> 02:24:32.040]  oh there's no inflation under the globalist system my mother never calls me during the show
[02:24:32.040 --> 02:24:36.840]  i mean maybe once every two years she sent me a text message she's listening and she says
[02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:43.480]  i've been listening for over an hour no discussion of Puerto Rico saying they're
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:50.200]  going to default on their sovereign bonds we did cover it the first hour mother
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:54.680]  but yes and she finished the text message with this is a big deal
[02:24:54.680 --> 02:24:58.600]  we are going to go to the calls we are going to get into this you know there's a problem there
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:25:04.360]  Lionel i've been so close to this so long that as it all starts to happen i'm not making the big
[02:25:04.360 --> 02:25:08.840]  deal out of it i should be i mean i'm accused of being an alarmist i'm kind of like an alarmist
[02:25:08.840 --> 02:25:15.800]  before it happens you know once it all happens then i'm kind of just well here it is uh but it's
[02:25:15.800 --> 02:25:21.720]  very disgusting i want to get that moment but finishing up with what's changed is the feds
[02:25:21.720 --> 02:25:26.680]  and the guidelines and the college teaching says it's abuse and neglect if kids are playing the
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:31.320]  park across the street and you've got cattle tell neighbors that start the chain reaction
[02:25:31.320 --> 02:25:35.720]  where the police are worried about liability if they don't respond and the kid gets hurt
[02:25:35.720 --> 02:25:39.880]  what's changed is we're a nation of bizarre cowards that are afraid to even come out of our
[02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:45.640]  houses we've been domesticated how do we reverse that line let me tell you well you we we need a
[02:25:45.640 --> 02:25:49.240]  revolution let me tell you something alex if somebody picks up the phone and drops a dime
[02:25:49.240 --> 02:25:55.640]  on you and your wife and you all of a sudden the jones family is on the hit parade uh you you can't
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:26:01.240]  get your name off it it's not like when you're arrested you can steal it it's there and it's
[02:26:01.240 --> 02:26:06.360]  an administrative record you say excuse me this was unfounded this particular case i need
[02:26:06.360 --> 02:26:11.320]  licensure in the in the coming future i'm having insurance problems i want to be a let's say a
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:17.400]  foster parent myself can you remove this report even though it was unfounded i'm sorry you can't
[02:26:17.400 --> 02:26:24.600]  by the way alex um i mean if i could at linomedia my twitter feed which i blurt out memes all day
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:29.320]  long i talked about this this one time which really got people's attention this is a true story
[02:26:29.320 --> 02:26:33.480]  little girl was at a school she falls down she goes to the nurse the nurse looks her just to
[02:26:33.480 --> 02:26:41.320]  make sure she's okay they take off her her shirt and they see bruises oh bruises so immediately
[02:26:41.320 --> 02:26:47.960]  the teacher freaking out saying i don't want to be responsible for now reporting it she calls cps
[02:26:47.960 --> 02:26:56.600]  cps sends over a 20 something who's again overworked underpaid and alex so help me god this 20
[02:26:56.600 --> 02:27:02.120]  something turns into this kid and says does your daddy ever touch you down there it was a single parent
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:08.200]  where that came from i have no idea did your dad does your daddy touch you there he said yes
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:16.840]  that was it when she said after my bath he said aha ritualized you know what it turned out to be
[02:27:16.840 --> 02:27:23.400]  and thousands of dollars and embarrassment later he had to apply an ointment for someone to the doctor
[02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:29.080]  for some type of vaginitis or something and it said after a bath now when you are put in the
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:34.440]  position alex and imagine all the enemies that you have and people that you don't like but when you
[02:27:35.080 --> 02:27:42.680]  are even into that as far as being a part of child abuse or child sexual misadventure the
[02:27:42.680 --> 02:27:50.040]  stigma sticks forever and you can't and it's all because of the knitting it's it's like the famous
[02:27:50.040 --> 02:27:54.920]  cases of walmart and others where it showed the mom and the dad with their two girls they each had a
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:28:00.120]  towel over them and they were hugging them and they had towels on them and they were calling it
[02:28:00.120 --> 02:28:05.320]  pedophilia when real pedophilia is going on nobody's getting in trouble half the time and then
[02:28:05.320 --> 02:28:11.000]  meanwhile the photo came out on the news like on abc news and it was nothing but walmart wanted to
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:15.800]  protect itself or eckards i mean it's happened with all of them right and and and so they call
[02:28:15.800 --> 02:28:20.280]  in the police who then act like it's real and legitimate we've got to go to break it and i
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:24.600]  promise or they can punch me in the nose i'm going to ad mathy wild jason dwight on the
[02:28:24.600 --> 02:28:27.960]  economy and i should have done this the whole show i know you would want to talk about that as
[02:28:27.960 --> 02:28:34.360]  well as we go out to break let's start talking about this now how big a deal is it because we
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:38.280]  know the economy is untenable we know the debts are untenable but we've been signed on to the
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:43.640]  derivatives is the main reason we're untenable they raised taxes so much in greece that less
[02:28:43.640 --> 02:28:47.880]  money came in now they want more taxes raised and people say i am f you're not stupid why are you
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:53.800]  doing this because they want them to become fully bankrupt and fully conquered but what do you make
[02:28:53.800 --> 02:28:58.440]  a port of rica new york times port of rica's governor says you'll need to pull the island
[02:28:58.440 --> 02:29:03.560]  out of a death spiral is included that the commonwealth cannot pay its 72 billion in debts
[02:29:03.560 --> 02:29:08.120]  an administration will probably have wide-ranging financial repercussions i mean this this the
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:13.240]  51st state right there bro alex let me put it you this way let me ask you this question if you
[02:29:13.240 --> 02:29:17.960]  wanted to be the most powerful person on the planet and you wanted to destroy a country how would you
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:23.800]  do it i do with an economic takeover buying off the ministers exactly i would not fire a weapon i
[02:29:23.800 --> 02:29:28.920]  would not send in a troop i either explain this when we come back the secret to reeling the world

[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:41.080]  i'm glad my mom texted me because uh you know she was every two years she might call one time charlie
[02:29:41.080 --> 02:29:46.040]  sheen was on melton down that famous deal she called up she said stop this right now this is not
[02:29:46.040 --> 02:29:51.000]  what your show is about shut it off now of course i didn't should listen to her on the march the
[02:29:51.000 --> 02:30:02.760]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network police departments across the country
[02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:09.640]  are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays which use cell phone towers to
[02:30:09.640 --> 02:30:17.080]  intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants the technology comes courtesy of the
[02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:23.640]  fbi who have forced our nation's police departments into signing nondisclosure agreements forbidding
[02:30:23.640 --> 02:30:29.720]  them from publicly talking about the technology needless to say this is a direct violation of
[02:30:29.720 --> 02:30:34.840]  our fourth amendment and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying
[02:30:34.840 --> 02:30:40.440]  where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people
[02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:46.440]  who are not even suspected of any crimes once again more evidence that the police state isn't

[02:33:34.600 --> 02:33:43.960]  bubbles i wish that i'd been wrong about all this but it wasn't hard to be right histories pretty
[02:33:43.960 --> 02:33:53.080]  simple they say it doesn't repeat that it rhymes and that certainly is a very apropos way of putting
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:34:00.280]  it lionel former defense lawyer and prosecutor tv critic radio host on the top 100 talkers in the
[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:05.080]  country corner talkers magazine uh he joins us i met him years ago and i was in the keynote address
[02:34:05.080 --> 02:34:09.800]  at a talkers in new york where he was the master of ceremonies and i don't even agree with you know
[02:34:09.800 --> 02:34:14.680]  maybe 10 what he has to say but i i get his perspective on the 10 i don't agree with and on
[02:34:14.680 --> 02:34:19.480]  the other 90 he has a great way of putting things a lot of good stories and antidotes
[02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:24.120]  it's without further ado i want to go to ad and others that have been patiently holding but i wanted
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:30.360]  to give you a chance because you got cut off by the break some people spend this over the years
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:34.760]  and say you say the debt's too big and then it's untenable because you want the confidence to be
[02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:40.920]  lost and if people listen to you we're going to go under and i'm like uh no uh if we have you know
[02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:46.600]  two quadrillion plus derivatives that aren't our debt that these big six megabanks created and
[02:34:46.600 --> 02:34:52.120]  have signed us on to and they keep raising taxes when they know at a certain point it hurts tax
[02:34:52.120 --> 02:34:57.160]  receipts and we know the philosophy is to consolidate control you were getting to that point
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:02.760]  so restart with how do you conquer a country this is what they admit they're doing everybody from
[02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:09.640]  henry kissinger to brzeznik brzezinski to just all of them wrote books bragging how they're
[02:35:09.640 --> 02:35:13.400]  conquering the world there's a reason when brzeznik brzezinski or henry kissinger or
[02:35:13.400 --> 02:35:18.840]  david rockefeller shows up and the saudi princes are bowing to them not the other way around then
[02:35:18.840 --> 02:35:26.200]  obama bows to them i mean these guys really did set up our modern world and it's not pretty
[02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:31.160]  and now they're getting ready to take down because they've already taken over the world they don't
[02:35:31.160 --> 02:35:37.480]  need the west anymore to take over the world under other guys's democratizing humanitarian
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:43.080]  whatever now they're in their in game radicalism to take over the middle east in africa financial
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:47.560]  implosion europe they've already taken over latin america i mean i know the history of latin america
[02:35:47.560 --> 02:35:53.240]  i just stalled done it and how even though they had a history of sugar cane slaves and others that
[02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:58.680]  came there and natives that didn't know how to fight back against it and colonialism after they
[02:35:58.680 --> 02:36:03.560]  got out from under colonialism for a while in five or six spots they were booming they were
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:09.800]  free market they were as rich as we were they were inventing stuff it'd be so cool if i could
[02:36:09.800 --> 02:36:15.320]  moved off chile or argentina when i was old it's a beautiful down there it'd be so cool to have other
[02:36:15.320 --> 02:36:20.680]  free countries i look around there's nowhere for me to run i mean i'll be honest if there was some
[02:36:20.680 --> 02:36:26.200]  really cool free place i'd get out of here i mean i love america but man i'm telling you the people
[02:36:26.200 --> 02:36:30.920]  are so dumb down on average the awake people are the salt of the earth we've been an exceptional
[02:36:30.920 --> 02:36:37.400]  country no one i mean i was at my cousin's uh wedding reception at the kalamazoo air museum
[02:36:37.400 --> 02:36:43.320]  the pictures do not do it justice and the reception at night with a great dj in dancing
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:48.920]  was underneath the sr 71 blackbird they had prototypes in the 50s it officially started
[02:36:48.920 --> 02:36:54.520]  flying in 63 like the b2 bomber officially started flying in 87 it was flying around the 70s
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:01.880]  really flies like mock five mock six they you know the russians had jets that would go mock
[02:37:01.880 --> 02:37:05.720]  three and missiles that would go mock 4.5 and they couldn't shoot it down it's because it goes
[02:37:05.720 --> 02:37:11.080]  faster than mock three boys and they tell us this is still the fastest plane in the world
[02:37:11.960 --> 02:37:18.440]  and my table was right under its nose and i looked at how science fiction s get looked
[02:37:18.440 --> 02:37:26.600]  with the cockpits forward and back it's just amazing our our technology i mean the countries
[02:37:26.600 --> 02:37:32.840]  can't build this today okay and different groups of different flares you know we can't build rockets
[02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:36.600]  like the russians they can't build stealth aircraft but i mean i look at america what we become
[02:37:37.720 --> 02:37:43.000]  it's a joke and we have to admit we're a joke it's like if i woke up in a ditch with vomit all over
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:47.960]  me i've hit rock bottom i haven't actually done that but you get my point if i wake up don't know
[02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:55.080]  where i've been for three days like the hangover might be a good time to stop and i just we're a
[02:37:55.080 --> 02:38:03.480]  joke people watching people savor oh let's dig up confederate generals yes yes i mean it's mental
[02:38:03.480 --> 02:38:08.920]  illness all right i'm ranting get in your point of the economy that i'm going to the calls well
[02:38:08.920 --> 02:38:13.720]  i'll let you know it's funny did you say this i look out my window and i can look and i see the
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:19.240]  intrepid right there on the Hudson river and there's an sr 771 or 71 right there and i see this
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:25.240]  thing every single day and i'm thinking to myself this was a time where we had enemies that were
[02:38:25.240 --> 02:38:30.360]  tenable and palpable and real they weren't theoretical they were actual enemies it was
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:35.080]  the last time that the government that our country really stood for something where we were fighting
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:40.680]  actual real enemies and you can argue about how we got into pearl harbor but you know alex
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:45.400]  you mentioned something before which is interesting about history and that it doesn't repeat itself
[02:38:45.400 --> 02:38:51.560]  but it rhymes tollstoy said the greatest piece ever on the subject and that is that history would be
[02:38:51.560 --> 02:38:59.240]  a wonderful thing if only it were true and what we believe to be history does not exist now if i
[02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:05.400]  were going to destroy this country here's what i would do first and foremost i would distract with
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:12.760]  bread and circuses the people more than ever number two i would have as a foundation for much of the
[02:39:12.760 --> 02:39:20.280]  economy this tissue thin veneer this latticework of cotton candy of air called the derivative
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:27.560]  you say one and a half maybe two could be four or five quadrillion dollars of nothing then i would
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:35.160]  throw in the myth alex of american exceptionalism i would always have the flag and lee greenwood
[02:39:35.160 --> 02:39:42.040]  and john wane and ronald reagan and fox news and we're the great we are impenetrable we are never
[02:39:42.040 --> 02:39:48.840]  going to be port urico or greece or island or portugal or the e you we're the united states we
[02:39:48.840 --> 02:39:56.600]  are immunized we have a vaccine against this that's what will doom us the idea because alex this is a
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:40:02.680]  beta test there everything happens in europe and those parts of the world first and then we catch
[02:40:02.680 --> 02:40:08.440]  they sneeze we catch oh you're right the i m f and world bank admits that okay we've taken on africa
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:14.440]  and latin america now we're going to move on to western countries and they're doing it and the only
[02:40:14.440 --> 02:40:19.480]  country you say no was island and they went in they arrested the people and found out guess what it
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:24.600]  wasn't even they're dead and i'm going to also go in alex and i'm going to fool people for example
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:29.640]  i'm going to tell people that there are new currencies of war a new casus belleye i'm not
[02:40:29.640 --> 02:40:34.360]  going to let them know about water i'm not going to ever let them know that we went into libya
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:39.160]  over water try newbie and sandstone aquifer i'm never going to do that i'm never going to
[02:40:39.160 --> 02:40:46.280]  ever let people understand the what and who runs the world are a very small group of central banks
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:53.560]  and very very uh at the top of the pyramid these elite banksters and all there is is mega banks
[02:40:53.560 --> 02:40:59.000]  big energy and weapons and all we're going to do is we're going to create fictions and bad guys
[02:40:59.000 --> 02:41:05.560]  do isis and then we're going to confuse people we're going to cause the american people to be
[02:41:05.560 --> 02:41:11.080]  always upset over something and fool them and dupe them into thinking that they're involved
[02:41:11.080 --> 02:41:16.840]  we're going to let them think that there's some confederate war flag or battle flag controversy
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:21.800]  we're going to also throw it we're going to have a country that knows more about the physics of
[02:41:21.800 --> 02:41:27.880]  footballs and deflate gate than they do the rudiments and a b sidarian aspects of our economy
[02:41:27.880 --> 02:41:36.200]  we're going to have people who are so brain dead and narcotized voluntarily and through this alex
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:41.720]  through this individual hypnotic sense of selfishness we're going to turn everything
[02:41:41.720 --> 02:41:48.520]  that's right a selfie we're then going to turn and remove them from individual interaction
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:54.440]  and caring and being global and being connected because alex one day people are going to say
[02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:59.880]  when you ask them where are you where do you live you're not going to say i'm a proud texan
[02:41:59.880 --> 02:42:06.680]  they're going to say i live here this is where i my smartphone my smartphone and because of this
[02:42:06.680 --> 02:42:15.560]  systemic continued habituation this organic dulling down i'm going to then as everybody is
[02:42:15.560 --> 02:42:22.440]  being distracted by the three card monty of the economic downturn while we're looking this way
[02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:28.200]  i'm going to little by little take everything from this country and then one day before you
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:34.360]  know what it's going to be it'll start maybe with a rumbling it'll start and we'll start to see the
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:41.720]  initial threads the initial tremors of a financial collapse and the very people who run the world are
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:49.960]  so thrilled because they crave and they thrive on disorder and disaster that's why when there's
[02:42:49.960 --> 02:42:55.720]  racial disharmony when there's crime when there's people in the streets when we turn to the government
[02:42:55.720 --> 02:43:03.480]  in the hegelian dialectic this classic wonderful progression and we say more control more more
[02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:13.400]  power more authority then one day it's over and your tombstone your words your final valedictory
[02:43:13.400 --> 02:43:21.560]  alec sad to say will be i told you so you thought i was just somebody who was conspiracy theorist
[02:43:21.560 --> 02:43:27.880]  it's going to be too late you thought i was doing this just for some kind of an act you didn't
[02:43:27.880 --> 02:43:34.440]  realize that what i was saying and what the world was saying was there the whole time and you
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:40.520]  didn't listen to me and i told you and i tried to make it as simple as possible and i brought in
[02:43:40.520 --> 02:43:46.920]  guests to try to explain it in different ways but max keiser a salinity of paul k robert uh
[02:43:46.920 --> 02:43:54.040]  paul watson and you've tried so hard and you know alex the thing that is the most important
[02:43:54.040 --> 02:44:01.160]  is that i don't know which vector i'm being hit with every single day you wake up and you feel
[02:44:01.160 --> 02:44:05.960]  okay and then you start to look at the news and you say my god where where do i start today and
[02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:09.480]  that's what they want they want to overwhelm us but at the same time we've just got to
[02:44:09.480 --> 02:44:14.440]  realize it is the animating contest since studies show that old plants won't grow they're not some
[02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:21.640]  wind some rain something pushing them the reason we're so weak is we've been hiding from responsibilities
[02:44:21.640 --> 02:44:25.160]  well that's why you know if you live a sedentary lifestyle you die when you're 40 not when you're
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:30.520]  90 we need to go out and fight this corruption and become aware of it and that will turn the tide
[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:34.360]  but hey this is the best interview ever with you linel i want to go to calls but the way you
[02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:39.800]  crystallized well you know the tpp in three minutes the way in the last six seven eight minutes
[02:44:39.800 --> 02:44:45.480]  you crystallized if i was the enemy of free humanity or if i wanted to destroy a free country
[02:44:45.480 --> 02:44:50.120]  this is how i would do it uh or the plan to destroy a free people you have done it you've
[02:44:50.120 --> 02:44:55.880]  really laid it out you can see how they've put us in a virtual reality of mainstream media and
[02:44:55.880 --> 02:45:02.200]  and selfies and iphone's while they're stealing the real world around us and it's not to conquer it
[02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:08.440]  so they can manage it better they've decided to get rid of humanity all right ad you're a real trooper
[02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:11.720]  and then Dwight and all the rest of these troopers thank you for holding i really want to hear what
[02:45:11.720 --> 02:45:18.520]  you have to say on the economy on Puerto Rico getting ready to go bankrupt uh on uh grease
[02:45:18.520 --> 02:45:23.800]  getting ready to go bankrupt maneuvered into it by design uh the media all calling them lazy they
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:29.320]  deserve it uh no no no yeah you know obama saying uh just because you raise the debt limit doesn't
[02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:35.080]  mean you've raised the debt this is again upside down opposite world uh you didn't build your business
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:42.520]  but the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus are real ad in Delaware you're on the air thank you well i've
[02:45:42.520 --> 02:45:48.040]  got to tell you alex after 10 years of you teaching me everything i needed to know uh
[02:45:48.040 --> 02:45:55.640]  on analysts analyzing these idiots um you know i've i've formed an amalgam of algorithm analytics
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:46:02.600]  which really does uh point out their agenda atrocity and the bait and switch brain flooding
[02:46:02.600 --> 02:46:07.880]  that they like to run on the american people in operation mockingbird which is really what your
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:14.680]  television is called um we're seeing the guys from operation paperclip popping up like whack-a-mole
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:19.480]  that scares me with Kissinger and brzezinski running around hanging out with bush wearing
[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:25.560]  tuxedos and they're on their fifth or sixth heart transplant it all spells the annihilation of the
[02:46:25.560 --> 02:46:33.240]  united states the trans specific partnership or the toilet paper policy which means we will have none
[02:46:33.240 --> 02:46:40.920]  basically is the spike in the last barrel of sustenance that this country has held out on
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:47.560]  while they lit the fuse we are the dynamite and the fuse is burnt through europe it's burnt through
[02:46:47.560 --> 02:46:54.920]  the ukraine and thereafter i really believe alex we're leading up to a bait and switch in other
[02:46:54.920 --> 02:47:02.120]  words uh he is the manchurian candidate obama is a fake in a hologram uh he's destroyed everything
[02:47:02.840 --> 02:47:09.720]  i'm hearing talk of russia being set up to attack america as they run to their bunkers
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:18.360]  and they will use a bio weapon this time and i kind of believe it alex all right i'm gonna
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:22.280]  have you comment again as you've been holding so long but going back to line all i know is i've
[02:47:22.280 --> 02:47:27.320]  always had a sense of urgency because i knew we needed to start reversing militarization of police
[02:47:27.320 --> 02:47:33.320]  all of it because it was part of a larger plan now the establishment it's in the guardian it's all
[02:47:33.320 --> 02:47:38.360]  of the news our building bunkers our building secret airstrips they are bugging out of major cities
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.120]  maybe it's not this year next year i hope it never happens let's be clear i'm not nero all
[02:47:44.120 --> 02:47:50.200]  wrong berms but there does seem to be an urgency in the establishment itself more and more indicators
[02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:54.680]  we know we're sitting on a house of cards what does your gut tell you and what other folks in
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:59.160]  new york tell you you know it's funny you say that remember alex when there was a tsunami
[02:47:59.160 --> 02:48:06.280]  and people suggested that uh there was not one elephant that was found dead the theory is that
[02:48:06.280 --> 02:48:13.240]  if you notice elephants starting to move inland and animals and you see those people who are
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:21.080]  responding on frequencies that we don't pay attention to that when the elite when the uber
[02:48:21.080 --> 02:48:27.400]  rich by the way i love these people that i know who think they're rich they may have a million or
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:34.760]  two they're not even in we're not talking about necessarily monetary rich but when these people
[02:48:34.760 --> 02:48:43.000]  are sounding the alarm when they're quietly disintegrating or disengaging themselves from
[02:48:43.000 --> 02:48:49.080]  that which is american and they're moving like who is it uh the fellow who's uh from um oh god the
[02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:54.360]  famous cameron was going to new zealand and others what does that tell you what does that mean when
[02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:59.400]  you're finding dual citizenship and the like look the bottom line is that we have never seen
[02:49:00.280 --> 02:49:07.080]  anything like this in the history of the world where we are going more and more towards a unipolar
[02:49:07.080 --> 02:49:14.040]  world putin talked about this look at how we are going to putin and others and sticking a thumb in
[02:49:14.040 --> 02:49:20.760]  his eye and basically saying come on bring it on there are people alex who want there to be
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:28.280]  a world on fire when there was calamity when there was mayhem when there was entropy when
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:34.520]  there was disaster then they can buy things on a fire sale this is when they're the happiest
[02:49:34.520 --> 02:49:41.240]  this is remember if greece fails who wasn't forums who said this how would you like to buy the parthenon
[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:49.160]  on a song when a country collapses and they turn to say help us out who are the people helping
[02:49:49.160 --> 02:49:56.120]  you out alex if you and i were the kings of the world we would be high fiving each other we would
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:01.880]  go and we would say to these countries we'll help you out but it will be for a cost and then little
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:09.720]  by little our different unions our different groups we consolidate and all of a sudden what's missing
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:18.520]  jurisdiction monetary systems nationality and all of the hints were there from spp to tpp to
[02:50:18.520 --> 02:50:24.520]  sopa to syspa from every vector and angle you can imagine from intellectual property to actual
[02:50:24.520 --> 02:50:33.320]  trade agreements and we must master and the elites have mastered the art of the euphemism
[02:50:33.320 --> 02:50:42.600]  it's a trade agreement it's a world it's a fast track it's a smart phone speed fast track efficient
[02:50:42.600 --> 02:50:50.680]  smart beyond the grid patriot act affordable care left behind i mean you can't the better the
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:56.680]  word there's an inverse proportionality between the the harmlessness of the word or the legislation
[02:50:56.680 --> 02:51:02.440]  that's right stay there ad one final comment then uh delight honey it's time for dinner what are you
[02:51:02.440 --> 02:51:07.960]  doing over there on your computer i'm shopping for a new wallet mine is falling apart hey did you

[02:51:12.280 --> 02:51:17.240]  pickpocketing oh i didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pickpocketing what is that
[02:51:17.240 --> 02:51:22.280]  well apparently many of the new credit and debit cards being issued have radio chips inside them
[02:51:22.280 --> 02:51:28.200]  called rfid the transmitter banking information to card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad guy
[02:51:28.200 --> 02:51:32.520]  can also get one of these readers and go around the city scanning people collecting their credit
[02:51:32.520 --> 02:51:37.880]  card numbers and personal information without us knowing it wow that sounds scary since you're
[02:51:37.880 --> 02:51:42.360]  getting a new wallet anyway you should definitely get an id stronghold shielded wallet are they more

[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:10.280]  uh alex i think basically to sum it up the umbra which is the handlers of the bis
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:17.560]  are basically going to trigger a global reset or in other words a collapse by october and in order
[02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:23.960]  for them to do this they're going to create some type of mass bio issue or another you know
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:29.400]  vaccine agenda whatever it's going to be to get us to jump back into the boiling water we are
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:34.600]  frogs in the water the dune's day clock is at five seconds till i feel this coming karen here

[02:56:52.200 --> 02:56:56.680]  up i mean maybe it's not going to happen but i've never seen such pre build up real fast a comment
[02:56:56.680 --> 02:57:02.520]  to that and we're going to go to uh the Dwight wild jason and others uh linel you know we need to have
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:07.000]  your version of a builder bird and i always ask people this question you know we laugh about that
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:13.160]  but imagine if and you said this before imagine if the nfl uh owners met every year secretly since
[02:57:13.160 --> 02:57:21.480]  1954 or hollywood that is a beta test to see how will people look the other way and i think what
[02:57:21.480 --> 02:57:27.640]  would be would be great is if we could do a summit an actual summit imagine all of this all of your
[02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:35.640]  guests all of your your followers and patriot bird yes indeed or but but just to me you know alex
[02:57:35.640 --> 02:57:40.200]  this is the the question what people to think about is do you think and this is the bottom line
[02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:47.720]  do you think that the united states is not susceptible to or is impervious to that which happens
[02:57:47.720 --> 02:57:56.520]  elsewhere could your pension your bank account stocks your portfolio your wealth could it one day
[02:57:56.520 --> 02:58:04.600]  disappear because secretly americans believe that no it can't because somehow either we're blessed
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:10.760]  we're in the city on the hill that we are immune we are inoculated that this happens elsewhere but
[02:58:10.760 --> 02:58:16.760]  alex it's the same playing field well it's like japan building on a nuclear a nuclear plans on a
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:21.160]  fault line the tsunami zone and then lying and saying it's impossible for this to happen
[02:58:21.160 --> 02:58:25.640]  and general electric went along with it uh it's insanity i'm gonna come right back in 70 seconds
[02:58:25.640 --> 02:58:30.520]  and go right to the white and right to matthew jason wild and others uh so just be ready i'm
[02:58:30.520 --> 02:58:35.800]  gonna go to each person in order in fact it's the white wild then matthew so stay with us
[02:58:35.800 --> 02:58:40.200]  we'll be back in 70 seconds with your comment in question i may just do more overdrive with
[02:58:40.200 --> 02:58:44.280]  lionel this is some pretty good radio but uh pretty important stuff to debate maybe i'll let
[02:58:44.280 --> 02:58:49.400]  one of them post the show till 20 after and take calls because i've got to go to a meeting
[02:58:50.040 --> 02:58:54.280]  ladies and gentlemen you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my
[02:58:54.280 --> 02:58:59.320]  syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website info wars dot com because the
[02:58:59.320 --> 02:59:04.440]  companies i've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable
[02:59:04.440 --> 02:59:10.520]  as they should be so i refused probably 30 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then
[02:59:10.520 --> 02:59:17.080]  about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms hd firearms dot com own and run by a

[03:00:18.520 --> 03:00:26.200]  that liner is that old people thought that was a joke it's not a joke you have to realize you're
[03:00:26.200 --> 03:00:31.160]  behind enemy lines your country's been conquered by globalist only admitting the full scale allows
[03:00:31.160 --> 03:00:34.520]  us to do that we're going to do a 20 minutes overdrive to get to everybody in fact linel's
[03:00:34.520 --> 03:00:38.840]  going to host the show in the next segment and go to your calls he's a talk show us in his own
[03:00:38.840 --> 03:00:43.400]  right we're going to take a few calls right now dwight in colorado you're on the air then uh
[03:00:43.400 --> 03:00:50.120]  wild is next go ahead hey how you doing alex this is dwight going from denver colorado how
[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:54.680]  you doing brother i'm doing good to talk to you my friend thanks for holding yeah i just wanted
[03:00:54.680 --> 03:01:00.920]  to start off by saying i love what you guys do you guys are all true patriots and uh it's such a
[03:01:00.920 --> 03:01:08.600]  blessing uh listening to you guys it's awesome well thank you my uh i wanted to comment on the
[03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:14.680]  current financial crisis that's currently taking place in greece and my question for you and linel
[03:01:14.680 --> 03:01:21.960]  is do you think that this is going to be the filibuster to initiate the uh one world currency
[03:01:21.960 --> 03:01:31.240]  and uh rfid chipping in every single person i don't think yet but clearly they're now just
[03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:37.240]  turning everything into allison wonderland uh by design what's your take on that linel oh it's
[03:01:37.240 --> 03:01:44.840]  happening incrementally and it's happening by habituation and as um as uh as it will be said
[03:01:44.840 --> 03:01:49.720]  successive approximation which is basically the operant conditioning way of doing it little by
[03:01:49.720 --> 03:01:56.120]  little you become used to it because as far as the rfid chip goes it is becoming more and more
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:02:02.280]  a part of who we are and congratulations to you for turning people onto this the notion of trans
[03:02:02.280 --> 03:02:08.600]  humanism because what happens is we are going to one day be adorned with all of the jewelry and the
[03:02:08.600 --> 03:02:13.880]  accoutrement of our self-imposed prison and they're going to sell it as if it's cool in fact shifting
[03:02:13.880 --> 03:02:19.720]  gears what about a new york judge saying make all the prisoners have chips uh that's convicted next
[03:02:19.720 --> 03:02:26.200]  it'll be arrested just like dna testing inside their body to track them where they can't even remove
[03:02:26.200 --> 03:02:31.320]  the chips i guess in the spinal cord are in the brain and then the governor getting out there like
[03:02:31.320 --> 03:02:36.920]  they just won world war two because they caught these two killers when they just let 36 000 violent
[03:02:36.920 --> 03:02:42.520]  illegals out but they make this huge spectacle out of these two guys it's an example of how the media
[03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:49.160]  and the government can decide what to make a big deal and it also alex started by remember at first
[03:02:49.160 --> 03:02:54.200]  having your pet chipped and then later on they're going to say well you know mom and dad who might
[03:02:54.200 --> 03:03:00.600]  suffer from dementia will chip them and then let's get rid of an amber alert by chipping your child
[03:03:00.600 --> 03:03:05.320]  voluntarily of course and then if it's good enough for your dog and mom and dad and your kid
[03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:11.560]  what about you and then one day and it's been said a million times one day when you are found guilty
[03:03:11.560 --> 03:03:18.920]  or you are to be removed nobody needs to physically kill you they just turn your chip off and you don't
[03:03:18.920 --> 03:03:24.360]  exist try unable to buy and sell and they even say in these un documents and cartoons they've
[03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:28.840]  done for british kids to get them ready there'll be no cars those that are will be you know self
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:33.960]  driving for the elite very few you'll get meat once a year but the computer decides when you get
[03:03:33.960 --> 03:03:37.480]  health care you know the old bioethicist just killed people say we're not going to treat them
[03:03:37.480 --> 03:03:42.600]  now the computer just decides but i want to but i want to and it's the Watson computer the Nazis
[03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:47.000]  i mean you can't make it up but i want to see somebody one day with their smartphones say wait
[03:03:47.000 --> 03:03:54.440]  a minute alex i see you but it's not picking you up i don't see that beep you're not on the 24
[03:03:54.440 --> 03:04:00.840]  seven worldview panopticon you don't exist you know do you believe me or you're lying eyes
[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:07.880]  you will have no significance independent in terms of your flesh and don't think for a moment
[03:04:07.880 --> 03:04:13.720]  as we get more and more involved in in 3d apparatuses and virtual everything from
[03:04:13.720 --> 03:04:18.760]  virtual sex to virtual friendship they're gonna claim we're discriminating uh by criticizing
[03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:23.640]  virtual reality i i predict that'll be the new thing that if you criticize the second life type
[03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:27.880]  folks that live in la la land that you're being hateful to that group but finish your point we

[03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:47.560]  coming up he'll take four or five phone calls to finish its point but yes this is a planned
[03:04:47.560 --> 03:04:53.160]  takeover and it's not bored from star trek but might as well be but instead of just invading us
[03:04:53.160 --> 03:04:58.600]  with laser beams and taking over they're doing it by seducing us with trojan horse

[03:08:53.720 --> 03:09:04.440]  sir wild in wisconsin going once you hear me now going twice how about matthew and said matthew
[03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:12.440]  you're on the alex jones show so yes sir um how are you doing today man fine sir
[03:09:13.720 --> 03:09:20.600]  matthew what is on your mind i just well i would like to focus on our root causes
[03:09:20.600 --> 03:09:26.920]  of how we got to this point and i think it would better understand you know how we got here
[03:09:27.480 --> 03:09:33.640]  would be able to better approach the future and how to change that now there's um
[03:09:34.440 --> 03:09:38.840]  there's a lady and her name is ashley sanders are you familiar with her with move to amend
[03:09:39.640 --> 03:09:47.160]  no sir no well she's out of salt lake city well and um the thing is is that she goes off
[03:09:47.160 --> 03:09:54.840]  on how uh corporates corporations got personhood here in america hey matthew may i ask you a
[03:09:54.840 --> 03:09:59.880]  question matthew i don't want to interrupt and i'm sure she is fantastic but since i've got you on
[03:09:59.880 --> 03:10:05.400]  the phone may i ask you what your particular ideology is in your particular thoughts irrespective
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:12.840]  of somebody else's what do you think sir regarding the problems that we face well what i believe is
[03:10:12.840 --> 03:10:19.160]  that corporations are not people and money is not speech and there's um you know that's a big issue
[03:10:19.160 --> 03:10:26.920]  in this you know today's uh economy and our and the way that that our policies are being driven up
[03:10:26.920 --> 03:10:33.640]  and backdoor deals and now today it turned into one dollar one vote rather than what it's supposed
[03:10:33.640 --> 03:10:38.840]  to be you know rather than what the public needs it to be and before it used to be a felony for
[03:10:38.840 --> 03:10:46.440]  corporations to contribute one penny to uh political campaigning and all that knowledge
[03:10:46.440 --> 03:10:52.760]  just becomes you know regular practice let me ask you a question yes let me ask you a question
[03:10:52.760 --> 03:10:58.840]  if i could sir let's assume that alex jones incorporated were to be a viable as he is
[03:10:58.840 --> 03:11:05.880]  political movement and alex jones incorporated wanted to to um to contribute don't you think the
[03:11:05.880 --> 03:11:12.200]  real answer to get around the citizens united problem is just disclosure let a corporation
[03:11:12.200 --> 03:11:18.280]  donate let a corporation involve itself in the system but let's find out who the corporation
[03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:24.520]  is and how much they're actually contributing do you think that's a way around it right maybe
[03:11:24.520 --> 03:11:29.720]  maybe open books but you know that's that's the thing it's like well we could go ahead and ask
[03:11:29.720 --> 03:11:35.480]  for disclosure but we're only going to be told so much you know what and the thing is is that if
[03:11:35.480 --> 03:11:41.400]  there was complete transparency like there i mean at one point within the first 75 years of this
[03:11:41.400 --> 03:11:45.880]  country you had to actually go to be able to get incorporated you had to go down to your to your
[03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:52.120]  local senators and actually convince them how your business was going to benefit the
[03:11:52.120 --> 03:11:57.320]  Matthew Matthew my friend you make some excellent points i certainly thank you for your call let's
[03:11:57.320 --> 03:12:05.800]  go right now to uh jason who's calling jason you're on the alex jones show jason right i thought
[03:12:06.520 --> 03:12:13.080]  rich are you there sir you're on the alex jones show yeah how you doing lyle um really peoed man
[03:12:13.080 --> 03:12:19.480]  and what i want to know is this this is treason plain and simple across the board
[03:12:20.120 --> 03:12:25.080]  well tpp all the things that have been going on these documents that they were revealed
[03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:31.000]  the treasonous and the people do who are letting it happen are abetting treason i don't understand
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:35.880]  why why a department isn't there any department for example the sheriff's department has more
[03:12:35.880 --> 03:12:41.240]  power on the state than the president does okay and they can deputize where they need to deputize
[03:12:41.240 --> 03:12:47.160]  when they can't handle a situation that's beyond their singular means uh why can't this happen
[03:12:47.160 --> 03:12:52.360]  why can't we arrest these people like we've been in the good old days arrest these people try them
[03:12:52.360 --> 03:12:57.880]  and and find them guilty of treason that's what this is and it just keeps going on and i don't
[03:12:57.880 --> 03:13:02.840]  understand why i don't appreciate that but the but the problem that exists is that if you were to
[03:13:02.840 --> 03:13:09.480]  try to do that you were to say okay let us argue let us go and declare this to be unconstitutional
[03:13:10.120 --> 03:13:17.400]  let's try to get the supreme court to grant us certiorari let us bring a case against the government
[03:13:17.400 --> 03:13:22.840]  saying that this is a violation of the treaties provision or some particular aspect of the constitution
[03:13:22.840 --> 03:13:28.520]  the supreme court then grants certiorari or the right of review but something tells me
[03:13:28.520 --> 03:13:34.760]  that the supreme court based upon the current framework is going to merely say this is within
[03:13:34.760 --> 03:13:40.440]  the province of the legislature this is within the province of the president this is within the
[03:13:40.440 --> 03:13:47.240]  realm of possibilities of legislation and even though you may not agree with it what your remedy
[03:13:47.240 --> 03:13:54.040]  is is to kick somebody out of office this is a political question you know the word treason is
[03:13:54.040 --> 03:14:00.840]  something which is a fascinating subject the idea to me that something is so reprehensible so so
[03:14:00.840 --> 03:14:06.680]  contrary to the rudiments of this country and to the bases of this constitution i would venture to
[03:14:06.680 --> 03:14:14.360]  say that that word means virtually nothing today the thing that i don't understand and this is the
[03:14:14.360 --> 03:14:20.760]  part that i have talked to alex about and and others as well is that there was a time when we
[03:14:20.760 --> 03:14:27.160]  as the united states were the only game in town and we thought about what really affected us
[03:14:27.720 --> 03:14:33.960]  what was it that affected us and our way of thinking and our livelihood did it present a
[03:14:33.960 --> 03:14:40.040]  clear and present danger to us not something theoretical because ask yourself what was the
[03:14:40.040 --> 03:14:47.560]  last engagement the last war the last military action that we ever got involved in that dealt with
[03:14:47.560 --> 03:14:54.360]  a real and true threat to this country something that was direct and absolute i'm still waiting
[03:14:54.920 --> 03:15:03.000]  you know i was here on that terrible day in uh 2001 on september the 11th and i was here and i
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:11.400]  remember i remember how i felt but i remember at the time how being a part of this and the smell
[03:15:11.400 --> 03:15:19.320]  and the sound and the attitude that lingered in new york i remember the time thinking i don't care
[03:15:19.320 --> 03:15:25.720]  who was responsible for this i wanted to get them and i'll never forget this because now i look back
[03:15:25.720 --> 03:15:33.400]  and they say it almost um i'm almost ashamed of what i thought because i i was so angry and it
[03:15:33.400 --> 03:15:39.320]  didn't really matter who was involved whether afghanistan was involved or whether or iraq it
[03:15:39.320 --> 03:15:45.320]  didn't matter to me and then after the fact after the smoke cleared literally and actually
[03:15:45.880 --> 03:15:53.880]  after i started to read and after i awakened and woke up and saw what was going on i realized
[03:15:53.880 --> 03:16:01.000]  that i had this particular piece of terror used as a fulcrum as a wedge it was used against me
[03:16:01.560 --> 03:16:07.560]  to lure me into going along and just signing off on this and then little by little i found out
[03:16:07.560 --> 03:16:15.880]  that these people these countries that were allegedly responsible for this horror that i saw
[03:16:15.880 --> 03:16:24.200]  and felt and experienced that afghanistan lo and behold happened to be the saudi arabia saw the
[03:16:24.200 --> 03:16:31.880]  saudi arabia rather of lythium isn't that amazing and that all of these countries that miraculously
[03:16:31.880 --> 03:16:40.360]  were involved somehow tangentially or theoretically with 9 11 all of them had tremendous assets
[03:16:40.360 --> 03:16:47.080]  that other people wanted and the great gerald salenti said it best and at that time he said
[03:16:47.080 --> 03:16:53.480]  it still does what do you think the chances of us ever involved or invading iraq if they if the
[03:16:53.480 --> 03:17:01.480]  major export was broccoli and little by little i realized oh my god and from that moment on i'll
[03:17:01.480 --> 03:17:08.040]  never forget this something happened to me and it's happened to you as well and alex in many
[03:17:08.040 --> 03:17:15.400]  respects was responsible for turning my ignition switch on of making me aware of what's going on
[03:17:15.400 --> 03:17:21.000]  you know you talk about what's treasonous i see right now something that is very easy for people
[03:17:21.000 --> 03:17:27.240]  to understand very easy and it's just wonderful thing called the bill of rights this wonderful
[03:17:27.240 --> 03:17:34.680]  aspect of the constitution that people will argue whether they have a a bead on what it is or not
[03:17:34.680 --> 03:17:40.440]  or that they really truly understand it and i am seeing the first amendment and the second
[03:17:40.440 --> 03:17:44.920]  amendment for sure the third amendment we haven't had much of a problem with that quartering soldiers
[03:17:44.920 --> 03:17:49.480]  at your home against your will but fourth amendment search and seizure and fifth amendment in due
[03:17:49.480 --> 03:17:56.760]  process all of them are systematically being eroded a little by little bit by bit and if all
[03:17:56.760 --> 03:18:02.520]  is said and done when we look back on this wonderful civilization of ours this is going to be
[03:18:02.520 --> 03:18:09.320]  me the thing that changed everything i always ask this and i want you to think about this and i
[03:18:09.320 --> 03:18:13.720]  appreciate alex allowing me the chance to do this but i want you to imagine if you could
[03:18:13.720 --> 03:18:21.400]  meet hamilton or jefferson or madison today or george orwell mr blare and you could have a
[03:18:21.400 --> 03:18:27.480]  conversation with them what would you tell them what would freak them out what would rock their
[03:18:27.480 --> 03:18:35.000]  world and if ever i met eric blare uh george orwell i would say remember how you wrote 1984
[03:18:35.560 --> 03:18:41.160]  and you envisioned the enemy being the state kind of stuzzy like
[03:18:41.960 --> 03:18:48.920]  where you imagine the state and the secret police breaking in and leaving a microphone
[03:18:48.920 --> 03:18:56.200]  next to the wall socket or next to the coffee maker remember when you imagine the government
[03:18:56.200 --> 03:19:04.040]  actively surveilling us by breaking in and breaking the cartilage as we lawyers refer to the area
[03:19:04.040 --> 03:19:11.320]  around your home well this changed everything because what we did when we signed on to this
[03:19:11.320 --> 03:19:20.600]  we accepted its its irresponsibility so to speak and whenever we had a new app or we wanted to be
[03:19:20.600 --> 03:19:26.440]  known and we wanted to use gps and we wanted to have these things these these wonderful little
[03:19:26.440 --> 03:19:34.440]  tools and gadgets and gizmos we signed on and we took the fourth amendment and we gave it away
[03:19:35.080 --> 03:19:41.160]  that's what i would say well on behalf of a grateful nation thank you to alex jones thank you and to
[03:19:41.160 --> 03:19:46.840]  his tremendous staff thank you as well i am so honored to be a part of this follow me on twitter
[03:19:46.840 --> 03:19:59.880]  at lionel media and i hope to be with you again as soon as possible thank you so much
