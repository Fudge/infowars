[00:00:02.626 --> 00:00:04.147]  It's Sunday, November 26, 2023.
[00:00:04.147 --> 00:00:07.389]  Prepare yourselves for reality.
[00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:09.470]  Prepare yourselves to face the truth.
[00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:10.170]  Prepare yourselves.
[00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:37.030]  Hi, it's Luna, activist teacher here, and I know that everyone is getting ready to celebrate Thanksgiving in America, but I want to remind people that this is a white supremacist holiday for genocidal maniacs.
[00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.031]  We can have different political views, but we have one view.
[00:00:40.031 --> 00:00:44.093]  The one view is we're the finest, greatest nation in the world.
[00:00:44.093 --> 00:00:47.574]  Stand up against the poison of white supremacists.
[00:00:47.574 --> 00:00:49.955]  I did my inaugural address to a single out
[00:00:50.734 --> 00:00:54.538]  As the FBI and DHS ignore their sworn duty in order to fuel the narrative of white supremacy,
[00:01:09.775 --> 00:01:17.805]  They broke the law, came in and occupied the Cannon Office House building, interrupted Congress, interrupted hearings.
[00:01:17.805 --> 00:01:23.431]  Right here, Katrina Bleakley is the lead attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:01:23.431 --> 00:01:24.332]  Were you aware of this?
[00:01:24.753 --> 00:01:27.355]  I don't spend a lot of time on Twitter.
[00:01:27.355 --> 00:01:29.416]  Oh, I'm sure you do.
[00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:29.736]  Right.
[00:01:29.736 --> 00:01:34.439]  Mr. Wray, you should be interested in investigating terrorism.
[00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.963]  And this right here is proof that we had terrorists in our own office building.
[00:01:39.963 --> 00:01:41.624]  Global Intifada.
[00:01:41.624 --> 00:01:43.925]  And you rely on the Southern Poverty Law Centers.
[00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:46.207]  Katrina Bleakley is one of the organizers.
[00:01:46.587 --> 00:02:01.510]  I'll send this over to your office so maybe perhaps you can stop targeting innocent grandmothers and veterans who walked through the Capitol on January 6th and might actually go after people tied to Hamas, tied to Hezbollah, and likely Iran.
[00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.012]  Our primary mission is a little group called Quiet Skies.
[00:02:05.012 --> 00:02:11.196]  It's a mission called Quiet Skies that we're following people that flew into the National Capital Region in January 2021.
[00:02:11.196 --> 00:02:14.378]  You did not have to go to the Capitol or the rally.
[00:02:14.378 --> 00:02:23.064]  And you've been put on a specific list that TSA now has assigned air marshals to follow these people who have not had any type of criminal investigation.
[00:02:23.064 --> 00:02:24.605]  They haven't committed a crime.
[00:02:24.605 --> 00:02:28.788]  But yet three years later, we're following the same individuals day in and day out.
[00:02:28.788 --> 00:02:30.409]  They're not tracking terrorists at all?
[00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.670]  Well, they didn't even have to be at the Capitol, Carly.
[00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.830]  They could have just flown into the National Capitol region.
[00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:41.732]  So if anybody was there for a job interview, to visit family, we even had a gentleman that was there for a funeral.
[00:02:41.732 --> 00:02:47.734]  They put on this domestic terrorist list just because of their geographic location to Washington, D.C.
[00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:49.555]  So these people did not even commit a crime.
[00:02:49.555 --> 00:02:50.715]  They weren't even at the Capitol.
[00:02:51.175 --> 00:02:51.636]  What?
[00:02:51.636 --> 00:02:53.858]  Do those people know that they're on this list?
[00:02:53.858 --> 00:03:00.484]  Some of them do, because when they go to the airport, they get the Qantas on their boarding pass, and then they have to go through enhanced security.
[00:03:00.484 --> 00:03:04.567]  Then they're followed by teams of air marshals on any leg of flight that they have.
[00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:15.778]  Those radicalized by state propaganda through the Mockingbird Media, anti-American politicians, and funding by George Soros are morphing into their own cells of dangerous domestic terrorism.
[00:03:19.292 --> 00:03:20.793]  I'm in U.S.
[00:03:20.793 --> 00:03:21.814]  right now.
[00:03:21.814 --> 00:03:22.915]  I'm in Manhattan.
[00:03:22.915 --> 00:03:23.656]  U.S.
[00:03:23.656 --> 00:03:25.377]  is a f***ing evil.
[00:03:25.377 --> 00:03:27.839]  One day, we will take U.S.
[00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:31.102]  All the Muslims will destroy U.S.
[00:03:31.102 --> 00:03:33.684]  and we will rule the world.
[00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:37.688]  I watch Israel people die and I masturbate with them.
[00:03:37.688 --> 00:03:38.649]  Wow.
[00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:39.910]  What do you think about the Jewish people?
[00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:40.871]  They're dirty.
[00:03:41.852 --> 00:03:42.592]  I hate them.
[00:03:42.592 --> 00:03:43.952]  I just like killing Jews.
[00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:47.113]  I raped them first, then I killed them.
[00:03:47.113 --> 00:03:48.073]  There's a difference.
[00:03:48.073 --> 00:04:02.976]  The government appears to be going through the throes of a soft coup, where the Democratic Party foolishly intends on emerging as the saviors as future terrorism ignites a martial law state and unvetted illegal aliens are given the right to vote.
[00:04:02.976 --> 00:04:11.478]  It's far more threatening to our republic if our own government facilitates criminal invasion
[00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:35.635]  And it is incredibly threatening to our citizenry if our government's highest levels of law enforcement coordinate organized campaigns of weaponized oppression, harassment, investigation, arrest, and prosecution, and imprisonment of free Americans.
[00:04:35.635 --> 00:04:39.339]  That, Mr. Chairman, is a primary threat.
[00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:43.460]  A homeland indeed faces today.
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.603]  Simple math places the Uniparty and their fellow minions in the unelected federal bureaucracy as the greatest threat to the United States.
[00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:55.065]  It is the Uniparty that has become radicalized.
[00:04:55.065 --> 00:04:57.125]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:57.125 --> 00:04:58.506]  We'll be back at Sunday Light.
[00:05:01.198 --> 00:05:04.340]  Thanksgiving 2023 is here.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.764]  And I'm giving Thanksgiving for all we've done against tyranny and your incredible support together in this fight.
[00:05:09.764 --> 00:05:21.692]  And I'm particularly giving Thanksgiving that X2, our number one product, the only true atomic iodine on the market after a year plus of being sold out, is finally back in stock, ready to ship now.
[00:05:21.692 --> 00:05:26.295]  If you don't know the power of X2 and the iodine conspiracy, you are insane.
[00:05:26.295 --> 00:05:27.396]  Get X2 now.
[00:05:27.396 --> 00:05:28.476]  It could be the last run ever.
[00:05:28.476 --> 00:05:29.657]  We get shut down.
[00:05:29.657 --> 00:05:30.518]  While you still can,
[00:05:31.538 --> 00:05:39.502]  At InfoWarsTore.com, research iodine deficiency and billions of people with cognitive disabilities because they don't have it.
[00:05:39.502 --> 00:05:40.623]  X2.
[00:05:40.623 --> 00:05:41.703]  X2.
[00:05:41.703 --> 00:05:45.025]  X2 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:48.247]  It takes a few weeks to kick in, but it is the building block to everything.
[00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:48.967]  It's the missing link.
[00:05:48.967 --> 00:05:53.489]  They bomb us with the fluoride that is in the same family, but has the opposite effect.
[00:05:53.489 --> 00:05:57.171]  This is the holy grail of supplements and empowering yourself.
[00:05:57.171 --> 00:05:58.912]  X2, back in stock right now.
[00:05:58.912 --> 00:06:00.033]  Discount at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:06:05.499 --> 00:06:06.843]  It's Sunday, November 26, 2023.
[00:06:09.219 --> 00:06:18.967]  344 days, 7 hours, 54 minutes, 0 seconds until the most important election, not in U.S., but in world history.
[00:06:18.967 --> 00:06:20.148]  No one can deny it.
[00:06:20.148 --> 00:06:21.609]  That's not hype.
[00:06:21.609 --> 00:06:23.991]  That is a fact.
[00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:29.655]  And InfoWars is still at the tip of the spear, still in the fight, only because of listeners and viewers.
[00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:37.081]  And your support and your word of mouth and your prayers, I salute and humbly thank you all and ask you to redouble your efforts tonight.
[00:06:39.602 --> 00:06:42.523]  Oh, wow.
[00:06:42.523 --> 00:06:45.924]  We've got a lot to cover tonight.
[00:06:45.924 --> 00:06:58.469]  Every day I see an article out of Ohio or New Jersey or Texas or Connecticut or California or Minnesota or New Mexico or Oklahoma.
[00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:59.570]  I mean, I've got a big stack.
[00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:00.890]  Or Georgia.
[00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.751]  I've got a big stack here in front of me.
[00:07:04.383 --> 00:07:04.844]  I don't know.
[00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:16.520]  Breaking!
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.484]  A federal judge appointed by Obama just ruled against voting machines in Georgia.
[00:07:21.484 --> 00:07:33.094]  The machine's cybersecurity flaws violate the constitutional rights of the voters and said that, in a footnote, that this is not a conspiracy theory and the people that filed this are not conspiracy theorists.
[00:07:33.094 --> 00:07:35.096]  I've got the rulings more right here.
[00:07:35.096 --> 00:07:39.159]  Iowa County Supervisor's wife convicted 52 counts of voter fraud.
[00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:41.942]  It goes on and on.
[00:07:41.942 --> 00:07:46.566]  We've got other forms of voter suppression that are happening, and it's all a one-way street, man.
[00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:57.516]  It's Democrats, Democrats, Democrats, Democrats doing the deed, because they know there's been a massive political, cultural, spiritual realignment against them.
[00:07:57.516 --> 00:08:02.300]  Not that Republicans are perfect, but that's where the beachhead of populism got a toehold.
[00:08:04.733 --> 00:08:10.496]  I know an elected official convicted a massive voter fraud with fake names, folks.
[00:08:10.496 --> 00:08:11.156]  Fake ballots.
[00:08:11.156 --> 00:08:13.137]  Well, real ballots with fake names on them.
[00:08:13.137 --> 00:08:16.138]  The good old Democrat playbook, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:16.138 --> 00:08:18.580]  And why is this all going on?
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.420]  Well, Bernie Madoff, you know what happened to him.
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.941]  You know what's happened to Sam Binkman Freed.
[00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:25.303]  You know what Ponzi schemes are.
[00:08:25.303 --> 00:08:27.624]  But the private Federal Reserve owned by European banks
[00:08:29.298 --> 00:08:32.702]  Makes all those other Ponzi schemes look pale in significance.
[00:08:32.702 --> 00:08:37.887]  Or pale in significance, not pale as in white skin, but pale as in falling down.
[00:08:37.887 --> 00:08:39.188]  Look at this.
[00:08:39.188 --> 00:08:40.950]  Here's federal numbers from the U.S.
[00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:42.251]  government.
[00:08:42.251 --> 00:08:43.753]  From the Federal Reserve.
[00:08:43.753 --> 00:08:47.717]  Look at the rate of debt.
[00:08:47.717 --> 00:08:49.479]  Upwards of 40% of the U.S.
[00:08:49.479 --> 00:08:51.040]  budget now.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.342]  That's a hyperbolic curve.
[00:08:54.215 --> 00:08:54.395]  Yes.
[00:09:18.453 --> 00:09:20.055]  Incredible levels of control.
[00:09:20.055 --> 00:09:21.297]  We've got that news.
[00:09:21.297 --> 00:09:25.963]  We've got huge news with populists and anti-globalists being elected around the world.
[00:09:25.963 --> 00:09:27.585]  I've got some numbers here we'll be going over.
[00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:40.251]  We've also got multiple members of Congress coming right out and saying America's been hijacked by the New World Order, by globalists, and we've got to kick the WEF-UN controllers out.
[00:09:40.251 --> 00:09:43.634]  We've got to stop their operations.
[00:09:43.634 --> 00:09:45.977]  We've got to block their treaties.
[00:09:45.977 --> 00:09:47.778]  Yes, people are getting it.
[00:09:47.778 --> 00:09:49.000]  It's so simple.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.081]  Declare sovereignty.
[00:09:50.081 --> 00:09:51.042]  Say no to the globalists.
[00:09:51.502 --> 00:09:54.103]  Turn our energy, our fertilizer back on.
[00:09:54.103 --> 00:09:59.825]  We can feed the world and export freedom and save the world with ideas, not with troops.
[00:09:59.825 --> 00:10:02.966]  But our troops don't export American freedom, they export globalism.
[00:10:02.966 --> 00:10:07.508]  The Afghans came out of a congressional study after the collapse a few years ago.
[00:10:07.508 --> 00:10:12.449]  The main reason, they had a big international group go in and survey over 100,000 Afghans.
[00:10:12.449 --> 00:10:14.050]  Why did you resist America?
[00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:15.850]  Why did you turn against America?
[00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.692]  And the number one reason was, you taught that men can have babies.
[00:10:20.754 --> 00:10:24.117]  And that we should cut our son's penises off.
[00:10:24.117 --> 00:10:25.878]  That's not how you win hearts and minds.
[00:10:25.878 --> 00:10:33.604]  Oh, we're here to teach you two men can have a baby, and that pedophilia is good, and that we're going to cut your son's genitals off.
[00:10:33.604 --> 00:10:37.047]  And that leads me now to this video.
[00:10:37.047 --> 00:10:41.170]  A vast pedophile network, Senator Josh Hawley, decries
[00:10:42.819 --> 00:10:44.519]  The point is, this is a pedophile empire.
[00:11:06.516 --> 00:11:13.403]  If you're a globalist who wants to rob and steal and destroy the next generation, you want to physically rape them too.
[00:11:13.403 --> 00:11:15.605]  We've got some more pedo news we're going to hit here in a moment.
[00:11:15.605 --> 00:11:30.099]  First, just to remind you that the deep state worldwide, the CIA, speaking of Afghanistan admitted, looked this up, that in hundreds of towns and cities in Afghanistan, same thing in Iraq, they would find a convicted pedophile.
[00:11:31.044 --> 00:11:41.280]  And make them the mayor and then feed them children and use that to control them because they found you give somebody money, but they may still ideologically go against you.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.562]  Or even blackmail their family.
[00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.984]  Threaten their family, but if it's a pedophile, they'll follow the orders as long as you supply them children.
[00:11:49.984 --> 00:11:54.968]  Headline, CIA supplied children to Afghan leaders.
[00:11:54.968 --> 00:11:56.409]  That's your government.
[00:11:56.409 --> 00:11:57.950]  That's who they are.
[00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:59.191]  That's what they're doing.
[00:11:59.191 --> 00:12:00.772]  Here is Senator Josh Hawley.
[00:12:02.312 --> 00:12:03.393]  Senator Hawley.
[00:12:03.393 --> 00:12:04.594]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Behar.
[00:12:04.594 --> 00:12:05.835]  Thank you again for being here.
[00:12:05.835 --> 00:12:10.418]  I just want to first establish a fact or two, just to make sure everybody understands.
[00:12:10.418 --> 00:12:23.507]  So on October the 5th, 2021, you composed an email, which is now, I think, in the record, to Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and a group of other executives at Meta.
[00:12:23.507 --> 00:12:24.148]  Am I right so far?
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.421]  That's correct.
[00:12:34.895 --> 00:12:40.199]  Had experienced unwanted sexual advances within the last 7 days, is that correct?
[00:12:40.199 --> 00:12:40.739]  That's correct.
[00:12:40.739 --> 00:12:47.204]  And about 1 in 3, I think it was 27%, had experienced unwanted sexual advances outside of the 7 day window.
[00:12:47.204 --> 00:12:50.206]  So that is more than 7 days, is that correct?
[00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:50.706]  That is correct.
[00:12:50.706 --> 00:12:52.007]  Those numbers are astounding.
[00:12:52.007 --> 00:12:53.508]  I just want to let that sink in.
[00:12:53.508 --> 00:12:59.532]  1 in 8, within 7 days, a third of children outside of that window.
[00:12:59.532 --> 00:13:01.274]  Mark Zuckerberg, did he reply to you?
[00:13:01.914 --> 00:13:02.895]  He did not reply.
[00:13:02.895 --> 00:13:04.376]  Did he meet with you?
[00:13:04.376 --> 00:13:05.977]  He did not meet with me.
[00:13:05.977 --> 00:13:08.218]  Sheryl Sandberg, did she meet with you?
[00:13:08.218 --> 00:13:09.159]  She did not meet with me.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:22.409]  So, in other words, the people who had recruited you to come back to Facebook, Meta, whatever, sorry to keep up, they ignored your findings.
[00:13:22.409 --> 00:13:25.572]  When you presented data to them they didn't want to see, they turned a blind eye.
[00:13:25.572 --> 00:13:26.592]  Let me ask you about something else.
[00:13:26.592 --> 00:13:30.275]  This is from the Wall Street Journal's report earlier this year.
[00:13:30.275 --> 00:13:31.836]  This is June of this year.
[00:13:31.836 --> 00:13:32.917]  They found the following.
[00:13:32.917 --> 00:13:33.417]  I'm going to quote.
[00:13:34.298 --> 00:13:44.525]  Instagram helps connect and promote a vast network of accounts openly devoted to the commission and purchase of underage sex content.
[00:13:44.525 --> 00:13:56.594]  Pedophiles have long used the internet, but unlike the forums and file transfer services that cater to people who have an interest in illicit content, Instagram doesn't merely host these activities.
[00:13:56.594 --> 00:13:59.156]  Instagram's algorithms promote them.
[00:14:00.279 --> 00:14:12.067]  Instagram connects pedophiles and guides them to content sellers via recommendation systems that excel at linking those who share these interests, the journal and academic researchers found.
[00:14:12.067 --> 00:14:16.450]  This is a stunning, stunning report, Mr. Behar, that more than
[00:14:17.768 --> 00:14:26.796]  Buttresses bears out what you were telling trying to tell the executives who ignored you to just give us a sense what in your own view Why do you think this is happening?
[00:14:26.796 --> 00:14:31.280]  Why has Instagram become in the words of the Wall Street Journal a vast pedophile network?
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:35.383]  Why are people like your daughter every time they get on Instagram?
[00:14:35.383 --> 00:14:39.567]  They're being bombarded with unwanted sexual advances sexual content.
[00:14:39.567 --> 00:14:41.869]  Why is this happening?
[00:14:41.869 --> 00:14:43.731]  my experience of that is that
[00:14:45.106 --> 00:14:52.949]  Most of the resources, close to all that they invest in this, go towards this very narrow definition of harm.
[00:14:52.949 --> 00:15:04.253]  And so I would encourage anybody here, when you're looking at this issue, if you find an account that seems to be a pedophile account selling things, try and act on it.
[00:15:04.253 --> 00:15:05.893]  Try and raise it.
[00:15:05.893 --> 00:15:07.514]  See what the company does with that.
[00:15:08.663 --> 00:15:19.640]  But see what happens if you like it or follow it, what you start getting recommended, and of all of the things that get surfaced by the systems, how many of them are they acting on?
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.823]  It's a fraction of a percent.
[00:15:23.183 --> 00:15:38.686]  One of the things that you said changed from the time you left Facebook in 2015, I think it was, and came back in 2019, was that Facebook has shifted to an automated-driven process of safety standards, safety inspection, monitoring for things like this, which they boast about.
[00:15:38.686 --> 00:15:42.147]  They say that their AI is great, it's doing great work.
[00:15:42.147 --> 00:15:45.088]  That doesn't appear, however, to be the actual fact.
[00:15:45.088 --> 00:15:46.868]  It appears that these harms are proliferating.
[00:15:46.868 --> 00:15:49.329]  Tell us about the shift towards automated
[00:15:51.030 --> 00:16:02.759]  I was not there for the shift, but what I can say is that algorithms are as good as their inputs.
[00:16:02.759 --> 00:16:08.283]  So if you don't allow a child to be, oh, that is gross, it makes me uncomfortable,
[00:16:09.209 --> 00:16:09.589]  Right?
[00:16:09.589 --> 00:16:12.310]  Which is something that you can do for an ad today.
[00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:16.071]  You can take an ad and say, that is sexually inappropriate.
[00:16:16.071 --> 00:16:20.813]  But there's no way for a child to do that when they get a message or other areas.
[00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:26.355]  How do these systems, like even have a hope of addressing... Hit pause.
[00:16:26.355 --> 00:16:28.036]  Back it up 20 seconds.
[00:16:28.036 --> 00:16:29.396]  This is the most key thing.
[00:16:29.396 --> 00:16:30.937]  They've got this top computer scientist.
[00:16:30.937 --> 00:16:32.918]  He used to work for Facebook, now Meta.
[00:16:32.918 --> 00:16:33.578]  They brought him back.
[00:16:34.676 --> 00:16:36.696]  And he's saying they're acting like the A.I.
[00:16:36.696 --> 00:16:37.837]  is doing all this.
[00:16:37.837 --> 00:16:38.257]  It's not.
[00:16:38.257 --> 00:16:44.658]  It's programming it to cover it up and act like it's being dealt with so they can generate reports that cover it up.
[00:16:44.658 --> 00:17:00.221]  Because a child, when it sees pedophilic material sent to them or other horrible things, snuff films, you name it, and it's everywhere, folks, they don't know to go into the Terms of Service and click eight links and send a message and say something.
[00:17:00.221 --> 00:17:01.541]  They don't even know it's wrong.
[00:17:01.541 --> 00:17:02.161]  They're innocent.
[00:17:03.018 --> 00:17:06.600]  That's why a child can't join the military until they're an adult.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:06.921]  Eighteen.
[00:17:06.921 --> 00:17:08.281]  You can't buy cigarettes until you're eighteen.
[00:17:08.281 --> 00:17:10.203]  You can't buy alcohol until you're twenty-one.
[00:17:10.203 --> 00:17:12.824]  Because we've decided, hey, this is so dangerous.
[00:17:12.824 --> 00:17:14.906]  And, you know, that makes sense, folks.
[00:17:14.906 --> 00:17:21.050]  I mean, I was pretty smart at seventeen, but still, I mean, God, I know a hundred times more than I knew then.
[00:17:21.050 --> 00:17:23.311]  And you know how that works.
[00:17:23.311 --> 00:17:24.412]  That's why they say that, you know.
[00:17:25.618 --> 00:17:27.119]  Health and beauty is wasted on the youth.
[00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:30.423]  As you get older, you figure this stuff out, or you actually get worse in some cases.
[00:17:30.423 --> 00:17:31.604]  People go down two paths.
[00:17:31.604 --> 00:17:33.465]  They get worse and dumber, or they get smarter.
[00:17:33.465 --> 00:17:33.886]  More wise.
[00:17:35.370 --> 00:17:36.691]  So he's saying they don't know.
[00:17:36.691 --> 00:17:37.531]  They don't know.
[00:17:37.531 --> 00:17:44.596]  Would you just throw your child in a park with thousands of weird men and women dressed up like clowns that say they're into sex with kids?
[00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:47.517]  Oh, it's liberal, but that's what drag queen story time is.
[00:17:47.517 --> 00:17:52.020]  We just throw them out and say, well, it's their decision whether they want to be with an adult.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:57.143]  They can make, because there's no age of consent, because they're getting rid of that.
[00:17:57.143 --> 00:17:58.564]  But children can't contract.
[00:17:58.564 --> 00:17:59.925]  They can't make those decisions.
[00:18:01.533 --> 00:18:02.814]  They don't have the gauge yet.
[00:18:02.814 --> 00:18:03.734]  They haven't been taught.
[00:18:03.734 --> 00:18:10.717]  They haven't been informed by their guardians, by their family, by their village, by their neighbors, by their grandparents.
[00:18:10.717 --> 00:18:17.599]  But that's the left taught in the 50s, 60s, 70s with Dr. Spock is do not go.
[00:18:17.599 --> 00:18:20.961]  Do not teach your children.
[00:18:20.961 --> 00:18:22.541]  Let them be their own person.
[00:18:22.541 --> 00:18:24.122]  Well, they didn't want them to be their own person.
[00:18:24.122 --> 00:18:26.203]  They want to program who they are.
[00:18:26.203 --> 00:18:26.583]  Continue.
[00:18:27.892 --> 00:18:37.376]  For an ad today, you can take an ad and say that is sexually inappropriate, but there's no way for a child to do that when they get a message or other areas.
[00:18:37.376 --> 00:18:48.922]  How do these systems, like even have a hope of addressing these issues, how can they as a company have a hope of addressing these issues if they're not willing to listen when a teen is trying to tell them
[00:18:49.642 --> 00:18:54.084]  That they're experiencing gross content, unwanted sexual advances.
[00:18:54.084 --> 00:18:56.486]  I mean, that's how you find predators.
[00:18:56.486 --> 00:18:58.587]  That's how you find the bad... Oh, hit pause again.
[00:18:58.587 --> 00:19:02.409]  Back up 10 seconds.
[00:19:02.409 --> 00:19:03.049]  They've got AI.
[00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:07.091]  See, there's not even a person for them to even talk to.
[00:19:07.091 --> 00:19:07.952]  And it's gotten worse.
[00:19:07.952 --> 00:19:11.934]  But they're busy fighting white supremacy.
[00:19:11.934 --> 00:19:16.216]  They're busy suppressing Republican voter data.
[00:19:16.216 --> 00:19:17.897]  They're busy hiding the Hunter Biden laptop.
[00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:22.792]  Because it's all about wrecking your children's brains.
[00:19:22.792 --> 00:19:33.338]  The more they can show you some horrible thing and create trauma, because it goes against your human programming, the more they've got a relationship with you.
[00:19:33.338 --> 00:19:36.500]  But the good news is that they spent 18 million or more on their meta program.
[00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:37.641]  It failed.
[00:19:37.641 --> 00:19:39.522]  But it's literally a pedophile palace.
[00:19:39.522 --> 00:19:42.524]  Remember when Meta first launched, pedophiles flooded it, hoping to find kids?
[00:19:44.667 --> 00:19:47.428]  Predators, that's how you find the bad things.
[00:20:04.215 --> 00:20:13.300]  And what you elevated to leadership was, at least in part, that these automated systems were not catching the vast majority of this unwanted content out there.
[00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:19.323]  I mean, the sexual advances of this pedophile material, it simply doesn't begin to capture.
[00:20:19.323 --> 00:20:24.046]  Yet, Facebook didn't shift more resources, didn't change their process.
[00:20:24.046 --> 00:20:27.908]  And here's the thing that really gets me, and I'll end with this, Mr. Chairman, and I know there's others who want to question.
[00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:35.072]  I've been reading over and over and over again this case filed by my home state, Missouri v. Biden.
[00:20:35.072 --> 00:20:43.216]  Landmark First Amendment case, in which two federal courts, federal district court and a federal court of appeals, have found that Facebook, among others,
[00:20:44.247 --> 00:20:49.831]  Actively coordinated with the President Administration to censor First Amendment protected speech.
[00:20:49.831 --> 00:20:54.975]  Not this garbage that is not protected by anything in our Constitution, but First Amendment protected speech.
[00:20:54.975 --> 00:20:56.316]  Here's what gets me.
[00:20:56.316 --> 00:20:59.699]  What the courts found, this is in the record, this is factual findings.
[00:21:00.439 --> 00:21:09.183]  Is that Facebook devoted all kinds of resources and people, actual human people, to doing things like monitoring posts on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy.
[00:21:09.183 --> 00:21:15.186]  There's one example of a parent in my home state of Missouri who wanted to post something about a school board meeting.
[00:21:15.186 --> 00:21:19.248]  Facebook used human moderators to go and take down that post.
[00:21:19.248 --> 00:21:20.468]  That was important.
[00:21:20.468 --> 00:21:21.569]  That has to come down.
[00:21:21.569 --> 00:21:25.210]  We can't have them posting about school board meetings for heaven's sake.
[00:21:25.210 --> 00:21:27.932]  But the things that your daughter experienced, this
[00:21:28.712 --> 00:21:29.392]  Bingo!
[00:21:29.392 --> 00:21:29.693]  Bingo!
[00:21:29.693 --> 00:21:31.253]  You win the blue ribbon!
[00:21:31.253 --> 00:21:33.535]  AI is an excuse to take humans out of the decision-making process
[00:21:58.661 --> 00:22:06.865]  So they have robots that go out and kill innocent people and then erase their memory so there's no record.
[00:22:06.865 --> 00:22:21.131]  They don't want humans in the command chain and so as the report shows, I've got it right here, pedophilic encounters went up several thousand percent once AI took over because it's not programmed to stop it.
[00:22:21.131 --> 00:22:21.811]  Look at Target.
[00:22:22.609 --> 00:22:25.591]  Look at the ads everywhere with big media.
[00:22:25.591 --> 00:22:27.252]  It's pedophilic everywhere.
[00:22:27.252 --> 00:22:29.413]  This is what they want.
[00:22:29.413 --> 00:22:32.075]  They go, oh, AI is taking care of it, Congress.
[00:22:32.075 --> 00:22:40.780]  But if you go back to the articles, when Owen Schroeder got banned off Twitter three years ago, three and a half years ago, in the middle of the pandemic,
[00:22:41.482 --> 00:22:43.623]  They said, Infowars host has now been banned.
[00:22:43.623 --> 00:22:50.888]  Media Matters reported him for organizing a rally with Alex Jones against the lockdowns at the Capitol.
[00:22:50.888 --> 00:22:52.829]  Those evil Texans.
[00:22:52.829 --> 00:22:55.891]  Those evil Americans, even worse.
[00:22:55.891 --> 00:23:09.239]  They went down and organized a rally and everybody, including my dad, who never even posts stuff online, he went and made posts and said, let's go rally against this and he got banned.
[00:23:09.239 --> 00:23:10.460]  Banned, not just censored.
[00:23:11.815 --> 00:23:25.618]  Owen Schroyer, take it off Twitter, because we were going to go protest lockdowns and say it was a fraud, but then illegal aliens coming across, they're exempt from the shots, and Black Lives Matter burning down half the country in the summer of 2000, remember?
[00:23:25.618 --> 00:23:26.678]  They were exempt.
[00:23:26.678 --> 00:23:35.460]  They said, oh, studies show Black Lives Matter marches lower COVID, but everyone out being everywhere actually raises it.
[00:23:39.639 --> 00:23:44.664]  And the truth is, with herd immunity, it did actually lower it to have people out mixing with each other.
[00:23:44.664 --> 00:23:49.509]  So, so, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, you can see what they're doing.
[00:23:49.509 --> 00:23:52.231]  It's all about silencing you.
[00:23:52.231 --> 00:23:54.834]  And I have stacks of examples here that we're going to get to tonight.
[00:23:57.362 --> 00:24:01.265]  of the censorship and the control, and it's only getting worse.
[00:24:01.265 --> 00:24:08.951]  They don't just steal elections at the ballot box, or the electronic system, or with the names of dead people filled in and dropped in drop boxes.
[00:24:08.951 --> 00:24:11.533]  That's when they've got to see the final numbers at midnight.
[00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:12.874]  You saw it in six states.
[00:24:12.874 --> 00:24:16.056]  And then, you know, bring in the extra trucks and bloop!
[00:24:16.056 --> 00:24:16.857]  You'll get above it.
[00:24:16.857 --> 00:24:18.017]  They've got to have a target.
[00:24:18.017 --> 00:24:19.098]  Okay, we need 50,000 votes.
[00:24:19.098 --> 00:24:20.019]  Bloop!
[00:24:20.019 --> 00:24:20.880]  We need 10,000 votes.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:21.980]  Bloop!
[00:24:21.980 --> 00:24:23.361]  You see that perfect line.
[00:24:23.361 --> 00:24:25.023]  Because a normal voting line is like an arc.
[00:24:25.956 --> 00:24:26.536]  It's smooth.
[00:24:26.536 --> 00:24:27.996]  It's organic.
[00:24:27.996 --> 00:24:28.597]  Here's Trump.
[00:24:28.597 --> 00:24:30.017]  He's above the Democrats.
[00:24:30.017 --> 00:24:30.377]  Oh!
[00:24:30.377 --> 00:24:31.277]  Polls close.
[00:24:31.277 --> 00:24:32.077]  Midnight.
[00:24:32.077 --> 00:24:33.058]  Polling station closed.
[00:24:33.058 --> 00:24:34.438]  They block out the windows.
[00:24:34.438 --> 00:24:35.498]  Bunch of trucks pull in.
[00:24:35.498 --> 00:24:35.978]  Whoop!
[00:24:35.978 --> 00:24:40.939]  Biden wins.
[00:24:40.939 --> 00:24:41.679]  In Michigan.
[00:24:41.679 --> 00:24:42.680]  In Georgia.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.140]  And now it's all come out, actually.
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:51.042]  They say, oh, all these judges, when Trump challenged the election in November and December, they all said no evidence.
[00:24:51.042 --> 00:24:52.842]  They wouldn't hear the evidence.
[00:24:54.684 --> 00:24:59.627]  They said it's not our jurisdiction, it's the legislature or it's Congress, which was true.
[00:24:59.627 --> 00:25:10.495]  So we went to the Capitol for a 10-day investigation and a protest to show our numbers and the feds hijacked it and attacked the Capitol and you know the rest of the story.
[00:25:10.495 --> 00:25:17.620]  And now Trump's been indicted for questioning the election.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:23.484]  Trump shows up at football games and the roar is so loud.
[00:25:23.484 --> 00:25:24.325]  Got clips of that coming up.
[00:25:26.764 --> 00:25:27.725]  The clip's like five minutes long.
[00:25:27.725 --> 00:25:28.385]  We won't play the whole clip.
[00:25:28.385 --> 00:25:29.526]  When we come back, we'll play part of it.
[00:25:29.526 --> 00:25:32.727]  Just roaring 360, 100,000 people.
[00:25:32.727 --> 00:25:34.908]  Just roaring.
[00:25:34.908 --> 00:25:39.491]  Biden couldn't get 10 people to his rallies.
[00:25:39.491 --> 00:25:43.433]  But we're told he won with 9 million votes more than Barack Obama.
[00:25:43.433 --> 00:25:46.014]  I never said Barack Obama stole the election.
[00:25:46.014 --> 00:25:47.595]  He fooled America.
[00:25:47.595 --> 00:25:49.315]  People wanted to end racism.
[00:25:49.315 --> 00:25:51.056]  White people went and got him elected.
[00:25:51.056 --> 00:25:52.177]  He won both times.
[00:25:57.079 --> 00:26:00.000]  Hillary Clinton lost fair and square despite massive fraud.
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.781]  Trump just landslid her ass.
[00:26:04.781 --> 00:26:10.363]  But Joe Biden lost by probably 20 million votes, folks.
[00:26:10.363 --> 00:26:11.903]  But here's their problem.
[00:26:11.903 --> 00:26:13.604]  I've talked to so many experts, which I hadn't spent.
[00:26:14.448 --> 00:26:20.252]  They only got so many dead people and so many people moved out of the district, who they're going to ride in those mail-in ballots.
[00:26:20.252 --> 00:26:22.253]  They only got so much ammo.
[00:26:22.253 --> 00:26:26.656]  And they almost stole Texas and almost stole Florida in 2020 and 2022.
[00:26:26.656 --> 00:26:32.781]  But you see the Democrats going up like this, and the Republicans are right above them.
[00:26:32.781 --> 00:26:34.362]  And all of a sudden, you see them put everything in.
[00:26:34.362 --> 00:26:35.362]  Bloop!
[00:26:35.362 --> 00:26:37.884]  But it isn't enough, and they run out.
[00:26:37.884 --> 00:26:40.106]  So the curve's flat, and then it goes parabolic.
[00:26:40.106 --> 00:26:40.346]  Bloop!
[00:26:42.082 --> 00:26:43.223]  They throw everything and we got down.
[00:26:43.223 --> 00:26:43.943]  Bloop!
[00:26:43.943 --> 00:26:44.984]  Didn't make it.
[00:26:44.984 --> 00:26:45.584]  Barely.
[00:26:45.584 --> 00:26:50.307]  And who believes Florida went Democrat?
[00:26:50.307 --> 00:26:51.027]  Almost did.
[00:26:51.027 --> 00:26:52.648]  Who believes Texas came?
[00:26:52.648 --> 00:26:56.070]  Who believes Ted Cruz won by 40-something thousand votes or whatever it was?
[00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:57.911]  Does anybody in their right mind believe?
[00:26:57.911 --> 00:26:58.211]  No.
[00:26:58.211 --> 00:27:00.052]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:27:00.052 --> 00:27:02.653]  Beto O'Rourke.
[00:27:02.653 --> 00:27:03.994]  Almost beat Ted Cruz.
[00:27:03.994 --> 00:27:08.296]  Holy Toledo.
[00:27:08.296 --> 00:27:10.738]  That is the biggest load of horse manure I've ever heard.
[00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:15.714]  So we got a bunch of examples of that.
[00:27:15.714 --> 00:27:17.314]  I say so much here.
[00:27:17.314 --> 00:27:20.535]  What did I say I was going to play when we come back from break?
[00:27:20.535 --> 00:27:20.975]  Trump!
[00:27:20.975 --> 00:27:22.555]  Yeah, Trump with the big crowds.
[00:27:22.555 --> 00:27:28.917]  And then I'm going to shift gears to the election fraud news coming out, and then I'm going to move on to the big enchilada.
[00:27:28.917 --> 00:27:38.079]  The big developments in Israel and in Ukraine, they are big, as in capital B, capital I, capital G, with eight exclamation points at the end of it.
[00:27:39.005 --> 00:27:43.127]  Please remember that the world is in a battle for the future.
[00:27:43.127 --> 00:27:44.008]  Good versus evil.
[00:27:44.008 --> 00:27:50.051]  It's right out in the open, and I'm very honored and blessed that the enemy sees us as very effective because we are because of you.
[00:27:50.051 --> 00:27:57.034]  When you share links, when you take clips out and share them, when you do all the great things you're doing, when you pray for the broadcast, when you buy products at InfoWarshaw.com, it changes the world.

[00:28:49.667 --> 00:28:50.468]  Oh my gosh.
[00:28:50.468 --> 00:28:51.088]  I've been plugging.
[00:28:51.088 --> 00:28:52.769]  I haven't even told you.
[00:28:52.769 --> 00:28:54.829]  We have store-wide free shipping and double Patreon points.
[00:28:54.829 --> 00:28:56.830]  Black Friday comes early, but it's going to end this week.
[00:28:59.719 --> 00:29:05.923]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[00:29:05.923 --> 00:29:10.606]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners and because it's so hard to produce.
[00:29:10.606 --> 00:29:14.988]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[00:29:16.409 --> 00:29:19.473]  So many people have serious issues.
[00:29:19.473 --> 00:29:21.035]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[00:29:21.035 --> 00:29:26.982]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[00:29:26.982 --> 00:29:33.009]  Most other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[00:29:33.009 --> 00:29:35.792]  But this is pure atomic certified
[00:29:37.674 --> 00:29:37.974]  I don't
[00:29:54.031 --> 00:30:00.554]  Bodies is back!

[00:30:07.957 --> 00:30:13.339]  Utilized for thousands of years, tumeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.

[00:30:32.195 --> 00:30:43.967]  Regular tumeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extractees and bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in tumeric.

[00:32:12.499 --> 00:32:14.923]  They're turning the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:32:14.923 --> 00:32:16.925]  I'll eat your ass!
[00:32:16.925 --> 00:32:19.729]  You Nazi scum!
[00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:23.834]  Let's free the Patriots and defeat the globalist techies.
[00:32:23.834 --> 00:32:26.578]  We are going to defeat the globalists.
[00:32:26.578 --> 00:32:28.380]  Very bigly.
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.123]  This game is mostly peaceful.
[00:32:38.568 --> 00:32:42.311]  I'm going to lower the world's population.
[00:32:42.311 --> 00:32:45.074]  Oh, Big Bill, I'm taking you down, rapist.
[00:32:45.074 --> 00:32:49.137]  I did not have sexual relations with that saxophone.

[00:33:12.923 --> 00:33:14.624]  Big Brother.
[00:33:14.624 --> 00:33:16.965]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:16.965 --> 00:33:18.746]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:18.746 --> 00:33:20.807]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:33:20.807 --> 00:33:22.968]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:22.968 --> 00:33:27.650]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:31.581 --> 00:33:49.052]  Before I plunge back into all the huge world events, I want to just make a note here to all the listeners that are kind enough and care enough and are informed enough and engaged enough to tune in that I was going to do this tonight, but two hours is not enough.
[00:33:49.052 --> 00:33:54.116]  So tomorrow I've got a bunch of big guests on, whistleblowers, insiders, you name it.
[00:33:54.116 --> 00:33:57.438]  And I keep saying the biggest COVID developments just came out because they just keep getting bigger.
[00:33:58.912 --> 00:34:04.743]  Absolute government documents from DARPA are now public, released by Congress just last week, that the U.S.
[00:34:04.743 --> 00:34:08.230]  government created COVID-19 years ago, years before they released it.
[00:34:09.594 --> 00:34:14.676]  And that it is a sterilant and it does cause cancer and it does turn off your immune system.
[00:34:14.676 --> 00:34:18.178]  I mean just unbelievable information.
[00:34:18.178 --> 00:34:25.481]  I mean I'm like pinching myself that I'm in a real universe on air talking about this and it's like this weird thing.
[00:34:25.481 --> 00:34:36.705]  They're committing these giant insane mass murder crimes that make Hitler blush and Mao Zedong blush and Stalin blush and Lenin blush and Pol Pot blush
[00:34:38.374 --> 00:34:42.518]  And Nero blush.
[00:34:42.518 --> 00:34:46.361]  And Ramesses I blush.
[00:34:46.361 --> 00:34:49.263]  And Herod blush.
[00:34:49.263 --> 00:34:52.086]  And Pol Pot blush.
[00:34:52.086 --> 00:34:54.147]  And Fidel Castro blush.
[00:34:54.147 --> 00:34:55.348]  And Genghis Khan blush.
[00:34:55.348 --> 00:34:59.312]  And Attila the Hun blush.
[00:34:59.312 --> 00:35:01.914]  And I've been the terrible blush.
[00:35:01.914 --> 00:35:03.435]  And it's really going on.
[00:35:03.435 --> 00:35:05.117]  It's in Lancet medical journals.
[00:35:05.117 --> 00:35:05.197]  It's...
[00:35:07.557 --> 00:35:15.200]  I've done a lot of research on this, and so we'll be talking about it tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:21.122]  Central Time, right after Harrison Smith does American Journal, 8 a.m.
[00:35:21.122 --> 00:35:29.645]  Central, and right before Owen does The War of, oh, I'm sorry, he's in prison, the judge said forced speech in the sentencing document, I'm sorry.
[00:35:29.645 --> 00:35:36.228]  We're in such a free cut, I mean, the hour is late, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
[00:35:38.325 --> 00:35:47.931]  All right, so before I hit the military and world news, it's really big, let's cover some domestic news first.
[00:35:47.931 --> 00:35:50.412]  Three stacks on that.
[00:35:50.412 --> 00:35:57.776]  And let's first just go to a clip of Trump at a major football game.
[00:35:57.776 --> 00:36:00.978]  It's the Palmettos Stadium, and here is 100,000 people cheering.
[00:36:30.027 --> 00:36:31.368]  And it just goes on and on.
[00:36:31.368 --> 00:36:35.991]  So there's Trump with 100,000 people, a packed college football stadium.
[00:36:35.991 --> 00:36:39.774]  Real president.
[00:36:39.774 --> 00:36:46.299]  And we're told he's... I mean, where's the booze?
[00:36:46.299 --> 00:36:49.102]  No, it's just roaring applause.
[00:36:49.102 --> 00:36:50.563]  It goes on and on.
[00:36:50.563 --> 00:36:51.944]  So let's shift gears out of that now.
[00:36:53.666 --> 00:36:57.369]  This is in local Georgia news, but they're barely reporting it.
[00:36:57.369 --> 00:36:58.470]  You would think it would be bigger.
[00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:00.872]  Jack Posobiec talked about it.
[00:37:00.872 --> 00:37:01.913]  Jack Posobiec on Twitter.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:07.243]  Breaking news, a federal judge appointed by Obama just ruled against voting machines in Georgia.
[00:37:07.243 --> 00:37:14.027]  The machine's cybersecurity flaws violate the constitutional rights of voters and are not a legitimate voting machine system.
[00:37:14.027 --> 00:37:15.148]  Here's Newsweek.
[00:37:15.148 --> 00:37:15.368]  U.S.
[00:37:15.368 --> 00:37:27.936]  District Judge Amy Totenberg issued a 135-page ruling Friday in a long-running lawsuit to seek to get rid of Georgia's electronic voting machines in favor of hand-marked paper ballots that just
[00:37:28.636 --> 00:37:29.837]  I've got a big stack of news on that.
[00:37:29.837 --> 00:37:30.977]  But here's what I'm getting at.
[00:37:57.222 --> 00:38:02.624]  A lot of people call in, and I get emails on the street, why should we vote?
[00:38:02.624 --> 00:38:06.946]  It doesn't matter.
[00:38:06.946 --> 00:38:12.028]  They're doing everything they can to move things away from voting and government to unelected corporate bureaucracies.
[00:38:12.028 --> 00:38:17.611]  And they're doing everything they can to bring in illegal aliens and other people to then vote and displace you.
[00:38:17.611 --> 00:38:20.552]  Yeah, there's fraud, and just because
[00:38:22.449 --> 00:38:25.751]  If somebody comes up and attacks you with a crowbar, it doesn't mean you roll over and die.
[00:38:25.751 --> 00:38:30.194]  You're going to have to move out of the way, grab the crowbar away, and, you know, do what you got to do.
[00:38:30.194 --> 00:38:33.677]  Just because you're going uphill doesn't mean you just roll over and die.
[00:38:33.677 --> 00:38:51.630]  By engaging these elections, by the lawsuits, and the research, and the poll watching, and the films by Dinesh D'Souza, and everything else, we're kicking their ass, and people realize there's a fraud, so more folks that are on the fence are going to voting to make sure there's such a landslide, they lose!
[00:38:53.646 --> 00:38:54.906]  It would take hours to describe it.
[00:38:54.906 --> 00:39:03.410]  I've had top experts on, members of the top scientists, computer scientists have been interviewed by Congress, you name it.
[00:39:03.410 --> 00:39:15.254]  It's almost impossible to steal an election, local or federal, off-year or main cycle, if
[00:39:16.783 --> 00:39:19.425]  You're in a general election or an off year, it doesn't matter.
[00:39:19.425 --> 00:39:23.568]  If you got 10%, that's really hard to beat.
[00:39:23.568 --> 00:39:33.375]  I mean, if you did everything you could and just, if Facebook threw $500 million at a handful of states, they could still probably do it, like they just did in 2000.
[00:39:33.375 --> 00:39:35.096]  But barely.
[00:39:35.096 --> 00:39:38.999]  You get a 15-point lead, you cannot fix it.
[00:39:38.999 --> 00:39:42.301]  Because you still gotta use real names in the database.
[00:39:42.301 --> 00:39:44.603]  You just, no amount of people can be sent to,
[00:39:46.027 --> 00:39:55.191]  The centers, the safe houses where they give them hundreds of ballots apiece, they fill in the names of dead people or folks that moved out of district, you just can't do it.
[00:39:55.191 --> 00:40:01.574]  And Trump's 20 points ahead of Biden in most polls, 15 in others.
[00:40:01.574 --> 00:40:03.795]  He's 70% of the field against the other Republicans.
[00:40:07.671 --> 00:40:14.614]  That's why they're now talking about killing him and saying he's got to be liquidated, he's got to be eliminated all over TV.
[00:40:14.614 --> 00:40:17.676]  I played the clips last week, I'm not going to play them again.
[00:40:17.676 --> 00:40:18.176]  Don't believe me?
[00:40:18.176 --> 00:40:22.098]  You're a new viewer, new listener, just type in President Trump eliminated.
[00:40:22.098 --> 00:40:23.739]  President Trump removed.
[00:40:23.739 --> 00:40:25.119]  President Trump assassinated.
[00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:26.020]  You'll get the videos.
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:36.665]  That's the new, you know, a month ago it was he was Hitler and he's going to put everybody in death camps and then now it's that he is going to die.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:46.442]  So Joe Biden goes and talks to a crowd of like 15 people, that's his big campaign event, and then Trump's got 100,000 all cheering him.
[00:40:46.442 --> 00:40:48.223]  I mean, come on, people!
[00:40:48.223 --> 00:40:51.384]  Do you think Joe Biden got 9 million more votes than Obama?
[00:40:51.384 --> 00:40:55.785]  The answer is no, he didn't.
[00:40:55.785 --> 00:40:58.526]  If he was a car, he'd be like 1 horsepower.
[00:40:58.526 --> 00:41:00.927]  Trump's like 5,000 horsepower.
[00:41:00.927 --> 00:41:02.768]  It is a joke.
[00:41:02.768 --> 00:41:03.468]  A joke on us.
[00:41:04.781 --> 00:41:07.324]  So I see these articles every day.
[00:41:07.324 --> 00:41:08.425]  They only hit local news.
[00:41:08.425 --> 00:41:09.427]  They never hit national news.
[00:41:09.427 --> 00:41:17.896]  But they've caught Democrats, Democrats have, stealing elections in Connecticut this year twice.
[00:41:17.896 --> 00:41:22.362]  They've caught them in Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Florida.
[00:41:24.030 --> 00:41:24.511]  Everywhere!
[00:41:24.511 --> 00:41:26.352]  I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[00:41:26.352 --> 00:41:28.234]  Here's some of the headlines just today.
[00:41:28.234 --> 00:41:34.399]  Iowa County Supervisor's Wife Convicted of 52 Counts of Voter Fraud, Filling Out Fake Names and Fake Ballots.
[00:41:34.399 --> 00:41:37.722]  I mean, the ballots are real, but fake names on them.
[00:41:37.722 --> 00:41:39.423]  Now here's the censorship.
[00:41:39.423 --> 00:41:41.705]  This is another form of voter suppression.
[00:41:41.705 --> 00:41:52.354]  Air Force Base purportedly tells members to steer clear of conservative events, warning participation with such groups could jeopardize, this is a quote,
[00:41:53.735 --> 00:41:56.476]  to jeopardize their continued service in the U.S.
[00:41:56.476 --> 00:41:57.296]  military.
[00:41:57.296 --> 00:42:06.220]  Well, when the Air Force got asked about that last Tuesday, they responded Friday with this.
[00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:16.224]  Air Force Base walks back statement encouraging soldiers not to attend a conservative rally, but then the Air Force itself put out a statement saying they back it.
[00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:29.115]  But the point is they're literally telling conservatives, the military, that's the majority, you can't go to a rally or you might get court-martialed or a dishonorable discharge.
[00:42:29.115 --> 00:42:29.635]  We're going to break.
[00:42:29.635 --> 00:42:32.076]  I'm going to come back with the rest of this.
[00:42:32.076 --> 00:42:34.937]  And then this headline I just kind of mentioned, but here it is.
[00:42:34.937 --> 00:42:36.038]  It's Business Insider.
[00:42:36.038 --> 00:42:37.078]  They've all been running these headlines.
[00:42:37.078 --> 00:42:39.579]  But this one's new, so I'll cover this one.
[00:42:39.579 --> 00:42:42.221]  There's so many, I can't recap the others.
[00:42:42.221 --> 00:42:44.682]  Media wonders, what happens if Trump dies?
[00:42:46.127 --> 00:42:47.550]  Before the election.
[00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:50.395]  I mean, you talk about pre-programming, folks.
[00:42:50.395 --> 00:42:51.958]  You talk about predictive programming.
[00:42:51.958 --> 00:42:53.380]  This is it.
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.985]  Then we'll look at what's happening in elections worldwide.
[00:42:55.985 --> 00:42:57.809]  Then we'll look at Ukraine and Russia and so much more.
[00:43:00.549 --> 00:43:03.691]  Thanksgiving 2023 is here.
[00:43:03.691 --> 00:43:09.135]  And I'm giving Thanksgiving for all we've done against tyranny and your incredible support together in this fight.
[00:43:09.135 --> 00:43:21.043]  And I'm particularly giving Thanksgiving that X2, our number one product, the only true atomic iodine on the market after a year plus of being sold out, is finally back in stock, ready to ship now.
[00:43:21.043 --> 00:43:25.646]  If you don't know the power of X2 and the iodine conspiracy, you are insane.
[00:43:25.646 --> 00:43:26.767]  Get X2 now.
[00:43:26.767 --> 00:43:27.847]  It could be the last run ever.
[00:43:27.847 --> 00:43:29.028]  We get shut down.
[00:43:29.028 --> 00:43:29.889]  While you still can,
[00:43:30.909 --> 00:43:38.873]  At InfoWarsTore.com, research iodine deficiency and billions of people with cognitive disabilities because they don't have it.
[00:43:38.873 --> 00:43:44.416]  X2, X2, X2 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:43:44.416 --> 00:43:47.598]  It takes a few weeks to kick in, but it is the building block to everything.
[00:43:47.598 --> 00:43:48.318]  It's the missing link.
[00:43:48.318 --> 00:43:52.840]  They bomb us with the fluoride that is in the same family, but has the opposite effect.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.542]  This is the holy grail of supplements and empowering yourself.
[00:43:56.542 --> 00:43:58.263]  X2, back in stock right now.

[00:44:05.211 --> 00:44:15.044]  The globalists are bombarding us with toxic chemicals hitting us in the air, the water, the food, the 5G, the poison shots, the shedding.
[00:44:16.486 --> 00:44:18.047]  I think so.

[00:46:00.330 --> 00:46:08.500]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:13.986]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it.
[00:46:13.986 --> 00:46:18.932]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega-3s.
[00:46:20.293 --> 00:46:25.136]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[00:46:25.136 --> 00:46:30.779]  Your best option is our Ultimate Fish Oil and Ultimate Krill Oil at InfowarsStore.com.

[00:47:01.112 --> 00:47:14.942]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:14.942 --> 00:47:18.944]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:47:18.944 --> 00:47:26.830]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:42.408 --> 00:47:45.709]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:45.709 --> 00:47:49.651]  I want to finish up with what's happening domestically with Trump.
[00:47:49.651 --> 00:47:55.733]  Then I want to get into internationally how we are making major headway, getting patriots and anti-globals elected everywhere.
[00:47:55.733 --> 00:47:58.514]  Really huge news on that front.
[00:47:58.514 --> 00:48:05.676]  And then, when I start the next hour, Kiev's top MP, who is the head of Zelensky's party, he's banned every other party,
[00:48:07.276 --> 00:48:10.897]  Shane, Ukraine conflict could have ended in spring, but Zelensky said no.
[00:48:10.897 --> 00:48:12.877]  So they're getting ready to cut him loose.
[00:48:12.877 --> 00:48:17.458]  Also, Haaretz, one of the biggest Israeli newspapers, is reporting what we already knew.
[00:48:17.458 --> 00:48:21.019]  The government stood down and allowed the attacks to take place.
[00:48:21.019 --> 00:48:23.739]  They knew what was going to happen, and they did it.
[00:48:23.739 --> 00:48:34.001]  Now, we don't know exactly who's behind that, and it's not anti-Israel to sit there and say there's some evil people in control that allowed that to happen.
[00:48:34.001 --> 00:48:36.842]  And now they want to ship the Islamists over here.
[00:48:38.066 --> 00:48:41.288]  So we're going to be talking about that coming up.
[00:48:41.288 --> 00:48:46.090]  Because when they let the Islamists in and they attack, you know who loses their rights?
[00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:48.992]  The people of America.
[00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:50.292]  Why are they murdering common sense?
[00:48:50.292 --> 00:48:54.835]  Why does the TSA grab your genitals and put you through body scanners while the border's wide open?
[00:48:54.835 --> 00:48:56.575]  It's all about taking your rights away.
[00:48:56.575 --> 00:49:01.478]  But getting back to domestic politics.
[00:49:01.478 --> 00:49:04.439]  Their indictments have failed.
[00:49:04.439 --> 00:49:05.560]  In fact, I'll talk over it.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:06.240]  Roll it with audio.
[00:49:08.894 --> 00:49:14.638]  Football game at the Palmetto Bowl in the Carolinas.
[00:49:14.638 --> 00:49:15.879]  And he's getting a standing ovation.
[00:49:15.879 --> 00:49:21.224]  It goes on and on and on and on and on.
[00:49:21.224 --> 00:49:28.969]  This is a guy indicted four times, a bunch of civil lawsuits.
[00:49:28.969 --> 00:49:32.993]  And is it making the local officials not want to be with him?
[00:49:32.993 --> 00:49:33.833]  Is it making the crowd?
[00:49:33.833 --> 00:49:34.814]  No, no.
[00:49:34.814 --> 00:49:35.635]  He goes to the UFC.
[00:49:35.635 --> 00:49:35.955]  It's like,
[00:49:37.822 --> 00:49:40.664]  A Roman emperor has arrived.
[00:49:40.664 --> 00:49:49.129]  So to quote Tucker Carlson, if they indict Trump a few more times, people will probably try to vote him to be king, which I don't want.
[00:49:49.129 --> 00:49:52.171]  So, they're in their own bubble in D.C.
[00:49:52.171 --> 00:49:53.632]  and New York, these lawyers.
[00:49:53.632 --> 00:49:54.833]  It's all a bunch of lawyers.
[00:49:54.833 --> 00:49:56.874]  Never worked a day in their life.
[00:49:56.874 --> 00:50:00.837]  They just walk around glad-handing each other all day.
[00:50:00.837 --> 00:50:04.379]  And they don't get the world's turned against them and America's turned against them.
[00:50:06.121 --> 00:50:10.783]  And the public's turned against the wars.
[00:50:10.783 --> 00:50:21.106]  Trump receives heroes welcome at Palmetto Bowl in South Carolina.
[00:50:21.106 --> 00:50:28.289]  So, the talking point the last month is Trump is Hitler.
[00:50:28.289 --> 00:50:31.830]  But the new talking point is, oh, he's going to die next year.
[00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:37.555]  And it's all over CNN, MSNBC, ABC.
[00:50:37.555 --> 00:50:38.456]  I've got all the articles.
[00:50:38.456 --> 00:50:45.925]  The new talking point is, well, he's going to die of a heart attack, which means they're going with poisoning or a stroke.
[00:50:45.925 --> 00:50:47.226]  But Trump's already wily.
[00:50:47.226 --> 00:50:52.452]  He sends his aides randomly to buy hundreds of bags of food three times a day.
[00:50:52.452 --> 00:50:53.654]  Won't eat the food anywhere.
[00:50:55.017 --> 00:51:02.522]  Or he'll randomly walk up at Mar-a-Lago that has a whole bunch of kitchens, five or six of them, and he's had employees for years.
[00:51:02.522 --> 00:51:04.283]  He'll say, let me see the steaks.
[00:51:04.283 --> 00:51:05.424]  They'll pull out a big platter of steaks.
[00:51:05.424 --> 00:51:07.566]  He'll say, I'll take that one right there.
[00:51:07.566 --> 00:51:14.110]  And he watches them cook it.
[00:51:14.110 --> 00:51:17.412]  Trump's in a video game for his life, but it's a real video game.
[00:51:17.412 --> 00:51:18.213]  Can you imagine that game?
[00:51:19.946 --> 00:51:21.968]  Not where little things are shooting bullets at you.
[00:51:21.968 --> 00:51:26.293]  You literally gotta like say, go get me a hundred hamburgers right now.
[00:51:26.293 --> 00:51:33.020]  He'll bring them in and he'll randomly pick one bag and start eating that.
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.565]  Media wonders what happens if Trump dies in 2024.
[00:51:37.565 --> 00:51:41.549]  Here's what happens if Donald Trump dies while running for 2024 presidential election.
[00:51:41.549 --> 00:51:42.309]  Business Insider.
[00:51:43.208 --> 00:51:52.459]  Left wing publication Business Insider published a bizarre article asking what would happen if former President Donald Trump died before the 2024 election.
[00:51:52.459 --> 00:51:57.165]  So they are really getting desperate.
[00:51:57.165 --> 00:51:58.707]  Let's play this Mitt Romney clip.
[00:51:58.707 --> 00:52:00.329]  This guy is such a joke.
[00:52:02.409 --> 00:52:04.950]  He's such a talking point machine.
[00:52:04.950 --> 00:52:10.093]  As soon as the deep state turned against Biden, he loved Biden until a month ago.
[00:52:10.093 --> 00:52:14.455]  Now he's like, Biden's got to go too, because they want him to step down.
[00:52:14.455 --> 00:52:20.938]  And he'll vote for anybody, Democrat or Republican, if it's not Vivek Ramaswamy or Trump.
[00:52:20.938 --> 00:52:23.619]  Now, if you didn't think Ramaswamy was real, now you know he is.
[00:52:24.821 --> 00:52:31.184]  Because Mitt Romney goes on, quote, national TV that has a few million viewers now.
[00:52:31.184 --> 00:52:32.305]  Almost no one's watching it.
[00:52:32.305 --> 00:52:34.906]  Used to have tens of millions.
[00:52:34.906 --> 00:52:41.969]  And they prop up this loser, this joke, I'd rather vote Democrat than for Trump or Vivek.
[00:52:41.969 --> 00:52:43.470]  Here he is.
[00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:45.431]  Who do you like in the Republican field?
[00:52:46.328 --> 00:52:48.149]  Anybody.
[00:52:48.149 --> 00:52:52.011]  I'd be happy to support virtually any one of the Republicans.
[00:52:52.011 --> 00:52:58.173]  Maybe not Vivek, but the others that are running would be acceptable to me and I'd be happy to vote for them.
[00:52:58.173 --> 00:53:00.454]  I'd be happy to vote for a number of the Democrats too.
[00:53:00.454 --> 00:53:08.377]  It would be an upgrade, in my opinion, from Donald Trump and perhaps also from Joe Biden.
[00:53:08.377 --> 00:53:09.838]  Look, I like President Biden.
[00:53:10.758 --> 00:53:14.081]  You know, I find him a very charming, engaging person.
[00:53:14.081 --> 00:53:18.225]  There's some places I agree with him, but most places I disagree with him.
[00:53:18.225 --> 00:53:24.950]  I think he's made all sorts of terrible mistakes, but I would like to see someone else run.
[00:53:24.950 --> 00:53:26.832]  Oh, he's a very charming pedophile.
[00:53:26.832 --> 00:53:30.435]  Very charming Chinese Communist agent.
[00:53:30.435 --> 00:53:32.737]  Mitt Romney is a snake.
[00:53:32.737 --> 00:53:34.719]  He's a joke.
[00:53:34.719 --> 00:53:37.241]  And everybody that's got half a brain knows that.
[00:53:40.071 --> 00:53:45.394]  But he's pretending to be propped up by corporate media, making the rounds.
[00:53:45.394 --> 00:53:49.136]  His book didn't do well, despite being on every corporate media channel.
[00:53:49.136 --> 00:53:50.317]  He's a dinosaur.
[00:53:50.317 --> 00:53:51.497]  He's a sellout.
[00:53:51.497 --> 00:53:58.782]  When you think of a traitor, when you think of a sack of garbage, when you think of somebody going to hell, you think Mitt Romney.
[00:53:58.782 --> 00:54:02.123]  I mean, literally.
[00:54:02.123 --> 00:54:04.205]  He's who you don't want to be.
[00:54:04.205 --> 00:54:07.226]  Pathetic.
[00:54:07.226 --> 00:54:08.207]  Absolute joker.
[00:54:11.107 --> 00:54:18.670]  But when you think of victory, think of Gert Wilders, who's been physically attacked more than 10 times, who's been exposing Islamic invasion.
[00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:25.853]  Conservative Freedom Party marks stunning victories in Dutch election.
[00:54:25.853 --> 00:54:27.634]  They are now going to be the majority party.
[00:54:27.634 --> 00:54:30.075]  They're forming a government.
[00:54:30.075 --> 00:54:33.036]  And he'll be the leader of the Netherlands.
[00:54:35.068 --> 00:54:41.711]  In one week, Argentina goes to an anti-globalist, and the Netherlands goes to an anti-globalist.
[00:54:41.711 --> 00:54:44.653]  If I play the speeches, he sounds like me.
[00:54:44.653 --> 00:54:45.913]  But he's not copying me.
[00:54:45.913 --> 00:54:47.674]  He sees the same enemy.
[00:54:47.674 --> 00:54:50.275]  I got Viktor Orban.
[00:54:50.275 --> 00:54:54.297]  His party's now 60% of the parliament.
[00:54:54.297 --> 00:54:56.078]  You know what that means?
[00:54:56.078 --> 00:54:59.219]  You can be 30% like Trudeau and stay in power because you make deals.
[00:54:59.219 --> 00:55:00.780]  No.
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.361]  60% of the parliament is beyond a supermajority.
[00:55:04.989 --> 00:55:06.810]  It's a gigantic majority.
[00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:09.272]  It is a mandate.
[00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:11.814]  It is a landslide.
[00:55:11.814 --> 00:55:13.335]  It is powerful.
[00:55:13.335 --> 00:55:17.778]  Look at this Victor Orban quote from the longer speech that's on Infowars.com.
[00:55:17.778 --> 00:55:20.820]  Brussels model for Europe leads to chaos.
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:24.603]  We don't want to be hashtag Soros debt slaves.
[00:55:24.603 --> 00:55:30.707]  We don't want to live in a zone of gang wars and we don't want to live in a world of migrant ghettos.
[00:55:30.707 --> 00:55:34.430]  It's time for a change in Brussels, meaning the EU world government.
[00:55:36.209 --> 00:55:44.494]  That's just the first sentence of the video I've got right here that's on Infowars.com.
[00:55:44.494 --> 00:55:46.875]  Wow!
[00:55:46.875 --> 00:55:58.801]  And patriots are taking over the Swedish government, the Italian government, the Spanish government.
[00:55:58.801 --> 00:56:01.723]  That's why they shot the deputy leader in the face last week.
[00:56:04.053 --> 00:56:09.958]  That's why they're going to the houses and trying to kill people, because that's all communists have got when they're losing.
[00:56:09.958 --> 00:56:12.760]  And they're not communists like you think.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:15.142]  It's like the CIA that put Mao Zedong into power in 1949.
[00:56:15.142 --> 00:56:20.486]  They want a communist they can deal with that will enslave the people.
[00:56:20.486 --> 00:56:27.632]  I got this big stack of news right here with Tony Blair and all of them announcing the world government, announcing the cashless society, announcing it all.
[00:56:27.632 --> 00:56:32.516]  But I'm going to get to that and these global government clips I have after.
[00:56:33.999 --> 00:56:37.600]  I get to the big enchilada.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:41.321]  And that's what's happening in Russia and happening in Ukraine.
[00:56:41.321 --> 00:56:45.722]  Now it's mainstream news that Ukraine has lost.
[00:56:45.722 --> 00:56:53.305]  So what happens now, and it's mainstream news, the world has rejected Israel and what just happened, as if they didn't know that was going to happen.
[00:56:53.305 --> 00:56:56.766]  It's a larger plan here to set us all up.
[00:56:56.766 --> 00:56:57.846]  We're going to cover it next hour.

[00:58:49.571 --> 00:58:53.617]  Why do you think the globalists are desperately trying to censor everybody?
[00:58:53.617 --> 00:58:57.182]  Why are they attacking myself and Donald Trump and Elon Musk and everybody else?
[00:58:57.182 --> 00:59:02.289]  Because they can't get through this giant megalomaniacal power grab if we're here exposing them.
[00:59:02.289 --> 00:59:04.732]  But we're not just exposing their operation.
[00:59:04.732 --> 00:59:05.454]  In my new book,
[00:59:05.974 --> 00:59:09.637]  We give you the solutions to build a new, better world.
[00:59:09.637 --> 00:59:13.320]  An alternative to Klaus Schwab's, You Will Eat the Bugs.
[00:59:13.320 --> 00:59:15.161]  This is The Great Awakening.
[00:59:15.161 --> 00:59:19.544]  The plan to defeat the globalists and launch the second great renaissance.
[00:59:19.544 --> 00:59:21.326]  It's a companion to my last book.
[00:59:21.326 --> 00:59:23.327]  It was a number one worldwide bestseller.
[00:59:23.327 --> 00:59:26.209]  And this book is even thicker and even more powerful.
[00:59:26.209 --> 00:59:27.951]  Get your copy of The Great Awakening.
[00:59:28.351 --> 00:59:31.973]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:06.317 --> 01:00:12.621]  Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared on March 8th, 2014.
[01:00:12.621 --> 01:00:21.908]  On May 19th, about nine weeks later, a leaked video was published to YouTube by a third party who claimed to have received it on March 12th.
[01:00:21.908 --> 01:00:28.712]  The video shows what appears to be a jet airliner on fire, being trailed by three spiraling orbs.
[01:00:28.712 --> 01:00:35.037]  Eventually, the three orbs change to a vertical pattern and disappear in a flash with the airliner.
[01:00:35.917 --> 01:00:40.058]  Leaving a dead-end trail of smoke in the sky.
[01:00:40.058 --> 01:00:49.220]  A month later on June 12th, a second video was published to the same channel that showed the exact same event taken from a different viewpoint.
[01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:54.862]  These videos have been deleted from YouTube but can still be found on archive.org.
[01:00:54.862 --> 01:01:03.744]  Ashton Forbes and his team have been researching these videos extensively and have provided exhaustive evidence that these videos are legitimate,
[01:01:04.224 --> 01:01:11.011]  Including digital forensics verified by CGI professionals, eyewitnesses, and government data.
[01:01:11.011 --> 01:01:18.360]  Forbes and his team have successfully addressed all debunker claims and have listed them for all to see on X.com.
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:20.462]  At Just X Ashton.
[01:01:20.462 --> 01:01:23.685]  So far, nobody has been able to debunk this research.
[01:01:24.486 --> 01:01:42.119]  Their research shows that the first leaked video was taken from a pair of American Signals Intelligence satellites known as USA-229, twin satellites capable of creating 3D stereoscopic images by capturing two slightly different views.
[01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:50.826]  The twin USA-229 satellites are logged at the exact location, time, and apparent angle required to have captured this video.
[01:01:51.526 --> 01:01:54.647]  This event occurred at around 2.30 in the morning.
[01:01:54.647 --> 01:01:56.228]  It was completely dark.
[01:01:56.228 --> 01:02:04.452]  The wavelengths captured by these cameras are for detail and the stereoscopic effect allows for added depth perception.
[01:02:04.452 --> 01:02:14.456]  The source of the second video has been identified as an MQ-1C Grey Eagle unmanned combat drone with infrared and thermal technology.
[01:02:14.456 --> 01:02:16.697]  This video focuses on the heat signature.
[01:02:17.728 --> 01:02:23.290]  And the man responsible for leaking these videos seems to be Lieutenant Commander Edward Lynn.
[01:02:23.290 --> 01:02:29.192]  He was accused of being a spy, but court transcripts prove that this was just spin.
[01:02:29.192 --> 01:02:34.254]  The details of his crimes, including the time they happened, are redacted.
[01:02:34.254 --> 01:02:40.116]  But it came out in the trial that the classified information in question was published on the internet.
[01:02:40.116 --> 01:02:46.779]  And Lieutenant Commander Edward Lynn had full security clearance to the same technology used to capture these videos.
[01:02:47.663 --> 01:03:00.674]  Using Inmarsat satellite ping data and military radar to track its path, and eyewitness testimony to verify it, Forbes put together the final flight path of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370.
[01:03:00.674 --> 01:03:08.881]  On March 7th at 1642 UTC, Flight 370 takes off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport.
[01:03:09.581 --> 01:03:16.069]  At 1721, the plane abruptly turns back towards the nearest airport in Penang.
[01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:19.654]  A witness on an oil rig reported that the plane was on fire.
[01:03:19.654 --> 01:03:27.163]  Several witnesses along the east coast reported hearing a loud bang and seeing a glow coming from the plane as it passed overhead.
[01:03:28.104 --> 01:03:33.529]  At 1752, the co-pilot's mobile phone pings the local tower.
[01:03:33.529 --> 01:03:40.535]  At 1840, an eyewitness on a boat reported that the plane was glowing orange and appeared on fire.
[01:03:40.535 --> 01:03:49.142]  The Inmarsat ping data shows the same sharp left turn that we see in the videos, and then abruptly goes to zero as the plane disappears.
[01:03:49.822 --> 01:03:55.345]  The CCP released Chinese satellite images that appear to be three orbs.
[01:03:55.345 --> 01:04:00.869]  They first claimed it was debris, and later said that releasing the image was a mistake.
[01:04:00.869 --> 01:04:11.315]  According to Chinese media, 19 families have signed a statement claiming they made calls that connected to missing passengers after the disappearance, but without an answer.
[01:04:12.512 --> 01:04:21.180]  Some people are saying this was alien UFOs saving a plane from crashing, but this doesn't explain the fact that three different advanced U.S.
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:26.004]  military surveillance cameras captured this one event.
[01:04:26.004 --> 01:04:33.691]  23 of the passengers on board were related to free-scale semiconductors, a field leading the development of superconductor technology.
[01:04:34.151 --> 01:04:36.011]  Which is what this appears to be.
[01:04:36.011 --> 01:04:39.892]  Some type of superconductor targeting system for teleportation.
[01:04:39.892 --> 01:04:46.314]  Which is reminiscent of what the Nazis were doing with their highly classified Die Glock project.
[01:04:46.314 --> 01:04:52.715]  Luminous objects like this were first reported in May of 1940, as Germany invaded Belgium.
[01:04:52.715 --> 01:04:56.376]  And by 1942, several people began reporting them.
[01:04:56.376 --> 01:04:58.136]  Starting in the skies over Germany.
[01:04:59.684 --> 01:05:01.085]  Bodies is back!
[01:05:01.085 --> 01:05:08.488]  The ultimate tumeric product on the market has returned to Infowarsstore.com and is now 25% off for a limited time.
[01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:13.871]  Utilized for thousands of years, tumeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[01:05:13.871 --> 01:05:21.515]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of tumeric and its active components.
[01:05:21.815 --> 01:05:32.724]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[01:05:32.724 --> 01:05:44.473]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract using bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[01:05:44.713 --> 01:05:48.197]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system.

[01:06:10.882 --> 01:06:13.484]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:06:13.484 --> 01:06:15.225]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:15.225 --> 01:06:20.888]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:20.888 --> 01:06:26.751]  I'm gonna get coming up later in the hour into the huge global awakening and Patriots winning elections all over the world.
[01:06:26.751 --> 01:06:33.395]  But I want to get into the military geopolitical news right now because this is such a big deal.
[01:06:33.395 --> 01:06:36.777]  Probably should have led the whole show tonight, but here we are into hour two.
[01:06:36.777 --> 01:06:37.618]  We're covering it right now.
[01:06:39.019 --> 01:06:44.941]  So, anybody that even pays attention knows what happened with Ukraine.
[01:06:44.941 --> 01:06:50.702]  I've never been to Russia, I'm not a Russophile, but I'm not a Russophobe.
[01:06:50.702 --> 01:06:53.483]  And I know what happened.
[01:06:53.483 --> 01:07:01.505]  And I know they made a deal at the end of the Soviet Union for it to collapse, so they would not expand into NATO, and NATO would not expand into them.
[01:07:01.505 --> 01:07:04.726]  Then in Ukraine in 2000, and what was it, 2012 or whatever,
[01:07:09.594 --> 01:07:15.058]  They overthrew repeated governments that were not anti-Russian.
[01:07:15.058 --> 01:07:24.966]  And then nine years ago, they had a huge coup and killed thousands of police and military and blew up the Capitol.
[01:07:24.966 --> 01:07:38.356]  And George Soros went on national television, I play this probably 50 times, on Fareed Zarkaria, eight years ago, right after it happened, about a year after it happened, and said, well,
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.941]  They're calling me the czar of Russia now.
[01:07:41.941 --> 01:07:53.545]  I'm going to defeat Russia, I'm going to overthrow it, meaning he was trying to have a coup in Russia and trying to stir Russia up into a confrontation.
[01:07:53.545 --> 01:08:04.348]  And they brag now, we got $5 billion of State Department money to overthrow the Ukrainian government and Russia is more than 50% pure Russian.
[01:08:04.348 --> 01:08:06.629]  Russia was founded there a thousand years ago.
[01:08:06.629 --> 01:08:08.270]  There's been major battles there in World War II.
[01:08:09.677 --> 01:08:18.199]  You saw a few months ago that the famous Nazi SS officer did a standing ovation with Zelensky, and they said he fought the Russians in World War II.
[01:08:18.199 --> 01:08:20.060]  Well, who fought the Russians in World War II?
[01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:23.081]  The Nazis.
[01:08:23.081 --> 01:08:28.122]  And so when Putin says we're fighting the Nazis and the Azov battalions, that was true.
[01:08:28.122 --> 01:08:28.862]  It's a fact.
[01:08:28.862 --> 01:08:31.223]  It's not like I'm for Putin or against Putin.
[01:08:31.223 --> 01:08:33.203]  It's just I'm for truth.
[01:08:33.203 --> 01:08:35.024]  And so I'm looking at that and saying, OK, that's true.
[01:08:36.198 --> 01:08:42.145]  And so, you've got areas in eastern Ukraine that are 99% Russian.
[01:08:42.145 --> 01:08:47.691]  And as you go further west, towards Poland, and the rest of it, it's more like 50% Russian.
[01:08:47.691 --> 01:08:49.153]  But it's mainly Russian.
[01:08:49.153 --> 01:08:51.255]  70% or so.
[01:08:54.193 --> 01:08:56.094]  Ukrainian is Russian.
[01:08:56.094 --> 01:09:00.216]  But kind of like, it's Texas speech versus New York speech.
[01:09:00.216 --> 01:09:01.036]  There's little differences.
[01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:05.938]  It's like Mexicans that live next to Texas, they speak Spanglish.
[01:09:05.938 --> 01:09:07.979]  Instead of Castilian, they speak in Spain.
[01:09:07.979 --> 01:09:09.140]  But it's Russian.
[01:09:11.624 --> 01:09:22.990]  And so, NATO and the U.S., our hijacked government, the same ones that dissolved our borders, are shipping fentanyl in, and are trying to cut our sons, and are not trying, they're succeeding, cut our sons' penises off.
[01:09:22.990 --> 01:09:31.374]  That same group has been shelling and attacking eastern Ukraine and southern Ukraine.
[01:09:31.374 --> 01:09:38.418]  And so five years ago, Vladimir Putin said, screw this, and came into their only deepwater port in the Black Sea and took it over.
[01:09:41.372 --> 01:09:44.214]  In southern Ukraine.
[01:09:44.214 --> 01:09:45.534]  Ukraine.
[01:09:45.534 --> 01:09:52.378]  It's now this major war zone, this major proxy war, this hybrid war.
[01:09:52.378 --> 01:10:02.223]  And so now we know, we knew it back in the time, Putin went in and he said, I don't want the whole country, I just want these areas, I want you to agree to disband your military attacks, and we will leave.
[01:10:02.223 --> 01:10:04.505]  They didn't do that.
[01:10:04.505 --> 01:10:10.688]  And our own media denied that that was what Putin wanted, and that that was Putin's objective, even though it was the public objective.
[01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:24.237]  Well, now Kiev's top member of parliament, who's the head of Zelensky's party, says Ukraine conflict could have ended in the spring of 2022.
[01:10:24.237 --> 01:10:27.679]  We have a video of it, but it's in Russian slash Ukrainian.
[01:10:27.679 --> 01:10:31.262]  I'm not going to play it here, but we'll show you a B-roll.
[01:10:31.262 --> 01:10:33.364]  And he's admitted this at other big events.
[01:10:33.364 --> 01:10:37.567]  Why are they suddenly admitting what was admitted almost two years ago?
[01:10:38.902 --> 01:10:41.044]  Because they're getting ready to get rid of Zelensky.
[01:10:41.044 --> 01:10:54.133]  They've pumped hundreds of billions in, the Russians have lost hundreds of thousands, the Ukrainians have lost hundreds of thousands, but Russia has effectively, like Colonel McGregor predicted, won this war.
[01:10:54.133 --> 01:10:59.857]  And this is the biggest war that the West has fought since World War II.
[01:10:59.857 --> 01:11:03.980]  The Iran-Iraq war killed over a million on both sides, so that's the biggest war
[01:11:05.424 --> 01:11:08.345]  Really since World War II is the Iran-Iraq War.
[01:11:08.345 --> 01:11:14.506]  But for Western wars, this is the biggest war since World War II.
[01:11:14.506 --> 01:11:19.147]  We lost 58,000 Americans in Vietnam.
[01:11:19.147 --> 01:11:23.408]  The estimates vary up to a million on the Vietnamese side, but you can debate this all day.
[01:11:23.408 --> 01:11:25.309]  The point is, this is a big war.
[01:11:25.309 --> 01:11:27.249]  This is a full war.
[01:11:27.249 --> 01:11:31.110]  This is leading to a larger full World War III scenario.
[01:11:32.935 --> 01:11:38.059]  So why has the head of Zelensky's party come out and said, we could have ended this and we shouldn't have?
[01:11:38.059 --> 01:11:43.444]  Because the State Department is telling Zelensky, all right, we lost, go ahead and quit.
[01:11:43.444 --> 01:11:44.805]  Europe's not getting its gas.
[01:11:44.805 --> 01:11:47.887]  Biden thought blowing up the pipeline would make the Russians give up.
[01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:51.150]  They're making record money selling their stuff to India and China.
[01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:52.251]  They're fossil fuels.
[01:11:54.261 --> 01:11:56.382]  But this is all about the newest thing.
[01:11:56.382 --> 01:11:58.282]  You know, oh, it's COVID.
[01:11:58.282 --> 01:11:59.742]  And then it's global warming.
[01:11:59.742 --> 01:12:02.503]  And now it's Israel and Hamas.
[01:12:02.503 --> 01:12:05.984]  And they just move on to the next thing.
[01:12:05.984 --> 01:12:11.585]  So we should be asking ourselves, what is the next thing going to be?
[01:12:11.585 --> 01:12:15.226]  Stock market crashes, power outages they blame on Trump supporters.
[01:12:15.226 --> 01:12:17.267]  They're already pre-programming that.
[01:12:17.267 --> 01:12:18.767]  I don't know what they're going to pull.
[01:12:18.767 --> 01:12:19.907]  I know what cards they've got.
[01:12:19.907 --> 01:12:22.448]  They've got six or eight cards in their hand.
[01:12:24.739 --> 01:12:27.140]  And they're going to play them.
[01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:33.201]  So that's the whole point of this broadcast is this isn't some football game where the game ends, doesn't matter who won.
[01:12:33.201 --> 01:12:34.761]  This is for everything.
[01:12:34.761 --> 01:12:39.302]  The end of a global debt bubble, a new world order, central bank digital currencies.
[01:12:39.302 --> 01:12:40.683]  It's all here.
[01:12:40.683 --> 01:12:41.763]  New lockdowns ready.
[01:12:41.763 --> 01:12:43.163]  They're pushing right now.
[01:12:43.163 --> 01:12:47.744]  Cover it in detail tomorrow on the Monday Show.
[01:12:47.744 --> 01:12:51.885]  Putin says he's ready to end war as fighting with Ukraine is tragedy.
[01:12:52.566 --> 01:13:02.709]  Dredge Report, run by the Democratic Party now, said Putin blinks.
[01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:04.790]  No, Putin's won the war.
[01:13:04.790 --> 01:13:07.230]  He doesn't want to kill more Russians and more Ukrainians.
[01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:09.731]  He wants a deal that Ukraine's not going to join NATO.
[01:13:09.731 --> 01:13:13.632]  The same thing he's been asking for for nine years.
[01:13:13.632 --> 01:13:16.193]  So I want to play you a video that Tucker Carlson talked about.
[01:13:17.884 --> 01:13:19.926]  In a big speech he gave last week.
[01:13:19.926 --> 01:13:24.569]  And this video is so poignant and so powerful.
[01:13:24.569 --> 01:13:29.413]  You notice if you look at the epaulets on their uniforms, if you look at their uniforms, they're privates.
[01:13:29.413 --> 01:13:33.756]  And the average age of these men is probably 60 years old.
[01:13:33.756 --> 01:13:35.337]  Some look like they're 70.
[01:13:35.337 --> 01:13:37.759]  Some look like they're 45 or 50.
[01:13:37.759 --> 01:13:41.942]  And they've got this Ukrainian dancer sing to them what heroes they are.
[01:13:41.942 --> 01:13:46.105]  Alright, they're Ukrainians, they've been ordered up.
[01:13:46.105 --> 01:13:46.586]  They're there.
[01:13:48.579 --> 01:13:52.701]  And look at them, they know they're dead men walking for a fraud.
[01:13:52.701 --> 01:13:54.761]  They know their families will be put in prison.
[01:13:54.761 --> 01:13:56.402]  They know they'll be put in jail.
[01:13:56.402 --> 01:14:01.464]  They know if they don't go join this meat grinder that this is going to happen.
[01:14:01.464 --> 01:14:12.008]  So this is Zelensky, the cokehead, gay prostitute, that's what he is, totally compromised, is siphoning off money from the war effort,
[01:14:12.873 --> 01:14:14.113]  Money laundering.
[01:14:14.113 --> 01:14:23.136]  And then this woman comes out and sings to them about how great they are with a siren song of their death and their destruction.
[01:14:23.136 --> 01:14:24.697]  We're going to come back from break.
[01:14:24.697 --> 01:14:28.458]  We're going to play this clip.
[01:14:28.458 --> 01:14:29.658]  But I'm going for memory.
[01:14:29.658 --> 01:14:31.539]  What's the population of Ukraine?
[01:14:31.539 --> 01:14:32.519]  35?
[01:14:32.519 --> 01:14:33.560]  36 million?
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:33.940]  Look it up.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:34.720]  I'm going for memory.
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.301]  Let me test my memory.
[01:14:36.301 --> 01:14:36.881]  Russia's 260 million.
[01:14:38.612 --> 01:14:40.193]  Look up both, I'm going from memory.
[01:14:40.193 --> 01:14:45.738]  Russia's 200 plus million, they're 30 million, roughly.
[01:14:45.738 --> 01:14:52.723]  And they're up against one of the biggest militaries in the world, funded by NATO, and they're getting destroyed everywhere.
[01:14:52.723 --> 01:15:02.791]  And Putin said two years ago, I don't know if he was right, he said we're going to set this line up, we're going to call them in, we're going to kill them all.
[01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:04.552]  He said we're going to set up a line with NATO,
[01:15:05.566 --> 01:15:08.268]  And we're ready for the sacrifice, just like we fought Hitler.
[01:15:08.268 --> 01:15:10.929]  Bring them on, we're gonna kill every one of them, they'll all burn.
[01:15:10.929 --> 01:15:21.356]  Alright, so, I guess if you add some of the satellites, right, it's 200-something million, but it's 144 million, and then what's the population of Ukraine?
[01:15:21.356 --> 01:15:23.117]  36 million, so I got that number right.
[01:15:23.117 --> 01:15:27.920]  Then if you add the old quasi-satellites, it's 200-something million, but the point is, is that you've got
[01:15:29.502 --> 01:15:33.344]  This going on, and they lied to you, all so U.S.
[01:15:33.344 --> 01:15:35.985]  defense contractors can make hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:15:35.985 --> 01:15:39.106]  They lied and said they could win, but now they know they're not winning.
[01:15:39.106 --> 01:15:42.147]  And it's the same thing with everything they sell.
[01:15:42.147 --> 01:15:43.668]  Everything they do, it's a lie.
[01:15:43.668 --> 01:15:44.528]  It's all a fraud.
[01:15:44.528 --> 01:15:47.109]  They say, suck it up and accept the fentanyl.
[01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:48.970]  Suck it up and accept the inflation.
[01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:50.891]  Suck it up and accept the open borders.
[01:15:50.891 --> 01:15:52.551]  Suck it up and accept the wars.
[01:15:52.551 --> 01:15:54.332]  Suck it up and take the refugees.
[01:15:54.332 --> 01:15:56.313]  How about you suck it up and hang from the end of a rope?
[01:15:59.138 --> 01:16:04.934]  A lot of people have asked me, why is M4 Store and M4's life not in a probiotic for more than three years?
[01:16:05.370 --> 01:16:06.591]  The answer is simple.
[01:16:06.591 --> 01:16:09.533]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[01:16:09.533 --> 01:16:14.016]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[01:16:14.016 --> 01:16:19.840]  They got bought by a libtard company and said, we're not doing business with you Mr. Jones anymore.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:25.343]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[01:16:25.343 --> 01:16:29.906]  We're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula.

[01:20:15.213 --> 01:20:28.702]  So imagine the CIA that's literally running the transgender movement, target-promoting pedophilia, Satanism, all the major corporate media hijacked, government's gone, backing Xi Jinping against America.
[01:20:28.702 --> 01:20:35.007]  Imagine, they know the Russians have multi-million man armies.
[01:20:36.451 --> 01:20:51.807]  And they know Ukraine is 36 million people, and they know they've overthrown the government, and they know they're attacking the Russian population in eastern Ukraine with artillery every day for years, and pissing Putin off to sneak him into a trap.
[01:20:51.807 --> 01:20:54.089]  And Putin says, I'm not going to take the whole country.
[01:20:54.089 --> 01:20:56.111]  I'm just going to set up a line here and destroy your troops.
[01:20:57.287 --> 01:21:04.570]  And I said, well, Putin's walking into a trap, which it was a trap for hundreds of thousands, some estimates are 400,000, low estimates 200,000.
[01:21:04.570 --> 01:21:08.072]  Russia admits hundreds of thousands of dead Russians, okay?
[01:21:08.072 --> 01:21:12.354]  Which is nothing compared to fighting Hitler, 27 million is the high estimate, 25 is the low.
[01:21:13.194 --> 01:21:14.655]  I was like third of the population.
[01:21:14.655 --> 01:21:19.177]  So nobody's ever lost more troops in a war than the Russians.
[01:21:19.177 --> 01:21:21.038]  Second is the Germans.
[01:21:21.038 --> 01:21:22.858]  And again, both my grandfathers were in World War Two.
[01:21:22.858 --> 01:21:27.000]  I'm not taking away from that and the 300,000 death the US side.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:31.062]  But we were a bystander to World War Two.
[01:21:31.062 --> 01:21:36.344]  It was the Russians and the Germans in toe to toe slaughtering each other.
[01:21:36.344 --> 01:21:39.746]  Just absolute wholesale mass death.
[01:21:42.336 --> 01:21:45.499]  Absolutely insane.
[01:21:45.499 --> 01:21:54.929]  And so then the remnants of those Nazis, because Ukraine was one of the main battlegrounds, Ukraine and Poland is where the main battles went on, and Western Russia, look at the history of it.
[01:21:58.305 --> 01:22:04.508]  Putin goes in and almost two years later, they've just annihilated the NATO forces, annihilated everything they're going to send in.
[01:22:04.508 --> 01:22:05.329]  And that's what Putin said.
[01:22:05.329 --> 01:22:07.730]  He said, just bring your weapons, we're going to burn them.
[01:22:07.730 --> 01:22:09.030]  Just bring it all here.
[01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:10.471]  Let's get this over with now.
[01:22:10.471 --> 01:22:11.632]  We're going to burn it all.
[01:22:11.632 --> 01:22:13.473]  So they actually walked into Putin's trap.
[01:22:13.473 --> 01:22:17.435]  And I can say in the final equation, Putin set the trap.
[01:22:17.435 --> 01:22:18.935]  He did it.
[01:22:18.935 --> 01:22:21.937]  And Napoleon Bonaparte and Hitler both got defeated in Russia.
[01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.858]  NATO just got defeated in Russia.
[01:22:25.219 --> 01:22:26.020]  Here's the problem.
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:29.404]  NATO already blew up the Nord Stream Pipeline and did a bunch of other crazy crap.
[01:22:29.404 --> 01:22:31.647]  They may give nuclear weapons to Kiev.
[01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:32.769]  They're that crazy.
[01:22:32.769 --> 01:22:36.454]  But most of the smart money, including Henry Kissinger, is against ending this now.
[01:22:37.950 --> 01:22:48.218]  That's why they've segued over into Israel and the Middle East trying to get a war going with Iran, because they want distractions from the big global financial bubble that's imploding.
[01:22:48.218 --> 01:22:51.761]  They want to blame whatever's about to come on that.
[01:22:51.761 --> 01:22:55.063]  But here's the video with audio from just last week.
[01:22:58.345 --> 01:22:59.506]  Privates.
[01:22:59.506 --> 01:23:03.129]  Now you think of a private as like an 18-year-old, a 20-year-old, wet behind the ears.
[01:23:03.129 --> 01:23:11.536]  No, these are old men, average age 60, and they got a woman singing to them about how great they are, about to march off and die.
[01:23:11.536 --> 01:23:12.697]  Watch the video closely.
[01:23:12.697 --> 01:23:13.858]  Does it look like they're buying it?
[01:23:13.858 --> 01:23:14.219]  Here it is.
[01:23:40.656 --> 01:23:43.898]  So you got 36 million Russians.
[01:23:43.898 --> 01:23:45.159]  That's Ukrainians, they're Russians.
[01:23:45.159 --> 01:23:47.982]  In fact, they're like the original pedigree of the Russians.
[01:23:47.982 --> 01:23:49.963]  They're like, you could say, oh, those are the real Russians.
[01:23:49.963 --> 01:23:54.407]  You've got the Russians fighting hundreds of millions of Russians, and they're like,
[01:23:56.220 --> 01:24:07.215]  They got some woman dancing and singing them a song, how great they are, and they know, we're just here so Zelensky can snort more cocaine, and so NATO can think they're beating Russia.
[01:24:09.346 --> 01:24:11.167]  But Russia's gotten stronger.
[01:24:11.167 --> 01:24:15.109]  Russia's making more money, more oil, more gas, making all these deals.
[01:24:15.109 --> 01:24:17.530]  But of course, at the higher level, the globalists know that.
[01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:21.432]  Just like they got Israel to stand down and let the Hamas attack happen.
[01:24:21.432 --> 01:24:28.856]  And then they had the media allow all the horrible stuff Israel did out on purpose to set Israel up as well.
[01:24:28.856 --> 01:24:30.817]  Any idiot can see that.
[01:24:30.817 --> 01:24:33.799]  But not the delusional people running Israel.
[01:24:33.799 --> 01:24:35.240]  Not the Ukrainian leadership.
[01:24:36.954 --> 01:24:41.696]  I predict Zelensky's going to end up dead or in prison.
[01:24:41.696 --> 01:24:42.856]  90% chance.
[01:24:42.856 --> 01:24:46.917]  10% chance he runs off to some other country, like the U.S., Miami or something.
[01:24:46.917 --> 01:24:48.578]  He's already bought a big palace there.
[01:24:48.578 --> 01:24:51.098]  But he's done.
[01:24:51.098 --> 01:24:58.921]  So, the globalists have lost the propaganda war with Israel, because that's part of a larger plan, though.
[01:24:58.921 --> 01:25:00.822]  They've lost the war with Russia.
[01:25:00.822 --> 01:25:02.642]  What are they going to pull next?
[01:25:02.642 --> 01:25:05.143]  And in my experience, when the New World Order loses,
[01:25:07.062 --> 01:25:09.883]  What do they do?
[01:25:09.883 --> 01:25:10.984]  They double down.
[01:25:10.984 --> 01:25:12.825]  Yeah, just keep, blow up the video.
[01:25:12.825 --> 01:25:17.487]  Just show these men, average age, 60 plus years old.
[01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:22.030]  They've literally killed almost all the young men.
[01:25:22.030 --> 01:25:26.032]  And then they go and conscript like video game players, like 18 year olds.
[01:25:26.032 --> 01:25:28.053]  So now they've gone and gotten all the veterans.
[01:25:29.557 --> 01:25:31.618]  Or like, OK, I'm not going to not follow an order.
[01:25:31.618 --> 01:25:33.640]  I'm going to go fight the Russians.
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:49.990]  And I know they're being fed directly into a meat grinder so that every artillery shell and every javelin missile that is shipped in there by NATO, Zelensky and Biden and the rest of them get a cut of that.
[01:25:49.990 --> 01:25:53.192]  They're cannon fodder, food for cannons.
[01:25:53.192 --> 01:25:55.093]  They know Russia won.
[01:25:55.093 --> 01:25:57.735]  And they're sitting there going,
[01:25:59.144 --> 01:26:07.680]  Well, I got grandkids and I own a business here and I'm gonna go get killed for them and at least my wife and grandkids and everybody will still have the business.
[01:26:09.422 --> 01:26:10.963]  Literally, because they've got to do as ours.
[01:26:10.963 --> 01:26:15.185]  Well, I know I'm going to die, but they'll take our family business if we don't do this.
[01:26:15.185 --> 01:26:16.265]  These are real men, actually.
[01:26:16.265 --> 01:26:17.246]  Put them up.
[01:26:17.246 --> 01:26:21.447]  They didn't run away like a million-plus Ukrainian men to the West.
[01:26:21.447 --> 01:26:24.789]  A million-plus is in the news if run to Europe or the U.S.
[01:26:24.789 --> 01:26:27.790]  These guys are like, all right, we'll follow the orders.
[01:26:27.790 --> 01:26:33.693]  We're going to go die next week into a Russian military trap.
[01:26:35.515 --> 01:26:41.578]  So Zelensky can dance around in a leather outfit in high heels and play the piano with his penis.
[01:26:41.578 --> 01:26:49.341]  It's always, it's always, nothing against gay people, but like, we've gotta die so a dude can play a piano with his penis.
[01:26:49.341 --> 01:26:52.962]  We've gotta die so that Chuckie Schumer can feel powerful.
[01:26:52.962 --> 01:26:59.185]  And so that Blinken, the Secretary of State, can go and like, sit around a table and feel powerful.
[01:26:59.185 --> 01:27:04.447]  I'll never forget a New York Times article, which I don't believe the New York Times, but it was in a bunch of articles, and I told people, I told somebody that was there,
[01:27:06.295 --> 01:27:23.389]  One of the top neocons, his name will pop in my head in a minute, Richard Perle, in like 19, it was 2004, so a year into the Iraq War, just killed another million Iraqis with starvation and war.
[01:27:23.389 --> 01:27:30.975]  And he walked up to some hot reporter and said, you know, he's like weighs 500 pounds, huge black circles around his eyes.
[01:27:30.975 --> 01:27:34.558]  He thought it would impress a woman to say to her, he goes, you know, I kill a lot of people.
[01:27:36.087 --> 01:27:36.828]  You can read the article.
[01:27:36.828 --> 01:27:38.209]  He goes, I kill a lot of people.
[01:27:38.209 --> 01:27:40.311]  That was back when the New York Times was totally controlled.
[01:27:40.311 --> 01:27:41.512]  He goes, you know, I kill a lot of people.
[01:27:41.512 --> 01:27:44.634]  I'm powerful.
[01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:46.776]  I command troops that have killed millions.
[01:27:46.776 --> 01:27:51.420]  And the woman began to basically become sick.
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:54.703]  Imagine how disconnected Richard, pull up Richard Perle's photo.
[01:27:54.703 --> 01:27:56.104]  Is he even alive still?
[01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:57.785]  Pull up Richard Perle's photo.
[01:27:57.785 --> 01:28:01.909]  Imagine a man so disconnected, probably never even had sex with a woman.
[01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:10.152]  Then he walks over at a cocktail party to the Washington Post and the New York Times and says, you know, I've killed a lot of people.
[01:28:10.152 --> 01:28:13.933]  Dude, you can't wipe your fat, disgusting ass.
[01:28:13.933 --> 01:28:17.955]  You think women want a person that's killed a bunch of people?
[01:28:17.955 --> 01:28:24.236]  Women want somebody that's protected people, not somebody that brags about how they killed people.
[01:28:24.236 --> 01:28:29.298]  And that's the disconnect to the new world order, ladies and gentlemen, is these people are degenerate scum.
[01:28:30.782 --> 01:28:32.182]  They are trash.
[01:28:32.182 --> 01:28:34.243]  They are the ultimate filth.
[01:28:34.243 --> 01:28:35.943]  They are cowards!
[01:28:35.943 --> 01:28:39.004]  But let me tell you what's worse, being us under their control.
[01:28:39.004 --> 01:28:40.805]  I'm sick of them ruling us.
[01:28:40.805 --> 01:28:43.145]  I'm sick of them in control of our destiny.
[01:28:43.145 --> 01:28:44.566]  And I'm sick of them all.
[01:28:44.566 --> 01:28:46.426]  Look at that.
[01:28:46.426 --> 01:28:50.627]  Look at Richard Perle, bragging to women how many men he's killed.
[01:28:50.627 --> 01:28:53.888]  You didn't kill anybody, you weak piece of filth!
[01:28:59.116 --> 01:29:07.280]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through diet.
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:17.704]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban it, and they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[01:29:19.085 --> 01:29:23.932]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.

[01:33:52.641 --> 01:33:55.383]  Recognized as the most effective, the most accurate.
[01:33:55.383 --> 01:34:00.867]  Our guests, our crew, myself, the listeners, we have done it!
[01:34:00.867 --> 01:34:03.369]  We're putting up a real fight against tyranny!
[01:34:05.448 --> 01:34:07.409]  We don't have the backing of the big banks.
[01:34:07.409 --> 01:34:10.030]  We don't have the backing of the UN or Klaus Schwab.
[01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:13.311]  We got the backing of We The People.
[01:34:13.311 --> 01:34:15.172]  And we are fighting back.
[01:34:15.172 --> 01:34:19.994]  And I am so proud to be associated with all of you.

[01:34:32.439 --> 01:34:33.019]  Yeah!
[01:34:34.295 --> 01:34:38.739]  Woo!
[01:34:38.739 --> 01:34:40.440]  Four Young Chiquitas in Omaha!
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:44.744]  Four Young Chiquitas in Omaha!
[01:34:44.744 --> 01:34:49.507]  Was waiting for the band to return from the show!
[01:34:49.507 --> 01:34:54.692]  Feeling good, feeling right, it's Saturday night!
[01:34:54.692 --> 01:34:57.574]  The hotel detective, he was out of sight!
[01:35:08.104 --> 01:35:09.405]  We're part of the human future.
[01:35:09.405 --> 01:35:11.566]  We're part of a pro-human world.
[01:35:11.566 --> 01:35:15.208]  We want prosperity and freedom and justice and competition.
[01:35:15.208 --> 01:35:16.908]  We want it all.
[01:35:16.908 --> 01:35:19.630]  Everything God promised us.
[01:35:19.630 --> 01:35:25.692]  We're coming to your town.
[01:35:25.692 --> 01:35:28.814]  And anybody that attacks the Republic will go after them.
[01:35:28.814 --> 01:35:29.194]  Know that.
[01:35:31.571 --> 01:35:43.518]  You just saw members of Congress earlier, Senator Josh Hawley and others, say the number one enemy of America and Senator Kennedy, all of them, is the globalists, is the FBI, the people running our country.
[01:35:43.518 --> 01:35:46.120]  I'm not at war with the FBI.
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:48.101]  That's another bureaucracy.
[01:35:48.101 --> 01:35:51.123]  But you made yourselves enemies, the American people.
[01:35:51.123 --> 01:35:56.586]  You followed a Marxist-Leninist agenda to say you want to fight with us.
[01:35:56.586 --> 01:35:57.887]  We're not going to go blow something up.
[01:35:58.649 --> 01:36:02.792]  We're going to destroy your lies, and we're going to discredit you all the way, and we're going to win.
[01:36:02.792 --> 01:36:07.655]  All right, folks.
[01:36:07.655 --> 01:36:10.216]  Let me get into the New World Order section of tonight's broadcast.
[01:36:10.216 --> 01:36:16.180]  And, you know, I should have gotten to this earlier, because the time we've got left, we've got some big interviews coming up on Sunday Night Live, 6 p.m.
[01:36:16.180 --> 01:36:18.461]  Central, and just like 24, 23 minutes from now,
[01:36:23.103 --> 01:36:25.204]  Man, these clips are incredible.
[01:36:25.204 --> 01:36:27.965]  In fact, I'm mad at myself because I already know all this.
[01:36:27.965 --> 01:36:29.106]  Most of you know more than I do.
[01:36:29.106 --> 01:36:30.727]  A lot of you know as much as I do.
[01:36:30.727 --> 01:36:32.647]  Some of you don't know as much as I do.
[01:36:32.647 --> 01:36:38.130]  But I'm sitting here, and I mean, I'm reading what comes out of the Club of Rome, the UN, the Davos Group.
[01:36:38.130 --> 01:36:41.131]  I mean, it's just like fantastic evil.
[01:36:41.131 --> 01:36:42.632]  Humanity's over.
[01:36:42.632 --> 01:36:44.073]  It's the end of humans.
[01:36:44.073 --> 01:36:45.533]  We're going to euthanize everybody.
[01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:47.954]  I mean, this is the sickest crap I've ever heard.
[01:36:47.954 --> 01:36:51.216]  And I got to sit here and have a debate with you about whether it's going on or not?
[01:36:55.168 --> 01:37:02.576]  These people run the show, and I'm tired of them running the show.
[01:37:02.576 --> 01:37:06.901]  I want to roll up my sleeves and stop this.
[01:37:06.901 --> 01:37:11.186]  Because look, we're going to have problems in the future.
[01:37:11.186 --> 01:37:14.430]  But I can deal with a boss hog that just wants to be the top dog.
[01:37:15.886 --> 01:37:31.772]  I would still oppose Boss Hogg, but if Boss Hogg was promoting freedom and families and money and success, he just wanted to be in charge and was screwing folks over to get it, I'd be like, I'll oppose him, but I'm not gonna risk my life to beat Boss Hogg.
[01:37:31.772 --> 01:37:36.134]  Let's come in with the Waylon Jennings, Dukes of Hazzard intro.
[01:37:36.134 --> 01:37:41.296]  Let's play the whole song next segment.
[01:37:41.296 --> 01:37:42.677]  But what I'm getting at here is,
[01:37:44.264 --> 01:37:45.865]  This thing's anti-human.
[01:37:45.865 --> 01:37:53.110]  This thing is a corporate takeover to turn us into like lab rats or factory farm creatures in their own words.
[01:37:53.110 --> 01:38:01.916]  So I fundamentally love my ancestors, and I fundamentally love my family, and I fundamentally love our progeny and our future.
[01:38:01.916 --> 01:38:03.597]  And I'm on Team Humanity, baby.
[01:38:03.597 --> 01:38:07.119]  And I'm like, man, you have fundamentally pissed me off.
[01:38:07.119 --> 01:38:13.263]  You have fundamentally driven me to insane levels.
[01:38:13.263 --> 01:38:13.904]  I look at Russia.
[01:38:16.408 --> 01:38:18.229]  Where they're outlawing transgenderism.
[01:38:18.229 --> 01:38:19.649]  Where they're promoting having more kids.
[01:38:19.649 --> 01:38:21.270]  They're promoting Christianity.
[01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:22.851]  You say, oh that's fake!
[01:38:22.851 --> 01:38:23.831]  They don't really mean that.
[01:38:23.831 --> 01:38:28.133]  That's a bunch of controlled CIA bullshit.
[01:38:28.133 --> 01:38:30.194]  Bullshit!
[01:38:30.194 --> 01:38:32.895]  Bullshit!
[01:38:32.895 --> 01:38:37.396]  They've already been sucked down for 80 years in the communist belly.
[01:38:37.396 --> 01:38:39.797]  And they somehow crawl back out of it.
[01:38:39.797 --> 01:38:41.018]  Out the ass end.
[01:38:41.018 --> 01:38:43.539]  And then you want to sit there and look at them and say, they're the enemy.
[01:38:44.707 --> 01:38:46.388]  Does Russia own Hollywood?
[01:38:46.388 --> 01:38:48.790]  No, China and the globalists do.
[01:38:48.790 --> 01:38:51.132]  And let me tell you, China's the big problem.
[01:38:51.132 --> 01:38:53.394]  Because it's a creation of the New World Order.
[01:38:53.394 --> 01:38:58.798]  But the thing that gave birth to Mao Zedong and Xi Jinping is ten times worse.
[01:38:58.798 --> 01:39:00.139]  So let's be clear.
[01:39:00.139 --> 01:39:07.505]  China is a secondary enemy compared to the bureaucracy and the pedophile deep state that runs our government.
[01:39:09.807 --> 01:39:23.053]  That is so divorced from reality and so nihilistic that they want a 15-front war with everybody in the world because they have a right to rule over everybody!
[01:39:23.053 --> 01:39:29.776]  And they don't.
[01:39:29.776 --> 01:39:33.498]  So I've got... Let's see.
[01:39:34.999 --> 01:39:37.100]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:46.722]  I got like over 10 clips of them announcing world government, cashless society, controlling every aspect of your life last week.
[01:39:46.722 --> 01:39:47.842]  Just right here.
[01:39:47.842 --> 01:39:51.163]  Tony Blair, UN, world government, total control, everything you do.
[01:39:51.163 --> 01:39:56.544]  I mean just absolute declaration of war against humanity right here.
[01:39:56.544 --> 01:39:59.525]  I was going to ask folks, do you really like getting raped?
[01:39:59.525 --> 01:40:00.725]  You really like being a slave?
[01:40:00.725 --> 01:40:02.066]  You really like bending over these people?
[01:40:02.066 --> 01:40:02.846]  Because I sure don't.
[01:40:08.379 --> 01:40:16.423]  And I'm sad for all the dead Ukrainians and all the dead Russians.
[01:40:16.423 --> 01:40:22.606]  But I'm really glad to see people stand up against Klaus Schwab and NATO, aren't you?
[01:40:22.606 --> 01:40:27.148]  Let's just be honest about that.
[01:40:27.148 --> 01:40:34.692]  I just wish Klaus Schwab and Bill Gates and Benjamin Netanyahu's sons were out there on the front lines.
[01:40:34.692 --> 01:40:37.954]  I love Netanyahu's son criticizing the Israeli military.
[01:40:39.315 --> 01:40:44.819]  Going into that Hamas hellhole, whether side you're for.
[01:40:44.819 --> 01:40:46.881]  You got balls going into that.
[01:40:46.881 --> 01:40:52.345]  He's in Miami sitting there on a pink pillow talking crap about the Israeli military.
[01:40:52.345 --> 01:41:03.033]  Imagine, you've never been in the military, you've never done anything, and you're going to criticize your own military your dad runs and say they should do a better job when you can't even find your ass with both hands.
[01:41:04.389 --> 01:41:05.950]  And I'm all on some jack incident.
[01:41:05.950 --> 01:41:11.834]  Yo, I'm saying what your son's saying is a load of horse manure.
[01:41:11.834 --> 01:41:12.815]  Alright, I said I'd get to it.
[01:41:12.815 --> 01:41:13.535]  We gotta go.
[01:41:13.535 --> 01:41:14.156]  Skip the break.
[01:41:14.156 --> 01:41:16.497]  We'll have more time.
[01:41:16.497 --> 01:41:18.058]  So I'll try to get to a bunch of these clips then.
[01:41:18.058 --> 01:41:20.060]  I mean, it's nauseating to watch.
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:20.840]  Here's my problem.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:22.581]  It's like a dog to vomit.
[01:41:22.581 --> 01:41:24.803]  I've already watched all this repeatedly.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.543]  And so I realized, I've psychoanalyzed myself.
[01:41:28.543 --> 01:41:30.606]  Why do I not want to play these clips?
[01:41:30.606 --> 01:41:31.968]  Why do I not want to cover these articles?
[01:41:31.968 --> 01:41:33.470]  Because I've already read it four or five times.
[01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:35.693]  I've already watched it three or four times.
[01:41:35.693 --> 01:41:40.079]  And it's so disgusting to listen to Tony Blair.
[01:41:44.642 --> 01:41:46.443]  To listen to Klaus Schwab.
[01:41:46.443 --> 01:41:50.024]  But we gotta... Or Yuval Noah Harari.
[01:41:50.024 --> 01:41:50.524]  Oh!
[01:41:50.524 --> 01:41:51.124]  Oh!
[01:41:51.124 --> 01:41:51.244]  Oh!
[01:41:51.244 --> 01:41:52.164]  You're so smart!
[01:41:52.164 --> 01:41:52.784]  Oh!
[01:41:52.784 --> 01:41:53.105]  Oh!
[01:41:53.105 --> 01:41:54.065]  Humans are dead!
[01:41:54.065 --> 01:41:54.945]  Humans are over!
[01:41:54.945 --> 01:41:56.566]  Just lay down and die!
[01:41:56.566 --> 01:41:58.366]  It's told in the stars!
[01:41:58.366 --> 01:42:03.128]  It's the way it is!
[01:42:03.128 --> 01:42:07.409]  Stop telling me my destiny, you sack of crap!
[01:42:07.409 --> 01:42:10.850]  In fact, a sack of crap can fertilize fields!
[01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:12.771]  That's too good for you!
[01:42:12.771 --> 01:42:13.731]  You're not a cockroach!
[01:42:14.807 --> 01:42:16.688]  You're not a sack of feces.
[01:42:16.688 --> 01:42:18.288]  You are poison.
[01:42:18.288 --> 01:42:19.649]  You are garbage.
[01:42:19.649 --> 01:42:20.789]  You're the enemy.
[01:42:20.789 --> 01:42:35.294]  And because you project the fact that you know you're a sack of garbage, you know you're a failure, you know you don't have vision, or scientific understanding, or a destiny for humanity, and you crap all over us and we're supposed to take it!
[01:42:35.294 --> 01:42:37.694]  And I'm not gonna take you anymore!
[01:42:37.694 --> 01:42:41.376]  I'm not gonna sit here and listen to you anymore!
[01:42:41.376 --> 01:42:42.696]  Damn you to hell!
[01:42:45.094 --> 01:42:50.200]  With my last breath, I spit at you!
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:53.444]  With every ounce of will I've got, I damn you!
[01:42:53.444 --> 01:42:59.151]  Well, we will go out with the next hazard.
[01:42:59.151 --> 01:42:59.692]  Last two minutes.
[01:43:06.479 --> 01:43:09.240]  They're so sick, they're so scared of a woman.
[01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:11.080]  A big, powerful woman.
[01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:16.641]  Like a real man wants a big, powerful, the highest horsepower, the wildest woman, the craziest thing they can get.
[01:43:16.641 --> 01:43:20.622]  These people are so insecure, they want to screw a five-year-old kid and take their innocence.
[01:43:20.622 --> 01:43:33.784]  Imagine, we're up against people that want to screw your children, that want to rape them physically and mentally and inject them with deadly poison because it makes them feel powerful to go to the shopping mall and see kids in wheelchairs everywhere.
[01:43:36.254 --> 01:43:36.554]  You know what?
[01:43:36.554 --> 01:43:38.435]  We're the problem, though.
[01:43:38.435 --> 01:43:39.176]  I'm the problem.
[01:43:39.176 --> 01:43:40.056]  You're the problem.
[01:43:40.056 --> 01:43:46.941]  That we let people like this do this to us, and I say, no more, baby!
[01:43:46.941 --> 01:43:48.742]  You want a war?
[01:43:48.742 --> 01:43:49.623]  You want it?
[01:43:49.623 --> 01:43:52.404]  You are gonna get it!
[01:43:52.404 --> 01:44:04.012]  But I tell you now, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, you all know Harari, Peter Daszak, the Rothschild leadership,
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:10.123]  Larry Fink, you will be destroyed.
[01:44:10.123 --> 01:44:13.526]  Just make sure everybody knows who did this.
[01:44:13.526 --> 01:44:15.927]  They've already cut off the fertilizer.
[01:44:15.927 --> 01:44:17.549]  The third world's already going down.
[01:44:17.549 --> 01:44:20.491]  Hell's already, there's no stopping it now.
[01:44:20.491 --> 01:44:24.994]  It's stopping how bad it's going to get, but there's no stopping how, that it's going to happen.
[01:44:27.239 --> 01:44:29.581]  So remember who took your food away.
[01:44:29.581 --> 01:44:31.282]  Remember who took your gas away.
[01:44:31.282 --> 01:44:32.863]  Remember who cut your medicine off.
[01:44:32.863 --> 01:44:34.365]  Remember who started the war.
[01:44:34.365 --> 01:44:35.826]  Remember who flooded your border.
[01:44:35.826 --> 01:44:38.308]  Remember when a legal alien runs your kid over on the street.
[01:44:38.308 --> 01:44:41.410]  Remember the New World Order did it.
[01:44:41.410 --> 01:44:44.813]  Remember when they take everything you've got like they're doing to me.
[01:44:44.813 --> 01:44:45.553]  That's fine.
[01:44:45.553 --> 01:44:46.034]  Good.
[01:44:46.034 --> 01:44:47.194]  I knew it was coming.
[01:44:47.194 --> 01:44:49.076]  I love it.
[01:44:49.076 --> 01:44:51.017]  I love every minute of it.
[01:44:51.017 --> 01:44:53.339]  I'm getting so close to getting my hands around your neck.
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:08.743]  You give me the guidance system to your heart, and I'm going to run that political sword right in you while you think you're taking me down, while your tentacles are sucking me dry and killing me.
[01:45:08.743 --> 01:45:09.504]  I'm alive.
[01:45:09.504 --> 01:45:18.966]  I'm running it in you, and I'm going to run it in you again, just like Captain Ahab with Moby Dick, and I'm going to go down with you, and you're never going to come back up again,
[01:45:19.326 --> 01:45:21.807]  Because I was made to harpoon your ass.
[01:45:21.807 --> 01:45:23.928]  I was made to get your ass.
[01:45:23.928 --> 01:45:25.869]  I was made to take you down.
[01:45:25.869 --> 01:45:29.992]  I was forged to come after you, and that's what I'm doing now.
[01:45:29.992 --> 01:45:31.833]  And you need to know that forever.
[01:45:31.833 --> 01:45:33.393]  You need to understand who got you.
[01:45:33.393 --> 01:45:35.494]  You need to understand who beat you.
[01:45:35.494 --> 01:45:42.218]  We've already beat you, and you'll never get all the people, and you'll never succeed, and you're gonna burn in hell.
[01:45:42.218 --> 01:45:45.980]  Now, with that light stuff, let's go ahead
[01:45:52.253 --> 01:45:59.768]  Let's now go to Senator Johnson and the Declaration of War Against Humanity.
[01:45:59.768 --> 01:46:00.108]  Here it is.
[01:46:01.454 --> 01:46:11.740]  It's just extraordinary to me that the government was working with social media to amplify lies and suppress truth and has been doing so repeatedly.
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:15.743]  Why can't the American people know that there were side effects with the vaccine?
[01:46:15.743 --> 01:46:19.365]  This was all pre-planned by an elite group of people.
[01:46:19.365 --> 01:46:21.346]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:46:21.346 --> 01:46:26.429]  Event 201 that occurred in late 2019 prior to the rest of us knowing about this pandemic.
[01:46:28.904 --> 01:46:37.868]  This is very concerning in terms of what has happened, what is happening, what continues to be planned for our loss of freedom.
[01:46:37.868 --> 01:46:43.730]  Again, it needs to be exposed, but unfortunately there are very few people, even in Congress, that are willing to take a look at this.
[01:46:44.850 --> 01:46:46.772]  They all push the vaccine.
[01:46:46.772 --> 01:46:52.495]  They don't want to be made aware of the fact that the vaccines might have caused injuries, might have caused death.
[01:46:52.495 --> 01:46:59.579]  So many people just simply don't want to admit they were wrong and they're going to do everything they can to make sure that they're not proven wrong.
[01:46:59.579 --> 01:47:02.841]  We're up against a very powerful group of people here, Maria.
[01:47:02.841 --> 01:47:05.503]  We need the truth to be exposed.
[01:47:05.503 --> 01:47:11.987]  We need more Americans to listen to the truth, to be exposed to the truth, to pull their heads out of the sand, quite honestly.
[01:47:13.789 --> 01:47:15.291]  What is happening in this country?
[01:47:15.291 --> 01:47:22.118]  We are going down a very dangerous path, but it's a path that is being laid out and planned by an elite group of people.
[01:47:23.217 --> 01:47:26.259]  That want to take total control over our lives.
[01:47:26.259 --> 01:47:28.161]  And that's what they're doing bit by bit.
[01:47:28.161 --> 01:47:35.226]  They do it by increasing massive government spending, increasing the size of government, take over of the who.
[01:47:35.226 --> 01:47:40.710]  These amendments that are coming up that are going to be voted on in 2024, the who, are frightening.
[01:47:40.710 --> 01:47:44.053]  And they really risk taking away all of our sovereignty.
[01:47:44.053 --> 01:47:47.275]  People have to awaken to the dangers of the moment.
[01:47:49.295 --> 01:47:58.037]  All right, let's play the great new American researcher and writer Alex Newman exposing the literal murderers that killed 20 million people so far with their shots.
[01:47:58.037 --> 01:47:59.998]  People say, why is Jones so crazed?
[01:47:59.998 --> 01:48:03.178]  Because I'm risking my life because I know how real it is.
[01:48:03.178 --> 01:48:05.019]  I am pained by this.
[01:48:05.019 --> 01:48:06.259]  I know they did it.
[01:48:06.259 --> 01:48:07.619]  I know it's expanding.
[01:48:07.619 --> 01:48:08.520]  I know their plan.
[01:48:08.520 --> 01:48:11.280]  I'll expose it tomorrow on the main show.
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:13.541]  That's a normal response.
[01:48:13.541 --> 01:48:14.081]  Be murdered.
[01:48:23.598 --> 01:48:34.660]  Joe Biden's White House put out an executive order last year saying that the administration puts the highest urgency on creating, deploying, and using a central bank digital currency.
[01:48:34.660 --> 01:48:36.721]  And of course, the Federal Reserve has been working on this.
[01:48:36.721 --> 01:48:40.601]  It's all being coordinated by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland.
[01:48:40.601 --> 01:48:43.042]  They've been working on this for years and years now.
[01:48:43.042 --> 01:48:43.662]  So the Fed now
[01:48:44.342 --> 01:48:44.883]  We're good to go.
[01:49:04.742 --> 01:49:16.570]  These currencies can be programmable, so that if you've already exceeded your carbon footprint, say, you won't be allowed to buy another steak, or buy an airplane ticket, or put gasoline in your car, or maybe even heat your home.
[01:49:16.570 --> 01:49:18.432]  It's hard to overstate the danger of this.
[01:49:18.432 --> 01:49:21.814]  I mean, this is the most Orwellian tool for tyranny.
[01:49:21.814 --> 01:49:33.042]  And then when you combine it with the digital IDs, when you combine it with the surveillance, with the artificial intelligence that is now being developed, you realize they're building actually a prison planet, and we are the prisoners.
[01:49:33.382 --> 01:49:35.084]  Yeah, we absolutely are.
[01:49:35.084 --> 01:49:38.787]  It's just so scary and I just, I can't even believe this is the world we're living in.
[01:49:38.787 --> 01:49:43.472]  But I'm so grateful that you're speaking out about this and so many others too, to spread awareness.
[01:49:43.472 --> 01:49:48.737]  But it's so true that the goal here, the total goal, is just complete control over every aspect of your life.
[01:49:48.737 --> 01:49:56.765]  You'll never be able to save money and your funds will be turned on and off based on your social credit score, which, as we all know, we're seeing the beginnings of right now.
[01:49:57.365 --> 01:50:04.052]  I mean, isn't the idea of the central bank digital currency hugely unpopular with the majority of Americans?
[01:50:04.052 --> 01:50:15.263]  And if people do resist this, do you think they can still push it through and force CBDCs to be implemented through maybe the destruction of blockchain solutions?
[01:50:17.088 --> 01:50:22.132]  Yeah, I mean, to be clear, there is no public support for this at all.
[01:50:22.132 --> 01:50:25.795]  How many people have you heard say, hey, I wish I had a central bank digital currency?
[01:50:25.795 --> 01:50:30.639]  It was a total non-issue for people, completely unpopular idea.
[01:50:30.639 --> 01:50:37.945]  And if people understood the implications, there would be not just no support for it, there would be maybe even an outright revolt.
[01:50:37.945 --> 01:50:38.145]  But
[01:50:38.926 --> 01:50:43.048]  What they hope to do is back us into a corner and force us to accept this.
[01:50:43.048 --> 01:50:50.792]  Again, eventually, I think they'll roll this out in parallel with cash, and after they get the bugs worked out, they'll start demonizing cash more and more.
[01:50:50.792 --> 01:50:58.576]  It's a tool for terrorists, it's a tool for white supremacists, it's a tool for tax cheats and drug dealers and pimps and things like this.
[01:50:58.576 --> 01:51:08.161]  In an effort to kind of stigmatize the use of cash, a lot can be done to resist this, and we must resist this, because again, once the door on this cage shuts,
[01:51:08.781 --> 01:51:10.002]  It's not going to be opened again.
[01:51:10.002 --> 01:51:11.884]  We have to stop it.
[01:51:11.884 --> 01:51:18.471]  We have to stop it.
[01:51:18.471 --> 01:51:23.636]  Let's play a clip from Tony Blair last week at the World Economic Forum, admitting this is all to control you.
[01:51:23.636 --> 01:51:25.097]  I like 15 clips.
[01:51:25.097 --> 01:51:26.618]  I said 10 clips, not 15 of these.
[01:51:26.618 --> 01:51:26.939]  Here it is.
[01:51:28.257 --> 01:51:33.500]  The technology and the digital infrastructure, I just want to emphasize how important I think that is.
[01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:41.465]  Because in the end, you need the data, you need to know who's been vaccinated and who hasn't been.
[01:51:41.465 --> 01:51:46.568]  Some of the vaccines that will come on down the line will be multiple shots.
[01:51:46.568 --> 01:51:53.072]  So you've got to have, for reasons to do with the healthcare more generally, but certainly for a pandemic or for
[01:51:54.373 --> 01:51:56.956]  For vaccines, you've got to have a proper digital infrastructure.
[01:51:56.956 --> 01:51:57.917]  That's the node for all the control.
[01:51:57.917 --> 01:51:58.998]  Many countries don't have that.
[01:51:58.998 --> 01:52:00.439]  In fact, most countries don't have that.
[01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:15.798]  Arden, the disgraced Prime Minister of New Zealand, now is the anti-free speech czar of the WEF.
[01:52:15.798 --> 01:52:19.261]  Listen to her about, oh, we love free speech, but we've got to control it.
[01:52:19.261 --> 01:52:21.864]  She lied about everything, said don't look at a sunset.
[01:52:21.864 --> 01:52:22.885]  Remember that?
[01:52:22.885 --> 01:52:23.906]  Don't talk to your neighbours.
[01:52:23.906 --> 01:52:27.749]  This is a monstrous meth-head witch, in my opinion.
[01:52:27.749 --> 01:52:28.170]  Here she is.
[01:52:29.295 --> 01:52:41.181]  This week we launched an initiative alongside companies and non-profits to help improve research and understanding of how a person's online experiences are curated by automated processes.
[01:52:41.181 --> 01:52:50.266]  This will also be important in understanding more about myths and disinformation online, a challenge that we must, as leaders, address.
[01:52:50.266 --> 01:52:53.267]  As leaders, we're rightly concerned... Back it up, back it up five seconds.
[01:52:53.267 --> 01:52:54.548]  This literal witch
[01:52:55.774 --> 01:52:58.636]  Is saying we need to understand misinformation, disinformation.
[01:52:58.636 --> 01:53:00.597]  She's the biggest liar ever.
[01:53:00.597 --> 01:53:02.839]  Continue.
[01:53:02.839 --> 01:53:10.704]  Nonprofits to help improve research and understanding of how a person's online experiences are curated by automated processes.
[01:53:12.093 --> 01:53:17.556]  This will also be important in understanding more about myths and disinformation online.
[01:53:17.556 --> 01:53:21.158]  A challenge that we must, as leaders, address.
[01:53:21.158 --> 01:53:34.486]  As leaders, we're rightly concerned that even the most light-touch approaches to disinformation could be misinterpreted as being hostile to the values of free speech that we value so highly.
[01:53:34.486 --> 01:53:35.947]  But while I cannot tell you today...
[01:53:37.073 --> 01:53:42.858]  Remember the clip of her saying, don't listen to any other information, the shots totally protect you, take them, they're great.
[01:53:42.858 --> 01:53:44.540]  The only true information she gets from us.
[01:53:44.540 --> 01:53:45.120]  Remember that clip?
[01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:49.884]  I mean, the woman is a literal demon joke.
[01:53:49.884 --> 01:53:56.030]  The protege of Klaus Schwab, he says she's the best woman, the best man is Justin Trudeau.
[01:53:56.030 --> 01:53:58.472]  I mean, just listen to this monster.
[01:54:00.543 --> 01:54:05.645]  I can say with complete certainty that we cannot ignore it.
[01:54:05.645 --> 01:54:10.507]  To do so poses an equal threat to the norms we all value.
[01:54:10.507 --> 01:54:13.088]  After all, how do you... Back it up ten seconds.
[01:54:13.088 --> 01:54:17.869]  The norms of murdering us with poison shots, open borders, GMO, 5G.
[01:54:17.869 --> 01:54:20.290]  I mean they're literally, you have nothing to lose.
[01:54:20.290 --> 01:54:21.371]  Here's what I want to say.
[01:54:21.371 --> 01:54:23.572]  You have nothing to lose but resistance.
[01:54:23.572 --> 01:54:25.272]  They're cutting your power off.
[01:54:25.272 --> 01:54:27.053]  They're brainwashing your children.
[01:54:27.053 --> 01:54:28.353]  Your borders are wide open.
[01:54:28.353 --> 01:54:29.814]  They are at war with you.
[01:54:31.351 --> 01:54:39.457]  And they put Governor Hochul and her up there, little weak women, because epigenetically, you see a woman, you think, mommy.
[01:54:39.457 --> 01:54:42.199]  You think, not threatening.
[01:54:42.199 --> 01:54:43.700]  It's a front, folks.
[01:54:43.700 --> 01:54:51.386]  These are spokespersons for cold-blooded killers who decided to write us all off.
[01:54:51.386 --> 01:54:56.150]  Well, I'm writing off Bill Gates, and I'm writing off Klaus Schwab, and I'm telling them right now.
[01:54:58.644 --> 01:55:00.546]  I know they don't care because they're psychotic murderers.
[01:55:00.546 --> 01:55:02.929]  They just love the satanic energy of killing people.
[01:55:02.929 --> 01:55:05.351]  You're never going to get away with it, scumbags.
[01:55:05.351 --> 01:55:07.173]  We know who you are.
[01:55:07.173 --> 01:55:08.294]  All your efforts have failed.
[01:55:08.294 --> 01:55:09.195]  Try your AI.
[01:55:09.195 --> 01:55:09.936]  We'll hit the streets.
[01:55:09.936 --> 01:55:10.877]  We're already doing it.
[01:55:10.877 --> 01:55:15.121]  And I just call the listeners to realize it isn't words when I say how important you are.
[01:55:15.121 --> 01:55:15.622]  It isn't
[01:55:16.182 --> 01:55:17.182]  Words.
[01:55:17.182 --> 01:55:18.643]  It's truth.
[01:55:18.643 --> 01:55:21.043]  You are the answer.
[01:55:21.043 --> 01:55:22.884]  You are the resistance.
[01:55:22.884 --> 01:55:26.225]  You are the answer to 1984 tyranny.
[01:55:26.225 --> 01:55:27.585]  You are 1776.
[01:55:27.585 --> 01:55:32.806]  And I've said it a thousand times and I'll say it again.
[01:55:32.806 --> 01:55:35.827]  I don't know how all this is going to end.
[01:55:35.827 --> 01:55:38.428]  But if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[01:55:38.428 --> 01:55:41.889]  This is a test of whose side you're on.
[01:55:41.889 --> 01:55:42.769]  Finish with that witch.
[01:55:44.138 --> 01:55:44.718]  That's enough of her.
[01:55:44.718 --> 01:55:48.842]  I'm going to end you with Waylon Jennings, Sunday Night Live, 6-8pm, coming up with a special guest.
[01:55:48.842 --> 01:55:49.562]  Here's Waylon Jennings.
[01:56:13.021 --> 01:56:20.606]  Just a good old boy, never meaning no harm.
[01:56:20.606 --> 01:56:27.590]  Beats all you never saw, been in trouble with the law since the day they was born.
[01:56:27.590 --> 01:56:34.614]  Straightening the curve, flattening the hills.
[01:56:34.614 --> 01:56:38.256]  Someday the mountain might get him, but the law never will.
[01:56:43.613 --> 01:56:51.004]  The only way to know how, stop following their laws, they're your enemy.
[01:56:51.004 --> 01:56:54.430]  The law's tyranny, resistance is the prerogative.
[01:57:13.442 --> 01:57:16.205]  Mike Adams coming up, Maria Z, St.
[01:57:16.205 --> 01:57:17.105]  Onge.
[01:57:17.105 --> 01:57:18.887]  It's a big night.
[01:57:18.887 --> 01:57:21.550]  Everybody, you know, tune in now.
[01:57:21.550 --> 01:57:25.573]  The only way they know how, but that's just a little bit more.
[01:57:25.573 --> 01:57:29.237]  When the law's deaf, we're against the law.
[01:57:29.237 --> 01:57:30.958]  You know, my mama loves me.
[01:57:49.125 --> 01:57:55.326]  If you ever take one piece of my advice, it's get a bottle of X2.
[01:57:55.326 --> 01:57:59.988]  It's been sold out for over a year because we wouldn't cut corners, and because it's so hard to produce.
[01:57:59.988 --> 01:58:04.369]  We finally have a limited run, back in supply, at infowarestore.com.
[01:58:05.809 --> 01:58:08.851]  So many people have serious issues.
[01:58:08.851 --> 01:58:10.431]  Look at the UN's own numbers.
[01:58:10.431 --> 01:58:16.374]  Billions have cognitive disabilities because they do not have true nascent iodine in their bodies.
[01:58:16.374 --> 01:58:22.417]  Most of the other iodine is bound to other heavy metals or bound to other elements so you don't download it.
[01:58:22.417 --> 01:58:25.159]  But this is pure atomic certified
[01:58:27.057 --> 01:58:28.277]  I don't know.
[01:58:48.664 --> 01:58:54.426]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing, high-quality coffee has not been available.
[01:58:54.426 --> 01:58:59.248]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:58:59.248 --> 01:59:02.289]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[01:59:02.289 --> 01:59:11.852]  But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran-owned and veteran-operated.
[01:59:11.852 --> 01:59:14.453]  It's powered by the company Minuteman Coffee.
[01:59:15.093 --> 01:59:23.642]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best-tasting, best-smelling, strongest coffee that I have ever drank.
[01:59:23.642 --> 01:59:25.484]  It is game-changing.
[01:59:25.484 --> 01:59:27.726]  All you gotta do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[01:59:27.726 --> 01:59:31.069]  I know you're gonna be hooked, which will then fund your Operation A360 win.

[01:59:35.113 --> 01:59:36.154]  That's the strongest.

[01:59:38.997 --> 01:59:46.500]  And finally, the best tasting dark roast tip of the spear, now exclusively available at InfoWarsTore.com.
