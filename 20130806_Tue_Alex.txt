[00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:09.789]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:11.370]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.911]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.911 --> 00:00:17.114]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.114 --> 00:00:21.176]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.893 --> 00:00:36.517]  The Global Crime Syndicate is attempting to chart our future, decide humanity's destiny.
[00:00:36.517 --> 00:00:42.181]  From my deep research, they are the worst possible group to be trying to control human destiny.
[00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:49.126]  In fact, anybody historically that tries to control human destiny by force creates an absolute nightmare.
[00:00:49.126 --> 00:00:54.509]  And with these globalists, it is their conscious plan to create a dystopian nightmare.
[00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:57.071]  They believe that they're creating an artificial survival
[00:00:58.502 --> 00:01:01.924]  Of the fittest social Darwinism for our own good.
[00:01:01.924 --> 00:01:04.605]  This is going to be another very important transmission.
[00:01:04.605 --> 00:01:11.468]  To say the least, Congressman, former Congressman Ron Paul is going to be popping in at the bottom of the hour.
[00:01:11.468 --> 00:01:17.732]  The former Secret Service agent who quit over the tyranny he saw in the federal government.
[00:01:17.732 --> 00:01:20.873]  Dan Bongino is going to be popping in as well.
[00:01:20.873 --> 00:01:26.256]  And Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs, who I talked and linked with last night and this morning,
[00:01:27.401 --> 00:01:30.622]  When he'd be joining us, it was very strange.
[00:01:30.622 --> 00:01:32.483]  I hadn't talked to him in a few weeks.
[00:01:32.483 --> 00:01:38.624]  Of course, friends with Michael Hastings, the mysteriously deceased, it's not too mysterious now, we know he's pretty much killed.
[00:01:38.624 --> 00:01:40.285]  The evidence all points there.
[00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:41.685]  Michael Hastings.
[00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:49.408]  So I just put my children to bed at about 9.30 and I sent him a text and I said, how are you doing?
[00:01:49.408 --> 00:01:52.409]  How is Hastings' wife doing?
[00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.330]  And he said, oh, are you texting me?
[00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.990]  Because, uh,
[00:01:56.923 --> 00:01:58.724]  CNN tonight?
[00:01:58.724 --> 00:02:05.026]  She's on CNN with Piers Morgan and seems incredibly happy.
[00:02:05.026 --> 00:02:08.907]  So I went this morning and watched it and it totally freaked me out.
[00:02:08.907 --> 00:02:16.169]  He said he's had reporters, you name it, Fox News calling him saying they thought it was very bizarre as well.
[00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:21.371]  Just smiling like she'd gone to the first Beatles concert when they came to the U.S.
[00:02:21.371 --> 00:02:24.012]  and the women's eyes are just starry-eyed.
[00:02:26.271 --> 00:02:32.314]  People do weird stuff when they're uncomfortable, but see, that's the problem.
[00:02:32.314 --> 00:02:34.236]  That's the problem.
[00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:52.206]  She told Staff Sergeant Hastings and other of his military friends, Hastings, Joe Biggs, that she was going to bring down whoever killed him at the memorial.
[00:02:54.272 --> 00:03:05.758]  And then when we were going to send reporters out there a few weeks ago, she called him up crying saying, please don't do it.
[00:03:05.758 --> 00:03:08.039]  And so we decided to give her a few weeks.
[00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:11.620]  She said, I've got an investigation going.
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.062]  I think you'll mess it up.
[00:03:15.062 --> 00:03:21.285]  And Staff Sergeant Biggs can't even bring himself right now to call her up.
[00:03:27.048 --> 00:03:35.730]  I don't know how much he's going to say when he gets on air with us, but there's a lot more to the story, too.
[00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.531]  And I tell you, it's really hard being a journalist, because I'm a political pundit.
[00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:41.392]  I do analysis.
[00:03:41.392 --> 00:03:41.932]  I rant.
[00:03:41.932 --> 00:03:43.072]  I rave.
[00:03:43.072 --> 00:03:45.853]  I guess it's entertaining sometimes as a train wreck.
[00:03:45.853 --> 00:03:55.275]  But the reason this broadcast is successful is that we've proven historically to be very accurate and to be able to predict what's happening far out from an unfolding.
[00:03:57.136 --> 00:03:58.256]  And because I'm real.
[00:03:58.256 --> 00:04:00.157]  People know that.
[00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:02.178]  And they pick up on that.
[00:04:02.178 --> 00:04:13.122]  But it is torture to be told things and then talk to other sources and confirm things that are just bombshell.
[00:04:13.122 --> 00:04:21.205]  And then to have to sit here on information because you've not been authorized to release it, that quite frankly is dangerous.
[00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:28.730]  But they killed him.
[00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.791]  You can bet your bottom dollar that.
[00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:34.553]  You can bet your boots.
[00:04:34.553 --> 00:04:41.397]  And we're going to be talking about that coming up.
[00:04:41.397 --> 00:04:44.379]  Whenever I'm speechless, folks, it's because I can't say what I know.
[00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:48.381]  Because I'm the type of guy that just goes with what they know.
[00:04:48.381 --> 00:04:50.922]  And when I know something and I can't say it,
[00:04:52.056 --> 00:04:54.442]  It's like having a frog in your throat.
[00:04:54.442 --> 00:04:55.083]  We'll be back.
[00:04:55.083 --> 00:04:56.908]  There's a lot more coming up.
[00:04:56.908 --> 00:04:57.349]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:08.485]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[00:05:08.485 --> 00:05:12.728]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[00:06:00.558 --> 00:06:05.221]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[00:06:05.221 --> 00:06:11.186]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[00:06:11.186 --> 00:06:13.107]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[00:06:13.107 --> 00:06:13.747]  It's food.

[00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:16.703]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[00:08:08.942 --> 00:08:20.969]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.969 --> 00:08:34.817]  What I know about the death of Rolling Stone journalist Michael Hastings has a lot of army rangers and regular army and special forces scared.
[00:08:34.817 --> 00:08:35.558]  Scared to talk.
[00:08:36.735 --> 00:08:45.419]  Looking out their windows at night, looking under their cars.
[00:08:45.419 --> 00:08:50.741]  It's one thing, I guess, to go to foreign lands and be engaged in combat because then the peer pressure says it's okay.
[00:08:50.741 --> 00:09:06.008]  It's another thing to watch your friend's car blown up and know that federal agency visited Hastings the day before it happened and that he told his friends via telephone and email and said they're coming after me and all that's come out
[00:09:08.058 --> 00:09:13.620]  And then Piers Morgan goes on TV last night and says it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:20.642]  And I want to cue that up to when he starts to go to the widow and then calls it a conspiracy theory.
[00:09:20.642 --> 00:09:22.183]  He says there's a lot of conspiracy theories.
[00:09:22.183 --> 00:09:23.963]  He was working on a big story.
[00:09:23.963 --> 00:09:35.047]  He said in an email, my biggest story ever, CIA, they're coming after me.
[00:09:35.047 --> 00:09:37.028]  They're going to raid our offices, get lawyers.
[00:09:37.978 --> 00:09:40.059]  And then his car blows up.
[00:09:40.059 --> 00:09:45.683]  And then now we have the surveillance footage of it going down the road, explosion, and then it goes off the road into the tree.
[00:09:45.683 --> 00:09:50.747]  And that's what all the witnesses have said, and the police tapes have come out.
[00:09:50.747 --> 00:09:54.890]  And what I know, I've told the radio listeners.
[00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.113]  And no mainstream media will pick it up, because they're controlled.
[00:09:59.113 --> 00:10:04.677]  None of them will touch it, except for some San Diego and LA TV stations, to their credit, but no national media.
[00:10:06.534 --> 00:10:09.776]  And his friends and family all know the feds were there.
[00:10:09.776 --> 00:10:16.481]  And that's why they're so scared, because they see the feds on the news saying, we never visited him.
[00:10:16.481 --> 00:10:20.923]  And then there's more about what Hastings said to friends and family.
[00:10:20.923 --> 00:10:27.528]  And quite frankly, people contact me with this info who are on record to be his friends and who are on record to get his last communications.
[00:10:27.528 --> 00:10:30.970]  And then they're like, yeah, but we, we can't go out public with this.
[00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:32.071]  It's too dangerous.
[00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:33.932]  What's dangerous is knowing this stuff.
[00:10:39.525 --> 00:10:47.507]  I'm going to play a clip from Piers Morgan, but let me just show you, if you're a TV viewer, radio listeners can pull this up on Infowars.com.
[00:10:47.507 --> 00:10:52.708]  Michael Hastings' wife says suspicious crash was tragic accident.
[00:10:52.708 --> 00:11:00.590]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:08.332]  Elise Jordan tells CNN that Rolling Stone journalist was on trail of hot story.
[00:11:10.876 --> 00:11:23.121]  So, to her credit, the known government operative, UK operative, globalist operative, Piers Morgan says it's a conspiracy that he was even working on a big story.
[00:11:23.121 --> 00:11:38.707]  But let's talk about her for a moment, because she told Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs and others at the memorial, crying that whoever did this was going to be brought down.
[00:11:40.134 --> 00:12:06.067]  Now, since then she's clearly been threatened, because hours after I had Biggs on the show two weeks ago, and I said I was going to fly him, and investigative journalist Wayne Madsen, who's an expert in investigating murder for higher top operations, and other reporters, InfoWars reporters, in fact, I was already pulling the trigger to go myself, he calls up and says,
[00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:15.328]  That afternoon, well, she called me up crying and then handed the phone to a friend saying, don't do it, don't do it, don't blow my investigation.
[00:12:15.328 --> 00:12:17.090]  Please just give me a few weeks.
[00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:22.434]  And then her friend said, please just go with her wishes.
[00:12:22.434 --> 00:12:30.541]  Now, let's talk about Alyse Jordan.
[00:12:30.541 --> 00:12:32.143]  Let's go to her biography right here.
[00:12:35.731 --> 00:12:43.172]  Catherine Elise Jordan, born in Holly Springs, Mississippi.
[00:12:43.172 --> 00:12:50.694]  Jordan served as the Director for Communications in the National Security Council from 08 to 09.
[00:12:50.694 --> 00:12:55.715]  That is the shadow real government that runs the entire enchilada.
[00:12:55.715 --> 00:13:03.576]  You can go to the bibliography there, where it links directly through to the Atlantic Wire and the White House and AP about her bio.
[00:13:04.517 --> 00:13:04.958]  Okay?
[00:13:04.958 --> 00:13:05.899]  AP.
[00:13:05.899 --> 00:13:07.320]  White House.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.602]  That's a fact.
[00:13:08.602 --> 00:13:12.627]  That she was the Director of Communications, or PSYOPs, for...
[00:13:15.578 --> 00:13:19.260]  The White House Office of Presidential Speechwriting, and the U.S.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:31.328]  Embassy Baghdad, and for the Commanding General Strategic Advisory Group at the International Security Assistance Force, headquarters in Kabul, Afghanistan, as well as speechwriter for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
[00:13:31.328 --> 00:13:40.334]  She also served as Director of Communications of the Naval Security Council before marrying Michael Hastings, May 21st, 2011, in Mississippi.
[00:13:46.172 --> 00:13:51.334]  Two years later, Mr. Hastings is dead.
[00:13:51.334 --> 00:13:56.635]  Now, she's got some explaining to do and I understand she's a widow and our heart goes out to her.
[00:13:56.635 --> 00:14:01.117]  She had a child with Mr. Hastings.
[00:14:01.117 --> 00:14:07.039]  But she knows the feds came to the house and they're lying.
[00:14:07.039 --> 00:14:13.341]  And she knows that Hastings was working on a big story and that his car blew up.
[00:14:14.821 --> 00:14:19.045]  That's what the witnesses are now on record with the 9-11 tapes, confirming what other witnesses said.
[00:14:19.045 --> 00:14:22.789]  It's going down the road, it blows up in the middle of the street, then goes off the road into a tree.
[00:14:22.789 --> 00:14:24.531]  That's what the surveillance footage shows.
[00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:25.231]  Boom!
[00:14:25.231 --> 00:14:27.374]  An explosion underneath the car.
[00:14:27.374 --> 00:14:31.077]  That's why the engine went blowing out the back, the opposite direction.
[00:14:31.077 --> 00:14:34.401]  Because it's under the car.
[00:14:34.401 --> 00:14:35.662]  Probably in front of the engine.
[00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.411]  Ladies and gentlemen, I don't like having to report on stuff, but it's my duty.
[00:14:42.411 --> 00:14:53.534]  You understand, it's almost like slavery that I can't be an egomaniac and I can't be into just enjoying myself and being a narcissist and a nihilist and going and having fun.
[00:14:53.534 --> 00:14:55.795]  I would love to go scuba diving in the Caribbean.
[00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:58.215]  I would love to go to the Smoky Mountains again.
[00:14:58.215 --> 00:14:59.836]  I would love to go to Colorado.
[00:14:59.836 --> 00:15:03.797]  I would love to go see really cool, neat people I know all over the world.
[00:15:03.797 --> 00:15:07.398]  I would love to take the offers, you know, to fly by private jet to
[00:15:08.158 --> 00:15:10.079]  The South of France.
[00:15:10.079 --> 00:15:12.620]  I can't do it because I've got too many responsibilities.
[00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.001]  I'm not up here saying I'm some goody-two-shoes.
[00:15:15.001 --> 00:15:16.441]  Oh, aren't I great?
[00:15:16.441 --> 00:15:20.583]  But I am risking my life bringing you this information because somebody's got to do it.
[00:15:20.583 --> 00:15:23.864]  And my instinct is to tell the truth and stand up against this.
[00:15:26.002 --> 00:15:29.924]  I just can't sit here and bow in fear like everybody else does.
[00:15:29.924 --> 00:15:34.266]  That's why I just admire Staff Sergeant Joseph Piggs.
[00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:42.829]  Because the other Army people he knows that were even better friends with Hastings than he, they know all of it, folks.
[00:15:42.829 --> 00:15:49.092]  And they know what Hastings said before he died.
[00:15:49.092 --> 00:15:54.234]  And, you know, I've just gotten to the point of why am I even told this stuff and then I can't tell people about it.
[00:15:56.405 --> 00:16:00.286]  I've already told over 10 reporters about this.
[00:16:00.286 --> 00:16:01.687]  And they, by the way, already know.
[00:16:01.687 --> 00:16:03.367]  It's an open secret.
[00:16:03.367 --> 00:16:10.429]  And I just can't believe... Oh, he's been on... Some of my contacts have been on the phone with Fox News.
[00:16:10.429 --> 00:16:11.670]  It's called him and others today.
[00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:16.651]  Everybody knows that the boat is sinking.
[00:16:16.651 --> 00:16:19.812]  Everybody knows the captain lied.
[00:16:19.812 --> 00:16:23.933]  Everybody knows the war is over.
[00:16:23.933 --> 00:16:25.514]  Everybody knows the good guy is lost.
[00:16:29.724 --> 00:16:37.338]  And then now the long winter sets in of slavery, where now the criminals go, yeah, we're spying on everything you do.
[00:16:37.338 --> 00:16:39.662]  Yeah, we're spying on petty crime with the NSA.
[00:16:39.662 --> 00:16:40.404]  Yeah, we're watching.
[00:16:40.404 --> 00:16:42.307]  Yeah, we're going to take your kids whenever we want for no reason.
[00:16:43.308 --> 00:16:45.009]  Yeah, we're going to put poison in the water.
[00:16:45.009 --> 00:16:49.351]  It came out in the news that, oh, Gardasil sterilizes women.
[00:16:49.351 --> 00:16:53.833]  Who would have thought something being pushed by Bill Gates would sterilize women?
[00:16:53.833 --> 00:16:59.475]  Really, who would have thought they want it for 11 and 12-year-old girls that are about to go into puberty?
[00:16:59.475 --> 00:17:04.617]  I mean, who would have thought?
[00:17:04.617 --> 00:17:07.219]  We're just going to let them do that to us?
[00:17:07.219 --> 00:17:10.380]  I'm not going to sit here and take this stuff, okay?
[00:17:13.117 --> 00:17:18.361]  Where are the men in this country?
[00:17:18.361 --> 00:17:20.523]  Everybody is so scared.
[00:17:20.523 --> 00:17:21.783]  Well, I'm scared of being scared.
[00:17:21.783 --> 00:17:23.064]  I'm scared of living in fear.
[00:17:23.064 --> 00:17:34.333]  Let's go to this really creepy, disconcerting, unnerving, that's the word being used by the media behind the scenes, with the creepy British intel guy, Piers Morgan.
[00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:35.474]  You know why I blew up at Piers Morgan?
[00:17:35.474 --> 00:17:36.995]  Because I was disgusted by him.
[00:17:36.995 --> 00:17:38.035]  My skin crawled.
[00:17:38.035 --> 00:17:39.777]  He looked like a vampire in person, folks.
[00:17:41.192 --> 00:17:43.473]  You look dead, like a reanimated corpse.
[00:17:43.473 --> 00:17:44.754]  Well, I'm not dead!
[00:17:44.754 --> 00:17:46.135]  I'm not dead yet!
[00:17:46.135 --> 00:17:49.476]  I'm alive, and I'm not backing down!
[00:17:49.476 --> 00:17:51.457]  My ancestors didn't, and I'm not.
[00:17:51.457 --> 00:17:55.980]  And civilization is built on men standing up to gangs and thugs.
[00:17:55.980 --> 00:18:04.884]  Civilization should be built on ingenuity and ideas and what you bring to the table, not being a bunch of armed thugs feeding on populations.
[00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:07.766]  I will not consign my family to slavery.
[00:18:07.766 --> 00:18:09.367]  I will not sell out to evil.
[00:18:10.452 --> 00:18:11.373]  Let's go to this clip.
[00:18:11.373 --> 00:18:12.173]  Here's part of it.
[00:18:26.795 --> 00:18:27.875]  Just taking it day by day.
[00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:30.916]  I was blessed to have the time with him that I had.
[00:18:30.916 --> 00:18:32.716]  So, I feel very lucky for that.
[00:18:32.716 --> 00:18:34.997]  And, you know, just taking it day by day.
[00:18:34.997 --> 00:18:36.337]  She looks genuinely really happy.
[00:18:36.337 --> 00:18:42.879]  As there always are in these situations, wild conspiracy theories that he was chasing some hot story.
[00:18:42.879 --> 00:18:46.880]  Maybe connected to that is his late night car crash in Los Angeles.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.600]  Other theories too.
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:48.400]  Look at the look in her eyes.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.600]  Do you subscribe to any of this?
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.121]  Do you have any idea really what may have happened?
[00:18:51.121 --> 00:18:54.241]  You know, I have no doubt that he was pursuing a hot story.
[00:18:54.241 --> 00:18:56.362]  He always had at least five hot stories.
[00:18:56.522 --> 00:18:57.503]  I work for the Seattle government.
[00:18:57.503 --> 00:18:58.764]  You're seeing the video of this, folks.
[00:18:58.764 --> 00:19:00.286]  She looks like she just won the lottery.
[00:19:20.164 --> 00:19:21.964]  He was a real one-off.
[00:19:21.964 --> 00:19:24.025]  That's enough.
[00:19:24.025 --> 00:19:24.785]  It goes on and on.
[00:19:24.785 --> 00:19:29.586]  So the car is driving down the road and all the witnesses say it blows up and then into the air and into a tree.
[00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:33.687]  And now we have video of it driving along and a big explosion in the middle of the street.
[00:19:33.687 --> 00:19:39.748]  Just like all the witnesses said, now the 9-1-1 tapes are released, which the feds fought to stop.
[00:19:39.748 --> 00:19:43.569]  And she told people at the memorial, I'm going to take down who did this.
[00:19:43.569 --> 00:19:47.330]  So maybe she's putting a big act on so they think she's going to shut up.
[00:19:47.330 --> 00:19:49.390]  Undoubtedly, she's bare minimum been threatened.
[00:19:51.770 --> 00:19:56.760]  Remember folks, she worked for the highest levels of the real government in this country.
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.723]  This is so creepy.
[00:20:00.563 --> 00:20:03.165]  There may be a hidden danger lurking in our homes.
[00:20:03.165 --> 00:20:05.746]  And without the right equipment, you'll never know it's there.
[00:20:05.746 --> 00:20:11.530]  Maser instruments detect all forms of nuclear radiation, including alpha, beta, gamma, and x-rays.
[00:20:11.530 --> 00:20:12.751]  And are always on.
[00:20:12.751 --> 00:20:13.972]  Just like your smoke alarm.
[00:20:13.972 --> 00:20:16.873]  Detecting, measuring, and monitoring nuclear radiation.
[00:20:16.873 --> 00:20:17.874]  Made in America.
[00:20:17.874 --> 00:20:18.915]  Laboratory grade.
[00:20:18.915 --> 00:20:20.196]  And EMP resistant.
[00:20:20.196 --> 00:20:24.218]  If you can't reliably measure nuclear radiation, you're not fully prepared.
[00:20:24.218 --> 00:20:25.579]  But now you can be.
[00:20:25.579 --> 00:20:27.320]  At Maser Instruments dot com.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.822]  Spelled M-A-Z-U-R Instruments dot com.
[00:20:30.629 --> 00:20:39.931]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it lent back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:40.731]  This capitalism?
[00:20:40.731 --> 00:20:46.893]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:20:46.893 --> 00:20:50.594]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[00:20:50.594 --> 00:20:51.534]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:20:51.534 --> 00:20:52.914]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:20:53.234 --> 00:20:53.514]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.416 --> 00:21:05.078]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[00:21:05.078 --> 00:21:11.041]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[00:21:11.041 --> 00:21:12.962]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[00:21:12.962 --> 00:21:13.602]  It's food.
[00:21:13.602 --> 00:21:20.546]  Having a supply of eFoodsDirect 25-year shelf-life food is your best investment for the troubled times today and the future.

[00:23:00.166 --> 00:23:05.532]  There are those curious about bitcoins and those using and making money with bitcoins.
[00:23:05.532 --> 00:23:07.174]  What are bitcoins?
[00:23:07.174 --> 00:23:13.660]  A bitcoin is the first decentralized currency that can be easily transferred from person to person over the internet.
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.062]  No bank needed.
[00:23:15.462 --> 00:23:21.148]  This means lower fees and accounts can never be frozen, limited or closed.
[00:23:21.148 --> 00:23:23.431]  You are in control of your money.
[00:23:23.431 --> 00:23:24.592]  And the best part?
[00:23:24.592 --> 00:23:28.216]  You can start earning and making money with Bitcoins right away.

[00:23:57.673 --> 00:23:59.154]  We mine your business.
[00:24:04.505 --> 00:24:25.718]  I am a Midwest farmer I make a living off the land
[00:24:35.843 --> 00:24:38.783]  You know what happens when good men do nothing, evil takes over.
[00:24:38.783 --> 00:24:42.604]  Thomas Jefferson said that.
[00:24:42.604 --> 00:24:43.624]  And it's true.
[00:24:43.624 --> 00:24:48.325]  Later in the broadcast, a story we put out yesterday has been picked up by the Daily Mail.
[00:24:48.325 --> 00:24:55.126]  Foster mother beats toddler to death after she was taken from biological parents because social services discovered them smoking pot.
[00:24:56.249 --> 00:25:00.233]  And it talked to neighbors and family and said, oh yeah, sometimes the dad smokes pot.
[00:25:00.233 --> 00:25:02.276]  And so now the little girl's dead.
[00:25:02.276 --> 00:25:07.541]  And a minority of people on the YouTube video I shot about this last night that's up on Infowars.com.
[00:25:07.541 --> 00:25:09.443]  And I've tracked back some of their handles and names.
[00:25:09.443 --> 00:25:11.245]  They're actually cops in Williamson County.
[00:25:12.166 --> 00:25:13.408]  Uh, they don't even hide that fact.
[00:25:13.408 --> 00:25:15.150]  You know, say, hey, you shouldn't be smoking pot.
[00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:16.152]  It's the law.
[00:25:16.152 --> 00:25:20.137]  So, look, I know you gotta say that so you feel like you're not part of this evil system.
[00:25:20.137 --> 00:25:22.700]  The government ships in the drugs, the hard drugs.
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.026]  On record, they try to put kids on hard drugs in the schools, the pharmacological drugs.
[00:25:28.511 --> 00:25:32.774]  The truth is, our government has more people in prison than any other government in history.
[00:25:32.774 --> 00:25:36.836]  The truth is, our government grabs more children a year than any other government's ever done.
[00:25:36.836 --> 00:25:38.437]  The truth is, it's a giant racket.
[00:25:38.437 --> 00:25:47.243]  And we're going to have a special report on that after Ron Paul leaves us at the end of this hour, or around the time it may be towards the next hour.
[00:25:47.243 --> 00:25:49.705]  Getting back to Michael Hastings, I want to explain something here.
[00:25:50.373 --> 00:25:52.333]  The Feds did visit him a day before.
[00:25:52.333 --> 00:25:58.335]  He did put out an email to about 20 of his closest friends saying, hey, if anything happens to me, they're coming after me.
[00:25:58.335 --> 00:26:01.536]  I'm going into hiding under the radar to release a big story.
[00:26:01.536 --> 00:26:03.296]  They're probably going to raid different offices.
[00:26:03.296 --> 00:26:03.836]  Be ready.
[00:26:03.836 --> 00:26:05.237]  Get lawyers.
[00:26:05.237 --> 00:26:07.497]  That's all public.
[00:26:07.497 --> 00:26:11.518]  First, they called it a conspiracy theory the first few days when we told you.
[00:26:11.518 --> 00:26:15.499]  OK, now I've talked to his friends and others off record.
[00:26:15.499 --> 00:26:19.660]  Only Biggs, Staff Sergeant Biggs, is willing to go on the record.
[00:26:21.016 --> 00:26:23.358]  And he talks to other people that were at the funeral, the memorial.
[00:26:23.358 --> 00:26:26.140]  They're all scared.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:27.341]  And obviously they know why.
[00:26:27.341 --> 00:26:33.766]  They see the FBI on the news saying no feds visited Hastings and they know that's not true.
[00:26:33.766 --> 00:26:38.789]  Some of these people talked to Hastings that day and he said they're coming after me.
[00:26:38.789 --> 00:26:40.070]  And then I go, well, you got to go on record.
[00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:42.532]  And they're like, man, I'm scared.
[00:26:42.532 --> 00:26:43.353]  I got a family.
[00:26:43.353 --> 00:26:44.754]  These people kill whoever they want.
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:50.147]  Now look, the bigger issue here is anybody with a brain knows they killed Hastings.
[00:26:50.147 --> 00:26:51.549]  Now we have the video.
[00:26:51.549 --> 00:26:59.921]  The wife goes to the memorial and says in front of a bunch of his military buddies, crying, I'm going to bring down whoever did this.
[00:27:01.263 --> 00:27:03.144]  And she believed he'd been killed.
[00:27:03.144 --> 00:27:07.087]  She goes on Piers Morgan looking like she was trying to win Miss America.
[00:27:07.087 --> 00:27:10.009]  You know, just radiating charm, totally happy.
[00:27:10.009 --> 00:27:14.151]  You know, oh yeah, this is great.
[00:27:14.151 --> 00:27:16.033]  Yeah, the conspiracy theorist.
[00:27:16.033 --> 00:27:18.114]  A 180, folks.
[00:27:18.114 --> 00:27:28.200]  So if this charming beauty queen wife is an actress, she deserves Oscars.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:28.661]  I mean, I...
[00:27:29.525 --> 00:27:30.765]  I just don't know what to say.
[00:27:30.765 --> 00:27:33.246]  Was it acting when she cried and said I'll bring these people down?
[00:27:33.246 --> 00:27:34.287]  Or was this acting?
[00:27:34.287 --> 00:27:39.689]  All I know is something stinks under the floorboards.
[00:27:39.689 --> 00:27:42.310]  God help us is all I can say at this point.
[00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:46.311]  This is the type of thing that really freaks me out and makes me hate my job.
[00:27:46.311 --> 00:27:51.153]  Because honor dictates I tell the truth and I go out and I expose this.
[00:27:51.153 --> 00:27:54.794]  And where it leads is really, really shakes my confidence in humanity.
[00:27:57.674 --> 00:28:02.296]  I mean, my God, if we'll sell out our own families, ladies and gentlemen, we'll sell anybody out.
[00:28:02.296 --> 00:28:06.258]  That's one thing these contractors brag, you know, they'll kill their own mother if they're told to do it.
[00:28:06.258 --> 00:28:08.419]  Oh, that's real manly.
[00:28:08.419 --> 00:28:09.160]  That's real tough.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.560]  You'll kill kids if you're ordered to.
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.942]  That's real tough.
[00:28:12.942 --> 00:28:18.144]  Now, the truth is you're a bunch of gang member cowards that do whatever you're told.
[00:28:18.144 --> 00:28:19.505]  And it's really shameful.
[00:28:19.505 --> 00:28:21.406]  This is the stuff that North Korea is made of.
[00:28:22.529 --> 00:28:29.051]  Sergeant Big standing up and telling the truth is the stuff that America and freedom and everything good is made of.
[00:28:29.051 --> 00:28:33.912]  So we're going to be continuing to scan all this and we're getting to the point where it's all come out now.
[00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:37.653]  The footage, what happened, the witnesses, they blew his car up.
[00:28:37.653 --> 00:28:40.213]  No need to even go out to California.
[00:28:40.213 --> 00:28:41.514]  And I guess the system doesn't care now.
[00:28:41.514 --> 00:28:45.735]  They just want you to know, we'll kill whoever we want, whenever we want.
[00:28:45.735 --> 00:28:46.235]  End of story.
[00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:53.496]  And it's just an open secret, and all the reporters I talk to know it, and know what I know, and it's like, yeah, everybody's scared.
[00:28:53.496 --> 00:28:55.719]  So we're a nation of cowards.
[00:28:55.719 --> 00:28:57.741]  Well, my listeners aren't cowards, and I'm not a coward.
[00:28:57.741 --> 00:28:59.142]  We're taking action against this evil.

[00:33:23.715 --> 00:33:25.396]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:33:37.472 --> 00:33:50.603]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are joined live with former congressman Dr. Ron Paul, really the grandfather of the modern liberty movement here in the United States and worldwide.
[00:33:50.603 --> 00:34:01.373]  Worldwide, across the planet, from Asia to Europe, from Africa to Latin America to here in North America, people look to Ron Paul as the answer to the collectivist Borg, and they are
[00:34:01.793 --> 00:34:02.033]  Let's go
[00:34:31.936 --> 00:34:38.059]  Ron Paul, myself and others have talked about for decades and that we were ridiculed for why it's all mainstream news now.
[00:34:38.059 --> 00:34:39.920]  So, do we get any credit?
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:42.682]  No, we get attacked even more.
[00:34:42.682 --> 00:34:44.583]  Dr. Paul, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:45.944]  Good to be with you again.
[00:34:45.944 --> 00:34:47.224]  Wow, so much is happening.
[00:34:47.224 --> 00:34:51.046]  First and foremost, you told them so again on foreign policy.
[00:34:51.046 --> 00:34:51.727]  What's happening there?
[00:34:52.824 --> 00:34:55.186]  Well, same old things, only worse.
[00:34:55.186 --> 00:35:03.634]  You know, the whole idea that we continue to finance our enemies and our friends and then our friends become our enemy and nobody knows whose side they're on.
[00:35:03.634 --> 00:35:09.640]  That's why the argument for a non-interventionist foreign policy is so good, because there's always this flip-flopping.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.102]  We support dictators.
[00:35:11.622 --> 00:35:19.604]  For years and years and spend billions of dollars and then of course when we get tired of them or they turn on us then we look for a new dictator.
[00:35:19.604 --> 00:35:22.765]  You know this craziness in Egypt.
[00:35:22.765 --> 00:35:31.607]  We demand that they have an election and they elect somebody we don't like so then we have to send the weapons to the military and then they have a military coup.
[00:35:31.607 --> 00:35:40.570]  So it goes on and on and right now of course one of the big issues is whether or not we'll get the bottom of the truth on Benghazi.
[00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:50.012]  But it shouldn't take too much of intelligence to figure out that our CIA is just about every place in the world, and they were very much involved.
[00:35:50.012 --> 00:36:02.035]  But if we have the direct evidence that they were in Benghazi, and one of the reasons our ambassador was there was because he was sending weapons directly to a group of people that we wanted to throw over Assad in Syria.
[00:36:03.175 --> 00:36:06.337]  But the foolishness is that we send it to Al-Qaeda.
[00:36:06.337 --> 00:36:09.399]  You know, at one time they're our archenemy.
[00:36:09.399 --> 00:36:15.243]  They're wanting to kill us, but then we turn around and we've done that in Afghanistan.
[00:36:15.243 --> 00:36:25.549]  We've sent money to the Taliban and sort of bribed them to give us protection and then we get our weapons through and then they go and fight and kill each other.
[00:36:25.549 --> 00:36:28.631]  So I think it's ongoing.
[00:36:28.631 --> 00:36:29.932]  It's very foolish and it's really
[00:36:34.659 --> 00:36:50.756]  Well, it's almost like a snake eating its tail, because Janet Napolitano, outgoing head of Homeland Security, says four years ago, oh, the new threats, gun owners, libertarians, conservatives, anti-war people, basically anybody with a political view outside of Washington orthodoxy,
[00:36:51.597 --> 00:37:09.463]  And that's the new threat, and then they say Al-Qaeda's not the threat, they're helping us in Libya and Syria, then they say, oh, we've got to shut down all the embassies, and even the New York Times today admits that basically they put out these terror alerts to distract from the NSA news.
[00:37:09.463 --> 00:37:11.503]  That is simply amazing.
[00:37:11.503 --> 00:37:18.886]  How long can this disjointed, helter-skelter narrative continue to work, or is it not working now?
[00:37:19.753 --> 00:37:22.494]  It's not amazing that this is the truth.
[00:37:22.494 --> 00:37:23.234]  It's amazing.
[00:37:23.234 --> 00:37:25.775]  I think the New York Times would admit it.
[00:37:25.775 --> 00:37:32.898]  But, you know, I think most of us, when we saw that and all, the NSA was on the fence that they were closing its embassies.
[00:37:32.898 --> 00:37:35.479]  They say, well, there were 50 tax plans.
[00:37:35.479 --> 00:37:36.279]  We just saved it.
[00:37:36.779 --> 00:37:43.504]  You know, save the country from it to prove that they're souping and all this spying on Americans does them good.
[00:37:43.504 --> 00:37:45.986]  But you know, they claim successes.
[00:37:45.986 --> 00:37:47.648]  They're all built on lies.
[00:37:47.648 --> 00:37:57.235]  And you heard the story where the testimony was that, yes, there were 54 saves that they prevented from happening.
[00:37:57.235 --> 00:38:01.018]  And then when they talked to the assistant
[00:38:03.239 --> 00:38:04.721]  And I think this is probably
[00:38:13.954 --> 00:38:26.407]  A benefit to it is that most Americans now are becoming very, very leery of what our government tells us, and it's a terrible thing to have to go through because who wants to give up on their country?
[00:38:26.407 --> 00:38:32.754]  We don't want to give up on our country, but I think it's high time we gave up on a lot of our politicians and the way our government's being run.
[00:38:34.005 --> 00:38:37.050]  Again, former Congressman Ron Paul joins us here today.
[00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:43.760]  What do you make of the head of National Intelligence, Clapper, saying to Congress,
[00:38:45.552 --> 00:38:50.315]  I'm going to play a few of those clips in a moment, but I'm sure you saw those in the last few weeks.
[00:38:50.315 --> 00:38:51.556]  What do you make of this?
[00:39:11.781 --> 00:39:17.102]  I try to understand it first, and I don't think it's a moral issue for them.
[00:39:17.102 --> 00:39:25.404]  If it becomes a moral issue, they reverse things and say they are morally responsible for taking care of you and being to protect us.
[00:39:25.404 --> 00:39:30.005]  They don't understand that their moral responsibility is to provide and protect our liberties.
[00:39:30.005 --> 00:39:33.926]  But they actually brainwash themselves into believing
[00:39:34.386 --> 00:39:34.546]  Sure.
[00:39:34.546 --> 00:39:34.626]  Sure.
[00:39:55.831 --> 00:40:00.494]  They believe themselves that this is true, so they are lying.
[00:40:00.494 --> 00:40:08.279]  And the other reason I think you can expect these lies is when you have tyranny, it's based on lies.
[00:40:08.279 --> 00:40:11.941]  If you have truth-tellers, it challenges the empire.
[00:40:11.941 --> 00:40:15.643]  And that is why they come down very, very hard on a whistleblower.
[00:40:15.643 --> 00:40:22.888]  They have to really make examples of them, even if what they have revealed has done no harm other than tell the American people
[00:40:23.288 --> 00:40:30.252]  And then they turn around and say, well, you know, we've got to punish him because they've turned his information over to our enemies.
[00:40:30.252 --> 00:40:36.116]  Well, you know, Snowden and Manning turned the information over to the American people.
[00:40:36.116 --> 00:40:42.039]  So I guess there's some people in our government that think we're the enemy and not some other country.
[00:40:42.399 --> 00:40:42.959]  Absolutely.
[00:40:42.959 --> 00:41:02.983]  I mean, if people claim they're Americans, constitutionalists, and that they support our system that's been proven to be the best one out there historically, hands down, then you know that tyrants try to spy on you in the name of your security, but it always ends up turning into an oppressive tyranny, generally by design, but it always, regardless, even with good intentions, goes bad.
[00:41:02.983 --> 00:41:04.263]  And then now they turn it around.
[00:41:04.263 --> 00:41:06.004]  We've got to violate your rights.
[00:41:06.004 --> 00:41:08.264]  Our responsibility, you know, is to take
[00:41:08.724 --> 00:41:18.689]  Uh, your freedoms away and how dare you try to keep us from protecting you and then an incredibly transparent, uh, you know, fake terror alert.
[00:41:18.689 --> 00:41:24.252]  Even Governor Ridge admitted in his book a few years ago that under Bush they would issue fake terror alerts.
[00:41:24.252 --> 00:41:31.436]  In case listeners didn't hear this, here's Clapper and then Alexander, his counterpart, saying they don't spy on the American people.
[00:41:31.436 --> 00:41:31.736]  Here it is.
[00:41:33.141 --> 00:41:35.803]  Give me a yes or no answer to the question.
[00:41:35.803 --> 00:41:44.788]  Does the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[00:41:44.788 --> 00:41:46.689]  No, sir.
[00:41:46.689 --> 00:41:49.150]  It does not?
[00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:51.251]  Not with it.
[00:41:51.251 --> 00:41:52.552]  Catherine Harris, Fox News Channel.
[00:41:52.552 --> 00:41:53.933]  Thanks for taking my question.
[00:41:53.933 --> 00:42:00.757]  Will the Utah Data Center hold the data of American citizens?
[00:42:00.757 --> 00:42:00.957]  No.
[00:42:01.963 --> 00:42:03.704]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:42:03.704 --> 00:42:05.345]  Going back to Ron Paul.
[00:42:05.345 --> 00:42:07.707]  Doctor, I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:42:07.707 --> 00:42:11.249]  Did you watch them on TV when they were saying that?
[00:42:11.249 --> 00:42:18.675]  You know, you don't have to be an expert psychiatrist to look at them and look at their faces and their eyes.
[00:42:18.675 --> 00:42:21.016]  You could tell they were lying through their teeth.
[00:42:21.016 --> 00:42:25.699]  It looks like when my children, they don't do it much, but I've caught them lying about stealing cookies.
[00:42:25.699 --> 00:42:29.442]  It looks exactly like when my daughters eat all the cookies and lie about it.
[00:42:29.662 --> 00:42:36.531]  Yeah, I think that they knew darn well, but once again, lying for them, if you can get away with it.
[00:42:36.531 --> 00:42:39.414]  I guess they've gone away with it for so long.
[00:42:39.414 --> 00:42:41.957]  Just think of how many wars have been fought over lies.
[00:42:41.957 --> 00:42:43.880]  You know, how they maneuver us into war.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:45.702]  WMDs, all of them.
[00:42:45.742 --> 00:43:00.212]  And so if they can do that and lose no sleep over it, you know, telling a little lie here and there about how much spying they're doing, they probably consider these minor lies compared to what we've been told in the past.
[00:43:02.774 --> 00:43:07.098]  Congressman, I want to shift gears into your son because it's a big national issue.
[00:43:07.098 --> 00:43:15.705]  I've got to say that he just continues to impress everybody in the Liberty Movement that he so deftly handles all these attacks.
[00:43:15.705 --> 00:43:19.508]  He has Joe Biden coming out against him in private meetings saying he's got to be dealt with.
[00:43:19.508 --> 00:43:21.390]  He's got Chris Christie coming out.
[00:43:21.390 --> 00:43:23.852]  He's got the President coming out against him.
[00:43:23.852 --> 00:43:25.693]  Karl Rove coming out against him.
[00:43:25.693 --> 00:43:29.637]  When the entire establishment is lining up against somebody, you know they're good.
[00:43:30.097 --> 00:43:41.500]  And the way he's really trying to defund the foreign bribery, the foreign aid, the way he's standing up against drones, I tell you, what is your take on them all lining up to shoot down Rand Paul?
[00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:44.861]  Well, it's a pretty good indication that he's probably on the right track.
[00:43:44.861 --> 00:43:56.244]  You know, when all the bad guys gang up on you, it sorts it all out because, you know, there's a few Republicans that do it too, and a lot of Democrats.
[00:43:56.684 --> 00:44:00.985]  But the leadership of both parties can't stand any of us.
[00:44:00.985 --> 00:44:04.825]  Because they are but one party, they pretend there's a great deal of difference.
[00:44:04.825 --> 00:44:19.548]  But if we reveal the truth, how many in the establishment, Republican or Democrat, would even consider anything we say about giving Bradley Manning a fair trial or Snowden a fair shake?
[00:44:19.548 --> 00:44:20.648]  They're not going to do it.
[00:44:24.429 --> 00:44:31.357]  People are beginning to realize, because the information is getting out, you know, a little bit differently now than it used to get out.
[00:44:31.357 --> 00:44:34.581]  We got 100% of our news from the three majors.
[00:44:34.581 --> 00:44:35.602]  That doesn't happen anymore.
[00:44:36.713 --> 00:44:38.154]  I've only got a few minutes left with you.
[00:44:38.154 --> 00:44:40.156]  Again, former Congressman Ron Paul joins us.
[00:44:40.156 --> 00:44:43.019]  I want to talk about the big announcement you're going to make here on the show.
[00:44:43.019 --> 00:44:44.980]  I guess a day early, we're honored.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:45:03.937]  But first off, looking at the future here, as you said, there's new media, there's alternative media, the numbers show in the aggregate we're bigger than the old media, the state-run media, DrugsReport.com, Infowars.com, the constellation of sites that Ron Paul, who's joining us, has.
[00:45:04.497 --> 00:45:06.800]  I mean, overall, they've got metrics out there.
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.221]  We're now bigger than they are.
[00:45:08.221 --> 00:45:18.572]  But they can still unify and kind of regurgitate the same news, and then sometimes we even kind of get caught up in debating whatever talking point they've put out.
[00:45:18.572 --> 00:45:22.476]  But short-term, mid-term, long-term, what do you see in your historical
[00:45:23.337 --> 00:45:25.579]  Crystal Ball looking forward.
[00:45:25.579 --> 00:45:28.342]  How do you think this is going to go for the establishment?
[00:45:28.342 --> 00:45:29.964]  Because they are losing the people.
[00:45:29.964 --> 00:45:35.349]  Just last week the Pentagon came out and admitted that they've got to stop lying to the people and said they're losing.
[00:45:35.349 --> 00:45:37.351]  Yeah, and the papers are fading quickly.
[00:45:37.351 --> 00:45:42.396]  The Globe and the Post, you know, they're the old media.
[00:45:42.396 --> 00:45:43.858]  There's no doubt about it.
[00:45:44.438 --> 00:45:47.280]  So I have two thoughts on that.
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.684]  One, I brag about it, compliment young people because they're attracted to it.
[00:45:51.684 --> 00:45:57.829]  We were able to run, you know, very successful campaigns and organize a lot of people through the internet.
[00:45:57.829 --> 00:46:02.172]  At the same time, we know technology is always advancing.
[00:46:03.013 --> 00:46:14.577]  And I think the question boils down, will the technology advance so quickly that our government can neutralize us and know everything that we're doing with the internet and cancels out when we make use of it?
[00:46:14.577 --> 00:46:21.439]  Or will we be able to get around them and be able to have our own protection about government invasion?
[00:46:21.439 --> 00:46:24.200]  Or some alternative, can it become internationalized?
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.821]  I don't know these techniques, but
[00:46:26.181 --> 00:46:30.764]  It's going to be technological, because the government's not going to go away quietly.
[00:46:30.764 --> 00:46:50.699]  They will have to admit one of these days, that the days of the three majors dictating everything to us are over, that the access to the internet and what we're trying to do with our new programming, I think is a real challenge to them, but under the conditions of today, that's what we have and we have to make the best of it.
[00:46:51.585 --> 00:47:00.189]  Incredibly said, and I'm not trying to sit here and gush over what you just broke down, but that's the battlefield and the establishment and cyber security admits this is a takeover.
[00:47:00.189 --> 00:47:03.811]  They're saying the Pentagon, the CIA will be involved in domestic psyops.
[00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:16.237]  They've always been, but now they're openly announcing it and that they want to use technology to crush the public and manipulate social networking instead of the people using it to restore freedom and liberty.
[00:47:16.237 --> 00:47:19.098]  So there is a battle, a war going on
[00:47:19.358 --> 00:47:31.028]  Do you agree that we're entering the event horizon and that it will be the individual out there right now becoming a citizen journalist and supporting independent media who will decide the future of this fight?
[00:47:31.536 --> 00:47:40.905]  Yeah, it will be, and we have to come to the understanding that it's just, you know, if you're a reporter for the Washington Post, that you have certain protections that we don't have.
[00:47:40.905 --> 00:47:50.974]  Everybody has the same protection for freedom of speech and publication, and everybody is a reporter, so everybody should have those same protections built in.
[00:47:51.354 --> 00:48:05.301]  But there will be a lot of contests and I'm optimistic that right now there is a galvanized youth movement that's listening to our message and that's where I get some encouragement.
[00:48:05.301 --> 00:48:13.646]  So I'm hoping that I can get some people to dial in and look at my website, my new website dealing with this channel.
[00:48:14.506 --> 00:48:23.010]  You know, wanted to get caught up on exactly what's happening and seeing what's going to happen, the announcement tomorrow as well as when the first program.
[00:48:23.010 --> 00:48:28.032]  The first program, I think I can let that go out too today because it'll come out tomorrow.
[00:48:28.032 --> 00:48:31.574]  And the first official program is going to be August 12th.
[00:48:31.574 --> 00:48:35.735]  And for people to know and get more information on this, it's very easy.
[00:48:35.735 --> 00:48:36.956]  RonPaulChannel.com.
[00:48:37.922 --> 00:48:41.623]  Absolutely, and this won't be released until tomorrow, but you guys sent it to us early.
[00:48:41.623 --> 00:48:46.185]  We have your press release here, August 12, 2013.
[00:48:46.185 --> 00:48:55.789]  So it will be launched, and you've already got hundreds of thousands of people that are signing up to be part of the channel.
[00:48:55.789 --> 00:49:03.892]  And if people will support InfoWarsNews.com, and if people will support RonPaulChannel.com, and if people will support
[00:49:04.552 --> 00:49:09.394]  The true new independent media and journalism will be able to hire the reporters.
[00:49:09.394 --> 00:49:10.915]  You'll be able to hire the reporters.
[00:49:10.915 --> 00:49:13.636]  We'll be able to hire the filmmakers, the researchers.
[00:49:13.636 --> 00:49:17.498]  I mean, I've spent, we did the math, Dr. Paul.
[00:49:17.498 --> 00:49:25.862]  In my 18 years, the amount of money I've made and put back in is $36 million that I've put in to InfoWars.com and what we do.
[00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:28.743]  And it takes a lot of money to be able to do this, folks.
[00:49:28.743 --> 00:49:31.784]  You need to go be part of RonPaulChannel.com.
[00:49:33.626 --> 00:49:38.574]  Before you go, give us in the next minute any tidbits about the channel and what's going to be on it.
[00:49:40.524 --> 00:49:48.847]  First thing, in the early part of the show, we'll go over some very, very current events, sort of like what we do when I talk on your program.
[00:49:48.847 --> 00:49:50.407]  What's the biggest event?
[00:49:50.407 --> 00:49:54.028]  We'll quote something in the news and I'll make my commentary on it.
[00:49:54.028 --> 00:50:03.151]  The big difference is, with this media, it's not like me being interviewed on regular media, where if I talk for a minute and a half, they cut me off, more like a debate.
[00:50:03.151 --> 00:50:04.951]  You know how they do.
[00:50:04.951 --> 00:50:05.952]  There's no time limit.
[00:50:05.952 --> 00:50:07.132]  There's no advertising.
[00:50:07.132 --> 00:50:07.972]  It's unfiltered.
[00:50:07.972 --> 00:50:10.093]  We can have an online Ron Paul filibuster.
[00:50:12.556 --> 00:50:19.640]  It makes me more comfortable because I'm not worried about how to pack in the 32 seconds everything I want to say.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:23.282]  You know, then you tend to want to speak quicker and this sort of thing.
[00:50:23.282 --> 00:50:27.965]  So it's a much more relaxed environment and we'll have guests.
[00:50:27.965 --> 00:50:35.690]  We're going to have guests on the shows and we're going to try to pick out incidents where individuals are making successes, you know.
[00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:36.630]  Wow.
[00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:17.833]  You know, you work so hard as a congressman, sometimes 18 hours a day on record, and you've always been extremely articulate, but I know that feeling of having a hundred things you want to say and then speeding up.
[00:51:17.833 --> 00:51:31.037]  Now that since you've been out of Congress just a few months, when I get a chance to interview you, you sound so much more relaxed, even more focused, and even more clarifying.
[00:51:31.037 --> 00:51:33.017]  Are you enjoying being out of Congress?
[00:51:33.017 --> 00:51:35.098]  Yes, and there is a difference because
[00:51:35.798 --> 00:51:41.362]  When people ask me about that, I say, at least I don't have to get on an airplane in the direction of Boehner.
[00:51:41.362 --> 00:51:43.784]  You tell me, we'll get on the airplane and get up here and vote.
[00:51:43.784 --> 00:51:53.490]  And the neat thing about my channel is that we have an office here in the Lake Jackson area where we put the studio.
[00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:55.532]  So I don't have to drive to Houston.
[00:51:55.532 --> 00:51:56.873]  I don't have to go anywhere.
[00:51:56.873 --> 00:51:59.875]  And that makes a big difference also.
[00:51:59.875 --> 00:52:01.836]  And it is more relaxing.
[00:52:03.497 --> 00:52:04.539]  I have more time to read.
[00:52:04.539 --> 00:52:08.743]  Matter of fact, I thought I'd be so busy and I'm having a little more time to write as well.
[00:52:08.743 --> 00:52:10.785]  So I feel pretty good.
[00:52:10.785 --> 00:52:12.046]  Absolutely amazing.
[00:52:12.046 --> 00:52:18.994]  Well, I look forward to speaking to you soon once the channel launches and I look forward to get you back on on the economy.
[00:52:18.994 --> 00:52:23.198]  Just briefly, we see the Federal Reserve bonds in trouble.
[00:52:23.198 --> 00:52:24.960]  You've been warning about that for a long time.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:25.781]  A brief comment on that.
[00:52:26.377 --> 00:52:27.118]  Well, yes.
[00:52:27.118 --> 00:52:35.208]  There was a statement out the other day on how many billions of dollars they lost because interest rates have crept up a little bit against their wishes.
[00:52:35.208 --> 00:52:38.472]  So that represents losses in the real value of those bonds.
[00:52:38.472 --> 00:52:41.295]  But it's not going to be the Fed, literally, that loses.
[00:52:41.295 --> 00:52:42.297]  It's the American people.
[00:52:43.277 --> 00:52:46.919]  Because the taxpayer stands behind that, and they can just print the money.
[00:52:46.919 --> 00:52:48.359]  They don't care about it.
[00:52:48.359 --> 00:52:49.100]  They're not a business.
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.801]  They don't have a profit loss.
[00:52:50.801 --> 00:52:54.642]  But the value of their assets did go down.
[00:52:54.642 --> 00:52:59.325]  It just means that they can liquidate that through inflation, and they just print more money.
[00:52:59.325 --> 00:53:01.446]  But it isn't the Fed that loses the money.
[00:53:01.446 --> 00:53:03.166]  It's the people.
[00:53:03.166 --> 00:53:06.228]  The only answer for that is get rid of central banking.
[00:53:06.228 --> 00:53:07.528]  We don't need the Federal Reserve.
[00:53:07.528 --> 00:53:08.529]  We need so-and-so.
[00:53:09.255 --> 00:53:10.937]  RonPaulChannel.com.
[00:53:10.937 --> 00:53:11.737]  Very exciting.
[00:53:11.737 --> 00:53:13.799]  Thank you for working so hard for human liberty.
[00:53:13.799 --> 00:53:14.099]  Thank you.
[00:53:14.099 --> 00:53:14.900]  Thank you.
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:15.280]  All right.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.582]  There goes former Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:53:17.582 --> 00:53:19.104]  Very exciting.
[00:53:19.104 --> 00:53:23.507]  And he was telling me during the break, he goes, if I have time, he wants me to be on the show with him.
[00:53:23.507 --> 00:53:30.814]  So very exciting to be on Ron Paul's show instead of him being on my show after 18 years that guy's been coming on my show.
[00:53:31.716 --> 00:53:41.202]  I remember, I said I've known Rand Paul for like 14, 15 years the other day, and then I happened to catch the rebroadcast locally at night, just that piece for about 10 minutes.
[00:53:41.202 --> 00:53:42.583]  That's not true.
[00:53:42.583 --> 00:53:43.404]  Time flies.
[00:53:43.404 --> 00:53:45.285]  I just keep saying 14, 15 years.
[00:53:45.285 --> 00:53:50.968]  I've known Rand Paul, now that I've thought about this, it's just weird how time flies.
[00:53:50.968 --> 00:53:54.791]  He'll probably end up being president if we're able to turn this country around.
[00:53:54.791 --> 00:53:57.613]  He's got a real shot at it except for the electronic voting machine fraud.
[00:53:57.613 --> 00:53:59.214]  I can read the tea leaves as anybody can.
[00:54:00.799 --> 00:54:05.762]  That I actually think I interviewed Rand Paul first.
[00:54:05.762 --> 00:54:13.567]  And I was going back in memory, I remember listening to something called Republic Radio before I was even on it.
[00:54:13.567 --> 00:54:23.172]  And I was on Republic Radio when Mark Kornke was running it with, I think it was Dan Thompson.
[00:54:23.172 --> 00:54:25.614]  But the point is, I remember hearing Rand Paul
[00:54:26.926 --> 00:54:49.230]  On with Mark Kornke, like in 1995, when I was just getting on AXS TV, I think it was like right out of college then, pushing his dad to get back into Congress, because he'd been in Congress in the 80s and then as a Libertarian, I think like the first Libertarian ever elected and then run out, and then he came back in 96.
[00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:56.192]  So I had just gotten on Threshold Radio in 96 and was able to call through Republic Radio
[00:54:57.418 --> 00:55:04.244]  And then I got Rand Paul's number, and I got Rand Paul on first, then I went and met Ron Paul.
[00:55:04.244 --> 00:55:08.148]  His district used to come up to Austin, South Austin.
[00:55:08.148 --> 00:55:13.472]  And so I met him, I think it was in Bastrop or something the first time, when he was just Dr. Ron Paul.
[00:55:13.472 --> 00:55:15.955]  He didn't even really have gray hair, had gray at the temples.
[00:55:15.955 --> 00:55:17.356]  That's how long I've known Ron Paul.
[00:55:17.356 --> 00:55:20.419]  1996, in person.
[00:55:20.419 --> 00:55:22.300]  I'm just waxing nostalgic here.
[00:55:23.822 --> 00:55:32.993]  Here we are, 18 years later, and the whole New World Order is attacking Rand Paul, the whole Republican establishment, the Democrats, Ron Paul's retired.
[00:55:37.252 --> 00:55:38.713]  It's just, it's weird.
[00:55:38.713 --> 00:55:43.194]  It's weird how life just goes by, and it's just interesting.
[00:55:43.194 --> 00:55:46.395]  It's interesting to, because it all gets foggy, you know, memory.
[00:55:46.395 --> 00:55:47.995]  And then you start thinking, oh, now I remember that.
[00:55:47.995 --> 00:55:49.196]  I remember this.
[00:55:49.196 --> 00:55:51.737]  I remember, and now it's 21st century.
[00:55:51.737 --> 00:55:54.117]  Ron Paul's going to have an internet channel that goes on TV.
[00:55:54.117 --> 00:55:56.078]  They've got TV stations lining up.
[00:55:56.078 --> 00:55:58.039]  I've been so busy.
[00:55:58.039 --> 00:56:00.859]  Let me make a prisonplanet.tv important announcement here.
[00:56:00.859 --> 00:56:05.581]  I've been so busy doing the Daily Radio Show, beta testing the nightly news for two years.
[00:56:07.779 --> 00:56:09.909]  Well, it's like a month before the blaze.
[00:56:09.909 --> 00:56:11.074]  Uh, you know, all that stuff.
[00:56:12.509 --> 00:56:17.511]  That I've never, we're finally finishing the big studio, and I'm going to give a tour of that soon.
[00:56:17.511 --> 00:56:19.292]  We're doing the satellite uplinks.
[00:56:19.292 --> 00:56:21.914]  The stations are pouring in in Minneapolis, St.
[00:56:21.914 --> 00:56:28.257]  Paul, Dallas, Chicago, New York, UHF, VHF cable channels.
[00:56:28.257 --> 00:56:32.979]  We're debating which systems to get, how much it costs to be on these things.
[00:56:32.979 --> 00:56:38.662]  And I've just got to get the official TV show, not the beta testing you've seen.
[00:56:39.642 --> 00:56:41.044]  Launched.
[00:56:41.044 --> 00:56:47.553]  I've got to do it because the world is waiting before they bring in the censorship like Ron Paul was a singer before they kill me.
[00:56:50.182 --> 00:56:52.524]  And then I tell myself, man, you shouldn't be pushing them so hard.
[00:56:52.524 --> 00:56:56.427]  You need to just kind of relax, get your show on, fight the new order that way.
[00:56:56.427 --> 00:56:56.908]  But you know what?
[00:56:56.908 --> 00:56:58.889]  I just don't even have time to worry about it.
[00:56:58.889 --> 00:57:00.451]  Ain't got time to bleed, folks.
[00:57:00.451 --> 00:57:02.092]  I'm just going full on against them.
[00:57:02.092 --> 00:57:03.753]  And it's up to God what happens.
[00:57:03.753 --> 00:57:10.719]  And it's up to you as well that God moves your heart, or if you don't believe in God, that intellectually you're moved, to spend your money with us.
[00:57:10.719 --> 00:57:14.022]  Because $36 million sounds like a lot.
[00:57:14.022 --> 00:57:16.104]  I know local talk show hosts that make $500,000 a year.
[00:57:18.243 --> 00:57:20.804]  Just local AM, FM talk show host.
[00:57:20.804 --> 00:57:26.125]  And you know, in 18 years, if they put all that in there, you'd be talking about $9 million.
[00:57:26.125 --> 00:57:36.428]  In 18 years, I mean, if I made $40,000 in 1996, I lived in a roach-infested one-bedroom apartment to put it all back into film equipment.
[00:57:36.428 --> 00:57:39.909]  And if I made $200,000, I put $150,000 back into it.
[00:57:39.909 --> 00:57:44.790]  And if I made $5 million in a year, I would spend all of it expanding.
[00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:46.331]  I mean, that's what I've done here.
[00:57:47.219 --> 00:57:58.387]  And that's why we're the maximum effort right now is to is to try to really officially launch PrisonPlanet.tv and that's a good name for those that are awake.
[00:57:58.387 --> 00:58:00.989]  I need to call it something else like the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:58:00.989 --> 00:58:07.594]  We've got a bunch of domain names and things and I've got to get all that done and I need to redesign InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.
[00:58:07.594 --> 00:58:08.015]  I need to
[00:58:09.825 --> 00:58:10.905]  I'm not a businessman.
[00:58:10.905 --> 00:58:12.646]  I'm not somebody that knows how to manage people.
[00:58:12.646 --> 00:58:13.806]  I'm just trying my best.
[00:58:13.806 --> 00:58:16.107]  So pray for us and financially support us.

[00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:31.731]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:31.731 --> 00:58:35.452]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:58:35.452 --> 00:58:37.212]  Just like you support the Ron Paul Channel.
[00:58:42.236 --> 00:58:46.210]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.106 --> 00:58:57.871]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.
[00:58:57.871 --> 00:59:02.114]  Fortunately, a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.
[00:59:02.114 --> 00:59:16.243]  Supernatural Silver is a new and vastly improved type of silver solution that is safe and extremely effective against 143 types of bacteria, both forms of viruses, mold and yeast, and a limited number of parasites.
[00:59:16.243 --> 00:59:18.164]  It can even purify water!
[00:59:18.704 --> 00:59:23.827]  Supernatural Silver comes in both liquid and gel for internal or external use.
[00:59:23.827 --> 00:59:35.615]  With over 180 scientific studies by independent universities, hospitals, research institutions and nursing homes, Supernatural Silver is a powerful weapon in the fight against disease.

[00:59:52.583 --> 00:59:54.964]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:54.964 --> 01:00:04.349]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:04.349 --> 01:00:05.650]  Big Brother.
[01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:07.431]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:07.431 --> 01:00:09.192]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.192 --> 01:00:10.773]  You want answers?
[01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:12.313]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.313 --> 01:00:16.516]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:16.516 --> 01:00:20.578]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.462 --> 01:00:29.607]  Well, the State Department is now coming out, as we speak, saying extremely, super high threat level.
[01:00:29.607 --> 01:00:30.367]  Be afraid.
[01:00:30.367 --> 01:00:31.608]  Be very afraid.
[01:00:31.608 --> 01:00:37.393]  You need the NSA to plant cameras, I guess, up your rear end to make sure Al Qaeda isn't hiding in there.
[01:00:37.393 --> 01:00:44.458]  While they publicly run Al Qaeda, and even the New York Times, as myself and Ron Paul talked about last hour, is out today.
[01:00:45.419 --> 01:00:47.800]  That story's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:51.140]  There's multiple articles where they admit, yeah, it's for political gain.
[01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:59.883]  And you know what, if they can't get their fake Al-Qaeda groups to attack, bomb Yemen, and then get them to hopefully attack something, so you can say, isn't it scary?
[01:00:59.883 --> 01:01:01.203]  Someone attacked us.
[01:01:01.203 --> 01:01:04.044]  Now we've got to run your life and rob your bank account.
[01:01:04.044 --> 01:01:08.505]  The great danger is the military-industrial complex run by foreign banks that's hijacked the country.
[01:01:09.133 --> 01:01:14.075]  Meanwhile, Texas-wide United We Stand overpasses for Obama's impeachment.
[01:01:14.075 --> 01:01:20.158]  One of our reporters was out driving around and just saw people hanging on overpasses to impeach Obama.
[01:01:20.158 --> 01:01:21.318]  And we went and looked it up.
[01:01:21.318 --> 01:01:24.379]  I'm going to get a story out on Infowars.com on this.
[01:01:24.379 --> 01:01:28.641]  Statewide United We Stand overpass for Obama's impeachment.
[01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:31.222]  Americans and the Constitution are under attack.
[01:01:31.222 --> 01:01:33.943]  Patriots are standing up across the country to say no more.
[01:01:33.943 --> 01:01:35.664]  We are urging demonstrations everywhere.
[01:01:36.820 --> 01:01:39.001]  Yeah, I think there should be spontaneous right now at the Capitol.
[01:01:39.001 --> 01:01:47.983]  I think everybody should just go down to the front of the Capitol, and they'll say you have to have a permit to be on the grounds, the great places in front of 11th Street, right in front, that's the best place anyways.
[01:01:47.983 --> 01:01:50.564]  Everybody should just show up down there right now.
[01:01:50.564 --> 01:01:52.664]  If 10 people show up, it's a victory.
[01:01:52.664 --> 01:01:58.646]  We need to get the idea of spontaneously coming out against the tyrants, coming out against the NSA.
[01:01:58.646 --> 01:02:02.527]  They're tracking all this, they may blow something up to say, see, you need us.
[01:02:02.527 --> 01:02:04.087]  We're like, hey, that's obvious.
[01:02:04.087 --> 01:02:06.128]  And we'll catch them like the Boston bombing in the act.
[01:02:07.984 --> 01:02:11.348]  They'll try to kill all the patsies before they can speak out.
[01:02:11.348 --> 01:02:15.213]  Everywhere are encouraging to get off the couch and take a stand.
[01:02:15.213 --> 01:02:20.700]  Right now, there will be overpass rallies against overreaching in the following locations in Texas.
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:23.022]  Folks, get out there with InfoWards.com.
[01:02:23.022 --> 01:02:24.624]  Get out there with whatever...
[01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:31.904]  Your maximum of liberty is, and say, down with the tyrants we know America is occupied.
[01:02:31.904 --> 01:02:34.244]  The July issue, I ordered 30,000 extra.
[01:02:34.244 --> 01:02:35.985]  We've still got a few thousand left.
[01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:42.667]  Ten bumper stickers, four big ones, six medium-sized, that say, America's been occupied by globalist forces.
[01:02:42.667 --> 01:02:44.427]  Infowars.com.
[01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:45.548]  Forbidden information.
[01:02:45.548 --> 01:02:47.188]  Infowars.com.
[01:02:47.188 --> 01:02:49.929]  You know, different variants to get people thinking.
[01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:56.574]  To get people reacting, to get people off their butts and into the mode of being aware of what's happening.
[01:02:56.574 --> 01:03:00.758]  We have an open tyranny coming down on us.
[01:03:00.758 --> 01:03:06.102]  And I'll tell you again, ladies and gentlemen, this show is in the eye of the storm.
[01:03:06.102 --> 01:03:08.885]  And I've got the eye of the tiger, to use that cheesy term.
[01:03:08.885 --> 01:03:09.305]  I do.
[01:03:09.305 --> 01:03:12.067]  I mean, I'm just boom, in their face, going in.
[01:03:12.067 --> 01:03:15.670]  Am I worried about how I'm going in?
[01:03:15.670 --> 01:03:16.131]  I'm going in.
[01:03:18.598 --> 01:03:20.460]  Damn the maneuvers, go straight at them.
[01:03:20.460 --> 01:03:23.563]  I think that was Lord Nelson said that.
[01:03:23.563 --> 01:03:27.787]  And the whole point is that I'm done playing games with the New World Order.
[01:03:27.787 --> 01:03:30.450]  These people are out of control themselves.
[01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:36.016]  You study globalists and top people, they're a bunch of dysfunctional, degenerate nutballs.
[01:03:36.016 --> 01:03:40.540]  And I am not going to sit here where a bunch of Stalin, Mao, Hitler,
[01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:47.021]  Fan club people play God over my life, okay?
[01:03:47.021 --> 01:04:02.049]  I've got a God, and it ain't you, Clapper, and Alexander, and Obama, and Big Sis, and the New World Order, and David Cameron, and Hollandaise sauce over in France.
[01:04:02.049 --> 01:04:02.709]  All of you!
[01:04:02.709 --> 01:04:04.650]  You people are a bunch of crazy freaks!
[01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:09.773]  It turned out in France, all the top socialists who passed 100% taxes on middle class and up.
[01:04:09.773 --> 01:04:10.093]  100%.
[01:04:10.093 --> 01:04:11.154]  They want all your money.
[01:04:12.128 --> 01:04:16.129]  That they're all exempt and have giant billion euro slush funds.
[01:04:16.129 --> 01:04:19.851]  And it came out, nobody got in trouble, because they have the military with the machine guns.
[01:04:19.851 --> 01:04:23.792]  Well, how about the people figure out that's wrong?
[01:04:23.792 --> 01:04:27.073]  We are going under total collectivization.
[01:04:27.073 --> 01:04:34.656]  100% taxes, and Obama hires the French economic advisor to bring them over here to run things in this country.
[01:04:34.656 --> 01:04:37.597]  You got a freak show of neocon scum.
[01:04:39.249 --> 01:04:47.276]  You got a freak show of all these fake liberals or a bunch of authoritarian trash?
[01:04:47.276 --> 01:04:49.819]  And they say in this press release, avoid social issues.
[01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:50.639]  I agree with that.
[01:04:50.639 --> 01:04:53.662]  Focus on the NSA violating all of our rights.
[01:04:53.662 --> 01:04:54.583]  Absolutely.
[01:04:54.583 --> 01:04:55.664]  Nationwide.
[01:04:55.664 --> 01:04:57.085]  Let's go to the streets!
[01:04:57.085 --> 01:04:57.646]  Let's do it!
[01:04:59.793 --> 01:05:03.655]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre-selected for us?
[01:05:03.655 --> 01:05:09.177]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential of information.
[01:05:09.177 --> 01:05:16.900]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your psyche.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:26.024]  From compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:05:26.224 --> 01:05:33.391]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:05:33.391 --> 01:05:36.453]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:05:36.453 --> 01:05:43.199]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand a war.
[01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:44.821]  Oh, there's another one!
[01:05:44.821 --> 01:05:45.781]  Another plane just hit!
[01:05:59.569 --> 01:06:01.471]  Introducing Pro-1.

[01:06:09.657 --> 01:06:15.782]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[01:06:15.782 --> 01:06:26.570]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.

[01:08:10.963 --> 01:08:12.504]  Well, so does he.

[01:08:16.688 --> 01:08:20.791]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.756 --> 01:08:32.259]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are spontaneous demonstrations popping up all over Texas.
[01:08:32.259 --> 01:08:33.220]  Banner hangs.
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:35.682]  One of my reporters was out and just saw it.
[01:08:35.682 --> 01:08:38.583]  They're all over the place.
[01:08:38.583 --> 01:08:44.167]  Some group called United We Stand, National Liberty Federation, has done this and it's been a success.
[01:08:46.192 --> 01:08:51.615]  I guess they got 51,000 people that like him on Facebook, and they're hitting the streets all over Austin, Dallas, Houston.
[01:08:51.615 --> 01:08:52.795]  We're getting the reports.
[01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.337]  We're sending reporters out right now to get photos.
[01:08:55.337 --> 01:09:01.139]  If you see these photos, take photos, if you see these banners, and send them to us.
[01:09:01.139 --> 01:09:04.701]  There are rallies on overpasses going on all over the place.
[01:09:04.701 --> 01:09:09.303]  And this is how we let the NSA and the globalists know we don't like what's happening.
[01:09:09.303 --> 01:09:12.265]  This is bipartisan against the tyranny of Obama.
[01:09:13.826 --> 01:09:21.029]  And this is calling for anyone who's concerned about the violation of our rights and our liberties and the Constitution to stand up.
[01:09:21.029 --> 01:09:25.230]  We're putting the press release out on Infowars.com right now.
[01:09:25.230 --> 01:09:28.571]  One of my reporters was actually sick today, and I said, look, you're sick.
[01:09:28.571 --> 01:09:29.492]  It was about 11 o'clock.
[01:09:29.492 --> 01:09:30.092]  I said, go home.
[01:09:31.519 --> 01:09:40.609]  He was driving, Chris Alanese, if he sees any more, tell him to take photos and send it to us, said he saw banners and rallies going on all over 35.
[01:09:40.609 --> 01:09:42.532]  And then he turned down another road and saw more.
[01:09:42.532 --> 01:09:48.658]  So this is definitely going on all over the state and in locations in Austin, Highway 183.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:54.187]  Breaker Lane, I-35, it's happening in Round Rock.
[01:09:54.187 --> 01:09:55.429]  I mean, it's on.
[01:09:55.429 --> 01:09:56.671]  And this certainly happened.
[01:09:56.671 --> 01:09:58.033]  People are angry.
[01:09:58.033 --> 01:09:59.736]  We ought to organize something like this.
[01:09:59.736 --> 01:10:01.078]  I think this should go nationwide.
[01:10:01.078 --> 01:10:01.819]  I'll talk about that.
[01:10:03.624 --> 01:10:04.444]  It is nationwide.
[01:10:04.444 --> 01:10:04.844]  Wow!
[01:10:04.844 --> 01:10:06.085]  This is wild.
[01:10:06.085 --> 01:10:11.146]  So just in Texas, there's 50 plus thousand, 57 thousand getting involved.
[01:10:11.146 --> 01:10:15.067]  And it's against the NSA, the drones, the tyranny, all of it, folks.
[01:10:15.067 --> 01:10:17.727]  It's time to let them know we're awake.
[01:10:17.727 --> 01:10:18.928]  Very exciting.
[01:10:18.928 --> 01:10:22.969]  We're posting this on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:10:22.969 --> 01:10:27.210]  Now, shifting gears.
[01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:27.450]  When
[01:10:29.298 --> 01:10:34.520]  The writer and editor at Rolling Stones' car blew up.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.580]  Michael Hastings.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.240]  I said we should investigate it.
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:42.842]  The eyewitnesses all said that they saw a big explosion in the street, then it flew off the road into the tree.
[01:10:42.842 --> 01:10:47.424]  Well, footage got released last week showing the car driving down the road and a big flash under it, then it goes off the road.
[01:10:47.424 --> 01:10:49.384]  Now they've released the 911 transcripts.
[01:10:49.384 --> 01:10:54.686]  The witnesses all saw the same thing that previous witnesses said they saw.
[01:10:54.686 --> 01:10:56.546]  A big explosion.
[01:10:56.546 --> 01:10:57.727]  His wife at the memorial.
[01:10:58.917 --> 01:11:03.941]  said that she was gonna quote bring down whoever did that.
[01:11:03.941 --> 01:11:09.165]  She told Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs that and others.
[01:11:09.165 --> 01:11:20.234]  One of his last emails was sent to Joe Biggs and others who Joe's talked to who are afraid to speak on record but they're the ones that talked about the feds going to his house the day before.
[01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:25.157]  He in an email said get ready for raids, get lawyers, I'm going into hiding.
[01:11:26.141 --> 01:11:27.883]  I'm going off the radar.
[01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.145]  It's CIA.
[01:11:29.145 --> 01:11:30.227]  Boom, his car blows up.
[01:11:30.227 --> 01:11:32.530]  I mean, that's not even 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[01:11:32.530 --> 01:11:34.953]  That's 1 plus 1 equals 2.
[01:11:34.953 --> 01:11:37.116]  We've got to investigate this.
[01:11:37.116 --> 01:11:39.198]  Now his wife, and I know she's under a lot of stress,
[01:11:42.754 --> 01:11:46.916]  Went on television with Piers Morgan of all people.
[01:11:46.916 --> 01:11:54.719]  We're going to play a short clip of that right now and then get Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs take on that.
[01:11:54.719 --> 01:11:55.820]  This is CNN.
[01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:58.601]  We're analyzing this piece right now.
[01:11:58.601 --> 01:11:58.881]  Here it is.
[01:11:58.881 --> 01:12:03.103]  The first time we're going to hear now from his widow, Elyse Jordan, who joins me exclusively.
[01:12:03.103 --> 01:12:04.143]  Elyse, good to see you.
[01:12:04.143 --> 01:12:05.124]  Thanks for having me.
[01:12:05.124 --> 01:12:08.725]  You've been a regular on the show as well, as well as Michael.
[01:12:08.725 --> 01:12:11.026]  Incredibly sad, incredibly tragic.
[01:12:11.026 --> 01:12:12.007]  How are you, first of all?
[01:12:13.314 --> 01:12:14.377]  Just taking it day by day.
[01:12:14.377 --> 01:12:17.426]  I was blessed to have the time with him that I had.
[01:12:17.426 --> 01:12:19.211]  So, I feel very lucky for that.
[01:12:19.211 --> 01:12:21.016]  And, you know, just taking it day by day.
[01:12:21.713 --> 01:12:29.379]  There have been, as there always are in these situations, wild conspiracy theories that he was chasing some hot story.
[01:12:29.379 --> 01:12:33.343]  Maybe connected to that is his late night car crash in Los Angeles.
[01:12:33.343 --> 01:12:34.764]  Other theories, too.
[01:12:34.764 --> 01:12:36.105]  Do you subscribe to any of this?
[01:12:36.105 --> 01:12:37.626]  Do you have any idea, really, what may have happened?
[01:12:37.626 --> 01:12:40.749]  You know, I have no doubt that he was pursuing a hot story.
[01:12:40.749 --> 01:12:43.291]  He always had at least five hot stories going.
[01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:44.812]  That was Michael.
[01:12:44.812 --> 01:12:51.217]  So... And he also... There will be published his profile of John Brennan in an upcoming issue of Rolling Stone.
[01:12:51.677 --> 01:12:51.817]  Okay.
[01:12:51.817 --> 01:12:52.618]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:57.119]  The interview's up on InfoWars.com, an article by Paul Watson, but this is a very interesting lady.
[01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:17.472]  Ms.
[01:13:17.472 --> 01:13:25.098]  Jordan, not Mrs. Hastings, married him back in May of 2011.
[01:13:25.098 --> 01:13:31.322]  Before that, she was the Director for Communications of the National Security Council, and I won't go over the rest of her pedigree.
[01:13:31.322 --> 01:13:35.245]  That is, is shadow government and above CIA, above everything.
[01:13:35.245 --> 01:13:37.307]  That is the top of the pyramid, folks.
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:39.661]  And, uh, very interesting.
[01:13:39.661 --> 01:13:42.102]  So I guess she knows.
[01:13:42.102 --> 01:13:49.645]  I guess she's changed her mind since she told Joseph Biggs and others that she was going to bring down whoever did this.
[01:13:49.645 --> 01:13:51.366]  Joe, I know this is hard for you to talk about.
[01:13:51.366 --> 01:13:53.207]  You couldn't even talk on the phone last night.
[01:13:53.207 --> 01:13:54.687]  It was so upsetting to you.
[01:13:54.687 --> 01:13:56.828]  You, of course, were in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:13:56.828 --> 01:13:59.750]  He was embedded with you in 2008 in heavy combat.
[01:13:59.750 --> 01:14:00.570]  You knew him for years.
[01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:02.571]  You were one of the people he sent.
[01:14:03.271 --> 01:14:05.172]  Yeah, I was a little unnerved by her calmness in that video.
[01:14:28.246 --> 01:14:33.291]  You know, just seeing it brought up in the news last night gave me goosebumps and it just put me in a hole.
[01:14:33.291 --> 01:14:39.096]  It just shifted my mood from being out and happy, hanging out with my friends, to just being sad.
[01:14:39.096 --> 01:14:41.258]  And I couldn't even hear the interview at first.
[01:14:41.258 --> 01:14:43.160]  I didn't even get to hear it until this morning.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:47.464]  But just to watch it, I mean, she just seemed happy.
[01:14:47.464 --> 01:14:53.850]  Either she's finally getting over this or she's one hell of an actor and she's trying to, you know,
[01:14:56.331 --> 01:15:00.233]  Play a facade and try to, you know, get everybody off his barrel.
[01:15:00.233 --> 01:15:03.135]  Who knows?
[01:15:03.135 --> 01:15:06.497]  Sergeant, I know we're walking in a minefield here.
[01:15:06.497 --> 01:15:08.018]  You know a lot more than you can say.
[01:15:08.018 --> 01:15:10.880]  So do I. So do his friends.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:13.421]  It's not just that she's putting a nice face on there.
[01:15:13.421 --> 01:15:15.943]  She has electric charm.
[01:15:15.943 --> 01:15:17.043]  Like a beauty queen.
[01:15:17.043 --> 01:15:18.885]  Like Miss America up there.
[01:15:18.885 --> 01:15:22.287]  And her eyes look like she's having the time of her life.
[01:15:23.147 --> 01:15:23.667]  I don't know.
[01:15:23.667 --> 01:15:25.228]  I just don't want to believe that she's...
[01:15:45.382 --> 01:15:48.185]  Come to that conclusion that it's a tragic accident.
[01:15:48.185 --> 01:15:52.428]  I mean, it is a tragic event that happened, but accident?
[01:15:52.428 --> 01:15:55.891]  I still just don't see that as a possibility.
[01:15:55.891 --> 01:16:01.576]  And there's too many, too many things out there, especially with that new video.
[01:16:01.576 --> 01:16:03.698]  Just seeing that, I mean, that just blows your mind.
[01:16:03.698 --> 01:16:06.341]  I mean, that right there is pretty intense.
[01:16:06.341 --> 01:16:11.165]  And then to just go on there and then say it's an accident, I just made my stomach hurt last night.
[01:16:11.909 --> 01:16:14.151]  You've got a distinguished military record in your own right.
[01:16:14.151 --> 01:16:15.792]  A lot of tours in heavy combat.
[01:16:15.792 --> 01:16:18.494]  You've been blown up in an armored vehicle before.
[01:16:18.494 --> 01:16:20.275]  You've seen things blow up.
[01:16:20.275 --> 01:16:24.037]  When you look at that, because all the police, military, they go, oh my gosh.
[01:16:24.037 --> 01:16:26.259]  You see the bomb go out underneath it.
[01:16:26.259 --> 01:16:27.780]  That's why the engine shot out the back.
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:29.901]  The bomb was clearly in the front and bottom.
[01:16:29.901 --> 01:16:31.302]  The engine shoots out the back.
[01:16:31.302 --> 01:16:33.204]  The car goes off the road.
[01:16:33.204 --> 01:16:36.026]  I mean, you've seen a lot of explosions and IEDs.
[01:16:36.026 --> 01:16:38.207]  I mean, what does that look like to you?
[01:16:38.207 --> 01:16:40.709]  What does it look like to the investigators I know you're talking to?
[01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:44.311]  I mean, it definitely looks like some kind of explosion.
[01:16:44.311 --> 01:16:46.293]  I mean, cars just don't do that.
[01:16:46.293 --> 01:16:58.020]  The way you see that bright light, and then you can just see the... Well, before you even see the explosion, you see his light, and it looks like, if you pay attention to it, it looks like he lost power.
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:59.241]  And then you see the explosion.
[01:16:59.241 --> 01:17:09.567]  You see his tail lights going through down the road, and then all of a sudden you just see nothing, and then you see a flash, like he lost control or just because the power went out or something in his car, and then you see those explosions.
[01:17:10.791 --> 01:17:12.192]  Absolutely.
[01:17:12.192 --> 01:17:17.574]  You see the power go out and then you see an explosion under the car and then it goes off the road into the tree.
[01:17:17.574 --> 01:17:24.197]  Exactly what our forensic people who went out there, reporters we had go out there, said it looked like the tree was barely even damaged.
[01:17:24.197 --> 01:17:26.718]  It came to rest up against the tree.
[01:17:26.718 --> 01:17:35.682]  Yeah, I've had three or four people go out there already and I just talked to a buddy of mine a second ago and he was out there the other day and the tree's pretty much unscathed.
[01:17:35.682 --> 01:17:36.783]  I mean, it definitely doesn't
[01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:40.611]  It looked like a car hit it at 130 something miles an hour.
[01:17:40.611 --> 01:17:43.773]  Well, the car looks like it's going 80 to me in the video.
[01:17:43.773 --> 01:17:45.434]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:17:45.434 --> 01:17:49.776]  What can you say about her texting you and then the phone call and her crying in the background?
[01:17:49.776 --> 01:17:52.358]  I mean, because she goes from that to this.
[01:17:52.358 --> 01:17:53.798]  That was two weeks ago.
[01:17:53.798 --> 01:17:56.160]  She heard that from the show we were going out there.
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.442]  I mean, can you talk about that or should we not go there?
[01:18:00.442 --> 01:18:05.184]  I mean, there's nothing really to it other than, you know, she seemed like she was completely fine.
[01:18:05.184 --> 01:18:06.245]  I told her that I was going.
[01:18:07.026 --> 01:18:23.652]  And then, you know, just a few days prior, she's, you know, her friend, she didn't even answer the phone, her friend answered the phone and said that Alyse wouldn't be talking and that she doesn't want us to go to LA and, you know, please don't go.
[01:18:23.652 --> 01:18:25.973]  And you could hear her crying in the background, correct?
[01:18:25.973 --> 01:18:30.214]  Yeah, you could hear some stuff, but it was just, it was just odd.
[01:18:30.214 --> 01:18:32.055]  And then now this, I just don't get it.
[01:18:33.953 --> 01:18:42.895]  Well, I mean, if my dad or my wife had just died a few weeks before, a month before, and I went on television, I guarantee I'd break down crying.
[01:18:42.895 --> 01:18:53.877]  I mean, she's just an amazing person, I guess, that she just, I guess, went through it all, so we can commend her for her just radiance, like it was the royal wedding or something.
[01:18:53.877 --> 01:18:54.277]  I don't know.
[01:18:54.277 --> 01:19:00.258]  I mean, but then again, you know, she could just be throwing people for a loop, who knows?
[01:19:01.258 --> 01:19:05.443]  I mean, she said she was working on an investigation herself, but who knows?
[01:19:05.443 --> 01:19:14.453]  Yeah, she told you that in text and in person, that she's doing an investigation, so I guess, uh... Amazing.
[01:19:14.453 --> 01:19:21.922]  That video footage, I'm just glad that they finally released something like that, because that's something that needed to be seen by a lot of people.
[01:19:24.269 --> 01:19:28.796]  A lot of people are starting to investigate a little bit further now in breaking down this footage.
[01:19:28.796 --> 01:19:39.552]  One of the guys, David Wayne, he wrote for Law & Order SVU, and I know he's got a lot of film analysts and stuff like that going through there.
[01:19:46.214 --> 01:19:49.215]  Stay there.
[01:19:49.215 --> 01:19:56.259]  Tell us what he told you as a forensic specialist and then I want to get your take on where we go from here with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[01:19:56.259 --> 01:19:58.380]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:19:59.929 --> 01:20:04.590]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[01:20:04.590 --> 01:20:10.532]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.

[01:21:29.474 --> 01:21:38.778]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:21:38.778 --> 01:21:39.578]  This capitalism?
[01:21:39.578 --> 01:21:45.741]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:21:45.741 --> 01:21:49.442]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:21:59.841 --> 01:22:07.366]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months.
[01:22:07.366 --> 01:22:11.068]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[01:22:11.068 --> 01:22:16.872]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos.
[01:22:17.742 --> 01:22:28.972]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive.
[01:22:28.972 --> 01:22:33.136]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[01:22:33.877 --> 01:22:42.560]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your guns and ammo.
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:46.402]  And it's not just in response to mass murders or preparing for war.
[01:22:46.402 --> 01:22:48.863]  It's something much darker.
[01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:54.545]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[01:22:54.545 --> 01:22:55.885]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[01:23:03.726 --> 01:23:06.769]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:06.769 --> 01:23:15.739]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:15.739 --> 01:23:20.645]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[01:23:55.509 --> 01:23:56.771]  Protect your immune system.
[01:23:56.771 --> 01:23:57.812]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:10.962 --> 01:24:13.544]  Alright, it's the final segment with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[01:24:13.544 --> 01:24:19.168]  I'm gonna have to get him on via Skype to really tell it all on record on the nightly news very soon.
[01:24:19.168 --> 01:24:20.989]  I appreciate his courage.
[01:24:20.989 --> 01:24:27.734]  You know, he's been in a lot of combat with embedded reporters and he was telling me off-air what they do compared to Hastings.
[01:24:27.734 --> 01:24:31.896]  And I gotta say, my gut is Hastings was more than met the eye.
[01:24:32.977 --> 01:24:36.601]  And the fact that he was scared when he called people, when he wasn't scared in heavy combat?
[01:24:36.601 --> 01:24:41.605]  Well, repeat what you just said, Staff Sergeant Biggs, and then let's get into what that forensic specialist has been telling you.
[01:24:41.605 --> 01:24:42.646]  Go ahead.
[01:24:42.646 --> 01:24:50.674]  You know, from day to day, you get reporters that come through, and a lot of them don't laugh a lot, and they get scared, and you know, it's...
[01:24:51.728 --> 01:25:00.916]  Like I said before, you get to learn a lot about somebody and just even in 30 minutes of combat, you can find out who really is somebody.
[01:25:00.916 --> 01:25:03.478]  Who's there to talk and who's there to do the walking.
[01:25:03.478 --> 01:25:07.522]  And a lot of these reporters will come in here, you know, acting all hard and this and that.
[01:25:07.522 --> 01:25:15.108]  And as soon as that bullet flew by their head, they'd shriek over and the little balls start crying and you know, they'd be calling their boss and say, get me out of here.
[01:25:15.108 --> 01:25:15.789]  I can't do this.
[01:25:16.329 --> 01:25:20.112]  You know, Mike would just sit there with a smile on his face and wouldn't flinch at all.
[01:25:20.112 --> 01:25:27.937]  I mean, I remember one day we were on this mountain top at the Pakistan border and we were getting attacked by a huge fellow Taliban.
[01:25:27.937 --> 01:25:35.061]  And, you know, we got Apache helicopters and little birds flying overhead, warthogs in the air diving down, shooting.
[01:25:35.061 --> 01:25:40.064]  We had Hellfire missiles going off by our head and, you know, artillery rounds, all this stuff going on.
[01:25:40.064 --> 01:25:41.085]  And he's just sitting there.
[01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:44.631]  Not shaken one bit just like the rest of us who are pros at it.
[01:25:44.631 --> 01:25:48.832]  I mean it was just to see him so calm compared to every report I've ever seen.
[01:25:48.832 --> 01:25:53.054]  I mean it was uh pretty intense.
[01:25:53.054 --> 01:25:55.635]  But he was scared before his death.
[01:25:55.635 --> 01:26:05.758]  Yeah and then you know to see this whole flip you know I've seen him in some of the most horrific situations any person could ever be in and he wasn't ever scared so to be able to
[01:26:06.798 --> 01:26:13.403]  You know, to hear that three, four, five days out, he was just, you know, out of his mind, scared.
[01:26:13.403 --> 01:26:18.087]  Well, you know why he wasn't scared of death, from what I've seen as a reporter?
[01:26:18.087 --> 01:26:22.891]  He was scared by what he learned, and that's what you and others are saying, is that he was freaked out.
[01:26:22.891 --> 01:26:25.974]  He went from saying, oh, we'll work with the government, to, they're the enemy!
[01:26:25.974 --> 01:26:26.474]  They're bad!
[01:26:26.474 --> 01:26:27.635]  We gotta stop them!
[01:26:27.635 --> 01:26:29.877]  Because of what he learned, and that's what got him killed.
[01:26:31.238 --> 01:26:36.121]  I have to tell you my expert opinion on this is he was probably CIA.
[01:26:36.121 --> 01:26:42.225]  A good guy thought he was trying to help America in a CIA army fight over turf wars.
[01:26:42.225 --> 01:26:46.548]  That's what some of my sources have said they believe the intel is.
[01:26:46.548 --> 01:26:50.331]  He found out some really bad stuff, wasn't going to be part of it, and he knew they were coming.
[01:26:51.152 --> 01:26:51.712]  I mean, who knows?
[01:26:51.712 --> 01:26:53.753]  There's so many unanswered questions right now at this point.
[01:26:53.753 --> 01:26:57.394]  I mean, just like I said, I've never seen a reporter so poised and so calm in combat.
[01:26:57.394 --> 01:26:58.054]  I mean, the guy was a pro.
[01:27:21.962 --> 01:27:26.743]  I'm sure he was.
[01:27:26.743 --> 01:27:38.685]  Yeah, and then we're not supposed to investigate it.
[01:27:38.685 --> 01:27:41.046]  In closing, in a few minutes we have other points you need to make.
[01:27:41.046 --> 01:27:45.767]  We're going to get you back on as soon as you can to Commercial Free on the Nightly News to break all this down.
[01:27:45.767 --> 01:27:48.227]  Tell us what the forensic people you're talking to are saying.
[01:27:49.881 --> 01:27:51.862]  Um, they said they noticed a lot of stuff.
[01:27:51.862 --> 01:27:59.727]  Like I said, the power going out, the explosion, um, how there's, you know, there's definitely no damage that could have been caused from that tree.
[01:27:59.727 --> 01:28:02.009]  Everything happened prior to the tree.
[01:28:02.009 --> 01:28:08.153]  Um, they said they noticed some, uh, really weird, uh, impacts around the roof area of the car.
[01:28:08.153 --> 01:28:10.734]  So that, that's pretty odd.
[01:28:10.734 --> 01:28:16.838]  Like, uh, like the roof was pushed out, like up and out a little bit, like a dent, you can see.
[01:28:16.838 --> 01:28:18.119]  So, um,
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:28.644]  I've got a group of guys that are just basically taking all that footage and going frame by frame by frame and supposed to be sending me a copy of all this breakdown.
[01:28:28.644 --> 01:28:32.706]  As soon as I get that, I'll get a copy sent over there to you guys.
[01:28:32.706 --> 01:28:33.447]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:33.447 --> 01:28:33.827]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:33.827 --> 01:28:37.148]  You've got our email contacts?
[01:28:37.148 --> 01:28:37.969]  Yeah, I got everything.
[01:28:37.969 --> 01:28:38.369]  I got it all.
[01:28:38.737 --> 01:28:39.097]  Okay, good.
[01:28:39.097 --> 01:28:47.245]  We'll double check that because as soon as that comes out, obviously the danger is while we're getting this ready, after it gets out, we're going to be protected somewhat.
[01:28:47.245 --> 01:28:54.191]  But this is definitely... Has this changed your views on anything, on how the world works?
[01:28:54.191 --> 01:28:55.392]  I guess you were already awake.
[01:28:55.392 --> 01:29:00.376]  That happened within six to seven months, my first time in Iraq, back in 2004.
[01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:20.332]  You know, you go out there and you're fighting for, you know, your country, and then all this stuff happens, and at the end of the day, you know, really all you're out there fighting for is just the guy beside you, and you kind of start wondering what this country's being all about right now sometimes.
[01:29:20.332 --> 01:29:23.296]  It's just so shady, the things that go on.
[01:29:23.296 --> 01:29:24.097]  It just saddens me.
[01:29:25.353 --> 01:29:26.214]  Absolutely.
[01:29:26.214 --> 01:29:31.578]  Well, Mr. Hastings was more than meets the eye, and the establishment figured that out, too.
[01:29:31.578 --> 01:29:35.201]  He was going to bring them down, and, well, they brought him down.
[01:29:35.201 --> 01:29:35.681]  Amazing.
[01:29:35.681 --> 01:29:38.964]  Joe Biggs, we appreciate your courage, Staff Sergeant.
[01:29:38.964 --> 01:29:45.609]  And I want to talk to you during the break about when we can get you on the nightly news for a full debriefing for everybody to get all the angles out.
[01:29:45.609 --> 01:29:49.111]  This is a big deal for the free press in this country.
[01:29:49.111 --> 01:29:50.512]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.512 --> 01:29:51.993]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.015 --> 01:30:00.199]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:09.585 --> 01:30:15.949]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.
[01:30:16.369 --> 01:30:18.651]  Not with SimpliSafe Home Security.

[01:30:59.703 --> 01:31:04.427]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:31:04.427 --> 01:31:07.549]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:31:07.549 --> 01:31:13.114]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease.
[01:31:13.114 --> 01:31:14.715]  It all comes down to one thing.

[01:31:21.339 --> 01:31:25.542]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.

[01:33:26.205 --> 01:33:30.467]  Coming up in the third hour, I'm gonna open the phones up and get into geopolitical news.
[01:33:30.467 --> 01:33:33.269]  All these hyped up terror alerts and more.
[01:33:33.269 --> 01:33:37.352]  Even the New York Times is admitting it's being done for political purposes to sell the idea
[01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:40.012]  of the NSA targeting the American people.
[01:33:40.012 --> 01:33:45.814]  Reuters admits they're giving local police NSA data on petty crimes.
[01:33:45.814 --> 01:33:53.555]  And then they have the police go and create a fake investigation to then go get warrants once they've already spied on everybody.
[01:33:53.555 --> 01:33:56.016]  I mean, this is just, this is unbelievable.
[01:33:56.016 --> 01:33:59.596]  And I told you this was going on because of my police sources.
[01:33:59.596 --> 01:34:02.037]  It's only done at first in like LA, New York.
[01:34:03.037 --> 01:34:04.519]  In the last decade is a rollout.
[01:34:04.519 --> 01:34:08.723]  Now they're giving even middle-sized cities access to NSA stuff.
[01:34:08.723 --> 01:34:16.890]  And of course 2,000 companies, it was reported, are given access to incredibly classified stuff and your private info.
[01:34:17.891 --> 01:34:20.755]  And all sorts of stalkers and people are using it.
[01:34:20.755 --> 01:34:22.817]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:34:22.817 --> 01:34:25.380]  So we're going to be talking about that coming up.
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:36.513]  We're also going to be speaking for the rest of the hour with Dan Bongino, the amazing Secret Service agent, who's such an eloquent speaker and running for political office, who
[01:34:38.092 --> 01:34:39.713]  Stands for liberty.
[01:34:39.713 --> 01:34:43.696]  And as the kind of person we need in office, he's like a, you know, a Ron Paul 2.0.
[01:34:43.696 --> 01:34:55.184]  So we're going to be talking to Dan Bongino, who left as a senior guy going up the, you know, top of the ranks, because he just couldn't sit there and hear Obama go, there's no tyranny around the corner.
[01:34:55.184 --> 01:34:57.385]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:34:57.385 --> 01:34:59.887]  Somebody else telling school kids socialism's good.
[01:34:59.887 --> 01:35:05.331]  We're going to be talking to him, though, about embassy security and things, because he's a real expert in that.
[01:35:06.520 --> 01:35:14.869]  Obviously being involved in that type of stuff in the overseas trips of the president, so we'll talk to him in a moment first off a few of the sponsors
[01:35:15.911 --> 01:35:19.074]  That make this national broadcast possible.
[01:35:19.074 --> 01:35:21.195]  I only have sponsors I believe in.
[01:35:21.195 --> 01:35:22.797]  So be sure and check these sponsors out.
[01:35:22.797 --> 01:35:24.378]  Supernatural Silver.
[01:35:24.378 --> 01:35:31.203]  Pathogens are becoming increasingly dangerous, causing deadly outbreaks at hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and restaurants.
[01:35:31.203 --> 01:35:34.806]  Antibiotics and ineffective because people are overusing them.
[01:35:34.806 --> 01:35:43.854]  The new Supernatural Silver, they've got a new upgraded formula, offers a safe and effective means of killing pathogens where antibiotics and other drugs fail, like their nasal spray.
[01:35:44.654 --> 01:35:47.797]  I mean, you put the stuff up your nose and you've got a sinus infection.
[01:35:47.797 --> 01:35:48.978]  The antibiotics don't work.
[01:35:48.978 --> 01:35:50.259]  It doesn't work for me.
[01:35:50.259 --> 01:35:51.200]  This does.

[01:36:35.748 --> 01:36:38.370]  Patriots and everybody need to be self-sufficient.
[01:36:38.370 --> 01:36:40.852]  Government is stockpiling food, weapons, you name it.
[01:36:40.852 --> 01:36:42.073]  Why aren't we?
[01:36:42.073 --> 01:36:44.455]  efoodsdirect.com forward slash Alex.

[01:36:47.097 --> 01:36:53.543]  Support the broadcast and getting the word out.
[01:36:53.543 --> 01:37:00.909]  Now there's a lot of things I want to talk about with our next guest, Dan Bogino, who again is running for political office in his state.
[01:37:00.909 --> 01:37:01.790]  We should all support him.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:16.297]  But first off, I wanted to get an update from him just overall since he resigned and discussed, which we're seeing more and more of, people in the military, people in defense contractors, people in Homeland Security, Secret Service.
[01:37:16.297 --> 01:37:21.304]  They just cannot be part of the shadiness that Staff Sergeant Biggs was just talking about.
[01:37:23.012 --> 01:37:24.873]  And they just can't be part of it.
[01:37:24.873 --> 01:37:27.815]  And it's kind of a catch-22, because then the good guys are out of it.
[01:37:27.815 --> 01:37:29.656]  So that kind of leaves the bad guys.
[01:37:29.656 --> 01:37:32.037]  But overall, it's the right moral decision to make.
[01:37:32.037 --> 01:37:40.322]  But I wanted to ask him, what does that mean as there's an exodus of people that you would call pro-America, pro-liberty, pro-common sense?
[01:37:40.322 --> 01:37:44.684]  And again, he's running for Congress, ladies and gentlemen, in Maryland.
[01:37:44.684 --> 01:37:48.266]  And he joins us, and we're going to give you his website as well.
[01:37:48.266 --> 01:37:49.847]  He's running for Maryland's sixth
[01:37:50.907 --> 01:37:53.528]  Yeah, it's not the first time, Alex.
[01:37:53.528 --> 01:37:55.108]  And thanks for having me, by the way.
[01:37:55.108 --> 01:37:56.529]  They've targeted my cars.
[01:37:56.529 --> 01:37:58.209]  My wife was eight months pregnant.
[01:37:58.209 --> 01:38:01.010]  Someone put nails in two of her tires.
[01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:03.090]  Four of my campaign staff, same thing.
[01:38:03.090 --> 01:38:05.171]  And campaign headquarters broken in two.
[01:38:20.075 --> 01:38:23.438]  You know, that's kind of what they do, and I just roll with it.
[01:38:23.438 --> 01:38:30.125]  You know, I'm 6'1", doing a 15-pound, so I'm more worried about my family than I am myself, but you know, that's what they do.
[01:38:30.125 --> 01:38:39.354]  It's thuggery at its finest, and unfortunately, when you speak out and you stand for liberty and you stand against it, and you know, I just want to make this one point.
[01:38:40.217 --> 01:38:42.178]  It's not just against the Obama administration.
[01:38:42.178 --> 01:38:42.839]  I think you know this.
[01:38:42.839 --> 01:38:45.181]  There are Republicans out there, too.
[01:38:45.181 --> 01:38:45.661]  Absolutely.
[01:38:45.661 --> 01:38:46.862]  Who care any less about liberty.
[01:38:46.862 --> 01:38:49.444]  There are some out there who care more about their own power than liberty do.
[01:38:49.444 --> 01:38:51.785]  So, it's a bipartisan indictment of the system.
[01:38:51.785 --> 01:38:54.687]  But you definitely put a target on your back when you do that.
[01:38:54.687 --> 01:38:55.368]  Absolutely.
[01:38:55.368 --> 01:39:03.253]  And Scripps Howard News Service, AP, you name it, have picked up all the burglaries and harassment that you're going through right now.
[01:39:03.253 --> 01:39:07.136]  I mean, that right there is the certification that you're the man right there.
[01:39:07.136 --> 01:39:08.537]  And the campaign's going well, isn't it?
[01:39:09.008 --> 01:39:14.198]  Yeah, I mean, you know, listen, when you're shaking people up, we've got a few left wing outlets coming after us.
[01:39:15.757 --> 01:39:23.281]  For everything from Shocker meeting with conservatives in D.C., left-wing media outlet went after him and said, yeah, he meets with conservatives in D.C.
[01:39:23.281 --> 01:39:24.501]  to advance conservative causes.
[01:39:24.501 --> 01:39:25.722]  It's a horrible scandal.
[01:39:25.722 --> 01:39:30.204]  You know, that we had some meetings with another journalism outfit, too.
[01:39:30.204 --> 01:39:32.465]  I mean, they make up stuff.
[01:39:32.465 --> 01:39:33.305]  It's really terrible.
[01:39:33.305 --> 01:39:40.369]  And, you know, if you only knew, folks, what went on behind closed doors, I mean, you would be disgusted if you think this government is
[01:39:40.769 --> 01:39:46.232]  It revolves around a citizen-centric model and that public service is a priority.
[01:39:46.232 --> 01:39:47.332]  And I've got bad news for you.
[01:39:47.332 --> 01:39:48.533]  You're living in a fantasy land.
[01:39:48.533 --> 01:39:52.735]  And there are some good people out there, don't get me wrong, but they're very few.
[01:39:52.735 --> 01:40:08.683]  And you mentioned it in the opening of the show, more and more people are just turning up their, you know, turning their head in disgust and walking away and finding out, not walking away from making a difference, but walking away and finding out a different way to shake up the system because it is unquestionably broken.
[01:40:09.653 --> 01:40:16.115]  You know, I know you saw a lot of things and you signed national security agreements so you can't talk about it or you'll go to jail like a whistleblower.
[01:40:16.115 --> 01:40:20.336]  But when you talk about the dirty deals behind the scenes, we've got a good idea.
[01:40:20.336 --> 01:40:23.997]  It seems like the corruption is so rampant now, they don't even get in trouble.
[01:40:23.997 --> 01:40:31.219]  I mean, you said it was the speeches and things was one reason you left, hearing Obama basically push stuff that Mao would push.
[01:40:32.899 --> 01:40:35.000]  I think that's obviously the main suspects.
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.502]  It would be other, you know, feds coming in because of what you do know.
[01:40:39.502 --> 01:40:43.064]  Aren't you in, probably, danger because of some of the things you saw?
[01:40:43.064 --> 01:40:49.546]  You may not even know what they were that's got them concerned, why they're breaking into your house and your car and places like that.
[01:40:49.546 --> 01:40:57.089]  I mean, my question is, if I knew all the stuff you knew, I'd probably go ahead and just say it, because then I think that makes you safer, is what I'm saying.
[01:40:57.089 --> 01:41:00.651]  Yeah, you know, it's not a bad point, but, you know, I did
[01:41:01.272 --> 01:41:06.637]  Swear an allegiance and my oath means something to me.
[01:41:06.637 --> 01:41:14.145]  And outside of the things I saw which were blatantly unconstitutional, which I have no obligation under my oath to the Constitution to keep quiet.
[01:41:14.145 --> 01:41:17.829]  Outside of those things, you know, obviously there are personal things I keep quiet.
[01:41:17.829 --> 01:41:21.152]  But, you know, this isn't full bravery on my part.
[01:41:21.152 --> 01:41:21.752]  I mean it, Alex.
[01:41:21.752 --> 01:41:25.216]  I'm not sitting here trying to sit there and pound my chest.
[01:41:25.748 --> 01:41:27.991]  But I just don't worry about it that much.
[01:41:27.991 --> 01:41:33.177]  I mean, my family and I took an enormous financial hit to do what we did to walk away.
[01:41:33.177 --> 01:41:36.741]  You know, by FBC records of public, you can look yourself.
[01:41:36.741 --> 01:41:38.603]  You know, we certainly didn't get rich off any of this.
[01:41:39.264 --> 01:41:41.165]  But the country's at a turning point.
[01:41:41.165 --> 01:41:43.307]  I mean, I mentioned this last time I was on your show.
[01:41:43.307 --> 01:41:47.330]  This is a real turning point, not one of those fictional turning points where people just like to rile you up.
[01:41:47.330 --> 01:41:48.551]  Oh, we're at the turning point.
[01:41:48.551 --> 01:41:49.232]  This is it.
[01:41:49.232 --> 01:41:55.897]  I mean, we are moving down one of these paths where your liberty is being treated like a commodity you can't exchange.
[01:41:55.897 --> 01:42:00.940]  It's traded amongst people and faux party officials and insiders and cronies.
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:04.043]  Your liberty, and yet, oddly enough, the one person out at the table is you.
[01:42:04.898 --> 01:42:13.620]  So, you know, you have to say to yourself, when you're someone like me on the inside, you know, and I honor and I respect the Secret Service agents who, you know, these guys and men and women are fantastic.
[01:42:13.620 --> 01:42:22.843]  They put their lives on the line, you know, in a heartbeat for the President and everyone else they protect, but I just didn't, I felt kind of like a parasite, like I was,
[01:42:23.484 --> 01:42:23.524]  J.I.? ?
[01:42:42.054 --> 01:42:43.455]  Dan, I admire you so much.
[01:42:43.455 --> 01:42:47.357]  I don't say that to be sappy, because I've gone through some of the same things you've gone through.
[01:42:47.357 --> 01:42:57.042]  The break-ins, the physical attacks, the death threats, where they're listening to your phone and tell you what you were talking about so you know it's the government or contractors.
[01:42:57.042 --> 01:43:00.724]  And for people that haven't experienced this, they don't know, and people say, aren't you scared?
[01:43:01.244 --> 01:43:03.326]  You know, why do you go, you know, out in public?
[01:43:03.326 --> 01:43:05.849]  Why do you go do the things you do with no bodyguards?
[01:43:05.849 --> 01:43:07.371]  And you know what?
[01:43:07.371 --> 01:43:09.032]  It's not even about being afraid.
[01:43:09.032 --> 01:43:11.975]  I've chosen a side, but it's not even choosing.
[01:43:11.975 --> 01:43:13.757]  I'm not a thug and a criminal.
[01:43:13.757 --> 01:43:14.838]  I'm not a scumbag.
[01:43:14.838 --> 01:43:16.460]  I'm not part of their gang.
[01:43:16.460 --> 01:43:18.963]  I don't even have free will, really.
[01:43:18.963 --> 01:43:19.643]  I have to...
[01:43:20.504 --> 01:43:28.970]  Confront and oppose these people, and I think that's what you just crystallized there, is that, you know, you're not beating your chest saying, I don't care, I'm not scared.
[01:43:28.970 --> 01:43:30.150]  It's beyond courage.
[01:43:30.150 --> 01:43:36.394]  It's, you know, you cannot commit the world to evil, and standing down is joining it.
[01:43:36.394 --> 01:43:40.357]  Silence is consent, and you will not be part of the dark side.
[01:43:40.981 --> 01:43:43.802]  Yeah, I mean, we're not... We're being ruled.
[01:43:43.802 --> 01:43:46.063]  We're not being governed anymore.
[01:43:46.063 --> 01:43:56.468]  You know, what made this country great and exceptional and different than every other place in the world is the respect and the dignity of individual liberty, a constitution that limited them, the government, not you.
[01:43:56.468 --> 01:43:57.288]  But I think what
[01:43:57.908 --> 01:44:07.594]  Unfortunately, a lot of the soccer mom crowd is ignoring the fact that your liberty is really disappearing in real time, and it has a real consequence, Alex.
[01:44:07.594 --> 01:44:09.375]  I mean, look at your economic liberty.
[01:44:09.375 --> 01:44:10.816]  What do you think taxation is?
[01:44:10.816 --> 01:44:21.543]  If you work for $100 a year using round numbers, and now upwards to 47% of 50% of it is taken by the government through sales, income, capital gains, corporal, these other taxes,
[01:44:22.043 --> 01:44:26.084]  Then 40% of the time you work for someone else.
[01:44:26.084 --> 01:44:27.845]  I mean, that's not liberty or freedom.
[01:44:27.845 --> 01:44:32.307]  You know, when you look at Obamacare, you folks, you really think that was about healthcare?
[01:44:32.307 --> 01:44:34.387]  Seriously, did you really believe that that was about healthcare?
[01:44:34.387 --> 01:44:38.549]  I assure you, having lived in this bubble, it had nothing to do with healthcare.
[01:44:38.549 --> 01:44:44.711]  It has everything to do with taking away life or death decision-making away from you and putting it in their pockets.
[01:44:44.711 --> 01:44:46.692]  I mean, we've never had any kind of education.
[01:44:46.692 --> 01:44:47.892]  The public school system
[01:44:48.312 --> 01:44:54.996]  It's death panels, it's socialist eugenics, absolutely, and it's buying and selling our liberties, trading them away.
[01:44:54.996 --> 01:45:07.604]  I want to get into the Benghazi situation, because you're somebody that was the head guy when Obama went overseas, so you know exactly what went on there, and it's coming out missiles to Al Qaeda and the stand down.
[01:45:07.604 --> 01:45:10.586]  But before we go there, let's right now make this important.
[01:45:10.586 --> 01:45:16.090]  You put it on the line, you didn't talk to me before you came on the air, you were coming on about the embassy stuff, I'm saying this now.
[01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:23.054]  Everybody in Maryland needs to stand with Dan Bongino and his family and get him into office.
[01:45:23.054 --> 01:45:24.514]  This is a real guy, folks.
[01:45:24.514 --> 01:45:25.255]  You can feel it.
[01:45:25.255 --> 01:45:25.935]  You can see it.
[01:45:25.935 --> 01:45:27.316]  Your gut tells you.
[01:45:27.316 --> 01:45:33.439]  We've got to put this guy in Congress with an overwhelming vote to overpower their electronic voting machines.
[01:45:33.439 --> 01:45:40.263]  These are the type of people we need there who have a conscience that that's their most valued possession is being honorable.
[01:45:40.263 --> 01:45:41.704]  And how do people donate?
[01:45:41.704 --> 01:45:43.224]  What's the best site to go to?
[01:45:43.224 --> 01:45:44.185]  Bongino.com?
[01:45:44.545 --> 01:45:45.306]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:45:45.306 --> 01:45:46.848]  P-O-N-G-I-N-O dot com.
[01:45:46.848 --> 01:45:48.771]  I appreciate that Alex.
[01:45:48.771 --> 01:45:48.991]  Thank you.
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:57.983]  Yeah, we've been very lucky.
[01:45:57.983 --> 01:45:59.604]  Last time we ran, we started with nothing.
[01:45:59.604 --> 01:46:07.693]  I had two donors, me and my father, and we built the largest donor list in Maryland, one of the largest donor lists in the Northeast Corridor.
[01:46:07.693 --> 01:46:10.156]  We really fired up a grassroots base.
[01:46:10.156 --> 01:46:15.903]  You know, it's funny, Alex, people would say to me when I would give speeches, because I never wrote them, I would just go out and speak from the heart.
[01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:18.624]  People say, wow, I've never heard anything like that before.
[01:46:18.624 --> 01:46:20.845]  You know, that's the sad part.
[01:46:20.845 --> 01:46:24.386]  That all I did was just tell you the truth, and you thought it was good.
[01:46:24.386 --> 01:46:25.386]  It wasn't good.
[01:46:25.386 --> 01:46:34.969]  It was just unusual because you're so not used to hearing the truth from people that when a guy gets up there and speaks with some passion about what's really happening, you think it's, quote, good.
[01:46:34.969 --> 01:46:36.670]  There's nothing good about it.
[01:46:36.670 --> 01:46:37.570]  It's just the truth.
[01:46:37.570 --> 01:46:39.171]  The truth has no agenda.
[01:46:39.171 --> 01:46:43.492]  And we just built a massive army of people, starting this time with, obviously,
[01:46:43.932 --> 01:46:46.973]  A lot easier than last time where we had to build it from scratch.
[01:46:46.973 --> 01:46:48.914]  Now we have a solid base of support.
[01:46:48.914 --> 01:46:54.515]  We have a huge social media following on Facebook and Twitter and it really helps me get the liberty message out there.
[01:46:54.515 --> 01:47:00.497]  I try to tweet on Facebook about liberty at least two or three times a week and it's never scripted.
[01:47:00.497 --> 01:47:11.961]  I come home, I'll usually put on some music and I will just go and tell people how I really feel and what I saw and what I think is really wrong and importantly how we can fix this disaster we're in now.
[01:47:13.323 --> 01:47:14.586]  Absolutely.
[01:47:14.586 --> 01:47:18.012]  And folks can go to Bongino.com and find your Twitter, find your Facebook.
[01:47:18.012 --> 01:47:19.194]  Everybody should follow you there.
[01:47:19.194 --> 01:47:24.043]  In fact, I'm going to tweet out during the next break from real Alex Jones that Twitter for folks to follow.
[01:47:25.146 --> 01:47:25.266]  You
[01:47:45.026 --> 01:47:46.067]  I don't think so.
[01:48:03.038 --> 01:48:04.219]  You've got to do the same thing.
[01:48:04.219 --> 01:48:05.740]  Enough is enough, folks.
[01:48:05.740 --> 01:48:08.903]  The war for this republic is now.
[01:48:08.903 --> 01:48:13.046]  Now, shifting gears, speaking of bullets, they put bullets in Ambassador Stevens.
[01:48:13.046 --> 01:48:22.994]  Knowing what you know about embassy security, a lot of it classified, running foreign operations when the president would go overseas and visit embassies, what is going on from a trained eye when you see that?
[01:48:23.715 --> 01:48:31.201]  Well, what I found out about this is there have been communications between Al-Zawahiri in Pakistan and in Yemen.
[01:48:31.201 --> 01:48:33.903]  One of the main AQAP operators in Yemen.
[01:48:33.903 --> 01:48:37.105]  But the brazenness of the communication strikes me.
[01:48:37.105 --> 01:48:37.866]  Here's what I mean.
[01:48:38.522 --> 01:48:45.464]  These guys are very, and I don't mean this qualitatively please, but they're very savvy in a devious way with their communication.
[01:48:45.464 --> 01:48:51.746]  They've learned everything from using drop boxes in emails that don't formally send it, all kinds of stuff.
[01:48:51.746 --> 01:48:56.548]  I don't want to give anybody else any ideas, but ways to manipulate cell phones so they can't be traced.
[01:48:56.548 --> 01:48:58.669]  They are very savvy in that respect.
[01:48:58.669 --> 01:49:06.051]  The fact that they likely knew they were being monitored, which of course they know, and brazenly made these kind of communications knowing it was going to get out there,
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:12.298]  Um, it says to me, from having gone through this over and over and having read volumes of intel reports at overseas ops,
[01:49:13.047 --> 01:49:26.418]  Well, this was really in the end operational stage and any fear of having the operation broken up was probably not really, didn't frighten them enough to, you know, to believe that this thing was ready to go.
[01:49:26.418 --> 01:49:31.622]  But the problem, Alex, is I don't really trust this administration anymore with their information.
[01:49:31.622 --> 01:49:37.807]  They've lost all credibility between Benghazi and we don't even know what was going on there with potential gun running.
[01:49:37.807 --> 01:49:39.909]  I mean, they really don't have any credibility.
[01:49:39.909 --> 01:49:41.390]  The only thing that makes me believe this is
[01:49:41.870 --> 01:49:54.918]  This could be really credible, and I hope it's not, is that a lot of the foreign embassies have shut down too, and we're usually pretty reluctant, especially after Iraq, to be sharing information and intel with foreign embassies and foreign governments.
[01:49:54.918 --> 01:49:58.320]  Sure, well, I mean, Obama's bad enough, and I know they'll crucify him, if you agree with me.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:09.808]  He's bad enough, and even the New York Times says these terror alerts are being used for political purposes to distract from NSA, to turn a blind eye and let some jihadi group fund it up the chain.
[01:50:09.808 --> 01:50:14.611]  They're funding them in Syria and Libya to attack a few embassies as a political distraction.
[01:50:14.611 --> 01:50:16.893]  This could also be a false flag Obama's about to pull.
[01:50:17.366 --> 01:50:22.648]  Well, this NSA thing, you know, they need to get the attention off this thing so badly.
[01:50:22.648 --> 01:50:34.633]  And I really, I cannot believe, I mean, really, there's a part of me that is having a hard time digesting the fact that there are people who call themselves Republicans out there who actually support this program.
[01:50:34.633 --> 01:50:35.113]  You know, folks,
[01:50:36.172 --> 01:50:41.256]  Information in the hands of a government without an independent arbiter reviewing it.
[01:50:41.256 --> 01:50:45.359]  Remember, the Constitution, you know, it's secure in your effects, right?
[01:50:45.359 --> 01:50:51.524]  Without a warrant, or an independent... because I don't consider the FISA court... it's not... it's a rubber stamp, okay?
[01:50:51.524 --> 01:50:54.246]  Former Secret Service agent Dan Mangino.
[01:50:54.246 --> 01:50:54.767]  Stay there, sir.
[01:50:54.767 --> 01:50:58.750]  We're gonna come right back to you and have you finish that point on Benghazi and more.
[01:51:01.232 --> 01:51:05.435]  Raising your own chickens for food is great, but how will you get them ready for the dinner table?

[01:54:00.097 --> 01:54:05.499]  Dan Mangino, senior Secret Service agent until he resigned.
[01:54:16.195 --> 01:54:18.476]  He ran the overseas operations.
[01:54:18.476 --> 01:54:24.877]  That's the most important thing the Secret Service does when the President goes anywhere, is the overseas business.
[01:54:24.877 --> 01:54:28.478]  They see that as the most dangerous, at least from what I've read in the newspapers.
[01:54:28.478 --> 01:54:32.719]  And you were telling me some stuff off-air about your sources in the Secret Service currently.
[01:54:32.719 --> 01:54:43.162]  I don't know how much you can say on-air, but just say what you can about Benghazi, where it's going, about the current threat, and the points you were making about Obama's credibility.
[01:54:43.837 --> 01:54:45.999]  Well, first off, you have an extremely loyal audience.
[01:54:45.999 --> 01:54:48.481]  Thanks to those who just followed me on Facebook.
[01:54:48.481 --> 01:54:49.862]  That's a record.
[01:54:49.862 --> 01:54:55.506]  Considering I've been on a number of radio stations, that's a record amount of Facebook likes in the last couple of minutes.
[01:54:55.506 --> 01:54:56.306]  So thank you, folks.
[01:54:56.306 --> 01:54:57.487]  That's a great idea.
[01:54:57.487 --> 01:55:01.430]  Yeah, a lot of my intel on military sources have been talking to me over and over.
[01:55:01.430 --> 01:55:03.332]  I have a book coming out in November on this topic.
[01:55:03.892 --> 01:55:10.435]  And, folks, if you don't believe there was a stand-down order here, really, you're living in a fantasy land.
[01:55:10.435 --> 01:55:16.138]  I just hate to tell you this, but there's a team out there, Alex Fess, Foreign Emergency Support Team.
[01:55:16.138 --> 01:55:17.399]  Here's an analogy.
[01:55:17.399 --> 01:55:20.660]  Imagine with the Secret Service, God forbid, something was to happen to the President, right?
[01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:23.642]  No one has to be told in the Secret Service to respond.
[01:55:23.642 --> 01:55:24.482]  You just go.
[01:55:24.482 --> 01:55:25.903]  That's what you do.
[01:55:25.903 --> 01:55:29.285]  Well, that's what the Fess team does, the Foreign Emergency Support Team.
[01:55:29.285 --> 01:55:31.706]  They've responded to these types of incidents before.
[01:55:32.415 --> 01:55:33.936]  Why they didn't respond?
[01:55:33.936 --> 01:55:36.538]  They should have set up red flags everywhere.
[01:55:36.538 --> 01:55:40.542]  It was brought up in the Capitol Hill testimony and the media has largely ignored it.
[01:55:40.542 --> 01:55:45.586]  I wrote an op-ed piece in the Washington Times about this because I've got friends who have been talking to me about it.
[01:55:45.586 --> 01:55:48.188]  These guys were told not to go.
[01:55:48.188 --> 01:55:52.031]  There is no question in my mind this was politically motivated.
[01:55:52.031 --> 01:55:54.513]  I hate to tell you that folks, but if you're ignoring this,
[01:55:54.932 --> 01:56:02.559]  You're ignoring it at your own peril, because that fabric of security that those guys, Secret Service and DSS provide, has been absolutely shredded.
[01:56:02.559 --> 01:56:06.642]  The cavalry always showed up at the pass, and that promise has been broken.
[01:56:06.642 --> 01:56:07.343]  That's very dangerous.
[01:56:07.788 --> 01:56:12.331]  Why would they do something like this to show their hind end to everybody in the government?
[01:56:12.331 --> 01:56:14.133]  Because the whole Pentagon knows it was a stand down.
[01:56:14.133 --> 01:56:16.234]  They watched it from the Predator drones.
[01:56:16.234 --> 01:56:17.135]  The ships all know.
[01:56:17.135 --> 01:56:20.978]  I've talked to a lot of people off record who were able to even see it.
[01:56:20.978 --> 01:56:22.699]  Some major fits were thrown.
[01:56:22.699 --> 01:56:23.720]  People resigned.
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:25.001]  Major generals.
[01:56:25.001 --> 01:56:26.382]  You name it.
[01:56:26.382 --> 01:56:33.067]  Why would the Obama administration do something like this protecting the jihadis there in Benghazi?
[01:56:33.712 --> 01:56:35.774]  There's only two explanations here, folks.
[01:56:35.774 --> 01:56:42.561]  One, they are the most incompetent administration in presidential history and literally didn't know what to do.
[01:56:42.561 --> 01:56:48.808]  So he just, I mean, we already know he went upstairs to the living quarters without any resolution to the incident whatsoever.
[01:56:48.808 --> 01:56:51.791]  So that's explanation possibility number one, which I don't believe.
[01:56:52.171 --> 01:57:06.540]  The second explanation is they knew exactly what they were doing, and given the proximity to the presidential election, they could not have out in public that one, there was a terrorist attack, and two, their foreign policy in Libya had collapsed, and three, a CIA operation was going to be uncovered.
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:13.525]  So the second fork in that road is that they knew exactly what they were doing, and for political reasons, they let these four guys die.
[01:57:14.165 --> 01:57:14.965]  Folks, bad news.
[01:57:14.965 --> 01:57:18.947]  Either one of those answers is horrific for any leader.
[01:57:18.947 --> 01:57:24.948]  Either one is treason and either one is completely criminal.
[01:57:24.948 --> 01:57:33.591]  And now CNN, London Telegraph, they're all reporting CIA people have told them that, no, we were giving service-to-air anti-aircraft missiles to Al-Qaeda.
[01:57:34.226 --> 01:57:37.690]  Yeah, and Al-Qaeda, a lot of this doesn't make sense when you think about it.
[01:57:37.690 --> 01:57:48.324]  There have been some people hinting around this now, that why if we were running these guns and these surface-to-air missiles and these advanced weapons to Syrian rebels who were embedded with Al-Qaeda?
[01:57:48.324 --> 01:57:49.585]  I don't think anybody disputes that.
[01:57:49.585 --> 01:57:50.727]  I don't know who they're talking about, at least.
[01:57:51.187 --> 01:57:54.889]  Why would Al-Qaeda, Duentar al-Sharia, attack the complex?
[01:57:54.889 --> 01:58:04.613]  There may be an Iranian Hezbollah access here that a couple of people are starting to hint around to, which would open up a whole different can of worms.
[01:58:04.613 --> 01:58:08.255]  But again, you can't trust anything that comes from this administration.
[01:58:08.255 --> 01:58:09.895]  They've blown all their credibility.
[01:58:09.895 --> 01:58:11.156]  They put Jay Carney up there.
[01:58:11.156 --> 01:58:12.496]  You know, that's an interesting point.
[01:58:12.496 --> 01:58:12.837]  Stay there.
[01:58:12.837 --> 01:58:15.538]  We've got to come back in five more minutes with you, and I appreciate your time.
[01:58:15.538 --> 01:58:17.799]  Iran does not want those missiles getting
[01:58:18.739 --> 01:58:22.121]  Uh, into Syria, because once Syria falls, Iran's next.
[01:58:22.121 --> 01:58:23.602]  That's actually an interesting point.
[01:58:23.602 --> 01:58:24.783]  That's what your sources are saying?
[01:58:24.783 --> 01:58:25.924]  That could be what's going on?
[01:58:25.924 --> 01:58:27.665]  Yes, but it doesn't make sense, Alex.
[01:58:27.665 --> 01:58:31.268]  Why would Al-Qaeda attack an operation funding Al-Qaeda in Syria?
[01:58:31.268 --> 01:58:32.589]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:58:32.589 --> 01:58:40.454]  Vested interest is with... Unless you want to get rid of the ambassador and the witnesses.
[01:58:40.454 --> 01:58:43.956]  You are listening to GCN.

[01:58:49.926 --> 01:58:54.610]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[01:58:54.610 --> 01:59:00.556]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[01:59:00.556 --> 01:59:02.498]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[01:59:02.498 --> 01:59:03.119]  It's food.

[02:00:04.588 --> 02:00:09.413]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:09.413 --> 02:00:11.014]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.014 --> 02:00:12.556]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.556 --> 02:00:16.740]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:16.740 --> 02:00:20.824]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:31.274 --> 02:00:36.275]  You know, I could talk to Mr. Bongino for a long, long time.
[02:00:36.275 --> 02:00:37.435]  He is so interesting.
[02:00:37.435 --> 02:00:38.895]  Dan Bongino.
[02:00:38.895 --> 02:00:40.135]  Bongino.com.
[02:00:40.135 --> 02:00:42.616]  I'm Alex Jones with Infowars.com.
[02:00:42.616 --> 02:00:46.337]  But I'm going to get him back for a full hour here in the near future so we can take phone calls from folks.
[02:00:46.337 --> 02:00:50.677]  He's a very interesting fellow, and he can tell Secret Service stories that aren't classified.
[02:00:50.677 --> 02:00:53.078]  And I've got stuff like marijuana.
[02:00:53.078 --> 02:00:54.678]  They've got a rain tax and stuff.
[02:00:54.678 --> 02:00:56.578]  I mean, this just shows the insanity.
[02:00:56.578 --> 02:00:57.919]  He's running for Congress there.
[02:00:57.919 --> 02:00:59.199]  You got cut off by the break.
[02:00:59.199 --> 02:01:00.219]  We've only got five minutes here.
[02:01:01.119 --> 02:01:21.176]  You were getting into, as an investigator, the forks in the road, and that's exactly what I've done with Congress people and other investigators and FBI people we've had on air, and you name it, is that in an investigation, there's no doubt there's a stand down, there's no doubt they're lying, and then you just have to look at the facts, it goes from bad to worse, but go ahead and complete what you were saying.
[02:01:21.596 --> 02:01:36.682]  Yeah, and the nonsensical statement by the administration, and frankly some of the folks in the upper ranks of the military who said, well we don't send people into, and these are not the rank and file military guys, these guys are really upset.
[02:01:36.682 --> 02:01:37.923]  They're the ones you're probably talking to.
[02:01:37.923 --> 02:01:39.043]  I know the ones that are calling me.
[02:01:39.043 --> 02:01:40.724]  These are the guys that wanted a response.
[02:01:41.244 --> 02:01:44.925]  That, you know, we don't send troops into, you know, the unknown.
[02:01:44.925 --> 02:01:46.145]  Really?
[02:01:46.145 --> 02:01:53.367]  You already sent the ambassador and these three others that died, these patriots that died over there into the unknown.
[02:01:53.367 --> 02:02:02.448]  So you don't send our military and guys who want to go in to save them and protect them when their mission is to, you know, wrap themselves in the flag?
[02:02:02.448 --> 02:02:03.789]  Oh, it's total bull!
[02:02:03.789 --> 02:02:05.009]  As you said, the default.
[02:02:05.749 --> 02:02:09.050]  If a submarine sinks, they launch the submarine rescue crew.
[02:02:09.050 --> 02:02:09.970]  It's default.
[02:02:09.970 --> 02:02:12.891]  Or if the President's attacked, the Secret Service goes into action.
[02:02:12.891 --> 02:02:14.532]  Or the State Department has their units.
[02:02:14.532 --> 02:02:16.212]  It's just a total lie.
[02:02:16.212 --> 02:02:18.013]  Folks, you know, you're being manipulated.
[02:02:18.013 --> 02:02:24.335]  I don't want to sound conspiratorial or scary, but there is a crop of people that this
[02:02:25.439 --> 02:02:41.128]  It's this tyrannical group of insiders, crony capitalists, politicians who only care about the next election, consultant class folks, and elected officials, some from both sides, that their only interest is in preserving this system.
[02:02:41.128 --> 02:02:41.969]  Their only interest.
[02:02:41.969 --> 02:02:43.330]  I mean, why don't we think about it?
[02:02:43.330 --> 02:02:48.653]  Frank Wolf's initiative to move this special select committee forward to get subpoena power on Benghazi.
[02:02:49.153 --> 02:02:52.394]  Why hasn't everyone in Congress signed on to this?
[02:02:52.394 --> 02:02:55.075]  That's because you don't want the answers.
[02:02:55.075 --> 02:02:56.155]  They don't want to tell you the truth.
[02:02:56.155 --> 02:02:57.576]  You're being manipulated.
[02:02:57.576 --> 02:03:01.277]  Just like on NSA, it turned out Congress knew about it all.
[02:03:01.277 --> 02:03:02.097]  Went along with it.
[02:03:02.097 --> 02:03:03.898]  They wanted to act like they didn't know.
[02:03:03.898 --> 02:03:05.858]  You know, they have a name for this.
[02:03:05.858 --> 02:03:07.459]  It's organized crime.
[02:03:07.459 --> 02:03:09.579]  It's a gang.
[02:03:09.579 --> 02:03:12.860]  But, oh no, there can't be gangs in our government.
[02:03:12.860 --> 02:03:13.821]  Yeah, there can.
[02:03:13.821 --> 02:03:15.181]  Historically, it's called tyranny.
[02:03:17.077 --> 02:03:19.738]  This NSA program was so fantastic, right?
[02:03:19.738 --> 02:03:25.660]  And it was worth collecting data on every single American, by the way, which is an absolute travesty.
[02:03:25.660 --> 02:03:28.040]  Don't tell me it's constitutional, okay?
[02:03:28.040 --> 02:03:31.821]  That is absolute hogwash nonsense.
[02:03:31.821 --> 02:03:34.242]  Why didn't we stop the Benghazi attack?
[02:03:34.242 --> 02:03:36.383]  Why didn't we stop the Boston attack?
[02:03:36.383 --> 02:03:41.104]  The answer is because this is just lazy bureaucratic ineffectiveness.
[02:03:41.104 --> 02:03:46.766]  And I'll tell you what, it's based on, just so people know, this whole metadata thing is based on a concept.
[02:03:46.886 --> 02:03:53.073]  Yeah, they're calling all of our privacy metadata when it has nothing to do with using that term to deceive people.
[02:04:08.703 --> 02:04:18.555]  Right, you know what, I've said to folks over and over again, here's what's going to happen, let me paint a scenario for you quickly, because I wasn't an investigator, I saw this, but from the inside, you give government information it's going to be abuse.
[02:04:18.555 --> 02:04:21.538]  It is not a matter of if, it is only a matter of when.
[02:04:21.538 --> 02:04:26.504]  What's going to happen is they're going to need, say, Target A to get to Target B. Target A didn't
[02:04:26.684 --> 02:04:28.505]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:04:28.505 --> 02:04:29.026]  Five more minutes.
[02:04:29.026 --> 02:04:29.686]  We've got to go to break.
[02:04:29.686 --> 02:04:31.448]  That's a short segment at the start of the hour.
[02:04:31.448 --> 02:04:36.311]  Come back and finish your story, and then we'll talk about the campaign briefly, and the book that's coming out, and then let you go.
[02:04:36.311 --> 02:04:41.175]  And then, folks, I'm going to get into the travesty of foster care, the state-run agencies.
[02:04:41.175 --> 02:04:47.139]  Sevenfold, the Justice Department admits, more dangerous to be in foster care than in anybody else's custody.
[02:04:47.139 --> 02:04:53.104]  And all the kids that are dying, from parents who are having their kids taken because they get caught with a joint.
[02:04:53.104 --> 02:04:54.285]  And then the kid's dead.
[02:04:54.285 --> 02:04:55.285]  The state kills them.
[02:04:55.285 --> 02:04:55.886]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:00.549 --> 02:05:08.313]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all caused by infectious pathogens.

[02:08:24.209 --> 02:08:28.512]  Folks, coming up, all over the country, it's happening all over the place in Austin.
[02:08:28.512 --> 02:08:29.373]  We didn't plan this.
[02:08:29.373 --> 02:08:30.193]  I wish I'd have known about it.
[02:08:30.193 --> 02:08:31.954]  I would have supported it.
[02:08:31.954 --> 02:08:38.719]  Overpasses for Obama's impeachment nationwide protest are a huge success.
[02:08:38.719 --> 02:08:40.541]  We've got photos and video going up.
[02:08:40.541 --> 02:08:41.902]  Our reporters are out there right now.
[02:08:42.662 --> 02:08:48.029]  We had a reporter going home sick today and just saw these banner hangs impeach Obama over the NSA.
[02:08:48.029 --> 02:08:49.151]  Very exciting.
[02:08:49.151 --> 02:08:50.613]  That's the type of message to send.
[02:08:50.613 --> 02:08:55.239]  Greenwald says NSA supporters exploiting terror threats to kill Fourth Amendment.
[02:08:55.896 --> 02:08:59.359]  Yeah, that's like saying a bear goes to the bathroom in the woods.
[02:08:59.359 --> 02:09:06.425]  Dead of night, Amber Alert scares Californians where they take over your phones and TVs turn on now.
[02:09:06.425 --> 02:09:13.531]  It's like out of Poltergeist or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, but it's the government taking over your phones.
[02:09:13.531 --> 02:09:18.015]  Continuing documents reveal holders' travel expenses exceeded $4 million in four years.
[02:09:18.015 --> 02:09:21.398]  Feds visit Michael Hastings' house day before his death.
[02:09:21.398 --> 02:09:23.259]  That's from our military sources.
[02:09:23.259 --> 02:09:23.679]  He said he was
[02:09:24.591 --> 02:09:25.932]  Totally scared.
[02:09:25.932 --> 02:09:29.753]  This is a guy who'd been in heavy combat, in huge battles.
[02:09:29.753 --> 02:09:32.514]  They said they'd never seen a member of the press with that much courage.
[02:09:32.514 --> 02:09:35.635]  Yeah, because our evidence is Hastings wasn't who he appeared to be.
[02:09:35.635 --> 02:09:38.856]  He was probably CIA, but continuing.
[02:09:38.856 --> 02:09:47.300]  We're going to be looking at all of that and looking at the shame of foster care and some big developments on that front, but finishing up with the
[02:09:48.420 --> 02:09:49.822]  You were getting into the whole NSA
[02:10:11.002 --> 02:10:11.583]  I don't know.
[02:10:30.933 --> 02:10:34.437]  Yeah, you know, I like telling stories and analogies because they make it real.
[02:10:34.437 --> 02:10:35.658]  They make it bleed for people.
[02:10:35.658 --> 02:10:39.202]  You know, you have to make it real and material or else they don't feel like they're losing anything.
[02:10:39.202 --> 02:10:43.286]  What's going to happen is, one of these days, here's a scenario I'll paint for you.
[02:10:43.286 --> 02:10:45.829]  You're going to be needed in an investigation against your neighbor.
[02:10:45.829 --> 02:10:53.097]  Now, you've done nothing wrong, okay, but your neighbor, say, is involved in what they do, some terrorist act or whatever it may be, or something they deem national security.
[02:10:53.584 --> 02:11:06.336]  They're gonna come to you, they're gonna knock on your door, and they're gonna say, hey, here's a email you sent to your buddy Tony, whatever, 15 years ago, saying that you were gonna, you know, punch some guy in the face because he wouldn't move his car out from your house.
[02:11:06.336 --> 02:11:08.418]  Did you know that's aggravated harassment?
[02:11:08.418 --> 02:11:15.264]  And by the way, if you don't tell us what we need against your neighbor, the information, then you're going down for aggravated harassment.
[02:11:15.771 --> 02:11:17.712]  Now, you may say, oh, that sounds crazy.
[02:11:17.712 --> 02:11:23.716]  Really, it sounded crazy that they would target conservative groups with their IRS histories as well.
[02:11:23.716 --> 02:11:27.438]  Folks, you give the government information, it will be abused.
[02:11:27.438 --> 02:11:30.020]  I am telling you, it is just a matter of time.
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:31.021]  It is not a matter of if.
[02:11:31.021 --> 02:11:32.722]  And one more point on this, Alex.
[02:11:32.722 --> 02:11:37.485]  What makes America great is you decide when the private self and the public self
[02:11:38.205 --> 02:11:39.466]  That's already starting here!
[02:11:58.341 --> 02:11:59.902]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:11:59.902 --> 02:12:06.447]  When they have access to your information, when you open your garage door in the morning, when I do, I know the public self begins, okay?
[02:12:06.447 --> 02:12:08.748]  You know, if you're doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about.
[02:12:08.748 --> 02:12:09.109]  Nonsense.
[02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:10.249]  We're all doing something wrong.
[02:12:10.249 --> 02:12:10.930]  We're human beings.
[02:12:10.930 --> 02:12:12.291]  We're all fallible, okay?
[02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:16.674]  We decide, as long as your wrongs don't infringe on the civil liberties of others, you're left alone.
[02:12:16.674 --> 02:12:18.195]  That's the deal we have here, right?
[02:12:18.195 --> 02:12:21.037]  When I open my garage door in the morning, I know the public self begins.
[02:12:21.497 --> 02:12:24.140]  If you keep going down this road, you're going down now.
[02:12:24.140 --> 02:12:26.984]  That garage door is open all the time.
[02:12:26.984 --> 02:12:31.108]  There is no private you, and we are just like every other totality.
[02:12:31.108 --> 02:12:32.069]  Sure, sure.
[02:12:32.069 --> 02:12:32.430]  Exactly.
[02:12:32.430 --> 02:12:34.913]  We don't live in glass houses because...
[02:12:36.496 --> 02:12:38.736]  To be free, you've got to have privacy.
[02:12:38.736 --> 02:12:46.678]  Plus, this NSA grid and all these hackers they've hired, they're on record that they can plant fake stuff in your digital file.
[02:12:46.678 --> 02:12:51.659]  Or, if you're running for office, use a medical issue you've got against you.
[02:12:51.659 --> 02:12:54.600]  They're on record already doing this.
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:57.500]  I mean, take all the governors and people they found with hookers.
[02:12:57.500 --> 02:13:05.502]  And I'm not saying that's a good thing, but they were sitting on all that until they wanted to burn somebody when they were exposing banking corruption.
[02:13:05.942 --> 02:13:23.895]  And so, again, it's going to be used selectively, and that's the word I've gotten from Congress, and it's come out the cloakroom has been bugged, is that the Justice Department is using people cheating on their wife ten years ago, people joking around in an email saying, I want to kill my neighbor, or whatever.
[02:13:23.895 --> 02:13:26.657]  They are using that for blackmail right now.
[02:13:27.219 --> 02:13:30.542]  Right, the greatest commodity of Washington, D.C.
[02:13:30.542 --> 02:13:35.826]  is not the bankrupt Fed, it's not gold, it's information, folks.
[02:13:35.826 --> 02:13:41.131]  Information is the greatest, most valuable commodity you can have in the bubble of Washington, D.C.
[02:13:41.131 --> 02:13:45.334]  I promise you, you forfeit it and you give it up without a fight.
[02:13:45.334 --> 02:13:48.737]  I'm telling you, you're going to rue the day you failed to do something.
[02:13:48.737 --> 02:13:54.582]  Fight back, organize, do what you need to do, but you better get involved or you will regret the day, I promise you.
[02:13:54.662 --> 02:13:56.523]  Well, here's another analogy.
[02:13:56.523 --> 02:14:03.986]  We hear about these fools who would go on Facebook and say, I'm going to Cancun for Christmas.
[02:14:03.986 --> 02:14:05.187]  I'll be gone six days.
[02:14:05.187 --> 02:14:07.027]  Here's where we're staying.
[02:14:07.027 --> 02:14:11.009]  And the woman was, look, my husband just bought me a 10 carat diamond ring.
[02:14:11.009 --> 02:14:12.069]  The thieves are waiting.
[02:14:12.069 --> 02:14:13.390]  They know what hotel you're at.
[02:14:13.390 --> 02:14:14.791]  They've already cased you.
[02:14:14.791 --> 02:14:16.251]  They break in your room and steal the ring.
[02:14:16.251 --> 02:14:17.232]  That's a real case.
[02:14:17.232 --> 02:14:18.212]  Let's expand.
[02:14:18.212 --> 02:14:20.153]  You go, I'm going to see my grandma for two days.
[02:14:20.153 --> 02:14:22.094]  Look what I got for Christmas again.
[02:14:22.794 --> 02:14:25.836]  Where you live, the thieves come and break in your house.
[02:14:25.836 --> 02:14:27.897]  It's not that you've done something wrong.
[02:14:27.897 --> 02:14:32.720]  Bad people will use your lack of privacy to abuse you.
[02:14:32.720 --> 02:14:34.341]  There's a reason we lock our doors.
[02:14:34.341 --> 02:14:36.022]  There's a reason we pull our shades.
[02:14:36.022 --> 02:14:38.304]  There's a reason we have fences and walls.
[02:14:38.304 --> 02:14:46.369]  It's so that bad people have to go through something before they get to us and they don't have intel on us, rendering us defenseless.
[02:14:47.090 --> 02:14:49.432]  Right, and they come at you from two different arguments.
[02:14:49.432 --> 02:14:56.417]  A lot of these so-called, you know, Republicans who support this, they come at you from the, well, it's going to make a safer argument, which is nonsense.
[02:14:56.417 --> 02:14:56.877]  It's garbage.
[02:14:56.877 --> 02:14:58.559]  Again, it's investigative laziness.
[02:14:58.559 --> 02:15:14.331]  And then the liberal side comes at you from, it doesn't matter, the end result's the same, but they come at you with the argument that the anointed ones, as Thomas Sowell used to call them, you know, in his book, Vision of the Anointed, the anointed ones should run your life, should have access to all your information, because they're just so much smarter than the stupid people like us out
[02:15:14.651 --> 02:15:15.792]  Either way, it doesn't matter.
[02:15:15.792 --> 02:15:17.613]  The end result is the same.
[02:15:17.613 --> 02:15:20.134]  The personal you is never personal.
[02:15:20.134 --> 02:15:21.014]  It's all public.
[02:15:21.014 --> 02:15:26.217]  And again, that you might as well, that whatever, that flag doesn't mean to you what it means to me.
[02:15:26.217 --> 02:15:31.740]  If you believe my information is your information just because you say it's so, and you've declared it constitutional.
[02:15:31.740 --> 02:15:32.460]  It's not.
[02:15:32.460 --> 02:15:33.381]  Read the document.
[02:15:33.381 --> 02:15:37.123]  I assure you it's pretty clear on those, on those portions.
[02:15:37.123 --> 02:15:38.864]  Your personal effects should be secure.
[02:15:38.864 --> 02:15:40.044]  And right now, they're not.
[02:15:40.044 --> 02:15:43.566]  I'm not giving the key to my house to any government official for any reason whatsoever.
[02:15:43.646 --> 02:15:44.586]  Well, that's the other side.
[02:15:44.586 --> 02:15:50.167]  Look how secretive government's getting while telling us that we shouldn't have any secrets.
[02:15:50.167 --> 02:15:52.188]  It is incredibly transparent.
[02:15:52.188 --> 02:15:53.708]  Final question.
[02:15:53.708 --> 02:15:55.568]  Folks can go to your campaign and learn more.
[02:15:55.568 --> 02:15:58.389]  Foot soldiers there on the ground in Maryland.
[02:15:58.389 --> 02:16:02.909]  Absolutely got to get behind this guy and the person he's running against.
[02:16:02.909 --> 02:16:04.270]  Just absolutely needs to be defeated.
[02:16:04.270 --> 02:16:06.870]  Bongino.com.
[02:16:06.870 --> 02:16:10.711]  Another Ron Paul in the Congress, folks.
[02:16:10.711 --> 02:16:11.451]  In your gut,
[02:16:12.071 --> 02:16:14.013]  Do you think we're going to turn the tide?
[02:16:14.013 --> 02:16:19.819]  Because I know historically it's only when things get really bad that people finally get out of denial.
[02:16:19.819 --> 02:16:27.007]  Or is the tyranny so sophisticated and has known the awakening was coming that they've already organized themselves to be able to stop us?
[02:16:27.007 --> 02:16:29.069]  I mean, what does your gut tell you about this fight?
[02:16:29.602 --> 02:16:32.887]  You know, Alex, I'm always an optimist, and I've seen it.
[02:16:32.887 --> 02:16:33.427]  It's bad.
[02:16:33.427 --> 02:16:34.028]  It's ugly.
[02:16:34.028 --> 02:16:35.270]  It's ugly on both sides.
[02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:41.058]  But, you know, we've been through a lot, and I do believe that some divine providence has led this country to be so different.
[02:16:41.058 --> 02:16:45.485]  There's no reason we should be as exceptional as we are, other than the fact that there's
[02:16:45.965 --> 02:16:48.146]  There's got to be some heavenly intervention here.
[02:16:48.146 --> 02:16:49.346]  I think we're going to fix this.
[02:16:49.346 --> 02:16:50.327]  It's going to take some time.
[02:16:50.327 --> 02:16:52.588]  But folks, remember, it's only power in now.
[02:16:52.588 --> 02:16:54.768]  You have to do something, not talk.
[02:16:54.768 --> 02:16:56.329]  You have to get involved.
[02:16:56.329 --> 02:16:58.810]  If we're just talking, that's called whining.
[02:16:58.810 --> 02:16:59.850]  We have to get involved.
[02:16:59.850 --> 02:17:02.691]  I took a huge hit to my life to do this.
[02:17:02.691 --> 02:17:06.913]  I'm not asking for your sympathy or your sorrow, but I'm saying do something.
[02:17:06.913 --> 02:17:08.433]  Talk is not enough.
[02:17:08.433 --> 02:17:09.854]  So please, get involved and yes.
[02:17:10.394 --> 02:17:14.536]  I think we are going to change it because, listen, liberty should not be such a tough sell.
[02:17:14.536 --> 02:17:16.536]  Certainly hasn't been for me out there on the stump.
[02:17:16.536 --> 02:17:18.037]  We've really changed a lot of minds.
[02:17:18.037 --> 02:17:18.837]  That's right.
[02:17:18.837 --> 02:17:21.978]  People tend to over plan things and then rationalize.
[02:17:21.978 --> 02:17:28.000]  If you know it's right to stand against something, whatever it is, gut up, do it, whether it's small, medium or large.
[02:17:28.000 --> 02:17:30.321]  Little things grow into big things.
[02:17:30.321 --> 02:17:31.761]  Commit to freedom.
[02:17:31.761 --> 02:17:32.502]  Commit to
[02:17:33.482 --> 02:17:40.545]  American liberty that made us so great and we can go back to being a prosperous good nation.
[02:17:40.545 --> 02:17:53.090]  It's time for the good men and women who've been doing nothing to stand up and it's time people that have been doing something to redouble their efforts because we can clearly see where this road is going is not a good place when you turn this around.
[02:17:53.090 --> 02:17:55.991]  Dan, thank you so much for the time and I can't wait for you to get into Congress.
[02:17:56.391 --> 02:17:58.112]  Thanks Alex, it was an honor, I appreciate it.
[02:17:58.112 --> 02:17:59.313]  Thank you sir, goodbye.
[02:17:59.313 --> 02:18:00.594]  Alright folks, there he goes.
[02:18:00.594 --> 02:18:01.335]  That was a good interview.
[02:18:01.335 --> 02:18:05.017]  It was only going to be like 20 minutes long, but I held him to this hour because he's just a great guy.
[02:18:05.017 --> 02:18:24.551]  You can tell he's a great guy, and you can tell that he's got a lot of courage, and they're breaking into his house, they're breaking into his business, they're breaking into his car, they're messing with his wife, and all I can tell you is that I really worry about that because if I ever catch somebody physically threatening my family, I'm going to, I mean, it's just, it's over.
[02:18:25.607 --> 02:18:26.868]  And I think they know that.
[02:18:26.868 --> 02:18:30.412]  That's the one thing I've got to control myself with, with these people.
[02:18:30.412 --> 02:18:34.115]  I am so sick of the scum that have overrun this country.
[02:18:34.115 --> 02:18:34.596]  And you heard him.
[02:18:34.596 --> 02:18:43.805]  He said there are cliques, bipartisan, of technocrats and insiders and lobbyists and special interests that literally know what they're doing.
[02:18:43.805 --> 02:18:49.811]  And they want to block us from having them bankrupt the country so they can get even richer at our expense.
[02:18:51.018 --> 02:18:54.821]  They're putting a police state in so we can never get the country back.
[02:18:54.821 --> 02:18:59.525]  It is a conscious move, a conspiracy.
[02:18:59.525 --> 02:19:04.369]  There's thousands of charges per city a year of conspiracy to do this, conspiracy to do that.
[02:19:04.369 --> 02:19:06.470]  But oh, when government does it, it doesn't exist.
[02:19:06.470 --> 02:19:07.051]  No.
[02:19:07.051 --> 02:19:09.213]  There is a globalist, corporate,
[02:19:10.069 --> 02:19:14.891]  Conspiracy against common sense and against individualism and against the family.
[02:19:14.891 --> 02:19:17.492]  I mean, turn on television and the dramas and movies.
[02:19:17.492 --> 02:19:21.974]  It's all a bunch of anti-family, anti-male, anti-liberty bull.
[02:19:21.974 --> 02:19:29.037]  Because the only people that are allowed to be male are the people that work for the system and they're all super male, trying to dominate us.
[02:19:29.037 --> 02:19:31.938]  But then we're all supposed to just cower down here and run around in fear.
[02:19:31.938 --> 02:19:32.759]  Well, I'm not doing it.
[02:19:33.479 --> 02:19:34.160]  Okay?
[02:19:34.160 --> 02:19:39.644]  You get a double middle finger from me to the New World Order, and I'm sorry to talk like that, but that's what it comes down to.
[02:19:39.644 --> 02:19:40.906]  I am going down with the ship.
[02:19:40.906 --> 02:19:42.867]  I am not bowing to you murderers.
[02:19:42.867 --> 02:19:47.671]  Because let me tell you something, bowing to them is giving consent to all their crimes.
[02:19:47.671 --> 02:19:49.713]  And that's why I have no fear, folks.
[02:19:49.713 --> 02:19:56.259]  These people are hurting innocents all over the world, and I'm sick of it being done in my name, and I am not going to be part of it.
[02:19:56.639 --> 02:20:00.181]  I do not need those spiritual bowling balls hanging around my neck.
[02:20:00.181 --> 02:20:06.885]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've witnessed that a lot of illness can be linked to toxins and deficiencies combined.
[02:20:06.885 --> 02:20:13.389]  Improving your liver function and restoring your cells' ability to detoxify is essential to achieving radiant health.
[02:20:13.389 --> 02:20:17.572]  Listen to the real-world results of Doug and his wife after taking One World Way.
[02:20:17.572 --> 02:20:18.953]  My name is Doug Diderot.
[02:20:18.953 --> 02:20:22.015]  For years, I had an ongoing rash with itching around my eyes.
[02:20:22.015 --> 02:20:25.437]  This was due to metal dust particles landing on my face in the workplace.
[02:20:25.917 --> 02:20:32.605]  After being on One World Way for two weeks, I began to have a severe rash and itching sensation around my eyes.
[02:20:32.605 --> 02:20:38.032]  This rash and itching lasted for five weeks and is now 100% gone.
[02:20:38.032 --> 02:20:45.021]  Additionally, without extra exercise, I've also increased my muscle size and my wife has lost weight and gained a more attractive figure.

[02:22:29.222 --> 02:22:30.342]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:30.342 --> 02:22:34.824]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:34.824 --> 02:22:40.546]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:40.546 --> 02:22:42.707]  Gold has outperformed paper investments yet.
[02:22:42.707 --> 02:22:44.127]  No word about IRAs.
[02:22:44.127 --> 02:22:48.909]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[02:22:58.692 --> 02:23:03.476]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:23:03.476 --> 02:23:06.499]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:23:06.499 --> 02:23:15.467]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:23:15.467 --> 02:23:20.392]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:23:21.005 --> 02:23:32.377]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.

[02:23:40.064 --> 02:23:44.367]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:23:44.367 --> 02:23:47.969]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:23:47.969 --> 02:23:55.234]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:23:55.234 --> 02:23:56.495]  Protect your immune system.
[02:23:56.495 --> 02:23:57.536]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:24:11.340 --> 02:24:14.982]  You can run on for a long time.
[02:24:14.982 --> 02:24:17.963]  Run on for a long time.
[02:24:17.963 --> 02:24:20.765]  Run on for a long time.
[02:24:20.765 --> 02:24:23.266]  Sooner or later, gotta put you down.
[02:24:23.266 --> 02:24:27.488]  Yeah, we had Ron Paul on in the first hour with just amazing info.
[02:24:27.488 --> 02:24:31.270]  Calling the NSA liars, calling Clapper.
[02:24:31.270 --> 02:24:37.913]  And, of course, Alexander, the head of the NSA, a liar.
[02:24:37.913 --> 02:24:39.114]  Very, very powerful.
[02:24:39.114 --> 02:24:39.774]  And then we had
[02:24:41.141 --> 02:24:46.866]  Biggs on about how scared Hastings was before they killed him.
[02:24:46.866 --> 02:24:58.417]  And he'd been in heavy combat with him when they were in famous battles with hundreds of Taliban shooting at him and warthogs blasting them and helicopters and explosions right up, you know, all around them.
[02:24:58.417 --> 02:25:00.999]  People getting killed and Hastings was totally calm.
[02:25:00.999 --> 02:25:02.861]  Hastings was scared.
[02:25:02.861 --> 02:25:06.083]  And, you know, I get told what Hastings said and then I'm not allowed to say it.
[02:25:06.806 --> 02:25:07.947]  And it puts me in danger.
[02:25:07.947 --> 02:25:10.489]  I mean, it's not even a... The government's listening to the phones.
[02:25:10.489 --> 02:25:11.230]  They know what it is.
[02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:16.035]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[02:25:16.035 --> 02:25:22.941]  And, you know, you heard that former senior Secret Service agent who ran the Secret Service operations when Obama went overseas.
[02:25:22.941 --> 02:25:26.164]  I mean, that's senior, going up to the top of the ranks.
[02:25:26.164 --> 02:25:27.866]  And the stuff he saw, he had to get out of it.
[02:25:30.768 --> 02:25:37.154]  And you heard him saying, folks, you are so naive if you don't know this is a mafia criminal government bipartisan.
[02:25:37.154 --> 02:25:38.956]  You heard him on air.
[02:25:38.956 --> 02:25:40.137]  It is.
[02:25:40.137 --> 02:25:46.102]  So it's not some macho deal when I get up here on air and say this is what's going on and I'm going all the way.
[02:25:46.102 --> 02:25:47.804]  It's a decision you have to make.
[02:25:47.804 --> 02:25:52.388]  I am not living on my knees sucking boots of a bunch of thugs.
[02:25:54.005 --> 02:25:56.926]  And I want to tell everybody serving the evil system something.
[02:25:56.926 --> 02:25:59.407]  You're going to get bit in the butt by this.
[02:25:59.407 --> 02:26:12.511]  These tyrannies, if you study history, 100% of the time run wild and burn everything down politically.
[02:26:12.511 --> 02:26:19.174]  And it's just extremely frustrating to have all the numbers and the data and to know how all this stuff works.
[02:26:20.489 --> 02:26:23.790]  To just realize people hear this show and they think I'm nuts half the time.
[02:26:23.790 --> 02:26:28.210]  And I am a little eccentric because of all the stuff I know.
[02:26:28.210 --> 02:26:29.191]  It's done a lot of stuff.
[02:26:29.191 --> 02:26:30.691]  It's done a lot of things to me.
[02:26:30.691 --> 02:26:33.931]  I'm just a regular guy in person.
[02:26:33.931 --> 02:26:37.472]  But what I say on air is not half as bad as it really is.
[02:26:37.472 --> 02:26:42.873]  I mean, it's just... It's so unbelievable how evil the government is.
[02:26:42.873 --> 02:26:48.034]  And just the way it is chewing through everything now.
[02:26:50.734 --> 02:26:56.835]  And following that nightmare historical pattern that it always follows.
[02:26:56.835 --> 02:27:00.156]  It's travel route.
[02:27:00.156 --> 02:27:04.637]  And I'm just sitting here watching the travel route falling right to hell.
[02:27:04.637 --> 02:27:10.378]  And I see a lot of people waking up and that's good, but you just wanted to wake up faster so that we don't have to go down this road.
[02:27:10.378 --> 02:27:18.120]  I mean, I don't even want to cover this next story that I'm going to get to when we come back from break.
[02:27:18.120 --> 02:27:18.880]  But we got to do it.
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:19.400]  We're going to do it.
[02:27:22.062 --> 02:27:27.463]  Because it makes me think about all the other innocents that are crying out for help right now, crying out to God for help.
[02:27:27.463 --> 02:27:34.045]  And God, God tries to move the hearts of men and women to go do the right thing to protect these people.
[02:27:34.045 --> 02:27:37.746]  We are the hand of God, ladies and gentlemen, on this earth.
[02:27:37.746 --> 02:27:43.207]  We take the right direction, God will give us providence, but we are, we are the hand of God.
[02:27:43.207 --> 02:27:44.728]  God's hand works through us.
[02:27:44.728 --> 02:27:49.109]  And that's why we're in so much evil, is because we are evil.
[02:27:49.109 --> 02:27:49.629]  I am evil.
[02:27:50.985 --> 02:27:53.827]  I have not done enough.
[02:27:53.827 --> 02:27:58.329]  So that's why when I hear about new evil and stuff I feel like I've done it.
[02:27:58.329 --> 02:27:59.890]  I feel like I haven't done enough.
[02:27:59.890 --> 02:28:13.418]  I feel like when my instinct is to go even further against these people and am I being a coward and am I rationalizing to myself about how I prosecute this war against the enemy.
[02:28:13.418 --> 02:28:18.381]  And the fact that I'm human and joke around and goof off and stuff because I work too much and
[02:28:19.471 --> 02:28:27.373]  I can be a screwball, but you can't expect somebody who's been doing this 18 years to not have some idiosyncratic tics.
[02:28:27.373 --> 02:28:35.674]  It's like that Gnarls Barkley song, maybe we can come back from break with it.
[02:28:35.674 --> 02:28:42.836]  Yeah, I was crazy, not because I didn't know enough, it was because I knew too much.
[02:28:42.836 --> 02:28:47.777]  Briefly, before I end this segment and come back, we are listener supported.
[02:28:48.766 --> 02:28:50.486]  By spreading the word about the show, you name it.
[02:28:50.486 --> 02:28:54.888]  But also, InfoWarsHealth.com has the new Beyond Tangy Tangerine 2.0 discounted.

[02:29:33.762 --> 02:29:37.545]  But the point is, he's a very famous NFL player.

[02:29:50.836 --> 02:29:53.378]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.378 --> 02:29:56.061]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.540 --> 02:30:03.542]  Protecting your home with a security system is a must.
[02:30:03.542 --> 02:30:09.926]  But when it comes to protecting your family, your home, and belongings, there's no need to sign a long-term contract.
[02:30:09.926 --> 02:30:16.290]  Listen, there is some real scum in the alarm business cashing in by locking you into long, punishing contracts.

[02:31:04.119 --> 02:31:05.380]  Tyranny is here.
[02:31:05.380 --> 02:31:09.241]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:31:09.241 --> 02:31:11.703]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:31:11.703 --> 02:31:17.405]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:31:17.405 --> 02:31:24.088]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:31:24.088 --> 02:31:30.051]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:31:30.051 --> 02:31:33.753]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:31:34.233 --> 02:31:38.514]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:31:38.514 --> 02:31:44.476]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:31:44.476 --> 02:31:48.016]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:31:48.016 --> 02:31:49.997]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:31:49.997 --> 02:31:51.117]  It's here.

[02:31:59.878 --> 02:32:04.542]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression is over.
[02:32:04.542 --> 02:32:10.487]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high, and until Americans are working again, the economy has not recovered.
[02:32:10.487 --> 02:32:12.428]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[02:32:12.428 --> 02:32:13.049]  It's food.

[02:33:12.381 --> 02:33:13.181]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:33:13.181 --> 02:33:14.342]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:33:14.342 --> 02:33:15.662]  We're here Monday through Friday.
[02:33:41.837 --> 02:33:42.017]  11 a.m.
[02:33:42.017 --> 02:33:42.678]  to 2 p.m.
[02:33:42.678 --> 02:33:44.039]  Central.
[02:33:44.039 --> 02:33:55.467]  Back 7 o'clock weeknights with InfoWars Nightly News at InfoWarsNews.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:55.467 --> 02:33:58.069]  We also have the Mirror of InfoWars.com.
[02:33:58.069 --> 02:33:58.829]  It's not really the Mirror.
[02:33:58.829 --> 02:34:01.691]  It has a lot of original news on it, but a lot of the same.
[02:34:01.691 --> 02:34:05.134]  There's a lot of stuff that goes on Prison Planet that for some reason doesn't end up on InfoWars.
[02:34:05.134 --> 02:34:08.056]  So be sure to visit PrisonPlanet.com as well.
[02:34:10.836 --> 02:34:23.161]  I put a video out last night titled, Texas Town Kills Two-Year-Old Toddler Because Parents Smoked Pot.
[02:34:23.161 --> 02:34:30.845]  And if you watch the video, it's very, very clear.
[02:34:30.845 --> 02:34:35.587]  And I even made some notes this morning about what I wanted to say about this subject.
[02:34:36.953 --> 02:34:40.034]  Specifically, who took the child away?
[02:34:40.034 --> 02:34:41.354]  The state.
[02:34:41.354 --> 02:34:43.215]  Who paid for the care of the child?
[02:34:43.215 --> 02:34:44.195]  The state.
[02:34:44.195 --> 02:34:45.795]  Who inspected the children in the home?
[02:34:45.795 --> 02:34:46.756]  The state.
[02:34:46.756 --> 02:34:50.377]  Who wouldn't give information to the father when he said she was being beat up and hurt?
[02:34:50.377 --> 02:34:51.537]  The state.
[02:34:51.537 --> 02:35:01.880]  Why was the two-year-old baby, who'd never been to the hospital, never had a doctor's visit to be sick, who took the little girl away from the father and mother?
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:02.560]  The state.
[02:35:03.584 --> 02:35:12.990]  Because someone had smelled marijuana before, and so they went and visited the rest of the family, and reportedly the sister said, yeah, my brother smokes pot.
[02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:17.833]  And then the state came and said, oh, just give us the child, sign these papers, we'll give her back to you.
[02:35:17.833 --> 02:35:19.394]  Months later, that didn't happen.
[02:35:19.394 --> 02:35:22.536]  The poor father and mother still thought they were going to get her back.
[02:35:22.536 --> 02:35:24.837]  You don't get blonde-haired, blue-eyed babies back, folks.
[02:35:24.837 --> 02:35:29.020]  They can get a half mil for them.
[02:35:29.020 --> 02:35:31.642]  It's a hellish sentence for them.
[02:35:32.449 --> 02:35:38.373]  A lot of times they end up going at least to a nice family, but you better hope they get out of the foster care while they're lining that up.
[02:35:38.373 --> 02:35:41.656]  See, first they have to terminate the parental rights.
[02:35:41.656 --> 02:35:56.787]  And so if the parents are fighting to get their kid back, it might take a year till they're permanently gotten rid of, the names changed or whatever, or manipulated, the social security numbers, and then the child goes on to the next family in another state.
[02:35:56.787 --> 02:35:58.849]  And while they're warehoused, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:36:00.049 --> 02:36:02.450]  They die, and we have Justice Department's own numbers.
[02:36:02.450 --> 02:36:11.213]  You are seven times, even Time Magazine of all places has admitted this, more likely to get hurt or killed or abused in foster care than any other place.
[02:36:11.213 --> 02:36:13.954]  Does that mean there aren't some nice foster parents somewhere out there?
[02:36:13.954 --> 02:36:14.875]  Yes, there are.
[02:36:14.875 --> 02:36:17.396]  But by and large, and I cleaned carpets for a
[02:36:20.197 --> 02:36:23.118]  Summer, and so I've learned what are these places?
[02:36:23.118 --> 02:36:24.639]  These are these are foster homes.
[02:36:24.639 --> 02:36:37.023]  It'd be a regular house, just like you see in a neighborhood, but there'd be 10 kids in it, living on dirty mattresses, look like they're starving to death with some fat pedophile type pothead wandering around.
[02:36:37.023 --> 02:36:40.164]  I just say that because it always seemed to smell of marijuana.
[02:36:40.164 --> 02:36:42.185]  And you could tell these kids were not in a good place.
[02:36:42.185 --> 02:36:43.345]  They'd always look freaked out.
[02:36:43.345 --> 02:36:45.006]  There'd be cat piss all over the place.
[02:36:46.331 --> 02:36:47.332]  I don't know.
[02:37:04.540 --> 02:37:07.382]  I love going to nice fancy houses where you just move the furniture and cleaned it.
[02:37:07.382 --> 02:37:14.807]  A lot of times you'd go to a house where, you know, some dog had died locked up for a month and they were trying to sell it and they weren't going to jerk the carpet out.
[02:37:14.807 --> 02:37:15.368]  You'd have to clean it.
[02:37:15.368 --> 02:37:16.809]  See, I'm having flashbacks to that.
[02:37:16.809 --> 02:37:21.432]  But let's go to the Daily Mail article that came out after our article yesterday, but it got more of the photos.
[02:37:22.861 --> 02:37:25.423]  Let's look at this poor little victim.
[02:37:25.423 --> 02:37:38.311]  Two-year-old Alexandria Hill died on Wednesday, the 31st of July, two days after she was admitted to the hospital in Texas, north of Austin in Round Rock, suffering a serious brain injury.
[02:37:38.311 --> 02:37:46.536]  And she'd come for a once-a-week visit with her family with mildew on her, black eyes, hair falling out, beat up, begging to be with them.
[02:37:46.536 --> 02:37:51.739]  And boy, let's look at the troll below that for TV viewers who's been charged with bashing their brains in.
[02:37:53.263 --> 02:37:54.264]  Sherry Small.
[02:37:54.264 --> 02:37:55.945]  Man, I tell you, that's exactly what I saw.
[02:37:55.945 --> 02:37:57.086]  The men looked like that.
[02:37:57.086 --> 02:37:59.328]  The women looked like that.
[02:37:59.328 --> 02:38:00.489]  The foster parents.
[02:38:00.489 --> 02:38:03.852]  I mean, what I saw was bad.
[02:38:03.852 --> 02:38:06.174]  And these little kids needed love.
[02:38:06.174 --> 02:38:07.635]  They could tell if you were a nice person.
[02:38:07.635 --> 02:38:09.617]  They'd come over and try to talk to you.
[02:38:09.617 --> 02:38:10.657]  God, I've just seen it all.
[02:38:10.657 --> 02:38:12.239]  And let me explain something.
[02:38:12.239 --> 02:38:17.243]  If you're a good family and the neighbor lies and they come and there's dog hair on the floor, your kids are gone.
[02:38:18.530 --> 02:38:23.335]  If your child falls off a jungle gym at school and there's witnesses, your kids are gone.
[02:38:23.335 --> 02:38:28.600]  If your child falls and busts their tooth on the parking lot, your child is gone.
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:29.401]  In many cases.
[02:38:30.954 --> 02:38:35.557]  And there are real social services out there for old people that I know that do good jobs.
[02:38:35.557 --> 02:38:37.778]  They're trying to change that with the death panels and stuff now.
[02:38:37.778 --> 02:38:49.284]  There are some good overall family people, but the CPS itself has about a 50% turnover rate each year because people get into it for the right reasons and find out how evil it is and get out.
[02:38:49.284 --> 02:38:55.048]  It is a federal mandate to get more kids consecutively since Clinton got the legislation passed in the mid-90s.
[02:38:56.843 --> 02:39:01.504]  They grab over a million, 100,000 children a year in this country.
[02:39:01.504 --> 02:39:04.325]  And hundreds and hundreds of thousands get taken away.
[02:39:04.325 --> 02:39:05.406]  And I've seen it.
[02:39:05.406 --> 02:39:12.048]  If you're in a crack den with flies and feces all over you, they're not taking you.
[02:39:12.048 --> 02:39:16.369]  If you've got black hair and green eyes, you could be a brain surgeon doctor.
[02:39:16.369 --> 02:39:18.790]  They're going to take your kid.
[02:39:18.790 --> 02:39:23.231]  Raven hair, green eyes, there are people who pay millions for that.
[02:39:23.231 --> 02:39:25.212]  Blonde hair, blue eyes, the main target, half a mil.
[02:39:26.474 --> 02:39:27.635]  Okay?
[02:39:27.635 --> 02:39:31.859]  I mean, babies from China are hundreds of thousands.
[02:39:31.859 --> 02:39:34.142]  Babies from South Korea are hundreds of thousands.
[02:39:34.142 --> 02:39:36.704]  I know, my sister's adopted from Korea.
[02:39:36.704 --> 02:39:43.611]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, and the whole point here is, this is a bigger business than drugs.
[02:39:43.611 --> 02:39:47.035]  And DynCorp that's on record running child kidnapping rings.
[02:39:48.300 --> 02:39:52.865]  All over the world is the biggest CPS provider in Texas with their contractors.
[02:39:52.865 --> 02:39:54.967]  We haven't even looked at that yet, who she was contracted by.
[02:39:54.967 --> 02:39:58.730]  We know the front group, you know, the local group up there.
[02:39:58.730 --> 02:40:01.513]  So the worst place for children is in these people's hands.
[02:40:01.513 --> 02:40:03.915]  Let's get that straight.
[02:40:03.915 --> 02:40:07.279]  Now before I play this report from tomorrow night, I want to explain something, folks.
[02:40:08.809 --> 02:40:17.094]  If somebody's main line in heroin, the parents are better in almost every case statistically than in the hands of the CPS.
[02:40:17.094 --> 02:40:21.596]  So, the police, the judges, they all know it's a racket, and they all know this, okay?
[02:40:21.596 --> 02:40:26.459]  And they always use the crisis to get more funds and more CPS workers to grab more kids!
[02:40:27.366 --> 02:40:28.827]  FEMA screws up in Katrina?
[02:40:28.827 --> 02:40:29.648]  They get more funds.
[02:40:29.648 --> 02:40:31.189]  They screwed up on purpose.
[02:40:31.189 --> 02:40:32.970]  I talked to the head sheriff's people involved.
[02:40:32.970 --> 02:40:34.331]  They were told to stand down.
[02:40:34.331 --> 02:40:35.352]  FEMA came and cut the lines.
[02:40:35.352 --> 02:40:36.793]  They wanted that to be a screw-up.
[02:40:36.793 --> 02:40:41.536]  See, in America and under the globalist system, you screw up, you get more funds.
[02:40:41.536 --> 02:40:47.761]  They're all over the news, raising money for CPS and saying, title on more parents over this dead girl.
[02:40:47.761 --> 02:40:52.785]  They use everything they do to take more of our rights.
[02:40:52.785 --> 02:40:55.607]  And again, we've gone and gotten the affidavit and gone over all of it.
[02:40:56.897 --> 02:41:02.321]  Investigation started with a report of marijuana, then it turned into the child being taken.
[02:41:02.321 --> 02:41:13.871]  People don't know when you go to have a baby, and let's say you smoked one hit of marijuana a month before, they're going to test it in your blood, a lot of times falsely, and they're going to take your kid.
[02:41:13.871 --> 02:41:21.317]  I'll be in restaurants, I'll be at Martin Springs, this happens like every month now, and I have people going, yeah, they took my neighbor's kid because, uh, because, uh,
[02:41:22.403 --> 02:41:24.965]  You know, they tested her blood and didn't tell her, and they found marijuana.
[02:41:24.965 --> 02:41:26.406]  I mean, give me a break, folks.
[02:41:26.406 --> 02:41:28.627]  Marijuana's nothing compared to alcohol.
[02:41:28.627 --> 02:41:30.188]  I don't even smoke marijuana, okay?
[02:41:30.188 --> 02:41:31.870]  I have smoked it before, and I particularly like it.
[02:41:31.870 --> 02:41:33.711]  The point is, I've looked at the medical info.
[02:41:33.711 --> 02:41:35.292]  This is the persecution.
[02:41:35.292 --> 02:41:38.734]  You got over 100 million Americans that smoke marijuana on average once a week.
[02:41:38.734 --> 02:41:40.435]  Do they all deserve to have their kids taken?
[02:41:40.435 --> 02:41:42.497]  Because I'll tell you what really makes me sick.
[02:41:42.497 --> 02:41:51.023]  On the YouTube, and let's actually go to the YouTube page if we can, or I can go to it, of this video report I followed for the news last night that then got posted to YouTube,
[02:41:53.523 --> 02:41:54.384]  That needs to go viral.
[02:41:54.384 --> 02:41:57.908]  I'm going to send this back out on the real Alex Jones Twitter.
[02:41:57.908 --> 02:42:02.612]  It's got 863 likes, 20 dislikes.
[02:42:02.612 --> 02:42:06.496]  So people, the vast majority, understand what happened.
[02:42:06.496 --> 02:42:14.925]  But there are trolls in there that I tracked back that appear to work for the state of Texas and Williamson County because I did profile searches under their names, under their handles.
[02:42:16.323 --> 02:42:19.564]  They're in there going, good, take all the potheads, kids, they deserve it.
[02:42:19.564 --> 02:42:25.346]  Hey, listen, you may have this culture of hating potheads because it's like the demonized group you get to abuse and feed on.
[02:42:25.346 --> 02:42:29.147]  They're a good nonviolent group to put in your slave camps, to build wedges and stuff.
[02:42:29.147 --> 02:42:30.508]  I get that.
[02:42:30.508 --> 02:42:33.229]  And I get how corrupt Williamson County is.
[02:42:33.229 --> 02:42:40.451]  But this is a dead two-year-old little girl who was tortured pretty hardcore for months before she finally, mercifully, had her brains bashed out.
[02:42:41.903 --> 02:42:49.048]  We're going to go ahead and show people an image of her on life support, where they turned her off, you know, with the respirator.
[02:42:49.048 --> 02:42:51.991]  You people are sick.
[02:42:51.991 --> 02:42:57.154]  And Williamson County, with a lot of famous cases, is known nationwide as a really evil place.
[02:42:57.154 --> 02:43:01.077]  And they've told me years ago, if they ever catch me in the town, it's over for me.
[02:43:01.077 --> 02:43:02.018]  What, you think I'm scared?
[02:43:02.018 --> 02:43:03.479]  Go ahead and kill me.
[02:43:03.479 --> 02:43:04.220]  I'm not like you.
[02:43:04.220 --> 02:43:05.821]  I'm not a cowardly piece of crap.
[02:43:07.264 --> 02:43:09.266]  This man right here.
[02:43:09.266 --> 02:43:10.887]  This man right here.
[02:43:10.887 --> 02:43:13.849]  Texas Monthly, Michael Morton.
[02:43:13.849 --> 02:43:18.513]  I've been covering this case for a decade before it was a big national case or making a big movie out of it.
[02:43:18.513 --> 02:43:23.036]  He was wrongfully convicted in 87 and it turned out the prosecutors knew he was innocent.
[02:43:23.036 --> 02:43:23.497]  A father.
[02:43:24.522 --> 02:43:25.563]  No criminal record.
[02:43:25.563 --> 02:43:27.044]  Wife brutally tortured, murdered.
[02:43:27.044 --> 02:43:29.866]  They found the bloody bandana of the known serial killer.
[02:43:29.866 --> 02:43:33.168]  And it turned out they even knew once the guy was in prison, he'd admitted he did it.
[02:43:33.168 --> 02:43:35.450]  And Kat tried to keep this man in jail.
[02:43:35.450 --> 02:43:37.291]  They wanted to put him in jail because he was a good guy.
[02:43:39.727 --> 02:43:41.930]  And now they're getting ready to indict.
[02:43:41.930 --> 02:43:43.593]  That was in the news, that's in my stack.
[02:43:43.593 --> 02:43:46.617]  Michael Morton prosecutor will face criminal charges for withholding evidence.
[02:43:46.617 --> 02:43:47.499]  Boom, there you go.
[02:43:47.499 --> 02:43:50.443]  By the way, the judge that did all this is still up there right now.
[02:43:50.443 --> 02:43:55.471]  And this is going on all over the country, but let me tell you, Williamson County is like a satanic boss hog area.
[02:43:57.005 --> 02:44:02.348]  You got a bunch of naive snowbirds and people there, and then you got a wicked government, folks.
[02:44:02.348 --> 02:44:05.110]  So I recommend you no one go there or get near it.
[02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:06.630]  It's literally Mordor to the north.
[02:44:06.630 --> 02:44:09.472]  And Austin's got problems, but I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:44:09.472 --> 02:44:11.653]  Cops, you took a little girl.
[02:44:11.653 --> 02:44:13.194]  I don't care how much flak you throw up.
[02:44:13.194 --> 02:44:15.756]  Oh, and the CPS is like, well, they asked for our help.
[02:44:15.756 --> 02:44:19.998]  Once you came and said, we're going to help you sign these forms, and then they took the girl.
[02:44:19.998 --> 02:44:23.680]  They always try that PSYOP too, dealing with these liars.
[02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:24.901]  Let's go to my little report.
[02:44:25.988 --> 02:44:29.513]  Imagine you're a happy family living in Central Texas in a suburb of Austin, Round Rock.
[02:44:41.708 --> 02:44:53.915]  And one night you decide to smoke some marijuana after your two-year-old daughter's gone to bed while you watch a movie, something over a hundred million Americans are estimated to do every single week.
[02:44:53.915 --> 02:45:08.824]  A good secret police neighbor smells the marijuana, calls the police, and they come with the CPS and take your two-year-old happy daughter, who'd never been in the hospital, and never been sick, and never been beaten up.
[02:45:09.912 --> 02:45:21.157]  You go for weekly visits with your daughter and she's dirty, she's confused, she has black eyes, bruises, mold is growing on her body and her clothing.
[02:45:21.157 --> 02:45:26.139]  You go to the state and say she's being abused, help her, and they laugh at you.
[02:45:26.139 --> 02:45:31.942]  And a month later you get the call, she's on life support, her head has been caved in.
[02:45:32.918 --> 02:45:37.102]  Two days later they take her off life support and she dies.
[02:45:37.102 --> 02:45:48.152]  Another victim of this tyrannical government that we have that is incentivizing the states to seize as many children as they can.
[02:45:48.152 --> 02:45:51.155]  Over a million of them a year.
[02:45:51.155 --> 02:45:54.658]  The Justice Department's own numbers show the horrific facts.
[02:45:54.658 --> 02:45:58.642]  The most dangerous place a child can be is in state custody.
[02:45:59.918 --> 02:46:10.825]  Little Alexandria Hill, or Alex as she was known, will never get to grow up and be part of the spelling bee at school or the swim team or softball.
[02:46:10.825 --> 02:46:16.308]  She'll never get to go to college and meet the man of her dreams and have her own children and grandchildren.
[02:46:16.308 --> 02:46:16.809]  She's dead.
[02:46:17.788 --> 02:46:24.211]  Another casualty of this sick society we have that has the largest prison population in the world.
[02:46:24.211 --> 02:46:31.174]  Every authoritarian state throughout history has been obsessed with attacking the family and seizing children from their parents.
[02:46:31.174 --> 02:46:34.335]  Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia, Maoist China.
[02:46:35.592 --> 02:46:41.273]  But they never did it on the scale that we see here in the United States.
[02:46:41.273 --> 02:46:54.696]  And every day I see cases in Texas alone where people's children are taken for the most petty of reasons and end up dead, raped, tortured, killed, their heads caved in.
[02:46:54.696 --> 02:47:00.998]  The children disappear routinely and end up overseas in snuff films and pornography.
[02:47:01.938 --> 02:47:08.620]  Our children are one of the favored commodities of the criminals that run our government.
[02:47:08.620 --> 02:47:20.444]  And the people that are in control of Williamson County, Texas are famous for their abuse of the innocent and famous for their abuse of children that they've kidnapped from their parents.
[02:47:21.815 --> 02:47:30.678]  And I want to say something to the child predators in the police department in Williamson County and other areas in the United States.
[02:47:30.678 --> 02:47:38.060]  When we take America back, and we will, you will be tried for your crimes against humanity.
[02:47:38.060 --> 02:47:43.002]  You want to now charge one of the foster parents for supposedly caving this little girl's head in?
[02:47:44.142 --> 02:47:52.545]  You are just as guilty knowing how hellish those facilities and those homes are where they warehouse kids for money.
[02:47:52.545 --> 02:48:03.328]  You know statistically there are more pedophiles and more abusers who literally torture those children within inches of their life and that the state covers it up because it's part of a sick racket.
[02:48:04.108 --> 02:48:24.292]  And you need to know that it's all on your head, just like all the other cases in Williamson County where they've known people were innocent and known who killed people's wives and children and done nothing to prosecute the real criminals and gone after innocent people.
[02:48:24.292 --> 02:48:27.193]  You will be charged for that crime as well.
[02:48:27.193 --> 02:48:28.973]  And those charges are now forthcoming.
[02:48:29.833 --> 02:48:35.824]  And you will be brought to justice in Williamson County and everywhere else for the crimes you've committed.
[02:48:35.824 --> 02:48:41.675]  Your tyranny can go on for a long time, but sooner or later, God is going to cut you down.
[02:48:42.912 --> 02:48:44.633]  You shouldn't fear Alex Jones.
[02:48:44.633 --> 02:48:46.813]  You shouldn't even fear the American people.
[02:48:46.813 --> 02:48:52.175]  You should fear God because God is real and God is the law.
[02:48:52.175 --> 02:48:57.357]  You will be held in judgment for what you've done.
[02:48:57.357 --> 02:49:04.460]  All of you, the judges, the police, you are all accomplices in aiding and abetting the
[02:49:04.600 --> 02:49:05.100]  Thank you.
[02:49:17.369 --> 02:49:36.345]  For those of you who have only been passively involved in the industry that is the abuse of children at the hands of the state in this country, there's still time for you to admit the facts and go public and speak out against this evil and turn the tide.
[02:49:36.345 --> 02:49:46.053]  I will forgive you, the parents of the abused and dead children will forgive you, and most importantly, the creator of the universe will forgive you.
[02:49:47.173 --> 02:49:56.140]  And yes, even little Alexandria Hill, who is beyond your wicked grasp, will forgive you as well.
[02:49:56.140 --> 02:50:04.666]  Join humanity, and let us stop the modern slave trade in children that is taking place in this country.
[02:50:04.666 --> 02:50:06.648]  And finally, all of you out there watching,
[02:50:07.844 --> 02:50:13.528]  There are children being kidnapped for the pettiest of reasons in your town and in your city.
[02:50:13.528 --> 02:50:16.090]  Become an advocate for those families.
[02:50:16.090 --> 02:50:24.457]  Volunteer to expose the incredible miscarriage of justice where a Stasi spy neighbor smells marijuana.
[02:50:25.433 --> 02:50:29.596]  And a month and a half later, a little girl's head is bashed in?
[02:50:29.596 --> 02:50:36.542]  Did that family deserve to have their daughter killed in state custody because they smoked pot?
[02:50:36.542 --> 02:50:41.445]  Is that really land of the free, home of the brave?
[02:50:41.445 --> 02:50:49.031]  Or is it really a system designed to capture non-violent, non-criminal people in a parasitic system?
[02:50:49.031 --> 02:50:51.673]  I'm Alex Jones signing off for InfoWars.com.

[02:51:13.350 --> 02:51:18.953]  But did you know the Berkeys have had independent lab tests done to prove just how effective they are?
[02:51:18.953 --> 02:51:19.674]  It's true!
[02:51:19.674 --> 02:51:21.475]  And he can email you the test results.

[02:52:59.432 --> 02:53:02.115]  What's safer and cheaper than prescription drugs?
[02:53:02.115 --> 02:53:03.356]  Glad you asked.
[02:53:03.356 --> 02:53:05.718]  The answer is renovation teas.
[02:53:05.718 --> 02:53:09.922]  Herbal remedies are much safer and much cheaper than prescription drugs.
[02:53:09.922 --> 02:53:14.206]  Tastes great and most importantly herbal teas are effective and non-addictive.
[02:53:14.206 --> 02:53:17.069]  Renovation tea is especially unique and here's why.
[02:53:17.409 --> 02:53:21.210]  We spent years researching herbs and their beneficial properties.
[02:53:21.210 --> 02:53:25.852]  Renovation Teas uses only 100% organic, fair trade herbs.

[02:54:15.910 --> 02:54:24.480]  All right, the first I heard of this, and the story's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, Texas-wide, united we stand.
[02:54:24.480 --> 02:54:26.862]  That's just the Texas chapter.
[02:54:26.862 --> 02:54:33.970]  Chris Alanese, again today driving, and one of the producers of the radio show, and just said there's these big banners, people all over the highways, 183.
[02:54:37.628 --> 02:54:43.949]  I-35, we can roll for TV viewers some of that B-roll of what our reporters just went out and shot.
[02:54:43.949 --> 02:54:52.371]  And now we've got reports coming in of 1,700 people on the overpasses in places like Los Angeles.
[02:54:52.371 --> 02:55:01.753]  And again, just people all over the country going out there, nonpartisan, saying Obama, the NSA.
[02:55:04.463 --> 02:55:17.217]  Has been violating our rights and that the American people are going to stand up against this very very exciting and again when Alan he saw he saw big crowds out the particular one we went found only had a few folks out there that
[02:55:19.090 --> 02:55:26.115]  You know, we're basically protesting against it, but we're going to get compiled from all over the country for the nightly news tonight, the fact that this is happening.
[02:55:26.115 --> 02:55:31.058]  And one person holding up banners on an overpass will reach thousands of people, potentially.
[02:55:31.058 --> 02:55:35.241]  And when the news covers it all over the nation, it will be the idea of a nationwide movement.
[02:55:35.241 --> 02:55:43.487]  And the media is starting to pick up on it, with signs like, don't spy on us, and impeach Obama over Benghazi.
[02:55:44.775 --> 02:55:47.296]  And I just saw Gigi in the hall.
[02:55:47.296 --> 02:55:50.218]  She said they've got the report coming up tonight.
[02:55:50.218 --> 02:55:52.679]  1,700 in Los Angeles.
[02:55:52.679 --> 02:55:55.401]  And again, these are all over the city of Austin.
[02:55:55.401 --> 02:56:01.804]  What we're showing you is just spontaneous groups from the Internet going out there and saying impeach Obama.
[02:56:01.804 --> 02:56:05.406]  And people can say, well, why are you making it all about Obama?
[02:56:05.406 --> 02:56:09.108]  Because he's the front guy for the whole agenda, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:56:10.066 --> 02:56:15.147]  And if you can punish him, all the other rats and criminals that are under him will start running.
[02:56:15.147 --> 02:56:16.568]  But they're emboldened right now.
[02:56:16.568 --> 02:56:19.288]  They're like, we'll take your kids for no reason if we want.
[02:56:19.288 --> 02:56:21.249]  We'll give you forced inoculations if we want.
[02:56:21.249 --> 02:56:23.609]  We'll set up internal checkpoints if we want.
[02:56:23.609 --> 02:56:25.790]  We'll, you know, just on and on and on and on.
[02:56:25.790 --> 02:56:28.970]  We'll give $85 billion a month to foreign banks and tell Congress they can't find out.
[02:56:28.970 --> 02:56:30.891]  And we'll put the military under NATO command.
[02:56:32.131 --> 02:56:34.772]  Down the line, they're getting away with all of it.
[02:56:34.772 --> 02:56:37.413]  We've got to start pushing back.
[02:56:37.413 --> 02:56:40.554]  That's why they tried free speech zones and intimidation and all this.
[02:56:40.554 --> 02:56:42.915]  The answer to that is go out and protest more!
[02:56:42.915 --> 02:56:54.399]  And it's time for libertarians, conservatives, real peace activists, real liberals, who aren't authoritarian communists, calling themselves the left, to go out and demonstrate against this.
[02:56:54.399 --> 02:56:58.561]  Yeah, there it is, over 200 impeach Obama overpass rally scheduled.
[02:56:58.561 --> 02:56:59.041]  And that was...
[02:57:01.351 --> 02:57:02.752]  This is just kicking off.
[02:57:02.752 --> 02:57:04.674]  They're going to do more tomorrow.
[02:57:04.674 --> 02:57:06.896]  And look, you can do it on your own website.
[02:57:06.896 --> 02:57:08.818]  You can go organize your own protest.
[02:57:08.818 --> 02:57:10.200]  Get on Facebook, get on Twitter.
[02:57:10.200 --> 02:57:11.241]  People are angry.
[02:57:11.241 --> 02:57:18.788]  And say, who knows, we can even send reporters down to the Texas Capitol.
[02:57:18.788 --> 02:57:20.470]  4.30 today at the Texas Capitol.
[02:57:20.470 --> 02:57:21.951]  It's now been spontaneously announced.
[02:57:21.951 --> 02:57:22.572]  Where is that going to be?
[02:57:24.747 --> 02:57:25.188]  Okay.
[02:57:25.188 --> 02:57:27.189]  Oh, with the overpasses again everywhere in Austin.
[02:57:27.189 --> 02:57:27.830]  They're going to be doing it.
[02:57:27.830 --> 02:57:28.331]  Okay.
[02:57:28.331 --> 02:57:30.132]  I think the Capitol is important too.
[02:57:30.132 --> 02:57:31.434]  And call the press.
[02:57:31.434 --> 02:57:32.254]  Let them know you're out there.
[02:57:32.254 --> 02:57:34.617]  That's how you hijack the media, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:34.617 --> 02:57:35.658]  And will this save the world?
[02:57:35.658 --> 02:57:37.219]  No, but resistance will.
[02:57:37.219 --> 02:57:48.410]  This will start the ball rolling that we're not going to go along with this and we're going to use the Internet as a system to force the corporate state-run media to understand that we're fully aware
[02:57:49.634 --> 02:57:53.838]  of what they are up to and of what they are doing.
[02:57:53.838 --> 02:57:55.520]  This is historical.
[02:57:55.520 --> 02:58:03.708]  Again, I want to encourage everybody out there to also support platforms like this that is one of the biggest and most important liberty platforms out there.
