[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.880]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.880 --> 00:34.160]  the global crime syndicate is attempting to chart our future to sign
[00:34.160 --> 00:40.200]  humanity's destiny from my deep research they are the worst possible group to be
[00:40.200 --> 00:44.240]  trying to control human destiny in fact anybody historically that tries to
[00:44.240 --> 00:49.440]  control human destiny by force creates an absolute nightmare and with these
[00:49.440 --> 00:54.880]  globalist it is their conscious plan to create a dystopian nightmare they believe
[00:54.880 --> 01:00.000]  that they're creating a artificial survival of the fittest social Darwinism
[01:00.000 --> 01:04.680]  for our own good this is going to be another very important transmission to
[01:04.680 --> 01:08.040]  say the least congressman former congressman Ron Paul is going to be
[01:08.040 --> 01:13.620]  popping in at the bottom of the hour the former Secret Service agent who quit
[01:13.620 --> 01:19.080]  over the tyranny he saw in the federal government Dan Bongino is going to be
[01:19.080 --> 01:23.600]  popping in as well and Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs you know I talked at
[01:23.600 --> 01:30.120]  linked with last night and this morning is going to be joining us it was very
[01:30.120 --> 01:33.440]  strange I hadn't talked to him in a few weeks of course friends with Michael
[01:33.440 --> 01:37.520]  Hastings the mysteriously deceased it's not too mysterious now we know he's
[01:37.520 --> 01:42.280]  pretty much killed the evidence all points there Michael Hastings so I just
[01:42.280 --> 01:48.760]  put my children to bed at about 9 30 and I sent him a text and I said how are
[01:48.760 --> 01:56.880]  you doing how is Hastings wife doing and he said are you texting me because of
[01:56.880 --> 02:05.680]  CNN tonight she's on CNN with Piers Morgan and seems incredibly happy so I
[02:05.680 --> 02:09.360]  went this morning and watched it and it totally freaked me out he said he said
[02:09.360 --> 02:13.120]  reporters you name it Fox News calling him saying they thought it was very bizarre
[02:13.120 --> 02:20.560]  as well just smiling like she'd gone to the first Beatles concert when they
[02:20.560 --> 02:26.560]  came to the US and you know the women's eyes are just starry eyed people do
[02:26.560 --> 02:32.640]  weird stuff when they're uncomfortable but see that's the problem that's the
[02:32.640 --> 02:38.720]  problem she told Staff Sergeant Hastings and other of his military friends
[02:38.720 --> 02:51.040]  Hastings Joe Biggs that she was gonna bring down who'd ever killed him at the
[02:51.040 --> 03:01.240]  memorial and then when we were going to send reporters out there a few weeks
[03:01.240 --> 03:06.800]  ago she called him up crying saying please don't do it and so we decided to
[03:06.800 --> 03:12.080]  give her a few weeks she said I've got an investigation going I think you'll
[03:12.080 --> 03:20.480]  mess it up and Staff Sergeant Biggs can't even bring himself right now to
[03:20.480 --> 03:30.200]  call her up I don't know how much he's gonna say when he gets on air with us
[03:30.200 --> 03:38.080]  but there's a lot more to the story too and I tell you it's really hard being a
[03:38.080 --> 03:42.560]  journalist because I'm a political pundit I do analysis I rant I rave I
[03:42.560 --> 03:46.960]  guess it's entertaining sometimes as a train wreck but the reason this broadcast
[03:46.960 --> 03:50.640]  is successful is that we've proven historically to be very accurate and to
[03:50.640 --> 03:57.160]  be able to predict what's happening in the feet far out from an unfolding and
[03:57.160 --> 04:02.760]  because I'm real people people know that and they pick up on that but it is
[04:02.760 --> 04:10.840]  torture to be told things and then talk to other sources and confirm things that
[04:10.840 --> 04:17.840]  are just bombshell and then to have to sit here on information because you've
[04:17.840 --> 04:27.760]  not been authorized to release it that quite frankly is dangerous but they
[04:27.760 --> 04:36.080]  killed him you can bet your bottom dollar that you can bet your boots and
[04:36.080 --> 04:42.680]  we're gonna be talking about that coming up whenever I'm speechless folks is
[04:42.680 --> 04:47.640]  because I can't say what I know because I'm the type of guy that just goes with
[04:47.640 --> 04:52.240]  what they know and when I know something and I can't say it it's like
[04:52.240 --> 04:57.040]  having a frog in your throat we'll be back there's a lot more coming up stay

[08:15.240 --> 08:26.200]  Radio Network. What I know about the death of Rolling Stone journalist Michael
[08:26.200 --> 08:34.160]  Hastings has a lot of army rangers and regular army and special forces scared
[08:34.160 --> 08:45.680]  to talk looking out their windows at night looking under their cars it's one
[08:45.680 --> 08:48.840]  thing I guess to go to foreign lands and be engaged in combat because then the
[08:48.840 --> 08:53.400]  peer pressure says it's okay it's another thing to watch your friend's car
[08:53.400 --> 08:58.400]  blown up and know that federal agency visited Hastings the day before it
[08:58.400 --> 09:03.800]  happened and that he told his friends via telephone and email and said they're
[09:03.800 --> 09:10.680]  coming after me and all that's come out and then Pierce Morgan goes on TV last
[09:10.680 --> 09:15.240]  night and says it's a conspiracy theory and I want to queue that up when he
[09:15.240 --> 09:21.040]  starts to go to the widow and then calls it a conspiracy theory he says there's
[09:21.040 --> 09:24.560]  a lot of conspiracy theories he was working on a big story he said in an
[09:24.560 --> 09:35.760]  email my biggest story ever CIA they're coming after me they're gonna raid our
[09:35.760 --> 09:40.760]  offices get lawyers and then his car blows up and then now we have the
[09:40.760 --> 09:44.520]  surveillance footage of it going down the road explosion and then it goes off
[09:44.520 --> 09:47.640]  the road into the tree and that's what all the witnesses have said and the
[09:47.640 --> 09:54.840]  police tapes have come out and what I know I've told the radio listeners and
[09:54.840 --> 09:59.600]  no mainstream media will pick it up because they're controlled none of them
[09:59.600 --> 10:03.720]  will touch it except for some San Diego and LATV stations to their credit but
[10:03.720 --> 10:09.440]  no national media and his friends and family all know the feds were there and
[10:09.440 --> 10:14.040]  that's why they're so scared because I see the feds on the news saying we never
[10:14.040 --> 10:19.880]  visited him and then there's more about what Hastings said to friends and
[10:19.880 --> 10:23.880]  family and quite frankly people contact me with this info who are on record to
[10:23.880 --> 10:27.760]  be his friends and who are on record to get his last communications and then
[10:27.760 --> 10:32.240]  they're like yeah but we we can't go out public with this it's too dangerous what's
[10:32.240 --> 10:35.760]  dangerous is knowing this stuff
[10:38.560 --> 10:43.240]  I'm gonna play a clip from Piers Morgan but let me just show you if you're a TV
[10:43.240 --> 10:48.440]  viewer radio listeners can pull this up on infowars.com Michael Hastings's wife
[10:48.440 --> 10:55.600]  says suspicious crash was tragic accident Paul Joseph Watson
[11:00.000 --> 11:07.400]  Elise Jordan tells CNN that Rolling Stone journalist was on trail of hot
[11:07.400 --> 11:18.600]  story so to her credit the known government operative UK operative
[11:18.600 --> 11:21.920]  globalist operative Piers Morgan says it's a conspiracy that he was even
[11:21.920 --> 11:26.960]  working on a big story but let's talk about her for a moment because she told
[11:26.960 --> 11:37.120]  Staff Sergeant Joseph Biggs and others at the memorial crying that whoever did
[11:37.120 --> 11:42.200]  this was going to be brought down now since then she's clearly been threatened
[11:42.200 --> 11:46.480]  because hours after I had bigs on the show two weeks ago and I said I was
[11:46.480 --> 11:52.920]  gonna fly him and investigative journalist Wayne Madsen is an expert in
[11:52.920 --> 11:59.280]  investigating murder for higher top operations and other reporters infowars
[11:59.280 --> 12:05.160]  reporters in fact I was already pulling the trigger to go myself he calls up
[12:05.160 --> 12:10.440]  and says that afternoon well she called me up crying and then handed the phone
[12:10.440 --> 12:15.520]  to a friend saying don't do it don't do it don't blow my investigation please
[12:15.520 --> 12:19.760]  just give me a few weeks and then her friend said please just go with her
[12:19.760 --> 12:25.400]  wishes now let's talk about
[12:26.600 --> 12:38.600]  Elise Jordan let's go to her biography right here Catherine Elise Jordan born in
[12:38.600 --> 12:46.680]  Holly Springs Mississippi Jordan served as the director for communications in
[12:46.680 --> 12:53.120]  the National Security Council from 08 to 09 that is the shadow real government
[12:53.120 --> 12:58.040]  that runs the entire enchilada you can go to the bibliography there where it
[12:58.040 --> 13:03.160]  links directly through to the Atlantic wire and the White House in AP about her
[13:03.160 --> 13:09.800]  bio okay AP White House that's a fact that she was the director of
[13:09.800 --> 13:17.640]  communications or psyops for the White House office of presidential speech
[13:17.640 --> 13:21.800]  writing and the US Embassy Baghdad and for the commanding general strategic
[13:21.800 --> 13:26.200]  advisory group at the International Security Assistance Force headquarters
[13:26.200 --> 13:29.520]  in Kabul Afghanistan as well as speechwriter for Secretary of State
[13:29.520 --> 13:33.880]  Condoleezza Rice she also served as director of communications in the Naval
[13:33.880 --> 13:42.200]  Security Council before marrying Michael Hastings May 21st 2011 in
[13:42.200 --> 13:53.040]  Mississippi two years later mr. Hastings is dead now she's got some
[13:53.040 --> 13:56.720]  explaining to do and I understand she's a widow and our heart goes out there she
[13:56.720 --> 14:02.920]  had a child with mr. Hastings but she knows the feds came to the house in
[14:02.920 --> 14:12.520]  their lion and she knows that the Hastings works in on a big story and
[14:12.520 --> 14:16.400]  that his car blew up that's what the witnesses are now on record with the
[14:16.400 --> 14:19.680]  9-11 tapes confirming what other witnesses said it's going down the road
[14:19.680 --> 14:23.200]  it blows up the middle street then goes off the road into a tree that's what the
[14:23.200 --> 14:27.600]  surveillance footage shows boom an explosion underneath the car that's why
[14:27.600 --> 14:31.560]  the engine went blowing out the back the opposite direction because it's under
[14:31.560 --> 14:37.520]  the car probably in front of the engine
[14:37.960 --> 14:41.960]  ladies and gentlemen I don't like having to report on stuff but it's my duty
[14:41.960 --> 14:47.200]  you understand it's almost like slavery that I can't be an ego maniac and I
[14:47.200 --> 14:51.960]  can't be into just enjoying myself and being a narcissist and a nihilist and
[14:51.960 --> 14:56.000]  going and having fun I would love to go scuba diving in the Caribbean I would
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  love to go to the Smoky Mountains again I would love to go to Colorado I would
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.240]  love to go see really cool neat people I know all over the world I would love to
[15:04.240 --> 15:09.360]  take the offers you know to fly by private jet to the south of France I
[15:09.360 --> 15:13.760]  can't do it because I've got too many responsibilities I'm not up here saying
[15:13.760 --> 15:18.000]  I'm some goody two shoes oh aren't I great but I am risking my life bringing
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.400]  you this information because somebody's got to do it and my instinct is to tell
[15:22.400 --> 15:29.040]  the truth and stand up against this I just can't sit here and bow in fear like
[15:29.040 --> 15:33.480]  everybody else does that's why I just admire Staff Sergeant Joseph Pigs
[15:33.480 --> 15:36.920]  because the other army people he knows that were even better friends with
[15:36.920 --> 15:43.960]  Hastings than he they know all of it folks and they know what Hastings said
[15:43.960 --> 15:52.440]  before he died and you know I've just gotten the point of why am I even told
[15:52.440 --> 15:58.280]  this stuff and then I can't tell people about it I've already told over 10
[15:58.280 --> 16:03.560]  reporters about this and they by the way already know it's an open secret and I
[16:03.560 --> 16:08.680]  just can't believe oh he's been on some of my contacts have been on the phone
[16:08.680 --> 16:15.880]  with Fox News it's called him and others today everybody knows that the boat is
[16:15.880 --> 16:23.320]  sinking everybody knows the captain lied everybody knows the war is over
[16:23.320 --> 16:33.160]  everybody knows the good guys lost and then now the long winner sets in of
[16:33.160 --> 16:37.440]  slavery where now the criminals go yeah we're spying on everything you do yeah
[16:37.440 --> 16:40.780]  we're spying on petty crime with the NSA yeah we're watching yeah we're gonna
[16:40.780 --> 16:44.680]  take your kids whenever we want for no reason yeah we're gonna put poison in
[16:44.680 --> 16:49.720]  the water it came out in the news that oh Gardasil sterilizes women who would
[16:49.720 --> 16:54.120]  have thought something being pushed by Bill Gates would sterilize women really
[16:54.120 --> 16:58.360]  who would have thought they wanted for 11 and 12-year-old girls that are about
[16:58.360 --> 17:02.800]  to go into puberty I mean who would have thought
[17:03.680 --> 17:09.240]  we're just gonna let them do that to us it's I'm not gonna sit here and take
[17:09.240 --> 17:16.720]  this stuff okay where are the men in this country
[17:16.720 --> 17:22.480]  everybody is so scared well I'm scared of being scared I'm scared of living in
[17:22.480 --> 17:27.520]  fear let's go to this really creepy disconcerting unnerving that's the word
[17:27.520 --> 17:31.880]  being used by the media behind the scenes with the creepy British Intel guy
[17:31.880 --> 17:37.040]  Piers Morgan you know why I blew Piers Morgan because I was disgusted by my
[17:37.040 --> 17:42.160]  skin crawled he looked like a vampire in person folks he looked dead like a
[17:42.160 --> 17:47.480]  reanimated corpse well I'm not dead I'm not dead yet I'm alive and I'm not
[17:47.480 --> 17:53.400]  backing down my ancestors didn't and I'm not and civilization is built on men
[17:53.400 --> 17:57.440]  standing up to gangs and thugs civilization should be built on
[17:57.440 --> 18:01.400]  ingenuity and ideas and what you bring to the table not being a bunch of armed
[18:01.400 --> 18:08.280]  thugs feeding on populations I will not consign my family to slavery I will not
[18:08.280 --> 18:12.920]  sell out to evil let's go to this clip here's here's part of it the first time

[18:35.240 --> 18:39.200]  genuinely really happy there always are on these situations wild conspiracy
[18:39.200 --> 18:44.520]  theories that he was chasing some hot story maybe connected to that is late

[18:49.400 --> 18:52.640]  this do you have any idea really what you know I have no doubt that he was

[18:58.360 --> 19:02.600]  shadow government and he also there will be published his profile in the video
[19:02.600 --> 19:08.440]  coming issue looks like she just won the lottery but right now the invest the
[19:08.440 --> 19:13.280]  LAPD still has an active investigation I don't really have anything to add I you
[19:13.280 --> 19:17.720]  know my gut here is that it was just a really tragic accident and I'm very
[19:17.720 --> 19:21.720]  unlucky in the world was very unlucky yeah yeah he was a real one-off I mean
[19:21.720 --> 19:26.240]  that's enough so it goes on and on so the car is driving down the road and all
[19:26.240 --> 19:29.880]  the witnesses say it blows up and then into the air and into a tree and now we
[19:29.880 --> 19:33.160]  have video of it driving along and a big explosion in the middle of the street
[19:33.160 --> 19:37.280]  just like all the witnesses said now the 911 tapes are released which the feds
[19:37.280 --> 19:42.280]  fought to stop and and she told people at the memorial I'm gonna take down who
[19:42.280 --> 19:46.600]  did this so maybe she's putting a big act on so they think she's gonna shut
[19:46.600 --> 19:53.560]  up undoubtedly she's bare minimum been threatened but remember folks she worked
[19:53.560 --> 19:57.840]  for the highest levels of the real government in this country this is so

[24:26.200 --> 24:27.920]  all right John der Tractor
[24:27.920 --> 24:38.800]  You know what happens when good men do nothing, evil takes over.
[24:38.800 --> 24:42.720]  Thomas Jefferson said that.
[24:42.720 --> 24:43.720]  And it's true.
[24:43.720 --> 24:47.040]  Later in the broadcast, a story we put out yesterday that was picked up by the Daily
[24:47.040 --> 24:51.920]  Mail, foster mother Beats toddler to death after she was taken from biological parents
[24:51.920 --> 24:57.720]  because social services discovered them smoking pot and had talked to neighbors and family
[24:57.720 --> 25:00.320]  and said, oh yeah, sometimes the dad smokes pot.
[25:00.320 --> 25:05.000]  And so now the little girl's dead and a minority of people on the YouTube video I shot about
[25:05.000 --> 25:08.880]  this last night that's up on infowars.com and I've tracked back some of their handles
[25:08.880 --> 25:09.880]  and names.
[25:09.880 --> 25:11.480]  They're actually cops in Williamson County.
[25:11.480 --> 25:15.240]  They don't even hide that fact, you know, say, hey, you shouldn't be smoking pot.
[25:15.240 --> 25:16.240]  It's the law.
[25:16.240 --> 25:20.200]  So look, I know you got to say that so you feel like you're not part of this evil system.
[25:20.200 --> 25:23.160]  The government ships in the drugs, the hard drugs on record.
[25:23.160 --> 25:28.560]  They try to put kids on hard drugs in the schools, the pharmacological drugs.
[25:28.560 --> 25:32.800]  The truth is our government has more people in prison than any other government in history.
[25:32.800 --> 25:36.880]  The truth is our government grabs more children a year than any other government's ever done.
[25:36.880 --> 25:40.640]  The truth is it's a giant racket and we're going to have a special report on that after
[25:40.640 --> 25:46.160]  Ron Paul leaves us at the end of the shower or around a time it may be towards the next
[25:46.160 --> 25:47.360]  hour.
[25:47.360 --> 25:50.400]  Getting back to Michael Hastings, I want to explain something here.
[25:50.400 --> 25:55.080]  The feds did visit him a day before he did put out an email to about 20 of his closest
[25:55.080 --> 25:58.320]  friends saying, hey, if anything happens to me, they're coming after me.
[25:58.320 --> 26:01.600]  I'm going into hiding under the radar to release a big story.
[26:01.600 --> 26:05.400]  They're probably going to raid different offices, be ready, get lawyers.
[26:05.400 --> 26:06.480]  That's all public.
[26:06.480 --> 26:12.280]  First, they called it a conspiracy theory the first few days when we told you, okay.
[26:12.280 --> 26:15.680]  Now I've talked to his friends and others off record.
[26:15.680 --> 26:21.960]  Only Biggs, Staff Sergeant Biggs is willing to go on the record and he talks to other
[26:21.960 --> 26:26.200]  people that were at the funeral, the memorial, they're all scared.
[26:26.200 --> 26:30.360]  And obviously they know why they see the FBI on the news saying no feds visited Hastings
[26:30.360 --> 26:33.860]  and they know that's not true.
[26:33.860 --> 26:38.840]  Some of these people talked to Hastings that day and he said they're coming after me and
[26:38.840 --> 26:42.440]  then I go, well, you got to go on record and they're like, man, I'm scared.
[26:42.440 --> 26:43.440]  I got a family.
[26:43.440 --> 26:45.720]  These people kill whoever they want.
[26:45.720 --> 26:50.200]  Now look, the bigger issue here is, is anybody with a brain knows they killed Hastings.
[26:50.200 --> 26:51.560]  Now we have the video.
[26:51.560 --> 26:57.080]  The wife goes to the memorial and says in front of a bunch of his military buddies, I'm
[26:57.080 --> 26:58.080]  crying.
[26:58.080 --> 27:03.200]  I'm going to bring down whoever did this and she believed he'd been killed.
[27:03.200 --> 27:04.200]  She goes on.
[27:04.200 --> 27:08.080]  Piers Morgan looking like she was trying to win Miss America, you know, just radiating
[27:08.080 --> 27:10.640]  charm, totally happy.
[27:10.640 --> 27:13.640]  You know, oh, yeah, this is great.
[27:13.640 --> 27:14.640]  Yeah.
[27:14.640 --> 27:18.200]  The conspiracy theorist, a 180 folks.
[27:18.200 --> 27:28.160]  So if it is charming beauty queen wife is an actress, she deserves Oscars.
[27:28.160 --> 27:30.880]  I mean, I just don't know what to say.
[27:30.880 --> 27:34.360]  Was it acting when she cried and said, I'll bring these people down or was this acting?
[27:34.360 --> 27:39.880]  All I know is something stinks under the floorboards.
[27:39.880 --> 27:42.400]  What help us is all I can say at this point.
[27:42.400 --> 27:46.920]  This is the type of thing that really freaks me out and makes me hate my job because honor
[27:46.920 --> 27:47.920]  dictates.
[27:47.920 --> 27:53.440]  I tell the truth and I go out and I expose this and where it leads is really, really shakes
[27:53.440 --> 27:57.680]  my confidence in humanity.
[27:57.680 --> 28:00.560]  I mean, my God, if we'll sell out our own families, ladies and gentlemen, we'll sell
[28:00.560 --> 28:01.560]  anybody out.
[28:01.560 --> 28:05.360]  That's one thing these contractors brag, you know, they'll kill their own mother if they're
[28:05.360 --> 28:06.360]  told to do it.
[28:06.360 --> 28:08.560]  Oh, that's real manly.
[28:08.560 --> 28:09.560]  That's real tough.
[28:09.560 --> 28:11.800]  The kids have your order to that's real tough.
[28:11.800 --> 28:18.760]  Now, the truth is you're a bunch of gang member cowards that do whatever you're told and it's
[28:18.760 --> 28:19.760]  really shameful.
[28:19.760 --> 28:23.920]  This is the stuff that North Korea is made of Sergeant Big standing up and telling the
[28:23.920 --> 28:28.320]  truth is the stuff that America and freedom and everything good is made of.
[28:28.320 --> 28:32.640]  So we're going to be continuing to scan all this and we're getting to the point where
[28:32.640 --> 28:33.960]  it's all come out now.
[28:33.960 --> 28:37.680]  The footage, what happened, the witnesses, they blew his car up.
[28:37.680 --> 28:40.280]  No need to even go out to California.
[28:40.280 --> 28:41.560]  And I guess the system doesn't care now.
[28:41.560 --> 28:45.840]  They just want you to know, we'll kill whoever we want, whenever we want.
[28:45.840 --> 28:46.840]  End of story.
[28:46.840 --> 28:51.960]  And it's just an open secret and all the reporters I talked to know it and know what I know.
[28:51.960 --> 28:53.560]  And it's like, yeah, everybody's scared.
[28:53.560 --> 28:55.000]  So we're a nation of cowards.
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.800]  Well, my listeners aren't cowards and I'm not a coward.
[28:57.800 --> 28:59.040]  We're taking action against this evil.

[32:56.920 --> 33:24.880]  Privateinternetaccess.com today.
[33:26.920 --> 33:44.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are joined live with former congressman Dr. Ron Paul, really the
[33:44.880 --> 33:51.760]  grandfather of the modern liberty movement here in the United States and worldwide, worldwide
[33:51.760 --> 33:56.360]  across the planet from Asia to Europe, from Africa to Latin America to here in North America.
[33:56.360 --> 34:02.120]  People look to Ron Paul as the answer to the collectivist Borg and they are letting us
[34:02.120 --> 34:06.640]  announce something big today about the new TV channel they're going to be launching.
[34:06.640 --> 34:09.200]  I'm told that this was supposed to launch tomorrow, but they're actually going to be
[34:09.200 --> 34:10.200]  announcing it today.
[34:10.200 --> 34:15.920]  We've got them for about 15, 20 minutes, but the congressman joins us to get into foreign
[34:15.920 --> 34:20.880]  policy, the meltdown to the Middle East, the funding of Al Qaeda openly.
[34:20.880 --> 34:24.720]  I'm going to get into the Federal Reserve and what's happening with the bonds right
[34:24.720 --> 34:32.120]  now, billions being lost a day, and we're also going to look at the things that Ron
[34:32.120 --> 34:36.120]  Paul, myself and others have talked about for decades and that we were ridiculed for
[34:36.120 --> 34:38.120]  why it's all mainstream news now.
[34:38.120 --> 34:39.880]  So do we get any credit?
[34:39.880 --> 34:42.160]  No, we get attacked even more.
[34:42.160 --> 34:44.280]  Dr. Paul, thanks for coming on with us.
[34:44.280 --> 34:45.920]  Good to be with you again.
[34:45.920 --> 34:47.560]  Wow, so much is happening.
[34:47.560 --> 34:51.160]  First and foremost, you told him so again on foreign policy.
[34:51.160 --> 34:52.160]  What's happening there?
[34:52.160 --> 34:55.480]  Well, same old things only worse.
[34:55.480 --> 35:00.360]  The whole idea that we continue to finance our enemies and our friends and then our friends
[35:00.360 --> 35:05.280]  become our enemy and nobody knows whose side they're on, that's why the argument for a
[35:05.280 --> 35:09.680]  non-interventionist foreign policy is so good because there's always this flip-flopping.
[35:09.680 --> 35:15.800]  We support dictators for years and years and spend billions of dollars, and then, of course,
[35:15.800 --> 35:19.720]  when we get tired of them or they turn on us, then we look for a new dictator.
[35:19.720 --> 35:25.080]  So this craziness in Egypt, we demand that they have an election, and they elect somebody
[35:25.080 --> 35:30.120]  we don't like, so then we have to send the weapons to the military, and then they have
[35:30.120 --> 35:31.640]  a military coup.
[35:31.640 --> 35:37.800]  So it goes on and on, and right now, of course, one of the big issues is whether or not we'll
[35:37.800 --> 35:45.120]  get to the bottom of the truth on Benghazi, but it shouldn't take too much of intelligence
[35:45.120 --> 35:49.400]  to figure out that our CIA is just about every place in the world, and they were very much
[35:49.400 --> 35:50.400]  involved.
[35:50.400 --> 35:54.600]  But if we have the direct evidence that they were in Benghazi, and one of the reasons our
[35:54.600 --> 35:59.680]  ambassador was there because he was sending weapons directly to a group of people that
[35:59.680 --> 36:07.680]  we wanted to throw over Assad in Syria, but the foolishness is that we send it to al-Qaeda.
[36:07.680 --> 36:12.640]  At one time, they're our arch-enemy, they're wanting to kill us, but then we turn around
[36:12.640 --> 36:15.320]  and we've done that in Afghanistan.
[36:15.320 --> 36:20.920]  We've sent money to the Taliban and sort of bribed them to give us protection, and then
[36:20.920 --> 36:25.640]  we get our weapons through, and then they go and fight and kill each other.
[36:25.640 --> 36:33.040]  So I think it's ongoing, it's very foolish, and it's really a big issue in a way our country
[36:33.040 --> 36:34.280]  has become bankrupt, too.
[36:34.280 --> 36:39.560]  Well, it's almost like a snake eating its tail, because Janet Napolitano, outgoing
[36:39.560 --> 36:45.040]  head of Homeland Security, says four years ago, oh, the new threats, gun owners, libertarians,
[36:45.040 --> 36:51.760]  anti-war people, basically anybody with a political view outside of Washington Orthodoxy,
[36:51.760 --> 36:55.320]  and that's the new threat, and then they say al-Qaeda's not the threat, they're helping
[36:55.320 --> 36:59.560]  us in Libya and Syria, then they say, oh, we've got to shut down all the embassies, and even
[36:59.560 --> 37:07.880]  the New York Times today admits that basically they put out these terror alerts to distract
[37:07.880 --> 37:09.640]  from the NSA news.
[37:09.640 --> 37:11.560]  That is simply amazing.
[37:11.560 --> 37:18.720]  How long can this disjointed, helter-skelter narrative continue to work, or is it not working
[37:18.720 --> 37:19.720]  now?
[37:19.720 --> 37:24.720]  Well, it's not amazing that this is the truth, it's amazing, I think the New York Times would
[37:24.720 --> 37:31.320]  admit it, but I think most of us, when we saw that and all the NSA was on the defense
[37:31.320 --> 37:36.160]  that they were closing its embassy, they say, oh, there was 50 tax plans, we just saved
[37:36.160 --> 37:42.840]  the country from it to prove that they're souping and all the spying on American tests
[37:42.840 --> 37:49.040]  are good, but they claim successes, they're all built on lies, and you heard the story
[37:49.040 --> 37:57.240]  where the testimony was that, yes, there were 54 saves that they prevented from happening,
[37:57.240 --> 38:06.600]  and then when they talked to the assistant NSA official, he says, oh, no, maybe one,
[38:06.600 --> 38:08.000]  but I even doubt that.
[38:08.000 --> 38:16.280]  So it's all based on lies, and I think this is probably a benefit to us that most Americans
[38:16.280 --> 38:21.840]  now are becoming very, very leery of what our government tells us, and it's a terrible
[38:21.840 --> 38:26.480]  thing to have to go through because who wants to give up on their country?
[38:26.480 --> 38:30.400]  We don't want to give up on our country, but I think it's high time we gave up on a lot
[38:30.400 --> 38:33.320]  of our politicians and the way our government's being run.
[38:33.320 --> 38:37.200]  Again, former Congressman Ron Paul joins us here today.
[38:37.200 --> 38:46.000]  What do you make of the head of national intelligence clapper saying to Congress, we don't gather
[38:46.000 --> 38:51.360]  data on Americans when it's on record, they do, and then General Alexander, the head of
[38:51.360 --> 38:56.040]  cyber security and the NSA, makes the same statement, and then later admits that wasn't
[38:56.040 --> 39:00.240]  true either, but then he went to the Black Hat conference last week and repeated the
[39:00.240 --> 39:05.880]  lie again, I mean, it seems like a new level of deception, I'm going to play a few of those
[39:05.880 --> 39:09.240]  clips in a moment, but I'm sure you saw those in the last few weeks.
[39:09.240 --> 39:11.400]  What do you make of this?
[39:11.400 --> 39:17.840]  I try to understand it first, and I don't think it's a moral issue for them, if it becomes
[39:17.840 --> 39:23.400]  a moral issue, they reverse things and say they are morally responsible for taking care
[39:23.400 --> 39:25.440]  of you and being to protect us.
[39:25.440 --> 39:30.680]  They don't understand that they're moral responsibilities to provide and protect our liberties, but
[39:30.680 --> 39:37.200]  they actually brainwash themselves into believing that they have an obligation to lie, the noble
[39:37.200 --> 39:42.760]  lie, we're smart, people are stupid, we have to take care of them.
[39:42.760 --> 39:47.520]  The whole notion of welfareism is based on the fact that people won't take care of themselves
[39:47.520 --> 39:51.920]  and it ends up as a monster because of all the corporations and the banks to get the
[39:51.920 --> 39:52.920]  benefit.
[39:52.920 --> 40:01.560]  Yes, they believe themselves that this is true, so they are lying, and the other reason
[40:01.560 --> 40:08.320]  I think you can expect these lies is when you have tyranny, it's based on lies.
[40:08.320 --> 40:13.520]  If you have truth tellers, it challenges the empire, and that is why they come down very,
[40:13.520 --> 40:15.680]  very hard on a whistleblower.
[40:15.680 --> 40:20.760]  They have to really make examples of them, even if what they have revealed has done no
[40:20.760 --> 40:26.720]  harm other than tell the American people, and then they turn around and they say, well,
[40:26.720 --> 40:30.400]  we've got to punish them because they've turned this information over to our enemies.
[40:30.400 --> 40:36.760]  Well, Snowden and Manning turned the information over to the American people, so I guess there's
[40:36.760 --> 40:42.240]  some people in our government that think we're the enemy and not some other country.
[40:42.240 --> 40:43.240]  Absolutely.
[40:43.240 --> 40:47.040]  If people claim they're Americans, constitutionalists, and that they support our system, it's been
[40:47.040 --> 40:50.520]  proven to be the best one out there historically, hands down.
[40:50.520 --> 40:55.840]  And you know that tyrants try to spy on you in the name of your security, but it always
[40:55.840 --> 41:00.600]  ends up turning into an oppressive tyranny, generally by design, but it always regardless,
[41:00.600 --> 41:03.080]  even with good intentions, goes bad.
[41:03.080 --> 41:06.080]  And then now they turn it around, we've got to violate your rights.
[41:06.080 --> 41:11.980]  Our responsibility is to take your freedoms away, and how dare you try to keep us from
[41:11.980 --> 41:19.760]  protecting you, and then an incredibly transparent, fake terror alert, even Governor Ridge admitted
[41:19.760 --> 41:24.280]  in his book a few years ago that under Bush they would issue fake terror alerts.
[41:24.280 --> 41:29.680]  In case Lister didn't hear this, here's Clapper and then Alexander, his counterpart, saying
[41:29.680 --> 41:31.480]  they don't spy on the American people.
[41:31.480 --> 41:32.480]  Here it is.
[41:32.480 --> 41:38.760]  Could you give me a yes or no answer to the question, does the NSA collect any type of
[41:38.760 --> 41:44.840]  data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans?
[41:44.840 --> 41:46.720]  No, sir.
[41:46.720 --> 41:49.320]  It does not.
[41:49.320 --> 41:54.040]  Katherine Harris, Fox News Channel, thanks for taking my question.
[41:54.040 --> 41:58.360]  Will the Utah data center hold the data of American citizens?
[41:58.360 --> 41:59.360]  No.
[41:59.360 --> 42:02.640]  All right, that's enough.
[42:02.640 --> 42:03.640]  Part one.
[42:03.640 --> 42:07.800]  Going back to Ron Paul, a doctor, I mean, this is ridiculous.
[42:07.800 --> 42:10.800]  Did you watch them on TV when they were saying that?
[42:10.800 --> 42:17.480]  If you don't have to be an expert psychiatrist to look at them and look at their faces and
[42:17.480 --> 42:21.040]  their eyes, you could tell they were lying through their teeth.
[42:21.040 --> 42:24.560]  It looks like when my children, they don't do it much, but I've caught them lying about
[42:24.560 --> 42:25.720]  stealing cookies.
[42:25.720 --> 42:29.840]  It looks exactly like when my daughters eat all the cookies and lie about it.
[42:29.840 --> 42:32.440]  Yeah, I think that is.
[42:32.440 --> 42:36.520]  They knew darn well, but once again, lying for them if you can get away with it.
[42:36.520 --> 42:39.200]  I guess they've gone away with it for so long.
[42:39.200 --> 42:44.320]  Just think how many wars have been fought over lives, how they maneuver us into war.
[42:44.320 --> 42:45.880]  WMDs, all of it.
[42:45.880 --> 42:52.680]  So if they can do that and lose no sleep over it, kind of a little lie here and there about
[42:52.680 --> 42:58.320]  how much spying they're doing, they probably consider these minor laws and minor lies compared
[42:58.320 --> 43:01.480]  to what we've been told in the past.
[43:01.480 --> 43:02.480]  Absolutely.
[43:02.480 --> 43:07.080]  Congressman, I want to shift gears into your son because it's a big national issue.
[43:07.080 --> 43:13.240]  I've got to say that he just continues to impress everybody in the Liberty Movement,
[43:13.240 --> 43:15.760]  but he so definitely handles all these attacks.
[43:15.760 --> 43:19.080]  He has Joe Biden coming out against him in private meetings saying he's got to be dealt
[43:19.080 --> 43:20.080]  with.
[43:20.080 --> 43:21.520]  He's got Chris Christie coming out.
[43:21.520 --> 43:25.780]  He's got the president coming out against him, Carl Rove coming out against him.
[43:25.780 --> 43:30.200]  When the entire establishment is lining up against somebody, you know they're good.
[43:30.200 --> 43:34.560]  And the way he's really trying to defund the foreign bribery, the foreign aid, the way
[43:34.560 --> 43:39.680]  he's standing up against drones, I tell you, what is your take on them all lining up to
[43:39.680 --> 43:40.920]  shoot down Rand Paul?
[43:40.920 --> 43:45.880]  Well, it's a pretty good indication that he's probably on the right track.
[43:45.880 --> 43:53.280]  When all the bad guys gang up on you, it sorts it all out because there's a few Republicans
[43:53.280 --> 43:59.520]  that do it too and a lot of Democrats, but the leadership of both parties can't stand
[43:59.520 --> 44:02.840]  any of us because they are about one party.
[44:02.840 --> 44:07.320]  They pretend there's a great deal of difference, but if we reveal the truth, how many in the
[44:07.320 --> 44:14.920]  establishment Republican or Democrat would even consider anything we say about giving
[44:14.920 --> 44:21.320]  Bradley Manning a fair trial or Snowden a fair shake, they're not going to do it.
[44:21.320 --> 44:28.080]  And this is, I think people are beginning to realize because the information is getting
[44:28.080 --> 44:31.760]  out a little bit differently now than it used to get out.
[44:31.760 --> 44:34.720]  We got 100% of our news from the three majors.
[44:34.720 --> 44:35.720]  That doesn't happen anymore.
[44:35.720 --> 44:40.160]  I've only got a few minutes left with you and former Congressman Ron Paul joins us.
[44:40.160 --> 44:43.080]  I want to talk about the big announcement that you're going to make here on the show,
[44:43.080 --> 44:45.080]  I guess a day early, we're honored.
[44:45.080 --> 44:52.080]  But first off, looking at the future here, as you said, there's new media, there's alternative
[44:52.080 --> 44:56.360]  media, the numbers show in the aggregate, we're bigger than the old media, the state
[44:56.360 --> 45:03.080]  run media, drudgereport.com, infowars.com, the constellation of sites that Ron Paul who's
[45:03.080 --> 45:04.080]  joining us has.
[45:04.080 --> 45:08.320]  I mean, overall, they've got metrics out there, we're now bigger than they are, but
[45:08.320 --> 45:13.000]  they can still unify and kind of regurgitate the same news.
[45:13.000 --> 45:17.640]  And then sometimes we even kind of get caught up in debating whatever talking point they've
[45:17.640 --> 45:18.640]  put out.
[45:18.640 --> 45:24.240]  But short-term, mid-term, long-term, what do you see in your historical crystal ball
[45:24.240 --> 45:25.640]  looking forward?
[45:25.640 --> 45:28.520]  How do you think this is going to go for the establishment?
[45:28.520 --> 45:30.120]  Because they are losing the people.
[45:30.120 --> 45:33.960]  Just last week the Pentagon came out and admitted that they've got to stop lying to the people
[45:33.960 --> 45:35.400]  and said they're losing.
[45:35.400 --> 45:37.360]  And the papers are fading quickly.
[45:37.360 --> 45:44.520]  The Globe and the Post, they're the old media, there's no doubt about it.
[45:44.520 --> 45:47.280]  So I have two thoughts on that.
[45:47.280 --> 45:51.760]  One, I brag about it, compliment young people because they're attracted to it.
[45:51.760 --> 45:57.880]  We were able to win very successful campaigns and organize a lot of people through the internet.
[45:57.880 --> 46:03.240]  At the same time, we know technology is always advancing.
[46:03.240 --> 46:08.200]  But I think the question boils down, will the technology advance so quickly that our
[46:08.200 --> 46:12.560]  government can neutralize us and know everything that we're doing with the internet and cancel
[46:12.560 --> 46:14.640]  it out when we make use of it?
[46:14.640 --> 46:20.280]  Or will we be able to get around them and be able to have our own protection about government
[46:20.280 --> 46:21.520]  invasion?
[46:21.520 --> 46:24.200]  Or some alternatives to become internationalized?
[46:24.200 --> 46:29.440]  I don't know these techniques, but it's going to be technological because the government
[46:29.440 --> 46:32.240]  is not going to go away quietly.
[46:32.240 --> 46:36.640]  They will have to admit one of these days that the days of the three majors dictating
[46:36.640 --> 46:42.080]  everything to us are over, that the access to the internet and what we're trying to do
[46:42.080 --> 46:46.800]  with our new programming, I think is a real challenge to them.
[46:46.800 --> 46:52.200]  But under the conditions of today, that's what we have and we have to make the best of it.
[46:52.200 --> 46:53.200]  Incredibly said.
[46:53.200 --> 46:56.720]  And I'm not trying to sit here and gush over what you just broke down, but that's the battlefield
[46:56.720 --> 47:00.200]  and the establishment and cybersecurity admits this is a takeover.
[47:00.200 --> 47:03.880]  They're saying the Pentagon, the CIA will be involved in domestic psyops.
[47:03.880 --> 47:08.880]  They've always been, but now they're openly announcing it and that they want to use technology
[47:08.880 --> 47:14.720]  to crush the public and manipulate social networking instead of the people using it
[47:14.720 --> 47:16.280]  to restore freedom and liberty.
[47:16.280 --> 47:19.400]  So there is a battle, a war going on.
[47:19.400 --> 47:24.040]  Do you agree that we're entering the event horizon and that it will be the individual
[47:24.040 --> 47:29.840]  out there right now becoming a citizen journalist and supporting independent media who will decide
[47:29.840 --> 47:31.320]  the future of this fight?
[47:31.320 --> 47:32.640]  Yeah, it will be.
[47:32.640 --> 47:36.440]  And we have to come to the understanding that it's just, you know, if you're a reporter
[47:36.440 --> 47:41.240]  for the Washington Post, that you have certain protections that we don't have.
[47:41.240 --> 47:45.480]  Everybody has the same protection for freedom of speech and publication and everybody has
[47:45.480 --> 47:46.480]  a reporter.
[47:46.480 --> 47:51.440]  So everybody should have those same protections built in.
[47:51.440 --> 47:59.440]  But there will be a lot of contests and I'm optimistic that right now there is a lot
[47:59.440 --> 48:04.640]  of, a galvanized youth movement that's listening to our message and that's where I get some
[48:04.640 --> 48:05.640]  encouragement.
[48:05.640 --> 48:12.440]  So I'm hoping that I can get some people to dial in and look at my website, my new website
[48:12.440 --> 48:18.000]  dealing with this channel if they, you know, wanted to, I get caught up on exactly what's
[48:18.000 --> 48:22.000]  happening and seeing what's going to happen, the announcement tomorrow as well as when
[48:22.000 --> 48:23.000]  the first program.
[48:23.000 --> 48:27.920]  The first program, I think I can let that go out too today because it'll come out tomorrow
[48:27.920 --> 48:32.640]  and the first official program is going to be August 12th and for people to know and
[48:32.640 --> 48:36.920]  get more information on this, it's very easy, ronpaulchannel.com.
[48:36.920 --> 48:37.920]  Absolutely.
[48:37.920 --> 48:41.640]  And this won't be released until tomorrow, but you guys sent it to us early.
[48:41.640 --> 48:49.520]  We have your press release here, August 12th, 2013, so it will be launched and you've already
[48:49.520 --> 48:55.840]  got hundreds of thousands of people that are signing up to be part of the channel.
[48:55.840 --> 49:02.640]  And if people will support infowarsnews.com and if people will support ronpaulchannel.com
[49:02.640 --> 49:08.680]  and if people will support the true new independent media and journalism, we'll be able to hire
[49:08.680 --> 49:12.400]  the reporters, you'll be able to hire the reporters, we'll be able to hire the filmmakers,
[49:12.400 --> 49:13.400]  the researchers.
[49:13.400 --> 49:19.360]  I mean, I've spent, we did the math, Dr. Paul, in my 18 years, the amount of money I've
[49:19.360 --> 49:25.920]  made and put back in is $36 million that I've put in to infowars.com and what we do and
[49:25.920 --> 49:28.800]  it takes a lot of money to be able to do this, folks.
[49:28.800 --> 49:35.320]  You need to go be part of ronpaulchannel.com, sir, before you go, give us in the next minute
[49:35.320 --> 49:39.680]  any tidbits about the channel and what's going to be on it.
[49:39.680 --> 49:45.360]  Well, the first thing, in the early part of the show, we'll go over some very, very current
[49:45.360 --> 49:50.520]  events, sort of like what we do when I talk on your program, what's the biggest event?
[49:50.520 --> 49:54.080]  We'll quote something in the news and I'll make my commentary on it.
[49:54.080 --> 49:58.640]  The big difference is with this media, it's not like me being interviewed on the regular
[49:58.640 --> 50:03.600]  media where if I talk for a minute and a half, they cut me off or like a debate, you know
[50:03.600 --> 50:05.080]  how they do.
[50:05.080 --> 50:07.200]  There's no time limit, there's no advertising.
[50:07.200 --> 50:10.160]  It's unfiltered, we can have an online ronpaul filibuster.
[50:10.160 --> 50:18.800]  This makes me more comfortable because I'm not worried about how to pack into 32 seconds.
[50:18.800 --> 50:22.800]  Everything I want to say, you know, then you tend to want to speak quicker and this sort
[50:22.800 --> 50:23.800]  of thing.
[50:23.800 --> 50:28.800]  So it's a much more relaxed environment and we'll have guests, we're going to have guests
[50:28.800 --> 50:34.600]  on the shows and we're going to try to pick out incidents where individuals are making
[50:34.600 --> 50:37.600]  successes.
[50:37.600 --> 50:41.880]  Last weekend I was at the YAL conference, Young Americans for Liberty, something like that.
[50:41.880 --> 50:46.240]  It's a very successful group, another group that's joining us and it's only five years
[50:46.240 --> 50:47.240]  old.
[50:47.240 --> 50:48.240]  It was the outgrowth of one of our campaigns.
[50:48.240 --> 50:53.360]  So those kind of things, we want to recognize people who have achieved things and we're
[50:53.360 --> 50:54.760]  going to be taking calls.
[50:54.760 --> 51:01.280]  There's going to be, right now it's probably going to be by email, people, the listeners
[51:01.280 --> 51:06.960]  will be able to send questions in and I want to have an interactive program.
[51:06.960 --> 51:12.840]  You know, you would work so hard as a congressman, sometimes 18 hours a day on record and you've
[51:12.840 --> 51:15.920]  always been extremely articulate but I know that feeling of having a hundred things you
[51:15.920 --> 51:17.840]  want to say and then speeding up.
[51:17.840 --> 51:22.200]  Now that since you've been out of Congress just a few months, when I get a chance to
[51:22.200 --> 51:31.040]  interview you, you sound so much more relaxed, even more focused and even more clarifying.
[51:31.040 --> 51:32.880]  Are you enjoying being out of Congress?
[51:32.880 --> 51:37.440]  Yes, and there is a difference because when people ask me about that, I say at least I
[51:37.440 --> 51:41.960]  don't have to get on an airplane in the direction of Paul, of Boehner, you tell me, we'll get
[51:41.960 --> 51:43.880]  on the airplane, get up here and vote.
[51:43.880 --> 51:51.480]  And the neat thing about my channel is that we have an office here in Lake Jackson area
[51:51.480 --> 51:53.520]  where we put the studio.
[51:53.520 --> 51:58.800]  So I don't have to drive to Houston, I don't have to go anywhere and that makes a big difference
[51:58.800 --> 51:59.800]  also.
[51:59.800 --> 52:05.360]  And it is more relaxing and I have more time to read and as a matter of fact, I thought
[52:05.360 --> 52:11.360]  I'd be so busy and I'm having a little more time to write as well so I feel pretty good.
[52:11.360 --> 52:12.360]  Absolutely amazing.
[52:12.360 --> 52:17.240]  Well, I look forward to speaking to you soon once the channel launches and I look forward
[52:17.240 --> 52:19.080]  to getting you back on the economy.
[52:19.080 --> 52:24.160]  Just briefly, we see the Federal Reserve bonds in trouble, you've been warning about that
[52:24.160 --> 52:26.040]  for a long time, a brief comment on that.
[52:26.040 --> 52:30.160]  Well, yeah, there was a statement out there the other day on how much, how many billions
[52:30.160 --> 52:35.120]  of dollars they lost because interest rates have crept up a little bit against their wishes
[52:35.120 --> 52:38.600]  so that represents losses in the real value of those bonds.
[52:38.600 --> 52:41.840]  But it shouldn't, it's not going to be the feds literally that lose it to the American
[52:41.840 --> 52:47.520]  people because the taxpayer stands behind that and they can just print the money, they
[52:47.520 --> 52:51.000]  don't care about it, they're not a business, they don't have a profit loss.
[52:51.000 --> 52:56.560]  But the value of their assets did go down, it just means that they can liquidate that
[52:56.560 --> 53:00.880]  through inflation and they just print more money, but it isn't the fed that loses the
[53:00.880 --> 53:06.240]  money, it's the people, but we need, the only answer for that is get rid of central banking,
[53:06.240 --> 53:09.400]  we don't need the Federal Reserve, we need sort of sound money.
[53:09.400 --> 53:13.960]  RonPaulChannel.com, very exciting, thank you for working so hard for Human Liberty, thank
[53:13.960 --> 53:14.960]  you.
[53:14.960 --> 53:15.960]  Thank you.
[53:15.960 --> 53:20.600]  All right, there goes former Congressman Ron Paul, very exciting and he was telling
[53:20.600 --> 53:24.120]  me during the break, he goes, if I have time, he wants me to be on the show with him, so
[53:24.120 --> 53:29.800]  very exciting to be on Ron Paul's show instead of him being on my show after 18 years that
[53:29.800 --> 53:31.560]  guy's been coming on my show.
[53:31.560 --> 53:37.200]  I remember, I said I've known Ron Paul for like 14, 15 years the other day and then I
[53:37.200 --> 53:41.360]  happened to catch the rebroadcast locally at night, just that piece for about 10 minutes,
[53:41.360 --> 53:42.840]  that's not true.
[53:42.840 --> 53:45.080]  Time flies, I just keep saying 14, 15 years.
[53:45.080 --> 53:51.280]  I've known Ron Paul, now that I've thought about this, just weird how time flies, he'll
[53:51.280 --> 53:55.080]  probably end up being President if we're able to turn this country around, he's got a real
[53:55.080 --> 53:58.520]  shot at it except for the electronic voting machine fraud, I can read the tea leaves as
[53:58.520 --> 54:07.800]  anybody can, that I actually think I interviewed Ron Paul first and I was going back in memory,
[54:07.800 --> 54:13.920]  I remember listening to something called Republic Radio before I was even on it and I was on
[54:13.920 --> 54:23.240]  Republic Radio when Mark Kornke was running it with, I think it was Dan Thompson, but
[54:23.240 --> 54:32.440]  the point is I remember hearing Ron Paul on with Mark Kornke, like in 1995 when I was
[54:32.440 --> 54:39.040]  just getting on Access TV, I think it was like right out of college then, pushing his
[54:39.040 --> 54:43.640]  dad to get back into Congress because he'd been in Congress in the 80s and then as a
[54:43.640 --> 54:47.880]  libertarian, I think like the first libertarian ever elected and then run out and then he
[54:47.880 --> 54:55.560]  came back in 96, so I had just gotten on threshold radio in 96 and was able to call through Republic
[54:55.560 --> 55:02.920]  Radio and then I got Ron Paul's number and I got Ron Paul on first, then I went and met
[55:02.920 --> 55:09.240]  Ron Paul, his district used to come up to Austin, South Austin and so I met him, I think
[55:09.240 --> 55:13.840]  it was in Bastrop or something the first time, but when he was just Dr. Ron Paul, he didn't
[55:13.840 --> 55:16.960]  even really have gray hair, he had gray at the temples, that's how long I've known Ron
[55:16.960 --> 55:26.360]  Paul, 1996 in person, I'm just waxing nostalgic here, just here we are 18 years later and
[55:26.360 --> 55:30.760]  the whole New World Order is attacking Ron Paul, the whole Republican establishment,
[55:30.760 --> 55:42.400]  the Democrats, Ron Paul's retired, it's weird, it's weird how life just goes by and it's
[55:42.400 --> 55:46.520]  just interesting, it's interesting to, because it all gets foggy, you know, memory and then
[55:46.520 --> 55:50.720]  you start thinking, oh now I remember that, I remember this, I remember and now it's
[55:50.720 --> 55:54.240]  21st century, Ron Paul's going to have an internet channel that goes on TV, they've
[55:54.240 --> 56:00.200]  got TV stations lining up, I've been so busy, let me make a prisonplanet.tv important announcement
[56:00.200 --> 56:05.200]  here, I've been so busy doing the daily radio show, beta testing the nightly news for two
[56:05.200 --> 56:13.880]  years, well honestly like a month before the blaze, all that stuff that I've never, we're
[56:13.880 --> 56:17.960]  finally finishing the big studio and I'm going to give a tour of that soon, we're doing the
[56:17.960 --> 56:24.600]  satellite uplinks, the stations are pouring in in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Dallas, Chicago,
[56:24.600 --> 56:31.080]  New York, UHF, VHF cable channels, we're debating which systems to get, how much it costs to
[56:31.080 --> 56:38.240]  be on these things and I've just got to get the official TV show, not the beta testing
[56:38.240 --> 56:44.440]  you've seen launched, I've got to do it because the world is waiting before they bring in
[56:44.440 --> 56:51.040]  the censorship like Ron Paul was just saying or before they kill me and then I tell myself,
[56:51.040 --> 56:54.600]  man you shouldn't be pushing them so hard, you need to just kind of relax, get your
[56:54.600 --> 56:57.760]  show on, fight the new order that way but you know what, I just don't even have time
[56:57.760 --> 57:02.000]  to worry about it, ain't got time to bleed folks, I'm just going full on against them
[57:02.000 --> 57:06.120]  and it's up to God what happens and it's up to you as well that God moves your heart
[57:06.120 --> 57:10.400]  or if you don't believe in God, that intellectually you're moved to spend your money with us,
[57:10.400 --> 57:16.920]  because 36 million dollars sounds like a lot, I know local talk show hosts that make $500,000
[57:16.920 --> 57:22.480]  a year, just local AMFM talk show host and you know in 18 years if they put all that
[57:22.480 --> 57:30.160]  in there, you'd be talking about $9 million, in 18 years I mean if I made $40,000 in 1996
[57:30.160 --> 57:35.440]  I lived in a roach infested one bedroom apartment to put it all back into film equipment and
[57:35.440 --> 57:43.600]  if I made $200,000 I put $150 back into it and if I made $5 million in a year I would
[57:43.600 --> 57:48.840]  spend all of it expanding, I mean that's what I've done here and that's why the maximum
[57:48.840 --> 57:57.480]  effort right now is to try to really officially launch PrisonPlanet.tv and that's a good name
[57:57.480 --> 58:01.040]  for those that are awake, I need to call it something else like the Alex Jones channel,
[58:01.040 --> 58:05.280]  we've got a bunch of domain names and things and I've got to get all that done and I need
[58:05.280 --> 58:11.560]  to redesign InfoWars and PrisonPlanet, I need to, I'm not a businessman, I'm not somebody
[58:11.560 --> 58:15.520]  that knows how to manage people, I'm just trying my best, so pray for us and financially
[58:15.520 --> 58:20.440]  support us, if you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, you get 11 memberships for $5.95
[58:20.440 --> 58:24.960]  a month in operation and waking the sleeping giant to wake people up, become a PrisonPlanet.tv
[58:24.960 --> 58:28.920]  member today, see the nightly news, all the films and high def, the site's really first

[58:42.360 --> 58:50.480]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.480 --> 58:55.360]  Dozens of diseases ranging from the common cold and flu to MRSA and pneumonia are all
[58:55.360 --> 59:02.320]  caused by infectious pathogens, fortunately a simple, safe and effective alternative exists.

[59:58.320 --> 01:00:17.720]  Well, the State Department is now coming out as we speak, saying extremely, extremely
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:29.640]  super high threat level.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:35.200]  Be afraid, be very afraid, you need the NSA to plant cameras, I guess up your rear end
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.600]  to make sure Al Qaeda isn't hiding in there.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:42.000]  While they publicly run Al Qaeda, and even the New York Times, as myself and Ron Paul
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:48.400]  talked about last hour, is out today, that story is up on infowars.com, and there's multiple
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.240]  articles where they admit, yeah, it's for political gain.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:55.600]  And you know what, if they can't get their fake Al Qaeda groups to attack, bomb Yemen,
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.680]  and then get them to hopefully attack something, so you can say, isn't it scary, someone attacked
[01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:04.080]  us, now we've got to run your life and rob your bank account.
[01:01:04.080 --> 01:01:08.160]  The great danger is the military industrial complex run by foreign banks that hijack the
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:09.160]  country.
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:14.160]  Meanwhile, Texas-wide, United, we stand overpasses for Obama's impeachment.
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:18.200]  One of our reporters was out driving around and just saw people hanging on overpasses
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:23.520]  in Peach, Obama, and we went and looked it up, I'm going to get a story on infowars.com
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:29.160]  on this, statewide, United, we stand overpass for Obama's impeachment.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:33.080]  Americans and the Constitution are under attack, patriots are standing up across the country
[01:01:33.080 --> 01:01:35.800]  to say no more, we are urging demonstrations everywhere.
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:39.040]  Yeah, I think there should be spontaneous right now at the Capitol.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:42.440]  I think everybody should just go down to the front of the Capitol and they'll say you have
[01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.160]  to have a permit to be on the grounds, the great places on the, in front of 11th Street
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.280]  right in front, that's the best place anyways.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.600]  Everybody should just show up down there right now.
[01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:52.200]  If 10 people show up, it's a victory.
[01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:56.760]  It's just, we need to get the idea of spontaneously coming out against the tyrants, coming out
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:01.680]  against the NSA, they're tracking all this, they may blow something up to say, see you
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.680]  need us.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.560]  I mean, we're like, hey, that's obvious, and we'll catch them like the Boston bombing
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:08.080]  in the act.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:11.800]  They'll try to kill all the Patsies before they can speak out.
[01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:15.360]  Everywhere are encouraging to get off the couch and take a stand.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:20.080]  Right now, there will be overpass rallies against overreaching in the following locations
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.080]  in Texas.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.120]  Folks, get out there with infoawards.com.
[01:02:23.120 --> 01:02:29.800]  Get out there with whatever your maximum of liberty is and say down with the tyrants
[01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:34.320]  we know America is occupied, the July issue, I ordered 30,000 extra.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.200]  We've still got a few thousand left.
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:41.560]  One bumper stickers, four big ones, six medium size that say America has been occupied by
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:47.800]  globalist forces, infoawards.com, forbidden information, infoawards.com, you know, different
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:53.760]  variants to get people thinking, to get people reacting, to get people off their butts and
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.640]  into the mode of being aware of what's happening.
[01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.800]  We have an open tyranny coming down on us.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:06.160]  And I'll tell you again, ladies and gentlemen, this show is in the eye of the storm.
[01:03:06.160 --> 01:03:08.840]  And we're, and I've got the eye of the tiger to use that cheesy term.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.840]  I do.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:12.640]  I mean, I'm just boom, in their face, going in.
[01:03:12.640 --> 01:03:15.640]  Am I worried about how I'm going in?
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:18.800]  I'm going in.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:20.200]  Damn the maneuvers go straight at them.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:23.680]  I think that was Lord Nelson said that.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.920]  And the whole point is, is that I'm done playing games with the new world order.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:30.520]  These people are out of control themselves.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:36.080]  You study globalist and top people, they're a bunch of dysfunctional, degenerate nutballs.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:44.200]  I am not going to sit here where a bunch of Stalin, Mao, Hitler, fan club people play
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:46.000]  God over my life.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  Okay.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.240]  I've got a God and it ain't you clapper and Alexander and Obama and big sis and, and, and
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:04:02.120]  the new world order and, and David Cameron and Hollande sauce over in France.
[01:04:02.120 --> 01:04:03.120]  All of you.
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:04.680]  You people are a bunch of crazy freaks.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:09.080]  They turned out in France, all the top socialists who passed 100% taxes on middle class and
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.080]  up 100%.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:15.420]  They want all your money that they're all exempt and have giant billion euros, slush
[01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.420]  funds.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:17.420]  And it came out.
[01:04:17.420 --> 01:04:19.920]  Nobody got in trouble because they have the military with the machine guns.
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:23.880]  Well, how about the people figure out that's wrong?
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:30.200]  We are going under total collectivization, 100% taxes and Obama hires the, the French
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:34.720]  economic advisor to bring them over here to run things in this country.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:42.040]  You got a freak show of neocon scum and you got a freak show of all these fake liberals
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:49.720]  are a bunch of authoritarian trash and they say in this press release, avoid social issues.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720]  I agree with that.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.800]  Focus on the NSA violating all of our rights, absolutely nationwide.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:57.200]  Let's go to the streets.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.840]  Let's do it.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:03.680]  Are we choosing our own destiny or has it been pre selected for us?
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:07.840]  As we've moved through history, every great leader has had to understand the potential
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.240]  of information.
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:16.120]  Billions of dollars have been spent privately and publicly looking at how to tap into your
[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:22.080]  psyche from compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine.
[01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:26.320]  We are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.520]  When somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it out and
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.200]  verifying it, they can take total control of your awareness.
[01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.520]  All of this is happening so fast, you need to be ahead of the game.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:41.400]  How to engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.400]  but demand a war.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.200]  All of another one, another plane to take.
[01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.880]  State of mind because there's a war on for your mind.

[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:12.640]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:26.920]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:32.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are spontaneous demonstrations popping up all over Texas.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:38.760]  Banner hangs, one of my reporters was out and just saw it, they're all over the place.
[01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:43.480]  Some group called United We Stand, National Liberty Federation has done this and it's
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.160]  been a success.
[01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:49.960]  I guess they got 51,000 people to like them on Facebook and they're hitting the streets
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.920]  all over Austin, Dallas, Houston, we're getting the reports, we're sending reporters out right
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:54.920]  now to get photos.
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:09:01.240]  If you see these photos, take photos, if you see these banners and send them to us.
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:06.200]  There are rallies on overpasses going on all over the place and this is how we let the
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.380]  NSA and the globalists know we don't like what's happening.
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:15.600]  This is bipartisan against the tyranny of Obama and this is calling for anyone who's
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:20.040]  concerned about the violation of our rights and our liberties and the Constitution to
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.120]  stand up.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:25.280]  We're putting the press release out on infowars.com right now.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:28.880]  What about reporters was actually sick today and I said, look, you're sick, it was about
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:35.320]  11 o'clock, I said go home and he was driving, Chris Alanis, if he sees any more, tell him
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:40.720]  to take photos and send it to us, so he saw banners and rallies going on all over 35 and
[01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:42.600]  then he turned out another road and saw more.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:48.760]  So this is definitely going on all over the state and in locations in Austin, Highway
[01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:56.240]  183, Breaker Lane, I-35, it's happening in Round Rock, I mean, it's on and this certainly
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:57.240]  happened.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.240]  People are angry.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:09:59.680]  People are going to organize something like this.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:01.080]  I think this should go nationwide.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.680]  I'll talk about that.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:04.680]  It is nationwide.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.160]  Wow, this is wild.
[01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:11.720]  So just in Texas, there's 50 plus thousand, 57 thousand getting involved and it's against
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:18.000]  the NSA, the drones, the tyranny, all of it folks, it's time to let them know we're awake.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  Very exciting.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.040]  We're posting this on infowars.com right now.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:35.480]  Now shifting gears, when the writer and editor at Rolling Stones' car blew up, Michael Hastings,
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.320]  I said we should investigate it.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.360]  The eyewitnesses all said that they saw a big explosion in the street, then it flew
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:42.120]  off the road into the tree.
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:45.960]  Well, footage got released last week showing the car diving on the road and a big flash
[01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:47.480]  under it, then it goes off the road.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:49.440]  Now they've released the 911 transcripts.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:56.640]  The witnesses all saw the same thing that previous witnesses said they saw, a big explosion.
[01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:04.000]  His wife at the memorial said that she was going to quote, bring down whoever did that.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:09.240]  She told Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs that and others.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:14.240]  One of his last emails was sent to Joe Biggs and others who Joe's talked to who were afraid
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:19.280]  to speak on record, but they're the ones that talked about the feds going to his house.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:26.120]  The day before, he in an email said, get ready for raids, get lawyers, I'm going into hiding,
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:30.200]  I'm going off the radar, it's CIA, boom, his car blows up.
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.680]  I mean, that's not even two plus two equals four.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:37.200]  That's one plus one equals two, and we've got to investigate this.
[01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:46.280]  Now his wife, and I know she's under a lot of stress, went on television with Piers Morgan
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:52.040]  of all people and we're going to play a short clip of that right now and then get Staff
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.120]  Sergeant Joe Biggs take on that.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.120]  This is CNN.
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.640]  We're analyzing this piece right now.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.640]  Here it is.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:03.040]  The first time we're going to hear now from his widow, Elise Jordan, who joins me exclusively.
[01:12:03.040 --> 01:12:04.280]  Elise, good to see you.
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:05.280]  Thanks for having me.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.280]  You've been a regular on the show as well, as well as Michael.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.280]  Incredibly sad.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.280]  Incredibly tragic.
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.280]  How are you, first of all?
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:18.160]  Just taking it day by day, I was blessed to have the time with him that I had, so I feel
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:21.840]  very lucky for that and just taking it day by day.
[01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:26.440]  There have been, as there always are in these situations, wild conspiracy theories that he
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:33.480]  was chasing some hot story, maybe connected to that, his late night car crash in Los Angeles,
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.480]  other theories too.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.200]  Do you subscribe to any of this?
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.920]  Do you have any idea really what may have happened?
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:40.780]  I have no doubt that he was pursuing a hot story.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:43.200]  He always had at least five hot stories going.
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:49.360]  That was Michael, so, and he also, there will be published, his profile of John Brennan
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:55.560]  in an upcoming issue of Rolling Stone, probably in a couple of weeks, but right now the LAPD
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:57.400]  still has an active investigation.
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.920]  I don't really have anything to add.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:05.080]  My gut here is that it was just a really tragic accident and I'm very unlucky and the world
[01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:06.080]  was very unlucky.
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.080]  Okay.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:08.080]  All right, that's enough.
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:13.800]  We have interviews up on infowars.com, an article by Paul Watson, but this is a very
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:25.320]  interesting lady, Ms. Jordan, not Mrs. Hastings, married him back in May of 2011.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:30.280]  Before that, she was the Director for Communications of the National Security Council and I won't
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:31.480]  go over the rest of her pedigree.
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:35.400]  That is, it's shadow government and above CIA, above everything.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.720]  That is the top of the pyramid, folks, and very interesting.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:45.640]  So I guess she knows, I guess she's changed her mind since she told Joseph Biggs and
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:49.120]  others that she was going to bring down whoever did this.
[01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:51.400]  Joe, I know this is hard for you to talk about.
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:53.200]  You couldn't even talk on the phone last night.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:54.400]  It was so upsetting to you.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:59.120]  You, of course, were in Iraq and Afghanistan and he was embedded with you in 2008 in heavy
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:00.120]  combat.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.120]  You knew him for years.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.120]  He was one of the people.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:06.720]  He sent that last email to that he was going into hiding that they were basically after
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:07.880]  him.
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.040]  And I guess we're the bad guys.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.520]  I guess there's nothing to see here, even though the footage shows the car now blowing
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:14.640]  up before it went off the road.
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:16.000]  And I guess that's normal.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:19.120]  Mercedes just blow up in the middle of the street now.
[01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:27.160]  Yeah, I was a little unnerved by her calmness in a sense in that video.
[01:14:27.160 --> 01:14:32.200]  And I know just seeing that brought up in the news last night, gave me goosebumps and
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:33.200]  they just put me in a hole.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:38.280]  It just shook my mood from being out and happy, hanging out with my friends and just being
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:39.280]  sad.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.280]  And I couldn't even hear the interview at first.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:45.600]  I didn't get to hear it till this morning, but just to watch it, I mean, she just seemed
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.600]  happy.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:52.280]  And either she's finally getting over this or she's one hell of an actor and she's trying
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:15:00.960]  to, you know, play a facade and try to, you know, get everybody off as well.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:02.440]  Who knows?
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:08.080]  Sergeant, I know we're walking in a minefield here, you know, a lot more than you can say.
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.080]  So do I.
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:10.960]  So do his friends.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:13.480]  It's not just that she's putting a nice face on there.
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:18.960]  She has electric charm, like a beauty queen, like Miss America up there.
[01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:23.120]  And her eyes look like she's having the time of her life.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.720]  But I guess people do strange things when they're under stress.
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.400]  We can, we can make excuses for that.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.120]  What about what she said to you at the memorial service about how she was going to bring down
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.120]  who did this?
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:35.880]  I mean, this is getting like some type of who done it movie.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:39.680]  I mean, I mean, this is getting to be like an action adventure, but real life.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.680]  I don't know.
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:47.600]  I just don't want to believe that she's come to that conclusion that it's this tragic
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.600]  accident.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:53.840]  I mean, it is, it is a tragic event that happened, but accident, I still just don't see that
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.840]  as a possibility.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:01.720]  And there's too many, too many things out there, especially with that new video, just
[01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:02.720]  seeing that.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.720]  I mean, that just blows your mind.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:08.840]  I mean, there's pretty intense and then they just go on there and then say it's an accident.
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:12.040]  I just made my stomach hurt last night.
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:14.160]  You've got a distinguished military record in your own right.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.920]  A lot of tours and heavy combat.
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:18.640]  You've been blown up in an armored vehicle before.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.400]  You've seen things blow up.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.120]  When you look at that, because all the police military hot talks, they go, oh my gosh, you
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:26.400]  see the bomb go out underneath it.
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.800]  That's why the engine shot out the back.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.960]  The bomb was clearly in the front and bottom.
[01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.320]  The engine shoots out the back.
[01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.000]  The car goes off the road.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.920]  I mean, you've seen a lot of explosions and IEDs.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:38.320]  What, I mean, what does that look like to you?
[01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.960]  What does it look like to the investigators?
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:42.160]  I know you're talking to.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:44.160]  I mean, it definitely looks like some kind of explosion.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.280]  I mean, cars just don't do that.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:51.680]  The way you see that bright light and then you can just see the, well, before you even
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:56.520]  see the explosion, you see his light and it looks like if you pay attention to it, well,
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:17:01.160]  if he lost power and then you see the explosion, you see his tail lights going through down
[01:17:01.160 --> 01:17:04.520]  the road and then all of a sudden you just see nothing and then you see a flash like
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.400]  he lost control or just because the power went out or something in his car and then
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:10.360]  you see those explosions.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:12.240]  Absolutely.
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:16.320]  You see the power go out and then you see an explosion under the car and then it goes
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:20.560]  off the road into the tree, exactly what our forensic people who went out there, reporters
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:24.200]  we had go out there, said it looked like the tree was barely even damaged.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.120]  It came to rest up against the tree.
[01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:31.080]  Yeah, I've had three or four people go out there already and I just, I just talked to
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.960]  a buddy a second ago and he was out there the other day and the tree is pretty much
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:35.960]  unscathed.
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:41.440]  I mean, it definitely doesn't look like a car hit it at 130-something miles an hour.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:43.880]  The car looks like it's going 80 to me in the video.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.560]  Let me ask you this question.
[01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:48.800]  What can you say about her texting you and then the phone call and her crying in the
[01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:49.800]  background?
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:54.800]  I mean, because she goes from that to this, that was two weeks ago, she heard that from
[01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.480]  the show we were going out there.
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:00.360]  I mean, can you talk about that or should we not go there?
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:04.640]  I mean, there's nothing really to it other than, you know, she seemed like she was completely
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:10.720]  far and I told her that I was going and then, you know, just a few days prior she's, you
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:17.320]  know, her friend, she didn't even answer the phone, her friend answered the phone and said
[01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:23.160]  that Elise wouldn't be talking and she doesn't want us to go to L.A. and, you know, please
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.160]  don't go.
[01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.680]  And you could hear her crying in the background, correct?
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:31.360]  Yeah, you could hear some stuff like that was just, I was just odd and then now this,
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.080]  I just don't get it.
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:39.920]  Well, I mean, if my dad or my wife had just died a few weeks before, a month before and
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.880]  I went on television, I guarantee I'd break down crying.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:48.040]  I mean, she's just an amazing person, I guess, that she just, I guess, went through it all
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:53.440]  so we can commend her for her just radiance, like it was the Royal Wedding or something.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.440]  I don't know.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:19:00.320]  I mean, but then again, you know, she's probably, she could just be throwing people for a lukewarm
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.320]  nose.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:05.640]  I mean, she said she was working on an investigation herself, but who knows.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:10.000]  She told you that in text and in person, that she's doing an investigation.
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:14.000]  So I guess, amazing.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:19.720]  That video footage, I'm just glad that they finally released something like that, because
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:24.240]  that's something that needed to be seen by a lot of people.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:27.720]  A lot of people are trying to investigate a little bit further now and breaking down
[01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.720]  the footage.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:36.520]  One of the guys, David Wayne, he wrote for Law & Order SBU and I know he's got a lot
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:42.120]  of film analysts and stuff like that going through there and he's the one that told
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:46.960]  me, he said he could notice how the power shut down some of the cars just before that
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:48.800]  first, you know, blast you see.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:49.800]  Stay there.
[01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:53.160]  Tell us what he told you as a forensic specialist and then I want to get your take on where
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:20:00.080]  we go from here with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs, I'm Alex Jones, within FullWars.com.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:04.000]  There's a false sense of security that the greatest economic crash since the Great Depression
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000]  is over.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.880]  But unemployment is still at a 20-year high and until Americans are working again, the
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:10.640]  economy has not recovered.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.560]  What is the smartest investment you can make?
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.560]  It's food.

[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:04.440]  Ceramic body armor is rated to stop six hits.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:05.720]  But what about the seventh?
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:10.720]  Unlike ceramic or Kevlar, Infidel body armor is proven to take hit after hit and it just
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:11.720]  won't quit.
[01:21:11.720 --> 01:21:15.640]  It's reasonably priced and designed for the smart civilian treffer, Infidel stops hundreds
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:18.440]  of hits from small arms to high-powered rifles.
[01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.480]  That means safety and peace of mind.

[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:33.760]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:38.000]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:39.000]  to serve as debt.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:42.920]  Capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:45.760]  is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:49.480]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.
[01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:52.840]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.280]  It's time to understand the system.

[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:05.520]  There's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on that's about to turn your lives upside
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:07.480]  down in the coming few months.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.000]  Unbelievably, the media are keeping quiet about this.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.400]  I'm sure they know it, but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass
[01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.840]  hysteria and chaos.
[01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:22.340]  But I believe you should be informed about it, because when the sinister agenda is finally
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:27.600]  accomplished and everything unravels, only those who know this secret info will survive
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.040]  and thrive.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:33.920]  Go to 123conspiracy.com right now to see the truth.
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:41.080]  The video at 123conspiracy.com reveals the real, secret reason why Obama is after your
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.680]  guns and ammo.
[01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:47.600]  And it's not just in response to mass murders of preparing for war, it's something much
[01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:48.920]  darker.
[01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:54.520]  Go watch the video now at 123conspiracy.com before they shut it down.
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:57.520]  Again, that's 123conspiracy.com.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:02.720]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:03.720]  Box.
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.640]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:11.440]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:15.760]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:21.320]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:26.400]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:31.560]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:32.680]  normal cell.
[01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:36.360]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:40.440]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:44.800]  Call 1-866-VENUS-FLY or order from Carnivora.com.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:48.360]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A.com.
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:55.760]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUS-FLY or visit Carnivora.com.
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:56.760]  Protect your immune system.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:03.760]  It's the only one you've got.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:13.560]  All right, it's a final segment with Staff Sergeant Joe Biggs.
[01:24:13.560 --> 01:24:18.280]  I'm gonna have to get him on via Skype to really tell it all on record on the nightly
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:19.280]  news very soon.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:20.280]  I appreciate his courage.
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:25.280]  You know, he's been in a lot of combat with embedded reporters and he was telling me off-air
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:31.400]  what they do compared to Hastings and I gotta say, my gut is Hastings was more than met
[01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:35.840]  the eye and the fact that he was scared when he called people, when he wasn't scared in
[01:24:35.840 --> 01:24:36.840]  heavy combat.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:40.400]  Well, repeat what you just said, Staff Sergeant Biggs and then let's get into what that forensic
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.600]  specialist has been telling you.
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.600]  Go ahead.
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:47.920]  You know, I've, from day to day, you get reporters that come through and a lot of them don't
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:48.920]  laugh on.
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:54.120]  They get scared and, you know, it's, like I've said before, you get to learn a lot about
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:25:00.080]  somebody and just even in 30 minutes of combat, you can find out who really is somebody who's,
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:04.360]  you know, who's there to talk and who's there to do the walking and a lot of these reporters
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:08.440]  who come in here, you know, act it all hard and this and that and it turns out bullets
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:09.440]  move by their head.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:13.440]  They treat over the little ball, start crying and, you know, they'd be calling their ball
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:17.640]  space, get me out of here, I can't do this, you know, Mike would just sit there with a
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:20.160]  smile on his face and wouldn't flinch at all.
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:24.600]  I mean, I remember one day we were on this mountain top at the Pakistan border and we
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:29.920]  were getting attacked by a, you know, a huge fell of Taliban and, you know, we got Apache
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:35.120]  helicopters and little birds flying overhead, warthogs in the air, diving down, shooting.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.560]  We had hellfire missiles going off firehead and, you know, our pillar rounds, all this
[01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:43.600]  stuff going on and he's just sitting there not shaking one bit just like the rest of
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:44.600]  us who are pros at it.
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:49.680]  I mean, it was just, the CEM's so calm compared to every report I've ever seen and, you know,
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:53.320]  it was pretty intense.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:55.800]  But he was scared before his death.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.800]  Yeah.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:01.320]  And then, you know, to see this whole flip, you know, I've seen him in some of the most
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:05.160]  horrific situations any person could ever be in and he wasn't ever scared.
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:10.080]  So to be able to, you know, to hear the three, four, five days out, he was just, you know,
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:12.240]  out of his mind scared.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:18.120]  Well, you know why he wasn't scared of death from what I've seen as a reporter?
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:21.720]  He was scared by what he learned and that's what you and others were saying is that he
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:22.920]  was freaked out.
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:25.040]  He went from saying, oh, we'll work with the government too.
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:26.040]  They're the enemy.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:27.040]  They're bad.
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:30.480]  We got to stop them because of what he learned and that's what got him killed.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:37.360]  And I have to tell you, my expert opinion on this is he was probably CIA, a good guy
[01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:42.400]  thought he was trying to help America, you know, CIA army fight over turf wars.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:46.600]  That's what some of my sources have said they believe the intel is.
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.560]  He found out some really bad stuff, wasn't going to be part of it.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.320]  And he knew they were coming.
[01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:55.040]  And I think he morally knew he had to put this out and he made that decision.
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:27:00.280]  I think that's why and of course I'm speculating here, but that's what that's what I think
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.920]  is going on here.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:02.920]  Any comments on that?
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:03.920]  I mean, who knows?
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:09.920]  There's so many unanswered questions right now at this point.
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:16.920]  I mean, just like I said, I've never seen a reporter so, you know, boys and so calm
[01:27:16.920 --> 01:27:17.920]  in combat.
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:18.920]  I mean, the guy was a pro.
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.920]  I mean, he knew what he was doing.
[01:27:20.920 --> 01:27:22.920]  He was great out there at it.
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:23.920]  So just to see him that scared.
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:24.920]  Oh, I'm sure he was.
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:29.400]  And then all of his friends that I talked to, I talked to a couple on the phone earlier.
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:34.000]  And you know, it's just hard to see someone like that to be so scared.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  Yeah.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:38.720]  And then we're not supposed to investigate it.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.200]  In closing in a few minutes, we have other points you need to make.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.320]  We're going to get you back on as soon as you can to commercial free on the nightly
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.880]  news to break all this down.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:48.880]  Tell us what the forensic people you're talking to are saying.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:56.120]  They didn't notice a lot of stuff like it says power going out, the explosion, how there's
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:59.880]  you know, there's definitely no damage that could have been caused from that tree.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.560]  Everything happened prior to the tree.
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:09.080]  They said they noticed some really weird impacts around the roof area of the car.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:10.840]  So that's pretty odd.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:16.360]  Like the roof was pushed out, like up and out a little bit like a dent.
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:17.360]  You can see.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:23.120]  So I've got a group of guys that are just basically taking all that footage and going
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:28.560]  frame by frame by frame and supposed to be sending me a copy of all this breakdown.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.560]  As soon as I get that, I'll get a copy sent over there to you guys.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:33.560]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:34.560]  Yes, sir.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:36.560]  You've got all our you've got our email contacts.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.560]  Yeah, I got everything.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.560]  I got it all.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.560]  Okay, good.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:43.160]  We'll double check that because as soon as that comes out, obviously the danger is while
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:47.360]  we're getting this ready after it gets out, we're going to be protected somewhat.
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:53.280]  But this is this is definitely has this changed your views on anything on how the world works
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:55.800]  or I guess you were already awake.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:29:01.920]  What happened within six to seven months, my first time in Iraq back in 04.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:08.160]  So my it's just, you know, you go out there and you're fighting for, you know, your country
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.200]  and then all the stuff happens and at the end of the day, you know, really all you're
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:18.600]  out there fighting for is just the guy beside you and you kind of start wondering what this
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.600]  country's being all about right now.
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:21.600]  Sometimes it's just so shady.
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.680]  The things that go on, it just saddens me.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.680]  Absolutely.
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:30.760]  Well, Mr. Hastings was more than meets the eye and the establishment figured that out
[01:29:30.760 --> 01:29:31.760]  too.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:34.840]  He was going to bring them down and well, they brought him down.
[01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:39.480]  Amazing Joe, Joe Biggs, we appreciate your courage, Staff Sergeant, and I want to talk
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:43.240]  to you during the break about when we can get you on the nightly news for a full debriefing

[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:30.120]  Coming up in the third hour, I'm going to open the phones up and get into geopolitical
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:31.120]  news.
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.320]  All these hyped up terror alerts and more, even the New York Times is admitting, is being
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:39.920]  done for political purposes to sell the idea of the NSA targeting the American people.
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:46.640]  Reuters admits they're giving local police NSA data on petty crimes, and then they have
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:52.280]  to police go and create a fake investigation to then go get warrants once they've already
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.480]  spied on everybody.
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:56.080]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:59.680]  I told you this was going on because of my police sources.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:04.600]  It's only done at first, and LA, New York in the last decade is a rollout.
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:10.640]  Now they're giving even middle-sized cities access to NSA stuff, and of course 2,000 companies,
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:18.000]  it was reported, are given access to incredibly classified stuff and your private info.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.880]  And all sorts of stalkers and people are using it.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:25.200]  I mean, this is insane, so we're going to be talking about that.
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:30.880]  Coming up, we're also going to be speaking for the rest of the hour with Dan Bongino,
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.400]  the amazing Secret Service agent who's such an eloquent speaker and running for political
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:41.560]  office who stands for liberty and is the kind of person we need in office.
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:48.480]  He's like Ron Paul 2.0, so we're going to be talking to Dan Bongino who left as a senior
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:52.920]  guy going up the top of the ranks because he just couldn't sit there and hear Obama
[01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:53.920]  go.
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:54.920]  There's no tyranny around the corner.
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:57.680]  If you've got a business, you didn't build that.
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:01.360]  Who else did, telling school kids socialism's good, we're going to be talking to him though
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:07.600]  about embassy security and things because he's a real expert in that, obviously being
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:10.160]  involved in that type of stuff and the overseas trips of the president.
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.440]  So we'll talk to him in a moment.
[01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:19.600]  First off, a few of the sponsors that make this national broadcast possible only have
[01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:23.400]  sponsors I believe in, so be sure and check these sponsors out.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:28.520]  Supernatural silver pathogens are becoming increasingly dangerous, causing deadly outbreaks
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:33.400]  in hospitals, nursing homes, schools and restaurants, antibiotics and ineffective because people
[01:35:33.400 --> 01:35:34.960]  are overusing them.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:39.480]  New supernatural silver, they've got a new upgraded formula, offers a safe and effective

[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:58.960]  Now there's a lot of things I want to talk about with our next guest Dan Modgino who
[01:36:58.960 --> 01:37:03.800]  again is running for political office in his state and we should all supporting, but first
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:09.880]  off I wanted to get an update from him just overall since he resigned and discussed which
[01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:14.360]  we're seeing more and more of people in the military, people in defense contractors, people
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:19.400]  in Homeland Security, Secret Service, they just cannot be part of the shadiness that
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:24.960]  Staff Sergeant Biggs was just talking about and, and they just can't be part of it and
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:28.440]  it's kind of a catch-22 because then the good guys are out of it so that kind of leaves
[01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:33.360]  the bad guys, but overall it's the right moral decision to make but I wanted to asking what
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:39.160]  does that mean is there's an exodus of people that you would call pro-America, pro-liberty,
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:44.480]  pro-common sense and again he's running for Congress ladies and gentlemen in Maryland
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:48.320]  and he joins us and we're going to give you his website as well.
[01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:54.880]  He's running for Maryland's six district and I want to call him Congressman right now
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:00.360]  and I'm told they know you're a threat, I'm told you got your house burglarized so that
[01:38:00.360 --> 01:38:02.360]  shows that somebody's certainly concerned.
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:07.640]  Yeah, it's not the first time Alex and thanks for having me by the way, they've targeted
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:13.360]  my, my cars and my wife was eight months pregnant and they had put, someone put nails in two
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:18.960]  of her tires and four of my campaign staff, same thing and campaign headquarters broken
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:23.960]  into but you know that's kind of what they do and I just roll with it you know I'm six
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:29.400]  one doing a 15 pound so I'm more worried about my family than I am myself but you know that's
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.760]  that's what they do it's, it's thuggery at its finest and unfortunately when you speak
[01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:38.600]  out and you stand for, for liberty and you stand against it and you know I just want
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:42.520]  to make this one point it's not just against the Obama administration I think you know
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:47.200]  that there are Republicans out there too, absolutely, that's about liberty there's some
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:51.200]  out there who care more about their own power than liberty too so it's a bipartisan indictment
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:55.240]  of the system but you definitely put a target on your back when you do that.
[01:38:55.240 --> 01:39:00.040]  Absolutely and Scripps Howard News Service AP you name it have picked up all the burglaries
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:05.400]  and harassment that you're going through right now I mean that right there's the certification
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:08.760]  that you're the man right there and the campaign's going well isn't it?
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:12.240]  Yeah I mean you know when you listen when you're shaking people up we've got a, we've
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:18.400]  got a few left wing outlets come after us for everything from shocker meeting with conservatives
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.160]  in DC, left wing media alumina after us and said yeah he meets with conservatives in DC
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:28.840]  to advance conservative causes to handle you know that we had some meetings with another
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:34.200]  journalism outfit too I mean they make up stuff it's really terrible and if you only
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:39.520]  knew folks what went on behind closed doors I mean you would be disgusted if you think
[01:39:39.520 --> 01:39:46.080]  this government revolves around a citizen-centric model and that public service is a priority
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:49.040]  and I've got bad news where you're living in a fantasy land and there are some good
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:53.840]  people out there don't get me wrong but they're very few and you mentioned it in the opening
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:59.120]  of the show more and more people are just turning up there you know they're turning
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:02.960]  their head and discussing walking away and finding out not walking away from making
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:07.080]  a difference but walking away and finding out a different way to shake up the system
[01:40:07.080 --> 01:40:09.680]  because it is unquestionably broken.
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:12.800]  You know I know you saw a lot of things and you saw national security agreements so you
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:17.440]  can't talk about it or you'll go to jail like a whistleblower but I mean when you talk
[01:40:17.440 --> 01:40:21.920]  about the dirty deals behind the scenes we've got a good idea it seems like the corruption
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:27.040]  is so rampant now they don't even get in trouble I mean you said it was the speeches and things
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:33.200]  was one reason you left hearing Obama's basically push stuff that Mao would push but I think
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.240]  that's obviously the main suspects it would be other you know feds coming in because of
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:43.120]  what you do know aren't you in probably danger because of some of the things you saw you
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:47.000]  may not even know what they were that's got them concerned why they're breaking into
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:52.440]  your house and your car and places like that I mean my question is if I knew all the stuff
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:56.000]  you knew I'd probably go ahead and just say it because then I think that makes you safer
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  is what I'm saying.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:03.320]  Yeah you know it's not a not a bad point but you know I did swear an allegiance in and
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:08.240]  my you know was Mao's mean something to me and outside of the things I saw which were
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:13.240]  blatantly unconstitutional which I have no obligation under Mao to the Constitution to
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:17.040]  keep quiet outside of those things you know obviously they're personal things that keep
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:22.040]  quiet but you know I'm just in full bravery on my part you know I mean it Alex I'm not
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:27.160]  sitting here trying to you know to sit there and pound my chest but I just don't worry
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:32.120]  about it that much I mean my family and I took an enormous financial hit to do what we did
[01:41:32.120 --> 01:41:37.320]  to walk away you know my FBC records of public you can look yourself you know we certainly
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:41.800]  didn't get rich off any of this but the country is at a turning point I mean I mentioned this
[01:41:41.800 --> 01:41:45.720]  last time I was on your show this is a real turning point I want to those fictional turning
[01:41:45.720 --> 01:41:50.040]  points people just like to row you up over at the turning point this is it I mean we
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:54.440]  are moving down one of these past where your liberty is being treated like a commodity
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:59.960]  you can't exchange it's traded amongst people and full party officials and insiders and
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:05.040]  cronies your liberty and yet oddly enough the one person out of the table is you so
[01:42:05.040 --> 01:42:09.680]  you have to say to yourself when you're someone like me on the inside you know and I honor
[01:42:09.680 --> 01:42:13.600]  and I respect the Secret Service agent who you know these guys and men and women are fantastic
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:18.520]  to put their lives on the line but you know for in a heartbeat for the president and everyone
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:23.600]  else they protect but I just didn't I felt kind of like a parasite like I was you know
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:28.920]  just sucking off the system and then I wasn't doing everything I could do and I I kept imagining
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:34.040]  a eulogy in a world that was different than the world we know today for the worst and
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:38.080]  someone saying well what did he do to change it and then my kids looking up and going well
[01:42:38.080 --> 01:42:41.680]  I don't know Dan right now they're not going to have any problem answering that question
[01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:45.960]  now Dan I admire you so much I don't say that to be sappy because I've gone through some
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:50.120]  of the same things you've gone through the break ins the physical attacks the death threats
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:54.720]  where they're listening to your phone and and tell you what you were talking about so you
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:58.760]  know it's the government or contractors and for people that have an experience is they
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:03.280]  don't know and people say aren't you scared you know why do you go you know out in public
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:07.640]  why do you go do the things you do with no bodyguards and you know what I I it's not
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:12.760]  even about being afraid I've chosen a side but it's not even choosing I'm not a thug
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:17.720]  and a criminal I'm not a scumbag I'm not part of their gang I don't even have free will
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:24.600]  really I have to confront and oppose these people and I think that's what you just crystallize
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:28.600]  there is that you know you're not beating your chest saying I don't care I'm not scared
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:34.840]  it's beyond courage it's you know you cannot commit the world to evil and standing down
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:41.560]  is joining it silence is consent and you will not be part of the dark side yeah I mean we're
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:47.480]  not we're being ruled we're not being governed anymore you know what made this country great
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:51.800]  exceptional different than every other place in the world is the respect and the dignity
[01:43:51.800 --> 01:43:57.800]  of individual liberty a constitution that limited them the government not you but I think what
[01:43:57.800 --> 01:44:03.040]  unfortunately a lot of the soccer mom crowd is ignoring is the fact that your liberty
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:08.120]  is really disappearing in real time and it has a real consequence out I mean look at your
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:13.120]  economic liberty do what do you think taxation is do you work for a hundred dollars a year
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:17.800]  using round numbers and now upwards to forty seven to fifty percent of it is taken by the
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:22.520]  government who sales income capital gains corporate all these other taxes and forty
[01:44:22.520 --> 01:44:28.000]  percent of the time you work for someone else I mean that's not liberty or freedom you know
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:32.640]  when you look at Obamacare you folks you really think that was about health care seriously
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:36.800]  but you really believe that that was about how I assure you having lived in this bubble
[01:44:36.800 --> 01:44:40.600]  it had nothing to do with health care it has everything to do with taking away decision
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:44.960]  life or death decision making away from you and putting it in their pockets I mean we've
[01:44:44.960 --> 01:44:49.840]  never had any kind of education liberty public school systems and it's death panels it's
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:55.720]  socialist eugenics absolutely and it's buying and selling our liberties trading them away
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:45:00.360]  I want to get into the Benghazi situation because you're somebody that was the head guy when
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:05.600]  Obama went overseas so you you know exactly what went on there and it's coming out missiles
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:10.520]  to Al Qaeda and the stand down but before we go there let's right now make this important
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:14.400]  you put it on the line you didn't talk to me before you came on the air you were coming
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:18.960]  on about the embassy stuff I'm saying this now everybody in Maryland needs to stand
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:24.680]  with Dan Bongino and his family and get him into office this is a real guy folks you can
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:29.360]  feel it you can see it your gut tells you we've got to put this guy in Congress with
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:34.640]  an overwhelming vote to overpower their electronic voting machines these are the type of people
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:40.080]  we need there who have a conscience that that's their most valued possession is being honorable
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:46.240]  and how do people donate what's the best site to go to Bongino dot com yeah thank you B-O-N-G-I-N-O
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:50.440]  dot com I appreciate now thank you no people but they did not just donate they need to
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:54.520]  come out and support you in Maryland I mean I'm reading the campaigns going well you're
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:59.080]  getting support yeah we've we've been very lucky but you know last time we ran we started
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:04.760]  with nothing I had two donors being my father and we built the largest donor list in Maryland
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:09.640]  the one of the largest donor list in the northeast quarter we really fired up a grassroots base
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:13.120]  of you know it's funny how people would say to me when I would get speeches because you
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:16.720]  know I never I never wrote them I would just go out speak from the heart and people would
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.280]  say wow I've never heard anything like that before and I you know that's the sad part
[01:46:20.280 --> 01:46:24.720]  you know that all I did was just tell you the truth and you thought it was good it wasn't
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:29.440]  good it was just unusual because you're so not used to hearing the truth from people
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:33.320]  that when a guy gets up there speaks with some passion about what's really happening
[01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:37.880]  you think it's quote good there's nothing good about it it's just the truth the truth
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:43.880]  has no agenda and we just built a massive army of people so starting this time was obviously
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:48.320]  a lot easier than last time where we had to build it from scratch now we have a solid
[01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:53.000]  basis point we have a huge social media following on Facebook and Twitter and it really helps
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:58.040]  me get the Liberty message out I try to tweet and Facebook about Liberty at least two or
[01:46:58.040 --> 01:47:03.280]  three times a week and it's never scripted I come home I'll usually put on some music
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:08.120]  and I will just go and tell people how I really feel and what I saw and what I think is really
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:15.400]  wrong and importantly how we can fix this disaster we're at now absolutely and folks
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:18.840]  who go to bonjino.com and find your Twitter find your Facebook everybody should follow
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:23.040]  you there I'm going to tweet out during the next break from real Alex Jones at Twitter
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:28.600]  for folks to follow you and I hope listeners libertarians and constitutionals don't tend
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:32.400]  to be big Twitter people but we all need to become big Twitter folks because sometimes
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:35.920]  I'm out there in the field that's all I've got to get a message out and the same thing
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:39.440]  for Mr. Bonjino and the fact that they're coming after him breaking in his house his
[01:47:39.440 --> 01:47:46.320]  car harassing his family right there folks we've I mean we just had on Staff Sergeant
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:52.000]  Biggs with all the other special forces guys that were friends with Michael Hastings who
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:57.200]  know they killed him and they're all scared folks and it just shows how dangerous this
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:01.880]  is but if they put a bullet in me I want ten more to stand up my place if they put a bullet
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:06.680]  in Bonjino you've got to do the same thing I'm enough is enough folks the war for this
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:12.440]  Republic is now now shifting gears speaking of bullets they put bullets in Ambassador
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:16.880]  Stevens knowing what you know about embassy security a lot of it classified running off
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:21.400]  foreign operations when the president would go overseas and visit embassies what is going
[01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:26.040]  on from a train die when you see that well what I found out about this is there's been
[01:48:26.040 --> 01:48:31.920]  communications between Al's hour here in Pakistan and in Yemen you know one of our one of the
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:37.400]  main aqap operators in Yemen but the breeze in this other communication strikes me here's
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:41.840]  what I mean these guys are very and I don't mean this qualitatively please but they're
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:47.640]  very savvy in a devious way with their communication they've learned everything from using drop
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:52.200]  boxes in emails that don't formally send it that all kinds of shot I don't want to give
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:56.760]  anybody else any ideas but ways to manipulate cell phones so they can't be traced they are
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:49:01.440]  very savvy in that respect the fact that they likely knew they were being monitored which
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:05.360]  of course they know and brazenly made these kind of communication knowing it was going
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:10.160]  to get out there says to me from having gone through this over and over and having read
[01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:15.560]  volumes of intel reports and overseas op was that this was really in the end operational
[01:49:15.560 --> 01:49:22.840]  page and any fear of having the operation broken up was was probably not really didn't
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:27.280]  frighten them enough to you know to communicate this thing was ready ready to go but the problem
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:31.760]  Alex is I don't really trust this administration anymore with their information and they've
[01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:36.480]  lost all credibility between Benghazi and we don't even know what was going on there
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:40.600]  with potential gun running we really don't have any credibility the only thing that makes
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:45.520]  me believe this is this could be really credible and I hope it's not is that a lot of the foreign
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:51.600]  embassies have shut down to and we're usually pretty reluctant especially after Iraq to
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:55.400]  be sharing information and intel with foreign embassies foreign government sure well I mean
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:50:00.680]  Obama is bad enough and I know they'll crucify if you agree with me he's bad enough and even
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:04.200]  the New York Times says these terror alerts are being used for political purposes to
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:09.760]  distract from NSA to turn to blind eye and let some jihadi group funded up the chain
[01:50:09.760 --> 01:50:14.520]  they're funding them in Syria and Libya to attack a few embassies as a political distraction
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:20.120]  this could also be a false flag Obama's about to pull well this NSA thing you know yes they
[01:50:20.120 --> 01:50:26.080]  need to get the attention of this thing so badly and I I really I cannot believe I mean
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:30.400]  really there's a part of me that is having a hard time digesting the fact that there
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:34.680]  are people who call themselves republicans out there actually support this program you
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:40.160]  know folks it information in the hands of a government without an independent arbiter

[01:54:13.200 --> 01:54:19.040]  secret service agent until he resigned he ran the overseas operations that's the most
[01:54:19.040 --> 01:54:24.280]  important thing the secret service does when the president goes anywhere is the overseas
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:28.640]  business they see that as the most dangerous at least when I've read the newspapers and
[01:54:28.640 --> 01:54:32.760]  you were telling me some stuff off air about your sources in the secret service currently
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:37.120]  I don't know how much you can say on air but just just say what you can about about
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:42.160]  Benghazi where it's going about the current threat and the points you were making about
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:49.160]  Obama's credibility well first off you have an extremely loyal audience thanks to those
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:51.600]  who just followed me on Facebook that's a record consider I've been on a number of radio stations
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:56.320]  that's a record amount of Facebook likes in the last couple of minutes but thank you folks
[01:54:56.320 --> 01:55:00.680]  it's very nice yeah my a lot of my intel and military stories have been talking to me over
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:05.480]  and over I have a book coming out November on this topic and folks if you don't believe
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:10.400]  there was a standout order here really you're you're you're you're living in a fantasy land
[01:55:10.400 --> 01:55:14.280]  I just hate to tell you this but there's a team out there Alex fast foreign emergency
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:19.120]  support team it can be here's an analogy imagine with the secret service God forbid
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:22.960]  something would happen to the president right no one has to be told in the secret service
[01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:28.280]  to respond you just go that's what you do well that's what the best team does the foreign
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:33.320]  emergency support team they responded to these types of incidents before why they didn't
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:37.880]  respond to this should have set up red flags everywhere it was brought up in the Capitol
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:42.080]  testimony and the media is largely ignored it I wrote an op-ed piece in the Washington
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:46.200]  Times about this because I've got friends who have been talking to me about these guys
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:51.880]  were told not to go there is no question in my mind this was politically motivated I
[01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:55.960]  hate to tell you that folks but if you're ignoring this you're ignoring it it's your
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:00.800]  own peril because that's fabric of security that those guys secret service and BSS provides
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:06.080]  has been absolutely shredded the cavalry always showed up in the past and that promise has
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:11.040]  been broken at very good why would they do something like this to show their hind end
[01:56:11.040 --> 01:56:14.560]  everybody in the government because the whole Pentagon knows it was a stand down they watched
[01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:19.400]  it from the predator drones the ships all know I've talked a lot of people off record
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:24.920]  who were able to even see it some major fits were thrown people resigned major generals
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:31.840]  you name it why would the Obama administration do something like this protecting the jihadis
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:37.040]  uh... there in Benghazi but there's only two explanation here folks one they are the most
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:42.280]  incompetent administration in presidential history and literally didn't know what to
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:46.560]  do so he just we i mean we already know we want upstairs to the living quarters without
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:50.960]  any resolution to the incident whatsoever so that's explanation possibility number one
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:55.200]  which i don't believe the second explanation is they knew exactly what they were doing
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:59.120]  and given the proximity of the presidential election they could not have out in public
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:04.000]  that one that was a terrorist attack and to their foreign policy in libya collapsed three
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:06.520]  at the i a operation was going to be uncovered
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:10.520]  so the second tough fork in that road is that they knew exactly what they were doing and
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:12.120]  for political reason
[01:57:12.120 --> 01:57:14.080]  they let these four guys die
[01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.480]  post-pandemic either either one of those answers
[01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:23.880]  it is is horrific for any leader one is treason and uh... either one is completely uh...
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:28.840]  criminal and now cnl and telegraph they're all reporting cia people have told them
[01:57:28.840 --> 01:57:30.280]  that now we were giving
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:34.240]  uh... service to air anti-aircraft missiles to al-qaeda
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:37.680]  and al-qaeda it doesn't a lot of it doesn't make sense when you think about it
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:38.120]  and
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:40.440]  there's been some people have been around this now that
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:44.000]  why if we were running these guns in the surface air missiles and he's he's a
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.280]  advanced weapon
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:49.400]  to syrian rebels who were uh... embedded with al-qaeda i think anybody dispute
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:51.120]  that it was a talk about the
[01:57:51.120 --> 01:57:52.640]  why would al-qaeda
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:54.880]  to enter al-sharia attack the complex
[01:57:54.880 --> 01:57:59.280]  there may be an iranian hispala access here
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:03.080]  a couple of people are starting to hit around to which would open up a whole
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:03.840]  different
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:06.800]  can't work but again you can't trust anything
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:09.880]  that comes from this administration they've blown all their credibility
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:12.800]  they put jay cardy up there you know that's an interesting point stay there
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:15.400]  we got to come back to five more minutes with you and appreciate your time
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:18.560]  iran does not want those missiles getting
[01:58:18.560 --> 01:58:22.720]  uh... into syria because what syria falls iran's next that's actually an
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:25.280]  interesting point that's what your sources are saying that could be what's
[01:58:25.280 --> 01:58:25.920]  going on
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:29.720]  yes but it doesn't make sense how is why would al-qaeda attack an operation
[01:58:29.720 --> 01:58:30.920]  funding al-qaeda
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:32.600]  in syria doesn't make any sense
[01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:36.400]  best interest is with you unless you want to get rid of the ambassador and

[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:14.320]  uh... is that in an investigation there's no doubt there's a standout there's no
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:15.520]  doubt they're lying
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:18.920]  there and then you just have to look at the facts it goes from bad to worse

[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:32.120]  you know in the upper ranks of the military who said
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:35.480]  well we don't send people into and these are not the rancid bottom of their
[02:01:35.480 --> 02:01:38.080]  guys you guys are really upset they're the ones you're probably talking i don't
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:39.400]  want to call me
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:41.240]  he's a guy who wanted to respond
[02:01:41.240 --> 02:01:43.640]  that we don't send troops into
[02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:48.760]  you know the unknown really not that you already sent the ambassador in these
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:52.520]  these three others that that died these these patriots that died over there
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:53.720]  into the unknown
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:57.080]  so you don't send our military and i don't want to go in
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:01:59.800]  to save them and protect them when their mission is that
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:03.960]  is that you know wrapped themselves in the flag that's a little bold as you
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:05.680]  said the default
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:09.880]  if a submarine sinks they launched the submarine rescue crew that it's default
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:12.760]  or of the president's attack the secret service goes in action
[02:02:12.760 --> 02:02:16.040]  or the state department has their units it's just a total lie
[02:02:16.040 --> 02:02:19.880]  folks you know you're being manipulated i i i i don't want to tell me
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:22.400]  conspiratorily or scary of it
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:25.360]  there is a crop of people that this
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:30.120]  it is it is a tyrannical group of insiders crony capitalist
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:34.640]  politicians who only care about the next election consultant class folks and
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:37.520]  elected officials some from both sides
[02:02:37.520 --> 02:02:41.120]  that there are only interested in preserving the system
[02:02:41.120 --> 02:02:44.800]  they're only interested in why we think about it frank wilson initiative to move
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:47.120]  this select special select committee forward
[02:02:47.120 --> 02:02:49.120]  to get subpoena power up a guy
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:51.280]  why haven't everyone in congress
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:55.040]  signed onto that what you don't want that because you don't want the answers
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:58.040]  they don't want to tell you the truth you're being manipulated with just like
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:02.480]  on nsa it turned out congress knew about it all went along with it they wanted
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:05.600]  to act like they didn't know you know they have a name for this
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:08.960]  uh... it's organized crime it's it's a gang
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:12.320]  uh... but but although that came you know there can't be gangs in our
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:13.760]  government the other can
[02:03:13.760 --> 02:03:15.680]  historically it's called tyranny
[02:03:15.680 --> 02:03:19.600]  right and alex if it's an essay program was so fantastic right
[02:03:19.600 --> 02:03:23.240]  and it was worth collecting data on every single america by the way which is
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:25.680]  an absolute travesty
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:30.920]  don't tell me it's constitutional okay that is absolute hogwash nonsense

[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:22.440]  our military
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:25.600]  sources he said he was totally scared
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:30.280]  this is a guy who'd been in heavy combat in huge battles they said they'd never
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:32.120]  seen a member of the press without much courage
[02:09:32.120 --> 02:09:36.000]  yeah cuz our evidence is Hastings wasn't who he appeared to be he was
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:41.280]  probably CIA but continuing we're gonna be looking at all of that and looking
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:43.280]  at the shame of foster care and
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:46.400]  some big developments on that front but finishing up with

[02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:59.080]  bonjino.com Dan Bonjino is here with us a popular guest
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:03.160]  and he was saying during the break you know since when did freedom get so hard
[02:10:03.160 --> 02:10:03.880]  to sell
[02:10:03.880 --> 02:10:07.200]  well since the media and the establishment sold out but I think the
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:08.400]  awakening has started again
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:12.600]  you were getting into the whole NSA situation and
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:16.480]  who they're targeting and what they're doing it came out in Reuters yesterday
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:20.120]  that they're giving it even to local police but you were telling me off air
[02:10:20.120 --> 02:10:23.280]  police you know around America are really starting to wake up so
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:27.600]  putting bookends on this interview getting into NSA spying what does that
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:30.640]  really mean from somebody that's been on the inside of this
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:34.360]  yeah you know I like telling stories but in allergies because they make it real
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:37.520]  they make it bleed for people you know you have to make it real and material
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:38.800]  they don't feel like you're losing anything
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:42.840]  what's gonna happen is one of these days is here's a scenario paint for you
[02:10:42.840 --> 02:10:46.240]  you're gonna be needed an investigation against your neighbor now you've done
[02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:48.720]  nothing wrong okay but your neighbor's say is involved in
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:52.160]  what they do get some terrorist act or whatever it may be or something maybe
[02:10:52.160 --> 02:10:55.520]  national security they're gonna come to you they're gonna knock on your door and
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:11:00.560]  they're gonna say hey here's a email you sent to your buddy Tony whatever 15 years
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:04.760]  ago saying that you were gonna you know punch some guy in the face because he
[02:11:04.760 --> 02:11:07.440]  wouldn't move his car out from your house did you know that's aggravated
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:11.480]  harassment and by the way if you don't tell us what we need against your
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:15.400]  neighbor the information then you're going down for aggravated harassment
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:19.120]  then you may say oh that sounds crazy really it sounded crazy that they would
[02:11:19.120 --> 02:11:23.440]  target conservative groups for their IRS with their IRS history as well
[02:11:23.440 --> 02:11:28.360]  folks you give the government information it will be abused I am telling you it
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:32.040]  is just a matter of time it is not a matter of it and one more point of this
[02:11:32.040 --> 02:11:36.760]  Alex what makes America great is you decide when that the private self and
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:40.360]  the public self to where that line is okay you know this liberty versus
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:45.000]  security canard is a complete red herring nonsense okay you decide that
[02:11:45.000 --> 02:11:49.720]  in totalitarian regime that's decided for you everything's public they
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:52.280]  encourage parents to rat on their kids
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:56.080]  uncles to rat out on ants every there's nothing private that's already
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:12:00.360]  starting here yeah well then that's that's what I'm saying when they have
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:03.760]  access to your information when when you open your garage door in the morning
[02:12:03.760 --> 02:12:07.280]  when I do I know the public self begin okay you know well if you're doing
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:09.680]  nothing wrong you have nothing to worry about nonsense we're all doing
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:13.240]  something wrong we're human beings we're all fallible okay we decide as long as
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:16.520]  you're wrong don't infringe on the civil liberties of others you're left alone
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:19.840]  that's the deal we have here right when I open my garage door in the morning I
[02:12:19.840 --> 02:12:23.600]  know the public self begin if you keep going down this road you're going down
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:29.240]  now that garage door is open all the time there is no private you and we are
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:34.160]  just like every other totality sure sure exactly we don't live in glass houses
[02:12:34.160 --> 02:12:40.840]  because to be free you've got to have privacy plus this NSA grid and all these
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:45.440]  hackers they've hired they're on records they can plant fake stuff in your
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:50.640]  digital file or if you're running for office use a medical issue you've got
[02:12:50.640 --> 02:12:55.840]  against you they're on record already doing this I mean take all the governors
[02:12:55.840 --> 02:12:59.320]  and people they found with hookers and I'm not saying that's a good thing but
[02:12:59.320 --> 02:13:03.760]  they were sitting on all that until they wanted to burn somebody when they were
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:10.640]  exposing banking corruption and so again it's going to be used selectively and
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:14.000]  that's the word I've gotten from Congress and it's come out the cloak room
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:18.280]  has been bugged is that the Justice Department is using people cheating on
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:22.080]  their wife 10 years ago people joking around on the email saying I want to
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:26.640]  kill my neighbor or whatever they all are using that for blackmail right now
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:32.200]  right the greatest commodity in Washington DC is not the bankrupt fed
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:37.440]  it's not gold it's information folks information is the greatest most
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:41.760]  valuable commodity you can have in the bubble of Washington DC I promise you
[02:13:41.760 --> 02:13:45.880]  you forfeit it and you give it up without a fight I'm telling you you're
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:50.560]  gonna ruin the day you failed to do something a fight back organized sure
[02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:53.960]  what you need to do but you better get involved or you will regret the day I
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:14:00.640]  promise you well here's another analogy we hear about these fools these who would
[02:14:00.640 --> 02:14:04.720]  go on Facebook and say I'm going to Cancun for Christmas I'll be gone six
[02:14:04.720 --> 02:14:09.160]  days here's where we're staying and the woman you know was look my husband just
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:12.480]  bought me a 10 carat diamond ring the thieves are waiting they know what
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:15.960]  hotel you're at they've already case you they break in your room and steal the
[02:14:15.960 --> 02:14:19.880]  ring that's a real case let's expand you go I'm going to see my grandma for two
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:24.600]  days look what I got for Christmas again where you live the thieves come and
[02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:29.560]  break in your house it's not that you've done something wrong bad people will use
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:34.560]  your lack of privacy to abuse you there's a reason we lock our doors there's a
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:38.680]  reason we pull our shades there's a reason we have fences and walls it's so
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:42.720]  that bad people have to go through something before they get to us and
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:48.280]  they don't have intel on us rendering us defenseless right and they come at you
[02:14:48.280 --> 02:14:51.840]  from two different argument a lot of these so-called you know Republicans who
[02:14:51.840 --> 02:14:55.360]  support this they come at you from the well it's gonna make a safer argument
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:58.880]  which is it's not that it's garbage again it's investigative lazy and then the
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:02.280]  liberal side comes at you from it doesn't matter the end result the same but
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:06.080]  they come at you with the argument that the anointed ones as Thomas Sowell used
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:09.240]  to call you know the in his book visually anointed the anointed one should
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:12.240]  run your life should have access to all your information because they're just so
[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:16.200]  much smarter than the stupid people like us out either way it doesn't matter the
[02:15:16.200 --> 02:15:21.080]  end result is the same the personal you is never personal it's all public and
[02:15:21.080 --> 02:15:25.040]  again that you might as well that whatever that flag doesn't mean to you
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:28.400]  what it means to me if you believe my information is your information just
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:32.840]  because you say it so and you've declared a constitutional it's not read the
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:37.240]  document I show you it's pretty clear on those on those on those portions your
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:40.600]  personal effect should be secure and right now they're not I'm not giving the
[02:15:40.600 --> 02:15:43.920]  key to my house any government official for any reason whatsoever well that's
[02:15:43.920 --> 02:15:47.600]  the other side look how secretive government's getting while telling us
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:53.040]  that we shouldn't have any secrets it is incredibly transparent final question
[02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:57.240]  folks can go to your campaign and learn more foot soldiers they're on the ground
[02:15:57.240 --> 02:16:01.040]  in Maryland absolutely got to get behind this guy and the and and the
[02:16:01.040 --> 02:16:04.680]  person he's running against just absolutely needs to be defeated bonjino
[02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:11.320]  dot-com another Ron Paul in the in the in the in the Congress folks in your gut
[02:16:11.320 --> 02:16:15.800]  do you think we're going to turn the tide because I know historically it's only
[02:16:15.800 --> 02:16:20.240]  when things get really bad that people finally get out of denial or is the
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:24.520]  tyranny so sophisticated and it's known the awakening was coming that they've
[02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:28.080]  already organized themselves to be able to stop us I mean what does your gut
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:32.680]  tell you about this fight you know Alex I'm always an optimist and I've seen it
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:36.560]  it's bad it's ugly it's ugly on both sides but you know we've been through a
[02:16:36.560 --> 02:16:40.600]  lot and I do believe that some divine providence has led this country to be so
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:44.680]  different there's no reason we should be as exceptional as we are other than the
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:48.560]  fact that there's there's got to be some heavenly intervention here I think we're
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:51.920]  going to fix this it's going to take some time but folks members only power in
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:56.720]  now you have to do something not talk you have to get involved if we're just
[02:16:56.720 --> 02:17:01.280]  talking that's called whining we have to get involved I took a huge hit to my
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:05.240]  life to do this I'm not asking for your sympathy or your sorrow but I'm saying
[02:17:05.240 --> 02:17:10.960]  do something talk is not enough so please get involved in yes I think we are
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:14.080]  going to change it because what liberty should not be such a tough sell
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:17.600]  certainly hasn't been for me out there on the top we've really changed a lot of
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:22.160]  mine that's right people tend to over plan things and then rationalize if you
[02:17:22.160 --> 02:17:25.840]  know it's right to stand against something whatever it is gut up do it
[02:17:25.840 --> 02:17:29.640]  whether it's small medium or large little things you know grow into big
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:35.720]  things commit to freedom commit to American liberty that made us so great
[02:17:35.720 --> 02:17:41.160]  and and we can go back to being a prosperous good nation it's time for the
[02:17:41.160 --> 02:17:44.240]  good men and women who've been doing nothing to stand up and it's time people
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:47.720]  that have been doing something to redouble their efforts because we can
[02:17:47.720 --> 02:17:52.040]  clearly see where this road is going is not a good place when you turn this
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:55.480]  around Dan thank you so much for the time and I can't wait for you to get
[02:17:55.480 --> 02:17:58.520]  into Congress thanks Alex it was an honor I appreciate it thank you sir
[02:17:58.520 --> 02:18:01.640]  goodbye all right folks there he goes that was a good interview was only be
[02:18:01.640 --> 02:18:05.000]  like 20 minutes long but I held him at this hour because it's just a great guy
[02:18:05.000 --> 02:18:08.760]  you can tell he's a great guy and you can tell that he's got a lot of courage
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:11.320]  and they're breaking in his house they're breaking in his business they're
[02:18:11.320 --> 02:18:17.360]  breaking in his car they're messing with his wife and and all I can tell you is
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:21.080]  is that I really worry about that because if I ever catch somebody
[02:18:21.080 --> 02:18:25.760]  physically threatening my family I'm gonna I mean it just it's over and I
[02:18:25.760 --> 02:18:28.600]  think they know that that's that's that's the one thing I've got to control
[02:18:28.600 --> 02:18:33.520]  myself with with these people I am so sick of the scum that have overrun this
[02:18:33.520 --> 02:18:37.720]  country and you heard him he said they're clicks bipartisan of technocrats and
[02:18:37.720 --> 02:18:42.720]  insiders and lobbyists and and special interests that literally know what
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:47.560]  they're doing and they want to block us from having them bankrupt the country so
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:53.280]  they can get even richer at our expense they're putting a police state in so we
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:18:59.680]  can never get the country back it is a conscious move a conspiracy there's
[02:18:59.680 --> 02:19:04.320]  thousands of charges per city a year of conspiracy this conspiracy to do that
[02:19:04.320 --> 02:19:08.160]  but oh when government does it it doesn't exist no there is a globalist
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:13.880]  corporate conspiracy against common sense and against individualism and
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:17.160]  against the family I mean turn on television and the dramas and movies
[02:19:17.160 --> 02:19:23.160]  it's all about your anti-family anti-male anti-liberty bull because the only
[02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:26.160]  people that are allowed to be male are the people that work for the system and
[02:19:26.160 --> 02:19:29.920]  they're all super male trying to dominate us but then we're all supposed to
[02:19:29.920 --> 02:19:34.300]  just cower down here and run around and fear well I'm not doing it okay you get
[02:19:34.300 --> 02:19:37.600]  a double middle finger for me to the new world order and I'm sorry to talk like
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:41.280]  that but that's what it comes down to I am going down with the ship I am not
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:45.400]  bowing to you murderers because let me tell you something bowing to them is
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:49.760]  giving consent to all their crimes and that's why I have no fear folks these
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:53.920]  people are hurting innocents all over the world and I'm sick of it being done in
[02:19:53.920 --> 02:19:58.960]  my name and I am not gonna be part of it I do not need those spiritual bowling

[02:25:09.520 --> 02:25:14.200]  government's listening to phones they know what it is I mean it's just
[02:25:14.200 --> 02:25:19.480]  ridiculous and you know you heard that former senior secret service agent who
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:23.640]  ran the secret service operations when Obama went overseas I mean that's
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:27.680]  senior going up at the top of the ranks and the stuff he saw he had to get out
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:33.880]  of it and you heard him saying folks you are so naive if you don't know this is
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:40.520]  a mafia criminal government bipartisan you heard him on air it is so it's not
[02:25:40.520 --> 02:25:44.800]  some macho deal when I get up here on air and say this is what's going on and
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:49.720]  I'm going all the way it's a decision you have to make I am not living on my
[02:25:49.720 --> 02:25:55.440]  knees sucking boots of a bunch of thugs and I want to tell everybody serving
[02:25:55.440 --> 02:25:59.520]  the evil system something you're gonna get bit in the butt by this it these
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:04.200]  tyrannies have you studied history 100% of the time run wild and burn
[02:26:04.200 --> 02:26:16.600]  everything down politically and it's just extremely frustrating to have all
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:21.400]  the numbers in the data and to know how all this stuff works and to just realize
[02:26:21.400 --> 02:26:25.520]  people hear this show and they think I'm nuts half the time and and I am a
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:29.000]  little eccentric because of all the stuff I know it's done a lot of stuff
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:35.440]  it's done a lot of things to me it's a regular guy in person but what I say on
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:40.520]  air is not half as bad as it really is I mean it's it's just it's so
[02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:47.280]  unbelievable how evil the government is and just the way it is chewing through
[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:55.760]  everything now and following that nightmare historical pattern that it
[02:26:55.760 --> 02:27:02.080]  always follows it's travel route and I'm just sitting here watching the travel
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:06.520]  route fallen right to hell and I see a lot of people waking up and that's good
[02:27:06.520 --> 02:27:10.000]  but you just want it to wake up faster so that we don't have to go down this
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:13.320]  road I mean I don't even want to cover this next story and I'm gonna get to
[02:27:13.320 --> 02:27:22.800]  and come back from break but we got to do it we're gonna do it because it makes
[02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:25.920]  me think about all the other innocence that are crying out for help right now
[02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:30.560]  crying out to God for help and God God tries to move the hearts of men and
[02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:34.800]  women to go do the right thing to protect these people we are the hand of
[02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:39.560]  God ladies and gentlemen on this earth we take the right direction God will give
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:44.840]  us providence but we are we are the hand of God God's hand works through us and
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:51.200]  that's why we're in so much evil is because we are evil I am evil I have
[02:27:51.200 --> 02:27:57.000]  not done enough so that's why when I hear about new evil and stuff I feel like
[02:27:57.000 --> 02:28:03.200]  I've done it I feel like I haven't done enough I feel like when my instinct is
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.920]  to go even further against these people and am I being a coward and am I
[02:28:06.920 --> 02:28:12.520]  rationalizing to myself about you know how I prosecute this war against the
[02:28:12.520 --> 02:28:16.240]  enemy and the fact that I'm human and joke around and goof off and stuff
[02:28:16.240 --> 02:28:22.280]  because I work too much and I can be a screwball but you can't expect somebody
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:27.560]  who's been doing this 18 years to not not have some idiosyncratic tics I mean
[02:28:27.560 --> 02:28:34.960]  I just it's like that Narls Barkley saw me we can come back from break with it
[02:28:34.960 --> 02:28:40.560]  yeah I was crazy not because I didn't know enough it was because I knew too

[02:34:13.760 --> 02:34:22.760]  titled Texas town kills two-year-old toddler because parents smoked pot and
[02:34:22.760 --> 02:34:31.640]  if you watch the video it's it's it's it's very very clear and I even made some
[02:34:31.640 --> 02:34:37.720]  notes this morning about what I wanted to say about this subject specifically
[02:34:37.720 --> 02:34:43.320]  who took the child away the state who paid for the care of the child the
[02:34:43.320 --> 02:34:47.320]  state who inspected the children in the home the state who wouldn't give
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:50.720]  information to the father when he said she was being beat up and hurt the state
[02:34:50.720 --> 02:34:55.920]  why was the two-year-old baby who'd never been to the hospital never hadn't
[02:34:55.920 --> 02:35:00.640]  been a doctor's visit to be sick who took the little girl away from the father
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:06.520]  and mother the state because someone had smelled marijuana before and so they
[02:35:06.520 --> 02:35:10.200]  went and visited the rest of the family and reportedly the sister said yeah my
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:15.800]  brother smokes pot and then the state came and said oh just give us the child
[02:35:15.800 --> 02:35:19.440]  sign these papers we'll give her back to you months later that didn't happen the
[02:35:19.440 --> 02:35:22.800]  poor father and mother still thought they were gonna get her back you don't
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:29.080]  get blonde-haired blue-eyed babies back folks they can get a half mil for him it's
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:33.960]  a hellish sentence for him a lot of times they end up going to at least to a
[02:35:33.960 --> 02:35:37.040]  nice family but you better hope they get out of the foster care while they're
[02:35:37.040 --> 02:35:42.120]  lining that up see first they have to terminate the parental rights and so the
[02:35:42.120 --> 02:35:45.160]  parents are fighting to get their kid back it might take a year till they're
[02:35:45.160 --> 02:35:50.440]  permanently gotten rid of the names changed or whatever or manipulated the
[02:35:50.440 --> 02:35:54.640]  social security numbers and then the child goes on to the next family in
[02:35:54.640 --> 02:36:00.960]  another state and while their warehouse ladies and gentlemen they die and we
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:05.520]  have Justice Department's own numbers you are seven times even Time Magazine of
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:09.440]  all places has admitted this more likely to get hurt or killed or abused in
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:13.040]  foster care than any other place does that mean there aren't some nice foster
[02:36:13.040 --> 02:36:16.640]  parents somewhere out there yes there are but by and large and I cleaned
[02:36:16.640 --> 02:36:23.360]  carpets for a for a summer and so I learned what are these places these are
[02:36:23.360 --> 02:36:27.560]  these are foster homes it'd be a regular house just like you see in a
[02:36:27.560 --> 02:36:31.320]  neighborhood but there'd be ten kids in it living on dirty mattresses look like
[02:36:31.320 --> 02:36:36.960]  they're starving to death with some fat pedophile type pothead wandering around
[02:36:36.960 --> 02:36:40.560]  I just say that because it always seemed to smell of marijuana and you could
[02:36:40.560 --> 02:36:43.520]  tell these kids were not in a good place they'd always look freaked out there'd
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:50.600]  be cat piss all over the place and that's why I had to quit being a carpet
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:53.160]  cleaner was almost like being an ambulance driver for folks I've talked to
[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:57.000]  I don't like going and trashy people's houses with their fleas seeing their beat
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:37:00.960]  up kids you name it I mean it's it must be horrible to be a police officer I have
[02:37:00.960 --> 02:37:04.840]  to see this stuff I don't want to go in people's houses it was disgusting I love
[02:37:04.840 --> 02:37:07.920]  going to nice fancy houses we just moved the furniture and cleaned it a lot of
[02:37:07.920 --> 02:37:11.640]  times you'd go to a house where you know some dog had died locked up for a month
[02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:14.920]  and they were trying to sell it and they weren't gonna jerk the carpet out you
[02:37:14.920 --> 02:37:17.520]  have to clean it see I'm having flashbacks to that but let's go to the
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:20.960]  Daily Mail article that came out after our article yesterday but it got more of
[02:37:20.960 --> 02:37:27.640]  the photos let's look at this poor little victim two-year-old Alexandria Hill
[02:37:27.640 --> 02:37:32.220]  died on Wednesday the 31st of July two days after she was admitted to the
[02:37:32.220 --> 02:37:36.720]  hospital in Texas and went to Boston and round around suffering a serious brain
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:41.440]  injury and she'd come for once a week visit with her family with mildew on her
[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:47.000]  black eyes hair falling out beat up begging to be with them and boy let's
[02:37:47.000 --> 02:37:50.560]  look at the troll below that for TV viewers who's been charged with kill with
[02:37:50.560 --> 02:37:56.040]  a bachelor brains in sherry small man I tell you that's exactly what I said the
[02:37:56.040 --> 02:38:00.520]  men looked like that the women looked like that of the foster parents that I
[02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:06.600]  mean what I saw was was bad and these little kids needed love they come they
[02:38:06.600 --> 02:38:09.960]  could tell if you were a nice person they come over try to talk to you cut I've
[02:38:09.960 --> 02:38:13.960]  just seen it all and and let me explain something if you're a good family and the
[02:38:13.960 --> 02:38:17.000]  neighbor lies and they come and there's dog here on the floor your kids are
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:22.040]  gone if your child falls off a jungle gym at school and there's witnesses your
[02:38:22.040 --> 02:38:26.280]  kids are gone if your child falls and bust their tooth on the parking lot your
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:33.080]  your child is gone in many cases and there are real social services out there
[02:38:33.080 --> 02:38:36.480]  for old people that I know that do good jobs they're trying to change that with
[02:38:36.480 --> 02:38:40.280]  the death panels and stuff now there are good there there are some good overall
[02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:44.920]  family people but the CPS itself has about a 50% turnover rate each year
[02:38:44.920 --> 02:38:48.000]  because people get into it for the right reasons and find out how evil it is and
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:53.520]  get out it is a federal mandate to get more kids consecutively since Clinton
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:59.600]  got the legislation passed in the mid 90s they grab over a million 100,000
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:03.600]  children a year in this country and and hundreds and hundreds of thousands get
[02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:07.920]  taken away and I've seen it if you're in a cracked in with flies and feces all
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:14.600]  over you they're not taking you if you've got black hair and green eyes you
[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:19.800]  could be a brain surgeon doctor they're gonna take your kid raven hair green
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:24.760]  eyes there people pay millions for that blonde hair blue eyes the main target
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:32.320]  half a mil okay I mean babies from China are hundreds of thousands babies from
[02:39:32.320 --> 02:39:36.920]  South Korea hundreds of thousands I know my sisters adopted from Korea okay
[02:39:36.920 --> 02:39:41.280]  ladies and gentlemen and the whole point here is this is a bigger business than
[02:39:41.280 --> 02:39:48.600]  drugs and Dinecore that's on record running child kidnapping rings all over
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:53.120]  the world is the biggest CPS provider in Texas with their contractors we haven't
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:56.520]  even looked at that yet who she was contracted by we know the the front group
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:40:00.520]  you know the local group up there so the worst place for children is in these

[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:16.520]  the parents are better in almost every case statistically than in the hands of
[02:40:16.520 --> 02:40:20.640]  the CPS so the police the judges they all know it's a racket and they all know
[02:40:20.640 --> 02:40:24.960]  this okay and they always use the crisis to get more funds and more CPS

[02:40:36.200 --> 02:40:40.840]  screw up see in America and under the globalist system you screw up you get
[02:40:40.840 --> 02:40:45.600]  more funds they're all over the news raising money for CPS and saying title
[02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:50.720]  on more parents over this dead girl they use everything they do to take more of
[02:40:50.720 --> 02:40:55.280]  our rights and again we've gone and gotten the affidavit and gone over all
[02:40:55.280 --> 02:41:00.600]  of it investigation started with a report of marijuana then it turned into the
[02:41:00.600 --> 02:41:04.960]  child being taken people don't know when you go to have a baby and let's say you

[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:32.320]  marijuana okay I have smoked before to particularly like it the point is I've
[02:41:32.320 --> 02:41:36.040]  looked at the medical info this is the persecution you got over a hundred
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:39.160]  million Americans that smoke marijuana on average once a week do they all
[02:41:39.160 --> 02:41:41.840]  deserve to have their kids taken because I'll tell you what really makes me sick
[02:41:41.840 --> 02:41:46.040]  on the YouTube and let's actually go to the YouTube page if we can or I can go
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:49.400]  to it of this video report I followed from the news last night that then got
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:55.520]  posted to YouTube that that needs to go viral I'm gonna send this back out on

[02:42:07.800 --> 02:42:11.080]  tracked back that appear to work for the state of Texas and Williamson County
[02:42:11.080 --> 02:42:16.440]  because I did profile searches under their names under their handles they're
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:20.680]  in there going good take all the potheds kids they deserve it hey listen you may
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:23.800]  have this culture of hating potheds because it's like the demonized group

[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:32.160]  camps to build wedges and stuff I get that and I get how corrupt Williamson
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:36.400]  County is but this is a dead two-year-old little girl who was tortured
[02:42:36.400 --> 02:42:39.880]  pretty hardcore for months before she finally mercifully had her brains
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:44.400]  bashed out we're gonna go ahead and show people an image of her on life support
[02:42:44.400 --> 02:42:51.360]  or they turned her off you know with the respirator you people are sick and
[02:42:51.360 --> 02:42:56.320]  Williamson County with a lot of famous cases is known nationwide as a really
[02:42:56.320 --> 02:43:00.360]  evil place and they've told me years ago they ever catch me in the town it's

[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:15.920]  monthly Michael Morton I've been covering this case for a decade before it was a
[02:43:15.920 --> 02:43:19.800]  big national case or making a big movie out of it he was wrongly convicted in
[02:43:19.800 --> 02:43:25.080]  87 and it turned out the prosecutors knew he was innocent a father no criminal
[02:43:25.080 --> 02:43:28.520]  record wife brutally tortured murder they found the bloody bandana of the
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:31.760]  known serial killer and it turned out they even knew once the guy was in
[02:43:31.760 --> 02:43:35.560]  prison he admitted he did it and cat tried to keep this man in jail they
[02:43:35.560 --> 02:43:40.560]  wanted to put him in jail because he was a good guy and now they're getting
[02:43:40.560 --> 02:43:44.120]  ready to indict that was in the news that's in my stack Michael Morton
[02:43:44.120 --> 02:43:47.240]  prosecutor will face criminal charges for withholding evidence boom there you go
[02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:50.920]  by the way the judge that did all this is still up there right now and this is
[02:43:50.920 --> 02:43:53.920]  going all over the country but let me tell you Williamson County is like a
[02:43:53.920 --> 02:43:59.760]  satanic boss hog area you got a bunch of naive snowbirds and people there and
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:03.920]  then you got a wicked government folks so I recommend you no one go there or
[02:44:03.920 --> 02:44:07.760]  get near it it's literally more door to the north and Austin's got problems but
[02:44:07.760 --> 02:44:12.120]  I mean let me tell you something cops you took a little girl I don't care how
[02:44:12.120 --> 02:44:15.640]  much flak you throw up on the CPS is like well they asked for our help what
[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:19.600]  once you came and said we're gonna help you sign these forms and then they took
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:23.800]  the girl they always try to try that psiop to dealing with these liars let's
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:28.800]  go to my little report on this and we're all to blame not just the people on
[02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:33.000]  Williamson County all of us for letting this evil go on that is the child
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:37.160]  protective racket let's go to the video imagine you're a happy family living in
[02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:43.400]  central Texas in a suburb of Austin round rock and one night you decide to
[02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:46.360]  smoke some marijuana after your two-year-old daughter has gone to bed
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:51.000]  while you watch a movie something over a hundred million Americans are
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:56.840]  estimated to do every single week a good secret police neighbor smells the
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:03.160]  marijuana calls the police and they come with the CPS and take your two-year-old
[02:45:03.160 --> 02:45:08.080]  happy daughter who'd never been in the hospital and never been sick and never
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:13.480]  been beaten up you go for weekly visits with your daughter and she's dirty
[02:45:13.480 --> 02:45:19.400]  she's confused she has black eyes bruises mold is growing on her body in
[02:45:19.400 --> 02:45:24.520]  her clothing you go to the state and say she's being abused help her and they
[02:45:24.520 --> 02:45:30.040]  laugh at you and a month later you get the call she's on life support her head
[02:45:30.040 --> 02:45:36.040]  has been caved in two days later they take her off life support and she dies
[02:45:36.040 --> 02:45:42.760]  another victim of this tyrannical government that we have that is
[02:45:42.760 --> 02:45:49.120]  incentivizing the states to seize as many children as they can over a million
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:54.720]  of them a year the Justice Department's own numbers show the horrific facts the
[02:45:54.720 --> 02:46:01.280]  most dangerous place a child can be is in state custody little Alexandria Hill
[02:46:01.280 --> 02:46:08.040]  or Alex as she was known will never get to grow up and be part of the spelling
[02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:11.800]  be at school or the swim team or softball she'll never get to go to
[02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:15.560]  college and meet the man of her dreams and have her own children and grandchildren
[02:46:15.560 --> 02:46:21.640]  she's dead another casualty of this sick society we have that has the largest
[02:46:21.640 --> 02:46:26.200]  prison population in the world every authoritarian state throughout history
[02:46:26.200 --> 02:46:30.280]  has been obsessed with attacking the family and seizing children from their
[02:46:30.280 --> 02:46:37.800]  parents Nazi Germany Soviet Russia Maoist China but they never did it on the
[02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:43.600]  scale that we see here in the United States and every day I see cases in
[02:46:43.600 --> 02:46:49.320]  Texas alone where people's children are taken for the most petty of reasons and
[02:46:49.320 --> 02:46:56.040]  end up dead raped tortured killed their heads caved in the children disappear
[02:46:56.040 --> 02:47:02.880]  routinely and end up overseas in snuff films and pornography our children are
[02:47:02.880 --> 02:47:08.040]  one of the favored commodities of the criminals that run our government and
[02:47:08.040 --> 02:47:13.640]  the people that are in control of Williamson County Texas are famous for
[02:47:13.640 --> 02:47:18.600]  their abuse of the innocent and famous for their abuse of children that they've
[02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:24.240]  kidnapped from their parents and I want to say something to the child
[02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:29.040]  predators in the police department in Williamson County and other areas in
[02:47:29.040 --> 02:47:35.480]  the United States when we take America back and we will you will be tried for
[02:47:35.480 --> 02:47:40.800]  your crimes against humanity you want to now charge one of the foster parents
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:46.880]  for supposedly caving this little girls head in you are just as guilty knowing
[02:47:46.880 --> 02:47:51.840]  how hellish those facilities and those homes are where they warehouse kids for
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:56.840]  money you know statistically there are more pedophiles and more abusers who
[02:47:56.840 --> 02:48:00.880]  literally torture those children with an inches of their life and that the state
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:06.040]  covers it up because it's part of a sick racket and you need to know that it's
[02:48:06.040 --> 02:48:11.120]  all on your head just like all the other cases in Williamson County where
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:17.080]  they've known people were innocent and known who killed people's wives and
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:22.640]  children and done nothing to prosecute the real criminals and gone after
[02:48:22.640 --> 02:48:28.080]  innocent people you will be charged for that crime as well and those charges are
[02:48:28.080 --> 02:48:32.920]  now forthcoming and you will be brought to justice in Williamson County and
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:37.480]  everywhere else for the crimes you've committed your tyranny can go on for a
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:43.680]  long time but sooner or later God is gonna cut you down you shouldn't fear
[02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:47.960]  Alex Jones you shouldn't even fear the American people you should fear God
[02:48:47.960 --> 02:48:55.800]  because God is real and God is the law you will be held in judgment for what
[02:48:55.800 --> 02:49:02.920]  you've done all of you the judges the police you are all accomplices in aiding
[02:49:02.920 --> 02:49:08.840]  and abetting the torturous death of children in Williamson County and across
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:13.480]  the United States and places like North Korea where they take families children
[02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:18.920]  as well for collectivization into the state for those of you who have only
[02:49:18.920 --> 02:49:26.040]  been passively involved in the industry that is the abuse of children at the
[02:49:26.040 --> 02:49:30.640]  hands of the state in this country there's still time for you to admit the
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:35.560]  facts and go public and speak out against this evil and turn the tide I
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:41.240]  will forgive you the parents of the abused and dead children will forgive you
[02:49:41.240 --> 02:49:48.080]  and most importantly the creator of the universe will forgive you and yes even
[02:49:48.080 --> 02:49:54.800]  little Alexandria Hill who is beyond your wicked grasp will forgive you as
[02:49:54.800 --> 02:50:01.880]  well join humanity and let us stop the modern slave trade in children that is
[02:50:01.880 --> 02:50:07.080]  taking place in this country and finally all of you out there watching
[02:50:07.080 --> 02:50:11.640]  there are children being kidnapped for the pettiest of reasons in your town

[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:24.360]  incredible miscarriage of justice where a stuzzy spy neighbor smells marijuana

[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:34.920]  family deserve to have their daughter killed in state custody because they
