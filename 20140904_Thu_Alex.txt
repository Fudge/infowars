[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:20.860]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.860 --> 00:35.020]  in the last two weeks massive news is broken in the alternative real free
[00:35.020 --> 00:44.920]  bricks high-level FDA whistleblowers coming forward about the cover-up of
[00:44.920 --> 00:50.320]  autism that they've known for decades is being triggered in great part it's a
[00:50.320 --> 00:55.820]  cocktail of reasons but in great part by autoimmune responses caused by
[00:55.820 --> 01:01.540]  vaccines and autoimmune disorders then being created in the brain and the gut
[01:01.540 --> 01:07.420]  of children and a scourge of neurological disorders John Rappaport will
[01:07.420 --> 01:12.080]  join us for about 40 minutes 20 minutes into the transmission in the second
[01:12.080 --> 01:18.060]  hour then we're gonna have Joe Biggs from El Paso he's got a lot of big breaking
[01:18.060 --> 01:24.660]  news dealing with the Homeland Security saying that they believe there is an
[01:24.660 --> 01:29.220]  imminent threat being planned and then an attack will take place they said that
[01:29.220 --> 01:34.460]  last Friday and again on Sunday in and around El Paso the Fort Bliss Joint
[01:34.460 --> 01:39.700]  Task Force 6 area I want to be clear I'm the guy that exposes false flag I'm the
[01:39.700 --> 01:45.940]  guy that officially began questioning 9-11 on the day of the event I see
[01:45.940 --> 01:49.020]  comments on Info War saying you know Alex why are you saying there there
[01:49.020 --> 01:52.260]  could be a real ISIS threat what wire you know it's gonna be a host gonna be a
[01:52.260 --> 01:58.180]  false flag well it is a false flag because ISIS has been empowered and
[01:58.180 --> 02:02.540]  funded by NATO and Homeland Security and they'll use an attack to take our
[02:02.540 --> 02:08.660]  liberties it does not mean there aren't jihadi nutballs that are coming to
[02:08.660 --> 02:15.940]  attack us see the media always spends it that that a false flag means it's
[02:15.940 --> 02:21.060]  totally staged by the government no elements of the government can fund
[02:21.060 --> 02:26.940]  terrorist and then let them attack that's what most false flags are is
[02:26.940 --> 02:31.100]  opening the door letting it happen look at how the British government was in
[02:31.100 --> 02:35.020]  the news two days ago he's gonna quote retrain the jihad he's coming back from
[02:35.020 --> 02:38.660]  Syria because huge amounts of them tens of thousands have come out of England
[02:38.660 --> 02:41.700]  they're allowed to fly in and out they're allowed to have Twitter and Facebook
[02:41.700 --> 02:50.140]  accounts they are being protected they're being protected here it's in the news
[02:50.140 --> 02:54.860]  today and my stack that'll that radical Islamist terrorists are using the open
[02:54.860 --> 02:59.540]  borders and the open visa program you can get a visa basically from any country
[02:59.540 --> 03:02.980]  in the world just come here and never leave and that and we are being
[03:02.980 --> 03:14.660]  infiltrated by people that are planning to blow stuff up and it will be used to
[03:14.660 --> 03:18.540]  set up checkpoints at malls everywhere else for the American people so I'm
[03:18.540 --> 03:24.540]  against it and it is a false flag anyway you cut it any way you slice it any way
[03:24.540 --> 03:33.780]  you dice it anyway yes it's staged but yes folks it could be a real attack and
[03:33.780 --> 03:40.820]  it could be bad they've got 15,000 stinger type impads service to air
[03:40.820 --> 03:45.660]  missiles I could just see the takedown of this country how they're gonna do it I

[04:08.900 --> 04:14.740]  ISIS is running wild our government armed ISIS to destabilize Syria Rand Paul
[04:14.740 --> 04:22.220]  was the one that criticized it he's the one proven correct but he they turn it
[04:22.220 --> 04:27.620]  around and spin it it's like ooh Matt Drudge you're discredited you said that
[04:27.620 --> 04:33.780]  there's a $5,000 fine if you don't get Obamacare ah ha when there is a $5,000

[08:59.500 --> 09:08.460]  fourth day of September 2014 Joe Biggs and our crew are down on the Texas
[09:08.460 --> 09:12.020]  border where Homeland Security is saying they believe an imminent credible
[09:12.020 --> 09:18.180]  threat of a ISIS al Qaeda attack will happen honor before September 11th in
[09:18.180 --> 09:24.060]  and around the Joint Task Force 6 military command center based outside

[09:32.780 --> 09:37.860]  third hour today there's also major whistleblowers from inside the
[09:37.860 --> 09:43.340]  government going public that there has been an ongoing cover-up at the CDC and
[09:43.340 --> 09:49.060]  the FDA that vaccines are indeed one of the big factors triggering the huge
[09:49.060 --> 09:56.300]  upsurge from 1 in 25,000 30 years ago to now 1 in 56 North American children
[09:56.300 --> 10:01.580]  developing neurological disorders in the autism spectrum now if you'll remember
[10:01.580 --> 10:07.500]  back in 2000 it was leaked in 2004 there was a secret CDC meeting in the
[10:07.500 --> 10:11.220]  minutes were released with the director and all the top scientists more than 50
[10:11.220 --> 10:15.140]  of them in the room concluding that it is triggering autoimmune disorder in the
[10:15.140 --> 10:23.260]  brain and that it is literally causing a giant problem and that they should not
[10:23.260 --> 10:27.180]  give it to their families and the CDC director said I will tell my granddaughter
[10:27.180 --> 10:33.420]  not to give it to my children my grandchildren I will tell my daughter
[10:33.420 --> 10:38.660]  not to give it to my grandchildren that was even on ABC news at the time so this
[10:38.660 --> 10:43.580]  stuff's come out before then they'll run hoax is saying Dr. Wakefield
[10:43.580 --> 10:48.500]  discredited with fake research in England linking it to this and then the
[10:48.500 --> 10:53.500]  media all says he's discredited and that he was caught and then he now suing and
[10:53.500 --> 10:58.220]  basically winning that lawsuit proving that it was all a fraud they could come
[10:58.220 --> 11:03.340]  out with a hoax tomorrow claiming that I robbed banks ladies and gentlemen it's
[11:03.340 --> 11:07.780]  not going to be true or that I said kill Michelle Malkin turned out that was it
[11:07.780 --> 11:12.060]  true or that I was behind the Boston bombing they've said that before with
[11:12.060 --> 11:18.540]  no proof or that I'm deeply racist or blah blah blah or that I've died or that
[11:18.540 --> 11:24.020]  I'm in a sex tape or that I'm not really who I say I am this is the type of stuff
[11:24.020 --> 11:30.180]  they do to anybody who they don't like they had Democrats twice dress up like
[11:30.180 --> 11:36.260]  Klan members and show up at Rand Paul rallies when he was winning his Senate
[11:36.260 --> 11:41.620]  race and then we and others went and searched their faces they had their
[11:41.620 --> 11:45.860]  you know their faces open and found through Google image search that they
[11:45.860 --> 11:51.660]  were Democratic Party officials low-level minions and they do this all the
[11:51.660 --> 11:59.300]  time I'm just saying people have got to be aware of these dirty tricks people
[11:59.300 --> 12:05.700]  have got to be aware of the type of stunts that get pulled out there now
[12:05.700 --> 12:13.300]  where to start today there is just so much to go through I love how all over
[12:13.300 --> 12:19.820]  CNN and MSNBC there's a full court press to get demonstrations going all over
[12:19.820 --> 12:36.540]  the United States today promoting $15 an hour minimum wage and Kurt Nemo has
[12:36.540 --> 12:41.740]  the headline in infowars.com fight for $15 minimum wage is a fight for
[12:41.740 --> 12:46.500]  compulsory unemployment that's absolutely true if you understand the
[12:46.500 --> 12:50.660]  economics Kurt Nemo breaks it down the article just went live minutes ago in
[12:50.660 --> 12:57.460]  infowars.com the globalist bring in unlimited undocumented illegal
[12:57.460 --> 13:02.300]  aliens we've got major studies out today showing that they got the majority of
[13:02.300 --> 13:08.660]  new jobs in some states all the new jobs like Tennessee and that they will then
[13:08.660 --> 13:15.980]  work for illegal below minimum wage levels get welfare supplement and that
[13:15.980 --> 13:25.060]  then drives down wages overall but also taxes the welfare system so you've got
[13:25.060 --> 13:29.940]  the Democrats and the unions openly lobbying for unlimited illegals to
[13:29.940 --> 13:34.580]  come in to drive down the wages and then they complain and say let's raise the
[13:34.580 --> 13:41.380]  wages compulsory which will only cause layoffs of people who are working
[13:41.380 --> 13:44.980]  legally and lawfully in the system with benefits because I want to explain
[13:44.980 --> 13:50.420]  something to people that don't employ when you pay someone $15 an hour when
[13:50.420 --> 13:55.260]  you pay the FICA and the Social Security and the payroll taxes and all of it on
[13:55.260 --> 14:01.260]  average it's higher in some states but I'm in Texas if somebody's paid $15 an
[14:01.260 --> 14:07.140]  hour you're really paying them about $22 an hour if somebody's getting paid
[14:07.140 --> 14:14.860]  $20 an hour you're basically paying them $29 an hour so you cannot afford in
[14:14.860 --> 14:22.420]  this economy in many operations out there to pay someone $15 because it's
[14:22.420 --> 14:30.420]  really 20 something and that's not even adding in all the other regulations and
[14:30.420 --> 14:36.660]  taxes notice that Obamacare raises payroll taxes notice that Obamacare puts
[14:36.660 --> 14:41.860]  huge taxes on businesses and it's caused giant waves of layoffs notice Obamacare
[14:41.860 --> 14:47.220]  makes you get people health care if they have more than 30 hours so across the
[14:47.220 --> 14:52.100]  nation we saw a massive increase in people going to part-time so then they
[14:52.100 --> 14:56.500]  went out and got multiple jobs which they count as new jobs and then try to
[14:56.500 --> 15:02.420]  say oh look we've added 20 million new jobs no you've actually cut people so
[15:02.420 --> 15:06.540]  they had to go get a second or third job so when you know the real economics
[15:06.540 --> 15:14.340]  it's a total screw job on working poor which is designed to make you just go
[15:14.340 --> 15:19.780]  ahead and give up and go get on welfare or disability because you can get a
[15:19.780 --> 15:26.420]  better deal there than working and then you add all the county and city and
[15:26.420 --> 15:33.020]  health taxes and regulations and and VATs and sales taxes and environmental
[15:33.020 --> 15:40.700]  taxes it is unbelievable that the average business owner in Texas pays
[15:40.700 --> 15:46.940]  around 70% one way or another into taxes you go to somewhere like New York it's
[15:46.940 --> 15:56.220]  over 80% San Francisco over 80% unless you're a fat cat like Nancy Pelosi that
[15:56.220 --> 16:00.500]  owns restaurants and hotels all over California they literally write bills
[16:00.500 --> 16:06.140]  federally on the state level exempting themselves from everything Warren Buffett
[16:06.140 --> 16:12.300]  is exempt from basically everything Nancy Pelosi exempt basically from
[16:12.300 --> 16:18.900]  everything Al Gore exempt general electric Google exempt
[16:18.900 --> 16:27.060]  Lehman Brothers exempt Wells Fargo exempt Bank of America exempt general
[16:27.060 --> 16:37.060]  motors exempt exempt exempt exempt exempt exempt exempt they don't play by the
[16:37.060 --> 16:43.020]  same rules that's the real discrimination cultural discrimination they
[16:43.020 --> 16:47.300]  hype up all day racial stuff because the globalists just want to fighting with
[16:47.300 --> 16:49.900]  each other and sure there's some racial issues going on out there and
[16:49.900 --> 16:53.700]  religious issues there always has been people are tribal people getting clicks
[16:53.700 --> 17:00.940]  big deal grow up get over it but the big discrimination that you can't get around
[17:00.940 --> 17:06.380]  is the globalists write the laws for high taxes on the little guy because they
[17:06.380 --> 17:12.940]  don't want competition and that's why I harp on that every single day
[17:13.700 --> 17:18.580]  Obama is allowed to get about a third or more of his donations it's come out in
[17:18.580 --> 17:23.100]  the news from foreign illegal donors and publicly have foreign fundraisers with
[17:23.100 --> 17:28.100]  foreigners attending paying $20,000 a plate
[17:29.100 --> 17:35.140]  Obama is allowed to have them on MSNBC lobbying to have illegals give my
[17:35.140 --> 17:42.300]  Democratic Party and give illegals driver's license and
[17:42.740 --> 17:47.540]  meanwhile Dinesh DeSousa headline Reuters humiliated Dinesh DeSousa
[17:47.540 --> 17:58.300]  seeks probation after guilty plea for getting friends to give $10,000 each to
[17:58.300 --> 18:06.540]  a senatorial campaign of a friend that's right so so again think about how all
[18:06.540 --> 18:10.660]  this operates he's not exempt from the campaign finance laws you understand
[18:10.660 --> 18:15.940]  that and see if you can exempt yourself from the regulations you put on others
[18:15.940 --> 18:19.980]  you put everyone else at a disadvantage you've rigged the game like a Don King
[18:19.980 --> 18:25.900]  boxing match like a mafia run horse race and that's the end of a free market
[18:25.900 --> 18:30.500]  that's the end of prosperity and that's our biggest enemy in this country is the
[18:30.500 --> 18:36.260]  elites have gained the whole system and now they've got all these fools out
[18:36.260 --> 18:42.340]  there wanting to raise the minimum wage from eight bucks or whatever it is up to
[18:42.340 --> 18:51.100]  15 doubling it and all that'll do is cut the unemployment it'll cut the people
[18:51.100 --> 18:55.380]  that are working and put more people into unemployment it'll bankrupt the
[18:55.380 --> 19:01.980]  system further and it will also cause more inflation and of course at some
[19:01.980 --> 19:05.860]  point you're going to have to say that you know you have to raise the wages just
[19:05.860 --> 19:09.540]  by the market factors because the dollars being devalued so much you're
[19:09.540 --> 19:14.220]  gonna need $15 an hour just to survive if you pay the taxes if you jump through
[19:14.220 --> 19:20.540]  all the hoops but the average working poor person has all the taxes hidden in

[24:36.660 --> 24:42.340]  enforcement quote I doubt they are installed by law enforcement as they
[24:42.340 --> 24:45.980]  require a warrant to intercept conversations or data and since the
[24:45.980 --> 24:50.940]  cell providers are ordered by the court to cooperate with the intercept they
[24:50.940 --> 24:57.100]  really would be no need for this rice said that CBS2 security analyst rose
[24:57.100 --> 25:04.540]  rice a former CIA agent former FBI agent said it's likely being used
[25:04.540 --> 25:13.060]  illegally I'm going to read that again CBS2 security analyst Ross Rice a former
[25:13.060 --> 25:19.060]  FBI agent said it's likely being used illegally quote I doubt that they are
[25:19.060 --> 25:23.300]  installed by law enforcement as they require a warrant to intercept
[25:23.300 --> 25:28.300]  conversations or data and since the cell providers are ordered by the court to
[25:28.300 --> 25:34.780]  cooperate with the intercept there really would be no need for this rice
[25:34.780 --> 25:39.500]  said most likely they are installed and operated by hackers trying to steal
[25:39.500 --> 25:45.620]  personal identification passwords less goldsmith of CEO of ESD America which
[25:45.620 --> 25:49.500]  makes secure cell phones said law enforcement with a warrant can use
[25:49.500 --> 25:53.020]  interceptor devices if they need information in real time or if they
[25:53.020 --> 25:59.260]  don't want a cellular network to know that they are being tracked the devices
[25:59.260 --> 26:04.100]  don't look like a tower but are rather electronic boxes and laptops that trick
[26:04.100 --> 26:10.540]  a regular phone that isn't part of the actual cellular network how did ESD
[26:10.540 --> 26:14.860]  customers discover the interceptor devices ESD American cell phone protects
[26:14.860 --> 26:18.980]  users and it goes on to basically be an infomercial for this company let's stop
[26:18.980 --> 26:23.540]  right there let's just stop right there this is so frustrating because I could
[26:23.540 --> 26:26.900]  barely read that article because so much stuff was coming up in my mind as I read
[26:26.900 --> 26:32.100]  it because I know all the answers only because I'm focused on this I'm not
[26:32.100 --> 26:37.860]  bragging it's just I absolutely know what's going on from A to Z with this
[26:37.860 --> 26:45.020]  and either that FBI agent that former FBI agent is either completely ignorant
[26:45.020 --> 26:52.020]  or was an FBI agent 10 15 years ago because it's all open-source known what's
[26:52.020 --> 26:59.380]  going on what would everyone like me to tell you what's going on we had a
[26:59.380 --> 27:04.220]  leaker inside known to us inside the Seattle government I'll just say that
[27:04.220 --> 27:09.340]  I won't say it was state or city but out of Seattle that sent us to the secret
[27:09.340 --> 27:18.460]  diagrams earlier this year in January of the new cell towers they don't look
[27:18.460 --> 27:25.060]  like cell towers but cell boxes hidden inside transformers you name it with
[27:25.060 --> 27:29.380]  cameras microphones but most importantly their own cell system to grab
[27:29.380 --> 27:34.460]  everything and it wires through the threat fusion center with the local
[27:34.460 --> 27:39.580]  police and homeland security now I'm gonna explain something since at least
[27:39.580 --> 27:46.500]  1998 this has been in place in Austin Texas microphones hidden you name it
[27:46.500 --> 27:53.940]  after I exposed it was in the front page of the paper in 1998 Chicago's got it
[27:53.940 --> 27:59.500]  New York Boston they've spent over five billion dollars in Boston alone more
[27:59.500 --> 28:07.900]  than even New York I don't know why since the 90s putting these babies in in
[28:07.900 --> 28:12.860]  one federal grant for Boston if it was like six seven years ago it was two
[28:12.860 --> 28:19.940]  billion dollars in microphones and cameras and illegal cell towers it is
[28:19.940 --> 28:24.340]  illegal so you got some former FBI agent going oh we wouldn't do that that's
[28:24.340 --> 28:29.540]  illegal give me a break now does that mean there aren't hackers putting up
[28:29.540 --> 28:34.540]  their own fake stuff and their own wireless networks grabbing the data
[28:34.540 --> 28:40.700]  absolutely that's going on does that mean there aren't criminals and
[28:40.700 --> 28:43.780]  corporations and foreign governments doing it no there's a bunch of people
[28:43.780 --> 28:50.140]  doing it it is a free for all when you put your stuff on the cloud when you use
[28:50.140 --> 28:54.020]  a cell phone you might as well be standing on the top of a roof screaming
[28:54.020 --> 29:01.060]  everything out at a sports stadium with a bullhorn with voice print everything
[29:01.060 --> 29:06.540]  okay it's all being listened to it's all designed to be as easily grabbed as
[29:06.540 --> 29:11.380]  possible because they don't want to have to break encryption the only
[29:11.380 --> 29:15.660]  encryption algorithm is to crunch the data and they've all got the keys to
[29:15.660 --> 29:20.460]  that the keys are public the globalist to put the keys out they want Pandora's
[29:20.460 --> 29:25.500]  box to be so wide open and everything and and surveillance to be so ubiquitous
[29:25.500 --> 29:29.980]  that by the time it's announced to the slaves it'll be too late now we come
[29:29.980 --> 29:35.420]  back I'm gonna finish breaking this down but mckelthalin wrote two articles
[29:35.420 --> 29:40.980]  about it it just makes me want to throw up gee what are all these cell towers
[29:40.980 --> 29:46.380]  grabbing them that's illegal it can't be the government yes 98% of it is the
[29:46.380 --> 29:51.940]  degenerate government we're on the way go the empire is not to stop radical

[33:41.620 --> 33:48.540]  don't do things like secretly grabbed at it illegally we get warrants that's like
[33:48.540 --> 33:54.460]  saying that sailors don't sail on ships I mean it's just the way they talk to the

[34:17.700 --> 34:26.700]  now people on average do not believe everything's fine but we're told that
[34:26.700 --> 34:30.500]  we're all being spied on because of al-qaeda when our own government's been
[34:30.500 --> 34:33.660]  arming them all over the world and there's an article up on info wars dot
[34:33.660 --> 34:40.100]  com the Obama administration policies that jihadists are using to legally
[34:40.100 --> 34:44.540]  immigrate to America did you know that one of the Americans that was recently
[34:44.540 --> 34:50.100]  killed fighting for ISIS once cleaned planes at Minneapolis St. Paul
[34:50.100 --> 34:58.060]  International Airport and the article links to the documents did you know they
[34:58.060 --> 35:04.180]  just got 11 large wide-body passenger jets at the Tripoli Airport and now the
[35:04.180 --> 35:11.540]  planes have disappeared I'm gonna say that again when our government was
[35:11.540 --> 35:16.260]  funding and beefing up al-qaeda in Iraq and al-qaeda in Syria that's what they
[35:16.260 --> 35:20.140]  called themselves and the al-Nusra brigades all of them they wave black
[35:20.140 --> 35:27.620]  flags that are the symbol of Wahhabism with Wahhabist slogans do you understand
[35:27.620 --> 35:37.220]  this is al-qaeda this is al-qaeda's daddy not its baby and they're real and
[35:37.220 --> 35:41.820]  there's hundreds of thousands of them and it was in the British newspapers on
[35:41.820 --> 35:47.980]  Monday and we covered it here that the British government's gonna reeducate
[35:47.980 --> 35:52.220]  the jihadis when they come back that's right British citizens are allowed to
[35:52.220 --> 35:57.980]  board planes give money go fight for ISIS shop Christian heads off and then
[35:57.980 --> 36:02.220]  come back and then they get given a course you know like if you beat your
[36:02.220 --> 36:06.140]  wife you go to a course four or five times or you get caught drinking and
[36:06.140 --> 36:12.980]  driving it's the same thing they're gonna get a social worker course and then
[36:12.980 --> 36:19.740]  this article breaks down the open border policies that let these guys come in and
[36:19.740 --> 36:23.700]  out of the country in a survey conducted by pure research the wall street
[36:23.700 --> 36:37.620]  journal and the information released by the Minneapolis newspaper I'm here
[36:37.620 --> 36:44.300]  looking at the sources this is just daily caller world that daily
[36:44.300 --> 36:55.580]  Minneapolis St. Paul paper it makes me want to throw up that our border is wide
[36:55.580 --> 37:04.780]  open and they have got government finance cell phone towers up all over the
[37:04.780 --> 37:11.380]  place illegally grabbing all of our data running it through and the argument
[37:11.380 --> 37:14.780]  by Homeland Security when you read the Congressional funding two years ago to
[37:14.780 --> 37:18.460]  put in the next wave of the stuff nationwide in every city in town

[37:48.980 --> 37:53.260]  to be given to the police once they sell it to the public at the threat fusion
[37:53.260 --> 37:59.020]  center level and beyond grabbing all data public and private and running it
[37:59.020 --> 38:05.620]  through into consoles and the police cars and then headset helmets and Google
[38:05.620 --> 38:10.180]  glasses and it breaks down the whole thing being beta tested in Austin Texas
[38:10.180 --> 38:16.980]  Seattle Washington Chicago Illinois Boston Massachusetts New York New York
[38:16.980 --> 38:24.500]  Miami Florida Los Angeles San Francisco I mean we have all the documents we know
[38:24.500 --> 38:30.100]  exactly what these mystery boxes are we know who's grabbing the cell phone data
[38:30.100 --> 38:35.900]  we know why it's causing all the drop calls we have people inside okay who
[38:35.900 --> 38:41.820]  run the things in major cities telling us exactly what's going on I've had to
[38:41.820 --> 38:47.620]  put reporters on airplanes to fly and meet with these people we know okay
[38:47.620 --> 38:54.180]  they've got laser coupling systems in major cities where they shoot basically
[38:54.180 --> 38:57.820]  white light invisible lasers you can't even see them during the day to your
[38:57.820 --> 39:02.780]  window and they can listen everything going on in your house they can they can
[39:02.780 --> 39:11.060]  shoot it at a paper bag in your front yard and then bounce the the sound waves
[39:11.060 --> 39:16.060]  off the window off the paper bag and then technically say they're not aiming
[39:16.060 --> 39:22.900]  it at your window and even get around having a warrant but forget that
[39:22.900 --> 39:30.820]  parallel construction parallel construction is what I told you about
[39:30.820 --> 39:35.340]  years ago I was told by insiders over a decade ago that listen every major
[39:35.340 --> 39:38.900]  agency has access to everything lifetime they don't give it to junior and
[39:38.900 --> 39:42.940]  mid-level people because they might blow the whistle on how illegal it is but
[39:42.940 --> 39:47.060]  it's a giant criminal revolution against our privacy and our freedom not for
[39:47.060 --> 39:51.340]  our security but for a domestic takeover by globalist with the inside info
[39:51.340 --> 39:56.420]  there it is MIT develops tech to record conversations using inanimate objects
[39:56.420 --> 40:02.500]  including a paper bag in your yard including leaves these algorithms are
[40:02.500 --> 40:07.180]  so powerful folks that leaves in a tree are picking up sound waves through your
[40:07.180 --> 40:12.500]  window so they just aim the laser at the leaf and then the computer dials in
[40:12.500 --> 40:17.100]  till it picks up what you're saying and doing right out of the the Joker Batman
[40:17.100 --> 40:22.700]  movie where we're only going to use the sonar on these cell phones one time to
[40:22.700 --> 40:29.580]  tune it to the voice of the Joker and finding they actually have that 20 years
[40:29.580 --> 40:33.340]  ago they had infrared satellites where they would pick up the signature your
[40:33.340 --> 40:38.860]  shoulders the top of your head and track everywhere you went they already have
[40:38.860 --> 40:42.220]  this worldwide folks they could control the borders they could control
[40:42.220 --> 40:50.420]  everything they don't want to it's all completely illegal and so imagine people
[40:50.420 --> 40:54.180]  are noticing these these weird cell boxes and these things grabbing their
[40:54.180 --> 40:57.460]  data and they're wondering who's breaking into their computers it's come out the
[40:57.460 --> 41:03.300]  FBI has put out almost every major virus worm that's infected in some cases
[41:03.300 --> 41:08.500]  hundreds of millions of computers to quote find one bad guy we were just
[41:08.500 --> 41:12.220]  infecting you know hundreds of millions of computers to catch one bad guy and we
[41:12.220 --> 41:16.460]  finally caught him three years later with the technology knowing he'd open
[41:16.460 --> 41:23.020]  it someday no they attacked all the networks they stole the data and then
[41:23.020 --> 41:27.460]  gave you some story how they I mean it's just it's ridiculous
[41:27.460 --> 41:33.300]  meanwhile our government is funding is to murder over 200,000 Christians
[41:33.300 --> 41:39.620]  chopping their heads off murdering little children over a hundred thousand
[41:39.620 --> 41:45.140]  non-radical Muslims 300,000 look it up conservative number in Syria I'm gonna
[41:45.140 --> 41:51.820]  say it again the people that run our government want jihadis chopping
[41:51.820 --> 41:58.620]  Christians heads off are these good people this grid is not to keep you
[41:58.620 --> 42:03.740]  safe you can dress up like a summit bin Laden and walk across the border all day
[42:03.740 --> 42:09.180]  long right in front of military bases why do I know we've now done it videos
[42:09.180 --> 42:14.820]  coming you can dress up like Al Qaeda run around chopping heads off in front of
[42:14.820 --> 42:20.060]  military bases and nothing happens simulated headchoppings nothing happens
[42:20.060 --> 42:23.940]  that's how open it is you can run around with ISIS flags on the border nothing
[42:23.940 --> 42:32.500]  happens in America but let me tell you folks they listen to everything I do
[42:32.500 --> 42:36.740]  they track everything I do and they can plant anything they wanted on me at any
[42:36.740 --> 42:39.900]  time and you too and that's how they control Congress by the way and that's
[42:39.900 --> 42:44.380]  how they control the Pentagon I saw an article a few years ago where they came
[42:44.380 --> 42:47.700]  into work one day at the Pentagon and over 10,000 computers had child porn on
[42:47.700 --> 42:51.100]  them and they came in everybody and said you're under investigation now better
[42:51.100 --> 43:01.700]  do what you're told you understand how this system works this is pure evil and
[43:01.700 --> 43:15.420]  it only gets worse yep 2010 so listen to this article again why there's these
[43:15.420 --> 43:18.380]  cell towers popping up and the telecoms don't own them and no one knows what
[43:18.380 --> 43:23.180]  they are well find out whose property it's on call the landowner then they can
[43:23.180 --> 43:27.740]  call the police and they can jack into it with their forensics people there and
[43:27.740 --> 43:32.020]  tell you exactly who's it is they're not folks because it's homeland security or
[43:32.020 --> 43:37.460]  it's the CIA or defense intelligence or a private group they're just it could be
[43:37.460 --> 43:42.500]  hackers or somebody else and they're on the news going here's the fake tower we
[43:42.500 --> 43:47.660]  don't know who has it and let's talk to the former FBI agent oh it's not the
[43:47.660 --> 43:57.660]  government oh she BS to security analysts rose rise a former FBI agent said
[43:57.660 --> 44:03.340]  it's likely being used illegally I doubt that they are installed by law
[44:03.340 --> 44:07.740]  enforcement as they require a warrant to intercept conversations or data and
[44:07.740 --> 44:11.940]  since the cell providers are ordered by the court to cooperate with the
[44:11.940 --> 44:16.100]  intercept they really wouldn't need that no they don't want to pay the
[44:16.100 --> 44:21.300]  telecoms anymore for the data they want their own systems that they also then
[44:21.300 --> 44:25.540]  use as the government's own cell communication that they think is
[44:25.540 --> 44:29.620]  secure for them and encrypted but then that also doubles as stealing and
[44:29.620 --> 44:34.540]  grabbing all of your data do you got what I'm saying now do you understand what
[44:34.540 --> 44:41.180]  I'm saying now everything they do has been war-gamed brain bugged looked at
[44:41.180 --> 44:48.660]  actuary studied to have multi-platform uses but at the bottom of the rabbit
[44:48.660 --> 44:52.740]  hole they want to know what everybody's doing to dump it into algorithms to know
[44:52.740 --> 44:57.300]  the future development of desires where populations are going what's going to be
[44:57.300 --> 45:02.380]  the next hot thing in the market so they can steal your dreams steal your
[45:02.380 --> 45:07.340]  patents steal your ideas and control and model the future and when you're able
[45:07.340 --> 45:11.260]  to know people's dreams you're then able to influence the dreams and add
[45:11.260 --> 45:17.780]  stimuli to control the herd instinct and literally enslave the mind the group
[45:17.780 --> 45:24.700]  consciousness the archetype of humanity and destroy free will you're able to
[45:24.700 --> 45:29.380]  rig the stock market you're able to control the whole system you're able to
[45:29.380 --> 45:36.740]  game every single facet of it with this technology they could literally empower
[45:36.740 --> 45:42.940]  humanity and turn humanity loose and we within a decade would already be space
[45:42.940 --> 45:47.820]  bases you name it they're suppressing technology it would be a renaissance but
[45:47.820 --> 45:51.020]  they're not going to allow that in fact they may already have allowed it for
[45:51.020 --> 45:56.380]  themselves and be way more advanced than we even know because the open
[45:56.380 --> 45:59.980]  discussions are about how we're vestigial and how the elite have already
[45:59.980 --> 46:05.140]  moved on to the next level and should they just exterminate us build joys
[46:05.140 --> 46:08.100]  why the future doesn't need us
[46:09.260 --> 46:15.620]  we've got all the former top NSA people like William Benny and others saying no
[46:15.620 --> 46:23.220]  they're blackmailing everyone the plan is quote total totalitarianism and he is
[46:23.220 --> 46:29.820]  on the broadcast tomorrow I'm told this is the end of freedom this is the end of
[46:29.820 --> 46:33.620]  free will this is the end of having your own mind and you look at this elite they
[46:33.620 --> 46:38.460]  wage war on families they wage war on logic they wage war on prosperity they
[46:38.460 --> 46:43.140]  wage war on health they wage war on honor they wage war on good you understand
[46:43.140 --> 46:52.040]  it's bad people running this they built it to control us and dominate us as an
[46:52.040 --> 46:58.100]  act of pure power we are all being given the Trojan horse technology we're all
[46:58.100 --> 47:04.780]  being given sub rings of power to use the Lord of the Rings analogy but
[47:04.780 --> 47:08.740]  everyone who's been given all these little rings when the police department
[47:08.740 --> 47:12.860]  and the CIA and the FBI and all of you that are being told you're doing this
[47:12.860 --> 47:16.980]  for good and being told you're doing this to stop bad people and being told
[47:16.980 --> 47:21.900]  that this is part of a greater good plan you don't know that in the darkness one
[47:21.900 --> 47:28.060]  ring was forged out of malice and hate to dominate and to bring total darkness
[47:28.060 --> 47:34.900]  to the world one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring
[47:34.900 --> 47:43.260]  them into the darkness and bind them the archetypal allegory of the tyranny of
[47:43.260 --> 47:48.420]  the New World Order which we now learn as all great linguists and archetypal
[47:48.420 --> 47:53.700]  researchers professor J. R. R. Tolkien was aware of the New World Order and the
[47:53.700 --> 48:00.140]  master plan and he said that the system is run by dark wizards that seek to
[48:00.140 --> 48:08.860]  control the consciousness and souls of humanity and they are trying to build a
[48:08.860 --> 48:18.460]  ring to find them to bring them and to bind them when we start the next hour I
[48:18.460 --> 48:21.720]  will play the six minute report that is one of the most powerful ever by John
[48:21.720 --> 48:27.420]  Bowne. In fact John Bowne has been producing and board-opping and helping
[48:27.420 --> 48:31.060]  coordinate reporters he's done a great job all over the map but he's so good at
[48:31.060 --> 48:36.700]  reports that I'm 50-50 now I've got him just doing reports because that's
[48:36.700 --> 48:40.200]  really his true talent he'll also be doing some directing and coming up with
[48:40.200 --> 48:44.400]  programs and things that we're going to be investigating and other things but
[48:44.400 --> 48:53.780]  we've got John Bowne's report that's now up on infowars.com coming up dealing
[48:53.780 --> 49:00.860]  with the fact that there is basically an imminent American Chernobyl or imminent
[49:00.860 --> 49:07.860]  American Fukushima with these nuclear power plants that are built on the
[49:07.860 --> 49:15.260]  fault lines and I'm gonna tweet that video out as well at real Alex Jones and
[49:15.260 --> 49:20.540]  I'm gonna get it posted to our Facebook in fact guys I had the print off of the
[49:20.540 --> 49:25.140]  video earlier with the actual title of it can I have that again and I don't see
[49:25.140 --> 49:29.540]  that here or see that in my list so I want to be able to announce the name of
[49:29.540 --> 49:35.620]  that so people know how to find that when I give it to the guys thank you but it
[49:35.620 --> 49:42.100]  is so frustrating to have the system talk to us like children and have the FBI
[49:42.100 --> 49:46.740]  go oh we don't know what these towers are popping up ladies and gentlemen it
[49:46.740 --> 49:53.380]  came out three years after we first broke it and Drudge carried our story we
[49:53.380 --> 49:57.180]  just went to the federal purchase orders and the federal grant that they put up
[49:57.180 --> 50:03.860]  thousands more microphones in Chicago in the street lamps and then earlier this
[50:03.860 --> 50:08.820]  year they announced on local TV news that yes there are new sculptures in town
[50:08.820 --> 50:13.860]  that have terrorism and crisis monitoring equipment that happens to have
[50:13.860 --> 50:17.980]  audio so they didn't say we're listening to you they said oh we have something to
[50:17.980 --> 50:22.300]  detect terrorists and that helps people during crises it's a it's a it's it's
[50:22.300 --> 50:28.940]  audio it records oh it's audio okay okay great it'd be like going to somebody's
[50:28.940 --> 50:31.900]  door and saying you mind if I come in put a microphone in your house just to
[50:31.900 --> 50:35.340]  listen to you they would say get off my porch for a punch in the nose but see
[50:35.340 --> 50:39.700]  your cable boxes your computers they're all already listening to you patented

[54:27.340 --> 54:31.940]  hour then FDA whistleblowers expose that they know it's causing autism the
[54:31.940 --> 54:36.300]  vaccines John Rappaport joins us and then we've got reporters on the border
[54:36.300 --> 54:39.740]  where the federal government says a terror attack is imminent they believe
[54:39.740 --> 54:45.700]  will happen I'm gonna break down the rest of the story on that front but again
[54:45.700 --> 54:52.020]  there is ubiquitous spy grids built into the cell phones the computers it I was
[54:52.020 --> 54:56.260]  told over a decade ago that the chips could be energized from a distance by a
[54:56.260 --> 55:00.700]  top engineer and that they could even if your computer wasn't hooked to the
[55:00.700 --> 55:05.580]  internet they could wirelessly steal the data and all this built-in tech you've
[55:05.580 --> 55:10.300]  got to pay for it it messes up how your machines function we've had Dr. Stallman
[55:10.300 --> 55:17.300]  the inventor of open source on the show he's talked about this why so much of
[55:17.300 --> 55:22.220]  our tech doesn't work right is because what we're using it for is secondary you
[55:22.220 --> 55:27.180]  pay for a computer you pay for a cell phone you pay for a car and there might
[55:27.180 --> 55:32.500]  be $5,000 I was reading in an article of government mandated illegal spy
[55:32.500 --> 55:40.220]  garbage $5,000 of it most new cars have two or three spy hubs in them wired in
[55:40.220 --> 55:45.540]  where the car won't work if it breaks there's gonna be a huge market and
[55:45.540 --> 55:48.740]  removing this stuff like if I wanted to just make money I'd start a nationwide
[55:48.740 --> 55:52.460]  movement to remove the spy tech just like I told you before it was
[55:52.460 --> 55:56.780]  declassified that on-star listens to you in real time without warrants then it
[55:56.780 --> 56:01.700]  came out in the news and they don't want you knowing that just like it turned out
[56:01.700 --> 56:08.660]  the DEA for over a decade has access to NSA live phone records live time in
[56:08.660 --> 56:14.500]  their database and then when they go to court to a grand jury or go to get an
[56:14.500 --> 56:18.980]  indictment they build a fake case with fake evidence how they know you are a
[56:18.980 --> 56:24.100]  drug dealer or a money launder and they go and lie and perjure themselves and
[56:24.100 --> 56:31.340]  it's ubiquitous in secret hand signals to the judges nationwide and those same
[56:31.340 --> 56:34.500]  corrupt judges will put you in jail for not quote paying your income tax the
[56:34.500 --> 56:39.060]  federal reserve see how it's all a big little secret society little secret
[56:39.060 --> 56:44.140]  agent thing and of course they don't shut down the real drug dealers they
[56:44.140 --> 56:47.220]  don't shut down the real child traffickers they don't shut down the real
[56:47.220 --> 56:52.380]  child porn people they're doing snuff films no they plant it on innocent
[56:52.380 --> 56:58.500]  people's computers and then send them to prison now there are good sectors of
[56:58.500 --> 57:01.820]  the government that are battling the other sector but it's it's just so far
[57:01.820 --> 57:07.020]  gone ladies and gentlemen so we've got a report coming out where we'll document
[57:07.020 --> 57:12.980]  the mystery of the cell towers is solved we just solved it right here the
[57:12.980 --> 57:17.540]  phantom rogue cell towers are not phantom or not rogue it's like black
[57:17.540 --> 57:21.100]  helicopters they were hitting towns all over the country blowing stuff up
[57:21.100 --> 57:25.580]  scaring everybody as a scyop reporters would cover it and national news would
[57:25.580 --> 57:30.900]  go crazy people in st. Louis claim helicopters blew up the old bakery and
[57:30.900 --> 57:35.300]  then there'd be local news footage of it happening and for a decade they would
[57:35.300 --> 57:39.020]  just say it didn't exist I would go get footage of it interview police chiefs
[57:39.020 --> 57:43.380]  and they would have a peek I'm out and say Alex Jones is delusional and believe
[57:43.380 --> 57:48.060]  he saw black helicopters Alex Jones believes their secret cell towers Alex
[57:48.060 --> 57:52.260]  Jones six floor I'd hurt shit oh my gosh he doesn't trust an own criminal
[57:52.260 --> 57:59.620]  organization he's a bad guy meanwhile jihadis have taken over Libya they're
[57:59.620 --> 58:04.260]  murdering everybody in masks just Christians blacks non-radical Muslims

[58:10.700 --> 58:15.500]  getting no heat for overthrowing Gaddafi and doing this no heat for 11
[58:15.500 --> 58:21.700]  missing airliners in Tripoli no heat for any of it and there'll be no heat when
[58:21.700 --> 58:27.860]  ISIS blows up Fort Bliss with a dump truck full of TNT they'll be that I
[58:27.860 --> 58:33.620]  predict MSNBC will somehow blame me they'll be nothing nothing they'll blame
[58:33.620 --> 58:38.060]  they'll blame George Washington like they do at Fort Hood saying he's anybody
[58:38.060 --> 58:44.180]  good as scum scum is gone scum rules America scum gets a red carpet
[58:44.180 --> 58:50.860]  screwed over at police checkpoints and taser I began to get into iodine a few
[58:50.860 --> 58:54.260]  years ago because it was helping me and my family so much get healthy and
[58:54.260 --> 58:59.540]  detoxified most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the
[58:59.540 --> 59:04.340]  world iodine is key to so many of the body's functions especially the
[59:04.340 --> 59:08.780]  thyroid I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group you now know it
[59:08.780 --> 59:13.780]  as survival shield true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb then
[59:13.780 --> 59:17.460]  about a year ago he said listen if you think this is powerful I'm going to come
[59:17.460 --> 59:22.780]  out with rare earth deep earth crystals and the results that I personally have
[59:22.780 --> 59:28.620]  had have been life-changing nobody else has got iodine based on these pure

[01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:29.220]  we're back in the hour number two
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:35.820]  we've got John Robbaport joining us coming up 20 minutes we've got a very
[01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:41.300]  important investigative report we're gonna premiere here dealing with the
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:44.980]  oblo canyon nuclear power plant it's very important that's coming up the next
[01:00:44.980 --> 01:00:47.220]  segment
[01:00:49.860 --> 01:00:55.180]  there's articles here where Rand Paul is being criticized as an isolationist by
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:01:01.780]  Republicans and Democrats because he was against the Syria war they're trying
[01:01:01.780 --> 01:01:06.660]  to spin it I heard him do it this morning on the radio let's see he doesn't want to
[01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:12.900]  go after Al Qaeda he was against arming Al Qaeda to attack Syria and he's coming
[01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:17.340]  out saying he's not an isolationist Rand Paul not an isolationist if I had been
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:21.340]  in President Obama's shoes I would have acted more decisively and strongly against
[01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:26.500]  ISIS some pundits are surprised that I support destroying the Islamic State in
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:32.380]  Iraq and greater Syria militarily I said I support it I do but I support a real
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:37.820]  attack on these people and he's responding to that because they've been
[01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.500]  trying to say oh you're not for attacking them I mean that's that's the
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:45.220]  Obama spin has been we see we need to be there because they were there no you
[01:01:45.220 --> 01:01:52.100]  armed them they shouldn't be I've said that since I began public life then I am
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.820]  not an isolationist nor an interventionist I look at the world to
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:59.700]  consider war realistically and constitutionally I see war as the last
[01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:03.260]  resort but I agree with Reagan's idea that no country should mistake US
[01:02:03.260 --> 01:02:07.620]  reluctance for war for lack of resolve as commander-in-chief I would not allow
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:12.060]  our enemies to kill our citizens or our ambassadors peace through strength only
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:17.580]  works if you have a show of strength he goes on to point out and we have it
[01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:22.700]  quoted on info wars comm Steve Watson's article Rand Paul Obama support weapons
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:29.020]  has allowed ISIS to grow we've we quote have done a disservice and created
[01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:33.700]  chaos that has allowed the jihadists to grow stronger that's right that's why I
[01:02:33.700 --> 01:02:38.100]  said a month ago yeah I'm all for bombing ISIS but I said three months ago
[01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:41.500]  when they were invading Iraq in huge columns that's when they could have all
[01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:45.540]  been taken out but they don't want that they want to just bomb them when they
[01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:49.020]  know you gotta paint by the numbers you're not supposed to go into Kurdistan
[01:02:49.020 --> 01:02:53.100]  you're not supposed to go into the East controlled by Iran we're breaking Iraq
[01:02:53.100 --> 01:02:57.260]  up in three pieces you can murder all the Christians and non radical Muslims
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:04.820]  over here in the West this is your new IS state now you behave yourselves and now
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:10.540]  they're running around taking over almost all of Libya which was the plan it
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:14.660]  was jihadis they used out of Saudi Arabia brought into Benghazi to do this
[01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:18.500]  three years ago and this is what I've been telling you this was coming that
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.620]  they would say oh we're gonna get an airliner shot down oh they're gonna blow
[01:03:21.620 --> 01:03:26.980]  up Europe all the attacks imminent when they set them up and open the gate we're
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:31.660]  gonna cover this next hour with Joe Bix and I'm telling you we don't have the
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:35.300]  staff or the crew of the energy to do it we have millions of listeners millions
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:39.580]  of viewers on YouTube alone every week folks there's hundreds of videos of me
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:42.500]  when the whole Libya thing was happening predicting what would happen
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:46.700]  days after Benghazi saying they gave him stinger missiles it was all set up to
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:52.140]  kill the ambassador to plausible deniability arming al-Qaeda and al
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:56.980]  Nazra and then saying what would happen next the reason it's important is that
[01:03:56.980 --> 01:04:00.460]  we need to be able to show people where I predicted and broke down the entire
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:04.860]  chain of events exactly as it transpired not because I had a crystal ball but
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:09.780]  because I know the globalist program I know how they operate I know how they
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:16.740]  do it and they will use the coming ISIS attacks that are undoubted going to
[01:04:16.740 --> 01:04:21.700]  happen in Europe and the United States they're going to use these attacks to
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:24.940]  take our liberties whether it's a real ISIS team that does it or whether they
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:28.860]  use contractors to do it or whether that's a foreign agency that does it I
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:33.380]  don't know who will do it but they will do it and then you've got all the weird
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:37.380]  Fort Bragg training and army war college stuff about the tea parties gonna
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:41.260]  link up with radical Muslims remember that and you're like but that doesn't
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:44.580]  make any sense the tea parties Islamophobic they don't care they're
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:48.020]  training for that they're gonna blow it's a good they're gonna blow stuff up
[01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:52.260]  and claim the liberty movement is involved member MSNBC claiming I
[01:04:52.260 --> 01:04:58.700]  influenced the Boston bombers that's the narrative they're already getting ready
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:03.900]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is
[01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.460]  becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air
[01:05:07.460 --> 01:05:11.500]  outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:15.300]  concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend
[01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:19.540]  90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are

[01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:26.380]  38% approval rating lowest of his presidency Rand Paul came out and said
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:31.300]  that Obama has created a jihadist wonderland in an op-ed piece in Time
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:37.060]  Magazine accusing Obama of helping create ISIS absolutely that's why I like
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:42.660]  Rand Paul never supported any military action until now he says yeah let's bomb
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:47.140]  ISIS Obama isn't really bombing ISIS they're bombing a few trucks here and
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:51.180]  there because it's so embarrassing that they've been caught they thought we were
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:55.940]  so stupid that they would use them in Syria and Libya and against Russia and
[01:09:55.940 --> 01:10:07.220]  against Egypt and that the world wouldn't wake up to it this is a big deal it
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:14.820]  has of course been exposed that our southern border has been ordered wide
[01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:20.380]  open by Obama so they better think twice about letting ISIS in or staging
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:24.700]  something because we're gonna make sure this government is criminally held
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:29.580]  responsible for letting ISIS attack this country
[01:10:31.220 --> 01:10:37.540]  ISIS is a real jihadi organization with over a hundred thousand members they
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:42.500]  are growing into India into Africa they are attacking sites all over the world
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:46.940]  they have attacked the US Embassy in Tripoli they have overrun it they have
[01:10:46.940 --> 01:10:50.940]  taken over the airport they are running around murdering Christians everywhere
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:54.860]  they find them they're racist they find black people they chop their heads off
[01:10:54.860 --> 01:11:01.180]  over 10,000 blacks have been murdered since the liberation of Libya by NATO to
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:06.740]  wreck that country and burn it to the ground what a war crime when Gaddafi
[01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:11.620]  that apologized paid reparations invested tens of billions of dollars
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:15.980]  with the West he was set up and overthrown to destabilize that region a
[01:11:15.980 --> 01:11:24.220]  war crime far from keeping the peace and NATO is a threat to it the London
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:30.980]  Guardian reports and I agree it is just a mad dog immoral position of the elites
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:33.540]  that we see
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:42.980]  I want to get into the latest on the border where Obama administration is
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:48.260]  refusing to tell Congress where illegal children went this has been going on for
[01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:52.860]  three months now the border has been ordered open for nine months almost nine
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:59.660]  months since the beginning of this year eight months in change and it's all on
[01:11:59.660 --> 01:12:04.980]  record look at how controlled the press is no one knew that they were pulling
[01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:08.980]  buses in to the border and loading them on greyhounds with border patrol
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:13.540]  assisting them with Democratic Party officials giving them vouchers federal
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:17.220]  vouchers to go anywhere they wanted without even a background checker ID
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:24.700]  allowed on airplanes without IDs you know who broke that in foe wars.com and
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:30.940]  I'm not telling you that to brag I'm saying look how controlled CNN is Fox
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:34.500]  News wouldn't even report that till we broke it and the New York Times three
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:43.420]  weeks later reported it and who told us ICE and the border patrol we should have
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:49.940]  enough reporters to be on the border all the time we don't our reporters are down
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:56.220]  there now joining us next hour but please financially support us please by

[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:43.940]  out of control they are that they don't care of reactors are built on fault lines
[01:13:43.940 --> 01:13:47.700]  are leaking it's it's a death wish it's an evil spirit I don't know what you
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:53.060]  call it here's John Bounds report the coming American Chernobyl at Devil's
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:59.580]  Canyon California. On the 26th of April 1986 the worst nuclear power plant
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:04.020]  disaster in history occurred at the Chernobyl plant in the Ukraine. Chernobyl
[01:14:04.020 --> 01:14:08.460]  was labeled as a level 7 the maximum classification on the international
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:13.340]  nuclear event scale. At the core of the blown-out reactor and buried under 14
[01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:17.220]  meters of rubble the graphite surrounding the nuclear fuel burns and
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:21.060]  melts the uranium the radioactive fallout is going to be a hundred times
[01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:25.380]  greater than the combined power of the two atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:36.660]  Nagasaki years later on the 11th of March 2011 the Fukushima meltdown reawakened
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:40.500]  public awareness regarding the ever-present dangers of nuclear power
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:48.580]  about 270 276 so we're maxing out round 280 or so and remember 30 is what's
[01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:54.020]  normal for this location now they're disputing that this isn't the CCM 137
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:57.140]  they're saying this is radium and other things that naturally occur in the
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:01.260]  environment whatever it is is abnormally high with the recent earthquake
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:06.260]  activities stirring the ring of fire the Diablo Canyon power plant located near
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:12.380]  Avila Beach in San Luis Obisbo resting near not one but four fault lines is a
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:16.460]  clear and present danger the second fault known as the
[01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:20.620]  husbandry fault was only discovered after the plant's completion in November
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:27.260]  of 1927 the husbandry fault generated a 7.1 magnitude earthquake 10 miles
[01:15:27.260 --> 01:15:32.900]  offshore a 2013 document filed by former nuclear regulatory Commission
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:37.620]  inspector Michael Peck insisted on closing down Diablo until the Commission
[01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:42.180]  determined whether the plant's equipment could survive higher seismic stress
[01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:47.940]  levels in 1981 Diablo was incorrectly retrofitted when employees failed to
[01:15:47.940 --> 01:15:52.860]  reverse the plans for the twin reactors regardless the Nuclear Regulation
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:57.340]  Commission approved the safety of Diablo's monstrosity of incompetence
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:02.100]  Diablo has a seismic monitoring and safety system ready to shut it down
[01:16:02.100 --> 01:16:06.340]  immediately in the event of significant ground motion the motion is detected by
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:10.300]  sensors in the ground and provides three-dimensional data on seismic
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:14.660]  conditions but that won't stop the potential damage unleashed by the fuel
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:19.100]  rods as witnessed during the Fukushima debacle of course Pacific gas and
[01:16:19.100 --> 01:16:22.420]  electric would like you to believe this ticking time bomb is good for jobs
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:27.300]  energy consumption of its 2 million recipients and the way forward as old
[01:16:27.300 --> 01:16:31.380]  man Cole is aggressively shut down so if somebody wants to build a coal-powered
[01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:36.060]  plant they can it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're gonna be
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:40.980]  charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted but
[01:16:40.980 --> 01:16:44.940]  the voices opposed are many after president Richard Nixon called for
[01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:50.980]  construction of 1,000 nuclear plants by the year 2000 1900 anti nuclear
[01:16:50.980 --> 01:16:57.100]  movement protesters were arrested in 1981 during a 10-day civil disobedience
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:17:02.220]  blockade of the Diablo Canyon power plant with the main gate cleared and the
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:07.140]  last blockade are in jail pacific gas and electric made final preparations to
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:10.020]  start the reactor
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:19.020]  but then at the last moment PG&E publicly admitted a grave mistake there
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:23.980]  are two reactors at Diablo mirror images of each other the blueprints for
[01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:28.260]  units one and two had gotten mixed up and the earthquake supports for the
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:33.260]  cooling pipes the same cooling system designed to prevent a meltdown had been
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:40.220]  installed backwards it was the first of hundreds of mistakes discovered later
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:44.700]  all made on the two and a half billion dollar structure described by the
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:48.660]  Nuclear Regulatory Commission as the most highly analyzed building in the
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:53.940]  world today most locals and tourists are completely unaware of the passion
[01:17:53.940 --> 01:18:00.060]  Californians vented against the nuclear energy mafia just 33 years ago
[01:18:00.060 --> 01:18:05.060]  Fukushima resting right over those mountains I don't know what you're
[01:18:05.060 --> 01:18:09.980]  talking about experts would have us just bury our heads in the sand but some are
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:15.660]  already preparing for the inevitability of America's Fukushima if Diablo blows
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:21.620]  nobody's staying around to use I've actually got backpacks in my car you
[01:18:21.620 --> 01:18:27.060]  know for heading out preparedness I think is very important yeah but the
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:30.140]  whole idea that they're gonna sound the sirens and we're all gonna head north
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:36.940]  it just won't work yeah northeast so I wish it wasn't there but it is and maybe
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:41.380]  they'll deactivate it and that would be fine with me yeah absolutely I think
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:46.300]  it's great how the citizens on our own can be prepared yet you know we're
[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:50.140]  asking our government basically to take care of us and they're you know telling
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:54.900]  us to look the other way and how can you do that when all of this is at risk well
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:58.780]  it always comes in the limelight once there's an earthquake so the snap at
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:02.300]  earthquake has made everybody kind of think about it again you know that a
[01:19:02.300 --> 01:19:06.580]  good earthquake would cause the plant to blow and I would want to get out of
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:10.100]  here when you look around and you see all this beauty all these families all
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:14.620]  these people how does that make you feel knowing that they're okay with a
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:18.980]  potential Fukushima situation here in America we know we know we couldn't all
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:25.300]  get out you know they say head north I mean act yeah head east northeast once
[01:19:25.300 --> 01:19:30.260]  the plant warns us but you know that you couldn't do that the freeway would be
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:34.700]  jammed that's why you know we know we could go across the Santa Maria River
[01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:40.260]  bed and head south I raised seven children in this town and I taught them
[01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:43.620]  all to run home no matter what the school told them because we were gonna
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:47.500]  hop in the car and get out somehow they weren't gonna wait for school buses but
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:52.900]  yeah it's a big problem they say we provide 20% of California's power with
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:57.460]  that plant but I think they named it Diablo for a reason as the purported
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:02.820]  Chinese curse goes may you live in interesting times for info wars.com
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:09.060]  I'm John Bowne and that is the report that we just premiered here on the
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:13.060]  radio that's type of reports we have every night seven o'clock central info
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:17.620]  wars nightly news we just skip this network break I do that routinely because
[01:20:17.620 --> 01:20:20.980]  it just doesn't feel right even go to break when we're covering subjects this
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:25.940]  this hardcore and the final addendum I would add when we've had physicists and
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:32.860]  other experts on nuclear physicists and of course seismologists and geologists
[01:20:32.860 --> 01:20:37.700]  is that the entire ring of fire has been very active the last decade in the
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:45.140]  Pacific and the only area that hasn't had a major earthquake 8.0 or higher is
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:54.020]  the piece of the ring of fire through California and so it's set to go and they
[01:20:54.020 --> 01:21:03.180]  built Fukushima on a fault line and you saw what happened with that five of the
[01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:09.860]  six reactors melted down two of them blew completely up and I was brought up
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:19.980]  total free market anti-communist and so they would attach you know like oh not
[01:21:19.980 --> 01:21:25.180]  liking GMO or not liking you know radiation to being a commie so I was
[01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:28.460]  like nuclear power is great it's safe it's wonderful well the truth is it isn't
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:35.540]  they hide the problems it's done wrong I'm all for technology but just because
[01:21:35.540 --> 01:21:39.820]  some of the left historically is against something doesn't mean then they
[01:21:39.820 --> 01:21:45.100]  weren't right now now the left today says they love nuclear power and they
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:52.460]  love GMO and they love me look at Obama so I don't just go off left wing or
[01:21:52.460 --> 01:21:56.580]  right wing I go off real research real issues and they've got a nuclear
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:02.780]  regulatory Commission UN report our own nuclear Commission's report 91% of the
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:07.660]  400 and whatever it is reactors 427 or whatever it is that are that are energy
[01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:10.940]  producing and they've got hundreds of other research reactors like the one at
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:15.100]  the JJ Pickle Center in north Austin it's a big one for a research reactor so
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:20.020]  it's actually thousands if you count those 91% are leaking and at that very
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:25.060]  Diablo plant a few years ago it was on NBC news they kept having leaks so they
[01:22:25.060 --> 01:22:28.780]  were supposed to turn the alarms on when there's a leak and the headline was
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:33.380]  well we decided releasing some radiation safe we don't want to scare people
[01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:37.300]  we're gonna stop turning the alarms on so I mean there could be an earthquake
[01:22:37.300 --> 01:22:43.180]  the whole thing blows up they're not gonna turn those alarms on I mean used
[01:22:43.180 --> 01:22:47.140]  to government wasn't perfect but it would try to not blow things up it would
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:51.460]  try to not have nuclear war it would try to not start war with the Russians our
[01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:55.340]  government didn't openly fund al-qaeda to run around chopping Christians heads
[01:22:55.340 --> 01:23:01.300]  off even back when Reagan you know was running him up against the Russians now
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:06.980]  it's just so much more immoral and there's another one possible leak causes
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:16.220]  sand sand on a free nuclear plant shut down that's another one out man that's
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:24.580]  Diablo Canyon the others the Ablo Canyon plant in St. Louis Obispo County and
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.580]  then it goes through that was a precautionary shutdown and then they
[01:23:27.580 --> 01:23:30.780]  went on to say but we're gonna stop issuing the alerts now we don't want
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:39.340]  to scare you and again it's this attitude to just absolutely ignore
[01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:53.540]  everything do we have our guests okay John Rappaport is an investigative
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:24:00.140]  journalist with more no more fake news.com and he's joining us because I
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:05.620]  got a call about two weeks ago from Dr. Wakefield who the media has tried to
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:09.220]  discredit and attack the British doctor that now lives in Austin Texas and he
[01:24:09.220 --> 01:24:13.780]  said we're gonna be breaking with a major government whistleblower in the
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:19.100]  next week the fact that they knew that vaccines were linked to autism and that
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:23.580]  reminded me of the 2000 meeting at the CDC they got reported four years later
[01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:28.540]  by ABC News where the head of the CDC in a big roundtable conference concluded
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:32.140]  and admitted yes if the public ever finds out about this you can read the
[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:36.140]  quotes we're all going to jail we got to cover this up but don't give it to your
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:40.620]  kids I'm gonna tell my daughter don't give it to my grandkids and we ought to
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:44.500]  pull those articles back up to a report on that as a flashback but but this has
[01:24:44.500 --> 01:24:50.220]  come out before that they know we've gone from autism one in 30,000 to one in
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:55.500]  68 a few years ago now they're saying one in 56 the point is it's epidemic
[01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:59.580]  when they say oh it's over diagnosis whatever no it's not and sure it's
[01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:03.860]  pesticides it's chemicals it's a cocktail but it's the vaccines in babies
[01:25:03.860 --> 01:25:09.820]  pushing it over the edge and I've had medical doctors on you name it they're
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:15.100]  seeing in autism right now one in 68 US children and that's CNN going with an
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:19.380]  old number this year it's actually one in 50 something the doctors I've talked
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:23.180]  to it's set to be in some countries they're even worse than us that give
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:28.620]  vaccines one in 20 something I think that's South Korea I go to restaurants I
[01:25:28.620 --> 01:25:31.420]  go to movie theaters take my kids the movies they'll be like a third of the
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:38.020]  kids in there don't know who they are and are obviously autistic I mean I go to
[01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:41.700]  you know go to a resort with my kids a hotel at the beach and you go out of the
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:46.820]  pool I was like 30 kids and 10 of them can't talk I mean we're getting hit
[01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:52.460]  hard and what's gonna happen when half the kids can't talk now it's eugenics
[01:25:52.460 --> 01:25:55.980]  this is the same government that shot black people up with cephalus and I use
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:59.260]  that example because everybody knows about Tuskegee people don't know about
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:03.540]  the three or four thousand others you classified nerve-gassing troops killing
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:10.260]  foster children radiating children killing appellations is adding poison to
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:14.900]  water spraying people in the New York subway with bio weapons and 68 having
[01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:21.260]  military doctors there when they were dying to take blood samples this is
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:27.100]  what we know about project shed atomic soldiers 36,000 Nazis brought here an
[01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:33.100]  operation paperclip my grandfather worked for oil companies in west Texas and
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:37.700]  New Mexico and told me that there were people that almost got in fist fights
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:41.180]  there's only place to eat would be military bases that had restaurants and
[01:26:41.180 --> 01:26:46.100]  that you'd go there and there'd be more Germans at military bases in the 50s out
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:53.020]  in the in the west then they're you know had more regular troops I remember
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:56.940]  looking at my grandmother going Nazis at military bases and GIs wanting to
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:01.540]  kick their butts because they would smart off to people
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:06.220]  anybody that watches documentaries about you know Werner von Braun you name it
[01:27:06.220 --> 01:27:10.100]  even when he turned himself in he was so arrogant to the GIs to the generals
[01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:15.300]  saying I'm smarter to you and all this stuff and I mean this is who and again
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:19.140]  it's not that we're Nazi run it's that the Nazis were coming home our
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:24.420]  government and the British government put Hitler in and loved all that stuff
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:31.780]  until they double-crossed him and so a government run by 36,000 Nazis NASA the
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:37.660]  CDC everything the CIA you name it do you trust them to take their vaccines and
[01:27:37.660 --> 01:27:43.660]  the answer is absolutely not now it's just more sophisticated we're going to
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:47.380]  break in a few minutes John but tell folks because we've been running your
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:52.780]  articles every day and info wars calm you've been on this of a major whistle
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:57.260]  blower being retaliated against more people coming forward with the cover up
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:28:02.260]  of the vaccines give us a snapshot of what's coming up the next segment
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:10.420]  William Thompson he's the whistleblower at the CDC major scientists 2004 he and
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:15.260]  his co-authors buried data that would have showed a much higher rate of
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:20.340]  autism in children who were vaccinated with the MMR vaccine measles mumps
[01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:25.700]  rubella he admits this amount of public statement as of August 27 that he
[01:28:25.700 --> 01:28:30.740]  cooked the data that he and his co-authors sat on it for 10 years while
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:36.460]  more cases of autism piled up because of vaccines nobody said anything it was
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:42.300]  omitted the law of silence and he broke the law through his lawyer because he
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:49.660]  lawyered up and yet nothing is happening of any note in the major media the
[01:28:49.660 --> 01:28:53.900]  study hasn't been retracted this isn't you know if you just look at the
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:29:01.460]  scientific medical research community an admission like this is like a time bomb
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:08.300]  going off you would expect all kinds of recriminations investigations shut down
[01:29:08.300 --> 01:29:13.220]  the research programs we've got to go back and look at all the vaccine studies
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:18.100]  that we've done because they could have been faked as well nothing like this has
[01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:22.180]  happened they're just still and we're trying to break the blockade I'm gonna

[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:16.780]  decade later one of the people involved in the cover-up is gone public and is
[01:34:16.780 --> 01:34:21.460]  now being retaliated against this is an incredibly important article this is
[01:34:21.460 --> 01:34:27.820]  incredibly important whistleblower this is incredibly important information we
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:33.420]  know not just from dr. Wakefield they try to destroy but from dr. Blalock and
[01:34:33.420 --> 01:34:36.380]  countless other scientists and other government studies and secret British
[01:34:36.380 --> 01:34:41.260]  studies that were released last year that had been done 20 years ago that a
[01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:46.540]  bunch of vaccines in a baby causes an autoimmune response swelling on the
[01:34:46.540 --> 01:34:53.740]  brain and retardation and they call all the different disorders that the babies
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:35:00.940]  get autism spectrum look at this article out of my fox
[01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:06.460]  city mandates free medical marijuana for low-income residents that's what the
[01:35:06.460 --> 01:35:11.860]  Berkeley City Council is doing sounds nice and friendly no it's a way to
[01:35:11.860 --> 01:35:15.580]  suppress people that's why George Soros see just because I'm for drug
[01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:20.940]  decriminalization doesn't mean I'm for the drug culture see the difference just
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:24.020]  because I don't want to throw people in jail for smoking marijuana doesn't mean
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:27.340]  I agree with the people that smoke tons of it every day in her zombies that's
[01:35:27.340 --> 01:35:32.620]  what this is about this is THX 1138 brave new world Aldous Huxley's brother ran
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:39.340]  the UN he said his book was about a real plan he was a top British eugenicist who
[01:35:39.340 --> 01:35:46.060]  went public was a plan to socially control the public they're controlling
[01:35:46.060 --> 01:35:51.660]  us with the fluoride the GMO the culture the television the additives the
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:56.780]  chemicals all of it is pharmacia through the food and the water it's in the
[01:35:56.780 --> 01:36:02.620]  water and they're hammering babies at birth with 40 something different shots
[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:09.140]  by the time they're six months old I mean I see people are like one year old
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:12.900]  two-year-old kids now I mean a lot of them you can tell are ill and are sick
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:19.020]  are in trouble and I want to start crying because I'm watching like black
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:23.340]  people injected with syphilis for 47 years secretly I'm watching people being
[01:36:23.340 --> 01:36:30.660]  murdered slowly and I know I'm right and they don't tell cops don't shoot your
[01:36:30.660 --> 01:36:35.060]  kids up they don't tell FBI agents don't shoot your kids up so you all think
[01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:38.700]  you're part of the establishment you're not you're all being targeted I want to
[01:36:38.700 --> 01:36:42.860]  give the floor now to John Rappaport of no more fake news.com and we've been
[01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:49.860]  carrying his articles daily on this cover up since it broke a week ago and we
[01:36:49.860 --> 01:36:54.900]  need to get this out to everybody about this whistleblower recap his name what
[01:36:54.900 --> 01:36:59.500]  he said what happened how they fix the data how they know the vaccines are one
[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:03.340]  of the big things with all the other environmental toxicity to push it over
[01:37:03.340 --> 01:37:08.660]  the edge and we've got to get this out and then I want you to speak to the
[01:37:08.660 --> 01:37:12.660]  big picture do you agree with me it's prima facia that this is part of the
[01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:17.580]  soft kill eugenics slow culling before they can fully cull us they've got to
[01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:21.620]  get us ready the IQs are physically dropping the the you can look at the
[01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:26.660]  graphs the illnesses the cancers the neurological disorders all across the
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:32.180]  western world the sperm counts the fertility we are under attack John
[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:39.220]  Rappaport it's biochemical warfare that's what it is under very many
[01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:44.180]  different guys as you and I have talked about before Alex and as you've been
[01:37:44.180 --> 01:37:50.820]  talking about for a long time William Thompson cgc scientist good
[01:37:50.820 --> 01:37:59.060]  reputation long-term service is one of the co-authors of a 2004 study in the
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:05.340]  very prestigious journal called pediatrics not only that but he's got
[01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:10.180]  co-authors on the study and if you look at at least two of them Colleen Boyle
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:14.900]  and Frank DiStofano it turns out low and behold that they're also high ranking
[01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:20.140]  CDC executives they're not just research scientists and they're in charge of major
[01:38:20.140 --> 01:38:26.620]  vaccine safety programs and so forth which really means PR public relations
[01:38:26.620 --> 01:38:32.860]  lies told about how great and how safe vaccines are and yet with a conflict of
[01:38:32.860 --> 01:38:37.100]  interest they also happen to be the authors on this study along with Thompson
[01:38:37.100 --> 01:38:44.100]  so after 10 years of sitting on his secrets Thompson is so guilt ridden
[01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:49.660]  that he goes public in a statement through his lawyer Rick Morgan of
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:54.700]  Cincinnati who was a whistleblower attorney and the carefully worded
[01:38:54.700 --> 01:39:00.340]  statement admits in the first two paragraphs that yes vital data were
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:07.820]  omitted from that study in 2004 and if that data if those data had been
[01:39:07.820 --> 01:39:13.380]  included then of course the link between the MMR vaccine and autism would have
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:18.620]  been apparent but that data was taken out and what was that data it was all
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:25.860]  about African-American male babies under the age of 36 months who had been
[01:39:25.860 --> 01:39:33.940]  injected with the vaccine and who had a increased significantly increased 300%
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:40.060]  elevated risk of autism that's the data that was buried intentionally all the
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:44.860]  authors knew about it and therefore the whole CDC knew about it because two of
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:50.140]  those authors at least were big-time executives there so this was all covered
[01:39:50.140 --> 01:39:55.700]  up and now this is not somebody coming in from the outside saying I know that
[01:39:55.700 --> 01:40:00.020]  the data in this study you know was cooked and buried and destroyed this is
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:06.980]  one of the authors saying this a CDC scientist actually saying this which
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:13.820]  would be big-time major news all over the world if it were on any other
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:20.420]  subject but it's about vaccines which is the sacred holy sacrament of the medical
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:25.700]  church and therefore it must not be disturbed and so what we're seeing is a
[01:40:25.700 --> 01:40:32.380]  huge media blackout all over the world on this subject like it didn't happen
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:39.340]  never took place the whistleblower never came forward he never said we omitted
[01:40:39.340 --> 01:40:44.580]  vital data we distorted the study it was a fraud no never happened never
[01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:50.940]  happened never happened and as I alluded to before the break Alex news like
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:55.660]  this even within the medical research community where we're talking published
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:41:00.580]  studies and we're talking plagiarism and we're talking distortion and lies and
[01:41:00.580 --> 01:41:05.500]  so forth if somebody like this guy Thompson steps forward as a co-author
[01:41:05.500 --> 01:41:11.220]  on a major study and admits fraud and that the protocol of the study was
[01:41:11.220 --> 01:41:16.740]  violated that's a quote from him suddenly I mean we're talking major
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:22.180]  investigations here we're talking a huge international scandal so it was
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:27.700]  anything else but they had a secret Trojan horse program in vaccines from
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:34.980]  the beginning like Dr. Sock admitting to PBS before he died that they knew every
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:42.380]  ampule of the polio vaccine had SV 40 super deadly cancer virus that
[01:41:42.380 --> 01:41:48.100]  literally more than double cancer rates in this country and that's in their own
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:54.500]  declassified report again this has been going on forever it is so outrageous and
[01:41:54.500 --> 01:42:00.300]  now we have another insider saying they covered up what it's doing to black
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:04.020]  people because I've seen in the studies hydrofluorosalic acid for whatever
[01:42:04.020 --> 01:42:11.460]  reason in the studies we've had medical doctors on is even worse for blacks this
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:16.860]  is now a study on vaccines okay and this is the empire the vaccine exactly it's
[01:42:16.860 --> 01:42:19.860]  just funny that they want it covered up about what it's doing to blacks because
[01:42:19.860 --> 01:42:23.020]  it's hurt it's hurting everybody but for whatever reason this stuff all seems
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:29.220]  to be tailored to really screw them up absolutely absolutely and this is
[01:42:29.220 --> 01:42:33.180]  something that Thompson knows his co-authors like Colleen Boyle Frank
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:39.580]  DeStefano they all know it the whole CDC knows it the whole research world knows
[01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:44.860]  it we know it it's all over the internet I've been writing stories about this end
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:51.820]  to end for the last week and a half two weeks the world knows about it but the
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:58.460]  press the big networks the big newspapers the big wire services nothing
[01:42:58.460 --> 01:43:03.700]  occasion a little story here and there but it's a total blackout and that's
[01:43:03.700 --> 01:43:07.500]  what we have to break we have to break that blackout by the way this clip we're
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:11.780]  about to play us from 2004 when two studies one of them is the study in
[01:43:11.780 --> 01:43:16.660]  question journal a pediatric came out and actually said in this study because
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:23.260]  he's been very guarded in his lawyers release I don't want to say whitewash
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:28.060]  but it's it's a major watering down the disgusting study in question is one of
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:33.260]  two that actually said mercury is good for children's brains now for those that
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:36.820]  don't know Mercury is one of the most studied heavy metals it causes
[01:43:36.820 --> 01:43:42.020]  electrochemical explosions in the brain the brain is electrochemical highly
[01:43:42.020 --> 01:43:48.180]  chemical it's the only heavy metal that causes a chain reaction similar to what
[01:43:48.180 --> 01:43:53.700]  cyanide does in the brain it is so deadly and you can look at major university
[01:43:53.700 --> 01:43:57.220]  studies they have electron microscope videos we've shown of what just a
[01:43:57.220 --> 01:44:03.980]  micron of mercury does in pig brain or human brain you know lead or something
[01:44:03.980 --> 01:44:08.300]  else just kills the neurons it touches this just like keeps killing and just
[01:44:08.300 --> 01:44:13.780]  eats through it and just causes a chain reaction massive die-off and it's being
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:16.860]  shot directly in the blood because they argue well tuna fish has got some
[01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:21.260]  mercury yeah but it's bioheld the gut is meant to be able to pass most of that
[01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:26.220]  out it's when it's injected into the blood and of course there's other things
[01:44:26.220 --> 01:44:32.540]  as well but that's a small part of it the the the the thimerosal but this is
[01:44:32.540 --> 01:44:37.860]  from CBS news but this aired all over the country this was a local Austin
[01:44:37.860 --> 01:44:43.260]  report but this PR piece aired all over the country saying mercury is good for
[01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:47.060]  you folks this is how dumb they think you are the government's putting up
[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:51.380]  illegal cell towers is still your data we have the documents we made national
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:57.220]  news last year with it they're in CBS news today saying with the FBI we don't
[01:44:57.220 --> 01:45:01.220]  know who's putting these cell towers up it's not the government stealing your
[01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:06.100]  data now that again this is how dumb they think you are just like they're
[01:45:06.100 --> 01:45:10.020]  telling you mercury is good for babies brains here is the clip
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:14.860]  mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according to two new studies
[01:45:14.860 --> 01:45:19.020]  in the journal pediatrics there have been wise by concerns that mercury based
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:22.460]  preservatives and vaccines might impair the neurological development of
[01:45:22.460 --> 01:45:26.640]  children these new studies suggest that the offices that the preservatives may
[01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:30.580]  actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance now
[01:45:30.580 --> 01:45:36.100]  that's 2004 we taped that off CBS in Austin and we played it probably 500
[01:45:36.100 --> 01:45:40.540]  times here now again one of those two studies is now being exposed obviously
[01:45:40.540 --> 01:45:46.100]  the others are fraud too as as a total lie well folks I don't need a whistleblower
[01:45:46.100 --> 01:45:50.540]  to tell me mercury isn't good for my brain okay investigative journalist John
[01:45:50.540 --> 01:45:57.340]  Rappaport so if you think mercury is bad if you happen to eat it and fish which
[01:45:57.340 --> 01:46:01.740]  of course the government warns you about don't have mercury laced fish is it so
[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:07.100]  now imagine that it's being injected into the body of a baby whose immune
[01:46:07.100 --> 01:46:12.420]  system is far from being fully developed and whatever immunity the baby has is
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:17.540]  being bypassed because of the injection that goes directly into the body
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:23.260]  thereby spreading the mercury passes through the blood-brain barrier and
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:28.420]  goes directly into the brain and there does all the things that Alex was just
[01:46:28.420 --> 01:46:32.980]  talking about setting off a virtual electrical explosion and so now this
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:38.780]  child with a mother with a father and we're now talking about untold numbers
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:45.660]  they're saying 1 in 68 1 in 56 it's all over the place the child suddenly goes
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:54.100]  dark leaves the world was happy was playful was attentive alert there
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:47:00.460]  excited about a new life and now suddenly with this load of vaccine all of a
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:04.820]  sudden the parents look at this child and the child the baby is not there
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:13.060]  anymore not to return totally different forever cut off and now you've got these
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:20.900]  Nazis at the CDC and in research labs whether they're literal or figurative
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:26.940]  but not see minds who are saying it's not a problem don't worry about it we
[01:47:26.940 --> 01:47:32.060]  don't care and by the way mothers if you want to get compensated by the
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:37.180]  government for what you say is a vaccine injury because you can't sue the
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:42.340]  manufacturers anymore because we passed a new law making that impossible then
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:47.300]  we're going to make this a nightmare for you to go through government regulations
[01:47:47.300 --> 01:47:51.540]  and they did all premeditated in the 70s creating the vaccine damage fund with
[01:47:51.540 --> 01:47:56.140]  billions in taxpayers to make the court secret if you can even get through it to
[01:47:56.140 --> 01:47:59.740]  give you a half million bucks for your for your brain damaged child all a
[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:05.460]  premeditated program literally tens of thousands of times bigger than
[01:48:05.460 --> 01:48:09.660]  injecting black men women and children with syphilis and keeping it secret a
[01:48:09.660 --> 01:48:16.780]  premeditated program to brain damage tens of millions of children bankrupt the
[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:21.980]  medical system ruin lives literally you got a little happy kid
[01:48:21.980 --> 01:48:26.660]  Hispanic black white Asian whatever it is and it's boys because our blood brain
[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:30.340]  barrier is not as strong as girls any medical doctor to tell you why is there
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:34.500]  seven or eight times more autistic boys than girls because boys aren't as tough
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:38.180]  as girls women got to have babies any medical doctor will tell you a woman
[01:48:38.180 --> 01:48:42.620]  could take more bullet wounds anything a guy can fight better you know think
[01:48:42.620 --> 01:48:47.500]  better in a you know complex situation anything women are tough as nails folks
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:51.660]  they live longer everything though it's getting so bad now women are getting it
[01:48:51.660 --> 01:48:56.420]  baby girls are getting it now but little black boys little white boys happy
[01:48:56.420 --> 01:49:00.860]  18 months old get that third round have a convulsion and then the cops come and
[01:49:00.860 --> 01:49:05.180]  say you shook your baby that's why blood's coming out their nose but the
[01:49:05.180 --> 01:49:08.780]  good news is so many of them have the blood come out of their nose at school
[01:49:08.780 --> 01:49:14.220]  when they get the shot that they don't get to take their kid imagine how and
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:17.180]  of course the cops don't know they come and they say how blood's coming out this
[01:49:17.180 --> 01:49:21.140]  kids nose they've been must have knocked their head up against a wall no they
[01:49:21.140 --> 01:49:25.820]  didn't do that you gave them a shot so deadly that their brains bleeding and
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:31.460]  it's bleeding so much it's coming out their sinus cavity I mean my god we
[01:49:31.460 --> 01:49:35.420]  might as well line these kids up and shoot them in the head John Rappaport
[01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:40.500]  that would be more moral what the Nazis did lining kids up and blowing them away
[01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:45.260]  was evil and horrible but it was more moral than doing this to them John this
[01:49:45.260 --> 01:49:50.780]  is a lifetime of torture that's what it is it's a whole lifetime of torture and
[01:49:50.780 --> 01:49:56.900]  as the child gets older things often get worse because it's not just with
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:02.740]  drawing from the world now the child can begin to get violent and then things
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:07.060]  are dangerous around the trial and the parents are desperately trying to hang
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:11.420]  on to the child and figure out what they can do what can they do what can they do
[01:50:11.420 --> 01:50:16.500]  the government has no answer the government is actually inflicting this
[01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:22.300]  look at all these crazy inner-city kids charging police for no reason I mean and
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:25.460]  people talk about them they say yeah it's like he wasn't there I'll guarantee
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:31.660]  you most these people getting killed are are mentally retarded John it's a you

[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:26.740]  study it's across the board the MMR shot alone one of dozens tripled their
[01:54:26.740 --> 01:54:32.660]  chances of autism major whistleblower who wrote the study says it was a
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:37.580]  cover-up now that broke a week and a half ago we knew about it before it broke
[01:54:37.580 --> 01:54:42.780]  and there's a blackout on it and literally I got physically angry during
[01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:45.620]  the last segment playing that clip where they say mercury's good for your
[01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:52.180]  child's brain I'm not in my comfort zone okay I'm not in some trance putting up
[01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:59.020]  with this this is a normal response to being assaulted and them lying and
[01:54:59.020 --> 01:55:02.620]  saying it's the law to take vaccines there is no law see how the whole thing's
[01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:07.740]  immoral they're like hey we're trying to protect kids hey you brought 36,000
[01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:12.300]  Nazis back to run our medical system after World War two shut up you've been
[01:55:12.300 --> 01:55:16.020]  caught doing thousands of secret tests and killing people stop acting like
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:21.260]  we're weird for not trusting you of course there's evidence that vaccines
[01:55:21.260 --> 01:55:25.620]  could help people they want to take this up into some sort of intellectual
[01:55:25.620 --> 01:55:30.740]  stratosphere we're very polite tea sipping conversation takes place among
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:35.540]  scientists blah blah blah who then report to the press who white washes
[01:55:35.540 --> 01:55:41.780]  everything but outrage is the response that's it exactly we're not saying there
[01:55:41.780 --> 01:55:45.140]  couldn't be technology in vaccines they always phrase it like oh you don't believe
[01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:48.820]  vaccines no something's a really bad pathogen we had a trustworthy medical
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:52.700]  system it was tested or people were told it could be dangerous but it's a
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:57.140]  cost-benefit then I do it no this is a secret Trojan horse program like
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:00.700]  everything else these criminals pathologically do I know I'm ranting
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:05.820]  John this just upsets me so much that we know we have eco science written by
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:09.060]  the White House science are about how they would do it with water and
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:14.380]  vaccines we have Bertrand Russell the big eugenicists saying we're gonna use
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:19.300]  vaccines in the 20s to brain damage people and control them I mean this this
[01:56:19.300 --> 01:56:24.100]  is their plan they have murdered these children's brains they're killing
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:29.020]  people with the Gardasil shot and we're just here taking it I'm sorry go ahead
[01:56:29.020 --> 01:56:33.380]  no that's absolutely right that's what's happening that's exactly what's
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:38.180]  happening and people are hypnotized and brainwashed into it and they think they
[01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:43.340]  can't do anything about it but they can't there are exemptions you can refuse
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:49.300]  the vaccines there are ways to do this in every single state they tell you there
[01:56:49.300 --> 01:56:53.140]  are not but they're all because they're lying murderers and I want to go further
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:56.940]  how do we go all the way around this in circumnavigated and start arresting the
[01:56:56.940 --> 01:57:00.620]  people involved start going after the because we've got a frame it and what
[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:05.860]  it is it's more secret government testing discovered in vaccine program and
[01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:10.500]  and they call testing the murder and maiming of the population that's right
[01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:13.900]  just like they got caught in the hepatitis shots putting HIV in it in the
[01:57:13.900 --> 01:57:18.540]  70s in the gay population of New York that's declassified I mean you'd be
[01:57:18.540 --> 01:57:25.620]  crazy to take anything these people push they they should be arrested convicted
[01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:31.020]  tried in jail or in a desert island for the rest of their lives or whatever the
[01:57:31.020 --> 01:57:36.620]  max possible sentence that a murderer could get is that would be justice that
[01:57:36.620 --> 01:57:42.020]  would be the right thing to do now the way that we got to start doing this is
[01:57:42.020 --> 01:57:47.460]  to break the blockade of this media blackout and to force people to
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:53.020]  recognize that the media is just another arm of the government and the
[01:57:53.020 --> 01:57:57.740]  vaccine manufacturers to keep people from knowing what's going on they're
[01:57:57.740 --> 01:58:05.540]  complicit to there's blood on their hand CNN CBS NBC ABC all the networks all the
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:11.700]  wire services New York Times they've all got blood on their hand that's right I
[01:58:11.700 --> 01:58:13.940]  want to come back and talk more about how we get the story out to people a
[01:58:13.940 --> 01:58:20.220]  major author major scientist major respected comes out while he's in good
[01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:24.460]  standing and and says what we already know you know Mercury's not good for
[01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:27.980]  your child's brain not to mention the pathogen that's in there that causes the
[01:58:27.980 --> 01:58:32.420]  autoimmune response mercury and the the aluminum is a small part of it I mean
[01:58:32.420 --> 01:58:37.460]  this is a scourge folks the children it's on purpose and if this ever comes out
[01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:42.700]  they're all coming down that's why there's a blackout I take kids getting
[01:58:42.700 --> 01:58:46.220]  brain damaged on purpose real serious communications radio I mean I'm in a you

[01:58:49.180 --> 01:58:53.660]  what do you think about the FBI saying that there's a terror alert on Monday
[01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:57.980]  about a potential for hood situation the police are shoving people shoving Alex

[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:31.660]  it's completely normal that I'm having a very aggressive response right now this
[02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:37.380]  is normal the million activity that if you learn somebody in the village was
[02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:40.940]  putting poison on apples and giving them the kids and everybody was wondering
[02:00:40.940 --> 02:00:45.100]  why so many kids in the village couldn't talk and were sick you'd go find out who
[02:00:45.100 --> 02:00:51.660]  mess with the apples and they would get drawn and quartered and I don't have
[02:00:51.660 --> 02:01:00.100]  some instinct to want to kill people I love everybody except scum and I know
[02:01:00.100 --> 02:01:03.700]  about the eugenicist I know about the tinkering manipulations going on and
[02:01:03.700 --> 02:01:07.300]  and John Rapport what does this say investigative journalists about the
[02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:14.140]  elite that they get off on sitting back and socially engineering and and and
[02:01:14.140 --> 02:01:21.580]  cancer viruses and pathogens and nanotech and flu simulants and all the
[02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:24.620]  other bill amount of gates with mosquitoes that inoculate you see you

[02:01:29.940 --> 02:01:35.460]  GMO social engineering it's all admitted what a group of evil freaks
[02:01:35.460 --> 02:01:40.300]  everything they do creating al-Qaeda letting them murder Christians who are
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:44.980]  these people how do we get this report out John Rapport well these people are
[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:49.340]  evil I mean what else is there to say about it they'd like being evil it's
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:54.700]  not just that they feel guilty about it or they feel compelled they like it
[02:01:54.700 --> 02:01:58.620]  that's what they do yeah I know what I want to do it's hard for people to
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:02:04.980]  understand that but you know that's the deal they want to inflict torture they
[02:02:04.980 --> 02:02:10.500]  want to kill people quickly slowly every possible they love each child whose
[02:02:10.500 --> 02:02:15.580]  life they've ruined will be in diapers when they're 45 that's right and so
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:19.980]  people can't you know fathom that well how could that be they must be trying to
[02:02:19.980 --> 02:02:24.740]  do the right thing no they're not yes there are many at lower levels people
[02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:30.820]  who are brainwashed yeah exactly but at the top we're talking about people who
[02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:36.940]  are completely evil and they escape because people can't believe that they
[02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:41.980]  exist that's what we have to get through to make people understand well there
[02:02:41.980 --> 02:02:46.180]  couldn't be somebody who's that evil oh yes there there is there are a number of
[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:51.060]  such people they're that evil Joseph Mengele was brought to the United States
[02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:55.500]  and then brought to South America because the military base people got so mad
[02:02:55.500 --> 02:03:01.740]  at him show us Klaus Barbie all of them I mean the stuff Joseph Mengele did the
[02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:07.580]  kids folks is nothing compared to what this does the whole euthanasia movement
[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:13.220]  in mental hospitals and so forth was really pioneered in America before
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:20.300]  World War two and it was sent over to Nazi Germany with blessings and that was
[02:03:20.300 --> 02:03:23.940]  the Nuremberg defense the Nazis caught up and laughed and said we learned all
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:27.500]  this from you we learned it from you that's what they said yeah how dare you
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:33.380]  as yeah sorry I'm ranting no no this is what we're dealing with and now we've
[02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:40.180]  got this story this chink in the armor that blows apart a fraudulent study
[02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:47.300]  major 2004 study done at CDC that shows that the authors cook the data they
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:53.860]  buried vital data and thereby proved in heavy quotes that the MMR vaccine
[02:03:53.860 --> 02:03:58.780]  was safe when it was actually creating autism and horrible effects on children
[02:03:58.780 --> 02:04:03.140]  one of the co-authors Wayne Thompson has admitted it he stepped forward he's
[02:04:03.140 --> 02:04:07.820]  released a statement in writing through his attorney Rick Morgan and now we have
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:14.940]  a chance to destroy the media blockade and force them to reveal themselves as
[02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:21.700]  the scum true scum that they actually are this is a chance that we have to get
[02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:25.740]  this story out we're going to take this video from the live show put it in a

[02:08:49.300 --> 02:08:55.420]  September 11th of this year so that's the next six seven days I don't know if
[02:08:55.420 --> 02:08:59.700]  it's a real credible threat I know ISIS is real I know they've got 11 wide body
[02:08:59.700 --> 02:09:04.580]  airplanes by seizing the Tripoli airport because our government armed them and
[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:08.140]  let them take over the country now they're taking everything over and I know
[02:09:08.140 --> 02:09:11.660]  that the system has been preparing for terror attacks to be used to take our
[02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:16.700]  freedoms and senator Rand Paul has now come out to time magazine and said
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:22.580]  Obama has created a jihadist wonderland as they expand territory in Syria Iraq

[02:09:44.580 --> 02:09:49.580]  nearly a minute I'm gonna play this at the bottom of the hour to solve nine

[02:09:54.540 --> 02:09:59.100]  ladies and gentlemen a four-year-old could solve that faster than that nine
[02:09:59.100 --> 02:10:08.380]  plus six nine and one means 10 you have five left 15 or 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16

[02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:41.780]  numbers start going down highest cancer rates lowest IQ lowest test scores more
[02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:52.340]  fluoride more vaccines more GMO more pesticides now former staff sergeant
[02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:58.060]  Joe Biggs reporting for info wars comm joins us and I point out his military
[02:10:58.060 --> 02:11:05.220]  background because he has sources which we will not reveal here on air they're
[02:11:05.220 --> 02:11:09.260]  at Fort bless they believe it's a real threat they close most the entrances the
[02:11:09.260 --> 02:11:12.580]  general's been briefed the general considers it to be a real threat we have
[02:11:12.580 --> 02:11:19.060]  that directly from the general's office I'll just leave it at that and there are
[02:11:19.060 --> 02:11:23.620]  other than Latin Americans other than Mexicans coming across thousands from
[02:11:23.620 --> 02:11:28.260]  the Middle East that broke weeks ago mainstream news in leaked border patrol
[02:11:28.260 --> 02:11:33.940]  internal security memos that show the numbers so this is going on it's in the
[02:11:33.940 --> 02:11:40.260]  news today that Obama lets known jihadis who are fighting for ISIS back into the
[02:11:40.260 --> 02:11:46.900]  US just like the UK does so let's get that straight let's get that straight just
[02:11:46.900 --> 02:11:50.900]  like they let five of the nine hijackers or from Saudi Arabia back in I had
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:55.980]  springman the head of the US Embassy on months after 9-11 who was ordered by the
[02:11:55.980 --> 02:12:00.820]  CIA to let Muhammad out of back into the US I don't know what happened on 9-11
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:05.180]  exactly but I know they they protected these people and we're not being given
[02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:08.620]  the whole story because they got to take our freedoms after 9-11 so whether
[02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:11.820]  this is gonna be a false flag whether it's a real attack or whether it isn't
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:16.220]  gonna happen they're using this to take our liberties Joe Biggs has learned a
[02:12:16.220 --> 02:12:19.740]  lot more he's got big news breaking tonight or tomorrow we're not gonna
[02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:25.180]  release that yet for his safety but Joe you got a lot of intel Roger that is Joe
[02:12:25.180 --> 02:12:30.100]  Biggs here with info wars.com you know the funny thing about this people keep
[02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:35.580]  saying that El Paso is a second safest city in the country and that you know
[02:12:35.580 --> 02:12:39.220]  people keep reiterating that our borders are secure you know I don't know how many
[02:12:39.220 --> 02:12:42.860]  times I have to continue to come down here Alex and show the American people
[02:12:42.860 --> 02:12:47.860]  how unsecure our borders are and how easy it is to gain access to America
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:53.380]  without even being seen you know I was at a spot yesterday for hours filming and
[02:12:53.380 --> 02:13:00.200]  not one agent came by no one was around we sat out there and filmed and it's
[02:13:00.200 --> 02:13:04.140]  literally and what a lot of the locals say they're like well there's mountains
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:07.420]  back there they're not gonna come through that well think about this where
[02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:10.840]  do they come from Iraq Afghanistan places like that the
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:14.680]  terrains just like this they're not there you know it's not new to them to
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:18.300]  cross a mountain to get somewhere so that's what people need to pull out of
[02:13:18.300 --> 02:13:21.260]  their head they need to start looking at the facts and you know another thing
[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:24.020]  that I don't like is people saying that that's fear-mongering it's not fear
[02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:26.780]  mongering what we're doing is we're trying to inform people so they can make
[02:13:26.780 --> 02:13:31.780]  good solid sound decisions in case something happens and the we've got
[02:13:31.780 --> 02:13:36.620]  11 missing airplanes out of Tripoli Al Qaeda's attacking Africa India they're
[02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:42.020]  taking over all of the place they've got 15,000 M pads we broke that first they
[02:13:42.020 --> 02:13:48.820]  are a real group they are a real threat Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabian Qatar fund
[02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:54.660]  the FSA in Syria we we give weapons to the FSA the FSA Free Syrian Army is
[02:13:54.660 --> 02:13:59.780]  known to support Al Qaeda Rand Paul has now come out and said Obama created a
[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:04.660]  jihadist wonderland I'm gonna explain it is staged folks but the globalists have
[02:14:04.660 --> 02:14:10.300]  funded them and turned them loose for our military and our police have a fight
[02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:15.900]  go ahead and people don't need to forget as well we traded five huge Taliban
[02:14:15.900 --> 02:14:21.820]  leaders for a Bo Bergdahl he went to Qatar Qatar funds terrorists did they
[02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:26.060]  really now because we gave in to the terrorism they're kidnapping men women
[02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:30.460]  and children journalist by the hundreds every day and chopping their heads off
[02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:35.140]  on TV yeah you know the Obama administration is Dr. Frankenstein
[02:14:35.140 --> 02:14:40.380]  ISIS is Frankenstein you know we are the town's people who are fed up but you
[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:45.300]  think Dr. Frankenstein is gonna kill his creation no his creation has gotten out
[02:14:45.300 --> 02:14:49.700]  of control the Obama administration's ISIS has gotten so out of control they
[02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:53.700]  are a real threat now you know it's beyond them at this point almost but it
[02:14:53.700 --> 02:14:57.180]  but they do use them for propaganda tools they are using them to topple
[02:14:57.180 --> 02:15:01.820]  these government that's a great analogy of the Frankenstein yes I mean they
[02:15:01.820 --> 02:15:05.380]  want us to go and then you know fight Syria now as well they want us to take
[02:15:05.380 --> 02:15:10.500]  out that regime you know the the Libyan rebels who were who took out Qaddafi
[02:15:10.500 --> 02:15:14.820]  were the we're sitting there with Al Qaeda guys right there with them those
[02:15:14.820 --> 02:15:20.660]  were the ISIS guys so this whole thing is just one big you know propaganda tool
[02:15:20.660 --> 02:15:26.100]  this is now ISIS is double-crossing the so-called non-radical Muslim jihadis
[02:15:26.100 --> 02:15:33.180]  in Syria in in Libya all over and killing them and then just blowing up and
[02:15:33.180 --> 02:15:37.540]  burning down the airport because there are a bunch of demons and flying off in
[02:15:37.540 --> 02:15:41.860]  the airplanes and then people say oh that's not a threat bull they're getting
[02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:44.980]  ready to launch terror attacks you can see it all being prepared and they're
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:48.700]  gonna use it to take our freedom we're down there to expose where they're
[02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:52.940]  saying the main attack may come to expose our borders wide open and to expose
[02:15:52.940 --> 02:15:57.580]  that it's a fraud to take our liberties regardless of what it is what does
[02:15:57.580 --> 02:16:01.380]  ISIS do they behead people they crucify people they murder people in mass
[02:16:01.380 --> 02:16:06.620]  numbers what happens in war is Alex the exact same thing that is a great spot a
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:11.180]  strategic location for ISIS because they fit in they do the exact same stuff and
[02:16:11.180 --> 02:16:15.100]  we now know that ISIS is the largest funded terrorist organization in the
[02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:18.540]  world and why is that because they keep taking over these oil refiners in the
[02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:22.580]  Middle East right down the road to my left is a Western refinery it's a very
[02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:27.740]  large oil refinery right across the border maybe 300 yards away from Warren
[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:31.340]  and they wouldn't be able to take that over they could blow it up or the
[02:16:31.340 --> 02:16:35.580]  globalist could blow it up have some ISIS patsies kill them in a helicopter
[02:16:35.580 --> 02:16:40.500]  attack and still use that to take our freedoms bottom line these Frankenstein's
[02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:45.260]  got created and funded and turned loose by the criminals running our government
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:52.500]  as Rand Paul has said Obama has created a jihadist wonderland that's what
[02:16:52.500 --> 02:16:57.660]  we're saying it's the truth and I have never supported all these wars you can't
[02:16:57.660 --> 02:17:01.020]  trust Obama to run airstrikes to lastly take them out that's why they're
[02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:05.140]  clearly bombing a few empty trucks and and you know because it's blowing up an
[02:17:05.140 --> 02:17:11.540]  Obama's face but yeah you basically have to bomb ISIS now in Syria and Iraq but
[02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:15.740]  the type of airstrikes we're seeing one or two a day is nothing but show Joe I
[02:17:15.740 --> 02:17:19.300]  mean it's not effective it's not effective in any way in any combat way
[02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:23.540]  what they're doing is ineffective it they might be taking away small numbers
[02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:27.820]  we actually have the manpower if we had a legitimate government in place with a
[02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:31.500]  president who actually loved his country we could take this out in a matter of
[02:17:31.500 --> 02:17:34.940]  days and be done with it not have to worry about it but like I said they're
[02:17:34.940 --> 02:17:40.180]  his creation that's his baby he's not gonna kill it he wants instead continue
[02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:44.300]  giving it money give it more weapons and put fear in the hearts of Americans and
[02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:50.700]  try to take our liberties away that's it and what's crazy Joe is that our
[02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:56.220]  government openly funded the Muslim Brotherhood openly funded ISIS openly
[02:17:56.220 --> 02:18:01.100]  let them have bases our own military and Americans will will clearly still go no
[02:18:01.100 --> 02:18:04.220]  that that's not true that's not true you can give them the information we could
[02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:09.140]  even bring ISIS and have them in the same room as Obama with La Raza hugging
[02:18:09.140 --> 02:18:15.860]  and people to go nah that's not real undoubtedly the we knew from Colonel
[02:18:15.860 --> 02:18:19.780]  Schaefer days after Benghazi he said exactly what's been confirmed now with
[02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:23.580]  the impads and the Turkish ambassador and our ambassador being killed and the
[02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:27.500]  stand-down being ordered to cover it up for plausible deniability when they use
[02:18:27.500 --> 02:18:35.980]  those impads why did Obama want al-Qaeda now called IS to have impads Joe because
[02:18:35.980 --> 02:18:41.980]  they want plausible deniability when they shut down air traffic in Europe or
[02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:47.580]  the US with those impads I'm telling you they're gonna use al-Qaeda in a deal
[02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:52.020]  with Saudi Arabia to bring in martial law in America I'm telling you you can
[02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:55.420]  see that this is one of their major plans I don't know they're gonna do it
[02:18:55.420 --> 02:19:00.100]  hopefully exposing it will stop them Joe yeah hopefully so I mean because we saw
[02:19:00.100 --> 02:19:03.940]  how quick martial law can go into effect you know and that two weeks were in
[02:19:03.940 --> 02:19:09.020]  Ferguson it was a mind-blowing to see how quick they were able to enforce that
[02:19:09.020 --> 02:19:13.020]  and then start putting in curfews and shooting at the crowds and attacking
[02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:16.500]  journalists so the truth couldn't get out that's what if they let this happen
[02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:20.940]  if we don't expose this this Ferguson can happen all across the country and
[02:19:20.940 --> 02:19:23.860]  that's what we have to stop from happening they've been trying to start a
[02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:27.460]  civil war Joe I totally agree and again we're not demonizing the police or
[02:19:27.460 --> 02:19:30.500]  military they're in the middle like citizens I want to come back and ask
[02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:33.340]  you about other things you've learned while you're there I also want to get

[02:19:47.020 --> 02:19:51.420]  videos of Joe saying oh this is fear-mongering no ISIS is taking over
[02:19:51.420 --> 02:19:56.540]  major countries right now they're a real group of nuts I'm the guy that
[02:19:56.540 --> 02:20:01.860]  exposed 9-11 is false flag folks okay virtually anyone can hack your cell

[02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:58.620]  that's 1-800-281-6805
[02:24:09.140 --> 02:24:14.900]  we see massive preparations for global war martial law we see the globalist
[02:24:14.900 --> 02:24:18.860]  launching attacks in Ukraine the Middle East turning al-Qaeda loose against Russia
[02:24:18.860 --> 02:24:24.220]  we see massive funding being given to these groups we see the pipelines not
[02:24:24.220 --> 02:24:28.180]  being cut off that ISIS has been allowed to control Saudi Arabia has been
[02:24:28.180 --> 02:24:33.780]  allowed control of oil fields in Iraq they're using that to fund ISIS because
[02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:38.780]  they can't get Congress to openly fund ISIS in the attack on Syria part of the
[02:24:38.780 --> 02:24:43.740]  deal is then ISIS will attack Western interest so the West can push the fake
[02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:47.540]  war on terror and the rollout of the armored vehicles and the checkpoints
[02:24:47.540 --> 02:24:54.860]  that's really going to be used on the Tea Party and that's all public ISIS has
[02:24:54.860 --> 02:24:59.780]  billions of dollars now and is allowed to operate on Twitter and Facebook is
[02:24:59.780 --> 02:25:03.300]  allowed to fly to the US is allowed to go back to England they're going to
[02:25:03.300 --> 02:25:09.220]  rehabilitate the jihadis this is an invisible army secret army if you don't
[02:25:09.220 --> 02:25:13.780]  know about the CIA and black ops folks you better learn about it quick and you're
[02:25:13.780 --> 02:25:17.380]  like well that's our CIA no it's not it's run by foreign banks it's
[02:25:17.380 --> 02:25:21.900]  collaborator they don't want a free market in this country and we have a
[02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:25.420]  lot of CIA people and army people they're telling us what's really happening
[02:25:25.420 --> 02:25:29.260]  because they're good guys in the government most the mid-level and low
[02:25:29.260 --> 02:25:33.940]  level and even some high level are good people in fact they've gone so far now
[02:25:33.940 --> 02:25:39.500]  that the system's in trouble because our military is decompartmentalized and the
[02:25:39.500 --> 02:25:45.500]  police are decompartmentalizing and the system Joe Biggs I think the globalists
[02:25:45.500 --> 02:25:49.420]  have gone too far and when they have ISIS shoot down airliners in Europe or
[02:25:49.420 --> 02:25:54.820]  Israel or here people are going to get major trouble I don't see them getting
[02:25:54.820 --> 02:26:01.780]  away with this Joe I don't here's the thing my gut I can see the setup with
[02:26:01.780 --> 02:26:06.980]  all the crazy stuff the world blowing up as Hagel has said this is clearly part
[02:26:06.980 --> 02:26:12.580]  of this season of destabilization by design but al Qaeda known as ISIS is
[02:26:12.580 --> 02:26:17.980]  real and they are a real threat could it be a smoke screen for false flag we
[02:26:17.980 --> 02:26:23.180]  don't know but we're upset because if you look at the constellation of stuff
[02:26:23.180 --> 02:26:28.940]  going on and the preparations it fits in and you can just the tumblers are
[02:26:28.940 --> 02:26:33.660]  clicking here folks and I am just really concerned Joe and they're getting
[02:26:33.660 --> 02:26:37.580]  but they're preparing themselves as well so that's what I don't get why can't we
[02:26:37.580 --> 02:26:41.660]  as citizens talk about something like this without be called fear mongers or
[02:26:41.660 --> 02:26:46.340]  conspiracy theorists things like that we see the setup we see the endgame we see
[02:26:46.340 --> 02:26:50.180]  what's happening behind the curtain and all we're trying to do is inform people
[02:26:50.180 --> 02:26:53.980]  give them information so they can make really good decisions you know that's
[02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:58.260]  all we try to do here is bring people facts so they can sit back and look at
[02:26:58.260 --> 02:27:02.340]  all the pieces put the puddles puzzle together themselves and go okay I see it
[02:27:02.340 --> 02:27:06.500]  now all right so the more people who understand what's going on the you know
[02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:10.340]  the better chance we have at defeating this and keeping this from happening but
[02:27:10.340 --> 02:27:13.740]  the sad thing is though maybe they will do something like that and I just hope
[02:27:13.740 --> 02:27:18.420]  that God they don't why did our government give Libya and give Syria and
[02:27:18.420 --> 02:27:23.100]  part of Iraq to al Qaeda and then change its name to confuse everybody because
[02:27:23.100 --> 02:27:26.540]  they've been caught funding him and now we're being told imminent terror attack
[02:27:26.540 --> 02:27:31.900]  about to happen if they let them attack us bare minimum on 9-11 and folks I'm
[02:27:31.900 --> 02:27:35.780]  telling you the next one's going to be bigger and so whatever's going to be
[02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:42.300]  behind it I feel another 9-11 coming and I said it two months before 9-11 that I
[02:27:42.300 --> 02:27:45.500]  thought they blow up the World Trade Centers and blame it on their asset
[02:27:45.500 --> 02:27:49.820]  bin Laden I'm on record my spidey sense tells me they're getting ready to do it
[02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:54.500]  I'm trying to expose it hoping we can stop it and then if we stop it people say
[02:27:54.500 --> 02:27:58.700]  oh there's no big deal let me tell you it's a real 9-11 if you're in Libya
[02:27:58.700 --> 02:28:02.940]  getting your head chopped off by these people or an Iraq or Syria or or in
[02:28:02.940 --> 02:28:08.060]  India or in Africa they are they are launching attacks all over the world on
[02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:13.060]  shopping malls they're blowing stuff up every day in Nigeria these people are out
[02:28:13.060 --> 02:28:18.980]  of control yeah I mean there's no it's not a hoax to these people like you said
[02:28:18.980 --> 02:28:24.460]  in Iraq and in the town of a Ribi where people are just being murdered it is
[02:28:24.460 --> 02:28:29.500]  mind-blowing and people see this and they still want to think it can't happen
[02:28:29.500 --> 02:28:34.780]  here it can't happen here but we've let stuff happen Pearl Harbor 9-11 all these
[02:28:34.780 --> 02:28:38.860]  things we've let happen in the past we don't have a really strong rapport with
[02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:43.100]  saying that you know this is impossible it's never gonna happen every time
[02:28:43.100 --> 02:28:47.300]  something like this happens we have our hands in it our FBI sets up people and
[02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:51.060]  tries to set them up as a terrorist you know our whole government for the most
[02:28:51.060 --> 02:28:55.220]  part is corrupt as hell and I'm mad about it I know you're mad about it and
[02:28:55.220 --> 02:28:59.060]  all we can do is talk to people and tell people these are the facts open your
[02:28:59.060 --> 02:29:02.940]  eyes do something well the government pulls stuff like this because the
[02:29:02.940 --> 02:29:07.180]  public acts like a bunch of chumps oh because they're all they're like zombies
[02:29:07.180 --> 02:29:11.220]  now you come to some of these cities now people are just they just walk around
[02:29:11.220 --> 02:29:14.820]  with their heads down they're staring at their little handheld about half the
[02:29:14.820 --> 02:29:19.700]  people one mile from two nuclear reactors on four fault lines half the
[02:29:19.700 --> 02:29:23.300]  people that we talked to in California didn't know there was a plant called the
[02:29:23.300 --> 02:29:28.940]  devil built on fault lines a mile from them it's mind-blowing to know that
[02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:36.020]  people are just so dumb down it's idiocracy it really is and then
[02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:38.780]  meanwhile those of us that aren't dumb down we don't have all the answers but
[02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:42.460]  we at least know what's going on they didn't laugh at us because we're
[02:29:42.460 --> 02:29:45.580]  informed I want to ask you a few more questions coming up with Joe Biggs we
[02:29:45.580 --> 02:29:49.740]  got a bunch of other news as well stay with us we're live it is we're on the March

[02:33:49.860 --> 02:33:53.940]  we know history and know what happens when good men and women do nothing evil
[02:33:53.940 --> 02:33:57.540]  takes over we're talking to Joe Biggs who's got a bunch of special reports
[02:33:57.540 --> 02:34:02.740]  breaking tonight and tomorrow I'm not gonna tell you what they are yet I don't
[02:34:02.740 --> 02:34:06.860]  want to shift gears the guy running camera has also a reporter and of course
[02:34:06.860 --> 02:34:13.740]  that is Josh Owens Josh give us your take on what you've seen down there the
[02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:21.300]  last two days at joint test for six Fort Bliss in El Paso with Juarez just a
[02:34:21.300 --> 02:34:27.540]  mile away what you've witnessed what you've seen Josh Owens well as a lot of
[02:34:27.540 --> 02:34:34.620]  people know that they have last weekend they shut down two entrances to Fort
[02:34:34.620 --> 02:34:39.300]  Bliss after a judicial watch came out and said that ISIS was in Juarez which is
[02:34:39.300 --> 02:34:45.780]  literally baby 400 feet behind us right now and what we've seen here is the
[02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:50.420]  borders are open the same thing that we saw in Arizona I'm sure people remember
[02:34:50.420 --> 02:34:54.540]  Joe Biggs walked right across the border in Arizona we did the same thing here
[02:34:54.540 --> 02:34:58.220]  yesterday you can see that video on YouTube we posted it yesterday proof
[02:34:58.220 --> 02:35:02.380]  that ISIS can come into America so what we've seen here is what we've seen in
[02:35:02.380 --> 02:35:06.980]  Arizona and other parts of Texas in California is that the borders are wide
[02:35:06.980 --> 02:35:13.060]  open and I think a big question is like we brought up in another video is will
[02:35:13.060 --> 02:35:17.140]  Democrats be blamed when ISIS comes into America and yeah I'm sure ISIS has
[02:35:17.140 --> 02:35:20.820]  already had sleeper cells inside of America but if they're on the southern
[02:35:20.820 --> 02:35:25.180]  border and they're going to come in here you know are they going to be on TV on
[02:35:25.180 --> 02:35:28.860]  the mainstream media playing in the hearts and minds of people trying to
[02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:32.860]  convince them that it's still okay for our borders to be open when people are
[02:35:32.860 --> 02:35:39.220]  being attacked and this becomes the Gaza Strip it's disgusting totally
[02:35:39.220 --> 02:35:45.700]  disgusting and again Al Qaeda was created and organized by Western forces
[02:35:45.700 --> 02:35:50.620]  turned loose protected I've interviewed the head of the stratos ivy task force
[02:35:50.620 --> 02:35:55.060]  who could have killed bin Laden twice the week before 9-11 Colonel Schaefer I
[02:35:55.060 --> 02:35:59.660]  mean I'm an expert on this I live this every day just like my crew does I
[02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:06.580]  follow it and and now they've never funded Al Qaeda like this they've turned
[02:36:06.580 --> 02:36:11.500]  them loose the West is clearly arming them clearly training them just six
[02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:15.380]  months ago our own military went public and said we're in bases in Jordan and
[02:36:15.380 --> 02:36:21.660]  Turkey and and and Western Iraq training Al Qaeda jihadis and we're not
[02:36:21.660 --> 02:36:25.340]  going to do it anymore and now that's all come out in the news we didn't make
[02:36:25.340 --> 02:36:33.620]  that up folks I mean I have CIA army I mean generals okay and I get info and
[02:36:33.620 --> 02:36:36.220]  I'm not gonna say how I get it but it's like Matt drudge says go to a parking
[02:36:36.220 --> 02:36:39.980]  garage in fact it's got the point I don't have the time or energy is too
[02:36:39.980 --> 02:36:42.500]  dangerous I already know what's going on this I don't even need to talk to
[02:36:42.500 --> 02:36:49.180]  contacts anymore I mean we've got our government clearly at a criminal level
[02:36:49.180 --> 02:36:53.660]  moving these people into position they're gonna hit Europe or hit the
[02:36:53.660 --> 02:36:57.980]  United States or both and again they wanted those impads covered up but
[02:36:57.980 --> 02:37:03.460]  given to them and Ambassador Stevens wouldn't go along with it so the Turkish
[02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:07.580]  ambassador left they attacked most people pulled out of the safe house they
[02:37:07.580 --> 02:37:11.380]  were given warning but then they were even sabotaged at their houses the
[02:37:11.380 --> 02:37:17.820]  jihadis had inside intel secret security passes two Navy SEALs ran down
[02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:24.460]  there CIA Navy SEALs cheap dip SEALs held them down for five hours three hours
[02:37:24.460 --> 02:37:28.020]  into it that's why the whole world learned about it and the military learned
[02:37:28.020 --> 02:37:33.380]  and sat there and watched the stand down ordered by the Joint Chiefs via Obama
[02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:39.700]  so that's the bottom line why did they want the warehouses of impads given to
[02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:45.340]  Al Qaeda because they're going to use it to bring the West to a standstill and
[02:37:45.340 --> 02:37:50.980]  I'm here exposing it so the intelligence agencies I know you're not stupid but
[02:37:50.980 --> 02:37:55.580]  I'm just gonna state what's going on for you at the lower level and mid level so
[02:37:55.580 --> 02:38:01.340]  all of you understand there is a major play to hit the West with thousands of
[02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:08.140]  impads and now they've got 11 missing passenger jets I mean this it could be a
[02:38:08.140 --> 02:38:14.380]  new 9-11 with 11 aircraft and an attack from the ground I mean my I mean oh
[02:38:14.380 --> 02:38:18.380]  they're setting up a mega 9-11 I'm sorry Josh go ahead I'm so angry right now I
[02:38:18.380 --> 02:38:23.860]  am so I am just I just can't handle it anymore I this this traitorous government
[02:38:23.860 --> 02:38:29.700]  makes me want to throw up it may and all the traders that MSNBC that attack us
[02:38:29.700 --> 02:38:34.660]  and Pierce Morgan and all you scum why are you such trash why are you such
[02:38:34.660 --> 02:38:40.600]  criminals why are you so evil what is your problem that murder a 200,000
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:44.660]  Christians with their heads being chopped off is on your hands I want you to
[02:38:44.660 --> 02:38:50.620]  know that you filthy dishonorable scum Josh go ahead I gotta settle down well
[02:38:50.620 --> 02:38:54.060]  no I mean obviously I completely agree with everything you're saying and it's
[02:38:54.060 --> 02:38:58.900]  it's unbelievable and like we talked about earlier we have some stuff coming
[02:38:58.900 --> 02:39:03.660]  up tonight and tomorrow on the show that is going to put it in people's faces
[02:39:03.660 --> 02:39:08.580]  and show them just how serious and just how dangerous these open borders are and
[02:39:08.580 --> 02:39:12.780]  this whole situation is and there will be no doubt after we do what we're gonna
[02:39:12.780 --> 02:39:16.860]  do that people won't be able to see with their own eyes what's happening here
[02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:22.260]  and what can happen don't tell them too much just in fact I'm gonna let you go
[02:39:22.260 --> 02:39:28.220]  great job anything else you want to add no I just it's unbelievable we see it
[02:39:28.220 --> 02:39:32.100]  over and over again and I just I want people to wake up and see what's going
[02:39:32.100 --> 02:39:36.980]  on and stop it from happening our government has turned loose over a
[02:39:36.980 --> 02:39:43.420]  hundred thousand crazy people with 15,000 surface air missiles and the borders
[02:39:43.420 --> 02:39:47.780]  open that's what I meant and I see the idiots on YouTube it's a minority of them
[02:39:47.780 --> 02:39:53.220]  saying Joe Biggs and I are fear mongers bringing this up man let me tell you
[02:39:53.220 --> 02:39:57.660]  something I don't know how much stuff we got to predict accurately here and then
[02:39:57.660 --> 02:40:01.420]  the stuff we do talk about that we're able to stop this isn't about a radio
[02:40:01.420 --> 02:40:05.140]  show it isn't about being big shots it didn't about it's about saving this
[02:40:05.140 --> 02:40:12.140]  country anything else you said it all I just I just urge people just like you
[02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:16.260]  have for years and years to realize how serious this is it's not a joke it's not
[02:40:16.260 --> 02:40:23.820]  a game and and people need to realize when you're talking to the locals or any
[02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:26.820]  of them concerned or is it only the military you talk to that's concerned
[02:40:26.820 --> 02:40:31.500]  there have been locals that are concerned a lot of them aren't hearing much
[02:40:31.500 --> 02:40:37.260]  about it in the press in the area so you know some of them were unaware but most
[02:40:37.260 --> 02:40:42.460]  of them are concerned I mean when you hear something like 11 plus planes have
[02:40:42.460 --> 02:40:46.940]  been stolen the borders are open ISIS has been seen right across the border
[02:40:46.940 --> 02:40:52.100]  right here in El Paso right across the border in Juarez you would be a complete
[02:40:52.100 --> 02:40:57.260]  moron not to be worried and not not to be concerned and unless all you're doing
[02:40:57.260 --> 02:41:01.340]  is staring at a TV screen all day or your phone other than that I mean you
[02:41:01.340 --> 02:41:07.660]  would be insane not to be concerned about what's going on and again if they
[02:41:07.660 --> 02:41:12.100]  kill thousands of people it's sad it's bad statistically you know we can handle
[02:41:12.100 --> 02:41:15.540]  it it's it's not that big of a thing in the aggregate except they're gonna take
[02:41:15.540 --> 02:41:21.100]  even more of our rights after this you know this they're gonna use this Al Qaeda
[02:41:21.100 --> 02:41:27.340]  attack number two 9-11 number two to totally butcher the Bill of Rights and
[02:41:27.340 --> 02:41:30.740]  Constitution and the military and everybody's being trained that the
[02:41:30.740 --> 02:41:35.100]  next wars with the Tea Party so see they're gonna develop and set up the
[02:41:35.100 --> 02:41:40.020]  precedent for a total Orwellian police state and then they're going to flip it
[02:41:40.020 --> 02:41:46.580]  around on us it's already happened this is not me 13 years ago predicting it
[02:41:46.580 --> 02:41:49.820]  that they would turn this around on the American people that's already happened
[02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:56.460]  we're now predicting the next phase and desperately trying to stop it because
[02:41:56.460 --> 02:41:59.100]  let me tell you something folks they do a couple more phases of this they're
[02:41:59.100 --> 02:42:02.300]  gonna come kill me they're gonna come arrest me I mean you understand folks
[02:42:02.300 --> 02:42:07.220]  I'm I'm in this to win it I know this isn't a game okay I live in the real
[02:42:07.220 --> 02:42:11.580]  world I know I'm getting threatened by these IS people and they're messing with
[02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:16.300]  I mean I don't even get into it okay I know that the globalist are using them
[02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:21.460]  as a secret army I know they brought 5,000 Iraqis in after the Gulf War that
[02:42:21.460 --> 02:42:25.500]  they use as sleeper cells and I even came out in the news I know how much
[02:42:25.500 --> 02:42:30.660]  trouble we're in and I'm just telling you only an understanding of you're a
[02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:36.780]  foreign banking cartel how do you bring the US down you organize fun jihadis
[02:42:36.780 --> 02:42:43.020]  let them attack use the attack to take over the society set up a total grid and
[02:42:43.020 --> 02:42:47.060]  then turn it around on the people it's very elementary ladies and gentlemen and
[02:42:47.060 --> 02:42:51.020]  it's what they're doing Josh Owens you guys go they've already shot some stuff

[02:43:25.420 --> 02:43:32.780]  week and a half no mainstream media picking it up our government has funded
[02:43:32.780 --> 02:43:35.900]  Al Qaeda to run around and blow up hundreds and hundreds of churches in
[02:43:35.900 --> 02:43:41.740]  Iraq and Syria they blew up the the you know the burying burial place the
[02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:49.580]  church with Jonah's grave they are just murdering this they have these crazy
[02:43:49.580 --> 02:43:54.700]  nuts just running around doing whatever they want and our filthy government
[02:43:54.700 --> 02:44:00.740]  runs them and it's not our government it's these illegitimate criminals who
[02:44:00.740 --> 02:44:05.740]  just get away with everything and I am just sick of it I mean how much more
[02:44:05.740 --> 02:44:12.380]  obvious does this stuff have to get and I'm gonna warn the criminals up there
[02:44:12.380 --> 02:44:17.460]  about something let me tell you something everybody I'm talking 90% now of the
[02:44:17.460 --> 02:44:20.500]  military I talked to I don't care if they're enlisted non-commissioned or
[02:44:20.500 --> 02:44:25.620]  officers they know what's going on you see this whistleblower from the CDC
[02:44:25.620 --> 02:44:29.580]  there's gonna be a lot more of that because let me tell you that guy from the
[02:44:29.580 --> 02:44:33.140]  CDC I guarantee it looks at the brain damage kids he sees at the mall and it
[02:44:33.140 --> 02:44:37.020]  work and a church every day and if stuff gets worse and worse people aren't
[02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:40.340]  just gonna sit around anymore and let you people get away with what you've done
[02:44:40.340 --> 02:44:44.300]  and when your ISIS crud goes around and blows up more stuff and kills more
[02:44:44.300 --> 02:44:48.620]  Christians you and other innocent people and other nonviolent Muslims you're
[02:44:48.620 --> 02:44:52.260]  gonna be held responsible for it
[02:44:55.740 --> 02:45:01.420]  I don't know what your problem is or why you want to do this to these countries
[02:45:01.420 --> 02:45:05.740]  that hadn't done nothing to anybody and why you people love evil so much but I
[02:45:05.740 --> 02:45:11.660]  know you do and I know you got to be stopped people can call me a weirdo all
[02:45:11.660 --> 02:45:17.660]  day that I want to throw up or turn this desk over right now because as a man
[02:45:17.660 --> 02:45:26.300]  just physically you people absolutely disgust me and and the people are in a
[02:45:26.300 --> 02:45:31.460]  trance that you got a breakout of your trance just like they say in network I
[02:45:31.460 --> 02:45:34.340]  don't know what to do about the inflation and the Russians and the crime of
[02:45:34.340 --> 02:45:37.940]  the streets all I know is first you've got to get mad you've got to say I'm a
[02:45:37.940 --> 02:45:44.740]  human being my life has a value and it's true you got a first to say I am
[02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:50.300]  breaking with this whole system and this whole thing it's a fraud it's a cancer
[02:45:50.300 --> 02:46:01.940]  I'm done with it you know how angry I got at the start of the show when I read
[02:46:01.940 --> 02:46:06.940]  this morning CBS News quoting the FBI saying we don't know what all these
[02:46:06.940 --> 02:46:12.380]  mystery towers are stealing everyone's data that aren't part of the telecoms but
[02:46:12.380 --> 02:46:16.500]  we it's probably not the government when they know full well almost all of it's
[02:46:16.500 --> 02:46:21.780]  the government sure there's some hackers out there as well so I had Mikhail
[02:46:21.780 --> 02:46:24.740]  failing this morning right this article that just got completed and just went
[02:46:24.740 --> 02:46:29.180]  up to prisonplanet.com and info wars.com and just got tweeted out this is
[02:46:29.180 --> 02:46:34.620]  unexclusive I don't care about the fact that we are the exclusive it's just this
[02:46:34.620 --> 02:46:39.540]  is the exclusive this is the answer this is the intel this is the truth this is
[02:46:39.540 --> 02:46:44.340]  the data this is the answers this is it right here this is the water in the
[02:46:44.340 --> 02:46:48.380]  desert this is the knowing the people perish for lack of knowledge we know
[02:46:48.380 --> 02:46:57.220]  and it's driven us crazy what we know I'm in a real humant threat fusion
[02:46:57.220 --> 02:47:02.340]  center of the people I live this stuff 18 hours a day I do nothing but interview
[02:47:02.340 --> 02:47:09.420]  the experts I know how the world works and I'm here just the same time I'm not
[02:47:09.420 --> 02:47:12.300]  emotional when I'm researching but once I get up here the three hours talk about
[02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:16.100]  I get sick of it I'm pleading with everyone just to wake up and wake
[02:47:16.100 --> 02:47:26.380]  others up because you're the answer to tyranny the answer to 1984 is 1776 it's
[02:47:26.380 --> 02:47:31.740]  saying no I will not go along with this anymore I will not have my name on it I
[02:47:31.740 --> 02:47:50.540]  will not bend over it is a criminal premeditated scientific takeover of
[02:47:50.540 --> 02:47:55.660]  absolute evil now I don't know what to do about all of it I just know we better
[02:47:55.660 --> 02:48:01.860]  have a cultural discussion about this exclusive mystery of rogue cell towers
[02:48:01.860 --> 02:48:06.660]  discovered feds attempt to downplay growing spy grid and we even have an
[02:48:06.660 --> 02:48:10.300]  NSA whistleblower that came through today a well-known one but with new data
[02:48:10.300 --> 02:48:14.220]  confirming our analysis and saying they're denying these are government
[02:48:14.220 --> 02:48:18.940]  cell towers because they don't even want to pay the companies for the data or
[02:48:18.940 --> 02:48:22.900]  get a warrant they're just grabbing and all illegally so the FBI is in CBS news
[02:48:22.900 --> 02:48:26.860]  denying it and this whistleblower confirmed that indeed this is part of
[02:48:26.860 --> 02:48:32.900]  their parallel program where they have to fix the stuff for court later and go
[02:48:32.900 --> 02:48:38.580]  lie in court and claim how they got the information exclusive mystery of rogue
[02:48:38.580 --> 02:48:41.740]  cell towers discovered feds attempt to downplay growing spy grid
[02:48:41.740 --> 02:48:46.020]  mckelthalen recent reports of rogue cell phone towers being used across the
[02:48:46.020 --> 02:48:50.260]  country to intercept mobile cell phone data is drawing a response from federal
[02:48:50.260 --> 02:48:53.900]  agents who claim the towers are not being used by law enforcement groups I
[02:48:53.900 --> 02:48:58.220]  doubt they're installed by law enforcement as they're yeah they're
[02:48:58.220 --> 02:49:02.060]  just only on city polls require a warrant to intercept conversations or data
[02:49:02.060 --> 02:49:05.500]  and since the cell providers are ordered by the court to operate with the
[02:49:05.500 --> 02:49:10.780]  intercept they really would be needed to do this former FBI agent Ross Rice
[02:49:10.780 --> 02:49:16.900]  told CBS Chicago most likely there's there being carried out by hackers well
[02:49:16.900 --> 02:49:20.540]  certainly there's some of that law enforcement's fight to keep these systems
[02:49:20.540 --> 02:49:25.740]  in place is likely rooted in one thing parallel construction and then we go
[02:49:25.740 --> 02:49:30.540]  into our investigative reports from last year that caused the city to say
[02:49:30.540 --> 02:49:35.540]  remove them they're illegal in Seattle headline new mesh network documents
[02:49:35.540 --> 02:49:44.100]  confirm police vehicles real-time access to DHS spy cameras use to conceal how
[02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:47.820]  law enforcement investigation began parallel construction allows police to
[02:49:47.820 --> 02:49:52.180]  create a criminal case while concealing how the evidence obtained illegally was
[02:49:52.180 --> 02:49:59.460]  acquired speaking exclusively to info wars comm nsa whistleblower kirk yb who
[02:49:59.460 --> 02:50:04.940]  we be who helped develop the data processing system thin thread breaks
[02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:08.740]  down the danger of surveillance and parallel construction then the report
[02:50:08.740 --> 02:50:13.700]  goes into the fact that it's a seattle chicago contracts with the hubs who runs
[02:50:13.700 --> 02:50:19.020]  them secret maps from the city from homeland security of how the the towers
[02:50:19.020 --> 02:50:24.140]  work we have photos of the towers up in seattle and other cities that's what
[02:50:24.140 --> 02:50:29.420]  they are okay the article's good he wrote it quickly but first he gets into my
[02:50:29.420 --> 02:50:32.900]  point about parallel construction and the whistleblower but really we probably
[02:50:32.900 --> 02:50:37.100]  want to point a note out in a read deeper we show how the hubs are being put
[02:50:37.100 --> 02:50:42.540]  in by homeland security but but that's what they are because they don't want to
[02:50:42.540 --> 02:50:47.580]  have to get it from the telecoms even with a blanket fiza warrant that lets
[02:50:47.580 --> 02:50:51.900]  them scoop it up they want firsthand real-time access to it all so they're
[02:50:51.900 --> 02:50:55.820]  putting them up with stingray systems you name it to scoop it all up here's the

[03:00:52.300 --> 03:00:56.100]  ahead and go to this video it's from Kit Daniels article common core creates a
[03:00:56.100 --> 03:01:01.220]  dumb-down obedient population here is the teacher we'll give you the tells after
[03:01:01.220 --> 03:01:08.940]  the video we used to just memorize 9 plus 6 equals 15 not anymore with the
[03:01:08.940 --> 03:01:12.780]  common core students need to understand why that's the case and Mrs. Ryan is
[03:01:12.780 --> 03:01:17.220]  here to explain thank you so our young learners might not be all together
[03:01:17.220 --> 03:01:22.300]  comfortable thinking about what 9 plus 6 is they are quite comfortable thinking
[03:01:22.300 --> 03:01:27.380]  about their friend 10 10 is emphasized in our young grades as we're working in a
[03:01:27.380 --> 03:01:34.340]  base 10 system so if we can partner 9 to a number and anchor 10 we can help our
[03:01:34.340 --> 03:01:40.540]  students see what 9 plus 6 is so we're going to decompose our sex and we know
[03:01:40.540 --> 03:01:47.060]  6 is made up of parts one of its parts is a 1 and the other part is a 5 we're
[03:01:47.060 --> 03:01:54.500]  now going to anchor our 9 to a 1 allowing our students to anchor to that 10
[03:01:54.500 --> 03:02:03.420]  now our students are seeing that we have 10 plus 5 being having now more
[03:02:03.420 --> 03:02:08.460]  comfort seeing that 10 plus 5 is 15 much more comfortable than looking at 9
[03:02:08.460 --> 03:02:14.620]  oh my god an isolated math fact all right you got all that no and with a
[03:02:14.620 --> 03:02:19.340]  straight face mercury is good for your children this just in Joan Rivers has
[03:02:19.340 --> 03:02:30.980]  died Joan Rivers is dead and that's all we know so Joan Rivers just died that is
[03:02:30.980 --> 03:02:36.980]  being reported by Fox News they can put it up on screen if you want I mean I got
[03:02:36.980 --> 03:02:45.380]  to tell you something right now Joan Rivers kind of symbolizes to me the
[03:02:45.380 --> 03:02:52.460]  whole Babylonian structure and but I want to say something bad of the dead I
[03:02:52.460 --> 03:02:59.060]  mean I rest in peace our daughter said comedian Joan Rivers has died after
[03:02:59.060 --> 03:03:09.500]  getting a surgery and there you go so she is gone as we all will make that
[03:03:09.500 --> 03:03:16.220]  journey some sooner rather than later and I guess there's a lot of plastic
[03:03:16.220 --> 03:03:23.580]  surgery for the face and stuff but I guess not for the internal parts so I
[03:03:23.580 --> 03:03:27.420]  just wish people like her could use their power something other than tabloid
[03:03:27.420 --> 03:03:34.580]  journalism but there you go she's dead so she's crossing the river sticks right
[03:03:34.580 --> 03:03:40.100]  now and I'll have some comment on that in a video that I'll shoot right after
[03:03:40.100 --> 03:03:48.180]  the show that'll be on the nightly news tonight 7 o'clock central but we we we
[03:03:48.180 --> 03:03:54.220]  hope that Joan Rivers rest in peace you know early on I said that Robin Williams
[03:03:54.220 --> 03:03:59.980]  was probably you know on psychotropics and stuff turned out he was and it says
[03:03:59.980 --> 03:04:04.020]  on the inside I can make you my suicide in this case you know a lot of it is
[03:04:04.020 --> 03:04:09.380]  just you get old and a lot of people don't do too well when they're put under
[03:04:09.380 --> 03:04:15.780]  anesthesia and so I'm sure there'll be conspiracy theories that pop up and all
[03:04:15.780 --> 03:04:21.260]  those do is just credit all the real examples of things that are real real
[03:04:21.260 --> 03:04:28.300]  conspiracies but very worldly woman some are already arguing guessing that she
[03:04:28.300 --> 03:04:32.580]  would die because she dared to say that Michelle was a transvestite and Obama's
[03:04:32.580 --> 03:04:38.580]  gay a lot of evidence Obama is gay I don't know about the Michelle thing she
[03:04:38.580 --> 03:04:42.980]  looks more like a giant reanimated snapping turtle to me maybe like one of
[03:04:42.980 --> 03:04:46.940]  those guys got zealofites or something but that's it Joan Rivers is dead great
