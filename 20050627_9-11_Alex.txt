[00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.097]  Let's now go to our guest, and I tell you, he just breaks news story after news story on a daily basis.
[00:00:07.097 --> 00:00:12.363]  He's becoming, frankly, the most prolific writer on the web right now.
[00:00:12.363 --> 00:00:14.465]  He has just exploded out of the gates.
[00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:16.968]  He's been writing for years, but he's really on target.
[00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:22.309]  And just joining us again, Greg, thanks for coming on.
[00:00:22.309 --> 00:00:23.690]  Hey, thanks Alex.
[00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:25.151]  Thanks for the introduction.
[00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:26.432]  Oh, you bet.
[00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:34.619]  Let's go over, I mean, let's just start off with former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, then let's go into one of the janitors.
[00:00:34.619 --> 00:00:37.882]  And I've called some of these people in the years past who reported bombs.
[00:00:37.882 --> 00:00:41.165]  They've said, I've been told to shut up, firefighters, workers, others.
[00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:49.172]  Well, you know, Paul Craig Roberts is a very, very interesting man, a very intelligent man, a person that I enjoy talking to and basically enlightened me about his feelings.
[00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:09.916]  His interesting story is, I believe, and he said to me this, he said, Greg, you know, why don't you look at all these Republican defections?
[00:01:09.916 --> 00:01:11.256]  You know, that's a great story.
[00:01:11.256 --> 00:01:20.783]  There's a lot of people like me who are influential in the government who have just basically been either shunned in Washington by the neocons or basically kicked out.
[00:01:21.563 --> 00:01:23.865]  And Paul's a great example.
[00:01:23.865 --> 00:01:25.766]  I mean, listen to his story.
[00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.948]  He was back in the old days with Reagan.
[00:01:28.948 --> 00:01:32.770]  He was a Businessweek writer and also an assistant editor for Wall Street Journal.
[00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.033]  And many of his articles were hated by the liberals.
[00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:46.879]  So Paul, over the years, basically started his own... He syndicates a column which is very anti-Bush and very anti-Neocon.
[00:01:47.686 --> 00:01:53.109]  And, uh, he basically tells me it's very difficult to get anything published in the mainstream.
[00:01:53.109 --> 00:02:00.513]  Yeah, even the so-called... Even Paul, I mean, can't get things contrary to the administration or contrary to Bush.
[00:02:00.513 --> 00:02:01.414]  Well, I mean, that's the point.
[00:02:01.414 --> 00:02:08.798]  Even so-called liberal papers will only publish stupid, shallow, fake liberal arguments against Bush.
[00:02:08.798 --> 00:02:11.620]  They'll never let somebody come in with the real arguments.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.742]  Yeah, and Paul is a person that, you know, his opinions are respected.
[00:02:16.742 --> 00:02:18.423]  I mean, he knows people in the business.
[00:02:18.423 --> 00:02:20.624]  Well, he said it, Greg!
[00:02:20.624 --> 00:02:23.146]  And was basically hated by the liberals way back when.
[00:02:23.146 --> 00:02:27.748]  And now, I mean, look at the irony of the situation.
[00:02:27.748 --> 00:02:32.030]  And when you have him on in the next hour, he'll be able to explain it better than me.
[00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.592]  All I can say is, basically, he's a very interesting person.
[00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:36.753]  I love talking to him.
[00:02:37.253 --> 00:02:42.999]  He's got some great views, and it's just a shame that his views can't be heard by the heartland of America.
[00:02:42.999 --> 00:02:47.062]  Well, in your article you quote him, and he talks about how I've never changed.
[00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:48.504]  I'm still a conservative.
[00:02:48.504 --> 00:02:50.185]  The neocons are the opposite.
[00:02:50.185 --> 00:02:56.211]  And I've told real liberals, real Democrats that love big government and all this, I've said you should love George Bush!
[00:02:56.818 --> 00:03:03.460]  I mean, the biggest government ever, expanding all these welfare programs that are really just corporate welfare to control our lives?
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.720]  Right.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:15.164]  I mean, Ron Paul gave that speech two years ago, called Neocon, where he laid out how the fourth international, the Trotskyites, literally, the head of the fourth international, founded neoconism.
[00:03:15.164 --> 00:03:21.746]  And the other guy, Leon Strauss, out of Chicago, at the Economics University, I mean, he's an adherent of fascism.
[00:03:22.654 --> 00:03:31.480]  Yeah, I mean, you know, the real story, and basically, you know, kind of so people understand, you know, what's going on.
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:42.788]  My background, years ago, when I was an editor of my college newspaper, and I should add, we had to start another one because the college newspaper was funded by the university, and the op-ed has been kind of controlled stories.
[00:03:42.788 --> 00:03:46.791]  My whole idea back then, even then, it was just instinctive.
[00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:50.894]  You know, I wanted to get the voices of people that never get heard into the newspaper.
[00:03:51.494 --> 00:04:02.105]  And I did that at my college, and basically it accelerated my graduation when I discovered that the college president was using funds from the university to build his mansion.
[00:04:02.105 --> 00:04:04.187]  So back then, nothing's changed for me.
[00:04:04.187 --> 00:04:06.269]  I've always been the same.
[00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:12.456]  Stories of interest are those that never get in the paper, and so when you have a nose for news,
[00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:21.714]  Years ago I got out of journalism and 9-11 kind of pulled me back into it because basically I said, you know something, this is needed.
[00:04:21.714 --> 00:04:31.439]  People need to see something in the newspaper by a writer who knows how to write for the newspapers, knows their style, knows what they want, but you can't get it in.
[00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.761]  So basically I just started doing it the only way I could.
[00:04:34.761 --> 00:04:39.324]  It's pulled me away from most everything in my life and I think it's a worthwhile cause.
[00:04:39.324 --> 00:04:43.787]  And I'm not going to stop until all these people like Rodriguez are heard.
[00:04:44.756 --> 00:04:46.638]  By the way, we're going to get into him in a second.
[00:04:46.638 --> 00:04:53.624]  You also write for American Free Press and a bunch of other prominent alternative publications.
[00:04:53.624 --> 00:04:56.908]  Let's get into one of the heroes of 9-11.
[00:04:56.908 --> 00:05:00.691]  I'd heard his name before, but I could never get a hold of these individuals.
[00:05:00.691 --> 00:05:04.535]  How you got a hold of the maintenance man, Janitor William Rodriguez.
[00:05:05.155 --> 00:05:08.238]  Who reported on explosions coming from below.
[00:05:08.238 --> 00:05:14.062]  Let's, and he's not, literally folks, there's hundreds that reported this, but he's one of the folks that's willing to go public.
[00:05:14.062 --> 00:05:15.383]  Tell us about this guy.
[00:05:15.383 --> 00:05:16.645]  Well, let me tell you about William.
[00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:20.848]  He's very sincere and he's very credible.
[00:05:20.848 --> 00:05:34.379]  And the reason I say that is when William is kind of, throughout the years, he's been approached by many people, including news reporters from the biggest, from the mainstream, who've kind of hinted, William, you know, you better keep quiet about this because you don't know who you're dealing with.
[00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:42.519]  And William told me, and I'm sure he'll tell you the same thing, that he's never varied his story from day one, when the plane hit.
[00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:46.439]  And he looks them in the eye and says, you know, I have nothing to lose.
[00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:49.060]  I should probably be dead now.
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.880]  And I am now the voice of 200 of my friends who died.
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.361]  And all I want to do is get the truth out.
[00:05:55.361 --> 00:05:59.242]  Well, William has not been able to do that here in America.
[00:06:00.325 --> 00:06:02.928]  And I can tell you exactly what happened.
[00:06:02.928 --> 00:06:04.489]  Well, I'll tell you a story.
[00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:18.443]  Lou Cacioli, a 50-plus-year-old senior firefighter, head of a whole ladder, he told People Magazine that clearly bombs were going off when he was trapped in there before they collapsed.
[00:06:18.443 --> 00:06:21.346]  And then I called, talked to his wife, briefly talked to him, and he just said,
[00:06:22.193 --> 00:06:23.313]  I've been told to shut up.
[00:06:23.313 --> 00:06:24.374]  I'm not doing interviews.
[00:06:24.374 --> 00:06:25.134]  Exactly.
[00:06:25.134 --> 00:06:26.354]  So it's the same M.O.
[00:06:26.354 --> 00:06:27.155]  over and over again.
[00:06:27.155 --> 00:06:30.236]  Oh yeah, but listen, let me just talk specifically about Rodriguez.
[00:06:30.236 --> 00:06:31.076]  Now let's talk about his story.
[00:06:31.076 --> 00:06:32.556]  He's coming on in 20 minutes.
[00:06:32.556 --> 00:06:33.617]  What's that?
[00:06:33.617 --> 00:06:37.138]  Of course, Mr. Rodriguez will be joining us in 20 minutes, but tell us his story.
[00:06:37.138 --> 00:06:41.719]  Yeah, you know, I'll tell you, and he can talk about it also.
[00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:43.780]  But let me tell you how I heard about William.
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.641]  He's a lead plaintiff in a RICO lawsuit filed in Philadelphia last November.
[00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:51.102]  That's by Attorney Phil Berg.
[00:06:52.024 --> 00:06:54.966]  Recently, the case, the government made a motion to dismiss.
[00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:56.987]  The judge ruled against the government.
[00:06:56.987 --> 00:06:59.849]  The case is now being moved to New York, a change of venue.
[00:06:59.849 --> 00:07:01.489]  And the case goes on, a legal discovery.
[00:07:01.489 --> 00:07:07.413]  Well, William, I've written about, I've talked to Phil about William since last November when the lawsuit hit.
[00:07:07.413 --> 00:07:11.775]  And I never really pushed the subject of really forcing William to go forward.
[00:07:11.775 --> 00:07:14.617]  He spends a lot of time in Europe getting his story across.
[00:07:15.257 --> 00:07:23.199]  And so I just let the story progress, and in several stories of mine, you'll see I refer to William's name and the comments he made to Phil.
[00:07:23.199 --> 00:07:31.061]  However, in a recent story I ran, William contacted me and asked me if I'd like to speak about it.
[00:07:31.061 --> 00:07:33.141]  And I asked him, you know, can I talk to you?
[00:07:33.141 --> 00:07:35.682]  So we began speaking on the phone.
[00:07:35.682 --> 00:07:40.803]  And what came of this to me, when I got off the phone, I said, my God, why would
[00:07:42.319 --> 00:07:43.520]  NBC News.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:45.341]  Why would all these other news agencies?
[00:07:45.341 --> 00:07:46.602]  This isn't a news story.
[00:07:46.602 --> 00:07:53.487]  I mean, if you're a journalist, three years ago, trying to get this story out, you're not going out on a journalistic limb.
[00:07:53.487 --> 00:07:55.369]  Because let me tell you why.
[00:07:55.369 --> 00:08:00.192]  William, I thought maybe William just heard explosions, but William came to work late.
[00:08:00.192 --> 00:08:04.976]  He goes down into his base, instead of being up above where he'd normally be, he came to work late.
[00:08:04.976 --> 00:08:08.338]  He was down below in sub-level one in an office with 14 people.
[00:08:10.649 --> 00:08:21.199]  Now, when the bomb went off under his feet, he said he felt the floor shaking, the walls around him cracking, and, of course, all these 14 people were frightened.
[00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:24.502]  Seconds later, he hears an explosion from way above.
[00:08:24.502 --> 00:08:26.984]  Not knowing it's an airplane, he doesn't know what it is.
[00:08:26.984 --> 00:08:35.292]  However, immediately after that, a man by the name of Felipe David comes running in, burnt to a crisp.
[00:08:36.466 --> 00:08:43.930]  Uh, skin hanging from his arms and his hands, his face completely burnt, screaming, explosion, explosion, explosion.
[00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:51.953]  So, for those that don't understand, there's an explosion, uh, right before, is what I'm getting, uh, right before the plane even hits.
[00:08:51.953 --> 00:08:53.054]  They're down in the basement.
[00:08:53.054 --> 00:08:54.455]  Right, they hear that explosion from below.
[00:08:54.455 --> 00:09:01.198]  Totally, totally far away from where any, uh, any fire or the plane hitting, you know, 70-something stories up could hurt them.
[00:09:01.198 --> 00:09:01.818]  Impossible.
[00:09:01.818 --> 00:09:03.599]  So, this guy's got skin hanging off, uh,
[00:09:04.139 --> 00:09:05.139]  He's been in an explosion.
[00:09:05.139 --> 00:09:07.140]  Well, let me tell you where David was at.
[00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:23.127]  David was at an elevator shaft, a freight elevator shaft, about three or four hundred feet away, and as the flames came shooting up and burnt him to a crisp, he runs to the nearest office, and fourteen people witnessed this.
[00:09:24.042 --> 00:09:27.243]  Witness Rod, you know, Rodriguez, then takes him out.
[00:09:27.243 --> 00:09:29.344]  Where is the fellow you just mentioned?
[00:09:29.344 --> 00:09:34.867]  Well, here's the story, and this is what William says, and let me get, you know, I'll explain this really quickly.
[00:09:34.867 --> 00:09:37.948]  Right after, right after 9-11, a lot of stories appeared.
[00:09:37.948 --> 00:09:46.552]  A couple of comments, William's story, I think, got in some places just quickly, but see what happened was, everything was forgotten about that.
[00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:48.773]  A lot of these people who were talking then,
[00:09:49.935 --> 00:09:51.855]  Three years later are difficult to find.
[00:09:51.855 --> 00:09:57.077]  I have a bunch of phone numbers and most of the numbers are disconnected from the people.
[00:09:57.077 --> 00:10:02.898]  It's going to take a big, you know, it's going to take getting out there and finding them and William has trouble finding some of them.
[00:10:02.898 --> 00:10:05.419]  Right after 9-11, I called quite a few of these people.
[00:10:05.419 --> 00:10:11.360]  I probably got a hold of about five different people, two of them firefighters, and they just said, look, we've been told to shut up.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.400]  That was universal.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.301]  Exactly.
[00:10:13.301 --> 00:10:19.562]  And you know, during that time, there was a different atmosphere and the atmosphere basically... Worship the government, believe the story.
[00:10:20.142 --> 00:10:21.163]  Sure.
[00:10:21.163 --> 00:10:22.824]  Nobody knew.
[00:10:22.824 --> 00:10:25.366]  But years later, what happened, though, is interesting.
[00:10:25.366 --> 00:10:32.631]  As we move this story along, which never really gets covered thoroughly in the press, we get to the 9-11 Commission.
[00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:41.337]  Now, as you know, the 9-11 Commission has ignored many people's comments, many even of the victims and the people involved, when they come to their scientific conclusions.
[00:10:41.337 --> 00:10:43.819]  And I put that word, scientific conclusions, in quotes.
[00:10:44.904 --> 00:10:55.723]  Because what there basically happened here, Rodriguez also was very forthright and wanted to talk to the 9-11 Commission, wanted to talk to the FBI, wanted and he'll explain this.
[00:10:55.723 --> 00:10:57.746]  Well anyway, I believe the 9-11 Commission
[00:10:59.349 --> 00:11:12.800]  I've talked to other people who, for example, have found the black boxes, things like that, that were totally ignored, but I think because of Rodriguez's position, because of what he did on 9-11, because of the corroboration of 14 people with him, they had to deal with him somehow.
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.763]  So they pulled him in and said, we'll talk to you, but behind closed doors.
[00:11:16.763 --> 00:11:19.825]  So Rodriguez was kind of intimidated to keep quiet.
[00:11:19.825 --> 00:11:25.690]  Well, anyway, at the time, NBC News got wind of this, and also CNN, which I just found out.
[00:11:26.764 --> 00:11:35.029]  And they sent a news crew, and I've got email verifications of this, a news crew, out to his house for a complete day, right after these 9-11 hearings.
[00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:41.233]  Now, Rodriguez is kind of quiet, says a few things to a paper, but doesn't get into his story, because I think what happened, and you can verify this with him,
[00:11:42.431 --> 00:12:01.592]  uh... they were telling him to keep quiet uh... we need to talk and discuss this and get but basically nine eleven commission never uses uh... uh... words to justified as a classic they go this is national security we're gonna use this but keep quiet for a few right well anyway the real key to this thing comes nbc news gets wind of it
[00:12:02.132 --> 00:12:07.255]  And they send a crew out all day, and they sit with Rodriguez, uh, William, the whole day.
[00:12:07.255 --> 00:12:09.257]  They tape him for a complete day.
[00:12:09.257 --> 00:12:22.365]  All his, everything he said to me, everything he's, uh, uh, said to other people, like, uh, overseas in Puerto Rico and Telemundo and all these, uh, overseas, uh, uh, news broadcasts that are covering his story and, and let him talk uncensored.
[00:12:22.365 --> 00:12:29.309]  Well, anyway, they, they, they get all this tape and all his words, but they take it back and write, not a word of it ever appears.
[00:12:29.309 --> 00:12:30.150]  Okay?
[00:12:31.758 --> 00:12:39.163]  Same thing supposedly happens with CNN, and I got a couple emails from the CNN crew that supposedly were supposed to come out and see him.
[00:12:39.163 --> 00:12:44.267]  However, what happens is that they come out and they get all the information, but never run it.
[00:12:44.267 --> 00:12:55.815]  And I say to them, and I bluntly, as a journalist and as a person who basically looks at things from a journalistic point of view, if I was an editor or whatever,
[00:12:56.528 --> 00:13:00.930]  I'm not going out on a journalistic limb, perhaps if Rodriguez is the only one that hears that.
[00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.011]  I want some verification.
[00:13:02.011 --> 00:13:04.212]  Well, he's got collaboration of 14 people.
[00:13:04.212 --> 00:13:05.292]  Names.
[00:13:05.292 --> 00:13:05.732]  Exactly.
[00:13:05.732 --> 00:13:12.055]  We're going to be talking with him and I want to hold you over when Mr. Rodriguez is on with us, but I also want to add this right now.
[00:13:12.055 --> 00:13:14.496]  It wasn't a journalistic limb, Alex, is what I'm saying.
[00:13:14.496 --> 00:13:15.537]  No, I understand it wasn't.
[00:13:15.537 --> 00:13:19.238]  We have all these other witnesses, but let me just add this.
[00:13:19.238 --> 00:13:20.799]  Before we go to break, this is very important.
[00:13:22.296 --> 00:13:28.524]  Don't forget about the three data recorders and the firemen and the rescue workers.
[00:13:28.524 --> 00:13:31.027]  And that was in the Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:13:31.027 --> 00:13:35.273]  But again, it's still a news blackout other than the Philadelphia Daily News, this show, and your columns.
[00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:36.114]  We'll be right back.
[00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:42.533]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:13:42.533 --> 00:13:47.116]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:13:47.116 --> 00:13:51.519]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:13:51.519 --> 00:13:52.860]  The New World Order.
[00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:58.947]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:13:58.947 --> 00:14:06.009]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:14:06.009 --> 00:14:08.370]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:18.693]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:14:18.993 --> 00:14:24.858]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[00:14:37.606 --> 00:14:41.708]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:14:41.708 --> 00:14:47.431]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:14:47.431 --> 00:14:57.976]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:14:57.976 --> 00:15:02.298]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:15:02.398 --> 00:15:03.298]  We're good to go.
[00:15:17.603 --> 00:15:22.286]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:15:22.286 --> 00:15:26.769]  Normally $48 each, get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[00:15:26.769 --> 00:15:31.352]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:15:31.352 --> 00:15:31.792]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:15:37.444 --> 00:15:41.288]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:15:41.288 --> 00:15:42.449]  Look no further!
[00:15:42.449 --> 00:15:45.452]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:15:45.452 --> 00:15:53.880]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:54.680]  I think so.
[00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:11.970]  I don't know.
[00:16:45.609 --> 00:16:47.150]  Look, I know we got loaded phone lines.
[00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:53.634]  I haven't given the phone number up yet today because we're not taking calls yet.
[00:16:53.634 --> 00:16:58.057]  We will do that sometime in the next hour.
[00:16:58.057 --> 00:16:59.638]  We've got to cover this information.
[00:16:59.638 --> 00:17:01.299]  It's so important.
[00:17:01.299 --> 00:17:10.965]  We're talking to, of course, a writer for American Free Press and a lot of other publications, Greg Zemanski, about all the major news that's coming out about 9-11.
[00:17:10.965 --> 00:17:12.926]  More and more whistleblowers going public.
[00:17:14.093 --> 00:17:16.696]  More and more insiders going public.
[00:17:16.696 --> 00:17:20.381]  More and more people who witness what happened on 9-11 going public.
[00:17:20.381 --> 00:17:22.103]  Rescue workers.
[00:17:22.103 --> 00:17:26.089]  Greg, have you seen the David Shaler MI5 article we just put out today?
[00:17:26.089 --> 00:17:26.890]  You know something?
[00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:29.533]  I'll be honest with you, I glanced at it.
[00:17:29.533 --> 00:17:31.216]  And I did not get a good read yet.
[00:17:32.488 --> 00:17:37.174]  I mean, here's a guy who was with MI5 talking about the British being involved in terrorism over there.
[00:17:37.174 --> 00:17:45.082]  He's looking as a counter-terrorism specialist who worked on terrorism in that area of the MI5 at 9-11.
[00:17:45.082 --> 00:17:47.525]  He's saying it's obviously an inside job as well.
[00:17:47.525 --> 00:17:50.728]  That's an explosive story, Alex, and I'll make sure I get and read it.
[00:17:50.728 --> 00:17:52.050]  It sounds very interesting.
[00:17:52.825 --> 00:17:54.085]  Well, I hope you do some work with it.
[00:17:54.085 --> 00:17:56.486]  Yeah, I'm going to take a look at it.
[00:17:56.486 --> 00:18:00.407]  I know I fought and I didn't have time this morning to get at it.
[00:18:00.407 --> 00:18:08.990]  Well, getting back to Mr. Rodriguez, he's got 14 witnesses and you've got the explosion and the fire shooting up.
[00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:15.132]  Well, if I could just say something kind of in general on a story like this and why I believe it's important.
[00:18:15.892 --> 00:18:32.304]  As you know, if you just isolate the incident of how, let's say, the North Tower went down, you're hearing all these stories about the scientific explanations from the government's point of view, the scientific explanations from the conspiracy theorists' point of view.
[00:18:32.304 --> 00:18:36.147]  And if you imagine yourself in a court of law right now listening to that,
[00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:39.149]  You take the next step and you bring up a witness.
[00:18:39.149 --> 00:18:41.111]  You bring up a witness like Mr. Rodriguez.
[00:18:41.111 --> 00:18:45.914]  Now as you know, eyewitness testimony can be very reliable.
[00:18:45.914 --> 00:18:49.277]  It can be very unreliable.
[00:18:49.277 --> 00:18:52.960]  And that's basically since, if you line up ten people and you look at a murder,
[00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.291]  You're going to get maybe ten different accounts.
[00:18:55.291 --> 00:18:56.472]  People see different things.
[00:18:56.472 --> 00:19:08.642]  However, when eyewitness testimony is the most valuable, and more credible than scientific explanations, is when it can be corroborated, and corroborated with documentation.
[00:19:08.642 --> 00:19:11.484]  And that's exactly what Rodriguez's story is.
[00:19:11.484 --> 00:19:18.689]  So basically, if you're a jury listening to, well, did it fall down by explosives, or did it fall down by the airplanes up there?
[00:19:21.091 --> 00:19:27.198]  Rodriguez's testimony, collaborated by 14 other people, is going to sway the jury to the other, to the side of the demolition, of course.
[00:19:27.198 --> 00:19:36.408]  Because, basically, you look at what he saw, how 14 people see a burning man coming from, you know, within seconds, from below.
[00:19:37.555 --> 00:19:38.596]  How could it be?
[00:19:38.596 --> 00:19:40.096]  Understand, they're in the basement.
[00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:41.297]  They're in the basement complex.
[00:19:41.297 --> 00:19:41.837]  What?
[00:19:41.837 --> 00:19:43.578]  Four floors beneath the ground?
[00:19:43.578 --> 00:19:46.620]  So I would guess they were in the first... I think he said sub-level one.
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:48.961]  So that would be the first basement level.
[00:19:48.961 --> 00:19:50.282]  So there's several other basement levels?
[00:19:50.282 --> 00:19:50.902]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:50.902 --> 00:19:54.704]  And then somebody... Did this fellow come running from their level or from another level?
[00:19:54.704 --> 00:19:56.445]  His level.
[00:19:56.445 --> 00:19:58.406]  He was only 300 feet away from the office.
[00:19:58.406 --> 00:20:01.788]  And he reported that fire shot up out of it.
[00:20:01.788 --> 00:20:05.130]  Yeah, fire shot through that... through the elevator shaft.
[00:20:06.224 --> 00:20:08.606]  It could not have shot down that quickly.
[00:20:08.606 --> 00:20:11.529]  Well, they admit that fire didn't shoot down even to like the 50th floor.
[00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:12.189]  It was all going on up top.
[00:20:12.189 --> 00:20:15.973]  Yeah, I mean, there were people using those elevators up until... I mean, they couldn't have shot down that quickly.
[00:20:15.973 --> 00:20:17.294]  Yeah, they were using the elevators.
[00:20:17.294 --> 00:20:18.275]  So, wow.
[00:20:18.275 --> 00:20:19.316]  Within the time span.
[00:20:19.316 --> 00:20:21.398]  And which particular tower was he in?
[00:20:21.398 --> 00:20:22.138]  North.
[00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:23.320]  Yeah.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.441]  Unbelievable.
[00:20:24.441 --> 00:20:29.525]  And now we have CNN and NBC going and interviewing him, but not reporting on him.
[00:20:29.525 --> 00:20:30.446]  Yeah, I mean, come on.
[00:20:30.446 --> 00:20:31.547]  I mean, look at...
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:41.270]  The journalist that, you know, I want to know, I'd like to hear that conversation when they decided not to run this or decided not to use the resources to find these other people and verify that.
[00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:43.713]  I mean, here's a guy burnt to crisp in a hospital.
[00:20:44.839 --> 00:20:46.541]  And, you know, they're ignoring it.
[00:20:46.541 --> 00:20:52.707]  And now, years later, basically, it's kind of, they're hoping that, you know, it's just forgotten about.
[00:20:52.707 --> 00:20:58.513]  And, you know, hopefully people will look at this and say, you know, if they're lying about this.
[00:20:58.513 --> 00:21:05.340]  And basically, I'm not saying, you know, even to a point where if they would have just investigated this in a forthright manner,
[00:21:07.214 --> 00:21:10.918]  However, do you think that investigation might have been contrary to the government's story?
[00:21:10.918 --> 00:21:12.159]  Maybe that's why they didn't do it.
[00:21:12.159 --> 00:21:14.562]  Alright, we're getting Mr. Rodriguez on the line right now.
[00:21:14.562 --> 00:21:17.765]  We'll be right back.
[00:21:17.765 --> 00:21:22.450]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:21:28.164 --> 00:21:31.485]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:21:31.485 --> 00:21:35.906]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:21:35.906 --> 00:21:38.887]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:21:38.887 --> 00:21:41.488]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:21:41.488 --> 00:21:50.330]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:51.851]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:21:51.851 --> 00:21:56.032]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:21:56.032 --> 00:21:57.213]  Not yet available?
[00:22:26.192 --> 00:22:31.014]  Big Brother.
[00:22:43.923 --> 00:22:45.705]  Mainstream media.
[00:22:45.705 --> 00:22:47.446]  Government cover-ups.
[00:22:47.446 --> 00:22:49.048]  You want answers?
[00:22:49.048 --> 00:22:50.589]  Well, so does he.
[00:22:50.589 --> 00:22:54.773]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:54.773 --> 00:23:08.846]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:23:08.846 --> 00:23:09.727]  Blasting out!
[00:23:10.786 --> 00:23:16.292]  Southern California to upstate New York from Austin, Texas to Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:23:16.292 --> 00:23:20.536]  Pensacola, Florida to Chicago, Illinois.
[00:23:20.536 --> 00:23:22.097]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:23:22.097 --> 00:23:23.699]  We're going to be here for another two hours.
[00:23:23.699 --> 00:23:26.141]  We're into hour number two.
[00:23:26.141 --> 00:23:27.242]  Coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:23:28.706 --> 00:23:36.572]  We have the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Ronald Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts, who doubts the official 9-11 story going public.
[00:23:36.572 --> 00:23:41.236]  We, of course, have broken the news that former MI5 agents has 9-11 an inside job.
[00:23:41.236 --> 00:23:42.377]  Attack was coup d'etat.
[00:23:42.377 --> 00:23:44.738]  Buildings were demolished by controlled demolitions.
[00:23:44.738 --> 00:23:46.680]  David Shaler, who worked terrorism,
[00:23:48.187 --> 00:24:02.993]  And award-winning researcher and author Greg Zemanski is also riding shotgun with us, breaking and magnifying so many of these articles, including 9-11 rescue workers finding three of the four data recorders and being told to shut up!
[00:24:02.993 --> 00:24:09.276]  And that's even made it, subsequently, into things like the Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:24:09.276 --> 00:24:11.297]  So this is CONFIRMED.
[00:24:11.297 --> 00:24:14.598]  There are lawsuits involving all of this.
[00:24:14.598 --> 00:24:16.319]  I'm extremely honored to
[00:24:18.208 --> 00:24:22.591]  We have on the line one of the survivors who was in the North Tower, William Rodriguez.
[00:24:22.591 --> 00:24:33.759]  We talked about his story in the last 30 minutes, how they witnessed explosions down in their basement level, and it burning and hurting people, the fire coming up, not down.
[00:24:33.759 --> 00:24:37.222]  And he helped a lot of folks, of course, get out of there, barely survived himself.
[00:24:37.222 --> 00:24:41.324]  And we're honored to have William Rodriguez on with us.
[00:24:41.324 --> 00:24:42.025]  William, welcome.
[00:24:43.038 --> 00:24:43.899]  My pleasure.
[00:24:43.899 --> 00:24:45.099]  Thank you for inviting me.
[00:24:45.099 --> 00:24:46.560]  It's an honor for me to be here.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:51.042]  Well, it's great to be here, and we've got Greg Riding Shotgun with us, so we'll be popping in and out with him.
[00:24:51.042 --> 00:24:59.006]  We're about to break here in a moment, but I want to... I want to first just talk about who you are, why you were working there, and then when we get back, I want to tell the story.
[00:24:59.006 --> 00:25:05.309]  I want to go back to those first minutes and give you the floor and just let you tell us exactly, in your words, what happened.
[00:25:05.309 --> 00:25:08.691]  But first off, tell us about yourself, Mr. Rodriguez, and why you're going public.
[00:25:09.477 --> 00:25:11.238]  Yes, my name is William Rodriguez.
[00:25:11.238 --> 00:25:14.460]  I worked in the building for almost 20 years.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:25.885]  On September 11th, it would have been 20 years, and actually I was there as the person in charge of all the stairwells of the North Tower.
[00:25:25.885 --> 00:25:30.788]  I was the porter that had to do the maintenance of the whole building, of all the stairwells.
[00:25:30.788 --> 00:25:34.970]  The building has three staircases, A, B, and C, and I was the person in charge of it.
[00:25:36.599 --> 00:25:39.101]  And you've been there 20 years as of September 11, 2001.
[00:25:39.101 --> 00:25:41.684]  That is correct.
[00:25:41.684 --> 00:25:48.470]  And like I said, I have a personal view of exactly what happened on September 11.
[00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:54.595]  Not only was I there, but I'm actually the last survivor from the North Tower that was pulled from the rubble.
[00:25:54.595 --> 00:25:56.197]  I actually survived under the rubble.
[00:25:56.197 --> 00:25:59.300]  Now I remember that.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.562]  When did you start understanding the official story was a fraud?
[00:26:02.562 --> 00:26:02.983]  Day one?
[00:26:04.410 --> 00:26:20.702]  Well, I didn't know on day one, I'll be honest with you, because Alex, at the beginning, I came out of the news probably days or weeks because I came out with the story and I testified for the media, for national media, on that same day of what I experienced.
[00:26:20.702 --> 00:26:25.686]  And then I started to realize that my story was continuously being edited.
[00:26:25.686 --> 00:26:31.270]  That the whole information that I was given, that I was given, wasn't coming out correctly.
[00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.471]  That's absolutely key!
[00:26:33.334 --> 00:26:35.576]  Yeah, that was actually tidbits here and there.
[00:26:35.576 --> 00:26:40.299]  So regardless of who you talked to, they were editing key parts up?
[00:26:40.299 --> 00:26:41.179]  That is correct.
[00:26:41.179 --> 00:26:45.402]  That is correct, and it was a continuous effort from all the medias.
[00:26:45.402 --> 00:26:51.226]  I actually interviewed hundreds and hundreds of hours from September 11th until today.
[00:26:51.226 --> 00:27:00.031]  I mean, I have a whole library of interviews, and it's incredible because I have some raw copies of some of the interviews that I actually performed.
[00:27:00.031 --> 00:27:00.632]  Unbelievable!
[00:27:01.452 --> 00:27:02.212]  And he's unbelievable!
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.901]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.

[00:29:02.164 --> 00:29:06.327]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:29:06.327 --> 00:29:07.568]  Read the labels.
[00:29:07.568 --> 00:29:11.912]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:29:11.912 --> 00:29:16.476]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:29:16.476 --> 00:29:21.341]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[00:30:02.423 --> 00:30:09.024]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:09.024 --> 00:30:11.404]  We're talking to an individual who's quite famous.
[00:30:11.404 --> 00:30:15.445]  He was the last person living to be pulled from the wreckage.
[00:30:16.617 --> 00:30:22.862]  WTC Basement Blast and Injured Burn Victim Blows Official 9-11 Story Sky High.
[00:30:22.862 --> 00:30:24.444]  He's William Rodriguez.
[00:30:24.444 --> 00:30:30.769]  And the key here is, is I remember getting inklings of his story, and many others who saw the same thing, on 9-11.
[00:30:30.769 --> 00:30:36.794]  But every time he talked to a major TV network or station, they would put him on the news but edit out.
[00:30:38.217 --> 00:30:45.566]  How he talked about the explosions down in the base of the building, which firefighters and others said they also heard, witnessed, and saw.
[00:30:45.566 --> 00:30:49.030]  Even reporters were saying it as it happened on a few of the news channels.
[00:30:49.030 --> 00:30:51.052]  So, they didn't want that out there.
[00:30:51.923 --> 00:31:03.208]  And remember, they ordered the FAA tape shredded, they ordered the people on the ground that found three of the flight data recorders, you know, highly decorated rescue workers, keep your mouth shut, you know, when they found these recorders, clearly marked.
[00:31:03.208 --> 00:31:10.251]  Just the continual hauling away the rubble under national security to China, despite the fact the family tried to stop it.
[00:31:10.251 --> 00:31:15.714]  He was the head of maintenance for the three major stairwells for the entire building.
[00:31:15.714 --> 00:31:20.416]  Been there 20 years, a senior member of maintenance.
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:23.843]  And, you know, keeping all of that in place.
[00:31:23.843 --> 00:31:27.668]  And so joining us again is William Rodriguez.
[00:31:27.668 --> 00:31:32.073]  And just recapping what he said in the last segment for stations that don't carry that first segment.
[00:31:32.073 --> 00:31:33.896]  William, now, let's just go through the story.
[00:31:33.896 --> 00:31:36.198]  That morning, what you were doing, what happened.
[00:31:36.198 --> 00:31:37.240]  Please describe it for us.
[00:31:38.428 --> 00:31:41.870]  I usually get to work at 8 o'clock in the morning.
[00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:45.771]  That day, as a miracle, I went in late at 8.30.
[00:31:45.771 --> 00:31:48.452]  I called the office and I said I was going to be a little late.
[00:31:48.452 --> 00:31:54.015]  And they said, well, you have to get here because we don't have anybody to take your position doing the stairwells.
[00:31:54.015 --> 00:31:55.496]  So I got there at 8.30.
[00:31:55.496 --> 00:32:00.978]  I say it's a miracle because I would have been at the top of the building when the plane hit.
[00:32:00.978 --> 00:32:04.780]  The reason is because I started cleaning the stairwells from the top down.
[00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:07.661]  And actually, I will have breakfast every morning at Windows of the World.
[00:32:09.446 --> 00:32:09.866]  I don't know.
[00:32:34.036 --> 00:32:38.839]  That moment that it was an electrical generator that just blew up on their sub-levels.
[00:32:38.839 --> 00:32:41.920]  And when I say sub-levels, it's because I was located on B1.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:46.623]  That's basement number one, and the building has six sub-levels, all the way down to B6.
[00:32:46.623 --> 00:32:51.085]  So I felt this huge explosion, and at that moment I was going to verbalize it.
[00:32:51.085 --> 00:32:54.687]  I was going to say, uh, it's one of the electrical generators that just blew up.
[00:32:55.257 --> 00:33:00.122]  And when I was going to verbalize it, is when I heard the impact at the top of the building.
[00:33:00.122 --> 00:33:08.689]  And it sounded pretty far away, and it was so hard that the walls shaked and broke.
[00:33:08.689 --> 00:33:14.595]  They cracked all over, and the false ceiling just collapsed, and the sprinkler system got activated.
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:16.661]  And everybody started screaming.
[00:33:16.661 --> 00:33:19.002]  There was like 14 people inside the office.
[00:33:19.002 --> 00:33:21.543]  And at that moment, we don't know what's happening.
[00:33:21.543 --> 00:33:24.624]  We thought, again, it's an explosion at the sub-level.
[00:33:24.624 --> 00:33:34.368]  And when I was going to pick up the phone to call the emergency, there's a guy coming running into the office saying, explosion, explosion, explosion.
[00:33:34.368 --> 00:33:35.989]  And this guy was a black guy.
[00:33:35.989 --> 00:33:38.330]  He has his hands extended.
[00:33:39.017 --> 00:33:47.285]  And all the skin from under his armpit was pulled on both arms all the way to the fingertips, and it was hanging like a piece of cloth.
[00:33:47.285 --> 00:33:52.110]  And actually, I thought it was clothing while he was hanging, and then I realized it was his skin.
[00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:57.895]  He was standing in front of a freight elevator at the basement when he was actually burned.
[00:33:57.895 --> 00:33:58.856]  Now, this is the basement.
[00:33:58.856 --> 00:34:01.138]  This is not the top of the building.
[00:34:01.138 --> 00:34:02.439]  And I said, what happened?
[00:34:02.439 --> 00:34:04.081]  And he said, the elevators, the elevators.
[00:34:04.961 --> 00:34:10.188]  And I went to pick up the phone to call the EMS that was located on Building 2.
[00:34:10.188 --> 00:34:12.992]  Building 1 and Building 2 connected through the basement.
[00:34:12.992 --> 00:34:15.796]  And when I say Building 2, it's the South Tower.
[00:34:17.794 --> 00:34:21.636]  So I went to pick up the phone and at that moment we heard another explosion.
[00:34:21.636 --> 00:34:25.138]  And the floor shakes so much it was like an earthquake.
[00:34:25.138 --> 00:34:28.960]  And at that moment I was thinking that it was probably an earthquake.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:33.062]  I was telling everybody to get under the door frames because the floor was moving.
[00:34:33.062 --> 00:34:34.723]  And then I realized, what am I talking about?
[00:34:34.723 --> 00:34:36.324]  This is an explosion what I'm hearing.
[00:34:36.804 --> 00:34:37.444]  Everybody out!
[00:34:37.444 --> 00:34:38.045]  Everybody out!
[00:34:38.045 --> 00:34:39.705]  I started pushing everybody out of the office.
[00:34:39.705 --> 00:34:42.006]  I take the guy, the black guy that was burned.
[00:34:42.006 --> 00:34:44.147]  The name of the guy is Felipe David.
[00:34:44.147 --> 00:34:47.469]  He's a guy from Honduras, which I did not know.
[00:34:47.469 --> 00:34:52.971]  He worked for Aramac, the company that does supplies for all the vending machines.
[00:34:52.971 --> 00:34:58.573]  And I put his arm around my shoulder and I started helping him out out of the building.
[00:34:58.573 --> 00:35:02.055]  Now, the way to get out was through the loading dock.
[00:35:02.055 --> 00:35:04.096]  And it was pretty far.
[00:35:04.096 --> 00:35:05.036]  I mean, we're talking about
[00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:11.354]  Uh, well, uh, like 600 or 800 feet away.
[00:35:11.354 --> 00:35:15.237]  And once I get out with all these people, I see an ambulance.
[00:35:15.237 --> 00:35:16.097]  I stop the ambulance.
[00:35:16.097 --> 00:35:18.259]  I put Mr. Felipe David inside the ambulance.
[00:35:19.046 --> 00:35:22.407]  And that's when I hear, a plane hit the building, a plane hit the building.
[00:35:22.407 --> 00:35:32.870]  I turned around, I look up, I see the hole, I see the fire, I see the debris falling apart, and all of a sudden I go into a frenzy because I started thinking about the people from Windows of the World.
[00:35:32.870 --> 00:35:35.691]  I said, we gotta go back, we gotta go back, we gotta go back.
[00:35:35.691 --> 00:35:41.833]  And the same people that I just pulled from the basement, they started screaming at me, Rodriguez, you're not going back in there, you stay here.
[00:35:41.833 --> 00:35:45.154]  Even my supervisor that I just pulled out.
[00:35:45.154 --> 00:35:46.674]  But I said, no, no, we gotta go back.
[00:35:47.305 --> 00:35:47.745]  I don't think so.
[00:36:01.852 --> 00:36:03.953]  Let me just stop you for a second, Mr. Rodriguez.
[00:36:03.953 --> 00:36:05.494]  Before you get to the Operational Center,
[00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:45.253]  Being there in the first bombing, knowing what it feels like, and then experiencing the individual running in and saying the fire came up, I want to get into some detail about what Mr. David said to you on that.
[00:36:45.253 --> 00:36:56.017]  And then I also want to ask you the question, were you looking for truck bombs because you were putting two and two together in the back of your brain from hearing and feeling that explosion?
[00:36:57.046 --> 00:36:58.466]  And because of the experience of 1993.
[00:36:58.466 --> 00:37:09.088]  Now remember, being there, the actual expectation of something happening in the building was a constant.
[00:37:09.088 --> 00:37:18.130]  The employees, we always talk about it in a weekly basis because we said, this is a job that was never finished.
[00:37:18.130 --> 00:37:19.730]  They're going to try it again.
[00:37:19.730 --> 00:37:26.171]  So we continued having these kind of conversations on a weekly basis so we were aware
[00:37:27.274 --> 00:37:30.898]  By osmosis of everything that was happening around.
[00:37:30.898 --> 00:37:43.471]  And I will bring you to that point, that experience later on, because when I testified to the 9-11 Commission, I did give them some details that miraculously didn't show up on the final report.
[00:37:43.471 --> 00:37:49.357]  Yeah, let's talk about that, but I interrupted you at the point you got to the Emergency Operations Center.
[00:37:50.023 --> 00:37:55.547]  Yeah, the Operation Control Center was actually a center that was created after 1993, Bombi.
[00:37:55.547 --> 00:38:03.793]  The World Trade Center, they spent $136 million to upgrade the whole security in the building.
[00:38:03.793 --> 00:38:07.556]  A quarter of a billion, actually, but $136 was just for security.
[00:38:07.556 --> 00:38:14.041]  They created this center, and stupidly enough, they put it inside the building, which made sense to have it outside the building.
[00:38:14.785 --> 00:38:15.846]  I don't think so.
[00:38:31.149 --> 00:38:32.690]  And I said, Jimmy, you gotta get out of here.
[00:38:32.690 --> 00:38:35.711]  He didn't even know that the building got hit.
[00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:46.474]  He was on the sub-levels of the South Tower, and that gives you a general idea of how many people probably died on the South Tower without ever knowing what was happening.
[00:38:46.474 --> 00:38:49.075]  And he said, you gotta get out, you gotta get out, a plane hit the building.
[00:38:49.075 --> 00:38:50.295]  He couldn't believe it.
[00:38:50.295 --> 00:38:57.818]  And there was a lady from the Marriott Hotel Security, the one that checks every employee, she's there trembling.
[00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:00.211]  Because she was a new employee.
[00:39:00.211 --> 00:39:02.913]  She didn't know what was happening.
[00:39:02.913 --> 00:39:04.154]  I said, you gotta get out of here.
[00:39:04.154 --> 00:39:07.957]  And she was afraid of leaving her post because she didn't want to get fired.
[00:39:07.957 --> 00:39:09.218]  I said, no, you gotta get out.
[00:39:09.218 --> 00:39:17.203]  What about the reports that up high in the towers there was some type of speaker system telling people to stay at their post?
[00:39:17.203 --> 00:39:18.404]  That was Lloyd Thompson.
[00:39:18.404 --> 00:39:23.788]  It was a guy that disappeared for three years and he testified
[00:39:24.244 --> 00:39:31.428]  On the last week of the hearings for the 9-11 Commission, and they said that they couldn't find him.
[00:39:31.428 --> 00:39:39.211]  And it's the funniest thing, because I have Lloyd on my organization from day one, and I could have supplied him very easily.
[00:39:39.211 --> 00:39:41.132]  It's something that is mind-boggling.
[00:39:41.132 --> 00:39:46.235]  Okay, well then tell us, who was on the speakers saying, stay in your post?
[00:39:46.235 --> 00:39:48.736]  Actually, it wasn't that staying in the post.
[00:39:48.736 --> 00:39:52.158]  It was actually saying that people were coming down,
[00:39:52.854 --> 00:39:53.314]  I think so.
[00:40:15.737 --> 00:40:20.423]  The amount of automatic recordings that they have in the building.
[00:40:20.423 --> 00:40:22.606]  Now, not every floor worked.
[00:40:22.606 --> 00:40:25.249]  Not every floor had the speaker system activated.
[00:40:25.249 --> 00:40:29.715]  Well, that's a major mystery then, at least partially solved.
[00:40:29.715 --> 00:40:30.355]  Amazing.
[00:40:30.355 --> 00:40:32.218]  Let's bring in Greg Zemensky.
[00:40:32.938 --> 00:40:35.721]  Greg, there's so many points here.
[00:40:35.721 --> 00:40:38.983]  Should we get more into his eyewitness account?
[00:40:38.983 --> 00:40:46.690]  Or should we get into how the media tried to cover up and edit every time they interviewed Mr. Rodriguez, one of the heroes of 9-11, Greg?
[00:40:46.690 --> 00:40:54.356]  Well, I think you have to stick with his eyewitness account and those 14 people and maybe what happened to them.
[00:40:55.234 --> 00:41:04.099]  And then it very well flows into the fact that the media had all this stuff and why didn't they at least tell their story?
[00:41:04.099 --> 00:41:06.680]  They're not going out on a journalistic limb here.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.180]  Exactly.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:11.342]  Were you guys, I mean I've talked to a lot of firefighters, other people who were told to shut up.
[00:41:11.342 --> 00:41:14.544]  Were you told ever directly or do you know people who were told to shut up?
[00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:19.313]  Well, indirectly, they told me not to touch several subjects.
[00:41:19.313 --> 00:41:24.457]  They would say, you know, stick to this, what we're talking about, don't talk about other things, and it didn't make any sense, right?
[00:41:24.457 --> 00:41:29.861]  So I always maintained my story from the day that I was pulled from the rubble.
[00:41:29.861 --> 00:41:34.264]  Listen, I showed up on CNN on that day, okay?
[00:41:34.264 --> 00:41:38.428]  And if you can get the transcript, because I have been unsuccessful, but I... No, I remember.
[00:41:39.622 --> 00:41:41.984]  But luckily, I have a copy.
[00:41:41.984 --> 00:41:46.368]  And my story now is exactly the same one that I gave on that day.
[00:41:46.368 --> 00:41:47.689]  Oh, I gotta have that tape.
[00:41:47.689 --> 00:41:48.890]  I gotta get that tape.
[00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:50.372]  Stay there, Mr. Rodriguez.
[00:41:50.372 --> 00:41:53.575]  We'll be right back with yourself and, of course, Greg.
[00:41:53.575 --> 00:42:01.121]  I'm Alex Jones, PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com.
[00:42:01.121 --> 00:42:01.722]  Hi, folks.
[00:42:01.722 --> 00:42:03.503]  Jack Browner here from Midas Resources.
[00:42:03.503 --> 00:42:04.805]  The real money, folks.
[00:42:08.061 --> 00:42:10.483]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:42:10.483 --> 00:42:11.403]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:42:11.403 --> 00:42:12.064]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:42:12.064 --> 00:42:12.464]  A 5% increase.
[00:42:12.464 --> 00:42:15.426]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:42:15.426 --> 00:42:17.668]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:42:29.326 --> 00:42:35.570]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:39.152]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:42:39.152 --> 00:42:46.857]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:42:46.857 --> 00:42:50.219]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[00:42:50.219 --> 00:42:53.581]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[00:42:53.581 --> 00:42:55.002]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:43:00.274 --> 00:43:09.599]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:43:09.599 --> 00:43:21.166]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:43:21.166 --> 00:43:25.989]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[00:43:26.209 --> 00:43:26.449]  I don't
[00:43:53.757 --> 00:44:02.743]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[00:44:02.743 --> 00:44:03.904]  Look no further!
[00:44:03.904 --> 00:44:06.906]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[00:44:06.906 --> 00:44:15.592]  Hundreds of titles from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:44:15.592 --> 00:44:17.193]  You can order everything you need on the web
[00:44:17.213 --> 00:44:17.673]  We're good to go.

[00:44:53.519 --> 00:44:54.360]  Box 281, Wildwood, PA 15091.
[00:44:59.202 --> 00:45:06.628]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:45:06.628 --> 00:45:12.472]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X nail gel.
[00:45:12.472 --> 00:45:22.420]  All Natural Non-X is a topical ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:25.341]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:45:25.341 --> 00:45:28.402]  I used to have yellow nails and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:45:28.402 --> 00:45:30.143]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:45:30.143 --> 00:45:33.104]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:45:33.104 --> 00:45:37.886]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:45:37.886 --> 00:45:39.967]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:45:39.967 --> 00:45:51.252]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com.
[00:45:52.212 --> 00:46:10.146]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals!
[00:46:10.146 --> 00:46:14.410]  Alright, approaching the halfway point in this broadcast, we're gonna meet Mr. Rodriguez.
[00:46:16.628 --> 00:46:17.069]  On with us.
[00:46:17.069 --> 00:46:18.611]  He's honored us by doing that.
[00:46:18.611 --> 00:46:19.713]  One of the heroes of 9-11.
[00:46:19.713 --> 00:46:22.077]  Helped save a lot of people and barely made it out himself.
[00:46:22.077 --> 00:46:23.459]  Last person to be pulled from the rubble.
[00:46:23.459 --> 00:46:32.112]  We're going to keep him on with us with Paul Craig Roberts, the former Assistant Secretary of Treasury under Ronald Reagan and his administration.
[00:46:33.519 --> 00:46:38.225]  And if Mr. Zemanski, Greg Zemanski, wants to stay with us, he's welcome to ride shotgun.
[00:46:38.225 --> 00:46:41.969]  We'll kind of have our own little roundtable discussion here.
[00:46:41.969 --> 00:46:49.578]  I was just talking to you, Mr. Rodriguez, William Rodriguez, during the break, and you talked about how
[00:46:51.383 --> 00:47:03.846]  You were telling me how you've just been on this European tour, I guess with Jimmy Walters, exposing all of this, and almost, you didn't say almost, you said everyone knew the truth, everyone you talked to in Europe never believed the story.
[00:47:03.846 --> 00:47:04.607]  Tell us about that.
[00:47:04.607 --> 00:47:06.027]  That's exciting.
[00:47:06.027 --> 00:47:07.547]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[00:47:07.547 --> 00:47:12.429]  Jimmy Walters put this nice mega tour through the whole Europe.
[00:47:12.429 --> 00:47:20.331]  We went to Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, Amsterdam, Madrid, every single country that we went to.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:27.284]  Not once we have a dissenting voice that the official story was a lie.
[00:47:27.284 --> 00:47:33.809]  They even have questions that, listen, we have unfiltered news here compared to the news that you were getting over there.
[00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:40.614]  Here we continue having interviews from the European media that was never shown on the American media.
[00:47:41.258 --> 00:47:42.459]  And why did that happen?
[00:47:42.459 --> 00:47:47.261]  I said, well, you know, at that moment is when we explained that it was a whole cover-up.
[00:47:47.261 --> 00:47:58.047]  Well, yeah, that shows control that day one they would put you on CNN as a hero and as a survivor, went back into the building, had it collapse on you, the last to be dug out alive.
[00:47:58.047 --> 00:47:59.608]  I mean, think of what a big story that is.
[00:47:59.608 --> 00:48:04.830]  I remember you were all over TV and they would edit out craftily any discussion of explosions.
[00:48:04.830 --> 00:48:09.493]  Greg, that really shows the premeditated nature, doesn't it, Greg?
[00:48:09.953 --> 00:48:12.415]  Well, yeah, I thought I chose the state of the media right now.
[00:48:12.415 --> 00:48:22.923]  You know, like it said, this is all our story, and William's story should be told, and the media has an obligation in a major story like that to get it right.
[00:48:22.923 --> 00:48:33.471]  And you can see from what William's saying, they basically had another agenda, and it's that agenda, along with the government agenda, that needs to be exposed.
[00:48:34.131 --> 00:48:36.852]  And that's basically what we're doing right now.
[00:48:36.852 --> 00:48:38.573]  Well, I want to go back specifically.
[00:48:38.573 --> 00:48:40.814]  I mean, understand we have an eyewitness here.
[00:48:40.814 --> 00:48:43.195]  We have these other 14 eyewitnesses.
[00:48:43.195 --> 00:48:49.178]  We have the individual, Mr. David, burned, saying fire shot up.
[00:48:49.178 --> 00:48:51.959]  Clearly, firefighters reported bombs going off.
[00:48:51.959 --> 00:48:54.741]  We have Silverstein saying they pulled Building 7.
[00:48:54.741 --> 00:48:57.102]  It goes on and on and on.
[00:48:57.102 --> 00:49:00.003]  What were the other 14 people told to do?
[00:49:00.003 --> 00:49:02.004]  Or where are they today, Mr. Rodriguez?
[00:49:02.856 --> 00:49:05.338]  Some of the people, we are unable to reach them.
[00:49:05.338 --> 00:49:11.041]  We have tried with Gretchen Manske to contact them, and we're having a difficult time.
[00:49:11.041 --> 00:49:12.942]  Some of the people, I'm still in contact with them.
[00:49:12.942 --> 00:49:15.244]  They validate and verify my story.
[00:49:15.244 --> 00:49:21.448]  But the funny thing is, Alex, that at the beginning, once my story came out, some people even chuckled.
[00:49:21.448 --> 00:49:22.608]  They said, oh, this is Superman.
[00:49:22.608 --> 00:49:27.451]  This is a funny story, because the guy did incredible things on that day.
[00:49:27.451 --> 00:49:30.113]  But once the weeks passed, and people
[00:49:32.036 --> 00:49:48.021]  On the media and asking for reunions and meetings for major networks to actually together with survivors that I saved on that day, they started to think about it and shutting off of their previous comments.
[00:49:48.021 --> 00:50:00.585]  And the funny thing is also that I even sent Mr. Greg Simansky a couple of the emails of major networks that I received during that time and during the 9-11 Commission testimony.
[00:50:01.327 --> 00:50:04.250]  For a request of interviews and it never came out.
[00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:07.913]  I did the interviews and it never came out.
[00:50:07.913 --> 00:50:08.734]  Unbelievable.
[00:50:08.734 --> 00:50:11.596]  This is just... Greg, have we gotten statements yet?
[00:50:11.596 --> 00:50:14.038]  I know you've been talking to them from CNN and others.
[00:50:14.038 --> 00:50:15.099]  Why didn't they hear this?
[00:50:15.099 --> 00:50:21.884]  You know, I'm gonna give... I'm in the process of giving CNN a call, but it's like getting through at the Pentagon nowadays.
[00:50:21.884 --> 00:50:27.029]  I mean, it used to be that, you know, you could call a journalist and they'd talk to you over the phone, but now it's very difficult.
[00:50:27.029 --> 00:50:28.330]  But I'm gonna get to the bottom of what
[00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:30.572]  Why CNN didn't run the story?
[00:50:30.572 --> 00:50:35.957]  Did you see when Gore Vidal was on CNN about three years ago and he goes, I just want to stop the press before I go live.
[00:50:35.957 --> 00:50:36.677]  This is on TV.
[00:50:36.677 --> 00:50:44.704]  He goes, before I say anything, this is the first time there hasn't been a Lieutenant General in a suit behind the cameras telling me what I can and can't say.
[00:50:44.704 --> 00:50:53.192]  Yeah, I mean, this, you know, Mr. Rodriguez's story is vitally important for every American to hear, unedited.
[00:50:53.832 --> 00:50:56.216]  That's the reason why I wanted to tell it.
[00:50:56.216 --> 00:50:57.437]  It isn't my story.
[00:50:57.437 --> 00:50:59.040]  It isn't any other journalist's story.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:03.867]  And sometimes journalists get off on this track that they own some story because they broke it first.
[00:51:03.867 --> 00:51:05.289]  No, it's not that.
[00:51:05.289 --> 00:51:09.294]  It's Mr. Rodriguez's story, and it's a story that the American people own.
[00:51:10.226 --> 00:51:16.232]  And on a day that occurred like that, to have it unedited, my goodness, what is going on?
[00:51:16.232 --> 00:51:34.108]  And we need to get answers from NBC, not from the journalists, and I assume there's probably journalists who probably wanted to run it, but from the people who... Well, I tell ya, Greg, I've talked to a lot of major national reporters and they've told me point blank, we're told not to talk about this.
[00:51:36.514 --> 00:51:39.918]  We just lost Greg and our other guests on an internet phone.
[00:51:39.918 --> 00:51:43.282]  That's why it sounds a little bit broken, but this is powerful info.
[00:51:43.282 --> 00:51:49.610]  We're going to stay with Mr. Rodriguez and we've got Mr. Roberts coming on as well.
[00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:51.011]  We're on the march.
[00:51:51.011 --> 00:51:53.534]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:51:53.534 --> 00:51:56.217]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:52:00.333 --> 00:52:04.336]  For a while now, you've been hearing about energized water and what it can do for your health.

[00:53:58.712 --> 00:54:00.453]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:54:00.453 --> 00:54:04.695]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:54:04.695 --> 00:54:07.637]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:54:07.637 --> 00:54:14.561]  The powerful Black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:54:14.561 --> 00:54:17.763]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:54:17.763 --> 00:54:20.284]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:54:20.284 --> 00:54:27.108]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organisms
[00:54:27.108 --> 00:54:27.668]  We're good to go!
[00:55:16.667 --> 00:55:26.534]  Right now, on presentplanet.com, former MI5 agent says 9-1-1 an inside job, attack was coup d'etat, buildings were demolished by controlled demolitions.
[00:55:26.534 --> 00:55:27.235]  David Shaler,
[00:55:28.044 --> 00:55:31.525]  Worked in anti-terrorism, now going public.
[00:55:31.525 --> 00:55:44.388]  And at the same time, we have the Chief Economist of one of the major federal departments, Mr. Reynolds, going public a few weeks ago about how the official story is a complete fraud.
[00:55:44.388 --> 00:55:50.309]  We have Andres Fambulo, who was the Defense Secretary Technology Minister, going public.
[00:55:50.928 --> 00:55:58.560]  We have Michael Meacher, number three in the Blair government, resigning two years ago and saying if they weren't involved in the attack, they certainly knew all about it and funded it.
[00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:02.531]  Just so many people, and online with us at the same time.
[00:56:02.531 --> 00:56:05.653]  I meant to only have him for 30 minutes, but it's such an important testimony.
[00:56:05.653 --> 00:56:12.578]  William Rodriguez, who was, again, cited for pulling out so many people trying to save him, going back in, having the building collapse on him and others.
[00:56:12.578 --> 00:56:17.921]  One of the last people to be saved, William Rodriguez, talking about those bombs, those explosions going off.
[00:56:17.921 --> 00:56:22.945]  We'll be popping back and forth with Mr. Rodriguez's story.
[00:56:24.677 --> 00:56:31.845]  Paul Craig Roberts, the bio is too long to read it all, but he was Distinguished Fellow at the Cato Institute from 93 to 96.
[00:56:31.845 --> 00:56:41.035]  From 82 through 93 he held the William E. Simon Chair in Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies from 81 to 82.
[00:56:41.035 --> 00:56:43.998]  He served as Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Economic Policy
[00:56:44.658 --> 00:56:47.260]  For President Reagan and the Treasury Secretary.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:57:02.272]  Reagan credited him with a major role in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 81 and he was awarded the Treasury Department's Meritorious Service Award for outstanding contributions to his formulation of the United States economic policy.
[00:57:03.257 --> 00:57:07.939]  And again, Dr. Roberts' bio is a couple more pages long.
[00:57:07.939 --> 00:57:09.640]  I read about 10% of it.
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.681]  But he's very distinguished, very conservative.
[00:57:12.681 --> 00:57:16.462]  I was reading some of his quotes the other day on air and he said, look, I never change, they change.
[00:57:16.462 --> 00:57:18.283]  Just like Ron Paul has talked about.
[00:57:19.083 --> 00:57:29.828]  If you think a giant government is conservative, if you think a $2.6 trillion budget is conservative, if you think all this gun control and open borders is conservative, then call me a liberal.
[00:57:29.828 --> 00:57:30.908]  That's what I'm saying.
[00:57:30.908 --> 00:57:32.249]  Alex Jones is saying that.
[00:57:32.249 --> 00:57:35.611]  I would imagine Dr. Roberts would agree with us.
[00:57:35.611 --> 00:57:38.232]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, thanks for coming on, sir.
[00:57:38.232 --> 00:57:38.532]  Thank you.
[00:57:39.714 --> 00:57:46.458]  I saw this headline with Greg Zemensky talking about how you're now questioning the official story.
[00:57:46.458 --> 00:57:52.482]  Not all the minutiae and the specifics, just how the whole thing stinks and all the lies we've been told.
[00:57:52.482 --> 00:57:56.925]  Can you tell us, sir, when you started questioning things?
[00:57:56.925 --> 00:58:01.468]  Oh, well I've been questioning things all my life, Alex.
[00:58:01.468 --> 00:58:05.430]  It's just the things that get questioned change with the event.
[00:58:07.942 --> 00:58:17.885]  I was questioning this invasion of Iraq before it happened.
[00:58:17.885 --> 00:58:29.669]  On 9-11, it's when I read Morgan Reynolds' account, which seemed to be very carefully researched, and I've known Morgan Reynolds for years.
[00:58:29.669 --> 00:58:32.550]  He's a distinguished professor.
[00:58:33.966 --> 00:58:38.488]  And he was Chief Economist in the Bush Administration for the Department of Commerce.
[00:58:38.488 --> 00:58:46.651]  He's also a member of the Mont Pelerin Society, which is a group of libertarian conservative scholars.
[00:58:46.651 --> 00:58:56.155]  By the way, sir, he's now being called an evil liberal, and you've been called that when you guys have some of the most conservative records known.
[00:58:56.155 --> 00:59:01.257]  Yes, there are certainly a lot of brownshirts out there who
[00:59:02.583 --> 00:59:06.925]  Who are true believers of whatever the government tells them.
[00:59:06.925 --> 00:59:24.731]  And, anyhow, what made me wonder when I read Morgan Reynolds' account, because over the years, because I criticized or I tell the truth about the war, I get a lot of emails from people who say, well, what about 9-11?
[00:59:24.731 --> 00:59:27.752]  What about 9-11?
[00:59:27.752 --> 00:59:29.973]  I've not paid much attention to them because I don't know
[00:59:31.161 --> 00:59:52.312]  Too much about that, but I have received a number of emails from people who claim they're engineers and they say that the building could not have fallen the way it did according to the government account of what destroyed it.
[00:59:52.312 --> 00:59:54.493]  Well, I personally have probably had 25 engineers on.
[00:59:57.464 --> 01:00:08.930]  Well, I had a good family friend who's a structural engineer who worked in the World Financial Center and saw the first plane, saw the second plane, saw it all happen and he was on that morning and he said it was a perfect
[01:00:09.571 --> 01:00:13.915]  Well, that's another very curious thing, because no plane hit the 47-story building, and yet it collapsed as the others.
[01:00:36.932 --> 01:00:37.733]  I don't know.
[01:00:56.092 --> 01:00:59.654]  They would have fallen off at an angle and wrecked blocks of New York.
[01:00:59.654 --> 01:01:08.519]  They wouldn't have come down on themselves unless the fire was of equal intensity at every corner on every floor.
[01:01:08.519 --> 01:01:11.180]  And of course it wasn't.
[01:01:11.180 --> 01:01:13.502]  Well, it was a cool black fire.
[01:01:13.502 --> 01:01:16.944]  Yeah, it was suffocating as far as the pictures show.
[01:01:16.944 --> 01:01:22.647]  People were standing in the gaping holes and the firefighters said that in one of the towers it was two small fires left.
[01:01:23.112 --> 01:01:25.914]  Yeah, and Alex, if I can interject.
[01:01:25.914 --> 01:01:28.176]  Yes, this is Mr. Rodriguez.
[01:01:28.176 --> 01:01:37.083]  Yeah, we have the presentation of the final draft of the NIST, the National Institute of Safety and Technology, here in New York, two days ago.
[01:01:37.083 --> 01:01:44.909]  And at the end of their presentation, we asked very hard questions, because they said they didn't find any evidence of explosives inside the building.
[01:01:44.909 --> 01:01:46.350]  Yeah, that made the press.
[01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:47.911]  That made the press when you guys stood up.
[01:01:47.911 --> 01:01:48.492]  Tell us about it.
[01:01:49.136 --> 01:02:07.549]  Yeah, the funny thing is that I recorded with my own camera, so we're going to make that available for you Alex, so you can post it there, so you can see exactly what happened there, because again, it was actually presented on the press, but was never explained what happened with the people asking the questions.
[01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:11.692]  Now, the problem was that they couldn't answer when we asked about
[01:02:12.409 --> 01:02:16.810]  Well, why is the building fell in such an implosion way?
[01:02:16.810 --> 01:02:24.592]  And they said, well, there was no sustaining power by the other floors, but it was a free fall.
[01:02:24.592 --> 01:02:29.233]  And if that is true, why building 7 collapsed the same way?
[01:02:29.233 --> 01:02:30.694]  And it was never hit by a plane.
[01:02:30.694 --> 01:02:35.775]  Well, let me... Mr. Rodriguez, let me bring this up to Dr. Roberts, because Dr. Roberts
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:56.767]  What are they going to do as the certain elements of the military industrial complex that have the motive in all of this, what are they going to do in your educated expert opinion as more and more prominent people, and now it's beginning to snowball, begin to go public and just simply say the emperor is wearing no clothes?
[01:02:56.767 --> 01:03:00.348]  I mean, what do you forecast happening?
[01:03:00.348 --> 01:03:04.589]  I'm not sure anything will happen.
[01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:06.370]  If you think about it, we still don't know
[01:03:08.204 --> 01:03:13.806]  About the assassination of President John Kennedy?
[01:03:13.806 --> 01:03:20.608]  I mean, it's fairly clear that it wasn't the single lone nut gunman.
[01:03:20.608 --> 01:03:21.309]  But we don't know.
[01:03:21.309 --> 01:03:22.189]  We can't find out.
[01:03:22.189 --> 01:03:25.050]  It's been 40-something years, I think.
[01:03:25.050 --> 01:03:31.872]  We don't know about the assassination of Robert Kennedy, JFK's brother.
[01:03:31.872 --> 01:03:33.572]  They lied to us about Ruby Red.
[01:03:33.572 --> 01:03:34.873]  They lied about Waco.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:43.505]  They lied about Saddam Hussein and the reason for going to war in Iraq.
[01:03:43.505 --> 01:03:50.469]  So I think we can just take for granted that the government lies about whatever.
[01:03:50.469 --> 01:03:53.031]  Yeah, they lie more often than telling the truth.
[01:03:53.031 --> 01:03:57.254]  There's no reason to believe what the government says.
[01:03:57.254 --> 01:04:02.357]  There's no record of integrity on controversial issues.
[01:04:03.596 --> 01:04:04.296]  With the government.
[01:04:04.296 --> 01:04:14.438]  And we do know that large numbers, I didn't used to think it was possible for them to hide something like the assassination of a president, what really happened.
[01:04:14.438 --> 01:04:18.979]  Because I didn't think you could get that many people to participate.
[01:04:18.979 --> 01:04:26.061]  But apparently it is possible to get people to be quiet and hush and go along.
[01:04:26.061 --> 01:04:31.222]  So I would imagine if Bush can survive the Downing Street memos,
[01:04:32.615 --> 01:04:48.599]  And, uh, in survive, uh, taking us into an illegal war that had no justification, that we were told was a cakewalk war that would be over in three weeks, and now Rumsfeld announced that this morning that it'll be 12 years.
[01:04:48.599 --> 01:04:54.260]  If they can survive that, they can survive whatever happened to the World Trade Center.
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:05:01.242]  Now, I have to say up front, I am not an expert and don't know what happened, but I do notice that
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:07.421]  There are people who challenge the explanation and there's this great effort to shut them up.
[01:05:07.421 --> 01:05:13.783]  It seems to me if the government was confident of its story, it wouldn't take that tact.
[01:05:13.783 --> 01:05:17.564]  It would confront what is being said and answer it.
[01:05:17.564 --> 01:05:18.384]  We don't see that.
[01:05:18.384 --> 01:05:25.566]  They're not answering the people like the janitor who says he heard explosions in the basement.
[01:05:25.566 --> 01:05:28.327]  There's no real reason to think so many people are making
[01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:32.221]  Well, Dr. Roberts, you just stole my thunder.
[01:05:32.221 --> 01:05:32.721]  Exactly.
[01:05:32.721 --> 01:05:38.527]  We've got Mr. Rodriguez, who is an admitted hero, who went back and tried to save people and got buried.
[01:05:38.527 --> 01:05:40.669]  He was the last person to be saved.
[01:05:40.669 --> 01:05:45.755]  He was interviewed all over live TV and then would notice that they would edit out his comments about explosions.
[01:05:46.455 --> 01:05:47.475]  Well, it seems to.
[01:05:47.475 --> 01:05:50.496]  It's amazing to me that it's that easy for them to do.
[01:05:50.496 --> 01:05:52.157]  But what disturbs me is that there are people who challenge it.
[01:06:16.147 --> 01:06:19.830]  Yet it doesn't get answered in an honest way.
[01:06:19.830 --> 01:06:28.918]  So it seems to me what the government should do is take all of these people who have a case against the original complaint and
[01:06:30.705 --> 01:06:33.846]  Address what they say and give some answer.
[01:06:33.846 --> 01:06:45.189]  But sir, I mean on the face of it, the 9-11 Commission says there were no steel columns in the center of the buildings when they had some of the biggest steel columns, 44 of them, in the world.
[01:06:45.189 --> 01:06:50.910]  They don't even mention Building 7 in their 300 and something page report or any of its indexes.
[01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:53.771]  We don't know where they got their information, do we?
[01:06:53.771 --> 01:06:57.832]  I mean, these commissions often
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:06.224]  Just, they get information that's fed to them, and so the real question is, who's feeding them the information?
[01:07:06.224 --> 01:07:08.645]  Well, we've got Rice's deputy feeding them.
[01:07:08.645 --> 01:07:13.307]  Well then, that might tell you something.
[01:07:13.706 --> 01:07:16.349]  Well, sir, I mean, let's just get right down to brass tacks here.
[01:07:16.349 --> 01:07:18.851]  Obviously, you smell a gigantic stinking rat.
[01:07:18.851 --> 01:07:20.733]  Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
[01:07:20.733 --> 01:07:22.155]  Something, you know, is dead in the attic.
[01:07:22.155 --> 01:07:23.636]  We gotta go clean it out of there.
[01:07:23.636 --> 01:07:26.459]  We know some big fat possum or raccoon is up there.
[01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:32.265]  You know, do we have the will to open, which I've done, and, you know, open the trap door and go up in there?
[01:07:32.785 --> 01:07:33.826]  That's a very interesting question.
[01:07:33.826 --> 01:07:37.448]  There is an answer to that, and that would be if they were clever enough to suck us in
[01:08:01.764 --> 01:08:04.286]  To a Middle Eastern quagmire.
[01:08:04.286 --> 01:08:18.877]  We do appear to be in a quagmire both in Iraq and in Afghanistan where the activity is again heating up and we are now leaning on the British to put more troops in Afghanistan.
[01:08:18.877 --> 01:08:22.780]  But Bush said they wanted to have permanent bases there and wanted to have somewhat of a quagmire.
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:24.581]  I guess it's not this bad of a quagmire.
[01:08:26.818 --> 01:08:34.081]  You know, if we can't occupy Baghdad or control the road to the airport, I don't know how we're going to have a permanent base.
[01:08:34.081 --> 01:08:41.623]  But I agree with you that there's too many reasons to disbelieve
[01:08:42.188 --> 01:08:42.788]  The government.
[01:08:42.788 --> 01:08:47.131]  There are too many problems with what they tell us.
[01:08:47.131 --> 01:08:48.953]  Well, Dr. Roberts, it's like this.
[01:08:48.953 --> 01:08:57.379]  If I had a neighbor for ten years who all he ever did was lie and cheat me, and then he said, hey, let me house-sit for you, why would I trust him?
[01:08:57.379 --> 01:08:59.480]  All the government does is lie and cheat us.
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:00.981]  Well, that's what I said.
[01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:03.483]  We still don't know about John F. Kennedy.
[01:09:05.235 --> 01:09:07.796]  We do know they lied about Ruby Ridge, Waco.
[01:09:07.796 --> 01:09:09.357]  We know they lied about Iraq.
[01:09:09.357 --> 01:09:12.458]  The Downing Street memos prove it beyond any question.
[01:09:12.458 --> 01:09:16.179]  Mr. Rodriguez, let's bring Mr. Rodriguez in here for a second with Dr. Roberts.
[01:09:16.179 --> 01:09:23.962]  Dr. Roberts, of course, was in the Reagan administration at a very high level as there in the Treasury Department.
[01:09:23.962 --> 01:09:28.564]  But going back to Mr. Rodriguez, Mr. Rodriguez, do you have any comments or questions for Mr. Roberts?
[01:09:28.564 --> 01:09:30.565]  Well, I have a comment, actually.
[01:09:31.505 --> 01:09:40.110]  My group and the Skycraper Safety Campaign were the only two groups that went to Washington, to Congress, to ask for a commission to be created.
[01:09:40.110 --> 01:09:44.192]  We got the commission created, but it was after a big headache.
[01:09:44.192 --> 01:09:48.014]  You may remember that the President said, we don't need a commission, we already know who did it.
[01:09:48.516 --> 01:09:56.603]  And we said, no, the families and the victims have the right to know exactly what happened and what took us to that position.
[01:09:56.603 --> 01:10:08.814]  And after a lot of press, bad press, and a lot of manipulation, we have to put actually widows and mothers on TV to actually press for the White House to change their position.
[01:10:08.814 --> 01:10:10.555]  We have the 9-11 Commission.
[01:10:10.555 --> 01:10:15.159]  After we have the 9-11 Commission, we ask them to have subpoena power, which they never used.
[01:10:15.159 --> 01:10:16.220]  They didn't want the subpoena power.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.721]  Well, let me ask Dr. Roberts this, you spurred a thought.
[01:10:18.721 --> 01:10:21.562]  Dr. Roberts, who could do a real investigation?
[01:10:21.562 --> 01:10:25.323]  We know Congress is so political and so partisan, it's not going to happen there.
[01:10:25.323 --> 01:10:31.885]  Would it be, you know, maybe a group of states getting together and having a commission or putting together our own?
[01:10:31.885 --> 01:10:35.646]  Maybe a nationally televised private commission with experts?
[01:10:35.646 --> 01:10:37.407]  I mean, how would you do that?
[01:10:37.407 --> 01:10:38.607]  I don't know.
[01:10:38.607 --> 01:10:44.609]  I think, you know, what you're trying to do, what Mr. Rodriguez is trying to do, what other people who
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:55.028]  Who's integrity forces them to ask questions, which probably don't do them any good.
[01:10:55.028 --> 01:11:02.676]  They will continue, just like people have continued to challenge the official story of Kennedy's assassination.
[01:11:02.676 --> 01:11:08.082]  And I don't know whether it will have any effect of ever getting the story correct or not.
[01:11:08.082 --> 01:11:09.003]  It may have an effect.
[01:11:09.776 --> 01:11:16.261]  Over time of making succeeding generations less trusting of what the government tells them.
[01:11:16.261 --> 01:11:22.106]  But Doctor, what about Dick Cheney in the September 2000 PNAC document saying we need a Pearl Harbor?
[01:11:22.106 --> 01:11:33.395]  Or Zygmunt Brzezinski saying a helpful Pearl Harbor for imperial mobilization to mobilize the slaves, that's us, to go attack the barbarians.
[01:11:33.395 --> 01:11:37.138]  I mean these are the type of terms they use over and over again in government and in
[01:11:37.318 --> 01:11:41.340]  Well, it's been a notorious characteristic of governments for a long time.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:15.725]  In the czarist government in pre-Bolshevik Russia, the secret police used to carry out terrorist acts so they could go arrest people that they wanted to arrest.
[01:12:15.725 --> 01:12:17.346]  They'd blame them.
[01:12:17.346 --> 01:12:21.528]  So those things do happen and have happened.
[01:12:21.528 --> 01:12:27.771]  And the question is about the World Trade Center.
[01:12:27.771 --> 01:12:34.314]  And I don't know the answer, but I agree that what we've been told seems to have problems
[01:12:35.032 --> 01:12:41.337]  And that the government is not very attentive to answering those problems.
[01:12:41.337 --> 01:12:49.142]  It has no indication of wanting to face these challenges and reply to them.
[01:12:49.142 --> 01:12:51.684]  So that tells me they're going to just ride over it.
[01:12:51.684 --> 01:12:53.525]  They're just going to ride over it the way they're doing war.
[01:12:53.525 --> 01:12:54.206]  Stay there.
[01:12:54.206 --> 01:12:54.846]  We've got a break.
[01:12:54.846 --> 01:12:56.908]  Former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Reagan.
[01:12:59.073 --> 01:13:06.215]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:07.776]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:13:07.776 --> 01:13:10.136]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:13:10.136 --> 01:13:12.497]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:13:12.497 --> 01:13:17.759]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:13:17.759 --> 01:13:21.780]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.902]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:13:23.902 --> 01:13:34.711]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:13:34.711 --> 01:13:36.813]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:13:36.813 --> 01:13:40.676]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[01:13:40.676 --> 01:13:42.037]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[01:13:58.476 --> 01:14:03.841]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:14:03.841 --> 01:14:12.188]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:14:12.188 --> 01:14:19.234]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:14:19.414 --> 01:14:20.335]  We're good to go!

[01:14:57.883 --> 01:15:00.484]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[01:15:00.484 --> 01:15:04.187]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[01:15:04.187 --> 01:15:04.667]  Shocking?
[01:15:04.667 --> 01:15:05.387]  Of course!
[01:15:05.387 --> 01:15:07.609]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[01:15:07.609 --> 01:15:10.530]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[01:15:10.530 --> 01:15:12.232]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[01:15:12.232 --> 01:15:16.674]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott, PhD.

[01:16:06.727 --> 01:16:11.896]  Folks, Dr. Roberts is going to leave us in five minutes, but I want to keep...
[01:16:12.637 --> 01:16:24.509]  Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Szymanski, on with us another 30 minutes to take your calls in the next hour and get into some other key points on 9-11 because it's the foundational event of this entire police state.
[01:16:24.509 --> 01:16:26.110]  Learn the truth about 9-11.
[01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:30.154]  Get my new film, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[01:16:30.154 --> 01:16:34.598]  We detailed how they do it, how they covered it up, who stands to gain.
[01:16:34.598 --> 01:16:36.360]  It's my best film, my third 9-11 film.
[01:16:37.910 --> 01:16:52.024]  Please get it today, 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or order a copy at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.
[01:16:52.024 --> 01:17:02.394]  Dr. Roberts, of course, writes for CounterPunch.com, AntiWar.com, Newsmax.com, of all places, and you can just type Paul Craig Roberts in and you'll see
[01:17:03.432 --> 01:17:05.353]  Literally hundreds of different websites.
[01:17:05.353 --> 01:17:09.434]  PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars are routinely linked to those stories as well.
[01:17:09.434 --> 01:17:11.295]  We find his analysis to be excellent.
[01:17:11.295 --> 01:17:20.218]  But the reason we have Mr. Roberts on is, you know, he's just saying, hey, this official story's got holes in it, and things stink to high heaven, and that's why it's important.
[01:17:20.218 --> 01:17:26.581]  More and more prominent people are stepping forward, and regardless of what happened on 9-11, I know what happened.
[01:17:26.581 --> 01:17:27.681]  You're now investigating it.
[01:17:28.281 --> 01:17:36.309]  But regardless, Dr. Roberts, they certainly are using it to destroy America while leaving the borders wide open, aren't they?
[01:17:36.309 --> 01:17:37.630]  That's for sure.
[01:17:37.630 --> 01:17:42.235]  We are losing our civil liberties very rapidly and the borders are wide open.
[01:17:42.235 --> 01:17:50.482]  And you know, something else that I just remembered, you remember the Timothy McVeigh thing, the Murrah building, the Oklahoma City bombing?
[01:17:50.482 --> 01:17:51.964]  There were a variety of experts.
[01:17:53.039 --> 01:17:56.843]  Including an Air Force General who was some sort of munitions expert.
[01:17:56.843 --> 01:17:59.505]  Benton K. Parton, former head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[01:17:59.505 --> 01:18:05.311]  Yeah, he only lived a couple blocks from me in Alexandria, Virginia.
[01:18:05.311 --> 01:18:07.012]  Inside the Beltway in Washington.
[01:18:07.012 --> 01:18:13.378]  And he said that that building blew up from the inside out.
[01:18:13.378 --> 01:18:15.921]  And I remember seeing a lot of accounts
[01:18:17.401 --> 01:18:18.301]  Of that.
[01:18:18.301 --> 01:18:19.462]  Well, I made a film about it.
[01:18:19.462 --> 01:18:23.984]  We had the police, the BATF ran up in their bomb gear seconds after the blast.
[01:18:23.984 --> 01:18:26.565]  They get, oh yeah, we were told not to come in.
[01:18:26.565 --> 01:18:27.765]  It's all on record, sir.
[01:18:27.765 --> 01:18:31.387]  They have all the surveillance cameras, but they declared national security.
[01:18:31.387 --> 01:18:40.851]  Yes, I saw that the government withholds so much information that... I mean, if they got McVeigh doing it, why not show the video, doctor?
[01:18:40.851 --> 01:18:41.731]  That's exactly right.
[01:18:41.731 --> 01:18:44.292]  If it supports their case, why not show it?
[01:18:44.292 --> 01:18:45.633]  So, I think that
[01:18:46.547 --> 01:18:47.468]  I think so.
[01:19:04.469 --> 01:19:07.210]  About Iraq and the reason for the war.
[01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:10.672]  Well, Rumsfeld says he never said there were WMDs.
[01:19:10.672 --> 01:19:12.373]  It's an urban legend, doctor.
[01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:15.314]  Does it matter if I have him on tape like a hundred times saying it?
[01:19:15.314 --> 01:19:24.118]  Well, people who will lie like that will lie about anything, and I think that is the point that people, the public, has to come to terms with.
[01:19:24.118 --> 01:19:33.623]  Has Bush stole the souls of the conservative America because so many of them mindlessly worship him when he is the 180 degree difference from conservatism?
[01:19:34.429 --> 01:19:35.970]  Well, yes he has.
[01:19:35.970 --> 01:19:40.573]  The question is whether he can keep them, and whether they wake up.
[01:19:40.573 --> 01:19:44.937]  You see, most conservatives are fighting old battles.
[01:19:44.937 --> 01:19:54.523]  They're fighting the Vietnam War over, or they're fighting Roe versus Wade over there, and they're thinking about Bush in those terms.
[01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:59.407]  If it dawns on them that they've been deceived,
[01:20:00.109 --> 01:20:02.070]  Well, yeah, you're right, Doctor.
[01:20:02.070 --> 01:20:07.092]  Conservatives think that if we discard Bush, that means we love Bill Clinton.
[01:20:19.398 --> 01:20:20.980]  And that's not the case, folks.
[01:20:20.980 --> 01:20:28.506]  We've got to discard both of these party hierarchies, and we can do that with the help of people like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:20:28.506 --> 01:20:30.928]  Doctor, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[01:20:30.928 --> 01:20:32.490]  Well, you keep raising hell, Alex.
[01:20:32.490 --> 01:20:36.033]  It never hurts for Americans to raise hell.
[01:20:36.033 --> 01:20:36.794]  God bless you, sir.
[01:20:49.421 --> 01:20:52.643]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:20:52.643 --> 01:20:55.745]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:20:55.745 --> 01:21:02.329]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfalls, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:21:02.329 --> 01:21:09.814]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:21:09.814 --> 01:21:13.836]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[01:21:14.016 --> 01:21:14.176]  Yes.
[01:21:14.176 --> 01:21:19.918]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[01:21:19.918 --> 01:21:33.222]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.

[01:21:43.626 --> 01:21:44.326]  Big Brother.
[01:21:44.326 --> 01:21:45.806]  Mainstream media.
[01:21:45.806 --> 01:21:46.947]  Government cover-ups.
[01:21:46.947 --> 01:21:53.708]  You want answers?
[01:22:09.921 --> 01:22:10.802]  Well, so does he.
[01:22:10.802 --> 01:22:15.645]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:15.645 --> 01:22:23.490]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:22:23.490 --> 01:22:28.433]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:22:28.433 --> 01:22:31.435]  We are now into hour number three.
[01:22:31.435 --> 01:22:34.337]  It is Monday, the 27th day of June 2005.
[01:22:36.545 --> 01:22:42.168]  I got a bunch of news on Iraq, a bunch of news on the police state, other whistleblowers on 9-11.
[01:22:42.168 --> 01:23:01.217]  But in this hour, we're going to take your calls, and we've got William Rodriguez, one of the major heroes of 9-11, went back into the building to say people had it collapsed on him, and he was there in the basement when the bombs went off, and he sang right before the plane even hit, and other witnesses have said that, and then he and others were told to shut up about it.
[01:23:02.343 --> 01:23:09.456]  This is just part of this tapestry of ongoing lies and Greg Zeminski who is a prolific writer for AmericanFreePress.net
[01:23:10.518 --> 01:23:13.820]  And just squadrons of other websites.
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:17.123]  His personal website is Arctic Beacon.
[01:23:17.123 --> 01:23:25.189]  And gentlemen, thanks for holding during that 25-minute interview with former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under Reagan, Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:33.615]  You know, when somebody pretty mainstream like Paul Craig Roberts says the official story is a fraud, the globalists have got a big problem, don't they, Greg?
[01:23:33.615 --> 01:23:36.537]  Yeah, you know, it's nice to hear Paul's comments.
[01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:47.678]  Yeah, I mean when you start getting people on board like this with the credibility of Mr. Roberts and others, the issue is going to have to be addressed.
[01:23:48.551 --> 01:23:53.714]  And I hope I hear the government start addressing some of these issues.
[01:23:53.714 --> 01:24:11.926]  I might add one little, on a lighter note, but not really a lighter note, there's a play going to be held, this is the first one in the country, in Hollywood, I just ran a small story on that, and hopefully it's going to be the first stage play, it's going to be at the Met Theater starting July 17th, a two-hour
[01:24:12.546 --> 01:24:15.389]  They're doing a play on government involvement, right?
[01:24:27.788 --> 01:24:37.174]  Yeah, well, no, it's basically going to go through four segments, demolitions, the hijackers, war games, and then I believe the last part's who benefits.
[01:24:37.174 --> 01:24:44.338]  So it's a real nice... I think they're using the visual medium, you know, the visual medium, and they're going to put together a nice little...
[01:24:44.718 --> 01:24:49.081]  I've seen these plays where they project video behind players on the stage.
[01:24:49.081 --> 01:24:50.102]  Yeah, they contacted me.
[01:24:50.102 --> 01:24:53.264]  They want to use William's story as an addition now.
[01:24:53.264 --> 01:25:01.549]  I saw a Philip K. Dick book, Flow My Tears the Policeman Said, that was done with those screens.
[01:25:01.549 --> 01:25:03.250]  It's a cool way to see a play.
[01:25:03.250 --> 01:25:07.353]  Yeah, and they're asking me maybe to do like a five minute intro.
[01:25:08.493 --> 01:25:15.476]  So I'm thinking about that right now, but that's a lady you should talk to, and hopefully some of the Hollywood stars will get on board to get the word across.
[01:25:15.476 --> 01:25:16.577]  Well done, Greg.
[01:25:16.577 --> 01:25:19.058]  Let's bring Mr. Rodriguez on.
[01:25:19.058 --> 01:25:24.120]  William, so many people have been standing up and telling the truth, but you were right there.
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:26.761]  You were a victim of this, and also a hero of this.
[01:25:26.761 --> 01:25:31.523]  Hearing Mr. Roberts, Dr. Roberts on, your comments?
[01:25:31.523 --> 01:25:37.525]  Well, again, it keeps opening new doors, and when you have somebody of that stature
[01:25:38.504 --> 01:25:46.447]  You can't stop thinking, wow, this is an ex-high government official who is giving it to you the way it is.
[01:25:46.447 --> 01:25:48.027]  You know, this is the important thing.
[01:25:48.027 --> 01:25:56.470]  People like you, Alex, people like Greg Simansky, people like Jimmy Walter, to open their mouth and actually put their reputation
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:01.284]  Against the actual mainstream media, this is so important.
[01:26:01.284 --> 01:26:06.108]  I mean, in my position, I was tried in a way to be bought.
[01:26:06.108 --> 01:26:09.110]  Because, you know, remember, they called me national hero.
[01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:10.912]  I was invited to the White House.
[01:26:10.912 --> 01:26:13.174]  I've been invited to a hundred different events.
[01:26:13.174 --> 01:26:17.398]  I have a room full of condecorations from different countries.
[01:26:17.398 --> 01:26:20.440]  And it's a way to buy you off.
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:23.603]  And when you don't have a clear mission,
[01:26:24.256 --> 01:26:29.538]  Uh, of where you're going and that you want to actually have the truth in front of you.
[01:26:29.538 --> 01:26:31.699]  That's what's going to happen to a lot of the people.
[01:26:31.699 --> 01:26:34.020]  People were brought left and right.
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:36.061]  And you know, a lot of it isn't even overt.
[01:26:36.061 --> 01:26:38.462]  It's just, hey, we're your friends.
[01:26:38.462 --> 01:26:39.703]  Go along with our story.
[01:26:40.323 --> 01:26:41.184]  Correct.
[01:26:41.184 --> 01:26:44.086]  A lot of people have been bought off and never really consciously thought about it.
[01:26:44.086 --> 01:26:45.848]  Stay with us, Mr. Rodriguez.
[01:26:45.848 --> 01:26:48.791]  I want to recap some of the things you've been talking about and take calls.
[01:26:48.791 --> 01:26:50.252]  Your calls coming up in the next segment.
[01:26:50.252 --> 01:26:50.312]  800-259-9231.
[01:26:50.312 --> 01:26:51.112]  Give us a call.
[01:26:51.112 --> 01:26:51.753]  We'll be right back.
[01:27:00.129 --> 01:27:03.251]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:05.153]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:10.156]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:27:10.156 --> 01:27:15.040]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:19.203]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:27:19.403 --> 01:27:22.345]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:27:22.345 --> 01:27:27.209]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:27:27.209 --> 01:27:31.873]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:27:31.873 --> 01:27:39.339]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:27:39.339 --> 01:27:41.921]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:27:41.921 --> 01:27:43.683]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:27:58.985 --> 01:28:02.727]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:28:02.727 --> 01:28:06.329]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:28:06.329 --> 01:28:10.491]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:28:10.491 --> 01:28:17.055]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:28:17.055 --> 01:28:24.939]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:28:25.359 --> 01:28:30.844]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:28:30.844 --> 01:28:34.987]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:28:34.987 --> 01:28:36.868]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[01:28:36.868 --> 01:28:39.310]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:44.294]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:28:44.294 --> 01:28:49.839]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:28:53.001 --> 01:28:54.543]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:29:00.373 --> 01:29:04.957]  Hi, I'm Tom Valentine, and I want to tell you about the Sacro Wedge.
[01:29:04.957 --> 01:29:07.679]  I don't endorse many products, but I'm endorsing this one.
[01:29:07.679 --> 01:29:15.226]  If you've got back pain, sciatica, hip pain, leg pain, knee pain, then you need to listen very closely to this message.
[01:29:15.226 --> 01:29:23.273]  For more than 10 years now, the Sacro Wedge has helped thousands find relief from the symptoms and pain of back problems.
[01:29:23.613 --> 01:29:23.874]  I think so.
[01:29:41.596 --> 01:29:41.776]  1-800-737-9295.
[01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:42.016]  That's 737-9295.
[01:29:42.016 --> 01:29:43.678]  Call them, it's only $29.95, and it really works.
[01:29:43.678 --> 01:29:43.958]  Big Brother.
[01:30:04.762 --> 01:30:06.523]  Mainstream media.
[01:30:06.523 --> 01:30:08.283]  Government cover-ups.
[01:30:08.283 --> 01:30:09.864]  You want answers?
[01:30:09.864 --> 01:30:11.805]  Well, so does he.
[01:30:11.805 --> 01:30:15.606]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:15.606 --> 01:30:19.668]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:30:28.178 --> 01:30:36.222]  A fellow Patriot broadcaster, John Stadtmiller, had a bad motorcycle accident over the weekend, for those that didn't know.
[01:30:36.222 --> 01:30:36.963]  He's okay.
[01:30:36.963 --> 01:30:41.405]  He broke his collarbone and clavicle and cracked, I think, 11 ribs.
[01:30:41.405 --> 01:30:42.586]  I talked to his wife this morning.
[01:30:42.586 --> 01:30:44.087]  I just learned of it this morning.
[01:30:44.087 --> 01:30:47.609]  I wish somebody would have called me over the weekend.
[01:30:47.609 --> 01:30:50.430]  And it's not foul play before the conspiracy theories start.
[01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:51.611]  Motorcycles are dangerous.
[01:30:51.611 --> 01:30:55.673]  And there was some gravel or something on a road where they were doing construction.
[01:30:55.673 --> 01:30:57.254]  She was following him in her van.
[01:30:58.822 --> 01:30:59.803]  She said following him.
[01:30:59.803 --> 01:31:00.784]  I don't know if it was her van.
[01:31:00.784 --> 01:31:02.025]  Oh, they have a van.
[01:31:02.025 --> 01:31:03.747]  There I am adding things.
[01:31:03.747 --> 01:31:06.709]  And he just slid out.
[01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:10.373]  And it was supposedly in traffic too, so it's a good thing he didn't get run over.
[01:31:10.373 --> 01:31:12.895]  And got hurt pretty bad.
[01:31:12.895 --> 01:31:15.338]  He's got like 12 stitches or 11 stitches somewhere.
[01:31:15.338 --> 01:31:18.921]  Again, broke over 10 ribs.
[01:31:18.921 --> 01:31:19.722]  But he's okay.
[01:31:19.722 --> 01:31:21.184]  He's making phone calls into talk shows.
[01:31:22.588 --> 01:31:27.192]  Just lets you know how transitory life is and how we should all be thankful for it.
[01:31:27.192 --> 01:31:31.235]  We should pray for John, even though we've differed on quite a few things.
[01:31:31.235 --> 01:31:32.776]  People were kind of shocked when I called up.
[01:31:32.776 --> 01:31:34.738]  I've never heard anything bad to say before.
[01:31:34.738 --> 01:31:36.179]  Other people have about me.
[01:31:36.179 --> 01:31:38.621]  I call in, oh, you're doing okay.
[01:31:38.621 --> 01:31:40.242]  Why are you calling?
[01:31:40.242 --> 01:31:40.922]  Worried about people.
[01:31:40.922 --> 01:31:42.123]  I'm a nice guy.
[01:31:42.123 --> 01:31:43.604]  That's what I do.
[01:31:43.604 --> 01:31:45.586]  I was worried about Clay Douglas.
[01:31:45.586 --> 01:31:47.968]  When Clay Douglas had his horrible motorcycle accident,
[01:31:48.843 --> 01:31:50.725]  Ask folks to send him money.
[01:31:50.725 --> 01:31:54.970]  He was really hurt bad, like, you know, in and out of consciousness for weeks.
[01:31:54.970 --> 01:31:59.215]  But thank God John is not that bad off.
[01:31:59.215 --> 01:32:00.837]  But hey, it shows what you get.
[01:32:00.837 --> 01:32:05.122]  You write big news articles about me bad in your magazine, and I say send you money.
[01:32:05.122 --> 01:32:06.243]  I'm a bad guy, folks.
[01:32:06.243 --> 01:32:08.446]  You're going to really learn that as you listen more and more to the show.
[01:32:09.961 --> 01:32:11.121]  No, I'm being sarcastic.
[01:32:11.121 --> 01:32:14.264]  But yeah, these motorcycles, folks, get rid of them.
[01:32:14.264 --> 01:32:17.046]  I've warned so many people, don't have a motorcycle.
[01:32:17.046 --> 01:32:19.008]  And they go, ah, I'm not going to handle a wreck.
[01:32:19.008 --> 01:32:20.489]  Ah, I'm tough.
[01:32:20.489 --> 01:32:23.992]  Folks, they're deadly dangerous.
[01:32:23.992 --> 01:32:30.217]  And John is at Breckenridge, and again, pray for him, that he has a speedy recovery.
[01:32:30.217 --> 01:32:31.298]  And I'm sad it happened to him.
[01:32:31.298 --> 01:32:31.999]  He's a pretty good guy.
[01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:35.460]  Let's go back to our guest.
[01:32:35.460 --> 01:32:45.246]  We're talking to Greg Zemensky, who is a prolific writer on 9-11 and other key issues, and of course, a hero of 9-11, William Rodriguez.
[01:32:45.246 --> 01:32:47.207]  William and Greg, we have loaded phones.
[01:32:47.207 --> 01:32:48.727]  You guys want to go to the calls?
[01:32:48.727 --> 01:32:49.308]  Yes, of course.
[01:32:49.308 --> 01:32:50.248]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:32:50.248 --> 01:32:51.049]  Definitely.
[01:32:51.049 --> 01:32:54.130]  Okay, let's go to Andrew in New York.
[01:32:54.130 --> 01:32:55.311]  You are on the air with our guest.
[01:32:55.311 --> 01:32:56.691]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[01:32:56.691 --> 01:32:58.552]  Thank you, gentlemen, one and all for
[01:32:59.853 --> 01:33:08.361]  Trying to come to some answers for some of us that, well, we need people out there asking questions.
[01:33:08.361 --> 01:33:19.012]  But I have one quick question and that is, did anybody save their clothing from when the buildings were exploded for residue testing of explosives?
[01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:28.810]  Actually, I have my clothing when I was from the rubble, and actually after that I was watched with water from the Hudson River.
[01:33:28.810 --> 01:33:34.611]  They have a pump to actually take all the debris from your face and your body, and I was actually watched down there.
[01:33:34.611 --> 01:33:39.532]  But I still have stuff in their pockets, like dust and stuff like that.
[01:33:39.532 --> 01:33:42.053]  So I do still have those clothing.
[01:33:42.053 --> 01:33:45.893]  Oh, you need to get that tested immediately!
[01:33:45.893 --> 01:33:47.334]  That's why I love calls.
[01:33:47.334 --> 01:33:49.134]  The callers bring up stuff we didn't think of.
[01:33:50.155 --> 01:33:57.239]  Also, again, let's talk about how they hauled that debris away, even though the victim's family said, please don't do it, it's a cover-up.
[01:33:57.239 --> 01:33:58.680]  Greg?
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.640]  It's not only that.
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:06.284]  The actual, one of the questions on the news two days ago was, what kind of testing did you do?
[01:34:06.284 --> 01:34:08.565]  I said, well, we have the actual steel.
[01:34:08.565 --> 01:34:10.386]  He said, no, no, no, no.
[01:34:10.386 --> 01:34:15.949]  You have the steel almost a year and a half after, because the actual steel was sold to China and Korea.
[01:34:16.678 --> 01:34:20.381]  So, you know, it was taken away.
[01:34:20.381 --> 01:34:23.884]  Yeah, Phil Berg's written about that in his complaint.
[01:34:23.884 --> 01:34:28.207]  And other people have written stories about FEMA's quick actions that day.
[01:34:28.207 --> 01:34:33.952]  Basically, they were nearby doing some kind of FEMA... Tripod, too.
[01:34:33.952 --> 01:34:34.893]  Yeah, nearby.
[01:34:34.893 --> 01:34:38.236]  And as soon as the thing hit, they cordoned that thing off.
[01:34:38.236 --> 01:34:39.877]  Nobody got a chance to get the evidence.
[01:34:39.877 --> 01:34:43.520]  And only their official cameras were allowed to videotape the wreckage.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:48.966]  Yeah, it was a pretty interesting situation why FEMA blocked everything off.
[01:34:48.966 --> 01:34:50.487]  Then they immediately get the rubble out.
[01:34:50.487 --> 01:34:58.816]  I even had stories where they were so concerned about the rubble that they had GPS tracking on every truck that left.
[01:34:58.816 --> 01:35:02.721]  And also a gentleman who was driving a truck, which I haven't been able to verify yet,
[01:35:04.603 --> 01:35:07.687]  No, I've confirmed that.
[01:35:07.687 --> 01:35:11.532]  I've seen that report.
[01:35:11.532 --> 01:35:17.880]  Listen, did you know in the Oklahoma City bombing, folks, it blew out, and then the news reported it showed them removing bombs.
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.322]  I have all this in Road to Tyranny.
[01:35:19.322 --> 01:35:19.803]  This is key.
[01:35:20.839 --> 01:35:23.340]  This is very important.
[01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:25.580]  That most of the building wasn't destroyed.
[01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:27.421]  Well, when Control Demolition, Inc.
[01:35:27.421 --> 01:35:40.484]  blew it up, blew up the wreckage, they hauled it away under armed guard, buried it in a landfill, poured concrete in with the chunks, and have armed guards with Heckler & Koch MP5s.
[01:35:40.484 --> 01:35:45.385]  They're guarding it to this day, ten years later.
[01:35:45.385 --> 01:35:49.966]  Just to add to that, you have, for example, Diane Horning, who has
[01:35:50.839 --> 01:36:04.742]  An organization of family members who is trying to get the actual remains from the city dump where they put everything from the workplace and she has been unsuccessful to get a proper burial for these people.
[01:36:04.742 --> 01:36:14.685]  Yeah, for those that don't know, there were the remains of literally thousands of people in there and they just know we're putting it in the dump and then shipping it to China.
[01:36:14.685 --> 01:36:14.925]  Correct.
[01:36:16.171 --> 01:36:22.666]  Yeah, basically they covered a crime scene, even in the simplest of... in a single murder in New York.
[01:36:23.831 --> 01:36:26.992]  The evidence is not tampered with and the tapes go up and the evidence is in there.
[01:36:26.992 --> 01:36:30.333]  Do you want to know where else they dumped concrete in with the chunks?
[01:36:30.333 --> 01:36:32.653]  Waco, 1993, April 19th.
[01:36:32.653 --> 01:36:34.354]  They torched the church.
[01:36:34.354 --> 01:36:43.396]  Inside the church records vault where they put a shape charge to kill the women and children and Benton Parton's on record on that as well from the photos we have of it.
[01:36:43.396 --> 01:36:47.437]  We built a memorial chapel for all those that died up in Waco.
[01:36:48.491 --> 01:36:52.453]  And we had concrete trucks coming.
[01:36:52.453 --> 01:36:55.475]  Now, I knew they took it to two different landfills.
[01:36:55.475 --> 01:36:58.837]  I knew they scraped off about a foot of the topsoil.
[01:36:58.837 --> 01:37:13.306]  But what I didn't know is they had it buried in private landfills and concrete trucks lined up, dumping concrete in with it, trying to seal it all up so even archaeologists would have trouble getting in 100 years from now.
[01:37:13.306 --> 01:37:15.707]  Gentlemen, what does that sound like to you?
[01:37:15.707 --> 01:37:16.588]  A cover-up.
[01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:21.253]  I mean, why do they do this in Oklahoma and Waco?
[01:37:21.253 --> 01:37:22.836]  Dump concrete in with the chunklets?
[01:37:22.836 --> 01:37:24.999]  It's incredible.
[01:37:24.999 --> 01:37:25.900]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:37:25.900 --> 01:37:26.441]  Amazing, man.
[01:37:27.225 --> 01:37:31.686]  You know, sometimes you've got to take this down to a human level.
[01:37:31.686 --> 01:37:33.307]  I just had this great thought.
[01:37:33.307 --> 01:37:37.248]  I sit here and I write this story about William.
[01:37:37.248 --> 01:37:46.370]  One thing in the back of my mind I think about, and that's President Bush likes to talk about how he's the president of the people and the president of NASCAR.
[01:37:46.370 --> 01:37:48.711]  He likes to sit and have a beer with everybody.
[01:37:48.711 --> 01:37:49.791]  He can talk to anybody.
[01:37:49.791 --> 01:37:56.253]  Well, I'm going to say right now, Mr. President, why don't you sit and have a beer with Mr. Rodriguez and answer some of his questions?
[01:37:57.068 --> 01:37:58.509]  That is true, that is true.
[01:37:58.509 --> 01:38:05.352]  And actually, I'm glad that you mentioned Phil Berg, because actually I put up, I am the plaintiff of the lawsuit against the President.
[01:38:05.352 --> 01:38:15.796]  It's a recall lawsuit, and people can actually go to the website and petition, sign the petition of this to go actually to the federal court.
[01:38:15.796 --> 01:38:17.997]  We already went to the first level.
[01:38:17.997 --> 01:38:18.878]  What website is that?
[01:38:20.028 --> 01:38:25.313]  www.911forthetruth.com.
[01:38:25.313 --> 01:38:26.334]  911forthetruth.com.
[01:38:26.334 --> 01:38:30.978]  Again, Mr. Rodriguez is on an internet phone, that's why you hear that cutting out.
[01:38:30.978 --> 01:38:34.721]  We'll give that out again before... Yeah, 911forthetruth.com.
[01:38:34.721 --> 01:38:40.987]  But if anybody wants to contact me after the show, they can do it through you, through your show.
[01:38:42.601 --> 01:38:56.152]  And I'd be available for any kind of questions or any kind of request as long as... Well, we're going to be having you back on and I want you to send me the substantive video and I'll get it out and put it on the web and millions will see it because this needs to be seen.
[01:38:56.152 --> 01:38:58.714]  I need to do a little mini video report and maybe Greg can write about it.
[01:38:58.714 --> 01:39:00.475]  Let's go to Elizabeth in Maryland.
[01:39:00.475 --> 01:39:01.236]  Elizabeth, go ahead.
[01:39:01.236 --> 01:39:03.878]  You're on the air with Mr. Rodriguez.
[01:39:03.878 --> 01:39:04.078]  Go ahead.
[01:39:04.858 --> 01:39:14.301]  Before I called you I saw Psalm 74, have respect under the covenant for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
[01:39:14.301 --> 01:39:26.465]  And something that I heard this morning on GCN is so disturbing and ominous that I went to prayer who to reach, you or Dr. Stan or who, and I felt the Lord told me you are the only one who will bring this out.
[01:39:26.465 --> 01:39:29.546]  And hearing this good program again, this vital program,
[01:39:30.086 --> 01:39:33.389]  With Greg and with Mr. Rodriguez, I congratulate them.
[01:39:33.389 --> 01:39:40.914]  And very quickly, not to waste your time, what I did here was Janet C. Phelan, who was a reporter at the St.
[01:39:40.914 --> 01:39:43.336]  Monica Daily Press,
[01:39:44.122 --> 01:39:49.847]  And she was looking into something very ominous and strange going on with the waterworks that's coming in St.
[01:39:49.847 --> 01:39:52.489]  Louis, she said, Vermont, and Houston.
[01:39:52.489 --> 01:39:57.253]  And actually, the title of her thing is Public Extermination Project.
[01:39:57.253 --> 01:40:01.557]  And she can get no answers, and just like Greg, she can't get the press.
[01:40:01.557 --> 01:40:03.899]  She resigned after she saw their attitude.
[01:40:03.899 --> 01:40:06.041]  Now, who is she?
[01:40:06.041 --> 01:40:08.303]  Alright, she's Janet C. Phelan.
[01:40:08.303 --> 01:40:08.723]  P-H-E-L-A-N.
[01:40:10.965 --> 01:40:15.890]  And her email address is jc... Janet, hold on, let's go slower here.
[01:40:15.890 --> 01:40:17.611]  Because your phone's cutting out.
[01:40:17.611 --> 01:40:18.852]  Janet what?
[01:40:18.852 --> 01:40:21.895]  Janet C. Phelan.
[01:40:21.895 --> 01:40:24.037]  P-H-E-L-A-N.
[01:40:24.037 --> 01:40:25.679]  I got that, Janet C. Phelan.
[01:40:25.679 --> 01:40:27.360]  Right, and here's her email.
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:28.121]  I mean, who is she?
[01:40:28.121 --> 01:40:28.922]  Who does she work for?
[01:40:28.922 --> 01:40:30.623]  She works for the St.
[01:40:30.623 --> 01:40:32.625]  Monica... What am I saying here?
[01:40:32.625 --> 01:40:32.965]  St.
[01:40:32.965 --> 01:40:33.366]  Monica...
[01:40:34.272 --> 01:40:35.734]  In California, Daily Press.
[01:40:35.734 --> 01:40:36.916]  Santa Monica.
[01:40:36.916 --> 01:40:37.937]  Yes, okay.
[01:40:37.937 --> 01:40:38.679]  I'm a little nervous.
[01:40:38.679 --> 01:40:40.341]  I waited a long time and a lot was going on here.
[01:40:40.341 --> 01:40:42.664]  And she found out about something called a public extermination?
[01:40:42.664 --> 01:40:46.330]  She found out about key valves being used
[01:40:46.977 --> 01:40:58.845]  And, uh, this was happening in the Palisades Park area, and she just now has an article sitting on Henry Waxman's desk requesting that he honor her request to address Congress.
[01:40:58.845 --> 01:40:59.345]  I mean, be specific.
[01:40:59.345 --> 01:41:01.947]  I mean, just in a nutshell, what is she saying they're doing?
[01:41:01.947 --> 01:41:06.710]  Alright, there's something going on where they can close off this stuff, these T-valves.
[01:41:06.710 --> 01:41:08.191]  See, I didn't hear everything.
[01:41:08.191 --> 01:41:10.473]  Okay, how does that kill us?
[01:41:10.473 --> 01:41:12.534]  Uh, they can put, do something with the
[01:41:12.534 --> 01:41:13.534]  The water.
[01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:14.835]  And there was more to it.
[01:41:14.835 --> 01:41:17.096]  So I really suggest you check with her.
[01:41:17.096 --> 01:41:20.997]  jcphalen10 at yahoo.com.
[01:41:20.997 --> 01:41:24.198]  jcphalen10 at yahoo.com.
[01:41:24.198 --> 01:41:28.199]  And you know, I think this is something that it could be disinformation.
[01:41:28.199 --> 01:41:29.260]  But I trust you.
[01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:32.881]  You don't have a lot of the New Age stuff on your program.
[01:41:32.881 --> 01:41:36.462]  I believe that you and Dr. Stan are true blue.
[01:41:36.462 --> 01:41:37.903]  And what alarmed me was
[01:41:38.824 --> 01:41:49.652]  I was just reading in Bob Rosio's book about how at the end of World War II, they found there was enough Zyklon B gas left to kill millions more.
[01:41:49.652 --> 01:41:52.414]  Look, I'll try to track this down and get it exactly what you're talking about.
[01:41:52.414 --> 01:41:53.035]  Thank you so much.
[01:41:53.035 --> 01:41:55.157]  We'll let our guest comment on that.
[01:41:55.157 --> 01:41:57.879]  If our government will do all this, what else might they do?
[01:41:57.879 --> 01:42:01.762]  I think that's kind of the... So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:42:01.762 --> 01:42:05.905]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:42:05.905 --> 01:42:06.706]  Read the labels.
[01:42:07.126 --> 01:42:11.490]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:42:11.490 --> 01:42:16.053]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:42:16.053 --> 01:42:21.318]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:42:21.318 --> 01:42:25.101]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal Bend Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:42:25.101 --> 01:42:30.705]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils, and vegetable protein oils.
[01:42:30.705 --> 01:42:33.728]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow, or testing.
[01:42:33.728 --> 01:42:34.929]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:42:34.929 --> 01:42:35.509]  Call now.
[01:42:35.509 --> 01:42:35.529]  1-800

[01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:40.003]  Try Halo Methanes and volatile organic elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.

[01:46:10.290 --> 01:46:11.230]  We're honored to have him.
[01:46:11.230 --> 01:46:15.451]  Talk show host that comes on right after this broadcast every day at 2 o'clock.
[01:46:15.451 --> 01:46:26.095]  Jack had a question for Greg Zemensky and for William Rodriguez, one of the heroes of 9-11, blowing the whistle about bombs in the buildings.
[01:46:26.095 --> 01:46:28.136]  Jack, who would you like to address first?
[01:46:28.136 --> 01:46:29.717]  Well, thanks again for putting me on.
[01:46:29.717 --> 01:46:32.638]  I don't want to take up too much time away from the other listeners.
[01:46:32.638 --> 01:46:36.239]  I congratulate you and all your guests today for just doing a fantastic job.
[01:46:36.839 --> 01:46:49.388]  First, William Rodriguez, who was on my program four or five months ago, I don't know if I missed it, but he was talking on my program about meeting Muhammad Atta at the World Trade Center and how the 9-11 Commission covered that up.
[01:46:49.388 --> 01:46:53.271]  And then I'm just going to drop a quick question for Greg Siminski, and I'll get my answers off the air.
[01:46:53.271 --> 01:46:59.755]  Greg has written a new article on the 2004 vote fraud with some new developments, and I'd hope that he would maybe share a little bit of that with the listeners.
[01:46:59.755 --> 01:47:01.756]  So, Alex, I'll let you go, and I'll listen off air.
[01:47:01.756 --> 01:47:02.357]  Keep up the good work.
[01:47:02.697 --> 01:47:03.739]  Take care, Jack.
[01:47:03.739 --> 01:47:10.887]  Uh, yes, Mr. Rodriguez, you say that you might have seen some of the hijackers before 9-11?
[01:47:10.887 --> 01:47:17.836]  Commission behind closed doors that I saw, it wasn't Mohamed Ara, it was Mohamed Al-Shahiri.
[01:47:17.836 --> 01:47:20.780]  I'll tell you what, start over because we didn't have you faded up right at the first.
[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:21.521]  Start over, go ahead.
[01:47:22.210 --> 01:47:39.622]  Okay, I did testify for the 9-11 Commission behind closed doors, and I told them that I saw one of the hijackers, Mohamed Al-Shahiri, and that actually he was taking the building, because actually on that day,
[01:47:40.803 --> 01:47:47.929]  I was cleaning the bathrooms on the middle of the complex and he was asking how many public bathrooms were available.
[01:47:47.929 --> 01:48:00.741]  The commission investigators were very angry because I told this to the FBI and I kept quiet for several years thinking that there was an official investigation and then I realized that they didn't do anything about the information that I gave them.
[01:48:01.421 --> 01:48:21.032]  And they were very angry, the investigators, because they said, here is not only an eyewitness account that one of the hijackers was inside the building, and number two, that they have a second alternate plan, which was to actually place bombs in the public bathrooms to actually accelerate the fall of the building.
[01:48:21.032 --> 01:48:22.533]  Now, this is not me saying this.
[01:48:22.533 --> 01:48:24.854]  This is the actual investigators speculating.
[01:48:24.854 --> 01:48:26.595]  Now, the investigators work for the Commission.
[01:48:27.362 --> 01:48:31.925]  And the commission never put that statement on the final report.
[01:48:31.925 --> 01:48:43.372]  My statement, I don't know how the media found out, the Daily News contacted me that they knew I testified about seeing one of the hijackers.
[01:48:43.372 --> 01:48:50.656]  They put it on the newspaper as an exclusive, and I got only two calls from the national media to talk about it, and then it never went on the air.
[01:48:52.243 --> 01:49:04.290]  Again, this is the incredible thing that on the Latino community, I mean, I'm from Puerto Rico, but I have created the first family group, which is the Hispanic Victims Group.
[01:49:04.290 --> 01:49:10.673]  I went national and then international all over Latin America with all these statements.
[01:49:10.673 --> 01:49:17.357]  I mean, I've been the subject of over 17 different television specials, but all in Spanish.
[01:49:18.107 --> 01:49:19.348]  Nothing in English.
[01:49:19.348 --> 01:49:22.912]  It's like the story has been totally ignored in English.
[01:49:22.912 --> 01:49:24.353]  Total media control.
[01:49:24.353 --> 01:49:25.915]  Greg Zemensky?
[01:49:25.915 --> 01:49:31.220]  Well, you know, I think it was Jack, wasn't it, that asked that question about the... Yeah, Jack Blood, yeah.
[01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:32.081]  Yeah.
[01:49:32.081 --> 01:49:34.603]  Well, that basically is a story about a story, and it's very interesting.
[01:49:34.603 --> 01:49:38.467]  Bob Kohler, who's a well-respected... He works for Tribune Media Services.
[01:49:38.467 --> 01:49:39.188]  He's an editor.
[01:49:39.768 --> 01:49:40.468]  We're good to go.
[01:49:58.997 --> 01:50:02.863]  But they chose to run a rebuttal calling him a conspiracy nut.
[01:50:02.863 --> 01:50:11.575]  Well, this upset Bob, and I talked to Bob at length on this story and ran a story about him because I thought it was quite interesting and explained the media hush and cover up.
[01:50:11.575 --> 01:50:14.680]  Well, basically, Bob was going to write a rebuttal to the rebuttal.
[01:50:15.487 --> 01:50:19.888]  But decided against it because he didn't want it to seem like just an in-house squabble.
[01:50:19.888 --> 01:50:23.249]  But basically, finally got a letter to the editor printed in the Tribune.
[01:50:23.249 --> 01:50:26.490]  Well, the story never appeared, and he said very few people print anything.
[01:50:26.490 --> 01:50:32.412]  He only has 12 clients across the country, but when he runs stories like that, people don't run them.
[01:50:32.412 --> 01:50:36.253]  So it shows you, basically, the Tribune hushes up their own people.
[01:50:37.187 --> 01:50:39.451]  Knocked him down in the sweetheart rung and got dropped off some columns.
[01:50:49.595 --> 01:50:51.056]  Knocked him down a rung.
[01:50:51.056 --> 01:50:53.277]  Oh, of course, and Bob, you'd love to have him on.
[01:50:53.277 --> 01:50:56.938]  It'll tell you what the mainstream, what, you know, he's one of the few renegades in the mainstream media.
[01:50:56.938 --> 01:51:04.742]  Well, look, totally clearly, I mean, the Democratic Party is totally corrupt, totally evil, just like the Republicans, but they can't just steal an election.
[01:51:04.742 --> 01:51:15.427]  They've then got to have Kerry take a dive, which he did do, but clearly Al Gore won in 2000, clearly in November of 2004, John Forbes Kerry won.
[01:51:15.427 --> 01:51:15.787]  Exactly.
[01:51:15.787 --> 01:51:17.748]  I mean, look at these approval ratings now, but again,
[01:51:18.799 --> 01:51:20.861]  It doesn't mean I'm for Carrier Al Gore.
[01:51:20.861 --> 01:51:29.246]  It just shows that even when they give us two false choices, they then pick which of the choices we get, even when we pick the other one.
[01:51:29.246 --> 01:51:31.288]  Yes, Banana Republic.
[01:51:31.288 --> 01:51:32.389]  It's very nice.
[01:51:32.389 --> 01:51:34.790]  Gentlemen, you want to keep Rodney Shotgun with us?
[01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:35.571]  Sure.
[01:51:35.571 --> 01:51:37.632]  How about you, Mr. Rodriguez?
[01:51:37.632 --> 01:51:38.333]  Sure.
[01:51:38.333 --> 01:51:39.814]  Al, we're really honored to have you, sir.
[01:51:39.814 --> 01:51:40.814]  We'll give that website out again.
[01:51:40.814 --> 01:51:45.337]  We'll come back and talk to Mike and Victor and Mark and many others.
[01:51:45.337 --> 01:51:45.858]  Stay with us.
[01:51:49.042 --> 01:51:52.989]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:51:52.989 --> 01:51:55.654]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:51:59.734 --> 01:52:07.159]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[01:52:07.159 --> 01:52:13.003]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X nail gel.
[01:52:13.003 --> 01:52:22.969]  All Natural Non-X is a topical ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[01:52:23.129 --> 01:52:25.890]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:52:25.890 --> 01:52:29.170]  I used to have yellow nails and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[01:52:29.170 --> 01:52:30.671]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[01:52:30.671 --> 01:52:38.412]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:52:38.412 --> 01:52:40.493]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:52:40.493 --> 01:52:51.775]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[01:52:52.755 --> 01:52:59.098]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals!
[01:52:59.098 --> 01:53:02.700]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:53:02.700 --> 01:53:03.420]  are located?
[01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:07.022]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:53:07.022 --> 01:53:12.004]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[01:53:19.207 --> 01:53:23.570]  The safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.

[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:39.441]  We're good to go.
[01:53:58.385 --> 01:54:02.007]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:54:02.007 --> 01:54:02.367]  Why?
[01:54:02.367 --> 01:54:05.389]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[01:55:31.414 --> 01:55:32.254]  Frankly, all of them.
[01:55:32.254 --> 01:55:33.874]  They're all excellent.
[01:55:33.874 --> 01:55:43.456]  And we're going to go to your calls, and then I'm going to give Greg and William a chance to just talk about anything they think is important to reiterate or anything we haven't covered.
[01:55:43.456 --> 01:55:45.276]  But let's get a lot of these callers out of the way.
[01:55:45.276 --> 01:55:48.177]  Callers, I'm going to go to you quickly, so have your question or comment ready.
[01:55:48.177 --> 01:55:49.297]  Mark in Texas, go ahead.
[01:55:52.032 --> 01:55:52.733]  Yes, Mark.
[01:55:52.733 --> 01:55:53.854]  Yes, welcome.
[01:55:53.854 --> 01:55:54.655]  Welcome, thank you.
[01:55:54.655 --> 01:55:58.699]  I'm trying to get the exact chronology straight here with Mr. Rodriguez.
[01:55:58.699 --> 01:56:09.951]  He was in the basement at 8.45 in the morning when the first explosion that he felt occurred, and then how many seconds after that
[01:56:10.754 --> 01:56:12.095]  What did the plane do?
[01:56:12.095 --> 01:56:15.397]  Probably, uh, two or three seconds after that.
[01:56:15.397 --> 01:56:16.398]  Two or three seconds?
[01:56:16.398 --> 01:56:23.102]  He gave me the time to think, wow, this is an explosion from one of the electrical generators on the basement.
[01:56:23.102 --> 01:56:23.342]  Okay.
[01:56:23.342 --> 01:56:26.825]  That's exactly the time that it took for then the second explosion.
[01:56:26.825 --> 01:56:32.348]  So, boom, shake, oh, I bet that's the generators, I bet that's what happened, boom.
[01:56:32.348 --> 01:56:33.029]  Correct.
[01:56:33.029 --> 01:56:35.750]  And the second boom was above you, and that was the plane?
[01:56:35.750 --> 01:56:39.473]  Above, way above, and you could hear it that it was from pretty far away.
[01:56:40.194 --> 01:56:40.935]  All right.
[01:56:40.935 --> 01:56:43.219]  Then there was yet another explosion beneath you.
[01:56:43.219 --> 01:56:44.661]  Another explosion.
[01:56:44.661 --> 01:56:51.933]  What I was explained was that actually once the plane hit
[01:56:52.478 --> 01:56:56.501]  The wings blew up because he has all the gasoline on the wings.
[01:56:56.501 --> 01:56:59.103]  So that was several explosions that you heard.
[01:56:59.103 --> 01:57:11.332]  But then, the funny thing is that as I testified and that I went... One thing that... One fact that I haven't talked about is that I have the only master key that was used on the North Tower.
[01:57:11.332 --> 01:57:13.734]  There were five master keys in the building.
[01:57:13.734 --> 01:57:14.635]  And I have one of them.
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:22.466]  And I was followed by the fire department as I went up the stairwells, opening the doors so people could get out from the offices.
[01:57:22.466 --> 01:57:26.289]  And as I went up, I heard explosions on the lower floors.
[01:57:26.289 --> 01:57:31.353]  I'm talking about in between the 20th and the 30th floor.
[01:57:31.353 --> 01:57:39.019]  And once I got to the 33rd floor, on the 33rd floor, I was by myself because the whole fire unit collapsed on the 27th floor.
[01:57:40.536 --> 01:57:47.080]  And I continue by myself, and then I found a lady on the floor, on the 33rd floor, trembling.
[01:57:47.080 --> 01:57:51.502]  I stood her up, put her on the stairwell, and then I heard something very strange.
[01:57:51.502 --> 01:57:54.624]  On the 34th floor, I heard strange movement.
[01:57:54.624 --> 01:57:58.526]  Now, when I say strange movement, it's like heavy equipment.
[01:57:59.019 --> 01:58:05.481]  Like dumpsters with those metal wheels being moved around the floor.
[01:58:05.481 --> 01:58:11.503]  Now, the strange thing is that that floor is an empty, hollowed out construction floor.
[01:58:11.503 --> 01:58:13.023]  There was nobody there.
[01:58:13.023 --> 01:58:17.105]  There was no equipment supposedly on that floor.
[01:58:17.105 --> 01:58:19.825]  So I got scared because I was by myself.
[01:58:19.825 --> 01:58:25.127]  So I bypassed that floor with the master key and continued to the other upper floors.
[01:58:25.127 --> 01:58:27.988]  So I did explain that and I never got an answer about that.
[01:58:29.162 --> 01:58:34.196]  And what were the, did you hear explosions just before the building collapsed around you at the end, or how did that?
[01:58:35.343 --> 01:58:37.585]  Yes, well actually I went up the stairwells.
[01:58:37.585 --> 01:58:43.530]  I heard a lot of mini explosions and then on the 39th floor, I got up to the 39th floor.
[01:58:43.530 --> 01:58:52.438]  On the 39th floor, the police officer that was with me on the lower levels actually met me from the opposite stairwell.
[01:58:52.438 --> 01:59:02.366]  There were three stairwells, A, B, and C. I was on the B and he came from the A staircase and we met practically in front of the doorframe.
[01:59:02.839 --> 01:59:03.339]  I don't know.
[01:59:22.771 --> 01:59:38.156]  All of a sudden we hear PAPA PAPA PAPA PAPA on our building and on the radio we hear we lost 65 we lost 65 meaning that the 65th floor collapsed one floor on top of the other inside the building up to the Sky Lobby which was the 44th floor.
[01:59:38.156 --> 01:59:40.517]  And that came right after the boom boom boom?
[01:59:40.517 --> 01:59:41.458]  Correct.
[01:59:41.458 --> 01:59:48.460]  Because we have firefighters saying it was as if they had detonators boom boom boom boom boom and we have those clips.
[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:50.541]  It sounded just exactly like that and
[01:59:51.579 --> 01:59:56.642]  What they explained to me was that the building was collapsing inside before it actually collapsed outside.
[01:59:56.642 --> 01:59:57.742]  Which it didn't make sense to me.
[01:59:57.742 --> 01:59:59.023]  Well, that's what it showed.
[01:59:59.023 --> 02:00:01.384]  Little explosions going down the side, then it collapsed.
[02:00:01.384 --> 02:00:03.805]  That's how a controlled demolition happens.
[02:00:03.805 --> 02:00:05.206]  Thank you for the call, Mark.
[02:00:05.206 --> 02:00:06.386]  Really good questions.
[02:00:06.386 --> 02:00:08.127]  I want to get to everybody real fast.
[02:00:08.127 --> 02:00:10.308]  Greg Zemensky, comments?
[02:00:10.308 --> 02:00:11.229]  No, go ahead, Alec.
[02:00:11.229 --> 02:00:12.269]  Get to your callers.
[02:00:12.269 --> 02:00:14.470]  Alright, let's go to Mike in New York.
[02:00:14.470 --> 02:00:15.291]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[02:00:15.291 --> 02:00:15.611]  Welcome.
[02:00:19.230 --> 02:00:22.051]  Mike's been holding for eons and must have decided not to hold any longer.
[02:00:22.051 --> 02:00:24.813]  Victor in Missouri.
[02:00:24.813 --> 02:00:25.633]  Victor, go ahead.
[02:00:25.633 --> 02:00:27.294]  Hey, guys.
[02:00:27.294 --> 02:00:37.738]  All this Waco, Ruby Ridge, the Murrah Building, all these are symptoms of the real problem, which is the monster in Washington.
[02:00:37.738 --> 02:00:43.561]  And it feeds on misplaced respect and honor and Federal Reserve notes.
[02:00:43.561 --> 02:00:45.442]  And you know how to kill a monster?
[02:00:45.442 --> 02:00:48.043]  You stop feeding the damn thing and calling it
[02:00:48.706 --> 02:00:50.487]  Government.
[02:00:50.487 --> 02:00:53.689]  Well, it is an organized crime syndicate masquerading as government.
[02:00:53.689 --> 02:00:54.269]  That's right.
[02:00:54.269 --> 02:00:59.132]  And as long as we even call it or refer to it... Well, it's just like the Mafia, too.
[02:00:59.132 --> 02:01:00.492]  It gives us loans.
[02:01:00.492 --> 02:01:01.433]  It gives us money.
[02:01:01.433 --> 02:01:04.575]  It gets us dependent on it, but only for control.
[02:01:04.575 --> 02:01:08.117]  I really don't think the Mafia is as bad as that thing in Washington.
[02:01:08.117 --> 02:01:08.937]  Well, it is the Mafia.
[02:01:08.937 --> 02:01:09.417]  It's the super Mafia.
[02:01:09.417 --> 02:01:12.079]  In a way, if you stop feeding it, it'll die or go away.
[02:01:12.079 --> 02:01:13.700]  Any comments or questions for our guest?
[02:01:13.700 --> 02:01:14.240]  That was it.
[02:01:15.406 --> 02:01:16.166]  Victor, thank you.
[02:01:16.166 --> 02:01:16.447]  Comments?
[02:01:16.447 --> 02:01:17.187]  You're very welcome.
[02:01:17.187 --> 02:01:19.308]  Thank you, Mr. Rodriguez.
[02:01:19.308 --> 02:01:21.449]  Mr. Zemensky, any comments on what he just said?
[02:01:21.449 --> 02:01:31.373]  Yeah, all I wanted to say was that, for a gentleman like this, that we have to take this on a daily basis and continue to have our stories told and to continue, continue on a daily basis.
[02:01:31.373 --> 02:01:31.953]  Exactly!
[02:01:31.953 --> 02:01:38.055]  People think it's an instant gratification society of wanting the hamburger in 60 seconds or we get angry.
[02:01:38.055 --> 02:01:39.716]  Folks, it's gonna take time.
[02:01:39.716 --> 02:01:41.677]  I love that movie, The Guns of Navarone.
[02:01:42.618 --> 02:01:45.981]  And then in the part two of it, Force 10 from Navarone.
[02:01:45.981 --> 02:01:48.083]  You ever seen Force 10 from Navarone?
[02:01:48.083 --> 02:01:48.644]  I haven't, no.
[02:01:48.644 --> 02:01:50.025]  This is the first one.
[02:01:50.025 --> 02:01:55.150]  Okay, well Force 10 from Navarone has got a Mr. Harrison Ford in it.
[02:01:56.022 --> 02:02:00.106]  And the analogy is, they bomb the Nazi dam to destroy the army below it.
[02:02:00.106 --> 02:02:02.888]  This is an analogy of an Info War.
[02:02:02.888 --> 02:02:08.573]  And when they bomb the dam, they expect it to fall right away, but the demolition guy goes, no, it'll take some time.
[02:02:08.573 --> 02:02:12.457]  You know, this thing, this New World Order won't be blown up instantly.
[02:02:12.457 --> 02:02:19.603]  It's all of us in the Info War firing and firing and firing and firing the truth at them, day after day, relentlessly.
[02:02:19.603 --> 02:02:21.525]  That is what will bring them down.
[02:02:21.525 --> 02:02:23.006]  And we're having victories, gentlemen.
[02:02:23.931 --> 02:02:30.236]  Yeah, you know, Alex, we're all in this story together, and we all have parts to play.
[02:02:30.236 --> 02:02:44.527]  And the most important parts are Mr. Rodriguez continuing to talk, and for people continuing to listen, because if they listen to him, then all the other parts of the story will not be quite as confusing.
[02:02:44.527 --> 02:02:46.769]  And that's what the government hopes to happen.
[02:02:46.769 --> 02:02:47.630]  Let me add to that.
[02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:54.742]  And this is for the radio audience out there.
[02:02:54.742 --> 02:02:59.644]  I have nothing whatsoever to gain with this.
[02:02:59.644 --> 02:03:05.006]  It's not even fame because I already was on practically all over the world with this news.
[02:03:05.006 --> 02:03:12.368]  And the funny thing is that people don't understand that the reason we're doing this, especially me, is a mission.
[02:03:12.368 --> 02:03:15.690]  I lost 200 friends that work at the building.
[02:03:15.690 --> 02:03:19.231]  And they have no voice whatsoever to speak for them.
[02:03:19.887 --> 02:03:23.972]  So it's my responsibility as a survivor and as a leader now...
[02:03:24.693 --> 02:03:35.500]  To make those questions available to everybody, not only to those commissions, but to everybody so they could actually excuse it and look into themselves and say, is this true?
[02:03:35.500 --> 02:03:36.541]  Is this what happened?
[02:03:36.541 --> 02:03:53.452]  Because going back to what you said before with that gentleman from the former administration of Reagan, what we need to have to actually investigate is an international commission of victims of terrorism that will be totally autonomous.
[02:03:54.375 --> 02:03:55.116]  I don't know.
[02:04:07.509 --> 02:04:08.889]  That's the way to do it.
[02:04:08.889 --> 02:04:14.211]  And I tell you something, we cannot have that commission established here in the United States.
[02:04:14.211 --> 02:04:16.512]  And that won't be the end-all be-all either.
[02:04:16.512 --> 02:04:18.352]  It's all part of a process.
[02:04:18.352 --> 02:04:21.453]  And we should look at who stands to gain from terrorism.
[02:04:21.453 --> 02:04:24.274]  And I'll say this, and I want both of you to comment on it briefly, then we're going to go back to calls.
[02:04:25.003 --> 02:04:25.944]  They're not going to stop.
[02:04:25.944 --> 02:04:28.306]  The globalists are going to carry out more terror attacks.
[02:04:28.306 --> 02:04:29.827]  They've said it's going to happen.
[02:04:29.827 --> 02:04:31.768]  They stand to gain from it.
[02:04:31.768 --> 02:04:38.794]  And so we're trying to save more lives by exposing who's behind this and bringing the real perpetrators to justice, Greg.
[02:04:38.794 --> 02:04:43.878]  Well, yeah, you know, the question always, the people that I talk to a lot, is when's the next shoe going to fall?
[02:04:43.878 --> 02:04:47.641]  And the next question becomes where, when, and why.
[02:04:47.641 --> 02:04:48.542]  And we know it's coming.
[02:04:49.162 --> 02:04:56.128]  And basically, I think it's time to at least let them know that the charade's up and we know what's going to happen.
[02:04:56.128 --> 02:05:02.693]  The question is, they stay one step ahead of us, and they have the resources, the power, the control.
[02:05:02.693 --> 02:05:11.580]  But if we discredit them and show people who has the motive, then they may not be able to carry out the attack because they'll test the waters and know that we're not going to buy it.
[02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:17.164]  Exactly, and that's why it's important that the critical mass is reached, because once the critical mass is reached,
[02:05:17.424 --> 02:05:19.066]  I think we're reaching that critical mass.
[02:05:19.066 --> 02:05:20.227]  I think so too.
[02:05:20.227 --> 02:05:21.008]  I think so too.
[02:05:21.008 --> 02:05:33.402]  And as this lady who's putting on this play in Hollywood says, it's the second wave now and she wants to be part of this second wave of people to listen now to the 9-11 story that a lot of us have been talking about.
[02:05:33.902 --> 02:05:51.259]  I mean, I look at it as a giant juggernaut, a tank coming towards us, and we're all just firing at it with a concerted effort, and it's blaring on its loudspeaker, you can't stop me, I'm invincible, but the thing is smoking, you know, there's fire coming out from underneath it, it's about, it's slowing down.
[02:05:51.259 --> 02:05:56.444]  Let's go to Don in Michigan, then we'll go to Annette and Michael and others.
[02:05:56.444 --> 02:05:57.525]  Don in Michigan, go ahead.
[02:05:58.447 --> 02:05:59.308]  Hello, Alex.
[02:05:59.308 --> 02:06:00.450]  Yes, sir.
[02:06:00.450 --> 02:06:08.680]  Hey, I received notice a few days ago that up here in Jackson, Michigan, on the south side of town, there's a park called Sparks Foundation County Park.
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:15.608]  And inside that county park, inside of a glass cage, is a section of an outer beam from the World Trade Center.
[02:06:15.608 --> 02:06:17.831]  So I went up to take some pictures over the weekend.
[02:06:18.531 --> 02:06:23.352]  And what I found on this beam, like I say, it's inside of a glass cage.
[02:06:23.352 --> 02:06:30.994]  I did a search on this also and I found no other beams on display except for one that's at the George Bush Museum.
[02:06:30.994 --> 02:06:32.514]  And I took some pictures of this.
[02:06:32.514 --> 02:06:35.935]  I'm going to send them out to you, but I wanted to talk to you a little bit about this.
[02:06:35.935 --> 02:06:41.816]  It looks, it appears as if the edges, the ends of this beam were sheared off.
[02:06:41.816 --> 02:06:43.477]  There's no signs of heat.
[02:06:44.537 --> 02:06:54.660]  There's no signs of fire, there's still red paint on the beam, and it's identified as, there's a big old number 79 that they spray painted on the side of it.
[02:06:54.660 --> 02:07:02.802]  And I guess my question for you... Well, I would think if they're going to release a beam, they'd sanitize it and make sure it didn't have anything incriminating, but they do make mistakes.
[02:07:02.802 --> 02:07:05.283]  Most of it, all of it that I knew of was hauled off.
[02:07:05.924 --> 02:07:08.647]  I know about the beam up at College Station.
[02:07:08.647 --> 02:07:10.049]  Okay, I understand that.
[02:07:10.049 --> 02:07:16.899]  Can you go to PrisonPlanet.com, it says contact webmaster, email that to Paul and write us a brief description, we'll post it.
[02:07:17.523 --> 02:07:19.705]  Okay, and I will also send you some pictures.
[02:07:19.705 --> 02:07:27.370]  You would have had them by now, but I wanted to get a close-up of the... Well, why don't you start... Do you know how to... Is it a digital camera or film?
[02:07:27.370 --> 02:07:27.951]  No, it's not.
[02:07:27.951 --> 02:07:28.571]  No, it's not.
[02:07:28.571 --> 02:07:29.031]  It's 35mm.
[02:07:29.031 --> 02:07:31.373]  Do you know how to scan those?
[02:07:31.373 --> 02:07:32.434]  I don't have a scanner.
[02:07:32.434 --> 02:07:33.394]  I probably could.
[02:07:33.394 --> 02:07:34.816]  I bet your neighbor does.
[02:07:34.816 --> 02:07:36.056]  I bet you can scan them.
[02:07:36.056 --> 02:07:37.017]  I will try to do that.
[02:07:37.017 --> 02:07:40.259]  Well, just mail them and make sure it's got a note with it.
[02:07:40.259 --> 02:07:42.101]  Okay, excellent.
[02:07:42.101 --> 02:07:42.781]  Okay, let me get a...
[02:07:44.938 --> 02:07:46.799]  I'm sorry, what did you say, Mr. Rodriguez?
[02:07:46.799 --> 02:07:49.961]  Anything, anything, because we'll scan it for him.
[02:07:49.961 --> 02:07:51.122]  Okay, okay.
[02:07:51.122 --> 02:07:53.224]  Have you heard of any other beans on display?
[02:07:53.224 --> 02:07:55.025]  I haven't, no.
[02:07:55.025 --> 02:07:58.968]  There's, there's, there's, there's beans all over the nation.
[02:07:58.968 --> 02:08:05.772]  They send beans, we have in New Jersey, we have in Pennsylvania, we have in California.
[02:08:05.772 --> 02:08:07.293]  And these are a little propaganda.
[02:08:07.293 --> 02:08:08.054]  Everywhere.
[02:08:08.054 --> 02:08:09.255]  Yes, exactly.
[02:08:09.255 --> 02:08:13.938]  And they say that it was, they believe it was from Tower Number 2 and was found over a block away.
[02:08:14.403 --> 02:08:18.324]  Forty feet underground.
[02:08:18.324 --> 02:08:20.645]  And I will tell you, don't even believe that.
[02:08:20.645 --> 02:08:22.265]  Hold on, one at a time.
[02:08:22.265 --> 02:08:23.025]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:08:23.025 --> 02:08:29.967]  I'm sorry, don't even believe that, because once the building collapsed, the bees don't have a number.
[02:08:29.967 --> 02:08:34.428]  Like, this belongs to building number one, building number two.
[02:08:34.428 --> 02:08:37.349]  They're just, you know, giving information that is incorrect.
[02:08:37.349 --> 02:08:38.309]  Correct.
[02:08:38.309 --> 02:08:39.349]  Go ahead.
[02:08:42.006 --> 02:08:43.908]  Greg, comments?
[02:08:43.908 --> 02:08:47.011]  Not specifically on the beams, no.
[02:08:47.011 --> 02:08:54.479]  There's still concrete in the beam and like I say, the red paint is still there with a few scratches on it and that's it.
[02:08:54.479 --> 02:08:58.423]  It does refer to an explosion on the small temporary plaque.
[02:08:58.863 --> 02:09:00.524]  It's inside the display.
[02:09:00.524 --> 02:09:04.127]  It explains the explosion of 9-1-1.
[02:09:04.127 --> 02:09:06.788]  It's not the collapse, it's the explosion.
[02:09:06.788 --> 02:09:10.811]  And I tried to take a close-up picture of the plaque, and it turned out fuzzy.
[02:09:10.811 --> 02:09:16.615]  So I'm going to try to go back up and write it myself or try to get a better picture, but I will get that to you, Alex.
[02:09:16.615 --> 02:09:16.975]  Alright, Don.
[02:09:16.975 --> 02:09:18.056]  Don, thank you.
[02:09:18.056 --> 02:09:19.497]  Very nice of you.
[02:09:19.497 --> 02:09:23.439]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Annette.
[02:09:23.439 --> 02:09:25.921]  Annette, where are you calling us from today?
[02:09:26.587 --> 02:09:28.669]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:31.632]  I have some additional information... Annette, where are you calling us from?
[02:09:31.632 --> 02:09:32.733]  Oh, West Virginia.
[02:09:32.733 --> 02:09:33.073]  Welcome.
[02:09:33.073 --> 02:09:33.774]  Thank you for calling.
[02:09:33.774 --> 02:09:34.234]  Go ahead.
[02:09:34.234 --> 02:09:35.716]  You're welcome.
[02:09:35.716 --> 02:09:42.582]  I have some additional information with reference to the Janet C. Whalen interview by the Power Hour this morning.
[02:09:42.582 --> 02:09:50.710]  She brought out that while they have been putting T-valves in the water system to monitor individual buildings,
[02:09:51.210 --> 02:10:06.424]  Now they have new ones which they're replacing the old ones with computerized T-valves so that you can add individually to each building whatever you want to besides water.
[02:10:07.418 --> 02:10:19.510]  So bringing total control in where they can, and we have official government plans that have been declassified of springs, cities with knockout gas, the government putting stuff in the water supply, so I guess that's what the caller was mentioning?
[02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:24.235]  Yes, and she gave her email as Janet C.
[02:10:25.348 --> 02:10:32.013]  Phalen, P-H-A-L-E-N, the number 10, at yahoo.com.
[02:10:32.013 --> 02:10:33.233]  Yeah, we got that part.
[02:10:33.233 --> 02:10:33.894]  Oh, I see.
[02:10:33.894 --> 02:10:37.396]  And so what can we, I mean, what was the specifics of the story?
[02:10:37.396 --> 02:10:50.485]  Well, that was the specifics, that she was immediately, well she resigned because they made it very clear they didn't want her around in the public, the water department.
[02:10:51.165 --> 02:10:52.946]  On the West Coast.
[02:10:52.946 --> 02:10:55.307]  I'm not sure of the particular area.
[02:10:55.307 --> 02:11:05.693]  Okay, so a water... You know, I've just got to find out about this specifically instead of the... It's kind of... It'll turn into rumors and then, you know... I'll just have to call David Joyce myself and ask him, okay?
[02:11:05.693 --> 02:11:06.473]  Yeah, surely.
[02:11:06.473 --> 02:11:08.414]  Thank you for the call.
[02:11:08.414 --> 02:11:10.536]  Who's up next here?
[02:11:10.536 --> 02:11:11.876]  Mike in New York, you're on the air.
[02:11:11.876 --> 02:11:13.417]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:11:13.417 --> 02:11:13.997]  Hi, thanks.
[02:11:13.997 --> 02:11:17.099]  Yeah, deductive reasoning tells you they blew these buildings up.
[02:11:17.099 --> 02:11:18.560]  Here's a question for Mr. Rodriguez.
[02:11:19.668 --> 02:11:28.034]  Uh, we're told that the security firm in charge of the World Trade Center complex, up and through September 10th, was headed up by Marvin Bush, President Bush's brother.
[02:11:28.034 --> 02:11:30.215]  His mother admits that.
[02:11:30.215 --> 02:11:33.077]  It's been in major newspapers.
[02:11:33.077 --> 02:11:41.563]  The story first surfaced when Mommy Bush, in her book, Reflections, in her autobiography, bragged about it, how brave he was.
[02:11:41.563 --> 02:11:44.025]  Comments, gentlemen, both of you?
[02:11:44.025 --> 02:11:44.545]  Go ahead, William.
[02:11:44.545 --> 02:11:45.406]  Do you know anything about that?
[02:11:46.434 --> 02:11:55.760]  Well, I heard so many stories about it, and again, you know, we could not continue checking every single angle, because there's so many angles that we have here in New York.
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:12:01.163]  Well, several major newspapers did a report, it's true.
[02:12:01.163 --> 02:12:03.544]  Yeah, no, no, it's true, that's what we heard.
[02:12:03.544 --> 02:12:15.171]  But again, we have been bombarded, and now, just to remind the people, in New York, we're on the news practically almost every day, twice a week, minimum, because everything is 9-11 here.
[02:12:16.472 --> 02:12:28.337]  And, uh, we are floated with so much information... Well, sir, when you're on the street talking to people, I mean, do most New Yorkers reflect the Zogby Poll, believing there's government involvement?
[02:12:28.337 --> 02:12:29.058]  Oh, yes.
[02:12:29.058 --> 02:12:29.678]  Oh, yes.
[02:12:29.678 --> 02:12:30.318]  Oh, yes.
[02:12:30.318 --> 02:12:33.560]  And the Zogby Poll was actually commissioned by Jimmy Walter.
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:36.361]  And people... I mean, when you're talking to New Yorkers on the street, what do they say?
[02:12:37.688 --> 02:12:39.589]  They don't believe the official story.
[02:12:39.589 --> 02:12:52.876]  This is incredible that the majority of the people like, I mean, the common sense, they said common sense, is that, number one, the biggest nation in the world in terms of security.
[02:12:52.876 --> 02:12:54.797]  Every single agency failed continuously.
[02:12:54.797 --> 02:12:55.517]  We'll be right back.
[02:12:55.517 --> 02:12:55.998]  Stay with us.
[02:12:55.998 --> 02:12:59.199]  We've got a break.
[02:12:59.199 --> 02:13:02.061]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:13:02.799 --> 02:13:04.281]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:13:04.281 --> 02:13:10.308]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:13:10.308 --> 02:13:15.855]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:13:15.855 --> 02:13:19.980]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:24.224]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:13:24.224 --> 02:13:28.948]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:13:28.948 --> 02:13:32.010]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.

[02:16:23.167 --> 02:16:26.590]  And on the internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:16:26.590 --> 02:16:35.659]  Before we go back to our guest, we'll take a few final calls for Greg Zeminski and of course, one of the heroes of 9-11, William Rodriguez.
[02:16:37.325 --> 02:16:41.732]  I believe it's already sold out, the showing tonight for Marshall Law in South Lamar.
[02:16:41.732 --> 02:16:48.142]  And I did just get word, because I'd asked for that earlier, thank you, I'd forgotten to ask about it.
[02:16:48.142 --> 02:16:49.344]  Yes, it sold out.
[02:16:49.344 --> 02:16:50.346]  Did they say when it sold out?
[02:16:52.077 --> 02:16:53.979]  Probably sold out yesterday.
[02:16:53.979 --> 02:16:56.342]  I knew it was close to selling out yesterday.
[02:16:56.342 --> 02:17:00.366]  But usually 5-10 people don't show up who buy tickets online.
[02:17:00.366 --> 02:17:02.729]  And you can usually get in.
[02:17:02.729 --> 02:17:04.370]  You show up right when it's starting.
[02:17:04.370 --> 02:17:07.954]  And they tend to, it's really a bigger, it's like a 230 theater.
[02:17:07.954 --> 02:17:08.975]  But they only sell like 215.
[02:17:08.975 --> 02:17:11.398]  They usually hold back a few.
[02:17:11.398 --> 02:17:14.001]  So if you live in the area, I don't want you to waste your time if you don't live in the area.
[02:17:14.461 --> 02:17:17.042]  You're probably driving and maybe still get in.
[02:17:17.042 --> 02:17:18.543]  I hate to have you stand in line.
[02:17:18.543 --> 02:17:22.224]  But 8 o'clock tonight, last showing, at least for a while, of Martial Law.
[02:17:22.224 --> 02:17:23.444]  I want to thank all the folks that are coming.

[02:17:32.488 --> 02:17:34.228]  I mean, you know, it's not hype, folks.
[02:17:34.228 --> 02:17:36.089]  You've heard the reviews by others.
[02:17:36.089 --> 02:17:37.230]  I mean, it is powerful.

[02:18:02.059 --> 02:18:05.981]  All my films, books, a bunch of other films, my weekly TV show, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:18:07.356 --> 02:18:15.040]  Because we're going to run out of time, but first I want to thank William Rodriguez, survivor of 9-11, hero of 9-11, who heard the bombs going off.
[02:18:15.040 --> 02:18:18.542]  I want to thank Greg Zemensky for his tireless effort to expose this.
[02:18:18.542 --> 02:18:20.203]  But let's take a few final calls.
[02:18:20.203 --> 02:18:23.105]  Mike in New York, you've got 30 seconds to finish up, then I'm going to Brian.
[02:18:23.585 --> 02:18:34.228]  Yep, the reason why I asked is because I'm wondering if Mr. Rodriguez has any information or if he knows if anybody has information about an increased activity by that security firm or even private contractors coming in to do wiring.
[02:18:34.228 --> 02:18:34.949]  Thanks for the call.
[02:18:34.949 --> 02:18:43.311]  Yeah, the question is, we heard reports of different floors being shut down for construction and maintenance and drills evacuating the building three times a month before 9-11.
[02:18:43.311 --> 02:18:44.652]  Mr. Rodriguez?
[02:18:44.652 --> 02:18:46.272]  True.
[02:18:46.272 --> 02:18:46.913]  You said true.
[02:18:46.913 --> 02:18:48.153]  Give us details, please.
[02:18:49.059 --> 02:18:55.242]  Well, actually, the building only have drills twice a year, which is stupid.
[02:18:55.242 --> 02:19:02.005]  A building that high should have been having drills maybe once a month.
[02:19:02.005 --> 02:19:08.367]  There was an increase of security and then a decrease of security.
[02:19:08.367 --> 02:19:16.251]  They were having shutdown, electrical shutdown in the building prior to 9-11, supposedly to test
[02:19:16.863 --> 02:19:18.864]  They shut down some of the floors too?
[02:19:18.864 --> 02:19:19.424]  Ah, very convenient.
[02:19:19.424 --> 02:19:22.406]  Let's go ahead and make a final call.
[02:19:22.406 --> 02:19:23.426]  Brian, Indiana, quickly.
[02:19:23.426 --> 02:19:24.027]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:19:43.277 --> 02:19:51.545]  Yeah, I know Alex, before you talked about that, firefighters were told not to talk in fear of their families and stuff like that.
[02:19:51.545 --> 02:19:55.789]  I wonder if Mr. Rodriguez had to contact any of these people post 9-11.
[02:19:55.789 --> 02:20:00.133]  Have you been told by folks that were told to, well he did say they were told to shut up, but was anybody threatened?
[02:20:01.511 --> 02:20:03.692]  Well, it's not threatened directly.
[02:20:03.692 --> 02:20:05.512]  They do it in a subtle way.
[02:20:05.512 --> 02:20:14.235]  And it's basically that they tell you not to get into those issues because you're going to get problems with the CIA, the FBI, or everybody involved.
[02:20:14.235 --> 02:20:14.915]  Well, that is a threat.
[02:20:14.915 --> 02:20:16.015]  So it's better for you to keep quiet.
[02:20:16.015 --> 02:20:16.435]  All right.
[02:20:16.435 --> 02:20:18.236]  Well, Mr. Rod, go ahead.
[02:20:20.206 --> 02:20:29.134]  I want to say thank you for having me on the show, and thank you for Greg who invited me to actually meet you, and you can count on me on any event.
[02:20:29.134 --> 02:20:30.035]  Well, God bless you.
[02:20:30.035 --> 02:20:31.016]  I will be available.
[02:20:31.016 --> 02:20:32.757]  Listen, Greg, thanks for coming on, too.
[02:20:32.757 --> 02:20:33.778]  Hey, thank you, Alex.
[02:20:33.778 --> 02:20:34.819]  I really enjoy it.
[02:20:34.819 --> 02:20:35.960]  Take care, my friend.
[02:20:35.960 --> 02:20:38.602]  God bless.
[02:20:38.602 --> 02:20:40.384]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family.
