[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:27.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  Welcome, friends. It is Friday, December 28, 2012.
[00:31.000 --> 00:34.000]  This is Mike Adams sitting in for Alex Jones.
[00:34.000 --> 00:39.000]  You are listening to the Alex Jones Show, and for the next three hours, we will be broadcasting live,
[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000]  bringing you the latest red alerts on all fronts.
[00:43.000 --> 00:50.000]  We've got, of course, the First Amendment under attack right now through Facebook and social media censorship.
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.000]  That story, more details will be coming out here today.
[00:53.000 --> 01:02.000]  We've got the Second Amendment under major assault now through Senator Feinstein's efforts to try to confiscate all guns,
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  or for you to register your guns with your fingerprints and the serial numbers of all the guns.
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  So gun confiscation is upon us in America today.
[01:13.000 --> 01:17.000]  We've got Alex Jones himself will be in studio in two and a half hours,
[01:17.000 --> 01:24.000]  but until then, we're going to be interviewing Lenny McGill, the founder of Glockstore.com in California,
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  with his comments on gun confiscation, gun control, Senator Feinstein's.
[01:30.000 --> 01:32.000]  Can you even call it a proposal?
[01:32.000 --> 01:34.000]  It's really just a piece of insanity.
[01:34.000 --> 01:37.000]  But anyway, he'll be joining us to talk about that.
[01:37.000 --> 01:44.000]  We've also got Kelly O'Mara, the author of Psyched Out, joining us to talk about the dangers of psychiatric drugs
[01:44.000 --> 01:49.000]  and the links between those psyched drugs and violent behavior and school shootings.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  It turns out most of these shooters are on these psychiatric drugs.
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  And of course, you've heard about the psychiatric industry here on Infowars before.
[01:58.000 --> 02:00.000]  We're going to go over that in more detail today.
[02:00.000 --> 02:07.000]  Doug Hagman is also going to be joining us in the third hour today with additional details from the intelligence community.
[02:07.000 --> 02:10.000]  A lot of breaking news is happening there.
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  Yesterday on the show, you heard about ammo stockpiling around the country.
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.000]  The US government, of course, has purchased 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition to be used domestically,
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  including 40 caliber hollow point rounds.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.000]  That was covered by Infowars earlier in the year.
[02:27.000 --> 02:30.000]  Those also include sniper rounds that are now being stockpiled.
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.000]  We confirmed yesterday here on the show stockpiled at ammo depots around the country.
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  And it is now becoming very clear that that ammunition is to be used to kill Americans,
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  to kill American patriots, American veterans, soldiers, and anybody else
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  that the globalists can eliminate by causing a civil war.
[02:53.000 --> 02:58.000]  So on this day, we are facing a very dark future.
[02:58.000 --> 03:01.000]  And we're going to bring you all those details here as the show unfolds.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  We've also got some other breaking news and we've also got some solutions.
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  So I know that this is a dark hour for America, but we've got some good news.
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  We've got some solutions. I'll be breaking those down for you as we continue with this show.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  And by the way, one of those pieces of good news is the fact that Senator Feinstein,
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  by just showing her cards and saying it is about gun confiscation.
[03:25.000 --> 03:30.000]  It is about nationwide gun registration, just like Adolf Hitler did in the 1930s.
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  It is about fingerprinting you and building a government list of who owns your guns.
[03:35.000 --> 03:41.000]  By her putting that out yesterday, now all of those people who once thought
[03:41.000 --> 03:47.000]  that any talk of gun confiscation was conspiracy theory, they now are awakening.
[03:47.000 --> 03:53.000]  Yes, thank you, Feinstein, for awakening tens of millions of patriots to reality,
[03:53.000 --> 03:56.000]  which is that they are coming for your guns.
[03:56.000 --> 03:59.000]  They're going to destroy your First Amendment, your Second Amendment,
[03:59.000 --> 04:03.000]  is already destroyed thanks to the TSA at the airports.
[04:03.000 --> 04:05.000]  They're coming for everything.
[04:05.000 --> 04:11.000]  So we've got all of that news, plus a lot more straight ahead, including there is,
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  teachers in Utah are now being given firearms training to carry concealed weapons
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  to help protect children in the schools there in Utah.
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  We've got also, check this out, the dead body of Adam Lanza,
[04:24.000 --> 04:31.000]  the supposed shooter at Sandy Hook, is now being harvested by scientists
[04:31.000 --> 04:40.000]  to create DNA profiling so that you can be labeled evil if you share DNA with that shooter.
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000]  That's how insane things are getting now in America.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  All of that news, much more, plus those guests and your calls coming up right here
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  on the Alex Jones Show, stay with us, we'll be right back after this break
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  with all those details and much more. Stay with us.

[08:13.000 --> 08:16.000]  Alright, welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[08:16.000 --> 08:21.000]  This is Friday, December 28th, 2012. Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, editor of
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  naturalnews.com, filling in for Alex today for the first two and a half hours.
[08:25.000 --> 08:28.000]  Alex will be joining us, taking over the studio.
[08:28.000 --> 08:30.000]  It is his studio.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  So he'll be here in two and a half hours to continue the show and go into overdrive.
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  And he's going to be interviewing Doug Hagman during that segment
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  and also offering some additional commentary.
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  Now, obviously, if you're just joining us, we are at red alert levels everywhere
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  across America.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  The assault on our liberties, our freedoms, our Constitution, our Bill of Rights
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  is intense.
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  It has never been more intense.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  The situation has never been more dire.
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.000]  But there is a real justification for hope for solutions
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  because so many Americans are already armed.
[09:08.000 --> 09:13.000]  And I mean law abiding Americans, police officers, returning military veterans,
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  active duty veterans, farmers, ranchers, Second Amendment supporters,
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  competition shooters, people who just enjoy the hobby of shooting,
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  they are armed like never before.
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  And in fact, one of the most important realizations in all of this is that
[09:30.000 --> 09:35.000]  since the Sandy Hook shooting, which itself has all sorts of questions,
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  for example, there's a video we're going to run later, guys,
[09:38.000 --> 09:44.000]  show news announcing that the AR-15 Bushmaster was actually left in the car,
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  wasn't even involved in the shooting.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  So that hoax that this was a, quote, assault rifle massacre,
[09:51.000 --> 09:53.000]  we're going to expose that right here.
[09:53.000 --> 09:57.000]  It was actually carried out with handguns, not AR-15s.
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.000]  But one of the things that happened in the aftermath of that shooting is that
[10:02.000 --> 10:08.000]  it looks like about 10 million firearms are newly in possession of law abiding
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  American people since that shooting because there was such a mad rush
[10:12.000 --> 10:17.000]  to go out and buy AR-15s, to go out and buy bolt action rifles
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  and handguns and shotguns and everything you can imagine.
[10:19.000 --> 10:28.000]  So the media, by hyping this up and engaging in their emotional fear manipulation campaign,
[10:28.000 --> 10:34.000]  they have actually succeeded in arming America to the teeth, which is good.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  It's good for patriots because it means more distribution of power,
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  less of a risk of a monopoly of violence in the hands of the government alone.
[10:43.000 --> 10:47.000]  We've got more firearms in the hands of people and also ammunition.
[10:47.000 --> 10:54.000]  Have you noticed that you can't buy magazines or ammunition now just about anywhere?
[10:54.000 --> 11:02.000]  Try all the online websites, Ammo to Go, MidwayUSA, Brownells, all the sites,
[11:02.000 --> 11:09.000]  Cabela's, you name it, they're all completely wiped out of virtually every piece of ammunition
[11:09.000 --> 11:11.000]  that existed in the supply line.
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  Which means that, and by my estimates, by the way, 10 million firearms were sold
[11:17.000 --> 11:22.000]  and a billion rounds of ammo were put in the hands of law abiding citizens all across America.
[11:22.000 --> 11:31.000]  Now, the government, of course, has stockpiled 1.6 billion rounds of ammo over the last year or so.
[11:31.000 --> 11:35.000]  And that's been covered here on InfoWars.
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.000]  And most of those rounds are designated for domestic use against the American people.
[11:41.000 --> 11:45.000]  So now we know, now we know, thank you, Feinstein, for showing your cards.
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.000]  Now we know what that ammo is truly for.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  It's not a conspiracy theory to say they're coming after your guns.
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  It's not a conspiracy theory to say that ammunition is being stockpiled to be used against the American people.
[11:58.000 --> 12:03.000]  We now know that that is fact because those are hollow point rounds.
[12:03.000 --> 12:05.000]  You can't use them in wartime.
[12:05.000 --> 12:07.000]  It's a violation of the Geneva Convention.
[12:07.000 --> 12:13.000]  They're mostly 40 caliber hollow points, which is not even used by most soldiers.
[12:13.000 --> 12:21.000]  They tend to use 9mm, for example, NATO sizes, NATO calibers, and they also include sniper rounds.
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  So here's a cartoon that we just released last night.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  Counterthink cartoon.
[12:27.000 --> 12:29.000]  I'm the creator of that series.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  But the cartoon is called Guns Are Bad.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  Now, I know those of you listening on the radio can't see this, but you can.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  I believe this is posted on Infowars.com.
[12:36.000 --> 12:38.000]  But let me just describe it to you.
[12:38.000 --> 12:46.000]  It's got Obama standing on top of a massive pile, a massive mountain of firearms and guns,
[12:46.000 --> 12:55.000]  and ammo boxes labeled DEA, TSA, ATF, DHS, and other agency names.
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  And it's got Obama pointing down from his mountain of firearms,
[13:00.000 --> 13:06.000]  pointing down at a farmer holding a ranch rifle, screaming, guns are bad.
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  So this cartoon, which obviously I encourage you to just share this posted anywhere you want.
[13:12.000 --> 13:13.000]  Get the message out there.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  This shows the hypocrisy of the government saying, you can't have guns.
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  You, the people, can't have guns because we have them all.
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  We want to have them all.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  We have 1.6 billion rounds of ammo.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  We have all the advanced weaponry and full auto firearms in the hands of government,
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  even though most American citizens only own semi-auto firearms.
[13:34.000 --> 13:39.000]  So the government already has a great imbalance of power in that realm of firearms,
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  but it wants to make that complete, hence, hence the gun confiscation.
[13:44.000 --> 13:51.000]  Now, do you guys have that video ready about that assault rifle being left in the car?
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  All right, let's run that because I want to get this point out there.
[13:55.000 --> 14:00.000]  This shooting in Sandy Hook was not carried out with a Bushmaster AR-15.
[14:00.000 --> 14:03.000]  It was carried out only with handguns.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  And why are there four handguns?
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  Because there were at least two people, folks.
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  I'm telling you, human beings don't have four arms unless you're eating genetically modified corn.
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.000]  You can't fire four handguns all at once.
[14:15.000 --> 14:18.000]  It, it's almost proof that there was more than one shooter involved,
[14:18.000 --> 14:20.000]  but let's go ahead and roll that video.
[14:20.000 --> 14:21.000]  It's only a minute and something.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  Go ahead. Let's take a look.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  Bill Williams, our Chief Justice Correspondent, has got some new information as well.
[14:25.000 --> 14:26.000]  Pete, good morning.
[14:26.000 --> 14:28.000]  Matt, good morning to you.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  This continues to be a very complex investigation.
[14:32.000 --> 14:34.000]  There's a lot of contradictory information out there,
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  but there is some new information this morning from a couple of federal officials and state officials.
[14:39.000 --> 14:46.000]  They say now that there were actually four handguns recovered inside the school,
[14:46.000 --> 14:55.000]  not just two, as we were initially told, four handguns and apparently only handguns that were taken into the school.
[14:55.000 --> 15:04.000]  We knew that Adam Lanza, the man said to be the gunman here, also had a assault-style AR-15-style rifle
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  that he had taken to the school that was in the car he drove there, his mother's car.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  In the car.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  But we were told by several officials that he left that in the car.
[15:13.000 --> 15:15.000]  We're also told that on the 11th of December.
[15:15.000 --> 15:18.000]  Well, there you go. That's all we need to hear. He left the AR-15 in the car.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  It was not used in the shooting.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  That right there from NBC News, and there you go.
[15:23.000 --> 15:28.000]  But that's never going to be talked about in the mainstream media ever again,
[15:28.000 --> 15:33.000]  because they've decided to go with the lone gunman theory and the AR-15 Bushmaster theory
[15:33.000 --> 15:41.000]  so that people like Feinstein, the most wretched evil witch to ever set foot on the floor of the U.S. Senate,
[15:41.000 --> 15:46.000]  in my opinion, so that she can then call for the mass disarmament of the American people,
[15:46.000 --> 15:52.000]  first starting with gun registration and then, of course, inevitably ending up in gun confiscation.
[15:52.000 --> 16:01.000]  Now, there is a new petition that has been launched by Infowars to try Dianne Feinstein for treason.
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  Paul Joseph Watson has a story now posted on Infowars.com.
[16:06.000 --> 16:12.000]  The latest White House petition garnering attention demands that Senator Feinstein be tried in federal court
[16:12.000 --> 16:21.000]  for treason against the Constitution for her role in introducing legislation that would go a long way to repealing the Second Amendment.
[16:21.000 --> 16:28.000]  Now, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but I urge you to go to Infowars.com.
[16:28.000 --> 16:34.000]  This is the top article, and you need to sign this petition.
[16:34.000 --> 16:38.000]  Don't be afraid of signing the petition thinking, oh, they're going to find out who we are.
[16:38.000 --> 16:40.000]  They already know who you are, okay?
[16:40.000 --> 16:47.000]  They've got all your tax records, all your property records, all your instant background, NICS, FBI, gun purchase records.
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  They've already got that. Sign the petition, send a message.
[16:51.000 --> 16:56.000]  Now, obviously, they're probably, at least in this administration, never going to charge Feinstein for treason,
[16:56.000 --> 17:02.000]  but just having a lot of people sign the petition makes waves throughout the media.
[17:02.000 --> 17:12.000]  And if there is a collapse and a new society that comes out of it, perhaps a new society based on the Constitution,
[17:12.000 --> 17:19.000]  imagine that, then it is very feasible that people like Feinstein could be tried for treason,
[17:19.000 --> 17:25.000]  and that others who are involved in the deliberate destruction of the Second Amendment and the Bill of Rights
[17:25.000 --> 17:31.000]  could be arrested and prosecuted for their crimes against the American people and the Constitution.
[17:31.000 --> 17:35.000]  So this is not simply theater.
[17:35.000 --> 17:43.000]  This is a very serious issue, and anyone who goes out like Feinstein and attempts to destroy the Second Amendment
[17:43.000 --> 17:50.000]  and the Bill of Rights and take away these freedoms and liberties that the American people have fought and died for in previous generations,
[17:50.000 --> 17:55.000]  those people, those people that try to take these rights, in my view, they are criminals,
[17:55.000 --> 18:01.000]  and they need to be arrested and tried for their crimes against America.
[18:01.000 --> 18:11.000]  Now, getting back to the shooting, the DNA of the Sandy Hook killer Adam Lanza is now being harvested from his dead body to...
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.000]  You're not going to believe this. You're not going to believe this. This is off the charts.
[18:14.000 --> 18:23.000]  They're going to take his DNA, and they're going to then genetically profile everyone that they can then label as being a future killer
[18:23.000 --> 18:27.000]  if they share any DNA with Adam Lanza.
[18:27.000 --> 18:37.000]  They're going to harvest DNA from his dead body and use it to label you a potential future killer if you have common genetic traits.
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.000]  That is a story from Mail Online in the UK, and scientists are working on this.
[18:42.000 --> 18:45.000]  Again, this is the kind of tyranny we are dealing with.
[18:45.000 --> 18:54.000]  So now, not only are all gun owners supposedly evil, but if you even share a genetic code with Adam Lanza,
[18:54.000 --> 19:01.000]  and the point is that 99.8% of all human genetic code is identical anyway.
[19:01.000 --> 19:05.000]  So you already share genetic code with Adam Lanza.
[19:05.000 --> 19:13.000]  Senator Feinstein shares genetic code with Adam Lanza and probably some lizard people, as well.
[19:13.000 --> 19:15.000]  Let's get David Ike to comment on that.
[19:15.000 --> 19:23.000]  But for sure, she shares genetic code with Adam Lanza as do you, as does every human being on the planet.
[19:23.000 --> 19:28.000]  So this is the latest example of scientific tyranny, scientific dictatorship,
[19:28.000 --> 19:34.000]  to be able to say that anyone, anyone could be a future killer.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  This is pre-crime. These are thought crimes.
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000]  The hammer is being dropped, like just out of a dystopian sci-fi fiction film,
[19:42.000 --> 19:48.000]  where if you are even born with some of this DNA, you are immediately labeled a terrorist,
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  and you could be sent to prison just based on your genetic profile.
[19:52.000 --> 19:58.000]  That's what America has come to. Stay with us. We'll be right back with more right here on The Alex Jones Show.
[20:23.000 --> 20:27.000]  It's time to get your own supply from EatFoodsDirect.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  I know I won't be standing in a bread line trading my freedom for food.
[20:31.000 --> 20:35.000]  I'm taking control of my future, and you're nuts if you don't do the same.

[21:24.000 --> 21:32.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[21:32.000 --> 21:38.000]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[21:42.000 --> 21:47.000]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[23:59.000 --> 24:15.000]  All right, listen up folks. This is the Alex Jones Show. Mike Adams, the health ranger, filming in for Alex today.
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  Wearing the Infowars Bullhorn shirt. I hope you can see that there.
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.000]  For those of you watching on PrismPlan.tv, you have a great selection of shirts in the warehouse back there.
[24:25.000 --> 24:34.000]  InfowarsStore.com, right? Yeah. Okay, InfowarsStore.com where you can find all this great gear.
[24:34.000 --> 24:42.000]  Now, this is the most important segment that I'll probably talk about today. Listen, we have a solution for some of this.
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.000]  But to understand that, we got to talk about the Facebook censorship that happened yesterday.
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.000]  Facebook has gone on a massive purge of all political speech that it does not agree with.
[24:52.000 --> 25:00.000]  This is a shutdown, a disabling of dozens of accounts of people who are posting political speech.
[25:00.000 --> 25:08.000]  The Bill of Rights, the architects and engineers for 9-11 Truth, I think their account was shut down yesterday.
[25:08.000 --> 25:12.000]  Some of these accounts may be back on, including ours is back on today.
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  But we were given a final warning too after posting our Gandhi quote, which made news yesterday.
[25:17.000 --> 25:21.000]  Where is my Gandhi quote? Anyway, I'll find it.
[25:21.000 --> 25:26.000]  But the Gandhi quote, oh, you have it right there. Thank you.
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.000]  Here it is. We posted this picture of Gandhi saying this quote,
[25:31.000 --> 25:40.000]  among the many misdeeds of British rule in India, history will look upon the act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest.
[25:40.000 --> 25:45.000]  And of course, by that he means the darkest. This is not about color.
[25:45.000 --> 25:51.000]  That quote got us suspended on Facebook.
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  And we were just locked out. And I couldn't believe it.
[25:55.000 --> 26:03.000]  And it turns out there was a massive purge taking place all throughout the day of other accounts, 9-11 Truthers, Infowars, Writers and Employees.
[26:03.000 --> 26:08.000]  Most of their accounts got disabled, suspended, deactivated or shut down.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  The truth is what's coming, folks, is far worse.
[26:12.000 --> 26:17.000]  I don't believe there's going to be a day where Google will purge all websites that support the Second Amendment.
[26:17.000 --> 26:23.000]  I don't know for sure. That's just my belief that they are probably going to do that.
[26:23.000 --> 26:28.000]  I believe that even Twitter, which has so far recognized free speech,
[26:28.000 --> 26:35.000]  may shut down the speech of those who advocate gun ownership, lawful legal gun ownership,
[26:35.000 --> 26:40.000]  in the hands of law abiding citizens who complete background checks.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  I believe that there is a massive crackdown. Domain names are going to be seized.
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  DNS is going to be taken over by the UN.
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.000]  So there's a solution to that. And this is my red alert message to all programmers,
[26:52.000 --> 27:00.000]  to even hackers, even members of hacking communities that believe in liberty and freedom and underground information.
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  This is my message to you.
[27:02.000 --> 27:09.000]  We need to build a peer-to-peer news and content distribution system without a centralized server.
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.000]  I suspect out this project, and I can help oversee this project and I can help promote it,
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  and there is a revenue stream in it for anyone who can build this.
[27:18.000 --> 27:24.000]  It has to use port 80 traffic to look like regular HTTP web traffic.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  I'm not going to get too technical here, but I'm just throwing that out there.
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  It has to, again, not be centralized, and it will have different channels.
[27:32.000 --> 27:40.000]  And all of the patriot and freedom-oriented websites and individuals will be invited to have their own channels on the system,
[27:40.000 --> 27:48.000]  including people like Steve Quayle, Doug Hagman, Gerald Solente, Max Kaiser,
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.000]  and obviously Infowars and Natural News and others in that same realm.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  Maybe even Judge would want to use it.
[27:55.000 --> 28:02.000]  If you can build this, send an email to this address, p2p at naturalnews.com, okay?
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.000]  P2P, peer-to-peer, p2p at naturalnews.com.
[28:06.000 --> 28:08.000]  Get that email address out there.
[28:08.000 --> 28:14.000]  Send your contact information to us if you can build this or if you have a team who can build this.
[28:14.000 --> 28:21.000]  We can provide a small amount of seed money for this, but the real revenue stream will come when this is built and launched.
[28:21.000 --> 28:25.000]  Because, again, why is this a red alert? Why does this matter to everybody listening?
[28:25.000 --> 28:33.000]  They're going to shut down all the social networking of people who support the Second Amendment and the Bill of Rights and Liberty in America.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  They are going to seize the websites.
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  There will be a day, trust me, when Infowars.com will be seized and shut down.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  That day is coming.
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.000]  There will be a day when Natural News will be seized and shut down.
[28:44.000 --> 28:51.000]  We must have an alternate method to be able to reach people without going through the UN-controlled domain name server system.
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  This peer-to-peer technology is the way to do it.
[28:55.000 --> 29:04.000]  Look, I founded and grew a software company in the past to a multi-million dollar company that even sold to many Fortune 500 companies.
[29:04.000 --> 29:10.000]  I know technology. I know how to build this, and I know there are people here in this studio right here in Infowars who can help with this.
[29:10.000 --> 29:16.000]  Get the word out, again, peer-to-peer at naturalnews.com if you can help build this system.
[29:16.000 --> 29:24.000]  Now, with this, we will have an unstoppable, nonsensorable channel to get out information even during martial law.
[29:24.000 --> 29:27.000]  We will be able to get the word out to patriots.
[29:27.000 --> 29:35.000]  We will be able to get the truth out even as the White House is spreading lies and the mainstream media is spreading lies, which is virtually all it does these days.
[29:35.000 --> 29:38.000]  This is the solution. We can make this work.
[29:38.000 --> 29:46.000]  Stay with us much more straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show, including an upcoming interview with Lenny McGill from Glockstore.com about the gun control.
[29:46.000 --> 29:50.000]  Measure is put forth by the Wicked Feinstein. Stay with us.
[29:50.000 --> 30:09.000]  Stay with us. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[33:12.000 --> 33:21.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance.
[33:21.000 --> 33:27.000]  And we're back on the Alex Jones Show here on this Friday broadcasting live, December 28th, 2012.
[33:27.000 --> 33:32.000]  This is Mike Adams, The Health Ranger, filming in for Alex.
[33:32.000 --> 33:36.000]  I got to change my nickname, guys, I think because I pretty much just write about Liberty now.
[33:36.000 --> 33:39.000]  I think I got to be like the Liberty Ranger or something.
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  Health is great. It's a great topic.
[33:42.000 --> 33:44.000]  But if we don't have Liberty, we don't have health.
[33:44.000 --> 33:47.000]  And this is something that even some of my own readers don't understand yet.
[33:47.000 --> 33:52.000]  Most of them do, but if you don't, look, if you want to have health freedom,
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.000]  if you want to have farm freedom and food freedom where you can buy raw milk,
[33:56.000 --> 34:01.000]  let's say without being arrested, or where you can say no to their deadly aluminum,
[34:01.000 --> 34:07.000]  MSG, mercury-laden vaccines without being arrested and forcefully injected at gunpoint,
[34:07.000 --> 34:10.000]  you got to have Liberty, all right?
[34:10.000 --> 34:15.000]  Look, the Second Amendment is what makes possible every other freedom,
[34:15.000 --> 34:20.000]  including health freedom, medical freedom, food freedom, farm freedom, everything.
[34:20.000 --> 34:26.000]  So I'm going to have to get a new nickname, I guess, Liberty something.
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  All right, other news. Well, first of all, if you're just joining us,
[34:29.000 --> 34:33.000]  sign the petition to try Dianne Feinstein for treason, all right?
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  That's up on Infowars.com right now.
[34:35.000 --> 34:41.000]  This creature who is an admitted enemy of America,
[34:41.000 --> 34:44.000]  an enemy of the United States Constitution and the Bill of Rights,
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.000]  she is following in the footsteps of Adolf Hitler, probably her role model,
[34:49.000 --> 34:53.000]  to start with gun registration.
[34:53.000 --> 34:57.000]  And then once the government has a list of everybody who owns a gun,
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  they will, of course, have gun confiscation.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  Because, oh, you know how this will work is very simple.
[35:02.000 --> 35:06.000]  First of all, when this is being debated in the Senate, and that's coming up,
[35:06.000 --> 35:11.000]  they will simply stage another school shooting during the debate to drive home the votes.
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  That's easy for them to do, pull off another stage shooting
[35:14.000 --> 35:18.000]  or another stage bombing of a government building like Oklahoma City.
[35:18.000 --> 35:22.000]  And then everybody will vote for the gun registration law.
[35:22.000 --> 35:26.000]  So then all the Americans who are running around on this guilt trip,
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  because suddenly they feel guilty for the actions of one lone nut somewhere,
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  which wasn't even probably his doing.
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  It was probably a government group that did it.
[35:36.000 --> 35:38.000]  All these people will go ahead and register their guns
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  and their serial numbers and their home addresses.
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  So then the government will have this massive list.
[35:42.000 --> 35:45.000]  Oh, here's a list, a big database of everybody who owns a gun
[35:45.000 --> 35:48.000]  and exactly where they live and exactly what they own.
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  Well, then the government will stage another shooting.
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  And at that point, people like Michael Moore, the self-propelled food processing slug,
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  will say, oh, we already have a list of all the gun owners.
[35:59.000 --> 36:04.000]  Let's just have everybody now turn them in, gun confiscation.
[36:04.000 --> 36:07.000]  And anybody who doesn't turn them in will just be labeled a terrorist.
[36:07.000 --> 36:08.000]  And there you go.
[36:08.000 --> 36:11.000]  That's how it happens. That's how it happened in Australia.
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  That's how it happened in Ireland.
[36:13.000 --> 36:16.000]  That's how it happened similarly in Nazi Germany.
[36:16.000 --> 36:19.000]  And that's what's slated for America.
[36:19.000 --> 36:24.000]  But going against that, now helping to resist some of that madness,
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  is none other than Sheriff Arpaio,
[36:27.000 --> 36:34.000]  who is, of course, famous for investigating Obama's fake birth certificate.
[36:34.000 --> 36:38.000]  This is such a bad forgery. It's so bad.
[36:38.000 --> 36:43.000]  If I applied for a bank loan and submitted a document with that level of bad forgery,
[36:43.000 --> 36:47.000]  I would be arrested for a felony document forgery crime.
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  Believe me, it is so bad that the American people can't see that.
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  It's just amazing.
[36:52.000 --> 36:57.000]  But anyway, Sheriff Arpaio is sending an armed posse to protect schools.
[36:57.000 --> 37:06.000]  Finally, somebody in America is sending armed men to protect the children in the schools.
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  And even better, where's that news article?
[37:10.000 --> 37:13.000]  Darren McBrain found this today.
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.000]  Here it is in Utah.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  Let me get the right one here.
[37:19.000 --> 37:25.000]  Here it is. In Utah, they are giving concealed carry training to Utah teachers.
[37:25.000 --> 37:31.000]  They're going to get special firearms training and be allowed to carry concealed weapons in their classrooms.
[37:31.000 --> 37:35.000]  Imagine that. Imagine being able to shoot back.
[37:35.000 --> 37:40.000]  Oh my goodness. Look, the truth is, these school shooters,
[37:40.000 --> 37:44.000]  even when they are actually young kids who have been doped up on psychiatric drugs
[37:44.000 --> 37:49.000]  and who have been playing too many video games and they go in and actually shoot people,
[37:49.000 --> 37:54.000]  even when that happens, these kids commit suicide the minute they see somebody
[37:54.000 --> 37:56.000]  with an armed defense.
[37:56.000 --> 38:00.000]  They shoot themselves the moment a cop appears.
[38:00.000 --> 38:06.000]  And if a teacher just pulled out a Glock 19 or whatever,
[38:06.000 --> 38:10.000]  just pulled out a Glock 26, even a 9mm,
[38:10.000 --> 38:13.000]  and just started blasting away at one of these shooters,
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  a shooter would just turn around and kill himself instantly.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  The massacre is over. Done.
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  Children's lives would be saved.
[38:20.000 --> 38:24.000]  Turn that sucker, turn that school into a two-way shooting range is what you do.
[38:24.000 --> 38:29.000]  Two-way ranges don't last very long.
[38:29.000 --> 38:34.000]  Now, we've got actually an expert on all of this joining us now here on The Alex Jones Show.
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  His name is Lenny McGill.
[38:36.000 --> 38:42.000]  He is the founder of Glockstore.com and based in California.
[38:42.000 --> 38:48.000]  He is an outspoken advocate of lawful firearms ownership.
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.000]  Many of his customers are law enforcement and military.
[38:51.000 --> 38:57.000]  And he's made many videos, YouTube videos and DVDs and really knows his stuff.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  He's an expert marksman himself.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  And I've watched many of his videos.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  He's a very, very well-informed guy.
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.000]  And now he is living in California, the realm of Feinstein,
[39:08.000 --> 39:13.000]  the wicked witch of the West who is now trying to take our firearms.
[39:13.000 --> 39:16.000]  Lenny, welcome to The Alex Jones Show.
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  Thank you very much.
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  It's good to be here.
[39:19.000 --> 39:20.000]  Sorry, I'm a little bit late.
[39:20.000 --> 39:22.000]  The phones are just going crazy in our phone lines.
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.000]  Literally, we can barely get a line out, much less a line in.
[39:26.000 --> 39:28.000]  So it's been very, very busy.
[39:28.000 --> 39:29.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[39:29.000 --> 39:30.000]  I figured that was the case.
[39:30.000 --> 39:33.000]  Our producers were trying to get ahold of you and couldn't get through.
[39:33.000 --> 39:36.000]  But now that you know what's going on, well, first of all,
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  tell us what are people calling you?
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  What are they hammering you with today?
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  What are all the calls about?
[39:42.000 --> 39:47.000]  Lenny is in a panic situation to try to buy a firearm hand
[39:47.000 --> 39:55.000]  or a high-capacity magazine now before any legislation comes about.
[39:55.000 --> 39:58.000]  So in essence, what they've done, you know,
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  this government regulation is done,
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  and hopefully you can hear all that,
[40:03.000 --> 40:06.000]  but hopefully they're stimulating all these people
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  who always thought about buying a gun, always thought about it,
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  but it never really did until now the government says,
[40:12.000 --> 40:13.000]  oh, you can't have one.
[40:13.000 --> 40:16.000]  So the sales are just off the charts.
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  That's absolutely true.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  I remember, I actually, you may not even know,
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  I'm a customer of your store.
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  I actually purchased a Glock from you many months ago,
[40:24.000 --> 40:27.000]  and even then there was quite a wait time just because you do a lot of custom work.
[40:27.000 --> 40:32.000]  But what is, what happened after the media started calling for gun grabbing?
[40:32.000 --> 40:37.000]  What is your wait time now if somebody tries to order a custom Glock from you today?
[40:37.000 --> 40:40.000]  Well, we sell them both as a normal gun, you know,
[40:40.000 --> 40:41.000]  just the standard gun itself,
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  and we also do the custom work to them as well.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  The standard guns, we still have a fair supply of those.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  They are running very tight,
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.000]  so we can usually ship those out within two to three days.
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  The custom guns are anywhere from four to six or eight weeks.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  Oh, well, that's not bad these days,
[40:59.000 --> 41:03.000]  because I was talking to a gun shop here in Texas the other day,
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.000]  and they manufacture a very well-known, well, I'll just tell you, LaRue Tactical.
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.000]  You know, great, great, really high-end firearms,
[41:11.000 --> 41:17.000]  and I was asking them what was their wait time on firearms that were ordered last week.
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  And they told me, our only promise is that we're going to try to get
[41:22.000 --> 41:27.000]  all of the 2012 orders fulfilled by the end of 2013.
[41:27.000 --> 41:33.000]  Yeah, you know, the sales numbers went off the charts literally last weekend,
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.000]  and the phone has not stopped, and the orders have not stopped.
[41:36.000 --> 41:43.000]  So, you know, this pending legislation is creating a panic,
[41:43.000 --> 41:47.000]  and a panic buying spree that we've never seen before in the industry.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  Well, it's actually even achieving another form of gun control,
[41:49.000 --> 41:53.000]  because right now the wait time for a rifle is probably six months.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  I mean, effectively.
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.000]  You know, it's unfortunate, you know, I mean, this is the challenge
[41:59.000 --> 42:02.000]  with this whole legislation is, if anything, it really does come to pass,
[42:02.000 --> 42:07.000]  and then new laws are enacted, and draconian laws are not much less.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.000]  They're going to create this amazing, unbelievable sinister black market
[42:12.000 --> 42:15.000]  for the same product. It's not going to go away.
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.000]  Good point.
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  And they're going to create more crime and more criminals,
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  and everybody's going to be a criminal one way or another.
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  Yeah, it's like prohibition, but against guns.
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  Yeah, you're only going to create a black market.
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  You're going to have more violence, just like, you know, the Mexican drug gangs
[42:27.000 --> 42:30.000]  with the marijuana criminalization.
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  I don't really even know where you stand on that issue,
[42:32.000 --> 42:36.000]  but, you know, the drug war has not been successful.
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.000]  It's turned a lot of innocent people into criminals and filled the prisons.
[42:39.000 --> 42:45.000]  Well, and a lot of people have died, and it certainly hasn't decreased demand
[42:45.000 --> 42:48.000]  and availability in a sense.
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  You know, I mean, really, it's a terrible shame,
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  and then this is what's going to happen with the same thing with these laws.
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  They think they're going to pass it. They think they're going to really do something.
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  That's not even the problem with this whole thing.
[42:58.000 --> 43:01.000]  It's just an oppressive government action.
[43:01.000 --> 43:04.000]  You know, I mean, we first were faced with taxes, and then, you know, all these...
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  I mean, California this year, in 2013, there's 800 new laws.
[43:09.000 --> 43:13.000]  I mean, 800 more laws, you know, that literally anybody could be a criminal
[43:13.000 --> 43:15.000]  for just anything, you know, at this point.
[43:15.000 --> 43:18.000]  That's the 800 laws on top of everything else.
[43:18.000 --> 43:19.000]  It's insane.
[43:19.000 --> 43:25.000]  And have you read Senator Feinstein's proposal for her dream list of gun control measures?
[43:25.000 --> 43:31.000]  I did read over it, and it's hard to believe that, you know,
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  she feels that this is going to be the answer,
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  because what we're seeing with these mass murders in the last year,
[43:39.000 --> 43:42.000]  you know, you've got the guy in Colorado at the theater,
[43:42.000 --> 43:45.000]  you've got the kid out there in Tucson,
[43:45.000 --> 43:49.000]  and of course you've got this terrible tragedy up in Connecticut,
[43:49.000 --> 43:54.000]  is that every one of those people were diagnosed as mentally ill in some way or another.
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.000]  Every one of them were seeing a psychiatrist or a psychologist.
[43:57.000 --> 43:58.000]  Yes.
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.000]  And every one of them were being prescribed these psychopsychotic drugs
[44:01.000 --> 44:08.000]  that have a side effect of rage, aggression, suicidal and homicidal thoughts.
[44:08.000 --> 44:09.000]  Oh, you just nailed it.
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  But that's the issue that the mainstream media won't talk about.
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  They don't want to talk about mental health.
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  They don't really want to talk about the psychiatric drugs
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  and their links to violent outbursts,
[44:17.000 --> 44:21.000]  or the fact that most of these firearms were actually stolen to be used in the crimes.
[44:21.000 --> 44:27.000]  It's not like, in fact, Adam Lanza was denied the ability to purchase a rifle.
[44:27.000 --> 44:28.000]  Exactly.
[44:28.000 --> 44:29.000]  So the laws are working.
[44:29.000 --> 44:33.000]  But what's really the crime is this is the fact that these pharmaceutical companies
[44:33.000 --> 44:38.000]  are making billions of dollars selling these drugs,
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  and they know the side effects.
[44:40.000 --> 44:43.000]  They know the problem, and they don't publicize it,
[44:43.000 --> 44:47.000]  because they control the lobbyists with these billions of dollars,
[44:47.000 --> 44:48.000]  and they control the media.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  If you watch the mainstream network news,
[44:51.000 --> 44:52.000]  I mean, anybody can watch it.
[44:52.000 --> 44:55.000]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[44:55.000 --> 44:56.000]  Watch the news.
[44:56.000 --> 45:01.000]  How many advertisements are on the CBS and ABC News,
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.000]  nightly news that are pharmaceutical related?
[45:04.000 --> 45:05.000]  Oh, yeah.
[45:05.000 --> 45:06.000]  Over 50%.
[45:06.000 --> 45:09.000]  And they're telling you about drugs you need to take for diseases you didn't know yet.
[45:09.000 --> 45:12.000]  Well, diseases that don't even exist.
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  Social anxiety disorder, whatever.
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  That's what you feel nervous if you're posting on Facebook.
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  You need a drug for that.
[45:18.000 --> 45:19.000]  Let me tell you this.
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  My father's a doctor, and my brother's a doctor.
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  So I'm very familiar with the medical community,
[45:23.000 --> 45:27.000]  and my brother's married to a psychiatrist.
[45:27.000 --> 45:31.000]  They're her number one thing is to prescribe drugs.
[45:31.000 --> 45:32.000]  That's it.
[45:32.000 --> 45:33.000]  And that's what they do.
[45:33.000 --> 45:34.000]  They don't try to cure anything.
[45:34.000 --> 45:35.000]  They just manage it now.
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  Yeah, you're well informed, man.
[45:37.000 --> 45:41.000]  They manage these people with drugs,
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  and they kill them on drugs for life.
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  And that's what the pharmaceutical companies are proposing,
[45:45.000 --> 45:48.000]  and pitching to these kids, the young people in medical school.
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  They say, it's just, you know, get them on the drugs,
[45:50.000 --> 45:51.000]  and everything will be fine.
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.000]  So what we're seeing is we're seeing this backlash of these people
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  who are unmanageable.
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  And every time there is a school shooting,
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  they create trauma in another 100 kids,
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  which they then diagnose with disorders
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  and put them on psychiatric drugs.
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.000]  So you have this continuing multiplication of drugs
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  and violence and drugs and violence,
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  and the drug companies are making money from the whole thing.
[46:12.000 --> 46:15.000]  And people like Feinstein are using the dead bodies of these children
[46:15.000 --> 46:20.000]  as capital to pass their Adolf Hitler inspired gun
[46:20.000 --> 46:21.000]  confiscation laws.
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.000]  It's insane.
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  It's totally insane.
[46:23.000 --> 46:26.000]  And I think the main thing that people, you know,
[46:26.000 --> 46:29.000]  the citizens, the public has to be aware of,
[46:29.000 --> 46:32.000]  that I don't believe that any of these mass shootings
[46:32.000 --> 46:35.000]  have occurred without the presence of these drugs
[46:35.000 --> 46:37.000]  in the system of the perpetrator.
[46:37.000 --> 46:38.000]  Good point.
[46:38.000 --> 46:39.000]  I mean, Columbine is a great example.
[46:39.000 --> 46:41.000]  Those guys were on these drugs.
[46:41.000 --> 46:42.000]  Oh, yeah.
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.000]  And every one of these three people we talked about,
[46:43.000 --> 46:45.000]  Tucson, the theater in Colorado,
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  and this latest guy absolutely are all on psychotic, psychotic drugs.
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  So the real problem, I believe,
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  is the way we're managing these mental health patients.
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  You know, when I was a kid, and I'm, you know, 55 years old,
[46:57.000 --> 46:58.000]  was that long ago?
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  When I was a kid, there were state hospitals,
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  but they put these people into the,
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  get them away from society so they wouldn't injure
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  or interfere with society, the people in society,
[47:08.000 --> 47:10.000]  and they would also protect themselves.
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  No, they want them running loose now
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  because they can use violence to achieve their political agendas.
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  Folks, if you just tune in, we're talking with Lenny McGill,
[47:18.000 --> 47:21.000]  the founder of Glockstore.com,
[47:21.000 --> 47:24.000]  and he just said they've still got some Glock's available.
[47:24.000 --> 47:27.000]  So if you want to get some, go to Glockstore.com.
[47:27.000 --> 47:30.000]  And of course, obviously, you can't order guns online.
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  I mean, you can't, they just won't ship until you guys
[47:32.000 --> 47:33.000]  ship to your FFL dealer.
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  That's another liberal media lie that you can just buy guns online.
[47:36.000 --> 47:39.000]  No, you have to pick it up at your local FFL dealer,
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  but you can still get Glock's at Glockstore.com.
[47:42.000 --> 47:45.000]  Now, I want to give out the 800 number for callers.
[47:45.000 --> 47:49.000]  And Lenny, I hope you're up for taking a few calls and questions.
[47:49.000 --> 47:53.000]  Let me give that number out, 800-259-9231.
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.000]  Again, 800-259-9231.
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  So go ahead and load up the phone queue, guys,
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  when you get, when you can do that, let me know.
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  And, oh, I see the board right here.
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  So Lenny, what is the mood now,
[48:06.000 --> 48:09.000]  the people that you're talking to there in California,
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.000]  what is the consensus of this Feinstein gun control measure
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  and what level of support or resistance is there to it?
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  Well, it's obviously pretty early to tell,
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.000]  but I say this, yesterday, in our retail store,
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  we have retail outlet here in San Diego,
[48:26.000 --> 48:29.000]  that we were, you know, five feet.
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  A friend of mine called me from Pasadena,
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  and he was at Turner's outdoors,
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  and it was another big retailer.
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  And he said, hey, I'm waiting in line.
[48:37.000 --> 48:41.000]  I've been here for two hours waiting to talk to someone.
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  And he's, you know, this is a retail store.
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  And obviously, just imagine that, you know,
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  that you're waiting in line for two hours at a retail store.
[48:47.000 --> 48:48.000]  And the counter is right there,
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  and there's 12 people in front of you,
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  and everybody's got questions that he's in line for two hours,
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  and he's trying to buy an AR-15.
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.000]  And he said, you know, he called me, he said,
[48:57.000 --> 48:58.000]  do you have anything?
[48:58.000 --> 49:00.000]  I said, no, we're all of our AR-15s, just hold on.
[49:00.000 --> 49:01.000]  He said, what should I do?
[49:01.000 --> 49:02.000]  I said, well, if you buy the first one,
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  you see it because there's just not any available.
[49:04.000 --> 49:07.000]  So the mood is panicking.
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.000]  The mood is, as far as what we can do as citizens,
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  this is the challenge because, you know,
[49:14.000 --> 49:18.000]  you really have a small group of people dictating legislation
[49:18.000 --> 49:22.000]  upon us that really are not, you have to answer yourself.
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  Are they looking out for the big picture?
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  Is this a neat, jerk reaction to this, you know,
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  tragedy up in Connecticut?
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  Or is there a sinister side to this
[49:30.000 --> 49:33.000]  that we don't even comprehend because we can't imagine
[49:33.000 --> 49:36.000]  that our elected official would be sinister?
[49:36.000 --> 49:38.000]  I can imagine that pretty easily.
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  You know, because in reality, you know,
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  I mean, this is the first step,
[49:42.000 --> 49:45.000]  this armament of the people is the first step to control.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  And control people.
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  And so, you know, you look at these tax things
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  that are happening right now, the fiscal cliff
[49:51.000 --> 49:54.000]  and all this other stuff, and you have to ask yourself,
[49:54.000 --> 49:55.000]  what's going on here?
[49:55.000 --> 49:56.000]  I mean, what's at play?
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.000]  Because the government feels like that your money is their money
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  and that they decide that they can give you a little bit back.
[50:04.000 --> 50:07.000]  And, you know, that doesn't make sense.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  Of course, it's total hypocrisy.
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  Plus, Senator Feinstein, she's got her own armed guards.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  And all of these people have their own armed guards.
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.000]  Hey, Obama's children go to school in a school with 11 armed guards.
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  That doesn't even count secret service.
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  And Obama's now even on the record saying
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  he wanted to become president so that his daughter
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  could be surrounded by men with guns.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  So, why did they...
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  We understand that, you know, and that's the total, you know,
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  hypocrisy of that.
[50:34.000 --> 50:35.000]  Of course, the president, you know,
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  children should be surrounded by armed guards.
[50:37.000 --> 50:38.000]  Obviously, that's good.
[50:38.000 --> 50:39.000]  All right.
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  Lenny, stay on the line with us, Lenny.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  We've got to go to break, but we're going to come back
[50:43.000 --> 50:44.000]  and take calls.
[50:44.000 --> 50:48.000]  We've got Larry, Sean, Barron.

[53:01.000 --> 53:04.000]  Hey there, Frank Bates here.
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  Have you heard about the weird device
[53:06.000 --> 53:09.000]  that could wipe out 280 million Americans?
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  This is really scary stuff.
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  Defense experts warn that this odd device
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.000]  poses the greatest threat we've ever known.
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  In fact, just a few weeks ago,
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  former Speaker of the House,
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  Donald Trump,
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  and an op-ed piece for the Washington Post
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  warning about this deadly threat.
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  It may be because the liberals in the government
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  are trying to cover it up.
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  That's why my friend just created a free video
[53:35.000 --> 53:38.000]  at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat
[53:38.000 --> 53:41.000]  and blows the doors off the conspiracy.
[53:41.000 --> 53:44.000]  Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  right now to discover exactly what it is
[53:47.000 --> 53:50.000]  that you and your family can survive this deadly attack.
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  I'm not sure how long this video will be online,
[53:52.000 --> 53:55.000]  so go to weirddevice.com before it's gone forever.

[55:13.440 --> 55:21.360]  on hopefully on gun control well it is and uh I want to know what you guys think this is another
[55:21.360 --> 55:28.080]  fast and furious deal this uh over on the east coast they give out the name of uh weapon holders
[55:28.080 --> 55:35.440]  and name and address so people can go break into their house steal more guns and uh you know that's
[55:35.440 --> 55:41.120]  another reason to take our guns away yeah yeah that that's true they they're treating gun owners
[55:41.120 --> 55:46.000]  almost like uh child predators or something and posting them on the internet what's your what are
[55:46.000 --> 55:52.240]  your thoughts Lenny well yeah that's that's a disturbing fact uh and and trend uh is to paint
[55:52.240 --> 55:59.360]  a gun owner as a nut there is a crazy person or as a uh uh you know a psycholumatic type you know
[55:59.360 --> 56:04.880]  and which is quite the opposite you know I mean we we see now the the the type of people who are
[56:04.880 --> 56:12.640]  buying firearms are women uh in their fifties uh judges lawyers doctors you know uh professional
[56:12.640 --> 56:18.880]  people uh construction workers I mean it's across the board it's the it's not the stereotype of
[56:18.880 --> 56:23.440]  the guy in camouflage fatigues buying a firearm you know that's that's over you know people buying
[56:23.440 --> 56:31.120]  firearms are mainstream normal family people who want to be able to protect themselves against
[56:31.120 --> 56:35.760]  the hordes of people who will be storming their doors when the government checks stop going to
[56:35.760 --> 56:40.320]  them oh yeah it's moms and grandmas and aunts and uncles too a lot of women are buying guns today
[56:40.320 --> 56:44.240]  is are you seeing that too that's exactly what we're seeing and and and we're getting calls from
[56:44.240 --> 56:48.880]  people you know who never had a firearm before and say you know what I want to get one now and now
[56:48.880 --> 56:53.600]  it's time I want to do it right now and you know this the secret is in the liberal community the
[56:53.600 --> 56:59.120]  secret is most liberals want guns for themselves they just don't want guns for everybody else
[56:59.120 --> 57:03.680]  that they have them for themselves they do have them yeah she already has she hasn't
[57:03.680 --> 57:08.560]  registered to her family it's a fact you know she has guns it's just that oh well you know
[57:08.560 --> 57:16.320]  I'm more responsible than you are yeah well hey she's got you know she's got I guess the genetic
[57:16.320 --> 57:23.200]  code granted uh by the the globalist or something maybe she's got royal blood or or you know reptilian
[57:23.200 --> 57:27.440]  blood circulating through her veins there you go that's a scary thought but here's something I think
[57:27.440 --> 57:31.120]  we need to we need to put on the table right now because the only way to get out of this mess
[57:31.680 --> 57:39.840]  is to call for term limits for all offices we need to limit the amount of time these people spend
[57:39.840 --> 57:45.840]  in these powerful positions because power corrupt yes and we're all human and so that's what needs to
[57:45.840 --> 57:50.960]  be done we cannot let these people be lifetime politicians and become perverted in their thoughts
[57:50.960 --> 57:55.120]  in their ways and that's exactly what we're seeing in 5-9 and exactly we're seeing these
[57:55.120 --> 58:00.480]  in a dick derbent and all these other career politicians they come up with these crazy thoughts
[58:00.480 --> 58:04.960]  because they're not citizens anymore no no they they live the lifestyle of control freaks and
[58:04.960 --> 58:08.960]  gun grabbers and they think that only they have the right to be protected okay but thank you for
[58:08.960 --> 58:13.520]  your call Larry very good question let's go to oh baron stay on the line all right we'll come to

[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:08.640]  their children so let's go to another caller brawn from alabama you are on the line go ahead sir
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.800]  that you're taking my call uh i called the last time that you were in hosting yes i remember and
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:23.440]  i got did i get your name right this time yeah i appreciate that um awesome i run wtfrly.com um
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:26.880]  i don't know if you've been there yet but the reason i called was because you said something
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:31.280]  that stuck out to me and i just said this the other day you know that basically guns are going
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:38.960]  to become the new drugs um you know in that black market mantra and what i um what i had
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:43.600]  discussed with someone else was that there's a video game and things called 2033 uh something
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:50.800]  like that but basically there the new currency became ammo because the you know at that point
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:56.080]  there was really no more ammo in the scenario that took place and there were a lot of homemade
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:02.560]  bullets running around but the currency became ammo yeah well ammo is infinitely barterable
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.240]  and and those are good points but um since lenny's are our guests right now do you have a question
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:13.920]  for lenny uh specifically i i want to know how do we kind of counteract this this meme
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:21.120]  because there's a lot of uh there's a lot of racism charges being thrown around and i've
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:26.400]  personally been in you know a gun store here you know one of the biggest gun deals in the nation and
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:33.600]  it never fails every time you go in there there's people of all races in there you know all ages
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:41.840]  both sexes yeah and that narrative has to be counteracted somehow you know i wanted to suggest
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:46.640]  maybe making uh some kind of video to kind of illustrate the ridiculousness of it all right
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:51.840]  let me throw that to lenny how do we show gun owners as the responsible law abiding community
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:58.960]  minded citizens that they truly are well that's a great question um you know no one really wants
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:05.040]  to be uh uh profiled i guess as a gun owner today i mean most people i know are pretty stealthy about
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:09.680]  it they you know they haven't done it they uh basically you will uh you know take it home
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:14.240]  and put it safe and and just have it you know and they don't advertise it uh many people are
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:19.200]  are not running down the street with a uh uh you know a rifle rack in the back of the shotgun
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.880]  or back of the pickup truck anymore uh don't go visit or we present people as normal people
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.280]  that's a great question because you know like i said and like i think your call is saying is
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:34.320]  we are seeing that the people who are personally firearms the people who are buying firearms now
[01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:40.480]  are your mainstream americans and they're white black brown red they're all the colors i mean it's
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:45.760]  though there's no difference there it's just a matter of hey i i want to have an opportunity
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:52.080]  and i want to have the ability to protect myself against either the government or a bad guy uh and
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:55.760]  i i need a firearm to do that because you know hey bottom line is that's where firearms were
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:04:01.040]  invented you know to protect yourself against the bad guy crashing your door down maybe six
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.600]  with four three hundred pounds good good answer lenny and good question baron thank you for your
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:12.560]  your call today and lenny is there is there some coalition of gun rights groups that might
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:19.360]  be putting together uh you know a video response or or psas to tell the real story about how gun
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:26.400]  owners are responsible citizens members of society like you said judges lawyers moms and dads uh you

[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:02.320]  yeah ghandi was not the pacifist that you've been told he actually supported armed defense against
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:07.520]  tyranny and oppression and so did martin luther king by the way who owned his own arsenal of weapons
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:12.960]  and actually applied for a concealed carry permit martin luther king knew that people were trying to
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:19.040]  kill him and he was right and that's why he needed a gun as do we all because it's an uncertain world
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:23.520]  we law-abiding citizens want to have the right to keep our children our families and our communities

[01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:12.320]  thank you for continuing with us lennie this will be the uh we'll just have you through this segment
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:18.240]  which is a long segment but let's go back to callers shon in california you are on the air
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:22.800]  thank you for joining us and do you have a question for lennie hey mike thanks for picking my call
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:28.640]  um this is shon actually worked on the dumb and lazy video with you oh awesome man thank you great
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:33.040]  yeah i was going yeah i'm a big out strong span and you know you as well so anyway um
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:38.960]  i think a lot of the anti-gun advocate especially on my friends on facebook um i think it's a lot
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:43.920]  of misinformation first they don't even know what an assault weapon is true you know they're
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:50.160]  they're just really great great blog that uh i think it's contradictions with a k and he
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:56.160]  goes down with a list of these evil items like a shroud you know and all that does is you know
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:02.720]  protect from the heat um so when you present this type of information to them it really exposes them
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.640]  as people that are against your second amendment rights because that's what they want in the end
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:11.600]  because they begin the conversation with we need to start talking about guns but they don't actually
[01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:15.760]  you know in the end they want to take away your gun well and and they're just freaked out by scary
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:22.400]  looking guns which to them is any gun that has a black polymer stock or you know vertical rails
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:26.800]  anywhere it's just a scary looking gun they you're right they don't know much about guns but do you
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:33.360]  have a question shon for lenny yeah lenny um actually uh my question was finance proposing
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:40.160]  a ban on any handgun that can accept more than 10 rounds and that's basically all glocks so
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:46.720]  how are you know what are you doing to um to fight that and do you think that this will pass
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:52.960]  well that's a great question obviously being very impactful in our business because we specialize
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:58.560]  in glock and guys of course the glock has you know always gotten this this this popularity uh
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:02.160]  and then of course it's negative press because it's been used in some of these shooting so
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.840]  right now obviously you know glock is working heavily uh you know on this uh because you know
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:16.080]  they know that uh their gun is used by 70 percent of law enforcement nationwide it's not going to
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:22.400]  go away i mean it's used by the fbi to keep it serviced at the cia the dda and of course all the
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.840]  lot of the local law enforcement agencies uh nationwide the uh sheriffs and police departments
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:33.600]  around the country so you know what what can we do as gun owners again i think you know we have to
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.320]  show up and we have to make sure that you know that our representatives understand that hey we
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:43.280]  don't want any of this legislation we don't want uh anybody to be uh telling us uh how to live our
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:51.200]  lives and how to uh to manage you know the way we want to protect ourselves you know we have to
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.360]  tell these people who work for us these are politicians who are elected and work for us to
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:13:00.800]  take our money they get paid with our money let's tell them you know no we have to tell them no don't
[01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:06.400]  do that uh and i think that we at some point are all going to have to start to uh get on the phone
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.920]  and start to write letters and become very vocal because there's really a smaller group of people
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:18.160]  you know the liberal minded people who uh are are dictating the uh conversation and i believe that
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:23.120]  most people they want to have another angle on this though from the caller is it's a good question
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:30.000]  but it's going to put you out of business and if feinstein's gun confiscation system passes it's
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:35.600]  going to destroy jobs in california like your employees and and of course many other gun
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:40.400]  manufacturers across america this is this has got to be a red alert situation for you personally
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:44.720]  as well as all your employees absolutely you know we're definitely you know it's all it's all
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:50.000]  a radar you know i mean she's uh you know she's not really looking at the big picture uh you know
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.160]  there's a knee jerk reaction to say that look i did something you know that's gonna help those
[01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:59.600]  children in in connecticut and in reality that's not true well it's totally not true the best way
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.400]  to help those children in schools first take down those silly signs that say gun free zone which
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:11.200]  are advertising them as basically child shooting preserves or something it's ridiculous do these
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:18.480]  do these gun grabbers actually think those signs are magical it's a magical power yeah i mean like
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.040]  oh okay i won't take a gun in there and be bad you know i won't be a bad guy there uh you know and
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:30.080]  again as you know we we really you know i have to get back to the motivation and the um uh the mindset
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:34.720]  of these shooters and and say well what made someone do that why would they do that and no normal
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:39.360]  person would do that right we all agree that that's not a normal thing yeah and again we have to
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:46.240]  realize that every one of them have been prescribed pharmaceutical psychopsychotic drug that changed
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:51.760]  their personalities and increased the aggression and homicidal suicidal thoughts you got it good
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:56.320]  good question sean thank you for your call let's go to another caller now again we don't screen your
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:15:03.200]  calls and the name is coming coming up here as mouse link in new york now uh is that a nick
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:08.480]  name sir or or what's your what's your question and where where's your name come from that's my
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:15.200]  twitter handle got it yeah fight me info warren twitter hey so i'm not really a big gun guy and
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:20.880]  i follow i follow technological issues primarily and one of the things that i've been seeing a lot
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:26.720]  about out there these days is this personal manufacturing movement called 3d printing are
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:31.440]  you not familiar with this yeah you bet that's not fabrication yeah yeah and so what i'm starting
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:37.680]  to see is i'm starting to see of the miscellaneous blog or video out there about people who are
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:43.360]  basically manufacturing their own gun parts and so what i did this morning is i sent a tweet to
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:49.600]  senator Kleinstein and i basically asked her about her assault weapons ban and how she planned on
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:57.280]  on dealing with 3d printing and i was wondering from somebody who's in the gun business just kind of
[01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:01.440]  what your thoughts are on that and how that could change things and how you know potentially that
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:06.480]  could circumvent any kind of legislation like this couldn't it uh yeah good good question caller but
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:11.280]  before you answer that lennie let me just also state so far that technology obviously can only
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:18.000]  render 3d polymer objects not the metal parts that are needed in guns but that could of course
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.640]  be something that advances in the future but go ahead lennie it's a legit question yeah i've
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:26.000]  actually seen those 3d printers in action and just where your caller you don't know what it is
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:32.240]  it's basically it's a laser device that uh goes in and and an awful computer program and it will cut
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:38.640]  uh like you said plastic into shapes and and models and it's come a long way really in the
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:46.480]  past five years and it is does have the capacity to uh to develop a uh uh polymer frame yes then
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:50.720]  you can put the metal parts on top of which is what the clock really is however you know there
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:55.120]  are some limitations there i mean nothing can't be done but you know there are still uh a couple
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:01.120]  metal pieces but the the controlled serial number part of the clock is the metal slide i believe not
[01:17:01.120 --> 01:17:06.400]  the not the polymer it's the polymer slide it is it really is that's what hold on the polymer frame
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:12.320]  is look at mine over here um the frame is the is the gun and everything else is apart wow that's
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.240]  interesting so okay so with an ar obviously the receiver is normally the serial numbered part
[01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:20.880]  that's metal you can't make that with desktop manufacturing but but with a glock that is actually
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:25.680]  an aluminum part uh the receivers are aluminum yes they are you know either coming up build or
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.040]  coming into uh you know a forging and then they're just drilled out uh and basically so it's a
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:35.440]  fairly simple process but the machine you know shop that can make these things so it's not really
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:39.360]  impossible to make in these guns but i think the big answer is going to be that they'll just pass
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:44.800]  more laws to say it's illegal to manufacture a gun uh using additive manufacturing which is what
[01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:49.840]  these desktop um um 3d printers really really are well yeah and the problem is again they're going to
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.200]  pass more laws and more laws and more laws and everybody's going to be a criminal at any time
[01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:56.160]  that's right the government say you know what they're going to do they're going to say we don't
[01:17:56.160 --> 01:18:00.160]  agree with your politics and by the way you broke how long you're going to jail yep that's right that's
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:04.640]  exactly what this whole thing's about is today is that everybody's a criminal and if we don't like
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:09.200]  you we don't you don't agree with us you don't go along with us or you're too vocal or you're too
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:14.720]  this we're going to put your jail oh no they're probably everybody in jail they'll outlaw the vector 3d
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:20.160]  printing file so even if you if your computer possesses the file that could be used to print
[01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:25.120]  out a let's say a glock frame then all of a sudden you're a felon all right everybody's a felon
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:31.280]  everybody can go to jail based upon the whim of the supreme leader good question mouse link really
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.960]  really good question very relevant to what's happening here today let's go to another caller
[01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:41.040]  joseph in arizona joseph you are on the air on national radio with lennie mcgill go ahead please
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:48.960]  yeah how you doing like and uh lennie how you doing doing good yeah hi um actually uh i want to
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:54.160]  thank uh lennie for putting out a lot of videos in the 90s i actually learned a lot he was the gun
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:59.600]  video guy before mackerel guys and uh you know james jager and all of them but uh the main reason
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:04.880]  what i'm calling is uh i've seen him in uh at chateau videos on youtube so i know he and as an
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:10.320]  industry person i know he regularly attends um right only a few seconds go ahead with a question
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:17.760]  please yes uh the question is um i want to call this the ronnie barrett option uh during late 90s
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:26.720]  and mid 2000s uh ronnie barrett uh when he saw le pd were using his uh m82 50 bmgl rifles as a prop
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:31.760]  as an ad to prop for a propaganda against a 50 cal when they were banning it he probably wrote a
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:37.600]  letter to uh commissioner bryden i think that was at the time saying he will not sell resupply
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:43.280]  or service anymore californian government agencies or any agencies and went to ban it
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:49.040]  i'm wondering at we're just about out of time five seconds yeah i'm just wondering if there'll be any
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:55.760]  move at the shot show to get a lot of industry personnel to sign on to forbid sale service all
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:58.480]  right let me know you'll have to answer that question on the other side can you stay with us
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:04.160]  one more segment please i'll be right we'll be right back we have witnessed two terrible storms

[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:24.640]  alex today thank you for joining us we're continuing our conversation on gun control
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:30.560]  with lennie mcgill the founder of glock store dot com and we just took a question from a caller
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:35.360]  and lennie i'd like to turn that question over to you i to summarize it i think it was a question
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:42.720]  of would gun shops refuse to service government but that doesn't make sense because so many law
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:49.520]  enforcement you know police officers are actually very much pro constitution people pro bill of
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:53.440]  rights people so what are your thoughts on that lennie well he mentioned the shot show and that's
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:56.880]  the big industry trade show that's going to be happening in two weeks in los vegas and obviously
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:01.280]  there's going to be some you know some kind of action going on there uh the the real question is
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:07.760]  you know will gun manufacturers uh who support them like i said uh support them uh the law
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:12.640]  enforcement agencies you know nationwide with their products uh will they say hey you know
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:17.840]  you guys have to also come to the table with us and and start to fight these you know crazy
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:22.480]  loss because they are crazy i mean this is this is a control factor this is what your audience
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:25.920]  has to realize you know obviously the time is short here and i want to try to close out with
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:31.920]  what people know that you know this can gun control is people control has nothing to do with firearms
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:37.280]  it's about controlling your ability to protect yourself against the government and against bad
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:42.960]  guys who can crash into your house you know it's it's about controlling you and the way you operate
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:47.600]  and the way you live you know and it's just like taxes taxes are all about control they don't want
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:51.440]  you to have too much time or too much money because you have too much money you have too much time
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:56.080]  so they'll take away your money and they'll take away your gun and then they'll tell you exactly
[01:25:56.080 --> 01:26:00.640]  what you have to do and back now look at what's happening with health care you have to buy my
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:06.240]  health care or i'm gonna tax you more so you know this is a crazy world we're living in and we have
[01:26:06.240 --> 01:26:14.240]  to be very careful not to lose this ability to keep and maintain firearms in our homes well said
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:19.200]  Lenny McGill of Glockstore.com i appreciate your time thank you for joining us today and hopefully

[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:23.840]  want to thank you you know also Alex and the rest of the stuff for uh waking me up um basically
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:28.160]  i've been listening for the last two years first time i'm calling so i'm kind of nervous here
[01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:32.320]  that's all right i appreciate your your thanks what what are your thoughts on all
[01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:38.640]  everything that's happening well you know it really gets me upset that um how this government is
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:47.840]  just abolishing our um constitution and and you guys woke me up you know woke me up and
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:53.920]  right now i truly believe we should go and follow the constitution so i also also enjoy listening
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:28:02.160]  to you know the keeper and that's really awesome the question really Mike is um is there perhaps a
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:08.320]  rally coming up at the Capitol before you know government tries to take our you know
[01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:12.800]  good good question there's a there's a lot of people asking this question what can we do right now
[01:28:12.800 --> 01:28:18.960]  in truth it's still very early in this process remember Feinstein's gun grabbing Adolf Hitler
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:28.160]  inspired uh uh proposal just came out yesterday and and so this is very new give this some time
[01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:34.160]  and i am sure there will be marches there will be protest organized there will be online events
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:40.240]  organized info wars right now today is already organizing a petition to try diane feinstein
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:46.160]  for treason i think i think that was authored by info wars anyway it's up it's up at info wars.com
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:53.040]  so there are things starting i saw a youtube video just yesterday of an activist who
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:59.280]  turned around that celebrity video and and said uh you know we must end the government
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:04.960]  violence using firearms so there's there's already efforts underway and i know there will be more
[01:29:04.960 --> 01:29:11.680]  i know that that at natural news we're going to be fighting for liberty and and and working to
[01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:17.840]  the raise awareness and rally activists so don't worry that's uh that's coming and by the way we're
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:22.320]  going to we're going to take some more calls uh not not yet but when we come back i want to take
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:27.840]  the call from clark in arizona a former cop so clark if you're on the line please stay on the

[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:26.160]  in arizona named clark who has been holding on the subject of firearms in the new
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:34.480]  a gun confiscation proposal put out by diane feinstein who now has a petition circulating to
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:41.360]  try her for treason for for attempting to overthrow the second amendment the bill of rights
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.960]  uh anyway let's go to clark uh go ahead clark sir you are on the air thank you for calling and
[01:33:46.960 --> 01:33:51.520]  what can we do for you today we're off with a happy new year for all of us although i'm a
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:57.520]  little optimistic on that one yeah uh i was a former i'm a former law enforcement officer
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:04.560]  i'm also a combat marine and uh over the years when i come from a law enforcement family my dad
[01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:09.840]  was a cop for over 30 years my grandfather was a beat cop at new york city etc etc
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:17.840]  we all know that taking away the guns will not stop crime yeah we also know that by taking
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:21.600]  away the guns criminal will have a field day because they don't care how they get theirs
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:27.600]  that's right and you know what i'm looking at is the big picture all this how do these idiots
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:33.120]  these new world order morons better they're going to collect all two-thirds of the country owned guns
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:39.760]  when you do two or two-thirds of the country in jail well they would love that budget they would
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:45.120]  love that well the prison is a big growing industry so so they would they wouldn't play hell
[01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:50.560]  yeah you take a look here at my maricopa county i don't live here i'm just down here you know for
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:57.680]  the winter i live in northern arizona uh here in maricopa county share of your uh dillard our
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:02.880]  our title i believe that's how you pronounce his name just announced the other day he's taking a
[01:35:02.880 --> 01:35:08.000]  sheriff's posse which are reserve deputies they're all sworn deputies and they're gonna put them
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:16.640]  in all the schools of maricopa county yeah and it's spreading like wildfire so let me ask you
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:23.280]  clark um if if the order comes down for local police to go confiscate door to door uh do you
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:28.400]  think they will follow that or will they quit or will they refuse what what will happen they will
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.880]  quit go home and they will take care of their families and protect their own yeah that's what
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:36.960]  i'm hearing from everybody else i don't come to many of them i know many of them here in this state
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:44.640]  i know a few in another state where i've lived previously and worked uh that's number one they
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:50.960]  don't want to get shot trying to collect a firearm yeah an unlawful order from the federal government
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:58.400]  yep uh most of them are pro gun that was my next question what percentage of cops today do you
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:03.200]  think are actually pro second amendment because i think it's very high pretty high right around
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:09.760]  80 percent yep i think you nailed it clark good points and good questions i appreciate your call
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:15.120]  and stay strong man we need people like you in america to help protect our second amendment
[01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:21.520]  rights let's go to brad in toronto for a possibly canadian point of view on the whole issue
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:26.720]  brad you're on the air go ahead with your question sir i might uh first time caller
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:33.600]  uh just wanted to get your take on it uh like the comment that i have been a listener uh for
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:39.520]  a long time many years i'm just really skeptical when i hear that you know it'll be a civil war if
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:45.760]  they try to collect the guns because like recent history sort of tells us the exact opposite it's
[01:36:45.760 --> 01:36:51.440]  like the government does not obey their own laws they go ahead and they do and they have
[01:36:51.440 --> 01:36:56.800]  done whatever that they've wanted i just don't see when uh right they're not going to come and
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:37:03.040]  grab all the guns i don't think they're gonna end up coming back with uh laws that we have here uh
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:10.240]  you know the bogus uh 10 round magazines and banning certain guns for you know because they
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:14.240]  look scary without any good reason so they're not going to do everything all at once will be
[01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:18.640]  incremental that's a good point and and i think people are just gonna say okay well that's not
[01:37:18.640 --> 01:37:26.640]  going to affect me so uh people are going to be tamed but uh i i hope i'm wrong because if they if
[01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:31.520]  you guys go further than what we've gone here in canada like how long is it going to be before i have
[01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:36.960]  to turn in my ar here so well you're you're right about the incremental approach that is exactly
[01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:41.440]  you nailed it that's how it's going to happen they're going to say first oh all you need to do is
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:47.680]  register your guns well let's actually back up first it was we're not coming for your guns your
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:53.600]  conspiracy theorists if you think we are right that's the way it was until a few days ago now
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:59.120]  it's oh we are coming for your guns but you really only have to just register your guns
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:05.120]  we won't ever take them right and that'll go for a little while and people will go along with it
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:09.200]  probably well some will and they'll say oh well it's just paperwork and what does it matter that
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:12.480]  we're letting the government build a database of where we live and then the serial numbers of our
[01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:19.600]  firearms and then do you think feinstein will stop at gun registration no it'll be confiscation
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:24.560]  they will stage another shooting and then they will say oh well we already have a list of everybody
[01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:29.680]  who owns the firearms let's just go take them so you're right sir it will be an incremental
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:36.480]  confiscation in-game result and those who refuse to give them up after you've registered if you
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:40.800]  refuse to give it up they'll just throw you in jail or shoot you i'll just execute people right
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:45.840]  there on the spot but a good call thank you for your call and i want to mention to the guys running
[01:38:45.840 --> 01:38:51.040]  the board there we do want to get kelly on the phone as soon as possible and go ahead and get
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:57.440]  into the psychiatric drug interviews but until then let's continue all right great let's continue
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:03.680]  to take some calls duff in kansas is on the air go ahead duff what's your question or comment
[01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:13.200]  well um i want to make two points um i'm a recovering addict and i got clean in
[01:39:14.240 --> 01:39:24.480]  96 and upon leaving treatment one of the things that they insisted that i did was to get on zoloft
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:32.320]  and uh you know i couldn't get my head wrapped around the fact that i went to a treatment facility
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:41.840]  to get clean just to trade drugs and you know they told me i'd never hold down a job
[01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:50.160]  i would struggle for the rest of my life and that's not true you know i've had the same job for 14
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:56.000]  years so you got off an addictive substance and you got on a zoloft and did have you had experiences
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:04.080]  with with zoloft no no i wouldn't get on anything oh you refused i refused it i refused it it didn't
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:10.960]  make any sense to me you know to go to a drug treatment center to get off of one thing and on
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:15.600]  to another yeah well that's good for you i mean that's the scam today they they do want you to
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:20.640]  just go to their drugs see they want you to buy big pharma's drugs rather than street drugs that's
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:27.040]  the whole deal the the whole see that's where funding's coming from yeah but they get they get
[01:40:27.040 --> 01:40:33.360]  funded you know because our governor at the time was Kathleen Sibelius you know and and her her
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:38.160]  philosophy behind the jail was we need to take the money away from the state funded treatment
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:45.680]  facilities and build the jails bigger because you can never build the jails big enough can you in a
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:50.400]  in a police state you just have to keep expanding those jails you know max kaiser was right you
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:57.520]  should all buy stock in prisons and then when you go to prison you'll be making money on yourself
[01:40:57.520 --> 01:41:02.720]  imagine that what a great money making opportunity in the land of the formerly free well thank you
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:06.960]  for your call sir that's that's a good point and that does segue actually into our next segment
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:12.560]  where we have a guest an expert on psychiatric drugs her name is kelly o'Mara she is the author
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:18.240]  of the book called psyched out she's an investigative journalist and she was actually one of the first
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:24.640]  to expose the link between school shootings and psychiatric drugs in her 1999 cover story guns
[01:41:24.640 --> 01:41:32.240]  and doses and she writes for washington times and insight magazine and the other publications she
[01:41:32.240 --> 01:41:38.080]  joins us now by phone thank you kelly and welcome to the show it's a pleasure to be with you mike
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:43.680]  it's great to have you on i hope you are buckled in and ready for an interesting hour of comments
[01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:49.680]  and calls yeah it should be interesting well let's start from the top tell us what do you know
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:56.000]  through your investigations and research what is your knowledge of the real link between psychiatric
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:04.400]  drugs and school shooters well as you as you just said i i was actually the first national reporter
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:12.960]  to put out a cover story on this guns and doses and is right after columbine um and basically what
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:19.680]  i showed was i think it was the last uh 10 out of 13 shooters at that time had been on psychiatric
[01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:27.840]  drugs or were coming off of them um and that eric harris uh was on a mind-altering drug a
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:34.640]  psychiatric mind-altering drug um at the time of the shooting so uh since then you know i can't
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:40.960]  believe it's been what 15 years um we're still dealing with this as far as i'm concerned um and
[01:42:40.960 --> 01:42:47.840]  the problem is that nobody wants to address this connection yeah isn't that interesting i the mainstream
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:53.200]  media of course is largely funded by the drug companies and their psychiatric drugs so it
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:43:00.320]  seems to be unwilling to really cover this story have you seen resistance in the media to your
[01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:04.400]  covering of it for example have you have you ever pitched stories to mainstream magazines and they
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:08.480]  said no way we won't cover this because of our advertisers they never tell you it's because
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:17.280]  of advertisers no what do they say well they just turn it down it's randomly deleted uh yeah that's
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:23.840]  the life of a journalist though yeah but you know i mean i i look at it and i've done enough research
[01:43:23.840 --> 01:43:31.520]  i wrote a book about it um the the connection is definitely there um i i don't understand especially
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:41.280]  with the recent event uh in newtown um why the public still is not told um whether these people
[01:43:41.280 --> 01:43:46.880]  are on psychiatric drugs i think in today's world with the millions of people in the united states
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:53.280]  alone who take psychiatric drugs um i think it's it's odd to say the least that that's not one of
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:58.560]  the first things that that's the law enforcement or investigators try to find out well no what
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:02.880]  happens after these shootings is immediately the mainstream media and the white house begin to try
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:09.440]  to shape the story and they try to shape it to for example to say oh it was an ar-15 bushmaster
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:14.560]  even though that was actually left in the guy's car it wasn't even brought into the school we just
[01:44:14.560 --> 01:44:19.520]  learned uh that you know that's a fact that they won't talk about and then when neighbors say oh
[01:44:19.520 --> 01:44:25.440]  yeah the kid was on psychiatric drugs and he was seeing a psychiatrist uh that then starts to get
[01:44:25.440 --> 01:44:29.760]  muscled in the press they don't want that to come out so we see the shaping of the story
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:37.840]  to take away the blame from psychiatric drugs and place the blame on a firearm a specific brand of gun
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:43.520]  well i do believe that they that they shaped the story obviously i mean we we all watched it over
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:48.240]  the the weekend after newtown and and when we saw the talk shows and how it was being shaped
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:56.000]  the the thing is um that this kid this i hate to even call him a kid he was a young man
[01:44:56.000 --> 01:45:02.400]  yeah 20 years old this was not a child okay at least not physically maybe maybe mentally um
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:12.560]  and we know that he had some psychiatric issues we know that i mean everyone has pretty much said
[01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:18.960]  it to what extent that's the question when was he diagnosed what was he diagnosed with how many
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:24.560]  drugs has even given over his short life and who is his psychiatrist and who is his psychiatrist
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:30.640]  or was it even a psychiatrist was it just a regular md because you know in today's world
[01:45:30.640 --> 01:45:36.640]  most of the drugging most of the diagnosing is going on by by your family doctor not a psychiatrist
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:43.440]  mm-hmm which is even more bizarre when you start to think about it um because if there is a
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:47.360]  specialty of psychiatry which i'm sure we've given to a very long conversation about that
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:54.400]  um you know these are regular doctors who may spend five or ten minutes talking to you and your
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:46:02.000]  child um and you know they deduce that oh it could be add it could be adhd oh they're depressed i
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.840]  mean you know you go through the checklist in from the dsm and you know hand them a drug uh that's
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:12.880]  really where we're at in today's world let me read some of the statistics from the graphic that
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:17.360]  that you have provided us today go ahead and put that back on screen if you could guys just just to
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:23.520]  show these are some of the side effects that are documented in clinical studies and published in
[01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:29.360]  peer-reviewed medical journals uh the side effects of these antidepressants and psychotropic drugs
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:35.120]  they include violence aggression homicidal ideation which means imagining killing people
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:41.920]  uh psychosis hostility and mania and i know that's a shortened version of the list kelly
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:48.240]  right oh it's totally a shortened list but but but those are the most important things to look at
[01:46:48.240 --> 01:46:53.520]  i mean when you when you look at the fda and they approve the psychiatric drugs the ssri the
[01:46:53.520 --> 01:47:02.720]  antidepressants um you know suicidality homicidality mania uh psychosis you know these are the things
[01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:08.160]  that you know people must be saying themselves oh it won't happen to me i'm not one of the four percent
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:14.560]  um as a clinical trials four percent of the clinical trials uh people experience those adverse
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:20.560]  reaction well unfortunately those people are walking around us say they are among us that's
[01:47:20.560 --> 01:47:27.280]  that's almost one in 20 people it's one in 125 yeah uh that's that's a large i mean yeah in a in a
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:31.280]  population of what tens of millions of people being put on these drugs you're going to have
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:39.200]  you know many thousands of homicidal drugged up maniacs yeah i mean the thing is what's so
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:43.600]  sad is that you know these are regular people who went to their doctor who you know i think
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:48.880]  legitimately were you know possibly depressed and whatever they've been put on these drugs and
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:54.320]  and i don't know do they all go home and read about the the the possible adverse side effects
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:47:59.680]  because these are very very serious drugs they're not drugs to be played with okay but their doctors
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:04.080]  tell them they're perfectly safe you need this this will help you like a caller that we just
[01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:10.000]  had said that when he went into the addiction treatment center they practically demanded
[01:48:10.000 --> 01:48:17.920]  that he go on zoloft oh how interesting yeah yeah because you know gee someone who's already has a
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:24.400]  chemical addiction problem i guess they need other chemicals prescribed by big pharma that
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:28.720]  seems to be the uh what's going on out there but let me let me read you this this is this is bizarre
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:32.640]  i want your comments on this cali and then i do want to take some calls for you as well
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:40.480]  here's some news out of abc news in a western australia mental hospital the wrong man was
[01:48:40.480 --> 01:48:48.000]  grabbed by police on the street an innocent man because he was mistaken for an escaped psychiatric
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:55.520]  patient they then grabbed the man stuffed him back into the psychiatric hospital and drugged him up
[01:48:55.520 --> 01:49:01.920]  with a powerful antipsychotic schizophrenia drug and the only reason they realized their mistake
[01:49:01.920 --> 01:49:05.760]  was because the drug caused a massive allergic reaction and they had to rush him to the emergency
[01:49:05.760 --> 01:49:10.880]  room they realized this is the wrong guy so now they can just grab you off the street
[01:49:11.680 --> 01:49:17.840]  forcibly drug you and and damage your brain with these chemicals even though you're completely
[01:49:17.840 --> 01:49:24.720]  innocent this was in australia yeah this was in australia wow yeah it's right it's on abc news
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:32.080]  it's called wrong man drugged after psychiatric hospital mistake from december 26th wow yeah so
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:37.520]  i mean i guess we just match a description now pardon me i was just saying if we match a description
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:41.360]  of of a psych ward patient now we can be arrested and drug
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:53.040]  your comments well i mean i don't i'm not sure well you know well i'm the uh the marine who
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:50:01.200]  wrote something on facebook rob yeah brand brand rob yeah he had something sort of similar happened
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:09.680]  to him here um i don't know that we're to that point in this country yet um and maybe it's because
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:14.560]  so many people voluntarily go to the doctor to get these drugs i don't know you know what i mean
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:23.120]  what bothers me is that people don't understand the process and when i wrote my book that was
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:30.000]  really the whole point of writing my book was informed consent um i don't think people understand
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:36.640]  that these diagnoses these psychiatric diagnoses are not based in science they literally are
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:43.760]  voted into the they make it up they just invent it with a show of hands they make it up right all

[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:36.160]  right now and you definitely will not want to miss that news and for this segment and into
[01:54:36.160 --> 01:54:40.960]  the next hour we are continuing our interview with kelly omara the author of psyched out
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:47.680]  how psychiatry sells mental illness and pushes pills that kill that book is available on amazon
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:54.400]  dot com and many other resellers as well and and before we go back to kelly and take some calls
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:55:00.560]  this news was just handed to me by erin dykes paul craig roberts has published another excellent
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:06.240]  story paul craig roberts is one of my favorite writers by the way but this story brings up the
[01:55:06.240 --> 01:55:11.840]  very good point that you know how we play that video in the last hour that the rifle of adam
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:17.840]  lanza was left in the vehicle and found in the vehicle and that only four handguns were found
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:24.800]  actually in the school as paul craig roberts points out the school has a security camera and
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:31.280]  locked doors they would not have let adam lanza into the school if he had been carrying a rifle
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:36.880]  the only way they let him in is because he must have been hiding handguns and then that's that's
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:44.880]  how i got in and gained access now this even so even though this rifle apparently now was not used
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:49.760]  in the shooting that didn't stop the gun grabbers from screaming about so-called assault weapons
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:56.240]  even though a regular semi-auto ar-15 is in no way an assault weapon you have to have a full
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:02.480]  auto to to be an assault weapon and the prices on those are like 40 000 and you have to go through
[01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:06.720]  an extensive atf background check and it can take six months to even get that if you could even
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:14.720]  find one so the people who are trying to grab assault rifles they are confused they are deranged
[01:56:14.720 --> 01:56:19.840]  they are uninformed they really do not know anything about the weapons that they are trying to ban
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:25.280]  but uh of course there's a psychiatric drug link in with all of these school shootings it seems
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:29.840]  where most of them maybe not a hundred percent but very very high percentage and kelly o'Mara is the
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:35.520]  the expert on that the investigative reporter and she continues to join us here in this segment
[01:56:35.520 --> 01:56:42.640]  and the next so kelly uh are you open to taking some calls yeah mike i i wanted to just uh
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:48.800]  insert something there this is very interesting this uh this uh breaking news that uh uh uh
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:54.800]  from paul craig robinson um you know that was one of the first questions i asked the day that it
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:59.920]  happened was well what about the video camera at the school every school has video cameras
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:04.960]  exactly in this in this day and age um and if you had a rifle they would have released that video
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:12.640]  footage already but even more so i remember and i'm pretty sure anyway watching the corner uh the
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:17.920]  day give the give the breakdown uh as delicately as he could but i remember him saying either high
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:23.840]  power powered shot so this is very interesting i'm i'm i'm very interested to see what he has to
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:31.280]  say about this well yeah the corner the corner uh may maybe that that's a kind of a general term
[01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:37.280]  to say a high powered shot that could be nine millimeter plus p rounds that doesn't mean uh a
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:44.240]  rifle round necessarily and we've seen how the media has gotten their hands on the school videos
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:49.360]  of every other school shooting because they use that as propaganda to show the the kids with the
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:56.000]  rifles and the guns but wow we have no video from this shooting yeah why is that thing i asked myself
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:58:00.560]  when i was watching all this well we're where's the video yeah well we're looking at it on on
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:06.240]  prisonplanet.tv viewers are seeing the footage from the Columbine shooting and and i remember not
[01:58:06.240 --> 01:58:12.080]  too long ago watching some of the footage from the may 1st 2001 shooting that was patterned
[01:58:12.080 --> 01:58:17.840]  after Columbine they released that video because that that used uh i think some kind of a shotgun and
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:23.040]  some kind of a i think an m1a rifle or something so they released that but anyway stay with us
[01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:29.760]  Kelly sorry to get much talk in this break but we'll be right back in just one minute or so
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:35.120]  with more with Kelly O'Mara and more discussion on psychiatric drugs so stay with us this is
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:45.200]  the alex jones show we'll be right back after this short break you are listening to GCN visit
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:59:02.080]  gcnlive.com today big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:16.640]  he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones it occurs to me
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:25.040]  that just after the 9-11 staged event the federal government went around confiscating all the video
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:32.800]  footage from every every source imaginable but especially all the videos showing the strike
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:38.560]  on the pentagon which the government said was an airplane but most people have now figured out it
[01:59:38.560 --> 01:59:44.480]  was probably a cruise missile of some of some sort but we don't know for sure because all the video
[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:50.800]  has been confiscated and never shown to the american public why is that once because the video
[01:59:50.800 --> 01:59:55.280]  shows something that contradicts the government's story that's why it's kind of obvious you have to
[01:59:55.280 --> 02:00:01.120]  be a moron not to realize that by now but now with the new town school shooting this raises the
[02:00:01.120 --> 02:00:07.040]  question that we're just getting into why haven't they released the video from inside the school
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:13.920]  to show the shooter with his so-called ar-15 bush master rifle now maybe maybe they will
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:20.080]  and if that's the case then okay maybe he did use it but the news reports we're hearing today are
[02:00:20.080 --> 02:00:25.200]  that he left it in the car it wasn't even used in the shooting and they're not releasing the video
[02:00:25.200 --> 02:00:30.800]  so why wouldn't they release the video especially as it would further their gun control agenda why
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:35.120]  would they keep it a secret they released all the other school shooting videos in any case we are
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:40.320]  continuing with kelly o'Mara the author of psyched out who is an expert on psychiatric drugs and the
[02:00:40.320 --> 02:00:45.840]  side effects in school shootings and she continues with us on the phone right now and kelly any
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:52.720]  additional comments before we start to take calls well back to this new town uh any hook uh
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:59.440]  you know the video would be interesting from the standpoint of if he had a rifle the question
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:06.400]  would be why was why did they let him in right number one come on in if he didn't have a rifle
[02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:13.040]  and he and obviously no no guns were visible you know to the people seeing the camera whatever
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:21.920]  um then did they know him to let him in did they know him in other words they let him yeah they
[02:01:21.920 --> 02:01:27.680]  did know him okay so they let him in okay yeah they let him in but but remember we went through
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:33.760]  this whole several days of there's no connection between you know him and and sandy hook there's
[02:01:33.760 --> 02:01:39.360]  no connection between his mother and sandy hook so i mean what what i'm getting at is we really
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:46.480]  don't know anything concrete right all this time and this is a long time no we only know
[02:01:46.480 --> 02:01:52.320]  the things that they want us to know half of which are lives uh in in any in any case but yeah it's
[02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:56.400]  frustrating it's very frustrating well yeah and i'm sure there must be people listening who are
[02:01:56.400 --> 02:02:01.440]  saying well you know how dare you try to ask for the video of the shooting you know you have to
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:06.400]  honor the dead children well wait a minute the gun grabbers aren't honoring the dead children
[02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:10.960]  they're using those dead children to pass their political agenda their anti-american traitorous
[02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:16.000]  agenda they're not honoring the dead children at all all we want to know is the truth we don't
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:21.200]  need to show the actual children those can be mosaic out of the video we don't need to show them
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:27.600]  what we need to see is did this shooter actually have a rifle on him or was is that another piece
[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:34.960]  of fiction out of this vast collage of fiction right and again i mean i think the people have to
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:40.320]  understand the whole purpose behind doing an investigation of something like this hopefully
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:46.960]  is to make sure it doesn't happen again so it's important to get all the truth you know not just
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:52.480]  pieces parts um that that that they want to give us that's right and they haven't shown us the rifle
[02:02:52.480 --> 02:02:57.200]  they haven't shown us the ballistics reports they haven't shown us any of the brass from the
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:03:02.720]  the rifle they haven't they haven't even actually shown us much of anything and in fact i think that

[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:14.080]  a side you're listening to alex jones all right so here's how it works anytime the government
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:21.360]  wants to ban something some objects some item all they have to do is they go into a school
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:27.520]  stage a massacre of innocent children and then they just throw that object on the floor and
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:33.760]  say that did it they want to ban slingshots they can just massacre a bunch of children or plant
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:39.200]  bombs and then throw a bunch of slingshots on the floor or knives they can go in slash a bunch of
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:43.840]  innocent victims and then just throw some knives on the ground and find a patsy to blame for it and
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:51.600]  then say aha knives killed the children we have to ban knives have to ban swords have to ban blow
[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:57.600]  guns it we can have a blow gun massacre in america i'm not trying to make fun of the massacre what
[02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:05.520]  i'm trying to do is point out the utter insanely idiotic manipulation that is taking place here
[02:08:05.520 --> 02:08:12.000]  now those children's lives should never have been lost but nor should those in oklahoma
[02:08:12.000 --> 02:08:16.080]  city have been lost nor should those in aurora colorado have been lost and they were all lost i
[02:08:16.080 --> 02:08:21.840]  think the evidence clearly shows by a planned engineered event with the political purpose
[02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:26.320]  of blaming a particular object that's the way it works in america today but anyway
[02:08:26.320 --> 02:08:31.600]  we are continuing with calls now for kelly o'Mara on the issue of psychiatric drugs and the
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:36.560]  relationship between psych drugs and violent shooters you are you ready now kelly you ready
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:42.000]  to take some calls all right here we go daniel in washington thank you for holding you are on
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:48.560]  the air with kelly go ahead with the question please hello first time caller uh i have a question
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:53.840]  i've been doing a lot of researching upon how this kid's face was looking and all that stuff
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:58.880]  um i've done some research on bath salt and bath salt has a chemical reaction with the brain
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:04.400]  that cause hallucinations is it a possibility that that could have had any action with uh
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:10.800]  the way that this kid did what he did well uh we don't know there's no official report of what he
[02:09:10.800 --> 02:09:15.760]  was on and by bath salts you mean the illegal street drug that's nicknamed bath salts i know
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:20.720]  you're not actually referring to actual salt that you put in your bath but uh kelly what what are
[02:09:20.720 --> 02:09:24.800]  your comments on that from the way the the the shooter looks he looks pretty psychotic but
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:29.280]  you know it's hard to judge people just by their facial expression what do you think well i think
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:35.520]  he looks malnutricious that malnutrition does anything um you know again we don't know this
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:39.760]  is the problem we don't know what he was on we don't know what he was diagnosed with we don't
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:45.600]  know how long he was on these drugs we don't know if he was just coming off of them if his drugs had
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:52.560]  been upped or had they been reduced i mean we don't know we don't know anything other than we
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:59.200]  can look at this and go okay it it seems to fit the pattern of the school shooting all right good
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:03.200]  good answer we we need more information thank you for your call daniel good question let's go to
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:10.400]  george in connecticut george thank you for calling you are on the air go ahead sir all right thanks
[02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:15.840]  a lot i just wanted to make a few comments that weren't related to the site and but i wanted to
[02:10:15.840 --> 02:10:21.280]  give you some clues i am from connecticut and growing up in connecticut newtown was always
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:27.600]  the byword for being crazy because they had the largest crazy house there until about 2000 and
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:34.320]  a neighboring town only about 15 minutes down the road was famous for felt house hats for
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:43.120]  about 140 years and their their uh math scott is known as the mad hatter or the hatters for their
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:48.960]  their teams so that gives you a clue gives you a clue what globalists like to take this theme
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:54.480]  including the the batman thing but the things i really wanted to make comment about everybody's
[02:10:54.480 --> 02:10:58.720]  talking about financial collapse if there's a financial collapse who why would we want to
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:06.080]  be disarmed when the police can't be everywhere good point and the second point is why don't we
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:12.400]  have a a a push for disarming the gangs in the country first and now if they can disarm the
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:17.200]  gangs we might consider disarming because that's a consideration and they haven't done such a good
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:21.440]  job with the drug war for the last 30 years so i don't know how they're going to do that so
[02:11:21.440 --> 02:11:25.280]  well you know where i'm getting with my point and the last point that i wanted to make well wait
[02:11:25.280 --> 02:11:29.680]  wait george wait before you move on i i had the solution i know how to disarm the gangs
[02:11:29.680 --> 02:11:35.040]  you have gang signs that say gunfree zone and you just hang them up in the gang areas and it
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:42.320]  works like magic it's a gang gunfree zone sign let's that's it let's sell them in the info
[02:11:42.320 --> 02:11:48.560]  war store that solves the gang problem senator feinstein we have your solution woman it's the
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:56.720]  gang gunfree zone sign magical powers i'm sorry go ahead sir and the last last point is this
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:01.680]  state they build about a thousand people in australia by confiscating the guns that people
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:07.920]  didn't want to give up that has a population of about 22 million six hundred and twenty thousand
[02:12:07.920 --> 02:12:12.400]  and if you multiply that uh that factor you would get out of that if you divided one thousand
[02:12:12.400 --> 02:12:16.480]  into that that thing and use the same factor and multiply the times of the united states
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:22.640]  that would come up with a debt of 22 000 i'm sorry that's 22 000 sorry my mistake i was
[02:12:22.640 --> 02:12:29.920]  looking at the world with 13 793 kills including children mothers men everybody now is that what
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:37.040]  their goal is another another uh maybe 12 000 or so uh raco's yeah very very good point but as
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:42.320]  alex described yesterday that is what they want they do want a shooting water breakout they want
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:47.120]  that kind of mass murder in america that's what it seems to be but i thank you for your call and i
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:51.440]  love it when callers have statistics too and and good numbers very good analysis there kelly what
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:58.720]  are your thoughts on what the college has brought up well it's interesting i can say what what's
[02:12:58.720 --> 02:13:03.920]  interesting about it i mean it's a lot of statistics there nobody's right he's right you know when
[02:13:03.920 --> 02:13:08.320]  australia banned the guns some people said we're not giving them up and and those became you know
[02:13:08.320 --> 02:13:15.520]  shooting wars so his point really is that is it just to try to save to prevent the death of let's
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:21.360]  say 20 children are you willing to kill 20 000 people in america and apparently the liberals
[02:13:21.360 --> 02:13:26.720]  say yes we want to kill all the gun owners they they they call for shooting the nra president
[02:13:26.720 --> 02:13:31.440]  they call for violence they don't kill if they have to murder 50 million american people as long
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:36.960]  as they think they can save two children in a school i say it's not worth killing anybody
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:42.160]  let why can't we have peace for all of us you know why can't we be independent liberty minded
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:48.160]  upstanding citizens in a free country and just leave it at that and you know sometimes bad things
[02:13:48.160 --> 02:13:54.000]  happen but that's what that's why we're talking about the psych drugs exactly all right well let's
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:58.560]  go to the caller then if you're ready for it yeah and we don't screen these callers by the way so it
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:03.840]  can be anything it can be absolutely anything so here we go michael in massachusetts michael you
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:10.880]  are on the air thank you for calling and uh what's on your mind oh i'd like to comment on the
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:19.200]  medication of children in general yeah go ahead they don't have any um free will as to if their
[02:14:19.200 --> 02:14:25.520]  parents push something on them so if i might quickly just interject with um like something i wrote
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:32.320]  in the break uh well yeah if it's if it's short and to the point go for it yeah the uncle sam pharma
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:37.760]  industry pumps kids on methamphetamine derivatives from elementary school onward teachers compel
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:43.440]  parents to believe the lack of interaction in school with somehow a deficit whereas a genius
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:49.920]  might be bored with base mental effort required to repeat what is written in the textbooks well
[02:14:49.920 --> 02:14:57.200]  there you go your thoughts kelly well i i agree i agree 100 um children are forced to take these
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:04.000]  drugs i mean they do not have the right to say no okay their parents can put these their children
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:10.320]  on these drugs and often the schools push it they they decide that if your child's not like everybody
[02:15:10.320 --> 02:15:16.320]  else because that's what really they want they want everybody to be the same um and if your child
[02:15:16.960 --> 02:15:23.280]  acts out in any way then you know they they call you in and you know you need to take your child
[02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:31.360]  to have a look at and of course you know parents uh believe doctors uh believe the nonsense of
[02:15:31.360 --> 02:15:38.160]  the psychiatric diagnosis and surprisingly to me in this day 15 years after columbine
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:45.120]  the parents are still putting their kids on what is the equivalent of cocaine uh you know
[02:15:45.120 --> 02:15:54.480]  am dhd drugs and uh it just blows my mind what about still doing it kelly what about the combination
[02:15:54.480 --> 02:16:00.880]  of these psych drugs which we know cause a kind of cognitive detachment from reality but combining
[02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:06.240]  them with these first person shooter ultra hyper realistic video games now where they are they are
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:11.840]  really murder simulators there's a new game that's just come out i watch the trailer horrified
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:19.280]  it's called far cry three and this game is a in my view a murder simulator you when you actually
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:24.320]  i saw the preview i haven't played the game but i saw the preview when you slice you sneak up behind
[02:16:24.320 --> 02:16:30.720]  an enemy and you slice their neck open with a knife and blood gushes out on screen bonus points
[02:16:30.720 --> 02:16:36.800]  appear on the screen like plus 10 plus 15 so the more people you stab and shoot if you get points
[02:16:36.800 --> 02:16:43.760]  it's how is that impacting these drugged up kids well you know look i don't know how old you are
[02:16:43.760 --> 02:16:53.040]  but when we were kids we played army and we blew up army men and um but today's i don't think there's
[02:16:53.040 --> 02:17:02.080]  a single study that supports that these video games are contributing to these horrific shooting
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:07.440]  incidents but but the difference is when you and i were kids if we played a game it was a third
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:12.640]  person thing like little plastic army men in a sandbox today they they you're actually sitting
[02:17:12.640 --> 02:17:17.680]  you're controlling the character seeing through their eyes you know it's like a first person
[02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:21.600]  training simulator and now they're coming out with these vr helmets that are ultra realistic
[02:17:22.240 --> 02:17:28.720]  total immersion in the simulation so that you know the parents the parents buy these things for
[02:17:28.720 --> 02:17:35.440]  their kids um which i don't really understand but but they do just like they put them on the drugs
[02:17:35.440 --> 02:17:41.840]  and you say what about these cocktail of drugs um that's the newest thing is kids are on on one
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:50.960]  minor brain drug they're on several yeah um and at that point you're literally changing their normal
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:58.080]  brain chemicals right and that's where you start to get trouble well kelly um i i want to thank you
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:02.720]  for joining us today where we only have a minute left let me let me plug your book here it's called

[02:23:00.880 --> 02:23:05.760]  jones show thank you for continuing with us alex we'll be here in just a few minutes with some
[02:23:05.760 --> 02:23:10.160]  big breaking news so you don't want to miss that it's a it's a big deal you'll want to hear that
[02:23:10.160 --> 02:23:16.160]  i can't wait to hear it in the meantime we had some great ideas you know the last segment we
[02:23:16.160 --> 02:23:22.560]  were talking about how to solve the gun problem in all across america guns in the hands of criminals
[02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:28.960]  it's very simple you just hang up gun-free zone signs in all the gang areas and the the
[02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:36.960]  magicality of the signs automatically eliminates all guns from the gang zones and of course if
[02:23:36.960 --> 02:23:41.200]  you don't believe that then you you're not sufficiently worshiping the liberal mindset
[02:23:41.840 --> 02:23:46.000]  because they believe that's how they work with schools you hang up a sign a gun-free zone sign
[02:23:46.000 --> 02:23:51.680]  in front of a school and the guns magically disappear as if a wizard spell has been cast
[02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:57.840]  over the entire school in reality the spell has been cast over your mind by neuro linguistic
[02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:04.240]  programmer obama but hey why stop with the the signs in front of the schools i i think we should
[02:24:04.240 --> 02:24:10.160]  all walk into the airport with the signs hanging from our waste that say molestation-free zone
[02:24:10.720 --> 02:24:16.720]  how about that have one have one hanging from the back that says latex glove-free zone
[02:24:17.600 --> 02:24:24.800]  you know just just to let the tsa know that this is not the appropriate zone to do what they do
[02:24:24.800 --> 02:24:30.240]  all right i'm not going to go in any more detail on that but hey if signs are magical let's let's
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:36.160]  just use them let's use them for our own protection let's have let's have tyranny-free zones like you
[02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:40.400]  hang a sign in front of your door tyranny-free zone and then when the feds come to raid you for
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:46.080]  owning a 22 pistol they'll they'll see the sign and they'll say we can't go in there it's a tyranny-free
[02:24:46.080 --> 02:24:52.160]  zone how about that all right enough uh enough satire but man it's all so ridiculous i can't
[02:24:52.160 --> 02:24:58.400]  i can't resist it let's go to a caller greg from utah who operates uh looks like kyah
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:04.160]  one of the new affiliates carrying the outstones show in utah greg uh you're on the air go ahead sir
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:11.440]  yeah i'm i'm i'm real i'm glad i got you on i mean on the out here because this is the only
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:18.400]  station that carries it to utah great but anyway i had a comment on this last uh uh subject and
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:26.000]  parents need to listen and listen listen very closely because how these drugs work is most
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:32.560]  most depression comes from a conscience a child and a child is very impressionable and he's learning
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:39.040]  how to deal with life and when you put them on these drugs that take the cons their conscience away
[02:25:40.240 --> 02:25:45.680]  uh you're creating a monster i mean this is a very strategic drug that's used to destroy family
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:50.960]  i've seen it in operation i've seen people changed their whole personality their whole
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:56.960]  count it's everything changes you're right and that is creating a generation of monsters yeah
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:01.760]  because it burns their conscience out and they try and tell them that there is no right and wrong
[02:26:01.760 --> 02:26:07.040]  it's just how you know what makes you feel good good good point all right the bottom line what
[02:26:07.040 --> 02:26:13.120]  what city are you based in there in utah not delta we're in central utah okay pretty much
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:17.520]  uh our this station covers all the way from salt lake city all the way down in the southern border
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:23.040]  and most places in between we got out the best coverage and you know for an am radio station
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:29.520]  out here wow great uh i think we're waking people up out here because i went i went into the
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:34.240]  against uh well just the sporting goods store the other day and and the poor guy is a friend of mine
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:39.680]  that works there he says it's just been hell he said he can eat all he does is fill out applications
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:47.280]  and sell again that was my question for you what what is the consensus there in utah which
[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:52.480]  tends to be a state of a lot of you know a lot of liberty minded individuals what do you see
[02:26:52.480 --> 02:26:57.040]  it right there with with not only the gun restrictions but you know psych drugs also
[02:26:58.240 --> 02:27:02.960]  yeah let's put it this way on one one deer season rolls around they actually take two
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:08.480]  a day and a half off before the hunt it nobody goes to school because everybody is preparing
[02:27:08.480 --> 02:27:15.360]  to go on the hunt yeah great i mean it's like a national holiday here yeah uh i i i've talked to
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:19.760]  a couple people in the school and they've decided you know they are concealed carry
[02:27:19.760 --> 02:27:26.640]  and they are going to uh announce that fact yeah carry in the schools and we are in the school
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:31.920]  well that story we just read that in the previous hour a town in utah let me see if i can find what
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:39.120]  this is but they they are going to train teachers to carry concealed in the classrooms in utah i
[02:27:39.120 --> 02:27:47.040]  don't know what city this is but it's in utah well yeah you know i i talked to someone who's
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:52.080]  pulled over the other day and the sheriff asked him you got a gun in your car and he says yes i do
[02:27:52.080 --> 02:27:58.000]  and the sheriff asked him is it loaded he says no and he goes why not exactly i had a gun
[02:27:58.000 --> 02:28:04.720]  instructor asked me that question one time too is it chambered uh no why not if if you carry
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:10.080]  concealed this should be chambered i mean right there in the in the proclamation for running you
[02:28:10.080 --> 02:28:16.800]  know the hunting proclamation it says uh you can only have a loaded firearm at a pistol you know a
[02:28:16.800 --> 02:28:22.160]  handgun in your vehicle in other words you don't you can't carry a loaded rifle right you know because
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.720]  that that would encourage poaching but uh yeah you're as long as you have permission from the
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:32.480]  owner of the vehicle you you can carry a loaded weapon are we gonna go to break gray but good

[02:32:26.560 --> 02:32:30.000]  him announce what he's going to announce let's summarize things in the meantime here's what's
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:35.360]  going on this is a summary of everything that's happened so far today on this broadcast we've
[02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:43.200]  got the facebook censorship of all political speech that is pro gun or pro second amendment
[02:32:44.160 --> 02:32:51.600]  we've got facebook shutting down multiple accounts including 9 11 truthers uh pro gun rights
[02:32:51.600 --> 02:32:57.680]  websites they shut us down yesterday we were able to get reactivated they shut info wars accounts
[02:32:57.680 --> 02:33:03.040]  down i think some of them have been reactivated since then but everybody's been warned that if
[02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:12.320]  you post anything else that facebook considers to be i don't know uh offensive uh liberty minded
[02:33:12.320 --> 02:33:16.320]  maybe i guess if you post a quote from george washington you're going to get kicked off their
[02:33:16.320 --> 02:33:23.360]  site now so there's that story there is more censorship coming i believe across probably
[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:29.200]  search engines and other social networks so watch for that then we've got the story that we really
[02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:38.640]  uncovered here today which is why is there no video footage of the the uh sandy hook shooter adam
[02:33:38.640 --> 02:33:45.440]  lanza a carting a bushmaster rifle around the school there and we found another news report
[02:33:45.440 --> 02:33:51.520]  an nbc news report that says he left his rifle in his car and it increasingly appears that that
[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:56.160]  rifle was probably not involved in this shooting at all or at least based on current information
[02:33:57.040 --> 02:34:02.080]  so why have they not released that video if he was carrying a rifle shooting children in the school
[02:34:02.080 --> 02:34:07.520]  they would have loved to show that video on the air to drive home the point that oh it's the guns
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:12.400]  it's the guns it's the guns that would be part of their of their gun control mantra so i'm shocked
[02:34:12.400 --> 02:34:15.760]  i'm shocked that we're not seeing that footage yet it must mean there's something in the footage
[02:34:15.760 --> 02:34:19.840]  that they don't want us to see and if he was carrying a rifle why did they let him into the
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:23.840]  school in the first place because they have security cameras and they have locked doors
[02:34:23.840 --> 02:34:31.360]  why did they let a 20 year old kid with a rifle into the school then we've got the issue of senator
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:38.960]  feinstein the sorry i just looked at her face for a second there i had to i gotta recover from that
[02:34:38.960 --> 02:34:45.120]  one give me some superfoods people um i'm gonna cover that up and just talk about her instead
[02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:50.880]  but she's pushing this gun control agenda that is calling for an eight off hitler style gun
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:56.320]  registration which of course is always followed by gun confiscation and now there's a new petition
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:02.560]  up on info wars dot com by paul joseph watson well his story covers it the petition calls for dianna
[02:35:02.560 --> 02:35:08.240]  feinstein to be tried for treason and we encourage you to go to info wars dot com right now check out
[02:35:08.240 --> 02:35:16.240]  that petition sign it and help raise alarm over people in the senate who are trying to destroy
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:22.400]  our bill of rights and essentially gut our nation's freedoms and take your freedoms with it we've got
[02:35:22.400 --> 02:35:28.400]  this report of the wrong man being arrested and dragged into a psychiatric hospital and put on
[02:35:28.400 --> 02:35:34.320]  schizophrenia drugs just because he resembled an escaped psychiatric patient that has come out now
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:39.520]  so you could just be walking down the street and if you look like a psychiatric psychiatric patient
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:44.400]  you can be arrested and forcibly drugged against your will we've got the other story of adam
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:50.160]  lands's body being exploited the dna harvested from his body so that they can create a genetic
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:56.320]  profile of what they call the evil gene yes so now you're going to be profiled to see if you have
[02:35:56.320 --> 02:36:03.040]  the evil gene and what another wonderful liberal excuse to abort babies they can do the evil gene
[02:36:03.040 --> 02:36:10.160]  test before the child is even born and then if the baby has the evil gene they can justify another
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:16.800]  abortion but hey why even put a time limit on it you can abort a baby after it's born according to
[02:36:16.800 --> 02:36:21.600]  the liberals even up to three years old you can have a genetic test of let's say your two-year-old
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:28.000]  child and if that test comes back positive that that child has the evil gene you can do a post birth
[02:36:28.000 --> 02:36:34.800]  abortion according to the liberals yeah post birth abortion i know we used to call that murdering
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:40.720]  babies but today it's just a post birth abortion because everything's a word game now including
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:45.600]  the word assault rifle there's another word game even if this bushmaster was involved in the shooting
[02:36:45.600 --> 02:36:50.640]  which i'm now doubting it certainly was not an assault rifle it didn't have full auto function
[02:36:50.640 --> 02:36:55.920]  wasn't an assault rifle is a semi-auto rifle nevertheless that's a summary of where we are
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:37:01.280]  right now today all leading up to this moment where alex jones joins us right here in the studio
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:07.920]  with his big announcement and and here he is my kid is great to be here with you first off when
[02:37:07.920 --> 02:37:13.840]  you started the broadcast earlier today you were talking about the petition to go into federal court
[02:37:13.840 --> 02:37:19.680]  and begin the charges of treason against dying feinstein our country was born out of british
[02:37:19.680 --> 02:37:24.000]  citizens when the government tried to come and confiscate their legally owned firearms
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:31.200]  i think they had their uh blunderbust their long rifles their muskets all of it also had cannons
[02:37:32.240 --> 02:37:36.400]  the citizens had their military arms to protect themselves those were the right of
[02:37:37.040 --> 02:37:42.400]  of free men it's just that simple and when you look at diane feinstein this is a globalist
[02:37:42.400 --> 02:37:48.880]  operative this is a psychopathic authoritarian overtly evil person absolutely the biggest
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:53.680]  problem i hear from so-called conservative talk radio is it's how the liberals are dumb
[02:37:53.680 --> 02:37:58.240]  and the liberals are stupid and how they don't know what they're doing they all have bodyguards
[02:37:58.240 --> 02:38:04.320]  they're all into guns yep you know bloomberg owns his own helicopters and uh you know sits there in
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:13.120]  lobbies uh you know for uh more and more armaments and weapons for uh for his detail they are in
[02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:19.360]  control because they have a lust for power and they've gotten rid of all of our basic liberties
[02:38:19.360 --> 02:38:22.480]  they're trying to get rid of the first amendment right now you talk about what facebook's doing
[02:38:22.480 --> 02:38:26.640]  with the purge you talk about cyber security you talk about now how they said they're going to
[02:38:26.640 --> 02:38:31.280]  genetically profile people that are aggressive and not let you get government health care to
[02:38:31.280 --> 02:38:36.080]  have your child even if you have your own money if you don't agree to your embryo being government
[02:38:36.080 --> 02:38:40.480]  approved well hey they're they're they're they're getting the dna from lands of dead body to profile
[02:38:40.480 --> 02:38:47.120]  for the evil gene no no exactly this is all about we're all guilty we're all bad we're all criminals
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:52.880]  gun owners are our our murderers gun owners are racist gun owners are cuckluck's clan
[02:38:52.880 --> 02:39:00.960]  while the establishment itself are raving authoritarian trash and so it is not extreme
[02:39:00.960 --> 02:39:07.760]  to call her a treasonous treacherous uh larcenous uh witch when she's trying to steal the most bedrock
[02:39:07.760 --> 02:39:13.120]  of liberties if you can't be armed and because you lose your rights because somebody else does
[02:39:13.120 --> 02:39:21.360]  something bad you're not living in a free society so last sunday on the show last sunday uh on the
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:29.440]  broadcast uh a caller called in from arkansas and said you should have a petition for gunfree zones
[02:39:30.160 --> 02:39:38.000]  around politicians where they don't have bodyguards with submachine guns uh and with uh semi-automatic
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:46.800]  handguns or full auto or whatever they fetishize whenever i was at billderberg uh in uh 2008
[02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:52.240]  when hillary and obama drove in in the secret service motor cave about eight different uh big
[02:39:52.240 --> 02:40:02.960]  black uh suv's uh suburban's they lifted up with mp5 heckler you know h and k uh nine millimeters
[02:40:02.960 --> 02:40:08.720]  and the secret service it's on video lifted it up and pointed it at us we're standing there
[02:40:08.720 --> 02:40:14.960]  we're citizens with bullhorns they don't like that they were saying hey we're mouse satan our power
[02:40:14.960 --> 02:40:20.000]  goes out of a barrel of a gun like it was going to scare us and and we had marines who they had as
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:27.680]  the protective detail for the state department they had marines uh out there uh on the grounds
[02:40:27.680 --> 02:40:32.320]  and uh occasionally when they didn't think a camera is aiming they would put a rifle up an
[02:40:32.320 --> 02:40:38.320]  aim at us to intimidate us so this is a criminal government class that's taken our money built
[02:40:38.320 --> 02:40:45.440]  its giant military industrial complex infrastructure that isanauer warned us about who is now openly
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:49.600]  telling us yeah that's one point six billion rounds of let's do a document cam for viewers
[02:40:49.600 --> 02:40:53.200]  of that the document cam shots right over there uh by the mouse hold it right there and then give a
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:57.120]  shot uh for viewers out there of that that's the standard area right there to show it but yeah the
[02:40:57.120 --> 02:41:02.640]  government there you go guns are bad he's sitting on top of one point six billion rounds tens of
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:09.200]  millions of uh of guns uh armored vehicles tanks all of it but he's pointing down at the american
[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:14.640]  gun owner saying guns are bad he's he's bombing people tripling with bush kid the numbers are
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:20.240]  now out tripling drones saying it's okay to kill 200 innocent people to get one bad guy blowing
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:27.600]  children's faces off arms and legs off but then fake crying fake crying so so here's the big announcement
[02:41:29.200 --> 02:41:34.800]  last sunday the caller called in and i just got so busy you know over the week i didn't put it out
[02:41:34.800 --> 02:41:40.720]  but another one was put out about gun free zones around politicians saying they can't have guns and
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:44.320]  people can't have guns and and somebody else did it because we didn't do it and that's great it's
[02:41:44.320 --> 02:41:48.480]  got about six thousand signatures and uh adan solazar wrote an article about it that just went
[02:41:48.480 --> 02:41:55.120]  up at info wars dot com but above that red link is the curt nemo article and the petition i wrote
[02:41:55.120 --> 02:42:00.000]  this morning with curt and posted just an hour ago to white house dot gov people say well white
[02:42:00.000 --> 02:42:05.840]  house is going to ignore what you do doesn't matter the media the public sees it see they use small
[02:42:05.840 --> 02:42:10.640]  petitions to call for banning guns a week after saying look the people want it i'm going to take
[02:42:10.640 --> 02:42:16.720]  your guns the idea of a democracy versus a republic so we're going in there even if they ignore our
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:22.000]  petitions and using it as a focal point so there it is petition calls for gun free zones at white
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:32.080]  house and federal buildings and we're also uh calling again for all federal uh security forces
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:37.200]  feds for them to turn their guns in because what we've been told might and they've actually said
[02:42:37.200 --> 02:42:42.960]  the guns did this they say the guns come out and the guns come out at night and and they become
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:50.080]  animated like a uh cartoon and at midnight they dance around uh like uh something like fantasia
[02:42:50.080 --> 02:42:54.560]  and and and not on bold mountain go ahead well it's brilliant because it's using their own logic
[02:42:54.560 --> 02:43:00.560]  against them their their own logic says that uh the the gun freeze zone sign is what stops gun
[02:43:00.560 --> 02:43:05.680]  violence so and if if they disarm the schools the children will be safe they say so yeah you're
[02:43:05.680 --> 02:43:10.160]  right let's disarm the white house they'll be safe the communists took guns all over europe
[02:43:10.160 --> 02:43:17.200]  and in in australia and new zealand and england and wales and scotland and ireland in the 80s
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:23.360]  and 90s they would send in people on the middle patient list or government totes or known pedophiles
[02:43:23.360 --> 02:43:28.640]  providing pedophiles of the police and others uh or providing children to them that's come out with
[02:43:28.640 --> 02:43:32.560]  these characters we know they've been caught doing it before who go in and shoot kids up in a school
[02:43:33.280 --> 02:43:39.040]  so they have the same plan here in 1990 they come in they pass a law no guns period in schools
[02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:44.480]  not teachers not concealed carry not parents not anybody and then they advertise don't come to the
[02:43:44.480 --> 02:43:49.520]  school and kill people to get mentally ill people or their operatives to go do it then they use the
[02:43:49.520 --> 02:43:55.840]  kill zones see crimes gone down as we showed the fbi statistics precipitously all over the us because
[02:43:55.840 --> 02:44:00.960]  gun ownership's gone up the last 20 years they're desperate they're losing that idea of the government
[02:44:00.960 --> 02:44:05.840]  can't protect you and the witch feinstein who has her own concealed carry in her own bodyguards and
[02:44:05.840 --> 02:44:10.640]  michael moore whose bodyguard are going to rest at the airport with a gun they've got their guns
[02:44:10.640 --> 02:44:17.360]  their dominators the instinct of the dictator the instinct of the pig of the control freak the
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:22.080]  instinct of the king rat the instinct of the control freak the instinct of the psychopath the
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:28.800]  instinct of the malsey tongue is to take the guns so only they have the guns hitler stall and mal
[02:44:29.600 --> 02:44:34.480]  the ancient romans took swords from their slaves it's that simple so we've launched this just went
[02:44:34.480 --> 02:44:42.560]  up at info wars.com it is red linked our new petition written off of the actual unconstitutional
[02:44:42.560 --> 02:44:49.840]  federal law they've gotten the safe schools gun free zone act of 1990 saying okay you say no guns
[02:44:49.840 --> 02:44:55.280]  in an area makes it safe actually makes it safe for the bad guys we want the white house and every
[02:44:55.280 --> 02:45:00.560]  federal building to gun to be gun free and we want all of the government training centers
[02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:06.320]  since since you've disarmed those public schools we now want all the private schools like uh
[02:45:06.320 --> 02:45:12.800]  david gregory of nbc his kids go to with 11 armed guards or obama's daughter we want the guns from
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:17.280]  those private security guards gone imagine being david gregory last week with wane lopier the
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:23.760]  of the nra on television when when wane lopier said do what israel did when they got attacked in
[02:45:23.760 --> 02:45:27.360]  schools armed the teachers which they did the media later came out and said that wasn't true
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:32.400]  thinking we're dumb when it's on record then gregory came out to say that's preposterous that
[02:45:32.400 --> 02:45:37.840]  won't keep you safe knowing his daughters go to one of the only private schools in nc with armed
[02:45:37.840 --> 02:45:43.520]  guards yeah and he and then he showed what a 30 round magazine on the air which was a violation
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:50.240]  of dc laws so he becomes suddenly ensnared in his own gun control agenda exactly so i want to fire
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:59.920]  the uh bat uh searchlight up here for alternative media uh pro-liberty media out there everybody
[02:45:59.920 --> 02:46:03.680]  if you will go to info wars dot com we're also going to post this has just went up
[02:46:03.680 --> 02:46:11.120]  at prisonplanet.com our backup site if you will go there and get this and email it out to everyone
[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:16.080]  and email it out to local talk show host we'll get enough of a buzz going on this to really
[02:46:16.080 --> 02:46:22.720]  expose the hypocrisy of obama and the fact that he's protected with guns but that he doesn't
[02:46:22.720 --> 02:46:26.960]  want your children to be protected with guns and we're also going to add to this the video in the
[02:46:26.960 --> 02:46:31.520]  interviews of carrie jackson did with the texas superintendent who five years ago armed their
[02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:37.680]  teachers uh because they're local the closest police station 30 minutes away so they can protect
[02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:43.840]  their people we either go on the offensive or lose our second amendment and again i want to give
[02:46:43.840 --> 02:46:47.440]  credit here and talk about pierce morgan then we'll go to break i'll come back we'll do a final
[02:46:47.440 --> 02:46:51.200]  segment with the doug hagman you'll leave us and i'll come back for a full hour continuing with
[02:46:51.200 --> 02:46:56.640]  doug hagman and then phone calls but i want to make this point right now it's a great exercise
[02:46:56.640 --> 02:47:06.320]  in media disinformation and control that when the uh magnanimous mighty king of uh true media
[02:47:06.320 --> 02:47:12.560]  drudgereport.com last friday picked up on our white house petition and linked to info wars.com
[02:47:12.560 --> 02:47:17.200]  and gave us the credit we're not looking for the credit it just is wrong when it's not given it it's
[02:47:17.200 --> 02:47:23.520]  unjournalistic and it shows how scared the old dinosaur media is mike because he put that up
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:27.280]  now our listeners already circulated it had like six seven thousand signatures it was going to be a
[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:34.960]  news story yeah but drudge put it up and uh huffington post attacked it uh and uh the atlantic wire
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:40.640]  attacked it and some others attacked drudge but then the media picked it up i don't think of everything
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:46.800]  i've done in 17 years we've ever had some days three four thousand articles a day but only i
[02:47:46.800 --> 02:47:53.040]  could count on two hands the number that said hey it was info wars.com it was right it was credit
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:47:57.760]  again well it's not even about that it's that any other time they'll say who did the petition
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:03.440]  of course but in this case they didn't give info wars.com credit they didn't give drudge report.com
[02:48:03.440 --> 02:48:10.240]  credit which is just amazing and then they ran around and spun it and said we're anti free speech
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:15.920]  no he's trying to get rid of our right to the second amendment and self-defense he is a foreigner
[02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:20.240]  has a right to his opinion he doesn't have a right to come here as a subversive the reason
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:24.000]  i'm getting into this now is i didn't really talk about it yesterday and i should have i was so
[02:48:24.000 --> 02:48:28.320]  focused on the open announcements that they that they want to register fingerprint all gun owners
[02:48:28.320 --> 02:48:33.440]  and ban physically most guns but pierce morgan is not an american citizen he does not have the
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:37.200]  bill of rights if he wanted to bill of rights he should have fought for it like our founding
[02:48:37.200 --> 02:48:42.160]  fathers do well he didn't his answers are fought against it exactly but exactly the issue is he
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:48.320]  is clearly involved in what they call an attempted overthrow of our bill of rights the constitution
[02:48:48.320 --> 02:48:53.200]  because our bill of rights the constitution it is the government it is we the people it is the
[02:48:53.200 --> 02:48:58.000]  country it is what the flag symbolizes and so when diane feinstein attacks it she's a traitor
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:02.960]  she's engaged in sedition because she's a citizen even though she really is just a globalist operative
[02:49:02.960 --> 02:49:08.320]  an enemy within to quote cicero but to expand on that might under the supreme court rulings
[02:49:08.320 --> 02:49:12.800]  because within hours the wall street journal came out defended our petition still didn't give us
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:17.440]  credit but whatever and said no here's the supreme court ruling from the 70s with communists that
[02:49:17.440 --> 02:49:21.360]  would come here calling for an overthrow of the bill of rights because they always want tyranny
[02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:29.680]  once they get control it is subversion so he is guilty of subversion he is guilty of subversion
[02:49:29.680 --> 02:49:35.440]  20 seconds and it's just amazing that that it got this much attention so the goal was met
[02:49:35.440 --> 02:49:41.040]  to point we've got foreign globalist in here in our face trying to dictate and control our
[02:49:41.040 --> 02:49:46.080]  internal politics we'll be back with mike adams doug hagman and more i'm your host alex jones
[02:49:46.080 --> 02:49:52.560]  riding shotgun with mike adams of natural news dot com this is alex jones with five good reasons
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:57.680]  you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily

[02:53:10.160 --> 02:53:15.360]  who just announced a major news making petition and i'll let you continue with
[02:53:16.320 --> 02:53:19.120]  well again thanks for coming in and doing two and a half hours of the show i'm going to come
[02:53:19.120 --> 02:53:22.880]  back and do an hour with uh doug hagman i'm gonna do about 20 minutes with him and then
[02:53:22.880 --> 02:53:26.640]  get into some other news uh you know you were telling me i missed it even though i checked
[02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:30.560]  the site a lot drudgereport.com had the headline you were saying chival war they're coming for
[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:35.200]  the handguns yeah that was i think yesterday or the day before it said well war they're coming
[02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:38.880]  for your handguns well that is exactly what they're announcing for those that don't know
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:45.200]  they're saying that whatever guns you let we let you keep we're going to register and whatever
[02:53:45.840 --> 02:53:53.040]  guns uh that uh you know we take is basically up to us fingerprinting all of this they follow
[02:53:53.040 --> 02:53:58.960]  this exact pattern yeah once they register they then always ban yes i mean this is so hardcore
[02:53:58.960 --> 02:54:02.960]  and more and more you look at sandy hook i got to say it it looks like operation gladio
[02:54:02.960 --> 02:54:07.920]  looks like operation northwoods both of which were u.s government plans the stage mass shootings
[02:54:07.920 --> 02:54:14.160]  and blame liberty so we're going to report on that on monday i'll also be back live sunday
[02:54:14.160 --> 02:54:20.560]  four to six p.m with the sunday show uh breaking all of this down but in closing i just want to
[02:54:20.560 --> 02:54:26.800]  give credit to naturalnews.com drudgereport.com info wars.com all the real media that actually
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:31.440]  supports the bill of rights and constitution we're seeing an anemic pathetic defense of the
[02:54:31.440 --> 02:54:36.640]  second amendment we're finding out who the real uh by mainline republican sites uh we're seeing
[02:54:36.640 --> 02:54:41.360]  mainline republicans and drugs come out and say it's reasonable to turn your semi-autos in because
[02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:47.200]  the foreign banks pay for them they are the ones giving them the money so again i think this can
[02:54:47.200 --> 02:54:52.800]  be an even bigger petition to draw attention to the treasonous activity of the gun grabbers
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:58.400]  than the pierce morgan one oh yeah so so i never asked drudge to link to stuff but a drudge
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:01.760]  you know and crew are out there listening and if they think this is an important petition
[02:55:01.760 --> 02:55:06.560]  i know if it goes up on the mighty drudge it will get out there but regardless if listeners go to
[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:12.400]  info wars.com and get the article petition calls for gun free zone at white house and federal
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:18.080]  buildings and we go on to call for private schools attended by politicians to have their guns taken
[02:55:18.080 --> 02:55:21.360]  as well yeah because the politicians don't send their kids to government training camps where
[02:55:21.360 --> 02:55:28.160]  they've been disarmed now there's loopholes in the federal law to allow the arming of teachers
[02:55:28.160 --> 02:55:32.400]  and principals like texas is doing we need to and we're going to have that added to the article
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:37.680]  about the petition so people can get this out too and say this is the model but as you said we're
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:44.160]  illustrating their absurdity their hypocrisy their fraud of david gregory and others in this article
[02:55:44.160 --> 02:55:49.200]  that links to the petition and we need to get this petition even though opum is going to ignore it
[02:55:49.200 --> 02:55:56.000]  we got i'd probably say fifteen twenty million dollars of media coverage there are companies
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:01.680]  that try to get a story as big as that pierce morgan and spend millions and can't do it okay
[02:56:01.680 --> 02:56:06.720]  okay globalists can't can't can't get something out like that we're using logic and the truth
[02:56:06.720 --> 02:56:13.760]  trumps propaganda and lies and so if we the people this petition is even better again
[02:56:13.760 --> 02:56:17.200]  we've pointed out we got a red coat telling us what to do england's got a petition saying don't
[02:56:17.200 --> 02:56:23.120]  send him back he appears morgan is in trouble okay send us okay again we use their fake petition
[02:56:23.120 --> 02:56:28.000]  system that obama cherry picks against him if people get this petition petition calls for gun
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:34.000]  free zones at white house and federal buildings calls for his detail to be disarmed because again
[02:56:34.000 --> 02:56:40.160]  they say no guns means less crime of course even though that's not true this will really show their
[02:56:40.160 --> 02:56:46.160]  hypocrisy if we can get the corporate whore media the snot-nosed Atlantic wire to come out and go
[02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:51.280]  look at the pathetic drudging jones look at the pathetic's they think people are gonna sign this
[02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:56.080]  petition no one's gonna sign it that's what they first said friday night we can get that blew up
[02:56:56.080 --> 02:57:03.440]  in their faces exactly and again the goal is to have the media snot-nosed put us down and say that
[02:57:03.440 --> 02:57:08.400]  oh that's ridiculous saying take the president's people's guns it'll blow up in their face and
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:13.440]  it'll see we got to fight them hard on this we got to go after them yeah we've got to hit them every
[02:57:13.440 --> 02:57:19.520]  level that's why they went after wane lumpier and said how dare you how dare you say israel has guns
[02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:23.920]  to make your kids safe that's not true all right they had to lie because the truth would defeat
[02:57:23.920 --> 02:57:28.480]  them sorry go ahead that's the broadcast today overdrive with alex jones and doug hagman straight

[02:59:11.760 --> 02:59:18.240]  ladies and gentlemen i get so wound up when i have taken a few days off that really all i'm
[02:59:18.240 --> 02:59:25.600]  doing is pasting around my house like a like a bingle tiger and uploading news reports to
[02:59:25.600 --> 02:59:30.880]  youtube and prismplanet.tv and so i was kind of gibbering in the last 15 minutes because i got in
[02:59:30.880 --> 02:59:36.080]  the studio late because i was printing off the curtain memo article so i ran short on time breaking
[02:59:36.080 --> 02:59:43.120]  down our initiative to just use this this this white house petition system that they wanted
[02:59:43.120 --> 02:59:47.040]  to be able to cherry pick and say oh the people want to turn their guns there the people want
[02:59:47.040 --> 02:59:54.240]  you in takeover or the people want to you know have 90 tax rates or now we can use the white
[02:59:54.240 --> 03:00:00.640]  house petition to really backfire against the globalist and so i'm going to be breaking some
[03:00:00.640 --> 03:00:07.920]  of that down after doug hagman leaves us in about 20 minutes of homeland security us dot
[03:00:07.920 --> 03:00:14.320]  com that's their great website the reason i wanted to get dug back on was i was listening to the
[03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:19.840]  rebroadcast and i was so hyped up yesterday that we didn't really go over everything his source
[03:00:19.840 --> 03:00:24.560]  talked about about who they're going to go after first what they're going to do we didn't really
[03:00:24.560 --> 03:00:29.840]  talk enough about the facebook purges of now thousands of facebook's because of the backlash
[03:00:29.840 --> 03:00:35.040]  summer being restored any second amendment george washington quotes mohammed gondy quotes
[03:00:35.040 --> 03:00:45.360]  you're gone uh so it is it is really amazing uh what's happening right now but we've got to get
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:52.160]  on the offensive because it is the federal government that took the guns away from the american people
[03:00:54.400 --> 03:00:58.720]  in these gunfree zones and they have the blood on their hands and then advertise the schools
[03:00:58.720 --> 03:01:04.320]  as a place to go shoot and they're openly trying to disarm us they're disgusting we have to call
[03:01:04.320 --> 03:01:09.280]  them on the bluff now they are all in now we're going to go to break here in about three minutes
[03:01:09.280 --> 03:01:14.000]  but go into doug hagman of the northeast intelligence network doug give us a snapshot of
[03:01:14.000 --> 03:01:17.200]  what you're going to break down we come back to the next segment i'm going to really give you the
[03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:22.560]  floor to go over everything your dhs source told you because you were unable to get to all of it
[03:01:22.560 --> 03:01:30.480]  because of my hyperventilating well alex i'll tell you what the uh my source told me pretty
[03:01:30.480 --> 03:01:36.960]  much exactly what their plans are and what their contingency contingency plans are they've got uh plan
[03:01:36.960 --> 03:01:44.000]  a b c and d uh whereas one of my sources uh calls that a no single point failure so they're going to
[03:01:44.000 --> 03:01:50.320]  come at us on multiple levels it's just not going to be the legislative level it's going to be
[03:01:50.320 --> 03:01:57.440]  through executive orders through global initiatives through health initiatives it's really an insidious
[03:01:57.440 --> 03:02:02.320]  situation and they're not only coming after the guns alex they're coming after the mouthpieces
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:08.000]  is they're coming after the alex jones's of of the world and doug hagman's and and others who
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:13.680]  speak the truth that's the key here that's what people have to understand any political dissidents
[03:02:13.680 --> 03:02:20.720]  is in fact what they're going after they want to i mean we're looking at a communist initiative
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:27.280]  no two ways about it this is what's taking place so when we come back i can give you
[03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:34.400]  pretty much a step by step analysis as to um as as to what you know what they're going to do
[03:02:34.400 --> 03:02:40.000]  or what they intend to do a couple of their backup plans and how this connects to the united nations
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:46.880]  even so this is this is of course it does that's in 7277 the state department plan and they've tried
[03:02:46.880 --> 03:02:52.000]  this before now they think they're about to get it we're going under un rule under a un treaty
[03:02:52.640 --> 03:02:58.320]  absolutely like it or not and you know i i see on the on the on the internet where people say well
[03:02:58.320 --> 03:03:05.120]  the trees have to be ratified of course they however you know the end arounds being conducted
[03:03:05.120 --> 03:03:11.280]  by this administration should should make it clear to everyone this regime has no concern
[03:03:11.280 --> 03:03:17.040]  for the rule of law or the will of the american people it's their will that's what we're looking at
[03:03:18.480 --> 03:03:23.120]  that's it i mean we are going into a dictatorship of foreign megabanks that isn't just something
[03:03:23.120 --> 03:03:28.800]  we're saying they don't care they're going ahead with it and it will wreck this country which is
[03:03:28.800 --> 03:03:34.000]  their plan to consolidate power doug hagman uh and again recap when we come back what your source told
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:39.280]  you uh the intel about the source how big a deal this is and then after he leaves us in a couple

[03:07:47.120 --> 03:07:52.080]  but i also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that ak-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not
[03:07:52.080 --> 03:07:54.160]  in the hands of criminals
[03:07:57.280 --> 03:08:00.960]  guns will be caked and no one will be able to be off we can take all of them
[03:08:00.960 --> 03:08:05.440]  for many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in american

[03:08:34.800 --> 03:08:41.040]  top of the site petition calls for gunfree zone at white house and federal buildings that means
[03:08:41.040 --> 03:08:47.120]  diane feinstein that has her own concealed carry and five bodyguards with submachine guns they've
[03:08:47.120 --> 03:08:52.640]  got to be taken because the guns are what caused the crime we're not allowed to have guns to protect
[03:08:52.640 --> 03:08:58.960]  ourselves our children aren't allowed to be protected i trusted people in the school you aren't
[03:08:59.600 --> 03:09:03.840]  the petition has now gone live get it and get it out to everyone
[03:09:06.240 --> 03:09:11.200]  very important information up at info wars dot com there's another petition to try diane
[03:09:11.200 --> 03:09:17.040]  feinstein for treason we've got to get on the offensive or lose everything the next two segments
[03:09:17.040 --> 03:09:22.160]  i'm going to give dug hagman the floor to break down from his dhs source what we're facing but
[03:09:22.160 --> 03:09:26.080]  everything his source is breaking down is already there in mainstream news in pieces
[03:09:27.440 --> 03:09:30.960]  also the economist magazine that's like the bill berg groups mouthpiece
[03:09:30.960 --> 03:09:36.560]  is calling for a total gun ban all guns to be handed in the economist calls for repealing second
[03:09:36.560 --> 03:09:41.440]  amendment entirely that's a steve watson article but he links to their editorial or they call for
[03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:46.800]  that michael more says you are racist if you own a gun and you're white period and you're like that
[03:09:46.800 --> 03:09:52.720]  doesn't make sense it's they want division in this country they're not they want to demonize gun owners
[03:09:52.720 --> 03:09:57.360]  you're the new terrorist homeland security i told you 11 years ago was set up to go after
[03:09:57.360 --> 03:10:04.240]  patriots it's always been about that and now everybody's going to find out and i've seen so
[03:10:04.240 --> 03:10:08.480]  many comments most people are waking up but some are like i don't care i don't own guns
[03:10:09.840 --> 03:10:13.680]  a lot of people didn't own guns in china when maltook him but they found out that he wanted
[03:10:13.680 --> 03:10:17.600]  the guns to then do really bad things same thing with hitler stalin others
[03:10:19.280 --> 03:10:24.400]  it's what goes along with this it's all the other tyranny the warrantless wiretapping the
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:30.080]  checkpoints the powered attacks the power to destroy every time i see an image of diane
[03:10:30.080 --> 03:10:35.120]  feinstein come up on my website it just freaks me out guys punch up my screen real quick this photo
[03:10:35.120 --> 03:10:41.120]  of her but when you watch her on video i mean she just reeks of witch and evil and corruption
[03:10:41.120 --> 03:10:47.280]  and domination and she hates everything this country stands for why do we put up with these pigs
[03:10:48.640 --> 03:10:53.520]  these global issues surpers i mean listen let me explain something there are going to be millions
[03:10:53.520 --> 03:10:58.800]  of people that won't turn in their guns out of the 160 million plus gun owners and that's what
[03:10:58.800 --> 03:11:07.040]  the system wants they want to wage war on us and it will cause a war that's what all the analysts
[03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:11.040]  say it's what common sense shows and look the american people aren't just going to sit here while
[03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:15.440]  you go pick us off and drag us off to your dungeons our criminal government runs torture bases all
[03:11:15.440 --> 03:11:20.080]  over the world our country's gone and if we don't wake up to the fact we're in deep trouble and get
[03:11:20.080 --> 03:11:25.360]  out of the trance there's no future but i'm begging everyone on this friday transmission
[03:11:26.160 --> 03:11:33.200]  go to the website now and get this petition so the white house is gun-free so that all the
[03:11:33.200 --> 03:11:37.200]  government buildings and the private schools the politicians and their kids too are disarmed
[03:11:37.200 --> 03:11:41.840]  and if you send your kids to a private school that has a has armed guards then a lot of rich people
[03:11:41.840 --> 03:11:47.040]  do that no one's going to rich people are always going to have armed guards for their kids this is
[03:11:47.040 --> 03:11:52.320]  for the general public to be disarmed so the criminal state can absolutely abuse the population
[03:11:52.320 --> 03:11:56.720]  by the way herman von rumpi head of the eu's come out and call for global government to merge
[03:11:56.720 --> 03:12:02.640]  russia with the eu that was always the plan incredible there's even video of it the point is
[03:12:02.640 --> 03:12:08.400]  is that it's all happening you can't be armed inside a world government it's about the un treaty
[03:12:08.400 --> 03:12:14.320]  for this segment the next i'm going to sit back and give doug hagman who's got his dhs source similar
[03:12:14.320 --> 03:12:20.160]  to some of mine breaking down how they're going to drop the hammer what their plan is how they're
[03:12:20.160 --> 03:12:24.560]  going to use even outside of law mental health to go out for the guns what they're they already
[03:12:24.560 --> 03:12:28.560]  admit they're going to try to ban most guns and make us fingerprint for even a revolver
[03:12:28.560 --> 03:12:33.600]  or i mean the total licensure so they can then just stop issuing the licenses
[03:12:33.600 --> 03:12:37.920]  turning the second amendment to a privilege this is it so i'm gonna try to shut up doug for this
[03:12:37.920 --> 03:12:43.760]  segment the next you've got the floor give us your report break it down well thanks alex and
[03:12:43.760 --> 03:12:47.280]  i'll tell you what what's what we're seeing right now what we're seeing take place right now
[03:12:48.000 --> 03:12:53.680]  is something that we read about back in may and may eighth of of this year as a matter of fact in
[03:12:53.680 --> 03:13:03.280]  fact i was on your program uh in early may um about this like my dhs contact stated that the
[03:13:03.280 --> 03:13:11.600]  objective of obama during his second term was to is to disarm the american public obviously uh the
[03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:19.040]  the intent is as well was to exploit is to exploit shootings a shooting that would occur
[03:13:19.040 --> 03:13:27.360]  uh certainly we would use that event to uh create the environment uh the the fertilizing
[03:13:27.360 --> 03:13:36.080]  environment to um to to essentially um uh as as the create the ability for people to legislate
[03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:43.520]  or the the uh let uh the uh congress to legislate new gun laws uh now knowing and these people are
[03:13:43.520 --> 03:13:48.960]  not stupid people say that obama is is ignorant well he's not and he surrounded himself by
[03:13:48.960 --> 03:13:54.960]  by revolutionaries my dhs sources telling me look the bill heirs of the world the bernadine
[03:13:54.960 --> 03:14:01.040]  dawns of the world and those two in particular and gary jurid and van jones and susting all
[03:14:01.040 --> 03:14:05.120]  the people all the people you talk about and we talk about all these people are influencing
[03:14:05.120 --> 03:14:12.640]  influencing the decision-making process to the extent that the um uh the the the goal
[03:14:12.640 --> 03:14:19.760]  and objective is to disarm the american public so we cannot fight back against their objectives
[03:14:20.720 --> 03:14:26.640]  which is the total it's not the transformation of america it is the destruction of the of american
[03:14:26.640 --> 03:14:33.120]  people have to understand that it is destroying america they don't want america to survive
[03:14:33.120 --> 03:14:38.800]  they don't want to change america and if people understood the very people who are who are the
[03:14:38.800 --> 03:14:44.800]  cheerleaders for obama if the very people who are the cheerleaders for him understood that they're
[03:14:44.800 --> 03:14:50.080]  working for a seat at the at the table they're not going to have then things would be a little
[03:14:50.080 --> 03:14:56.240]  bit different perhaps but the according to my source within the dhs they are working very
[03:14:56.240 --> 03:15:02.000]  closely with the republican party as you have pointed out there's no difference between the
[03:15:02.000 --> 03:15:07.520]  republicans and democrats right now we know that they're working together against the objectives
[03:15:07.520 --> 03:15:12.480]  or against the against the constitution against the american people against the will of the american
[03:15:12.480 --> 03:15:18.960]  people the people think that there's a difference there's not the fiscal cliff it's all a matter
[03:15:18.960 --> 03:15:23.440]  of conditioning mental conditioning of the american public this is what's taking place
[03:15:23.440 --> 03:15:29.440]  so when the sandy hook shooting took place and by the way alex i i've got some concerns about
[03:15:29.440 --> 03:15:36.000]  that shooting i i i think i think you've covered some of them on air but i personally have some
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:40.160]  as an investigator for the last three years i've got some concerns about that there's some
[03:15:40.160 --> 03:15:45.440]  unanswered questions there and there's certainly some media manipulation there but that said
[03:15:46.080 --> 03:15:52.800]  the exploitation of that and the the hanging on the emotion of that using the bodies of 20
[03:15:52.800 --> 03:15:59.920]  children to advance a political agenda shows you the depth of the poverty that this this regime
[03:15:59.920 --> 03:16:08.080]  is going to so you've got the fine stones introducing legislation that's clearly unconstitutional
[03:16:08.080 --> 03:16:17.520]  clearly and has perhaps won't won't succeed but plan b is this plan b is to use for obama to use
[03:16:17.520 --> 03:16:24.800]  his executive powers to implement the agenda to require everyone that wants to own a gun
[03:16:24.800 --> 03:16:34.400]  to undergo just an incredible permit background type thing ultimately you won't be able to own
[03:16:34.400 --> 03:16:41.040]  a gun because you will be classified essentially as a political dissident or mentally impaired
[03:16:41.040 --> 03:16:48.880]  through ptsd because of your your wartime service or if you are on any type of medication
[03:16:48.880 --> 03:16:55.440]  that that could be classified that that that could affect your ability to handle a weapon
[03:16:56.000 --> 03:17:04.080]  not only mentally but physically in fact then we've what we've got here is a perfect storm
[03:17:04.080 --> 03:17:13.760]  for that particular uh the the the the the recipe i suppose if you will to um to create the
[03:17:13.760 --> 03:17:21.040]  inability or to create the um sorry about that alex oh no no doug doug you're absolutely on
[03:17:21.040 --> 03:17:25.600]  target there in your newsroom but just to interject here for a moment i'm going to skip this network
[03:17:25.600 --> 03:17:30.800]  break that's coming up to give you as much time as possible in the next 10 minutes or so but i
[03:17:30.800 --> 03:17:37.520]  want to add this point right here i have a globe and we're going under global governance the nation
[03:17:37.520 --> 03:17:44.560]  states are being annihilated the globalist admit under the state department plan 7277
[03:17:44.560 --> 03:17:50.480]  after they disarm the people they will disarm the militaries of the world and then only the
[03:17:50.480 --> 03:17:59.600]  un and nato will have a military this is a program this is a big idea this is a new world
[03:17:59.600 --> 03:18:05.120]  order and that's why the united nations on our east coast in new york city
[03:18:05.120 --> 03:18:14.000]  is going along with this program because they do not care what we think they've even got it
[03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:18.720]  factored in that there'll be resistance and they're just going to call us terrorists and all the
[03:18:18.720 --> 03:18:24.160]  fools that don't understand something nafta gat that that clinton said would be so great it destroyed
[03:18:24.160 --> 03:18:30.720]  our economy all these deals uh the people that do support obama are such suckers but i want to add
[03:18:30.720 --> 03:18:35.200]  this key point we've looked at the numbers congress has a nine percent approval rating
[03:18:35.200 --> 03:18:41.440]  government is universally hated obama romney that was all just a big staged election they don't really
[03:18:41.440 --> 03:18:48.240]  have a mandate they want to create the illusion that even though most of us are awake that that
[03:18:48.240 --> 03:18:53.920]  they do have a mandate or that we're a democracy and a 51 percent say turn the guns in that's what
[03:18:53.920 --> 03:18:59.200]  happens when we're a republic i want to state something clearly here if they try to physically
[03:18:59.200 --> 03:19:05.440]  take the guns or they start harassing gun owners and using extrajudicial executive orders that is
[03:19:05.440 --> 03:19:10.800]  criminal and if obama commits a murder he's still a murderer and if diane feinstein breaks the law
[03:19:10.800 --> 03:19:16.800]  she still breaks the law america has got to rediscover its distrust of government because we
[03:19:16.800 --> 03:19:25.440]  are on fire with tyranny we are collapsing right now and they don't care if it's unpopular they're
[03:19:25.440 --> 03:19:30.880]  going after guns we see the arrogance and i see democrats on youtube commenting hey alex you're
[03:19:30.880 --> 03:19:35.040]  crazy thinking we're going to take your guns so we're going to take your guns because that's crazy
[03:19:35.040 --> 03:19:40.880]  see the democrats on average are these control freaks who think of themselves mainline democrats
[03:19:40.880 --> 03:19:46.960]  as as powerful and they have power through the system and they fantasize like soviets about the
[03:19:46.960 --> 03:19:54.640]  mental health system these are very very sick people but they're a tiny minority of the so-called
[03:19:54.640 --> 03:19:59.040]  intelligentsia uh that you know all have government jobs and don't know how to tie their shoelaces go
[03:19:59.040 --> 03:20:04.800]  ahead no you're exactly right i mean they are seeing people have to understand that that the
[03:20:05.520 --> 03:20:12.080]  what's being thrown at us right now is asymmetrical warfare to implement communist goals for the
[03:20:12.080 --> 03:20:18.000]  purpose of the the the communist goals here in america is to is a stepping stone toward the
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:25.040]  one world order the new world order that george uh h w bush talked about on september 11th 1990
[03:20:25.040 --> 03:20:31.840]  that's i mean this is we are we are seeing an important step for that implementation take
[03:20:31.840 --> 03:20:37.920]  place right now and just so people understand this look uh just because i'm talking about obama
[03:20:37.920 --> 03:20:44.080]  right now that does not mean that it's simply obama only this has been as you as you know and
[03:20:44.080 --> 03:20:49.200]  as you point out in business your listeners know this has been in progress for many years for decades
[03:20:49.920 --> 03:20:56.960]  for a generation more than a generation actually so you know it's it's not a partisan issue it's
[03:20:56.960 --> 03:21:04.400]  not a political issue this is an issue that that has its roots in evil but uh and and my source of
[03:21:04.400 --> 03:21:11.760]  the dhs says is told me the flat out look you don't understand the evil that these people
[03:21:11.760 --> 03:21:18.480]  that the level of evil that that that uh exist within these people and the words that they use
[03:21:18.480 --> 03:21:23.120]  the words that are on the television uh for example fiscal cliff which you people think
[03:21:23.120 --> 03:21:27.520]  well that has nothing to do with the gun grab the gun legislation or gun grab or whatever
[03:21:27.520 --> 03:21:32.320]  it has everything to do with it they're putting us into an artificial collapse describe those
[03:21:32.320 --> 03:21:38.000]  are going to go after first go over these points we know about dhs settling all these sex claims
[03:21:38.000 --> 03:21:45.360]  with this command base of of dominant women in there doing things we can't even say on air and
[03:21:45.360 --> 03:21:51.360]  they settled i mean these are abnormal crazy people people ask why did hitler do things why do all
[03:21:51.360 --> 03:21:56.560]  these other leaders do bad things because it's what they're into these are deviant miscreant
[03:21:56.560 --> 03:22:03.040]  criminals they look at what communists and soviets have done and again these are banker funded communists
[03:22:03.040 --> 03:22:09.440]  they are they are they're going to look the first people they're going to go after are the people
[03:22:09.440 --> 03:22:16.400]  who are verb or vocally invisibly uh causing the trouble uh massing the troops so to speak
[03:22:16.400 --> 03:22:22.560]  people like you people like me or perhaps not i mean the answer to that is the turbo charge in
[03:22:22.560 --> 03:22:27.760]  their face if we bend over to them they win this is all a bluff with these chicken necks i'll never
[03:22:27.760 --> 03:22:35.120]  give in to feinstein and her flying monkeys and and normal normal we and we have to but but see
[03:22:35.920 --> 03:22:40.560]  one of the litmus testing and you brought this out earlier one of the litmus tests the beta test
[03:22:40.560 --> 03:22:45.520]  that were used uh that was used by the department of homeland security to test the will of the
[03:22:45.520 --> 03:22:54.080]  american people was is the tsa how much will the average american take and and and they used that
[03:22:54.080 --> 03:23:00.720]  tsa model to see can we nukem can we uh take nude pictures if you will love them can we
[03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:06.640]  feel them up see that's all part of that conditioning process but that's oh they're also looking at
[03:23:06.640 --> 03:23:11.680]  who's complaining and when i when i said that that there are lists being compiled of those
[03:23:11.680 --> 03:23:18.320]  who do complain about this treatment there would be people laugh but there are but they're using
[03:23:18.320 --> 03:23:22.800]  that oh no that actually came out and again you're supposed to get scared and go oh well
[03:23:22.800 --> 03:23:28.640]  then take my wife behind closed doors no these are drills to practice taking your husband at a
[03:23:28.640 --> 03:23:34.080]  checkpoint and you never see him again that they just want to get you phased in till you're going
[03:23:34.080 --> 03:23:39.360]  down for some questioning now and then you're never seen again this is a red dawn takeover
[03:23:40.480 --> 03:23:48.080]  yeah we this country as i was told is a captured operation we're already a captured operation
[03:23:48.080 --> 03:23:53.840]  we're already operating from behind enemy lines i was gonna say that this morning we've been captured
[03:23:53.840 --> 03:24:00.080]  we need to wake up and admit that if we have any hope exactly and and that was one one point
[03:24:00.080 --> 03:24:06.800]  that might my source really wanted to to uh to drive home to for for me to understand is the fact
[03:24:06.800 --> 03:24:13.920]  that that the people in charge right now are the enemy uh are the very people that we should be
[03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:20.480]  fighting against we have to uh put our foot down with respect to what's going on and preserve our
[03:24:20.480 --> 03:24:26.800]  constitutional rights bestowed upon us by our creator and demand mainline republicans come out
[03:24:26.800 --> 03:24:32.080]  and call them enemies they're not dumb liberals who want our guns because they care and they're just
[03:24:32.080 --> 03:24:37.040]  wrong they probably did the shooting all the evidence is there i mean these are they did
[03:24:37.040 --> 03:24:42.480]  fast and furious like larry pratt said if they did that they do anything this is a murdering mafia
[03:24:42.480 --> 03:24:46.640]  i'm risking my life to fight them because we can't give the whole world to these people
[03:24:47.680 --> 03:24:53.280]  but let's see the moment and and my source said this the moment that that you begin
[03:24:53.280 --> 03:24:59.600]  that i begin anyone begins to to go into the weeds in that area to question the official
[03:24:59.600 --> 03:25:03.760]  storyline of oklahoma city to question anything like 9 11 to question the shooting
[03:25:05.040 --> 03:25:12.320]  obviously we're nothing but kooks and and that's the official um uh they want to embarrass us
[03:25:12.320 --> 03:25:16.320]  into that because the known liars caught lying thousands of times told us so
[03:25:16.960 --> 03:25:22.800]  exactly and the lie is different at every level according to one of my sources the lie is different
[03:25:22.800 --> 03:25:27.440]  area at every level people have to understand that and really understand what that means because
[03:25:28.320 --> 03:25:35.920]  uh we are being a lot we're everything around us is a lie look bangazi that's a window to the
[03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:41.760]  the what this administration hours obama ordered stand down got caught doesn't get in trouble had a
[03:25:41.760 --> 03:25:47.840]  cia torture base down the street never stopped the torture uh gave over 10 000 missiles to al-qaeda
[03:25:47.840 --> 03:25:52.800]  i predicted they start shooting down airliners now they've done it and our media says isn't it great
[03:25:52.800 --> 03:26:00.960]  the rebels are shooting down passenger liners there's a bit it's like alka oh my god yeah yeah
[03:26:00.960 --> 03:26:06.720]  i got blood pressure measures in here my myself look in here here's the thing we are being set up
[03:26:06.720 --> 03:26:12.000]  for a perfect storm in three areas number one we will be engaged in a regional conflict that
[03:26:12.000 --> 03:26:17.840]  will turn into a world war based on the on our actions in syria because syria is the red line
[03:26:17.840 --> 03:26:24.160]  for russia number two the economy the dollar is toast lindsay williams basically said as much
[03:26:24.160 --> 03:26:30.400]  others jerald salente max keiser said as much we are going to face an economic collapse here in
[03:26:30.400 --> 03:26:36.960]  this country like we've never seen before they know that and they are timing this gun uh grab
[03:26:36.960 --> 03:26:43.200]  to make sure that we are we are defenseless when this happens and by the way when this does happen
[03:26:43.200 --> 03:26:50.640]  and it will happen when this does happen if you want food if you want medical care if you whatever
[03:26:50.640 --> 03:26:56.960]  you it whatever you need if you want shelter or need shelter you better bring your guns and oh by
[03:26:56.960 --> 03:27:04.320]  the way if you've got a neighbor or if a neighbor is in need that neighbor is going to be uh jeez
[03:27:04.320 --> 03:27:09.520]  that neighbor's gonna have to say well dug down the road here he's got uh uh he's got several
[03:27:09.520 --> 03:27:14.240]  weapons that he hasn't turned i'm now confirming reports that state police are pulling people over
[03:27:14.240 --> 03:27:19.600]  in rural areas running their plates they know you have no criminal record and they wait by your house
[03:27:19.600 --> 03:27:25.120]  and ask what guns do you have in there to fill out a terrorist report on you those little special
[03:27:25.120 --> 03:27:31.520]  reports they did and see that's all you're exactly right i've got the same reports this is part now
[03:27:31.520 --> 03:27:38.320]  part of standard operating procedure for for traffic stops for stop and frisks for uh for for
[03:27:38.320 --> 03:27:42.080]  various law enforcement and they're going to bring the tsa and as we talked mentioned yesterday
[03:27:42.080 --> 03:27:49.040]  they're going to bring the tsa in to facilitate uh this this really this criminal activity by the
[03:27:49.040 --> 03:27:56.160]  the the police departments they are going to commission to assist in the gun grab to assist
[03:27:56.160 --> 03:28:01.360]  in the oppression of rights they're going to commission the tsa the tsa is not they're not
[03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:07.120]  commissioned law enforcement officers we all know that but but after uh because of the need they will
[03:28:07.120 --> 03:28:14.240]  be so it's it it's crazy alex and you've played a great job in pointing it out but i gotta tell you

[03:31:58.160 --> 03:32:04.880]  it is simply an extension of what began in the old one it has patterned itself after every dictator
[03:32:04.880 --> 03:32:10.160]  who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time
[03:32:10.160 --> 03:32:17.120]  it has refinements technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction
[03:32:17.120 --> 03:32:23.680]  of human freedom but like every one of the super states that preceded it it has one iron rule
[03:32:24.800 --> 03:32:27.200]  logic is an enemy and truth is a menace
[03:32:27.200 --> 03:32:44.960]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:32:47.200 --> 03:32:53.040]  logic truth common sense individualism are menaces to the tyranny you know
[03:32:53.040 --> 03:32:59.440]  the last numbers i saw and there's some new ones out the number of combat suicides and
[03:32:59.440 --> 03:33:06.080]  military suicides are seven fold the previous record in the early 1970s at the end of the
[03:33:06.080 --> 03:33:12.800]  vietnam war now you're watching on prison planet dot tv now we can punch it up on screen here u.s
[03:33:12.800 --> 03:33:19.440]  soldier suicides outnumber combat deaths in 2012 well yeah you're working them too hard you're
[03:33:19.440 --> 03:33:23.440]  put them on and you're putting them on suicide pills i mean all those psychiatric drugs they
[03:33:23.440 --> 03:33:30.240]  put them on so they can later take the second amendment actually make them crazy and it goes
[03:33:30.240 --> 03:33:36.160]  over the fact from cbs news that that is that is happening ladies and gentlemen the globalists see
[03:33:36.160 --> 03:33:41.920]  you as animals as dirt to be used they're all about how to manipulate you the globalists don't
[03:33:41.920 --> 03:33:49.120]  even talk to you don't even see you as real unless you address them head on okay these these are
[03:33:49.120 --> 03:33:54.400]  horrible demons our country has been seized by criminals but they've got you so scared your kids
[03:33:54.400 --> 03:33:57.760]  are going to be killed because they're hyping it when statistically it's one of the rarest things
[03:33:57.760 --> 03:34:03.840]  in this country and only in areas they advertise is shooting galleries for their operatives and
[03:34:03.840 --> 03:34:08.880]  mental patients who are their operatives one way or the other they're all products of their system
[03:34:08.880 --> 03:34:18.720]  all fruit from their vine their tree and they are moving against us head long head long right now
[03:34:19.280 --> 03:34:26.640]  we are in a made a situation and i know i keep saying that i'm jumping out of bed at like 4am
[03:34:26.640 --> 03:34:32.240]  now ready to go to work used to it was 6 in the morning then 5 30 i mean i can't stop thinking
[03:34:32.240 --> 03:34:37.520]  about it because i know i'm right and and and sure logic you know you know it's all a fraud but
[03:34:37.520 --> 03:34:42.160]  the general public even if they know it's a fraud they just go well that's the way it is no
[03:34:42.160 --> 03:34:47.920]  that isn't the way it has to be speak out at church everywhere doug hagman i want to let you
[03:34:47.920 --> 03:34:53.200]  finish up with any other points your dhs source told you plus it's all confirmed plus more on
[03:34:53.200 --> 03:35:00.160]  solutions because don't comply with the system sabotage it any way you can legally and lawfully
[03:35:00.160 --> 03:35:04.720]  so that we don't have to do it other ways later but when the government's fully far and run
[03:35:04.720 --> 03:35:10.960]  and openly involved in tyranny and breaking every law pretty soon it becomes you know discretion is
[03:35:10.960 --> 03:35:17.840]  not the better part of valor discretion becomes cowardice and i don't want violence period but
[03:35:18.960 --> 03:35:23.920]  there's a rubicon that's crossed i guess when they really shut down alex jones doug hagman
[03:35:23.920 --> 03:35:30.400]  georgia noray matt drudge people like that we better use these venues now not just my instincts
[03:35:30.400 --> 03:35:37.440]  but my gut but also history my intellect tells me we better have maximum effort so so i'm thinking
[03:35:37.440 --> 03:35:41.920]  what do i do to give maximum effort maybe another video on the history of gun control
[03:35:42.480 --> 03:35:47.520]  on government killing 260 plus million people last century alone non-military combatants after
[03:35:47.520 --> 03:35:54.800]  gun control university of hawaii study uh what do i do i mean do i i think is what you said all
[03:35:54.800 --> 03:36:00.080]  these there's a small group of fools out there that at least give the dress up cover they say
[03:36:00.080 --> 03:36:06.720]  very small percentage of those are going to obama's uh coronation uh second coronation uh
[03:36:06.720 --> 03:36:11.120]  used to be an inauguration now it's a coronation of our imperial puppet and there are trendies
[03:36:11.120 --> 03:36:15.920]  who have their stickers and laugh you know i was jogging this morning and i actually had some guys
[03:36:16.720 --> 03:36:20.720]  um you know i could tell where obama supporters the way they acted like giggle and go look there's
[03:36:20.720 --> 03:36:27.680]  alex jones you could just tell by the innate weirdness and weakness and unreality and and
[03:36:27.680 --> 03:36:34.000]  unmasculinity of these guys you know i mean i mean they giggle and laugh at me but but uh you
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:38.560]  know the point is is that they look like they'd been putting a microwave oven and i feel sorry for
[03:36:38.560 --> 03:36:44.960]  these useful idiots who will soon be useless to the system their whole future being destroyed
[03:36:45.760 --> 03:36:51.040]  all actuary were a smaller and smaller group of servants of the system will be allowed to operate
[03:36:51.040 --> 03:36:57.280]  while all of our treasure and money and ideas are siphoned off to build this global corporate empire
[03:36:58.720 --> 03:37:04.320]  and just to have to look at all the servants and minions and and pimps of this system dug
[03:37:04.320 --> 03:37:10.480]  it's it's totally disgusting so so finish up your points and then what are what are your ideas
[03:37:11.520 --> 03:37:17.680]  for our maximum effort all of us to really get at these people i'm launching petitions because
[03:37:17.680 --> 03:37:23.200]  they get big attention to show their hypocrisy uh i'm i'm doing everything i can i know george
[03:37:23.200 --> 03:37:27.760]  norie last night was fighting hard for you know for facebook not the censor so they reverse
[03:37:27.760 --> 03:37:33.040]  themselves this morning uh but that's a test you that they're gonna wear a sound i mean what do we do
[03:37:34.240 --> 03:37:40.400]  well you're exactly right this is a war of attrition at some levels so what we have to do
[03:37:40.400 --> 03:37:46.000]  in and i talked at length uh with my source about this what can we do or do we throw our
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:52.000]  hands up now we totally commit we totally exactly that's exactly right and here's the thing we all
[03:37:52.000 --> 03:37:56.560]  have to under first of all we have to understand what the problem is you've defined it very well
[03:37:56.560 --> 03:38:03.280]  numerous times second of all we have to hook up with like-minded people and and and obviously
[03:38:04.080 --> 03:38:09.120]  developer plan and worker plan because it things that will will be tough especially when the dollar
[03:38:09.120 --> 03:38:17.920]  does collapse uh trust but verify trust no one uh they accept those people that you verify that
[03:38:17.920 --> 03:38:23.680]  are really on your side watch for people infiltrating your groups they are going to marginalize us
[03:38:23.680 --> 03:38:29.040]  before they take us down they're going to make us look foolish to make us look like fools
[03:38:29.040 --> 03:38:34.880]  on the internet before they they pull the plug obviously um so there's a value there to understand
[03:38:34.880 --> 03:38:41.760]  that but here's the thing the bottom line is don't comply don't submit to anything that is not
[03:38:41.760 --> 03:38:48.800]  constitutional don't comply with the illegal uh checkpoints the illegal search and seizures the
[03:38:48.800 --> 03:38:58.800]  illegal uh uh the grabs at the airports and that way by the tsa and if you really at the very
[03:38:58.800 --> 03:39:06.400]  heart of this we have to stop feeding the beast according to my uh my sort of my uh uh another
[03:39:06.400 --> 03:39:12.960]  one of my sources one of the biggest things that they're afraid of is everyone stopping paying
[03:39:12.960 --> 03:39:19.840]  taxes kind of like that that's been poland stop paying taxes stop feeding the beast that's what
[03:39:19.840 --> 03:39:25.840]  they're really afraid of because once that happens you take away their their their money um and and
[03:39:25.840 --> 03:39:34.160]  obviously we you know at that point the war goes very hot because they're after our money our money
[03:39:34.160 --> 03:39:41.840]  of course is a receipt if you will for our labor our time um they use our blood against us so dig
[03:39:41.840 --> 03:39:48.720]  in at every level speak out against them resist them demonize them because they are demons expose
[03:39:48.720 --> 03:39:56.640]  them discredit them at every level realize this is a war we have a total hot authoritarian takeover
[03:39:56.640 --> 03:40:00.960]  it's not just some creeping corruption anymore that's my next question to you why are they wanting
[03:40:00.960 --> 03:40:05.280]  to hurry and get it all done because of the engineered collapse because once they uh engineer
[03:40:05.280 --> 03:40:09.440]  the collapse they want to consolidate power but if they don't have everything batten down the
[03:40:09.440 --> 03:40:14.400]  collapse could be used as ron paul has said uh to wake up the people and take the republic back
[03:40:14.400 --> 03:40:23.680]  yeah you said it exactly there is an agenda here there is a an acceleration of events taking place
[03:40:23.680 --> 03:40:30.960]  for a number of reasons one of the reasons is uh where we find ourselves in the economic area of
[03:40:30.960 --> 03:40:37.120]  things another is the global state of affairs we really have a perfect storm right now with
[03:40:37.120 --> 03:40:43.920]  respect to what's happening in syria with iran in israel in the middle east as well as the economy
[03:40:43.920 --> 03:40:50.880]  they want to capitalize on this and they know that obama will be our last uh and i shuttered
[03:40:50.880 --> 03:40:57.200]  use of the term president so they want to get everything done and buttoned up now while they
[03:40:57.200 --> 03:41:02.320]  can because they've got a compliant puppet who's developed some of his own muscles but yet he's
[03:41:02.320 --> 03:41:07.920]  a puppet in the oval office and the people around him are the the fabian socialists the
[03:41:07.920 --> 03:41:14.240]  communists the the people from the antonio grant she's school frankfort school that's who's running
[03:41:14.240 --> 03:41:18.240]  this country and this is what we've got to look forward to but i'll tell you that the hs source
[03:41:18.240 --> 03:41:25.360]  said this these people are cowards as well if you stand up to them think of them as bullies in
[03:41:25.360 --> 03:41:31.520]  the schoolyard you stand up to them uh in many cases they will back down so definitely we've
[03:41:31.520 --> 03:41:35.680]  got to yeah let them know don't call the white house and say please don't do this say we know
[03:41:35.680 --> 03:41:40.880]  you're foreign criminals we know you're terrorist we know you're scum i mean it's important and it's
[03:41:40.880 --> 03:41:45.360]  not going to look police stations say hey the nsa admits they're spying illegally the government
[03:41:45.360 --> 03:41:49.680]  says they're coming after our guns that's a violates the constitution you better decide which side
[03:41:49.680 --> 03:41:56.320]  you're on i mean it's time to get aggressive folks yeah i couldn't have said it better and i'll tell
[03:41:56.320 --> 03:42:01.040]  you what i would urge everyone and but as i said before you don't certainly don't need my endorsement
[03:42:01.040 --> 03:42:07.280]  our endorsement but but i would urge everyone to follow what you are doing you are you are at the
[03:42:07.280 --> 03:42:12.800]  tip of the spear you've got a wide audience you've got a great reach and you affect a lot of people
[03:42:12.800 --> 03:42:19.840]  people need really to to uh get together under your uh shall i say leadership or guidance well
[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:25.520]  it's not even that i mean i i mean all i could say is we've studied history it's not hard to know
[03:42:25.520 --> 03:42:30.000]  what was coming now it's here and it's just going to get crazier and if something happens
[03:42:30.000 --> 03:42:36.800]  does to folks i see that as a major canary in the coal mine uh so if they set me up with drugs i don't
[03:42:36.800 --> 03:42:42.560]  use drugs uh if they god forbid you you know as that police officer called him yesterday
[03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:48.240]  he's told all his buddies you know if if they say you know that i killed my wife and burned my
[03:42:48.240 --> 03:42:54.160]  house down it's not true folks i'll never commit suicide i'll never hurt my family uh none of it's
[03:42:54.160 --> 03:43:00.320]  true if i'm found dead in a hotel room with a hooker folks i wasn't with a hooker uh you know
[03:43:00.320 --> 03:43:05.440]  people need to understand this isn't a game dug how arrogant are they isn't waking up the federal
[03:43:05.440 --> 03:43:09.200]  sources you've got because i know this is one thing that i think is welcome people up and
[03:43:09.200 --> 03:43:13.600]  bill berg was concerned a year and a half ago about this in libya they're concerned now from our
[03:43:13.600 --> 03:43:21.920]  sources that the alternative media forced the new york times la times and others to report that our
[03:43:21.920 --> 03:43:26.960]  government runs al-qaeda in libya and syria and it has them shooting down airliners and
[03:43:27.600 --> 03:43:34.800]  making father suicide bomb so how does that work for the feds who've said oh the government wasn't
[03:43:34.800 --> 03:43:40.800]  involved in 9-11 well we didn't say that criminal elements were al-qaeda was a creation of the
[03:43:40.800 --> 03:43:47.680]  globalist they've been used to take down the russians the serbs now america i mean is is that
[03:43:47.680 --> 03:43:54.560]  something you're getting back from your sources oh very much so uh the level the veil of transparency
[03:43:54.560 --> 03:44:03.200]  the veneer of of of the shadows look people are beginning to wake up and there is a level of concern
[03:44:03.200 --> 03:44:08.880]  among the people the higher levels the at the napolitano levels there's a there's a level of
[03:44:08.880 --> 03:44:14.080]  concern there saying wait a minute you know i i don't want people out there lynching me gonna
[03:44:14.080 --> 03:44:20.160]  you know but uh stringing me up from the nearest oak tree for what i'm doing so there is a concern
[03:44:20.160 --> 03:44:26.800]  there by shining the light of truth and at the at the at the higher levels however there's a hubris
[03:44:26.800 --> 03:44:32.400]  but at the mid levels uh exactly because the rockefellers and rothschilds the public didn't
[03:44:32.400 --> 03:44:38.400]  even know their names they're insulated even a napolitano which that she is and that weird
[03:44:38.400 --> 03:44:44.240]  group of deviant women around her who who just how does that affect morale though even with corrupt
[03:44:44.240 --> 03:44:51.520]  fbi people and folks they've hired to be to have weirdo women call you in and say you know do me
[03:44:51.520 --> 03:44:57.280]  favors and go live in the bathroom you ugly man i mean these are crazy people i mean why is even
[03:44:57.280 --> 03:45:03.440]  why are even the corrupt people serving such scum i mean when it's going to destroy the whole system
[03:45:03.440 --> 03:45:09.600]  i mean just so they can because the the globalist hate america and gun owners and christians so
[03:45:09.600 --> 03:45:14.960]  much folks they'll burn everything just to get to us i hope all you minions that serve the system
[03:45:14.960 --> 03:45:21.120]  and get invited down the local cfr and get invited down to the head mason hall and get invited
[03:45:21.120 --> 03:45:26.400]  you know down to the local fell reserve meetings you all think you're at the table because you
[03:45:26.400 --> 03:45:30.800]  got a hundred million dollars in the bank they're going to take everything you've got and you're
[03:45:30.800 --> 03:45:35.360]  going to be lucky if they just take everything you've got see when globalists steal from people
[03:45:35.360 --> 03:45:39.680]  and authoritarians do this they're then going to trump up charges on you later and they're
[03:45:39.680 --> 03:45:45.840]  going to kill you so so you know what's sick about this dean uh uh doug of a dean hag on the x-fals
[03:45:45.840 --> 03:45:51.920]  guy who i might get on the show so doug is that these guys don't know history 100 percent of the
[03:45:51.920 --> 03:45:57.360]  time the people that open the drawbridge to the traders are all the first ones to get gutted
[03:45:57.360 --> 03:46:05.040]  you know they may know history but they think that they could they think they can change it
[03:46:05.040 --> 03:46:11.600]  they've got this this uh this mental uh thought process where they're better than everyone else
[03:46:11.600 --> 03:46:16.720]  they're different than everyone else they're they're more capable they're they're capable of changing
[03:46:16.720 --> 03:46:20.960]  history that's what they're trying to do that's a hubris and and you mentioned about that uh that
[03:46:20.960 --> 03:46:29.680]  culture of uh of just perversion that exists look at that level everyone has everyone has
[03:46:29.680 --> 03:46:37.200]  something in their background uh and we saw that with uh with uh uh betray us when he was taken on
[03:46:37.200 --> 03:46:44.400]  at the cia they knew they knew that he was involved with uh paul abroad while they knew it and they
[03:46:44.400 --> 03:46:51.600]  held it over his head see that's that that's how the system now works and the more perverse
[03:46:52.400 --> 03:46:57.920]  that the situations are or that that that the people are that the better things are and and
[03:46:57.920 --> 03:47:04.480]  that's it's like a colegula and and that that was a term used by my my contact at the dhs
[03:47:05.120 --> 03:47:12.160]  like colegula and people have to understand the evil the perversity behind it well when you look
[03:47:12.160 --> 03:47:17.600]  at the stuff that most these top politicians are into they don't let you in the club you don't get
[03:47:17.600 --> 03:47:24.640]  the committee chairmanship unless you bare minimum have boyfriends and girlfriends and that's not
[03:47:24.640 --> 03:47:28.800]  usually enough uh you know to be a top general they tell you you've got a cheat on your wife we
[03:47:28.800 --> 03:47:34.000]  got to have photos of it but to get into the upper rings you've got to do illegal stuff and i don't
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:39.920]  think people get it that's why history you always have such evil people in control is because only
[03:47:39.920 --> 03:47:45.440]  they're willing to do really evil stuff to be in power and they want power so they can grab
[03:47:45.440 --> 03:47:50.160]  your little kid and rape him and cut their head off i mean i'm sorry but that's what you've got
[03:47:50.160 --> 03:47:55.600]  up there is a bunch of people who don't just like hurting little kids they like killing them you know
[03:47:55.600 --> 03:47:59.920]  sandusty was providing kids to globalists all over the country and look at who was all around
[03:47:59.920 --> 03:48:06.560]  him and who defended him top tv casters top sports casters politicians dhs people well you
[03:48:06.560 --> 03:48:13.120]  bet they're protecting him because he was supplying them little kids go ahead sir no you make a great
[03:48:13.120 --> 03:48:19.280]  point here because when we're talking about people like for example hillary clinton and people uh
[03:48:19.280 --> 03:48:25.680]  hillary her and people like her people have to understand the mindset is different you might uh
[03:48:25.680 --> 03:48:31.680]  you might not agree with what they do or believe in but it doesn't matter it's what they believe
[03:48:31.680 --> 03:48:38.880]  people like hillary clinton believes for example according to my source hey look uh she can change
[03:48:38.880 --> 03:48:46.960]  things uh through um the shall we say non-conventional means uh and when i say spells if you will
[03:48:46.960 --> 03:48:52.240]  think of witchcraft think of wicca think of good no no no no it's on record she does witchcraft
[03:48:52.240 --> 03:48:57.040]  that came out when the first year they were in office uh tony blair worships lucifer that's
[03:48:57.040 --> 03:49:02.000]  mainstream news france juan meteron that's what i'm telling you is that i've been to bohemian
[03:49:02.000 --> 03:49:07.680]  grove for a regular person it's a cheesy play those old men were in religious rapture these
[03:49:07.680 --> 03:49:12.560]  people are devil worshipers look at the guy that killed his mom his grandma with the hammer and
[03:49:12.560 --> 03:49:17.600]  then shot the firefighters turns out he was a devil worshiper they probably gave him orders
[03:49:18.240 --> 03:49:24.880]  we're dealing with a cult of devil worshippers and you're saying the dhs knows that absolutely and
[03:49:24.880 --> 03:49:30.880]  know it and they said watch for it watch for it to expand and i gotta hear about the devil worship
