[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  You
[00:30.000 --> 00:32.000]  You
[00:36.160 --> 00:40.080]  Twilight of freedom and a human world itself
[00:42.320 --> 00:44.320]  Twilight of our republic
[00:45.040 --> 00:46.640]  Twilight of
[00:46.640 --> 00:50.160]  Our families the twilight of every check and balance
[00:50.960 --> 00:53.680]  Updue process that has made us happy and wealthy and free
[00:54.480 --> 00:56.480]  We have traded
[00:56.480 --> 00:58.480]  our birthright
[00:58.480 --> 01:01.360]  Just like we see in the biblical story of Cain and Abel
[01:02.160 --> 01:03.840]  for nothing
[01:03.840 --> 01:05.840]  We've thrown away
[01:05.920 --> 01:07.280]  And now we're going into great bondage
[01:07.280 --> 01:10.800]  And I know many of you have been good hard-working people and you've been christian you love god
[01:11.520 --> 01:14.320]  For the reason this country is under attack because once they've extinguished you
[01:15.280 --> 01:20.400]  Once you've extinguished the light of god that shines out of you no matter what color you are you have that spirit
[01:20.640 --> 01:25.120]  The enemy hates you because we have that kinship brings us together despite our skin color
[01:25.760 --> 01:27.760]  where we came from
[01:27.760 --> 01:32.000]  If the enemy is able to extinguish enough of that light they know they're going to be able to take over
[01:33.120 --> 01:35.200]  The entire planet and that's where we are evil
[01:36.560 --> 01:40.640]  Is now out in the open that's why everything it says and everything it does is an easily
[01:42.160 --> 01:46.960]  Verifiable lie because it's a spiritual choice people choose to believe the lie
[01:47.920 --> 01:49.920]  They choose to buy into the fraud
[01:50.800 --> 01:55.360]  They choose to bow down to it adan Salazar wrote an article that is
[01:55.360 --> 01:57.360]  The most important covid story
[01:59.360 --> 02:02.400]  Of this entire globalist takeover in the last year and a half
[02:03.600 --> 02:05.600]  He wrote it last night
[02:05.600 --> 02:09.760]  And I'm not mad at anybody, but I sit around to see people I know and other folks
[02:10.880 --> 02:12.880]  And
[02:12.880 --> 02:14.880]  They don't even care
[02:14.880 --> 02:20.240]  If it's a little side issue boy, everybody just jumps right on it. It's so important, but when it's the holy grail of proof
[02:20.240 --> 02:25.840]  When it's the total proof that we'll overturn the lies hiding in plain view
[02:26.880 --> 02:28.880]  Well, then the story goes nowhere
[02:29.680 --> 02:34.720]  So if the story is to go anywhere and it's been reposted to the front page of the full wars.com
[02:35.520 --> 02:38.480]  I don't want the credit. I don't care. Everybody else should take the article
[02:39.120 --> 02:45.360]  Adon doesn't care. You should rewrite it. I don't care if it's Breitbart. I don't I don't care if it's always other talk show hosts
[02:45.360 --> 02:47.360]  I don't care if it's Bongino
[02:47.360 --> 02:50.320]  I don't care if it's Bongino. I don't care who it is
[02:51.760 --> 02:54.720]  But it's a holy grail of truth that will overturn all these lies
[02:55.920 --> 02:57.920]  And I'm just asking listeners respectfully
[02:58.640 --> 03:00.640]  If you care about your freedom, you care about the future
[03:01.840 --> 03:06.480]  To get the article I'm gonna turn this over to Oum for the rest of the segment so you can tell you what he has coming up
[03:06.960 --> 03:08.960]  I have a big announcement concerning
[03:09.760 --> 03:15.360]  Censorship and free speech and Mike Lindell and Fox News. You've seen that he's pulled his advertising from Fox News
[03:15.360 --> 03:18.640]  Well, I'll be giving you the rest of story of that at the bottom of the hour
[03:19.280 --> 03:23.360]  We've got just gigantic developments, but I've learned that if I just throw out a giant article right up front
[03:24.080 --> 03:27.040]  Nobody cares. What have I built it up for a few days? So we did Crimson Contagion
[03:28.480 --> 03:33.120]  We had three million extra people tune in that day and it actually changed the world and got to foreign leaders
[03:33.760 --> 03:34.960]  and got to
[03:34.960 --> 03:37.840]  Former u.s. Intelligence heads and you know really has had a big effect
[03:38.480 --> 03:42.080]  With what's left of our military the good faction to fully understand the takeover
[03:42.080 --> 03:48.720]  But they I told you they're going to declare a vaccinated terrorist. That's in the new national terrorism directive of tune
[03:49.520 --> 03:52.240]  The Biden side. I don't just say this stuff's down shocking
[03:53.040 --> 03:56.800]  I say they want to kill you and your family. That's their goal. That's bill gates
[03:57.920 --> 04:01.120]  And the global skull. So oh until folks what else you've got coming up when we come back
[04:01.680 --> 04:03.680]  I'm going to uh
[04:03.840 --> 04:05.840]  Go over a lot of this on
[04:05.840 --> 04:09.200]  Salazar article that's on the front page of info wars.com
[04:09.200 --> 04:12.880]  We're also posting it to the live show feed page
[04:13.600 --> 04:16.320]  um, and it's a planetary global bomb show
[04:17.920 --> 04:21.680]  There are more than 30 countries. We just wrote five of them in the article
[04:22.240 --> 04:26.080]  that have the highest vaccination rates on the planet for covid 19
[04:27.120 --> 04:30.160]  And many of them are islands. So they've been locked down for over a year and a half
[04:30.640 --> 04:35.360]  They have the highest death rates and the highest covid rates, but it's not covid. It's spike protein
[04:35.360 --> 04:39.360]  It's colonized your body. Talk about an alien takeover bill gates is pure evil
[04:40.080 --> 04:41.600]  uh, and so
[04:41.600 --> 04:46.080]  That has now come out ladies and gentlemen that it's places with the highest vaccine rate the highest deaths
[04:47.520 --> 04:51.200]  We already knew that but this is totally confirmed in Gibraltar and iceland in
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.160]  Singapore another area. So until folks what you've got coming up
[04:55.520 --> 04:58.500]  I will tell you what we have coming up right after this short break
[04:58.500 --> 05:06.100]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that I've ever done

[06:28.500 --> 06:34.100]  And ladies and gentlemen as we're live on this friday july 30th 2021. I thank god
[06:35.380 --> 06:40.340]  For giving us this opportunity not just staying live on air despite all the attacks against us
[06:40.420 --> 06:45.540]  But just to have breath in my lungs and vision in my eyes and and sounds in my ears
[06:45.540 --> 06:49.860]  Just to be able to live in this consciousness and to be able to face the test
[06:50.900 --> 06:52.900]  That we are enduring right now
[06:54.020 --> 06:55.540]  And that we can
[06:55.540 --> 06:58.740]  Be good enough to live up to god's expectations for us
[06:59.540 --> 07:03.300]  And that we don't have to live in a satanic hell hole
[07:03.780 --> 07:09.540]  That is being built for us right now by the establishment. Owen shroyer in studio alex jones on the line
[07:09.540 --> 07:15.140]  We've got all kinds of big covet updates here. I've got republicans some republicans
[07:15.620 --> 07:20.260]  Finally pushing back finally getting a backbone finally getting some fight in them
[07:20.900 --> 07:26.420]  And then we'll have some statements from republicans as well showing that is the case but
[07:27.140 --> 07:29.780]  As alex was just explaining in the opening segment
[07:30.660 --> 07:37.460]  The big vaccine push is still on they're only going to clamp down harder and more with every passing day
[07:37.460 --> 07:40.820]  Despite the fact that the most vaccinated
[07:41.060 --> 07:44.180]  Nations in the world like israel and like
[07:44.820 --> 07:50.340]  Iceland are having the biggest outbreaks of coveted. That's because just as the doctor guess we had on said
[07:50.740 --> 07:57.940]  The vaccinated people would be causing the mutations of a more deadlier virus and alex. We are now in that time frame
[07:59.220 --> 08:01.220]  absolutely and
[08:01.540 --> 08:03.220]  Oh and this story
[08:03.220 --> 08:05.220]  This story that's on info wars.com
[08:05.220 --> 08:07.220]  I'd on salazar
[08:07.540 --> 08:11.140]  It's into this and and this is the big issue that we've got a hammer. They're now saying
[08:11.700 --> 08:15.140]  Unvaccinated are terrorists that we shouldn't have food shouldn't have our children
[08:15.620 --> 08:17.620]  Shouldn't be able to leave our homes. We should put in camps
[08:17.940 --> 08:20.340]  So it's no longer speculation as I told you years ago
[08:20.660 --> 08:25.220]  Global government would use the fear of a virus to bring the digital world currency and then lock up people
[08:25.540 --> 08:30.740]  That didn't take the poison shots that the poison shots and reduce your fertility and kill you very slowly
[08:30.740 --> 08:35.380]  With a soft kill weapon, that's how they get away with it. And of course the side effect when it kills you quickly
[08:35.380 --> 08:36.100]  They don't like that
[08:36.100 --> 08:38.820]  But it's supposed to be so strong that it has already killed
[08:39.220 --> 08:42.340]  Conservably over a million people worldwide from the deadly shots
[08:43.220 --> 08:45.220]  But the real death comes later. So here's the huge story
[08:45.860 --> 08:50.660]  But I know as the listeners you're already at the speed. You're already informed. You already know this but the general public does understand this
[08:51.620 --> 08:54.500]  They hear Fauci and they see these other liars on tv
[08:55.460 --> 08:57.460]  saying this this lie
[08:57.620 --> 08:59.620]  99% of people dying
[08:59.620 --> 09:00.660]  have
[09:00.660 --> 09:06.660]  Not taken the cover shot and notice now even congress said give us those statistics. That was a week ago. They won't do it
[09:06.980 --> 09:08.020]  It does
[09:08.020 --> 09:08.740]  not
[09:08.740 --> 09:09.860]  exist
[09:09.860 --> 09:11.540]  It's off cook numbers
[09:11.540 --> 09:13.860]  Where they counted from the beginning of the fake pandemic
[09:14.340 --> 09:21.940]  Uh in january of last year into january of this year when the inoculations began and for the first month they did not ask someone
[09:22.820 --> 09:27.540]  Who had been inoculated who was sick at the hospital to do a covid test because that was quote the cdc director
[09:27.540 --> 09:30.340]  So that's how they took the statistics. So they did not put any
[09:30.740 --> 09:35.940]  Deaths from anyone else in the database to then create that fraudulent number that's now confirmed
[09:36.580 --> 09:38.580]  congress knows that everything these criminals say
[09:40.020 --> 09:43.460]  Is a lie now. Let's talk about the big giant elephant the room of the total proof
[09:44.180 --> 09:45.620]  There's an article
[09:45.620 --> 09:47.940]  on info wars.com and again, there's there's there's
[09:48.660 --> 09:52.500]  more than 40 countries, but there's about 22 that are really the most important
[09:53.380 --> 09:55.380]  island nations you name it
[09:55.380 --> 09:58.980]  But all of them are very isolated very authoritarian and very controlled areas
[09:59.540 --> 10:01.140]  Singapore
[10:01.140 --> 10:02.100]  Iceland
[10:02.100 --> 10:05.060]  Israel but but many of them are physical islands
[10:06.340 --> 10:11.620]  themselves or peninsulas that have huge walls on them and fences like gibraltar that's in the mediterranean
[10:12.580 --> 10:14.100]  Another police state
[10:14.100 --> 10:20.420]  So gibraltar is 98 inoculated talk about a police state and they have the highest covid rate
[10:20.900 --> 10:22.100]  number two in the world
[10:22.100 --> 10:28.180]  Let's continue Israel has some of the highest covid rates in the world and they are what eight out of 10 vaccinated 80%
[10:28.740 --> 10:30.740]  Same thing for singapore 80%
[10:31.060 --> 10:33.700]  And list goes on and on all of the countries
[10:34.180 --> 10:38.340]  With the top numbers of people sick and the top numbers of people dying and they're calling it the delta variant
[10:38.340 --> 10:41.060]  Which is really prion's protein spike crystals
[10:42.260 --> 10:43.860]  They are all the countries
[10:43.860 --> 10:49.300]  With the most death with the most sick people and we said this the vaccine is what will kill you and then they will say
[10:49.300 --> 10:54.980]  That it is the unvaccinated coming up in the fall. I said this a year ago. I said next fall
[10:56.340 --> 11:00.900]  They will put the lockdown back in predicted at all because I didn't predict it. It was in government documents
[11:00.900 --> 11:03.220]  It was in Canadian documents. It was in un documents
[11:03.860 --> 11:07.700]  A year and a half ago that that's an 80 and doctor that came out or almost a year and a half ago
[11:08.100 --> 11:12.420]  People said is it real and they all went over it. I said well, we'll have to wait for the dates
[11:13.140 --> 11:16.660]  Of the lockdown two and three and all the rest of it because canada was never going to come out of lockdown
[11:16.660 --> 11:19.220]  I said, let's just search engine parts of the document
[11:19.780 --> 11:22.820]  So I sat there and robbed his office for about two hours a year ago
[11:23.540 --> 11:24.980]  and we just simply
[11:24.980 --> 11:26.900]  Took pieces out of the document and
[11:26.900 --> 11:30.020]  Searched them and found out that it was all a un document
[11:30.420 --> 11:35.780]  That that the canadiens had just added a few paragraphs to for their country into their provincial systems and citing their laws
[11:36.420 --> 11:38.020]  And so again, folks
[11:38.020 --> 11:41.780]  There's a big article by Paul Watson about chris sky who thinks a great guy. I'm gonna get it back on the show
[11:41.780 --> 11:47.780]  But he's like everyone thinks chris sky is psychic now and there's tens of millions of views of him a year ago
[11:48.740 --> 11:50.100]  predicted
[11:50.100 --> 11:54.820]  Precisely what happened and again, I'd love to say I'm psychic. I'd love to say chris sky's not no
[11:54.820 --> 11:58.980]  We have the battle plan, but what's frustrating is when you go to the tweet that Paul Watson's linked to
[11:59.940 --> 12:03.140]  With one version of the video that has 1.7 million views on twitter
[12:03.540 --> 12:08.180]  Half the commenters are no, it's you chris sky and Alex Jones that are playing
[12:08.180 --> 12:11.940]  You told people not to take the shots. You told people not to lock down
[12:12.820 --> 12:14.820]  And so now it's your fault
[12:15.620 --> 12:21.380]  That all of this happened and we need to go back on lockdown now to finally end the virus and finally open things up
[12:21.620 --> 12:23.620]  So these people are in delusion
[12:24.500 --> 12:28.100]  And or they're being paid as we know millions of people have been paid as influencers millions
[12:28.580 --> 12:32.660]  Many people have like a thousand followers. It turns out are paid like five thousand dollars to put out bs
[12:33.780 --> 12:36.180]  And so they're all they're piling on saying no, no, no, it's your fault
[12:36.180 --> 12:39.860]  It's your fault, but we have the evidence that it's the vaccinated that are sick and dying
[12:40.420 --> 12:43.940]  We have the evidence that the vaccine's poisonous. It doesn't work. We have their admissions
[12:44.340 --> 12:47.300]  We have them so now everybody's got to push really hard
[12:48.260 --> 12:52.980]  Go out and demonstrate go out and protest call and talk radio call the c-span call congress
[12:53.380 --> 12:57.700]  Because if they get the new lockdown in they're then it never goes off again, okay?
[12:58.180 --> 13:02.340]  And they're bringing in the casual society. They're bringing in the contact tracers. They're bringing in the digital tracker systems
[13:02.740 --> 13:04.740]  This is the holy grail for their world ID
[13:04.740 --> 13:06.980]  And their carbon taxes. So please
[13:08.420 --> 13:14.660]  Everyone needs to write more articles in and around what adan has written explaining israel explaining singapore explaining islan
[13:15.140 --> 13:18.260]  explaining Gibraltar explaining all these other places
[13:19.220 --> 13:23.540]  Where they have the highest vaccinated they have the highest numbers sick and dying and it's people that were vaccinated
[13:23.940 --> 13:25.940]  Everything fouchy says is a criminal lie
[13:26.500 --> 13:28.820]  And we can literally call for his arrest because here's the deal
[13:29.220 --> 13:32.100]  They're going to blame somebody for this and they're going to kind of blame the chinese
[13:32.100 --> 13:36.900]  What i've explained is the chinese or just globalist clients who are in on this the communist party
[13:37.380 --> 13:40.900]  But it is the rocket cellar foundation the bill of millen the gates foundation
[13:41.220 --> 13:46.420]  It is bill gates and ted turner and and george floros that run this whole damn thing on record
[13:46.900 --> 13:49.780]  I told you guys from the start of a year and a half ago the rocket cellar foundation front of us
[13:50.180 --> 13:52.020]  I didn't just pull that out of my rear end now
[13:52.020 --> 13:57.140]  You notice the rocket cellar connect is in full command of the us and the un global response gates has been removed
[13:57.620 --> 13:59.620]  Because he was always our frontman
[13:59.620 --> 14:01.140]  you understand so
[14:01.140 --> 14:04.580]  We have to explain that we're under un rocket cellar foundation control
[14:04.980 --> 14:07.780]  But so rocket cellars created the united nation to 1946
[14:08.260 --> 14:11.780]  They financed the whole damn thing with british empire money and we're here
[14:12.660 --> 14:17.540]  And so this thing is a fraud a proven fraud and and and they are murdering people with this deadly shot
[14:17.620 --> 14:18.660]  And they are murdering the truth
[14:18.660 --> 14:23.700]  They're murdering our freedom and murdering our future and new lockdowns already announced in africa and asia and india
[14:24.100 --> 14:28.980]  Already causing tens of millions more to starve to death ladies and gentlemen then they turn around and say covid killed them
[14:28.980 --> 14:33.860]  So this is a master plan world genocide bigger than hitler right now
[14:34.020 --> 14:39.460]  This has already killed more people than hitler did we are literally facing hitler on pcp and steroids
[14:39.860 --> 14:44.420]  We are literally facing a psychotic mass murder operation in the open
[14:44.580 --> 14:47.300]  And I know this sounds shocking, but if you don't fully understand this
[14:47.860 --> 14:49.860]  And fully get this it's over
[14:49.860 --> 14:56.020]  I call on whistleblowers inside the justice department. I call whistleblowers inside google and big tech and all of it you know
[14:56.020 --> 15:00.420]  This is mass murder now. You know, we're right now. You've got the documents now. You've got the proof
[15:00.660 --> 15:02.660]  Do you guys want to be part of this?
[15:02.660 --> 15:10.340]  We need everyone to either strike or we'd everyone to to whistleblow do whatever you got because they're assaulting us physically right now
[15:10.660 --> 15:14.260]  And I and they want us to get violence so they can call us terrorists. I don't want to get violent
[15:14.660 --> 15:16.340]  But I want to go right
[15:16.340 --> 15:18.340]  maximum civil disobedience
[15:18.340 --> 15:22.340]  Now we have to move against these people now or it's over and for all of you out there
[15:22.340 --> 15:27.140]  They're delusional and think you're going to sit on the fence and ride this through and you're going to be safe that way
[15:27.140 --> 15:30.660]  Your fools we got to this position because the people have that attitude
[15:30.900 --> 15:35.700]  It's time to pick a side you pick Satan or you pick Jesus and it's really that simple ladies and gentlemen
[15:35.700 --> 15:37.700]  No one will escape this system
[15:38.340 --> 15:42.580]  All these fools, you know, like the Rockefeller grand son told
[15:44.340 --> 15:49.860]  Aaron Russo before he died about how we're going to have a global government to chip under us and to control us and the elite
[15:49.860 --> 15:52.340]  I'll be able to crowd for nobody else will
[15:53.300 --> 15:59.540]  Those so-called elites are the most deceived ones there are so I'm going to come back and lay all this out so much more at a big announcement
[15:59.540 --> 16:01.460]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell

[17:05.300 --> 17:09.940]  Thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to warn people
[17:09.940 --> 17:15.780]  I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year. Okay. I'm a double amputee and I have bacteria
[17:16.180 --> 17:20.340]  Infection on my lung that'll never go away living defense saved my life
[17:20.420 --> 17:26.100]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me living defense brought me back
[17:26.260 --> 17:31.700]  I wanted to just quote from the bible Jesus is saying as to where we are right now
[17:31.860 --> 17:36.740]  This is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they shall deliver you up to be
[17:36.740 --> 17:43.380]  Afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake
[17:43.540 --> 17:48.980]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another
[17:49.060 --> 17:50.660]  That's right where we're at brother
[17:50.660 --> 17:56.820]  And that's because god's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because
[17:56.900 --> 17:58.900]  God created this country
[17:59.540 --> 18:02.740]  But i'll tell you who's got five star ratings when it comes to customer service

[19:56.900 --> 20:00.020]  Really appreciate elin schroder the crew doing right down three solicitors
[20:01.060 --> 20:03.060]  That are tuned in as well
[20:03.700 --> 20:07.460]  And we've got some big free speech for you coming up at the start
[20:08.100 --> 20:10.100]  of the next segment
[20:10.580 --> 20:12.260]  but but oh and
[20:12.260 --> 20:14.260]  again
[20:14.260 --> 20:19.060]  We've been successful because I studied geopolitical systems. I studied the globalist own writings
[20:19.060 --> 20:24.020]  I read the books these guys put out. They think we're so stupid. They brag to each other as you know
[20:25.220 --> 20:28.820]  In their different books like tragedy and hope written back in their late 1960s
[20:29.300 --> 20:32.900]  Bill clinton's top mentor that had a political science at georgia university carol quigley
[20:33.620 --> 20:37.140]  Or zebrinski's books written in the 70s 80s and 90s and 2000s
[20:37.620 --> 20:41.220]  Where he said we just need to go ahead and kill the majority of the world population for the earth
[20:41.220 --> 20:47.380]  Uh, these people are worthless. They have no real lives. I mean these people are out in the open came good all all of them
[20:48.180 --> 20:49.620]  all the big top
[20:49.620 --> 20:51.620]  You know environmental spokesperson
[20:51.700 --> 20:56.260]  And it's a perfect way for them to play god and then rule over us and then look they've got some points about
[20:56.500 --> 21:00.100]  toxic waste and people and all the rest of it, but they don't care about people
[21:00.660 --> 21:02.660]  This they don't care about the earth
[21:02.660 --> 21:07.380]  Which is an excuse for their power grab and people better get their minds wrapped around this or
[21:07.380 --> 21:13.540]  They deserve what happens to them. But here's the deal. I don't deserve to be forced to be inoculated my children don't and I don't deserve to be scarred to death
[21:14.020 --> 21:16.100]  And I don't give the the globalist the right to do that to me
[21:16.820 --> 21:18.820]  So if they're assaulting me
[21:18.820 --> 21:20.500]  And then carry out these criminal actions against me
[21:20.500 --> 21:23.620]  I have a right to do you to defend myself by any means necessary
[21:23.620 --> 21:28.580]  But I know they've got it set up that if we were to be violent it would turn them into martyrs. The last thing I want
[21:29.380 --> 21:35.380]  Is any of these people to be martyrs? I want to politically culturally destroy them. I want them to be the villains
[21:35.380 --> 21:40.340]  They are I want folks to know who Bill Gates is. I want them to know who the Rockefeller Foundation is
[21:40.340 --> 21:42.740]  I want them to know who Joe Biden is
[21:43.140 --> 21:48.660]  You know when he sets up there walking up to the press literally degenerating in front of them saying I just got my ass wiped. So
[21:49.780 --> 21:51.780]  But we have to physically not comply
[21:51.780 --> 21:55.940]  We have to physically not use their smartphones physically not take their digital IDs
[21:56.420 --> 21:58.980]  Physically not submit because the holy grail for them
[21:59.940 --> 22:02.820]  Is the worldwide ID that the medical ID
[22:02.820 --> 22:06.420]  Medical ID vaccine passport forms the basis of it again
[22:06.740 --> 22:10.660]  This is all from the UK government all from the EU all from biden
[22:10.980 --> 22:12.740]  In fact, I have a clip we'll play
[22:12.740 --> 22:18.260]  Here in just a moment where he was on tv last night the press conference the puppet president biden. It's clip five get it ready
[22:19.140 --> 22:22.900]  And biden admits that yes, I want a mandate that's forcing you
[22:23.620 --> 22:26.900]  To take oh, but they don't call it forced medical tyranny. They don't call it
[22:27.620 --> 22:29.620]  Nuremberg code violation
[22:29.620 --> 22:32.820]  They don't say oh, we're giving you an experimental shot whether you like it or not. They don't say hey
[22:32.820 --> 22:34.580]  We've taken the virus site down
[22:34.580 --> 22:38.580]  Because it shows all the deaths they don't say hey this vaccine and the most parts of the world
[22:38.740 --> 22:40.740]  They don't say oh, hey look it totally failed
[22:41.380 --> 22:44.180]  The majority of those sick and dying have taken the shot, which is all admitted
[22:44.580 --> 22:49.140]  They don't say oh countries with 99 98 percent inoculation rate have the highest rates
[22:50.260 --> 22:52.260]  No, they just say you're crazy
[22:52.500 --> 22:55.700]  You're bad and he hops around a $10,000 suit
[22:55.700 --> 23:02.100]  Wearing aviator glasses talking about getting his butt wiped and you know what that's our fault that we let
[23:02.580 --> 23:04.580]  These demons do this to us. Well
[23:05.380 --> 23:09.540]  Now they know we're coming for them now. They know we've gotten all these laws passed so they can't still elections is easy
[23:09.860 --> 23:11.380]  So what are they doing?
[23:11.380 --> 23:14.420]  They're trying to gut the country gut the dollar destroy our name everywhere
[23:14.900 --> 23:18.420]  They're trying to run us in the ground as fast as they can because this is war
[23:19.140 --> 23:23.540]  But instead of us getting demoralized instead of us thinking we've lost. It's the opposite. They're gonna lose
[23:23.540 --> 23:27.620]  They've done this out of desperation and again, they're behavioral psychologists
[23:28.180 --> 23:32.660]  That's what all of this is done by very sick mentally ill satanic behavioral psychologists
[23:33.140 --> 23:36.820]  Who are trying to project their own mental illness onto us and gaslight us
[23:36.820 --> 23:40.900]  But if you just reject everything they say and everything they do then they can do nothing
[23:41.140 --> 23:45.700]  They're trying to put us into an alternate reality. That's why they tell us that we live in an alternate reality
[23:46.180 --> 23:48.180]  Uh, yeah, I do live in the real reality where I
[23:48.180 --> 23:53.220]  I read their actual policy reports and what they're actually planning not what they say
[23:54.260 --> 23:59.540]  They're going to do but what they actually say under battle plans. So here is the puppet chief the pretender in chief
[24:00.020 --> 24:02.020]  the reanimated corpse
[24:03.060 --> 24:08.340]  Saying that yes, he wants mandates. He's just seeing if it's legal. No, it's not legal under u.s. Law
[24:08.660 --> 24:12.100]  Not legal under local law. I don't care what the corrupt justice department says
[24:12.580 --> 24:16.820]  That same justice department says states can't do audits and they better stop the audits
[24:16.820 --> 24:18.820]  They just came out yesterday with
[24:19.140 --> 24:25.060]  Hair garland and said that so they're in panic mode. They're scared right now because they know
[24:25.700 --> 24:27.700]  They've bitten off more than they could chew and they know
[24:28.420 --> 24:33.940]  Three plus quadrillion dollars just in dollars a fake money's been created by these bankers to take control of the planet and buy up
[24:33.940 --> 24:35.940]  all the companies and businesses
[24:36.020 --> 24:38.020]  That's why before the world economy collapses
[24:38.740 --> 24:44.260]  They want to get us all on universal income so they can blame us for the collapse and make us buy into that next level of the system
[24:44.500 --> 24:46.500]  It's all coming to a head
[24:46.500 --> 24:54.100]  How would the un take over how would the fortune 100 take over look at google look at microsoft look at facebook look at amazon
[24:54.260 --> 24:57.860]  They've all what doubled profits this year already
[24:58.260 --> 25:01.860]  They doubled and tripled profits last year and the new lockdowns are here
[25:02.420 --> 25:08.420]  To squeeze you again and this time none of the businesses will reopen except for them. This is a criminal takeover
[25:08.420 --> 25:11.060]  That's why they're doing it on every damn front
[25:11.060 --> 25:16.020]  So will we take it or will we fight back here is the puppet in chief?
[25:17.620 --> 25:19.620]  Yes
[25:20.020 --> 25:25.300]  Why not um push for vaccine mandates in states private companies schools
[25:25.380 --> 25:29.060]  Do you want to see those entities pass the vaccine mandates?
[25:29.460 --> 25:33.380]  Well, I I'd like to see them continue to move in that direction and that's why I'm
[25:34.100 --> 25:35.300]  Pointed out
[25:35.300 --> 25:39.780]  I had asked the justice department to determine whether that is they're able to do that legally
[25:39.780 --> 25:41.780]  And they can't
[25:41.860 --> 25:44.980]  Local communities can do that local businesses can do that
[25:46.180 --> 25:51.060]  It's still a question whether the federal government can mandate the whole country. I don't know that yet
[25:54.420 --> 26:01.300]  So he's trying to make it sound like he's reasonable. Uh, yeah under the eugenics laws passed at 19 those 7 1918
[26:02.180 --> 26:05.620]  Started with market sanger in new york and the rockersville foundation. Same people look it up
[26:05.620 --> 26:10.580]  They were saying they're allowed to take a woman just because she didn't make good grades in school and cut her uterus out
[26:11.540 --> 26:13.380]  They were allowed to actually
[26:13.380 --> 26:18.020]  Kill people in some cases. So I mean, I guess they're saying they've got laws saying that they can kill us
[26:18.660 --> 26:22.820]  Uh, again, I'm riding a shot down with Owen shroy. I'm to come back with an important first amendment announcements
[26:23.380 --> 26:25.140]  a bunch of other news
[26:25.140 --> 26:30.180]  And then Owen you've got a lot coming up in the second and third hour today. Tell us what's coming up then
[26:30.180 --> 26:34.820]  Well, and let me just say in response to the clip we just played a biden alex
[26:34.820 --> 26:38.660]  You know that this is a very measured statement from biden
[26:38.660 --> 26:42.100]  They would they would do the federal mandates tomorrow if they thought they could get away with it
[26:42.180 --> 26:45.540]  They know that it's a direct violation of the nuremberg code
[26:45.540 --> 26:50.340]  And so they want to put that pressure on as he said local governments and local businesses
[26:50.660 --> 26:56.980]  So that they bear the burden when all these people are dying of the vaccines and it doesn't come back to biden's doorstep
[26:56.980 --> 27:02.980]  So if they do make that leap to make it a federal mandate, that means it's it's no holds barred
[27:03.380 --> 27:09.860]  They've they've they've withdrawn any semblance of trying to pretend like they care about you and they're just going to go full bore with it
[27:10.340 --> 27:14.100]  Um, but again, republicans are finally standing up to this
[27:14.180 --> 27:18.500]  I've got some statements from republicans like uh, ted crews and annie bigs and others that say
[27:19.300 --> 27:24.260]  Okay, we're gonna stand up. We're gonna fight against this. But you know, here's what's so frustrating alex and i'm seeing this a lot
[27:24.340 --> 27:25.940]  I'm sure you are too
[27:25.940 --> 27:32.580]  Whether it's uh commentators or talk show hosts or members of congress or whatever saying none of this makes sense to me
[27:32.580 --> 27:36.100]  I don't get it. They keep flip-flopping. This doesn't make sense. This doesn't make sense
[27:36.500 --> 27:43.700]  No, see it does make sense as soon as you accept the fact that this is an agenda to enslave the planet
[27:44.260 --> 27:51.540]  Then it makes sense if you think that these people care about you if you think fouchy and garland and biden and all these corrupt politicians
[27:51.620 --> 27:53.620]  Care about you then yeah, none of this makes sense
[27:53.620 --> 27:58.100]  But as soon as you accept the fact this is an agenda to enslave you then you get it
[28:00.420 --> 28:03.620]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology
[28:04.420 --> 28:06.420]  The criminologists all agree on
[28:07.140 --> 28:10.180]  And that it's criminals are extremely pathological
[28:10.660 --> 28:14.100]  Even more the general public they do the same things over and over again
[28:14.180 --> 28:18.820]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again
[28:18.820 --> 28:24.820]  Well, guess what it was anthony fouchy and eugenicist's globalist that
[28:25.860 --> 28:31.620]  Ran the rollout of hiv and the mistreatment of it with azt and other chemicals that actually killed more people
[28:31.780 --> 28:34.820]  That hiv and they were the ones involved in viral research
[28:35.860 --> 28:39.300]  Of viruses that would actually go attack the t-limp besides the body and create
[28:39.780 --> 28:41.380]  autoimmune disorders
[28:41.380 --> 28:47.300]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road
[28:47.300 --> 28:54.100]  That's why they need to roll out the covet 19 and the vaccine because now they admit the covet 19 vaccine destroys your immune system
[28:54.420 --> 28:58.180]  Basically giving you the equivalent of hiv. That's right ladies and gentlemen

[30:59.460 --> 31:05.540]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[31:05.540 --> 31:07.540]  So
[31:28.260 --> 31:30.260]  All right, welcome back ladies and gentlemen
[31:30.260 --> 31:36.020]  Welcome back i was going here on the road i'll be back today back tonight and i'll be back so
[31:36.660 --> 31:39.300]  I'll thank the crew for the great job that they are doing
[31:39.940 --> 31:45.700]  I want to continue with the globalist onslaught the globalist the population world government takeover plan the post industrial post human
[31:46.260 --> 31:50.020]  Operation that's been launched operation lockstep now known as a great reset
[31:50.900 --> 31:56.580]  You will now learn you will now see that this will never end until we arrest these people things only get worse from here
[31:56.580 --> 32:00.900]  And once people are starving in the streets, as is already happening in the third world
[32:00.900 --> 32:07.540]  They will use that starvation to control those giant masses of populations to politically hold everyone hostage
[32:09.060 --> 32:11.780]  So we're going to look back on these days this halcyon days
[32:12.900 --> 32:16.660]  Never completely said completely wonderful and completely good. Oh and shroyer
[32:18.340 --> 32:22.500]  Was really hitting some important points there at the last segment where we played the puppet job i was saying
[32:22.500 --> 32:27.300]  Oh, yes, I do want to mandate vaccines, but i'm not sure it's legal
[32:28.660 --> 32:30.660]  We need local governments to do it
[32:30.660 --> 32:37.700]  So they want big tech corporations. They want malls. They want music venues. They they want schools. They want the unions
[32:39.140 --> 32:41.140]  To do it in thousands of places
[32:41.700 --> 32:44.260]  So that you have to file thousands of lawsuits to stop them
[32:44.740 --> 32:46.980]  Of course the lawyers are so dumb down or so controlled
[32:46.980 --> 32:54.980]  They'll never actually sue the consortium groups and the un and the fortune 100 microsofts and and and warren buffett and bill gates and
[32:55.300 --> 32:57.540]  George soros that are involved in the world ID system
[32:58.420 --> 33:00.420]  It's so so you'll have the systems
[33:00.900 --> 33:03.700]  We'll have a few competing systems that all go back to the same database
[33:04.500 --> 33:07.700]  And then people will just sue the school district. They'll just sue the venue
[33:08.180 --> 33:10.980]  They'll just you know leave their church the churches are going to bring all this in
[33:11.300 --> 33:14.740]  they're going to be the tip of the spear of satan because they're so controlled by it and
[33:14.740 --> 33:17.220]  That's what the bible says what happened these times
[33:18.260 --> 33:21.460]  And so that's why they're trying to kill us with a thousand cuts
[33:22.020 --> 33:27.460]  And and remember always denying. Oh, there's going to be no global idea. There's going to be no medical vaccine passport
[33:27.940 --> 33:32.660]  Even though a year and a half ago we had all the documents from the Rockefellers all the documents from the bill gates foundation
[33:32.660 --> 33:36.020]  We do every bit of it how they were going to do it when they were going to roll it out
[33:36.100 --> 33:39.380]  What month they were going to do it and instead now people think we're psychic
[33:39.380 --> 33:44.180]  And the truth is everybody's a little psychic everybody has intuition, but this is an intuition folks
[33:44.660 --> 33:47.700]  We have all the admitted facts because the public act like
[33:49.620 --> 33:52.580]  Like like ignorant villagers or something. They're just superstitious
[33:53.220 --> 33:55.460]  they just go off whatever the media says or
[33:56.580 --> 33:58.740]  Go off anybody having knowledge like it's magic
[33:59.460 --> 34:04.100]  And and I guess knowing all these globalist documents. I guess is kind of magic. I mean hell
[34:04.100 --> 34:09.140]  If I wanted to spend my time spending money in the stock market, but I think the stock market's pretty corrupt
[34:09.140 --> 34:14.660]  So I don't do it. I mean, I would don't have to make tons of money. I mean, I've I've proven that I've sat there and told friends and family
[34:14.660 --> 34:18.340]  Watch what the stock does in a month or watch what that does and I say, why didn't you invest in it?
[34:18.340 --> 34:20.980]  I said because I'm not part of that Babylon system
[34:21.540 --> 34:25.140]  And it doesn't mean I'm perfect doesn't mean I'm not connected to a lot of things. We're all connected to the world
[34:25.460 --> 34:27.460]  But I'm in the world but not of it
[34:27.460 --> 34:34.660]  And I understand how the system operates and so it's here. This is a biological globalist takeover of humanity
[34:34.900 --> 34:39.220]  They want to play god. They want to populate the planet and they made the decision to do it
[34:39.940 --> 34:43.460]  They recruited massive massive numbers of people
[34:44.340 --> 34:46.100]  To carry that out
[34:46.100 --> 34:48.100]  Now let's talk about solutions and fighting back
[34:49.220 --> 34:54.180]  People will sit back and they'll say this is so evil. This is so out of control. Give it to god and I totally agree
[34:54.660 --> 34:56.660]  We can't beat ourselves up
[34:56.660 --> 35:02.020]  With frustration that this is so corrupt and and you know feel like we're guilty that was that we can't individually change it
[35:02.020 --> 35:03.700]  We have to give it to god, but
[35:03.700 --> 35:05.700]  What does the bible say faith?
[35:06.180 --> 35:07.780]  Without works is death
[35:07.780 --> 35:13.940]  If you truly love god if you hate corruption, you're going to be warning people are speaking out so that as things get worse
[35:14.740 --> 35:20.100]  Down the road. They're going to remember what you said and maybe it's five minutes before they get their head chopped off
[35:20.820 --> 35:22.820]  You know if we're not taking the mark of the beast
[35:22.820 --> 35:27.620]  You won't matter they'll still finally believe in god and understand this was a spiritual decision
[35:27.860 --> 35:33.780]  And finally not be delusional and turn their soul over to the truth. Turn their soul over to reality turn their soul over to god
[35:34.260 --> 35:37.460]  And I'm just sorry, but that's the way this is ladies and gentlemen
[35:37.460 --> 35:44.180]  I told people this thousands of times on air 26 years ago 20 years ago 10 years ago five years ago a month ago
[35:44.420 --> 35:47.940]  I know I'll be attacked now for saying all this stuff. People think I'm crazy
[35:47.940 --> 35:53.060]  But as it all unfolds as the new world order begins to launch these things people will finally listen
[35:54.020 --> 35:56.020]  And we've now reached that point
[35:56.180 --> 35:58.180]  But we don't have 20 years
[35:58.180 --> 36:01.540]  To get people on board for what's coming because now it's all accelerating
[36:01.860 --> 36:07.300]  And so every one of you that shares an article or a video everyone you shoot your own video every one of you that
[36:07.940 --> 36:13.620]  Promote your neighbor's video tell the truth or or or or when you see something happening and you shoot a shot of it on your phone
[36:14.180 --> 36:16.180]  And share that
[36:16.180 --> 36:20.580]  That's all human intelligence. The enemy doesn't want they want to just give you the propaganda
[36:21.220 --> 36:24.500]  And just have you sit there and receive it and just have you sit there and keep
[36:25.540 --> 36:27.540]  regurgitating in it everybody
[36:27.860 --> 36:28.980]  and
[36:28.980 --> 36:33.220]  That's that's not what you're going to do. You need to get your own research your own information about history
[36:33.860 --> 36:38.100]  Understand what the globalists are really doing and then start exposing them to everyone, you know
[36:40.820 --> 36:42.820]  And exposing the fact that
[36:42.820 --> 36:47.780]  And exposing the fact that again submitting to the globalist only makes things worse
[36:48.500 --> 36:53.380]  Winter people finally going to start saying no, that's a question. You've got to ask them because
[36:54.020 --> 36:58.340]  Giving in to having these chains put on you only makes them put the chains on tire later
[36:59.380 --> 37:01.380]  So that's why they squeeze and then release
[37:01.940 --> 37:07.620]  Squeeze again release again, but each time getting tighter. So by the time they've squeezed us down two or three times
[37:07.620 --> 37:13.140]  We'll be at a level we'll never be able to get out of and won't be resisting at the key moment when they finally break our net
[37:14.020 --> 37:16.020]  And we're entering that neck-breaking
[37:16.420 --> 37:22.660]  Area in the next year to two when they finally enforce these world IDs when people are starving in mass the borders are totally collapsed
[37:23.220 --> 37:25.220]  And they're going to hold us hostage and say now
[37:25.540 --> 37:30.820]  It's your fault. You didn't take these IDs. It's your fault. You didn't take these shots and even when you finally give in
[37:31.220 --> 37:33.220]  There's no food at the store
[37:33.220 --> 37:35.220]  And you go and you take the shots
[37:35.220 --> 37:39.540]  It's only going to get worse after that just like all these people that took the shots because they were quote heroes
[37:39.540 --> 37:43.140]  That was going to make them invincible and now they learn they're actually the super spreaders
[37:43.380 --> 37:46.580]  They're the ones causing it the countries that have the highest rates of inoculation
[37:46.900 --> 37:52.420]  Have the highest rates of death and disease because it's all a trap. It's all a spiritual delusion
[37:52.900 --> 37:53.940]  And so
[37:53.940 --> 37:55.940]  People make fun of me for fighting the system
[37:56.420 --> 38:02.900]  They ridicule because they've never been a man in the arena and they say oh Jones, you're never going to be able to stop these people
[38:02.900 --> 38:04.900]  Well, it's not my job to stop it
[38:06.100 --> 38:10.260]  It's my job to inform people and educate people so they can make a spiritual
[38:10.820 --> 38:13.780]  Decision that then a cultural economic financial
[38:14.980 --> 38:19.380]  Decision will come from I'm just to make sure people know there's a decision they have to make
[38:19.700 --> 38:22.180]  And I'm a tool of God just like everybody else is in this world
[38:22.500 --> 38:26.020]  Even if you work for God or work for the devil, you're still in God's plan. And so
[38:26.900 --> 38:28.500]  People make fun of Michael and Dell
[38:28.500 --> 38:34.180]  And so people make fun of Michael and Dell said we're going to prove election fraud. We're going to expose it
[38:34.180 --> 38:35.780]  We're going to reinstate Trump
[38:35.780 --> 38:40.660]  You have to have that belief because they did spill the election to have the confidence to ever have that happen
[38:40.660 --> 38:45.300]  That's why the justice department's now gotten involved telling 20-something states. You're not allowed to investigate elections
[38:45.700 --> 38:48.980]  But that's totally unconstitutional what they're saying because we know they stole it
[38:49.140 --> 38:54.500]  And they have this overwhelming and people are going to learn about hacking and they're going to learn about how they won't turn over the digital
[38:54.500 --> 38:58.980]  data in all these states because they were hacked into they weren't just stuffing ballots that night
[38:59.940 --> 39:02.100]  So Michael and Dell was having an event that I'm going to be at
[39:02.980 --> 39:04.980]  coming up on august
[39:06.420 --> 39:08.420]  10 11 and 12
[39:08.900 --> 39:11.380]  And it's going to be a cyber symposium for the media
[39:11.940 --> 39:15.940]  And all the independent media needs to be there and I can tell you Michael and Dell is putting all his money
[39:15.940 --> 39:20.740]  It's like I am into this fight and so he stopped advertising yesterday
[39:20.740 --> 39:26.740]  When Fox News because they would not even let him run an ad about his cyber security symposium
[39:27.140 --> 39:31.940]  They say that doesn't exist. There is no digital hacking even though we have hundreds of hours of literally
[39:32.420 --> 39:36.740]  of Democrats in hearings in the last decade including just two years ago in a year ago
[39:37.140 --> 39:43.700]  Right before the election saying don't trust machine hackers and get into them. It's all a fraud. We should de-certify all these machines suddenly
[39:43.700 --> 39:51.220]  Suddenly when they were able to fill the election via the machines, suddenly they absolutely love the machines and the judge department says
[39:51.460 --> 39:56.900]  It's an act of terrorism literally to even question the election. Well, you know what? It's an act of patriotism. It's my right and my duty
[39:56.900 --> 39:58.500]  so
[39:58.500 --> 40:02.340]  I've been on quasi vacation for a couple days ago talked to Mike talked to his crew
[40:02.820 --> 40:08.100]  And I already knew basically what was coming and I'm very very honored the fact that we're one of the main flagship groups
[40:08.500 --> 40:11.940]  He's promoting the symposium through and I can tell you Mike is getting the biggest response
[40:11.940 --> 40:14.900]  He's ever had with info wars because you listeners are awesome
[40:15.380 --> 40:21.140]  And you're doing really a great job. He's got a great lot of products, but he's offering the biggest promo code ever now
[40:22.580 --> 40:24.740]  Which is really the promo code we have with this promo code Alex
[40:24.740 --> 40:27.940]  That's the highest rate because a lot of other talk show hosts have partnerships
[40:27.940 --> 40:32.660]  But they want a little bit bigger percentage which I get so so that's still great deals, but they sell at you know
[40:33.780 --> 40:38.580]  Each talk show host kind of tailors their own deal pull for what percentage they want to get from the percentages there
[40:38.580 --> 40:41.620]  I said, I want whatever the best deal is for the customer. I don't people know
[40:41.620 --> 40:46.180]  I have the lowest prices on the pillows and on the towels and on the sheets and on the human beds the dog beds
[40:46.180 --> 40:48.500]  The cat beds and everything I said, I want
[40:49.140 --> 40:50.820]  Whatever the best deal is he said, okay
[40:50.820 --> 40:52.820]  That is the podcaster radio deal
[40:52.820 --> 40:57.300]  That is up to 66 off that is the best deal across the board promo code Alex
[40:58.340 --> 41:01.700]  As we predicted the globalists are now launching a new lockdown
[41:02.100 --> 41:07.220]  The first one has already destroyed the third world already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death
[41:07.220 --> 41:10.820]  And it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world
[41:11.540 --> 41:14.660]  Ladies and gentlemen now is the time for you to get high quality storeable food

[42:04.020 --> 42:06.260]  Training us that humans are dirty bad and evil
[42:06.980 --> 42:09.380]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of canada
[42:10.020 --> 42:14.900]  Says he admires the communist dictatorship of ggping and wishes to make canada's saying
[42:15.460 --> 42:19.700]  Has announced that they're buying vaccines for every person in the country

[42:25.460 --> 42:27.460]  And he says it'll be whatever
[42:27.460 --> 42:29.460]  Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body

[45:09.860 --> 45:29.220]  From the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[45:29.220 --> 45:36.900]  All right, folks. Oh, it's shroyer again doing a great job there in
[45:37.780 --> 45:39.780]  Austin, Texas. I am just via the phone
[45:40.660 --> 45:43.060]  Here trying to take some time off, but obviously that didn't happen
[45:43.540 --> 45:47.220]  We've actually got a lot done while I've been out of town. It helped me just reset my brain
[45:47.940 --> 45:53.140]  Let me just finish up what I was saying is I didn't hear the break music and just recap what I was getting into
[45:53.140 --> 46:05.060]  Michael indel is a man in the arena. Michael indel didn't back down everybody else deserted trump and deserted the electoral process and deserted america during globalist coup of
[46:05.700 --> 46:07.380]  november
[46:07.380 --> 46:09.380]  2020 and then what we saw thereafter
[46:10.740 --> 46:17.060]  And so they're never going to let us get out of this dictatorship. They're never going to stop the election fraud until we expose them and they are deadly afraid
[46:17.060 --> 46:20.820]  We're doing it. That's why biden again two months ago put out the june report
[46:20.820 --> 46:24.260]  On counterterrorism saying the new mission is white people
[46:25.220 --> 46:27.700]  People that question the election people that are against lockdowns
[46:28.580 --> 46:32.020]  I'm like, well, you know lockdown is already coming from the other documents, but there you go
[46:32.020 --> 46:35.220]  I mean, they are going to do this and then say we're terrorists. Well, good luck
[46:35.700 --> 46:39.700]  Let's just have the FBI start arresting people that are against lockdowns. See how that goes
[46:40.100 --> 46:43.220]  I mean, these tyrants are basically out of political capital
[46:43.620 --> 46:45.620]  People know who they are and they're scared, but
[46:45.620 --> 46:51.380]  Well, like when they don't having this conference save the world probably not but but will it put another dent in the enemy's armor?
[46:51.780 --> 46:54.420]  That's the frickin lute. So mike is incredibly
[46:55.060 --> 46:58.900]  Optimistic he sees a great guy. He works 20 hours a day all the time
[46:59.540 --> 47:07.060]  He's very optimistic. So the enemy attacks even says, oh, you know trouble be reinstated by august. Well, he's already reinstated the american people's mind
[47:07.300 --> 47:13.940]  80 plus percent of republicans know it was stolen now. It's at the 40 percent of democrats that scares the hell out of the system
[47:13.940 --> 47:15.940]  And every day
[47:16.500 --> 47:21.300]  That number grows that the average american believes the election was stolen. I know a bunch of former democrats
[47:21.620 --> 47:25.220]  They all now aren't republicans, but they don't like biden. No, he stole the election
[47:25.460 --> 47:28.660]  so so the mask is off right now and
[47:29.060 --> 47:37.380]  So right now ladies and gentlemen info wars gets a percentage of all of the sales that use the promo code at
[47:38.180 --> 47:40.180]  mypola.com
[47:40.180 --> 47:46.020]  Or frank speech calm and when you hear michael indell this one minute video at about the play
[47:46.820 --> 47:50.020]  On the radio, you'll hear it on tv. You'll see it say the best deal
[47:51.620 --> 47:53.300]  His speech site
[47:53.300 --> 47:59.300]  That's true frank speech com with the promo code alec that gets you the very best deal of the best deal
[47:59.620 --> 48:02.260]  Because that site is basically his podcaster deal
[48:02.500 --> 48:04.020]  Which is his best deal?
[48:04.020 --> 48:07.780]  And I think it's also a reflection of the fact that of all the deals he's got they're all excellent
[48:07.780 --> 48:10.900]  Again, he's got a lot of hundreds other talk show hosts that work with him
[48:11.460 --> 48:14.740]  Some people want a bigger percentage so they sell the stuff for a little bit more
[48:15.220 --> 48:18.900]  The talk show host gets a little bit better percentage for themselves. Again. I didn't do that
[48:19.300 --> 48:21.300]  I go with the very best deal across the board
[48:21.620 --> 48:26.900]  up to 66 off at frank speech com promo code alex or
[48:27.300 --> 48:32.020]  You can simply go to mypola.com and again use promo code alec. You get the exact same deal
[48:32.340 --> 48:34.340]  It is the very best deals you're going to get
[48:34.340 --> 48:38.340]  Uh, and again, I've been talking to mike quite a bit. He's going to be back on the show next week and maybe come down
[48:38.820 --> 48:40.500]  in studio with us
[48:40.500 --> 48:44.820]  He's a demonized guy everybody says don't work with because they're scared of i'm a demonized guy everybody says
[48:44.820 --> 48:50.900]  Don't work with because they're scared of me if we ever start coming together as patriots and mice expose the vaccines as well
[48:50.980 --> 48:55.140]  So-called vaccines. It's over for them. So I will be at the cybers symposium
[48:55.780 --> 48:59.060]  I will be there documenting his media. I suggest you go to it as well
[48:59.060 --> 49:04.580]  Frank speech comm follow all the details tell everyone you know about it and come to this event
[49:04.580 --> 49:05.620]  They're going to make fun of it
[49:05.620 --> 49:08.500]  They're going to demonize that they're going to attack it because they're scared of it
[49:08.500 --> 49:12.260]  They know their criminals have stole this election and we're going to continue to fight
[49:12.340 --> 49:16.740]  We've gotten laws passed in 18 states that to stop the fraud were passed from other states
[49:17.140 --> 49:21.860]  And and michael indell and info wars and all of you have been essential and president comes to a good job on that as well
[49:22.180 --> 49:25.700]  Send the election to fraud because it is a fraud even if you don't like trump
[49:25.700 --> 49:31.300]  You feel he's doing a good job exposing election fraud and it's critical that we do this together if he just rolled over
[49:31.540 --> 49:33.540]  They wouldn't try to indict him and his family
[49:33.540 --> 49:36.420]  But he's not rolling over and so they're trying to indict him so they're trying to indict me
[49:36.420 --> 49:42.500]  But that's okay. I'm in a war. I signed on for this. I'm right where I want to be so here is the one minute video

[51:39.540 --> 51:45.460]  Unless you use promo code alex at mypola.com because that is the best deal there is again. I've explained that
[51:45.780 --> 51:48.980]  That's why using alex you get the very best deal up to 66
[51:49.540 --> 51:53.540]  Uh percent off because that's just my gut level was to go with the biggest discounts of the listeners
[51:54.020 --> 51:56.340]  Uh, and even though we were bringing less money per order
[51:56.740 --> 51:59.460]  I believe that everybody would know it was the best deal and do that and we've done that
[51:59.700 --> 52:03.940]  And so it's taken us from the red into the black when we've been able to do a lot of stuff behind the scenes
[52:03.940 --> 52:09.620]  The fight to globalist and this is just one hell of a time to be alive. Listen. I got stacks of videos stacks of articles
[52:10.100 --> 52:17.140]  Stacks of things to cover. There's so much unfolding. The republicans are finally starting to find their guts. They're wave-os like Owen was saying earlier
[52:18.500 --> 52:23.220]  I've got a lot of stuff, you know, that I want to add as well. But uh, just you know, that adon salas our article
[52:23.780 --> 52:25.780]  Owen for me is just really the big deal that
[52:25.780 --> 52:32.580]  countries with 98 percent inoculation rate with this deadly thing and the others at 90 percent
[52:33.380 --> 52:34.740]  Singapore
[52:34.740 --> 52:36.580]  at almost 80 percent
[52:36.580 --> 52:41.460]  Always isolated 90 plus percent. They all have the highest outbreaks the highest death rates
[52:42.180 --> 52:48.340]  And they're of course dying from the inoculation. They're dying from the prions. They're dying from the crystals and and we know that that's the science
[52:48.740 --> 52:50.740]  Think of the boldness of this, Owen
[52:50.740 --> 52:56.900]  So we've got to get the fact out that no it is the countries that are almost completely quoted inoculated that are having the problems
[52:57.060 --> 53:01.380]  That destroys the lies and the lockdowns that are going back in place. Do you agree with me, Ellen?
[53:01.700 --> 53:02.900]  Well, and here's the thing Alex
[53:02.900 --> 53:08.260]  There's a reason why the chinese communist agents on cnn like dr. Lena when
[53:08.820 --> 53:12.340]  Or or people you hear on npr talk the way they talk
[53:12.420 --> 53:17.060]  They've been trained to be monotonous sound like an autonomous bot
[53:17.060 --> 53:21.300]  Annunciate every little syllable because that's part of the psychological operation
[53:21.380 --> 53:26.740]  So they don't like it when Alex Jones goes on air or Owen Schreuer goes on air or Harrison smith or any of our great
[53:26.740 --> 53:30.820]  Guests here and we're flailing around and throwing papers in the air like look at this
[53:30.980 --> 53:35.940]  Look at these numbers in Israel. Look at these numbers. Look at these numbers in iceland. Look at the veyres report
[53:35.940 --> 53:38.500]  They just deleted it off the website. Look at in Israel
[53:38.500 --> 53:43.860]  They just deleted all the numbers because it's like this is real information. We're not trained to propagandize you
[53:43.860 --> 53:48.980]  We just believe you're going to want to see this information and it may shock you it may change your life
[53:49.060 --> 53:50.740]  You may completely
[53:50.740 --> 53:54.740]  Just not even believe it at first, but then you realize wait a second. These guys weren't lying to me
[53:55.140 --> 53:57.140]  So it's it's overwhelming
[53:57.940 --> 53:59.940]  To sit here for a year and a half
[54:00.660 --> 54:05.940]  Be breaking this down a week ahead of the news cycle a month ahead of the news cycle a year ahead of the news cycle
[54:05.940 --> 54:09.860]  On every different angle simply because we've understood something that
[54:09.860 --> 54:15.460]  Republicans and other commentators are finally starting to understand and and the first response is always this
[54:15.940 --> 54:22.420]  This doesn't make sense. It doesn't make sense. They keep reversing the mass mandate. It doesn't make sense that the vaccinated are causing
[54:23.220 --> 54:27.700]  The new variants. It doesn't make sense that the nations that are the most vaccinated are having the outbreaks
[54:27.700 --> 54:28.900]  But wait a second
[54:28.900 --> 54:33.540]  It all makes sense as soon as you accept the fact that it was all by design
[54:33.860 --> 54:35.620]  It's all a plan to conquer the world
[54:35.620 --> 54:42.100]  I mean hell if Hitler had the technology or if Napoleon had the technology or Genghis Khan had the technology
[54:42.420 --> 54:46.580]  And the wherewithal to do all of this they would have conquered the world a long time ago
[54:47.060 --> 54:50.020]  You're right. Oh, and and let me say something. I hope you do this next hour and be listening
[54:50.420 --> 54:53.860]  You are so good at sports analogies because you know as a young man, you already got a you know
[54:53.860 --> 54:55.860]  We were in a popular sports show
[54:56.420 --> 54:57.780]  in Missouri
[54:57.780 --> 55:01.620]  Sports is archetypal balance. It's archetypal chess. You know football is basically
[55:02.740 --> 55:04.180]  You know chess
[55:04.180 --> 55:08.420]  And this is real people. That's why we love it because we understand that it's based on things that are real
[55:08.740 --> 55:10.740]  ancient combat ancient war
[55:10.900 --> 55:16.340]  And so whenever you're you know seeing the quarterback throw that pass but two seconds left from the clock and seven days over time
[55:16.660 --> 55:20.260]  You get high as a kite with adrenaline and and and and endorphins
[55:20.660 --> 55:25.220]  Because it's real. Well, we are watching millions of our people die millions starved to death
[55:25.300 --> 55:28.820]  We're watching global criminals lie to us. We're watching them lock us in our houses
[55:28.820 --> 55:34.420]  But mask on our kids faces. This isn't watching football folks where they get excited and oh my god, he's running for the
[55:34.500 --> 55:38.180]  He's at the 20. He's at the 10. He's in the goal post early. They won the Super Bowl
[55:38.580 --> 55:41.060]  Folks, I like watching tom brady last year as he was the underdog
[55:41.060 --> 55:44.660]  I like watching not wear a mask because they hated it that made it political
[55:44.660 --> 55:48.820]  So finally I started watching football again only because of tom brady because that a little bit of reality
[55:48.900 --> 55:50.660]  Hello, i'm mike lindell
[55:50.660 --> 55:54.500]  And i'm coming to you with the most important commercial that i've ever done

[56:47.780 --> 56:49.780]  Thanks
[56:51.700 --> 56:56.420]  The globalists are having their revolution but free humanity has to have its revolution
[56:57.220 --> 56:59.620]  We have to first recognize this anti-human
[57:00.580 --> 57:02.580]  takeovers trying to
[57:03.300 --> 57:06.340]  enslave the entire biological processes of humans
[57:07.300 --> 57:09.540]  And turn us into these artificial corporate
[57:10.580 --> 57:12.580]  controlled
[57:12.980 --> 57:14.580]  slaves
[57:14.580 --> 57:18.260]  Orson slaves and just just property from cradle to grave of the system
[57:19.300 --> 57:21.300]  rendered down to be servile
[57:22.020 --> 57:24.020]  minions of the system and a ritual of
[57:24.900 --> 57:26.900]  dominance and safety and control
[57:26.900 --> 57:30.020]  We have to recognize their great reset post-industrial world
[57:30.660 --> 57:33.620]  which realizes a nightmare dystopia and we have to promote liberty and freedom
[57:34.260 --> 57:36.260]  That is the opposite of their dystopia
[57:36.820 --> 57:39.940]  It's that choice. It's that realization that's going to change the world
[57:39.940 --> 57:44.580]  And it's the only choice. We've got freedom or slavery go to evil
[57:45.460 --> 57:48.580]  It is a spiritual battle and info wars at the tip of the spear fighting it
[57:52.500 --> 57:55.220]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[57:55.220 --> 58:11.780]  All right alex jones here in the final segment uh, and then i'm gonna turn it over the next two hours. I'll enjoy her
[58:11.780 --> 58:13.060]  I guess so
[58:13.060 --> 58:16.660]  Everything else coming up and then i'm gonna be doing fun reports this weekend and on sunday
[58:17.300 --> 58:18.900]  I'll be there live as well
[58:18.900 --> 58:20.900]  4 to 6 p.m. You better believe it, but
[58:20.900 --> 58:25.380]  Just finishing up. You see people get excited. They put on their jerseys. That's the tribal outfit
[58:26.100 --> 58:32.580]  Uh, you know their gang outfit they go to the game, you know, you you you you in camp outside the game like you're the camp followers
[58:32.980 --> 58:34.980]  following your armies
[58:34.980 --> 58:40.500]  Uh, and and then you watch your armies through battle and but but all of that is just because they understand psychology
[58:40.900 --> 58:42.900]  And they're siphoning off your energy
[58:42.980 --> 58:48.500]  That should be encamping at the city council and camping at the capital peacefully that should be encamping at your
[58:48.500 --> 58:53.540]  Schools, you know, that should be taking your culture back. The left is encamping everywhere
[58:53.940 --> 58:58.900]  They're physically dominating and they want our children and they're taking our children's minds and they're innocent
[58:58.980 --> 59:02.020]  So now they want to put things in our body. They're experimental
[59:02.660 --> 59:04.500]  They're gaslighting us
[59:04.500 --> 59:07.380]  And in most areas the world vaccination rates are at less than 10 percent
[59:08.020 --> 59:10.020]  And by the way, they have low quote covid numbers
[59:10.100 --> 59:12.980]  But the places with the highest inoculation can have the highest covid numbers
[59:13.620 --> 59:17.380]  And you now see that happen here because as bad as we are at 49 percent
[59:17.380 --> 59:24.260]  Uh, you know, the indians are like six seven percent look at places where they're subservient like singapore or gibraltar
[59:24.660 --> 59:29.700]  Or island where they're at 80 to 98 percent big on the country and that's just a smoking gun
[59:30.340 --> 59:31.780]  and so
[59:31.780 --> 59:35.380]  If you get the adan solos our article or write your own article or have other talk show hosts
[59:35.380 --> 59:39.940]  Other people put out articles about this smoking gun that wait a minute. You just said we all had the shot
[59:40.580 --> 59:43.220]  There wouldn't be any of this going on but everybody's sick taking the shot
[59:43.220 --> 59:46.980]  Then we can overturn all this. Remember they said oh the Pfizer and Moderna
[59:47.460 --> 59:49.460]  They're 92 percent of good
[59:49.460 --> 59:52.420]  But the jay and jays only 60 all of that's a lie
[59:53.060 --> 59:54.340]  All of it's full
[59:54.340 --> 59:58.820]  All of it's fraud. I know this is hardcore stuff. I'm very thankful to our affiliates to our listeners
[59:59.460 --> 1:00:01.620]  everybody, you know in this incredible time, but
[1:00:02.660 --> 1:00:04.660]  There's always been evil in the universe
[1:00:05.300 --> 1:00:08.820]  And it's making its move right now. We have to understand that good is more powerful
[1:00:08.820 --> 1:00:10.820]  But if we sit there on our hands
[1:00:10.900 --> 1:00:12.420]  if we do nothing
[1:00:12.420 --> 1:00:17.620]  Then we have no pants or no shot against these people, but you're doing a great job. I see it everywhere
[1:00:18.500 --> 1:00:25.940]  On tiktok on instagram on twitter everyone looking people send me every day videos with 100 000 views a million views 700 000 views
[1:00:26.580 --> 1:00:32.980]  And people are digging through the archives at chrisenplanted.tv. It's all free. It's all there and they're going back and finding
[1:00:33.860 --> 1:00:35.620]  where we told everybody
[1:00:35.620 --> 1:00:38.580]  Exactly what would happen and it's having a huge effect. That really is
[1:00:38.580 --> 1:00:42.260]  In full or superpower is that we have the globalist documents
[1:00:42.740 --> 1:00:48.180]  And we were right about all this and this is our time to stop them because people don't listen to you when you're right at the time
[1:00:48.180 --> 1:00:49.140]  They don't want to listen
[1:00:49.140 --> 1:00:53.060]  But they listen of what you said 20 years ago comes to pass exactly as you said so
[1:00:53.700 --> 1:00:57.780]  I saw paul watchen wrote an article about chris sky this morning. I played chris tyler in a week. I think he's a great guy
[1:00:58.340 --> 1:01:03.940]  Uh, you know and he made predictions off their own government documents that he got that we also covered months before
[1:01:03.940 --> 1:01:09.860]  Uh, and I'm glad that he said it so eloquently did a great job. But but I had the mad of the article my predictions
[1:01:10.260 --> 1:01:12.260]  Not so that I got credit
[1:01:12.420 --> 1:01:16.420]  But in my predictions, I explained where it came from in the rocket seller documents
[1:01:16.980 --> 1:01:21.860]  And so and chris does that as well. It's just a short clip of him getting passed around that has like 10 million views last time
[1:01:21.860 --> 1:01:23.860]  Just the last week
[1:01:23.860 --> 1:01:28.020]  That that that part doesn't have the the the the the putting in it
[1:01:28.020 --> 1:01:32.660]  So people need to go to band.video or to freeworldnews.tv
[1:01:32.660 --> 1:01:34.660]  Or to freeworldnews.tv
[1:01:34.820 --> 1:01:37.140]  But they need to go to the alex jones predictions page
[1:01:37.700 --> 1:01:40.420]  Uh, because that page is not really visited. It doesn't have a lot of views
[1:01:40.740 --> 1:01:43.060]  I mean some of them have maybe a quarter million a half million views
[1:01:43.300 --> 1:01:49.380]  Those need 10 million views or get those take clips out of them and pull them out because you don't know how powerful you are
[1:01:49.860 --> 1:01:53.300]  When you do that a video might get a hundred views. It might get 50 000 might get 10 million
[1:01:53.620 --> 1:01:55.460]  The point is is that
[1:01:55.460 --> 1:01:58.660]  This stuff is coffinels to the enemy. This stuff is like kryptonite to them
[1:01:58.660 --> 1:02:04.020]  And so i'm telling you listeners you are everything when you tell your neighbors about the radio station carries us
[1:02:04.340 --> 1:02:07.780]  When you share the live feed on your email your text message. That's what gets past the sensors
[1:02:08.180 --> 1:02:13.540]  When you say oh, look at this conspiracy theorist alex jones. What do you think they won't ban you then and link us on twitter
[1:02:14.180 --> 1:02:17.300]  For freeworldnews.tv the live view of the show it changes the world. So
[1:02:18.100 --> 1:02:20.100]  I I don't want a bunch of spectators
[1:02:20.660 --> 1:02:23.460]  I don't want to be the guy that has all the knowledge and then I control people with it
[1:02:23.460 --> 1:02:27.780]  I want everybody to get the knowledge so we can all be free together into the future the people perish
[1:02:27.780 --> 1:02:32.420]  For a lack of knowledge. All right. I'm gonna hand the baton over to own stories on a great job this week
[1:02:32.980 --> 1:02:37.620]  I just want to thank all the listeners for your prayers pray for global awakening pray for the innocent children being targeted
[1:02:38.100 --> 1:02:43.380]  And and pray for justice to the true god to be brought against the new world order. God bless. I want your take over
[1:02:45.140 --> 1:02:46.500]  Thank you alex
[1:02:46.500 --> 1:02:51.380]  All right, when we come back ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna get into a lot of video clips and some of the breaking news

[1:04:16.740 --> 1:04:24.980]  All right ladies and gentlemen
[1:04:27.140 --> 1:04:31.300]  Before I get into this news here on my desk and these video clips
[1:04:32.580 --> 1:04:34.580]  We've got ready for you today
[1:04:35.700 --> 1:04:37.700]  I want to explain something
[1:04:40.420 --> 1:04:45.380]  Most of this audience probably already understands but uh, we have new audience members
[1:04:45.380 --> 1:04:48.500]  Tuning in every day. I'm always
[1:04:49.700 --> 1:04:53.460]  I don't I don't know if I should say pleasantly surprised, but I'm surprised when
[1:04:54.900 --> 1:04:56.900]  I'll meet people
[1:04:56.980 --> 1:05:00.500]  Who will say hey, you know, I love your broadcast. I love what info wars is doing
[1:05:02.100 --> 1:05:04.660]  And you'll get to talking and I'll say hey, when did you first tune in?
[1:05:05.620 --> 1:05:12.900]  And so many people will say oh, I just tuned in in the year 2020 or I tuned in after they stole the election from trump
[1:05:12.900 --> 1:05:16.900]  And you guys were the only ones being honest or I tuned in when I saw the vaccine side effects
[1:05:16.900 --> 1:05:18.900]  And you guys are the only ones reporting on it and so
[1:05:20.820 --> 1:05:22.820]  It's important
[1:05:24.020 --> 1:05:28.900]  To kind of cover the basics here that are just logical common sense
[1:05:30.260 --> 1:05:32.260]  human reasoning things
[1:05:33.140 --> 1:05:37.380]  So that you can take that foundational knowledge or that foundational logic
[1:05:37.380 --> 1:05:42.580]  And then start to apply it to everything else that you see developing so that it does make sense
[1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:47.700]  And that's why it's so frustrating when I see who are good americans
[1:05:48.740 --> 1:05:50.740]  Who aren't out to get you
[1:05:50.900 --> 1:05:55.380]  But they've never really been hardcore and they've always wanted to stay on social media
[1:05:55.380 --> 1:06:00.020]  So they censor themselves and they want to make sure that they can do their hits on fox news
[1:06:00.020 --> 1:06:04.660]  So they won't say anything too controversial or they like being invited to the big events
[1:06:04.660 --> 1:06:10.580]  So they can take a picture with don jr or whoever else is there to put on their social media and feel popular
[1:06:12.500 --> 1:06:14.500]  But those individuals
[1:06:16.100 --> 1:06:18.100]  Are starting to
[1:06:18.260 --> 1:06:23.460]  Ask a question or they're starting to notice things and and I see the same
[1:06:24.980 --> 1:06:26.980]  Quote over and over again
[1:06:27.380 --> 1:06:30.340]  This doesn't make sense. This doesn't make sense
[1:06:30.340 --> 1:06:37.300]  Specifically when it comes to the vaccines when it comes to the masks when it comes to the lockdowns. This doesn't make sense
[1:06:40.100 --> 1:06:45.140]  And so that's spurring a new level of an awakening process in these individuals
[1:06:46.580 --> 1:06:49.940]  And they have to understand this this basic core knowledge
[1:06:50.980 --> 1:06:52.980]  In order for things to make sense
[1:06:54.260 --> 1:06:56.260]  It was never about a virus
[1:06:56.260 --> 1:07:02.740]  It was never about protecting people. It was always about power
[1:07:05.060 --> 1:07:08.260]  It was a global operation from day one
[1:07:09.620 --> 1:07:12.180]  Planned with events like crimson contagion
[1:07:12.820 --> 1:07:16.900]  Event 201 and many other quote unquote drills that they run
[1:07:19.460 --> 1:07:23.460]  So they could lock down humanity set that precedent of medical tyranny
[1:07:23.460 --> 1:07:25.460]  around the world
[1:07:26.500 --> 1:07:28.500]  And then build off of that
[1:07:30.660 --> 1:07:35.220]  A system of oppression in which the individual has no value no perceived worth
[1:07:36.180 --> 1:07:38.180]  and can be locked up
[1:07:38.340 --> 1:07:40.500]  and tied up and shackled
[1:07:41.380 --> 1:07:45.460]  Or killed at any given time because that individual has no value
[1:07:46.180 --> 1:07:51.060]  In fact, that individual is actually a bad thing a negative. You're a virus spreader. You're a
[1:07:51.060 --> 1:07:53.060]  climate change
[1:07:56.980 --> 1:08:00.420]  Person who drives a car or whatever, you know how they say it so
[1:08:02.820 --> 1:08:08.260]  When all these people are looking at the mass mandates and the vaccines and the lockdown saying this doesn't make sense
[1:08:09.140 --> 1:08:14.180]  No, it does make sense. It's all part of an agenda. It's all part of a plan
[1:08:15.700 --> 1:08:18.020]  And the end game is total
[1:08:18.020 --> 1:08:22.020]  Global medical tyranny one world government
[1:08:23.220 --> 1:08:28.180]  And it's not even communist. It's it's it's beyond communist. It's it's slavery is what it is
[1:08:28.980 --> 1:08:32.660]  Communism would almost be a good thing compared to what it is. They're rolling out for us
[1:08:33.220 --> 1:08:35.860]  It's total slavery. It's the end of the individual
[1:08:37.540 --> 1:08:39.540]  And it's getting to a point
[1:08:40.580 --> 1:08:42.580]  Where a global government
[1:08:43.540 --> 1:08:45.540]  Can force inoculate you
[1:08:45.540 --> 1:08:52.100]  Which could mean anything could kill you if they wanted to and you know how you have no means of recusal
[1:08:52.100 --> 1:08:56.020]  You have no means of fighting back and you're actually bad if you think you do
[1:08:56.260 --> 1:08:58.580]  You're bad if you think you have any individual rights
[1:08:59.140 --> 1:09:03.780]  And this all seems extreme and it all seems impossible right now. That's where it's going
[1:09:04.900 --> 1:09:07.540]  And so once you have that basic understanding
[1:09:08.580 --> 1:09:10.980]  That this is a global population control
[1:09:11.620 --> 1:09:14.100]  Worldwide government medical tyranny operation
[1:09:14.100 --> 1:09:20.900]  You no longer say hey, this doesn't make sense. They're waking we wear a mask. Hey, this doesn't make sense. They're making me lock down again
[1:09:20.900 --> 1:09:23.700]  Hey, this doesn't make sense the vaccinated are causing the spread. No
[1:09:24.420 --> 1:09:25.460]  It all makes sense
[1:09:25.460 --> 1:09:30.100]  It has nothing to do with the virus and it has everything to do with building a one world government
[1:09:30.660 --> 1:09:33.700]  In which you the individual has no rights no freedoms
[1:09:34.660 --> 1:09:39.140]  And the government can come to your door and murder you if they see fit
[1:09:39.140 --> 1:09:44.580]  Locking you up is one thing. They'd rather not even deal with that. They'd rather just come to your door. Hey, you ready for your vaccine?
[1:09:44.580 --> 1:09:49.140]  Sure, and then they inject you you fold better than a hammer. They scrape you out in a body bag
[1:09:50.900 --> 1:09:53.060]  Once you understand that it all makes sense
[1:09:54.660 --> 1:09:56.660]  Now here's three issues
[1:09:58.100 --> 1:10:00.420]  That if you understand the dichotomy of this
[1:10:02.500 --> 1:10:04.500]  Or you can see the
[1:10:05.860 --> 1:10:07.860]  Double standard or lies that
[1:10:07.860 --> 1:10:13.460]  Standard or lies behind these dichotomies then you understand how evil it is in its execution
[1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:16.980]  Then you can use these as examples to push back
[1:10:17.780 --> 1:10:19.780]  and get other humans to
[1:10:20.180 --> 1:10:22.340]  Awaken to this tyranny that is encroaching so
[1:10:24.420 --> 1:10:27.460]  How about the southern border versus
[1:10:29.140 --> 1:10:34.260]  The spread of the new variants or the spread of covet or whatever it doesn't matter that they can't isolate the delta variant
[1:10:34.260 --> 1:10:39.780]  It doesn't matter that they admitted that the PCR test can't tell the difference between covet or delta or the flu
[1:10:41.460 --> 1:10:43.460]  No, none of that matter see
[1:10:44.580 --> 1:10:48.980]  But the dichotomy that doesn't make sense until you understand there's an agenda afoot is
[1:10:49.540 --> 1:10:52.420]  How can they be telling us to be afraid of a spread?
[1:10:52.900 --> 1:10:57.940]  How can they be telling us we need to lock down? We need to wear masks. We need to do all this stuff because of a spread
[1:10:58.500 --> 1:11:00.500]  Meanwhile, the southern border is wide open
[1:11:00.500 --> 1:11:06.020]  Tens of thousands pouring over it every day. They don't wear masks. Many of them refuse vaccines
[1:11:07.540 --> 1:11:09.540]  How can they get away with that?
[1:11:10.260 --> 1:11:12.260]  Again, that doesn't make sense
[1:11:12.420 --> 1:11:16.740]  But it does make sense when you understand it was never meant to make sense. It's all part of an agenda
[1:11:17.700 --> 1:11:23.620]  And in in in that smaller scope smaller scale to destroy the united states of america
[1:11:24.500 --> 1:11:25.060]  So you're right
[1:11:25.060 --> 1:11:30.100]  It doesn't make sense that we have to lock down and wear masks and live in fear of covet while the southern border is wide open
[1:11:30.500 --> 1:11:35.860]  But when you realize that the agenda is to enslave the american people and end the american country
[1:11:36.260 --> 1:11:42.900]  As a sovereign nation. Oh, then it makes sense. Yeah, have people pour over the southern border while we lock down americans
[1:11:44.500 --> 1:11:48.180]  And anybody who doesn't see the double standard there is just a liar
[1:11:49.300 --> 1:11:51.940]  Or climate change man-made climate change
[1:11:51.940 --> 1:11:57.140]  They want to harass you over man-made climate change. They want to tell you you have to change your way of life
[1:11:57.220 --> 1:12:01.620]  You have to pay a carbon tax. You can't drive a car. You can't have a fireplace. You can't have ac
[1:12:01.700 --> 1:12:04.900]  You can't have heating because of man-made climate change, but then
[1:12:05.940 --> 1:12:07.940]  You sit here and you watch
[1:12:08.340 --> 1:12:13.940]  The government in dubai the government in russia the government in china the governments all around the world
[1:12:15.780 --> 1:12:19.220]  Bragging about how they have weather machines
[1:12:19.220 --> 1:12:24.660]  And how they use weather machines and have for decades. So but wait a second
[1:12:25.460 --> 1:12:27.460]  You the individual is bad
[1:12:27.620 --> 1:12:32.580]  Because of carbon emissions, but governments are literally working with weather machines to change the weather
[1:12:33.460 --> 1:12:38.420]  And they never talk about china who puts out more carbon emissions than every other industrialized country on earth combined
[1:12:39.060 --> 1:12:44.580]  Well, that doesn't make sense. No, it does make sense. It's all about control of the population
[1:12:44.580 --> 1:12:48.340]  And then there's the old pollution argument
[1:12:49.060 --> 1:12:54.740]  Hey, I think everybody's against pollution. Does anybody like pollution? I don't think anybody likes pollution
[1:12:57.460 --> 1:13:01.540]  But they use that as part of the climate change narrative because humans pollute
[1:13:02.660 --> 1:13:06.740]  And they do there's no denying it. I think it makes most people sick. I don't like seeing pollution
[1:13:08.500 --> 1:13:10.500]  But a new story came out today
[1:13:10.500 --> 1:13:15.060]  Over one and a half billion masks
[1:13:16.740 --> 1:13:20.900]  Are in the oceans in the rivers in the lakes in the seas
[1:13:22.340 --> 1:13:25.380]  Have just been polluted all across the world these masks
[1:13:26.180 --> 1:13:33.460]  But yet here they are again bringing back the mask mandate two masks three masks mass mass producing masks and they're everywhere
[1:13:33.460 --> 1:13:39.620]  It's now the number one pollutant in the world is masks and according to a study that just came out
[1:13:40.500 --> 1:13:44.420]  Takes hundreds of years for these masks to bio disintegrate
[1:13:45.700 --> 1:13:50.260]  So you see when you when you look at these issues and you see the double standard and you see the hypocrisy
[1:13:50.740 --> 1:13:53.060]  It helps you understand that all of it's a lie
[1:13:53.780 --> 1:13:55.940]  All of their leftist agendas are all just a lie
[1:13:56.820 --> 1:14:02.420]  Hello, i'm mike lindell and i'm coming to you with the most important commercial that i've ever done

[1:14:55.780 --> 1:15:03.700]  The scientific dictatorship that i've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational
[1:15:04.180 --> 1:15:09.540]  The globalists are out in the open with their planetary depopulation takeover their robot takeover
[1:15:09.700 --> 1:15:14.980]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades
[1:15:15.140 --> 1:15:18.740]  To get ready for this to be able to find it off humanity is strong
[1:15:19.060 --> 1:15:21.860]  We're incredible and if we're aware of the attack that's happening
[1:15:21.860 --> 1:15:26.020]  We have a real chance of defeating it if we ask god for guidance we will defeat it
[1:15:26.180 --> 1:15:32.260]  So prayer is essential research is essential getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential
[1:15:32.500 --> 1:15:39.940]  And at the same time supporting info wars by buying high-quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family

[1:15:57.940 --> 1:16:01.220]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology
[1:16:01.940 --> 1:16:03.940]  The criminologists all agree on
[1:16:04.740 --> 1:16:07.700]  And that its criminals aren't extremely pathological
[1:16:08.260 --> 1:16:11.700]  Even more the general public they do the same things over and over again
[1:16:11.780 --> 1:16:16.340]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again
[1:16:17.380 --> 1:16:18.980]  Well, guess what it was
[1:16:18.980 --> 1:16:22.340]  Anthony Fauci and eugenicist globalist that
[1:16:23.380 --> 1:16:29.140]  Ran the rollout of hiv and the mistreatment of it with azt and other chemicals that actually killed more people
[1:16:29.380 --> 1:16:32.340]  That hiv and they were the ones involved in viral research
[1:16:33.460 --> 1:16:36.820]  Of viruses that would actually go attack the t-limbs besides the body and create
[1:16:37.300 --> 1:16:38.980]  autoimmune disorders
[1:16:38.980 --> 1:16:44.900]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road
[1:16:44.900 --> 1:16:51.700]  That's why they need to roll out the covet 19 and the vaccine because now they admit the covet 19 vaccine destroys your immune system
[1:16:52.020 --> 1:16:55.780]  Basically giving you the equivalent of hiv. That's right ladies and gentlemen
[1:16:55.780 --> 1:17:11.380]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:17:19.300 --> 1:17:21.300]  Something is lifting the veil
[1:17:21.300 --> 1:17:24.020]  On humanity right now
[1:17:26.020 --> 1:17:31.220]  And it's all the lies of the mainstream media it's all the lies of our politicians. It's just living your life
[1:17:32.420 --> 1:17:36.260]  Trying to see reality for what it is and then seeing that reality
[1:17:38.420 --> 1:17:42.900]  Be debated on television and in the halls of congress and so
[1:17:43.940 --> 1:17:45.940]  There's these graphics going around
[1:17:45.940 --> 1:17:51.540]  That just illustrate the nonsense of it all like for example this one right here. That's going viral on twitter
[1:17:51.940 --> 1:17:57.940]  If the masks work, why the six feet if the six feet works, why the masks if they both work?
[1:17:57.940 --> 1:18:01.540]  Why the lockdowns if all three work? Why do we rush the vaccines?
[1:18:03.060 --> 1:18:05.060]  If the vaccines are safe
[1:18:05.060 --> 1:18:07.060]  Why the no liability clause
[1:18:07.060 --> 1:18:11.300]  If more people die from the vaccines than the virus, why use the vaccines?
[1:18:11.300 --> 1:18:16.020]  If we took two vaccines to keep others safe, why are the vaccinated now super spreaders?
[1:18:16.580 --> 1:18:20.820]  And if the vaccines work, why do they have why do vaccinated people have to wear masks again?
[1:18:20.820 --> 1:18:22.820]  So this is just one example of
[1:18:22.820 --> 1:18:30.100]  These graphics these charts that are going around just asking basic asking basic common sense questions that of course make no sense because
[1:18:31.540 --> 1:18:35.540]  That is under the illusion that this was ever about a virus
[1:18:35.540 --> 1:18:41.940]  That is under the delusion that our health care
[1:18:45.540 --> 1:18:53.540]  Alphabet bureaucracies ever cared about us or that your local democrat politician ever cared about you and they told you to wear a mask or take a vax
[1:18:53.540 --> 1:18:55.540]  No
[1:18:55.540 --> 1:19:02.540]  As soon as you realize this is all about controlling and enslaving you and giving a one world government medical tyranny the right to
[1:19:02.540 --> 1:19:04.540]  Euthanize you whenever they see fit
[1:19:05.660 --> 1:19:11.980]  Then all of this makes sense. But until you accept that reality none of it will make sense
[1:19:14.220 --> 1:19:16.380]  But people are starting to get it
[1:19:18.540 --> 1:19:22.540]  And you know in a way they're look they're not going to stop this
[1:19:23.100 --> 1:19:29.660]  Okay, they're not going to stop telling you to get 10 vaccines and wear 30 masks and you know, whatever else they come up with next
[1:19:29.660 --> 1:19:35.260]  And for example, like Fox News this morning has this graphic where they just get the numbers out of dc
[1:19:36.860 --> 1:19:41.820]  There have been four covid deaths in the last two weeks in Washington DC four
[1:19:42.380 --> 1:19:47.180]  Four covid deaths and you know that those are probably people that had co morbidities meaning they had
[1:19:47.660 --> 1:19:53.580]  You know morbid obesity or some other issue or we're 90 years old and there's been 11 homicides
[1:19:54.380 --> 1:19:56.380]  11 homicides
[1:19:56.380 --> 1:20:01.740]  11 homicides and so people see that and they're just stunned
[1:20:02.780 --> 1:20:07.820]  Because it was never about a virus ladies and gentlemen. It's always been about controlling you
[1:20:09.820 --> 1:20:13.260]  And even though there's a great awakening and a mass awakening happening to all of this
[1:20:13.820 --> 1:20:19.580]  Even from people who went with the establishment lies and believed the establishment cared and took the vaccine and everything
[1:20:19.580 --> 1:20:21.580]  They're having the greatest awakening of all right now
[1:20:21.900 --> 1:20:24.540]  Because they were the ones that got duped. They were the ones that got fooled
[1:20:24.540 --> 1:20:28.780]  They were the ones that thought hey if I wear the masks and I locked down and I take my vaccine
[1:20:28.780 --> 1:20:31.660]  We can get back to normal now. They're told nope. You got to wear the mask
[1:20:31.660 --> 1:20:36.140]  You got to lock down and it's actually your fault because you took a vaccine. You're now a super spreader
[1:20:40.460 --> 1:20:46.140]  But it but they everybody has to make that final leap of reality
[1:20:47.900 --> 1:20:50.860]  Which is that anybody who's gonna lie to you
[1:20:50.860 --> 1:20:57.180]  Consistently like Anthony Fauci hates you so Anthony Fauci hates you
[1:20:59.260 --> 1:21:05.260]  Any politician telling you you need to wear a mask or suggesting that we force vaccines hates you
[1:21:06.780 --> 1:21:11.340]  They hate you because you desire to be free. They hate you because you have a will to prosper
[1:21:12.060 --> 1:21:14.060]  And they want to stop that
[1:21:15.020 --> 1:21:17.020]  They want you to be enslaved
[1:21:17.020 --> 1:21:22.380]  They want you to be impoverished and they've even said by 2030
[1:21:22.460 --> 1:21:26.460]  They want everybody living in a pod eating bugs with no private property
[1:21:28.140 --> 1:21:30.620]  And you're already in 1984
[1:21:33.340 --> 1:21:37.340]  With this imperial probe droid here called a cellular phone
[1:21:38.540 --> 1:21:41.900]  That spies on you 24 7 and it's even worse now because
[1:21:41.900 --> 1:21:49.260]  It's reaching a point and we're learning this the hard way that hey, even if you do try to have some sort of group like a
[1:21:49.660 --> 1:21:51.900]  Like some sort of fraternity or something like that
[1:21:52.700 --> 1:21:54.700]  And you can say all right guys
[1:21:55.260 --> 1:22:00.780]  You know no cell phones here. We don't want the federal government spying on us. We just believe in freedom. Doesn't mean you're doing anything illegal or
[1:22:01.500 --> 1:22:05.980]  Irresponsible or inappropriate just means hey, we're just we're we got our little group here
[1:22:06.220 --> 1:22:08.780]  We don't want you know government agents spying on us
[1:22:08.780 --> 1:22:14.220]  So we're going to put our cell phones at the door and we're going to go inside here to this pool hall or whatever and
[1:22:14.460 --> 1:22:20.060]  Have some beverages and play some pool or play some poker and we're just going to have a night without government spies
[1:22:20.060 --> 1:22:23.820]  But oh see now the federal government sends the spies into your group
[1:22:25.180 --> 1:22:29.180]  And tries to instigate you to do things that are illegal like they did in michigan
[1:22:30.220 --> 1:22:35.420]  And like they certainly didn't wash in dc. So here is matt gates in clip 14
[1:22:35.420 --> 1:22:39.260]  Who's getting more hardcore as the days go by thank god
[1:22:39.820 --> 1:22:45.900]  Talking about what happened in michigan and how the exact same thing is likely what happened on january 6th
[1:22:47.500 --> 1:22:53.020]  We did what members of congress normally do we showed up at the facility and sought a tour
[1:22:53.420 --> 1:22:56.940]  This happens for republicans under democrat administrations
[1:22:57.100 --> 1:23:02.860]  It happened for democrats under republican administrations and now there is an unprecedented effort
[1:23:02.860 --> 1:23:07.900]  To deny members of congress information that relates to criminal cases
[1:23:08.300 --> 1:23:11.020]  And that relates to the treatment of people that are held
[1:23:11.580 --> 1:23:14.220]  We are not members of congress who will go away
[1:23:14.540 --> 1:23:18.300]  And so if you are out in the country and you believe that you are mistreated
[1:23:18.940 --> 1:23:20.940]  targeted abused
[1:23:21.020 --> 1:23:28.220]  Singled out as a consequence of your politics and your lawful activity know this we will continue to fight for you
[1:23:28.220 --> 1:23:32.620]  I now hand the microphone over to my colleague congressman good
[1:23:33.180 --> 1:23:40.540]  So thank god there's republican congressmen and women fighting against this crooked rotten communist democrat party
[1:23:41.660 --> 1:23:46.860]  Who has political prisoners being tortured in jail right now and and in that speech gates did mission
[1:23:48.060 --> 1:23:52.060]  Mentioned the fbi setting up the man and mission we did what members of congress
[1:23:52.060 --> 1:23:54.060]  And
[1:23:56.540 --> 1:23:57.740]  So
[1:23:57.740 --> 1:24:04.220]  They get caught red-handed in michigan and it's barely even a news story because the mainstream news is also infiltrated by feds
[1:24:05.580 --> 1:24:07.580]  It's called project mockingbird
[1:24:08.300 --> 1:24:11.340]  And we learned even more about that when donald trump
[1:24:11.980 --> 1:24:16.060]  As the 45th president of the united states declassified the jfk papers
[1:24:16.700 --> 1:24:19.180]  And we found out that the cia and the fbi
[1:24:19.180 --> 1:24:27.100]  Has men and women inside of newsrooms on television behind the scenes producing editing everything
[1:24:28.220 --> 1:24:30.220]  And they ran an operation
[1:24:31.100 --> 1:24:33.100]  After jfk was assassinated
[1:24:34.380 --> 1:24:36.380]  To cover it up
[1:24:36.380 --> 1:24:41.660]  And blame the lone gunman even though according to their own documents. They believe that there were multiple shooters
[1:24:42.460 --> 1:24:45.980]  So their fbi cia documents all declassified under donald trump
[1:24:45.980 --> 1:24:50.620]  And you'll notice that the mainstream news barely even covered it. Why because they're feds
[1:24:52.220 --> 1:24:58.780]  Because they're chinese communist agents because their cia fbi operation mockingbird agents
[1:24:59.660 --> 1:25:01.660]  It all came out in the frank church hearings
[1:25:03.260 --> 1:25:06.140]  And so that's the problem is we just sit here
[1:25:06.700 --> 1:25:12.780]  And we deal with the same corruption because we never root it out and it's like cancer metastasizing
[1:25:13.580 --> 1:25:15.580]  And it only gets worse
[1:25:15.580 --> 1:25:17.580]  The news has always been corrupt
[1:25:17.820 --> 1:25:19.820]  politicians have always been corrupt
[1:25:19.980 --> 1:25:22.620]  But we the people have never taken a stand
[1:25:23.980 --> 1:25:28.620]  To actually rid our institutions of all these corrupt individuals
[1:25:30.700 --> 1:25:35.820]  And maybe now that the world is waking up how bad it is maybe now that americans are waking up how bad it is
[1:25:35.820 --> 1:25:38.220]  Maybe now that republicans are waking up how bad it is
[1:25:39.100 --> 1:25:41.740]  I've got a statement from ted Cruz when we come back from this break
[1:25:42.380 --> 1:25:44.380]  Remember what donald trump said
[1:25:44.380 --> 1:25:51.580]  I knew it was bad, but I had no idea it was this bad. Yeah, we're talking about murderous psychotic liars
[1:25:51.900 --> 1:25:55.980]  That are in every institution of our government wielding their power against us
[1:25:56.940 --> 1:26:02.060]  The biosecurity state is here. It's an anti-human eugenics operation
[1:26:02.700 --> 1:26:04.940]  Training us that humans are dirty bad and evil
[1:26:05.740 --> 1:26:08.060]  The corrupt puppet prime minister of canada
[1:26:08.700 --> 1:26:13.580]  Who says he admires the communist dictatorship of gcp and wishes to make canada the same
[1:26:13.580 --> 1:26:15.580]  Has announced that they're buying
[1:26:16.300 --> 1:26:18.300]  Vaccines for every person in the country
[1:26:18.940 --> 1:26:20.940]  All the way out to 2024
[1:26:20.940 --> 1:26:25.180]  And then in 2024 you will again take two shots and he says it'll be whatever
[1:26:25.740 --> 1:26:29.740]  Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body. This is the rocker feller foundation
[1:26:29.980 --> 1:26:32.140]  They developed this whole plan with bill gates
[1:26:32.620 --> 1:26:37.500]  They're now implementing it and now they've announced that u.s policy is set by the private rocker feller foundation
[1:26:37.740 --> 1:26:41.420]  Of course the rocker feller foundation by the 30s was the main funder of adolf
[1:26:41.420 --> 1:26:47.180]  a lowest hitler and the eugenics at cold springs harbour that trained the coser film institute in germany
[1:26:47.660 --> 1:26:50.620]  And volwars will continue to step fast. They fight this. I don't know how long we can
[1:26:51.100 --> 1:26:55.820]  The enemy's coming for us all now. God bless and good luck. I would again get right with god right now
[1:26:56.540 --> 1:27:00.140]  I'm up here working on a thursday night in mid april 2021

[1:28:56.140 --> 1:29:01.660]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:29:13.900 --> 1:29:18.620]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, this is just incredible alex jones about to rejoin us here from the road, but
[1:29:19.420 --> 1:29:21.900]  CNN of all people has just
[1:29:21.900 --> 1:29:25.340]  Vindicated info wars
[1:29:26.300 --> 1:29:29.020]  Vaccination alone, this is from CNN mind you
[1:29:29.980 --> 1:29:37.660]  Vaccination alone won't stop the rise of variants and in fact could push the evolution of new strains
[1:29:41.980 --> 1:29:45.020]  These bastards man, they knew it all along man
[1:29:46.140 --> 1:29:51.420]  And uh the story that just went up vaccination is not enough by itself to stop the spread of the variants study finds
[1:29:51.420 --> 1:29:53.420]  And then it gets into this whole thing
[1:29:53.580 --> 1:29:55.580]  So so here's what they're doing now
[1:29:57.020 --> 1:30:00.700]  They they've now decided they can't put the the genie back in the bottle
[1:30:01.180 --> 1:30:06.140]  That the vaccinated people are causing the mutations and the vaccinated people are the super spreaders
[1:30:06.380 --> 1:30:10.060]  So what are they doing now? Well now they're just using that as more fear mongering
[1:30:10.940 --> 1:30:15.180]  Now they're just using it as more fear mongering. So so without actually admitting
[1:30:15.740 --> 1:30:17.740]  That the vaccines are causing this
[1:30:17.740 --> 1:30:24.700]  They just they just kind of nuance subliminally admit that the vaccinated people are causing the mutations and the spread
[1:30:25.020 --> 1:30:30.140]  But then they just use that as more fear mongering and hope that you don't realize they just admitted everything
[1:30:30.380 --> 1:30:34.780]  So so oh we're admitting the vaccinated people are causing the mutations in the spread
[1:30:34.780 --> 1:30:38.300]  But no that just means you need to be in fear don't don't look at the fact
[1:30:38.300 --> 1:30:41.740]  We pushed the vaccines and they're still not FDA approved and we lied about everything
[1:30:41.820 --> 1:30:44.860]  No, no ignore that and just get just be afraid again
[1:30:44.860 --> 1:30:51.740]  Uh and again, we had doctors on this broadcast on our on our morning show on the drive time show
[1:30:52.060 --> 1:30:56.060]  Afternoon drive that I host and with that all the doctors said the same thing Alex. This is not even
[1:30:56.860 --> 1:31:01.020]  I mean this is basic science. I never took a medical course and I understand this
[1:31:01.260 --> 1:31:08.540]  But the fact that they're now admitting this Alex and using it as fear mongering. I mean look they're in desperate times Alex
[1:31:08.540 --> 1:31:13.180]  I mean you they're going for everything and we know it and these people are more dangerous than ever
[1:31:13.180 --> 1:31:18.540]  But their desperation shows. Okay, we're going to be joined by Alex here momentarily
[1:31:19.260 --> 1:31:21.260]  again, though
[1:31:21.260 --> 1:31:22.540]  Folks
[1:31:22.540 --> 1:31:25.660]  I can't even I'm so overwhelmed. Let me just go through this news
[1:31:26.780 --> 1:31:28.940]  As we're going to be joined by Alex Jones here momentarily
[1:31:29.500 --> 1:31:35.340]  Biden orders federal workers including military to vaccinate or face regular coronavirus tests now again
[1:31:35.340 --> 1:31:42.380]  Every every one of these headlines that I'm covering right now needs the backdrop of the admission that they just made on cnn
[1:31:43.980 --> 1:31:51.580]  So even though the vaccinated people are causing the super spread and the vaccinated people are causing more dangerous mutations
[1:31:51.980 --> 1:31:56.780]  Biden wants to force you to get a vaccine. That's that's that's mandated death from that
[1:31:57.580 --> 1:32:02.060]  decrepit old husk that rotting old husk that bastard
[1:32:02.060 --> 1:32:05.100]  Belongs in jail yesterday
[1:32:05.980 --> 1:32:11.820]  U.S. Surgeon general recommends fully vaccinated people wear masks outdoors to protect the unvaccinated
[1:32:12.460 --> 1:32:14.460]  They're admitting everything
[1:32:15.020 --> 1:32:17.020]  They're admitting everything
[1:32:17.340 --> 1:32:19.340]  To protect the unvaccinated
[1:32:20.780 --> 1:32:28.300]  Folks they're admitting it the vaccinated people are killing people the vaccinated people are causing the spread the vaccinated people are causing the mutations
[1:32:28.620 --> 1:32:30.620]  They're admitting the whole thing
[1:32:30.620 --> 1:32:32.620]  Uh, this should be game
[1:32:32.780 --> 1:32:40.380]  Over man. This should be game over. We shouldn't be playing ball with these people anymore. They all need to be arrested
[1:32:41.500 --> 1:32:44.220]  They all need to be in jail rotting away
[1:32:44.620 --> 1:32:49.100]  Not the people that were in dc on january 6th fouchy needs to be in jail rotting away
[1:32:49.500 --> 1:32:54.620]  Biden needs to be in jail rotting away all these bastards in our government that force this
[1:32:54.620 --> 1:33:00.300]  Experimental vaccine on us that's now killing people and we haven't even begun to see the tip of this iceberg
[1:33:01.100 --> 1:33:03.100]  They all belong in jail rotting
[1:33:03.740 --> 1:33:05.740]  But now they just admit it
[1:33:06.220 --> 1:33:11.020]  See now they just come out and they just admit it. Oh, yeah, the vaccinated caused the deadly mutations
[1:33:11.420 --> 1:33:13.820]  Oh, yeah, the vaccinated people are causing the spread
[1:33:13.820 --> 1:33:19.980]  So vaccinated people you need to wear the mask or you're going to cause a super spreader event. You're going to kill more people
[1:33:20.700 --> 1:33:22.220]  unbelievable
[1:33:22.220 --> 1:33:25.020]  Unbelievable. Hey, this is an info wars telling you this
[1:33:26.940 --> 1:33:31.020]  This is now cnn. This is now the biden white house
[1:33:32.140 --> 1:33:36.620]  But see it doesn't matter. Oh, they just admit it, but the the covet tyranny doesn't go away
[1:33:37.900 --> 1:33:45.420]  Broad broadway theaters to require proof of covet 19 vaccination for guests and you must wear a mask when attending a broadway play
[1:33:47.020 --> 1:33:50.620]  Oh, but they'll be spitting all over the place all the vaccinated broadway actors
[1:33:50.620 --> 1:33:54.780]  Telling you how bad you are probably, you know telling you how racist you are. That's broadway now
[1:33:55.580 --> 1:33:57.900]  And and oh the vaccine is so good
[1:33:59.340 --> 1:34:03.580]  Because you're so afraid of a virus the biden administration is now proposing
[1:34:05.180 --> 1:34:11.820]  $100 cash incentive for you to get a vaccine. So remember they tried the vaccine lottery
[1:34:11.820 --> 1:34:17.180]  They couldn't get the numbers to go up. So now they're just giving you a direct payout a hundred bucks and you know, it's funny
[1:34:17.180 --> 1:34:21.900]  The people that have been vaccinated are actually the most pissed about this. They're like, well, where's my money?
[1:34:22.540 --> 1:34:28.380]  I signed up. I got vaccinated. I passed out. I was in bed for a week. I almost died after getting the vaccine. Where's my 100 bucks?
[1:34:29.500 --> 1:34:31.500]  pathetic
[1:34:31.500 --> 1:34:33.100]  and of course you have
[1:34:33.100 --> 1:34:34.700]  other
[1:34:34.700 --> 1:34:36.620]  companies
[1:34:36.620 --> 1:34:42.540]  Like restaurants and and walmart and other places saying they'll pay their employees to get vaccinated. I mean again
[1:34:42.540 --> 1:34:46.380]  You know, what is your what are your what do your parents tell you?
[1:34:46.940 --> 1:34:50.140]  Someone comes up in a van and says I've got ice cream in the truck
[1:34:50.780 --> 1:34:52.780]  You don't get in the truck
[1:34:53.580 --> 1:34:57.660]  You know some stranger comes up to you says hey, johnny. You want a lollipop?
[1:34:58.380 --> 1:35:00.380]  Hey little susie
[1:35:00.700 --> 1:35:04.220]  Hey, you know just getting my car. Hey, I've got money for you. Yeah
[1:35:04.220 --> 1:35:12.140]  I mean, that's basic instincts. You don't get into the you don't get into the man in the truck to get a free ice cream cone
[1:35:13.340 --> 1:35:20.700]  But that's the globalist. That's bill gates. That's anthony fouchy. Hey little buddy. I've got a vaccine for you
[1:35:22.140 --> 1:35:24.700]  Here's a hundred dollars take my vaccine
[1:35:25.420 --> 1:35:27.660]  It's like pennywise the clown in the in the sewer
[1:35:28.140 --> 1:35:32.620]  We've got hot dogs and popcorn. Can't you hear the circus?
[1:35:32.620 --> 1:35:35.660]  Can't you hear the circus little georgey?
[1:35:37.500 --> 1:35:44.380]  Little georgey sees the the demon and he sees the fangs and he sees the the clown makeup and his instinct is this is
[1:35:44.380 --> 1:35:48.540]  I don't want to go down on the sewer with this book. There's popcorn george
[1:35:49.020 --> 1:35:54.620]  There's peanuts and elephants and circuses in town and hot dogs and cotton candy
[1:35:55.740 --> 1:35:58.860]  That's fouchy. That's that's bill gates. That's joe biden
[1:35:58.860 --> 1:36:01.180]  Oh
[1:36:01.740 --> 1:36:04.540]  Come on down and get vaccinated
[1:36:04.940 --> 1:36:11.020]  You're like, wait a second. The vaccine is killing people and it's causing mutations and and and vaccinated people are saying
[1:36:11.500 --> 1:36:13.340]  That they're spreading it now
[1:36:13.340 --> 1:36:15.340]  But there's popcorn
[1:36:15.820 --> 1:36:21.340]  But there's 100 dollars. I mean literally remember there you get free doughnuts. You get free beers
[1:36:21.740 --> 1:36:24.940]  You get for all this free garbage to take their
[1:36:24.940 --> 1:36:30.780]  Their experimental vaccine that could kill you better than a hammer paralyze you make you amputate your your hands and legs
[1:36:31.500 --> 1:36:33.500]  These are all real cases
[1:36:33.900 --> 1:36:38.940]  And and we don't even have the basic instinct like like parents and children when you teach your kids
[1:36:39.260 --> 1:36:42.940]  You don't get in the van with the guy offering you an ice cream cone
[1:36:43.340 --> 1:36:46.700]  You don't get in the truck with the guy offering you a lollipop
[1:36:47.660 --> 1:36:51.020]  That's who these people are. Why would you get in the van with them?
[1:36:51.020 --> 1:36:55.420]  To be medically raped by these demonic psychotics
[1:36:58.300 --> 1:37:05.260]  Sin government asks ncoc to block sim cards social media accounts of unvaccinated people. Yeah, they don't want you
[1:37:06.060 --> 1:37:08.620]  Telling people hey, I didn't get the vaccine and I'm fine
[1:37:09.740 --> 1:37:14.300]  Australian military to help enforce cindy covet 19 lockdown as cases rise
[1:37:14.620 --> 1:37:18.620]  By the way, oh cases rise. There's like seven cases on the entire continent
[1:37:18.620 --> 1:37:23.660]  Yeah, cases rise. We went from five cases to seven in australia. It's a serious pandemic
[1:37:24.780 --> 1:37:30.460]  Again, it's like in washington dc where they just went back to total covet tyranny four covet deaths in the last two weeks
[1:37:30.780 --> 1:37:33.980]  Four covet deaths in the last two weeks 11 homicides
[1:37:35.100 --> 1:37:40.780]  The democrats are the virus the mainstream media is the virus you want to get rid of the virus?
[1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:45.100]  Get rid of the democrat party get rid of the mainstream media then you'll get rid of the virus
[1:37:45.100 --> 1:37:47.100]  Then you'll get rid of the virus
[1:37:48.540 --> 1:37:50.540]  It's just incredible and by the way
[1:37:52.540 --> 1:37:55.260]  I'm hosting the war room today. It's the veterans call-in show
[1:37:56.060 --> 1:37:59.420]  I think today's veterans call-in show on the war room three to six p.m. Central
[1:37:59.980 --> 1:38:02.940]  Streaming live at band out video. I think this is going to be a very powerful one
[1:38:03.900 --> 1:38:09.100]  Because I know that our great veterans in this country to put everything on the line for this country are just
[1:38:10.140 --> 1:38:12.140]  Flipping mad right now
[1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:17.980]  And they it's it's beyond the mistreatment that veterans have had for so many years
[1:38:18.060 --> 1:38:22.540]  It's beyond coming back to the west and seeing all of your freedoms ripped away
[1:38:22.940 --> 1:38:28.140]  It's now reached a point where veterans don't even recognize this country anymore and they sit here and they think
[1:38:28.860 --> 1:38:30.860]  They've been they've traveled the world
[1:38:31.900 --> 1:38:33.900]  to fight for freedom
[1:38:33.900 --> 1:38:36.380]  And now there's more oppression and more tyranny
[1:38:37.100 --> 1:38:40.860]  And more crime in the united states than the countries where they did tours at
[1:38:40.860 --> 1:38:44.860]  So today's veterans call-in show in the war room is going to be a must listen
[1:38:45.420 --> 1:38:48.700]  Uh, we're trying to get connected to alex. We may have them on the other side of this break
[1:38:48.780 --> 1:38:55.100]  But hey see an end Fauci biden all admit the vaccines are spreading the disease and causing mutations

[1:40:25.020 --> 1:40:34.060]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought you know, well, maybe that's what I need to do because I just thought it was a hopeless situation
[1:40:34.140 --> 1:40:37.180]  But when I started taking it, I mean it doesn't happen immediately
[1:40:37.260 --> 1:40:44.620]  But you know over a period of time I started noticing. Okay, you know, this is a ticket. This is working. This is wonderful
[1:40:44.700 --> 1:40:50.140]  You know, I don't I don't have to put on derma blend anymore. You know, so anyway
[1:40:50.140 --> 1:40:54.940]  It worked wonderfully and it really has totally cleared up my skin
[1:40:56.940 --> 1:41:00.300]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're
[1:41:00.540 --> 1:41:05.020]  Super computers controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go what we do
[1:41:05.100 --> 1:41:09.100]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate
[1:41:09.260 --> 1:41:13.820]  I still have one because this trojan horse this permethean fire has a lot of power
[1:41:13.820 --> 1:41:20.380]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com
[1:41:20.780 --> 1:41:23.260]  We finally got them back in stock the highest rated

[1:43:26.620 --> 1:43:30.380]  Quick clip here from a doctor
[1:43:31.260 --> 1:43:33.260]  Who has decided to quit his job?
[1:43:34.380 --> 1:43:37.820]  Like many great nurses who were heroes a year ago being on the front lines
[1:43:37.820 --> 1:43:41.660]  But now don't want to be forced inoculated with a deadly experimental vaccine now all of a sudden
[1:43:41.660 --> 1:43:45.420]  They're the zeros of their communities. It's amazing how quickly establishment will turn on you
[1:43:45.420 --> 1:43:47.580]  It's amazing how quickly a liberal democrat will turn on you
[1:43:48.860 --> 1:43:50.860]  And this doctor explains why
[1:43:51.820 --> 1:43:53.820]  He left his job as a doctor
[1:43:53.820 --> 1:43:59.260]  And of course it has to do with the covid tyranny and the forced vaccines here he is
[1:44:02.220 --> 1:44:04.940]  Hi everyone, um, my name is dr. Sam
[1:44:05.980 --> 1:44:07.980]  I just want to share a story with you today
[1:44:09.020 --> 1:44:11.020]  About how I came to resign
[1:44:11.660 --> 1:44:13.660]  In the beginning of the year really
[1:44:13.660 --> 1:44:15.660]  I had a job for life. I was a
[1:44:16.220 --> 1:44:18.220]  Partner in a GP practice
[1:44:18.220 --> 1:44:23.580]  I've been a doctor since 2004. So 17 years
[1:44:23.580 --> 1:44:25.900]  The last 11 in general practice
[1:44:26.540 --> 1:44:30.460]  Uh, also until recently working in the emergency department
[1:44:31.100 --> 1:44:35.820]  And a few years before that I helped run a palliative care hospice as well
[1:44:37.340 --> 1:44:40.780]  I had to go because that was the only thing I could do really
[1:44:41.340 --> 1:44:43.340]  Um because of the lies
[1:44:43.340 --> 1:44:52.140]  Uh, and the lies over the last year or so have been so vast. Um, it's been impossible to stomach or tolerate
[1:44:52.860 --> 1:44:55.420]  I went to medical school in good faith
[1:44:56.140 --> 1:44:58.940]  Because I wanted to help people and make a difference
[1:45:00.460 --> 1:45:02.460]  And that's not what's happened
[1:45:02.460 --> 1:45:04.300]  this year and
[1:45:04.300 --> 1:45:06.300]  it's been as if
[1:45:06.300 --> 1:45:10.860]  My hands and those of many other doctors and nurses who perhaps a bit afraid to come forward
[1:45:10.860 --> 1:45:13.740]  Uh, have had their hands tied behind their backs
[1:45:15.340 --> 1:45:16.780]  So
[1:45:16.780 --> 1:45:18.620]  There are treatments available
[1:45:18.620 --> 1:45:26.220]  Safe treatments, proven treatments with lots of evidence to back that up including treatments like hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin
[1:45:27.180 --> 1:45:31.020]  Which can be used as both pro prophylaxis and in treatment
[1:45:32.060 --> 1:45:35.260]  Even a simple inhaler called bedesenide
[1:45:36.140 --> 1:45:38.140]  has been found to be affected by
[1:45:38.140 --> 1:45:40.860]  A doctor who works in the emergency department in the states
[1:45:41.740 --> 1:45:43.020]  um
[1:45:43.020 --> 1:45:48.700]  So what i'm asking today is that uh, you do your own research and i'm going to tag in this video
[1:45:49.420 --> 1:45:53.180]  um, a lot of doctors, uh, perhaps more eminent than myself
[1:45:54.780 --> 1:45:56.780]  Who've done a lot of work
[1:45:57.020 --> 1:45:59.020]  Exposing what's going on
[1:46:00.300 --> 1:46:06.460]  Now let's talk about there's uh more to this video, but that's just kind of the meat of it right there
[1:46:06.460 --> 1:46:09.580]  And you know what that's the answer ladies and gentlemen
[1:46:10.860 --> 1:46:12.860]  That's the answer
[1:46:12.860 --> 1:46:14.860]  and the problem is
[1:46:15.820 --> 1:46:17.820]  Our economies
[1:46:19.180 --> 1:46:23.740]  Have been so rigged our monetary supplies have been so rigged by the establishment
[1:46:25.500 --> 1:46:27.500]  That
[1:46:27.820 --> 1:46:32.700]  Most people sadly whether it's police officers or doctors or what have you
[1:46:32.700 --> 1:46:38.860]  Can't afford to take the risk of quitting their job because they need the money to pay bills
[1:46:39.420 --> 1:46:42.380]  Uh, you know to help their family whatever the case may be
[1:46:43.980 --> 1:46:45.980]  But that's the answer ladies and gentlemen
[1:46:47.660 --> 1:46:53.900]  People inside mainstream media networks need to just start blowing the whistle on on all the fake news stuff that they see behind the scenes
[1:46:53.900 --> 1:46:55.900]  You're seeing that with project veritas
[1:46:55.900 --> 1:47:03.180]  People inside police departments, but specifically the capital police need to come forward and quit their job and make statements about
[1:47:03.180 --> 1:47:06.540]  How politicize and corrupt the capital police has become by the democrat party
[1:47:07.660 --> 1:47:11.260]  Doctors and nurses and we've seen so many but it's it needs to just be
[1:47:13.420 --> 1:47:16.940]  Just a tidal wave of them need to come forward much like that doctor and said look
[1:47:18.300 --> 1:47:20.300]  I got into medicine to help people
[1:47:20.300 --> 1:47:25.500]  And right now the system is not letting me help people and and I have to come across
[1:47:26.060 --> 1:47:30.380]  Covid patients every day and I can't even treat them with things we know work
[1:47:31.820 --> 1:47:35.020]  And perhaps the canary in the coal mine is actually Mexico right now
[1:47:36.460 --> 1:47:38.460]  in Mexico
[1:47:39.260 --> 1:47:44.540]  Doctors are allowed to treat covid with hydroxychloroquine and with ivermectin
[1:47:44.780 --> 1:47:47.900]  You notice how you don't hear about covid cases in Mexico
[1:47:47.900 --> 1:47:54.620]  You notice how you don't hear about big covid number deaths in Mexico. You know why because their doctors are allowed to do their job
[1:47:56.620 --> 1:48:03.100]  Hydroxychloroquine with zinc and vitamin D and other things works against covid ivermectin works against covid
[1:48:03.340 --> 1:48:05.340]  Those are just two treatments that people know work
[1:48:06.620 --> 1:48:09.100]  So think about how sick and corrupt
[1:48:09.820 --> 1:48:12.540]  The medical establishment is and the mainstream media is
[1:48:12.540 --> 1:48:16.780]  That they would keep known cures for covid
[1:48:18.380 --> 1:48:20.380]  from the public
[1:48:20.540 --> 1:48:23.980]  That right there that crime against humanity right there needs to be punished
[1:48:24.540 --> 1:48:25.660]  immediately
[1:48:25.660 --> 1:48:31.740]  And they'll never be held accountable. Anthony Fauci will never be held accountable, but I hope he will be I hope Anthony Fauci
[1:48:32.940 --> 1:48:36.700]  Endures a similar style or just the same thing as the Nuremberg trials
[1:48:37.580 --> 1:48:39.580]  and he's made an example of
[1:48:39.580 --> 1:48:43.500]  We're no longer going to have corrupt people like Anthony Fauci running our healthcare systems
[1:48:44.540 --> 1:48:48.060]  And if anybody has corrupt as Anthony Fauci tries to get in control again
[1:48:48.700 --> 1:48:52.540]  Just know your fate will be whatever Anthony Fauci's fate is so
[1:48:53.740 --> 1:48:57.580]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, that's a doctor who quit his job
[1:48:58.220 --> 1:49:02.060]  Because they weren't letting him help patients think about how sick that is
[1:49:02.540 --> 1:49:07.660]  Again, you would say that doesn't make sense when you understand that the system wants you dead
[1:49:07.660 --> 1:49:14.220]  When you understand that this is a global eugenics program of population control on planet earth
[1:49:14.700 --> 1:49:19.500]  Then it makes sense until you accept that reality. None of this will make sense
[1:49:20.060 --> 1:49:24.780]  But as soon as you have that realization everything you're seeing makes all the sense in the world
[1:49:25.420 --> 1:49:28.620]  These people don't want to help you. They want you dead
[1:49:31.820 --> 1:49:33.980]  So it's time for more whistleblowers to come forward
[1:49:33.980 --> 1:49:37.900]  It's time for whistleblowers to come forward out of the DC police and say, hey, you know what?
[1:49:38.780 --> 1:49:43.420]  We were told to stand down the police that they put on Capitol Hill. Well, everyone's running it
[1:49:43.980 --> 1:49:46.940]  Mario Bowser told us not to have more security
[1:49:48.460 --> 1:49:51.500]  I'm a officer in the DC police and I know that all this went on
[1:49:53.820 --> 1:49:56.780]  You need to have other doctors come forward and we've had so many
[1:49:56.780 --> 1:50:01.420]  But there just needs to be such a tidal wave that the media can't cover it up of doctors just like that
[1:50:01.420 --> 1:50:03.500]  Saying I have to sit here
[1:50:04.140 --> 1:50:08.620]  And I have to watch covid patients come in and out of these clinics in and out of these hospitals
[1:50:09.100 --> 1:50:11.100]  And we're not even allowed to help them
[1:50:11.900 --> 1:50:16.460]  We're told to just let them die or put them on a ventilator to murder them quicker
[1:50:19.580 --> 1:50:23.820]  And I don't know if that is an inevitability but that is
[1:50:25.340 --> 1:50:29.580]  One of the ways that we can finally maybe get out of this tyranny is just
[1:50:29.580 --> 1:50:31.820]  mass numbers of whistleblowers
[1:50:36.460 --> 1:50:38.940]  Let's go to this clip real quick
[1:50:39.340 --> 1:50:43.660]  of Representative Andy Biggs who is one of the great members of the Republican Party
[1:50:44.780 --> 1:50:51.580]  And setting the example for the rest of people here he is during a short press conference the other day talking about and accusing
[1:50:52.140 --> 1:50:56.700]  Adam Kinziger and Liz Cheney of being spies for the Democrat Party
[1:50:56.700 --> 1:51:01.660]  With that I've got we've got time for maybe two two questions
[1:51:13.900 --> 1:51:15.580]  Here's the deal
[1:51:15.580 --> 1:51:17.580]  A long time ago
[1:51:17.580 --> 1:51:18.780]  Liz Cheney
[1:51:18.780 --> 1:51:21.660]  Decided that she was going to take on the entire Republican conference
[1:51:21.660 --> 1:51:27.020]  And she was joined by Adam Kinziger. They chose to leave the conference
[1:51:27.900 --> 1:51:29.340]  Let me ask you this
[1:51:29.340 --> 1:51:33.180]  Would you like it if you're planning a strategy on how to defeat
[1:51:33.740 --> 1:51:38.460]  People who you think are actually tearing the country from stem to stern
[1:51:39.100 --> 1:51:43.020]  If you had two spies sitting right there, you knew there were spies, but you couldn't remove them
[1:51:43.660 --> 1:51:46.140]  Right now as long as they're members of the Republican conference
[1:51:46.540 --> 1:51:51.020]  They're entitled to come to every meeting we have here every strategy
[1:51:51.020 --> 1:51:53.420]  And you know what they chose to leave
[1:51:54.700 --> 1:51:58.460]  The big tense still there. They just have chosen to be on the outside of that big
[1:51:59.500 --> 1:52:00.540]  So there you go
[1:52:00.540 --> 1:52:05.740]  Andy Biggs calling it like it is and Adam Kinziger and Liz Cheney are spies for the Democrat Party
[1:52:06.300 --> 1:52:10.620]  Alex Jones joined us on the phone line shortly for the remainder of this segment. He'll be back in the next hour Alex
[1:52:11.580 --> 1:52:14.620]  So much developing right now. It seems every day
[1:52:15.340 --> 1:52:19.100]  Well, that's right. And again, they have asked me to host the fourth hour today
[1:52:19.100 --> 1:52:23.340]  So I just wanted to announce the listeners and I will be hosting the fourth hour today ahead of the war room
[1:52:23.660 --> 1:52:26.860]  Three to six p.m. So I will be hosting the third
[1:52:27.340 --> 1:52:30.860]  Fourth hour of my show today. So everyone knows and I'll be focused
[1:52:31.100 --> 1:52:35.900]  Got a bunch of clips and a lot of breaking news the information I'm going to have for folks to be a very important fourth hour
[1:52:36.700 --> 1:52:38.220]  separately
[1:52:38.220 --> 1:52:40.220]  Michael Rappaport, uh the
[1:52:41.020 --> 1:52:41.980]  weird
[1:52:41.980 --> 1:52:43.980]  You know movie tv character
[1:52:44.780 --> 1:52:46.780]  He's always attacking us
[1:52:46.780 --> 1:52:50.620]  Came out and said I took the vaccine. I'm a superhero. Why are you telling me I'm a super spreader?
[1:52:51.180 --> 1:52:55.980]  We offered him a hundred thousand dollars of his charity to come here and let us be programming and show him all the documents
[1:52:56.380 --> 1:53:03.100]  He attacked us and called us a bunch of names. Uh last night. We've now learned and so we'll be playing that in the fourth hour today
[1:53:03.500 --> 1:53:06.540]  But I saw you mentioned Matt Gates come out and exposed the FBI
[1:53:07.660 --> 1:53:12.700]  And exposed how they now are based on setting up criminal plots and how other Republicans are calling out the democrats criminals
[1:53:12.700 --> 1:53:16.620]  That's what we need to point out. We have a criminal occupational government
[1:53:17.020 --> 1:53:20.700]  We have to get down the brass tacks to prevent how much trouble we're in or it's only going to get worse
[1:53:20.940 --> 1:53:23.500]  So I'll also have that clip that heard you talk about earlier
[1:53:24.060 --> 1:53:26.060]  In the fourth hour, you're you're welcome to play it as well
[1:53:26.060 --> 1:53:29.660]  But uh heard you talking about it. So I thought we might actually want to play that clip
[1:53:29.980 --> 1:53:32.220]  We also have a bunch of other really important clips
[1:53:32.780 --> 1:53:34.780]  Uh that I'm going to be hitting in the fourth hour today
[1:53:35.100 --> 1:53:37.980]  But I just want to push her to know that Rappaport has responded and
[1:53:37.980 --> 1:53:42.700]  It's not about Rappaport and we think he's powerful and famous. So we wanted to offer him the money
[1:53:42.780 --> 1:53:44.780]  He's so stupid face in front of us
[1:53:45.420 --> 1:53:48.780]  As we predicted the globalists are now launching a new lockdown
[1:53:49.100 --> 1:53:54.300]  The first one has already destroyed the third world already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death
[1:53:54.540 --> 1:53:57.900]  And it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world
[1:53:58.620 --> 1:54:04.220]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time for you to get high-quality storeable food that's ready to ship while you still can at
[1:54:04.220 --> 1:54:08.620]  2020 prices. We have the biggest best company in the united states as our supplier

[1:54:14.540 --> 1:54:18.700]  But only for one more week. They've told us you can extend it one more week alex
[1:54:19.020 --> 1:54:24.940]  But that's it. They won't do this sale again until november and then the food prices go up in 2022
[1:54:25.180 --> 1:54:30.540]  This is insurance you can eat. It's the highest quality hundreds of high quality foods three months six months your supplies
[1:54:30.540 --> 1:54:36.940]  All ready for you at infowarstore.com recall toll free triple eight two five three three one three nine
[1:54:37.180 --> 1:54:41.500]  Again infowarstore.com 10 off on high quality storeable food ready to ship
[1:54:41.660 --> 1:54:45.260]  But it ends in just one week. So take action now while you still can
[1:54:47.660 --> 1:54:50.940]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology
[1:54:51.660 --> 1:54:53.660]  The criminologists all agree on
[1:54:54.380 --> 1:54:57.420]  That its criminals are extremely pathological
[1:54:57.420 --> 1:55:01.340]  But even more the general public they do the same things over and over again
[1:55:01.580 --> 1:55:06.060]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again
[1:55:07.100 --> 1:55:11.980]  Well, guess what it was anthony fouchy and eugenesis globalist that
[1:55:13.020 --> 1:55:18.780]  Ran the rollout of hiv and the mistreatment of it with azt and other chemicals that actually killed more people
[1:55:19.020 --> 1:55:22.060]  That hiv and they were the ones involved in viral research
[1:55:22.060 --> 1:55:28.060]  Of viruses that would actually go attack the t-limbs besides the body and create autoimmune disorders
[1:55:28.620 --> 1:55:34.540]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down the road
[1:55:35.020 --> 1:55:41.340]  That's why they need to roll out the covet 19 and the vaccine because now they admit the covet 19 vaccine destroys your immune system
[1:55:41.660 --> 1:55:45.500]  Basically giving you the equivalent of hiv. That's right ladies and gentlemen
[1:55:45.500 --> 1:55:52.300]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[1:56:16.460 --> 1:56:18.460]  All right
[1:56:19.500 --> 1:56:22.860]  I want to read this statement from greg abbott
[1:56:24.060 --> 1:56:28.780]  I think i'll have time to do it. Let me just pre text pre pre preface this with a couple headlines
[1:56:29.260 --> 1:56:34.860]  Biden administration warns texas governor greg abbott to undo dangerous and unlawful executive order
[1:56:34.860 --> 1:56:36.860]  I mean talk about projection
[1:56:37.100 --> 1:56:39.100]  They have a wide open southern border
[1:56:39.340 --> 1:56:42.700]  Rapists murderers just the worst kind of people pouring over
[1:56:42.700 --> 1:56:46.380]  They're bringing over disease and and deadly drugs and guns and everything
[1:56:47.500 --> 1:56:51.180]  But the by administration says oh, it's dangerous and unlawful to close the border. I mean
[1:56:52.140 --> 1:56:57.580]  That is so insane. Merritt garland needs to be committed to a psych ward and put in a rubber room
[1:56:58.380 --> 1:57:00.700]  And harnessed immediately. I mean that's just a joke
[1:57:01.260 --> 1:57:06.060]  Department of justice threatens to sue texas over its steps to stop illegal aliens from spreading disease
[1:57:06.700 --> 1:57:11.820]  So again, the by administration is criminal on its face. Merritt garland needs to be arrested for treason
[1:57:11.820 --> 1:57:14.460]  Here is governor abbott's response
[1:57:15.260 --> 1:57:17.260]  today
[1:57:17.420 --> 1:57:24.060]  It is clear that the biden administration fundamentally misunderstands what is truly happening at the texas mexico border. Well, that's not true
[1:57:24.140 --> 1:57:27.980]  But uh, okay, they know what they're doing the current crisis at our southern border
[1:57:27.980 --> 1:57:32.460]  Including the overcrowding of immigration facilities and the devastating spread of covet 19
[1:57:32.860 --> 1:57:39.580]  That the influx of non-citizens is causing is entirely the creation of the biden administration and its failed immigration policies
[1:57:39.580 --> 1:57:46.620]  By choosing not to enforce immigration laws removing sound policies like the remain in mexico program and failing to make the most
[1:57:47.020 --> 1:57:53.340]  robust use of title 42 authorities the administration has directly caused the unprecedented crisis texas is facing
[1:57:53.660 --> 1:58:01.660]  And it is increasingly a matter of grave public health concern as unlawful migrants enter from countries with lower vaccination rates than the united states
[1:58:02.300 --> 1:58:04.300]  And then they actually refuse to get vaccinated too
[1:58:04.940 --> 1:58:06.780]  Which is there right? I don't blame them
[1:58:06.780 --> 1:58:08.700]  it would be
[1:58:08.700 --> 1:58:14.860]  It would be of some solace if the federal government were conducting appropriate covet 19 testing and other mitigation strategies
[1:58:14.940 --> 1:58:19.660]  But to the contrary we hear too many reports of the federal government recklessly failing to do so
[1:58:19.900 --> 1:58:24.300]  And instead admitting into the united states and texas migrants from over 150
[1:58:24.860 --> 1:58:27.740]  Countries many of whom are testing positive for covet 19
[1:58:28.860 --> 1:58:30.140]  in short
[1:58:30.140 --> 1:58:36.060]  The biden administration is jeopardizing the health and safety of texas on a daily basis by refusing to follow the law
[1:58:36.060 --> 1:58:42.780]  And it's not just texas these irresponsible policies and actions by the biden administration are endangering the lives of many americans
[1:58:43.020 --> 1:58:45.500]  As well as the unlawful immigrants themselves
[1:58:45.740 --> 1:58:52.540]  I will take every available step consistent with the law to fulfill my duty to protect the health and safety of all texas now
[1:58:53.580 --> 1:58:55.820]  We'll see how far governor Abbott actually goes with this
[1:58:56.060 --> 1:58:58.700]  He's he announced a policy that was supposed to start today
[1:58:59.420 --> 1:59:01.420]  That the texas government
[1:59:01.420 --> 1:59:08.060]  Was going to be arresting illegal immigrants coming across the southern border. So the biden administration official policy is that the border is open
[1:59:08.620 --> 1:59:13.340]  The biden administration official policy is that border patrol if and when they make apprehensions
[1:59:13.580 --> 1:59:17.900]  They're supposed to complete the illegal immigration process and bring them into the united states
[1:59:18.300 --> 1:59:20.540]  And then the democrats have set up the infrastructure
[1:59:21.820 --> 1:59:23.820]  Through catholic charities and other organizations
[1:59:23.820 --> 1:59:30.620]  For the pipeline infrastructure in the united states of america that once they get in they get taken to these democrat
[1:59:31.420 --> 1:59:38.700]  Charity facilities and then they get moved about the country on your taxpayer dime now info wars has exposed this at nauseam
[1:59:39.820 --> 1:59:41.100]  and
[1:59:41.100 --> 1:59:47.100]  We're going to be having uh our new reporter coming on air here today. I think I don't know everything's just kind of you never know
[1:59:47.100 --> 1:59:50.940]  What's going to happen here? Uh, who's been down at the border exposing this again? So
[1:59:50.940 --> 1:59:52.940]  So, but what is the answer to this?
[1:59:54.060 --> 1:59:58.300]  The answer to this is for republicans to get more hardcore and and actually
[1:59:59.500 --> 2:00:01.660]  Execute the plans they're talking about. So, yeah
[2:00:02.540 --> 2:00:07.100]  We should be in texas deciding we have a southern border. We're going to close the border here
[2:00:07.180 --> 2:00:09.180]  We're going to arrest illegal immigrants
[2:00:09.340 --> 2:00:13.980]  And and whatever happens with border patrol. We'll just have to face that when we get to that point but
[2:00:15.660 --> 2:00:17.980]  Merrick garland needs to be arrested
[2:00:17.980 --> 2:00:22.700]  And so this is what republicans need to do and maybe they're getting close to doing it
[2:00:22.860 --> 2:00:29.260]  We saw texas republicans send saying the sergeant at arms has the right to arrest the texas democrats that fled the state
[2:00:29.740 --> 2:00:34.460]  That's a nice start greg abbott saying we're going to arrest illegal immigrants coming across the southern border
[2:00:34.460 --> 2:00:38.220]  We're not going to have an open border. That's a good start. But let's get real hardcore
[2:00:38.940 --> 2:00:42.060]  Let's get real hardcore and let's say it's time to arrest
[2:00:42.060 --> 2:00:49.020]  Merrick garland and it's time to arrest joe biden for committing the treason of having a wide open southern border
[2:00:49.100 --> 2:00:53.660]  And treating illegal immigrants with more rights than americans have what's called for their arrest
[2:00:54.780 --> 2:01:00.380]  Hello, i'm mike lindell and i'm coming to you with the most important commercial that i've ever done

[2:01:53.740 --> 2:02:07.100]  You're listening to the antidote for fake news. It's alex jones
[2:02:12.140 --> 2:02:14.140]  When shroyer in studio
[2:02:15.180 --> 2:02:16.700]  Here's a great
[2:02:16.700 --> 2:02:18.140]  statement from
[2:02:18.140 --> 2:02:20.140]  Ted Cruz
[2:02:20.140 --> 2:02:26.860]  I'll admit I underestimated just how radical democrats would become they love power. It's like a drug to them
[2:02:27.820 --> 2:02:35.660]  And they can't stop issuing mandates mask mandates vaccine mandates shutdowns and closed schools all while the corrupt corporate media cheers them on
[2:02:36.620 --> 2:02:38.460]  exactly
[2:02:38.460 --> 2:02:40.860]  And again, it's just like president trump said
[2:02:41.420 --> 2:02:45.420]  He's like, you know, I knew it was bad, but I got into the white house and I didn't realize it was this bad
[2:02:45.420 --> 2:02:53.580]  Because you assume that hey, you know what people aren't perfect and people have different political ideologies and different means to end goals and you know
[2:02:54.140 --> 2:02:59.820]  But you get into dc you get involved in politics and you have a good you have a good heart and you have a good mind and you
[2:03:00.380 --> 2:03:05.180]  You have a good soul and you just want to help people doesn't mean you're going to do everything right doesn't mean you're going to get along with everybody
[2:03:05.180 --> 2:03:10.620]  Doesn't mean everyone's going to agree, but you know, you're in it for the right reasons and you figure. Hey, you know, I'm trying to help people here
[2:03:11.180 --> 2:03:13.180]  Why would I be getting this resistance?
[2:03:13.180 --> 2:03:20.860]  And that's when trump realizes. Oh, this isn't I'm not these aren't politicians that we're not doing politics. This is just straight up evil
[2:03:21.980 --> 2:03:25.820]  That's why he said the media was the enemy of the people because they are
[2:03:26.620 --> 2:03:32.060]  The media wants to lie to you 24 7 whether it's about trump whether it's about covet whether it's about george floyd
[2:03:32.220 --> 2:03:36.300]  Doesn't matter their agenda is to lie to you. That's the enemy of the people
[2:03:36.860 --> 2:03:38.860]  That's the mainstream media. That's the democrat party
[2:03:38.860 --> 2:03:42.220]  So now it is
[2:03:43.580 --> 2:03:45.740]  Ted Cruz who is understanding it
[2:03:46.780 --> 2:03:52.780]  Folks, we're not dealing this isn't politics as usual. This isn't this isn't your grandfather's democrat party
[2:03:53.180 --> 2:03:55.180]  This is the party of satan
[2:03:55.660 --> 2:03:57.660]  These are satan's minions
[2:03:59.340 --> 2:04:02.620]  Coming crashing down on our country like a meteor shower
[2:04:02.620 --> 2:04:11.180]  Oh my gosh, and now biden is literally drooling all over his chin
[2:04:12.620 --> 2:04:15.420]  During a wildfire briefing my god
[2:04:16.860 --> 2:04:18.860]  I mean folks this guy
[2:04:20.220 --> 2:04:22.220]  Jeez
[2:04:23.660 --> 2:04:28.140]  We're already in a civil war ladies and gentlemen in case you haven't noticed it's a cold civil war
[2:04:28.140 --> 2:04:32.300]  Even though democrats have murdered multiple people democrats
[2:04:32.860 --> 2:04:39.020]  Democrats murdered people in portland democrats murdered people in denver democrats murdered people in washington dc on january 6
[2:04:39.100 --> 2:04:43.580]  So the democrats have taken it hot. They've murdered a bunch of people. They've arrested a bunch of people
[2:04:43.900 --> 2:04:47.500]  So for the democrats, they're in a hot civil war right now. They want to kill you
[2:04:48.220 --> 2:04:52.220]  They want to they want to enslave you they want to imprison you and they want to kill you. That's no joke
[2:04:53.900 --> 2:04:55.900]  Ask ashley babbitt
[2:04:55.900 --> 2:05:02.620]  Ask people rotting in jail for being in dc on january 6. The democrats are in a hot civil war right now
[2:05:02.700 --> 2:05:06.780]  They're murdering people. They're enslaving people. They're torturing people. They're imprisoning people
[2:05:08.220 --> 2:05:13.340]  So when are the republicans finally going to respond to this with the necessary fervor?
[2:05:16.060 --> 2:05:20.940]  See we're still in this cold civil war informational warfare narrative warfare
[2:05:20.940 --> 2:05:28.060]  Where we're just trying to combat all their lies and just try to awaken the public about how dastardly they are
[2:05:28.940 --> 2:05:34.940]  They're already out murdering people. They're already out bringing in political prisoners. They're not messing around
[2:05:38.060 --> 2:05:40.060]  So
[2:05:40.700 --> 2:05:42.700]  And I'll tell you
[2:05:43.260 --> 2:05:44.860]  2022
[2:05:44.860 --> 2:05:49.260]  The midterm elections, which we we already have started a countdown. I mean, I don't bother with it
[2:05:49.260 --> 2:05:52.860]  but there's 466 days till the midterm elections
[2:05:53.660 --> 2:05:55.180]  and
[2:05:55.180 --> 2:05:57.180]  Here's the thing
[2:05:58.060 --> 2:06:01.020]  This is why the democrats are in total panic right now
[2:06:02.220 --> 2:06:04.220]  about the election audit
[2:06:04.540 --> 2:06:09.340]  This is why merit garland is saying it's illegal for states to do election audits. It's just total bs
[2:06:10.380 --> 2:06:12.380]  because
[2:06:12.380 --> 2:06:19.100]  As soon as americans realize that we haven't had a real election in this country for a long long time
[2:06:19.180 --> 2:06:22.700]  They're going to demand election reform ahead of the midterms
[2:06:23.660 --> 2:06:27.500]  So that's why they're panicked over this audit. That's why they don't like all this information getting out
[2:06:28.060 --> 2:06:34.140]  I mean seriously any serious person who's not a pathological liar and who's not intellectually dishonest with themselves
[2:06:34.620 --> 2:06:38.380]  Knows that biden did not win the 2020 election knows it knows it was stolen
[2:06:38.380 --> 2:06:41.740]  Uh, you know as obvious as videos we see coming out of
[2:06:42.460 --> 2:06:48.700]  California where guys just walk into walmarts and targets and just load up grocery bags and load up trash bags and load up
[2:06:48.700 --> 2:06:51.260]  Backpacks with stolen goods and just walk out the front door
[2:06:52.540 --> 2:06:55.260]  Because the new democrat policy is you just let people steal
[2:06:56.380 --> 2:06:59.660]  And then all these businesses shut down they go out of business because they can't do anything
[2:06:59.820 --> 2:07:03.660]  They just get all their all their merchandise gets robbed and they have no recourse
[2:07:03.660 --> 2:07:12.220]  It was as obvious as it was as obvious as the sun is in the sky on a on a cloudless day
[2:07:14.540 --> 2:07:18.700]  And if we had a real midterm election in 2022
[2:07:20.140 --> 2:07:26.860]  There's going to be republicans that get into office that aren't there to mess around not there to play politics
[2:07:27.340 --> 2:07:29.420]  Not there because there's an r behind their name
[2:07:29.420 --> 2:07:33.820]  But they're there because they realize the enemies of america are in the halls of congress
[2:07:34.140 --> 2:07:38.140]  They're there because they realize the enemies of america are on the mainstream media
[2:07:38.620 --> 2:07:40.620]  And they actually want to do something about it
[2:07:41.420 --> 2:07:46.700]  Not just play patty cake not just get into congress and slap hands and hang out with mitch mcconnell
[2:07:46.860 --> 2:07:50.620]  No, they want to get in there and actually save this country from damnation
[2:07:51.420 --> 2:07:53.420]  That the democrats are bringing down on us
[2:07:53.420 --> 2:07:57.660]  And so it's it's it's insulting
[2:07:58.620 --> 2:08:03.660]  That we have to deal with joe biden who earlier this week runs up to the media gaggle and says that he's wiped his butt
[2:08:04.380 --> 2:08:08.220]  It's embarrassing that we have to deal with the president who's about to have a press conference
[2:08:08.300 --> 2:08:14.620]  And he's so out of it just probably bombed out on drugs that he's drooling from his mouth down his chin
[2:08:15.100 --> 2:08:18.540]  Drool dripping off of his chin as he's about to have a major press conference
[2:08:18.540 --> 2:08:23.340]  Literally, I mean we just we just showed you
[2:08:24.780 --> 2:08:26.780]  And they have to send him a note
[2:08:27.740 --> 2:08:31.740]  Telling him to wipe his chin because he's drooling. What are you going to do put a bib on him next?
[2:08:32.780 --> 2:08:37.180]  Yeah, joe biden needs a bib to stop from drooling on national tv
[2:08:38.940 --> 2:08:40.940]  Because he's not even there
[2:08:42.060 --> 2:08:45.500]  Again, I keep going back to this but the media still hasn't mentioned it at all
[2:08:45.500 --> 2:08:47.500]  So
[2:08:48.380 --> 2:08:52.700]  The biden white house or who knows who we don't have any answers
[2:08:53.340 --> 2:08:57.100]  Somebody is ordering airstrikes in samalia right now
[2:08:57.900 --> 2:08:59.900]  Nobody knows who
[2:09:00.140 --> 2:09:02.140]  biden doesn't know it's going on
[2:09:02.620 --> 2:09:09.660]  And even the democrat party didn't know it was going on and they raised hell about it in congress and they said wait a second
[2:09:10.860 --> 2:09:14.380]  We've been we've been airstriking samalia. There was no vote on this
[2:09:14.380 --> 2:09:18.620]  There was no nobody even brought it up. We just turned around all of a sudden. We're bombing samalia
[2:09:19.500 --> 2:09:21.500]  Who made that call?
[2:09:21.660 --> 2:09:23.660]  who
[2:09:25.180 --> 2:09:27.180]  See that's how dangerous it is right now
[2:09:28.140 --> 2:09:33.660]  That somehow our military is being ordered to bomb samalia and the orders aren't even coming from the white house
[2:09:33.740 --> 2:09:35.740]  The orders aren't even coming from the president
[2:09:38.140 --> 2:09:41.740]  Like that is code red ladies and gentlemen
[2:09:41.740 --> 2:09:51.740]  I mean that's almost beyond even all the covet tyranny almost beyond joe biden drooling from his chin during a live press conference
[2:09:53.740 --> 2:09:55.740]  Our military is being ordered
[2:09:56.380 --> 2:10:02.380]  To do airstrikes in samalia and nobody even knows who's in charge. Nobody knows who's you giving out the orders
[2:10:02.940 --> 2:10:06.140]  biden doesn't know what's going on the democrat party doesn't know what's going on
[2:10:06.940 --> 2:10:11.260]  Congress doesn't know what's going on the american people don't know what's going on the media doesn't know what's going on
[2:10:11.260 --> 2:10:18.460]  Somebody is ordering our military right now under biden's watch to bomb samalia and nobody knows who
[2:10:21.580 --> 2:10:28.220]  Biden hasn't made a comment who knows who even knows where kamala harris is has anybody even seen or heard
[2:10:29.420 --> 2:10:31.580]  From willy brown's girlfriend in the last couple weeks
[2:10:33.260 --> 2:10:35.260]  As seriously
[2:10:35.260 --> 2:10:39.260]  So it's just totally out of control
[2:10:43.260 --> 2:10:49.260]  And it's nice to see the republicans fighting back against the mass mandates and there's all these different stories coming out about that and
[2:10:51.260 --> 2:10:59.260]  Liberal journalists in dc who hang out in in congress are like complaining that you know they see people in the hallways not wearing masks
[2:10:59.260 --> 2:11:01.260]  So they're just such good little slaves aren't they
[2:11:01.260 --> 2:11:09.260]  And you know i've got all these other news stories i need to cover like food prices are about to reach new highs thanks to the inflation
[2:11:09.260 --> 2:11:15.260]  Thanks to the economic shutdown all by design all by design to drive america into poverty
[2:11:15.260 --> 2:11:17.260]  So is it is it loyde austin
[2:11:17.260 --> 2:11:21.260]  Who wears a face shield and a mask running around in dc
[2:11:21.260 --> 2:11:27.260]  Is it loyde austin who's decided to take control of our military without telling anybody without a vote without nothing
[2:11:27.260 --> 2:11:31.260]  Who's ordering the u.s. military to do airstrikes in somalia who is it
[2:11:33.260 --> 2:11:35.260]  And why haven't they been arrested
[2:11:37.260 --> 2:11:45.260]  Because the democrat parties here ladies and gentlemen and they're here to seek to kill and to destroy the united states of america
[2:11:45.260 --> 2:11:49.260]  And if they're not stopped they might just be successful
[2:11:49.260 --> 2:11:51.260]  Hello i'm mike lindell
[2:11:51.260 --> 2:11:55.260]  And i'm coming to you with the most important commercial that i've ever done

[2:13:18.260 --> 2:13:26.260]  And then in 2024 you will again take two shots and he says it'll be whatever fizer cooks up and wants to put in your body
[2:13:26.260 --> 2:13:30.260]  This is the rocker feller foundation they developed this whole plan with bill gates
[2:13:30.260 --> 2:13:35.260]  They're now implementing it and now they've announced that the u.s. policy is set by the private rocker feller foundation
[2:13:35.260 --> 2:13:41.260]  Of course the rocker feller foundation by the 30s was the main funder of adolf alos hitler
[2:13:41.260 --> 2:13:45.260]  And the eugenics at cold springs harbour that train the coserville home institute in germany
[2:13:45.260 --> 2:13:49.260]  And bullwars will continue to set fast they fight this i don't know how long we can
[2:13:49.260 --> 2:13:54.260]  The enemy is coming for us all now and god bless and good luck i would again get right with god right now
[2:13:54.260 --> 2:13:58.260]  As we predicted the globalists are now launching a new lockdown
[2:13:58.260 --> 2:14:03.260]  The first one has already destroyed the third world already caused over 20 million extra people to starve to death
[2:14:03.260 --> 2:14:07.260]  And it's caused massive supply chain problems across the western world
[2:14:07.260 --> 2:14:13.260]  Ladies and gentlemen now is the time for you to get high quality storeable food that's ready to ship while you still can
[2:14:13.260 --> 2:14:18.260]  At 2020 prices we have the biggest best company in the united states as our supplier
[2:14:18.260 --> 2:14:23.260]  Their entire catalog is at infoworkstore.com you get an additional 10% off at infoworkstore.com
[2:14:23.260 --> 2:14:28.260]  But only for one more week they've told us you can extend it one more week alex
[2:14:28.260 --> 2:14:34.260]  But that's it they won't do this sale again until november and then the food prices go up in 2022
[2:14:34.260 --> 2:14:38.260]  This is insurance you can eat it's the highest quality hundreds of high quality foods
[2:14:38.260 --> 2:14:42.260]  Three months six month year supplies all ready for you at infoworkstore.com

[2:14:46.260 --> 2:14:52.260]  Again infoworkstore.com 10% off on high quality storeable food ready to ship but it ends in just one week
[2:14:52.260 --> 2:14:54.260]  So take action now while you still can
[2:14:54.260 --> 2:15:02.260]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:15:25.260 --> 2:15:27.260]  You know I want to thank
[2:15:27.260 --> 2:15:33.260]  Cory Bush who's a member of the radical democrat jihad squad
[2:15:33.260 --> 2:15:36.260]  She put up this tweet
[2:15:36.260 --> 2:15:42.260]  Is this the bipartisan infrastructure group or the audience at a kid rock concert
[2:15:42.260 --> 2:15:44.260]  Hashtag negotiation so white
[2:15:44.260 --> 2:15:46.260]  Yes
[2:15:46.260 --> 2:15:48.260]  Race jokes are back baby
[2:15:48.260 --> 2:15:51.260]  Race jokes are back
[2:15:51.260 --> 2:15:56.260]  And I thank Cory Bush for it. It's about time somebody brought race jokes back
[2:15:56.260 --> 2:16:01.260]  You wouldn't think it was the quote unquote anti racist democrat party who of course are the biggest racist of all
[2:16:01.260 --> 2:16:09.260]  But there it is so Cory Bush is bringing race jokes back and just doing it right on the right on the old twitter right there
[2:16:09.260 --> 2:16:18.260]  You got to love it. You got to love it. Cory Bush bringing race jokes back into the mainstream and I am here for it absolutely
[2:16:18.260 --> 2:16:20.260]  I think that's hilarious
[2:16:20.260 --> 2:16:24.260]  The audience at a kid rock concert
[2:16:24.260 --> 2:16:27.260]  I can get down with that. That's funny to me
[2:16:27.260 --> 2:16:36.260]  But you know anyway she's allowed to be racist I suppose of course she's an actual racist but that's not the point
[2:16:36.260 --> 2:16:39.260]  All right
[2:16:39.260 --> 2:16:49.260]  So you have republicans fighting back against Nancy Pelosi's mask mandate which by the way she's already violated on multiple occasions
[2:16:49.260 --> 2:16:53.260]  She's already violated her own mask mandate on multiple occasions
[2:16:53.260 --> 2:16:57.260]  Why isn't Nancy Pelosi in jail?
[2:16:57.260 --> 2:17:01.260]  For being in violation of her own mask mandate
[2:17:01.260 --> 2:17:14.260]  And then you have these republican staffers apparently in the one of the buildings
[2:17:14.260 --> 2:17:18.260]  The Rayburn building where republicans have offices
[2:17:18.260 --> 2:17:23.260]  Apparently having a party in the hallway
[2:17:23.260 --> 2:17:30.260]  As an exhibition of their freedom or as this liberal reporter says it
[2:17:30.260 --> 2:17:34.260]  Hard to show the full scope because it's a tight space and there are a bunch of people
[2:17:34.260 --> 2:17:38.260]  But it's about a hundred staff crammed together in a narrow hallway on the second floor
[2:17:38.260 --> 2:17:41.260]  Rayburn all unmasked
[2:17:41.260 --> 2:17:43.260]  They're playing water pong
[2:17:43.260 --> 2:17:45.260]  They even have cornhole
[2:17:45.260 --> 2:17:47.260]  I think I smelled a cigar
[2:17:47.260 --> 2:17:53.260]  A group of unmasked republican staffers are playing beer pong in the halls of the Rayburn house office building
[2:17:53.260 --> 2:18:02.260]  Presumably their need to demonstrate the exercise of freedoms is stronger than their sense of responsibility to justify taxpayer funded salaries
[2:18:02.260 --> 2:18:04.260]  Oh give me a break
[2:18:04.260 --> 2:18:07.260]  Taxpayer funded illegal immigration like the democrats do
[2:18:07.260 --> 2:18:10.260]  Taxpayer funded abortion like the democrats do
[2:18:10.260 --> 2:18:14.260]  Taxpayer funded trillions of dollars that the democrats just steal
[2:18:14.260 --> 2:18:23.260]  And I'm supposed to have a pity party about some republican staffers playing games in the hallway to show you that they're free
[2:18:23.260 --> 2:18:31.260]  Really I'm neutral on the activity but it's hilarious how it's triggering this liberal reporter and I mean he is really pissed folks
[2:18:31.260 --> 2:18:34.260]  I do not work in a fraternity house
[2:18:34.260 --> 2:18:37.260]  I don't know why these people felt the need to do this here
[2:18:37.260 --> 2:18:44.260]  But it is terrifying and horrifying that displays of decadent apathy
[2:18:44.260 --> 2:18:50.260]  Oh my gosh yeah he is really upset about this he doesn't work in a fraternity guys
[2:18:50.260 --> 2:18:56.260]  He doesn't work in a fraternity and this liberal loser doesn't like freedom
[2:18:56.260 --> 2:19:01.260]  Aaron Frischner hates freedom
[2:19:01.260 --> 2:19:04.260]  It's part of the prerequisites of being a democrat these days
[2:19:04.260 --> 2:19:09.260]  If there was a test kind of like you know there's a test to become a citizen there's a citizenship test
[2:19:09.260 --> 2:19:13.260]  There's the test to become a democrat first question is do you hate freedom
[2:19:13.260 --> 2:19:18.260]  And if you answer yes then you are allowed to be a democrat
[2:19:18.260 --> 2:19:26.260]  So you have to hate freedom you have to hate individual liberties in order to be a democrat or a liberal reporter in Washington DC
[2:19:26.260 --> 2:19:30.260]  Imagine triggering the left with freedom
[2:19:30.260 --> 2:19:33.260]  Triggering the democrats with freedom
[2:19:33.260 --> 2:19:36.260]  I think that tells you everything you need to know
[2:19:36.260 --> 2:19:43.260]  And then you have all of these republicans that met in the middle of the house floor
[2:19:43.260 --> 2:19:47.260]  Maskless and Andy Biggs tweets out the picture
[2:19:47.260 --> 2:19:55.260]  Today we sent a loud cleared message to Pelosi her tyrannical rule is not welcomed in the people's house
[2:19:55.260 --> 2:20:06.260]  And so again it's good to see leaders stepping up from the republican party Marjorie Taylor Greene, Louis Gomert, Chip Roy, Lauren Bobert, Madison Cawthorn
[2:20:06.260 --> 2:20:10.260]  And we're not going to agree with these people all the time
[2:20:10.260 --> 2:20:16.260]  Andy Biggs and the like, Paul Gosar the list goes on but damn it at least they're fighting for this country
[2:20:16.260 --> 2:20:19.260]  At least they're in congress fighting for this country
[2:20:19.260 --> 2:20:27.260]  At least we have some members of the republican party that are starting to form a backbone and a spine and their balls are starting to drop
[2:20:27.260 --> 2:20:34.260]  And they're finally willing to stand up against the democrat tyranny, against the democrat hatred of America
[2:20:34.260 --> 2:20:40.260]  And that's the best way to expose the democrats for what they are to the average americans who still don't get it
[2:20:40.260 --> 2:20:47.260]  Just show them you want to live free and watch the liberals see the
[2:20:47.260 --> 2:20:52.260]  Just show the democrats that you want to be free and watch the democrats see the
[2:20:52.260 --> 2:20:56.260]  They hate your freedom ladies and gentlemen
[2:20:56.260 --> 2:21:01.260]  They hate your freedom and whether there's a big deadly pandemic happening or not
[2:21:01.260 --> 2:21:05.260]  That does not suspend our rights
[2:21:05.260 --> 2:21:09.260]  Oh there's Nancy Pelosi breaking her own rule straight to jail please
[2:21:09.260 --> 2:21:12.260]  Straight to jail for Pelosi please
[2:21:12.260 --> 2:21:17.260]  I want that woman arrested immediately and locked up in the key to be thrown away or lost
[2:21:17.260 --> 2:21:23.260]  I mean as if Biden drooling during his own press conference isn't enough
[2:21:23.260 --> 2:21:25.260]  I mean that's Nancy Pelosi half the time anyway
[2:21:25.260 --> 2:21:28.260]  This woman's either so lit on alcohol
[2:21:28.260 --> 2:21:31.260]  I mean I hope that she's that drunk
[2:21:31.260 --> 2:21:33.260]  Otherwise it's maybe even worse than we thought
[2:21:33.260 --> 2:21:37.260]  Like I hope Nancy Pelosi is a severe alcoholic
[2:21:37.260 --> 2:21:41.260]  Otherwise her behavior is even more questionable
[2:21:41.260 --> 2:21:43.260]  Like oh she's just wasted on vodka half the time
[2:21:43.260 --> 2:21:45.260]  Oh okay that makes sense
[2:21:45.260 --> 2:21:49.260]  She reeks like a damn brewery
[2:21:49.260 --> 2:21:54.260]  That would actually be a bit of a good thing
[2:21:54.260 --> 2:21:55.260]  Didn't it just make sense
[2:21:55.260 --> 2:21:57.260]  Oh Pelosi's just drunk again
[2:21:57.260 --> 2:22:00.260]  But no she's a senile old bitch
[2:22:00.260 --> 2:22:06.260]  Nancy Pelosi is a senile old bitch
[2:22:06.260 --> 2:22:09.260]  That hates you, hates America, hates this country
[2:22:09.260 --> 2:22:13.260]  And needs to be removed from Congress immediately
[2:22:13.260 --> 2:22:17.260]  That woman is a clear and present danger to this country
[2:22:17.260 --> 2:22:25.260]  Nancy Pelosi is a clear and present danger to everything that we hold dear
[2:22:25.260 --> 2:22:27.260]  How did Nancy Pelosi get all of her money?
[2:22:27.260 --> 2:22:31.260]  By the way they just said, which is totally illegal
[2:22:31.260 --> 2:22:34.260]  But they just said that they're going to release all of
[2:22:34.260 --> 2:22:39.260]  The Congress Democrats and Congress just said no the IRS can release Donald Trump's tax returns
[2:22:39.260 --> 2:22:41.260]  Okay so what?
[2:22:41.260 --> 2:22:44.260]  Go ahead release his tax returns show us how much money he made or he lost
[2:22:44.260 --> 2:22:46.260]  Nobody gives a damn
[2:22:46.260 --> 2:22:49.260]  But see it just shows you that they're totally unhinged at this point
[2:22:49.260 --> 2:22:52.260]  I'd like to see Nancy Pelosi's tax returns
[2:22:52.260 --> 2:22:58.260]  I'd like to know how Nancy Pelosi became worth hundreds of millions of dollars
[2:22:58.260 --> 2:23:06.260]  On her senate salary which is I think like $180,000 a year
[2:23:06.260 --> 2:23:10.260]  Nancy let's see your tax returns from the last 30 years
[2:23:10.260 --> 2:23:13.260]  Or how long has she been in government? 50 years?
[2:23:13.260 --> 2:23:17.260]  Let's see that old bag's tax returns
[2:23:17.260 --> 2:23:22.260]  Let's see that demonic meat bag Nancy Pelosi's tax returns
[2:23:22.260 --> 2:23:24.260]  Wonder what that would look like
[2:23:24.260 --> 2:23:27.260]  We know how Donald Trump made his money
[2:23:27.260 --> 2:23:30.260]  We know what Donald Trump's been up to over the years
[2:23:30.260 --> 2:23:32.260]  It's been a very public figure
[2:23:32.260 --> 2:23:34.260]  Now what about you Nancy?
[2:23:34.260 --> 2:23:37.260]  I'd like to see Nancy Pelosi's tax returns
[2:23:37.260 --> 2:23:39.260]  And for that matter maybe Chuck Schumer's too
[2:23:39.260 --> 2:23:42.260]  Maybe Diane Feinstein's, maybe Maxine Waters
[2:23:42.260 --> 2:23:45.260]  Maybe aside for the Democrats to get a little taste of their own medicine
[2:23:45.260 --> 2:23:49.260]  Oh you don't think there's financial crimes in every single one of the Democrats I mentioned
[2:23:49.260 --> 2:23:51.260]  They could probably put them in jail?
[2:23:51.260 --> 2:23:53.260]  Somebody do the investigation
[2:23:53.260 --> 2:23:57.260]  Your voice counts
[2:23:57.260 --> 2:24:01.260]  When you share information be it over the internet or in person

[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:03.660]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems including

[2:26:08.780 --> 2:26:09.780]  system.

[2:27:54.020 --> 2:28:06.380]  You're listening to the ALIX Jones show.
[2:28:06.380 --> 2:28:10.900]  Happening right now, we're seeing a violation of Governor Abbott's executive order that
[2:28:10.900 --> 2:28:16.060]  prohibits anyone other than law enforcement being able to transport migrants.
[2:28:16.060 --> 2:28:21.220]  Yesterday we saw this happening, many taxi drivers coming up, Uber drivers coming up.
[2:28:21.220 --> 2:28:26.100]  Well today it's business as usual, even though Governor Abbott has just issued this executive
[2:28:26.100 --> 2:28:33.300]  order that prohibits anyone else besides law enforcement officers to transport any undocumented
[2:28:33.300 --> 2:28:34.300]  immigrants.
[2:28:34.300 --> 2:28:37.100]  You can see behind me, there's taxi vehicles over there.
[2:28:37.100 --> 2:28:41.940]  We caught some other Uber drivers continuing to pick up the undocumented immigrants.
[2:28:41.940 --> 2:28:46.980]  This was all put in place because of the rising number of COVID-19 cases in Texas.
[2:28:46.980 --> 2:28:54.180]  New COVID cases in Texas have spiked 178 percent over the last two weeks and hospitalizations
[2:28:54.180 --> 2:28:58.540]  have risen by more than 80 percent, that's according to the Daily Mail.
[2:28:58.540 --> 2:29:02.380]  I have a job to protect the safety and health of the people of the state of Texas and that
[2:29:02.380 --> 2:29:09.300]  includes, especially now, preventing President Biden from importing COVID-19 into Texas as
[2:29:09.300 --> 2:29:11.980]  well as into the United States.
[2:29:11.980 --> 2:29:16.940]  Governor Abbott is also accusing the Biden administration of thwarting Title 42 that
[2:29:16.940 --> 2:29:21.300]  was put in place under the Trump administration.
[2:29:21.300 --> 2:29:27.700]  And what Title 42 allows for is border officials to turn migrants away at the border regardless
[2:29:27.700 --> 2:29:32.220]  of asylum status in order to curb these COVID-19 cases.
[2:29:32.220 --> 2:29:37.940]  So again, happening right now, a violation of Governor Abbott's executive order that
[2:29:37.940 --> 2:29:42.460]  only law enforcement officials are supposed to be transporting migrants.
[2:29:42.460 --> 2:29:47.380]  Reporting from Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, I'm Christy Lee.
[2:29:47.380 --> 2:29:49.900]  And Christy Lee is in studio with us now.
[2:29:49.900 --> 2:29:55.420]  She is the host of KLTV and we've also got her a channel on banned out video because her
[2:29:55.420 --> 2:29:58.820]  work is getting censored and so we're appreciative of her being in studio.
[2:29:58.820 --> 2:30:03.220]  You were just down at the southern border and it was right on the edges of Governor Abbott
[2:30:03.220 --> 2:30:07.220]  saying, we're going to try to take law enforcement into our own hands down here.
[2:30:07.220 --> 2:30:09.860]  It's obviously been for the most part lawless down there.
[2:30:09.860 --> 2:30:14.540]  You were covering the fact that the La Jolla sheriff came out and said, well, we didn't
[2:30:14.540 --> 2:30:17.780]  know that they were putting illegal immigrants in hotels.
[2:30:17.780 --> 2:30:18.860]  So you were just down there.
[2:30:18.860 --> 2:30:20.020]  You spent a couple days down there.
[2:30:20.020 --> 2:30:22.140]  You were going scoping out all the scenes.
[2:30:22.140 --> 2:30:24.620]  What do you want to report to the American people about what you saw down there?
[2:30:24.620 --> 2:30:28.100]  Well, I want to say that this is the very first time that I've been to the southern
[2:30:28.100 --> 2:30:29.100]  border.
[2:30:29.100 --> 2:30:32.220]  So it was a little bit shocking having seen it for the first time.
[2:30:32.220 --> 2:30:37.820]  And I do have conflicting emotions as hard as a mother to go to be outside of Catholic
[2:30:37.820 --> 2:30:43.580]  charities and see the flood of people being taken and buses dropped off there.
[2:30:43.580 --> 2:30:49.980]  You see so many women that are pregnant, so many babies and children, some only with a
[2:30:49.980 --> 2:30:51.100]  diaper on.
[2:30:51.100 --> 2:30:55.620]  So of course, as a mother, it's hard to see that and you want to help them and you want
[2:30:55.620 --> 2:30:56.620]  to care for them.
[2:30:56.620 --> 2:31:00.580]  But you also see so many sketchy things and I know you've been to the border as well
[2:31:00.580 --> 2:31:03.860]  that just make you have an unsettled spirit.
[2:31:03.860 --> 2:31:09.980]  I mean, for example, there was a man with a shirt off, tattoos everywhere, and he was
[2:31:09.980 --> 2:31:14.340]  there outside of Catholic charity saying he was there to make a pickup.
[2:31:14.340 --> 2:31:19.820]  And I'm thinking, again, as a mother, like, what is this guy doing coming to pick up anyone?
[2:31:19.820 --> 2:31:20.820]  Well, that's what I was going to say.
[2:31:20.820 --> 2:31:21.820]  I mean, the motherly instincts.
[2:31:21.820 --> 2:31:22.820]  I'm from Minnesota.
[2:31:22.820 --> 2:31:25.740]  I'm like, why is a man from Minnesota coming to pick up any migrants?
[2:31:25.740 --> 2:31:27.220]  And he doesn't even have a shirt on.
[2:31:27.220 --> 2:31:30.180]  And like you said, it's the motherly instincts, but it goes both ways.
[2:31:30.180 --> 2:31:34.100]  I mean, you want to make sure that the children are taken care of and you see the pregnant
[2:31:34.100 --> 2:31:35.100]  mothers and everything.
[2:31:35.100 --> 2:31:38.340]  But then there's another aspect of it where it's like, you also have instincts to tell
[2:31:38.340 --> 2:31:40.820]  your kids, don't get in the car with a stranger.
[2:31:40.820 --> 2:31:41.820]  Right.
[2:31:41.820 --> 2:31:45.540]  And that's where the conflicting emotions come in because as a mother, I'm seeing this
[2:31:45.540 --> 2:31:49.180]  and you just want to like wrap these people up in your arms and take care of them.
[2:31:49.180 --> 2:31:55.100]  But at the same time, my other mother in motherly instinct is telling me, you know, they're
[2:31:55.100 --> 2:31:58.780]  just dumping them out on the streets after they test positive for COVID.
[2:31:58.780 --> 2:32:01.940]  That's why they ended up at a wad of burger coughing, sneezing everywhere.
[2:32:01.940 --> 2:32:06.980]  So the people in that community are put at risk and no big deal is made out of that.
[2:32:06.980 --> 2:32:08.900]  We're barely hearing about that.
[2:32:08.900 --> 2:32:11.860]  Just mainstream has continued to disappoint me.
[2:32:11.860 --> 2:32:15.900]  You know that I came from mainstream news and I just don't understand being there at
[2:32:15.900 --> 2:32:21.140]  the border and having all of this new information come out and being the only one there, looking
[2:32:21.140 --> 2:32:23.140]  around and no one else is covering it.
[2:32:23.140 --> 2:32:27.740]  Well, and that's part of the thing is they want to tug at our emotional heartstrings because
[2:32:27.740 --> 2:32:32.460]  nobody wants to be a jerk that says, Hey, you know, screw those kids, screw those people.
[2:32:32.460 --> 2:32:36.380]  They can go back where they came from, even though there's an element of that.
[2:32:36.380 --> 2:32:40.060]  But you know, they come here and they're told they're going to have everything taken care
[2:32:40.060 --> 2:32:41.060]  of.
[2:32:41.060 --> 2:32:45.540]  They're given these manila envelopes that have prepaid debit cards, airline tickets,
[2:32:45.540 --> 2:32:47.020]  bus tickets, everything.
[2:32:47.020 --> 2:32:48.860]  But sometimes they show up.
[2:32:48.860 --> 2:32:52.860]  They get dropped off by Border Patrol in the middle of McAllen and they don't even know
[2:32:52.860 --> 2:32:53.860]  what to do.
[2:32:53.860 --> 2:32:56.100]  And so they just end up wandering into a water burger.
[2:32:56.100 --> 2:32:57.100]  Exactly.
[2:32:57.100 --> 2:33:00.100]  I mean, and that's what we had confirmed by La Jolla police.
[2:33:00.100 --> 2:33:05.060]  We saw that, that they, they found out that Catholic Charities had just booked up a bunch
[2:33:05.060 --> 2:33:09.540]  of hotels, put them in this an area hotel, but then no tracking is being done after that.
[2:33:09.540 --> 2:33:11.060]  That's how they ended up in a water burger.
[2:33:11.060 --> 2:33:14.020]  It's just, you know, a hop, skipping a jump from that hotel.
[2:33:14.020 --> 2:33:15.460]  They were able to walk there.
[2:33:15.460 --> 2:33:20.780]  No one's monitoring the very people that they've tested positive for COVID-19 yet were pushing
[2:33:20.780 --> 2:33:22.540]  out into the mainstream media.
[2:33:22.540 --> 2:33:27.180]  Oh, this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated flipping out about over that boat.
[2:33:27.180 --> 2:33:32.500]  Why are we not talking about this crisis of thousands of people coming in?
[2:33:32.500 --> 2:33:38.500]  We have spiked in cases of COVID-19 and it can be traced back to those testing positive
[2:33:38.500 --> 2:33:43.380]  that are coming in from outside our borders and just free to roam and getting picked
[2:33:43.380 --> 2:33:48.180]  up by random people from Minnesota saying, I'm just here to do business.
[2:33:48.180 --> 2:33:52.740]  We just deserve answers and more transparency and that's what I'd like to see transparency
[2:33:52.740 --> 2:33:53.740]  and accountability.
[2:33:53.740 --> 2:33:58.100]  So you were down there for a couple of days kind of observing the scenes, doing your reports
[2:33:58.100 --> 2:33:59.220]  for KLTV.
[2:33:59.220 --> 2:34:02.420]  We have your channel featured at Band Out Video now as well.
[2:34:02.420 --> 2:34:04.540]  What do you think really stuck out to you?
[2:34:04.540 --> 2:34:05.540]  What did you notice?
[2:34:05.540 --> 2:34:07.340]  Like you said, some sketchy stuff.
[2:34:07.340 --> 2:34:11.980]  What stuck out at you just from observing the scenes down there on that hot corner?
[2:34:11.980 --> 2:34:17.020]  I think the biggest thing is what I, what I said, Uber drivers and taxi drivers picking
[2:34:17.020 --> 2:34:20.180]  up migrants and taking them where?
[2:34:20.180 --> 2:34:24.740]  The one Uber driver I spoke with said, yeah, it's just a mess out here.
[2:34:24.740 --> 2:34:29.260]  I come here every day and I, it was taking some to the Laredo airport.
[2:34:29.260 --> 2:34:30.740]  They missed their flight.
[2:34:30.740 --> 2:34:34.380]  And so then I had to take them to another airport, you know, and I was only able to
[2:34:34.380 --> 2:34:39.980]  talk to him momentarily because then the other volunteers come in and, but, but why are they,
[2:34:39.980 --> 2:34:40.980]  where are they taking them?
[2:34:40.980 --> 2:34:42.700]  Why, to so many airports?
[2:34:42.700 --> 2:34:49.660]  There's just so many unanswered questions and not enough is not enough of a spotlight
[2:34:49.660 --> 2:34:52.100]  is put on this as an issue.
[2:34:52.100 --> 2:34:53.100]  And, and why?
[2:34:53.100 --> 2:34:58.660]  Well, and when I was down there, I think for the four or five trips and multiple day trips
[2:34:58.660 --> 2:35:03.460]  that I went down there, I only saw another media crew once, one time.
[2:35:03.460 --> 2:35:06.020]  And that was just a guy with a tripod who was setting up to get some b-roll.
[2:35:06.020 --> 2:35:07.220]  He was there for maybe five minutes.
[2:35:07.220 --> 2:35:09.540]  I think he told us he was with French television.
[2:35:09.540 --> 2:35:13.940]  Well, now this should be a big story, there should be local news everywhere.
[2:35:13.940 --> 2:35:16.580]  Governor Abbott saying, Hey, we're going to try to have our own law enforcement.
[2:35:16.580 --> 2:35:18.580]  We're going to stop this influx of illegal immigration.
[2:35:18.580 --> 2:35:22.540]  We're going to stop this, you know, groups of people testing positive from COVID from
[2:35:22.540 --> 2:35:23.940]  coming into the country.
[2:35:23.940 --> 2:35:28.180]  Did you see any other media while you were down there as that announcement was made?
[2:35:28.180 --> 2:35:32.540]  Like I said, that's what's so shocking about it is I didn't see anybody right on the corner
[2:35:32.540 --> 2:35:36.300]  there where we should be asking what's going on.
[2:35:36.300 --> 2:35:41.580]  You are the lawyer, police department is accusing you Catholic Charities of dumping COVID-19
[2:35:41.580 --> 2:35:44.500]  positive people out into the community to put others at risk.
[2:35:44.500 --> 2:35:46.580]  What, what do you have to say about that?
[2:35:46.580 --> 2:35:50.220]  Why wouldn't any reporters be out there asking these same questions?
[2:35:50.220 --> 2:35:51.940]  Why isn't more attention put?
[2:35:51.940 --> 2:35:54.580]  But again, my heart goes out to the whole situation.
[2:35:54.580 --> 2:35:56.180]  It's a conflicting emotions.
[2:35:56.180 --> 2:36:01.340]  I have compassion, but I can't help, but when I'm looking at these buses of people being
[2:36:01.340 --> 2:36:06.540]  dropped off just looking at everyone with some skepticism because it's like, are those
[2:36:06.540 --> 2:36:11.620]  really that child's parents, you know, I mean, we know this happens.
[2:36:11.620 --> 2:36:14.140]  It could be happening in plain sight.
[2:36:14.140 --> 2:36:16.220]  How do we get to the bottom of this, this problem?
[2:36:16.220 --> 2:36:17.220]  We know it occurs.
[2:36:17.220 --> 2:36:22.660]  Well, and imagine too, if you were a criminal who wanted to smuggle children into the country
[2:36:22.660 --> 2:36:29.220]  for whatever reason to put them in a sex trafficking operation or just using them as your get into
[2:36:29.220 --> 2:36:30.580]  the country free card.
[2:36:30.580 --> 2:36:32.060]  You know that both of those things happen.
[2:36:32.060 --> 2:36:34.860]  Well, this is the perfect scenario to do it.
[2:36:34.860 --> 2:36:40.940]  If even if 90%, 95%, let's say that those are their actual mothers, what of the 5%?
[2:36:40.940 --> 2:36:43.860]  I think that's probably a low number to say that that could be the case.
[2:36:43.860 --> 2:36:49.060]  But wow, oh, I've got bus loads and bus loads of children and mothers coming in and guess
[2:36:49.060 --> 2:36:53.940]  what, I can easily sneak a child in with not a mother, sneak a child in with not the father
[2:36:53.940 --> 2:36:55.260]  and nobody would ever know.
[2:36:55.260 --> 2:36:56.780]  We know what happens.
[2:36:56.780 --> 2:37:01.780]  It's probably happening right in front of our faces, but again, I'm just disappointed
[2:37:01.780 --> 2:37:03.940]  being there at Catholic Charities.
[2:37:03.940 --> 2:37:05.780]  You see all these volunteers.
[2:37:05.780 --> 2:37:09.820]  You want to assume that they have good motivations.
[2:37:09.820 --> 2:37:15.420]  Why don't they feel uncomfortable with a shirtless man, bunch of tattoos everywhere there to pick
[2:37:15.420 --> 2:37:17.860]  up migrants coming all the way from Minnesota?
[2:37:17.860 --> 2:37:23.060]  I mean, are they asking more questions or they're just like, okay, here you go.
[2:37:23.060 --> 2:37:24.620]  That unsettles my spirit.
[2:37:24.620 --> 2:37:25.620]  I want to know more.
[2:37:25.620 --> 2:37:27.320]  I want to know what's happening.
[2:37:27.320 --> 2:37:30.300]  When we come back from this break, I want to ask you if there was any cooperation because
[2:37:30.300 --> 2:37:34.020]  every time we go down there, they don't really like us much.
[2:37:34.020 --> 2:37:35.980]  They make sure nobody can see inside.
[2:37:35.980 --> 2:37:37.380]  They never want to answer questions.
[2:37:37.380 --> 2:37:40.900]  I mean, at one point I was trying to be cordial with them and just be like, hey, can we get
[2:37:40.900 --> 2:37:41.900]  an interview?
[2:37:41.900 --> 2:37:43.660]  Can I talk to some of these people?
[2:37:43.660 --> 2:37:47.180]  And once they realize that, hey, you're reporting that they're running an illegal immigration
[2:37:47.180 --> 2:37:50.180]  pipeline, they shut you out, they block the doors.
[2:37:50.180 --> 2:37:52.020]  And so I want to ask if you had that same experience.
[2:37:52.020 --> 2:37:53.020]  We'll be right back.
[2:37:53.020 --> 2:37:57.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Schreuer here, the host of the InfoWars War Room, and I am very
[2:37:57.140 --> 2:38:01.780]  excited about our latest supplement addition to InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:38:01.780 --> 2:38:07.100]  Now, I've been supplementing with greens, fibers, and vegetable capsules for a long time.
[2:38:07.100 --> 2:38:12.700]  And so I was excited to hear that we were adding our own greens fiber caps to InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:38:12.700 --> 2:38:15.780]  But then I read the ingredients and I was blown away.
[2:38:15.780 --> 2:38:17.060]  Listen to this.
[2:38:17.060 --> 2:38:22.620]  Organic pea fiber, organic alfalfa leaf, organic wheatgrass leaf, organic cilantro leaf, organic
[2:38:22.620 --> 2:38:27.060]  kale leaf, organic flax sprout, organic quinoa sprout.
[2:38:27.060 --> 2:38:30.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, all of these things are so incredible for your health.
[2:38:30.460 --> 2:38:34.220]  Just one of these ingredients can be a life-changing supplement for your health.
[2:38:34.220 --> 2:38:38.960]  And we've packed it all in to fibergreencaps at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:38:38.960 --> 2:38:42.740]  So I'm excited to add this to my supplement routine every day.
[2:38:42.740 --> 2:38:45.060]  I suggest that you do the same thing.
[2:38:45.060 --> 2:38:49.340]  And right now, it's at an introductory price of $19.95.
[2:38:49.340 --> 2:38:54.700]  It's 33% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:38:54.700 --> 2:39:01.900]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, that it's
[2:39:01.900 --> 2:39:05.060]  criminals are extremely pathological.
[2:39:05.060 --> 2:39:08.460]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again.
[2:39:08.460 --> 2:39:13.380]  And criminals like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[2:39:13.380 --> 2:39:20.900]  You'll guess what, it was Anthony Fauci, a eugenicist's globalist that ran the rollout
[2:39:20.900 --> 2:39:25.220]  of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more
[2:39:25.220 --> 2:39:26.220]  people than HIV.
[2:39:26.220 --> 2:39:31.620]  And they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually go attack the
[2:39:31.620 --> 2:39:35.580]  t-limbs besides the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[2:39:35.580 --> 2:39:40.900]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down
[2:39:40.900 --> 2:39:41.900]  the road.
[2:39:41.900 --> 2:39:46.020]  And that's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine because now they admit the
[2:39:46.020 --> 2:39:51.340]  COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[2:39:51.340 --> 2:39:54.780]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:39:54.780 --> 2:39:59.100]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers
[2:39:59.100 --> 2:40:03.100]  controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do.
[2:40:03.100 --> 2:40:07.100]  But because they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate,
[2:40:07.100 --> 2:40:11.860]  I still have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire has a lot of power.
[2:40:11.860 --> 2:40:16.860]  But when I'm not using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket
[2:40:16.860 --> 2:40:18.740]  at infowarstore.com.
[2:40:18.740 --> 2:40:23.020]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated, they fit almost all types of androids

[2:40:46.740 --> 2:40:49.660]  It's a great way to spend more time with your family and it's a great way to know you're
[2:40:49.660 --> 2:40:52.020]  not being tracked by the criminal global system.

[2:40:55.380 --> 2:41:00.140]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that
[2:41:00.140 --> 2:41:01.460]  I've ever done.

[2:41:05.860 --> 2:41:09.060]  in my efforts to bring the truth forward.
[2:41:09.060 --> 2:41:11.100]  Well it's all come down to this.
[2:41:11.100 --> 2:41:16.860]  I'm having a cyber symposium on August 10th, 11th and 12th.

[2:41:53.380 --> 2:41:57.340]  ALIX.
[2:41:57.340 --> 2:42:10.300]  We're listening to the ALIX Jones show.
[2:42:10.300 --> 2:42:13.180]  Kristi Lee from KLTV is with us.
[2:42:13.180 --> 2:42:17.260]  She decided she wanted to become an independent journalist because mainstream media holds
[2:42:17.260 --> 2:42:18.260]  back the truth.
[2:42:18.260 --> 2:42:23.860]  She's got a channel now at band.video and she's sitting in studio with me and so we're
[2:42:23.860 --> 2:42:28.060]  talking to her about her trip down to the border, it was her first trip down there, big news
[2:42:28.060 --> 2:42:30.980]  governor of Texas saying hey we're going to actually have law enforcement down there
[2:42:30.980 --> 2:42:36.060]  arresting illegal immigrants so you'd think there'd be other media down there reporting
[2:42:36.060 --> 2:42:40.380]  on this covering this and it's not like this thing where a lot of other media places will
[2:42:40.380 --> 2:42:41.380]  be happy.
[2:42:41.380 --> 2:42:42.380]  Oh we got the exclusive.
[2:42:42.380 --> 2:42:43.860]  I'm down there nobody else has this.
[2:42:43.860 --> 2:42:44.860]  No, no, no.
[2:42:44.860 --> 2:42:48.260]  I mean personally I wish there were other people down there breaking the story wide open so
[2:42:48.260 --> 2:42:52.420]  that Kristi Lee didn't have to bear all the burden but you were down there.
[2:42:52.420 --> 2:42:56.420]  So talk about you're an experienced journalist, you're trying to do investigative journalism
[2:42:56.420 --> 2:42:57.420]  down there.
[2:42:57.420 --> 2:43:01.780]  Did you get any cooperation from the Catholic Charities, did you get any cooperation from
[2:43:01.780 --> 2:43:04.940]  whatever law enforcement was down there when you started asking questions?
[2:43:04.940 --> 2:43:06.500]  Yes and no.
[2:43:06.500 --> 2:43:13.140]  So I texted the Sergeant of the La Jolla Police Department, I never got a response back.
[2:43:13.140 --> 2:43:18.220]  I reached out to Judge Cortez, didn't get a response back.
[2:43:18.220 --> 2:43:24.580]  Now when I was out there I did ask Sister Norma for the Executive Director of Catholic
[2:43:24.580 --> 2:43:27.020]  Charities for an interview and she nodded yes.
[2:43:27.020 --> 2:43:29.980]  She was leading like some kind of a tour, I wasn't sure.
[2:43:29.980 --> 2:43:35.500]  So she nodded yes and continued on with her tour and then when she went in and as she
[2:43:35.500 --> 2:43:38.780]  was closing the door I'm like you're still coming out to do an interview you know and
[2:43:38.780 --> 2:43:41.420]  So wait hold on, a tour though, what do you mean a tour?
[2:43:41.420 --> 2:43:42.420]  I really don't know.
[2:43:42.420 --> 2:43:44.420]  Who am I supposed to find that out from?
[2:43:44.420 --> 2:43:49.860]  It was a group of people that she was leading and showing the facilities to, it might have
[2:43:49.860 --> 2:43:54.540]  been, it might have been like extra volunteers perhaps, I'm not sure.
[2:43:54.540 --> 2:43:59.700]  Or maybe people she wants for funding but of course see oh she's going to go do a tour
[2:43:59.700 --> 2:44:03.340]  of the facility but the journalist isn't allowed in.
[2:44:03.340 --> 2:44:05.940]  Can I join this group maybe?
[2:44:05.940 --> 2:44:11.460]  So I mean in good faith I wanted to get a good decent interview from the Executive Director
[2:44:11.460 --> 2:44:16.420]  of Catholic Charities, the reason I went independent internalism is I felt like I wasn't getting
[2:44:16.420 --> 2:44:22.980]  to report both sides so of course I want both sides and I want to do it fairly but if they,
[2:44:22.980 --> 2:44:26.580]  if I get a roadblock and they just simply won't talk to me what am I supposed to do
[2:44:26.580 --> 2:44:27.580]  with that?
[2:44:27.580 --> 2:44:29.900]  But I, it had good faith that she was going to come out.
[2:44:29.900 --> 2:44:33.980]  We, I waited for two hours, she poked her head out again and she said she was going
[2:44:33.980 --> 2:44:39.900]  to come back, never came back, then it started raining and so then I contacted her assistant,
[2:44:39.900 --> 2:44:44.860]  we had a Zoom interview set up and apparently a meeting came up so I mean if she does still
[2:44:44.860 --> 2:44:48.660]  want to talk to me I still want to talk to her, I still want to ask these questions and
[2:44:48.660 --> 2:44:54.620]  get this side but again going independent it's just like you, you want to do both sides
[2:44:54.620 --> 2:44:59.700]  but it's like you get a roadblock sometimes so I'm not sure.
[2:44:59.700 --> 2:45:04.500]  Well and you don't want to sit here and you know talk disparagingly about a sister, about
[2:45:04.500 --> 2:45:05.500]  a nun.
[2:45:05.500 --> 2:45:06.500]  You know these are supposed to be some of-
[2:45:06.500 --> 2:45:10.660]  And a sister says yes, I'm coming back out and talking to you, you don't want to think
[2:45:10.660 --> 2:45:11.660]  she's lying.
[2:45:11.660 --> 2:45:16.900]  But what does that say, I mean it's almost a kind of a very revealing thing that here's
[2:45:16.900 --> 2:45:20.540]  this sister, here's this nun running this illegal immigration facility, hiding from
[2:45:20.540 --> 2:45:25.460]  the media and it's not even good for her word, not even good for her word, I mean that should
[2:45:25.460 --> 2:45:28.220]  be the easiest thing to be good on.
[2:45:28.220 --> 2:45:32.740]  You would hope, again I like to give the benefit of the doubt maybe something came up but like
[2:45:32.740 --> 2:45:37.060]  I waited out there for two hours, I mean someone could have given me an update that she wasn't
[2:45:37.060 --> 2:45:41.740]  going to come back out and talk after all but again I mean I would still love to talk
[2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:45.140]  to her if she gets around to it.
[2:45:45.140 --> 2:45:48.500]  So you were down there and I was actually, you know because I was asking you of all the
[2:45:48.500 --> 2:45:53.460]  times I've been down there, it's just non-stop buses, non-stop cars, non-stop the pipeline
[2:45:53.460 --> 2:45:58.380]  just continues to the airport, to the facility, to the, you know it's just non-stop and you're
[2:45:58.380 --> 2:46:02.700]  saying for the two days you were down there it basically, it just hasn't stopped, it just
[2:46:02.700 --> 2:46:05.620]  continues no matter even with the executive order.
[2:46:05.620 --> 2:46:09.500]  It's overwhelming to see for the very first time, this was my first time out there and
[2:46:09.500 --> 2:46:14.940]  just to see busload after busload and lines going through and it's uncomfortably like
[2:46:14.940 --> 2:46:21.980]  leading cattle lines and to see again as a mother like babies and diapers and then just
[2:46:21.980 --> 2:46:27.260]  the skepticism of like are they really with their families, who is this person, why is
[2:46:27.260 --> 2:46:32.900]  this person from Minnesota coming to pick up these kids and it's just, it's icky, it
[2:46:32.900 --> 2:46:33.900]  feels icky.
[2:46:33.900 --> 2:46:36.900]  Well I think that's your instinct though, icky.
[2:46:36.900 --> 2:46:42.100]  I mean that's just an instinctual thing, you're sitting there for hours and the pipeline
[2:46:42.100 --> 2:46:48.220]  just never stops, you know, I mean this isn't a secret that illegal immigration is a hot
[2:46:48.220 --> 2:46:53.260]  bed for all kinds of criminal activity whether it's smuggling humans, sex trafficking humans,
[2:46:53.260 --> 2:46:57.820]  bringing in drugs, bringing in guns and you're just watching it in mass happen right in front
[2:46:57.820 --> 2:47:03.140]  of you and I think perhaps the most shocking element of this, you're there and this is
[2:47:03.140 --> 2:47:09.260]  just one facility, this is just one facility of dozens if not hundreds just like it across
[2:47:09.260 --> 2:47:11.620]  the entire southern border.
[2:47:11.620 --> 2:47:17.020]  And I know that news came out today of another mayor in a different part of the city calling
[2:47:17.020 --> 2:47:20.340]  out Catholic Charities for doing the same thing in their area, I don't have that information
[2:47:20.340 --> 2:47:23.420]  right in front of me right now but I'm sure we'll be reporting on that later.
[2:47:23.420 --> 2:47:26.020]  And it's just happening in one area.
[2:47:26.020 --> 2:47:30.860]  And it's so frustrating too because you were talking about the Sheriff's Department in
[2:47:30.860 --> 2:47:34.740]  La Jolla and other police departments have basically now echoed the same thing where
[2:47:34.740 --> 2:47:39.620]  he says, hey, we had no idea that they were putting illegal immigrants with COVID in these
[2:47:39.620 --> 2:47:45.660]  hotels and I was down there in, I can't even, I lost track of time but the guys I'm sure
[2:47:45.660 --> 2:47:50.260]  have the videos up there, I guess we were down there in February and in March and I
[2:47:50.260 --> 2:47:54.180]  went to at least seven different hotels just because I was following the buses as they
[2:47:54.180 --> 2:47:58.940]  were leaving just doing journalistic work and we'd follow the bus and it'd go to this
[2:47:58.940 --> 2:48:02.660]  hotel and I'd walk in and I'd ask the person at the front desk what's going on here and
[2:48:02.660 --> 2:48:06.700]  they'd say, these are COVID positive immigrants, okay, we went back to the facility, we followed
[2:48:06.700 --> 2:48:11.180]  the next bus, they went to a different hotel, we did it over and over about seven or eight
[2:48:11.180 --> 2:48:16.220]  times and it was the same story every time they were taking the COVID positive patients
[2:48:16.220 --> 2:48:19.700]  and they were keeping them in these hotels released from custody as they could leave
[2:48:19.700 --> 2:48:24.980]  if they want, nobody's keeping in there, some of them do actually end up leaving and it's
[2:48:24.980 --> 2:48:30.700]  just like, wait a second, how can I be reporting that story months ago and now here we are
[2:48:30.700 --> 2:48:35.260]  in mid-summer and sheriff's departments are saying they had no idea it was going on.
[2:48:35.260 --> 2:48:36.260]  How is that even possible?
[2:48:36.260 --> 2:48:41.020]  I'm not sure but you did mention something that we haven't talked about is their ability
[2:48:41.020 --> 2:48:46.540]  to be here and that's the I-35, that's what the family said that was found in the Whataburger
[2:48:46.540 --> 2:48:51.180]  that had been coughing and sneezing when the officer asked what they were doing, what was
[2:48:51.180 --> 2:48:55.340]  going on, they admitted they were COVID positive but that they had crossed the river but they
[2:48:55.340 --> 2:48:57.980]  were here legally because they had an I-35.
[2:48:57.980 --> 2:49:04.220]  Now the La Jolla sergeant says that allows them to be here for 60 days but they need
[2:49:04.220 --> 2:49:08.820]  to report to the nearest ice facility when they reach their destination, whatever that
[2:49:08.820 --> 2:49:10.380]  means exactly.
[2:49:10.380 --> 2:49:17.660]  But an Axos report I read says that of everyone that actually reports within those 60 days,
[2:49:17.660 --> 2:49:22.060]  more than double do not and so what's being done about that?
[2:49:22.060 --> 2:49:25.220]  What motivation do they have to, I mean of course they're given the threat that they'll
[2:49:25.220 --> 2:49:27.580]  be like sent back if they don't report but.
[2:49:27.580 --> 2:49:34.140]  Well and it used to be some of them would, they'd put the ankle monitor on them then
[2:49:34.140 --> 2:49:38.300]  they said okay we don't have enough ankle monitors obviously so then they were only
[2:49:38.300 --> 2:49:43.580]  putting the ankle monitors on violent criminals, you know rapists or even murderers that would
[2:49:43.580 --> 2:49:46.620]  come across the southern border, yeah they'd be let in but they'd put an ankle bracelet
[2:49:46.620 --> 2:49:47.620]  on them.
[2:49:47.620 --> 2:49:48.620]  Now they don't even do that.
[2:49:48.620 --> 2:49:52.580]  Now if you can get across and you, if you're lucky you test positive for COVID because
[2:49:52.580 --> 2:49:56.140]  that's your release card, that means you're totally released and it's just incredible.
[2:49:56.140 --> 2:50:00.260]  Again folks I don't know why nobody else wants to cover this big bombshell story, I don't
[2:50:00.260 --> 2:50:04.020]  know why anybody else isn't sending crews to the border, it's like the easiest thing
[2:50:04.020 --> 2:50:07.540]  ever, you stand on the street corner for an hour, two hours and you'll see a thousand
[2:50:07.540 --> 2:50:11.500]  illegal immigrants coming in, you'll see the bus loads coming in, you'll see the Catholic
[2:50:11.500 --> 2:50:15.580]  Charities running the whole thing, they're now expanding their operation to like seven
[2:50:15.580 --> 2:50:19.540]  city blocks in downtown McAllen Texas, it's just wild.
[2:50:19.540 --> 2:50:22.140]  So you've been reporting on that, I know you've been reporting on some other things right
[2:50:22.140 --> 2:50:26.100]  now, we've just put your channel KLTV up on Band Out Video.
[2:50:26.100 --> 2:50:30.860]  What else are you reporting on, what are you going to be reporting on in the near future?
[2:50:30.860 --> 2:50:35.900]  Basically I'm just letting Jesus lead me to what he wants me to report about.
[2:50:35.900 --> 2:50:41.660]  I am going through this growth period I guess you could say because I've been in mainstream
[2:50:41.660 --> 2:50:48.900]  news for so long, 20 years total, about 15 years in TV news and then half that as a main
[2:50:48.900 --> 2:50:49.900]  evening news anchor.
[2:50:49.900 --> 2:50:54.740]  So I'm trained to do things a certain way and now I'm kind of having to leave that behind
[2:50:54.740 --> 2:50:58.540]  and find my voice and figure out what needs to be heard.
[2:50:58.540 --> 2:51:03.580]  But that's my passion of it, that's why ultimately the straw that broke the camel's back is just
[2:51:03.580 --> 2:51:08.020]  all of the censorship and I didn't feel like both sides were being reported fairly, so
[2:51:08.020 --> 2:51:10.060]  I'm trying to do that.
[2:51:10.060 --> 2:51:16.140]  Yeah, you've had a lot of experience, what would you say just in general is the state
[2:51:16.140 --> 2:51:20.820]  of news right now, the state of mainstream media right now?
[2:51:20.820 --> 2:51:26.340]  I think it's dying and I think that they're faced with the fact that they're dying and
[2:51:26.340 --> 2:51:33.140]  so it becomes a process of where it just gets worse because as they're losing add dollars
[2:51:33.140 --> 2:51:39.020]  because they're becoming less relevant, well then they have to appease and their advertisers
[2:51:39.020 --> 2:51:45.300]  even more to get that money and so it just becomes this cycle of just getting worse and
[2:51:45.300 --> 2:51:48.260]  worse and it just can't go on forever.
[2:51:48.260 --> 2:51:54.620]  I feel like especially TV news is dying and people have other sources of information and
[2:51:54.620 --> 2:51:59.620]  they're going, people want the truth, they're going to seek it and find it and I think people's
[2:51:59.620 --> 2:52:07.540]  eyes are opening to that this news that you're seeing is so influenced by advertisers and
[2:52:07.540 --> 2:52:12.380]  corporations that how can you, is it a commercial or is it news?
[2:52:12.380 --> 2:52:17.500]  I mean that's what it ends up coming down to, I mean it really comes down to is it propaganda
[2:52:17.500 --> 2:52:18.900]  or is it information?
[2:52:18.900 --> 2:52:21.380]  Do you get to decide what the truth is?
[2:52:21.380 --> 2:52:26.860]  Do you get to evaluate the information you're given and what people are saying or is it
[2:52:26.860 --> 2:52:34.740]  decided for you before you even get to evaluate it because news has deemed itself the authority
[2:52:34.740 --> 2:52:35.740]  of information.
[2:52:35.740 --> 2:52:36.740]  It's frustrating.
[2:52:36.740 --> 2:52:42.300]  Very well said and it's been, that exact thing has been illustrated by Project Whistleblowers,
[2:52:42.300 --> 2:52:44.300]  Project Veritas Whistleblowers.
[2:52:44.300 --> 2:52:49.020]  Jacob in Ohio, welcome, go ahead.
[2:52:49.020 --> 2:52:50.580]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[2:52:50.580 --> 2:52:51.580]  Good.
[2:52:51.580 --> 2:52:52.580]  Great last caller.
[2:52:52.580 --> 2:52:54.580]  I just wanted to start with plugging your sleep supplement.
[2:52:54.580 --> 2:52:59.620]  It's basically the only way I get sleep anymore with all the gaslighting, the moralization
[2:52:59.620 --> 2:53:00.620]  and absurdity.
[2:53:00.620 --> 2:53:04.580]  It's like we're living at a twilight zone and, all right, Eric in New Hampshire.
[2:53:04.580 --> 2:53:05.580]  Eric, thanks for calling.
[2:53:05.580 --> 2:53:06.580]  Go ahead.
[2:53:06.580 --> 2:53:07.580]  Hey, Alex.
[2:53:07.580 --> 2:53:08.580]  Thanks for taking my call.
[2:53:08.580 --> 2:53:10.460]  If I could, I just want to throw a quick plug out for the point of the product.
[2:53:10.460 --> 2:53:14.460]  The X2 does wonders, they recommend it to everybody here on the fence about it.
[2:53:14.460 --> 2:53:17.340]  Get off the fence, get the product, support the info ward.
[2:53:17.340 --> 2:53:19.340]  Tyler in Maine, you're on the year.
[2:53:19.340 --> 2:53:20.340]  Thanks for holding.
[2:53:20.340 --> 2:53:21.340]  Go ahead.
[2:53:21.340 --> 2:53:22.340]  Hey, Alex.
[2:53:22.340 --> 2:53:23.340]  It's great to be on with you.
[2:53:23.340 --> 2:53:24.340]  It's an honor.
[2:53:24.340 --> 2:53:25.340]  All right.
[2:53:25.340 --> 2:53:30.300]  So, first thing I wanted to do was say I love the product, Alpha Power, even at 29.
[2:53:30.300 --> 2:53:35.180]  If you ask my better half, she loves it and it helps in the bedroom, so just number one
[2:53:35.180 --> 2:53:36.180]  for a few of you.
[2:53:36.180 --> 2:53:37.180]  Well, it definitely works.
[2:53:37.180 --> 2:53:38.180]  It's not a joke.
[2:53:38.180 --> 2:53:39.180]  Absolutely.
[2:53:39.180 --> 2:53:41.180]  The biosecurity state is here.
[2:53:41.180 --> 2:53:54.180]  It's an anti-human eugenics operation training us that humans are dirty, bad and evil.
[2:53:54.180 --> 2:53:59.500]  The corrupt, puppet prime minister of Canada, who says he admires the communist dictatorship
[2:53:59.500 --> 2:54:05.260]  of Xi Jinping and wishes to make Canada the same, has announced that they're buying vaccines
[2:54:05.260 --> 2:54:10.900]  for every person in the country all the way out to 2024 and that in 2024, you will again
[2:54:10.900 --> 2:54:16.860]  take two shots and he says it'll be whatever Pfizer cooks up and wants to put in your body.
[2:54:16.860 --> 2:54:18.580]  This is the Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:54:18.580 --> 2:54:22.340]  They developed this whole plan with Bill Gates, they're now implementing it and now
[2:54:22.340 --> 2:54:25.940]  they've announced that U.S. policy is set by the private Rockefeller Foundation.
[2:54:25.940 --> 2:54:30.820]  Of course, the Rockefeller Foundation by the 30s was the main funder of Adolf, Alois
[2:54:30.820 --> 2:54:34.900]  Hitler, and the eugenics at Cold Springs Harbor that trained the Coserville home institute
[2:54:34.900 --> 2:54:35.900]  in Germany.
[2:54:35.900 --> 2:54:39.780]  And Volwars will continue to set fast, they fight this, I don't know how long we can.
[2:54:39.780 --> 2:54:42.620]  The enemy's coming for us all now, and God bless and good luck.
[2:54:42.620 --> 2:54:48.420]  I would again get right with God right now.
[2:54:48.420 --> 2:55:10.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:55:10.020 --> 2:55:11.020]  Welcome back to Adwars.
[2:55:11.020 --> 2:55:13.020]  This is Christy Lee.
[2:55:13.020 --> 2:55:19.300]  I contributed a report, I have gone independent and you can find my stories on my website,
[2:55:19.300 --> 2:55:24.860]  but I have also shared them with band.video because the most important thing is the information
[2:55:24.860 --> 2:55:25.860]  can get out.
[2:55:25.860 --> 2:55:29.180]  Well, apparently we have Alex on the phone right now.
[2:55:29.180 --> 2:55:31.580]  All right, it's always fun.
[2:55:31.580 --> 2:55:34.420]  Christy Lee's reports can be found at band.video.
[2:55:34.420 --> 2:55:38.780]  Go ahead and roll the report, guys.
[2:55:38.780 --> 2:55:43.980]  Coming right now, Border Patrol continuing to drop off migrants here at Catholic Charities
[2:55:43.980 --> 2:55:44.980]  of the Rio Grande Valley.
[2:55:44.980 --> 2:55:50.140]  We're on the corner of 15th and Austin, we've been watching this happen all day long.
[2:55:50.140 --> 2:55:53.740]  They say that about 1,000 are coming in a day.
[2:55:53.740 --> 2:55:58.700]  The executive director of Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, we saw her earlier,
[2:55:58.700 --> 2:56:00.220]  she said she would talk to us.
[2:56:00.220 --> 2:56:05.740]  She has yet to come back to us, but she has said in earlier reports that about 1,000 migrants
[2:56:05.740 --> 2:56:11.340]  are being dropped off a day that was confirmed by another volunteer I spoke with.
[2:56:11.340 --> 2:56:14.980]  You said about how many are coming a day?
[2:56:14.980 --> 2:56:18.980]  I think that brings to 1,000, something like that from what I can see.
[2:56:18.980 --> 2:56:23.980]  So the question is, is what's happening to them once they get dropped off?
[2:56:23.980 --> 2:56:29.460]  The other question is, as she said in another report that she had asked Border Patrol to
[2:56:29.460 --> 2:56:34.380]  stop dropping off migrants here because the capacity here at Catholic Charities of the
[2:56:34.380 --> 2:56:40.000]  Rio Grande Valley is 1,200, yet 1,000 are being dropped off a day.
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:46.540]  So again, where are all of these mothers, pregnant women, families, where are they being taken
[2:56:46.540 --> 2:56:47.540]  after this?
[2:56:47.540 --> 2:56:50.140]  Do you know if they're all coming from the same countries, are they all from Mexico?
[2:56:50.140 --> 2:56:51.140]  No, no, no.
[2:56:51.140 --> 2:56:52.140]  Christen, I've heard from many centrals.
[2:56:52.140 --> 2:56:59.780]  There's a lack of transparency and also a shock as we watch this continue to happen.
[2:56:59.780 --> 2:57:04.260]  Bus load after a bus load and I look around and there's no other media here.
[2:57:04.260 --> 2:57:10.300]  There's nobody else covering this and this is happening in light of the highest cases
[2:57:10.300 --> 2:57:15.460]  of COVID-19 in Hidalgo County, according to Judge Cortez.
[2:57:15.460 --> 2:57:23.740]  We heard earlier from the La Jolla police in a post that went viral that they are confirming
[2:57:23.740 --> 2:57:29.060]  what's happening is those that have COVID-19 are being taken to a hotel.
[2:57:29.060 --> 2:57:35.340]  They're booking them in hotels COVID-19 and they're just free to go anywhere after that.
[2:57:35.340 --> 2:57:42.340]  They see dozens of them outside of the hotel, COVID-19 positive, coughing, sneezing, no
[2:57:42.340 --> 2:57:46.260]  masks and then they end up showing up in restaurants.
[2:57:46.260 --> 2:57:47.540]  There's no tracking being done.
[2:57:47.540 --> 2:57:53.060]  So while we are pummeled by mainstream news, which I used to be a part of with this narrative
[2:57:53.060 --> 2:57:57.940]  that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated, are we unconcerned with the migrants that
[2:57:57.940 --> 2:58:04.300]  are coming in, many testing positive for COVID-19 over this building here where they're processed
[2:58:04.300 --> 2:58:09.460]  and then not being tracked, going out into the community and we're seeing a spike in
[2:58:09.460 --> 2:58:10.700]  cases.
[2:58:10.700 --> 2:58:13.260]  Why are we not hearing this from mainstream news?
[2:58:13.260 --> 2:58:15.620]  Why are there no other reporters out here?
[2:58:15.620 --> 2:58:17.140]  These are the questions.
[2:58:17.140 --> 2:58:19.380]  Who is responsible?
[2:58:19.380 --> 2:58:22.300]  Let's take it back to the definition of criminal negligence.
[2:58:22.300 --> 2:58:28.540]  We know that criminal negligence is putting somebody at risk of injury or death.
[2:58:28.540 --> 2:58:34.860]  What does it mean when no one is held responsible for those testing positive for COVID-19, just
[2:58:34.860 --> 2:58:37.780]  being able to go out into the community?
[2:58:37.780 --> 2:58:38.900]  They're at capacity here.
[2:58:38.900 --> 2:58:39.900]  They don't keep them here.
[2:58:39.900 --> 2:58:46.660]  They're just booking them into area hotels and this is happening all across the border.
[2:58:46.660 --> 2:58:48.860]  We don't know how much this is happening.
[2:58:48.860 --> 2:58:51.300]  So who's responsible for this criminal negligence?
[2:58:51.300 --> 2:58:58.540]  That's the definition, putting others at risk or harm or death and no one's held responsible
[2:58:58.540 --> 2:59:00.300]  and we're not hearing it from anywhere else.
[2:59:00.300 --> 2:59:04.940]  We're just continued to be pummeled that this is a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
[2:59:04.940 --> 2:59:05.940]  We want answers.
[2:59:05.940 --> 2:59:12.380]  We're trying to get them from for you, but we're having a hard time talking to anyone.
[2:59:12.380 --> 2:59:17.300]  We heard from the Biden administration, we heard from Biden say he wanted a surge at
[2:59:17.300 --> 2:59:18.300]  the border.
[2:59:18.300 --> 2:59:23.420]  I would in fact make sure that there is, we immediately surge to the border.
[2:59:23.420 --> 2:59:25.340]  All those people are seeking asylum.
[2:59:25.340 --> 2:59:26.500]  They deserve to be heard.
[2:59:26.500 --> 2:59:27.500]  That's who we are.
[2:59:27.500 --> 2:59:29.500]  Well, we are seeing it happen.
[2:59:29.500 --> 2:59:34.660]  We're seeing bus loads and bus loads of people coming in and they're testing positive for
[2:59:34.660 --> 2:59:39.300]  COVID-19 and then we don't know what's happening with them after that.
[2:59:39.300 --> 2:59:43.820]  I did talk to an Uber driver who says he comes here nearly every day to pick up some of these
[2:59:43.820 --> 2:59:46.220]  migrants and it's just a mess in his own words.
[2:59:46.220 --> 2:59:48.060]  He says it's just a mess.
[2:59:48.060 --> 2:59:53.060]  He says that he takes them to the airport and the other day he took them to the airport.
[2:59:53.060 --> 2:59:57.860]  Hello, I'm Mike Lindell and I'm coming to you with the most important commercial that
[2:59:57.860 --> 2:59:59.180]  I've ever done.

[3:01:21.100 --> 3:01:33.900]  Hi friends, here we are, it's July 30th, the year is 2021, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[3:01:33.900 --> 3:01:37.620]  Now sitting in here on the fourth hour ahead of the kickoff, the War Room with oh, enjoy
[3:01:37.620 --> 3:01:39.740]  your 3 p.m. central time.
[3:01:39.740 --> 3:01:42.740]  Remember this broadcast, they're not supposed to be on the air, the globalists want to shut
[3:01:42.740 --> 3:01:44.220]  down, they want it, silence.
[3:01:44.220 --> 3:01:47.660]  Okay, we're gonna cover the waterfront and a lot of clips we didn't get to in the last
[3:01:47.660 --> 3:01:54.140]  three hours of breaking news during this fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:01:54.140 --> 3:01:58.700]  Next segment, we have not Biden saying he got his butt wiped today, that's already a
[3:01:58.700 --> 3:02:00.580]  week old.
[3:02:00.580 --> 3:02:07.780]  We have Biden being told he has a large yellow booger on his chin, which he then grabs and
[3:02:07.780 --> 3:02:13.060]  eats with peer enjoyment right on international television.
[3:02:13.060 --> 3:02:17.700]  So the dementia is really setting in, I would imagine he'll start writing with his feces
[3:02:17.700 --> 3:02:22.180]  on the walls next, but this is emblematic of the globalists and they put him in on purpose
[3:02:22.180 --> 3:02:27.140]  knowing he was dementia and controlled, frozen to moralize the country and the world is meant
[3:02:27.140 --> 3:02:29.140]  to break your will.
[3:02:29.140 --> 3:02:33.180]  Plus all the crimes he's committing, you know, once he's totally has Alzheimer's, they'll
[3:02:33.180 --> 3:02:38.500]  just say he did it, they're not the criminal factions that are around him.
[3:02:38.500 --> 3:02:46.500]  Joe Biden, now ladies and gentlemen, eating buggers on national television, that is coming
[3:02:46.500 --> 3:02:47.500]  up.
[3:02:47.500 --> 3:02:52.460]  This man is a pedophile, this man is a Chinese communist agent, this man is a liar, this
[3:02:52.460 --> 3:02:55.700]  man is not the president, this man is fraud.
[3:02:55.700 --> 3:03:00.460]  And I have masses of articles here where all over the world are trying to pass laws in
[3:03:00.460 --> 3:03:04.620]  Canada and in Australia, now the Democrats want them passed here where you can't criticize
[3:03:04.620 --> 3:03:05.860]  people or you get arrested.
[3:03:05.860 --> 3:03:11.860]  I mean, these people were just absolutely anti-offering space, but this story broke
[3:03:11.860 --> 3:03:18.260]  five or six days ago and we did play it, I think it was on the Sunday show last week.
[3:03:18.260 --> 3:03:22.020]  And I wanted to play this again, it's finally getting more attention.
[3:03:22.020 --> 3:03:28.580]  We've known for really a year and a half because two years ago the inventor of PCR tests already
[3:03:28.580 --> 3:03:35.140]  went public and said his test is being used for fraud because it's only an indicator test
[3:03:35.140 --> 3:03:39.980]  of whatever you're testing for and if you turn it up too high, it will find anything
[3:03:39.980 --> 3:03:42.980]  you want what you set it to in the atmosphere.
[3:03:42.980 --> 3:03:48.100]  That's similar to a lot of the DNA tests they do where, again, like a man took spit from
[3:03:48.100 --> 3:03:53.460]  his lizard, sent it in, and it came back as human, which of course it wasn't for 23
[3:03:53.460 --> 3:03:55.460]  and me, the serenade group.
[3:03:55.460 --> 3:04:01.660]  And the reason I hammer on that is these blood tests, these smugest tests, all these things,
[3:04:01.660 --> 3:04:09.420]  they set them for the results they want, so imagine a newborn baby in the UK and in comes
[3:04:09.420 --> 3:04:15.460]  the National Health Service saying, we're going to stick, and obviously, again, they're
[3:04:15.460 --> 3:04:18.780]  really at the DNA test, they meant they're keeping these, we're going to stick this
[3:04:18.780 --> 3:04:22.660]  all the way up in your baby's sinus cavity, we're going to jam it up in there to see if
[3:04:22.660 --> 3:04:27.340]  your baby has COVID and not only is that fraudulent ridiculous because the mother didn't have
[3:04:27.340 --> 3:04:33.300]  it on its face, but it's doubly fraudulent because it was a PCR test.
[3:04:33.300 --> 3:04:38.260]  So they're still using PCR tests selectively whenever they want, and those nurses don't
[3:04:38.260 --> 3:04:42.780]  now, they can just set it to 40 cycles, you're going to be 100% positive, and then you're
[3:04:42.780 --> 3:04:44.260]  disappeared by the contact tracers.
[3:04:44.260 --> 3:04:48.220]  So think about all the forms of tearing the world, you never put up with the cops acting
[3:04:48.220 --> 3:04:52.100]  like this, you wouldn't put up with lawyers acting like this, you wouldn't put up with
[3:04:52.100 --> 3:04:55.940]  politicians doing this, but if it's the medical service, they've been conditioned to just
[3:04:55.940 --> 3:04:57.740]  bow down and accept it.
[3:04:57.740 --> 3:05:02.060]  So the Rockefeller Foundation and others are on record studying how to take over, and
[3:05:02.060 --> 3:05:07.180]  they said the medical system is our best shot at a world ID and authoritarian control.
[3:05:07.180 --> 3:05:09.660]  So just, I want to play this video again, because I want this to be forgotten.
[3:05:09.660 --> 3:05:14.020]  I was on Paul Watson's Twitter, that's all he retweeted to Don Salazar's incredibly
[3:05:14.020 --> 3:05:19.380]  important article that we'll get to coming up that I hammered in the first hour, where
[3:05:19.380 --> 3:05:28.900]  more than 20 nations that have the strongest forced COVID injections of 98% in Gibraltar,
[3:05:28.900 --> 3:05:38.380]  90% plus in Iceland, 80% plus in Singapore, the list goes on and on.
[3:05:38.380 --> 3:05:41.380]  They have the highest COVID rates, the highest death rates, and it is the people that have
[3:05:41.380 --> 3:05:45.700]  been injected that are getting sick and dying, and Fauci can say 99% of those dying didn't
[3:05:45.700 --> 3:05:49.300]  have a shot all day, that's just totally pulled out of his rear end like everything else.
[3:05:49.300 --> 3:05:51.380]  The criminal lives, but they won't cook in the data.
[3:05:51.380 --> 3:05:56.580]  They finally did a few days ago, and of course it was, all the data from the beginning of
[3:05:56.580 --> 3:06:02.500]  the COVID, so-called pandemic, a year and a half ago until the end of January this year
[3:06:02.500 --> 3:06:05.620]  with only one month of inoculation in the United States, and they didn't count any people
[3:06:05.620 --> 3:06:11.500]  that had been inoculated to see they had COVID, so they excluded those numbers, so total fraud.
[3:06:11.500 --> 3:06:14.340]  But Fauci thinks you're so stupid, and he's got all the corporate media lying for him
[3:06:14.340 --> 3:06:16.420]  and he's pushing it, but that's where I was.
[3:06:16.420 --> 3:06:19.420]  Here is the video in the audio, because we've had to bleep it.
[3:06:19.420 --> 3:06:24.540]  The woman has just had her baby, here come the nurses, they're going to jam a big Q-tip
[3:06:24.540 --> 3:06:32.620]  up the baby's nose, see if it has COVID, absolutely asinine, absolutely bull, but remember, a
[3:06:32.620 --> 3:06:38.100]  lot of times they want to take children, they just turn the PCR test up and take you away,
[3:06:38.100 --> 3:06:39.340]  and it doesn't matter if it's fraudulent.
[3:06:39.340 --> 3:06:44.100]  If you like cops having a radar detector, and you know you're driving 50 and a 50 and
[3:06:44.100 --> 3:06:50.260]  a 100, you're being arrested for reckless driving, and you're like, that's not science,
[3:06:50.260 --> 3:06:54.420]  that's a fraud, and you say, shut up, see, cops wouldn't get away with this, cops wouldn't
[3:06:54.420 --> 3:06:58.740]  want to act like this, I don't lionize cops, they don't want to destroy their own country.
[3:06:58.740 --> 3:07:03.460]  These globalists do, and the good nurses and the good doctors are all being kicked out
[3:07:03.460 --> 3:07:06.940]  right now, so it's absolutely insane.
[3:07:06.940 --> 3:07:12.500]  Medical systems the best of times, the worst of times, a tale of two cities, because it's
[3:07:12.500 --> 3:07:16.020]  great doctors and great nurses and great scientists, the majority of which are fighting
[3:07:16.020 --> 3:07:19.860]  this giant lie, but they're being silenced, so this is big tech, big corporate, big pharma
[3:07:19.860 --> 3:07:24.540]  takeover, and to watch the left fawning at big pharma, and fawning at the intelligence
[3:07:24.540 --> 3:07:27.900]  agencies that are killing our country and the world, it's really disgusting, because
[3:07:27.900 --> 3:07:30.860]  there'd be one thing, they were just evil, they were getting power out of this, but the
[3:07:30.860 --> 3:07:34.740]  left is all being disenfranchised as well, it's total delusion.
[3:07:34.740 --> 3:07:37.980]  So here is a little look at the future, everything you see in the UK and Australia is what they
[3:07:37.980 --> 3:07:44.540]  want to bring here, the idiocy, the anti-science of testing a baby with a fake test, when
[3:07:44.540 --> 3:07:48.820]  the woman of course started testing, doesn't have COVID, this is all a giant fraud, fraud
[3:07:48.820 --> 3:07:52.820]  stacked on fraud, stacked on fraud, stacked on charity, here it is.
[3:07:52.820 --> 3:08:00.820]  Right or wrong, because it is my property, so you will, while the faith is in your abdomen.
[3:08:00.820 --> 3:08:03.980]  So you're saying to me, once the baby comes out, it's not my property no more, yes it
[3:08:03.980 --> 3:08:08.140]  is, okay, first of all it's blood running through its veins, okay Stacey, I'm just trying to
[3:08:08.140 --> 3:08:09.140]  explain to you what I think to you.
[3:08:09.140 --> 3:08:10.140]  Well you're not helping me.
[3:08:10.140 --> 3:08:11.140]  You see what you're doing.
[3:08:11.140 --> 3:08:12.140]  Now you're stressing.
[3:08:12.140 --> 3:08:17.140]  I'm going to stop you now, because I don't want to hear no more of it, this is my duty.
[3:08:17.140 --> 3:08:23.140]  Listen, you don't want to do anything, because you told me about five bloody times, and I'm
[3:08:23.140 --> 3:08:27.980]  sick of hearing it, I don't need distress, once again I look at you stressing out, I
[3:08:27.980 --> 3:08:32.980]  haven't leaked all day, now I'm leaking, do you really think I leaked this all that COVID
[3:08:32.980 --> 3:08:36.980]  and I've got a risk of losing my baby, or possibly something.
[3:08:36.980 --> 3:08:38.980]  Exactly, you're more worried about COVID than the baby.
[3:08:38.980 --> 3:08:39.980]  No, that is COVID.
[3:08:39.980 --> 3:08:43.980]  You know what Stacey, let's get our stuff and get out of here now, because this is pissing
[3:08:43.980 --> 3:08:44.980]  me off.
[3:08:44.980 --> 3:08:45.980]  This is COVID.
[3:08:45.980 --> 3:08:46.980]  No, what is it?
[3:08:46.980 --> 3:08:47.980]  Sorry, what is it?
[3:08:47.980 --> 3:08:52.980]  We signed in on our cell phone now Stacey, they're not COVID testing my baby enough, so
[3:08:52.980 --> 3:08:57.980]  we're going to get security if we don't apply now.
[3:08:57.980 --> 3:08:58.980]  This is wicked.
[3:08:58.980 --> 3:09:01.980]  Do you know this is going viral, this is disgusting.
[3:09:01.980 --> 3:09:05.980]  I've been outside all day long, so now I'm not in your company, because I know how you
[3:09:05.980 --> 3:09:06.980]  want to feel.
[3:09:06.980 --> 3:09:10.980]  You know, I mainly don't want me here really, I mainly don't want to have to do what you've
[3:09:10.980 --> 3:09:16.980]  got to do, because of this stupid complying crap, but I'm sorry, when it comes to care
[3:09:16.980 --> 3:09:20.980]  for a patient or something, you've got to understand and listen to what they're saying.
[3:09:20.980 --> 3:09:26.980]  You can't tell me that you get to give me the say of what happens once my baby's born.
[3:09:26.980 --> 3:09:27.980]  I don't think so.
[3:09:27.980 --> 3:09:28.980]  I don't think so.
[3:09:28.980 --> 3:09:31.980]  Do you know what I even spoke to a police officer?
[3:09:31.980 --> 3:09:32.980]  People like that.
[3:09:32.980 --> 3:09:34.980]  We spoke to doctors and nurses and everything.
[3:09:34.980 --> 3:09:39.980]  I've given nothing to my baby without my permission, so I'll stop you there.
[3:09:39.980 --> 3:09:40.980]  End of.
[3:09:40.980 --> 3:09:42.980]  So, I've just said that I'm clear.
[3:09:42.980 --> 3:09:46.980]  This will be documented in your notes that we've got.
[3:09:46.980 --> 3:09:53.980]  Okay, this is now going to go viral to other nurses, other nurses as well.
[3:09:53.980 --> 3:09:58.980]  We've got the near little team that we've had.
[3:09:58.980 --> 3:10:03.980]  And we will also, about COVID testing the baby.
[3:10:03.980 --> 3:10:04.980]  That's fine.
[3:10:04.980 --> 3:10:07.980]  That's how I bring them on.
[3:10:07.980 --> 3:10:08.980]  Okay.
[3:10:08.980 --> 3:10:15.980]  This is all, this is all a giant evil power grab.
[3:10:15.980 --> 3:10:21.980]  And notice, all over the international news, whether it's Chinese news or US news or Canadian
[3:10:21.980 --> 3:10:23.980]  news or Mexican news, you see it everywhere.
[3:10:23.980 --> 3:10:25.980]  It's Spanish every other language.
[3:10:25.980 --> 3:10:27.980]  Babies are the super spreaders.
[3:10:27.980 --> 3:10:30.980]  Children are the spreaders because they won't take the shot.
[3:10:30.980 --> 3:10:35.980]  They're trying to give an illegal, experimental shot to children and babies and leptis are
[3:10:35.980 --> 3:10:37.980]  lining up to have their newborn babies tested on.
[3:10:37.980 --> 3:10:39.980]  Of course, some of which are dying.
[3:10:39.980 --> 3:10:41.980]  This is period.
[3:10:41.980 --> 3:10:52.980]  I'll stay with us.
[3:11:11.980 --> 3:11:19.980]  This historical event will be live streamed 72 hours straight on my new platform, frankspeech.com.

[3:13:14.980 --> 3:13:16.980]  It's a fact.
[3:13:16.980 --> 3:13:24.980]  It's a reality of human experience in the history we recorded on this planet in the last 7,000 years of recorded history.
[3:13:24.980 --> 3:13:32.980]  That routinely evil corrupt people that seek absolute power control get control of absolutely every culture.
[3:13:32.980 --> 3:13:34.980]  It's happened everywhere in Africa.
[3:13:34.980 --> 3:13:35.980]  It's happened everywhere in Europe.
[3:13:35.980 --> 3:13:36.980]  It's happened everywhere in Asia.
[3:13:36.980 --> 3:13:38.980]  It's happened everywhere in Mesoamerica.
[3:13:38.980 --> 3:13:40.980]  It's Latin America today.
[3:13:40.980 --> 3:13:45.980]  But you'll have a big boom time in science and exploration and people expanding,
[3:13:45.980 --> 3:13:51.980]  and as soon as the public becomes fat and dumb and happy, they become corrupt.
[3:13:51.980 --> 3:13:53.980]  And then it's always a pre-class.
[3:13:53.980 --> 3:14:00.980]  Use a superstition and mumbo jumbo to start demanding offerings of the best houses and the best temples
[3:14:00.980 --> 3:14:03.980]  and the best castles and the best food and the best art.
[3:14:03.980 --> 3:14:08.980]  And then they start demanding the daughters and they start demanding the sons of the general public
[3:14:08.980 --> 3:14:10.980]  and then demand the noblemen.
[3:14:10.980 --> 3:14:12.980]  Then the priests start taking over the royalty.
[3:14:12.980 --> 3:14:16.980]  But you get the strongest warriors, the rest of it.
[3:14:16.980 --> 3:14:18.980]  And then they demand human sacrifice.
[3:14:18.980 --> 3:14:21.980]  And it doesn't matter if it was the ancient Egyptians.
[3:14:21.980 --> 3:14:22.980]  It doesn't matter.
[3:14:22.980 --> 3:14:24.980]  You have to demand the first born of the Israelites.
[3:14:24.980 --> 3:14:25.980]  That's a historical fact.
[3:14:25.980 --> 3:14:27.980]  That's carved on the side of the pyramids.
[3:14:27.980 --> 3:14:28.980]  It doesn't matter.
[3:14:28.980 --> 3:14:37.980]  Every culture did this right where I am or about to be gone in Lake Tahoe.
[3:14:37.980 --> 3:14:46.980]  And here in Nevada, very near where I'm at on the lake is a big famous rock where archaeologists
[3:14:46.980 --> 3:14:53.980]  have gone down and found the bones of hundreds and hundreds of dead babies that the one particular native tribe
[3:14:53.980 --> 3:14:59.980]  was like they would do throwing kids into volcanoes in Kona, the big island.
[3:14:59.980 --> 3:15:02.980]  They also sacrificed kids and all the other Hawaiian islands.
[3:15:02.980 --> 3:15:07.980]  So that's Native Americans here in the United States and what is Nevada today around the
[3:15:07.980 --> 3:15:08.980]  border of California.
[3:15:08.980 --> 3:15:12.980]  And then that's going back to just a couple of years ago, the Hawaiians.
[3:15:12.980 --> 3:15:14.980]  And I'm not judging any of these people.
[3:15:14.980 --> 3:15:15.980]  All the whites did it.
[3:15:15.980 --> 3:15:17.980]  The brown people did it.
[3:15:17.980 --> 3:15:19.980]  Everybody sacrificed humans.
[3:15:19.980 --> 3:15:22.980]  And so, I mean, I didn't even know that about Reno.
[3:15:22.980 --> 3:15:28.980]  I didn't even know that, that they'd throw him off his cliff into the water as a sacrifice.
[3:15:28.980 --> 3:15:32.980]  So when would they do it, when the crops didn't come in?
[3:15:32.980 --> 3:15:34.980]  Well, there wasn't enough game.
[3:15:34.980 --> 3:15:36.980]  They would say, we're bad.
[3:15:36.980 --> 3:15:40.980]  We have overweighed the earth and we need to kill our children.
[3:15:40.980 --> 3:15:42.980]  The gods say, kill our children.
[3:15:42.980 --> 3:15:48.980]  And that's the same thing that's been going on with Plato 2,200 years ago.
[3:15:48.980 --> 3:15:58.980]  He said, he said, we're crushing Mother Earth's breast.
[3:15:58.980 --> 3:16:01.980]  We just need to kill off all the poor people, period, and just get rid of the underclass.
[3:16:01.980 --> 3:16:03.980]  So see, that's the attitude everywhere.
[3:16:03.980 --> 3:16:08.980]  So when you see these deadly vaccines, they say they want to save you, but it's from the
[3:16:08.980 --> 3:16:09.980]  abortionists.
[3:16:09.980 --> 3:16:10.980]  It's from the eugenicists.
[3:16:10.980 --> 3:16:11.980]  It's from the depopulationists.
[3:16:11.980 --> 3:16:15.980]  Their body of work, the books they write, the things they do is about depopulation.
[3:16:15.980 --> 3:16:18.980]  They want you to take a shot because they love you so much.
[3:16:18.980 --> 3:16:21.980]  And that shot, of course, is like the sterilization and death.
[3:16:21.980 --> 3:16:23.980]  So this is not even hidden.
[3:16:23.980 --> 3:16:25.980]  And they don't want you to feel good about a good tribal leader.
[3:16:25.980 --> 3:16:30.980]  So the same arch-tapel thing of our tribal leader being a president over the executive
[3:16:30.980 --> 3:16:34.980]  branch, not being strong, not standing up for us, not trying to get better trade deals
[3:16:34.980 --> 3:16:40.980]  like Trump did, but actually working against us and being weak, walking up and talking
[3:16:40.980 --> 3:16:46.980]  as butthole boogers on TV, the video is now on infowars.com, a big booger around his chin.
[3:16:46.980 --> 3:16:48.980]  He just deliciously enjoys it.
[3:16:48.980 --> 3:16:54.980]  This is the dementia, but they did this on purpose because the priest class wants to
[3:16:54.980 --> 3:16:56.980]  devalue all of our arch-taps.
[3:16:56.980 --> 3:16:59.980]  And in the final equation, they always take down the king.
[3:16:59.980 --> 3:17:04.980]  And when they do that, they then finally plunge the society into complete collapse.
[3:17:04.980 --> 3:17:07.980]  So the priest class did this everywhere.
[3:17:07.980 --> 3:17:09.980]  Everybody's always heard about the Vikings.
[3:17:09.980 --> 3:17:15.980]  And when a Viking king would die, they would usually take his wife and maybe even her daughters
[3:17:15.980 --> 3:17:18.980]  and tie them up to the boat with him and light them on fire.
[3:17:18.980 --> 3:17:23.980]  They found it just recently found three years ago in southern England, a giant complex.
[3:17:23.980 --> 3:17:29.980]  It's a city of the dead with the Celts, pre-Roman.
[3:17:29.980 --> 3:17:33.980]  And they found all the chariots with the different kings that would die buried.
[3:17:33.980 --> 3:17:39.980]  And of course, next to them, their families, other than the sons slaughtered, laying right next to them.
[3:17:39.980 --> 3:17:43.980]  So this is some sick thing that develops over and over again.
[3:17:43.980 --> 3:17:45.980]  And it's happening again.
[3:17:45.980 --> 3:17:46.980]  It's in the sociology.
[3:17:46.980 --> 3:17:47.980]  It's in the anthropology.
[3:17:47.980 --> 3:17:48.980]  It's in the culture.
[3:17:48.980 --> 3:17:51.980]  And I'm just observing it with my own organic terms.
[3:17:51.980 --> 3:17:55.980]  You're not going to find a lot of this even in literature, but the globalists know this.
[3:17:55.980 --> 3:18:00.980]  So here is the footage for TV viewers and the audio for your listeners of Biden, the public president,
[3:18:00.980 --> 3:18:03.980]  talking about getting his butt wiped.
[3:18:03.980 --> 3:18:05.980]  We'll play it a few times because, you know, Stubbs says it isn't true.
[3:18:05.980 --> 3:18:06.980]  Nobody saw it.
[3:18:06.980 --> 3:18:07.980]  The video is real.
[3:18:07.980 --> 3:18:10.980]  And then now he is resorted to eating bugger chariots.
[3:18:21.980 --> 3:18:26.980]  And expand your capacity is through the partnership that we have, the federal and state government,
[3:18:26.980 --> 3:18:28.980]  along with local governments.
[3:18:28.980 --> 3:18:32.980]  This issue is ongoing each year as we have discussed.
[3:18:32.980 --> 3:18:33.980]  It gets worse.
[3:18:33.980 --> 3:18:35.980]  It affects real people.
[3:18:35.980 --> 3:18:40.980]  Everything from children who are breathing the bugger chariots.
[3:18:40.980 --> 3:18:46.980]  And then again, he sees the thing on his chin and eats it when the aide tells him.
[3:18:46.980 --> 3:18:49.980]  So he's a man totally distracted from reality.
[3:18:49.980 --> 3:18:52.980]  And this is done so they can commit all these crimes and then later blame it on him.
[3:18:52.980 --> 3:18:55.980]  And he want to remember what planet he's on if he's still alive.
[3:18:55.980 --> 3:18:58.980]  Now, this is a shorter segment.
[3:18:58.980 --> 3:19:03.980]  We've got a longer segment coming up that I've just got to tell listeners something right now.
[3:19:03.980 --> 3:19:08.980]  We are in a knock down drag out with the new world order.
[3:19:08.980 --> 3:19:13.980]  And they've launched their full attack and they've got a bunch of big attacks that are going to follow the fully collapsed civilization.
[3:19:13.980 --> 3:19:19.980]  So when we get out of this, being honest with ourselves and speaking up and taking action, but let me just tell you, they're not doing well.
[3:19:19.980 --> 3:19:23.980]  As bad as you think things are, their program is falling apart.
[3:19:23.980 --> 3:19:29.980]  The massive numbers of doctors and scientists are exposing the fraud of covid and the inoculations of the PCR test.
[3:19:29.980 --> 3:19:31.980]  The wheels are coming off.
[3:19:31.980 --> 3:19:33.980]  And so they're really panicked.
[3:19:33.980 --> 3:19:36.980]  That's a good thing we're fighting back, but also get really concerned.
[3:19:36.980 --> 3:19:40.980]  Because that means that they got a bunch of other tricks up their sleeves and there's no teller.
[3:19:40.980 --> 3:19:41.980]  They're going to pull max.
[3:19:41.980 --> 3:19:50.980]  They launched this whole covid thing out of Wuhan, the rest of it to scare the hell out of people and bring in total control because the populace rebellion taking place worldwide.
[3:19:50.980 --> 3:19:54.980]  Well, they've got even bigger plans as we begin to defeat them at this level.
[3:19:54.980 --> 3:19:59.980]  But again, we can't capitulate because they're going to slowly kill us and torture us and deindustrialize us anyway.
[3:19:59.980 --> 3:20:01.980]  So we're damned if we submit.
[3:20:01.980 --> 3:20:03.980]  We're damned if we fight back.
[3:20:03.980 --> 3:20:04.980]  It doesn't matter.
[3:20:04.980 --> 3:20:05.980]  We're doing this for God.
[3:20:05.980 --> 3:20:07.980]  God wants to see us take action.
[3:20:07.980 --> 3:20:08.980]  God doesn't like downwards.
[3:20:08.980 --> 3:20:10.980]  So God will come to our aid.
[3:20:10.980 --> 3:20:15.980]  God will raise up mighty men and women who will be leaders.
[3:20:15.980 --> 3:20:16.980]  And this is about souls.
[3:20:16.980 --> 3:20:18.980]  And this is going to be one hell of a contest.
[3:20:18.980 --> 3:20:21.980]  This is a giant battle of free will versus Satanism.
[3:20:21.980 --> 3:20:24.980]  And so all I can tell you is I salute the listeners.
[3:20:24.980 --> 3:20:27.980]  Now you realize I'm not just saluting you for a reason I feel good.
[3:20:27.980 --> 3:20:29.980]  You've been the incredible typical spirits.
[3:20:29.980 --> 3:20:34.980]  I want you to look in the mirror today and just thank God for your family background or whatever you happen in your life.
[3:20:34.980 --> 3:20:37.980]  Whatever it is that God touches you to be awake and be involved.
[3:20:37.980 --> 3:20:41.980]  The fact out of billions of people, you're part of the millions.
[3:20:41.980 --> 3:20:48.980]  Karen, tune into the show and put up with me because your spirit tells you despite all my problems, this is the real deal.
[3:20:48.980 --> 3:20:50.980]  We're doing this together.
[3:20:50.980 --> 3:20:58.980]  And so the crew and everybody else and all of our affiliates and all of our listeners and sponsors, I just love you and I appreciate you.
[3:20:58.980 --> 3:21:05.980]  And the great part is as horrible as these globalists are and as nasty as they are and as depressing as it is to see how they get away with all this evil.
[3:21:05.980 --> 3:21:14.980]  I also get to meet all the best men and women in the world, every race, color and creed and experience, your amazing commitment and your understanding and your discernment.
[3:21:14.980 --> 3:21:22.980]  And just to see your soul in your eyes and to see the energy of the Holy Spirit reflected out of you is so wonderful.
[3:21:22.980 --> 3:21:23.980]  And it's an amazing blessing.
[3:21:23.980 --> 3:21:26.980]  We'll be right back with huge news.
[3:21:26.980 --> 3:21:27.980]  So stay with us.
[3:21:27.980 --> 3:21:28.980]  Please put the word in for war.
[3:21:28.980 --> 3:21:47.980]  It's not the virus that's on the bars this day.
[3:21:47.980 --> 3:21:55.980]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[3:21:55.980 --> 3:22:01.400]  The globalists are out on the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot
[3:22:01.400 --> 3:22:02.400]  takeover.
[3:22:02.400 --> 3:22:05.540]  But the good news is, we've been working and you've been working, and others have been
[3:22:05.540 --> 3:22:10.440]  working across the planet for decades to get ready for this, to be able to find it off.
[3:22:10.440 --> 3:22:14.560]  Humanity is strong, we're incredible, and if we're aware of the attack that's happening,
[3:22:14.560 --> 3:22:16.240]  we have a real chance of defeating it.
[3:22:16.240 --> 3:22:18.720]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[3:22:18.720 --> 3:22:22.960]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning
[3:22:22.960 --> 3:22:24.560]  others is absolutely essential.
[3:22:24.560 --> 3:22:29.200]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high-quality products to keep us
[3:22:29.200 --> 3:22:32.880]  on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're
[3:22:32.880 --> 3:22:34.560]  also funding our operation.
[3:22:34.560 --> 3:22:35.560]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[3:22:35.560 --> 3:22:36.560]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[3:22:36.560 --> 3:22:42.520]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because of supply chain breakdowns are
[3:22:42.520 --> 3:22:45.000]  back in like bodies, vasobates, and others.
[3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:52.560]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com, and I thank you for being part of the Resistance.
[3:22:52.560 --> 3:22:57.080]  Globalists are having their revolution, but for humanity it has to have its revolution.
[3:22:57.080 --> 3:23:05.840]  We have to first recognize this anti-human takeovers, trying to enslave the entire biological
[3:23:05.840 --> 3:23:13.840]  processes of humans and turn us into these artificial, corporate, controlled slaves,
[3:23:13.840 --> 3:23:22.680]  orson slaves, just property from cradle to grave of the system rendered down to be servile
[3:23:22.680 --> 3:23:27.560]  minions of the system and a ritual of dominance and safety and control.
[3:23:27.560 --> 3:23:32.560]  We have to recognize the great reset post-industrial world that relies on the nightmare dystopia,
[3:23:32.560 --> 3:23:37.600]  and we have to promote liberty and freedom that is the opposite of their dystopia.
[3:23:37.600 --> 3:23:42.680]  It's that choice, it's that realization that's going to change the world, and it's the only
[3:23:42.680 --> 3:23:46.200]  choice we've got, freedom or slavery, go to evil.
[3:23:46.200 --> 3:24:16.160]  It is a spiritual battle, and InfoWars at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[3:24:16.160 --> 3:24:27.160]  It is a spiritual battle, and InfoWars at the tip of the spear fighting it, and InfoWars
[3:24:27.160 --> 3:24:30.160]  at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[3:24:30.160 --> 3:24:50.160]  It is a spiritual battle, and InfoWars at the tip of the spear fighting it, and InfoWars
[3:24:50.160 --> 3:24:52.160]  at the tip of the spear fighting it.
[3:24:52.160 --> 3:25:07.360]  It is a spiritual battle, and InfoWars at the tip of the spear fighting it, and InfoWars
[3:25:07.360 --> 3:25:21.960]  at the tip of the spear fighting it, and InfoWars at the tip of the spear fighting it, and
[3:25:21.960 --> 3:25:26.340]  What do you know to go to frankspeech.com now?

[3:25:37.220 --> 3:25:39.140]  Thank you and God bless.

[3:25:48.860 --> 3:25:53.500]  ALIX.
[3:25:53.500 --> 3:26:19.600]  We're listening to the ALIX Jones show.
[3:26:19.600 --> 3:26:23.180]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[3:26:23.180 --> 3:26:31.760]  And by the grace of God, we are live still on there and thanks to you holding us in position
[3:26:31.760 --> 3:26:34.500]  like God holds the universe together with His will.
[3:26:34.500 --> 3:26:37.740]  You hold us on air with your support, your word of mouth, and your prayer.
[3:26:37.740 --> 3:26:39.260]  Thank you so much to all of you.
[3:26:39.260 --> 3:26:45.500]  All right, so continuing here, you see the predatory angle that society goes in.
[3:26:45.500 --> 3:26:51.180]  When we don't hold up decency and honor and honor the individual, when we don't tie down
[3:26:51.180 --> 3:26:58.940]  powerful organizations, they always get out of control and become tyrannical, which means
[3:26:58.940 --> 3:27:01.940]  the great lizard, the great tearing, the great snake.
[3:27:01.940 --> 3:27:03.220]  And then that's where we are right now.
[3:27:03.220 --> 3:27:07.420]  And remember how many times I specifically told you they're going to bring in world
[3:27:07.420 --> 3:27:11.380]  government, a world ID, using a virus, using fear, that they're going to implode the third
[3:27:11.380 --> 3:27:16.660]  world and use giant migrant waves to come in and collapse the Western world, then there'll
[3:27:16.660 --> 3:27:22.060]  be a worldwide collapse and then they'll call for a worldwide Marshall plan.
[3:27:22.060 --> 3:27:27.740]  I noticed I've been saying this for at least 18 years since a bunch of documents came out
[3:27:27.740 --> 3:27:34.300]  of the North American Union secret treaty that George W. Bush had secretly signed us
[3:27:34.300 --> 3:27:40.300]  on to at Temple, Texas, there at Baylor.
[3:27:40.300 --> 3:27:41.300]  Remember that?
[3:27:41.300 --> 3:27:42.300]  A secret?
[3:27:42.300 --> 3:27:47.500]  Money, the first time we got documents, 18 years ago, they're out for in-game game
[3:27:47.500 --> 3:27:48.500]  out.
[3:27:48.500 --> 3:27:54.780]  15 years ago, judicial watched suit again and got the BAMP's Canada documents, several
[3:27:54.780 --> 3:27:55.780]  thousand pages.
[3:27:55.780 --> 3:27:58.980]  I scanned over every one of the BAMP's.
[3:27:58.980 --> 3:27:59.980]  Unbelievable.
[3:27:59.980 --> 3:28:04.940]  Remember when Lou Dobbs was number one back then, was seeing it and it was different.
[3:28:04.940 --> 3:28:09.540]  He's the whole format because he had like 10 million viewers a night.
[3:28:09.540 --> 3:28:15.180]  So they fired them and shut all that down later, but he had the documents.
[3:28:15.180 --> 3:28:18.420]  So how did I know they were going to use the virus?
[3:28:18.420 --> 3:28:21.220]  How did I know that then they would collapse the third world and use those giant waves
[3:28:21.220 --> 3:28:22.220]  to bring in UN control?
[3:28:22.220 --> 3:28:26.180]  And then after they were done with that, they then collapsed the currency of the world and
[3:28:26.180 --> 3:28:28.380]  they called for a global Marshall plan.
[3:28:28.380 --> 3:28:33.580]  They had over 500 corporate leaders of the Fortune 500 and the leaders of all the Western
[3:28:33.580 --> 3:28:40.100]  world met in BAMP Canada in 2007.
[3:28:40.100 --> 3:28:46.260]  Look it up yourself and then judicial watched, got the documents, maybe 2006, we got them
[3:28:46.260 --> 3:28:47.940]  2007 and it's all there.
[3:28:47.940 --> 3:28:53.020]  So again, how did I know all this because they told us and I keep hammering this because
[3:28:53.020 --> 3:28:59.100]  I was in a CVS last night and I had almost everyone, Hispanic folks that were in there,
[3:28:59.100 --> 3:29:02.660]  white folks that were in there, that was in there, white folks, Hispanic folks, almost
[3:29:02.660 --> 3:29:08.020]  all of them were listeners, the clerk, the manager, everybody, and a guy walks up when
[3:29:08.020 --> 3:29:09.620]  I'm walking out of here and he goes, I appreciate you Alex.
[3:29:09.620 --> 3:29:13.580]  He goes, you know, you're like a profit, facts, you know, all this stuff for the people.
[3:29:13.580 --> 3:29:16.100]  And I said, sir, do you listen to the show and he goes, yeah, I'll catch it sometimes.
[3:29:16.100 --> 3:29:22.780]  And I said, sir, please, it's important you understand that this is all public, but it's
[3:29:22.780 --> 3:29:23.780]  not about us.
[3:29:23.780 --> 3:29:25.280]  That's stupid.
[3:29:25.280 --> 3:29:26.280]  It's about understanding.
[3:29:26.280 --> 3:29:31.740]  It's a criminal enemy plan, a criminal enemy plan.
[3:29:31.740 --> 3:29:37.100]  And so you read the BAMP Canada, the hundreds and hundreds of us, we literally turned a
[3:29:37.100 --> 3:29:38.100]  foul over.
[3:29:38.100 --> 3:29:45.820]  So you took the operation lockstep a few years later, 2011, 2010, and it's even more specific.
[3:29:45.820 --> 3:29:51.980]  Now I'm to find a town that they war game that sucker every year with the major think
[3:29:51.980 --> 3:29:52.980]  tanks.
[3:29:52.980 --> 3:29:59.420]  So there's literally thousands of battle pages and plans and hundreds of drills they've
[3:29:59.420 --> 3:30:08.060]  done for what you're now saying with event 201, which is COVID-19.
[3:30:08.060 --> 3:30:09.060]  And this is it.
[3:30:09.060 --> 3:30:13.900]  This is a civilization, collapsing weapon, the fear of it that brings us to our knees.
[3:30:13.900 --> 3:30:19.540]  And now imagine having all the major channels, God limits the best example we got accomplished
[3:30:19.540 --> 3:30:23.140]  to him two days ago than last night, saying, you shouldn't leave your house, can't go to
[3:30:23.140 --> 3:30:24.740]  the grocery store, shouldn't have a job.
[3:30:24.740 --> 3:30:27.460]  It's time to blame the unvaxxed.
[3:30:27.460 --> 3:30:30.820]  All these Republican governors and Democrat governors saying that world leaders saying
[3:30:30.820 --> 3:30:35.260]  it even though in plain view, it's all the 90 plus percent vaccinated countries that
[3:30:35.260 --> 3:30:38.420]  have the highest level of COVID, because it's not COVID despite protein.
[3:30:38.420 --> 3:30:41.140]  We can jam that truth down their necks.
[3:30:41.140 --> 3:30:44.300]  We need to be at the hospital showing their MP right now, because they're saying they're
[3:30:44.300 --> 3:30:45.300]  full.
[3:30:45.300 --> 3:30:48.380]  We need to be printing off those articles, those documents and those links that Don Salazar
[3:30:48.380 --> 3:30:53.420]  has that article, then FullWars.com and taking it to your church this weekend, because believe
[3:30:53.420 --> 3:30:56.940]  me, if you don't get aggressive and get in front of your church or your Sunday school,
[3:30:56.940 --> 3:31:00.140]  if you don't get aggressive and go to the city council and talk about this, everywhere
[3:31:00.140 --> 3:31:03.340]  you can get a voice, they're going to come to your door.
[3:31:03.340 --> 3:31:07.420]  So everybody better figure this out, either going to submit and think you roll the dice
[3:31:07.420 --> 3:31:12.020]  and take these shots, let them lock the world down, let them declare you a non-essential
[3:31:12.020 --> 3:31:15.580]  and wake your starved death a couple of years in your house, or you can fight back now and
[3:31:15.580 --> 3:31:19.140]  change the world and wake a lot of people up in the process of this fight.
[3:31:19.140 --> 3:31:23.780]  So I know you're fighters, I'm just telling you, now is the time of the import to fight
[3:31:23.780 --> 3:31:24.780]  more than ever.
[3:31:24.780 --> 3:31:30.420]  Because Don Lemon, again, last night, with the night before, compiled declaring war
[3:31:30.420 --> 3:31:33.740]  on you, saying, you will starved death if you don't let me put something experimental
[3:31:33.740 --> 3:31:37.540]  in your body, the essence of violating the Nuremberg Code, coercion for experimental
[3:31:37.540 --> 3:31:40.140]  drugs, here it is.
[3:31:40.140 --> 3:31:44.300]  We could have had this under control, we were well on our way, and the only people that
[3:31:44.300 --> 3:31:49.180]  you can blame, the only people you can blame, this isn't shaming, this is the truth, maybe
[3:31:49.180 --> 3:31:54.940]  they should be shamed, or the unvaccinated, the unvaccinated people have put us in the
[3:31:54.940 --> 3:31:58.220]  position that we're in now, and it is not a good place.
[3:31:58.220 --> 3:32:04.900]  You have to be more direct, a more concerted effort to say get vaccinated, because you're
[3:32:04.900 --> 3:32:08.700]  not just killing yourself, you're going to kill other people.
[3:32:08.700 --> 3:32:10.220]  That's what you have to start telling people.
[3:32:10.220 --> 3:32:14.300]  You got to start telling people, if you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this office
[3:32:14.300 --> 3:32:15.820]  or this place of business.
[3:32:15.820 --> 3:32:18.500]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come to work.
[3:32:18.500 --> 3:32:21.540]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this gym.
[3:32:21.540 --> 3:32:27.300]  If you don't get vaccinated, you can't come into this, get onto this airplane.
[3:32:27.300 --> 3:32:29.460]  There's nothing to do with freedom.
[3:32:29.460 --> 3:32:30.980]  There's nothing to do with liberty.
[3:32:30.980 --> 3:32:35.620]  You don't have the freedom and the liberty to put other people in jeopardy.
[3:32:35.620 --> 3:32:37.180]  You don't have that.
[3:32:37.180 --> 3:32:39.160]  You have to drive the speed limit.
[3:32:39.160 --> 3:32:41.140]  You have to obey the rules.
[3:32:41.140 --> 3:32:45.180]  Put some rules in place that will demand that people get vaccinated.
[3:32:45.180 --> 3:32:46.180]  Right.
[3:32:46.180 --> 3:32:48.980]  I just go around and say, well, look, it's my personal freedom and my liberty.
[3:32:48.980 --> 3:32:51.860]  I want to go 150 miles an hour if I want to.
[3:32:51.860 --> 3:32:57.260]  Sure you can, but you have to suffer the consequences for it, whether you kill yourself
[3:32:57.260 --> 3:33:01.420]  or you get a citation or your driver's license gets taken away.
[3:33:01.420 --> 3:33:06.700]  You have to have certain rules in a society if we all are going to continue to live and
[3:33:06.700 --> 3:33:07.900]  keep each other alive.
[3:33:07.900 --> 3:33:12.580]  You cannot be that selfish and, quite frankly, that ignorant.
[3:33:12.580 --> 3:33:18.940]  That's just him last night, there's another clip that we played where he says, you shouldn't
[3:33:18.940 --> 3:33:19.940]  be allowed to have food.
[3:33:19.940 --> 3:33:21.700]  You shouldn't be allowed to go to the grocery store.
[3:33:21.700 --> 3:33:22.700]  That was from a night before.
[3:33:22.700 --> 3:33:26.620]  We'll play that coming up next segment, because that's really next level.
[3:33:26.620 --> 3:33:29.900]  We do have a thing called the Nuremberg, a federal and state law.
[3:33:29.900 --> 3:33:31.140]  This is not even FDA approved.
[3:33:31.140 --> 3:33:34.980]  It's got horrible side effects, and now it doesn't even protect you.
[3:33:34.980 --> 3:33:36.980]  It's all a lie.
[3:33:36.980 --> 3:33:39.860]  It's all a lie for them to be able to put in our bodies what they want.
[3:33:39.860 --> 3:33:41.580]  These are terrorists.
[3:33:41.580 --> 3:33:45.940]  These people are literally eugenicists up there now trying to normalize them, so they
[3:33:45.940 --> 3:33:46.940]  got a problem.
[3:33:46.940 --> 3:33:48.340]  Half the public or more hasn't taken it.
[3:33:48.340 --> 3:33:51.540]  How are they going to bully us when they're not even the majority, you see?
[3:33:51.540 --> 3:33:53.340]  So the answer is, get back at the bully's face.
[3:33:53.340 --> 3:33:54.340]  What do you do to a bully?
[3:33:54.340 --> 3:33:57.060]  You say, you can't have food or your kids or leave your house.
[3:33:57.060 --> 3:33:58.780]  Kathleen Stabilia said the same thing.
[3:33:58.780 --> 3:33:59.780]  World leaders are saying it.
[3:33:59.780 --> 3:34:00.700]  Macron said it two weeks ago.
[3:34:00.700 --> 3:34:01.700]  No grocery store.
[3:34:01.700 --> 3:34:03.700]  You shouldn't be allowed to have your kids.
[3:34:03.700 --> 3:34:06.060]  People had riots nationwide over it.
[3:34:06.060 --> 3:34:07.260]  This is the time to get aggressive.
[3:34:07.260 --> 3:34:08.740]  This is the time to say no.
[3:34:08.740 --> 3:34:11.100]  This is the time to go bullhorn these people at their houses.
[3:34:11.100 --> 3:34:12.100]  I mean Don Lemon.
[3:34:12.100 --> 3:34:13.100]  They're the ones that want to make us uncomfortable.
[3:34:13.100 --> 3:34:15.100]  They're the ones that want to push up on our body.
[3:34:15.100 --> 3:34:17.260]  They're the ones that have attacked us first.
[3:34:17.260 --> 3:34:20.500]  We don't physically want to put some deadly thing that grows protein crystals in them
[3:34:20.500 --> 3:34:21.500]  that kills them.
[3:34:21.500 --> 3:34:22.500]  I'm trying to murder them.
[3:34:22.500 --> 3:34:23.500]  I'm trying to murder us.
[3:34:23.500 --> 3:34:29.020]  But we need to find out where Don Lemon goes to work out, where Don Lemon goes to church.
[3:34:29.020 --> 3:34:30.020]  Of course he doesn't.
[3:34:30.020 --> 3:34:31.020]  Where Don Lemon goes.
[3:34:31.020 --> 3:34:34.340]  And we need to go get his face because they want to get all the corporations together
[3:34:34.340 --> 3:34:38.620]  to say if you don't have an ID and a digital pass that we check when you go to a store
[3:34:38.620 --> 3:34:43.020]  or you go to your church or when your car turns on, then we're not going to let you
[3:34:43.020 --> 3:34:45.220]  live and let you have a life.
[3:34:45.220 --> 3:34:49.300]  This is all about the global ID for the global tax and the global order.
[3:34:49.300 --> 3:34:52.100]  And again, just like the idiots that took the deadly shot, they were supposed to be
[3:34:52.100 --> 3:34:53.100]  heroes.
[3:34:53.100 --> 3:34:56.420]  They're the ones now told you've got to still wear a mask and you're the super spreader.
[3:34:56.420 --> 3:34:58.900]  And they go, why would they target their own minions that follow their orders?
[3:34:58.900 --> 3:35:04.060]  Because that's who the abuser abuses is, is the people that follow the orders.
[3:35:04.060 --> 3:35:06.620]  So everybody knows medical experimentation is wrong.
[3:35:06.620 --> 3:35:08.580]  Everybody knows they couldn't approve mRNA.
[3:35:08.580 --> 3:35:09.820]  Everybody knows this doesn't protect you.
[3:35:09.820 --> 3:35:11.540]  Everybody knows Bill Gates wants to kill you.
[3:35:11.540 --> 3:35:13.460]  Everybody knows CNN hates America.
[3:35:13.460 --> 3:35:14.460]  Everybody knows this.
[3:35:14.460 --> 3:35:19.340]  Saudi Arabia has been 20% inoculated, but they said they're better than us.
[3:35:19.340 --> 3:35:24.380]  All over the country, India won't take our shots less than 10% have taken theirs.
[3:35:24.380 --> 3:35:25.780]  China is less inoculated than we are.
[3:35:25.780 --> 3:35:29.140]  But we're told we're bad that America is involved in the whole world, but it's actually the
[3:35:29.140 --> 3:35:31.740]  countries that are almost fully vaccinated that have a little problem.
[3:35:31.740 --> 3:35:32.740]  Those are facts.
[3:35:32.740 --> 3:35:33.740]  That's truth.
[3:35:33.740 --> 3:35:37.900]  You little lying monster, Don Lemon, but Don Lemon is a nobody.
[3:35:37.900 --> 3:35:38.900]  He reads up a teleprompter.
[3:35:38.900 --> 3:35:39.900]  He's a puppet.
[3:35:39.900 --> 3:35:40.900]  He's not a real man.
[3:35:40.900 --> 3:35:41.900]  He's like Pinocchio.
[3:35:41.900 --> 3:35:42.900]  We'll be right back.
[3:35:42.900 --> 3:35:43.900]  We fight these tyrants.
[3:35:43.900 --> 3:35:44.900]  This gets crazier from here.
[3:35:44.900 --> 3:35:45.900]  Resistence is victory.
[3:35:45.900 --> 3:35:46.900]  Submission is death.
[3:35:46.900 --> 3:35:47.900]  ImphoWars.com.

[3:36:50.420 --> 3:36:57.620]  There's one central fact of criminal psychology that criminologists all agree on, that its
[3:36:57.620 --> 3:37:00.700]  criminals are extremely pathological.
[3:37:00.700 --> 3:37:04.620]  Even more the general public, they do the same things over and over again, and criminals
[3:37:04.620 --> 3:37:09.180]  like to commit the same types of crimes over and over again.
[3:37:09.180 --> 3:37:16.580]  Well guess what, it was Anthony Fauci and Eugenist's globalist that ran the rollout
[3:37:16.580 --> 3:37:20.900]  of HIV and the mistreatment of it with AZT and other chemicals that actually killed more
[3:37:20.900 --> 3:37:26.780]  people than HIV and they were the ones involved in viral research of viruses that would actually
[3:37:26.780 --> 3:37:31.260]  go attack the T lymphocytes in the body and create autoimmune disorders.
[3:37:31.260 --> 3:37:36.620]  The problem for them was the viruses would then break down and would be non-lethal down
[3:37:36.620 --> 3:37:37.620]  the road.
[3:37:37.620 --> 3:37:41.700]  That's why they need to roll out the COVID-19 and the vaccine, because now they admit the
[3:37:41.700 --> 3:37:46.980]  COVID-19 vaccine destroys your immune system, basically giving you the equivalent of HIV.
[3:37:46.980 --> 3:37:50.380]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:37:50.380 --> 3:37:54.740]  I preach about the dangers of cell phones all day long because they're supercomputers
[3:37:54.740 --> 3:37:59.020]  controlled by big tech that are spying on us everywhere we go and what we do, but because
[3:37:59.020 --> 3:38:03.260]  they have great cameras and great recording systems and great ways to communicate, I still
[3:38:03.260 --> 3:38:08.020]  have one because this Trojan horse, this Promethean fire, has a lot of power, but when I'm not
[3:38:08.020 --> 3:38:14.380]  using it, I lock it up in a high quality Faraday cage, a privacy pocket at infowarstore.com.
[3:38:14.380 --> 3:38:18.660]  We finally got them back in stock, the highest rated, they fit almost all types of androids

[3:38:38.740 --> 3:38:39.740]  really are.

[3:39:53.580 --> 3:40:19.580]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:40:19.580 --> 3:40:38.980]  Hi, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. It's the final segment here and we had played
[3:40:38.980 --> 3:40:42.660]  last night's Don Lemon where he said a lot of horrible things. He's just a standard talking
[3:40:42.660 --> 3:40:47.500]  boy, but I want to play you the night before last. This is short clip in case new listeners
[3:40:47.500 --> 3:40:52.300]  tune in and I think I'm making this up. Same thing McCron said in France, you can't go
[3:40:52.300 --> 3:40:55.820]  to the grocery store, you can't have a job, which means starved to death. This is called
[3:40:55.820 --> 3:41:01.060]  seeds total war. Here's a clip of it.
[3:41:01.060 --> 3:41:04.860]  I don't know. I'm sure a lot of people are not going to agree with this, but don't get
[3:41:04.860 --> 3:41:09.260]  the vaccine. You can't go to the supermarket. Don't have the vaccine. You don't show it.
[3:41:09.260 --> 3:41:15.340]  Can't go to the ballgame. Don't have the vaccine. Can't go to work. You don't have the vaccine.
[3:41:15.340 --> 3:41:20.580]  They come here. No shirt, no shoes, no service. That's what I think we should be right now.
[3:41:20.580 --> 3:41:24.500]  That's it up with this tyrant. So again, let's just say the vaccine works and it's as good
[3:41:24.500 --> 3:41:27.540]  as pumpkin pie or mother's book, which we know it isn't, but Bill Gates gave it to us
[3:41:27.540 --> 3:41:32.460]  because he loves us. He's changed his mind. I want to say it was him. Even though he's
[3:41:32.460 --> 3:41:36.900]  been caught in 20 plus countries, injecting people with steroids poison and killing Africans
[3:41:36.900 --> 3:41:40.180]  and Indians and he's been banned in those countries. It doesn't matter. We've been
[3:41:40.180 --> 3:41:45.780]  banned in Kenya. It doesn't matter if he's banned in India. It's okay. He's a good teller.
[3:41:45.780 --> 3:41:50.140]  He wants you to take a shot. Let's just say the shot's good. The world ID and your medical
[3:41:50.140 --> 3:41:54.820]  records and any bar you go in or restaurant or a gym or hotel wanting to see your status
[3:41:54.820 --> 3:41:59.300]  and then just on the paper, once they have like six places for the shots, you're going
[3:41:59.300 --> 3:42:02.500]  to get for COVID. They said a year and a half ago, it'll take multiple shots. It ain't
[3:42:02.500 --> 3:42:08.060]  going to work. They had this all prepared. So again, they want you to be a chump and
[3:42:08.060 --> 3:42:14.740]  pretend you're cool. So the answer is reaching out to all these leftists and explain to them,
[3:42:14.740 --> 3:42:20.540]  this is about it. And this is not partisan and use those clips of when the Democrats,
[3:42:20.540 --> 3:42:25.500]  when Trump was trying to work speed it, because he got hoodwinked or like, sir, we'll never
[3:42:25.500 --> 3:42:29.780]  reopen the economy for two years. He goes, well, kill the economy. Well, there's no vaccine.
[3:42:29.780 --> 3:42:32.740]  Then they came to him and said, well, actually, sir, they can get it ready quicker than that.
[3:42:32.740 --> 3:42:39.180]  They set Trump up. We get it. We know moving past that. The point is, is now we're here
[3:42:39.180 --> 3:42:42.740]  and they don't work. They're fraud. They're actually causing a majority of illnesses.
[3:42:42.740 --> 3:42:47.580]  South sheet is liable. Gates is liable. This is a perfect market where it never works.
[3:42:47.580 --> 3:42:51.300]  You got to have more, more, more. They're always getting it on record. It's time for
[3:42:51.300 --> 3:42:56.340]  them to go to prison because they're now blaming on vaccine. They're now blaming UNI. They're
[3:42:56.340 --> 3:43:00.580]  now coming after us. They're blaming the vaccinated. This is a way to say all humans are racist
[3:43:00.580 --> 3:43:05.580]  and evil and bad. Do what we say. All humans are poisonous and have evil things inside
[3:43:05.580 --> 3:43:09.740]  of you. Wear a mask. You're dirty. You're evil, teaching us to hate ourselves, teaching
[3:43:09.740 --> 3:43:13.660]  us to be depopulated. This is their globalist religion. So we decided then that this is
[3:43:13.660 --> 3:43:20.980]  all true. You go first, knowing about their systems, knowing about their control is how
[3:43:20.980 --> 3:43:25.340]  we win the war against them. Understanding the new world order, you then understand
[3:43:25.340 --> 3:43:29.220]  the future because they're in control of the planet. That is incredibly valuable. Even
[3:43:29.220 --> 3:43:33.300]  if you were a sociopath, just from a stock market position. And as the public figures
[3:43:33.300 --> 3:43:38.260]  out that people that are experts on the new world order are the most valuable information
[3:43:38.260 --> 3:43:43.020]  conduits out there, the globalists don't give the general public all these secrets. They
[3:43:43.020 --> 3:43:47.780]  communicate in the CFR and through white papers. Most of it classified a lot of it public.
[3:43:47.780 --> 3:43:51.780]  So if you have a deep knowledge of it, you're basically a globalist. You're just not with
[3:43:51.780 --> 3:43:56.220]  them. And to win any war, they'll tell you, get in the mind of your enemy. Think like
[3:43:56.220 --> 3:44:01.860]  that's your enemy. Understand your enemy. Immerse yourself in the enemy. I've done that. And
[3:44:01.860 --> 3:44:06.220]  that's why in full wars, there's such a brain trust and so key and so critical. And that's
[3:44:06.220 --> 3:44:10.020]  why I'm willing to lose my life at this fight because I know as I up the ante, they're going
[3:44:10.020 --> 3:44:14.540]  to come after me. That's okay. Because in the end, they must lose. They must fail.
[3:44:14.540 --> 3:44:17.700]  Where all of humanity is going to be lost. And I look at my four-year-old daughter.
[3:44:17.700 --> 3:44:21.940]  Look at how innocent she is. I'm not going to let them put her into this world they're
[3:44:21.940 --> 3:44:28.100]  trying to build. I have a responsibility before God to do it. I just want to thank the listeners
[3:44:28.100 --> 3:44:33.740]  and viewers and the in full wars family and this great crew that have kept us in attack
[3:44:33.740 --> 3:44:37.940]  formation to fight these people because that's my great dream. That's my great focus. That
[3:44:37.940 --> 3:44:41.940]  is everything I want to do is just give everything I've got to this fight because it's a human
[3:44:41.940 --> 3:44:45.940]  fight. Our ancestors fought to survive. We're fighting to survive. This is our animating
[3:44:45.940 --> 3:44:51.300]  contest. This is our greatest moment. And our chance to shine before God and man and
[3:44:51.300 --> 3:44:56.700]  to do the right thing. So it's just an incredible time to be alive. And you see people like
[3:44:56.700 --> 3:45:00.300]  Matt Gaetz being set up by the FBI and others going through the fire now, learning how really
[3:45:00.300 --> 3:45:04.620]  evil it is not being naive anymore. As the enemy pressures, they wake up and Matt Gaetz
[3:45:04.620 --> 3:45:09.340]  talking about the FBI setting up fake criminal groups and it's provocaturing malicious and
[3:45:09.340 --> 3:45:15.140]  provocaturing the Capitol. It's all coming out. Here's Matt Gaetz.
[3:45:15.140 --> 3:45:21.300]  Every day in America people are locked in prison. It's not every day that people are locked
[3:45:21.300 --> 3:45:26.300]  out of a prison, which is what happened to multiple members of Congress today. We have
[3:45:26.300 --> 3:45:32.020]  two principal responsibilities to appropriate funds and to conduct oversight. How does the
[3:45:32.020 --> 3:45:37.900]  Biden administration expect us to participate in the representative republic when they deprive
[3:45:37.900 --> 3:45:44.820]  us of access to information that would inform our oversight work and our appropriations decisions?
[3:45:44.820 --> 3:45:50.020]  The questions we've asked have gone unanswered for months and they fall into two principal
[3:45:50.020 --> 3:45:55.820]  categories. First, are there defendants as a consequence of their conduct on January
[3:45:55.820 --> 3:46:03.260]  6th being deprived of access to potentially exculpatory evidence? We have seen that the
[3:46:03.260 --> 3:46:10.620]  FBI has a history of animating criminal conduct. That is precisely what happened in Michigan
[3:46:10.620 --> 3:46:16.500]  and it may be what happened on January 6th as well. To answer that question we need access
[3:46:16.500 --> 3:46:21.980]  to the 14,000 hours of videos that Congressman Gosar has continuously called for.
[3:46:21.980 --> 3:46:26.780]  To answer that question, to get that evidence, we sought a meeting with the Attorney General.
[3:46:26.780 --> 3:46:31.580]  We went to the Department of Justice and we weren't even allowed in the lobby to have
[3:46:31.580 --> 3:46:36.820]  a meeting with an attorney general who still to this day has not shown up for an oversight
[3:46:36.820 --> 3:46:41.420]  hearing before the oversight committee or the House Judiciary Committee. What is Merritt
[3:46:41.420 --> 3:46:48.740]  Garland hiding? The second category of concerns deals with the specific treatment of detainees.
[3:46:48.740 --> 3:46:54.060]  To get answers, we did what members of Congress normally do. We showed up at the facility
[3:46:54.060 --> 3:46:59.740]  and sought a tour. This happens for Republicans under Democrat administrations. It happened
[3:46:59.740 --> 3:47:05.780]  for Democrats under Republican administrations and now there is an unprecedented effort to
[3:47:05.780 --> 3:47:11.220]  deny members of Congress information that relates to criminal cases and that relates
[3:47:11.220 --> 3:47:17.980]  to the treatment of people that are held. Ladies and gentlemen, this is what tyranny
[3:47:17.980 --> 3:47:22.060]  looks like. Congress has oversight. They get into any prison they want. They get into any
[3:47:22.060 --> 3:47:25.620]  underground base they want. They're supposedly to get into the nuclear silos and everything
[3:47:25.620 --> 3:47:30.460]  but they can't go to that place where 500 plus, mainly innocent people and I mean those
[3:47:30.460 --> 3:47:33.820]  are even there for crapping on the table or fighting with a cop. They'd already be out
[3:47:33.820 --> 3:47:39.740]  on bond normally in two days but no because their patriots are being tortured in there
[3:47:39.740 --> 3:47:43.980]  because they also don't want people to get out who got provocateur by sets and that's
[3:47:43.980 --> 3:47:47.420]  what the few people that have gotten to the lawyers are saying is, I was set up, I was
[3:47:47.420 --> 3:47:51.300]  sent in, I was told Q was in command, I was told I was in this group, I was told that
[3:47:51.300 --> 3:47:56.180]  group, we don't anti lead folks in and now they want to put us all in these prisons.
[3:47:56.180 --> 3:48:00.940]  It's so dangerous, it's so illegal, it's so out of control. All right, the war room
[3:48:00.940 --> 3:48:04.980]  is coming up and I'm not sure if it's Harrison Smith, I'm not sure if it's Owen Schwerer
[3:48:04.980 --> 3:48:07.580]  hosting it but I'm sure it'll be informative and powerful and they're going to have open
[3:48:07.580 --> 3:48:12.660]  phones. A lot of open phones this next week. Now we're doing some extra live broadcasts
[3:48:12.660 --> 3:48:16.180]  as well. We just take calls from people that have taken the inoculation so they can tell
[3:48:16.180 --> 3:48:20.820]  their first-hand account. Something the enemy doesn't want is true open lines, unfiltered
[3:48:20.820 --> 3:48:25.300]  info or such a valuable network in the fight against tyranny. So just thanks for letting
[3:48:25.300 --> 3:48:30.660]  it continue on. We've seen it for a week and then again for another week, I will end 100%
[3:48:30.660 --> 3:48:35.260]  on Sunday night, 10% off all the high-quality food right now the last decade. It's really
[3:48:35.260 --> 3:48:41.180]  good that it's very low-cost, ready to ship to you, 10% off, infoorstore.com, the full
[3:48:41.180 --> 3:48:47.180]  catalog of my Patriots supply, 10% off, only place you're going to get that is infoorstore.com
[3:48:47.180 --> 3:48:51.460]  and that also funds our operation on 361. You need to get prepared and then you also
[3:48:51.460 --> 3:48:57.140]  go to mypilla.com and put in promo code Alex, whether it's the sheets or the pillows or
[3:48:57.140 --> 3:49:04.140]  the great beds he's got or the dog beds, the cat beds, the towels, everything. And almost
[3:49:04.140 --> 3:49:07.820]  all the cotton's made in America. The Giza sheets are from African cotton, but put together
[3:49:07.820 --> 3:49:14.940]  here it's great cotton. That is famous Egyptian cotton. So it's all there at infoorstore.com.
[3:49:14.940 --> 3:49:20.380]  We'll find all of our products. We're running out of the iodine sold out of the spray bottles.
[3:49:20.380 --> 3:49:24.700]  We have it's 40% off in the dropper bottles, exact same deprecrystal iodine. That's going
[3:49:24.700 --> 3:49:28.020]  to sell out very soon. I want to thank you all for your support. These are great products
[3:49:28.020 --> 3:49:31.460]  you need. These stressful times get stuck to it while you can. There's all the crazy
[3:49:31.460 --> 3:49:35.300]  stuff going on. I don't know how long we'll be on the air. Did anybody question the election?
[3:49:35.300 --> 3:49:39.420]  Anybody that's a question lockdowns is a terrorist. They're getting false flags ready. So we're
[3:49:39.420 --> 3:49:42.940]  trying to build our war chest up right now to be able to operate even if funds aren't
[3:49:42.940 --> 3:49:49.460]  coming in for a while. This is serious war. It's all in God's hands, but it's up to us
[3:49:49.460 --> 3:49:53.780]  to get the word out so that others have a choice to make. God warns everybody. So it's
[3:49:53.780 --> 3:49:58.380]  your job to help warn people. God's working for you. God's working for me. I know that's
[3:49:58.380 --> 3:50:03.020]  my mission. I get really stressed out. God puts a hand on my shoulder. There's always
[3:50:03.020 --> 3:50:05.820]  spirit in this list and it's not your job to fix all this. It's your job to tell the
[3:50:05.820 --> 3:50:09.380]  truth and stand up and you do the right thing. And then people have a choice. And that's
[3:50:09.380 --> 3:50:15.940]  what this is. This is a big test and the global true losers. We're the winners and we're going
[3:50:15.940 --> 3:50:19.820]  to win this together. All right. The war room is coming up right now and then I'll be back
[3:50:19.820 --> 3:50:25.260]  this Sunday, Lord willing, 4 to 6 p.m. with the Sunday 5 edition. You got some big guests
[3:50:25.260 --> 3:50:28.700]  coming up Sunday, big guests this next week. Thank you all. I love you all. I love the
[3:50:28.700 --> 3:50:32.580]  crew. Thank you so much. And I will see you soon in FullWars.com. Tomorrow's news today.
[3:50:32.580 --> 3:50:50.780]  Everyone out, Sherlock's Waing.
