[00:00.000 --> 00:11.600]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.600 --> 00:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.160 --> 00:31.280]  Texas Alex Jones it is the final day of November 2009 climate date is continuing
[00:31.280 --> 00:38.320]  to explode across newspaper front pages across the globe television is
[00:38.320 --> 00:43.480]  attempting a predominantly to spin it or not even cover it we've had a horrible
[00:43.480 --> 00:48.640]  mass shooting execution style of four police officers and a suburb of Seattle
[00:48.640 --> 00:58.520]  Washington and I've been noticing a trend here with these police shootings in
[00:58.520 --> 01:03.360]  fact I'm gonna be breaking that down an angle that no one has covered that no
[01:03.360 --> 01:07.800]  one has noticed but I'm sure the police have noticed it but they don't want to
[01:07.800 --> 01:12.120]  be politically incorrect and talk about it so we're gonna be discussing that as
[01:12.120 --> 01:18.480]  well today huge developments in the Dubai default with that state finance
[01:18.480 --> 01:25.080]  development fund of 14 billion pounds sending shockwaves through global
[01:25.080 --> 01:30.320]  markets and we're also going to have open phones today no guest today I'm
[01:30.320 --> 01:35.560]  gonna play some clips of my live Charlie Sheen interview yesterday and we're
[01:35.560 --> 01:39.080]  also gonna play some clips from Lord Christopher Monkton's incredible
[01:39.080 --> 01:43.800]  interview live here on Friday we'll be playing short clips of that throughout
[01:43.800 --> 01:48.280]  the radio broadcast today and I'm going to play once we go live at prison
[01:48.280 --> 01:52.920]  planet TV simulcasting with the radio show I'm gonna play in full the winter
[01:52.920 --> 01:57.440]  of the 20 minutes with the president contest and I may be announcing second
[01:57.440 --> 02:02.280]  and third place today or tomorrow to be honest with you for two weeks I've been
[02:02.280 --> 02:05.360]  looking because I'm judging second and third place Charlie judged first place
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.600]  which was the easy part and I'm still juggling I'm still trying to decide it
[02:09.600 --> 02:14.240]  it's heart-rending and I'm chiming in with some of my staff who they think
[02:14.240 --> 02:17.560]  should win because I'm really having trouble being decisive here because
[02:17.560 --> 02:22.080]  there's so many good ones that should get second or third place so that is
[02:22.080 --> 02:28.640]  coming up today as well when Dave Mustaine founder of mega death former
[02:28.640 --> 02:33.200]  member of course of Metallica was on with us a month and a half ago he talked
[02:33.200 --> 02:38.240]  about how he named his new album in the game off of my film in game blueprint
[02:38.240 --> 02:43.880]  for global enslavement wasn't Dave's first visit with us here on air but he
[02:43.880 --> 02:47.960]  really opened up and it was an amazing interview that's been written about on
[02:47.960 --> 02:53.280]  a lot of big music publications and he said when I come to Texas in December
[02:53.280 --> 02:59.680]  I'd like to hook up and then Craig Sadler one of the producers here in the
[02:59.680 --> 03:03.800]  office pointed out he's last week he said you know next week is when Dave
[03:03.800 --> 03:07.560]  Mustaine's in town and I scrambled sent an email but they were already on the
[03:07.560 --> 03:11.120]  road and we hadn't heard back from them since Friday when we first thought
[03:11.120 --> 03:15.600]  about this so I sent more emails this morning and I said you know what I'm
[03:15.600 --> 03:19.560]  just gonna call because I've got Dave's cell phone and his assistant cell phone
[03:19.560 --> 03:23.760]  but I called his assistant cell phone they're in Corpus Christi this is right
[03:23.760 --> 03:28.760]  before airtime and he goes here let me just wake Dave up and I'm like no no so
[03:28.760 --> 03:34.520]  he wakes Dave Mustaine up Dave gets on the phone and says yeah yeah call me back
[03:34.520 --> 03:39.000]  later day after I wake up but it should be good to do an interview in Dallas I
[03:39.000 --> 03:42.440]  gotta check the schedule count on that but if not I'll come on via the phone

[07:11.920 --> 07:16.200]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:16.200 --> 07:20.560]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:20.560 --> 07:24.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:24.640 --> 07:29.200]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:29.200 --> 07:33.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:33.320 --> 07:37.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[08:49.360 --> 08:53.360]  we dance like marionettes
[08:53.360 --> 08:58.360]  swaying to the symphony of destruction
[08:58.360 --> 09:03.360]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central standard time
[09:03.360 --> 09:08.360]  we are here live
[09:12.360 --> 09:17.360]  12 noon to 4 p.m. eastern
[09:17.360 --> 09:34.360]  before the head explodes
[09:34.360 --> 09:40.360]  world government is here
[09:40.360 --> 09:49.360]  the battle against the globalist has now begun
[09:49.360 --> 09:56.360]  the awakening is accelerating
[09:56.360 --> 10:05.360]  the population of the planet is rising to meet the threat of the new world order
[10:05.360 --> 10:13.360]  swaying to the symphony of destruction
[10:13.360 --> 10:19.360]  OK here's the deal I can get into the latest climate gate huge developments I can get
[10:19.360 --> 10:25.360]  into the terrible murder execution style of four police officers in Washington state
[10:25.360 --> 10:31.360]  in a suburb of Seattle the financial information it's all of great import but I
[10:31.360 --> 10:35.360]  know listeners are chomping at the bit to talk about the Charlie sheen live
[10:35.360 --> 10:39.360]  interview yesterday I know listeners are chomping at the bit to talk about the
[10:39.360 --> 10:43.360]  Ventura interview people are chomping at the bit to discuss the Lord Moncton
[10:43.360 --> 10:49.360]  interview live Friday for over an hour power packed info calling for Al Gore's
[10:49.360 --> 10:55.360]  arrest and the complete abolishment of the United Nations I know listeners are
[10:55.360 --> 11:01.360]  chomping at the bit to talk about the Dubai default of 14 billion pounds just to begin
[11:01.360 --> 11:07.360]  with the plunging stock markets
[11:07.360 --> 11:13.360]  but first we will take your phone calls I will tell you this
[11:13.360 --> 11:19.360]  I noticed a trend immediately yesterday when doing an hour or so of research on
[11:19.360 --> 11:25.360]  and I said shootings because there's police shootings going on all over the
[11:25.360 --> 11:31.360]  country a lot of police are being killed and killed in large numbers at one time
[11:31.360 --> 11:37.360]  and I noticed something immediately in this trend that no one dare point out
[11:37.360 --> 11:45.360]  well we point out the truth no matter where it leads us we let the chips fall
[11:45.360 --> 11:51.360]  where they may we play the hand that reality deals us
[11:51.360 --> 11:55.360]  and so coming up later in the hour I'm going to be breaking that down they do
[11:55.360 --> 11:59.360]  have the individual surrounded in the neighborhood the main suspect and we're
[11:59.360 --> 12:08.360]  going to be breaking that down coming up Maurice Clemens is the main suspect
[12:08.360 --> 12:12.360]  they're saying and may have been wounded that's how they were able to track him so
[12:12.360 --> 12:18.360]  that is coming up and just giant developments on the climate gate
[12:18.360 --> 12:25.360]  front now seven days away from the kickoff of Copenhagen the open founding
[12:25.360 --> 12:31.360]  complete public announcement of the world government the coming out party of
[12:31.360 --> 12:37.360]  these ghouls so that is coming up as well today no guest today have a lot of
[12:37.360 --> 12:42.360]  very informative groundbreaking interviews coming up this week I will just
[12:42.360 --> 12:47.360]  leave it at that for everyone the toll free number to join us and I want to take
[12:47.360 --> 12:51.360]  first-time calls at least in this first hour a lot of people say they can never
[12:51.360 --> 13:02.360]  get in when you hear a caller hang up that's your chance to call in 1-800-259-9231-1800-259-9231
[13:02.360 --> 13:08.360]  we will get you up and on the air right now let's go ahead and go to Mike in
[13:08.360 --> 13:12.360]  Pennsylvania Mike you're on the air hey Alex thanks for having me appreciate
[13:12.360 --> 13:17.360]  everything you do you bet bro hey uh kind of a two-part kind of question one
[13:17.360 --> 13:23.360]  about the climate gate one about the economy do you think when Obama will
[13:23.360 --> 13:29.360]  sign the Copenhagen Treaty account of all the emails and whatnot that has come
[13:29.360 --> 13:34.360]  out and is for the economy question do you think that there are just basically
[13:34.360 --> 13:38.360]  propping the economy up to get through the holiday to drain all the rest of the
[13:38.360 --> 13:45.360]  blood out of the slaves before they pull the rug out from under us so to speak
[13:45.360 --> 13:52.360]  say that again do you think that the powers to be are basically you know
[13:52.360 --> 13:56.360]  inflating the stock market keeping things afloat the best they can with their lives
[13:56.360 --> 14:00.360]  right now until after the Christmas holiday and everybody spends every you
[14:00.360 --> 14:06.360]  know last cent they have just to you know drain the more blood out of us yes
[14:06.360 --> 14:12.360]  yes they tell us revive the economy by going into debt buying fruit pies and
[14:12.360 --> 14:21.360]  ties and bottles of old old crow and wild turkey whiskey and certainly the real
[14:21.360 --> 14:28.360]  economy has between a 20 and a 22% unemployment rate even CNBC says it's
[14:28.360 --> 14:35.360]  over 17% the White House says 10.2 but over 20 is depressionary so the real
[14:35.360 --> 14:41.360]  economy is just spiraling downward in a in a death rattle towards the bottomless
[14:41.360 --> 14:47.360]  abyss while the banks register record profits off the crises they engineered
[14:47.360 --> 14:52.360]  and the global warming takeover tax that they wrote and so yes I agree with you
[14:52.360 --> 14:57.360]  that they want to get their expansion of the Afghan war announced they want to
[14:57.360 --> 15:01.360]  get another banker bailout ram through they want to get more of their
[15:01.360 --> 15:07.360]  north com paramilitary police force in place before they really dropped the
[15:07.360 --> 15:11.360]  hammer and announced that we're officially in a depression they're already
[15:11.360 --> 15:16.360]  hinting at that by saying a double dip recession which there's no such thing as
[15:16.360 --> 15:22.360]  a double dip recession but three-quarters of non growth is a recession
[15:22.360 --> 15:28.360]  we're now even with cooked books they put out several years into no growth in
[15:28.360 --> 15:33.360]  the economy and I mean you talked anybody you know it's it's most people I
[15:33.360 --> 15:37.360]  know have lost their jobs or have had their hours cut or their pay cut people
[15:37.360 --> 15:42.360]  are going banker up left and right the real estate crisis is only ripening
[15:42.360 --> 15:47.360]  right now with the situation with commercial real estate and so yes that's
[15:47.360 --> 15:54.360]  a very very important question and point you make Mike the Copenhagen Treaty
[15:54.360 --> 15:58.360]  and everything would kind of coincide with that that you know with you know
[15:58.360 --> 16:04.360]  new currency and and all of that the currency is going to be cashless it's
[16:04.360 --> 16:08.360]  a bank-to-bank system where the banks just announced they just issue their own
[16:08.360 --> 16:14.360]  fiat cashless system above the governments that would basically just be
[16:14.360 --> 16:18.360]  between the banks it wouldn't be yes but they've got a global standardization
[16:18.360 --> 16:22.360]  system where you're going to thumb print and face scan it's already going on
[16:22.360 --> 16:27.360]  most people just aren't aware of it to buy and sell so we'll still have our
[16:27.360 --> 16:31.360]  regional and national currencies and there'll be even private corporate
[16:31.360 --> 16:37.360]  currencies being issued but they'll all be registered and run to the same grid
[16:37.360 --> 16:40.360]  well we're going to keep track of all that I'm sure they got their way though
[16:40.360 --> 16:45.360]  computers but yeah just to hold us down more
[16:45.360 --> 16:50.360]  what's the name of the game just thank you sir they want to bankrupt us so they
[16:50.360 --> 16:55.360]  can social engineer us that's their own words they want us fully bankrupted by
[16:55.360 --> 17:00.360]  design that is morey strong and the heads of the UN all on record they are
[17:00.360 --> 17:04.360]  eugenicist and if you're a new listener and you don't know what eugenics is
[17:04.360 --> 17:08.360]  and you don't know what social engineering is you better find out fast
[17:08.360 --> 17:12.360]  because that's what makes the world go around under the system
[17:12.360 --> 17:17.360]  let's go ahead and talk to Sean in Texas Sean you're on the year
[17:17.360 --> 17:22.360]  hey Alex man you're awesome been listening to you for about two years now
[17:22.360 --> 17:25.360]  thought I'd never call you but I'm glad to be on the show
[17:25.360 --> 17:30.360]  my thing is I was looking at seeing and I just got about 30 minutes ago
[17:30.360 --> 17:34.360]  and I was looking at seeing and they were talking about Obama with Afghanistan
[17:34.360 --> 17:39.360]  he's going to Afghanistan so now like 35,000 troops, 5,000 troops from NATO
[17:39.360 --> 17:44.360]  and then 30,000 of our troops and he's reaching out to other world leaders
[17:44.360 --> 17:50.360]  that's right in fact I have a Russia Today newscast where Russia warms to the
[17:50.360 --> 17:54.360]  NATO alliance and admits they're supplying hundreds of helicopters
[17:54.360 --> 17:59.360]  hundreds and hundreds of armored vehicles and hundreds and hundreds now
[17:59.360 --> 18:07.360]  reaching into the thousands of advisors, former KGB, former Spitznets
[18:07.360 --> 18:12.360]  special forces helping NATO which means Russia has been let in on a cut of the
[18:12.360 --> 18:15.360]  opium cash this is just thoroughly disgusting
[18:15.360 --> 18:25.360]  340,000 coalition slash NATO slash US slash Russian slash
[18:25.360 --> 18:31.360]  Afghan trained forces 12 to 1 against the supposed Taliban
[18:31.360 --> 18:35.360]  now the Taliban is admittedly on the CIA payroll that's come out in hundreds of
[18:35.360 --> 18:38.360]  mainstream reports they're talking about the few Taliban groups not paying their
[18:38.360 --> 18:44.360]  cut in opium money so that this is all a big opium war over the 500 billion a year
[18:44.360 --> 18:49.360]  and that's the raw numbers they're they're able to fractionally reserve
[18:49.360 --> 18:53.360]  leverage that to at least five trillion that's a conservative number so the
[18:53.360 --> 18:58.360]  five trillion dollar a year war doesn't matter if Afghanistan costs 300, 400,
[18:58.360 --> 19:03.360]  500 billion a year that's just taxpayer subsidized money to the drug cartels
[19:03.360 --> 19:09.360]  IE the big central banks but yes by distracting in the last ten months
[19:09.360 --> 19:12.360]  saying he was going to decide on whether or not to send more US troops
[19:12.360 --> 19:17.360]  he's already sent 40,000 troops in smaller increments since he got into
[19:17.360 --> 19:23.360]  office now he's saying 30 to 40,000 more and of course the peacenix or
[19:23.360 --> 19:27.360]  code pink is hailing the war now they love war I mean it's just all completely
[19:27.360 --> 19:30.360]  staged and we knew that would happen we knew he was a warmonger because he's
[19:30.360 --> 19:34.360]  an absolute puppet his agenda is the new world order agenda

[24:07.360 --> 24:12.360]  we are back live continually taking your phone calls
[24:12.360 --> 24:21.360]  we're out the sour into the next to answer Sean's question the Amaro has
[24:21.360 --> 24:28.360]  gotten attention in the last decade because in multiple articles and
[24:28.360 --> 24:33.360]  financial publications like money and fortune and the financial times of
[24:33.360 --> 24:41.360]  London central bankers have talked about a regional Amaro currency I mean back
[24:41.360 --> 24:46.360]  in 1989 money magazine talked about a global currency called the phoenix but
[24:46.360 --> 24:51.360]  all of that is really a distraction sure you can read the SPP security
[24:51.360 --> 24:56.360]  prosperity partnership North American Union documents that judicial watch
[24:56.360 --> 25:03.360]  sued and got from 2006 2007 and they talk in there about a North American
[25:03.360 --> 25:09.360]  currency but the more I study this I realize that's all the distraction we
[25:09.360 --> 25:14.360]  already have a global treaty with the UN the United States does in 2000 for a
[25:14.360 --> 25:19.360]  global standardization for a cashless system you will still have cash but
[25:19.360 --> 25:24.360]  they have strips in them with ID numbers that will track every purchase you make
[25:24.360 --> 25:30.360]  everything you do and under national and international sales taxes and carbon
[25:30.360 --> 25:34.360]  footprint taxes is now been publicly proposed they always propose years
[25:34.360 --> 25:42.360]  they set it up what they're already doing to chronicle your purchases what you
[25:42.360 --> 25:47.360]  eat where you go what you do how you travel how much fuel you buy how many
[25:47.360 --> 25:53.360]  aircraft trips you take and then when you exhaust your carbon credits for the
[25:53.360 --> 25:57.360]  year which they'll always lower each year you then start paying taxes directly
[25:57.360 --> 26:02.360]  to the IMF it's been chosen as the main holding company for private central
[26:02.360 --> 26:05.360]  banks the quasi-government front to which you'll pay your taxes and that's what's
[26:05.360 --> 26:14.360]  happening in Copenhagen in t-minus seven days that's what Van Rompuy I've been
[26:14.360 --> 26:18.360]  mispronouncing it is Van Rompuy because I saw them in the British parliament
[26:18.360 --> 26:28.360]  calling Van Rompuy it's Van Rompuy the new head of the European Union admits
[26:28.360 --> 26:33.360]  global governance that the key to it is the global carbon tax so you see
[26:33.360 --> 26:38.360]  currency is taxes currency is debt in the banker system and so you have SDRs
[26:38.360 --> 26:42.360]  and other cashless transfers between private central banks and they're
[26:42.360 --> 26:46.360]  simply stating that they will directly tax populations through IMF and World
[26:46.360 --> 26:52.360]  Bank payments from the West through the Tobin tax on money transfers and stock
[26:52.360 --> 26:58.360]  transfers and derivatives speculation through wellhead taxes through carbon
[26:58.360 --> 27:04.360]  taxes and so you'll still have the dollar and you'll still have the euro and
[27:04.360 --> 27:08.360]  you'll still have the Asian Pacific Union's currency they're talking about
[27:08.360 --> 27:14.360]  so yes they're going to move away from national currencies and into euro
[27:14.360 --> 27:23.360] ized currencies where say the Mediterranean or Africa will peg their
[27:23.360 --> 27:29.360]  standard to that currency and whereas the Caribbean and some Pacific areas
[27:29.360 --> 27:34.360]  in Latin America will be dollarized the globalists still want to have
[27:34.360 --> 27:37.360]  currencies to compete with each other even though they control the system
[27:37.360 --> 27:41.360]  because then they can engage in currency manipulations and carry trades and
[27:41.360 --> 27:46.360]  this gets into the economics of currency speculation and manipulation
[27:46.360 --> 27:51.360]  because they're the insiders they know where to invest how to run the casino
[27:51.360 --> 27:54.360]  then the general public invest in the casino through their pension funds to
[27:54.360 --> 28:00.360]  the stock market and gets ripped off so they're just consolidating their
[28:00.360 --> 28:07.360]  control let's go ahead and take a call from Brandon in Canada Brandon you're
[28:07.360 --> 28:13.360]  on the air hey Alex God bless you thanks for the work you do thank you caller
[28:13.360 --> 28:18.360]  go ahead all right I just wanted to talk to you about just some information I
[28:18.360 --> 28:22.360]  don't know if you know this about the I live here in Victoria and I wanted to
[28:22.360 --> 28:26.360]  bring some information to you about the Olympics I found out they've announced
[28:26.360 --> 28:31.360]  that officially they're calling it martial law and Amy Goodman was trying to
[28:31.360 --> 28:34.360]  travel up there for a book signing and they interrogated her if she was going
[28:34.360 --> 28:39.360]  to be a part of this political criticism of the government and threatened to
[28:39.360 --> 28:44.360]  not let her in I'm sorry I'm being obnoxious go ahead yeah that's right
[28:44.360 --> 28:49.360]  yeah it's funny I heard all these things where they're late I actually took
[28:49.360 --> 28:54.360]  place in that protest you you put a link up about that protest I took place in
[28:54.360 --> 28:59.360]  that protest where they're labeling everybody as terrorists now that are
[28:59.360 --> 29:04.360]  there but the interesting thing is is that what they're doing is completely
[29:04.360 --> 29:08.360]  corrupt and I don't think a lot of information is out there I mean number
[29:08.360 --> 29:12.360]  one they're planning on bringing all of the homeless people from I mean this is
[29:12.360 --> 29:15.360]  already in the news and everything everybody knows this they're planning
[29:15.360 --> 29:19.360]  on bringing the people from that live on the streets in Vancouver bringing them
[29:19.360 --> 29:24.360]  over on a boat like putting them basically by force putting them in little
[29:24.360 --> 29:29.360]  cells here in the on the island in Victoria yes stay there stay there I am
[29:29.360 --> 29:34.360]  aware of this and and we've all been so marinated in classical tyranny that I
[29:34.360 --> 29:39.360]  don't even get upset about this now when I read it any big G20 event Olympics
[29:39.360 --> 29:44.360]  event any type of event these are used as drills to practice federalization
[29:44.360 --> 29:51.360]  and internationalization of cities regions and countries stay there we're on

[35:29.360 --> 35:34.200]  boats get rummaged through. And I mean, it's worse than, I've talked to people who used
[35:34.200 --> 35:38.640]  to travel to the old Soviet Union, reporters and people, and they say going into Canada
[35:38.640 --> 35:43.040]  is worse than the type of stuff that would happen in the seventies and eighties in the
[35:43.040 --> 35:50.720]  Soviet Union, which was clear tyranny. In fact, we might just play an interview with
[35:50.720 --> 35:54.000]  her later that she gave the CBC. It's just a few minute interview where she described.
[35:54.000 --> 35:57.640]  She says, they kept asking, what are your political views? Are you here to criticize
[35:57.640 --> 36:03.240]  the Olympics? Are you here to criticize our treatment of people during the Olympics?
[36:03.240 --> 36:11.640]  And she said, no, I'm here for an event. I'm going to give a speech. It's probably about
[36:11.640 --> 36:16.400]  the wars. And they said, well, we're not going to let you in if you're going to talk bad
[36:16.400 --> 36:23.400]  about the Olympics. And they then went into her computers, her notes. They went over everything
[36:23.400 --> 36:27.000]  with the fine tooth comb. She was held for hour after hour. And then she was finally
[36:27.000 --> 36:32.200]  released when I went into Canada, they pulled me off the airplane, took me and screamed
[36:32.200 --> 36:37.480]  at me, cost at me and said, we're going to send you to prison for lying to come into
[36:37.480 --> 36:42.640]  Canada. You're going to be in a Canadian jail for years and laughed in their black uniforms.
[36:42.640 --> 36:46.960]  They then got all three of our laptops and they said, if we find any porn, you're going
[36:46.960 --> 36:53.440]  to prison for transferring porn across state lines. And I said, porn, you mean illegal
[36:53.440 --> 36:59.960]  porn? They said all porn. They said, if you have a pinup of a topless Marilyn Monroe,
[36:59.960 --> 37:04.040]  the actual quote was, if you have a pinup girl with their top off, you're going to
[37:04.040 --> 37:11.560]  prison and by the grace of God, of all three of our computers, they searched for 15 hours.
[37:11.560 --> 37:20.120]  We were held. Nothing was found illegal, not a Betty page, not a Marilyn Monroe. And I
[37:20.120 --> 37:25.440]  don't know what computer, what office computer has it has something like that pop up on it
[37:25.440 --> 37:29.920]  because it was the transferring and over lines. Then they called me and they said, we know
[37:29.920 --> 37:36.440]  you're here for Bilderberg. That's why we stopped you. And you're being watched. And
[37:36.440 --> 37:41.640]  luckily the media was expecting to meet with us. So we were able to get a phone call out
[37:41.640 --> 37:45.080]  because they took our computers and cell phones, but Ryan Slickhuy's and had a tiny little
[37:45.080 --> 37:50.880]  cell phone while we were in the holding area. I took the phone made the call to Jim Tucker.
[37:50.880 --> 37:54.440]  He called the CBC that he was supposed to be meeting that morning along with myself.
[37:54.440 --> 37:59.160]  They showed up with cameras and at least the media still has the instinct to defend the
[37:59.160 --> 38:06.160]  press. And so when four or five major media outlets, it ended up being in scores of newspapers
[38:06.160 --> 38:14.320]  all over CBC, all over the other TV networks. What's the other one? CTV, Canadian TV, the
[38:14.320 --> 38:20.480]  private channel. Cause a lot of them are based right there in Ottawa, the capital of Canada.
[38:20.480 --> 38:27.040]  And they had to release us. And then they had these good looking female cops in a Mustang
[38:27.040 --> 38:32.960]  tailing us the whole time. They were very, very lovely. And we'd, they'd get behind
[38:32.960 --> 38:36.800]  us and I'd slow down. They go around us and they'd wave and smile. And then they kept,
[38:36.800 --> 38:45.000]  they followed us for the three days we were there. But they had some other cops following
[38:45.000 --> 38:50.800]  us, but I didn't tend to notice them as much as the two female police officers. But that's
[38:50.800 --> 38:57.520]  how I remember it so well. They were in plain clothes, but that's what Canada is. And Canadians
[38:57.520 --> 39:00.520]  should wake up and realize you're living in an amazing police day. I always get these
[39:00.520 --> 39:04.560]  calls and emails from Canadians, great people on average, very friendly, very intelligent.
[39:04.560 --> 39:08.560]  They say, do you think we'll get as bad as the US? What planet are you living on? You're
[39:08.560 --> 39:12.120]  as bad or worse. You're just like England. All right. I'm going to shut up now and go
[39:12.120 --> 39:18.840]  back to Brandon in Canada and break this down for people. The Canadian papers have had headlines
[39:18.840 --> 39:24.360]  like Marshall law to be in place in Canada for Olympics, Chinese style police state to
[39:24.360 --> 39:30.840]  be in place in Canada for Olympics. That's another headline, homeless to be detained
[39:30.840 --> 39:36.680]  during Olympics. They've announced all over the country. Oh, we're going to have army
[39:36.680 --> 39:42.640]  patrolling the streets now. So the same thing happening here is happening there in Pittsburgh.
[39:42.640 --> 39:46.200]  They announced for the three days of the G 20 as the global bankers came in to run things
[39:46.200 --> 39:51.080]  and ahead of Copenhagen happening in seven days. And they said no one allowed out on
[39:51.080 --> 39:55.200]  the streets and they would go out and find people barbecuing at parks and hit them with
[39:55.200 --> 39:59.200]  sound cannons. They would drive through neighborhoods and find kids playing football or baseball.
[39:59.200 --> 40:03.960]  We have video and photos of this and hit them with sound weapons. They would go to the university
[40:03.960 --> 40:09.160]  even after the event was closed for a day on Friday night and attack the college kids
[40:09.160 --> 40:12.920]  out at night and chase down young women beating them in the head with billy clubs. I mean,
[40:12.920 --> 40:17.520]  it's all on video and they would go into the dorms attacking people just wanting to attack
[40:17.520 --> 40:23.240]  the slaves wanting to show us that we're slaves. So they use these special events in China,
[40:23.240 --> 40:28.000]  in Italy, in England, in the United States, in Canada, in Australia. Australia is one
[40:28.000 --> 40:31.520]  of the first five, six years ago to announce martial law. You're not allowed to protest,
[40:31.520 --> 40:35.800]  you'll be arrested. And so they're just setting the precedent that we live like they do in
[40:35.800 --> 40:41.960]  China or worse. And so going back to Brandon, now make your point specifically about the
[40:41.960 --> 40:44.480]  homeless and what you're reading in the newspapers.
[40:44.480 --> 40:51.520]  Well, you know, Alex, it's when you can't protest corruption and the kind of corruption
[40:51.520 --> 40:58.160]  that's going on, there's complete tyranny obviously going on here. And, you know, just
[40:58.160 --> 41:02.880]  labeling people as terrorists. It's a form of brainwashing. It's like, you know, nobody
[41:02.880 --> 41:05.920]  else is going to want to protest it because then they automatically think they're going
[41:05.920 --> 41:06.920]  to be a terrorist.
[41:06.920 --> 41:07.920]  Exactly.
[41:07.920 --> 41:08.920]  It's a chilling effect.
[41:08.920 --> 41:16.000]  Yeah. So, you know, they even, and they bad, they, in a paper, they wrote about us that
[41:16.000 --> 41:21.000]  we were throwing, and this is ridiculous. They had little horses following us around
[41:21.000 --> 41:25.840]  on the protest. And they, they said in the papers, we were throwing marbles under their,
[41:25.840 --> 41:30.080]  under their feet. You know, just writing ridiculous things just to try to make it.
[41:30.080 --> 41:35.160]  You wanted to hurt the horse. And of course, the Royal Mount of Police were caught and
[41:35.160 --> 41:40.760]  it ended up being in national papers, were caught dressed up like anarchists, attacking
[41:40.760 --> 41:50.400]  their own officers in the, at the SPP meeting in Ottawa about a year and a half ago as a
[41:50.400 --> 41:55.480]  pretext to blame the peaceful protesters and attack them. Your police are on record lying
[41:55.480 --> 41:58.360]  and staging many false flag attacks.
[41:58.360 --> 42:06.360]  That's right, Alex. And, um, you know, about the whole police state, I was actually looking
[42:06.360 --> 42:12.360]  at an application. They want to hire, I think somewhere between five and 10,000, just normal
[42:12.360 --> 42:18.120]  civilian security guards for this. And then, yeah, I also read over 5,000, and this is
[42:18.120 --> 42:23.760]  just one, this is Vancouver. It's not a big, it's a 5 million person city max, I think.
[42:23.760 --> 42:31.800]  And you know, over 5,000 military personnel add to that all the, I bet you for sure, Victoria,
[42:31.800 --> 42:35.480]  Vancouver police are all going to be there. So literally there's going to be, I bet over
[42:35.480 --> 42:42.400]  20,000 police there. So yeah, talk about a police state. I mean, that's just crazy.
[42:42.400 --> 42:48.840]  Um, so, and it's interesting, another point you made, Alex, like Canadians really, I think
[42:48.840 --> 42:53.920]  do need to wake up because we all are just in this little fantasy mode thinking our country
[42:53.920 --> 42:58.560]  is just the safest place in the world. Um, I mean, most of the population, I've talked
[42:58.560 --> 43:02.480]  to some people about this, and they just, they just really don't think any corruption
[43:02.480 --> 43:06.200]  could ever happen here. They just think all the corruption's happening in America and
[43:06.200 --> 43:14.160]  Canada is just a safe haven. And so the winter Olympics are happening all over the country
[43:14.160 --> 43:21.800]  in every major city being walked down with the paramilitary forces. And I remember five,
[43:21.800 --> 43:27.500]  six years ago, Bush got criticized going to Middle Eastern countries and African countries
[43:27.500 --> 43:32.960]  and Asian countries, how the police would go in and detain all the homeless people and
[43:32.960 --> 43:38.240]  clear the streets for the emperor. And then now they do that in Canada and it's, oh, no
[43:38.240 --> 43:43.600]  big deal. We're just, uh, give people specifics of how they're taking them to this lockdown
[43:43.600 --> 43:45.600]  Alcatraz or Devils Island.
[43:45.600 --> 43:51.560]  Well, that's right, Alex. And, you know, most of these people have dogs and I, I work,
[43:51.560 --> 43:55.640]  I do ministry with a lot of homeless people and, you know, their dogs are the best friends.
[43:55.640 --> 44:00.520]  But basically they're bringing them all to these little probably dirty cells saying,
[44:00.520 --> 44:05.600]  oh, you know, you have to stay here. Um, you know, there's thousands of homeless people
[44:05.600 --> 44:11.440]  in Vancouver and just bringing them forcibly on boats, you know, because you need a boat
[44:11.440 --> 44:16.480]  to get to this island, which is Victoria, right next to Vancouver. And they're going
[44:16.480 --> 44:21.200]  to be putting them in cells for the time being. You can't have your dog in there either. So
[44:21.200 --> 44:25.880]  no one knows what's going to happen to their dogs and notice how they spin it. Notice
[44:25.880 --> 44:31.400]  how they spin it. Oh, they get to stay in the cells. They get to go to the center just
[44:31.400 --> 44:37.120]  like Seattle in 99 when the Delta force Seattle post intelligence or Seattle times in my
[44:37.120 --> 44:41.280]  film police state to the takeover.
[44:41.280 --> 44:47.360]  So there's your documentation took people to the Sandpoint Naval Brig now run by FEMA.
[44:47.360 --> 44:51.800]  And again, this is how it worked in Germany in the mid 1930s. They first started rounding
[44:51.800 --> 44:58.520]  up the retarded rounding up the homeless, taking people's disabled children, the same
[44:58.520 --> 45:04.920]  things rationing healthcare to the old. It's the same eugenics scientific dictatorship
[45:04.920 --> 45:08.840]  we've seen over and over again.
[45:08.840 --> 45:16.280]  And they're using any big event as a pretext to fully take over society. This is how freedom
[45:16.280 --> 45:20.040]  dies. I appreciate your call, Brandon.
[45:20.040 --> 45:25.360]  The good news is folks are shooting video of this. They're posting it to YouTube and
[45:25.360 --> 45:31.960]  the alternative media is exposing what's happening all over the planet. The good news is these
[45:31.960 --> 45:40.240]  these tyrants who put the iron fist of authoritarian oppression in a velvet glove are being exposed
[45:40.240 --> 45:41.960]  for who they are.
[45:41.960 --> 45:48.480]  By the way, we are changing other groups in Florida in Colorado in Illinois, all over
[45:48.480 --> 45:54.240]  the country in Tennessee are going in and confronting Al Gore. It's mainly our listeners.
[45:54.240 --> 45:58.120]  I want to salute you and praise you. We've been posting these videos every other day
[45:58.120 --> 46:05.960]  on info wars.com and prison planet.com of our wonderful activist listeners going into
[46:05.960 --> 46:09.800]  book signing saying Al Gore, what do you think of climate gate? Al Gore, what do you think
[46:09.800 --> 46:12.880]  of lying and saying polar bears can't swim? Al Gore, what do you think of the fact that
[46:12.880 --> 46:18.160]  the earth is actually cooling according to the real climate record and Al Gore is flipping
[46:18.160 --> 46:24.320]  out having security grab them and drag them out even when they're polite. That's making
[46:24.320 --> 46:30.600]  a scene and then all the TV, all the newspapers are then going outside the book stores and
[46:30.600 --> 46:35.880]  other places where Gore is going and interviewing them. And so now they're taking over all the
[46:35.880 --> 46:43.240]  newspaper and TV reports and the fact of climate gate and his fraud is being forced. I literally
[46:43.240 --> 46:47.600]  want to salute and thank all of you every single person, every single group that shot
[46:47.600 --> 46:55.600]  video. Please contact show tips and info wars.com. We're going to go through there every day.
[46:55.600 --> 47:00.680]  So we can schedule a show this week or next week where I have five, 10, 15 different groups
[47:00.680 --> 47:06.560]  on to talk about what they've done to Gore, exposing this criminal. This is how we take
[47:06.560 --> 47:10.720]  the country back. They can lock down whole cities for the Olympics or for the G 20. They
[47:10.720 --> 47:16.120]  can't go lock down every city for Al Gore. And even if they try, it exposes them as the
[47:16.120 --> 47:23.840]  petty tyrants they are. And I want to beg the we are change folks, send me your video
[47:23.840 --> 47:29.240]  if you want it to be and follow the Republic to because we have the great we are change
[47:29.240 --> 47:34.280]  footage of J Rockefeller being exposed. This film is going to be about eugenics and we're
[47:34.280 --> 47:39.120]  feverishly working on it and it will be seen millions of times. My films get seen millions
[47:39.120 --> 47:42.760]  of times. All your great YouTube get seen tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands,
[47:42.760 --> 47:46.480]  especially when we link to them. We try to promote what you're doing. So others see it
[47:46.480 --> 47:51.080]  and go out and take action. But by putting it in the film, we will show the big picture
[47:51.080 --> 47:57.360]  and this will spur even more people to this type of a very effective, efficient activism
[47:57.360 --> 48:03.120]  where you take over the TV reports, you take over the newspaper reports. This is growing.
[48:03.120 --> 48:07.800]  This is how we're going to bring these tyrants to their knees and expose their fraud. So
[48:07.800 --> 48:13.400]  we are change Ohio. We are change Illinois. We are change Florida. We are change Colorado.
[48:13.400 --> 48:17.200]  All these groups are in other groups going out confronting Gore. If you want your footage
[48:17.200 --> 48:24.400]  in the film, dump it on DVD or on DV cam, mail it to P O box one nine five four nine
[48:24.400 --> 48:31.600]  Austin, Texas seven eight seven six zero because we want to put you in for the Republic to
[48:31.600 --> 48:38.360]  we want what you've done to be seen by millions. And we've done everything we can from day
[48:38.360 --> 48:42.240]  one to support. We are change. We salute. We are change and all these other wonderful
[48:42.240 --> 48:46.680]  activist groups and this film is just going to be dynamite, especially with the Al Gore
[48:46.680 --> 48:50.360]  footage we're getting in the mail. But I want a lot of it because some of it shot on a little
[48:50.360 --> 48:55.560]  bit of cameras or it's really sure jerky or shaky. It doesn't matter. Trying is what
[48:55.560 --> 48:59.240]  it's all about. And you take over the local media. That's what's more important. The point
[48:59.240 --> 49:05.440]  is some of it's really clear. We're now seeing online. We need that video. Please take action
[49:05.440 --> 49:09.280]  today, ladies and gentlemen, and send us a letter with who gets credit and with our
[49:09.280 --> 49:15.640]  authorization to use it P O box one nine five four nine Austin, Texas seven eight seven

[49:21.600 --> 49:27.960]  as new developments happen to make this about activism and solutions and taking our system
[49:27.960 --> 49:32.600]  back and we need other young heroes, heroes in the making to see what the great men and
[49:32.600 --> 49:38.360]  women are doing out there confronting Al Gore, confronting the CFR people, confronting

[52:04.320 --> 52:09.960]  in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing
[52:09.960 --> 52:15.520]  off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home. We have tremendous
[52:15.520 --> 52:20.960]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think
[52:20.960 --> 52:26.800]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the republic
[52:26.800 --> 52:32.520]  identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[52:32.520 --> 52:37.520]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're
[52:37.520 --> 52:41.400]  personists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make
[52:41.400 --> 52:46.760]  the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington D.C.,
[52:46.760 --> 52:54.600]  we have seen a fall of the republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.

[53:15.560 --> 53:22.600]  expert, urging you to avoid risky vaccinations this flu season. Rely instead on oxysilver.

[54:03.640 --> 54:07.240]  Just in case somebody didn't tap you on the shoulder and tell you we're in the middle
[54:07.240 --> 54:14.640]  of a revolution against tyranny right now. The revolution is on. It is peaceful, but
[54:14.640 --> 54:20.880]  the establishment is trying to jack boot, intimidate the people. I want to tell the
[54:20.880 --> 54:23.880]  police and military something. I know a lot of you are good men and women and know what's
[54:23.880 --> 54:30.040]  going on. You're being set up to be chewed up by the American people. We don't want this
[54:30.040 --> 54:43.840]  to get violent. We are doing everything we can. Crank up Johnny Cash.
[54:43.840 --> 54:51.120]  Make the choice. Decide who you serve. The truth or the lie? What does your gut tell
[54:51.120 --> 54:57.400]  you if you work for the system? Do you like working for a bunch of kin laid, made off
[54:57.400 --> 55:06.360]  types? Do you like working for people openly setting up tyrannical world government? You
[55:06.360 --> 55:12.600]  know you want to join us. You know in your gut you want to come in for the big win against
[55:12.600 --> 55:20.880]  tyranny. You know you want to join us. It's an open hand and not a clenched fist that's
[55:20.880 --> 55:49.040]  offered. It's proffered. We're here. Look what happened to Hitler. Look what happened
[55:49.040 --> 56:05.080]  to Sudan. Look what happened to Pol Pot. Look what happened to all these people. The people,
[56:05.080 --> 56:14.320]  the truth is rising. Eddie in Virginia. You're on the air Eddie.
[56:14.320 --> 56:22.720]  I want to know how much of our president Afghanistan is tied to that unicall pipeline.
[56:22.720 --> 56:28.560]  A large portion of it is trillions what was estimated seven years ago at $8 trillion in
[56:28.560 --> 56:35.680]  discovered removable reserves. And of course you look at five trillion leverage to the
[56:35.680 --> 56:40.800]  $500 billion in opium a year and that answers all your questions why we're there.
[56:40.800 --> 56:48.080]  Now as far as the proxy armies that are being used by the United States to war against our
[56:48.080 --> 56:52.880]  own military. They are being financed via the opium.
[56:52.880 --> 56:57.720]  Yes it's on record. Our own special forces colonels have gone public. Literally hundreds
[56:57.720 --> 57:03.440]  of mainstream articles MSNBC you name it. Airlift of Evil. That's just Google MSNBC
[57:03.440 --> 57:09.040]  Airlift of Evil. Times of London. Flying Taliban L cut out the safety financing them
[57:09.040 --> 57:14.320]  to attack our own troops. Literally if you've got a war making trillions of dollars in weapons
[57:14.320 --> 57:20.740]  sales and no bid contracts and opium and oil a year in Central Asia and the Middle East
[57:20.740 --> 57:27.560]  you will finance stage terror attacks. And that's what's happening and the public just
[57:27.560 --> 57:32.800]  cannot believe the magnitude of this. What percentage of that money is laundered through
[57:32.800 --> 57:37.800]  the US banks? A large portion now it looks like the Russians
[57:37.800 --> 57:41.240]  are being cut in. They're backing off and lending their support with airfields and
[57:41.240 --> 57:49.120]  advisers. But the vast majority goes through Anglo American, US, British, European banks.
[57:49.120 --> 57:57.320]  They can use to do the fraction reserve banking you know multiply how you know 100 fold, 10,000
[57:57.320 --> 58:01.760]  fold. Well yeah I mean in the past they only leveraged 10 to 1 so $500 billion would be
[58:01.760 --> 58:07.520]  $5 trillion. But with the end of the Glass-Steagall Act they went to unlimited fractional and so
[58:07.520 --> 58:14.960]  potentially it's unlimited. Thank you sir. Thank you so much for the call. Good points.
[58:14.960 --> 58:24.200]  Eddie in Virginia. Okay Greg, Ray, Bad Baby and others. My 20 month old was throwing food
[58:24.200 --> 58:34.480]  this morning. I said Bad Baby. We have another Bad Baby on the line. 1-800-259-9231. I didn't
[58:34.480 --> 58:42.480]  say Bad Baby but I thought Bad Baby. Alright we'll be right back.

[1:00:13.160 --> 1:00:20.160]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:29.520 --> 1:00:36.520]  We're now into hour number two. We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv, simulcasting
[1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:42.600]  the radio show and living television color at PrisonPlanet.tv and T-minus 30 minutes.
[1:00:42.600 --> 1:00:47.960]  I'm going to play the incredible job that We Are Changed Chicago did confronting Al Gore
[1:00:47.960 --> 1:00:54.360]  and making news headlines. We salute We Are Changed Chicago and all the other great activists
[1:00:54.360 --> 1:00:59.640]  out there that are just doing an amazing job. It's so wonderful to see this happening.
[1:00:59.640 --> 1:01:03.720]  This is really catching fire now in the minds of men and women everywhere and spreading
[1:01:03.720 --> 1:01:10.080]  and everywhere that slime ball that demonic Nellie goes. He's being confronted with the
[1:01:10.080 --> 1:01:14.800]  truth. This is just beautiful. That is coming up. We're going to break down Climate Gate.
[1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:20.520]  We're going to break down the sad, tragic shooting and murder of these four police officers.
[1:01:20.520 --> 1:01:25.400]  We're getting ready for work at a coffee shop and a trend I've noticed there that I've seen
[1:01:25.400 --> 1:01:31.360]  no one else point out. So we'll be going over that as well today. But right now let's go
[1:01:31.360 --> 1:01:35.200]  back to your phone calls. Greg in Tennessee. Greg, you're on the air.
[1:01:35.200 --> 1:01:41.800]  Hi, Alex. I'm Greg from the great state of Tennessee, the volunteer state. I'm a businessman
[1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:47.120]  and one of the things I try to measure is my business on as a result. I've been following
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:52.040]  you for a while now. I guess my question to you is, do you feel like we're making progress
[1:01:52.040 --> 1:01:57.600]  here or are we just going to the bathroom in the wind, so to speak, because the powers
[1:01:57.600 --> 1:02:06.000]  that be, okay, that's double edged. In fact, it's triple edged. We are having incredible
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:15.060]  shocking, devastating, savage, unopposed victory when we decide to stand up. Every time we
[1:02:15.060 --> 1:02:22.360]  take action, we're having incredible victory, but more people are cynical and one instant
[1:02:22.360 --> 1:02:28.500]  success. They want to go out and protest Al Gore one time and see everything collapse.
[1:02:28.500 --> 1:02:31.680]  That's not going to happen. We're not going to defeat their criminal system and bring
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:38.360]  down their tower of Babel without incremental long view of history. The globalists understand
[1:02:38.360 --> 1:02:45.360]  never giving up, always taking action with their evil greed and, and, and piratical desire.
[1:02:45.360 --> 1:02:50.600]  We need to understand that it's a long incremental fight with truth and liberty. And so, yes,
[1:02:50.600 --> 1:02:54.040]  I mean, we're having so many, I mean, I'm not trying to toot my horn, but sir, can
[1:02:54.040 --> 1:02:59.240]  you, I can't even express to you the level of success I've had. I'm only one attack
[1:02:59.240 --> 1:03:04.320]  frigate on the seas fighting the globalist here. Okay. And, and I mean, every, every
[1:03:04.320 --> 1:03:09.520]  ship we engage to use that analogy, we're blowing it to smithereens. I mean, I'm just
[1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:14.960]  out here smashing enemy forces left and right with my wonderful audience that's taking action.
[1:03:14.960 --> 1:03:19.040]  But we need to launch more patrol boats, more missile cruisers, more attack ships, more
[1:03:19.040 --> 1:03:25.240]  torpedo planes. And every one of you that take action and gets involved and just volunteers,
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:29.080]  like you said from the volunteer state. I mean, look at the Tennessee groups. I think
[1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:32.440]  I believe it was we are changed. I saw in the paper, they went confronted Al Gore and
[1:03:32.440 --> 1:03:36.280]  took over all the newspaper coverage. Look at Florida. Look everywhere else. He everywhere
[1:03:36.280 --> 1:03:41.040]  he goes, everywhere he goes. He's being shooken up. He's stuttering. He's red faced. He's
[1:03:41.040 --> 1:03:47.120]  bumbling. He makes the wrong choice, has his goons, grab people, which is a crime. They
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:50.800]  don't even resist and private goons, grab people. That blows up in their face. Goes
[1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:55.800]  all over TV and radio and print. I mean, just everywhere we stand up, we, we kick their
[1:03:55.800 --> 1:04:02.680]  butt. So yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yes. Do we have a fighting chance? If we fight, there's
[1:04:02.680 --> 1:04:07.600]  no way we can lose exactly. And that's what I'm trying to get out to. I talked to a friend
[1:04:07.600 --> 1:04:14.520]  of mine, actually an email this morning and he's in Texas and he knows what's going on.
[1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:19.360]  And his, his thing was, well, I'm just one guy with a, with a few guns and that's kind
[1:04:19.360 --> 1:04:23.920]  of a defeatist attitude. Exactly. Guns are a key insurance policy against
[1:04:23.920 --> 1:04:28.280]  tyranny, but they're the most disgusting cop out. People just sitting on a horde of weapons
[1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:33.080]  and food, never doing anything, waiting to be dug out of their holes. You need the backup
[1:04:33.080 --> 1:04:38.040]  and the boogie out plan, the bug out plan, but at the same time you need to be out there
[1:04:38.040 --> 1:04:53.680]  engaged at city council in a suit. Yes, organize and then engage. A lot of people over organize
[1:04:53.680 --> 1:04:57.880]  and want to get it just perfect. Look, just get up on your hind legs, put your fist in
[1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:03.400]  balls and start swinging. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important
[1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:08.200]  questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much
[1:05:08.200 --> 1:05:13.240]  ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and
[1:05:13.240 --> 1:05:18.040]  the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When
[1:05:18.040 --> 1:05:22.960]  do you want it now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without
[1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:27.320]  proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's
[1:05:27.320 --> 1:05:31.640]  a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be
[1:05:31.640 --> 1:05:36.480]  immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[1:05:36.480 --> 1:05:41.920]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:46.400]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to

[1:08:05.960 --> 1:08:12.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:24.320]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:24.320 --> 1:08:31.360]  Eight minutes into hour number two. I just had a caller, Reagan, Tennessee, saying, are
[1:08:31.360 --> 1:08:41.720]  we making headway or are we just whistling in the wind? Resistance is victory. Having
[1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:46.480]  a fighting spirit, knowing you're on the right side of history, taking action. We're not
[1:08:46.480 --> 1:08:52.560]  going to defeat the New World Order overnight. None of us are going to have instant success,
[1:08:52.560 --> 1:08:58.560]  but it's almost like a certain harmonic frequency can shatter crystal. And if you ever stood
[1:08:58.560 --> 1:09:04.680]  up against a big metal pylon in a warehouse and just slowly started in rhythm, hitting
[1:09:04.680 --> 1:09:10.680]  on it over and over again and catching that right harmonic frequency and soon the whole
[1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:16.560]  roof is shaking, you ever seen how when you turn on the water faucet on low and it happens
[1:09:16.560 --> 1:09:20.440]  to send a harmonic frequency through the pipes and they start groaning and shaking and it
[1:09:20.440 --> 1:09:25.880]  sounds like a train wreck is happening? It's the same thing. It's that woodpecker effect
[1:09:25.880 --> 1:09:32.360]  of pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding and pounding
[1:09:32.360 --> 1:09:35.920]  and they'll tell you, oh, you're losing. There's no way to fight us. Oh, there's no New World
[1:09:35.920 --> 1:09:41.000]  Order, but we want global government. Oh, just on and on and on. Oh, you're going to lose
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:45.280]  GI. Oh, there's no victory. There's no way you can win. Oh, the New World Order is a
[1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:49.000]  foregone conclusion. Look, we've paid off all your preachers to tell you that to lay
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.600]  down that it's the rapture. Drilling that in your brain, drilling it over and over, you're
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:57.480]  going to lose. You're going to lose. There's no New World Order, but we want you to have
[1:09:57.480 --> 1:10:03.440]  a New World Order. Al Gore laughs and smiles and gets arrogant the first four or five times
[1:10:03.440 --> 1:10:08.080]  he's been confronted in the last month and a half by different activist groups about
[1:10:08.080 --> 1:10:13.480]  global warming, being man made, being a fraud. And now he gets angry, red face. Now he stutters.
[1:10:13.480 --> 1:10:17.520]  Now he gets angry. Now he's beginning to freak out and more people are coming and more and
[1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:24.400]  more and now everywhere he ever goes for the rest of his life because this form of activism
[1:10:24.400 --> 1:10:29.300]  that I unknowingly pioneered. I mean, people for thousands of years have gone to public
[1:10:29.300 --> 1:10:33.680]  events and shouted down the tyrant. There were famous cases in history where corrupt
[1:10:33.680 --> 1:10:40.440]  kings and nobles and lords would be shouted down by an old woman. A lot of times the lords
[1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:45.120]  would say, seize her and drag her away. People say, look, they're arresting people that only
[1:10:45.120 --> 1:10:50.840]  blows up in their face bigger. That's your sacrifice, but no one's getting arrested here.
[1:10:50.840 --> 1:10:53.760]  They're just being drug out in the media is like, well, why'd you drag him out? Let's
[1:10:53.760 --> 1:11:00.760]  go talk to these people. And that's just one example is Al Gore bursting into flames, burning
[1:11:00.760 --> 1:11:06.480]  down in front of us. I mean, this guy's a 10 alarm fire. If he was a five story building,
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:15.080]  he's collapsing right now. And I would go confront Janet Reno or I would go confront
[1:11:15.080 --> 1:11:20.560]  George W. Bush. I would go confront General McCaffrey and hold up a Reuters article about
[1:11:20.560 --> 1:11:27.960]  how his designate the head of all army operations over narcotics in Latin America was caught
[1:11:27.960 --> 1:11:33.560]  shipping and harrow masses of heroin and cocaine. And he literally turned red faced, paused
[1:11:33.560 --> 1:11:42.640]  began stuttering and everyone booed him and began clapping me. All you got to do is stand
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:49.280]  up to him. What did the founder of the Texas Rangers say? I forget the exact quote. A man
[1:11:49.280 --> 1:11:55.600]  in the wrong can't stand up against a man in the right who keeps on a common. It's that
[1:11:55.600 --> 1:12:01.540]  last part keeps on a common. You may demonize me in the national media. You may beat me
[1:12:01.540 --> 1:12:06.000]  up in a parking lot. You may physically attack me. You may audit me. You may do whatever
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:15.580]  you want. I will never stop. I am setting my will against you fully and you can't consciously
[1:12:15.580 --> 1:12:21.440]  set your will. You have to just totally turn yourself mentally over to something and it's
[1:12:21.440 --> 1:12:28.240]  a change of heart. It's a decision. You have to say I am committed. I am not going to stop.
[1:12:28.240 --> 1:12:37.360]  And ladies and gentlemen, that is invincible. That is unstoppable in the numbers we have.
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:41.400]  I mean, if the globalist outnumbered is 10,000 to one, they would just exterminate us, but
[1:12:41.400 --> 1:12:48.320]  we outnumber them 10,000 to one. We outnumber them 1,000 to one in every town and city.
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:54.440]  Top globalist, we outnumber them a million to one. I mean, 7 billion people. What is
[1:12:54.440 --> 1:13:02.480]  there? 6 billion, 800 million plus now in the world to the last subsensus last year?
[1:13:02.480 --> 1:13:05.880]  Rothkopf, the head of the Kissinger Group, last year wrote a book called Super Class
[1:13:05.880 --> 1:13:11.360]  where he said there's 6,000 super gophers to less than 20 families that rule the planet.
[1:13:11.360 --> 1:13:16.680]  He's quite proud of himself. I had him on the radio show.
[1:13:16.680 --> 1:13:20.120]  And I said to him during breaks, John Harmon heard all this. I said, why are you coming
[1:13:20.120 --> 1:13:24.640]  on here? I mean, you know who I am. You know I'm against you. He said, well, we just want
[1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:28.960]  to try to convince you that we're just normal people and that our plan for globalization
[1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:35.440]  is what's needed. And we're interested in understanding you, Mr. Jones. And I now have
[1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:39.520]  top globalist and I am a reporter. That's one of the hats I wear. So when a globalist
[1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:43.840]  calls me up and says, I want to talk to you off record, they only call me because it's
[1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:49.840]  off record. Some people go, well, you need to say who they are. Yeah, and then lose
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:53.880]  the fact that, oh yeah, people are like, we don't believe you just released the Homeland
[1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:57.920]  Security Secret report saying veterans, gun owners, conservatives and libertarians are
[1:13:57.920 --> 1:14:03.080]  terrorist and that Homeland Security is really set up for them. People tried to bait me the
[1:14:03.080 --> 1:14:08.760]  first few days and we released that this year. Back in, what was it, back in January? Saying
[1:14:08.760 --> 1:14:13.760]  it's not real. Tell us the police officers. Tell us the federal marshals that gave you
[1:14:13.760 --> 1:14:22.240]  this. But then days later, it came out. It was all real and that we broke it. And see,
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:26.480]  those are little tricks they use. Oh, tell us who your sources are. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
[1:14:26.480 --> 1:14:30.960]  I'm going to tell you who my sources are. They'd have to put me on the rack. They'd
[1:14:30.960 --> 1:14:34.840]  have to torture me to find out who my sources are. I'll never give up my sources because
[1:14:34.840 --> 1:14:49.080]  I'm an honorable person A and B, I would lose my sources. But now I've got high level globalists
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:56.400]  calling me up. I can't believe Thursday a high level globalist wants to come here and
[1:14:56.400 --> 1:15:04.560]  meet with me. Folks, if you only knew how real this is, if you only knew that they are afraid
[1:15:04.560 --> 1:15:09.320]  of me because I have the spirit of victory, something all of you have as well, if you
[1:15:09.320 --> 1:15:14.840]  just recognize it and let it grow in you. It's not just confidence. It's the confidence
[1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:19.000]  of knowing your right, knowing you're on the right side of history and taking action and
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:23.960]  saying, look, even if I don't have a snowball's chance in Hades and winning this thing, which
[1:15:23.960 --> 1:15:29.360]  we have a lot better chance than that, I'm going to do the right thing. All right, I
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:34.160]  said I'm going to your calls. Let's let's just go to him right now. Ray in California.
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:39.600]  Ray, you're on the air. Alex, I want to know if you have investigated
[1:15:39.600 --> 1:15:46.280]  or you have any information behind the Republican National Commission to invert their stars
[1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:54.960]  on the national logo. You know, they changed that in 2003 ahead of the 2004 election in
[1:15:54.960 --> 1:15:59.880]  all of their symbols, but namely the elephant with the top half being blue, the bottom half
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:09.820]  being red. And the stars had been tips pointed up. They inverted them. And then the election
[1:16:09.820 --> 1:16:19.240]  before that Al Gore in his famous debates, the Democrat debates, they projected upside
[1:16:19.240 --> 1:16:25.040]  down stars and a devil on the wall as clear as, as clear as day. And yes, these are a
[1:16:25.040 --> 1:16:29.160]  group of lunatic Satanist. And it's just a fact. I've been to one of their rituals.
[1:16:29.160 --> 1:16:35.560]  I infiltrated it. And back in 2000, Bohemian Grove, and I'm telling you, truth is a thousand
[1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:40.160]  times stranger than fiction. But did the Republican Party give an explanation?
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:49.600]  No, no, and they've been asked why. Strange. Okay, I mean, I mean, I mean, it's simple.
[1:16:49.600 --> 1:16:55.360]  They believe they get more power. They're Luciferians, and they believe the destructive
[1:16:55.360 --> 1:17:04.680]  force of the horned God slash goddess is more powerful, generally associated with the
[1:17:04.680 --> 1:17:09.720]  male force. And so they're letting you know, even in their paradigm that, hey, we're black
[1:17:09.720 --> 1:17:16.720]  magic, we're, we're into devil tree. And Chris Matthews, when he uses the GOP graphic,
[1:17:16.720 --> 1:17:21.640]  he uses the old one with the stars right side up. Not all that that just may be because
[1:17:21.640 --> 1:17:28.400]  that's what their graphic is in their computer. Okay, I mean, I don't know. You can read
[1:17:28.400 --> 1:17:34.200]  too much into it, but I figure they would get it right being mainstream media network
[1:17:34.200 --> 1:17:38.120]  that they would at least get the correct logo. Yeah, I haven't checked it in a few months,
[1:17:38.120 --> 1:17:43.880]  but last time I was on the fact guys, we pull up RNC.org Republican National Committee.
[1:17:43.880 --> 1:17:49.160]  Let's see if they still got the Baphomet going there flashing their gang sign. Thank you
[1:17:49.160 --> 1:17:54.160]  so much for the call. All right. Bad baby in Michigan. You're on the air.
[1:17:54.160 --> 1:18:03.720]  Hello, Alex. Hi. I am a fellow radio host, too. I just got done interviewing Dr. Betty
[1:18:03.720 --> 1:18:09.480]  Martini. I've also interviewed Dr. Lynn Horowitz. Good. What's on your mind, ma'am? Well, let
[1:18:09.480 --> 1:18:15.960]  me tell you, I want to tell you that I'm a targeted individual from our government for
[1:18:15.960 --> 1:18:21.800]  standing up against these criminals and this man that just called and said the man that
[1:18:21.800 --> 1:18:26.560]  said, I'm just one person. Well, I'm just one person, too, honey. And my life has been
[1:18:26.560 --> 1:18:32.520]  threatened and I've been had many attempts on my life. Really? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. I've
[1:18:32.520 --> 1:18:37.960]  had gas turned on in my building and almost blew up. I've had my shotgun jammed. I've
[1:18:37.960 --> 1:18:44.320]  been poisoned. And it's because I do what you do, Alex. I stand up and say, no, I am
[1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:48.240]  going to fight these people. Well, most people, I know that fight the New World Order because
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:54.440]  there's so many of us now don't have any bad repercussions. But sometimes, especially with
[1:18:54.440 --> 1:18:58.280]  locals, though, that might have, you know, your shotgun jamming. I don't know how they
[1:18:58.280 --> 1:19:02.920]  would do that. Or I know gas. The other day, I actually left the gas on for about two minutes
[1:19:02.920 --> 1:19:07.120]  and noticed it and turned it off. But I'm not saying you're not being harassed, but
[1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:14.280]  I do think in all this crazy stuff in the media, certainly, you know, when they're openly
[1:19:14.280 --> 1:19:18.840]  announcing, they want to microchip the population. They're openly announcing mind control and
[1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:24.600]  the CIA declassifies their mind control manual. That just came out a few days ago than a lot
[1:19:24.600 --> 1:19:28.360]  of people that are suggestible and already a little paranoid. I'm not saying that's you
[1:19:28.360 --> 1:19:33.160]  really get set off by it. I mean, I've seen all these videos online where schizophrenics
[1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:38.840]  are shooting video out of their window as some repair guy works on the works on the telephone
[1:19:38.840 --> 1:19:42.520]  lines and they're going, look at him. He's a fed and the guys out there eating a sandwich
[1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:46.840]  are picking their nose and I can tell you right there, they're not a fed. So look out
[1:19:46.840 --> 1:19:52.160]  there getting paranoid. But hey, in this day and age, you can't blame me. Maybe they are
[1:19:52.160 --> 1:19:57.480]  after you. But if these folks go after you, they tend to get you and turn your gas on.
[1:19:57.480 --> 1:20:00.640]  It doesn't usually how they do it. We'll be right back.
[1:20:00.640 --> 1:20:07.120]  Hello, at ofthefield.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness. We get lots

[1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:27.600]  weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from
[1:22:27.600 --> 1:22:31.480]  counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back
[1:22:31.480 --> 1:22:36.000]  to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt? Is this capitalism or
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:40.400]  was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater
[1:22:40.400 --> 1:22:45.120]  menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army? Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing

[1:24:15.280 --> 1:24:19.000]  going to simulcast at prisonplanet.tv in the last two and a half hours of the show today
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:27.680]  starting in the next segment. So prisonplanet.tv members and viewers start your engines. Let's
[1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:35.640]  go ahead and go to Pamela in Ohio. Pamela you're on the air. Hello. Hi. Hi. First of
[1:24:35.640 --> 1:24:41.320]  all I want to say thank you for being a watchman on the wall. You're sounding the alarm. You're
[1:24:41.320 --> 1:24:46.600]  blowing the trumpet and I know that God is very very pleased about that because he always
[1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:55.040]  says in his word what's hidden darkness shall be exposed in the light. And about if they
[1:24:55.040 --> 1:25:00.640]  ever come like you said if you'll keep going no matter what just always remember about
[1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:08.320]  Paul and Silas being in prison and the Lord gave an earthquake and they were freed. So
[1:25:08.320 --> 1:25:13.760]  you have all of God's protection on you and around you. You're exposing the truth and
[1:25:13.760 --> 1:25:18.960]  I thank you for that. The second thing is I'm calling I'm asking about you know that
[1:25:18.960 --> 1:25:28.000]  very chip that I think it's called RDFD or whatever it is that is that considered. Do
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:34.080]  you think that is considered like the mark of the beast. I think it's more than that.
[1:25:34.080 --> 1:25:39.200]  I think it's a system because they don't even need a microchip. They have your body resonance
[1:25:39.200 --> 1:25:47.000]  heat scan your individual body type when you walk up to an airport scanner or the government
[1:25:47.000 --> 1:25:53.040]  scanning systems they're putting in and your body is scanned they then attach your unique
[1:25:53.040 --> 1:25:59.960]  heat resonance fingerprint or digital matrix to that number and they can look right through
[1:25:59.960 --> 1:26:03.800]  your clothes and tell who you are even if you're in a disguise. They have biometrics
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:12.960]  for your walk biometric scanners for license plates. This is really the total control system
[1:26:12.960 --> 1:26:16.600]  whether you're a Christian or not. This is the system that's going to be used to control
[1:26:16.600 --> 1:26:20.320]  and track and trace and you know I talk about this 14 years ago and get laughed at when
[1:26:20.320 --> 1:26:25.200]  I government documents. Now I watched Quantum of Silence the new James Bond movie and the
[1:26:25.200 --> 1:26:31.080]  whole things about face scanning. Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is all about face scanning
[1:26:31.080 --> 1:26:34.760]  you know where they just throw it in your face now that the good guys are scanning your
[1:26:34.760 --> 1:26:39.920]  faces but in truth the people running the system are the bad guys and so they're putting
[1:26:39.920 --> 1:26:45.200]  this all in place so they can oppress people and so no one really has a way to defend themselves
[1:26:45.200 --> 1:26:50.840]  unless they just run suicide missions but even those will just be against the local
[1:26:50.840 --> 1:26:54.760]  police who the globalists want to chew up so they can militarize them more against the
[1:26:54.760 --> 1:27:01.760]  people and us against them situation. So we're in a lot of trouble and you know the elites
[1:27:01.760 --> 1:27:08.600]  are going to live out their lives in offshore reservations controlled safe zones inside
[1:27:08.600 --> 1:27:13.960]  the US inside high technology reservations inside the major cities and all of us are
[1:27:13.960 --> 1:27:18.280]  going to be walled off outside of that it's already like that to a great extent but this
[1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:22.760]  is their this is their control grid where government facilities and corporate facilities
[1:27:22.760 --> 1:27:28.080]  are green zones where they're safe from us and then they can dispatch their paramilitary
[1:27:28.080 --> 1:27:34.560]  forces to snatch our children to forcibly inoculate us to arrest us you won't be able to buy or
[1:27:34.560 --> 1:27:38.520]  sell this is the Homeland Security saying this if you're not in favor with them you
[1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:43.120]  won't be able to buy firearms the no fly list are going to be expanded to most of the population
[1:27:43.120 --> 1:27:47.760]  it'll then be a no work no buy list if you're homeless you're going to be arrested and taken
[1:27:47.760 --> 1:27:55.280]  to a work camp that's now being announced worldwide I mean this is hell and I'm wondering since
[1:27:55.280 --> 1:28:03.160]  God has not appointed us to rest and and do you think that that that will be taken you
[1:28:03.160 --> 1:28:09.080]  know before that the Christians will be taken before this and in other words no this will
[1:28:09.080 --> 1:28:14.640]  happen before the tribulation or after the tribulation ma'am that's why my radio show
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:20.800]  is is it's not secular which means without God but it's not a religious show I'm a Christian
[1:28:20.800 --> 1:28:26.520]  I don't hide that but at the same time I know that the globalist 100 plus years ago with
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:32.280]  Scofield and others took over the teaching in the Bibles and it's just all a complete
[1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:38.800]  fantasy the whole revelation and Daniel and Ezekiel and all of those prophecies are about
[1:28:38.800 --> 1:28:44.240]  waging war against the saints going after the people taking their children poisoning
[1:28:44.240 --> 1:28:50.760]  them and and and so you know there is stuff in revelations about the dead in Christ you
[1:28:50.760 --> 1:28:55.960]  know but being risen and but but the whole thing is about God's people going through
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:29:02.000]  this and and bearing testament to the truth during the bad times and the greatest awakening
[1:29:02.000 --> 1:29:06.640]  and revival to the fact that there is good and evil happening during this I mean look
[1:29:06.640 --> 1:29:13.040]  at all the prophets look at Christ they all had to go through the evil you know a lot
[1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:18.520]  of German Christians were told to stand down and that Hitler was the antichrist and they
[1:29:18.520 --> 1:29:24.200]  got killed the founders were told Romans 13 stand down to King George III Christians
[1:29:24.200 --> 1:29:30.040]  in Cambodia were murdered in mass by a pole pot thinking they were about to be raptured
[1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:33.600]  Christians in Cuba thought they were going to be raptured Christians in China thought
[1:29:33.600 --> 1:29:39.120]  they were going to be raptured and no ma'am you know regardless of what's going to happen
[1:29:39.120 --> 1:29:45.080]  duty is ours consequence belongs to God it is our responsibility the spirit of God and
[1:29:45.080 --> 1:29:50.360]  life and love and goodness is not in us if we don't have a compulsion to stand up against
[1:29:50.360 --> 1:30:00.800]  evil we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[1:37:16.040 --> 1:37:19.680]  he invited me up to dallas but he's got to make sure he has the time so i'm probably
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:24.040]  gonna get a face-to-face video interview with dave mustain a megadeth who's now become a
[1:37:24.040 --> 1:37:30.760]  christian and who now named his new album that's already hit number one on the charts

[1:42:45.840 --> 1:42:47.840]  and crock-o-probe agenda, sir.
[1:42:47.840 --> 1:42:49.840]  The New Old Order will fail,
[1:42:49.840 --> 1:42:51.840]  and we realize that this is against our sovereignty.
[1:42:51.840 --> 1:42:54.840]  I have a First Amendment right. You do not need to assault me, sir.
[1:42:54.840 --> 1:42:56.840]  I am leaving. I am leaving.
[1:42:56.840 --> 1:42:58.840]  You do not need to assault me, sir.
[1:42:58.840 --> 1:43:00.840]  I have a First Amendment right.
[1:43:00.840 --> 1:43:03.840]  This man wants to create a centralized global government.
[1:43:03.840 --> 1:43:05.840]  31,000 scientists.
[1:43:05.840 --> 1:43:08.840]  That man is... this is Nazi fascism.
[1:43:08.840 --> 1:43:10.840]  Who are you?
[1:43:10.840 --> 1:43:12.840]  Any comments on climate-gate?
[1:43:12.840 --> 1:43:14.840]  The emails that prove it's a scam?
[1:43:14.840 --> 1:43:16.840]  It's a farce? Global warming? It's a joke?
[1:43:16.840 --> 1:43:18.840]  Any comment? Comment on climate-gate?
[1:43:18.840 --> 1:43:20.840]  Climate-gate? First Amendment right here.
[1:43:20.840 --> 1:43:22.840]  Climate-gate! Climate-gate!
[1:43:22.840 --> 1:43:24.840]  Research! Climate-gate!
[1:43:24.840 --> 1:43:26.840]  This guy's a fraud! It's a scam!
[1:43:26.840 --> 1:43:29.840]  They are trying to institute a global government
[1:43:29.840 --> 1:43:31.840]  through a carbon tax!
[1:43:31.840 --> 1:43:34.840]  This guy's working on a carbon tax!
[1:43:34.840 --> 1:43:36.840]  That's all it is! It's global government!
[1:43:36.840 --> 1:43:39.840]  There are 30,000 scientists trying to sue this guy!
[1:43:39.840 --> 1:43:42.840]  John Coleman, the founder of the Weather Channel,
[1:43:42.840 --> 1:43:44.840]  is suing this bum!
[1:43:44.840 --> 1:43:46.840]  You are online for this bum!
[1:43:46.840 --> 1:43:49.840]  It's a global government! Get your hands off me!
[1:43:49.840 --> 1:43:52.840]  First Amendment rights! Get your hands off me!
[1:43:55.840 --> 1:43:57.840]  Let's talk about carbon pollutants. You talk about them.
[1:43:57.840 --> 1:44:00.840]  It's my understanding that back in 1997,
[1:44:00.840 --> 1:44:02.840]  when you were Vice President,
[1:44:02.840 --> 1:44:05.840]  CEO Ken Lay was involved in discussions with you
[1:44:05.840 --> 1:44:07.840]  at the White House about helping develop
[1:44:07.840 --> 1:44:10.840]  this type of policy, this trading scheme.
[1:44:10.840 --> 1:44:13.840]  Is that accurate? Is it inaccurate?
[1:44:13.840 --> 1:44:15.840]  It's been recorded.
[1:44:15.840 --> 1:44:34.840]  I don't know.
[1:44:34.840 --> 1:44:36.840]  Unbelievable!
[1:44:36.840 --> 1:44:39.840]  This is the spirit of victory.
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:44.840]  This is the spirit that will defeat the tyranny.
[1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:46.840]  In searching for a new enemy to unite us,
[1:44:46.840 --> 1:44:48.840]  we came up with the idea that population,
[1:44:48.840 --> 1:44:50.840]  the threat of global warming,
[1:44:50.840 --> 1:44:52.840]  water shortages, famine and the like,
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:54.840]  would fit the bill and these dangers
[1:44:54.840 --> 1:44:56.840]  are caused by human intervention.
[1:44:56.840 --> 1:45:01.840]  If you believe that the reason I have been
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:04.840]  working on this issue for 30 years
[1:45:04.840 --> 1:45:07.840]  is because of greed,
[1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:09.840]  you don't know me.
[1:45:09.840 --> 1:45:12.840]  Thank you, y'all!
[1:45:12.840 --> 1:45:15.840]  Everything's going to be fine.
[1:45:18.840 --> 1:45:19.840]  Hey, Al!
[1:45:19.840 --> 1:45:21.840]  Alright, alright, thank you.
[1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:23.840]  You guys stay back over here for a minute.
[1:45:23.840 --> 1:45:34.840]  Yes!
[1:45:34.840 --> 1:45:41.840]  Everywhere he goes, inside, outside.
[1:45:41.840 --> 1:45:44.840]  Trader.
[1:45:44.840 --> 1:45:46.840]  This is how tyranny falls.
[1:45:46.840 --> 1:45:49.840]  This is true revolution.
[1:45:49.840 --> 1:45:51.840]  Oh, I just want to hug we are changed
[1:45:51.840 --> 1:45:52.840]  Ohio and Chicago.
[1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:54.840]  Now they're at his car.
[1:45:54.840 --> 1:46:01.840]  Yeah!
[1:46:01.840 --> 1:46:08.840]  Running that rat to ground.
[1:46:08.840 --> 1:46:11.840]  Man, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:13.840]  everywhere he goes, bigger crowds,
[1:46:13.840 --> 1:46:15.840]  more people confronting him,
[1:46:15.840 --> 1:46:16.840]  Climate Gate.
[1:46:16.840 --> 1:46:18.840]  They had multiple people split up,
[1:46:18.840 --> 1:46:19.840]  so as they grabbed one group,
[1:46:19.840 --> 1:46:20.840]  another group would activate.
[1:46:20.840 --> 1:46:22.840]  No way to stop this.
[1:46:22.840 --> 1:46:24.840]  All those hundreds of fools there at the book
[1:46:24.840 --> 1:46:26.840]  signing that the mainstream media have been
[1:46:26.840 --> 1:46:27.840]  promoting.
[1:46:27.840 --> 1:46:29.840]  Gore's been all over mainline TV dramas,
[1:46:29.840 --> 1:46:31.840]  sitcoms, promoting his lies,
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:33.840]  telling people to pass laws.
[1:46:33.840 --> 1:46:35.840]  This is government paid for propaganda.
[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:37.840]  Your tax money on TV,
[1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:39.840]  with him brainwashing the public,
[1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:41.840]  making him this big celebrity.
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:43.840]  Just like they made Obama this celebrity
[1:46:43.840 --> 1:46:45.840]  to sell all this garbage.
[1:46:45.840 --> 1:46:47.840]  Just like they made Bush a celebrity
[1:46:47.840 --> 1:46:49.840]  with TV shows to push the police state.
[1:46:49.840 --> 1:46:52.840]  Everywhere he goes.
[1:46:52.840 --> 1:46:54.840]  And now the link between
[1:46:54.840 --> 1:46:56.840]  manmade global warming
[1:46:56.840 --> 1:46:58.840]  and the global carbon tax
[1:46:58.840 --> 1:47:00.840]  and global government and eugenics
[1:47:00.840 --> 1:47:02.840]  is now being made
[1:47:02.840 --> 1:47:04.840]  and everyone is starting to talk about it.
[1:47:04.840 --> 1:47:06.840]  Everyone is starting to talk about eco science
[1:47:06.840 --> 1:47:07.840]  written by the White House.
[1:47:07.840 --> 1:47:09.840]  Science are calling for exterminating
[1:47:09.840 --> 1:47:11.840]  the majority of the population.
[1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:12.840]  The signal is getting out.
[1:47:12.840 --> 1:47:14.840]  The truth, the full magnitude
[1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:15.840]  is now coming out.
[1:47:15.840 --> 1:47:18.840]  Thanks to you, the listeners of this radio show.
[1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:20.840]  And every one of you,
[1:47:20.840 --> 1:47:22.840]  look at Luke Radowski, 19 years old,
[1:47:22.840 --> 1:47:24.840]  gets kicked out of 9-Eleven Truth in New York
[1:47:24.840 --> 1:47:26.840]  because he wanted to go after the New World Order.
[1:47:26.840 --> 1:47:28.840]  I told him, I said,
[1:47:28.840 --> 1:47:30.840]  man, go start your own organization.
[1:47:30.840 --> 1:47:32.840]  We're going to support you.
[1:47:32.840 --> 1:47:34.840]  Other people picked up on it.
[1:47:34.840 --> 1:47:36.840]  The zenith of all of this
[1:47:36.840 --> 1:47:38.840]  or the inception
[1:47:38.840 --> 1:47:40.840]  was our listeners
[1:47:40.840 --> 1:47:42.840]  flocking to the term we are changing.
[1:47:42.840 --> 1:47:44.840]  Luke spreading these organizations everywhere
[1:47:44.840 --> 1:47:46.840]  that don't have leaders,
[1:47:46.840 --> 1:47:48.840]  don't have a classical organization.
[1:47:48.840 --> 1:47:50.840]  It's an idea, not left, not right,
[1:47:50.840 --> 1:47:52.840]  but freedom and truth
[1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:54.840]  and honor.
[1:47:54.840 --> 1:47:56.840]  And this is the true populism,
[1:47:56.840 --> 1:47:58.840]  the true constitutional populism
[1:47:58.840 --> 1:48:00.840]  that will defeat the New World Order.
[1:48:00.840 --> 1:48:02.840]  You're watching nails
[1:48:02.840 --> 1:48:04.840]  in the coffin of the New World Order
[1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:06.840]  when you see video like that.
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:08.840]  This is just so unbelievably powerful.
[1:48:08.840 --> 1:48:10.840]  And I wrote some other notes during that video.
[1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:12.840]  Notice Al Gore will not debate Lord Monkton
[1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:14.840]  or the founder of the Weather Channel
[1:48:14.840 --> 1:48:16.840]  or all these meteorologists
[1:48:16.840 --> 1:48:18.840]  or the 30 plus thousand top scientists
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:20.840]  against the UN's 2,500
[1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:22.840]  only less than 100 are real climatologists
[1:48:22.840 --> 1:48:24.840]  and they've all been caught in emails
[1:48:24.840 --> 1:48:26.840]  as fraud lying.
[1:48:26.840 --> 1:48:28.840]  They are desperate to keep the lid on this
[1:48:28.840 --> 1:48:30.840]  but the lid is already blown wide open.
[1:48:30.840 --> 1:48:32.840]  The genies out of the bottle,
[1:48:32.840 --> 1:48:34.840]  the horse left the barn a long time ago
[1:48:34.840 --> 1:48:36.840]  but the more they try to cover this up,
[1:48:36.840 --> 1:48:38.840]  the more they try to hold it down.
[1:48:38.840 --> 1:48:40.840]  I mean, oh, just the way they did that was perfect.
[1:48:40.840 --> 1:48:42.840]  I salute you.
[1:48:42.840 --> 1:48:44.840]  Thank you.
[1:48:44.840 --> 1:48:46.840]  I thank all of you.
[1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:48.840]  This is just so wonderful.
[1:48:48.840 --> 1:48:50.840]  And everybody's looking up online.
[1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:52.840]  We're mentioning on air where Al Gore is next.
[1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:54.840]  Let's look up Al Gore
[1:48:54.840 --> 1:48:56.840]  his itinerary.
[1:48:56.840 --> 1:48:58.840]  And I know they're not even really listing that on his site now
[1:48:58.840 --> 1:49:00.840]  hoping people won't show up. They just locally promote it.
[1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:02.840]  Doesn't matter. We have listeners.
[1:49:02.840 --> 1:49:04.840]  We have activists. We have freedom lovers everywhere
[1:49:04.840 --> 1:49:06.840]  that understand that Al Gore isn't screwing up.
[1:49:06.840 --> 1:49:08.840]  Al Gore isn't dumb.
[1:49:08.840 --> 1:49:10.840]  Al Gore is an environmentalist
[1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:12.840]  and Al Gore is a low tree hugger.
[1:49:12.840 --> 1:49:14.840]  That would be okay because we do have real environmental problems.
[1:49:14.840 --> 1:49:16.840]  Al Gore is a eugenicist.
[1:49:16.840 --> 1:49:18.840]  Openly, I was reading the Maury Strong
[1:49:18.840 --> 1:49:20.840]  UN quotes that are in the film
[1:49:20.840 --> 1:49:22.840]  from the club of Rome
[1:49:22.840 --> 1:49:24.840]  where they said we're going to make humankind the enemy.
[1:49:24.840 --> 1:49:26.840]  That cue that video
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:28.840]  back up for me. It's about three minutes
[1:49:28.840 --> 1:49:30.840]  till the end where it shows the quote.
[1:49:30.840 --> 1:49:32.840]  I want to read that full quote as we go out
[1:49:32.840 --> 1:49:34.840]  to break to people because I didn't have time to read it all.
[1:49:34.840 --> 1:49:36.840]  Where they say
[1:49:36.840 --> 1:49:38.840]  we are going to
[1:49:38.840 --> 1:49:40.840]  make humanity the enemy
[1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:42.840]  and the government will direct the war against humanity.
[1:49:42.840 --> 1:49:44.840]  This is a war economy
[1:49:44.840 --> 1:49:46.840]  run by the government, run by the internal
[1:49:46.840 --> 1:49:48.840]  police forces,
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:50.840]  the Stasi forces they've set up
[1:49:50.840 --> 1:49:52.840]  to carry out eugenics.
[1:49:52.840 --> 1:49:54.840]  That's what Hitler was.
[1:49:54.840 --> 1:49:56.840]  And if the truth about this gets out
[1:49:56.840 --> 1:49:58.840]  if anybody reads what Al Gore actually says
[1:49:58.840 --> 1:50:00.840]  or Maury Strong
[1:50:00.840 --> 1:50:02.840]  or
[1:50:02.840 --> 1:50:04.840]  all these other globalists, John P. Holdren
[1:50:04.840 --> 1:50:06.840]  if people actually read what they've said
[1:50:06.840 --> 1:50:08.840]  what they've done
[1:50:08.840 --> 1:50:10.840]  it is over for these people.
[1:50:10.840 --> 1:50:12.840]  Here I'll read the quote.
[1:50:12.840 --> 1:50:14.840]  The first global revolution
[1:50:14.840 --> 1:50:16.840]  in 1991 published by the club of Rome
[1:50:16.840 --> 1:50:18.840]  a globalist think tank
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:20.840]  in searching for a new enemy to unite us
[1:50:20.840 --> 1:50:22.840]  we came up with the idea that population
[1:50:22.840 --> 1:50:24.840]  the threat of global warming rather than
[1:50:24.840 --> 1:50:26.840]  and water shortages, famine
[1:50:26.840 --> 1:50:28.840]  and the like would fit the bill.
[1:50:28.840 --> 1:50:30.840]  All these dangers are caused by human intervention.
[1:50:30.840 --> 1:50:32.840]  The real enemy then is humanity itself.
[1:50:32.840 --> 1:50:34.840]  And they go on to say
[1:50:34.840 --> 1:50:36.840]  that
[1:50:36.840 --> 1:50:38.840]  they're going to use fake terror to take our
[1:50:38.840 --> 1:50:40.840]  rights on one end and fake environmentalism
[1:50:40.840 --> 1:50:42.840]  to take our resources on the other
[1:50:42.840 --> 1:50:44.840]  to make us totally bankrupt and dependent
[1:50:44.840 --> 1:50:46.840]  on them. They want you dependent
[1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:48.840]  not so they can enslave you
[1:50:48.840 --> 1:50:50.840]  but so they can kill you
[1:50:50.840 --> 1:50:52.840]  with forced inoculations, with poisons in the water
[1:50:52.840 --> 1:50:54.840]  like John P. Holdren calls for
[1:50:54.840 --> 1:50:56.840]  the White House science are
[1:50:56.840 --> 1:50:58.840]  who's also manipulating the weather
[1:50:58.840 --> 1:51:00.840]  he admits that the Associated Press.
[1:51:00.840 --> 1:51:02.840]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know
[1:51:02.840 --> 1:51:04.840]  that the global elite are now storing
[1:51:04.840 --> 1:51:06.840]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults
[1:51:06.840 --> 1:51:08.840]  near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in
[1:51:08.840 --> 1:51:10.840]  a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds
[1:51:10.840 --> 1:51:12.840]  could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[1:51:12.840 --> 1:51:14.840]  It's true, seeds don't perform even gold
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:16.840]  and silver before in this country and it's possible
[1:51:16.840 --> 1:51:18.840]  that could even happen again.
[1:51:18.840 --> 1:51:20.840]  So our friends at Solutions from Science

[1:58:58.240 --> 1:58:59.960]  How much ammunition do you want?
[1:58:59.960 --> 1:59:02.000]  My answer would be all I can get.
[1:59:02.000 --> 1:59:07.040]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[1:59:07.040 --> 1:59:08.280]  How much do you want?
[1:59:08.280 --> 1:59:09.280]  When do you want it?
[1:59:09.280 --> 1:59:11.280]  Now or after the battle starts.
[1:59:11.280 --> 1:59:12.440]  When will you need it?
[1:59:12.440 --> 1:59:14.560]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:59:14.560 --> 1:59:15.880]  Will there be any food?
[1:59:15.880 --> 1:59:17.360]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:59:17.360 --> 1:59:21.480]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:59:21.480 --> 1:59:22.640]  and be immunized?
[1:59:22.640 --> 1:59:26.440]  Will you wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply?
[1:59:26.440 --> 1:59:30.040]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:59:30.040 --> 1:59:31.280]  How much will you need?
[1:59:31.280 --> 1:59:32.280]  We don't know.
[1:59:32.280 --> 1:59:33.280]  How much do you want?
[1:59:33.280 --> 1:59:34.280]  All you can get.
[1:59:34.280 --> 1:59:35.280]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:59:35.280 --> 1:59:38.360]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[1:59:54.000 --> 2:00:05.880]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.880 --> 2:00:10.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:00:10.680 --> 2:00:11.680]  You want answers?
[2:00:11.680 --> 2:00:13.560]  Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.560 --> 2:00:18.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:23.200]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.200 --> 2:00:25.320]  I start thinking about the Climate Gate emails.
[2:00:25.320 --> 2:00:29.040]  We're only a week and a half into this and it's devastating the New World Order.
[2:00:29.040 --> 2:00:35.480]  The key to their whole global taxing system, the heart of the New World Order neofutalistic
[2:00:35.480 --> 2:00:39.640]  surf eugenics grid being exposed.
[2:00:39.640 --> 2:00:45.720]  I think about Al Gore being eloquently shouted down as a criminal, as a fraud, as a eugenicist
[2:00:45.720 --> 2:00:46.720]  kingpin.
[2:00:46.720 --> 2:00:54.360]  Everywhere he goes, it just makes me happy.
[2:00:54.360 --> 2:00:57.920]  You know, we've done so much in this audience teaching people how much power they have and
[2:00:57.920 --> 2:01:00.000]  showing them how to take action.
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:04.440]  And I'm not giving myself credit for this, even though we deserve a lot of it.
[2:01:04.440 --> 2:01:08.440]  I'm trying to show people the power they have and the effect we're having and how much this
[2:01:08.440 --> 2:01:09.440]  could grow.
[2:01:09.440 --> 2:01:11.560]  I mean, you think things have grown in resistance.
[2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:22.640]  We've only begun the parabolic rate straight up, up, up and away, in through and beyond.
[2:01:22.640 --> 2:01:26.120]  I mean, I'm going to keep driving and pushing and hammering as hard as I can.
[2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:31.280]  But at this point, I could pretty much walk away from this.
[2:01:31.280 --> 2:01:36.920]  And what we've done just in this audience, with this great audience taking action, is
[2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:39.760]  a serious blow to the New World Order.
[2:01:39.760 --> 2:01:42.320]  So many people have shattered the left-right paradigm.
[2:01:42.320 --> 2:01:45.880]  They understand the globalist system and they've read their documents.
[2:01:45.880 --> 2:01:48.720]  The explosive growth curve of knowledge is now happening.
[2:01:48.720 --> 2:01:54.640]  I know where that leads because I've gone down that road myself.
[2:01:54.640 --> 2:01:59.120]  People are becoming enlightened right now and I can feel the spirit of victory and liberty
[2:01:59.120 --> 2:02:01.600]  and freedom rising.
[2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:10.280]  Man, surfs up, ladies and gentlemen, catch the wave, fighting the New World Order.
[2:02:10.280 --> 2:02:16.880]  Oh, man, I'm literally having endorphin right now, which I rarely get in endorphin rushes
[2:02:16.880 --> 2:02:19.760]  on political issues because I'm just so focused.
[2:02:19.760 --> 2:02:24.920]  But I mean, all these years, 14 years fighting them, I can't imagine what the adrenaline rush
[2:02:24.920 --> 2:02:25.920]  is like for G.F.
[2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:29.320]  We're Griffin, by the way, who Thursday is going to be in studio with us.
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:33.600]  I can't imagine what it's like for people like Bob Chapman.
[2:02:33.600 --> 2:02:40.160]  Now, Charlie Sheen and I talk about the incredible rush we get doing the right thing.
[2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:45.200]  What was that quote that Chris Garcia, winner of the 20 Men's for the President contest,
[2:02:45.200 --> 2:02:47.200]  what was that quote?
[2:02:47.200 --> 2:02:52.680]  He quoted me about, there's no rush like fighting tyranny.
[2:02:52.680 --> 2:02:54.600]  I mean, that's not my exact quote.
[2:02:54.600 --> 2:03:01.400]  I can't remember my own quotes, this stuff just comes out of me, but, oh, man, I want
[2:03:01.400 --> 2:03:03.640]  to, I need to make it.
[2:03:03.640 --> 2:03:05.240]  There's no high like fighting tyranny.
[2:03:05.240 --> 2:03:10.360]  Yeah, that's not the exact quote.
[2:03:10.360 --> 2:03:14.600]  Oh, it didn't matter.
[2:03:14.600 --> 2:03:21.720]  It's in the interview with him from Charlie Sheen yesterday, but it's almost more exhausting
[2:03:21.720 --> 2:03:28.240]  having this much exhilaration because they're just piles of evil, piles of evidence that
[2:03:28.240 --> 2:03:33.200]  these are criminals, but we'll continue to chronicle their criminal activities like the
[2:03:33.200 --> 2:03:39.320]  founding fathers did in the 15 years before the Revolutionary War in 1775, 1776 with their
[2:03:39.320 --> 2:03:40.640]  committees of correspondence.
[2:03:40.640 --> 2:03:47.200]  But we're now beginning to transfer and transition away from just exposing them to the public
[2:03:47.200 --> 2:03:48.840]  knows they're a bunch of crooks.
[2:03:48.840 --> 2:03:50.000]  How do we bring these people down?
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:54.360]  Well, you go out and confront them everywhere, you shout them down, you expose them, you
[2:03:54.360 --> 2:04:01.240]  wake up the sheeple that aren't awake because they're ready to be awakened right now.
[2:04:01.240 --> 2:04:04.400]  I want to go to Mike, Joe, Thomas, Dan, Mike and others.
[2:04:04.400 --> 2:04:08.560]  They just all ask great questions, probing questions that are exhausting to answer, but
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:09.560]  I'm going to do it.
[2:04:09.560 --> 2:04:14.080]  I mean, I'm really exhausted right now, but it feels like I just played a football game
[2:04:14.080 --> 2:04:26.040]  and we won and I'm meeting my cheerleader girlfriend in the parking lot, you know, but
[2:04:26.040 --> 2:04:31.000]  the battle, the battle, the battle isn't over, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:04:31.000 --> 2:04:33.000]  We're just beginning to win victories.
[2:04:33.000 --> 2:04:37.360]  We're still bloodied and in deep trouble and we better treat this like it's life and death
[2:04:37.360 --> 2:04:39.480]  because it is, but that's the victory.
[2:04:39.480 --> 2:04:42.720]  The people are starting to figure out this is eugenics we're facing.
[2:04:42.720 --> 2:04:44.400]  This is mass Nazism.
[2:04:44.400 --> 2:04:47.440]  This is new world order.
[2:04:47.440 --> 2:04:57.480]  They're really starting to get just how monumental and big this is for all of you out there fighting
[2:04:57.480 --> 2:04:58.480]  tyranny.
[2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:01.000]  I salute you.
[2:05:01.000 --> 2:05:05.680]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[2:05:05.680 --> 2:05:06.680]  you to eat.
[2:05:06.680 --> 2:05:10.200]  Will you continue to be their profit center buying their processed food that makes you
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:11.200]  sick?
[2:05:11.200 --> 2:05:13.120]  Doctored and buy their drugs?
[2:05:13.120 --> 2:05:14.760]  You don't have to cooperate.
[2:05:14.760 --> 2:05:16.080]  There is a solution.
[2:05:16.080 --> 2:05:19.640]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing

[2:07:00.720 --> 2:07:05.360]  This is Alex Jones with 5 Good Reasons You Should Consider Buying a Solar Power Generator.
[2:07:05.360 --> 2:07:09.680]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[2:07:09.680 --> 2:07:14.000]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:15.280]  allows you to have.
[2:07:15.280 --> 2:07:21.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[2:07:21.000 --> 2:07:25.360]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[2:07:25.360 --> 2:07:29.360]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[2:07:29.360 --> 2:07:32.840]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[2:07:32.840 --> 2:07:36.520]  Over a year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[2:07:36.520 --> 2:07:41.320]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[2:07:41.320 --> 2:07:45.080]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[2:07:45.080 --> 2:07:46.480]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[2:07:46.480 --> 2:07:50.720]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[2:07:50.720 --> 2:07:52.320]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:07:52.320 --> 2:08:03.040]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[2:08:03.040 --> 2:08:09.600]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:16.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:20.760]  Our country and much of the world was captured by the global banking syndicate a long time
[2:08:20.760 --> 2:08:23.640]  ago.
[2:08:23.640 --> 2:08:29.320]  But now the people are awakening to the fact that we are occupied by a criminal banking
[2:08:29.320 --> 2:08:32.800]  elite that controls both political parties.
[2:08:32.800 --> 2:08:36.120]  So whatever political parties out of power, they will oppose the New World Order, but
[2:08:36.120 --> 2:08:37.120]  only on the surface.
[2:08:37.120 --> 2:08:41.480]  And whatever political parties in power, they will continue whatever agenda the last party
[2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:47.680]  had with different political window dressing to create the illusion of choice.
[2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:53.160]  But to see the public shattering this illusion and to see it like a wild brush fire raging,
[2:08:53.160 --> 2:08:57.480]  as Thomas Jefferson talked about, is exhilarating.
[2:08:57.480 --> 2:09:02.760]  I have never gotten a comprehensive list of We Are Change groups and other groups.
[2:09:02.760 --> 2:09:06.360]  They're always contacting us, and I have such limited staff, we never save their numbers
[2:09:06.360 --> 2:09:07.360]  or info.
[2:09:07.360 --> 2:09:11.240]  I know I've had the Colorado We Are Change on, we've had Florida We Are Change on that
[2:09:11.240 --> 2:09:15.200]  have been confronting Al Gore, we've had Chicago We Are Change, Ohio on in the past.
[2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:18.520]  Then we've got to look for their numbers and emails and we can't find them.
[2:09:18.520 --> 2:09:22.440]  If you're We Are Change, and I want to get them on this week, I want to get Luke on
[2:09:22.440 --> 2:09:26.500]  with them, do like an hour and a half with the We Are Change groups that have been confronting
[2:09:26.500 --> 2:09:28.000]  Al Gore.
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  I know Luke's number, obviously.
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:36.360]  I want to get five, six, seven, eight people on to talk about strategy and future operations.
[2:09:36.360 --> 2:09:39.240]  So email Craig at infowars.com.
[2:09:39.240 --> 2:09:42.600]  I've got Craig on this, so we get your numbers and emails so we can stay in contact with
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:43.600]  you.
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:46.680]  What happens is you call us, you email us, and then I think a week later, how do I find
[2:09:46.680 --> 2:09:47.680]  their number?
[2:09:47.680 --> 2:09:52.920]  And there's literally 20,000 emails in a week and a half, and I'm trying to find them.
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:59.200]  It's kind of like we're kicking the New World Order's hind end in, but their political
[2:09:59.200 --> 2:10:04.040]  bodies are stacking up so high we can barely find room to fight because there's so many
[2:10:04.040 --> 2:10:06.560]  of them.
[2:10:06.560 --> 2:10:11.520]  All right, I said I'm going to cover all this news, but I also said I was going to take
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:15.480]  your call, so let's continue with your calls right now.
[2:10:15.480 --> 2:10:17.280]  Mike in Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:18.280]  Go ahead.
[2:10:18.280 --> 2:10:19.280]  Alex.
[2:10:19.280 --> 2:10:20.280]  Hey, buddy.
[2:10:20.280 --> 2:10:21.280]  Hey, how's it going?
[2:10:21.280 --> 2:10:22.280]  Good.
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:23.280]  I'm honored.
[2:10:23.280 --> 2:10:24.680]  It's an honor.
[2:10:24.680 --> 2:10:31.240]  I just want to say that the Lyre and Chief is going to be in Allentown, Pennsylvania Friday,
[2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:32.640]  December 4th.
[2:10:32.640 --> 2:10:38.000]  He's doing his White House to Main Street tour, and I just hope that maybe some of the
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:41.480]  listeners, like We Are Change, I hope they show up.
[2:10:41.480 --> 2:10:47.400]  And we get some people down there to maybe, you know, he's supposed to be there all day.
[2:10:47.400 --> 2:10:48.400]  Details are a little sketchy.
[2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:51.960]  I'm trying to figure out what his itinerary is going to be, but...
[2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:56.360]  And remember, he said he wasn't going to Copenhagen, but now he is.
[2:10:56.360 --> 2:10:57.360]  I know.
[2:10:57.360 --> 2:11:01.960]  They always do that to kill opposition, so nobody shows up, then he still shows up himself.
[2:11:01.960 --> 2:11:07.840]  Well, I hope he's going to show up in Allentown because I'm going down there, and I hope some
[2:11:07.840 --> 2:11:12.400]  people show up with some signs and, you know, call him the Lyre that he is.
[2:11:12.400 --> 2:11:14.520]  He's got his little press conference tomorrow.
[2:11:14.520 --> 2:11:17.280]  I mean, there's so much that you can get this guy on.
[2:11:17.280 --> 2:11:18.280]  It's not even funny.
[2:11:18.280 --> 2:11:20.760]  You know, Copenhagen, no jobs.
[2:11:20.760 --> 2:11:22.960]  We're losing our houses.
[2:11:22.960 --> 2:11:24.120]  The wars.
[2:11:24.120 --> 2:11:25.120]  Yeah.
[2:11:25.120 --> 2:11:29.960]  Keeping the Patriot Act, expanding secret arrest and torture, warrantless wiretapping,
[2:11:29.960 --> 2:11:36.720]  hiring nothing but lobbyist, spending more money than all presidents before him combined
[2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:38.200]  in less than one year.
[2:11:38.200 --> 2:11:45.280]  I thought that was hard to do with Bush doing it, and four years or eight years, you know.
[2:11:45.280 --> 2:11:50.920]  But yeah, December 4th, Allentown, Pennsylvania, people show up.
[2:11:50.920 --> 2:11:51.920]  God bless you, sir.
[2:11:51.920 --> 2:11:52.920]  Take care.
[2:11:52.920 --> 2:11:56.800]  And there'll be a lot of people out there protesting him, but don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[2:11:56.800 --> 2:12:03.680]  Just get out there, and if you're one person, a minority of one is a majority morally, and
[2:12:03.680 --> 2:12:06.080]  you'll end up being in the paper.
[2:12:06.080 --> 2:12:12.080]  Again, if we don't go out and confront these liars, they have the field to themselves.
[2:12:12.080 --> 2:12:13.080]  Resistance is victory.
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:19.720]  I hate to sound like a broken record here, but Joe in Illinois, you're on the air, Joe.
[2:12:19.720 --> 2:12:20.720]  Hey, Alex.
[2:12:20.720 --> 2:12:21.720]  How you doing?
[2:12:21.720 --> 2:12:25.680]  What does you think of that audio slash video we just played of Al Gore being routed like
[2:12:25.680 --> 2:12:27.160]  the piggy is?
[2:12:27.160 --> 2:12:28.360]  Hey, God bless.
[2:12:28.360 --> 2:12:30.400]  We are Chicago, those brothers.
[2:12:30.400 --> 2:12:33.240]  I want to get with them next time they do something like that.
[2:12:33.240 --> 2:12:34.240]  Yes.
[2:12:34.240 --> 2:12:36.280]  The lyrics join with them.
[2:12:36.280 --> 2:12:37.280]  Yeah.
[2:12:37.280 --> 2:12:43.600]  But anyway, I'm a first-time caller, long-time listener, and I've kind of took all the knowledge
[2:12:43.600 --> 2:12:50.760]  I've gained from listening to your show and put it in the form of this poetic literature.
[2:12:50.760 --> 2:12:55.480]  Feel free to use it, or even, you said Dave Mustaine from Megadeth.
[2:12:55.480 --> 2:12:59.160]  I think he would be down with these lyrics that I got here.
[2:12:59.160 --> 2:13:00.560]  Are you ready?
[2:13:00.560 --> 2:13:01.560]  Lay it on me.
[2:13:01.560 --> 2:13:02.560]  All right.
[2:13:02.560 --> 2:13:03.560]  It's called Rulers.
[2:13:03.560 --> 2:13:09.320]  Rulers want to rule the world in the name of the moon and the sun, in the name of this
[2:13:09.320 --> 2:13:14.600]  tar, ishtar, red star, dog star, in the name of Mars and Jupiter.
[2:13:14.600 --> 2:13:16.640]  They can't get any stupider.
[2:13:16.640 --> 2:13:19.800]  Pike and Analucius are just a couple of the douches.
[2:13:19.800 --> 2:13:25.880]  Nixon, Hitler, Darwin, Mussolini, Mengele, Kissinger, Kim Jong, and Ben Bernanke.
[2:13:25.880 --> 2:13:29.160]  Eastbound travelers, square men on the level.
[2:13:29.160 --> 2:13:33.080]  Given the chance to rule the world, they make the deals with the devil.
[2:13:33.080 --> 2:13:38.720]  Rothschilds, Rockefeller, Samorgans, and the Chases, Bilderberger's all, whom Satan
[2:13:38.720 --> 2:13:40.240]  put in places.
[2:13:40.240 --> 2:13:49.240]  Stalin, Osama, Obama, Gaddafi, Blackpope, Whitepope, Mafia, Illuminati, CIA, OTO, FBI,
[2:13:49.240 --> 2:13:54.840]  NWO, ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX.
[2:13:54.840 --> 2:13:55.840]  That's 666.
[2:13:55.840 --> 2:13:57.080]  Don't you know?
[2:13:57.080 --> 2:13:58.080]  Three-digit code.
[2:13:58.080 --> 2:14:00.080]  That's how they roll.
[2:14:00.080 --> 2:14:10.160]  H1N1, HIV, MF-59, and LSD, hormones in the water, poison in the air, mercury in the vaccines,
[2:14:10.160 --> 2:14:12.480]  and toxins everywhere.
[2:14:12.480 --> 2:14:17.680]  Places called Bohemian Grove, or the Thousand Poets of Light, is where they meet with their
[2:14:17.680 --> 2:14:21.160]  God to plot their schemes of blight.
[2:14:21.160 --> 2:14:26.760]  They place their credos at the crossroads in plain sight for all to see, their evil plans
[2:14:26.760 --> 2:14:30.440]  of ruling the world and destroying humanity.
[2:14:30.440 --> 2:14:35.880]  These are the places they're bestowed their title, Masters, 33rd Degree.
[2:14:35.880 --> 2:14:41.160]  But the light for which they sold their souls was so blinding they could no longer see.
[2:14:41.160 --> 2:14:46.560]  Now they're empty, heartless, broken vessels to which Satan owns the deed.
[2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:51.040]  Angry, evil, wicked men who love to make us bleed.
[2:14:51.040 --> 2:14:54.560]  These are the men who roll the world and make the policies.
[2:14:54.560 --> 2:14:59.800]  Made by the light, feeble-minded Napoleons who can no longer even see.
[2:14:59.800 --> 2:15:04.560]  If rulers didn't rule the world and just left the world to be with disease and unchecked
[2:15:04.560 --> 2:15:10.880]  population, destroy humanity, or would we just live and thrive in peace and harmony?
[2:15:10.880 --> 2:15:15.440]  Some say a world without rulers would lead to anarchy, but I believe a world with no
[2:15:15.440 --> 2:15:18.680]  rulers is a world where men are free.
[2:15:18.680 --> 2:15:22.240]  Why you want to take my gun and stick that flu shot in me?
[2:15:22.240 --> 2:15:26.680]  Why must I wait in line to be issued a national ID?
[2:15:26.680 --> 2:15:29.920]  Why must I give my money to an insurance company?
[2:15:29.920 --> 2:15:34.840]  Why can't I just live and die as an American, brave and free?
[2:15:34.840 --> 2:15:35.840]  That's it, brother.
[2:15:35.840 --> 2:15:37.480]  Well, that's beautiful.
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:41.200]  You should at least go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.
[2:15:41.200 --> 2:15:46.520]  A lot of poetry and spoken word gets posted in the comment sections.
[2:15:46.520 --> 2:15:50.520]  And why don't you go post that in the Al Gore video that we have linked up from We Are
[2:15:50.520 --> 2:15:55.560]  Change Chicago so people can read that so it has a record there online.
[2:15:55.560 --> 2:15:56.560]  Very beautiful.
[2:15:56.560 --> 2:15:57.560]  Good job.
[2:15:57.560 --> 2:15:58.560]  Good to hear from you.
[2:15:58.560 --> 2:15:59.560]  Let's take another call here.
[2:15:59.560 --> 2:16:05.520]  Let's talk to Thomas in Connecticut, speaking of Luciferianism up there by Skull and Bones
[2:16:05.520 --> 2:16:06.520]  in New Haven.
[2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:07.520]  Go ahead.
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:08.520]  You're on the air, Thomas.
[2:16:08.520 --> 2:16:10.520]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[2:16:10.520 --> 2:16:11.520]  Good.
[2:16:11.520 --> 2:16:12.520]  Listen, I'm a new listener.
[2:16:12.520 --> 2:16:16.840]  I've been listening for a couple of weeks now and I want to say that I'm, first of all,
[2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:20.960]  thank you very much for this alternative that you've given to the regular news.
[2:16:20.960 --> 2:16:26.960]  I've been listening, obviously, to the regular news channels, ABC, CBS, NBC for years.
[2:16:26.960 --> 2:16:31.160]  I've been involved in politics and I've been looking at the left-right paradigm you talk
[2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:32.160]  about so often.
[2:16:32.160 --> 2:16:34.280]  It just doesn't make sense to me.
[2:16:34.280 --> 2:16:39.680]  When I look at the left, I see this ultra-ultralibras, not entirely, but I see majority.
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:45.240]  Now, to the right, and I see people that espouse, quote, free markets and so forth,
[2:16:45.240 --> 2:16:52.280]  like Limbaugh, but then, and I mean that, but they talk about nothing about protection
[2:16:52.280 --> 2:16:53.280]  for the people.
[2:16:53.280 --> 2:16:55.640]  And I'm not for, I'm for the middle road.
[2:16:55.640 --> 2:16:57.880]  I mean, I've studied, I'm an attorney.
[2:16:57.880 --> 2:17:02.880]  I've studied the classics in politics and government and college and it just, to me,
[2:17:02.880 --> 2:17:05.040]  it makes, you're the first person.
[2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:08.280]  I can't say I agree with you on everything yet because I have not, oh, I've listened
[2:17:08.280 --> 2:17:13.560]  to you for two weeks, but there's been nothing, or not nothing, but there's been, I'm not
[2:17:13.560 --> 2:17:17.240]  a lot of what they've been putting out there that makes a whole lot of sense.
[2:17:17.240 --> 2:17:21.200]  And listening to you as a new listener, I've been listening to what my family can attest
[2:17:21.200 --> 2:17:26.200]  to voraciously for the past couple of weeks because I guess, while I don't, I'm giving
[2:17:26.200 --> 2:17:32.200]  it for instance, 9-11, I can't say that, I mean, I think I'm scared to look at the literature
[2:17:32.200 --> 2:17:37.200]  because I have not, I would have a hard time believing that it's a hoax, even if confronted
[2:17:37.200 --> 2:17:38.200]  with the truth.
[2:17:38.200 --> 2:17:43.360]  Sir, all we ask you to do is to start questioning everything you're told and start looking into
[2:17:43.360 --> 2:17:48.960]  things for yourself, look, the Republican and Democratic parties have some good people
[2:17:48.960 --> 2:17:53.840]  in both parties, but the leadership give you two different brands, two different roads
[2:17:53.840 --> 2:18:01.360]  that lead the same place, consolidation of power, collectivism, Bush, quadruple's government,
[2:18:01.360 --> 2:18:03.880]  Obama is even worse than that.
[2:18:03.880 --> 2:18:08.320]  So the Republicans are driving at 10 miles an hour towards the cliff and Obama's driving
[2:18:08.320 --> 2:18:11.960]  at 20 miles an hour on some issues.
[2:18:11.960 --> 2:18:16.960]  On some issues, the Republicans are driving faster over the cliff than the Democrats.
[2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:21.640]  And any big government is going to be taken over by private corporate criminal interests
[2:18:21.640 --> 2:18:24.760]  and is going to be used to rape you.
[2:18:24.760 --> 2:18:29.160]  And so we've got to shrink government, we're bankrupt any way you cut it, and it's been
[2:18:29.160 --> 2:18:32.320]  done by design, but even if you don't believe it's been done by design, if you don't read
[2:18:32.320 --> 2:18:38.000]  their own literature, still it's too big, it's out of control, it's like, I'm not against
[2:18:38.000 --> 2:18:43.360]  illegal aliens, they're just good hardworking people, but we can't have billions of third
[2:18:43.360 --> 2:18:48.240]  worlders coming here with a socialist system because it will bankrupt everything.
[2:18:48.240 --> 2:18:52.400]  So I'm not against the illegals, but I'm against how they're being used to drive down wages
[2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:54.600]  and bring in a new world order.
[2:18:54.600 --> 2:18:58.760]  But see the left just says no, all illegals are great, and the right, you know, comes
[2:18:58.760 --> 2:19:02.960]  out and kind of whitewashes that.
[2:19:02.960 --> 2:19:06.360]  It's all controlled, sir, and I hope that answers your question.
[2:19:06.360 --> 2:19:09.520]  I mean, the world is sophisticated.
[2:19:09.520 --> 2:19:13.080]  And if there's any message, that's the message I'm trying to get out to people.
[2:19:13.080 --> 2:19:18.600]  Well, you have gotten that message out to me and I want to say that while I've been
[2:19:18.600 --> 2:19:22.240]  unable to, I've been satisfied, I've been listening to you, I'm going to continue to
[2:19:22.240 --> 2:19:24.720]  listen to you because I'm getting answers.
[2:19:24.720 --> 2:19:28.520]  Do I believe the whole climate gate, absolutely, you're spot on on that.
[2:19:28.520 --> 2:19:32.120]  And to stop my opinion, I mean, that they admit the emails are real and it's the head
[2:19:32.120 --> 2:19:36.840]  climatology organization and they've been caught red-handed, I mean, it's like Ronald
[2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:38.880]  Reagan said, trust but verify.
[2:19:38.880 --> 2:19:45.520]  Sir, if you look at 9-Eleven, it's admitted that the hijackers were given high-level security
[2:19:45.520 --> 2:19:48.320]  clearances and trained at bases.
[2:19:48.320 --> 2:19:52.000]  Six of the 10 commissioners say the whole thing was a whitewash and a coverup.
[2:19:52.000 --> 2:19:53.000]  Game over.
[2:19:53.000 --> 2:19:54.440]  9-Eleven is a fraud.
[2:19:54.440 --> 2:19:58.760]  We can debate exactly what happened there, but we know the official story is a giant
[2:19:58.760 --> 2:19:59.760]  fraud.
[2:19:59.760 --> 2:20:02.080]  We'll be back with more calls.

[2:21:01.560 --> 2:21:03.800]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?

[2:21:04.800 --> 2:21:08.360]  Yeah, don't you know Google, Yahoo and other search engines record all your searches and
[2:21:08.360 --> 2:21:09.920]  store them in a giant database?
[2:21:09.920 --> 2:21:11.720]  You should use StartPage instead.
[2:21:11.720 --> 2:21:12.720]  StartPage?
[2:21:12.720 --> 2:21:16.760]  Yeah, StartPage.com, the new name for Xquik, the world's most private search engine.
[2:21:16.760 --> 2:21:20.560]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.

[2:21:31.440 --> 2:21:33.560]  Hello, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[2:21:33.560 --> 2:21:37.480]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[2:21:37.480 --> 2:21:41.120]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[2:22:01.320 --> 2:22:05.520]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth
[2:22:05.520 --> 2:22:07.920]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[2:22:07.920 --> 2:22:13.080]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many
[2:22:13.080 --> 2:22:16.080]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[2:22:16.080 --> 2:22:19.720]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[2:22:19.720 --> 2:22:24.320]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[2:22:24.320 --> 2:22:28.080]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[2:22:28.080 --> 2:22:29.320]  from Jekyll Island.
[2:22:29.320 --> 2:22:33.480]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[2:22:33.480 --> 2:22:38.440]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[2:22:38.440 --> 2:22:39.880]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[2:23:00.840 --> 2:23:04.800]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Cola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator
[2:23:04.800 --> 2:23:07.760]  that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.

[2:24:07.800 --> 2:24:17.800]  Some folks are born silver spoon in their hand.
[2:24:17.800 --> 2:24:41.800]  The Cola Blue 28 is easy to use, but the Cola Blue 28 is easy to use, and the Cola Blue
[2:24:41.800 --> 2:25:08.740]  28 is easy to use and
[2:25:11.800 --> 2:25:21.440]  All right, I'm going to take some more calls and I'm doing a big news blitz when we start
[2:25:21.440 --> 2:25:22.440]  the next segment.
[2:25:22.440 --> 2:25:27.560]  I'm going to continue with your calls throughout the broadcast.
[2:25:27.560 --> 2:25:31.240]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[2:25:31.240 --> 2:25:32.400]  Mike, you're on the air.
[2:25:32.400 --> 2:25:33.400]  Go ahead.
[2:25:33.400 --> 2:25:41.200]  Two things, Alex, a message to the truth movement and a question on Lindsay Williams.
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:45.200]  The spirit of John the Baptist is alive and well, man.
[2:25:45.200 --> 2:25:49.040]  The voice of many crying in the wilderness.
[2:25:49.040 --> 2:25:53.160]  The tip of the spear has borne many children and one of those children as we are changed
[2:25:53.160 --> 2:25:55.960]  and look what they are doing, man.
[2:25:55.960 --> 2:25:57.760]  That was very intense.
[2:25:57.760 --> 2:26:01.640]  Oh, the power, the power of truth, the righteousness.
[2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:07.000]  It's really, I mean, that really buoyed me watching that video.
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:12.560]  It's because of us that this swine flu scam has taken a flop over dead.
[2:26:12.560 --> 2:26:14.280]  And they admit that in mainstream media.
[2:26:14.280 --> 2:26:16.040]  They say the public isn't buying it.
[2:26:16.040 --> 2:26:17.040]  Doctors aren't buying it.
[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:19.760]  We're having victory, victory, victory, victory.
[2:26:19.760 --> 2:26:22.560]  We can be reprieved like Nineveh.
[2:26:22.560 --> 2:26:23.560]  That's right.
[2:26:23.560 --> 2:26:27.760]  It's hard for some of us to see the forest for the trees, but it seems like everywhere
[2:26:27.760 --> 2:26:31.360]  we go, people are privy to what's going on.
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:35.960]  There have been many battles in history where one group outnumbered the other group two,
[2:26:35.960 --> 2:26:38.640]  three, four, five, even 10 to one.
[2:26:38.640 --> 2:26:43.800]  But because one group understood the art of war and to never give up and have the spirit,
[2:26:43.800 --> 2:26:48.400]  they would beat the larger group because the larger group would feel like they were losing.
[2:26:48.400 --> 2:26:53.960]  So much of this is psychological arrest, Al Gore, and give we are changed and about peace
[2:26:53.960 --> 2:26:54.960]  prize.
[2:26:54.960 --> 2:26:55.960]  Absolutely.
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:56.960]  Absolutely.
[2:26:56.960 --> 2:27:06.600]  Lindsay Williams, uh, the reason he gave for the drop of the price of oil per barrel was
[2:27:06.600 --> 2:27:12.000]  that to bankrupt Dubai, he said that a year ago on this show and it happened.
[2:27:12.000 --> 2:27:18.240]  I mean, look, I know the CEO he's talking to as a retired CEO of one of the big five
[2:27:18.240 --> 2:27:23.640]  at the time and everything he gets is directly from the new world order.
[2:27:23.640 --> 2:27:24.920]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:27:24.920 --> 2:27:25.920]  Thank you so much.
[2:27:25.920 --> 2:27:26.920]  That's a powerful info.
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:29.120]  Look, Lindsay didn't play in games.
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:31.280]  I know the names.
[2:27:31.280 --> 2:27:36.120]  He didn't volunteer them because that was his source, but he said, yeah, you're, you're
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:37.120]  right.
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:43.400]  Um, because see, he did say the name over 10 years ago in an interview when it wasn't
[2:27:43.400 --> 2:27:45.640]  a secret.
[2:27:45.640 --> 2:27:46.920]  So I have a memory.
[2:27:46.920 --> 2:27:49.360]  So I know who it is.
[2:27:49.360 --> 2:27:54.800]  Let's go ahead and take another call here, Mike in California or California.
[2:27:54.800 --> 2:27:58.520]  As the usurper calls it, go ahead, Mike.
[2:27:58.520 --> 2:28:00.880]  Mike just dropped Bonnie in New York, Bonnie.
[2:28:00.880 --> 2:28:01.880]  Come ahead.
[2:28:01.880 --> 2:28:02.880]  There.
[2:28:02.880 --> 2:28:03.880]  Hello.
[2:28:03.880 --> 2:28:04.880]  Hello.
[2:28:04.880 --> 2:28:05.880]  Hello.
[2:28:05.880 --> 2:28:06.880]  How are you?
[2:28:06.880 --> 2:28:07.880]  Good, Bonnie.
[2:28:07.880 --> 2:28:08.880]  Are you taking care of that cold?
[2:28:08.880 --> 2:28:09.880]  I don't have it anymore.
[2:28:09.880 --> 2:28:10.880]  I drank some colloidal silver.
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:11.880]  Right here, baby.
[2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:12.880]  I've been drinking this.
[2:28:12.880 --> 2:28:13.880]  I sent you some healing energy.
[2:28:13.880 --> 2:28:14.880]  Did you do it?
[2:28:14.880 --> 2:28:15.880]  Thank you.
[2:28:15.880 --> 2:28:16.880]  Feel it.
[2:28:16.880 --> 2:28:17.880]  Good.
[2:28:17.880 --> 2:28:18.880]  Good.
[2:28:18.880 --> 2:28:32.880]  This is going to be our prescription for fighting the tyranny, collective mindset, third eye.
[2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:33.880]  Okay.
[2:28:33.880 --> 2:28:36.000]  We're, we're fighting a spiritual war.
[2:28:36.000 --> 2:28:38.640]  It's a wavelength war.
[2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:47.280]  Everybody's got to go inside and focus totally on the truth, but then you've got to manifest
[2:28:47.280 --> 2:28:49.280]  that on the street.
[2:28:49.280 --> 2:28:51.480]  How are we going to do that?
[2:28:51.480 --> 2:28:55.680]  Little steps, little steps, it just, that's how big steps start.
[2:28:55.680 --> 2:28:58.320]  You know how we do it, Alex?
[2:28:58.320 --> 2:29:03.360]  The other day, my husband's a physician and he's been taking care of people for almost
[2:29:03.360 --> 2:29:06.840]  50 years and he's a legend in our town.
[2:29:06.840 --> 2:29:13.240]  He's a great healer, interestingly enough, parent, grandparents on all sides and father
[2:29:13.240 --> 2:29:17.200]  was a mason, but he declined.
[2:29:17.200 --> 2:29:21.640]  He became a free man, not a free mason.
[2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:25.520]  And he's been in the business of healing people and just the other day he was on call
[2:29:25.520 --> 2:29:26.520]  over the weekend.
[2:29:26.520 --> 2:29:32.600]  He's 81 years old and he's given away more free care in our country, in my city, my town,
[2:29:32.600 --> 2:29:34.320]  than any other doctor we know.
[2:29:34.320 --> 2:29:37.440]  Anyways, I didn't call to talk about him, but...
[2:29:37.440 --> 2:29:38.440]  Well, stay there.
[2:29:38.440 --> 2:29:42.400]  I'm going to come back to you real fast, Bonnie, and then we'll take a few more calls and
[2:29:42.400 --> 2:29:43.400]  I'm going to go over this news.
[2:29:43.400 --> 2:29:47.160]  A lot of news I haven't gotten to, but I wanted to take calls in the first half of the show
[2:29:47.160 --> 2:29:48.160]  and here we go.
[2:29:48.160 --> 2:29:49.160]  We'll be right back.
[2:29:49.160 --> 2:29:50.160]  Stay there.
[2:29:50.160 --> 2:30:02.160]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:02.160 --> 2:30:03.160]  Hello, folks.

[2:31:01.120 --> 2:31:05.200]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate
[2:31:05.200 --> 2:31:08.840]  and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.
[2:31:08.840 --> 2:31:14.760]  You can buy it at Here'sWhatYouDo.net as an e-book for 6 bucks or the book for 10 bucks
[2:31:14.760 --> 2:31:17.760]  and we have an audio book on its way for you commuters as well.
[2:31:17.760 --> 2:31:22.880]  Here's What You Do tells you exactly what to do to survive and thrive in these harsh
[2:31:22.880 --> 2:31:24.200]  economic times.
[2:31:24.200 --> 2:31:28.280]  This book will work for anyone, rich, poor, middle class, it doesn't matter.
[2:31:28.280 --> 2:31:32.320]  This book truly has the information that can make you wealthy and it will tell you how
[2:31:32.320 --> 2:31:33.840]  to protect your wealth as well.
[2:31:33.840 --> 2:31:35.960]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:37.680]  You need to look out for yourself.
[2:31:37.680 --> 2:31:40.200]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[2:31:40.200 --> 2:31:44.040]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your
[2:31:44.040 --> 2:31:45.040]  loved ones.
[2:31:45.040 --> 2:31:48.480]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[2:31:48.480 --> 2:31:51.840]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[2:31:51.840 --> 2:31:53.680]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[2:31:53.680 --> 2:32:02.320]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[2:32:02.320 --> 2:32:06.040]  Thousands of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[2:32:06.040 --> 2:32:09.200]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[2:32:09.200 --> 2:32:13.520]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[2:32:13.520 --> 2:32:14.520]  at home.
[2:32:14.520 --> 2:32:19.680]  We have tremendous influence on our president and Congress and they really are calling the
[2:32:19.680 --> 2:32:20.680]  shots.
[2:32:20.680 --> 2:32:25.520]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[2:32:25.520 --> 2:32:31.000]  For all of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[2:32:31.000 --> 2:32:35.640]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[2:32:35.640 --> 2:32:40.040]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and their arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress
[2:32:40.040 --> 2:32:42.000]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[2:32:42.000 --> 2:32:48.040]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[2:32:48.040 --> 2:32:49.040]  of the republic.
[2:32:49.040 --> 2:32:55.480]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right
[2:32:55.480 --> 2:33:13.240]  now at superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[2:33:13.240 --> 2:33:25.400]  I wish your buck was still silver, it was back when the country was wrong.
[2:33:25.400 --> 2:33:37.720]  Back before else and before the Vietnam War came along.
[2:33:37.720 --> 2:33:52.240]  Before the Beatles and yesterday, when a man could still work and still would, it was the
[2:33:52.240 --> 2:34:05.720]  last of the free life behind us now and our good times really over for good.
[2:34:05.720 --> 2:34:20.280]  And I was rollin' downhill like a snowball headed for hell with no kind of chance for
[2:34:20.280 --> 2:34:28.280]  the flag of the Liberty Bell.
[2:34:28.280 --> 2:34:39.840]  I wish you Ford and a Chevy were still last ten years like the shoot.
[2:34:39.840 --> 2:34:45.360]  It's the best of the free life behind us now.
[2:34:45.360 --> 2:34:49.960]  That's Merle Haggard.
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:54.040]  Think of what globalization has done to this country.
[2:34:54.040 --> 2:35:01.600]  Think about what all the New World Order's activities have produced and ask yourself,
[2:35:01.600 --> 2:35:05.960]  do we want even more of this ten times but we've already enjoyed?
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:11.080]  No, I've enjoyed as much of this as I can stand.
[2:35:11.080 --> 2:35:15.120]  And I'm a free man, I'm not a slave to these offshore banks and all their fraud and all
[2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:17.400]  their criminality and I'm standing up against them.
[2:35:17.400 --> 2:35:23.000]  Okay, real fast, Bonnie in New York, finish up the point you were makin'.
[2:35:23.000 --> 2:35:31.400]  Well, the point I want to make ultimately, Alex, and it wasn't about my wonderful husband
[2:35:31.400 --> 2:35:38.040]  who was my hero, but the point of the matter is there are good guys out there.
[2:35:38.040 --> 2:35:44.960]  I've seen your website, I've been posting, I know all about how the media is using people
[2:35:44.960 --> 2:35:50.360]  for their agenda and they've manipulated events for their agenda.
[2:35:50.360 --> 2:35:55.640]  And we see the evil in the world, but there's good out there, okay, good people.
[2:35:55.640 --> 2:36:01.880]  And right now what's going on is there's a liberation, okay, from the mental and emotional
[2:36:01.880 --> 2:36:03.240]  influences of the past.
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:08.880]  There's a spiritual struggle going on to overcome past materialistic tendencies.
[2:36:08.880 --> 2:36:12.800]  Right now I mean humanity's being called to raise itself to a higher level and the spiritual
[2:36:12.800 --> 2:36:18.880]  warriors of the future are going to be the ones who raise the frequency of the collective
[2:36:18.880 --> 2:36:27.040]  mindset from that materialistic, okay, vein of thinking to a spiritual vein of thinking.
[2:36:27.040 --> 2:36:36.840]  All right, all right, listen, I appreciate your call, listen, that's a complex issue
[2:36:36.840 --> 2:36:42.480]  because as Gilbert Griffin states correctly, we need to have a long view of history and
[2:36:42.480 --> 2:36:48.200]  we need to get in positions of power ourselves, constitutional positions, and as individual
[2:36:48.200 --> 2:36:54.640]  citizens we have that power as sovereigns to say no to these usurpations, the usurpers,
[2:36:54.640 --> 2:36:59.480]  the conquerors, the illegitimate pirates taking over our society.
[2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:04.680]  But I agree with you about the hierarchy of needs.
[2:37:04.680 --> 2:37:08.080]  You own stuff, stuff doesn't own you.
[2:37:08.080 --> 2:37:14.000]  You don't cheat or steal or hurt people for stuff.
[2:37:14.000 --> 2:37:17.320]  That's why my car gets keyed really bad.
[2:37:17.320 --> 2:37:19.960]  I'm like, so what?
[2:37:19.960 --> 2:37:25.600]  Or somebody backs into it in a parking lot, I'm like, I might fix that in a year.
[2:37:25.600 --> 2:37:32.160]  I like having a car that starts that has a good safety cage that won't break down on
[2:37:32.160 --> 2:37:37.920]  the side of the road, but my wife's not materialistic, but you know, she'll say, why don't you clean
[2:37:37.920 --> 2:37:42.560]  all the bird crap off your car, but you haven't cleaned that car in a year.
[2:37:42.560 --> 2:37:48.400]  So I almost go to the far extreme of not caring about things, things to me or tools.
[2:37:48.400 --> 2:37:52.000]  But there's also, and I'm not saying you're doing this, but for other people in the same
[2:37:52.000 --> 2:37:57.040]  vein of what you're discussing, kind of an extreme new age idea and India, it's nothing
[2:37:57.040 --> 2:38:01.080]  new about it has that idea where some of these yogis sit there under a tree homeless because
[2:38:01.080 --> 2:38:08.200]  they're in bliss, they're in Nirvana, they're in Valhalla, they're in heaven mentally, spiritually.
[2:38:08.200 --> 2:38:14.000]  And so why should they get up or get involved or help anybody because they can mentally
[2:38:14.000 --> 2:38:16.320]  transfer themselves somewhere.
[2:38:16.320 --> 2:38:22.600]  So too much of an extreme of that mindset gives you a Calcutta, a living hell.
[2:38:22.600 --> 2:38:30.520]  Take Mexico incredibly smart, hardworking, neat, inventive people, but there's an attitude
[2:38:30.520 --> 2:38:33.640]  to so what, I'll just be lazy because the whole system's corrupt.
[2:38:33.640 --> 2:38:34.640]  Somebody will just take it from me.
[2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:35.640]  I'll do it.
[2:38:35.640 --> 2:38:36.640]  Manana.
[2:38:36.640 --> 2:38:49.040]  I'll take a siesta to where Mexico can't ever seem to get anything done.
[2:38:49.040 --> 2:38:55.160]  And they let the corrupt elite run their system.
[2:38:55.160 --> 2:38:59.440]  But I do understand what you're talking about, about changing our mindsets to go out and
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:01.240]  have courage and stand up against corruption.
[2:39:01.240 --> 2:39:05.880]  But I think just magically changing your mindset, the proof of the mindset, the proof
[2:39:05.880 --> 2:39:09.080]  of the change is the action you then take.
[2:39:09.080 --> 2:39:14.040]  As Gandhi said, be the change you want to see in the world.
[2:39:14.040 --> 2:39:17.440]  India was easy to take over because people had to lay down and take that attitude.
[2:39:17.440 --> 2:39:19.920]  As soon as they quit having that attitude, it was over.
[2:39:19.920 --> 2:39:23.240]  As soon as they stopped drinking the Kool-Aid.
[2:39:23.240 --> 2:39:31.560]  Now I want to shift gears now and cover the news.
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:34.840]  And then we have a bunch of video and audio clips and other news I'm going to be covering
[2:39:34.840 --> 2:39:35.840]  the next hour.
[2:39:35.840 --> 2:39:43.280]  We'll continue with your phone calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:48.760]  But before I go any further, before this show runs out in an hour and 20 minutes from now,
[2:39:48.760 --> 2:39:52.360]  I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[2:39:52.360 --> 2:39:59.200]  You know, speaking of materialism, it's making materialism your God that's bad.
[2:39:59.200 --> 2:40:04.980]  It's having a fancy car and a new big screen TV, but your children are drinking tap water
[2:40:04.980 --> 2:40:09.640]  filled with hundreds of deadly chemicals put in the water to hurt their fertility and to
[2:40:09.640 --> 2:40:15.320]  brain damage them and give them leukemia and to give them diabetes and to give them
[2:40:15.320 --> 2:40:17.760]  bone cancer.
[2:40:17.760 --> 2:40:22.040]  What John P. Holdren calls for, drugging the water supply to sterilize you.
[2:40:22.040 --> 2:40:27.560]  They're doing it, but people's priority is to go to the football game and get drunk.
[2:40:27.560 --> 2:40:33.720]  Their priority is to go spend $100 a night at the bar buying their buddy's drinks instead
[2:40:33.720 --> 2:40:39.560]  of supporting this radio show instead of supporting Ron Paul, instead of supporting themselves
[2:40:39.560 --> 2:40:43.560]  or giving their children true organic food.
[2:40:43.560 --> 2:40:47.520]  It's priorities.
[2:40:47.520 --> 2:40:52.280]  The materialism of all the firearms I own isn't, oh, I go pet them and oh, I have all
[2:40:52.280 --> 2:40:53.280]  these guns.
[2:40:53.280 --> 2:40:57.680]  It's that it's the right of a free man to be armed and I own guns.
[2:40:57.680 --> 2:41:02.160]  When I buy gold or silver and make quadruple profits because I knew what was coming because
[2:41:02.160 --> 2:41:03.720]  I could read the globalist own documents.
[2:41:03.720 --> 2:41:09.680]  It wasn't so I could go to a safety deposit box and open a little drawer of gold and sit
[2:41:09.680 --> 2:41:13.960]  there and go gold and play with it with my hands.
[2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:19.440]  So I've got an emergency backup for my family in this operation, but I'm going off into
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:21.080]  a rant about this.
[2:41:21.080 --> 2:41:26.240]  The point is these sponsors are important and people need to support them because raising
[2:41:26.240 --> 2:41:30.640]  your consciousness level isn't going to do jack squat about deadly fluoride in your body.
[2:41:30.640 --> 2:41:33.840]  But I do agree with much of what you're saying, ma'am.
[2:41:33.840 --> 2:41:39.920]  Akola blue.com, did you know you could be drinking fresh, clean water made right from
[2:41:39.920 --> 2:41:43.440]  the air you breathe and know this isn't something out of a science fiction book.
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:47.680]  Our sponsor, Akola blue with the Akola blue 28 machine will allow you to do just that.
[2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:52.080]  It's easy to use and it will make it to 7.5 gallons a day of water.
[2:41:52.080 --> 2:41:55.560]  The water once generated passes through a seven stage filtering process, including reverse
[2:41:55.560 --> 2:42:00.200]  osmosis carbon filtration techniques, ensuring that you know exactly what you were drinking.
[2:42:00.200 --> 2:42:02.240]  No chemicals, pollutants or fluoride.
[2:42:02.240 --> 2:42:06.040]  We spend so much time talking about on the show, get your very own source of unlimited
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:10.560]  renewable drinking water for you and your families today by visiting them on the website, Akola
[2:42:10.560 --> 2:42:11.880]  blue.com.
[2:42:11.880 --> 2:42:16.840]  It's E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com or by clicking on their banner on info wars dot com or prison
[2:42:16.840 --> 2:42:20.920]  planet dot com or give them a call at eight hundred six nine one sixty forty three eight
[2:42:20.920 --> 2:42:23.880]  hundred six nine one sixty forty three.
[2:42:23.880 --> 2:42:30.560]  One other sponsor I want to tell you about is the foods direct dot com.
[2:42:30.560 --> 2:42:36.040]  We don't have to remind you that you need food to survive and he foods direct is the
[2:42:36.040 --> 2:42:39.040]  longest continually operating storeable foods company in the country.
[2:42:39.040 --> 2:42:42.760]  They have 10% off for the rest of the month on their already low low prices of non-gmo
[2:42:42.760 --> 2:42:43.760]  non-hybrid food.
[2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:47.560]  They also have to be true patriots and have supported the freedom movement for years and
[2:42:47.560 --> 2:42:52.760]  years man more than 20 years I know of the looming globalist operations, the swine flu,
[2:42:52.760 --> 2:42:57.680]  the talk of wars, depression, the police state, all of this it's imperative that you make
[2:42:57.680 --> 2:43:01.560]  sure you and your family are prepared with non-gmo good clean storeable foods.

[2:43:16.640 --> 2:43:30.960]  three efoodsdirect.com okay let's go over the news now and when I preface a story like
[2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:37.920]  this I don't preface it because I'm scared of the truth I don't preface it because I'm
[2:43:37.920 --> 2:43:46.280]  trying to win a popularity contest I preface it because it's so subtle and so nuanced and
[2:43:46.280 --> 2:43:56.120]  so multifaceted and multivariate that if I come out and report this wrong it will drive
[2:43:56.120 --> 2:44:06.800]  people further apart and will aid the globalists that want to engage and divide and conquer
[2:44:06.800 --> 2:44:12.240]  but at the same time it needs to be discussed because there's a media cover up concerning
[2:44:12.240 --> 2:44:18.160]  this predominantly.
[2:44:18.160 --> 2:44:26.080]  We report on how the mainline Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist organizations are controlled
[2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:29.840]  by the federal government ADL southern primary law center and others they've been caught
[2:44:29.840 --> 2:44:37.320]  over and over again not just infiltrating the groups but captaining them running them
[2:44:37.320 --> 2:44:43.080]  and I've had all the chief Nazi websites with millions of viewers a month I always attack
[2:44:43.080 --> 2:44:51.840]  Alex Jones and why do they do that they do that because I have a spirit of victory I
[2:44:51.840 --> 2:44:58.240]  understand we can win I spread that spirit of victory infectiously because I know the
[2:44:58.240 --> 2:45:04.240]  power of the people in history and I understand that we can't be divided we have to be united
[2:45:04.240 --> 2:45:09.120]  on the bill of rights constitution declaration of independence against the new world order
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:25.000]  and when we make it racial or religious then that allows the globalist to
[2:45:25.000 --> 2:45:30.080]  divide us and control us under the constitution under the bill of rights the minority view
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:35.760]  the minority organization is as protected as the majority because in a pure democracy
[2:45:35.760 --> 2:45:46.680]  51% can vote to kill or enslave or scalp or whatever they want the other 49 and the big
[2:45:46.680 --> 2:45:53.480]  money banks offshore use the howling mob to be sicked on the middle class which is the
[2:45:53.480 --> 2:45:58.200]  hereditary enemy of the elite because the middle class is educated informed healthy
[2:45:58.200 --> 2:46:05.280]  dynamic upwardly mobile that's a major wild card but I'm promising what I'm going with
[2:46:05.280 --> 2:46:09.320]  here because I want to try to give you a bigger picture as I see it you can have your own
[2:46:09.320 --> 2:46:16.760]  view and I knew over the years and it came out that white supremacist groups in Florida
[2:46:16.760 --> 2:46:20.440]  that always attacked myself as their number one enemy they spend more time attacking
[2:46:20.440 --> 2:46:26.040]  Alex Jones and they spend attacking Israel they claim they hate so much and then it came
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:34.960]  out in the what's the big paper in came out a bunch of the papers but it came out in the
[2:46:34.960 --> 2:46:43.200]  Orlando Sentinel last year headline leader of white supremacist organization FBI informant
[2:46:43.200 --> 2:46:48.160]  and how they ran it most the people in the group were feds I've been the protest of the
[2:46:48.160 --> 2:46:53.880]  Klan I've been the protest of the Aryan nations and you can look at them their cops you can
[2:46:53.880 --> 2:47:00.040]  look at them and if anybody was ever the art type old you know you know genetic look of
[2:47:00.040 --> 2:47:03.960]  a Jewish guy well I mean here in Austin they had him here and it was it was the three guys
[2:47:03.960 --> 2:47:09.000]  up on stage were Jewish I mean like Howard Stern I mean this was a sickening joke and
[2:47:09.000 --> 2:47:13.880]  I've always pointed that out and that makes the establishment very very mad Hal Turner
[2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:21.160]  always putting out fake Amaro stories always putting out fake news always attacking me
[2:47:21.160 --> 2:47:27.120]  I told you six seven years ago that guy was a fed and I only come out and say things like
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:33.480]  that when I'm sure I listen to him I knew he was a fed calling for killing judges and
[2:47:33.480 --> 2:47:41.200]  calling for doing all this I mean if he knew he was a fed creating list of people now this
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:48.240]  has come out in the Boston Globe a few months ago but here it is report FBI paid blogger
[2:47:48.240 --> 2:47:54.280]  and that is the headline give me a shot for prison planet dot TV viewers this is out of
[2:47:54.280 --> 2:48:08.040]  Trenton New Jersey Chicago Tribune also broadcast on WGN radio and WGN 9 TV report FBI paid blogger
[2:48:08.040 --> 2:48:18.320]  and it turns out he is an agent like he said he was now there are groups of poor disgruntled
[2:48:18.320 --> 2:48:27.680]  white people who go out and who beat up black men or beat up Hispanics and those cases do
[2:48:27.680 --> 2:48:34.960]  happen but very rarely that said there is another group openly run by the feds that
[2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:42.680]  I must expose because I'm about the truth I'm about integrity I'm gonna get the black
[2:48:42.680 --> 2:48:49.320]  folks in a minute but Metia and Lorazza Lorazza means the race and their motto is for those
[2:48:49.320 --> 2:48:53.880]  in the race everything for those outside the race nothing that's literally a Hitler translation
[2:48:53.880 --> 2:48:59.440]  for the German people everything for those outside the German Aryan race nothing I mean
[2:48:59.440 --> 2:49:05.440]  this is sick there but they're not just funded by the FBI they're funded by Miller Brewing
[2:49:05.440 --> 2:49:11.920]  they're funded by Anheuser Bush they're funded by AT&T they're funded by I mean go go to their
[2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:18.920]  website hundreds of corporate sponsors they've got comedians they put on national television
[2:49:18.920 --> 2:49:26.360]  constantly invoking race what is behind this divide and conquer so I'm gonna briefly explain
[2:49:26.360 --> 2:49:35.280]  that when we come back then I'm gonna get into police shootings there are black men
[2:49:35.280 --> 2:49:46.040]  all over the United States killing cops and attacking whites and Hispanics and this latest
[2:49:46.040 --> 2:49:52.480]  situation the suspect they have cornered there they believe went and shot these four cops
[2:49:52.480 --> 2:50:07.240]  he's a suspect but another person just pled guilty there's another report out of Oakland
[2:50:07.240 --> 2:50:14.200]  where the man's pled guilty to killing the four police officers and the media is not
[2:50:14.200 --> 2:50:20.600]  explaining they go out and target white officers and kill them and this is all racially driven
[2:50:20.600 --> 2:50:27.040]  and I want to break down where all of this is going if we don't stop it this is exactly
[2:50:27.040 --> 2:50:33.360]  what the new world order wants but clearly there are racial attacks by blacks on whites
[2:50:33.360 --> 2:50:42.680]  mainly police officers going on nationwide and I don't believe this is staged but we're
[2:50:42.680 --> 2:50:49.040]  gonna talk about that too because the truth is human beings are all basically the same
[2:50:49.040 --> 2:50:54.880]  people are people and it's this victim ideology in the Hispanics and the blacks in the whites
[2:50:54.880 --> 2:51:02.960]  that has us all killing each other and it needs to stop when you hear the words water

[2:52:12.520 --> 2:52:16.240]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home have turned a tremendous
[2:52:16.240 --> 2:52:21.640]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think
[2:52:21.640 --> 2:52:27.520]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the republic
[2:52:27.520 --> 2:52:34.160]  identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[2:52:34.160 --> 2:52:39.080]  and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're
[2:52:39.080 --> 2:52:43.200]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today
[2:52:43.200 --> 2:52:49.280]  it seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[2:52:49.280 --> 2:52:55.680]  republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at info wars dot com we're watching
[2:52:55.680 --> 2:53:02.360]  online right now in super high quality at prison planet dot tv this is alex jones with
[2:53:02.360 --> 2:53:07.320]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[2:53:07.320 --> 2:53:11.840]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies
[2:53:11.840 --> 2:53:17.000]  are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[2:53:17.000 --> 2:53:21.760]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[2:53:21.760 --> 2:53:26.640]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[2:53:26.640 --> 2:53:31.600]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[2:53:31.600 --> 2:53:35.840]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[2:53:35.840 --> 2:53:40.480]  weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:53:40.480 --> 2:53:44.400]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered
[2:53:44.400 --> 2:53:49.960]  by solutions from science one of my old sponsors you can get more information at w w w dot my
[2:53:49.960 --> 2:53:54.640]  solar backup dot com that's my solar backup dot com remember the government doesn't own
[2:53:54.640 --> 2:54:02.440]  the sun so go to my solar backup dot com or call 1-877-327-0365
[2:54:02.440 --> 2:54:21.440]  I read the news today oh boy about a lucky man who made the grade and though the news
[2:54:21.440 --> 2:54:40.920]  was rather sad well I just had to laugh I saw the photograph he blew his mind out in
[2:54:40.920 --> 2:54:55.280]  a car okay so people are asking what do white supremacists predominantly run by the government
[2:54:55.280 --> 2:55:01.560]  and other private organizations connected to government have to do with Mecha and La Raza
[2:55:01.560 --> 2:55:05.160]  which are thousands of times bigger than the white supremacist organizations that the media
[2:55:05.160 --> 2:55:10.960]  says are legitimate are allowed to be racially based are allowed to be racist what does that
[2:55:10.960 --> 2:55:17.240]  have to do with cop killers well the bottom line is they've got all these racial groups
[2:55:17.240 --> 2:55:23.840]  feeling sorry for themselves feeling victimized feeling like they have a right to do whatever
[2:55:23.840 --> 2:55:29.080]  they want and I read every few days in local papers from Texas to California from Indiana
[2:55:29.080 --> 2:55:38.000]  to New York where Hispanic MS-13 Mexican mafia others go and target blacks mainly and just
[2:55:38.000 --> 2:55:44.240]  kill black men on the street I mean every couple days I read about that but it's never
[2:55:44.240 --> 2:55:51.160]  called racial it's called gang no they're targeting black men and there's some targeting
[2:55:51.160 --> 2:55:56.080]  of whites and the media only hype stood up though when whites kill a black person or
[2:55:56.080 --> 2:56:00.160]  a Hispanic when you look at the statistics it's off the charts the other way around
[2:56:00.160 --> 2:56:04.520]  because these groups feel sorry for themselves and have been taught whitey is the reason
[2:56:04.520 --> 2:56:11.000]  this has happened when the globalist may be predominantly white but they're poison and
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:15.320]  everybody's water supply the Federal Reserve is taxing everybody out of existence and shutting
[2:56:15.320 --> 2:56:22.040]  down our factories and trying to force vaccines on all of us and we better stick together even
[2:56:22.040 --> 2:56:26.680]  if some of you want to kill each other later if you want to be ignorant that's that's your
[2:56:26.680 --> 2:56:32.280]  business but we might as well get together against the Federal Reserve now and then
[2:56:32.280 --> 2:56:36.640]  you can kill each other later if you're hell bent on that because the big threat is the
[2:56:36.640 --> 2:56:44.200]  scientific dictatorship it is the world government the people that created HIV AIDS you don't
[2:56:44.200 --> 2:56:48.720]  hear Jesse Jackson when he's out race pimping talking about that do you you don't hear him
[2:56:48.720 --> 2:56:57.200]  talking about Obama doubling the forced abortion money for China and Africa now without even
[2:56:57.200 --> 2:57:02.640]  looking this morning I googled police shooting and I found three articles about black men
[2:57:02.640 --> 2:57:09.920]  shooting or allegedly shooting police family accused family account of Oakland parolee
[2:57:09.920 --> 2:57:15.200]  who killed the four police officers he's pled guilty the Oakland parolee who took the lives
[2:57:15.200 --> 2:57:19.800]  of four Oakland police officers knew he was a wanted man and he literally skipped out
[2:57:19.800 --> 2:57:29.040]  on a meeting as part of a few he was having with his parole agent his family said today
[2:57:29.040 --> 2:57:40.680]  level mixing now that's Oakland I've got another one right here Denver police arrest 32 in
[2:57:40.680 --> 2:57:47.760]  series of downtown assaults they admit in this article this is the rarity that it was racially
[2:57:47.760 --> 2:57:53.360]  motivated the Denver police arrested 32 men and juvenile boys after a month's long undercover
[2:57:53.360 --> 2:57:57.760]  investigation to what police said were racially motivated assaults and robberies in downtown
[2:57:57.760 --> 2:58:02.640]  Denver including the low due entertainment district a task force composed of Denver police
[2:58:02.640 --> 2:58:06.720]  FBI and Denver district attorney's office investigated 26 incidents that's tip of the
[2:58:06.720 --> 2:58:11.520]  iceberg in which groups of black males verbally harass assaulted and at times robbed white
[2:58:11.520 --> 2:58:17.360]  or Latino males according to Denver police chief see that's because it's racially they
[2:58:17.360 --> 2:58:23.640]  think it's okay to do that because oh it's whites and Hispanics they've been taught through
[2:58:23.640 --> 2:58:28.720]  multiculturalism that claims it brings unity that there's all these differences that's
[2:58:28.720 --> 2:58:34.400]  how the globalist divide and conquer and I want to dovetail that when we come back with
[2:58:34.400 --> 2:58:44.280]  the latest shootings in Washington state the four dead cops stay with us thank you for

[2:59:54.440 --> 3:00:18.720]  raging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[3:00:18.720 --> 3:00:25.960]  so all over the nation hispanics are killing blacks predominantly blacks are killing whites
[3:00:25.960 --> 3:00:32.600]  and hispanics everybody's killing Asians Asians are killing Asians they mainly prey
[3:00:32.600 --> 3:00:37.720]  on each other statistically we have all these FBI justice department numbers it paints a
[3:00:37.720 --> 3:00:44.320]  really dangerous picture meanwhile the globalist are up there laughing because as this racial
[3:00:44.320 --> 3:00:51.920]  crime intensifies the establishment can run all these ads and government programs speaking
[3:00:51.920 --> 3:01:03.320]  out against it which only adds to the tension this is the defied and conquer program now
[3:01:03.320 --> 3:01:11.040]  I don't know if this is the case but he certainly fits the bill with the assessment but it turns
[3:01:11.040 --> 3:01:18.280]  out that a individual who was pardoned by huckabee in 2000 and who has been charged with rape
[3:01:18.280 --> 3:01:26.000]  and assault on a police officer recently is the person they believe he's the main suspect
[3:01:26.000 --> 3:01:31.680]  gunned down four police officers yesterday a government alleged to have shot dead four
[3:01:31.680 --> 3:01:36.120]  police officers was on the run Monday after a house at the center of a tent standoff in
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:42.200]  washington state was found to be empty police said after laying siege to the home in seattle's
[3:01:42.200 --> 3:01:46.280]  lechi neighborhood for 11 hours police swat teams entered the building were convicted
[3:01:46.280 --> 3:01:53.480]  felon morris clemons was believed to be holed up we have cleared the resident seattle police
[3:01:53.480 --> 3:02:04.080]  tactical went in and checked the residents the suspect was not there
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:08.880]  and it goes on a murder warrant has been issued while a reward leading to clemons arrest has
[3:02:08.880 --> 3:02:13.820]  been increased to $125,000 the police don't want to tell you they've got license plate
[3:02:13.820 --> 3:02:19.720]  reading cameras that's probably how they tracked him so fast if he didn't do it you need to
[3:02:19.720 --> 3:02:24.320]  let me know you're listening to me I understand you may need some medical help one negotiator
[3:02:24.320 --> 3:02:32.520]  said through a local media and it goes on it says he was released on bail last week
[3:02:32.520 --> 3:02:37.360]  after being held for several months on charges of assaulting a police officer and child rape
[3:02:37.360 --> 3:02:42.920]  now wire pot heads kept because they make good workers in the private prisons but the government
[3:02:42.920 --> 3:02:47.000]  has been caught in government documents before admitting they release violent offenders to
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:51.680]  go out and create carnage in the public low low level cops don't know this but the high
[3:02:51.680 --> 3:02:57.840]  level ones do so that the public begs for more police and what do you expect I mean
[3:02:57.840 --> 3:03:05.760]  huckabee let this guy go after all the horrible rap sheets and things he did earlier after
[3:03:05.760 --> 3:03:09.880]  his release clements committed two armed robberies in a string of other crimes which earned him
[3:03:09.880 --> 3:03:14.600]  another 10 year sentence court of the seattle times clements served only part of a 35 year
[3:03:14.600 --> 3:03:19.640]  sentence in Arkansas before it was commuted in 2000 when governor huckabee sought the
[3:03:19.640 --> 3:03:27.440]  republican presidential nomination and I've got here in the article with his previous
[3:03:27.440 --> 3:03:34.760]  convictions where I don't remember I I know it was really really bad we just pull that
[3:03:34.760 --> 3:03:40.440]  up for me so I don't want to get it wrong it was really bad I want to say it was murder
[3:03:40.440 --> 3:03:46.040]  and huckabee said because he did it when he was 17 he let him go the point is this guy
[3:03:46.040 --> 3:03:51.520]  it's released over and over and over and over again for violent offenses the jails we have
[3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:55.560]  more presence any other country in the world even China has a billion 300 million they
[3:03:55.560 --> 3:04:01.040]  have less presence than us I mean there are people for white collar offenses petty offenses
[3:04:01.040 --> 3:04:06.440]  cops beat people up and and on squad car video and then charge them with assault the person
[3:04:06.440 --> 3:04:13.760]  serves five years and all the fake charges you've put out police packs the presence
[3:04:13.760 --> 3:04:18.680]  full of nonviolent people so real killers are on the loose like this other guy that
[3:04:18.680 --> 3:04:27.440]  killed four cops had all these violent convictions and you let him go the courts let him go and
[3:04:27.440 --> 3:04:37.760]  then the answer by the media is oh see we need more presence see how they do that it's
[3:04:37.760 --> 3:04:44.720]  all psychology see it's okay when this guy's praying on raping kids and robbing people
[3:04:44.720 --> 3:04:52.600]  and shooting people but now he's killed four cops allegedly so if he gets caught and convicted
[3:04:52.600 --> 3:05:00.840]  they're gonna kill him with lethal injection you know 90% of cop killers get caught and
[3:05:00.840 --> 3:05:05.400]  only 10% people to kill us this is Alex Jones with some important questions if you're going

[3:08:21.520 --> 3:08:35.280]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us I am going to continue
[3:08:35.280 --> 3:08:45.720]  with some of the news here and then I'm going to get into your phone calls but first I wanted
[3:08:45.720 --> 3:08:51.720]  to play the first few minutes of my interview with Lord Moncton Friday this hour long interview
[3:08:51.720 --> 3:08:59.960]  is just dynamite with so much information and it's posted at youtube it's posted in
[3:08:59.960 --> 3:09:05.360]  higher quality at prismplanet.tv for members I'm asking everyone to go get the articles
[3:09:05.360 --> 3:09:12.840]  that Paul Watson has written and one of them titled Lord Moncton abolish the un arrest
[3:09:12.840 --> 3:09:17.600]  al gore and it breaks down all the key points is great to email friends and family and it
[3:09:17.600 --> 3:09:23.480]  has the hour long video slash radio interview I did Friday with Lord Moncton I know a lot
[3:09:23.480 --> 3:09:26.680]  of you were on vacation then a lot of you didn't tune in that day it was one of the
[3:09:26.680 --> 3:09:33.320]  best interviews I've ever done on the fake man made climate change on all of this and
[3:09:33.320 --> 3:09:38.280]  how important this fight in Copenhagen Denmark coming up in seven and a half days is that
[3:09:38.280 --> 3:09:41.880]  Obama is going to be attending where they're openly setting up world government are we
[3:09:41.880 --> 3:09:47.040]  ready with Lord Moncton let's go ahead and roll that here it is campaign last week when
[3:09:47.040 --> 3:09:53.080]  it came out those emails were real and I would imagine you were popping some champagne well
[3:09:53.080 --> 3:09:58.760]  we've been following the people named in these emails the year we thought they were linked
[3:09:58.760 --> 3:10:04.080]  and of course these emails established exactly how they were linked and it's very very interesting
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:09.000]  because we had suspected there were just about two dozen people who around the world mostly
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:14.120]  this side of the Atlantic and in America who were putting this global warming scam together
[3:10:14.120 --> 3:10:18.560]  and actually driving it rather than doing what the likes of al gore and the politicians
[3:10:18.560 --> 3:10:21.760]  who just drifting along with it because they don't know any better these are the people
[3:10:21.760 --> 3:10:26.600]  who have known all along that there isn't a problem and they've been bending the data
[3:10:26.600 --> 3:10:31.280]  and admitting to each other they've been bending the data for the sake of concealing the fact
[3:10:31.280 --> 3:10:37.440]  that their data are no good absolutely and and I mean this really proves a conspiracy
[3:10:37.440 --> 3:10:43.680]  here doesn't it you have called for the prosecution of the climate criminals you were the first
[3:10:43.680 --> 3:10:48.360]  now many other representatives from Australia to the United States are calling for criminal
[3:10:48.360 --> 3:10:53.440]  investigations there's going to have to be a criminal investigation by the information
[3:10:53.440 --> 3:10:58.480]  commissioner whose job is to make sure that publicly available information is available
[3:10:58.480 --> 3:11:03.840]  to the public and that officials like these creeps in the climate research center and
[3:11:03.840 --> 3:11:11.600]  their colleagues all over the United States as well were prevented from hiding destroying
[3:11:11.600 --> 3:11:17.720]  tampering with shuffling away the data which we paid for and it therefore belongs to us
[3:11:17.720 --> 3:11:23.040]  and they used a series of excuses they said well the data protection act they said the
[3:11:23.040 --> 3:11:28.480]  data belong to other countries weather bureaus hey this is weather data it's not a state
[3:11:28.480 --> 3:11:34.200]  secret they were trying to say that they weren't going to email each other they were saying
[3:11:34.200 --> 3:11:40.200]  we are not going to give this data to anybody they were even saying they wouldn't write
[3:11:40.200 --> 3:11:46.880]  any learning papers for journals which required as part of the peer review process that all
[3:11:46.880 --> 3:11:51.920]  the data and all the computer code and all the intermediate calculations should be shown
[3:11:51.920 --> 3:11:57.320]  and archived so that other scientists could check it they were determined that other scientists
[3:11:57.320 --> 3:12:02.720]  shouldn't be allowed to check their work because they knew that they were simply making things
[3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:09.440]  up these people are financial fraudsters they took at least twenty million dollars that
[3:12:09.440 --> 3:12:15.080]  we can trace in recent years in so-called grants for so-called scientific research and
[3:12:15.080 --> 3:12:20.800]  they did it on the basis of a financial and scientific fraud so they should not only be
[3:12:20.800 --> 3:12:24.640]  locked up for concealing and destroying data that have been requested under the freedom
[3:12:24.640 --> 3:12:29.840]  of information act by other scientists they should also be locked up for financial fraud
[3:12:29.840 --> 3:12:35.880]  and international racketeering well said sir we're going to come right back after this
[3:12:35.880 --> 3:12:40.600]  quick break with a long segment I would like to blow by blow get your detailed knowledge
[3:12:40.600 --> 3:12:46.640]  of this some of the history who these people are what their bigger goals are and then specifically
[3:12:46.640 --> 3:12:52.440]  right through climate gain all the different sectors of fraud that they have engaged in
[3:12:52.440 --> 3:12:58.000]  like covering up the four-year request persecuting scientists colluding to persecute people which
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:04.800]  is racketeering which is extortion fraud grant fraud and now their response saying so what
[3:13:04.800 --> 3:13:13.400]  well for the rest of the hour Lord Christopher Moncton third by count of Moncton and Wrenchley
[3:13:13.400 --> 3:13:19.200]  worked at the highest levels in the UK government at 10 down in street one of the chief advisors
[3:13:19.200 --> 3:13:24.880]  to then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher you can find out more about his bio by visiting
[3:13:24.880 --> 3:13:30.200]  his website we'll give that out again repeatedly before he leaves us but some stations just
[3:13:30.200 --> 3:13:35.080]  joined us recapping Lord Moncton tell us about yourself you've been talking about this for
[3:13:35.080 --> 3:13:42.520]  more than a decade and now what climate gate means the different sectors of fraud and how
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:48.200]  you believe from your perspective this should be prosecuted for those who haven't come
[3:13:48.200 --> 3:13:54.840]  across climate gate this was the release of a large number of emails between about two
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:14:03.400]  dozen malevolent crooked scientists right at the top of the climatological tree these
[3:14:03.400 --> 3:14:10.520]  are the people who between them have conspired to invent and then maintain the scare of global
[3:14:10.520 --> 3:14:18.760]  warming and the emails came from the University of East Anglia's climatic research centre
[3:14:18.760 --> 3:14:26.360]  which specializes in calculating the global temperature record for the whole world over
[3:14:26.360 --> 3:14:32.280]  the last 150 years since we first began having what one might call global instrumental coverage
[3:14:32.280 --> 3:14:37.560]  with thermometers all over the world and it's quite a complex process because very few of
[3:14:37.560 --> 3:14:41.760]  the temperature stations remain in the same place for any length of time they come in
[3:14:41.760 --> 3:14:46.320]  and out some work some stop working some don't report properly some don't report at all
[3:14:46.320 --> 3:14:52.320]  whole chunks of Russia disappeared in 1990 when the Berlin Wall came down so it's very
[3:14:52.320 --> 3:14:57.720]  difficult actually to make sense of all this data but unfortunately what they were doing
[3:14:57.720 --> 3:15:03.280]  at the climate research centre with active assistance from many other climate scientists
[3:15:03.280 --> 3:15:09.040]  around the world was they were simply making up the 20th century record of temperatures
[3:15:09.040 --> 3:15:14.600]  so we don't even know how much warmer it has got over the 20th century we know broadly
[3:15:14.600 --> 3:15:17.840]  speaking it's got warmer because it's been getting warmer for 300 years nothing to do
[3:15:17.840 --> 3:15:23.840]  with us but we didn't know how much and the whole idea of having this very elaborate international
[3:15:23.840 --> 3:15:28.520]  network of temperature stations with people going and looking in little boxes and making
[3:15:28.520 --> 3:15:32.160]  a note of the temperature every day and then phoning their local weather bureau and that
[3:15:32.160 --> 3:15:36.840]  then being passed on to just two or three places around the world of which East Anglia
[3:15:36.840 --> 3:15:40.840]  was one where they compiled these records this was an enormously elaborate piece of
[3:15:40.840 --> 3:15:45.400]  work and then when it got to East Anglia and the other and the two American universities
[3:15:45.400 --> 3:15:50.000]  where this was processed what they did then as we now know because we've seen their computer
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:54.440]  code and we've seen their data they didn't store the data properly they didn't keep it
[3:15:54.440 --> 3:15:58.800]  in an organised form that they didn't know by the end of it what their own computer
[3:15:58.800 --> 3:16:04.000]  programmers were doing but they were processing all of the data several times over and it had
[3:16:04.000 --> 3:16:10.480]  become a complete mess and essentially they were simply making up the temperature increases
[3:16:10.480 --> 3:16:15.960]  of the last 20 years it is simply a fiction it's science fiction.
[3:16:15.960 --> 3:16:20.640]  Well expanding on that and of course you obviously have read the emails they talk about temperatures
[3:16:20.640 --> 3:16:27.680]  are dropping how do we fix it how do we spin it how do we hide the decline and then of course
[3:16:27.680 --> 3:16:31.340]  there's the whole area of how they're talking about keeping people out of journals persecuting
[3:16:31.340 --> 3:16:37.480]  journals blocking for your request working with government officials to block this information
[3:16:37.480 --> 3:16:42.840]  from the public I mean this is racketeering it is racketeering I think I think it does
[3:16:42.840 --> 3:16:48.320]  it is nicely covered by your RICO statute and fun enough we have just put a new act
[3:16:48.320 --> 3:16:53.640]  on the on the statute book a few years ago called the fraud act and this is fraud on
[3:16:53.640 --> 3:16:57.880]  our side of the Atlantic and racketeering as you would call it on yours these are people
[3:16:57.880 --> 3:17:03.280]  who deserve to go to prison for a very long time and I'll tell you why I'm so angry about
[3:17:03.280 --> 3:17:08.120]  it because it's a point that nearly always forgotten in all the commentaries about climate
[3:17:08.120 --> 3:17:13.880]  change that global warming isn't killing anyone and it isn't going to kill anyone what is
[3:17:13.880 --> 3:17:20.840]  killing people and killing them by the million of starvation now is the effect of the global
[3:17:20.840 --> 3:17:27.720]  warming scare because many nations including the United States have taken up to a third
[3:17:27.720 --> 3:17:34.800]  of their agricultural land out from growing food for people who needed it to growing biofuels
[3:17:34.800 --> 3:17:40.440]  for clunkers that didn't and that has meant in the last year or two a doubling and I mean
[3:17:40.440 --> 3:17:45.320]  a doubling of world food prices and the world bank says that that nearly all of that doubling
[3:17:45.320 --> 3:17:51.080]  of world food prices is directly attributed to the biofuels scam which in turn is directly
[3:17:51.080 --> 3:17:56.760]  caused by the global warming scare and government saying well even if it isn't true we've got
[3:17:56.760 --> 3:18:01.720]  to take precautions but you have to remember you also have to take precautions to check
[3:18:01.720 --> 3:18:05.960]  that the precautions you're taking are not killing people by the million which is what
[3:18:05.960 --> 3:18:11.560]  this policy of biofuels is actually doing and by the way all of this scare comes out
[3:18:11.560 --> 3:18:16.880]  from these idiots and these crooks and these criminals and I am very sorry I'm not kind
[3:18:16.880 --> 3:18:24.680]  of keeping my normal calm self here so incandescent with fury that these people whom we as British
[3:18:24.680 --> 3:18:30.480]  taxpayers and you as American taxpayers have been paying to do this work and we have been
[3:18:30.480 --> 3:18:36.560]  trusting them to do it right they have simply not only been making it up but as you rightly
[3:18:36.560 --> 3:18:41.960]  say they have been tampering with the peer review process trying to interfere with reviewers
[3:18:41.960 --> 3:18:47.400]  to persuade them to pass or not to pass papers they didn't like they've been trying to bully
[3:18:47.400 --> 3:18:52.240]  journal editors whom they don't like into resigning and getting the boards of the papers to appoint
[3:18:52.240 --> 3:18:57.320]  the learned journals to appoint somebody else more agreeable to them they've been interfering
[3:18:57.320 --> 3:19:03.280]  with the process of the UN climate panel itself by saying in one case here are two papers
[3:19:03.280 --> 3:19:08.040]  we don't like because they show that we're wrong we will make sure that these papers
[3:19:08.040 --> 3:19:15.960]  do not ever get anywhere near the UN climate report for 2007 even if we have to redefine
[3:19:15.960 --> 3:19:20.680]  the peer review process in order to do it.

[3:24:09.200 --> 3:24:17.120]  I was going off a blog he got that 95 year sentence according to singing in the suspect
[3:24:17.120 --> 3:24:25.560]  in the latest shootings the killing of four cops in a suburb of Seattle this Maurice
[3:24:25.560 --> 3:24:33.680]  Clemens got 99 years in 89 for a host of charges including robberies burglary thefts bringing
[3:24:33.680 --> 3:24:39.720]  a gun to school he now has a murder warrant out on him and then he had a arrest warrants
[3:24:39.720 --> 3:24:46.160]  out he'd been arrested and been released for child rape assault of a police officer he'd
[3:24:46.160 --> 3:24:53.480]  been released from another prison sentence a few years ago for robbery I mean this guy
[3:24:53.480 --> 3:25:04.680]  has a rap sheet a million feet long and why was he released from prison oh boy absolutely
[3:25:04.680 --> 3:25:10.720]  incredible but the establishment statistically releases violent offenders quicker than they
[3:25:10.720 --> 3:25:16.760]  release nonviolent because they're used by the social engineers to kind of herd the general
[3:25:16.760 --> 3:25:22.080]  population into being so terrified they call for more police and more prisons we have more
[3:25:22.080 --> 3:25:26.880]  prisons than anybody else in the world we have more crime than many nations it's because
[3:25:26.880 --> 3:25:31.720]  we are a sick sick society and the highest crime rates are in New York City in Chicago
[3:25:31.720 --> 3:25:36.120]  where you have total gun bans because that's where all the criminals move only law abiding
[3:25:36.120 --> 3:25:41.880]  citizens then follow the unconstitutional law okay let me get into climate gate now
[3:25:41.880 --> 3:25:47.200]  that I'm gonna come back and take phone calls from Robert Robert Reed David Matt and others
[3:25:47.200 --> 3:25:52.800]  that are patiently holding we're gonna have more guests coming up this week on climate
[3:25:52.800 --> 3:25:57.800]  gate but they announced oh we accidentally destroyed all the original emails and documents
[3:25:57.800 --> 3:26:06.040]  those are our emails that were stolen a few weeks ago but they've since stolen by somebody
[3:26:06.040 --> 3:26:09.040]  inside probably who didn't want to be involved in the criminal activity because that's in
[3:26:09.040 --> 3:26:12.760]  the emails people going this is criminal we shouldn't be covering up the earth's getting
[3:26:12.760 --> 3:26:22.320]  colder this is the head UN climatology unit at East Anglia and Eastern England but then
[3:26:22.320 --> 3:26:27.400]  oh it turns out before this even broke they knew weeks ago it had been taken so they destroyed
[3:26:27.400 --> 3:26:31.760]  it all then they figured out who that makes us even more obvious to be criminals and so
[3:26:31.760 --> 3:26:36.000]  now because they've been caught engaged in fraud I'm sure they'll engage in more fraud
[3:26:36.000 --> 3:26:44.440]  and now claim they've released everything so yesterday the headline in the times of London
[3:26:44.440 --> 3:26:50.720]  trying to find it here but so many stacks of this kind of out of control today the headline
[3:26:50.720 --> 3:26:56.480]  was here it is give me a close shot on this times of London climate change data dumped
[3:26:56.480 --> 3:27:05.320]  oh we're sorry it was all erased and then now they're saying oh gee no you've got to
[3:27:05.320 --> 3:27:12.360]  believe us we actually do have all of the data and we're going to be releasing that
[3:27:12.360 --> 3:27:18.440]  now but their official story was oh we had so much data we just threw it away even though
[3:27:18.440 --> 3:27:23.440]  it was in the emails and documents which we know they didn't dump then they claimed it
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:28.420]  was dumped talk about criminal activity now they're saying oops we do have it so can we
[3:27:28.420 --> 3:27:32.600]  trust these liars to release the real data again well that'll all be a distraction from
[3:27:32.600 --> 3:27:39.040]  their real internal data that's already been leaked that they confirm was leaked and I've
[3:27:39.040 --> 3:27:43.520]  noticed phony environmentalist online writing articles about how the emails are fake when
[3:27:43.520 --> 3:27:50.360]  the university and when NASA and others admit that these are their emails it's kind of like
[3:27:50.360 --> 3:27:56.040]  two years ago neocons were still on the radio saying wmds were found in iraq even though
[3:27:56.040 --> 3:28:01.640]  bush admitted that they lied about it and wmds weren't found I mean how stupid they
[3:28:01.640 --> 3:28:06.760]  think we are well they're counting on that percentage of the population that isn't really
[3:28:06.760 --> 3:28:10.640]  paying attention and just kind of halfway hears it and wants to rationalize and make
[3:28:10.640 --> 3:28:15.560]  excuses it's kind of like the media says there's no world government no carbon tax no new world
[3:28:15.560 --> 3:28:21.240]  order being set up even as world leaders call for it and try to pass it because that's for
[3:28:21.240 --> 3:28:25.960]  the mainline public that's dumbed down they just put out that lie to neutralize whoever
[3:28:25.960 --> 3:28:31.920]  they can so that when people hear us telling the truth they think we're the liars well
[3:28:31.920 --> 3:28:38.120]  hey those emails aren't real saw it on the news hey the news says polar bears can't swim
[3:28:38.120 --> 3:28:44.000]  alex kxan locally three nights ago had a news report saying polar bears couldn't swim again
[3:28:44.000 --> 3:28:48.680]  doesn't matter if that's a complete fraud doesn't matter if they hunt on ice flows the media
[3:28:48.680 --> 3:28:53.680]  says not true polar bears can't swim they're all dying that matter of their numbers are
[3:28:53.680 --> 3:28:59.640]  up a lot of people will still believe I'm lying when I say polar bear numbers have exploded
[3:28:59.640 --> 3:29:03.840]  they will think I'm lying when I say polar bears are great swimmers and hunt seals and
[3:29:03.840 --> 3:29:09.400]  smaller whales out on the ice flows but here it is climate gate university of east anglia
[3:29:09.400 --> 3:29:15.840]  u-turn in climate change row which means fight in english I guess leading British scientists
[3:29:15.840 --> 3:29:20.200]  at the university of east anglia who were accused accused it's confirmed in their own
[3:29:20.200 --> 3:29:24.640]  emails they say they're manipulating it accused of manipulating climate change data dubbed
[3:29:24.640 --> 3:29:30.480]  the climate gate have agreed to publish their figures in full yeah I wonder what that definition
[3:29:30.480 --> 3:29:36.060]  means the u-turn by university follows a week of controversy after the emergence of hundreds
[3:29:36.060 --> 3:29:42.160]  of leaked emails stolen by hackers and published online triggering claims that the academics
[3:29:42.160 --> 3:29:48.840]  had massage statistics claims this is a whitewash folks it's on record look climate change data
[3:29:48.840 --> 3:29:56.720]  dumped then they say oh no we have it we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones

[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:47.920]  wars dot com and prison planet dot com okay listen I'm going to take your calls but earlier
[3:35:47.920 --> 3:35:51.440]  I took a lot of calls today earlier in the first two hours but I kind of will go four
[3:35:51.440 --> 3:35:54.800]  or five minutes with each caller I want to get everybody on so let's move quick robert
[3:35:54.800 --> 3:36:00.640]  in Europe thanks for holding her on the air just hung up as I went to him robert in california
[3:36:00.640 --> 3:36:06.040]  you're on the air robert in san diego all right hey alex I love you man and lord mocton
[3:36:06.040 --> 3:36:10.920]  that guy is awesome he totally rocks I was listening to that poetic treat us given earlier
[3:36:10.920 --> 3:36:14.840]  that was power packed into the point and it made me write down some stuff about the climate
[3:36:14.840 --> 3:36:20.440]  gate and first of all the climate gate hackers there should be amnesty for them let's start
[3:36:20.440 --> 3:36:24.720]  that right now well more and more the media looks like we took the bait called it hackers
[3:36:24.720 --> 3:36:30.040]  so it wouldn't be admissible in court it's people inside the evidences that leaked it
[3:36:30.040 --> 3:36:34.040]  who were involved in research and didn't want to be prosecuted later because see there was
[3:36:34.040 --> 3:36:38.520]  a four year request that almost got it released but then their bosses colluded with government
[3:36:38.520 --> 3:36:44.080]  to block it and so it looks like it's just whistleblowers all right well that that poetic
[3:36:44.080 --> 3:36:49.280]  treat us may be right down just a really one paragraph poem called al gore pimper whore
[3:36:49.280 --> 3:36:54.840]  carbon taxes for all the poor here you hear you to all you feudal peasant slaves of the
[3:36:54.840 --> 3:37:00.480]  once great u.s.a. feeding the beast of blood and gore with all your trillions forever more
[3:37:00.480 --> 3:37:05.480]  will never quench their lust you see to profit from your stupidity I mean come on people
[3:37:05.480 --> 3:37:13.320]  carbon dioxide is what trees breathe that's it very well said very well said my friend
[3:37:13.320 --> 3:37:20.560]  speaking of blood and gore there is a British fellow who works with gore in their climate
[3:37:20.560 --> 3:37:26.640]  exchange that you pay your taxes to and they wrote an editorial I've got here in my stack
[3:37:26.640 --> 3:37:34.160]  for the financial times of London Saturday saying oh we can't have a free market anymore
[3:37:34.160 --> 3:37:39.200]  it's all got to be managed by us and global warming is going to kill everyone and you
[3:37:39.200 --> 3:37:45.600]  know these guys are just desperate as they get exposed more and more I mean wasn't it
[3:37:45.600 --> 3:37:49.480]  not too long ago they said we're all going to dive an ice age then they came up with
[3:37:49.480 --> 3:37:54.560]  global warming now it's climate change a word that seems to very well fit their fault since
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:37:59.680]  there's a tsunami of eternal resistors and I just thank God for you being a true guardian
[3:37:59.680 --> 3:38:08.320]  and God bless Alex love you man I love that term eternal resistance to tyranny like Thomas
[3:38:08.320 --> 3:38:12.600]  Jefferson said that thank you Robert we love you to read in Alabama read you're on the
[3:38:12.600 --> 3:38:21.680]  air hey Alex how you doing good got a question for you do you ever research on the people
[3:38:21.680 --> 3:38:27.920]  that you haven't to hire to work for you or volunteer to do such well I've never had
[3:38:27.920 --> 3:38:34.720]  really a big enough office to hire too many people but we you know we do do some research
[3:38:34.720 --> 3:38:39.640]  on the people we hire not because we're doing anything wrong here but because feds and their
[3:38:39.640 --> 3:38:43.600]  informants will come in and try to commit crimes in our organization they've been caught
[3:38:43.600 --> 3:38:49.360]  doing that to countless other people but yeah no we do research I mean mainly I hire people
[3:38:49.360 --> 3:38:54.000]  like Curtin M. O. Paul Watson Steve Watson people like that who do the writing and key
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:59.240]  research because I've watched them for years with their own websites their own writing
[3:38:59.240 --> 3:39:04.640]  they have a clear history and I know that they're patriots who understand the new world
[3:39:04.640 --> 3:39:09.320]  order and how to fight it but that's basically how we hire people well that really wasn't
[3:39:09.320 --> 3:39:13.840]  what I was talking about I was more specific about like your forums such people like Jack
[3:39:13.840 --> 3:39:20.280]  Travis and the fact that he scanned several people out of money with his own gun company
[3:39:20.280 --> 3:39:27.440]  and you had him on your radio show promoting his $30,000 money bomb in which you hold on
[3:39:27.440 --> 3:39:31.320]  just a minute hold on hold on I mean we we didn't screen your call calling in here did
[3:39:31.320 --> 3:39:39.480]  we sir no okay but people also say all my calls are fake what's this person's name again
[3:39:39.480 --> 3:39:47.400]  Jack Travis goes by JT Coyote oh I know him I've had him on the show whenever the police
[3:39:47.400 --> 3:39:53.200]  he had a realtor in his house and they saw reloading equipment called the police on him
[3:39:53.200 --> 3:39:59.040]  and that was in the paper so we had him on but listen I appreciate your call forum moderators
[3:39:59.040 --> 3:40:06.800]  Paul Watson runs the prison planet forum and just like any other forum we end up getting
[3:40:06.800 --> 3:40:16.960]  moderators and separate from JT Coyote we've had other people like I didn't even know what
[3:40:16.960 --> 3:40:21.080]  you're talking about about him having a money bomb I mean I can't keep track of my own email
[3:40:21.080 --> 3:40:28.480]  and things I'm doing and I'm so tempted to get rid of the prison planet forum because
[3:40:28.480 --> 3:40:33.000]  it has caused us a lot of problems but it also so much good information gets posted there's
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:38.720]  so much happens but I can't sit here with what people are saying with a forum or what's
[3:40:38.720 --> 3:40:42.800]  going on or what's happening with the forum you know we've had other people that were
[3:40:42.800 --> 3:40:46.280]  forum moderators that have caused problems that we've gotten rid of and then they attack
[3:40:46.280 --> 3:40:51.840]  us and tell lies about us and it's just an endless source of problems but you look at
[3:40:51.840 --> 3:41:00.600]  the internet it's all built and based on user content on people posting and talking and
[3:41:00.600 --> 3:41:05.880]  you know I got a visit from the FBI and I got subpoenaed and in the subpoena there was
[3:41:05.880 --> 3:41:11.400]  a gag order from the federal court in California not to talk about it because they didn't want
[3:41:11.400 --> 3:41:16.700]  the person they were going after to be able to flee and I said on air we've been visited
[3:41:16.700 --> 3:41:22.480]  by the FBI and people said oh you're a liar tell us who the FBI was tell us why and then
[3:41:22.480 --> 3:41:31.160]  later it came out the Associated Press and Wired Magazine what happened what went on
[3:41:31.160 --> 3:41:36.080]  I mean I'm here doing a radio show and you know what you do on the internet decisions
[3:41:36.080 --> 3:41:41.480]  you make on the internet that's your issue and I Paul Watts here's the problem I don't
[3:41:41.480 --> 3:41:48.200]  have the funds and the money to run the forums to run the comment pages right because I would
[3:41:48.200 --> 3:41:54.640]  probably have to hire five people that I don't have money to hire just to sit in there cutting
[3:41:54.640 --> 3:42:00.160]  out anything policing people making sure people don't run their own operations their own side
[3:42:00.160 --> 3:42:06.840]  things I mean there's spam all over info wars and prison planet comments and people will
[3:42:06.840 --> 3:42:11.240]  spam every article with their products or what they're doing people will then go buy
[3:42:11.240 --> 3:42:15.800]  the product they don't like the product and they blame me I have no control over that
[3:42:15.800 --> 3:42:20.380]  and then if somebody spams everywhere we have a computer program in there that if somebody
[3:42:20.380 --> 3:42:25.720]  spams the same term over and over again it's a spam filter then they accuse me of censorship
[3:42:25.720 --> 3:42:33.680]  censorship would be if I came and shut down your website censorship would be if I mean
[3:42:33.680 --> 3:42:39.240]  it's so frustrating censorship would be if I stopped your free speech it's not censorship
[3:42:39.240 --> 3:42:44.880]  if I erase somebody's comment on info wars or prison planet or on the forum calling for
[3:42:44.880 --> 3:42:53.560]  murdering people that is not censorship or if somebody types the same term in hundreds
[3:42:53.560 --> 3:43:00.440]  of times per post and then the spam filter kicks in thinking it's spam because it is
[3:43:00.440 --> 3:43:06.520]  then they squeal and yell I will say this if some rich person wants to step forward and
[3:43:06.520 --> 3:43:18.080]  give me a yearly donation if I paid people $20,000 a year I could hire five people pretty
[3:43:18.080 --> 3:43:24.480]  close to minimum wage I could hire five people so that the weekends would be covered and
[3:43:24.480 --> 3:43:30.680]  24 hours a day we'd have a nighttime person then I could do that or I could just shut
[3:43:30.680 --> 3:43:35.400]  it all down but I almost hate to give in to people that are going wild all over the sites
[3:43:35.400 --> 3:43:40.480]  and all over the place and I'm not saying the person you called in as a bad guy I don't
[3:43:40.480 --> 3:43:45.240]  know he seems like a nice guy but also a lot of people go and become forum people or whatever
[3:43:45.240 --> 3:43:49.200]  that's why we don't have moderators on info wars and prison planet because they set up
[3:43:49.200 --> 3:43:56.120]  their own little petty kingdoms and I don't know how all this works maybe we should have
[3:43:56.120 --> 3:44:00.320]  a listener vote and just go ahead and get rid of all of it because the biggest reason
[3:44:00.320 --> 3:44:03.560]  I don't start a radio network of my own with ten Anderson to have all these hosts under
[3:44:03.560 --> 3:44:08.680]  me is I don't want to be responsible for what they say and do I want my message to be my
[3:44:08.680 --> 3:44:16.440]  message you know I want to be pure about what I'm doing but when you work with other people
[3:44:16.440 --> 3:44:23.600]  it can't stay pure but then I also want 99% of the stuff on the forum and the comments
[3:44:23.600 --> 3:44:37.760]  is great informative information so donate to us support us financially so we can hire
[3:44:37.760 --> 3:44:41.600]  the people to make this better but but I mean you know we're victims of our own success
[3:44:41.600 --> 3:44:46.640]  we're not really successful monetarily we are to a certain extent to be able to grow
[3:44:46.640 --> 3:44:54.680]  to the point we have but at the same time because we are so successful reaching people
[3:44:54.680 --> 3:44:59.000]  we have millions of people a week coming to us millions a day in many cases and I can't
[3:44:59.000 --> 3:45:04.200]  even keep track of it I mean a lot of times I'm the guy carrying the trash out up here
[3:45:04.200 --> 3:45:07.760]  you know I'm the guy that's gotta you know sometimes tell people cuz I don't really micromanage
[3:45:07.760 --> 3:45:13.960]  him to get up off their butts most people work real hard up here and see that just burned
[3:45:13.960 --> 3:45:17.320]  all our time for calls I don't have time to go to everybody else cuz I promised to play
[3:45:17.320 --> 3:45:21.280]  this clip and had a few other news items I always say I'm gonna go to calls quickly
[3:45:21.280 --> 3:45:25.600]  but the good the bad and the ugly it all takes time to discuss and in any look I know this
[3:45:25.600 --> 3:45:31.200]  I'm not the IRS coming and taking your house I'm not the Copenhagen treaty stuff Ron Paul
[3:45:31.200 --> 3:45:37.920]  isn't doing that to you and so forum moderators don't work for me it's people Watson's tried
[3:45:37.920 --> 3:45:43.080]  to choose we do need to police things more and we needed to have a rule to all the forum
[3:45:43.080 --> 3:45:47.520]  people that if they advertise their own businesses or own operations when they're I guess we
[3:45:47.520 --> 3:45:51.520]  just can't allow any solicitation fact I'm ordering them the moderators unless they
[3:45:51.520 --> 3:45:56.040]  don't be moderators anymore no more solicitation you can have solicitation to political events
[3:45:56.040 --> 3:46:01.840]  and things but no more sales of other stuff or we're just gonna ban you because I can't
[3:46:01.840 --> 3:46:06.760]  I can't deal with this I can't deal with a couple hundred thousand people a week in
[3:46:06.760 --> 3:46:11.760]  the prison planet forum all fighting with each other and and and crapping on each other
[3:46:11.760 --> 3:46:16.640]  and and going and that's what America is though I mean that's what we become and I can't let
[3:46:16.640 --> 3:46:22.360]  all that overshadow my mission and what I'm doing and so I'm busy with a lot of other
[3:46:22.360 --> 3:46:28.200]  pro projects but I've been procrastinating on a decision on the forums on the comments
[3:46:28.200 --> 3:46:34.040]  maybe we need to shut it down for a few weeks and purge the fact I'm making the decision
[3:46:34.040 --> 3:46:40.440]  right now I don't want the forum erased I want the forum locked down now it's like when
[3:46:40.440 --> 3:46:44.840]  you have a disease you need a fever to burn it out I want the forum locked and I want
[3:46:44.840 --> 3:46:50.240]  the comments closed on info wars until we at least get one or two people in here to
[3:46:50.240 --> 3:46:54.840]  try to control this and that means we gotta hire them and I'm just gonna beg for more
[3:46:54.840 --> 3:46:59.840]  money here and try to sling more videos and promote things because you know we're trying
[3:46:59.840 --> 3:47:05.600]  to fight the new world order here and I'm sick of distractions so forum shut down for
[3:47:05.600 --> 3:47:10.760]  now and are the comments shut them all down right now you want it you got it because I've
[3:47:10.760 --> 3:47:13.800]  already been thinking about this for a long time this will force me to make a decision
[3:47:13.800 --> 3:47:18.600]  on it we'll put it in purgatory can't put it in heaven or hell I'll put it in purgatory
[3:47:18.600 --> 3:47:22.320]  let's go ahead now and go to the Charlie Sheen part of the Charlie Sheen interview something
[3:47:22.320 --> 3:47:27.000]  constructive something informative something good something pure and then we'll go out
[3:47:27.000 --> 3:47:31.720]  to break and come back with it and finish up here it is well he had an idea Charlie
[3:47:31.720 --> 3:47:41.360]  Sheen director producer TV star film star and it has grown and grown 20 minutes with
[3:47:41.360 --> 3:47:47.760]  the president dot com or info wars dot com Christo Garcia the winner first place $14,000
[3:47:47.760 --> 3:47:52.600]  paid by Charlie I said we'll have second third place I'll pay that I'm gonna be covering
[3:47:52.600 --> 3:47:57.560]  that the next few days it was a lot of other great entries but Christos really was a cut
[3:47:57.560 --> 3:48:03.920]  above the rest we appreciate everybody's effort everyone wins by participating in telling
[3:48:03.920 --> 3:48:10.640]  the truth going back to Charlie Sheen Charlie when we talk privately you discuss integrity
[3:48:10.640 --> 3:48:16.240]  at the end of the day is all that matters and I know there's 20 minutes with the president
[3:48:16.240 --> 3:48:21.040]  is really feeling good right now doing the right thing Oh absolutely Alex absolutely
[3:48:21.040 --> 3:48:27.000]  and and and and the response to it regardless of of of you know how you know the mainstream
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:33.040]  media dealt with it if you if you read the blogs and the postings and everything else
[3:48:33.040 --> 3:48:38.840]  you can see that that that that it really it it really struck something with the people
[3:48:38.840 --> 3:48:44.360]  it really struck something it really you know reignited the truth movement on some level
[3:48:44.360 --> 3:48:50.120]  it it just you know even you know people on the street would come up to me randomly and
[3:48:50.120 --> 3:48:53.520]  say you know I didn't believe any of that crap until I read your piece and I went oh wait
[3:48:53.520 --> 3:48:58.880]  a minute that's a lot of that stuff is hard to debate or or disassemble and it's wow man
[3:48:58.880 --> 3:49:04.320]  you really you really open my eyes and I'm gonna start spreading the word and it's like
[3:49:04.320 --> 3:49:08.400]  you know it's like I told you at the beginning of this thing if we can if we can you know
[3:49:08.400 --> 3:49:13.520]  change one person's view and then they tell one person and so on that's how any movement
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:18.320]  begins and so you know I don't look at this as you know 20 minutes with the president
[3:49:18.320 --> 3:49:23.240]  is any kind of a failure because we didn't wind up on Larry King live or you know GMA
[3:49:23.240 --> 3:49:30.920]  or whatever you know I look at it as a as a real victory and as a as a real hope that
[3:49:30.920 --> 3:49:37.120]  that that people are you know ready to embrace the truth well it was a total success but
[3:49:37.120 --> 3:49:41.360]  every time we got the emails or you got them and you were sending them to me it was we
[3:49:41.360 --> 3:49:46.600]  want to interview you for the news and you knew they could cut all that up when you wanted
[3:49:46.600 --> 3:49:53.160]  a 50-50 live debate they would not give it to you because they wanted to be able to manipulate
[3:49:53.160 --> 3:49:58.560]  and play with what you were saying of course of course it's it's it's what they do it's
[3:49:58.560 --> 3:50:05.520]  how they do it it's what they do all day every day and then you know it's you know as long
[3:50:05.520 --> 3:50:12.240]  as they've gotten them as their as their mouthpiece then you know I don't want to say we're stuck
[3:50:12.240 --> 3:50:18.000]  in an uphill struggle but but we've got our work cut out for us people you know there's
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:24.240]  no question about that at the same time the mainstream controlled corporate press is not
[3:50:24.240 --> 3:50:28.240]  going to tell us how much success we've had Charlie you talk about people on the street
[3:50:28.240 --> 3:50:33.080]  coming up to you I've been with you and you know people come up and they bring up 911
[3:50:33.080 --> 3:50:36.920]  truth and thank you for what you've done but I'm just a little Alex Jones with a radio
[3:50:36.920 --> 3:50:42.400]  show and a and then documentary films I make my cousin was visiting from Chicago and was

[3:54:50.440 --> 3:54:59.040]  in full at prisonplanet.tv it's alright it's it's too late now as for the forum I don't
[3:54:59.040 --> 3:55:04.000]  want everybody to freak out about this I've been procrastinating too long we can't be
[3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:08.880]  doing the important work we're doing and not have a handle from my office on what's
[3:55:08.880 --> 3:55:13.800]  going on with the prisonplanet forum I mean you you let people do whatever they want is
[3:55:13.800 --> 3:55:18.800]  a constant irritant a constant distraction from what I'm doing so much good stuff is
[3:55:18.800 --> 3:55:24.440]  there as well I just have to shut it down for a while to make myself stop procrastinating
[3:55:24.440 --> 3:55:30.720]  to get some of my own people moderating it and to codify some really serious rules for
[3:55:30.720 --> 3:55:37.520]  people or it becomes a free for all and allows infiltrators and problem people to come in
[3:55:37.520 --> 3:55:43.280]  and just do whatever they want as for info wars at prisonplanet the comment sections
[3:55:43.280 --> 3:55:47.880]  I mean people will say something racist in the first comment we can check their IP and
[3:55:47.880 --> 3:55:52.520]  it's in it'll be a fed trying to get us all fighting with each other or they'll say first
[3:55:52.520 --> 3:55:55.280]  on purpose even though they're not the first commenter to get everybody to say oh you're
[3:55:55.280 --> 3:55:59.480]  an idiot because they don't want you organizing they don't want you talking they don't want
[3:55:59.480 --> 3:56:11.120]  you meeting you know I I've meant to build something where it's like meetup.com or org
[3:56:11.120 --> 3:56:16.880]  where everybody has their own little page and then people meet like minded people locally
[3:56:16.880 --> 3:56:21.520]  and we're building that for prisonplanet.tv it's just a money issue of having the IT people
[3:56:21.520 --> 3:56:25.760]  getting it done getting these projects done and we keep expanding what we're doing but
[3:56:25.760 --> 3:56:34.200]  clearly this open format of just hey wall west free for all is a problem and so I'm
[3:56:34.200 --> 3:56:42.680]  going to just lock those up the next few days to make myself focus on on cleaning it up
[3:56:42.680 --> 3:56:48.880]  doing an investigation finding out what's going on and and giving moderators the rules
[3:56:48.880 --> 3:56:55.600]  if they violate them we're gonna ban them because I mean everybody knows about the internet
[3:56:55.600 --> 3:56:59.160]  who's been on the internet it's just it's just a mess but there's also so much good
[3:56:59.160 --> 3:57:03.240]  stuff happening look at climategate how the mainstream media in the past could have ignored
[3:57:03.240 --> 3:57:08.360]  this they can't now because the alternative media drives out in the open and instead of
[3:57:08.360 --> 3:57:12.000]  callers when I go to them bringing up important issues and how we can organize and what we
[3:57:12.000 --> 3:57:16.760]  can do you know it's just all this knitting and fighting and but again that's the hair
[3:57:16.760 --> 3:57:20.600]  and the guts and the eyeballs that's the the bad stuff that's going to be mixed in with
[3:57:20.600 --> 3:57:25.560]  the good stuff and overall we couldn't be more happy with what's happening in our fighting
[3:57:25.560 --> 3:57:30.000]  against the new world order we couldn't be more excited it's hard for people to screw
[3:57:30.000 --> 3:57:34.720]  something up like fall the republic or obama deception that we sell the dvds of that support
[3:57:34.720 --> 3:57:39.360]  our operation but we also give out for free on youtube and google it's it's hard people
[3:57:39.360 --> 3:57:44.200]  to screw that up hundreds and hundreds of it's over a hundred million people conservatively
[3:57:44.200 --> 3:57:50.480]  that have seen our films online that we know of that is effective that is great and I can't
[3:57:50.480 --> 3:57:56.760]  let all this other stuff become a distraction and jeopardize what I'm doing because we're
[3:57:56.760 --> 3:58:02.960]  also so successful that we get attacked from all angles not just through co until pro but
[3:58:02.960 --> 3:58:08.040]  through just jealous envious people that are jealous of our energy our passion our courage
[3:58:08.040 --> 3:58:11.800]  so I want to salute we are change Chicago and others for confronting Al Gore couldn't
