[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:12.000]  It's Sunday, July 9th, 2023, and I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]  We've got a big broadcast lined up for you.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  Well, I tend to get a little bummed out here on air, a little pessimistic and upset,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]  because a lot of innocent people are being fed into satanic meat grinders
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000]  in a thousand different ways every day, conservatively.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  But in the main, evil is in a lot of trouble.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000]  And the Great Awakening is undoubtedly here now.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]  So I'll be completely honest with you.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]  I don't really pay attention to Hollywood, even the Christian Hollywood that's taking over
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]  and is successful while the old satanic Hollywood's dying.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  So I had not really paid any attention to the sound of freedom.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]  I like Mel Gibson a lot.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]  He's not some Johnny come lately to fight in the New World Order.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]  He's been aware of it since he was a kid.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]  I'm friends with his dad, Hutton, who was an expert on the New World Order before I was born.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]  And I like Caviezel and all that, but I thought it was a fiction movie.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]  I did a bunch of research this weekend when it hit number one, and I was like,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]  wow, this is a true story?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]  And so I kind of feel not dumb.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  I'm usually way ahead of the curve, except when you're so far ahead of the curve,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]  you kind of already know all this stuff, you think, well, what's Hollywood,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]  even if it's Christian Hollywood, going to show me?
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]  I mean, the UN has kidnapped hundreds of thousands of women and children
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]  we know of and put them in sex slavery.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000]  And it used to be all over the news, London Guardian, Associated Press,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]  until about 10 years ago.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  And big tech got so good at control that you don't even see that stuff anymore.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000]  I mean, it's in my major films, just newscast clips admitting
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]  industrial-level sex trade, sex slavery.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]  The term for it is white slavery.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000]  It has nothing to do with white people.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]  It's just the old term is white slavery, sex slavery.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]  That's the technical name for it.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]  And so I'm going to go see the movie tonight, but I've read a transcript of it.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  We've got the director and other people coming on this week, the star of it,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  all of them, big fans of those guys, Roger Stone.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]  He's on the show tomorrow.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  He hung out with Trump and Bill Gibson.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]  Roger Stone was also hanging out with Joe Rogan.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]  So that's a good thing.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]  So those guys are all together.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  The radicalization of Joe Rogan is almost complete.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]  You know, that's my main job is actually waking people up
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  across the political spectrum, especially the big dogs.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]  Been working on Rogan for 25 years, special project.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]  One of my, I don't take all the credit for it.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  There's a large, large serving of the credit to the majority of the credit
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]  for his radicalization.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  I know it's angered the system quite a bit, but seriously,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]  the system radicalized Joe Rogan because the system is radical.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]  So I was already going to start the show today and just talk about
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]  the giant awakening that is happening around the world and how amazing it is
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]  and just so much more.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]  But I just also wanted to talk about CNN, ABC News,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]  a bunch of Washington Post, New York Times.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]  The worst one was Rolling Stone.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]  Rolling Stone came out and said that, well, let me read you the headline.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000]  Sound of Freedom is QAnon conspiracy theory for fathers with brain worms.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]  Dads with brain worms.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]  Here it is.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  The Sound of Freedom is a superhero movie for dads with brain worms.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]  And it's a true story of saving kidnapped kids.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]  Does that tell you who these folks are batting for?
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]  My uncle was in secret operations with the government in Latin America
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000]  and he resigned out of his secret army commission, the CIA commission,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]  because of human trafficking of orphans in the mid-1980s.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  So I've known about this forever. It's very real.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]  And to have these sickos sit there and make jokes about it is beyond evil.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]  Just ended three plus years of UN worldwide lockdowns and restrictions
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]  and forced injections.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.000]  Russia and Ukraine have been battling in a NATO-Russia proxy war
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]  for the last year and a half.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]  Islamists have started burning down large parts of cities across Europe.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]  The U.S. border has completely collapsed.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  Millions and millions are coming across here, many of them kidnapped children.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  Fentanyl deaths for over 100,000 a year.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]  GMO products have been forced from the public.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  5G is being erected in every major industrialized country.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]  Cancer rates are exploding.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000]  Heart attacks, strokes, neurological disorders.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000]  About 25-year-olds are, quote, getting Alzheimer's.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]  Inside the mRNA injections are the programming for spike protein
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]  of the HIV delivery system growing in our brains.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  And that's just the start of the new war,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]  the transgender cults chopping the penises and breasts off of millions of children.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  But we're fighting it at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:16.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:54.000]  Thank you for joining us on this Sunday, July 9th, 2023 broadcast.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]  Okay, first off, what's left of the dinosaur corporate kleptocrat,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]  pedophile-worshipping media has further dug itself into hell.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  And I would say, I mean, they've been a zombie organization,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.000]  a zombie constellation of corporate fraudsters that have been propped up for a long time.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]  But the facade has completely blown over and fallen on the side of the highway now.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]  Whether it's the Washington Post or the New York Times or CNN,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000]  nauseating coverage defending pedophilia and saying that there is no child kidnapping,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  there is no child trafficking, it does not exist,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  and that Sound of Freedom being the number one movie at the box office,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  backed by Mel Gibson and others,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]  is the most horrible thing on earth that the world's ever seen.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]  And, of course, it's a true story, and, of course, anybody can research the U.N.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]  and giant child kidnapping rings and snuff films.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  And back before there was total corporate control 10 years ago,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]  and back to a bunch of my films,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]  it was mainstream news that the U.N. ran giant kidnapping operations all over the world.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]  So the U.N. runs this. I mean, these people run this.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]  And their apologist is the corporate media,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  and they've got such big huevos that they come out against a movie that's defeated everything at the box office,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000]  including Indiana Jones and the Temple of Feminism, the latest movie they just came out with.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]  So that's a big deal.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  We've got the director and the star of the movie and all those other great people,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]  who I know are really awake, on the show this week.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]  Congratulations to them on that.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]  But we've got to – look, I don't want to pollute the show with this.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]  Nobody wants to watch CNN clips.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]  Nobody wants to see ABC this close.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]  But they literally attack the movie and say, don't go see it.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  It's terrible.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]  There's no child trafficking.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]  I mean, they go, well, there's a little bit, but it's not a big problem.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]  Folks, it's – the biggest crime going on on Earth right now is the exploitation of children,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:04.000]  whether it's in cobalt mines or germanium mines or whether it is sex slavery or whether it's sweatshops.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]  I mean, even the New York Times admits there's hundreds of thousands of children younger than 15
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000]  working in dangerous factories overnight and not even going to school in places like Michigan and Texas.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  And that's a federal crime they're supposed to enforce, and it's not being stopped.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000]  So, I mean, you go to the border right now and see people handing over newborn babies with no IDs,
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  no DNA tests to just random strangers.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000]  We have shot the video over and over again.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]  It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]  You've all seen the footage.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]  It's on Bandai Video.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  We should repackage something of all those takes this week and call it Beyond the Sound of Freedom and just say,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]  here, here's just our footage in Texas.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]  Every time we go, it's like just drive down the street.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]  Oh, there's people handing over kids to random people.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]  Oh, here, let's just go to the airport.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]  It's the same Catholic Charities woman just handing newborn babies over here.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]  There's no ID, but I'm her mother, and she goes back outside.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  It's another one.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]  I'm the mother.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]  You're allowed to take her.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]  I give her up.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  It's criminal.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]  And then, meanwhile, if I want to fly to that same airport in Brownsville or McAllen, they literally want to grab my wiener.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]  They want to pat me down when I fly.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]  Oh, let's pat you down, old terrorist.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:22.000]  But the borders, they're just handing kids over, and they're running these headlines like, it's the same.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  There's no child trafficking.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]  There's nothing going on.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]  Just shut up.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  So, I'm going to hit that, but let me tell you what else is coming up.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  I am proud of a lot of things.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.000]  And the thing that I don't want to say proud, most satisfied about is that when I go back and talk to these key people
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  and track back what woke them up, the genesis of them waking up, it was this show and our guests, the things we've done,
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  has been, in the main, the most prominent successful organization at getting people to wake up to the new world order.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]  And so, to all the listeners and backers and supporters, you really bet on the right horse.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  You bet on your own future.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  You bet on a winner.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]  I mean, we're talking triple crown winner.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]  Not me.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:13.000]  This whole organization, the audience, the listeners, the supporters, baby, you are absolutely nailing it, okay?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]  But, man, I got to tell you, I can't even keep track of it anymore.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000]  It's not just R.K. Jr.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]  It's not just Tucker Carlson.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]  It's not just Russell Brand.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]  It's not just Joe Rogan.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  It's not just all these Congress people and all these big Hollywood people.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]  And the number one movies over and over again, everything, is anti-new world order truth.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  Joe Rogan completely comes out in the Ice Cube interview that I finally watched last week.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  And, I mean, I've got all these clips.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.000]  Like, the world government's going to enslave us and they're going to control everything we do.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  We got to stop the central bank digital currencies and it's absolute total crap for hour after hour.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  And Ice Cube, yeah, we got to stop this world government.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]  They want to control our bodies.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  They're the enemy.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:55.000]  And it's just every, folks, people say, well, are they controlled opposition?
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  No, Joe Rogan's not controlled opposition.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]  No, Ice Cube's not controlled opposition.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]  No, Mel Gibson, skip this break.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]  No, Mel Gibson is not controlled opposition.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000]  It's just now it's safe for them to tell you what they already knew.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]  Because they saw people like me coming out talking about it 25 years ago.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]  And David Aiken and others were like, well, you get attacked when you do that.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]  It's kooky.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]  And over time, they woke up, I mean, you know, show on 9-11.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]  That's a famous clip.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]  He listened all the time.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  Me and Joe have been friends 25 years.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]  And Joe knew I was right over the years.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  He would just be like, is it really that bad?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]  Really, Alex?
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  And finally, about five years ago, I got mad at him and confronted him about it.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]  And I said, you need to choose a side.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]  You either need to be against the new world order or for it.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]  And he said, you're right.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]  It's real.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]  I'm going to be against it.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  And he's done it in his own way fighting them.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]  And I'm not like the traffic cop or the policeman here that, you know,
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000]  tells people what they better do and what they, you know, it's not that.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000]  I want to beat the globalist.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]  So if somebody's my friend, and I know they're smart,
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]  and they're denying this is going on, and they're not fighting it.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]  And Joe gave me credit.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]  It's not about credit.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]  It's about this broadcast that's affecting this on record.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]  And then why you've supported it and why you should continue to.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]  Because we're in battle, folks.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]  You know, you'd think the lead ship and the attack against the enemy
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  would be the most backed out there.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]  You know, it's kind of like, oh, that guy's right now.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  Now we're all going to move forward.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]  Meanwhile, the enemy is encircling me because they don't want me to put up
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000]  the next information that's going to stop them.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]  So I got them stabbing me, literally, metaphysically, culturally, financially.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]  And so I'm just saying, hey, here's our report back to you.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  We really did good on the battlefield.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  Can we please, as an old horse, be fed and basically patted down
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]  and not put away wet?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  And I'm not complaining.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  I am so excited about our success.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]  But there is this moment of this all-going mainline and people totally getting
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]  what's going on, this explosion out there, whereas you have to understand
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]  that some of these people, and not the ones I listed, but some of them,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]  could be getting involved in the movement, not just as a bandwagon,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  but because they want to lead the wagon later.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  And that's not the people I listed, not Tucker, not Joe.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]  I know them really well.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]  I know Joe really well.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]  That's not happening.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]  It was just hard for them to admit this to themselves.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]  But there are a lot of other people that are being basically establishment-backed
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000]  that I don't trust.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]  And, look, I'm going to leave it to you to figure all this out.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]  But, I mean, Trump standing ovation, Mel Gibson with Roger Stone
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]  and Trump and Joe Rogan standing ovations.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]  I mean, we're the culture.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]  We're winning.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  The coup d'etat of the Justice Department and the coup of the new order
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]  has failed.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]  No one's buying it.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]  Everyone sees through it.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]  Trump in major polls was 67 percent of the field of Republicans.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]  Out of all the Republicans, he had 67 percent.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  Now it's over 75.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.000]  No one.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  He's 30 points ahead of Biden now in scientific polls.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  He was only five points in the election.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]  They could steal that.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000]  You can't steal a margin of 10, 20, 30 percent.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  I mean, nobody since Franklin D. Roosevelt in World War II has been this popular.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]  And he was in control.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  He was basically a dictator by that point in the war.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000]  And he did have 70 percent approval.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000]  Trump is as popular as he was right now in the real world.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]  Not in little leftist bubble pedo lands, but in the real country, in the real world,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]  people know Trump's a maverick.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  They know the system's after him, and they want him.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  And so this is really a magic moment, ladies and gentlemen, that's happening.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]  But the reason I was getting back into Rogan is this,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]  that he's hitting on all cylinders.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  He said a few months ago, because I don't have time.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]  He does prolific stuff, so I watch probably two hours a week.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  I'd love to be able to watch more, but I'm doing my own show.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]  And people sent me a clip where Rogan's like,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]  yeah, it was Alex Jones telling me about central bank digital currencies and ESGs
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000]  about three, four years ago.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]  And it's all true, and it's super dangerous.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]  We've got to really be worried about it.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]  That was a couple months ago.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  Now he goes on 30-minute breakdowns on it.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  And once Joe Rogan starts looking at something, he's really good at covering it.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]  So I've got to say, there's a real satisfaction.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]  How long have I been a long-distance swimmer, or my ship sunk,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]  and I had to swim five miles?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  I'm not in good shape, but I can still swim five miles.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]  I used to be a really good swimmer.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]  I swam two miles just a few months ago easily in the Caribbean.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000]  But the point is, it's like swimming five miles in a heavy current.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  You're almost dead, and you get to the beach,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]  and you're just exhausted and throw yourself on it.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]  And so InfoWars is kind of like that.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:30.000]  I've been on this long marathon swim against the current,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000]  and I've hit the beach, and I'm just kind of collapsed here.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]  But as I look up, I see all these other prominent people that really get it.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]  And once you get, the globalists are coming to destroy you.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000]  And once you get, they're going to build a dystopia.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]  And once you get, they're not going to let you sell out to them.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]  They want to be transhumanists.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]  They're going to be God.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  Smart people go, this is not going to work.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]  This is going to blow the earth up.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]  People are going to fight back.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  There's going to be a giant war.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000]  You're going to release new bio-weapons and lock us down?
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]  You're going to engage in all of this?
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]  It's not going to fly once people know the globalists are predators
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]  and transhumanists, psycho-depopulationists.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000]  So once you get to that breaking point, which we've gone over,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]  there's no way the New World Order wins,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]  except they may be able to destroy the planet and take us with them.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]  So now our job is to accelerate the awakening of the public
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]  and their full education, not just their somewhat awakened,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  we've got to get them really red-pilled quickly before things go black-pill.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000]  And we also have to talk to the establishment and just say,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]  listen, you know you've lost and we'll give you abstentia.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]  You can go and take some of your stolen money.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000]  People say, oh, don't be a wimp.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  We want vengeance.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]  No, you look at how wars get ended properly
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000]  because you mark them, you expose them in the media that they're bad
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  and then you destroy their name politically and culturally
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000]  and then you let them go because they will blow stuff,
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000]  they will blow the planet up if they're cornered.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]  Now I'm trying to give the globalists a way out.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000]  I'm being completely straight with them.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  There's no way you make it out of this.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]  If you want to try to run off and regroup for 50, 100 years and come back,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]  look, we'll give you another shot at it.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]  The point is that God gives you another shot at it.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]  We know that in Revelation.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000]  The point is that you're not going to win this round.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]  And I'm not the type of guy that just says let's play dice with this
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:41.000]  because there's a 60% chance if either side doesn't give up,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]  they're going to blow the planet up.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]  But we might as well just blow up the planet then
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]  because if they're in control, it's pure satanism, pure pedophilia,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000]  pure animal-human clones, them playing God,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000]  a psychotic mad scientist situation.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]  So let's just cauterize it, vaporize it.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  Look, I'm in the same boat as they are.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000]  They're ready to blow it up if they're going to lose.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]  I'm ready to blow it up if we lose too.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000]  In fact, I just want to be completely honest.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  People don't know what I really think.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]  This is next level Alex Jones.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]  I think instead of them getting full satanic control of the planet
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]  and doing this and turning us into lab rats,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000]  I think it's just best God go ahead and vaporize it if that's the right thing to do.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]  Seriously.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000]  In fact, I'm not praying to God to vaporize the earth.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]  I want to fix things.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000]  I want to turn it around.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000]  I'm saying if it gets to the point where we're not going to turn it around
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]  and God knows that and we've chosen wrong,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]  I ask for the children's sake that God not allow the earth to continue on
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]  to produce children for this thing to feed on.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]  I ask God respectively to blow the planet up immediately.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000]  Seriously.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000]  Seriously.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]  I mean, I want God to blow it up now instead of doing this, okay?
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]  And God says, you got to fix it.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  I'm on your side.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]  I'll give you discernment.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000]  I'll give you backing.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]  It's not over yet, Jones.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000]  And I know that.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]  But for a real debate with the globalists and have a real discussion with them,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  they need to know we're not backing off.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000]  We're not giving in.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]  We're not going away.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]  It's a game of chicken.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.000]  We're talking about Mel Gibson.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000]  Pull up that classic Mad Max.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]  Mad Max toe cutter scene.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]  What a B movie, man.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]  Wow.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]  They can't make movies like this good with $500 million today because they have
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  no soul.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.000]  Pull up Mad Max toe cutter chicken scene.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]  And so I just want them to know we are Mad Max.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]  In fact, we have the real – we have Mad Max on our team.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]  Okay.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]  We have Mel Gibson on our team.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]  We have all the good guys.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000]  Okay.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.000]  We're not perfect.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]  We're maniacs.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]  But you do understand we're not going to turn the car off in this chicken.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]  We're going to jam the accelerator down and aim it straight at your ass.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.000]  That's what we're telling you.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]  You need to just turn off now.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]  You need to turn off now.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000]  But, hey, it's okay.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.000]  If Tim Cook runs death camps, we know he's gay, right?
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]  As long as you're liberal.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]  As long as it's trendy.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]  So the big news.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000]  Enough about all that.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]  But you have to understand, more than just news stories or news items and all this,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]  freedom is popular.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]  Exposing the globalists is popular.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]  Standing against them is popular.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]  The New World Order does not know what to do.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:18.000]  They're in total and complete absolute panic mode right now.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]  And that's just where we are.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]  But let's not sit there and count our chickens before they're hatched.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000]  They're going to pull some major crap.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000]  I mean, they already say the Russians tomorrow are going to blow up the nuclear power plant with no evidence.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:35.000]  Now, that's not the toe-cutter scene.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]  I mean, this is.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]  Road Warrior is the second movie.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]  Mad Max is the one.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]  Go to YouTube.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]  Mad Max toe-cutter scene.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000]  That'll pull it up.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000]  I pulled it up like three years ago.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]  Let's take it down.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]  Mad Max toe-cutter scene.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000]  He's not running over motorcycles.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]  He's playing chicken with the toe-cutter.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]  And they're all like, methamphetamine.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000]  It's a great scene.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.000]  But the point is that that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]  And God, I've gotten so old, I look like the police chief in Mad Max.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000]  We're in a lot of trouble now.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]  It's all coming true.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000]  Anyways, in the Mad Max scenario, the energy's been cut off.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]  That's why society's falling apart.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]  And we live in a world where the globalists have actually artificially implemented themselves.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]  But you want me to find it for you?
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]  I bet money I can find it for you.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]  We got a big crew in there.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]  Just talk in my ear.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]  Just pop in my ear real quick and tell me that you found Mad Max toe-cutter.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000]  Still looking.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000]  I'm going to do it.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.000]  Mad Max chicken scene.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]  Yep, there it is.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]  Mad Max chicken scene.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.000]  Let me see.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]  Fast forward a little bit.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]  No, this is the end of Mad Max.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]  I'll give up.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000]  I'll come in there during the break.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]  Just stop.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]  Just pull the plug now.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000]  No more.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]  No more.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]  No more.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000]  Okay, it's not a big deal.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]  All right, so continuing, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]  Let me do this.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.000]  Let me air an important special report.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000]  I'm going to reset the broadcast because I'm really wound up today.
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]  I'm going to come back with Joe Rogan coming out against the central bank digital currencies
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]  as the mark of the beast, end of the world as you know it, which is all true.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.000]  You're like, we already know that.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]  It doesn't matter.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]  The biggest cultural people now are on our side, are awake.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]  Game over, new world order.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000]  Game over, man.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]  It's not just him.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]  It's like dominoes falling.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000]  And then I've got the serious news on China cutting off Earth minerals to the United States.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]  That is massive.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]  Dutch government collapses really for going after their farmers.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000]  They claim it's immigration.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]  It's both.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]  Something just snapped.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]  Consumer panic.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]  Search pawn shops near me.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]  Everything's going bonker, crazy land.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]  The Nation magazine reports the biggest terror threat is Asian Americans with their white
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]  supremacists running around with their tongues hanging out trying to kill everybody.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:11.000]  That's just some of what we've got for you here today, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]  So let's do this.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]  Let's air Operation Underground Railroad, part of that, since they're saying it isn't
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]  real.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000]  Here's the director on TV talking about how it's based on a true story, which is on record
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.000]  true story.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000]  Clip 18, and we'll be back after that.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000]  Tim Ballard is a former federal agent on a mission to end human trafficking around the
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]  world.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.000]  His Operation Underground Railroad has helped to rescue 6,000 survivors and arrest more
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]  than 5,000 perpetrators.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]  Tim Caviezel stars in Sound of Freedom, the new movie about Tim Ballard's real life.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:55.000]  Ephraim Graham sat down with Ballard for a closer look at the true story behind the
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]  movie.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:05.000]  We intentionally go to the darkest corners of the Earth where there is no hope.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000]  And find these kids.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000]  Cameras capture some of Tim Ballard's real life missions to rescue children from sex
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000]  trafficking.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]  And now there's an even bigger light shining in the darkness.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000]  It is the fastest growing international crime network that the world has ever seen.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000]  It has already passed the illegal arms trade, and soon it's going to pass the drug trade.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000]  At least you can sell a bag of cocaine one time to the child, five to ten times a day.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]  God's children are not for sale.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]  The Sound of Freedom, starring Jim Caviezel.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]  Jim Caviezel portrays you in the film.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000]  Your thoughts seeing him on screen as you for the first time?
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]  It's really bizarre first of all to watch.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000]  But Jim is a special case because I never thought this movie was going to be made because
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:15.000]  from concept to screen, I think I read five percent make it to the big screen.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]  A few years into their endeavor, they showed up in, I believe it was December of 2017,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]  and they said, hey, we're going to film this summer.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]  And we need to pick someone to play you.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000]  Which I never let my mind go to that place.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]  Because that's a strange question.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000]  Right out of the gate, I knew who I wanted.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.000]  I want, well, if this is a real question, the answer is Jim Caviezel.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]  And I was so adamant.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]  And I said to them, look it, I don't like Hollywood.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]  I don't trust Hollywood.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.000]  I don't know these actors.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.000]  I know Jim Caviezel loves Jesus.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000]  And that's the only real requirement I have.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000]  It was like four days.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.000]  They asked him.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]  They skipped his agents right to him.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]  And he had a really personal experience himself with human trafficking.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000]  And we didn't know about it.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.000]  He jumped right in.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]  And he's one of my best friends today.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.000]  We're super close and talking all the time.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]  Because he cares deeply.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000]  How long you been doing this?
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]  Four years now.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]  How many pedophiles you got?
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]  288.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]  How many kids you found?
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000]  Take me back, I guess, to that period of your life.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]  What was going through your heart as this is all unfolding?
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000]  There was a strange time during that decade of working in the government.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]  Because we were discovering things.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]  And sometimes I felt I was discovering things alone.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000]  Because nobody was talking about human trafficking.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]  And I would tell people these stories of the things I was coming across.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]  And no one believed me.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.000]  And the most frustrating part for me was in the U.S. government early 2000s.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]  We were focused on the end user stuff.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]  Yeah.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]  The child exploitation material hitting someone's computer.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]  But you keep asking the question, where are the kids?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000]  Where are the kids? Where are the kids?
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:02.000]  Jim Caviezel says a line in the movie that so represents how I felt.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]  When it's like, you know, this job tears you to pieces.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]  And I need a chance to put those pieces back together.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]  This job tears you to pieces.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]  And this is my one chance to put those pieces back together.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000]  When God tells you what to do.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]  Alright, so what's incredible is the U.N., look it up,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]  has literally been caught running giant child kidnapping rings all over the world.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]  The Clintons, over 10,000 children in Haiti themselves,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]  with their chief of staff, convicted smuggling kids.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]  A lot of them end up being killed in satanic rituals.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]  That was mainstream news this week.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]  African children being smuggled out to be sacrificed.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]  And meanwhile, CNN, Washington Post says none of this is true.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]  There's nothing going on.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]  I have the articles.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]  They're in on it, folks.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]  They are literally demons.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000]  You understand how evil these people are?
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]  July 4th, 2023 is here.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]  Declare independence against the globalists,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]  against Klaus Schwab, against the WF,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]  against the U.N. and their new worldwide medical treaty
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]  claiming control over not just our nation state's medical systems,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]  but our very bodies.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]  Declare independence against the federal government
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]  that's been captured at the top by globalist operatives.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]  Declare independence against Big Pharma and GMO and Bill Gates.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000]  Declare independence against Satan
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000]  and his entire operation against you and your family.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000]  And the place to join the resistance,
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.000]  to fight the new world order,
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]  and to get the latest information and intel
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000]  is InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Band.Video.

[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000]  Declare independence for Germany now.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.000]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]  out to get you and your family.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze,
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]  made by the MyPatriotSupply Ready Hour group.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000]  It's been around about 15 years,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]  became the biggest company in the last six.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]  the fancy best water filter system out there
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]  that sells for twice the price.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.000]  thousands of chemicals.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000]  There's four or five other filters out there
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000]  that are just as good.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]  for half the price of the leading competitor.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]  And the media says we're bad and a cult
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]  for telling you you should filter your water.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]  You should also filter your shower water.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]  But I'm done talking about that.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]  The point is you get the filters at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.000]  They're discounted right now.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000]  Finally back in stock.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000]  How many times have you ever spoken to your son
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000]  about his overseas business dealings?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000]  I have never spoken to my son
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]  about his overseas business dealings.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]  So let me get this straight.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.000]  The FBI was withholding from congressional oversight
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000]  a document showing that during the Obama administration,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]  Biden accepted a $10 million bribe through his son, Hunter,
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000]  to force the firing of a Ukrainian prosecutor
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:20.000]  that was investigating corruption,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]  an event that Donald Trump looked into,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]  sparking the first impeachment
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]  and forcing the arming of Ukraine,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000]  in turn setting the stage
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:28.000]  for the current war against Russia.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]  Evidence of the bribe was also in Hunter Biden's laptop,
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]  which the FBI also had,
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]  but that they swore was Russian disinformation
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000]  and infiltrated social media to censor
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000]  during the 2020 campaign,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000]  all while the FBI investigates Trump
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000]  for having classified documents,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.000]  despite the FBI admittedly letting Hillary Clinton off
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]  for a similar charge in 2016
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000]  when they were simultaneously launching
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]  the Russiagate investigation into Donald Trump
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]  using falsified evidence provided by the Clinton campaign.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]  Do I have that all straight?
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]  You're going to want to pay attention
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]  to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]  Two new incredible products
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]  are now available exclusively
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]  at mfulmorestore.com.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]  They are both clones of national
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000]  best-selling products from a major
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000]  pharmaceutical-slash-supplement maker
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000]  that are listeners and patriots
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]  that are allowing us to private label it
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000]  at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000]  It's Joint Relief Max
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]  and Nerve Renew.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]  Both of these have known,
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]  documented natural compounds
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]  that lower pain
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]  and also make your nerves healthier,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]  which is one of the major reasons
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]  nerves get irritated and are more
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]  inductive to pain.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]  There's major research behind this all.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]  You need to get Joint Relief Max
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]  from mfulmorestore.com
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]  and Nerve Renew from mfulmorestore.com
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]  exclusively at mfulmorestore.com
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]  right now.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]  Introducing them both, 25% off.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]  You'll find them exclusively at mfulmorestore.com
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000]  and they fund their operation.
[00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:08.250]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:29.250]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:29.250 --> 00:33:36.890]  All right, I am loaded for bear, super wound up, super prepared.
[00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:41.890]  I spent the last 30 minutes like a dragster, firing my engine up, spinning my wheels.
[00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:47.890]  But right now, the light turns green, ladies and gentlemen, and we go live.
[00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:50.890]  So I'm going to lay out all the biggest news and the rest of it.
[00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:57.890]  But that clip I wanted from the original Road Warriors here is an allegory of the patriots with God on our side,
[00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:00.890]  playing a game of chicken with the New World Order, and we're not going to turn off.
[00:34:00.890 --> 00:34:04.890]  They better understand we've broken their will. Here it is. Roll it.
[00:34:05.890 --> 00:34:11.890]  Bronze, huh? Metal damage. Brain damage. Are you listening, bronze?
[00:34:11.890 --> 00:34:20.890]  I am the Knight Rider. I'm a fuel-injected suicide machine.
[00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:27.890]  I am a rocker. I'm a roller. I'm a controller.
[00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:34.890]  I'm the Knight Rider, baby. And we ain't never coming back.
[00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:51.890]  True classic.
[00:34:51.890 --> 00:34:57.890]  It's a toe-cutter. He knows who I am. I am the Knight Rider.
[00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:04.890]  Imagine CNN, Washington Post. We are another disgraceful.
[00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:13.890]  Coming out and saying that there's no child kidnapping going on, and that Sound of Freedom is bad,
[00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:17.890]  but it's an on-the-record true story, and quite frankly, nothing compared to what goes on.
[00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:22.890]  I mean, they picked a completely confirmed one of these stories.
[00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:29.890]  I mean, the UN, again, has been caught literally kidnapping 10,000 children in Haiti alone.
[00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:31.890]  Guys, type into the search engine just the other day,
[00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:36.890]  children kidnapped in Africa for satanic ritual sacrifice.
[00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.890]  That was, like, mainstream news five days ago.
[00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.890]  And there goes Klaus Schwab.
[00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:54.890]  They're a little intimidated now. They already know they're losing, but they don't quit.
[00:35:54.890 --> 00:35:57.890]  Because now we're on their tail.
[00:35:57.890 --> 00:36:01.890]  And now they're not as confident as they used to be.
[00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:05.890]  Because now we have the public awakening.
[00:36:05.890 --> 00:36:10.890]  And now Bill Gates and Fauci are starting to figure out what's going on.
[00:36:10.890 --> 00:36:14.890]  The world's awake to them now.
[00:36:15.890 --> 00:36:19.890]  And it's going to get worse from here on out.
[00:36:19.890 --> 00:36:26.890]  All we've got to do is just keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing with the truth.
[00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.890]  They can try to censor, they can try to threaten, they can try to sue us.
[00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.890]  They can do whatever they want.
[00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:39.890]  But in the end, you know what happens to the bad guys.
[00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:50.890]  But of course, we know how evil works.
[00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:54.890]  They'll come back again, and we'll beat them again.
[00:36:54.890 --> 00:37:00.890]  The question is how many children are going to get shoot up and murdered and killed in the process before we stop these people.
[00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:02.890]  So there you go.
[00:37:02.890 --> 00:37:07.890]  I just had a hunger to suddenly see that, and we just played that, and there's my little allegory.
[00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:12.890]  I've got probably 200 articles here, and I've looked at them, and they're all incredible.
[00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:14.890]  Here's just one.
[00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.890]  Oh yeah, show that AP.
[00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:21.890]  Somebody ought to call CNN up and say, you say there's no child trafficking going on.
[00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:22.890]  What's this?
[00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:30.890]  AP exclusive UN child sex ring left victims with no arrests, including tens of thousands kidnapped, raped, and many murdered.
[00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:34.890]  And when AP published this, was this five years ago?
[00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:35.890]  Six years ago?
[00:37:35.890 --> 00:37:37.890]  It got no coverage.
[00:37:37.890 --> 00:37:39.890]  It was like a 25-page report.
[00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:43.890]  We had reporters down there a year before this broke.
[00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:45.890]  Gary Haven and Joe Biggs.
[00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:47.890]  Oh, where's Joe Biggs?
[00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:52.890]  Joe Biggs was there documenting kidnapped children and getting authorities to save them with Gary Haven.
[00:37:52.890 --> 00:37:53.890]  Where's Joe Biggs right now?
[00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:54.890]  Oh, he's in a federal prison.
[00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:55.890]  He's a terrorist.
[00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:58.890]  I forgot.
[00:37:58.890 --> 00:37:59.890]  So look at this.
[00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:05.890]  In fact, guys, print me a bunch of articles about sex trafficking and UN sex trafficking and UN kidnapped kids.
[00:38:06.890 --> 00:38:09.890]  You ought to go to Google Web, though, because none of it's in the news now.
[00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:10.890]  They hide it.
[00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:13.890]  We've got all the thousands of articles, congressional hearings, all of it.
[00:38:13.890 --> 00:38:15.890]  But remember, the sound of freedom is not real.
[00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:16.890]  None of it's happening.
[00:38:16.890 --> 00:38:20.890]  None of it's going on.
[00:38:20.890 --> 00:38:24.890]  Yeah, well, my uncle, my mom's brother, who was probably the coolest guy I ever knew,
[00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:33.890]  so sad he died of flash pneumonia nine years ago in 2014.
[00:38:33.890 --> 00:38:42.890]  He told me before he died that the government was smuggling children out of Central America, out of orphanages.
[00:38:42.890 --> 00:38:45.890]  Now, he told me that before he died.
[00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:53.890]  I knew he was a very good guy and an amazing person, and the top of his class in basically everything.
[00:38:53.890 --> 00:39:00.890]  The youngest person to ever have a ham radio operation license when he was like 10 years old.
[00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:08.890]  He had world records at different points in his life for Morse code, super decorated Vietnam helicopter pilot,
[00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:11.890]  and then went into secret operations.
[00:39:11.890 --> 00:39:17.890]  And he said our government kidnaps and smuggles children and kills them.
[00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:19.890]  That was William Forrest Hammond told me that.
[00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:25.890]  Oh, but I can read CNN, and they tell me none of that's going on.
[00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:29.890]  The criminals that have hijacked our government use this to compromise people,
[00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:32.890]  and you don't get in their club unless you're part of that.
[00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:34.890]  And that's who's hijacked the U.S. government.
[00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:40.890]  So remember when you see CNN or The Washington Post or The New York Times, they don't just lie to you.
[00:39:40.890 --> 00:39:41.890]  I've got all the articles, the videos.
[00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:43.890]  You want me to play them for you?
[00:39:43.890 --> 00:39:44.890]  You see it everywhere.
[00:39:44.890 --> 00:39:53.890]  They're literally saying people that believe this movie have maggots in their brains.
[00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.890]  You can read the disdain in the headlines.
[00:39:55.890 --> 00:39:56.890]  I mean, I've got a whole bunch of them here.
[00:39:56.890 --> 00:39:59.890]  They're just sick.
[00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:05.890]  They'll take a true story on record with arresting convictions and say it isn't real to you because they love it,
[00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:09.890]  because they support it.
[00:40:09.890 --> 00:40:16.890]  It was Operation Underground Railroad, 6,000 trafficking victims rescued on record.
[00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:18.890]  And what is their response?
[00:40:18.890 --> 00:40:20.890]  No, don't go see Sound of Freedom.
[00:40:20.890 --> 00:40:21.890]  It's a QAnon conspiracy.
[00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:28.890]  It's literally based on a true story, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:28.890 --> 00:40:33.890]  Report Rolling Stone writer who mocked Sound of Freedom movie locks down his Twitter profile.
[00:40:33.890 --> 00:40:35.890]  Look at this guy.
[00:40:35.890 --> 00:40:45.890]  I mean, I'm just saying somebody ought to like, I mean, he looks like Brian, got a little Brian Stelter flavor to him.
[00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:46.890]  Not going to let this guy babysit my kids.
[00:40:46.890 --> 00:40:48.890]  I'll put it to you that way.
[00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:49.890]  Yeah, here's what he wrote.
[00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:54.890]  Sound of Freedom is a superhero movie for dads with brain worms.
[00:40:54.890 --> 00:41:00.890]  You know, those dirty dads.
[00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:03.890]  And what did Biden start doing, Obama, a month ago?
[00:41:03.890 --> 00:41:11.890]  No longer does ICE, when there's an unaccompanied child from the age 18 down to three months or newborn,
[00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:15.890]  do a DNA test when they're released to the charities.
[00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.890]  They have no ID, have no idea who the kid is.
[00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:19.890]  They don't take their DNA.
[00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:23.890]  So they find them dead a year later or six months later or five years later.
[00:41:23.890 --> 00:41:25.890]  There's no ID, no ID, no DNA.
[00:41:25.890 --> 00:41:31.890]  So when they go right into those Satanist hands.
[00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:34.890]  I've been there when they're handing over babies with no paperwork at the airport.
[00:41:34.890 --> 00:41:35.890]  I don't know video.
[00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:37.890]  You've seen it.
[00:41:37.890 --> 00:41:40.890]  There's no record.
[00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:44.890]  But when we fly to the border and we try to fly out,
[00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:47.890]  we've literally, my crew's been standing there.
[00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:48.890]  We usually drive.
[00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:49.890]  We've flown some.
[00:41:49.890 --> 00:41:50.890]  My crew's been standing there before.
[00:41:50.890 --> 00:41:51.890]  We have equipment.
[00:41:51.890 --> 00:41:52.890]  We're pulled aside.
[00:41:52.890 --> 00:41:53.890]  We're doing a check.
[00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:54.890]  Hands under here.
[00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:55.890]  Guys, grab my balls.
[00:41:55.890 --> 00:41:57.890]  Grab the crew's balls.
[00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.890]  And I'm sitting there watching illegal aliens just led through,
[00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:03.890]  and little kids just led through with no nothing.
[00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:05.890]  They just have envelopes going God knows where,
[00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:12.890]  while some TSA person tugs at my wiener.
[00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.890]  That's how crazy this country is and what a joke it's become.
[00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:22.890]  But we have to admit this to ourselves and understand it.
[00:42:22.890 --> 00:42:28.890]  So the good news is their house of cards is coming down.
[00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:31.890]  Now I'm going to get into a bunch of other news when we come back.
[00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:33.890]  I'm going to get into the central major currency.
[00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:35.890]  Joe Rogan coming out, issuing this emergency warning.
[00:42:35.890 --> 00:42:36.890]  That's excellent.
[00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:39.890]  And then I'm going to get into China, cutting off rarest minerals in the United States,
[00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.890]  a gigantic deal I've warned of for more than 15 years, and it's now happened.
[00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:45.890]  I mean, this is next level.
[00:42:45.890 --> 00:42:47.890]  For those that don't know,
[00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:50.890]  you can't build Jack's squat without these two elements they just banned.
[00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.890]  You can't build a toaster.
[00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:54.890]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:01.890]  July 4th, 2023 is here.
[00:43:01.890 --> 00:43:03.890]  Declare independence against the globalists,
[00:43:03.890 --> 00:43:05.890]  against Klaus Schwab, against the WAF,
[00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:09.890]  against the UN and their new worldwide medical treaty claiming control
[00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:12.890]  over not just our nation-state's medical systems, but our very bodies.
[00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:15.890]  Declare independence against the federal government
[00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:18.890]  that's been captured at the top by globalist operatives.
[00:43:18.890 --> 00:43:22.890]  Declare independence against Big Pharma and GMO and Bill Gates.
[00:43:22.890 --> 00:43:26.890]  Declare independence against Satan and his entire operation against you and your family.
[00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:29.890]  And the place to join the resistance, to fight the New World Order,
[00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:33.890]  and to get the latest information and intel is InfoWars.com,

[00:45:30.890 --> 00:45:32.890]  But women like pink labels,
[00:45:32.890 --> 00:45:34.890]  men like different color labels,
[00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:36.890]  so it works for men as well.
[00:45:36.890 --> 00:45:38.890]  It's the same formula, it's an incredible formula,
[00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:39.890]  and it funds our operation.

[00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:05.890]  I want to say brain force is great.
[00:46:05.890 --> 00:46:07.890]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:08.890]  It is.
[00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:10.890]  But if you took it with fish oil,
[00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:13.890]  it's like the fish oil is it.
[00:46:13.890 --> 00:46:14.890]  The fish oil's better than it.
[00:46:14.890 --> 00:46:16.890]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:18.890]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:20.890]  Brain, body, heart.
[00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:21.890]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:23.890]  Krill oil is the best,
[00:46:23.890 --> 00:46:24.890]  and it'll give you the damn burps,
[00:46:24.890 --> 00:46:25.890]  and I'm sorry.
[00:46:25.890 --> 00:46:26.890]  You want something like this,
[00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:27.890]  you don't get stuff for free.
[00:46:27.890 --> 00:46:29.890]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good,
[00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:30.890]  in my view.
[00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:31.890]  I'm not making a medical statement here,
[00:46:31.890 --> 00:46:32.890]  but let me tell you something.
[00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:34.890]  When I eat five capulets of krill oil
[00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:35.890]  before I go to bed,
[00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:37.890]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:42.890]  So your brain is made basically
[00:46:42.890 --> 00:46:43.890]  out of what fish oil is.
[00:46:44.890 --> 00:46:47.890]  So we don't make a big profit off of it,
[00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:48.890]  but you notice I just obsess,
[00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:50.890]  because whatever the best is we've got,
[00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:51.890]  I just can't lie to you.
[00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:52.890]  I just can't do it.
[00:46:52.890 --> 00:46:53.890]  Info or sword.
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:29.180]  One of the biggest reasons all over the world George Soros and the criminals that have hijacked
[00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:34.060]  our government are trying to defund the police to get their people in once they brought the
[00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.339]  police into submission.
[00:47:36.339 --> 00:47:40.460]  They fire half the cops, things burn down, then they put their new police in, and then
[00:47:40.460 --> 00:47:43.700]  nobody investigates the sex trafficking.
[00:47:43.700 --> 00:47:51.419]  And when my uncle was dying, about a year before he died, he told me some of this, when
[00:47:51.419 --> 00:47:57.259]  he was dying, before he, lungs filled up, they put him on a respirator, he died, he
[00:47:57.259 --> 00:47:58.500]  lived about a week on it.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:02.299]  He said, listen, this is really dangerous, he said, I don't want to tell you this, you're
[00:48:02.299 --> 00:48:07.060]  already on it, you already know what's going on, but it's real, and that's what we saw
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:08.060]  in Central America.
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:11.259]  We were down there and I ran Contra, that's what me and some of the other men got out
[00:48:11.259 --> 00:48:12.259]  of it.
[00:48:12.259 --> 00:48:15.899]  They killed some of the people, and he goes, they killed some of the guys that got out
[00:48:15.899 --> 00:48:16.899]  of it with him.
[00:48:16.899 --> 00:48:17.899]  And they killed him.
[00:48:17.899 --> 00:48:22.259]  I mean, you understand, I got my uncle off a C-130 in Dallas when I was like eight years
[00:48:22.259 --> 00:48:23.259]  old and had no idea.
[00:48:23.259 --> 00:48:27.540]  My mom, my dad was working, we went to the Air Force Base and C-130 lands, and he comes
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:37.819]  off on crutches, and the full story, even my family doesn't know, but I mean, it's just
[00:48:37.819 --> 00:48:41.859]  insane folks, and then I see CNN saying it doesn't exist.
[00:48:41.859 --> 00:48:47.060]  I have a stack of AP Reuters articles that never got any traction about the UN running
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.500]  giant child kidnapping rings, I'll cover next hour.
[00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.819]  I mean, this is just what you can find in 10 seconds.
[00:48:52.819 --> 00:48:55.100]  There's thousands of these things.
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:49:00.100]  I mean, you read about the industrial level, like you see those cobalt mines in Congo and
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:04.259]  Africa where they're like three miles wide, you see like eight-year-old kids in there
[00:49:04.259 --> 00:49:08.779]  working 14 hours a day, and they just die, they throw them in mass graves.
[00:49:08.779 --> 00:49:13.819]  If they'll put kids in a cobalt mine, you know how toxic that stuff is?
[00:49:13.819 --> 00:49:19.819]  With no gloves, no nothing, no shoes in many cases, literally what we envision as Israelite
[00:49:19.819 --> 00:49:26.100]  slaves building Pharaoh's pyramids, you know, we see that in movies and say, oh, that really
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:27.100]  happened.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:35.339]  Well, guys, pull up a lithium mine, a cobalt mine, a geranium mine in Africa.
[00:49:35.339 --> 00:49:38.620]  Yeah, look at this.
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:41.939]  This is real.
[00:49:41.939 --> 00:49:42.939]  This is real.
[00:49:42.939 --> 00:49:46.740]  Now, if they'll do that to little kids, of course they're raping this living snot out
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:48.740]  of them, and they do it.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:55.140]  And then I have clip after clip of CNN laughing and saying, it's not happening.
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:50:01.580]  How did we produce scum of this level?
[00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:07.180]  But guys, show them a photo of a lithium or cobalt mine or a geranium mine.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:13.020]  I mean, they're like three, four, five miles wide, and there's no machines, it's people.
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:17.299]  And it caves in, and people die every hour.
[00:50:17.299 --> 00:50:23.700]  And then, again, this is electric cars that have nothing to do with the environment.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.939]  It's all a giant scam.
[00:50:25.939 --> 00:50:29.299]  Oh, God help us.
[00:50:29.299 --> 00:50:31.220]  And then it gives China full control.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:35.100]  So I'm going to hit more of this coming up next hour, I'm going to show you the headlines
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.100]  all of it.
[00:50:36.100 --> 00:50:37.100]  I mean, here's one.
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:41.580]  More than 100 U.N. peacekeepers ran a child sex ring.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:46.299]  AP report documents child sexual abuse by U.N. peacekeepers in Haiti.
[00:50:46.299 --> 00:50:51.540]  NPR, AP, AP investigation, U.N. troops lured kids in the Haiti sex ring.
[00:50:51.540 --> 00:50:53.700]  Oxfam criticized over Haiti sex claims.
[00:50:53.700 --> 00:50:56.980]  Yeah, the so-called liberal aid groups.
[00:50:56.980 --> 00:50:58.660]  Sex charges haunt U.N. forces.
[00:50:58.660 --> 00:50:59.660]  That's just in Haiti.
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:00.660]  It's all over the world, folks.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:04.060]  This is just the latest scandal.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:09.020]  And then go to Infowars.com to the articles we have, and they're full of dozens of clips.
[00:51:09.020 --> 00:51:17.460]  This one right here, Washington Post, London Guardian, all of them making jokes about it.
[00:51:17.460 --> 00:51:18.460]  It's funny.
[00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:23.939]  You go on Twitter, the left's making all these jokes about, it's so funny little kids kidnapped.
[00:51:23.939 --> 00:51:26.500]  It's so funny five, ten men raping them a day.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:27.500]  It's real.
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:31.259]  And then I look at, I'm a news junkie, so I see the news becoming a national story.
[00:51:31.259 --> 00:51:35.060]  If some black drug addict gets killed by a cop accidentally, and I don't care if it's
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:38.620]  a white drug addict, black drug addict, whatever, the point is I'm sad they're dead.
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:40.100]  That's not on purpose.
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:43.980]  And it's number one story, half the country burns, it's the end of the world, and then
[00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:49.620]  I'll see some story out of Dallas, or Austin, or Sydney, because it's on the local news.
[00:51:49.620 --> 00:51:52.319]  It's like little girls at Spurs games with dad.
[00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:56.580]  Dad went in the bathroom, told her to stand there, eight-year-old grabbed, found two weeks
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:00.500]  later in Oklahoma City in a room raped by 400 men.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:04.299]  It's like when the police got there, there were 17 men lined up to rape her, and they
[00:52:04.299 --> 00:52:09.220]  believe over 400 men raped her in two, and you're like reading local news, 400 men raped
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:15.899]  a little girl, and then you turn on CNN, and they're like, there's nothing going on.
[00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:20.220]  I got a six-year-old daughter, I got two other daughters, and I'm telling you, man, you're
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:25.060]  crossing the line, CNN, and you're crossing the line, New York Times, and Washington
[00:52:25.060 --> 00:52:29.700]  Post, and all the rest of you damn people.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:31.700]  You think it's funny what you do to us.
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:36.980]  You see us as food that you eat, you see our kids as, look at the schools, look at the
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:41.339]  drag queen pedophile time, look at all of it, it's who they are.
[00:52:41.339 --> 00:52:46.819]  They're soulless scum who have nothing, so they want our innocence, they want our children,
[00:52:46.819 --> 00:52:47.819]  they want our future.
[00:52:47.819 --> 00:52:55.299]  I have a stack of articles of mainstream media, CNN and others, bitching that oh my God, since
[00:52:55.299 --> 00:53:00.779]  abortion got restricted in Texas, there were 10,000 more births, oh, but all the illegals
[00:53:00.859 --> 00:53:04.660]  you bring in are the most precious people on earth, because you're exploiting them.
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:05.660]  They're already born.
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:13.060]  But if, oh no, Texas, we didn't kill them, they're literally bemoaning.
[00:53:13.060 --> 00:53:18.540]  There were 10,000 births in Texas.
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:24.060]  The majority of them Hispanic babies that they can't kill.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:29.859]  And this is good the crew found, but guys, type in rare earth mineral mine from space.
[00:53:29.939 --> 00:53:33.819]  I want people to see Central Africa, it's all over Africa.
[00:53:33.819 --> 00:53:39.299]  I want you to see the five mile, six mile, three mile wide craters they're in, where
[00:53:39.299 --> 00:53:40.540]  they march down into it.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:45.980]  Can we show a rare earth mineral mine from the air?
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:48.899]  You showed it the other day on the show on Friday.
[00:53:48.899 --> 00:53:52.939]  Yeah, look at that, that's a small one.
[00:53:52.939 --> 00:53:57.420]  That's about a mile wide.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:54:05.779]  Type in biggest rare earth mineral mine on earth.
[00:54:05.779 --> 00:54:11.060]  I think one of them is seven miles wide, they estimate about 300 people die a day in it.
[00:54:11.060 --> 00:54:12.660]  That's what I read a few months ago.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:13.660]  But again, it's all liberal.
[00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:17.859]  It's like, well, if the owners of the companies are like Tim Cook and a little black turtleneck,
[00:54:17.859 --> 00:54:21.020]  it's like, well, he's gay running death camps with 3 million Uyghurs.
[00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:23.500]  Like, well, I mean, he runs death camps, but he's gay.
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:25.020]  It's like, oh, okay, we get it.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:26.020]  He's gay.
[00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.020]  It's fine.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:30.980]  I haven't put the Joe Rogan clip yet, I haven't gotten to any of it yet because I'm just so
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:31.980]  wound up here.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:35.180]  But I mean, you want to know how they're going to get you, it's going to be the central bank
[00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:36.180]  digital currency.
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.100]  It's going to be, this is their mark of the beast.
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.100]  This is it.
[00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:42.779]  And people are like, oh, Joe Rogan, yeah, he's got the biggest show.
[00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:46.540]  And once he goes against the system, it's just a bellwether, everybody else is going
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:47.540]  against it.
[00:54:47.540 --> 00:54:48.540]  It shows we're waking up.
[00:54:48.540 --> 00:54:49.540]  It shows positive things are happening.
[00:54:49.540 --> 00:54:52.500]  Yeah, there's one of the bigger ones.
[00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.819]  Look at that gigantic monster.
[00:54:54.819 --> 00:55:00.020]  And do you know what all that green sludge is down in there?
[00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:06.660]  Just to mine gold, it creates a ton of cyanide and humans aren't supposed to be involved
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:07.660]  in it.
[00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:12.540]  Do you have any idea in a lithium or cobalt or any of these other mines what leeches out
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:13.540]  of that stuff?
[00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:19.460]  You're going to be dead real quick because it goes right to your skin.
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:23.500]  And then, oh, look at this little story.
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:27.939]  Wall Street Journal, China controls minerals that run the world and they just fired a warning
[00:55:27.939 --> 00:55:29.859]  shot at the U.S.
[00:55:29.859 --> 00:55:33.980]  Oh, I love the Chai Com Worshipping Media, it's right here.
[00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:36.299]  I love the Chai Com Worshipping Media.
[00:55:36.299 --> 00:55:38.259]  They didn't fire a warning shot.
[00:55:38.259 --> 00:55:44.979]  If I walk up to you and shoot you in the knee with a 12-gauge shotgun and blow your leg off
[00:55:44.979 --> 00:55:47.020]  at the knee, I didn't fire a warning shot.
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:51.700]  If I walk up to you with a meat cleaver and hack your carotid artery open, I didn't fire
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:52.700]  a warning shot.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:57.020]  I love how they spin their stuff, baby.
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:01.220]  They just cut off the key to rare earth minerals 100%.
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.100]  You're like, well, we'll just have our own mine.
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:04.100]  We don't have any mines.
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:07.500]  We're not allowed to have mines here, not diamond mines, not gold mines.
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.700]  There's not one lead smelting facility in the United States.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.700]  We're not allowed to, environmentalists.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:14.060]  That doesn't do with the environment, it's about strategic control.
[00:56:14.060 --> 00:56:17.460]  China has 98% control of rare earth minerals.
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.460]  98%.
[00:56:18.460 --> 00:56:21.660]  They didn't get it by accident, like Joe Biden does.
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:27.779]  They were given control by the criminals that run our government and set everything up over
[00:56:27.779 --> 00:56:28.779]  there.
[00:56:28.779 --> 00:56:29.779]  But I'll just be like CNN.
[00:56:29.779 --> 00:56:33.939]  They say pedophilia doesn't exist, child trapping doesn't exist, well, rare earth minerals don't
[00:56:33.939 --> 00:56:34.939]  exist.
[00:56:34.939 --> 00:56:38.500]  They can probably go, Joe Biden, rare earth minerals don't exist.
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:39.500]  China didn't cut them off.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:45.580]  So it's in all the electronics and they just cut them off, completely.
[00:56:45.580 --> 00:56:48.779]  The two, you're like, well, they didn't cut off the other 10 rare earth.
[00:56:48.779 --> 00:56:56.380]  They cut off the two you got to have to complete it, to make any microchip, total cutoff.
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:58.620]  You're like, well, I've got oil for my engine.
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:56:59.620]  You don't have gasoline.
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:01.620]  Well, no, I don't.
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:02.620]  Comprende?
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:05.500]  Comprehend what I'm saying?
[00:57:05.500 --> 00:57:06.500]  We're going to go to break.
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:09.100]  Hey, I'm not funny about George Soros, the New World Order, I'm funny about you.

[00:58:52.339 --> 00:58:53.339]  Yeah.
[00:58:53.339 --> 00:58:54.339]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:58:54.339 --> 00:58:56.380]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:59:00.380]  Four books with Dr. Judy Majkowicz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers, and now
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:02.700]  two books with Alex Jones.
[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:06.020]  That's because I use BrainForce every day.
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:09.939]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:59:09.939 --> 00:59:13.939]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:59:13.939 --> 00:59:19.339]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is BrainForce.
[00:59:19.339 --> 00:59:24.299]  I'll take BrainForce in the morning, right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for

[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:32.779]  So it really is true that BrainForce is something I use every day, and it helps me with my writing.
[00:59:32.779 --> 00:59:33.779]  All right.

[01:00:11.779 --> 01:00:14.779]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:00:14.779 --> 01:00:17.779]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:17.779 --> 01:00:18.779]  All right.
[01:00:18.779 --> 01:00:25.779]  I got one hour left before the amazing Owen Schroeder takes over.
[01:00:25.779 --> 01:00:29.779]  In one hour for two hours, Sunday night live.
[01:00:29.779 --> 01:00:32.779]  And I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, 11 a.m. Central.
[01:00:32.779 --> 01:00:35.779]  We got a big broadcast week lined up for you.
[01:00:35.779 --> 01:00:41.779]  And I've kind of been a little fired up today, a little more energetic than I have been lately.
[01:00:41.779 --> 01:00:44.779]  I kind of get the old school Alex Jones where I'm bouncing off the walls.
[01:00:44.779 --> 01:00:51.779]  We're going to just battle through all the news succinctly, very crisply, starting next segment.
[01:00:51.779 --> 01:00:57.779]  But I wanted to get to this little giblet right now.
[01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:05.779]  And this is Jen Psaki in 2022 saying that using cluster bombs is a war crime.
[01:01:05.779 --> 01:01:09.779]  And then Fareed Zakaria, which is a big globalist insider, obviously, Bilderberg guy,
[01:01:09.779 --> 01:01:13.779]  big supporter of the war in Ukraine with Soros.
[01:01:13.779 --> 01:01:15.779]  But now it's seasonable.
[01:01:15.779 --> 01:01:18.779]  It's kosher to attack Biden.
[01:01:18.779 --> 01:01:25.779]  He says he brings up Psaki's statements to Biden on this.
[01:01:25.779 --> 01:01:27.779]  And so it just shows her hypocrisy.
[01:01:27.779 --> 01:01:30.779]  Listen, all war is a war crime.
[01:01:30.779 --> 01:01:33.779]  You don't want to get in a war.
[01:01:33.779 --> 01:01:38.779]  And so when you use D.U., it stays there for billions of years and sterilizes and radiates.
[01:01:38.779 --> 01:01:39.779]  It's giving people cancer.
[01:01:39.779 --> 01:01:41.779]  So why are we using D.U. there?
[01:01:41.779 --> 01:01:44.779]  Why are people upset about cluster bombs?
[01:01:44.779 --> 01:01:48.779]  Okay, you send one missile and you hope that it's the target, a tank or a building or whoever,
[01:01:48.779 --> 01:01:50.779]  and it blows up and that's it.
[01:01:50.779 --> 01:01:57.779]  Well, you fire a missile five minutes ago because your guys on the ground lays the target
[01:01:57.779 --> 01:02:02.779]  and say that there's 100 troops out in some field or a piece of artillery.
[01:02:02.779 --> 01:02:04.779]  It may move by the time you get there.
[01:02:04.779 --> 01:02:09.779]  So you come up with a missile that's got 100 or 200 hand grenades basically in it, bomblets,
[01:02:09.779 --> 01:02:12.779]  and they shoot out and some of them don't explode.
[01:02:12.779 --> 01:02:16.779]  And five years later, a cow steps on it and blows its leg off or a little kid goes,
[01:02:16.779 --> 01:02:18.779]  what's this, blows their head off.
[01:02:18.779 --> 01:02:21.779]  Yeah, it's a terrible weapon because it lasts 30, 40 years.
[01:02:21.779 --> 01:02:27.779]  There have been people killed 45 years after Vietnam with U.S. munitions that didn't detonate.
[01:02:27.779 --> 01:02:31.779]  And the Russians have been using it.
[01:02:31.779 --> 01:02:32.779]  The Russians have been using it.
[01:02:32.779 --> 01:02:36.779]  The Ukrainians have been using it before the war officially started a year and a half ago.
[01:02:36.779 --> 01:02:38.779]  That's just the reality.
[01:02:38.779 --> 01:02:47.779]  But it's the sanctimoniousness, the sanctimonious nature of Biden and Psaki and the other clowns.
[01:02:47.779 --> 01:02:53.779]  Oh, we think Russia may be using cluster bombs when we have frontline pieces from five years ago,
[01:02:53.779 --> 01:02:56.779]  Ukraine attacking Russian-held areas.
[01:02:56.779 --> 01:02:58.779]  This war has been going on forever.
[01:02:58.779 --> 01:03:01.779]  So they're both using cluster bombs.
[01:03:01.779 --> 01:03:02.779]  Just be honest about that.
[01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.779]  So go to both clips back to back.
[01:03:04.779 --> 01:03:13.779]  Here is, just play clip four, and we won't have time to play all five, but here it is.
[01:03:13.779 --> 01:03:18.779]  There are reports of illegal cluster bombs and vacuum bombs being used by the Russians.
[01:03:18.779 --> 01:03:22.779]  If that's true, what is the next step of this administration?
[01:03:22.779 --> 01:03:30.779]  And is there a red line for how much violence will be tolerated against civilians in this manner that's illegal
[01:03:30.779 --> 01:03:33.779]  and potentially a war crime?
[01:03:33.779 --> 01:03:34.779]  It would be.
[01:03:34.779 --> 01:03:35.779]  I don't have any confirmation of that.
[01:03:35.779 --> 01:03:37.779]  We have seen the reports.
[01:03:37.779 --> 01:03:40.779]  If that were true, it would potentially be a war crime.
[01:03:40.779 --> 01:03:45.779]  Obviously, there are a range of international fora that would assess that.
[01:03:45.779 --> 01:03:47.779]  So certainly we would look to that to be a part of that.
[01:03:47.779 --> 01:03:50.779]  You have news today.
[01:03:50.779 --> 01:03:57.779]  The news is that the administration is going to provide cluster munitions to the Ukrainians.
[01:03:57.779 --> 01:04:03.779]  These are weapons that 100 nations ban, including some of our closest NATO allies.
[01:04:03.779 --> 01:04:08.779]  When there was news that the Russians might be using it, admittedly, against civilians,
[01:04:08.779 --> 01:04:14.779]  your then-press secretary said this might constitute war crimes.
[01:04:14.779 --> 01:04:19.779]  What made you change your mind and decide to give them these weapons?
[01:04:19.779 --> 01:04:20.779]  Two things for you.
[01:04:20.779 --> 01:04:23.779]  It was a very difficult decision on my part.
[01:04:23.779 --> 01:04:28.779]  And by the way, I discussed this with our allies, discussed this with our friends up on the Hill.
[01:04:28.779 --> 01:04:35.779]  And we're in a situation where Ukraine continues to be brutally attacked across the board by…
[01:04:35.779 --> 01:04:36.779]  So you hear what he just did?
[01:04:36.779 --> 01:04:38.779]  He went, we're all committing a crime.
[01:04:38.779 --> 01:04:40.779]  Congress, everybody, they're all on board with me.
[01:04:40.779 --> 01:04:44.779]  They say it's a crime, and now they're going to do it.
[01:04:44.779 --> 01:04:46.779]  When it's just a weapon of war.
[01:04:47.779 --> 01:04:49.779]  This rifle will kill people.
[01:04:49.779 --> 01:04:51.779]  That's what it's designed to do.
[01:04:51.779 --> 01:04:53.779]  And D.U.'s far worse than cluster bombs.
[01:04:53.779 --> 01:04:54.779]  Let's just have a nuclear war.
[01:04:54.779 --> 01:04:55.779]  Let's just do it.
[01:04:59.779 --> 01:05:04.779]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on Earth.
[01:05:04.779 --> 01:05:07.779]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[01:05:07.779 --> 01:05:09.779]  This is a psychotic death cult.
[01:05:09.779 --> 01:05:11.779]  Period. Case closed.
[01:05:11.779 --> 01:05:13.779]  Out to get you and your family.
[01:05:13.779 --> 01:05:18.779]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze, made by the My Patron Supply Ready Hour Group.
[01:05:18.779 --> 01:05:19.779]  It's been around about 15 years.
[01:05:19.779 --> 01:05:21.779]  It became the biggest company in the last six.
[01:05:21.779 --> 01:05:27.779]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price.
[01:05:27.779 --> 01:05:31.779]  And they made it as good in all the studies.
[01:05:31.779 --> 01:05:34.779]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals.
[01:05:34.779 --> 01:05:35.779]  But you can go pay two or three times.
[01:05:35.779 --> 01:05:38.779]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[01:05:38.779 --> 01:05:43.779]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the leading competitor.
[01:05:43.779 --> 01:05:49.779]  And the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should filter your water.
[01:05:49.779 --> 01:05:51.779]  You should also filter your shower water.
[01:05:51.779 --> 01:05:52.779]  That's another way you absorb this crap.
[01:05:52.779 --> 01:05:54.779]  But I'm done talking about that.
[01:05:54.779 --> 01:05:56.779]  The point is you can get the filters at Infowarstore.com.
[01:05:56.779 --> 01:05:57.779]  They're discounted right now.
[01:05:57.779 --> 01:05:58.779]  Finally back in stock.
[01:06:09.779 --> 01:06:18.779]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:28.779 --> 01:06:32.779]  So the United States has always used cluster bombs since World War II.
[01:06:32.779 --> 01:06:35.779]  Russia has used cluster bombs since World War II.
[01:06:35.779 --> 01:06:36.779]  We used cluster bombs in Vietnam.
[01:06:36.779 --> 01:06:37.779]  We used cluster bombs everywhere.
[01:06:37.779 --> 01:06:40.779]  We used cluster bombs in Iraq, cluster bombs in Afghanistan.
[01:06:40.779 --> 01:06:47.779]  The U.N. and the left fetishized cluster bombs because they didn't want any other countries having cluster bombs.
[01:06:47.779 --> 01:06:55.779]  And a cluster bomb is a munition that puts out a bunch of different incendiary or fragmentation devices.
[01:06:55.779 --> 01:06:58.779]  And so it comes in, it opens up.
[01:06:58.779 --> 01:07:06.779]  You could say a MIRV missile, an ICBM fired from Wyoming that goes over the North Pole to hit China is a cluster bomb.
[01:07:06.779 --> 01:07:07.779]  The warhead pops open.
[01:07:07.779 --> 01:07:13.779]  It's got 24 warheads, half of them are decoys, 12 of them are nuclear missiles, the nuclear warheads.
[01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:18.779]  And then the Chinese try to shoot them down, but they miss most of them, hit a few of the decoys.
[01:07:18.779 --> 01:07:24.779]  And then, you know, 10 warheads hit and blow up Chinese cities.
[01:07:24.779 --> 01:07:27.779]  Cluster bombs like a shotgun.
[01:07:27.779 --> 01:07:30.779]  You're like, oh, my gosh, I've heard them say like, I heard about them once.
[01:07:30.779 --> 01:07:33.779]  One shotgun fires 100 bullets.
[01:07:33.779 --> 01:07:35.779]  Well, technically it does.
[01:07:35.779 --> 01:07:39.779]  So this idea, we've got to ban these rifles, they can kill people.
[01:07:39.779 --> 01:07:41.779]  That's what cluster bombs do.
[01:07:41.779 --> 01:07:42.779]  That's what war is.
[01:07:42.779 --> 01:07:43.779]  It's a red herring.
[01:07:43.779 --> 01:07:44.779]  It means nothing.
[01:07:44.779 --> 01:07:45.779]  And I'm not defending Russia using them.
[01:07:45.779 --> 01:07:46.779]  They've been using them.
[01:07:46.779 --> 01:07:49.779]  Ukraine's been using them long before the war officially started.
[01:07:49.779 --> 01:07:56.779]  There's frontline PBS specials saying, oh, isn't it terrible the Ukrainians got caught using cluster bombs six years ago against the Russians.
[01:07:56.779 --> 01:07:58.779]  And the Russians are using them, too.
[01:07:58.779 --> 01:08:00.779]  It's how you kill infantry.
[01:08:01.779 --> 01:08:06.779]  It's how you kill a group of tanks and troops coming in as you hit them with a cluster bomb.
[01:08:06.779 --> 01:08:07.779]  DU is far worse.
[01:08:07.779 --> 01:08:10.779]  Yes, cluster bombs are bad because a few of them survive.
[01:08:10.779 --> 01:08:11.779]  A cow steps on it.
[01:08:11.779 --> 01:08:12.779]  A horse steps on it.
[01:08:12.779 --> 01:08:13.779]  Your kid steps on it.
[01:08:13.779 --> 01:08:14.779]  You step on it.
[01:08:14.779 --> 01:08:18.780]  Yeah, it's a weapon that leaves something behind.
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:20.780]  But doesn't all war do that?
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:22.780]  And I'm not lessening cluster bombs.
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:25.780]  I'm saying DU lasts billions of years.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:30.780]  You get one whiff of it and a few particles in your lungs, you're going to die of cancer in a couple of years.
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:33.780]  The former DU had the Pentagon on all of it.
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:45.780]  Our troops that are around it, just the amount that gets left on the Abrams barrel when the sabot fires out of it is enough if you get one whiff, your life's over in five years, ten years maximum.
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:51.780]  So Russia said a few months ago, you use DU, it's an act of war.
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:53.780]  We may start using tactical nuclear weapons.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:54.780]  I don't want tactical nuclear weapons.
[01:08:54.780 --> 01:08:56.780]  I wish Russia wouldn't have invaded.
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:59.780]  I wish the West wouldn't have started the war.
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:05.780]  The point is let's really talk about military stuff because here's what nobody's saying.
[01:09:05.780 --> 01:09:07.780]  And this is why you tune into this show.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:11.780]  And I don't want to say this with pleasure because I'm very upset right now because I have four children.
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:12.780]  I have a family.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:15.780]  I want to keep living, and I'm really upset.
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:23.780]  Medvedev, the former president of Russia, came out a few weeks ago and he said, let's just go ahead and have a nuclear war if this is what you want.
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:24.780]  That's sarcasm.
[01:09:24.780 --> 01:09:27.780]  He later said that to say, that's where we're going.
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:30.780]  Don't make a joke out of this.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:33.780]  When you use all these weapons, it escalates.
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:34.780]  That's what's happening.
[01:09:34.780 --> 01:09:35.780]  It escalates.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:36.780]  It escalates.
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:37.780]  It escalates.
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:52.780]  So when they come out and say, we're going to legalize cluster bombs, get Jen Psaki queued up again, when Biden and the White House and Obama and Princess Diana and all of them have harped and harped.
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:58.780]  And harped on how cluster bombs are the worst thing since death.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:01.780]  And now we're going to use them.
[01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:04.780]  I know how the globalists operate.
[01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:05.780]  I mean, I just do.
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:07.780]  And I know this is what's happening.
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:08.780]  But I'm sure, I'm sure.
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:13.780]  They're going to have a cluster bomb debate right now for the next two weeks.
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:18.780]  And in two weeks, they're going to start the announcement for delivery of F-16s.
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:21.780]  Then it's going to be Predator drones.
[01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:24.780]  And then it's full war with NATO and Russia.
[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:25.780]  Not a proxy war.
[01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:27.780]  Not a hybrid war.
[01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:42.780]  Because if they're telling you the nastiest, dirty thing in there, like cluster bombs or not, bioweapons, nerve gas, you know, that's the really nasty stuff.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:43.780]  Bioweapons are even worse.
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:46.780]  It just spreads and spreads and blows back on you.
[01:10:47.780 --> 01:10:48.780]  So there's stuff way worse.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:51.780]  But the point is, they have made cluster bombs because they don't want other countries making them.
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:57.780]  Just like they don't want you having a semi-automatic rifle to defend yourself.
[01:10:57.780 --> 01:11:00.780]  It's something that equalizes the common person.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:02.780]  So they don't want other countries having cluster bombs.
[01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:05.780]  So they made a, oh, the cluster bomb is the dirtiest thing.
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:07.780]  It's the worst thing on earth.
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:15.780]  And now they're telling you cluster bombs are fine.
[01:11:15.780 --> 01:11:17.780]  It's because they're about to say, hey, we need cluster bombs.
[01:11:17.780 --> 01:11:25.780]  So F-16s, Predator drones, Reaper drones, U.S. troops, NATO troops, Ukrainians, NATO.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:32.780]  That's what this is, is the Ukrainian offensive got destroyed.
[01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:35.780]  Half their troops reportedly, the new trained troops.
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:36.780]  Half the equipment.
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:37.780]  Total defeat.
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:41.780]  And their coup with Purgogin in his clown outfits.
[01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.780]  I mean, it does show that Putin's got problems.
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:45.780]  He's got a lunatic like that working for him.
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:47.780]  I mean, that is really bad.
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:51.780]  All of this is a giant escalation.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:53.780]  And so they're like, screw it.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:55.780]  They're sitting around their councils.
[01:11:55.780 --> 01:11:57.780]  Probably about a week ago, they go, we've lost.
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.780]  We're losing.
[01:11:58.780 --> 01:12:00.780]  This will be such a humiliation for us.
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.780]  Plus, we're child trafficking out of there.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:03.780]  We're laundering money.
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:04.780]  And we've got the bio labs.
[01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:05.780]  What do we do?
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:09.780]  Man, if we just sit in the F-16s and the rest of the weapons, it's a full war.
[01:12:09.780 --> 01:12:10.780]  What do we do?
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:11.780]  How do we get the public ready for that?
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:13.780]  Because we've made a big deal about this.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.780]  Well, we've made a big deal about cluster bombs.
[01:12:16.780 --> 01:12:18.780]  So just do the cluster bomb thing.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.780]  And then no one's going to notice after that with all the real stuff.
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.780]  Because they've been using cluster bombs the whole time.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:25.780]  Both sides.
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.780]  White phosphorus, everything.
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:28.780]  I mean, I see the footage.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:31.780]  The Russians are shooting white phosphorus cluster bombs.
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.780]  The Ukrainians are shooting.
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:35.780]  You don't think the United States, day one when the Russians tried to invade,
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:37.780]  weren't using cluster bombs against Russian infantry?
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:38.780]  You're an idiot.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:41.780]  Out of the folks over there shooting it at them.
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:46.780]  So this is horrible beyond belief.
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:48.780]  Now show that footage while cluster bombs are bad.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:49.780]  It's true.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:50.780]  Kids see this cool-looking thing.
[01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:51.780]  What's this?
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:54.780]  I mean, it's horrible.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:59.780]  But at least you know a cluster bomb blew your kid up a year after the bomb was dropped.
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:03.780]  So you know it was a cluster bomb because it makes a boom.
[01:13:03.780 --> 01:13:07.780]  But you don't get a boom.
[01:13:07.780 --> 01:13:12.780]  You don't get an explosion when they inhale DU and die of leukemia two years later.
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.780]  Or lung cancer.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:16.780]  Or they're sterilized.
[01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:19.780]  That's why they love the poison shots and the DU.
[01:13:19.780 --> 01:13:23.780]  Because you never know what hit you.
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:25.780]  So this is very bad.
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.780]  This cluster bomb thing is very bad.
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:33.780]  Because the West has been using them the whole time.
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:34.780]  And so have the Russians.
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:36.780]  It's a standard weapon.
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:38.780]  It's a missile version of a shotgun.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.780]  And so this only means one thing.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.780]  Full escalation.
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:46.780]  Sorry to have to announce that to everybody.
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:49.780]  Within two weeks they'll announce F-16s.
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:52.780]  Within one month Predator drones, Reaper drones.
[01:13:52.780 --> 01:13:55.780]  And Russia has said they will start attacking NATO bases.
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:57.780]  And we're off the races.
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:00.780]  So kiss your little ones goodbye tonight.
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:02.780]  And tuck them in.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:05.780]  Because we got a crazy pedophile running the White House.
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:09.780]  Oh, God, it's so horrible.
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.780]  And, you know, we see this big awakening in the public.
[01:14:13.780 --> 01:14:15.780]  But is it a day late, a dollar short?
[01:14:15.780 --> 01:14:17.780]  I hope it's not.
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:24.780]  But people ask, like, how are you handling all the media attacks and fake lawsuits and rigged courts and demonization campaigns?
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:27.780]  I'm like, I'm not even aware of that.
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:30.780]  I went with my daughter to the creek today.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:33.780]  And swam with her for about two hours.
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:36.780]  And there were little bitty parts coming over.
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:40.780]  Chewing on my feet and my leg.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:41.780]  Trying to get a little piece of skin.
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:43.780]  Because that's what they do to other animals in the water.
[01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:45.780]  They come and, you know, get things off of them.
[01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:46.780]  So I'm laying in the creek with her.
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:47.780]  And there's fish all over me.
[01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:49.780]  My daughter's sitting on a rock.
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:50.780]  And she's like, Daddy, they're biting you.
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:51.780]  Why don't you worry about it?
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:53.780]  I said, these fish are kissing me.
[01:14:53.780 --> 01:14:54.780]  They're just getting things off of me.
[01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:56.780]  And they think they're very sweet.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:57.780]  I said, why don't you get in the water?
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:59.780]  She got down in the water, let the fish get all over her.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:00.780]  And they were biting on her.
[01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:01.780]  And she was like, oh, this is so fun.
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:02.780]  I was like, yeah, it's great.
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:06.780]  And that's really the allegory here.
[01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:09.780]  My enemies attacking me just make me stronger.
[01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:12.780]  They're like little fish biting on me in a creek.
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:17.780]  But nuclear war and DU and open borders and fentanyl
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:20.780]  and crime everywhere and defunding police.
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:24.780]  That is my family being destroyed along with yours.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:28.780]  So we have to stop thinking about ourselves individually
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:31.780]  and start thinking about what's happening to all of us together right now.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.780]  Because let me tell you, when you look back on this,
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:34.780]  have you survived this?
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:35.780]  And I hope we do.
[01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:36.780]  You're going to go back.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:38.780]  God, why did we not know we were living through?
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:39.780]  Why didn't we know it was going to happen?
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:41.780]  It's always that way in history.
[01:15:41.780 --> 01:15:43.780]  It's always that way.
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:45.780]  I'm telling you, I can sense the doom.
[01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:46.780]  All right.
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:47.780]  I can feel death.
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:49.780]  So and I'm never wrong.
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:51.780]  People better look out.
[01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:53.780]  You better pray to God for peace right now
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.780]  because there's time to pull back from the precipice.
[01:15:58.780 --> 01:16:00.780]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show,
[01:16:00.780 --> 01:16:03.780]  joined by the one and only Greg Reiss of The Reiss Report.
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:06.780]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:09.780]  Click this QR code right above Greg Reiss.
[01:16:09.780 --> 01:16:11.780]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage,
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.780]  super male vitality,
[01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:15.780]  or what Greg has.
[01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:16.780]  Greg, what do you got there?
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:18.780]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice,
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:21.780]  get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:24.780]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it,
[01:16:24.780 --> 01:16:25.780]  wherever you want it.
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:27.780]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:29.780]  the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.780]  Absolutely.
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:37.780]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[01:16:37.780 --> 01:16:38.780]  I was telling Greg earlier,
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:40.780]  we're like the real NPR,
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:42.780]  the real NPR of the base, right?
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:45.780]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:46.780]  Take out your phone.

[01:16:47.780 --> 01:16:49.780]  It'll take you directly to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:50.780]  Buy something.
[01:16:50.780 --> 01:16:51.780]  Support the Infowars.
[01:16:51.780 --> 01:16:53.780]  Keep Alex Jones, Lauren Troyer, Harrison Smith,
[01:16:53.780 --> 01:16:55.780]  Greg Reiss, Adam King, and the rest of us on air.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:56.780]  Do it today.
[01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:57.780]  Do it now.
[01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:58.780]  Support the Infowars.
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:01.780]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book,
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:03.780]  The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:05.780]  is a historic book that documents the global,
[01:17:05.780 --> 01:17:07.780]  in their own words, plan for our future.
[01:17:07.780 --> 01:17:09.780]  That is the hellish future.
[01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:10.780]  Now you'll always,
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:11.780]  while they still allow books,
[01:17:11.780 --> 01:17:12.780]  I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.780]  be able to get an unsigned copy
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:15.780]  of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:18.780]  at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsstore.com.
[01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:20.780]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:24.780]  of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:26.780]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:28.780]  So get your copy of The Great Reset
[01:17:28.780 --> 01:17:29.780]  and the War for the World,
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.780]  a signed copy at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:33.780]  And there is a markup there
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:36.780]  because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:17:36.780 --> 01:17:38.780]  So you won't just have this historic memento
[01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:39.780]  and this powerful book,
[01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:42.780]  you'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:43.780]  I want to thank those of you
[01:17:43.780 --> 01:17:44.780]  that have gotten signed copies of the book,
[01:17:44.780 --> 01:17:46.780]  or unsigned copies.
[01:17:46.780 --> 01:17:47.780]  But I want to encourage all of you
[01:17:47.780 --> 01:17:50.780]  who haven't yet to go to Infowarsstore.com
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:51.780]  and get a signed copy
[01:17:51.780 --> 01:17:53.780]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:54.780]  and donate them to the library
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:56.780]  or give them to the local school.
[01:17:56.780 --> 01:17:57.780]  This is an Infowar.
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:58.780]  I'm counting on you,
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:17:59.780]  and thank you for your support.
[01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:02.780]  July 4th, 2023 is here.
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:04.780]  Declare independence against the globalists,
[01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:05.780]  against Klaus Schwab,
[01:18:05.780 --> 01:18:06.780]  against the WEF,
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:07.780]  against the UN
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:09.780]  and their new worldwide medical treaty
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:10.780]  claiming control over
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:12.780]  not just our nation state's medical systems
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:13.780]  but our very bodies.
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:16.780]  Declare independence against the federal government
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:17.780]  that's been captured at the top
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:19.780]  by globalist operatives.
[01:18:19.780 --> 01:18:21.780]  Declare independence against Big Pharma
[01:18:21.780 --> 01:18:23.780]  and GMO and Bill Gates.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:24.780]  Declare independence against Satan
[01:18:24.780 --> 01:18:27.780]  and his entire operation against you and your family.
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:29.780]  And the place to join the resistance,
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:30.780]  to fight the New World Order,

[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:01.780]  Leading a frontal assault
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:02.780]  on the lies
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:04.780]  of the New World Order.
[01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:06.780]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:20.780]  These two dead in the creek
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:21.780]  sound like a club.
[01:20:21.780 --> 01:20:22.780]  People sinking their feet
[01:20:22.780 --> 01:20:23.780]  in these fish tanks.
[01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:24.780]  And then the,
[01:20:24.780 --> 01:20:25.780]  the little minnows
[01:20:25.780 --> 01:20:26.780]  kind of like
[01:20:26.780 --> 01:20:27.780]  chew the dead skin
[01:20:27.780 --> 01:20:28.780]  off your feet.
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:29.780]  But if you get
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:30.780]  in like Texas creeks
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:31.780]  and rivers
[01:20:31.780 --> 01:20:32.780]  and just relax,
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:33.780]  all these perch come up.
[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:34.780]  I had like three,
[01:20:34.780 --> 01:20:35.780]  four inch perch
[01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:36.780]  like giving me a,
[01:20:36.780 --> 01:20:37.780]  kind of like a facial.
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:38.780]  I don't go get like
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:39.780]  pedicures and manicures
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:40.780]  and stuff.
[01:20:40.780 --> 01:20:41.780]  I'm sitting there
[01:20:41.780 --> 01:20:42.780]  like 50 fish
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:43.780]  and I'm sitting there
[01:20:43.780 --> 01:20:44.780]  like,
[01:20:44.780 --> 01:20:45.780]  I'm sitting there
[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:46.780]  like,
[01:20:46.780 --> 01:20:47.780]  I'm sitting there
[01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:48.780]  like 50 fish
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:49.780]  in this creek.
[01:20:49.780 --> 01:20:50.780]  So I'm just sitting
[01:20:50.780 --> 01:20:51.780]  there completely still
[01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:52.780]  and they're just
[01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:53.780]  all over me.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:54.780]  And like,
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:55.780]  it feels really good.
[01:20:55.780 --> 01:20:56.780]  They're like all,
[01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:57.780]  I ought to bring a camera crew
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:58.780]  and set a camera up
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:20:59.780]  and do it.
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:00.780]  Cause it's like,
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:01.780]  I had like 50 fish.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:02.780]  And my six year old daughter
[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:03.780]  is like waving them off.
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:04.780]  She only has like five
[01:21:04.780 --> 01:21:05.780]  or six by her feet.
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:06.780]  But I'm just laying there
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:07.780]  and there are these fish
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:08.780]  just all over me.
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:09.780]  Just like,
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:10.780]  like lawnmowers
[01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:11.780]  just going down
[01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:12.780]  eating dead skin on me.
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:13.780]  It's just crazy.
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:14.780]  That's what a magic,
[01:21:14.780 --> 01:21:15.780]  crazy planet we live on.
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:16.780]  That's like big sharks
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:17.780]  and turtles.
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:18.780]  Those little fish come up
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:19.780]  and eat like parasites
[01:21:19.780 --> 01:21:20.780]  off of them
[01:21:20.780 --> 01:21:21.780]  and their dead skin off.
[01:21:21.780 --> 01:21:22.780]  It's the same thing.
[01:21:22.780 --> 01:21:23.780]  But crazy.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:24.780]  I didn't go to the creek
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:25.780]  to do that.
[01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:26.780]  She wanted to go
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:27.780]  to the creek today.
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:28.780]  She goes,
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:29.780]  I want to go in my snorkel
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:30.780]  and I want to see
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:31.780]  crawdads and fish.
[01:21:31.780 --> 01:21:32.780]  Cause there's beautiful
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:33.780]  sunfish in there
[01:21:33.780 --> 01:21:34.780]  and we can go anywhere.
[01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:35.780]  But I found this little
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:36.780]  spot off the road
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:37.780]  that nobody goes to.
[01:21:37.780 --> 01:21:38.780]  We go down this hill,
[01:21:38.780 --> 01:21:39.780]  park our car,
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:40.780]  nobody's there
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:41.780]  between two hills.
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:42.780]  Cause most of Martin Creek
[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:43.780]  is full of people
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:44.780]  but they don't know
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:45.780]  the spots to go.
[01:21:45.780 --> 01:21:46.780]  We're in the creek
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:47.780]  and hanging out
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:48.780]  with the fish.
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:49.780]  It's just amazing.
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:50.780]  Absolutely amazing.
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:51.780]  And that's what's so
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.780]  beautiful about this world.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:53.780]  You know,
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:54.780]  we fight not because
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:55.780]  we hate the globalists.
[01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:56.780]  Though I do dislike them
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:21:57.780]  quite a bit.
[01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:58.780]  I do hate them.
[01:21:58.780 --> 01:21:59.780]  I fight because I love
[01:21:59.780 --> 01:22:00.780]  my daughter and my family.
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:01.780]  And I love you.
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:02.780]  I mean,
[01:22:02.780 --> 01:22:03.780]  I really have empathy.
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:04.780]  And I've said this before.
[01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:05.780]  Empathy is actually
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:06.780]  a very selfish thing.
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:07.780]  When you don't have
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:08.780]  empathy for people,
[01:22:08.780 --> 01:22:09.780]  you don't care about
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:10.780]  yourself either.
[01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:11.780]  And blind empathy
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:12.780]  is a very selfish thing.
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:13.780]  And blind empathy
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:14.780]  is a very selfish thing.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:15.780]  And blind empathy though
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:16.780]  is what the globalists create.
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:17.780]  Oh, do this.
[01:22:17.780 --> 01:22:18.780]  Be liberal.
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:19.780]  Oh, cause they know
[01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:20.780]  you have empathy.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:21.780]  They manipulate your empathy.
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:22.780]  You've got to spend
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:23.780]  your empathy
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:24.780]  where you know
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:25.780]  it's properly spent.
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:26.780]  So that's important.
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:27.780]  Don't have blind empathy
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:28.780]  but definitely have,
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:29.780]  you know,
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:30.780]  empathy.
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.780]  You know,
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:32.780]  little crabs
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:33.780]  will come over
[01:22:33.780 --> 01:22:34.780]  in the ocean
[01:22:34.780 --> 01:22:35.780]  and do this too.
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:36.780]  But it's just crazy.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:37.780]  But let's move on.
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:38.780]  We have more serious
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:39.780]  issues to hit
[01:22:39.780 --> 01:22:40.780]  than having fish
[01:22:40.780 --> 01:22:41.780]  feed on you.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:42.780]  I'm serious.
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:43.780]  I have like 50 of them
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:44.780]  on me today.
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:45.780]  It was crazy.
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:46.780]  I sat there
[01:22:46.780 --> 01:22:47.780]  completely still
[01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:48.780]  for like 30 minutes
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:49.780]  and I had just
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:50.780]  sun perch,
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:51.780]  bluegills.
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:52.780]  There were all
[01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:53.780]  different types.
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:54.780]  Pink ones,
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:55.780]  brown ones,
[01:22:55.780 --> 01:22:56.780]  red ones.
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:57.780]  These little fish
[01:22:57.780 --> 01:22:58.780]  all over me.
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:22:59.780]  It was like
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:00.780]  a piranha action
[01:23:00.780 --> 01:23:01.780]  and kind of fun.
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:02.780]  But the main thing
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:03.780]  I was doing
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:04.780]  as I shaved my head
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:05.780]  was getting some
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:06.780]  sun on my head
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:07.780]  so I don't have
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:08.780]  white sidewalls.
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:09.780]  You know what I mean?
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:10.780]  You know,
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:11.780]  why should we even
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:12.780]  talk about the
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:13.780]  new world order?
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:14.780]  Let's just talk about the
[01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:15.780]  ...
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:16.780]  I was walking
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:17.780]  back up to the car
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:18.780]  after being two hours
[01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:19.780]  down at the creek
[01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:20.780]  and swimming
[01:23:20.780 --> 01:23:21.780]  and snorkels
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:22.780]  and seeing fish
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:23.780]  and crawdads
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:24.780]  and flowers
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:25.780]  and dragonflies
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:26.780]  and some deer
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:27.780]  came out.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:28.780]  We saw them
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:29.780]  and I get back up
[01:23:29.780 --> 01:23:30.780]  to the car
[01:23:30.780 --> 01:23:31.780]  by the bridge
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:32.780]  and I look up
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:33.780]  and a car drives by
[01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:34.780]  and goes,
[01:23:34.780 --> 01:23:35.780]  we love Alex Jones
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:36.780]  and honks their horn
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:37.780]  and my daughter
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:38.780]  looks at me with love
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:39.780]  and I go,
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:40.780]  look at that honey
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:41.780]  and right there's
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:42.780]  the moon
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:43.780]  during the day.
[01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:44.780]  It was just
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:45.780]  so magic.
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:46.780]  Two hours
[01:23:46.780 --> 01:23:47.780]  of ecstasy.
[01:23:47.780 --> 01:23:48.780]  No drugs,
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:49.780]  no alcohol,
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:50.780]  nothing,
[01:23:50.780 --> 01:23:51.780]  but God's creation
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:52.780]  literally bathing
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.780]  in God's creation
[01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:54.780]  literally energizing
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:55.780]  ourselves
[01:23:55.780 --> 01:23:56.780]  and being part of that
[01:23:56.780 --> 01:23:57.780]  was so effervescent.
[01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:58.780]  It was so good.
[01:23:58.780 --> 01:23:59.780]  It was so pure.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:00.780]  It was so strong.
[01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:01.780]  And now we're back
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:02.780]  in the war
[01:24:02.780 --> 01:24:03.780]  because if we don't
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:04.780]  fight the tyrants
[01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:05.780]  they will destroy
[01:24:05.780 --> 01:24:06.780]  everything
[01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:07.780]  and they will destroy
[01:24:07.780 --> 01:24:08.780]  our energy
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:09.780]  and they will
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:10.780]  destroy our
[01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:11.780]  and they will destroy
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:12.780]  our innocence
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:13.780]  and we can't let them
[01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:14.780]  do that.
[01:24:14.780 --> 01:24:15.780]  So without further ado
[01:24:15.780 --> 01:24:16.780]  we've still got
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.780]  35 minutes left.
[01:24:17.780 --> 01:24:18.780]  Let me go ahead
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:19.780]  and start getting
[01:24:19.780 --> 01:24:20.780]  into the news.
[01:24:20.780 --> 01:24:21.780]  I said I'd get to.
[01:24:21.780 --> 01:24:22.780]  The Ice Cube interview
[01:24:22.780 --> 01:24:23.780]  a week and a half ago
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:24.780]  with Joe Rogan
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:25.780]  was incredible.
[01:24:25.780 --> 01:24:26.780]  I finally listened to it
[01:24:26.780 --> 01:24:27.780]  five or six days ago.
[01:24:27.780 --> 01:24:28.780]  Here's a short clip
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:29.780]  and again,
[01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:30.780]  you already know
[01:24:30.780 --> 01:24:31.780]  all this,
[01:24:31.780 --> 01:24:32.780]  but remember
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:33.780]  when he's ready
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:34.780]  to say this
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:35.780]  and do all this
[01:24:35.780 --> 01:24:36.780]  with the biggest show
[01:24:36.780 --> 01:24:37.780]  out there right now
[01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:38.780]  and it's happening
[01:24:38.780 --> 01:24:39.780]  everywhere
[01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:41.780]  else,
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:42.780]  it shows that
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:43.780]  this is what's
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:44.780]  most popular,
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:45.780]  this is what's winning
[01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:46.780]  and we have to get
[01:24:46.780 --> 01:24:47.780]  mainstream.
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:48.780]  Not change our views,
[01:24:48.780 --> 01:24:49.780]  make mainstream us.
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:50.780]  So we have to be
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:51.780]  ready to win.
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:52.780]  We have to be ready
[01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:53.780]  to see what we're
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:54.780]  talking about,
[01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:55.780]  what we're pushing,
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:56.780]  freedom,
[01:24:56.780 --> 01:24:57.780]  and not living
[01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:58.780]  under tyranny.
[01:24:58.780 --> 01:24:59.780]  We have to be ready
[01:24:59.780 --> 01:25:00.780]  to win,
[01:25:00.780 --> 01:25:01.780]  not say well
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:02.780]  if we're winning
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:03.780]  it must be controlled.
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:04.780]  No, I know Joe,
[01:25:04.780 --> 01:25:05.780]  it's not controlled.
[01:25:05.780 --> 01:25:06.780]  I'm the guy,
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:07.780]  Joe says,
[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:08.780]  woke him up
[01:25:08.780 --> 01:25:09.780]  and said,
[01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:10.780]  there's only good
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:11.780]  in what he's doing here.
[01:25:11.780 --> 01:25:12.780]  This is a very,
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:13.780]  very exciting moment
[01:25:13.780 --> 01:25:14.780]  because the holy grail
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:15.780]  of tyranny,
[01:25:15.780 --> 01:25:16.780]  the big kahuna,
[01:25:16.780 --> 01:25:17.780]  the mac daddy,
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:18.780]  their golden ring,
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:19.780]  their goal,
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:20.780]  what they're going for
[01:25:20.780 --> 01:25:21.780]  is this system.
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:22.780]  Here's Joe Rogan
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:23.780]  talking about it
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:24.780]  with Ice Cube.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:25.780]  I'm hoping people
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:26.780]  wake up enough
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:27.780]  to at least
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:28.780]  slow it down
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:29.780]  because people
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:30.780]  are pushing
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:31.780]  in a very obvious
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:32.780]  and very specific
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:33.780]  direction.
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:34.780]  They want digital
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:35.780]  currency,
[01:25:35.780 --> 01:25:36.780]  centralized digital
[01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:37.780]  currency that they
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:38.780]  can control
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:39.780]  and they want to
[01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:40.780]  get everybody
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:41.780]  on a social credit
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:42.780]  score system
[01:25:42.780 --> 01:25:43.780]  and they're probably
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:44.780]  connected to some
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:45.780]  sort of a vaccine app
[01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:46.780]  or if you want to
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:47.780]  travel around,
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:48.780]  all they would need
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:49.780]  is another pandemic
[01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:50.780]  to try to push
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:51.780]  that through
[01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:52.780]  and they're already
[01:25:52.780 --> 01:25:53.780]  talking about that.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:54.780]  It's very spooky
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:55.780]  because when you
[01:25:55.780 --> 01:25:56.780]  look into the history
[01:25:56.780 --> 01:25:57.780]  of this lab
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:58.780]  and them funding it
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:25:59.780]  and this getting out
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:00.780]  and the way they
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:01.780]  responded to it,
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:02.780]  the whole thing
[01:26:02.780 --> 01:26:03.780]  is so scary
[01:26:03.780 --> 01:26:04.780]  because it was effective.
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:05.780]  It was effective
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:06.780]  and very,
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:07.780]  they made a lot
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:08.780]  of fucking money
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:09.780]  and if they could
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:10.780]  do something
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:11.780]  similar again
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:12.780]  and then clamp
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:13.780]  down more
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:14.780]  on people,
[01:26:14.780 --> 01:26:15.780]  that's what scares me.
[01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:16.780]  This talk of
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:17.780]  centralized digital
[01:26:17.780 --> 01:26:18.780]  currency,
[01:26:18.780 --> 01:26:19.780]  that's what they
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:20.780]  have in China.
[01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:21.780]  If you fuck up
[01:26:21.780 --> 01:26:22.780]  in China
[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:23.780]  and you get a bad
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:24.780]  social credit score
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:25.780]  because you tweeted
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:26.780]  something they
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:27.780]  didn't like,
[01:26:27.780 --> 01:26:28.780]  now you can't
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:29.780]  buy a plane ticket.
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:30.780]  Now you can't
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:31.780]  buy a car.
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:32.780]  Now you can't
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:33.780]  get a loan.
[01:26:33.780 --> 01:26:34.780]  Now you can't
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:35.780]  do something.
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:36.780]  That's part of that.
[01:26:36.780 --> 01:26:37.780]  Now they got you.
[01:26:37.780 --> 01:26:38.780]  Yep.
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:39.780]  They got you.
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:40.780]  Once you self-censor,
[01:26:40.780 --> 01:26:41.780]  got you where
[01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:42.780]  they want you.
[01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:43.780]  And we know
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:44.780]  that they were
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:45.780]  involved in Twitter.
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:46.780]  We know that the
[01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:47.780]  government was involved
[01:26:47.780 --> 01:26:48.780]  in silencing
[01:26:48.780 --> 01:26:49.780]  different voices.
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:50.780]  You know,
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:51.780]  they stopped that
[01:26:51.780 --> 01:26:52.780]  Hunter Biden laptop
[01:26:52.780 --> 01:26:53.780]  story from getting out
[01:26:53.780 --> 01:26:54.780]  before the election.
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:55.780]  It's just,
[01:26:55.780 --> 01:26:56.780]  it's so obviously
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:57.780]  dirty.
[01:26:57.780 --> 01:26:58.780]  Okay,
[01:26:58.780 --> 01:26:59.780]  so for those of us
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:00.780]  that have been awake
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:01.780]  long before this,
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:02.780]  we're like,
[01:27:02.780 --> 01:27:03.780]  okay,
[01:27:03.780 --> 01:27:04.780]  tell us something
[01:27:04.780 --> 01:27:05.780]  about this.
[01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:06.780]  I get so many
[01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:07.780]  calls and prominent
[01:27:07.780 --> 01:27:08.780]  people going,
[01:27:08.780 --> 01:27:09.780]  man,
[01:27:09.780 --> 01:27:10.780]  Russell Brand,
[01:27:10.780 --> 01:27:11.780]  Tucker Carlson,
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:12.780]  Joe Rogan,
[01:27:12.780 --> 01:27:13.780]  it's everything you
[01:27:13.780 --> 01:27:14.780]  said 10 years ago,
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:15.780]  20 years ago.
[01:27:15.780 --> 01:27:16.780]  You know,
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:17.780]  I'm like,
[01:27:17.780 --> 01:27:18.780]  great,
[01:27:18.780 --> 01:27:19.780]  great,
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:20.780]  because I'm not
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:21.780]  here to be the guy
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:22.780]  that this is my
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:23.780]  information,
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:24.780]  and you get it
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:25.780]  from me,
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:26.780]  and I'm not in
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:27.780]  competition with
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:28.780]  these guys.
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:29.780]  I want to beat
[01:27:29.780 --> 01:27:30.780]  the globalists.
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:31.780]  I want to stop
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:32.780]  the new world order.
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:33.780]  I want to have a
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:34.780]  free world.
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:35.780]  And I got some
[01:27:35.780 --> 01:27:36.780]  examples of that
[01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:37.780]  coming up.
[01:27:37.780 --> 01:27:38.780]  They're sabotaging
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:39.780]  the self-driving
[01:27:39.780 --> 01:27:40.780]  cars all over the
[01:27:40.780 --> 01:27:41.780]  world,
[01:27:41.780 --> 01:27:42.780]  including here
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:43.780]  in the United States.
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:44.780]  And again,
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:45.780]  total civil
[01:27:45.780 --> 01:27:46.780]  disobedience.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:47.780]  I'm not against
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:48.780]  new technology,
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:49.780]  but it's being
[01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:50.780]  deployed to enslave
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:51.780]  us and control us,
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:52.780]  and I say
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:53.780]  more power to
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:54.780]  people.
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:55.780]  In fact,
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:56.780]  I'm surprised
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:57.780]  they're just
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:58.780]  putting traffic
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:27:59.780]  cones over
[01:27:59.780 --> 01:28:00.780]  the robots,
[01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:01.780]  cameras,
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:02.780]  and systems.
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:03.780]  They're not
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:04.780]  putting baseball
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:05.780]  bats through
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:06.780]  its antennas
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:07.780]  and the rest
[01:28:07.780 --> 01:28:08.780]  of it,
[01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:09.780]  because it's one
[01:28:09.780 --> 01:28:10.780]  thing not to
[01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:11.780]  send a human
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:12.780]  out to pull
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:13.780]  the cone off.
[01:28:13.780 --> 01:28:14.780]  Why not just
[01:28:14.780 --> 01:28:15.780]  top that son
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:16.780]  of a bitch
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:17.780]  over?
[01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:18.780]  You know what
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:19.780]  I mean?
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:20.780]  Because it's
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:21.780]  designed to
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:22.780]  displace us.
[01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:23.780]  It's not there
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:24.780]  to empower us.
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:25.780]  It's being
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:26.780]  deployed against
[01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:27.780]  us.
[01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:28.780]  All of it
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:29.780]  is.
[01:28:29.780 --> 01:28:30.780]  Now,
[01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:31.780]  I'm not
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:32.780]  against
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:33.780]  technology,
[01:28:33.780 --> 01:28:34.780]  but it's
[01:28:34.780 --> 01:28:35.780]  being
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:36.780]  deployed to
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:37.780]  enslave
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:38.780]  us and
[01:28:38.780 --> 01:28:39.780]  control
[01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:40.780]  us,
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:41.780]  and I
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:42.780]  say
[01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:43.780]  more power
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:44.780]  to
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:45.780]  people.
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:46.780]  In fact,
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:47.780]  I'm surprised
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:48.780]  they're just
[01:28:48.780 --> 01:28:49.780]  putting traffic
[01:28:49.780 --> 01:28:50.780]  cones over
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:51.780]  the robots,
[01:28:51.780 --> 01:28:52.780]  cameras,
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:53.780]  and systems.
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:54.780]  You know what
[01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:55.780]  I mean?
[01:28:55.780 --> 01:28:56.780]  Because it's one
[01:28:56.780 --> 01:28:57.780]  thing not to
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:28:58.780]  send a human
[01:28:58.780 --> 01:28:59.780]  out to
[01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:00.780]  pull the
[01:29:00.780 --> 01:29:01.780]  cone off
[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:02.780]  of
[01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:03.780]  a
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:04.780]  robot,
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:05.780]  but it's

[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:13.780]  and
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:14.780]  control
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:15.780]  it.
[01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:16.780]  You know
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:17.780]  what I

[01:33:07.890 --> 01:33:27.890]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:51.690]  You know who I bet on?
[01:33:51.690 --> 01:33:54.090]  The people of this planet.
[01:33:54.090 --> 01:33:56.970]  And I'm never going to back down.
[01:33:56.970 --> 01:34:00.650]  Our ancestors fought so hard for us to be here together, and I just love every damn
[01:34:00.650 --> 01:34:01.650]  one of you.
[01:34:01.650 --> 01:34:02.650]  And we're going to win.
[01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:03.650]  And God is 100% real.
[01:34:03.650 --> 01:34:05.410]  Make no mistake about that.
[01:34:05.410 --> 01:34:06.730]  But you better get down to reality.
[01:34:06.730 --> 01:34:07.730]  Satan's real as well.
[01:34:07.730 --> 01:34:08.730]  Woo!
[01:34:08.730 --> 01:34:09.730]  That's why I'm a song right here.
[01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:31.530]  The only way you can travel is on that road.
[01:34:31.530 --> 01:34:35.010]  God's not giving you a ticket if you're a coward and if you're against humanity.
[01:34:35.010 --> 01:34:42.010]  That's why these Satanists have already lost.
[01:34:42.010 --> 01:34:50.850]  All right, now, I'm fully loaded today with news and information, but I have not dropped
[01:34:50.850 --> 01:34:51.850]  the ball.
[01:34:51.850 --> 01:34:52.850]  I've had some fun.
[01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:53.850]  I'm in a good mood, actually.
[01:34:53.850 --> 01:34:54.850]  Who wouldn't be?
[01:34:54.850 --> 01:34:55.850]  I was out in the creek for two hours.
[01:34:55.850 --> 01:34:58.930]  I'm going to go back right now.
[01:34:58.930 --> 01:35:01.490]  But my daughter's like, can we come build a fire here?
[01:35:01.490 --> 01:35:02.850]  Can we go down there all the time?
[01:35:02.850 --> 01:35:03.850]  Can we stay here, Dad?
[01:35:03.850 --> 01:35:05.810]  And I'm like, no, we can't stay here.
[01:35:05.810 --> 01:35:06.810]  Well, we can camp.
[01:35:06.810 --> 01:35:09.930]  And I go, no, that's all private property on both sides.
[01:35:09.930 --> 01:35:13.530]  This is public land, but you just can't camp here.
[01:35:13.530 --> 01:35:14.530]  And who knows?
[01:35:14.530 --> 01:35:15.530]  Maybe we will.
[01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:18.170]  But the point is that we're designed to be outside.
[01:35:18.170 --> 01:35:20.970]  Elon Musk last week said, say he's a good guy, say he's a bad guy.
[01:35:20.970 --> 01:35:22.810]  He said, stop getting on Twitter.
[01:35:22.810 --> 01:35:25.090]  Go outside.
[01:35:25.090 --> 01:35:27.850]  That's really a real statement.
[01:35:27.850 --> 01:35:30.090]  That's what it's all about.
[01:35:30.090 --> 01:35:33.690]  So let me go ahead and get into this news I mentioned here.
[01:35:34.530 --> 01:35:35.530]  This is a big deal.
[01:35:35.530 --> 01:35:38.330]  And quite frankly, I could talk about this like I always say for the whole show.
[01:35:38.330 --> 01:35:40.290]  But we don't have time to do that.
[01:35:40.290 --> 01:35:42.170]  Look at this.
[01:35:42.170 --> 01:35:48.810]  Look at this constellation of news right here.
[01:35:48.810 --> 01:35:53.250]  China controls minerals that run the world.
[01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:57.290]  And it just fired a warning shot at the US.
[01:35:57.290 --> 01:36:02.850]  Will you guys pull up film footage of the Hindenburg exploding, please?
[01:36:03.010 --> 01:36:04.010]  There's photos.
[01:36:04.010 --> 01:36:09.290]  There's also a quick five second, I think it's an eight millimeter film of it.
[01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:12.610]  Can we show the Hindenburg blowing up, please?
[01:36:12.610 --> 01:36:14.970]  Or let me think of something else.
[01:36:14.970 --> 01:36:17.770]  Maybe show a Las Vegas hotel being demolished.
[01:36:17.770 --> 01:36:18.770]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:36:18.770 --> 01:36:19.770]  That'll be easier.
[01:36:19.770 --> 01:36:27.570]  Pull up a Las Vegas hotel being demolished, a Las Vegas casino being demolished.
[01:36:27.570 --> 01:36:30.090]  Or the World Trade Center is blowing up and collapsing.
[01:36:30.090 --> 01:36:34.770]  And call that a warning shot.
[01:36:34.770 --> 01:36:38.410]  This is not a warning shot.
[01:36:38.410 --> 01:36:42.570]  Now to understand this story, the average right wing foxhose would say, oh, look at
[01:36:42.570 --> 01:36:43.570]  China.
[01:36:43.570 --> 01:36:44.810]  The evil communists are so terrible.
[01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:50.170]  They're cutting off the two rare earth elements that are needed in all microprocessors, all
[01:36:50.170 --> 01:36:51.730]  microchips.
[01:36:51.730 --> 01:36:52.730]  This is terrible.
[01:36:52.730 --> 01:36:53.730]  There are enemies.
[01:36:53.730 --> 01:36:54.730]  Oh, they found the Hindenburg.
[01:36:54.730 --> 01:36:56.650]  Here, just show it to everybody, please.
[01:36:56.650 --> 01:36:57.650]  This is a warning shot.
[01:36:57.650 --> 01:36:58.650]  You're seeing the Hindenburg.
[01:36:58.730 --> 01:37:01.130]  No, that's not a warning shot right there.
[01:37:01.130 --> 01:37:05.930]  That's a hydrogen dirigible blowing up and burning the ground in like 10 seconds.
[01:37:05.930 --> 01:37:07.850]  Yeah, let's take the lower third off.
[01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:09.810]  Let's show it full screen for everybody, please.
[01:37:09.810 --> 01:37:10.970]  So that's not a warning shot.
[01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:13.210]  That's total collapse.
[01:37:13.210 --> 01:37:17.370]  Now I'm not saying this is total collapse yet.
[01:37:17.370 --> 01:37:26.890]  But in a week or two, if they continue this blockage of these rare earth minerals, it
[01:37:26.890 --> 01:37:28.930]  will be the Hindenburg.
[01:37:28.930 --> 01:37:31.090]  Great job, guys, finding that.
[01:37:31.090 --> 01:37:36.010]  Now let's show a Las Vegas casino demolition.
[01:37:36.010 --> 01:37:37.730]  Not a warning shot, not a flesh wound.
[01:37:37.730 --> 01:37:39.530]  It's like Monty Python, the Holy Grail.
[01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:40.730]  He cuts his arms and legs off.
[01:37:40.730 --> 01:37:41.730]  He's hot.
[01:37:41.730 --> 01:37:42.730]  It's just a flesh wound.
[01:37:42.730 --> 01:37:49.010]  Now, the reason I point this is so bad is, do you think the Chi-Coms, the CIA put in
[01:37:49.010 --> 01:37:53.970]  power in 1947, only had about control of half the country, 90 plus percent of the country
[01:37:53.970 --> 01:37:54.970]  did not have electricity?
[01:37:55.050 --> 01:38:00.770]  90 plus percent of the country did not have running water or sewage.
[01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:05.410]  And then by the year 2010, they basically run the world.
[01:38:05.410 --> 01:38:07.690]  Do you think they just died and woke?
[01:38:07.690 --> 01:38:08.690]  No.
[01:38:08.690 --> 01:38:19.250]  I mean, how do you give one country 98, type it in, they admit this, China has 98 percent
[01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:29.810]  control of all of the rare earth metals and systems and elements to make microchips.
[01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:35.130]  Now, do you know how much work it took for the corporate banks and the New World Order
[01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:42.330]  that finance everything to make sure communist China had total absolute control over the
[01:38:42.330 --> 01:38:46.050]  minerals that are needed for all microchips when the whole world's based on it?
[01:38:46.050 --> 01:38:47.530]  Do you know how hard that was?
[01:38:47.530 --> 01:38:49.730]  There were thousands of companies tried to get it.
[01:38:49.730 --> 01:38:52.410]  The U.S. dominated it 40 years ago.
[01:38:52.410 --> 01:38:53.930]  England was a big player.
[01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:55.290]  So was Australia.
[01:38:55.290 --> 01:39:00.210]  They used lawyers and law firms and government harassment.
[01:39:00.210 --> 01:39:03.850]  You know, we got diamond mines all over the U.S. and Canada, right?
[01:39:03.850 --> 01:39:07.450]  Not as much as South Africa, but we've got, you know, 30 percent the diamonds they've
[01:39:07.450 --> 01:39:08.450]  got.
[01:39:08.450 --> 01:39:12.250]  They don't let you have a diamond mine in Arkansas.
[01:39:12.250 --> 01:39:18.010]  Arkansas is sitting on top, gigantic, massive tonnage of pure diamonds.
[01:39:18.010 --> 01:39:19.010]  You're not allowed to have it.
[01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:20.570]  So, again, I'm going to explain this to you real quick.
[01:39:20.570 --> 01:39:25.130]  Remember, Bill Clinton killed that deal for the DeBoer family.
[01:39:25.130 --> 01:39:28.810]  Not the DeBeer family, the DeBoer family.
[01:39:28.810 --> 01:39:35.690]  So when you pull back and you look at all of this, you understand that China was given
[01:39:35.690 --> 01:39:42.490]  full control of the rarest minerals of the planet, 98 percent.
[01:39:42.490 --> 01:39:45.970]  And so now, show the footage of Janet Yellen, the former head of the private Federal Reserve,
[01:39:45.970 --> 01:39:50.210]  now the Treasury Secretary, going to China and bowing down to the second command and
[01:39:50.210 --> 01:39:56.170]  literally bowing multiple times and pissing herself while she grovels to him.
[01:39:56.170 --> 01:39:57.490]  Because that's their people.
[01:39:57.490 --> 01:40:01.210]  And the Chinese have, of course, said, screw you, we're in control, F you, we don't take
[01:40:01.210 --> 01:40:02.210]  orders anymore.
[01:40:02.210 --> 01:40:04.570]  And they're still there taking orders.
[01:40:04.570 --> 01:40:10.930]  So the globalists, all these Ivy League, Harvard scumbags, put China in charge, killed their
[01:40:10.930 --> 01:40:17.130]  political dissidents, sold us out, trained the Chinese how to be evil and oppress people.
[01:40:17.130 --> 01:40:22.890]  And now the Chinese have double-crossed them and have now cut off the rarest minerals to
[01:40:22.890 --> 01:40:27.090]  the United States.
[01:40:27.090 --> 01:40:36.050]  Disgusting.
[01:40:36.050 --> 01:40:40.290]  So that's where we are in the year 20, 23.
[01:40:40.290 --> 01:40:42.370]  Here's the good news.
[01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:45.730]  Hundreds of microchips in their car during the lockdowns.
[01:40:45.730 --> 01:40:49.090]  A lot of cars said, oh, we're going to go back to electric locks, not digital.
[01:40:49.090 --> 01:40:50.090]  Great.
[01:40:50.090 --> 01:40:51.090]  All this digital controls you.
[01:40:51.090 --> 01:40:52.330]  It's all hooked into AI.
[01:40:52.330 --> 01:40:55.850]  You don't want a robot to wipe your butt.
[01:40:55.850 --> 01:41:00.130]  You don't want everything watching what you're doing and integrating it and popping up orders
[01:41:00.130 --> 01:41:03.490]  constantly at you.
[01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:10.610]  And if U.S. regulators left us alone, we wouldn't go from the third energy producer, number one
[01:41:10.610 --> 01:41:12.490]  in one year, like Trump did.
[01:41:12.490 --> 01:41:15.650]  We would become the rarest mineral kings within years.
[01:41:15.650 --> 01:41:20.370]  The United States and Canada are full of it, baby.
[01:41:20.370 --> 01:41:25.170]  South America's full of it.
[01:41:25.170 --> 01:41:32.450]  China is just exploiting Africa and Afghanistan and Australia right now.
[01:41:32.450 --> 01:41:34.970]  That's why Australia talks about fighting China constantly.
[01:41:34.970 --> 01:41:35.970]  That's a cover.
[01:41:35.970 --> 01:41:36.970]  Australia's run by China.
[01:41:36.970 --> 01:41:42.050]  Oh, we have to have a nuclear sub to fight the Chinese.
[01:41:42.050 --> 01:41:45.130]  The Chinese already took over all the state-run mines.
[01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:49.570]  The British crown 10 years ago already sold out to the Chaikoms.
[01:41:49.570 --> 01:41:54.330]  Australia is Chaikom held on record.
[01:41:54.330 --> 01:42:03.530]  And so, two days ago, what happens, overhead shot please, Wall Street Journal, China controls
[01:42:03.530 --> 01:42:07.970]  minerals that run the world and it just fired a warning shot.
[01:42:07.970 --> 01:42:16.570]  No more export of gallium and geranium, which you need for all microchips.
[01:42:16.570 --> 01:42:19.770]  And the Arnold's like, well, at least they didn't ban the others.
[01:42:19.770 --> 01:42:22.690]  But you have to have those.
[01:42:22.690 --> 01:42:25.170]  You have to have those.
[01:42:25.170 --> 01:42:27.490]  You have to have them.
[01:42:27.490 --> 01:42:29.570]  You have to have those.
[01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:36.770]  So the Chinese communists can't find their ass with both hands.
[01:42:36.770 --> 01:42:38.770]  The Chinese government's collapsing.
[01:42:38.770 --> 01:42:40.770]  Their people, half of them are starving.
[01:42:40.770 --> 01:42:42.690]  They got giant slave camps everywhere.
[01:42:42.690 --> 01:42:44.730]  They got a universal credit score.
[01:42:44.730 --> 01:42:46.530]  They've got social credit scores.
[01:42:46.530 --> 01:42:49.490]  They've got scanners and hell on earth.
[01:42:49.490 --> 01:42:51.210]  We love the Chinese people.
[01:42:51.210 --> 01:42:56.210]  And meanwhile, the criminals that were the middlemen Trump talked about that sold China
[01:42:56.210 --> 01:42:58.810]  out and sold us out to screw each other.
[01:42:58.810 --> 01:43:07.410]  It's like in that famous James Bond second movie, pull it up, Siamese fighting fish seen
[01:43:07.410 --> 01:43:11.290]  from Russia with love, get it for me.
[01:43:11.290 --> 01:43:17.610]  And Blofeld, the head of Spectre, which is real, former deputy head of OSS in my six wrote
[01:43:17.610 --> 01:43:21.170]  the books based on reality where they want to depopulate the earth and world government
[01:43:21.170 --> 01:43:26.450]  and release a bioweapon to kill you and Boone Raker, all that America influence telling you
[01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:29.210]  you have Blofeld calling in his people.
[01:43:29.210 --> 01:43:30.450]  One's a Russian.
[01:43:30.450 --> 01:43:31.450]  One works for the British.
[01:43:31.450 --> 01:43:32.450]  One for America.
[01:43:32.450 --> 01:43:38.570]  And he says, I want you to get the Russians and Americans killing each other.
[01:43:38.570 --> 01:43:44.010]  I don't understand, sir, as if they would understand an elementary system like that.
[01:43:44.010 --> 01:43:46.250]  But it's to an idiot Hollywood audience.
[01:43:46.250 --> 01:43:48.050]  So they're like talking to you like a five year old.
[01:43:48.050 --> 01:43:54.370]  The Siamese fighting fish are incredible creatures, strong, but stupid.
[01:43:54.370 --> 01:43:55.370]  Something like that.
[01:43:55.370 --> 01:43:56.370]  We'll play it in a minute.
[01:43:56.370 --> 01:44:00.530]  Notice this, the fight and one kills the other, but is now weak.
[01:44:00.530 --> 01:44:04.090]  And then Spectre comes in to take over.
[01:44:04.090 --> 01:44:07.610]  And that's all this is.
[01:44:07.610 --> 01:44:11.810]  You look at the carnage for America and Russia and Ukraine, you go, why are these?
[01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:15.210]  Because the Spectre is real.
[01:44:15.210 --> 01:44:18.690]  The New World Order is real.
[01:44:18.690 --> 01:44:33.450]  And in the real world, Ethan Hunt is not a nice person like Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible.
[01:44:33.450 --> 01:44:41.290]  Ethan Hunt is E. Howard Hunt, who fought in China in World War Two and who assassinated
[01:44:41.290 --> 01:44:45.490]  John F. Kennedy and who gave us the deathbed confession.
[01:44:45.490 --> 01:44:50.810]  And that's all true.
[01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:51.810]  He had the clip ready.
[01:44:51.810 --> 01:44:52.810]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:44:52.810 --> 01:44:53.810]  Thank you.
[01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:54.810]  Siamese fighting fish.
[01:44:54.810 --> 01:44:55.810]  Fascinating creatures.
[01:44:55.810 --> 01:44:56.810]  Brave, but on the whole, stupid.
[01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:57.810]  Yes, they're stupid.
[01:44:57.810 --> 01:45:16.890]  Except for the occasional one, such as we have here, who lets the other two fight.
[01:45:16.890 --> 01:45:23.610]  And he waits.
[01:45:23.610 --> 01:45:29.490]  Waits until the survivor is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself.
[01:45:29.490 --> 01:45:34.890]  And then, like Spectre, he strikes.
[01:45:34.890 --> 01:45:37.370]  I find the parallel amusing.
[01:45:37.370 --> 01:45:42.890]  Our organization did not arrange for you to come over from the Russians just for amusement,
[01:45:42.890 --> 01:45:47.010]  number three.
[01:45:47.010 --> 01:45:48.850]  Come in, Gronstein.
[01:45:48.850 --> 01:45:53.570]  Sit down, number three, while we listen to what number five has devised for us.
[01:45:53.570 --> 01:45:58.330]  I hope Gronstein's efforts as director of planning will continue to be as successful
[01:45:58.330 --> 01:45:59.330]  as his chess.
[01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:01.050]  They will be.
[01:46:01.050 --> 01:46:05.970]  According to your instructions, I've planned for Spectre to steal from the Russians their
[01:46:05.970 --> 01:46:08.490]  new lector decoding machine.
[01:46:08.490 --> 01:46:12.010]  For this, we need the services of a female member of the Russian cryptograph section
[01:46:12.010 --> 01:46:17.010]  in Turkey and the help of the British secret service.
[01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:22.330]  Naturally, neither the Russians nor the British will be aware that they are now working for
[01:46:22.330 --> 01:46:23.330]  us.
[01:46:23.330 --> 01:46:26.410]  Number three, is your section ready to carry out Gronstein's directives?
[01:46:26.410 --> 01:46:27.410]  Yes, number one.
[01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:31.050]  The operation will be organized according to Gronstein's plan.
[01:46:31.050 --> 01:46:35.010]  I have selected a suitable girl from the Russian consulate in Istanbul.
[01:46:35.010 --> 01:46:40.330]  She's capable, cooperative, and her loyalty to the state is beyond question.
[01:46:40.330 --> 01:46:45.530]  And you're absolutely sure she believes you're still head of operations for Soviet intelligence?
[01:46:45.530 --> 01:46:48.890]  It is most unlikely she would know I'm now working for Spectre.
[01:46:48.890 --> 01:46:53.410]  Moscow has kept my defection secret from everyone but a few members of the Presidium.
[01:46:53.410 --> 01:46:55.850]  For your sake, I hope so.
[01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:59.450]  Gronstein, you're sure this plan is foolproof?
[01:46:59.450 --> 01:47:01.290]  Yes, it is.
[01:47:01.290 --> 01:47:05.810]  Because I have anticipated every possible variation of counter move.
[01:47:05.810 --> 01:47:10.290]  But what makes you think that M, the head of British intelligence, will oblige you by
[01:47:10.290 --> 01:47:12.290]  falling in with your plan?
[01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:15.410]  For the simple reason that this is so obviously a trap.
[01:47:15.410 --> 01:47:20.290]  My reading of the British mentality is that they always treat a trap as a challenge.
[01:47:20.290 --> 01:47:24.370]  In any case, they couldn't possibly pass up even the slightest chance of getting their
[01:47:24.370 --> 01:47:27.450]  hands on the electro-decoder.
[01:47:27.450 --> 01:47:30.730]  They have wanted one for years.
[01:47:30.730 --> 01:47:32.570]  All that you say could be true.
[01:47:32.570 --> 01:47:33.570]  What else?
[01:47:33.570 --> 01:47:37.210]  As an added refinement, I think that Spectre will probably have the chance of a personal
[01:47:37.210 --> 01:47:41.250]  revenge for the killing of our operative, Doctor No.
[01:47:41.250 --> 01:47:45.370]  Because the men the British will almost certainly use on a mission of this sort would
[01:47:45.370 --> 01:47:48.810]  be their agent, James Bond.
[01:47:48.810 --> 01:47:53.570]  Let his death be a particularly unpleasant and humiliating one.
[01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:54.570]  Good.
[01:47:54.570 --> 01:47:58.370]  I shall put my plan into operation straight away.
[01:47:58.370 --> 01:48:01.410]  And there will be no failure.
[01:48:01.410 --> 01:48:03.410]  All right.
[01:48:03.410 --> 01:48:05.050]  So we've had a good show tonight.
[01:48:05.050 --> 01:48:06.690]  Owen Shore is about to take over.
[01:48:06.690 --> 01:48:08.970]  We got 10 minutes left.
[01:48:08.970 --> 01:48:11.810]  But I really got prepared today and I didn't cover much of it.
[01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:12.810]  That's okay.
[01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:15.250]  Because Tim Cook's gay and he runs death camps.
[01:48:15.250 --> 01:48:16.250]  It's like, well, he's gay, though.
[01:48:16.250 --> 01:48:17.250]  He runs death camps.
[01:48:17.250 --> 01:48:18.250]  It's like, it's trendy.
[01:48:18.250 --> 01:48:19.250]  And like, we're in a nuclear war.
[01:48:19.250 --> 01:48:21.650]  And it's like, well, Biden's, you know, trendy and so's Obama.
[01:48:21.650 --> 01:48:23.450]  So it's all right.
[01:48:23.450 --> 01:48:24.450]  It's okay.
[01:48:24.450 --> 01:48:27.290]  I'm like, you know, CNN.
[01:48:27.290 --> 01:48:31.970]  How dare they make a movie about a true story with 6,000 saved children and hundreds of
[01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:34.730]  convictions and something good the feds did.
[01:48:34.730 --> 01:48:35.730]  No, it doesn't exist.
[01:48:35.730 --> 01:48:40.690]  I mean, it's just it's it's it's so preposterous.
[01:48:40.690 --> 01:48:42.850]  But it really makes sense.
[01:48:42.850 --> 01:48:47.050]  Normal people are off doing business and playing golf and taking their kids to soccer practice
[01:48:47.050 --> 01:48:51.610]  and just living our lives while the most deviant, crazy people have gotten control and they've
[01:48:51.610 --> 01:48:58.450]  gotten the media that will sit there and push the most evil, deceptive crap the world has
[01:48:58.450 --> 01:49:01.130]  ever seen.
[01:49:01.130 --> 01:49:10.010]  But as of Sunday night, July 9, 2023, two rare earth minerals that you must have in
[01:49:10.010 --> 01:49:28.810]  all microchip production, gallium and germanium are totally banned for export to any companies
[01:49:28.810 --> 01:49:32.970]  doing business in the United States.
[01:49:32.970 --> 01:49:36.010]  And I understand, folks, most of you aren't into microchip production.
[01:49:36.010 --> 01:49:37.010]  You don't really care.
[01:49:37.010 --> 01:49:40.050]  So the average person, I go, the stock market is going to have problems.
[01:49:40.050 --> 01:49:41.050]  I'm on the stock market.
[01:49:41.050 --> 01:49:42.050]  Why do I care?
[01:49:42.050 --> 01:49:45.690]  Because the whole thing runs off this fraud and I'm not for the fraud.
[01:49:45.690 --> 01:49:48.090]  I'm just telling you, you turn it off.
[01:49:48.090 --> 01:49:51.290]  You're like, I don't want this big edifice of the new order.
[01:49:51.290 --> 01:49:57.610]  The problem is when it falls, it crushes us.
[01:49:58.610 --> 01:50:00.610]  Here's the deal.
[01:50:00.610 --> 01:50:02.690]  We don't think of salt as a big deal.
[01:50:02.690 --> 01:50:06.250]  If you don't get salt for about a week or so, you'll have a heart attack and die.
[01:50:06.250 --> 01:50:10.730]  I don't care if you're eight years old and in perfect shape or 50 years old.
[01:50:10.730 --> 01:50:11.730]  Same thing.
[01:50:11.730 --> 01:50:12.730]  Water.
[01:50:12.730 --> 01:50:13.730]  You don't get water for five, six days.
[01:50:13.730 --> 01:50:14.730]  You're going to die.
[01:50:14.730 --> 01:50:15.730]  You don't get food for 30 days.
[01:50:15.730 --> 01:50:16.730]  You're going to die.
[01:50:16.730 --> 01:50:17.730]  You don't get oxygen for four minutes.
[01:50:17.730 --> 01:50:18.730]  You're going to die.
[01:50:18.730 --> 01:50:21.650]  It's all how long does it take before you die?
[01:50:21.650 --> 01:50:29.250]  And so China just, the CCP just pulled the plug on the new world order and everything.
[01:50:29.250 --> 01:50:30.690]  And I'm sure the globalists are happy.
[01:50:30.690 --> 01:50:32.410]  They want things to come to a standstill.
[01:50:32.410 --> 01:50:34.490]  They're the ones that told the Chinese to do it.
[01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:37.090]  They're the ones that gave them the power to do this.
[01:50:37.090 --> 01:50:39.970]  I mean, national security, they fetishize it.
[01:50:39.970 --> 01:50:42.450]  Oh, the NSA has to spy on you.
[01:50:42.450 --> 01:50:47.410]  We've got to know what you're doing to keep you safe because of adversaries.
[01:50:47.410 --> 01:50:57.130]  Our ruling Harvard scumbag class gave China 98% rare earth mineral control of the planet
[01:50:57.130 --> 01:50:59.890]  for every damn machine on earth.
[01:50:59.890 --> 01:51:02.410]  And now they just implemented control.
[01:51:02.410 --> 01:51:06.450]  They don't need to stop export of all the other stuff because if you don't have those
[01:51:06.450 --> 01:51:11.690]  final ingredients, it's like saying, well, mom's making a five course dinner.
[01:51:11.690 --> 01:51:12.690]  We got potatoes.
[01:51:12.690 --> 01:51:13.690]  We got tomatoes.
[01:51:13.690 --> 01:51:15.450]  We got green beans.
[01:51:15.450 --> 01:51:16.850]  We got, we got all sorts.
[01:51:16.850 --> 01:51:18.330]  We got, we got cabbage.
[01:51:18.330 --> 01:51:23.890]  We don't have the T-bone steak.
[01:51:23.890 --> 01:51:28.170]  There is no main course.
[01:51:28.170 --> 01:51:29.570]  And I love the Wall Street Journal.
[01:51:29.570 --> 01:51:30.570]  It's so perfect.
[01:51:30.570 --> 01:51:32.250]  You can see the CIA was involved.
[01:51:32.250 --> 01:51:33.250]  Total CIA run.
[01:51:33.250 --> 01:51:35.290]  They're like, we don't look too weak here.
[01:51:35.290 --> 01:51:38.290]  Don't, don't say, don't say it'll cut us off with the juggler.
[01:51:38.290 --> 01:51:40.650]  This is a, this is a huge us place about China.
[01:51:40.650 --> 01:51:47.490]  Let's say, um, it's a warning shot.
[01:51:47.490 --> 01:51:52.810]  Let's show Kennedy, show the Zuberator film right now, please.
[01:51:52.810 --> 01:51:53.810]  Show the Zuberator film.
[01:51:53.810 --> 01:51:54.810]  Pull it up.
[01:51:54.810 --> 01:51:59.010]  Is the Zuberator film a warning shot?
[01:51:59.010 --> 01:52:00.010]  Now I'll explain.
[01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:02.930]  The way this works is they've not fired the shot.
[01:52:02.930 --> 01:52:07.010]  This announcement, and you know, the West has stockpiled all this stuff.
[01:52:07.010 --> 01:52:08.690]  They're going to act like China's got control.
[01:52:08.690 --> 01:52:12.370]  They wouldn't give the Chai Khans control of this for 10 seconds.
[01:52:12.370 --> 01:52:16.250]  Those military bases and compounds are full of this crap.
[01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:21.490]  The point is they're going to play this out though, like China's got us by the short hairs.
[01:52:21.490 --> 01:52:28.250]  So when you got that footage, roll it.
[01:52:28.250 --> 01:52:30.370]  But that's where they are.
[01:52:30.370 --> 01:52:32.530]  And that's how they operate.
[01:52:32.530 --> 01:52:35.610]  And that's how they've positioned us.
[01:52:35.610 --> 01:52:42.490]  A communist dictatorship with millions of death camps has 98% control of everything
[01:52:42.490 --> 01:52:44.850]  that makes everything possible now.
[01:52:44.850 --> 01:52:49.730]  What a horrible government, what a horrible CIA, what a horrible defense intelligence agency,
[01:52:49.730 --> 01:52:55.610]  what a horrible government supposedly protecting us and corporate America and Wall Street.
[01:52:55.610 --> 01:53:01.610]  How the hell could the Chinese that didn't have running water 65 years ago end up with
[01:53:01.610 --> 01:53:04.970]  full control all of this if you didn't hand it to them?
[01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:06.730]  And it turns out we've studied it.
[01:53:06.730 --> 01:53:07.770]  You did.
[01:53:07.770 --> 01:53:11.690]  This government hates America.
[01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:17.010]  This government doesn't want the world looking out.
[01:53:17.010 --> 01:53:18.010]  What was the clip I asked for?
[01:53:18.010 --> 01:53:19.010]  I forget now.
[01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:22.090]  What was it guys?
[01:53:22.090 --> 01:53:23.090]  There it is.
[01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:24.090]  Yeah.
[01:53:24.090 --> 01:53:27.450]  Is this a, is this a warning shot?
[01:53:27.450 --> 01:53:29.090]  Is this a shot across the bow?
[01:53:29.090 --> 01:53:30.330]  Let me see.
[01:53:30.330 --> 01:53:35.130]  Because if they continue cutting us off, take the lower third off, please.
[01:53:35.130 --> 01:53:36.130]  Let's rewind that.
[01:53:36.130 --> 01:53:37.330]  Let's play it again.
[01:53:37.330 --> 01:53:39.410]  Is that a, back it up 20 seconds.
[01:53:39.410 --> 01:53:41.810]  Is this a warning shot?
[01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:42.810]  Let me see.
[01:53:42.810 --> 01:53:46.930]  Because right now announcing the ban on this being brought to the U.S. is just the announcement,
[01:53:46.930 --> 01:53:49.570]  the rifles on our head.
[01:53:49.570 --> 01:53:51.530]  But who drove the car down that road?
[01:53:51.530 --> 01:53:53.130]  Who brought him on that route?
[01:53:53.130 --> 01:53:55.890]  Who got us in this position?
[01:53:55.890 --> 01:53:59.170]  This government hates America.
[01:53:59.170 --> 01:54:04.890]  For 70 years, they've been recruiting people, including 30,000 Nazis in Operation Paperclip
[01:54:04.890 --> 01:54:10.570]  to come here that hate this country.
[01:54:10.570 --> 01:54:14.650]  It created the wealth, the prosperity, everything because it was freer than other countries.
[01:54:14.650 --> 01:54:16.490]  But then the globalists don't like freedom.
[01:54:16.490 --> 01:54:21.330]  But if they can suck the energy out of freedom, and if they can build their new thing off
[01:54:21.330 --> 01:54:24.090]  of it, they'll do it all day long.
[01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:28.890]  So they say it's a warning shot.
[01:54:28.890 --> 01:54:30.770]  It's not a warning shot.
[01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:36.290]  It's the globalists saying to what's left of the American establishment, you're going
[01:54:36.290 --> 01:54:42.450]  to roll over to the New World Order and Klaus Schwab because China works for them.
[01:54:42.450 --> 01:54:46.730]  Or we're going to cut your infrastructure completely off.
[01:54:46.730 --> 01:54:49.930]  Now again, the story isn't that China just did this.
[01:54:49.930 --> 01:54:57.330]  The story is why when America dominated the world and had full control in 1945 on, did
[01:54:57.330 --> 01:55:02.210]  we set up China in the 70s and transfer all power to them?
[01:55:02.210 --> 01:55:03.410]  That's your answer.
[01:55:03.410 --> 01:55:07.450]  It's not why does China have, why is China doing this?
[01:55:07.450 --> 01:55:10.530]  Why is China got us by the balls squeezing them?
[01:55:10.530 --> 01:55:14.530]  No, it's why did the people, well, you've seen them.
[01:55:14.530 --> 01:55:16.570]  They're anti-Christian folks.
[01:55:16.570 --> 01:55:19.190]  The West had the promise of Christianity.
[01:55:19.190 --> 01:55:21.570]  That's what they're threatened by.
[01:55:21.570 --> 01:55:24.530]  The China's godless.
[01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:27.010]  That's why they're the model.
[01:55:27.010 --> 01:55:34.690]  This is all being done to settle a satanic score against God and the fact that God rose
[01:55:34.690 --> 01:55:40.770]  America up in this fashion.
[01:55:40.770 --> 01:55:49.210]  So when you hear all about China and all about how they're in control and it's, oh, it's
[01:55:49.210 --> 01:55:50.210]  so terrible.
[01:55:50.210 --> 01:55:51.210]  They're in control.
[01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:52.210]  Oh, they're building islands.
[01:55:52.210 --> 01:55:53.210]  Oh, they're attacking.
[01:55:53.210 --> 01:55:54.210]  They're attacking Vietnam.
[01:55:54.210 --> 01:55:55.490]  Oh, they're attacking the Philippines.
[01:55:55.490 --> 01:55:57.690]  Oh, it's so terrible.
[01:55:57.690 --> 01:56:02.530]  Remember that the criminals in our government that run our Pentagon, that teach the military
[01:56:02.530 --> 01:56:09.530]  that white people are inherently evil and that two men can have a baby are inside our
[01:56:09.530 --> 01:56:14.530]  government and have been working to give all the power and control over to China because
[01:56:14.530 --> 01:56:18.030]  it's a dirty, murderous communist regime they control.
[01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:22.930]  At the same time, all the channels from CNN to ABC to CBS to the New York Times, the Washington
[01:56:22.930 --> 01:56:29.730]  Post are telling you, like the Rolling Stones said, maggot brains, men with worms in their
[01:56:29.730 --> 01:56:31.690]  brains care about kidnapped kids.
[01:56:31.690 --> 01:56:33.690]  You're like, who the hell?
[01:56:33.690 --> 01:56:34.890]  What hate from a weirdo?
[01:56:34.890 --> 01:56:39.290]  Well, you look at the guy that said it, and it tells you everything you know.
[01:56:39.290 --> 01:56:42.370]  Take one look at that guy, and you're like, that's my babysitter.
[01:56:42.370 --> 01:56:49.610]  I'm going to hire him to babysit my kids right now, and I'm also going to jump off a cliff.
[01:56:49.610 --> 01:56:51.730]  I'm out of time.
[01:56:51.730 --> 01:56:55.330]  If you should so choose to support us, that's up to you at this point.
[01:56:55.330 --> 01:56:58.370]  I've done my duty, and I love God, and I love you.

[01:57:14.810 --> 01:57:18.650]  Just worship the devil, I guess, but I'm being sarcastic.
[01:57:18.650 --> 01:57:19.930]  We need your support, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:58:49.930 --> 01:58:54.470]  I want to say BrainForce is great.
[01:58:54.470 --> 01:58:56.850]  I want to say TurboForce is amazing.
[01:58:56.850 --> 01:58:57.850]  It is.
[01:58:57.850 --> 01:59:02.330]  took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:59:02.330 --> 01:59:03.650]  The fish oil's better than it,
[01:59:03.650 --> 01:59:05.490]  and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:59:05.490 --> 01:59:09.610]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart,
[01:59:09.610 --> 01:59:11.050]  the cleanest, the best out there.
[01:59:11.050 --> 01:59:13.930]  Krill oils is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps,
[01:59:13.930 --> 01:59:15.770]  and I'm just sorry, you want something like this,
[01:59:15.770 --> 01:59:16.730]  you don't get stuff for free.
[01:59:16.730 --> 01:59:19.890]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[01:59:19.890 --> 01:59:21.190]  I'm not making a medical statement here,
[01:59:21.190 --> 01:59:22.030]  but let me tell you something,
[01:59:22.030 --> 01:59:24.890]  and I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:26.770]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:59:28.250 --> 01:59:33.250]  So, your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:59:34.250 --> 01:59:35.770]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:59:35.770 --> 01:59:37.810]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it,
[01:59:37.810 --> 01:59:38.890]  but you notice I just obsess,
[01:59:38.890 --> 01:59:40.610]  because whatever the best is we've got,
[01:59:40.610 --> 01:59:42.970]  I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.
