[00:42.520 --> 00:48.840]  worldwide broadcast and we are going to be covering obviously a lot of
[00:48.840 --> 00:53.700]  incredibly important world developments and news today on the science and

[00:59.560 --> 01:07.360]  on the economy front and a lot more today but as always we are here exposing
[01:07.360 --> 01:13.800]  the overall global elites plan for a tyrannical world government there is
[01:13.800 --> 01:18.680]  big drone news out today you can type drone into Google News any day and
[01:18.680 --> 01:22.640]  there's hundreds of articles about police departments weaponizing them and
[01:22.640 --> 01:28.000]  little mini drones the size of insects spying on people and you can type in
[01:28.000 --> 01:31.840]  armored personnel carrier and find dozens of articles every day of police
[01:31.840 --> 01:35.760]  departments getting wheeled and treaded tanks and training with the military
[01:35.760 --> 01:41.360]  preparing for civil war you can search economic collapse and find scores of
[01:41.360 --> 01:46.960]  Washington Post CNBC with the very banksters that engineered it talking
[01:46.960 --> 01:51.600]  about the imminent collapse if we don't give them total control and world
[01:51.600 --> 01:55.720]  government meanwhile you're an evil conspiracy theorist if you talk about
[01:55.720 --> 02:02.040]  world government we're going to be covering it all today but we have two
[02:02.040 --> 02:07.560]  ultra bizarro reports but they're ultra bizarro if you're a normal person
[02:07.560 --> 02:13.000]  they're not ultra bizarro if you understand that it's meant to be crazy
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.560]  it's meant to be over the top that is the program that is the idea that is the
[02:18.560 --> 02:25.920]  system new TSA policy ordering travelers to freeze on command this is
[02:25.920 --> 02:33.280]  prisoner training this is police training perps but we're not three time
[02:33.280 --> 02:38.680]  losers in a federal or state penitentiary people that have been in the
[02:38.680 --> 02:43.160]  juvenile justice system and in the adult system you can tell how they dress how
[02:43.160 --> 02:47.760]  they act you can say things to them and tell and in fact police are trained how
[02:47.760 --> 02:52.600]  to do this just automatically how they behave well this is taking 90 plus
[02:52.600 --> 02:56.360]  percent of the population who historically across cultural lines
[02:56.360 --> 03:01.920]  throughout history is completely law abiding in fact we'll walk into pits and
[03:01.920 --> 03:07.160]  be shot in the back of the head throughout the last hundred years in
[03:07.160 --> 03:11.440]  every culture villages get captured they march one line of people in and shoot
[03:11.440 --> 03:15.040]  them they tell them the next line March in they they'll march in with their
[03:15.040 --> 03:20.360]  children they will follow the authority because it's wearing a uniform but this
[03:20.360 --> 03:27.160]  is just the criminal state now in a preparatory phase to get everybody
[03:27.160 --> 03:31.120]  accustomed to the two people in uniforms yelling at you and putting their
[03:31.120 --> 03:37.200]  hands on you and the TSA is the brown shirt cadres that are now not going to
[03:37.200 --> 03:43.920]  expand we were correct are now expanding everywhere 80 hours of training two
[03:43.920 --> 03:49.920]  weeks if you are a felon that's a plus they do the background check but then
[03:49.920 --> 03:53.040]  just put the fact that you're felon in the file and you go right to the top
[03:53.040 --> 03:59.960]  defrocked priests convicted pedophile armed robber right to the top you are

[07:12.000 --> 07:15.120]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[07:15.120 --> 07:19.080]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science

[08:11.640 --> 08:19.160]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[08:19.160 --> 08:28.240]  Texas Alex Jones all right my friends things are moving very quickly here I'm
[08:28.240 --> 08:36.080]  going to be broadcasting today in to the fourth hour for years I did a three hour
[08:36.080 --> 08:40.840]  radio broadcast and then about five six years ago I started a four hour when I
[08:40.840 --> 08:46.400]  started info wars nightly news I cut the show back to its original three 11 to
[08:46.400 --> 08:53.520]  two central noon to three eastern instead of noon to four eastern but some
[08:53.520 --> 08:58.920]  days because some stations still just carry the fourth hour and re-errant we
[08:58.920 --> 09:03.800]  are gonna go with the entire fourth hour today simply because there's too much
[09:03.800 --> 09:11.600]  news to cover also one of our sources and I'm gonna give it to you once our big
[09:11.600 --> 09:17.000]  report comes out and get this gentleman on the show tonight who's broken a lot
[09:17.000 --> 09:22.400]  of national news I'll just leave it at that ferreting through leaked but also
[09:22.400 --> 09:27.600]  declassified current army field manuals
[09:27.840 --> 09:34.880]  discovered a document dealing with pulling triggers and killing US citizens
[09:34.880 --> 09:42.480]  and of course we saw the army times back four years ago when they set up brigade
[09:42.480 --> 09:46.760]  homeland or three and a half years ago they had a colonel in there quoted as
[09:46.760 --> 09:50.120]  yeah we'll be out with the jaws of life helping you with car wrecks but we'll
[09:50.120 --> 09:56.800]  also be for civil unrest and things and yeah pulling triggers it's our new role
[09:56.800 --> 10:00.560]  and then the army times edited his quote out a day later because it made
[10:00.560 --> 10:05.320]  such a firestorm you've seen a secretary of the army announced that they're
[10:05.320 --> 10:09.800]  gonna have brigades in every major city 4,000 plus people you've got drills
[10:09.800 --> 10:17.000]  everywhere with real army checkpoints on highways from Tennessee to California
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.600]  Marines with sidearms with 9 millimeter barrettas searching vehicles randomly in
[10:23.600 --> 10:27.720]  the middle of California this is happening and it's all just to get you
[10:27.720 --> 10:31.520]  ready you notice they're suddenly announcing literally hundreds of
[10:31.520 --> 10:35.520]  articles a day like it's more than that some days oh yeah there's all sorts of
[10:35.520 --> 10:39.600]  little tiny drones big drones weaponized drones face scanning you every
[10:39.600 --> 10:41.920]  neighborhood's gonna have one basically flying above it because they're so
[10:41.920 --> 10:47.720]  inexpensive all the tech has got cheap enough now to just roll this out against
[10:47.720 --> 10:54.360]  society so it is it is happening right now my friends
[10:54.360 --> 11:03.720]  so we're going to be going over all of that today this report will be out in
[11:03.720 --> 11:11.600]  the next hour or so and of course we're also going to link to the document
[11:11.600 --> 11:20.360]  itself but I've noticed if I come out with an incredible piece of news like
[11:20.360 --> 11:26.000]  this like the army field manuals for civilian inmate labor camps and
[11:26.000 --> 11:33.720]  reeducation of political dissidents two months ago and a week into it a week
[11:33.720 --> 11:36.920]  into it the army responded and said yeah that's our document and it's
[11:36.920 --> 11:41.360]  classified and you shouldn't have it time alike four years ago nobody believed
[11:41.360 --> 11:44.560]  the Mayak and Homeland Security reports we got which we've gotten reports
[11:44.560 --> 11:48.040]  before like that but no one would ever pay attention to them with the FBI's
[11:48.040 --> 11:54.240]  phone numbers on them confirmed real back in 99 but it made big national news
[11:54.240 --> 11:58.120]  about a week after we broke it and in Ron Paul's office was even called they
[11:58.120 --> 12:02.000]  said well you know we know Alex Jones we're not saying it's not credible but
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.320]  we've got a you know we don't think this is real come on they're not saying you're
[12:05.320 --> 12:10.120]  a terror so we have a Ron Paul sticker but that's because a lot of the people
[12:10.120 --> 12:14.400]  working for Ron Paul aren't Ron Paul he knows that stuff's real but a lot of his
[12:14.400 --> 12:19.000]  staff are younger kind of mainline Republicans who were very naive and so
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.920]  they're like oh there's no way you're a terrorist if you got a Ron Paul sticker
[12:21.920 --> 12:28.280]  no no no I mean nothing against mr. Jones but we just that can't be true well
[12:28.280 --> 12:36.360]  it was true wasn't it yes it was I wish none of this was true but now it's
[12:36.360 --> 12:41.800]  gotten in your face so obvious that world government every week is again in
[12:41.800 --> 12:48.280]  hundreds of publications everywhere that it's the solution to all our problems
[12:48.280 --> 12:52.480]  and guess what we were right again international mega banks that issue the
[12:52.480 --> 12:56.560]  currency and credit out of nothing they're the ones that run it oh and they
[12:56.560 --> 13:00.480]  want to turn off your resources that's what's gonna fix the economy they go on
[13:00.480 --> 13:07.240]  and say that too but I'm still a conspiracy theorist you know why because
[13:07.240 --> 13:11.160]  people are scared deep down and they know this is real so they say oh no no
[13:11.160 --> 13:15.000]  no no that can't be true you know the first stages any doctor will tell you
[13:15.000 --> 13:20.120]  this when somebody goes in and gets diagnosed with a revocable heart
[13:20.120 --> 13:23.840]  problems it's only a matter of time until the person is gonna die the people
[13:23.840 --> 13:29.880]  get into denial or if somebody has a type of cancer that's incurable inoperable
[13:29.880 --> 13:34.360]  people generally are in denial they say that's not true they'll get a second
[13:34.360 --> 13:37.080]  opinion which is always good to do sometimes the doctors are wrong but
[13:37.080 --> 13:40.480]  generally they're right and then a few months later you start getting really
[13:40.480 --> 13:44.720]  sick and you're like wow this is real I'm going blind now this brain tumor is
[13:44.720 --> 13:51.280]  killing me and then you get ready you get ready for it so I'm gonna try to
[13:51.280 --> 13:55.400]  explain to you again America and the rest of the world we have a very bad
[13:55.400 --> 14:00.080]  form of cancer and it is going to be terminal for many of us it's called
[14:00.080 --> 14:07.680]  total scientific organized evil and it doesn't play games killing is its
[14:07.680 --> 14:10.840]  business and business is good
[14:12.360 --> 14:19.880]  surprise you're dead surprise nuclear war surprise bio weapons released you're
[14:19.880 --> 14:25.200]  there watching your family die as you flop around vomiting surprise drones
[14:25.200 --> 14:30.760]  fly over your city and spray nerve gas on you surprise surprise the New World
[14:30.760 --> 14:34.840]  Order eugenicists that funded Hitler linen and Stalin and Mao who've been
[14:34.840 --> 14:39.360]  digging underground bases all over the world for at least 70 years in stock
[14:39.360 --> 14:49.360]  piling super technology and weapons aren't doing it to play games they want
[14:49.360 --> 14:53.200]  the whole world and they want it now and they're gonna salt the earth and then
[14:53.200 --> 14:58.960]  come back and re-engineer the planet in their own words and this is the nature
[14:58.960 --> 15:04.680]  of the special transmission today this the broadcast is four hours long today
[15:04.680 --> 15:16.360]  normally three and why is it four hours long today the broadcast is four hours
[15:16.360 --> 15:22.200]  long because for three weeks we've been working on this piece that is so
[15:22.200 --> 15:28.400]  important I can't even think of a name for it I don't even know what to call
[15:28.400 --> 15:32.400]  it and Aaron once he got he can usually turn one of these projects around in
[15:32.400 --> 15:36.800]  three four days one of these special news reports with videos and documents and
[15:36.800 --> 15:40.720]  the music and everything it's taking almost three weeks because he's he
[15:40.720 --> 15:45.320]  recognized he said well this is just too important a material too important of
[15:45.320 --> 15:53.240]  information and we think it's going to be ready by 2 30 central today and then
[15:53.240 --> 15:58.360]  we'll try to air it there and skip that last break and try to air it then if
[15:58.360 --> 16:02.480]  not it will be on the night we notice tonight but he's about to export it and
[16:02.480 --> 16:11.640]  it's 20 minutes long and if the export doesn't fail then we'll have it for you
[16:11.640 --> 16:22.320]  okay it has to do with the skulls I had in here two three weeks ago so that is
[16:22.320 --> 16:32.200]  coming up today now again Paul Watson is on this right now and by the start of
[16:32.200 --> 16:36.640]  the next hour I will be able to direct you to nfalwars.com and
[16:36.640 --> 16:41.480]  prisonplanet.com and to the source of this information as well but I want to
[16:41.480 --> 16:45.960]  I want to launch it I want to build it up because it needs to be built up and
[16:45.960 --> 16:50.960]  because again I don't build things up because it's hype I've noticed if
[16:50.960 --> 16:55.560]  something's really important and I just sit here hammering absolutely key intel
[16:55.560 --> 17:01.080]  at you people tend to just not even appreciate it here's an example we have
[17:01.080 --> 17:07.080]  $15,000 in prizes for the Obama dictator poster contest and I said I'm gonna try
[17:07.080 --> 17:10.600]  something new I said you've got five days on that Monday two weeks ago three
[17:10.600 --> 17:15.600]  weeks ago you've got five days so I was getting mad about NDA a police state
[17:15.600 --> 17:22.240]  stuff Obama engaging in executive fiat legalizing the illegal aliens outside
[17:22.240 --> 17:25.440]  of law I mean this is real criminal treason and they're getting away with
[17:25.440 --> 17:28.640]  it why shouldn't they get away with more why not ship hang grenades and guns
[17:28.640 --> 17:31.800]  to Mexico to blend the second amendment and get caught not getting trouble why
[17:31.800 --> 17:36.280]  not why not why not announce they're gonna use predator and reaper drones
[17:36.280 --> 17:39.440]  against the American people and they're now using them to arrest people for
[17:39.440 --> 17:44.120]  in viral crimes and things and for quote cattle wrestling if somebody's cow went
[17:44.120 --> 17:50.280]  on their property in North Dakota so I say you got a five-day deadline I wanted
[17:50.280 --> 17:53.080]  to see what happened we did something in two phases just just you know learning
[17:53.080 --> 17:56.960]  and about putting posters up in public taking action not just fighting on the
[17:56.960 --> 18:01.880]  internet or radio or TV but in the real world and showing you your power and
[18:01.880 --> 18:06.880]  seeing local news coverage and we have had some local news coverage and we
[18:06.880 --> 18:11.360]  probably had a hundred entries or so millions of views total incredible
[18:11.360 --> 18:15.600]  videos incredible activism and they just cut the $5,000 check for phase one and
[18:15.600 --> 18:19.000]  I did a thousand dollars for the runner-up not that was in the rules but
[18:19.000 --> 18:23.680]  it was just runner-up was it was so close I mean I I quite frankly flipped a
[18:23.680 --> 18:29.080]  coin for who won I couldn't decide I do that quite often actually I like to put
[18:29.080 --> 18:34.680]  fate into things you know let the universe have a say in things not just my
[18:34.680 --> 18:42.320]  crude intellect and but only when I can't decide I'm usually very decisive and
[18:42.320 --> 18:55.880]  so then I noticed that we didn't get as many entries in and then I went wait a
[18:55.880 --> 18:59.880]  minute this has happened before and I set up front look for this but that
[18:59.880 --> 19:04.120]  matter nobody's bad it's just that it's it's it's you know the spam filter when
[19:04.120 --> 19:08.120]  it starts getting something over and over again it thinks it's spam all I know
[19:08.120 --> 19:13.080]  is a bunch of your entries from the last contest didn't get through and a bunch
[19:13.080 --> 19:16.600]  of the new ones because I was thinking well since I didn't hype phase two that's
[19:16.600 --> 19:19.560]  what we didn't get entries no we got a bunch of entries so I'm gonna extend it
[19:19.560 --> 19:22.920]  out to next Friday so we can post all the good ones that came in and if you
[19:22.920 --> 19:26.680]  didn't get through on phase one now you'll be judged in phase two for ten
[19:26.680 --> 19:30.040]  thousand dollars and you give people another week to also shoot their videos
[19:30.040 --> 19:38.400]  and get them up but that's just an example of how we need to you know promote
[19:38.400 --> 19:41.800]  and announce and analyze things not just turn things loose and not look at it
[19:41.800 --> 19:48.920]  okay well drones are harassing people I'm gonna talk about that when we come
[19:48.920 --> 19:53.080]  back and we got a red link up at drudgereport.com dealing with drones
[19:53.080 --> 19:56.760]  and we're gonna be talking about that we're also gonna get into some big news
[19:56.760 --> 20:02.160]  on the TSA front stay with us is key information I had tried everything I'd
[20:02.160 --> 20:06.120]  cut back the amount of food I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but
[20:06.120 --> 20:10.360]  nothing was working my body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[20:10.360 --> 20:15.120]  elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately could

[24:00.400 --> 24:27.840]  now it's publicly admitted now that the regular army marines all of them are
[24:27.840 --> 24:32.160]  training to pull triggers against the american people they are training
[24:32.160 --> 24:37.200]  explorer scouts nationwide not in every location but all over the country
[24:37.200 --> 24:42.280]  new york times associated press to take on disgruntled veterans for gun
[24:42.280 --> 24:49.480]  confiscation we first broke this in 1998 in hebron maryland got video of it but
[24:49.480 --> 24:57.320]  now it is nationwide the ROTC does not train to take on al-qaeda all over the
[24:57.320 --> 25:01.360]  country they trained to take on literally people wearing feed hats john
[25:01.360 --> 25:05.960]  dear hats in overalls i'm not joking we've covered we've written articles on
[25:05.960 --> 25:11.440]  it i've had the ROTC people on the show i could open the phones up right now and
[25:11.440 --> 25:17.920]  have ROTC calling and go yeah we trained to take on domestic grips and i have a
[25:17.920 --> 25:26.160]  army report here again on the reeducation camps psychological influences
[25:26.160 --> 25:32.000]  how they're going to have these grenade launcher units the fact that can
[25:32.000 --> 25:35.760]  fire four grenades at a time basically semi-automatic grenade launchers
[25:35.760 --> 25:40.200]  against us just all of our tax money to build a giant weaponized system against
[25:40.200 --> 25:47.200]  us the minute the military starts trying to fire on people it will turn into
[25:47.200 --> 25:51.920]  1776 and and by the way that's what the globalists are probably going to pick a
[25:51.920 --> 25:57.160]  time where they're leading provocateur forces against military and the
[25:57.160 --> 26:01.480]  controllers will be psych warfare experts who of course will be conveniently in
[26:01.480 --> 26:06.880]  the back and you're going to have activists who are really decoys doing
[26:06.880 --> 26:12.320]  terrible things so that the precedent is set that the military saved the
[26:12.320 --> 26:16.800]  children from the evil violent protesters because they'll want in the
[26:16.800 --> 26:21.640]  psych warfare call killers protesters that way that way when they call you a
[26:21.640 --> 26:27.160]  protester it means killer again they want to that's what they call terrorist
[26:27.160 --> 26:31.280]  overseas extremist so they can then call you an extremist for your views and it
[26:31.280 --> 26:35.520]  has that psychological connotation and this is all basic psych warfare and the
[26:35.520 --> 26:38.640]  most brainwashed for the military and police themselves that's why it's
[26:38.640 --> 26:42.680]  gotten so cartoonish the propaganda has that it's actually woken up a lot of
[26:42.680 --> 26:45.800]  military and police now because they march them in and start bad-mouthing
[26:45.800 --> 26:50.720]  America bill of rights constitution founding fathers and then connecting it
[26:50.720 --> 26:54.440]  to you know horrible things and the police are smart enough because they
[26:54.440 --> 26:57.400]  live in the real world and police have got a lot of problems but compared to
[26:57.400 --> 27:00.280]  the general public in many cases I found they're actually easier to get
[27:00.280 --> 27:05.000]  through to because they live in reality with action all day and even if they got
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.600]  in for the wrong reason or even if the system is corrupt there's something
[27:08.600 --> 27:15.040]  about reality it will get your head screwed on real fast now listen we're
[27:15.040 --> 27:19.760]  close to this right now we're close to a move for gun confiscation Hillary has
[27:19.760 --> 27:26.280]  said Obama plans to sign the small arms treaty that that says governments can
[27:26.280 --> 27:30.200]  basically restrict and take guns and register everybody and that's what it
[27:30.200 --> 27:35.240]  says and they're saying that his signature is what it takes for a
[27:35.240 --> 27:40.240]  treaty not Congress you're like but that's against the law well he launches
[27:40.240 --> 27:43.720]  wars without congressional approval he shuts down power plants that aren't
[27:43.720 --> 27:48.840]  owned by his buddies he shipped General Motors to China with your tax money
[27:48.840 --> 27:54.560]  paying for it 22 billion he told the military that they're run by the UN
[27:54.560 --> 27:58.640]  and NATO they're criminals have you have you figured that out yet and by the way
[27:58.640 --> 28:03.920]  you notice even Jack Welch of NBC and even Rupert Murdoch are coming out
[28:03.920 --> 28:08.040]  going hey you're gonna lose Romney if you don't at least say if you read the
[28:08.040 --> 28:10.320]  fine print of what they've tweeted and what they've written and what they had
[28:10.320 --> 28:14.160]  the Wall Street Journal put out yesterday as their mouthpiece well Murdoch owns
[28:14.160 --> 28:20.400]  it they're like hey Romney this is a tax and don't go along with Obama saying it
[28:20.400 --> 28:28.680]  didn't you know you need to use this to win you need to at least say hey hey we
[28:28.680 --> 28:34.640]  get wink wink hey we get the fact that you're not really gonna try to get rid
[28:34.640 --> 28:40.560]  of it but you better at least say it they say you better get some professionals
[28:40.560 --> 28:46.480]  in there who will help you win he's got professionals okay Romney's got
[28:46.480 --> 28:54.360]  professionals who know exactly what they're doing that is Ropa dope selling
[28:54.360 --> 29:00.840]  everybody out I don't know exactly what's gonna happen with all of this
[29:00.840 --> 29:04.760]  which puppet they're gonna put in because the globalists are gonna decide last
[29:04.760 --> 29:11.480]  minute themselves they can steal elections like that it's whoever can
[29:11.480 --> 29:15.800]  con the people the best but of course if he helped write it because that's who
[29:15.800 --> 29:19.680]  he works for the same people that Obama works for of course he's gonna come out
[29:19.680 --> 29:24.840]  and say well it's not really a tax it's a penalty and not and yeah I'll try to
[29:24.840 --> 29:30.960]  repeal it but you know let me give aid and comfort to the Obama camp see we're
[29:30.960 --> 29:35.360]  down to the wire now you're gonna really see who people are just like Roberts
[29:35.360 --> 29:40.840]  voting for the takeover of health care social engineering now we get back I'm

[33:19.120 --> 33:25.600]  exploitation phase for the globalist to invade the planet and engage in crimes
[33:25.600 --> 33:32.240]  unlistable because they are being created anew every millisecond this is
[33:32.240 --> 33:36.280]  part of the master plan to build the world government while destroying the
[33:36.280 --> 33:41.600]  republic's name the United States had been an example of freedom not perfect
[33:41.600 --> 33:47.040]  but the greatest peak of liberty ever developed and so it was a light to the
[33:47.040 --> 33:53.240]  world and something that the wicked ones and their master did not like and so now
[33:53.240 --> 33:59.440]  we have been taken over and turned into an engine of absolute wickedness we give

[34:03.680 --> 34:10.920]  abortion we have become degenerate we have invented new wickedness running
[34:10.920 --> 34:16.840]  about constantly inventing new wickedness and here we are here we are
[34:16.840 --> 34:23.120]  before the judgment before the fall of the republic to reeducation camps mass
[34:23.120 --> 34:28.240]  arrest and giant hordes of ne'er-do-wells who would never get a real
[34:28.240 --> 34:35.760]  job becoming our new gods our new rulers that is what sets before us as we go
[34:35.760 --> 34:41.680]  deeper into this land of tyranny and there are many people trying to stop
[34:41.680 --> 34:46.360]  this runaway train there are many people that have done whatever they could to
[34:46.360 --> 34:50.360]  warn you and to get you the information and many people were killed and
[34:50.360 --> 34:54.480]  imprisoned and tortured I remember interviewing decade ago congressman
[34:54.480 --> 34:58.760]  Hansen no criminal record great guy in the community exposing the Federal
[34:58.760 --> 35:03.360]  Reserve kind of a proto Ron Paul they arrested him on tax evasion just
[35:03.360 --> 35:06.800]  claiming he hadn't paid taxes and drove him around the country for six months in
[35:06.800 --> 35:11.360]  dieseling till all of his toes exploded until his guts were basically coming out
[35:11.360 --> 35:17.840]  of hand in that's what they do to torture you you imagine being chained up
[35:17.840 --> 35:21.560]  defecating on yourself for two three days at a time and being taken out for a
[35:21.560 --> 35:25.920]  few hours showered off with fire hoses and put back on a vehicle this is what
[35:25.920 --> 35:31.840]  the dungeon keepers do this is what this is what they enjoy this is this is what
[35:31.840 --> 35:39.280]  they live for and this is the hell now being released upon everyone now
[35:39.280 --> 35:49.120]  there's still time to turn back but it's going to take massive leveraging of
[35:49.120 --> 35:53.240]  energy it's going to take aggressive hitting the pavement and screaming from
[35:53.240 --> 35:57.440]  every hill and mountain that we are under attack it is going to take creating
[35:57.440 --> 36:03.840]  your own flyers and and and papering your town square every day it's going to
[36:03.840 --> 36:07.120]  take calling in to talk radio it's going to take putting up pirate FM
[36:07.120 --> 36:10.880]  transmitters that don't interfere with commercial stations it's going to mean
[36:10.880 --> 36:16.440]  you do whatever it takes to start a YouTube channel it's super easy that
[36:16.440 --> 36:20.320]  means don't have excuses I don't know how go get your neighbor that knows how
[36:20.320 --> 36:23.560]  because they know how to use a computer they can teach you tell them you'll
[36:23.560 --> 36:29.000]  mow their yard if they'll help you learn how to use YouTube I don't want to hear
[36:29.000 --> 36:35.960]  it anymore take action I am nobody but I saw the threat 20 years ago and spent
[36:35.960 --> 36:42.120]  three years trying to get on the air and I got on the air in 1995 and I got on
[36:42.120 --> 36:50.840]  local radio by 1996 and I got syndicated by 1998 in a limited fashion and I've
[36:50.840 --> 36:55.360]  expanded ever since because I'm silly and I'm ignorant at many levels but I
[36:55.360 --> 37:01.640]  want to know reality and if you want to know reality you will find reality I
[37:01.640 --> 37:05.600]  don't care if you're silly and ignorant you got guts guts is enough to quote
[37:05.600 --> 37:11.000]  full metal jacket that's what it's all about in this world these are just
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.440]  people we're fighting in fact guys I think I aimed it to you and over some
[37:15.440 --> 37:18.520]  reason my I am wasn't working this morning will you guys give me the
[37:18.520 --> 37:23.320]  dictionary breakdown the Wikipedia one's actually pretty good on guerrilla
[37:23.320 --> 37:31.240]  warfare little war warfare because I was reading communist tomes on it reading
[37:31.240 --> 37:34.880]  the boil down pages they all wrote books on guerrilla warfare guerrilla
[37:34.880 --> 37:40.560]  warfare little war warfare but it's not a communist tactic itself it's
[37:40.560 --> 37:44.720]  thousands of years old it's just leaderless resistance or low intensity
[37:44.720 --> 37:54.400]  conflict that's the point is is that everything the globalist do yeah print
[37:54.400 --> 38:00.920]  that for me is guerrilla warfare guerrilla warfare because they talk about
[38:00.920 --> 38:05.560]  whenever we advance and we're organized for a fight they retreat and you think
[38:05.560 --> 38:13.040]  of the TSA as overwhelming you know everything is from communist doctrine
[38:13.040 --> 38:17.640]  on guerrilla warfare and if you read their tactics and you'll see it
[38:17.640 --> 38:20.840]  everywhere they know in the federal government they're a small guerrilla
[38:20.840 --> 38:24.920]  force they know they've taken over they're up there they can't believe what
[38:24.920 --> 38:28.040]  they've gotten away with all the ridiculous things they're able to do and
[38:28.040 --> 38:32.080]  they're always just pressing it pressing it pressing it pressing it to get more
[38:32.080 --> 38:37.160]  more more more more thousands of drills over the last 20 years with the
[38:37.160 --> 38:41.320]  military secretly with the police if you talked about it they go oh black
[38:41.320 --> 38:44.840]  helicopters and like yeah I got video of it you leased the old school and blew
[38:44.840 --> 38:48.120]  it up and next to the nursing home and people had heart attacks and one lady
[38:48.120 --> 38:52.760]  died a few weeks later from it they're like oh it doesn't exist and I'm like
[38:52.760 --> 38:55.840]  what do you mean it's in the local papers here's the emergency manager Thomas
[38:55.840 --> 38:59.440]  Sanchez Vietnam veteran they came to him and said we're gonna do a martial law
[38:59.440 --> 39:05.640]  drill practicing taking over local cities he went and blew the whistle after
[39:05.640 --> 39:11.000]  it happened it's all in my police state film and and then I was made fun of it
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.560]  told it didn't exist well now it's all out in the open and we've got this report
[39:14.560 --> 39:19.080]  coming out in the next 30 40 minutes at info wars.com with how they're gonna use
[39:19.080 --> 39:22.880]  the grenade launchers on us the psychological warfare brigades how to
[39:22.880 --> 39:27.240]  control us in the reeducation camps and everything in this document that's an
[39:27.240 --> 39:34.720]  army current manual and we got it from an impeccable source will reveal him when
[39:34.720 --> 39:40.560]  I get to it he's broken other news here people didn't believe the first news he
[39:40.560 --> 39:45.160]  put out here and then the police later had to admit it at first they denied it
[39:45.160 --> 39:50.520]  up in Minnesota and then they came out and said okay we're gonna suspend the
[39:50.520 --> 39:53.760]  program oh like you didn't know what was going on the state police that they
[39:53.760 --> 39:56.680]  didn't know what was going on by the way the state police have bought some new
[39:56.680 --> 40:01.920]  one I think one was like a ten million dollar helicopter oh yeah to look for
[40:01.920 --> 40:07.080]  drugs oh yeah the drugs your bosses didn't ship in that's why my state
[40:07.080 --> 40:10.200]  police person pulls me over and says got any drugs in the car I'm just like
[40:10.200 --> 40:16.360]  come on man I only got the pineal gland and adrenal glands God gave me and you
[40:16.360 --> 40:21.600]  know what I'm see them right now on life you know the type of life where a woman
[40:21.600 --> 40:24.880]  could pick a car up off her little screaming baby that's what I'm on what
[40:24.880 --> 40:35.280]  are you on I'm on freedom buddy that's what I'm on I'm on truth better know
[40:35.280 --> 40:42.840]  what time it is now and again I have solace in this if this evil is able to
[40:42.840 --> 40:47.640]  win all of you that have served it will be forced to admit you were wrong as you
[40:47.640 --> 40:52.320]  are hurt by it any of you that think you can serve this system and gain power
[40:52.320 --> 41:00.000]  out of it your fools you cannot make a deal with the devil and you know in
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.520]  your heart the devil's real you know that evil forces real you can feel it
[41:04.520 --> 41:15.480]  right now the devil is weak but you think he's strong so you run to the devil
[41:15.480 --> 41:19.360]  the devil tricks you you know you had that archetypal story in all cultures of
[41:19.360 --> 41:24.440]  selling your soul the dark forces for power that's a trick the devil comes to
[41:24.440 --> 41:28.000]  you don't give you a deep secret here the devil comes to you when you're a
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.520]  child and you have that mystery and imagination and that sense that you're
[41:32.520 --> 41:35.960]  part of an incredible species with an incredible destiny and an incredible
[41:35.960 --> 41:40.560]  mission and here is this bland fake world built around you to make you feel
[41:40.560 --> 41:46.000]  small to make you feel disempowered or to make you feel inadequate so they can
[41:46.000 --> 41:50.760]  get you to accept their download of weakness and lies in the belief that
[41:50.760 --> 41:57.040]  you'll gain power out of it the devil comes to your spirit and speaks to your
[41:57.040 --> 42:03.240]  heart and says I will give you power you sense that power you sense that magic
[42:03.240 --> 42:10.480]  that majesty you sense that destiny you sense the figure 8 of infinity and the
[42:10.480 --> 42:18.360]  universe the heartbeat of creation that's my heartbeat I've got that I've got it
[42:18.360 --> 42:23.400]  I've got it serve me and I'll give you power and then if you get power through
[42:23.400 --> 42:28.040]  twisted evil it was the power God had already given you turned over to the
[42:28.040 --> 42:34.520]  devil as you pull his chariot as you pull his train and you think that power
[42:34.520 --> 42:39.520]  comes from the devil that power came from the creator that set it all in
[42:39.520 --> 42:44.920]  motion and you let the devil hack your soul and turn you like a zombie
[42:44.920 --> 42:53.600]  computer over to the service of darkness the devil's black rage is only a
[42:53.600 --> 43:02.000]  gross weak copy of one tiny element of the creator all the power all the
[43:02.000 --> 43:06.760]  discernment all the majesty all the electricity the rivers of life the
[43:06.760 --> 43:15.960]  creation the smiling children the singing the autumn wind on your cheek the
[43:15.960 --> 43:22.080]  moonrise it's all just the beginning of the creator it's all just the beginning
[43:22.080 --> 43:33.840]  of the untold unbelievably unimaginable power the devil didn't give you power the
[43:33.840 --> 43:42.000]  creator gave you the power and you let the devil steal it and harness you you
[43:42.000 --> 43:48.760]  are a slave it is pathetic you are a loser that power you think you have that
[43:48.760 --> 43:56.840]  dark flame of evil you worship that is a stunted twisted microscopic husk of
[43:56.840 --> 44:01.960]  what you would have been and that is what's so pathetic and so sad that you
[44:01.960 --> 44:06.280]  will never take those that have fully turned yourselves over to evil those
[44:06.280 --> 44:11.520]  that have persecuted the innocence with pleasure the door is closed on you and
[44:11.520 --> 44:16.600]  you think I revel in your destruction it's another victory for the black hole
[44:16.600 --> 44:22.840]  that is the devil another soul twisted and torn down another beautiful
[44:22.840 --> 44:31.120]  creation another spirit shining in flame destroyed made dark because you
[44:31.120 --> 44:38.880]  chose evil you chose to serve the dark side and you are torn down you were
[44:38.880 --> 44:44.800]  broken you were thrown down from the sky and smashed into the ground into a
[44:44.800 --> 44:51.440]  thousand ugly little pieces and you sit there looking at the ugly remnants of
[44:51.440 --> 44:56.680]  what you would have been and you see the reflection of God shining off the dark
[44:56.680 --> 45:01.400]  surface and you think that's God as you hold up a little chunk of evil in front
[45:01.400 --> 45:08.200]  of you and stare into it oh the power of Satan oh the power of it a tiny
[45:08.200 --> 45:27.840]  reflection of the entire universe around you fools fools fool fool and as we
[45:27.840 --> 45:40.200]  wind on down the road our shadows taller than our souls you know what that
[45:40.200 --> 45:54.560]  means you never knew what your soul was to begin with you traded your soul for a
[45:54.560 --> 46:05.800]  lie you traded your birthright for nothing you got conned so go ahead sell
[46:05.800 --> 46:09.680]  out to the New World Order and go to some functions and have important people
[46:09.680 --> 46:15.320]  shake your hand and feel like you've arrived couldn't pay me to be around
[46:15.320 --> 46:20.200]  those people you couldn't pay me to sell out
[46:20.200 --> 46:25.080]  God Almighty could say I'm gonna throw you into hell if you don't join the
[46:25.080 --> 46:28.320]  devil God would never do that and I'd say then throw me into hell I will not
[46:28.320 --> 46:34.920]  join the devil I would burn in hell forever to make sure evil was defeated I
[46:34.920 --> 46:40.400]  would be killed and tortured and anything to stand against these people not
[46:40.400 --> 46:44.880]  because I'm even a good person on the surface but because in my heart I know
[46:44.880 --> 46:51.560]  there is no making a deal with this there is no making a deal with it it
[46:51.560 --> 46:57.320]  doesn't want to make a deal it wants to hurt you it wants to pull you down it
[46:57.320 --> 47:08.440]  wants to hurt everything that's good there is no choice but to become a
[47:08.440 --> 47:13.400]  servant of good there is no choice there is no choice how could there be a
[47:13.400 --> 47:19.520]  choice how could you ever want to serve evil how could you ever I know why
[47:19.520 --> 47:25.880]  programmed from birth they want to make us automatons but that human spark made
[47:25.880 --> 47:33.040]  in the image of the Creator will defeat it all right I'm ranting I've got a lot
[47:33.040 --> 47:41.560]  of news to get to we we have a big show today and I've got so much news and I
[47:41.560 --> 47:46.920]  want to take your phone calls as well it's very exhausting to stare into
[47:46.920 --> 47:55.680]  reality I know why people buy into facsimiles of reality because they're
[47:55.680 --> 48:00.800]  much smaller they're much thinner it's like a lake that's a thousand miles
[48:00.800 --> 48:06.920]  across but half an inch deep looks expansive but it's like a facade at a
[48:06.920 --> 48:15.640]  movie set like where they film stagecoach or something but the real
[48:15.640 --> 48:22.280]  thing that's the difference it's like a soundstage for a movie of Monument
[48:22.280 --> 48:27.360]  Valley versus being out at shun up or sundown in the middle of Monument Valley
[48:27.360 --> 48:32.320]  on horseback Monument Valley Utah it it's the difference of being in some
[48:32.320 --> 48:39.880]  stale quiet musty dead building with a painting on the wall that isn't even
[48:39.880 --> 48:43.360]  done very good because it's meant to be blurred in the background with a long
[48:43.360 --> 48:47.440]  focus or whatever you call it it's it's a difference of being in there sitting on
[48:47.440 --> 48:51.680]  a bench a roach walks by and you're just sitting there in a hot dusty building
[48:51.680 --> 48:58.240]  nobody's around looking at a painting on the wall versus the cool night air and
[48:58.240 --> 49:05.520]  the stars and being in Monument Valley that's the difference between good and
[49:05.520 --> 49:12.600]  evil because evil is not a creator and it wants to be but all it can create is
[49:12.600 --> 49:17.840]  death destruction all it can do is screw things up and it wants it all and it
[49:17.840 --> 49:21.520]  wants it now and again you can sell there is no good and evil oh it's all
[49:21.520 --> 49:25.120]  just instincts oh it's all just genetics oh it's all predisposed oh it's
[49:25.120 --> 49:38.200]  already gonna happen that you know in your heart that's not true you know it
[49:38.200 --> 49:42.120]  from all your experiences in life that's not true
[49:45.640 --> 49:51.520]  okay when I come back this story is red linked to the drudge report we had it on
[49:51.520 --> 49:54.680]  yesterday and I should have gotten talking more about it he's like I wasn't
[49:54.680 --> 49:57.320]  even gonna talk about this but it happened I live out in the middle of
[49:57.320 --> 50:02.680]  nowhere very rural area between a hoot and a holler Joseph Farad had one of
[50:02.680 --> 50:07.520]  the weed eater drones police drones fly over and look at him who's out walking
[50:07.520 --> 50:14.000]  his dog didn't have a camera and there's the kind of harassment goes on Travis
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.560]  County helicopter people I don't know like 14 years ago were outrageous I was
[50:18.560 --> 50:21.480]  trying to get the funding cut for new helicopters so they went to my parents
[50:21.480 --> 50:25.040]  house because for whatever reason that's where I'm listed as living even though
[50:25.040 --> 50:28.960]  I've never lived at the house that they still live at that they lived at for like
[50:28.960 --> 50:33.360]  20 years I guess at some point I had mail sent there when I was in college or
[50:33.360 --> 50:37.880]  something and so they came there flew about 20 feet off the ground flip my
[50:37.880 --> 50:41.760]  mother off then they found out where I was staying one night with my girlfriend
[50:41.760 --> 50:45.120]  now married to her and came over there came right down and shine lights right
[50:45.120 --> 50:49.920]  in the windows the next night I mean it's just like so that's this is all about
[50:49.920 --> 50:56.640]  spy drone buzzes journalists secluded home and we'll get into TSA the most
[50:56.640 --> 50:59.400]  insane thing they've done yet but it makes perfect sense you know why they're
[50:59.400 --> 51:04.160]  doing it let me ask you a question what does freedom mean to you freedom to

[54:36.400 --> 54:42.560]  new policy that is really not new is TSA explains bizarre new policy of testing
[54:42.560 --> 54:48.560]  drinks purchased in airports agency claims it is attempting to be
[54:48.560 --> 54:54.440]  unpredictable yeah like being on the parking lot of the airport now or on
[54:54.440 --> 54:58.600]  highways yeah you're unpredictable the Homeland Security just set up a group
[54:58.600 --> 55:02.360]  who have 80 hours of training and aren't sworn or bonded or under the
[55:02.360 --> 55:07.360]  Constitution the FBI can't do what you do but you can do everything people ask
[55:07.360 --> 55:10.240]  well how did Hitler have brown shirts before he was even in office run around
[55:10.240 --> 55:14.640]  beat people up because he had the giant force and just did it we're being run
[55:14.640 --> 55:18.280]  over and every time we're going to protest and opt out or getting their
[55:18.280 --> 55:22.880]  face they stand down because they're guerrillas the really a warfare they're
[55:22.880 --> 55:29.240]  attacking us when we flee they pursue when we pursue they flee when we attack
[55:29.240 --> 55:34.360]  they pull back when we're asleep they attack okay everything they do is
[55:34.360 --> 55:39.880]  warfare I don't just say that they're following warfare programs you see them
[55:39.880 --> 55:44.000]  in the news going it's not a tax but they admit it's a tax never mind oh well
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.960]  they say there's no drones but they're admitting the drones boy everything they
[55:47.960 --> 55:52.280]  do is what a occupying army would do you know they declassified it about 20 years
[55:52.280 --> 55:59.520]  ago I showed it last year on air clips of army psychological occupation and we
[55:59.520 --> 56:03.040]  played clips of it on air it's on YouTube there's hours of it and it talks
[56:03.040 --> 56:06.200]  about the US taking over a third-world country and helping suppress the
[56:06.200 --> 56:10.440]  population and they're fighting communists in this case but the tactics
[56:10.440 --> 56:14.480]  are exactly what authoritarians would use as well and it's all real creepy where
[56:14.480 --> 56:17.800]  they talk about psychological warfare and lying to people and they giggle and
[56:17.800 --> 56:23.080]  it's fun it's meant for troops to watch it and think being a weird creepy lying
[56:23.080 --> 56:28.760]  person is good again like Jack Bauer torturing people's children to get
[56:28.760 --> 56:35.520]  answers and he's always right this is this is so twisted how they seduce
[56:35.520 --> 56:41.440]  people over to evil by increments and they're now saying that it's they want
[56:41.440 --> 56:46.160]  to be unpredictable read the article at info wars.com but TSA is attempted to
[56:46.160 --> 56:50.880]  explain a way a bizarre expansion where you go through the checkpoint and I've
[56:50.880 --> 56:57.720]  seen it while I'm sitting there eating barbecue and got an ice water and they
[56:57.720 --> 57:00.400]  walk over and start swabbing people's drinks and taking them away and saying
[57:00.400 --> 57:10.120]  take a drink of that inside at the food courts and see because it's all fake the
[57:10.120 --> 57:12.920]  people that drive on the airport with the food deliveries just swipe a card
[57:12.920 --> 57:16.240]  anybody could be down at their dock knock them on the head drive in with a
[57:16.240 --> 57:19.720]  thing full of C4 but there aren't real terrorists ladies and gentlemen almost
[57:19.720 --> 57:24.040]  all of its manufactured even when a real z-hottie attacks you usually they were
[57:24.040 --> 57:31.440]  funded up the line by the globalist on record on record on record and they
[57:31.440 --> 57:36.320]  always sell a tyranny on an unpopular minority first but in all the manuals
[57:36.320 --> 57:40.640]  that good police military send us who's it always really about people that don't
[57:40.640 --> 57:44.240]  like the new world order people that say that there's a global banking cartel
[57:44.240 --> 57:48.720]  that's going to bankrupt the world and bring in a planetary regime who wait all
[57:48.720 --> 57:54.120]  those ADL some Bobby Law Center reports the last 15 years it all came true if

[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:25.560]  all right I'm gonna blitz through some of the top stories here we have big
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:30.440]  breaking news with confirmed army documents that add to the other pile of
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:35.160]  reeducation camps sustained massive warfare they've trained in Iraq and
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:40.400]  Afghanistan door-to-door roundups killing political dissidents just
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:45.200]  absolute treason being prepared no wonder the military is waking up and
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:49.440]  going oh you're absolutely right alex you've had military confirmed that they
[01:08:49.440 --> 01:08:54.160]  have got states prepared to go against other states under federal command that's
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:58.400]  in the john war defense authorization act but that they're actually training to
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:03.480]  send in armor and air from other states into states they think that may secede
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:11.000]  but the union was hijacked by foreign banks who announced they've conquered us
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:18.560]  on the news like Hitler parading Paris after they surrendered and you know what
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:21.200]  most the cops went out and saluted Hitler and said all right we're under
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:26.440]  German control now they were called the Vici French and I guess that's really
[01:09:26.440 --> 01:09:29.760]  what's happening here I mean it's I mean I'm not guessing that's what's
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:33.320]  happening because they just do it by increments and now they have the TSA out
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.160]  there engaging in every form of bizarreness you can imagine it seems
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.280]  bizarre if you really believe they were trying to keep you safe from imaginary
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.520]  terrorist that the globalist openly fun in Libya and Syria that's back in
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:49.840]  mainstream news TSA explains bizarre new policy of testing drinks purchased in
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:54.240]  airports agency claims it is attempting to be unpredictable now again to be
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:57.440]  clear I've seen this for at least three years but now they're announcing it because
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.720]  it's going in everywhere you you go through you you go to a shop because now
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.080]  you need the little thing of shampoo and you need the toothpaste because you
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.600]  can't have that because you're a terrorist and you need the bottle of
[01:10:09.600 --> 01:10:13.120]  water and maybe you go get a sub sandwich because you're gonna get on the
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:17.160]  four-hour flight don't we all do that you go get it you stick it in your bag
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:23.960]  and here comes waddling up people with a cart and they're now starting by the way
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:28.800]  I saw this eight years ago or about seven and a half years ago when I was in San
[01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:33.280]  Francisco I saw them searching people at the gate I was a group of a world war
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:38.200]  two vets wearing their caps from the USS Arizona that had survived I'll never
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:43.920]  forget this and back then I was not really intimidated but I wouldn't pull a
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:47.000]  camera out you know on the security at a gate because I knew they'd come after me
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:52.880]  nowadays I just do it I'm done I don't I don't care and I mean I've told the story
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.520]  probably 20 times that this one World War two vet wearing the Arizona hat had
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.760]  his wife with him who looked like she was about two steps from the grave he was
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:03.760]  about half a step from the grave I bet that guy died within a month he was
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:07.360]  going back to see his buddies his eyes were peeling down with water dripping
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:10.000]  out of them you know and somebody looks like they're about to you know literally
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.640]  he had a walker and an oxygen tank and this guy jabbering at him was some
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.200]  private security they had there was called I think Wolverine security bright
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:24.040]  blue something like cover commander would wear going I couldn't understand
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:28.480]  what he was even saying gibbering at him and poking at him and the old guy
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:36.160]  obviously had hearing aids on didn't even know what planet he was on I mean
[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:40.640]  imagine you got an old man who looks like a reanimated corpse okay I mean he
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.520]  looked that bad okay there was wife and there's a bunch of guys getting on a
[01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:53.640]  plane to go to the the World War two Pearl Harbor Memorial a few days later
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.440]  I was back in Austin and remember on the news there was the you know there was the
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.480]  whole event I'd seen the guys fly out of San Francisco to Hawaii I mean you
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:06.760]  imagine wanting to come over and gibber and jabber and poke at some old man
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.760]  because they don't understand you
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:15.040]  imagine the lowness of someone like that we've had Colonel Craig Roberts on who
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:17.800]  flies a lot he talks about how he's seen that himself it's like there's
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:23.640]  something about these wolves these these these wimps who want to be predators who
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:28.760]  who when they see a woman or a child or an old person it gets it and and the
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:33.000]  worse off they are the more excited they get like you see an old person you
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.720]  immediately want to go over and help them and and and you think about your
[01:12:37.720 --> 01:12:41.320]  grandmother your grandfather where you think about you know memories come back
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:44.960]  of visiting people in their deathbeds and you want to honor the old and then
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:52.160]  you see these people and and and that's what our country's become that's who we
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.560]  are it is a religion of treating us like garbage running us into the ground
[01:12:57.560 --> 01:13:03.080]  dominating us and so okay you want to trade liberty and freedom and a stiff
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:10.160]  backbone with a jellyfish servile system knock yourselves out knock yourselves
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:16.600]  out I'm preaching again PSA explains bizarre new policy of testing drinks

[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:15.920]  just start getting into the what the TSA is doing and it just it's gonna get more
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:20.440]  and more insane if you think them yelling freeze because they tell you to walk
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:23.720]  out and go stop stop right there and they put in a little prisoner booth and
[01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:29.000]  they have you put your hands up and it's total prisoner training and now
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:33.560]  they're hiring criminals to take your daughters and sons behind closed doors
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.720]  to strip search them and they go well we don't call it strip searching but we do
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:45.000]  take your clothes off and just like every tyranny they hire a bunch of goons to
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.920]  do it if you thought the bizarre power trip behavior the TSA could get any
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:55.560]  crazier thing again according to a friend a political commentator Lou Rockwell the
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:25:00.160]  federal agency is now ordering travelers passing through security to freeze on
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:07.800]  command explaining how he got how he had arranged with his family to split up as
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:11.280]  they were passing through airport security he corresponded whose story is
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:16.400]  posted Lou Rockwell.com explains how he heard a commotion from a different
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:21.480]  security line he heard freeze freeze or something like this coming from the
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:29.080]  output side of so-called false security where my wife was followed by further
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:33.880]  barking of commands from where I was I couldn't see much it turns out they were
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:38.440]  doing a new drill they want all passengers to freeze on command my wife
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:42.320]  told me later that she didn't follow this order fast enough so the subsequent
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:47.800]  barks I heard were directed at her yeah this is getting you ready you want to
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:51.640]  see what a reeducation camp looks like it's very accurate it's in the movie
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:57.920]  children of men where the globalists have sterilized everybody's society is
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:02.320]  collapsing and the bus rolls into the reeducation camp and they're pulling
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:05.240]  people off they want to shoot on spot those they're going to torture those
[01:26:05.240 --> 01:26:10.600]  that they just send into the ghetto but they've got a fence around and that is
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:15.240]  exactly what this is in fact guys will somebody go rent that or buy that or
[01:26:15.240 --> 01:26:18.520]  Netflix it because we can I want a fair use show a clip of that because that is
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:23.320]  incredibly accurate when they roll into that they got barking you know dogs and
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:27.160]  all that it looked like a Maryland when they forcibly inoculated 2,000 people
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:32.520]  five six years ago it's actually covered in the greater good DVD and they had
[01:26:32.520 --> 01:26:35.880]  police dogs black uniforms it's the law got to take shots will arrest you if you
[01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:41.600]  don't there was no law it's just all a criminal exercise of power to to set this
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:46.480]  up and so yes now the screaming in fact I've already gotten reports of this
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:52.160]  before and of course you know you have a metal detector gets unplugged oh my
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:55.560]  gosh terrorists must have got through stop all the planes pull everyone off
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:58.800]  oh now we've got to be in the parking garage because terrorists might be there
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.720]  oh they might be out at the end of the highway coming into the airport we got
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:04.720]  to have a checkpoint there oh they might be down the main road towards that road
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:08.080]  we got to be down there oh they might be at the park we got to be there oh they
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:11.680]  might be at the shopping mall got to be there and then the TSA is now running
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.240]  federal and the insurance companies are saying your mall has to get federally
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:21.920]  certified and they say a TSA inspector must come and you must comply so see just
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.280]  the new security everywhere I almost didn't speak when I was in Santa Cruz
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:29.400]  Michael's whirling did a great job getting me out there I'm on two of his
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:34.640]  fine stations we had a 2,000 people total come out to the two events because it
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.600]  the place held like 900 plus but it's sold out in a few days so I booked the
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:45.680]  second day and so the mall security the boardwalk you know theater security it's
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:50.080]  like an outdoor mall said he's not gonna speak if we don't run security and they
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:53.160]  were real nice treating me like I was a president or something again they really
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:56.240]  figured out this culture so I'd get into it and I'm not mad at the station
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:00.680]  they're great folks they groped everyone coming in and of course you're there and
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:04.440]  it's like we you know we got to check them and I guess it's for my safety but
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:09.360]  you know what I'd rather be free look listen I'm not living in fear this I
[01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:14.000]  if somebody wants to kill me they do it out in the parking lot I mean I see
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.920]  Glenn Beckett events he has like 30 people and they'll call a SWAT team out
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:23.840]  for him our reporters have been at events where the president is and people like
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:29.240]  Glenn Beck you have more security just I mean shoot me now if I was ever gonna
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:33.680]  live in that much fear I mean I just don't understand this but again this
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:38.680]  this tyranny is a culture set up by cowardly people this is what they're
[01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:44.920]  into and I'm I'm already digressing be technical he had more security in an
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:51.760]  event in Mitt Romney not the president yet not yet okay I've got this entire
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:55.200]  other stack of drone news you know Joseph Farrah had not told anybody about
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:01.080]  this but I guess he felt like he should go ahead and say it on my show and and
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:07.400]  hey guys I forgot it we bringing that email the world that Bailey sent me it
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:11.080]  doesn't say it's not for air does it I don't know why they sent it to me I did
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:15.000]  I read like 90% of it during the break and I just wanted to make sure before I
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:22.360]  show it that I they didn't well then obviously it's be used on air then anyways
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:25.720]  I'm gonna get Farrah back on next week to talk more about this but he lives out
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:29.520]  in northern Virginia you know in the hills on a piece of property with no
[01:29:29.520 --> 01:29:33.080]  one around him and here comes the police drone you know with its little
[01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.080]  flashing lights and little legs I gotta get him back on to describe more of her
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:40.400]  for people because off air he described more of it than on air because he was
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.760]  again doesn't want to be a conspiracy theorist so he was kind of timid about
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:48.840]  even telling the story but now it's up on the drugs report red-linked will tell
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:54.640]  you about that we come back we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones

[01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:03.400]  something trying to be conservative I read through much of the hundred pages
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:09.400]  because I could speed read got it this morning of the new army field manual and
[01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:14.320]  we've confirmed its authenticity and our source is impeccable but we also
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:18.040]  confirmed it through another source I'll just leave it at that by the way the
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:23.760]  source will be on tonight mr. fight who broke the news up in Minnesota of the
[01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:27.160]  state police drugging people and giving them free drugs including cocaine and
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:33.160]  heroin to set them up as informants to basically false witness against people
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:36.120]  first that didn't exist and all the state police didn't know and the mayor
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:40.200]  didn't know turned out they all knew about it and the report was real he was
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:44.920]  able to get this document a lot of this stuff's public part of it isn't so we're

[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:01.560]  to even get to it because I guess it's summertime and all the RV engines that
[01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:03.960]  are blowing up are blowing up now it's like trying to get the air condition
[01:35:03.960 --> 01:35:10.920]  repair personnel you know in 108 degree temperature and the guy shows up at

[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:20.320]  hours a day well thank you for coming thank you for fixing the air conditioning
[01:35:20.320 --> 01:35:23.000]  so it's the same thing I was gonna go to Colorado take my son with me do some
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:27.240]  reporting out there but just for a week and a half but I'll be here now I still
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:32.200]  I'm gonna have Mike Adams and the great John B. Wells both of them great people
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:36.200]  filling in one day a week next week so I'll take my children to the lake or
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:42.560]  something but side issue drum roll please because this latest Army manual is
[01:35:42.560 --> 01:35:51.160]  the worst yet it is the most out of control most tyrannical horrible
[01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:56.000]  confirmation of everything we've seen so far and Watson has the headline Army
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:03.520]  manual outlines plan to kill rioters in America actually it says rioters but see
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:06.280]  that should be citizens defending themselves as the police will just pull
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:11.720]  back like they always do it isn't just rioters it's protesters it's people
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:16.560]  pro you know trying to take their government back so it's
[01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:24.960]  prepares to repel 1776 but the point is is that it says civil disturbance
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.000]  period and under the codes in here and we've seen this born out in military
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.280]  training I filmed but also in Pittsburgh where my reporter got arrested that they
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:37.600]  announced on the loudspeakers no protest no being outside if they say
[01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:42.640]  that civil disturbance and then they kill you now it's just rubber bullets and
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:48.280]  stuff sound cannons microwave guns they are preparing to try to and of course
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:52.160]  it'll it'll be just it'll be done perfectly government agitators will
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:56.120]  have groups that people like to look down on when the welfare checks won't buy
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:00.560]  goods anymore because of hyperinflation during a collapse or other scenarios
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:04.080]  this is one of the prime scenarios they've got from just reverse engineering
[01:37:04.080 --> 01:37:07.520]  everything they're doing and all the documents we have that then they'll
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:12.040]  start shooting at fire department people like they always do got to know
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:18.560]  that's provocateur most of it and then oh my gosh and then the mowing down of
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:22.840]  people will begin and then oh thank goodness the army came in restore order
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:26.880]  we're just accepting this now even though it was a 15 year old plan by ram
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:30.240]  corporation to roll this out right as the secretary of the army calls for it
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:35.400]  it's all been to acclimate you and all to get you ready that patriotism is oh
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:38.800]  I forgot the good part there is gun confiscation when you saw it in
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:44.040]  Katrina they're gonna cordon cities and you prove your good and get the food and
[01:37:44.040 --> 01:37:48.920]  get a travel pass when you turn all your firearms in and of course the army is
[01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:54.280]  going to be searching your house and guess they've got a backup youth brigade
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:38:01.800]  a Hitler Eugen a Stalin Eugen a Mal youth brigade don't they always they've
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:06.160]  got the explorer scouts we've been training for at least five years to
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.440]  get to house-to-house gun confiscation I mean I have it from 15 16 years ago
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:18.680]  1998 but many years ago was that yeah like 14 years ago I have that but but
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:23.400]  confirmed that you in the New York Times they're training for house-to-house gun
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:27.800]  confiscation and Arcadia, Iowa they said in the news the army will practice
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:32.840]  locking down the city of 675 and we'll take the guns local gun shop and we'll
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:38.520]  go door-to-door confiscating weapons in a drill and then I read the report it was
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:43.280]  like hoax website says gun confiscation even though they said it like
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:46.400]  there are no drones even though there goes one right there but there are no
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:52.440]  drones hey this thing's a tax the Supreme Court says so do you know it's not but
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:57.440]  it is a tax the IRS takes the money out of your account and if you don't buy it
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:02.920]  from the private groups you're just like never mind no it's not you're like yeah
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:08.120]  it is no it's not yeah it is no it's not yeah it is no it's not and they just
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:11.320]  want to keep you in that inaction because they found in psych warfare
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:14.920]  actuaries most folks will just go okay well whatever you're wrong I'm right
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:19.440]  they're like sure I know you are but what am I I mean it's just these games
[01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:23.560]  they play look they're criminals if the average person in government isn't bad
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:27.920]  that's one thing but you work for evil criminals okay the country's been
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:30.840]  captured the only way to turn this around is they're trying to bring in the
[01:39:30.840 --> 01:39:34.400]  EAS to take over media they're trying to talk about shutting websites off with no
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:37.920]  due process now they're talking about arresting people cast Sunstein is the
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:41.920]  White House who criticize government I mean they're really trying to see if
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:46.480]  they can get you to do it and during a collapse they'll say go arrest the
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:51.080]  political dissidents cops and your paycheck will work that's basically
[01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:56.320]  what it's going to be and and if you then show up and do what they ask you to
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:40:02.160]  do it's over they're going to win because you're going to get killed in
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:05.120]  mass and so are citizens and then they're going to bring in the I-4 troops
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:07.960]  in the NATO troops they've been training for oh we're going to be talking
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:13.320]  about Operation Black Star with Colonel Craig Roberts next week he's going to be
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:17.920]  joining us with Key Antel former Army Intelligence Marine Corps sniper

[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.320]  arm and get him on the show he's also somebody that died for 10 minutes and
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:38.120]  they couldn't necessitate and of course you know what he saw because we only see
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:42.720]  a very tiny band of what's really going on that's why I feel sorry people they're
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:46.920]  blind spiritually you have no idea ladies and gentlemen okay so I might as
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.120]  we'll get to it now I mean here it is Army manual outlines plan to kill
[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:54.000]  rioters in America you notice they're announcing oh we you know what we've
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:57.680]  been developing armed drones for decades and here police departments train with
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:02.560]  them real fast they got shotguns they got 50 cow they got riot guns they got

[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:54.920]  it's exactly that I mean these people are open scum criminals trying to take
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:59.520]  over the country right now I mean it's happening and everybody's like I think
[01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:03.800]  Mitt Romney will save us really he's like it's not a tax opama's right I helped
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:08.720]  write it for the big banks that run me but I might repeal it just me just give
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:12.680]  me a break give me a break give me a break like well maybe it'll get better
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:18.080]  once Mitt Romney gets in the elite get what they want yes I will agree in deep
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:23.280]  analysis the Democrats on average are more mafia more street thug more more
[01:42:23.280 --> 01:42:27.080]  more will kill you if you're criticizing them Republicans just go ahead
[01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:30.680]  and just do whatever they want you know Republicans just ship guns into
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:33.800]  Mexico to destabilize it and get control of the drug trade to put it in the
[01:42:33.800 --> 01:42:37.080]  banks they didn't try to bring the guns back and then blame the Second
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:41.520]  Amendment with it you know I'm sure I guess Obama is worse he he he he went
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:45.640]  that I guess the country club Republicans even though they're tyrants
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:50.240]  they still kind of like freedom and kind of like the way things all used to be
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:53.480]  kind of like all the rich Republicans you know that go into the country two
[01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:57.120]  step and dive bars and want to have fun the cops kind of leave those alone
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:02.000]  cuz you know the you know the the big boys like it that way listen you're

[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:44.640]  loving police drone the one little four legs buzzing with the flashing lights
[01:45:44.640 --> 01:45:51.160]  they mean they've they want you to know they're there me flying around his
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:58.360]  property and believe me I know it went on because I've got to enjoy the
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:01.840]  visitations by the helicopters you're like oh they probably thought that was
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:05.520]  marijuana grown in your yard or something no folks they were flipping my
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:09.840]  mother off because for whatever reason my parents address still shows that's
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:15.760]  where I supposedly live even though I never lived there I took mail there 20
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:19.880]  years ago and so they get the visit with the guy hanging out flipping her off
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:23.240]  two days after I went to County Commissioners Court and talked about
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:27.400]  how the 11 million dollar German helicopter was too much and how they
[01:46:27.400 --> 01:46:34.200]  didn't need another one and so they dropped by and then they dropped by they
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:40.760]  found out where I was really at this is what government does it's a joke send
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:46.040]  any more messages here okay I'm out of control today look look I'm being
[01:46:46.040 --> 01:46:48.960]  conditioned though the fact that I'm sitting around joking and laughing when
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:53.200]  we have an army document talking about gun confiscation in fact that's a whole
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:56.400]  another article I need to get Watson to do one on that let me or I can get
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:00.880]  curtain in mother to it this is all breaking so fast okay okay I've just
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:05.560]  got a reset I'll get to it later let's go ahead and go to your phone calls and
[01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:10.080]  I'll get to all this coming up let's talk to Nicholas in Pennsylvania and
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:18.960]  Shane DJ Joe Eleanor and others go ahead you're on the air hi Alex so yeah I
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:23.400]  totally agree with you with this I heard you earlier talking about children of
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:30.000]  men and I think it's a great a great film and you know people don't really see
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.640]  you know the symbolism in it and you know that's really important but I just
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:39.480]  have a couple of questions right now I'm taking care of my grandmother's
[01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:44.840]  apartment buildings and you know I've just been really curious about the real
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:51.600]  estate market and I mean everyone knows it's been really bad but and also some
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:56.280]  of my other family members have houses and stuff so what do you know about the
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:48:01.920]  real estate market right now if the globalists decide that they've got a
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:07.680]  back off and go slow the real estate market will go back up nationwide not
[01:48:07.680 --> 01:48:12.960]  to previous levels but up I would it guesstimate within two to three years if
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:17.560]  they decide to hammer down which every indication shows they're going for broke
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:21.000]  they're publicly running al-Qaeda attacking countries they're publicly
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.960]  gutting everything Romney's not showing any sign of changing course
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:28.800]  conservatives if he gets elected will just suddenly sit down and love it all
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:33.840]  so either way we're in trouble every indication is the globalists think and
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.840]  I think they're probably right that they're gonna end up all going to
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:41.280]  prison unless they get it all and they're gonna end up losing that too but
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:44.280]  they're just going whole hog I mean we might as well have a cross between
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:51.000]  Mao Zedong Stalin and Hitler mixed into one running things looking at us right
[01:48:51.000 --> 01:48:55.600]  now trying to figure out how they get everybody to do the horrible things they
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:49:03.040]  want them to and so the future destiny is up to you it is not some set thing
[01:49:03.040 --> 01:49:08.680]  out there it is it depends on what you do if they of all their spying and
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:14.480]  algorithms think that they're not gonna be able to get away with this already
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:18.680]  they don't have a good chance of getting away with it but they love to
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:21.800]  dominate and even though their computers are telling him they're not gonna get
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:27.240]  away with it they are so used to it and they can't imagine they're gonna lose
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:32.200]  they show that Hitler turning into Russia Napoleon going to Russia you know
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:38.680]  Nero thinking he was God the megalomania has shut in and it's setting in with
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:42.680]  their minions you know the one good thing is their minions are such trash and
[01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:47.520]  so stupid and I'm talking about you know the TSA type folks the the the code
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:53.200]  enforcer bureaucrat type are so pathetic or awake some of them are awake you know
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:58.200]  if you have a brain you're awake that it's all about our compliance so at this
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:50:02.280]  point pick whatever you can stop complying just stop complying with
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:07.760]  whatever you can I mean here's an example one crew member says when he gets
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:11.360]  tickets he just keeps sending it in with the wrong paperwork over and over again
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:15.120]  and and just procedurally and you could tell it goes in the problem stack and
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:20.320]  later just gets thrown away sabotage them what's Sabo means sandal in French
[01:50:20.320 --> 01:50:26.280]  sticking it in machinery sabotage them sabotage everything this is an enemy
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:32.400]  we're occupied and so peacefully lawfully sabotage everything sabotage
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:38.200]  sabotage sabotage sabotage sabotage every little act against them every little
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:42.280]  poster hung up every time you stand up to somebody get in your face every time
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:47.400]  you talk back to the TSA person every time is one step closer to victory does
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:53.760]  that answer your question well I guess so yeah I'll have to look a little more
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:57.600]  into the real estate market but yeah I mean all that stuff is God bless your
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:06.200]  brother sabotage folks have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:10.080]  switch to get the lights back on if so this is going to be the most important

[01:53:54.920 --> 01:54:08.480]  that's 1-800-493-7561 you know that last caller sounded disappointed and I'm
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:12.560]  sorry I can't give you a definitive answer I would have had to ask you where
[01:54:12.560 --> 01:54:18.720]  are you in the country then I have to go research the trends there I would have
[01:54:18.720 --> 01:54:22.880]  to I mean there is no definitive answer on what you should do with your real
[01:54:22.880 --> 01:54:30.320]  estate and I understand you're managing a building for your for your
[01:54:30.320 --> 01:54:34.880]  grandmother but I don't know what to say I mean I can't really give you advice
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:41.000]  on something that's so specific in your area I mean take real estate in Texas it
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:45.200]  had a fall in the 80s that wasn't in the rest of the country and so Texas real
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:49.800]  estate on average never got up to the over-inflated levels of other areas so
[01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:56.120]  our bust was not as bad and in some areas of Austin it's actually come back but
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:02.960]  that varies not just city to city but area in the city so I try to give you a
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:08.560]  real answer but I mean if I can't give somebody a really good answer I I am not
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:13.880]  qualified to give you advice in your own life there there is a very good
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:17.880]  chance there could be a total collapse and it's an engineered collapse to bring
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:22.000]  in world government run by the bankers in their own words they say this I've
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:27.080]  played the clips here CNBC two weeks ago probably played it ten times or more
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:34.440]  probably 15 times in fact cue it back up for me please this is what's going on so
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:40.880]  I can't give you advice because it's all up to these lunatics and what they do is
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:45.760]  governed to a great extent by what we do so that's the bottom line right there
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:50.200]  again mainline systems will teach you well this could happen or that could
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:56.360]  happen it's all what we do let's go to Shane in Washington you're on the air
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:00.800]  hey Alex how you doing love the show man thank you so much for waking me up in
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:07.600]  January thank you brother hey I had the honor and privilege to meet Jordan
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:13.120]  Maxwell and I got to see a presentation a lecture that he did down in LA about
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:21.440]  the dawn of a new day about the Soviet symbolism and I was wondering if you're
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:25.800]  gonna be or had any plans on having Jordan on and yeah Jordan has been booked
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:31.640]  on the show like five times and then he always wants to move it a few weeks down
[01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:35.560]  he has a bunch of stuff going on he was booked like two weeks ago he was booked
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:39.720]  a month before that people call and ask him on and I'll get more calls ask him
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:44.560]  on but you've got to ask Jordan if he wants to come on the show oh okay that
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:48.600]  sounds good and then I also I did want to bring up the fact that when I did go
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:53.560]  down there I took the Amtrak and they pretty I'm it's getting bad on the
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:57.880]  Amtrak too I went down there and as soon as I got off the train I mean these
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:01.320]  detectors or whatever they were just pretty much singled me out of my
[01:57:01.320 --> 01:57:07.680]  pajama no no no no no they're TSA inspectors and they just do whatever
[01:57:07.680 --> 01:57:11.600]  they want feds who aren't even feds out of their jurisdiction with an 80-hour
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:16.680]  training course and they are doing the new American handshake of grabbing your
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:21.000]  genitals on the highway and I mean they're not just in train stations brother
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.160]  they're demanding to put their hands on your wife now on the side of the road I
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:30.600]  mean it's over they're criminals red alert mayday so so what they do they
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:33.240]  have they singled you out what they say
[01:57:33.240 --> 01:57:38.040]  I'll search my bag I went through all my stuff messed up my luggage and we're
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:42.200]  smiling and laughing well it happened and then at the guy had the audacity at
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:45.840]  the end of the search to try to slap hands with me and I just kind of laughed
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:49.640]  at him and just kind of give him a cold shoulder I guess oh he didn't like the
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:53.320]  fact that you were laughing so he wanted to like be friends well see it's
[01:57:53.320 --> 01:57:57.160]  important to be friends with your prey no we're not your friend we don't like

[02:01:08.160 --> 02:01:13.360]  from the St. Louis area and I think it's really important that people know
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:18.560]  and understand what happened and what everything looks like when after the
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:23.560]  FEMA police went through tell folks about the police and military regular
[02:01:23.560 --> 02:01:27.720]  army training with the tanks on the streets tell us about what the what it's
[02:01:27.720 --> 02:01:34.240]  like when FEMA comes to town oh you're you have no windows left in your house
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:40.040]  I'm not kidding there are no windows left your house looks like a ghetto and
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:45.160]  you're the whole neighborhood looks like the ghetto now you know and I mean
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:50.360]  there's no windows left there's you know they they fire a lot of shots and
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:55.440]  shooting so a lot of stuff's blown up so ma'am you were you were actually in an
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:02:00.120]  area where they lease houses then don't tell you and blow them up because I've
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:04.760]  actually been to those oh so they blew stuff up in your neighborhood oh yeah
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:10.840]  everybody north of Manchester Rose data you know pretty much everybody got a
[02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:17.040]  visit by the FEMA police and they go through your house no no judge no jury
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:20.600]  no court order no nothing I'm gonna stop you ma'am because I've seen them do
[02:02:20.600 --> 02:02:24.240]  checkpoints and I had the cop calling and break down crying about it I almost
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:29.760]  sent reporters but there's been so many drills I didn't you're telling me that in
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.600]  that north st. Louis drill that they admit they did with the police they
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:37.320]  told folks to stay away you're telling me they did a gun confiscation drill
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:44.160]  they came in your house well I don't know what they if they did if they
[02:02:44.160 --> 02:02:49.200]  confiscated everyone's weapons I would imagine the only drill for it but I'm
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:54.440]  saying who came tell me government came to houses tell us what happened
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:03:01.800]  um well if you go through the area now pretty much nothing's left I mean I
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:09.160]  mean anything of any good I mean I saw this in in meta gene when it's happened
[02:03:09.160 --> 02:03:14.080]  to see most Americans haven't been through a civil war so they don't know I
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:19.640]  have so I understand I know and I understand man for two weeks that for
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:23.000]  two weeks there were hundreds of tanks thousands of troops running around
[02:03:23.000 --> 02:03:26.800]  terrorizing people but the media would never say what they were doing tell us
[02:03:26.800 --> 02:03:34.320]  tell us what happened well everybody in the in north of Manchester Road
[02:03:34.320 --> 02:03:40.800]  literally got a visit by the FEMA police they literally went in their house
[02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:46.000]  they went and saw what they had confiscated whatever they wanted you
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:52.160]  know and the people were people don't know what to do and then I heard two
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:57.680]  policemen you know talking outside my house about it and they said well we
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:03.480]  have to do this now because by October and I'm like by October what you know
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:08.480]  no one has answered their question yet by October what you know I don't know
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:15.040]  what's going on by October we have to go in and man I should have sent my
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:20.960]  reporters I just have such a small crew right now that that didn't send them
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:24.680]  even I do something special was going on up there well you saw Katrina they use
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:28.200]  it to go high and dry even areas that were nice had their lights on and would
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:32.320]  come in and break up and safe and steal the guns people never got them back they
[02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:37.400]  would arrest us the homeowners and this is what they're training for ma'am so
[02:04:37.400 --> 02:04:43.840]  you're saying I want to get your number off air I want to call you and I guess
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:47.320]  I guess we're gonna have to send the reporters up there and then you can be
[02:04:47.320 --> 02:04:51.360]  our guide or maybe that police officer can be off duty and take my guys around

[02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:07.160]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:11.200]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:15.080]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:19.120]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:07:19.120 --> 02:07:23.680]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:07:23.680 --> 02:07:27.720]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:31.520]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:07:31.520 --> 02:07:35.120]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:39.480]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:42.640]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[02:07:42.640 --> 02:07:46.280]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:51.080]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:55.320]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[02:07:55.320 --> 02:08:05.200]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 ease the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:17.480]  the GCN Radio Network. Coming up here about 20 minutes we have the female
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:22.760]  contest winner for Info Wars reporter she wins $5,000 Center for Collins popping
[02:08:22.760 --> 02:08:27.120]  in for about 10 minutes then we have the male contest winner Jakari Jackson
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:32.640]  joining us but she's in Ohio he's in Oklahoma but I'm gonna interview here in
[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:37.720]  the next few weeks the other some of the other top reporters they were all so
[02:08:37.720 --> 02:08:41.440]  good I mean just the top 10 that was more like top 20 or 30 there were so
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:48.120]  many great people and we're gonna go through the list and find out who we
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:52.600]  can afford to get in here because believe me I'd like to have 20 reporters
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:56.520]  and be able to send them to things when there's an urban warfare drill in St.
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:09:00.520]  Louis and the police call in and say it's for martial law and then we
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:05.680]  discover that they are doing gun confiscation drills just like we saw in
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:08.840]  Katrina but it's all building towards the head and I'm gonna get to our top
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:14.840]  story again it just went up at info wars.com about 30 minutes ago and
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:19.440]  Watson's headline does it justice but it's not as bad as it is the headline
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:28.520]  should be Army manual outlines plans to confiscate firearms kill Americans but
[02:09:28.520 --> 02:09:33.560]  it says Army manual outlines plan to kill rioters in America warning shots
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:39.440]  will not be fired and it goes on to say civil disturbance period which under
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:42.320]  these federal training they say protesting and they go they will not
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:46.520]  tolerate civil disobedience you know under this code we have banned
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:50.760]  protesting or being outside and then they couldn't find anybody to resist them
[02:09:50.760 --> 02:09:54.480]  in Pittsburgh where my reporter got arrested being up on a hilltop
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:10:00.040]  videotaping at night at the University G20 was over that morning it's the
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:04.880]  University people aren't even protesting they're just out there you know at 8
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:09.800]  o'clock at night in the University Commons and here comes police from every
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:15.880]  road marching in Darth Vader outfits because they're real men all in their
[02:10:15.880 --> 02:10:19.000]  mob psychology all wearing their mask so they can you know play the part of the
[02:10:19.000 --> 02:10:25.040]  devil and be women on bicycles beating them with Billy clubs and they'd cry and
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:28.560]  the cop would walk over full force and just crack it over her head and so what
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:32.320]  do people die you know they have red socks when a woman walked out of a bar
[02:10:32.320 --> 02:10:35.320]  and they shot her at two feet away with a rubber bullet blowing her brains out
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:39.120]  and they know it would do that it's it's manly that's like whoa Bob's tough
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:42.560]  around the office who you killed a woman you know this is what it's all about and
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:45.600]  don't worry the bankers are gonna kill your bank account they're gonna kill you
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:51.240]  with fluoride in the water you're gonna get to share too I understand I
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:55.680]  understand I understand you're the tough guys you're the winners you're gonna
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:11:02.040]  show America I got it I got it a lot of police are waking up but I'm just
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:06.600]  putting the line out there right now you better decide which side you're on this
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:13.120]  is real Army manual outlines plan to kill rioters in America a newly leaked US
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:19.360]  Army military police training manual or civil disturbance operations outlines
[02:11:19.360 --> 02:11:22.360]  how military assets are to be used to massively the quell riots confiscate
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:27.520]  firearms and even kill Americans on US soil during mass civil unrest the
[02:11:27.520 --> 02:11:32.320]  document PDF which is dated 2006 and was used for self-learning courses at the
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:37.000]  US Army military police school at Fort McClellan oh see it's been going on a
[02:11:37.000 --> 02:11:40.680]  while that's that one where we discovered all the FEMA camps from
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:44.400]  insiders makes it clear that the operations described in the manual
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:49.640]  apply to both Connors and O Connors meaning inside the continental United
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:52.760]  States and outside the continental United States yeah like the reeducation
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:57.120]  camps as well and see here's the deal six months ago on the public you know
[02:11:57.120 --> 02:12:01.400]  Fed websites where they put out the contracts hundreds of millions a month
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:05.920]  just getting the company teams ready to be able to activate FEMA camps within
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:10.960]  74 hours or 72 hours over at the exact amount so see they're they're getting
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:14.280]  them out of deep freeze they're firing them up they're prepping them and they're
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:16.880]  lining and they're doing drills just everywhere to get you acclimated so
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:20.560]  what's going on down there at the city hall with all the shooting oh it's just
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:28.040]  a drill they're taking out some terrorists let me continue here again
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.400]  it's acclimation they're converting you from a free country to a slave country
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:35.920]  with a TSA all of it the document outlines how military assets will be
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:40.920]  used to help local and state authorities to restore and maintain law and order in
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:45.120]  the event of a loss of riots chivalron rest and declaration of martial law oh
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:51.200]  declaration of martial law because the you know the things collapse but the
[02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:55.520]  bankers have got a plan to fix it they're good people world government run
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:13:02.080]  by guys do we have the clip about slaves the bankers let's again this is our
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:06.800]  military works for people are like don't be mean to our military boy okay I mean
[02:13:06.800 --> 02:13:10.240]  if the Russians were in command of our government with that but I'm supposed to
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:16.320]  fall down to the military again foreign banks took over they want to destroy our
[02:13:16.320 --> 02:13:20.640]  way of life we've got to tell the military what they're being trained for is
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:24.400]  illegal and explain to them that they're going to engineer this where it looks
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:29.440]  like what they're doing is good to set the precedent for the open occupation
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:33.160]  and then the military is just going to bring in force while the TSA has their
[02:13:33.160 --> 02:13:38.040]  way with us okay that's the plan and the IRS rapes your bank accounts and tracks
[02:13:38.040 --> 02:13:41.640]  your purchases with the new casual system coming up you still have cash
[02:13:41.640 --> 02:13:44.560]  you're just going to face scan and thumbprint to buy and sell the cameras
[02:13:44.560 --> 02:13:48.800]  are going in everywhere now let's go ahead and it's just instant you just walk
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:55.160]  in and the and singles just pay with your face they're admitting that notice
[02:13:55.160 --> 02:13:59.400]  they're rolling it all out now they're just getting you ready here here they are
[02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:04.440]  telling you who runs our military here it is so mostly what they do is hold
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:09.880]  summits I think that right now the question is do we all work for central
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:14.080]  bankers that's what I want to address to our guests tonight in this global
[02:14:14.080 --> 02:14:18.720]  governance at last is it one world the central bankers in charge Jim Jim Yorio
[02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:23.760]  you say we've got some downside here a correction in the markets fine but aren't
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:28.080]  we all just living and dying for what the central banks do aren't we all just
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:32.000]  counting on the fact that there's a Bernanke pot put and that we won't go
[02:14:32.000 --> 02:14:36.760]  any lower than say five percent down from here of course we are because if we
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:40.360]  look at the economic data there's not that's enough I did about in that they
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:43.640]  go on to say well we're slaves but we kind of need to be you know this is kind
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:47.560]  of cool it's kind of cool right now what's happening because there's no
[02:14:47.560 --> 02:14:51.040]  world government though I mean police you can walk right in to your training
[02:14:51.040 --> 02:14:54.840]  room and go right in the files and pull out 20 years of files saying if
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:58.240]  someone says foreign banks are taking over their terrorists that want to kill
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:04.800]  cops but it's all admitted hundreds of articles a month coming out admitting
[02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:08.600]  world government run by bankers show can you think one step ahead they're gonna
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:15.160]  blow up police stations the globalist are to the blame and on what's left of
[02:15:15.160 --> 02:15:18.640]  America so you get in a fight with us so we kill each other that's the plan
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:23.920]  that's Oklahoma City part two are we smart enough to not go along with us
[02:15:23.920 --> 02:15:30.960]  probably not probably not it's gonna be too much fun and the pageantry of the
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:35.640]  big funerals for the dead cops and the president coming and we're gonna get
[02:15:35.640 --> 02:15:40.800]  these radicals and you know cops will get to fold the flags and everything and
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:45.040]  you'll get a little motorcycles and have a parade and you'll shake the hand of
[02:15:45.040 --> 02:15:50.760]  the people that killed kill the cops because it's it's fun to get invited
[02:15:50.760 --> 02:15:55.160]  to the party and then you could start a civil war with the American people
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:59.800]  trying to take their guns in which tens of thousands of police will be killed
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:05.000]  but that won't be on the news those will be quiet funerals just the first ones
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:10.280]  the president goes to well those will be the big ones and it'll all be very
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:16.880]  exciting of course natural they've killed me if they get away with that if
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:20.520]  there'll be lots of demonization stories and horrible things I did on the news
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:26.320]  you'll get to learn how you know mad dog Ben Richards the butcher of bakers feel
[02:16:26.320 --> 02:16:29.640]  why here's the video of him doing it I mean you you know the running man

[02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:55.160]  well I tell you this is really a creepy field manual earmarked for homeland
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:17:02.240]  patrols and gun confiscation I don't know you might want to get this article out
[02:17:02.240 --> 02:17:06.600]  to everybody or maybe it's too real for everybody maybe this is too real maybe
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:10.520]  I should just shut up hey you know what things are collapsed and we're gonna need
[02:17:10.520 --> 02:17:14.680]  the army Alex Alex you got it all wrong the army didn't try to take our
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:20.600]  freedom they gotta do this cuz things are collapsing oh really really really
[02:17:20.600 --> 02:17:26.120]  really tell me something I don't know yes I know they're gonna be rolled out
[02:17:26.120 --> 02:17:30.760]  during the collapse but the collapse was engineered Jack and I told you about it
[02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:35.640]  long before it even began I'm so tired of people calling me going Alex did you
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:44.520]  know 9-11's an inside job no no no I didn't know that I'd never imagined that
[02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:55.000]  I'd never talked about that it is so frustrating sometimes to just have the
[02:17:55.000 --> 02:17:58.240]  evil right out in the open and the globalist and all these documents saying
[02:17:58.240 --> 02:18:02.280]  they're gonna reduce the world population by at least 80% after this
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:06.000]  control grids in place and they're following an exact program so I know
[02:18:06.000 --> 02:18:10.080]  what they're going to do next in general moves I know what the next phase is and
[02:18:10.080 --> 02:18:16.240]  I sit here like a movie I've seen 20 times but now I'm living it in the real
[02:18:16.240 --> 02:18:19.240]  world and knowing what's gonna happen next and I go out and listen to the
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:23.040]  general public and they sound like idiots they sound like they don't even
[02:18:23.040 --> 02:18:28.200]  know what planet they're on and then the leader like well that's why you should
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:33.120]  join us well when I've had big media people offer me jobs and things like
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:38.520]  that it's always like you've noticed how stupid the public is and you've noticed
[02:18:38.520 --> 02:18:42.960]  that they're jealous of your success and they would tear you apart if they ever
[02:18:42.960 --> 02:18:46.640]  could all you can do is survive within the system and try to work from within
[02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:52.200]  it's not perfect but believe me you're not going to help these people they
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:57.240]  don't want to be helped Alex and I know there's a lot of powerful people
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:00.800]  listening right now who were given those same speeches they're like wow yeah
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:07.320]  it's a standard speech okay it is a standard standard standard deal those
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:12.720]  people are just mid-level okay at the top the globalists have a master plan
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:17.600]  that's published in many different places it's always the same same same
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:22.160]  report just in different different variants of set up a world government get
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:27.320]  control exterminate the population in phases blaming it on natural or terrorist
[02:19:27.320 --> 02:19:33.320]  causes finally remove the population down to 10% of what it was probably they
[02:19:33.320 --> 02:19:37.880]  say 80 and the deeper manuals are go ahead and kill most of that 10% down to
[02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:41.800]  less than 1% of the world population with the elite merging with super
[02:19:41.800 --> 02:19:45.680]  technologies and living forever now I don't know that's really gonna happen or
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:49.840]  not but that's the game plan now let me ask police the military do you think you
[02:19:49.840 --> 02:19:54.720]  got a place in that plan you think you can make a deal with this group that
[02:19:54.720 --> 02:20:00.240]  gives you DU knowing it's gonna kill you I rest my case we'll be right back

[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:17.440]  on three weeks putting together this video that I haven't even decided the
[02:24:17.440 --> 02:24:23.440]  name of yet I extended the show into the fourth hour today coming up but every
[02:24:23.440 --> 02:24:28.680]  every six seven eight videos that are long and have a lot of edits in them you
[02:24:28.680 --> 02:24:34.840]  get what we call the wheel of death on a Mac computer with Final Cut Pro and it
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:40.200]  had been compressing the 20-minute video for about three hours when it got the
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:48.760]  wheel of death so the wheel of death as we call it and so we are going to air it
[02:24:48.760 --> 02:24:52.960]  tonight who knows this project taken so long about be 50 years from now we put
[02:24:52.960 --> 02:24:57.760]  a lot of work into it Aaron's busted his butt on it now we it's like a mini
[02:24:57.760 --> 02:25:03.760]  documentary about the nature and secrets of humanity and our destiny and the key
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:06.760]  crossroads were at I mean it's one of the most important things we've ever
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:11.880]  produced but I had an incredible first hour I think I was really flowing with a
[02:25:11.880 --> 02:25:18.560]  public displays of understanding here I was jogging this morning and I was
[02:25:18.560 --> 02:25:22.200]  having these understandings and I was actually able to telegraph it with some
[02:25:22.200 --> 02:25:27.360]  degree of oratory purity during the first hour that's coming up going to
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:32.520]  retransmit in about 30 minutes we got some guests coming on but we should be
[02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:37.800]  able to air this big special report tonight on the nightly news if it's
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:41.960]  compresses in the next four or five hours but seven o'clock tonight is when
[02:25:41.960 --> 02:25:45.280]  the show airs so we've got it done by seven we can put it in somewhere there
[02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:49.920]  but do not hold your breath ladies and gentlemen if not it'll be top posted on
[02:25:49.920 --> 02:25:55.080]  info wars calm and prison planet calm throughout the weekend I'm gonna just
[02:25:55.080 --> 02:26:01.320]  put out a memo and say leave it at the top please because it's time for gut
[02:26:01.320 --> 02:26:05.840]  check ladies and gentlemen and I cannot believe we're letting a bunch of weird
[02:26:05.840 --> 02:26:09.880]  deceptive criminals run things so what if they've got a bunch of sophisticated
[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:15.280]  propaganda once you're aware of who they are it doesn't matter and the people
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:18.240]  that are going to carry it out for them have no idea what they're part of on
[02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:25.120]  average and we're here telling you the magic trick let's go to DJ and then
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:30.360]  we'll go to others go ahead DJ in Minnesota you're on the air hey Alex
[02:26:30.360 --> 02:26:33.180]  I just wanted to say obviously I wouldn't feel comfortable starting the
[02:26:33.180 --> 02:26:37.680]  conversation I was saying thank you very much thank you for putting up everybody
[02:26:37.680 --> 02:26:43.040]  thank you no I really appreciate it but the new news is going up right now Army
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:46.680]  manual outlines plan to kill writers you know I myself and a bunch of friends
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:50.520]  were here from Minnesota and we did plan on going down to Tampa you know for the
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:54.120]  RNC we're Ron Paul supporters do you think that this kind of falls in a
[02:26:54.120 --> 02:26:59.240]  timeline with what's going on a kind of how this comes out and then the RNC is
[02:26:59.240 --> 02:27:03.320]  happening in in August and in this lady called that coffee talking before me a
[02:27:03.320 --> 02:27:07.240]  thing they're talking about martial law in October which is two months after the
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:10.120]  RNC about a month before the election do you think that they're kind of gearing up
[02:27:10.120 --> 02:27:16.720]  for like well listen the feds do this the feds do this to get police and military
[02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:20.240]  to really hump it now it doesn't mean that one day they won't actually pull
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:24.600]  the trigger with a hot takeover but it's it's the drilling that actually brings
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:29.240]  in the martial law we're already in it to a great extent we're not even bonded
[02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:32.920]  law enforcement not even peace officers federal or state are groping you and
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:36.600]  your family and now on the highways I mean we're already in there already
[02:27:36.600 --> 02:27:40.280]  taking your bank account without a judge jury or anything the IRS is we're already
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:47.360]  under martial law to a great extent they told police six months before they
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:51.160]  staged the H1N1 which turned out was manufactured was staged it was a
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:55.160]  simulant virus wasn't even really that dangerous all that came out we were
[02:27:55.160 --> 02:27:58.520]  able to break it here years later it was confirmed by the EU Commission and
[02:27:58.520 --> 02:28:03.120]  others they told police that we had on and they told an emergency manager head
[02:28:03.120 --> 02:28:08.440]  of a major city in Indiana that we had on the show not saying his name that
[02:28:08.440 --> 02:28:13.080]  there would be a million dead in Illinois Indiana that there would be
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:17.200]  martial law from flu that season just getting them ready so when the feds
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:22.080]  created fear local constabulary would buy into the hysteria and then rumors
[02:28:22.080 --> 02:28:25.680]  would spread so it's the same thing they go to cops they go yeah we're gonna go
[02:28:25.680 --> 02:28:29.240]  you know we've leased this neighborhood in this area that's we're gonna do urban
[02:28:29.240 --> 02:28:33.480]  drills and you know if we see any crime we're gonna have the military deal with
[02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:37.360]  it how's that sound and it's all to get the cops used to it and so you go to
[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:41.360]  North St. Louis you do the drill it freaks out some cops that identifies
[02:28:41.360 --> 02:28:45.800]  who's awake other cops show they'll go along with it they're they're marked down
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:50.240]  as they're ready to go it's all a gauging it's like the globalists are

[02:33:24.200 --> 02:33:30.160]  have been so busy since we announced the winners last week last Friday of the
[02:33:30.160 --> 02:33:35.760]  info wars dot com nightly news reporter contest I haven't had a chance to get
[02:33:35.760 --> 02:33:41.000]  them on until now and we've got jacari waiting in the wings we've also got
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:44.560]  Jennifer who we're gonna go to first here in just a moment and then we've got
[02:33:44.560 --> 02:33:48.000]  all these other great reporters who we've got a fly down here or
[02:33:48.000 --> 02:33:53.120]  diplomatic interviews with and see if they want to join this crazy team because
[02:33:53.120 --> 02:33:57.440]  we definitely need the help and by the way I've done two and a half hours here
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:34:01.080]  and if not plugged any products or anything you notice most cock show
[02:34:01.080 --> 02:34:04.480]  hosts it's every other break or plugging something because people don't listen to a
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:08.480]  lot of the commercials anymore show you do the plugs live on air I'm not doing
[02:34:08.480 --> 02:34:13.640]  that because I'm so focused on all the news and then I'm looking at the bank
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:17.600]  accounts and we need to raise some more money to be able to expand in the face of
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:21.040]  this turning because we just can't send reporters out to everything that's
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:24.520]  happening like what's going on in st. Louis with the martial law takeover
[02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:28.680]  drill that was confirmed gun confiscation drills the army documents
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:33.240]  how they're preparing them for it this is some scary stuff so be sure and visit
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:37.280]  info or shop.com for the best prices on the water filters the books the videos
[02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:43.440]  the t-shirts the end the TSA not in the Fed we've got those two but in the TSA
[02:34:43.440 --> 02:34:46.640]  next time I fly I'm flying with that and when they don't like it I'm gonna go hey
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:50.600]  you don't like my first amendment is it bad to you're gonna tell me to freeze oh
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:55.360]  you're getting in my face go get the cops because you're not even a cop you're
[02:34:55.360 --> 02:35:00.280]  a joke oh you don't want me to fly good I'll sue you individually oh sure we'll
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:03.760]  get maybe throw out a court but wait till I put private investigators on you
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:09.280]  how you gonna like that see I'm done playing games with these people I'm
[02:35:09.280 --> 02:35:13.080]  ranting let's go to our guests we're gonna have them back in the future and I
[02:35:13.080 --> 02:35:16.600]  hope that we can work something out and hire Jacarie Jackson and Jennifer
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:21.640]  Collins and four or five of the other reporters because it's just hiring people
[02:35:21.640 --> 02:35:26.200]  is a big job but very soon we're gonna try to get folks down here but they are
[02:35:26.200 --> 02:35:30.240]  the financial winners $5,000 I'm told those are gonna be mailed out today to
[02:35:30.240 --> 02:35:33.840]  Jennifer Collins and Jacarie Jackson since they're on Skype we can only go to
[02:35:33.840 --> 02:35:38.160]  one at a time let's go to Jennifer Collins for a few minutes first Jennifer
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:41.880]  thank you for coming on welcome to the show oh thank you Alex it's a pleasure
[02:35:41.880 --> 02:35:45.880]  to actually get to speak with you and this is the first time we've talked
[02:35:45.880 --> 02:35:50.040]  your your video Skype just froze that's fine how did you wake up to the New
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:54.320]  World Order tell folks about the submission that you put in we've got the
[02:35:54.320 --> 02:35:59.360]  top video at our YouTube channel is your entry and Jacarie's entry if folks
[02:35:59.360 --> 02:36:03.560]  want to see them but I mean tell folks about yourself and the info war and
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:08.440]  about the piece that you did okay well actually I started really listening to
[02:36:08.440 --> 02:36:14.120]  your show around Fukushima when that catastrophe happened I had actually
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:17.120]  listened to your show before that but that's when I started really listening
[02:36:17.120 --> 02:36:21.920]  every day because it was the only one revealing what was really going on over
[02:36:21.920 --> 02:36:27.960]  there in Japan during that whole catastrophe my piece I actually submitted
[02:36:27.960 --> 02:36:34.520]  two different submissions and the first one you know I wasn't that passionate
[02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:38.840]  and I had actually never done anything like this before a friend had actually
[02:36:38.840 --> 02:36:43.080]  told me about the competition and then I saw it on your show and they encouraged
[02:36:43.080 --> 02:36:49.320]  me to enter it and I said no I really didn't think I had a chance at being
[02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:56.640]  considered even so I saw Dan Bidani's piece with Ron Paul which was completely
[02:36:56.640 --> 02:37:01.400]  awesome because he actually got to interview Dr. Paul and that really
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:10.000]  inspired me because everybody just loves Dan Bidani oh he's great and
[02:37:10.000 --> 02:37:15.160]  actually getting up there and speaking to him I mean that that takes a lot of
[02:37:15.160 --> 02:37:20.680]  fortitude and and he wasn't nervous or he didn't appear to be nervous and he
[02:37:20.680 --> 02:37:24.560]  really just went for it and that that's very impressive well that's why you won
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:27.880]  because out of all the incredible ladies and we want to try to hire some of the
[02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:31.880]  others as well is because you came with a good idea for a report you did a
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:36.680]  professional job and that's what we're looking for we're looking for I mean you
[02:37:36.680 --> 02:37:41.240]  did a great job tell folks about your report well I went to a Mitt Romney
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:45.360]  rally and in a little myitivity I actually thought I'd at least be able to
[02:37:45.360 --> 02:37:50.200]  shout a question at him this was when Cisco was really hitting hitting your
[02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:55.520]  site and the importance of that bill and how it squashes all of the citizens
[02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:59.640]  rights and I thought I'd at least be able to scream at him you know you know how
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:03.920]  do you feel about Cisco because we know how he responded to the NDAA that he
[02:38:03.920 --> 02:38:11.600]  would sign the order as well so when I got there I he had this whole area set
[02:38:11.600 --> 02:38:15.200]  up and I was told he was gonna come out to speak after he was speaking inside on
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:20.840]  a college campus and he wasn't coming out and so I decided well you know what
[02:38:20.840 --> 02:38:25.640]  I'm gonna go in there and see if he's coming out to speak they had everything
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:32.760]  set up I mean it was very it was very very different because there was
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:36.840]  nobody there and I love how your piece shows there were more cops there than
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:40.840]  people to see Mitt Romney no one I know has ever seen one of his bumper stickers
[02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:45.320]  except Richard Reeves and Dallas saw one I haven't seen it and I've had people
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:49.120]  ask me you know I've never seen any other bumper sticker except for Ron Paul
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:53.920]  bumper stickers and that's the only bumper stickers I actually saw one Rick
[02:38:53.920 --> 02:39:00.240]  Santorum I think last week Ron Paul was the real winner they stole the first
[02:39:00.240 --> 02:39:04.360]  you know two states from him and that's one reason I'm irritated with Ron Paul
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:07.800]  not mad at him I just am irritated that he won't stand up and say what we all
[02:39:07.800 --> 02:39:14.160]  know right yeah it's very frustrating because he is the real winner I mean he
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:18.160]  he was cheated out of Iowa he was cheated out of Maine I mean there's so
[02:39:18.160 --> 02:39:22.520]  many states he's cheated and if you look at the maps of the reporting it looks
[02:39:22.520 --> 02:39:27.840]  so skewed I mean really you're coming in at 12 10 to 12 percent in every county
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:32.040]  it counties don't vote like that those counties are usually because I've been
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:38.640]  watching county returns for years since 2002 are actually 2000 and they just
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:42.360]  don't look like that normally they they have you know this person wins a lot
[02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:46.240]  more percentages somewhere else that this person doesn't in a state and it
[02:39:46.240 --> 02:39:52.880]  just really looks suspicious and it's it's just fraud at this point with that
[02:39:52.880 --> 02:39:58.920]  now you're in Columbus Ohio right yes I haven't had a chance to talk to you yet
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:02.240]  and I know Rob do is gonna be working on some of the hiring in the first phase
[02:40:02.240 --> 02:40:06.720]  has but I'll just say it now are you ready to move down here to Austin Texas
[02:40:06.720 --> 02:40:15.320]  well I really really really want to I don't know I might have to consider maybe
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:20.360]  a correspondent position if if I were to be hired right now just because I'm in
[02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:26.040]  school and I'm trying to finish that up but it's so tempting believe me I really
[02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:32.280]  would love to what are you going to school for I'm getting my PhD oh cool
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:38.160]  pH I mean I'm just curious PhD and what in theater oh well that's fantastic you
[02:40:38.160 --> 02:40:44.160]  know the whole world is a stage and players upon it yes all right well
[02:40:44.160 --> 02:40:48.000]  listen that's exactly what we're planning is to try to hire some of the
[02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:52.880]  people obviously not at a you know for as much money but to be correspondents and
[02:40:52.880 --> 02:40:56.360]  to go around do reports for us but where you would have the maximum effect
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:41:02.120]  would be right here in the you know center of the resistance and there's so
[02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:07.520]  many great people and you did an amazing job and so certainly how long till
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:13.520]  you get your PhD how long yeah well I'm finishing up a lot of things by December
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:20.320]  this year and after that I'm just writing a dissertation all right no big
[02:41:20.320 --> 02:41:24.560]  deal all right well I listen very exciting will be in touch with you
[02:41:24.560 --> 02:41:29.080]  congratulations on winning and your check for 5,000 is in the mail as they say
[02:41:29.080 --> 02:41:34.040]  thank you so much thank you great job all right folks there goes Jennifer
[02:41:34.040 --> 02:41:41.560]  Collins she won from her great state there and she is the winner of the female
[02:41:41.560 --> 02:41:45.520]  contest and again as I said don't feel bad if you didn't win the money because
[02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:49.680]  a lot of these women and men are saying well I can't actually move there
[02:41:49.680 --> 02:41:54.560]  so so it all comes down to who wants to move here and quite a few of them do
[02:41:54.560 --> 02:41:58.720]  want to move here so there's a lot of things going on but this is very very
[02:41:58.720 --> 02:42:03.480]  exciting now talking to Jacarie Jackson I believe he's in Oklahoma and I
[02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:07.120]  certainly hope he's ready to get down here if not correspondents great it's
[02:42:07.120 --> 02:42:10.240]  just we're so busy we'll never be able to really correspond we need people
[02:42:10.240 --> 02:42:15.240]  actually here to really really see how the see how the you know soup gets made
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:19.600]  around here but Jacarie Jackson did a great job with his report Jacarie thank
[02:42:19.600 --> 02:42:24.800]  you for joining us how you doing Alex good hey so tell us about yourself tell
[02:42:24.800 --> 02:42:28.720]  us what you think I went in the contest tell folks about your report well first
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:32.320]  of all I want to give all glory to God and Christ my savior I mean if that's
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:37.320]  the most important thing I could say if nothing else my report it's something I
[02:42:37.320 --> 02:42:40.400]  went out and shot with my dad he was actually my cameraman we just went out
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:45.840]  one day I was flipping through the newspaper and I saw the the advertisement
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:50.640]  for the luchador run and I started to go out there I said if nothing else that
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:53.720]  would be visually interesting you know cuz I could have went to a library and
[02:42:53.720 --> 02:42:56.840]  got you know the same answers for people but you know it's a visually
[02:42:56.840 --> 02:43:01.320]  interesting setting so we went out there and we shot it and lo and behold
[02:43:01.320 --> 02:43:06.120]  people liked it and then I was inspired by what you did with the
[02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:11.760]  Prometheus and also the Hunger Games you know how you analyze the films so you
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:14.320]  know there's a few things I remembered our kids I show the clip from
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:18.760]  Transformers and I remember after I was watching Transformers 3 you know first
[02:43:18.760 --> 02:43:22.680]  time sitting in theater that that just pinged in my head that this guy wants to
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:25.680]  hack into all you know all communications and they also do something
[02:43:25.680 --> 02:43:30.160]  similar in the Avengers movie so it seems like something there they're
[02:43:30.160 --> 02:43:34.280]  kind of pushing this this hack you know your your devices you know these
[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:40.000]  cameras this kind of police state that in the last Batman to where they break
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:44.160]  into all the systems but for the good and they're just letting us know hey we're
[02:43:44.160 --> 02:43:49.640]  really breaking into your devices yeah it's a it's a bit extreme I mean it's
[02:43:49.640 --> 02:43:53.040]  not extreme as far as it couldn't happen it's just extreme and that they are
[02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:58.160]  deploying that kind of a tactic it is well you you won you're getting $5,000
[02:43:58.160 --> 02:44:02.240]  and thank you very much no no no thank you for the great job but here's the
[02:44:02.240 --> 02:44:06.080]  question are you ready to come down here and you know jump in the deep end you
[02:44:06.080 --> 02:44:10.120]  know Alex I want I'm interested in the in the full-time position but I
[02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:13.760]  definitely want to explore all aspects you know I heard you mentioned something
[02:44:13.760 --> 02:44:17.360]  about possibly doing some voice work and you know I just like to look at all
[02:44:17.360 --> 02:44:22.120]  possible you know avenues and aspects before making you know any definite
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:25.200]  decision sure sure I'm just throwing this out on air because I haven't had time
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:29.080]  to call all you folks yet on the phone and Rob do's doing that but I'm telling
[02:44:29.080 --> 02:44:33.040]  you again opportunity when it comes knocking on your door you got to take
[02:44:33.040 --> 02:44:37.960]  it I understand like Obi-Wan Kenobi telling Luke Skywalker you need to come
[02:44:37.960 --> 02:44:42.400]  with me to Alderaan yeah I mean because there's a lot of stuff going on here
[02:44:42.400 --> 02:44:47.080]  and I'm very excited about the work you did and I'd love to have you down there
[02:44:47.080 --> 02:44:50.920]  as a reporter so we definitely have to haggle that out in fact I'll try to call
[02:44:50.920 --> 02:44:55.200]  you sometime next week dual setups or meetings with all over if I could if I
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:45:01.640]  could plug somebody I'm I'm a Dan but Don defend myself we've been sending a
[02:45:01.640 --> 02:45:05.680]  few messages back and forth on YouTube and I got a chance to look at some of
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:10.640]  his other videos and I really like the guy he has a very genuine you know sense
[02:45:10.640 --> 02:45:14.360]  about him his reports are bold they're interesting I like the report he did
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:17.880]  about he did a brief report something about Star Trek or something like that
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:23.080]  it's it's easy he seems like a cool guy and not just him I like Stuart Howell
[02:45:23.080 --> 02:45:27.480]  and David Knight and a bunch of those other guys yeah Stuart Howell's been
[02:45:27.480 --> 02:45:29.800]  calling me I've been so busy I didn't even have time to listen to the messages
[02:45:29.800 --> 02:45:34.160]  I've got to call him I'm gonna set it up next week but here's the deal the
[02:45:34.160 --> 02:45:38.000]  correspondence thing is great and I don't have the money to hire everybody full
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:43.840]  time here the problem is we're so busy we need core people see next phase would
[02:45:43.840 --> 02:45:47.720]  be getting correspondence we need to get four or five people totally trained on
[02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:53.120]  how we do all this so that then they could be above the next level who we
[02:45:53.120 --> 02:45:57.480]  train as correspondence because we're such a small group I don't even have
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:46:00.680]  the reporters most times now to send people to something that's really
[02:46:00.680 --> 02:46:04.840]  important so we're trying to get to that next level and I hope that we can work
[02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:08.040]  something out to get you down here I mean I understand you enter a contest to see
[02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:15.880]  if you can do it now you've won you know there's that big lunch yeah but we
[02:46:15.880 --> 02:46:19.280]  had just looking at the submissions if I could you know just throw a few other
[02:46:19.280 --> 02:46:22.680]  names out there I really like the ladies they had you know some real strong
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:29.040]  ladies you know I got contacted by Melissa and I can't remember I'm pulling
[02:46:29.040 --> 02:46:34.440]  a blank here she was one of the I want to say her name was Mary Moore yes she
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:40.760]  did a very I think she had one of the best as far as production wise no we're
[02:46:40.760 --> 02:46:46.680]  going to we're gonna contact we're gonna contact everybody keep going oh I'm
[02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:52.280]  everybody one on there Dave was it Dave Brickman the guy with the with the
[02:46:52.280 --> 02:46:58.480]  stash mustache oh yeah everybody I mean I really I really like to see you got a
[02:46:58.480 --> 02:47:01.880]  lot of personality and I I mean I don't want to name them all because I know I'm
[02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:07.120]  gonna forget somebody Linda West man just everybody I'm sure a lot of people
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:11.920]  would didn't make the top 10 well again everyone in the top 10 and most people
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:17.040]  the top 20 or so could be great reporters here I was going off of who
[02:47:17.040 --> 02:47:22.800]  overall I think would be the best at interviewing people doing news reports
[02:47:22.800 --> 02:47:27.120]  and things like that and that's why you and Jennifer both won because if I had
[02:47:27.120 --> 02:47:31.560]  to choose blind you know without just stop the videos without interviewing you
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:36.640]  knowing more you guys would be my choice but all the people again that's what
[02:47:36.640 --> 02:47:41.040]  felt so bad about this was that folks were so great everybody was so
[02:47:41.040 --> 02:47:46.160]  wonderful that it was really painful I felt like I was doing something bad not
[02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:50.760]  making everybody first place yeah yeah it's the it's a hard thing to choose
[02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:55.480]  because I had no idea you had 600 plus emissions because I'm sure I was like a
[02:47:55.480 --> 02:47:58.080]  lot of people I'm like when are they gonna announce the winner of the
[02:47:58.080 --> 02:48:01.760]  contest but you know I didn't know you guys were so overwhelmed with the number
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:05.520]  of submissions that you received it was really more than 600 it was it was more
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:09.080]  than sick but do you said the others didn't follow any of the rules but yeah
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:14.840]  we got 600 decent submissions about a hundred really good ones and about 20
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:20.920]  or 30 really fantastic pieces yeah well I'm just glad you guys you know
[02:48:20.920 --> 02:48:24.720]  considered me to be in the top 10 that's such a shock for me you know
[02:48:24.720 --> 02:48:28.440]  somebody to tell me I made the top 10 on Facebook and that's a real surprise for
[02:48:28.440 --> 02:48:31.820]  me and I was like oh okay that's that's cool I remember when you when you
[02:48:31.820 --> 02:48:35.160]  announced that will put me on the top 10 I got a thousand hits on my YouTube page
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:39.240]  overnight which was a big deal for me I know some people got way way more than
[02:48:39.240 --> 02:48:42.720]  that but for me that's a big deal and you know it's gave you know other people
[02:48:42.720 --> 02:48:46.640]  a chance to see what I could do and I'm really am appreciative of you and
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:51.840]  info awards and all the guys down there well I know that obviously Jakari folks
[02:48:51.840 --> 02:48:55.280]  like you and Jennifer had their families their friends you're in Oklahoma
[02:48:55.280 --> 02:49:01.520]  she's up in Ohio but I I hope we can work something out to get you down here
[02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:05.400]  because I'm definitely interested yeah definitely well Oklahoma's a lot closer
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:11.840]  than Ohio to yeah that's true yeah tell us a little bit about yourself well for
[02:49:11.840 --> 02:49:16.680]  me how I kind of got you know I guess quote woken up was back in 2000 I believe
[02:49:16.680 --> 02:49:22.320]  it was seven when I saw the film loose change and up until that time I just kind
[02:49:22.320 --> 02:49:25.040]  of believed you know just whatever I was whatever I was told about you know
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:29.800]  anything and I saw a loose change and you know we can talk about the physics
[02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:33.520]  of a building falling down and and all that stuff but the thing really hit
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:38.480]  hard home for me and the loose change film was just the simple just the
[02:49:38.480 --> 02:49:43.160]  simplicity of the passport of escaping the plane that hit the tower yeah and the
[02:49:43.160 --> 02:49:47.000]  guy was like so it flew out of his pocket missed the fireball landed on
[02:49:47.000 --> 02:49:52.040]  ground but then after a two buildings fell on top of it they found it it is
[02:49:52.040 --> 02:49:56.080]  just the this year common sense of something like that and then after that
[02:49:56.080 --> 02:50:00.560]  you know things with the Pentagon and how they didn't find any wings at the at
[02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:04.320]  the Pentagon and just all that and that kind of opened up you know the kind of
[02:50:04.320 --> 02:50:09.320]  Pandora's box for me which I was I was like a lot of people you know at that
[02:50:09.320 --> 02:50:13.600]  time like okay I mean I move by that I think it can be real but you know what
[02:50:13.600 --> 02:50:18.840]  do I do you know what what can I do what how can I affect change and you know I
[02:50:18.840 --> 02:50:22.720]  kind of sat on it for a little bit you know I was I see things here and there
[02:50:22.720 --> 02:50:26.000]  that you know kind of woke me up and I go back to sleep and woke me up and went
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.600]  back to sleep and then just eventually it kind of got to the point I guess I
[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:35.080]  started listening to your show regularly back in 2010 you know I've seen all the
[02:50:35.080 --> 02:50:40.600]  stuff that you guys do and all the great guys I love Gerald Salente and just
[02:50:40.600 --> 02:50:43.520]  seeing all the stuff you do and it's real inspiring to me so that kind of
[02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:48.200]  pushed me to jacari Jackson you inspire us come back because I have a word of

[02:56:35.520 --> 02:56:38.880]  you know went down and turned a camera on the light and was talking about you
[02:56:38.880 --> 02:56:44.640]  know the New World Order 17 years ago so we're here to develop raw talent I
[02:56:44.640 --> 02:56:48.880]  mean Aaron Dykes I mean he's got a degree in journalism and stuff or is it
[02:56:48.880 --> 02:56:52.960]  political science from UT also film school but you know he'll tell you he
[02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:57.800]  really learned everything here because I mean this is the real world and so this
[02:56:57.800 --> 02:57:01.840]  is being thrown into the deep end you learn to swim really fast so I think
[02:57:01.840 --> 02:57:04.920]  it's a great opportunity but it's also important you know you could get into it
[02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:09.040]  slow or something be a correspondent for a while finish getting your degree I just
[02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:12.640]  hope there's a country at the end of it because things are moving quickly yeah
[02:57:12.640 --> 02:57:17.680]  that's true it's every time I look around it seems like the police state is
[02:57:17.680 --> 02:57:21.240]  just getting you know a little bit more aggressive I remember I was reading the
[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:24.320]  article I believe it's in Colorado Springs late where they're gonna start
[02:57:24.320 --> 02:57:29.760]  wearing a full ride gear at all times even doing traffic stops yes I saw that
[02:57:29.760 --> 02:57:34.080]  it's getting and France is gonna put breathalysers in all the cars oh I miss
[02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:39.000]  that one it's amazing well here's one more point about it just for any media
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:42.400]  people out there in my experience getting a degree is fine but it's
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:46.500]  something like media it's changing so fast what matters in media is that you
[02:57:46.500 --> 02:57:52.040]  get that first job or that you become a reporter and show what you can do that's
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:55.520]  why I mean take somebody I'm not trying to sell you guys the point is take somebody
[02:57:55.520 --> 02:57:59.640]  like Jennifer she's getting her you know her her masters her PhD in acting in
[02:57:59.640 --> 02:58:03.920]  theater well believe me what matters is not just having a degree and that's great
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:08.160]  shows you have dedication it's actually getting on the air it's actually doing
[02:58:08.160 --> 02:58:12.800]  it that's what people look at it's called getting your big break jacquard
[02:58:12.800 --> 02:58:18.760]  yeah I realized that because I saw the video with us lente white colleges a
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:22.360]  scam and they're really kind of questioned some of the aspects I had of
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:25.920]  some of the thoughts I had about education so I mean I definitely agree
[02:58:25.920 --> 02:58:28.520]  with what you're saying it's not just about having a piece of papers you know
[02:58:28.520 --> 02:58:32.720]  can you go out there and perform so I definitely hear you're out on that hey
