[00:00.000 --> 00:07.360]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[00:07.360 --> 00:30.520]  a war on for your mind.
[00:30.520 --> 00:39.480]  Here in the broadcast yesterday I went to DrudgeReport.com and there was this image
[00:39.480 --> 00:47.160]  of Hillary Clinton the glowing goddess and I started reading news articles about it and
[00:47.160 --> 00:52.240]  the more I looked at it and the more I read the transcript of what she said in her little
[00:52.240 --> 00:58.640]  victory speech, the more it was emblematic of how they are selling her as if she is
[00:58.640 --> 01:07.360]  messianic and I noticed that CNN literally added a golden filter to her and made her
[01:07.360 --> 01:16.240]  shine like a god and then blurred out the background and then like Sauron in the last
[01:16.240 --> 01:22.000]  of the Hobbit trilogy burns with flame.
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.480]  It is bizarre and it's completely and totally emblematic of how they are selling her as
[01:28.480 --> 01:29.480]  the savior.
[01:29.480 --> 01:36.380]  I remember when we have clips of my film the Obama deception made eight years ago or seven
[01:36.380 --> 01:42.360]  and a half years ago they were calling him the Messiah or the black Jesus and then he
[01:42.360 --> 01:49.280]  was going to deliver everyone all he did was well under his tutelage double black unemployment
[01:49.280 --> 01:55.400]  the rate it had previously been so as I've said if that is any indication of what Herr
[01:55.400 --> 02:02.720]  Hillary is going to be doing to women just get ready because they know they've got you,
[02:02.720 --> 02:08.160]  they know you're drooling over it, you've been told that when she wins you win.
[02:08.160 --> 02:11.800]  You don't win in your own life when you're successful, you don't win in your own life
[02:11.800 --> 02:16.000]  when your family is successful, you don't win in your own life when your nation is successful,
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.600]  you don't win in your own life when the infant mortality rate goes down, it's actually exploding.
[02:21.600 --> 02:29.640]  No, you win in your life when someone else that Hollywood and the spend machine has told
[02:29.640 --> 02:36.520]  you is a God who is a savior.
[02:36.520 --> 02:42.560]  When they have great success you supposedly live vicariously through them and this is
[02:42.560 --> 02:47.280]  the very nature historically of cults.
[02:47.280 --> 02:55.120]  I've misplaced my paper newsbusters of the folks that first pointed it out CNN depicts
[02:55.120 --> 03:02.800]  history making close quote Hillary Clinton as a quote golden God as they said she looked
[03:02.800 --> 03:08.080]  like a golden God and of course they're the ones that added the filter to it as we went
[03:08.080 --> 03:13.480]  to the DNC video I'm gonna be filing a special report for the nightly news on this tonight
[03:13.480 --> 03:18.080]  maybe we'll even do it later live on the radio slash TV show here but the real feed that
[03:18.080 --> 03:25.000]  didn't happen they just premeditated this with her in this Princess Leah goddess outfit
[03:25.000 --> 03:32.760]  a.k.a. Joseph Campbell the archetypal goddess but that's not Princess Leah there ladies
[03:32.760 --> 03:40.700]  and gentlemen that's more like Emperor Palpatine and drag and then she just I've been leads
[03:40.700 --> 03:48.200]  back receiving it like out of some cult movie false to doom and is a mountain of power go
[03:48.200 --> 03:57.800]  forth my children the day of doom is at hand go out into the world and burn it with a great
[03:57.800 --> 04:07.280]  cleansing of Hillary on the great goddess cleanse the earth with blood our sacred goddess
[04:07.280 --> 04:17.360]  of death Kali I mean this is like something out of a science fiction slash horror film
[04:17.360 --> 04:29.760]  where they're electing a cult demon anti-Christ Linda Blair complete with I can't even do
[04:29.760 --> 04:48.000]  it I can try to make those evil smile I can't I can't catch it when she leers down and goes
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.120]  we'll be back with our new Lord and Savior Timber we want to welcome our Lord and Savior
[04:53.120 --> 05:00.840]  Timber I remember Jamie Foxx well now this is even this is even more disgusting the Constitutional
[05:00.840 --> 05:05.800]  Convention 1787 was held strict secrecy and at the end of the proceeding citizens gathered
[05:05.800 --> 05:09.840]  outside Independence Hall to learn what had been produced behind closed doors while Benjamin
[05:09.840 --> 05:14.240]  Franklin was leaving the hall a lady asked him well doctor what have we got a republic
[05:14.240 --> 05:19.280]  or a monarchy to which he responded a republic if you can keep it but today not only have
[05:19.280 --> 05:23.360]  we lost a republic but most people don't even know what a republic even is for one thing
[05:23.360 --> 05:27.840]  a republic is not a democracy the republic operates under the rule law which protects
[05:27.840 --> 05:31.520]  individual liberties so that the majority cannot take away the rights of the minority
[05:31.520 --> 05:35.720]  under a public the government and its citizens all by by the same laws regardless of political
[05:35.720 --> 05:39.880]  power or lack thereof democracy on the other hand only leads the mob rule fueled by the
[05:39.880 --> 05:44.160]  unrestrained whims of the public in a democracy the individual or any groups of individuals
[05:44.160 --> 05:48.120]  composing the minority have no protection against the unlimited power of the majority
[05:48.120 --> 05:52.440]  it is a case of majority over man in other words under democracy two wolves can vote
[05:52.440 --> 05:56.280]  to eat the sheep for dinner but under a republic the sheep's right to life is protected by
[05:56.280 --> 06:01.760]  the rule of law this is Kit Daniels with info wars dot com introducing vitamin mineral

[08:30.520 --> 09:00.480]  oh my gosh it's in CNBC today it's in the london guardian today it's the london independent
[09:00.480 --> 09:08.080]  today it's in a whole bunch of other u.s. newspapers it's crazy ten years ago when drugs report
[09:08.080 --> 09:16.960]  dot com started linking to info wars dot com articles with photos and videos of helicopters
[09:16.960 --> 09:24.920]  marines army you name it guarding belterberg group meetings here in the u.s. and overseas
[09:24.920 --> 09:31.160]  and drudge linked to it the quote mainstream media that is the decepticon state run globalist
[09:31.160 --> 09:40.200]  run media the dinosaur media now the on its last legs media the hanging on by its fingernails
[09:40.200 --> 09:46.240]  media they came out and said matt drudge has gone over the edge he's gone completely insane
[09:46.240 --> 09:55.040]  he's over because he would dare linked info wars dot com and the schizophrenic beliefs
[09:55.040 --> 10:03.840]  of alex jones the new york times came out and said eight years ago at this very time
[10:03.840 --> 10:09.040]  of year when obama and hillary were caught secretly meeting in the belterberg meeting
[10:09.040 --> 10:15.320]  where she decided to step down and quit contesting the new york times you can go read the article
[10:15.320 --> 10:22.320]  said that i was having a full-on schizophrenic event that i was mentally ill at a marriott
[10:22.320 --> 10:27.920]  conference center in chantilly virginia and was imagining men in black sunglasses and
[10:27.920 --> 10:34.200]  suits and cars following us we just all had it on tape them detaining us helicopters check
[10:34.200 --> 10:39.040]  point secret service with submachine guns pointing the matters as they drove by all
[10:39.040 --> 10:46.280]  of it on hd video even eight years ago and they said it didn't exist of course now the
[10:46.280 --> 10:50.200]  last four or five they've had to admit it exists but make fun of it now if you read
[10:50.200 --> 10:55.480]  the articles they say they control europe they don't want to allow the briggs it the british
[10:55.480 --> 11:00.840]  exit from the euro they want to destroy trump they want a planetary regime and a global carbon
[11:00.840 --> 11:10.720]  tax and to censor the internet wow and dredge reports bigger than ever undisputed number
[11:10.720 --> 11:16.920]  one news aggregate site in the world with more news traffic than facebook and the new
[11:16.920 --> 11:25.200]  york times combined and facebook has over two billion users thousands of articles later
[11:25.200 --> 11:30.000]  dredge report they said was failed and gone and now they don't even try to deny the fact
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.800]  that it's dominant and i harp on dredge report because it's axiomatic it's it's it's a telltale
[11:34.800 --> 11:39.760]  sign a bellwether a gauge emblematic like when you talk about a search engine you called
[11:39.760 --> 11:46.000]  it google you still do i'm gonna google it well i'm gonna drudge it it just means your
[11:46.000 --> 11:51.040]  establishment talking points that up is down and down is up and black is white and mothers
[11:51.040 --> 11:57.200]  and fathers are bad and private property is evil we don't follow mark zuckerberg my users
[11:57.200 --> 12:03.520]  are dumb efforts talking points we don't let you set the trends drudge doesn't even so
[12:03.520 --> 12:10.200]  much at the trends but gets the global populist trend that's already out there and then adds
[12:10.200 --> 12:16.440]  his overall lens to it because it's what drudge is looking at what he's interested in and
[12:16.440 --> 12:23.120]  that resonates with the general population of the world because it's synced up with them
[12:23.120 --> 12:27.240]  it's a mine mill see that's how that works same thing with them for wars dot com or prison
[12:27.240 --> 12:31.040]  planet dot com these are things i'm concerned with these are things my crew is concerned
[12:31.040 --> 12:34.640]  with i don't even tell my crew nine times out of ten what to go do or what to cover
[12:34.640 --> 12:39.000]  they instinctively get it their people i hired because they were already out fighting the
[12:39.000 --> 12:45.280]  new world order they were already aware they were already listeners you don't have to see
[12:45.280 --> 12:48.960]  my world view it's like if you're driving along through the mountains and you know in
[12:48.960 --> 12:54.000]  switzerland and a train and look at the matterhorn you're all looking at the matterhorn together
[12:54.000 --> 12:58.000]  it's not like you're seeing what i told you to see i'm saying hey look out this window
[12:58.000 --> 13:04.120]  over here zuckerberg wants us to look into some bag that we put over our head and then
[13:04.120 --> 13:11.880]  he controls the stimulus inside the bag literally he wants you sitting there like a gorilla you
[13:11.880 --> 13:17.680]  know with a virtual reality hood over your head like a guantanamo bay prisoner as he
[13:17.680 --> 13:25.480]  walks bipedally past you in your face and i'm like you know what i think i'm gonna look
[13:25.480 --> 13:31.320]  around for myself that's all i'm doing is hey look around for yourself hey oh look our
[13:31.320 --> 13:37.840]  reporters and other reporters got detained really arrested put in vans others got drug
[13:37.840 --> 13:46.520]  away because they dared to be in the middle of dresden germany videotaping world leaders
[13:46.520 --> 13:58.160]  arriving at the secret confab but that's only adds gravy to the turkey in them and the dressing
[13:58.160 --> 14:03.000]  in the potatoes in the cranberry sauce that we're exposing these people but see they still
[14:03.000 --> 14:08.880]  just don't get it go out and have the police arrest people act like thugs because nice
[14:08.880 --> 14:13.800]  friendly journalists are out talking to germans on the street and pointing out what's going
[14:13.800 --> 14:21.480]  on inside yes toady up toady up to the shadowy room that doesn't exist that the establishment
[14:21.480 --> 14:26.880]  media told us forever didn't exist just like they always told us one person one vote and
[14:26.880 --> 14:30.640]  then they told us oh it's never been like that actually the sovereign party that's a
[14:30.640 --> 14:37.080]  quote from george will will decide not you that didn't fly but i predicted that even
[14:37.080 --> 14:42.800]  though they would say he was the presumptive nominee that as soon as he clearly clenched
[14:42.800 --> 14:46.920]  it they would come back with new scandals and claim he must stand down that's the new
[14:46.920 --> 14:53.120]  drum beat last night this morning on cnn fox you name it is that donald trump got even
[14:53.120 --> 14:56.600]  more delegates than he thought but and he's brought in a record number of 13 million
[14:56.600 --> 15:11.040]  votes we just saw the last election with how many in 2012 10 million flat for met romney
[15:11.040 --> 15:17.440]  three million more record number but none of that matters because oh william crystal
[15:17.440 --> 15:21.480]  says at the weekly standard that he's going to run a third party even though that's failed
[15:21.480 --> 15:25.520]  they cut to weekly standard reporter and he goes into a ten minute diatribe this morning
[15:25.520 --> 15:28.960]  about how horrible trump is and how he's a failure and how embarrassing he is and then
[15:28.960 --> 15:34.120]  an exclusive interview that american psycho bill hammer not saying he's actually a psycho
[15:34.120 --> 15:40.880]  he just looks like the actor met with governor casick and governor casick arrogantly said
[15:40.880 --> 15:45.120]  i don't think i'm going to allow him to be the nominee we're going to stand against him
[15:45.120 --> 15:52.840]  as i've always said we are because he's the head of the rnc at the convention and then
[15:52.840 --> 16:00.880]  the whole show and then the next show is all about how these these republicans real conservatives
[16:00.880 --> 16:09.320]  george w bush herbert walker bush rhino neocon warmongering anti-gun knuckle dragon tyrants
[16:09.320 --> 16:16.360]  on a set up there and say we don't endorse him so that's it and we're not even gonna
[16:16.360 --> 16:23.640]  give him the money and we'd rather have hillary because they know donald trump's a nationalist
[16:23.640 --> 16:27.880]  and i found a video i say found has like 600 000 views we're gonna post info wars dot
[16:27.880 --> 16:31.880]  com the next 15 20 minutes i'ma tweet it out it's like 30 minutes long i'm gonna put
[16:31.880 --> 16:35.520]  the first four or five minutes at the bottom of the hour that shows donald trump going
[16:35.520 --> 16:42.320]  back 30 years talking about nationalism how america's getting screwed over by globalism
[16:42.320 --> 16:47.160]  how these trade deals are one sided how he doesn't want to run for president but that
[16:47.160 --> 16:52.520]  he'd like to find leadership that's willing to stand up to make this country great again
[16:52.520 --> 16:59.120]  how he's a not an east coast republican but a populist republican and i gotta be honest
[16:59.120 --> 17:03.960]  with you i'd read these statements and books he wrote back in the early 90s and the 2000s
[17:03.960 --> 17:08.760]  but i'd never actually seen him say it and boy they ought to put out campaign ads with
[17:08.760 --> 17:18.840]  this stuff because he looks so sincere in these film clubs but we see him sincerely
[17:18.840 --> 17:22.400]  taking the globalist on and that's why they're so scared of him they're scared of him both
[17:22.400 --> 17:27.920]  political machines for a good reason because they've hijacked this nation in the world
[17:27.920 --> 17:33.480]  he's coming along and saying hey you're not going to run the scam anymore i'm coming in
[17:33.480 --> 17:39.120]  to try to bust this up now whether he's going to be successful or not they are in a tizzy
[17:39.120 --> 17:46.000]  because they have hijacked this country they've stolen it and they don't like anybody claiming
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.240]  that when a bunch of hyenas have taken down a wilder beast and in and in and up comes
[17:50.240 --> 17:54.240]  walking a lion they don't know whether he wants to free the wilder beast or eat the
[17:54.240 --> 17:59.840]  wilder beast all they know is he's coming in on what something they think is theirs
[17:59.840 --> 18:05.160]  and if the american people don't know that the establishment is your enemy the establishment
[18:05.160 --> 18:09.200]  is not everything it can to make you dependent and controlled and sold off your birthright
[18:09.200 --> 18:14.040]  of freedom and the industries you built your forebears built and tried to turn us into
[18:14.040 --> 18:21.720]  domesticated drooling slobs if you don't realize that and turn against the globalist
[18:21.720 --> 18:27.560]  you're a fool and i'm talking to new listeners we noticed in the last week videos and articles
[18:27.560 --> 18:35.560]  and reports of ebt digital food stamp cards not working and drudge last week linked to
[18:35.560 --> 18:40.000]  this particularly viral video maybe it was monday of this woman just ransacking a grocery
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.400]  store and just freaking out and screaming because her ebt card won't work and darn it
[18:44.400 --> 18:49.200]  it's time for her to get the money we've always talked about that a few weeks of ebt cards
[18:49.200 --> 18:54.680]  uh not working that all hell would break loose well they are now reporting that all over
[18:54.680 --> 19:01.160]  the country ebt cards are up to two weeks behind getting reloaded and that's because
[19:01.160 --> 19:12.600]  folks we are teetering on the edge of total collapse and when you've got a hundred million
[19:12.600 --> 19:19.760]  people who don't work that's conservative and they are entitled and they weigh four hundred
[19:19.760 --> 19:25.320]  and fifty five hundred pounds a piece and i'm just pointing out can you imagine can
[19:25.320 --> 19:30.760]  you imagine an army of four hundred pound people that are so infantile when their card
[19:30.760 --> 19:37.320]  doesn't work they start throwing fits like a toddler and you know in this case you got
[19:37.320 --> 19:41.160]  black people throwing a black lady out who's going crazy imagine what that was white people

[24:34.160 --> 24:41.840]  lost control of their deception three days ago drudge began linking to info wars dot
[24:41.840 --> 24:48.280]  com articles every day for three days in a row monday tuesday wednesday linking to
[24:48.280 --> 24:57.520]  paul joseph watson and other articles with exclusive intel on bill berg with the headlines

[25:03.720 --> 25:09.400]  to keep britain from exiting the euro we have actual sources and then of course bill berg
[25:09.400 --> 25:13.480]  puts out its own press release we grab that first put it out drudge linked to it mainstream
[25:13.480 --> 25:23.640]  media ignored it on monday tuesday and wednesday okay remember drudge top linked it then today
[25:23.640 --> 25:28.440]  it's in the london independent CNBC and a bunch of other publications and look at the
[25:28.440 --> 25:35.320]  headline world planners meet boy you know if top world golfers met you'd be big news
[25:35.320 --> 25:43.720]  if top hollywood stars met of top scientists met but but world planners meet brexit migrants
[25:43.720 --> 25:51.240]  trump on menu reporters chased away oh i didn't i just since i just looked he just added an
[25:51.240 --> 26:00.440]  info wars link so because that's newsworthy yeah they got detained some got arrested paul
[26:00.440 --> 26:05.800]  joseph watson so that's how fast drudge moves this is a microcosm example so see drudge
[26:05.800 --> 26:11.760]  ten years ago breaks the blockade sure jim tucker info wars we were all reporting on
[26:11.760 --> 26:17.520]  it daniel estalin others but breaking the blockade in the us was drudge just showing
[26:17.520 --> 26:21.600]  how it's a facade and now ten years later they've got to admit okay there's a secret
[26:21.600 --> 26:27.520]  government world government meeting okay yes george soros is involved yes they want a hundred
[26:27.520 --> 26:32.920]  trillion in global taxes every decade paid to them and yes they want to tax the internet
[26:32.920 --> 26:38.200]  and control it and yes they want to open the borders up and yes they want to kick donald
[26:38.200 --> 26:50.120]  trump out and oh gawker and the white house run media matters brock can say tinfoil hat
[26:50.120 --> 26:56.040]  and kook all they want but the london guardian one of the most respected papers in the world
[26:56.040 --> 27:03.400]  the financial times of london very respected by the establishment cnbc london independent
[27:03.400 --> 27:08.440]  all of them have to go okay world leaders are meeting in secret and then when they go
[27:08.440 --> 27:13.560]  back to their parliaments and of their and of their congresses and of their boondestogs
[27:13.560 --> 27:17.680]  they get asked what'd you do what happened in lawsuits started people are removed from
[27:17.680 --> 27:22.240]  office and then england goes wait a minute ninety percent of our laws are made by e u
[27:22.240 --> 27:26.640]  bureaucrats they're unelected we want out how many years that i hammered that the uk
[27:26.640 --> 27:30.280]  was part of bill de bergen we'd have lord mongton on we'd travel there and lord mongton
[27:30.280 --> 27:39.360]  would even travel we made it an issue it became the issue and we're winning so when
[27:39.360 --> 27:43.240]  i get up here and brag about what info wars is done or what drudge is done it's not about
[27:43.240 --> 27:49.320]  us it's it's about a war and do you want to live under multinational unelected corporations
[27:49.320 --> 27:54.360]  that just do whatever they want and then have a bunch of weirdos in paid off so-called media
[27:54.360 --> 28:01.240]  sit there in big fancy sets and laugh at you and go build a burger can i get cheese and
[28:01.240 --> 28:07.720]  onions on that i've probably been on radio and tv shows two hundred plus times where
[28:07.720 --> 28:15.000]  they said can i have a cheese on that burger and i'm like wow that's really original that
[28:15.000 --> 28:19.160]  is so amazing you know when i got arrested in canada and they said they were gonna put
[28:19.160 --> 28:25.960]  in a toronto prison for fifteen hours until the media showed up there weren't any cheese
[28:25.960 --> 28:31.720]  burgers there i was just trying to cover bill de bergen but the good news is all the intimidation
[28:31.720 --> 28:40.800]  all the all the demonization hasn't worked it's blown up in their face the problem is
[28:40.800 --> 28:48.160]  speaking of drudge report dot com is that drudge again is linking to zero hedge great
[28:48.160 --> 28:53.440]  folks and our own michael snider the problem is the mainstream media is not reporting on
[28:53.440 --> 29:00.680]  it yet ebt card outage it's been two weeks in some areas it's up to eight days in some
[29:00.680 --> 29:08.240]  major cities widespread glitches flashback video woman trashes store after food stamps
[29:08.240 --> 29:16.960]  refused and you watch the chilling video that said up at drudge report dot com on the right
[29:16.960 --> 29:22.160]  hand side and you can see this woman flipping out a few days ago when her car didn't work
[29:22.160 --> 29:27.200]  and this is happening all over the country she doesn't know how to do anything her whole
[29:27.200 --> 29:31.600]  life she's been on welfare her whole life she sits there and watches Oprah Winfrey where's
[29:31.600 --> 29:37.600]  her free car i love this woman i mean i'm sad for her she's like a giant 450 pound toddler
[29:37.600 --> 29:43.200]  she's totally deranged and she's acting like a three-year-old just like paul watson said
[29:43.200 --> 29:48.880]  social justice warriors are arrested development fools that think they're high tech intellectuals
[29:48.880 --> 29:56.240]  because they watch mr madow the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.160 --> 30:04.880]  amazon's jeff bezos and other billionaires have been developing space infrastructure
[30:04.880 --> 30:11.040]  technology since the year 2000 for elon musk a rocket ship to space is the ultimate bug out bag
[30:11.040 --> 30:17.360]  for an emergency escape to the galaxy's most expensive bunker a colony on mars but amazon's
[30:17.360 --> 30:23.840]  bezos is implementing his lifelong dream of colonies in space future generations of entrepreneurs
[30:24.480 --> 30:30.480]  can have a solar system is dynamic and interesting and varied as what we see on the internet today
[30:30.480 --> 30:36.720]  i think you go to space to save us luxury playgrounds for a few ultra elite who are
[30:36.720 --> 30:42.880]  astronomically wealthy so who would have a monopoly on manufacturing and energy by controlling the most
[30:42.880 --> 30:48.080]  valuable real estate in the galaxy the earth and moon lagrangian points that would be the

[31:01.280 --> 31:07.840]  thousands of years ago there was a basic form of chivalry our ancestors would hear the drums of war

[31:14.240 --> 31:20.640]  when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they had drums of their own air raid
[31:20.640 --> 31:27.520]  sirens but in the 21st century there are silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food

[33:54.560 --> 33:58.720]  for you they've got the votes now to enforce copyright law you're out of there they're gonna
[33:58.720 --> 34:03.600]  make it so headlines you can't even use headlines to have a supreme court justice say that to my
[34:03.600 --> 34:10.000]  face that it's over they've got the votes which means time is limited time is not forever how
[34:10.000 --> 34:16.080]  many more moons and sunrises will you see in your life uh rise and fall there's not that many
[34:16.080 --> 34:21.760]  it's a small amount so for people to be saying with this attitude oh i'll get on with my life

[34:28.480 --> 34:34.720]  they admit you can't put a headline to the new york times you're sending massive traffic to them
[34:34.720 --> 34:40.240]  they're claiming you're taking their words this is insane and you had the justice steven bryer said
[34:40.240 --> 34:45.280]  we need to look at a global law now remember just recently getting lined up with it so they're getting
[34:45.280 --> 34:49.680]  ready for these decisions to come you thought obama care was shocking you thought some of these
[34:49.680 --> 34:55.040]  other decisions were shocking wait until these copyright laws work their way up and the supreme
[34:55.040 --> 35:01.600]  court decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across the board
[35:04.240 --> 35:12.080]  waging war on corruption it's alex joe coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[35:12.080 --> 35:20.400]  i'm going to make more of those vignettes jaren mcgrain put that little two and a half minute
[35:20.400 --> 35:24.400]  piece together for one drudge visitors last year it's like a 45 minute long interview with just
[35:24.400 --> 35:28.480]  more little nuggets of what he talked about 10 months ago that now unfortunately all of it's
[35:28.480 --> 35:33.040]  coming through and that's because drudge obviously has a lot of high-level contacts but he can also
[35:33.760 --> 35:39.360]  obviously see what's happening as he follows the news for 18 hours a day as we do and so can other
[35:39.360 --> 35:44.640]  people around the world we're just pointing out common sense things here that everybody already
[35:44.640 --> 35:52.720]  instinctively knows but we're letting everybody know you're not alone msnbc cnn all these channels
[35:52.720 --> 35:58.880]  they're about making you think you're alone ha these races don't want obama care hey this subsection
[35:58.880 --> 36:04.720]  says it doubles and dribbles prices shut up racist well actually uh i just want to you know keep my
[36:04.720 --> 36:11.520]  health care shut up well it says here i'm gonna lose my doctor no it doesn't yeah read the subsection
[36:11.520 --> 36:16.000]  groupers like thank god they're so stupid that they never actually read the subsections we can
[36:16.000 --> 36:24.960]  screw them over they go on c span and say you're dumb zuckerberg says you're dumb
[36:27.120 --> 36:30.000]  well there may be a large portion of the population that isn't a coma
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.360]  but just because they're going along with it doesn't mean you have a right to screw me over
[36:36.000 --> 36:42.320]  in a pure democracy 51 can vote to rob the other 49 to enslave them whatever
[36:43.360 --> 36:48.560]  in a republic there are basic rights that the majority cannot vote to take away the
[36:48.560 --> 36:54.160]  minorities freedoms they've got a so obsessed with what skin color we've got or where we came from
[36:54.160 --> 37:01.840]  being the only rights or things that are involved as a general human species it's in the news every
[37:01.840 --> 37:06.720]  day that they're building a world with robots replacing us people say fine i'll just sit around all
[37:06.720 --> 37:14.880]  day if it isn't a world built by humans for humans maintained by humans we will be obsolete
[37:14.880 --> 37:20.640]  obsolescent even if the social engineers and this is profound don't want to get rid of us
[37:20.640 --> 37:28.080]  yes we will be like 500 pound creatures in the movie walley floating on a galactic cruise ship
[37:28.080 --> 37:34.960]  already dehumanized but guess what the elite art going to let us just sit here and operate
[37:38.400 --> 37:46.240]  like jellyfish the decision has been made to hasten our decline to hasten our slouching
[37:46.240 --> 37:54.400]  into obsolescence and to have an organized incremental phasing out of homo sapien sapien
[37:56.960 --> 38:02.720]  and that's what every white paper every wired magazine futurist report every ray kerswell
[38:02.720 --> 38:05.200]  google board member statement says
[38:07.520 --> 38:11.520]  in fact there was like four articles yesterday two or three the day before that five or six
[38:11.520 --> 38:16.240]  the day before that i had my stack in the technology stack that i meant to get to it i'm like you
[38:16.240 --> 38:21.600]  know i've already said this five thousand times why read them saying it again exactly as i told
[38:21.600 --> 38:27.760]  you they would do because i was only quoting them previously it's like how they're saying exactly
[38:27.760 --> 38:33.200]  what alex said on the news today that's because they've gone from the board rooms and the drawing
[38:33.200 --> 38:39.520]  rooms when i was telling you this stuff 20 years ago off white papers and freaking out to now putting
[38:39.520 --> 38:46.560]  it on tv because they're getting ready to go operational and that's what's scary global
[38:46.560 --> 38:52.400]  financial taxes phasing out of cash you'll still have cash that will be digitally marked and track
[38:52.400 --> 38:59.920]  its whole history cash is going to be like credit cards you know all tracked the police will just
[38:59.920 --> 39:05.440]  drive by and grab money right out of your credit card or debit card i saw that on the drawing
[39:05.440 --> 39:10.640]  more years ago it's now being done covered that yesterday in fact that's so unbelievable let me
[39:10.640 --> 39:16.720]  give you the headline now this is oklahoma 9 tv oklahoma highway patrol uses new devices
[39:16.720 --> 39:22.000]  sees money used during the commission of a crime that's the whitewash article today the
[39:22.000 --> 39:26.720]  newspaper headline we guys give me yesterday's article was more hardcore it was like in new
[39:26.720 --> 39:31.280]  asset forfeiture seizure police are going to take money directly out of your debit card from a distance
[39:31.280 --> 39:37.840]  you may have heard of civil asset forfeiture that's where police can seize your property and cash
[39:37.840 --> 39:43.760]  without first proving you committed a crime oh guilty until never proven innocent without a warrant
[39:43.760 --> 39:48.720]  and without arresting you as long as they suspect that your property is somehow tied to the crime
[39:49.360 --> 39:53.440]  that is so unconstitutional they've had it since the 80s it's under the letter of mark
[39:53.440 --> 39:57.760]  it's the really big bad evil thing the police are involved in but what they do is they cut the
[39:57.760 --> 40:03.440]  funding to the point where the police can only operate off of asset forfeiture they got federal
[40:03.440 --> 40:07.920]  laws passed for the states can't keep the money unless they go through a federal program that up
[40:07.920 --> 40:13.920]  to 85% goes back hence federalizing police that's the other big secret now the oklahoma highway
[40:13.920 --> 40:20.320]  patrol has a device that also allows them to seize money in your bank account or on prepaid cards
[40:20.320 --> 40:25.600]  that's right no judge no jury we just are going to grab money off your debit card it's called
[40:25.600 --> 40:32.960]  e-rad or electronic recovery and access data machine and state police began using 16 of them last
[40:32.960 --> 40:41.040]  month here's how it works if a trooper suspects you may have money tied to some type of crime oh
[40:41.040 --> 40:45.920]  this the trooper who needs a judge who needs a jury who needs a grand jury who needs an indictment
[40:45.920 --> 40:55.760]  who needs a GA here's how it works see on news 9 reports like it's fun here's how it works you
[40:55.760 --> 40:59.040]  stick your head in the guillotine they pull the switch in a big giant razor blade falls out and
[40:59.040 --> 41:04.240]  chops your heads off it's so much fun oh i'm sorry here's ABC News last week it's wonderful every
[41:04.240 --> 41:08.800]  troublesome of a microchip you know it's coming those are that's a quote here's how it works
[41:08.800 --> 41:15.600]  if a trooper suspects you may have money tied to some type of crime the highway patrol can scan any
[41:15.600 --> 41:23.040]  cards you have for and seize the money you mean he just suspects or she suspects and remember all
[41:23.040 --> 41:27.840]  the news reports about different areas of the country where the corrupt police pull you over
[41:27.840 --> 41:32.800]  and it's an old lady with three grand in her wallet in her purse and the cops just take it
[41:33.360 --> 41:39.280]  and then the local judge goes well we tested the money and some of the bills had cocaine on it
[41:39.280 --> 41:45.680]  almost all money that's been circulated has drugs on it that's known that's our proof and they'll
[41:45.680 --> 41:51.840]  tell the old lady you let us have the three grand or we're taking your Cadillac and most of them just
[41:51.840 --> 41:57.600]  go uh uh because you know old ladies are smart and don't keep all their money in the bank because
[41:57.600 --> 42:04.400]  they live through the great depression how police took 53 000 from a christian band an orphanage in
[42:04.400 --> 42:09.360]  a church you know i'm not anti police themselves individually because i know there's a whole sorrow
[42:09.360 --> 42:14.800]  scapegoat the police so they can federalize them but this asset for which are seizure and the irs
[42:14.800 --> 42:19.360]  grabbing money out of accounts with no due process and now saying oh we're not going to let you
[42:19.360 --> 42:24.560]  leave the country if we're investigating you or now you can't get on a plane if we're investigating
[42:24.560 --> 42:32.320]  you now they want that this is so totalitarian you know here's my problem i've got like 200
[42:32.320 --> 42:37.840]  articles and they're all just this insane and i've got this powerful donald trump video on a
[42:37.840 --> 42:45.360]  play and i've got loaded guest on loaded guest you know and i almost don't want to be presumptive
[42:45.360 --> 42:52.720]  about the trump campaign but the truth is we're in the zeitgeist of the trump campaign and it
[42:52.720 --> 42:58.000]  obviously trump talks about enforcers on the campaign trail almost every day our fans are out there
[42:58.000 --> 43:04.240]  here he gets briefings with our info kori luandowski constantly tries to block it and speaks out
[43:04.240 --> 43:11.040]  against me and says oh gosh don't go on that show um and then sure we like to get trump on but it's
[43:11.040 --> 43:18.000]  not that big a deal breaking big news is what's a big deal but it is good to see you know you
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.800]  you heard roger stoner state he goes let me just say i'm smiling with a chess shower cat smile right
[43:22.800 --> 43:29.200]  now because trump is back on the offensive what that means is he's back listening to stone
[43:33.760 --> 43:37.920]  and i was told last week on air you were told and i was told over the weekend
[43:38.480 --> 43:43.440]  by larry nickles that uh he was talking to the high level folks in the trump campaign that they
[43:43.440 --> 43:49.040]  wanted to have the info relayed over this show so it was recorded and so they could give it to trump
[43:49.040 --> 43:53.760]  and he's giving me a lot of good tips over the years but it was just like really larry
[43:54.640 --> 43:58.720]  every week you're going to come on and speak directly to them and he goes well they're preparing
[43:58.720 --> 44:02.880]  something in a week and a half and he's going to have a big speech on it and he talked about it
[44:03.840 --> 44:08.400]  about hillary and and the latest crimes and he's one of the top experts on that
[44:09.120 --> 44:12.240]  you know behind the clinton chronicles and so much more and i then knew he was telling the truth
[44:12.240 --> 44:16.800]  but i was just like okay larry but we've already told everybody all this he says well that's how
[44:16.800 --> 44:22.320]  they want it relayed and then sure enough trump comes out you're staying goes for two days ago
[44:22.320 --> 44:28.000]  his victory speech and goes uh next week probably next monday i'm gonna have a major speech on the
[44:28.000 --> 44:34.080]  crimes of hillary and nickles said that a week ago so i mean i know nickles is telling the truth
[44:34.080 --> 44:40.800]  it's just it's kind of unreal to be in the zeitgeist at that level it's not like a power trip
[44:40.800 --> 44:46.560]  it's it's it's it's actually kind of the responsibility of it is
[44:49.760 --> 44:51.120]  overwhelming is the word
[44:53.600 --> 44:54.720]  i mean i feel overwhelmed
[44:56.880 --> 45:03.360]  i'm in over my head but but but here's a newsflash anyone in the world who thinks they're not in
[45:03.360 --> 45:07.440]  over their head with all this wild technology and all these crazy developments and all the
[45:07.440 --> 45:12.160]  changes happening and all the moves towards singularity these arrogant people that think
[45:12.160 --> 45:15.680]  they're in control these big multinational corporations and things i've met a lot of them
[45:15.680 --> 45:19.760]  they really are delusional they're specialists a lot of them kind of like asperger's disorder
[45:20.480 --> 45:25.360]  they're they're they're super smart in ways but they're missing overall well-roundedness
[45:25.920 --> 45:27.680]  and they just don't have enough
[45:27.680 --> 45:39.200]  restraint and enough understanding that no man is infallible they have that megalomaniac
[45:39.200 --> 45:46.480]  arrogance that always goes before a fall and they make so many mistakes and screw up so much
[45:46.480 --> 45:51.200]  already as the power of humanity increases with our technologies and our weapons
[45:51.200 --> 45:56.480]  i liken it to a chimpanzee
[45:59.680 --> 46:05.520]  that you've given pcp and a bottle of tequila and set it loose
[46:07.360 --> 46:10.480]  in a explosives factory with a flamethrower
[46:13.120 --> 46:18.400]  so that's that's the best humanity can offer with these elites the worst of us are running things
[46:18.400 --> 46:23.680]  that scampered in control and who got involved in family fortunes and and you know we're good
[46:23.680 --> 46:27.680]  at lying and stealing and manipulating and then they seize control of all these technologies and
[46:27.680 --> 46:34.000]  all these systems and they're in control and they're totally arrogant off their rockers nuts
[46:35.200 --> 46:39.840]  i've been at multiple parties where i've been around some of the top tech people and let me
[46:39.840 --> 46:48.400]  tell you they are more wild-eyed and crazy than rock stars they are on drugs there's all sorts
[46:48.400 --> 46:52.640]  of designer drugs these billionaires are on they are whacked out of their brains they've got some
[46:52.640 --> 46:59.760]  kind of drug that was produced at the university of texas and then divvied out that's a combination
[46:59.760 --> 47:06.400]  of ecstasy pcp lsd and peyote and and and and and the and all these other designer drugs and
[47:06.400 --> 47:14.000]  they're running around on this stuff i mean god help us they've got drugs like limitless
[47:14.000 --> 47:19.440]  that actually increase your IQ i mean all that stuff's real folks and they're on it
[47:20.400 --> 47:24.160]  they don't let the general public get a hold of it because to get the precursors
[47:24.960 --> 47:28.560]  that you need to make these drugs you've got to get a lot of other controlled substances and
[47:28.560 --> 47:32.560]  that's why these drugs aren't available to public but they got drugs that they're ready to roll out
[47:32.560 --> 47:36.720]  on the public that basically take your free will and people kill their own kids for you think people
[47:36.720 --> 47:42.640]  do bad things for heroin and cocaine wait till the super drugs get rolled out truly designer
[47:43.920 --> 47:44.400]  drugs
[47:49.360 --> 47:53.040]  all right i'm going to go to break and i'm going to come back with just in the intro with an
[47:53.040 --> 47:59.760]  extremely powerful donald trump piece and then i'm going to get into all this other news but there
[47:59.760 --> 48:09.440]  is just so much of it we're going to get into more on hillary depicts history making seen in
[48:09.440 --> 48:16.320]  depicts history making hillary clinton as a quote glowing god i talked about this some already but
[48:16.320 --> 48:22.480]  this is just freakazoid this just spells disaster it spells civilization on the edge of collapse
[48:22.480 --> 48:29.280]  every time in history that we allow the elites to start acting like this it's a manifestation
[48:29.280 --> 48:34.080]  and a reflection of ourselves and it means that you can stick a fork in us we're about to roll
[48:34.080 --> 48:41.600]  over dead like a big fat bloated rotting whale on the shore that's got birds feeding on it and
[48:41.600 --> 48:48.640]  that sticks a mile away i mean you've got this evil crone with a big jack-o-lantern smile worse
[48:48.640 --> 48:54.400]  than any marvel comic joker in a goddess outfit with a big pumpkin head that looks like a rubber
[48:54.400 --> 49:00.800]  mask smiling and leaning back i mean if you're a radio listener you've got to tune in next segment
[49:00.800 --> 49:07.680]  when i show this again it is over the top briefly i'm not going to belabor this we've
[49:07.680 --> 49:13.120]  been sold out of this since december we only had one run of it it is a hundred and 20 capsules
[49:13.120 --> 49:20.240]  enough to do a six-week cleanse that's the lifecycle of most parasites a lot of them are
[49:20.240 --> 49:24.960]  weaker too but the you know the furthest out is six six weeks generally with the general
[49:24.960 --> 49:28.480]  parasites i mean not the big ones like hillard but the small ones that infest about 90 of the
[49:28.480 --> 49:32.400]  people in the world uh big pharma doesn't need to know about this because they rather you just
[49:32.400 --> 49:36.800]  get sick and treat it forever but yourself your children your name and it's totally safe for
[49:36.800 --> 49:42.480]  everybody but still consult your physician before you walk out the door every day but everybody
[49:42.480 --> 49:48.960]  needs this and the the big nutraceutical experts you know the nutraceutical buffs just all give
[49:48.960 --> 49:54.800]  it five stars it's very very affordable it's available at infowarslife.com despite the fact
[49:54.800 --> 50:00.960]  this has been sold out for six months we are discounting it right now massively out of the gate
[50:03.920 --> 50:10.560]  so check it out at infowarslife.com today it's normally 44.95 it's a big bottle it's now 34.95
[50:10.560 --> 50:14.880]  and the reason it's so hard to source is we all want everything in there to be california standard
[50:14.880 --> 50:20.000]  which is almost impossible there's more lead in the air or or an apple than than what they allow
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.520]  so lawyers get to sue everybody that's why they passed it was a shutdown the nutraceutical
[50:23.520 --> 50:28.640]  business but we just test and test and test until our products pass that and so it's taking
[50:28.640 --> 50:32.880]  a six months to be able to get a batch that passes it because it's got so many ingredients that's
[50:32.880 --> 50:37.200]  the trick you get a few things that are totally clean when you get like there's like 30 different
[50:37.200 --> 50:42.880]  things in it it's hard you need this and we need the funding show detox declines get rid of the

[55:50.080 --> 55:58.160]  well no then die remember that from ghostbusters i mean this is crazy this is crazy hillary clinton
[55:58.160 --> 56:06.240]  has got seven million less voters than she got in 2008 trumps got three million record over anybody
[56:06.240 --> 56:15.280]  else 13 million but he's the loser fox says cnn says they all agree he's a loser hillary's way ahead
[56:15.280 --> 56:22.240]  and their fake polls they're running a jack o'lantern corpse against him let's go ahead and play this
[56:22.240 --> 56:38.640]  clip of the real Donald Trump would you like to be the president of the united states i really
[56:38.640 --> 56:43.200]  don't believe i would rather but i would like to see somebody as the president who could do the job
[56:43.200 --> 56:48.800]  and there are very capable people in this country why wouldn't you dedicate yourself to public service
[56:48.800 --> 56:54.160]  because i think it's a very mean life i would love and i would i would dedicate my life to this
[56:54.160 --> 56:58.560]  country but i see it as being a mean life and i also see it that somebody with strong views
[56:59.280 --> 57:03.760]  and somebody with the kind of views that are maybe a little bit unpopular which may be right
[57:04.400 --> 57:09.360]  but may be unpopular wouldn't necessarily have a chance of getting elected against somebody with
[57:09.360 --> 57:17.360]  no great brain but a big smile this this sounds like political presidential talk to me and i know
[57:17.360 --> 57:22.240]  people have talked to you about whether or not you want to run would you would you ever probably not
[57:22.240 --> 57:27.840]  but i i do get tired of seeing the country why would you not i just don't think i really have the
[57:27.840 --> 57:31.840]  inclination to do it i love what i'm doing i really like it also doesn't pay as well
[57:34.000 --> 57:38.640]  but you know i just probably wouldn't do it opera i probably wouldn't but i do get tired of seeing
[57:38.640 --> 57:42.720]  what's happening with this country and if it got so bad i would never want to rule it out totally
[57:42.720 --> 57:47.440]  because i really am tired of seeing what's happening with this country how we're how we're
[57:47.440 --> 57:53.120]  really making other people live like kings and we're not you've said though that if you did
[57:53.120 --> 57:58.000]  run for president you believe you'd win well i don't know i think i'd win i tell you what i
[57:58.000 --> 58:03.280]  wouldn't go in to lose i've never gone into losing my life and and if i did decide to do it i think
[58:03.280 --> 58:06.800]  i'd be inclined i would i would say that i would have a hell of a chance of winning because i think
[58:06.800 --> 58:10.400]  people i don't know how your audience feels but i think people are tired of seeing the united
[58:10.400 --> 58:14.480]  states ripped off and i can't promise you everything but i can tell you one thing this country would
[58:14.480 --> 58:19.120]  make one hell of a lot of money from those people that for 25 years have taken advantage it wouldn't
[58:19.120 --> 58:27.200]  be the way it's been believe me by the way go ahead and fade this down this is him on uh
[58:27.200 --> 58:31.520]  very keen live like 25 years ago i should probably play this and for radio listeners
[58:31.520 --> 58:35.840]  mention what year it is that's what makes it so powerful it starts with him 30 plus years ago
[58:35.840 --> 58:40.960]  right through to today it's the same guy folks it's the same guy but then he has this image as
[58:40.960 --> 58:45.440]  the apprentice host that's what folks think of him as but the real donald trump is a nationalist
[58:46.080 --> 58:51.360]  and a patriot who played ball with all the new york liberals it's not just our water we need to
[58:51.360 --> 58:55.760]  filter it's not just our food that needs to be cleaned it's the air we're breathing especially
[58:55.760 --> 59:01.760]  for our children the artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our
[59:01.760 --> 59:07.680]  immune systems the same team based right here in america that brought you the alexa pure groundbreaking
[59:07.680 --> 59:13.200]  water filtration systems have now developed alexa pure breeze whether it's your home or office you
[59:13.200 --> 59:18.560]  owe it to yourself your co-workers your family your children to the best job you can to purify
[59:18.560 --> 59:24.080]  your air one of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean this is a system i'm personally
[59:24.080 --> 59:29.280]  putting in throughout my house replacing older more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job
[59:29.280 --> 59:35.680]  the alexa pure breeze would be a steal at 300 400 500 it's normally 220 plus dollars but right now
[59:35.680 --> 59:41.600]  for limited time it's less than 200 dollars at infowarstore.com and the small profit we make goes
[59:41.600 --> 59:47.600]  to find our reporters this is a 360 win find out why this system is so revolutionary today at infowar
[59:47.600 --> 59:59.840]  store.com you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:09.120]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.320]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:19.440]  all right we just joined us larry nickle sue over a week ago said that trump was about to be coming
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:24.720]  out against hillary for other crimes and he was feeding info to the inquirer and to the trumps
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:29.440]  but he wanted to do it on this show so there wasn't any actual connection between the two
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.040]  and sure enough trump comes out two days ago and says i'm about to come out with a major
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:37.760]  speech next week and go after hillary for her other crimes there is a 27 minute compilation
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:44.560]  that we just posted info wars.com and the headline is this video will elect donald trump
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:50.960]  if it goes viral it's not even our video i'm pushing it want to get it out there but under
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.280]  the video there's a timeline this is why donald trump deserves to be president must see compilation
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:02.880]  36 years ago he talks to rona barrett and breaks down how we're being screwed over and he wants to
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:08.800]  stand up against the globalist 29 years ago he talks the Oprah Winfrey about it he talks about
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:15.920]  it at the gop convention 28 years ago 1989 interview 27 years ago c-span interview 25 years ago
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:24.080]  press interview 17 years ago right through to a 2015 press event very important video an
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.640]  article should be written about it but it's up on info wars.com it just went up there hit refresh
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:32.400]  send the links out to everybody you know i'm going to play a few more minutes of it right
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.080]  now but there it is this video will get donald trump elected if it goes viral
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:43.280]  now separately look at drudgereport.com if you're a radio listener go there world planners meet
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:49.440]  briggsit migrants trump on the menu we broke that three days ago now it's mainstream news
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:56.800]  but what did drudge do drudge linked to us of the last three days forcing them to then go
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:02:01.120]  and do their job at cnbc and the london guardian and the independent and then what does drudge
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:07.280]  linked to top link on drudge reporters chased away actually some reporters were arrested
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:13.760]  but that's what's intended c to not over report he ends up under reporting he's a great guy he's
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.800]  my probably my overall best reporter i don't want to say that because everybody's great in
[01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:20.240]  different ways but he's the most prolific he's the most successful there you go say it that way
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:25.680]  but bill berg cops detain harass reporters mainstream media nowhere to be seen Henry
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:33.680]  Kissinger heckled his annual confab of global elite begins and there's video of it all the rest of it
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:43.200]  and uh it's just amazing to see all of this unfolding so the coverage is all there top world
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:48.240]  leaders meet and and there's the former head of the uu buroso he still heads it up because they
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:52.720]  put themselves on these boards that have all the power it's amazing and then the police are there
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:58.080]  freaking out and acting like reporters behind government paid for big fences are the bad guys
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.680]  there's the good news the elite didn't want to be recognized they don't want to know that
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.360]  they're out there it's happening we are identifying the fact that this is going on
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:10.560]  let's play a few more minutes going out to break of this must see donald front video of him from
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:18.000]  the past we're now up to like 27 years ago here it is but you know i just probably wouldn't do it
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.680]  over i probably wouldn't but i do get tired of seeing what's happening with this country and
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:26.320]  if it got so bad i would never want to rule it out totally because i really am tired of seeing
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:31.040]  what's happening with this country how we're how we're really making other people live like kings
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:38.160]  and we're not you've said though that if you did run for president you believe you'd win well i don't
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:42.240]  know i think i'd win i tell you what i wouldn't go in to lose i've never gone into losing my life
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:47.200]  and and if i did decide to do it i think i'd be inclined i would i would say that i would have a
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:50.640]  hell of a chance of winning because i think people i don't know how your audience feels but i think
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.560]  people are tired of seeing the united states ripped off and i can't promise you everything
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:58.560]  but i can tell you one thing this country would make one hell of a lot of money from those people
[01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.320]  that for 25 years have taken advantage it wouldn't be the way it's been believe me
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:10.480]  but you might be classified as an eastern republican fair i guess you could say that yes
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:16.000]  which means kind of a rockefella chase Manhattan republican i never thought of another terms how
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.040]  do you define are you a bush republican no i think i'm really the people that i do best with are the
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:25.520]  people that drive the taxis you know wealthy people don't like me because i'm competing against them
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:29.520]  all the time and they don't like me and i like to win the fact is i go down the streets of new
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.920]  york and the people that really like me are the taxi drivers and the workers etc etc i mean i really
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:38.160]  like that why are you republican i have no idea i mean i have a republican because i just believe
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:43.280]  in certain principles of the republican party you have flirted all right go ahead and fade that
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:46.800]  down we're going to come back with more of this too this is powerful it's up on enforce.com
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:52.880]  but that's that's the intel that he does what he wants he does it his way he doesn't cozy up to
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:57.920]  these people he hangs out with regular folks they hate his guts the truth is his dad was blue collar

[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:17.920]  100 consistent on being a constitutionalist and anti-globalist and not liking to see american
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.640]  get screwed over the headline is this video will get donald trump elected if it goes viral separately
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:29.680]  because i know a lot of stations just joined us many stations just carry the second third or
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:38.240]  fourth hour uh headlines on drudge report dot com world planners meet what an amazing image of a
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:45.440]  world leader looking down on the earth the british exit migrants trump on the menu reporters chased
[01:09:45.440 --> 01:09:51.680]  away and why is that so important that's cnbc that's the london independent london guardian
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:55.280]  all reporting and others forced to admit the shadow world government
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:05.120]  and that meanwhile they still have other media outlets saying it doesn't exist there's no shadowy
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:09.040]  group you know nothing's happening but i go back to drudge report on monday tuesday and wednesday

[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:27.360]  britain from leaving the euro and now mainstream media says according to their sources it's the
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:33.280]  exact same agenda when before mainstream media wouldn't even admit it existed the point is info
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:40.160]  wars is leading the way with drudge report dot com and forcing the whore media the trader media the
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:52.160]  juda suscaria benedict arnold brian williams katie currick discredited fraud system the face
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:11:00.000]  in the crowd media is absolutely being shown for what it is what a defeat for them to have to admit
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:04.400]  world government that admit global carbon taxes how are they going to get all this
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:10.720]  well it isn't just something that shows up on your gas bill or your phone bill or or your
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:15.760]  insurance bill there's not supposed to be a public debate about it's just supposed to be
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:20.320]  everything's run by these secret treaties and that's the end of it we just shut up and go away
[01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:26.720]  and accept obama care except we're not going to just accept it we're going to show your leaders
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:32.000]  calling us dumb idiots like gruber did we're going to show zuckerberg calling us dumb efforts

[01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:42.800]  we're going to derail it this is so historic and we're so close to beating them ladies and gentlemen
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:48.560]  they don't want us to be prosperous they want us poor so that we're controllable that's what agenda
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:56.080]  21 and agenda 2030 the new second part of the rio de Janeiro agreement is is to bring in quote
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:04.800]  austerity impoverishment planned impoverishment and once that talking point which is their own
[01:12:04.800 --> 01:12:09.920]  talking point isn't just at davos meetings and bilderberg meetings but is out in the open
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:16.640]  it's the beginning of the end for david rockefeller and george soros and henry kissinger and hillary
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:22.720]  and all their minions and all their crones and prince philip and his son prince charles who were
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:27.120]  all admitted eugenesis that say get rid of 80 percent of the world's population produce viruses
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:31.760]  to kill us bring in world government while they live like kings they have been cutting off the last
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:39.200]  five years the gas allotment to widows and widowers impoverished people in england for i'm talking in
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:47.840]  the winter 300 400 pounds that's what it caught maybe you know maybe 600 700 is the equation we've
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:55.120]  covered it here so that people are freezing to death in the winter and old people are going
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:00.240]  and getting on buses that have heating to not freeze to death at night and being kicked off
[01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:11.280]  while over 100 palaces of majesty are heated in a giant multi-billion a year pound multi-pound
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:19.440]  multi-billion pound a year program to heat the palaces with gas let them eat cake they
[01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:22.560]  said maria and when that didn't say let them eat cake because they were starving to death she
[01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:27.840]  goes let them eat cake but you know what i do know queen elizabeth said let them freeze their asses
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:39.120]  off you keep my 100 palaces hotter than a firecracker oh and the sick freaks you can't have
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:43.600]  air conditioning in cars obama told africans remember that i quote that every day because
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:48.960]  that's the essence of these people they teach you that you being poor is how we get ahead
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:54.960]  with all this guilt instead of creating clean good systems oh they've got their clean systems
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:59.040]  those are boondoggles to steal money give it to their friends and not allow innovation
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:06.880]  trump shatters republican primary vote record historic 13 million blowout three million more
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:14.960]  than romney beat on campaign predictions reaching 1536 delegates we're talking almost 300 more than

[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:55.920]  crystal and john kasek said so and and i watched over and over again this morning fox news just
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:01.840]  monitoring them and they were just all up there talking about how trump can't win and it's all
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:08.000]  a giant hoax trump will win unless the assassinator or still the election and then everybody's asking
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:17.040]  me how could bernie not be winning when he got more delegates well the superdelegates said no
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:23.520]  and hillary gets up and says i will not be indicted watch just exactly what our guests said a year
[01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:28.880]  ago and 11 months ago and 10 months ago and nine months ago and then every week since then
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:34.000]  then as the quickening accelerates larry nickles the former handler of the clinton's to a great
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:40.080]  extent when they were co-governors there saying the whole thing is a red herring to make her the
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:45.600]  underdog and now we've seen the bizarre footage coming up of her with them saying she is a goddess
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:51.600]  in a white outfit where they put a filter on and she glows like the sun and they go she is god see
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:59.280]  it actually goes god she is a god with a giant jack-o-lantern head smiling like the most psycho
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:04.160]  she looks scarier than jack nicholson when jack nicholson does that scary smile can we pull up
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.040]  jack nicholson's scary smile and show her it's like jack nicholson's head doing a demonic smile
[01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:15.200]  man the screenshot we have there is even just you roll it while larry nickles talks on the phone
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:22.960]  today roll just that video of her when she leans back like a god and then goes a power trip and
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:28.800]  then does this bizarre jack-o-lantern crazed look like she's coming through a door with a battle axe
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:38.400]  here's johnny and she goes ah your mother does you know you know what your mother does in hell
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:45.680]  we now take you to arkansas where the man is fighting cancer we appreciate how much he's gone
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.920]  through uh they'll even be with us and that's that's larry nickles larry i gotta hand it to you
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.120]  you said hey i'm talking to the trump people we don't want to have or you know they've called me
[01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:56.480]  they don't have a you know it was your idea to not actually meet with them as they make a big deal
[01:16:56.480 --> 01:16:59.520]  out of it i think you should just go meet with them though i know you're battling cancer and you
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:03.600]  just said hey i'll just do it over your show and he's gonna be giving a speech soon about all this
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:07.840]  and he said yes next week he's doing a speech so just that's just interesting give us the
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:12.160]  scoop on that and then tell us the intel that you're relaying uh to the dossier that they've
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:16.720]  got lawyers researching and vetting to go after hillary next week on this big speech that trump
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:24.160]  announced well by the way hello Alex thanks for adding you bet larry come on because uh
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:33.440]  the whole process that i want to achieve now remember Alex and audience i i won't nothing
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:38.320]  official with my relationship with the trump people if there is such a thing relationship
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:46.560]  what i want is a candidate that i know when we bring a an issue out
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:57.120]  like on your program when we when we bring an issue out then we need a candidate running
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:05.840]  against hillary that will take that can help spread it around that aren't simple it's all we
[01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:14.960]  gotta do short of having somebody like trump on we're screwed because what's always happened
[01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:21.520]  when other people are in the race and the trump is not they're so connected and need everybody
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:28.880]  else's money so bad if they become pliable that's right that's right trump will will
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.800]  bully pulpit the anti-new order message and make america great again that's why they're crapping
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:42.400]  their pants no you bet you bet and so anyway this my strategy will be i'm going to serve up
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:50.160]  with your permission on your program every week and basically like we did when clinton was in
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:56.560]  bill clinton's an office scandal a week we're going to try to start off a little better than that but
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:05.280]  for just for continuity sake we try to stay at a new major scandal every week okay now a lot of
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:08.800]  the stuff you talked about three weeks ago did come out and inquire and you're one of the sources
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:13.520]  and trump is obviously you know the folks are tuned in vetting your claims here i know your
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:17.200]  claims to be accurate and we've been talking for 20 years on air larry so let's start getting into
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:20.560]  it right now this is so important i'm skipping this one break today let's get into what are we
[01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:23.920]  serving up this week i mean what's coming next what's going to be on that speech next week
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:32.480]  well to that end i can't say because i i don't to be honest i don't know i know what's going to
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:41.200]  be served up is mince foster i know alex and you did as well we've been told by media that's
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:47.840]  old news it's done been sealed up it's all over well let's just do this their talent remember
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:54.800]  when trump had to deal with it last week it was everywhere the media went nuts they were all over
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:20:02.960]  it right imagine this week originally next next week actually in his speech just imagine i'm not
[01:20:02.960 --> 01:20:09.680]  saying you'll do it it's up to you but imagine him saying in his speech folks they say that the
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:15.520]  investigation events foster is over that there's nothing to it the man committed suicide
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:24.640]  and then hey then you want to pick up that secret service memo that you have alex and hold it up
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:34.640]  for the world to see and say does this look like it's over does this look like you know the case
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:39.280]  has been solved it was truly a suicide and they could also have that secret service agent that
[01:20:39.280 --> 01:20:43.040]  just went public up there on stage with him talking about all the horrible things hillary did
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:51.280]  saying is this over because she's about to be your president right so that's that's the plan
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:57.760]  that's what's gotta happen and then you remember alex you and i talked about the secret service
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:05.360]  memo what a month ago a month and a half ago we talked about did a great job you putting it out
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:09.600]  people picked up on it and heard it but guess what it just wasn't enough it wasn't enough
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:17.680]  so as my training goes alex you know and it's a green gray you you become a force multiplier
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:23.040]  that's what you have to rely on your ability to create a bigger force well think about it alex
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:30.800]  if if trump were to come out and say they're saying this case is solved and it's over here's
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:37.520]  the secret service memo do you really believe it's solved is just is it over the media will
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:45.840]  immediately try to discredit trump and that report right and when they're trying to discredit it you
[01:21:45.840 --> 01:21:52.000]  know what they're doing spreading it spreading it you know and that's the plan we've got to do that
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.040]  i'm advising them the famous c-span footage that i haven't even fell on youtube but i know we've
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:22:02.320]  got a vhs tape so they could find it because it was released via subpoenas you remember all that you
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:07.280]  were involved in with all the communist generals in the white house meeting and then giving clinton
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:11.840]  money and the laurel and hues and the missile secrets i would go directly to china threatening
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:16.800]  to attack us today in the south china sea and point out the hillary presided over giving them
[01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:22.240]  the delivery and reentry systems that's hot reason that's what i'm telling and stone says don't
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:26.640]  worry that's going to be coming down the road he says hey we got to dole this out i don't know
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:31.200]  if i agree with stone i mean i think he just needs to start hammering her with everything he's got
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:38.880]  well exactly and remember this is the first couple of days that we can do it we had to hold
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:44.240]  back our fire until he made it through the primary or she made it through the primary she
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:50.800]  said the primary now now we're in the future match the future matches on folks and we're
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:55.760]  going to beat her at every turn we're going to beat hard you know alex sometimes just like me
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:23:00.960]  with my sickness you just want to go and go you know just cut off the suffering
[01:23:01.840 --> 01:23:06.400]  some things are too important you have to take your time you have to let it build you have to
[01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:11.120]  let it develop and that's where we're at okay so stone's right to dole this out how long do we
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:19.600]  dole this out then i'm afraid they'll kill him before then and nothing i can say about that
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:26.080]  we do it this way until sure sure well how long would you dole it out up until say the convention well
[01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:32.880]  no i would go this is stuff that i'll be doing every damn week from now until election day in
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:39.280]  november sure i know but but listen you accurately said there'll be no indictment is going to look
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:43.760]  like it it's not going to happen and now she basically quotes you saying it's not gonna happen
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:50.240]  that's right and you know why she said that she said that because you know why she was able to
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:56.640]  say that she's got the wrong FBI data files and the bad news for the or is sort of
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:04.640]  and you know alex you know i got now what does that mean folks you see you think
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:11.600]  you gotta not think single-dimensional but going after the cleanse i'm not just going after her
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:19.040]  i'm going after every one of them every one of me washington and the truth that she is
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:28.560]  using to blackmail and extort all these people in washington with we've got it and i guarantee
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:34.160]  there will be no quarter offers they're not gonna give me any and i'm just gonna return
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:41.360]  the favor none of them but the key to the secret service memo is to get it to where it's got legs
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:50.480]  then that secret service memo becomes significant another way because it as you know had any
[01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:58.160]  legitimate investigative investigative body like the FBI or whatever had that investigated as
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:04.560]  primary lead on it they would have wanted to know the mitigating circumstances of why
[01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:08.160]  why why would foster kill himself
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:15.520]  but you see there's no syside note until six seven eight days later
[01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:21.040]  when when they mentally the pressure was on them that there was no syside note
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:25.520]  and all of a sudden they go up to his office find that magic ring case that
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:31.920]  originally was in his car we had that from then the trip his ring case was in his car
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:35.040]  and there was blood all over
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:44.640]  they moved that body and you know we've talked about it before alex dominion
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:54.960]  and then i'm going to indict hillary on that uh vengazi stuff it's not going to indict her over
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:26:04.560]  that and not going to indict her but but we can knock the hell out of her budget her budget
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:11.440]  calls for alex she'll spend 60 to 70 percent of the money she raises to destroy
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:17.200]  Trump that's what they're going to do is do and destroy Trump
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:22.640]  and they're going to do it by saying he hates women and he hates hispanics yeah and it turns
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:27.120]  out this judge is a high-level uh mexican supremacist in my view a member of la baza
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:33.120]  and that's all seen as kosher by the media but uh his law firm has been putting money up to boycott
[01:26:33.120 --> 01:26:37.600]  trump they have been after trump he should recuse himself so what trump said about him is true he
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.960]  said i have nothing against him the fact that he's mexican but he's a mexican who's loyal to
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:47.520]  mexico i don't know why you want to be loyal to a failed state uh but it's just crazy and then
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:51.680]  that's who obama's been putting in charge is just a bunch of people that won't get along with each
[01:26:51.680 --> 01:26:58.640]  other a bunch of balkanized divided and conquered folks but that issue's moved on uh i see the hoax
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:27:03.920]  being pushed that he's way behind her in the polls and that he's in trouble despite the numbers and
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.520]  many other polls showing the opposite what does your gut tell you the real numbers are
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:15.120]  matter the gut my gut is accurate right now it's 40 40 20
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:22.640]  that's exactly where it is right now 40 40 20 40 percent for trump 40 percent for
[01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:31.840]  delivery and three percent in the middle and don't care that's where it's at right now you can run
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:41.200]  10 million polls and i assure you if they show the real results of the polls and if the questions
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:47.200]  are the ones that they normally ask that figure of 40 40 20 will hold
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:54.480]  and it's held up through just the time for our founding fathers i mean it was good enough to
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:28:01.520]  them it's good enough for us we just can't we can't let them win we're almost out of time
[01:28:01.520 --> 01:28:06.560]  and and you know specifically give us a preview because i want to start this you know as soon
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:10.960]  as we start going here the the info that you've been imparting to the trump people are what to
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:14.960]  look at next uh you know you just mentioned some more of the vince foster you mentioned some more
[01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:19.200]  i mentioned the chinese generals the missile secrets what else should trump get into in the
[01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:32.640]  speech coming up well the one thing that he must bring up in the speech is how did north korea get
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:36.560]  their nuclear weapons exactly the clinton's pulled that out and allowed them to get reactors that
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:41.920]  could enrich uranium that's another great point there you go yeah and you know and the reason
[01:28:41.920 --> 01:28:48.320]  that will have appeal to the broad audience if we can get them to pay attention long enough to hear it
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:56.080]  that's a game changer that's a lose lose for america we not only give north korea
[01:28:56.080 --> 01:29:07.120]  two technologies that could have been given to the north korea one was that if the one system
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:15.120]  um provides the power they need etc etc because one thing it does not create any back product or
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:20.800]  waste products that can be used to nuke make an improve that's right they gave them a system
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:26.160]  that allows them to make atomic and hide weapons to remember the whole thing that was like a bb
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:32.320]  wasn't it i mean it's just yep of course well and and the other thing that trumps got a point out
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:38.080]  is that that they haven't changed their strides at all what is the system that we've been working
[01:29:38.080 --> 01:29:43.600]  with in this the broken coalition strategy how he tells she's the divider all right larry we'll
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:48.720]  talk to you again they've made in iran okay oh iran's good too all right we'll talk to you again

[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:34.320]  waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:46.400]  war well i i just hate what's happened to this country we've gone to a country that's no longer
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:51.280]  respected we're in a war that we should have never and by the way i'm worse than any hawk there is
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:57.200]  in terms of military and in terms of defending ourselves but saddam hussein didn't knock down
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:05.520]  the world trade center he had nothing to do with it and there were no weapons of mass destruction
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:12.720]  the other day the head of uh three m said that president obama is anti-business do you get the
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:18.800]  same feeling that he does well i don't know that it's anti-business or he just really doesn't know
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:24.720]  exactly uh what to do and i'm afraid it probably is the second thing i don't see him necessarily
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:30.960]  as anti-business i think that he is not sophisticated in the ways of business he hasn't dealt with the
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:37.200]  people that you've dealt with and that i've dealt with i deal with china as an example a lot it is
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:42.400]  never easy and i've made some very big deals with the chinese i've come out on top i've come out in
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:47.760]  great shape i sell apartments to chinese people i get along great with them it's not like you know
[01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:53.440]  anti-china i just think it's ridiculous that we allow them to do what they're doing to this country
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:58.640]  with the manipulation of the currency that you write about and understand and all of the other
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:03.760]  things that they do and frankly if i were them and if i could get away with it i take my hat off to
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:12.320]  them frankly they they do get away with it and i hire companies all the time and it's so hard for
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:18.560]  our companies to compete against chinese countries companies i mean these these companies have such
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:23.440]  an advantage whether it's glass for a curtain wall or whether it's and you use the term because you
[01:35:23.440 --> 01:35:28.240]  know what's happened sheet rock i mean they used to give us sheet rock just give it and everybody
[01:35:28.240 --> 01:35:33.040]  that was unfortunate enough to use chinese sheet rock had problems i mean problems like no where
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:38.400]  people were dying from it the goodness thief our product is much better but with the manipulation
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:42.960]  of their currency it's very very very hard for our companies to compete
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:50.880]  but i'll certainly do whatever is necessary and whatever i can help whether they want me to
[01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:55.920]  make speeches whether they want me to contribute raise money i'll do whatever i have to do we need
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:05.280]  somebody great as a president i know that you were mentioning that erin and i did a kind of an
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:11.040]  interesting video i'm not that long ago in august about how things have fallen apart but at that
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:16.880]  point the only people who were saying it were us and you i was saying it i was saying it a long
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:23.040]  time ago and frankly they're talking about 50 basis points i think you should drop it a point a full
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:29.520]  solid hundred basis points and just sit back and see and i was actually looking at somebody a gentleman
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:34.640]  from goldman sacks was saying 175 so that's going to be interesting but i think that's ultimately
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.520]  going to be happy and it would be nice if ben could get now ahead of the curve instead of always being
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:44.640]  behind the curve all right behind the curve say what you want that is a compilation and and this
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:48.640]  is getting into more modern times but it's really powerful the first 10 minutes or so it's up on
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:54.000]  info wars dot com this is why donald trump deserves to be president it's the name of the video we've
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.640]  put it up there on info wars dot com with the headline that this video will make donald trump
[01:37:00.640 --> 01:37:05.440]  president if it goes viral this video will get done for elected if it goes viral this is why
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:10.560]  donald trump should be president and it's really the first 10 minutes that's the most powerful him
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:16.480]  back in 1980 87 88 you name it talking about globalism and how it's screwing over our economy and how
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:22.800]  it's one sided deals by the political class working with the elites now shifting gears out of that
[01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:30.400]  we're about to go to dresden germany the side of bill berg 2016 and charlie skelton will pop in
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:34.880]  briefly during the next hour i'm going to cover other news though most of the time he's running
[01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:39.360]  guardian reporter to give us his view on bill berg this year and the anthony gucciardi will be
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:45.520]  hosting the fourth hour with all the latest news and special reports and more now there's a lot i
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:50.960]  want to get to today so i'm just going to spend about 10 minutes with paul watson and rob do about
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:55.040]  some of the big developments at bill berg this year and then i'm going to get into the economy the
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:38:00.880]  ebt card suddenly not working in different areas around the country causing civil unrest in some
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:08.800]  areas already we're going to get into the bizarre media billing hillary as a god a goddess a savior
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:13.120]  but also you know you see these daily show compilations where the reporters all have the
[01:38:13.120 --> 01:38:18.640]  same talking point about the easter bunny or about christmas or whatever this is the same
[01:38:18.640 --> 01:38:23.440]  talking point about hillary and again this stuff comes out of the white house people say why do you
[01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.640]  care about media matters the website it's almost no traffic but it's run by the white house and the
[01:38:28.640 --> 01:38:33.280]  clintons they admit so when they put it out that's when i get attacked in a thousand publications
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:39.040]  which by the way i love keep it up please i mean it's like being attacked by hitler or being attacked
[01:38:39.040 --> 01:38:45.040]  by a child molester you just still don't get you got a six percent trust rate with the american people
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:51.200]  please jorro george soros nazi collaborator run media white house run media please keep saying i'm
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:57.600]  horrible how's it going for you saying bill berg didn't exist now it's all admitted world government
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:03.440]  out in the open how's it going for you you've discredited yourselves but you're too narcissistic
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:07.440]  and too evil to admit it's happened we're going to paul watson because instead of just being there
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:11.440]  at the bill berger hotel with our meeting where reporters have been arrested our reporters have
[01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:17.280]  been detained harassed you name it that's top story on drugs by the way we can put that up for a moment
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:24.240]  despite that it is down the street at the train stations where the drug dealing and the raping
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:30.240]  and all the rest of it is going on with all of the wondrous little migrants that have taken over
[01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:38.080]  but before we go to paul watson they're in dresden we have a new edition of the hillary for prison
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:45.760]  shirt and it looks like a classic campaign shirt it says hillary for prison 2016 it's the second
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:50.320]  variant we are not going to produce more of this best-selling shirt we're going to keep it pretty
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:57.680]  much the same but add info wars dot com in red to the right shoulder and leave info wars dot
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:04.640]  com legalized freedom on the back but if you want to get the last variant that says hillary
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:10.560]  for prison until the end of time it's got 4.9 stars out of five and you want to support the
[01:40:10.560 --> 01:40:15.600]  broadcast get that limited edition now because the new ones come in in a week and these will

[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:26.640]  that shows her as the leering joker on the front and more than just fighting the info war and
[01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:30.960]  spreading the word about hillary for prison this is about exercising the first amendment she's been
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:36.480]  trying to attack telling comedians you know they'll be auditive they talk about about her and stuff
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:41.600]  and it's about meeting like-minded people and showing solidarity at different political rallies
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:46.960]  trump almost every day now says oh look hillary for prison i love info wars this is have it's
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:51.600]  all over news feeds it's all over mainstream tv hillary for presence being picked up people are

[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:06.800]  a lot of crazy people around here as you can see yeah that's that's watch out now keep going just
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:13.520]  bilderberg itself we've got george soros betting on a massive economic collapse as he talked about
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:17.760]  earlier with the wall street journal which is interesting because we've got new intel which is
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:22.880]  in the video uh the interview with tony gozzling which rob did which is on the alex jones channel
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:27.920]  which i'm going to write an article about he's predicting that they're talking about preparing
[01:46:27.920 --> 01:46:34.400]  for a huge financial collapse now you remember when you went to canada in 2006 you got the intel
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:40.320]  that an american delegate said the same thing two years before the housing bubble part and two years
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:46.400]  but before the 2008 economic collapse so it happened then we got the intel out before and it's
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:50.640]  happening and that was directly from a bilderberg group member from the us to daniel listell on
[01:46:50.640 --> 01:46:54.800]  later and learn the name of the person who's also owned a large hollywood production company still
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:59.440]  does will stop there but when we have our sources we're just letting folks know uh and and so you're
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:04.080]  saying we're getting other good intel they're preparing for another collapse right now yeah and
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:09.760]  that comes from somebody who's got good sources in fact he was able to predict that henry kissinger
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:17.120]  would arrive at 3 25 p.m. today because some intel has been leaking exactly 3 25 henry kissinger
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:22.320]  arrived we were able to get photographs of him he was lectured but he was heckled by the crowds
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:26.800]  by the way that's the top story on drudgerport.com some reporters were it's arrested when they put
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:30.720]  you in a van in handcuffs but you know uh what happened to you guys on that front then we'll
[01:47:30.720 --> 01:47:36.000]  go back to the economic collapse well last night we were walking back from the restaurant um back
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:42.240]  to the hotel um we walked past the other journalists that were in the report there and almost immediately
[01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:47.200]  within a few footsteps we were accosted by several police officers we were just walking back to the
[01:47:47.200 --> 01:47:53.360]  hotel we weren't even filming at that point and so then more police officers arrived more vans
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.640]  arrived they kind of kettled us in surrounded us and they started obviously trying to intimidate us
[01:47:58.640 --> 01:48:03.840]  this is what they do every single year at bilderberg they try to intimidate the press so
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:09.360]  well they basically said we were being stopped for causing a distraction they demanded our
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:14.960]  passports we gave them our passports and then they demanded to bag searches and i mean i didn't
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:19.840]  even have a bag so i literally had to empty out my pockets to show them what was in my pockets
[01:48:19.840 --> 01:48:26.560]  they took each of us individually behind the van to search us all individually and they were thorough
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:30.800]  they were looking for anything that they could get us on and then we were cordoned off to a
[01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:36.880]  different area everyone was individually searched and we were finally given back our passports
[01:48:36.880 --> 01:48:42.320]  and told by the police if you cause another distraction you will be arrested so we said
[01:48:42.320 --> 01:48:47.840]  what is a distraction and what constitutes a distraction they said causing trouble so it's
[01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:53.520]  all completely vague to give the pretext the pretense to arrest us for basically nothing
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:59.360]  and it was pretty intense it went on for about 45 minutes we were showing footage for tv viewers
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:03.600]  radio listeners can go to info wars dot com four slash show to see the live feed or see all the videos
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:08.160]  posted there go to drugsreport dot com it's the top story there along with them announcing world
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:12.160]  government internet taxes going out with donald trump and you know it's great to see the fact
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:17.200]  that you got their agenda three days ago drugs reported on it and now mainstream media is echoing
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:22.960]  exactly what we broke three days later boy i mean who who are the conspiracy theorists now paul
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:29.120]  well i mean we've i mean merc called herself she came to bilderberg five months before she
[01:49:29.120 --> 01:49:33.840]  became chancellor you know we got them picking tony blare bill clinton we got them picking
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:38.480]  nato secretary generals they come here they're groomed they're elected they're picked they're
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:43.600]  chosen so it's happened time and time again we've been proven right you were proven right in 2006
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:49.920]  and that's what we're hearing again now in 2016 that they're planning to pop this bubble obviously
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:54.800]  there's huge problems in china with the stock market there the luxury property market around
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:50:00.080]  europe is now starting to crumble so all the signs are coming in and that's the intel that we've got
[01:50:00.080 --> 01:50:05.760]  that they're preparing to profit from an economic collapse that's right that's why soros who's been
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:10.800]  out of the markets and out of real estate that they announced today is now entering in big time
[01:50:10.800 --> 01:50:17.200]  the grim reaper is coming in to enjoy his work exactly so we've got the video interview up on
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:21.760]  that again as i said gozzling always gets some good information because he's been tracking this for
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:27.200]  20 years plus so he got the information he got the times that all the people were arriving we
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:31.920]  use that to our benefit and he got this information as well so again there's going to be another huge
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:37.520]  article about that on info wars dot com i love how the cops are bugging their eyes out like you
[01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:43.200]  guys have done something you're just reporters everybody knows who you are and and paul but be

[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:48.000]  living defense i've been taking it for six weeks now that it's back in stock and m4slife.com okay going
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:54.960]  back to paul joseph watson paul you're in resident and folks just tuned in uh all i basically see is
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:59.360]  quote migrants walking around they're from north africa they're from the middle east i see a
[01:55:59.360 --> 01:56:04.400]  little girl there with her face covered up with a hot jib uh tell us tell us what you're witnessing
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:10.720]  and are you going to go inside the train station well yeah we can do it's very different to downtown
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:15.120]  resident where the hotel is and where builder burgers thing there's a lot of migrants around
[01:56:15.120 --> 01:56:19.200]  here because there's a camp nearby which we've been told about so we're going to visit that at some
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:25.040]  point so yeah it's i mean when i came in it was it was pretty bad but yeah it's it's a little
[01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:29.920]  sketchy i mean it's not awful but yeah there are a lot of migrants here because they brought in 5 000
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:35.760]  into a city that's you know about 500 000 people and they're going to bring more in another interesting
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:40.880]  thing out of builderberg though was that we spoke to a guy who said that he'd spoken to the guy who
[01:56:40.880 --> 01:56:46.720]  owns the pizzeria behind the builderberg hotel which is almost you know directly connects to it
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:52.400]  he was told by the police that they would have to have access to his pizzeria at all times they
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:57.120]  could go in and out and that it was yeah they would have the keys they would own the keys to
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:01.520]  this guy's house for the period while builderberg is here so we're going to go and speak to him to
[01:57:01.520 --> 01:57:06.800]  get his side of the story if he speaks english and then he also said that they were bringing in
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:12.080]  special furniture into the builderberg hotel days before the builderberg members arrived
[01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:17.040]  now you saw from rob's video that it wasn't a very plush hotel not very well decorated for a five
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:24.000]  star hotel they were bringing in furniture that was covered high end luxury furniture specifically
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:28.720]  for the builderberg members days before they arrived so again that's another tidbit and again
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:34.000]  you know a wink and a nod to their elitism that even a five star hotel is not good enough for them
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:38.560]  they have to bring in their own stuff but it's also fitting like world war two that they're kind of
[01:57:38.560 --> 01:57:45.920]  in a bunker now not as nice a hotel you know not surrounded with hundreds of acres not as highly
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:50.640]  protected because their whole project the euro is in trouble and i love how media is now admitting
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:55.200]  builderberg exists but just as it's a secret talking group but it's protected by governments
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:58:00.800]  when they're the ones that admit they created the european union project yeah and that's what
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:05.280]  they're talking about again the euro crisis another interesting thing is one of the top german
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:10.720]  ministers came out today and said that germany needs to accept this mass uh muslim migration they
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:16.240]  need to accept interbreeding which is interesting because it goes back to what greg olgeis he said
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:21.440]  where he said it's fortunate that only the nap that the nazis didn't have children remember that quote
[01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:26.240]  and of course people want to marry somebody that's fine but the government says you will have sex
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:30.160]  and have kids with somebody else that isn't your country because it's bad you're white it's bad you're
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:34.560]  german and this is coming out of these you guys have interviews with germans going good we want to
[01:58:34.560 --> 01:58:39.920]  get rid of germans yay we i mean they're just cult members back in 70 seconds with paul joseph

[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:34.480]  rob do's take on this as well we've got three of our reporters there all i can say is incredible
[02:00:34.480 --> 02:00:39.040]  job crew they are forcing the mainstream media to report on what's happening secret global
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:43.680]  government meetings amazing paul you're there at the train station we saw a bunch of police raids
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:51.040]  and we've seen women in hijabs walking around and kids kids running around appearing to be
[02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:56.320]  on something i'm not sure uh with another man that was drunk uh talking on cameras and they were
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:01.840]  from north africa and afghanistan other points and then i'd like to you know basically get a
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:08.960]  ground tour for tv viewers and i'll narrate for radio listeners yeah one other point is that
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:14.720]  there were two arrests today um there were two protesters who just turned up calmly sat down
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:18.800]  outside the barricades they weren't screaming they weren't shouting they weren't saying anything
[02:01:18.800 --> 02:01:23.920]  they were holding two cardboard signs which said something like why why the trans why the secrecy
[02:01:23.920 --> 02:01:28.720]  will we want transparency something like that completely non-offensive there were no cuss words
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:34.320]  in the signs after about 30 minutes the police came up to them and eventually it was three rows
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:39.760]  thick of police obviously to keep us dangerous reporters away from them they had a long conversation
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:45.440]  about how there was no free speech in germany while bilderberg is in the town of dresden and
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:50.640]  they were forced to put the signs away and that's where it stopped um in that moment but a few hours
[02:01:50.640 --> 02:01:57.520]  later uh the police came back and arrested them for possessing a tent they had this little green
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:02.080]  tent i don't know what they were doing with it but these people who were british um you know
[02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:06.320]  they were quite polite people they were just having a conversation with the police but no free speech
[02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:12.320]  in germany while bilderberg is in town and it's ironic because they were accosted by the police
[02:02:12.960 --> 02:02:18.160]  and literally about five minutes later um bernand jordan arrived i think that's his name
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:23.280]  and he's a civil rights activist so you've got a top civil rights activist heading into bilderberg
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:29.520]  while within five minutes people are being harassed simply for holding protest signs outside of
[02:02:29.520 --> 02:02:34.800]  bilderberg and having their free speech crushed so i thought that was kind of ironic well i mean
[02:02:34.800 --> 02:02:40.160]  look i don't say this to be sensational in fact i'm almost ashamed but i'm not more upset germany has
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:45.040]  fallen to tyranny germany is like nazi germany again but it's leftist control they're arresting
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:50.880]  people for rallying they're telling people shut up uh that's just it's horrible that germany
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:56.560]  has police that have turned into anti-free speech thugs and who follow illegal orders this is this
[02:02:56.560 --> 02:03:02.480]  is despicable well it's not just germany we saw it last year in austria i mean we got pretty much
[02:03:02.480 --> 02:03:07.280]  the same treatment there they kind of relented in the last couple of days i would bring up to these
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:12.160]  people when they say we're gonna arrest you if you keep covering this i'd say nurenberg code
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:19.200]  nurenberg i would i'd say nurenberg remember don't just follow orders i would declare nurenberg code
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:24.880]  that'll be in the paper and might actually wake germans up like yeah nurenberg code we've heard
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:30.560]  reports that some of them are threatening physical violence against other reporters who are here i
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:34.960]  don't know whether that's true it might not be but that shows us some of the claim absolutely look
[02:03:34.960 --> 02:03:39.280]  look here's the thing they're nice until you don't follow their orders and they follow orders and
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:45.520]  that's what allowed hitler to do what he did be your own people don't be robots no exactly and i mean
[02:03:45.520 --> 02:03:50.240]  i mean in saying that there's a lot of political activism around this city i mean just driving
[02:03:50.240 --> 02:03:54.800]  here to the Germans on average that are awake are great people it's their police that have the problem
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:00.640]  yeah a lot of people seem to be informed some don't i mean a lot of the tourists that come here
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:05.360]  um didn't know what was going on but we spoke to one guy from napal who was an immigrant the student
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:11.200]  immigrant to germany he's been here for four years speaks perfect english he was unhappy about how the
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:17.760]  media was portraying pagida as racist he's a trump supporter he's against this migrant invasion and
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:24.000]  he's a hard-working immigrant who's learned the language integrated he's a big fan of us and you
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:29.600]  know he sees it exactly same the same way so that was a real narrative buster and again that was a
[02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:34.720]  another good interview that's up on the alex jones channel paul joseph watch that amazing job keep
[02:04:34.720 --> 02:04:40.000]  dominating keep exposing the globalist this is superhero level events we're seeing with the info

[02:04:50.960 --> 02:04:56.480]  reported on them not having votes in colorado how dare him say that the election was suspended
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:03.440]  how dare you care how dare i care the bilderberg 2016 public agenda says they will be talking about
[02:05:03.440 --> 02:05:10.000]  the usual items like china russia the middle east technology but there's one new item the precarious
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:16.720]  it's a term coined by a uk economist to describe what he sees as the precarious proletariat he calls
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:22.080]  him a dangerous class of people who've been harmed by globalism according to his book which is one
[02:05:22.080 --> 02:05:27.360]  of only 10 subjects to be covered at bilderberg he breaks down society into several classes under
[02:05:27.360 --> 02:05:31.920]  the small number of super rich elite who are meeting at bilderberg are the salatarian then
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:38.000]  there's the professional technicians he calls proficient then we come to the dangerous ones the
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:44.400]  precarious who work menial low paying jobs so how do the elite propose to control the precarious
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:49.760]  that he says are an incipient political monster while he proposes giving every legal resident
[02:05:49.760 --> 02:05:56.080]  of a country money without a job to create a permanent dependent class what hg wells called

[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:31.440]  that's right take us up to bill berg the big shadow government that wants to have a worldwide
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:36.080]  internet tax so they can track you and tax you and shut you off the web and once they end the
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:40.960]  family put us all in 200 square foot coffin apartments so we pay 90% of our money in taxes
[02:08:40.960 --> 02:08:48.320]  since siphoned off to them who were exempt they want to play god they want to stay hidden
[02:08:48.320 --> 02:08:54.880]  in the shadows as their world government project is constructed but they shouldn't be too proud
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:09:03.600]  of this technological terror because humanity rising and being aware of it will end it we
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:08.240]  have the ultimate veto power now rob do is going to report with us a few minutes and i'm going to
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:15.280]  get into all these democrat websites and the new york daily news and others going but bernie sanders
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:19.360]  had more delegates and hillary clinton just got the super delegates who are party officials
[02:09:19.360 --> 02:09:24.080]  and they're ignoring the fact that bernie really want all these states and should be the leader
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:27.760]  well and then they have all these weird socialist women going does it matter it's part of our
[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:34.480]  socialist plan she's a woman so it's okay it's like it's okay ted cruiser's a real conservative
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:39.200]  so he's allowed to get all the votes in states and suspend the voting or you have the voting
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:43.760]  and then they just take the delegates so this is a big deal and then them saying she's a goddess
[02:09:43.760 --> 02:09:48.960]  on seeing in and blurring everything as she shines like jesus and his ascension or something
[02:09:48.960 --> 02:09:56.160]  and they say look at the god so that's all going on but right now let's go back to dresden at the
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:10:02.160]  train station to see the results of the country flooded with the illegals uh there and then
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:08.080]  give us a tour i'll narrate for radio listeners rob did yeah well alex right now the guy that
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:12.000]  was jumping around earlier he seems to have pissed off another uh person who's over here
[02:10:12.000 --> 02:10:19.760]  the fight might ensue in one second um let's go over there all right but he was from uh
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:26.400]  amganistan or from algeria now alex i ran around and shot a bunch of b-roll before we went on live
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:32.400]  and uh just walking around just walking around here i saw the cops questioning several groups
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:36.320]  of immigrants just asking for their papers and whatnot when we walked up there was a guy
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:41.120]  showing them their id and um you know and then going through the train station some couldn't
[02:10:41.120 --> 02:10:45.120]  get on one guy couldn't get on the train because he didn't have a ticket but he was trying to get
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:49.760]  on the train the guy said no so he said they're talking to his friends and you know right now
[02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:54.160]  it doesn't seem like it's super busy but it's uh it seems to be you know packed with guys just
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:11:00.640]  hanging out loafing around as you could uh as you would say and um you know it's interesting i
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:05.040]  talked to a family a day a couple i put the interview up on info wars dot com this is a
[02:11:05.040 --> 02:11:09.680]  she was german he was jewish and uh they seem kind of fine with the migrants coming in they
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:14.080]  think they have everybody seems to think there's this endless pool of money to pay for benefits
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:19.680]  and housing and food even though most of these radical muzzles being brought in on record want
[02:11:19.680 --> 02:11:25.120]  to kill every few thing at their hands on that's true and and and we kind of got into that at the
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:32.320]  end and uh i said something in the in terms of you know uh maybe germany has uh holocaust um
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:35.360]  they feel bad for the holocaust so they're letting these people in to make up for it
[02:11:35.360 --> 02:11:39.520]  and he didn't want to get into that and that kind of pissed him off and then they look at globalism
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:43.920]  it's a project to end europe it's a project to create total division they're bringing in people
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:48.720]  that just sit around on a bunch of bombs and uh you know adopt every form of crime you can imagine
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:55.840]  because under islam it's okay to commit crimes against non-muslims exactly and um you know another
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:12:01.280]  interesting uh part uh thing that happened today people we keep walking people were um coming up
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:05.200]  to us wanted to know what was going on all the tours were you know the tours were going through
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:08.560]  and they would stop they would hear us speaking english what's what's going on what's going on so
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:12.960]  then i just started videotaping these people and uh saying well i'm gonna have to videotape you if
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:17.600]  i'm gonna tell you what this is you're gonna get educated and so we just you know start telling
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:21.440]  about the billderberg group because there wasn't much going on for a few hours we're sitting there
[02:12:21.440 --> 02:12:26.320]  waiting i guess the highlight was uh two highlights reverne and jordan and henry kissinger have yet
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:31.360]  to see lindsay graham show up let me ask you this question yeah they just started arriving you know
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:35.920]  today and they're running so the real billiards thursday friday saturday and then sunday well
[02:12:35.920 --> 02:12:41.680]  really on monday sometimes why go ahead why what triggered the police because i know this happened
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:46.000]  in austria last year too is it fair to say the worst police we've seen are in germany and austria
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:49.840]  because i mean we would report if somebody did something for the police to respond but but from
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:54.800]  what i heard from paul no one's doing anything people are polite they're like threatening to arrest
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:13:00.640]  or arresting british uh tourist i mean british tourists are stereotypically the nicest people on
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:06.160]  the planet yeah and and those people were and they saw what happened last night so they knew what i
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:10.400]  think what they were getting into when they did their little protest uh but basically just said
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:14.640]  what their sign said what have you had to hide and the other sign said this will get confiscated
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:19.200]  prophetic because it did get confiscated and we've got that video coming out we shot at many parts
[02:13:19.200 --> 02:13:22.800]  because it was kind of a long situation there's photos up in the story at drudgerport.com the
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:29.360]  photos are there okay good good and you know it's just amazing um the way we're being treated and
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:33.360]  last night while we were getting harassed by the police the the 20 or so police that harassed was
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:36.720]  there any trigger i mean because they looked hateful they just looked like they hated you
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:41.040]  well at some point they got really mad at my light i turned on a video light because it was pitch
[02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:46.000]  black almost and you know i like to shoot good videos so i turned on a light and then one guy
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:52.240]  just started going off and i could tell what he was mad at through the broken german that i speak
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:58.160]  and um you know so uh and then our translator who also seemed to be pro migrant said uh he
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:02.240]  doesn't like your light could you turn it off and uh but they thoroughly searched my bag they
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:06.080]  went through every pocket pulled out every little thing they pulled out the safety pins i had safety
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:12.240]  pins in a little pocket they checked your papers and searched everything thoroughly no yeah they
[02:14:12.240 --> 02:14:15.920]  did they're very thorough and they were marveling at the tools that i had i have all these little
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:20.640]  tools for things and oh a little tool and i'm like yeah i use a lot of tools i'm kind of german like
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:27.120]  you guys and uh but it was it was really it was surreal because we really got five steps away
[02:14:27.120 --> 02:14:32.240]  from this restaurant and and and they were on us the the then the band started pulling up more
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:37.440]  band started pulling up and it was how they they went after the two uh cardboard protesters the
[02:14:37.440 --> 02:14:42.640]  cardboard sign protesters they um surround like four were just standing there kind of stalking
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:46.880]  them and then they all came at once and one guy you could tell he was uh i think learning
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:53.200]  how to be a uh a police a terror a tyrannical police officer started reading from the guidebook
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:59.440]  you know uh dresden makes law where you cannot have signed here but you could have a sign over
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:03.600]  here so they were speaking english to the to the english speakers and it was just very interesting
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:08.160]  to watch that go on and uh josh shot some good footage from up top i shot some footage of it
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:12.240]  we're going to be putting that up so by the way you know there's a lot of tall buildings in dresden
[02:15:12.800 --> 02:15:17.520]  that's because what 500 000 people got killed in one night in a famous bombing that was supposedly
[02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:23.120]  a children's city off limits they had agreement with england uh but to get hitler mad to shift gears
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:29.440]  and stop bombing military bases they they they they sin in raf rage to bomb civilian targets
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:33.200]  and hitler took the bait and lost world war two because of it dresden was a key turning point
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:40.560]  correct and when we were in the pigita uh uh protest there's a little marker where the first bomb
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:45.360]  fell so they make a little it fell in the square there and they made well the germans already
[02:15:45.360 --> 02:15:51.040]  followed a globalist project once i mean the euro is a nazi project so here they are helping
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:56.320]  continue a real nazi project that'll destroy their own families and collapse germany and they don't
[02:15:56.320 --> 02:16:00.160]  care because the cops you don't think they're god it's a perfect example of compartmentalization
[02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:05.360]  yeah that's that's correct and and that's what they said we don't make these rules up
[02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:10.320]  we're just following order next time bring up nurenberg code i declared nurenberg if people
[02:16:10.320 --> 02:16:14.240]  brought that up during while while this was going on somebody said that's them from nurenberg that's
[02:16:14.240 --> 02:16:19.600]  from nurenberg and and that's exactly what it was and uh last night i got i got mad after a while
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:24.640]  sometimes it takes me a while but once i get mad i start like spouting off and um i started spouting
[02:16:24.640 --> 02:16:29.120]  up well if i was a syrian migrant you guys would be kissing my ass and giving me a home and food
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:33.680]  and all this money you wouldn't be treating me like this and uh i don't know if that pissed
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:38.000]  them off or not they didn't really answer me but today you know today i talked to a few of them i
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:42.000]  talked to a guy had been to california he'd heard my accent wanted to know where i was from and we
[02:16:42.000 --> 02:16:45.600]  we talked for a while and he's working on a sergeant but you know these people are
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:48.960]  essentially i told him i said the reason people don't like you and they're disrespecting you is
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:53.440]  because you're protecting criminals and that's the bottom line and you could you could say oh
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:57.600]  they're not criminals they're criminals these people are criminals they work above the law
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:17:02.560]  they they think the law doesn't affect them that's right and following their orders doesn't
[02:17:02.560 --> 02:17:07.920]  protect you i mean plus your peaceful press yeah exactly they're arresting germans all over the
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:12.320]  country that try to protest the open borders the german government works for globalists
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:20.080]  and is is a is a outside occupying group taking you over do you understand that comprende
[02:17:20.080 --> 02:17:25.280]  freckensy deutsch and that and that's what we've been telling people about the people that have
[02:17:25.280 --> 02:17:30.320]  been walking up talking to us uh paul had an interesting um uh debate with a lady who was
[02:17:30.320 --> 02:17:34.480]  from england talking about the brexit and she was older and she's worried about her pension
[02:17:34.480 --> 02:17:39.360]  that's why she's gonna vote to stay in oh yeah they always hold you hostage you know oh give us
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:43.680]  a bailout or we'll implode you when they're the one screwing you over iceland get the bankers out
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:47.840]  doing great now and people don't realize there's not going to be a pension by the time that the
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:53.440]  pension's gone they're using the pension in germany to pay for the migrants okay and so and
[02:17:53.440 --> 02:17:58.640]  these police get out they on the side of the uh police cars it says come with us for a great job
[02:17:58.640 --> 02:18:03.200]  they think they're going to get a pension it's gone buddy no they'll find out i mean just like
[02:18:03.200 --> 02:18:06.880]  with 20 million germans got killed in world war two following orders is going to get you in a really
[02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:12.320]  bad position and i just feel sorry for them well listen huge success man uh info wars videos and
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:17.600]  reports are all over the news top story on drudgereport.com global government's been openly discussed

[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:54.240]  looks at drudge not just you know libertarians and patriots and then it forces the media to cover it
[02:18:54.240 --> 02:18:59.760]  it's just a huge deal do i mean top story on drudge yeah no and and that wakes up more people
[02:18:59.760 --> 02:19:02.960]  more people go wow what is bill derberg and then they start thinking about and go wait

[02:24:31.200 --> 02:24:34.880]  this first clip of course is jamie fox of heroes ago saying barack obama
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:41.360]  is the lord and savior and then we've got a clip of the media basically telling everybody that we
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:46.240]  must recognize this is historical that she's a woman total gimmick no she's a criminal
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:53.200]  no it doesn't matter what her race or what sex you can't make us bow down to her because she's
[02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:58.160]  a woman and use this gimmick then we cut to a minute and a half of her being accepted and
[02:24:58.160 --> 02:25:02.960]  her coming out on stage is a goddess if you're not a radio listener you got to go to infoworse.com
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:09.120]  forward slash show to look at the video a huge joker smile uh princess lay a goddess outfit
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:13.920]  like she's being worshiped and then they blur everything like she's on fire
[02:25:13.920 --> 02:25:18.720]  i mean this is ritualistic this is bizarre this is them trying to set her up like a
[02:25:18.720 --> 02:25:22.160]  dictator i mean what a freak show uh so let's go to that first clip
[02:25:32.720 --> 02:25:39.120]  now here they are introducing our new lord and savior with a unified across the media from fox
[02:25:39.120 --> 02:25:46.640]  news to cnn the same talking point here it is did you hear it it's the sound of that glass
[02:25:46.640 --> 02:25:50.880]  ceiling breaking no matter what side of the political aisle you're on it's an incredible and
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:55.680]  a historic moment again no matter your politics and i think we can all admit no matter what your
[02:25:55.680 --> 02:26:02.400]  politics are in this situation no matter who you you you support this is a very historic moment
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:08.720]  adam no matter what your politics this is a historic moment regardless of your politics
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:13.600]  this is a historic moment you know with all the back and forth over sanders and clinton and
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:17.440]  trump and everything on the republican side can we just take a second to stop and recognize
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:22.800]  history regardless of where you stand politically tonight is a very special night for women in this
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:28.320]  country and some residents this morning are saying that regardless of politics they are proud
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:35.040]  that their local girl has made history whatever your politics are we need to mark this moment
[02:26:35.040 --> 02:26:40.080]  in american history what however you feel about her like this is certainly she she
[02:26:40.080 --> 02:26:44.000]  claimed her place in history no matter what side of the aisle you're on there's no denying
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:47.600]  hillary clinton has made history whatever you think about hillary clinton whatever you think
[02:26:47.600 --> 02:26:52.640]  about her politics an important moment for the nation now that's enough just turn it off please
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:58.560]  that's the wash and free big and do a great job there so with a compilation what we're seeing here
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:06.640]  here is total brainwashing that was simultaneously as it happened they had that all pre-written
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:12.080]  ready to push that that this is for women yeah how's that multi thousand percentage point increase
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:17.040]  in breast cancer doing for you in the west oh this historic day for women how's all the infertility
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:23.440]  doing for you how's the extra work hours be treated like trash working for you because the
[02:27:23.440 --> 02:27:30.320]  whole women's movement the last 80 years have been run by ebb and the cia doesn't mean we shouldn't
[02:27:31.120 --> 02:27:35.520]  try to look at the roles of men women in society but they're getting rid of roles for humans and
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:44.640]  the machines are coming now let's now look at a compilation of hillary coming out on stage
[02:27:44.640 --> 02:27:50.240]  and being worshiped and then leaning back at a princess lay outfit and cnn blurring the footage
[02:27:50.240 --> 02:27:56.000]  and then cnn came out and called her a god and a goddess who was being worshiped these i mean

[02:29:59.760 --> 02:30:05.440]  the bill deberg 2016 public agenda says they won't be talking about the usual items like china
[02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:11.120]  russia the middle east technology but there's one new item the precariat it's a term coined by a
[02:30:11.120 --> 02:30:17.920]  uk economist to describe what he sees as the precarious proletariat he calls him a dangerous
[02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:23.120]  class of people who've been harmed by globalism according to his book which is one of only 10
[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:27.920]  subjects to be covered at bill deberg he breaks down society into several classes under the small
[02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:32.560]  number of super rich elite who are meeting at bill deberg are the salatarian then there's the
[02:30:32.560 --> 02:30:39.440]  professional technicians he calls proficient then we come to the dangerous ones the precariat who work
[02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:45.600]  menial low-paying jobs so how do the elite propose to control the precariat that he says are an
[02:30:45.600 --> 02:30:51.040]  incipient political monster while he proposes giving every legal resident of a country money
[02:30:51.040 --> 02:30:57.680]  without a job to create a permanent dependent class what hg wells called the eloy for info wars

[02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:24.160]  we're seeing reporters arrested people harassed uh british tourists with signs saying what's
[02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:32.400]  happening in the building being detained their bags ransacked their signs and property stolen
[02:33:34.240 --> 02:33:39.520]  i'll tell you this is really a frightening time to see the tyranny that is unfolding all across
[02:33:39.520 --> 02:33:45.120]  the world when you attempt to expose globalists and their corporate operations to establish a
[02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:50.640]  private corporate planetary government the good news is info wars dot com and our breakdown of this
[02:33:50.640 --> 02:33:57.600]  is the top story on drudge and right above it in the same block is mainstream newspapers and
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:02.640]  publications from the uk to the us admitting okay they're setting up world government okay
[02:34:02.640 --> 02:34:08.240]  they want to shut down free speech okay they want to shut down donald trump world planners meet
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:15.840]  in secret to discuss the british exit migrants trump on the menu reporters chased away and and
[02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:20.880]  worse and that is the biggest link on the internet right there so it's being forced out in the open
[02:34:20.880 --> 02:34:25.600]  that is so exciting and somebody's been helping do that for years charlie skelton the london guardian
[02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:29.040]  he was somewhat of a critic of it i know seven eight years ago whenever it was we went to turk here
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:34.800]  and they arrested him and took his stuff and treated him like crap over and over and he went
[02:34:34.800 --> 02:34:39.680]  wow this really is tyrannical so he's uh gone from being somewhat of a comedic journalist
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:43.680]  who's very popular to be more serious on the at least on that subject we're going to talk to
[02:34:43.680 --> 02:34:50.160]  him here about a minute and a half uh before we go any further uh here today we have a great sponsor

[02:35:43.200 --> 02:35:48.640]  we only had it one time we've got like 20 products down in forestlife.com we just
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:52.480]  get the top scientists top researchers bringing the very best organic clean
[02:35:53.760 --> 02:36:00.080]  triple tested products and living defense is harmful organism cleansing 120 big horse
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:06.160]  capsules that their powder form to absorb them what is it something like 30 different
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:11.440]  herbs and compounds that are known to knock out parasites just across the board a lot of these
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:16.080]  things have been used for thousands of years to knock out parasites some of these are the
[02:36:16.080 --> 02:36:22.640]  latest developments uh in in cleanly doing it and this thing was such a sleeper it sold out
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:26.960]  in two days it's taken us six months to get all these ingredients again have them all tested
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:31.120]  have them all be organic have them all be at california standards that's meant to be impossible
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:36.800]  and when you purchase it it funds the operation so for yourself your children you name it it's
[02:36:36.800 --> 02:36:41.360]  all seen as you know healthy and safe to do but always check with your physician because who knows
[02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:45.840]  what other you know situations you may personally have it's discounted even though it's a product
[02:36:45.840 --> 02:36:51.120]  we sell out of normally $44 it's $34 right now it's almost got five stars and third party
[02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:58.160]  review sites that we have linked infowarslife.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and i'm very very
[02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:03.520]  excited that we got triple the amount we got six months ago but that will probably still sell out
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:08.080]  in a couple weeks that's a good problem to have but it's very expensive to be able to send you
[02:37:08.080 --> 02:37:12.960]  know three reporters to germany and send you know five reporters the last week to california to
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:18.000]  cover the primaries we're having a big effect but it's very expensive so thank you for buying the
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:24.240]  hillary for prison shirts mull on lave shirts uh you know genetic roulette books and videos on how
[02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:29.120]  dangerous gmo is people say are you liberal or conservative i'm just a populist common sense
[02:37:29.120 --> 02:37:32.800]  you got a bunch of world government people meeting in secret they're acting like reporters of the
[02:37:32.800 --> 02:37:36.960]  criminals and i'm just proud of my crew and others having the courage to be out there now
[02:37:39.280 --> 02:37:44.800]  speaking of courage charlie skelton has a lot of courage because they target him i've got to say
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:50.400]  six seven i don't know time flies years that he's been covering milderberg
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:55.680]  because he's with probably the biggest newspaper arguably in the world it's not even the new york
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:02.960]  times all over europe it's the big english you know language paper folks read uh and he's able to
[02:38:02.960 --> 02:38:09.200]  actually cover it the guardian lets him cover real issues because they know that's how you remain
[02:38:09.200 --> 02:38:16.000]  credible in my view uh and so so the police and governmental people know that he's you know high
[02:38:16.000 --> 02:38:20.240]  powered and i'm kind of speaking for him i haven't had private conversations with him on this so i've
[02:38:20.240 --> 02:38:26.240]  been at billerberg for three or four times with him he's a great guy he and his wife but am i correct
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:29.840]  in saying they target you charlie i know you didn't come on about this today you came on to tell us
[02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:33.440]  about what you witnessed the last few days and his billerberg officially kicked off it just seems
[02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:38.960]  like every year and my crew was saying this they seem to target you detain you arrest you raid your
[02:38:38.960 --> 02:38:44.880]  hotel rooms harass you uh try to get your rental cars taken away i mean is that an accurate statement
[02:38:44.880 --> 02:38:50.320]  and why are they coming after you if it is an accurate statement well first of all hello alex
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:55.840]  it's lovely to be here good to have you you're looking well looking very smart um uh well this
[02:38:55.840 --> 02:39:01.040]  year hasn't been as bad as last year i have to say uh last year was pretty bad uh the austrian police
[02:39:01.040 --> 02:39:08.160]  were were pretty tough uh but this year the german police you know there's not much dialogue going on
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:14.320]  and and yes i was we were held up for you know three quarters of an hour last night you know
[02:39:14.320 --> 02:39:20.000]  the usual checks and and this that and the other and and i know i have to be honest there have been
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:24.880]  other people this year who had it worse so you know which i have to sound glad about uh on a purely
[02:39:24.880 --> 02:39:32.240]  selfish uh basis um but uh really what i think i have to say the story this year for me is the
[02:39:32.240 --> 02:39:37.360]  number of politicians have come it's a very very political summit and uh you know people don't
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:41.520]  don't realize that it's a lot of people i don't know what they think it is but when you look at
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:45.600]  the the the the sheer number of politicians here you have to treat it as a political summit i mean
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:51.520]  three members of the german cabinet here you know two prime ministers and uh you know four
[02:39:51.520 --> 02:39:57.040]  finance ministers including the canadian finance minister and there's a it's a high-level political
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:04.160]  summit but one that's thrown by you know dutchabank and airbus you know it's a it's a it's a lobbying
[02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:11.680]  junk it a big intense one that that all these people come to um that that's um yeah that's that's
[02:40:11.680 --> 02:40:17.440]  as you say it's a globalist operation i mean it very definitely is break down
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:23.200]  from your perspective how bill de berg is changing because you talk about they're still powerful
[02:40:23.760 --> 02:40:30.720]  but they're a little more paranoid well one of the uh i think with the brexit the whole the
[02:40:30.720 --> 02:40:36.080]  whole brexit debate is is is something that concerns them because for various reasons it would um
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:42.960]  it would completely unplug the whole ttip trade deal um uh but worse than that it would just it
[02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:51.040]  would fragment this uh uh this this this building block of of the european union which is it's part
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:58.720]  of the when i say they i mean the kind of you know globalists um uh ideologues of that of that
[02:40:58.720 --> 02:41:07.840]  particular ilk um they it would it would be a a dangerous fracture of of that um of that kind
[02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:12.960]  of free trade and political bloc and they talk about the serious consequences and the dangers
[02:41:12.960 --> 02:41:19.840]  a lot of the people here have in dresden have spoken out uh for example uh honoree de castries
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:23.840]  the chairman of bill de berg you know he talks about the serious consequences of brexit a lot
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:30.560]  of them do uh thomas ender's the head of airbus uh who's pretty much playing host here uh he he's
[02:41:30.560 --> 02:41:36.400]  he's talked about lobbying for brexit uh against you know sorry against brexit for for the remain
[02:41:37.200 --> 02:41:43.040]  people and and the remain campaign has has had money from goldman sacks and jp move and goldman
[02:41:43.040 --> 02:41:48.800]  sacks union i keep i've had a conversation myself with uh a director of goldman sacks he was having
[02:41:48.800 --> 02:41:55.360]  a glass of wine last night and i went up and said hello um like i said do you uh would you mind having
[02:41:55.360 --> 02:42:00.400]  a um a press conference that would be nice um and he said he'd pass it on so whether or not he will
[02:42:00.400 --> 02:42:06.320]  i hope he does well let's remember charlie skelton again one and guardian that just five six seven
[02:42:06.320 --> 02:42:12.240]  years ago some mainstream media was saying bill de berg didn't exist so yeah this is a huge victory
[02:42:12.240 --> 02:42:16.800]  for independent real press that now at least they admit it exists and then to a great extent it is
[02:42:16.800 --> 02:42:22.320]  as important as davos it's just basically a private davos that predates davos i mean that's
[02:42:22.320 --> 02:42:29.280]  how i put it absolutely and i think if you look at the press you can see uh there's a definite
[02:42:29.280 --> 02:42:34.640]  change you know year by year you get more pieces in the mainstream press that treat it seriously
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:41.520]  more pieces that that that do an analysis of the list that um the participant list that look at uh
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:49.520]  that look at it as a kind of political commercial um uh private summit that critique it in terms of
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:56.400]  transparency uh and lobbying and and that the language i think is changing and it's veering
[02:42:56.400 --> 02:43:01.360]  away from a kind of easy description of it as a conspiracy theory or something which you still
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:07.840]  get but you get less of and more simply journalists treating it for what it is which is a an extremely
[02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:14.080]  high-powered commercially paid for globalist summit so yes i think there's a change from the
[02:43:14.080 --> 02:43:19.840]  point of view of um the media for the good and in terms of bill de berg itself i think it's
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:25.200]  fascinating to see how over the last few years they have shifted towards uh silicon valley and
[02:43:25.200 --> 02:43:29.680]  towards uh new technology you know the people that you see on their board of direct uh on the
[02:43:29.680 --> 02:43:36.400]  steering committee are people like eric schmidt from google and uh uh pete teal who's uh on the
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:41.920]  board of facebook and they've just brought in alex carp who runs palantir um which is chaired by
[02:43:41.920 --> 02:43:46.880]  pete teal um which is the big uh kind of data mining and data analysis company uh which was
[02:43:46.880 --> 02:43:53.440]  set up with cia money um so and in fact they're bringing in google deepmine people uh like denise
[02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:59.600]  hasubis who runs google deepmine and and they've got someone who's the co-chairman of open ai so
[02:44:00.240 --> 02:44:05.360]  artificial intelligence and and and data mining and data analysis and big data that's been
[02:44:05.360 --> 02:44:10.000]  a thing for the last few years so what you can see is that bill de berg is not really this old
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:14.880]  buddy daddy group of people you know they're passing the baton on to the technocrats and i'm glad
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:18.960]  you raised this because you talk about their you know they want to be in the future but they're
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:22.960]  obsessed with the past with one of your headlines earlier this week so let's talk about that they
[02:44:22.960 --> 02:44:27.520]  admit they want a technocracy they call themselves technocrats unelected they're going to decide
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:30.720]  they're going to feed us what data they want they're going to control the future these are all
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:35.680]  statements they're handing the baton to the zookerbergs and the schmitz of the world uh who
[02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:40.480]  are there so we really see the old guard on the skexies collapsing into dust handing the
[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:45.520]  scepters i mean is that an accurate way to basically boil us down yeah i wouldn't say they
[02:44:45.520 --> 02:44:49.600]  you know some of them fade away but you know Kissinger is still here he's 93 i've just saw
[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:57.520]  him arrive um so if you look at some of the older guys people like jacob wollenberg they are they
[02:44:57.520 --> 02:45:03.120]  run huge industrial conglomerates um and and they're still extremely powerful all of these are
[02:45:03.120 --> 02:45:06.720]  families like the wollenberg family of course they're powerful i'm just saying they're betting
[02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:12.720]  everything on technocracy and kind of handing the control over to the technocrats they're definitely
[02:45:12.720 --> 02:45:16.800]  betting on technology and technocracy i mean without a doubt um because apart from anything else
[02:45:16.800 --> 02:45:21.440]  they're not idiots they you know they're smart people and they want to be smart but you know
[02:45:21.440 --> 02:45:28.240]  because being smart for them means keeping you know keeping i would say in control is perhaps
[02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:31.760]  sure why do you think they wanted to keep it secret for over 50 years and what do you think
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:40.320]  they think of failing now it's it's an odd one isn't that um i think they have they've they've
[02:45:40.320 --> 02:45:44.960]  pushed the media away for so long that the media of kind the mainstream media got out of the habit
[02:45:44.960 --> 02:45:49.360]  of speaking about Bilderberg they sort of forgot that it existed then became a little bit of an
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:53.840]  embarrassment almost because it is an embarrassment to be quite honest it is embarrassing that the
[02:45:53.840 --> 02:45:59.360]  mainstream media still to a large degree don't turn up but you know they're still writing about it
[02:45:59.360 --> 02:46:04.160]  and i tell you what's a really good sign is that um the agencies are here so we've got getty images
[02:46:04.160 --> 02:46:09.360]  and we've got uh Reuters who are here taking photographs and feeding them into the kind of
[02:46:09.360 --> 02:46:14.480]  press pool of stuff that floats around so at least the the newspapers that are too
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:18.880]  that can't quite be bothered to come here can at least take the photographs and then write around
[02:46:18.880 --> 02:46:23.200]  it so you know it's all i would say it's it's changing for the good and you know the more
[02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:29.120]  everyone like you and and and Luke Rudowski and dandix and everyone who comes and and talks about
[02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:35.040]  everyone that that keeps the subject ticking over and in the public consciousness and and in the
[02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:40.400]  media consciousness all of that is is hugely important because you know absolutely they clearly
[02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:45.360]  don't like publicity and in fact what's interesting is that it's hotel that sat this year has got two
[02:46:45.360 --> 02:46:52.160]  entrances and all of the politicians with i think about one exception have come in in the in the
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:59.280]  blocked out limos uh and they've been swept into the back door down into the underground garage
[02:46:59.280 --> 02:47:04.480]  with no chance of being photographed and you know it's been the industrialists and the financiers
[02:47:04.480 --> 02:47:10.000]  that have come in the front door because they kind of don't care um so you know in an age where
[02:47:10.000 --> 02:47:14.400]  politicians talk so easily about transparency it's kind of pathetic that's right very senior
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:17.920]  politicians are hiding like this and i think what you hit on mr. skelton again the one in
[02:47:17.920 --> 02:47:23.680]  guardian is so key charles kelton joining us the guardian dot com is that politicians have always
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:27.520]  denied this even existed or the tony blare bill clinton got vetted there or hillary got vetted
[02:47:27.520 --> 02:47:31.680]  there obama got vetted there i mean i was there i saw the secret service drive in they aimed mp5
[02:47:31.680 --> 02:47:36.000]  tecler you know machine guns at me i experienced i got it on tape you know and they still said
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:40.160]  didn't happen new york times it's just such a collapse of the wasabi you point out the political
[02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:44.640]  class looking at the list they always try to stay off the list but more and more as you pointed out
[02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:49.200]  this year it appears to be almost purely political normally it's all about big business deals or
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:54.000]  there's about to be a new war a bunch of generals or some of the soddies are there now the chinese
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:57.760]  are hardly ever there showing they've been kind of kicked out of things so you can really see this
[02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:02.400]  is so political what do you think's behind that from your sources or just your resource i mean is
[02:48:02.400 --> 02:48:06.880]  it trying to keep britain in the euro is it because of europe and so much trouble with the migrant thing
[02:48:06.880 --> 02:48:11.120]  i mean what do you think makes this so political this year instead of just managing you know the
[02:48:11.120 --> 02:48:14.880]  next political move it seems what does it signify to have so many politicians there
[02:48:16.080 --> 02:48:21.200]  well i think it signifies to me that that the the power base of bill deberg which is
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:28.400]  broadly speaking one of transnational banks and and and oil companies and and industrial
[02:48:28.400 --> 02:48:37.440]  conglomerates so shell oil bp goldman sacks hsbc these giant financial entities clearly want to
[02:48:37.440 --> 02:48:42.080]  keep their consensus going they want to keep their their worldview in play so that means
[02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:46.320]  that a lot of politicians there they may be having trouble keeping everybody in line or maybe they're
[02:48:46.320 --> 02:48:52.000]  trying to make sure they follow the plan exactly or what is what i mean you know you know at one
[02:48:52.000 --> 02:48:57.120]  level who knows because you know we don't get to the politicians that come don't generally
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:49:01.120]  report back on it and you know for example our chance of the exchequer george osborne goes
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:06.320]  regularly he's not here this year but he does regularly go and he he reports back in his transparency
[02:49:06.320 --> 02:49:13.360]  data and i use the phrase advisedly um with the phrase uh uh general discussion that's all he
[02:49:13.360 --> 02:49:18.560]  that's all he admits happened at the uh at bill deberg general discussion it's a bit like when
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:22.480]  you look at their list of topics and they have current events you know that isn't telling us
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:26.560]  anything and it's kind of a slap in the face for anyone that values sure remember what from four
[02:49:26.560 --> 02:49:30.640]  years ago they were denying the prime minister was going or was it three and then here he comes
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:36.240]  you know riding straight in yeah yeah well tony blare tony blare lied to parliament about going
[02:49:36.240 --> 02:49:41.760]  and then was caught on camera uh by lute radouski actually who who put him on the spot he went oh
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:47.280]  yes actually it was a very useful meeting yes i was there in 1993 that's years after having lied
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:52.800]  to parliament about going i mean i'm hoping you know i live in hope that the more attention the more
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:59.280]  i'm chipping away we we do uh this story the more we can hold it into in the kind of media and public
[02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:05.680]  consciousness so that politicians will just be more inclined to behave like adults and and behave
[02:50:05.680 --> 02:50:12.080]  like you know representative democracy you know representation exactly and transparency gonna
[02:50:12.080 --> 02:50:16.640]  make them transpires gonna make them act better that's why they don't want transparency absolutely
[02:50:16.640 --> 02:50:21.280]  yeah i mean that's it transparency puts it it puts them on the spot and it holds them to account
[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:25.200]  you know the last thing a politician wants is to be held to account charlie skelton is our guest
[02:50:25.200 --> 02:50:28.640]  theguardian.com we have one more short segment with him in the fourth hour starts with anthony
[02:50:28.640 --> 02:50:31.920]  gertiarty coming in we come back i want to just let you talk about whatever you think is most
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:35.040]  important instead of me asking questions but also get into what what else do you think is on the
[02:50:35.040 --> 02:50:39.520]  agenda that's not on this list what is this list that they put out tell you about what's coming up
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:44.160]  charlie skelton with elon and guardian one of the first if not the first big uh international
[02:50:44.160 --> 02:50:50.080]  publications even admit bill berg existed okay and again a lot of that is so much because drudge
[02:50:50.080 --> 02:50:54.960]  about a decade ago began to link to our articles at info wars dot com this isn't about credit here
[02:50:54.960 --> 02:50:58.480]  but it's about realizing the evolution of awakening and that we're winning

[02:53:08.960 --> 02:53:14.400]  see major power grid problems and it's getting worse so please listen solar generators really do
[02:53:14.400 --> 02:53:19.840]  provide lifesaving electrical power and unlike gas generators solar generators run silently
[02:53:19.840 --> 02:53:24.880]  emit no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun whether it's dangerous summer storms
[02:53:24.880 --> 02:53:29.920]  blackouts intensifying civil unrest you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of

[02:54:15.680 --> 02:54:20.000]  next hour i'm going to ride shotgun into the next hour withing and anthony will also be opening
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:25.200]  the phones up charlie skelton's our guest okay charlie skelton the guardian over in dresden germany
[02:54:25.200 --> 02:54:29.760]  covering what's happening i think we agree unprecedented coverage unprecedented missions
[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:37.200]  that big decisions are being made there what else is uh on your radar screen right now well i would
[02:54:37.200 --> 02:54:44.320]  say that it's uh a statement made um by the chairman of bill debauchery de castries uh
[02:54:44.320 --> 02:54:49.600]  who's the guy tipped to be the new head of hsbc one of the world's largest banks he said recently
[02:54:49.600 --> 02:54:56.320]  he was asked recently uh an interview does privacy exist no no so now he was asked is
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:00.720]  privacy dead that's right he was asked is privacy dead and he looked he looked at the ghania yes
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:07.120]  and what's very interesting is that they think they i'm talking about some of the elites here
[02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:12.400]  at bill de berg treat privacy as something which has kind of for most of us evaporated
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:18.640]  and yet for them we only have to look out the window and see the the light the rows and rows of
[02:55:18.640 --> 02:55:26.000]  police fans and the concrete the concrete walls privacy is absolutely alive and well and thriving
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:31.760]  at bill de berg but for us you know they have they're people like alex carp as i said from from
[02:55:31.760 --> 02:55:37.840]  palantir whose job is one of the world's largest private companies their their their software is
[02:55:38.560 --> 02:55:44.000]  designed to crunch our data that we're freely just spouting out in every which way create algorithms
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:49.680]  exactly so you've got a board member of facebook here peter teal you know this is it's all about
[02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:54.080]  and you know and obviously eric schmidt from google so that's the right point schmidt makes his
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:58.480]  girlfriends wear hoods over their heads zuckerberg's buying up his whole neighborhood so nobody can
[02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:03.680]  look at him they're obsessed with secrecy and have the police harassing the press and then they
[02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:09.600]  and then they're all spying on us yeah yeah absolutely i mean they but it worse than spying
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:14.720]  on us they think it's dead they think that the argument is over they think you know when i say
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:20.240]  there i'm when i'm quoting the chairman of bill de berg i think it's fair to say they he thinks at
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:25.680]  least that the privacy is dead it's over so we're living in a world post-privacy world so they're
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:30.880]  killing our privacy using our data against it and then giving themselves like royalty exemption
[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:34.880]  from it absolutely and it's a very technocratic structure if you think about it you know it's
[02:56:34.880 --> 02:56:39.680]  it's a sort of it's like soviet russia there's the elite or east germany you know it's the elite
[02:56:39.680 --> 02:56:45.440]  who know everything and the and the the rest of us who get spied on and uh you know the difference is
[02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:50.000]  in west germany a guy had to sit there listening at the keyhole or whatever and here we're just
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:58.560]  throwing open our our lives to to to data crunching company sure i know on german tv because i follow
[02:56:58.560 --> 02:57:02.960]  it something like they've all these shows about the stasi and how bad it was and who and and then
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:08.240]  they admit it's like hundreds of times worse now and it's like oh it's okay yeah absolutely and
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:14.320]  but uh you know it's it's an argument i think that needs to be really ignited no you know what i mean
[02:57:14.320 --> 02:57:18.000]  you always have the best arguments i mean you're at you're absolutely right they're total hypocrites
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:23.520]  totally and you know and it's kind of annoying that you know we talk about transparency you know
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:28.000]  politicians are meant to be transparent and yet structures like political structures like bill de
[02:57:28.000 --> 02:57:35.120]  berg carry on as totally happily as ever and just as powerful if not more than ever so yeah it's it's
[02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:38.800]  a kind of a slight and they use all their inside data they admit to game the markets to rig the
[02:57:38.800 --> 02:57:43.200]  stock markets the currency they admit just everything's rigged they take all our data they screw us
[02:57:43.200 --> 02:57:48.880]  over and then our taxes pay to have paramilitary police are asked the press yeah absolutely and
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:53.600]  you've got they they they will engage in things like live or fraud and and a lot of banking fraud
[02:57:53.600 --> 02:57:59.280]  and they you know the guy who anyway there's people here who've been implicated in these things um so

[03:02:00.320 --> 03:02:10.000]  say back at night back in 2007 i was sitting there and i go and i hear willy knows this
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:13.040]  year willy knows this year in the pack crowd like it was only 300 the theater was you know

[03:03:02.960 --> 03:03:11.200]  there i'm gonna stop at that story i can't tell it there's too many good ones there's too many
[03:03:11.200 --> 03:03:16.240]  good ones about hanging out with a jesse ventura and willy nelson too that's a really good story
[03:03:16.240 --> 03:03:21.600]  hung out with those two together a few times i didn't mean to digress off into hollywood i don't
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:27.520]  care about hollywood i don't care about but if i like an artist like a musician or an or a painter
[03:03:27.520 --> 03:03:33.440]  or an architect or a writer or a researcher i love him but who i really love are people that have
[03:03:33.440 --> 03:03:37.440]  courage because that's what why i love donald trump despite the fact i disagree with some of
[03:03:37.440 --> 03:03:42.000]  the things he's done the whole power structure is after him and lying about him and saying he hates
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:46.240]  mexicans because they took it out of context where he goes this judge is a mexican i admire him
[03:03:46.240 --> 03:03:50.000]  that he's a nationalist and cares about his country and his people but he's not an american
[03:03:50.640 --> 03:03:54.560]  and they said oh because he's not him because he's not what anglo no that's not what he said
[03:03:55.920 --> 03:04:00.640]  the judge is in two la raza groups and his group boycotts trump
[03:04:00.640 --> 03:04:12.400]  look if you want to be a member of la raza that's your business i'm not a member of the kkk
[03:04:13.600 --> 03:04:16.880]  and i don't care if people in la raza go and i don't a lot of folks listening you probably had a
[03:04:16.880 --> 03:04:20.400]  mom or dad that was in it you're in college they say you've been oppressed i'm sure somebody did
[03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:23.520]  something to your wrong that's how the world works and then how you're gonna be part of this
[03:04:23.520 --> 03:04:30.880]  chicano studies and it's all funded by the cia and the rest of it and it's just meant to absolutely
[03:04:31.760 --> 03:04:36.640]  sit there and put a chip on your shoulder i grew up in dallas texas okay and i had rednecks and
[03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:40.640]  black people constantly starting fights with me just because they were looking for a fight
[03:04:42.160 --> 03:04:46.720]  and and and i did have fights with mexicans too but but the least amount and and the mexicans all
[03:04:46.720 --> 03:04:51.040]  know that they know green goes on average are leaving people alone they'll try to marry you or
[03:04:51.040 --> 03:04:56.080]  try to go you know eat at your restaurant but it's just all made up and donald trump is not
[03:04:56.080 --> 03:05:01.520]  racist and it's a load of bull we're gonna talk about when we come back the bill deberg 2016 public
[03:05:01.520 --> 03:05:06.880]  agenda says they will be talking about the usual items like china russia the middle east technology
[03:05:06.880 --> 03:05:13.040]  but there's one new item the precarious it's a term coined by a uk economist to describe what he
[03:05:13.040 --> 03:05:19.840]  sees as the precarious proletariat he calls him a dangerous class of people who've been harmed by
[03:05:19.840 --> 03:05:24.800]  globalism according to his book which is one of only 10 subjects to be covered at bill deberg he
[03:05:24.800 --> 03:05:29.680]  breaks down society into several classes under the small number of super rich elite who are meeting
[03:05:29.680 --> 03:05:35.840]  at bill deberg are the salateria then there's the professional technicians he calls proficient then
[03:05:35.840 --> 03:05:42.000]  we come to the dangerous ones the precariat who work menial low paying jobs so how do the elite
[03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:48.160]  propose to control the precariat that he says are an incipient political monster while he proposes
[03:05:48.160 --> 03:05:53.920]  giving every legal resident of a country money without a job to create a permanent dependent

[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:22.560]  this is intent the globalists are out to get us now coming up at the bottom of the hour um anthony
[03:09:22.560 --> 03:09:27.600]  uti already has requested that they air an 11 minute boil down the last time drudge was here in town
[03:09:28.640 --> 03:09:32.800]  crazy because i guess great minds think alike or minds that want to be free think alike
[03:09:32.800 --> 03:09:36.560]  i requested like a three minute boil down a few days ago from one of the editors i didn't know he'd
[03:09:36.560 --> 03:09:40.080]  already done this for an 11 minute club he's gonna be airing that because it's just everything he
[03:09:40.080 --> 03:09:45.120]  talked about is now happening and it's just it's important because nine times out of ten it's a
[03:09:45.120 --> 03:09:50.000]  drudge alone who ends up taking topics that no one else would put in the mainstream media
[03:09:50.000 --> 03:09:54.800]  and forcing it out the pentagon says they can't stand it and really it's indicative of the death
[03:09:54.800 --> 03:10:00.400]  of the mainstream media and you can really say the facade's fully collapsing now we're reaching a
[03:10:00.400 --> 03:10:06.480]  point where it's got more holes in swiss cheese a six percent trust rate and ap polls but separately
[03:10:07.120 --> 03:10:13.200]  i try to the best job i can occasionally i get a wild hair i was about to go get my hair cut
[03:10:13.200 --> 03:10:19.440]  at like three o'clock yesterday and then come back to the office and i just had a wild idea
[03:10:20.720 --> 03:10:24.400]  and i decided to we're gonna air this a little bit later anything's gonna air but stuff on info
[03:10:24.400 --> 03:10:28.400]  wars dot com and i had this idea because i was looking at drudge and i was watching the super
[03:10:28.400 --> 03:10:34.160]  clip cut which we can roll behind me if you guys want of hillary on cnn leaning back in a goddess
[03:10:34.160 --> 03:10:39.840]  outfit like princess leah being worshiped and even cnn said she's a god she's a golden god is the
[03:10:39.840 --> 03:10:46.320]  quote history making golden god and it was the weird joker face she then flashed like a demon
[03:10:46.320 --> 03:10:51.120]  i mean i would put this in the in an exorcist movie where a demon possessed woman becomes president
[03:10:51.120 --> 03:10:57.600]  i mean this is hollywood level scary looking woman i mean she's super evil super creepy has the
[03:10:57.600 --> 03:11:04.960]  bones to prove it the whole background starts like like having an orgasm on stage and then just acting
[03:11:04.960 --> 03:11:10.000]  totally freakish and since i attacked this yesterday not even the leftist groups have
[03:11:10.000 --> 03:11:13.520]  attacked me back they normally do because they know it's fricking cult level
[03:11:16.080 --> 03:11:20.880]  i mean this this is this is out of control so here's just a short excerpt of it
[03:11:20.880 --> 03:11:22.880]  you
[03:11:34.080 --> 03:11:38.160]  don't show yet don't show the car taking me down that's coming up at the bottom of the hour ladies
[03:11:38.160 --> 03:11:46.240]  and gentlemen that's good oh my gosh oh my gosh and it all depends on a lot of people say man you
[03:11:46.240 --> 03:11:49.760]  look really skinny in some photos and you look a little bit chubby in those well i mean when
[03:11:49.760 --> 03:11:53.760]  jikari's holding you back with his arm around your neck because i we did it it's a skit it's fun
[03:11:53.760 --> 03:12:00.000]  it's obvious it's a skit it doesn't cut to a clip with me it's obviously fake like the hitler dog
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:05.120]  video okay i hope we don't get arrested for it pointing out that i'm suddenly worshiping hillary
[03:12:05.120 --> 03:12:10.320]  and have joined the cult and under her spell uh and what's the name of the video up on informers
[03:12:10.320 --> 03:12:15.840]  it's alex jones loses it has to be restrained by reporter there does alex jones flips out
[03:12:15.840 --> 03:12:19.760]  is physically restrained but i still lost a lot of weight there but when you're wearing you know

[03:12:35.680 --> 03:12:42.400]  have lost a ton of weight but i don't mean to digress off into that uh it's just that um i've
[03:12:42.400 --> 03:12:46.000]  been not drinking beer for a week or so so i'm gonna lose even more weight now but i don't even
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:49.840]  know where i'm going with all this just anthony good shiardi we've got to have some fun but i
[03:12:49.840 --> 03:12:54.720]  really want to ask the audience i don't do a lot of comedy whatever i do people say oh he's trying
[03:12:54.720 --> 03:13:01.520]  to fake us when it's obviously satire it was like jakari this morning was like yeah i don't get it
[03:13:01.520 --> 03:13:07.280]  a few years ago they said isis is going to assassinate dumbo as a hoax i think it was the onion
[03:13:07.280 --> 03:13:12.960]  and he goes people said oh my god i hope they don't kill dumbo or why did you hoax us saying
[03:13:12.960 --> 03:13:18.800]  they wanted to kill dumbo it's obvious you don't have to say satire on a 1940s disney character
[03:13:18.800 --> 03:13:26.720]  named dumbo it doesn't exist there is no flying elephant with giant pink ears there is a crazy
[03:13:26.720 --> 03:13:31.520]  texan with the body of a gorilla ripping his shirt off going hoax style which i didn't intend to do
[03:13:31.520 --> 03:13:35.280]  jikari kind of too quick because we only scripted it like in 30 seconds i said get over here with a
[03:13:35.280 --> 03:13:39.440]  camera say you're shooting a gun piece buckley runs in run on the hall you'll see what i'm doing
[03:13:39.440 --> 03:13:45.280]  jikari's like okay and i just said restrain me and so in one take we shot this whole thing like
[03:13:45.280 --> 03:13:50.400]  two minutes preparation it was insane i love doing like there's a bubble gun piece we did
[03:13:50.400 --> 03:13:53.920]  where i just said hey they're banning bubble guns they're arresting kids that have bubble guns
[03:13:54.560 --> 03:14:00.400]  my little kitty or hello kitty or whatever it is that's hello kitty from japan so i said we're
[03:14:00.400 --> 03:14:03.280]  gonna be in this board meeting i'm gonna pull a bubble gun out and then you're gonna freak out
[03:14:03.280 --> 03:14:07.760]  and stop me and that was that was no preparation there either so we're gonna rear a bubble gun
[03:14:07.760 --> 03:14:14.080]  uh today we have time as well but i tell you i'm a little bit euphoric uh here with paul watson
[03:14:14.080 --> 03:14:19.280]  and the rest of crew and drudge and everything that's happening how global government is absolutely
[03:14:19.280 --> 03:14:24.480]  getting a new you know what porn in it i mean i know victory when i see it and uh i think we've
[03:14:24.480 --> 03:14:28.160]  almost reached a champagne level event here uh anything you're jarring you know you're talking
[03:14:28.160 --> 03:14:32.080]  about people thinking that sad tires are real it's because we live in a headline society
[03:14:32.080 --> 03:14:37.040]  people can't actually process things for their themselves anymore and they just read the insane
[03:14:37.040 --> 03:14:40.720]  mainstream media it looks like the onion anyway you go on the mainstream media it's the most
[03:14:40.720 --> 03:14:45.680]  ridiculous stuff you could possibly imagine so they don't even think now oh that could be satire
[03:14:45.680 --> 03:14:51.600]  because everything's so insane anyway it's like already weird and already projected onto you
[03:14:51.600 --> 03:14:55.120]  and they just read the headlines and no one looks at the details yeah i guess that's it i mean
[03:14:55.120 --> 03:14:59.280]  jakari's laughing in the background i'm ripping my shirt off it's obviously a joke it's obviously a
[03:14:59.280 --> 03:15:04.240]  joke i watched it yesterday by the way it's really funny i do want to play it on here well i mean be
[03:15:04.240 --> 03:15:09.040]  honest with me do you i think it's okay jakari did a great job and i think it's real i think it's
[03:15:09.040 --> 03:15:13.440]  real let me just put it out there i think you're obviously a closeted hillary clinton supporter
[03:15:13.440 --> 03:15:17.840]  you caught me worshiping her uh you were caught worshiping her uh actually we should we shouldn't
[03:15:17.840 --> 03:15:21.920]  have said all that it's real ladies and gentlemen he was caught worshiping hillary you have to see
[03:15:21.920 --> 03:15:26.960]  the video i'm actually more impressed by the fact that you ripped the shirt off and it you know
[03:15:26.960 --> 03:15:31.280]  whole kogan had to get those stretchy shirts to rip off they had to make them custom for them so
[03:15:31.280 --> 03:15:35.760]  you could rip them off is that true it's true yeah whole kogan has uh shirts that were really hard
[03:15:35.760 --> 03:15:40.560]  that hard to rip a shirt off i've never done it but it seems pretty hard to me yeah seems pretty hard
[03:15:42.240 --> 03:15:46.640]  i thought i'd pull him for a minute it wasn't coming off i saw you just ripped it though he's
[03:15:46.640 --> 03:15:51.360]  got mad at it powerful no come on it's not that hard i was i don't know we'll have to try it well
[03:15:51.360 --> 03:15:55.840]  they actually are a thick quality shirts and it was a little bit harder than uh than uh some of the
[03:15:55.840 --> 03:16:00.080]  other you know he saved the shirt ripped off and video that shirt i am ripping off whole kogan
[03:16:00.080 --> 03:16:06.560]  and i'm ripping off uh whom are ricking off ripping off right now ladies and gentlemen
[03:16:07.840 --> 03:16:12.880]  coming up uh tell us what you've got coming up today anthony gitchardy well you know one of the
[03:16:12.880 --> 03:16:17.280]  weirdest things that no one seems to be doing anything about because it's a headline society
[03:16:17.280 --> 03:16:22.240]  and this is too complex you know we're all guilty of it though is oklahoma police you've talked
[03:16:22.240 --> 03:16:26.320]  about this a little bit but they can seize your entire bank account on a traffic stop without any
[03:16:26.320 --> 03:16:31.520]  charge no drugs no nothing nothing nothing just gonna suck the money out of your bank account but
[03:16:31.520 --> 03:16:35.520]  it's not just oklahoma so we're gonna talk about that they can pull you over and they could just
[03:16:35.520 --> 03:16:39.520]  say oh you know for nothing we should do a man on the street about this we should do a man on the
[03:16:39.520 --> 03:16:44.320]  street about saying they get millions of dollars in funding from this and in there's some groups
[03:16:44.320 --> 03:16:48.640]  that are talking about it but i've not heard any of the news program and there could be i just
[03:16:48.640 --> 03:16:52.720]  haven't heard it talk about this in depth like this they are taking money from people for doing
[03:16:52.720 --> 03:16:57.440]  nothing wrong and what sad is and what i want to talk about is i like the police i think you know i
[03:16:57.440 --> 03:17:00.800]  was looking at the other day there was a car accident now that's how they demonize the police
[03:17:00.800 --> 03:17:05.760]  is selling them on evil unconstitutional garbage which then they carry out destroying their own
[03:17:05.760 --> 03:17:10.080]  name yeah small percentage of the bad apples are going to do this and then it makes it look really
[03:17:10.080 --> 03:17:14.960]  bad but then they say oh it's okay for your funding it's okay these people are probably uh drug dealers
[03:17:14.960 --> 03:17:19.520]  anyway just take their money it goes to help well you talk about discrimination let's face it
[03:17:19.520 --> 03:17:23.840]  they're going to target illegal aliens and black people and folks because somehow this is the only
[03:17:23.840 --> 03:17:28.800]  racism i see left in the country is with poor whites blacks or Hispanics it's just kind of
[03:17:28.800 --> 03:17:32.880]  seem like as an asset for sure that's what they do it to now when it's an old lady an old Hispanic
[03:17:32.880 --> 03:17:36.480]  lady or old white lady or whatever then oh there'll be a big investigation because you know martha
[03:17:36.480 --> 03:17:41.440]  johnson hypothetical name and jane doe was an 82 year old Baptist preacher's wife when they took her
[03:17:41.440 --> 03:17:46.000]  $2,000 i mean they're dumb and utterly right these corrupt cops even don't have to rob old women
[03:17:46.000 --> 03:17:50.480]  you know so so let's face it they pull somebody over it's got five narcotics convictions in their
[03:17:50.480 --> 03:17:54.400]  view they're sick of the justice system being corrupt they're going to go ahead and just suck the money
[03:17:54.400 --> 03:18:00.080]  out but but but then that leads to really bad bad stuff then you can justify the kindness of people
[03:18:00.080 --> 03:18:03.760]  you can just find thing you're totally right there guess what there is real racism and we're against it
[03:18:04.400 --> 03:18:09.360]  we're against it there is real racism and that's a justification route though because yeah you can
[03:18:09.360 --> 03:18:13.840]  take the guy with the priors and take his cash but what do you do with racism i was at big bend and
[03:18:14.640 --> 03:18:19.520]  watch hispanic officers who are not like you know the normal tough cop officers you see whether
[03:18:19.520 --> 03:18:23.360]  they be white hispanic whatever they were like little communist guys and the things they were
[03:18:23.360 --> 03:18:27.840]  saying were right out of university and they were just arresting white people and leaving the Hispanics
[03:18:27.840 --> 03:18:32.000]  alone for drinking and i guess in their mind oh we're gonna we're gonna do it back to you now no
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:35.760]  how about we just don't act like this you know i've had mexican police shake me down for money
[03:18:35.760 --> 03:18:40.400]  because i'm a gringo but you know what they do it to mexicans too it's wrong no matter who you do it to
[03:18:41.440 --> 03:18:44.880]  we all need to go back to kindergarten i mean on the top of god i was ordered as a cop to arrest
[03:18:44.880 --> 03:18:50.480]  people drinking beer i would do i would absolutely arrest one white guy one hispanic guy you know i
[03:18:50.480 --> 03:18:54.000]  wouldn't just sit there and like only take the white people to jail or or give them tickets
[03:18:55.600 --> 03:18:59.440]  it's sickening man it's sickening i mean i would be sick if i was a white police officer and pulled
[03:18:59.440 --> 03:19:05.520]  over a black family and then suck the money out of their credit card what the hell is this think about
[03:19:05.520 --> 03:19:09.760]  that you really think about what they do too it's like something of the numbers here it's like
[03:19:09.760 --> 03:19:14.960]  47 million dollars or something and this just started a year ago yeah this is this is and it's
[03:19:14.960 --> 03:19:21.680]  not just Oklahoma imagine a poor family that's in the car with kids screaming crying and you're like
[03:19:21.680 --> 03:19:24.960]  i'm gonna have to take that i'm gonna have to take that what they say as well where'd you get this
[03:19:24.960 --> 03:19:29.040]  thousand dollars or what you're doing this i'm gonna go ahead and just you know usually they
[03:19:29.040 --> 03:19:34.400]  find a bunch of cash and they say we think it's drug related yep i'm gonna skip this break hi i
[03:19:34.400 --> 03:19:37.760]  just have to do it right now anthony do you want to just go ahead and play the insane piece now
[03:19:37.760 --> 03:19:42.080]  let's play the insane piece i like it so ladies and gentlemen this is real this is the real deal

[03:22:01.700 --> 03:22:04.700]  This is what happens when people lose their minds.
[03:22:05.700 --> 03:22:09.700]  He's been infected by Hillary, Rodham, Clinton.
[03:22:09.700 --> 03:22:12.700]  Don't let this happen to you. Get your Hillary for prison t-shirt today.
[03:22:12.700 --> 03:22:17.700]  Get your blasphemous Hillary for prison t-shirt before Hillary outlaws them.

[03:22:27.700 --> 03:22:29.700]  By the way, can you back it up to about 10 seconds for the end?
[03:22:29.700 --> 03:22:31.700]  I love how Jakari's in there. We're in this main studio.
[03:22:31.700 --> 03:22:34.700]  Right next door is David Knight who we didn't tell we were going to do this.
[03:22:34.700 --> 03:22:40.700]  Like right through the wall doing the show while we run around the fourth hour screaming and acting like morons.
[03:22:40.700 --> 03:22:42.700]  You know, like 255s when we shot it.
[03:22:42.700 --> 03:22:45.700]  And then later he's like, what's screaming? What's going on?
[03:22:45.700 --> 03:22:47.700]  He comes walking out.
[03:22:47.700 --> 03:22:50.700]  The real sitcom, the real reality show would be Mount Cameras in here.
[03:22:50.700 --> 03:22:52.700]  For the craziness that goes on, Anthony.
[03:22:52.700 --> 03:22:53.700]  Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
[03:22:53.700 --> 03:22:55.700]  And I like how the end is.
[03:22:55.700 --> 03:22:58.700]  Buy them before they sell out or before Alex destroys them all.
[03:22:58.700 --> 03:23:00.700]  It's the real threat.
[03:23:00.700 --> 03:23:01.700]  Yeah, so there's Jakari.
[03:23:01.700 --> 03:23:04.700]  Like, you know, talking about Alex being taken over by Hillary in the background.
[03:23:04.700 --> 03:23:06.700]  There's David Knight trying to finish the show.
[03:23:06.700 --> 03:23:10.700]  You can see him like putting his finger to the news. He was asking him like, oh, what's going on?
[03:23:10.700 --> 03:23:12.700]  Cause we're like, we should have told him.
[03:23:12.700 --> 03:23:17.700]  I'm like screaming at the top of my lungs and like right through that back wall is David Knight.
[03:23:17.700 --> 03:23:21.700]  Other people are like, what, what is going on?
[03:23:21.700 --> 03:23:23.700]  Oh, I'm actually crying. It's so funny.
[03:23:23.700 --> 03:23:26.700]  Let's get serious. It's how we find the operation.
[03:23:26.700 --> 03:23:28.700]  That is another limited edition shirt.
[03:23:28.700 --> 03:23:30.700]  It says till the end of time, that version's about to go.
[03:23:30.700 --> 03:23:31.700]  We're going to have a new one that doesn't say that.
[03:23:31.700 --> 03:23:36.700]  It says Hillary for president 2016 exact same design except red on the shoulder info wars.com
[03:23:36.700 --> 03:23:37.700]  to spread the word better.
[03:23:37.700 --> 03:23:41.700]  It'll keep it on the back as well info wars.com legalized freedom.
[03:23:41.700 --> 03:23:42.700]  And that helps fund this operation.
[03:23:42.700 --> 03:23:45.700]  I'm constantly, you know, plugging every hour.
[03:23:45.700 --> 03:23:48.700]  Most talk shows plug four or five times an hour during the show.
[03:23:48.700 --> 03:23:49.700]  And that's what you got to do.
[03:23:49.700 --> 03:23:50.700]  Talk radio is going bankrupt.
[03:23:50.700 --> 03:23:53.700]  The whole country's in crisis, but we just do it once or twice an hour.
[03:23:53.700 --> 03:23:56.700]  By the way, I didn't mean to do this, but Anthony tell folks about living defense.
[03:23:56.700 --> 03:24:00.700]  This sold out what in two days when it came in last year,
[03:24:00.700 --> 03:24:05.700]  I had no idea that the nutraceutical folks, the, the nutraceutical buffs,
[03:24:05.700 --> 03:24:09.700]  the nutraceutical vitamin mineral Nazis.
[03:24:09.700 --> 03:24:11.700]  I mean, that the sign fell away.
[03:24:11.700 --> 03:24:14.700]  Like, you know, the guy with the really good soups of soup, Nazi, but has weird roles.
[03:24:14.700 --> 03:24:18.700]  They really like it because they love Dr. Griffin when he does, but this thing's got one,
[03:24:18.700 --> 03:24:25.700]  two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21,
[03:24:25.700 --> 03:24:26.700]  two, two, three, four.
[03:24:26.700 --> 03:24:27.700]  Okay. 24 ingredients.
[03:24:27.700 --> 03:24:28.700]  I was saying close to 30.
[03:24:28.700 --> 03:24:32.700]  I was going off memory and you take one to three capsules a day,
[03:24:32.700 --> 03:24:35.700]  do a six week cleanse on this cause parasites get killed pretty quick,
[03:24:35.700 --> 03:24:38.700]  but then they, they have eggs and stuff and cyst,
[03:24:38.700 --> 03:24:42.700]  but most parasites are gone within six weeks and completed their life cycle several times.
[03:24:42.700 --> 03:24:45.700]  And boy folks take this, the reviews are unbelievable,
[03:24:45.700 --> 03:24:48.700]  but I had no idea this would become like out of the gates,
[03:24:48.700 --> 03:24:53.700]  one of the number one detox anti parasite harmful organism cleanses out there.
[03:24:53.700 --> 03:24:57.700]  We finally got more of it in because there's so many ingredients to get them all organic,
[03:24:57.700 --> 03:25:00.700]  all tested, all California standard is really hard.
[03:25:00.700 --> 03:25:01.700]  Yeah.
[03:25:01.700 --> 03:25:06.700]  I mean, they set the bar where the air is dirtier than, you know, what they allow or an apple is toxic.
[03:25:06.700 --> 03:25:10.700]  And so now it's here and you folks, everybody should do this cleanse.
[03:25:10.700 --> 03:25:16.700]  Now this is all seen as safe, you know, grass by the FDA, but still talk to your talk to your,
[03:25:16.700 --> 03:25:17.700]  that's a law.
[03:25:17.700 --> 03:25:18.700]  So it's called grass.
[03:25:18.700 --> 03:25:22.700]  Meaning it's, it's seen as in the safe vitamin and mineral and supplement or body.
[03:25:22.700 --> 03:25:24.700]  We don't sell stuff that isn't in that group,
[03:25:24.700 --> 03:25:29.700]  but you should still talk to your physician because hey, you may need a physician's note to breathe oxygen.
[03:25:29.700 --> 03:25:32.700]  The UN says, you know, the carbon dioxide is evil too,

[03:25:40.700 --> 03:25:42.700]  Look at what we're doing at Bilderberg.
[03:25:42.700 --> 03:25:45.700]  Look what we're doing covering the riots and the anti Trump stuff.
[03:25:45.700 --> 03:25:50.700]  It's info war so many times is a game changer because of the amplifier.
[03:25:50.700 --> 03:25:52.700]  A lot of times drudge report.
[03:25:52.700 --> 03:25:55.700]  I'm proud of the fact sometimes we're able to change the course of things without drudge linking,
[03:25:55.700 --> 03:25:58.700]  but drudge, you know, is on the same team of liberty.
[03:25:58.700 --> 03:26:00.700]  So it's a great dynamic duo, drudgereport.com.
[03:26:00.700 --> 03:26:02.700]  But I mean, talk about living defense.
[03:26:02.700 --> 03:26:05.700]  It's just about what's happening in the media Anthony and I'm going to throw the baton to you.
[03:26:05.700 --> 03:26:06.700]  Absolutely.
[03:26:06.700 --> 03:26:10.700]  Well, living defense is for me, it's a bestseller because you don't actually,
[03:26:10.700 --> 03:26:13.700]  and I hate to say this, you don't have to do anything.
[03:26:13.700 --> 03:26:16.700]  So you just take it in the morning, you take it in the morning, you take it at night.
[03:26:16.700 --> 03:26:18.700]  It's not like you have to go through a cleanse protocol.
[03:26:18.700 --> 03:26:20.700]  You take a lot of stuff rough.
[03:26:20.700 --> 03:26:21.700]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:26:21.700 --> 03:26:23.700]  So some of it, I mean, hey, I love the liver shield.
[03:26:23.700 --> 03:26:25.700]  I love the liver cleanse, the advanced liver cleanse.
[03:26:25.700 --> 03:26:26.700]  It works.
[03:26:26.700 --> 03:26:27.700]  The real deal.
[03:26:27.700 --> 03:26:28.700]  It has tons of five star reviews.
[03:26:28.700 --> 03:26:29.700]  It's good.
[03:26:29.700 --> 03:26:30.700]  But you're starring in the movie alien.
[03:26:30.700 --> 03:26:34.700]  But you have to do some stuff and or you can take liver shield, just put it in your protein shake.
[03:26:34.700 --> 03:26:38.700]  But with living defense, again, I hate to say you literally don't have to do anything.
[03:26:38.700 --> 03:26:40.700]  You just take the capsules.
[03:26:40.700 --> 03:26:41.700]  That's it.
[03:26:41.700 --> 03:26:42.700]  Your cleanse is done.
[03:26:42.700 --> 03:26:45.700]  A lot of folks do report that a week though it does cause a flush.
[03:26:45.700 --> 03:26:47.700]  Well, you know, it depends on what you got in your body.
[03:26:47.700 --> 03:26:53.700]  It has the enzymes in there which can break down the shield so called of these harmful organisms in your body.
[03:26:53.700 --> 03:26:54.700]  And I don't know about you.
[03:26:54.700 --> 03:26:56.700]  Why are you being racist against tapeworms?
[03:26:56.700 --> 03:26:57.700]  I'm being racist against tapeworms.
[03:26:57.700 --> 03:26:58.700]  And I like sushi a lot.
[03:26:58.700 --> 03:26:59.700]  I really, really like sushi.
[03:26:59.700 --> 03:27:03.700]  And you know how many harmful organisms are in a piece of sushi?
[03:27:03.700 --> 03:27:04.700]  Oh my gosh.
[03:27:04.700 --> 03:27:05.700]  Oh my gosh.
[03:27:05.700 --> 03:27:06.700]  Oh my gosh.
[03:27:06.700 --> 03:27:09.700]  I used to see these videos where they pour coke on like pork and worms.
[03:27:09.700 --> 03:27:10.700]  Come on.
[03:27:10.700 --> 03:27:11.700]  I didn't believe it.
[03:27:11.700 --> 03:27:12.700]  Yeah.
[03:27:12.700 --> 03:27:14.700]  A few months ago, I don't eat a lot of pork just because it's for me.
[03:27:14.700 --> 03:27:18.700]  And the point is, cause I always just hear stuff about it.
[03:27:18.700 --> 03:27:19.700]  I like bacon though.
[03:27:19.700 --> 03:27:22.700]  And I was sitting there and there was fricking worms in it.
[03:27:22.700 --> 03:27:24.700]  And I meant to videotape it, but it was so gross.
[03:27:24.700 --> 03:27:25.700]  I didn't do it.
[03:27:25.700 --> 03:27:26.700]  It's going to be a viral video.
[03:27:26.700 --> 03:27:27.700]  You know what's sad though?
[03:27:27.700 --> 03:27:30.700]  The worms that you don't see are still on there.
[03:27:30.700 --> 03:27:31.700]  Yeah, the edge.
[03:27:31.700 --> 03:27:34.700]  Especially when you go to a sushi place and let's say it's not the best sushi place.
[03:27:34.700 --> 03:27:38.700]  They get the filler fish and they let it sit there and they just put it and wrap it in the rice.
[03:27:38.700 --> 03:27:40.700]  You realize that's raw fish.
[03:27:40.700 --> 03:27:41.700]  Nothing has been done to it.
[03:27:41.700 --> 03:27:43.700]  Nothing has been done to even sear it and kill anything in there.
[03:27:43.700 --> 03:27:44.700]  There's a lot of...
[03:27:44.700 --> 03:27:48.700]  That's why they say a lot of models don't just eat sushi to lose weight because it's low-calorie.
[03:27:48.700 --> 03:27:49.700]  They want to get the worms.
[03:27:49.700 --> 03:27:54.700]  Some people want the tapeworms so that it sucks the nutrients, which is the silliest, most insane thing ever.
[03:27:54.700 --> 03:27:56.700]  It was popular in Japan for a while.
[03:27:56.700 --> 03:27:58.700]  I think Hillary Clinton is a giant tapeworm.
[03:27:58.700 --> 03:28:02.700]  I think she's stealing our nutrients and we need to live and defense her out of the country.
[03:28:02.700 --> 03:28:03.700]  I'm going to say this.
[03:28:03.700 --> 03:28:09.700]  Not only does Michelle Obama is a tranny, I believe Hillary Clinton is a giant intergalactic tapeworm
[03:28:09.700 --> 03:28:13.700]  that traveled here via the ninth dimension and is actually wearing a rubber mask.
[03:28:13.700 --> 03:28:18.700]  In fact, let's play the video for TV viewers just if we're up there on stage when she puts the rubber mask on and turns into the Joker.
[03:28:18.700 --> 03:28:21.700]  Why do you think the giant worm chose the Joker mask?
[03:28:21.700 --> 03:28:23.700]  Well, you know, it's a certain look, right?
[03:28:23.700 --> 03:28:31.700]  I think as a giant intergalactic, multi-dimensional, ethereal tapeworm, she's going to want to look a certain way, you know?
[03:28:31.700 --> 03:28:34.700]  And if that is the case, which I'm sure it is.
[03:28:34.700 --> 03:28:38.700]  I'm sure there's researchers have concluded that she is in fact a tapeworm.
[03:28:38.700 --> 03:28:45.700]  Well, I heard she also carries all those cat worms that are in the brain and she just foments them into the school lunch program food.
[03:28:45.700 --> 03:28:48.700]  The cat worms, you know, nobody believes the cat worms.
[03:28:48.700 --> 03:28:49.700]  Nobody believes a lot of the stuff.
[03:28:49.700 --> 03:28:51.700]  Scientists are growing organs and pigs.
[03:28:51.700 --> 03:28:52.700]  Some of us are being serious.
[03:28:52.700 --> 03:28:58.700]  No one believes that there's that worm that gets in the snail that makes it go to the top of the tree to be eaten by birds
[03:28:58.700 --> 03:29:04.700]  to then put its spores back out for more snails and actually gets into the brain and remote controls the snail.
[03:29:04.700 --> 03:29:13.700]  And on a serious note too, no, that is real, obviously, there is a lot of theories that the parasites that we're eating every single day that we can't do anything about that are just going in us.
[03:29:13.700 --> 03:29:17.700]  A lot of those parasites could be behind disease in a number of ways.
[03:29:17.700 --> 03:29:18.700]  Like it could be, it could be.
[03:29:18.700 --> 03:29:24.700]  And folks, I mean, for casting about her being a tapeworm, now Michelle Obama does have a tapeworm in her pants.
[03:29:24.700 --> 03:29:32.700]  But I mean, serious about the worms that go in and take over the brain of the snail and the cats carry a worm that gets into your brain and makes you enjoy the smell of cat peas.
[03:29:32.700 --> 03:29:34.700]  You have more of the cats around.
[03:29:34.700 --> 03:29:35.700]  That is actually real.
[03:29:35.700 --> 03:29:36.700]  In fact, Anthony, pull those up during the break.
[03:29:36.700 --> 03:29:37.700]  People think I'm making this up.
[03:29:37.700 --> 03:29:40.700]  I shouldn't make satire and make some of the real stuff, but I'm going to say it.
[03:29:40.700 --> 03:29:41.700]  She's not a tapeworm.
[03:29:41.700 --> 03:29:44.700]  She's actually a brainworm from a cat.
[03:29:44.700 --> 03:30:10.700]  Okay, we'll be back soon.
[03:30:15.700 --> 03:30:20.700]  He calls him a dangerous class of people who've been harmed by globalism.
[03:30:20.700 --> 03:30:26.700]  According to his book, which is one of only 10 subjects to be covered at Bilderberg, he breaks down society into several classes.
[03:30:26.700 --> 03:30:31.700]  Under the small number of super rich elite who are meeting at Bilderberg are the Salateria.
[03:30:31.700 --> 03:30:33.700]  Then there's the professional technicians.
[03:30:33.700 --> 03:30:35.700]  He calls proficient.
[03:30:35.700 --> 03:30:40.700]  Then we come to the dangerous ones, the Precariat, who work menial, low paying jobs.
[03:30:40.700 --> 03:30:47.700]  So how do the elite propose to control the Precariat that he says are an incipient political monster?
[03:30:47.700 --> 03:30:54.700]  Well, he proposes giving every legal resident of a country money without a job to create a permanent dependent class.
[03:30:54.700 --> 03:30:56.700]  What H.G. Wells called the Eloi.

[03:33:25.700 --> 03:33:29.700]  He wants to get to this big drudge piece, and then we're running out of time here.
[03:33:29.700 --> 03:33:33.700]  Maybe we should air it in the Fourth Hour tomorrow, but I'll let Anthony take over.
[03:33:33.700 --> 03:33:38.700]  But I briefly wanted to mention something because I heard David Knight talking about it, and I meant to cover it the last few days.
[03:33:38.700 --> 03:33:46.700]  You have the precariet, and that's a merger of precarious with the proletariat, meaning the general slave population.
[03:33:46.700 --> 03:33:50.700]  In sociology and economics, the precariet is a social class.
[03:33:50.700 --> 03:33:59.700]  Well, they have this political scientist who's written a book about it, and it's one of the 10 topics they admit they're covering in their press release of the group that didn't exist until a few years ago, because we were crazy.
[03:33:59.700 --> 03:34:09.700]  The world's most elite conference this year will discuss something called the precariet, and they go on to say, yeah, we've gotten rid of the middle class, and so there's these giant masses of young people with no future.
[03:34:09.700 --> 03:34:15.700]  We need to all give them money, just random money, but have state controls over them to control them.
[03:34:15.700 --> 03:34:18.700]  But I've always told you the plan is to make you dependent.
[03:34:18.700 --> 03:34:25.700]  The Bilderberg group is openly admitting and mainlining, and you see European countries calling for this, this check you get.
[03:34:25.700 --> 03:34:29.700]  You got to take vaccines, got to do what they say about how many kids you can have.
[03:34:29.700 --> 03:34:32.700]  We're always told there's two people on welfare having 10 kids.
[03:34:32.700 --> 03:34:39.700]  Yeah, they set it up like that to then have the cultural backlash, have a big, giant, uneducated, massive people of all races, colleges, and creeds.
[03:34:39.700 --> 03:34:45.700]  Rioting of their EBT card doesn't work in a few days, already happening.
[03:34:45.700 --> 03:34:50.700]  You can show the poor woman stomping around the grocery store after your EBT card doesn't work.
[03:34:50.700 --> 03:34:51.700]  EBT cards are now failing.
[03:34:51.700 --> 03:35:06.700]  It's a time bomb to then control the producers, and then there'll just be a move towards phasing out the lower class, and then it'll be phased everybody out as they get the robots in place where they'll produce everything for us, but then we'll have to socially go along with whatever the controllers tell us we must do.
[03:35:06.700 --> 03:35:12.700]  And David Knight did a great job breaking that down in a 60-second piece that aired because we've gotten rid of a lot of the commercials here.
[03:35:12.700 --> 03:35:16.700]  Commercials have been obsolete on radio and TV to a certain extent for about 10 years.
[03:35:16.700 --> 03:35:22.700]  If you don't produce just incredibly amazing commercials, they don't give you an effect.
[03:35:22.700 --> 03:35:28.700]  If you've got all great commercials on radio or TV, yes, and make a tournament of big deal like Super Bowl, then they're successful.
[03:35:28.700 --> 03:35:31.700]  That's why you see radio and TV and everywhere.
[03:35:31.700 --> 03:35:32.700]  It's product placement within the show.
[03:35:32.700 --> 03:35:36.700]  Most of it's hidden. We plug a few times an hour max, and it's all out in the open.
[03:35:36.700 --> 03:35:38.700]  Hey, we're selling you something we believe and we use.
[03:35:38.700 --> 03:35:44.700]  But I'm just digressing that we bring vignettes to the radio feeds and the video feeds.
[03:35:44.700 --> 03:35:46.700]  A lot of our stuff isn't even commercials.
[03:35:46.700 --> 03:35:53.700]  It's just promoting freedom because the currency we're looking for is human survival and not deciding it's the end of humanity.
[03:35:53.700 --> 03:35:54.700]  Not deciding we don't matter.
[03:35:54.700 --> 03:35:56.700]  Not deciding we're going to be phased out.
[03:35:56.700 --> 03:36:01.700]  And then I supposedly join the elite and go along with this and lose my soul.
[03:36:01.700 --> 03:36:05.700]  You build a system of dehumanization, it will suck everyone in.
[03:36:05.700 --> 03:36:06.700]  No one will escape.
[03:36:06.700 --> 03:36:08.700]  Turn back now.
[03:36:08.700 --> 03:36:11.700]  Warned the sentry at the four-way stop.
[03:36:11.700 --> 03:36:14.700]  This way lies hell.
[03:36:14.700 --> 03:36:18.700]  This way lies honor and the dark tower.
[03:36:18.700 --> 03:36:20.700]  Roland.
[03:36:20.700 --> 03:36:23.700]  Child Roland, the dark tower came.
[03:36:23.700 --> 03:36:26.700]  Read that poem and know it.
[03:36:26.700 --> 03:36:30.700]  Or be the dead rotting horse in the moat.
[03:36:30.700 --> 03:36:32.700]  All right, let's just go back to Anthony.
[03:36:32.700 --> 03:36:36.700]  Anthony, I'm going to turn this over to you and let you on show and run the rest of the transmission.
[03:36:36.700 --> 03:36:39.700]  Appreciate you coming in to host the fourth hour to twist Anthony's arm to do this.
[03:36:39.700 --> 03:36:41.700]  And I take over anyways.
[03:36:41.700 --> 03:36:42.700]  But just great job, my friend.
[03:36:42.700 --> 03:36:43.700]  Please continue.
[03:36:43.700 --> 03:36:44.700]  Hey, thank you.
[03:36:44.700 --> 03:36:48.700]  And by the way, the name of the cat parasite, I couldn't remember it.
[03:36:48.700 --> 03:36:50.700]  It's toxoplasmosis.
[03:36:50.700 --> 03:36:55.700]  And what happens is basically your cats go outside and they get infected by this parasite.
[03:36:55.700 --> 03:36:57.700]  They're bringing in and it goes into your brain.
[03:36:57.700 --> 03:36:58.700]  It's been linked to schizophrenia.
[03:36:58.700 --> 03:37:05.700]  That's why they may have called it the crazy cat woman back in the day because the woman with the 20 cats or whatever,
[03:37:05.700 --> 03:37:08.700]  they would have a massive amount of toxoplasmosis.
[03:37:08.700 --> 03:37:11.700]  And the Atlantic says how your cat is making you crazy.
[03:37:11.700 --> 03:37:12.700]  Scientific American.
[03:37:12.700 --> 03:37:14.700]  Massive suicide increases.
[03:37:14.700 --> 03:37:16.700]  Yeah, toxoplasmosis.
[03:37:16.700 --> 03:37:21.700]  And we talk to women we know who have cats and they literally laugh at us and will not listen.
[03:37:21.700 --> 03:37:22.700]  They say we're insane.
[03:37:22.700 --> 03:37:24.700]  And I've said it time and time again.
[03:37:24.700 --> 03:37:28.700]  You hear the thing, crazy cat lady where they love the cats everywhere and the pee everywhere.
[03:37:28.700 --> 03:37:33.700]  It programs you to love the smell of the pee with the toxins in it of the brainworm.
[03:37:33.700 --> 03:37:34.700]  It's literally science fiction.
[03:37:34.700 --> 03:37:35.700]  Yes.
[03:37:35.700 --> 03:37:36.700]  It sounds.
[03:37:36.700 --> 03:37:38.700]  Pull up the snail that's mind controlled by a worm too.
[03:37:38.700 --> 03:37:40.700]  That's on Discovery Channel.
[03:37:40.700 --> 03:37:41.700]  It all sounds crazy.
[03:37:41.700 --> 03:37:42.700]  And guess what?
[03:37:42.700 --> 03:37:43.700]  It is crazy.
[03:37:43.700 --> 03:37:44.700]  The life is crazy.
[03:37:44.700 --> 03:37:45.700]  The world's insane.
[03:37:45.700 --> 03:37:46.700]  A meteor could hit us right now.
[03:37:46.700 --> 03:37:47.700]  We could die.
[03:37:47.700 --> 03:37:48.700]  We could be in a car accident.
[03:37:48.700 --> 03:37:49.700]  Something could blow up.
[03:37:49.700 --> 03:37:50.700]  A nuclear explosion could happen.
[03:37:50.700 --> 03:37:51.700]  The world's insane.
[03:37:51.700 --> 03:37:53.700]  The point is we're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:37:53.700 --> 03:37:56.700]  We're in other interdimensional succubus parasites.
[03:37:56.700 --> 03:37:59.700]  The Bible and every culture say that are feeding on us as well.
[03:37:59.700 --> 03:38:00.700]  Who knows?
[03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:02.700]  All I know is completely run by it.
[03:38:02.700 --> 03:38:03.700]  There you go.
[03:38:03.700 --> 03:38:05.700]  Well, she is one big worm.
[03:38:05.700 --> 03:38:11.700]  But no, I mean, she's run by a seventh dimensional buck with a goblin named pink belly.
[03:38:11.700 --> 03:38:14.700]  Evidence is clear.
[03:38:14.700 --> 03:38:16.700]  The media matters of America.
[03:38:16.700 --> 03:38:17.700]  Yes.
[03:38:17.700 --> 03:38:21.700]  My shot of Hillary Clinton with her with her makeup off here.
[03:38:21.700 --> 03:38:23.700]  Let's show folks this.
[03:38:23.700 --> 03:38:25.700]  World's deadliest zombie snail.
[03:38:25.700 --> 03:38:27.700]  See, that's a National Geographic.
[03:38:27.700 --> 03:38:29.700]  Zombie snails.
[03:38:29.700 --> 03:38:32.700]  That's the general public are like zombie snails.
[03:38:32.700 --> 03:38:33.700]  They're the deadliest.
[03:38:33.700 --> 03:38:35.700]  Is it incredible though?
[03:38:35.700 --> 03:38:39.700]  As you said, incredible, incredible, incredible.
[03:38:39.700 --> 03:38:42.700]  That we're like making up words here and engaging in monics and things.
[03:38:42.700 --> 03:38:43.700]  You can go ahead and take over.
[03:38:43.700 --> 03:38:44.700]  I'll tell you what.
[03:38:44.700 --> 03:38:45.700]  I don't like to hate on the general public.
[03:38:45.700 --> 03:38:47.700]  I think we've turned into a headline society.
[03:38:47.700 --> 03:38:49.700]  I think they've been conditioned.
[03:38:49.700 --> 03:38:50.700]  We've all been conditioned.
[03:38:50.700 --> 03:38:51.700]  I've been conditioned.
[03:38:51.700 --> 03:38:55.700]  I'm not above anything to look at headlines and to not realize the details.
[03:38:55.700 --> 03:38:57.700]  And that's why we are going to be destroyed if we don't listen.
[03:38:57.700 --> 03:38:59.700]  All right, I'm going to leave, but they found it.
[03:38:59.700 --> 03:39:02.700]  It's Dr. Emilio Lazardo from the movie Bucca Rubanzai.
[03:39:02.700 --> 03:39:06.700]  So can we play the theme of Bucca Rubanzai one more time as they cue this up?
[03:39:06.700 --> 03:39:11.700]  John Harmon, can you find that again?
[03:39:11.700 --> 03:39:14.700]  Just let me know when you have it.
[03:39:14.700 --> 03:39:16.700]  This is why I quit doing the fourth hour.
[03:39:16.700 --> 03:39:20.700]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation after that.
[03:39:20.700 --> 03:39:22.700]  I'm against June's on the GCN.
[03:39:22.700 --> 03:39:24.700]  Turn to my radio network.
[03:39:24.700 --> 03:39:25.700]  To the big goofball.
[03:39:25.700 --> 03:39:26.700]  Yeah.
[03:39:26.700 --> 03:39:31.700]  Who would be crazy enough to actually take on the new world order and win?
[03:39:31.700 --> 03:39:38.700]  Now, as this is rolling together, mix the two, let's show people a clip of Emilio Lazardo.
[03:39:38.700 --> 03:39:39.700]  There you go.
[03:39:39.700 --> 03:39:40.700]  Turn up the audio on that place.
[03:39:40.700 --> 03:39:47.700]  Come on.
[03:39:47.700 --> 03:39:50.700]  Can you guys pull up Emilio Lazardo Bucca Rubanzai?
[03:39:50.700 --> 03:39:54.700]  I know that clip will be one of the first ones on YouTube and then show that.
[03:39:54.700 --> 03:39:55.700]  I was hair all sticking out.
[03:39:55.700 --> 03:39:57.700]  He's like, they're overthrusted.
[03:39:57.700 --> 03:39:59.700]  I mean, that's what these Democrat supporters are like.
[03:39:59.700 --> 03:40:00.700]  It's like they've been possessed.
[03:40:00.700 --> 03:40:02.700]  Did you see all the interviews when he ended?
[03:40:02.700 --> 03:40:08.700]  She couldn't find any Democrat supporters that weren't deranged loons.
[03:40:08.700 --> 03:40:14.700]  I think we should show the snails too.
[03:40:14.700 --> 03:40:15.700]  Did we find it?
[03:40:15.700 --> 03:40:16.700]  Here, can we please?
[03:40:16.700 --> 03:40:20.700]  Can we please find Emilio Lazardo or Bucca Rubanzai?
[03:40:20.700 --> 03:40:21.700]  This is key stuff.
[03:40:21.700 --> 03:40:24.700]  Actually, it's good because, you know, you talk about serious stuff all day.
[03:40:24.700 --> 03:40:26.700]  This is fun to do this every night.
[03:40:26.700 --> 03:40:28.700]  Of course, so you, Bucca Rubanzai.
[03:40:28.700 --> 03:40:29.700]  All right, it's yours.
[03:40:29.700 --> 03:40:30.700]  I'm leaving.
[03:40:30.700 --> 03:40:31.700]  I have a lot of work to do.
[03:40:31.700 --> 03:40:35.700]  Hey, you always, you always, we always come here and have fun and talk about this stuff.
[03:40:35.700 --> 03:40:36.700]  And you say, all right, I'm leaving.
[03:40:36.700 --> 03:40:37.700]  Now you get serious.
[03:40:37.700 --> 03:40:38.700]  Now you talk about.
[03:40:38.700 --> 03:40:39.700]  Oh, there's Lazardo right there.
[03:40:39.700 --> 03:40:40.700]  Back it up.
[03:40:40.700 --> 03:40:41.700]  Let's see him.
[03:40:41.700 --> 03:40:44.700]  I did that just from memory and it was funny, but we picked up on it.
[03:40:44.700 --> 03:40:45.700]  Here we go.
[03:40:45.700 --> 03:40:49.700]  Let's turn up the audio on this.
[03:40:49.700 --> 03:40:53.700]  Oh, there's no audio.
[03:40:53.700 --> 03:40:54.700]  Okay.
[03:40:54.700 --> 03:40:57.700]  All right, that's it.
[03:40:57.700 --> 03:40:59.700]  Lazardo's left the building and so by Anthony.
[03:40:59.700 --> 03:41:00.700]  Go ahead.
[03:41:00.700 --> 03:41:02.700]  I'll tell you what I'm going to do.
[03:41:02.700 --> 03:41:06.700]  Got news here I want to cover, including this craziness.
[03:41:06.700 --> 03:41:09.700]  Scientists growing human organs inside pigs to create chimeras.
[03:41:09.700 --> 03:41:10.700]  But guess what?
[03:41:10.700 --> 03:41:13.700]  They've been making chimeras for a long, long time.
[03:41:13.700 --> 03:41:14.700]  Got stories about that.
[03:41:14.700 --> 03:41:18.700]  And back in the day when we used to talk about it, I would talk about it.
[03:41:18.700 --> 03:41:21.700]  I heard Alex talking about it a long, long time ago.
[03:41:21.700 --> 03:41:22.700]  Oh, that's craziness.
[03:41:22.700 --> 03:41:23.700]  You're crazy.
[03:41:23.700 --> 03:41:28.700]  Chinese cows making human breast milk from six, seven years ago.
[03:41:28.700 --> 03:41:33.700]  The human animal chimeras were already unlocked and discovered in the UK.
[03:41:33.700 --> 03:41:34.700]  It's all craziness.
[03:41:34.700 --> 03:41:35.700]  But guess what?
[03:41:35.700 --> 03:41:38.700]  As I said, like we were talking about earlier, the world is crazy.
[03:41:38.700 --> 03:41:42.700]  We've got more about Oklahoma police seizing your bank account and how they can do that.
[03:41:42.700 --> 03:41:45.700]  Towns banning front yard gardens.
[03:41:45.700 --> 03:41:48.700]  Venezuela middle class dumpster diving for food.
[03:41:48.700 --> 03:41:50.700]  We're going to talk about a lot of that.
[03:41:50.700 --> 03:41:53.700]  But first, what I wanted to do and it's pressing, we're going to have to cut off the end of it.
[03:41:53.700 --> 03:41:55.700]  And you can see the rest on the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[03:41:55.700 --> 03:42:01.700]  As I wanted to play this full Drudge video because we played the two minute version of the Drudge warning before.
[03:42:01.700 --> 03:42:07.700]  Yesterday, we played it a little bit today and yesterday, but this video really summarizes all of it.
[03:42:07.700 --> 03:42:12.700]  When Matt Drudge came and came on Alex's show, he really hit a lot of key points.
[03:42:12.700 --> 03:42:16.700]  So if we have that ready, I know it's a lot of craziness going on back there in the production area.
[03:42:16.700 --> 03:42:21.700]  I would like to play Matt Drudge's warning to America.
[03:42:21.700 --> 03:42:31.700]  It's been more than 16 years since Matt Drudge gave his historic speech at the National Press Club on June 2, 1998.
[03:42:31.700 --> 03:42:34.700]  At that time, he said that the mainstream media would go bankrupt.
[03:42:34.700 --> 03:42:41.700]  That individual bloggers and researchers on the Internet were just as important as the New York Times.
[03:42:41.700 --> 03:42:47.700]  The controlled state-run media had a field day making fun of Matt Drudge.
[03:42:47.700 --> 03:42:54.700]  But today, their hubris has drained away and they're no longer as arrogant as they once were.
[03:42:54.700 --> 03:42:59.700]  Now we see calls for the FCC to regulate print news and online news.
[03:42:59.700 --> 03:43:05.700]  And we see establishment publications like Time Magazine, Newsweek, and the New York Times
[03:43:05.700 --> 03:43:10.700]  battling to keep from going completely bankrupt and imploding.
[03:43:10.700 --> 03:43:17.700]  It turns out pretty much everything that Matt Drudge said in that 40-minute speech has now come true.
[03:43:17.700 --> 03:43:23.700]  Well, Matt Drudge is saying a lot of things today that the mainstream media is still laughing at.
[03:43:23.700 --> 03:43:27.700]  Why do they laugh at people that have been proven right over and over again?
[03:43:27.700 --> 03:43:32.700]  Here are some of the most important moments, in my view, from Drudge's speech.
[03:43:32.700 --> 03:43:39.700]  And we're also adding headlines from over the years to show just how much of what he had to say came true.
[03:43:39.700 --> 03:43:42.700]  This is something new.
[03:43:42.700 --> 03:43:52.700]  This marks the first time that an individual has access to the news wires outside of a newsroom.
[03:43:52.700 --> 03:44:03.700]  You get to read all the news from the Associated Press, UPI Reuters, to the Moral Cane Agency French Press, and the Chinois.
[03:44:03.700 --> 03:44:13.700]  I'm a personal friend of the Chinois Press, and Time was only newsrooms had access to the full pictures of the day's events.
[03:44:13.700 --> 03:44:17.700]  But now any citizen does.
[03:44:17.700 --> 03:44:23.700]  We get to see the kinds of cuts that are made for all kinds of reasons.
[03:44:23.700 --> 03:44:31.700]  Endless layers of editors with endless agendas changing bits and pieces so by the time the newspaper hits your welcome mat,
[03:44:31.700 --> 03:44:34.700]  it had no meaning.
[03:44:34.700 --> 03:44:39.700]  Now with a modem, anyone can follow the world and report on the world.
[03:44:39.700 --> 03:44:43.700]  No middleman, no big brother.
[03:44:43.700 --> 03:44:46.700]  And I guess this changes everything.
[03:44:46.700 --> 03:44:55.700]  More than ten years after breaking the Clinton-Lewinsky story, Matt Drudge remains more powerful than ever with his website, TheDredgerReport.com.
[03:44:55.700 --> 03:45:01.700]  Drudge is a legend on the Internet. Every journalist and politician in America reads his website on a daily basis.
[03:45:01.700 --> 03:45:07.700]  When radio lost out to television, there was anxiety.
[03:45:07.700 --> 03:45:17.700]  The people in the radio business were absolutely anxious and demanded government stop the upcoming television wave.
[03:45:17.700 --> 03:45:25.700]  Television was very nervous about other mediums coming forward, cable.
[03:45:25.700 --> 03:45:32.700]  The movies didn't want sitcoms to be taped at movie studios, for fear it would take away from the movies.
[03:45:32.700 --> 03:45:41.700]  No, television saved the movies. The Internet is going to save the news business.
[03:45:41.700 --> 03:45:50.700]  I envision a future where there will be 300 million reporters or anyone from anywhere can report for any reason.
[03:45:50.700 --> 03:45:54.700]  Its freedom of participation absolutely realized.
[03:45:54.700 --> 03:46:10.700]  The First Lady of the United States recently addressed concerns about Internet during a cyberspatial millennium project press conference just weeks after Lewinsky broke.
[03:46:10.700 --> 03:46:15.700]  And we're all going to have to rethink how we deal with the Internet.
[03:46:15.700 --> 03:46:25.700]  As exciting as these new developments are, there are a number of serious issues without any kind of editing function or gatekeeping function.
[03:46:25.700 --> 03:46:29.700]  I wonder who she was referring to.
[03:46:29.700 --> 03:46:46.700]  When Brooklyn continued, any time an individual leaps so far ahead of that balance and throws a system, whatever it might be, political, economic, technological, out of balance, you've got a problem.
[03:46:46.700 --> 03:46:52.700]  It can lead to all kinds of bad outcomes which we have seen historically.
[03:46:52.700 --> 03:46:57.700]  We are in an information war and we are losing that war.
[03:46:57.700 --> 03:47:05.700]  Would she have said the same thing about Ben Franklin or Thomas Edison or Henry Ford or Einstein?
[03:47:05.700 --> 03:47:11.700]  They all leapt so far ahead out that they shook the balance?
[03:47:11.700 --> 03:47:15.700]  No, I say to these people, faster, not slower.
[03:47:15.700 --> 03:47:19.700]  Create, let your mind flow, let the imagination take over.
[03:47:19.700 --> 03:47:30.700]  And if technology has finally caught up with individual liberty, why would anyone who loves freedom want to rethink that?
[03:47:30.700 --> 03:47:38.700]  If you're an undersecretary at the energy department and you're doing an interview and you say one thing, during you could end up being on the front page of Drudge,
[03:47:38.700 --> 03:47:49.700]  anyone saying anything can get caught up in the spin cycle in a way that is very damaging.
[03:47:49.700 --> 03:47:53.700]  It hurts what we're trying to do at the other base but also is very damaging to that individual person.
[03:47:53.700 --> 03:47:56.700]  We cannot hide our bad news stories.
[03:47:56.700 --> 03:48:02.700]  Bad news gets out one way or the other and we must come to terms with telling the bad stories as well as the good.
[03:48:02.700 --> 03:48:08.700]  When bad things happen, the American people should hear from us, not as a scoop on the Drudge Report.
[03:48:08.700 --> 03:48:16.700]  The editor of Civilization Magazine, Adam Goodheart, wrote a great op-ed in The New York Times talking about,
[03:48:16.700 --> 03:48:28.700]  is this really something new, this type of fast reporting, this competitive, very competitive part of the headline generation?
[03:48:28.700 --> 03:48:36.700]  He maintains it was a going back to our foundations when the press was found in quite a different atmosphere,
[03:48:36.700 --> 03:48:44.700]  when the press would report that the president's mother was a common prostitute brought over by the British Army.
[03:48:44.700 --> 03:48:48.700]  Imagine if someone did that now.
[03:48:48.700 --> 03:48:55.700]  We have a great tradition of freedom of the press in this country, unpopular press.
[03:48:55.700 --> 03:49:01.700]  If the First Lady is concerned about this internet cycle, what would she have done during the heyday
[03:49:01.700 --> 03:49:05.700]  when there was 12, 13 editions of a paper in one day?
[03:49:05.700 --> 03:49:07.700]  What would she have done with that news cycle?
[03:49:07.700 --> 03:49:12.700]  That's the foundation. That's what makes this club great, is the tradition.
[03:49:12.700 --> 03:49:21.700]  And I think we have a tradition of provocative press and that I maintain that I'm the new face on that.
[03:49:21.700 --> 03:49:25.700]  I'll take that for a season, but a lot of the stuff I do is serious stuff.
[03:49:25.700 --> 03:49:31.700]  I was first to report that the encryption was missing from a morale satellite, for example, a couple of weeks ago.
[03:49:31.700 --> 03:49:37.700]  I didn't see the main press reporting that one, so not everything I do is gossip or bedroom.
[03:49:37.700 --> 03:49:44.700]  To the contrary, I think that's just an easy label to dismiss me and to dismiss the new medium.
[03:49:44.700 --> 03:49:53.700]  But I'm excited about the launch of this internet medium and I get freedom of the press belongs to anyone who owns one.
[03:50:14.700 --> 03:50:23.700]  Any day you can find headlines about vaccines, mass fluoridation and the 9-11 cover-up into the so-called mainstream GOP establishment.
[03:50:23.700 --> 03:50:27.700]  Alex Jones was a champion of Clive and Bundy from the very beginning.
[03:50:27.700 --> 03:50:34.700]  Because he's saying he'll do whatever he has to not have his grazing rights stolen by these pirates.
[03:50:34.700 --> 03:50:39.700]  Drudge elevated the story and it made its way onto Fox News' Airways.
[03:50:39.700 --> 03:50:45.700]  Next thing you know, so-called mainstream Republicans are calling people like this, patriots.
[03:50:45.700 --> 03:50:53.700]  The conservative website that's called The Drudge Report pulled out all the stops today to promote a big new bombshell video.
[03:50:53.700 --> 03:51:00.700]  Today, the leading conservative website's headline was this. Civil War Senate to go for handguns.
[03:51:00.700 --> 03:51:05.700]  I'm an addict. I'm a drudge addict. My home page is actually something else, National Review,
[03:51:05.700 --> 03:51:12.700]  but I find myself going to drudge all the time because as a communications professional, you can tell what's going to come down the pike.
[03:51:12.700 --> 03:51:17.700]  If there's a siren on Drudge Report, like, oh boy, better go knock on the Oval Office door and let them know what's going to happen.
[03:51:17.700 --> 03:51:24.700]  Walkergate. Yes, we're calling it that. It's the latest Hillary conspiracy theory that set the internet ablaze after The Drudge Report
[03:51:24.700 --> 03:51:30.700]  questioned whether Clinton was using a walker in this People Magazine cover photo.
[03:51:30.700 --> 03:51:38.700]  Well, Internet pioneer Matt Drudge created a firestorm over the weekend tweeting, just paid the Obamacare penalty for not getting covered.
[03:51:38.700 --> 03:51:40.700]  I'm calling it a liberty tax.
[03:51:40.700 --> 03:51:46.700]  But a White House representative firing back, tweeting, flat lie, no fee for previous years, scary how much influence he once had.
[03:51:46.700 --> 03:51:50.700]  And then the White House shot back and said, you know, made some cheap shot about, oh, he used to be relevant.
[03:51:50.700 --> 03:51:54.700]  Are you kidding me? Matt Drudge used to be relevant? Let me give you the numbers.
[03:51:54.700 --> 03:52:02.700]  In one month, go on the website, 800, almost 810 million unique views on The Drudge Report.
[03:52:02.700 --> 03:52:06.700]  I guess that a nice Twitter fight between the White House and Matt Drudge.
[03:52:06.700 --> 03:52:13.700]  People had suggested I start a mailing list. So I collected the emails and set up a list called The Drudge Report.
[03:52:13.700 --> 03:52:18.700]  One reader turned into five, then turned into a hundred.
[03:52:18.700 --> 03:52:26.700]  And faster than you could say, I never had sex with that woman. It was a thousand, five thousand, a hundred thousand people.
[03:52:26.700 --> 03:52:30.700]  The ensuing website practically launched itself.
[03:52:30.700 --> 03:52:35.700]  That is the video about what Matt Drudge said ultimately on coming true.
[03:52:35.700 --> 03:52:44.700]  And it's the most amazing thing when he was talking about, I foresee an age in which the Internet will allow there to be 300 million reporters.
[03:52:44.700 --> 03:52:49.700]  And it ties in to this idea I wanted to talk about today.
[03:52:49.700 --> 03:52:54.700]  And of course, there's so much news that we didn't get to cover. I'm going to try and cover some of it.
[03:52:54.700 --> 03:53:01.700]  But the idea that we live in what I call a standardized test society, because you see, you're only given options.
[03:53:01.700 --> 03:53:04.700]  Or you could also call it a A, B, C, or D society.
[03:53:04.700 --> 03:53:10.700]  What I mean by that is from childhood, we're put into the school system where we're given tests.
[03:53:10.700 --> 03:53:18.700]  And these tests are standardized. They grade us and our value and our worth and our intelligence based on A, B, C, or D.
[03:53:18.700 --> 03:53:21.700]  Sometimes you might be able to write in your own answer, right?
[03:53:21.700 --> 03:53:30.700]  But the big ones, the SATs, all these big grand tests, the standardized tests from the states, from the system, right?
[03:53:30.700 --> 03:53:32.700]  It's all A, B, C, or D.
[03:53:32.700 --> 03:53:38.700]  And we've been accustomed to this idea that we can either choose A, B, C, or D.
[03:53:38.700 --> 03:53:46.700]  We have to watch either Fox News, MSNBC, whatever you want to watch as long as it's mainstream media, right?
[03:53:46.700 --> 03:53:51.700]  A, B, C, or D. Sometimes there's not even a C or D. Sometimes it's A or B.
[03:53:51.700 --> 03:53:57.700]  You've been told your entire lives you have to subscribe to this system, the standardized test society,
[03:53:57.700 --> 03:54:01.700]  where you have no individual choice, where you can't do your own thing, right?
[03:54:01.700 --> 03:54:05.700]  Even when you graduate high school, they give you a test to determine your career.
[03:54:05.700 --> 03:54:09.700]  You're in your career based on this test and there's a list of careers that you're going to be.
[03:54:09.700 --> 03:54:11.700]  It's very 1984-esque.
[03:54:11.700 --> 03:54:14.700]  They say you would be best as a plumber.
[03:54:14.700 --> 03:54:20.700]  You wrote these multiple choice questions because we don't have the capacity to see people individually.
[03:54:20.700 --> 03:54:24.700]  You wrote these multiple choice questions and we determined that you would most likely be best as a plumber.
[03:54:24.700 --> 03:54:28.700]  Well, Matt George didn't see just A, B, C, or D.
[03:54:28.700 --> 03:54:32.700]  He saw the Internet, which a lot of the mainstream media type people hated,
[03:54:32.700 --> 03:54:38.700]  because it was access points for us, the individuals to do our thing, just like how I'm speaking to you right now,
[03:54:38.700 --> 03:54:44.700]  is through the Internet or through radio, which was enabled by Alex's presence on the Internet.
[03:54:44.700 --> 03:54:48.700]  And what happens is you start to lose control.
[03:54:48.700 --> 03:54:52.700]  The system starts to lose control and Drudge saw that.
[03:54:52.700 --> 03:54:57.700]  No matter even what you think about him or the Judge Report, maybe you even hate the politics of it.
[03:54:57.700 --> 03:55:01.700]  But guess what? He was a trailblazer and he was a mega-genius.
[03:55:01.700 --> 03:55:05.700]  And he is still a mega-genius in the sense that he saw all of this coming.
[03:55:05.700 --> 03:55:13.700]  He saw all of this happening and he saw it for what it was, an opportunity of expansion into the idea bank of the world.
[03:55:13.700 --> 03:55:16.700]  And instead of being someone that was sitting there saying,
[03:55:16.700 --> 03:55:22.700]  the Internet is bad and scary and evil and it is a terrible thing and we need to restrict control and the government needs to regulate it,
[03:55:22.700 --> 03:55:25.700]  he said this is a bounty of opportunity.
[03:55:25.700 --> 03:55:29.700]  And he said there will be attacks on the freedom of the Internet.
[03:55:29.700 --> 03:55:34.700]  And he came on to Alex's show. Alex's program has said such powerful things.
[03:55:34.700 --> 03:55:36.700]  I mean, really, really powerful.
[03:55:36.700 --> 03:55:39.700]  And speaking to the guy, he's a really amazing human being.
[03:55:39.700 --> 03:55:45.700]  But the very concept we now have these tools, these opportunities at our disposal,
[03:55:45.700 --> 03:55:50.700]  just this cell phone right here, this phone I'm holding in my hand, is opportunity.
[03:55:50.700 --> 03:55:52.700]  It is the ability to do anything.
[03:55:52.700 --> 03:55:57.700]  It is the ability to reach people through any venue online that you could have never dreamed of.
[03:55:57.700 --> 03:56:01.700]  It's more powerful than a supercomputer in the 1950s that cost $50 million.
[03:56:01.700 --> 03:56:04.700]  And you would just have it in your hand all day sitting there.
[03:56:04.700 --> 03:56:08.700]  You have the opportunity to actually do something with it that could change the world.
[03:56:08.700 --> 03:56:11.700]  You could actually take a video on your phone and change the planet.
[03:56:11.700 --> 03:56:13.700]  That is powerful stuff.
[03:56:13.700 --> 03:56:17.700]  And the people that saw that from the beginning were people like Matt Drudge.
[03:56:17.700 --> 03:56:21.700]  And you know, Alex thought too, he was the first to start streaming his program live on the Internet
[03:56:21.700 --> 03:56:26.700]  like you are now probably watching it at infowords.com forward slash show.
[03:56:26.700 --> 03:56:29.700]  So this is what it comes down to.
[03:56:29.700 --> 03:56:31.700]  These are the things that change the world.
[03:56:31.700 --> 03:56:35.700]  These are the things and the opportunities that we need to grasp and take a hold of.
[03:56:35.700 --> 03:56:40.700]  Now quickly before the program's over, and now it comes back tomorrow from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central,
[03:56:40.700 --> 03:56:43.700]  I just wanted to hit on just a few things here that are happening.
[03:56:43.700 --> 03:56:45.700]  So we talk about the details.
[03:56:45.700 --> 03:56:48.700]  We talk about toxoplasmosis, the cat parasite.
[03:56:48.700 --> 03:56:51.700]  Well now scientists are growing organs inside pigs to create chimeras.
[03:56:51.700 --> 03:56:57.700]  This is from the independent U.S. researchers have injected human stem cells into pig embryos
[03:56:57.700 --> 03:56:59.700]  to produce human pig embryos known as chimeras.
[03:56:59.700 --> 03:57:01.700]  Now this isn't new.
[03:57:01.700 --> 03:57:04.700]  Only got a minute here, but this isn't new news.
[03:57:04.700 --> 03:57:10.700]  In 2011 Sky News reported Chinese GM cows are already making human breast milk.
[03:57:10.700 --> 03:57:15.700]  And we've known for a long time that human animal chimeras are being made.
[03:57:15.700 --> 03:57:17.700]  They face new ethical scrutiny.
[03:57:17.700 --> 03:57:21.700]  This was from Stat News in 2015.
[03:57:21.700 --> 03:57:26.700]  And this piece from 2012 on 10 ways science is using human animal hybrids.
[03:57:26.700 --> 03:57:30.700]  There's tons of different so-called chimeras already in existence.
[03:57:30.700 --> 03:57:32.700]  Society is already being done.
[03:57:32.700 --> 03:57:34.700]  And here's the thing about this.
[03:57:34.700 --> 03:57:39.700]  We need to get involved in things that are actually detailed like this as a society
[03:57:39.700 --> 03:57:41.700]  instead of being a headline society.
[03:57:41.700 --> 03:57:42.700]  You heard about the drive-by society.
[03:57:42.700 --> 03:57:44.700]  How about a headline society?
[03:57:44.700 --> 03:57:49.700]  We just read headlines on the media, make assumptions, don't read past the first paragraph and leave.
[03:57:49.700 --> 03:57:54.700]  We're tired, we're exhausted, we've been worked to the bone, we've been attacked, right?
[03:57:54.700 --> 03:57:56.700]  We don't have time, but guess what?
[03:57:56.700 --> 03:57:59.700]  We've got to get engaged because as they start churning out human chimeras
[03:57:59.700 --> 03:58:03.700]  without the public even realizing it, we're not even involved.
[03:58:03.700 --> 03:58:08.700]  We're too busy as they pull over people on the side of the road in Oklahoma and take all their cash.
[03:58:08.700 --> 03:58:13.700]  We're not even involved because we're too busy caught up in the minutiae junk, the distraction.
[03:58:13.700 --> 03:58:16.700]  We have to get aligned and get on our.
[03:58:16.700 --> 03:58:20.700]  Anyway, I'm Anthony Giorgiardi and this has been the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:58:20.700 --> 03:58:22.700]  Alex, thank you for inviting me on.
[03:58:22.700 --> 03:58:24.700]  A lot of fun this hour and stay tuned tomorrow.
[03:58:24.700 --> 03:58:45.700]  Alex will be back 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central.
