[00:00.000 --> 00:13.620]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex
[00:13.620 --> 00:20.800]  Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:33.640]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome and thank you so much for joining us today
[00:33.640 --> 00:43.680]  we're going to be live here for the next four hours coming up we have
[00:43.680 --> 00:51.600]  climatologists Dr. Tim Ball who's been targeted and persecuted by the global
[00:51.600 --> 00:58.720]  government climate eugenics cult and we're going to get his take on the leaked
[00:58.720 --> 01:05.600]  emails and documents from the Chief Climate Research Center that the United
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.040]  Nations uses its main source where they admit that they were fraudulently
[01:10.040 --> 01:13.160]  altering the numbers to cover up the fact that the earth has actually been
[01:13.160 --> 01:19.960]  cooling since 1961 it was explosively heating part of a normal cycle a
[01:19.960 --> 01:31.720]  sub-cycle and it's now been slowly cooling slowly cooling so that is coming
[01:31.720 --> 01:38.840]  up later today Mark Marino is also going to be on with this he runs the climate
[01:38.840 --> 01:45.920]  depot one of the chief debunkers of the global warming myth that it's man-made
[01:45.920 --> 01:50.600]  he will also be joining us it's bad news but it's also good news in a way
[01:50.600 --> 01:55.000]  because it'll just build the suspense and maybe it'll give me time to have all
[01:55.000 --> 01:58.560]  three of the winners because we didn't have time to get second and third place
[01:58.560 --> 02:03.640]  contacted to maybe pop in only first place of course was part of the prize to
[02:03.640 --> 02:07.360]  be on with Charlie Sheen we've gotten a hold of him with the 20 minutes with the
[02:07.360 --> 02:12.560]  president but Charlie has never flaked out of me before but he called me this
[02:12.560 --> 02:16.280]  morning he said man I am really sick I'm going back to sleep left me a message
[02:16.280 --> 02:22.720]  at like five in the morning his time seven in the morning my time and I'm
[02:22.720 --> 02:26.080]  just not gonna count on him being better tomorrow and then we're of course
[02:26.080 --> 02:30.680]  off for Thanksgiving so Charlie will be on with the winners or winner depending
[02:30.680 --> 02:34.240]  if we have all three first place second and third place on he'll be on Sunday
[02:34.240 --> 02:38.440]  Monday or Tuesday I'm sure Charlie will be able to do one of those days and we've
[02:38.440 --> 02:41.640]  talked to the first place winner he's gonna be able to come on either one of
[02:41.640 --> 02:45.640]  those days so Charlie Sheen will be with us to talk about the latest 9-11
[02:45.640 --> 02:49.440]  revelations of course and 20 minutes of the president contest that turned out to
[02:49.440 --> 02:54.440]  be just a gigantic huge success so we'll give you all the details of the winners
[02:54.440 --> 03:00.320]  coming up but you know a lot of people have the flu and are sick and stuff
[03:00.320 --> 03:04.440]  Charlie didn't know what he has but he's sick in bed and didn't sound too good in
[03:04.440 --> 03:10.200]  the message so I'm not gonna and the poor guy sent me a text saying he might
[03:10.200 --> 03:14.240]  still drag out of bed but I'm not gonna call his wife on the home phone his
[03:14.240 --> 03:18.360]  cell phones off and have him drug out of bed to be propped up here on the radio
[03:18.360 --> 03:23.000]  with us I certainly know the feeling of being sick in bed so Charlie Sheen will
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.520]  be with us sometime next week but I do want to just go ahead and get this a
[03:27.520 --> 03:32.440]  contest over with and announced and I do want to play some of the top entries
[03:32.440 --> 03:37.600]  and so I may just go ahead and do it this Sunday I got a sneak and suspicion
[03:37.600 --> 03:41.040]  Charlie I want to do it Sunday or Monday but we'll certainly get this done
[03:41.040 --> 03:44.680]  very very very soon that Charlie in his message was saying let's do it tomorrow
[03:44.680 --> 03:48.880]  but you know what I'm not gonna sit here and say oh he'll be on tomorrow and
[03:48.880 --> 03:53.880]  then he might still be sick tomorrow so we're just gonna punt into Sunday or
[03:53.880 --> 04:02.240]  next week so that is done there and that also gives us time to cover all of the
[04:02.240 --> 04:08.280]  just amazing just amazingly important news that we have here in front of us
[04:08.280 --> 04:10.640]  today
[04:16.080 --> 04:20.080]  also Darrell Rundis in studio with us in the last hour today but I'm really
[04:20.080 --> 04:25.520]  looking forward to having the head of the climate depot former aide to senator
[04:25.520 --> 04:29.560]  Inhofe who has completely been validated and vindicated I mean five years ago
[04:29.560 --> 04:34.760]  when Inhofe did the research he's a smart cookie and came out and said that
[04:34.760 --> 04:41.680]  global warming was a hoax to tax people the the the global warming criminals
[04:41.680 --> 04:47.800]  were still lying and saying what tax that's a conspiracy theory and now in
[04:47.800 --> 04:52.480]  home is completely vindicated in spades so we're gonna break it all down today
[04:52.480 --> 04:59.280]  ladies and gentlemen and take your phone calls wide open phones at 1-800-259-9231

[05:15.080 --> 05:19.720]  need it most unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no
[05:19.720 --> 05:23.400]  fumes and produces electricity for free it's like having an electric power

[08:17.640 --> 08:22.840]  a new law gives parents the right to have leftover blood samples destroyed but a
[08:22.840 --> 08:27.480]  loophole is raising some privacy concerns KXA's Nancy Wilson is live with
[08:27.480 --> 08:32.360]  the story all knew it 10 well every year about 400,000 babies are born in Texas
[08:32.360 --> 08:35.920]  now before they're discharged from the hospital they leave something okay for
[08:35.920 --> 08:40.120]  the state you heard it right and I'm going to play this in full in just a
[08:40.120 --> 08:43.920]  moment that I'm going to go over all the top news headlines we're going to be
[08:43.920 --> 08:48.440]  breaking down today and also give you a list of the guests that are coming up a
[08:48.440 --> 08:53.920]  very important broadcast but just to give you an idea of how creepy and
[08:53.920 --> 08:59.600]  secretive and criminal and illegal this government is and just to give you an
[08:59.600 --> 09:05.320]  example of how we've been under global management for at least 50 years when the
[09:05.320 --> 09:10.320]  United States won World War two with England the British model of world
[09:10.320 --> 09:18.160]  government went into high swing and took over the planet and simultaneously 36
[09:18.160 --> 09:26.320]  years ago in England Canada the US Australia New Zealand and some areas
[09:26.320 --> 09:39.920]  of Europe blood was taken from all children born in hospitals and stored
[09:39.920 --> 09:47.200]  in United Nations eugenics databases now you can go to the University of Texas
[09:47.200 --> 09:55.800]  official website in San Antonio because they are one of four holders of North
[09:55.800 --> 10:09.000]  American blood Mexico Canada and the US they are one of the depositories now
[10:09.000 --> 10:15.520]  understand I had congressmen on about this a decade ago I had members of the
[10:15.520 --> 10:22.320]  Australian Parliament on discussing this when it was only secret documents and
[10:22.320 --> 10:26.200]  got called a kook and got called a nut and there's even been national newspaper
[10:26.200 --> 10:30.280]  article saying Jones is insane and believes the government takes babies
[10:30.280 --> 10:35.840]  blood secretly at birth but now that they're announcing it it's oh it's no
[10:35.840 --> 10:42.960]  big deal what's wrong with a secret DNA database and it's the same thing when
[10:42.960 --> 10:49.160]  you thumbprint at a tanning salon or a gym or a hospital or at the mall or to
[10:49.160 --> 10:54.560]  clock in at work all of that's under UN treaty for a cashless society system
[10:54.560 --> 11:01.080]  they're now unveiling when they body scan you at 214 US airports now they're
[11:01.080 --> 11:07.280]  going into 214 they're already in most of them that is used as a 360 biometric
[11:07.280 --> 11:13.640]  scan where special cameras can look right through your clothes and scan your
[11:13.640 --> 11:19.560]  entire body so even disguises won't work now they have heat residence
[11:19.560 --> 11:25.560]  signature tracking license plate reading software deployed for the last 20
[11:25.560 --> 11:31.600]  years we are in a complete and total scientific dictatorship walled off
[11:31.600 --> 11:37.120]  behind national security the technology we currently have on the ground level of
[11:37.120 --> 11:49.800]  civilization in society is at least 30 years suppressed 30 years retarded
[11:49.800 --> 11:59.560]  retrograde frozen slowly developing that's why I say sports don't matter and
[11:59.560 --> 12:05.840]  the stupid local nightly news doesn't matter about new fashion styles or who
[12:05.840 --> 12:10.280]  wants to be a millionaire dancing with the stars none of it matters we are on
[12:10.280 --> 12:18.200]  a planetoid covered with oceans and giant trees and birds flying around the sky
[12:18.200 --> 12:24.200]  and a giant Sun burning in the daytime and a moon in the evening hurtling
[12:24.200 --> 12:29.200]  through space we have a scientific dictatorship that's written hundreds of
[12:29.200 --> 12:35.800]  textbooks I own I mean there's no way to buy them all or read them all where they
[12:35.800 --> 12:39.640]  openly state it's a scientific dictatorship where they openly state
[12:39.640 --> 12:44.440]  technologies frozen where they openly state they're setting up a final grid to
[12:44.440 --> 12:49.720]  kill you and your family now I know 14 years ago when I got on air and told you
[12:49.720 --> 12:55.400]  they're taking baby's blood at birth to put it in a genome eugenics lab you
[12:55.400 --> 13:00.760]  didn't want to believe me even when I read the internal documents in the last
[13:00.760 --> 13:05.920]  year the state of Texas passed a law because they were getting sued people
[13:05.920 --> 13:10.240]  found out from this radio show and a few others this was happening they started
[13:10.240 --> 13:16.000]  suing in Michigan and Minnesota and Texas mainly also in Florida and so state
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.800]  legislators everywhere just passed law saying you know what we can take the
[13:19.800 --> 13:24.920]  blood kind of like oh well you caught a spying on you without warrants we'll just
[13:24.920 --> 13:29.800]  pass a law saying no more stinking warrants oh you caught us torturing
[13:29.800 --> 13:33.440]  we'll just pass a law saying we can torture oh you caught us taking your
[13:33.440 --> 13:38.760]  baby's blood for a DNA database and guess what they take the blood for how
[13:38.760 --> 13:42.200]  well you can go read on the federal government's own websites we've linked
[13:42.200 --> 13:45.720]  to it over the last few years you can go read University of Texas genetic
[13:45.720 --> 13:52.320]  research bio weapons they patent your baby's blood and isolate certain proteins
[13:52.320 --> 13:58.000]  and and other co-factors that are unique to your child and their data banking it
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.440]  this has come out in court cases the last five years one reason this was has
[14:01.440 --> 14:04.760]  gone mainstream San Francisco Chronicle had articles about it a few years ago
[14:04.760 --> 14:13.160]  that people go in to get gene therapy when they're 60 70 years old and they're
[14:13.160 --> 14:18.400]  told oh guess what in the 1950s you were part of a pilot project when they
[14:18.400 --> 14:23.280]  took blood from you in the army oh yeah I mean everyone's gotten their blood
[14:23.280 --> 14:27.960]  taken for the last 36 almost 37 but but most people had it taken even before
[14:27.960 --> 14:32.720]  that and they say we patented your blood and all the proteins and so you got to
[14:32.720 --> 14:39.320]  pay this private company to have your own gene therapy they're 30 years ahead of
[14:39.320 --> 14:46.160]  what we know at least that's bare minimum so remember everything you see out
[14:46.160 --> 14:51.160]  there on the street and on TV isn't isn't the whole story and how many times
[14:51.160 --> 14:56.120]  did I tell you they take your blood at birth criminally and then the news acts
[14:56.120 --> 14:59.280]  like it's kind of creepy but also introduces it to everybody like well
[14:59.280 --> 15:02.720]  maybe it's okay and why are people suing and well maybe there's a good
[15:02.720 --> 15:09.320]  reason they're doing it here is KXAN locally in Austin Texas 14 years after
[15:09.320 --> 15:17.280]  we broke it finally telling the truth but only part of it blood samples taken
[15:17.280 --> 15:21.920]  from every Texas newborn mixed with new concerns about Big Brother tonight
[15:21.920 --> 15:26.360]  Austin News investigates the one secret collection of blood a new law gives
[15:26.360 --> 15:30.920]  parents the right to have leftover blood samples destroyed but a loophole is
[15:30.920 --> 15:35.120]  raising some privacy concerns KXAN's Nancy Wilson is live with a story all
[15:35.120 --> 15:40.000]  new at 10 well every year about 400,000 babies are born in Texas now before
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.400]  they're discharged from the hospital they leave something behind for the state
[15:43.400 --> 15:48.800]  a sample of their DNA now the blood spots are used to screen for a list of life
[15:48.800 --> 15:53.080]  threatening diseases now this is a copy of a blood spot now while in the
[15:53.080 --> 15:57.440]  hospital babies heal will be pricked and five drops of blood are collected a
[15:57.440 --> 16:01.480]  couple weeks later another five drops of blood are taken at the pediatricians
[16:01.480 --> 16:05.560]  office and sent to the state now the newborn screening process only use one
[16:05.560 --> 16:10.200]  or two of the spots so what happens to their remaining samples well the state
[16:10.200 --> 16:14.880]  keeps them the problem they've been doing it for years unbeknownst to
[16:14.880 --> 16:22.800]  parents this is Joaquin when he was born a year ago his mother never dreamed as
[16:22.800 --> 16:28.520]  blood would be the focus of a federal lawsuit didn't even realize that he'll
[16:28.520 --> 16:32.160]  stick in the blood draw had occurred in the hospital state law requires that
[16:32.160 --> 16:36.160]  blood be taken from every baby born in Texas to screen for a variety of
[16:36.160 --> 16:40.120]  diseases I agree with the newborn testing I'm glad to know that my son
[16:40.120 --> 16:46.600]  doesn't have you know any kind of a ball disorder but then I just couldn't
[16:46.600 --> 16:50.480]  believe it she learned the state without her knowledge or consent was keeping
[16:50.480 --> 16:55.160]  her son's leftover blood samples made me really mad that nobody asked me
[16:55.160 --> 16:59.200]  whether they could keep my son's DNA the state didn't ask any of the parents
[16:59.200 --> 17:03.800]  whose children were born between 2002 and 2009 for permission to bank the
[17:03.800 --> 17:08.080]  millions of blood spots collected under the newborn screening program the blood
[17:08.080 --> 17:12.480]  spots are valuable for use in research Andrea is supportive of medical
[17:12.480 --> 17:18.400]  research but government still has to ask they can't just take it and everyone
[17:18.400 --> 17:21.680]  has the right to make that decision for themselves the state disagreed and said
[17:21.680 --> 17:25.000]  parents didn't have the right and then I find about this I thought this is
[17:25.000 --> 17:28.960]  something that we needed to get into litigation and get it stopped Harrington
[17:28.960 --> 17:33.840]  filed suit on behalf of Andrea and other parents the Texas legislature responded
[17:33.840 --> 17:37.440]  they passed a new law that allows the state to keep and use the samples for
[17:37.440 --> 17:41.520]  research but requires parents to be notified and allows parents to request
[17:41.520 --> 17:45.240]  that their child's blood spots be destroyed but it's not as simple as
[17:45.240 --> 17:48.680]  checking off a box when the samples are taken parents must fill out this
[17:48.680 --> 17:53.960]  special form then the state has 60 days to destroy the leftover blood spots but
[17:53.960 --> 17:57.480]  even if you request your child's blood samples be destroyed there's nothing in
[17:57.480 --> 18:01.320]  the law that forces the state to destroy the information collected from the
[18:01.320 --> 18:05.120]  samples the form says identifying information won't be released without
[18:05.120 --> 18:09.760]  parents consent unless otherwise provided by law patient privacy expert
[18:09.760 --> 18:15.040]  dr. Debra Peel says those words unless otherwise provided by law create a huge
[18:15.040 --> 18:19.760]  loophole it's not secret it means that they can share it and use it for
[18:19.760 --> 18:26.680]  research for public health there are many laws that allow the use of samples
[18:26.680 --> 18:31.760]  like newborn blood samples for public health uses and screening and so forth so
[18:31.760 --> 18:36.000]  no you are not protected the law allows the stored samples to be used in
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  research if approved by what's called an institutional review board that board
[18:40.000 --> 18:43.840]  is supposed to safeguard patients privacy but when we asked to attend a
[18:43.840 --> 18:47.960]  meeting we were told they were not open to the public the review board appointed
[18:47.960 --> 18:51.640]  to approve any research using the leftover samples is made up of almost
[18:51.640 --> 18:55.840]  all state employees Jim Harrington says that makes the whole process
[18:55.840 --> 19:00.040]  questionable this is a farce is because you're pulling people from inside the
[19:00.040 --> 19:05.080]  agency and who an agency that has part of a role to play in this entire
[19:05.080 --> 19:09.240]  transaction and asking the employees of the agency that has invested interest
[19:09.240 --> 19:13.560]  and passed judgment on the agency right now they're one of the chances of that
[19:13.560 --> 19:17.480]  happening that's something we won't know because the new law allows the program
[19:17.480 --> 19:21.480]  to operate in almost complete secrecy the public doesn't get to know how the
[19:21.480 --> 19:25.600]  blood samples will be used or what kind of research is being conducted the new
[19:25.600 --> 19:30.320]  law specifically says state employees and contractors can't be forced to testify
[19:30.320 --> 19:35.200]  or turn over any reports or records even under subpoena every time of course the
[19:35.200 --> 19:40.240]  government does that and is not open and clear and transparent it raises flags
[19:40.240 --> 19:44.400]  all over the place about what's really going on you know and what are they
[19:44.400 --> 19:50.000]  really up to it is there a larger agenda here that they don't want to tell us
[19:50.000 --> 19:55.640]  about and that's enough to convince Andrea Bellino to just say no for me and my family
[19:55.640 --> 20:01.520]  know you can't have DNA now so far more than 8,000 of the family to government

[24:28.680 --> 24:34.160]  that's linked up on info wars.com and prisonplanet.com if you want to
[24:34.160 --> 24:39.720]  actually see the video not just hear the audio as they just announced oh the
[24:39.720 --> 24:46.240]  government has been secretly taking your blood and putting it in DNA databases
[24:46.240 --> 24:50.000]  so now you know why the police are coming around to the schools taking
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.880]  digital thumb prints and hand prints and photos of your children digital photos
[24:54.880 --> 24:59.680]  it's all for the international databases and of course the average goody
[24:59.680 --> 25:04.160]  two-shoe cop if you tell them that they're part of this they're compartmentalized
[25:04.160 --> 25:08.800]  they don't know they'll say oh and UFOs are gonna get me Alex black
[25:08.800 --> 25:14.880]  helicopters they're taking the baby's blood for a DNA database next you're
[25:14.880 --> 25:18.760]  gonna tell me there's a new world order right oh well here I have all these
[25:18.760 --> 25:22.240]  world leaders calling for global government and global taxes no you
[25:22.240 --> 25:28.720]  don't and so there's all this denial until they openly announce it and then
[25:28.720 --> 25:33.400]  the establishment says so what no big deal no problem so here's the end of
[25:33.400 --> 25:38.760]  that clip I have to convince Andrea Bellino to just say no for me and my
[25:38.760 --> 25:44.720]  family no you can't have our DNA now so far more than 8,000 other families have
[25:44.720 --> 25:48.640]  made that same decision asking the state to destroy their child's leftover
[25:48.640 --> 25:52.240]  blood samples so Robert and Leslie what are the state lawmakers have to say well
[25:52.240 --> 25:55.000]  tomorrow night we talk with the legislator who sponsored the bill that's
[25:55.000 --> 25:58.720]  keeping this program secret and find out how other lawmakers will be taking a
[25:58.720 --> 26:03.640]  closer look at the program Nancy thanks for that we do have much more
[26:03.640 --> 26:08.080]  information for you on this issue on our website right now you'll find the
[26:08.080 --> 26:12.680]  text of the new law copies of the forms provided to parents the form if you
[26:12.680 --> 26:16.000]  wish to have your child's blood samples destroyed along with some federal
[26:16.000 --> 26:20.040]  legislation introduced by President Obama when he was a senator that would
[26:20.040 --> 26:24.320]  have created a national DNA database plus we have other information about the
[26:24.320 --> 26:28.440]  Texas state agency that oversees that newborn screening program and tomorrow
[26:28.440 --> 26:32.520]  at noon dr. Deborah Peel will join us for an online chat about patient
[26:32.520 --> 26:38.960]  privacy rights just go to kxan.com to participate okay now this is a lesson
[26:38.960 --> 26:45.400]  not just in government secrecy but in spin see they passed one state law where
[26:45.400 --> 26:50.600]  parents could opt out when they'd been doing it illegally before and then now
[26:50.600 --> 26:54.160]  they say oh we want another law to keep the program secret what we're doing with
[26:54.160 --> 26:59.760]  the blood ladies and gentlemen this was a DNA database from the time it was set
[26:59.760 --> 27:05.520]  up so see first they deny they're taking the blood and keeping it then they try
[27:05.520 --> 27:10.880]  to spin it and say well we're only looking at officially making it a DNA
[27:10.880 --> 27:16.040]  database it is a global DNA database so they're only letting the public know a
[27:16.040 --> 27:25.200]  little bit of this information now they're only unveiling the proverbial tip
[27:25.200 --> 27:36.760]  of the iceberg to the population and spinning it all into a big mess so people
[27:36.760 --> 27:44.520]  are confused by it but bottom line your blood for 36 years worldwide in the
[27:44.520 --> 27:54.120]  entire industrialized world under a UN program your blood is taken and is put
[27:54.120 --> 27:57.640]  in this database and is used for medical research and that's not even
[27:57.640 --> 28:03.040]  denied by the University of Texas that runs the program one of four universities
[28:03.040 --> 28:06.360]  running it in the United States and they get the federal grants and money to
[28:06.360 --> 28:08.720]  carry it out
[28:11.360 --> 28:16.960]  we're gonna get some guests on about this next week and give you the full
[28:16.960 --> 28:23.960]  details of what's happening but we go to all this trouble to expose that it's
[28:23.960 --> 28:32.000]  happening and when they finally admit it they spin it absolutely incredible
[28:32.000 --> 28:40.960]  but it's the same MO it's the same trick in 1994 Bill Clinton signed an
[28:40.960 --> 28:47.920]  executive order that the states wouldn't get their highway funds if they
[28:47.920 --> 28:52.480]  didn't put in thumb prints and digital photo systems for standardization of a
[28:52.480 --> 28:56.480]  national ID card I cover that in my first film America destroyed by design
[28:56.480 --> 29:05.480]  that we put out in 1997 so we had a national ID card in 1994 they're just
[29:05.480 --> 29:08.880]  now getting around to telling the public that their state drivers license are
[29:08.880 --> 29:12.840]  federally standardized and federally controlled and are really a national ID
[29:12.840 --> 29:17.560]  card and now the feds say hey we'll just issue you a hemispheric North American
[29:17.560 --> 29:25.480]  Union card you've seen those TV ads on television but by the time they tell you
[29:25.480 --> 29:31.720]  we've got a national ID card it's eight nine years after the UN treaty signed in
[29:31.720 --> 29:35.680]  Australia at a UN conference by the United States and England and others in
[29:35.680 --> 29:42.400]  2000 standardizing the global ID card so see you're already in a global DNA
[29:42.400 --> 29:47.240]  database and they're just now getting around to telling you all the states
[29:47.240 --> 29:50.280]  keeping your blood
[29:50.280 --> 29:57.200]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[31:03.040 --> 31:07.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double

[31:11.560 --> 31:15.560]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[31:15.560 --> 31:19.440]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[31:19.440 --> 31:23.680]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[31:23.680 --> 31:27.880]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[31:27.880 --> 31:32.160]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[31:32.160 --> 31:35.880]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[31:35.880 --> 31:40.080]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[33:49.000 --> 33:54.120]  program how to engage in fraud how to lie how they're cooking the numbers to
[33:54.120 --> 33:58.280]  show temperatures going up and they're going man this is hard they're going
[33:58.280 --> 34:02.920]  down how do we fix this well you do this you do that we're gonna go over some
[34:02.920 --> 34:07.760]  of the source code today as well I mean we have them absolutely caught red
[34:07.760 --> 34:12.560]  handed and this is also a great education and how their spin machine works
[34:12.560 --> 34:16.720]  because now the London Guardian has articles playing the victim oh there's
[34:16.720 --> 34:20.800]  persecution of these wonderful scientists they're up by the horrible
[34:20.800 --> 34:26.080]  demons that hacked these emails of they're being persecuted their victims of
[34:26.080 --> 34:32.040]  hate when you actually read the emails it's how to get scientists fired how to
[34:32.040 --> 34:37.320]  get people kicked off of their tenure how to get people removed how to
[34:37.320 --> 34:40.560]  persecute scientists that didn't agree with them how to keep them from getting
[34:40.560 --> 34:45.680]  published how to keep them from getting research funds how to secretly behind the
[34:45.680 --> 34:52.320]  scenes threaten peer-reviewed journals not to publish scientists work which
[34:52.320 --> 34:59.400]  ruins their careers they are out there persecuting people and then saying
[34:59.400 --> 35:08.120]  they're being persecuted it's just too rich so we're gonna be breaking all of
[35:08.120 --> 35:15.880]  that down on the economy front the real jobless rates 17.5 percent of workers
[35:15.880 --> 35:22.760]  are unemployed now that's CNBC why is this so important because when even
[35:22.760 --> 35:29.600]  mainline television hacks come out and say that the 10.2 percent number being
[35:29.600 --> 35:36.320]  put out by the commerce and departments of labor when even mainstream media says
[35:36.320 --> 35:42.840]  it's actually 17.5 and all the other real economists who are crunching the
[35:42.840 --> 35:47.320]  numbers say it's between 20 and 22 depending on whose numbers you look at
[35:47.320 --> 35:53.040]  so we got 20% unemployment in this country that's depression level and you
[35:53.040 --> 35:56.960]  got the federal government engaging in another mass hoax telling everybody
[35:56.960 --> 36:03.640]  that no it's only 10.2 also gold jumps to record a slumping dollar spurs
[36:03.640 --> 36:13.040]  investment demand to an all-time mega high an all-time mega high of one
[36:13.040 --> 36:21.120]  thousand one hundred and seventy four dollars an ounce that is huge also the
[36:21.120 --> 36:25.880]  FBI and Homeland Security reports we covered six years ago said that you're
[36:25.880 --> 36:29.640]  going to have to have a national ID card to have a job a national ID card to
[36:29.640 --> 36:32.960]  drive your car doesn't matter if you just have a driver's license it's also
[36:32.960 --> 36:37.520]  federalized they're gonna be random lockdowns on highways on streets on
[36:37.520 --> 36:43.240]  roads shopping malls are going to have metal detectors federal viper teams with
[36:43.240 --> 36:48.040]  federal marshals at the TSA are gonna run checkpoints everywhere it's now
[36:48.040 --> 36:53.560]  happening all over the news today Star Tribune Minneapolis Star Tribune
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.400]  first-ever lockdown drills today at Mall of America we're gonna be going over
[36:58.400 --> 37:07.400]  that also the Metro London newspaper reports Britain's back baby limit
[37:07.400 --> 37:11.520]  government is moving to depopulate Britain by at least 50 percent that's
[37:11.520 --> 37:15.400]  London Telegraph London Guardian both reporting on that as if it's a
[37:15.400 --> 37:20.760]  wonderful thing and it in this report it says a third of Britain's would support
[37:20.760 --> 37:26.600]  a law capping the number of children per family to one get ready it's coming
[37:26.600 --> 37:32.720]  here taxes for more than one child and then that gets into all of the climate
[37:32.720 --> 37:38.120]  fraud because the look the the climate cultists aren't tree hugging liberals I
[37:38.120 --> 37:46.000]  want to make this clear they actually could care less about the environment
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.960]  they believe they're going to become gods with high-tech systems they don't
[37:49.960 --> 37:53.120]  care about true environmental threats like genetic engineering with cross
[37:53.120 --> 37:59.800]  species I'm gonna talk more about this next hour they hate fellow humans they
[37:59.800 --> 38:03.920]  want to control life and death they want to shut your resources off I want to
[38:03.920 --> 38:09.960]  describe to you exactly who we're dealing with and these arrogant swollen
[38:09.960 --> 38:15.560]  power-tripping scientists are all members of eugenics societies every
[38:15.560 --> 38:19.960]  stinking one of them I can take a top climate scientist who's pushing man-made
[38:19.960 --> 38:24.240]  global warming and calling for global carbon taxes and global carbon ration
[38:24.240 --> 38:29.480]  cards and I can put their name in after the term sustainability eugenics
[38:29.480 --> 38:34.720]  population reduction and they're always signing letters and writing books and
[38:34.720 --> 38:40.560]  going to conferences it's a cult we got a murdering Nazi death cult and control
[38:40.560 --> 38:48.680]  of our society and people better grow up and realize it I was right about gold
[38:48.680 --> 38:54.200]  going up I was right about stage terror attacks I was right in January about how
[38:54.200 --> 38:57.920]  they were gonna have a big flu scare when nobody was talking about it I was
[38:57.920 --> 39:02.200]  right about how they're taking your baby's blood for 36 almost 37 years at
[39:02.200 --> 39:06.120]  birth and putting in an international UN database now it's mainstream media I
[39:06.120 --> 39:12.440]  don't make any of this up do you understand we don't have time to screw
[39:12.440 --> 39:17.160]  around and live in denial anymore and don't roll your eyes out there if you're
[39:17.160 --> 39:21.480]  a new listener and say this guy's a nut listen to me you better then go prove I'm
[39:21.480 --> 39:25.120]  a nut because I know when you try to go disprove what I'm saying you're gonna
[39:25.120 --> 39:32.880]  find out it's even worse than I can even describe to you all right that's
[39:32.880 --> 39:40.040]  coming up to it's just it's absolutely mind-blowing what's going on and what's
[39:40.040 --> 39:43.360]  happening by the way I got a call from Charlie Sheen this morning for people

[40:11.440 --> 40:17.280]  he's real sick and we'll get better in a few days and we'll do that and I've
[40:17.280 --> 40:19.560]  already contacted the first place winner to let him know he'll be on with us
[40:19.560 --> 40:23.240]  next week and so we'll announce all that very very soon very very exciting with
[40:23.240 --> 40:28.600]  20 months for the president you can see links to all the great entries at 20
[40:28.600 --> 40:32.440]  minutes with the president calm well there's a big link at info wars.com and

[40:50.120 --> 40:58.480]  his little book it's a very easy read and I decided I wanted to get him on the
[40:58.480 --> 41:02.200]  show of this just for you know five six seven minutes to talk about it because
[41:02.200 --> 41:07.920]  it really does have some great ideas and great solutions and he's also running
[41:07.920 --> 41:11.480]  for elected office and I like from time to time have people on who we know are
[41:11.480 --> 41:15.240]  patriots who are running for political office to give some give them some
[41:15.240 --> 41:19.480]  attention in their area and you might have also heard an ad running on Genesis

[42:37.520 --> 42:42.800]  lived in low-dag California since I was 13 years old by the age of 15 I met my
[42:42.800 --> 42:48.840]  wife Nicole at the age of 17 we were married with their first son and as
[42:48.840 --> 42:54.480]  you can imagine at 17 it was a lot of responsibility put on my shoulders so
[42:54.480 --> 43:00.360]  we were we were dirt porn we got married we had to rely on bootstamps and
[43:00.360 --> 43:05.280]  welfare and government assistance to make it as big as the time of my life that
[43:05.280 --> 43:10.080]  I'm not proud of but you know I took night classes and I worked several jobs
[43:10.080 --> 43:14.280]  and after a while I landed a pretty decent job at a construction company and
[43:14.280 --> 43:18.760]  after a couple years I basically ended up running the place I was always telling
[43:18.760 --> 43:22.280]  the boss hey you know if we did it this way we could be more efficient or more
[43:22.280 --> 43:27.080]  productive or more profitable and he told me look if you can do a better job
[43:27.080 --> 43:32.440]  then go start your own company so that's what I did so since 2004 I've created
[43:32.440 --> 43:37.040]  several businesses that created hundreds of jobs for Californians I've got
[43:37.040 --> 43:39.880]  investment properties all over the country and I wrote this book called
[43:39.880 --> 43:44.840]  here's what you do to help other people become successful as well and now I'm
[43:44.840 --> 43:53.880]  running for office to try and help out even more tell us what political office
[43:53.880 --> 43:58.360]  you're running for Robert I'm running for Congress here in district 11 it's a

[44:10.320 --> 44:15.720]  it's gonna do a bunch of good it really is it's a huge district I'd have a lot
[44:15.720 --> 44:20.520]  of say is the best place to find out about the campaign and how to get
[44:20.520 --> 44:25.400]  involved Robert Beatles org you know that that is that's the best place to
[44:25.400 --> 44:29.120]  find out more about me in the campaign we've also got a money bomb going right
[44:29.120 --> 44:33.200]  now we're trying to raise the money that's Robert Beatles.org would be the best
[44:33.200 --> 44:38.760]  place to go well tell the listeners about some of the information that's
[44:38.760 --> 44:43.480]  covered in your book here's what you do well basically it's it's the way I made
[44:43.480 --> 44:48.520]  my money I tried to put it into 72 pages just easy to follow easy to
[44:48.520 --> 44:53.320]  understand English that anybody could prosper from it so it's not rocket
[44:53.320 --> 44:59.080]  science it's just how I made my money safe investments to put your money you
[44:59.080 --> 45:03.360]  know once you make it and it goes into a little bit in depth as far as where to
[45:03.360 --> 45:07.000]  get money if you don't have it you know it's tough for people right now
[45:07.000 --> 45:11.560]  especially this economy to you know to be able to invest it's hard enough just
[45:11.560 --> 45:15.440]  to just to make it just to survive so in this book it tells you where to find
[45:15.440 --> 45:22.440]  some money and how to make it. Well it's a great book and people of course can go
[45:22.440 --> 45:27.800]  to here's what you do.net and get a e-book how do people get a hard copy of
[45:27.800 --> 45:32.120]  the book? At the same place you can go to actually right now we're running a kind of
[45:32.120 --> 45:38.320]  special it's if you go to here's what you do.net port slash free you'll
[45:38.320 --> 45:43.560]  actually get a free chapter from the book here's what you do.net port slash
[45:43.560 --> 45:49.840]  free. I like the site you've got how would you fix the USA.com now that's
[45:49.840 --> 45:54.680]  kind of an interesting angle tell us about that. My buddy Nick Goldberg out of
[45:54.680 --> 45:58.520]  Australia he's a great guy I met actually from your show I've met a lot of good
[45:58.520 --> 46:04.280]  people to the show and he helped me build or rather he built it how would you
[46:04.280 --> 46:08.520]  fix the USA.com it's where people can voice their opinions on what's wrong with
[46:08.520 --> 46:12.860]  the government you know how they would fix it if I'm elected I'd be taking all
[46:12.860 --> 46:16.920]  their ideas and all their comments to Washington with me. We really need to get
[46:16.920 --> 46:20.520]  this country back on track and important to the people you know they have a voice
[46:20.520 --> 46:29.480]  doing it. Well again I just hope that people will read your book I read it I
[46:29.480 --> 46:33.440]  learned a lot myself again the more you learn the more you don't know that old
[46:33.440 --> 46:36.960]  cliche that old men would always tell me when I was a young whipper snapper
[46:36.960 --> 46:40.080]  teenager they'd say boy you think you know everything you're gonna find out
[46:40.080 --> 46:44.040]  how much you don't know and that's what freaks me out is that I know more than
[46:44.040 --> 46:49.720]  most people on general issues on a wide range than most people out there do and
[46:49.720 --> 46:54.320]  I realize how much I don't know and then I realize how much the globalists do
[46:54.320 --> 46:57.760]  know everything they're about is knowledge and information and how
[46:57.760 --> 47:03.000]  systems work and also making people feel powerless when really we have amazing
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.520]  power and I think that's the overriding message in what Robert Meebles is doing
[47:06.520 --> 47:09.400]  and your run for Congress and the different sites you've started in the
[47:09.400 --> 47:13.480]  book you've written just another testament to what other people can do and
[47:13.480 --> 47:16.960]  no writing your books not gonna save the world my films aren't gonna save the
[47:16.960 --> 47:21.120]  world my books won't save the world senator in hoff you know putting an
[47:21.120 --> 47:24.280]  all-in-the-line five years ago to say that the man-made climate change was a
[47:24.280 --> 47:28.240]  hoax a fraud for taxes you know that wasn't gonna save the world Ron Paul
[47:28.240 --> 47:32.680]  30 plus years trying to audit the Fed that won't save the world though it's
[47:32.680 --> 47:36.720]  going a long ways towards it its resistance and telling the truth and
[47:36.720 --> 47:42.280]  getting involved all of us together can back evil into a corner instead of
[47:42.280 --> 47:48.200]  having it running wild and ruling over so very very exciting how do you fix the
[47:48.200 --> 47:54.520]  USA comm here's what you do dot Ned and Robert Beatles dot org and if folks
[47:54.520 --> 47:57.600]  want to volunteer to help out the campaign how do they do that well they
[47:57.600 --> 48:01.200]  would just go to Robert Beatles dot org we've got a money bomb going you know

[48:08.040 --> 48:11.520]  people very exciting Robert thank you for spending time with us we'll talk to
[48:11.520 --> 48:16.080]  again soon you bet there goes Robert Beatles ladies and gentlemen I wanted
[48:16.080 --> 48:18.920]  to have him on because he's been supported with a show and has a good
[48:18.920 --> 48:22.520]  little booklet a very easy read for people a lot of folks who even know the
[48:22.520 --> 48:25.960]  basics of business and life and there's a lot of different ways to be successful
[48:25.960 --> 48:29.720]  in business but this is just one more way and I think it's interesting you knew
[48:29.720 --> 48:35.240]  this was going to happen you knew this was going to develop you know just
[48:35.240 --> 48:39.360]  before Robert Beatles came on I pointed out how I can take the name of any
[48:39.360 --> 48:45.240]  global warming honcho of hundreds and hundreds of scientists that I've done
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.600]  this with their names who are out at town halls and giving speeches and going
[48:49.600 --> 48:55.480]  on radio saying you've got to pass the climate tax now we're all dead by 2010
[48:55.480 --> 48:59.720]  they were saying this a year ago everything will flood we're dead if you
[48:59.720 --> 49:04.040]  don't give us the the power and we've got to restrict and have one child
[49:04.040 --> 49:10.480]  policies guess who it now turns out from Canadian free press comm and they
[49:10.480 --> 49:13.640]  have the documents is now going up on prison planet dot com and info wars
[49:13.640 --> 49:19.880]  dot com guess who was involved honchoing most of the cover-up in the last
[49:19.880 --> 49:24.920]  decade involved in climate gate with us and British and you and scientists guess
[49:24.920 --> 49:30.160]  whose name has now come out in the emails and who is involved hold your
[49:30.160 --> 49:38.720]  breath think I bet who do I what book do I hold up every day on the TV show who
[49:38.720 --> 49:43.960]  do I talk about every day as the kingpin when it comes to actually drawing up the
[49:43.960 --> 49:47.840]  current strategy he didn't develop the original strategy over a hundred years
[49:47.840 --> 49:55.360]  old for eugenics global government extermination but his plan in 1976 was

[54:19.400 --> 54:26.720]  new turn jet if I could yeah will you let me make one please one sentence this is
[54:26.720 --> 54:31.040]  out of his speech that I made Melanie back on the floor of the Senate and it
[54:31.040 --> 54:34.640]  was repeated John gives he picked it up and put it in human events this is four
[54:34.640 --> 54:39.040]  years ago in talking about the science cooking the science I said I would
[54:39.040 --> 54:44.360]  discuss the systematic and documented abuse of the scientific process by which
[54:44.360 --> 54:48.120]  an international body that claims it provides the most complete and objective
[54:48.120 --> 54:51.880]  science assessment in the world on the subject of climate change the United
[54:51.880 --> 54:56.960]  Nations IPCC now that was four years ago so we we knew they're cooking the
[54:56.960 --> 55:01.520]  science back then and you've been talking about the you know what's
[55:01.520 --> 55:06.120]  happened recently with the bloggers coming up with what's what what they
[55:06.120 --> 55:08.520]  did with that let me interrupt you there center because I think that's a
[55:08.520 --> 55:10.680]  really important point ladies and gentlemen if you haven't followed that
[55:10.680 --> 55:16.080]  story when senator hoffs talking about now in Britain a blogger got into some
[55:16.080 --> 55:20.520]  of the official government records about climate change and how the
[55:20.520 --> 55:24.320]  measurements were being taken to show politics behind it well but but they
[55:24.320 --> 55:28.320]  were basically saying oh yeah hey let's let's make it look like Jim you know so
[55:28.320 --> 55:31.920]  and so did that and let's let's help him cook the books and let's change the
[55:31.920 --> 55:36.640]  data it's all people who don't agree with it but it's all a huge fraud I mean
[55:36.640 --> 55:41.280]  senator am I exaggerating no you're not if you remember that mine was the hoax
[55:41.280 --> 55:46.040]  statement that's what five years ago I guess we're gonna give you a big pat on
[55:46.040 --> 55:49.880]  the back for being fresh yeah you deserve it at a boy and now you are
[55:49.880 --> 55:55.920]  finally being vindicated well on this thing it is pretty serious and since
[55:55.920 --> 55:58.560]  you know Barbara Boxer is the chairman and I'm the ranking member on
[55:58.560 --> 56:03.440]  environment public works if nothing happens in the next seven days when we
[56:03.440 --> 56:08.840]  go back into session a week from today that would change this situation I will
[56:08.840 --> 56:13.040]  call for an investigation because this thing is serious you think about the
[56:13.040 --> 56:17.280]  literally millions of dollars that have been thrown away on some of this stuff
[56:17.280 --> 56:20.480]  that they that they came out with so what will you be calling for an
[56:20.480 --> 56:25.720]  investigation of how the on the IPCC and on the United Nations on the way that
[56:25.720 --> 56:30.960]  they cook the science to make this thing look as if the science was settled
[56:30.960 --> 56:35.320]  when all the time of course we knew it was not should somebody stop further
[56:35.320 --> 56:38.600]  spending on this until we get this investigation center well I don't know
[56:38.600 --> 56:41.960]  how you do that though because we're not the ones who are calling the shots of
[56:41.960 --> 56:46.720]  the interesting part of this is it's happening right before Copenhagen and so
[56:46.720 --> 56:51.520]  the timing couldn't be better whoever whoever is on the ball in Great
[56:51.520 --> 56:55.880]  Britain their timing was good well senator thank you very much all right
[56:55.880 --> 57:02.920]  coming back and and wanted to play that because Mark Murano who is joining us was
[57:02.920 --> 57:06.600]  the chief of staff for senator inhofe on the committee on environment and
[57:06.600 --> 57:12.240]  public works five years ago and was one of the minds behind educating senator
[57:12.240 --> 57:18.280]  inhofe early on not that inhofe isn't really on the ball on so many subjects I
[57:18.280 --> 57:23.280]  disagree with him on a few issues but he really has been the leader against the
[57:23.280 --> 57:27.760]  climate the man-made climate change fraud the man-made climate change hoax
[57:27.760 --> 57:31.920]  we're going to detail all this with mark coming up in the next hour and then we've
[57:31.920 --> 57:37.920]  also got climatologist dr. timothy ball joining us he was persecuted by these
[57:37.920 --> 57:40.440]  people you know it's not just a scientific fraud it's how they went out
[57:40.440 --> 57:43.880]  and persecuted people and now we know john p. holdrum was one of the prime
[57:43.880 --> 57:50.160]  movers dr. death calling for drugging the water sterilizing the population
[57:50.160 --> 57:54.240]  secretly folks it's just like how they were taking baby's blood 36 years ago
[57:54.240 --> 57:58.640]  and now they admit it for DNA databases they've been putting poison in the water
[57:58.640 --> 58:04.000]  to sterilize you they don't just put fluoride in they put between 150 and
[58:04.000 --> 58:09.000]  300 plus chemicals depending on the water system in and dozens of them are
[58:09.000 --> 58:13.280]  known to sterilize you're being sterilized your government is a bunch of
[58:13.280 --> 58:17.760]  criminal psychopathic murderers did you hear inhofe there's nothing he can do to
[58:17.760 --> 58:23.120]  stop him he doesn't run any of it it's the you in and the White House he can't
[58:23.120 --> 58:26.360]  even do anything against these people other than expose them and this is all
[58:26.360 --> 58:31.480]  about the fight to get this story out there is a news blackout on CNN and many
[58:31.480 --> 58:36.360]  other channels we have to at the grassroots yard-by-yard carry the ball of

[1:00:57.600 --> 1:01:04.720]  journal detailing how it's man-made and documenting that it's impossible that it
[1:01:04.720 --> 1:01:16.960]  was naturally occurring off the charts I mean it's just it's so incredible and
[1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:21.120]  again we did a search of the CNN website so did several other news agencies and
[1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:26.320]  they did one link in their tech section to wired magazine but they never reported
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:30.080]  it so they had one link but never on television and never in an article they
[1:01:30.080 --> 1:01:37.000]  wrote or did we need to have protest now in front of CNN Center in Atlanta or
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:41.880]  CNN Center in Los Angeles and Radio City or CNN Center New York I mean people
[1:01:41.880 --> 1:01:46.000]  need to be out there bullhorning them and you know why because it'll get in the
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.800]  local newspapers that they're not reporting on it we've got to break this
[1:01:48.800 --> 1:01:54.000]  blockade ladies and gentlemen this is the equivalent of silver bullets to
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:00.840]  werewolves to wooden stakes and crosses and holy water to vampires if we dump
[1:02:00.840 --> 1:02:04.800]  the holy water on them if we jam a stake in their heart and the info or they're
[1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:12.600]  going to burn up into dust but having the plans to the Death Star doesn't blow
[1:02:12.600 --> 1:02:19.800]  the Death Star up you've got to go into the superstructure and engage them holy
[1:02:19.800 --> 1:02:26.880]  mackerel it's tearing me up because just their spin their response how they're
[1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:32.160]  demonizing people that have exposed them the different tricks the fact that
[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:35.800]  John P. Holdren the guy that wrote eco science calling for killing the majority
[1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:39.280]  of the public the fact that the White House science are admits he's Kim
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:43.440]  trailing us now they're spraying all of us they're poisoning our water they
[1:02:43.440 --> 1:02:49.720]  admit it these people have to be brought to justice instead at every public
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:53.800]  school in this country most the private schools everywhere you know I homeschool
[1:02:53.800 --> 1:02:59.200]  my children because I looked at probably 20 30 private schools even big
[1:02:59.200 --> 1:03:05.440]  private Christian schools in Austin and they all teach global warming is man-made
[1:03:05.440 --> 1:03:14.240]  and evil they all see any accredited school teaches this filth period we've
[1:03:14.240 --> 1:03:17.800]  got to take our PTAs over our city councils our county commissioners our
[1:03:17.800 --> 1:03:21.360]  police departments the internationalist have come in with their unlimited money
[1:03:21.360 --> 1:03:24.640]  that they proud of nothing and they bought off our communities and their
[1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:27.480]  brainwashing our kids and they're teaching them that we've got to have
[1:03:27.480 --> 1:03:32.320]  one child policies and they're taken over and we have their internal emails
[1:03:32.320 --> 1:03:35.640]  and documents where they admit it's all a fraud and they know it's a fraud and
[1:03:35.640 --> 1:03:39.680]  how they persecute real scientists that tell the truth then they say the oil
[1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:43.400]  companies are funding people that criticize them when actually the oil
[1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:49.680]  companies are funding them just like the insurance companies are openly
[1:03:49.680 --> 1:03:53.880]  funding and wrote the health care bill but the media says the rich insurance
[1:03:53.880 --> 1:03:58.080]  companies are against it but even the New York Times last week had that article
[1:03:58.080 --> 1:04:01.400]  admitting that talking points were written by big pharma for both the
[1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:04.760]  Republicans and the Democrats on both sides to make it look like there's a
[1:04:04.760 --> 1:04:08.680]  debate and they're helping Republicans look like they're against it but still
[1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:13.840]  vote for it and it turns out the Republicans use the talking points the
[1:04:13.840 --> 1:04:19.000]  leadership did I mean it's all staged except for a few people like Ron Paul
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:25.200]  and Michelle Bachman and Senator in Hoff there's a few of them and they're
[1:04:25.200 --> 1:04:28.640]  they're not Ron Paul's close to perfect but the others aren't perfect but they're
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:33.040]  getting demonized because they're not under globalist control in Hoff they
[1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:36.680]  tried to kill him he even talked about that his plane took off the propeller
[1:04:36.680 --> 1:04:40.840]  fell off and when the mechanics looked at it was at seven years ago they said
[1:04:40.840 --> 1:04:47.800]  this was sabotage in Hoff survived assassination attempts these people make
[1:04:47.800 --> 1:04:52.680]  me sick and they're not liberals get that through your head they're not
[1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:56.080]  environmental tree huggers they're a bunch of murdering control freak
[1:04:56.080 --> 1:05:02.160]  eugenicists masquerading is up any liberals that love everybody hundreds of
[1:05:02.160 --> 1:05:06.360]  nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[1:05:06.360 --> 1:05:11.400]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[1:05:11.400 --> 1:05:14.960]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've turned in this
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:20.040]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[1:05:20.040 --> 1:05:25.400]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[1:05:25.400 --> 1:05:30.320]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel

[1:08:03.400 --> 1:08:08.640]  our tea is back in Austin Texas catching up with radio host and documentary
[1:08:08.640 --> 1:08:13.560]  filmmaker Alex Jones Alex thank you for joining us again thank you last time we
[1:08:13.560 --> 1:08:17.560]  were here in your studios was a couple of months after the inauguration now
[1:08:17.560 --> 1:08:22.120]  America has marked a year since it elected Barack Obama what promises of
[1:08:22.120 --> 1:08:26.360]  change have actually materialized from the day he was elected before even took
[1:08:26.360 --> 1:08:31.280]  office we knew because of his advisors being people from the Clinton and Bush
[1:08:31.280 --> 1:08:36.080]  administration before him that he was going to break all his promises but he's
[1:08:36.080 --> 1:08:40.600]  gone back on his word in our history even worse than we thought he was in two
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:45.640]  wars he took 50,000 troops out of Iraq but put contractors in fundamentals he
[1:08:45.640 --> 1:08:51.040]  has escalated the troop search in Afghanistan by over 30,000 and he's
[1:08:51.040 --> 1:08:56.800]  now said he's going to send an additional 40,000 to over 340,000 US
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:03.000]  coalition and Afghan troops total there outnumbering the supposed Taliban 12 to
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:09.440]  1 so he lied about the war in fact he's a bigger war monger than George Bush in
[1:09:09.440 --> 1:09:13.040]  many respects but again Obama's just a puppet he's carrying out the policies
[1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:16.720]  of the Anglo-American establishment of the military industrial complex he's
[1:09:16.720 --> 1:09:21.760]  giving that left cover he also said that he was going to make the White House and
[1:09:21.760 --> 1:09:26.400]  government totally transparent he's made who visits the White House secret he
[1:09:26.400 --> 1:09:32.240]  said that he was going to end the process of rendition secret arrest secret
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:37.720]  torture he's actually expanded that to indefinite detention so worse than
[1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:42.720]  George W. Bush if it's actually possible he said he was going to bring the big
[1:09:42.720 --> 1:09:47.520]  banks to justice and he's actually opened the floodgates even more corruption
[1:09:47.520 --> 1:09:53.880]  by our Western oligarchs so Obama has taken all the previous corruption to a
[1:09:53.880 --> 1:09:57.960]  new level in less than a year in office this is official numbers Barack Obama
[1:09:57.960 --> 1:10:03.240]  has spent more money than all presidents before him your latest film is fall of the
[1:10:03.240 --> 1:10:06.440]  Republic do you really believe the United States could be on its way to
[1:10:06.440 --> 1:10:11.520]  collapse the United States if it's going to fall will only fall from within and
[1:10:11.520 --> 1:10:16.880]  yes the globalists are not mismanaging things they want to bankrupt the US they
[1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:20.320]  want to bring it down the third world status so they can further loot the
[1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:23.360]  economy this is stated in their own documents so these guys are holding our
[1:10:23.360 --> 1:10:27.920]  economy hostage and they want a weakened America they've used us as the muscle for
[1:10:27.920 --> 1:10:31.480]  their empire they've used our tax money to fund their empire now they're
[1:10:31.480 --> 1:10:35.080]  completing their empire and they want to move the power structure away from the
[1:10:35.080 --> 1:10:39.680]  United States to China and Europe you often call upon the American people to
[1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:43.360]  rise up and save their country a revolution basically do you think this
[1:10:43.360 --> 1:10:46.800]  is a good idea and what could come out of it and how could it really happen in
[1:10:46.800 --> 1:10:51.520]  the United States our republic is falling that's why I've made the film fall
[1:10:51.520 --> 1:10:57.560]  of the Republic I'm calling for a revolution of ideas a renaissance an
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:04.040]  awakening to true free market not this phony crony mutant form of capitalism
[1:11:04.040 --> 1:11:08.800]  that's not free market that's really a oligopoly or a monopoly of the elite I'm
[1:11:08.800 --> 1:11:13.080]  calling for a peaceful revolution under the Bill of Rights and Constitution the
[1:11:13.080 --> 1:11:17.200]  people's right in the Declaration of Independence to take their government
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:21.040]  back when it becomes oppressive and tyrannical and by every yardstick by
[1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:25.200]  every measure we have a tyrannical oppressive government that violates
[1:11:25.200 --> 1:11:29.200]  the Bill of Rights and Constitution that violates our laws and that is basically
[1:11:29.200 --> 1:11:33.840]  being used as tools as private interest to loot the people I don't want to have
[1:11:33.840 --> 1:11:38.040]  a military coup that would probably just turn into some other form of tyranny or
[1:11:38.040 --> 1:11:42.000]  fascism you've compared the current situation in America to George Orwell's
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:47.840]  novel 1984 is big brother really watching Americans and how big brother is
[1:11:47.840 --> 1:11:51.640]  watching Americans and big brother wants people to know they've gone in the
[1:11:51.640 --> 1:11:55.880]  last few years from denying that the national security agency is spying on
[1:11:55.880 --> 1:11:59.600]  Americans without warrants to saying hey we're listening to your cell phones
[1:11:59.600 --> 1:12:04.160]  we're reading all your emails the NSA is building snooping centers all over the
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:08.840]  country admitting they quote may shut the internet down during emergencies or
[1:12:08.840 --> 1:12:13.120]  during crises there's open discussions of restricting free speech in the
[1:12:13.120 --> 1:12:17.200]  United States not free speech in the streets but free speech online free
[1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:21.760]  speech in newspapers the American people have laid down for a long time but I
[1:12:21.760 --> 1:12:25.560]  notice is the system tries to squeeze us and push us around people are really
[1:12:25.560 --> 1:12:29.000]  starting to wake up and get angry and so the globalist are pushing it a little
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:33.160]  too far in your film fall of the republic you mentioned the possibility of a
[1:12:33.160 --> 1:12:37.040]  union being formed between the United States Canada and Mexico who would be
[1:12:37.040 --> 1:12:41.440]  interested in this and could this ever really happen a North American Union was
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:46.960]  formed in 2005 at Baylor University in Waco Texas they signed a secret treaty
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:51.080]  several years later through Freedom Information Act request we were able to
[1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:56.720]  get the minutes of that meeting and the Banff Canada meeting where the security
[1:12:56.720 --> 1:13:00.480]  and prosperity partnership openly announced we're going to use terrorism as
[1:13:00.480 --> 1:13:04.440]  a pretext to take over we're going to use the threat of manmade global warming
[1:13:04.440 --> 1:13:10.280]  which is manufactured as a pretext to restrict everybody's resources and tax
[1:13:10.280 --> 1:13:13.920]  the people and give the money to the offshore banks that we're deep in debt
[1:13:13.920 --> 1:13:18.680]  to and so we're already in a North American Union by stealth Americans
[1:13:18.680 --> 1:13:22.440]  will not be told until later that we're really under a North American Union and
[1:13:22.440 --> 1:13:26.360]  the reason the elites want us under this North American Union is they can
[1:13:26.360 --> 1:13:30.520]  bypass the Bill of Rights the Constitution due process by giving regulatory
[1:13:30.520 --> 1:13:35.560]  power to private corporations and to unelected bureaucracies they can remove
[1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:40.760]  laws they can set up the new structure in a way that gives them more power in
[1:13:40.760 --> 1:13:45.840]  your film you also talk about the economic crisis being part of a bigger
[1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:50.200]  strategy a bigger plan can you explain this to us absolutely the globalist own
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:55.040]  documents clearly state that they have engineered the global financial crisis as
[1:13:55.040 --> 1:13:59.240]  a pretext to bring in a new system private banks that make up the private
[1:13:59.240 --> 1:14:02.960]  fellow reserve and Bank of England system like Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase and
[1:14:02.960 --> 1:14:07.880]  others are on record that that some of these banks were actually engineering
[1:14:07.880 --> 1:14:12.760]  the housing crises to get the bailout to get all this unlimited taxpayer
[1:14:12.760 --> 1:14:16.360]  money in the name of fixing the mortgages and then it came out that they
[1:14:16.360 --> 1:14:19.640]  never even use that money for the mortgages they use it to buy gold they
[1:14:19.640 --> 1:14:25.640]  use it to buy real estate they use it to buy companies and media and power and so
[1:14:25.640 --> 1:14:31.160]  clearly they need to implode the economy so that their cash rich when
[1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:35.760]  everybody else is cash poor so they can come in and consolidate the world economy
[1:14:35.760 --> 1:14:40.760]  and also threaten the population they can threaten the population and say if
[1:14:40.760 --> 1:14:44.600]  you don't give the banks even more power and control if you don't give the IMF
[1:14:44.600 --> 1:14:48.280]  this new power to levy carbon taxes if you don't let us set up our new world
[1:14:48.280 --> 1:14:51.560]  order we're going to have a deeper depression so they've got a gun to our
[1:14:51.560 --> 1:14:55.480]  head saying you've got to submit to us give us all the power or you'll be
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:14:59.320]  destroyed but it's the very same central banks that engineered the economic
[1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:04.000]  crises that are now offering us their solution how do you think the millions
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:08.720]  of people who are homeless and jobless are feeling about being a means for a
[1:15:08.720 --> 1:15:12.480]  bigger goal the people know they're being raped the people know they're being
[1:15:12.480 --> 1:15:16.480]  robbed and they're very very angry and they're angry at both political parties
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:20.040]  and there's a sense of desperation because no matter what we do the same
[1:15:20.040 --> 1:15:23.760]  corrupt elite just continue to rob us continue to steal from us continue to
[1:15:23.760 --> 1:15:29.080]  destroy our economy by design this is a controlled demolition of our economy are
[1:15:29.080 --> 1:15:33.320]  you expecting an eventual collapse of the dollar yes we are seeing an
[1:15:33.320 --> 1:15:39.240]  engineered incremental collapse of the dollar it's not Europe and China and
[1:15:39.240 --> 1:15:42.480]  Russia and the Middle East who are destroying the dollar it is the private
[1:15:42.480 --> 1:15:45.960]  central banks that control the United States in England they have made the
[1:15:45.960 --> 1:15:50.400]  decision to slowly kill the dollar because on the way down as the dollars
[1:15:50.400 --> 1:15:55.240]  devalued okay we are back live you can see the last five minutes of that 11
[1:15:55.240 --> 1:15:58.400]  minute interview Russia today the equivalent of Russia singing in it
[1:15:58.400 --> 1:16:02.840]  airs all over the world did with me a few weeks ago they aired it yesterday
[1:16:02.840 --> 1:16:08.440]  they also interviewed me live on climategate so the Russian media is not
[1:16:08.440 --> 1:16:12.320]  going along with global warming and have stated it is a fraud a global tax
[1:16:12.320 --> 1:16:17.040]  because the UN actually says it's a global tax and all the independent
[1:16:17.040 --> 1:16:21.320]  scientists have pointed out that all the thermometers on the globe all the
[1:16:21.320 --> 1:16:26.200]  weather stations show that the earth is actually getting colder it was heating
[1:16:26.200 --> 1:16:31.880]  part of a natural process and the media always aims cameras at smokestacks that
[1:16:31.880 --> 1:16:35.480]  have water vapor coming out of them and tell the public it's toxic waste but
[1:16:35.480 --> 1:16:39.200]  don't warn the public about any of the real environmental problems we have the
[1:16:39.200 --> 1:16:42.800]  globalist could care less about the environment they want the planet under
[1:16:42.800 --> 1:16:50.200]  their control they are highly predatory on the economic front CNBC reports the
[1:16:50.200 --> 1:16:56.160]  jobless rate the real jobless rate 17.5 of workers are unemployed now the
[1:16:56.160 --> 1:16:59.880]  White House says 10.2 the real numbers from the economists we've talked to are
[1:16:59.880 --> 1:17:05.600]  over 20 20 to 22 and that's even in the mainstream news as well but now CNBC
[1:17:05.600 --> 1:17:11.000]  saying 17.5 that again that is depression level goal jumps to record is
[1:17:11.000 --> 1:17:15.680]  slumping dollars per investment demand goal may surge to 1,500 announced over
[1:17:15.680 --> 1:17:20.040]  the next 18 months Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts said today in a
[1:17:20.040 --> 1:17:25.160]  report that's not Ted Anderson that's not Alex Jones saying that that's Bank of
[1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:29.320]  America and Merrill Lynch let's briefly bring up Ted Anderson for his once a day
[1:17:29.320 --> 1:17:34.000]  visit with us Ted just two weeks ago you were selling gold you bought in the
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:37.520]  market a thousand dollars an ounce when it was over a thousand one hundred you
[1:17:37.520 --> 1:17:42.080]  still got a little bit of gold at the thousand fifty level passing on a hundred
[1:17:42.080 --> 1:17:47.000]  plus dollar savings to people most gold companies have huge premiums or can't
[1:17:47.000 --> 1:17:51.640]  even get it right now you've been in the business 30 years so you do have it
[1:17:51.640 --> 1:17:57.760]  briefly just cut and dry tell people today's Midas resources offer and how
[1:17:57.760 --> 1:18:01.640]  long gold that you bought at the thousand fifty level passing on those
[1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:08.440]  savings with a thousand one hundred and seventy four right now tell folks what
[1:18:08.440 --> 1:18:12.800]  you've got and how long this is gonna last well how long it's gonna last is
[1:18:12.800 --> 1:18:16.600]  gonna be the million dollar question we have right now I mean just today Alex
[1:18:16.600 --> 1:18:22.080]  gold dropped down to 1,155 for maybe two minutes before it jumped right back up
[1:18:22.080 --> 1:18:26.800]  to 1,171 and that's manipulation on record so there their manipulation is
[1:18:26.800 --> 1:18:30.400]  now failing it is I mean there's no question about it right now what we
[1:18:30.400 --> 1:18:35.240]  have I am still holding the prices from yesterday and even a week ago right now
[1:18:35.240 --> 1:18:40.400]  we have British sovereigns currently at 325 I have the Franks at two hundred and
[1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:45.400]  sixty three dollars the walking liberties are still at 869 the Lakota's are
[1:18:45.400 --> 1:18:50.680]  twenty two dollars forty four cents I have a new coin though the Montana
[1:18:50.680 --> 1:18:55.120]  citizens decided that they're that they petitioned their government for gold and
[1:18:55.120 --> 1:18:59.480]  silver-backed money the government shut them out so they decided to start
[1:18:59.480 --> 1:19:03.280]  producing their own coins and I have it right here it's called the Montana
[1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:07.880]  Silver Reserve coin and it is gorgeous and I would highly recommend that people
[1:19:07.880 --> 1:19:12.560]  get involved with those because you're gonna support that Montana movement and
[1:19:12.560 --> 1:19:15.640]  I think that that's a word and Montana saying they're gonna manufacture guns
[1:19:15.640 --> 1:19:18.800]  without the federal government's approval under the 10th Amendment eight

[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:19.720]  Ted Anderson what is your take on these hacked climate documents and now even
[1:26:19.720 --> 1:26:25.400]  the computer code has notes to the any computer people looking at it that work
[1:26:25.400 --> 1:26:30.040]  for the universities in the UN on how the fraud works and how they skew the
[1:26:30.040 --> 1:26:33.480]  numbers just like when they caught Daibold and others with their internal
[1:26:33.480 --> 1:26:38.280]  code how it was designed to rig elections I mean we have them triple
[1:26:38.280 --> 1:26:44.040]  red-handed at every level caught engaging in this Ted Anderson well I mean
[1:26:44.040 --> 1:26:49.920]  my I can give you my opinion I mean global warming is a complete hoax it has
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:54.280]  nothing to do with climate change at all it has everything to do about
[1:26:54.280 --> 1:27:00.560]  centralized power bringing power to a one-world order but in order to have that
[1:27:00.560 --> 1:27:05.720]  you have to be able to tax the world so all of the governments that are
[1:27:05.720 --> 1:27:09.600]  currently right now taxing their citizens are gonna have to turn over their
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:13.920]  power to the central location and divert taxes to that so they can that's
[1:27:13.920 --> 1:27:18.480]  what the UN is now in the EU are openly saying the UN will run everything with
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:22.720]  global police powers with thousands not hundreds thousands of new taxes on
[1:27:22.720 --> 1:27:26.520]  everything we already see multiple states in the US passing these type of
[1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:31.760]  laws banning TVs above 40 inches taxing all the others in California this is
[1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:37.080]  all happening right now ladies and gentlemen and how would they sell the
[1:27:37.080 --> 1:27:41.640]  world on accepting global taxes on all human activities they would do it by
[1:27:41.640 --> 1:27:46.360]  saying you're going to die if you don't oh Al Gore is the savior of the planet oh
[1:27:46.360 --> 1:27:50.520]  he's gonna make billions of dollars himself off of it isn't he sweet isn't
[1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:54.640]  he darling and their brainwashing children in public schools shifting back
[1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:57.560]  to gold her in the last minute or two in this short segment and our big guess is
[1:27:57.560 --> 1:28:02.920]  coming up Ted one more time in layman's terms explain to people the gold and
[1:28:02.920 --> 1:28:06.960]  silver offers you have and how you went into the market and bought it when it
[1:28:06.960 --> 1:28:11.400]  was lower but you're not raising prices like most brokers do you are keeping it
[1:28:11.400 --> 1:28:15.600]  at the older lower price this is like getting in a time machine going back in
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:19.040]  time and being able to buy gold and silver when it was lower than it is now
[1:28:19.040 --> 1:28:24.200]  well remember remember gold may surge to 1,500 an ounce over the next 18 months
[1:28:24.200 --> 1:28:27.720]  Bank of America and Merrill Lynch analysts said today in a report that's
[1:28:27.720 --> 1:28:32.600]  from Bloomberg today go ahead yeah and well eight and sisters are saying the
[1:28:32.600 --> 1:28:37.120]  same thing over 1200 and they've been right on for years as well you know what
[1:28:37.120 --> 1:28:41.800]  well all I do Alex is I look for the dips and I buy some quantities I put it
[1:28:41.800 --> 1:28:46.720]  into my safe and I hold on to it market runs up I just don't increase the
[1:28:46.720 --> 1:28:50.720]  prices I sell it for what I have it for and that's the thing that I do that's
[1:28:50.720 --> 1:28:54.240]  perhaps different than other dealers I don't know why they don't do it but
[1:28:54.240 --> 1:28:58.360]  people need to take advantage of the offers for gold and silver because the
[1:28:58.360 --> 1:29:02.760]  currency that you're holding on to is losing value way too fast and it's way
[1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:07.720]  too dangerous for you to stay in cash that's the bottom line and if I can
[1:29:07.720 --> 1:29:11.520]  influence your thoughts a little bit more to get involved in gold and silver
[1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:16.360]  by holding my prices down and getting in I don't know I think it's a good idea
[1:29:16.360 --> 1:29:20.640]  it's more important that people have gold and silver in their hand and you
[1:29:20.640 --> 1:29:24.320]  know just about any other thing that you can think you're an Uber capitalist you
[1:29:24.320 --> 1:29:29.320]  love being so successful and competing in the market and defeating your
[1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:37.160]  competition 800 686 2237 the brokers are there right now 800 686 2237 take
[1:29:37.160 --> 1:29:40.880]  advantage of this you keep seeing the price go up in the next few days Ted's
[1:29:40.880 --> 1:29:44.880]  gonna say sorry I ran out the lower price it's now more but his new price will
[1:29:44.880 --> 1:29:50.120]  still be lower than where gold goes it's only going up up in a way 800 686 2237

[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:34.720]  others members of parliament in England break down sir what we're dealing with
[1:34:34.720 --> 1:34:38.160]  here good to have you with us thank you Alex thank you for having me on well
[1:34:38.160 --> 1:34:43.400]  first of all I've seen this before I covered and did an Amazon rainforest
[1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:47.640]  that's documentary in 2000 and the gist of that documentary was that the
[1:34:47.640 --> 1:34:51.800]  Amazon rainforest here was not only vastly overblown but without scientific
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:54.320]  foundation the idea of a rainforest where all this appearing there were
[1:34:54.320 --> 1:34:58.880]  predictions of rain Amazon will be gone by the year 2000 fast forward to
[1:34:58.880 --> 1:35:03.040]  January of this year the New York Times openly admitting that for every acre of
[1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:07.200]  rainforest cut 50 are growing back quoting scientists saying maybe it wasn't
[1:35:07.200 --> 1:35:10.480]  such an urgent cause after all they're calling it the galloping jungle as
[1:35:10.480 --> 1:35:14.880]  people leave the rainforest to go live in cities the force of reverting the
[1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:19.360]  nature guess what canceled the eco scare and that was the eco scared the
[1:35:19.360 --> 1:35:23.240]  shore of the 70s out of the late 70s into the 80s particularly in the early
[1:35:23.240 --> 1:35:26.560]  90s there were stings rainforest concerts and now it looks like we're
[1:35:26.560 --> 1:35:29.960]  coming to this to the be at least the beginning of the end or the rapid
[1:35:29.960 --> 1:35:35.120]  disintegration of the man-made global warming fears the bottom line is this
[1:35:35.120 --> 1:35:40.000]  is the upper echelon of United Nations scientist Kevin Trenbeth there he leads
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:44.640]  on and lead author Michael Mann inventor of the hockey stick temperature graph
[1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:49.000]  reportedly shown the 20th century unprecedented Phil Jones the head of
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:54.240]  the center in Europe and in England who's also a top UN scientist these were
[1:35:54.240 --> 1:35:58.800]  the top men conspiring caught if they say caught on tape caught on email and
[1:35:58.800 --> 1:36:03.400]  caught in documents and what they're talking about is hiding with a client
[1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:07.640]  and temperatures they're talking about how they openly admitting that they
[1:36:07.640 --> 1:36:10.440]  don't understand the natural variability in nature and things like geo
[1:36:10.440 --> 1:36:14.320]  engineering would have no impact because quote we can't account for what's
[1:36:14.320 --> 1:36:18.200]  happening in the climate system unquote and they go on and they talk about
[1:36:18.200 --> 1:36:22.840]  conspiring to keep fellow scientists who are skeptical and or inconvenient data
[1:36:22.840 --> 1:36:26.640]  at a peer-reviewed journal they openly talk about how they're going to conspire
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:32.240]  there is to keep out studies that are inconvenient in the UN process this is
[1:36:32.240 --> 1:36:36.680]  the UN panel that won a Nobel Prize and shared it with Al Gore and that in
[1:36:36.680 --> 1:36:41.600]  2007 people are already starting to chant take it back take it back this
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:46.680]  group and through these emails it is exposing that essentially they were
[1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:52.000]  nothing more than environmental partisan trying to fulfill a grand narrative
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:56.120]  of dangerous man-made local warming and they were going to make it happen this
[1:36:56.120 --> 1:37:01.320]  is manufactured science at its best it's the best science that means that we can
[1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:06.520]  manufacture and the United Nations was manufacturing it this blaze waste to the
[1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:11.040]  notion peddled by the media and Al Gore that there's a consensus of scientists if
[1:37:11.040 --> 1:37:14.520]  you look at these emails all they're doing is fretting about all the skeptics
[1:37:14.520 --> 1:37:17.600]  about all the critiques about all the mistakes they're making and how to spin
[1:37:17.600 --> 1:37:21.400]  them how to cover them up how to destroy speed of information documents this is
[1:37:21.400 --> 1:37:26.080]  not a pretty picture but shockingly in the most shocking point I'm sorry to
[1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:30.040]  fill about there Alex I did work in the Senate so if you want to do it we love
[1:37:30.040 --> 1:37:38.920]  you okay what the most shocking you know but the most shocking angle of all
[1:37:38.920 --> 1:37:44.200]  this is before this came out last week this movement was already on its death
[1:37:44.200 --> 1:37:47.800]  bed and what do I mean by that here's what I mean peer-reviewed studies
[1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:52.640]  showing at least three decades more of cooling or no warming UN scientists in
[1:37:52.640 --> 1:37:57.080]  September warning UN meetings of the potential for decades of global cooling
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:38:02.240]  ahead we had other peer-reviewed studies showing the future enforcing no
[1:38:02.240 --> 1:38:05.920]  we're near what the UN has said multiple peer-reviewed studies kept coming out
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:10.640]  more and more scientists were defending the ultimate pinnacle of the collapse of
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:14.680]  man-made global warming there was when president Barack Obama announced that
[1:38:14.680 --> 1:38:19.440]  nothing was going to happen at this UN conference this prompted European rescue
[1:38:19.440 --> 1:38:25.200]  socialists in the in Berspiegel and other places to attack Obama as the next
[1:38:25.200 --> 1:38:31.120]  George W. Bush not only that in the U.S. global warming was so bad in such a
[1:38:31.120 --> 1:38:36.120]  moribund state that Senator Al Franken was bailing out of the climate bill it
[1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:41.680]  was so bad that former John McCain aid were stunned and it's about space on
[1:38:41.680 --> 1:38:45.280]  global warming despite having sponsored to global warming let me ask you this
[1:38:45.280 --> 1:38:50.600]  though are we going to see newt genrich and these other people that call
[1:38:50.600 --> 1:38:53.680]  themselves republicans but a really globalist are we going to see newt
[1:38:53.680 --> 1:38:57.360]  genrich who's always pushing man-made climate changing global tax are we
[1:38:57.360 --> 1:39:01.800]  going to see him apologize like George mom the odd the socialist is done now
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:06.400]  saying we've got a look at the evidence well very good point I don't know about
[1:39:06.400 --> 1:39:10.360]  the rich yet but I will tell you this Charlie Chris the governor Florida the
[1:39:10.360 --> 1:39:14.680]  Republican Al Gore used to appear with Cheryl Crowe is now running for global
[1:39:14.680 --> 1:39:18.960]  warming he now says cap and trade is attacked he is backing away most
[1:39:18.960 --> 1:39:23.000]  shockingly to plenty who would actually wrap himself in the mantle of the
[1:39:23.000 --> 1:39:27.120]  politically correct global warming cause for Republican is now questioning the
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:31.000]  scientific being attacked by the same people he made friends with he is now
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:35.200]  a skeptic almost all of the Minnesota governor care is the GOP skeptic the
[1:39:35.200 --> 1:39:39.160]  global warming almost all the Illinois Canada skeptic the global warming this
[1:39:39.160 --> 1:39:45.080]  is a key change and you know why the public tea party and the town hall more
[1:39:45.080 --> 1:39:50.000]  as of late October more Americans believe in haunted houses than man-made
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:54.280]  global warming oh mark that mark that's another point I wanted to go over a few
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:58.240]  of the frauds Al Gore put out the fake graph as you know in a documented he's
[1:39:58.240 --> 1:40:01.800]  now had to remove it showing carbon dioxide rising with temperature when
[1:40:01.800 --> 1:40:05.920]  it actually follows hundreds of years after that's official ice core all the
[1:40:05.920 --> 1:40:11.080]  major universities they've been caught lying they've been but I want you to
[1:40:11.080 --> 1:40:16.080]  cover that but also they've been caught lying and saying all scientists agree the
[1:40:16.080 --> 1:40:21.560]  science is in no one disagrees that hoax has imploded didn't this really start
[1:40:21.560 --> 1:40:25.920]  backfiring on them the last few years because their lies only got bigger and
[1:40:25.920 --> 1:40:30.880]  more arrogant and more ridiculous and they started calling Al Gore a prophet
[1:40:30.880 --> 1:40:35.200]  well yes that was open at Oprah Winfrey called them the know of our time well
[1:40:35.200 --> 1:40:39.120]  here's the deal out that we do set the lies that's already here those here's a
[1:40:39.120 --> 1:40:44.200]  comment Pat answer Al Gore likes to say the same people who deny the you know
[1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:47.160]  man-made global warming are the same people who think the moon landing was
[1:40:47.160 --> 1:40:51.560]  staged in a movie lot oh really mr. vice president how come two of the moon
[1:40:51.560 --> 1:40:56.760]  walkers themselves Jack Smith and the buzz Aldrin have come out as huge
[1:40:56.760 --> 1:41:01.600]  global warming skeptics don't even check their their throwaway talking points at
[1:41:01.600 --> 1:41:06.840]  this point it's so bad and by the way we've had both of them on here repeating
[1:41:06.840 --> 1:41:11.520]  what you just said but go ahead well almost every point from Al Gore's film
[1:41:11.520 --> 1:41:17.320]  from the high point of global warming hysteria in 2006 had been mockingly a
[1:41:17.320 --> 1:41:21.520]  cool joke on Al Gore whether it's not killing Jara which he did which he tried
[1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:25.160]  to highlight is not being reduced because of global warming it's because of
[1:41:25.160 --> 1:41:29.200]  before station at the base he talked about rising sea level guess what one
[1:41:29.200 --> 1:41:33.000]  scientist put it the best if sea level is rising due to global warming no one
[1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:39.960]  told sea level and no acceleration of sea level from A to B the Arctic has
[1:41:39.960 --> 1:41:45.120]  gained in the summer the size of one and a half Texas is since 2007 the Antarctic
[1:41:45.120 --> 1:41:48.920]  had the record sea ice extent for the summer that they've ever had to
[1:41:48.920 --> 1:41:53.960]  satellite monitoring one more in the morning Greenland has cooled since
[1:41:53.960 --> 1:41:59.320]  1940 what asked before the after 80% of CO2 went in the atmosphere on almost
[1:41:59.320 --> 1:42:03.160]  every point you can mention Al Gore claims with more tornadoes guess what
[1:42:03.160 --> 1:42:06.760]  there are small more smaller tornadoes are detected but because we have
[1:42:06.760 --> 1:42:12.200]  software and radar we didn't have 10 20 30 years ago everything he said is now
[1:42:12.200 --> 1:42:17.120]  being turned into a cool joke on him okay now the public gets it world leaders
[1:42:17.120 --> 1:42:21.200]  are getting it and now finally the UN is being exposed to what's going on
[1:42:21.200 --> 1:42:25.280]  behind the scenes there's a bunch of partisan activists trying to manufacture
[1:42:25.280 --> 1:42:28.720]  science okay you're right at the heart of the fight against this so I want to
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:33.160]  pick your brain here with some quick important questions we know that they
[1:42:33.160 --> 1:42:38.640]  said global cooling in the 60s a global tax was needed and then when that didn't
[1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:43.320]  happen they said okay deforestation we need a global tax and when that didn't
[1:42:43.320 --> 1:42:47.240]  happen they said man may global warming when that didn't happen now they're
[1:42:47.240 --> 1:42:52.360]  calling it climate change the climate's always changing we have the seasons we
[1:42:52.360 --> 1:42:59.080]  have decade-long seasons not just yearly seasons so a what are they going to do
[1:42:59.080 --> 1:43:04.680]  now what's their new scam a so I want to cover that in a moment be they don't
[1:43:04.680 --> 1:43:09.040]  care if we prove the truth Schwarzenegger's banning and taxing TVs
[1:43:09.040 --> 1:43:13.240]  their brainwashing kids in every public school in the country they're
[1:43:13.240 --> 1:43:18.800]  teaching us about carbon credits the governments of the world don't care of
[1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:24.880]  it's a fraud so so so a what's going to be their new scam and be how do we get
[1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:28.840]  them out of the schools how do we stop their brainwashing how do we stop the
[1:43:28.840 --> 1:43:34.120]  cult in Al Gore's own words this new religion of world government worshipping
[1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:39.520]  from taking over well first of all I'm Schwarzenegger he is an embarrassment to
[1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:43.760]  science he actually came out in a radio address I believe it was last spring and
[1:43:43.760 --> 1:43:47.080]  told people they should hang their clothes the air dry to save energy the
[1:43:47.080 --> 1:43:50.320]  same Arnold Schwarzenegger who was commuting to work in the governor's
[1:43:50.320 --> 1:43:55.240]  office in a private jet at the Udacity to tell California's we're going to be
[1:43:55.240 --> 1:44:00.720]  imposing huge regressive energy taxes on through the man made global warming
[1:44:00.720 --> 1:44:04.320]  fairs that they should be air drying their clothes on the second point you
[1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:07.440]  mentioned global government people say well well you're a conspiracy that is
[1:44:07.440 --> 1:44:11.920]  no we use their own words Al Gore in July the US climate bill will lead to
[1:44:11.920 --> 1:44:15.800]  global governance former French president Josh Ross the Kyoto protocol
[1:44:15.800 --> 1:44:19.920]  on global warming the first step to an authentic global governance case dancing
[1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:24.000]  moon just said we have equitable global governance in the next climate bill those
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:28.120]  are their words their quote their exact words can it be worth the former
[1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:31.560]  Democrat senator from Colorado said events even if we're wrong on the
[1:44:31.560 --> 1:44:35.520]  science of global warming we're still doing right by policy it's never been
[1:44:35.520 --> 1:44:39.480]  about the science this is a manufactured issue all about politics and an
[1:44:39.480 --> 1:44:44.280]  ideology and environmental agenda your last year with the next eco scare in
[1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:47.720]  the first birthday they were fear the global pooling you had fear the role of
[1:44:47.720 --> 1:44:51.800]  population resource cares the famine the oceans turning into a black goo the
[1:44:51.800 --> 1:44:58.480]  Amazon rainforest disappearing well guess what right now people sense that
[1:44:58.480 --> 1:45:02.960]  this issue is flipping away from them in this year and last year the UK Green
[1:45:02.960 --> 1:45:07.560]  Party has come out and said the next week that the lack of oxygen maybe more
[1:45:07.560 --> 1:45:10.920]  there's a more serious threat than global warming in other words mankind is
[1:45:10.920 --> 1:45:14.720]  is causing the atmosphere oxygen to disappear from the atmosphere they're
[1:45:14.720 --> 1:45:19.360]  already test marketing the next eco scare more to the point Laurie David
[1:45:19.360 --> 1:45:23.240]  Al Gore's producer is also test marketing the next eco scare in the
[1:45:23.240 --> 1:45:27.160]  helping them post a couple months ago she wrote she was presenting information
[1:45:27.160 --> 1:45:31.560]  that plastic waste is now in some ways more alarming than man-made global
[1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:36.000]  warming they spent it they're afraid today and climate people on my website
[1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:40.480]  the head of the UN climate panel which end up a chart but by the way I debated
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:44.880]  at a UN conference in 2006 in Kenya and was so sure of himself that every
[1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:48.720]  scientist agreed with him he is now saying that sustainable living is a
[1:45:48.720 --> 1:45:53.560]  close larger problem than man-made global one let me stop you and now
[1:45:53.560 --> 1:45:58.160]  throwing global warming under the bus that's how bad it become let me throw
[1:45:58.160 --> 1:46:02.800]  this out you didn't mention because there's so many last week the new EU
[1:46:02.800 --> 1:46:07.120]  president Von Rompe and we have the clip in fact queued up we have time we'll
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:10.000]  see if you hold over one more second we probably have to go get that plane Von
[1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:16.720]  Rompe said the key to world government is the Copenhagen global tax to have
[1:46:16.720 --> 1:46:21.640]  global governance so they're admitting that the heart of their global
[1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:27.080]  government tax to these EU bureaucrats and to the Madoff's and to the Ken
[1:46:27.080 --> 1:46:32.120]  Lays and the Al Gore's and the George Soros's who all own the climate trading
[1:46:32.120 --> 1:46:37.080]  companies they're admitting that the heart of their takeover is this system
[1:46:37.080 --> 1:46:42.360]  and it's just amazing to see this happening and amazing to see this coming
[1:46:42.360 --> 1:46:46.600]  out in the open you say there's a route happening I agree as even the big
[1:46:46.600 --> 1:46:53.320]  socialist Mambia in England the big cause celeb socialist comes out and says
[1:46:53.320 --> 1:46:58.600]  okay we got a back away from this as it implodes shouldn't we see criminal
[1:46:58.600 --> 1:47:02.800]  investigations because this is a group trying to cut off resources trying to
[1:47:02.800 --> 1:47:06.800]  quote bankrupt the coal companies that would double power prices conservatively
[1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:10.800]  in the US as you know 51% of our power from coal this is a group that would
[1:47:10.800 --> 1:47:15.320]  impoverish and hurt our poorest people that it would destroy top scientists have
[1:47:15.320 --> 1:47:18.480]  said it would kill at least a billion people in the next decade the third
[1:47:18.480 --> 1:47:23.440]  world if this was implemented these are real numbers isn't this genocide we have
[1:47:23.440 --> 1:47:28.760]  John P. Holdren writing eco science the textbook calling for world population
[1:47:28.760 --> 1:47:33.800]  reduction one child policies a planetary regime to enforce it and now it's come
[1:47:33.800 --> 1:47:38.520]  out in the Canadian Free Press they read the emails John P. Holdren why how
[1:47:38.520 --> 1:47:45.560]  science are is in there saying ladies and gentlemen that they need to basically
[1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:50.360]  persecute and make fun of people and to shut down debate so the White House
[1:47:50.360 --> 1:47:55.720]  science are is involved in this what's your take on that yes it's the same
[1:47:55.720 --> 1:48:01.800]  White House science are through in 1971 one of man-made global cooling John
[1:48:01.800 --> 1:48:05.920]  Holdren I mean it's amazing that these people get respect Obama has energy
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:10.840]  secretary to who actually says science is speaking in his air and it's the first
[1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:14.640]  time in human history that science tells them for certain what the future will be
[1:48:14.640 --> 1:48:18.400]  like a hundred years from now well mr. energy secretary to you should have a
[1:48:18.400 --> 1:48:23.080]  deck of tarot cards on a boardwalk dispensing such nonsense it does not
[1:48:23.080 --> 1:48:26.600]  surprise me at all that these are committed ideological believers in a
[1:48:26.600 --> 1:48:31.120]  political movement and just for your listeners think that this science I mean
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:34.480]  here's the rebrighted the father of climatology who just died last year with
[1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:38.440]  active to the day he died that you could go outside and fit and have the same
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:42.040]  effect as doubling CO2 in the atmosphere and what we're finding in the period
[1:48:42.040 --> 1:48:47.520]  studies in the real-world data analysis away from me from the the the hoisted
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:51.520]  world of the UN is that there are hundreds of factors influencing global
[1:48:51.520 --> 1:48:54.600]  climate everything from top of the earth access the clouds the volcanic
[1:48:54.600 --> 1:49:01.120]  eruption to a war zone methane ocean cycle the sun solar system that's just
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:04.560]  there it's a single trace essential gas the atmosphere that we failed from our
[1:49:04.560 --> 1:49:08.960]  mouth that's driving climate is now laughable and even in the scientific
[1:49:08.960 --> 1:49:14.240]  community with peer review studies showing that CO2 is one factor out of
[1:49:14.240 --> 1:49:18.120]  hundreds and that you can't even distinguish the impact of rising CO2
[1:49:18.120 --> 1:49:21.880]  from natural variability so the bottom line of these computer models that you'll
[1:49:21.880 --> 1:49:25.440]  hear about all this could happen this might happen I believe scientists
[1:49:25.440 --> 1:49:30.160]  reviewed this the premier forecasting expert Scott Armstrong and said these
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:35.120]  climate models use by the UN violate the basic principles of forecast but mark as
[1:49:35.120 --> 1:49:39.880]  you know as you know it's not just the internal emails saying persecute other
[1:49:39.880 --> 1:49:43.800]  scientists get their funding cut which is racketeering it's not just how they
[1:49:43.800 --> 1:49:46.560]  admit the emails they're manipulating the data in the world really getting
[1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:53.560]  colder now the actual code as has code messages to programmers saying here's how
[1:49:53.560 --> 1:49:58.600]  you cook the data the very code programmers have now gone in to the
[1:49:58.600 --> 1:50:05.160]  code that was leaked it's it's written for fraud they're caught red-handed what
[1:50:05.160 --> 1:50:08.440]  they're finding out this is a quote from our website that data handling at that
[1:50:08.440 --> 1:50:11.960]  with the you know that you and was relying on what's called completely out
[1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:15.800]  of control quote they fudge so much that nothing that came out at any
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:21.080]  believability they talked openly about using tricks and statistical things and
[1:50:21.080 --> 1:50:25.480]  manipulating data you know this is just beginning this is not this is the death
[1:50:25.480 --> 1:50:29.960]  of a thousand cuts this was a car this man made a warming that was already dead
[1:50:29.960 --> 1:50:33.960]  before this candle but there are other hoaxes they got away with will they get
[1:50:33.960 --> 1:50:37.720]  away with this hoax or will it finally fully bring them down
[1:50:37.720 --> 1:50:42.120]  it will not get away that I'll tell you what this is like the end of every Scooby-Doo episode after being
[1:50:42.120 --> 1:50:46.560]  needlessly scared by ghost and goblin they pull the mask off they pull through
[1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:50.160]  the man behind the curtain was and he always inevitably says I would have got
[1:50:50.160 --> 1:50:53.720]  away with it without you meddling kids well the UN is probably saying right now
[1:50:53.720 --> 1:50:57.880]  we would have got away with it without those meddling skeptics mark stay there
[1:50:57.880 --> 1:51:00.520]  I want to say something during the break stay there we'll be right back
[1:51:00.520 --> 1:51:04.800]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[1:51:04.800 --> 1:51:08.760]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that
[1:51:08.760 --> 1:51:12.360]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:16.160]  gold it's true seeds about perform even gold and silver before in this country
[1:51:16.160 --> 1:51:20.080]  and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from
[1:51:20.080 --> 1:51:24.640]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a
[1:51:24.640 --> 1:51:29.520]  survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[1:51:29.520 --> 1:51:33.080]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been
[1:51:33.080 --> 1:51:36.880]  genetically modified in any way you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[1:51:36.880 --> 1:51:42.080]  full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank dot com that

[1:54:10.600 --> 1:54:15.280]  with us for the last five minutes of this segment climate depot.com is what he
[1:54:15.280 --> 1:54:19.960]  runs I wanted to talk to him about Lord Mockden saying prosecute the climate
[1:54:19.960 --> 1:54:24.200]  criminals Senator Inhofe who he worked for calling for an investigation but how
[1:54:24.200 --> 1:54:28.560]  do we get an investigation of the same people that run the system but first
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:33.880]  here is Von Rumpi the new head of the empowered EU calling for global
[1:54:33.880 --> 1:54:41.480]  governance through the Copenhagen tax here it is 2009 is also the first year
[1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:45.320]  of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle
[1:54:45.320 --> 1:54:51.800]  of the financial crisis the climate conference in Copenhagen is another step
[1:54:51.800 --> 1:54:58.640]  towards the global management of our planet our mission okay our president
[1:54:58.640 --> 1:55:02.320]  the global management of our planet through the Copenhagen Treaty global
[1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:06.760]  government I mean Mark we're frothing here we're frothing because we're
[1:55:06.760 --> 1:55:11.240]  talking about a level of control or well didn't contemplate and here's how German
[1:55:11.240 --> 1:55:15.000]  climate advisors proposing a CO2 budget for every man woman and child on the
[1:55:15.000 --> 1:55:19.760]  planet international organization i.e. global governance would monitor every
[1:55:19.760 --> 1:55:24.560]  individual on the planet this is why Nancy Pelosi went to China and said we
[1:55:24.560 --> 1:55:28.160]  need a complete inventory on every aspect of our lives this is what's in their
[1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:31.160]  mind this is the end game it's about arrogant
[1:55:31.160 --> 1:55:36.160]  being counter social engineers in Washington and in Brussels trying to
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:40.680]  engineer human behavior this is why Valkyrie Clauses said what he called
[1:55:40.680 --> 1:55:43.680]  ambitious environmentalism is the greatest threat that human freedom is
[1:55:43.680 --> 1:55:48.040]  the fall of communism and if you talk about UK's got the same thing CO2
[1:55:48.040 --> 1:55:52.120]  ration card where the government's going to monitor your your car travel your
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:56.640]  energy bill your airline travel your thermostat in your home this is again
[1:55:56.640 --> 1:56:01.040]  Oregon wants you much but this is a big issue taxes everyone used to paying
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:06.040]  they're not used to having the ultimate eco nanny state unbelievable I mean it's
[1:56:06.040 --> 1:56:11.120]  so over the top that they're this criminal their liars consciously they're
[1:56:11.120 --> 1:56:17.080]  nothing but piratical thieves in closing what do you think about the criminal
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:22.720]  investigations being called for by Lord Moncton and many others what is one one
[1:56:22.720 --> 1:56:26.920]  note everything I just told you almost direct quote in exact policies of what
[1:56:26.920 --> 1:56:30.280]  they're prescribing it's not my interpretation this is what people don't
[1:56:30.280 --> 1:56:33.440]  believe you when you tell them to stop I go to clarity but I have all this stuff
[1:56:33.440 --> 1:56:40.400]  in chapter we must stop them yes it's all true we must stop the nation set it
[1:56:40.400 --> 1:56:44.920]  in off to write what I had the pleasure to work for he in 2003 being a chairman
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:48.360]  of the environment committee he came out against this he went after the United
[1:56:48.360 --> 1:56:52.600]  Nations and went through all the obvious problems they had in terms of that and
[1:56:52.600 --> 1:56:57.080]  he knew it was a political the name is called the intergovernmental panel anyone
[1:56:57.080 --> 1:57:01.240]  who doesn't think it's political has no clue about the English language or work
[1:57:01.240 --> 1:57:05.400]  they give it away right there in office calling for an investigation into the
[1:57:05.400 --> 1:57:09.240]  Senate the House members come out this morning and call for an investigation in
[1:57:09.240 --> 1:57:13.720]  the UK a former Chancellor Lord Lawson is calling for an investigation Lord
[1:57:13.720 --> 1:57:17.080]  Moncton the former advisor to Margaret Thatcher is now calling for an
[1:57:17.080 --> 1:57:22.640]  investigation we have open comparison to Bernie made off there in terms of Lord
[1:57:22.640 --> 1:57:27.360]  Moncton he's actually said bluntly they are criminals and he said fraud is what
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:31.760]  we know it to be this is what's happening around the world and guess what
[1:57:31.760 --> 1:57:38.160]  to my knowledge ABC NBC CBS news this is not even a story no this just wrote
[1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:44.960]  mark mark this just broke BBC was sent these emails five weeks before and
[1:57:44.960 --> 1:57:49.440]  refused to cover them the hackers sent it to them first and they covered up
[1:57:49.440 --> 1:57:54.480]  evidence of a crime we cover it all in my film fall the Republic on DVD and
[1:57:54.480 --> 1:57:58.760]  info wars dot-com the entire climate scam go to climate depot dot-com to find
[1:57:58.760 --> 1:58:04.840]  out more info wars dot-com prison planet dot-com do you expect this to result in
[1:58:04.840 --> 1:58:09.640]  criminal investigations well here's the deal whoever did this it sounds like they
[1:58:09.640 --> 1:58:14.140]  broke the law they should face criminal investigation any any no I mean criminal
[1:58:14.140 --> 1:58:16.960]  investigation of Al Gore and these people
[1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:20.560]  Robert that the president released it should face whatever need they need to
[1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:24.400]  at the same time we should then have a separate case parade for them in New York
[1:58:24.400 --> 1:58:29.640]  City what they did in the service of science by exposing it the emperor has
[1:58:29.640 --> 1:58:35.640]  no clothes and Al Gore in the United Nations now will forever more be painted
[1:58:35.640 --> 1:58:43.560]  harness and now we know what they say behind the scenes thank you for listening

[1:59:02.320 --> 1:59:07.480]  vaccination avoidance instead use vitamin cd and oxy silver along with zeolife
[1:59:07.480 --> 1:59:12.360]  for broad spectrum detoxification using NASA science oxy silver is nano silver

[2:00:04.720 --> 2:00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[2:00:12.480 --> 2:00:19.960]  he he's alex jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:29.600]  alex jones mark and I were just ranting and frothing because I know the feeling
[2:00:29.600 --> 2:00:33.440]  there's so much documentation so much evidence of fraud so much proof you're
[2:00:33.440 --> 2:00:38.040]  like look look and then now we have their own emails where the top scientists for
[2:00:38.040 --> 2:00:42.880]  the UN are talking to the top scientists in the US and Europe about how to lie
[2:00:42.880 --> 2:00:48.560]  and how to persecute scientists and how to fix the data and in these documents
[2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:52.760]  that were released are the computer code of the weather models with the computer
[2:00:52.760 --> 2:00:56.800]  programmers explaining to people that may be working on it later look this
[2:00:56.800 --> 2:01:01.440]  whole thing's a fraud you got to run all sorts of scams to flip the data we have
[2:01:01.440 --> 2:01:04.640]  videos of the code where it's all described by computer programmers online
[2:01:04.640 --> 2:01:10.800]  with the emails with the code I mean this whole thing is red-handed it's like
[2:01:10.800 --> 2:01:19.160]  catching a killer it's like a murderer shooting somebody at a sports stadium in
[2:01:19.160 --> 2:01:24.120]  front of a hundred thousand people I mean they have been caught it'd be like
[2:01:24.120 --> 2:01:29.240]  if a husband choked his wife to death on national television there's no doubt he
[2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:33.200]  did it there's no doubt they're caught and Tim ball who by the way is in my
[2:01:33.200 --> 2:01:38.440]  film fall the Republic did an incredible job as a top climatologist early on
[2:01:38.440 --> 2:01:42.280]  didn't have a political axe got persecuted and they talk about how to
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:46.440]  persecute people they talk about him bad in the emails I forgot to tell you they
[2:01:46.440 --> 2:01:53.040]  talk about Mark who we had on last hour with his four year request trying to get
[2:01:53.040 --> 2:01:57.720]  the documents how to block those documents I mean this is incredible and
[2:01:57.720 --> 2:02:03.280]  Dr. Tim ball is now on with us for the rest of the hour we're extremely honored
[2:02:03.280 --> 2:02:06.800]  to have him we're going to break here in just a moment but but doctor how
[2:02:06.800 --> 2:02:13.720]  exciting was this you're like Galileo saying that the earth orbits the Sun
[2:02:13.720 --> 2:02:18.800]  not the Sun orbiting the earth and now you've been proven right and that it's
[2:02:18.800 --> 2:02:22.840]  premeditated fraud they weren't just wrong they and you said that all along
[2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:26.840]  because all the other scientists like yourself would do the raw research and
[2:02:26.840 --> 2:02:30.640]  say it doesn't add up and they'd say shut up I mean what is this like for you
[2:02:30.640 --> 2:02:36.440]  after all the persecution you've been through it's a very sad day Alex because
[2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:41.480]  it's a sad day for science it's a sad day for the environment which we need to
[2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:45.360]  care about people will start to say now we don't believe anything you tell us
[2:02:45.360 --> 2:02:53.160]  and they have destroyed climate science virtually and as I've said elsewhere
[2:02:53.160 --> 2:02:59.920]  there is no pleasure and I told you so but what we've got to do now is hold
[2:02:59.920 --> 2:03:06.960]  people responsible and to to backtrack on all of the incredibly damaging
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:13.440]  legislation that's been brought in or proposed on a global scale in both in
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:21.000]  energy and economies based upon this false data that's why we've got you here
[2:03:21.000 --> 2:03:25.840]  today to not just talk about their fraud but you you told my producer this is
[2:03:25.840 --> 2:03:30.960]  only the tip of the iceberg I want to go over that but also talk about what do
[2:03:30.960 --> 2:03:35.560]  we do now we have to bring these criminals to justice they're openly
[2:03:35.560 --> 2:03:39.600]  setting up a tyrannical world government to micromanage every facet of our
[2:03:39.600 --> 2:03:44.120]  lives all these top demographers and researchers have said a billion people
[2:03:44.120 --> 2:03:49.880]  will die within a decade worldwide if they implemented these carbon rationing
[2:03:49.880 --> 2:03:55.880]  energy rationing plans it will destroy our economy shouldn't they be held
[2:03:55.880 --> 2:04:00.640]  criminally responsible as Lord Mockden is saying well absolutely the only
[2:04:00.640 --> 2:04:06.160]  difficulty will be of course that if it's in a UK court it depends on how the
[2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:12.760]  information was obtained if it was if it was a whistleblower that is eligible
[2:04:12.760 --> 2:04:18.200]  in a British court but if it was hacked that would be deemed inadmissible so
[2:04:18.200 --> 2:04:22.880]  all of this evidence would not be entertained and of course we would then
[2:04:22.880 --> 2:04:28.040]  be in the same position as I've been in all these years that I could I could see
[2:04:28.040 --> 2:04:32.840]  what was going on I knew what was going on but I didn't have that smoking gun
[2:04:32.840 --> 2:04:38.800]  stay there not only got a smoking gun but we got an atomic bomb here I agree
[2:04:38.800 --> 2:04:43.680]  that's how I likened it to as an ICBM of truth yesterday yeah but the issue is
[2:04:43.680 --> 2:04:47.760]  they screwed up and admitted it was their emails to the Associated Press they
[2:04:47.760 --> 2:04:50.760]  said yeah those are our emails yeah and they said oh but they're taking out a
[2:04:50.760 --> 2:04:54.400]  context so they should still be admissible the police need to raid
[2:04:54.400 --> 2:04:58.320]  those facilities and get the actual hard drives we know that'll be admissible
[2:04:58.320 --> 2:05:01.600]  but you know they're in there erasing it all right now have you ever wanted to
[2:05:01.600 --> 2:05:05.680]  generate your own supply of electrical power if so this is going to be the most
[2:05:05.680 --> 2:05:09.520]  important message you will ever hear solar power generators are now available
[2:05:09.520 --> 2:05:13.600]  from solutions from science in Thompson Illinois these emergency backup systems
[2:05:13.600 --> 2:05:17.960]  provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas generators a
[2:05:17.960 --> 2:05:22.480]  solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and produces electricity for free
[2:05:22.480 --> 2:05:26.600]  it's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home run
[2:05:26.600 --> 2:05:31.440]  some pumps shortwave radios computers and even keep food from spoiling whether
[2:05:31.440 --> 2:05:35.800]  it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to suffer
[2:05:35.800 --> 2:05:39.680]  through painful power outages again when the power goes out you'll be ready
[2:05:39.680 --> 2:05:44.960]  with a solar power generator from solution from science go to my solar

[2:08:06.040 --> 2:08:12.560]  because there's a war on for your mind I'm gonna try to contain myself because
[2:08:12.560 --> 2:08:16.960]  there's so many facets of this fraud and then how the establishment is calling
[2:08:16.960 --> 2:08:21.440]  themselves victims they're now seeing in the Guardian that that the climate
[2:08:21.440 --> 2:08:24.520]  skeptics with these emails are persecuting good scientists when they're
[2:08:24.520 --> 2:08:27.960]  in their own emails talking about how they were persecuting people with
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:32.040]  government power how they were blocking for your request how they were
[2:08:32.040 --> 2:08:36.920]  destroying scientific debate in blockating people publishing their
[2:08:36.920 --> 2:08:41.320]  science I mean this is a rigged club of crooks and we're gonna talk about
[2:08:41.320 --> 2:08:45.320]  bringing them to criminal justice also researched by dr. Tim ball in these
[2:08:45.320 --> 2:08:52.200]  emails John P. Holdren the eugenicist is all over these emails helping coordinate
[2:08:52.200 --> 2:08:59.680]  things this is huge okay dr. Tim ball you've got the moment was a few years
[2:08:59.680 --> 2:09:05.960]  ago there were two in fact they're both still active Willie soon and Sally
[2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:10.880]  Balliunas both at Harvard and they were doing first-class research they're both
[2:09:10.880 --> 2:09:15.400]  solar physicists and they were doing first-class research now the key thing
[2:09:15.400 --> 2:09:19.600]  was the medieval war period and they had to get rid of that because they were
[2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:23.680]  saying that the 20th century was warmest ever when in fact just a thousand
[2:09:23.680 --> 2:09:28.720]  years ago it was even warmer than now and soon and Balliunas had to extend
[2:09:28.720 --> 2:09:32.840]  the free search proving it and so of course they had to get rid of the medieval
[2:09:32.840 --> 2:09:36.000]  war period which they did through the hockey stick and Michael Mann and that
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:43.560]  scandal but they had to also denigrate soon and Balliunas and there's a series
[2:09:43.560 --> 2:09:48.600]  of emails in there which Michael Mann is sending to the the group the CRU
[2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:56.400]  gangsters from John Holdren and man says John thinks you'll be entertained by
[2:09:56.400 --> 2:10:02.120]  this this exercise and what it was was that Holdren have a series of breakfast
[2:10:02.120 --> 2:10:07.520]  meetings and and which he send out information ahead of time and they
[2:10:07.520 --> 2:10:13.960]  debated how long soon and Balliunas were and how right Michael Mann was and and
[2:10:13.960 --> 2:10:19.280]  of course Holdren using that that power that he had and by the way he was in the
[2:10:19.280 --> 2:10:24.880]  Teresa and Kerry Heinz and we know all about their connections that he was in
[2:10:24.880 --> 2:10:31.240]  that chair at Harvard and so Balliunas and it was about a few years ago she was
[2:10:31.240 --> 2:10:36.000]  on some of our advisory committees on the skeptic side and all of a sudden we
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:41.720]  didn't hear from her we finally contacted her and she said look basically I've
[2:10:41.720 --> 2:10:47.440]  been under attack here I've got to step aside and she also disclosed as some of
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:52.360]  the personal attacks as a woman and as a redhead that was just absolutely
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:56.680]  outrageous so this is going on with within within Harvard and of course
[2:10:56.680 --> 2:11:01.880]  Holdren is very very proud of what he let me stop you let me stop you give us
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:04.960]  details of what she told you because that's an article that needs to be
[2:11:04.960 --> 2:11:10.000]  written to show how they persecuted women and scientists and used intimidation
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:13.800]  because they talk about that in some of the other emails how to intimidate how
[2:11:13.800 --> 2:11:17.600]  to cut funding how to not let people publish their reports let's cover that
[2:11:17.600 --> 2:11:22.080]  in a moment but first let me ask you this question yeah over and over again
[2:11:22.080 --> 2:11:25.880]  they've been proven that they're lying they're more polar bears not less polar
[2:11:25.880 --> 2:11:29.400]  bears are the best swimmers they're not grounding they hunt on ice packs they're
[2:11:29.400 --> 2:11:33.960]  not drifting they're going to die they show school kids the Arctic and Antarctic
[2:11:33.960 --> 2:11:37.160]  contracting in the summer they don't explain that it gets big again in the
[2:11:37.160 --> 2:11:41.680]  winter they've been caught lying with the carbon dioxide heat graph having
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:45.320]  carbon dioxide coinciding with the heat not coming after it several hundred
[2:11:45.320 --> 2:11:49.960]  years as you know hundreds and hundreds of frauds they've been caught in but
[2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:55.760]  now that before they could deny they were caught or say it was an accident or have
[2:11:55.760 --> 2:12:00.600]  a debate about it now they've been caught red-handed in these emails at the
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:05.440]  top climate facility the UN sites as you know Dr. Balvin a top climatologist how
[2:12:05.440 --> 2:12:09.560]  big of an issue is it to have them red-handed in the code the computer
[2:12:09.560 --> 2:12:14.240]  code with notes on how they do the fraud and then having them in the emails how
[2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:18.440]  they know it's getting colder but they're going to lie I mean is this not the
[2:12:18.440 --> 2:12:23.800]  holy grail you called it an atomic weapon against their lies oh absolutely
[2:12:23.800 --> 2:12:28.720]  and of course it isn't just the people the CRU the climatic research unit and
[2:12:28.720 --> 2:12:34.640]  Phil Jones see now Phil Jones is the guy who put out that number that of
[2:12:34.640 --> 2:12:37.880]  temperature increase of one degree Fahrenheit which Gore talks about in his
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:42.920]  movie okay Jones has consistently refused to disclose how he produced that
[2:12:42.920 --> 2:12:47.680]  number or accused wrote to him from Australia the email and Jones came back
[2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:51.880]  and said we spent 25 years getting these numbers why should we share it with you
[2:12:51.880 --> 2:12:54.560]  when when all you want to do is find something wrong and you talk about that
[2:12:54.560 --> 2:12:58.880]  and follow the Republic before this even came out you pointed at Jones yeah
[2:12:58.880 --> 2:13:06.080]  exactly now but beyond that Jones man Ken Britha Keith Britha and by the way
[2:13:06.080 --> 2:13:11.040]  that the person that really started it all is Tom Wigley he's the M and Oscar
[2:13:11.040 --> 2:13:15.280]  he's behind all of this and I've watched him manipulate and control for 30 years
[2:13:15.280 --> 2:13:20.880]  and he started at the climatic research unit he's now an NCAR in Boulder and he's
[2:13:20.880 --> 2:13:24.760]  the grandfather he's the go-to guy when they say what should we do about this
[2:13:24.760 --> 2:13:28.640]  how should we deal about with this you can see that in the emails but more
[2:13:28.640 --> 2:13:34.840]  important to Alex is that these people control totally the IPCC and of course the
[2:13:34.840 --> 2:13:40.920]  IPCC is the authority that all world governments quote and go to is the basis
[2:13:40.920 --> 2:13:45.800]  of Kyoto it's the basis of the Copenhagen thing it's the it's the
[2:13:45.800 --> 2:13:51.440]  argument for carbon credits and that whole scam so it isn't just the
[2:13:51.440 --> 2:13:56.240]  scandals within that academic unit and I've said many times and I think I said
[2:13:56.240 --> 2:14:00.960]  it too when I was interviewed by your group that there's two responsibilities
[2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:05.040]  as a scientist you've got the responsibility in the laboratory these
[2:14:05.040 --> 2:14:10.320]  guys weren't even meeting those responsibilities as we now know but they
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:15.040]  but when you go public and say that your your science is legitimate and should be
[2:14:15.040 --> 2:14:19.720]  the basis of policy there's a whole new set of responsibilities kick in and they
[2:14:19.720 --> 2:14:24.000]  didn't meet those either in fact they deliberately thwarted them so it's on
[2:14:24.000 --> 2:14:27.680]  two completely different levels but the first thing that we got to do is we
[2:14:27.680 --> 2:14:35.560]  gotta shut down the IPCC it's got to go absolutely we have the top scientist
[2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:41.240]  interlaced with the UN climate study group and you also study them
[2:14:41.240 --> 2:14:45.040]  individually they're all globalists they're all pro-new world order they're
[2:14:45.040 --> 2:14:49.720]  all socialist they all want to cut human resources they all want one child
[2:14:49.720 --> 2:14:55.160]  policies this is a very sick group and studying them separate from the climate
[2:14:55.160 --> 2:14:59.440]  debate studying them being persecuted by them you're one of the first people they
[2:14:59.440 --> 2:15:03.320]  they singled out because as a top climatologist you were effectively
[2:15:03.320 --> 2:15:10.200]  countering them what type of individuals are these people well as you said and
[2:15:10.200 --> 2:15:15.160]  by the way the University of East Anglia where the CRU is located and I have the
[2:15:15.160 --> 2:15:20.560]  privilege of of dealing with the Hubert Lam is the father of climatology of the
[2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:25.760]  modern era I he helped me with my doctoral thesis he may be turning in his
[2:15:25.760 --> 2:15:31.160]  grave but the this this it was set up there at the University of East Anglia
[2:15:31.160 --> 2:15:36.440]  which by the way has been complicit in blocking freedom of information requests
[2:15:36.440 --> 2:15:40.920]  as has the United Kingdom that office so this thing permeates through government
[2:15:40.920 --> 2:15:45.760]  but the University of East Anglia was set up under the Harold Wilson socialist
[2:15:45.760 --> 2:15:50.040]  government in Britain and it is considered the the most left of all the
[2:15:50.040 --> 2:15:54.560]  left-wing universities in Britain so this was a perfect place for the CRU
[2:15:54.560 --> 2:16:00.800]  thing to fester into what it is become and of course the person that there's
[2:16:00.800 --> 2:16:05.040]  two sides to it of course there's the political side and the science side
[2:16:05.040 --> 2:16:10.520]  now the guy that brought put those two together is our old friend Morris Strong
[2:16:10.520 --> 2:16:15.680]  and of course Morris Strong I think is hiding out in China right now because the
[2:16:15.680 --> 2:16:19.360]  US government want him for his involvement with Kofi Annan in the oil
[2:16:19.360 --> 2:16:26.440]  for food in Iraq thing but Morris Strong was the one that set up the United
[2:16:26.440 --> 2:16:31.880]  Nations Environment Program and he made a statement 30 years ago that he said
[2:16:31.880 --> 2:16:35.840]  isn't the problem for the or the problem for the planet are the industrialized
[2:16:35.840 --> 2:16:40.600]  nations isn't it our responsibility to get rid of them and I want your audience
[2:16:40.600 --> 2:16:44.880]  to think about how would you do that if you consider the industrialized
[2:16:44.880 --> 2:16:49.080]  nations like an engine in a car and that's a very good analogy because
[2:16:49.080 --> 2:16:53.840]  fossil fuels and energy are critical to them how would you how would you go
[2:16:53.840 --> 2:16:58.080]  about doing that you say okay I can stop the engine by setting off the energy
[2:16:58.080 --> 2:17:03.800]  supply and as you see that happening and the impact on energy but but the
[2:17:03.800 --> 2:17:07.280]  public would screen right away we saw that with the when the fuel prices went
[2:17:07.280 --> 2:17:12.720]  up everybody's angry immediately so you you really can't do that but if you say
[2:17:12.720 --> 2:17:17.320]  look the byproduct the exhaust of this engine and you can stop an engine by
[2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:22.440]  plugging the exhaust so if you say look the exhaust of this industrialized
[2:17:22.440 --> 2:17:26.800]  nations or this car is CO2 and it's destroying the global climate and
[2:17:26.800 --> 2:17:32.520]  destroying the planet then you can point out oh this evil industry this horrible
[2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:39.200]  in industrial complex and this whole free market thing and we just got to shut
[2:17:39.200 --> 2:17:44.400]  it down it's destroying the planet that's why CO2 became the focus even
[2:17:44.400 --> 2:17:51.160]  though it's an absolute minuscule part of the total complexity that is
[2:17:51.160 --> 2:17:57.520]  weather and climate and and of course Morris Strong said about to do this now
[2:17:57.520 --> 2:18:03.040]  in a book called to the cloak of green by Elaine Dewar who by the way started to
[2:18:03.040 --> 2:18:07.760]  write a book praising all the environmentalists in Canada and as a good
[2:18:07.760 --> 2:18:10.840]  journalist the more she dug the more she discovered that these people were
[2:18:10.840 --> 2:18:17.240]  more corrupt than the corporations they were attacking and 20% of that book is
[2:18:17.240 --> 2:18:21.840]  devoted to strong and she said damn if you've got these ideas why don't you run
[2:18:21.840 --> 2:18:26.640]  for politics he probably the only honest statement in his life said well you
[2:18:26.640 --> 2:18:32.080]  can't do anything as a politician he said I'm going to go to the UN and there
[2:18:32.080 --> 2:18:36.720]  I can get all the money I want and not be accountable to anybody and that's
[2:18:36.720 --> 2:18:41.080]  precisely what he did he set up with Kofi Annan and he became the senior
[2:18:41.080 --> 2:18:46.520]  advisor and he set up the United Nations environment program and a subset of
[2:18:46.520 --> 2:18:50.440]  that was the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change now one of the things
[2:18:50.440 --> 2:18:55.760]  Alex said to help people understand how these sorts of machinations are done
[2:18:55.760 --> 2:19:00.680]  because strong was it incredibly I mean it's linked with Gore's movie you cannot
[2:19:00.680 --> 2:19:05.920]  deny it's a superb piece of propaganda and with Morris Strong you cannot deny
[2:19:05.920 --> 2:19:13.120]  his talents in persuading people and managing bureaucratic systems and one
[2:19:13.120 --> 2:19:16.960]  of the things through my own experience I've chaired many boards of commission
[2:19:16.960 --> 2:19:23.360]  and commissions of inquiry and it's a perfect vehicle for the politician
[2:19:23.360 --> 2:19:27.200]  because you know there's a there's a fight going on and the public are saying
[2:19:27.200 --> 2:19:31.600]  why don't you do something here well the politicians okay we'll say we'll have a
[2:19:31.600 --> 2:19:35.240]  commission inquiry and it'll be arms length and it was all good for you
[2:19:35.240 --> 2:19:40.080]  finally we're getting somewhere and but what they don't know is that the
[2:19:40.080 --> 2:19:45.440]  politicians can continue to retain control now first of all if the media
[2:19:45.440 --> 2:19:49.400]  come along well stay there stay there stay there obviously government funding
[2:19:49.400 --> 2:19:53.360]  over institutions they don't get the funding if they don't give the results
[2:19:53.360 --> 2:19:58.640]  that the UN wants well they're right back with climatologist Dr. Tim Ball this

[2:24:26.800 --> 2:24:31.400]  when you order one copy I just want to get this film out people are ready to
[2:24:31.400 --> 2:24:37.120]  hear this film is about the banks how the elites engineered the climate change
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:42.280]  fraud for the global tax and now we have Von Rumpi the head of the EU and saying
[2:24:42.280 --> 2:24:46.600]  this we have Al Gore another saying in the film everyone's got to see this say
[2:24:46.600 --> 2:24:50.040]  you want to know about the climate fraud what's really going on these are not
[2:24:50.040 --> 2:24:56.160]  scientists and the UN just screwing up on accident this is premeditated going
[2:24:56.160 --> 2:25:01.080]  back to Dr. Tim Ball this is a short segment sir I just want to stress that
[2:25:01.080 --> 2:25:04.040]  we can't let this go by the wayside they've been caught in so many other
[2:25:04.040 --> 2:25:08.360]  frauds but again they could say that was an accident this is red-handed and you
[2:25:08.360 --> 2:25:12.240]  were telling me during the break this goes the tentacles of this go into all
[2:25:12.240 --> 2:25:15.880]  of government and the entire power structure and they're not gonna quit
[2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:19.800]  just because this fraud came out unless we really get this message out that's
[2:25:19.800 --> 2:25:25.640]  what we're seeing a huge broadcast TV blackout on this oh absolutely as I
[2:25:25.640 --> 2:25:28.960]  said that topic bomb went off and most of the mainstream media didn't hear it
[2:25:28.960 --> 2:25:35.040]  but just a quick kudo to you Alex the YouTube nine minute video your grasp of
[2:25:35.040 --> 2:25:39.640]  off the issues in this is really remarkable and that's been one of the
[2:25:39.640 --> 2:25:44.600]  problems because most of the media are not scientists and one of the things
[2:25:44.600 --> 2:25:50.040]  with the the public is they're gonna have to need a lot of these emails explained
[2:25:50.040 --> 2:25:54.840]  what are they saying what's the context of this and of course it's why some of
[2:25:54.840 --> 2:25:59.160]  the attempts to block what's what's out there is saying oh they're taking it out
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:04.040]  of context and they can get away with that but the minute to somebody like
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:08.280]  myself that knows what's going on what should go on put it in context it just
[2:26:08.280 --> 2:26:13.400]  becomes even more explosive so yeah absolutely and by the way just back
[2:26:13.400 --> 2:26:18.880]  quickly I was talking about terms of reference in my own experience Mars
[2:26:18.880 --> 2:26:23.840]  Strong wrote the terms of reference for the IPCC and as I said when I chaired
[2:26:23.840 --> 2:26:27.960]  commissions of inquiry and your audience can think about the Kennedy
[2:26:27.960 --> 2:26:30.840]  Commission and they asked Judge Warren about well why didn't you look at the
[2:26:30.840 --> 2:26:34.640]  Matt mafia and Dallas connection on he said oh it wasn't in my terms of
[2:26:34.640 --> 2:26:39.640]  reference that's how the politicians control and the first commission I was
[2:26:39.640 --> 2:26:43.280]  given the minister gave me the terms of reference and I said mr. minister I
[2:26:43.280 --> 2:26:47.840]  can't even begin to look at this let alone brief some conclusions and he said
[2:26:47.840 --> 2:26:51.360]  well that's the way it is and I said no here's the way it is I'm gonna go to the
[2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:56.160]  media and say you're tying my hands on this issue well he obviously decided
[2:26:56.160 --> 2:27:02.240]  that that was a bigger problem than trying to go back explain to people what
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:06.400]  minister in the context because you're talking about lying by omission they
[2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:10.760]  set the parameters of the debate they say climate change is real it is bad it
[2:27:10.760 --> 2:27:15.760]  is man-made and they say the debate is settled yeah okay because what what
[2:27:15.760 --> 2:27:20.440]  Mars Strong did was the first thing is they used the definition of climate
[2:27:20.440 --> 2:27:25.400]  change established by the United Nations environment program which says we're
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:29.840]  only going to look at human causes of climate change that you can't possibly
[2:27:29.840 --> 2:27:34.800]  determine what affect humans are having if any unless you know how much nature
[2:27:34.800 --> 2:27:42.080]  is causing climate change so by limiting that IPCC with that definition alone the
[2:27:42.080 --> 2:27:45.600]  second important thing and there's some other terms of reference but the other
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:27:49.740]  one that's devastating is they they put in what's called the summary for
[2:27:49.740 --> 2:27:55.880]  policymakers now the group the group of CRU made sure that the scientists that
[2:27:55.880 --> 2:27:59.480]  were advising that summary for policymakers groups which were mostly
[2:27:59.480 --> 2:28:05.680]  politicians were part of their CRU group so people like Steven Schneider Michael
[2:28:05.680 --> 2:28:11.280]  Mann Phil Jones but the summary for policymakers the rules of it are you
[2:28:11.280 --> 2:28:16.000]  write your science or technical report group working group one you set that
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:21.640]  aside then the summary for policymakers groups will write a summary the summary
[2:28:21.640 --> 2:28:25.680]  then is released to the media immediately which of course and then it has
[2:28:25.680 --> 2:28:29.200]  all of the sensational stuff about all the world's gonna fry and this is gonna
[2:28:29.200 --> 2:28:34.120]  happen then the summary goes back to the scientific group with the instructions
[2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:38.760]  to make sure that the scientific report says what we've already said in the
[2:28:38.760 --> 2:28:43.520]  summary and released to the public so it's like it's like a an executive doing
[2:28:43.520 --> 2:28:47.600]  a summary and then telling the employees to find the facts to support the
[2:28:47.600 --> 2:28:52.400]  summary it is that incredible and unbelievable and if you want the the
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:57.040]  details of that I'm willing to share that with you of how strong did this to
[2:28:57.040 --> 2:29:02.640]  control the whole process and again Maury strong and admitted eugenesis we
[2:29:02.640 --> 2:29:07.520]  could play YouTube clip after YouTube clip of him on US television 10 years
[2:29:07.520 --> 2:29:14.920]  ago 20 30 years ago calling for forced one-child policies 80% population
[2:29:14.920 --> 2:29:20.840]  reduction drugging of water supply everything that's in John P. Holdren's
[2:29:20.840 --> 2:29:27.200]  textbook which was then adopted as policy but I also want to talk Tim about
[2:29:27.200 --> 2:29:32.120]  the media blockade how do we run that and how do we bring these people to
[2:29:32.120 --> 2:29:35.560]  justice because they're not only engaged in fraud in these emails and the
[2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:39.400]  computer code where their weather models are designed for fraud in the
[2:29:39.400 --> 2:29:44.360]  programmers own notes we have the programmers own notes that's we need to
[2:29:44.360 --> 2:29:48.840]  talk about that and criminal prosecution of these people for
[2:29:48.840 --> 2:29:56.040]  persecuting scientists like you we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex

[2:31:02.640 --> 2:31:06.520]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[2:31:06.520 --> 2:31:10.240]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[2:31:10.240 --> 2:31:14.200]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[2:31:14.200 --> 2:31:18.600]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[2:31:18.600 --> 2:31:23.040]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[2:31:23.040 --> 2:31:27.760]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:31:27.760 --> 2:31:31.560]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[2:32:55.040 --> 2:33:14.800]  that's tpr20info.com I'm going to open the phones up for questions specifically on
[2:33:14.800 --> 2:33:24.360]  climate gate for climatologist Dr. Tim Ball top-time climatologist 1-800-259-9231
[2:33:24.360 --> 2:33:34.800]  for Al Gore words are one thing lies he premeditatedly is making all this money
[2:33:34.800 --> 2:33:38.760]  off of this George Soros is openly funding it they're saying it's like
[2:33:38.760 --> 2:33:42.840]  Holocaust denial they're talking about in the emails how to persecute people how
[2:33:42.840 --> 2:33:47.200]  to block their papers for being published which destroy scientists I mean
[2:33:47.200 --> 2:33:51.720]  the civil lawsuit should be immediately filed by the people that have been
[2:33:51.720 --> 2:33:56.360]  harmed this is racketeering its powerful institutions and governments in the
[2:33:56.360 --> 2:33:59.880]  emails getting together to block for your request so the documents being
[2:33:59.880 --> 2:34:03.040]  requests wouldn't be released because scientists were going well your data
[2:34:03.040 --> 2:34:06.680]  doesn't match up to what these weather stations said it was shut up we're not
[2:34:06.680 --> 2:34:10.120]  going to release it you're funded by the oil companies when it's actually a lot
[2:34:10.120 --> 2:34:14.440]  of big oil companies financing this Dutch Royal Shell BP all these big money
[2:34:14.440 --> 2:34:18.960]  interests are actually behind this Dr. Tim Ball I want to get more into the
[2:34:18.960 --> 2:34:21.920]  science whatever issues you want to cover because you're the brain on this
[2:34:21.920 --> 2:34:28.240]  but I specifically want you to talk about justice and also by bringing these
[2:34:28.240 --> 2:34:32.040]  people to justice by suing them by criminal charges but government is
[2:34:32.040 --> 2:34:36.200]  behind this so they probably won't we will then further force this out into
[2:34:36.200 --> 2:34:40.440]  the open and start getting really aggressive with these people that want
[2:34:40.440 --> 2:34:44.840]  to tax us and control us and run our lives Dr. Tim Ball yeah well I couldn't
[2:34:44.840 --> 2:34:50.600]  agree more and by the way in a recent newsweek story Al Gore said facts are
[2:34:50.600 --> 2:34:55.400]  not enough well sorry now the facts are enough and and they're not in your
[2:34:55.400 --> 2:34:59.480]  favor but John Coleman who lives was really was the founder of the weather
[2:34:59.480 --> 2:35:03.800]  channel there was a rumor around that he was going to bring a lawsuit against
[2:35:03.800 --> 2:35:10.160]  Gore and it would parallel what you've just been talking about on a charge of
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:17.560]  fraud and he the grounds was that here Gore had gone out and said that CO2 and
[2:35:17.560 --> 2:35:23.280]  carbon as it's incorrectly called is a serious problem and that we've got to
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:28.280]  get rid of it we've got to deal with it and he then turned around and of course
[2:35:28.280 --> 2:35:34.160]  set up the sale of carbon credits and therefore that constitutes fraud because
[2:35:34.160 --> 2:35:41.640]  you falsely create the problem and then profit from it and Gore was involved in
[2:35:41.640 --> 2:35:45.880]  this and by the way Gore's been involved in not just the climate thing but you go
[2:35:45.880 --> 2:35:50.640]  back to the Club of Rome and the population over population issues and
[2:35:50.640 --> 2:36:00.920]  he chaired the 1994 conference in Cairo on it but the the the whole Gore issue
[2:36:00.920 --> 2:36:07.400]  of making profit in 1998 there was a conference or meeting I should say in
[2:36:07.400 --> 2:36:13.640]  the White House with Bill Clinton Al Gore Lord Brown of British Petroleum and
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:19.200]  of course you see them published putting out ads and so on and then the
[2:36:19.200 --> 2:36:23.680]  other the fourth person was Ken Lay of Enron and what they were did what they
[2:36:23.680 --> 2:36:29.840]  were discussing was how to keep the carbon credits market going because the
[2:36:29.840 --> 2:36:36.360]  carbon credits idea came out of an attempt to get the US to sign the
[2:36:36.360 --> 2:36:40.160]  Kyoto Treaty and the US said go well what what are you going to give us and
[2:36:40.160 --> 2:36:42.920]  they said well we'll what they said what do you want we said well we want some
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:46.280]  carbon credits for this stuff we're taking out of the air and the Europeans
[2:36:46.280 --> 2:36:51.560]  said no but anyway the Gore kept that going so Gore profited now I think that
[2:36:51.560 --> 2:36:57.160]  you could argue that these people not only the deliberate falsification of
[2:36:57.160 --> 2:37:01.480]  records which I would think in itself is criminal but but also the fact that
[2:37:01.480 --> 2:37:08.840]  they use their data to get huge amounts of government funding and and so to
[2:37:08.840 --> 2:37:13.360]  falsify applications for government funding I would think would would also
[2:37:13.360 --> 2:37:20.000]  be criminal in the Jones for example I think it's 21.6 million alone and when
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:24.600]  you look at the US an estimated 70 billion a year going into climate
[2:37:24.600 --> 2:37:30.240]  research in Canada the Environment Canada spent 6.8 billion in five years on
[2:37:30.240 --> 2:37:34.240]  climate change research that and all that went to funding well that's a key
[2:37:34.240 --> 2:37:37.560]  point let me throw in this piece of evidence the London Guardian two days
[2:37:37.560 --> 2:37:45.720]  ago had this headline in fact let's pull it up where the UN calls for global
[2:37:45.720 --> 2:37:51.840]  policing of technology and these select committees will decide what
[2:37:51.840 --> 2:37:56.360]  technologies are even allowed what old technologies will be banned or taxed and
[2:37:56.360 --> 2:38:00.720]  then what new technologies will be funded by government and then we see Al Gore
[2:38:00.720 --> 2:38:06.480]  already making hundreds of millions a year just off government grants to little
[2:38:06.480 --> 2:38:12.080]  green technology that's in quotes companies that he owns or owns a part of
[2:38:12.080 --> 2:38:17.280]  I mean this is a total hijacking of the economy by these people there it is
[2:38:17.280 --> 2:38:21.760]  global body needed to direct green technology g77 says London Guardian
[2:38:21.760 --> 2:38:26.880]  developed nations call for you and body to police battle on climate change I
[2:38:26.880 --> 2:38:31.120]  mean these guys it's not just the carbon credits or the carbon taxes it's
[2:38:31.120 --> 2:38:38.280]  taxes on beef televisions asphalt more than one child just literally water I
[2:38:38.280 --> 2:38:42.440]  mean they're announcing people think they're under taxes now notice right as
[2:38:42.440 --> 2:38:46.280]  the banks implode the economy the very same banks are now financing that the
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:53.000]  green takeover it's not green it is neo feudalism yeah and let me let me get
[2:38:53.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  just a bit it sounds like a small example but it's it's a perfect
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:00.840]  illustration of what you're talking about Alex I was just in Alberta at five
[2:39:00.840 --> 2:39:03.920]  different farm communities because I've been working with the farmers they're
[2:39:03.920 --> 2:39:09.000]  the ones most directly infected by weather and climate and and prior to my
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:13.480]  presentation and I it was sort of a dog and pony show but there was a company
[2:39:13.480 --> 2:39:18.640]  selling carbon credits to the farmers and okay fine that there's a business
[2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:22.840]  opportunity and and you guys are taking advantage of it that's so that's the way
[2:39:22.840 --> 2:39:27.760]  the free market works and the government have created this opportunity by what
[2:39:27.760 --> 2:39:32.040]  they're doing with carbon tax and so on but when when the farmers started to
[2:39:32.040 --> 2:39:36.720]  hear from this private company because one of the farmers said well if I if I
[2:39:36.720 --> 2:39:41.720]  tell you that I'm planning this crop or I'm doing that in order to get to sell
[2:39:41.720 --> 2:39:46.720]  carbon credits how are you going to know that I'm being honest about it well the
[2:39:46.720 --> 2:39:51.080]  guy just said well hang on a minute he said first of all we've got we've got
[2:39:51.080 --> 2:39:55.960]  data on every single farm in Western Canada he said we know the precise size
[2:39:55.960 --> 2:40:00.000]  of your farm we know the acreage we know what you planted we've got access to
[2:40:00.000 --> 2:40:06.280]  land titles we've got access to your to your your whole budget and funding of
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:11.520]  your farm and and then one farmer popped up and he said well you know I I took
[2:40:11.520 --> 2:40:15.480]  some of the government money because I'm in forage crops and they said oh he
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:19.000]  could reduce methane and you could take this money the next thing he knew there
[2:40:19.000 --> 2:40:22.680]  was a government agent on his farm telling him what he could grow and and
[2:40:22.680 --> 2:40:27.960]  his crop rotation so we've already got illustrations of of the degree to which
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:33.000]  this infiltrates down to the individual and the individual let me stop you
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:35.760]  again though and ask you this question because you're so knowledgeable in all
[2:40:35.760 --> 2:40:40.680]  these subjects he's been in it for decades dealing with this we see the
[2:40:40.680 --> 2:40:46.080]  NFL we see Hollywood we see news core we see almost every major fortune 500
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:51.840]  company the oil companies the banks all behind this green propaganda everywhere
[2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:56.720]  electric cars windmills things that sound great advancement they have a
[2:40:56.720 --> 2:41:01.560]  sugar coating on this takeover of things that sound reasonable but that's all
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:06.200]  just window dressing they're not going to stop now because we've caught them in
[2:41:06.200 --> 2:41:10.520]  all this fraud they're going to continue because the entire power structure
[2:41:10.520 --> 2:41:15.640]  has admitted that this is the main funding mechanism and regulatory global
[2:41:15.640 --> 2:41:23.760]  control for world government as Maury strong and Al Gore and the new head of
[2:41:23.760 --> 2:41:31.320]  the U.N. the new Ban Ki-moon the new head of the EU Von Rumpi they admit this
[2:41:31.320 --> 2:41:35.120]  is the key to their whole world government they hadn't expected us to be
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:39.320]  this effective they thought they just call us Holocaust deniers you know if you
[2:41:39.320 --> 2:41:43.080]  call Obama a socialist you hate black people has nothing to do with it this
[2:41:43.080 --> 2:41:47.960]  isn't working anymore so knowing them what do you expect them to do go to some
[2:41:47.960 --> 2:41:52.000]  new crisis you know they're now saying the oceans are going to turn into acid
[2:41:52.000 --> 2:41:55.600]  I mean are they going to say that that that I mean what's their new fraud going
[2:41:55.600 --> 2:41:59.520]  to be and how do you see them countering this well of course one of the
[2:41:59.520 --> 2:42:04.360]  arguments is coming back is that well okay these guys cook the data but there's
[2:42:04.360 --> 2:42:07.840]  still enough evidence out there that global warming is occurring and that
[2:42:07.840 --> 2:42:14.880]  the CO2 is increasing in fact there was a report from a government agency just
[2:42:14.880 --> 2:42:19.080]  the other day before yesterday saying oh look CO2 levels are continuing to rise
[2:42:19.080 --> 2:42:25.040]  well yes so what and the fact is that what caused them to shift from talking
[2:42:25.040 --> 2:42:29.760]  about global warming to climate change was that from 2002 on the temperature
[2:42:29.760 --> 2:42:34.240]  started to go down but the CO2 continued to rise and we know from the
[2:42:34.240 --> 2:42:39.840]  science there is no connection between CO2 and temperature and and one of the
[2:42:39.840 --> 2:42:44.080]  things that's happened in the science community here Alex is they completely
[2:42:44.080 --> 2:42:48.520]  hijacked the scientific method because what happens is that our scientist comes
[2:42:48.520 --> 2:42:52.680]  up with a theory which is based on certain assumptions and then other
[2:42:52.680 --> 2:42:57.000]  scientists will challenge that notice that it's still Einstein's theory of
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:02.040]  relativity after a hundred and seven years it's still Darwin's theory of
[2:43:02.040 --> 2:43:06.880]  evolution after a hundred and fifty years because there's other scientists
[2:43:06.880 --> 2:43:11.560]  have a lot of questions that just don't fit but what happened with the what's
[2:43:11.560 --> 2:43:16.280]  called the anthropogenic global warming theory was it became a fact almost
[2:43:16.280 --> 2:43:21.120]  instantly and Richard Linsen at MIT who's also been in the forefront and of
[2:43:21.120 --> 2:43:27.160]  both the charge and the insult and getting the insults he said a long
[2:43:27.160 --> 2:43:31.000]  time ago the consensus was reached before the research was even begun now
[2:43:31.000 --> 2:43:35.440]  with Einstein as an example one of the assumptions that his formula is based
[2:43:35.440 --> 2:43:38.800]  on is that nothing can go faster than the speed of light well there are
[2:43:38.800 --> 2:43:42.200]  scientists that are saying look we're finding things going faster than the
[2:43:42.200 --> 2:43:46.680]  speed of light if that turns out to be true then Einstein's theory has either
[2:43:46.680 --> 2:43:51.000]  got to be rewritten or thrown out well with the anthropogenic global warming
[2:43:51.000 --> 2:43:55.120]  the fundamental assumption is that if CO2 increases in the atmosphere the
[2:43:55.120 --> 2:44:00.160]  temperature will go up in every single record that we've got for any duration
[2:44:00.160 --> 2:44:05.160]  of any time period the temperature increases before the CO2 not as they
[2:44:05.160 --> 2:44:09.160]  assume and by the way that assumption is built into their computer models which
[2:44:09.160 --> 2:44:15.320]  is why they are consistently wrong and I remember in 1991 when they can't
[2:44:15.320 --> 2:44:19.640]  jousel the Frenchman came out with the ice core from Antarctica which is now
[2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:23.560]  the Gorse got in his movie you know he said here's the idea that he very
[2:44:23.560 --> 2:44:27.480]  cleverly separated the CO2 and the temperature because when you put them
[2:44:27.480 --> 2:44:31.600]  together you see that the temperature is causing the CO2 to change not the
[2:44:31.600 --> 2:44:35.560]  other way around and they knew that but let me stop you again yeah about five
[2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:41.880]  years ago a University of Chicago historian wrote a book saying the
[2:44:41.880 --> 2:44:48.520]  founding fathers were anti-gun only 10% of colonial families owned guns the
[2:44:48.520 --> 2:44:53.040]  second amendment is not an individual right to keep their arms then top
[2:44:53.040 --> 2:44:57.920]  historians actually went to the church records areas to the university record
[2:44:57.920 --> 2:45:04.160]  areas and found out it was all a fraud all made up by the anti-gun lobby funded
[2:45:04.160 --> 2:45:08.520]  by the Rockefellers the usual suspects now so there's there's not gonna make
[2:45:08.520 --> 2:45:11.560]  fraud everywhere when government the Rockefellers and the UN are involved
[2:45:11.560 --> 2:45:19.360]  that professor lost his tenure and was removed okay so so shouldn't we see
[2:45:19.360 --> 2:45:24.840]  these professors caught lying at bare minimum lose their tenure absolutely and
[2:45:24.840 --> 2:45:29.520]  and I thought this but when I was in the university you know I mean there were
[2:45:29.520 --> 2:45:33.480]  there were some of my colleagues doing all sorts of terrible things and and it
[2:45:33.480 --> 2:45:37.600]  was just but simply a cover-up and for example the University of Guelph I
[2:45:37.600 --> 2:45:41.320]  pointed out a hundred years not one person with ten years ever been fired
[2:45:41.320 --> 2:45:44.680]  you telling me in a hundred years that not one of them did anything that was
[2:45:44.680 --> 2:45:49.680]  what that was criminal or wrong and in the university contracts with faculty
[2:45:49.680 --> 2:45:55.640]  there is nearly always what's called a moral turpitude clause and this is and
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:45:58.600]  I used to joke about it I said if I'm gonna get fired I want to be caught
[2:45:58.600 --> 2:46:03.120]  naked in my office with a hundred female students and I get fired for moral
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:08.360]  turpitude that way but nobody's ever challenged it and I suspect when you
[2:46:08.360 --> 2:46:12.120]  look at the contracts that these people have with the universities there's going
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:18.840]  to be sufficient vehicles by which they can be brought to justice well bare
[2:46:18.840 --> 2:46:23.240]  minimum I mean justice says this has to happen because here they are secretly
[2:46:23.240 --> 2:46:28.000]  trying to cut people's funding to persecute to keep scientists from being
[2:46:28.000 --> 2:46:32.800]  published in journals which destroys their careers I mean they are and then
[2:46:32.800 --> 2:46:37.400]  they're in the London Guardian today whining and complaining calling
[2:46:37.400 --> 2:46:45.280]  themselves victims of persecution when they are the persecutor in fact here's
[2:46:45.280 --> 2:46:51.200]  the article leaked emails mark dangerous shift in climate denial strategy and the
[2:46:51.200 --> 2:46:58.520]  article by Mark Lannis is written as if the the people that put the emails out
[2:46:58.520 --> 2:47:05.600]  are desperate evil frauds and it accuses all of us who are criticizing them and
[2:47:05.600 --> 2:47:09.600]  questioning their their their I mean these socialists these globalists these
[2:47:09.600 --> 2:47:14.400]  eugenicists they're not liberals they're a cult of control freaks who love
[2:47:14.400 --> 2:47:19.000]  lording over everyone and bossing everybody around and acting like they
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:25.520]  have all the answers and to read this article I mean it's so sick and now to
[2:47:25.520 --> 2:47:31.360]  find out that the BBC five weeks before was sent these leaked or hacked however
[2:47:31.360 --> 2:47:34.120]  they came out the media said hacked I guess they said hacked so they can block
[2:47:34.120 --> 2:47:39.080]  their release later probably were just leaked that the BBC wouldn't discuss them
[2:47:39.080 --> 2:47:43.240]  I mean this is incredible well Andrew can use that argument he said we wouldn't
[2:47:43.240 --> 2:47:46.720]  we wouldn't comment on this because it was leaked documents but they'd written
[2:47:46.720 --> 2:47:50.600]  other stories earlier where the stuff was leaked in a story that favored them
[2:47:50.600 --> 2:47:55.160]  and they didn't hesitate to use it but by the way what you're talking about with
[2:47:55.160 --> 2:48:00.320]  regard to this victim defense that's the modern thing that's called victimology
[2:48:00.320 --> 2:48:05.960]  and and it becomes a standard defense that that the person it becomes a the
[2:48:05.960 --> 2:48:11.520]  the victim I mean it comedians make jokes about it is that that wonderful
[2:48:11.520 --> 2:48:16.320]  thing that the lawyer defending a guy that was on trial for murdering both
[2:48:16.320 --> 2:48:20.520]  his parents and he pleaded for clemency on the grounds that the guy was an orphan
[2:48:20.520 --> 2:48:26.520]  you know this is the kind of mentality that these people use well here's one
[2:48:26.520 --> 2:48:31.400]  here's one he hired one of the fanciest criminal lawyers in New York the guy
[2:48:31.400 --> 2:48:38.120]  that on record tried to extort and and and defraud and blackmail David Letterman
[2:48:38.120 --> 2:48:43.480]  he's doing a victim defense saying David Letterman was mean doing this to his
[2:48:43.480 --> 2:48:47.760]  girlfriend dating her and and and that he was just trying to sell him a movie
[2:48:47.760 --> 2:48:53.240]  script I mean the spin that comes out of these people yeah yeah and of course I
[2:48:53.240 --> 2:48:59.640]  like Glenn Beck said classification of them as progressives and that gets you
[2:48:59.640 --> 2:49:05.160]  away from this right wing left wing and all of that and and of course you know
[2:49:05.160 --> 2:49:10.760]  by the way I call I refer to the scandals in Scandinavia because should
[2:49:10.760 --> 2:49:15.280]  these people now have their Nobel prizes withdrawn I mean certainly Gore and
[2:49:15.280 --> 2:49:21.440]  and the IPCC got them on the basis of all this false information and as you
[2:49:21.440 --> 2:49:26.760]  know they were screams at the time about that and but see it's the big global
[2:49:26.760 --> 2:49:30.760]  money that once all this that's why they're giving awards to their pet
[2:49:30.760 --> 2:49:34.720]  scientists that push this that's why we'll never get justice but here's
[2:49:34.720 --> 2:49:38.480]  another issue yeah as you know in Canada the US Europe England Australia New
[2:49:38.480 --> 2:49:42.640]  Zealand everywhere they're brainwashing the kids in school yeah far worse than
[2:49:42.640 --> 2:49:46.320]  just we have warming but that we're all dead and you know kids have to commit
[2:49:46.320 --> 2:49:51.040]  suicide at 11 when their carbon credits run out ABC news you can't make up this
[2:49:51.040 --> 2:49:55.960]  how sick these people are we've got to really go into the schools and say this
[2:49:55.960 --> 2:50:00.960]  is a proven fraud stop teaching it yeah well of course I've been involved in
[2:50:00.960 --> 2:50:05.080]  in and one of the things that I've tried to do in my life Alex is I don't think
[2:50:05.080 --> 2:50:09.160]  that one has a right to be a hypercritical you obviously as a human
[2:50:09.160 --> 2:50:13.360]  being you're entitled to your right to your own opinions but to go public with
[2:50:13.360 --> 2:50:17.560]  criticism you unless you're willing to get involved and try to do something
[2:50:17.560 --> 2:50:21.920]  about it I don't think that you should be very cautious I've been involved in
[2:50:21.920 --> 2:50:26.000]  Kate to 12 and through the university in other words the whole education system
[2:50:26.000 --> 2:50:29.920]  throughout my career and what triggered it was that I discovered that the
[2:50:29.920 --> 2:50:33.720]  colleagues in my dog my department of the university didn't even know what
[2:50:33.720 --> 2:50:37.440]  textbooks were being used in the high school and I say well how can you
[2:50:37.440 --> 2:50:41.200]  possibly deal with the students which are your raw material if you don't know
[2:50:41.200 --> 2:50:45.240]  what they know and where they're coming from so and I so I dealt with this I
[2:50:45.240 --> 2:50:50.000]  think called agriculture in the classroom back in the classroom where the
[2:50:50.000 --> 2:50:54.440]  teachers especially in the social studies areas and their tendency to be left
[2:50:54.440 --> 2:51:00.960]  wing using that classroom to push their own ideologies stay there stay there

[2:52:20.040 --> 2:52:24.640]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[2:52:24.640 --> 2:52:29.040]  citizens to pay attention full of the republic identifies the enemies of our

[2:54:14.360 --> 2:54:19.280]  to niggle first you're on the air with climatologist dr. Tim ball persecuted
[2:54:19.280 --> 2:54:23.920]  one of the most persecuted people out there because he was so dead on with
[2:54:23.920 --> 2:54:28.960]  his research and now completely vindicated in spades caller in Japan
[2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:36.560]  you're on the air with our guests go ahead hello I just want to say that I
[2:54:36.560 --> 2:54:40.920]  don't want to contradict with the cutting in the rainforest much but it
[2:54:40.920 --> 2:54:45.200]  the trees do take hundreds of years to grow and that when they do get cut down
[2:54:45.200 --> 2:54:49.960]  they don't that the whole ecosystem does get destroyed there's so many
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:55.680]  animals that depend on that a very that was last hour's guess the point is the
[2:54:55.680 --> 2:54:59.120]  globalist Al Gore actually with Occidental petroleum was cutting down
[2:54:59.120 --> 2:55:05.040]  rainforest but using it as a way to get donations for themselves clearly that's
[2:55:05.040 --> 2:55:09.640]  more of an environmental threat than carbon dioxide and genetic engineering
[2:55:09.640 --> 2:55:13.440]  open-air cross species there are environmental issues the point is the
[2:55:13.440 --> 2:55:18.160]  groups running all this could care less about that dr. Tim ball well and of
[2:55:18.160 --> 2:55:21.560]  course one of the things that triggered the increase of cutting of the rainforest
[2:55:21.560 --> 2:55:27.960]  was the World Bank giving money to Brazil on condition that they cleared
[2:55:27.960 --> 2:55:32.800]  the forest and and and develop their agriculture to form a good agricultural
[2:55:32.800 --> 2:55:38.840]  base to the economy just as as in the US once they stop that funding the level
[2:55:38.840 --> 2:55:43.320]  of cutting to drop dramatically again every time I look it's the globalist
[2:55:43.320 --> 2:55:46.760]  that are actually hurting the earth and then they they create the crisis and
[2:55:46.760 --> 2:55:50.840]  then offer the solution yeah exactly and and not only that but there was no real
[2:55:50.840 --> 2:55:56.040]  measure of how much forest had been cut and a few Swedish experts said let's
[2:55:56.040 --> 2:56:01.240]  get a measure of this and it turned out that the the numbers given were by
[2:56:01.240 --> 2:56:04.880]  accounts at the World Bank who went to the scientists and said well how much
[2:56:04.880 --> 2:56:08.160]  forest is cut and how much gonna cut this year and they said we don't know so
[2:56:08.160 --> 2:56:11.000]  they made up a number and it turned out that the number that was in
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:16.080]  circulation and used by everybody was at least 85% in excess of the actual
[2:56:16.080 --> 2:56:20.920]  number yeah niggle I agree with you that destroying old growth needs to be
[2:56:20.920 --> 2:56:24.920]  controlled because that's regrow the different than old growth there but
[2:56:24.920 --> 2:56:31.200]  anything else niggle yes I highly recommend seeing rebels wanted calm
[2:56:31.200 --> 2:56:36.680]  because there's so much information on there about the environment and the
[2:56:36.680 --> 2:56:40.760]  health section is so important we appreciate your call sir thank you
[2:56:40.760 --> 2:56:44.800]  Nolan in Texas going as many calls as possible Nolan you're on the air but
[2:56:44.800 --> 2:56:50.280]  climatologist Tim ball dr. Ball I would like to know based on these emails that
[2:56:50.280 --> 2:56:55.160]  have come out is there a way that we can draw a line between the UN or or any
[2:56:55.160 --> 2:57:01.960]  governmental or any globalist bunch and these scientists that show that their
[2:57:01.960 --> 2:57:05.680]  funding was predicated on their findings and that the funding was through
[2:57:05.680 --> 2:57:11.080]  either the UN or or someone controlled by and friendly to their oh yeah dr.
[2:57:11.080 --> 2:57:16.800]  Ball go ahead there really isn't a way of drawing a line because one of the
[2:57:16.800 --> 2:57:20.120]  things that strong did and unfortunately to my own government were
[2:57:20.120 --> 2:57:26.440]  deeply involved in this was that the IPCC and they kept talking about 2,500
[2:57:26.440 --> 2:57:31.120]  scientists the majority of them are bureaucrats appointed by their
[2:57:31.120 --> 2:57:35.560]  individual governments and as Lyndon said when he finally resigned from the IPCC
[2:57:35.560 --> 2:57:40.240]  he said these people know nothing about climate they're simply put on there
[2:57:40.240 --> 2:57:45.960]  because they will parrot the government position and and so if there's so much
[2:57:45.960 --> 2:57:52.840]  intertwining between the scientists and the UN that as I said the the only way
[2:57:52.840 --> 2:58:00.000]  to really deal with it is to Nolan is to shut down the IPCC completely look all
[2:58:00.000 --> 2:58:04.800]  these guys are creatures of the UN they pick they pick the universities they
[2:58:04.800 --> 2:58:10.160]  want to use because they are giving them the data they want yeah yeah it's it's
[2:58:10.160 --> 2:58:14.800]  so intertwined that it's kind of like doing a brain surgery where you know
[2:58:14.800 --> 2:58:21.000]  we the danger of cutting something bad say no sorry there's nothing I can do
[2:58:21.000 --> 2:58:25.560]  about this we just got to let it run its course and and the course it's got a
[2:58:25.560 --> 2:58:30.960]  run is to scrap the IPCC yeah I mean the UN is a group of criminals they're
[2:58:30.960 --> 2:58:36.880]  constantly caught in child sex slave rings money for oil scams I mean it's
[2:58:36.880 --> 2:58:41.680]  just a grip of degenerate scum more call straight ahead
[2:58:42.680 --> 2:58:51.360]  thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN live comm today have you

[3:00:18.160 --> 3:00:22.360]  this is going to go over a bunch of news and comment it with Darrell coming up
[3:00:22.360 --> 3:00:27.000]  the final segment with dr. Tim ball ladies and gentlemen we can't just let
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:31.360]  these internal emails come and go we have the code they use in the
[3:00:31.360 --> 3:00:37.240]  climatology models where again there's notes by the programmers here's how you
[3:00:37.240 --> 3:00:41.560]  make the fraud work here's how you make colder temperatures look higher here's
[3:00:41.560 --> 3:00:45.440]  how we do it I mean that's all and there's thousands of pages more and more
[3:00:45.440 --> 3:00:50.120]  is being analyzed now it's getting worse by the minute and imagine if other
[3:00:50.120 --> 3:00:55.080]  people inside institutions start leaking stuff I mean this could really bring
[3:00:55.080 --> 3:00:59.040]  them down couldn't it doctor oh absolutely and and of course as I said
[3:00:59.040 --> 3:01:05.240]  this core at the CRU and that's why I think it was hacked or at least I think
[3:01:05.240 --> 3:01:08.960]  that it's a whistleblower because I think somebody inside and there are some
[3:01:08.960 --> 3:01:12.280]  comments in some of the emails saying you know should we really be doing this
[3:01:12.280 --> 3:01:16.000]  isn't this going a bit too far so clearly there were some people in there
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:20.640]  with a little bit of conscience and I suspect that one of them saw Copenhagen
[3:01:20.640 --> 3:01:25.240]  looting and these things being completely globally instant institutionalized and
[3:01:25.240 --> 3:01:30.080]  and said no I've got I've got to get this stuff out there so yeah because I've
[3:01:30.080 --> 3:01:34.160]  talked to a lot of environmentalists they go okay carbon dioxide isn't bad but
[3:01:34.160 --> 3:01:38.000]  we've got to do this to develop new technologies we've got a lie and I think
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:42.320]  a lot of them are going man global government run by Ken lay who set this
[3:01:42.320 --> 3:01:48.160]  up what I mean yeah he's the reason that partially the reason the main reason
[3:01:48.160 --> 3:01:52.200]  actually that argue that that California is in such trouble because he talked
[3:01:52.200 --> 3:01:56.880]  them into all their energy policies and so that's a great part of the
[3:01:56.880 --> 3:02:00.440]  difficulty let's take another call Don and Ohio you're on the air with Dr.
[3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:05.480]  Tim ball go ahead is there a possible correlation between the timeline of J
[3:02:05.480 --> 3:02:09.320]  Rockefeller stating the internet should never have existed and when the BBC
[3:02:09.320 --> 3:02:13.080]  first got the information that the climate info was hacked and they refuse
[3:02:13.080 --> 3:02:19.040]  to talk about it you know that did happen around the same time yeah I think I
[3:02:19.040 --> 3:02:22.520]  think that that's a that's a very good point and of course what we're seeing
[3:02:22.520 --> 3:02:29.960]  here is is the value of the internet because up until that really came on
[3:02:29.960 --> 3:02:34.920]  the scene information which we've always known was power was initially
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:39.320]  controlled by the monarchies and so on and of course the establishment of the
[3:02:39.320 --> 3:02:44.840]  US and then democracy and then the whole father's confederation saying no
[3:02:44.840 --> 3:02:48.120]  everything's got to be available to everybody and everybody's got to have
[3:02:48.120 --> 3:02:52.840]  some input to it but that really didn't materialize until the internet came out
[3:02:52.840 --> 3:02:59.520]  there and and it's really the true democratization of information yes so
[3:02:59.520 --> 3:03:03.600]  Rockefeller realized that and realized how important it was to control it I
[3:03:03.600 --> 3:03:07.000]  agree and they're now announcing they plan to incrementally shut it down
[3:03:07.000 --> 3:03:13.200]  anything else done we know exactly what day it was released to the BBC and they
[3:03:13.200 --> 3:03:20.040]  refused it about six is six weeks ago 12 I believe was the date when I stand to
[3:03:20.040 --> 3:03:23.080]  be corrected on that but I believe that was that you could check on on climate
[3:03:23.080 --> 3:03:29.800]  depot the epot climate depot with the with the mark morano he's got the date
[3:03:29.800 --> 3:03:33.960]  on there on that story they say five weeks ago so that's about six weeks ago
[3:03:33.960 --> 3:03:38.680]  now yeah you know the rumors of this were floating around Tuesday Wednesday
[3:03:38.680 --> 3:03:43.600]  Thursday then it was confirmed Friday because I remember seeing blurbs this
[3:03:43.600 --> 3:03:47.480]  stuff's been hacked we were like is this real and then I just want to salute the
[3:03:47.480 --> 3:03:51.520]  people that got this out whether they're hackers or leakers Gregory in Indiana
[3:03:51.520 --> 3:03:57.000]  you got about 30 seconds go ahead thanks Alex thanks Alex for taking my call I
[3:03:57.000 --> 3:04:02.480]  got a question for dr. Ball if these guys were to get charged where where would
[3:04:02.480 --> 3:04:07.000]  the jurisdiction be in the courts or to be in the US or in Brussels an
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:10.920]  international court well we don't want to you and it'd be local
[3:04:10.920 --> 3:04:16.240]  occurred in the UK and but some of the people involved are outside of the UK
[3:04:16.240 --> 3:04:21.080]  Michael man for example is that Penn State and somebody said it should be
[3:04:21.080 --> 3:04:30.120]  state 10 but in the US so yeah possibly and certainly because of the
[3:04:30.120 --> 3:04:37.000]  involvement of the United Nations making it global maybe the world court is the
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:41.080]  venue but the difficulty is the world court hasn't got a particularly good
[3:04:41.080 --> 3:04:45.080]  track record either run by the same people yeah dr. Tim ball I want to get
[3:04:45.080 --> 3:04:49.000]  you back up again in the next few weeks have a great weekend coming up a great
[3:04:49.000 --> 3:04:52.520]  Thanksgiving God bless you for your courage in the face of these criminals

[3:10:29.840 --> 3:10:34.520]  his attitude his whole world view he's a good guy but I wanted to get him down
[3:10:34.520 --> 3:10:41.440]  here a few weeks ago because he tries to hand out on public sidewalks in Dallas
[3:10:41.440 --> 3:10:45.240]  religious Christian tracks and even if you hate Christians I'm a Christian I
[3:10:45.240 --> 3:10:48.240]  like real Christians I know it's real Christians that ended slavery real
[3:10:48.240 --> 3:10:51.280]  Christians that fight tyranny real Christians that are really out on the
[3:10:51.280 --> 3:10:54.760]  front lines I see their fruits and I'm a Christian brought up a Christian a
[3:10:54.760 --> 3:11:01.560]  Baptist but even if you're a Buddhist or an atheist or whatever you are you
[3:11:01.560 --> 3:11:06.000]  should support their free speech and I've noticed that governments support the
[3:11:06.000 --> 3:11:09.560]  free speech of every other group but Christians and they particularly I mean
[3:11:09.560 --> 3:11:15.640]  I've got video in my film martial law that YouTube banned saying it was too
[3:11:15.640 --> 3:11:19.360]  too intense that video is banned or you have to put in the you know that you're
[3:11:19.360 --> 3:11:23.840]  18 and log in to see it but it's banned from the main YouTube site where they
[3:11:23.840 --> 3:11:27.160]  take Christians sitting on sidewalks and break their arms and the federal judge
[3:11:27.160 --> 3:11:31.000]  said we're allowed to torture America it's paying compliance so forget Abu
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:36.320]  Ghaib forget Camp X-ray in Guantanamo I've always seen a special persecution of
[3:11:36.320 --> 3:11:40.640]  Christians now the judge has ruled you don't have free speech and they're
[3:11:40.640 --> 3:11:43.680]  ruling all over the country Travis County right now was in the paper is
[3:11:43.680 --> 3:11:47.720]  saying you can't wear political t-shirts saying any message in the county
[3:11:47.720 --> 3:11:52.160]  commissioners court free speech is being lost George Bush tried to have free
[3:11:52.160 --> 3:11:55.600]  speech zones and so much more thousands of lawsuits when I say thousands they
[3:11:55.600 --> 3:11:59.520]  lost over a thousand in New York over the RNC where I saw mainline reporters
[3:11:59.520 --> 3:12:04.600]  being arrested for no reason there is an attack on free speech and Dallas of all
[3:12:04.600 --> 3:12:07.960]  places is this Christianoid a lot of good people a lot of my family I'm from
[3:12:07.960 --> 3:12:13.200]  there but there is this fake Christianoid atmosphere in Dallas and there's been a
[3:12:13.200 --> 3:12:17.160]  horrible court ruling he's going to appeal it and we're gonna talk about the
[3:12:17.160 --> 3:12:20.000]  climate situation we're gonna talk about the police state we're gonna talk about
[3:12:20.000 --> 3:12:23.640]  you know Darrell's a successful stock trader and gold trader and silver
[3:12:23.640 --> 3:12:28.560]  trader and commodities guy and you know had sold a huge marketing business he
[3:12:28.560 --> 3:12:32.760]  had so I'm gonna get his take on gold the dollar where we're going all of this
[3:12:32.760 --> 3:12:37.200]  but I wanted to have Darrell run his first breakdown this important case in
[3:12:37.200 --> 3:12:42.040]  Dallas which is happening at the state level all over the country and all these
[3:12:42.040 --> 3:12:46.400]  new taxes I mean government is just out of control Darrell good to have you it's
[3:12:46.400 --> 3:12:49.440]  great to be here Alex thanks for having me and it's great to meet your wife in
[3:12:49.440 --> 3:12:53.040]  person hey you know she's definitely the better looking of the two so that's
[3:12:53.040 --> 3:12:56.880]  that's good looking yeah but she's way better looking than me no two ways about
[3:12:56.880 --> 3:13:00.040]  it if we she wasn't so shy we'd get her here on camera that would be a lot of
[3:13:00.040 --> 3:13:03.320]  fun she's very sweet she has she's definitely the best thing she looks
[3:13:03.320 --> 3:13:05.880]  great we're just having surgery a few weeks ago no yes she's doing good you
[3:13:05.880 --> 3:13:09.280]  know they do that lithoscopic kind of thing now so they don't even slice you
[3:13:09.280 --> 3:13:13.640]  open for an appendectomy so got her she recovered quickly and we thank God for
[3:13:13.640 --> 3:13:16.680]  that but I got to tell you something what we're not recovering from in this
[3:13:16.680 --> 3:13:20.340]  country is the tyranny I mean it's just getting crazy out there between this
[3:13:20.340 --> 3:13:24.880]  climate bill right you got tax you know car tax and trade I don't forget cap and
[3:13:24.880 --> 3:13:28.280]  trade it's tax and trade it's about control it's about command I mean we
[3:13:28.280 --> 3:13:32.000]  have every branch of our government including the free speech in the free
[3:13:32.000 --> 3:13:36.680]  press that fourth leg of government completely completely saturated with
[3:13:36.680 --> 3:13:41.840]  people that have nothing nothing to do with our best interest they hate freedom
[3:13:41.840 --> 3:13:45.320]  they hate freedom they hate liberty they hate justice I can get no justice in
[3:13:45.320 --> 3:13:50.440]  the courts the common man certainly can if you have no money you have no justice
[3:13:50.440 --> 3:13:53.200]  in this country that's that's that you have money and still couldn't get
[3:13:53.200 --> 3:13:56.840]  justice yeah it doesn't even matter and speaking of money not only did we lose
[3:13:56.840 --> 3:14:00.440]  the case against the state fair where they were clearly threatening us with
[3:14:00.440 --> 3:14:04.480]  arrest on public property and check out the the YouTube video I mean it's it's
[3:14:04.480 --> 3:14:09.960]  clear as day but then the judge awards unprecedented Alex unprecedented court
[3:14:09.960 --> 3:14:14.720]  costs in the amount of twenty nine thousand dollars get that twenty nine
[3:14:14.720 --> 3:14:19.960]  thousand dollars for copies of documents that we didn't even ask for but they ran
[3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:24.320]  up a huge bill in hopes they'd win so that then they could chill future free
[3:14:24.320 --> 3:14:29.600]  speech cases so now in America you were arrested you were violated you fought it
[3:14:29.600 --> 3:14:33.960]  you pay that's the British system we didn't have that system here and they're
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:38.040]  just doing it with a judge's order I believe he needs to have a judicial
[3:14:38.040 --> 3:14:41.960]  complaint filed on him well we're doing everything we can not only in the appeal
[3:14:41.960 --> 3:14:46.040]  but to you know get out there in the press just like coming on your show today
[3:14:46.040 --> 3:14:49.920]  to tell people look if it can happen to me it can happen to you it can happen to
[3:14:49.920 --> 3:14:53.480]  everyone let's go back let's tell the story of what happened because I've
[3:14:53.480 --> 3:14:57.320]  even seen the news they're persecuting Christians all over Dallas and you're
[3:14:57.320 --> 3:15:01.000]  not in America you can't go out and share the word with someone look I got a
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:04.600]  recorded conversation from the chief vice the assistant to the chief of
[3:15:04.600 --> 3:15:08.680]  police prior to going out there saying that it's clearly public property we
[3:15:08.680 --> 3:15:12.040]  had every right to be out there to exercise our First Amendment right keep
[3:15:12.040 --> 3:15:16.320]  in mind when you're proselytizing religion you're not just exercising
[3:15:16.320 --> 3:15:20.440]  right to free speech but also the freedom of that is the most protected in
[3:15:20.440 --> 3:15:23.600]  the First Amendment it's doubly the only thing doubly mentioned well
[3:15:23.600 --> 3:15:27.840]  technically it's triply protected because it's good news so it's really an
[3:15:27.840 --> 3:15:32.280]  issue of speech and the press and the freedom of worship and religion and so
[3:15:32.280 --> 3:15:35.600]  when you exercise that right to free speech and to go out and do what Christ
[3:15:35.600 --> 3:15:39.680]  called all Christians to do and that's what what's the passage in the Bible
[3:15:39.680 --> 3:15:43.680]  where Paul says you know they had a godliness about them but not the power
[3:15:43.680 --> 3:15:47.920]  second Timothy I mean because if you really are tied into the almighty
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:51.440]  creator who wants justice you can't control yourself you've got to go out
[3:15:51.440 --> 3:15:54.320]  and fight evil absolutely I mean I mean so these people really aren't Christians
[3:15:54.320 --> 3:15:58.600]  if you're not literally burning like Ezekiel said in your bones like God
[3:15:58.600 --> 3:16:02.160]  they're gonna kill me if I don't shut up but I can't shut up that's why you do
[3:16:02.160 --> 3:16:05.640]  what you do Alex you've been called to be a watchman on the wall to warn to
[3:16:05.640 --> 3:16:09.920]  sound the trumpet call to all the people of the city hey tyranny's coming evils
[3:16:09.920 --> 3:16:13.040]  coming they're coming to take our city they're gonna take your kids they're
[3:16:13.040 --> 3:16:15.720]  gonna take your wealth they're gonna take the same stuff that happened to
[3:16:15.720 --> 3:16:19.920]  3,000 years ago is what's happening now absolutely evil doesn't change now evil
[3:16:19.920 --> 3:16:23.840]  is evil and it's permeating not just this country but the entire world and
[3:16:23.840 --> 3:16:27.160]  Christians in particular ought to do what I do and what do you do and other
[3:16:27.160 --> 3:16:30.440]  Christians that really want you to tell that story but you're such a great
[3:16:30.440 --> 3:16:33.640]  Bible scholar have such a strong spirit of the Lord in you explain people what
[3:16:33.640 --> 3:16:35.840]  that means because that really hit me last night I heard a preacher on the
[3:16:35.840 --> 3:16:40.920]  radio locally he has a jurist dictionary I think same as the show but he was he
[3:16:40.920 --> 3:16:46.120]  was talking about about they have a kind of godliness but but they don't have the
[3:16:46.120 --> 3:16:49.760]  power and I mean if you don't have the power you're not really tied into God
[3:16:49.760 --> 3:16:55.280]  well he's talking and you're referring to 2nd Timothy 4 which is a scripture
[3:16:55.280 --> 3:16:59.360]  reference written over 2,000 years ago about the last days that it'd be
[3:16:59.360 --> 3:17:03.600]  terrible times for Christian servants that because people would be lovers of
[3:17:03.600 --> 3:17:06.480]  themselves which is obvious in fact all the way down here the reason I almost
[3:17:06.480 --> 3:17:10.760]  didn't get here on time today is because people will drive in the fast lane 45
[3:17:10.760 --> 3:17:14.480]  miles an hour and they care nothing about who's behind them or who's worse they
[3:17:14.480 --> 3:17:18.680]  do it on purpose enjoying and peting that's it because it's my road it's
[3:17:18.680 --> 3:17:22.320]  about me don't pass me what are you gonna do for me how you gonna benefit me
[3:17:22.320 --> 3:17:25.840]  hey that's enough about me let's talk about you what do you think about me
[3:17:25.840 --> 3:17:30.560]  right that's that's everybody's attitude it's all about them and 2nd Timothy 4
[3:17:30.560 --> 3:17:34.680]  alludes to that very thing lovers of themselves lovers of money lovers of
[3:17:34.680 --> 3:17:39.560]  pleasure rather than lovers of God having a form of godliness but denying the
[3:17:39.560 --> 3:17:44.080]  power within and in other words they have this outward appearance they might
[3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:47.880]  wear a cross or a Christian t-shirt or they might have an actual nice they might
[3:17:47.880 --> 3:17:50.920]  act nice but then as soon as they get out of church on Sunday they're flipping
[3:17:50.920 --> 3:17:53.880]  people off and honking the horn and screaming at people and yelling at their
[3:17:53.880 --> 3:17:58.200]  kids there's no outward evidence of an inward conversion Jesus said you'll know
[3:17:58.200 --> 3:18:02.200]  them by their fruit in fact Alex you'll really get into this in the last days in
[3:18:02.200 --> 3:18:05.960]  Matthew 24 when Jesus laid out all the warning signs earthquakes pestilence
[3:18:05.960 --> 3:18:10.680]  famines wars rumors of wars and so on he started with one sign repeated at ten
[3:18:10.680 --> 3:18:14.320]  times he didn't repeat any other warning sign but this one do you know what it
[3:18:14.320 --> 3:18:19.120]  was no be careful no one deceive you because the deception will come that
[3:18:19.120 --> 3:18:23.440]  people be wolves and sheeps clothing false teachers false leaders false
[3:18:23.440 --> 3:18:28.080]  witnesses and so on over and over again that's what we see this big news you
[3:18:28.080 --> 3:18:32.000]  just broke what was it yesterday day before about the climate change scam and
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:35.720]  fraud and them admitting behind the scenes that they're fudging the numbers
[3:18:35.720 --> 3:18:39.480]  and changing things in order to perpetuate this agenda on the people we
[3:18:39.480 --> 3:18:42.320]  started covering that over the weekend it broke last week well it shouldn't
[3:18:42.320 --> 3:18:46.520]  surprise any of us I mean every time you pull back one more layer of the
[3:18:46.520 --> 3:18:49.680]  bureaucracy within this country you see corruption so that's it but I can't
[3:18:49.680 --> 3:18:54.640]  believe how bad it is it gets I can't even I mean I can't it boggles my mind
[3:18:54.640 --> 3:18:58.680]  they're this corrupt and they found this many evil people to serve them well man
[3:18:58.680 --> 3:19:03.400]  I tell you this much once again every aspect of our society has been captured
[3:19:03.400 --> 3:19:08.440]  by capitalist that not the good kind of capitalist who want to empower people to
[3:19:08.440 --> 3:19:12.840]  go farther and do more and accomplish more the pirates things but yeah pirates
[3:19:12.840 --> 3:19:16.560]  and plunderers people that just come in they come to kill still and destroy
[3:19:16.560 --> 3:19:20.600]  which is exactly what the Bible said the devil does so these people don't worship
[3:19:20.600 --> 3:19:25.160]  God no they worship Satan and I don't care what label look at Sodom and Gomorrah
[3:19:25.160 --> 3:19:29.680]  of evil the CPS comes and wants his kids well you know it's it's once again
[3:19:29.680 --> 3:19:34.600]  everywhere we turn come on Alex there well we'll get back after the break but
[3:19:34.600 --> 3:19:38.520]  only just come back with this one thought every aspect of our lives were
[3:19:38.520 --> 3:19:43.840]  entangled into a system of tyranny of injustice and a lack of liberty yeah and
[3:19:43.840 --> 3:19:47.880]  I've been interrupting with that but tell us the story of what happened in Dallas
[3:19:47.880 --> 3:19:51.560]  you cannot stand on a street corner and hand out tracks not unless you want to

[3:21:15.760 --> 3:21:20.400]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[3:21:20.400 --> 3:21:25.680]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[3:24:33.160 --> 3:24:37.080]  it all away I mean there is no comparison you're in a league oh stop it
[3:24:37.080 --> 3:24:40.640]  Rundis you are you are but you know that's actually true that actually makes
[3:24:40.640 --> 3:24:44.000]  me even more humble now I do a decent job sometime but it's only because I hate
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:46.680]  the tyranny now Darrell this is short segment long segment coming up we're
[3:24:46.680 --> 3:24:51.040]  take calls to and get into a host of issues tell the listeners exactly what
[3:24:51.040 --> 3:24:55.360]  happened to you in Dallas Texas with your first amendment hey pure and simple
[3:24:55.360 --> 3:24:58.760]  we went to the Texas State Fair with a you know a few couple hundred people
[3:24:58.760 --> 3:25:02.160]  right to pass out tracks talk to people minister to people and so on got
[3:25:02.160 --> 3:25:05.500]  permission from the assistant to the chief of police of Dallas prior to
[3:25:05.500 --> 3:25:09.040]  going out there recorded conversation so even get permission for your first
[3:25:09.040 --> 3:25:11.880]  amendment right well I just wanted to clear the because if it was just me no
[3:25:11.880 --> 3:25:15.280]  big no but you're me can being nice and yeah I'm trying to I'm trying to make
[3:25:15.280 --> 3:25:20.000]  sure that the true interpretation of Romans 13 you know that I do submit to
[3:25:20.000 --> 3:25:23.040]  authority that I do show them the respect that they deserve okay until
[3:25:23.040 --> 3:25:26.160]  they start violating the Miller well then I gotta obey God not men when they
[3:25:26.160 --> 3:25:30.080]  violate God's law and tell me I can't preach the gospel just like in China and
[3:25:30.080 --> 3:25:34.120]  other places where we're Christian or in Rome 1800 years ago right exactly so
[3:25:34.120 --> 3:25:38.240]  whatever the case is it's be nothing new to stand up for think about this it's
[3:25:38.240 --> 3:25:43.280]  the tyranny what happened 2,000 years ago 1800 years ago in Rome is now
[3:25:43.280 --> 3:25:46.020]  happening to Darrell Rundis in Dallas what's happened not just to Darrell
[3:25:46.020 --> 3:25:48.680]  Rundis but to hundreds and thousands look and I don't care if you're a
[3:25:48.680 --> 3:25:51.640]  Christian I don't care you know if you're just an activist you're an atheist
[3:25:51.640 --> 3:25:55.640]  whatever I believe in free speech I don't care if you're all for gay and
[3:25:55.640 --> 3:25:58.680]  lesbian rights you know as a Christian maybe I don't particularly agree with
[3:25:58.680 --> 3:26:03.120]  that but I would encourage you to exercise your right to free speech that's
[3:26:03.120 --> 3:26:06.160]  what this country would a lot of those groups want to shut down your speech and
[3:26:06.160 --> 3:26:09.680]  that's wrong finish the story I just keep marveling they're one by one the
[3:26:09.680 --> 3:26:13.960]  Texas State Fair officials round us up we come back to what's clearly public
[3:26:13.960 --> 3:26:18.360]  property outside the gates of the fair and they threaten to arrest us we
[3:26:18.360 --> 3:26:22.400]  negotiate we ultimately settle and we we leave okay and then we come back the
[3:26:22.400 --> 3:26:25.560]  next year they do the same thing so finally we filed suit against them and
[3:26:25.560 --> 3:26:30.400]  once again the key thing and then I'm gonna just skip fast forward we lost on
[3:26:30.400 --> 3:26:35.840]  the case and why the all our attorneys say that they hit us so hard with all
[3:26:35.840 --> 3:26:41.000]  these fees $29,000 I don't care who you are 29 grand is a lot of money for
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:46.160]  making some copies okay but the reason the judge enforced this and and and you
[3:26:46.160 --> 3:26:50.720]  know gave this judgment over to the Texas State Fair in the city of Dallas was
[3:26:50.720 --> 3:26:55.240]  because they're making an example out of me to chill other people's first
[3:26:55.240 --> 3:26:59.800]  amendment right so if you're out filming like in Pittsburgh with the whole you
[3:26:59.800 --> 3:27:02.880]  know thing that was going on at the G20 summit and when they arrested your guys
[3:27:02.880 --> 3:27:07.080]  believe me even if you you know go and fight and it's right and you know your
[3:27:07.080 --> 3:27:10.600]  you should be vindicated and you lose they're gonna start slapping you with
[3:27:10.600 --> 3:27:14.240]  all kinds of fines penalties court costs everything they can think oh yeah no no
[3:27:14.240 --> 3:27:18.480]  we're spending thousands to fight this right now absolutely and Rob do they
[3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:22.360]  say leave the area he leaves and they block him and say we're arresting you
[3:27:22.360 --> 3:27:26.280]  and they let the mainstream media go and they arrest Rob and they lie and then
[3:27:26.280 --> 3:27:30.400]  they they and they tortured Luke Radowski the military did that's what
[3:27:30.400 --> 3:27:34.040]  that's the level that this country has been degraded to they don't care about
[3:27:34.040 --> 3:27:37.920]  you they don't care about me wake up America wake up Christians in particular
[3:27:37.920 --> 3:27:42.080]  stand up for righteousness stand up for what's good and what's right and I mean
[3:27:42.080 --> 3:27:46.120]  I've got people telling me it's okay to taste a 10-year-old that's just sick man
[3:27:46.120 --> 3:27:50.560]  where is this country falling to notice that why is it all okay now but it wasn't
[3:27:50.560 --> 3:27:54.360]  okay in the past now give out some of the websites people can read about the
[3:27:54.360 --> 3:27:58.000]  court case well they could probably just pick it up online at Google if they just
[3:27:58.000 --> 3:28:01.120]  type in Darryl Rundus Texas State Fair the documents will come up because it's
[3:28:01.120 --> 3:28:05.360]  a matter of public record that the judge awarded $29,000 now keep in mind this
[3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:09.440]  isn't legal fees Alex this isn't money we paid to an attorney this is just for
[3:28:09.440 --> 3:28:14.720]  copies of the documents that we requested when we were doing discovery
[3:28:14.720 --> 3:28:18.520]  when you know you have each attorney has to you know exchange what information
[3:28:18.520 --> 3:28:23.720]  they have to enter into evidence so supposedly they made $29,000 worth of
[3:28:23.720 --> 3:28:27.040]  copies I think I got the wrong job man I gotta go work at Kinko's or something
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:30.800]  that's that's great money I mean how big a stack of documents was it but you know
[3:28:30.800 --> 3:28:34.160]  just a normal-sized box it wasn't that big a deal but they claim they had to
[3:28:34.160 --> 3:28:37.560]  scan them because they were old documents like a hundred dollars a page or
[3:28:37.560 --> 3:28:41.520]  something I don't know probably the typical government wages of about $200
[3:28:41.520 --> 3:28:45.760]  an hour yeah you know it is anyways it has nothing to do with the actual
[3:28:45.760 --> 3:28:52.520]  expense the actual cost to chill your free speech my free speech and anybody
[3:28:52.520 --> 3:28:55.840]  else that what are your lawyers saying you can do I mean I mean because you're
[3:28:55.840 --> 3:28:59.400]  saying this is precedent setting can't you do a judicial complaint on the judge
[3:28:59.400 --> 3:29:02.800]  well we'll do that we'll file the you know and not only the complaint but we'll
[3:29:02.800 --> 3:29:06.200]  file the appeal and then if we win on appeal then maybe we can get some of
[3:29:06.200 --> 3:29:10.320]  these you know these court costs back but ultimately I feel like it's this is
[3:29:10.320 --> 3:29:13.080]  gonna go to the Supreme Court because here's what people don't know if you
[3:29:13.080 --> 3:29:16.320]  look at the back of the ticket if you go to the Texas State Fair Alex you've
[3:29:16.320 --> 3:29:19.320]  been to the Texas State Fair yes everybody's been to the Texas State
[3:29:19.320 --> 3:29:23.280]  Fair that lives in Texas it's the biggest fair in the world okay but did
[3:29:23.280 --> 3:29:26.760]  you know you're allowed to ride the rides and drink the beer and eat the corn
[3:29:26.760 --> 3:29:31.040]  dogs but if you speak about religion or politics they'll escort you off their
[3:29:31.040 --> 3:29:35.120]  properties but right on the back of their ticket but you were on you were
[3:29:35.120 --> 3:29:39.520]  outside though we were at first on inside because it is Fair Park that's
[3:29:39.520 --> 3:29:43.160]  public property our funds built that place and they the Texas State Fair says
[3:29:43.160 --> 3:29:46.640]  oh we rented it out that makes it our private property but later you were
[3:29:46.640 --> 3:29:50.240]  outside yep absolutely that's when they threatened to arrest us even though we
[3:29:50.240 --> 3:29:54.240]  were doing what they asked us to do we're on the March the Empire's on the

[3:33:35.960 --> 3:33:40.960]  All right, we'll quit torturing the listeners, I apologize.
[3:33:40.960 --> 3:33:45.760]  Hey, you got to have, this is such a serious job, and you are the point on the tip of the
[3:33:45.760 --> 3:33:46.760]  spear.
[3:33:46.760 --> 3:33:48.000]  Oh boy, tip of the spear.
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:51.160]  You know, I coined that phrase for you, love that, don't you, I know, it's very fitting
[3:33:51.160 --> 3:33:53.600]  because it's true, but you know, you got to have some fun.
[3:33:53.600 --> 3:33:57.160]  Laughing is still a good medicine, you know, smiling and having a good time, and enjoying
[3:33:57.160 --> 3:33:59.080]  the freedoms that we still have left.
[3:33:59.080 --> 3:34:00.080]  It's a good thing.
[3:34:00.080 --> 3:34:03.200]  You know, you talked about how they're locking everything down, Mall of the America is going
[3:34:03.200 --> 3:34:07.360]  to have lockdown drills while people are in it, and now they're announcing metal detectors
[3:34:07.360 --> 3:34:11.720]  for malls, just everything's turning into a giant prison, you know, a couple hundred
[3:34:11.720 --> 3:34:16.480]  thousand die a year of car wrecks, tens of thousands from drowning, a couple dozen from
[3:34:16.480 --> 3:34:20.360]  mass shootings, but we've got to give up all our rights to stop the shooters and then
[3:34:20.360 --> 3:34:25.140]  actually locking things down with the cops outside will allow the shooters to kill masses
[3:34:25.140 --> 3:34:26.140]  of people.
[3:34:26.140 --> 3:34:27.600]  It's all just a big illusion.
[3:34:27.600 --> 3:34:31.240]  They spin it with the media to make people afraid.
[3:34:31.240 --> 3:34:35.440]  God hasn't given us a spirit of fear, but of love and of power and of sound mind.
[3:34:35.440 --> 3:34:39.560]  Think clearly, people, wake up and see the truth for what it really is.
[3:34:39.560 --> 3:34:40.920]  These people are mass illusionists.
[3:34:40.920 --> 3:34:45.360]  I mean, how many times have you ever been to a magic show and you swore the guy really
[3:34:45.360 --> 3:34:49.400]  levitated, the guy really walked on water, the guy really did these things that you saw
[3:34:49.400 --> 3:34:54.080]  with your own two eyes, and you could swear it was, it was true, it was real, it was tangible,
[3:34:54.080 --> 3:34:58.280]  it was something you could touch and smell and actually feel, but you know what, it was
[3:34:58.280 --> 3:35:02.880]  all just an illusion and that's really what's going on in this country with the evil empire.
[3:35:02.880 --> 3:35:07.680]  The fall of the republic is incrementally being increased over and over day by day.
[3:35:07.680 --> 3:35:11.640]  Because they know incrementalism is very hard to counter unless we have the long view of
[3:35:11.640 --> 3:35:14.160]  history and don't expect instant results.
[3:35:14.160 --> 3:35:19.120]  Just do the right thing, stand up, don't give up the field, don't give up, take action.
[3:35:19.120 --> 3:35:26.480]  And that's why last week, the house committee passes the bill, they have the 311 votes,
[3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:28.360]  it's going to pass the house for an audit of the Fed.
[3:35:28.360 --> 3:35:31.960]  The Senate may gut it later, but the idea has started.
[3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:34.600]  People know the Federal Reserve is the real power.
[3:35:34.600 --> 3:35:39.080]  These climate documents getting leaked, I mean, these are major victories showing our enemies
[3:35:39.080 --> 3:35:40.080]  are not invincible.
[3:35:40.080 --> 3:35:44.200]  Well, not just that, but you know, it's going to vindicate Ron Paul because so many of his
[3:35:44.200 --> 3:35:49.280]  skeptics and critics, they say, oh, Ron Paul, he's never passed any meaningful legislation
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:52.600]  his whole time in Congress, he's never really done anything impactful.
[3:35:52.600 --> 3:35:56.400]  Well, I tell you something, there's probably nothing, absolutely nothing more impactful
[3:35:56.400 --> 3:35:58.440]  we could do than to expose the Fed.
[3:35:58.440 --> 3:36:01.600]  Well, plus, he's always been there injecting real issues.
[3:36:01.600 --> 3:36:05.200]  Well, just bringing it to the surface, telling people the truth, look at all those congressional
[3:36:05.200 --> 3:36:09.400]  committees where he grills people about the truth, the Bernanke's of the world and so
[3:36:09.400 --> 3:36:10.400]  on, the Geithners.
[3:36:10.400 --> 3:36:15.680]  And at least, at least for the public's sake, can see and reveal the truth so that people
[3:36:15.680 --> 3:36:16.680]  may be able to see.
[3:36:16.680 --> 3:36:17.680]  That's another lie of the government.
[3:36:17.680 --> 3:36:19.920]  They say, we want politicians that can get things done.
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:21.280]  What run the guillotines faster?
[3:36:21.280 --> 3:36:25.160]  No, the founders wanted gridlock, they wanted to control government, not let it grow like
[3:36:25.160 --> 3:36:26.160]  a cancer.
[3:36:26.160 --> 3:36:30.440]  They want to go to a bunch of calls and get into other issues, but tell people about,
[3:36:30.440 --> 3:36:32.120]  about 10 and when you've now had the context.
[3:36:32.120 --> 3:36:37.280]  Yeah, Friday the 13th was the date we gave away the $20,000 and get this.
[3:36:37.280 --> 3:36:38.800]  You know how many calls it took me?
[3:36:38.800 --> 3:36:40.200]  One, just one call.
[3:36:40.200 --> 3:36:41.200]  I'm shocked.
[3:36:41.200 --> 3:36:45.040]  If I was a bet man, I would have lost because I would have told you probably to take 20,
[3:36:45.040 --> 3:36:50.760]  30, 40, 50 calls, but the very first woman, Beth Morris, hello, Beth, if you're listening,
[3:36:50.760 --> 3:36:55.400]  on the very first call named all 10 commandments in 17.5 seconds.
[3:36:55.400 --> 3:37:00.400]  She won $20,000 and to answer the two most common questions that I'm, I'm, I'm asked
[3:37:00.400 --> 3:37:01.400]  about this.
[3:37:01.400 --> 3:37:03.000]  Am I going to do it again?
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:04.000]  God willing.
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  Yeah.
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:06.000]  Next year we'll, we'll do it again.
[3:37:06.000 --> 3:37:07.360]  I can't say exactly when, but it was successful.
[3:37:07.360 --> 3:37:08.360]  It was wonderful.
[3:37:08.360 --> 3:37:09.360]  It was fun.
[3:37:09.360 --> 3:37:12.640]  It was just such a privilege and an honor and a pleasure to be a blessing to somebody.
[3:37:12.640 --> 3:37:17.480]  This woman had multiple sclerosis, had just lost her car, her husband hadn't worked for
[3:37:17.480 --> 3:37:18.480]  two years.
[3:37:18.480 --> 3:37:19.480]  I mean, we all know Ohio.
[3:37:19.480 --> 3:37:21.160]  Well, what a blessing for her.
[3:37:21.160 --> 3:37:22.160]  Yeah.
[3:37:22.160 --> 3:37:23.160]  Absolutely.
[3:37:23.160 --> 3:37:24.160]  And that was the person you randomly called.
[3:37:24.160 --> 3:37:29.440]  You know, we had a computer generate, you know, a name based on the people who had registered
[3:37:29.440 --> 3:37:30.440]  in the database.
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:31.440]  And we did it all live.
[3:37:31.440 --> 3:37:32.440]  There's a video.
[3:37:32.440 --> 3:37:36.680]  If you'll just go to prayer stop at YouTube or actually just go to the great news.com
[3:37:36.680 --> 3:37:40.640]  and right on the front page, you can watch the 10 minute video we did of the call with
[3:37:40.640 --> 3:37:41.640]  the winner.
[3:37:41.640 --> 3:37:44.680]  It was just such a blessing to even be a part of it, but I haven't seen the video.
[3:37:44.680 --> 3:37:46.400]  Does it start right at the beginning?
[3:37:46.400 --> 3:37:47.880]  It's probably in the middle of the call.
[3:37:47.880 --> 3:37:52.480]  I do a little preemptive stuff to tell people guys, cue it up to when he calls her to queue
[3:37:52.480 --> 3:37:53.480]  it up.
[3:37:53.480 --> 3:37:54.480]  We'll take about 20 seconds.
[3:37:54.480 --> 3:37:55.880]  Where do people go?
[3:37:55.880 --> 3:37:57.240]  The great news.com.
[3:37:57.240 --> 3:37:58.640]  The video is right on the front page.
[3:37:58.640 --> 3:38:02.520]  You've got so many sites and you've also given us you do news.com.
[3:38:02.520 --> 3:38:03.520]  We've been so busy.
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:04.640]  We haven't really done anything with it.
[3:38:04.640 --> 3:38:07.840]  People are uploading videos or getting posted, but we're going to be expanding that and using
[3:38:07.840 --> 3:38:09.400]  the great site you built for us.
[3:38:09.400 --> 3:38:10.400]  Yeah.
[3:38:10.400 --> 3:38:11.400]  And it's going to be powerful.
[3:38:11.400 --> 3:38:15.840]  In fact, I believe God's going to use it in a mighty way, Alex, to be that platform,
[3:38:15.840 --> 3:38:17.440]  that voice of the people that we're going to do it.
[3:38:17.440 --> 3:38:18.960]  I promise where you built it.
[3:38:18.960 --> 3:38:19.960]  You gave it to us.
[3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:24.560]  We're so limited on staff and stuff going on and now the guys need that two hour long
[3:38:24.560 --> 3:38:25.560]  coffee breaks.
[3:38:25.560 --> 3:38:26.560]  I'm just joking.
[3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:30.600]  We're going to, no, no, no, I've actually got to hire somebody just to manage that
[3:38:30.600 --> 3:38:32.400]  site alone because it's going to be such a great site.
[3:38:32.400 --> 3:38:33.400]  It is a great site.
[3:38:33.400 --> 3:38:34.400]  You do news.com.
[3:38:34.400 --> 3:38:35.880]  Fire out some of the other sites.
[3:38:35.880 --> 3:38:38.480]  Well, the brand new thing, that's the answer to the second question.
[3:38:38.480 --> 3:38:39.480]  Darrell, what are you going to do now?
[3:38:39.480 --> 3:38:40.480]  What are you doing next?
[3:38:40.480 --> 3:38:45.560]  And the big thing I'm doing now is a brand new ministry that we call prayer stop.
[3:38:45.560 --> 3:38:50.000]  It's real simple, straightforward, and very effective, but inexpensive outreach for churches
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:51.000]  and ministries.
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:54.400]  I mean, come on, let's think about it with the economy and all the loss of.
[3:38:54.400 --> 3:38:55.920]  You're the guy that pioneered.
[3:38:55.920 --> 3:39:02.240]  You come in and get a free t-shirt or a gift card at the HEB or at the Safeway if they'll
[3:39:02.240 --> 3:39:03.640]  sign up for a newspaper.
[3:39:03.640 --> 3:39:08.200]  If you've ever seen a guy in a store, retailer, grocery store at a show, a fair festival event,
[3:39:08.200 --> 3:39:12.040]  hawken newspapers, trying to get you to sign up for subscription, give you a free gift card
[3:39:12.040 --> 3:39:17.000]  or a t-shirt or something in exchange for a new sign up for subscription, I started that
[3:39:17.000 --> 3:39:18.000]  about 20 years ago.
[3:39:18.000 --> 3:39:22.760]  And now I'm taking that same concept to the streets and we're going to set up what we
[3:39:22.760 --> 3:39:23.760]  call prayer stops.
[3:39:23.760 --> 3:39:26.880]  They're little portable kiosks that people can take wherever they go.
[3:39:26.880 --> 3:39:29.200]  They can set them up at bus stops or train stops.
[3:39:29.200 --> 3:39:33.600]  They can set them up at the post office out on the crosswalk in front of the school.
[3:39:33.600 --> 3:39:37.120]  They may not let people pray in school, but we can set up a prayer stop right on the street
[3:39:37.120 --> 3:39:40.080]  corner outside that school and start praying for those kids.
[3:39:40.080 --> 3:39:45.440]  Look, the Bible's clear on this, if my people who are called by my name would humble themselves
[3:39:45.440 --> 3:39:50.320]  and turn from their wicked ways, I would hear their prayers from heaven and I'd heal their
[3:39:50.320 --> 3:39:51.320]  land.
[3:39:51.320 --> 3:39:52.960]  So our hope and our faith isn't in politics.
[3:39:52.960 --> 3:39:54.480]  We can't trust politics there.
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:39:57.280]  They're constantly lying and cheating and stealing and manipulating.
[3:39:57.280 --> 3:39:59.120]  But if you change people individually.
[3:39:59.120 --> 3:40:00.120]  That's it.
[3:40:00.120 --> 3:40:04.960]  Our hope is in God working in the hearts, minds, and lives of men and women because, look,
[3:40:04.960 --> 3:40:08.800]  real true Christians, people like you and me, not false Christians, not pretenders but
[3:40:08.800 --> 3:40:11.280]  contenders will stand up for righteousness.
[3:40:11.280 --> 3:40:14.400]  Like Paul said, they'll have nothing to do with the evil deeds done in darkness.
[3:40:14.400 --> 3:40:15.600]  They'll expose them.
[3:40:15.600 --> 3:40:17.080]  And that's what good Christians do.
[3:40:17.080 --> 3:40:18.720]  They can't stand to be around tyranny.
[3:40:18.720 --> 3:40:19.960]  They can't stand evil.
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:22.280]  They will stand up for what's good and what's true and what's right.
[3:40:22.280 --> 3:40:24.440]  Well, I don't even claim to be a good Christian.
[3:40:24.440 --> 3:40:28.360]  I'm actually ashamed of a lot of things I've done, bad thoughts I have in things, but at
[3:40:28.360 --> 3:40:30.360]  least I have a conscience.
[3:40:30.360 --> 3:40:34.760]  So many other people, I mean, I think being good is just even having a con, being aware.
[3:40:34.760 --> 3:40:37.040]  I mean, most people aren't even concerned.
[3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:40.200]  Well, you're alluding to some more of the end times prophecies where they talked about
[3:40:40.200 --> 3:40:43.280]  seared consciences, where people's conscience would just disappear.
[3:40:43.280 --> 3:40:47.080]  And finally, they'd be so evil, so wicked that God would finally turn them over to do
[3:40:47.080 --> 3:40:48.360]  what ought not to be done.
[3:40:48.360 --> 3:40:49.680]  They'd reach a point of no return.
[3:40:49.680 --> 3:40:50.680]  They'd hit the edge.
[3:40:50.680 --> 3:40:51.680]  Is that the ultimate sin?
[3:40:51.680 --> 3:40:52.680]  No.
[3:40:52.680 --> 3:40:55.920]  That would be the blasphemy of the Holy Spirit to be the only sin that, according to the
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:40:56.920]  Bible, that can't be forgiven.
[3:40:56.920 --> 3:40:57.920]  And what is that?
[3:40:57.920 --> 3:41:04.560]  Well, technically, it's to say, well, I have no belief whatsoever in that Jesus Christ
[3:41:04.560 --> 3:41:09.160]  was the Son of God, or that the Holy Spirit exists, that that power of God, that spirit
[3:41:09.160 --> 3:41:11.040]  of God, can entwell men.
[3:41:11.040 --> 3:41:14.080]  And does that only happen if it's coming down on you and then you refuse it?
[3:41:14.080 --> 3:41:15.080]  Well, I don't know.
[3:41:15.080 --> 3:41:18.080]  I don't like to get into all that theology and semantics because I'm not God.
[3:41:18.080 --> 3:41:19.480]  That's pretty heavy stuff, though.
[3:41:19.480 --> 3:41:20.480]  It is.
[3:41:20.480 --> 3:41:23.480]  It's about as deep theological of thinking as you can probably get.
[3:41:23.480 --> 3:41:26.840]  And everybody has their own personal perspectives and views on those kind of things.
[3:41:26.840 --> 3:41:31.760]  I know God and Jesus holds the keys to heaven and hell, and hey, I've surrendered to the
[3:41:31.760 --> 3:41:32.760]  foot of that cross.
[3:41:32.760 --> 3:41:36.240]  I've said, I'm sorry for my sins, I've lied, I've cheated, I've stolen, I've done bad
[3:41:36.240 --> 3:41:37.240]  things.
[3:41:37.240 --> 3:41:38.240]  I mean, let's face it.
[3:41:38.240 --> 3:41:39.240]  We all have a sense of justice.
[3:41:39.240 --> 3:41:43.040]  That's why you every day are on air combating the evil and the wickedness and the tyranny
[3:41:43.040 --> 3:41:44.040]  in the world.
[3:41:44.040 --> 3:41:48.920]  What's the Bible passage about if somebody says there is no truth, run from them?
[3:41:48.920 --> 3:41:50.680]  I mean, people know there's a truth.
[3:41:50.680 --> 3:41:51.680]  People know there's a...
[3:41:51.680 --> 3:41:52.680]  We know.
[3:41:52.680 --> 3:41:54.200]  In fact, the word conscience, con means with.
[3:41:54.200 --> 3:41:55.200]  Science means knowledge.
[3:41:55.200 --> 3:41:56.200]  With knowledge, conscience.
[3:41:56.200 --> 3:42:00.880]  So every time we lie or steal or lust or get angry or whatever without cause, we know it's
[3:42:00.880 --> 3:42:01.880]  wrong.
[3:42:01.880 --> 3:42:05.040]  And that's why no man will be with an excuse on the day they die and they stand before
[3:42:05.040 --> 3:42:06.040]  God.
[3:42:06.040 --> 3:42:07.040]  They can't say, oh God, I'm so sorry.
[3:42:07.040 --> 3:42:08.040]  It was wrong.
[3:42:08.040 --> 3:42:09.040]  I didn't know it was wrong to lie.
[3:42:09.040 --> 3:42:10.040]  I didn't know it was wrong to steal.
[3:42:10.040 --> 3:42:11.040]  I didn't know it was wrong to do these things.
[3:42:11.040 --> 3:42:12.960]  No, we know right from wrong.
[3:42:12.960 --> 3:42:18.360]  Even in the deepest, most darkest jungles of Africa, people inherently know it's wrong
[3:42:18.360 --> 3:42:19.960]  to sleep with another man's wife.
[3:42:19.960 --> 3:42:21.680]  It's wrong to steal from your neighbor.
[3:42:21.680 --> 3:42:23.320]  It's wrong to kill somebody.
[3:42:23.320 --> 3:42:26.800]  In fact, people that live in a cannibalistic society have to be taught.
[3:42:26.800 --> 3:42:27.800]  They have to be brainwashed.
[3:42:27.800 --> 3:42:29.360]  Same thing we do with our soldiers, right?
[3:42:29.360 --> 3:42:30.360]  We train them.
[3:42:30.360 --> 3:42:31.360]  We send them to boot camp.
[3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:32.360]  We take out.
[3:42:32.360 --> 3:42:34.840]  We kill the conscience, cremation of care, if you will.
[3:42:34.840 --> 3:42:40.040]  We kill the conscience so that then they can go and do the things that evil men do without
[3:42:40.040 --> 3:42:41.840]  having to be convicted by that conscience.
[3:42:41.840 --> 3:42:45.800]  So yeah, your conscience is a good thing and you ought to listen to it more often.
[3:42:45.800 --> 3:42:48.520]  If everybody would, maybe they'd be a little more kinder, a little more kinder.
[3:42:48.520 --> 3:42:52.840]  Going off the Ten Commandments, it's thou shalt not murder is the real, I mean, defending
[3:42:52.840 --> 3:42:53.840]  yourself is okay.
[3:42:53.840 --> 3:42:55.040]  No, self-defense is not murder.
[3:42:55.040 --> 3:42:58.760]  There's a big difference between thou shalt not kill, which is the most commonly way it's
[3:42:58.760 --> 3:42:59.760]  quoted.
[3:42:59.760 --> 3:43:01.240]  And that's why defensive war is the only good war.
[3:43:01.240 --> 3:43:02.240]  That's right.
[3:43:02.240 --> 3:43:03.360]  That's why our forefathers knew that.
[3:43:03.360 --> 3:43:07.320]  We were never to go out and invade other countries and in station ourselves in those
[3:43:07.320 --> 3:43:08.320]  countries.
[3:43:08.320 --> 3:43:09.320]  No.
[3:43:09.320 --> 3:43:13.040]  If attacked, we had the proper right to defend ourselves and defend our liberty, our freedom,
[3:43:13.040 --> 3:43:14.040]  our country.
[3:43:14.040 --> 3:43:15.040]  And then it feels good.
[3:43:15.040 --> 3:43:16.040]  It does feel good.
[3:43:16.040 --> 3:43:18.400]  But it would feel horrible to go out and just start bullying somebody.
[3:43:18.400 --> 3:43:19.400]  No.
[3:43:19.400 --> 3:43:22.120]  And in fact, unless you're weak, you know, the biggest bullies in school are usually the
[3:43:22.120 --> 3:43:23.280]  biggest cowards.
[3:43:23.280 --> 3:43:26.480]  And once they get knocked down on their butt, they give up quickly.
[3:43:26.480 --> 3:43:31.240]  And it's the same thing with this very, very vocal minority within this country.
[3:43:31.240 --> 3:43:35.760]  If the majority, the people that outnumber, the people they're supposedly serving would
[3:43:35.760 --> 3:43:40.760]  finally wake up, rise up, speak up, never shut up or give up, man, this whole country
[3:43:40.760 --> 3:43:42.880]  could change like that.
[3:43:42.880 --> 3:43:47.440]  But the newer lord has been very good with all these glitter bug fake preachers to make
[3:43:47.440 --> 3:43:48.440]  everything look bad.
[3:43:48.440 --> 3:43:51.320]  Hey man, they just keep dangling stuff in front of the left hand.
[3:43:51.320 --> 3:43:55.200]  They know Satan knows his whole system has been set up on the 10th commandment.
[3:43:55.200 --> 3:43:56.720]  Thou shalt not covet.
[3:43:56.720 --> 3:44:00.000]  See the first of all 10 commandments you always break is thou shalt not covet.
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:02.600]  Before you steal, you'll covet the item you take.
[3:44:02.600 --> 3:44:07.440]  Before you lie, you'll covet your own self preservation and not paying the consequences
[3:44:07.440 --> 3:44:08.960]  of telling the truth and so on.
[3:44:08.960 --> 3:44:10.120]  We always covet first.
[3:44:10.120 --> 3:44:13.120]  We look at the neighbor's house, their car, their wife, their things.
[3:44:13.120 --> 3:44:16.000]  We say, I want that and we'll sell our souls to get it.
[3:44:16.000 --> 3:44:17.120]  And the system knows that.
[3:44:17.120 --> 3:44:18.120]  Those who worship...
[3:44:18.120 --> 3:44:20.920]  Well, I mean, I commit a lot of sins to them very worldly, but ever since I was a little
[3:44:20.920 --> 3:44:24.120]  kid, the one good thing I'm strong at is I don't covet.
[3:44:24.120 --> 3:44:29.240]  I'm not that envious of a person, somebody's got a beautiful wife, girlfriend, nice house.
[3:44:29.240 --> 3:44:30.400]  I'm happy for them.
[3:44:30.400 --> 3:44:35.200]  I never realized how powerful coveting and envy was with the general public.
[3:44:35.200 --> 3:44:37.280]  They're like ravenous with it.
[3:44:37.280 --> 3:44:39.040]  And then it leads to idolatry, right?
[3:44:39.040 --> 3:44:42.480]  That's why American Idol is the number one show on television today.
[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:44.520]  Because they see that and say, I want that for me.
[3:44:44.520 --> 3:44:45.600]  I want to be the celebrity.
[3:44:45.600 --> 3:44:46.600]  I want to be the star.
[3:44:46.600 --> 3:44:48.000]  I want to be the center of tension.
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:49.000]  I...
[3:44:49.000 --> 3:44:50.000]  Me...
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:51.000]  Me...
[3:44:51.000 --> 3:44:52.680]  And to be clear, I'm not saying having nice things is bad.
[3:44:52.680 --> 3:44:56.400]  We're saying, we're saying putting it up there is the idol, worshiping it.
[3:44:56.400 --> 3:44:58.200]  It's okay to own stuff.
[3:44:58.200 --> 3:45:00.120]  Just don't let the stuff own you.
[3:45:00.120 --> 3:45:01.760]  There's a big difference between the two.
[3:45:01.760 --> 3:45:02.760]  Exactly.
[3:45:02.760 --> 3:45:05.240]  Like, I wouldn't do anything immoral for something.
[3:45:05.240 --> 3:45:06.800]  I wouldn't cheat anyone for something.
[3:45:06.800 --> 3:45:10.680]  Like, I have all these enemies who I could destroy, who I know information about.
[3:45:10.680 --> 3:45:15.960]  And a few times, even trying to defend myself, I've almost, almost burned them and I can't
[3:45:15.960 --> 3:45:17.920]  make myself even do that.
[3:45:17.920 --> 3:45:22.640]  And I don't understand that rule, where even though the worldly it seems right, I just
[3:45:22.640 --> 3:45:23.640]  can't do it.
[3:45:23.640 --> 3:45:27.520]  Well, it's funny you alluded to that because that's exactly the culture that we're living
[3:45:27.520 --> 3:45:28.520]  in today.
[3:45:28.520 --> 3:45:30.160]  If it feels good, if it feels right, do it.
[3:45:30.160 --> 3:45:31.160]  It's okay.
[3:45:31.160 --> 3:45:33.320]  And that stems from a Lester Crowley's book of the law.
[3:45:33.320 --> 3:45:37.080]  The most wicked and evil man of his day said, there's only one law.
[3:45:37.080 --> 3:45:40.600]  And it's polar opposite of God's law, and that's do without will.
[3:45:40.600 --> 3:45:42.080]  Do without will should be the whole of law.
[3:45:42.080 --> 3:45:46.280]  If you want to separate a country, a person from God, the fastest way to do it is to get
[3:45:46.280 --> 3:45:48.080]  them to do their own will.
[3:45:48.080 --> 3:45:51.880]  When you forget God's will for your life and for this world and for this planet, and you
[3:45:51.880 --> 3:45:55.640]  start to do your own will and do whatever you want to do, it'll ultimately lead to evil.
[3:45:55.640 --> 3:45:56.640]  All right.
[3:45:56.640 --> 3:46:00.640]  I want to talk to Brad, Keith, Anthony, Anthony and John, quick calls, but first, let's go
[3:46:00.640 --> 3:46:08.320]  to thegreatnews.com and there is part of the video where Daryl calls the lady who it turned
[3:46:08.320 --> 3:46:13.000]  out has serious health problems, was going bankrupt, the computer randomly generates
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:14.000]  it.
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:15.000]  You have that on the screen.
[3:46:15.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  And I want you to know something too.
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:17.000]  I put her on the spot.
[3:46:17.000 --> 3:46:18.000]  I mean, right from the beginning.
[3:46:18.000 --> 3:46:19.000]  I'm like, okay, is this Beth?
[3:46:19.000 --> 3:46:20.000]  Okay, great.
[3:46:20.000 --> 3:46:21.000]  Here.
[3:46:21.000 --> 3:46:22.000]  Here we go.
[3:46:22.000 --> 3:46:23.000]  Are you ready?
[3:46:23.000 --> 3:46:24.000]  Go.
[3:46:24.000 --> 3:46:26.080]  So, you know, she didn't have time to pull out a list of the 10 commandments or, you know,
[3:46:26.080 --> 3:46:27.080]  something like that.
[3:46:27.080 --> 3:46:29.280]  I mean, I really got right to it right as soon as I got here we go.
[3:46:29.280 --> 3:46:30.520]  Here's the video and audio of that.
[3:46:30.520 --> 3:46:32.640]  Make sure you bring it up.
[3:46:32.640 --> 3:46:33.640]  No cuts.
[3:46:33.640 --> 3:46:34.640]  Here we go.
[3:46:34.640 --> 3:46:35.640]  Okay, we're recording.
[3:46:35.640 --> 3:46:36.640]  Yes, we are.
[3:46:36.640 --> 3:46:37.640]  We got that.
[3:46:37.640 --> 3:46:38.640]  Here we go.
[3:46:38.640 --> 3:46:41.640]  We're going to call her at one, three, four.
[3:46:41.640 --> 3:46:47.000]  You know, it's amazing is I get her answering machine first and I start to leave her a message
[3:46:47.000 --> 3:46:52.280]  kind of taunting her, hey, you missed the call kind of thing and she picks up this is live
[3:46:52.280 --> 3:46:53.720]  unedited is why you hear the ringing.
[3:46:53.720 --> 3:46:55.720]  Here we go.
[3:46:55.720 --> 3:46:57.720]  Yeah.
[3:46:57.720 --> 3:47:04.600]  Couldn't think of a better person winning.
[3:47:04.600 --> 3:47:09.480]  No, I prayed before we took this call and God perfectly prepared this person.
[3:47:09.480 --> 3:47:10.920]  No two ways about it.
[3:47:10.920 --> 3:47:13.680]  First call first and it's a lady who's really needed.
[3:47:13.680 --> 3:47:17.480]  Yeah, I got an answer and she, hi, Beth.
[3:47:17.480 --> 3:47:20.280]  This is Daryl Rundus with 10andwin.com.
[3:47:20.280 --> 3:47:23.440]  Today's the day we give away $20,000.
[3:47:23.440 --> 3:47:27.920]  I hate to tell you this, but I was calling to give you your chance to show us the law
[3:47:27.920 --> 3:47:30.440]  in order in 20 seconds or less.
[3:47:30.440 --> 3:47:31.440]  Hello.
[3:47:31.440 --> 3:47:33.160]  Hi, is that there?
[3:47:33.160 --> 3:47:34.160]  Yes.
[3:47:34.160 --> 3:47:38.400]  Hey, Beth, this is Daryl Rundus with 10 and win and I wanted to get you to learn or get
[3:47:38.400 --> 3:47:40.760]  to list the law and order in 20 seconds or less.
[3:47:40.760 --> 3:47:41.760]  Are you ready to go?
[3:47:41.760 --> 3:47:42.760]  Oh my gosh.
[3:47:42.760 --> 3:47:43.760]  Are you ready?
[3:47:43.760 --> 3:47:44.760]  Yes.
[3:47:44.760 --> 3:47:45.760]  We got to go now.
[3:47:45.760 --> 3:47:46.760]  Set, go.
[3:47:46.760 --> 3:47:52.760]  No other gods before me, no idols, no blasphemy, remember the Sabbath, keep it holy, honor
[3:47:52.760 --> 3:48:00.760]  your father and mother, do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not lie,
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:02.760]  do not covet.
[3:48:02.760 --> 3:48:03.760]  Yay.
[3:48:03.760 --> 3:48:07.760]  You know how long that took?
[3:48:07.760 --> 3:48:11.760]  I don't have any idea.
[3:48:11.760 --> 3:48:17.760]  Yeah, it was less than 20 seconds, so you didn't have to do it in 20 seconds and you
[3:48:17.760 --> 3:48:18.760]  did it in 17.
[3:48:18.760 --> 3:48:20.760]  Congratulations, you won.
[3:48:20.760 --> 3:48:21.760]  You're so mean.
[3:48:21.760 --> 3:48:23.760]  No, I didn't kid you about anything like that.
[3:48:23.760 --> 3:48:27.760]  Congratulations, you were the first person I called.
[3:48:27.760 --> 3:48:29.760]  You've got to be kidding me.
[3:48:29.760 --> 3:48:30.760]  She's like speechless.
[3:48:30.760 --> 3:48:33.760]  Congratulations, $20,000.
[3:48:33.760 --> 3:48:34.760]  Let me ask you the obvious question.
[3:48:34.760 --> 3:48:36.760]  What are you going to do with the money?
[3:48:36.760 --> 3:48:41.760]  Well, oh my goodness, this is such an absolute prayer.
[3:48:41.760 --> 3:48:43.760]  I'm going to pay off credit cards.
[3:48:43.760 --> 3:48:50.760]  I'm going to buy me a car because, you know, a used car because our car just went out like
[3:48:50.760 --> 3:48:56.760]  two days ago and I've been on the internet looking for trying to find something that
[3:48:56.760 --> 3:48:58.760]  we could afford.
[3:48:58.760 --> 3:49:01.760]  Well, now you can afford up to $20,000 car.
[3:49:01.760 --> 3:49:02.760]  That is just wonderful.
[3:49:02.760 --> 3:49:03.760]  That's amazing.
[3:49:03.760 --> 3:49:09.760]  People can watch the full video at thegreatnews.com and again, she has a serious medical problem.
[3:49:09.760 --> 3:49:13.760]  Well, on the 10-minute version on our site there, it doesn't go into all that, but then
[3:49:13.760 --> 3:49:17.760]  right below the video, there's a place to download the full, unedited, extended version
[3:49:17.760 --> 3:49:21.760]  where you get to all the behind-the-scenes stuff, a lot more conversation with her after
[3:49:21.760 --> 3:49:22.760]  she had won the money and so on.
[3:49:22.760 --> 3:49:23.760]  But she has, what does she have?
[3:49:23.760 --> 3:49:24.760]  Multiple sclerosis.
[3:49:24.760 --> 3:49:27.760]  See, that is a perfect person to get the $20,000.
[3:49:27.760 --> 3:49:29.760]  Not just that, Alex, but you know what she did?
[3:49:29.760 --> 3:49:34.760]  She did what I originally intended this to be all about, which was a way for people that
[3:49:34.760 --> 3:49:37.760]  might be filled with fear to get up and to go out and to start talking to people about
[3:49:37.760 --> 3:49:38.760]  the things of God.
[3:49:38.760 --> 3:49:43.760]  She made her own little billboard up that said, name 10, win $20,000 and she would get people
[3:49:43.760 --> 3:49:47.760]  over and talk to them about the commandments and then the things of God, how we'd all broken
[3:49:47.760 --> 3:49:50.760]  those commandments, but that God loved us so much, he sent his son to die.
[3:49:50.760 --> 3:49:52.760]  And then she won after that?
[3:49:52.760 --> 3:49:54.760]  Yeah, and so she's doing all this stuff.
[3:49:54.760 --> 3:49:55.760]  She's paying it for it.
[3:49:55.760 --> 3:49:56.760]  She's not coveting the cash.
[3:49:56.760 --> 3:50:00.760]  She's out there using it as a way to minister to other people and to talk to other people
[3:50:00.760 --> 3:50:01.760]  and to pay it forward.
[3:50:01.760 --> 3:50:05.760]  And God blessed her faithfulness by having her win the money.
[3:50:05.760 --> 3:50:06.760]  Unbelievable.
[3:50:06.760 --> 3:50:08.760]  And that's, hey, we serve her mighty God.
[3:50:08.760 --> 3:50:11.760]  That's almost like the widow's might story.
[3:50:11.760 --> 3:50:12.760]  Absolutely.
[3:50:12.760 --> 3:50:13.760]  She gave all she had.
[3:50:13.760 --> 3:50:20.260]  She was down to the very little bit and I guarantee you the $20,000 I gave wasn't even close to
[3:50:20.260 --> 3:50:21.260]  all that she gave.
[3:50:21.260 --> 3:50:22.760]  Well, that almost makes me cry, Darrell.
[3:50:22.760 --> 3:50:23.760]  I've got tears in my eyes.
[3:50:23.760 --> 3:50:25.760]  Yeah, it touches me too.
[3:50:25.760 --> 3:50:29.760]  And I'm glad that, I mean, the hundreds of people called and signed up for her, right?
[3:50:29.760 --> 3:50:30.760]  Thousands.
[3:50:30.760 --> 3:50:31.760]  Yeah, thousands.
[3:50:31.760 --> 3:50:35.760]  And then the first call, the very first one, is a lady who really, really needs it.
[3:50:35.760 --> 3:50:36.760]  Yeah.
[3:50:36.760 --> 3:50:38.760]  And she almost didn't get it because she, I got the answering machine.
[3:50:38.760 --> 3:50:39.760]  How about that?
[3:50:39.760 --> 3:50:40.760]  Isn't that amazing?
[3:50:40.760 --> 3:50:41.760]  I just love it.
[3:50:41.760 --> 3:50:43.760]  God, God works in amazing ways.
[3:50:43.760 --> 3:50:47.760]  We're gonna take a few final calls from at least Brad and Keith and Anthony in the final
[3:50:47.760 --> 3:50:48.760]  segment.
[3:50:48.760 --> 3:50:53.760]  Darrell run this here where there's always great to having in studio and we just really,
[3:50:53.760 --> 3:50:56.760]  really appreciate the great work you're doing, Darrell, and the support you've given our
[3:50:56.760 --> 3:50:57.760]  operation as well.
[3:50:57.760 --> 3:51:00.760]  Stay with us.
[3:51:00.760 --> 3:51:06.760]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:51:06.760 --> 3:51:11.760]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:51:11.760 --> 3:51:16.760]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[3:51:16.760 --> 3:51:17.760]  you to have.
[3:51:17.760 --> 3:51:18.760]  It's true.
[3:51:18.760 --> 3:51:22.760]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:51:22.760 --> 3:51:26.760]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[3:51:26.760 --> 3:51:30.760]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[3:51:30.760 --> 3:51:34.760]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[3:51:34.760 --> 3:51:37.760]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[3:51:37.760 --> 3:51:42.760]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:51:42.760 --> 3:51:46.760]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:51:46.760 --> 3:51:47.760]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[3:51:47.760 --> 3:51:52.760]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[3:51:52.760 --> 3:51:53.760]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[3:52:03.760 --> 3:52:07.760]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[3:52:07.760 --> 3:52:10.760]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[3:52:10.760 --> 3:52:15.760]  Is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home?
[3:52:15.760 --> 3:52:19.760]  We have turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress,
[3:52:19.760 --> 3:52:21.760]  and they really are calling the shots.
[3:52:21.760 --> 3:52:26.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:26.760 --> 3:52:30.760]  Full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[3:52:30.760 --> 3:52:34.760]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[3:52:34.760 --> 3:52:36.760]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:52:36.760 --> 3:52:39.760]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:52:39.760 --> 3:52:43.760]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:52:43.760 --> 3:52:45.760]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[3:52:45.760 --> 3:52:50.760]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the republic.
[3:52:50.760 --> 3:52:55.760]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.

[3:53:25.760 --> 3:53:29.760]  the vast majority of the time, I can show you how to completely erase it
[3:53:29.760 --> 3:53:33.760]  so you pay no taxes on what the IRS will consider to be taxable income.

[3:54:07.760 --> 3:54:12.760]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell, but I've been seen with Farrah.
[3:54:12.760 --> 3:54:18.760]  I've never been with anything less than a dime, so fine.
[3:54:18.760 --> 3:54:28.760]  Well, Daryl, this hour has blasted past us, and it's always wonderful to have you in studio with us.
[3:54:28.760 --> 3:54:30.760]  On your show, where women are, you know, sad.
[3:54:30.760 --> 3:54:32.760]  Oh, come on. Knock it off. Stop it.
[3:54:32.760 --> 3:54:36.760]  Ron Paul, Jesse Ventura, Charlie Sheen.
[3:54:36.760 --> 3:54:39.760]  By the way, people just joined us. Charlie couldn't come on today.
[3:54:39.760 --> 3:54:43.760]  He called me this morning. I just got another email from him.
[3:54:43.760 --> 3:54:47.760]  He was super sick. He apologized to the winner of 20 minutes with the president.
[3:54:47.760 --> 3:54:51.760]  He just said, just got up. This is the newest one. Just came in 10 minutes ago.
[3:54:51.760 --> 3:54:57.760]  And it says, so sorry. I have a really bad last few days, particularly this morning.
[3:54:57.760 --> 3:55:00.760]  Sunday is a lot better than Monday. I'll call you after show.
[3:55:00.760 --> 3:55:04.760]  So Sunday, he's probably on. He's always been on when he said he'd be on.
[3:55:04.760 --> 3:55:08.760]  I mean, I talked to him this morning. He was just, well, I got a message at 5 a.m. his time.
[3:55:08.760 --> 3:55:11.760]  He was just like, dude, I can barely get out of bed. I don't know if I can do it.
[3:55:11.760 --> 3:55:12.760]  And so...
[3:55:12.760 --> 3:55:14.760]  Hey, Alex, can I do something? I know we only...
[3:55:14.760 --> 3:55:17.760]  It sounds like you couldn't have your contest when your wife's appendix burst.
[3:55:17.760 --> 3:55:20.760]  That's it. You know, hey, things happen, but God works all things together for the good.
[3:55:20.760 --> 3:55:23.760]  I know that I've come to see it. But hey, we got five minutes left.
[3:55:23.760 --> 3:55:27.760]  I know you promised you'd take some calls, but man, before we go, I want to ask you a favor.
[3:55:27.760 --> 3:55:29.760]  Just on air because no...
[3:55:29.760 --> 3:55:32.760]  We'll just go, hey, we'll do five minutes overdrive so we can take these calls.
[3:55:32.760 --> 3:55:34.760]  The problem is there with Genesis, though.
[3:55:34.760 --> 3:55:37.760]  Okay. Take the calls and then if you'll stick around for five minutes after,
[3:55:37.760 --> 3:55:39.760]  I'm going to pray for Alex live on there.
[3:55:39.760 --> 3:55:41.760]  Okay. And we'll do that in the overdrive.
[3:55:41.760 --> 3:55:44.760]  infowars.com on the audio streams. You've got to go to those streams to hear it.
[3:55:44.760 --> 3:55:48.760]  Or prismplanet.tv. Brad in Canada, you're on the air. Go ahead, Brad.
[3:55:48.760 --> 3:55:52.760]  Hey, good afternoon, guys. First of all, Alex Hall, the Republic of the Masterpiece, buddy.
[3:55:52.760 --> 3:55:55.760]  Just a masterpiece. And Darrell, I got to salute you, buddy.
[3:55:55.760 --> 3:55:57.760]  That was just... That was unbelievable.
[3:55:57.760 --> 3:56:01.760]  I got shivers up my spine listening to that.
[3:56:01.760 --> 3:56:02.760]  Well, praise God.
[3:56:02.760 --> 3:56:04.760]  I did too because it was so real.
[3:56:04.760 --> 3:56:08.760]  Yeah. Well, thank God, really. It's his money. I just get the privilege of spending it.
[3:56:08.760 --> 3:56:09.760]  Absolutely.
[3:56:09.760 --> 3:56:14.760]  There's not a heck of a lot of talk up here in Canada about the fraud of emails.
[3:56:14.760 --> 3:56:19.760]  So I started really hammering the talk radio stations today.
[3:56:19.760 --> 3:56:23.760]  And I don't know what's going on down there, but I just find more and more...
[3:56:23.760 --> 3:56:26.760]  People just... It amazed me.
[3:56:26.760 --> 3:56:29.760]  I mean, there's a saying that people sometimes stumble across the truth,
[3:56:29.760 --> 3:56:31.760]  but pick themselves up if nothing ever happened. It seems like...
[3:56:31.760 --> 3:56:33.760]  More than that. They love the lie.
[3:56:33.760 --> 3:56:36.760]  They giggle themselves about being deceived and heard.
[3:56:36.760 --> 3:56:39.760]  If they revel in it. I don't know why. It's a spirit.
[3:56:39.760 --> 3:56:41.760]  Well, Tammy and I were talking about that on the drive down,
[3:56:41.760 --> 3:56:43.760]  that in Second Thessalonians, and if you...
[3:56:43.760 --> 3:56:45.760]  I don't care if you're Christian or not, go read it for yourself.
[3:56:45.760 --> 3:56:49.760]  It's a perfect description of what we're seeing that God pours out a great cup of delusion
[3:56:49.760 --> 3:56:51.760]  that people may believe the lie.
[3:56:51.760 --> 3:56:55.760]  And that's what we see. People are just delusional when you give them the cold, hard facts, the truth.
[3:56:55.760 --> 3:56:58.760]  The world government is being announced by the world government.
[3:56:58.760 --> 3:57:02.760]  We got Gordon Brown in front of Congress a few months ago talking about a world government
[3:57:02.760 --> 3:57:05.760]  and now is the best time ever to implement this world government.
[3:57:05.760 --> 3:57:07.760]  People are ready for it. And then you mention it to people.
[3:57:07.760 --> 3:57:10.760]  They don't even want to hear about it. They don't even want to know.
[3:57:10.760 --> 3:57:12.760]  They're blissfully ignorant.
[3:57:12.760 --> 3:57:15.760]  Wow, that's a great point. So like when you call Canadian radio,
[3:57:15.760 --> 3:57:18.760]  they just say it doesn't exist or what's happening.
[3:57:18.760 --> 3:57:21.760]  Well, one of the hosts down here in the Toronto station, he's pretty good,
[3:57:21.760 --> 3:57:23.760]  and he's been a skeptic of the whole thing.
[3:57:23.760 --> 3:57:25.760]  As a matter of fact, he had David Suzuki on his station,
[3:57:25.760 --> 3:57:31.760]  and when Suzuki was asked what he thought about the fact that the science wasn't complete,
[3:57:31.760 --> 3:57:33.760]  Suzuki got up and left the studio.
[3:57:33.760 --> 3:57:35.760]  I mean, it just shows what an athlete is.
[3:57:35.760 --> 3:57:37.760]  Yeah, they boycott any questioning.
[3:57:37.760 --> 3:57:42.760]  Suzuki calls us maggots that have to be dealt with.
[3:57:42.760 --> 3:57:45.760]  Human life is maggots. No, he's a maggot.
[3:57:45.760 --> 3:57:48.760]  Well, if you know what, if people would just look at their actions
[3:57:48.760 --> 3:57:51.760]  instead of listening to their words, their actions would speak so loudly,
[3:57:51.760 --> 3:57:53.760]  people wouldn't hear what they say.
[3:57:53.760 --> 3:57:56.760]  Because it's just like being a kid when you don't get your way.
[3:57:56.760 --> 3:57:58.760]  I'm going to go home. I'm going to take my toys.
[3:57:58.760 --> 3:58:00.760]  I don't want to play with you anymore because you don't want to play by my rules.
[3:58:00.760 --> 3:58:01.760]  That's what they do.
[3:58:01.760 --> 3:58:05.760]  Brad, we're out of time, and I apologize to Keith Anthony, Anthony John.
[3:58:05.760 --> 3:58:12.760]  You know what, if just these callers want to call 888-201-2244-888-201-2244,
[3:58:12.760 --> 3:58:14.760]  we'll do 10 minutes of overdrive.
[3:58:14.760 --> 3:58:16.760]  And I got to get home and take care of my wife because she's sick.
[3:58:16.760 --> 3:58:17.760]  And I wanted to hang out, Darryl.
[3:58:17.760 --> 3:58:19.760]  I hope she's going to get better soon.
[3:58:19.760 --> 3:58:21.760]  I'm going to bring her some colloidal silver at home.
[3:58:21.760 --> 3:58:24.760]  I've been drinking this right here the last two days, knocked it out for me.
[3:58:24.760 --> 3:58:26.760]  No kidding, it really has.
[3:58:26.760 --> 3:58:28.760]  It was like sipping this earlier. In fact, I'm going to have some right now.
[3:58:28.760 --> 3:58:31.760]  Retransmission starts now. Great job, crew.
[3:58:31.760 --> 3:58:36.760]  We have unbelievable guests coming up, so stay with us on that as well.
[3:58:36.760 --> 3:58:59.760]  We're going to overdrive right now in FullWars.com.
[3:59:06.760 --> 3:59:13.760]  We'll see you in the next video.
[3:59:36.760 --> 3:59:58.760]  We'll see you in the next video.
[4:00:06.760 --> 4:00:35.760]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[4:00:35.760 --> 4:00:38.760]  We are back live in a special overdrive.
[4:00:38.760 --> 4:00:42.760]  And I told just those few listeners that have been holding 888-201-2244.
[4:00:42.760 --> 4:00:44.760]  We'll take a few calls for the sins.
[4:00:44.760 --> 4:00:46.760]  Okay, Darryl, you want to pray for me on there?
[4:00:46.760 --> 4:00:48.760]  Alex, I know there's a lot of people they call in and they say,
[4:00:48.760 --> 4:00:49.760]  hey, we're praying for you.
[4:00:49.760 --> 4:00:53.760]  But sometimes I think it's good that other people who are hearing right now,
[4:00:53.760 --> 4:00:55.760]  they're listening right now and overdrive,
[4:00:55.760 --> 4:00:58.760]  they can hear the kind of prayers we ought to be praying,
[4:00:58.760 --> 4:01:00.760]  at least in my mind or in my opinion for you.
[4:01:00.760 --> 4:01:02.760]  So if you would, I'm just going to pray for you.
[4:01:02.760 --> 4:01:04.760]  Father, thank you for saving us, Lord.
[4:01:04.760 --> 4:01:07.760]  Thank you for reaching your holy hand down from heaven and picking us up
[4:01:07.760 --> 4:01:09.760]  and putting our feet on a path of righteousness,
[4:01:09.760 --> 4:01:12.760]  a path of light, a path of wisdom,
[4:01:12.760 --> 4:01:15.760]  a path that denies the evil that's done in darkness and exposes it
[4:01:15.760 --> 4:01:18.760]  and stands up for what's true and what's good and what's right.
[4:01:18.760 --> 4:01:21.760]  You said that your Son and our Savior Jesus is the way,
[4:01:21.760 --> 4:01:23.760]  He's the truth, He's the life, and He certainly is.
[4:01:23.760 --> 4:01:25.760]  And let us look to Him as our example,
[4:01:25.760 --> 4:01:29.760]  not to fake and phony Christians, Lord, but to you and you alone.
[4:01:29.760 --> 4:01:32.760]  Lord, I pray that you'll put your holy hand upon Alex
[4:01:32.760 --> 4:01:34.760]  and on his wife and his family.
[4:01:34.760 --> 4:01:36.760]  You'll heal her even as we speak.
[4:01:36.760 --> 4:01:38.760]  Start to make her feel well even now.
[4:01:38.760 --> 4:01:42.760]  But Lord, I pray for all the staff members that are part of what I would call a ministry.
[4:01:42.760 --> 4:01:45.760]  I know they call this an info ward or a business,
[4:01:45.760 --> 4:01:48.760]  but Lord, we know this is the ministry you've called Alex to.
[4:01:48.760 --> 4:01:50.760]  So Lord, he is certainly a watchman on the wall.
[4:01:50.760 --> 4:01:54.760]  And I pray that you'll just continue to give him your words, your thought,
[4:01:54.760 --> 4:01:57.760]  your wisdom, your courage, your strength, your power, Lord,
[4:01:57.760 --> 4:02:01.760]  that may be able to run the race with perseverance that you've marked out for him.
[4:02:01.760 --> 4:02:03.760]  Lord, continue to guide him and strengthen him.
[4:02:03.760 --> 4:02:06.760]  Continue to keep him close to you and put that hedge of protection.
[4:02:06.760 --> 4:02:08.760]  Let no evil thing enter this office.
[4:02:08.760 --> 4:02:10.760]  Let no evil thing prosper against him.
[4:02:10.760 --> 4:02:11.760]  We love you.
[4:02:11.760 --> 4:02:14.760]  We thank you for doing these things, not because we're worthy,
[4:02:14.760 --> 4:02:16.760]  because we certainly aren't, but because you're willing,
[4:02:16.760 --> 4:02:18.760]  because you are the ultimate truth.
[4:02:18.760 --> 4:02:20.760]  You are the ultimate authority.
[4:02:20.760 --> 4:02:22.760]  You're the ultimate righteous dude.
[4:02:22.760 --> 4:02:23.760]  And we love you.
[4:02:23.760 --> 4:02:24.760]  And we praise you.
[4:02:24.760 --> 4:02:26.760]  And we thank you for loving us so much you died for us.
[4:02:26.760 --> 4:02:29.760]  What greater love than this than that a man lay down his life first friend.
[4:02:29.760 --> 4:02:31.760]  So Lord, we thank you for Alex.
[4:02:31.760 --> 4:02:35.760]  We thank you for the way he lays down his life every day, day in, day out,
[4:02:35.760 --> 4:02:38.760]  and make sacrifice for the benefit of us all.
[4:02:38.760 --> 4:02:42.760]  Let us all take inspiration from what he does and to get up and go out
[4:02:42.760 --> 4:02:45.760]  and make a difference in this cold, dark and dying world.
[4:02:45.760 --> 4:02:46.760]  We love you.
[4:02:46.760 --> 4:02:47.760]  We thank you again in Jesus' name.
[4:02:47.760 --> 4:02:48.760]  Amen.
[4:02:48.760 --> 4:02:49.760]  Amen.
[4:02:49.760 --> 4:02:50.760]  Well, thank you for that, Darryl.
[4:02:50.760 --> 4:02:52.760]  Let's take a few final calls here.
[4:02:52.760 --> 4:02:56.760]  And we should all pray for each other because if people can't tell,
[4:02:56.760 --> 4:02:59.760]  we're sliding into some very dark times, they're blind.
[4:02:59.760 --> 4:03:03.760]  Yeah, they're naked, wretched, poor and blind according to Jesus in the book
[4:03:03.760 --> 4:03:06.760]  of Revelation talking about the church of Laodicea.
[4:03:06.760 --> 4:03:07.760]  We're a lukewarm church, Alex.
[4:03:07.760 --> 4:03:08.760]  That's what we see.
[4:03:08.760 --> 4:03:11.760]  We're a bunch of people that if I guarantee if I ran into the church,
[4:03:11.760 --> 4:03:14.760]  and I would never do this, but if I ran into a church with an Uzi,
[4:03:14.760 --> 4:03:17.760]  and I said, everybody who's not ready to die for Christ,
[4:03:17.760 --> 4:03:20.760]  get up and get out of here because the rest of you, you're going to die.
[4:03:20.760 --> 4:03:23.760]  I guarantee you about nine out of 10 of them would run out of the church
[4:03:23.760 --> 4:03:24.760]  as fast as they could.
[4:03:24.760 --> 4:03:28.760]  And then I would turn to the believers, the ones who've held their ground.
[4:03:28.760 --> 4:03:31.760]  I'd say, hey, I didn't want a fellowship with a bunch of non-believer,
[4:03:31.760 --> 4:03:32.760]  fake Christians.
[4:03:32.760 --> 4:03:35.760]  Sorry I had to do that and put you through that, but I needed to make sure
[4:03:35.760 --> 4:03:36.760]  you were the real deal.
[4:03:36.760 --> 4:03:38.760]  And remember that girl at Columbine that wouldn't renounce?
[4:03:38.760 --> 4:03:39.760]  Absolutely.
[4:03:39.760 --> 4:03:40.760]  I mean, there were several of them.
[4:03:40.760 --> 4:03:43.760]  That was, most people don't realize this, but if you'll investigate the matter,
[4:03:43.760 --> 4:03:44.760]  you'll come to find out.
[4:03:44.760 --> 4:03:45.760]  They were Satanists.
[4:03:45.760 --> 4:03:47.760]  They were Satanists targeting Christians.
[4:03:47.760 --> 4:03:48.760]  They hated Christians.
[4:03:48.760 --> 4:03:52.760]  They hated God and they were against God and they loved all the wicked
[4:03:52.760 --> 4:03:53.760]  and evil that they could.
[4:03:53.760 --> 4:03:56.760]  People ask, how could they be Jewish but love Hitler?
[4:03:56.760 --> 4:03:57.760]  It's all evil.
[4:03:57.760 --> 4:03:58.760]  They loved evil.
[4:03:58.760 --> 4:04:01.760]  Look, man, when you cross that line, whatever it is for each of us,
[4:04:01.760 --> 4:04:05.760]  there's that line, when you finally cross it into the dark side, you know,
[4:04:05.760 --> 4:04:07.760]  it's much like the Star Wars episodes, right?
[4:04:07.760 --> 4:04:09.760]  I mean, there's the good and there's the evil.
[4:04:09.760 --> 4:04:12.760]  And when you finally cross that line, it starts with fear, you know,
[4:04:12.760 --> 4:04:15.760]  and then that fear turns to anger and that anger turns to hate
[4:04:15.760 --> 4:04:17.760]  and that hate turns to rage.
[4:04:17.760 --> 4:04:20.760]  I mean, it's like all the people fighting against the New World Order
[4:04:20.760 --> 4:04:22.760]  who are still listening right now on the show.
[4:04:22.760 --> 4:04:23.760]  I want to say something to you.
[4:04:23.760 --> 4:04:27.760]  If you're motive for what you're doing is any more, any less than love,
[4:04:27.760 --> 4:04:29.760]  you're going to end up faulting.
[4:04:29.760 --> 4:04:32.760]  You're going to end up getting frustrated or angry or mad.
[4:04:32.760 --> 4:04:34.760]  You've got to really care about this country.
[4:04:34.760 --> 4:04:36.760]  You've got to really love the people in this country.
[4:04:36.760 --> 4:04:38.760]  Those poor, innocent people who are, they're just blind.
[4:04:38.760 --> 4:04:39.760]  They're just blind.
[4:04:39.760 --> 4:04:40.760]  They just don't know any better.
[4:04:40.760 --> 4:04:42.760]  So don't get mad at the blind man.
[4:04:42.760 --> 4:04:44.760]  Just continue to persevere.
[4:04:44.760 --> 4:04:45.760]  Continue to persist.
[4:04:45.760 --> 4:04:46.760]  Continue to pursue those seeds.
[4:04:46.760 --> 4:04:47.760]  Absolutely.
[4:04:47.760 --> 4:04:48.760]  Anthony and Boston, you're on the air.
[4:04:48.760 --> 4:04:49.760]  Go ahead.
[4:04:49.760 --> 4:04:52.760]  How are you?
[4:04:52.760 --> 4:04:54.760]  Man, I got to tell you, the last segment has been really touching.
[4:04:54.760 --> 4:04:58.760]  You guys are really, you know, I'm not really a believer.
[4:04:58.760 --> 4:05:00.760]  And I mean, I was baptized when I was a Christian,
[4:05:00.760 --> 4:05:03.760]  but you know, I haven't gone to those places in a long time.
[4:05:03.760 --> 4:05:05.760]  So I just want to thank you guys for going there.
[4:05:05.760 --> 4:05:07.760]  It was kind of bringing me back.
[4:05:07.760 --> 4:05:10.760]  Hey Anthony, just, I don't mean to interrupt, but I got to tell you something.
[4:05:10.760 --> 4:05:12.760]  Dude, you don't have to go to church to be a Christian.
[4:05:12.760 --> 4:05:15.760]  In fact, there's probably more false Christians in church than there are real ones.
[4:05:15.760 --> 4:05:16.760]  You're right, man.
[4:05:16.760 --> 4:05:17.760]  It's really true.
[4:05:17.760 --> 4:05:19.760]  I mean, I just, you know, I have my conscience.
[4:05:19.760 --> 4:05:23.760]  I do the best I can every day and I listen to my conscience.
[4:05:23.760 --> 4:05:25.760]  Alex, how are you, man?
[4:05:25.760 --> 4:05:28.760]  I just wanted to say I'm a big fan of the show, by the way.
[4:05:28.760 --> 4:05:33.760]  I got to tell you, it's a nice break from the traveling press corps.
[4:05:33.760 --> 4:05:38.760]  Alex, the reason I'm calling you today is because of our contest entry to the
[4:05:38.760 --> 4:05:41.760]  20 Minutes with Charlie Sheen contest.
[4:05:41.760 --> 4:05:46.760]  Alex, we put in our time, all of so many resources, our hearts and souls,
[4:05:46.760 --> 4:05:50.760]  so many sleepless nights into the creation of this film, our film.
[4:05:50.760 --> 4:05:54.760]  And I know that you've been there, too, because I know you've made many films.
[4:05:54.760 --> 4:05:59.760]  We actually sent you a link to our film before the deadline.
[4:05:59.760 --> 4:06:05.760]  But because it wasn't on a YouTube or a blip.tv site, you guys were not able to
[4:06:05.760 --> 4:06:08.760]  embed our video that was posted on our server.
[4:06:08.760 --> 4:06:11.760]  Yeah, I mean, just to be clear, there's Kurt Nemo, and that's it,
[4:06:11.760 --> 4:06:16.760]  runninginfowars.com and Aaron, and if I was to hire more people,
[4:06:16.760 --> 4:06:19.760]  the whole show would turn into an infomercial, getting the money to pay for it.
[4:06:19.760 --> 4:06:21.760]  So it's kind of a catch-22.
[4:06:21.760 --> 4:06:26.760]  But I did see maybe 10 or so other videos that were posted before November 15th.
[4:06:26.760 --> 4:06:31.760]  We looked at them, and I haven't announced who the winners are yet.
[4:06:31.760 --> 4:06:35.760]  And I've, you know, Charlie chose first place.
[4:06:35.760 --> 4:06:37.760]  I've chosen second and third.
[4:06:37.760 --> 4:06:39.760]  The first place guy's been contacted.
[4:06:39.760 --> 4:06:43.760]  I was going to, you know, go ahead and announce those today, but he was sick.
[4:06:43.760 --> 4:06:46.760]  So I've talked to, well, Charlie's text messaged me while I was live.
[4:06:46.760 --> 4:06:48.760]  He says, Sunday is good for him.
[4:06:48.760 --> 4:06:51.760]  I've got to double-check schedules, do that.
[4:06:51.760 --> 4:06:54.760]  But everybody wins by putting it out.
[4:06:54.760 --> 4:06:56.760]  You know, Charlie and I aren't making any money.
[4:06:56.760 --> 4:06:57.760]  I know Charlie isn't, certainly.
[4:06:57.760 --> 4:06:59.760]  This will send people to infowars.com.
[4:06:59.760 --> 4:07:05.760]  Charlie's given $14,000 of his money just to get the 20 key points about the cover-up of 9-11,
[4:07:05.760 --> 4:07:08.760]  and the six of the 10 commission members did this.
[4:07:08.760 --> 4:07:13.760]  So I'm sorry if you feel like the six of the 10 commission members have come out and said it's a fraud.
[4:07:13.760 --> 4:07:17.760]  I'm sorry if you feel like we didn't do the best job posting and are looking at it.
[4:07:17.760 --> 4:07:20.760]  We are a ragtag organization.
[4:07:20.760 --> 4:07:22.760]  I fight just to stay on the air.
[4:07:22.760 --> 4:07:24.760]  That's not it.
[4:07:24.760 --> 4:07:25.760]  Are you there?
[4:07:25.760 --> 4:07:26.760]  Can you hear me?
[4:07:26.760 --> 4:07:27.760]  Okay.
[4:07:27.760 --> 4:07:30.760]  Well, I was misunderstanding because I got a lot of people sending me entries saying, hey, I didn't see this posted.
[4:07:30.760 --> 4:07:31.760]  Okay.
[4:07:31.760 --> 4:07:32.760]  Well, what's the point then, Anthony?
[4:07:32.760 --> 4:07:33.760]  You just want to plug where it's at.
[4:07:33.760 --> 4:07:35.760]  You want to plug where the video is?
[4:07:35.760 --> 4:07:36.760]  Oh, yeah.
[4:07:36.760 --> 4:07:37.760]  Absolutely.
[4:07:37.760 --> 4:07:38.760]  It's on BlipTV.
[4:07:38.760 --> 4:07:39.760]  It's called 20 Minutes.
[4:07:39.760 --> 4:07:43.760]  It's by Kronos Films, C-H-R-O-N-O-S Media.
[4:07:43.760 --> 4:07:52.760]  We asked your team for a confirmation of submission, and they said, because you can embed the video on your site,
[4:07:52.760 --> 4:07:58.760]  because we had it just hosted on our servers, and we made a webpage on our servers and sent you a link to our webpage.
[4:07:58.760 --> 4:08:00.760]  They said that wasn't enough.
[4:08:00.760 --> 4:08:04.760]  The video had to be on YouTube or Blip, and therefore, we'd make that.
[4:08:04.760 --> 4:08:07.760]  Sure. Well, who did you talk to? Because I think I've probably seen your video.
[4:08:07.760 --> 4:08:08.760]  I watched videos.
[4:08:08.760 --> 4:08:12.760]  Rob, it has a dream sequence.
[4:08:12.760 --> 4:08:13.760]  It has.
[4:08:13.760 --> 4:08:14.760]  There's a tazer.
[4:08:14.760 --> 4:08:16.760]  We built a whole story.
[4:08:16.760 --> 4:08:17.760]  Oh, no, I've seen that.
[4:08:17.760 --> 4:08:18.760]  That's great.
[4:08:18.760 --> 4:08:22.760]  Well, listen, send it again to Aaron at infowars.com, and we'll watch it.
[4:08:22.760 --> 4:08:23.760]  Okay.
[4:08:23.760 --> 4:08:25.760]  But I think I've seen it.
[4:08:25.760 --> 4:08:27.760]  I think Charlie's seen it.
[4:08:27.760 --> 4:08:30.760]  I mean, we've watched over 150 videos.
[4:08:30.760 --> 4:08:34.760]  The one with the tazer, and there's a dream sequence.
[4:08:34.760 --> 4:08:35.760]  Yes.
[4:08:35.760 --> 4:08:36.760]  And a whole story behind it.
[4:08:36.760 --> 4:08:37.760]  That's excellent.
[4:08:37.760 --> 4:08:41.760]  Listen, we're going to, right now, put you on hold.
[4:08:41.760 --> 4:08:47.760]  Jared is going to give you his internal email, and we'll do that.
[4:08:47.760 --> 4:08:48.760]  So, listen, I appreciate you.
[4:08:48.760 --> 4:08:51.760]  But again, any contest, it's not perfect.
[4:08:51.760 --> 4:08:55.760]  Like I told you, we'll solely choose who we're going to do, and what gets up there.
[4:08:55.760 --> 4:08:57.760]  But I'm going to put you on hold right now, Anthony.
[4:08:57.760 --> 4:08:58.760]  Thank you.
[4:08:58.760 --> 4:08:59.760]  Okay, great.
[4:08:59.760 --> 4:09:01.760]  Let's take a call now for Mike in California.
[4:09:01.760 --> 4:09:02.760]  Mike, you're on the air.
[4:09:02.760 --> 4:09:03.760]  Go ahead.
[4:09:03.760 --> 4:09:08.760]  Of all the years that I've listened to you, Alex, God bless, by the way, and of all the
[4:09:08.760 --> 4:09:10.760]  times for me to get on the air.
[4:09:10.760 --> 4:09:13.760]  I'm going to get on the air right now with my best friend, Dale Rundus.
[4:09:13.760 --> 4:09:15.760]  Hey, dude, this is the guy I was just telling you about.
[4:09:15.760 --> 4:09:17.760]  This is Mike Swigert.
[4:09:17.760 --> 4:09:21.760]  This is the guy I was just telling you about that heard me a few months back here on this
[4:09:21.760 --> 4:09:23.760]  show, and gave me a call.
[4:09:23.760 --> 4:09:24.760]  We got to talking.
[4:09:24.760 --> 4:09:26.760]  He radically has been saved.
[4:09:26.760 --> 4:09:28.760]  He surrendered at the foot of the cross.
[4:09:28.760 --> 4:09:29.760]  God has changed this guy.
[4:09:29.760 --> 4:09:30.760]  Oh, that's wonderful.
[4:09:30.760 --> 4:09:35.760]  I'll tell you guys one thing, and Alex brought this up earlier, and I'm a little bit nervous
[4:09:35.760 --> 4:09:36.760]  right now.
[4:09:36.760 --> 4:09:41.760]  But I was in a heavy metal band touring the country.
[4:09:41.760 --> 4:09:43.760]  I've done all those team things.
[4:09:43.760 --> 4:09:46.760]  Everybody says, oh, I did this at whatever.
[4:09:46.760 --> 4:09:54.760]  And just because you say you're a Christian, or you show up at church every Sunday, or
[4:09:54.760 --> 4:10:00.760]  because you walk at somebody else who's not following the Ten Commandments, it doesn't
[4:10:00.760 --> 4:10:01.760]  make you a Christian.
[4:10:01.760 --> 4:10:06.760]  What makes you a Christian is feeling the love inside of your heart that God puts there,
[4:10:06.760 --> 4:10:12.760]  and that you can only get from God and the energy that he pushes forward into our souls.
[4:10:12.760 --> 4:10:20.760]  And if it wasn't for Alex Jones, Darryl Rundus, and above all, Jesus Christ and God Almighty,
[4:10:20.760 --> 4:10:25.760]  my life would be in the crapper like it was eight months ago.
[4:10:25.760 --> 4:10:28.760]  I was touring the country, touring right through Austin.
[4:10:28.760 --> 4:10:29.760]  I was miserable.
[4:10:29.760 --> 4:10:33.760]  And that was after I had the radical change.
[4:10:33.760 --> 4:10:37.760]  The reason I was miserable is because I couldn't stand being out there.
[4:10:37.760 --> 4:10:43.760]  It'd be like if you were, if Alex, if you were there in a new group.
[4:10:43.760 --> 4:10:44.760]  In Congress.
[4:10:44.760 --> 4:10:45.760]  Alex for Congress.
[4:10:45.760 --> 4:10:46.760]  He'd drive you crazy.
[4:10:46.760 --> 4:10:51.760]  He'd be putting people in headlocks every day before session and giving them noogies.
[4:10:51.760 --> 4:10:52.760]  No, yeah.
[4:10:52.760 --> 4:10:53.760]  Are you kidding?
[4:10:53.760 --> 4:10:55.760]  I'm not saying that it's bad to be into anything.
[4:10:55.760 --> 4:11:01.760]  What I'm saying is Jesus Christ didn't come here to forgive us of our sins for us to go
[4:11:01.760 --> 4:11:03.760]  and point out other people's sins.
[4:11:03.760 --> 4:11:06.760]  And if you got, if everybody listened, I'm speaking to you.
[4:11:06.760 --> 4:11:09.760]  You have Christ in you, whether you believe it or not.
[4:11:09.760 --> 4:11:10.760]  He's around you.
[4:11:10.760 --> 4:11:13.760]  He wants to be, he wants to be part of your life.
[4:11:13.760 --> 4:11:19.760]  And if you think that being a Christian goes along with pointing fingers or showing up
[4:11:19.760 --> 4:11:23.760]  at a certain church or donating a certain amount of money to something like all a big
[4:11:23.760 --> 4:11:24.760]  hogwash.
[4:11:24.760 --> 4:11:28.760]  That's not really our audience, Mike, but very exciting to hear your story.
[4:11:28.760 --> 4:11:30.760]  We're going to have to end it there because I've got to wrap up.
[4:11:30.760 --> 4:11:31.760]  I've got to go somewhere.
[4:11:31.760 --> 4:11:37.760]  But no, the world does that with these fake stuff shirt Christians to make it look bad.
[4:11:37.760 --> 4:11:42.260]  You know, the thing is, Alex, look everywhere we look, everywhere we go, there's going to
[4:11:42.260 --> 4:11:43.260]  be good versus evil.
[4:11:43.260 --> 4:11:46.760]  I mean, every movie, there's always a parallel of good versus evil.
[4:11:46.760 --> 4:11:49.760]  There's always the champion, the hero and the bad guy, right?
[4:11:49.760 --> 4:11:51.840]  I mean, we have that sense within us.
[4:11:51.840 --> 4:11:53.560]  There is that duality within men.
[4:11:53.560 --> 4:11:57.760]  I mean, you ever wonder why it is people, human beings have the capacity to do so many
[4:11:57.760 --> 4:12:02.880]  wonderful, beautiful, amazing things and yet on the flip side to be so wicked, so hateful
[4:12:02.880 --> 4:12:04.960]  and so evil that they torture little kids.
[4:12:04.960 --> 4:12:10.760]  I mean, what causes that same man to be able to be so good on one end and so wicked and
[4:12:10.760 --> 4:12:11.960]  evil on the other?
[4:12:11.960 --> 4:12:15.720]  There's something deeper, something at a spiritual level and I think that's what Mike's trying
[4:12:15.720 --> 4:12:16.720]  to talk about.
[4:12:16.720 --> 4:12:18.320]  Well, Darrell, we're going to take it out of here.
[4:12:18.320 --> 4:12:19.320]  Really appreciate you coming in today.
[4:12:19.320 --> 4:12:20.320]  My pleasure.
[4:12:20.320 --> 4:12:23.040]  Once again, it's always good to have you in every few months and we appreciate your work.
[4:12:23.040 --> 4:12:24.040]  We appreciate all the listeners.
[4:12:24.040 --> 4:12:27.160]  I'll be back tomorrow, obviously back Sunday.
[4:12:27.160 --> 4:12:30.320]  Looks like Charlie Sheen is going to be on Sunday with the winner.
[4:12:30.320 --> 4:12:34.760]  And again, I've watched a lot of great videos, a lot of great entries.
[4:12:34.760 --> 4:12:39.200]  Everybody won who got involved in this and there's going to be a first place, second
[4:12:39.200 --> 4:12:41.040]  place and third place.
[4:12:41.040 --> 4:12:46.560]  He was sick today, so we couldn't do it today, but we'll be covering that either Sunday, Monday
[4:12:46.560 --> 4:12:47.560]  or Tuesday.
[4:12:47.560 --> 4:12:48.560]  Charlie sings Sunday.
[4:12:48.560 --> 4:12:49.560]  Looks like it's good for him.
[4:12:49.560 --> 4:12:50.720]  I've got to make some phone calls.
[4:12:50.720 --> 4:12:51.720]  Check on that.
[4:12:51.720 --> 4:12:53.120]  So we'll also see you Sunday.
[4:12:53.120 --> 4:12:55.160]  A great job crew.
[4:12:55.160 --> 4:12:56.160]  Excellent job.
[4:12:56.160 --> 4:13:00.640]  Retransmission starts now with the incredible climate gate, a death blow against the New
[4:13:00.640 --> 4:13:02.240]  World Order and their fraud.
[4:13:02.240 --> 4:13:28.920]  Take care, folks.
