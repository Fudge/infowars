[00:00.000 --> 00:18.720]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:18.720 --> 00:28.600]  tyranny well so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones
[00:28.600 --> 00:32.920]  we're gonna do things a little bit different on this live Sunday global
[00:32.920 --> 00:37.720]  transmission I'm going to open the phones up very very early in fact to the
[00:37.720 --> 00:43.240]  third segment of the broadcast hearing about 20 minutes Macron the youngest
[00:43.240 --> 00:47.560]  French president ever Napoleon in makeup is what they're calling him just
[00:47.560 --> 00:57.440]  one by 65 to 35 percent more than a 20 percent lead on Marie Le Pen now now
[00:57.440 --> 01:00.560]  here's the deal I looked at the scientific polls and I read the fine
[01:00.560 --> 01:08.240]  print on them how they carry the polls out the methodology as they call it and
[01:08.240 --> 01:13.280]  she was dead heat behind her ahead of him in polls that were giving him 5 10
[01:13.280 --> 01:19.040]  15 20 points depending on the poll so something has rotten in the state of the
[01:19.040 --> 01:24.800]  Parisian capital today now it's already basically midnight in Paris and they have
[01:24.800 --> 01:31.080]  announced that Macron has won the French presidency by an emphatic margin two
[01:31.080 --> 01:39.160]  things happened here either the French capitulated like it into Hitler oh you
[01:39.160 --> 01:43.480]  can search engine two weeks after the French lost to Hitler their main
[01:43.480 --> 01:47.480]  military stood down the Maginot line the British Expeditionary Force fled to
[01:47.480 --> 01:53.920]  the coast in Dunkirk most of the French military leadership just signed up as
[01:53.920 --> 01:57.880]  Nazis they done it before the war even started as covert agents and became the
[01:57.880 --> 02:01.680]  Vichy French down the south of France that's how France was run by the Nazis
[02:01.680 --> 02:05.760]  so quickly there wasn't a French resistance the last year or so the war
[02:05.760 --> 02:10.240]  so either France has just sold out to Germany again as Le Pen said you'll
[02:10.240 --> 02:14.280]  either be ruled by Mia's a woman or by Angela Merkel she said that last week's
[02:14.280 --> 02:19.280]  debate either they have just wanted to be trendy they want their pension funds
[02:19.280 --> 02:23.040]  they want to be ruled by the EU they just believe the lie of going along with
[02:23.040 --> 02:29.480]  the system and they're playing into the froggy pension for surrender or as the
[02:29.480 --> 02:33.720]  poll numbers show there was massive election fraud up on real Alex Jones on
[02:33.720 --> 02:37.560]  Twitter also on our prison planet live Twitter with Paul Watson we have the
[02:37.560 --> 02:40.600]  news and the reports there where they were sending out ballots with no Marie
[02:40.600 --> 02:47.160]  Le Pen on them all over the country so this just got announced the last 45
[02:47.160 --> 02:50.760]  minutes I mean I started doing live feeds earlier on Facebook and YouTube it
[02:50.760 --> 02:55.960]  was it was postulated that he was the winner with the landslide now he is the
[02:55.960 --> 03:03.320]  winner Emmanuel Macron Mr. Macron is now the winner this will be a day long
[03:03.320 --> 03:08.040]  remembered we've seen I mean there's photos you can Google these of him at
[03:08.040 --> 03:13.800]  the knees worshipping on his knees to Angela Merkel who's opened the borders
[03:13.800 --> 03:18.600]  up to the Islamist who is absolutely letting Europe be captured by Islam who
[03:18.600 --> 03:24.280]  is merging the EU with the Muslim countries this is incredible so that's
[03:24.280 --> 03:28.680]  all coming up I want to take your calls also I have challenged even go bear to
[03:28.680 --> 03:34.200]  be a man he's an actor posing as a reporter who poses as a satirist who
[03:34.200 --> 03:38.080]  then puts out ridiculous lies about myself President Trump and others and
[03:38.080 --> 03:42.480]  this is oh it's just satire but he says he's not satirical now as Stephen go
[03:42.480 --> 03:49.920]  bear hosting the CBS late show that was of course the barony previously of a
[03:49.920 --> 03:54.520]  actual good comedy genius with quite a bit of art to his brain but still a
[03:54.520 --> 03:59.320]  liberal and of course that was David Letterman but you have a pure actor up
[03:59.320 --> 04:03.200]  there who then hides behind being an actor and hides behind his hundred plus
[04:03.200 --> 04:10.760]  writers 19 of them full-time 17 of men where's the glass ceiling there and he
[04:10.760 --> 04:13.840]  won't debate me it's not that I need to go on a show he attacks me almost every
[04:13.840 --> 04:18.400]  night it's that there's such cowards they would never stand against a real man
[04:18.400 --> 04:23.240]  who this is a real real real man who doesn't have a teleprompter or writers
[04:23.240 --> 04:30.480]  he just sits there in these skits posing as if he's this big intellectual but
[04:30.480 --> 04:36.240]  he's not as bad as Bill Maher the weasel with that you know what eating
[04:36.240 --> 04:41.320]  bread on this face the turd gobbler the turd goblin
[04:41.320 --> 04:45.960]  Bill Maher well I've talked a lot of Hollywood folks at dinner they say that
[04:45.960 --> 04:49.520]  dinner he just brings me up he's been obsessed with me for over a decade and
[04:49.520 --> 04:54.620]  he's come out and accused the president of incest basically what have I said
[04:54.620 --> 05:00.880]  Bill Maher has sex with his family of course it's satire today we call it bone
[05:00.880 --> 05:05.160]  broth and for thousands of years our ancestors enjoyed its benefits before it
[05:05.160 --> 05:09.080]  became a loss to our modern diets a processed junk we are now introducing

[05:23.400 --> 05:27.120]  having to actually build civilization that are our superior ancestors and we
[05:27.120 --> 05:30.720]  need to do everything we can to recapture that everyone knew that you
[05:30.720 --> 05:34.400]  used all the parts of the animal you use the meat for sustenance the fat for
[05:34.400 --> 05:39.280]  cooking but you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full
[05:39.280 --> 05:42.640]  of minerals and Kiko factors to the marrow that produces the blood for the
[05:42.640 --> 05:47.400]  body this is the engine of the life essence I'm a long way from the caveman
[05:47.400 --> 05:51.320]  my ancestors were but I'm sure as hell trying to get back to that essence that

[06:18.080 --> 06:23.120]  air 20 years ago you never heard the term information war now it's all over
[06:23.120 --> 06:28.480]  the news an info wars with our amazing audience of activists and myself in the
[06:28.480 --> 06:33.680]  great crew is changing the world we're shattering the cultural morays of the
[06:33.680 --> 06:37.360]  establishment we're exposing their false paradigms we're exposing their
[06:37.360 --> 06:43.280]  tyranny their hypocrisy and so much more and so they are arrogantly following
[06:43.280 --> 06:47.640]  the path of tyrants throughout history like elephants going to a boneyard to
[06:47.640 --> 06:54.080]  die they are trying to censor us trying to shut us down and creating fact
[06:54.080 --> 07:04.080]  similes with the late show with Stephen Colbert and with Viacom and CBS and
[07:04.080 --> 07:10.880]  Showtime with shows like Homeland and Law and Order there are five national
[07:10.880 --> 07:16.600]  shows I know of that every week admittedly have an Alex Jones character on
[07:16.600 --> 07:22.640]  them who they admit as Alex Jones who they then put words in the mouth of
[07:22.640 --> 07:30.760]  racism of hate of disinformation that I never said or never did in their attempt
[07:30.760 --> 07:36.960]  to psychologically condition and inoculate with poison in the minds of
[07:36.960 --> 07:40.960]  the people before they ever get sent a link to one of our videos or one of our
[07:40.960 --> 07:45.240]  articles or one of our guests the system is scared of us showing not how
[07:45.240 --> 07:52.320]  powerful we are but how incredibly pathetic they are and that's why the
[07:52.320 --> 07:57.880]  teleprompter actors posing a satirist religious political propagandist the
[07:57.880 --> 08:02.800]  Bill Mars and the Stephen Colbert is the world attack me continually and attack
[08:02.800 --> 08:06.680]  the Liberty Movement continually because they know we're not reading off
[08:06.680 --> 08:10.880]  teleprompters they know we're true classical constitutional classical
[08:10.880 --> 08:15.480]  liberals paleo-conservatives the modern terms mean nothing they know we hold the
[08:15.480 --> 08:19.960]  light in the dark of the night and they're scared of that
[08:19.960 --> 08:29.400]  Macron the protege of a land in a landslide 65 to 35 has won the election
[08:29.400 --> 08:33.440]  when more than 20 points the 39 year old investment banker who works for the
[08:33.440 --> 08:37.760]  Rothschild family can't make that up who was trained in most of government
[08:37.760 --> 08:42.080]  elite school for politicians who is the right-hand man to fall on ran as an
[08:42.080 --> 08:50.960]  anti-establishment guy in a 13-way race in the runoff he was dead heat with
[08:50.960 --> 08:59.720]  Merkel his master he was course in the dead heat with the head of the
[08:59.720 --> 09:08.120]  nationalist populist party Marie Le Pen who said that you will either vote me in
[09:08.120 --> 09:10.960]  as your leader or you'll have a woman ruling you a woman's gonna be running
[09:10.960 --> 09:13.840]  this country friends one way or another she said last week you're either gonna
[09:13.840 --> 09:17.800]  be under me elected wise you're gonna be under the EU dictatorship run by
[09:17.800 --> 09:25.760]  Angela Merkel you can look at this two ways either massive peer pressure
[09:25.760 --> 09:28.640]  manipulated the French to go along with this and they're totally into style
[09:28.640 --> 09:34.600]  they're crippled by being seen as insiders after Napoleon's conditioning
[09:34.600 --> 09:39.440]  and Hitler's occupation which they gave into and actually welcomed in the
[09:39.440 --> 09:43.040]  French line the highways praising Hitler as he rolled into Paris when
[09:43.040 --> 09:46.520]  they've been learning for a while since Napoleon to roll over or get killed
[09:46.520 --> 09:51.840]  hell the Romans conquered France they called it gall so I guess for a couple
[09:51.840 --> 09:55.320]  thousand years they've been learning to grab their ankles but the French have
[09:55.320 --> 09:58.480]  great culture and you know under military control that they've been great
[09:58.480 --> 10:04.440]  soldiers but it's very very sad to see their servile feudal nature continue on
[10:04.440 --> 10:08.160]  but either they have their election stolen from them in the polls show
[10:08.160 --> 10:11.080]  that's probably what happened a lot of ballots went out without even having
[10:11.080 --> 10:16.720]  Marie Le Pen on them according to this or they were enslaved by propaganda and
[10:16.720 --> 10:19.680]  went along with it but either way you slice it they didn't go the way of
[10:19.680 --> 10:24.920]  Britain pulling out of the unelected EU they never voted to enter Obama told
[10:24.920 --> 10:28.560]  England you better vote to stay in the EU that of course blew up in their face
[10:28.560 --> 10:34.240]  and we call it the kiss of death but Obama endorsed Emmanuel Macron and it
[10:34.240 --> 10:40.320]  was the kiss of victory I guess from Obama what do you think's really
[10:40.320 --> 10:43.680]  happening here we've seen Iceland pull out of globalism we've seen Italy vote
[10:43.680 --> 10:47.840]  a few months ago five months ago to not be part of the EU expansion to give up
[10:47.840 --> 10:50.800]  their liberties we've seen a lot of other countries pulling out of globalism
[10:50.800 --> 10:54.640]  we see nationalism rising the globalists have said we've got to defeat Trump or
[10:54.640 --> 10:57.400]  he will overthrow our whole system it's not that Trump's perfect but he's
[10:57.400 --> 11:03.080]  actually becoming our new president he's actually becoming an American
[11:03.080 --> 11:06.400]  president he's actually transferring power back to the country he's actually
[11:06.400 --> 11:10.720]  acting like the president not taking orders from the TPP or the IMF or the
[11:10.720 --> 11:16.120]  World Bank or the World Trade Organization and Halan said six months ago
[11:16.120 --> 11:20.920]  that his job was to use the power of the government under national security to
[11:20.920 --> 11:24.680]  make sure Marie Le Pen didn't win when she was in the polls leading then they
[11:24.680 --> 11:29.560]  indicted her criminally for criticizing Islam that's illegal saying it's the
[11:29.560 --> 11:35.600]  biggest threats to France since Hitler invaded in 1941
[11:37.040 --> 11:41.720]  Halan in a slide dig that Le Pen says French president on a mission to fight
[11:41.720 --> 11:47.360]  rise of populism know this we've come from nobody knowing the Federal Reserve
[11:47.360 --> 11:51.360]  was far and owned in private ten years ago to most people knowing it we've
[11:51.360 --> 11:53.960]  come from people not knowing there's a private corporate global government
[11:53.960 --> 11:58.280]  called the New World Order to most people knowing it and seeing nationalism
[11:58.280 --> 12:02.440]  grow so as negative as a lot of this news is a lot of very very positive things
[12:02.440 --> 12:06.440]  are happening I want to take your calls on this subject and pick your brain in
[12:06.440 --> 12:11.920]  live time on that but also want to talk about actors posing as journalists who
[12:11.920 --> 12:18.600]  then fall back claiming their actors involved in satire with Bill Maher
[12:18.600 --> 12:23.200]  Stephen Colbert and people saying horrible lies about myself about
[12:23.200 --> 12:25.880]  President Trump you name it and now Bill Maher has come out will play the
[12:25.880 --> 12:30.680]  club here in a moment on this show Friday on HBO that's inherited by the
[12:30.680 --> 12:33.560]  mainstream media everywhere he's like the vice president of the Democratic
[12:33.560 --> 12:37.240]  Party he's the vice president of the shadow government the president Stephen
[12:37.240 --> 12:41.760]  Colbert that's their hope that's their God is a fake playing the part of
[12:41.760 --> 12:46.800]  another fake who's a satirist who won't tell you at satire saying that Ivanka
[12:46.800 --> 12:53.040]  Trump probably is more visual give sexual favors to her father and sexually
[12:53.040 --> 12:57.600]  services him and that she's their hope and what's the big message here Ivanka
[12:57.600 --> 13:03.520]  and Jared Kushner Democrats Jared Kushner's father an indicted kingpin
[13:03.520 --> 13:09.760]  his associates convicted prison time kingpins like his father for the stupid
[13:09.760 --> 13:17.000]  666 5th Avenue Address or whatever
[13:17.520 --> 13:22.320]  in love with themselves they go grovel of the left they do all this they go meet
[13:22.320 --> 13:25.560]  with Merkel they call for open borders and Muslim invasions and what do you
[13:25.560 --> 13:30.160]  get you get the media trashing you everywhere you get Bill Maher claiming
[13:30.160 --> 13:34.080]  you have sex with your father and Bill Maher can hide and say oh it's just satire
[13:34.080 --> 13:37.320]  no it's way to get him in the headlines and then say it's a joke later
[13:37.320 --> 13:42.520]  imagine if I said Barack Obama was having sex with his daughters I'm not
[13:42.520 --> 13:46.320]  saying that they'll probably run with it and say I did that's how deceptive MSM
[13:46.320 --> 13:55.680]  is but you think about that you think about all the different ways Stephen
[13:55.680 --> 13:59.400]  Colbert and his tuck Buckford character and other times he just attacks me
[13:59.400 --> 14:05.080]  openly and it said things I never said or never did and then the audience says
[14:05.080 --> 14:11.720]  oh well it's just comedy but it's not comedy when Stephen Colbert edited a
[14:11.720 --> 14:16.600]  tape three months ago where I said I'm not anti-gay and you edited out I'm not
[14:16.600 --> 14:22.640]  you had me say I'm anti-gay and then renting a house the woman came and
[14:22.640 --> 14:26.720]  banged on the door the next night said you work for Alex Jones don't you these
[14:26.720 --> 14:29.880]  guys are actually pretty liberal one of them said yeah and she said well you this
[14:29.880 --> 14:32.800]  guy's name's on the lease you're not welcome get out of here I'm throwing the
[14:32.800 --> 14:37.360]  other guy out totally illegal what she did but she didn't care I didn't say it
[14:37.360 --> 14:40.680]  but it didn't matter she wanted to involve herself in aggressive behavior
[14:40.680 --> 14:45.960]  watching Stephen Colbert and have somebody thrown off the air have
[14:45.960 --> 14:50.520]  somebody thrown out of their house and that's the thing they always want
[14:50.520 --> 14:54.120]  conservatives or libertarians or people that just aren't globalist traders to
[14:54.120 --> 14:57.920]  their country thrown out of their jobs thrown out of the air thrown off their
[14:57.920 --> 15:03.520]  shows but when it comes to them they just say oh it's just satire like if I
[15:03.520 --> 15:09.240]  said Stephen Colbert robs banks or Stephen Colbert is a child molester or
[15:09.240 --> 15:13.440]  Stephen Colbert is a member of the KKK but then later said oh it's satire they
[15:13.440 --> 15:17.240]  don't even say it satire when they say similar stuff about me they just are a
[15:17.240 --> 15:23.400]  satire show but their viewers don't know it so when we come back I'm gonna play
[15:23.400 --> 15:29.000]  the attack on Ivanka Trump and President Trump saying you know our savior was
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.240]  supposed to be Ivanka Trump but she's not gonna save him you know belittling a
[15:32.240 --> 15:36.240]  woman like she has no power but sexual power see why is it the left to be the
[15:36.240 --> 15:42.080]  most misogynistic vulgar hateful groups they want but then nobody else even has
[15:42.080 --> 15:45.480]  free speech because they're the anointed by Sumner Redstone they're the
[15:45.480 --> 15:49.760]  anointed by the big media they're the they're the anointed by HBO to do
[15:49.760 --> 15:53.680]  whatever they want because they're God we're the little people they're the
[15:53.680 --> 15:56.600]  elites I'm Alex show spread the word about the transmission you are

[20:20.800 --> 20:29.920]  you can run on for a long time run on for a long time run on for a long time
[20:29.920 --> 20:38.160]  sooner or later you gotta cut you down so famous Hollywood stars can be caught

[20:44.960 --> 20:51.280]  stars come out and say let him come back to the US get rid of his sentence you

[20:55.000 --> 21:00.040]  stuff you can imagine pedophilia it all comes out nobody gets in trouble but if
[21:00.040 --> 21:06.640]  conservatives say that the NFL is trying to push black quarterbacks and make
[21:06.640 --> 21:11.960]  them succeed no matter what like Rush Limbaugh said they say for two years boy
[21:11.960 --> 21:16.960]  caught him he's got to be taken off the air when it's clearly just his opinion
[21:16.960 --> 21:21.120]  then they say that the Patriots are racist because a third of their team or
[21:21.120 --> 21:30.200]  whatever's white you know it's white supremacism or whatever totally insane
[21:30.600 --> 21:36.360]  but then you can have Bill Maher it's not as powerful on radio it's it's on
[21:36.360 --> 21:43.040]  television he he simulates of Anka Trump having sex with her father and says oh
[21:43.040 --> 21:48.480]  daddy oh daddy and it's super creepy it's pedophilic it's not just
[21:48.480 --> 21:56.560]  misogynistic in their own liberal terms but it's very very incessuous but
[21:56.560 --> 22:01.120]  that's okay see he can say kill people kill kids clear up the highway I want
[22:01.120 --> 22:05.640]  euthanasia but then when he says oh Alex Jones is evil and bad he doesn't
[22:05.640 --> 22:09.080]  believe the government's official story of Sandy Hook he says kids didn't die I'm
[22:09.080 --> 22:13.040]  not saying that I'm saying I don't believe a word comes out of their mouths
[22:13.040 --> 22:17.760]  oh but then they're the great guardians of everybody and they care about the
[22:17.760 --> 22:22.400]  kids and oh Obamacare is being repealed and this new thing won't cover
[22:22.400 --> 22:26.600]  everybody Obamacare didn't either it's just bankrupting us they admit it's
[22:26.600 --> 22:31.000]  been to bankrupt our health care so nobody gets good health care it's meant
[22:31.000 --> 22:39.080]  to loot it Zeke a manual Jonathan Gruber said thank God you're so dumb thank

[23:58.600 --> 24:02.760]  have newsreels you can go to YouTube you can pull it up and the French waving
[24:02.760 --> 24:08.640]  and saying hi oh Hitler because the French love to capitulate they love to
[24:08.640 --> 24:12.080]  surrender they love to give up they learned under Napoleon they learned
[24:12.080 --> 24:15.580]  under William the Conqueror they learned they learned they're learned for a

[24:41.480 --> 24:44.000]  you can watch him once he gets to the big crowds they're out there
[24:44.000 --> 24:49.800]  hiling Hitler and he goes in Tours at all two weeks after the Germans invaded
[24:49.800 --> 24:53.440]  they gave up because they'd already been sold out internally just like the EU and
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.880]  Merkel now rules Le Pen said you'll be ruled by a woman by me or you'll be
[24:58.880 --> 25:03.200]  ruled by Merkel another woman and they are the polls showed though that they
[25:03.200 --> 25:06.280]  were neck and neck I think they stole the election they wanted a big strong
[25:06.280 --> 25:10.240]  showing that nationalism's in trouble that it's gone it's all part of the
[25:10.240 --> 25:15.600]  arrogance of these people I'm gonna shoot a special report on that I mean
[25:15.600 --> 25:19.120]  that color footage color footage of Hitler in Paris you can type that in
[25:19.120 --> 25:25.960]  it's pretty amazing and the French hailing Hitler that's the Stockholm
[25:25.960 --> 25:29.960]  syndrome that's the mass submission
[25:33.880 --> 25:41.800]  now let's go ahead though and go to Bill Maher Bill Maher again you say oh
[25:41.800 --> 25:47.200]  it's just a joke oh he's just comedy everybody else gets fired for saying
[25:47.200 --> 25:50.240]  one-tenth of this can you imagine if a conservative talk show host or
[25:50.240 --> 25:56.160]  libertarian or anybody else got up on TV and said and Bill Maher acts like it's
[25:56.160 --> 25:59.480]  a talk show not comedy he has a comedy intro but it's a serious show but he
[25:59.480 --> 26:05.640]  hides behind that imagine if if I or you or anybody else had a national show and
[26:05.640 --> 26:11.120]  then got up there and said oh looks like one of Obama's daughters comes in the
[26:11.120 --> 26:15.720]  savior and says oh daddy let me have let me have sex with you that person be
[26:15.720 --> 26:21.520]  out the year in a day but it's okay because it's Bill Maher oh my gosh it's

[33:25.000 --> 33:34.040]  jones so france has voted 65 to 35 you believe that
[33:34.040 --> 33:39.400]  for immanuel macron who literally works for the Rothschild banking dynasty
[33:39.400 --> 33:43.640]  was groomed by halan the socialists who's super unpopular
[33:43.640 --> 33:47.560]  who's opened the borders up to muslims even worse
[33:47.560 --> 33:52.920]  he has landslided marina lapin if you believe that even though polls showed her
[33:52.920 --> 33:55.960]  in most polls ahead of him or dead heat or slightly behind
[33:55.960 --> 33:59.400]  i think it's fraud here there's evidence that's in the french news
[33:59.400 --> 34:04.440]  but what a resounding supposed defeat for nationalism
[34:04.440 --> 34:09.720]  and i guess coming up in another six years in 2022
[34:09.720 --> 34:13.240]  they'll just keep bringing more muslims in more burning cities
[34:13.240 --> 34:16.520]  tourism down by 80 they just are committing national
[34:16.520 --> 34:21.400]  suicide right now macron wins prince presidency i want to take your calls
[34:21.400 --> 34:24.520]  the toll free number is different on the weekend than it is weekdays
[34:24.520 --> 34:31.880]  my weekday shows 11 a.m to 3 p.m central this number is 877789 alex 87778925
[34:31.880 --> 34:37.080]  39 we're gonna go to john ab able shan robert jacob and others here pretty
[34:37.080 --> 34:39.480]  quickly
[34:39.800 --> 34:43.160]  and then later i'm going to do a little bit of a history lesson on the french
[34:43.160 --> 34:47.560]  standing down to the nazis their own military founding its own government in
[34:47.560 --> 34:51.480]  vici and that's why we hear france lost in two weeks
[34:51.480 --> 34:55.000]  they didn't lose they rolled over
[34:55.160 --> 34:59.400]  and the french are known as wimps since then they beat the germans in
[34:59.400 --> 35:03.480]  world war one more than 10 million people died
[35:03.480 --> 35:07.960]  you read about vici france all of it but this is either a rolling over to the
[35:07.960 --> 35:12.120]  eu and angela merkel or it's a rolling over just the
[35:12.120 --> 35:15.640]  government's so corrupt it stole the election
[35:16.040 --> 35:18.920]  i find it hard to believe that in scientific polls
[35:18.920 --> 35:23.880]  she was ahead many of them or dead he or slightly behind and now she loses
[35:23.880 --> 35:30.600]  25 to 25 points or so 35 to 65 and that's more than
[35:30.600 --> 35:35.160]  i mean that is amazing those stories are all up on info wars dot com
[35:35.160 --> 35:39.640]  right now and by the way it is an act of resistance
[35:39.640 --> 35:45.800]  to cnbc msnbc abc cbs all the major news channels lying about us every day
[35:45.800 --> 35:48.520]  saying horrible things about me that aren't true because we they know we're
[35:48.520 --> 35:52.520]  the resistance we're the americans exposing the global takeover the tpp
[35:52.520 --> 35:55.960]  the imf the world bank that trump in his first hundred plus days has done a good
[35:55.960 --> 35:59.560]  job battling but now he's starting to falter he
[35:59.560 --> 36:03.960]  can't get good people in dc we'll talk some about that
[36:03.960 --> 36:08.920]  but regardless nationalism is rising all over the world
[36:10.120 --> 36:13.960]  so there's a great awakening happening we should be very very positive
[36:13.960 --> 36:19.400]  the frustrating thing is that the fraud machines is going up on high so last
[36:19.400 --> 36:23.800]  week or early this week steven cobert said that
[36:23.800 --> 36:29.720]  donald trump is the vienna sausage holster
[36:30.280 --> 36:32.680]  of
[36:33.560 --> 36:38.200]  the president of russia that doesn't violate fcc rules
[36:38.200 --> 36:44.520]  but the fcc is investigating it so we have decided there's no free speech
[36:45.400 --> 36:48.520]  it's like there's this famous british actor that's being investigated in ireland
[36:48.520 --> 36:51.800]  he's an irish actor but lives in england because he came out and said man of god's
[36:51.800 --> 36:55.000]  really sure is a sadist he's being investigated for blasphemy
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.280]  we don't want to become the Islamist enforcers we're fighting do we
[37:00.280 --> 37:05.320]  but i said he shouldn't lose his job for that he's a satirist he's a comedian
[37:05.320 --> 37:09.400]  he can say that trumps the butt boy if he wants that's not attacking anybody
[37:09.400 --> 37:14.680]  that's not attacking some group but notice how we're already in the box
[37:14.680 --> 37:18.440]  if we say that steven cobert doesn't have the right to say what he wants
[37:18.440 --> 37:22.520]  well then we don't have the right if you want to be anti homosexual
[37:22.520 --> 37:26.440]  that's your issue if you want to be pro or neutral or tolerant
[37:26.440 --> 37:29.800]  that's your issue but we've now gotten the point where oh don't worry what he
[37:29.800 --> 37:33.400]  said is in homophobic so it's okay that he says that the
[37:33.400 --> 37:39.720]  president's engaging in oral sex on a foreign leader
[37:39.720 --> 37:43.560]  but what he meant by it clearly was saying he's an agent of putin
[37:43.560 --> 37:47.400]  he's a brown noser he's a butt boy it wasn't meant
[37:47.400 --> 37:50.440]  even in that but they expand it where can't have whiteboards
[37:50.440 --> 37:54.200]  can't have brown bags can't have synco to my parties at your high school or
[37:54.200 --> 37:56.600]  your friend because it's cultural appropriation
[37:56.600 --> 38:00.920]  it's total racism being inculcated to make us all a bunch of basket cases
[38:00.920 --> 38:03.800]  at each other's throats we're not learning reading writing arithmetic
[38:03.800 --> 38:07.080]  we're learning political correctness we're learning how to be paralyzed we're
[38:07.080 --> 38:10.040]  learning how to not have speech the colleges are the opposite of open
[38:10.040 --> 38:12.760]  free societies
[38:12.760 --> 38:16.280]  so i said don't take his free speech but
[38:16.280 --> 38:19.480]  see he's busy out saying he's glad bill or rally got fired
[38:19.480 --> 38:22.760]  he's out busy saying let's police other people's speech so that's what makes it
[38:22.760 --> 38:26.200]  so sick is that bill marr wants political correctness he wants free speech
[38:26.200 --> 38:30.200]  restrictions so does steven cobert except they
[38:30.200 --> 38:34.200]  they don't have to be under it and they hide behind it being satire
[38:34.200 --> 38:38.600]  as they pose as news reporters and claim they're not being satirical
[38:38.600 --> 38:42.440]  when they say that i don't know the name of my children or i'm a racist or
[38:42.440 --> 38:47.640]  i'm a homophobe or all these other lies they hide behind that
[38:47.640 --> 38:50.760]  but then when they do something that clearly could be construed as that oh
[38:50.760 --> 38:56.200]  it's okay because they're liberal they're allowed to have their free speech
[38:56.920 --> 39:02.360]  they're above the law they're the super class they're the elite
[39:02.360 --> 39:05.880]  i don't need to go on cobert's show to get famous or popular i'm already on it
[39:05.880 --> 39:09.320]  almost every night but it shows how there's teleprompters
[39:09.320 --> 39:12.440]  how it's all prescripted and how scared they are
[39:12.440 --> 39:16.040]  on a bill marr i mean i turned down the view last week i turned down
[39:16.040 --> 39:20.120]  charlie rosa's show last week because they weren't live they wanted to tape
[39:20.120 --> 39:23.560]  the view is bigger than cobert but the point is is that people
[39:23.560 --> 39:28.920]  oh you wish you were on cobert i'm on cobert a facsimile of me when he attacks
[39:28.920 --> 39:32.680]  you by name when he makes up what i've said is steven cobert which he claims
[39:32.680 --> 39:37.160]  isn't an actor which is an actor which is a persona then he says i'm fake and i
[39:37.160 --> 39:39.720]  say i'm an actor no video of me saying that
[39:39.720 --> 39:43.720]  they'll play clips of me in the news where i'm saying outrageous things as a
[39:43.720 --> 39:46.680]  character and they say oh he really means that i'm saying no
[39:46.680 --> 39:50.600]  i'm playing a character to illustrate things there just like steven cobert
[39:50.600 --> 39:55.640]  but what i stand for at the end of the day is sovereignty nationalism free market
[39:55.640 --> 40:01.000]  true capitalism religious freedom classical liberalism
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.760]  because those people that read off teleprompters and have a bunch of writers
[40:04.760 --> 40:08.040]  and who aren't real of course they want to say the real man
[40:08.040 --> 40:12.200]  alex jones let's turn the document cam on and scan the studio for folks
[40:12.200 --> 40:16.280]  there's a tv i'm looking at there's a computer there's another computer with
[40:16.280 --> 40:22.360]  calls coming in right over here to the right right there you've got
[40:22.360 --> 40:26.120]  the tv screens and you've got a call center here
[40:26.120 --> 40:30.360]  where i can take the calls that's what i have in here
[40:30.360 --> 40:35.800]  i don't have anything else in here in this little pocket old radio studio i've
[40:35.800 --> 40:38.760]  been in 11 years
[40:39.160 --> 40:41.880]  so there you go
[40:42.440 --> 40:45.880]  like let's try to it's up so high let's try to shoot to the window if we can
[40:45.880 --> 40:48.920]  now let's show people there's there's like three guys in there a totally tiny
[40:48.920 --> 40:52.360]  audience for a radio slash tv show that reaches millions of people you guys
[40:52.360 --> 40:56.120]  wave at them there you go that's what's in there
[40:56.120 --> 40:59.480]  there's no teleprompters there's no writers there's no nothing it's just me
[40:59.480 --> 41:02.440]  my intellect and history
[41:05.160 --> 41:08.280]  and then cobert can do things that nobody else is allowed to
[41:08.280 --> 41:10.840]  and so can
[41:11.240 --> 41:15.080]  bill marr and all i'm saying is that's wrong you guys shouldn't call for the
[41:15.080 --> 41:19.240]  end of free speech you shouldn't call for censorship all day when you live by
[41:19.240 --> 41:22.440]  it when i'm being censored by google and i'm
[41:22.440 --> 41:25.800]  being blocked on twitter and youtube and they're trying to strangle me while you
[41:25.800 --> 41:29.720]  misrepresent who i am and build a straw man doppelganger
[41:29.720 --> 41:33.000]  to defame me i can't even respond on my own
[41:33.000 --> 41:36.920]  platform as radio stations were on call me and say we're getting calls offering
[41:36.920 --> 41:40.680]  us a half million dollars to take you off by national sponsors
[41:40.680 --> 41:43.960]  and a lot of them say we're going to keep you on even though your show has good
[41:43.960 --> 41:46.600]  ratings but doesn't even bring in close that money we're keeping you on for
[41:46.600 --> 41:49.640]  america if you're listening to us on local stations you better send them
[41:49.640 --> 41:53.080]  ten dollars fifty dollars a hundred dollars you better thank them you better
[41:53.080 --> 41:56.280]  become a local sponsor because there's a total war
[41:56.280 --> 41:59.240]  trying to shut us down this is the real fight for america
[41:59.240 --> 42:02.920]  this is 21st century information war and if they can shut us down
[42:02.920 --> 42:06.840]  they can shut everybody down let's go out to break with cobert
[42:06.840 --> 42:10.840]  making his johnson holster comment that he's under investigation for hate
[42:10.840 --> 42:14.920]  speech by the FCC when did the FCC have hate speech
[42:14.920 --> 42:22.440]  jurisdiction here it is mr trump your presidency i love your presidency
[42:22.440 --> 42:26.440]  i call it disgrace the nation

[42:58.920 --> 43:03.400]  we all know that when the democratic party blamed hillary clinton's loss on
[43:03.400 --> 43:06.840]  the russians it was the biggest dog ate my homework
[43:06.840 --> 43:11.000]  excuse ever but it seems now the vice president of the democratic
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.120]  political firm global strategy group said that according to their analysis
[43:16.120 --> 43:22.120]  two-thirds of the voters obama picked up in 2012 ended up leaving the democratic
[43:22.120 --> 43:25.880]  party to vote for trump so 70 percent of the reason
[43:25.880 --> 43:30.760]  hillary clinton loss can be attributed to her failure to pick up these prior
[43:30.760 --> 43:34.920]  obama voters she claims to be part of the resistance but even
[43:34.920 --> 43:39.640]  anti-faw doesn't want her there have even been rumors circulating that she may
[43:39.640 --> 43:45.000]  try to run again in 2020 rob snider recently tweeted at this

[47:48.360 --> 47:53.080]  mean i know most of his complete lies still i get why people
[47:53.080 --> 47:57.000]  like you so in the last month he's really been attacking me
[47:57.000 --> 48:00.280]  i mean we're talking almost every day so i'm sending private messages
[48:00.280 --> 48:03.800]  to the character he created he admits is based on me tuck buckford
[48:03.800 --> 48:11.160]  and to his official cbs show and then to his official
[48:11.160 --> 48:17.960]  steven at home site and no responses obviously because he's such a god
[48:17.960 --> 48:23.880]  creature to me saying have me on
[48:23.880 --> 48:27.560]  i mean normally when he's attacking trump trumps put on the show or he's
[48:27.560 --> 48:30.120]  attacking bill o'reilly bill o'reilly's been on a bunch
[48:30.120 --> 48:33.080]  i'm this major part of the show he has a character based on me
[48:33.080 --> 48:39.400]  and i'm not on i'm on with edited clips which does the same thing
[48:39.400 --> 48:42.760]  people go god who's alex jones and we get more listeners i mean our listeners
[48:42.760 --> 48:45.240]  have only gone up because those are big shows
[48:45.240 --> 48:49.160]  mainstream news mainstream tv mainstream stuff like that has no viewers
[48:49.160 --> 48:55.000]  but cobert has a big audience super bowl has a giant audience and that's
[48:55.000 --> 48:59.400]  where there's the anti-family ads the anti-gun ads i mean you look at this
[48:59.400 --> 49:03.480]  these people are out to get us hollywood is out to get us
[49:03.480 --> 49:08.120]  it's incredible and they can make whatever jokes they want they can make
[49:08.120 --> 49:11.000]  up whatever they want they can say that you know trumps having sex with his
[49:11.000 --> 49:17.720]  kids it's all okay they can say i'm a racist
[49:17.720 --> 49:21.720]  they can say trumps are racist and none of it's true and the message is
[49:21.720 --> 49:24.680]  everybody else you shut up and do what you're told
[49:24.680 --> 49:28.920]  or we're going to call you racist i remember msnbc over and over again
[49:28.920 --> 49:32.120]  would say alex jones is deeply racist they never show a clip
[49:32.120 --> 49:37.160]  it was because i was criticizing obama here a giant screw job
[49:38.520 --> 49:42.200]  and so now can we pull up that article uh that was friday
[49:42.200 --> 49:45.320]  cliford cuttingham where the new yorker magazine openly says they want to
[49:45.320 --> 49:50.520]  overthrow president trump i did some reports on that
[49:50.520 --> 49:53.880]  on friday with david night but here they are in the new yorker
[49:53.880 --> 49:57.080]  magazine one of the most elite publications out there
[49:57.080 --> 50:00.920]  saying we're secretly meeting to overthrow trump
[50:00.920 --> 50:04.440]  we might just have a coup d'etat well that's also being prepared
[50:04.440 --> 50:10.360]  by the shadow government i mean forget trump forget who he is
[50:10.360 --> 50:14.760]  they're just calmly reporting on it when he's killing after killing cat kill
[50:14.760 --> 50:17.640]  tpp three trillion the stock market hundreds of
[50:17.640 --> 50:21.000]  billions of new jobs 500 000 new jobs already
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.840]  here i mean he really is the globalists have sold us out folks we were the
[50:24.840 --> 50:26.680]  richest country in the world we had half the wealth
[50:26.680 --> 50:30.200]  he's really turned us back on
[50:30.200 --> 50:33.400]  so they have 200 psychologists and psychiatrists violating
[50:33.400 --> 50:41.000]  the the goldwater rule from 1963 1964 68 and went on three times
[50:41.000 --> 50:44.840]  going on tv saying he's mentally ill when they're not allowed to diagnose from a
[50:44.840 --> 50:47.320]  distance plus their science is mainly a bunch of quack
[50:47.320 --> 50:51.000]  crap it's just some made-up stuff in germany 200 years ago to control
[50:51.000 --> 50:54.120]  populations sure is there some labels you put on crazy people are
[50:54.120 --> 50:57.240]  they're crazy people yeah but psychiatrists and psychologists can't
[50:57.240 --> 51:02.440]  agree with each other on the hundreds of new designations they've got
[51:03.160 --> 51:07.080]  but trump's crazy because he works his ass off and is a trailblazer and
[51:07.080 --> 51:10.680]  defeated the mainstream media no he's real and they can't stand him
[51:10.680 --> 51:14.200]  does that mean he's not making mistakes absolutely not saying a son should be
[51:14.200 --> 51:18.200]  arrested when a son's put you in office and you said give us more stuff a son
[51:18.200 --> 51:24.600]  that's dishonorable don't know that clear false flag in Syria
[51:24.600 --> 51:27.720]  when the rebels have been caught repeatedly staging chemical attacks on
[51:27.720 --> 51:32.280]  themselves to launch a pretext for war i get why you did to look
[51:32.280 --> 51:34.760]  strong for china and the rest of it but they're never going to stop saying
[51:34.760 --> 51:37.400]  you're a russian agent trump tweeted today
[51:37.400 --> 51:40.200]  hillary's in bed with the russians and the chinese why are they still saying i'm
[51:40.200 --> 51:43.320]  a russian agent because you're an american out for america
[51:43.320 --> 51:48.120]  and they're globalist so they're going to say that you are what they are sir
[51:48.120 --> 51:50.840]  trump's biggest mistake was getting an office
[51:50.840 --> 51:54.040]  trying to be presidential trying to bury the hatchet they're not going to bury
[51:54.040 --> 51:56.840]  the hatchet with you you could roll over to them they'll never stop trying to
[51:56.840 --> 51:59.160]  destroy you look at Ivanka kissing their ass
[51:59.160 --> 52:02.440]  going over to germany saying open the borders up to muslims
[52:02.440 --> 52:06.360]  saying her daddy's wrong that gets them attacking her more in msm they see
[52:06.360 --> 52:09.960]  weakness that's got them saying you have sex with your daughter
[52:09.960 --> 52:12.920]  let's get bill mar ready one more time for radio listeners you just kind of
[52:12.920 --> 52:17.240]  here making jokes but he physically you know implies the act of her having
[52:17.240 --> 52:20.440]  sex with her father no daddy
[52:20.440 --> 52:23.480]  and on top of her father you're like oh this is a family show
[52:23.480 --> 52:27.240]  that's what they're doing on their so-called new show that's politically
[52:27.240 --> 52:32.040]  incorrects his old name for it real time real horsemen are with a little
[52:32.040 --> 52:34.600]  coward reading off a teleprompter with a hundred

[55:26.920 --> 55:30.520]  southern part of the country from 40 to 42 while the vc regime was the
[55:30.520 --> 55:33.000]  normal government of france is a whole germany military

[1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:32.200]  ancient feudalism but people hear that thing oh that's scary
[1:00:32.200 --> 1:00:36.120]  yeah freedom is scary and i'm gonna go to your phone calls right now i pulled
[1:00:36.120 --> 1:00:38.920]  up more footage of hitler returns to germany
[1:00:38.920 --> 1:00:42.440]  from france and just the french out parading highly hitler
[1:00:42.440 --> 1:00:45.560]  i found some of the footage i knew i'd seen before of them
[1:00:45.560 --> 1:00:48.840]  hailing him and i guess they're doing it again from macron
[1:00:48.840 --> 1:00:52.760]  i mean did they steal the election by 30 points
[1:00:52.760 --> 1:00:55.880]  against lapin or do they really just submit this bad
[1:00:55.880 --> 1:00:59.800]  wanting to be domesticated scared of freedom i hate to run down the french
[1:00:59.800 --> 1:01:03.320]  they helped us found our country they should be very smart very warlike very
[1:01:03.320 --> 1:01:07.880]  inventive very strong people but i guess napoleon killed
[1:01:07.880 --> 1:01:11.640]  half their military age men and they just all the fighters are dead
[1:01:11.640 --> 1:01:15.400]  french used to be taller than brits but napoleon likes to put the tall guys in the
[1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:18.520]  front line to intimidate people so i don't blame the french they just
[1:01:18.520 --> 1:01:21.560]  learned to roll over they don't want to have the
[1:01:21.560 --> 1:01:24.360]  briggs it they want to be ruled by the uu they want to be slaves
[1:01:24.360 --> 1:01:27.960]  they want the socialist parties to be tax exempt and rule over them
[1:01:27.960 --> 1:01:31.960]  bondage is their god we'll talk to john and canada abel
[1:01:31.960 --> 1:01:36.920]  shon robert jacob tony jared dakota john who's up first here
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:42.040]  let me look at these calls up first let's talk to john and canada about the
[1:01:42.040 --> 1:01:45.480]  election in france go ahead greetings from the former
[1:01:45.480 --> 1:01:49.400]  people's republic of canada with a k how are you today sir alex
[1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:53.400]  you know i'm i'm just bummed out uh do you think it was rigged through media
[1:01:53.400 --> 1:01:56.840]  control manipulation or rigged at the ballot box
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:00.920]  i really don't know i haven't been following that yet that close but um
[1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:05.160]  it wouldn't surprise me at all if it was rigged uh they're they're
[1:02:05.160 --> 1:02:09.160]  it it just seems like everything is just going so fast so crazy
[1:02:09.160 --> 1:02:12.440]  um i really don't know what to say like
[1:02:12.440 --> 1:02:16.120]  they're they're bringing out like nationalism is the big enemy
[1:02:16.120 --> 1:02:20.040]  and uh they don't want to hook up socialism with that national socialist
[1:02:20.040 --> 1:02:23.560]  ideal right no they don't but that's what's crazy
[1:02:23.560 --> 1:02:27.480]  is that france is now under german control not the german people but the
[1:02:27.480 --> 1:02:31.480]  germans are running the eu uh and it's it's just crazy to see france
[1:02:31.480 --> 1:02:36.760]  again conquered by germany yeah um another thing is i'm i'm
[1:02:36.760 --> 1:02:40.360]  seeing it all to the media how everything nationalistic like
[1:02:40.360 --> 1:02:43.720]  personally national being nationalistic is i like my country i think my
[1:02:43.720 --> 1:02:46.920]  leaders should stick up for their country before other countries
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:50.440]  if you're not nationalistic you're global then your interests are sold out you
[1:02:50.440 --> 1:02:53.560]  need the nation to stick up for the people's interest
[1:02:53.560 --> 1:02:57.560]  or you get one-sided deals but but under globalism it says don't look out for
[1:02:57.560 --> 1:03:01.000]  yourself be a chump be an idiot exactly man
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:04.760]  um like even even the movie about einstein or the
[1:03:04.760 --> 1:03:07.880]  the series about einstein genius or they're bringing nationalism into that
[1:03:07.880 --> 1:03:13.480]  like big time and yeah i was there but it wasn't socialist not bringing out the
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:17.240]  whole socialistic issue of it you know um
[1:03:17.240 --> 1:03:20.600]  they're they're vilifying anything like even in canada we get the series called
[1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:24.040]  the handmaid handmaid tale which is just disgusting
[1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:28.120]  it's it's propaganda you know you don't see christians hanging people with
[1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:31.560]  trains i was about to say the handmaid's tales coming back out it was a 1980s
[1:03:31.560 --> 1:03:34.760]  film with robert devol where christians basically act like islam
[1:03:34.760 --> 1:03:38.520]  and enslave women and then meanwhile it's christianity that empowered women
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:42.120]  and ended slavery so they reversed it with new hollywood movies coming out
[1:03:42.120 --> 1:03:45.320]  with interviews about how horrible christians are putting hoods on women's
[1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:47.800]  heads when that's what islam does don't you love it
[1:03:47.800 --> 1:03:51.320]  meanwhile the feminists are putting on hijabs now usa today
[1:03:51.320 --> 1:03:57.480]  in solidarity with islam yeah exactly it's
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:02.920]  i just see stuff just going so crazy um you know i see people in online forms
[1:04:02.920 --> 1:04:06.120]  like people showing up that haven't been there before and their garden they
[1:04:06.120 --> 1:04:10.600]  break form rules uh i don't know how to um you know

[1:10:27.240 --> 1:10:31.560]  and i said well i noticed melatonin won't knock me out alone but i said if i
[1:10:31.560 --> 1:10:37.080]  take l tryptophan or if i take that's a meal meat or if i take
[1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:40.440]  valerian root with it when i'm not being able to sleep sometimes it totally
[1:10:40.440 --> 1:10:43.320]  knocks me out i said can we add l tryptophan
[1:10:43.320 --> 1:10:47.320]  valerian root and the same dose of melatonin with lemon balm
[1:10:47.320 --> 1:10:51.160]  chamomile and and a key acid that is shallow rates together and the

[1:12:34.360 --> 1:12:39.080]  prime membership subscriber i think that could be improved
[1:12:39.080 --> 1:12:42.840]  i think that could be greatly improved but the um tna enforcement knockout i just
[1:12:42.840 --> 1:12:46.200]  got that from your um no you're right we launched the paid app and i just
[1:12:46.200 --> 1:12:49.000]  haven't done a lot of live feeds and stuff we're gonna we're gonna head to
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:53.240]  that i apologize okay let me get to my point about cobear and
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:56.680]  kimball i know some of those guys from magic that was involved in comedy and
[1:12:56.680 --> 1:13:00.680]  that was my uh my hobby in college and we're about set of college
[1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:07.720]  and um my uh my deal was and and you could submit jokes to these shows
[1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:10.520]  and i would do that my friends would do that i know people that were writers on
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:13.800]  the show and i still know people that are writers now
[1:13:13.800 --> 1:13:18.600]  and um you can submit jokes and if you get a joke to get it got in you get like
[1:13:18.600 --> 1:13:23.800]  eighty eight dollars or something so i would do that but uh back in any in the
[1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:26.120]  eighties this is to get my point about um
[1:13:26.120 --> 1:13:29.480]  cobear and why he's uncouthed on you so much back in the eighties johnny
[1:13:29.480 --> 1:13:33.080]  karsten had 20 million people watching then um you had a little
[1:13:33.080 --> 1:13:36.200]  letterman back in the nineties and two thousand
[1:13:36.200 --> 1:13:40.280]  and it was like um eight and ten million people watching those shows
[1:13:40.280 --> 1:13:43.640]  now you have two two and a half million people watching
[1:13:43.640 --> 1:13:47.080]  watching on cobear at night that's nothing it's like ten percent of what
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:49.880]  karsten did they're making i saw they're making fifty thousand
[1:13:49.880 --> 1:13:53.640]  dollars a spot which is nothing the show is not profitable
[1:13:53.640 --> 1:13:57.960]  and then on those late night shows what they don't what you don't realize is uh
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:01.480]  every minute they have ratings because every minute somebody's turned the show
[1:14:01.480 --> 1:14:05.160]  off to go to bed so and able to make it to that first
[1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:08.200]  commercial spot and that second commercial spot what they have to do is
[1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:12.600]  get people to keep the televisions um on and not turn it off
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:15.960]  and what better way to do that than to goof on you
[1:14:15.960 --> 1:14:19.800]  and maybe get a half million million people that listen to you out of the
[1:14:19.800 --> 1:14:23.640]  forty fifteen million people to watch every night it's um
[1:14:23.640 --> 1:14:26.840]  it's increasing their ad revenue and it's getting people to watch
[1:14:26.840 --> 1:14:30.280]  that's what you're absolutely right the whole corporate media is a shadow of its
[1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:34.040]  former self but when they play the cobear clips on every other news channel
[1:14:34.040 --> 1:14:37.400]  then it becomes big but they're only big when they're political
[1:14:37.400 --> 1:14:40.360]  and then that doesn't even help their advertisers it helps the other shows
[1:14:40.360 --> 1:14:44.680]  that are playing it so that's my point is that i don't need cobear
[1:14:44.680 --> 1:14:49.080]  he needs me we really do have three or four million people a day tuning into
[1:14:49.080 --> 1:14:52.040]  the syndicated show weekdays a couple million to the sunday show
[1:14:52.040 --> 1:14:56.920]  then all the derivatives it's huge so there's this paradigm
[1:14:56.920 --> 1:15:02.360]  where his show isn't big but when it goes on all the other shows it is big
[1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:05.560]  but they only put him on the other shows when he says something horrible
[1:15:05.560 --> 1:15:10.840]  about myself or others to hurt me so then how do i respond to that
[1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:15.560]  to be honest i just do fun him i mean
[1:15:15.560 --> 1:15:19.640]  alex you could do his comedy you could do the same jokes funnier than he can
[1:15:19.640 --> 1:15:22.520]  i don't think he's doing funny i've never thought he was very funny i saw him in
[1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:27.160]  the night he was desperate pathetic sure i mean i'm trying to sound nice
[1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:29.720]  when i say he comes off as a nice guy i think is i don't hate him
[1:15:29.720 --> 1:15:32.680]  individually i just it's weird to be attacked constantly
[1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:35.880]  and then they even say that that they're you and then you don't get her
[1:15:35.880 --> 1:15:38.840]  it's like they're saying i'm a russian spy in congress having defense
[1:15:38.840 --> 1:15:42.040]  department hearings in the house armed services committee
[1:15:42.040 --> 1:15:45.160]  and then no one calls me to the committee it's like you know
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:48.760]  it's like i'm a russian agent but no proof and i can't go to the committee
[1:15:48.760 --> 1:15:52.680]  it's just like crazy thank you so much and yes i need to update the new app we're
[1:15:52.680 --> 1:15:58.200]  going to do more on that you're absolutely right
[1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:02.520]  today we call it bone broth and for thousands of years our ancestors
[1:16:02.520 --> 1:16:05.800]  enjoyed its benefits before it became lost to our modern diets

[1:16:30.520 --> 1:16:33.800]  parts of the animal you used the meat for sustenance the fat for cooking but

[1:20:47.640 --> 1:20:50.280]  i haven't talked a lot about cobear and all the rest of it's just that they're
[1:20:50.280 --> 1:20:54.440]  constantly attacking me they're constantly lying about me
[1:20:54.440 --> 1:20:58.040]  but they're constantly lying about you and they get away with stuff that nobody

[1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:56.040]  support the truth and build something greater out of that by building an
[1:23:56.040 --> 1:23:58.200]  economy building an arc building a remnant
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:24:01.480]  building a future so don't thank me for letting you plug

[1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:34.840]  part of what we want to do is take a third at least a third of the money made
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:38.280]  from this game maybe more we're seeking god on that and everyone else in the
[1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:41.080]  truth community we've been wanting to get a hold of you desperately

[1:24:44.440 --> 1:24:47.240]  one of our programmers said let's poke the dragon in the eye
[1:24:47.240 --> 1:24:51.080]  with what they're doing to you alex at info wars with the the trying to cut
[1:24:51.080 --> 1:24:53.960]  the advertising they're going after drudge it's obvious that we're in a
[1:24:53.960 --> 1:24:57.160]  fight for our lives there's no there's no doubt we're in a fight for our lives
[1:24:57.160 --> 1:25:00.120]  that's right the attack we're under in the last year
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:03.960]  is as much as i had in 22 years previous all in just a few months
[1:25:03.960 --> 1:25:07.880]  and it's it's exponential but the great thing is as bad as it gets and it's
[1:25:07.880 --> 1:25:11.240]  hard every time doors close other doors open and
[1:25:11.240 --> 1:25:13.960]  i've just i've got faith in god so don't worry about me
[1:25:13.960 --> 1:25:18.360]  man well thank you alex i but what our hope was anyway just a thought that we
[1:25:18.360 --> 1:25:21.720]  we've been wanting to fight is to stop well that's exciting tell folks about
[1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:26.200]  jesus's lord games in this new game it's called the secret of akkadian island
[1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:29.480]  and we're we're right now trying to pull together funds we got the game about
[1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:33.160]  20 done and like i say a lot of these guys have worked on call of duty

[1:25:36.760 --> 1:25:40.440]  animator worked with him for years uh because that's like a billion dollar
[1:25:40.440 --> 1:25:44.520]  franchise right now five nights at freddy but anyway our animation our games
[1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:47.720]  are going to be powerful they're going through the storyline god had given me
[1:25:47.720 --> 1:25:51.240]  a long time ago a script i tried to get the mel Gibson about 2000
[1:25:51.240 --> 1:25:54.760]  we're using that as the base for the game and in there we're wanting
[1:25:54.760 --> 1:25:58.600]  desperately to connect with individuals such as yourself and others and we will
[1:25:58.600 --> 1:26:02.200]  literally take directly from the headlines as your character is going
[1:26:02.200 --> 1:26:05.640]  through the game you're going to be dropped into an island there's a secret
[1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:08.840]  underground that you're a part of and this is based on reality right now
[1:26:08.840 --> 1:26:11.880]  because you've had steve cullin other people on and i've i've talked personally
[1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:15.240]  with some of the people you've had a whole breakaway civilization

[1:26:25.080 --> 1:26:29.560]  interviewed them says others have right and there that's what this is based on
[1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:32.840]  that let me put you on hold one of my the main

[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:24.440]  they are pushing our buttons to where we are self-censoring
[1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:28.360]  when gobert said president trump is a johnson holster
[1:27:28.360 --> 1:27:31.960]  he's calling all of us who voted for president trump won
[1:27:31.960 --> 1:27:36.440]  in the movie saying we're all minions of putin they said french that don't want
[1:27:36.440 --> 1:27:40.680]  to be under EU controller russian agents just when do the russians become god
[1:27:40.680 --> 1:27:44.440]  and run everything i don't want to be under george soros forget the russians
[1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:47.720]  if the russians were in my business i'd be in their face
[1:27:47.720 --> 1:27:52.200]  my god if the russians themselves were as popular as they say they are
[1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:57.480]  they're already taken over the world exactly now getting back to my my
[1:27:57.480 --> 1:28:00.280]  statement here in the movie american president
[1:28:00.280 --> 1:28:03.960]  drippes his character attacks the president's girlfriend i don't know if
[1:28:03.960 --> 1:28:09.400]  you're familiar with the the movie or not yes he comes up to the podium at the
[1:28:09.400 --> 1:28:12.680]  end of the movie he starts rattling off this whole thing
[1:28:12.680 --> 1:28:16.360]  president trump needs to step up to the news podium
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:23.160]  and dot their eyes on live tv we need to rise to the challenge cbs right isn't
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:26.120]  that robert robert stay there i'm gonna come back to you after the break i want
[1:28:26.120 --> 1:28:30.760]  to you like stay there don't hang up okay promise promise

[1:28:34.040 --> 1:28:37.960]  buckley my great cousin he's been off on him for 22 years
[1:28:37.960 --> 1:28:40.760]  he grabbed him by the shoulders before i went on air about 30 minutes before i
[1:28:40.760 --> 1:28:45.080]  went on air about two hours ago he said trump's problem is he isn't candidate
[1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:47.960]  trump he's trying to be presidential he's got to go on the offense
[1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:51.400]  there's enemy get in there and tell him and i said you're absolutely right and
[1:28:51.400 --> 1:28:54.280]  so let's talk about that that's what buckley's saying is what robert's
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:59.080]  saying is what you're saying
[1:28:59.080 --> 1:29:03.720]  we all know that when the democratic party blamed hillary clinton's loss on the
[1:29:03.720 --> 1:29:08.120]  russians it was the biggest dog ate my homework excuse ever
[1:29:08.120 --> 1:29:12.600]  but it seems now the vice president of the democratic political firm global
[1:29:12.600 --> 1:29:16.600]  strategy group said that according to their analysis two
[1:29:16.600 --> 1:29:22.200]  thirds of the voters obama picked up in 2012 ended up leaving the democratic
[1:29:22.200 --> 1:29:25.960]  party to vote for trump so 70 of the reason
[1:29:25.960 --> 1:29:30.840]  hillary clinton loss can be attributed to her failure to pick up these prior
[1:29:30.840 --> 1:29:35.000]  obama voters she claims to be part of the resistance but even
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:39.720]  anti-fah doesn't want her there have even been rumors circulating that she may
[1:29:39.720 --> 1:29:45.720]  try to run again in 2020 rob snider recently tweeted at this point i
[1:29:45.720 --> 1:29:50.760]  believe a judge should grant america a restraining order against hillary
[1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:53.960]  clinton for stocking i'm millie weaver for more

[1:33:29.480 --> 1:33:35.960]  bad luck when been blowing at my back
[1:33:37.560 --> 1:33:45.960]  i was born to bring trouble to wherever i'm at
[1:33:45.960 --> 1:33:52.760]  got the number 13 tattooed on my neck
[1:33:52.760 --> 1:34:02.360]  when the ink starts to itch then the black will turn to red
[1:34:02.360 --> 1:34:07.560]  i was born in the soul we're getting on the line right now here in a moment
[1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:10.760]  but i intended already had one about this topic so i'm glad this caller called in
[1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:16.040]  robert california about what trump needs to do
[1:34:16.040 --> 1:34:21.960]  talking to my crew earlier today trump the candidate was hardcore brazen
[1:34:21.960 --> 1:34:25.880]  politically incorrect but he's taking that
[1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:33.800]  fire-breathing patriot and muzzled it about 90 percent
[1:34:33.800 --> 1:34:38.360]  they'll raise the sunshine coming in
[1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:45.000]  but i see the media attacking him and his family trying to bully
[1:34:45.000 --> 1:34:49.240]  his aides in the submission trump won't give in but
[1:34:49.240 --> 1:34:52.440]  he's like a rock out the middle of the ocean big waves hitting and he's standing
[1:34:52.440 --> 1:34:56.360]  strong for thousands of years and thousands more to come
[1:34:56.360 --> 1:34:59.400]  if you looked at it as a metaphor but the people around him are like sand
[1:34:59.400 --> 1:35:03.240]  they're collapsing they're flowing away the jared cussioners
[1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:07.160]  on the communist chinese payroll his daughter avanka thinking she's the
[1:35:07.160 --> 1:35:10.120]  president she goes and kisses the ass of merkel calls for his
[1:35:10.120 --> 1:35:14.120]  llamas to come in and millmark jokes few days later that she's having sex with
[1:35:14.120 --> 1:35:19.560]  her dad think of the democrats
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:23.640]  saw republicans saying things like that if i got up here and said obama was
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:26.600]  having sex with his daughters i'm not saying that
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:29.640]  the media is so corrupt they'll probably edit that out and say i did
[1:35:29.640 --> 1:35:34.360]  just imagine that these weasels like bill marr reading off teleprompters with a
[1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:37.640]  huge writing staff and steven colbert it's a joke
[1:35:37.640 --> 1:35:40.520]  roger stone will give us his take on what trump should do and other breaking
[1:35:40.520 --> 1:35:43.240]  news here in a few minutes but finishing up with robert california you were
[1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:46.760]  getting started before went to break what does donald trump need to do he's
[1:35:46.760 --> 1:35:50.120]  to take the gloves off and become the man we all loved again
[1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:54.920]  he's gotten so much done that's good tpp killed killing napkin gat being
[1:35:54.920 --> 1:35:59.240]  stronger china taking out isis and al qaeda
[1:35:59.240 --> 1:36:03.240]  three trillion the stock market 300 billion in new jobs
[1:36:03.240 --> 1:36:07.000]  half a million new jobs i mean he's an american president that's why they
[1:36:07.000 --> 1:36:10.920]  hate him he's not perfect but he's an american he's making the decisions
[1:36:10.920 --> 1:36:14.440]  he's doing it and all these enemies that thought we were broke back
[1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:18.120]  and who tried to stop him they've been proving to be frauds the media all of
[1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:21.320]  them are fake polls that's why i'm backing trump
[1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:25.080]  because i know he's for real and they hate it think about how bad hillary be
[1:36:25.080 --> 1:36:29.400]  right now but that said we're loyal opposition we're going to keep him true
[1:36:29.400 --> 1:36:32.680]  and now it's up on info wars dot com roger eloquently broke this town on
[1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:36.440]  friday when he was co hosting with me report congress holding secret
[1:36:36.440 --> 1:36:40.360]  conversations about removing trump by force of need be or claiming he's
[1:36:40.360 --> 1:36:42.920]  mentally ill that's the new yorker magazine how
[1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:45.720]  trump could get fired we're going to talk about that in a few minutes of roger
[1:36:45.720 --> 1:36:48.600]  stone and finish up with your calls after he's been on with us but
[1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:52.840]  go ahead and make your point robert because all of us eat on c span talk
[1:36:52.840 --> 1:36:56.680]  radio you name it not just when i rarely talk to him or roger talks to him
[1:36:56.680 --> 1:37:02.760]  communicate to him a man surrounded by iemis a lion under attack by the wolves
[1:37:02.760 --> 1:37:06.680]  it's more we should drain the strump locally what should trump do
[1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:11.800]  what should we do go ahead robert like i was saying alex
[1:37:11.800 --> 1:37:15.240]  we need to rise to the challenge i tried to call in the other day
[1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:21.400]  and i missed it by just that much listen you're saying and and i feel you i
[1:37:21.400 --> 1:37:25.000]  really do you're saying that if we're not getting involved
[1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:29.880]  maybe we do want them to rule over us who is to say trump isn't thinking the
[1:37:29.880 --> 1:37:33.160]  same thing you know we need to knock out their
[1:37:33.160 --> 1:37:39.320]  comms take out or take a take over their their media i mean we just we need to
[1:37:39.320 --> 1:37:43.720]  just shout them down and and do whatever it is to get them
[1:37:43.720 --> 1:37:47.400]  and petitions you know i knew how to beat the questions because he says a
[1:37:47.400 --> 1:37:51.320]  history of rape and settling it i knew if our listeners took action and went to
[1:37:51.320 --> 1:37:53.640]  every live event and screamed bill clinton's a rapist
[1:37:53.640 --> 1:37:56.360]  he would psychologically break their will or whole claim that trump was a
[1:37:56.360 --> 1:38:00.120]  predator when there was no evidence and i haven't thought of the slogans yet
[1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:02.520]  quite frankly they really want to kill me so i almost don't even want to make it
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:05.320]  about me but who else is more prominent
[1:38:05.320 --> 1:38:09.000]  uh i think people should get on live tv peacefully not just calling the c-span
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:12.520]  get in front of cameras get on at live events go to democratic events go to
[1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:16.120]  these town halls where they're paying people to bust them in to shout down
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:20.040]  the freedom caucus and trump i think all of you you're the answer just get out
[1:38:20.040 --> 1:38:23.000]  there and say info wars dot com is forbidden
[1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:26.520]  you'll never stop america we know america's run by foreign banks

[1:38:41.880 --> 1:38:45.640]  humanity so as bad as stuff gets my own personal life and things
[1:38:45.640 --> 1:38:49.880]  you know what i'm manning up and i'm not saying that as an arrogant way i'm
[1:38:49.880 --> 1:38:53.080]  actually ashamed in a way that i'm not more wimpy
[1:38:53.080 --> 1:38:57.320]  and i don't take stuff more painfully it's actually the worst it gets the
[1:38:57.320 --> 1:39:01.400]  better because i see how no matter what happens to this body or my name i'm
[1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:04.120]  winning the world's changing i've changed the world

[1:39:37.560 --> 1:39:40.760]  kill five of them in the process and i've already taken out a bunch of them
[1:39:40.760 --> 1:39:44.040]  and i'm not psyching myself up because i don't need to the truth is this is all
[1:39:44.040 --> 1:39:47.480]  on the surface i'm born for this war i'm not some psycho
[1:39:47.480 --> 1:39:50.920]  parasite my feelings are so big and so deep and so strong
[1:39:50.920 --> 1:39:54.280]  i'm ready to lay it all down for everybody my family everything's on the
[1:39:54.280 --> 1:39:58.040]  line my name my treasure my blood i wrote john handcock on that
[1:39:58.040 --> 1:40:01.480]  declaration of dependence and i mean it and being pure
[1:40:01.480 --> 1:40:04.760]  is the greatest form of being alive we're going to break in a few minutes of
[1:40:04.760 --> 1:40:08.520]  roger stoneholding busy guy stokeholdtruth.com being demonized being
[1:40:08.520 --> 1:40:11.880]  attacked you name it former head of the trump campaign roger what does donald
[1:40:11.880 --> 1:40:15.560]  trump need to do right now well he is indeed
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:20.920]  besieged by hyenas he's a giant surrounded by midgets
[1:40:20.920 --> 1:40:24.840]  and many many of the people who work for him alex
[1:40:24.840 --> 1:40:28.120]  still don't understand him don't understand his genius
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:31.560]  don't understand his the idiosyncrasies of his
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:35.400]  leadership style and of course there are those who
[1:40:35.400 --> 1:40:39.640]  denigrate the way he goes about business is in the way they denigrated
[1:40:39.640 --> 1:40:43.080]  andrew jackson theodore roosevelt many of our other
[1:40:43.080 --> 1:40:47.640]  tougher and more combative spectators the lesser men that sit
[1:40:47.640 --> 1:40:51.240]  back and watch great men strive fail or succeed
[1:40:51.240 --> 1:40:54.680]  that's exactly right they sit at the edges of the arena pointing out where
[1:40:54.680 --> 1:40:58.600]  the strongman uh well fell or where he could have done things better
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:02.920]  but they're lily livery they don't have the cojones to jump in the
[1:41:02.920 --> 1:41:06.920]  arena themselves uh i would say several things that
[1:41:06.920 --> 1:41:10.840]  are disturbing me alex and that is i have uncovered
[1:41:10.840 --> 1:41:17.480]  uh trump penn's transition documents that indicate to me that virtually every
[1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:23.240]  person hired for second and third level positions at the
[1:41:23.240 --> 1:41:27.080]  tillerson state department was recommended by
[1:41:27.080 --> 1:41:33.720]  condoleezza rice that condoleezza rice was the chief progenitor of the
[1:41:33.720 --> 1:41:37.720]  appointment of rex tillerson something steve bannon knew in
[1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:42.440]  real time but said nothing about so this is three
[1:41:42.440 --> 1:41:46.200]  uh and that and that bannon uh pardon me and that tillerson
[1:41:46.200 --> 1:41:50.120]  uh seems to be under the sway of his deputy
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:55.480]  also placed by condoleezza a never crumpled on my ad now
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:58.840]  condoleezza rice is very very close to
[1:41:58.840 --> 1:42:04.280]  donna brazil they're like best friends and you will recall that donna brazil
[1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:08.600]  was caught red-handed uh at cnn handing the questions that
[1:42:08.600 --> 1:42:12.840]  regularized in the debates to hillary clinton in advance
[1:42:12.840 --> 1:42:19.160]  was also on brazil's watch that the democratic national committee uh
[1:42:19.160 --> 1:42:22.360]  strove to steal the nomination from
[1:42:22.360 --> 1:42:27.320]  poorl bernie sanders so there's a network here and of course condoleezza
[1:42:27.320 --> 1:42:30.840]  rice is the hel con most closely responds well i'll stay
[1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:34.520]  i'm gonna give you the floor when we come back in three minutes uh roger stone

[1:47:38.840 --> 1:47:43.080]  former head of the trump campaign i got a big netflix show they're saying probably
[1:47:43.080 --> 1:47:47.800]  the highest rated ever from netflix uh the real house of cards as he exposes it
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:51.160]  coming out here in just a few days i'm in it as well look forward to
[1:47:51.160 --> 1:47:53.960]  actually sitting down and watching something like that that's actually
[1:47:53.960 --> 1:47:57.160]  based somewhat in reality we'll see how they spin it but roger thinks it may be
[1:47:57.160 --> 1:48:01.400]  somewhat fair let's see but that's a separate issue roger
[1:48:01.400 --> 1:48:06.840]  all i know is trump's for real even when he compromises they only come after
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:10.520]  anymore he's got a better bill now in the house past
[1:48:10.520 --> 1:48:13.800]  he's delivering like no president i ever read about in history books
[1:48:13.800 --> 1:48:17.400]  in the first 106 seven days they're branding him as a failure they're
[1:48:17.400 --> 1:48:20.840]  saying they want to remove him in the new yorker magazine or having secret
[1:48:20.840 --> 1:48:25.000]  meetings about a coup d'etat or a 25th amendment move and then members of his
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:28.360]  cabinet are talking to the newspapers saying oh yeah we're getting ready to
[1:48:28.360 --> 1:48:31.960]  remove him as you always said if he brings in people
[1:48:31.960 --> 1:48:35.320]  that he thinks can quote guide him through the goblins nest
[1:48:35.320 --> 1:48:38.680]  the big thread is like reagan they'll try to remove him so in the 10 minutes we
[1:48:38.680 --> 1:48:42.920]  have left you have the floor lay out this amazing development this exclusive
[1:48:42.920 --> 1:48:47.160]  the documents you've gotten that the entire state department for a month they
[1:48:47.160 --> 1:48:50.040]  wouldn't put anybody in there was a total blockage now they're putting their
[1:48:50.040 --> 1:48:53.000]  people in from connalisa rice and donna brazil what a
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  nightmare scenario yeah alex this is very very much
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:00.840]  like the situation that i encountered around president reagan
[1:49:00.840 --> 1:49:04.440]  president reagan like donald trump knew what he believed in could not be pushed
[1:49:04.440 --> 1:49:07.480]  beyond it but despite the very personal efforts of the
[1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:11.720]  establishment of kids around him i mean i watch ronald reagan ben james
[1:49:11.720 --> 1:49:15.240]  a baker the third to his will not the other way around
[1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:19.640]  and trump is sometimes brilliant in that sense i'll give you a specific example
[1:49:19.640 --> 1:49:23.320]  dr henry kissinger began courting uh president elect trump
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:28.120]  currently after he was reelected kissinger had actually sent trump several
[1:49:28.120 --> 1:49:31.880]  private messages of encouragement during the campaign kissinger
[1:49:31.880 --> 1:49:37.080]  considers himself a republican and has a low regard for the clinton's
[1:49:37.080 --> 1:49:40.840]  shortly thereafter this courtship kind of picked up steam
[1:49:40.840 --> 1:49:45.400]  uh and surprisingly i am told that kissinger was among those who opposed
[1:49:45.400 --> 1:49:49.560]  troops to syria one of the handful of experts
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:55.640]  that took that position and uh i am told that on a recent trip to china from
[1:49:55.640 --> 1:50:00.600]  which kissinger has just returned that he was carrying a message for the
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:03.960]  chinese presumably a an effective message
[1:50:03.960 --> 1:50:09.320]  because evidently it played some role in the new cooperation of the north koreans
[1:50:09.320 --> 1:50:13.320]  with president trump's initiative to have the
[1:50:13.320 --> 1:50:16.920]  chinese help us on the north korean nuclear problem
[1:50:16.920 --> 1:50:19.960]  so you have a classic case here of the president
[1:50:19.960 --> 1:50:24.040]  taking an establishment figure but putting him to work for trump's agenda
[1:50:24.040 --> 1:50:28.920]  and at the same time uh i really fear that the decision last week to block
[1:50:28.920 --> 1:50:34.200]  rick grannell as nato ambassador made at the state department was orchestrated
[1:50:34.200 --> 1:50:39.240]  by uh christ and her uh in her quizzlings around so we all
[1:50:39.240 --> 1:50:43.000]  just have deep state don't leave we have trump through his advisors
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:46.440]  because obviously he can't micromanage all this putting more deep state in on
[1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:48.040]  top of it
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:51.400]  well if you saw the president's remarks uh after the
[1:50:51.400 --> 1:50:55.720]  uh historic uh a repeal of obama care he said this has
[1:50:55.720 --> 1:50:59.160]  united the republican party like nothing before well
[1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:02.760]  yes but it also means you can see his advisors keep telling him that that's
[1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:06.200]  a priority i don't think that is about priority the
[1:51:06.200 --> 1:51:10.920]  the establishment republicans the the uh organization republicans they'll get
[1:51:10.920 --> 1:51:14.840]  on board if the president's policies are popular
[1:51:14.840 --> 1:51:17.720]  they are and if they have if they're free market
[1:51:17.720 --> 1:51:21.160]  abased uh not right trump has to be the leader he can't sit there and try to
[1:51:21.160 --> 1:51:24.520]  court the republicans well we tried this before the
[1:51:24.520 --> 1:51:28.120]  first obama care bill which is spilled milk the liberals still like to talk
[1:51:28.120 --> 1:51:31.160]  about it trump never loses when he tries and fails
[1:51:31.160 --> 1:51:34.440]  you never lose by fighting you only lose when you don't fight
[1:51:34.440 --> 1:51:38.200]  you only lose when you step down that's right he's not a loser getting more
[1:51:38.200 --> 1:51:41.880]  done than any president in history just because some of what he did failed he's
[1:51:41.880 --> 1:51:45.320]  hard-charging it's why they hate him you know a man buys enemies but
[1:51:45.320 --> 1:51:49.400]  incredible intel you're giving folks right now huge exclusive share roger
[1:51:49.400 --> 1:51:53.800]  keep going uh on tomorrow at tomorrow at two eastern
[1:51:53.800 --> 1:51:57.560]  we're going to name names in terms of who inside the state department is doing
[1:51:57.560 --> 1:52:01.160]  condi's bidding uh so you're coming on the show tomorrow at one
[1:52:01.160 --> 1:52:05.640]  central two eastern that is correct and i will have uh you know
[1:52:05.640 --> 1:52:11.400]  we're gonna name names as they say uh it is uh it's outrageous
[1:52:11.400 --> 1:52:16.040]  but it's not unexpected to see that the entrenched political establishment
[1:52:16.040 --> 1:52:19.080]  once they realized they could not defeat Donald Trump
[1:52:19.080 --> 1:52:22.920]  then they figured out that they couldn't destabilize him and discredit him now
[1:52:22.920 --> 1:52:27.160]  they're seeking to co-opt him uh and he as i've said
[1:52:27.160 --> 1:52:32.840]  he's not uh a uh a uh career politician he hasn't hung around
[1:52:32.840 --> 1:52:36.200]  washington waiting for the main chance his whole career he didn't run for
[1:52:36.200 --> 1:52:40.360]  president because he needed to be someone uh and he is not
[1:52:40.360 --> 1:52:45.000]  yet as knowledgeable about the federal system and how the government works and
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:49.480]  how washington works just generally although he is a master of the news
[1:52:49.480 --> 1:52:53.800]  cycle and he always manages to grab the initiative back from his critics which i
[1:52:53.800 --> 1:52:57.240]  think is his great genius the fact that they are
[1:52:57.240 --> 1:53:00.840]  grumbling about removing him is not at all surprising
[1:53:00.840 --> 1:53:05.000]  they don't understand his the idiosyncratic
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:08.440]  i was about to say he is winning he's doing a great job i'm proud to support
[1:53:08.440 --> 1:53:11.560]  him if we expect perfectness for him to get everything done we're crazy he's
[1:53:11.560 --> 1:53:15.160]  got to compromise they hate him because he is so successful he's taking power
[1:53:15.160 --> 1:53:19.240]  back from unelected multinationals back to the people that process is happening
[1:53:19.240 --> 1:53:22.600]  it's why they're panicking but i sit there and i look at the whole
[1:53:22.600 --> 1:53:25.960]  sale demonization the news saying we're allowed to remove him
[1:53:25.960 --> 1:53:30.360]  trying to mainline akute ta that really concerns me and again that certifies
[1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:34.040]  how good he is i think trump's biggest threat is
[1:53:34.040 --> 1:53:39.560]  not being himself but also us demanding he be jesus christ delivering perfect
[1:53:39.560 --> 1:53:43.560]  nirvana on a golden platter you know with a silver spoon
[1:53:43.560 --> 1:53:46.920]  it's up to us to be the bulldogs here and to enforce this
[1:53:46.920 --> 1:53:50.840]  his biggest achilles heel is that we're not still enthusiastic enough
[1:53:50.840 --> 1:53:55.160]  backing the untold victories we've had like a great supreme court justice
[1:53:55.160 --> 1:53:58.520]  like the tpp dead like a three trillion the stock market
[1:53:58.520 --> 1:54:03.320]  like 43 percent down any legals coming in on and on and on
[1:54:03.320 --> 1:54:06.760]  well alex uh... you know let's put this in some perspective you had bill clinton
[1:54:06.760 --> 1:54:10.840]  who was a serial rapist who assaulted numerous women yet we're saying
[1:54:10.840 --> 1:54:14.200]  donald trump is meant to be unfit but let's think about that
[1:54:14.200 --> 1:54:19.400]  for just a moment that this is uh classic where they want to uh
[1:54:19.400 --> 1:54:23.640]  remove the president not because of his actions or his manners but because of
[1:54:23.640 --> 1:54:27.160]  his beliefs so threatens the new world order
[1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:32.440]  he so threatens uh the fact that they now have to connive and scheme and plot
[1:54:32.440 --> 1:54:34.680]  to get anything done worse before
[1:54:34.680 --> 1:54:39.000]  you know under obama under clinton under the bushes that they had their agenda
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:43.000]  at every step of the way so the people who run this country for 30 years
[1:54:43.000 --> 1:54:46.280]  are not going to go away easily uh and they
[1:54:46.280 --> 1:54:50.920]  they culturally at the spies down from this is in the fetus
[1:54:50.920 --> 1:54:55.080]  phenomenon exactly they don't like the image of a man standing up and the
[1:54:55.080 --> 1:54:58.840]  people standing up so even if he rolled over they're going to destroy him and
[1:54:58.840 --> 1:55:02.600]  again trump understands that right roger i mean i i i love his family avonka
[1:55:02.600 --> 1:55:05.880]  and others love the death don't they get kissing the ass of this system
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:09.400]  is going to destroy them that shows weakness we look at bill marr
[1:55:09.400 --> 1:55:12.520]  and all them turning on her as soon as she sells her dad out
[1:55:12.520 --> 1:55:16.840]  has she figured out disloyalty is the kiss of death
[1:55:16.840 --> 1:55:21.320]  well i'm going to defend both avonka and jared only in the sense that the bad
[1:55:21.320 --> 1:55:25.320]  advice they keep giving the president he attempts to moderate him as she put it
[1:55:25.320 --> 1:55:29.080]  the new york times the the the idea of coming to grip
[1:55:29.080 --> 1:55:32.440]  yeah avonka we didn't hire you to moderate your dad sweetheart
[1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:36.440]  sorry no i don't want i don't want a moderated donald trump i want the guy
[1:55:36.440 --> 1:55:40.760]  we elected that's not i he doesn't need any moderation we need the real trump i
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:45.080]  say let trump be trump that's the success is that i want him to be more
[1:55:45.080 --> 1:55:48.280]  aggressive than the campaign well it's only when he's talked into being
[1:55:48.280 --> 1:55:52.440]  committed or into in the calling back that that you know they don't do well
[1:55:52.440 --> 1:55:56.600]  the president was elected for a reason on a set of remember the first debate
[1:55:56.600 --> 1:56:01.880]  where he was nice to hillary lost it uh exact exactly right so i think that
[1:56:01.880 --> 1:56:05.080]  we're now in a situation in which those who say oh
[1:56:05.080 --> 1:56:10.200]  jared and avonka can never be displaced i'm not sure that's right
[1:56:10.200 --> 1:56:15.320]  let's see how their the results of their bad advice plays out when the president
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:19.080]  unfortunately takes it exactly let me stop you there because we talk about you
[1:56:19.080 --> 1:56:21.960]  and i and us we're all being censored we're being blocked because we are
