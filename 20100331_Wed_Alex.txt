[00:56.000 --> 01:03.280]  important news and continue to break down the clear fact that the federal
[01:03.280 --> 01:10.560]  government is staging provocateur events to prepare the public mind for
[01:10.560 --> 01:17.680]  staged terror attacks very very soon to be blamed on the Tea Party slash anti
[01:17.680 --> 01:23.560]  New World Order movement and of course yours truly there were five mainstream
[01:23.560 --> 01:31.400]  news articles yesterday two of them from Fox News alone in their terrorist
[01:31.400 --> 01:40.160]  section the terror section of Fox News dot com attacking yours truly in a very
[01:40.160 --> 01:46.320]  deceptive way and Fox News admits in one of the articles and these are by the way
[01:46.320 --> 01:52.880]  both been linked up on drugs one of them is still up there they specifically say
[01:52.880 --> 02:01.760]  that Fox News reported us to Homeland Security no doubt Glenn Beck is behind
[02:01.760 --> 02:07.280]  this absolutely no doubt because they know I'm here exposing the fact that
[02:07.280 --> 02:10.520]  they control the right and Obama controls the left and they're all in the
[02:10.520 --> 02:17.040]  same team and we're exposing that they are clearly staging these events the
[02:17.040 --> 02:24.360]  stack attack a few months ago in Austin the Pentagon attack of course two years
[02:24.360 --> 02:30.240]  ago we exposed that the Mumbai terror attack was staged and that was also in
[02:30.240 --> 02:34.920]  Indian newspapers and German newspapers well here it is from JBS.org a great
[02:34.920 --> 02:39.160]  piece of journalism by Alex Newman Mumbai terrorist was US agent it is now
[02:39.160 --> 02:44.120]  admitted in mainstream news they just report on what's hidden in plain view
[02:44.120 --> 02:53.240]  that David Coleman Hadley was a US government agent running the attacks
[02:53.240 --> 03:00.480]  running the attacks so it turns out that I was right Webster Tarpley was right
[03:00.480 --> 03:04.440]  Paul Watson was right and all the other expert guests we had on were right this
[03:04.440 --> 03:13.280]  was a US British slash Israeli operation meant to be blamed on Pakistan as a
[03:13.280 --> 03:18.480]  pretext to bring more US forces into the country and increase predator drone
[03:18.480 --> 03:25.120]  attacks and let me explain something I've had feds show up when I'm just there
[03:25.120 --> 03:29.400]  with a video camera at a military event legally and lawfully to cover it and
[03:29.400 --> 03:35.600]  start trying to set fires to blame it on me my cameraman can't go to Pittsburgh
[03:35.600 --> 03:39.000]  without the police and military saying they were trying to attack the military
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.360]  base just completely made up I mean this has happened to me this has happened to

[12:45.760 --> 12:50.360]  guilty plea ensures that there will be no drawn-out trial that could publicly
[12:50.360 --> 12:55.480]  reveal any relationships with various intelligence agencies notably the
[12:55.480 --> 13:05.320]  central intelligence agency and linked pakistan inter service intelligence he

[13:14.120 --> 13:18.320]  terrorist teams boat landings along the coast and more he was also helping to
[13:18.320 --> 13:24.440]  plan an attack on a danish cartoonist that was all part of the fake fear to get
[13:24.440 --> 13:27.840]  the riots going and while the federal group investigation was given almost 10
[13:27.840 --> 13:31.800]  hours of questioning the only surviving attacker in india a team of indian
[13:31.800 --> 13:36.880]  investigators who traveled the US to interrogate Hadley was turned away i'm
[13:36.880 --> 13:47.040]  gonna go over this more later it's just it's always the same here's the times of
[13:47.040 --> 13:52.240]  London FBI lured dimwits into terror plot the arrest of petty crooks over
[13:52.240 --> 13:55.720]  planned to target Jews has put the use of sting operations under fire these
[13:55.720 --> 14:01.280]  aren't sting operations they go find welfare people quasi homeless in some
[14:01.280 --> 14:10.280]  cases they give them millions of dollars drugs livers ferrari's to just talk
[14:10.280 --> 14:15.160]  about how they were planning violence and and i have studied the hillbilly
[14:15.160 --> 14:19.280]  militias that doesn't mean all the militias but the certain type of militia
[14:19.280 --> 14:27.480]  i have been to events land rights events proto tea party events where there
[14:27.480 --> 14:34.360]  are militia people and you can spot the feds leading them and the feds that
[14:34.360 --> 14:39.360]  lead these militias are always co-intel pro and always attack me i'll be there
[14:39.360 --> 14:44.000]  telling militia groups look don't call for violence this happened in several
[14:44.000 --> 14:49.920]  cases happened once with a standoff with the gray family and they had these so
[14:49.920 --> 14:55.280]  called militia commanders there saying alex is a fed don't listen to him you
[14:55.280 --> 15:00.680]  know he's bad and then it came out in major newspapers in texas that those
[15:00.680 --> 15:07.120]  guys were quote former sheriff's deputies and that it was an intelligence
[15:07.120 --> 15:12.720]  operation i mean but it doesn't matter they know how to go to well meaning but
[15:12.720 --> 15:17.880]  ignorant uneducated hillbilly people and just totally play them i mean i just i've
[15:17.880 --> 15:23.400]  been doing this for 14 almost 15 years immersed in it i have been there i have
[15:23.400 --> 15:30.440]  seen basically everything and i told you monday and tuesday i said this was
[15:30.440 --> 15:42.600]  role-playing with the hatari you get a tiny militia they think the end of the
[15:42.600 --> 15:45.600]  world's coming they start arming themselves getting ready for the end of
[15:45.600 --> 15:49.120]  the world a lot of really poor people do this now because it's like a cop out
[15:49.120 --> 15:53.800]  from the bills going unpaid and financial problems it doesn't matter the
[15:53.800 --> 15:59.840]  end of the world's about to happen and so they just get out in the woods and
[15:59.840 --> 16:04.120]  hunker down and then in come the feds and i predicted monday and tuesday that
[16:04.120 --> 16:08.720]  it would be an interface from another militia fed run and then Anderson
[16:08.720 --> 16:13.280]  cooper last night there they were with all their southern prairie law center
[16:13.280 --> 16:18.280]  experts and others saying oh yes it was actually other militias that tipped us
[16:18.280 --> 16:23.560]  off and now we have the wall street journal it was an fbi informant posing
[16:23.560 --> 16:28.840]  as another militia leader that went in and got them to talk about role-playing
[16:28.840 --> 16:33.400]  like what happens if you ever get attacked or what happens if this end of
[16:33.400 --> 16:41.360]  day scenario unfolds and then the brother of stone from san antonio texas
[16:41.360 --> 16:47.200]  went on anderson cooper as well last night said look my brother made a board
[16:47.200 --> 16:52.920]  game this is all role-playing this is like military reenactments to another
[16:52.920 --> 16:56.680]  level or paintball to another level because the i've been around these
[16:56.680 --> 17:03.320]  people i've seen it one time i got invited out to a shooting range and it
[17:03.320 --> 17:07.920]  was these militia guys and they were all acting like they were rambo and putting
[17:07.920 --> 17:13.640]  you know green caps on their heads and acting all paranoid and and then it was
[17:13.640 --> 17:17.960]  and it was like it was like a it was like a
[17:18.440 --> 17:23.840]  make-believe or something and then i get emails going why are you saying it's
[17:23.840 --> 17:26.760]  stupid to dress up a camo and run around the woods will all these so-called
[17:26.760 --> 17:31.560]  militia groups shoot these videos of themselves and play you know thematic
[17:31.560 --> 17:45.800]  music behind them and camouflage is for southeast asia camouflage is for
[17:45.800 --> 17:50.800]  classical warfare with two armies going up against each other it was the desert
[17:50.800 --> 18:00.520]  it's khaki if it's the mountains it's a gray uniform if it's jungle it's jungle
[18:00.520 --> 18:06.600]  pattern but they they run around in these jungle pattern camo i mean and i
[18:06.600 --> 18:16.200]  always just point out that it's basically like war reenactment the real
[18:16.200 --> 18:27.160]  urban warfare uniform would be a repair man's outfit i mean you imagine people
[18:27.160 --> 18:31.320]  running around in the middle of the city and camouflage
[18:34.760 --> 18:40.520]  it's ridiculous ladies and gentlemen and the modern militia movement and i've
[18:40.520 --> 18:46.600]  really studied it in this country was founded by the feds in the early 1990s
[18:46.600 --> 18:53.960]  they knew that people were going to get armed as they saw the approaching
[18:53.960 --> 18:57.800]  tyranny so they wanted to form the militias have them dressed up in
[18:57.800 --> 19:02.360]  ridiculous mismatched outfits have them run around and make incendiary
[19:02.360 --> 19:05.880]  comments so they could then demonize anybody that was criticizing the
[19:05.880 --> 19:10.440]  government before the feds started bombing their own
[19:10.440 --> 19:13.640]  installations like oklahoma city to then demonize all the different
[19:13.640 --> 19:17.080]  state houses that were speaking out against the un takeover of the national
[19:17.080 --> 19:24.600]  parks and other issues and gun control and the un treaties
[19:24.600 --> 19:31.000]  they led the opposition most of these big militia groups are fed
[19:31.000 --> 19:36.040]  run it's just a bunch of federal informants
[19:36.040 --> 19:40.040]  you look at them it's a bunch of crooks i've been to events i've met these
[19:40.040 --> 19:45.160]  people they're cops they're dirty cops out there trying to find
[19:45.160 --> 19:48.280]  well-meaning christians they can set up and destroy
[19:48.280 --> 19:51.240]  and of course we've been proven right again about this
[19:51.240 --> 19:55.320]  and so they find a bunch of hillbillies and get them to talk about different
[19:55.320 --> 20:00.440]  scenarios and they send them all to prison makes me sick

[24:26.920 --> 24:30.440]  of the militia there are a lot of good militias a lot of great patriots
[24:30.440 --> 24:35.480]  who are out there educating people spreading the words saying that they
[24:35.480 --> 24:38.360]  want to help the local sheriff they want to stand up against
[24:38.360 --> 24:41.240]  criminality you had the minute men that are for
[24:41.240 --> 24:43.800]  real that the feds have set up and arrested and had
[24:43.800 --> 24:48.120]  illegals assault them and then they criminally charge these ranch owners
[24:48.120 --> 24:51.960]  they try to take their property there have been hundreds of ranches that have
[24:51.960 --> 24:54.760]  had their homes burned i mean every few months i see an
[24:54.760 --> 25:00.840]  article where southern arizona 14 homes burned down over the night by
[25:00.840 --> 25:04.520]  illegals and it was an article
[25:04.520 --> 25:11.640]  yesterday where a rancher was murdered illegal immigrants suspected in
[25:11.640 --> 25:16.120]  murder of arizona rancher there's another report out
[25:16.120 --> 25:20.440]  today lawmakers demand administration deploy national guard border patrol
[25:20.440 --> 25:24.680]  after killing of course that was in arizona i've had the
[25:24.680 --> 25:29.560]  sheriffs in three different cases on in south texas who've had
[25:29.560 --> 25:33.320]  mexican troops come two miles three miles six miles
[25:33.320 --> 25:41.160]  over the border and surround their squad cars and point guns to their heads
[25:41.160 --> 25:43.560]  and take away drug shipments that the police had
[25:43.560 --> 25:46.920]  interdicted and it will be in the local paper that's how we
[25:46.920 --> 25:50.120]  find out about it but it's never national news i mean you talk about a
[25:50.120 --> 25:54.920]  real criminal operation serious danger
[25:54.920 --> 26:00.600]  i read the san antonio express news last week here on air in fact here it is
[26:00.600 --> 26:05.080]  drug war is killing mexico border cities it's just completely collapsing
[26:05.080 --> 26:08.280]  almost everything's boarded up the hotels are shut down
[26:08.280 --> 26:11.720]  it was pretty nice down there 10 15 years ago it's just it's
[26:11.720 --> 26:14.760]  i mean you talk about a real threat but no the feds can't be down there at the
[26:14.760 --> 26:17.240]  border they stick their tail between their legs when
[26:17.240 --> 26:21.480]  somebody actually shoots at them no they're just out setting up
[26:21.480 --> 26:24.840]  poor people that are scared of the new world order and rightfully so
[26:24.840 --> 26:30.760]  all over this country i've seen it so many times i've had them try it with me
[26:30.760 --> 26:35.080]  i've had feds as i talked about yesterday in one case in florida
[26:35.080 --> 26:37.880]  i'm just there trying to cover a military drill in the city
[26:37.880 --> 26:41.480]  and a guy just runs up and starts lighting fires the things
[26:41.480 --> 26:46.200]  saying i'm doing it and i'm having to like stomp on it and physically push the
[26:46.200 --> 26:49.560]  guy to the ground and say get away from me i mean it's it's and it turned out
[26:49.560 --> 26:52.360]  the guy was an admitted fed i mean feds just run up with
[26:52.360 --> 26:56.200]  lighters and start lighting things i mean do you have any idea how criminal
[26:56.200 --> 27:01.080]  these people are do you have any idea how dangerous they are
[27:01.640 --> 27:06.040]  that's why you can call it a military reenactment club you can call it a
[27:06.040 --> 27:09.320]  shooting club you can call it a marksman club and it better be your
[27:09.320 --> 27:12.600]  brother your cousin and people you know him for 20 years
[27:12.600 --> 27:15.720]  and it's good to have friends and to say we're going to stick together of society
[27:15.720 --> 27:19.320]  collapses but the way to change things is political you
[27:19.320 --> 27:23.320]  you put all the energy you do into all these military drills running around in
[27:23.320 --> 27:25.960]  the woods
[27:25.960 --> 27:30.280]  you put your energy into that and you're not going to be constantly
[27:30.280 --> 27:33.800]  surrounded by a bunch of feds that are trying to radicalize you and
[27:33.800 --> 27:36.840]  trying to get you to talk about scenarios and that and and that's what
[27:36.840 --> 27:39.880]  the leader of the hutari militias brother said
[27:39.880 --> 27:44.200]  he said look they they did all sorts of scenarios
[27:44.200 --> 27:47.720]  and now it's coming out they did scenarios of russians invading chinese
[27:47.720 --> 27:50.920]  invading and then the federal informant
[27:50.920 --> 27:57.240]  talk them in to hypothetically talking about a ridiculous scenario
[27:57.240 --> 28:01.240]  where they would go surveil the police station and then if the police
[28:01.240 --> 28:05.560]  ever harassed them or or or or ever went after any of their members
[28:05.560 --> 28:09.480]  that they would then kill one and then there would be a funeral
[28:09.480 --> 28:12.680]  procession and they would have hypothetical bombs blowing it up
[28:12.680 --> 28:17.880]  it's basically like christian dungeons and dragons
[28:17.880 --> 28:21.240]  when i was growing up i only played a few times but lots of neighborhood kids
[28:21.240 --> 28:24.760]  did the for hours i wanted to be outdoors playing baseball or something
[28:24.760 --> 28:27.880]  you know these kids would sit around and imagining dragons they were fighting
[28:27.880 --> 28:31.560]  and different magical powers they had and now people play video games and strategy
[28:31.560 --> 28:33.720]  games
[28:33.720 --> 28:37.960]  space battles you name it but i've noticed these adult men
[28:37.960 --> 28:40.840]  kind of fall into the culture of wanting to be some type of military
[28:40.840 --> 28:44.040]  commander and and you know they're preparing for all of
[28:44.040 --> 28:47.560]  this and then they have these scenarios just like homeland security and urban
[28:47.560 --> 28:50.920]  warfare drills i've been to them where the scenarios are to take on the
[28:50.920 --> 28:54.520]  american people you know that was in the new york times you just google
[28:54.520 --> 28:58.440]  fact do this for me it's the top link homeland security boy scouts
[28:58.440 --> 29:01.560]  and the top link that comes up as i checked it this morning is that new
[29:01.560 --> 29:06.120]  york times story where in the first line it says
[29:06.120 --> 29:11.320]  that the boy scouts are being trained to take on disgruntled veterans
[29:11.320 --> 29:17.080]  now there's the government drilling to kill veterans does that mean the
[29:17.080 --> 29:21.080]  government's going out to kill veterans well yeah they do sometimes
[29:21.080 --> 29:28.120]  we have the myack of homeland security reports that's the number one enemy
[29:28.120 --> 29:31.400]  but it's the same thing these these militias get talked into
[29:31.400 --> 29:35.480]  hypothetical drills and then the fbi sets them up and says well that was
[29:35.480 --> 29:38.520]  actually your plan and that's what all their
[29:38.520 --> 29:41.080]  neighbors and friends and everybody you're saying
[29:41.080 --> 29:44.440]  is that these guys couldn't build a black powder bomb
[29:44.440 --> 29:48.040]  much less some giant ied and they're using that term saying they're like
[29:48.040 --> 29:54.520]  american al-qaeda we're on the march the empire's on the run

[34:06.600 --> 34:10.840]  probing going on right now and why are they going after us
[34:10.840 --> 34:17.240]  that's most important because we understand their operation

[35:33.800 --> 35:37.880]  and reduce population that's all stated club of rome un
[35:37.880 --> 35:44.920]  prince philip prince charles ted turner bill gates all of them it's on record
[35:44.920 --> 35:48.680]  they don't tell you from the controlled right wing that the insurance companies
[35:48.680 --> 35:51.800]  wrote this legislation i happen to have a list here
[35:51.800 --> 35:55.640]  of their lobbying all the major insurance companies
[35:55.640 --> 35:58.600]  wrote the bill and lobbied for it we're going to go over numbers coming up
[35:58.600 --> 36:03.640]  later in the broadcast you see if you come at it from the truth
[36:03.640 --> 36:06.360]  none of these liberals are going to support it when you finally explain it
[36:06.360 --> 36:11.640]  cuts medicare and medicaid and raises your taxes
[36:11.640 --> 36:15.560]  but you come at it oh this the insurance companies are against this
[36:15.560 --> 36:19.000]  oh then the moron left the grassroots thinks they're
[36:19.000 --> 36:22.920]  you know robbing some rich person well they're all for it
[36:22.920 --> 36:25.560]  and they sit there in line of their right wing constituents and tell them the
[36:25.560 --> 36:30.120]  insurance companies are good and uh you know this is just a
[36:30.120 --> 36:33.720]  socialization no it's far worse than that see they're real mad that i'm here
[36:33.720 --> 36:36.440]  beating that drum they're mad i'm pointing out the real government the
[36:36.440 --> 36:39.560]  illegitimate government is the banks they're mad i'm talking about the
[36:39.560 --> 36:42.920]  pension funds they're robbing and getting ready to rob them all
[36:42.920 --> 36:46.520]  they're angry that we'll go up to say a city bank
[36:46.520 --> 36:49.880]  website a listener will email us hey look at this link they say they're going
[36:49.880 --> 36:52.680]  to start holding people's money for seven days now all the banks are saying
[36:52.680 --> 36:55.560]  this we'll write an article about it dredge report links to it
[36:55.560 --> 36:59.160]  they're mad about that a lot of original news
[36:59.160 --> 37:03.960]  is generated from this radio show like the mayak at homeland security reports
[37:03.960 --> 37:08.120]  and the clergy response teams and countless other big breaking stories
[37:08.120 --> 37:12.840]  that really expose what's going on and i'll also take their conditioning
[37:12.840 --> 37:16.280]  articles like the new york times saying oh look boy scouts are training to take
[37:16.280 --> 37:20.360]  on disgruntled veterans and kill them isn't this wonderful i'll say no this
[37:20.360 --> 37:24.040]  isn't wonderful nazi germany did this whole pots
[37:24.040 --> 37:28.840]  cambodia did the seat i'm not even that smart i've just
[37:28.840 --> 37:33.000]  studied history i know common sense i know what we're
[37:33.000 --> 37:37.640]  dealing with and they're mad they are hopping mad ladies and gentlemen
[37:37.640 --> 37:40.680]  they're hopping mad we're reaching several million people a week and that is a
[37:40.680 --> 37:44.200]  conservative number when they're really mad about the fact
[37:44.200 --> 37:47.640]  that we're reaching hundreds and hundreds of thousands of new people
[37:47.640 --> 37:52.200]  every week and that we're exponentially growing they can look at all the graphs
[37:52.200 --> 37:58.440]  of shout cast and alexa and all the other big sites and and google analytics
[37:58.440 --> 38:02.680]  and they can look at us going up like a rocket
[38:03.560 --> 38:08.280]  and i am like an info war cruise missile
[38:08.360 --> 38:12.360]  you know what happens to the missile as well as its target but is it scaring
[38:12.360 --> 38:18.280]  me no i'm in my little computer system at info wars
[38:18.280 --> 38:22.760]  tracking the terrain following radar system
[38:22.760 --> 38:27.000]  we're tied into our gps navigation the discernment god gives us
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.400]  and we're tracking and the missile little ram jet is
[38:31.400 --> 38:36.120]  firing every few seconds and keeping us right on course as we blast right
[38:36.120 --> 38:40.120]  through enemy territory going straight at the eye of the new world order
[38:40.120 --> 38:44.760]  and believe me it doesn't like it because i'm not just one missile in the info
[38:44.760 --> 38:48.920]  war we are teaching people how to
[38:48.920 --> 38:51.640]  create their own weapons factories in the info war
[38:51.640 --> 38:55.160]  and then deploy the systems
[38:55.320 --> 38:59.240]  and info warriors are everywhere popping up from behind rocks
[38:59.240 --> 39:02.440]  with their tank buster missiles and blasting corruption
[39:02.440 --> 39:06.520]  exposing corrupt cops drug dealing government land grabbing government
[39:06.520 --> 39:09.880]  taking over the state houses educating people about the new world order
[39:09.880 --> 39:13.960]  you are out there in army of info warriors popping up from behind rocks
[39:13.960 --> 39:19.640]  you have the initiative you're unstoppable and you're smashing the enemy
[39:25.560 --> 39:30.120]  and they know it another analogy it's like 10 000 x wings going in against the
[39:30.120 --> 39:34.760]  death star and that's why they're not quite sure
[39:34.760 --> 39:37.880]  how to come at me they want to demonize me they want to claim on pushing
[39:37.880 --> 39:41.640]  violence that's been their main attack profile
[39:41.640 --> 39:44.600]  they listen to my phones they track everything i do
[39:44.600 --> 39:49.240]  all they can do is frame me for something who knows what it will be
[39:49.240 --> 39:52.600]  but folks are going to see through that
[39:52.680 --> 39:57.320]  and i got god on my side so i'm not worried about it whatever god's will is
[39:57.320 --> 40:01.000]  you know if i'm to die in a car wreck today driving home or if i'm to live to
[40:01.000 --> 40:04.920]  be 95 years old or if i'm to be grabbed and tortured
[40:04.920 --> 40:08.360]  and drug off to some gulag that's just the way it is
[40:08.360 --> 40:12.600]  i cannot stop fighting this evil
[40:16.360 --> 40:20.440]  the most important thing for you to understand is
[40:20.440 --> 40:23.320]  all of us working together many hands make light work
[40:23.320 --> 40:27.560]  that's how we're going to bring down this new world order and we've got
[40:27.560 --> 40:31.240]  fellow freedom lovers truth tellers people that love justice and have a
[40:31.240 --> 40:36.040]  heart of gold and who love god
[40:36.760 --> 40:40.520]  our people are everywhere within the system they are so angry that kurt
[40:40.520 --> 40:44.200]  hashgold was a 9-11 truther with his wife and was on board
[40:44.200 --> 40:47.800]  that aircraft and and saw them get the the underwear bomber
[40:47.800 --> 40:53.320]  the son of the ambassador the son of the government official on board
[40:53.320 --> 40:57.240]  and that they discovered the second bomb and the other assets on board the
[40:57.240 --> 40:59.240]  plane and that other witnesses backed him up
[40:59.240 --> 41:02.760]  and the fbi lied for a month and a half in the state department admitted okay
[41:02.760 --> 41:06.360]  us intelligence told us to help him get on the plane
[41:06.360 --> 41:09.320]  they're hopping mad that more than half the population
[41:09.320 --> 41:14.360]  conservatively or 9-11 truth now they're trying to hide that fact
[41:14.360 --> 41:17.480]  but the polls show it's even higher than that that's conservative and so our
[41:17.480 --> 41:20.840]  people are everywhere and so when they bomb a federal building or they attack
[41:20.840 --> 41:25.080]  an irs building or they kill a bunch of poor cops
[41:25.080 --> 41:29.160]  our people are everywhere in the police departments in the military in the fbi
[41:29.160 --> 41:32.360]  in the federal marshals in in every institution
[41:32.360 --> 41:36.680]  and our numbers are growing and so i've done my work ladies and gentlemen
[41:36.680 --> 41:41.320]  i i pray god continues to let me work in service to humanity and i will
[41:41.320 --> 41:46.040]  continue to move forward with
[41:47.320 --> 41:55.320]  my chest out my chin up but it doesn't matter my work in 14 years
[41:55.320 --> 42:00.920]  of savaging the new world order is a testament to all of what you can do
[42:00.920 --> 42:06.120]  that it takes time it takes commitment and it takes the will and the strength
[42:06.120 --> 42:11.560]  to not care what the crowd thinks of you means nothing of people spit on me
[42:11.560 --> 42:15.400]  it means nothing of people laugh at me
[42:16.600 --> 42:19.160]  and i realized that a lot of the public are like teenagers you know when you're
[42:19.160 --> 42:22.760]  12 13 14 you're insecure you don't want to go out to eat with your parents you're
[42:22.760 --> 42:29.320]  embarrassed of them you think everybody's looking at you
[42:29.320 --> 42:32.920]  and i thought when i was 13 14 when i got over that
[42:32.920 --> 42:37.080]  and i i never really got deeply into it like a lot of people i knew did
[42:37.080 --> 42:40.920]  i thought and people grew out of that no the general public the average yuppie
[42:40.920 --> 42:45.560]  or or whatever niche group people are in they're they're not even real people
[42:45.560 --> 42:49.960]  they're they like take it on a roll and they're and they really care
[42:49.960 --> 42:54.040]  what people think about them they really care
[42:55.240 --> 42:58.840]  about what their neighbors think they they're really at a subconscious level
[42:58.840 --> 43:02.120]  scared of the government they know we're in a tyranny
[43:02.120 --> 43:05.960]  at a at a deep level and so they just roll over to whatever happens in like a
[43:05.960 --> 43:12.680]  trained seal they just stand up and clap to whatever
[43:12.680 --> 43:16.200]  new evil is being announced well not me
[43:16.200 --> 43:23.480]  okay not happening this is a battle of ideologies
[43:23.480 --> 43:28.280]  a battle of ideas a battle of the spirit
[43:28.280 --> 43:33.480]  a battle of will that's why 90 plus percent of the globalist operations
[43:33.480 --> 43:38.120]  are psychological they use the lie and deception and twisting
[43:38.120 --> 43:47.080]  we have a weapon much more powerful the truth
[43:47.080 --> 43:51.080]  and if you'll just go out and start shooting your mouth off in grocery store
[43:51.080 --> 43:57.400]  lines at church and and and be bold don't be insecure have a spirit
[43:57.400 --> 44:02.520]  of warning to warn people to to to raise the alarm
[44:02.520 --> 44:09.160]  raise the alarm nothing can stop you it is a certification of that we're on the
[44:09.160 --> 44:12.920]  right track that they're attacking us
[44:14.920 --> 44:19.240]  fox news trolls info wars comments reports alex jones to authorities
[44:19.240 --> 44:23.320]  and watson wrote this quickly wait last night
[44:23.320 --> 44:26.760]  i would ask her memo and paul because i did i checked this yesterday and found
[44:26.760 --> 44:31.000]  it myself you can do a search just put into google
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.280]  or whatever search engine you use
[44:37.640 --> 44:42.680]  hang the president shoot the president
[44:43.800 --> 44:46.680]  kill the president
[44:47.320 --> 44:50.760]  you put that into a search engine you put youtube.com after it
[44:50.760 --> 44:54.840]  you will see thousands of fresh comments saying it
[44:54.840 --> 44:58.840]  none of those people get investigated none of them get visited
[44:58.840 --> 45:02.120]  none of them get harassed
[45:03.560 --> 45:09.160]  you come on info wars dot com or prison planet dot com
[45:09.160 --> 45:12.600]  and you say that stuff
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.720]  not only are you going to get a swat team kicking down your door
[45:17.720 --> 45:21.640]  but i am going to get blamed for it in the media ap
[45:21.640 --> 45:27.080]  Reuters wired magazine fox but this is what's interesting we kept
[45:27.080 --> 45:30.520]  wondering who was trolling because i got three moderators
[45:30.520 --> 45:34.760]  who go through there and anything mildly threatening we erase
[45:34.760 --> 45:40.520]  a lot of us provocateur we follow the ip addresses
[45:40.520 --> 45:44.840]  and we kept wondering who was doing this and other dirty tricks
[45:44.840 --> 45:51.480]  fox news admits that they are on info wars dot com i mean i know from inside
[45:51.480 --> 45:55.720]  fox news that blendbeck has four sub producers some days five
[45:55.720 --> 45:59.000]  that listen to every word of the show they've got a lady that transcribes
[45:59.000 --> 46:02.840]  parts of it they take what i do and then twist it
[46:02.840 --> 46:06.600]  i mean i mean i've confirmed blendbeck is a evil clone
[46:06.600 --> 46:11.720]  of me a doppelganger i mean it's obvious watching him
[46:11.720 --> 46:16.600]  but now we know and now we know that the lady that
[46:16.600 --> 46:20.040]  wrote these articles has done work for beckett fox news
[46:20.040 --> 46:24.600]  so so here we have it publicly admitted into fox news it says fox news
[46:24.600 --> 46:27.640]  saw the comments and reported them to homeland security
[46:27.640 --> 46:32.600]  so so fox news had two articles yesterday
[46:32.600 --> 46:36.440]  reporting info wars dot com to homeland security
[46:36.440 --> 46:41.800]  and you can go to yahoo youtube in fact we even went to some of the fox news
[46:41.800 --> 46:44.840]  radio sites that have comments and found the same stuff
[46:44.840 --> 46:49.880]  but believe me fox news isn't getting visits from the government
[46:49.880 --> 46:54.360]  and the reason they're doing this is it's
[46:54.360 --> 46:57.800]  they put both these articles in the terrorism section remember it was fox
[46:57.800 --> 47:00.200]  news four years ago they started introducing the idea
[47:00.200 --> 47:04.360]  of white al qaeda
[47:05.000 --> 47:09.000]  and watson just i am to me he must be listening perhaps fox news to check
[47:09.000 --> 47:13.320]  its own website for violent comments and watson is done what i asked him to do
[47:13.320 --> 47:17.240]  last night he has gotten the comments and he has
[47:17.240 --> 47:21.800]  gotten
[47:21.800 --> 47:27.400]  the evidence and posted and he's gotten news clips of them joking about
[47:27.400 --> 47:31.720]  killing obama on fox news
[47:37.320 --> 47:40.520]  in a response to another fox news article in fact watson they're going to
[47:40.520 --> 47:43.080]  expunge these you need to get screenshots of every one of
[47:43.080 --> 47:46.840]  these on your listening and save it or they'll say it's not real response to
[47:46.840 --> 47:50.200]  another fox nation article respondents call for marines to
[47:50.200 --> 47:54.360]  start killing people as part of a bloody revolution
[47:55.240 --> 47:58.200]  look fox news is an intelligence operation they've got some people there
[47:58.200 --> 48:01.480]  that aren't under their full control but they only mix them in people like
[48:01.480 --> 48:03.640]  napolitano to try to give themselves some type of
[48:03.640 --> 48:06.120]  credibility
[48:08.760 --> 48:16.120]  the point is fox news is on my website looking for of literally hundreds of
[48:16.120 --> 48:21.000]  thousands of comments looking for comments mild compared to comments on
[48:21.000 --> 48:24.040]  their own websites to then report us to homeland
[48:24.040 --> 48:28.040]  security so they can write articles implying we're behind it and we're doing
[48:28.040 --> 48:33.880]  it we support it like the statesman by the afternoon
[48:33.880 --> 48:37.880]  of the joe stack attack a few months ago in austin
[48:37.880 --> 48:43.000]  on the irs building the statesman like we can pull the article up but it
[48:43.000 --> 48:46.200]  the paraphrase it said many websites are praising it
[48:46.200 --> 48:51.160]  period info wars dot com said this you the
[48:51.160 --> 48:56.360]  the way it's written for a person just scanning it is is oh i'm supporting it
[48:56.360 --> 49:00.040]  new york daily news had a headline about websites praising the attack and then
[49:00.040 --> 49:04.200]  put my website in there same thing with a london guardian
[49:04.200 --> 49:07.160]  they know exactly what they're doing because i'm up here pointing out that
[49:07.160 --> 49:09.880]  it's the government provocaturing or completely staging
[49:09.880 --> 49:15.720]  almost all of these events and they're mad ladies and gentlemen they're mad
[49:15.720 --> 49:21.640]  i mean not only does glenn beck have to copy and twist everything i do
[49:21.640 --> 49:26.600]  now they want to get me put in jail that's how glenn beck responds and i've
[49:26.600 --> 49:28.600]  even been trying to not attack glenn beck lately
[49:28.600 --> 49:40.360]  in fact xm sent me a bunch of liners to plug my show and one of them said coming up next glenn beck and i did it
[49:40.360 --> 49:43.560]  i mean you try to say to yourself come on they're not pure evil it's not an
[49:43.560 --> 49:48.120]  intelligence operation and then you find out that
[49:48.120 --> 49:51.880]  glenn beck's people are trying to put me in prison
[49:51.880 --> 49:56.200]  i mean what is your problem you scumbag
[49:56.200 --> 49:59.800]  i i cannot make myself snitch
[49:59.800 --> 50:02.360]  you know if i saw somebody rob my neighbor's house i'd get my gun and go
[50:02.360 --> 50:05.960]  over there and try to deal with it myself and then i'd call the cops
[50:05.960 --> 50:11.000]  there was a um gas station openly running whores out of the front of it
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.680]  and drugs was it was a nice gas station suddenly there was hardly any food or
[50:14.680 --> 50:18.760]  magazines or or or or or anything being sold at it
[50:18.760 --> 50:24.440]  this is in south austin off of a man shack when i lived over off man shack
[50:24.440 --> 50:28.520]  and these i think are pakistani spot they were they had hookers out front it was
[50:28.520 --> 50:32.120]  suddenly horrible and i'd pull over next to cop cars running
[50:32.120 --> 50:35.240]  speed checkpoints we're talking 200 yards wednesday they're running whores
[50:35.240 --> 50:38.120]  right there and i've watched them selling drugs
[50:38.120 --> 50:41.000]  and the cops have obviously somebody their commander or something was on the
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.720]  take and they would just say not doing anything about it
[50:43.720 --> 50:47.000]  and i've driven by the whore house the crack house is still running out of a

[55:26.040 --> 55:29.640]  this more number one as predicted fbi agent
[55:29.640 --> 55:34.680]  discovered its center of alleged hutari conspiracy
[55:34.680 --> 55:40.520]  new obama law places soviet style capital controls on americans
[55:40.520 --> 55:44.360]  a clu truancy courts violate the law threatened parents and children
[55:44.360 --> 55:47.240]  they finally discovered what we've been covering for 12 years all over the
[55:47.240 --> 55:51.400]  country they put kids on probation for missing one or two days of school
[55:51.400 --> 55:55.320]  when the truancy law doesn't even say that's truancy
[55:55.320 --> 56:01.080]  and how they harass the children uh and get them into the criminal system
[56:02.280 --> 56:06.680]  but of course fox news trawls info wars comments reports alex jones to
[56:06.680 --> 56:09.640]  authorities and of course we've discovered far more vicious
[56:09.640 --> 56:14.280]  threats all over the fox news sites but they don't care
[56:14.280 --> 56:18.120]  and my point about snitching is i can't even bring myself to tell listeners to
[56:18.120 --> 56:22.760]  call homeland security to call the fbi to go get the article
[56:22.760 --> 56:28.840]  up at um prison planet dot com perhaps fox news should check its own website
[56:28.840 --> 56:33.640]  for violent comments fox news contributors call for obama to be killed
[56:33.640 --> 56:37.240]  and authors to be shot while fox points the finger at alex jones for
[56:37.240 --> 56:41.320]  instigating violence yeah but shon hannity specialty with hell
[56:41.320 --> 56:45.720]  turner his cohort in long island was setting people up
[56:45.720 --> 56:53.240]  in the early and mid 1990s and those two of course worked together
[56:53.240 --> 56:58.200]  and so hannity and i mean they're all it's all an operation i mean fox has
[56:58.200 --> 57:01.720]  government approval to be trying to call for
[57:01.720 --> 57:05.320]  violence to to flesh out people who they can then set up and
[57:05.320 --> 57:08.760]  create the illusion of a violent revolution that's about to happen
[57:08.760 --> 57:13.240]  because they want to have a violent one so they can shut down all serious
[57:13.240 --> 57:15.640]  debate
[57:16.360 --> 57:20.120]  but i tell you i mean if i read these articles on air
[57:20.120 --> 57:24.520]  military husband probe for allegedly posting threats on radical website
[57:24.520 --> 57:28.600]  then the article implies it's my fault
[57:28.600 --> 57:32.840]  here's another one feds investigate death threats to iris employee after health
[57:32.840 --> 57:35.960]  bill approved and then it goes on to imply we're
[57:35.960 --> 57:43.080]  behind it mentions info wars dot com alex jones over and over again
[57:43.080 --> 57:48.520]  how about headlines like fox news calls for killing obama in fact change that
[57:48.520 --> 57:51.960]  lots and lots of i mean let's let's really go i mean come on fox news you
[57:51.960 --> 57:55.800]  can't sit there and take everything i do and twist it and
[57:55.800 --> 57:59.640]  make your fox nation website look just like info wars dot com
[57:59.640 --> 58:03.640]  and then and then try to get me put in prison or shut down i mean you people
[58:03.640 --> 58:06.920]  are sick
[58:06.920 --> 58:09.720]  you're sickening
[58:10.360 --> 58:13.160]  and meanwhile

[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.840]  the militia really works how they're doing a replay of the mid 1990s
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.480]  right now and the stage terror attacks that i believe
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.000]  we're coming in the next few months probably towards the end of next month
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.400]  april by getting the word out we may short circuit their operation that's
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.600]  one reason they're really coming after us right now
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.720]  it's also come out that the moon by attacks were run by a u.s government
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:15.480]  agent that's in the federal affidavit

[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.360]  i guess i'm doing all right that's excellent uh two things very quick and
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:32.200]  then i'll take your answers off the air number one a question for you i have a
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:36.440]  loved and intelligent family member who is exceedingly liberal
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.000]  and cannot see through the constant smokescreen omitted by mainstream media
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.360]  concerning violence toward the current administration
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:48.840]  uh allegedly being committed by patriots like us
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:52.120]  could you please give me some advice and some links
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:55.480]  about past and present manipulation to demonize
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:02:00.040]  any certain group um uh for alleged violence
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.640]  to fulfill their own agenda and number two uh and very quickly
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:09.480]  i hear you often as a guest on another uh hugely popular morning show
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:13.640]  uh it would seem that you sometimes i hate to even say this because i'll
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:19.480]  leave you so much sensationalize or try to grab the attention of the listener
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:22.440]  if i could give you a little bit of a critique mr. jones i was to you for
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.040]  about five years i'm a huge follower i make flyers i post articles
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:29.960]  could you just calm down a bit sometimes when you're on that show
[01:02:29.960 --> 01:02:33.880]  and and just give the facts instead of trying to really get your point across
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:36.200]  because sometimes i listen to you on that show
[01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:40.680]  and you sound like a wholly different person than you do on your own show
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.800]  and if you're trying to garner listeners from that show
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:48.680]  maybe you should be that same person that you are on the alex jones show
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:51.080]  okay let's be clear you're talking about man cow
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.280]  yes i am yeah i was on there for like 50 minutes this morning
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.280]  have you noticed i get about 30 seconds and then he goes to something else for
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.760]  about two minutes and i'm back for 30 seconds
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.480]  i am trying to get it is sensational that laptops that schools are giving kids
[01:03:05.480 --> 01:03:08.600]  are watching men at home it is sensational that scouts are
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:12.600]  training to fight terrorist and more in the new york times the next line says
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:16.360]  taking on and killing disgruntled veterans it is sensational that

[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.240]  frankly matthew i i think you're here giving me advice
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.880]  and perhaps i am a little bit more astute at this than you
[01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:38.760]  uh but if you listen to the format of that
[01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:42.280]  that's a short attention span theater radio show
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.040]  where they jump back and forth between other guests and other news clips
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.800]  and so that's the format of the show you'll say
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.160]  what is the end game of the new world order and i will say to bring in an
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:56.360]  oppressive planetary regime and kill 80 of the population

[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:46.360]  the enemy belligerent interrogation detention and prosecution act of 2010
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:51.160]  that states that u.s citizens for any potential intelligence reason or such

[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:13.240]  or their release that is sensational what is it about
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:17.160]  governments killing hundreds of millions of people last century
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:20.840]  and world government openly being announced by a bunch of eugenicists

[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.760]  environmental laws because quote the public's too stupid to allow the
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.280]  government to do it and that we need an elite group to control our lives
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:44.200]  or the financial times of london with the headline and now for world
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.400]  government saying it needs to be authoritarian yes we built it in
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:51.560]  secret for your own good that is sensational
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:56.600]  they tell you to be calm and just oh don't get upset and don't get angry or
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.560]  oh it may cause violence no it may cause people
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:02.600]  to wake up and then matthew had another question
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:07.160]  he said well i've got a family member who's a liberal and there's
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:12.520]  all these violent attacks threats people being called the n word going on
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:16.680]  uh democratic office is being attacked you know how do i get through to them
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.800]  that most of this is staged well you listen to the show and you hear me read

[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.400]  offices and then it goes on to say it was people
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:36.440]  that work there that did it or you just search the term
[01:10:36.440 --> 01:10:41.640]  uh black fraternity spray painted swastikas on their own building
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.280]  you'll get a whole bunch of cases of it or
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:49.960]  jewish students spray painted swastika or put swastika on her own dorm room
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:52.920]  and the school got video of it i mean i don't i mean
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.960]  number one there were hundreds of cameras in that chamber when those
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.680]  congressmen supposedly i call the n word and
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:01.880]  there's no recordings of it no video of it
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:04.920]  one guy just says it happened so what if it happened
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:10.520]  people are always calling each other names it turns into a bunch of ninnies
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.640]  that if somebody says something it's the end of the world you know why don't black
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.160]  people get upset about 52 percent of blacks never being born
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.520]  in this country since roe v wade more blacks being aborted
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:24.760]  that are born that's another reason the system doesn't like me i actually don't
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:30.600]  want the black people to be dead i don't dislike black people
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.960]  i know black people have been taught to be racist many of them and taught to
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.520]  hate whitey
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:41.880]  i know a lot of hispanics have been taught that i don't hate them
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.920]  i tell it like it is
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.600]  oh but black leaders will all get up in arms
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.040]  saying somebody called him an n word but meanwhile those black leaders push for
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.920]  the abortion rules and the abortion funding to kill
[01:11:56.920 --> 01:12:00.600]  more than half their people let's get our priorities
[01:12:00.600 --> 01:12:03.640]  set here i was watching anderson cooper last night because you heard the
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:08.120]  producer say it didn't air friday but it should air tonight
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:12.920]  and it didn't air i could care less
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:18.120]  i just wanted to see what they did and they had doctor phil on for two segments
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:21.560]  talking about bullying and there's a death every month from bullying
[01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:26.040]  why don't people teach their kids to not care if they get bullied
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:31.080]  i mean let me tell you what happened to me i'd get off the school bus
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.920]  at my friend's house this happened a couple times and black guys two or three
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:38.920]  years older would come over and start assaulting us calling us crackers and
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.640]  honkies you think i hate black people because i've
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:47.000]  been racially assaulted by black people no by the time i was 15
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.560]  when black guys came up i i and i learned the joy of beating the hell out of
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.040]  somebody
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:00.920]  now i mean maybe some kids growing up can't deal with this but i'd come home
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:04.280]  with two black guys and a busted lip when i was 12 and my dad would say you
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:09.160]  best better learn to whoop their ass excuse me talking like that
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.440]  i guess i'm just a red-blooded texan i don't know who the rest of you people
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:15.080]  are and you know what if people are bullying your kids at a school get
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.360]  them out of that school who would put their children in a public school
[01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:22.920]  after what i saw in public school the sex the drugs the bullying the fighting
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:27.800]  in dallas texas and it was like worse than any movie i've ever seen about a
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.920]  rough high school and i didn't go to a rough high school
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:33.960]  but let me tell you i didn't just have black people gang up on me
[01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:38.840]  i had mexicans do it i got a pin in my leg
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:41.880]  where four mexicans that were five of them and only four were attacking me

[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:06.840]  excuse me i won't even use that my language i apologize it's just
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.520]  now they're charged nine youths for throwing
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:17.160]  tin cans in the lunch room and calling some irish girl names
[01:14:17.160 --> 01:14:20.360]  and it's wrong what they did but they're being charged with felonies
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:25.000]  and now people are going to say you're kid bullied
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.560]  and they're going to go to jail and then they're going to learn how to be real
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:30.760]  bullies see this is just a way to criminalize
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.320]  everybody

[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:58.760]  trying to imply that i'm doing that and putting me in the terror section
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:02.200]  with two different articles yesterday as a terrorist
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:06.040]  well i think it was the same as them letting have that that complete
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:10.440]  psycho glenn beck have his own tv show on there i mean anybody who can employ
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:16.040]  that guy they're just not getting my book right off the bat
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:19.320]  well they know what they're doing glenn beck is their idea of alex jones i mean
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.960]  i have that from inside fox so he says all these things that are true so you
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.520]  can get your confidence to stab you in the back later
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.240]  yeah he's just there to co-opt everybody into the stinking sarah paleon ship
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:35.320]  so that he can keep obama now if obama if his approval
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.600]  keeps low enough i think they're gonna throw parry in there
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:42.360]  and get obama out otherwise you're gonna see sarah paleon go in there
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:48.040]  and lose yeah look for a sarah paleon rick parry ticket and i've had that from
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:52.280]  inside the republican party in washington and in texas
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:57.640]  and look for a general portray us met romney ticket

[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:20.520]  i believe parry will get the top of the ticket

[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:21.400]  i've been on fire let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:25.080]  herman in new york you're on the air herman welcome
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:28.440]  yes hello alec yearney yes sir
[01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.640]  yes i have quick points that i want to make
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:36.120]  um i think the one solution is that we need to call the senators who are
[01:24:36.120 --> 01:24:40.920]  running under this new uh... patriot party if you will tea party
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:44.680]  movement like petership and others and tell them that is not just
[01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:48.280]  government incompetent that it's actually part of a larger plant
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:52.760]  that is not just washington acting in their own interest in the interest of
[01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:55.560]  big business but this is actually part of a bigger plan
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:58.920]  and my second uh... point i want to make is that
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:02.760]  uh... brocco bomb was just on tv talking about drilling
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:06.440]  uh... he was at the andrews air force be talking about how you can open up
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.920]  drilling now what i think he's going to do
[01:25:08.920 --> 01:25:12.920]  is he's going to get right cover to the leftist agenda of
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:16.200]  cap and trade giving the right something to be happy about with
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:20.360]  fair with this new drilling going on but moving forward
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:24.520]  with uh... bipartisanship on cap and trade what do you think about that
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:28.760]  well i agree with you that's one level of it they've got a new cap and trade
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:32.040]  bill which is just a direct tax on the fuel
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.800]  uh... to to begin this operation but here's the new york times and i'm
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:40.280]  that was in the stack to get to obama to open offshore areas to oil drilling
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:44.920]  for first time but the the main reason they decided to do this
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:48.520]  is those are international waters if you look
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:53.240]  they uh... they have a map on the new york times of the new red areas
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:56.680]  that they're going to allow drilling in the gulf of mexico and also
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:01.400]  uh... in the southern atlantic uh... off of uh... georgia
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:06.280]  and south carolina and alabama if you look at those areas
[01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:09.880]  that's where the russians in the chinese said okay
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:13.000]  they said this in the last two months you're not going to drill there
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.680]  we're launching a huge exploration and drilling operation
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:20.840]  so the oil companies have an oligopoly they have a controlled cartel they want
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:24.600]  to keep prices at a certain point not too high not too low
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:28.440]  and that's what they have deals with the arabs but because russia and china
[01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:32.200]  are now moving in with massive exploration operations
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:36.760]  they're saying okay all right we'll go ahead and move in there
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:44.200]  and so that's the main reason anything else herman
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:48.360]  uh... yes i was watching some videos uh... by jordan maxwell
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:53.000]  and um... he kind of a stop down on my uh... optimism
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  he pretty much said uh... that the population isn't really ready for what's
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:27:00.280]  coming uh... because they really don't understand their enemy to the full
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:02.680]  extent what do you think about that thank you
[01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.960]  i appreciate your call look we don't need even ten percent of the people who
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:07.480]  really know the full
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:10.840]  magnitude of what we're up against a beat this okay
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:14.280]  that's why they have the three percenters of three percent started the war
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:19.000]  five percent that won the war in seventeen seventy five seventeen seventy six
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:23.480]  up until the early uh... seventeen eighties and so we don't have to
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:28.120]  have the entire population you get tens of millions of americans saying no
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.680]  waking others up it's over for the new world order
[01:27:30.680 --> 01:27:33.640]  and they know this radio show is one of the main focal points of that
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:37.560]  and that's why they're coming after us rick in florida you're on the air
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:41.880]  good afternoon alex um... i'm calling to comment on a story that's currently
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:47.160]  posted on info wars dot com about the city of milwaukee police department
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:51.160]  becoming the first in the nation to implement to demand
[01:27:51.160 --> 01:27:56.040]  a biometric fingerprint scan upon encountering law enforcement now i'd
[01:27:56.040 --> 01:27:59.960]  live in milwaukee i'm outraged by the infringement on our fourth amendment
[01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:04.680]  right here i have an attorney i'm going to look into this but what i'm calling
[01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:10.120]  you to tell you is it's not an accident that milwaukee wisconsin was chosen
[01:28:10.120 --> 01:28:14.120]  to implement a beta no i know your your your mayor
[01:28:14.120 --> 01:28:18.920]  two years ago called for martial law when the rest of the council
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:22.840]  wanted to vote against them and it was your governor
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:26.040]  uh... in wisconsin it's it's in police state
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:29.240]  no it's in matrix of evil i have the a p article
[01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:32.760]  where he gave a tour to the media and told a little too much about the threat
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:35.960]  fusion centers and showed how they were tracking everyone
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:39.320]  in that case in green bay he had upon the map green bay
[01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:42.360]  everyone cell phone and where you are in real time
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:47.240]  and how they could dial in and listen to you uh... so he showed a little too much
[01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:50.120]  you're not supposed to show that uh... to everybody
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:53.640]  uh... but uh... go ahead and make your point about milwaukee
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:57.880]  well the police chief the current police chief in milwaukee is ed

[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:21.640]  of other towns and cities thumb scanning people and how do they do it

[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:53.960]  witnesses and video came out of a murdering him and the government

[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:58.040]  and then it's got the uh the the homeland security teaching them how to
[01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:01.400]  make suspects shut up there's a quote in here about

[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:08.040]  knee in the middle of his back that will shut him up
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:12.200]  and then you click on the photos and it shows the dead veterans
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.320]  the the the the mock simulated dead veterans
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:19.160]  and this guy's just still screaming you're a liar you're a liar you're a liar

[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:10.600]  this is one of the key hallmarks of a super corrupt super oppressive
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:16.120]  authoritarian system and these people are in denial
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:21.320]  i was on that show about a month ago and i was on some other shows and i would
[01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:25.560]  mention laptops watching kids at home that the government had given them
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:29.400]  and in the show say oh that's not true until later it comes out and then they're
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:35.400]  okay with it not man count himself but his sidekick
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:40.040]  it's just so frustrating dealing with childlike minds

[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:00.440]  yes are they going to take uh everything like the ira's and everything
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:03.080]  like that your investments they're going to take
[01:44:03.080 --> 01:44:06.280]  everything and then they're going to control it and then only give you a
[01:44:06.280 --> 01:44:11.080]  small percentage back okay and if you don't like it they're
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:15.720]  going to call you a terrorist so if i take my money out now
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:19.720]  nothing will happen or will they text i mean well there's a lot of this
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:22.680]  health care thing is taxing investment funds
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:25.880]  and savings funds and medical accounts but they're going to try to get it one
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:28.680]  way or the other but more and more i mean they're
[01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.720]  announcing that your money markets won't be insured
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:35.560]  they're announcing that the federal government is ordering private and public
[01:44:35.560 --> 01:44:40.120]  uh and union uh pension funds to be invested quoted failed banks that's
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:43.240]  business week uh that's world that daily obama's
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:46.520]  giving speeches about it how he's going to protect your money but of course put
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:50.760]  a juicy tax on it okay even if i went to silver or gold but
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:54.760]  they're still going to go after that it's a little bit harder for them
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:58.440]  but yeah that they're hiring all their tens of thousands of new agents
[01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:02.680]  and if you resist in any way they're going to kill you and call your terrorist
[01:45:02.680 --> 01:45:07.000]  the i mean this is real jack boot evil
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:10.440]  so there's no way to save your investments then well i mean what do people
[01:45:10.440 --> 01:45:14.200]  think hitler did he robbed everybody what do you think stalin did now
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:18.280]  these are just these are despots this is the real deal
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:21.320]  and i'm not saying they're going to get away with all this but they're certainly
[01:45:21.320 --> 01:45:29.240]  pushing they're certainly trying it i mean it it's certainly going on
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:32.920]  okay that's what that that was my question and i found a couple months
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:35.960]  ago and i've been watching listening to you ever since so
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:41.400]  i'm gonna order some of your movies and um that was my question well thank you
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:46.600]  sue i appreciate your call and we've got to start telling
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:49.800]  it like it is civilizations when that went when when corruption starts
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:54.200]  taking over there's always a denial period
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:57.560]  but you talk to people in asia or latin america or africa who've lived into
[01:45:57.560 --> 01:46:01.000]  this type of system they all know how things work
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:04.760]  there's just paramilitary police suppressing them everywhere
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:11.560]  the wild card is there's so many guns in this country
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:15.320]  so they want to preemptively go out and make any type of armed
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:19.800]  defense or resistance look ridiculous by targeting civilians targeting
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:23.320]  innocent cops that's what this is all about to try to
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:28.520]  preemptively get the violence going early i don't want it to ever happen
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:31.960]  and they always ignore the government's violence or any protected group engaged
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:36.840]  in violence against others i mean notice i'm not a muslim basher here
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:40.360]  and the radical muslims are run and funded and protected by western
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:44.840]  intelligence as a way to menace the west into giving up their freedoms
[01:46:44.840 --> 01:46:48.600]  but if you notice with these railway bombings in russia and others
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:51.880]  they never say muslims they always say from the caucuses
[01:46:51.880 --> 01:46:54.760]  from chechnya
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:59.240]  they never say muslim
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:03.640]  but it's christian christian christian christian christian militia christian
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:09.160]  christian christian christian christian christian christian christian christian
[01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:14.200]  because they want to demonize christianity because it's the dominant
[01:47:14.200 --> 01:47:18.760]  system that's left over here in the u.s
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:25.240]  david south carolina you're on the air hey alex i got a little information for
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:28.920]  you we heard today on the local radio station about how
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:32.440]  they're going to be reassessing property taxes in our county
[01:47:32.440 --> 01:47:35.480]  and they're going to come knocking on every door measuring every house every
[01:47:35.480 --> 01:47:39.400]  outbuilding and trying to gain access to every uh
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:44.440]  domicile home to yeah what the banks do is the banks get the
[01:47:44.440 --> 01:47:48.360]  cities in in debt and then internationally they fly all the
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:52.120]  city managers even to small towns
[01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:55.560]  to these events and then promise them to move up the chain into bigger city
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:00.440]  management if they do what they're told and it's u n agenda 21 zoning
[01:48:00.440 --> 01:48:04.040]  and it's part of obama's environmental plan and just because he can't pass it
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:06.360]  in the senate doesn't mean he's not going to try to implement it
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:09.960]  and the same thing's been announced here in austin people who
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:15.160]  renovated houses 35 years ago in one case i saw in the paper
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:19.720]  in in in one case the house had been sold four separate times
[01:48:19.720 --> 01:48:23.960]  and they came in bullied their way in with an inspection for the new zoning
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:27.800]  and said you've got to pay us fines for renovation done
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:34.600]  in the 1970s and absolutely uh
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:37.800]  in in canada in some u.s cities in illinois
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.960]  and in england the police now come in your house without a warrant
[01:48:41.960 --> 01:48:45.080]  for a safety inspection and then ask about your firearms
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:50.680]  and and and in one illinois paper i saw the the elderly couple woke up with
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:54.120]  with zoning inspector standing in front of their bed
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:58.120]  saying you have three toothbrushes this house is only zone for two people
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:01.480]  so everything is a giant prison do you understand
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:04.360]  yeah i know it shocked my family a lot because they've been pretty disbelief
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:07.320]  for until now that just amazed them that they were going to try to do something
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:10.600]  like that in our county well that these are parasites these are
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:14.200]  hardcore criminals and most small towns have a good old boy group that's been
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:17.400]  sucking off everybody for a hundred years so it's like oh good we get to
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:21.160]  really ride this scum now feds say they're gonna back us up let's get going
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:25.160]  here there's a lot there's a lot to take a lot of kids to take a lot of raping to

[01:49:38.120 --> 01:49:42.120]  we run things now around here
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:46.520]  counter this would be to try to uh get a constitutional lawyer and a couple of
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:50.280]  different homeowners together and try to sue the county or
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:54.200]  you sue the county you call out the good old boys you get in their face at
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:57.240]  restaurants when they're in the coffee shop every day

[01:50:24.120 --> 01:50:27.720]  loaded so we're gonna try to get those out and that's the way it's always been

[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:04.520]  viewers uh let's talk to timon michigan tim you're on the air
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:08.360]  hey alex hey buddy yeah i i talked to you yesterday
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:12.600]  um yeah you uh you're you're uh i like to
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:16.360]  incredible kind of referral is the man on the ground over here in michigan
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:22.040]  there were a couple things that i picked up off of a uh article that i uh got
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:26.040]  out of um the um uh duty ball at the
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:28.840]  washington uh or no the wall street journal
[01:56:28.840 --> 01:56:33.800]  and it had some uh some information in there about uh
[01:56:33.800 --> 01:56:37.960]  i don't know if you caught this alex but this this i think this guy uh
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:43.160]  thomas paitek was our infield trader uh this fb i uh
[01:56:43.160 --> 01:56:46.600]  uh uh provocateur that they slipped in on these people
[01:56:46.600 --> 01:56:50.120]  because if you if you saw the picture of all of them up
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:55.400]  uh together they're all in uh uniform garb uh you know from the jail
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:58.680]  and all dressed the same except for this thomas paitek guy even his
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:02.440]  complexion is different from these people i mean this is really strange i
[01:57:02.440 --> 01:57:05.800]  want to tell you what me my girlfriend ran across an ellipse it was really
[01:57:05.800 --> 01:57:08.520]  strange because after we read this article
[01:57:08.520 --> 01:57:12.200]  about this thomas paitek character and that how
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:15.800]  they had this picture that they posted they said was in sort of some sort of a
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:22.280]  file that was uh uh giving to the uh the grand jury um
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:27.560]  from a what they called a how do they they were that they said it was
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:34.920]  a cooperating witness slash fb i agent and that now we we can figure out
[01:57:34.920 --> 01:57:38.680]  whether they were talking about this paitek character or somebody
[01:57:38.680 --> 01:57:42.280]  that was implying that he was part of it because it was really strange article
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:47.880]  so anderson cooper reported that other militias reported them and and see what
[01:57:47.880 --> 01:57:51.000]  happens is a bunch of the militias especially in michigan are commanded by
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.800]  feds and what they do is go meet with other
[01:57:53.800 --> 01:57:56.760]  militias and try to basically provocateur them
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:57:59.960]  into things and they also spent a lot of their time demonizing yours truly
[01:57:59.960 --> 01:58:03.080]  which is what put me on to aming feds a long time ago
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:07.560]  and i mean it's a mess up in michigan you got to really watch your butt up there
[01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:10.280]  and of course whenever i've been saying that the last 12 plus years since i
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:13.480]  discovered it it's like how dare you say people should watch it all the
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:16.760]  militias are good up here there's no danger jones is a wimp

[02:00:40.840 --> 02:00:48.200]  john burt society magazine newspaper. Mumbai terrorist was us agent
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:53.640]  and of course that comes from the affidavit remember those terror attacks
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:57.240]  almost two years ago blamed on pakistan we told you at the time
[02:00:57.240 --> 02:01:00.760]  it was us israeli and british intel that even came out in indian papers at the
[02:01:00.760 --> 02:01:05.320]  time the head of counterterrorism in india
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:09.080]  was assassinated was killed the day of these attacks
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:13.880]  and he had been saying it was british us israeli run
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:19.800]  that's why that was originally there now in fact well you guys call watson and
[02:01:19.800 --> 02:01:22.520]  have him send all the articles that curtain watson wrote
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:25.400]  almost two years ago on that because i want to have all the names and i can
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:28.520]  highlight it the name of the counterterrorism head
[02:01:28.520 --> 02:01:31.480]  of course they kept his butt good he was there trying to stop it but he
[02:01:31.480 --> 02:01:35.640]  couldn't go up against cia massad m i6 i mean you can't you can't go up against
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:40.200]  their muslim terror forces i mean they they just continue to devastate everywhere
[02:01:40.200 --> 02:01:43.960]  they attack the russians they attack 9 11 they attack everybody
[02:01:43.960 --> 02:01:47.160]  train bombings everything sometimes they've got real muslim nuts working
[02:01:47.160 --> 02:01:51.240]  for them usually it's just totally staged
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:57.080]  all you can do is expose them but uh we've got the affidavit in
[02:01:57.080 --> 02:02:01.720]  fact you printed me both copies or bar printed in two pieces
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:08.200]  oh here it is here's the first piece no this is the indictment of the militia
[02:02:08.200 --> 02:02:11.080]  patsy's i'll find it
[02:02:11.800 --> 02:02:16.280]  so we're going to be covering all of this uh also
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:19.320]  i've mentioned it but i want to get into it briefly again
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:22.840]  and explain why this is happening into the next phase
[02:02:22.840 --> 02:02:28.520]  fox news trolls info wars comments reports alex jones two authorities
[02:02:28.520 --> 02:02:33.240]  writes two front page articles on foxnews.com yesterday
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:38.920]  saying that i am a terrorist basically and that we're calling for violence
[02:02:38.920 --> 02:02:42.280]  and that we're associated with commenters that are doing it
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:46.360]  well paul watson in about five minutes found fox news
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:51.880]  correspondence calling for obama to be killed found people all over their
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:55.240]  articles and comments calling for obama to be killed something we're
[02:02:55.240 --> 02:02:59.080]  saying word against and i've noticed glenn bexman saying
[02:02:59.080 --> 02:03:04.360]  nine eleven truthers are going to try to kill the president
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:08.600]  and i know he copies my show and twist everything we do
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:15.000]  and i know that from inside fox because we have freedom lovers everywhere
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.440]  but now it's clear they're trying to set me up
[02:03:18.440 --> 02:03:22.840]  while they themselves push the violence uh so
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:25.880]  this is really going to a whole other level with seeing an end of any
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:29.160]  investigations on me supposedly creating some attack piece that was going to
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:32.680]  air friday and then last night with all these other big national
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:40.120]  publications attacking us 24 7 this is very very very serious
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:43.880]  what's going on so we're going to be breaking uh all of that down as well
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:47.560]  but um the headline of it prisonplanet.com
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:52.680]  perhaps fox should check into its own website for violent comments
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:56.040]  and derrick einkauf one of the sales guys he went and looked on fox site and
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:59.720]  found even more death threats and violence
[02:03:59.720 --> 02:04:02.280]  and then he was on there today saying look you shouldn't call for violence
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:05.640]  and they said look we'll kill you too
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:09.480]  that's kind of like uh mike reagan could say kill all nine eleven truthers
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:11.960]  kill mark dice i'll pay for the bullets i'll meet you
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:16.280]  there's a bounty on their head the FBI said he's allowed to say kill people
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:19.640]  he's allowed to say kill mark dice
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:23.640]  we're getting together a bunch of screenshots to link up
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:28.920]  uh in the article and watson's changed the headline at my suggestion fox
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:32.360]  news calls for obama to be killed while framing almox jones for
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:36.120]  instigating violence and look i'm not looking to fight with the
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:39.320]  control corporate press when they write two big articles put at the
[02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:43.560]  terrorist section and basically say i'm inciting terrorism and then meanwhile
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:47.960]  they're the ones actually doing it this is just too rich this is just too much
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:52.040]  it's absurdist and we're going to expose it straight ahead but first
[02:04:52.040 --> 02:04:56.120]  the militias then the the frame up of all of the true
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:04:59.000]  conservatives and libertarians in this country you want to know what's going
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:03.000]  to happen we'll tell you hi this is alex jones did you know that the global
[02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.560]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:09.240]  storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[02:05:09.240 --> 02:05:12.360]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:15.640]  it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country
[02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:17.960]  and it's possible that could even happen again
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:21.720]  so our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of
[02:05:21.720 --> 02:05:25.480]  non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:29.160]  and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:32.440]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been

[02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:44.840]  here is the indictment of the hatari militia in michigan looks like there
[02:08:44.840 --> 02:08:49.240]  were only really seven members of this most of them family members
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:55.720]  their brother has been on cnn who lives in san tonio texas south of where i sit
[02:08:55.720 --> 02:08:58.920]  saying look he made a board game about fighting different enemies they did all
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:04.040]  sorts of different scenarios and it's the same thing as when the
[02:09:04.040 --> 02:09:08.440]  military trains with the boy scouts to quote take on disgruntled veterans
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:11.560]  new york times here's that article scouts trained to fight terrorists and more
[02:09:11.560 --> 02:09:16.200]  first line taking out of disgruntled iraq war veteran
[02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:19.800]  that'd be like saying the boy scouts should be charged
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:24.520]  the explorer scouts for trying to kill veterans
[02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:28.280]  and i've seen this over and over again this is how the feds
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:33.240]  have always been able to set people up i've seen it over
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:36.920]  and over and over again in texas in michigan in florida
[02:09:36.920 --> 02:09:44.440]  in alabama in california in nevada in arizona in oregon uh in washington state
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:47.720]  the they have a handbook they give their informants and agents
[02:09:47.720 --> 02:09:51.400]  and they go in and say we ought to do a drill in case the local police get
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:55.960]  taken over by the un we ought to go scout out the police department
[02:09:55.960 --> 02:10:00.040]  and then they go and they take video of it they come back and have a meeting and
[02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:02.920]  the fed generally is the leader of the group by then because he's buying them
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:07.400]  guns and food and you know they love him and it may take him two three years to
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:10.840]  get their trust and boy they just love bubba or whatever
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:12.920]  his name is he's really you know a southern
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:18.520]  primary law center trainee or he's an fbi agent
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:22.040]  and then he says we need to train to look at
[02:10:22.040 --> 02:10:26.840]  how we'd run an ambush like in the movie red dawn
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:31.560]  we act like a cars broke down and when the cop pulls up we kill them right
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:39.640]  bill right jenny right tom i guess so i guess so bubba is that what we do
[02:10:39.640 --> 02:10:45.560]  that's right now let me hear your plan to tell me how you would do that in this
[02:10:45.560 --> 02:10:48.680]  simulation it's just a simulation mind you they're
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:53.400]  recording the whole thing and then one of the younger ones is
[02:10:53.400 --> 02:10:57.080]  yeah and then when the feds come to be part of the funeral
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:03.640]  we'd have ids out there and we'd blow them up oh that's a good idea you sure
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:06.600]  are smart now
[02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:13.160]  i had pale horse on one of the people arrested and and they're saying there's
[02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:16.200]  members in the group now that that's i told you this
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:19.720]  monday i told you again tuesday and then the wall street journal i hadn't read
[02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:23.080]  it till last night came out and said yeah there was an informant
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:27.000]  and someone else in the group who's been arrested but they're gonna let him go
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:31.240]  i told you they always stage it it's like the moon by thing the leader was u.s
[02:11:31.240 --> 02:11:34.200]  intelligence and they're saying well we've got him and we're gonna let probably
[02:11:34.200 --> 02:11:38.040]  let him go or look at him off with some lenience that's only because it came out
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:40.680]  he was a fed
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:45.880]  and looking at these photographs let's look at these photographs
[02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:54.280]  now i've learned i mean this guy obviously dumber in the box of rocks
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:57.960]  the leader his son dumber in the box of rocks i mean
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:01.000]  these people all look like and i'm not trying to be mean like they may be
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:05.160]  missing chromosomes this guy this guy this guy joke
[02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:10.840]  this guy we're gonna get into him later and i'm still doing investigations
[02:12:11.400 --> 02:12:16.360]  thomas william flutek we need to look very closely because if i i've seen
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:20.760]  informants i mean i mean i've had guys that look just like this
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:27.080]  try to set me i mean i mean they look i mean this guy this guy right here
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:32.360]  look he doesn't even look too concerned there these people are all wide eyed
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:36.840]  you can tell they're not too pleased about what's going on
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:40.600]  not in a jail uniform as you notice
[02:12:41.240 --> 02:12:44.920]  they said they had basically a staged arrest of one of their operatives
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:52.920]  inside now we'll see if i'm right about this but i mean i had
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:59.960]  pale horse on sickles in august of 17th going if you're not a fed somebody's
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:03.240]  handling you and telling you to dress like that and use a voice changer
[02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:07.640]  this comes right out of the adl what you're doing
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:11.160]  and he needs to be looked at as well
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:16.040]  and we'll get him up on screen pull sickles up
[02:13:19.160 --> 02:13:24.680]  you talk about a setup so there's an fbi agent there's an informant and
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:28.840]  there's someone inside the group that's working with them as an informant
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:35.240]  they're going to be let go is it the guy not in a jail uniform here
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:44.360]  is it sickles and when he was on the show i played this
[02:13:49.240 --> 02:13:52.360]  i played it what yesterday
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:14:08.280]  or was it monday yesterday yesterday i played the august 17th show
[02:14:12.040 --> 02:14:14.280]  now
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:21.560]  looking at this when he was on the show i said they're
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:26.760]  going to try to get you to drill to case out a police station and they're
[02:14:26.760 --> 02:14:29.720]  going to try to set you up that you're planning to attack police stations
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:34.760]  because they want to get the cops all hating militia or anyone that's into
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:38.600]  the second amendment or tea parties so they always try to get militia
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:41.880]  to target police stations they try to get the black group
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:47.800]  the young christians down in florida do it i mean it's always the same story
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:51.640]  to get the cops all into this paranoid delusional
[02:14:51.640 --> 02:14:54.040]  culture
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:59.160]  and i also told you monday and tuesday that this is always the same they
[02:14:59.160 --> 02:15:05.560]  psychologically profile weak-minded scared groups who are
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:09.240]  weak-minded who can then be tricked into war gaming
[02:15:09.240 --> 02:15:13.640]  who can be tricked into scenarios so the feds can sell it as if it was a real
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:17.080]  attack plan now of course it's coming out it wasn't a real attack plan
[02:15:17.080 --> 02:15:20.200]  but it's like every other case you'll hear about it for a month and then a
[02:15:20.200 --> 02:15:23.720]  month later all the information comes out but it's even coming out within a
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:27.720]  few days this time that it wasn't real it was in their heads
[02:15:27.720 --> 02:15:32.600]  and seen as part of a war gaming scenario
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:37.000]  and at the date they had to go down to city hall was for a protest
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:42.120]  not for a plan to kill police officers but that doesn't matter now
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:46.360]  and this coincides with all of this demonization in the media
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:50.920]  of patriots of conservatives of libertarians of tea parties
[02:15:50.920 --> 02:15:54.200]  as the government's done all these illegal unconstitutional things as
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:16:00.120]  people are getting angry with the government and rightfully so and
[02:16:00.120 --> 02:16:04.280]  politically so they want to now stage more violent attacks
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:08.200]  and more fake arrests to to kind of prep people's minds
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:15.000]  for spectacular attacks mixed in with some smaller attacks in the next few
[02:16:15.000 --> 02:16:19.240]  months as a pretext to fully roll out
[02:16:19.240 --> 02:16:24.600]  homeland security against the american people
[02:16:24.600 --> 02:16:28.520]  here is the sun times undercover agent witness provided intelligence on a
[02:16:28.520 --> 02:16:31.720]  ledge christian militia member and it says it was another militia that
[02:16:31.720 --> 02:16:36.440]  initially reported some of the big militias in
[02:16:36.440 --> 02:16:40.200]  michigan are completely fed ron and then again they go out and
[02:16:40.200 --> 02:16:45.560]  interface and decide run by agents who's good to set up
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:49.640]  an unidentified cooperating witness helped provide intelligence
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:54.600]  to a federal grand jury about at least one of the alleged members of the group
[02:16:54.600 --> 02:17:03.880]  thomas petac who delivers steel drums for a south side company
[02:17:05.080 --> 02:17:09.080]  and this isn't clear whether thomas petac is the one who provided the info
[02:17:09.080 --> 02:17:14.040]  or the info was provided on him the person pictured therein is the
[02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:18.680]  person known as cooperating witness an undercover fb agent to be the
[02:17:18.680 --> 02:17:24.040]  person who participated in the criminal violations contained in the indictment
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:27.880]  a government filing in the case reads referring to photos
[02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:34.120]  of petac shown to the grand jury
[02:17:35.640 --> 02:17:38.520]  and so the way this is written jaren you're the one that just brought this to
[02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:43.960]  me i saw it this morning they're saying there it's petac right
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:49.080]  yeah it's not clear
[02:17:49.080 --> 02:17:57.320]  i wonder again it's either petac or its sickles are the two i identified as i
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:18:01.320]  just said you just brought this in and it's not clear it's vague here but was
[02:18:01.320 --> 02:18:04.840]  it sickles reporting on petac
[02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:08.200]  yeah
[02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:13.160]  the filing was made to correct petac's middle name which it says was
[02:18:13.160 --> 02:18:16.760]  mistakenly entered as edward said of william on his arrest warrant and
[02:18:16.760 --> 02:18:20.920]  indictment
[02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:25.560]  oh man i mean
[02:18:26.680 --> 02:18:33.000]  i was i'm not gonna get into it it's just they're constantly trying to set me up
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:36.440]  when i was in denver for the dnc i constantly had people coming up going
[02:18:36.440 --> 02:18:40.040]  oh alex i'm a big fan do you want some guns when you're out
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:46.280]  demonstrating to be safe i'm like no i i don't want guns
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:49.960]  so they could say alex jones had a concealed gun he was planning to get
[02:18:49.960 --> 02:18:52.760]  obama i mean it would just over and over again
[02:18:52.760 --> 02:18:55.960]  people coming up and being an event or i'd be somewhere and it was always a
[02:18:55.960 --> 02:19:01.400]  cop or informant type hey you want some guns to protect yourself
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:05.400]  it's just and then and then these feds will just run off and just lie about you
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:10.040]  because i have experienced them doing this i have experienced
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:13.560]  you're standing there at a fence to watch the military do a takeover drill
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:18.040]  at a municipal airport and a guy comes out of the bushes and says
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:23.560]  you asked me to light this on fire and i'm like stop it stop
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:27.240]  i mean folks i've been there over and over and over and over again and last
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:29.400]  time i was remembering all the other times it happened
[02:19:29.400 --> 02:19:32.040]  i mean it
[02:19:32.920 --> 02:19:37.800]  and to be on the news alex jones tried to burn down the forest
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:45.240]  to hurt the military he's a domestic terrorist
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:49.560]  and so a lot of these michigans are fed founded and fed run just like the white
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:54.200]  supremacist groups and they're there to try to radicalize and make
[02:19:54.200 --> 02:19:57.320]  militias look stupid and so they can go out and set people up to create the
[02:19:57.320 --> 02:20:01.160]  illusion that there's all these terrorist groups out there
[02:20:01.160 --> 02:20:05.160]  oh my sinuses they feel like they'll explode

[02:36:56.280 --> 02:37:01.800]  moon by terrorist was u.s agent now i saw this this morning
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:07.000]  and then i saw the link to the affidavit where it talks about
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:14.120]  headley who was this son of a u.s diplomat classic spy kids
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:17.800]  um we knew that the so-called shooters
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:22.120]  had pcp lsd at levels that would kill some people in their bodies
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:25.800]  on the videos are just whacked out of their mind classic mind control
[02:37:25.800 --> 02:37:29.640]  we knew the u.s government was jamming signals i mean this came out here's our
[02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:33.640]  articles from over a year ago december 7 2008
[02:37:33.640 --> 02:37:38.040]  arrests provides more evidence india israel and us behind moon by
[02:37:38.040 --> 02:37:41.560]  attacks it goes through the head of of indian
[02:37:41.560 --> 02:37:44.760]  intelligence who was killed that day days before saying these are staged
[02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:46.920]  attacks coming he was there to try to stop it
[02:37:46.920 --> 02:37:49.640]  moon by terrorists were aided by indian authorities
[02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:52.760]  we have links to mainstream news and all these articles media forced to
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:37:57.080]  backtrack on al-qaeda linked to moon by attacks
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:00.360]  moon by attacks blamed on al-qaeda's pretext for u.s military response in
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:04.680]  pakistan so and this came out in major papers in europe
[02:38:04.680 --> 02:38:12.520]  a year and a half ago but now it is a huge firestorm in europe and
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:18.200]  in asia and in the subcontinent because imagine hotel shopping malls people
[02:38:18.200 --> 02:38:20.680]  running around just waving machine guns and
[02:38:20.680 --> 02:38:23.960]  hand grenades killing people flipped out of their minds on
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:29.080]  psychotropic drugs we now go to alex newman to break down these
[02:38:29.080 --> 02:38:32.920]  latest developments thanks for coming on with us
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:37.800]  what's just been going on you know we didn't have you up i apologize well we
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:40.200]  didn't have you up go ahead and start over
[02:38:40.200 --> 02:38:43.960]  oh no problem thanks for having me alex and uh so basically what's going on now
[02:38:43.960 --> 02:38:48.280]  what i was just writing about is that this terrorist was supposed to be a
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:51.000]  terrorist also a quote unquote former government
[02:38:51.000 --> 02:38:54.440]  agent it was just reached a plea deal with the u.s government
[02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:58.360]  which is going to do a lot of things um one of the most important of them is
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:03.080]  that it's going to be keeping all of his links to intelligent agencies american
[02:39:03.080 --> 02:39:06.760]  and pakistani classified so basically we're never really
[02:39:06.760 --> 02:39:10.440]  going to get to find out what happened here or what did happen and same thing
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:13.240]  with the fort hood shooter excuse me go ahead
[02:39:13.240 --> 02:39:17.160]  oh no problem but it it's it's just really ridiculous and and the indians
[02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:20.040]  are furious about it the american press hasn't really given it too much
[02:39:20.040 --> 02:39:23.320]  coverage uh actually almost nothing the new york times had
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:27.480]  one piece by a letter from india or something like that that alluded to
[02:39:27.480 --> 02:39:31.160]  his connection to the cia but i mean this is huge news
[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:34.280]  and and it's really unfortunate that we're not going to get to know what
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:37.080]  happened and just imagine the indians you know
[02:39:37.080 --> 02:39:40.360]  some guys run around murdering hundreds of people
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:43.320]  and suddenly they don't even get to know what happened it could you imagine if
[02:39:43.320 --> 02:39:46.840]  that happened in america if some foreign terrorist came and started
[02:39:46.840 --> 02:39:49.320]  shooting up one of our cities and then one of their
[02:39:49.320 --> 02:39:52.920]  governments was shielding that person well that actually came out two weeks
[02:39:52.920 --> 02:39:57.560]  ago in the associated press aclu got the documents where the 911
[02:39:57.560 --> 02:40:00.920]  commission was ordered not to investigate the attacks by the wine
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:03.960]  house so i mean there's always a cover up here
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:08.600]  and it's always us israelian british intelligence every time running
[02:40:08.600 --> 02:40:12.600]  everything it is it's just such a pattern that every
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:15.800]  time one of these things happen you always have the government trying to hide
[02:40:15.800 --> 02:40:18.920]  things and and i mean if there's nothing to hide why are they
[02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:23.240]  acting so suspicious about it it's just obvious that something strange is going
[02:40:23.240 --> 02:40:25.960]  on here let's talk about this david colman
[02:40:25.960 --> 02:40:30.760]  uh... headley and then this is in the affidavit this is in the news u.s
[02:40:30.760 --> 02:40:35.240]  intelligence agent yeah it started back in the late
[02:40:35.240 --> 02:40:39.800]  nineties he got busted trafficking heroin so the dea convinced him that he
[02:40:39.800 --> 02:40:42.360]  should be a secret agent for them in package that
[02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:45.960]  so he went over there and during the time that he was working for them or
[02:40:45.960 --> 02:40:50.040]  close to it he started training with the terrorist group in pakistan called the
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:53.720]  lax caritaiba which is a well-known pakistani
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:57.720]  intelligence aided organization i mean it's no question they helped found it
[02:40:57.720 --> 02:41:00.920]  they helped operate it and you know prominent indians have been
[02:41:00.920 --> 02:41:03.720]  coming out and saying that the former the top
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:07.320]  counterintelligence chief of the indian security services has said it
[02:41:07.320 --> 02:41:10.760]  uh... the former indian ambassador to pakistan has said it
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:14.840]  is what's going on here is the government was in some capacity involved
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:17.480]  in this and they had to have known about it at the very least
[02:41:17.480 --> 02:41:20.600]  and there's probably more to it than that and with this plea agreement that he
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:23.160]  just got we're never going to get to know unfortunately
[02:41:23.160 --> 02:41:26.920]  so it's just a travesty what's going on here well what we know is he
[02:41:26.920 --> 02:41:32.840]  he admits to running the key gps operations being being in a leadership
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:37.640]  position and then everybody else gets killed and their bodies are full of
[02:41:37.640 --> 02:41:42.520]  pcp lsd i mean we don't even know if this is supposedly the people they
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:45.400]  could have had just some nuts separately
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:48.840]  who were hallucinating and then black ops
[02:41:48.840 --> 02:41:51.960]  shoot some of the people that's what witnesses said they were seeing
[02:41:51.960 --> 02:41:55.000]  uh... the former head well at the time the head of counter
[02:41:55.000 --> 02:41:58.600]  of anti-terror forces he gets killed in the attacks
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:02.680]  he was coming out saying that western intelligence had infiltrated
[02:42:02.680 --> 02:42:05.640]  and was going to stage this attack he was there to try to stop it
[02:42:05.640 --> 02:42:10.680]  he got killed a replay of john o'neill back on nine eleven the fbi head of
[02:42:10.680 --> 02:42:15.240]  counterterrorism being killed and so this just goes on and on and on
[02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:21.400]  but the motives here are certain factions in pakistan that want the us to
[02:42:21.400 --> 02:42:24.280]  come in stage an attack against india
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:28.200]  as a pretext for us forces to be brought into pakistan
[02:42:28.200 --> 02:42:33.080]  yeah and you know like you said he really was crucial to this operation
[02:42:33.080 --> 02:42:37.000]  he like you said he gathered gps coordinates for the team to land there
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.400]  he was conducting surveillance and he was key to this entire operation and so
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:43.640]  now it comes out that he's a government agent and
[02:42:43.640 --> 02:42:47.720]  everything's going to be classified so something incredibly suspicious is
[02:42:47.720 --> 02:42:50.840]  going on and the people really need to start asking the government what is
[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:53.640]  going on here i mean indians who are just
[02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:58.440]  outraged that this could happen well let's go over
[02:42:58.440 --> 02:43:01.560]  more of this guy's past and what type of government agent
[02:43:01.560 --> 02:43:07.560]  uh... he was and uh... now they're talking about basically
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:10.760]  you're giving him a lower sentence or something and
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:13.880]  that they're protecting him under national security
[02:43:13.880 --> 02:43:17.720]  yeah well in his plea agreement i mean for this crime obviously he he could
[02:43:17.720 --> 02:43:21.160]  have gotten the death sentence and with this plea agreement he might not even
[02:43:21.160 --> 02:43:25.320]  serve a life sentence in prison so i mean this is clearly some kind of cover
[02:43:25.320 --> 02:43:29.320]  up some kind of protection going on for this guy and the us is actually bound
[02:43:29.320 --> 02:43:33.000]  by treaty to hand him over to indian authority so we're actually not
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:36.920]  fulfilling our obligations in order to cover up the trail of this guy
[02:43:36.920 --> 02:43:40.040]  and so some people have been saying that you know maybe they just made a huge
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:43.160]  mistake and their agent went totally rogue and out of control
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:46.680]  and now they're trying to cover that up but the thing is we're not ever going
[02:43:46.680 --> 02:43:49.240]  to know because they're it's all classified now
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:53.480]  so you know it would seem like if it was just an innocent mistake
[02:43:53.480 --> 02:43:56.760]  there wouldn't be this the whole brujaja trying to cover it up it would seem
[02:43:56.760 --> 02:44:00.120]  that they would just admit they made a mistake everybody makes mistakes from
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:03.480]  time to time and you know just come clean but that's not what
[02:44:03.480 --> 02:44:07.640]  that's not what we're seeing at all unfortunately and it's the same in
[02:44:07.640 --> 02:44:12.040]  every single case i wish the terrorism was just small
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:15.560]  lone groups that's a lot less scary than knowing the people running our
[02:44:15.560 --> 02:44:19.240]  government are manufacturing these attacks to start wars
[02:44:19.240 --> 02:44:24.760]  and take our freedoms yeah for sure
[02:44:24.760 --> 02:44:28.680]  we'll continue going over some of the other important facets of your detailed
[02:44:28.680 --> 02:44:34.520]  article okay um well we have uh here the
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:39.480]  ambassador who served in pakistan uh his name is mk
[02:44:39.480 --> 02:44:44.200]  bhadrakumar and he points out that the l et is closely affiliated with the
[02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:48.120]  pakistan inter-services intelligence their equivalent of the cia
[02:44:48.120 --> 02:44:52.120]  and it's basically impossible that this operation would have gone on
[02:44:52.120 --> 02:44:55.880]  without the knowledge of the pakistani government and the connections between
[02:44:55.880 --> 02:44:59.720]  the cia and the isi the pakistan version of the cia
[02:44:59.720 --> 02:45:03.080]  are well known they've been working with each other for a long time funding
[02:45:03.080 --> 02:45:06.920]  each other helping out with cross intelligence and so
[02:45:06.920 --> 02:45:09.880]  if the pakistani government knew that this was going on it's almost
[02:45:09.880 --> 02:45:13.000]  inconceivable that the u.s government would have wouldn't have known what was
[02:45:13.000 --> 02:45:15.720]  going on and well obviously they didn't tell the
[02:45:15.720 --> 02:45:19.320]  indians that this was happening and on top of that there's there's been a few
[02:45:19.320 --> 02:45:23.480]  cia moles who have been caught within the indian security services
[02:45:23.480 --> 02:45:27.560]  and so that's leading people to a lot of indian journalists have been accusing
[02:45:27.560 --> 02:45:30.360]  certain indian officials of being involved in this as well
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:34.600]  so whether they're rogue indian agents or whether they're collaborating with
[02:45:34.600 --> 02:45:37.080]  other governments whether it be pakistan or the american
[02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:40.760]  governments we don't know but there's there's clearly a lot going on here
[02:45:40.760 --> 02:45:45.560]  that isn't being talked about and that needs to be investigated
[02:45:45.560 --> 02:45:50.280]  well right after this happened we were able to get hameed gul
[02:45:50.280 --> 02:45:54.600]  on the radio show the former head of pakistani intelligence
[02:45:54.600 --> 02:45:58.360]  and he said that this was purely a u.s israeli
[02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:04.120]  indian operation as a pretext to start invasions and drone attacks and that did
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:08.680]  then indeed happen so that might be a good radio interview for
[02:46:08.680 --> 02:46:11.320]  you to pull up and listen to for further research
[02:46:11.320 --> 02:46:15.000]  yeah absolutely i appreciate that ali and yeah and a lot of indian journalists
[02:46:15.000 --> 02:46:18.600]  have been saying that this was aided and abetted by the indian
[02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:21.720]  intelligence services to come have accused the israeli intelligence
[02:46:21.720 --> 02:46:24.600]  services as well as involvement and pakistan
[02:46:24.600 --> 02:46:27.800]  fingerprints is is pretty much undeniable at this point he was training
[02:46:27.800 --> 02:46:31.480]  with the l.e.t. it's well known it's admitted and the l.e.t. is
[02:46:31.480 --> 02:46:34.440]  essentially a terrorist group that's run by the pakistani government
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:37.400]  with of course all of its links to the american government
[02:46:37.400 --> 02:46:42.680]  so and then all these governments use these attacks as pretext to clamp down
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:45.960]  on their own populations yeah steal money steal freedom
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:48.680]  it's all the terrorists are going to get you if you don't give up your right
[02:46:48.680 --> 02:46:52.680]  and give up your money and and then what do we get more terrorism i mean it
[02:46:52.680 --> 02:46:56.840]  can't be incompetent this guy who got on the airplane the underwear bomber
[02:46:56.840 --> 02:47:00.600]  obviously he had held from some well-dressed man how how did he get on
[02:47:00.600 --> 02:47:03.320]  an airplane with a passport without a passport and then the state department
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:05.960]  admits after a month and a half of denying it okay
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:10.360]  a u.s intelligence agency unnamed told us to help him get on the plane and give
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:16.680]  him a visa yep yep and it's the same story and it says it now with these
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:19.720]  militias they had informants in there running the
[02:47:19.720 --> 02:47:23.560]  whole thing yep radicalizing people getting them to
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:26.680]  say stupid things accidentally things that they don't mean
[02:47:26.680 --> 02:47:30.760]  and yet then going in arresting them and playing the sound bites on the afternoon
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:33.400]  media so that everybody knows that they need to give up their rights and their
[02:47:33.400 --> 02:47:37.880]  freedom is it's just pathetic
[02:47:37.880 --> 02:47:42.920]  well why did the john birch society write on this i mean i mean i like the jbs
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:47.560]  but i found it's i don't want to say timid but very very
[02:47:47.560 --> 02:47:51.320]  careful uh i mean even when there was evidence of
[02:47:51.320 --> 02:47:54.680]  oklahoma city being an inside job for a long time then they did some seminal
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:58.840]  research on it uh they didn't for a long time report on the inconsistencies of
[02:47:58.840 --> 02:48:01.640]  9 11 uh because i guess they didn't want to have
[02:48:01.640 --> 02:48:06.360]  people discredit them but uh it it it it does seem that the jbs is really
[02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:09.240]  getting a lot more hardcore now we had mcmanus in
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:12.920]  last year and he said that you know there might have been some you know
[02:48:12.920 --> 02:48:15.880]  some operatives inside trying to suppress what you guys were doing but
[02:48:15.880 --> 02:48:19.320]  that the jbs is going in the right direction now
[02:48:19.320 --> 02:48:23.320]  no the jbs is a great organization and you know they always are really careful
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:26.360]  with what they publish they always want to make sure the facts are a hundred
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:29.800]  percent accurate before going forward with anything and so i respect that i
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:33.080]  received the tip on this from dennis bernhardt who's the
[02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:38.120]  editor of the jbs website and you know when there's when something can be
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:41.960]  verified backed up it then you know they go for it and so
[02:48:41.960 --> 02:48:45.720]  i think the jbs is is really a great organization in terms of
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:49.960]  helping to educate americans not just on the principles but also you know the
[02:48:49.960 --> 02:48:52.920]  the news of what's going on the new american magazine too
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:57.000]  part of the jbs and i think they really do a a great job of trying to get to the
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:00.600]  truth and publishing accurate information you know
[02:49:00.600 --> 02:49:05.400]  oh i do as well it's just that i've i've seen them get more aggressive
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:08.760]  because i've seen times when the evidence is there and they still don't go
[02:49:08.760 --> 02:49:13.080]  there because they're being careful but you know but now i'm seeing them you
[02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:17.000]  know really really come into the 21st century which is great because
[02:49:17.000 --> 02:49:21.320]  so much of us and so many of us out there woke up and are informed
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:25.880]  because of you know the work of the john birch society over the last 50 years
[02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:30.040]  and you know the media they really love to jump on every little thing so you
[02:49:30.040 --> 02:49:32.920]  the new american magazine and the john birch society they
[02:49:32.920 --> 02:49:37.240]  i think they're really cautious in in what they say and make sure 100 percent
[02:49:37.240 --> 02:49:40.520]  for sure that it's accurate and truthful before going forward with it
[02:49:40.520 --> 02:49:43.720]  because as with any effective organization promoting freedom and so
[02:49:43.720 --> 02:49:47.080]  forth the media will immediately seize and pounce on
[02:49:47.080 --> 02:49:51.480]  any minor inaccuracy and try to discredit everything and you know that's
[02:49:51.480 --> 02:49:55.320]  certainly not something that they would want so i think they use a good
[02:49:55.320 --> 02:49:58.760]  strategy and i'm really happy to be working with them and helping to educate
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:00.840]  america
[02:50:00.840 --> 02:50:05.160]  well absolutely there were two big fox news articles yesterday in the terror
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:09.720]  section basically saying that i'm a radical calling for violence and that
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:13.640]  there are people on my website and they implied it was articles calling for
[02:50:13.640 --> 02:50:17.400]  violence when it was comments we then went to fox news and found their
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:20.280]  pundits and their contributors calling for violence
[02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:24.120]  and their commenters calling for it so the headline is fox news calls for
[02:50:24.120 --> 02:50:28.440]  obama to be killed while framing alex jones for instigating violence
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:31.960]  i mean this is getting really creepy to have the southern property law center
[02:50:31.960 --> 02:50:37.480]  adl time magazine newsweek uh george soros publications
[02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:41.880]  neocon publications all coming out against me
[02:50:41.880 --> 02:50:45.880]  because we are really exposing these creatures for what they are and it means
[02:50:45.880 --> 02:50:52.040]  the issues we're covering here are like holy water and crosses to vampires
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:56.200]  and that's why people need to really get the word out about info wars dot com

[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:31.000]  in fact i had that times of london headline that was similar saying you know
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:33.880]  these informants are and these stings are
[02:55:33.880 --> 02:55:38.360]  maybe illegal but they want the illusion there are these terrorists
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:42.360]  everywhere but then meanwhile when you've got the
[02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:45.720]  illegal aliens killing cops killing ranchers burning their houses down from
[02:55:45.720 --> 02:55:49.800]  texas to california lawmakers demand administration
[02:55:49.800 --> 02:55:53.720]  deploy national guard border patrol after killing
[02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:56.520]  lawmakers from arizona new mexico are ratcheting up and demands the obama
[02:55:56.520 --> 02:55:59.400]  administration deploy hundreds of national guard troops at border
[02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:02.440]  patrol agents at the mexican border after the killing of a prominent
[02:56:02.440 --> 02:56:06.760]  southeast arizona rancher he had helped the legal aliens that were dying in the
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:09.000]  desert but he'd also criticize the open border
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:13.480]  well he's been murdered now that's how the government down there does things
[02:56:13.480 --> 02:56:18.360]  going back in closing to alex newman i'm glad you're reporting on this in the
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:21.880]  u.s this is a big story and i know you're on it
[02:56:21.880 --> 02:56:27.720]  other points you'd like to add about all this evidence of terrorism being staged
[02:56:27.720 --> 02:56:30.920]  yeah well i mean it what it really goes to show is that
[02:56:30.920 --> 02:56:35.320]  this war on terror is really a scam i mean if if they need to go around
[02:56:35.320 --> 02:56:38.360]  radicalizing people getting people to say stupid things
[02:56:38.360 --> 02:56:41.800]  using their agents to work in terror camps
[02:56:41.800 --> 02:56:45.240]  it what it shows you is that really a lot of this stuff wouldn't be happening
[02:56:45.240 --> 02:56:49.640]  without the government involvement so it it it really is a scam to take our
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:52.760]  freedom and take our money sure they they probably convinced some
[02:56:52.760 --> 02:56:55.960]  dupes from time to time that you know they're going to go meet alex they go
[02:56:55.960 --> 02:56:58.760]  blow themselves up i'm sure there's plenty of people that are
[02:56:58.760 --> 02:57:02.120]  they actually believe what they're doing is you know for whatever cause they
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:05.720]  think they're working for but all all these government fingerprints all over
[02:57:05.720 --> 02:57:08.120]  everything what it shows is that it's a scam and
[02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:11.640]  that this stuff wouldn't be happening if it wasn't for them
[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:16.120]  so i mean the american people really need to start waking up
[02:57:16.120 --> 02:57:19.560]  your listeners i really hope they go out and talk to all their friends and their
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:22.040]  family and you know tell people to just go on the
[02:57:22.040 --> 02:57:25.320]  internet start googling stuff find the article find the information it's out
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:27.640]  there a lot of it's even reported from time to
[02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:30.680]  time in the mainstream press it just they don't
[02:57:30.680 --> 02:57:34.120]  highlight it and show the importance of it as it needs to be
[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:38.120]  so i i just hope that people will start waking up and start holding the
[02:57:38.120 --> 02:57:41.000]  government accountable so that they stop this stuff you know if the u.s
[02:57:41.000 --> 02:57:43.480]  government would be obeying the constitution we wouldn't have these
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:47.080]  problems if they would stop meddling in foreign countries if they would stop
[02:57:47.080 --> 02:57:51.080]  hiring terrorists and double agents triple agents and doing all kinds of
[02:57:51.080 --> 02:57:54.360]  things that the american government really has no business doing the
[02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:57.160]  americans would be a lot safer we'd be a lot richer
[02:57:57.160 --> 02:58:01.400]  and we wouldn't have to be giving up all the rights for this stuff so i just i
[02:58:01.400 --> 02:58:04.680]  really appreciate the work you're doing alex and and you know i really want

[03:00:22.840 --> 03:00:26.760]  because i just constantly see confirmed news articles where they just frame
[03:00:26.760 --> 03:00:30.760]  anybody and everybody and shut people up and it's creeping me out
[03:00:30.760 --> 03:00:34.360]  uh because we've got the southern primary law center adl
[03:00:34.360 --> 03:00:40.360]  fox news now uh writing articles saying i'm calling for violence and i'm evil
[03:00:40.360 --> 03:00:44.840]  and i'm not all we've ever talked about is not having violence
[03:00:44.840 --> 03:00:50.920]  and i've had people showing up at events saying hey let's kill cops and
[03:00:50.920 --> 03:00:56.760]  i've been covering military drills and and and and had people just pop out of
[03:00:56.760 --> 03:01:00.360]  the bushes and start setting fire to things trying to say i did it i mean
[03:01:00.360 --> 03:01:03.400]  i've i've had them try to set me up over and over again
[03:01:03.400 --> 03:01:06.920]  military intelligence that came out in the news what last year that ron paul and
[03:01:06.920 --> 03:01:09.560]  myself are surveilled by the pentagon illegally
[03:01:09.560 --> 03:01:14.280]  that was even in the boltamore sun and i'm a syndicated radio host i'm a
[03:01:14.280 --> 03:01:19.880]  constitutionalist i'm a libertarian and there's an article every day in the
[03:01:19.880 --> 03:01:23.800]  new york times london guardian fox news i mean
[03:01:23.800 --> 03:01:27.320]  there's an article every day saying i'm violent
[03:01:27.320 --> 03:01:34.440]  and that i want terrorism and so that's not the a few weeks ago when i wanted to
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:37.560]  get dr frederick weihurst on that that wasn't my main reason for getting him
[03:01:37.560 --> 03:01:41.240]  on but i wanted to ask him his advice as a whistleblower and somebody they
[03:01:41.240 --> 03:01:44.600]  tried to persecute uh we're going to break here in a moment but we're going to
[03:01:44.600 --> 03:01:51.160]  go to him um right now here dr frederick
[03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:55.080]  weihurst america's first successful fbi whistleblower
[03:01:55.080 --> 03:01:59.800]  forced to um the president to an executive order
[03:01:59.800 --> 03:02:04.360]  ensuring whistleblower protection of all fbi agents who expose misconduct
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:08.760]  his case exposed forensic fraud in the fbi crime lab and suggested it to
[03:02:08.760 --> 03:02:13.240]  outside oversight for the first time and i interviewed him many many years ago
[03:02:13.240 --> 03:02:16.600]  but it's good to have him here with us today he's the director of the forensic
[03:02:16.600 --> 03:02:20.760]  justice project and pioneer whistleblower dr weihurst

[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:32.600]  and then all the other cases of major police departments i know you've seen
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:35.720]  the stories houston police department dalis police department just where i
[03:02:35.720 --> 03:02:40.520]  live in texas caught just framing people in an industrial scale
[03:02:40.520 --> 03:02:45.400]  uh and whether the culture is getting more corrupt or if there's been any
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:49.400]  uh good things that have happened and then i want to you know ask you
[03:02:49.400 --> 03:02:54.360]  your advice because i myself literally have provocateurs now jumping out at
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:57.960]  grocery stores asking me if i want to kill people and
[03:02:57.960 --> 03:03:01.080]  you know my my employees will go to a bar to have a drink
[03:03:01.080 --> 03:03:05.080]  and uh everywhere they go people walk up and say hey
[03:03:05.080 --> 03:03:09.080]  i like alex jones what do you think of obama and so i want to get your take
[03:03:09.080 --> 03:03:13.720]  on what you think i had to do i mean i guess just consulting for me here live
[03:03:13.720 --> 03:03:19.160]  on air with any ideas you've got okay uh but we're going to break in a moment
[03:03:19.160 --> 03:03:25.400]  but but tell us about your current activities and your your forensic
[03:03:25.400 --> 03:03:28.840]  justice project well when uh when i was at the
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:34.920]  fb i and we know we were trying to to um
[03:03:34.920 --> 03:03:37.960]  bring to the attention of the department of justice there were issues in the
[03:03:37.960 --> 03:03:42.120]  crime lab we realized first of all we needed to stop it then we needed to
[03:03:42.120 --> 03:03:45.400]  fix it then we needed to find out who got hurt
[03:03:45.400 --> 03:03:51.560]  and finding out who got hurt um is a big part of the picture that in our country
[03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:56.520]  we seem to want to ignore that means there could be tens of thousands of
[03:03:56.520 --> 03:04:01.960]  incarcerated individuals who were uh i don't know whether the word is framed
[03:04:01.960 --> 03:04:05.880]  but were accused by faulty science by faulty crime lab work
[03:04:05.880 --> 03:04:10.840]  product those people need to know they need to know
[03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:14.120]  the department of justice has gone about this by saying well let's ask the
[03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:18.440]  prosecutors if it was material whatever and i don't think that's the proper way
[03:04:18.440 --> 03:04:22.280]  i think if you've been treated miss fairly by your government you are part of
[03:04:22.280 --> 03:04:25.960]  that government and you should be given the courtesy of somebody coming to you
[03:04:25.960 --> 03:04:30.200]  and saying uh by the way this stuff was flawed if you wish to
[03:04:30.200 --> 03:04:33.480]  proceed with it you know here's the way to do it
[03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:36.760]  all right stay there doctor that was a brief segment we're gonna come right

[03:08:41.880 --> 03:08:47.320]  in u.s history perhaps the most famous in the more modern times
[03:08:47.320 --> 03:08:51.400]  he's america's first successful fbi whistleblower dr whitehurst forced the
[03:08:51.400 --> 03:08:54.760]  president to issue an executive order
[03:08:54.760 --> 03:08:59.000]  ensuring whistleblower protection of all fbi agents who exposed misconduct
[03:08:59.000 --> 03:09:02.440]  his case exposed forensic fraud in the fbi crime lab
[03:09:02.440 --> 03:09:06.440]  and subjected to outside oversight for the first time he's the director of the
[03:09:06.440 --> 03:09:10.840]  forensic justice project and pioneer whistleblower dr whitehurst
[03:09:10.840 --> 03:09:15.400]  now joins us and exposes fbi misconduct and forensic fraud
[03:09:15.400 --> 03:09:18.840]  and all over the country every major police department in texas
[03:09:18.840 --> 03:09:22.840]  austin dallas houston san Antonio have all been caught just
[03:09:22.840 --> 03:09:27.160]  framing people in mass it's all over the newspaper san francisco a few weeks
[03:09:27.160 --> 03:09:30.280]  ago i saw in the news truly a texas literally
[03:09:30.280 --> 03:09:35.400]  filling the jail with half the town's black people framing them
[03:09:35.400 --> 03:09:38.840]  here's a new york times article dna evidence can be fabricated scientist
[03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:43.800]  show that was from a week ago folks we knew this
[03:09:43.800 --> 03:09:48.040]  we knew this years ago that they can fake your fingerprints but but i'm going
[03:09:48.040 --> 03:09:51.800]  to shut up now and go to uh... doctor
[03:09:51.800 --> 03:09:54.600]  frederick whitehurst for the balance of the hour to talk about
[03:09:54.600 --> 03:09:56.840]  are things getting worse are they getting better
[03:09:56.840 --> 03:10:01.000]  uh... what's happening around the country uh... but but uh... first sir
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:04.120]  well i'm just going right back to you i've got so many questions just start
[03:10:04.120 --> 03:10:07.960]  wherever you wish well you were talking about um
[03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:10.760]  are things getting worse are getting better and i think they're getting a lot
[03:10:10.760 --> 03:10:13.880]  better i think because we have instantaneous
[03:10:13.880 --> 03:10:17.240]  knowledge now we're connected through the internet there's nothing anybody
[03:10:17.240 --> 03:10:21.560]  can do about it and we can we can research on our own
[03:10:21.560 --> 03:10:25.560]  from our living rooms our bedrooms our offices even our cars we can be at the
[03:10:25.560 --> 03:10:29.400]  beach and find out that for instance an article just came out while i was
[03:10:29.400 --> 03:10:32.840]  waiting for this uh... this show here the Nebraska
[03:10:32.840 --> 03:10:38.200]  csi chief has been found guilty of um planting evidence
[03:10:38.200 --> 03:10:42.440]  we know about those things now and and and that's really healthy
[03:10:42.440 --> 03:10:46.600]  when the government controls the knowledge base then that becomes dangerous
[03:10:46.600 --> 03:10:50.280]  because their inferences may not be proper inferences
[03:10:50.280 --> 03:10:54.360]  we as a people govern this nation that's what
[03:10:54.360 --> 03:10:57.960]  that's what our goal is it may at times we vary from it
[03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:01.960]  but sir i think that with instantaneous knowledge then
[03:11:01.960 --> 03:11:05.560]  we're we all can take part in
[03:11:05.560 --> 03:11:09.240]  juries we can all take part in who we elect
[03:11:09.240 --> 03:11:13.320]  we can say i'm not sure about this we were about two weeks ago three weeks ago
[03:11:13.320 --> 03:11:16.760]  had a guy in north carolina before the north carolina innocence
[03:11:16.760 --> 03:11:20.680]  commission his name dwayne deaver told him
[03:11:20.680 --> 03:11:25.000]  18 years ago during trial of this man it was before the commission
[03:11:25.000 --> 03:11:28.600]  there were two tests that decided whether it was blood in the evidence
[03:11:28.600 --> 03:11:32.120]  and um one of them said yes and the other one said no
[03:11:32.120 --> 03:11:38.040]  and he only reported the yes and it has shaken up this state to think that
[03:11:38.040 --> 03:11:42.600]  a man in our crime laboratory a low league state employee
[03:11:42.600 --> 03:11:47.640]  can put a guy in jail forever be just unilaterally decide well i'm not going
[03:11:47.640 --> 03:11:51.640]  to report the stuff that would hurt the prosecutor day
[03:11:51.640 --> 03:11:55.640]  we found that out instantaneously this wasn't in some court 500 miles from
[03:11:55.640 --> 03:11:58.440]  your whatever it's all over the news all over the place
[03:11:58.440 --> 03:12:01.400]  and so i think it's really things are getting better
[03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:06.760]  a lot better because um you know i could talk to you and you're going out to a
[03:12:06.760 --> 03:12:09.480]  lot of audience i'm in north carolina i think you're in
[03:12:09.480 --> 03:12:15.320]  texas aren't you sir absolutely so um people's questions
[03:12:15.320 --> 03:12:19.640]  can be answered just by going to google and uh are we getting better we're
[03:12:19.640 --> 03:12:23.160]  getting better at the lightning speed at my opinion
[03:12:23.160 --> 03:12:28.040]  some of it's frightening because the paradigms that have been in place for so
[03:12:28.040 --> 03:12:32.280]  long you know let's trust j edger hoover's agents
[03:12:32.280 --> 03:12:36.200]  they're beyond investigation they used to tell me on us in the fbi we're the
[03:12:36.200 --> 03:12:40.120]  investigators nobody'll investigate us well by golly
[03:12:40.120 --> 03:12:44.280]  all of us anybody grade school kid can investigate
[03:12:44.280 --> 03:12:48.280]  any of these things and look at don't just accept
[03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:52.200]  uh so are we are we moving ahead excuse me
[03:12:52.200 --> 03:12:57.000]  we're moving really fast ahead are we scared by what we're seeing right now
[03:12:57.000 --> 03:13:01.480]  yeah but in the in the in the long run it's going to be
[03:13:01.480 --> 03:13:07.240]  healthy well here's an example i have the indictment
[03:13:07.240 --> 03:13:12.360]  and the affidavits for the head of the moon by terror attacks and it's a us
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:17.560]  government agent i have nbc here with the fbi
[03:13:17.560 --> 03:13:21.080]  literally commanding and setting up and running
[03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:25.160]  uh the latest muslim terror group that was going to bomb a synagogue
[03:13:25.160 --> 03:13:28.760]  uh we have uh these groups infiltrating militias
[03:13:28.760 --> 03:13:32.280]  and the leaders are the ones who are government informants or agents
[03:13:32.280 --> 03:13:38.040]  provocaturing this and it's just case after case after case and then
[03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:43.240]  i myself have had people who it turned out were feds
[03:13:43.240 --> 03:13:47.400]  try to set me up for things and so it i'm trying to understand from your
[03:13:47.400 --> 03:13:52.600]  perspective as the former head of the fbi uh crime lab forensics division
[03:13:52.600 --> 03:13:56.120]  how did you awaken how did you start seeing the corruption
[03:13:56.120 --> 03:14:00.040]  why did you speak up what percentage as a dead reckoning
[03:14:00.040 --> 03:14:05.640]  guesstimation of police departments or fbi agents
[03:14:05.640 --> 03:14:10.520]  or their workers what percentage
[03:14:10.520 --> 03:14:14.200]  for whatever reason just love framing people because
[03:14:14.200 --> 03:14:17.480]  we now know because of dna evidence and other issues in some states
[03:14:17.480 --> 03:14:20.840]  a third of the people are more are completely innocent
[03:14:20.840 --> 03:14:24.120]  and we know that the biggest industry now in this nation is prisons
[03:14:24.120 --> 03:14:27.880]  and there's this incentive to just build build build and put more people in
[03:14:27.880 --> 03:14:30.840]  prison and as you said the paradigm is shifting
[03:14:30.840 --> 03:14:35.640]  as the population begins to discover that something is rotten in the state
[03:14:35.640 --> 03:14:40.680]  of our republic well you know if i'd respond to that first of all i i don't
[03:14:40.680 --> 03:14:44.200]  personally believe that most law enforcement officers are bad uh
[03:14:44.200 --> 03:14:48.280]  i'm a very strong supporter of law enforcement and i said serve law
[03:14:48.280 --> 03:14:51.880]  enforcement i didn't i don't support law enforcement
[03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:56.200]  officers that go outside that cross the thin blue line and tarnish their
[03:14:56.200 --> 03:15:00.120]  badge i just don't i understand from being inside
[03:15:00.120 --> 03:15:04.360]  what the pressures are when we have an oklahoma city go up
[03:15:04.360 --> 03:15:07.560]  and we see bodies of little children being dragged out
[03:15:07.560 --> 03:15:12.760]  we call for revenge they call for revenge directs our politicians
[03:15:12.760 --> 03:15:17.240]  that's what they are their politicians do to move forward with an agenda that we
[03:15:17.240 --> 03:15:22.600]  will at all costs da da da da well that vengeance
[03:15:22.600 --> 03:15:27.400]  um drags at the foundation of our justice system
[03:15:27.400 --> 03:15:32.760]  we want to know what happened we want to know who really did it
[03:15:32.760 --> 03:15:37.080]  unfortunately in any enterprise such as law enforcement
[03:15:37.080 --> 03:15:41.400]  where somebody who gives the right answer to the right question at the
[03:15:41.400 --> 03:15:44.680]  right time gets the right job and there's no oversight
[03:15:44.680 --> 03:15:47.960]  um as a as a friend of mine and i were saying
[03:15:47.960 --> 03:15:51.640]  recently we all know what floats to the top in a septic tank
[03:15:51.640 --> 03:15:56.600]  and that frankly is what without proper oversight can float to the top
[03:15:56.600 --> 03:16:00.680]  in the in a in a law enforcement agency or a government agency
[03:16:00.680 --> 03:16:04.680]  people that are willing to do whatever it takes without any moral compass
[03:16:04.680 --> 03:16:09.320]  go to the top they control who then floats to the top with them
[03:16:09.320 --> 03:16:13.320]  the problem you have in law enforcement is the kind of in my opinion
[03:16:13.320 --> 03:16:17.240]  let's take the fbi the fbi is cram packed full of very
[03:16:17.240 --> 03:16:22.600]  very good people and those that remain as law enforcement officers instead of
[03:16:22.600 --> 03:16:26.840]  managers and rear echelon folks those people
[03:16:26.840 --> 03:16:30.920]  they see what's going on and they will respond
[03:16:30.920 --> 03:16:36.040]  they respond either as as you know going to the media under the table which i
[03:16:36.040 --> 03:16:41.480]  think that inappropriate they respond by going forward through the system
[03:16:41.480 --> 03:16:44.040]  for for your listeners that don't know right now
[03:16:44.040 --> 03:16:47.880]  there is a move to gut the whistleblower protection act
[03:16:47.880 --> 03:16:53.400]  at um with a bill it's the senate bill 372 is for the senate right now
[03:16:53.400 --> 03:16:57.640]  to gut the whistleblower protection act to allow the fbi to
[03:16:57.640 --> 03:17:02.280]  to review its own whistleblowers and to decide on their credibility and
[03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:07.640]  totally take their rights away that bill that the the
[03:17:07.640 --> 03:17:11.800]  structure of that bill which came through the white house by the way
[03:17:11.800 --> 03:17:15.240]  a white house which when it was running for elections said
[03:17:15.240 --> 03:17:18.280]  we're going to strengthen whistleblower protection
[03:17:18.280 --> 03:17:23.160]  that bill would put the fbi in a totally
[03:17:23.160 --> 03:17:29.240]  an uncontrolled situation their own law enforcement officers who would do
[03:17:29.240 --> 03:17:33.320]  something about those issues would be shot down the fbi would be allowed
[03:17:33.320 --> 03:17:36.360]  well let's go back and then that would generate even more tyranny
[03:17:36.360 --> 03:17:41.240]  Kathleen Rowley and it was 15 or more other fbi agents
[03:17:41.240 --> 03:17:45.400]  tried to stop the exact you know uh hijackers
[03:17:45.400 --> 03:17:49.240]  and were ordered you will not do that and the guys that blocked them their
[03:17:49.240 --> 03:17:54.120]  superiors they got record cash bonuses and the good fbi agents got demoted or
[03:17:54.120 --> 03:17:58.840]  run out and you know that sir because fbi agents
[03:17:58.840 --> 03:18:03.160]  who they tried to stop came out because they're that kind of people
[03:18:03.160 --> 03:18:06.760]  you know i knew dog on well i might catch a bullet when i was in the fbi for
[03:18:06.760 --> 03:18:10.440]  this stuff i was saying it was it was terrifying for me and
[03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:13.880]  my family and where would the bullet have come from i don't know but
[03:18:13.880 --> 03:18:16.680]  every one of those people said i'll take a bullet
[03:18:16.680 --> 03:18:19.960]  i'll lose my career i'll lose my life's work
[03:18:19.960 --> 03:18:24.200]  i may be put in a nut house i may be arrested i may be whatever
[03:18:24.200 --> 03:18:28.600]  but that's not happening from field agents that's not happening from fbi
[03:18:28.600 --> 03:18:32.840]  agents it's happening from criminals who are loose in the fbi
[03:18:32.840 --> 03:18:37.240]  and that is not the major percentage of them but i could in my experience sir
[03:18:37.240 --> 03:18:41.480]  most of those are top managers at the fbi that have managed
[03:18:41.480 --> 03:18:45.560]  through lack of a moral compass to move to the top
[03:18:45.560 --> 03:18:50.200]  and spread that kind of uh of criminal activity where they want to
[03:18:50.200 --> 03:18:54.440]  but they get stopped if senate bill 372 goes through
[03:18:54.440 --> 03:18:59.560]  there's the fbi agents i guarantee you they'll find another way to stop that
[03:18:59.560 --> 03:19:03.400]  criminal activity they just will if they if they're not allowed to be protected
[03:19:03.400 --> 03:19:06.600]  as whistleblowers then they'll just fall on their swords
[03:19:06.600 --> 03:19:10.600]  they're that kind of people so when you say you know law enforcement's
[03:19:10.600 --> 03:19:13.880]  run amok i think what's happening is because of the
[03:19:13.880 --> 03:19:18.120]  information uh that we can get to now when somebody
[03:19:18.120 --> 03:19:22.040]  does run amok truly a texas for instance we've ever heard of that
[03:19:22.040 --> 03:19:24.920]  you know i lived in texas one time but i never heard of that place
[03:19:24.920 --> 03:19:29.240]  until by golly it was shown up that half the town had been put in jail by a
[03:19:29.240 --> 03:19:33.240]  bunch of crooked cops that kind of information makes us think
[03:19:33.240 --> 03:19:37.480]  twice when we as jurors for his voters go to the poll
[03:19:37.480 --> 03:19:42.200]  i mean it it just does amazing stay there i want to get into
[03:19:42.200 --> 03:19:45.960]  in a nutshell your story sir so people can understand what you went through
[03:19:45.960 --> 03:19:49.240]  and then talk about some of the successes that you've seen but also some
[03:19:49.240 --> 03:19:53.240]  of the defeats and what this does to the whole criminal justice system
[03:19:53.240 --> 03:19:57.240]  as we have this loss of innocence and we all discover together
[03:19:57.240 --> 03:20:05.800]  that all of this crap has floated to the top
[03:20:05.800 --> 03:20:09.720]  afraid to answer it afraid to answer your door

[03:23:56.600 --> 03:24:11.160]  i hear the train coming it's rolling around you know the government says let's take the
[03:24:11.160 --> 03:24:15.560]  rights of these muslims but then that sets the precedent for everybody else
[03:24:15.560 --> 03:24:18.920]  they've got the enemy belligerent act that says u.s citizens can be grabbed by
[03:24:18.920 --> 03:24:23.400]  the military and held indefinitely and enhance interrogation can be used
[03:24:23.400 --> 03:24:27.160]  you know i don't like oj simpson i think he's a nutty guy but
[03:24:27.160 --> 03:24:31.080]  he clearly did get framed with the blood with the
[03:24:31.080 --> 03:24:35.480]  agent in it that is meant to preserve the blood and of course we're talking to
[03:24:35.480 --> 03:24:38.200]  the mystery witness from the oj simpson
[03:24:38.200 --> 03:24:41.320]  trial right now this is a short segment long segment coming up we've got him
[03:24:41.320 --> 03:24:45.000]  the rest of the hour dr frantic whitehurst but i wanted to go back to the
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:48.920]  beginning what happened at the fbi crime lab
[03:24:48.920 --> 03:24:51.720]  why were you forced to take that risk as you said
[03:24:51.720 --> 03:24:54.600]  there could have been a bullet with your name on it why did you go through all
[03:24:54.600 --> 03:24:57.960]  that hell to get the whistleblower protection act through
[03:24:57.960 --> 03:25:03.320]  and and now they're coming back with sb 372 to try to reverse that
[03:25:03.320 --> 03:25:07.960]  well the day i walked through the door of the laboratory which was um
[03:25:07.960 --> 03:25:12.120]  oh i think it was june 16th 1986 was obvious to me it wasn't a forensic crime
[03:25:12.120 --> 03:25:15.560]  lab it wasn't a analytical laboratory it was a filthy big
[03:25:15.560 --> 03:25:20.440]  site and there were no protocols uh there was no
[03:25:20.440 --> 03:25:23.800]  cleanliness when you're trying to find material that you can't see with your
[03:25:23.800 --> 03:25:26.200]  eye you don't know whether it came from the crime
[03:25:26.200 --> 03:25:30.600]  lab or the crime scene um my initial approach to it was to
[03:25:30.600 --> 03:25:34.280]  just clean it up if people are not going to clean it up well i'll clean it up
[03:25:34.280 --> 03:25:39.480]  um i saw some things in the lab that that bothered me we do in any
[03:25:39.480 --> 03:25:42.360]  organization i'm sure people working with you or me would
[03:25:42.360 --> 03:25:46.520]  would question some of our judgment but he didn't i did signals green my head
[03:25:46.520 --> 03:25:49.240]  off i said there's a system here to work this out
[03:25:49.240 --> 03:25:52.440]  i took these issues over a period of six seven years
[03:25:52.440 --> 03:25:56.200]  up through the chain of command step by step by step and
[03:25:56.200 --> 03:26:01.000]  at every chain at every point somebody said to me well i know there's issues
[03:26:01.000 --> 03:26:04.760]  however it's not your cross to bear that i okay well
[03:26:04.760 --> 03:26:08.120]  it is my cross to bear now first of all i'm an american citizen
[03:26:08.120 --> 03:26:11.800]  you know the way i say it is i am an american
[03:26:11.800 --> 03:26:16.280]  okay that's important to me therefore it is my cross to bear
[03:26:16.280 --> 03:26:19.880]  but um let's see what the management will do about it
[03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:23.720]  they never would do anything about it we were required by executive order one
[03:26:23.720 --> 03:26:26.520]  two six seven board report fraud waste abuse and corruption
[03:26:26.520 --> 03:26:30.360]  the appropriate authority the big word there is appropriate
[03:26:30.360 --> 03:26:33.800]  if i tell you there's a problem here and you blow me off you're no longer
[03:26:33.800 --> 03:26:36.440]  appropriate i did that all the way up to and including
[03:26:36.440 --> 03:26:39.640]  the president's office i mean over to the white house
[03:26:39.640 --> 03:26:44.520]  there was no appropriate authority within the u.s department of justice
[03:26:44.520 --> 03:26:49.080]  in the executive branch at all to address the issues i brought for there
[03:26:49.080 --> 03:26:53.240]  was no appropriate authority and so finally through the u.s congress and
[03:26:53.240 --> 03:26:56.520]  the inspector general's office we took the issues to the american people and
[03:26:56.520 --> 03:27:00.360]  by golly the american people are the appropriate authority
[03:27:00.360 --> 03:27:03.960]  if we don't like what's going on we don't need to pick up arms we have
[03:27:03.960 --> 03:27:08.280]  mechanisms it's very costly to use those mechanisms
[03:27:08.280 --> 03:27:11.880]  they will send you to the shrink just like out of the old soviet union
[03:27:11.880 --> 03:27:16.760]  oh well he's a troubled man they'll take you from your
[03:27:16.760 --> 03:27:20.760]  office in one place and put you in another they'll harass your wife
[03:27:20.760 --> 03:27:25.160]  they snide comments give you bad performance appraisals
[03:27:25.160 --> 03:27:29.160]  will never happen to me but um it happened to a number of my colleagues
[03:27:29.160 --> 03:27:33.480]  all of those kinds of things that say wow these people are not going to address
[03:27:33.480 --> 03:27:36.200]  the problem they're going to try and shut it down
[03:27:36.200 --> 03:27:41.640]  well um you know when the president of the united states has refused
[03:27:41.640 --> 03:27:45.000]  to require the u.s department of justice
[03:27:45.000 --> 03:27:50.040]  and that the fbi to obey federal law federal whistleblower act
[03:27:50.040 --> 03:27:55.000]  they just never obeyed it they just but no bullet doesn't apply to us
[03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:58.280]  that means those people consider themselves above the law and in this
[03:27:58.280 --> 03:28:01.800]  country no one is above the law no one
[03:28:01.800 --> 03:28:06.360]  not even the president and we see this system everywhere where 800 plus cities
[03:28:06.360 --> 03:28:09.240]  are sanctuary cities where illegal aliens
[03:28:09.240 --> 03:28:13.000]  here in austin can drunk drive and kill people
[03:28:13.000 --> 03:28:16.760]  and they get released but citizens get the book thrown at them
[03:28:16.760 --> 03:28:20.680]  because politically the government wants more illegals here for whatever reason
[03:28:20.680 --> 03:28:24.280]  i mean that's just another example now now from your experience
[03:28:24.280 --> 03:28:27.800]  what percentage of of of crime lab people
[03:28:27.800 --> 03:28:31.320]  thought somebody was guilty and so they planted the evidence like with what
[03:28:31.320 --> 03:28:36.360]  happened with oj simpson with the uh la pd and then
[03:28:36.360 --> 03:28:39.800]  and i know it's not an exact number versus
[03:28:39.800 --> 03:28:43.160]  what percentage were just sloppy and didn't care
[03:28:43.160 --> 03:28:46.840]  well you know there's another there's another percentage sir and that's the
[03:28:46.840 --> 03:28:50.680]  people who work very very hard and really do care
[03:28:50.680 --> 03:28:55.400]  what happens in the crime lab is they've got the data
[03:28:55.400 --> 03:28:59.720]  and back when i was involved with this system and i still am but gradually
[03:28:59.720 --> 03:29:04.360]  come out of it um they're stuck with this issue
[03:29:04.360 --> 03:29:08.280]  the issue is well the guy's probably guilty of something
[03:29:08.280 --> 03:29:14.200]  if i report this stuff i'm gonna lose my job so what's more important my family
[03:29:14.200 --> 03:29:19.720]  or my oath of office and my nation and that's a hard decision to make
[03:29:19.720 --> 03:29:22.680]  when the president of the united states himself
[03:29:22.680 --> 03:29:26.920]  doesn't care doesn't care i mean you know
[03:29:26.920 --> 03:29:31.400]  what do you do well you finally have to find an answer within yourself
[03:29:31.400 --> 03:29:36.840]  this is my country i am an american and i'm not going to tolerate this
[03:29:36.840 --> 03:29:40.920]  oh stay there stay there a long segment coming up we've got to stand up when we
[03:29:40.920 --> 03:29:44.920]  see wrongdoing or corruption we've got to stand up
[03:29:44.920 --> 03:29:51.480]  absolutely the solution is in the mirror we'll be right back
[03:29:51.480 --> 03:29:55.320]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[03:29:55.320 --> 03:30:00.840]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:00.840 --> 03:30:04.360]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[03:30:04.360 --> 03:30:07.720]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[03:30:07.720 --> 03:30:11.080]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[03:30:11.080 --> 03:30:14.280]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds that all perform even
[03:30:14.280 --> 03:30:17.560]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[03:30:17.560 --> 03:30:20.440]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[03:30:20.440 --> 03:30:23.560]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[03:30:23.560 --> 03:30:27.080]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[03:31:28.440 --> 03:31:31.960]  how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:31:31.960 --> 03:31:35.800]  to establish an oppressive world government i believe first of all
[03:31:35.800 --> 03:31:39.000]  that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[03:31:39.000 --> 03:31:42.760]  financial system global governance with the establishment of the g20
[03:31:42.760 --> 03:31:46.440]  so it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else

[03:33:19.000 --> 03:33:23.240]  Dr. Frederick Weiner's FBI crime lab missile blower
[03:33:23.240 --> 03:33:26.520]  is our guest going right back to him so there's these
[03:33:26.520 --> 03:33:31.160]  three or four groups i mean there's people who mean well and you were
[03:33:31.160 --> 03:33:34.200]  telling me during the break but are fed fake evidence
[03:33:34.200 --> 03:33:37.560]  there's some in there that actually frame people or make the decision there's
[03:33:37.560 --> 03:33:43.480]  others that are just lazy there's others that want attention
[03:33:43.480 --> 03:33:47.080]  it's just that with all these city crime labs it comes out that they are
[03:33:47.080 --> 03:33:52.440]  just framing people in mass and we'll talk about some of those cases as well
[03:33:52.440 --> 03:33:56.040]  but i tend to agree with you that things are actually getting better it just
[03:33:56.040 --> 03:33:59.000]  looks like things are worse because now we're
[03:33:59.000 --> 03:34:02.760]  lancing the wound we're seeing the pus yes sir
[03:34:02.760 --> 03:34:06.600]  i mean to be like if you're a serial killers back 40
[03:34:06.600 --> 03:34:10.440]  and you dig up the 25 bodies things aren't getting worse you've actually
[03:34:10.440 --> 03:34:13.640]  stopped the serial killer you've got them in custody now
[03:34:13.640 --> 03:34:17.720]  it just looks like it's getting worse because you've now discovered the crime
[03:34:17.720 --> 03:34:22.360]  you got it you know they call them crime lab sometimes because
[03:34:22.360 --> 03:34:25.720]  the crime is in the lab
[03:34:26.280 --> 03:34:32.280]  but uh you know the labs are frankly completely absolutely overwhelmed
[03:34:32.280 --> 03:34:37.240]  overworked uh when you're just reading an article during the break about san
[03:34:37.240 --> 03:34:42.040]  francisco crime lab they're doing 7 000 cases or you know each
[03:34:42.040 --> 03:34:45.480]  exam there's no way you could do science at that period
[03:34:45.480 --> 03:34:48.920]  and you know what's amazing to me san francisco is uh
[03:34:48.920 --> 03:34:53.000]  tells itself is one of the most progressive thought product
[03:34:53.000 --> 03:34:56.680]  think tanks if you will in the country i'm not sure about that because i'm from
[03:34:56.680 --> 03:35:01.400]  north carolina but um that kind of thing that's going on in san francisco has
[03:35:01.400 --> 03:35:05.240]  been happening for years and we brought it to the attention to
[03:35:05.240 --> 03:35:08.920]  those folks out there and uh judges don't do anything
[03:35:08.920 --> 03:35:12.520]  about it courts don't do anything about it defense attorneys are overwhelmed
[03:35:12.520 --> 03:35:18.520]  the labs overwhelmed and well okay um if what happens in crime labs happening
[03:35:18.520 --> 03:35:21.960]  clinical laboratories there'd be bodies all over the place
[03:35:21.960 --> 03:35:27.320]  but there'll also be lawsuits you know these people have immunity from lawsuit
[03:35:27.320 --> 03:35:32.200]  if a doctor carried out in his business like crime labs carry on their business
[03:35:32.200 --> 03:35:36.040]  um he wouldn't be a doctor very long so this this
[03:35:36.040 --> 03:35:41.720]  state immunity that you've gotten at crime labs as as well as no audit
[03:35:41.720 --> 03:35:44.360]  function there's no outside audit function at all
[03:35:44.360 --> 03:35:47.480]  you know you'll be told the american society crime laboratory directors
[03:35:47.480 --> 03:35:52.200]  audits these labs my goodness they've been auditing these labs work for years
[03:35:52.200 --> 03:35:55.800]  nothing's happened that's just a good old boy network so
[03:35:55.800 --> 03:36:00.840]  you've got a human enterprise that has no oversight no oversight at all sir
[03:36:00.840 --> 03:36:04.680]  none and on top of that the oversight system that's
[03:36:04.680 --> 03:36:08.040]  supposed to to to work which is the court system
[03:36:08.040 --> 03:36:11.960]  is completely overwhelmed we're going to arrest people all over this country for
[03:36:11.960 --> 03:36:14.920]  all kinds of things we're successfully doing it as you mentioned
[03:36:14.920 --> 03:36:18.360]  we have the largest per capita prison population in the world
[03:36:18.360 --> 03:36:21.400]  but there's there's just a point where the system breaks and it breaks pretty
[03:36:21.400 --> 03:36:26.040]  quickly under this kind of overload the bad people in the system
[03:36:26.040 --> 03:36:30.760]  relieve the stress of the overload by just lying by doing something
[03:36:30.760 --> 03:36:34.120]  very often called dry latic dry latic means you didn't even you didn't even
[03:36:34.120 --> 03:36:38.200]  conduct the analysis you simply took a chart out of a
[03:36:38.200 --> 03:36:42.040]  out of a drawer and label as if it came from the analysis and go on to the next
[03:36:42.040 --> 03:36:45.080]  case and you've got an overloaded system
[03:36:45.080 --> 03:36:50.200]  without any outside oversight it's easy to institute that oversight but the
[03:36:50.200 --> 03:36:53.400]  government doesn't allow it to happen our government
[03:36:53.400 --> 03:36:57.080]  your listeners do not allow the laboratories
[03:36:57.080 --> 03:37:01.880]  in the state of texas to be audited by independent audit functions
[03:37:01.880 --> 03:37:05.960]  when there's a problem the government decides who's going to audit your labs
[03:37:05.960 --> 03:37:10.200]  that's crazy i'm saying that the government officials law enforcement
[03:37:10.200 --> 03:37:15.400]  not some entity here's here's an example clinical laboratories have to answer
[03:37:15.400 --> 03:37:19.480]  to the clinical laboratory improvement act of 1991
[03:37:19.480 --> 03:37:25.800]  it takes more oversight to determine you have a sore throat than to execute
[03:37:25.800 --> 03:37:29.320]  you sir you can be executed because of a crime
[03:37:29.320 --> 03:37:33.000]  laboratory that has no oversight at all but a doctor going into your throat to
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:36.200]  determine if you have a sore throat as a paperwork
[03:37:36.200 --> 03:37:41.160]  trail that he's very well aware could take away his license to practice
[03:37:41.160 --> 03:37:45.800]  so we have a systematic control until the people decide
[03:37:45.800 --> 03:37:50.200]  and this this falls right back in the seat of of of your listeners sir
[03:37:50.200 --> 03:37:52.840]  until they decide this is not going to happen
[03:37:52.840 --> 03:37:56.520]  i am not going to be um threatened by this
[03:37:56.520 --> 03:37:59.880]  let's just put it in place oh it's going to cost some money
[03:37:59.880 --> 03:38:03.080]  here in north carolina we put daily these in the middle of our highways down
[03:38:03.080 --> 03:38:08.280]  there in texas you put blue on it okay let's put a few less blue on it and
[03:38:08.280 --> 03:38:12.200]  let's get auditors not crime laboratory people auditors and
[03:38:12.200 --> 03:38:15.800]  look at those labs well is that going to happen
[03:38:15.800 --> 03:38:20.280]  um it's not going to happen unless the the people that are in texas
[03:38:20.280 --> 03:38:23.880]  in the united states decided not this enough all right dr whitehurst let's
[03:38:23.880 --> 03:38:27.880]  bring this down to the bottom line yes every major police department i've
[03:38:27.880 --> 03:38:31.800]  ever even randomly googled has had big scandals with their crime
[03:38:31.800 --> 03:38:36.120]  labs and that's with most states having almost no oversight
[03:38:36.120 --> 03:38:40.840]  it's it's you're the same thing as the national security act of 47
[03:38:40.840 --> 03:38:44.040]  where us intelligence has almost no oversight
[03:38:44.040 --> 03:38:48.440]  unlimited secret budgets can do whatever they want and of course the cia
[03:38:48.440 --> 03:38:52.920]  had to admit in 96 with their inspector general that they were shipping in cocaine
[03:38:52.920 --> 03:38:58.600]  because if you give people that much power and allow them to run wild with no
[03:38:58.600 --> 03:39:02.600]  oversight criminals are going to run to get into those
[03:39:02.600 --> 03:39:06.200]  positions of power because inside a government position
[03:39:06.200 --> 03:39:09.320]  they can get away with murder where they couldn't get away with it
[03:39:09.320 --> 03:39:13.000]  as a private uh criminal we know that high functioning
[03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:16.920]  psychopaths gravitate towards government positions we know that's the
[03:39:16.920 --> 03:39:21.080]  basic criminology this is common sense that's why nine times out of 10 you get
[03:39:21.080 --> 03:39:25.560]  a tyranny not a free society freedom is a precious jewel that thomas
[03:39:25.560 --> 03:39:28.920]  jefferson said even if you defend it you're probably going
[03:39:28.920 --> 03:39:33.880]  to lose it and so we know that these crime labs by and large are a fraud
[03:39:33.880 --> 03:39:38.040]  there's this crisis of confidence as we learn
[03:39:38.040 --> 03:39:41.240]  uh that there's all this fraud and instead of crime labs now they're moving
[03:39:41.240 --> 03:39:44.520]  the new quackery that makes a lie detector tests that have
[03:39:44.520 --> 03:39:48.200]  been proven to be a fraud pale in significance they have fake brain
[03:39:48.200 --> 03:39:51.640]  scanners they have uh all these other systems that
[03:39:51.640 --> 03:39:54.440]  supposedly show if you're really guilty and have been proven to be frauds
[03:39:54.440 --> 03:39:59.960]  quackery uh we have uh all these fake informants lying
[03:39:59.960 --> 03:40:04.280]  about people setting people up being caught over and over again
[03:40:04.280 --> 03:40:09.000]  lying for money we have police uh and all these scandals admitting that they
[03:40:09.000 --> 03:40:12.680]  lied on the stand and that it's condoned so there is this culture of
[03:40:12.680 --> 03:40:16.600]  corruption from the top going down throughout the
[03:40:16.600 --> 03:40:19.640]  system and you say the people have to fix it
[03:40:19.640 --> 03:40:22.760]  uh we know we have the biggest prison population in the world it's ballooning
[03:40:22.760 --> 03:40:28.520]  everywhere what do we do then if if the system is just
[03:40:28.520 --> 03:40:31.960]  rotting from the head down and and and there's just so much
[03:40:31.960 --> 03:40:36.840]  corruption well you know i might add to that the safest place for a serial
[03:40:36.840 --> 03:40:40.680]  criminal in the united states is in a crime laboratory
[03:40:40.680 --> 03:40:43.960]  he can get away with it again and again and again and he has
[03:40:43.960 --> 03:40:48.120]  there's no oversight and he's immune from prosecution
[03:40:48.120 --> 03:40:52.920]  and you can you can count on your left hand the number of these folks that
[03:40:52.920 --> 03:40:57.480]  have been prosecuted you know if uh if you put a man away
[03:40:57.480 --> 03:41:02.840]  for for 18 years with a lie that by golly you ought to go take his place
[03:41:02.840 --> 03:41:06.600]  and finish out his term and your retirement check ought to go into
[03:41:06.600 --> 03:41:11.160]  helping the the country pay that man what he's owed
[03:41:11.160 --> 03:41:14.920]  but what is the solution we've got a problem we've got a
[03:41:14.920 --> 03:41:19.880]  a a society here where the solution is it's at the polls
[03:41:19.880 --> 03:41:24.680]  it said you know i'm a child of the of the 60s i'm 62 years old now and i
[03:41:24.680 --> 03:41:29.720]  remember people became involved we weren't attached to an iphone
[03:41:29.720 --> 03:41:35.080]  in an ipod in a in a whatever computer screen we got up and we saw what was
[03:41:35.080 --> 03:41:39.000]  going on around us and we even we we raised our voices i'm not
[03:41:39.000 --> 03:41:42.680]  saying raise your gun i do not believe in that kind of
[03:41:42.680 --> 03:41:46.200]  revolution i was in vietnam for three years and i don't want that happening
[03:41:46.200 --> 03:41:51.080]  in my country but we have the ability here nobody kills me yet
[03:41:51.080 --> 03:41:54.680]  it's just you know in some countries that'd be amazing i'd have been dead
[03:41:54.680 --> 03:41:59.000]  20 years ago nobody shot me now they made life miserable for me and my family
[03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:01.800]  and people around me that supported what i was saying
[03:42:01.800 --> 03:42:06.840]  but we weren't killed you have the right to come forward and do something
[03:42:06.840 --> 03:42:11.320]  to collect the data one of the things forensic justice project does sir
[03:42:11.320 --> 03:42:14.840]  is we're tracking all the victim defendants
[03:42:14.840 --> 03:42:18.600]  i'm not saying defendants or victims i'm saying victim defendants
[03:42:18.600 --> 03:42:22.120]  of the individuals that were pointed out in the
[03:42:22.120 --> 03:42:26.680]  investigation of the fbi crime lab that's a really neat project
[03:42:26.680 --> 03:42:31.000]  in most of our states we have open records citizen groups
[03:42:31.000 --> 03:42:34.520]  can take the ipod out of their their ear
[03:42:34.520 --> 03:42:38.200]  and petition the government for the names of every case
[03:42:38.200 --> 03:42:42.680]  that bad guys ever work and then go find those people
[03:42:42.680 --> 03:42:45.480]  find out if they're in prison if they've been executed
[03:42:45.480 --> 03:42:49.080]  and we can do that passing the information around all over the country
[03:42:49.080 --> 03:42:52.920]  and we will launch and and have launched an army
[03:42:52.920 --> 03:42:57.320]  doing that when one man goes to jail sir he has a family and he has friends and
[03:42:57.320 --> 03:43:00.680]  if they know he's innocent and they see the system
[03:43:00.680 --> 03:43:04.200]  do that to him they do respond they just don't throw their hands up
[03:43:04.200 --> 03:43:08.200]  and we've already won the first stage of the battle we've gone from 20 years ago
[03:43:08.200 --> 03:43:11.960]  the average person saying no way the police ever frame anybody
[03:43:11.960 --> 03:43:17.080]  to the population in polls know they frame whoever they want whenever they
[03:43:17.080 --> 03:43:20.760]  want and it's causing people to realize this is a
[03:43:20.760 --> 03:43:23.480]  fraud a lot of innocent people are getting out of prison
[03:43:23.480 --> 03:43:27.720]  when you talk to the average police officer or current fbi agent
[03:43:27.720 --> 03:43:31.240]  or other whistleblowers that you talk to you know the average cop on the beat
[03:43:31.240 --> 03:43:33.320]  because i know you travel around the country and talk to folks
[03:43:33.320 --> 03:43:38.280]  does the average cop realize how incredibly corrupt the system is and
[03:43:38.280 --> 03:43:44.360]  do they defend it you know what i think i was on the inside of the fb and i saw
[03:43:44.360 --> 03:43:49.000]  the stuff and i saw how sick people were at the
[03:43:49.000 --> 03:43:53.080]  things that were going on from voucher fraud to time in a tenant sheet fraud
[03:43:53.080 --> 03:43:56.120]  to to you know you go to court and as a whole
[03:43:56.120 --> 03:44:00.760]  crew there and one of the guys is have obviously lying and you know that
[03:44:00.760 --> 03:44:03.560]  they're sick about it they're sick about it but sir
[03:44:03.560 --> 03:44:07.000]  you know the structure we have right now forces
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:11.560]  those people those good people to decide between their family security
[03:44:11.560 --> 03:44:16.280]  or their oath of office and that's a dilemma we shouldn't put in their hands
[03:44:16.280 --> 03:44:20.520]  they should know that when they come forward with valid
[03:44:20.520 --> 03:44:26.760]  documented proof that that guy who did what he did will not be protected by
[03:44:26.760 --> 03:44:31.000]  his his um you know his what do you call him in the bureau is
[03:44:31.000 --> 03:44:35.000]  juice man not be protected by his management structure will
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:39.160]  be tried in a court of law as a criminal a serial criminal
[03:44:39.160 --> 03:44:44.200]  in sent to prison no no no immunity you lied under oath
[03:44:44.200 --> 03:44:47.880]  you lied under oath you're going away you altered evidence you're going away
[03:44:47.880 --> 03:44:51.240]  there's a man i've been been tracking since 1989
[03:44:51.240 --> 03:44:56.120]  that's 21 years now sir and collecting information on
[03:44:56.120 --> 03:44:59.800]  it's well known he lied in the trial of a federal judge
[03:44:59.800 --> 03:45:04.840]  well documented it was documented four years after he did it the fbi
[03:45:04.840 --> 03:45:09.800]  covered it up for nine more years they they then admitted it but said the
[03:45:09.800 --> 03:45:12.920]  issue was too stale they wouldn't revisit it the man retired before
[03:45:12.920 --> 03:45:16.840]  retirement and four years five years later the fbi
[03:45:16.840 --> 03:45:21.080]  rehired him as a contract employee and he's now involved in national security
[03:45:21.080 --> 03:45:23.880]  issues so i'm i'm tracking i want to know
[03:45:23.880 --> 03:45:27.480]  every everything about every day he ever spent the fbi and it's it's kind of
[03:45:27.480 --> 03:45:31.240]  fascinating they're doing everything they can to stop us from it
[03:45:31.240 --> 03:45:34.760]  um i'm 62 i've probably got another 20 good years
[03:45:34.760 --> 03:45:38.120]  i'm not so the answer is we have to pick a criminal
[03:45:38.120 --> 03:45:42.600]  and helm them and bring them to justice and with the internet we can that that's
[03:45:42.600 --> 03:45:47.560]  what i've always said yes these if a politician you don't need to helm them
[03:45:47.560 --> 03:45:52.520]  as citizens helming is what you need is just to collect the data
[03:45:52.520 --> 03:45:56.280]  collect the data and as a citizen group um
[03:45:56.280 --> 03:45:59.960]  it's a fascinating thing any bit of data by the way i've got i'll give away to
[03:45:59.960 --> 03:46:02.840]  anybody well doctor when i say hound i mean a hound just keeps
[03:46:02.840 --> 03:46:06.200]  tracking and never stops yes sir that's what i mean by
[03:46:06.200 --> 03:46:09.960]  hounding i don't mean to open you just you just go after them
[03:46:09.960 --> 03:46:14.600]  you bite on to that you don't you don't not denigrate you do not slander you
[03:46:14.600 --> 03:46:17.560]  just collect the data and i've got six seven
[03:46:17.560 --> 03:46:20.520]  thousand fbi files under freedom of information act now
[03:46:20.520 --> 03:46:23.640]  i've only processed about one fifth of those
[03:46:23.640 --> 03:46:27.000]  and the stuff that's coming out of those files is phenomenal
[03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:31.320]  you need to remember why you're doing this just because one man lied
[03:46:31.320 --> 03:46:35.880]  in a trial does not make the defendant innocent or guilty
[03:46:35.880 --> 03:46:40.760]  it means one man lied in that defendant a fellow citizen no matter what he was
[03:46:40.760 --> 03:46:46.360]  accused of doing deserves the right to a fair trial this is america sir
[03:46:46.360 --> 03:46:49.640]  he deserves the right to a fair trial and if the government won't give it to
[03:46:49.640 --> 03:46:53.000]  me the elected government the appointed government
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:57.080]  then the government calls the people and we are the government of this country
[03:46:57.080 --> 03:47:00.200]  can give it to me absolutely let's shift gears for a moment here's the new york
[03:47:00.200 --> 03:47:03.720]  times dna evidence can be fabricated scientists show
[03:47:03.720 --> 03:47:06.760]  they also admit that the police know how to take your prints
[03:47:06.760 --> 03:47:09.960]  create a silicon copy and plant them wherever they want
[03:47:09.960 --> 03:47:13.560]  yeah i've been warning the public about this for a decade it's now becoming
[03:47:13.560 --> 03:47:18.280]  mainstream news but we see the media now selling dna
[03:47:18.280 --> 03:47:21.720]  as if it's a hundred percent they want a federal dna database they've been taking
[03:47:21.720 --> 03:47:25.480]  blood from babies for more than 30 years for a secret pentagon database that's
[03:47:25.480 --> 03:47:30.360]  now been declassified uh i see this is a new fraud
[03:47:30.360 --> 03:47:34.200]  where they can arrest you take your blood plant it and then say oh we know you
[03:47:34.200 --> 03:47:39.000]  did it that's right so sir it's not the science
[03:47:39.000 --> 03:47:43.560]  it is the scientist that we must concern ourselves with
[03:47:43.560 --> 03:47:47.800]  and anyone anyone that is that is accused
[03:47:47.800 --> 03:47:53.000]  should audit that work product that's an extremely expensive process
[03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:56.600]  extremely to audit that work product but um
[03:47:56.600 --> 03:48:00.200]  you know this lady at the san francisco lab had been there 29 years
[03:48:00.200 --> 03:48:04.440]  i know i was in a trial hearing about three four years ago in which
[03:48:04.440 --> 03:48:09.160]  her word was overrode mine before a federal judge
[03:48:09.160 --> 03:48:12.920]  and there she was as they addicted to crack cocaine
[03:48:12.920 --> 03:48:17.720]  as a violent criminal with a gun and the court accepted what she said
[03:48:17.720 --> 03:48:21.400]  well i'm not going to let that go uh you know that
[03:48:21.400 --> 03:48:25.160]  that thing of educating and let's put it out on the mainstream
[03:48:25.160 --> 03:48:29.880]  here's where we've won sir when i first joined the fbi 1982 there was no media
[03:48:29.880 --> 03:48:33.880]  denigration at all of the fbi now if you see a movie they're in
[03:48:33.880 --> 03:48:37.880]  they're the clowns if you you know their reputation of the fbi has been
[03:48:37.880 --> 03:48:42.360]  soiled by those people by those people that cross the blue
[03:48:42.360 --> 03:48:46.760]  line and tarnish their badge it's been soiled and the fbi didn't take care of
[03:48:46.760 --> 03:48:50.360]  it so the fbi is this horrible public relations deal
[03:48:50.360 --> 03:48:55.400]  they had to overcome but the american people know it through their culture
[03:48:55.400 --> 03:48:57.880]  you know there's a show on television called dexter
[03:48:57.880 --> 03:49:00.440]  is a serial criminal he works in the crime lab
[03:49:00.440 --> 03:49:04.920]  well where do you think that idea came from it came from
[03:49:04.920 --> 03:49:09.800]  it's it's almost daily in the news that a crime lab has had trouble
[03:49:09.800 --> 03:49:13.320]  i think we need to be careful that we don't
[03:49:13.320 --> 03:49:18.520]  trash every crime lab technician out there we need we just need to question
[03:49:18.520 --> 03:49:22.680]  their work product very closely we need to keep them honest and we know there's
[03:49:22.680 --> 03:49:25.480]  a major problem here and it's important when you've
[03:49:25.480 --> 03:49:29.480]  got a big military industrial complex owning and building more prisons and
[03:49:29.480 --> 03:49:32.920]  they want to cram us all in them it's a life and death situation
[03:49:32.920 --> 03:49:38.120]  that that that we uh you know point out to people
[03:49:38.120 --> 03:49:41.880]  that these groups can't be trusted and we've got to keep them honest
[03:49:41.880 --> 03:49:45.560]  why should we trust them a scientist does not trust the work of another
[03:49:45.560 --> 03:49:48.440]  scientist he always questions it that's science
[03:49:48.440 --> 03:49:51.960]  just look at al gore look at al gore saying you cannot question
[03:49:51.960 --> 03:49:54.680]  the global warming hypothesis and it turns out
[03:49:54.680 --> 03:49:58.680]  hundreds of universities under u n control working together in a concerted
[03:49:58.680 --> 03:50:03.160]  fraud you know that's one of these the kids now say
[03:50:03.160 --> 03:50:07.160]  uh i mean i can't i can't imagine anybody trust an al gore
[03:50:07.160 --> 03:50:13.080]  so frankly can't i you know you know i i better not get started on that
[03:50:13.080 --> 03:50:16.760]  no let's get started on it i mean it's i'm a phd chemist
[03:50:16.760 --> 03:50:20.760]  okay i mean i've got a degree in chemistry besides having a law degree
[03:50:20.760 --> 03:50:24.920]  okay and i and i looked at what that man was doing and i said oh my gosh this
[03:50:24.920 --> 03:50:28.280]  is in the white house come on and what a
[03:50:28.280 --> 03:50:31.880]  absolute buffoon he was and where well we're not even
[03:50:31.880 --> 03:50:35.480]  we're not even describing it as buffoonery i mean oh my goodness
[03:50:35.480 --> 03:50:40.280]  and and so what do we have we've got this now we don't know whether the global
[03:50:40.280 --> 03:50:44.040]  warming or not sir we really don't know because
[03:50:44.040 --> 03:50:47.640]  you know there's some good scientists out there that believe it but there's some
[03:50:47.640 --> 03:50:53.080]  frauds out there that are pushing it like y2k you remember the y2k thing

[03:54:41.640 --> 03:54:45.640]  children is a way to get al-qaeda to talk they're trying to warp our minds and
[03:54:45.640 --> 03:54:49.640]  dr. frederick whitehurst uh one of the top guys at the fbi crime
[03:54:49.640 --> 03:54:53.000]  lab who blew the whistle back in the late 90s early nine
[03:54:53.000 --> 03:54:58.120]  was it 1996 doctor well actually the the the whistle blowing if you call it that
[03:54:58.120 --> 03:55:02.120]  started about 1992 and went to about 1998
[03:55:02.120 --> 03:55:05.560]  sure but i just remember seeing it peaking there in the mid 90s
[03:55:05.560 --> 03:55:10.760]  yeah that's correct um i was talking during the break and i was saying
[03:55:10.760 --> 03:55:13.400]  the government knows they're losing all credibility
[03:55:13.400 --> 03:55:17.240]  they they're trying to recruit criminals not just in the upper ranks but mid and
[03:55:17.240 --> 03:55:20.040]  even lower they're trying to perfect a tyranny
[03:55:20.040 --> 03:55:23.480]  they don't intend on fixing any of this because they don't think it's broken
[03:55:23.480 --> 03:55:27.240]  they want to go with a full authoritarian takeover and you said
[03:55:27.240 --> 03:55:31.000]  absolutely that's what i see happening can you speak to that
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:34.920]  i think was what's happening there is they are not going to address these
[03:55:34.920 --> 03:55:38.600]  issues they're going to bully people that bring them forward
[03:55:38.600 --> 03:55:43.400]  uh you know if we're willing to just go to day to day and let things happen
[03:55:43.400 --> 03:55:47.160]  they're going to bully people that are bringing these things for now and i
[03:55:47.160 --> 03:55:50.600]  believe that if you're up top and you're going to
[03:55:50.600 --> 03:55:54.520]  lose your cushy job because it turns out that your laboratory
[03:55:54.520 --> 03:55:57.480]  is a mess or that you're the the problem or whatever
[03:55:57.480 --> 03:56:01.880]  and that's what i went through at the fbi labs are and so what you end up with
[03:56:01.880 --> 03:56:06.600]  is some is criminals essentially uh moving up to the top
[03:56:06.600 --> 03:56:10.760]  uh they had an oath of office it that's a sacred oath i don't know what people
[03:56:10.760 --> 03:56:14.040]  do when they raise their hand and take a oath of office some of them are probably
[03:56:14.040 --> 03:56:17.640]  swatting it flies i wasn't swatting it flies i had an oath
[03:56:17.640 --> 03:56:21.240]  of office and by the way i won't give it up just because they let me go
[03:56:21.240 --> 03:56:25.400]  i'm not giving it up i'm not an fbi agent but i am an american
[03:56:25.400 --> 03:56:32.040]  and so what happens they're above the law they can do anything and get away
[03:56:32.040 --> 03:56:35.880]  with it and they do anything and get away with it
[03:56:35.880 --> 03:56:40.920]  uh they've got the control over how to put the information out
[03:56:40.920 --> 03:56:45.160]  or think they do this internet thing is beautiful because we can talk to each
[03:56:45.160 --> 03:56:47.880]  other i don't see massive conspiracies or
[03:56:47.880 --> 03:56:51.880]  i just see a lot of people that shouldn't be in in control in our nation
[03:56:51.880 --> 03:56:56.040]  are in control um and you know as i said to you before that
[03:56:56.040 --> 03:56:59.880]  that senate bill 372 is an example if you read it
[03:56:59.880 --> 03:57:03.080]  it's an appalling example of what they want to do
[03:57:03.080 --> 03:57:06.520]  they want to get control over good law enforcement officers
[03:57:06.520 --> 03:57:10.920]  good fbis and good government employees and shut them down anybody that would
[03:57:10.920 --> 03:57:14.920]  propose that is showing his stripes for what he is
[03:57:14.920 --> 03:57:19.080]  that the fact that that would get even in the consideration in the u.s senate
[03:57:19.080 --> 03:57:23.960]  is crazy they're talking about shutting down any oversight any oversight
[03:57:23.960 --> 03:57:27.880]  whatsoever the fbi and that's sp 372 and in closing
[03:57:27.880 --> 03:57:31.640]  i've studied history i'm sure you've studied it lawyer fbi agent
[03:57:31.640 --> 03:57:37.000]  scientist chemist in every case once people give in to a little corruption
[03:57:37.000 --> 03:57:40.760]  then it's a little more than worse criminals get in more ruthless get in
[03:57:40.760 --> 03:57:44.040]  and it always just gets worse and worse until it's hitler
[03:57:44.040 --> 03:57:47.960]  or mouse a tongue and we're racing towards that now i don't think people
[03:57:47.960 --> 03:57:52.600]  understand this is do or die this is an all or nothing exercise for the evil
[03:57:52.600 --> 03:57:55.480]  people and it's an all or nothing exercise for the good
[03:57:55.480 --> 03:57:59.640]  guys well i think i agree with you but when
[03:57:59.640 --> 03:58:05.480]  we say all or nothing sir we're talking about lawful disobedience of this
[03:58:05.480 --> 03:58:09.800]  lawfully saying no i am not talking about militia
[03:58:09.800 --> 03:58:13.560]  and i am not talking about violence i'm talking about the tools that we have in
[03:58:13.560 --> 03:58:16.840]  our society being used effective to let people
[03:58:16.840 --> 03:58:21.400]  who get up or they aren't here and just say i'm not going to let this happen
[03:58:21.400 --> 03:58:26.360]  i absolutely agree with you folks can visit whistleblowers.org find out more
