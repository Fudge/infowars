[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  It's Monday, July 4th, 2022.
[00:06.000 --> 00:12.000]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I'm extremely honored and blessed to be here with you for
[00:12.000 --> 00:15.000]  this special broadcast.
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  It was an article that came up on Saturday at infowords.com.
[00:18.000 --> 00:23.000]  We're going to cover in the next segment that explains it all.
[00:23.000 --> 00:31.000]  The U.S. under more tyranny now than in 1776 says well-known, respected historian Douglas
[00:31.000 --> 00:32.000]  McKinnon.
[00:32.000 --> 00:33.000]  That is coming up next segment.
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.000]  And that is the whole point of this July 4th broadcast.
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  If you look at the medical tyranny and the open borders, the devaluation of currency and
[00:41.000 --> 00:46.000]  the pedophilia and the illegal surveillance and the censorship and the human animal cloning
[00:46.000 --> 00:52.000]  and all of it, it is insane the level of tyranny that we're already living under.
[00:52.000 --> 00:59.000]  But to defeat the tyranny, we must first identify who they are, what their modus operandi is,
[00:59.000 --> 01:01.000]  what their goal is to be able to stop them.
[01:01.000 --> 01:07.000]  They are transhumanist, mad scientist using behavioral psychology to control us.
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  And as soon as you pull up to the 35,000 foot view or the 100,000 foot view or the million foot view,
[01:13.000 --> 01:21.000]  you see the whole thing there and then you know how it all works and then you have power over it.
[01:21.000 --> 01:28.000]  But if you just debate this issue or that issue or this attack they're launching, you're fighting
[01:28.000 --> 01:37.000]  heads of the Hydra instead of actually going after the central heart of the matter that's
[01:37.000 --> 01:39.000]  launched that attack.
[01:39.000 --> 01:41.000]  So that's coming up next segment.
[01:41.000 --> 01:50.000]  But I got to tell you, to witness the enemies of humanity holding people hostage, preparing
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  new viruses, preparing new lockdowns and posing as the saviors.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  All out of one side of their mouth they say that the saviors and out of the other side of their mouth
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  they admit we're creating a new world.
[02:02.000 --> 02:13.000]  We are forcing people to transition not to some clean energy Star Trek utopia but to a dystopic reality.
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000]  And that's where we are in the year 2022.
[02:17.000 --> 02:23.000]  Everything we do here is about challenging that great lie and saying no to it.
[02:23.000 --> 02:28.000]  Now, I'll be here for a few segments, covering the latest news and developments and then we've got a great
[02:28.000 --> 02:35.000]  best of with Dr. Zelinko who died last Thursday, great patriot alive with us forever, with his thoughts
[02:35.000 --> 02:42.000]  and deeds and actions and of course spiritually we'll join him at the next level hopefully if we are able to make the cut.
[02:42.000 --> 02:47.000]  But that's coming up today and so much more and I wanted to take a few minutes out before we go to break
[02:47.000 --> 02:49.000]  and come back with all this news.
[02:49.000 --> 02:55.000]  Just say this, I've been on here 28 years and I've had some great crews and some good people.
[02:55.000 --> 03:00.000]  But I got to say the crew we've had the last three, four years has been an absolute godsend.
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  And I want them through that glass right there behind that camera right there to know I love you
[03:05.000 --> 03:11.000]  and I appreciate you and we couldn't have done any of this without you.
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  And if it's the last thing I do, I'm not going to let you down, you've not let me down.
[03:16.000 --> 03:24.000]  And I really, really appreciate you and thank you for everything you've done
[03:24.000 --> 03:28.000]  and your commitment to professionalism and focus and getting the job done.
[03:28.000 --> 03:34.000]  You are amazing and I just want on this July 4th to declare independence against the New World Order
[03:34.000 --> 03:36.000]  and independence against their whole satanic operation.
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  At the same time, I want to celebrate this crew and our listeners, the great activists, our race, color and creed,
[03:42.000 --> 03:50.000]  our affiliates, our sponsors, all of our friends like Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and President Bolsonaro
[03:50.000 --> 03:55.000]  and so many others that have supported what we're doing.
[03:55.000 --> 04:00.000]  This has been an incredible fight and we've won so many battles together
[04:00.000 --> 04:06.000]  but now we are coming into focus for the greatest challenge of our lives.
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.000]  And I can tell you, despite all the persecution and the hell we've been through,
[04:10.000 --> 04:15.000]  it's all been a learning process and we couldn't have understood this if God had put us through this.
[04:15.000 --> 04:23.000]  So above all, I want to thank my creator respectfully and humbly for the gift of consciousness, great creator.
[04:23.000 --> 04:29.000]  And thank you for fulfilling our will millisecond to millisecond and we praise you and we thank you
[04:29.000 --> 04:35.000]  and we ask you to fulfill us and empower us and lead God and direct us in the fights that we have.
[04:35.000 --> 04:40.000]  We praise you, O great Heavenly Father and the Son you send to the sacrifice Jesus Christ
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  and we just ask you to fulfill us and empower us because we are weak, we are fallen, we are sinners
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  and we cannot defeat the evil without you.
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  You are the answer and we thank you again and ask you to come to our hearts more now and more than ever.
[04:51.000 --> 05:01.000]  So again, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen in FullWars.com tomorrow.
[05:22.000 --> 05:25.000]  Some of these products were selling at below cost.
[05:25.000 --> 05:28.000]  You've got to move them out of the warehouse and be able to continue to stay on the air.
[05:28.000 --> 05:34.000]  So please take action to declare independence from the New World Order by keeping the tip of the spear on air
[05:34.000 --> 05:39.000]  and getting great products at infowarsstore.com.
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  I want to thank you all this July 4th for your continued fight for America
[05:42.000 --> 05:46.000]  and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now because we're so close to winning.
[05:46.000 --> 05:54.000]  In FullWarsStore.com and celebrate July 4th, 1776 Part 2 against the New World Order
[05:54.000 --> 06:20.000]  because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[06:20.000 --> 06:30.000]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[06:30.000 --> 06:37.000]  Celebrating our victory 200 plus years ago against the British tyrant King, King George III.
[06:37.000 --> 06:45.000]  We are honored and blessed to be with you on this Monday, July 4th, 2022 transmission in defiance to the New World Order
[06:45.000 --> 06:50.000]  and everything they've done to try to silence us and muzzle us and shut us down.
[06:50.000 --> 06:57.000]  I salute down to my last cell from the bottom of my will to the top of my consciousness.
[06:57.000 --> 07:01.000]  Thankfulness to all of you for keeping us in the fight.
[07:01.000 --> 07:08.000]  Incredible job to the listeners, the viewers, the crew, the sponsors, the affiliates, everybody.
[07:08.000 --> 07:16.000]  The fact that we're in the fight and the world's awakening is a huge victory and we are blessed to be here today with you.
[07:16.000 --> 07:22.000]  All right, big story up on infowars.com that came out on July 2nd, Saturday, but I want to cover it now.
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000]  U.S. under more tyranny now than in 1776 says historian.
[07:27.000 --> 07:39.000]  The far left, unfortunately, is taking control of the major five megaphones of our nation, meaning the media, entertainment, academia, and of late science and medicine says Douglas MacKinnon.
[07:39.000 --> 07:48.000]  The United States experiencing more tyranny presently than it did during the Revolutionary period in 1776, according to an author, historian Douglas MacKinnon.
[07:48.000 --> 07:50.000]  I read some of his books.
[07:50.000 --> 08:08.000]  In a Fox and Friends interview, Saturday, MacKinnon warned that radical Campos Duffy, that the American true history is no longer being taught in schools, that America is oppressed by more tyranny now than the year it was founded,
[08:08.000 --> 08:17.000]  because of the left stranglehold on inflation, education, and science centers, because the major big banks and the power structure is funding them.
[08:17.000 --> 08:21.000]  They're not the rebels, they are the establishment.
[08:21.000 --> 08:35.000]  As bad as the tyranny was in 1776, in many ways, it's way worse, worse in 2022, because the far left, unfortunately, is taking control of the five major megaphones of our society.
[08:35.000 --> 08:37.000]  I don't need to read more of that to you.
[08:37.000 --> 08:46.000]  We'll play the clip coming up here in just a few minutes, but I explained to you, as I do on a routine basis, and I know you know this deep down, wars cost money.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  And I can't prosecute this war against the New World Order without your support.
[08:51.000 --> 09:03.000]  So I want to ask you on this July 4th, 2022, to re-double your efforts to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast, to pray for our crew, to pray for our host, to pray for our reporters, to pray for me,
[09:03.000 --> 09:10.000]  and to pray for a global awakening, to accelerate which is already happening, and to support us financially.
[09:10.000 --> 09:22.000]  My friends, the enemy's unpopular, and they know it, and they want to try to gaslight us into submission, but I got to tell you, if the general public, and especially a lot of wealthy people in upper-middle-class,
[09:22.000 --> 09:34.000]  Nouveau-Rice that have sat on the bench, realize you're going to lose everything in this inflationary New World Order, and you're going to be targeted under a neo-fascist, global government directing communist policies to the grassroots,
[09:34.000 --> 09:40.000]  if you will simply realize that and awaken to it and say no to it, it's game over.
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  And one of the most important ways to resist it is financially.
[09:43.000 --> 09:51.000]  So we try to sell products at infowarstore.com that enrich your life, your immune system, your libido, and everything else.
[09:51.000 --> 10:00.000]  And the only way you fail is not reaching out and supporting the literal front lines of the fight, the tip of the spear, the heart of the pro-human rebellion against these transhumanists.
[10:00.000 --> 10:13.000]  So we have a July 4th Supercell running, it's the biggest sale of the year, and celebrate 1776 Part 2, celebrate human resistance by spreading the word and going to infowarstore.com.
[10:13.000 --> 10:18.000]  We have double patriot points, and up to 75% off.
[10:18.000 --> 10:25.000]  That means we're losing money on some of these products, but you've got to clear them out of the warehouse to just make payroll and to pay for the massive bandwidth because we're so popular.
[10:25.000 --> 10:31.000]  And to satellite up links and all of the legal bills fighting the Democratic Party, trying to shut us down.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  This is your fight, this is so important.
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  I just want to encourage you to take action today.
[10:36.000 --> 10:37.000]  So many of you have done.
[10:37.000 --> 10:45.000]  I want to thank you for your past support, but encourage you to get products and stock up on them because if they shut us down or implode us or curtail us, maybe the last time you can get these products.
[10:45.000 --> 10:53.000]  So July 4th Supercell starts now at 75% off with double patriot points, 40% off knockout sleep support, out of power, living defense plus.
[10:53.000 --> 11:04.000]  Flushes out the parasites, whole food multivitamin, pollen blocks, survival shield x2, all Dr. Jones naturals, the coral toothpaste, top brain, rocket rest, the activated charcoal toothpaste.
[11:04.000 --> 11:05.000]  It's incredible.
[11:05.000 --> 11:11.000]  50% off on brain force plus the new tropic, the amazing ultra 12, highest quality B12 to boost everything.
[11:11.000 --> 11:12.000]  It's 50% off all of it.
[11:12.000 --> 11:24.000]  Vitamin D3 gummies, ultimate crude oil, lung cleanse, fizzy magnesium, prostagard, open fish oil, vaso beats all 50% off and finally 60% off plus and double patriot points on superfemale vitality.
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  Wow, experience that and iodine surface cleaning spray that's so strong.
[11:28.000 --> 11:35.000]  And finally, save a massive 75% off a double patriot points on hair and beard support formula at infowarstore.com.
[11:35.000 --> 11:43.000]  And that is a super high quality vitamin mineral formula for your body, your immune system that also makes your hair healthier.
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  But we're about to sell out of the multivitamin that is basically the same formula as hair and beard.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  I'm sad to say, I think the hair and beard is a little bit better, a little bit stronger.
[11:52.000 --> 11:55.000]  That's just how it worked out with what supplier we use.
[11:55.000 --> 12:07.000]  So hair and beard below cost 75% off great multivitamin for children, adults, you name it, infowarstore.com or AAA 253 3139.
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  Again, I want to thank you all for keeping us on the air separately.
[12:11.000 --> 12:12.000]  People saying, where's the storeable food?
[12:12.000 --> 12:13.000]  Where's the water filters?
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.000]  Where's the air filters?
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.000]  Where's the preparedness items?
[12:15.000 --> 12:16.000]  They're all at preparetoday.com.
[12:16.000 --> 12:22.000]  So it just goes right through the order already to ship preparetoday.com.
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  Get your storeable food now.
[12:23.000 --> 12:24.000]  Beat inflation.
[12:24.000 --> 12:29.000]  High quality storeable food and hundreds of other items ready to ship at preparetoday.com.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[12:31.000 --> 12:33.000]  Dr. Zelinko's coming up from the grave.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  So many other big interviews on the show live forth.
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  And I want to thank those of you that tuned in on this historic important day.
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  But here, my friends, is the rest of the story.
[12:43.000 --> 12:46.000]  As we celebrate Independence Day from West Point,
[12:46.000 --> 12:51.000]  our next guest is sounding the alarm on the far left's attempt to cancel our nation's birthday.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  Our founding fathers and the American flag.
[12:54.000 --> 13:01.000]  He is the author of the 56 Liberty Lessons from those who risked all to sign the Declaration of Independence.
[13:01.000 --> 13:06.000]  And he joined my podcast from the kitchen table not too long ago to talk all about it.
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  If you haven't seen it, you can go back, catch that episode.
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.000]  It's fascinating.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  Douglas McKinnon joins us now.
[13:12.000 --> 13:17.000]  Douglas, so grateful to have you here on Fox and Friends, not just on our podcast.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  So tell me why you wrote this book.
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  Let our viewers know that.
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  So Rachel, just last July 3rd, I wasn't even thinking about writing the book.
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  And then on the 4th of July of last year, I did a little bit of a video tour
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  through some of the more liberal news sites out there.
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.000]  And on site after site, I saw guest after guest on the left calling for not only the cancellation of the 4th of July,
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  but the cancellation of our founding fathers and the American flag.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  And I decided at that point, I called my publisher.
[13:42.000 --> 13:46.000]  I said, if we don't put out a book, if we don't defend these men, if we don't defend that time,
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  if we don't defend the genius of the founding fathers,
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  we're going to lose our chance to do so.
[13:51.000 --> 13:53.000]  I couldn't agree with you more of your kids.
[13:53.000 --> 13:58.000]  By the way, it's a great book to have in your family home, to give to graduates,
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  to give to any of your kids, because some of us know the big names in the book.
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  But there's 56 signers here.
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  And when they signed this, they were basically risking their lives.
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  It was an act of treason.
[14:09.000 --> 14:10.000]  Well, they were.
[14:10.000 --> 14:13.000]  Matter of fact, each and every one of them knew they were signing their own death warrant
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  when they signed the Declaration of Independence.
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  And guess what? So many of them were arrested, had their homes burned to the ground,
[14:19.000 --> 14:23.000]  had their wives arrested, their wives in prison, their wives sexually abused,
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  their livestock slaughtered.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  And again, this is the price they paid to create the greatest nation on the face of the earth.
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  And they don't teach this in our schools anymore, Rachel.
[14:32.000 --> 14:38.000]  American children do not learn that these were the heroes that created the greatest nation on the face of the earth.
[14:38.000 --> 14:44.000]  Yeah, I mean, many kids are thinking that this period of time was something to be ashamed of.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  Quite the opposite.
[14:45.000 --> 14:50.000]  Tell me what we can learn in this moment in time right now that we're in,
[14:50.000 --> 14:52.000]  because a lot of our viewers are concerned about this moment in time.
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  What can we learn from these founders, from the people who signed the Declaration of Independence?
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  What are the lessons encouraged that we should learn?
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  Well, I talked about it in the book too, because again, as bad as the tyranny was in 1776,
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  in many ways, as I say, it's worse now in 2022,
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  because the far left unfortunately has taken control over the five major megaphones of our nation,
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  media, entertainment, academia, and of late science and medicine.
[15:14.000 --> 15:16.000]  And what these 56 men would tell us,
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  in lesson until they imprison us, in lesson until they take our lives,
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  we have our voices, they cannot silence us.
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  We have to speak to the greatness of this country.
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  We have to talk to each other about why these values are so important,
[15:28.000 --> 15:31.000]  why the rule of law are so important, and why our history is so important.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  If our history is bad, let us condemn it and learn from it.
[15:34.000 --> 15:37.000]  If it's good, let us praise it and build upon it,
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  but let us never, ever cancel our shared American history.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  Douglas, your book could not be more timely.
[15:43.000 --> 15:46.000]  It is a moment for courage, and we can take a lot of inspiration
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  from those who signed the Declaration of Independence.
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  He goes through every single one of the 56 and tells you a little bit about them.

[17:22.000 --> 17:23.000]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.000]  InfoWarsTour.com, by the way, the products he mentions,
[17:26.000 --> 17:28.000]  InfoWarsTour.com is where to get them, folks,
[17:28.000 --> 17:30.000]  and we do have the best supplements.
[17:30.000 --> 17:35.000]  I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information,
[17:35.000 --> 17:39.000]  we do the best with our supplements as well.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  I mean, look at the Hair and Beard Support Formula.
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  Folks, this is a joke.
[17:43.000 --> 17:44.000]  I mean, we're giving this thing away.
[17:44.000 --> 17:45.000]  It's 75% off.
[17:45.000 --> 17:47.000]  By the way, it works for me.
[17:47.000 --> 17:52.000]  In case you haven't noticed, the Hair and Beard Formula is working for me.
[17:52.000 --> 17:54.000]  Quite well, I might add.
[17:54.000 --> 17:58.000]  Quite well, my barber appreciates Hair and Beard Support for men.
[17:58.000 --> 18:00.000]  I go and see them quite often now.
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.000]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas,
[18:03.000 --> 18:06.000]  or whether you're a farmer, a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer, or a millionaire.
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.000]  Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these profiles.
[18:10.000 --> 18:11.000]  You see it every year.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  30 different tax returns, 30 different answers.
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  50 different tax returns, 50 different answers.
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.000]  And almost all of them just screw you over,
[18:19.000 --> 18:21.000]  especially the big firms and the big tax groups,
[18:21.000 --> 18:24.000]  because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public
[18:24.000 --> 18:26.000]  understanding this and knowing this show.
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.000]  It's a very important situation with inflation
[18:29.000 --> 18:31.000]  and all the things out there hurting everybody.
[18:31.000 --> 18:36.000]  To be able to do things tax-wise, it's legal and lawful
[18:36.000 --> 18:37.000]  that allows you to keep more of your money.
[18:37.000 --> 18:42.000]  We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax advice in the last few years.
[18:42.000 --> 18:46.000]  The only way you fail is not writing down the URL,
[18:46.000 --> 18:53.000]  JonesTaxRelief.com, one word, JonesTaxRelief.com, or call 833-904-285.
[18:53.000 --> 19:18.000]  833-904-285.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  It's one of the many academics that look into,
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  say, the Anglo-American establishment,
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  the founder of the Bilderberg Group,
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  the trilateral commission of the United Nations,
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  the whole project of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
[19:34.000 --> 19:36.000]  Until 10 years ago, the media said
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  the controlled corporate media of the Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  Well, now the Bilderberg Group is public in its former head,
[19:43.000 --> 19:46.000]  still on the steering committee, is Klaus Schwab,
[19:46.000 --> 19:49.000]  and he has set up the great reset in global government.
[19:49.000 --> 19:51.000]  And as a Liberty Movement worldwide,
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  we don't address the globalist head-on.
[19:53.000 --> 19:57.000]  About the second thing are worldwide authoritarian corporate takeover.
[19:57.000 --> 19:58.000]  We don't have a shot.
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  If you expose them, we can beat them easily.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[20:05.000 --> 20:11.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[20:11.000 --> 20:18.000]  So the globalists have always,
[20:18.000 --> 20:21.000]  in the last 200 years of their rule of Europe,
[20:21.000 --> 20:26.000]  expanding into the U.S. and now worldwide in this mass risk game,
[20:26.000 --> 20:30.000]  the power elite have always, at the end of their life,
[20:30.000 --> 20:35.000]  had one obsession, not wanting to give it all up.
[20:35.000 --> 20:37.000]  But they had their generational institutions.
[20:37.000 --> 20:41.000]  The New World Order is a corrupt, organized crime university.
[20:41.000 --> 20:43.000]  They teach the system and it continues,
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  and they have their idols, their forefathers and mothers,
[20:46.000 --> 20:51.000]  and it just continues as they refine the science of the power
[20:51.000 --> 20:56.000]  and control and dehumanization, which is their pleasure.
[20:56.000 --> 21:01.000]  They've never wanted to turn loose of life.
[21:01.000 --> 21:04.000]  Do any of us want to turn loose of life?
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  Sure, when we get old enough and enough pain,
[21:06.000 --> 21:10.000]  it's easier and we can let go.
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.000]  And so many ancient cultures, the elites engaged in all this bizarre,
[21:14.000 --> 21:17.000]  abusive behaviors, believing on their people,
[21:17.000 --> 21:20.000]  believing that would give them longer life.
[21:20.000 --> 21:25.000]  Only because the priests clashed, you had to manipulate them.
[21:25.000 --> 21:33.000]  The magicians, the con artists, the scam men of the day.
[21:33.000 --> 21:42.000]  And so now, here in 2002, for the first time in human recorded history,
[21:42.000 --> 21:55.000]  eternal life is now actually possible for the forces of the New World Order.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  So when you ask, why would the globalists say,
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  and they've said it on the record a thousand times,
[22:01.000 --> 22:08.000]  that they want to get rid of 80% of us and reduce mass plagues to do it.
[22:08.000 --> 22:12.000]  When they propose this and prepare this and produce it
[22:12.000 --> 22:15.000]  in their labyrinthine underground facilities in Fort Dietrich
[22:15.000 --> 22:20.000]  and Portendown in Wiltshire, England and Bragg, they have it
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  and prepare us for the attacks.
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  Very excuse and they've actually said it.
[22:26.000 --> 22:31.000]  You read their policy papers, they start talking about this,
[22:31.000 --> 22:36.000]  about how they need a 500 million technician, scientist, worker class,
[22:36.000 --> 22:43.000]  different stratas therein, to serve several hundred families.
[22:43.000 --> 22:50.000]  And these creatures, these globalists are going to get the new tissue regeneration,
[22:50.000 --> 22:56.000]  the brain grafts, the nanotechnology revolution, the cybernetic interfaces.
[22:56.000 --> 22:57.000]  They're going to get it all.
[22:57.000 --> 23:03.000]  I mean, already the technology we see is 30 years suppressed.
[23:03.000 --> 23:07.000]  I mean, they're on a mad power trip now.
[23:07.000 --> 23:13.000]  And they're laying this intricate, cashless society control grid
[23:13.000 --> 23:19.000]  and easing us into it and selling it to us
[23:19.000 --> 23:22.000]  and hurting us off the rural areas, into the cities,
[23:22.000 --> 23:31.000]  the name of environmentalism and security.
[23:31.000 --> 23:34.000]  And once they have us in the compact cities,
[23:34.000 --> 23:43.000]  there will be a ratcheting up of biological attacks.
[23:43.000 --> 23:52.000]  When you watch 100 million people die of genetically engineered
[23:52.000 --> 23:57.000]  super smallpox and anthrax
[23:57.000 --> 24:02.000]  and the stuff they haven't even released in India,
[24:02.000 --> 24:08.000]  when you watch it released in China, when you see it hit Africa,
[24:08.000 --> 24:14.000]  when you see it hit Latin America, remember Alex Jones warning you.
[24:14.000 --> 24:21.000]  There may still be a chance at that point to remember this emergency warning
[24:21.000 --> 24:31.000]  from time to you, remember.
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  Remember the cynical smile and the laugh.
[24:36.000 --> 24:45.000]  Remember you didn't heed the warning long after I'm gone.
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.000]  As we watch a mass cull after several ratchetings
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  we're going to see in the next decade as the tariff events get larger,
[24:52.000 --> 24:57.000]  then as they hit what we think is the mass cull,
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  then it will go to the microchipped population,
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  the face scan to leave your house, to get in your car,
[25:04.000 --> 25:09.000]  to the borders with giant walls stretching up towards the sky,
[25:09.000 --> 25:13.000]  helicopters everywhere, in the name of security,
[25:13.000 --> 25:19.000]  in the name of keeping the great death out of the United States.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  Our government will be nuking foreign countries,
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  there will be wholesale mass murder,
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.000]  and you will be so afraid during this period
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  you will be cheering at mass rallies in sports stadiums,
[25:31.000 --> 25:39.000]  cheering on your imperial world leader.
[25:39.000 --> 25:43.000]  And then after the rest of the population has been basically wiped out
[25:43.000 --> 25:46.000]  with small enclaves hiding in caves around the world,
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  they're going to cull this country.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  And there would have been some large cullings before that
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.000]  in the hundreds of thousands.
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  Again, I have documents, I have evidence, I have news stories,
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  I have global statements, and I have understanding of their program,
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  and I see the grid like a map in intricate detail
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  laid out with exactly what they're going to do.
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.000]  All we don't understand is their precise time frame.
[26:12.000 --> 26:19.000]  All I know is it's moving very quickly and it is of great concern.
[26:19.000 --> 26:26.000]  Their delusional rationale is that after the mass culling,
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  if you talk to Ted Turner or Prince Phillip
[26:28.000 --> 26:33.000]  or any of these globalists that have put this on the record,
[26:33.000 --> 26:38.000]  their rationale is that after they've gotten rid of 80% of us
[26:38.000 --> 26:41.000]  and their documents show the only groups they're going to allow to live
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.000]  are Caucasians and some groups of Asians.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  These people make the Nazis look like a tea party.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  Everybody's starting to talk about the extermination plan.
[26:53.000 --> 26:56.000]  You know, the globalists engineered World War I, World War II,
[26:56.000 --> 26:59.000]  and the rest of it, they put Hitler and Stalin in power now.
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  They killed 200 million-plus people last century,
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  and they're not playing games.
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  It's their pleasure. They're completely ruthless.
[27:08.000 --> 27:12.000]  And now they've got this great prize of life extension,
[27:12.000 --> 27:15.000]  but they're having to suppress all this technology
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  and it's getting harder and harder for them,
[27:17.000 --> 27:20.000]  and other third-world countries are starting to develop some of it
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  and make their own discoveries.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  And so they're in a race to keep it all for themselves,
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  and they've got, they're going to do it pretty soon.
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  Like, it's hard to explain.
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  I feel like I'm more hydrated. I'm a roofer.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  It normally takes a lot of water to stay hydrated for me.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  It feels like I'm retaining water better.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  Like I said, I started dreaming again.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  I haven't had a dream in 15 years,
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  and two weeks after taking it,
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  I was starting to dream every single night.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  Well, this isn't some new age thing.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  They just piggyback on it.
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.000]  The pineal gland gets filled with fluoride,
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  and that's the third eye.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  Literally, it's connected to higher dreaming,
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  higher consciousness medically,
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  and then obviously the ancients said spiritual connection.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  And when it gets filled with fluoride, and bromide,
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  and bromine, and all the bad allergens,
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  then people don't dream,
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  and they don't have higher consciousness statistically.
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  But real iodine goes through and just burns all that out.
[28:40.000 --> 28:42.000]  It doesn't just get in there.
[28:42.000 --> 28:44.000]  It removes the bad stuff in the major studies.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  That's why everybody should get X2.
[28:46.000 --> 28:48.000]  We have a limited supply of it at infowarstore.com.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  It is, ladies and gentlemen,
[28:50.000 --> 28:52.000]  40% off right now, though it's about to sell out.
[28:52.000 --> 28:55.000]  Here, X2 at infowarstore.com. It's about 15 days to kick in.
[28:55.000 --> 29:24.000]  infowarstore.com, X2.
[29:25.000 --> 29:30.000]  So please take action to declare independence
[29:30.000 --> 29:33.000]  from the New World Order by keeping the tip of the spear on air
[29:33.000 --> 29:38.000]  and getting great products at infowarstore.com.
[29:38.000 --> 29:40.000]  I want to thank you all this July 4th
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  for your continued fight for America,
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  and I would encourage you to join the fight even harder now
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  because we're so close to winning.
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.000]  infowarstore.com and celebrate July 4th, 1776,
[29:51.000 --> 29:53.000]  Part 2 against the New World Order,
[29:53.000 --> 29:59.000]  because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[29:59.000 --> 30:01.000]  The globalists are making their move.
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  Their great reset is here.
[30:03.000 --> 30:05.000]  They're coming for your children.
[30:05.000 --> 30:07.000]  They're coming for the value of your currency.
[30:07.000 --> 30:09.000]  They're coming for your national sovereignty.
[30:09.000 --> 30:11.000]  They're coming for your very bodies
[30:11.000 --> 30:14.000]  with their biomedical tyranny.
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  They're coming for your free speech.
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  They're coming for your privacy.
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  And, ladies and gentlemen,
[30:20.000 --> 30:22.000]  they're coming for your right to vote
[30:22.000 --> 30:24.000]  and have your representative in government
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  that you and your fellow Americans choose.
[30:26.000 --> 30:28.000]  The new film, the seminal film,
[30:28.000 --> 30:31.000]  the most important documentary ever made in my view,
[30:31.000 --> 30:35.000]  2000 Mules, is now available on DVD with expanded extras
[30:35.000 --> 30:39.000]  at infowarstore.com.

[30:53.000 --> 30:56.000]  this film can stop them if you take action.

[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  2000 Mules.
[31:00.000 --> 31:03.000]  Dinesh D'Souza's new film, 2000 Mules,
[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  is the most important documentary in modern times
[31:05.000 --> 31:07.000]  because it proves how the deep state
[31:07.000 --> 31:09.000]  stole the 2020 election
[31:09.000 --> 31:11.000]  and how they're planning to steal future elections
[31:11.000 --> 31:14.000]  and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[31:14.000 --> 31:15.000]  Now, it's great that it's online.
[31:15.000 --> 31:17.000]  It's great that millions watch it online.

[31:41.000 --> 31:43.000]  and of course part one, part two,
[31:43.000 --> 31:45.000]  and now the new part three of COVID land.

[32:00.000 --> 32:01.000]  Look at that.
[32:01.000 --> 32:03.000]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear
[32:03.000 --> 32:05.000]  and that's because it's been denatured.
[32:05.000 --> 32:06.000]  It's been marked down.
[32:06.000 --> 32:08.000]  We didn't do that.
[32:08.000 --> 32:10.000]  You think I would metaphysically
[32:10.000 --> 32:13.000]  tell you something that this is the very best I can get?
[32:13.000 --> 32:15.000]  I'd rather go to hell and do that.
[32:15.000 --> 32:18.000]  I will only give you the maximum best info,
[32:18.000 --> 32:20.000]  the maximum truth, the maximum product
[32:20.000 --> 32:24.000]  because I want that good will.
[32:24.000 --> 32:26.000]  What I do to you, I do to myself.
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.000]  Don't you get the big secret?
[32:28.000 --> 32:30.000]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[32:30.000 --> 32:32.000]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[32:32.000 --> 32:37.000]  And this little jewel right here is solid,
[32:37.000 --> 32:42.000]  liquid consciousness.
[32:42.000 --> 32:46.000]  Look it up, find out
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  how even the FDA and the government
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.000]  admits fish oil is incredible.
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.000]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves
[32:52.000 --> 32:55.000]  is take good fish oil or krill oil
[32:55.000 --> 32:57.000]  just like our information is dynamite
[32:57.000 --> 33:12.000]  or our products in 4store.com.
[33:27.000 --> 33:38.000]  We do know that there's compelling evidence
[33:38.000 --> 33:40.000]  that the law enforcement response
[33:40.000 --> 33:42.000]  to the attack at Rob Elementary
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  was an abject failure and antithetical
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  to everything we've learned over the last two decades
[33:48.000 --> 33:53.000]  since the Columbine massacre.
[33:53.000 --> 33:56.000]  Three minutes after the subject entered the West Building,
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  there was sufficient number of armed officers
[33:58.000 --> 34:00.000]  wearing body armor
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.000]  to isolate, distract, and neutralize the subject.
[34:05.000 --> 34:08.000]  The only thing stopping a hallway of dedicated officers
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  from any room 111 and 112
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  was the on-scene commander
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  who decided to place the lives of officers
[34:15.000 --> 34:20.000]  before the lives of children.
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  The officers had weapons, the children had none.
[34:23.000 --> 34:26.000]  The officers had body armor, the children had none.
[34:26.000 --> 34:33.000]  The officers had training, the subject had none.
[34:33.000 --> 34:37.000]  One error, 14 minutes and 8 seconds.
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  That's how long the children waited
[34:39.000 --> 34:42.000]  and the teachers waited in rooms 111
[34:42.000 --> 34:45.000]  to be rescued.
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  And while they waited, the on-seat commander
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  waited for radio and rifles.
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  Then he waited for shields.
[34:54.000 --> 34:57.000]  Then he waited for SWAT.
[34:57.000 --> 35:01.000]  Lastly, he waited for a key that was never needed.
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  The post-collab mine doctrine
[35:04.000 --> 35:07.000]  is clear and compelling and unambiguous.
[35:07.000 --> 35:10.000]  Stop the killing, stop the dying.
[35:10.000 --> 35:12.000]  That's the head of the Texas State Police,
[35:12.000 --> 35:15.000]  Steve McGraw, testifying
[35:15.000 --> 35:18.000]  to the legislature on what's happening.
[35:18.000 --> 35:20.000]  And I'm going to get into this war next hour,
[35:20.000 --> 35:22.000]  bringing up Drew Hernandez,
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.000]  because he has reported extensively in the war zone
[35:25.000 --> 35:28.000]  that is the Texas and Arizona borders particularly
[35:28.000 --> 35:30.000]  in depth for us for years.
[35:30.000 --> 35:32.000]  We've been down there with him many times.
[35:32.000 --> 35:34.000]  And this is the subject I want to raise here.
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.000]  I don't want to just harp, like I normally do,
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  on how demonic the pro-abortion people are,
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  how they hate babies, or how they say they love Satan.
[35:41.000 --> 35:44.000]  That's important, but not the key.
[35:44.000 --> 35:46.000]  I don't want to just talk about, oh, look,
[35:46.000 --> 35:48.000]  another 50 dead illegals locked up to die
[35:48.000 --> 35:51.000]  in a tractor trailer, another week goes by,
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  and another tragedy.
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  It's all interconnected.
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  We hear a lot about white privilege in this country,
[35:58.000 --> 36:01.000]  which is a made-up Marxist term
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  to turn us all against each other.
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  But I'll tell you where there is privilege.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  If you can make it out of your mother's womb,
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  you get more rights, and you have the privilege
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  of not being killed, and it being against the law.
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  And if you had a tractor trailer of citizens,
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.000]  whether they were Hispanic, black, white, Asian,
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.000]  and if, say, in Wisconsin, they found a tractor trailer
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  full of 50 black people dead,
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  or 50 Hispanic citizens dead,
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  or 50 white people dead, or a mix of people,
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  it would be the end of the world,
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  and we know everything about it,
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  and who locked them in there,
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  who helped their families ransom for money.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  But because it's illegal aliens,
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  a permanent underclass, migrants,
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  being brought in by the Codes,
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  and the money being laundered by the Democratic Party,
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  with the broken border by design,
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  they're not human, ladies and gentlemen,
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.000]  according to the very people that are using them
[36:50.000 --> 36:53.000]  and letting them use children as a free ticket
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  into this country, in many cases,
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  that aren't any relation to them.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  So I'm going to play this clip and go to Drew Hernandez
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  for the balance of the hour,
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  but this clip's from making the rounds this week.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  Joe Rogan sent it to me this weekend.
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  I meant to get to it.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  Now it's viral, now it's everywhere.
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  It's Mike Judge's new BBC Butthead movie.
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  I haven't seen it yet, but I've seen this clip.
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  A white privilege.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  And Bebas and Butthead are obviously total morons.
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  And they got accused of about 75,
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  these fictional characters
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  that my friend Mike Judge created decades ago,
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  30-something years ago.
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  And they're told by the professor,
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  you have privilege because you're white.
[37:34.000 --> 37:36.000]  You can commit crimes, you can do whatever you want.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  Of course, that's not true.
[37:38.000 --> 37:41.000]  National statistics show that police are twice as likely
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  per capita,
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  per 1,000 whites, 1,000 blacks,
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  twice as likely to shoot whites.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  Why is that? Are they out to kill whites? No.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  They know that if they make a mistake,
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  particularly in a black home,
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  they'll be crucified and fired and probably put in prison.
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  Or they go to a domestic dispute or a shootout.
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  So they slow roll.
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  And then you have the highest crime rates in the black area
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  because they can't carry out law enforcement.
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  That's the main cause.
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  So again, yeah, there's white privilege.
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  You're twice as likely to be shot by police,
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  but not because they're hunting white people
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  because they actually respond,
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  which is a form of discrimination,
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  but only because they get discriminated against
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  and are scared to go into the black areas.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  So that's the reality here
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  of the white privilege,
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  is it's a mixed bag, ladies and gentlemen.
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  And it's 10 to 1 black on white crime
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  because there are some racist black people
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  that think white people deserve to be robbed and killed
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  just because they're white.
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  And the left promotes that.
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  So that's the reality of the white privilege.
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  There's privilege if you're a citizen
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  and you live in this country and you get found dead,
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  the media will cover it,
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  but they don't want it covered
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  because they are busting the border
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  and smuggling millions of people in.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  And so if you're one of these new permanent underclass
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  being brought in by the Democratic Party,
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  you aren't treated as human.
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  And that's the real Democratic Party privilege.
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  They have armed guards.
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  They have police.
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  They don't want citizens to have them, no matter what color you are.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  There's elite privilege,
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  the Bilderberg group, Davos group,
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  World Economic Forum group, privilege,
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  and then there's all the rest of us
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  being turned against each other and played off.
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  But here is the BBC Budhead piece.
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  This is a classic example
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  of white privilege.
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  And you both have it.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  Uh, what's that?
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  Anyone want to fill them in?
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  Um, yeah, I'll do it.
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  Okay, so white privilege is when white people,
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  particularly men, automatically assume
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  they can take whatever they want.
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  They never have to worry about getting stopped by the police.
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  And they have the inside track
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  for any job they...
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  I've got this one, Aisha.
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  They have the inside track for any job they want.
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  Exactly, Gage.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  Thank you for that.
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  That's white privilege.
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  Whoa, and we have that?
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  You sure do.
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  I see.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  Whoa, I never realized this stuff.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  Yeah, you've really opened up my eyes.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  Well, I'm glad we've been able to enlighten you.
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  The real question is,
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  do you think you'll be acting differently
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  from now on?
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  Uh, I guarantee it.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, me too, yeah.
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  Epicide, please.
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  We have white privilege.
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, check it out.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  Here.
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  Don't worry, it's okay.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  We automatically assume we can take what we want
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  and we don't have to worry about the police.
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  It's okay, you didn't know.
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  Men, neither.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  Stop now.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  This is what we were taught, sir.
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  We're subverting existing paradigms.
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  This rules.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  I never thought I'd say this, but I'm glad we went to college.
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  Yeah, it's like, now I have the skills
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  for today's workplace.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  Well, let's see.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  What should we take next?
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  Let's take that car.
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  Um, but that's a police car.
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  Beavis, you dumbass.
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  Didn't you hear?
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  We don't have to worry about getting stopped by the police.
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  Oh, yeah.
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  Okay, Beavis, let's tear ass.
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  Yeah, cool.
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  Don't move.
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  Uh, sir, maybe you didn't know,
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  but we have white privilege.
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  Get your hands where I can see them.
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  I think the problem is you're just uneducated.
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  Yeah, we're going to get jobs on Wall Street.
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  Drew Hernandez will be with us a little bit
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  in the next hour. I appreciate him joining us.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  Drew, I know we're going to be getting into
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  so many of the big topics out there,
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  but what's your overall view on the point
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  I just made about there's the elitist privilege
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  and then there's the rest of us.
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  Nancy Pelosi's husband,
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  they won't release the squad car footage,
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  the body cams.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  You got to run over somebody reportedly,
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  but because he is married to Nancy Pelosi,
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  that story's being killed.
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  Well, Alex, thanks for having me
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  and shout out to the info warrior getter chat
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  right now. I'm in the chat and they just,
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  they love you, Alex, and they love what you're doing
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  and just want to encourage you.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  There's millions of people out there that love you guys,
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  but to go to your point,
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  the Democrats have always been racist.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  You and I both know this.
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  They're the pro-save slavery party.
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  They're the anti-civil rights movement party.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  They are the ones that have always wanted
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  to oppose minorities.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  So right now it makes sense to me
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  that they're literally engineering racism
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  in our universities,
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  in Hollywood, across the board
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  in corporate America, where they,
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  the ones are pushing the racism.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  And it's always these racist white liberals
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  that turn around and tell someone like me,
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  I'll use their terminology,
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  a person of color that I'm oppressed
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  and I'm poor and I can't do anything on my own
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  and I should just listen to them.
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  And even when I'm on the street with people like Savannah
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  on the Hernandez, Savannah Hernandez trying to report,
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  it's always these white liberals that are telling us
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  and people not to talk to us.
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  So they're the real racist, Alex.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  They always have been and they always will be.
[42:55.000 --> 42:57.000]  That's right. They're the self-appointed gods
[42:57.000 --> 42:59.000]  over to Saul and we're sick of it.
[42:59.000 --> 43:01.000]  Hernandez, stay there. We'll be right back.

[43:59.000 --> 44:01.000]  while you're there.
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  If I had to describe
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.000]  with just one word,
[44:05.000 --> 44:07.000]  the brainwashing,
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  the mind control,
[44:09.000 --> 44:11.000]  the asleep prince
[44:11.000 --> 44:13.000]  that the general public is in,
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  the best word would actually be
[44:15.000 --> 44:17.000]  the people are lost.
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  Just like you're lost to sleep
[44:19.000 --> 44:21.000]  or lost in a bad nightmare
[44:21.000 --> 44:23.000]  or you're in a horror you get knocked out
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  and you've lost
[44:25.000 --> 44:27.000]  your bearings because
[44:27.000 --> 44:29.000]  you are totally
[44:29.000 --> 44:31.000]  dizzy and confused. You have a concussion.
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  And that's what the globalists have done.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  They have stunned us.
[44:35.000 --> 44:37.000]  They have put us into a position
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  of not knowing our bearings.
[44:39.000 --> 44:41.000]  And then Klaus Schwab recently came out and gave a speech
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  called The Great New Narrative
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  where he brags how the public is lost.
[44:45.000 --> 44:47.000]  How the culture in the media
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  has been driven to make sure the people are all alone
[44:49.000 --> 44:51.000]  so they can now guide humanity
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  over the edge of a cliff.
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  That's what the great reset is.
[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  They need darkness to thrive. The light lives
[44:57.000 --> 45:13.000]  at n4wars.com.
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  This is a new product.

[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  which is loaded with energy compounds
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  and antioxidants that have been used
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  by Amazonian tribes for centuries.
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  Alpha GPC, a natural
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  compound found in the brain
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  that delivers an essential nutrient,

[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  stole the 2020 election
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  and how they're planning to steal future elections
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  and complete our journey to basically being like
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  Venezuela. Now it's great that it's online

[47:23.000 --> 47:25.000]  Well the last 3 years
[47:25.000 --> 47:27.000]  Drieger Nandes has exploded on the scene
[47:27.000 --> 47:29.000]  as one of the most trepid fearless reporters
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  covering Antifa
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  Riots, the border
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  you name it. He's a good friend of mine now
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  we've gone on the road quite a bit together
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  he also teams up with Savannah Hernandez
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  and they're just really kicking ass
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  he works with Turning Point USA
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  she works with Truth Social and they also work
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  with Info Wars and
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  the live feed they shot
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  they were with us Saturday for 2 hours
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  has gone viral
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  and tens of millions of people have seen different clips
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  from those 2 hours
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  that is success
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  and the reason I report that to viewers and listeners
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  is you need to know Info Wars
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  and Drieger Nandes and all the people we work with
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  are fighting hard
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  and putting ourselves in the line to expose this evil
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  and we appreciate your support and your word of mouth
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  but it's you
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  sharing the articles from his Twitter
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  and sharing the videos from Bandat Video
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  and his videos that is getting it through the censors
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  and really showing the ugly face of the New World Order
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  so I want to get into Roe v Wade
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  and I want to get into the border
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  that you just returned from a few weeks ago
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  that you were telling me on air and off air
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  is just worse than ever than we were even down there
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  a few months ago
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  so I want to hit all that but you're a really articulate guy
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  and I respect your world view
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  what would you call this period we're in right now
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  and with 133 days out from the election
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  with everybody turning against the left
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  the Democrats what do you expect them to pull
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  to try to salvage themselves
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  big picture what is Drieger Nandes telling us
[48:49.000 --> 48:51.000]  wife and family
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  so what do you really think is about to happen
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  because I have a sense of optimism
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  people are waking up
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  and humanity is finding its soul again
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  but also I feel a lot of real anxiety
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  knowing the enemy has got a lot of tricks up their sleeves
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  Well, number one Alex
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  from a biblical perspective
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  I'll give you that first
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  I think right now we're living in a generation
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  and an era and a time frame
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  right now in the timeline and God's universe
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  and God's creation where
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  we have total depravity
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  we've seen this in cycles
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  we've seen it in Rome and in Corinth
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  if you study biblical history as well
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  we have seen superpowers
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  go through total depravity
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  and a societal reprobate mind
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  now what that means from a biblical perspective
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  is God gives over
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  societies to a reprobate
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  and a depraved mind
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  what that means is
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  someone loses their moral compass
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  they lose all sanity
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  and that is a consequence
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  that is a judgment according to Romans chapter 1
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  based off of a society
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  suppressing the truth of God himself
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  so as a default you get
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  total depravity, total lawlessness
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  zero morality, all void of morality
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  and some of the distinct
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  I guess we can call marks
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  of that society when you read Romans chapter 1
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  is a total disrespect
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  of society against one another
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  liars, cheaters, backstabbers
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  murderers, the list goes on
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  but then it turns into open
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  normalized homosexuality
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  and then total confusion
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  if anyone's questioning what I'm saying
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  just go read Romans chapter 1 for yourself
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  and it's literally like you're watching
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  info wars in real time
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  why? because we're covering this
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  as it's happening in real time
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  and the Bible told us that all this was going to take place
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  so the good news is
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  the gospel is always alive
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  and it's always well and it's always going to have
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  the power to save anybody
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  on the verge of dying and going straight to hell
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  now
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  does that mean that that's going to happen?
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  are we going to see a mass revival?
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  are we going to see just a mass collapse
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  of the United States of America? we saw that in Rome
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  they disperse, they're not lasting forever
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  and we can't sit here and think America can last forever
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  as well because God is always on the throne
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  and at the end of the day
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  he's going to do what he wants to do
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  he's going to judge America
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  when he is going to judge America
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  and right now I will say this
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  and the collapse of it and the pushback
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  and the justices having the courage
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  to strike it down
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  we know it's going to go back down to the states
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  but Alex you and I both know
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  that that is a glimpse of hope, that is a ray of light
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  a lot of people are seeing
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  that there is hope in this country
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  I think that is the momentum
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  I was talking about this with Owen on the war room
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  the day that it broke and I told him
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  this is the momentum that we need moving forward
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  I think the justices
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  that have the courage to do this
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  they set the tone, they set the energy
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  they set the momentum for other Americans
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  and pro-life just patriotic
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  pro-human individuals
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  in the United States of America and worldwide
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  to continue with this momentum
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  pushing forward whether you're in the world of
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  education, entertainment, news
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  media, wherever it is
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  or if you're just a loving
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  responsible mother or father
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  at home and you're watching everything that's unfolding
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  this is the momentum we needed
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  we cannot let this stop
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  we cannot let these people continue to threaten us
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  we cannot let these people continue to intimidate us
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  because if we do, that is how we lose
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  and I'm not calling for violence
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  we can legislatively continue to push back
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  and I think the Supreme Court set that example
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  very clearly and we cannot let this momentum
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  fade away Alex, you and I both know that
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  beautifully eloquent
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  and we should talk about your story
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  because it's really for people to be able to
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  think about what their destiny could be
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  you're a super articulate guy
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  I mean the first time I ever saw you
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  you were in the reveries of us and this guy is a natural
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  and now you're very prominent
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  you're reaching millions of people a day
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  what were you doing before
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  because I know you told me this before, I forget the whole story
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  God convicted your heart to get involved
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  you remind me, I know that you told me the story
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  but what got you in the game
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  I know there's so many people out there
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  that are just as smart as I am or smarter
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  like you who are on the fence
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  or on the
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  sideline, something makes you get in the game
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  and I know there's people out there
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  of every race, color and creed watching
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  that could do just as great of things
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  as I've done or you've done or others have done
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  but they haven't taken that step
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  and that's what I'm all about is getting people
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  to take that step
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  and that's one of my things I'm most proud of
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  is that so many proud people say
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  hey you got me involved, you got me to take action
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  I think that's really info war's greatest contribution
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  is getting people to take action
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  but what was your awakening like
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  or were you already awake, what happened?
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  Well, number one Alex
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  came a born again Christian
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  on February 1st, 2012
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  Christ radically changed my heart, my mind
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  my spirit opened up my eyes
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  to what the world is really
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  doing and how the world is really functioning
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  on a spiritual level, there is evil
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  there is a real devil just as
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  God is real but God is more powerful
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  opening up my eyes to the spiritual
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  aspects of things and then being able
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  to take a look at the worlds from a biblical
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  world view, everything begins to
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  stabilize and make sense but
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  I didn't start getting fully politically
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  engaged until
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  after the election of Donald Trump
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  and the reason why is because
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  all of the wiki leaks that came out
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  all of the intel drops, even info wars
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  was putting stuff out, hearing that Hillary
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  Clinton was essentially going to do
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  what President Puppet Biden
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  is doing right now, open borders
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  collapsing the economy
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  just putting Americans in a place
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  where they are controllable and nasty
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  stabilization, all these things were coming out
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  and I saw
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  all the lies that were taking place during the
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  2016 election where they would call Trump
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  a racist and a liar, a hater of Mexicans
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  and brown people
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  on CNN, I would watch that and then at night
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  by day I would watch that
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  and then by night I would go watch Trump's
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  rallies and listen to his message
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  never heard a single thing
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  about hating brown people or
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  any racist rhetoric, it was always pro-America
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  pro-life, pro-individual
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  pro-Americana, pro-patriotic
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  pro-unification, he was trying to unify
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  pro-America
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  unification but
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  seeing that we almost came on the
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  verge of losing the country
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  in 2016, kind of like where we are
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  right now, like I said
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  that's what really engaged me as a born-again
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  Christian because, number one, I know
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  that I have the power of the Holy Spirit
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  I have the power of the Word of God
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  he lives in me, he literally works
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  through me, he does all that he can
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  through me if I'm just submissive and obedient
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  I'm not perfect, I'll never claim to be
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  that only Christ is, but I
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  knew that if something could
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  change and God could use me to
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  do something that now was definitely the
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  time, I mean it's always the time
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  but for me, I just saw
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  that our country is on the verge
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  of something very evil
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  and satanic and
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  I just wanted to get involved with whatever
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  God wanted me to get involved with, I
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  never had any plans of being a reporter
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  never had any plans of covering riots
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  never had any plans, I was a youth pastor
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  a pastoring a local church
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  in Southern California and that's what I was
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  doing, focusing on them, teaching the Bible
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  and kind of showing them the world around them
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  from a biblical worldview, but then this
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  just all unloaded
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  and God had a different plan for me, so
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  I guess to answer your question, this is a very loaded
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  answer, knowing and understanding
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  the urgency
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  of darkness rising
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  and attacking the current and the next
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  generation is what really
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  amplified me to move forward with the truth
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  and obedience to God
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  to oppose tyranny that I saw on the
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  horizon, so I think in God's
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  plan, I mean he's never done with us, just like
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  he's not done with you, Alex, and everyone else
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  that's listening right now,
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  I know he has a lot more in store and I think
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  this is just the beginning and we'll see where this goes
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  Man, I couldn't say any better
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  and it is that sense of urgency
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  and just like
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  Trump brought them out of the woodwork, now this
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  Roe v. Wade, bigger than Trump
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  take them off and they've done that
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  and I want to talk about what you've witnessed
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  at these anti
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  life rallies
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  and what you've witnessed at the border
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  and what you think is coming up
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  with the election
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  Drew Hernandez is our guest, we're with us some of the
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  next hour and then we're going to open the phones
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  up to balance the broadcast
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  the comedian we had on had a family
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  emergency so he's going to come on next week
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  we totally understand, so we're going to have
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  several hours of calls
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  after Drew leaves us
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  at least an hour and a half calls
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  and a bunch of news I haven't broken yet
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  next hour, hour number two with Drew Hernandez
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  just a wonderful guy
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  and I'm going to tell the story next hour
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  when we talk about this but I get really upset
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  looking at the people that serve Satan
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  how they're like mutants
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  I get very depressed about what God says to me
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  look at all the great people you get to know
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  who are on the other side, who are awake
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  and when you know people that know God
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  and know justice, they're just alive
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  you see the people that aren't, they're dead inside
[57:45.000 --> 58:13.000]  you can see the choice that needs to be made

[59:45.000 --> 59:47.000]  infowarsstore.com
[59:51.000 --> 59:53.000]  leading a frontal assault
[59:53.000 --> 59:55.000]  on the lies of the new world order
[59:55.000 --> 1:00:13.000]  it's Alex Jones
[1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  the only group that continues to enthusiastically
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  support Joe Biden is college educated
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  white voters in urban areas
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  particularly middle aged women with unhappy
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  personal lives
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  and three cats in an NPR tote bag
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  and wear a mask alone in the car
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  you are all in, everyone else is running away
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  effectively
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  what we're seeing is the end
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  of the modern democratic party
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  even MSNBC is noticed
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  this speaks to a story
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  we've been talking about 2020 election
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  specifically along the border
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  the Rio Grande Valley south Texas
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  we have seen county after county
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  whether it's in this district or some of the districts
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  to the west of it where voters have moved
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  10, 20, 30, 40
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  points away from the democrats
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  and toward the republicans
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  this district that Myra Flores won last night
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  Barack Obama got more than
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  60% of the vote here
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  when he last ran in 2012
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  Hillary Clinton won this district by 22
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  points it's shifted that dramatically
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  Joe Biden carried it by 4 in 2020
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  and now in a special election
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:15.000]  a republican candidate has won it outright
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  Barack Obama got more than 60%
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  of the vote in that district
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  now it's republican
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  this is an historic moment
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  Joe Biden has destroyed
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  the democratic coalition
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  so the question is since we have only two political parties
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  how are republican
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  leaders responding to this fact
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  to this opportunity
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  are they making the case for a better way
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  are they offering an alternative to what the democrats have brought this country
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  no they're not
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  they're doing something you never
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  would have expected
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  republican leaders are siding
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  with Joe Biden
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  at the very moment that Joe Biden is
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  at his weakest months
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  before a pivotal midterm election
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  republicans are propping him up
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  they are saving Biden from himself
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  since the day Biden was elected
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  republicans in washington
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  have taken Biden's side on virtually every
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  significant item in his policy agenda
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  that would include covid restrictions
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  vaccine mandates
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  transgender ideology in schools
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  sanctions against china
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  the january 6th charade
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  free speech civil liberties
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  spying by the intel agencies
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  preserving the big tech monopolies
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  the anti-white race politics of CRT
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  and juneteenth
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  border enforcement and energy policy
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  and above all the administrations
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  signature issue
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  it's lunatic and reckless support for the war on ukraine
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  republicans are all in
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  it's called kiv now
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  that's the republican message
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  for the midterm elections it's called kiv
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  and by the way
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  this isn't just happening in washington
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  it is endemic among the leaders
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  of solidly republican states in fact the more
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  republican the state the more liberal
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  the governor tends to be
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  the governor of texas which has some of the
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  biggest oil and gas deposits in the world
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  has decided to build windmills
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  that don't work
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  the governor of utah a state where Joe Biden
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  got 37% of the vote
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  that governor begins conversations
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  by announcing his preferred pronouns
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  he really does watch
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  well i thank you so much
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  gabby for that
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  that question
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  and my preferred pronouns are he him and his
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  so thank you for
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  sharing yours with me
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  it goes on
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  and on and on
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  the governor of south dakota where Joe Biden got
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  35% of the total vote
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  less than two years ago
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  that governor tried to let female impersonators
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  do sports in south dakota
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  in texas both senators can't stop talking
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  about how great juneteenth is
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  in arkansas
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  one of the most conservative states in the country
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  the governor supports the chemical castration
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  of children
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  the most recent action of the general assembly
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  while well intended
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  is off course
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  and i must veto house bill
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  1570
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  and just like that a bill to restrict children
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  under 18 from receiving chemical treatments
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  surgery for gender reassignment has been
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  stopped the governor said this bill is
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  government overreach interfering
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  by the state
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  in a parent in a child
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  in a doctor patient relationship
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  did not make sense to me
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  when you vote republican
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  in arkansas
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  you're voting for the castration of children
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  how many republican voters in arkansas knew that
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  when they voted for their republican governor
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  but it's everywhere
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  apart from governor ron disantis in florida
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  a few republican office holders are pushing back
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  in any way against anything
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  joe biden is doing in fact
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  they're abetting what he's doing
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  effectively they're coming to joe biden's

[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  biden just minutes ago
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  giving a speech saying a constitutional right
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  of americans to kill their babies
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  has been taken away
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  today the supreme court of the united states
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  expressly took away
[1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  a constitutional right from the american people
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  that it had already
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  recognized
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  they didn't limit it
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  they simply took it away
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  that's never been done
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  to a right so important to so many americans
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  but they did it
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  it's a sad day for the court
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  and for the country
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  so there's the KKK
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  sympathizer that judge joe brown
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  witnessed as a young man
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  say incredibly evil
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  hateful discriminatory
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  things up there as the president
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  saying that a right
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  has been taken away
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  we were gonna get him on about
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  i saw him on one of our other shows with a great job
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  harris the smiths american journal
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  last week
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  laying out just how
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  out of control this january 6
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  committee is swearing people in
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  but then editing videos
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  and letting witnesses hear what witnesses had to say
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  and so much more
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  he'll cover that later but today
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  the supreme court ruling on roe v wade
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  yesterday's ruling on the second amendment
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  saying new york and other states can't bar
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  concealed carries
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  this is a big big deal
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  what a historic moment
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  what does it really mean
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  what does he expect about to happen
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  the left is already all over the news saying
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  they're gonna peacefully burn down america this weekend
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  judge joe brown
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  you've got the floor my friend great to have you back
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  great patriot people can visit your website
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  the judge joe brown show
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  on twitter at judge joe brown tv
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  i saw you on
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  earlier this week with one of our crew amazing hour
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  thank you for spending time with us
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  i could ask a lot of questions but
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  where do you want to go from what i just laid out
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  okay let's start off
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  with new york's reaction
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  city mayor's reaction to
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  the ruling
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  about the constitutional
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  right to be harmed
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  in public i think it is a good thing
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  but our lawless
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  mayor gets up there
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  and not
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  our but the lawless mayor gets
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  up there and he advocates
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  right disobedience
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  of
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  the ruling by the u.s supreme court
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  i wonder if these hypocrites
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  on the clown show with the
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  j6 committee would be
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  interested in that because that sounds
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  just like what they were
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  accusing mr trump of
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  doing i wonder
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  if they want to pay attention to joe
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  biden doing what he did
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  today which is inviting
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  disobedience
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  of the latest
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  ruling by the u.s supreme court
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  and their support
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  for what is bound to be
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  some righteous
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  behavior in the streets
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  by certain
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  groups
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  this hypocrisy is awful
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  and then the thing that we hear
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  about the arkansas
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  governor which to me is right over
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  the bridge
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  here since i live in memphis
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  it strikes me that
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  uh
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  some things are being missed
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  if a child is injured
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  in an accident
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  they have to get the parent
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  a guardian in order to
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  get permission
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  to perform
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  surgery on this child
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  alright unless it's a dire
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  emergency and there's a cadre
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  of doctors that go along with
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  saying we have to
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  well why do we have this
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  support for elective
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  surgery pretty crudely
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  and they're only 15 years old
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  but that doesn't make any
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  sense and this whole position
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:21.000]  is based on some logical
[1:10:21.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  inconsistencies
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  and it just shows the hypocrisy
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  of the left
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  they want what they want they don't
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  give a damn about anything else
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  any other considerations except
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  their personal
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  exercise of license
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  rather than responsible
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  exercise of rights and this
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  isn't a right because children
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  under the law
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  are entitled
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  to appropriate supervision
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  they are not adults and they cannot
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  sign contracts they cannot
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  make binding agreements but
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  having your genitals
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  removed or
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  your sex change
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  is certainly
[1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000]  a binding contractual
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  agreement between the child
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  and somebody
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  let me stop
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  because some stations don't care that first 5 minutes
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000]  for those that just joined us
[1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  Tucker Carlson clip I played that little no man's land
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  first 5 minutes of some stations carrying some don't
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  was making the point that the Arkansas governor
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  overrode and vetoed the legislature
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  saying that we're not going to sterilize
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:27.000]  and cut the genitals off children
[1:11:27.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  if you or I walked into a hospital today
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  in Memphis, Tennessee or Austin, Texas
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:33.000]  or New York, New York or LA
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  and said I want my arm cut off
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  they'd call a patty wagon to take us to a mental institution
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  but if we want to
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  hell in Europe it's as young as 7
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  here as young as 10 as you said the average age
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  15 cut the penis
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  and balls off a child
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  then we don't want the parents involved the state
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  said the kid wants to be another gender
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  it's about tacky because you know
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  Arkansas is claiming parental rights in some cases
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  the state is coming in and trying to overwrite that
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  so this is mental illness
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  on its face being pushed by the state
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  what you're saying is out of the abortion
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  out of the gun control rulings
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  I agree with you this transgender movement
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  is the next leg of what they're doing
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  and it's just outrageous
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  but again, you're a judge
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  but am I not wrong that if I walked into a hospital
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  and said I want you to cut my right leg off
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  they'd put me in a mental institution
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  but I say my right leg
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  is not as important as my
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  dick and balls as you said
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  because that's how I make new people
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  that is a direct attack on my whole family line
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  and everything and I'd say
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  before I wanted my testicles cut off
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  I'd rather have my leg cut off
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  well you're right
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  it's an inconsistency
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  it's a hypocrisy
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  it's just a selfish focus
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  on immediate hedonistic pleasure
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  without any understanding
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  or respect for the other issues
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  that are brought up
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  I mean
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  what's more revocable than that
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  and then I tell a joke about it
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  a man or a woman
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  no
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  you see a successful screw
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  somebody
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  somebody is born
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  somebody matures after they get ready
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  that's right, sex did that
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  sex did that
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  they breathe and then you get the next generation
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  so these folks want to cut it off
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  because they can't handle it
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  it's just absolutely ridiculous
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  because even if the child
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  is hurt in an accident
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  they don't have to get a hold of a parent
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  or a guardian in order to get permission
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  for life saving surgery
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  so here is an elective
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  for some reason that the child
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  can't even fathom at that point
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  because remember starting at 8-9 years old
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  in this state
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  they were talking about having puberty blockers
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  so the person is never getting to the point
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  where hell is that hard
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  they can't buy a pack of cigarettes or a gun
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  they can't join the military
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  but they can decide to have their balls cut off
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  after they've been allowed to take
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  puberty blockers so they don't even
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  get their first heart on to find out
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  what it's all about
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  that's a good point, they don't want you to know
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  that's going to be the best part of your life right there
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  they don't want you to ever even experience that
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  see
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  there's another thing to it
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  part of this whole thing
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  with the tranny thing has got to do
[1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:17.000]  with the lifeboat situation
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  the next time a titanic goes down
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  with an I don't know if lifeboats
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  men's are supposed to say
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  ma'am you may have my seat
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  you and your child I'll drown with your chip when it goes down
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  see that takes a whole lot
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  but a lot of punks don't have that kind of manliness
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  and they want to deal with
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  oh I got on a dress
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  I should be able to get in there
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  my position's been no
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  grab them, snatch them
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  throw them on the other side of the ship
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  and chum the shark so the women and children
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  get away safe
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  that's an abdication
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  that's the perfect analogy of
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  the lifeboats are here and there's a bunch of men
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  in dresses trying to kick out the girls
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  and women
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  yes
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  see we have this thing
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  I have a model
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  it's all about protecting womanhood
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  and promoting manhood
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  why? because the women are a resource
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  they bear the children
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  a man can technically fertilize
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  quite a few women at the same time
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  so we've always had this thing
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  when it goes down the more successful men
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  they get around
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  now we have
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  managami but the men can
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  procreate they go off
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  we go off to the wars
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  we guard the front doors
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  we sacrifice ourselves
[1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  to protect our wives
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  and families and
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  life goes on and
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  your gene code gets continued
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  because the mother birthed the children
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  she could have been pregnant when you lost your life
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  and it's what it is
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  so beautifully said stay there sir
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  I want to come back and get more into this
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  Roe v. Wade the gun amendment
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  what the left's going to do judge joe browns our guest

[1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  1776 part two against the new world order
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:54.000]  because the answer to 1984
[1:16:54.000 --> 1:16:58.000]  is 1776
[1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:00.000]  at this point
[1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:02.000]  best case scenario
[1:17:02.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  is a few years of hard times
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  for us all
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  and if we don't turn it around soon
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:10.000]  then it will only get worse
[1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  but as bad as things are
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:14.000]  we still have time to prepare
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  and that alone is something to be grateful for

[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:26.000]  and having your own food
[1:17:26.000 --> 1:17:28.000]  will save you from getting ensnared
[1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  in government FEMA camps
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  and if you've already stocked up enough
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:34.000]  for your own family
[1:17:34.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  you might want to consider stocking up
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  for your neighbors
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  some of your neighbors might not be prepared
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:42.000]  for what's coming
[1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  but you can help them
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:46.000]  with the abundance of storable foods
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.000]  and water filtration
[1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  whoever sews bountifully

[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  than right here
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  and that's what people
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  recognize and resonate with
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  and as Ward said
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  you're not going to find a better place
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:14.000]  you might not agree with everything
[1:18:14.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  you might not agree with all our perspectives
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:18.000]  but we cover all the information
[1:18:18.000 --> 1:18:20.000]  and there's nowhere else really that does it
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  like we do here, thank you for that Ward
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  InfowarsStore.com by the way

[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:38.000]  as well
[1:18:38.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  look at the hair and beard support formula
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  this is a joke
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:44.000]  I mean we're giving this thing away
[1:18:44.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  it's 75% off by the way it works for me
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  in case you haven't noticed
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  the hair and beard formula is working for me
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  quite well
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  I might add
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  quite well my barber appreciates
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:58.000]  hair and beard support for men
[1:18:58.000 --> 1:19:00.000]  I go and see him quite often now

[1:19:24.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  I told you over two years ago
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000]  the globe was going to have massive inflation
[1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  and food shortages and it's happened
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000]  just like clockwork
[1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:34.000]  and I'm telling you it's going to get a lot worse

[1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  judge Joe Brown is a really articulate
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  smart guy I really admire him

[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:48.000]  I can ask a thousand questions
[1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  the rest of the hour trying to give him the floor to go where he wants
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  but let me ask him this
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:54.000]  where is America and the world
[1:20:54.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  right now how would you describe
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  the historic point we're at
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  because you have a great historical
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  I've had dinner with you and talked to you a lot
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  and I've done a lot of history you know more than I do
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:06.000]  I've been blown away by your knowledge
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  it's true folks well the smart people I know
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  what is the moment we're at
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  what is the choice humanity has
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  because the left is just running around
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:16.000]  like chickens with their heads cut off
[1:21:16.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  what's their problem why don't they want success
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  why don't they want order
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  why don't they want freedom
[1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  true liberalism which means freedom
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:26.000]  they're not the liberals to me they're the authoritarians
[1:21:26.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  what is
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  how would you quantify judge brown
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:32.000]  where we are today
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:36.000]  55 years ago
[1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  I had a
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:40.000]  course
[1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:42.000]  was a visiting professor
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  and professor said America is
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000]  in grave danger of becoming a fascist country
[1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  not from
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:50.000]  some jack booted
[1:21:50.000 --> 1:21:52.000]  goose stepping thugs
[1:21:52.000 --> 1:21:54.000]  but from as she
[1:21:54.000 --> 1:21:56.000]  turned it some pink
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  panty wearing long haired hips
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.000]  who would be
[1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.000]  trying to impose the worst methods
[1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  of fascism on everybody
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  for their own
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  perceived good
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:10.000]  and that's what we're getting
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:12.000]  and
[1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:14.000]  what you're looking at
[1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  is essentially
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:18.000]  an episode of two things
[1:22:18.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  one to make it real simple
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000]  read Orwell's animal farm
[1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  where the animal staged revolution
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  and took over a farm and they had a constitution
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  written on the side of a barn
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:30.000]  that said all animals are equal
[1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:32.000]  and then the pigs wound up
[1:22:32.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  pulling off a lot of stunts
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.000]  and taking some power and the constitution
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  changed it said all animals
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  are equal
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  but pigs are more equal
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  than others and that's what we have right now
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  we've got a pig pen developing
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  and it's there you go
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  that was put out by the CIA
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:52.000]  in 1952
[1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  to show in Europe
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.000]  so what you have is
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000]  a pig pen
[1:22:58.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  where we have a new category
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  of pigs who are
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  more equal than others
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  one of the things
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  that I find absolutely astonishing
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:10.000]  is this sense of entitlement
[1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  wearing in people say
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  I
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  wish upon a star
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:18.000]  makes no difference
[1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  who I am
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  my dreams should come true
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000]  makes no difference who you are
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  your dreams will come true
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  that's Walt Disney nonsense
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  and he'd been fed
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  a 50 some year
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  course of intense propaganda
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  from Hollywood and other sources
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  that all you have to do is want
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.000]  and you should have
[1:23:40.000 --> 1:23:42.000]  you see mothers that can barely
[1:23:42.000 --> 1:23:44.000]  pay the rent
[1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:46.000]  they get a little in their hand
[1:23:46.000 --> 1:23:48.000]  and they go out and buy their 9 year old
[1:23:48.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  the $260 pair of Air Jordan
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:52.000]  tennis shoes
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  where I want it so I should get it
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  it's not
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  necessary to go off
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  and do all of these difficult things
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  that are required
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:04.000]  becoming a human
[1:24:04.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  who is a free human
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  we should be entitled to it
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:10.000]  and what I see
[1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  is history repeating itself
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:14.000]  only this time it's not at State of America
[1:24:14.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  instead of Great Britain
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  because if you look
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  back to the 1920s
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  as you will see Great Britain
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  just came out of the
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  Great War
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  and
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:30.000]  they had this thing about
[1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  social programs
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  and they bankrupted themselves
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  and by the end of World War II
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  which was just 20 some years away
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  Great Britain
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  quickly fell into being a third rate
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:44.000]  not even second rate power
[1:24:44.000 --> 1:24:46.000]  and the United States took its position
[1:24:46.000 --> 1:24:48.000]  now Pakistan
[1:24:48.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  India much more powerful
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  militarily, economically
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.000]  scientifically
[1:24:54.000 --> 1:24:56.000]  and industrially
[1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000]  then Great Britain used to be
[1:24:58.000 --> 1:25:00.000]  so instead of
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  Britannia
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  ruling the waves and the Royal Navy
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  controlling
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  who moved on over
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  under the oceans now they can't even
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  man all their ships and what do they have
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  so Judge Brown let me ask you this question
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  that's where you're going
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000]  what powers commit suicide
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  because they get
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:22.000]  to indulgent
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  they get decadent
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:26.000]  to generate and to pray
[1:25:26.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  they get more in love with their luxuries
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  than they do with their freedom
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:32.000]  and they're willing to be safe
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  excuse me
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  they're willing to give up their freedom
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  to be safe and to ensure their luxuries
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.000]  and you mentioned this
[1:25:40.000 --> 1:25:42.000]  Biden to remove Title
[1:25:42.000 --> 1:25:44.000]  9 for women's rights
[1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  which I support women's rights
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.000]  in favor of gender identity
[1:25:48.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  letting men like you said on the Titanic
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  come in and take over that is crazy
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  well yeah
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  see one thing
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:58.000]  I think there is a need for one
[1:25:58.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  constitutional amendment
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  just one
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  and that one would read
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:06.000]  something like the
[1:26:06.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  body of a bill
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:10.000]  or piece of legislation has to
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  reflect the caption
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:14.000]  they introduced the Emmett Till
[1:26:14.000 --> 1:26:16.000]  anti-lynch bill
[1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  let's not go into
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  all of the details
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:22.000]  but they added something
[1:26:22.000 --> 1:26:24.000]  which is
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  gender orientation
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  to the American
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  legal lexicon
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  or federal lexicon
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  for the first time so
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:36.000]  that came in under a so-called
[1:26:36.000 --> 1:26:38.000]  anti-lynch bill
[1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  but it applies now to all American
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:42.000]  laws so
[1:26:42.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  what the hell do you mean by that
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  you have ordinarily
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  you can't discriminate against
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  anyone because of race
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  color, national origin
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  religion, sex
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  age
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  medical condition
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  and
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  what we have now is a different
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  kind of thing where somebody says
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  I have an extra
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.000]  choice I can make
[1:27:08.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  I can be lying through my chief
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:12.000]  but if I'm punk enough to go out
[1:27:12.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  and say oh I'm a sissy
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  then I can get
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  declared to be a woman
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:20.000]  I might not be able to make the varsity
[1:27:20.000 --> 1:27:22.000]  so instead of sitting in the stands
[1:27:22.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  and cheering like everybody else
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  who can't I get to go
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:28.000]  declare that I've got
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  girl in me and put on a skirt
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:32.000]  no I want to be a girl in all this
[1:27:32.000 --> 1:27:34.000]  and I can go out and play with the girls
[1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  and we even violate
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  normal precepts like
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  boys are stronger than girls
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:42.000]  therefore boys should never hit girls
[1:27:42.000 --> 1:27:44.000]  so now we have little
[1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:46.000]  punks out there in full calm
[1:27:46.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  courts crippling, maiming
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.000]  and badly hurting
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  we have UFC fighters
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  killing women, men killing women
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  fighting women
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:58.000]  imagine if Mike Tyson was in the
[1:27:58.000 --> 1:28:00.000]  ring with a woman we would say
[1:28:00.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  arresting but oh if he saves a woman it's okay
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  well this is
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  personal to me
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  not long ago I was
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  in the parking lot of
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  well one of these
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  discount hardware store
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  I think it was Lowe's
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  and this beautiful woman
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  said Uncle Joe and I looked over
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:24.000]  and I didn't recognize her at first
[1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:26.000]  and then when I did
[1:28:26.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  I said baby what
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:30.000]  what happened to your arms she had her arm up
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  and a strut
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  and a contrivance around
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  her waist to keep it up
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  and I hadn't seen her since she had
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  been 11 or 12 but a grandfather
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:42.000]  would always talk to me about her
[1:28:42.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  she'd been a martial artist since she'd been 8 years old
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  hold on Judge Joe Brown stay there
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.000]  tell us the story when we come back

[1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:50.000]  I would not procrastinate ladies and gentlemen
[1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  one of the most important things you can do
[1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.000]  is get out of inflation now
[1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:56.000]  because the inflation is just beginning
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:58.000]  the first ten amendments to our country's
[1:31:58.000 --> 1:32:00.000]  constitution were adopted in 1791
[1:32:00.000 --> 1:32:02.000]  the first of these broadly protects
[1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:04.000]  the rights of free speech
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  and free press
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  free speech means the free
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:10.000]  and public expression of opinions
[1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:12.000]  without censorship
[1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:14.000]  interference and restraint
[1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:16.000]  by the government
[1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:18.000]  231 years later
[1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:20.000]  free speech across America
[1:32:20.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  is under chronic and insidious attack
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:24.000]  GCN is under attack
[1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:26.000]  your freedom is currently under siege
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  from those who do not want you to know the truth
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:30.000]  I'm asking our fellow broadcasters

[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.000]  to rise up and help us defend our right
[1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  to continue telling you the truth
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  would you like to join us
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  if so please consider visiting

[1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:56.000]  you may select all of those choices
[1:32:56.000 --> 1:33:12.000]  I'm Vincent Finnelli
[1:33:26.000 --> 1:33:36.000]  music
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000]  so Judge Joe Brown
[1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:40.000]  who just joined us was talking about
[1:33:40.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  women being beaten
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:44.000]  after death in some cases to death
[1:33:44.000 --> 1:33:46.000]  by men
[1:33:46.000 --> 1:33:48.000]  and men women cycling contest
[1:33:48.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  and track and field contest
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000]  and swimming contest
[1:33:52.000 --> 1:33:54.000]  they can sell that
[1:33:54.000 --> 1:33:56.000]  lie they can sell anything
[1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000]  it's a war against logic so you were getting into that
[1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.000]  and finishing up with a story
[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  you told about a woman you met
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:04.000]  in a parking lot that you've known for a long time
[1:34:04.000 --> 1:34:06.000]  you've forgotten about them
[1:34:06.000 --> 1:34:08.000]  you're obviously a celebrity and don't meet a lot of people
[1:34:08.000 --> 1:34:10.000]  and then I want to ask you the big picture
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  what do we do Judge Joe Brown
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  about this assault
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  what is the average person listening to
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  to counter that please continue
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:20.000]  well let me tell you the story
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  I hadn't seen her since she had been about 11 years old
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  she grew up beautiful
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:26.000]  movie star beautiful but she had her arm in a cast
[1:34:26.000 --> 1:34:28.000]  and it was propped up
[1:34:28.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  shoulder to
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000]  and I asked her what happened
[1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000]  she had been a martial artist since she had been 8 or 9 years old
[1:34:34.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  and she got a scholarship to a major university
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000]  doing women's wrestling
[1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  well right before Covid
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000]  hit hard she had been
[1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  in a tournament and she was
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  set up to wrestle this
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000]  what turned out to be a guy
[1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000]  she refused and so did another
[1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:52.000]  member of her team and they were told
[1:34:52.000 --> 1:34:54.000]  they would lose their scholarships and the team would forfeit
[1:34:54.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  if they didn't
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  so the other woman got a broken jaw
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  and put in a coma for 3 days
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:02.000]  and my friend's granddaughter
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:04.000]  got a compound
[1:35:04.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  factor of her arm that this creek did
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000]  to her and she was
[1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.000]  crying to me cried on my shoulder
[1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  literally about she had to go through
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:14.000]  3 surgeries how badly
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:16.000]  it hurt and she couldn't stand the pain
[1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:18.000]  but when she took the medication
[1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  she couldn't focus on her studies
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  what was she going to do and it just
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000]  wasn't fair well it wasn't
[1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:26.000]  and these dirty creeps
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000]  don't need to be allowed to compete
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:30.000]  against women they're sissies
[1:35:30.000 --> 1:35:32.000]  they're punks they need to sit
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  in the damn bleachers like everybody
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:36.000]  else who can't make the
[1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.000]  men's team
[1:35:38.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  and this is just absolutely
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:42.000]  absurd
[1:35:42.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  it is absolutely unfair
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:46.000]  and it is dangerous
[1:35:46.000 --> 1:35:48.000]  now women have fought long and hard
[1:35:48.000 --> 1:35:50.000]  to get equality in sports
[1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  and it doesn't make any damn
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:54.000]  sense to allow some
[1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.000]  creep who ought to be ashamed
[1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  of himself to come in and cry
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  to claim to be a girl
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  and compete against the girls
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  so it's
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000]  particularly repugnant and I
[1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:08.000]  commend all state legislative bodies
[1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  that are doing something about it
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:12.000]  hell I saw a thing somebody
[1:36:12.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  called me up about just this week
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000]  I had Bruce Jenner on there and he was talking
[1:36:16.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  about he thought it was unfair
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:20.000]  for guys to be
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  allowed to compete against girls
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  in women's sports
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:26.000]  and that from a former
[1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.000]  male Olympic athlete
[1:36:28.000 --> 1:36:30.000]  gold medal at the time
[1:36:30.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  or two in what was it swimming
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:34.000]  so it's
[1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000]  gotten really far out of hand
[1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  and we need to bring that back
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:40.000]  into focus you know
[1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  just because you want something
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  doesn't mean you should be able to get
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000]  just because you say you're an Easter Bunny
[1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:48.000]  doesn't make it so or Santa Claus
[1:36:48.000 --> 1:36:50.000]  so how do we counter this
[1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:52.000]  madness Judge Brown
[1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  I can fly we'll go jump off that
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:56.000]  each story building if you can fly then
[1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000]  so how do we
[1:36:58.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  counter this madness where do you see America going
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  speaking of
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  which you're blind you can't drive
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:06.000]  the car I imagine
[1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  there are a lot of blind people who would love
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  to operate a car but they can't
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  because they can't see
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000]  so
[1:37:14.000 --> 1:37:16.000]  what do you suppose to do well it's the same thing
[1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  I mean I can fight but I couldn't be
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  a heavyweight boxer get my ass kicked those are
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:22.000]  professionals the top one ten to one percent
[1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  who train their whole lives
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  the idea that I can be a marathon runner I can run
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:28.000]  two miles I can't run 23
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.000]  it's just so simple I mean it's
[1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  right there
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  what let me bring us back to another thing
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.000]  alright just a bit about
[1:37:36.000 --> 1:37:38.000]  protecting everyone oh my god we're
[1:37:38.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  going to end the violence we're going to have
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  rules against guns well okay
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  they keep talking about assault rifles
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:46.000]  and what they're talking about a generally
[1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:48.000]  just some autos and let's see
[1:37:48.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  interesting an anniversary
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000]  past three months ago
[1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:54.000]  the AR
[1:37:54.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  which stands for armillite design
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:58.000]  of
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000]  Stoner
[1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  Eugene Stoner
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  who designed it
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.000]  was patented 70 years
[1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:08.000]  ago this year
[1:38:08.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  in February
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  so this is not something new this
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  is an antique AK-47
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:16.000]  was adopted 75 years
[1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:18.000]  ago
[1:38:18.000 --> 1:38:20.000]  in 1947 so this
[1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  is nothing new
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  we have some antique firearms
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:26.000]  and what people are
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:28.000]  putting out there with false propaganda
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:30.000]  is it their assault rifle
[1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  no they're not a real
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  assault rifle is a fully automatic
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  weapon a machine gun
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  you know like Al Capone
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000]  and
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  Elliot Ness
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:44.000]  or whatever you may have
[1:38:44.000 --> 1:38:46.000]  or John Wayne
[1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:48.000]  charging a machine gun nest
[1:38:48.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  with his Thompson or whatever it may be
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  so
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:38:54.000]  that isn't even the issue
[1:38:54.000 --> 1:38:56.000]  in Switzerland
[1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:58.000]  every able-bodied man
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:00.000]  from 17 to 56
[1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  is required to have a military
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  grade 9mm pistol
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  in his possession
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  and a machine gun
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:10.000]  a fully automatic
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  a real one
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000]  and two hand grenades
[1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  and various incendiary rounds of ammunition
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:18.000]  but
[1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000]  they don't have any of these
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:22.000]  crazed fools running around
[1:39:22.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  killing folk off in mass
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000]  now every now and then
[1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  seems a banker or two over in
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  Switzerland had to get his drugs
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:32.000]  and one or two of them might get off
[1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.000]  by somebody that came in
[1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:36.000]  from out of the country
[1:39:36.000 --> 1:39:38.000]  but had got a violent crime as zero
[1:39:38.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  and it brings it to me now
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  I'm 74 years old
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  but I've been taking martial arts for
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  55 years
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  and myself and some of my associates
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000]  we can kill most humans who are
[1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:52.000]  comparably trained very quickly
[1:39:52.000 --> 1:39:54.000]  a lot quicker than we could kill them
[1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:56.000]  with a pistol or a firearm
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:39:58.000]  or an AR
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  exactly so we want to punish criminals
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  not the general public let me ask this question then
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:04.000]  how do we fix this
[1:40:04.000 --> 1:40:06.000]  an awakening, education
[1:40:06.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  it seems like America is going over a cliff
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  we're going over a cliff
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  because we've attempted to
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  emasculate the country
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  in favor of these people who want to
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:18.000]  let children at 15
[1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:20.000]  cut the dicks and balls off
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.000]  so stop letting the left bully us
[1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  and stop laying down the answer
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000]  yeah well yes
[1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000]  the other thing is
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  let's take this thing about bullying
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:32.000]  look at back to the future
[1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000]  back in the 1980s
[1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:36.000]  McFly goes back
[1:40:36.000 --> 1:40:38.000]  talked his father into standing up for himself
[1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  dad busts the bully in his mouth
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:42.000]  knocks him out
[1:40:42.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  when young McFly gets back
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:46.000]  the bully works for his dad
[1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  instead of running rough
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:50.000]  shot over him
[1:40:50.000 --> 1:40:52.000]  we've always had this thing
[1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:54.000]  in human society of boys
[1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000]  and stand up
[1:40:56.000 --> 1:40:58.000]  and screw up
[1:40:58.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  they're really afraid of men
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:02.000]  yeah they don't like it
[1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  so we have had a 55 year campaign
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:06.000]  to emasculate the country
[1:41:06.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  I heard this starting back in the mid
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:10.000]  60s when I was at UCLA
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  as an undergrad
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:14.000]  you had the lesbians who hated
[1:41:14.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  men
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  the feminists who hated
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.000]  that they weren't men
[1:41:20.000 --> 1:41:22.000]  the beta boys that hated it
[1:41:22.000 --> 1:41:24.000]  and be real men
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  the gay folk that didn't understand
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:28.000]  being a man
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  and then you got that anti-war crowd
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:32.000]  and they said war is a man thing
[1:41:32.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  so if we raise boys like girls
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  so they are emotional
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:38.000]  and they
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:40.000]  cry and shout and let it all
[1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  hang out
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  if you created a show and did it all
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  it would still take it
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  we would step forward
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:50.000]  so you get all of these together
[1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:52.000]  and they started to try to
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:41:54.000]  and to an extent
[1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  accomplish the
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:58.000]  emasculation of the country
[1:41:58.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  meanwhile January 21st, 2021
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:02.000]  the Chinese government
[1:42:02.000 --> 1:42:04.000]  put in place an official man up
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  campaign and Russia's already had
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:08.000]  one and about 10, 12, 15 years ago
[1:42:08.000 --> 1:42:10.000]  they banned
[1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  Americans from
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.000]  adopting Russian orphans
[1:42:14.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  because they did not want them
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  turned to the dark side
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  talking about gay folk per se
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  I mean if you want to get your
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  freak on in your bedroom that's your damn business
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  what I'm talking about is the
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  LGBTQ cult
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:30.000]  the rainbow cult
[1:42:30.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  now
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:34.000]  Judaism, Islam, Christianity
[1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000]  Hinduism
[1:42:36.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  Confucianism, Buddhism
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:40.000]  there are religions but the last two
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:42.000]  don't have a god
[1:42:42.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  they are systems of philosophy
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  so if you look at LGBTQ
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:48.000]  that way you'll see what I'm talking about
[1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  Judge Brown stay there
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.000]  I want to talk about January 6th committee
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  I want to talk about the election
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  so much more stay with us
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:00.000]  the globalists are making their move
[1:43:00.000 --> 1:43:02.000]  their great reset is here

[1:43:10.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  with their biomedical tyranny
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  they're coming for your free speech

[1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:24.000]  that you and your fellow Americans choose
[1:43:24.000 --> 1:43:26.000]  the new film

[1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  2000 mules
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:00.000]  the eugenicists over 100 years ago
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:02.000]  were very public about their plans
[1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.000]  they financed major universities
[1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:06.000]  they ran full page stories
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  and advertisements
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.000]  pushing their propaganda of New York Times
[1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  and other major newspapers
[1:44:12.000 --> 1:44:14.000]  that the family as we know it is a bad thing
[1:44:14.000 --> 1:44:16.000]  and must be ended
[1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  the first step in that
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:20.000]  is getting women out of the household
[1:44:20.000 --> 1:44:22.000]  teaching women that cooking dinner
[1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  and taking care of their sons and daughters
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:26.000]  and husbands is a bad thing
[1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000]  and I was just sitting here tonight making dinner
[1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:30.000]  for my daughter, my four national daughter
[1:44:30.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  my wife makes dinner a lot of times
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:34.000]  but I like to make it as well, I love to make breakfast
[1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:36.000]  and literally it's the funnest thing on earth
[1:44:36.000 --> 1:44:38.000]  to make food for your family
[1:44:38.000 --> 1:44:40.000]  and be nurturative
[1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:42.000]  and then all sit down together and have the communal event
[1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000]  and that's what the system
[1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  is attacking and bombarding
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:48.000]  is our normal biological actions
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:50.000]  and coming together
[1:44:50.000 --> 1:44:52.000]  they really are a sick evil scientific
[1:44:52.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  cult of filth
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:56.000]  and want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats

[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:36.000]  on this January 6th committee
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  and supporting what they're doing
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  and they're saying that Trump was wrong
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  by trying to incite the American public
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000]  when he said the election was stolen
[1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  some of them were up
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  22 years ago in the
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:50.000]  2000 election cycle
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:52.000]  screaming
[1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  from the rooftops

[1:48:56.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  Bush had stolen the election
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000]  from Gore
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  and I remember that old thing with dangling chads
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:04.000]  and debacle down in Florida
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:06.000]  that
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:08.000]  went on and on so
[1:49:08.000 --> 1:49:10.000]  what's the matter they can talk but nobody else can
[1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  but anyway
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  I don't have much confidence
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  in Biden and Mrs.
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  Imhoff
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:20.000]  that administration handling
[1:49:20.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  what is likely to develop with the Russians
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:26.000]  down in Syria
[1:49:26.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  the Russian
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  Air Force
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:32.000]  did
[1:49:32.000 --> 1:49:34.000]  an attention getting
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  bombing or attack on
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:38.000]  a certain rebel
[1:49:38.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  base
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  where Americans had been
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:44.000]  training some of the folk
[1:49:44.000 --> 1:49:46.000]  going back up to the Ukraine
[1:49:46.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  that could lead to
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:50.000]  a shooting incident
[1:49:50.000 --> 1:49:52.000]  or two or three or four, ten or twenty down there
[1:49:52.000 --> 1:49:54.000]  in that area
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:49:56.000]  and I don't think Biden and Imhoff
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:58.000]  were competent to handle it
[1:49:58.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  that's right, that's really smart what you're saying
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.000]  as I've been covering that but I meant to a few days ago
[1:50:02.000 --> 1:50:04.000]  this war is widening into Syria
[1:50:04.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  Turkey you name it
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  yeah and it's getting out of hand
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  I have a sneaking suspicion that the reason
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  we're over in the Ukraine in the first place
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  is so Biden can get this
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  hundred and twenty
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:18.000]  some count indictment against him
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  dismiss
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000]  for
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:24.000]  services rendered
[1:50:24.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  because you still have
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  article well
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000]  well that's the next question
[1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000]  why would he brag five years ago
[1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  on C-Span that he ordered the prosecutor
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:36.000]  fired they wouldn't give a million dollars
[1:50:36.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  before he left office
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:40.000]  why would you brag about crimes you committed
[1:50:40.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  not one million
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:44.000]  it was fourteen billion
[1:50:44.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  in American loan guarantees
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  he said I guess I
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  am guilty of bribery
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000]  and extortion because I told
[1:50:52.000 --> 1:50:54.000]  them that I'd see to it
[1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  that they're fourteen billion dollars
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:50:58.000]  in loan guarantee
[1:50:58.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  no I agree judge you're right
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  it's on record why would he admit that
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:04.000]  I'm asking you why
[1:51:04.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  he's never been the brightest bulb
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  on sale in the store
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:10.000]  now that being the case
[1:51:10.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  it's a real live mess
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:14.000]  see article six of the US
[1:51:14.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  constitution says
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  ratified treaties are part
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  of the supreme law of the land
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  and one of our ratified treaties
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  is with Ukraine and it says
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  we will honor
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  agreements with them to apprehend
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.000]  and assist in the investment
[1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  so they're using that as a blank check
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  element
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  and then they set up another one
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:38.000]  and I love this one when they went after
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  Mr. Trump and impeached him
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:42.000]  the second time
[1:51:42.000 --> 1:51:44.000]  although he was no longer in office
[1:51:44.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  they set the precedent
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:48.000]  so article two section four
[1:51:48.000 --> 1:51:50.000]  of the constitution says impeachment
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:52.000]  for bribery
[1:51:52.000 --> 1:51:54.000]  treason and high crimes
[1:51:54.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  and misdemeanors in office those three things
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  well he's already admitted
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  he's into bribery
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:02.000]  we have indictments in Ukraine
[1:52:02.000 --> 1:52:04.000]  charging him with bribery
[1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  extortion
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  etc etc
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  that's certainly a high crime
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  and or misdemeanors in office
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  and while we will be
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  even though he's no longer vice president
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  they already set the stage so when
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  the democratic party gets
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  their behinds kicked in these midterms
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  what with their
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  approval ratings being so damn low
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  they've opened it up
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:30.000]  to go after Biden
[1:52:30.000 --> 1:52:32.000]  and the reason they went after Mr. Trump
[1:52:32.000 --> 1:52:34.000]  was because of the 12th amendment
[1:52:34.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  that says if you've been impeached
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  you can't hold any office again
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:40.000]  I agree with you so I'm asking
[1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  why would the democratic party commit suicide like this
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:44.000]  they don't know
[1:52:44.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  any better they don't think the rules
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  apply to them they are myopic
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  in their sight they have this
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  oh this is what I want
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  it's like a child wanting an ice cream cone
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  and they throw a tantrum
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  they forget about everything
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  outside of that ice cream cone
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  or candy it or you see them
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  pitching a tantrum
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:06.000]  in the aisles at a department
[1:53:06.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  store when you get to the toy
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  department
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:12.000]  they stomp and they carry on
[1:53:12.000 --> 1:53:14.000]  and they bang their fist on the ground
[1:53:14.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  and they roll all over
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  the place and they're screeching I want it
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:20.000]  I want it and they don't care about what's
[1:53:20.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  going on that's because
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  they are essentially immature
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  they agree
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  that's why they've run their cities on the ground
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  you're right that's scary though
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:32.000]  the people in charge of the country do you see
[1:53:32.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  Biden today blame gas stations or gas prices
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  oh yeah
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:38.000]  and then look at this you know what the
[1:53:38.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  travesty is for those gas prices
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:42.000]  is this
[1:53:42.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  the
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  crude oil
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  that has been refined
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:50.000]  and is on sale right now
[1:53:50.000 --> 1:53:52.000]  was acquired
[1:53:52.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  13 14 months ago
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  at those prices and a great deal
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  of it has been pulled out of reserves
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  thanks to buy exactly so it's
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:02.000]  about to explode in price
[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  the price is from
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  40 50 60
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:08.000]  70 years ago
[1:54:08.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  now here's another thing 99
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  percent
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  of all domestically consumed
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  oil is imported
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  we don't have any alternative energy
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  sources being funded they need to have
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  a Manhattan project on that like
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  they did with the bomb during World
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  War two but Biden's
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  administration is pushing this
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  so when you have imported
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:34.000]  oil what happens is 25
[1:54:34.000 --> 1:54:36.000]  percent has to go into the American
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:38.000]  oil reserves and by law
[1:54:40.000 --> 1:54:42.000]  the oil importers
[1:54:42.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  get paid $5
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:46.000]  per barrel
[1:54:46.000 --> 1:54:48.000]  for whatever market price
[1:54:48.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  or what goes into the reserve
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  so they're making money hand over
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  foot and look at the price of
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  fuel for trucks
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  that is essentially a
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  by-product
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  it's waste
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  all the angles is amazing and closing
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  what do you expect to happen
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  under all this malfeasance
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  well
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  we're going to have a big hold
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  we're going to have to climb out of and I hope it
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:16.000]  isn't a bottomless rabbit hole
[1:55:16.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  and we wind up like Great Britain
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  a secondary power
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  with the People's Republic of China
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  lording it over everybody's
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  so that's the danger
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:28.000]  they have cut too much
[1:55:28.000 --> 1:55:30.000]  off they are destroying manhood
[1:55:30.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  they're destroying education
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  they're pricing everything
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  out of reach
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  they have engendered deliberate
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:40.000]  inflation and I say that on purpose
[1:55:40.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  because that helps out the financial
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:44.000]  market
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  the investment market
[1:55:46.000 --> 1:55:48.000]  because it reduces existing
[1:55:48.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  loan loads
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:52.000]  and debt obligations
[1:55:52.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  and we've got a bunch of creeps
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  in there that are more interested
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  in who gets to play girl
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  than they are in the effectiveness
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:02.000]  to deal with the other 97%
[1:56:02.000 --> 1:56:04.000]  of the American
[1:56:04.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  population
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:08.000]  so we've reached that moment of
[1:56:08.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  what do you see happening
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:12.000]  with the midterms
[1:56:12.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  election?
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  I think that the Democratic Party
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  is going to get slaughtered
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:20.000]  every time for the last half century
[1:56:20.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  when one party's
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:24.000]  percentages
[1:56:24.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  of support drop is low
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  below a certain point
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  that party always
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  loses control of whatever
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  chamber of Congress it controls
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:36.000]  and Bidens are the
[1:56:36.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  worst ever
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  and interestingly enough
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  if it would be replacement
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:44.000]  Camilla Imhoff
[1:56:44.000 --> 1:56:46.000]  well Harris Imhoff
[1:56:46.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  hers are the absolute
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  worst ever
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:52.000]  Biru Agnew
[1:56:52.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  who wound up doing time in state
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  and federal penitentiaries
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  when he was vice president
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:00.000]  to Tricky Dick Nixon
[1:57:00.000 --> 1:57:02.000]  even after he resigned because
[1:57:02.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  of criminal charges pending
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:06.000]  his ratings are better than
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  Camilla Harris Imhoff
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  this is a complete disaster
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  we've got two incompetents
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:14.000]  sitting up there
[1:57:14.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  in line one's already
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  in office and he can't even remember
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  where the hell he is let alone
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  what's going on
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:24.000]  and Camilla Harris has always
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:26.000]  been lazy she wants the show
[1:57:26.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  so you're right Judge Joe Brown Amazing

[1:59:18.000 --> 1:59:20.000]  the most important documentary ever made in my view
[1:59:20.000 --> 1:59:22.000]  2000 mules is now available

[1:59:40.000 --> 1:59:42.000]  they're planning to run the same scams again
[1:59:42.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  this film can stop them if you take action
[1:59:44.000 --> 1:59:46.000]  infowarstore.com
[1:59:46.000 --> 2:00:04.000]  2000 mules
[2:00:04.000 --> 2:00:16.000]  music plays
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:18.000]  well you need to read the Old Testament so you didn't know
[2:00:18.000 --> 2:00:20.000]  you read that
[2:00:20.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  everything is going to happen exactly as it's going to happen
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:24.000]  I'm just giving credit words too
[2:00:24.000 --> 2:00:26.000]  and you know that's that paradox
[2:00:26.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  they're good Germans
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:30.000]  they're bad Germans they're good Christians
[2:00:30.000 --> 2:00:32.000]  they're bad Christians they're good Jews or bad Jews
[2:00:32.000 --> 2:00:34.000]  but I gotta say
[2:00:34.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  it is amazing
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:38.000]  that Ezekiel
[2:00:38.000 --> 2:00:40.000]  and Moses and everything
[2:00:40.000 --> 2:00:42.000]  is just so powerful
[2:00:42.000 --> 2:00:44.000]  a few minutes because I know you're a humblesome
[2:00:44.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  but how did the Jews
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:48.000]  particularly foresee all of this
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:50.000]  out of all the cultures
[2:00:50.000 --> 2:00:52.000]  because the more I study it
[2:00:52.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  the more those ancient Jews
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:56.000]  5,000, 6,000, 3,000 years ago
[2:00:56.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  are dead on you know Plato I've given credit to
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:00.000]  he made a lot of predictions
[2:01:00.000 --> 2:01:02.000]  made a lot of things 2,000, 3,000 years ago
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:04.000]  but so the Greeks you gotta give some credit to too
[2:01:04.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  but what's what's going on
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:08.000]  what's going on with Jews knowing all this
[2:01:08.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  and that somebody like Harari
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:12.000]  turns his back completely on it
[2:01:12.000 --> 2:01:14.000]  Jews are absolutely nothing
[2:01:14.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  without the law
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:18.000]  and without
[2:01:18.000 --> 2:01:20.000]  obeying the Creator
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  and serving as
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:24.000]  a light unto the nation
[2:01:24.000 --> 2:01:26.000]  by bringing the knowledge
[2:01:26.000 --> 2:01:28.000]  of the Creator into the creation
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:30.000]  and no one's denying that
[2:01:30.000 --> 2:01:32.000]  it was the Jewish faith
[2:01:32.000 --> 2:01:34.000]  that brought
[2:01:34.000 --> 2:01:36.000]  the morality
[2:01:36.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  and God's law into the world
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:40.000]  and so it really
[2:01:40.000 --> 2:01:42.000]  starts with the characteristics
[2:01:42.000 --> 2:01:44.000]  and attributes of the first Jew
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:46.000]  Abraham
[2:01:46.000 --> 2:01:48.000]  now let me just paint a picture of how he grew up
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:50.000]  he grew up in a world where no one believed in the one God
[2:01:50.000 --> 2:01:52.000]  everyone was
[2:01:52.000 --> 2:01:54.000]  an idol worshiper including his own father
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:56.000]  and he sensed
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  just logically rationally
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:00.000]  something not right here it doesn't make sense
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:02.000]  and he used his mind
[2:02:02.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  and came to the conclusion that no
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:06.000]  there must be a primal cause
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  of one God that
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  set everything into motion
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  and he went public about that
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  and
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:16.000]  he was not like
[2:02:16.000 --> 2:02:18.000]  actually the entire world tried to kill him
[2:02:18.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  and he said I don't care
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:22.000]  I'm gonna stand up for my principles my beliefs
[2:02:22.000 --> 2:02:24.000]  and there is I'm gonna
[2:02:24.000 --> 2:02:26.000]  sanctify the name of God
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  even if it cost me my life
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  and he was the only one on the planet doing it
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:32.000]  but that was the essence of the stubbornness
[2:02:32.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  this arrogance
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:36.000]  but for God
[2:02:36.000 --> 2:02:38.000]  every attribute could be used
[2:02:38.000 --> 2:02:40.000]  for good and for bad
[2:02:40.000 --> 2:02:42.000]  and if you have an arrogant streak in you
[2:02:42.000 --> 2:02:44.000]  but a stubborn streak
[2:02:44.000 --> 2:02:46.000]  but if you use it
[2:02:46.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  to serve God then it's not necessarily bad
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:50.000]  and so
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:52.000]  Abraham was a stubborn God
[2:02:52.000 --> 2:02:54.000]  and he stood up to the entire world
[2:02:54.000 --> 2:02:56.000]  and said no I'm not gonna worship your idols
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:58.000]  you are
[2:02:58.000 --> 2:03:00.000]  wrong and there is a creator
[2:03:00.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  so to answer your question
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:04.000]  it's not
[2:03:04.000 --> 2:03:06.000]  it's nothing special about us
[2:03:06.000 --> 2:03:08.000]  it's the fact that we were
[2:03:08.000 --> 2:03:10.000]  tasked to put into
[2:03:10.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  a role
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:14.000]  and only when we observe that role
[2:03:14.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  is there
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:18.000]  a certain grace
[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:20.000]  that's brought into the world
[2:03:20.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  of God are any of us strong
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  correct
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:26.000]  I know you gotta go but we got another guest
[2:03:26.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  coming up we got
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:30.000]  you never plugged this stuff but it's a great product

[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:34.000]  so do a few more minutes and we'll come back for a break
[2:03:34.000 --> 2:03:36.000]  I want to talk about ZStack and the other products
[2:03:36.000 --> 2:03:38.000]  but start talking about it now
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:40.000]  you got a new website for it
[2:03:40.000 --> 2:03:42.000]  it's ZDT or ZDtoxlife.com
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:44.000]  you're also supporting us
[2:03:44.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  Doctor spin a minute or so
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:48.000]  talk about these products you've got
[2:03:48.000 --> 2:03:50.000]  a bunch of great products
[2:03:50.000 --> 2:03:52.000]  well NAC is
[2:03:52.000 --> 2:03:54.000]  stop the blood clots
[2:03:54.000 --> 2:03:56.000]  and for some reason there's a lot of blood clots going around
[2:03:56.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  killing people right
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  heart attacks and strokes
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:02.000]  so if you're at risk for blood clots
[2:04:02.000 --> 2:04:04.000]  NAC is over the counter option
[2:04:04.000 --> 2:04:06.000]  which is great
[2:04:06.000 --> 2:04:08.000]  then EGCG it's a green tea extract
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:10.000]  is one of the most powerful
[2:04:10.000 --> 2:04:12.000]  zinc ionophores that get zinc into the cell
[2:04:12.000 --> 2:04:14.000]  and then it has zinc
[2:04:14.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  because zinc stops RNA viruses
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:18.000]  from replicating
[2:04:18.000 --> 2:04:20.000]  stay there come back and just do

[2:05:52.000 --> 2:05:54.000]  It's 75% off right now
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:56.000]  on Infowarscore.com
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:05:58.000]  and don't forget Alex Jones' right t-shirt while you're there
[2:06:02.000 --> 2:06:04.000]  So if it's going to be used
[2:06:04.000 --> 2:06:06.000]  it's better to focus on
[2:06:06.000 --> 2:06:08.000]  those groups who have risk of
[2:06:08.000 --> 2:06:10.000]  severe disease and death
[2:06:10.000 --> 2:06:12.000]  rather than as we see
[2:06:12.000 --> 2:06:14.000]  these are using to give boosters to
[2:06:14.000 --> 2:06:16.000]  kill children which is
[2:06:16.000 --> 2:06:18.000]  not right.
[2:06:18.000 --> 2:06:20.000]  So when your
[2:06:20.000 --> 2:06:22.000]  government scientists tell you
[2:06:22.000 --> 2:06:24.000]  that a variant that's 0.3%
[2:06:24.000 --> 2:06:26.000]  different from SARS
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:28.000]  could masquerade as
[2:06:28.000 --> 2:06:30.000]  a new virus and be a threat to your health
[2:06:30.000 --> 2:06:32.000]  you should know and I'm telling you
[2:06:32.000 --> 2:06:34.000]  they are lying.
[2:06:34.000 --> 2:06:36.000]  If they're lying
[2:06:36.000 --> 2:06:38.000]  and they are
[2:06:38.000 --> 2:06:40.000]  why is the pharmaceutical industry
[2:06:40.000 --> 2:06:42.000]  top up vaccines
[2:06:42.000 --> 2:06:44.000]  they are making them.
[2:06:44.000 --> 2:06:46.000]  You should be terrified at this point as I am
[2:06:46.000 --> 2:06:48.000]  because there's absolutely
[2:06:48.000 --> 2:06:50.000]  no possible justification
[2:06:50.000 --> 2:06:52.000]  for their manufacture
[2:06:52.000 --> 2:06:54.000]  but they're being made and the world's
[2:06:54.000 --> 2:06:56.000]  medicines regulators have said
[2:06:56.000 --> 2:06:58.000]  because they're quite similar to the original
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:00.000]  vaccines the ones that are being given now
[2:07:00.000 --> 2:07:02.000]  we won't be asking them to do
[2:07:02.000 --> 2:07:04.000]  any clinical safety studies
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.000]  so let me just say again
[2:07:06.000 --> 2:07:08.000]  the variants are not different enough to represent a threat to you
[2:07:08.000 --> 2:07:10.000]  so you do not need to top up vaccines
[2:07:10.000 --> 2:07:12.000]  yet they are being made
[2:07:12.000 --> 2:07:14.000]  and the regulators have more or less
[2:07:14.000 --> 2:07:16.000]  waved them through.
[2:07:16.000 --> 2:07:18.000]  I'm very frightened of that
[2:07:18.000 --> 2:07:20.000]  there's no possible benign interpretation
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:22.000]  of this
[2:07:22.000 --> 2:07:24.000]  I believe that they're going to be used
[2:07:24.000 --> 2:07:26.000]  to damage your health and possibly kill you
[2:07:26.000 --> 2:07:28.000]  seriously. I can see
[2:07:28.000 --> 2:07:30.000]  no sensible interpretation
[2:07:30.000 --> 2:07:32.000]  other than a serious attempt
[2:07:32.000 --> 2:07:34.000]  at mass depopulation
[2:07:34.000 --> 2:07:36.000]  this will provide the tools to do it
[2:07:36.000 --> 2:07:38.000]  and plausible deniability
[2:07:38.000 --> 2:07:40.000]  because they'll create
[2:07:40.000 --> 2:07:42.000]  another story about some sort of biological
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:44.000]  threat and you'll line up
[2:07:44.000 --> 2:07:46.000]  and get your top up vaccines and a few months
[2:07:46.000 --> 2:07:48.000]  or a year or so later you'll die of some
[2:07:48.000 --> 2:07:50.000]  peculiar
[2:07:50.000 --> 2:07:52.000]  explicable syndrome
[2:07:52.000 --> 2:07:54.000]  and they won't be able to associate it with the top up vaccines
[2:07:54.000 --> 2:07:56.000]  but that's my belief
[2:07:56.000 --> 2:07:58.000]  that they're lying to you about variants
[2:07:58.000 --> 2:08:00.000]  so they can make damaging
[2:08:00.000 --> 2:08:02.000]  top up vaccines
[2:08:02.000 --> 2:08:04.000]  that you don't need at all
[2:08:04.000 --> 2:08:06.000]  to be used for malign purposes
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:08.000]  and if you don't wake up
[2:08:08.000 --> 2:08:10.000]  that's what's going to happen I think during next year
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:14.000]  well that's really scary and it's true
[2:08:14.000 --> 2:08:16.000]  it's Dr. Michael Edon
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:18.000]  former head of the technology division
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:20.000]  and the head scientist of respiratory viruses
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  at
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:24.000]  Pfizer
[2:08:24.000 --> 2:08:26.000]  and Dr. Robert Malone's the inventor
[2:08:26.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  of mRNA technology the first year and a half
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:30.000]  he's like maybe they're idiots
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:32.000]  maybe they don't know but this is going to hurt a lot of people
[2:08:32.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  if it's premeditated it's evil
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:36.000]  we've got to stop them because you cannot deny that
[2:08:36.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  I had Dr. Zelinko on
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:40.000]  time before last about a month ago
[2:08:40.000 --> 2:08:42.000]  and I'm not tooting our horn I'm saying we know what we're talking about
[2:08:42.000 --> 2:08:44.000]  please listen to us because I want to get out of this
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  with our lives I want you to get out of it as well
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  this is real
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:50.000]  it's the biggest threat in the last
[2:08:50.000 --> 2:08:52.000]  human development this is the biggest event ever
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:54.000]  I mean you cannot debate
[2:08:54.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  that this is like Hitler on steroids
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:08:58.000]  and
[2:08:58.000 --> 2:09:00.000]  that if we don't identify it's on purpose
[2:09:00.000 --> 2:09:02.000]  and if we don't identify these are war criminals
[2:09:02.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  and if we don't identify they cooked it up on purpose
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:06.000]  then they keep
[2:09:06.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  being able to debate us
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:10.000]  and argue little fine points
[2:09:10.000 --> 2:09:12.000]  and keep people distracted
[2:09:12.000 --> 2:09:14.000]  so that is not the point
[2:09:14.000 --> 2:09:16.000]  that we're making here
[2:09:16.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  this is not some accidental thing these aren't
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  just companies that
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:22.000]  mean well that screwed up and all this garbage
[2:09:22.000 --> 2:09:24.000]  these are individuals
[2:09:24.000 --> 2:09:26.000]  that are using this to take over the planet
[2:09:26.000 --> 2:09:28.000]  and it's in the great reset documents
[2:09:28.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  and it's an incredible time to be alive
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  so Dr.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  Zev Zalinko joins us here
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  he needs no introduction so much has happened
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:38.000]  he also issued an alert yesterday
[2:09:38.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  that if something happens to him
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  that he's not died of cancer
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  which he's fighting right now
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:46.000]  but it can be foul play
[2:09:46.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  I want to say the same thing I'm getting a lot of death threats right now
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:50.000]  we're not being dramatic folks
[2:09:50.000 --> 2:09:52.000]  we're at the tip of the spear exposing mass murderers
[2:09:52.000 --> 2:09:54.000]  this is a war
[2:09:54.000 --> 2:09:56.000]  and like Marshall McLuhan said 50 years ago
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  in the future
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  the war is going to be distributed to the general public
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:02.000]  it's not going to be main armies against each other
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:04.000]  so Dr. Zalinko so much going on so much happening
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:06.000]  thank you so much for joining us
[2:10:06.000 --> 2:10:08.000]  on this Thursday broadcast
[2:10:08.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  Hi Alex thanks again for having me
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:12.000]  I got a lot of questions
[2:10:12.000 --> 2:10:14.000]  and a lot to say and a lot to break down
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  and I want you to be able to take us where you want to go first
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:18.000]  so take us there
[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  and then I want to talk to you about Dr. Michael Yidon
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  who I know you talk a lot about
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:24.000]  getting even more hardcore now
[2:10:24.000 --> 2:10:26.000]  and basically aligning with what you and I are saying
[2:10:26.000 --> 2:10:28.000]  it isn't about us being right
[2:10:28.000 --> 2:10:30.000]  but I think it's key
[2:10:30.000 --> 2:10:32.000]  to really have people face what we're up against
[2:10:32.000 --> 2:10:34.000]  we have any chance of beating it
[2:10:34.000 --> 2:10:36.000]  we're going to win
[2:10:36.000 --> 2:10:38.000]  it's like someone who plays chess
[2:10:38.000 --> 2:10:40.000]  the better chess player you are
[2:10:40.000 --> 2:10:42.000]  the more moves ahead you can see
[2:10:42.000 --> 2:10:44.000]  and I see already that it's checkmate
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  the only question
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:48.000]  that's still a variable
[2:10:48.000 --> 2:10:50.000]  is how much carnage
[2:10:50.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  and what will be the body count of the innocent
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:54.000]  until we get to that point
[2:10:54.000 --> 2:10:56.000]  and the reason why I'm doing these interviews
[2:10:56.000 --> 2:10:58.000]  is that I hope that
[2:10:58.000 --> 2:11:00.000]  spreading the true narrative
[2:11:00.000 --> 2:11:02.000]  and giving people hope
[2:11:02.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  may mitigate
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:06.000]  or reduce the body count
[2:11:06.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  and so regarding Dr. Michael Yidon
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:10.000]  I know him personally
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:12.000]  he's a mentor of mine
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:14.000]  he's a brilliant scientist
[2:11:14.000 --> 2:11:16.000]  former vice president of Pfizer
[2:11:16.000 --> 2:11:18.000]  and he told me personally
[2:11:18.000 --> 2:11:20.000]  that for every one child
[2:11:20.000 --> 2:11:22.000]  100 die from the vaccine
[2:11:22.000 --> 2:11:24.000]  the vaccine is 100 times more lethal
[2:11:24.000 --> 2:11:26.000]  to
[2:11:26.000 --> 2:11:28.000]  children than the virus
[2:11:28.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  I think it's more than that
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:32.000]  but he has the statistics
[2:11:32.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  and the data analysis
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:36.000]  to prove that and he has actually
[2:11:36.000 --> 2:11:38.000]  presented that information to the world
[2:11:38.000 --> 2:11:40.000]  he's a man of integrity
[2:11:40.000 --> 2:11:42.000]  he has only what to lose
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  from coming out of retirement
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:46.000]  he's a very wealthy man
[2:11:46.000 --> 2:11:48.000]  he doesn't need all this aggravation
[2:11:48.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  but what I'm doing it
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:52.000]  is I believe that he's being motivated
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:54.000]  by altruism
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  and a genuine desire
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:11:58.000]  to protect
[2:11:58.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  people from carnage
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  now
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:04.000]  I think that it's extremely important
[2:12:04.000 --> 2:12:06.000]  to understand what is the
[2:12:06.000 --> 2:12:08.000]  motivation
[2:12:08.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  behind the
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  criminals and monsters that have done this
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  because and everything
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:16.000]  no one should believe a word I'm saying
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:18.000]  I provided for you
[2:12:18.000 --> 2:12:20.000]  resources
[2:12:20.000 --> 2:12:22.000]  and references to what I'm about to say
[2:12:22.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  much of which I'm sure you know
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:26.000]  but 30 years ago
[2:12:26.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  it became obvious to the people
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:30.000]  in power
[2:12:30.000 --> 2:12:32.000]  the wealthiest
[2:12:32.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  most powerful people in the planet
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:36.000]  that there was going to be a major catastrophe
[2:12:36.000 --> 2:12:38.000]  economically in 30 years
[2:12:38.000 --> 2:12:40.000]  there would be a collapse
[2:12:40.000 --> 2:12:42.000]  bankruptcy
[2:12:42.000 --> 2:12:44.000]  of the beginning
[2:12:44.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  of social security
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:48.000]  and Medicare and that's all known
[2:12:48.000 --> 2:12:50.000]  and Biden's recent policies
[2:12:50.000 --> 2:12:52.000]  of increased entitlements
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  have upped the date
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:56.000]  to the anticipated collapse
[2:12:56.000 --> 2:12:58.000]  2027, 2026
[2:12:58.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  used to be 2028
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:02.000]  that's the beginning and within 10 years
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:04.000]  there would be a complete bankruptcy
[2:13:04.000 --> 2:13:06.000]  that will have
[2:13:06.000 --> 2:13:08.000]  a tsunami effect
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  on the global economy
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:12.000]  and threatens the
[2:13:12.000 --> 2:13:14.000]  stakeholders their power
[2:13:14.000 --> 2:13:16.000]  and their wealth
[2:13:16.000 --> 2:13:18.000]  and control mechanisms
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:20.000]  over humanity
[2:13:20.000 --> 2:13:22.000]  which they've had cultivated over millennia
[2:13:22.000 --> 2:13:24.000]  we're talking about
[2:13:24.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  a force of
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:28.000]  evil
[2:13:28.000 --> 2:13:30.000]  that has always used
[2:13:30.000 --> 2:13:32.000]  human
[2:13:32.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  slavery
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:36.000]  as an asset
[2:13:36.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  slavery has always been
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  the most lucrative industry
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:42.000]  in the history of humanity
[2:13:42.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  and these people are amoral
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:46.000]  not immoral
[2:13:46.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  which means
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:50.000]  they are moral when it is expedient to them
[2:13:50.000 --> 2:13:52.000]  they're immoral when it is expedient to them
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  they support the Jews
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:13:56.000]  when it is expedient to them
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:13:58.000]  they support the Christians when it is useful to them
[2:13:58.000 --> 2:14:00.000]  and they instead the Jews against the Christians
[2:14:00.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  or vice versa when it is useful to them
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  they are capitalists when they need to be
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  they are communists when they need to be
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:08.000]  this level of
[2:14:08.000 --> 2:14:15.720]  transcends all of these systems that they have set and they play games and create chaos
[2:14:15.720 --> 2:14:20.560]  and geopolitical destabilization in order to promote their own agenda.
[2:14:20.560 --> 2:14:24.600]  In this particular case, it became obvious to everyone that there was going to be a huge
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:27.960]  economic collapse and they were threatened.
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:28.960]  What have they done?
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:35.360]  They've initiated a plan over the last 30 years that will result in when the system
[2:14:35.360 --> 2:14:45.160]  collapses and the dust settles, they will have the new financial infrastructure and
[2:14:45.160 --> 2:14:49.040]  control mechanisms to lead to the ultimate enslavement of humanity.
[2:14:49.040 --> 2:14:52.440]  And let me explain.
[2:14:52.440 --> 2:15:00.160]  In 2016, everyone knows, Klaus Schwab said that within 10 years, meaning by 2026, right
[2:15:00.160 --> 2:15:07.400]  before the anticipated collapse, 7 billion people will be tagged with a digital tracking
[2:15:07.400 --> 2:15:17.440]  device essentially, a biometric sensor that transmits biometric data with your location
[2:15:17.440 --> 2:15:19.000]  to a third party.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:20.520]  And it's not science fiction.
[2:15:20.520 --> 2:15:22.960]  There's a patent which we've spoken about several times.
[2:15:22.960 --> 2:15:27.120]  And he said on French TV, he said, first you'll wear it, then it'll be on the skin.
[2:15:27.120 --> 2:15:28.120]  Right.
[2:15:28.120 --> 2:15:31.320]  And that's Klaus Schwab saying that, and I have that video.
[2:15:31.320 --> 2:15:35.560]  But in addition to that, there's a patent, the two patents that go hand in hand.
[2:15:35.560 --> 2:15:41.640]  The one patent that says that the current vaccines have nanotechnology in them that
[2:15:41.640 --> 2:15:43.520]  allows them to measure your heart rate.
[2:15:43.520 --> 2:15:44.520]  Stay right there.
[2:15:44.520 --> 2:15:46.320]  I want to come right back to you.
[2:15:46.320 --> 2:15:47.320]  This is riveting information.
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:48.320]  How does the link go?
[2:15:48.320 --> 2:15:57.120]  Please stay with us.
[2:15:57.120 --> 2:16:03.600]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here.
[2:16:03.600 --> 2:16:07.440]  And that's what people recognize and resonate with.
[2:16:07.440 --> 2:16:10.920]  And as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for information.
[2:16:10.920 --> 2:16:12.560]  You might not agree with everything.
[2:16:12.560 --> 2:16:16.520]  You might not agree with all our perspectives, but we cover all the information.
[2:16:16.520 --> 2:16:18.760]  And there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[2:16:18.760 --> 2:16:20.200]  Thank you for that, Ward.
[2:16:20.200 --> 2:16:24.560]  Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions, Infowarsstore.com is where to
[2:16:24.560 --> 2:16:25.560]  get them, folks.
[2:16:25.560 --> 2:16:30.200]  We do have the best supplements, I mean, just like we try our best with our news coverage
[2:16:30.200 --> 2:16:35.400]  and our information, we do the best with our supplements as well.
[2:16:35.400 --> 2:16:39.080]  I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke.
[2:16:39.080 --> 2:16:42.440]  I mean, we're giving this thing away, it's 75% off.
[2:16:42.440 --> 2:16:45.000]  By the way, it works for me, in case you haven't noticed.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:49.040]  The hair and beard formula is working for me.
[2:16:49.040 --> 2:16:51.280]  Quite well, I might add.
[2:16:51.280 --> 2:16:55.080]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men.
[2:16:55.080 --> 2:16:57.240]  I go and see him quite often now.
[2:16:57.240 --> 2:17:02.440]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life.
[2:17:02.440 --> 2:17:08.840]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels, most men know that testosterone
[2:17:08.840 --> 2:17:15.280]  levels begin to decline, starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[2:17:15.280 --> 2:17:22.240]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.

[2:19:57.920 --> 2:20:09.440]  Leading of frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:09.440 --> 2:20:15.600]  Now I didn't talk to Dr. Zanliko before he came on air today, and I didn't tell him
[2:20:15.600 --> 2:20:20.600]  or talk about the great reset and engineered financial collapse and how swabs now, pre-programming
[2:20:20.600 --> 2:20:23.920]  is going to be a big cyber attack that they claim terrorists launched, you know, who will
[2:20:23.920 --> 2:20:24.920]  really launch it.
[2:20:24.920 --> 2:20:28.400]  And notice he just brought it up without us even asking because we're all synced up.
[2:20:28.400 --> 2:20:29.400]  That's God-consciousness.
[2:20:29.400 --> 2:20:31.440]  That's what scares the Satanist.
[2:20:31.440 --> 2:20:37.560]  He wrote an article titled, Government is the Enemy.
[2:20:37.560 --> 2:20:39.960]  What is really going on by Dr. Zanliko?
[2:20:39.960 --> 2:20:45.400]  So Dr., please continue, you got cut off by the break getting into.
[2:20:45.400 --> 2:20:48.320]  They know they've fraudulently created all those fractional reserve banking.
[2:20:48.320 --> 2:20:49.920]  They've created all these derivatives.
[2:20:49.920 --> 2:20:52.120]  They've taken the world over by it.
[2:20:52.120 --> 2:20:56.200]  It's a scam, so instead of them all going to jail, they've come up with a plan to collapse
[2:20:56.200 --> 2:21:01.240]  the world economy, pose as the saviors, and depopulate the useful cedars in the process,
[2:21:01.240 --> 2:21:05.880]  which is what so many corrupt feudal lords have done in the past, like the Aztecs and
[2:21:05.880 --> 2:21:07.880]  others when they want to feed their population.
[2:21:07.880 --> 2:21:08.880]  Please continue.
[2:21:08.880 --> 2:21:16.480]  Yeah, so the patent that I mentioned earlier gives the technology and the mechanism through
[2:21:16.480 --> 2:21:27.200]  which Klaus Schwab's prophecy, let's say, about 7 billion people having a digital identifier
[2:21:27.200 --> 2:21:34.120]  that connects them to a centralized network or grid or matrix is going to happen.
[2:21:34.120 --> 2:21:40.160]  The second patent that goes together with that is what Microsoft has from 2020.
[2:21:40.160 --> 2:21:49.160]  That patent describes the linkage of biometric data transmission to cryptocurrency.
[2:21:49.160 --> 2:21:51.760]  And so let me explain to you what that actually means.
[2:21:51.760 --> 2:21:59.040]  It means that in the future, let's say 2026 at a time, there'll be no more easy pass,
[2:21:59.040 --> 2:22:06.400]  there'll be no more Apple Pay, there'll be no more credit cards, it'll be biometric transactions.
[2:22:06.400 --> 2:22:13.720]  In other words, you are now injected with a technology that transmits your internal temperament
[2:22:13.720 --> 2:22:18.080]  and your internal data with your location to a third party.
[2:22:18.080 --> 2:22:22.600]  And that will allow you to, let's say, put your hand on a scanner and then walk out from
[2:22:22.600 --> 2:22:23.600]  the supermarket.
[2:22:23.600 --> 2:22:27.880]  So the hipsters think it's cool, but the problem with that is, what if I don't want to be part
[2:22:27.880 --> 2:22:28.880]  of the matrix?
[2:22:28.880 --> 2:22:33.880]  What if I don't want to be injected with a tracking technology?
[2:22:33.880 --> 2:22:37.760]  Well, then I would be excluded from the system of finance.
[2:22:37.760 --> 2:22:41.560]  I won't be able to buy bread, at least not probably on the black market, but I won't
[2:22:41.560 --> 2:22:43.400]  be able to buy bread for my family.
[2:22:43.400 --> 2:22:46.400]  So it's a control mechanism, it's the mark of the beast.
[2:22:46.400 --> 2:22:54.040]  In other words, if I don't participate in the system that they have created and control,
[2:22:54.040 --> 2:22:59.560]  I will be excluded from the ability to do transactions, financial transactions.
[2:22:59.560 --> 2:23:01.320]  So they don't have to put a bullet in my head.
[2:23:01.320 --> 2:23:06.640]  They just have to prevent my ability to buy food for my family.
[2:23:06.640 --> 2:23:11.480]  And that's like the social credit system in China, where basically they could set a radius
[2:23:11.480 --> 2:23:14.560]  through which I can't go out of my house or put me on house arrest.
[2:23:14.560 --> 2:23:15.560]  They know my location.
[2:23:15.560 --> 2:23:22.640]  I step out out of my permitted radius, let's say, and they turn off my ability to do finance.
[2:23:22.640 --> 2:23:25.480]  So this is a control mechanism.
[2:23:25.480 --> 2:23:33.160]  And the entire crisis here has nothing to do with medicine, has nothing to do with health.
[2:23:33.160 --> 2:23:36.920]  They're fools on this planet right now who actually think that the governing parties
[2:23:36.920 --> 2:23:41.160]  actually care about your well-being, and there's no hope for you.
[2:23:41.160 --> 2:23:46.440]  But the reality is that COVID-19 is a weapon of mass destruction, it was made in a laboratory,
[2:23:46.440 --> 2:23:47.440]  no one denies that.
[2:23:47.440 --> 2:23:52.160]  And I want to tell you something, Alex, I don't know if you realize that Ralph Barrick,
[2:23:52.160 --> 2:23:56.580]  Dr. Barrick, was involved in every step of the development of this viral weapon and converting
[2:23:56.580 --> 2:23:59.640]  it to a human virus.
[2:23:59.640 --> 2:24:05.120]  He took a bad coronavirus, changed some things on it, got a patent for it, and technology
[2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:11.520]  to convert it to a human virus, then Dr. Barrick and Zheng Li and Wuhan funded by the NIH,
[2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:15.960]  they published a paper thanking the NIH, figured out how to augment the lethality of this virus
[2:24:15.960 --> 2:24:16.960]  to destroy human lung tissue.
[2:24:16.960 --> 2:24:22.920]  Which was key because Fauci wanted his HIV protein to be part of it so he could pay.
[2:24:22.920 --> 2:24:30.440]  Yes, but here's something you may not know, that in March of 2020, I came across data,
[2:24:30.440 --> 2:24:36.120]  papers that helped me formulate my treatment approach based on zinc and zinc ionophores,
[2:24:36.120 --> 2:24:38.640]  which is what the Z-SAC concept is.
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:44.480]  What I didn't realize until last week was that Ralph Barrick published that paper, processed
[2:24:44.480 --> 2:24:45.480]  that.
[2:24:45.480 --> 2:24:51.920]  In other words, the guy who made the bomb also created the antidote to defuse the bomb funded
[2:24:51.920 --> 2:24:52.920]  by the government.
[2:24:52.920 --> 2:24:53.920]  Incredible.
[2:24:53.920 --> 2:24:58.640]  Start over, say that again, that is, I did not know that, this is groundbreaking.
[2:24:58.640 --> 2:25:02.000]  Explain, oh my, you're a big researcher, that's how you found these treatments somebody
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:03.000]  else had.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:06.360]  And then when you found the research paper, it's the guy that was engineering it all
[2:25:06.360 --> 2:25:11.040]  out of Chapel Hill, North Carolina with Obama, with Fauci moving it, this is so huge, please
[2:25:11.040 --> 2:25:12.040]  start over.
[2:25:12.040 --> 2:25:16.400]  And by the way, on your Skype is a link to that paper.
[2:25:16.400 --> 2:25:22.000]  Everything I'm saying, I have evidence for, and it should be presented because otherwise
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:23.000]  it won't be believed.
[2:25:23.000 --> 2:25:25.720]  Yes, sir, we'll either put it on screen, we'll put it in post later once this is archived.
[2:25:25.720 --> 2:25:27.280]  Please start over, this is huge.
[2:25:27.280 --> 2:25:28.480]  All right, fine.
[2:25:28.480 --> 2:25:35.160]  So Ralph Barrick in 1999 did research at the University of Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:41.560]  He was able to manipulate a bad animal virus, a bad coronavirus, converted by modulating
[2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:44.480]  a surface protein to infect human beings.
[2:25:44.480 --> 2:25:48.280]  But it was still benign, it was just infecting human beings then.
[2:25:48.280 --> 2:25:56.760]  And then in 2010, the same Ralph Barrick figure out a way to diffuse coronaviruses by using
[2:25:56.760 --> 2:26:02.200]  zinc and zinc ion, of course, inhibiting RNA dependent RNA polymerase or inhibiting
[2:26:02.200 --> 2:26:05.720]  a coronavirus replication.
[2:26:05.720 --> 2:26:11.880]  In 2015, and by the way, everything's here being funded by the United States government,
[2:26:11.880 --> 2:26:16.000]  because it's on the papers, and on the peer reviewed papers, they thank the United States
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:18.960]  government, NIH or whatever, for the funding.
[2:26:18.960 --> 2:26:26.880]  Then in 2015, in Wuhan, Barrick, together in collaboration with Dr. Zheng Li, the bad
[2:26:26.880 --> 2:26:33.920]  lady, they were able to figure out a way to augment the payload of this weapon to destroy
[2:26:33.920 --> 2:26:37.120]  human lung tissue and cause blood clots.
[2:26:37.120 --> 2:26:42.560]  They wrote a paper about it, they thanked the NIH, they published it, and they got patents
[2:26:42.560 --> 2:26:43.560]  on it.
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:45.440]  And here's another layer to the story.
[2:26:45.440 --> 2:26:53.960]  The same Ralph Barrick worked with the team from Gilead Pharmaceuticals to make remdesivir.
[2:26:53.960 --> 2:26:56.000]  Which destroys the kidneys and doesn't help you.
[2:26:56.000 --> 2:26:57.400]  This is so diabolical.
[2:26:57.400 --> 2:27:00.800]  So every way you can see the criminal pre-planning.
[2:27:00.800 --> 2:27:02.360]  Yes.
[2:27:02.360 --> 2:27:09.400]  And so, this is a bio-web, and they had the antidote for it.
[2:27:09.400 --> 2:27:13.360]  And they suppressed the antidote intentionally, and that's for themselves.
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:18.120]  You think these masterminds want their own families to die?
[2:27:18.120 --> 2:27:19.120]  Of course not.
[2:27:19.120 --> 2:27:24.160]  They themselves know, this is consistent with what I knew about the executives of...
[2:27:24.160 --> 2:27:28.800]  Yeah, you broke that a year ago, and Joe Rogan confirmed it, that hundreds of members of
[2:27:28.800 --> 2:27:34.480]  Congress in Hollywood all know about this, but still want to suppress that your protocol,
[2:27:34.480 --> 2:27:37.640]  they were using your protocol, but they suppress it for the general public.
[2:27:37.640 --> 2:27:38.640]  Talk about evil.
[2:27:38.640 --> 2:27:45.000]  Yeah, also the executives of Google, I know internally that they're all taking hydroxychloroquine
[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:46.480]  and ivermectin.
[2:27:46.480 --> 2:27:53.520]  And so, this information, the antidote to the bomb, the poison, was known, was created
[2:27:53.520 --> 2:27:59.760]  by the same monsters, but they hid it from you and me.
[2:27:59.760 --> 2:28:07.400]  Now, when doctors like myself stumbled across these approaches, because we had a necessity
[2:28:07.400 --> 2:28:12.040]  for patients who died, and so we needed some help, we needed to help, we needed to treat
[2:28:12.040 --> 2:28:13.040]  the patients.
[2:28:13.040 --> 2:28:19.280]  And so, immediately, anything that would help hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin, and even
[2:28:19.280 --> 2:28:24.600]  the concept of early intervention, getting rid of this infection before the complications
[2:28:24.600 --> 2:28:31.240]  begin, everything was vilified, marginalized, and doctors that were advocating for it were
[2:28:31.240 --> 2:28:32.240]  deplatformed.
[2:28:32.240 --> 2:28:36.040]  So, when you laid out those, they knew it, they had it planned, they censored it, they
[2:28:36.040 --> 2:28:37.040]  did it all.
[2:28:37.040 --> 2:28:52.840]  And so, when you laid out those, they knew it, they did it all, they did it all, they
[2:28:52.840 --> 2:28:57.320]  did it all.
[2:28:57.320 --> 2:29:16.360]  July 4th, 2022 Super Sale is live and only running for one week exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[2:29:16.360 --> 2:29:20.440]  This is the biggest sale yet of the year, some of these products we're selling at below
[2:29:20.440 --> 2:29:25.000]  cost, you've got to move them out of the warehouse to be able to continue to stay on the air.

[2:29:45.360 --> 2:29:50.760]  and celebrate July 4th, 1776, part two against the New World Order.
[2:29:50.760 --> 2:29:57.600]  Because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:29:57.600 --> 2:30:00.960]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[2:30:00.960 --> 2:30:05.280]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[2:30:05.280 --> 2:30:10.000]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[2:30:10.000 --> 2:30:14.480]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[2:30:14.480 --> 2:30:19.280]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[2:30:19.280 --> 2:30:25.040]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[2:30:25.040 --> 2:30:31.040]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[2:30:31.040 --> 2:30:37.680]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[2:30:37.680 --> 2:30:42.280]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[2:30:42.280 --> 2:30:48.040]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[2:30:48.040 --> 2:30:50.840]  facts that pertain to reality.
[2:30:50.840 --> 2:31:19.840]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.

[2:32:47.320 --> 2:32:58.320]  With one of nature's greatest treasures in vasobeat from Infowar's life today.
[2:32:58.320 --> 2:33:18.280]  Taking a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:18.280 --> 2:33:23.120]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Dr. Zalinko.
[2:33:23.120 --> 2:33:28.860]  And again, I would apologize for 14 minutes of ads an hour, but that's the standard for
[2:33:28.860 --> 2:33:32.040]  talk radio and TV, and I hate going to break with Dr. Zalinko saying something so important,
[2:33:32.040 --> 2:33:37.800]  but it's all hard, it's all hard wired in by the satellite feeds that literally cut
[2:33:37.800 --> 2:33:38.800]  into the radio stations.
[2:33:38.800 --> 2:33:44.200]  That's why the platforming off the internet, we said on air, we had over 200 radio stations,
[2:33:44.200 --> 2:33:45.200]  and we still do.
[2:33:45.200 --> 2:33:49.080]  We're very thankful to those stations, but I am going to start the new year three nights
[2:33:49.080 --> 2:33:55.040]  a week, at least three nights a week, a multi-hour commercial free podcast, direct to you the
[2:33:55.040 --> 2:33:59.200]  viewers and listeners with guests and callers, where I might take a break to go to the bathroom
[2:33:59.200 --> 2:34:02.280]  or get a cup of coffee or something, but it's not going to have regular commercial breaks,
[2:34:02.280 --> 2:34:05.080]  so look for that in the new year, something I promise to do.
[2:34:05.080 --> 2:34:09.040]  The world's so crazy we're here, but Dr. Zalinko, I know our listeners are smart, they're awesome
[2:34:09.040 --> 2:34:11.480]  people, but I want them to get what you're saying.
[2:34:11.480 --> 2:34:16.400]  You're laying out any grand jury, it would take a few weeks to give a grand jury all
[2:34:16.400 --> 2:34:19.280]  this, but they would definitely indict Fauci for what you're saying.
[2:34:19.280 --> 2:34:24.560]  You're laying out the compendium of basically how this criminal plan was set up, and when
[2:34:24.560 --> 2:34:28.000]  you see how criminal it was, like you were saying last time you were on, months before
[2:34:28.000 --> 2:34:33.480]  the outbreak, Gates and Fauci are already sending messages saying, get the vaccine ready.
[2:34:33.480 --> 2:34:37.680]  You're like, wait, they didn't make the vaccine, no, they owned the patents to what vaccine
[2:34:37.680 --> 2:34:41.720]  they, quote, wanted to then be sent out to the major makers, which they also got paid
[2:34:41.720 --> 2:34:42.720]  money from.
[2:34:42.720 --> 2:34:48.680]  The trail, I think it's what you're saying, of them scientifically preparing this is one
[2:34:48.680 --> 2:34:54.080]  of the most open and shut premeditated murder cases ever, is that what you're saying?
[2:34:54.080 --> 2:34:56.680]  I'm saying this is the worst crime in human history.
[2:34:56.680 --> 2:35:04.600]  It's genocide, it's mass murder, first degree premeditated genocide and mass murder, and
[2:35:04.600 --> 2:35:14.920]  it's being driven essentially by demonic personalities that are absolutely obsessed with power and
[2:35:14.920 --> 2:35:19.760]  wealth, but more than wealth, I think it's power, because once you have $100 billion,
[2:35:19.760 --> 2:35:22.080]  let's say, what's the difference if you have $150 billion?
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:29.160]  You don't feel it, but power and being able to enslave others, it fulfills the perverse
[2:35:29.160 --> 2:35:37.760]  desires of these narcissists, egotists, and really, I would even call them Satan incarnate
[2:35:37.760 --> 2:35:41.400]  or the embodiment of the essence of evil.
[2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:46.000]  And I actually want to, do you know who Barbara Marx Hubbard was?
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  Yes.
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:51.160]  Okay, she is the demonic mother of the New World Order.
[2:35:51.160 --> 2:35:55.880]  She, I hope she burns in hell for all eternity, she, and I'm going to read you a few quotes
[2:35:55.880 --> 2:36:02.960]  from her that will explain to you the philosophy, she's the ideology, the mother of the ideology
[2:36:02.960 --> 2:36:09.200]  of Klaus Schwab, let's say, one fourth of humanity must be eliminated from the social
[2:36:09.200 --> 2:36:10.200]  body.
[2:36:10.200 --> 2:36:19.520]  It's a quote, we are in charge of God's selection process for planet Earth, he selects, we destroy,
[2:36:19.520 --> 2:36:28.640]  we are the writers of the pale horse death, end quote, another quote from her, this act
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:32.040]  is as horrible as killing a cancer cell.
[2:36:32.040 --> 2:36:39.360]  It must be done for the sake of the future of the whole, so be it, prepared for the selection
[2:36:39.360 --> 2:36:46.600]  process, which is now beginning, we, the elders have been patiently waiting until the very
[2:36:46.600 --> 2:36:55.200]  last moment before the quantum transformation to take action to cut out this corrupted and
[2:36:55.200 --> 2:36:59.760]  corrupting element in the human, in the body of humanity.
[2:36:59.760 --> 2:37:05.920]  It is like watching a cancer grow, something must be done before the whole body is destroyed.
[2:37:05.920 --> 2:37:11.760]  The destructive one fourth must be eliminated from the social body.
[2:37:11.760 --> 2:37:18.760]  I want to read you one more quote, not from her, from, his name is Jacques Attali, he
[2:37:18.760 --> 2:37:27.320]  was the advisor to the French prime minister from 1981 till, till in the 90s, I think 1991.
[2:37:27.320 --> 2:37:32.040]  You know, François Mitterrand, who was a big Luciferian, please continue.
[2:37:32.040 --> 2:37:39.640]  Yes, so he was Mitterrand's right-hand man, and this was from a book called Verbatum in
[2:37:39.640 --> 2:37:40.640]  1981.
[2:37:40.640 --> 2:37:49.480]  Now, the Facebook fact checker, myth, busters or myth, whatever it's called, says that this
[2:37:49.480 --> 2:37:50.480]  isn't true.
[2:37:50.480 --> 2:37:54.000]  So this is how I know that this, this must be true.
[2:37:54.000 --> 2:37:58.720]  The future will be about finding a way to reduce the population.
[2:37:58.720 --> 2:38:02.880]  Of course, we will not be able to execute people or build camps.
[2:38:02.880 --> 2:38:07.040]  We get rid of them by making them believe it is for their own good.
[2:38:07.040 --> 2:38:14.680]  We'll find or cause something at pandemic, targeting certain people, a real economic
[2:38:14.680 --> 2:38:21.120]  crisis or not, a virus affecting the old or the elderly, it doesn't matter.
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:24.800]  The weak and the fearful will succumb to it.
[2:38:24.800 --> 2:38:28.840]  The stupid will believe in it and ask to be treated.
[2:38:28.840 --> 2:38:37.840]  We will have taken care of having panned the treatment, a treatment that will be the solution.
[2:38:37.840 --> 2:38:43.440]  The selection of idiots will therefore be done by itself.
[2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:46.400]  They will go to the slaughterhouse alone.
[2:38:46.400 --> 2:38:47.400]  Wow.
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:51.960]  Dr. Zellinger, let me just say this, because this is about God-consciousness, and I don't
[2:38:51.960 --> 2:38:55.160]  say something that isn't true, but it's a little embarrassing to say just because it's
[2:38:55.160 --> 2:38:56.160]  so personal.
[2:38:56.160 --> 2:39:00.440]  You normally, it takes about a week to get you on the show, today you were able to come
[2:39:00.440 --> 2:39:01.440]  on.
[2:39:01.440 --> 2:39:04.440]  I had a dream about you last night, but I couldn't remember the dream when I woke up.
[2:39:04.440 --> 2:39:08.960]  When I got up, I said, I got to get Zalinko on today, and then I said, what was the dream
[2:39:08.960 --> 2:39:09.960]  about?
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:10.960]  I couldn't remember.
[2:39:10.960 --> 2:39:14.400]  And then I just remembered that, I said to myself, well, Zalinko kind of says the same
[2:39:14.400 --> 2:39:17.520]  thing every time he's on, just like you do, it's not an attack, it's true.
[2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:20.320]  Same emergency message, but I said, no, today's going to be different.
[2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:24.960]  And then I intended to come in here and talk about the population, talk about the you and
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:30.680]  talk about Schwab, and talk about, she wasn't even by name, but those same groups.
[2:39:30.680 --> 2:39:35.440]  And then here you said it, this is amazing, and I'm not trying to be weird about it, it's
[2:39:35.440 --> 2:39:36.440]  just true.
[2:39:36.440 --> 2:39:39.080]  So I feel like I should have said that, go ahead.
[2:39:39.080 --> 2:39:44.880]  Listen, truth is truth, it's a certain, it's in the air, you know, and people that are
[2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:50.880]  attuned to it, I think it's become much more accessible to anyone who wants to access and
[2:39:50.880 --> 2:39:55.120]  download this information, not talking about metaphysically, that there's an intuitive sense
[2:39:55.120 --> 2:39:56.640]  of what's true and what's not.
[2:39:56.640 --> 2:40:04.640]  Anyone who has some degree of sensitivity sees that this is an attempt by the forces
[2:40:04.640 --> 2:40:13.960]  of evil to steal God's consciousness and then use fear to breed codependency and occult,
[2:40:13.960 --> 2:40:19.240]  codependency on sociopaths and corrupt governments, and a belief in the golden calf of these like
[2:40:19.240 --> 2:40:20.240]  false promises.
[2:40:20.240 --> 2:40:23.800]  So God knows evils coming after us and God's opened the floodgates, that's what I feel
[2:40:23.800 --> 2:40:24.800]  actually.
[2:40:24.800 --> 2:40:28.240]  I mean, my discernment is way more powerful than it used to be, are you seeing the same
[2:40:28.240 --> 2:40:29.240]  thing?
[2:40:29.240 --> 2:40:35.160]  But yeah, but I see it actually in a different way, that I see that God is giving every human
[2:40:35.160 --> 2:40:42.080]  being an opportunity, it's like we're in the generation right before the flood of Noah,
[2:40:42.080 --> 2:40:48.520]  and God is saying, listen, repent and get on the ark, don't stay in the turbulent waters
[2:40:48.520 --> 2:40:51.360]  of idol worship and child sacrifice and paganism.
[2:40:51.360 --> 2:41:00.920]  You see, it's the decisions of man, if you know there's a psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, he
[2:41:00.920 --> 2:41:08.200]  wrote that the degradation of a society begins with the moral degradation of an individual.
[2:41:08.200 --> 2:41:12.040]  And so you can learn vice versa, that the moral improvement of a society begins with
[2:41:12.040 --> 2:41:14.320]  the refinement of the individual.
[2:41:14.320 --> 2:41:20.240]  And so it's the sum total of all of our bad decisions over the last whatever period of
[2:41:20.240 --> 2:41:27.680]  time that has led to the slaughter of the unborn, the defamation and desecration of gender roles,
[2:41:27.680 --> 2:41:36.600]  the desecration of what marriage is, the perversion and poisoning of the youth through the public
[2:41:36.600 --> 2:41:43.280]  school system, which teaches debauchery and normalizes the worst behavior, immoral behavior.
[2:41:43.280 --> 2:41:48.800]  So basically this country has drifted away from Judeo-Christian morals, and let's just
[2:41:48.800 --> 2:41:50.600]  keep it simple, the Tank commandment.
[2:41:50.600 --> 2:41:56.160]  And so therefore, it's not surprising to me that there comes a kind of a tipping point
[2:41:56.160 --> 2:42:01.360]  that's crossed, the threshold that's been passed through collective humanity, where
[2:42:01.360 --> 2:42:04.800]  God says, okay, now it's time for a cleaning.
[2:42:04.800 --> 2:42:06.280]  And I think that's what we're going through.
[2:42:06.280 --> 2:42:16.320]  And maybe the best result here is people repent, they return back to the umbrella of the divine
[2:42:16.320 --> 2:42:22.560]  will, they live a moral life, they respect life, the sanctity of life, they respect marriage,
[2:42:22.560 --> 2:42:26.160]  they respect children and the unborn and so on.
[2:42:26.160 --> 2:42:30.080]  And that could avert a major body count.
[2:42:30.080 --> 2:42:37.360]  Or regardless of whether or not people are going to realize that the cleansing will happen.
[2:42:37.360 --> 2:42:43.200]  And so what it's, again, every single individual right now is being given a choice, and that
[2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:45.400]  choice is from God.
[2:42:45.400 --> 2:42:47.400]  And here's the question, who are you going to bow down to?
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:51.400]  I agree, stay right there, there's no final segment, talk about solutions straight ahead,

[2:43:56.560 --> 2:43:59.080]  while you're there.
[2:43:59.080 --> 2:44:03.040]  Sleepless nights seem to be a lot more common these days with everything that's going
[2:44:03.040 --> 2:44:05.880]  on both at home and the world at large.
[2:44:05.880 --> 2:44:11.120]  If you're having trouble getting to that deep sleep we could all use more of, our new Sleep
[2:44:11.120 --> 2:44:15.160]  Support Formula, down and out, is just the thing.
[2:44:15.160 --> 2:44:19.880]  It's our new faster-absorbing liquid formula that is specifically designed to help you
[2:44:19.880 --> 2:44:22.680]  get the shut-eye you deserve.
[2:44:22.680 --> 2:44:26.920]  Formulated to improve upon our best-selling product, Knockout, with down and out, now
[2:44:26.920 --> 2:44:32.600]  the herbs and melatonin packed inside are extracted directly into the glycerin solution,
[2:44:32.600 --> 2:44:37.080]  so the ingredients are already dissolved into the formula before you even take it.
[2:44:37.080 --> 2:44:42.280]  One of the other Sleep Support herbs included is the Passion Flour, which was traditionally
[2:44:42.280 --> 2:44:48.000]  used by Native Americans like the Cherokees, who used it for its relaxing qualities.
[2:44:48.000 --> 2:44:52.280]  Be sure to take this product when you are completely ready for sleep, because you will
[2:44:52.280 --> 2:44:54.240]  be down and out.
[2:44:54.240 --> 2:44:57.720]  Selling out now at www.IVWarsTour.com.
[2:44:57.720 --> 2:45:04.480]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[2:45:04.480 --> 2:45:06.480]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[2:45:06.480 --> 2:45:07.480]  It is.
[2:45:07.480 --> 2:45:11.960]  But if you tuck it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[2:45:11.960 --> 2:45:13.120]  The fish oil is better than that.
[2:45:13.120 --> 2:45:15.200]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[2:45:15.200 --> 2:45:20.840]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[2:45:20.840 --> 2:45:23.560]  Crill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps.
[2:45:23.560 --> 2:45:24.560]  And I'm just sorry.
[2:45:24.560 --> 2:45:26.360]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[2:45:26.360 --> 2:45:29.440]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[2:45:29.440 --> 2:45:31.640]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something.
[2:45:31.640 --> 2:45:34.440]  I eat five capillots of krill oil before I go to bed.
[2:45:34.440 --> 2:45:37.960]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[2:45:37.960 --> 2:45:45.440]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[2:45:45.440 --> 2:45:48.880]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you know what, I just obsess, because whatever
[2:45:48.880 --> 2:45:51.280]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:52.680]  I just can't do it.
[2:45:52.680 --> 2:45:57.960]  In Force 4.
[2:45:57.960 --> 2:46:04.440]  At this point, best case scenario is a few years of hard times for us all.
[2:46:04.440 --> 2:46:08.640]  If we don't turn it around soon, then it will only get worse.
[2:46:08.640 --> 2:46:14.400]  But as bad as things are, we still have time to prepare, and that alone is something to
[2:46:14.400 --> 2:46:15.880]  be grateful for.
[2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:21.360]  A gravity water filter will provide you with clean, healthy water, even in the event of
[2:46:21.360 --> 2:46:23.840]  your taps getting shut off.
[2:46:23.840 --> 2:46:29.360]  And having your own food will save you from getting ensnared in government FEMA camps.
[2:46:29.360 --> 2:46:33.800]  And if you've already stocked up enough for your own family, you might want to consider
[2:46:33.800 --> 2:46:36.640]  stocking up for your neighbors.
[2:46:36.640 --> 2:46:42.120]  Some of your neighbors might not be prepared for what's coming, but you can help them by
[2:46:42.120 --> 2:46:47.040]  having an abundance of storable foods and water filtration.
[2:46:47.040 --> 2:46:51.880]  Whoever sews bountifully will also reap bountifully.
[2:46:51.880 --> 2:46:58.360]  Stock up now at PrepareToday.com.
[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:05.360]  Seeding a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[2:47:28.360 --> 2:47:43.360]  I want to talk about where we're going here, because everything Satan does is a counterfeit.
[2:47:43.360 --> 2:47:47.120]  And so Satan says, oh, I'm going to call the people, I'm going to make them make the decision,
[2:47:47.120 --> 2:47:52.160]  I'm going to make them decide which side they're on, but then, really, that's God's
[2:47:52.160 --> 2:47:53.160]  plan.
[2:47:53.160 --> 2:47:56.680]  It's up to us individually to choose, not for Satan to make those choices for us.
[2:47:56.680 --> 2:48:03.200]  Here's Jack Pasobak, who's a smart guy, pretty clear Biden is only crediting Trump for the
[2:48:03.200 --> 2:48:06.600]  vaccine to set him up to take the blame for what comes next.
[2:48:06.600 --> 2:48:11.600]  I think that's a very simple, neutral way to say it, and now Trump is rubbing it in
[2:48:11.600 --> 2:48:15.560]  after speeches in Texas saying, take the shot, it's totally safe, it totally works.
[2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:16.560]  None of that's true.
[2:48:16.560 --> 2:48:20.920]  Trump says most Americans dying are unvaccinated and encourages everyone to get the shot.
[2:48:20.920 --> 2:48:24.400]  Now, he loved Dr. Zelinko's protocol, help promote it.
[2:48:24.400 --> 2:48:27.600]  I think Trump just thinks doctors are trustworthy.
[2:48:27.600 --> 2:48:31.080]  He hasn't heard of Joseph Mengele, and I'm sorry to bring up a Nazi analogy, but it's
[2:48:31.080 --> 2:48:33.400]  the one that fits here, Dr. Zelinko.
[2:48:33.400 --> 2:48:37.960]  I think Trump's a good person, but I'm really worried about him with what he's doing here.
[2:48:37.960 --> 2:48:39.120]  I think he's being set up.
[2:48:39.120 --> 2:48:42.120]  What do you think?
[2:48:42.120 --> 2:48:47.640]  Whatever his motivations are, I have to publicly disagree with him.
[2:48:47.640 --> 2:48:49.400]  I think he's done a lot of good.
[2:48:49.400 --> 2:48:53.960]  I would say the main thing they did that was good was move the federal judiciary toward
[2:48:53.960 --> 2:49:01.040]  the right with more than 300 justices that have Judeo-Christian values.
[2:49:01.040 --> 2:49:06.160]  I think that did help move the country, the moral compass of this country.
[2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:09.280]  What he's talking about when it comes to these vaccines, he really doesn't know what
[2:49:09.280 --> 2:49:10.280]  he's talking about.
[2:49:10.280 --> 2:49:16.280]  If he does, then I have a real problem with him because he's worried about his legacy.
[2:49:16.280 --> 2:49:22.280]  He's a narcissist, and what he cares about now is his legacy.
[2:49:22.280 --> 2:49:29.760]  He went warp speed due to political calculations, this I know for a fact, but he was looking
[2:49:29.760 --> 2:49:35.080]  into pre-hospital treatments and emphasizing that until hydroxychlorophenobit became politically
[2:49:35.080 --> 2:49:36.080]  radioactive.
[2:49:36.080 --> 2:49:41.880]  Then he made a calculation, or his team got that advice in my, for short, that shifted
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:46.680]  him towards a warp speed, the vaccine development, because he thought that was going to help him
[2:49:46.680 --> 2:49:52.560]  win reelection, and then he went after, he secured his second term, go back to pre-hospital.
[2:49:52.560 --> 2:49:58.000]  I was told pre-hospital treatment.
[2:49:58.000 --> 2:50:06.000]  The reality is that the vaccines were known, the side effects were known, and the FDA knew
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:14.440]  about it, and months before they released this poisonous deftron on innocent humanity.
[2:50:14.440 --> 2:50:15.440]  That's right.
[2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:20.480]  You got you up, October FDA CDC documents said they knew all these things would happen
[2:50:20.480 --> 2:50:21.480]  that did happen.
[2:50:21.480 --> 2:50:22.480]  Please continue.
[2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:27.600]  Slide number 16, yeah, that's exactly what I was referring to.
[2:50:27.600 --> 2:50:28.600]  He has a choice.
[2:50:28.600 --> 2:50:31.480]  I still hope that he chooses the right thing.
[2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:39.160]  I think that the deep state operatives like Rick Bright and Janet Woodcock, and I have
[2:50:39.160 --> 2:50:44.600]  evidence for all that, sabotage his plan when he gave an order to make hydroxychloroquine
[2:50:44.600 --> 2:50:50.560]  available to all Americans, they spun it and issued an emergency use authorization that
[2:50:50.560 --> 2:50:53.880]  blocked access to patients that are not in the hospital.
[2:50:53.880 --> 2:51:00.040]  Exactly the opposite of what his intent was, and that killed 700 million people.
[2:51:00.040 --> 2:51:02.400]  Exactly, so how does Trump extricate himself?
[2:51:02.400 --> 2:51:04.400]  Because of hundreds of thousands of people.
[2:51:04.400 --> 2:51:07.160]  I mean, how does Trump not be set up here?
[2:51:07.160 --> 2:51:12.920]  Well, he has to recognize that he was sabotaged, but forget about him, the American people
[2:51:12.920 --> 2:51:13.920]  were sabotaged.
[2:51:13.920 --> 2:51:18.760]  The interests of the American people, the lives and the sanctity of the lives, our lives
[2:51:18.760 --> 2:51:26.520]  are desecrated, and so the only position that he has is to backtrack and say, yes, I had
[2:51:26.520 --> 2:51:33.880]  my intuition initially was correct, the pre-hospital approach is the right approach, and now we
[2:51:33.880 --> 2:51:38.600]  see the evidence of these vaccines, they don't work, and they're dangerous, and most people
[2:51:38.600 --> 2:51:39.600]  don't need them.
[2:51:39.600 --> 2:51:46.560]  So I'm pivoting now for the welfare of the American public and supporting proven data-driven
[2:51:46.560 --> 2:51:53.400]  solutions and not force people to go on a path of self-destruction.
[2:51:53.400 --> 2:51:57.840]  He has to do me a favor, he has to say, I'm sorry, I made a mistake, and that's okay.
[2:51:57.840 --> 2:52:01.200]  I totally agree, Dr. Zalinko, and that's what I've been saying, because I know he got set
[2:52:01.200 --> 2:52:07.040]  up and sucked in, but the deeper he gets sucked into this, it's a major setup.
[2:52:07.040 --> 2:52:11.200]  In the time we have left, the rest of this segment, one more short segment with you,
[2:52:11.200 --> 2:52:12.520]  what do you predict for next year?
[2:52:12.520 --> 2:52:15.720]  I mean, clearly they're lining up, they're saying, Trump supporters are going to launch
[2:52:15.720 --> 2:52:20.640]  terror attacks, the CIA, his globalist control, they're wanting all this, they're trying to
[2:52:20.640 --> 2:52:23.720]  divide and conquer us along all lines.
[2:52:23.720 --> 2:52:27.560]  In fact, I was intending today, that was on my heart to bring up how they're trying to
[2:52:27.560 --> 2:52:31.240]  divide Christian from Jew, and to get your take, but I didn't want to bring that up,
[2:52:31.240 --> 2:52:33.040]  and then you brought it up yourself.
[2:52:33.040 --> 2:52:36.640]  Clearly we're all God's children, we all have God consciousness if we choose it, they're
[2:52:36.640 --> 2:52:41.520]  trying to play us off against each other, we have to transcend that in my mind or in
[2:52:41.520 --> 2:52:46.160]  my spirit, or we're going to fail, because clearly they're going to use division going
[2:52:46.160 --> 2:52:49.320]  into the future along race and religion to control us.
[2:52:49.320 --> 2:52:55.840]  So listen, I've been pretty savvy and I know, listen, I love you Alex, you should know,
[2:52:55.840 --> 2:52:57.200]  I consider you a brother.
[2:52:57.200 --> 2:53:02.640]  A lot of the, some of the people that listen to you have an interesting view on Jews, but
[2:53:02.640 --> 2:53:10.440]  I'm going to say something about my own religion and about my own religious institutions and
[2:53:10.440 --> 2:53:15.400]  to the anti-Semites that are going to use these words, F you, okay, why don't you look
[2:53:15.400 --> 2:53:20.200]  into your own organizations and religious structures and refine them, but I would say
[2:53:20.200 --> 2:53:26.800]  in my own religion, it's the organizations that are the problem, they have been corrupted
[2:53:26.800 --> 2:53:34.720]  by the serpent and have preached anything but God's consciousness, and are coercing
[2:53:34.720 --> 2:53:40.280]  people, I know synagogue, you can't go into a synagogue unless you show proof of vaccination.
[2:53:40.280 --> 2:53:45.840]  I mean, this is the perversion of a relationship with the divine.
[2:53:45.840 --> 2:53:51.200]  And so, and I see that in other religions as well, but I don't want to talk about other
[2:53:51.200 --> 2:53:56.880]  religions, I want to talk about my own, and I'm calling out my own people, start living
[2:53:56.880 --> 2:54:04.600]  by the law and stop getting on your knees and sucking up to the corrupt government and
[2:54:04.600 --> 2:54:09.800]  selling out the congregants and the people that have put their trust in you to help them
[2:54:09.800 --> 2:54:10.800]  connect to God.
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:13.800]  Anyway, that's my commentary on the religion.
[2:54:13.800 --> 2:54:17.560]  And I was like, oh, I love you too, because I know you have God consciousness, my spirit
[2:54:17.560 --> 2:54:20.680]  feels really great when I talk to you, I love you too.
[2:54:20.680 --> 2:54:26.160]  Exactly, they have groups that have been divided and manipulated, and if you look at the anti-Jewish
[2:54:26.160 --> 2:54:28.880]  groups, they're being manipulated, if you look at the Jewish supremacist groups, they've
[2:54:28.880 --> 2:54:33.560]  been manipulated, the black supremacist groups, all of it's stupid, there's an evil manipulating
[2:54:33.560 --> 2:54:38.320]  us against each other, and we have to transcend it or it's going to win, it's very simple
[2:54:38.320 --> 2:54:41.040]  and God's watching.
[2:54:41.040 --> 2:54:48.320]  Because only when we're divided and have strife amongst us that the enemy could then
[2:54:48.320 --> 2:54:50.760]  pick us off in segment.
[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:56.320]  But if we are truly united by an overwhelming principle to transcend religion, which is
[2:54:56.320 --> 2:55:01.040]  actually a relationship with God, with the divine, we're made in His image, our lives
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:02.040]  of sanctity.
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:05.200]  That's enough for me to call you a brother or sister, that's it.
[2:55:05.200 --> 2:55:09.920]  And if we unite, and I want to tell you something, no one owns God.
[2:55:09.920 --> 2:55:16.320]  When the Messiah reveals Himself, and I don't care if it's the first, second, or third coming,
[2:55:16.320 --> 2:55:20.760]  whenever the Messiah reveals Himself and the truth of the divine is revealed, I can promise
[2:55:20.760 --> 2:55:27.000]  you, my perception of the divine will be wrong, and so will everyone else's, because the essence
[2:55:27.000 --> 2:55:33.360]  of God is truly hidden, and hopefully we will see the truth and understand the truth of
[2:55:33.360 --> 2:55:38.040]  what He is, but right now we're living in the dark and we're trying to approximate,
[2:55:38.040 --> 2:55:39.920]  guesstimate what He really is.
[2:55:39.920 --> 2:55:44.160]  No, I totally agree, and the New World Order and Klaus Schwab are afraid of the coming
[2:55:44.160 --> 2:55:45.660]  of the Messiah.
[2:55:45.660 --> 2:55:49.240]  Everything they're doing is to stop the next level.
[2:55:49.240 --> 2:55:52.360]  Because it's the death of them, you know, darkness goes away, you just turn on a little
[2:55:52.360 --> 2:55:53.680]  light and it goes away.
[2:55:53.680 --> 2:55:57.840]  And so they know that, they've dug in because they're cornered animals, and that's when
[2:55:57.840 --> 2:55:58.840]  they become dangerous.
[2:55:58.840 --> 2:56:00.800]  So you're asking about what else they can do next.
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:06.240]  Listen, I have some intelligence assets as you do, and some of the options are pretty
[2:56:06.240 --> 2:56:14.000]  unpleasant, whether it's another bioterrorism attack, like the smallpox or mob or virus,
[2:56:14.000 --> 2:56:20.600]  or other weapons of mass destruction that can cause further destabilization.
[2:56:20.600 --> 2:56:27.280]  And these people have no problem wasting away billions of people.
[2:56:27.280 --> 2:56:30.720]  But the reality is, I don't worry about that.
[2:56:30.720 --> 2:56:36.920]  And I have no promises or guarantees to myself or to anyone else that you rise up and storm
[2:56:36.920 --> 2:56:40.640]  the beaches of Normandy of this generation, that you'll survive, especially in the first
[2:56:40.640 --> 2:56:41.640]  wave.
[2:56:41.640 --> 2:56:45.080]  There's a very good chance that you may fall, but so what?
[2:56:45.080 --> 2:56:49.080]  You know, this is a finite life, but you have an opportunity now to connect with the
[2:56:49.080 --> 2:56:52.120]  infinite then, the eternal, and you have to fall in battle.
[2:56:52.120 --> 2:56:54.560]  This is a hill worth dying on.
[2:56:54.560 --> 2:56:56.440]  And so it takes courage.
[2:56:56.440 --> 2:57:00.760]  We grow up with some degree of freedom, not because of us, but because our parents and
[2:57:00.760 --> 2:57:02.240]  grandparents support for it.
[2:57:02.240 --> 2:57:04.360]  The question is, will our kids be free?
[2:57:04.360 --> 2:57:06.360]  Well, the answer is, are we ready to fight for it?
[2:57:06.360 --> 2:57:07.360]  Are we ready to sacrifice?
[2:57:07.360 --> 2:57:08.360]  No, that's right.
[2:57:08.360 --> 2:57:10.720]  We're living off gas they put in the tank.
[2:57:10.720 --> 2:57:13.520]  So how about next generation, our kids?
[2:57:13.520 --> 2:57:18.920]  I hope they grow up with the ability to thrive in a society of God consciousness, but it
[2:57:18.920 --> 2:57:22.920]  depends on, are we ready to create the environment for that to happen?
[2:57:22.920 --> 2:57:23.920]  Stay there.
[2:57:23.920 --> 2:57:26.600]  This segment, Dr. Zelinko, you're absolutely right.
[2:57:26.600 --> 2:57:29.760]  The catalyst this year to go to the next level, we have to decide whether we're going to do
[2:57:29.760 --> 2:57:30.760]  it or not.
[2:57:30.760 --> 2:57:31.760]  Dr. Zelinko is our guest.

[2:57:36.280 --> 2:57:37.280]  And I'm not kidding.
[2:57:37.280 --> 2:57:38.280]  I woke up this morning.
[2:57:38.280 --> 2:57:39.280]  I had a dream about it.
[2:57:39.280 --> 2:57:40.280]  I couldn't remember what it was.
[2:57:40.280 --> 2:57:41.280]  I'm like, get Zelinko on.

[2:59:59.280 --> 3:00:02.440]  One fourth of humanity must be eliminated from the social body.
[3:00:02.440 --> 3:00:05.440]  We are in charge of God's selection process for earth.
[3:00:05.440 --> 3:00:06.440]  He selects we destroy.
[3:00:06.440 --> 3:00:09.160]  We are the riders of the pale horse death.
[3:00:09.160 --> 3:00:13.920]  I remember 25 years ago I read that quote and I went to the library and checked it out
[3:00:13.920 --> 3:00:14.920]  and it was real.
[3:00:14.920 --> 3:00:18.480]  And that's one of the top union advisors.
[3:00:18.480 --> 3:00:20.240]  By the way, we should plug this.
[3:00:20.240 --> 3:00:21.240]  I haven't plugged any.
[3:00:21.240 --> 3:00:23.160]  Dr. Zinko is doing such important work.

[3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:14.840]  Thank you so much.
[3:01:14.840 --> 3:01:19.160]  We have a great holiday coming up in a wonderful new year and we hope to be able to talk to
[3:01:19.160 --> 3:01:20.760]  you obviously next year.
[3:01:20.760 --> 3:01:23.720]  But in the last three and a half minutes we have, what else would you like to impart
[3:01:23.720 --> 3:01:25.360]  to the viewers and listeners?
[3:01:25.360 --> 3:01:31.040]  But first of all, I want to wish everyone a happy holidays, merry Christmas, happy New
[3:01:31.040 --> 3:01:38.000]  Year and my blessing to all people, to all decent people at least, that you should have
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:44.840]  long life and good health and material and spiritual prosperity and true inner peace
[3:01:44.840 --> 3:01:51.640]  and tranquility and appreciate just being, you know, that's one thing living with a serious
[3:01:51.640 --> 3:01:56.480]  illness, you learn to appreciate the moment and not take it for granted.
[3:01:56.480 --> 3:02:01.920]  And interesting in this, and we spoke about this Alex that in the midst of all this chaos,
[3:02:01.920 --> 3:02:06.440]  I found the most serenity in my life than I've ever had.
[3:02:06.440 --> 3:02:11.680]  And I think it's a certain, there's a tonic saying that there's no joy like the resolution
[3:02:11.680 --> 3:02:12.680]  of doubt.
[3:02:12.680 --> 3:02:17.600]  And since I have no doubt what reality is, and I live within the reality, that's ugly,
[3:02:17.600 --> 3:02:25.720]  I know that I see it, but nevertheless, I see the truth and feel, I know how my life
[3:02:25.720 --> 3:02:31.920]  fits into that process as an inner sense of clarity and purpose.
[3:02:31.920 --> 3:02:37.320]  And when I'm aligned with that, I feel the most internal, let's say, emotional and intellectual
[3:02:37.320 --> 3:02:39.000]  and spiritual tranquility.
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:44.000]  And that's a very interesting, and physically feel better now than I've ever felt.
[3:02:44.000 --> 3:02:48.800]  And so, I don't know what God's plan is for me, it's like this divine wave.
[3:02:48.800 --> 3:02:57.120]  But clearly it is to publicize the following idea that he's one, he's good, he makes us
[3:02:57.120 --> 3:03:03.440]  every instant time, he loves us, and he gives us consciousness, and he gives us free choice.
[3:03:03.440 --> 3:03:05.720]  And really only he has free choice, right?
[3:03:05.720 --> 3:03:08.920]  No one makes him do anything, and yet he gives us that power.
[3:03:08.920 --> 3:03:15.880]  And that power is so amazing, but it's real, and we have to choose well, we have to turn
[3:03:15.880 --> 3:03:17.520]  away from bad and do good.
[3:03:17.520 --> 3:03:24.240]  And so, it's really up to us, there's a parable to describe the essence of evil.
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:29.840]  And it's a, you have a king, and he has a son, the prince is going to be king one day.
[3:03:29.840 --> 3:03:35.600]  And he loves his people, and he loves his son, so he wants to make sure that the son is worthy
[3:03:35.600 --> 3:03:41.840]  of being king one day, but he goes to a prostitute, the harlot hires her, and sends her to seduce
[3:03:41.840 --> 3:03:43.360]  his son, the prince.
[3:03:43.360 --> 3:03:44.360]  That's the story.
[3:03:44.360 --> 3:03:46.720]  So let's analyze it, does the king want the son to sin?
[3:03:46.720 --> 3:03:51.720]  No, I mean, he's actually just testing the son to make sure that he has the fiber, the
[3:03:51.720 --> 3:03:53.960]  moral fiber to be a good king.
[3:03:53.960 --> 3:03:57.480]  The prostitute, does she want the son to sin?
[3:03:57.480 --> 3:04:00.880]  Actually think about it, she's doing the will of the king, isn't she?
[3:04:00.880 --> 3:04:05.760]  And so in this particular, that's how I conceptualize God making free choice.
[3:04:05.760 --> 3:04:06.760]  He gives options.
[3:04:06.760 --> 3:04:10.000]  If I give you a hundred dollar bill and a dollar bill, I ask you to choose, that's not much
[3:04:10.000 --> 3:04:11.200]  of a choice, right?
[3:04:11.200 --> 3:04:15.280]  So you need comparable options for the choice to be real.
[3:04:15.280 --> 3:04:20.520]  So God makes good and evil, and they seem equally attractive, and waits for our choices.
[3:04:20.520 --> 3:04:25.280]  Now, if we choose evil, it's like me giving you a beautiful piece of crystal, you drop
[3:04:25.280 --> 3:04:28.680]  it on the floor and then cut your foot and you're bleeding, was it my fault that you're
[3:04:28.680 --> 3:04:31.560]  bleeding, or perhaps you should have been a little bit more careful.
[3:04:31.560 --> 3:04:35.520]  Now, beautifully said, Dr. Zalinko, hopefully we get to talk to you in the new year.
[3:04:35.520 --> 3:04:36.520]  Thank you so much.
[3:04:36.520 --> 3:04:40.760]  People can find more information right now at ZStackLive.com forward slash Alex God bless
[3:04:40.760 --> 3:04:57.840]  you sir, and we really appreciate you.
[3:04:57.840 --> 3:04:58.840]  Look at that.
[3:04:58.840 --> 3:05:02.480]  Everybody else is just like yellow or clear, and that's because it's been denatured, it's
[3:05:02.480 --> 3:05:03.480]  been walked out.
[3:05:03.480 --> 3:05:05.200]  We didn't do that.
[3:05:05.200 --> 3:05:10.440]  You think I would metaphysically tell you something, this is the very best I can get.
[3:05:10.440 --> 3:05:12.600]  I'd rather go to hell than do that.
[3:05:12.600 --> 3:05:18.600]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because
[3:05:18.600 --> 3:05:20.960]  I want that good will.
[3:05:20.960 --> 3:05:25.080]  What I do to you, I do to myself, don't you get the big secret?
[3:05:25.080 --> 3:05:28.080]  You ever seen fish oil look like that?
[3:05:28.080 --> 3:05:29.800]  No, you never seen that, have you?
[3:05:29.800 --> 3:05:40.280]  And this little jewel right here is solid, liquid consciousness.
[3:05:40.280 --> 3:05:41.920]  Look it up.
[3:05:41.920 --> 3:05:47.720]  Find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[3:05:47.720 --> 3:05:53.280]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil, just like
[3:05:53.280 --> 3:06:05.480]  your information is dynamite, so are our products in 4store.com.
[3:06:05.480 --> 3:06:13.800]  And if I have to leave the world, I accept God's will, but I encourage and plead with
[3:06:13.800 --> 3:06:25.200]  everyone else to up your game and stand up and resist.
[3:06:25.200 --> 3:06:30.400]  Yeah hi, this is Dr. Zelenko and I'm making this a video from my hospital bed.
[3:06:30.400 --> 3:06:33.360]  I just want to give a quick update.
[3:06:33.360 --> 3:06:41.600]  Many many people have expressed their love and prayers and I'm very grateful, thank you.
[3:06:41.600 --> 3:06:51.840]  Unfortunately I had an MRI and a trans esophageal echocardiogram called a TE, and it found a
[3:06:51.840 --> 3:07:01.440]  tumor in my right ventricle, that's the lower right chamber of the heart.
[3:07:01.440 --> 3:07:08.960]  And on top of that tumor is a blood clot, that's not pretty good news, it's not good
[3:07:08.960 --> 3:07:17.640]  news, and the treatment would be to go on blood thinners, which I'm on, to try to dissolve
[3:07:17.640 --> 3:07:23.800]  the clot, and then we have to figure out what to do with that tumor.
[3:07:23.800 --> 3:07:32.000]  To be frank, if that clot breaks off, that's a ticket to the next world.
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:39.000]  So there are more tumors around my lower left lobe and my lung.
[3:07:39.000 --> 3:07:48.120]  So I'm in a precarious situation, however, as King David writes, even though I walk in
[3:07:48.120 --> 3:07:53.960]  the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil, for God is with me, and I do really feel that
[3:07:53.960 --> 3:08:00.160]  way and those words resonate in my soul more now than ever in my life.
[3:08:00.160 --> 3:08:06.040]  And there is a tell, mutic teaching, that even if the sword is on your neck, a person
[3:08:06.040 --> 3:08:08.280]  should never give up hope.
[3:08:08.280 --> 3:08:15.600]  And so I'm in a very good state of mind, and as I frequently said, they're going to have
[3:08:15.600 --> 3:08:29.080]  to carry my body off the battlefield, because my resolve to help humanity, the vulnerable,
[3:08:29.080 --> 3:08:36.880]  the innocent, the decent people, overcome this terrible darkness and plague that is
[3:08:36.880 --> 3:08:39.760]  upon us, has never been stronger.
[3:08:39.760 --> 3:08:48.040]  And if I have to leave the world, I accept God's will, but I encourage and plead with
[3:08:48.040 --> 3:08:57.560]  everyone else to up your game and stand up and resist first within yourselves against
[3:08:57.560 --> 3:09:03.680]  giving into fear, and then resist publicly against the policies of tyranny which are
[3:09:03.680 --> 3:09:10.480]  coming again, because it's pretty obvious what's going to happen right now.
[3:09:10.480 --> 3:09:18.440]  The World Health Organization, which is essentially funded by the sociopath Gates, is gaining
[3:09:18.440 --> 3:09:23.000]  more and more power over sovereign nations.
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:30.120]  Gates messaged, I think five or six months ago, that smallpox is a big threat, and then
[3:09:30.120 --> 3:09:37.640]  supposedly was eradicated in 1980, and it was only found in two labs in America and in
[3:09:37.640 --> 3:09:43.680]  Russia, in DSL level four labs, the highest maximum security labs.
[3:09:43.680 --> 3:09:52.080]  And yet five days after the sociopath criminal Gates said his prophetic words, a few vials
[3:09:52.080 --> 3:10:01.960]  of smallpox were found in an unsecured refrigerator in a Merck laboratory in Philadelphia.
[3:10:01.960 --> 3:10:10.000]  And so, it's not surprising to me now that we're seeing monkeypox, I anticipate global
[3:10:10.000 --> 3:10:17.640]  panic about it, this will be the next media horror narrative that will continue the fear
[3:10:17.640 --> 3:10:27.720]  campaign, and lockdown campaign, and mass campaign to create anxiety, isolate you from
[3:10:27.720 --> 3:10:35.680]  people you love, and dehumanize you with these taste diapers.
[3:10:35.680 --> 3:10:48.080]  And so, this is their playbook, and they're going to keep on sending wave after wave of
[3:10:48.080 --> 3:10:58.920]  their evil agenda until we make internal resolutions to kick the evil out from within us.
[3:10:58.920 --> 3:11:07.920]  We should, in my opinion, denounce the worship of false gods, the god of technology, the
[3:11:07.920 --> 3:11:18.560]  god of science, the god of corrupt governments, money, power, fame, and reconcile our hearts
[3:11:18.560 --> 3:11:23.560]  with our Creator, who's making us anew every instant in time.
[3:11:23.560 --> 3:11:31.840]  Basically, the world has now chosen sides, those that will worship the machinations of
[3:11:31.840 --> 3:11:37.680]  men, and those that will bow down to the Creator.
[3:11:37.680 --> 3:11:46.520]  And so, let the calling begin.
[3:11:46.520 --> 3:11:56.760]  The world needs a cleaning, and when the process is done, the world will be filled with knowledge
[3:11:56.760 --> 3:12:03.560]  of God, just like the waters cover the seas, and the sociopaths have a big thing coming
[3:12:03.560 --> 3:12:04.800]  for them.
[3:12:04.800 --> 3:12:11.360]  They think they're gods, they think they're ruling the world, and we'll see.
[3:12:11.360 --> 3:12:19.640]  So, let the games begin, and I have no problem falling in battle, because this is a hill
[3:12:19.640 --> 3:12:27.040]  that we need to die for, because otherwise our progeny will have nowhere to breathe
[3:12:27.040 --> 3:12:28.040]  free.
[3:12:28.040 --> 3:12:36.120]  I just came from my doctors, and not good news.
[3:12:36.120 --> 3:12:45.280]  My cancer, which I've been fighting for for four years, has progressed.
[3:12:45.280 --> 3:12:52.640]  There's one last ditch effort that may lead to cure, which I'm going to do, but if that
[3:12:52.640 --> 3:12:57.280]  fails, then the estimates are unpleasant.
[3:12:57.280 --> 3:13:02.400]  But I've been at this place multiple times in the last four years.
[3:13:02.400 --> 3:13:09.560]  And so, when someone lives with that consciousness, something happens, and something very good
[3:13:09.560 --> 3:13:10.560]  happens.
[3:13:10.560 --> 3:13:20.880]  You kind of live each day, and you appreciate time, and in reality, just think of it philosophically,
[3:13:20.880 --> 3:13:24.760]  you begin to die from the day you're born.
[3:13:24.760 --> 3:13:27.360]  No one lives forever.
[3:13:27.360 --> 3:13:30.320]  Some people live 20 years, some people live 100 years.
[3:13:30.320 --> 3:13:34.360]  But in the grand scheme of creation, it's fine.
[3:13:34.360 --> 3:13:40.200]  So, in my opinion, it's not important when and how you die.
[3:13:40.200 --> 3:13:44.400]  It's much more important how you live.
[3:13:44.400 --> 3:13:53.520]  And so, because when and how you die is not in your control, but how you live is in your
[3:13:53.520 --> 3:13:54.520]  control.
[3:13:54.520 --> 3:14:01.320]  How you think, how you speak, and how you act is within the free world of delusion of
[3:14:01.320 --> 3:14:02.320]  man.
[3:14:02.320 --> 3:14:10.400]  So, my advice to people is appreciate the gift of consciousness in life that you're being
[3:14:10.400 --> 3:14:11.400]  given.
[3:14:11.400 --> 3:14:19.200]  Happy birthday, because every instant of time is a reactive recreation, so dynamic involvement
[3:14:19.200 --> 3:14:21.920]  in God's part for us to be.
[3:14:21.920 --> 3:14:29.640]  If you woke up, that's proof that He wants you to be, that you didn't finish your job.
[3:14:29.640 --> 3:14:40.960]  And I would say the world will be redeemed or fixed, rectified through acts of goodness
[3:14:40.960 --> 3:14:42.960]  and kindness.
[3:14:42.960 --> 3:14:47.640]  Even if the sword is on your neck, you should never give up hope.
[3:14:47.640 --> 3:14:55.640]  I do feel the sword on my neck, but I'm still very hopeful, and I live with more tranquility
[3:14:55.640 --> 3:15:01.640]  and serenity than I've ever had in my life, which is very counterintuitive, because for
[3:15:01.640 --> 3:15:07.560]  the carnage and the malevolence evil that I come into contact with in the last two years,
[3:15:07.560 --> 3:15:11.560]  I would not expect that type of inner peace.
[3:15:11.560 --> 3:15:17.800]  But what I've realized is that when you're in alignment, you seem to be in alignment
[3:15:17.800 --> 3:15:22.760]  with the divine will, there's a certain gift of tranquility that's given.
[3:15:22.760 --> 3:15:30.440]  And it's not easy, by the way, it's very hard, but so what, and it's kind of some struggle,
[3:15:30.440 --> 3:15:33.560]  but all the suffering that I went through, I still wouldn't give it up.
[3:15:33.560 --> 3:15:38.880]  By the way, I didn't ask for this challenge, but no one asked me, so as I went through it,
[3:15:38.880 --> 3:15:43.680]  and I am going through it, the serenity is really something that I've been seeking my
[3:15:43.680 --> 3:15:56.440]  whole life, so I'm very grateful to have it.
[3:15:56.440 --> 3:16:03.560]  Granny Do Right, Granny Do Right, thanks for holding her on the ear, go ahead.
[3:16:03.560 --> 3:16:06.520]  Challenge, first of all, let me say I love your products.
[3:16:06.520 --> 3:16:12.000]  I am a granny, and for all the senior citizens out there that may have spent a lifetime in
[3:16:12.000 --> 3:16:17.520]  the sun like me, I was loaded up with sunspots, or age spots, as they're lovingly called.
[3:16:17.520 --> 3:16:22.680]  But since taking your X2 for the last couple of years, my skin is just really gorgeous,
[3:16:22.680 --> 3:16:23.680]  actually.
[3:16:23.680 --> 3:16:26.800]  People think I'm 55 years old.
[3:16:26.800 --> 3:16:30.880]  And I was already taking your other supplements, but I thought, you know, well, maybe that's
[3:16:30.880 --> 3:16:35.160]  what I need to do, because I just thought it was a hopeless situation, but when I started
[3:16:35.160 --> 3:16:40.200]  taking it, I mean, it doesn't happen immediately, but, you know, over a period of time, I started
[3:16:40.200 --> 3:16:45.240]  noticing, okay, you know, this is a ticket, this is working, this is wonderful, you know,
[3:16:45.240 --> 3:16:51.520]  I don't have to put on derma blend anymore, you know, so anyway, it worked wonderfully
[3:16:51.520 --> 3:16:54.840]  and it really has totally cleared up my skin.
[3:16:54.840 --> 3:17:00.440]  That's just Susan's new film, 2000 Mules, is the most important documentary in modern
[3:17:00.440 --> 3:17:05.240]  times because it proves how the deep state stole the 2020 election and how they're planning
[3:17:05.240 --> 3:17:09.320]  to steal future elections and complete our journey to basically being like Venezuela.
[3:17:09.320 --> 3:17:13.280]  Now, it's great that it's online and it's great that millions watch online, but you
[3:17:13.280 --> 3:17:19.200]  need to have the high quality HD DVD in your library with the expanded extras so it can't
[3:17:19.200 --> 3:17:23.320]  be censored in the future and so you can show it to everyone you know.
[3:17:23.320 --> 3:17:29.720]  Go to infowarstore.com and get 2000 mules today and get it discounted up to 30% off when you
[3:17:29.720 --> 3:17:35.080]  get it with other documentary films like in-game blueprint for global enslavement, the seminal
[3:17:35.080 --> 3:17:39.040]  classic that predicted the great reset, and of course, part one, part two, and now the
[3:17:39.040 --> 3:17:41.800]  new part three of COVID land.
[3:17:41.800 --> 3:17:47.200]  Get them separate, get them together, massively discounted at infowarstore.com, but everyone
[3:17:47.200 --> 3:17:52.200]  needs to have 2000 mules in their library so the globalists can't censor it.
[3:17:52.200 --> 3:18:01.200]  Go to infowarstore.com to get 2000 mules today.
[3:18:01.200 --> 3:18:02.640]  I want to say Brain Force is great.
[3:18:02.640 --> 3:18:04.640]  I want to say Turbo Force is amazing.
[3:18:04.640 --> 3:18:05.640]  It is.
[3:18:05.640 --> 3:18:10.120]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[3:18:10.120 --> 3:18:11.480]  The fish oil is better than it.
[3:18:11.480 --> 3:18:13.360]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[3:18:13.360 --> 3:18:19.000]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[3:18:19.000 --> 3:18:23.000]  Fish oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm sorry, you want something
[3:18:23.000 --> 3:18:24.520]  like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[3:18:24.520 --> 3:18:27.600]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view.
[3:18:27.600 --> 3:18:31.240]  I'm not a medical statement here, but let me tell you something, I eat five caplets
[3:18:31.240 --> 3:18:36.120]  of krill oil before I go to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[3:18:36.120 --> 3:18:43.600]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[3:18:43.600 --> 3:18:47.040]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever
[3:18:47.040 --> 3:18:50.760]  is the best as we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it.
[3:18:50.760 --> 3:19:20.320]  InfoWarsStore.com
[3:19:20.320 --> 3:19:27.640]  is my saturday.
[3:19:27.640 --> 3:19:34.440]  and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can
[3:19:34.440 --> 3:19:40.920]  stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[3:19:40.920 --> 3:19:46.680]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[3:19:46.680 --> 3:19:53.200]  facts that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself
[3:19:53.200 --> 3:20:03.000]  at InfowarsStore.com. Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:03.000 --> 3:20:19.800]  Well, there have been a lot of champions, a lot of great men and women in the last 25,
[3:20:19.800 --> 3:20:24.960]  26 months that have really exposed the evil that was this giant depopulation operation that
[3:20:24.960 --> 3:20:28.760]  we're still in the middle of, but that because so many people got woken what was happening,
[3:20:28.760 --> 3:20:34.040]  they kind of partially pulled back their attack, their offensive. But out of all of them, Dr.
[3:20:34.040 --> 3:20:42.920]  Zelenko has been the most informative and the most accurate. Dr. Vladimir Zelenko is here with us.
[3:20:42.920 --> 3:20:47.440]  He's a medical doctor, of course, that pioneered treatments that saved tens of thousands of lives
[3:20:47.440 --> 3:20:54.560]  in New York as patients that then helped trigger really a therapeutic revolution of research
[3:20:54.560 --> 3:21:00.320]  that the entire power structure tried to block. And I wanted him to come on today and just talk
[3:21:00.320 --> 3:21:04.600]  about how he was right so he can then tell us about what he thinks is coming in the future.
[3:21:04.600 --> 3:21:08.040]  And he said, yeah, let's not get into me being right. Everybody knows what was witnessed here.
[3:21:08.040 --> 3:21:13.840]  Let's move on to the big picture of transhumanism and some of the world economic foreign people
[3:21:13.840 --> 3:21:18.040]  that are promoting statements like, why do we need so many people? We're about to become gods.
[3:21:18.040 --> 3:21:23.880]  Let's get rid of everyone. I mean, really evil, sinister stuff that you'd imagine you'd see in
[3:21:23.880 --> 3:21:28.520]  like a Marvel Comics supervillain, but it's actually coming out of the globalist operation.
[3:21:28.520 --> 3:21:32.000]  So I'm glad he wants to get to that because I want to take on it. That was actually on my list
[3:21:32.000 --> 3:21:37.200]  of topics. So, sir, great to have you with us, Dr. Zelenko, please try to cut to the heart of it.
[3:21:37.200 --> 3:21:38.840]  As you said, you wanted to during the break when we talked.
[3:21:38.840 --> 3:21:49.200]  Thanks, Alex. Thanks for having me. So the enemy is godless, doesn't believe in an afterlife,
[3:21:49.200 --> 3:21:56.720]  but they don't want to die. And if you ask them what happens to consciousness after you die,
[3:21:56.720 --> 3:22:05.840]  they say just ceases to be. And so what they're trying to do for the last 30 years is to create
[3:22:05.840 --> 3:22:11.960]  a way to escape death. I know it sounds weird, but that's exactly what they're trying to do.
[3:22:11.960 --> 3:22:17.680]  I don't think they'll succeed. But we need to understand the motivations of the enemy so
[3:22:17.680 --> 3:22:23.920]  that we can have a rational and good strategic response. And so if you listen to people like
[3:22:23.920 --> 3:22:30.040]  Ray Kurzweil and someone else whose name is Yuval Noah Harari, which we'll talk about more in a
[3:22:30.040 --> 3:22:38.560]  minute, what they're trying to do is create a inorganic, organic platform, humanoid platform,
[3:22:38.560 --> 3:22:43.840]  that has artificial intelligence where human consciousness could literally be downloaded
[3:22:43.840 --> 3:22:53.320]  into. And so the self-proclaimed elites will then have a platform for eternal life. And because
[3:22:53.320 --> 3:22:58.200]  they have a problem that the physical body that we live in only has a limited lifespan,
[3:22:58.200 --> 3:23:03.880]  but 50 years, 100 years, whatever it is, it's finite. And so when this body begins to fail,
[3:23:03.880 --> 3:23:09.720]  they want to be able to try and download or transfer their consciousness into a humanoid
[3:23:09.720 --> 3:23:15.720]  platform, and then eventually over time into other humanoid platforms, you know, upgrade
[3:23:15.720 --> 3:23:23.560]  so to speak. Now, this is exactly what their agenda is, because they know that what they believe,
[3:23:23.560 --> 3:23:31.000]  especially is that if they were to die, that they would cease to be. Now, in that world view,
[3:23:32.440 --> 3:23:39.240]  they are prepared to waste 6.5 billion people, because it's completely unnecessary, useless
[3:23:39.240 --> 3:23:45.800]  eaters, and they don't need that many slaves. And so what this vaccine platform has been,
[3:23:47.400 --> 3:23:51.320]  these vaccines do a lot of things except one thing, prevent COVID-19.
[3:23:51.320 --> 3:23:58.520]  There are three simultaneous agent capabilities of these vaccines. One is population control,
[3:23:59.800 --> 3:24:07.480]  and that's done through four different phenomenon. One is a percentage of people die relatively
[3:24:09.080 --> 3:24:15.800]  soon after getting injected. Long-term lifespans are being reduced because of chronic diseases,
[3:24:15.800 --> 3:24:21.480]  such as cancer and autoimmune diseases. There's miscarriage rates that are skyrocketing from 10
[3:24:21.480 --> 3:24:28.680]  to 82%, and actually recent DOD data, Department of Defense data say over 300%, and then there's
[3:24:28.680 --> 3:24:37.800]  infertility. All this was predicted by the FDA in October 2020. This was not an accidental finding.
[3:24:37.800 --> 3:24:46.840]  This was a premeditated plan proven by the fact that the FDA reported that this was going to happen
[3:24:46.840 --> 3:24:53.320]  to its scientists two months prior to the rollout, and now we have 15 months of data that corroborates.
[3:24:53.960 --> 3:25:03.720]  Number two, there is an enslavement component here, a control mechanism, a 24-7 surveillance
[3:25:03.720 --> 3:25:10.680]  component about bringing the ability to measure biometric data under the skin and then transmit
[3:25:10.680 --> 3:25:16.600]  that data to a third party with your location, and then the linkage of that to cryptocurrency,
[3:25:16.600 --> 3:25:25.160]  which in 2026, according to congressional data, when Medicare begins to fail and the world economies
[3:25:25.160 --> 3:25:32.040]  become unstable, there will be a, you might let a good crisis go to waste, there'll be a transition
[3:25:32.040 --> 3:25:40.600]  from the current economic system to a one-world cryptocurrency-based financial system, which
[3:25:40.600 --> 3:25:48.600]  will then create the mechanism for control of human behavior, because if the powers would be
[3:25:48.600 --> 3:25:52.440]  that could control the system, don't like you, they just turn off your ability to buy bread
[3:25:52.440 --> 3:26:00.200]  for your family. And then the third most sinister component to this is the transhumanist component,
[3:26:00.200 --> 3:26:08.680]  or the ability to hack into your genetic code using an mRNA platform to deliver CRISPR-Cas9
[3:26:08.680 --> 3:26:15.880]  technology, and gene-edit U, so that you no longer made an image of God, but you made an image of
[3:26:15.880 --> 3:26:20.680]  Klaus Schwab or Bill Gates. They're literally going to re-engineer what it means to be human,
[3:26:20.680 --> 3:26:32.840]  and so this Yubal Noah Harari is a wayward Jew from Israel, professor of history at Hebrew
[3:26:32.840 --> 3:26:39.080]  University, and he's called a prophet by people like Klaus Schwab, Bill Gates.
[3:26:39.080 --> 3:26:44.360]  That's right, they call him basically their high priest, and he says stuff that quite frankly
[3:26:44.360 --> 3:26:47.880]  sounds like he came out of the mouth of Hitler, like we don't need most people, we're about to
[3:26:47.880 --> 3:26:53.320]  become gods, and this is dangerous. And Obama, Obama called him his favorite author in CNN,
[3:26:53.960 --> 3:26:59.880]  and so what does this guy say? Well, he says that humans are hackable animals,
[3:27:00.840 --> 3:27:06.040]  that, and since we can hack into your genetic code, we could re-engineer it with intelligent
[3:27:06.040 --> 3:27:13.640]  design, but not with some God above the Klaus intelligent design, but rather by human intelligent
[3:27:13.640 --> 3:27:20.920]  design, because we are now like gods. There's no such thing as a soul, there's no such thing as
[3:27:20.920 --> 3:27:27.160]  free will. These are just some of the tidbits of what this guy says. This is literally Genesis out
[3:27:27.160 --> 3:27:32.600]  of one of the oldest Jewish books telling us the serpent said it, and now he's saying it right now.
[3:27:34.440 --> 3:27:38.360]  Well, he is a serpent, he's the embodiment of the serpent, and it's very
[3:27:38.360 --> 3:27:46.120]  actually relating to me that the enemy's finally exposed himself, because he's just one little
[3:27:46.120 --> 3:27:53.240]  man, but he represents an ideology that we have allowed to exist through the godless
[3:27:53.240 --> 3:28:00.840]  vacuum that we have created in the world, in the society. He's the inevitable outcome of a society
[3:28:00.840 --> 3:28:07.400]  that has allowed for the desecration of the sanctity of life, the sanctity of marriage,
[3:28:07.400 --> 3:28:11.080]  and the sanctity of gender. You're saying we conjured him by our sin?
[3:28:14.040 --> 3:28:21.720]  We allow for darkness to exist if we do not bring light into the world. Powerful,
[3:28:21.720 --> 3:28:26.440]  stay there, I want to get into this, because I watch his whole speeches, and they're so satanic,
[3:28:26.440 --> 3:28:31.320]  it makes your head spin, and there's Klaus Schwab drooling while he speaks, and so they definitely
[3:28:31.960 --> 3:28:36.040]  worshiped this guy, and we're going to talk about what he believes on the other side with
[3:28:36.040 --> 3:28:40.920]  Dr. Zelenko. This is so important, you can find Dr. Zelenko's site on screen, we'll come back,
[3:28:40.920 --> 3:28:45.960]  we'll tell you about that as well. This is an incredible time, everything is coming to a head,
[3:28:45.960 --> 3:28:50.280]  ladies and gentlemen. This is the battle of the gods, whatever you want to call it, it's happening.
[3:28:55.800 --> 3:29:03.720]  There is nothing, there is no more epitome of free speech than right here, and that's what people
[3:29:03.720 --> 3:29:08.840]  recognize and resonate with, and as Ward said, you're not going to find a better place for
[3:29:08.840 --> 3:29:12.840]  information. You might not agree with everything, you might not agree with all our perspectives,
[3:29:12.840 --> 3:29:17.560]  but we cover all the information, and there's nowhere else really that does it like we do here.
[3:29:17.560 --> 3:29:21.960]  Thank you for that, Ward. Infowarsstore.com, by the way, the products he mentions,
[3:29:21.960 --> 3:29:26.120]  infowarsstore.com is where to get them, folks, and we do have the best supplements. I mean,
[3:29:26.120 --> 3:29:32.920]  just like we try our best with our news coverage and our information, we do the best with our
[3:29:32.920 --> 3:29:38.360]  supplements as well. I mean, look at the hair and beard support formula, folks, this is a joke.
[3:29:38.360 --> 3:29:42.440]  I mean, we're giving this thing away, it's 75% off. By the way, it works for me,
[3:29:42.440 --> 3:29:49.960]  in case you haven't noticed, the hair and beard formula is working for me. Quite well, I might add.
[3:29:49.960 --> 3:29:55.720]  Quite well, my barber appreciates hair and beard support for men, I go and see him quite often now.
[3:29:55.720 --> 3:30:00.440]  Look at that, everybody else is just like yellow or clear, that's because it's been denatured,
[3:30:00.440 --> 3:30:06.120]  it's been worked out, we didn't do that. Do you think I would metaphysically
[3:30:06.120 --> 3:30:10.680]  tell you something that this is the very best I can get? I'd rather go to hell and do that.
[3:30:10.680 --> 3:30:18.200]  I will only give you the maximum best info, the maximum truth, the maximum product, because I want
[3:30:18.200 --> 3:30:23.880]  that good will. What I do to you, I do to myself, don't you get the big secret? You ever seen
[3:30:23.880 --> 3:30:30.760]  fish oil look like that? No, you never seen that, have you? And this little jewel right here is solid,
[3:30:33.480 --> 3:30:34.840]  liquid consciousness.
[3:30:38.200 --> 3:30:45.720]  Look it up, find out how even the FDA and the government admits fish oil is incredible.
[3:30:45.720 --> 3:30:51.000]  The number one thing anybody can do for themselves is take good fish oil or krill oil,
[3:30:51.000 --> 3:30:54.280]  just like our information is dynamite, so are our products in 4store.com.
[3:30:55.720 --> 3:30:59.800]  I don't care if you work in a cafeteria or a pump gas or whether you're a farmer,
[3:30:59.800 --> 3:31:04.840]  a rancher, a doctor, a lawyer or a millionaire, Fortune and Money Magazine have all done these
[3:31:04.840 --> 3:31:09.800]  profiles, you see it every year, 30 different tax returns, 30 different answers, 50 different tax
[3:31:09.800 --> 3:31:15.640]  returns, 50 different answers and almost all of them just screw you over, especially the big firms
[3:31:15.640 --> 3:31:20.280]  and the big tax groups, because they're part of the system and they don't want the general public
[3:31:20.280 --> 3:31:25.320]  understanding this and knowing this, so it's a very important situation with inflation and all
[3:31:25.320 --> 3:31:31.720]  the things out there hurting everybody. To be able to do things tax wise, it's legal and lawful
[3:31:31.720 --> 3:31:35.560]  that allows you to keep more of your money. We wouldn't even be here if I hadn't gotten great tax
[3:31:35.560 --> 3:31:43.560]  advice in the last few years. The only way you fail is not writing down the URL, jonestaxrelief.com,

[3:32:45.640 --> 3:32:53.000]  1776 part two against the New World Order because the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:32:53.000 --> 3:33:06.120]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:33:23.160 --> 3:33:32.520]  You've all know a Harari is the high priest. They call him the leader, the prophet of Klaus Schwab.
[3:33:32.520 --> 3:33:37.400]  They just fall over themselves. I've watched the video of Hollywood and Schwab. They just
[3:33:37.400 --> 3:33:42.680]  rubble to him and he says to her and tells them, why do we need so many people? Why do we need all
[3:33:42.680 --> 3:33:46.920]  this? And this is the transhumanist cult. Everything they're doing is coming out of this
[3:33:47.480 --> 3:33:52.280]  plan. Here's just a few of the clips, but you can't do it justice. Everything he says is just
[3:33:52.280 --> 3:33:58.280]  so freaking evil here it is. And then the big political and economic question of the 21st
[3:33:58.280 --> 3:34:05.160]  century will be what do we need humans for or at least what do we need so many humans for?
[3:34:05.160 --> 3:34:12.280]  Do you have an answer in the book? At present the best guess we have is keep them happy with
[3:34:12.280 --> 3:34:17.880]  drugs and computer games. We call this the metaverse. What you guys do in here? Pretty much
[3:34:17.880 --> 3:34:22.840]  everything that you would do in the real world. Or at least what do we need so many humans for?
[3:34:22.840 --> 3:34:29.160]  What constitute a new useless class? When I say that these are useless humans, it's not from the
[3:34:29.160 --> 3:34:37.000]  viewpoint of the mother, of the wife, of the son. Or at least what do we need so many humans for?
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:42.920]  First we've got population. Now the world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about
[3:34:42.920 --> 3:34:50.280]  9 billion. Now if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health
[3:34:50.280 --> 3:34:55.880]  services, we could lower that by perhaps 10 or 15 percent. Or at least what do we need so many
[3:34:55.880 --> 3:35:01.160]  humans for? To get the conspiracy. Listen to our government agencies. These guys are telling the
[3:35:01.160 --> 3:35:06.600]  truth. You know there's no conspiracy here folks. Just get your damn vaccine. All right thank you
[3:35:06.600 --> 3:35:15.160]  guys. And COVID is critical because this is what convinces people to accept, to legitimize
[3:35:16.200 --> 3:35:24.040]  total biometric surveillance. If we want to stop this epidemic, we need not just to monitor people,
[3:35:24.040 --> 3:35:31.160]  we need to monitor what's happening under their skin. What we have seen so far is corporations
[3:35:31.160 --> 3:35:36.680]  and governments collecting data about where we go, who we meet, what movies we watch.
[3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:45.960]  The next phase is the surveillance going under our skin. We now see mass surveillance systems
[3:35:45.960 --> 3:35:52.120]  established even in democratic countries which previously rejected them. And we also see a
[3:35:52.120 --> 3:36:00.040]  change in the nature of surveillance. Previously surveillance was mainly above the skin. Now it's
[3:36:00.040 --> 3:36:07.480]  going under the skin. Governments want to know not just where we go or who we meet, above all they
[3:36:07.480 --> 3:36:13.400]  want to know what is happening under our skin. What's our body temperature? What's our blood pressure?
[3:36:13.400 --> 3:36:23.560]  What is our medical condition? Now humans are developing even bigger powers than ever before.
[3:36:23.560 --> 3:36:31.160]  We are really acquiring divine powers of creation and destruction. We are really upgrading humans
[3:36:31.160 --> 3:36:38.680]  into gods. We are acquiring for instance the power to re-engineer life. Humans are now hackable
[3:36:38.680 --> 3:36:46.520]  animals. You know the whole idea that humans have you know this they have this soul or spirit and
[3:36:46.520 --> 3:36:52.280]  they have free will and nobody knows what's happening inside me. So whatever I choose whether
[3:36:52.280 --> 3:36:58.680]  in the election or whether in the supermarket this is my free will that's over. I mean all
[3:36:58.680 --> 3:37:03.080]  this story about Jesus rising from the dead and being the Son of God this is fake news.
[3:37:04.280 --> 3:37:10.360]  I know that in recent years we saw populist politicians undermining deliberately the trust
[3:37:10.360 --> 3:37:16.840]  that people have in important institutions like universities like respectable media outlets.
[3:37:16.840 --> 3:37:22.600]  These populist politicians told people that say scientists are these small elites.
[3:37:22.600 --> 3:37:26.280]  So I apologize for suggesting you to that. It's only a small portion of it but I wanted you to see
[3:37:26.840 --> 3:37:32.120]  what Dr. Zelenko was talking about. So what obviously listeners know this is horrific but
[3:37:32.120 --> 3:37:38.120]  what are we hearing here because this is a open my view declaration of war against our very existence
[3:37:38.120 --> 3:37:42.840]  and hey he said your free will forget about it it's gone. Well that doesn't sound like something
[3:37:42.840 --> 3:37:51.560]  a good guy says to me Dr. Zelenko. You really want to know what motivates him? What? So he's
[3:37:51.560 --> 3:37:58.920]  a brilliant man. It's not I think it's important to respect your adversary and their capabilities.
[3:37:58.920 --> 3:38:05.640]  He is a PhD from Oxford. He's influenced the most powerful people in the world but what really
[3:38:05.640 --> 3:38:10.920]  motivates him is something much more simple. He's learned he knows the Bible very well
[3:38:10.920 --> 3:38:19.320]  and if he knows the Bible very well he knows what God says or what is stated in the Bible what is
[3:38:19.320 --> 3:38:25.800]  right and what is wrong. Now I'm going to say this not because I'm placing a value judgment
[3:38:25.800 --> 3:38:30.840]  but because how he interprets it. Now I personally believe people could live any way they want
[3:38:30.840 --> 3:38:37.960]  and it's between them and God. So I'm not God's policeman but he's a homosexual and he's married
[3:38:37.960 --> 3:38:44.440]  to someone a man his name is Yitzhak and he knows what the Bible he mentioned it earlier he has real
[3:38:44.440 --> 3:38:49.480]  problems with it. He knows what the Bible says about homosexuality it's called an abomination and it
[3:38:49.480 --> 3:39:01.240]  really really pisses him off and so from his worldview it's not enough let go live your life
[3:39:01.240 --> 3:39:10.840]  quietly anywhere you want no he decided that he's going to take on God and he's going to invalidate
[3:39:11.800 --> 3:39:18.440]  the concept of God in people's minds because in his worldview God cannot exist because if God exists
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:24.040]  and there's a right and wrong then he has a big problem in his mind there's his cognitive dissonance
[3:39:24.040 --> 3:39:31.000]  and then there's his emotional turbulence and guilt and he gets anxious. So literally the whole world
[3:39:32.040 --> 3:39:39.080]  has to suffer because you will know Harari's sexual orientation is not in line with what he
[3:39:39.080 --> 3:39:47.000]  read in the Bible and therefore he has to try to destroy God consciousness in humanity.
[3:39:48.120 --> 3:39:52.920]  That's really exactly what it is they are in rebellion against the code we've been given
[3:39:52.920 --> 3:39:58.360]  to be successful we have free will to follow it or not and he has decided to not just rebel
[3:39:58.360 --> 3:40:03.000]  but to go 180 degrees the opposite direction which is extremely powerful because it's anti
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:11.400]  Christ it's it's it or it's anti human it's anti God consciousness and so again we're all complex
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:17.880]  beings I know I'm not perfect maybe you are I like no I'm certainly not I have my demons and I have
[3:40:17.880 --> 3:40:23.800]  to deal with also but I don't in private and I try to work out my relationship with God in
[3:40:23.800 --> 3:40:34.520]  private and I'm not judging you will know Harari until he takes the war against God into the world
[3:40:34.520 --> 3:40:43.320]  and his policies will result in the extermination of 6.5 billion people at least and so this cannot
[3:40:43.320 --> 3:40:53.160]  be allowed to go on his ideology and his arrogance to believe that human beings are now gods
[3:40:54.840 --> 3:41:02.840]  is incompatible with decency incompatible with societal living incompatible with God's will
[3:41:03.400 --> 3:41:10.040]  and cannot allow cannot be allowed to go on and does the serpent say no not you are a god
[3:41:10.040 --> 3:41:15.800]  you're going to live forever eat of this I mean it's literally be God take over but but he is
[3:41:15.800 --> 3:41:20.120]  it's not God because God gives us free will he says you don't get free will which proves he's not
[3:41:20.120 --> 3:41:28.040]  God he's saying I'm going to take your free will you know that's how the serpent seduced the woman
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:37.960]  but you know the human being was meant to live forever God said in the Bible in Genesis that
[3:41:37.960 --> 3:41:42.840]  if you are to if you were to eat from this fruit then on that day you should surely die
[3:41:43.960 --> 3:41:49.560]  and so there's a very interesting question that arises there were two trees in the garden of
[3:41:49.560 --> 3:41:54.680]  there's one the tree of knowledge of good and bad which they were not supposed to eat from
[3:41:55.400 --> 3:42:02.520]  and then there was the tree of life and so after the sin there is a conversation between
[3:42:02.520 --> 3:42:10.600]  God and his angels it says let's evict the man and his wife from the garden of Eden
[3:42:10.600 --> 3:42:15.480]  lest he eat from the tree of life and live forever so there's an interesting question
[3:42:15.480 --> 3:42:21.400]  he was supposed to live forever and then there was a sin so why not let him repent

[3:47:01.800 --> 3:47:23.800]  alex jones the answer to 1984 is 1776 and i'll show your host zdtoxlife.com is the website
[3:47:24.680 --> 3:47:29.640]  dr vladimir zemsilinkos our guest with us a little bit the next hour we have another
[3:47:29.640 --> 3:47:34.120]  special guest joining us as well but doctor lay it out for people because you're absolutely right
[3:47:34.120 --> 3:47:37.320]  the ancient things we heard about are exactly what's currently happening now
[3:47:38.760 --> 3:47:44.920]  word where do you see all this going how should we respond to this what other knowledge you want
[3:47:44.920 --> 3:47:52.680]  to lay out for people i'm optimistic about the future i think the true narrative will be revealed
[3:47:54.120 --> 3:47:58.680]  but let me tell you something very serious the only unknown variable here is the body count
[3:47:58.680 --> 3:48:07.640]  until we get there and we can mitigate that carnage by spreading the true narrative and giving people
[3:48:08.520 --> 3:48:16.840]  the right information so they can make good choices everyone has a absolute right to see
[3:48:16.840 --> 3:48:22.280]  both aspects are all the options are all the information about an issue what the media has
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:28.760]  done and what the censorship has done is only give one aspect of one perspective which has led
[3:48:28.760 --> 3:48:35.640]  people to make terrible choices and choices that essentially they choose to walk into a extermination
[3:48:35.640 --> 3:48:46.280]  chamber and so by spreading the true narrative or at least another perspective then people can use
[3:48:46.280 --> 3:48:53.240]  their intellectual powers of analytical thought deductive reasoning and come to a decision whatever
[3:48:53.240 --> 3:48:59.160]  decision they make it's on them you know we have free choice that's very important she got the way
[3:48:59.160 --> 3:49:07.080]  he created the world he gave us two very precious gifts one is consciousness of self and two is
[3:49:07.080 --> 3:49:14.360]  free choice those are two uniquely divine characteristics now for choice to exist
[3:49:14.360 --> 3:49:20.920]  there has to be options now listen if i gave you a hundred dollar bill and a dollar bill and i have
[3:49:20.920 --> 3:49:27.080]  to choose really it's not a choice is it because one is much more attractive than the other and
[3:49:27.080 --> 3:49:36.440]  so for real choice to exist there has to be two options that are as comfortable perceived as
[3:49:36.440 --> 3:49:46.760]  as a real and so good and evil are very real in the consciousness of man but again the idea is that
[3:49:46.760 --> 3:49:53.640]  i'll give you a parable that's used a lot that there is a king and he has a son and the prince
[3:49:53.640 --> 3:50:00.280]  is meant to be king soon but the king loves his people so he wants to make sure that the prince
[3:50:00.280 --> 3:50:10.760]  is a proper moral fiber that he's fitting to rule the people and so he hires or he gets a prostitute
[3:50:11.400 --> 3:50:18.840]  and orders the prostitute to seduce the prince that's that's the parable if we analyze it
[3:50:18.840 --> 3:50:24.520]  i'll ask you a simple question does the king want the prince to sin no does the prostitute
[3:50:24.520 --> 3:50:31.720]  want the prince to sin actually in many ways she's doomed the will of the king and so the answer is
[3:50:31.720 --> 3:50:38.520]  also no and so god creates options but it doesn't mean that he wants us to choose the dark side
[3:50:39.240 --> 3:50:46.520]  he wants us to turn away from bad and to choose him and by doing that we earn for ourselves
[3:50:46.520 --> 3:50:54.760]  the ultimate relationship and oneness with him with the eternal with the incident
[3:50:55.320 --> 3:51:00.920]  and that's amazing because during the finite life of a few number of years we have an opportunity
[3:51:00.920 --> 3:51:07.960]  to connect to the eternal wow it's really amazing and so that's the game that we're playing and so
[3:51:07.960 --> 3:51:13.080]  it's a real game and that was crazy donard interrupt real quick everything the new world
[3:51:13.080 --> 3:51:18.280]  order transhumanist does like follows genesis and like we're going to make you live forever just do
[3:51:18.280 --> 3:51:22.600]  what we say and you're going to have this knowledge but oh everybody else can't do it you got to kill
[3:51:22.600 --> 3:51:27.560]  all these people i mean it's so obvious that it's literally being fulfilled it's powerful
[3:51:28.920 --> 3:51:35.880]  you know the new world order is a rebranding of the oldest old world order of paganism idolatry
[3:51:35.880 --> 3:51:43.640]  and child sacrifice there's nothing new here these uh they call themselves elites or globalists or
[3:51:43.640 --> 3:51:50.280]  illuminated people there's nothing more than just devolved pagans of yesteryear and so
[3:51:51.880 --> 3:51:59.560]  it's very obvious what they are the problem is we have become complacent and we have allowed for
[3:51:59.560 --> 3:52:06.520]  for uh through our choices for the slaughtering of the unborn
[3:52:07.800 --> 3:52:14.760]  desecration of marriage desecration of gender and blasphemy of the creator and what do you think
[3:52:14.760 --> 3:52:23.640]  that's going to bring blessing into the country and so what we need to do is reconcile en masse
[3:52:23.640 --> 3:52:31.560]  with our creator when we cross a certain threshold of of human hearts reconcile them
[3:52:32.120 --> 3:52:39.320]  with their creator with our creator then there'll be a uh real shift a real new world
[3:52:39.320 --> 3:52:44.360]  that's right we have to through free will choose god god consciousness say we're sorry
[3:52:44.360 --> 3:52:51.000]  ask god to help us and that's when things start to change exactly and and and the best way to
[3:52:51.000 --> 3:52:56.680]  do that is to live by by by an example you know you can't preach to others and not do it yourself so
[3:52:57.640 --> 3:53:04.440]  i found i found that the people that i'm drawn to most are those that really are humble and work
[3:53:04.440 --> 3:53:09.640]  on themselves and find a certain degree of serenity and tranquility which is extremely
[3:53:09.640 --> 3:53:14.600]  attractive and especially in the world of chaos and it makes me curious what do they know that i don't
[3:53:14.600 --> 3:53:21.480]  know and so that draws me in into a process of self-retirement so the problem is with modern
[3:53:21.480 --> 3:53:29.560]  day institutions whether it's religious academic political industrial it doesn't really matter
[3:53:29.560 --> 3:53:37.000]  they're all corrupted by the same circuit anything that's institutionalized has been hijacked and so
[3:53:37.000 --> 3:53:42.280]  it's most tragic when when it's in the religious realms because they actually what they do the
[3:53:42.280 --> 3:53:49.320]  one place of salvation is used to uh desecrate the name of god and enslave people i'm i'll only
[3:53:49.320 --> 3:53:53.240]  talk about my religion because i don't feel comfortable talking about others but i've seen
[3:53:53.240 --> 3:54:00.920]  such tyranny in the last two years um uh within the jewish faith you know people couldn't go to
[3:54:00.920 --> 3:54:06.120]  well i mean look at israel there's obviously a new extermination going on it's so obvious
[3:54:07.240 --> 3:54:12.120]  what's happening there you've talked about that to me like the the most oppressed people right now
[3:54:12.120 --> 3:54:17.080]  in the world under cover tyranny are israel and then australia and maybe austria what what's
[3:54:17.080 --> 3:54:25.640]  happening there well half of israel has aids and uh vaccine induced immune deficiency syndrome i didn't
[3:54:25.640 --> 3:54:32.520]  say hib they don't have hib but half of israel they're back their immune systems their innate
[3:54:32.520 --> 3:54:38.360]  immune systems their p cell function natural killer cell function macrophages uh tumor suppressogen
[3:54:38.360 --> 3:54:44.680]  so why so why again is this is the globalist force attacking the jews because i mean it really is
[3:54:44.680 --> 3:54:49.800]  you can see it right there like literally the main attack out of all everywhere is israel that
[3:54:49.800 --> 3:54:56.840]  that's where they're like on their fifth and sixth shots right now so i always delineate the state of
[3:54:56.840 --> 3:55:02.520]  israel from the biblical people of israel uh the two different entities the state of israel is a
[3:55:02.520 --> 3:55:10.440]  secular socialist entity and the jewish people biblically have been uh tasked with the role of
[3:55:10.440 --> 3:55:15.960]  being a light onto the nation's and so you're telling me i'm wrong good jews have been led
[3:55:15.960 --> 3:55:20.360]  there to try to be close to god but the evil runs the political system is not going to try to kill
[3:55:20.360 --> 3:55:27.240]  him oh yes i really think that what a hitler started the israeli government is finishing
[3:55:27.240 --> 3:55:33.000]  wow yeah that's what i see as well this is so diabolical what would you advise israeli to do
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:44.120]  uh revolt civil war to not comply with mandates by the way i'm talking about my own brothers and
[3:55:44.120 --> 3:55:50.520]  sisters literally who have been enslaved and poisoned and poisoned i mean this is not uh
[3:55:50.520 --> 3:55:54.840]  theoretically by me these are these are my relatives oh i've had family die of the shot
[3:55:54.840 --> 3:56:05.640]  dr zlenko i know it's real so i think that family nowadays is a different concept
[3:56:06.280 --> 3:56:11.800]  family i would define as those people that are ideologically or theologically aligned
[3:56:12.920 --> 3:56:22.360]  in trying to live in a world of that consciousness and trying to maintain the possibility of true
[3:56:22.360 --> 3:56:27.240]  a freedom in this world and the people that are walking away from god consciousness are
[3:56:27.240 --> 3:56:34.280]  choosing to enslave themselves to really um sociopaths and they become codependent on this cult
[3:56:35.640 --> 3:56:40.760]  there's only one free type of person in this world alex in my opinion someone who chooses
[3:56:40.760 --> 3:56:42.840]  to be a servant of god that's right
[3:56:42.840 --> 3:56:53.880]  and so i i think each human being is being tested we are being tested god is the flood
[3:56:53.880 --> 3:56:59.080]  waters arising and this time around god is saying get on the ark you don't have to drown
[3:57:00.280 --> 3:57:05.240]  but uh the world will be cleaned up there's no doubt about it oh i agree this thing's not
[3:57:05.240 --> 3:57:11.400]  going to succeed dr zlenko you know we've got zdtoxlife.com or slash alex with your great
