[06:01.640 --> 06:05.920]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[06:05.920 --> 06:09.280]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[06:09.280 --> 06:13.200]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[06:13.200 --> 06:17.400]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[06:17.400 --> 06:21.840]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[06:21.840 --> 06:26.600]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[06:26.600 --> 06:30.400]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[06:30.400 --> 06:34.000]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.320]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[06:38.320 --> 06:41.480]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[06:41.480 --> 06:45.160]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[06:55.480 --> 07:04.200]  1-877-327-0365 most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is
[07:04.200 --> 07:08.320]  the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health most
[07:08.320 --> 07:12.040]  experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of eight or
[07:12.040 --> 07:16.480]  higher alcovision plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most
[07:16.480 --> 07:21.160]  alkaline minerals using plasma pH drops is the best way to make your water
[07:21.160 --> 07:24.960]  alkaline to help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy
[07:24.960 --> 07:29.320]  simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy
[07:29.320 --> 07:33.920]  level alkalizing water helps your body rid itself of acidic waste and increases
[07:33.920 --> 07:38.640]  the oxygen content of your body disease organisms like bacteria viruses and
[07:38.640 --> 07:43.720]  cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high pH environment order your bottle of

[08:00.680 --> 08:06.500]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[08:06.500 --> 08:13.520]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network you know what's
[08:13.520 --> 08:21.360]  happening around the world on this Thursday June 10th 2010 edition you know
[08:21.360 --> 08:27.080]  what's going on trillions of dollars a month in the United States now for over
[08:27.080 --> 08:31.120]  a year and a half and trillions of dollars a month in Europe are being
[08:31.120 --> 08:36.000]  stolen by offshore private central banks namely JP Morgan Chase Goldman Sachs
[08:36.000 --> 08:42.640]  a city bank Wells Fargo and a couple others and they say you're going to pay
[08:42.640 --> 08:48.440]  for all of that money they're being given in taxes and they're raising property
[08:48.440 --> 08:54.880]  taxes business taxes environment taxes energy taxes and while all of this
[08:54.880 --> 09:00.280]  unprecedented bleeding out of society is going on while they're attaching giant
[09:00.280 --> 09:06.000]  balls with chains to your ankles all people are talking about is the Gulf
[09:06.000 --> 09:11.120]  oil spill and it is important and it's on record that the Dutch government and
[09:11.120 --> 09:15.360]  others had all these big ships in the area and we're ready to put out the oil
[09:15.360 --> 09:20.240]  booms in that Florida and Mississippi and Louisiana had their own oil booms
[09:20.240 --> 09:24.720]  there's whole warehouses full of them and the local sheriffs and police and
[09:24.720 --> 09:28.480]  fishermen wanted to put up their own sand berms and just put the booms in
[09:28.480 --> 09:33.720]  front of the rivers and estuaries the the bays the fisheries where the shrimp
[09:33.720 --> 09:37.440]  and the fish breed and that this would have really mitigated most the crisis
[09:37.440 --> 09:43.280]  and it's true the fed said no because they're the boss and they want you to
[09:43.280 --> 09:46.480]  know they're the boss now it's totally unconstitutional they have no
[09:46.480 --> 09:50.920]  jurisdiction until you get about two miles out and then for another 12 miles
[09:50.920 --> 09:57.400]  it's federal waters but the states just roll over stick their thumbs in their
[09:57.400 --> 10:02.520]  mouths get in a fetal position and then whine and say the feds won't let us do
[10:02.520 --> 10:07.200]  it the feds won't let us arrest illegal aliens the feds won't let us have a
[10:07.200 --> 10:11.360]  second amendment the feds won't let us raise our speed limit the feds won't
[10:11.360 --> 10:15.400]  let us wipe our behinds I mean when you go into your house at night you got to
[10:15.400 --> 10:18.080]  use the bathroom I mean I don't mean to be crude here but I mean do you get on
[10:18.080 --> 10:22.040]  the phone and call 911 and say I need an FBI agent to come by I'm about to go to
[10:22.040 --> 10:26.680]  the bathroom can they or or I mean let's be less crude when when you're
[10:26.680 --> 10:31.000]  about to mow your yard do you do you call the Capitol the White House the
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.440]  Congress or federal agency the EPA do you say I'm gonna mow my lawn is that
[10:35.440 --> 10:41.680]  all right when you you know you're 25 you get married you and your wife decide
[10:41.680 --> 10:45.400]  to have kids do you call the government as permission well actually the New
[10:45.400 --> 10:52.240]  York Times yesterday had the Eugenesis Peter Singer calling for no children he
[10:52.240 --> 10:55.600]  was in an editorial in fact guys I lost that in my stack well you reprint that
[10:55.600 --> 10:59.400]  the last-generation article should this be the last generation by a Peter
[10:59.400 --> 11:03.120]  Singer and it's all should we have no children should we get permission from
[11:03.120 --> 11:06.480]  the government well our government lobbied China to put a law in I mean if
[11:06.480 --> 11:09.760]  our government could have its way that's what it do here people running things
[11:09.760 --> 11:13.040]  don't want you to be able to do anything without asking permission and
[11:13.040 --> 11:16.160]  that's what the environmental bill that's passed the House and the Senate
[11:16.160 --> 11:20.760]  will do the carbon tax is monthly home inspections by federally licensed home
[11:20.760 --> 11:25.120]  inspectors in one week if you don't make the changes they say they take your
[11:25.120 --> 11:29.120]  house and by the way I see articles everywhere people are losing their
[11:29.120 --> 11:38.320]  houses for $362 parking bills or toll road bills or or 600 700 thousand
[11:38.320 --> 11:46.680]  dollar property bills or I saw one for a $200 water bill I mean I mean just to
[11:46.680 --> 11:52.720]  look look look here's today okay and I literally printed about 50 articles
[11:52.720 --> 11:56.600]  myself and and I mean this has got to be 200 articles the guys printed I mean I
[11:56.600 --> 12:01.360]  came in here and there's a stack six inches high of news articles that I
[12:01.360 --> 12:06.440]  can't even look at okay in fact I began when I got in here as I do research at
[12:06.440 --> 12:10.080]  home at night research myself and I am I am them the stories I want and that's
[12:10.080 --> 12:15.320]  in one stack I didn't count looks like 40 50 stories I don't know and then I
[12:15.320 --> 12:19.240]  know those articles I read those articles I come in here and they've got
[12:19.240 --> 12:25.840]  probably they at least a hundred articles and so I get it here about 20
[12:25.840 --> 12:29.720]  minutes before showtime I should have got here earlier and I just look at the
[12:29.720 --> 12:34.040]  very top of the stack not in any particular order and this is what it
[12:34.040 --> 12:38.720]  says the news advanced dot com out of Bedford Virginia this is a mainstream
[12:38.720 --> 12:48.040]  newspaper and they're putting up a bust of Stalin at the Veterans Memorial now
[12:48.040 --> 12:52.400]  meanwhile the media tells you communists don't exist but the town has put up a
[12:52.400 --> 12:56.400]  communist memorial for a guy that killed at least 40 million people and now
[12:56.400 --> 13:00.520]  that's the top of the stack I go to the next article that this is stuff I
[13:00.520 --> 13:04.960]  didn't even print I didn't even say this this was emailed into us my crew
[13:04.960 --> 13:12.560]  found this stuff okay this is out of the Star Tribune in jail for being in debt
[13:12.560 --> 13:19.360]  and it says it's a $250 debt and the article says it's not a crime to owe
[13:19.360 --> 13:23.520]  money and debtors prisons were abolished the United States the 19th century but
[13:23.520 --> 13:27.200]  people are routinely being thrown to jail for failing to pay debts and it
[13:27.200 --> 13:30.800]  describes the woman didn't pay a $250 debt that she didn't even know about and
[13:30.800 --> 13:35.280]  she's in jail just like there's no law that you can't film police in open
[13:35.280 --> 13:38.360]  public but there's people being charged with felonies every day because the
[13:38.360 --> 13:41.600]  juries are so dumb they charge them with something completely different and you
[13:41.600 --> 13:47.640]  go to prison folks it's a lawless government see it's lawless and wrong
[13:47.640 --> 13:51.800]  that in 800 plus cities illegal aliens are allowed to drunk drive drive without
[13:51.800 --> 13:54.840]  love drivers license drive without insurance do whatever they want to be
[13:54.840 --> 13:57.840]  released it's not that I hate illegal aliens it's that the government loves
[13:57.840 --> 14:01.880]  them so much and wants them here to drive down wages and be a voting block to
[14:01.880 --> 14:05.760]  vote to ban the Second Amendment and many other things because statistically
[14:05.760 --> 14:08.760]  they vote for big government because they think the government loves them that
[14:08.760 --> 14:13.400]  they can do whatever they want see the government is a bankrupt group of
[14:13.400 --> 14:18.080]  criminals and they're going to rob you they're going to bankrupt you they're
[14:18.080 --> 14:21.080]  gonna bankrupt almost everyone listening they're gonna take your house and
[14:21.080 --> 14:24.440]  they're gonna move in the government scum and the corporations that have
[14:24.440 --> 14:29.240]  grown up around it are predatory gang rapers financial gang rapers you
[14:29.240 --> 14:32.920]  understand that this is the first two articles and I was flipping through it
[14:32.920 --> 14:38.720]  for 20 minutes before airtime it's just each article more insane than the last
[14:38.720 --> 14:45.520]  just wall to wall I'm being sent YouTube videos every day of ads saying do you
[14:45.520 --> 14:49.560]  smell marijuana call the police did your neighbor did you hear your neighbor
[14:49.560 --> 14:54.800]  yell at your yell at their child that's illegal call CPS not illegal it's not
[14:54.800 --> 14:58.400]  abuse our kids are all spoiled rotten because we don't discipline them enough
[14:58.400 --> 15:01.440]  what the globalist told us you don't discipline them so they're a bunch of
[15:01.440 --> 15:04.240]  animals running around wild then when they're out of control the cops taser
[15:04.240 --> 15:08.680]  I'm gonna take them to a prison yeah don't scream at your kids when they run out
[15:08.680 --> 15:12.200]  the street don't discipline them but when they're 14 and ignore what a cop
[15:12.200 --> 15:15.760]  tells them they're gonna get shot in the back and then that's gonna be okay
[15:15.760 --> 15:21.760]  they want to destroy society order out of chaos they want to create disorder so
[15:21.760 --> 15:31.200]  they can bring in their new world order and I'm here looking at these articles
[15:31.200 --> 15:38.080]  look look at this Stalin bust installed at D-Day Memorial Bedford
[15:38.080 --> 15:42.960]  Stalin's bust follows sculptures of Churchill Franklin E. Roosevelt and
[15:42.960 --> 15:47.120]  Harry Truman a bust of dictator Joseph Stalin has been placed at the National
[15:47.120 --> 15:53.200]  D-Day Memorial in Bedford despite public protest over its presence the
[15:53.200 --> 15:58.400]  sculpture was installed at the Memorial Tuesday said so so rushes pulled all
[15:58.400 --> 16:03.360]  their stallings down but but no we put them up here said William Mcintosh
[16:03.360 --> 16:09.560]  president of the Memorial Foundation Richard Pumphrey I want to get one of
[16:09.560 --> 16:13.560]  these people on a Lynchburg college professor and artist finished the piece
[16:13.560 --> 16:18.160]  last year the bust of the reviled Soviet dictators part of a series of allied
[16:18.160 --> 16:30.080]  world leaders who united against Hitler Germany so hey we don't have the right as
[16:30.080 --> 16:34.280]  states to clean the oil up or block it before it got there it's too late many

[25:29.320 --> 25:35.440]  slave come with me to the back and then the woman freaks out and these are just

[25:39.040 --> 25:44.880]  she was gonna be my sex slave or how many of them get caught raping kids in
[25:44.880 --> 25:48.920]  their off time because you're gonna get a percentage of control freaks who

[27:40.960 --> 27:44.840]  complaint with NAACP he probably should I don't know if it was racial but you
[27:44.840 --> 27:52.680]  know the point is this stuff goes on you've all been there if you've traveled

[28:22.800 --> 28:26.000]  looking woman on the scanner and you see the guys all smiling and pointing and
[28:26.000 --> 28:30.520]  laughing and then it turns out TSA workers who are men go through and their

[33:35.840 --> 33:40.720]  you Clinton signed the executive order in 94 10 my first film made 13 years ago
[33:40.720 --> 33:48.680]  in 1997 that they plan to put DNA blood draw facilities in all of the driver's
[33:48.680 --> 33:52.840]  license bureaus and have them federally run and now into the real ID act you
[33:52.840 --> 33:56.600]  know they're federally controlled and now they're talking about police warrant
[33:56.600 --> 34:02.360]  blood draws on the side of the road for DNA databases so the end game here is to
[34:02.360 --> 34:07.200]  get in your body and to train you to submit to anything and everything got
[34:07.200 --> 34:11.920]  another article here out of NBC Chicago troops invade Chicago for training
[34:11.920 --> 34:17.520]  down planes railcar crash simulated terror attack simultaneously planned and
[34:17.520 --> 34:23.080]  they always tell the public after they've had the drill at first locally
[34:23.080 --> 34:27.280]  that they tell people they're really being hit by terrorist to create
[34:27.280 --> 34:32.880]  psychological fear all of America is a giant reeducation camp so I mean this is
[34:32.880 --> 34:39.160]  I'm just going through the stack today so you understand my frustration I am the
[34:39.160 --> 34:42.880]  guys last night this morning probably 50 articles or so over the last few days
[34:42.880 --> 34:47.480]  that I wanted to cover I've sent articles to my webmasters to link to in
[34:47.480 --> 34:54.600]  post I come in here and they've got a massive articles and you go through the
[34:54.600 --> 35:00.160]  stack and just each one is more insane than the next okay that's coming up
[35:00.160 --> 35:04.800]  shifting gears Jim Tucker who is really the icon the granddaddy of exposing the
[35:04.800 --> 35:10.280]  Bilderberg group in the last 33 34 years he's gone from being laughed at being
[35:10.280 --> 35:15.840]  the mainstream media saying it doesn't exist to now the global press admitting
[35:15.840 --> 35:18.680]  that there is a global government and the Bilderberg group is one of the key
[35:18.680 --> 35:26.600]  components of this unelected global corporate system and he did go to Spain
[35:26.600 --> 35:33.600]  to the suburb of Barcelona in Catalonia and Friday had incredible intel for us
[35:33.600 --> 35:37.120]  and so we're going to find out what new info he got Saturday and Sunday and
[35:37.120 --> 35:41.280]  Monday before he left in the aftermath of Bilderberg and ended of course on
[35:41.280 --> 35:45.680]  Sunday officially but really ends on Monday and his take on that and also
[35:45.680 --> 35:50.600]  Mark Anderson who's the deputy editor of American Free Press American Free Press
[35:50.600 --> 35:56.360]  net so both men join us now we're going to debrief them in hindsight and get
[35:56.360 --> 36:00.840]  any new intel that's also coming out in this week's issue of American Free Press
[36:00.840 --> 36:07.640]  Jim Tucker thank you for coming on sir okay if you can recap just the
[36:07.640 --> 36:12.560]  may any other caveats to the majority of Bilderberg group members for the first
[36:12.560 --> 36:20.360]  time greenlighting an attack on Iran any failures they've had any victories they've
[36:20.360 --> 36:25.760]  had anything else on the agenda sir oh yes I really delightful this year if they
[36:25.760 --> 36:31.440]  were so depressed they were depressed as they arrived morning that things are so
[36:31.440 --> 36:41.880]  bad put they always find out and we get in trouble at homes that one so they even
[36:41.880 --> 36:46.920]  as they arrived in their motorcades and helicopters they felt depressed already
[36:46.920 --> 36:53.880]  and as they proceeded they became more depressed so depressed as Mark Anderson
[36:53.880 --> 36:58.040]  found out that instead of leaving on Monday morning as they always have this
[36:58.040 --> 37:02.360]  half a century they've been doing this more than half a century they'd always
[37:02.360 --> 37:08.920]  leave with a farewell breakfast in the morning a farewell speech and all the
[37:08.920 --> 37:12.840]  hands shaking and then they'd leave this time they all left on a Sunday night
[37:12.840 --> 37:17.760]  they were so depressed and that's just wonderful but they still have their evil
[37:17.760 --> 37:26.160]  agenda of course they are very disappointed over the setback in their
[37:26.160 --> 37:33.360]  efforts toward a world government but as you said Bilderberg remains committed to
[37:33.360 --> 37:39.600]  a US attack of Iran on Israel's behalf but they were also very embarrassed by
[37:39.600 --> 37:43.200]  the cruel and clumsy attack on us but till they're bringing food in medicine to
[37:43.200 --> 37:48.120]  the Palestinians in the cosmic strip which backfired so badly we have a
[37:48.120 --> 37:55.320]  separate story on that all together but does relate to Bilderberg and says that
[37:55.320 --> 38:02.160]  the world outrage including from many Jews about the attack the killed innocent
[38:02.160 --> 38:08.960]  people bring food in medicine to Palestine just left Bilderberg gasping
[38:08.960 --> 38:14.280]  but there is the division most Americans in Bilderberg as it was with
[38:14.280 --> 38:19.280]  Tri-Lateral Commission want to go to war want Americans to go to war fill the
[38:19.280 --> 38:24.600]  lifeblood of our young men at the heart's blood of our women and billions of
[38:24.600 --> 38:30.920]  dollars billions would be and fighting such a war well many Europeans are
[38:30.920 --> 38:37.440]  opposed to it and there's some debate over that yet the majority of Bilderberg
[38:37.440 --> 38:46.880]  does favor the US attack on Iran can you flesh that out from your sources I mean
[38:46.880 --> 38:52.640]  any other specifics I mean when you say the majority favors it from my research
[38:52.640 --> 38:57.400]  I mean this is the first time that that they have agreed correct me if I'm
[38:57.400 --> 39:01.640]  wrong and does that mean there will be an attack or from your experience what
[39:01.640 --> 39:07.520]  does that signify just signifies doubt about the whole thing we did report that
[39:07.520 --> 39:16.400]  the that story only invasion of Iran from one of the earlier meetings where
[39:16.400 --> 39:20.960]  they're similar divided some in Europe say no while most Americans and most
[39:20.960 --> 39:26.000]  Europeans they say yes to war and they had this kind of dialogue going on
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.360]  according to sources inside the Bilderberg meeting quote Iran is building
[39:30.360 --> 39:34.400]  nuclear weapons exposed to us that not only to Israel but also to all of
[39:34.400 --> 39:39.800]  Europe and potentially to the United States so the American we're not sure
[39:39.800 --> 39:43.840]  quote we're not sure of that the European counter and you have a lot more
[39:43.840 --> 39:50.640]  dead boys than we do Israel may have to conduct another says that Israel may
[39:50.640 --> 39:55.000]  have to conduct a preemptive strike to protect itself on the nuclear run so
[39:55.000 --> 39:59.600]  the American believe by the inside source to be Keith Alexander director of the
[39:59.600 --> 40:05.520]  National Security Agency but not a positively identified the quote the
[40:05.520 --> 40:10.400]  term preemptive strike was invented by Israel as the son of our ways aggressive
[40:10.400 --> 40:15.320]  war in 1968 European counter Israel bombed Egypt in a surprise attack wiped
[40:15.320 --> 40:19.320]  out there the tip to the Air Force on the ground Israel was under no threat at
[40:19.320 --> 40:22.560]  all said the European the American walk away
[40:22.560 --> 40:28.760]  check you said for the whereabouts they'll look so they're there they're
[40:28.760 --> 40:32.760]  much provided that the tilt is toward board and it's more likely that we could
[40:32.760 --> 40:38.080]  have more than less likely was there any time frame you were able of course of
[40:38.080 --> 40:45.760]  full year plus before the invasion of 2003 of Iraq you were able to point out
[40:45.760 --> 40:51.040]  that when the Washington Post said that oh yes the war is on for this spring 2002
[40:51.040 --> 40:58.560]  you said no they're planning to launch it in the spring of next year 2003 and
[40:58.560 --> 41:02.360]  of course you knew that Donald Graham the publisher was at that Bilderberg
[41:02.360 --> 41:07.520]  group meeting and was knowingly lying to the public and so you were able to get
[41:07.520 --> 41:11.640]  that specific Intel a full year before and publish it in American free press
[41:11.640 --> 41:16.120]  just one of scores of documented instances where we know Bilderberg is
[41:16.120 --> 41:21.240]  steering the planet Jim Tucker were you able to get any time frame from your
[41:21.240 --> 41:29.040]  sources they're hoping to do it in this year of 2010 or perhaps in the fall
[41:29.040 --> 41:36.640]  they're hoping for that you're correct about the time frame of the of the
[41:36.640 --> 41:44.200]  earlier invasion because that shows it how dedicated they are I mean a little
[41:44.200 --> 41:51.160]  Jimmy Lee Hoagland was there too as usual holding Donald Graham's hand and he
[41:51.160 --> 41:56.200]  called associate editor but he delivered that his own staff go ahead and say
[41:56.200 --> 42:04.400]  the war be this spring or early fall it's the latest when he knew that they
[42:04.400 --> 42:08.920]  were wrong he thought that he goes that no don't say anymore don't ask me how I
[42:08.920 --> 42:12.520]  know but he wouldn't even go that far close he's so dedicated to keeping his
[42:12.520 --> 42:16.040]  promise of absolute secrecy to Bilderberg and he calls himself a
[42:16.040 --> 42:22.320]  journalist he's a journalist the core what do you make of David from of
[42:22.320 --> 42:27.320]  course to come up with the term axis of evil and who is routinely demonizing
[42:27.320 --> 42:32.680]  Rand Paul and myself in the national post two days ago just saying yeah they're
[42:32.680 --> 42:36.520]  former Nazis at Bilderberg and yeah they're globalist but we're not setting
[42:36.520 --> 42:40.080]  up a world government it's a conspiracy theory I guess he's breaking
[42:40.080 --> 42:48.480]  Bilderberg rules well I'll say so many times I do not advocate a conspiracy
[42:48.480 --> 42:54.520]  theory recognize conspiracy fact and there's no way with what jurisdiction
[42:54.520 --> 42:59.160]  can you build a break be described as anything else but conspiracy did you see
[42:59.160 --> 43:02.480]  our report from prisonplanet.com I know you were probably on a plane when it was
[43:02.480 --> 43:08.200]  published two days ago but the former head of NATO gave a national interview
[43:08.200 --> 43:14.880]  in Holland and it was also broadcast in other areas of Europe and admitted he
[43:14.880 --> 43:20.160]  was the head of NATO in a 94 and 95 and he said yes we go there and the globalist
[43:20.160 --> 43:24.040]  set policy the private corporations tell us what to do and then we go out and
[43:24.040 --> 43:28.160]  implement it and that dovetails with the SPP documents judicial got watch
[43:28.160 --> 43:32.920]  gotten 2007 well that they sued to get from the Banff Canada North American
[43:32.920 --> 43:37.880]  Union meeting where it was the private corporations the Fortune 60 or so who
[43:37.880 --> 43:42.560]  set the agenda and then the heads of state and the heads of the state
[43:42.560 --> 43:46.080]  departments of Mexico Canada in the US then go and implement it I mean we know
[43:46.080 --> 43:53.360]  how this works yes they follow orders and as you know in Europe has the state
[43:53.360 --> 43:58.040]  also attended the United States that's not possible because white-ass reporters
[43:58.040 --> 44:06.480]  giving up paperback Western novels each day accounting for every moment of
[44:06.480 --> 44:12.040]  present time none of 3 a.m. condom basketball none of IBM fell off in
[44:12.040 --> 44:17.600]  Skindney I mean every moment of his time even for this recreational time is the
[44:17.600 --> 44:23.320]  county far so there's no way the fight has to explain up to just this very
[44:23.320 --> 44:29.760]  far even a few hours at a billaberg meeting so that's not true in Europe
[44:29.760 --> 44:35.240]  it has a state of 10 and they all and as you know how officials our State
[44:35.240 --> 44:39.960]  Department Defense Department Treasury and the White House always attend that's
[44:39.960 --> 44:45.080]  part of it too and they follow orders like a dog to the whistle well here's
[44:45.080 --> 44:49.400]  the headline former NATO Secretary General in Mitz Bilderberg sets global
[44:49.400 --> 44:54.320]  policy and we have actually a link to the national radio interview where he
[44:54.320 --> 45:01.840]  talked about it he's Willie Klase just absolutely incredible I I want to go to
[45:01.840 --> 45:06.480]  Mark Anderson who your cohort who was there with you in four days at
[45:06.480 --> 45:09.520]  Bilderberg here in a moment but but we've got you guys for another 15 minutes
[45:09.520 --> 45:14.080]  so I want to continue with Jim for a moment Jim was there anything from your
[45:14.080 --> 45:19.360]  sources discussed by Bilderberg about the BP spill in the Gulf because I
[45:19.360 --> 45:23.780]  know BP in the past has been a big carbon tax promoter and Queen Beatrix of
[45:23.780 --> 45:31.320]  course is one of the big owners of it yes there is some discussion let me tell
[45:31.320 --> 45:38.480]  my my mother's gonna get more gasoline taxes are expected
[45:41.080 --> 45:45.040]  look I'm just having to reach into my memory now my nose are all scattered all
[45:45.040 --> 45:49.200]  over no I understand Jim take your time in fact in fact in fact cover
[45:49.200 --> 45:52.720]  other issues I know you have your notebook in front of you want to go back
[45:52.720 --> 45:57.360]  to exactly what they said from your sources other intel that you learned
[45:57.360 --> 46:02.600]  since Friday on Saturday and Sunday other things that you learned from your
[46:02.600 --> 46:06.920]  sources that we didn't cover Friday I think we talked about gas price on
[46:06.920 --> 46:11.240]  Friday did we talk about disarming Americans not not much because you
[46:11.240 --> 46:17.600]  didn't have your notes flesh that out well I'll build very well celebrate
[46:17.600 --> 46:21.960]  one victory on their orders because Obama signed off on an international
[46:21.960 --> 46:27.360]  treaty promising disarm Americans now there's no chance to say it with the
[46:27.360 --> 46:33.400]  Senate would radicalize such radicalism but if a more left-wing Senate is
[46:33.400 --> 46:38.480]  a lost election this year 2012 there would be reason for concern and also
[46:38.480 --> 46:45.400]  the possibility he'll pull in George Bush and signing called an agreement not
[46:45.400 --> 46:52.920]  a treaty but it's really obviously a treaty but as you know a treaty under
[46:52.920 --> 46:57.640]  our Constitution is the supreme law of the land and that's why George Washington
[46:57.640 --> 47:04.880]  is also strongly against it but if we abide by what's called the UN small
[47:04.880 --> 47:10.800]  arms treaty that would allow international bureaucrats that come
[47:10.800 --> 47:20.960]  into your home and take your gun away and there well in the words of the former
[47:20.960 --> 47:25.960]  UN ambassador John Bolton quote the administration knows it cannot obtain
[47:25.960 --> 47:29.760]  this kind of legislation purely domestic context they will use an
[47:29.760 --> 47:33.240]  international agreement if excuse to get domestically how they could not get
[47:33.240 --> 47:41.960]  other could not get otherwise so now this country was completely backed up by
[47:41.960 --> 47:46.240]  the mainstream media United States but they had the same access to the
[47:46.240 --> 47:50.840]  information that I did but they just it's not very good they just do not want
[47:50.840 --> 47:54.160]  to report it absolutely they don't report on a lot of big things that are
[47:54.160 --> 47:57.520]  happening legislatively or they say oh the government can't take over
[47:57.520 --> 48:01.560]  health care and then they do it so really there's a lot of playing possum
[48:01.560 --> 48:07.480]  here specifically on other issues you were saying Friday that they're very
[48:07.480 --> 48:11.040]  dejected in that one Bilderberg group member can you tell us the name said
[48:11.040 --> 48:25.240]  we're about whipped on this yeah and if the euro goes down if the euro goes
[48:25.240 --> 48:31.880]  belly up and they're economists in Europe are saying it will go up we were
[48:31.880 --> 48:36.400]  just lost off one of them said well I'm going back to my memory now because
[48:36.400 --> 48:42.760]  the notes I'm not the most neat I don't have any desk on earth I suppose but they
[48:42.760 --> 48:48.960]  were very concerned about the euro actually going belly up and also when
[48:48.960 --> 48:59.400]  the group of 20 met in Japan just shortly before this meeting they gave up
[48:59.400 --> 49:07.360]  on establishing a global bank taxis just couldn't do it so that was that is
[49:07.360 --> 49:10.640]  international currency and international bank tax are crucial to
[49:10.640 --> 49:13.760]  Bilderberg's plan to establish a World Treasury Department which they're still
[49:13.760 --> 49:20.800]  preparing to do well I've noticed whether it's Copenhagen or quote financial
[49:20.800 --> 49:25.080]  reform it's always the same treaty that's for governments to hand over
[49:25.080 --> 49:28.280]  their power to private central banks they can create a public world
[49:28.280 --> 49:33.560]  government and and they're failing on every front this has got to be a really
[49:33.560 --> 49:38.200]  exciting news for you Jim oh yes we're celebrating it but it's not time for you
[49:38.200 --> 49:42.160]  to rattle mark enters its cage isn't it absolutely stay there Jim because I want
[49:42.160 --> 49:45.400]  to come back to you in a moment and we're about to go to break dig around
[49:45.400 --> 49:49.120]  on your notes for other key points that we haven't gotten into yet specifically
[49:49.120 --> 49:54.560]  on that BP oil spill and and what they think of Barack Obama too I had heard
[49:54.560 --> 49:58.920]  that you got some intel on that as well but going to mark Anderson mark what
[49:58.920 --> 50:05.600]  else did you learn over the weekend and now in hindsight well a number of things
[50:05.600 --> 50:10.200]  can you hear me okay yeah you're on a speakerphone aren't you yeah that type
[50:10.200 --> 50:14.960]  thing through Skype anyway one interesting development is all the calls
[50:14.960 --> 50:19.320]  that me and Jim and other reporters made to the Hotel Dolce where the
[50:19.320 --> 50:24.040]  Bilderberg insiders met were finally responded to not with a press conference
[50:24.040 --> 50:28.760]  not with a emailed press release but by the creation of what appears to be
[50:28.760 --> 50:35.560]  Bilderberg's first ever website and it's got all their Bilderberg speech it's
[50:35.560 --> 50:40.880]  it's it's got past releases they put out so it appears to be the Bilderberg

[53:17.840 --> 53:24.520]  likely with each passing day think it can't happen here executive order 10,990

[54:19.520 --> 54:25.920]  Jim though Mark deputy editor there at americanfreepress.net finishing up yeah
[54:25.920 --> 54:30.440]  so it appears Bilderberg has now put out its first I guess 21st century
[54:30.440 --> 54:36.880]  website so very interesting yes it is and what I see in this is they they
[54:36.880 --> 54:40.920]  finally had to bend all the pressure here they were their second time in
[54:40.920 --> 54:44.560]  Spain and their whole history but the first time spain Spanish media has
[54:44.560 --> 54:48.680]  ever given them any coverage in any heat and as Jim described they're at this
[54:48.680 --> 54:54.120]  critical impasse this critical juncture in their plans and this was a really bad
[54:54.120 --> 54:58.120]  time for them to get a lot of media coverage from their point of view so
[54:58.120 --> 55:03.320]  this this new website of theirs is more than just kind of a sundry development
[55:03.320 --> 55:06.880]  it shows that they're they're getting their arm bent behind their back a little
[55:06.880 --> 55:12.040]  bit and we're catching them at a bad time on on their terms and they didn't
[55:12.040 --> 55:17.560]  need that all this heat right now and we gave it to them and the the media
[55:17.560 --> 55:22.200]  coverage unfortunately did not sustain in Europe as much as I had hoped all
[55:22.200 --> 55:25.480]  right mark I'm going to come back to you in just a moment but to finish up with
[55:25.480 --> 55:30.120]  Jim Jim I talked to you last Friday and you agreed that this was the biggest
[55:30.120 --> 55:37.960]  route of Bilderberg ever do you still follow that line oh absolutely and well
[55:37.960 --> 55:44.640]  I found that I was looking for before inside the Bilderbergs they were saying
[55:44.640 --> 55:48.360]  that the United States society American society needs to be quote European eyes
[55:48.360 --> 55:52.120]  and the new health care reform legislation is quote a significant step
[55:52.120 --> 55:57.200]  quote but more must be done well of course they were looking back at
[55:57.200 --> 56:01.600]  nations such as Greece's financial straits because of the government
[56:01.600 --> 56:06.280]  provided happy lifetime jobs unable to find confidence in a tired age that you
[56:06.280 --> 56:11.840]  with full benefits but they placed your opinionizing on Obama's agenda and I
[56:11.840 --> 56:15.920]  quit I was like far before it was from Henry Kissinger if could if the euro is
[56:15.920 --> 56:20.960]  lost our cause is lost could kids who told Bilderberg colleagues on 30 June
[56:20.960 --> 56:29.360]  five around in some golf states are W. E. Rowe and buying bullion one quote
[56:29.360 --> 56:34.400]  after you five if space economy collapses for you the EU countries would be
[56:34.400 --> 56:38.800]  under pressure to themselves abandoned the euro quote we just can't let that
[56:38.800 --> 56:40.920]  happen
[56:40.920 --> 56:46.080]  responded another as Rockefeller Teter going to Spain not it didn't agree with
[56:46.080 --> 56:55.200]  so other efforts to turn the United States into the and to the American
[56:55.200 --> 57:00.280]  Union are their ambitions are undebated they're losing on that front is
[57:00.280 --> 57:04.920]  they're losing on almost all fronts but they're still determined to pursue that
[57:04.920 --> 57:09.040]  evil and as they still got control the central banks and they can still rob us
[57:09.040 --> 57:14.480]  blind but but it appears Jim do you agree the tide is turning but that makes
[57:14.480 --> 57:18.880]  him even more dangerous wanting to launch a major war as a political way to
[57:18.880 --> 57:25.840]  unify the people yes and the reason they're being set back is because of
[57:25.840 --> 57:30.640]  the growing awareness even though of Americans because in this country if
[57:30.640 --> 57:36.480]  you're not it's a smaller independently family-owned newspapers and independent
[57:36.480 --> 57:40.400]  broadcast stations that do give it because it well like your own
[57:40.400 --> 57:45.800]  broadcast out they give it a good serious attention so that Joe Sixpack is
[57:45.800 --> 57:52.200]  growing more and more aware and that one Bill and Bert kids said earlier they
[57:52.200 --> 57:55.200]  get in trouble when they go home that's why Congress but no to tend anymore
[57:55.200 --> 58:01.320]  because got too much flack from their constituents and they've said so anything
[58:01.320 --> 58:08.680]  on BP jamming that in the in the 60 seconds we've got left yes I was okay
[58:08.680 --> 58:16.120]  well I do recall that there is a their prediction that yes we'll have to it's
[58:16.120 --> 58:22.320]  one cost of some money gas prices will have to stay down the United States for
[58:22.320 --> 58:26.880]  a while but go up and later but we'll overcome this with the biggest bill we've
[58:26.880 --> 58:33.160]  ever had that will overcome it and and we will make money the things like that
[58:33.160 --> 58:42.840]  even though their competitors great job great job Jim Tucker thank you for
[58:42.840 --> 58:50.920]  listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN live comm today the question is where
[58:50.920 --> 58:55.800]  should the American people draw their line in the sand what have we got a

[59:01.080 --> 59:05.480]  minority rights not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on
[59:05.480 --> 59:08.800]  what's for dinner so they think they own our land they think they're on our water
[59:08.800 --> 59:14.720]  children our education our money we have to define who we are and what we will
[59:14.720 --> 59:20.800]  tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the patriot uprising we

[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:27.800]  well amazing information from Jim Tucker and he's very careful to go directly
[01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:32.360]  off his notes from his sources finishing up with Mark Anderson deputy
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.800]  editor of American Free Press you'll learn even more in this week's issue
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.560]  that's about to come out it's a once a week newspaper and a lot of key
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:43.400]  information there and you can't get better info than anywhere else on
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:48.440]  Bilderberg you can subscribe in American Free Press net Mark finishing in any
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:52.800]  other intel points that Jim forgot to cover that you want to go over or
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:56.440]  anything else that you gleaned that's important for this worldwide audience to
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:02.360]  hear today well one thing Jim mentioned I also got from a decent source and that
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:09.280]  is the Iran situation where Iran is reportedly dumping the euro and buying
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:14.600]  gold bullion there's also a little additional point that they might switch
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:19.640]  to the dollar as well as gold that's just a little item that didn't happen to
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.320]  get mentioned by Jim yeah that was on actually press TV about two weeks ago
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:28.520]  so Bilderberg was talking about that the official government channel said that
[01:01:28.520 --> 01:01:34.640]  two weeks ago yeah what what you see here Alex I think is a pattern where Iran
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:39.240]  is among those nations that doesn't want to join the global matrix they might
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:42.680]  want to have more energy independence they might want to have more financial
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.960]  independence and they're not part of the global core or you might say and what
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:51.800]  what the Bilderberg planning commission does and that's what it is a planning
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:56.760]  commission is they look for nations that are recalcitrant those that don't want
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:02:03.440]  to join the global matrix and the these nations are ostracized and basically
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.880]  forcibly annexed into the system and I think that they just see Iran that the
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:14.440]  you know ancient Persia a country with an incredible history they just see it
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:18.680]  as this renegade nation when in fact they're really no tangible threat at all
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:23.400]  by any logical means and that's why American Free Press ran the full text
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:27.520]  or much of it from the Iranian leader when he spoke to the United Nations a
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:32.960]  few weeks back so people would actually knew what he said and not tell us what
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.360]  he said and distort everything because going to war with Iran would be a
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:40.520]  terrible tragedy across the board and drain us have even more blood and
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:45.240]  treasure and if that's on the Bilderberg agenda that has to be the utmost thing to
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.240]  oppose and expose well I want to be clear from what I've the intel I got from you
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.440]  skeleton Tucker and and other really good sources plus we can see the
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:58.040]  Bilderberg group members saying on the world stage they are in trouble their
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.840]  agenda is in trouble but they were already in control of almost every nation
[01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.960]  on earth they're just trying to expand that control so we're not saying we're
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:09.760]  out of the woods we're simply saying these people are not invincible some
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:13.680]  people spend it and say oh Alex is saying everything's fixed or some people
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:18.360]  are spending it and saying you know Alex is you know telling us we've won no I'm
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:23.200]  just reporting the facts that every indicator we've got shows that this
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:28.720]  global empire is having control problems they're having problems maintaining
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:32.600]  control and they're having bigger problems expanding control mark Anderson
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.600]  you agree yes I do I think the the pivotal timing as I mentioned earlier of
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:42.040]  all this heavy media coverage in a place like Spain really caught him off guard
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:45.840]  there's every indication they left a little early that they were kind of
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:49.160]  smoked out of there they were already having trouble they wanted their new
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:54.520]  world order 10 years ago according to Jim Tucker this is not to say they're not
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:58.280]  invincible but they're not beat either I think you've got it right it's somewhere
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:04.400]  in between that's what all our sources are telling us it's it was an amazing
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.080]  burden on Spain and on their public purse to have this that didn't help them
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.320]  either yeah that's big news it's in the major Spanish papers that the Catalonian
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.400]  police said we do not want to be forced to guard these people they should have
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:21.280]  hired their own security yeah and so they public relations wise build a bird
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:26.360]  came out really smelling bad and what this will do is make it so other host
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:31.280]  nations will be a little bit more hesitant about hosting such a you know
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:36.920]  kind of tarnished group you know who who wants who wants how Dracula to visit

[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:48.440]  They can't use it as a way of hammering the industry which powers our economies.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:58.440]  I'm writing a book about the subject at the moment. We are effectively fighting a massive ideological war.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:08.440]  It is between those of us who believe in freedom, in liberty, in government staying out of our lives
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:18.440]  We believe that the world is doomed unless we can impose some kind of new world order.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:28.440]  The green movement is being used to give fuel to that particular argument.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:38.440]  The green movement is being used to give fuel to that particular argument.
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:48.440]  The green movement is being used to give fuel to that particular argument.
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:58.440]  James, looking into your crystal ball, where do you see this ending? Where is all this leading?
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:04.440]  Is it just going to be an endless 100 year oil leak? They are now saying it may last another year.
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:10.440]  No one is allowed to touch it. BP is God and no one takes responsibility.
[01:18:10.440 --> 01:18:20.440]  They are the biggest contributors. They are a darling of the Obamanoids. Every time an airport opens a magazine, it is BP, global governance, global carbon tax ads.
[01:18:20.440 --> 01:18:30.440]  You have Queen Beatrix, who owns part of it, prancing around, who is part of the Bilderberg group. This is incredible.
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:40.440]  Certainly, despite being British, I have no sympathy whatsoever with BP for precisely that reason you give.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:48.440]  Nobody has been more assiduous in advancing the anthropogenic global warming agenda than BP.
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:54.440]  The greenies are always talking about how big oil is financing people like you and me.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:19:08.440]  I wish I was financed by Big Oil. The fact is that long ago, Big Oil started moving into funding the climate hysterics, people who believe in global warming.
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:18.440]  I have never received one cent from Big Oil. I own no stock. I guess I do have some cousins that have these little Texas wells where you get about $1,000 a month if you are lucky.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:28.440]  But that is about as big a connection as I have to Big Oil. This is insane. Meanwhile, Big Oil is always pushing it.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:37.440]  It is a source of great sadness to me, Alex. There is no doubt it is to you that Big Oil refuses to fund my lifestyle despite the fact that I love oil.
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:44.440]  I am constantly writing about how oil is great. We need gas for our cars. We need cheap gas.
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:51.440]  Exactly. In fact, I want to say this. Big Oil wants to sponsor me because I take sponsorship if I believe in it.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:20:00.440]  I am ready for Big Oil sponsorship. We will have ads publicly on the air and admit we are financed by Big Oil. Give us the money.
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:03.440]  You have seen our SinoFresh banner on the GCN website.

[01:24:00.440 --> 01:24:14.440]  James Dillingpole is our guest and all these other incredible things are happening in the world. I listen to talk radio, I watch the news, all they talk about is the oil spill.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:27.440]  And a lot of times, if it's Anna Nicole Smith or O.J. Simpson or Michael Jackson, it's artificial media hype because my callers to my show aren't calling in about it.
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:33.440]  Because most of the time we just open the phones up and people can call in them with whatever issue they want.
[01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:46.440]  And normally if something, people aren't calling in about Marinus Vanderloop. People aren't calling in about the other media hype that's going on, but they are calling in about this oil spill when I'm not even covering that subject.
[01:24:46.440 --> 01:25:00.440]  And they're getting more and more angry, but what I'm getting angry at is hearing gentle and others keep whining and saying the feds won't let us do this.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:05.440]  It's called the Tenth Amendment, Ninth Amendment. It's time for them to push the feds aside.
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:14.440]  And if some BP employees pull up and say we've got federal authority and they start trying to push people around, I mean, you know, it needs to stop.
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:25.440]  Yeah. The thing is, Alex, you have to look at the history of the green movement to understand that there is nothing that green is like better than a nice juicy oil spill.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:35.440]  And the reason they like a nice juicy oil spill is because it presents them with ready-made images of seagulls, you know, seabirds covered in black.
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:44.440]  It gives them a sort of excuse for audiences to circumvent thought and really feel about how awful, how bad oil is.
[01:25:44.440 --> 01:25:55.440]  And I'll give you an example of this. You know, Earth Day, that event that was founded in 1970 by a U.S. sort of eco-tard senator called, I think, Gaylord Nelson was it?
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:26:07.440]  That was Earth Day, which was the birth of the modern environmental movement, was inspired by the Santa Barbara oil spill of 1969.
[01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:15.440]  So you see, every time there's an oil spill, the greens are secretly laughing because it's their perfect excuse to advance their agenda.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.440]  And this latest incident is no exception.
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:31.440]  Well, let me ask you that then. I mean, I'm saying all the evidence points towards false flag. I'm not sure that's the case, but more and more it appears that there's some hanky-panky going on.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:40.440]  Bare minimum, they're doing everything they can to let it continue to pour. I mean, at your gut level, James, are you starting to think something's rotten in the state of the Gulf?
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:50.440]  Look, my immediate reaction when I read a bit about it was, yeah, that there was some kind of sabotage involved, but I've got no proof of that.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:55.440]  It could just be, you know, cock up rather than conspiracy. I mean, of course they've got the motive to do this.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:01.440]  Well, why did Obama say we're going to send SWAT teams at first? Maybe it was some green movement organization.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:05.440]  Why did this happen a month after he approved of drilling?
[01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:11.440]  Yeah, as I said, there are lots of people out there who would have cause to do this kind of thing.
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:19.440]  I still believe, you know, having talked to people who work in the oil industry, that it would be quite hard to sabotage a thing like this.
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:31.440]  So I think it's still more like to be an accident. Either way, it doesn't really matter what matters is the way it's being abused, exploited by Obama and the green movement to advance their agenda,
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:37.440]  which in my book is a very sinister agenda. And look, we put this oil spill in perspective.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:52.440]  During the Second World War, five million tons, five million tons of petroleum were spilled in the Atlantic by tankers sunk by Nazi submarines between 1942 and 1945.
[01:27:52.440 --> 01:28:02.440]  So averaged over 1,000 days, the loss is equivalent to two to five times the oil now spilled in the Gulf of Mexico every day for the duration of the war.
[01:28:02.440 --> 01:28:08.440]  Yeah, those wolf packs were sinking sometimes 20 ships in one day.
[01:28:08.440 --> 01:28:17.440]  Yeah, and unfortunately, there were no green ecoconvoys to be torpedoed at the same time, because that would have done us all an enormous favor, but they weren't around in those days.
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:22.440]  People had had bigger issues to worry about.
[01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:31.440]  I tell you, where do you see this going? I mean, Obama has said he wants a new tax to pay for the Gulf, but it's going to be a new carbon tax on everybody's gasoline.
[01:28:31.440 --> 01:28:43.440]  Yes, yes. Well, I mean, this is the real tragedy about this tragedy, which is that up until this point, Obama's cap and trade was dead in the water.
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:54.440]  Nobody in the Senate was going to vote for this nonsense because they saw that, you know, how unpopular healthcare, Obamacare was, and they weren't going to take the same risk twice.
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:09.440]  Suddenly, there's a glimmer of hope that Obama might be able to advance this crazy, crazy cap and trade tax, which is going to tax every American for the amount of CO2 they produce.
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:13.440]  They're going to tax industry, they're going to tax individuals through their energy bills.
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:23.440]  And he's openly coupled that legislation to this and is selling it now as an oil cleanup bill. What is the same legislation?
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.440]  Yeah, well, crisis opportunity. I mean, go figure.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:36.440]  James, stay there. I want to continue to flesh this out with you and take calls from listeners specifically on the oil spill, on the carbon tax and gas tax legislation,
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:48.440]  and what the public out there thinks is behind this and your questions for James Dillingpole, JamesDillingpole.com, 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:14.440]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:19.440]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:27.440]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:31.440]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:35.440]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:40.440]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:30:40.440 --> 01:30:45.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:11.440]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:16.440]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:23.440]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:29.440]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:33.440]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:38.440]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:44.440]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:47.440]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:50.440]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:30.440]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:34.440]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:40.440]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.

[01:33:45.440 --> 01:33:53.440]  Basically, this is like garlic and crosses and sunlight to these people running our government.
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:34:02.440]  And we've got all the 20-plus films I've produced and more than 100 books and videos that I have read or watched and that I think are informative.
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:08.440]  That's what's in the store, stuff that I'm into, stuff that I think is the best research out there.
[01:34:08.440 --> 01:34:10.440]  So please peruse it.
[01:34:10.440 --> 01:34:22.440]  Everything there I certify as being information that I think is valuable for what that's worth, but only the best of the best in my perspective at infowars.com.
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.440]  And secondarily, your purchase of the books, the videos, the t-shirts also funds this operation.
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:29.440]  I'm not funded by the oil companies.
[01:34:29.440 --> 01:34:35.440]  I'm not funded by the Ford Foundation, like all the big leftist publications that lie about me every day.
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:45.440]  I'm not funded by General Electric and the bomb makers like Chris Matthews with this big hit piece about me and Rand Paul that we have a script of now that's worse than I thought coming out next Wednesday.
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.440]  Now, we're funded by you, the listeners.
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.440]  I am funded by you.
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:51.440]  You decide if we grow.
[01:34:51.440 --> 01:34:53.440]  You decide if we survive.
[01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:56.440]  You decide the future of this operation.
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:16.440]  So again, infowars.com in order don't tread on me, the Barry Sataro, Barack Obama, t-shirts, Invisible Empire, a new order defined, the Obama deception, in-game blueprint for global enslavement, the secret team by Fletcher Proudy, now republished for the first time in decades,
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:29.440]  Jesse Ventura's new book, American Conspiracy, massively discounted, you get a free film of your choice when you order the book for a limited time because I've almost sold out and then once they sell out, I'm going to buy a few more and keep it in the shopping cart, but stop that discount.
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:37.440]  All available at infowars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:52.440]  We're going to go to John, Jack, Truth, Patriot, Denny, Ron, and others here in a moment for James Dillingpole, but James, about a year before Obama got in office, you know, you were already speaking out against him and you could see that he was the heir apparent.
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:56.440]  And then right after you had elected, you had your book out about Obama land.
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:08.440]  I mean, he really is scary because this isn't just some corrupt Richard Nixon doing bad things and it's not some George Herbert Walker Bush, you know, launching, you know, wars, which is bad enough.
[01:36:08.440 --> 01:36:14.440]  I mean, this guy is really trying to overthrow the government, trying to overthrow our system.
[01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:26.440]  And Elena Kagan, they're blocking most of her papers, but the papers we've gotten from just a few years ago say ban the Second Amendment, ban private property, ban free speech.
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.440]  You've got all these White House czars saying ban free speech.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:34.440]  You've got the FTC saying ban free speech whenever we want.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:40.440]  I mean, we are literally becoming the Soviet Union here and I guess so is England to a great respect.
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:44.440]  I mean, what is it like to actually watch this happening?
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:54.440]  I say to you, welcome to the suck because, you know, we have been experiencing this problem for, well, I mean, we've just lived under 13 years of socialism under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:37:03.440]  We belong to the EU SSR, you know, I mean, the European Union is effectively a milder version of the old Soviet Union.
[01:37:03.440 --> 01:37:09.440]  You know, it's all about regulation by unelected bureaucrats.
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:15.440]  The reason I wrote that book, Welcome to Obama Land is I knew your future.
[01:37:15.440 --> 01:37:17.440]  I could see it coming because I'd already experienced it.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.440]  You know, I know how socialists work.
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:27.440]  I know that President Obama is a socialist and he's got an administration stuff with people even worse than socialists.
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:36.440]  You know, particularly, you know, people like John Holdren, Carol Branagh, you know, half your Van Jones, for example.
[01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:43.440]  You know, these are the kind of people who do not like concepts like liberty.
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:49.440]  They do not like the American way because the American way is about self determination.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:52.440]  It is about, you know, personal responsibility.
[01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.440]  And these people do not believe in that kind of stuff.
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:57.440]  They believe in big government.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:37:59.440]  They believe in control.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:01.440]  The more control, the better.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:09.440]  You know, until you get rid of Obama and pray God that you do, you are going to see more and more of this stuff happening.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:12.440]  Well, we now have set up debtor prisons again in the U.S.
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:21.440]  The Star Tribune reports a woman arrested for a non-crime, for an unpaid $250 debt.
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:25.440]  Here's another one at the Maine Veterans Cemetery in Virginia.
[01:38:25.440 --> 01:38:33.440]  They've put up a huge plaque of Joseph Stalin. In fact, I'll give PrisonPlanet.tv viewers a document cam shot of this while James is talking about it.
[01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:45.440]  There's a Wall Street Journal article today saying that Americans who don't want to be strip searched on top of the naked body scanners in front of people are vain.
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:54.440]  And so the control freaks, call them socialists, fascists, you know, big government people, they always love to push the limit.
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:39:01.440]  I mean, they're really trying to break our will and make us submit to anything.
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.440]  Certainly are, yeah.
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:09.440]  No, I agree entirely with your analysis about, you know, socialist, communist, fascist.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:12.440]  They are all part of the same instinct.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:22.440]  This is ultimately the battle we're fighting between libertarians like you and me, and I think you're listeners, and people who want to control stuff.
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:27.440]  And, you know, they're going to increasingly try and shut us down.
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:32.440]  They're going to find ways of controlling the Internet. They're going to find ways of controlling talk radio.
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:35.440]  And we're going to have to fight for this stuff.
[01:39:35.440 --> 01:39:41.440]  And by the way, they're now proposing this. This isn't just a few academics a decade ago talking about it.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:47.440]  This is all over the news, and they're calmly putting it forward saying, oh, yeah.
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:54.440]  By the way, we're going to start taxing alternative news sites and giving it to the old line newspapers.
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:40:02.440]  I mean, that was actually proposed last week by the Federal Trade Commission. That is absolute robbery.
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:09.440]  Yeah, well, of course, I mean, this is what they do. They're going to use money and power to try and destroy us.
[01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:15.440]  You know, we are the X-wing fighter pilots fighting against the Death Star, and the Death Star is very big.
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:19.440]  And Darth Vader is in charge, you know. This is a tough battle.
[01:40:19.440 --> 01:40:26.440]  Well, I guess that's like the BBC, where they don't fund James Dillingpole to write for a private newspaper,
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:31.440]  but they tax everyone to pay for BBC brainwashing.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:37.440]  Yeah, I'm glad you made that point. We have to pay annual license fee. I forgot what it is now.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:46.440]  It's about getting off at $200 in order to fund an organization which promotes a view of the world,
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:49.440]  which is essentially of the liberal left.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:57.440]  You know, no organization has been pushing harder for ATW, man-made global warming, than the BBC.
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:41:02.440]  And the reason for that is, well, one reason, apart from its essentially liberal ideology anyway,
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:09.440]  is that the BBC's pension fund is exposed massively to the carbon trading market,
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:15.440]  which of course, as we know, Al Gore is heavily involved in, Goldman Sachs are heavily involved in.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:21.440]  They can't afford for anthropogenic global warming to collapse because their pension fund will collapse too.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:25.440]  In fact, we've now seen the second wave of propaganda.
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:32.440]  Every issue of Newsweek, Time Magazine, New York Times, National Geographic,
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:34.440]  the global warming's worse than we thought.
[01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:38.440]  We're all going to be dead in three years on the coastlines if we don't do this.
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:43.440]  Meanwhile, Al Gore just bought a giant mansion right on the beach,
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:48.440]  and we do see the stock on carbon trading companies going down.
[01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:52.440]  And the word is from the Bilderberg group, from our inside sources,
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:57.440]  is that one member said, we're just about whipped on our global warming tax scheme.
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:06.440]  So I don't think that the king's horses or the king's men can put their global warming tax scam back together again.
[01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:11.440]  Well, we have truth justice. We have the facts on our side.
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:16.440]  They unfortunately have the structures that have been built over the years
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:21.440]  by organizations like the Club of Rome, which I'm sure your listeners are familiar with.
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:27.440]  When you've got organizations like the Gorbachev Foundation, the Club of Rome,
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:31.440]  the Club of Budapest, the Club of Madrid, the entire United Nations,
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:37.440]  the entire European Union, the leaders of pretty much every major Western economy,
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:41.440]  including David Cameron, of course you've got Barack Obama.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:47.440]  When you've got all these people supporting the idea of man-made global warming
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:52.440]  and imposing new tax and regulation to deal with it, you have a serious problem.
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:59.440]  Even if you've got the facts on your side, how do you resist the state?
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.440]  And they're not stopping. I mean, they don't care if their approval ratings go down.
[01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:07.440]  They don't care if you don't like naked body scanners.
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:11.440]  They don't care if you don't like home inspections.
[01:43:11.440 --> 01:43:14.440]  They don't care. They are clearly authoritarians.
[01:43:14.440 --> 01:43:19.440]  And more and more, I see newscast all over the place where they imply
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.440]  that you better stop criticizing the government.
[01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:26.440]  You're going to cause violence. You're going to cause violence.
[01:43:26.440 --> 01:43:31.440]  And so they're selling this message of free speech causes violence.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:34.440]  Therefore, we've got to ban free speech.
[01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:38.440]  Yeah. I mean, we could get very depressed about this, couldn't we, Alice?
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:44.440]  We could all start predicting that global tyranny is definitely going to come tomorrow.
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:48.440]  I think we have to hold out a glimmer of hope. You look at Australia.
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:56.440]  Australia is the liberal party is probably about to defeat the Labour Party over there in the coming elections,
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:44:01.440]  which means that a Conservative administration which doesn't believe in man-made global warming will be there,
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:06.440]  that will give an example to those of us freedom fighters who don't believe in this conspiracy.
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:13.440]  It'll give us a chance to fight back. I'm expecting, I'm relying indeed on you Americans to overthrow Obama.
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:16.440]  If you don't get rid of him, then I'm going to be very disappointed in you.
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:19.440]  Unfortunately, there's nothing we can do in Europe. We are a socialist.
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:22.440]  Well, listen, I agree with you, but I mean, take Cameron, your new prime minister.
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:28.440]  I mean, I saw him a few months ago saying Brown wasn't doing enough on climate change.
[01:44:28.440 --> 01:44:36.440]  Yep, yep. It's hard for your listeners to believe, but we have a... Excuse me.
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:44.440]  We have a Conservative prime minister, a Conservative who believes in global warming even more passionately
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:47.440]  than the socialist administration. He's just booted out.
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:50.440]  He announced his plans. The first thing he did when he became prime minister,
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:54.440]  he announced that he wants Britain to become the greenest economy in the world.
[01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:59.440]  Well, you and I know that the greenest economy means the worst economy
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:04.440]  because a green economy is no kind of economy at all because it's based on alternative energy.
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:08.440]  And alternative energy is an alternative to energy. I know energy at all.
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:12.440]  It doesn't work. It's too expensive. The only way you can make it work is by fleecing the tax...
[01:45:12.440 --> 01:45:18.440]  He knows full well that Queenie and Prince Philip and Charles are all big supporters of this
[01:45:18.440 --> 01:45:24.440]  and they're going to turn the people of England, the people of the UK back into actual feudal serfs.
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:30.440]  That's all this is. I mean, I read the UN documents where they admit they want to go back to a feudal system
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:33.440]  because that's better for the earth and isn't the global depression good.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:36.440]  That means we'll have a lower carbon footprint.
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.440]  Actually, I'll take something very interesting, Alex.
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:44.440]  Everyone thinks that the Duke of Edinburgh, the Queen's husband, is a great believer in global warming.
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:48.440]  I can tell you for a fact that he doesn't believe it.
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:57.440]  In fact, the Duke of Edinburgh asked for a leading climate skeptic to give a talk at one of the Britain's institutions.
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:08.440]  And the invitation was rejected, not by the Duke of Edinburgh, but by the left wingers on the organisation.
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:12.440]  Prince Charles is totally on the wrong side.
[01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:16.440]  He's very much. He's a great believer in man bear pig.
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:20.440]  He says rubbish like, we have 100 months left to save the world.
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:26.440]  But his dad, actually, on this particular issue, is sound, as we would say.
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:32.440]  Well, I have noticed that Prince Philip, and I disagree with most of his views on population reduction and the rest of it,
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:41.440]  I have seen him criticise nanotech and genetic engineering because if you want to talk about something that could potentially get out of control,
[01:46:41.440 --> 01:46:44.440]  it is these cross species crops.
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:50.440]  But you don't hear 99% of these environmental groups with any concern about that, something that could have a potential.
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.440]  So I do have to agree with Prince Philip on that front as well.
[01:46:52.440 --> 01:46:57.440]  Let's take a few calls for James Dillingpole of the...
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:59.440]  Well, writes for a bunch of publications.
[01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:03.440]  I rattle off some of the newspapers you write for in your website.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:05.440]  James.
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:07.440]  I have a blog on the telegraph.
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:09.440]  I write for the spectator.
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:11.440]  I write for human events.
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:12.440]  I write for...
[01:47:12.440 --> 01:47:13.440]  Yeah, I'm a whore.
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.440]  Alex, I write for everyone who'll pay me.
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:17.440]  With the emphasis on pay, please, everyone.
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:19.440]  Well, you've got to get some pay to pay all those taxes.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:21.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to John.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:23.440]  John Colling, you're on the air.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:25.440]  John, where are you calling from?
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:28.440]  I'm calling from Northern Michigan, Alex and James.
[01:47:28.440 --> 01:47:36.440]  I heard a retired Secret Service and a Kansas State trooper who lives up here in Northern Michigan
[01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:43.440]  talked yesterday on a program regarding a colleague out from a sheriff in a rural city down along the coastline.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:48.440]  And this sheriff or chief of police was a former military,
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:53.440]  and he says that regular army has begun to come into their area.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:57.440]  And the concern here with this gentleman, Greg Sevensson,
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:08.440]  is that this oil spill is putting not only going into the water, but the chemical they're using to break it up is very highly toxic.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.440]  Yeah, no, it's worse than the oil itself.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:12.440]  Oil is 100% biodegradable.
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:15.440]  There's regular microbes already in the water that would eat most of it.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:22.440]  They needed to block the estuaries where the fish had their hatcheries, where they breed.
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:28.440]  But the government wouldn't let them build those berms to block it and protect those key fisheries,
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:32.440]  and they're still not letting them, but I don't want to poo-poo what people are saying,
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:35.440]  and I don't know this particular person you're talking about.
[01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:36.440]  No, Alex, Alex.
[01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:37.440]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.440]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:46.440]  I made phone calls two days ago to the places that were in these news articles I saw about all this regular army,
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:50.440]  and I called hotels, and I called gas stations, and I said, are you seeing troops?
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.440]  And they said, no.
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:58.440]  What you do have is you have BP employees who are Boston, and this is on CBS television,
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:05.440]  BP employees telling the Coast Guard what to do at gunpoint, kicking media off the beach.
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:07.440]  So there is a cover-up going on.
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:10.440]  James Dillingpole, your take on that, and I'll go back to John and Michigan.
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.440]  Well, I hadn't heard that, Alex.
[01:49:12.440 --> 01:49:14.440]  That's very interesting.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:21.440]  I still, I don't see Obama being a kind of, in this particular instance,
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.440]  being a kind of sinister man trying to stage a cover-up.
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:33.440]  I see an incompetent man who is terrified of the angry calls he's getting from Louisiana,
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:37.440]  and he's desperate to show himself as a man who's doing something.
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:40.440]  That's why he's talking about kicking butt and things, which is soft-mooring.
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:47.440]  All this nonsense about kicking butt, all this Brit bashing, you know, it's entirely unnecessary,
[01:49:47.440 --> 01:49:52.440]  given that, you know, although there are 40% British shareholders in BP,
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:54.440]  there's also 39% American shareholders.
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:57.440]  No, I mean, that's asinine. It's a total red herring.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:49:59.440]  John, what was the point you were trying to make?
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:04.440]  Well, he stated, and he does have a website later if you let me, I'll give it to you,
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:09.440]  but he talked about the benzene and the natural gas that's coming out of this spill, too,
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:13.440]  that's getting up into the atmosphere to become toxic, and that they're planning that.
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:18.440]  He says they're planning for a possible evacuation for at least 100 miles, and if not 150.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:22.440]  No, no, I've seen those news reports, and I appreciate your call, and we made phone calls.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:25.440]  And, I mean, in fact, I'm going to do this.
[01:50:25.440 --> 01:50:29.440]  We have another guest coming up, but after I go through these calls,
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:38.440]  I'm going to open the phones up only for people in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida.
[01:50:38.440 --> 01:50:42.440]  Are you seeing trips running around getting ready for an evacuation?
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:48.440]  I mean, folks, one oil well, even if it's a half million gallons a day,
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:52.440]  I mean, if Obama tried to evacuate, that's asinine.
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.440]  Evacuate because of some oil?
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:58.440]  Yes, some of the workers are getting lightheaded because they've got the dispersion.
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:00.440]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:04.440]  Here's a question. If you have a septic system, did you know that proper maintenance can save you
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:07.440]  thousands of dollars in costly and unnecessary repairs?
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:12.440]  The answer is simple. Use septic system injector treatments made specifically for your home or business,

[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:01.440]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:07.440]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:12.440]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:15.440]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country,
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:17.440]  and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:22.440]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:30.440]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:34.440]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:38.440]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:43.440]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com,
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:52.440]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365, that's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:57.440]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.440 --> 01:53:00.440]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:34.440]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:19.440]  Music
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:22.440]  He writes for the Telegraph, one of the biggest newspapers in England.
[01:54:22.440 --> 01:54:25.440]  We appreciate James Dillingpole joining us today, great analysis.
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:27.440]  We're continuing with your phone calls.
[01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:31.440]  I've got a privacy expert coming on to deal with Google, Facebook, and others,
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:37.440]  and they're admitted connections to the CIA, and just how they're openly surveilling basically everybody.
[01:54:37.440 --> 01:54:41.440]  Google's little white vans are doing a lot more than taking photos of your house.
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:44.440]  They admittedly are sucking in all the digital transmissions,
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:48.440]  mapping all the wireless networks, and surveilling you.
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:57.440]  That is coming up, and of course, Al Gore is on the board of these organizations, Al Gore is on the board of Apple.
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:54:59.440]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:04.440]  Oh, and we have the iPhone, hundreds or iPad, hundreds of thousands of their customers,
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:09.440]  just had all of their data, all of their names and information released.
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:15.440]  So that's the downside of the digital age, but going back to Mr. Dillingpole and your phone calls.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:18.440]  And again, I'm not poo-pooing troops down there in the Gulf,
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:21.440]  and Obama did say he was sending SWAT teams, which was bizarre.
[01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:28.440]  It's just that I made phone calls, and the people said there are no troops here,
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:31.440]  in the towns where they were supposedly all over the place.
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:33.440]  Now, I've got a CBS News here.
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:42.440]  Troops invade Chicago for training down to planes, rail car crash, and simulated terror attack simulations.
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:45.440]  That's real, but I digress.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:50.440]  Jack in California, you're on the air with Mr. Dillingpole, go ahead.
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.440]  Hey, Jack, how you doing, buddy?
[01:55:52.440 --> 01:55:54.440]  You want to talk on air?
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:56.440]  Okay, he doesn't want to talk on air.
[01:55:56.440 --> 01:56:00.440]  Truth Patriot.
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:06.440]  Okay, who should we go to next then?
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:08.440]  Kathy in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:12.440]  Yes, hi, I've got a question for Mr. Dillingpole.
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:23.440]  I have heard the CEO of BP state publicly on television that BP will be 100% responsible for the cleanup in the Gulf.
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:34.440]  So if this is the case, then why are we hearing that Obama wants to put a tax on us for cleanup in the Gulf, if BP is 100% responsible?
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:39.440]  I'm not sure what's going to happen in this particular case.
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:42.440]  I mean, I would have thought that the BP will pay up.
[01:56:42.440 --> 01:56:54.440]  I think what is absolutely wrong about this is the way that Obama is using this to stoke up anti-British rhetoric and to talk about kicking ass and stuff like that.
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:56:56.440]  It's an absolute nonsense.
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:06.440]  Of course, you know, when a company pollutes, and let's not forget that the actual rig that blew up was not being run directly by BP.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:13.440]  It was being directed by a company called TransOcean, which was actually, and Halliburton was responsible for this.
[01:57:13.440 --> 01:57:16.440]  And by the way, Halliburton is now based in Mumbai.
[01:57:16.440 --> 01:57:29.440]  All these companies are destroying the sovereignty of England, the U.S., and they're just dividing and conquering us, blaming it on Brits when Brits have nothing to do with this, just like Americans have nothing to do with it.
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:37.440]  You know, the Americans have nothing to do with the Federal Reserve, other than the fact we let this private group sit on top of us and abuse us.
[01:57:37.440 --> 01:57:39.440]  It's an asinine diversion.
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:45.440]  It's like MSNBC with their talking point that if you don't want government-run healthcare, you hate black people.
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:49.440]  This is a distraction and a divide and conquer tactic.
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:56.440]  So now it's the Red Codes fault that we've got an oil spill, and now you're a racist if you don't want government-running your healthcare.
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:58:00.440]  He's sounding a lot like Chavez, isn't he, Obama, these days?
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:03.440]  I mean, this is a sort of classic Chavez behavior.
[01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:06.440]  You know, you've got domestic problems, blame somebody else.
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:09.440]  You know, blame abroad, blame capitalism.
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:16.440]  Well, we do it too, they're now saying that, oh, some have been laudans and I ran, James, so we have to attack.
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:22.440]  And maybe, you know, there's a housing project coming through and they want your property and you won't sell James.
[01:58:22.440 --> 01:58:24.440]  They'll just say Al Qaeda's in your house.
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:28.440]  James Dilling-Paul, I appreciate you joining us today, always informative.
[01:58:28.440 --> 01:58:29.440]  Thanks a lot.
[01:58:29.440 --> 01:58:31.440]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:58:31.440 --> 01:58:32.440]  You bet. Thank you.
[01:58:32.440 --> 01:58:34.440]  We're going to come back, take a few more calls.
[01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:40.440]  And then we've got a guest coming on to talk about security issues.
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:46.440]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:50.440]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:50.440 --> 01:58:57.440]  The fall of America and the western world is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[01:58:57.440 --> 01:59:02.440]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:16.440]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Ike, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElvaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:21.440]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:24.440]  The fall of America and the western world.
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:32.440]  And www.thefallofamerica.net or click on the banners at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:41.440]  Again, that website, www.thefallofamerica.net or call 800-655-1577.
[01:59:41.440 --> 01:59:56.440]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today, www.fallofamerica.net.
[02:00:11.440 --> 02:00:23.440]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:28.440]  I'm determined to really open the phones up about the oil spills. People can vent and get your take on it.
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:38.440]  How it's being used is a political distraction. Now, the feds won't let the states fix the problem from day one and there really were ways to mitigate this.
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:46.440]  But why are the states letting the feds tell them they can't? I mean, if I want to brush my teeth, I don't call the White House and say, can I brush my teeth?
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:55.440]  Or if I had a broken pipe in my house, I don't call the feds to get permission to fix the broken pipe. I mean, this is pathetic.
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:01:01.440]  But also, after we've gone through Avon, Jerry, John, Josh, Mike, and others, we got a guest coming up for about 30 minutes.
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:10.440]  But after we've gone through these calls, I'm going to just open the phones up for 30 minutes or so to just get calls from people who are on the Gulf Coast.
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:22.440]  Have you had armed men, police, BP, military in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida tell you you can't be on the beach where oils come in that you can't videotape it?
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:34.440]  Because that's on CBS and ABC footage of men pulling up with guns saying, you can't be on this public beach. Get out of here. Orders of BP. And it's local police or it's Coast Guard.
[02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:41.440]  We've got those articles and videos for now two weeks up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. This is outrageous.
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:49.440]  So I'm not saying it isn't true that troops are deploying and getting ready to evacuate people to 100 miles.
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:57.440]  I mean, they had troops getting ready for total martial law three months before the flu popped up and telling locals it was for flu in January.
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:02:02.440]  And nothing came of it. And now the media admits it was a hoax. I'm not saying this can't go on.
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:07.440]  I mean, hell, they got military checkpoints popping up all over the country, confirmed.
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:14.440]  I just want to confirm it because I saw the names of the towns back a few days ago and it looked credible.
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:20.440]  And I think it's credible for folks to ask the question if they're getting these reports. But I called up some hotels and places in the towns.
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:26.440]  I went on the search engine, looked up maps, looked where they said the troops were and they said, no, there's no troops here.
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:33.440]  We wish there were. We wish they'd let us fix this. Then I'd call the Dairy Queen. I'd call the gas station.
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:40.440]  I mean, look, I get on the telephone, folks. I mean, I do some real work around here. My crew does a great job.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:46.440]  And so we'll open the phones up and I've got listeners in every town along the Gulf Coast.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:52.440]  And if we don't get calls that have seen the troops, then it's a fraud, okay?
[02:02:52.440 --> 02:02:58.440]  Or a false report or maybe there was a training exercise and people got spooked by it. I don't know.
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:03:04.440]  But if it's true and it could be, it could be true. In fact, I had it in my stack.
[02:03:04.440 --> 02:03:08.440]  You guys reprint me because it comes from a good website. I mean, I like some of the stuff they've had.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:13.440]  It's been a bunch of places. Will you reprint me that about troops getting ready to take over Gulf Coast or whatever?
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:16.440]  I already digress. It just gives me a big headache.
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:20.440]  Avon in Florida, you're on the air, Avon.
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:25.440]  Well, sir, it is an honor and pleasure to speak with you. I've been a fan for over seven years.
[02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:29.440]  I first started listening to you as a joke and to laugh at you.
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:36.440]  But the first time I checked into a couple of things you mentioned, I found out you were not even exaggerating a bit.
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.440]  And I've been a fan ever since.
[02:03:38.440 --> 02:03:41.440]  No, I'm not making stuff up. Sometimes I make mistakes.
[02:03:41.440 --> 02:03:47.440]  And it is true. I have a little eccentric and I've probably gone crazy from the stress, but, you know...
[02:03:47.440 --> 02:03:49.440]  I know that feeling, definitely.
[02:03:49.440 --> 02:03:52.440]  Well, I am here in Pinellas County, Florida.
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:57.440]  And just last weekend, I went to a beautiful beach we have out here called Howard Beach.
[02:03:57.440 --> 02:03:59.440]  It's a steak park, in fact.
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:03.440]  A very, very popular place. Very crowded most of the time.
[02:04:03.440 --> 02:04:07.440]  And it was last week. I saw no oil. I was looking for some.
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:11.440]  I needed some for some lubricant, but I figured I might as well get it free if I could.
[02:04:11.440 --> 02:04:17.440]  No troops. I couldn't even find one of the police park guards anywhere.
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:20.440]  And I saw no sign of any problems.
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:25.440]  And you were able to walk. You were able to walk and breathe without government helping you.
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:30.440]  Well, I think they might have been helping me without me knowing it. Thank God for them.
[02:04:30.440 --> 02:04:33.440]  I swam in the water when on my float.
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:36.440]  Well, yeah, that's the issue is I've heard reporters from all over Florida going,
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:39.440]  I'm here looking for the oil. I don't see it. We're not allowed to fish.
[02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:41.440]  They're telling us we can't swim.
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:45.440]  Listen, finish up, Avon. And when we come back, Avon.
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:49.440]  And then Jerry, John, Josh, Mike, we're going to get to you after this guest comes on.
[02:04:49.440 --> 02:04:53.440]  I want to cover first, because we really haven't gone over it enough.
[02:04:53.440 --> 02:04:59.440]  The fact that it's just more and more admitted that Facebook and others are just government fronts.

[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:29.440]  Okay, but the next 30 minutes or so we're honored to be joined by Bill Wagner, authors of A Confession of a Spam King.
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:35.440]  He's been featured on Coast to Coast AM and many other TV stations, C-SPAN, you name it.
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:43.440]  And he is a researcher and considered to be an expert on the internet and billwagner.com's website.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:49.440]  I was going to finish up with that one caller and I got to watch it. I want to apologize to callers.
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:57.440]  Yesterday I went into an hour and 15 minutes of overdrive. I told all the Genesis callers to call my studio phone number.
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:09:05.440]  Then I proceeded to rant in a out of control manner for an hour and 15 minutes, ended the show and forgot I told you to call.
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:15.440]  Just like I just forgotten that I told Avon in Florida to hold because I was going to finish up with him and then was about to forget.
[02:09:15.440 --> 02:09:21.440]  So I think I'm an institute of policy that if I don't go to your calls within 20 minutes when I give the number out,
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:25.440]  we'll just shut the phones down and clear the phones so I don't waste your time and my time.
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:32.440]  And I apologize for that. It's just my brain is all over the map. As I know yours is.
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:39.440]  I mean the world is getting crazy. I'm like a guy in a batting cage with 50 balls every five seconds being shot at me.
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:45.440]  There's no way to hit them all. I guess I've got to decide which ones are the most important to hit and just focus on those.
[02:09:45.440 --> 02:09:54.440]  But Avon was finishing up with the fact that where he's at in Florida, he doesn't see any oil.
[02:09:54.440 --> 02:10:02.440]  And I'm seeing that in the news. So the media is separately hyping it, but then separately saying it's not a big deal.
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:06.440]  And it's just a lot of weird Psyop propaganda going on here.
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:14.440]  But where it is bad in Mississippi and Louisiana, they won't let the people back a month ago when they had a chance to stop a lot of this,
[02:10:14.440 --> 02:10:17.440]  build their own berms to keep it from getting into the estuaries.
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:28.440]  Because no, this can only be a federal operation. And by the way, we have confirmed that a bunch of National Guard are being sent down there.
[02:10:28.440 --> 02:10:30.440]  So Avon, go ahead and finish your point.
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:39.440]  Yes, sir. A couple things now. I just saw on the news a short while ago, a local channel here, they were showing stuff on the local beaches and saying,
[02:10:39.440 --> 02:10:49.440]  look, there's oil in, but if, you know, I'm born and raised in Florida, what they were showing was the usual stuff we get, dead seaweed, little red tide stuff.
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:54.440]  And it was not oil that they were showing with the wide screen shot of the local beach.
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:57.440]  Well, it looked like old tar bowls. They were like, look, we finally found some.
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:01.440]  And it was tar bowls, which are probably 10 years old.
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:10.440]  Yeah. Yeah. Something like that. And I call myself Avon after Avon Park, one of the original FEMA camps where I had the joy of living there.
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:20.440]  It's a FEMA military camp. I was there for eight and a half years where I first started listening to you by a kind of a jury rig radio that I got my hand.
[02:11:20.440 --> 02:11:24.440]  So were you part of the civilian inmate labor camp program?
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:27.440]  No, sir. Well, more or less, I was in prison, sir.
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:32.440]  Yeah. Well, no, it's just, I know that they've openly had FEMA camps run by the army.
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:37.440]  It's called the civilian inmate labor camp program. And it's just hidden in plain view.
[02:11:37.440 --> 02:11:43.440]  Just like our government admits they grow the opium in Afghanistan. Just like the CIA admits they put out fake bin Laden videos now.
[02:11:43.440 --> 02:11:47.440]  And it's just, oh, no big deal. But now the CIA says bin Laden is going to get us.
[02:11:47.440 --> 02:11:54.440]  He's in Iran with Saddam's WMDs. He's in a warehouse sitting on the nukes.
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:56.440]  I appreciate your call, buddy. Good to hear from you.
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:01.440]  All right. Going to Bill Wagner. Confessions of a spam king.
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:04.440]  And, you know, I could go over his bio here, but that would take up all the time we had today.
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:07.440]  Bill, what's the best way to describe yourself?
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:14.440]  A crusade of truth for this country. A crusade of the Constitution. God's family country.
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:24.440]  That's the best way to describe myself, depending what is true and against the people that try to destroy our daily lives every single day on the Internet
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:35.440]  and try to track and hunt us down and read our emails and spy on us and do everything they can to try to destroy our Internet experience and control it.
[02:12:35.440 --> 02:12:43.440]  Yeah, one of my favorite conspiracy theories is that I'm a federal agent and that I'm sitting there selling everybody's name to the government.
[02:12:43.440 --> 02:12:50.440]  Folks, the government built the Internet. They've already got your name. They're already tracking you. You understand that?
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:56.440]  Alex, can I correct something? It's very important. Billwagger.com is not me.
[02:12:56.440 --> 02:13:01.440]  That is somebody, one of these psycho crazies out there.
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:05.440]  Well, I apologize. That's what I was given in the bio. Give us your website.
[02:13:05.440 --> 02:13:11.440]  It's 888freedom.com. That's my own 888freedom.com.
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:16.440]  Because these people are insane that are putting Bill Wagner up. So 888freedom.
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:21.440]  Well, I apologize, buddy. 888freedom.
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:31.440]  Yeah, I tell you, the government does own the Internet. That's the thing that everybody forgets about, that it was started by the military. It's owned by the military.
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:39.440]  But the thing that gets me out, Alex, is what I don't understand and what I'm crusading against is the fact that there's foreign entities out there.
[02:13:39.440 --> 02:13:46.440]  For example, there's one particular company called Spam House.
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:54.440]  They're out of the United Kingdom. And they're the ones that say what goes on in the United States.
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:14:03.440]  They're the ones that tell America online. They're the ones that tell every Internet service provider that's out there what they can say and what they can't say.
[02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:09.440]  It's unbelievable. I've been in with this company for 16 years. They didn't know about blackmail and extort people.
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:18.440]  And if they don't like you, if they don't like me, they'll put us into what they call a blacklist where people can't even come to our site or even reach us.
[02:14:18.440 --> 02:14:19.440]  These people...
[02:14:19.440 --> 02:14:27.440]  Well, that's right. They have these databases that taxpayer money pays for for government buildings, quote, free government Wi-Fi that taxpayers pay for.
[02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:42.440]  Paul Watson's confirmed, one of my British webmasters, that on the big train systems and the train stations in England and Europe, most places it says you're not allowed to go to infowars.com or prismplanet.com because we're in the hate database.
[02:14:42.440 --> 02:14:45.440]  Yes, I'm in the hate database as well, Alex.
[02:14:45.440 --> 02:14:46.440]  You're hateful.
[02:14:46.440 --> 02:14:59.440]  I've been in 16 years in the hate database. They don't like what I have to say. And the reason why is because I won't bow down to these tyrants. I will not sit back with the King of England, Steve Lindford. That's his name from spamhouse.org.
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:11.440]  I will not bow down to these guys. I will not just pay them off for 150 grand and say, oh, leave me alone. No, no, that's not the way America works, in my opinion. And I will not bow down to these people.
[02:15:11.440 --> 02:15:30.440]  No, I won't. And so you have spamhouse at the top. They're the very top of the food chain, all right? Then you have guys like Google. Now, Google, okay, when I spoke in front of the federal government in 2003, I sat right next to the owner of Google, the guy that runs all the software right there.
[02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:42.440]  And I caught up in a slip. I caught up in a slip and it's right on C-Span and I just laughed and I looked at this thing. And he told me, because I asked him, I said, so you're telling me, because I told him some things.
[02:15:42.440 --> 02:15:54.440]  I said, so you're telling me, you make no money whatsoever. No money whatsoever. This is the guy from Google. I caught him on tape and he says, that's right, sir, we make absolutely no money.
[02:15:54.440 --> 02:16:04.440]  And I just laughed and I said, we'll see to believe it. How much is Google worth? $8 billion? Now, we have under them, we have Facebook.
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:08.440]  No, no, Google's worth a lot more than $8 billion. Is it more now? Is it more now?
[02:16:08.440 --> 02:16:17.440]  Oh, it's just some, it's astronomical. I mean, goodness, Google Earth. Come on, you can find it. It's Google, listen.
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:25.440]  Well, that was in Qtel, known, admitted CIA proprietary development company that funded that.
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:38.440]  I would not doubt that one bit. I know that Google, every email that every search that you do on Google is tracked and fed to a database.
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:50.440]  And that database tracks your habits, tracks your habits, what you like, what you don't like. Your emails that are, you know, someone, it doesn't, so we didn't want to use Gmail and America Online, all these things.
[02:16:50.440 --> 02:17:01.440]  They read what you say before you even get the email, before you even get the email. It's more like a racketeering situation where you have a mob.
[02:17:01.440 --> 02:17:11.440]  And at the top, it's Spam House in the UK. Google listens to them. Then you have Facebook, Twitter, and these other guys that operate under them.
[02:17:11.440 --> 02:17:24.440]  And it's basically, hey, you have to get permission to do anything, anything at all. For example, with me, you know, I went to Washington D.C. for one reason, one reason alone to protect the first amendment in the United States.
[02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:34.440]  To say, hey, listen, not everybody out there is a big bad pornographic email marketer, or email spammer, or what you want to call it.
[02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:43.440]  And they labeled me everything you can possibly imagine. It's like I do the you, Alex. And so I did this, and luckily there was a law passed out of it.
[02:17:43.440 --> 02:17:52.440]  And I protected the first amendment then. But now, for some reason, all these companies say, oh, I'd hell with the law. I'd hell with it. Forget it.
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:18:00.440]  And I don't mean anything. So these companies don't obey the law. They're not obeyed by the Constitution. And they just roll right over us.
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:08.440]  And we're mainly looking now at how they're trying to claim, you know, what can and can't be emailed. They're trying to expand that to calling blog spam.
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:21.440]  Now, your views on your own website are spam. They're trying to manipulate reality. But what you've really written about is the fact that Facebook, Google, and others have all these government connections.
[02:18:21.440 --> 02:18:30.440]  And now it's come out, the Facebook founder is bragging, going, look at these stupid idiots. You know, they believe that they get privacy with us.
[02:18:30.440 --> 02:18:42.440]  They believe they can trust us. What a bunch of morons. And Google's been caught all over the world, not just in England, with these vans running around capturing people's digital wireless communications.
[02:18:42.440 --> 02:18:44.440]  They're not just taking photos.
[02:18:44.440 --> 02:18:53.440]  Right. They store all the information that is going on. If you have a cell phone, you have a cell phone with a browser in it or any of that.
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:59.440]  Okay. And they capture that information, put it into a database. They have everything about you. Period. That's it.
[02:18:59.440 --> 02:19:06.440]  Google has been known. They've been banned in numerous countries. Countries are starting to wake up and say, you know what, you know, we heard this story.
[02:19:06.440 --> 02:19:14.440]  What was it about? No, about a month ago, about China banning Google. Well, I don't blame China for banning Google because Google wants to take their secrets.
[02:19:14.440 --> 02:19:24.440]  Everybody else has secrets in their personal lives. And I like my privacy. I like my privacy. And I know how to keep my privacy, and I'm going to keep my privacy.
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:41.440]  And what I do when I write my book is I talk about how people, for example, I tell people who is behind what, what companies do these things, how they do it, how, you know, ways to protect themselves from the big bad, big bad browser on the internet.
[02:19:41.440 --> 02:19:55.440]  All right. Let's talk about Facebook and Google and your research into them. But now, I mean, here's mainstream news about headline. You know, Facebook, Google invented by the CIA.
[02:19:55.440 --> 02:20:02.440]  That's one headline. It just goes on and on. We're going to break it down.
[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:15.440]  This is not a drill. Repeat. This is not a drill. Gun cells are on a staggering pace. Gun prices are going through the roof and that means desperate, vicious criminals now want your guns and will do anything to get them.
[02:20:15.440 --> 02:20:31.440]  Now, a new book reveals powerful secrets for hiding your guns from thieves and looters. You'll learn step by step, battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should never hide your guns under any circumstance.
[02:20:31.440 --> 02:20:39.440]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:48.440]  But listen up. For security reasons, the hide your guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time. Go to hideyourguns.com.
[02:20:48.440 --> 02:21:01.440]  That's hideyourguns.com or call 877-327-0365 before they come for your guns. Hideyourguns.com right now.
[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:08.440]  Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources, one of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms. I get it.
[02:21:08.440 --> 02:21:18.440]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job, that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy, that social security would be there for you.
[02:21:18.440 --> 02:21:27.440]  That's not what's happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation, or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:31.440]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[02:21:31.440 --> 02:21:41.440]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:50.440]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios. You should, too. Find out what they know. Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well, free.
[02:21:50.440 --> 02:22:00.440]  800-686-2237. 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:06.440]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:06.440 --> 02:22:09.440]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:09.440 --> 02:22:13.440]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:17.440]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:17.440 --> 02:22:23.440]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[02:22:23.440 --> 02:22:27.440]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:27.440 --> 02:22:31.440]  Everybody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:32.440]  You have been warned.
[02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:36.440]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law.
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:41.440]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you. Don't tread on me.
[02:22:41.440 --> 02:22:42.440]  Rise the republic.
[02:22:42.440 --> 02:22:47.440]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:22:47.440 --> 02:22:57.440]  A new tool in the InfoWars. Don't tread on me. Order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139

[02:24:00.440 --> 02:24:18.440]  We'll have to have him back up again in the near future because we're almost out of time. Really interesting website and I was familiar with his work, very interesting research.
[02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:33.440]  Give us your website one more time and then in the remaining time we've got go into the ways that Facebook and Google and others are A. government connected and B. just sucking everything up.
[02:24:33.440 --> 02:24:52.440]  Okay, number one on my website, thank you Alex, is 888freedom.com, that's 888freedom.com and through that site you can go to my other site that I don't much, I'm not going to mention, but you go through there and it shows you how to protect yourself from all of these
[02:24:52.440 --> 02:25:02.440]  privacy vampires that are trying to destroy and take everything from you every day. Now, the government owns the internet. Okay, they own the internet, they own it.
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:17.440]  There was a bill passed in 2003 called the Can Spam Act and this law allowed free speech to reign, small business to reign, supposedly, but it doesn't happen that way.
[02:25:17.440 --> 02:25:36.440]  But that's going to Facebook, let's get really down and dirty. Okay, let's put it this way, anybody, anyone, anybody that belongs to Facebook, anybody that belongs to Twitter, anybody that belongs to MySpace, anybody that belongs to Google, anything you upload, anything, anything.
[02:25:36.440 --> 02:25:47.440]  Let's say you upload, for example, a show, Alex, a show of yours, your intellectual property, right? It says in the terms of servers on Twitter, I can't read it verbatim, but I'm going to tell you.
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:58.440]  They say they own it, yes. Yes, they say anything, like pictures of my kids, for example, I didn't know this, I had to start investigating these guys a really big time because they own everything.
[02:25:58.440 --> 02:26:09.440]  No, no, that's why suddenly Fox News, CNN and others are showing YouTube videos because it puts your copyright into a no man's land, which I'm happy because I just want to get the word out.
[02:26:09.440 --> 02:26:16.440]  But no, I read that years ago when I first started uploading five, six years ago to YouTube, they say, hey, we own your stuff now.
[02:26:16.440 --> 02:26:29.440]  Yeah, but the thing is nobody, how many people know, and that's the problem, it's nobody knows. And for example, everybody thinks an email is a spam email, but let me clarify what spam is.
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:37.440]  Spam is illegal activity when someone steals your computer to send out their garbage about pornography, and that is what spam is.
[02:26:37.440 --> 02:26:46.440]  Sending an email to your friend or getting your newsletter out is just freedom of speech and getting things out to the public so they know, but they want to shut it down.
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:56.440]  Google reads everything, so if you put a word in there, okay, let's say you send an email to a friend, you're saying it from Google or to Google, and a word that they don't like.
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:00.440]  Let's say FEMA camps, or let's say whatever you want to call it.
[02:27:00.440 --> 02:27:09.440]  No, we've noticed we can't get articles out with the name Bill Gates in it. They delist that automatically. Look at BP, how they just got caught buying the search terms.
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:14.440]  And a little guy like me, Bill Wagoner, I can't even send an email to certain places like Microsoft.
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:30.440]  Well, I got home from DC in 2003, late 2003. I, that name Wagoner, couldn't, they refused to allow Wagoner to even come as a normal personal email to a friend.
[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:40.440]  So all of these places that are free, all of them, you know, Earthlink, Hotmail, Google, Microsoft Live, Yahoo.
[02:27:40.440 --> 02:27:46.440]  Let me tell you a real horror story here real quick, because it's in here. I had a friend of mine, okay, we know about Google Earth.
[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:50.440]  We know it's all control. We know that you can find anything you want to find out, right?
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:55.440]  But now, they have this little plug-in on Yahoo. And a friend of mine called me and said, Bill, you're not going to believe this.
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:28:00.440]  I said, what? He said, I opened my Yahoo box. A friend sent me an email.
[02:28:00.440 --> 02:28:10.440]  It showed his email. It showed where he lived, directions to get to his house, the whole nine yards. Without him even asking for this, he didn't download Google Earth, nothing.
[02:28:10.440 --> 02:28:17.440]  And it's just coming up. So, terrorists, anybody can find out where you live right now. That's it. Twitter.
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:23.440]  Well, it's the same thing. What movie you're going to see, they now know.
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:31.440]  Where you're going on vacation, they know. And it's all being watched. And from all the CIA people I've had on, like Mr. Steele and others,
[02:28:31.440 --> 02:28:41.440]  Google and Facebook were created by the CIA, by the Pentagon, and they're not just infiltrated. They are government.
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:47.440]  Oh, yeah. And you have to look at the top, though. You have to look at the top. Alex, you really do.
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:55.440]  Well, look what Schmidt, they had a Google said last month on MSNBC. He said, look, you shouldn't be doing anything you're ashamed of on the Internet.
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:28:56.440]  You have no privacy.
[02:28:56.440 --> 02:29:06.440]  Yep, privacy is dead. There's so many stories about these Internet top dogs that were there.
[02:29:06.440 --> 02:29:12.440]  And say these things, that your privacy is dead, and if you're not doing anything wrong, you've got nothing to worry about.
[02:29:12.440 --> 02:29:16.440]  But then they always make themselves exempt from their own technology.
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:24.440]  Exactly. They go, oh, well, it doesn't apply to us. It doesn't apply to us. Well, guess what? It does apply to you guys.
[02:29:24.440 --> 02:29:31.440]  And you know what? When the bottom line comes down, the people know, which are spreading the word everywhere.
[02:29:31.440 --> 02:29:38.440]  Well, Bill, stay there. I'm going to do a few more minutes with you on the side, and particularly ask you where this is going.
[02:29:38.440 --> 02:29:46.440]  Because, you know, don't be evil. I mean, that was the NSA sick joke about their NSA operation known as Google.
[02:29:46.440 --> 02:29:50.440]  Now people know they are evil, not just evil, pure evil.
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:30:00.440]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.440 --> 02:30:05.440]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:30:05.440 --> 02:30:12.440]  What have we got? A republic or a monarchy? A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:30:12.440 --> 02:30:16.440]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:30:16.440 --> 02:30:22.440]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education, our money.
[02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:26.440]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:30:26.440 --> 02:30:30.440]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot uprising.
[02:30:30.440 --> 02:30:35.440]  We have the facts, we have the constitution, we have the Bill of Rights, we have common law.
[02:30:35.440 --> 02:30:40.440]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me,
[02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:46.440]  Rise of the Republic, tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:56.440]  A new tool in the Info War, Don't Tread on Me, order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139
[02:30:56.440 --> 02:30:59.440]  and support independent, patriotic, liberty films.
[02:30:59.440 --> 02:31:04.440]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:08.440]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:08.440 --> 02:31:14.440]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:14.440 --> 02:31:20.440]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.440 --> 02:31:24.440]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:29.440]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.440 --> 02:31:32.440]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.440 --> 02:31:36.440]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:41.440]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.440 --> 02:31:46.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[02:31:46.440 --> 02:31:50.440]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:50.440 --> 02:31:52.440]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:31:59.440 --> 02:32:07.440]  The fall of America and the western world is an all-new ten-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[02:32:07.440 --> 02:32:12.440]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.

[02:33:03.440 --> 02:33:07.440]  What Bill Wagner is exposing is so important.
[02:33:07.440 --> 02:33:13.440]  There are open announcements that they want a kindler, gentler internet with taxes on alternative speech,
[02:33:13.440 --> 02:33:21.440]  with government watchdog agencies that superimpose through the browser on the computer,
[02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:27.440]  government counter-messages to quote, bring balance.
[02:33:27.440 --> 02:33:35.440]  We're talking about the end of free speech and in public schools, in colleges, in corporations,
[02:33:35.440 --> 02:33:39.440]  infowars.com and prismplanet.com is blocked.
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:42.440]  And it's one thing if a private corporation does it, that's their right.
[02:33:42.440 --> 02:33:47.440]  But then they slander me, they defame me by saying I'm teaching hatred.
[02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:52.440]  And they say in some of the databases we've gotten screenshots of, hacking.
[02:33:52.440 --> 02:33:55.440]  There's nothing or criminal activity.
[02:33:55.440 --> 02:33:59.440]  That's one of the new ones I'm seeing in these databases.
[02:33:59.440 --> 02:34:02.440]  And now the FCC is announcing they control the internet.
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:05.440]  They're going to regulate it. The FTC is announcing it.
[02:34:05.440 --> 02:34:14.440]  And they're saying openly that, oh, we're going to take your tax money and then provide you 3 and 4G nationwide.
[02:34:14.440 --> 02:34:24.440]  So the government not only runs General Motors and a lot of the big oil companies and has control over the banks now.
[02:34:24.440 --> 02:34:30.440]  In this merger of corporations and government, this inside crony capitalism that we have, this fraud.
[02:34:30.440 --> 02:34:32.440]  It's not free market.
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:41.440]  Now they're going to take your tax money and compete with the other 3 and 4G networks or do contracts they're saying with government to,
[02:34:41.440 --> 02:34:49.440]  where the government gives contracts to run the, quote, public networks through AT&T, Verizon, Sprint and others.
[02:34:49.440 --> 02:34:56.440]  And then our sites will be blocked from those as part of the filter protection.
[02:34:56.440 --> 02:35:01.440]  So this is what internet 2 really is. Going back to Mr. Wagner from your research,
[02:35:01.440 --> 02:35:06.440]  what are some other ways they're planning with this cocktail of moves?
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:10.440]  How do you see them implementing all these announcements with cybersecurity?
[02:35:10.440 --> 02:35:14.440]  Obama's saying, I may have to shut the web off to protect it.
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:16.440]  I mean, they're really coming out in the open.
[02:35:16.440 --> 02:35:20.440]  And how far away do you think they are from really starting to drop the hammer on us?
[02:35:20.440 --> 02:35:27.440]  Well, I think this, I think there is no way they could ever drop the hammer on all of us because the internet,
[02:35:27.440 --> 02:35:34.440]  what they would do is if they did that, let's say Mr. Obama, that's what I'll call him, Mr. Obama,
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:39.440]  is that he said, I've heard him say it, yeah, might have to turn the internet off.
[02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:42.440]  Well, let me tell you what would happen if that was the case.
[02:35:42.440 --> 02:35:46.440]  It would create more hackers than he could ever imagine.
[02:35:46.440 --> 02:35:48.440]  Right now we have hacker problems as it is.
[02:35:48.440 --> 02:35:53.440]  Now, if he said to shut the internet off and say it's going to be all government controlled,
[02:35:53.440 --> 02:36:00.440]  everything we say, the FCC, FTC, blah, blah, all this, there would be hackers everywhere.
[02:36:00.440 --> 02:36:07.440]  Do you think that people, I mean, I don't think people, I know that people always prevail, at least in my opinion.
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:14.440]  You know, I've learned things in my life, in my 16 years of doing this, of how to beat these people.
[02:36:14.440 --> 02:36:19.440]  Okay, I see going this way. I see Facebook dying saying bye-bye.
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:23.440]  The more we talk about this, the more they're going to go away.
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:27.440]  I see these companies like Google, the more we talk about this, them going away.
[02:36:27.440 --> 02:36:35.440]  But there's one company that we have to, if we get this one company, this one organization off our backs
[02:36:35.440 --> 02:36:47.440]  and hold them accountable called Spam House, you have to look it up, Alex, this is so important, SPAMHUS.org.
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:53.440]  Once we shut these guys down, then everything is possible.
[02:36:53.440 --> 02:37:03.440]  Well, isn't that just a writing service that is creating some of the databases that are creating the databases of what they say is spam?
[02:37:03.440 --> 02:37:07.440]  That's what they claim, but no, no, no.
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:11.440]  They're the ones that tell these providers what to do.
[02:37:11.440 --> 02:37:13.440]  They're the ones that read your email.
[02:37:13.440 --> 02:37:19.440]  They're the ones that tell these companies, like I said, they're the ones that tell Google what to do.
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:25.440]  I don't know how these people in Britain get this power, but they are the ones.
[02:37:25.440 --> 02:37:33.440]  When I first started off my internet career, these people immediately attacked me.
[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:36.440]  Immediately, I'll get death threats every single day.
[02:37:36.440 --> 02:37:38.440]  They're attacking me to this day.
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:40.440]  Well, I have to be honest with you.
[02:37:40.440 --> 02:37:43.440]  I mean, there's everything about Facebook and Google I have articles about.
[02:37:43.440 --> 02:37:50.440]  But I don't know enough about this organization to be able to say that they're the ones sending you death threats.
[02:37:50.440 --> 02:37:56.440]  Well, Alex, let me tell you, it's very hard to find out unless you've been there, you know what I'm saying?
[02:37:56.440 --> 02:37:59.440]  No, no, hey, listen, I've definitely got to read your book.
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:00.440]  Does your book cover all this?
[02:38:00.440 --> 02:38:02.440]  Yes, it does, in detail.
[02:38:02.440 --> 02:38:03.440]  Well, listen, do this.
[02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:06.440]  I appreciate you coming on with us and I appreciate you being on the show.
[02:38:06.440 --> 02:38:08.440]  I appreciate you bringing me on the show, man.
[02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:09.440]  You bet.
[02:38:09.440 --> 02:38:19.440]  I'm going to get your address and we're going to give you our address right now and off air and send me your book because I want to read that and investigate that for myself
[02:38:19.440 --> 02:38:21.440]  because I know about Google.
[02:38:21.440 --> 02:38:22.440]  I know about Facebook.
[02:38:22.440 --> 02:38:24.440]  I know about these other organizations.
[02:38:24.440 --> 02:38:28.440]  I don't know about the group that you're speaking about.
[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:33.440]  And so I don't really like to get into things that I haven't personally researched.
[02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:38.440]  And then and then we have guest on who who expand on things, but that's that's very interesting.
[02:38:38.440 --> 02:38:47.440]  I'm sorry that that you say that organization has been out to get you some other news that I wanted to hit on here.
[02:38:47.440 --> 02:39:00.440]  And a lot of this is up on GCN live dot com is publisher slaps outdated warning on US Constitution founding documents.
[02:39:00.440 --> 02:39:11.440]  This article is also up on prison planet dot com warns parents that declaration of independence should be contextualized for kids.
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:16.440]  And it goes on to basically say it's an outdated old document.
[02:39:16.440 --> 02:39:17.440]  Here's a quote.
[02:39:17.440 --> 02:39:26.440]  This book is a product of a time of its time and does not reflect the same values as it would if it were written today.
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:30.440]  They also provide advice to parents seeking to educate their children on US history.
[02:39:30.440 --> 02:39:41.440]  Parents might wish to discuss with their children how views on race, gender, sexuality, ethnicity and interpersonal relationships have changed since this book was written before allowing them to read the classic work.
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:50.440]  And so they put out a copy of the Constitution and God forbid somebody just read the Constitution for themselves.
[02:39:50.440 --> 02:39:53.440]  No, they've got to put an advisory on it.
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:40:01.440]  Like you know parental discretion is advised before an R rated or NC 17 movie comes on.
[02:40:01.440 --> 02:40:08.440]  We first reported on this about a month ago but Fox News has picked it up now so that articles up on GCN live dot com.
[02:40:08.440 --> 02:40:18.440]  And continuing angry progressives shut down Madame Pelosi for not delivering stolen goods.
[02:40:18.440 --> 02:40:23.440]  And it says even the foundation sponsored socialists are mad at the government.
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:37.440]  On Tuesday, a few of them gave Madame Pelosi a piece of their mind during an American Future Now conference sponsored by Campaign for America Future, a branch of the Democratic Party.
[02:40:37.440 --> 02:40:39.440]  And they want their free healthcare.
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:42.440]  Well, I'm sorry you didn't read the bill.
[02:40:42.440 --> 02:40:44.440]  The insurance companies wrote it.
[02:40:44.440 --> 02:40:50.440]  It cuts Medicare and Medicaid by $40 plus billion a piece, so 80 plus billion a year to start with.
[02:40:50.440 --> 02:40:55.440]  It allows insurance companies to lower the standard of care with comparative cares, the buzzword.
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:41:04.440]  It does create the federal panels that set policy through computer directives to dentists, doctors, you name it.
[02:41:04.440 --> 02:41:15.440]  It just decimates everything and doesn't give coverage to children and people with preexisting conditions.
[02:41:15.440 --> 02:41:19.440]  So yeah, you get free healthcare in Cuba.
[02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:21.440]  You get a bad knee.
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:23.440]  They give you a cane.
[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:25.440]  You get bad eyesight.
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:28.440]  They give you a walking stick.
[02:41:28.440 --> 02:41:32.440]  Maybe you get a shot of steroids in the back if you got a bad back.
[02:41:32.440 --> 02:41:43.440]  I mean, okay, so Code Pink harangue Pelosi and demand Democrats make it on the promise to steal from the producers and give to the constituency.
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:48.440]  And again, these are kind of like a fungus that the new order releases of well-meaning socialists.
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:52.440]  I mean, they really believe what they're selling.
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:56.440]  And they basically sprinkle it like you put something on a crop to kill it.
[02:41:56.440 --> 02:41:58.440]  You know, the CIA has been caught doing that.
[02:41:58.440 --> 02:41:59.440]  They just sprinkle them out there.
[02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:01.440]  They produce big government.
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:04.440]  They put the debt to the bankers and then we're bankrupt.
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:06.440]  And we're all dependent on government.
[02:42:06.440 --> 02:42:10.440]  And then we all basically live in squalor cities with sewage running down the middle of the street.
[02:42:10.440 --> 02:42:13.440]  And in areas of America now look like that.
[02:42:13.440 --> 02:42:16.440]  Many areas of Florida and California and Texas.
[02:42:16.440 --> 02:42:25.440]  And soon there'll be sewage everywhere except for armored compounds up on the hill where the tiny local wealthy people live who serve the elite.
[02:42:25.440 --> 02:42:28.440]  And so you want sewage and chickens run around the street.
[02:42:28.440 --> 02:42:29.440]  You get it.
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:32.440]  People take over sewage and chickens running around the street.
[02:42:32.440 --> 02:42:36.440]  So land of the sewage, home of the chickens, it goes on.
[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:44.440]  It should be obvious by now even to the far old Democrats that the federal government has no intention of implementing their socialist fairytale paradise.
[02:42:44.440 --> 02:42:49.440]  No, no, they're going to raise the taxes, keep the money for the bankers and then cut your health care.
[02:42:49.440 --> 02:42:54.440]  So they're now protesting that as that dawns on them.
[02:42:54.440 --> 02:42:59.440]  And those of you saying that, you know, they're not going to get away with trying to shut the web down.
[02:42:59.440 --> 02:43:03.440]  You said they weren't going to get away with hijacking health care.
[02:43:03.440 --> 02:43:14.440]  By the way, I have people working in my office who have been pulled over without a current driver's license.
[02:43:14.440 --> 02:43:17.440]  I've had one for six months, not current.
[02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:18.440]  It finally came in the mail.
[02:43:18.440 --> 02:43:19.440]  I renewed six months ago.
[02:43:19.440 --> 02:43:20.440]  It never came.
[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:22.440]  Six months later, it came for six months.
[02:43:22.440 --> 02:43:23.440]  I haven't had one.
[02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:27.440]  If I got pulled over, there's a good chance the cops would arrest me.
[02:43:27.440 --> 02:43:32.440]  But illegal aliens, and I've had the Austin cops tell me, you know, they're told, don't arrest them for no ID.
[02:43:32.440 --> 02:43:33.440]  Okay.
[02:43:33.440 --> 02:43:45.440]  So, so, so just remember that when I point out that this is all a double standard.
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:48.440]  And it's the same thing across the board.
[02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:59.440]  The government is lawless and I brought that story up to make another point and then I forget the original point I was about to make.
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:09.440]  I've got a bunch of videos posted today on prisonplanet.com pro Obama thug viciously attacks anti bailout protester.
[02:44:09.440 --> 02:44:10.440]  Got that.
[02:44:10.440 --> 02:44:12.440]  But you won't see Chris Matthews running a report about that.
[02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:13.440]  No, he's running a report.
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:23.440]  We have the script next Wednesday where it implies says Alex isn't going to go out and kill cops, but his supporters sure are.
[02:44:23.440 --> 02:44:26.440]  I mean, what on earth is this?
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:28.440]  The show is not about killing cops.
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:31.440]  Neither is I don't want government run healthcare.
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:32.440]  Oh, you're a clan member.
[02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:33.440]  What does that have to do with it?
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:35.440]  I don't want the government run healthcare.
[02:44:35.440 --> 02:44:36.440]  They'll screw it up.
[02:44:36.440 --> 02:44:38.440]  It's a scam for special interest.
[02:44:38.440 --> 02:44:44.440]  Oh, really racist. Tell us about the last area nations meeting you were at.
[02:44:44.440 --> 02:44:47.440]  Hey, I don't want government run healthcare.
[02:44:47.440 --> 02:44:48.440]  Okay, I'll just shut up.
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:49.440]  Don't call me racist.
[02:44:49.440 --> 02:44:50.440]  Okay, fine.
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:52.440]  Take my money.
[02:44:52.440 --> 02:44:57.440]  It doesn't work anymore, folks.
[02:44:57.440 --> 02:45:02.440]  There's a Mike Adams report up on GCN live.com new research.
[02:45:02.440 --> 02:45:05.440]  Electro pollution can cause diabetes.
[02:45:05.440 --> 02:45:08.440]  Of course, a bunch of other studies have shown this for a while.
[02:45:08.440 --> 02:45:11.440]  Most people are familiar with type one diabetes and type two diabetes.
[02:45:11.440 --> 02:45:27.440]  But did you know that researchers have discovered a third type of diabetes type three diabetes as they're calling it affects people who are extra sensitive to electrical devices that emit dirty electricity type three diabetes actually experienced spikes in blood sugar and increased heart rate when exposed to electric pollution.
[02:45:27.440 --> 02:45:34.440]  I saw research 10 years ago about cell phones actually heat the brain from things like computers, televisions, cordless mobile phones.
[02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:36.440]  Even compact fluorescent light bulbs.
[02:45:36.440 --> 02:45:38.440]  Notice all the report people getting sick from those.
[02:45:38.440 --> 02:45:40.440]  The government says it's the law.
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:42.440]  You must have them.
[02:45:42.440 --> 02:45:55.440]  Dr. Magda Havas, PhD from Trent University in Canada recently published the results of a study she conducted on the relationship between electromagnetic fields and diabetes and electromagnetic biology and medicine paper.
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:46:03.440]  In it, she explains how she and her team, I want to get her on by the way, came to discover how this about why electro pollution is so dangerous.
[02:46:03.440 --> 02:46:08.440]  For so many people.
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:14.440]  And again, I was seven, eight years old and noticed that when I would brush my teeth, I'd get a headache and want to go lay on the couch.
[02:46:14.440 --> 02:46:18.440]  Nobody told me sodium fluoride was deadly poison, especially for children.
[02:46:18.440 --> 02:46:25.440]  Or that it causes an excitotoxin effect where other toxins and drugs and things are accentuated in the body.
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:28.440]  I just knew, man, this stuff makes me feel sick.
[02:46:28.440 --> 02:46:34.440]  Fluoride treatments, when I get them once a year, I would have to get nauseous and lay in the back of the car driving home.
[02:46:34.440 --> 02:46:36.440]  I get a headache just thinking about it.
[02:46:36.440 --> 02:46:42.440]  And everybody's like, God, these, you know, I want phosphorescent bulbs, but they're shutting down the manufacturer.
[02:46:42.440 --> 02:46:46.440]  You know, they put in fluorescence, they put in these new compact fluorescence.
[02:46:46.440 --> 02:46:50.440]  Man, do I get a headache around them?
[02:46:50.440 --> 02:46:56.440]  Well, of course you do.
[02:46:56.440 --> 02:47:05.440]  I mean, when you put an AM radio near a fluorescent bulb, it buzzes.
[02:47:05.440 --> 02:47:14.440]  It's ejecting so much electromagnetic radiation that it's causing AM radios to not pick it up.
[02:47:14.440 --> 02:47:19.440]  We ought to do an experiment in here, put it on, say, AM 590, which we're on here in Austin.
[02:47:19.440 --> 02:47:21.440]  And, you know, have the show on here.
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:23.440]  Well, I guess we couldn't play the show.
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:26.440]  Play somebody else's show because they do a feedback loop.
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:34.440]  And just take a fluorescent light bulb and bring it over next to the antenna when we're listening to AM.
[02:47:34.440 --> 02:47:36.440]  The show's coming in clear.
[02:47:36.440 --> 02:47:40.440]  Bring the light bulb over.
[02:47:40.440 --> 02:47:45.440]  When you're listening to AM radio and you pull underneath power lines, you notice how it cuts out?
[02:47:45.440 --> 02:47:48.440]  Because they're broadcasting their own radiation.
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:50.440]  They're broadcasting their own wavelength.
[02:47:50.440 --> 02:47:52.440]  I mean, they knew this in World War II.
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:59.440]  Guys who would sit in front of a radar dish sometimes would die a week later from it.
[02:47:59.440 --> 02:48:07.440]  They would put their food in front of radar and heat up a roast in front of a radar.
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:14.440]  I mean, anybody in radio knows you don't get near an AM or FM big transmitter that it can burn you in the tower.
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:16.440]  You don't get near it when it's on.
[02:48:16.440 --> 02:48:20.440]  It's blasting radiation.
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:25.440]  Not the same as what comes off a uranium or plutonium bomb, but still damaging you.
[02:48:25.440 --> 02:48:32.440]  I mean, your eyes can only see a very narrow bandwidth of the full spectrum.
[02:48:32.440 --> 02:48:38.440]  You can't see what's blasting out, what's going on.
[02:48:38.440 --> 02:48:39.440]  Very interesting information.
[02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:43.440]  Again, this is up on infowars.com as well as GCNLive.com.
[02:48:43.440 --> 02:48:52.440]  And it's, of course, from natural news and the health ranger, Dr. Magda Havas, a PhD from Trent University in Canada,
[02:48:52.440 --> 02:49:00.440]  recently published the results of a study she conducted on the relationship between electromagnetic fields and diabetes and electromagnetic biology and medicine.
[02:49:00.440 --> 02:49:08.440]  It is, she explains, how she and her team came to discover this about why electropollution is so dangerous for many people.
[02:49:08.440 --> 02:49:10.440]  Blood sugar goes haywire.
[02:49:10.440 --> 02:49:14.440]  See, it's bouncing off the cells, it's causing them to resonate.
[02:49:14.440 --> 02:49:21.440]  One of the most interesting findings in her study was that electrosensitive people whose blood sugar decreases when they go for a walk outdoors
[02:49:21.440 --> 02:49:26.440]  actually experience an increase in blood sugar when walking on a treadmill.
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:32.440]  Treadmills, you see, are electromagnetic devices that emit electrical pollution.
[02:49:32.440 --> 02:49:42.440]  But interestingly, because it's spinning, even the physical exertion of walking on the treadmill did not make up for the blood sugar spiking effect of the EMF submitted by treadmills.
[02:49:42.440 --> 02:49:50.440]  Despite the experience, in other words, type 3 diabetics experience significant spikes in blood sugar when walking on the treadmill.
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:52.440]  I mean, this is scientific.
[02:49:52.440 --> 02:49:57.440]  They're hooking them up to treadmills and the electromagnetic radiation is making their blood sugar spike.
[02:49:57.440 --> 02:50:01.440]  It's not being absorbed by the exertion.
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:10.440]  Dirty electrical systems, dirty electricity is bad for anyone, but it's especially bad for people who are type 3 diabetics.
[02:50:10.440 --> 02:50:18.440]  And Dr. Havas explains in her study that even having an electrical device plugged in the wall near someone who is type 3 diabetic can cause them problems.
[02:50:18.440 --> 02:50:27.440]  People that finally get off all the GMO, people who are dying, having liver failure, get off GMO, get off all this stuff, suddenly their problems are over.
[02:50:27.440 --> 02:50:28.440]  They're solved.
[02:50:28.440 --> 02:50:35.440]  I mean, I am in here with all these fluorescent lights aimed at me, because we don't use the hot lights that can burn things down.
[02:50:35.440 --> 02:50:38.440]  I've got electromagnetic systems all around me.
[02:50:38.440 --> 02:50:42.440]  I mean, I'm just bathed in a jacket of it.
[02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:49.440]  Why do you think when you're out in the country, far away from power lines, far away from everything, you just feel so peaceful?
[02:50:49.440 --> 02:50:53.440]  Because you're not in the electromagnetic pollution.
[02:50:53.440 --> 02:50:58.440]  I'm going to come back, get to a few of your calls, and got another guest coming up.
[02:50:58.440 --> 02:51:26.440]  Yeah.

[02:52:00.440 --> 02:52:03.440]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:52:03.440 --> 02:52:05.440]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:52:05.440 --> 02:52:08.440]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.440 --> 02:52:13.440]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:13.440 --> 02:52:18.440]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.440 --> 02:52:20.440]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:26.440]  The United Nations would take over America. The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:26.440 --> 02:52:34.440]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.440 --> 02:52:39.440]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:39.440 --> 02:52:42.440]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.440 --> 02:52:48.440]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[02:53:01.440 --> 02:53:02.440]  The Problem
[02:53:02.440 --> 02:53:04.440]  How do I cook food without power?
[02:53:04.440 --> 02:53:07.440]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[02:53:07.440 --> 02:53:10.440]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[02:53:10.440 --> 02:53:12.440]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[02:53:12.440 --> 02:53:21.440]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from Kero Stove.

[02:54:22.440 --> 02:54:32.440]  Okay, here's the deal. I got Lindsay Williams on in the next hour about the oil spill, and of course he worked for oil companies for many years as inside sources that have proven to be extremely accurate.
[02:54:32.440 --> 02:54:41.440]  And so he'll be joining us to give us his take on that. He says he has exclusive information that he's breaking here on this radio broadcast.
[02:54:41.440 --> 02:54:53.440]  During that hour, I'm going to have open phones on the oil spill and the oil spill only because people want to talk about this, and I think it's important to discuss on so many different angles.
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:55:17.440]  But specifically, the phones are open for people who have seen military on the Gulf Coast because it is true, and it is documented that tens of thousands of National Guard have been dispatched finally, 40-something days into this, to help out with what's going on down there.
[02:55:17.440 --> 02:55:35.440]  But I've gotten separate reports that are unconfirmed that they're preparing an evacuation of the area and that FEMA's going to take control of the entire Gulf Coast region from the eastern Texas Coast area all the way around Florida and up the east coast.
[02:55:35.440 --> 02:55:48.440]  Because the oil's going to go over, around Florida, and up the east coast. I mean, they know how those currents flow, and it's already going that direction, just as the satellites models predicted months ago or several weeks ago.
[02:55:48.440 --> 02:56:05.440]  Now, FEMA did lock down New Orleans and didn't bring food and water. For five days, people in the Superdome and wouldn't let people walk out over the highways and ordered cops to gun them down, and then the cops followed orders and went to prison for it.
[02:56:05.440 --> 02:56:19.440]  Remember, that was a conspiracy theory the first few months. There were not police shooting innocent people trying to leave. Well, now those cops are in prison under FEMA orders. I'm not saying it was good what they did, but who's worse, those that follow the orders or those that gave the orders?
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:31.440]  Well, historically, those that give the orders are even more guilty than those that carry them out. It's like Bush saying last week on television, I would order waterboarding and torture again.
[02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:46.440]  Okay, well, you ordered people in Afghanistan and Iraq to torture. When they got caught, a bunch of them went to prison. They tried to bring it up in court that they were ordered to, but the Patriot Act was declared to block that from being in court.
[02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:59.440]  So we better let them out of prison real fast. You know, if George W. can run around saying he'd do it all over again, this needs to be heard by a court.
[02:56:59.440 --> 02:57:12.440]  Or we need to release these people that did the torture right now because you can't have Bush running around free while the people that followed orders are in prison. I mean, folks, this is all common sense logic.
[02:57:12.440 --> 02:57:20.440]  And it really makes my head hurt. Some days I love doing the show. Some days I get frustrated and angry. And some days I get so frustrated and angry, I can't even think straight.
[02:57:20.440 --> 02:57:32.440]  I mean, oh, it is really making my head hurt. I mean, physically making my head hurt.
[02:57:32.440 --> 02:57:43.440]  Well, here it is. Pentagon OK is up to 17,500 guardsmen for Gulf oil spill cleanup. And some of the first units are just now arriving.
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:56.440]  6,000 for Louisiana, 3,000 Alabama, 2,500 for Florida, 6,000 for Mississippi. And they just now announced this, OK, a couple days ago.
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:58:02.440]  And they're just now starting to arrive. So that's confirmed. Yes. And that's been on the news.
[02:58:02.440 --> 02:58:12.440]  What has not been confirmed is that they're preparing to evacuate and force people out. But I mean, as crazy as that sounds, no reason to evacuate from some oil.
[02:58:12.440 --> 02:58:21.440]  FEMA will use any excuse to set the precedent that it's the boss. And that's why they love this oil spill going on forever.
[02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:29.440]  But I don't want to hear Jindal and everybody complaining about the Fed's non-response and saying we're not allowed to boo who the feds won't let us.
[02:58:29.440 --> 02:58:36.440]  Well, then you've got the 9th and 10th Amendment. You know, the federal government is not there to blow your nose.
[02:58:36.440 --> 02:58:42.440]  But the federal government saying you're not allowed to blow your own nose, they've got to do it.
[02:58:42.440 --> 02:58:50.440]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[02:58:50.440 --> 02:58:59.440]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:59.440 --> 02:59:08.440]  My answer would be all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it?
[02:59:08.440 --> 02:59:16.440]  Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:16.440 --> 02:59:25.440]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:25.440 --> 02:59:34.440]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:34.440 --> 02:59:53.440]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:53.440 --> 03:00:00.440]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:00.440 --> 03:00:29.440]  Well, Pastor Lindsey Williams is with us in this fourth and final hour today. He, of course, was a pastor in the oil fields back in the 70s in Alaska.
[03:00:29.440 --> 03:00:34.440]  And then was brought in to be the chaplain in between these large corporate meetings between CEOs.
[03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:47.440]  He wrote a book, Energy Non Crisis, that was a bestseller, that's now become mainstream news that a very small portion of the oil that is brought out of Alaska is used in the U.S. about 20%.
[03:00:47.440 --> 03:00:54.440]  Some years it's 25%, but normally about 80% gets shipped out to Asia.
[03:00:54.440 --> 03:01:03.440]  And they could build more pipelines. There's more oil there than in Saudi Arabia. That's now admitted. They covered it up for 25 years now. It's been admitted.
[03:01:03.440 --> 03:01:16.440]  Obama announces they're going to allow drilling, and then magically, BP CEO dumps a third of his stock, Goldman Sachs, who was the chairman of Goldman Sachs.
[03:01:16.440 --> 03:01:27.440]  That happened to be the international chairman of BP when this happened. Isn't that just special? And they dumped 44% of their stock two days before record dumping.
[03:01:27.440 --> 03:01:35.440]  There was this strange refitting done that no one will say who did it. Obama said I'm sending SWAT teams at first, like it could be terrorism.
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:39.440]  Some say he wants to use this to nationalize oil companies.
[03:01:39.440 --> 03:01:47.440]  No, he's in the Washington Post saying he wants to get a carbon tax pass now to pay for this. So it is really bizarre.
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:52.440]  And in this hour, we're going to go to your phone calls.
[03:01:52.440 --> 03:02:00.440]  Gary John Terry is a petroleum engineer for 12 years. Matt in Ohio, Mike and Mass.
[03:02:00.440 --> 03:02:04.440]  And the petroleum engineer says they're a 12-year insider with Halliburton.
[03:02:04.440 --> 03:02:10.440]  So we're going to intersperse calls with Lindsay Williams. And I'm going to go to the petroleum engineer and we come back in the next segment.
[03:02:10.440 --> 03:02:14.440]  So we're limited on time today, Lindsay. We appreciate you breaking this here.
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:23.440]  So can you give us a boil-down synopsis of the information in total, and then over the hour, we'll go through different facets of it in more detail.
[03:02:23.440 --> 03:02:35.440]  Alex, thank you for letting me be with you. I contacted Mr. X with my book The Energy Non-Crisis for the truth of what really happened and is happening.
[03:02:35.440 --> 03:02:49.440]  He was willing to tell me everything. And what he told me, I knew that the Alex Jones show is the only place that I can get this information out to the masses quick enough before they can stop it from being given.
[03:02:49.440 --> 03:03:00.440]  He basically told me what happened and what is happening and what is going to happen in the Gulf of Mexico oil gusher.
[03:03:00.440 --> 03:03:09.440]  Well, Lindsay, I'm almost holding my breath. I almost don't want to know, but tell us what he said.
[03:03:09.440 --> 03:03:14.440]  Well, first of all, what people are going to hear on your show today is catastrophic.
[03:03:14.440 --> 03:03:22.440]  I beg of them to get a pencil and piece of paper and take notes and send this program to every person you know.
[03:03:22.440 --> 03:03:32.440]  The people of America must know the truth about the Gulf of Mexico oil gusher because the oil is not. I hope you're hearing this word.
[03:03:32.440 --> 03:03:43.440]  The oil is not the greatest danger. That black stuff in the water that comes up with the oil is what is deadly.
[03:03:43.440 --> 03:03:52.440]  The oil itself only destroys wildlife and fish and oysters and shrimp and the pristine white beaches and the marshlands and the coral reefs.
[03:03:52.440 --> 03:04:00.440]  What comes out with that gusher is causing the death of humans and unborn babies.
[03:04:00.440 --> 03:04:21.440]  And I'm going to give the details of this today exactly as was given to me by the Mr. X in my book, The Energy Non Crisis. Please, folks, believe me, this is so catastrophic that I have never had anything like this in my years to ever come my way.
[03:04:21.440 --> 03:04:33.440]  Well, again, this is a former oil company CEO and you've certainly got good intel from him before when fuel was at $55 a barrel in early 2008.
[03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:40.440]  You talked to him and he said it was going to go up to $150. It did do that. People laughed at you at the time.
[03:04:40.440 --> 03:04:55.440]  I hope he's wrong about this, but we'll get your breakdown of this on the other side. Then we'll talk to Terry in Ohio, Gary, John, Matt, Mike and everybody else. Everybody stay there. We're going to get to you coming up.
[03:04:55.440 --> 03:05:11.440]  But first, Lindsay Williams on the other side.
[03:05:26.440 --> 03:05:35.440]  And also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products.
[03:05:35.440 --> 03:05:40.440]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:05:40.440 --> 03:05:46.440]  Very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided making production fast and simple.
[03:05:46.440 --> 03:06:00.440]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:06:00.440 --> 03:06:04.440]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:06:04.440 --> 03:06:09.440]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:06:09.440 --> 03:06:15.440]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:06:15.440 --> 03:06:20.440]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:06:20.440 --> 03:06:24.440]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:06:24.440 --> 03:06:28.440]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:06:28.440 --> 03:06:31.440]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:06:31.440 --> 03:06:35.440]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[03:06:35.440 --> 03:06:40.440]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:06:40.440 --> 03:06:44.440]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science.
[03:06:44.440 --> 03:06:45.440]  One of my oldest sponsors.

[03:06:59.440 --> 03:07:03.440]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[03:07:03.440 --> 03:07:07.440]  Not detergents, but good old fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company,
[03:07:07.440 --> 03:07:10.440]  a family owned and operated American company.
[03:07:10.440 --> 03:07:14.440]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me
[03:07:14.440 --> 03:07:17.440]  how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[03:07:17.440 --> 03:07:22.440]  There is nothing like these factory direct, big money saving triple concentrated soaps anywhere.

[03:07:31.440 --> 03:07:35.440]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[03:07:35.440 --> 03:07:42.440]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:07:42.440 --> 03:07:46.440]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[03:07:46.440 --> 03:07:55.440]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091, visit our website, 5starsoap.com,
[03:07:55.440 --> 03:08:09.440]  to find our one to two month soap sampler. Thank you.
[03:08:09.440 --> 03:08:13.440]  Well, Lindsay Williams has made predictions that have come true time and time again,
[03:08:13.440 --> 03:08:20.440]  just like other analysts we have on like Gerald Solente yesterday,
[03:08:20.440 --> 03:08:23.440]  but this isn't really somebody analyzing, you know, though he's a smart guy.
[03:08:23.440 --> 03:08:30.440]  This is a former oil company CEO that Lindsay worked with for many years,
[03:08:30.440 --> 03:08:35.440]  that is a globalist that's a good source of info, and so it's some insider info,
[03:08:35.440 --> 03:08:39.440]  and so he's going to give us a synopsis, then I'm going to take some calls,
[03:08:39.440 --> 03:08:41.440]  then he's going to flush it out in more detail.
[03:08:41.440 --> 03:08:45.440]  But Lindsay, you know, they have said a lot of the workers are getting sick,
[03:08:45.440 --> 03:08:49.440]  and we're cleaning this up. I thought it was because of the dispersant they're using,
[03:08:49.440 --> 03:08:53.440]  which they admit is much more toxic than crude oil. I know some toxic things come out
[03:08:53.440 --> 03:08:57.440]  of certain types of wells, especially deep wells, but you were telling me,
[03:08:57.440 --> 03:09:00.440]  and now even the EPA today, you were trying to get a hold of me last week,
[03:09:00.440 --> 03:09:05.440]  but here you are now, now the EPA has come out and said,
[03:09:05.440 --> 03:09:10.440]  yeah, there's a bunch of other toxic stuff coming out in this half million gallons a day,
[03:09:10.440 --> 03:09:14.440]  and people have noticed a lot of times black isn't coming out of the hole,
[03:09:14.440 --> 03:09:19.440]  brown and green, and of course from undersea cameras it distorts the colors,
[03:09:19.440 --> 03:09:24.440]  but other stuff other than oil clearly is coming out, and people are saying,
[03:09:24.440 --> 03:09:28.440]  you know, is it a mud volcano? You know, what is it?
[03:09:28.440 --> 03:09:32.440]  And now there's two other fissures they've confirmed miles away leaking,
[03:09:32.440 --> 03:09:37.440]  and we know sometimes, like in the Beverly Hillbillies, I mean it's fiction,
[03:09:37.440 --> 03:09:41.440]  but Jed Clampett shoots at a squirrel and up from the ground came a bubble,
[03:09:41.440 --> 03:09:48.440]  and crude, Texas tea, black gold, but so in a lot of cases in the U.S.,
[03:09:48.440 --> 03:09:53.440]  La Brea Tar Pit in LA, oil comes up on its own on the seabed,
[03:09:53.440 --> 03:09:57.440]  so did they get into some mega fissure or something?
[03:09:57.440 --> 03:10:01.440]  Break it down for us from your inside sources, exactly what's going on here,
[03:10:01.440 --> 03:10:03.440]  Lindsey Williams.
[03:10:03.440 --> 03:10:07.440]  Alex, please allow me to give just a very brief background to what happened
[03:10:07.440 --> 03:10:11.440]  in the Gulf of Mexico. Sure, you've got the floor, and then we're going to get a call
[03:10:11.440 --> 03:10:14.440]  from somebody who says they're a Halliburton insider, go ahead.
[03:10:14.440 --> 03:10:19.440]  Okay, in 1970, the Russians drilled that coal ST3 wells,
[03:10:19.440 --> 03:10:25.440]  an exploratory well which finally reached a staggering world record depth of 40,230 feet.
[03:10:25.440 --> 03:10:29.440]  Since then, Russia and their major oil company, Ucus,
[03:10:29.440 --> 03:10:34.440]  have quietly drilled 310 successfully deep wells,
[03:10:34.440 --> 03:10:38.440]  putting them into production, and last year, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia
[03:10:38.440 --> 03:10:42.440]  as the world's largest single oil producer, and it's now set to completely dominate
[03:10:42.440 --> 03:10:46.440]  global oil production and the sales for the next century.
[03:10:46.440 --> 03:10:52.440]  What they found was a biotic fuel when they got the oil, when they got to that depth.
[03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:56.440]  Now, please write this down, A-B-I-O-T-I-C oil.
[03:10:56.440 --> 03:11:00.440]  It is from the chemical process that's taking place in the heart of the Earth,
[03:11:00.440 --> 03:11:04.440]  and as a result, the textbooks on oil are going to have to be rewritten
[03:11:04.440 --> 03:11:09.440]  because it is not a fossil fuel, and there is no such thing as peak oil,
[03:11:09.440 --> 03:11:15.440]  and the shallow oil wells of Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Mexico are replenishing
[03:11:15.440 --> 03:11:20.440]  from these deep sources. Now, Russia had sense enough,
[03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:23.440]  and please notice this word, it's emphatic.
[03:11:23.440 --> 03:11:28.440]  Russia had sense enough to drill that coal ST3 well on the land,
[03:11:28.440 --> 03:11:33.440]  not in the Gulf of Mexico. Now, what is happening in the Gulf of Mexico?
[03:11:33.440 --> 03:11:38.440]  I contacted Mr. X, and he said, here's what happened.
[03:11:38.440 --> 03:11:42.440]  What I found out is frightening. I mean, it scares me.
[03:11:42.440 --> 03:11:47.440]  It appears that British Petroleum, BP, not an American oil company,
[03:11:47.440 --> 03:11:52.440]  it should have never been allowed to take place. Our government made a horrible mistake.
[03:11:52.440 --> 03:11:56.440]  They allowed British Petroleum to try to do what Russia did
[03:11:56.440 --> 03:12:02.440]  and drill a super deep well, not on land, but do stupid.
[03:12:02.440 --> 03:12:09.440]  BP was so stupid as to try drilling in the ocean, all sure,
[03:12:09.440 --> 03:12:13.440]  on a floating platform. Are you catching all of these words?
[03:12:13.440 --> 03:12:18.440]  This platform is controlled and kept in place by sophisticated GPS equipment.
[03:12:18.440 --> 03:12:23.440]  In the Gulf of Mexico, in wherever, it's 5,000 feet deep.
[03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:28.440]  Yeah, it's got big, robotically controlled jets and propellers,
[03:12:28.440 --> 03:12:31.440]  just like cruise ships have to keep them from rocking.
[03:12:31.440 --> 03:12:37.440]  It has a similar system, it's firing, I think they call it an ASAPOD system to keep it in place.
[03:12:37.440 --> 03:12:42.440]  Yes, they, and I keep in mind, one mile is 5,280.
[03:12:42.440 --> 03:12:47.440]  They went down 5,000 feet in water, and then they began their drilling,
[03:12:47.440 --> 03:12:51.440]  and here's the depth they went to. This is right from BP's.
[03:12:51.440 --> 03:12:55.440]  Now, there are some people in BP that are so concerned for human beings
[03:12:55.440 --> 03:12:58.440]  and love our nation to the point that they have told me the story.
[03:12:58.440 --> 03:13:04.440]  I had two BP informants along with my Mr. X of the energy non-crisis.
[03:13:04.440 --> 03:13:11.440]  Now, they drilled between 25,000 and 30,000 feet deep in 5,000 foot water.
[03:13:11.440 --> 03:13:15.440]  That means that they went somewhere between 30,000 and 30,000 feet.
[03:13:15.440 --> 03:13:17.440]  This is what is called a super deep well.
[03:13:17.440 --> 03:13:23.440]  They did something so catastrophic and unexpected that they could not contain it.
[03:13:23.440 --> 03:13:28.440]  And the news is now admitted that three hours before, they had executives and engineers
[03:13:28.440 --> 03:13:32.440]  and petroleum geologists rushing out there on helicopters
[03:13:32.440 --> 03:13:34.440]  because they knew something was about to happen.
[03:13:34.440 --> 03:13:39.440]  That's exactly right, and it did, except it was much worse than they ever thought.
[03:13:39.440 --> 03:13:46.440]  Now, let me state very emphatically, this positively is not a conspiracy.
[03:13:46.440 --> 03:13:49.440]  They did not intend for this to happen.
[03:13:49.440 --> 03:13:51.440]  This is an accident.
[03:13:51.440 --> 03:13:58.440]  They hit a straddle of oil at such high pressure that it burst all of their safety belts.
[03:13:58.440 --> 03:14:03.440]  The pressure behind the oil is so high that it destroyed the maximum efforts
[03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:05.440]  of human science to contain it.
[03:14:05.440 --> 03:14:12.440]  And in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, for instance, the oil is in the ground
[03:14:12.440 --> 03:14:16.440]  and it blocks over 1,500 pounds of natural autesian pressure.
[03:14:16.440 --> 03:14:20.440]  And when I was sapling there, I watched many oil wells being brought in.
[03:14:20.440 --> 03:14:28.440]  The very first thing that they gave in an oil well that Prudhoe Bay was the flow rate of the well head.
[03:14:28.440 --> 03:14:32.440]  The second thing they would always give immediately is the pressure,
[03:14:32.440 --> 03:14:35.440]  the autesian pressure coming up with that oil.
[03:14:35.440 --> 03:14:39.440]  Have you ever noticed, and now you can think of this for a moment, Alex,
[03:14:39.440 --> 03:14:44.440]  that nowhere, no media, nobody has told anything about the well.
[03:14:44.440 --> 03:14:49.440]  No, that is the first thing they do is they get a well reading on its pressure
[03:14:49.440 --> 03:14:51.440]  and we haven't heard what pressure is coming out.
[03:14:51.440 --> 03:14:56.440]  They don't dare tell what pressure came out because in the Gulf of Mexico,
[03:14:56.440 --> 03:15:03.440]  the BP oil well, what they have announced is so different than what really is.
[03:15:03.440 --> 03:15:07.440]  But see, that fits in with the fact that there's other fissures miles away
[03:15:07.440 --> 03:15:11.440]  and it's coming up with such pressure like a water hose going into the dirt can burrow.
[03:15:11.440 --> 03:15:17.440]  It's coming up from below and blasting up, almost like a volcano, creating other fissures.
[03:15:17.440 --> 03:15:21.440]  But we're going to find out from a fellow that says they're petroleum geologists just in a moment.
[03:15:21.440 --> 03:15:23.440]  But please continue, Lindsay.
[03:15:23.440 --> 03:15:29.440]  Yes, keep in mind that the tar on your automobile is 35 pounds per square inch approximately.
[03:15:29.440 --> 03:15:34.440]  If you were driving a tractor trailer rig, you'd have 100 pounds per square inch.
[03:15:34.440 --> 03:15:42.440]  This is a reliable source, estimated to me, with BP, that the Gulf of Mexico oil gusher
[03:15:42.440 --> 03:15:45.440]  with a well head pressure between, you ready?
[03:15:45.440 --> 03:15:48.440]  This is astronomical.
[03:15:48.440 --> 03:15:55.440]  They hit a well head pressure of somewhere between 20,000 and 70,000 pounds per square inch.
[03:15:55.440 --> 03:15:59.440]  This is beyond human technology to contain it.
[03:15:59.440 --> 03:16:02.440]  There are many safety devices on that well.
[03:16:02.440 --> 03:16:04.440]  They blew every single one of them.
[03:16:04.440 --> 03:16:07.440]  Is that why the government's now saying they may use a nuke on it?
[03:16:07.440 --> 03:16:12.440]  Well, we'll get to the nuke in a little bit, but I need to give some of the other details first.
[03:16:12.440 --> 03:16:16.440]  And then I'm going to tell you exactly what this man said to me is the only thing can be done about it.
[03:16:16.440 --> 03:16:22.440]  Now, these safety devices, there's one of them down there called a fail safe valve.
[03:16:22.440 --> 03:16:25.440]  Anybody in the oil business will recognize this immediately.
[03:16:25.440 --> 03:16:30.440]  The fail safe valve is the one that's supposed to hold if everything else holds
[03:16:30.440 --> 03:16:32.440]  and all of the other safety devices blow.
[03:16:32.440 --> 03:16:34.440]  This one is supposed to hold.
[03:16:34.440 --> 03:16:40.440]  This is what I'm about to give right now, has never been told anywhere and you'll never hear it
[03:16:40.440 --> 03:16:45.440]  unless you happen to go to the BP informant that I had and they said to me,
[03:16:45.440 --> 03:16:51.440]  they said, Chaplin, there was a conversation between the worker and the foreman on the rig
[03:16:51.440 --> 03:16:57.440]  not long before the blast took place and the worker said to the foreman,
[03:16:57.440 --> 03:17:00.440]  the fail safe valve is worked.
[03:17:00.440 --> 03:17:02.440]  There is a defective in it.
[03:17:02.440 --> 03:17:05.440]  We've got to replace it before we go any further.
[03:17:05.440 --> 03:17:09.440]  The foreman on the oil platform said to the worker, we don't have time.
[03:17:09.440 --> 03:17:11.440]  Let's continue going.
[03:17:11.440 --> 03:17:15.440]  It was just after that that the Gulf of Mexico oil wells flowed
[03:17:15.440 --> 03:17:22.440]  and it is flowing today approximately four million gallons a day along with the fishers.
[03:17:22.440 --> 03:17:28.440]  Now they have been caught, first they said it was 5,000, then 20,000, then 100,000, then 500,000.
[03:17:28.440 --> 03:17:32.440]  You're saying it's millions of gallons from your BP source.
[03:17:32.440 --> 03:17:34.440]  That is correct.
[03:17:34.440 --> 03:17:38.440]  Now, will BP be able to stop the flow of the oil?
[03:17:38.440 --> 03:17:40.440]  You ready?
[03:17:40.440 --> 03:17:44.440]  That makes sense though the way they're keeping the media back, boy, I'm being suspicious.
[03:17:44.440 --> 03:17:48.440]  So you're saying this is a super mega disaster.
[03:17:48.440 --> 03:17:53.440]  This is a super mega disaster of something that the United States of America has never experienced
[03:17:53.440 --> 03:17:58.440]  and the world has never experienced and the pressures on this well were so extreme
[03:17:58.440 --> 03:18:01.440]  compared to even what Russia hit years ago in that cold.
[03:18:01.440 --> 03:18:05.440]  Well, I've got to say it, you know, I mean, Lindsay Williams, it does seem like America,
[03:18:05.440 --> 03:18:07.440]  the whole world seems like it's cursed now.
[03:18:07.440 --> 03:18:10.440]  All the bad things that are happening constantly?
[03:18:10.440 --> 03:18:13.440]  Well, BP has tried everything, yeah, you're right.
[03:18:13.440 --> 03:18:16.440]  BP has tried everything in their power to stop this well.
[03:18:16.440 --> 03:18:20.440]  They've used every scientific method that they can,
[03:18:20.440 --> 03:18:24.440]  but the truth of the matter is this individual said to me,
[03:18:24.440 --> 03:18:29.440]  he said, but, he said there's only one thing that is going to stop this.
[03:18:29.440 --> 03:18:34.440]  And he said it's a nuclear device, but he immediately said, but.
[03:18:34.440 --> 03:18:36.440]  And I said, what do you mean?
[03:18:36.440 --> 03:18:43.440]  He said, if we angle drill and put in a nuclear device and blow what is presently there,
[03:18:43.440 --> 03:18:48.440]  he said, if we get success, we'll be the heroes of the world.
[03:18:48.440 --> 03:18:52.440]  He said, Chaplin, I am scared and I could hear it in his voice.
[03:18:52.440 --> 03:18:57.440]  He said, if we explode that nuclear device and this strata of oil,
[03:18:57.440 --> 03:19:01.440]  which nobody has ever drilled into one with this pressure before,
[03:19:01.440 --> 03:19:05.440]  he said, if we fail and we rupture that strata first,
[03:19:05.440 --> 03:19:11.440]  then what it already is and poems have been reported as much as five and 20 miles away,
[03:19:11.440 --> 03:19:13.440]  until you just a moment or two.
[03:19:13.440 --> 03:19:17.440]  He said, if we rupture that strata further with that nuclear device,
[03:19:17.440 --> 03:19:20.440]  he said, Chaplin, I don't even want to think about it.
[03:19:20.440 --> 03:19:23.440]  Well, more and more evidence does point towards abiotic oil
[03:19:23.440 --> 03:19:27.440]  because the old oil wells are filling back up.
[03:19:27.440 --> 03:19:30.440]  It is being generated, it is coming from somewhere.
[03:19:30.440 --> 03:19:35.440]  And, of course, they do find coal that has ferns in it.
[03:19:35.440 --> 03:19:40.440]  It's clear that there is some oil that is produced from dead plankton
[03:19:40.440 --> 03:19:42.440]  and things that they find natural gas.
[03:19:42.440 --> 03:19:45.440]  From the petroleum geologist I've talked to out in the ocean
[03:19:45.440 --> 03:19:51.440]  at shallower depths that they do believe did come from rotting plant and animal life,
[03:19:51.440 --> 03:19:53.440]  but that there is another type of oil.
[03:19:53.440 --> 03:19:55.440]  Look, it's a big debate.
[03:19:55.440 --> 03:19:58.440]  We'll continue with Lindsay Williams and I promise we're going to get to this fella
[03:19:58.440 --> 03:20:01.440]  that says he's a petroleum geologist on the other side.
[03:20:01.440 --> 03:20:05.440]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:20:05.440 --> 03:20:08.440]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[03:20:08.440 --> 03:20:10.440]  how much ammunition do you want?
[03:20:10.440 --> 03:20:13.440]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom
[03:20:13.440 --> 03:20:15.440]  and the lives of your loved ones.
[03:20:15.440 --> 03:20:17.440]  Food is your only ammunition.
[03:20:17.440 --> 03:20:19.440]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[03:20:19.440 --> 03:20:21.440]  Now or after the battle starts.
[03:20:21.440 --> 03:20:22.440]  When will you need it?
[03:20:22.440 --> 03:20:24.440]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:20:24.440 --> 03:20:27.440]  Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[03:20:27.440 --> 03:20:30.440]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[03:20:30.440 --> 03:20:32.440]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:20:32.440 --> 03:20:36.440]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:20:36.440 --> 03:20:40.440]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:20:40.440 --> 03:20:42.440]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[03:20:42.440 --> 03:20:44.440]  How much do you want? All you can get.
[03:20:44.440 --> 03:20:45.440]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:20:45.440 --> 03:20:48.440]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:20:48.440 --> 03:20:56.440]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:20:56.440 --> 03:21:00.440]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:21:01.440 --> 03:21:03.440]  Gold isn't for you.
[03:21:03.440 --> 03:21:05.440]  Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources.
[03:21:05.440 --> 03:21:08.440]  One of the world's premier gold and precious metal investing firms.
[03:21:08.440 --> 03:21:09.440]  I get it.
[03:21:09.440 --> 03:21:12.440]  You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job,
[03:21:12.440 --> 03:21:16.440]  that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy,
[03:21:16.440 --> 03:21:18.440]  that social security would be there for you.
[03:21:18.440 --> 03:21:20.440]  That's not what's happening.
[03:21:20.440 --> 03:21:24.440]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation,
[03:21:24.440 --> 03:21:28.440]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value, or that your retirement would be secure.
[03:21:28.440 --> 03:21:31.440]  If all looks rosy to you, then now is not the time to buy gold.
[03:21:31.440 --> 03:21:35.440]  For the realists, there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold.
[03:21:35.440 --> 03:21:41.440]  Since 2001, the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold has risen 300%.
[03:21:41.440 --> 03:21:45.440]  Right now, savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios.
[03:21:45.440 --> 03:21:46.440]  You should too.
[03:21:46.440 --> 03:21:47.440]  Find out what they know.
[03:21:47.440 --> 03:21:50.440]  Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well.
[03:21:50.440 --> 03:21:51.440]  Free.
[03:21:51.440 --> 03:21:53.440]  800-686-2237.
[03:21:53.440 --> 03:21:56.440]  800-686-2237.
[03:21:56.440 --> 03:22:01.440]  That's 800-686-2237.
[03:22:01.440 --> 03:22:03.440]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:22:03.440 --> 03:22:06.440]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:22:06.440 --> 03:22:09.440]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:22:09.440 --> 03:22:14.440]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:22:14.440 --> 03:22:18.440]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:22:18.440 --> 03:22:21.440]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:22:21.440 --> 03:22:27.440]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[03:22:27.440 --> 03:22:35.440]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:22:35.440 --> 03:22:40.440]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:22:40.440 --> 03:22:43.440]  Global governance with the establishment of a G20.
[03:22:43.440 --> 03:22:47.440]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:22:47.440 --> 03:22:49.440]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[03:23:28.440 --> 03:23:34.440]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[03:23:34.440 --> 03:23:39.440]  Herb K was right. His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[03:23:39.440 --> 03:23:43.440]  What have you got to lose? Stop the calls now, get out of debt and have more money.

[03:24:04.440 --> 03:24:10.440]  Don't worry, this show is documented. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:24:10.440 --> 03:24:15.440]  Well look, I promised to take your calls in this hour, but I also want to hear from Lindsay Williams
[03:24:15.440 --> 03:24:18.440]  because he was telling me during the break I've never heard him this concerned.
[03:24:18.440 --> 03:24:24.440]  And listen, Alex, I've got a lot more to tell you. We haven't even gotten to the real meat and potatoes yet.
[03:24:24.440 --> 03:24:28.440]  Well, I thought that was the meat and potatoes. Again, I don't want to hear what he's about to say next
[03:24:28.440 --> 03:24:34.440]  because they are acting freaked out about this and that sucker is a lot bigger than what they first said.
[03:24:34.440 --> 03:24:38.440]  And they just can't cap it, they won't cap it.
[03:24:38.440 --> 03:24:43.440]  Then you've got the federal response, not letting the states respond to it.
[03:24:43.440 --> 03:24:48.440]  I'm really afraid Obama is going to get his carbon tax through this crisis like Rahm Emanuel said.
[03:24:48.440 --> 03:24:54.440]  Don't let any crisis go to waste. But Terry in Ohio says they're a petroleum engineer for 12 years.
[03:24:54.440 --> 03:25:00.440]  Worked with Halliburton. You know, I don't know why I haven't called petroleum engineers that I personally know.
[03:25:00.440 --> 03:25:06.440]  I mean, I guess early on I thought, okay, petroleum spill, yeah, big deal, media distraction.
[03:25:06.440 --> 03:25:11.440]  But it is getting crazier and crazier. So we're going to go back to Lindsay Williams.
[03:25:11.440 --> 03:25:16.440]  He's sitting here with us, but going to Terry. Terry, what's your take on all this?
[03:25:16.440 --> 03:25:21.440]  Well, Alex, you know, I've been talking about this ever since I heard it happen.
[03:25:21.440 --> 03:25:28.440]  And I've told people right from the very beginning, first of all, I even told my wife,
[03:25:28.440 --> 03:25:35.440]  the only way you're going to be able to stop anything since you got all the wreckage and pipe and everything else
[03:25:35.440 --> 03:25:42.440]  down on top of the on the well site will be scattered all over the place down there because it floated to the bottom.
[03:25:42.440 --> 03:25:48.440]  But you had things that was connected to it also that's going to kind of like bring it down and move some pieces
[03:25:48.440 --> 03:25:55.440]  depending on how it fell down on the bottom. But I even said then that the only option that you would have
[03:25:55.440 --> 03:26:01.440]  would be to set off a small nuclear bomb.
[03:26:01.440 --> 03:26:07.440]  But, you know, the thing about it is, you know, just to like feel the well to well, you know, to create,
[03:26:07.440 --> 03:26:14.440]  like, you know, cauterize it. But see, you, first of all, you know, I told, like I was telling others,
[03:26:14.440 --> 03:26:19.440]  you know, you got to look at, you're at 5,000 feet deep in water.
[03:26:19.440 --> 03:26:28.440]  Well, you know, you're almost a temperature level down there is almost, you know, close to sub zero.
[03:26:28.440 --> 03:26:31.440]  You know what I mean? It's really cold down there.
[03:26:31.440 --> 03:26:39.440]  And then you've got to figure the pounds per square inch of your salt water that weighs over 9 pounds per gallon.
[03:26:39.440 --> 03:26:43.440]  And then you've got to figure a 5,000 feet deep, the weight there.
[03:26:43.440 --> 03:26:52.440]  So taking, and so you've got the weight of the water, the pressure at 5,000 feet, you've got the temperature factor.
[03:26:52.440 --> 03:27:02.440]  So you've got to overcome all those. So trying to determine what size nuke to use to cauterize this thing is almost impossible to figure.
[03:27:02.440 --> 03:27:04.440]  And here's something else you've got to look at.
[03:27:04.440 --> 03:27:07.440]  Well, let me ask you this question, though, and we'll get Lindsay's take on it.
[03:27:07.440 --> 03:27:13.440]  If you've got all these fissures they've now confirmed, at least two, they believe three or more,
[03:27:13.440 --> 03:27:27.440]  three, four, five, six miles away, pluming up, is the high pressure now blowing out the casing and eroding into other channels in the rock and the seabed and coming up?
[03:27:27.440 --> 03:27:34.440]  And will this blast a bigger and bigger opening and potentially get worse?
[03:27:34.440 --> 03:27:47.440]  Well, I figure what actually really started the fissures, I mean, they already began when you had to blow out because you had the different safety measures in place,
[03:27:47.440 --> 03:27:53.440]  even though you're blowout preventers and different things like that, they're going to hold back pressure on that.
[03:27:53.440 --> 03:27:56.440]  So when that began to blow out, that almost did.
[03:27:56.440 --> 03:28:07.440]  Well, the well practically fracked itself as far as opening up directional fractures because it's always going to go to the point of least resistance, okay?
[03:28:07.440 --> 03:28:23.440]  And I've heard these terms fracking, but defined fracking, but then expanding on that, what did you think about what Lindsay said about the pressure of this well that he's getting from insiders?
[03:28:23.440 --> 03:28:36.440]  I agree with it because when you're going that deep into the earth's mantle, it would be very easy to come in contact with an oil source, an oil and gas source,
[03:28:36.440 --> 03:28:45.440]  but at the same time, the extreme pressures are coming from, you know, you've got your molten lava and all that stuff pushing up from the center of the earth,
[03:28:45.440 --> 03:28:47.440]  so you've got all those inner earth pressures.
[03:28:47.440 --> 03:28:58.440]  Well, that's another thing, they could have gone into a, they could have gone into a batholift for those that don't know, that's a magma bubble up into the higher levels of the crust.
[03:28:58.440 --> 03:29:01.440]  Yeah, and you know that that's true too, Alex, because I'll tell you why.
[03:29:01.440 --> 03:29:12.440]  It's just like I was explaining to my wife and others, you know how they're finding these like tar patties and things like that on the sands in Pensacola, Florida and those places.
[03:29:12.440 --> 03:29:13.440]  Yeah.
[03:29:13.440 --> 03:29:27.440]  Okay, what causes that is this, not only do you have extreme pressure, but you, but that oil and gas mixture is heated and it is so hot, okay?
[03:29:27.440 --> 03:29:38.440]  Now, it's coming up out of the ground under extreme pressure and then when it hits that cold water, it begins to cool, it's just like a lava flow as soon as it hits the ocean.
[03:29:38.440 --> 03:29:39.440]  Exactly.
[03:29:39.440 --> 03:29:43.440]  And then all the brown stuff coming up is that sand, dirt being propelled out.
[03:29:43.440 --> 03:29:45.440]  We're going to come back with Lindsay Williams.
[03:29:45.440 --> 03:29:47.440]  This gets worse by the minute, folks.
[03:29:47.440 --> 03:29:50.440]  I tell you, I'm late getting to the party on this one.
[03:29:50.440 --> 03:29:52.440]  We're on the march.
[03:29:52.440 --> 03:29:54.440]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.440 --> 03:29:58.440]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:29:58.440 --> 03:30:04.440]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:30:04.440 --> 03:30:09.440]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:30:09.440 --> 03:30:12.440]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:30:12.440 --> 03:30:17.440]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[03:30:17.440 --> 03:30:24.440]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:30:24.440 --> 03:30:30.440]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:30:30.440 --> 03:30:34.440]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:30:34.440 --> 03:30:39.440]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:30:39.440 --> 03:30:45.440]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:30:45.440 --> 03:30:48.440]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:30:48.440 --> 03:30:50.440]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:30:50.440 --> 03:30:51.440]  It's here.

[03:33:29.440 --> 03:33:39.440]  A batholith is, you know, normally the crust of the earth is 10,000, 15,000, 20,000 feet thick, depending on which area of the earth.
[03:33:39.440 --> 03:33:50.440]  A volcano, obviously an active volcano, is where the crust gets hauled out by a batholith or a magma chamber and makes it to the surface.
[03:33:50.440 --> 03:33:57.440]  And if you go to Enchanted Rock outside Austin, Texas, it's a big mountain of pink and gray granite.
[03:33:57.440 --> 03:34:05.440]  Very beautiful. It looks like a big, you know, half soccer ball sticking up out of the ground, basically.
[03:34:05.440 --> 03:34:10.440]  And it's a batholith because it pushes the crust up or a mountain up above it.
[03:34:10.440 --> 03:34:19.440]  Over time, that erodes away and you've got a perfectly, you know, round dome of frozen lava.
[03:34:19.440 --> 03:34:27.440]  Cooled magma. And talking to petroleum geologists, and I've read about it in Russia and other places where they have been drilling down,
[03:34:27.440 --> 03:34:35.440]  not just 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, that they'll hit these and it just fries everything and explodes and it does cause a big leak.
[03:34:35.440 --> 03:34:40.440]  And then the Russians just kind of sweep it under the rug and don't even put it on their media because it's on land.
[03:34:40.440 --> 03:34:45.440]  And then it kills a bunch of people. Here, though, you do this in the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:34:45.440 --> 03:34:49.440]  Well, going back to Lindsay Williams, we're going to go 30 minutes into the next hour.
[03:34:49.440 --> 03:34:51.440]  I'm going to overdrive again today. I'm getting addicted to this.
[03:34:51.440 --> 03:34:56.440]  I did an hour and 15 minutes of extra broadcast yesterday, but we'll just do 30 minutes next hour.
[03:34:56.440 --> 03:35:01.440]  And I really appreciate Lindsay Williams coming on us because he's got BP sources and he has this former,
[03:35:01.440 --> 03:35:07.440]  well, I know the former CEO and so does Lindsay Williams, other colleague, Dr. Stan Monteef,
[03:35:07.440 --> 03:35:14.440]  because I believe Lindsay Williams, when he tells us all this, he's a good pastor, wrote a book 25 years ago that's now been admitted to be
[03:35:14.440 --> 03:35:17.440]  accurate, given his other predictions that come true.
[03:35:17.440 --> 03:35:23.440]  But Dr. Stan Monteef knew who this guy was like I did and actually called him, but I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:35:23.440 --> 03:35:25.440]  So this is real intel. Well, take it for what it's worth.
[03:35:25.440 --> 03:35:32.440]  The globalist of Bilderberg type guy, a former head of one of the big three oil companies, this is his view on it.
[03:35:32.440 --> 03:35:34.440]  We're getting it from Lindsay Williams.
[03:35:34.440 --> 03:35:40.440]  Lindsay, that petroleum geologist that called in, backed up what you had to say, please continue.
[03:35:40.440 --> 03:35:46.440]  But this looks like they drilled into some type of magma chamber or batholith.
[03:35:46.440 --> 03:35:51.440]  Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat from Florida.
[03:35:51.440 --> 03:35:56.440]  He appeared yesterday, June the 9th on MSNBC.
[03:35:56.440 --> 03:35:58.440]  Andrea Mitchell interviewed it.
[03:35:58.440 --> 03:36:00.440]  You can go and look at this, please do.
[03:36:00.440 --> 03:36:04.440]  He said oil is seeping up from the seabed.
[03:36:04.440 --> 03:36:13.440]  Now let me give you the report that was given on Tuesday of this week by NOAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[03:36:13.440 --> 03:36:15.440]  This is Chris Baltimore.
[03:36:15.440 --> 03:36:20.440]  You'll notice that I am very carefully documenting everything I am saying today, Alex.
[03:36:20.440 --> 03:36:22.440]  This man is from Houston.
[03:36:22.440 --> 03:36:24.440]  Disappeared on routers.
[03:36:24.440 --> 03:36:26.440]  Go and find it for yourself.
[03:36:26.440 --> 03:36:37.440]  It says, UX experts investigating reports of under-seas oil plumes emanating from BP's picked stricken whale in the Gulf of Mexico on Tuesday,
[03:36:37.440 --> 03:36:41.440]  concerned the presence of low levels of oil below the surface.
[03:36:41.440 --> 03:36:49.440]  NOAA is confirming the presence of very low concentrations of subsurface oil,
[03:36:49.440 --> 03:36:54.440]  and they have admitted now to under-seas plumes.
[03:36:54.440 --> 03:36:56.440]  Let me try to explain very quickly.
[03:36:56.440 --> 03:37:03.440]  Under-seas plumes, what the gentleman said just a moment ago that you took the phone call from, Alex, he's exactly right.
[03:37:03.440 --> 03:37:06.440]  When I heard him say it, I knew I'd get to it in a minute.
[03:37:06.440 --> 03:37:13.440]  Undoubtedly, whenever this extreme pressure of 20,000 to 70,000 pounds per square inch hit that pipe,
[03:37:13.440 --> 03:37:24.440]  it probably bursted at numerous points between the four where they had gone into this straddle of oil and the top of the pipe.
[03:37:24.440 --> 03:37:30.440]  And now that oil is leaking out as far as 20 miles away.
[03:37:30.440 --> 03:37:32.440]  Now, not just five.
[03:37:32.440 --> 03:37:39.440]  NOAA said that they had roughly been able to confirm 20-mile-away plumes.
[03:37:39.440 --> 03:37:42.440]  This means that this thing is fractured in many spots.
[03:37:42.440 --> 03:37:51.440]  And let me just add that a batholith is an underground magma chamber that has cooled.
[03:37:51.440 --> 03:37:55.440]  A lackalith is one that is still molten.
[03:37:55.440 --> 03:38:00.440]  And that was their concern with super deep drilling is that they would hit these underground magma chambers.
[03:38:00.440 --> 03:38:09.440]  And a lot of laymen looking at it coming out under pressure, record pressure, said it looks like a volcano.
[03:38:09.440 --> 03:38:12.440]  Well, what does your inside source say?
[03:38:12.440 --> 03:38:14.440]  I mean, because that's where this looks like this is leading.
[03:38:14.440 --> 03:38:16.440]  Yes, that's exactly correct.
[03:38:16.440 --> 03:38:19.440]  Now, let me go to something much more startling.
[03:38:19.440 --> 03:38:25.440]  The black oil in the water in the Gulf of Mexico is not the greatest danger.
[03:38:25.440 --> 03:38:27.440]  Are you hearing me?
[03:38:27.440 --> 03:38:33.440]  I mean, you've got to understand we are not being told by our president and by our congressman.
[03:38:33.440 --> 03:38:39.440]  And they know this, the black stuff that comes out that you call oil is just destroying wildlife.
[03:38:39.440 --> 03:38:46.440]  Fish and oysters and shrimp and fishermen's occupations and pristine white beaches and the marshlands and the coral reefs.
[03:38:46.440 --> 03:38:49.440]  What comes out with the oil?
[03:38:49.440 --> 03:38:55.440]  Most people don't realize this, Alex, that there are actually things that come out of the ground with the oil.
[03:38:55.440 --> 03:39:05.440]  And what comes out of the ground, out of that gusher, with the oil is causing the death of humans and unborn babies.
[03:39:05.440 --> 03:39:09.440]  Folks, please, I have never been so concerned in my life.
[03:39:09.440 --> 03:39:11.440]  Most people think only oil comes out.
[03:39:11.440 --> 03:39:13.440]  Oil is not the only thing that comes out.
[03:39:13.440 --> 03:39:14.440]  I'm going to give them to you.
[03:39:14.440 --> 03:39:18.440]  Right from the EPA, they came out with their report this week.
[03:39:18.440 --> 03:39:20.440]  This is the Environmental Protection Agency.
[03:39:20.440 --> 03:39:22.440]  They went to the Gulf.
[03:39:22.440 --> 03:39:30.440]  They made their test and they found coming out with the oil are some of the most toxic compounds and gases.
[03:39:30.440 --> 03:39:32.440]  They're in the air.
[03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:33.440]  They are flammable.
[03:39:33.440 --> 03:39:34.440]  They are toxic.
[03:39:34.440 --> 03:39:40.440]  And I'm going to name them for you and give you the report right from the Environmental Protection Agency.
[03:39:40.440 --> 03:39:41.440]  They are hiding this.
[03:39:41.440 --> 03:39:42.440]  I was able to get it.
[03:39:42.440 --> 03:39:44.440]  Please write these words down.
[03:39:44.440 --> 03:39:52.440]  They announced just this week, volatile organic compounds in the air in the Gulf.
[03:39:52.440 --> 03:39:53.440]  Did you get those words?
[03:39:53.440 --> 03:39:54.440]  This is very important.
[03:39:54.440 --> 03:39:56.440]  Volatile organic compounds.
[03:39:56.440 --> 03:39:58.440]  They listed some.
[03:39:58.440 --> 03:39:59.440]  I'm going to list them for you.
[03:39:59.440 --> 03:40:01.440]  This will scare the daylights out of you.
[03:40:01.440 --> 03:40:06.440]  In the atmosphere, in the Gulf, number one, hydrogen sulfide.
[03:40:06.440 --> 03:40:11.440]  The levels that are allowed according to the EPA is on statements.
[03:40:11.440 --> 03:40:19.440]  The allowable levels of hydrogen sulfide are 5 to 10 pots per billion.
[03:40:19.440 --> 03:40:21.440]  I'm saying these very carefully so you get it.
[03:40:21.440 --> 03:40:25.440]  P-P-B pots per billion.
[03:40:25.440 --> 03:40:32.440]  They tested in the last few days in the Gulf and the winds are carrying this to the shore.
[03:40:32.440 --> 03:40:34.440]  This scares the daylights out of me.
[03:40:34.440 --> 03:40:42.440]  Florida's getting it, Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, hydrogen sulfide.
[03:40:42.440 --> 03:40:45.440]  Safe levels, 5 to 10 pots per billion.
[03:40:45.440 --> 03:40:52.440]  Tested level this past week presently, 1,200 pots per billion.
[03:40:52.440 --> 03:40:54.440]  You'll wonder why people are getting sick.
[03:40:54.440 --> 03:40:56.440]  Let me give you the next one.
[03:40:56.440 --> 03:40:57.440]  Benzene.
[03:40:57.440 --> 03:40:58.440]  Oh, please.
[03:40:58.440 --> 03:41:03.440]  I'm going to read you the contents and how dangerous benzene is at the moment.
[03:41:03.440 --> 03:41:04.440]  Benzene.
[03:41:04.440 --> 03:41:06.440]  This is toxic.
[03:41:06.440 --> 03:41:08.440]  It causes malignancies.
[03:41:08.440 --> 03:41:11.440]  It's known to cause leukemia and cancer.
[03:41:11.440 --> 03:41:18.440]  The safe level according to the environmental protection agencies on records, it is so toxic.
[03:41:18.440 --> 03:41:24.440]  They only allow 0 to 4 pots per billion.
[03:41:24.440 --> 03:41:32.440]  The current level in the Gulf of Mexico going to the shore of all of those states and Florida being carried by the winds
[03:41:32.440 --> 03:41:37.440]  is 3,000 pots per billion.
[03:41:37.440 --> 03:41:40.440]  Folks, this is so startling.
[03:41:40.440 --> 03:41:45.440]  The people down there should at least be warned by this 13-year-old adult.
[03:41:45.440 --> 03:41:48.440]  We call the president of the United States of America.
[03:41:48.440 --> 03:41:53.440]  The people should at least be told by this man what they're breathing, what they're facing.
[03:41:53.440 --> 03:42:00.440]  And two, three, five, 10 years from now, we're going to have performed babies and people with respiratory problems.
[03:42:00.440 --> 03:42:02.440]  And people dying. I will give you one more.
[03:42:02.440 --> 03:42:03.440]  I must go back to benzene.
[03:42:03.440 --> 03:42:04.440]  Wait a minute.
[03:42:04.440 --> 03:42:07.440]  I got to read you what it says on benzene.
[03:42:07.440 --> 03:42:18.440]  Exposure to low levels of benzene can cause dizziness, drowsiness, headache, confusion, tremor, rapid heartbeat, and unconsciousness.
[03:42:18.440 --> 03:42:25.440]  Long-term exposure to benzene can cause damage in the bone marrow and lead to blood problems like leukemia.
[03:42:25.440 --> 03:42:33.440]  It also weakens the immune system and targets organs such as the kidneys, lungs, and the brain.
[03:42:33.440 --> 03:42:39.440]  Folks, this is so dangerous until even I, as a minister, shut up to think about it.
[03:42:39.440 --> 03:42:40.440]  I'm going to give you one more.
[03:42:40.440 --> 03:42:43.440]  It was in the EPA's report.
[03:42:43.440 --> 03:42:50.440]  Methylene chloride, safe levels of methylene chloride that person can breathe in the air.
[03:42:50.440 --> 03:42:56.440]  And this is airborne. In the Gulf, safe levels, 61 parts per billion.
[03:42:56.440 --> 03:43:06.440]  The current levels that were just found a few days ago by the EPA, 3,000 to 3,400 parts per billion.
[03:43:06.440 --> 03:43:12.440]  And the American people are not being warned that they're breathing this toxic, flammable stuff.
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:15.440]  And Alex, a hurricane.
[03:43:15.440 --> 03:43:21.440]  I shut it to think about it. A hurricane could carry this stuff all the way up the east coast of America.
[03:43:21.440 --> 03:43:27.440]  And no health care system in the world would ever be able to pay the hospital bills of what people are going to suffer.
[03:43:27.440 --> 03:43:28.440]  Alex, I'm sure you've heard of it.
[03:43:28.440 --> 03:43:33.440]  Well, the good news is, there's tens of trillions of gallons.
[03:43:33.440 --> 03:43:34.440]  In fact, I don't know the number.
[03:43:34.440 --> 03:43:41.440]  Guys, do a search engine on estimated gallons of water in the Gulf of Mexico slash Caribbean.
[03:43:41.440 --> 03:43:48.440]  I mean, the good news is, though, even though you're saying your sources have this at 4 or 5 million gallons a day and on 500 million,
[03:43:48.440 --> 03:43:54.440]  even though all that's going on, that a lot of this is going to be dispersed and diluted.
[03:43:54.440 --> 03:44:00.440]  I mean, I'm not saying it, but I mean, certainly the people are getting sick who are cleaning this up.
[03:44:00.440 --> 03:44:04.440]  And I had thought, I mean, I know there is some of these toxins in oil, depending on where you drill.
[03:44:04.440 --> 03:44:06.440]  It varies.
[03:44:06.440 --> 03:44:11.440]  As you know, Lindsay, working for oil companies, you have the sweet crew that's very clean.
[03:44:11.440 --> 03:44:13.440]  You have the regular crew that has a lot of other things in it.
[03:44:13.440 --> 03:44:18.440]  And a lot of the toxic waste that we deal with in the oil industry is the byproducts and what to do with it all.
[03:44:18.440 --> 03:44:22.440]  But anyway, you slice it as a catastrophe.
[03:44:22.440 --> 03:44:27.440]  But I mean, going back, you talked about nukes.
[03:44:27.440 --> 03:44:29.440]  And I remember this two weeks ago, now they're on Fox.
[03:44:29.440 --> 03:44:33.440]  Now they have the government saying, we may have to nuke, we may have to drill in and do this.
[03:44:33.440 --> 03:44:36.440]  What did your sources say about nukes?
[03:44:36.440 --> 03:44:38.440]  My source was scared to death.
[03:44:38.440 --> 03:44:45.440]  He said to me, he said, Chaplain, the only way that I can see to stop this is a nuclear device.
[03:44:45.440 --> 03:44:51.440]  And he said, but, and I could hear the fear in his voice.
[03:44:51.440 --> 03:44:59.440]  He said a nuke because of the strata that BP has drilled into, which nobody probably has ever drilled into before.
[03:44:59.440 --> 03:45:05.440]  And he said, because of the extreme prayer that's already there and what has happened to that pipe.
[03:45:05.440 --> 03:45:09.440]  He said, to put a nuke in there would take months in the first place.
[03:45:09.440 --> 03:45:13.440]  Because he said, we've got the angle drill in order to get down to it, to be able to do it.
[03:45:13.440 --> 03:45:21.440]  He said, Chaplain, the thing that frightens me so much is that if we use a nuke, that we might succeed.
[03:45:21.440 --> 03:45:23.440]  And he said, hopefully we can.
[03:45:23.440 --> 03:45:28.440]  But he said, if we don't, he said, we cracked that strata further.
[03:45:28.440 --> 03:45:30.440]  And it will never be stopped.
[03:45:30.440 --> 03:45:33.440]  And it will flow like this and even move forever.
[03:45:33.440 --> 03:45:35.440]  And he said, that frightens me.
[03:45:35.440 --> 03:45:36.440]  All right, let me bring this up.
[03:45:36.440 --> 03:45:37.440]  And I looked it up.
[03:45:37.440 --> 03:45:42.440]  Vanadium is a chemical element with a symbol V, an atomic number 23.
[03:45:42.440 --> 03:45:48.440]  It is a soft silver gray ductile transition metal.
[03:45:48.440 --> 03:45:52.440]  The formation of the oxide layer stabilizes the metal against oxidation.
[03:45:52.440 --> 03:45:56.440]  And it says it was discovered in 1801.
[03:45:56.440 --> 03:46:00.440]  And the report I've got here is, and this is an email.
[03:46:00.440 --> 03:46:01.440]  We have to look into this.
[03:46:01.440 --> 03:46:02.440]  This is unconfirmed.
[03:46:02.440 --> 03:46:06.440]  Only taking Gulf Coast calls.
[03:46:06.440 --> 03:46:11.440]  Two nights ago, my friend who works for a consultant with a toxicologist that works for the EPA,
[03:46:11.440 --> 03:46:16.440]  showed my friend and I, a private memo from a top EPA official,
[03:46:16.440 --> 03:46:23.440]  asking all consultants and researchers to pull up as much scientific information on vanadium.
[03:46:23.440 --> 03:46:27.440]  Apparently they are reporting extremely high levels of vanadium,
[03:46:27.440 --> 03:46:29.440]  because they're drilling so deep, folks.
[03:46:29.440 --> 03:46:34.440]  And upper management is getting upset because they do not have any valid research information
[03:46:34.440 --> 03:46:36.440]  on exposure of vanadium in the Gulf.
[03:46:36.440 --> 03:46:43.440]  Previously, there's been a small study done in 2006 that measures small amounts of vanadium being released.
[03:46:43.440 --> 03:46:44.440]  Vanadium is highly toxic.
[03:46:44.440 --> 03:46:45.440]  Please report on this.
[03:46:45.440 --> 03:46:49.440]  You might get EPA consultant to call in.
[03:46:49.440 --> 03:46:52.440]  My friend will not give me the document.
[03:46:52.440 --> 03:46:55.440]  Guys, do a search, because I bet some of this is leaked.
[03:46:55.440 --> 03:46:57.440]  Vanadium being released in the Gulf.
[03:46:57.440 --> 03:47:00.440]  Lindsay Williams, did you hear anything about vanadium?
[03:47:00.440 --> 03:47:03.440]  No. Vanadium was not mentioned in any of my conversations.
[03:47:03.440 --> 03:47:08.440]  But, Alex, the way that this thing is progressing so rapidly from day to day,
[03:47:08.440 --> 03:47:15.440]  I will probably be making updates weekly on this as I contact my sources in what's happening.
[03:47:15.440 --> 03:47:17.440]  And I will be glad to ask them about vanadium.
[03:47:17.440 --> 03:47:22.440]  And I'm glad to hear you're also putting together an emergency DVD report that we'll talk about in the next segment.
[03:47:22.440 --> 03:47:26.440]  I want to jam in a few more calls, but you'll be with us for 30 minutes into the next hour.
[03:47:26.440 --> 03:47:29.440]  And we'll do that same procedure from yesterday, but this time we'll take your calls,
[03:47:29.440 --> 03:47:35.440]  where I give out the number here at my office for those that are patiently holding,
[03:47:35.440 --> 03:47:37.440]  so you can be with us in the overdrive.
[03:47:37.440 --> 03:47:42.440]  The only way to listen there will be infowars.com on the audio streams and prisonplanet.tv,
[03:47:42.440 --> 03:47:44.440]  or prisonplanet.tv members.
[03:47:44.440 --> 03:47:53.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to, we've got a bunch of calls here.
[03:47:53.440 --> 03:47:59.440]  In fact, we've got an anonymous caller here who says he was a contractor for BP during this thing.
[03:47:59.440 --> 03:48:01.440]  He says he's seen all kinds of insanity.
[03:48:01.440 --> 03:48:05.440]  Which caller is that? Which caller is anonymous in LA?
[03:48:05.440 --> 03:48:07.440]  Or, yes, that's Louisiana.
[03:48:07.440 --> 03:48:12.440]  Genesis, which caller is that?
[03:48:12.440 --> 03:48:14.440]  I just call them number two.
[03:48:14.440 --> 03:48:19.440]  Okay, sure. Anonymous, that's fine. We can just make one up.
[03:48:19.440 --> 03:48:22.440]  I've got to know what line they're on to be able to say go to them.
[03:48:22.440 --> 03:48:26.440]  Yeah, let's go to that anonymous caller. Anonymous caller, you're on the air.
[03:48:26.440 --> 03:48:29.440]  Is it Los Angeles or Louisiana you're calling in from?
[03:48:29.440 --> 03:48:31.440]  I was in Louisiana.
[03:48:31.440 --> 03:48:32.440]  Okay, what did you see?
[03:48:32.440 --> 03:48:37.440]  Okay, the information may not be as good as what you just had there,
[03:48:37.440 --> 03:48:41.440]  but I can just tell you some of the things that I saw.
[03:48:41.440 --> 03:48:45.440]  I know that they have the timeline for the explosion,
[03:48:45.440 --> 03:48:50.440]  and I know that the first name that was up on there was work being done by Hallibur.
[03:48:50.440 --> 03:48:54.440]  Within 20 hours after they were injecting minerals into the well,
[03:48:54.440 --> 03:48:58.440]  they almost immediately started having gas problems,
[03:48:58.440 --> 03:49:02.440]  and it was within 20 hours later that the explosion occurred.
[03:49:02.440 --> 03:49:06.440]  And as it was explained to me by people who do this for a living,
[03:49:06.440 --> 03:49:11.440]  they said that they have standard procedures for venting and handling of all this,
[03:49:11.440 --> 03:49:16.440]  and it was the first time ever in history that all three safety measures failed.
[03:49:16.440 --> 03:49:20.440]  And that was, although I'm not the one who does this for a living,
[03:49:20.440 --> 03:49:24.440]  that was what was explained to me by the people who do do it for a living.
[03:49:24.440 --> 03:49:27.440]  So you're a separate contractor that was working in and around this?
[03:49:27.440 --> 03:49:29.440]  Yes.
[03:49:29.440 --> 03:49:32.440]  But that sounds like that meshes with what Lindsey's saying.
[03:49:32.440 --> 03:49:37.440]  We had petroleum geologist earlier on who said, yes, it looks like mega record pressure.
[03:49:37.440 --> 03:49:42.440]  I mean, what's a normal high pressure well, Lindsey Williams?
[03:49:42.440 --> 03:49:46.440]  A crude oil bay oil came up at 1,500 pounds per square inch,
[03:49:46.440 --> 03:49:49.440]  and they considered that to be a pretty good oil pressure.
[03:49:49.440 --> 03:49:56.440]  To get 20,000 to 70,000 pounds per square inch would blow anything that any oil company
[03:49:56.440 --> 03:50:01.440]  or any human being has ever developed on the face of the earth.
[03:50:01.440 --> 03:50:03.440]  Okay.
[03:50:03.440 --> 03:50:10.440]  And my involvement on that end of things was more towards the cleanup end of things.
[03:50:10.440 --> 03:50:14.440]  And just to give a couple of examples of some of the things I saw,
[03:50:14.440 --> 03:50:20.440]  I know they were ready to deploy about 25,000 linear feet of boom.
[03:50:20.440 --> 03:50:24.440]  The National Guard came and said, no, we have to count it.
[03:50:24.440 --> 03:50:26.440]  And they moved it from boat to boat.
[03:50:26.440 --> 03:50:30.440]  And five days in which that boom could have been deployed,
[03:50:30.440 --> 03:50:33.440]  they later they came back and after five days,
[03:50:33.440 --> 03:50:35.440]  that boom could have been completely deployed.
[03:50:35.440 --> 03:50:40.440]  Instead, they sat and counted it and then they brought it back after moving it from boat to boat.
[03:50:40.440 --> 03:50:42.440]  Yeah, it's like weird. It's like New Orleans.
[03:50:42.440 --> 03:50:44.440]  They said, we got all this food and water stacked up.
[03:50:44.440 --> 03:50:46.440]  You can't have it and you can't walk out over the highway.
[03:50:46.440 --> 03:50:48.440]  We're going to machine gun you.
[03:50:48.440 --> 03:50:49.440]  We're government. We're God.
[03:50:49.440 --> 03:50:51.440]  What else did you see?
[03:50:51.440 --> 03:50:59.440]  Well, I do know that another explanation I had was the oil could have been hit.
[03:50:59.440 --> 03:51:01.440]  Stay there. Stay there.
[03:51:01.440 --> 03:51:03.440]  Don't answer it.
[03:51:03.440 --> 03:51:05.440]  If fear strikes your heart when the phone rings,
[03:51:05.440 --> 03:51:07.440]  knowing it may be another bill collector,
[03:51:07.440 --> 03:51:10.440]  it's time for you to call zero debt in 90 days.
[03:51:10.440 --> 03:51:13.440]  800-477-9256.
[03:51:13.440 --> 03:51:16.440]  Settlements, bankruptcy and attorneys are not the answer
[03:51:16.440 --> 03:51:19.440]  and may end up costing you up to 10 times more than necessary.
[03:51:19.440 --> 03:51:21.440]  Listen, if you're already in debt,
[03:51:21.440 --> 03:51:23.440]  does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?
[03:51:23.440 --> 03:51:26.440]  Zero debt in 90 days gets you out of debt in 90 days,
[03:51:26.440 --> 03:51:29.440]  guaranteed without a payment plan and without attorneys
[03:51:29.440 --> 03:51:31.440]  or going to court.
[03:51:31.440 --> 03:51:33.440]  Get the fastest relief from debt on the planet
[03:51:33.440 --> 03:51:36.440]  when you call 800-477-9256.
[03:51:36.440 --> 03:51:38.440]  If you have debt with the IRS, credit cards,
[03:51:38.440 --> 03:51:40.440]  student loans or a foreclosure,
[03:51:40.440 --> 03:51:42.440]  we can help at zero debt in 90 days
[03:51:42.440 --> 03:51:44.440]  and we are the only organization
[03:51:44.440 --> 03:51:46.440]  to provide written guarantees on the results.

[03:51:56.440 --> 03:52:00.440]  That's 800-477-9256.
[03:52:00.440 --> 03:52:04.440]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:52:04.440 --> 03:52:06.440]  tyranny is here.
[03:52:06.440 --> 03:52:09.440]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:09.440 --> 03:52:12.440]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:12.440 --> 03:52:14.440]  The United States is now recognized globally
[03:52:14.440 --> 03:52:17.440]  as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[03:52:17.440 --> 03:52:20.440]  This film conclusively proves the existence
[03:52:20.440 --> 03:52:24.440]  of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:24.440 --> 03:52:27.440]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[03:52:27.440 --> 03:52:30.440]  has established an old powerful shadow state.
[03:52:30.440 --> 03:52:33.440]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths
[03:52:33.440 --> 03:52:35.440]  to which our republic has fallen.
[03:52:35.440 --> 03:52:39.440]  Repair to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:39.440 --> 03:52:42.440]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[03:52:42.440 --> 03:52:45.440]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:52:45.440 --> 03:52:48.440]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:52:48.440 --> 03:52:50.440]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:52:50.440 --> 03:52:52.440]  It's here.

[03:52:59.440 --> 03:53:03.440]  You've seen our SinoFresh banner on the GCN website.
[03:53:03.440 --> 03:53:05.440]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[03:53:05.440 --> 03:53:08.440]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[03:53:08.440 --> 03:53:10.440]  Are you waiting for a SinoFresh discount?
[03:53:10.440 --> 03:53:12.440]  Okay, here it comes.
[03:53:12.440 --> 03:53:13.440]  But first, the facts.
[03:53:13.440 --> 03:53:15.440]  67 other products merely treat symptoms
[03:53:15.440 --> 03:53:17.440]  and not the cause of sinus problems.
[03:53:17.440 --> 03:53:20.440]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress
[03:53:20.440 --> 03:53:21.440]  just like you.
[03:53:21.440 --> 03:53:23.440]  But now many are finding relief with the only
[03:53:23.440 --> 03:53:25.440]  patent protected homeopathic nasal product

[03:53:39.440 --> 03:53:44.440]  Just call 888-906-3636 and mention GCN for a $2 discount.
[03:53:44.440 --> 03:53:47.440]  But hurry, this offer is only for the first 1,000 customers.

[03:53:52.440 --> 03:53:55.440]  Call right now for $2 off per bottle.
[03:53:55.440 --> 03:53:56.440]  Mention GCN.

[03:53:58.440 --> 03:53:59.440]  It works.
[03:53:59.440 --> 03:54:18.440]  You know, we're talking about really heavy subjects here.
[03:54:18.440 --> 03:54:20.440]  We're going into overdrive in the next hour
[03:54:20.440 --> 03:54:25.440]  for Gary, John, Matt, Mike, everybody else.
[03:54:25.440 --> 03:54:28.440]  But first those callers, we're going to go to your calls
[03:54:28.440 --> 03:54:30.440]  this time with Lindsay Williams next hour.
[03:54:30.440 --> 03:54:32.440]  Yesterday I said we're going into overdrive and never got to the callers,
[03:54:32.440 --> 03:54:33.440]  but today we will.
[03:54:33.440 --> 03:54:41.440]  888-201-2244, 888-201-2244 is the number in my studio in Austin
[03:54:41.440 --> 03:54:44.440]  that we give out when we go into overdrive and on the Sunday show.
[03:54:44.440 --> 03:54:46.440]  888-201-2244.
[03:54:46.440 --> 03:54:50.440]  On a separate issue, before we go back to Lindsay Williams,
[03:54:50.440 --> 03:54:52.440]  yeah, this is how we fund our operation.
[03:54:52.440 --> 03:54:55.440]  And if we can't have a website, if we can't have a shopping cart,
[03:54:55.440 --> 03:54:59.440]  if we can't have a Yahoo shopping cart and another shopping cart
[03:54:59.440 --> 03:55:02.440]  we just launched in our eBay store,
[03:55:02.440 --> 03:55:06.440]  we might sell four or five things on a day trying to fund this operation,
[03:55:06.440 --> 03:55:08.440]  then we can't continue.
[03:55:08.440 --> 03:55:11.440]  Or we'll have to go to straight-up donations.
[03:55:11.440 --> 03:55:14.440]  Right as we're reaching all these millions of people
[03:55:14.440 --> 03:55:16.440]  and we're hitting censorship everywhere.
[03:55:16.440 --> 03:55:19.440]  I've been selling this t-shirt for eight years.
[03:55:19.440 --> 03:55:22.440]  It's one of the first t-shirts we offered.
[03:55:22.440 --> 03:55:25.440]  Now, actually, this is the first t-shirt we offered.
[03:55:25.440 --> 03:55:27.440]  It's still a best-seller.
[03:55:27.440 --> 03:55:28.440]  Mass murderers agree.
[03:55:28.440 --> 03:55:29.440]  Gun control works.
[03:55:29.440 --> 03:55:31.440]  Infowars.com.
[03:55:31.440 --> 03:55:33.440]  And on the back, it says,
[03:55:33.440 --> 03:55:35.440]  politicians love disarmed peasants.
[03:55:35.440 --> 03:55:38.440]  Infowars.com.
[03:55:38.440 --> 03:55:42.440]  Now, we were selling this on eBay, I think for $10.
[03:55:42.440 --> 03:55:47.440]  Same thing it is on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[03:55:47.440 --> 03:55:49.440]  We basically make about $5.
[03:55:49.440 --> 03:55:52.440]  We're so evil trying to fund ourselves here.
[03:55:52.440 --> 03:55:55.440]  And eBay sent us a letter saying,
[03:55:55.440 --> 03:55:58.440]  you have been removed for hateful or discriminatory activity,
[03:55:58.440 --> 03:56:01.440]  and one more time in your eBay account is banned.
[03:56:01.440 --> 03:56:05.440]  For saying, Hitler is bad.
[03:56:05.440 --> 03:56:09.440]  This is like France, where you can't sell World War II memorabilia now.
[03:56:09.440 --> 03:56:12.440]  First, it was Nazi, now it's British, now it's American,
[03:56:12.440 --> 03:56:15.440]  because any of it might be Nazi-related.
[03:56:15.440 --> 03:56:17.440]  We're saying Hitler's bad.
[03:56:17.440 --> 03:56:20.440]  Mass murderers agree.
[03:56:20.440 --> 03:56:25.440]  Gun control works with a picture of Mao, Stalin, and Hitler.
[03:56:25.440 --> 03:56:28.440]  Now, since I have mainstream news today that at veteran cemeteries,
[03:56:28.440 --> 03:56:33.440]  they're putting up Mao, excuse me, Stalin statues,
[03:56:33.440 --> 03:56:36.440]  maybe that's what this is really all about.
[03:56:36.440 --> 03:56:38.440]  Maybe I'm not in trouble because they don't tell us
[03:56:38.440 --> 03:56:40.440]  for the Hitler saying he's bad.
[03:56:40.440 --> 03:56:44.440]  Maybe we're not in trouble just because it's Hitler
[03:56:44.440 --> 03:56:49.440]  and they can't read and see that we're criticizing Hitler.
[03:56:49.440 --> 03:56:53.440]  Maybe it's that we're criticizing Mao or Stalin,
[03:56:53.440 --> 03:56:55.440]  because they're so popular now in the U.S.
[03:56:55.440 --> 03:56:58.440]  and have toy stores in it for Mao and restaurants,
[03:56:58.440 --> 03:57:01.440]  and Stalin's a great guy and college kids wear shirts of him.
[03:57:01.440 --> 03:57:03.440]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[03:57:03.440 --> 03:57:07.440]  Now, the issue is that's why I'm for Nazis having their free speech,
[03:57:07.440 --> 03:57:09.440]  because you take the Nazis free speech
[03:57:09.440 --> 03:57:12.440]  or you take the Mexican supremacist free speech
[03:57:12.440 --> 03:57:15.440]  then you're going to lose your free speech.
[03:57:15.440 --> 03:57:17.440]  And that's how this works.
[03:57:17.440 --> 03:57:20.440]  I now cannot criticize Hitler.
[03:57:20.440 --> 03:57:24.440]  We're going to do an article about this at infowars.com today,
[03:57:24.440 --> 03:57:27.440]  a little blurb with a copy of the eBay letter about,
[03:57:27.440 --> 03:57:30.440]  we do this one more time.
[03:57:30.440 --> 03:57:33.440]  Images depicting high-ranking Nazi officers are not permitted
[03:57:33.440 --> 03:57:35.440]  to be sold on the site.
[03:57:35.440 --> 03:57:38.440]  Please do not relist them.
[03:57:38.440 --> 03:57:42.440]  And it goes on.
[03:57:42.440 --> 03:57:44.440]  I mean, this is just insane.
[03:57:44.440 --> 03:57:49.440]  So there's your tyranny, infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:57:49.440 --> 03:57:51.440]  Now, we're going to plug in more in Overdrive,
[03:57:51.440 --> 03:57:53.440]  because I've got to prompt you to do it,
[03:57:53.440 --> 03:57:57.440]  but I want people to get the new special DVD report you made last week
[03:57:57.440 --> 03:57:59.440]  that just came out about this new Intel.
[03:57:59.440 --> 03:58:02.440]  Give folks quickly, Lindsay, the number for people to get the new DVD
[03:58:02.440 --> 03:58:06.440]  that breaks down this Intel you've got on the oil spill.
[03:58:06.440 --> 03:58:08.440]  Produced it on yesterday.
[03:58:08.440 --> 03:58:16.440]  Please call 888-799-6111,
[03:58:16.440 --> 03:58:20.440]  or go on the web to prophecyclub.com.
[03:58:20.440 --> 03:58:25.440]  B-R-O-B-H-E-C-Y-C-L-U-B.com.
[03:58:25.440 --> 03:58:27.440]  Prophecyclub.com.
[03:58:27.440 --> 03:58:32.440]  888-799-6111.
[03:58:32.440 --> 03:58:34.440]  Okay, Lindsay, we've got to go to break for one minute.
[03:58:34.440 --> 03:58:36.440]  We're back in commercial free Overdrive
[03:58:36.440 --> 03:58:39.440]  on the InternetStreams, infowars.com and prismplanet.tv.
[03:58:39.440 --> 03:58:41.440]  You've got to go there.
[03:58:41.440 --> 03:58:45.440]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:45.440 --> 03:58:50.440]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[03:58:50.440 --> 03:58:54.440]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:58:54.440 --> 03:58:57.440]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm,
[03:58:57.440 --> 03:58:59.440]  how much ammunition do you want?
[03:58:59.440 --> 03:59:02.440]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom
[03:59:02.440 --> 03:59:04.440]  and the lives of your loved ones.
[03:59:04.440 --> 03:59:06.440]  Food is your only ammunition.
[03:59:06.440 --> 03:59:08.440]  How much do you want? When do you want it?
[03:59:08.440 --> 03:59:10.440]  Now or after the battle starts.
[03:59:10.440 --> 03:59:11.440]  When will you need it?
[03:59:11.440 --> 03:59:13.440]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:59:13.440 --> 03:59:15.440]  Will there be any food?
[03:59:15.440 --> 03:59:16.440]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:59:16.440 --> 03:59:19.440]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[03:59:19.440 --> 03:59:21.440]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:59:21.440 --> 03:59:25.440]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:59:25.440 --> 03:59:29.440]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:59:29.440 --> 03:59:31.440]  How much will you need? We don't know.
[03:59:31.440 --> 03:59:33.440]  How much do you want? All you can get.
[03:59:33.440 --> 03:59:34.440]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:59:34.440 --> 03:59:37.440]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:59:37.440 --> 03:59:41.440]  Call 1-800-409-5633
[03:59:41.440 --> 03:59:45.440]  or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[03:59:45.440 --> 04:00:02.440]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[04:00:15.440 --> 04:00:36.440]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are into our number overdrive.
[04:00:36.440 --> 04:00:38.440]  Into our fifth hour today.
[04:00:38.440 --> 04:00:40.440]  I did five hours and 15 minutes yesterday.
[04:00:40.440 --> 04:00:42.440]  We're only going to do about 30 more today
[04:00:42.440 --> 04:00:45.440]  and take a few of the callers that are left over from the live transmissions
[04:00:45.440 --> 04:00:48.440]  on the AM and FM, XM, everything else.
[04:00:48.440 --> 04:00:51.440]  Pastor Lindsey Williams with his inside intel with his former
[04:00:51.440 --> 04:00:56.440]  Big Three Oil Company executive has given him so many key insights before.
[04:00:56.440 --> 04:00:59.440]  Lindsey, you went over the fact that they are looking at using a nuke.
[04:00:59.440 --> 04:01:03.440]  The fact that you're saying it's 20,000 to 70,000 pressure
[04:01:03.440 --> 04:01:08.440]  that they went into some type of magma chamber, a volcano.
[04:01:08.440 --> 04:01:14.440]  I mean, they're drilling down to the ends of the crust close to the mantle.
[04:01:14.440 --> 04:01:18.440]  And we know they have these bathaliffs and other things that are forming.
[04:01:18.440 --> 04:01:20.440]  So you're very, very serious.
[04:01:20.440 --> 04:01:24.440]  And we're seeing this kind of being dribbled out now.
[04:01:24.440 --> 04:01:27.440]  We've seen the propaganda of, oh, they fixed the leak over and over again
[04:01:27.440 --> 04:01:31.440]  to give false hope and oh, there's only a few thousand gallons
[04:01:31.440 --> 04:01:34.440]  and 50,000 and 100,000 and 200,000.
[04:01:34.440 --> 04:01:36.440]  Now they say it's a half million.
[04:01:36.440 --> 04:01:38.440]  Now they're saying they're underestimating that.
[04:01:38.440 --> 04:01:42.440]  You're saying your oil company sources are saying what,
[04:01:42.440 --> 04:01:44.440]  four to five million gallons a day?
[04:01:44.440 --> 04:01:47.440]  Yes, but I'm quite sure that they were being very conservative
[04:01:47.440 --> 04:01:49.440]  because they knew I was going to quote them.
[04:01:49.440 --> 04:01:55.440]  And so you can put it very much above that.
[04:01:55.440 --> 04:01:58.440]  Okay, so let's run through recapping what you've already broke
[04:01:58.440 --> 04:02:02.440]  and the other news you didn't have the time to get to while I was taking calls.
[04:02:02.440 --> 04:02:07.440]  Okay, first of all, I want to touch on a subject that you just casually mentioned
[04:02:07.440 --> 04:02:08.440]  at the beginning of your program.
[04:02:08.440 --> 04:02:12.440]  You said that Goldman Sachs sold much of that BP stock,
[04:02:12.440 --> 04:02:17.440]  only a few days just prior to the Gulf oil gusher.
[04:02:17.440 --> 04:02:23.440]  And that BP's president sold one third of his stocks just prior to that.
[04:02:23.440 --> 04:02:25.440]  Yeah, BP sold 44%. He sold a third.
[04:02:25.440 --> 04:02:28.440]  Turns out the Goldman Sachs chairman of international
[04:02:28.440 --> 04:02:31.440]  was also the chairman of BP but got out a month before.
[04:02:31.440 --> 04:02:35.440]  I'm so glad that you mentioned this because it gives me an opportunity to say it.
[04:02:35.440 --> 04:02:37.440]  Otherwise, I wouldn't have dared do it.
[04:02:37.440 --> 04:02:40.440]  I lived with these people for three years.
[04:02:40.440 --> 04:02:46.440]  The average person has not the slightest idea as to the mind and set of the elite.
[04:02:46.440 --> 04:02:51.440]  I have written three books attempting to tell people how these people think.
[04:02:51.440 --> 04:02:54.440]  The elite are a part of the occult.
[04:02:54.440 --> 04:02:56.440]  Are you catching me folks?
[04:02:56.440 --> 04:03:00.440]  Now, keep in mind, I've been a minister of the gospel, the Bible
[04:03:00.440 --> 04:03:02.440]  for 50 years.
[04:03:02.440 --> 04:03:05.440]  I lived with these elite for three years.
[04:03:05.440 --> 04:03:08.440]  They are a part of the occult.
[04:03:08.440 --> 04:03:12.440]  You wonder why did Goldman Sachs sell this stock so many days ahead of time?
[04:03:12.440 --> 04:03:15.440]  Their occultist connections told them to.
[04:03:15.440 --> 04:03:19.440]  You've got to understand that we're dealing with a spiritual warfare here
[04:03:19.440 --> 04:03:23.440]  that is so far beyond the imagination of the average person.
[04:03:23.440 --> 04:03:27.440]  Unless you live with them, you couldn't understand why BP,
[04:03:27.440 --> 04:03:31.440]  President, would sell this amount of stock.
[04:03:31.440 --> 04:03:34.440]  It wasn't that he knew this thing was going to blow.
[04:03:34.440 --> 04:03:39.440]  It's that his occultic connections, and Alex, you have even made a video on the occult.
[04:03:39.440 --> 04:03:41.440]  I know it was...
[04:03:41.440 --> 04:03:43.440]  You went out to California and...
[04:03:43.440 --> 04:03:46.440]  Yeah, Bohemian Grove. I mean, it's even admitted that...
[04:03:46.440 --> 04:03:49.440]  These people are a part of the occult.
[04:03:49.440 --> 04:03:52.440]  And as a result, they knew in advance what to do,
[04:03:52.440 --> 04:03:55.440]  not because they knew this thing was going to blow,
[04:03:55.440 --> 04:03:58.440]  the occultic connections that told them so.
[04:03:58.440 --> 04:04:01.440]  Well, the word is, and I'm not into the occult,
[04:04:01.440 --> 04:04:04.440]  but I've had people that are into astrology, well-known businessmen here in Austin,
[04:04:04.440 --> 04:04:07.440]  I'm not going to say names that have visited me,
[04:04:07.440 --> 04:04:12.440]  saying that there's going to be catastrophe in the next few months,
[04:04:12.440 --> 04:04:15.440]  and this was before the spill, and there's going to be all this stuff happening,
[04:04:15.440 --> 04:04:18.440]  and it's going to get worse and worse going into July,
[04:04:18.440 --> 04:04:21.440]  because the astrology says it.
[04:04:21.440 --> 04:04:25.440]  And I know that Ronald Reagan made every decision he did down to the minute of a speech
[04:04:25.440 --> 04:04:28.440]  to the color of his tie off of his astrologer,
[04:04:28.440 --> 04:04:30.440]  and I'm not bashing Ronald Reagan,
[04:04:30.440 --> 04:04:33.440]  because when you go to mainstream news about Tony Blair,
[04:04:33.440 --> 04:04:36.440]  he goes all over the world doing these rituals.
[04:04:36.440 --> 04:04:39.440]  Every morning he's possessed by something called the spirit of the light
[04:04:39.440 --> 04:04:41.440]  and flops around on the ground.
[04:04:41.440 --> 04:04:43.440]  So is his wife.
[04:04:43.440 --> 04:04:50.440]  François Mitterrand paid the architect to have 666 pink pieces of glass
[04:04:50.440 --> 04:04:52.440]  to make the Louvre pyramid.
[04:04:52.440 --> 04:04:55.440]  He has publicly said he worships Lucifer,
[04:04:55.440 --> 04:04:59.440]  and yes, they believe that just like George Washington thought,
[04:04:59.440 --> 04:05:03.440]  you know, the God of the Bible was giving him guidance
[04:05:03.440 --> 04:05:07.440]  that these elitists, whether they're psychic or whatever,
[04:05:07.440 --> 04:05:09.440]  and then manifest it through the occult,
[04:05:09.440 --> 04:05:13.440]  they believe they're being guided by their spirit guides.
[04:05:13.440 --> 04:05:15.440]  And they are.
[04:05:15.440 --> 04:05:17.440]  You've got to believe they are.
[04:05:17.440 --> 04:05:20.440]  The spirit guide is two gods in this universe.
[04:05:20.440 --> 04:05:23.440]  There's a true living God of the Bible who created all of heaven and earth
[04:05:23.440 --> 04:05:26.440]  and sent his son to die for us on the cross
[04:05:26.440 --> 04:05:29.440]  as a forgiveness and perpetuation of our sins.
[04:05:29.440 --> 04:05:31.440]  Then there is the prince of the power of the air,
[04:05:31.440 --> 04:05:35.440]  the God of this world better known as the average person,
[04:05:35.440 --> 04:05:37.440]  as Lucifer or the devil,
[04:05:37.440 --> 04:05:40.440]  and these people serve that God.
[04:05:42.440 --> 04:05:44.440]  Well, I tell you, you know,
[04:05:44.440 --> 04:05:49.440]  they sure believe they're getting this goblin guidance.
[04:05:49.440 --> 04:05:53.440]  All I know is, is that every one of these creatures
[04:05:53.440 --> 04:05:55.440]  started dumping their stock at record levels
[04:05:55.440 --> 04:05:57.440]  right before this happened, Lindsey.
[04:05:57.440 --> 04:06:02.440]  Well, let me assure you that from every source that I had talked with
[04:06:02.440 --> 04:06:06.440]  that what happened in the Gulf of Mexico was positively an accident.
[04:06:06.440 --> 04:06:08.440]  It was not planned.
[04:06:08.440 --> 04:06:10.440]  It is not a part of any conspiracy.
[04:06:10.440 --> 04:06:13.440]  Well, if their devils could tell them this was going to happen
[04:06:13.440 --> 04:06:16.440]  to whatever interdimensional creatures they're communicating with,
[04:06:16.440 --> 04:06:18.440]  that's what they believe they're doing.
[04:06:18.440 --> 04:06:21.440]  I mean, even if it's not true, folks, that's what they believe.
[04:06:21.440 --> 04:06:23.440]  I mean, that's just raw research.
[04:06:23.440 --> 04:06:24.440]  I keep running into that.
[04:06:24.440 --> 04:06:26.440]  That's what they're really into.
[04:06:26.440 --> 04:06:29.440]  Even if they've got these connections,
[04:06:29.440 --> 04:06:34.440]  why couldn't the creatures tell them that the oil spill was coming?
[04:06:34.440 --> 04:06:37.440]  All right, that gets me down to my next point.
[04:06:37.440 --> 04:06:39.440]  And I'm glad you led into it perfectly, Alex.
[04:06:39.440 --> 04:06:41.440]  We're thinking exactly alike.
[04:06:41.440 --> 04:06:46.440]  So after I talked with my Mr. X with the book Energy Non-Crisis,
[04:06:46.440 --> 04:06:50.440]  after I had communicated with a number of other oil people,
[04:06:50.440 --> 04:06:54.440]  and have you noticed, Alex, that every person who has called into your show today
[04:06:54.440 --> 04:06:57.440]  has agreed with what this Mr. X told me?
[04:06:57.440 --> 04:06:58.440]  Yes.
[04:06:58.440 --> 04:07:02.440]  Folks, I do not take credit for any of this.
[04:07:02.440 --> 04:07:06.440]  I must say emphatically that it is by the providence of God
[04:07:06.440 --> 04:07:10.440]  that I was ever allowed to be the chaplain on the trans-elastic oil pipeline
[04:07:10.440 --> 04:07:13.440]  and give an executive status and sat in the board meetings.
[04:07:13.440 --> 04:07:16.440]  And I do not take credit for the things I'm saying today.
[04:07:16.440 --> 04:07:21.440]  I knew nothing about such things as that cap that was on the well,
[04:07:21.440 --> 04:07:23.440]  the failsafe valve, and all this lingo.
[04:07:23.440 --> 04:07:27.440]  I didn't even recognize it until this individual told me.
[04:07:27.440 --> 04:07:30.440]  And the fact that they went into a strata, please,
[04:07:30.440 --> 04:07:35.440]  use the proper words because the oil people will laugh at us if we don't.
[04:07:35.440 --> 04:07:40.440]  They went into a strata of oil that is so phenomenal
[04:07:40.440 --> 04:07:45.440]  that no company, including the Russians, have ever drilled into it before.
[04:07:45.440 --> 04:07:49.440]  Now, keeping all of this in mind, after I had talked with these people about this,
[04:07:49.440 --> 04:07:56.440]  I said, okay, what are you going, how does this fit in?
[04:07:56.440 --> 04:08:02.440]  I had to be very vague and yet try to get an answer out of Alex.
[04:08:02.440 --> 04:08:05.440]  I stand here shuddering almost.
[04:08:05.440 --> 04:08:09.440]  The elite, even though they did not create this,
[04:08:09.440 --> 04:08:13.440]  even though they did not know it was going to happen except by the occultic words,
[04:08:13.440 --> 04:08:22.440]  the elite planned to use this disaster to accomplish their timeline of 2010 and 2012
[04:08:22.440 --> 04:08:28.440]  exactly as was given to me by the 87-year-old elitist.
[04:08:28.440 --> 04:08:32.440]  And I appeared on your show, I gave every bit of it.
[04:08:32.440 --> 04:08:36.440]  It's on my six DVD set, eight hours of DVD doing,
[04:08:36.440 --> 04:08:41.440]  and they have told me that they are going to use this Gulf scenario
[04:08:41.440 --> 04:08:46.440]  as a method of accomplishing their timeline for 2010 and 2012
[04:08:46.440 --> 04:08:52.440]  exactly as they told me they were going to do it and folks, they will.
[04:08:52.440 --> 04:08:54.440]  You have it coming.
[04:08:54.440 --> 04:09:01.440]  My opinion from what I have heard from Mr. X and my BP informants,
[04:09:01.440 --> 04:09:05.440]  you are not going to see this world-capped anytime soon.
[04:09:05.440 --> 04:09:08.440]  Alex, I'm making a prediction here.
[04:09:08.440 --> 04:09:15.440]  I think, I think that you probably are going to be calling me every few weeks for an update
[04:09:15.440 --> 04:09:19.440]  and I'm going to be calling Mr. X every so many days for an update
[04:09:19.440 --> 04:09:26.440]  because we are going to see an event of such epic proportion
[04:09:26.440 --> 04:09:32.440]  that it is going to devastate much of the finances and the people of the United States of America
[04:09:32.440 --> 04:09:36.440]  and will get Mr. Obama's programs through exactly like he wants them
[04:09:36.440 --> 04:09:42.440]  and the elite have already told me that everything they gave me a year and a half ago
[04:09:42.440 --> 04:09:47.440]  that they are going to use this as one of the major methods now that it's happened
[04:09:47.440 --> 04:09:52.440]  of getting that 2012 timeline done, Alex.
[04:09:52.440 --> 04:09:57.440]  Well, we are looking at a lot of feed right now of the oil gusher
[04:09:57.440 --> 04:10:04.440]  and it is in that incredible pressure that would crush any submarine we've got that's manned.
[04:10:04.440 --> 04:10:07.440]  They've got some submersibles that aren't manned that can go down that far
[04:10:07.440 --> 04:10:10.440]  obviously because they are down there working on it
[04:10:10.440 --> 04:10:16.440]  but it is just blasting, blasting out of the hole there
[04:10:16.440 --> 04:10:19.440]  and it's so hard to work in 5,000 feet of water.
[04:10:19.440 --> 04:10:24.440]  We looked up this email about Vanadium, this highly toxic chemical
[04:10:24.440 --> 04:10:29.440]  and sure enough I've got Huffington Post, I've got major oil sites
[04:10:29.440 --> 04:10:31.440]  that this is composited from.
[04:10:31.440 --> 04:10:36.440]  It says, in addition to hydrocarbons, crude oil has organic compounds
[04:10:36.440 --> 04:10:40.440]  that contain nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen as well as carbon and hydrogen.
[04:10:40.440 --> 04:10:43.440]  It also contains trace mineral salts and metals.
[04:10:43.440 --> 04:10:48.440]  The most common metal is nickel, vanadium, iron, copper
[04:10:48.440 --> 04:10:54.440]  but can also include very small amounts of metals like uranium, arsenic and mercury.
[04:10:54.440 --> 04:10:59.440]  This strata of oil that we are talking about could just be amazing
[04:10:59.440 --> 04:11:03.440]  but I understand when they are going for oil they call the different layers
[04:11:03.440 --> 04:11:06.440]  they are hitting different strata of oil and natural gas,
[04:11:06.440 --> 04:11:10.440]  different gas sands and a different strata of the rock
[04:11:10.440 --> 04:11:13.440]  but what I'm saying is, if they are going down this deep
[04:11:13.440 --> 04:11:16.440]  we know that these magma chambers can come up right to the surface.
[04:11:16.440 --> 04:11:22.440]  That's what a volcano is and that a lot of people think they may have drilled down into the magma
[04:11:22.440 --> 04:11:27.440]  or something that's in between that because of how unusual this is
[04:11:27.440 --> 04:11:30.440]  so that's the point I'm making about that, Lindsay.
[04:11:30.440 --> 04:11:34.440]  The only thing that I was assured of is that they have drilled into a strata
[04:11:34.440 --> 04:11:39.440]  that more than likely no other human being has ever gone into in the history of the world.
[04:11:39.440 --> 04:11:43.440]  It is what is called a super deep well and because of it,
[04:11:43.440 --> 04:11:45.440]  they hit pressures that even Russia didn't.
[04:11:45.440 --> 04:11:50.440]  This is what I'm assured of by my involvement as a result of that
[04:11:50.440 --> 04:11:56.440]  to stop this thing by natural methods that have already been devised will be an impossibility.
[04:11:56.440 --> 04:12:01.440]  Nuke is probably the only way to do it and I think everybody is geared to death.
[04:12:01.440 --> 04:12:04.440]  But they could blow out the whole thing and the pressure could be so powerful
[04:12:04.440 --> 04:12:08.440]  that it just goes through the cracks and then you've got an even bigger mess
[04:12:08.440 --> 04:12:15.440]  and then you've got some two mile wide cracked mishmash within a never ends.
[04:12:15.440 --> 04:12:17.440]  Well, you cracked that strata further.
[04:12:17.440 --> 04:12:24.440]  They drilled into it with a pipe and 25 to 30,000 feet down plus 5,000 feet of water.
[04:12:24.440 --> 04:12:29.440]  Now, when they drilled into that, they have already gone into it
[04:12:29.440 --> 04:12:34.440]  but you go down with a nuke and crack it further
[04:12:34.440 --> 04:12:38.440]  and there's no impossibility to ever, in the history of the world,
[04:12:38.440 --> 04:12:41.440]  to fill that back up until the day that it is emptied itself.
[04:12:41.440 --> 04:12:43.440]  That would be so catastrophic you don't need more thinking about it.
[04:12:43.440 --> 04:12:48.440]  And the abiotic theory is true and all the evidence is beginning to point towards it being true.
[04:12:48.440 --> 04:12:51.440]  More petroleum geologists are saying something's going on.
[04:12:51.440 --> 04:12:52.440]  These wells are replenishing.
[04:12:52.440 --> 04:12:54.440]  Now, this is not finite.
[04:12:54.440 --> 04:12:55.440]  It could be an unlimited.
[04:12:55.440 --> 04:13:00.440]  I mean, the Gulf of Mexico could become known as the Black La Brea Tar Pit
[04:13:00.440 --> 04:13:05.440]  and it could literally destroy the beaches of the planet for hundreds of years.
[04:13:05.440 --> 04:13:10.440]  Alex, a radio talk show host whom I will not mention, called me on yesterday.
[04:13:10.440 --> 04:13:12.440]  He is very well known.
[04:13:12.440 --> 04:13:18.440]  He said, Chaplain, I was supposed to have a person on my program tonight
[04:13:18.440 --> 04:13:25.440]  who is a tourist rep in the Keys, down to which Key West, all for Florida.
[04:13:25.440 --> 04:13:29.440]  And he said, I had scheduled them.
[04:13:29.440 --> 04:13:31.440]  They were going to be on my program tonight.
[04:13:31.440 --> 04:13:32.440]  Can you fill in for them?
[04:13:32.440 --> 04:13:33.440]  I said, no.
[04:13:33.440 --> 04:13:37.440]  I promised Alex that I'd do his show first with this and I kept my word.
[04:13:37.440 --> 04:13:38.440]  I said, why?
[04:13:38.440 --> 04:13:43.440]  He said, they called a few minutes ago, said that they were threatened.
[04:13:43.440 --> 04:13:47.440]  They were told not to appear on my program under any circumstances.
[04:13:47.440 --> 04:13:49.440]  There is a media blackout on this.
[04:13:49.440 --> 04:13:54.440]  I don't know what repercussions you may get for even having this program today.
[04:13:54.440 --> 04:13:58.440]  Some things have been said that could come from nowhere except inside sources.
[04:13:58.440 --> 04:14:02.440]  Even those people who have carved into your program today have given details
[04:14:02.440 --> 04:14:05.440]  but none of them have given intricacies as you've heard.
[04:14:05.440 --> 04:14:06.440]  No, no.
[04:14:06.440 --> 04:14:07.440]  I want to be specific.
[04:14:07.440 --> 04:14:09.440]  I know the oil company executive.
[04:14:09.440 --> 04:14:11.440]  So does Dr. Monte from Separate Research.
[04:14:11.440 --> 04:14:12.440]  He's called him.
[04:14:12.440 --> 04:14:13.440]  I know you're for real.
[04:14:13.440 --> 04:14:16.440]  I mean, I know that you've been exposing this for 30 years
[04:14:16.440 --> 04:14:19.440]  and that you did work with these big oil companies
[04:14:19.440 --> 04:14:22.440]  and that you do have these sources and everything you said makes sense.
[04:14:22.440 --> 04:14:24.440]  Lindsay Williams, I wish you were wrong
[04:14:24.440 --> 04:14:26.440]  and I wish I would have gotten you on earlier
[04:14:26.440 --> 04:14:28.440]  because you've been calling this week.
[04:14:28.440 --> 04:14:33.440]  But just at a subconscious level, I don't want to believe things are bad.
[04:14:33.440 --> 04:14:36.440]  You know, people think I just jumped to conclusions.
[04:14:36.440 --> 04:14:37.440]  I don't.
[04:14:37.440 --> 04:14:41.440]  People were telling me four days ago there's troops all over the Gulf intimidating people
[04:14:41.440 --> 04:14:43.440]  and now more and more it looks like that's true
[04:14:43.440 --> 04:14:45.440]  and they admit there's National Guard everywhere.
[04:14:45.440 --> 04:14:47.440]  And so I guess that's happening.
[04:14:47.440 --> 04:14:50.440]  You know, I mean, when somebody calls me and says there's Marines
[04:14:50.440 --> 04:14:54.440]  300 miles from the border, you know, searching people at checkpoints,
[04:14:54.440 --> 04:14:58.440]  I don't believe it and then I get the state police press release
[04:14:58.440 --> 04:14:59.440]  and photos of it.
[04:14:59.440 --> 04:15:00.440]  It's in the newspaper.
[04:15:00.440 --> 04:15:04.440]  I mean, it's just at a certain point, I can't believe all over the country
[04:15:04.440 --> 04:15:08.440]  they're taking people's homes for $360 unpaid water bills
[04:15:08.440 --> 04:15:11.440]  and $200 unpaid power bills and water bills.
[04:15:11.440 --> 04:15:13.440]  And I've got an article here today.
[04:15:13.440 --> 04:15:18.440]  You know, Star Tribune in jail for being in debt.
[04:15:18.440 --> 04:15:20.440]  It's not a crime to owe money to debtors.
[04:15:20.440 --> 04:15:23.440]  Prisons are abolished in the United States in the 19th century.
[04:15:23.440 --> 04:15:27.440]  People are routinely being thrown into jail for failing to pay debts
[04:15:27.440 --> 04:15:29.440]  to even private corporations.
[04:15:29.440 --> 04:15:32.440]  I mean, there's not even a law they're putting them in jail,
[04:15:32.440 --> 04:15:33.440]  Lindsey Williams.
[04:15:33.440 --> 04:15:35.440]  I mean, you know, I've got articles here.
[04:15:35.440 --> 04:15:39.440]  I mean, I'm finally getting overwhelmed.
[04:15:39.440 --> 04:15:43.440]  I mean, it's finally getting too insane and I don't even,
[04:15:43.440 --> 04:15:46.440]  you know, I guess the Bible says they wear out the saints
[04:15:46.440 --> 04:15:49.440]  with all their, you know, chicanery and their enjoyment of it.
[04:15:49.440 --> 04:15:51.440]  I'm not saying I'm a saint or anything, but you know,
[04:15:51.440 --> 04:15:53.440]  people warn out sometimes.
[04:15:53.440 --> 04:15:56.440]  I know you must feel worn out, you know, 30, 40 years fighting this,
[04:15:56.440 --> 04:15:58.440]  I don't know, 35 years, whatever it is.
[04:15:58.440 --> 04:16:01.440]  And I want to go to a few phone calls here,
[04:16:01.440 --> 04:16:04.440]  but also tell folks how to get that new DVD you've put out on this
[04:16:04.440 --> 04:16:06.440]  so it's all clearly laid out.
[04:16:06.440 --> 04:16:09.440]  But from what you're saying and what appears to be happening,
[04:16:09.440 --> 04:16:12.440]  you know, I mean, the way they won't let the states protect themselves,
[04:16:12.440 --> 04:16:14.440]  so it's worse.
[04:16:14.440 --> 04:16:17.440]  The way they screwed up Katrina and made it as bad as they could
[04:16:17.440 --> 04:16:19.440]  so they could say, oh, look, FEMA needs more power.
[04:16:19.440 --> 04:16:22.440]  Well, Obama now says I'm going to get my carbon tax with this.
[04:16:22.440 --> 04:16:25.440]  The way they're now telling us it may go to Christmas,
[04:16:25.440 --> 04:16:27.440]  then they said it may go for a year.
[04:16:27.440 --> 04:16:29.440]  Now they say it may go for two years.
[04:16:29.440 --> 04:16:33.440]  It looks like they're getting us ready to just say the Gulf of Mexico
[04:16:33.440 --> 04:16:36.440]  is now going to be a black lagoon of toxic waste.
[04:16:36.440 --> 04:16:42.440]  Well, Alex, I have covered what actually has happened
[04:16:42.440 --> 04:16:46.440]  and I have given you documented information.
[04:16:46.440 --> 04:16:49.440]  I have talked about what is happening,
[04:16:49.440 --> 04:16:52.440]  not only what did happen, but what is happening.
[04:16:52.440 --> 04:16:55.440]  Now I'd like to tell you what's going to happen.
[04:16:55.440 --> 04:16:58.440]  And I'll begin with John Hofmeister.
[04:16:58.440 --> 04:17:01.440]  I'm going to back up all of this with names and dates.
[04:17:01.440 --> 04:17:03.440]  I don't dare give this without it.
[04:17:03.440 --> 04:17:07.440]  John Hofmeister is the former president of Shell Oil.
[04:17:07.440 --> 04:17:11.440]  He's the author of a book entitled Why We Hate the Oil Companies.
[04:17:11.440 --> 04:17:13.440]  You can go find this for yourself.
[04:17:13.440 --> 04:17:16.440]  Now, here's what he says.
[04:17:16.440 --> 04:17:24.440]  The BP disaster has raised questions about halting risky domestic oil extraction procedures altogether,
[04:17:24.440 --> 04:17:27.440]  including deep water programs.
[04:17:27.440 --> 04:17:32.440]  Hofmeister, a longtime advocate of more domestic drilling, says,
[04:17:32.440 --> 04:17:36.440]  America simply can't afford to stop drilling.
[04:17:36.440 --> 04:17:48.440]  America's net import of oil has jumped from 58.2% and 27% from 34.8% in 1973.
[04:17:48.440 --> 04:17:50.440]  That's according to the U.S. government.
[04:17:50.440 --> 04:17:52.440]  Now, Hofmeister says,
[04:17:52.440 --> 04:17:57.440]  while we dream about new energy systems decades from now,
[04:17:57.440 --> 04:18:01.440]  the price to consumers will have to pay for things like gasoline,
[04:18:01.440 --> 04:18:09.440]  electric diesel, would just skyrocket if America halted offshore drilling.
[04:18:09.440 --> 04:18:20.440]  Prices could go to a point where fixed income and low-income people are simply taken out of the personal mobility marketplace,
[04:18:20.440 --> 04:18:27.440]  which would be a shock and unnecessary because of our unwillingness to produce domestic resources.
[04:18:27.440 --> 04:18:29.440]  Now, I'm going to give you his prediction.
[04:18:29.440 --> 04:18:32.440]  Here it is, what you're going to be paying for gasoline.
[04:18:32.440 --> 04:18:35.440]  I'm surprised somebody has to ask that so far.
[04:18:35.440 --> 04:18:39.440]  I know it's down at the pump right now, but you haven't seen anything yet.
[04:18:39.440 --> 04:18:42.440]  I'm going to tell you what is John Hofmeister's statement
[04:18:42.440 --> 04:18:46.440]  because you remember the President of the United States of America said just recently
[04:18:46.440 --> 04:18:52.440]  he's going to halt all future permits for offshore drilling.
[04:18:52.440 --> 04:18:54.440]  And here's what Hofmeister says.
[04:18:54.440 --> 04:18:56.440]  You can put it in your book.
[04:18:56.440 --> 04:19:00.440]  Mr. X has told me this will probably happen, and here it is.
[04:19:00.440 --> 04:19:04.440]  People also don't want oil washing on their beaches,
[04:19:04.440 --> 04:19:09.440]  whether it is the Gulf of Mexico, Florida, or maybe the East Coast.
[04:19:09.440 --> 04:19:11.440]  I'll go into that in a moment.
[04:19:11.440 --> 04:19:14.440]  Do you think that American public is going to say,
[04:19:14.440 --> 04:19:17.440]  we don't want to drilling offshore anymore?
[04:19:17.440 --> 04:19:19.440]  Well, here's what he says.
[04:19:19.440 --> 04:19:27.440]  He said, if Americans say that, you are going to be accepting $6 to $8 per gallon
[04:19:27.440 --> 04:19:33.440]  at the gas pump as an alternate in the near future.
[04:19:33.440 --> 04:19:39.440]  Folks, you are going to be paying $6 to $8 at the gas pump in the near future.
[04:19:39.440 --> 04:19:42.440]  Well, Lindsay, I saw an AP article yesterday.
[04:19:42.440 --> 04:19:46.440]  I saw an AP article yesterday that interrupt where all the foreign oil companies
[04:19:46.440 --> 04:19:49.440]  and U.S. oil companies that had their rigs out there already drilling.
[04:19:49.440 --> 04:19:53.440]  The headline was oil companies pull up stakes in the Gulf,
[04:19:53.440 --> 04:19:55.440]  and they're all just leaving.
[04:19:55.440 --> 04:19:58.440]  No new exploration, even in areas and international waters.
[04:19:58.440 --> 04:19:59.440]  It's over.
[04:19:59.440 --> 04:20:04.440]  And now Obama's saying he's going to try to stop deep drilling in the United States.
[04:20:04.440 --> 04:20:12.440]  And this is the move to nationalize the oil companies that we're now going to see from this.
[04:20:12.440 --> 04:20:16.440]  And the head of the Department of Transportation two months ago
[04:20:16.440 --> 04:20:20.440]  was in the New York Times saying we are officially anti-car,
[04:20:20.440 --> 04:20:23.440]  and we're going to make you use buses and trains.
[04:20:23.440 --> 04:20:25.440]  So this is their dream.
[04:20:25.440 --> 04:20:31.440]  You are going to be paying $6 to $7 a gallon at the gas pump?
[04:20:31.440 --> 04:20:35.440]  By the way, if you're going on vacation anywhere, go quick.
[04:20:35.440 --> 04:20:37.440]  Don't even wait till the end of the summer.
[04:20:37.440 --> 04:20:42.440]  You are going to be paying $6 to $7 a gallon at the gas pump in the near future.
[04:20:42.440 --> 04:20:45.440]  And that means airline traffic's going to go up?
[04:20:45.440 --> 04:20:47.440]  Airlines will go bankrupt.
[04:20:47.440 --> 04:20:49.440]  There's no way that airlines can stand this.
[04:20:49.440 --> 04:20:52.440]  They'll nationalize the airlines, the government will take them over.
[04:20:52.440 --> 04:20:55.440]  Obama wants to make us a socialistic state,
[04:20:55.440 --> 04:20:59.440]  and he's going to do it because now he has the wherewithal to be able to.
[04:20:59.440 --> 04:21:02.440]  Now, I want to give you the other item, though.
[04:21:02.440 --> 04:21:05.440]  This one is future.
[04:21:05.440 --> 04:21:07.440]  And I have to read this.
[04:21:07.440 --> 04:21:12.440]  The oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may have apocalyptic consequences.
[04:21:12.440 --> 04:21:17.440]  A report of the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources said,
[04:21:17.440 --> 04:21:23.440]  the British Petroleum Oil Spill is threatening the entire eastern half of North American continent
[04:21:23.440 --> 04:21:27.440]  with total destruction, report says.
[04:21:27.440 --> 04:21:30.440]  An ominous report by Russia's Ministry of Natural Resources,
[04:21:30.440 --> 04:21:36.440]  warned of the intending disaster resulting from the British Petroleum Oil and Gas leak
[04:21:36.440 --> 04:21:42.440]  in the Gulf of Mexico, calling it the worst environmental catastrophe in all of human history.
[04:21:42.440 --> 04:21:48.440]  The European Union Times reported, Russian scientists believe BP...
[04:21:48.440 --> 04:21:51.440]  Oh, folks, please write these words down.
[04:21:51.440 --> 04:21:52.440]  I'm going to spell them for you.
[04:21:52.440 --> 04:21:53.440]  Just a moment.
[04:21:53.440 --> 04:22:04.440]  Russian scientists believe BP is pumping millions of gallons of carizite, C-O-R-E-X-I-T-E, 9,500,
[04:22:04.440 --> 04:22:11.440]  a chemical dispersing agent under the Gulf of Mexico waters to hide the full extent of the leak,
[04:22:11.440 --> 04:22:16.440]  now estimated to be over 2.9 million gallons a day.
[04:22:16.440 --> 04:22:25.440]  Experts say carizite 9,500 is a solvent more times more toxic than oil, four times more toxic.
[04:22:25.440 --> 04:22:32.440]  The ancient scientists believe has a 2.61 ppm toxicity level,
[04:22:32.440 --> 04:22:40.440]  and when mixed with the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, its molecules will be able to phase transition.
[04:22:40.440 --> 04:22:45.440]  This transition involves the change of the liquid into a gaseous state,
[04:22:45.440 --> 04:22:47.440]  which can be absorbed by clouds.
[04:22:47.440 --> 04:22:55.440]  The gas will then be released as toxic ornate, leading to unimaginable environmental catastrophe,
[04:22:55.440 --> 04:23:04.440]  destroying all life forms from the bottom of the evolutionary chain to the top.
[04:23:04.440 --> 04:23:05.440]  Alex?
[04:23:05.440 --> 04:23:06.440]  Yes, sir, I'm listening here.
[04:23:06.440 --> 04:23:07.440]  Continue.
[04:23:07.440 --> 04:23:09.440]  Well, what are we going to see?
[04:23:09.440 --> 04:23:13.440]  Yes, they don't contain this thing, and this is a big deal.
[04:23:13.440 --> 04:23:18.440]  I hope tomorrow morning that VPA will be able to get this whole thing.
[04:23:18.440 --> 04:23:19.440]  That is my wish.
[04:23:19.440 --> 04:23:20.440]  I'm begging.
[04:23:20.440 --> 04:23:21.440]  I'm pleading.
[04:23:21.440 --> 04:23:24.440]  I'm asking, please do it.
[04:23:24.440 --> 04:23:32.440]  If they don't, if they don't, with the toxic gases that are coming out of this well with the oil,
[04:23:32.440 --> 04:23:39.440]  hydrogen sulfide, benzene, methylene chloride, and our stupid congressmen up there,
[04:23:39.440 --> 04:23:43.440]  they haven't got the backbone of a jellyfish.
[04:23:43.440 --> 04:23:45.440]  They don't have a pouch of care for human beings,
[04:23:45.440 --> 04:23:52.440]  or they'll be telling them what the environmental protection agency has found that is blowing over the land.
[04:23:52.440 --> 04:23:54.440]  Now, I was a pilot for 30 years.
[04:23:54.440 --> 04:23:58.440]  I know that prevailing winds are from the northwest to the southeast,
[04:23:58.440 --> 04:24:04.440]  and these gases are blowing over the delta, over Florida,
[04:24:04.440 --> 04:24:11.440]  and if they do not kept this well, you are going to see people sick.
[04:24:11.440 --> 04:24:16.440]  You might even see an evacuation of certain parts of the Gulf and Florida.
[04:24:16.440 --> 04:24:26.440]  It is going to affect the finances, the economy of this country in a way that you can't even imagine.
[04:24:26.440 --> 04:24:28.440]  Well, I certainly hope, I certainly hope that's not the case,
[04:24:28.440 --> 04:24:32.440]  but we're going to have to watch and see how that unfolds with Lindsay Williams.
[04:24:32.440 --> 04:24:37.440]  Lindsay, I want to take five calls or six calls right now in quick succession and then let you go
[04:24:37.440 --> 04:24:40.440]  and we'll get updates from you as this unfolds.
[04:24:40.440 --> 04:24:45.440]  But before we go to these calls, give folks the website and the phone number again
[04:24:45.440 --> 04:24:48.440]  because you called me about this in the last four or five days.
[04:24:48.440 --> 04:24:53.440]  You've been working on a DVD that was just completed or shot yesterday,
[04:24:53.440 --> 04:24:56.440]  where you break all this down into video format,
[04:24:56.440 --> 04:25:00.440]  and tell folks how they can get your breakdown of this information.
[04:25:00.440 --> 04:25:03.440]  I did a CD on yesterday.
[04:25:03.440 --> 04:25:04.440]  We had to do it quickly.
[04:25:04.440 --> 04:25:05.440]  Oh, so it's audio.
[04:25:05.440 --> 04:25:06.440]  Okay.
[04:25:06.440 --> 04:25:07.440]  I want to get this information out.
[04:25:07.440 --> 04:25:09.440]  All of what I've said today is on there,
[04:25:09.440 --> 04:25:12.440]  plus I have pages of information that's not there.
[04:25:12.440 --> 04:25:18.440]  I beg of you, you know my DVDs and CDs are not copyrighted.
[04:25:18.440 --> 04:25:21.440]  You must get this out to millions of Americans.
[04:25:21.440 --> 04:25:25.440]  Alex Jones show, you've got to get everybody to go on the web and look at it.
[04:25:25.440 --> 04:25:31.440]  Please call and get my 8 DVD set and the one that we produced on yesterday,
[04:25:31.440 --> 04:25:35.440]  which will tell you everything that's going on in the Gulf.
[04:25:35.440 --> 04:25:43.440]  The toll-free number is 888-799-6111.
[04:25:43.440 --> 04:25:45.440]  Now some people don't like to talk to an operator.
[04:25:45.440 --> 04:25:50.440]  Please go on the web to prophecyclub.com.
[04:25:50.440 --> 04:25:52.440]  You can get it there if you wish.
[04:25:52.440 --> 04:26:07.440]  P-R-O-P-H-E-C-Y-C-L-U-P.com or our toll-free number 888-799-6111.
[04:26:07.440 --> 04:26:12.440]  The operator standing by and oh, by the way, they will have English voices.
[04:26:12.440 --> 04:26:13.440]  It won't be a foreign operator.
[04:26:13.440 --> 04:26:16.440]  Please go to get an American that you talk with.
[04:26:16.440 --> 04:26:17.440]  Well, I know this, Lindsey.
[04:26:17.440 --> 04:26:20.440]  We're going to be able to sit here and watch this unfold and see what happens
[04:26:20.440 --> 04:26:22.440]  and always interesting information.
[04:26:22.440 --> 04:26:25.440]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in California.
[04:26:25.440 --> 04:26:27.440]  Mike, you're on the air.
[04:26:27.440 --> 04:26:29.440]  Thank you, sir.
[04:26:29.440 --> 04:26:30.440]  Yes.
[04:26:30.440 --> 04:26:32.440]  Okay, so that's how you just connected.
[04:26:32.440 --> 04:26:37.440]  I always thought I could think about being a personal engineer,
[04:26:37.440 --> 04:26:39.440]  so to speak, is fill all the fissures up with cement
[04:26:39.440 --> 04:26:41.440]  and then drop a million-ton weight over the center of a gun
[04:26:41.440 --> 04:26:43.440]  and see if that will cork it up.
[04:26:43.440 --> 04:26:44.440]  Because it would be cork it up,
[04:26:44.440 --> 04:26:47.440]  and then it would just whizz out of the other cracks a lot harder.
[04:26:47.440 --> 04:26:49.440]  That's a heck of a lot of pressure, sir.
[04:26:49.440 --> 04:26:52.440]  Do you know anything you would recommend is ignite it under the water
[04:26:52.440 --> 04:26:55.440]  and let it burn before it gets to the top?
[04:26:55.440 --> 04:26:57.440]  Well, that's what a lot of experts say
[04:26:57.440 --> 04:26:59.440]  was it should have been ignited the old-fashioned way
[04:26:59.440 --> 04:27:01.440]  right after it started leaking.
[04:27:01.440 --> 04:27:04.440]  That way it would all be contained and just turn into carbon.
[04:27:04.440 --> 04:27:06.440]  Carbon dioxide going to the atmosphere
[04:27:06.440 --> 04:27:08.440]  and a few other byproducts.
[04:27:08.440 --> 04:27:11.440]  Certainly not perfect, but better than what we're seeing now.
[04:27:11.440 --> 04:27:17.440]  But yeah, what about the idea of, say, having a million-pound weight
[04:27:17.440 --> 04:27:21.440]  that they then, you know, a position over it
[04:27:21.440 --> 04:27:24.440]  and then drop on top of it?
[04:27:24.440 --> 04:27:27.440]  I'm no engineer, but I mean, that might have an effect.
[04:27:27.440 --> 04:27:29.440]  But then, if it doesn't work,
[04:27:29.440 --> 04:27:31.440]  you've got oil coming out from beneath the weight,
[04:27:31.440 --> 04:27:36.440]  and it's even harder to get under there and take care of it.
[04:27:36.440 --> 04:27:38.440]  Well, there's an oxygen and hydrogen
[04:27:38.440 --> 04:27:41.440]  will burn under water as well if it's got enough oxygen to it.
[04:27:41.440 --> 04:27:43.440]  You could just burn it before it gets to the water
[04:27:43.440 --> 04:27:45.440]  and use the water as a filter.
[04:27:45.440 --> 04:27:48.440]  It would probably need to be filtered as well after it burns,
[04:27:48.440 --> 04:27:50.440]  but at least it wouldn't be escaping into the atmosphere
[04:27:50.440 --> 04:27:54.440]  and just have the potential to get all the way around the globe.
[04:27:54.440 --> 04:27:56.440]  Oh, absolutely.
[04:27:56.440 --> 04:27:58.440]  Well, I mean, it's just getting crazier and crazier
[04:27:58.440 --> 04:28:02.440]  because government doesn't know how to get rid of it,
[04:28:02.440 --> 04:28:04.440]  and now they're talking about a nuke.
[04:28:04.440 --> 04:28:07.440]  And I just can't imagine if they detonate a nuke down there
[04:28:07.440 --> 04:28:09.440]  and it just causes more fissures,
[04:28:09.440 --> 04:28:12.440]  and then instead of having one leak,
[04:28:12.440 --> 04:28:15.440]  it creates a bunch of other cracks and underground channels,
[04:28:15.440 --> 04:28:18.440]  you could have a mess many times worse.
[04:28:18.440 --> 04:28:21.440]  Instead of half million or million or whatever it really is,
[04:28:21.440 --> 04:28:24.440]  four or five million, like some of the Lindsay sources are saying,
[04:28:24.440 --> 04:28:27.440]  then it could be 10 million, 20 million.
[04:28:27.440 --> 04:28:32.440]  I mean, it's just, it's crazy to talk about using nuclear weapons down there,
[04:28:32.440 --> 04:28:35.440]  and I sure hope they haven't hit some new strata of oil,
[04:28:35.440 --> 04:28:37.440]  some new megastrada,
[04:28:37.440 --> 04:28:39.440]  and that this sucker could go on for years.
[04:28:39.440 --> 04:28:42.440]  I mean, this is, and can you imagine how government's going to say,
[04:28:42.440 --> 04:28:45.440]  listen, we got the solution.
[04:28:45.440 --> 04:28:47.440]  You pay Al Gore and the Rothschilds a big tax,
[04:28:47.440 --> 04:28:49.440]  and they'll wave an environmental wand,
[04:28:49.440 --> 04:28:52.440]  and see, we've got to get rid of the petroleum economy,
[04:28:52.440 --> 04:28:54.440]  and we've got to take control of society
[04:28:54.440 --> 04:28:57.440]  and make you all energy poor because of the oil spill,
[04:28:57.440 --> 04:29:00.440]  because of the oil spill, because of the oil spill,
[04:29:00.440 --> 04:29:04.440]  and how this is happening right on time for Obama.
[04:29:04.440 --> 04:29:06.440]  Yes, it's politically destroying him,
[04:29:06.440 --> 04:29:08.440]  it's going to politically hurt BP,
[04:29:08.440 --> 04:29:10.440]  but one thing I've found with the globalist is,
[04:29:10.440 --> 04:29:12.440]  they will fall on the sword individually
[04:29:12.440 --> 04:29:15.440]  to give more power to the organization.
[04:29:15.440 --> 04:29:16.440]  In fact, here's the headline,
[04:29:16.440 --> 04:29:19.440]  a spill costs mounts, BP shares tumble anew,
[04:29:19.440 --> 04:29:21.440]  U.S. lawmakers want more compensation.
[04:29:21.440 --> 04:29:23.440]  Obama, Cameron to discuss issue.
[04:29:23.440 --> 04:29:25.440]  Appreciate the call, Mike, good points.
[04:29:25.440 --> 04:29:27.440]  Lindsay Williams, what's your take on the idea
[04:29:27.440 --> 04:29:29.440]  he had for dropping a big weight on it?
[04:29:29.440 --> 04:29:32.440]  A number of years ago, I was on the Transylask oil pipeline,
[04:29:32.440 --> 04:29:36.440]  and they put in that 800-mile pipe over an inch thick.
[04:29:36.440 --> 04:29:40.440]  Two weeks ago, BP closed the Transylask oil pipeline.
[04:29:40.440 --> 04:29:42.440]  There's no oil flowing through it today.
[04:29:42.440 --> 04:29:46.440]  The reason being is that the abrasive substances in oil
[04:29:46.440 --> 04:29:49.440]  and the pig that they must run down that pipe
[04:29:49.440 --> 04:29:52.440]  from time to time to get out of the paraffin
[04:29:52.440 --> 04:29:55.440]  has so weakened the pipe,
[04:29:55.440 --> 04:29:58.440]  has broken it down to the point that it is so thin
[04:29:58.440 --> 04:30:01.440]  that it is almost like paper thickness in places,
[04:30:01.440 --> 04:30:06.440]  and the abrasiveness has destroyed the pipe
[04:30:06.440 --> 04:30:08.440]  and they're going to have to replace the entire thing
[04:30:08.440 --> 04:30:10.440]  if they get any more oil out of crude oil and Alaska.
[04:30:10.440 --> 04:30:13.440]  Now, the identical same thing is happening in the Gulf,
[04:30:13.440 --> 04:30:18.440]  except it's happening under pressures of 20 to 70,000 pounds,
[04:30:18.440 --> 04:30:22.440]  and the abrasiveness of that oil and what's coming up with it
[04:30:22.440 --> 04:30:26.440]  is eroding the thickness of that pipe so rapidly
[04:30:26.440 --> 04:30:28.440]  that if they wait a few more months
[04:30:28.440 --> 04:30:30.440]  to try to go down and do anything about it,
[04:30:30.440 --> 04:30:32.440]  they'll have no pipe left.
[04:30:32.440 --> 04:30:35.440]  I mean, this was a subject we didn't even cover before
[04:30:35.440 --> 04:30:37.440]  because there's still so much material here,
[04:30:37.440 --> 04:30:39.440]  but that very easily could happen
[04:30:39.440 --> 04:30:42.440]  and that pipe is eroding by the minute.
[04:30:42.440 --> 04:30:45.440]  Well, look what rivers do to create the Grand Canyon.
[04:30:45.440 --> 04:30:48.440]  Water cuts through solid rock over time.
[04:30:48.440 --> 04:30:52.440]  Imagine what oil with all those chemicals just blasting out
[04:30:52.440 --> 04:30:54.440]  is going to do to that pipe,
[04:30:54.440 --> 04:30:57.440]  but again, it looks like the pipe's already,
[04:30:57.440 --> 04:30:59.440]  the casing's already not intact
[04:30:59.440 --> 04:31:02.440]  because you've got all these other leaks coming up around there.
[04:31:02.440 --> 04:31:03.440]  This doesn't look good.
[04:31:03.440 --> 04:31:06.440]  The casing appears to have ruptured
[04:31:06.440 --> 04:31:08.440]  at the time of the original blow
[04:31:08.440 --> 04:31:10.440]  because the pressure was so high.
[04:31:10.440 --> 04:31:12.440]  That's what it appears.
[04:31:12.440 --> 04:31:14.440]  Notice how I use the word appears
[04:31:14.440 --> 04:31:17.440]  because we're getting these fissures
[04:31:17.440 --> 04:31:21.440]  as much as, in a way, they're set up to 20 miles long.
[04:31:21.440 --> 04:31:24.440]  The furthest I've heard personally is five miles away,
[04:31:24.440 --> 04:31:27.440]  but these are being caused by other ruptures
[04:31:27.440 --> 04:31:28.440]  that go down in there somewhere.
[04:31:28.440 --> 04:31:32.440]  Josh in Alabama, you're on the air.
[04:31:32.440 --> 04:31:35.440]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[04:31:35.440 --> 04:31:37.440]  I just want to let you know,
[04:31:37.440 --> 04:31:40.440]  I was down in Gulf Shores, Alabama, yesterday,
[04:31:40.440 --> 04:31:45.440]  and there's a very large amount of tar balls
[04:31:45.440 --> 04:31:47.440]  all over the beach down there.
[04:31:47.440 --> 04:31:50.440]  I just wanted to confirm that for you.
[04:31:50.440 --> 04:31:52.440]  Also, there was a private company
[04:31:52.440 --> 04:31:56.440]  called Clean Harbor.
[04:31:56.440 --> 04:32:01.440]  They were there as probably 10 guys on ATVs.
[04:32:01.440 --> 04:32:03.440]  We spent probably three hours there.
[04:32:03.440 --> 04:32:08.440]  I'm heading back out of town north on 59th.
[04:32:08.440 --> 04:32:16.440]  Two Humvees, probably four or five troops per Humvee.
[04:32:16.440 --> 04:32:18.440]  You're asking?
[04:32:18.440 --> 04:32:20.440]  We know military's down there.
[04:32:20.440 --> 04:32:22.440]  We're just curious if they're telling people
[04:32:22.440 --> 04:32:24.440]  to evacuate like some reports have said.
[04:32:24.440 --> 04:32:26.440]  Nothing.
[04:32:26.440 --> 04:32:28.440]  It was just only benign.
[04:32:28.440 --> 04:32:30.440]  They were heading north out of town,
[04:32:30.440 --> 04:32:32.440]  but that's all we saw.
[04:32:32.440 --> 04:32:34.440]  Now, do these tar balls look fresh?
[04:32:34.440 --> 04:32:36.440]  Do they have any crustaceans growing on them?
[04:32:36.440 --> 04:32:39.440]  No, they're really liquidy.
[04:32:39.440 --> 04:32:42.440]  We haven't smashed all in the bottom of our feet.
[04:32:42.440 --> 04:32:44.440]  So they're new, yeah,
[04:32:44.440 --> 04:32:46.440]  because an old tar ball will have crustaceans
[04:32:46.440 --> 04:32:48.440]  and things growing on it.
[04:32:48.440 --> 04:32:50.440]  I know that going to the beach over the years.
[04:32:50.440 --> 04:32:52.440]  It sounds like, like Lindsay said,
[04:32:52.440 --> 04:32:54.440]  they've been getting semi-frozen
[04:32:54.440 --> 04:32:56.440]  and then congealing 5,000 feet down.
[04:32:56.440 --> 04:32:58.440]  I mean, it's just freezing cold.
[04:32:58.440 --> 04:33:00.440]  Anything else, Josh?
[04:33:00.440 --> 04:33:02.440]  Thank you, Josh, so much for that call.
[04:33:02.440 --> 04:33:04.440]  Let's talk to Mike in New Orleans.
[04:33:04.440 --> 04:33:06.440]  Well, boy, they got Katrina on now this.
[04:33:06.440 --> 04:33:08.440]  Mike, thanks for holding.
[04:33:08.440 --> 04:33:10.440]  Welcome.
[04:33:10.440 --> 04:33:12.440]  Yes, thanks for taking my call.
[04:33:12.440 --> 04:33:16.440]  I work, I work for an independent newspaper in New Orleans.
[04:33:16.440 --> 04:33:18.440]  I have two deep sources
[04:33:18.440 --> 04:33:20.440]  that have their feet on the ground.
[04:33:20.440 --> 04:33:22.440]  I have,
[04:33:22.440 --> 04:33:24.440]  I will tell you what I have confirmed.
[04:33:26.440 --> 04:33:28.440]  What I have confirmed
[04:33:28.440 --> 04:33:30.440]  is that BP
[04:33:30.440 --> 04:33:32.440]  is in charge of everything.
[04:33:32.440 --> 04:33:34.440]  And when I say everything, I mean everything.
[04:33:34.440 --> 04:33:36.440]  They are in charge of the police.
[04:33:36.440 --> 04:33:38.440]  They are in charge of
[04:33:38.440 --> 04:33:40.440]  it all.
[04:33:40.440 --> 04:33:42.440]  They are
[04:33:42.440 --> 04:33:44.440]  and do have
[04:33:44.440 --> 04:33:46.440]  a complete media blackout
[04:33:46.440 --> 04:33:48.440]  on what's going on.
[04:33:48.440 --> 04:33:50.440]  They do not allow any cameras in.
[04:33:52.440 --> 04:33:54.440]  There's no confirmation yet
[04:33:54.440 --> 04:33:56.440]  on arrest, but they are threatening arrest.
[04:33:56.440 --> 04:33:58.440]  They have
[04:33:58.440 --> 04:34:00.440]  all of that area,
[04:34:00.440 --> 04:34:02.440]  all of the people in that area
[04:34:02.440 --> 04:34:04.440]  completely intimidated.
[04:34:04.440 --> 04:34:06.440]  Nobody's talking to anybody.
[04:34:06.440 --> 04:34:08.440]  Well, two weeks ago, they were pulling up to CBS
[04:34:08.440 --> 04:34:10.440]  and ABC and local reporters
[04:34:10.440 --> 04:34:12.440]  with the Coast Guard saying,
[04:34:12.440 --> 04:34:14.440]  we work for BP under orders of BP,
[04:34:14.440 --> 04:34:16.440]  no videotaping beaches.
[04:34:16.440 --> 04:34:18.440]  I guess BP is instead of getting in trouble
[04:34:18.440 --> 04:34:20.440]  for this, they may become our new kings
[04:34:20.440 --> 04:34:22.440]  or something.
[04:34:22.440 --> 04:34:24.440]  I'm telling you, there's an army
[04:34:24.440 --> 04:34:26.440]  of BP thugs down there.
[04:34:26.440 --> 04:34:28.440]  So far,
[04:34:28.440 --> 04:34:30.440]  it's only been the Coast Guard
[04:34:30.440 --> 04:34:32.440]  and the local authorities that are working
[04:34:32.440 --> 04:34:34.440]  in conjunction with them.
[04:34:34.440 --> 04:34:36.440]  There has been no sightings of any military,
[04:34:36.440 --> 04:34:38.440]  but all from what I have just heard
[04:34:38.440 --> 04:34:40.440]  and all
[04:34:40.440 --> 04:34:42.440]  from the feeling that is going on,
[04:34:42.440 --> 04:34:44.440]  I can only
[04:34:44.440 --> 04:34:46.440]  speculate that
[04:34:46.440 --> 04:34:48.440]  sorry, go ahead.
[04:34:48.440 --> 04:34:50.440]  I can only speculate, especially
[04:34:50.440 --> 04:34:52.440]  if a storm comes along that.
[04:34:52.440 --> 04:34:54.440]  We're going to be looking at man's evacuations
[04:34:54.440 --> 04:34:56.440]  from this area.
[04:34:56.440 --> 04:34:58.440]  Now, what are the BP, you call them thugs,
[04:34:58.440 --> 04:35:00.440]  what are they doing, just letting you know
[04:35:00.440 --> 04:35:02.440]  that they're in command in your scum?
[04:35:02.440 --> 04:35:04.440]  More than that.
[04:35:04.440 --> 04:35:06.440]  They are beyond the
[04:35:06.440 --> 04:35:08.440]  intimidating the workers
[04:35:08.440 --> 04:35:10.440]  into signing non-declosure forms.
[04:35:10.440 --> 04:35:12.440]  They are
[04:35:12.440 --> 04:35:14.440]  reports and this is confirmed
[04:35:14.440 --> 04:35:16.440]  of them having the crews stand
[04:35:16.440 --> 04:35:18.440]  down as swaths of oil
[04:35:18.440 --> 04:35:20.440]  has washed ashore.
[04:35:20.440 --> 04:35:22.440]  This is confirmed.
[04:35:22.440 --> 04:35:24.440]  So wait, they have the crews stand
[04:35:24.440 --> 04:35:26.440]  down and they let the oil come in?
[04:35:26.440 --> 04:35:28.440]  Correct.
[04:35:28.440 --> 04:35:30.440]  And do people ask why?
[04:35:30.440 --> 04:35:32.440]  They're intimidated. They're scared to death.
[04:35:32.440 --> 04:35:34.440]  What's the feeling?
[04:35:34.440 --> 04:35:36.440]  Is this so Barry Sitaro,
[04:35:36.440 --> 04:35:38.440]  Barack Hussein Obama,
[04:35:38.440 --> 04:35:40.440]  President Hussein can get
[04:35:40.440 --> 04:35:42.440]  his environmental takeover?
[04:35:42.440 --> 04:35:44.440]  Why let the oil come in?
[04:35:44.440 --> 04:35:46.440]  Why a month ago, not let the locals
[04:35:46.440 --> 04:35:48.440]  put the booms in front of the estuaries?
[04:35:48.440 --> 04:35:50.440]  Why did they let that come in?
[04:35:50.440 --> 04:35:52.440]  Indeed.
[04:35:52.440 --> 04:35:54.440]  Again, confirmation that the BP people
[04:35:54.440 --> 04:35:56.440]  abandoned 44 boats
[04:35:56.440 --> 04:35:58.440]  that were ready to go out there
[04:35:58.440 --> 04:36:00.440]  and corral the first oil
[04:36:00.440 --> 04:36:02.440]  that was coming into the marshes.
[04:36:02.440 --> 04:36:04.440]  They just abandoned them as oil.
[04:36:04.440 --> 04:36:06.440]  I want to continue with you, Mike.
[04:36:06.440 --> 04:36:08.440]  If you want to plug your independent newspaper,
[04:36:08.440 --> 04:36:10.440]  we can talk to you.
[04:36:10.440 --> 04:36:12.440]  I'm going to do more shows just on this now.
[04:36:12.440 --> 04:36:14.440]  I'm getting to realize this is just getting worse
[04:36:14.440 --> 04:36:16.440]  and worse by the minute.
[04:36:16.440 --> 04:36:18.440]  But, Lindsay, again, everything
[04:36:18.440 --> 04:36:20.440]  he's saying dovetails
[04:36:20.440 --> 04:36:22.440]  with what you've been saying.
[04:36:22.440 --> 04:36:24.440]  Every call that you've had called in today,
[04:36:24.440 --> 04:36:26.440]  from the technician
[04:36:26.440 --> 04:36:28.440]  to you name it, has basically
[04:36:28.440 --> 04:36:30.440]  confirmed everything that Mr. X
[04:36:30.440 --> 04:36:32.440]  from my book Energy Non Crisis told me.
[04:36:32.440 --> 04:36:34.440]  I am so glad this be the case
[04:36:34.440 --> 04:36:36.440]  because I didn't have the slightest idea.
[04:36:36.440 --> 04:36:38.440]  This is the first time I've given this, Alex.
[04:36:38.440 --> 04:36:40.440]  Do you realize how bold you are,
[04:36:40.440 --> 04:36:42.440]  Alex Jones, to allow this program
[04:36:42.440 --> 04:36:44.440]  to go on today?
[04:36:44.440 --> 04:36:46.440]  I really want to, you know,
[04:36:46.440 --> 04:36:48.440]  I heard you on George Murray on Monday night,
[04:36:48.440 --> 04:36:50.440]  by the way, he did a great job.
[04:36:50.440 --> 04:36:52.440]  He asked you the story about the oil spill down there.
[04:36:52.440 --> 04:36:54.440]  I noticed at the time
[04:36:54.440 --> 04:36:56.440]  I wondered
[04:36:56.440 --> 04:36:58.440]  is he really going to allow me to be on today
[04:36:58.440 --> 04:37:00.440]  and tell this story?
[04:37:00.440 --> 04:37:02.440]  You are a bold talk show host
[04:37:02.440 --> 04:37:04.440]  to even allow this to be told.
[04:37:04.440 --> 04:37:06.440]  I hope he's not the guy you were waiting
[04:37:06.440 --> 04:37:08.440]  to get on me before you go on him
[04:37:08.440 --> 04:37:10.440]  because I appreciate you doing that, Lindsay.
[04:37:10.440 --> 04:37:12.440]  No, I haven't even called George Murray at all.
[04:37:12.440 --> 04:37:14.440]  I called you a producer the other day
[04:37:14.440 --> 04:37:16.440]  and I didn't call him out.
[04:37:16.440 --> 04:37:18.440]  Well, thank you. We need to get you on.
[04:37:18.440 --> 04:37:20.440]  We need to get you...
[04:37:20.440 --> 04:37:22.440]  If you want to put in a workflow move to George,
[04:37:22.440 --> 04:37:24.440]  it'll be fine.
[04:37:24.440 --> 04:37:26.440]  No, we need to get you on more shows right away
[04:37:26.440 --> 04:37:28.440]  because this is important.
[04:37:28.440 --> 04:37:30.440]  Tell him I can answer those questions for him.
[04:37:30.440 --> 04:37:32.440]  Absolutely. I'll let him know that.
[04:37:32.440 --> 04:37:34.440]  I don't have really any control over
[04:37:34.440 --> 04:37:36.440]  what they put on, but I can certainly recommend it.
[04:37:38.440 --> 04:37:40.440]  Just expanding on that,
[04:37:40.440 --> 04:37:42.440]  though, you're saying it was an accident
[04:37:42.440 --> 04:37:44.440]  but they're going
[04:37:44.440 --> 04:37:46.440]  to let it continue to flow
[04:37:46.440 --> 04:37:48.440]  as a pretext to take over.
[04:37:48.440 --> 04:37:50.440]  Is that what you said earlier?
[04:37:50.440 --> 04:37:52.440]  Well, they can't stop it.
[04:37:52.440 --> 04:37:54.440]  They have no way in the world
[04:37:54.440 --> 04:37:56.440]  of doing anything about this except on you.
[04:37:56.440 --> 04:37:58.440]  They're not going to let a good crisis go to waste
[04:37:58.440 --> 04:38:00.440]  and they're going to use that.
[04:38:00.440 --> 04:38:02.440]  George, in your mouth, but is that what you said last hour?
[04:38:02.440 --> 04:38:04.440]  Okay. I have been told
[04:38:04.440 --> 04:38:06.440]  it was intimated.
[04:38:06.440 --> 04:38:08.440]  You know how they have a way of saying,
[04:38:08.440 --> 04:38:10.440]  now, Chaplain, you know this to be true.
[04:38:10.440 --> 04:38:12.440]  It has been intimated to me
[04:38:12.440 --> 04:38:14.440]  that everything that I was told a year and a half ago
[04:38:14.440 --> 04:38:16.440]  is to their timeline
[04:38:16.440 --> 04:38:18.440]  that now they're going to use this
[04:38:18.440 --> 04:38:20.440]  as a method of fulfillment.
[04:38:20.440 --> 04:38:22.440]  And if people want to know what that timeline is,
[04:38:22.440 --> 04:38:24.440]  they can call our toll-free number
[04:38:24.440 --> 04:38:26.440]  and we have six DVDs on it.
[04:38:26.440 --> 04:38:28.440]  Yeah, that's amazing
[04:38:28.440 --> 04:38:30.440]  because this information dovetails,
[04:38:30.440 --> 04:38:32.440]  again, we keep using that word dovetails,
[04:38:32.440 --> 04:38:34.440]  but hooks into past info.
[04:38:34.440 --> 04:38:36.440]  Mike, anything else from New Orleans?
[04:38:38.440 --> 04:38:40.440]  Not really, Alex.
[04:38:40.440 --> 04:38:42.440]  I have asked my sources
[04:38:42.440 --> 04:38:44.440]  that are deep in there to go ahead
[04:38:44.440 --> 04:38:46.440]  and they're going to get back to me shortly
[04:38:46.440 --> 04:38:48.440]  with any new information
[04:38:48.440 --> 04:38:50.440]  if they have witnessed any arrest
[04:38:50.440 --> 04:38:52.440]  and what for.
[04:38:52.440 --> 04:38:54.440]  Who's doing the arresting?
[04:38:54.440 --> 04:38:56.440]  What charges?
[04:38:56.440 --> 04:38:58.440]  Those kind of things
[04:38:58.440 --> 04:39:00.440]  is what I've asked them to check into.
[04:39:00.440 --> 04:39:02.440]  And so there's like
[04:39:02.440 --> 04:39:04.440]  strong men stomping around
[04:39:04.440 --> 04:39:06.440]  letting Louisianans know
[04:39:06.440 --> 04:39:08.440]  that they're the boss.
[04:39:08.440 --> 04:39:10.440]  Because people keep describing them as thugs
[04:39:10.440 --> 04:39:12.440]  even in other newspapers.
[04:39:12.440 --> 04:39:14.440]  So I guess they just walk up
[04:39:14.440 --> 04:39:16.440]  like a wrench and go,
[04:39:16.440 --> 04:39:18.440]  this is our area now, boy.
[04:39:18.440 --> 04:39:20.440]  You do what BP says.
[04:39:20.440 --> 04:39:22.440]  Don't you get up
[04:39:22.440 --> 04:39:24.440]  and flood you with oil?
[04:39:24.440 --> 04:39:26.440]  I hate to do the Italian mobster accent,
[04:39:26.440 --> 04:39:28.440]  but what are they doing?
[04:39:28.440 --> 04:39:30.440]  They have got the people
[04:39:30.440 --> 04:39:32.440]  so intimidated down there
[04:39:32.440 --> 04:39:34.440]  that they're afraid to even talk
[04:39:34.440 --> 04:39:36.440]  among themselves.
[04:39:36.440 --> 04:39:38.440]  Strangers,
[04:39:38.440 --> 04:39:40.440]  you just have to, it's like pulling teeth.
[04:39:40.440 --> 04:39:42.440]  So whatever
[04:39:42.440 --> 04:39:44.440]  they're doing
[04:39:44.440 --> 04:39:46.440]  is rough.
[04:39:46.440 --> 04:39:48.440]  Well, that's like they have
[04:39:48.440 --> 04:39:50.440]  an article today
[04:39:50.440 --> 04:39:52.440]  which talks about the vanity
[04:39:52.440 --> 04:39:54.440]  of airline passengers and it says
[04:39:54.440 --> 04:39:56.440]  they don't like the body scanners
[04:39:56.440 --> 04:39:58.440]  or being strip searched in public.
[04:39:58.440 --> 04:40:00.440]  They're scum, basically.
[04:40:00.440 --> 04:40:02.440]  Where everything's backwards, it's like
[04:40:02.440 --> 04:40:04.440]  you don't like being strip searched, now they strip search you?
[04:40:04.440 --> 04:40:06.440]  You don't like having DNA taken without a warrant
[04:40:06.440 --> 04:40:08.440]  on the side of the highway?
[04:40:08.440 --> 04:40:10.440]  You're a vain piece of garbage.
[04:40:10.440 --> 04:40:12.440]  Not you have rights, you have dignity.
[04:40:12.440 --> 04:40:14.440]  Not you don't want to be humiliated.
[04:40:14.440 --> 04:40:16.440]  I mean, it's just everything is like
[04:40:16.440 --> 04:40:18.440]  going into flocks
[04:40:18.440 --> 04:40:20.440]  converting us over to pure evil
[04:40:20.440 --> 04:40:22.440]  at every level. Mike, I appreciate your call.
[04:40:22.440 --> 04:40:24.440]  Stay in contact.
[04:40:24.440 --> 04:40:26.440]  You got to remember that these communities down there
[04:40:26.440 --> 04:40:28.440]  are very, very small, so it's not that hard
[04:40:28.440 --> 04:40:30.440]  to go ahead and overtake them.
[04:40:30.440 --> 04:40:32.440]  No, no, I'm not bashing these people.
[04:40:32.440 --> 04:40:34.440]  I just, somebody needs to stand up for them
[04:40:34.440 --> 04:40:36.440]  and these BP guys, though,
[04:40:36.440 --> 04:40:38.440]  they want to intimidate and be the boss
[04:40:38.440 --> 04:40:40.440]  because they know they've done wrong
[04:40:40.440 --> 04:40:42.440]  at destroying these communities
[04:40:42.440 --> 04:40:44.440]  and so it's like, you know what we say,
[04:40:44.440 --> 04:40:46.440]  get down there.
[04:40:46.440 --> 04:40:48.440]  That way they're already dominating them
[04:40:48.440 --> 04:40:50.440]  so the people never get angry
[04:40:50.440 --> 04:40:52.440]  and stand up against them.
[04:40:52.440 --> 04:40:54.440]  Next, they'll be calling the locals terrorists.
[04:40:54.440 --> 04:40:56.440]  You don't like oil all over you?
[04:40:56.440 --> 04:40:58.440]  You're a terrorist.
[04:40:58.440 --> 04:41:00.440]  You don't like Obama banning all fishing out here
[04:41:00.440 --> 04:41:02.440]  even though there's no oil? You're a terrorist.
[04:41:02.440 --> 04:41:04.440]  You don't like giving your rights up?
[04:41:04.440 --> 04:41:06.440]  You're a terrorist.
[04:41:06.440 --> 04:41:08.440]  Literally, it's like Homeland Security
[04:41:08.440 --> 04:41:10.440]  dealing with evil terrorists in Louisiana.
[04:41:10.440 --> 04:41:12.440]  Maybe they caused the oil spill.
[04:41:12.440 --> 04:41:14.440]  Maybe it's their fault
[04:41:14.440 --> 04:41:16.440]  or maybe Bin Laden's hiding in New Orleans.
[04:41:16.440 --> 04:41:18.440]  Maybe tactical nukes are needed there.
[04:41:18.440 --> 04:41:20.440]  I mean, I'm being sarcastic,
[04:41:20.440 --> 04:41:22.440]  but that's the absurdness of it.
[04:41:22.440 --> 04:41:24.440]  Let's talk to John in Louisiana.
[04:41:24.440 --> 04:41:26.440]  A lot of calls from there.
[04:41:26.440 --> 04:41:28.440]  John, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[04:41:28.440 --> 04:41:30.440]  How you doing, Alex? Good, sir.
[04:41:30.440 --> 04:41:34.440]  I went out there as media
[04:41:34.440 --> 04:41:37.440]  and they had a little media show for us
[04:41:37.440 --> 04:41:40.440]  because, you know, that's how they operate.
[04:41:40.440 --> 04:41:42.440]  And of course, you know, they were laying the boons
[04:41:42.440 --> 04:41:46.440]  and stuff like that in the media op.
[04:41:46.440 --> 04:41:48.440]  But you can look down the beach
[04:41:48.440 --> 04:41:50.440]  and there's no clean occurs.
[04:41:50.440 --> 04:41:52.440]  None of that.
[04:41:52.440 --> 04:41:54.440]  The military is over there
[04:41:54.440 --> 04:41:56.440]  and they're acting really suspicious.
[04:41:56.440 --> 04:41:58.440]  They don't talk.
[04:41:58.440 --> 04:42:00.440]  They always like watching.
[04:42:00.440 --> 04:42:02.440]  You're always looking at their feet.
[04:42:02.440 --> 04:42:04.440]  Well, they don't talk to slaves.
[04:42:04.440 --> 04:42:06.440]  You're just there to pay taxes.
[04:42:06.440 --> 04:42:08.440]  You're nothing but a blood bag to feed
[04:42:08.440 --> 04:42:10.440]  the New World Order.
[04:42:10.440 --> 04:42:12.440]  Now, specifically, yeah,
[04:42:12.440 --> 04:42:14.440]  they're having some photo ops
[04:42:14.440 --> 04:42:16.440]  and so you were brought down
[04:42:16.440 --> 04:42:18.440]  to be shown a photo op,
[04:42:18.440 --> 04:42:20.440]  but then you noticed it was just a photo op.
[04:42:20.440 --> 04:42:22.440]  Yeah, I mean, you can tell.
[04:42:22.440 --> 04:42:24.440]  I'm sure the mainstream media
[04:42:24.440 --> 04:42:26.440]  that was also there with us
[04:42:26.440 --> 04:42:28.440]  knew it was a photo op,
[04:42:28.440 --> 04:42:30.440]  but, you know, they don't care.
[04:42:30.440 --> 04:42:32.440]  Most of them don't.
[04:42:32.440 --> 04:42:34.440]  Well, how much oil did you see
[04:42:34.440 --> 04:42:36.440]  in the surrounding areas there in Louisiana?
[04:42:36.440 --> 04:42:38.440]  Oh, yeah.
[04:42:38.440 --> 04:42:40.440]  There's rocks
[04:42:40.440 --> 04:42:42.440]  on about
[04:42:42.440 --> 04:42:44.440]  200
[04:42:44.440 --> 04:42:46.440]  yards off the shore
[04:42:46.440 --> 04:42:48.440]  and they're black
[04:42:48.440 --> 04:42:50.440]  and it looks like
[04:42:50.440 --> 04:42:52.440]  orange, brownish looking thing.
[04:42:52.440 --> 04:42:54.440]  It's really nasty looking.
[04:42:54.440 --> 04:42:56.440]  You can tell it's
[04:42:56.440 --> 04:42:58.440]  definitely really, really bad.
[04:42:58.440 --> 04:43:00.440]  There's oil all along the beaches
[04:43:00.440 --> 04:43:02.440]  and there's no clean up cruise
[04:43:02.440 --> 04:43:04.440]  and when they
[04:43:04.440 --> 04:43:06.440]  showed the most clean up cruise
[04:43:06.440 --> 04:43:08.440]  they would shoot their cameras.
[04:43:10.440 --> 04:43:12.440]  What about these reports
[04:43:12.440 --> 04:43:14.440]  that I've seen confirmed in the news
[04:43:14.440 --> 04:43:16.440]  where foreign governments
[04:43:16.440 --> 04:43:18.440]  like the Dutch are refused,
[04:43:18.440 --> 04:43:20.440]  even though they have ships in the area,
[04:43:20.440 --> 04:43:22.440]  the military is not allowed to help,
[04:43:22.440 --> 04:43:24.440]  that the military will demand that
[04:43:24.440 --> 04:43:26.440]  we've got to count these booms
[04:43:26.440 --> 04:43:28.440]  over and over again for five, six days
[04:43:28.440 --> 04:43:30.440]  and then they say now we're not going to allow you to put the booms out.
[04:43:30.440 --> 04:43:32.440]  I mean, that's confirmed.
[04:43:32.440 --> 04:43:34.440]  Why does the military go along with those orders, Lindsay Williams?
[04:43:34.440 --> 04:43:36.440]  I wish I knew, Eric.
[04:43:36.440 --> 04:43:38.440]  I can't believe, Alex,
[04:43:38.440 --> 04:43:40.440]  that they
[04:43:40.440 --> 04:43:42.440]  that there are people
[04:43:42.440 --> 04:43:44.440]  you know, Alex,
[04:43:44.440 --> 04:43:46.440]  I'm like you.
[04:43:46.440 --> 04:43:48.440]  I believe in telling the truth, regardless.
[04:43:48.440 --> 04:43:50.440]  And I was taught that from a child
[04:43:50.440 --> 04:43:52.440]  and I still do it today.
[04:43:52.440 --> 04:43:54.440]  I guess there's so many people in the country
[04:43:54.440 --> 04:43:56.440]  that are intimidated
[04:43:56.440 --> 04:43:58.440]  by their higher ups.
[04:43:58.440 --> 04:44:00.440]  They've been brainwashed into believing
[04:44:00.440 --> 04:44:02.440]  that they ought to go along with everything
[04:44:02.440 --> 04:44:04.440]  that they thought would cause them to do such things.
[04:44:04.440 --> 04:44:06.440]  They're realizing that people's lives are at stake.
[04:44:08.440 --> 04:44:10.440]  It's just horrible.
[04:44:10.440 --> 04:44:12.440]  Two final calls will let Lindsay go
[04:44:12.440 --> 04:44:14.440]  and go back into retransmission.
[04:44:14.440 --> 04:44:16.440]  Let's go ahead and talk
[04:44:16.440 --> 04:44:18.440]  to John, Louisiana, and Gary.
[04:44:18.440 --> 04:44:20.440]  John, thanks for holding.
[04:44:20.440 --> 04:44:22.440]  Hello?
[04:44:22.440 --> 04:44:24.440]  Yeah, John, go ahead.
[04:44:24.440 --> 04:44:26.440]  Oh!
[04:44:26.440 --> 04:44:28.440]  I'm still on.
[04:44:28.440 --> 04:44:30.440]  Oh, yeah.
[04:44:30.440 --> 04:44:32.440]  All the way.
[04:44:32.440 --> 04:44:34.440]  That's all.
[04:44:34.440 --> 04:44:36.440]  You know what, they didn't disconnect your call
[04:44:36.440 --> 04:44:38.440]  when I said thanks for the call,
[04:44:38.440 --> 04:44:40.440]  so I thought it was another John from Louisiana.
[04:44:40.440 --> 04:44:42.440]  I apologize, or I never let you go.
[04:44:42.440 --> 04:44:44.440]  Let's go to Gary in New Orleans.
[04:44:44.440 --> 04:44:46.440]  Gary, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[04:44:46.440 --> 04:44:48.440]  Mayday, Mayday, Alex.
[04:44:48.440 --> 04:44:50.440]  If we ever needed your bullhorn,
[04:44:50.440 --> 04:44:52.440]  we need it now down here.
[04:44:52.440 --> 04:44:54.440]  I recognize Gary. I know your voice.
[04:44:54.440 --> 04:44:56.440]  You're a talk show host down in New Orleans.
[04:44:56.440 --> 04:44:58.440]  Yes, sir.
[04:44:58.440 --> 04:45:00.440]  I've been working with calling Alex Jones
[04:45:00.440 --> 04:45:02.440]  to get out there and do it yourself.
[04:45:02.440 --> 04:45:04.440]  So, I've been down on the island
[04:45:04.440 --> 04:45:06.440]  and pretty much what's happening,
[04:45:06.440 --> 04:45:08.440]  there are no armed troops as of yet.
[04:45:08.440 --> 04:45:10.440]  Now, there is
[04:45:10.440 --> 04:45:12.440]  a report from
[04:45:12.440 --> 04:45:14.440]  the Washington AP
[04:45:14.440 --> 04:45:16.440]  that the State Departments
[04:45:16.440 --> 04:45:18.440]  are considering assistance from 13
[04:45:18.440 --> 04:45:20.440]  countries, and
[04:45:20.440 --> 04:45:22.440]  State Department
[04:45:22.440 --> 04:45:24.440]  Crowley is stating that
[04:45:24.440 --> 04:45:26.440]  there's going to be German,
[04:45:26.440 --> 04:45:28.440]  France, Britain, and also the
[04:45:28.440 --> 04:45:30.440]  UN Environmental Program.
[04:45:30.440 --> 04:45:32.440]  So, if you've seen the report from
[04:45:32.440 --> 04:45:34.440]  Iron Mountain, that might tell you a little bit.
[04:45:34.440 --> 04:45:36.440]  Oh, no, give me that headline. This is big news.
[04:45:36.440 --> 04:45:38.440]  What's the headline on the troops
[04:45:38.440 --> 04:45:40.440]  from 13 countries?
[04:45:40.440 --> 04:45:42.440]  Well, 13 nations
[04:45:42.440 --> 04:45:44.440]  and UN offering help, U.S. says.
[04:45:44.440 --> 04:45:46.440]  And
[04:45:46.440 --> 04:45:48.440]  it's a four paragraph
[04:45:48.440 --> 04:45:50.440]  for me to read real quick.
[04:45:50.440 --> 04:45:52.440]  Yeah, go ahead.
[04:45:52.440 --> 04:45:54.440]  All right, the State Department says
[04:45:54.440 --> 04:45:56.440]  of assistance from 13 countries
[04:45:56.440 --> 04:45:58.440]  and the United Nations to help
[04:45:58.440 --> 04:46:00.440]  in the massive oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico,
[04:46:00.440 --> 04:46:02.440]  U.S. neighbors,
[04:46:02.440 --> 04:46:04.440]  Canada and Mexico are among those offering
[04:46:04.440 --> 04:46:06.440]  equipment and experts in containing
[04:46:06.440 --> 04:46:08.440]  the cleanup and the leak
[04:46:08.440 --> 04:46:10.440]  of the BT oil spill box.
[04:46:10.440 --> 04:46:12.440]  All right then, State Department Spokeman
[04:46:12.440 --> 04:46:14.440]  P.J. Crowley said Wednesday
[04:46:14.440 --> 04:46:16.440]  that Coast Guard is evaluating
[04:46:16.440 --> 04:46:18.440]  the needs of the cleanup operations
[04:46:18.440 --> 04:46:20.440]  and will decide what, if any,
[04:46:20.440 --> 04:46:22.440]  aid to accept in the coming
[04:46:22.440 --> 04:46:24.440]  days. And the last paragraph is also
[04:46:24.440 --> 04:46:26.440]  offering aid is Britain,
[04:46:26.440 --> 04:46:28.440]  France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands,
[04:46:28.440 --> 04:46:30.440]  Norway, Romania, South Korea,
[04:46:30.440 --> 04:46:32.440]  Spain, Sweden and the UN
[04:46:32.440 --> 04:46:34.440]  Environmental Program.
[04:46:34.440 --> 04:46:36.440]  Yeah, no, I've got the article here
[04:46:36.440 --> 04:46:38.440]  at Sweden and the UN Environmental
[04:46:38.440 --> 04:46:40.440]  Program, so we've got that.
[04:46:40.440 --> 04:46:42.440]  And again, it'd be
[04:46:42.440 --> 04:46:44.440]  one thing if early on
[04:46:44.440 --> 04:46:46.440]  you have Dutch ships in the area with the
[04:46:46.440 --> 04:46:48.440]  booms, they say, hey, let us help you let them.
[04:46:48.440 --> 04:46:50.440]  But it's another thing to wait 40 plus
[04:46:50.440 --> 04:46:52.440]  days, not let the states,
[04:46:52.440 --> 04:46:54.440]  they're not letting
[04:46:54.440 --> 04:46:56.440]  gentle, they're not letting the Louisiana
[04:46:56.440 --> 04:46:58.440]  Governor, they're not letting the Mississippi
[04:46:58.440 --> 04:47:00.440]  Governor, they're not letting Florida
[04:47:00.440 --> 04:47:02.440]  go in. Well, how can the
[04:47:02.440 --> 04:47:04.440]  feds tell the states
[04:47:04.440 --> 04:47:06.440]  what they can and can't do?
[04:47:06.440 --> 04:47:08.440]  I mean, this is a Ninth and Tenth Amendment
[04:47:08.440 --> 04:47:10.440]  issue, a states' rights issue, but
[04:47:10.440 --> 04:47:12.440]  the State Department is looking
[04:47:12.440 --> 04:47:14.440]  and I appreciate your call here with the
[04:47:14.440 --> 04:47:16.440]  info
[04:47:16.440 --> 04:47:18.440]  at sending the UN in
[04:47:18.440 --> 04:47:20.440]  which will then be photo ops, just like New
[04:47:20.440 --> 04:47:22.440]  Orleans, they wouldn't let the troops
[04:47:22.440 --> 04:47:24.440]  or the National Guard
[04:47:24.440 --> 04:47:26.440]  or the
[04:47:26.440 --> 04:47:28.440]  Walmart or the Coast Guard
[04:47:28.440 --> 04:47:30.440]  help people. All they would
[04:47:30.440 --> 04:47:32.440]  do was send in federal troops to confiscate guns
[04:47:32.440 --> 04:47:34.440]  in high and dry areas as a
[04:47:34.440 --> 04:47:36.440]  gun confiscation drill, basically.
[04:47:36.440 --> 04:47:38.440]  And then Mexican troops
[04:47:38.440 --> 04:47:40.440]  were brought in
[04:47:40.440 --> 04:47:42.440]  to Texas and
[04:47:42.440 --> 04:47:44.440]  Mississippi, Louisiana as support
[04:47:44.440 --> 04:47:46.440]  role, so the message is only
[04:47:46.440 --> 04:47:48.440]  foreign troops can help you. The states
[04:47:48.440 --> 04:47:50.440]  can't. The states can't be
[04:47:50.440 --> 04:47:52.440]  trusted, but foreign governments
[04:47:52.440 --> 04:47:54.440]  can. As a
[04:47:54.440 --> 04:47:56.440]  Louisiana, in the middle of all
[04:47:56.440 --> 04:47:58.440]  this, after Katrina
[04:47:58.440 --> 04:48:00.440]  I mean, do you concur with
[04:48:00.440 --> 04:48:02.440]  what I just said or do you have any other facets you want
[04:48:02.440 --> 04:48:04.440]  to add to that or do you disagree?
[04:48:04.440 --> 04:48:06.440]  He's
[04:48:06.440 --> 04:48:08.440]  gone. Okay, I
[04:48:08.440 --> 04:48:10.440]  guess the code word, let people go, is
[04:48:10.440 --> 04:48:12.440]  thanks for the call. I did say thanks for the call,
[04:48:12.440 --> 04:48:14.440]  but I meant thanks for calling with this article.
[04:48:14.440 --> 04:48:16.440]  Call me back tomorrow
[04:48:16.440 --> 04:48:18.440]  because I've met that fella. He's a good talk show host down in New
[04:48:18.440 --> 04:48:20.440]  Orleans and I want to get his full breakdown
[04:48:20.440 --> 04:48:22.440]  on all this. That's a good place to
[04:48:22.440 --> 04:48:24.440]  close it out. This looks like
[04:48:24.440 --> 04:48:26.440]  they're turned into a huge United Nations
[04:48:26.440 --> 04:48:28.440]  Love Fest, you know, where, oh, thank
[04:48:28.440 --> 04:48:30.440]  God the UN came and I bet the
[04:48:30.440 --> 04:48:32.440]  UN even comes up with the idea of how to fix
[04:48:32.440 --> 04:48:34.440]  the leak. Yeah,
[04:48:34.440 --> 04:48:36.440]  what do you think, Lindsay Williams?
[04:48:36.440 --> 04:48:38.440]  Anything could happen at this point.
[04:48:38.440 --> 04:48:40.440]  I think it is anybody's guess what might
[04:48:40.440 --> 04:48:42.440]  take place. There's one thing for sure.
[04:48:42.440 --> 04:48:44.440]  Here, regardless of what happens,
[04:48:44.440 --> 04:48:46.440]  the elite are going
[04:48:46.440 --> 04:48:48.440]  to profit from what has happened.
[04:48:48.440 --> 04:48:50.440]  Amazing. Lindsay,
[04:48:50.440 --> 04:48:52.440]  I'm going to definitely talk to you again next
[04:48:52.440 --> 04:48:54.440]  week as this unfolds. God bless
[04:48:54.440 --> 04:48:56.440]  you and thanks for breaking your inside scoop
[04:48:56.440 --> 04:48:58.440]  here on The Air With Us. We'll talk to you soon.
[04:48:58.440 --> 04:49:00.440]  Thank you, Alex, and have a wonderful
[04:49:00.440 --> 04:49:02.440]  day. I appreciate the privilege
[04:49:02.440 --> 04:49:04.440]  of being on your show today. Oh, it's a privilege
[04:49:04.440 --> 04:49:06.440]  to have you on. God bless you and
[04:49:06.440 --> 04:49:08.440]  I don't really like to do more than four hours
[04:49:08.440 --> 04:49:10.440]  because I get a bit dingy.
[04:49:10.440 --> 04:49:12.440]  It's easy to talk in the first, second, third,
[04:49:12.440 --> 04:49:14.440]  fourth hour, but after that,
[04:49:14.440 --> 04:49:16.440]  I get a little bit punch drunk here on air.
[04:49:16.440 --> 04:49:18.440]  But I'll be recharged and back live
[04:49:18.440 --> 04:49:20.440]  11 a.m. Central, 12
[04:49:20.440 --> 04:49:22.440]  noon Eastern tomorrow and back Sunday
[04:49:22.440 --> 04:49:24.440]  4 to 6 p.m.
[04:49:24.440 --> 04:49:26.440]  But just so much crazy news.
[04:49:26.440 --> 04:49:28.440]  We'll continue to cover it all
[04:49:28.440 --> 04:49:30.440]  coming up
[04:49:30.440 --> 04:49:32.440]  in future transmissions
[04:49:32.440 --> 04:49:34.440]  and at infowars.com
[04:49:34.440 --> 04:49:36.440]  and
[04:49:36.440 --> 04:49:38.440]  prisenplanet.com. I want to say
[04:49:38.440 --> 04:49:40.440]  great job to the crew. I want to say great job
[04:49:40.440 --> 04:49:42.440]  to all the webmasters. Paul Watson, Curtin
[04:49:42.440 --> 04:49:44.440]  M. O. Steve Watson, Aaron Dykes
[04:49:44.440 --> 04:49:46.440]  all the people here in
[04:49:46.440 --> 04:49:48.440]  this office. They're doing a wonderful
[04:49:48.440 --> 04:49:50.440]  job. Phil and Matt Ryan
[04:49:50.440 --> 04:49:52.440]  and Matt
[04:49:52.440 --> 04:49:54.440]  and of course
[04:49:54.440 --> 04:49:56.440]  Jaren and just Craig
[04:49:56.440 --> 04:49:58.440]  everybody else. The entire office has done a great job
[04:49:58.440 --> 04:50:00.440]  our listeners, our sponsors, our affiliates
[04:50:00.440 --> 04:50:02.440]  and for all of you putting up with me
[04:50:02.440 --> 04:50:04.440]  until next time, Lord Willen
[04:50:04.440 --> 04:50:06.440]  we'll see you back here live
[04:50:06.440 --> 04:50:08.440]  coming up in about 19 hours
[04:50:08.440 --> 04:50:37.440]  by Kandiyos.
[04:50:38.440 --> 04:50:40.440]  Oh yeah!
[04:50:40.440 --> 04:50:42.440]  Victorious!
[04:50:42.440 --> 04:51:08.440]  Oh yeah! Victorious! Haha!
