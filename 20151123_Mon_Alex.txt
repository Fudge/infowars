[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:28.800]  the Big New Brzezinski's world dominating elitist management of Eurasia is completing
[00:28.800 --> 00:35.480]  its final maneuvers on the grand chessboard as the United States a hijacked world superpower
[00:35.480 --> 00:42.000]  government veers down the path to an engineered final endgame towards completion of a corporecratic
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.360]  new world order the primacy of the last remaining superpower i.e. the United States and the
[00:48.360 --> 00:52.880]  importance of destabilization in the Middle East and the acquisition of the wealth of
[00:52.880 --> 00:58.640]  Eurasia has reached its summit now the next phase is being unleashed on an unsuspecting
[00:58.640 --> 01:04.880]  populace in the words of Albert Pike satanist Ku Klux Klan founder and revered prophet of
[01:04.880 --> 01:11.120]  the new world order in the third world war we shall unleash the nihilists and the atheists
[01:11.120 --> 01:16.760]  and we shall provoke a formidable social cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly
[01:16.760 --> 01:22.680]  to the nations the effect of absolute atheism origin of savagery and of the most bloody
[01:22.680 --> 01:29.960]  turmoil then everywhere the citizens obliged to defend themselves against the world minority
[01:29.960 --> 01:35.600]  of revolutionaries will exterminate those destroyers of civilization and the multitude
[01:35.600 --> 01:40.760]  disillusioned with Christianity whose deist experience will from that moment be without
[01:40.760 --> 01:46.920]  compass or direction anxious for an ideal but without knowing where to render its adoration
[01:46.920 --> 01:53.160]  will receive the true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of Lucifer
[01:53.160 --> 01:58.480]  brought finally out in the public view this manifestation will result from the general
[01:58.480 --> 02:04.120]  reactionary movement which will follow the destruction of Christianity and atheism both
[02:04.120 --> 02:10.040]  conquered and exterminated at the same time upon those ashes the new world order of Albert
[02:10.040 --> 02:17.760]  Pike David Rockefeller George Soros the Bilderberg group the royalty of Europe the great work
[02:17.760 --> 02:24.000]  of the higher masonic orders they really are issues of the construction of a new world
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.160]  order will finally be established but there is always hope perhaps the mechanization of
[02:30.160 --> 02:35.720]  order out of chaos is beginning to cave in upon itself I think you're seeing in Europe
[02:35.720 --> 02:40.280]  the beginning of the end of the political correctness at least a correction in it I
[02:40.280 --> 02:46.960]  mean in Europe as I say that this one attack has done more to bring the EU to an end than
[02:46.960 --> 02:55.120]  I thought possible I think the EU is seeing a swing of the pendulum over to more conservative
[02:55.120 --> 03:02.320]  parties that want security that want to eliminate this multicultural nonsense this multicultural
[03:02.320 --> 03:08.720]  nightmare that Europe has become the loss of identity I mean you know Europe is becoming
[03:08.720 --> 03:15.080]  a Muslim nation and what they don't understand is that Islam reaches a critical per percentage
[03:15.080 --> 03:19.040]  eight percent during Sharia law it's about to get even more radical yes going to get
[03:19.040 --> 03:24.920]  more radical and they're going to try to align with the forces in the universities to do
[03:24.920 --> 03:31.000]  an air style revolution which will mean opening the borders rushing to the end of a new world
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.440]  order climate change all the things that Obama has predicted will want to do he's going to
[03:36.440 --> 03:42.400]  rush to do is going to fail I think there will be more terrorist attacks in Europe I
[03:42.400 --> 03:45.800]  think there's going to be terrorist attacks in the United States you're going to see more
[03:45.800 --> 03:50.920]  and more terrorists stopped at the border you're going to see more and more criminal activity
[03:50.920 --> 03:57.560]  the country is going to close the border and the country may start throwing out Muslims
[03:57.560 --> 04:04.480]  in Europe in the United States if Obama continues to press this agenda the Clinton Foundation
[04:04.480 --> 04:09.680]  is in its last days it will be put under receivership by one or more of the states Clinton will
[04:09.680 --> 04:15.360]  lose control of the foundation and the Democratic party will move far to the left for those
[04:15.360 --> 04:21.560]  of you out there still with doubt just know this everything is going according to plan

[08:24.640 --> 08:30.400]  property and family values and it really hit me this weekend that everything comes down
[08:30.400 --> 08:39.640]  to the loss of chivalry the loss of honor there's a paradox growing up in texas sharing
[08:39.640 --> 08:44.920]  how great texas is and how texas is the best in the cult of texas you kind of rebel against
[08:44.920 --> 08:50.000]  that when you're 13 14 15 years old and get sick of it until i traveled around other parts
[08:50.000 --> 08:55.460]  of the country in the world and then i realized that some of the traits of texas though overwritten
[08:55.460 --> 09:02.740]  to a great extent were the end of chivalry and that's why from japan to england to russia
[09:02.740 --> 09:09.400]  many historians wrote about the noble activities that took place in texas and also some of
[09:09.400 --> 09:16.680]  the barbarous free-booting piratical activities as well let's just say it resembled robert
[09:16.680 --> 09:25.840]  e howards conan the barbarian for real not in fantasy land in the hiberian age that said
[09:25.840 --> 09:30.680]  the same thing with the military all the military is the best all the veterans of the best all
[09:30.680 --> 09:36.840]  the troops of the best oh i recognized early on it was propaganda i recognized early on
[09:36.840 --> 09:42.440]  it was to get people to join the military to be abused and used i was told that by people
[09:42.440 --> 09:47.880]  that were in the military but then as i got older and more sophisticated i realized it's
[09:47.880 --> 09:55.160]  the stolen glory of the tyrants who use the military for the wrong reasons and who then
[09:55.160 --> 10:00.520]  abuse the military afterwards because these dishonorable cowards fear the men and the
[10:00.520 --> 10:06.920]  women who are willing to go in harm's way and even if they joined as poor nobodies they
[10:06.920 --> 10:14.680]  in many cases become somebody because as victor hugo famously said adversity makes men
[10:14.680 --> 10:23.080]  prosperity makes monsters and so so many things in this world are a paradox in that the military
[10:23.080 --> 10:29.320]  is our doom the military is our savior the police are our doom they're our savior state
[10:29.320 --> 10:34.760]  governments and the federal government are our doom it's also our savior because they're just
[10:34.760 --> 10:42.920]  institutions that we must take control of through the system and we must do it through ideas because
[10:42.920 --> 10:49.080]  our ideas are so much stronger so much more real so much more beautiful so much more empowering
[10:49.080 --> 10:59.480]  so much sexier fiery lightning bolts explosions creativity compared to what the new world orders
[10:59.480 --> 11:05.320]  serve it up that if we just take the field in the animating contest of liberty we will win
[11:06.760 --> 11:13.080]  in our early defeats we will grow stronger and we'll have martyrs and heroes not physical martyrs
[11:13.080 --> 11:20.360]  of death in some cases but martyrs in the info war individuals destroyed annihilated torn apart
[11:20.360 --> 11:27.400]  discredited by the enemy but only to be resurrected like the phoenix as the system is discredited
[11:29.320 --> 11:38.280]  we live in magical epic legendary over the top exciting fantastical wondrous times
[11:38.280 --> 11:46.120]  the great contest for the future destiny of humanity is before us
[11:49.400 --> 11:58.520]  and it's up to all of us of every race color and creed from every region to really ask are we
[11:58.520 --> 12:05.640]  patriots for humanity are we fans of humanity are we fans of the human collective experience
[12:05.640 --> 12:13.960]  we've shared together individual collectivism a term I coined many years ago where we are individualist
[12:13.960 --> 12:18.600]  and believe in the individual and the rugged individual but then collectively through shared
[12:18.600 --> 12:28.280]  culture and ideas create a collective masterpiece of true vibrant explosive beautiful diversity
[12:28.280 --> 12:36.360]  then I look at what the so-called keepers of the flame of diversity and renaissance
[12:36.360 --> 12:41.320]  and ideas who they are they're the people that want to ban mother and father he and she
[12:42.040 --> 12:44.920]  they're the ones that want to spew racial division all day long
[12:47.880 --> 12:52.760]  they're the ones that want to teach our children how to in fight and be stupid and sabotage humans
[12:52.760 --> 12:58.680]  for life so they never develop and go through rites of passage I look at full grown men
[13:00.840 --> 13:03.160]  who've never been through any real rites of passage
[13:05.320 --> 13:13.400]  and I see the rest of development and I see them manipulated into false paradigms of kinship
[13:13.400 --> 13:23.880]  and it's very very sad to see them stunted you see the new world order can't succeed if there are men
[13:26.200 --> 13:33.720]  it can't succeed if there are real women it can't succeed unless you are frozen
[13:33.720 --> 13:44.440]  in a junior high level of about 12 years old and that is the greatest crime of our enemies
[13:44.440 --> 13:49.320]  because they consciously know what they're doing they have the knowledge of good and evil
[13:50.040 --> 13:55.480]  and they choose to use the psychosis of evil of twisted thinking
[13:55.480 --> 14:08.840]  of diseased algorithms to create sick cultures that they can govern because noble honorable
[14:09.400 --> 14:21.640]  upright visionary systems are free and the fire the blood that courses through its arteries
[14:21.640 --> 14:30.120]  that pulses through its heart is free will is creativity and the spark of the mind of God
[14:30.680 --> 14:36.920]  given to us made in the image of the creator of the universe
[14:39.720 --> 14:44.680]  that's why humans are targeted by the technocrats who see themselves as a breakaway species
[14:45.320 --> 14:48.840]  you know I was the first the last 20 years to tell you that was their plan
[14:48.840 --> 14:53.960]  now you see it wire magazine you see it the london guardian you see it everywhere this is their
[14:53.960 --> 15:02.200]  great delusion they believe they're going to become the uber mention they're going to become
[15:02.200 --> 15:13.720]  the god men the hercules the return of the hercules when no true herculanean would try to
[15:13.720 --> 15:19.640]  suppress their fellow man and dumb them down because a true herculanean builds other people
[15:19.640 --> 15:29.720]  up the globalist claim they're going to give us the fields of elysium when that is the vision
[15:29.720 --> 15:41.880]  of the ancients only now beginning to become realizable and I tell you you will not find the
[15:41.880 --> 15:50.040]  promised land new world order you are only here to test those of us that are chosen who will go to
[15:50.040 --> 15:55.800]  the promised land of advanced technology life extension space colonies and the next level
[15:55.800 --> 15:59.480]  and your infiltration of the controlled churches to have people thinking it's the end of the world
[15:59.480 --> 16:05.160]  every five minutes so they stand down and don't take action ease your greatest work and more and
[16:05.160 --> 16:12.360]  more I think upon that fact to create the films to write the books to put out the material to
[16:12.360 --> 16:17.000]  expose the great fraud of that because even if you believe the tribulation is six months away
[16:17.000 --> 16:28.040]  or a thousand years away or a thousand worlds away you will not be accepted into the kingdom of
[16:28.040 --> 16:34.600]  heaven that you're in you're in space my friends you're on an incredible planet you're here you
[16:34.600 --> 16:40.520]  will not be accepted in the kingdom of heaven if you don't have the spirit to want to warn people
[16:40.520 --> 16:51.080]  and expose evil if you don't have that burning in your heart the desire to free your fellow humans
[16:51.080 --> 16:58.360]  and free yourself and to pull down and tear down the enemy and to stomp them underfoot
[16:58.360 --> 17:06.920]  then you're already dead you've already succumbed to the enemy
[17:16.120 --> 17:22.760]  because all these articles all these pieces of fact all these pieces of information all these
[17:22.760 --> 17:35.560]  twisted pieces of rose-colored darkness in the sum quantity are only a reflection of what this
[17:35.560 --> 17:46.120]  system has built on the bones of human creativity and it's nothing but a stinking fraud when you
[17:46.120 --> 17:54.680]  look into the new world order you see that everything it does is nothing but a vandalistic
[17:55.400 --> 18:01.720]  murderous hatred of life and of free will and of the creative spark
[18:05.160 --> 18:10.200]  that from birth beats in all of our hearts and minds and spirits
[18:10.200 --> 18:15.400]  and the enemy comes to steal
[18:18.440 --> 18:27.720]  that light in the dark of the night so that the false light of the enemy can be held up
[18:27.720 --> 18:34.440]  to the throngs and so they will bow to that false god and have their free will destroyed
[18:34.440 --> 18:42.680]  and be turned into basically walking dead that's the archetype of the zombie that's been made
[18:42.680 --> 18:49.640]  so popular thrown in our face as the military trains to wipe out zombie wave attacks at military
[18:49.640 --> 18:58.200]  bases they have people dressed up in human wave attacks mainly like farmers and then they rush
[18:58.200 --> 19:03.960]  the marines they rush the army it's on the news they mow everyone down and no one asked we were
[19:03.960 --> 19:11.480]  just trained to mow down fellow americans in mass i know that's an elementary statement of their
[19:11.480 --> 19:18.360]  propaganda but man that's just one little point of it and i look at their propaganda i see it all
[19:18.360 --> 19:25.320]  i see the formula x the stamps the standards the logos the programming the subliminals all of it
[19:25.320 --> 19:34.280]  and when you stare into it you see the mind behind it and it's not of this world
[19:36.600 --> 19:40.760]  oh it's the god of this world but it fell to this world
[19:42.360 --> 19:49.960]  now when you realize you're up against an entity you realize the only answer is to tie in
[19:49.960 --> 19:57.560]  to the creator of that entity and then there's no contest the news is straight ahead
[20:01.160 --> 20:07.080]  earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us have had that moment
[20:07.080 --> 20:11.640]  when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing we
[20:11.640 --> 20:16.680]  start with food storage then we address the need for water but have you considered heat storage
[20:16.680 --> 20:21.160]  i'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider
[20:21.160 --> 20:25.640]  how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the
[20:25.640 --> 20:31.320]  problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another concern
[20:31.320 --> 20:35.720]  there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may
[20:35.720 --> 20:40.920]  even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly than you
[20:40.920 --> 20:46.760]  think for these answers go to fortress clothing dot com again fortress clothing dot com has the
[20:46.760 --> 20:53.000]  answers to your heat storage dilemma don't get stuck in the cold fortress clothing dot com

[25:28.520 --> 25:32.840]  i have a stack of news here just just just one of only about eight stacks today
[25:34.920 --> 25:41.080]  i have a stack just on isis in warfare and terrorism from mainstream alternative government
[25:41.080 --> 25:46.520]  announcements raw videos you name it i mean i could literally talk for the entire hour on one of these
[25:46.520 --> 25:55.080]  stories in fact one of these stories is that drudge report dot com right now it's a info wars
[25:55.080 --> 26:03.560]  dot com article and it's from defense link do d news i saw some comments saying i don't believe
[26:03.560 --> 26:08.200]  this you know uh on another site that we posted our article this morning i actually saw it not
[26:08.200 --> 26:12.760]  from our side with somebody else's for some reason in my email i was like oh that's info wars
[26:12.760 --> 26:18.360]  and people are commenting going what's the proof of this yeah there's like this default when
[26:18.360 --> 26:25.240]  something's outrageous that people didn't say it must not be true it's do d news you might have heard
[26:25.240 --> 26:33.720]  of that that's the department of defense news very very frustrating but uh that's the story
[26:33.720 --> 26:39.080]  within the story white house gave isis 45 minute warning before bombing oil tankers
[26:39.080 --> 26:44.680]  that's like defense news now admits our government helps grow the opium in afghanistan
[26:44.680 --> 26:48.200]  because the answer is don't let investigative reporters show it then it's a big story just
[26:48.200 --> 26:56.440]  just admit it on c nbc nbc cnn and fox all the same week right after they killed pat tillman
[26:57.400 --> 27:01.160]  pat tillman was right known about the drug dealing and he wasn't going to be part of it and so they
[27:01.160 --> 27:05.800]  they killed him they murdered him that came out to the army colonels credit he said that you know
[27:05.800 --> 27:12.920]  in the autopsy he was murdered and so a couple weeks after that happened they just went on the
[27:12.920 --> 27:18.200]  news and said we grow the opium because they knew the trips were right in home was a big scandal
[27:18.200 --> 27:23.960]  because they were denying it see now you just go yeah we're going to teach your five-year-olds
[27:23.960 --> 27:28.920]  how to masturbate in public school we're just going to do it we're going to forcibly inoculate
[27:28.920 --> 27:34.360]  them too because your kids don't belong to you and two plus two by the way does equal five
[27:34.360 --> 27:41.720]  or you're a racist and we're going to bound brown paperbacks white house gave ices 45 minute
[27:41.720 --> 27:47.800]  warning before bombing oil tankers why did it take 15 months for the u.s to target the islamic
[27:47.800 --> 27:51.960]  states oil infrastructure and of course it was funny to make fun of us and make fun of donald
[27:51.960 --> 27:56.600]  trump and we said this was the thing to do day one i mean it's a no-brainer if somebody's selling
[27:56.600 --> 28:03.640]  oil and making billions of dollars off of it 800 plus million they've sold just to uh turkey
[28:03.640 --> 28:06.520]  oh our gallant ally turkey i forgot
[28:11.320 --> 28:14.600]  and so only after the russians blew most of it up would they then start
[28:15.400 --> 28:19.400]  claiming they're bombing some of the trucks but then they they warned them to get out of the trucks
[28:19.400 --> 28:26.280]  first and the argument is well these are civilians no they're not they're in a war zone
[28:26.280 --> 28:34.440]  driving stolen oil to the turkish border did our truckers in iraq getting bombed by al-qaeda
[28:34.440 --> 28:39.800]  which is ices today did our civilian truckers get warnings when they're getting bought up on those
[28:39.800 --> 28:46.040]  roads did our military even try to claim that was a war crime targeting civilians no they didn't
[28:46.040 --> 28:50.360]  because they're delivering munitions and fuel they're in the war effort they're a target
[28:50.360 --> 28:56.760]  it under international law obama is violating the rules of war because he doesn't really want
[28:56.760 --> 29:02.840]  to target him and that's what we've done the whole time so there it is and that's from
[29:03.560 --> 29:06.360]  the department of defense news because again they just put it in your face that's a tactic
[29:06.360 --> 29:13.800]  they engage in okay that's one article out of probably 40 and we're going to cover these when
[29:13.800 --> 29:24.200]  we come back but a pro-refugee leftist rally in paris attack the police and it's french just walking
[29:24.200 --> 29:29.240]  up and punching police in the face and throwing things at them this is mainly a european french
[29:29.240 --> 29:37.240]  audience a european french group of self-loving suicidal moron fruit cakes in my view and by the
[29:37.240 --> 29:42.280]  way uh the rest of story when we come back demonstrations are banned in france but they let
[29:42.280 --> 29:46.280]  the leftists do it but if you're a conservative group they arrest you we'll be right back
[29:47.960 --> 29:54.680]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[29:58.600 --> 30:03.640]  hamtramik michigan is experiencing culture shock after becoming the first majority muslim city in
[30:03.640 --> 30:08.120]  the us for example business owners routinely advertise their products in arabic and they
[30:08.120 --> 30:13.800]  can't obtain liquor licenses within 500 feet of a mosque but besides his cultural shift hamtramik
[30:13.800 --> 30:19.080]  also serves as a microcosm of america's economy hamtramik was the home of a chrysler automobile
[30:19.080 --> 30:24.120]  plant back during the muscle car era of the 60s and early 70s everything for implinus barracudas
[30:24.120 --> 30:28.200]  the dodge charges were built at the hamtramik plant but now the plants closed down just like
[30:28.200 --> 30:33.240]  america's manufacturing base when the us dollar was chosen as the international medium of exchange
[30:33.240 --> 30:38.120]  decades ago the us still had a strong manufacturing base but now it does it and the only reason why
[30:38.120 --> 30:42.440]  we're still able to maintain a trade deficit is due to global demand for the dollar but eventually
[30:42.440 --> 30:46.600]  other countries will stop accepting dollars for their products because we barely manufacture
[30:46.600 --> 30:50.760]  anything anymore and one that happens the us economy will close down just like the hamtramik
[30:50.760 --> 30:55.160]  automobile plant did so many years ago this is kit daniels and visit info wars dot com and

[33:35.800 --> 33:41.560]  or asked that question or the other question who's a bigger listener george straighter jeff
[33:41.560 --> 33:54.360]  bridges that's another question let's listen to george straight just for a minute
[34:01.400 --> 34:08.360]  i ain't got a dime but what i got is mine that's enough for matt mariella by morning
[34:08.360 --> 34:15.800]  rich but lord i'm free i'm not name dropping um i've been told by several big musicians that
[34:15.800 --> 34:19.240]  oh yeah george straight likes your show first time about a decade ago then once the ace in the
[34:19.240 --> 34:23.960]  whole band was playing another musician's birthday party that's that's his band but george straight
[34:23.960 --> 34:28.200]  wasn't there and i was told that and then i was actually told that again i've never really even
[34:28.200 --> 34:31.960]  reached out to george straight i'm not even name dropping right now i'm just wanting folks to know
[34:31.960 --> 34:37.960]  how popular the liberty movement is and how many cool people in culture don't get political
[34:37.960 --> 34:43.160]  but are awake and then of course i know that i'm not going to get into any of the private
[34:43.160 --> 34:46.680]  details but jeff bridges is a big listener and i just think jeff bridges is really cool and
[34:46.680 --> 34:50.200]  really like him he's a great actor haven't even reached out to him yet i think i will you know
[34:50.200 --> 34:56.760]  vego mortensen's been on many others that said speaking about who's awake and who isn't i was
[34:56.760 --> 35:02.520]  told by again three different prominent people over the years how much lance armstrong hates me
[35:02.520 --> 35:10.120]  and living here in austin i knew some and we're not a celebrity show it's just interesting that
[35:10.120 --> 35:15.880]  different people's views on someone like myself covering what's happening in the world i mean
[35:15.880 --> 35:21.160]  why would lance armstrong hate me and then of course my mom used to be a triathlete and a
[35:21.160 --> 35:24.680]  master swimmer and she won gold medals and stuff like that she would she'd do it when she was young
[35:24.680 --> 35:28.680]  she got into when she was like 30 but she did compete with formerlympians and stuff and she was
[35:28.680 --> 35:32.440]  you know really doing good because she took a flu shot when she was 50 something almost killed her and
[35:32.440 --> 35:36.840]  then that knocked her out of competition forever uh but i just might want to take a flu shot so
[35:36.840 --> 35:41.240]  folks they're so great my mom was in bed for a month used to win gold medals and silver medals
[35:41.240 --> 35:47.400]  at like the state level you know in in in swimming and triathlons and that never could
[35:47.400 --> 35:51.560]  basically do it again after that she still lifts weights and exercises but i'm digressing
[35:51.560 --> 35:55.400]  she was friends with some folks and the wife of lance armstrong and so i mean she was in the
[35:55.400 --> 36:02.200]  lance armstrong box at some of the turd of france stuff uh with my dad and sister i'm not name dropping
[36:02.200 --> 36:06.520]  on that point and i heard back then when they knew him they didn't want to say bad things about
[36:06.520 --> 36:12.120]  lance armstrong what an egomaniac narcissist demon he was but when he left his wife i then got to hear
[36:12.120 --> 36:17.800]  all about it and but i never talked about lance armstrong because i don't care then he got caught
[36:17.800 --> 36:22.920]  lying about everything going over all this stuff but i gotta say this morning i finally after all
[36:22.920 --> 36:28.920]  these years in austin ran into lance armstrong it was weird i was out jogging up a hill in the middle
[36:28.920 --> 36:33.800]  of nowhere with pat riley my personal trainer who just goes out with me and jogs and then has me do
[36:33.800 --> 36:37.960]  sit-ups and push-ups he stretches me and stuff because that's more important than even the exercise
[36:38.840 --> 36:43.960]  and uh i look back and there's lance armstrong running up and he runs right by me he looks at
[36:43.960 --> 36:48.440]  me and then tells pat excuse me and goes around him and i gotta say he kind of looks goofy looking
[36:48.440 --> 36:55.240]  on tv and stuff he was had a presence it was pretty scary in person i mean i actually stepped back
[36:55.240 --> 36:59.800]  when he ran six inches by me and looked right in my eyes i was like whoa that you know you run around
[36:59.800 --> 37:05.080]  you know run into some people they got kind of a presence uh and i definitely had an interesting
[37:05.080 --> 37:11.720]  presence uh to him and basically almost got run over by him so there is the lance armstrong story
[37:11.720 --> 37:16.280]  and i don't know why i just told you a george straight story i don't know why i just told you
[37:16.280 --> 37:20.760]  a jeff bridge's story i don't know why i just told you a lance armstrong story it's just free flowing
[37:20.760 --> 37:24.840]  consciousness here today i'm procrastinating getting into all this news talking to paul watson
[37:24.840 --> 37:30.440]  getting the latest update on europe and the situation there other attacks and joe biggs and
[37:30.440 --> 37:35.480]  michaels emmerman are back from uh france and england they're going to be in studio uh with us at the
[37:35.480 --> 37:40.200]  bottom of the hour we're going to open the phones up today as well but i guess the reason i got into
[37:40.200 --> 37:44.760]  that was multi-fold number one i want you know there's a lot of really cool awesome people i mean
[37:44.760 --> 37:51.880]  of course george straight's a patriot i mean it'd be it'd be of sin if he wasn't that's just a default
[37:51.880 --> 37:56.840]  of course jeff bridges is so cool he's got to be you know in fact the new world order uh you know
[37:56.840 --> 38:03.000]  just he just kind of d and then of course lance armstrong is a jerk and anytime my name comes up
[38:03.000 --> 38:08.760]  he just talks about how horrible i am and how stupid i am and uh how much he hates me and you
[38:08.760 --> 38:14.600]  know what that was years before he he got disgraced so it's like it's so of course lance armstrong
[38:14.600 --> 38:20.920]  doesn't like me i mean that just is so fitting isn't it jeff bridges does george straight does
[38:20.920 --> 38:25.880]  you know the former head of pakistani intelligence who just died on me gull and all these and matt
[38:25.880 --> 38:31.800]  drudge and it's countless cool people and i'm not up here bragging but i've been realizing that we
[38:31.800 --> 38:37.960]  need to celebrate more how popular the liberty movement is because i sit there and look at msnbc
[38:37.960 --> 38:45.960]  and in salon media matters la times new york times new york magazine all of them i mean
[38:45.960 --> 38:51.480]  hundreds of others lying about us demonizing us attacking us saying nobody listens saying we're
[38:51.480 --> 38:56.920]  cooked saying we're not popular saying we're losing the culture war because they're losing
[38:57.560 --> 39:03.800]  they're not the real liberals they're frauds and they're in a culture war to make libertarians
[39:03.800 --> 39:10.360]  patriots paleo conservatives and just common sense people look like bitter clinger you know
[39:10.360 --> 39:17.080]  hillbillies and they're these gods you know up there on mount olympus well i'd rather hang around
[39:17.080 --> 39:20.200]  with an old hillbilly that works for a living than hang around with a bunch of you fake plastic
[39:20.200 --> 39:27.560]  people i'll tell you that right now and i am extremely extremely honored that there are so
[39:27.560 --> 39:32.360]  many great artists and minds and political people and again nine out of ten that contact me over the
[39:32.360 --> 39:38.520]  years will not come on the show i'm not going to get into the whole story about it but brad pit
[39:38.520 --> 39:45.000]  is aware of the new world order brad pit is a big fan of uh erin rusos how i got introduced to it
[39:45.000 --> 39:50.200]  freedom to fascism at least he was look at his wife at the un look at what brad pit pushes
[39:51.560 --> 39:56.520]  it's just crazy and i happen to know a lot of these guys you see on tv pushing un causes and
[39:56.520 --> 40:03.160]  liberal causes and stuff it's a big joke to them they all know it's pure bull and just go along with
[40:03.160 --> 40:08.120]  it so they get pushed out there in front of everybody i'm not going to name names here but
[40:09.000 --> 40:21.560]  it's despicable it's despicable and that's what this comes down to is that it's really uncool
[40:21.560 --> 40:27.480]  to support the globalist it's really uncool to support the un it's really uncool to be involved
[40:27.480 --> 40:33.160]  in any of this new order stuff because it's all super evil super oppressive super out of control
[40:33.160 --> 40:41.640]  and anti-human and the big news is there's been a revolution in media in hollywood and in many other
[40:41.640 --> 40:48.360]  sectors in the corporate world you name it people are dividing up which sides they're on
[40:48.360 --> 40:54.520]  and folks don't think it's cuckoo you talk about world government and cybernetics control
[40:55.160 --> 40:58.840]  and all this other stuff that we've been breaking down because see it's all starting to come true
[40:58.840 --> 41:03.000]  but we were just reading white papers i didn't really do much anything and neither did other
[41:03.000 --> 41:07.800]  patriots except care and we're not doing this because we're heroes folks we're doing it for
[41:07.800 --> 41:14.360]  self-preservation if you're a fan of humanity and want free will and you want renaissance and
[41:14.360 --> 41:19.720]  enlightenment you're on the side of humanity you're a patriot a planetary patriot
[41:22.440 --> 41:25.800]  a go-getter a team player a lover of life a lover of liberty
[41:27.560 --> 41:31.880]  if you're on the other side you get off on screwing people over keeping people in the dark
[41:31.880 --> 41:35.880]  controlling a bunch of mindless idiots and to me that's the ultimate sin
[41:39.160 --> 41:42.280]  targeting the childlike minds of people instead of trying to enlighten them
[41:42.280 --> 41:47.720]  and i know it's frustrating to try to talk to people that have a spark of intelligence but
[41:47.720 --> 41:52.200]  not the full understanding because then they will get angry at you because they're trying to help
[41:52.200 --> 41:59.320]  them along they're like a drowning person i get it but that is our burden and it's a burden that
[41:59.320 --> 42:04.680]  has to be carried out the mainstream media today attacks the enlightenment and calls it the white
[42:04.680 --> 42:12.440]  man's burden rutger kippling called it that but before that it wasn't called the white man's burden
[42:13.880 --> 42:18.840]  it was called enlightenment it was called renaissance and it had nothing to do with
[42:18.840 --> 42:24.920]  what color you were and it tied into understandings of other cultures and other groups from around
[42:24.920 --> 42:31.400]  the world and sought to build up humanity and empower people because if you're not trying to
[42:31.400 --> 42:38.120]  empower others you are satanic and fallen period period
[42:41.560 --> 42:45.560]  and so i'm just getting into philosophy today about what this comes down to
[42:50.040 --> 42:54.520]  paul watson's joining us until the hour ends and then i will get at the start of the hour into
[42:54.520 --> 42:59.400]  the stacks of news i mean look at these headlines white house gives ices 45 minute warning before

[46:43.560 --> 46:51.320]  range all right paul joseph watson joining us from her britannic majesties all beyond
[46:52.120 --> 46:57.880]  london england paul so much has happened i just wanted to get you on in retrospective what you
[46:57.880 --> 47:01.720]  reported on from france last week and other big breaking news and your story on drudge
[47:01.720 --> 47:07.320]  report dot com watt house gave ices 45 minute warning before bombing oil tankers and and
[47:07.320 --> 47:13.000]  now obama's in the news saying okay i'm gonna up my rhetoric a little bit against ices i mean this
[47:13.000 --> 47:19.000]  is truly sickening well yeah he's basically saying that everybody needs to chill out and that ices
[47:19.000 --> 47:24.760]  is not a threat well you know he's been chilling out for about 15 months now because that's the
[47:24.760 --> 47:32.120]  time period in which the u.s. has not targeted ices oil refineries or ices oil tankers now
[47:32.120 --> 47:39.240]  bearing in mind over 50 percent of ices's activities is funded by this black market oil
[47:39.240 --> 47:47.160]  revenue and they have nice and 16s from america yeah so 15 months without any u.s. airstrikes on
[47:47.160 --> 47:53.720]  these oil fields of course russia went in and within five days destroyed more than 1000 tankers
[47:53.720 --> 47:59.880]  the first and only u.s. strike on these oil tankers which is financing ices's whole operation
[47:59.880 --> 48:07.400]  took out 117 tanker trucks so way behind russia already and of course why is this well as we've
[48:07.400 --> 48:13.160]  documented for years the pentagon and this came out in their own documents foresaw the rise of a
[48:13.160 --> 48:19.640]  quote salafist principality in other words ices and they said that that would ensue as a result
[48:19.640 --> 48:25.400]  of arming these jihadist rebels who are not moderate rebels even though the media describes them
[48:25.400 --> 48:31.240]  that's still every single day so they knew but by arming these rebels many of whom defected to ices
[48:31.240 --> 48:36.600]  many of whom gave their weapons to ices that it would lead to the growth of ices and that would
[48:36.600 --> 48:43.000]  help destabilize president bashar al-asad which has been the agenda all along that's why they left
[48:43.000 --> 48:49.720]  the oil supplies alone for 15 months because they knew that ices couldn't take over parts of iraq and
[48:49.720 --> 48:55.720]  syria without that massive financing so now this article that's linked up on drudge report
[48:56.360 --> 49:02.040]  they're getting a 45 minute warning before the us airstrikes these oil tankers and of course
[49:02.040 --> 49:07.880]  the excuse is oh we want to prevent civilian casualties which of course didn't apply when
[49:07.880 --> 49:12.840]  they struck the hospital no that allows them to then park the trucks and this is what's not on the
[49:12.840 --> 49:17.880]  story i would add it i know this tactic it allows them to park the trucks inside mosques inside
[49:17.880 --> 49:22.920]  facilities where then they're no go for strikes so they can then tell the pilots you can't target
[49:22.920 --> 49:27.320]  so you said they don't want to tell the pilots you can't target because they get upset and it
[49:27.320 --> 49:32.120]  causes a rebellion because then the military starts reporting back that it's all staged as
[49:32.120 --> 49:36.600]  pilots have gone public and already told us six months ago so that's what they're really doing
[49:36.600 --> 49:42.520]  here is allowing them to attack most of these tankers and cash them yeah and as he said these
[49:42.520 --> 49:48.120]  us military pilots have come forward and said they're not allowed to drop 75 percent of their
[49:48.120 --> 49:53.080]  ordinance on ices targets because they're not getting clearance from their superiors so they've
[49:53.080 --> 49:58.040]  got this window of opportunity to wipe them out completely they're being called back they're being
[49:58.040 --> 50:03.640]  told not to deploy their full ordinance again because this policy has been from the very start
[50:03.640 --> 50:09.000]  and it's not a conspiracy here it's in their own documents to allow the rise of ices to act as a
[50:09.000 --> 50:15.000]  destabilizing force against us that's council on foreign relations three years ago yeah supporting
[50:15.000 --> 50:20.040]  these al-qaeda groups which are not moderate which rip people's hearts out and eat them on camera
[50:20.040 --> 50:25.400]  which behead people which force children to behead people defect to ices give their weapons to ices
[50:25.400 --> 50:30.760]  and that helps isolate as well gloria steinham says the word mother and father is the problem
[50:30.760 --> 50:37.400]  well yeah and then you've got the leftist of course saying that any criticism of islam
[50:37.400 --> 50:43.720]  is anti-american that's their big meme now again the so-called tolerant left is tolerating the most
[50:43.720 --> 50:49.640]  intolerant religion on the planet which we can get into after the break i'm skipping the break paul
[50:49.640 --> 50:56.840]  please continue yeah so my frustration basically is the inability of the left and right to hold
[50:56.840 --> 51:03.720]  two thoughts in their head at the same time so yes bombing the middle east this geopolitical
[51:03.720 --> 51:09.400]  policy that's been in place for the past 15 20 years stirring up the nest is a vacuum for al-qaeda
[51:09.400 --> 51:14.840]  is wrong but now that we're facing al-qaeda aka ices we have to take them out sorry paul go ahead i
[51:14.840 --> 51:21.480]  won't shut up yeah so bombing the middle east radicalizes populations that's proven and it
[51:21.480 --> 51:27.320]  creates terrorists let's stop doing that let's stop overthrowing secular governments like
[51:27.320 --> 51:33.400]  colonel goddafi like bashar al-asad and empowering jihadists to take over the entire region and then
[51:33.400 --> 51:39.480]  slip back into europe's refugees and carry out attacks on innocent people let's stop doing that
[51:39.480 --> 51:45.960]  but let's also acknowledge the fact that islam is a violent religion and many and it's not a
[51:45.960 --> 51:51.960]  tiny minority again you mentioned the paul earlier one in five british muslims support jihadists going
[51:51.960 --> 51:57.560]  over to fight in syria and you know the islamic state said it after the paris attack they said
[51:57.560 --> 52:03.320]  they attacked paris because in their own words it was a center of quote prostitution and vice
[52:03.320 --> 52:10.360]  so then you go into the karan again this is not a misinterpretation this is not a radical minority
[52:10.360 --> 52:15.560]  this is in the karan quote the penalty for those who strive upon earth to cause corruption
[52:15.560 --> 52:21.080]  is that they be killed or crucified again isis said they attack paris because they saw it as a
[52:21.080 --> 52:25.960]  center of prostitution and vice so they're taking that but then they're totally hypocritical and
[52:25.960 --> 52:30.520]  the head of all this radical islamo hobbyist literally kidnaps women and takes them and puts
[52:30.520 --> 52:37.800]  them in slave harems and his hell on earth and women are sex slaves it's just it it literally
[52:37.800 --> 52:44.680]  is planet scum ball exactly so we need to hold those two thoughts in our head at the same time
[52:44.680 --> 52:50.120]  can we do that again more of these polls i've got a 10 minute video called the truth about islam
[52:50.120 --> 52:54.360]  that's being posted in about an hour which goes through all this and if i don't get more death
[52:54.360 --> 52:59.320]  threats then i'm not doing my job properly but i guess nothing's as frightening as you know walking
[52:59.320 --> 53:06.280]  through the jihadist capital of europe but an icm poll for example found that 16 percent of french
[53:06.280 --> 53:14.920]  citizens support isis 18 to 24 that age group 27 percent of young french people support isis
[53:14.920 --> 53:20.920]  they had a survey on al jazeera arabic television which of course is watched by sunni muslims living
[53:20.920 --> 53:28.360]  in the arab world 81 supported isis again there are more than there are double the amount of
[53:28.360 --> 53:35.560]  british muslims fighting for isis than are fighting for the british army so this is not a tiny minority
[53:35.560 --> 53:42.440]  of radicals this ideology appeals to a broad base because in the caran it's not a conspiracy theory
[53:42.440 --> 53:47.720]  there are numerous passages i enlist some of them in this video which directly call on people
[53:47.720 --> 53:53.160]  to behead you know chop the feet off the hands off of the infidels who cause corruption in the
[53:53.160 --> 53:59.400]  land which is exactly what isis does have slave harems with hundreds of kidnapped women yeah
[53:59.400 --> 54:07.080]  and again the left is tolerant of intolerance again we have stonings we have gay people being
[54:07.080 --> 54:13.240]  thrown up buildings female genital mutilation and the left comes out you know if the wesperer
[54:13.240 --> 54:18.840]  baptist church of some extreme right wing group was advocating that the left would be all over it
[54:18.840 --> 54:24.600]  if christians were going out and slaughtering people in the name of jesus what would the left
[54:24.600 --> 54:30.840]  say but again this proves that the so-called progressive left is in fact completely regressive
[54:30.840 --> 54:35.160]  they are totalitarian attempting to overthrow the new renaissance
[54:37.160 --> 54:43.160]  exactly and it's it's it's the hip hop they want to destroy sir frances bacon's new atlantis they
[54:43.160 --> 54:51.640]  are the devil and then again you come at it from a geopolitical angle turkey okay we had the video
[54:51.640 --> 54:57.240]  a few days ago the turkish fans booing the minute silence for the paris victims so then again the
[54:57.240 --> 55:02.680]  left the young turks come out and say they weren't booing the minute silence they were just chanting
[55:02.680 --> 55:07.480]  for for the martyrs of course they were booing the minute sound the whole point of the minute
[55:07.480 --> 55:13.000]  silence is to remain silent they're jeering they're whistling they're booing throughout it
[55:13.000 --> 55:20.680]  and the left even makes excuses for that despicable behavior you know turkey is 99 percent muslim we
[55:20.680 --> 55:25.560]  have the same thing in azerbaijan how do you stop calling them liberals and i and i'm not on you
[55:25.560 --> 55:31.720]  about this but but listen i get it we got to call them liberals because that's how we identify them
[55:31.720 --> 55:37.160]  in the public lexicon but they're not liberals they're like a mentally ill fascist cult who just
[55:37.160 --> 55:43.480]  wants to destroy any true liberalism and wreck the family and enslave women and persecute good loving
[55:43.480 --> 55:50.280]  men and just run around basically vandalizing everything like mental patients so so what do you
[55:50.280 --> 55:57.640]  call these people sickos well i call them the regressive left because they claim to be progressive
[55:57.640 --> 56:01.960]  but everything they stand for is regressive i mean look at what happened on the university
[56:01.960 --> 56:07.640]  campuses you know a couple of weeks ago which is interesting because now we've got this a series of
[56:07.640 --> 56:15.400]  different graffitis on a campus i think is in ohio with the isis flag this pro isis graffiti
[56:15.400 --> 56:20.360]  it's on the judge report we are coming pro isis message is found on ohio college campus
[56:20.360 --> 56:26.440]  so they found their ideological route again the intolerant regressive left which shout
[56:26.440 --> 56:31.480]  down as anyone shouts down anyone disagrees with them censors people they've now found their
[56:31.480 --> 56:37.560]  ideological inspiration their route and it's basically isis jihadism so the two go together
[56:37.560 --> 56:41.480]  oh yeah they come out and supported it excuses for it they've come out and supported it
[56:41.480 --> 56:50.120]  yeah and again i go back to turkey because the young turks buy out this video defending this
[56:50.120 --> 56:56.760]  booing and jeering at the football match 800 million dollars worth of isis oil has been
[56:56.760 --> 57:02.360]  sold in turkey okay so it's not just Saudi arabia that's backed dabbing us or whatever you want to
[57:02.360 --> 57:08.520]  call it the center of evil as far as isis is concerned is turkey i mean listen to this this is
[57:08.520 --> 57:14.760]  out of a nafisa mad article which went up about a week ago a senior western official familiar with
[57:14.760 --> 57:20.200]  a large cache of intelligence obtained this summer from a major raid on an isis safe house
[57:20.200 --> 57:25.960]  told the guardian that quote direct dealings between turkish turkish officials and ranking isis
[57:25.960 --> 57:31.960]  members was now undeniable so it's not only the training that happened you know a couple of years
[57:31.960 --> 57:36.840]  ago it's not only the isis members being allowed to go back and forth between the country and these
[57:36.840 --> 57:43.000]  oil tankers as well now there's actual high-level coordination between the turkish government
[57:43.000 --> 57:48.040]  and ice we have the former head of defense intelligence who just quit six months ago
[57:48.040 --> 57:54.120]  saying they were ordered by obama to build up al-qaeda and isis turkey gives them artillery
[57:54.120 --> 58:01.400]  support routinely and has been shooting down syrian aircraft that try to bomb the infiltrating
[58:01.400 --> 58:08.520]  jihad forces i mean it's public that turkey is running the main assault and then we have this
[58:08.520 --> 58:13.320]  out the express a couple of days ago turkey threatens russia overbid to obliterate islamic
[58:13.320 --> 58:19.320]  state terrorists so they're actually calling on russia to stop bombing turkey and again this is
[58:19.320 --> 58:24.360]  one of the us's prime allies in the region and russia's not they're bombing right on the border
[58:24.360 --> 58:30.840]  when they squirt these turds into syria i mean i hate to use a gross analogy but that they got

[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:31.480]  devastating point after devastating point we've got coming up in the fourth hour david nine who
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.560]  makes his own amazing points will be hosting the fourth hour maybe if he's got tom on the checkbook
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:40.360]  guess he's got stuff coming up later he'll he'll air this truth truth about islam video that paul
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:47.240]  says is so powerful that he's about to release at info wars dot com the next hour paul again i'm
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:53.640]  rarely wrong about big issues but sometimes i am wrong because i underestimate just how crazy the
[01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:58.600]  globalist are just how much they hate the west and renaissance and so i guess they love radical
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:07.560]  islam because it is so barbaric evil dark twisted mindless authoritarian but i mean i didn't believe
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:11.880]  obama was really trying to overthrow countries and part of a caliphate and a you know this was six
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:16.360]  seven years ago i was hearing this or eight nine years ago from coursey and then beck and others
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:19.720]  and beck's been wrong about a lot of stuff that's been proven i'm not criticizing him i'm just saying
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:23.560]  he said a lot of stuff about me and true but i mean i just when somebody's right i'm gonna say i
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:28.680]  don't want to fight with glenn beck he he he popularized this caliphate stuff and now i look at it
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:33.720]  and the stuff obama's doing and the things he's been caught doing he really probably is a closet
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:38.600]  radical jihadist and really is trying to double cross the whole west and is trying to bring down
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:44.360]  the west and i just can't believe the elite actually put a guy in i mean i know they're bad but
[01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:49.560]  why would they want to do that when the west is giving them all their power paul watching you
[01:01:49.560 --> 01:01:57.240]  at about three minutes finish up well because they see syria they see bashar alasad and iran
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:03.080]  as a bigger threat to their geopolitical hegemony than a group like isis so i mean that's why they're
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:09.160]  allowing it to grow in in size they likened it to a frankenstein monster that they wanted to
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:15.160]  keep under control to some extent and obviously that hasn't worked there are over 130 dead people
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:21.800]  in paris god knows how many more to come belgium brussels has basically locked down their metro
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:27.560]  the shops aren't open nobody's going out because they fear an imminent attack because of course
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:33.560]  one of the guys who attacked in paris is still on the loose so i don't think they truly understood
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:38.840]  what kind of hellholes these jihadist capitals have become the fact that in mollenbeek you can get
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:45.240]  a military grade weapon on the street within an hour for 500 euros and of course those weapons are
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:50.360]  coming through libya which again they destabilize to overthrow a secular which go right into europe
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:54.680]  but oh europeans can't have guns to protect themselves but the jihadis have rocket launchers
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:01.800]  exactly and now even the new york times has come out and said that you know u.s central command
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:08.600]  were engaged in a year long effort to deliberately conceal the fact that this plan to fight isis by
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:16.120]  not bombing isis's oil fields which is the main funding mechanism behind isis was completely ineffective
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:20.520]  i mean that's come out in the new york times now so finally after russia begins this blitz
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:26.200]  against isis as of the end of september all this is finally coming to life but paul we can just laugh
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:30.680]  at russia and donald trump being right then that makes us morally intellectually superior
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:35.080]  if we just say we're liberal and cackle but are actually real stupid so let's just pretend we're
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:40.520]  done those people are dumb racist they want to they want to take the refugees and uh they're
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:46.200]  sexist too here here here let's go out one minute acting like a moron with an ad iq let's do it
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:56.200]  together uh i'm the young terax here let's do it together go ahead well i mean the main point is
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.640]  islam is not a race it's a religion in fact there's a video within this video that i'm putting out
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:05.960]  which i mean you'll probably want to play this part tomorrow whatever and it's a conference of
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:12.760]  self-proclaimed moderate muslims in london i think and the speaker asked the audience you know they
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:17.800]  call us radical muslims we're moderate muslims we're not jihadists we go to mosques we go about
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:23.800]  you know a normal business and then he's like so hands up who supports stoning women for adultery
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:30.360]  who supports segregation who supports executing rape victims and these self-proclaimed moderate
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:36.200]  muslims at this conference you know black some of them white some of them arab all in unison the
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:41.000]  entire audience puts their hand up they all support stunning women yeah yeah let's kill women that
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:45.560]  have been raped and glorious time doesn't say one word out of her fat mouth or mr madow or any of
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:51.400]  these people because the truth is they hate chivalry they hate men that love women they love evil
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:05:00.520]  they love their father beelzebub thank you paul in the second democrat debate this last weekend
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:05.000]  those last minute change the day before to talk about foreign policy because of the terrorist
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:11.720]  attacks the sanders campaign was furious bernie wasn't ready to talk about terrorism the moderator
[01:05:11.720 --> 01:05:16.440]  asked him if he still thought the greatest threat to national security was climate change absolutely
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:21.080]  in fact climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism you understand what sanders is
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:26.760]  saying climate change is directly related to terrorism terrorism has nothing to do with wars
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:31.560]  for oil and power it's not about a clash of cultures and as every liberal will tell you
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:38.120]  it has nothing to do with islam so it must be climate change bernie al qaeda and isis were not
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:43.880]  created to fight climate change but there is an indirect link bernie sanders won't tell you however
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:49.960]  if he even sees it al qaeda and isis are creation of the same governments and multinational corporations
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:55.400]  that are trying to create a global government using terrorism and climate change as an excuse

[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:03.720]  toilet bowl coming up here in a little while so that's going to be he begged to go on an assignment
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:11.160]  of course but then he's glad he went but that's what's happening this is the type of news i have
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:15.560]  just a mix into the stack this is not a roiders and they're reporting this with a straight face
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:24.680]  change climate change root cause of syrian war britain's prince charles says this is a guy whose
[01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:30.120]  family gets billions of pounds a year in taxpayer money and whose wealth is a state secret but they
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:35.720]  have over a hundred palaces are the biggest landowners in the world and collectively own
[01:09:35.720 --> 01:09:42.680]  controlling interest in british petroleum and dutch royal shell the third and fourth largest
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:50.200]  oil companies the man is worth trillions and when he's not lecturing us how we shouldn't be able to
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:55.880]  have a car or be able to have air conditioning that's what he does just like obama does he is
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:01.560]  telling us that no the west didn't fund through saudi arabia and turkey and others a jihad to go
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:05.000]  kill non-radical muslims and there are a lot of those folks a lot of beautiful wonderful people by
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:09.560]  the way i'm not islamic there are a lot of really nice muslims it's just the ones you're up shipping
[01:10:09.560 --> 01:10:14.520]  in and the ones getting promoted the ones didn't you know promoted by hollywood is cute and cool
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:19.800]  are a bunch of socialist loving woman hating crazy people
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.120]  and prince charles of course goes and hangs out and takes vacations with the king of saudi arabia
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:29.560]  it is disgusting same story
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:39.240]  Britain's prince charles has pointed to the world's failure to tackle climate change
[01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:44.360]  as the root cause of the civil war in syria terrorism and consequent refugee crisis in
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:48.920]  gulfing europe yeah it's not the devaluation of global currencies and food prices going up it's
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:55.160]  not the jihad it's not the population of middle east doubling in the last 25 years uh no no no it's
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:59.560]  it's all because the climate changes i thought it was warming oh now it's just change
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:04.600]  either way everything works out perfectly fine
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:11.000]  the heir to the british throne who's not british
[01:11:13.720 --> 01:11:21.800]  i am welsh very few people in england you could even call british that's just a word from the british
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:30.600]  a tribe these people are not british they're not welsh they're not scotch they're not irish
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:36.280]  they're not from those islands they are from transylvania they are hungarian romanian and
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:46.680]  they're not even that the heir to the british throne who is a transylvanian impostor i would
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:53.800]  add to Reuters the heir to the british throne this family took over what almost 300 years ago when the
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:02.200]  frank line the the the william mcconker barbarian line died out
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.240]  see i shouldn't go into history lessons i should just give the article
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:15.320]  it's just everything's a lie i'm just sick of it the heir to the british throne is due to give a
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:22.440]  keynote speech at the opening of a global climate summit in paris next week where 118 leaders will
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:28.440]  gather to try to nail down a deal to limit rising greenhouse gas emissions oh the big global
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:34.040]  government summit in paris for everything from slipping on a banana peel to the easter bunny
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:40.120]  not delivering enough eggs as the foals of global warming i'm sorry climate change is the new bs term
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:46.920]  the last few years the prince the prince what an anachronism said in an interview with sky news
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:52.680]  to be aired monday and recorded before number 13 the tax in paris that such symptoms were a classic
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:58.760]  case of not dealing with the problems oh my gosh he predicted up evil and more refugees before it
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:05.000]  happened that was hard to predict when it's part of an admitted plan by the head of the un migrant
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:14.040]  body peter sutherland i say it's quite incredible uh relieves the crisis of being caused by you
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:19.400]  not paying me enough carbon taxes i'm heavily invested in the carbon exchanges uh if you just
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:27.960]  pay me let me turn off old pensioners gas allotment while we we have a government allotment of hundreds
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:36.120]  of millions of pounds of gas to heat the palaces but old british pensioners ride on the buses all
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:42.520]  night as not freeze to death i'm descended from vlad the impaler so i do have a bit of a stake in
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:50.600]  the country as it were oh yes that's prince charles i'm descended from vlad the impaler
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:56.840]  that's why i'm spending most of my time in transylvania at the family castle and i cut to it
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:05.800]  and it's actually Dracula castle can't get weirder can't get crazier can't get stranger and let's
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:14.680]  just pay money to this piece of garbage and by the way when i said that they get hundreds of
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:19.240]  millions of pounds a year of money to feed the palaces that's been a big national scandal
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:25.560]  you got people worth trillions of dollars and they're sucking off the british people
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:31.800]  and the people of the uk oh i'm just so tired of them and they were such masters at playing
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:39.400]  the irish and the brits and the scots off against each other when it's all just basically the same
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:46.200]  people just such sick evil i am just so tired of it divide and conquer it's why they always
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:51.080]  rule us we can get smart someday and figure it out go to the stars together but i guess we won't
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:58.120]  don't if we don't wake up there it is queen tried to use state poverty fund to heat bucky
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:08.920]  see why i can't just cover any of the news because i take one article i could talk three hours on
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:23.000]  this all ties together how everything intersects i'm not he never even gives us evidence so i'm
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.720]  going to get into it here's another one climate depot flashback 1941 scientist claimed global
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:34.760]  warming caused hitler warmer temps may produce a trend towards dictatorial governments well it's
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:42.520]  true that warmer weather in the summer causes more crime and violence that is a status more
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:46.680]  crime probably double on a full moon for a lot of different reasons
[01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:56.680]  but to say that it caused hitler not in a short term but it is true that warming cycles
[01:15:56.680 --> 01:16:03.080]  cause larger population blooms and then that causes whether it be in rat colonies or human
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:10.520]  colonies more war and this article is kind of like discrediting it look how kooky this is but
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:14.520]  she normally almost all science that global warming is this horrible evil thing is pure
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:21.320]  bold this i would actually say has threads of truth to it but the larger idea is wrong
[01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:28.040]  as if warming itself is bad no expansion is good more growing areas is good for the whole planet
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:33.880]  more life forms it's not just humans that bloom and in warm weather and that just doesn't mean
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:42.520]  seasonally but in larger trends and cyclical seasons there's not just the four seasons in
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:53.560]  the 365 orbit of the sun there are other seasons and spectrums in fact dr mills believes the rise
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:57.480]  of power of adults hitler in germany and but he was lean idly may do in part a gradually
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:01.720]  warming temperature of the world people are more docile easily led in warm weather than in cold
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:10.200]  that's not true so yes the the report is quackish is a quackle report of the pink duck type but at
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:19.960]  the same time it is important to understand that warmer weather in general is better for the planet
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:23.800]  it's not some horrible scary thing even though the earth is now cooling according to all the
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:28.120]  satellite reports because the sun cooled down but what i say doesn't matter because the un had a
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:34.280]  vote five years ago and said the sun does not affect climate at all period sun gets hotter puts
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:40.760]  off more mass coronal ejections more solar radiation the un voted and said it doesn't affect
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:45.800]  things could they vote and suspend reality maybe they could suspend gravity maybe they could vote
[01:17:45.800 --> 01:17:52.200]  and give obama another peace price how about when he eats a baloney sandwich we give him one
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:55.880]  or how about when he plays golf we give him one how about when he goes to the bathroom we give
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:18:02.920]  him one how about we in fact i want to nominate him for another nobel peace price i really do
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:09.240]  right now i want to nominate obama for a peace price for funding isis to murder hundreds of
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:14.360]  thousands of christians in syria because he's been a total warmonger they gave him a peace
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:24.440]  price so why not give him more why not fully invert reality but you can say that obama didn't earn
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:29.480]  his peace price he says you know you didn't build that you didn't compose music you didn't write
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:34.600]  a book you didn't do good job playing football you didn't come up with a great new design for
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:40.680]  architecture no no one no individual ever did anything but the individuals captaining the
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:47.480]  big collectivist systems they did everything but then in reality what's the nobel peace prize like
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:54.680]  400 000 dollars or something you didn't earn that you didn't promote peace so see it's someone who
[01:18:54.680 --> 01:18:58.840]  doesn't do anything but's been given everything i mean obama has had a silver spoon in his mouth
[01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:04.440]  this whole life he's slick he's smart he's a good talker but other than that he he he was created
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:13.720]  he was built he was picked he was groomed he was thrust out there he was fertilized under the
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:20.200]  wings of the new world order and that's why they want standardization and centralization
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:27.560]  is because they can't compete with the renaissance they can't compete with an organic alex jones
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:32.200]  coming out of nowhere or an organic matt drudge coming out of nowhere they can't compete with you
[01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:37.080]  coming out of nowhere they can't compete with the mark dies coming out of nowhere they can't

[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:22.040]  zemerman they just got back from london stan peristan islamabad belgium
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:28.520]  and they just said it was crazy people just shooting pistols on the side of the road and
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:33.400]  just people running around and women with headdresses everywhere i mean it's one thing if you see
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:40.040]  some of that but then it's europe or it's austin texas and at least here we can have guns the europeans
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.480]  don't have guns but the jihadis are just lawless and do whatever they want
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.440]  and again they ran our reporters out of the places they went in paris in belgium in england
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:58.840]  it's that they're not being assimilated and they're allied with the black lives matter
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:04.040]  socialist george soros people and we have footage coming up when they come in studio
[01:25:04.040 --> 01:25:10.280]  if you're a tv viewer for radio listeners go to info wars dot com it's a gateway pundit article pro refugee left us
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:16.840]  rally in paris attack police and it's french but they're socialist and they want the divide and
[01:25:16.840 --> 01:25:22.840]  conquer they know this is their brigade army and so they're just attacking the police and more
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:30.200]  because they hate the government even though it's a socialist government with 80 something
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:36.360]  percent tax on average doing everything they want they're so self-loathing they want to
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:44.040]  suicide the country completely that's coming up in the next segment now let's be clear
[01:25:45.320 --> 01:25:52.040]  the governments are corrupt in many nations the police have big problems but at the in game level
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:56.440]  when they fully overthrow our countries they're going to turn the public against the police
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:00.680]  they're going to have truth and reconciliation deals they're going to try police by the tens of
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:06.760]  thousands per country and they're going to use all the corruption that the feds and the globalists
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:12.920]  let you be involved in to coup you and to bring you all down and then bring the whole country down
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:19.000]  because local government is the target and so that's why i haven't aligned myself with the police
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:24.760]  you know my police right or wrong i've aligned myself with fighting a globalist strategy
[01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:29.480]  i want to reform the police we're going to reform them taking over our local governments
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:34.760]  getting the constitution back promoting good officers firing bad ones we're not going to
[01:26:34.760 --> 01:26:41.880]  fix it with george solos who overthrew ukraine two years ago and admits he did with rioters
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:48.680]  attacking police and overthrowing the electric government we're fighting a formula a formula
[01:26:48.680 --> 01:26:56.200]  a shaking bank and i'm not an idiot who sits here and goes along with it as much as i detest
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:03.240]  what some of the police do and by the way every time i look into it almost every time there's
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:10.200]  been a few cases that it hasn't been just outright corruption by police in some small towns the north
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:14.680]  southeast the west robbing people taking stuff out of their purses whatever some of that goes on
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:20.280]  but that itself was created by the feds and acid formative seizure almost all of it was the feds
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.240]  they corrupted the police they they screwed them up and they're not even feds they're
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:30.280]  they're an occupied government and and not even all the people in it are bad a lot of them are super
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:44.520]  awake in fact i had an fbi agent come up to me in barns and noble i was in barns and noble
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:49.080]  my kids some stuff so we can buy myself and it was like a convention of guys in suits
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:54.920]  i had like six seven people it wasn't a convention the place was pretty much empty but like everybody
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:59.160]  at the end of it was wearing suits and ties for some reason at lunch on saturday and they were
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:05.320]  just all coming over to me and one of them i was talking to and he goes well we're not all your
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:08.280]  enemies and we appreciate all what you're doing and then i was talking to him i said oh you're in
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:12.600]  the government he goes oh yeah fbi it was just you know just another fbi agent i've run into that's
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:17.720]  a listener again it just shows you how many people in the system are awake themselves
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:22.520]  and sure they thought i was crazy 10 years ago i'm still probably crazy maybe it takes
[01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:28.040]  a crazy person to see this stuff for a long way off but it's here now folks i mean you'd be crazy
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:33.080]  to believe this 20 years ago i didn't want to believe it it is crazy but it's real
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:39.960]  i mean look at this washington post article i'ma spend a lot of time on in the next hour
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:44.920]  law enforcement took more stuff from people than burglars did last year the washington post but see
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:50.120]  they don't tell you why that happened or what the end game is or that the government ships the
[01:28:50.120 --> 01:28:56.360]  drugs in and creates the crisis they just go oh law enforcement oh see local police they're the bad
[01:28:56.360 --> 01:29:06.440]  ones nothing about feds in here so see now over washington post that's as think tank and as
[01:29:06.440 --> 01:29:11.240]  global as it gets it's gonna report on asset forfeiture now and how horrible it is
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:19.720]  so they can come in and federalize all the local police which are already partially federalized
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:25.560]  because almost all asset forfeiture is only allowed through federal programs so they criticize the
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:30.600]  police for being involved in the federal globalist program but now they're going to discredit the
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:38.120]  locals for being on the strings as marionette puppets of the central system as it always is
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:46.120]  and then now the washington post might win a pool of surprise for exposing police abuse oh thank you
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:54.040]  but not where it came from we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[01:29:54.040 --> 01:30:02.600]  network the latest rich person who lives the life of luxury in one of their mini houses travels in
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:07.960]  private jets but is telling you that you have to cut out every modern convenience in your life
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:14.200]  is the king of sweden that's right king carl gustav was a reputation of being quite a ladies man
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:19.640]  has now called for a ban on bass and admits he is ashamed to run one after realizing how much
[01:30:19.640 --> 01:30:24.680]  energy they use i am laughing while i'm reading this that is right to show how eco friendly he is
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:31.880]  he also drives a hybrid car and he's using low energy light bulbs now that's where it gets absurd
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:37.400]  back in canada anyone who admits carbon will pay alberta says as it releases tough climate change
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:42.360]  policies which includes a mandate that two-thirds of coal fired electricity generation be replaced

[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:53.320]  their carbon footprint yes in fact there are some people out there that actually believe this

[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:54.200]  yeah this is a good song right here i think we've got to turn this up for a moment
[01:33:58.840 --> 01:34:01.880]  you're turning my songs about i've got to talk about some other news that go to you guys in a
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:07.400]  second but i tell you i can feel the world waking up i can feel victory rising there's
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:13.560]  going to be some trials and tribulations but i can feel the initiative worldwide for humanity turning
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:17.080]  the tides turning right now i think we've had a magical time a lot of bad stuff's going to
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:21.480]  happen before it looks better but in my spirit i i really feel the tides turning just briefly
[01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:25.000]  don't agree with me under peer pressure if you don't agree i didn't tell you i was going to say this
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:29.960]  when joe biggs and michael zimmerman came in here back from europe but but just brief question
[01:34:29.960 --> 01:34:34.200]  that i'm going to come back to you after i have this news do you think the tides starting to turn
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:38.280]  there's definitely a mass awakening happening but it needs to happen a lot faster on a much
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:43.480]  larger scale you know going to europe now and seeing these numbers you know paul read off the
[01:34:44.120 --> 01:34:49.000]  the statistics the the the percentages of people who are pro isis pro jihadi
[01:34:49.720 --> 01:34:56.520]  that entire sharia law mindset 25 in france it's mind blowing those aren't french that's not even
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:00.200]  a that's that's not like they call these guys that attack the ones that weren't immigrants
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:07.400]  frenchmen they're not frenchmen no i'm sorry go ahead but i mean when i first heard those
[01:35:07.400 --> 01:35:11.400]  poll numbers i was like that that's insane there's no way that's where you got over there and half
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:15.720]  you get over there there it's no joke i mean people in america need to wake up that stuff can happen
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:21.800]  here a city in america can turn into molambique overnight we're gonna break that down in a moment
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:25.160]  with you and mr zimmerman here in just a second very powerful info i want to read some of these

[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:41.800]  now in the london stands in the paris stands in the jihadi veils and of course michael zimmerman
[01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:45.960]  michael let's start with you worked here a few months great camera guy great editor you've been
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:51.800]  on a few assignments you got thrown into the mix mix of this um what was it like your observations
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:58.120]  that we're going to get gel bags a very interesting trip to go on it is very strange to be in a place
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:02.280]  that just recently had these kinds of terror attacks go on and you've got police and military
[01:43:02.280 --> 01:43:07.320]  everywhere you know walking the streets warnings about potential chemical attacks going on while
[01:43:07.320 --> 01:43:13.160]  we're there and it's an interesting place to be the hotel we're at they were on black alert is
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:19.000]  what they called it said it was one of the highest uh spots that they believe that would be attacked
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.200]  in london because of the train station and the proximity to other places so i'd heard a siren
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:28.920]  earlier that day and i was like what is that and i walked down to the bar in the hotel and i was
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:33.640]  asking these guys like what's going on like like oh my this is the world black alert right now
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:39.160]  they're expecting this place to get hit and you're sitting here and i'm like i feel like like i'm an
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:46.760]  artist i'm like bob ross in overseas right now without my paintbrush my paintbrush being my ar15
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:53.320]  because they don't have that ability to to do that i'm i'm like picasso when it comes to a gun
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:58.840]  i can do whatever i needed you feel naked yes and he i feel like bob ross i couldn't paint my happy
[01:43:58.840 --> 01:44:04.680]  little trees or my clouds i had a canvas but no brush you know and it's the worst thing to be good
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:10.280]  at happy little trees yeah the worst thing is nice little nice little and not be able to do it nice
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:15.480]  little brook nice little barn little deer that's the easiest way i can i mean i got home last night
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:20.760]  and i literally got all of my guns and put them in bed with me and laid down and slept with them
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:26.200]  i was so excited to like i was like ah you think obama likes that oh i don't care
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:33.720]  but you know you know it says right here white house gives isis 45 in a warm that just further
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.240]  proves of what we've been saying since day one well they've been doing it the whole time now now
[01:44:37.240 --> 01:44:40.840]  they've just been caught because i got a little throwing it out in the open with the department
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:47.400]  defense admitting it in the video but getting back michael Zimmerman described when you went to
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:51.800]  brussels belgium and as three times you got run out of restaurants run out of convenience stores
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:56.840]  run off the street followed by cars just you're not supposed as a european come in these i guess
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:01.720]  whole towns now uh where the jihadis are from uh you were talking about people shooting guns on
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:06.360]  the side of the street they all got guns rocket launchers they're being found because the police
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:10.520]  won't go in these areas but all the rest of the good little europeans follow orders and you know
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:15.320]  they'll just lay down and let their daughter get raped i mean it's crazy what the socialists have
[01:45:15.320 --> 01:45:19.160]  done what the social engineers have done so break down what you witnessed there and then joe begs
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:24.360]  right so we took a train from paris to brussels and from brussels we actually walked 40 minutes
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:29.880]  into mollambique which is this area that they call uh the jihadi capital of europe because all these
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:34.840]  attackers came from this mollambique area people who did the the attack on the train earlier this
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:39.400]  year came from mollambique and just numerous other attacks over the years came out of this
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:43.160]  neighborhood i gotta do is google well they're fighting imperialism according to black lives matter
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:49.160]  right so we walked into mollambique and we shot a couple reports in front of the house that had
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:56.680]  been raided the day before where the paris mastermind had lived and then we started walking back to
[01:45:56.680 --> 01:46:01.880]  find a place to go before the live show and you know somewhere to sit down for an hour or so
[01:46:01.880 --> 01:46:06.200]  and it started to get dark and it started to rain so you know put equipment back in the bag so things
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:11.160]  wouldn't get wet and very quickly you know we tried to go into this business and we're
[01:46:11.960 --> 01:46:14.920]  how'd a guy yell at us an aerobic and slam the door on us and
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:21.400]  prevent us from from entering this business there and then we started walking back into town because
[01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:25.720]  it just really felt creepy wouldn't you say well why did you just tell me you're a refugee and needed
[01:46:25.720 --> 01:46:29.800]  some free everything that's what they tell the germans right of course he probably is a refugee
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:35.240]  but he wasn't well i got my head poked in because i wasn't in the very front and i poked my head in
[01:46:35.240 --> 01:46:38.760]  and when i looked in there i kind of saw the the crowd of guys that were in there i mean it looked
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:45.800]  like a it was like team in america he goes i like your balls i look at their baseballs these guys all
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:49.880]  look up and they're kind of like giving that look like this guy just walked into the wrong place
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:55.080]  and next you know this guy jumps in and it's me mike's behind me and paul's to my right and his
[01:46:55.080 --> 01:47:00.680]  hand shoots right across me grabs the door and slams it back and starts like screaming and paul said
[01:47:00.680 --> 01:47:03.480]  he could understand what he was saying is basically saying get the hell out of here you don't belong
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:08.600]  here so we're kind of like all right this is really creepy let's just get out of here let's beat feet
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:12.600]  so we're walking and i'm like all right everybody keep your eyes open 360 perimeter look around
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:19.400]  and next thing you know there's a car past middle left came back around came back again had three
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:25.080]  younger males and they have the window down and the guy jumps down he's like he's screaming at us
[01:47:25.080 --> 01:47:29.320]  and saying all kinds of garbage and you know basically get out of here go back home we don't
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:34.280]  want you and another car came up behind him and they pulled in front of us and kind of stopped for
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.680]  a second and there was another group of men inside of that they stopped and they're looking they got
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:42.440]  their phones like that the whole time out the window and they just got the smirk on their face
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.600]  like yeah everybody ready to jump out and that's just nobody beats their I mean I'm sorry but I
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:51.880]  mean this this would not fly in many areas the United States these Europeans have been so gilded
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:57.640]  on average that I've been over there filming in London and people you know Muslims in full
[01:47:57.640 --> 01:48:01.160]  outfits will come out of their way when I'm just not even aimed at them and screaming me to turn
[01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:05.320]  my camera off now when I tell screaming them back Paul's been one before then they back off but I
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:12.040]  mean I just don't get with this leftist attitude that they've been planted over Islam now there's
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:17.480]  just this idea that you're so evil because you're a European it's crazy I mean one of the more
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:21.560]  terrifying things is like you said we're standing outside of this guy's house the supposed master
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:26.360]  mind I hate calling him a mastermind because he's not it's not you don't have to have a pretty easy
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:31.240]  to go out of murdering people who are watching the concert I mean that's just cowardice but this
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:35.560]  is where the guys live and we're out here we're taking pictures we're filming this guy opens up
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:39.400]  stores looking at us and he's got like this look and then slams the door back and goes inside I'm
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:42.680]  like yeah that's a little weird and I was like there's no telling I was telling him and Paul was
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:47.560]  like wonder how many guys in here right now they came back after that raid yesterday and sure enough
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:52.440]  yesterday we're reading these reports they found explosives in there chemicals tons of weapons
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:56.120]  and we're sitting out there those guys could they just easily popped off an RPG that had been
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:49:03.720]  it of us I mean that's just how that place has fallen and the citizens there don't care
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:08.200]  they've done nothing to stop it like you said here in America something like that happens
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:12.040]  people are going to try and step up and do something but then we have these places like
[01:49:12.040 --> 01:49:18.280]  Islamville and York South Carolina that are completely run by jihadis and no one does anything
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:22.120]  about it. Let me ask you a question I know the beard is not only a jihadi invention it's what
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:27.240]  men have had on their faces for the beginning of the species but you've never adopted a garden
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:32.120]  known beard before why have you adopted one? I was trying to blend in when I went over there
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:37.480]  so it's fine for you to have a beard. You know it was really either the scary thing to be honest
[01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:44.600]  as I got these two white guys tall white guys you know blue eyes and I am the short guy with a
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:49.000]  beard so I was like I felt a little bit safer because I could like put a hat on kind of blended
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.920]  in a little bit I got these two guys over here I got Paul Joseph and Mike walking. They could act
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:58.280]  like they were resting here. I was sitting there like man you guys are sticking out like huge targets
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:03.320]  but you know it was interesting. I don't think it's facial here I just can't stand it on me it just
[01:50:03.320 --> 01:50:07.480]  itches. Yeah it goes through a point and then after it gets. I've never grown a beard once it gets to
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:11.640]  this point it actually feels pretty good it's nice it's nice and warm. Well finally cold weather but
[01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:16.040]  you're not going to keep that here in the summer when it's 110 on you. No this is just uh till
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:25.000]  December type deal. Do the ladies like it? Oh yeah. They do? Yeah. Well then I guess you got to keep it.
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:30.280]  But I wanted to get to another thing though I was reading some reports of there was a man
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:34.920]  and a woman and one was a French reporter well I'll talk about it when we get back from break.
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:42.040]  And I want to get some more of your uh chronicle more of your testimony about what you saw
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:46.040]  Michael Zimmerman as well and then we're going to go through more of these articles and and play
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:50.440]  some of these clips where Hillary Clinton says it's a mistake to send troops to attack ISIS
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:55.320]  even if the homeland is struck so we're going to look at that as well stay with us.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:04.600]  My name is Bill Wanner and I have an important message right now the highest levels of government
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:11.160]  are struggling against an inevitable crisis but they're about to lose control. When this happens
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:17.320]  it will rip our country apart in ways you never imagined from where we shop to the doctors you
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:23.080]  visit and the family you want to protect. Look I've made predictions like this before a few years ago
[01:51:23.080 --> 01:51:28.680]  I warned that the housing prices would collapse before that I warned that dot-com companies
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:34.680]  would crash and they did. Those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing
[01:51:34.680 --> 01:51:42.760]  to do with the stock market this will affect us all. I've posted a free video at dollardanger.com

[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:10.840]  alice jones here back live with joe biggs and michael semerman in full wars
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:17.320]  cameraman and reporter just back from europe and i want to be clear as paul watson said the last
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:22.600]  hour and i don't say this to be politically correct i say this because it's what i believe i do not
[01:54:22.600 --> 01:54:29.000]  believe that in general everyone that is a follower of the prophet muhammad or the abrahamic
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:34.440]  you know derivation religion of islam is a horrible person wants to kill people but there
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:39.080]  is a war in islam of the radicals to take it over and by the way they're winning in my view
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:42.760]  and the numbers and statistics show that there is persecution against christians
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:47.720]  and then the leftist are bringing in to have a clash of civilizations and use the crisis to take
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:54.600]  our freedoms and then they'll also use the backlash against radical islam to then go attack
[01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:59.320]  muslim countries that are secular like iraq i talked to a lot of troops i could ask bigs about
[01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:05.000]  this but i was talking to some guys yesterday marines and and and they were saying you know
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.680]  being around the middle east that they thought on average you know iraqis where they be shia or
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:13.240]  sunni were pretty cool people but then you go to other areas like saudi arabia there really is a
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:18.520]  dislike of westerners there unless you're in the elitist quarters you're a billionaire and you see
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:22.760]  that when you go to europe so i wanted to ask you i don't i mean just from being of the demographics
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:28.040]  knowing the different groups i mean i would imagine these london stands they admit are mainly sunni
[01:55:28.040 --> 01:55:34.520]  they're wahhabist a lot of them are from saudi arabia other areas i mean it is general areas where
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:40.760]  they just didn't get together in these ghettos from certain countries and just have a crazy
[01:55:40.760 --> 01:55:49.000]  hatred of the west but want to get here um so country versus country uh what was your main
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.080]  issue who were you mainly up against were you ever up against shiites or was it mainly sunni
[01:55:53.080 --> 01:55:57.560]  yeah mainly sunni i mean in iraq it was different i mean you've got a lot of farmers you've got a
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:01.240]  lot of these people out there who just work day to day they just want to provide for their family
[01:56:01.240 --> 01:56:07.080]  they really don't care about what's going on it's the ones who have somewhat been affected i guess
[01:56:07.080 --> 01:56:12.280]  by something or radicalized going to these uh radical moths that kind of get that whole mindset
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:17.160]  where they just hate americans but day to day like you the guys who said you talked to you the other
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:21.960]  day um i'd run into people run up give you a hug and say thanks for coming out here and helping us
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:25.560]  you know there's a lot of crazy people out here that are you know they hate you guys but they're
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:29.720]  killing us in record numbers just as much as they're they're doing anything else so you
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:34.280]  know even in afghanistan oh 97 percent i remember this number i think from lands that a few years ago
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:39.160]  97 percent of the people that radical muslims kill are muslims yeah
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:45.320]  it's i mean you can get on what is it live stream or whatever that video is lively and see videos
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:50.520]  of these guys just killing people their own people all the times hundreds just because they have like
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:57.240]  maybe a smidge of a difference in belief i mean that's that's crazy and yet we're supposed to be
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:01.480]  tolerant of that we're supposed to be accepting you know and this which brings me to this whole
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:08.280]  story i wanted to tell you guys about an rt there is this article up and it says we kill innocent
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:13.080]  people so there's this guy he's a reporter from france his name is pierre genisak and he's with
[01:57:13.080 --> 01:57:17.480]  a sister he goes to the bar to climb to watch uh the theater or the uh the concert his sister's a
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:21.720]  huge fan of eagles of death metal which is the american band that was playing that night when the
[01:57:21.720 --> 01:57:26.920]  massacre happened and he said that they were running like the shooting started and it took a little while
[01:57:26.920 --> 01:57:31.720]  for people to understand really what was going on so him and his sister gripped tight arm in arm
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:35.240]  running through the crowd he said there were pregnant people on the ground people are standing
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:40.440]  on women running over people they didn't care if they were dead alive everyone was in survivor mode
[01:57:40.440 --> 01:57:44.680]  they were just trying to run out and the people who couldn't get up got trampled over people were
[01:57:44.680 --> 01:57:50.680]  getting shot and they were able to get upstairs and run and hide and in this area and he said at
[01:57:50.680 --> 01:57:54.680]  this one point they're sitting there and they're they're hiding and there's just they're literally
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:58:00.040]  just thin wall on the other side it was so thin they could hear one of the the guys and there's
[01:58:00.040 --> 01:58:03.960]  this lady out there screaming and crying and saying please don't kill me and the guy goes
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:09.880]  we're here because of france swahalan he's like your people have bombed our country now we're
[01:58:09.880 --> 01:58:15.240]  killing you all stop crying you will be dead soon and this guy's coming out saying hey i understand
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:19.800]  why that happened now i don't hate these people because our government's been bombing him well
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:24.680]  maybe the french government's bombing and they've killed innocent people but you don't kill more
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:30.760]  innocent people it's beyond that the french government is one of the main culprits causing
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:36.840]  the whole civil war and doing it all and that again is the liberal idea oh kill me i deserve it

[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:02.520]  michael zimerman you were there for a week other observations you made than joe begs
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:09.720]  it was just an interesting place to be with all the police and military activity everywhere
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:15.400]  and just how dead the city was i had been in paris about 10 years ago and it was completely
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:21.480]  different being there now than than back then i love how they leave the gate open bring in all
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:25.880]  the people but then set up checkpoints everywhere randomly that'd be like if your castle was under
[02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:32.280]  siege you lower the drawbridge let the enemy in and then station guards over your own people's
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:39.400]  beds that you only do that if it's a power grab sorry go ahead right so everywhere we went restaurants
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:44.280]  and just all the monuments things like that you just didn't see any people there it was just a
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:48.600]  empty city the whole time we were there the entire week by the way the president want to come out
[02:01:48.600 --> 02:01:53.160]  and said go out don't be scared got a better chance of dying in a car wreck we're not cowards
[02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:57.560]  people would have come out in the streets but they said stay in troops everywhere again in
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:02:02.200]  colking this this culture of fear well in in brussels right now they're telling people stay away from
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:07.560]  the windows stay away from you know stay in your homes don't come to work today uh so brussels is
[02:02:07.560 --> 02:02:11.000]  completely on lockdown right now they're training them for martial law in fact this is the big
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:17.240]  issue i'm glad you raised this they're saying no demonstrations allowed in france now this is
[02:02:17.240 --> 02:02:23.240]  france free speech has been banned like it's the old soviet union but then the left has still come
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:30.680]  out and riot again they're using this to to to take over absolutely you asked why the socials do
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:37.960]  this here it is joe yeah and you know i had the opportunity i stayed up later i couldn't sleep
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:42.600]  i was trying to stay on us time a little bit so i stayed up before 35 in the morning every day
[02:02:43.160 --> 02:02:47.160]  and eight once a day i mean and i would want to go out and explore to see what it was like
[02:02:47.160 --> 02:02:51.320]  because i've really never even been to these parts before and i was curious what the night life was
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:55.720]  like compared to how it was while we were there and everybody i talked to you know they're like
[02:02:55.720 --> 02:03:00.840]  hey man our business is suffering no one's coming out you know no one is able to i mean they're
[02:03:00.840 --> 02:03:04.600]  just so scared they're paralyzed to be out at night time there now during the day there's
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:09.880]  normal operations going on heavy traffic people walking around shopping as soon as that sun goes
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:14.280]  down boom everyone's off the streets there's no one going they're closing everything down
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:18.280]  well that's because they put a curfew in too but people were very defined that was only for a few
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:25.480]  days i believe but people were just horrified and then they like you said they implemented this curfew
[02:03:25.480 --> 02:03:31.080]  i spoke to some of the bar owners out there and he said no we're not doing that and they all came
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:35.720]  together in this little district area of paris and said no we're not going to close down this is our
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:41.480]  livelihood this is how we make our money he says if we close down that means a terrorist win that's
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:46.200]  what they want they want to disrupt our business they want people to be scared to go out and he
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:50.520]  said all these business owners these bar owners were in defiance of that whole order and they sat
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:54.360]  there and they left everything open even though nobody came in but they wanted to show people
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:59.240]  that they weren't going to be bullied around and pushed and locked in the state of fear exactly let's
[02:03:59.240 --> 02:04:03.960]  talk about world war two and heller was bombing during the blitz london and other cities it made
[02:04:03.960 --> 02:04:09.000]  people more resilient made them more aggressive they weren't calorie even though tens of thousands
[02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:17.880]  were dying every few nights and it's just it's this culture of nittying fear and look you were
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:23.640]  there you weren't afraid i've gone out to events after terror attacks i was in london you know two
[02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:28.600]  days after seven seven with paul watson and i mean and it's not there wasn't even courage
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:32.840]  statistically and if you're in a city of 10 million people and let's say there's gonna be an
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:38.680]  attack that's gonna kill a couple hundred hundreds die every day in car wrecks and cities that big i
[02:04:38.680 --> 02:04:44.280]  mean it's just not it's not that big a threat the threat is the response of them taking our
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:48.280]  liberties out of it now it's obviously horrible and it's a crime and it's a mass murder and it's
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:55.560]  it's a big deal but the hysteria is the mind control 800-259-9231 your take on this and more
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:05:02.520]  800-259-9231 well isis threatens to attack the us record number of legal immigrants are flooding
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:06.520]  into the country thanks to lax enforcement by federal authorities barely a week after the
[02:05:06.520 --> 02:05:12.280]  november 2015 isis attacks in paris france the us border patrol revealed that nearly 3000 unaccompanied
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:15.960]  children were caught crossing the border in the weeks leading up to the attacks but just think
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:19.480]  of how many more illegal immigrants were able to slip into the country without getting caught it's
[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:24.040]  probably at least 10 times more speaking on the subject house representative duncan hunter said
[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:28.120]  quote the greatest existential threat to this nation right now is this administration's open
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:33.240]  border policy hunter speaking the truth isis is likely already exploiting president obama's open
[02:05:33.240 --> 02:05:37.640]  border policy to smuggle their own militants into the country but here's something else you may not
[02:05:37.640 --> 02:05:42.680]  realized human traffickers are also taking advantage of obama's open borders to enslave women around
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:47.240]  the world and import them as sex slaves into the us in other words obama's lax enforcement
[02:05:47.240 --> 02:05:52.280]  immigration laws is fueling a war on women this is get daniels with info wars dot com and be sure

[02:08:25.880 --> 02:08:32.200]  so in the united states honey bees kill over 250 people a year lost it's closer to 300 last time i
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:39.800]  checked the world almanac deer it's 200 to 300 jumping out in front of your car but four or five die a
[02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:47.320]  year when a deer just white tell alone attack you with their antlers and actually kill you at a park
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:50.920]  and that happens you see it in the news four or five times a year
[02:08:53.640 --> 02:08:59.640]  so you got a better chance of being killed by a wasp or a water moccasin or a rattlesnake
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:07.560]  then you do being killed by an icis terrorist here in america but over 300 000 people have been killed
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:12.840]  according to the syrian government but also u.s. government and others estimate that's about right
[02:09:14.600 --> 02:09:19.960]  most of them civilians most of them shiite most of them alawite most of them christian
[02:09:22.040 --> 02:09:27.400]  by the jihad forces from all over the world run by saudi arabia pouring and attacking
[02:09:27.400 --> 02:09:37.880]  but the hysteria and the fear in europe with brussels belgium and paris france almost no
[02:09:37.880 --> 02:09:42.840]  one out at night ghost counts in places that bustle till three in the morning
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:49.960]  because of hysteria and fear it's a triumph of mind control just as for a decade after
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:54.840]  jaws they had to get full page ads out in the washington post the new york times the la time
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:59.560]  saying please come to our resorts actually pulled these ads up online you can there's
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:03.400]  actually newspaper clippings of these from the 70s saying shark attacks only kill you
[02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:07.880]  know 15 people a year worldwide or whatever most those aren't even great whites and the average
[02:10:07.880 --> 02:10:14.200]  varies it could be five it could be 20 but it's about 15 a year but still almost everyone i know
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:21.480]  is scared especially in water that's not really visible and murky water most grown men i know
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:27.480]  know when i was in college or high school wouldn't go swimming out in the water further
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:32.120]  they're like sharks sharks and you know what there are sharks out there but maybe a few
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:40.840]  hundred get bit a year usually little bites black tip or whatever um folks that's not a real threat
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:47.960]  but see it's scary it's got big teeth it's got mean eyes and it's the same thing oh my gosh these
[02:10:47.960 --> 02:10:51.880]  are terrorists oh my gosh they're yes so we're being terrorized by these people but also the
[02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:57.080]  globalists want us to give up our rights to be protected from the big monsters we shouldn't give
[02:10:57.080 --> 02:11:02.520]  into that fear we should say no to destabilizing the middle east no defunding the radical jihadist
[02:11:02.520 --> 02:11:08.920]  no to creating an atmosphere that lets them have power and turkey buying their oil and all the rest
[02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:17.720]  of it so it's somewhat sophisticated but the big threat is that the socialist countries the globalists
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:25.240]  the leftist are allied with radical islam are allied with the major universities and are bringing in
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:30.600]  mainly sunnis radical sunnis wahhabist
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:37.880]  all over the western world and then they go and they get in their own neighborhoods
[02:11:38.440 --> 02:11:45.720]  you're not welcome and folks it's an epidemic upwards of 90 percent of the rapes in sweden
[02:11:45.720 --> 02:11:50.440]  in germany in in france look it up this is in the news till they're passing laws saying they can't
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:57.160]  publish it it is in many of these radical cultures that if a woman is doesn't have her head covered
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:02.200]  and is and is out without a man accompanying her you're allowed to rape her and then she's executed
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:07.160]  you don't get in trouble you're taught her a lesson this is a big this is a big issue
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:12.520]  and they're now the leftist are now saying this is basically a sacrament and an offering to the
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:17.160]  radical muslims is the women of europe and they go and they cry the police and nothing's done
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:24.040]  maybe someone's given a fine not even probation then the same feminists say there's rape culture
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:30.840]  in the west when it's almost statistically one of the lowest places in the world and they tell
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:36.040]  women well if you had a few beers it's rape or if you didn't the next day if you didn't want to do it
[02:12:36.040 --> 02:12:40.680]  even though you said yes so men are now getting women to sign contracts or i'm literally getting
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:44.920]  them to write down hey or text message you want to have sex with me right now this is actually a
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:48.760]  phenomenon yeah that all came from the Dave Chappelle show he actually did a skit like four
[02:12:48.760 --> 02:12:53.800]  years ago maybe longer where it was the uh sexual consent form and he would sit there and roll over
[02:12:53.800 --> 02:12:57.400]  you know would start off with like four playing then he would like all right before we go any further
[02:12:57.400 --> 02:13:01.240]  lay down his contract and said all right i need you to sign here here check if you agree to this
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:05.880]  this this but the feminists have taught women to lie so much is a new way to get ahead that all
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:11.640]  people i know that are single actually have have women write down that they wanted to have sex i'm
[02:13:11.640 --> 02:13:16.760]  not kidding this day and age i mean you have to do it you have to i actually i think it's i think
[02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:20.840]  everybody started doing it i'm not kidding i think it should be online contracts they sign a contract
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:26.440]  yeah read it do the no maybe maybe shoot a video stamp it say i you know i'm because because but
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:35.640]  see all sex in the west with women is sexist just like the 14-year-old daughter of uh seinfeld said
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:43.480]  you know boys and girls together period is sexist but if it's a jihadi raping you and then murdering
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:48.680]  you it's loving and cute what do you guys think this is we're gonna go to some calls and play
[02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:53.880]  some clips but what do you think this mental illness is i think you and paul said this on
[02:13:53.880 --> 02:13:58.440]  about a month ago just just political or societal cuckolding like you've talked about it's
[02:13:58.440 --> 02:14:03.880]  societies enjoying watching themselves get destroyed because they've had it good so long
[02:14:04.680 --> 02:14:11.400]  just throw a fit right just pull brats yeah it's pretty scary you know i remember being you know
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:17.960]  younger in my college days you know and there's many times you know you you kind of like you know
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:21.800]  maybe i shouldn't have done that but that doesn't mean that doesn't give me the right to go back
[02:14:21.800 --> 02:14:29.160]  even though we both consented on something going well now i don't mean it so then i guess it's not
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:35.560]  okay that we did it in the first place that just makes no sense that you can go the next day when
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:42.120]  you both consented and then go around and change your mind and then destroy someone's life completely
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:47.640]  well it's like the lacrosse team turned out it was totally fake it is i mean i've talked to police
[02:14:47.640 --> 02:14:52.600]  i've also talked to lawyers and i've seen the numbers it's now been recognized though that
[02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:58.760]  somewhere like 80 plus percent of rape claims are fake and there's this for attention this
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:02.920]  well there's this idea now you're just a lot of why about somebody because it's a male you know he
[02:15:02.920 --> 02:15:07.080]  must have done something to me i mean there's a lot of people that reach out and do that for
[02:15:07.080 --> 02:15:12.520]  attention although there are lots of people that happens to i've known quite a few women that that
[02:15:12.520 --> 02:15:17.480]  has happened to and that's a horrible thing oh absolutely rape is real but there are discussing
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:22.280]  people up there who really are starred for attention and will use that as a way to get
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:28.200]  that that that 15 minutes so people kind of like care about them all of a sudden they feel that and
[02:15:28.200 --> 02:15:32.920]  it makes them feel alive and then eventually it all comes out and it's all destroyed but still though
[02:15:32.920 --> 02:15:38.600]  being accused of rape is just as bad as actually doing it because once you've been accused in the
[02:15:38.600 --> 02:15:43.560]  media they completely wreck you by that time once it comes out they kick you out of school
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:47.320]  you know your job's probably going to fire you your parents are going to hate you your friends
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:52.360]  are going to turn their back a lot of them will and then you've lost it all even though if it comes
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:57.960]  out in a report later on that this chick lied if you can't take back accusations like that you
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:02.680]  know once someone's reputation is ruined it's you can't fix well i've talked to a lot of lawyers
[02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:06.920]  you know that i'm friends with them knowing they said that in child custody cases
[02:16:06.920 --> 02:16:11.640]  um and they said it's a phenomenon with women you know men commit most of the bank robberies
[02:16:11.640 --> 02:16:18.440]  most of the murders most psychopaths are men um you know we know criminology so i'm not demonizing
[02:16:18.440 --> 02:16:25.480]  women it's a fact though that women are the main group that lie about rape and it's also
[02:16:25.480 --> 02:16:29.960]  they're the main group that poisons yeah that's how a woman goes after you as they poison you
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:34.120]  generally i mean there's just criminology and so we're just talking about facts here but it's a
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:38.600]  phenomenon getting worse that the leftists are basically teaching all sex between a man and a
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:44.200]  woman is rape that's actually taught at major universities i mean talk about screwing the
[02:16:44.200 --> 02:16:48.040]  species up i want to go to phone calls i want to play a bunch of clips here the reason we got off
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:55.640]  into this though is the left is on record was it sweden just last month banned newspapers
[02:16:55.640 --> 02:17:02.520]  publishing rape statistics uh the religion or ethnicity of it now we've always known politically
[02:17:02.520 --> 02:17:11.160]  correct garbage does that but they passed a law double check me see if it's sweden i was sweden
[02:17:11.160 --> 02:17:16.600]  or maybe it's the netherlands and i think it's sweden sweden bans publishing rape data i think
[02:17:16.600 --> 02:17:22.680]  was the headline and it's just wild uh speaking of the devil uh someone raping the american people
[02:17:22.680 --> 02:17:27.800]  financially and raping our rights and who helped cover up her husband's real raping of women he
[02:17:27.800 --> 02:17:33.880]  settled with uh he is a serial rapist so all the feminists love him of course uh oh yeah it's it's
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:41.960]  hillary thinks it's really funny we're gonna go to your phone calls after the break but i uh
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:47.960]  do want to go to hillary clinton a mistake that's in troops if isis attacks us homeland this
[02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:54.120]  is her own c-span again no the mistake was arming and creating him to begin with and so i was against
[02:17:54.120 --> 02:18:00.600]  the iraq war i was against the afghan war now if we were really honest about it we helped turkey and
[02:18:00.600 --> 02:18:05.560]  others in europe and nato go and invade these countries we now have a responsibility to take
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:10.920]  out isis but we also have responsibility to impeach and indict obama and hillary and all of them and
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:15.720]  have nurenberg trials this is serious war crime and they think we're so politically dumb they're
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:20.520]  going to confuse us and not going to look you've gone too far globalist okay the military knows
[02:18:20.520 --> 02:18:25.720]  the people are waking up let's go to this hillary clinton clip here it is there's policy here but
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:32.360]  there's also politics um there are inescapably people trying to appear tough and tougher just
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:39.320]  here seeing it if there were god forbid another a terrorist attack god forbid in the united states
[02:18:39.880 --> 02:18:45.320]  do you think the pressure to send american troops into syria would be unstoppable well it would
[02:18:45.320 --> 02:18:50.360]  certainly grow but i think it would be a mistake look i i as i said we should be sending more
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:57.240]  special operators we should be um empowering our trainers in iraq we should be you know leading
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:04.760]  an air coalition uh using both fighter planes and drones we have we have a lot of work to do
[02:19:04.760 --> 02:19:10.440]  to be able to really decimate all the time i've been part of these training groups where we go
[02:19:10.440 --> 02:19:15.400]  over and try to train these iraqi forces these afghan forces they don't have the same type of
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:21.000]  courage that most americans are willing to do they don't have the courage to stand up and fight
[02:19:21.000 --> 02:19:24.440]  when you go train these guys by the way we're not just saying that it's well known worldwide
[02:19:24.440 --> 02:19:29.320]  i mean i'm something even bad people it's just i mean i've seen it firsthand i've been part of it
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:34.360]  i mean i know these guys you train them we dump millions and millions and dollars the french
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:40.200]  foreign legion takes millions and it takes chinese it takes germans it takes scots it takes anybody
[02:19:40.200 --> 02:19:43.160]  but middle eastern it's never worked what made them think it was going to work with these four
[02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:46.840]  five guys they trained over there spent like five hundred million dollars on so the question is then
[02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:52.520]  why will the al-qaeda people fight because they're they're part of a specific demonic religion of
[02:19:52.520 --> 02:20:01.960]  wahhabism they'll be back to talk about that if you or someone you care about loves outdoor adventure

[02:23:55.320 --> 02:24:08.920]  I'm ranting and raving here it's just so evil to see Hillary Clinton
[02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:13.560]  ran standing about what we should do in Libya and Syria and Egypt everywhere when she's the
[02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:19.640]  main author heading up the state department at the time for five years who ran all this admittedly
[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:25.000]  and she's such a villain we're not watching a James Bond movie here we're living
[02:24:26.440 --> 02:24:30.760]  all of us but especially those of us that are journalists or on the front lines or military
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:35.960]  and the public doesn't get this but the military does this is where they went too far and I want
[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:40.200]  to go to phone calls from Costa Rica the Netherlands Michigan New York Missouri
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:43.240]  Adrian Europe first the Netherlands then the Jose and Costa Rica but
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:47.320]  you were trying to make a point when we went to break about trying to train these forces
[02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:51.720]  is I mean yeah I just don't understand how our government thinks it's going to work
[02:24:51.720 --> 02:24:55.560]  and they keep trying to tell the American people that it's going to work you know these moderates
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:59.640]  they so-called trained over there to fight ISIS they cost 500 million they trained five of them
[02:24:59.640 --> 02:25:05.080]  yeah and they literally just laid down their arms and started ISIS taken away I didn't
[02:25:05.080 --> 02:25:10.200]  just make that up hundreds of millions of dollars to train five of them what can you do with five
[02:25:10.200 --> 02:25:16.040]  guys it's all that that's a dummy program right but people they're they're given the weapons to
[02:25:16.040 --> 02:25:20.280]  ISIS but people believe it I don't get it like I said I've been part of these training groups I've
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:25.080]  I've got friends in special forces who've worked with these people and I'm telling you soon the
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:28.920]  shots are fired these guys are throwing their guns down or running with their tail tucked between
[02:25:28.920 --> 02:25:34.520]  their legs scared they they are not built for that kind of stuff it takes a special individual
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:39.480]  and you can pump 500 million dollars into some literal tight jean wherein
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:44.680]  wimp and think that you're going to turn them into a fighter but guess what he just doesn't
[02:25:44.680 --> 02:25:49.640]  have the cahones and have the guts doesn't have what it takes money's are not going to build a
[02:25:49.640 --> 02:25:55.080]  fire you have to have people who are born that way who want to fight who aren't scared to die
[02:25:55.720 --> 02:25:58.920]  it doesn't matter how much money you put into it but these people don't want to
[02:25:59.640 --> 02:26:04.600]  they don't care they answer my question that I have before the break the scumbag al qaeda people
[02:26:04.600 --> 02:26:08.200]  from Saudi arabia and a few other areas that's what the british chose them as they were a fighting
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:12.680]  band that robbed caravans they just said here well they take the whole place over they're literally
[02:26:12.680 --> 02:26:17.320]  desert bandits and now there's some of the richest people in the world and they do go out and find
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:21.640]  psychotics out of europe psychotics out of the stands those people will fight yeah those are
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:25.560]  scary folks i mean who are we talking about that would attack you guys yeah al qaeda is definitely
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:30.520]  a whole another a whole another monster in itself i mean those guys are legitimate
[02:26:31.480 --> 02:26:36.120]  terrorist psychos people who will sit out there and train every day i mean just look it back with
[02:26:36.120 --> 02:26:41.080]  uh osama bin la and apparently he would give his guys like a small bag of rice and some water and
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:47.800]  they would have to live on that for days i mean that is real training to be able to go and fight
[02:26:47.800 --> 02:26:54.520]  in those trenches to go in the caves to be patient to wait to do it off small amounts of food to
[02:26:55.320 --> 02:27:00.840]  get that mindset to where you don't need a lot of stuff and you get so many people who get westernized
[02:27:00.840 --> 02:27:04.600]  and they feel like they need their video games and things like that and they get put into a combat
[02:27:04.600 --> 02:27:09.560]  situation and don't do good because they're not used to having nothing and making the most out of it
[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:14.600]  and there's a lot of people over in iraq and afghanistan who just don't get what it means to
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:20.200]  like really reach down and do something like that and yet we keep trying to send people over there to
[02:27:20.200 --> 02:27:25.080]  train them and i have not seen it work all right let's get to a call down next segment we'll go to
[02:27:25.080 --> 02:27:29.480]  more but let's go to adrian and the netherlands thank you for holding you're on the air go ahead
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:38.680]  hello alex hello crew welcome i'm a long time listener and first time caller welcome hi um i
[02:27:38.680 --> 02:27:42.600]  have a question actually because i noticed something and actually it's not really covered
[02:27:42.600 --> 02:27:48.680]  because like uh in a week from now we get like the climate top in paris yes you know and you have
[02:27:48.680 --> 02:27:54.760]  like a lot of like politicians as well in the us as in europe you know claiming that like the climate
[02:27:54.760 --> 02:28:00.600]  top is much more important than isis and a second thing i wanted to point out is that the attacks
[02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:06.440]  of the terrorists took place on a friday after the markets markets were closed
[02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:12.040]  so they had the whole weekend again to cover it what shows to me that there's probably like
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:16.280]  a new world order behind this because you know they they oh yeah i mean the globalist handle isis
[02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:19.880]  the idiot isis members don't even know that at the bottom but absolutely the doors were open
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:25.160]  at every level it is a false flag but not a fake geot attack they bred these people they turned
[02:28:25.160 --> 02:28:29.320]  them loose like starving pit bulls throwing a toddler in the midst of it well president france
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:33.240]  well hello and it has allowed the government to go in the military and the police to search
[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:37.560]  people's homes without a warrant and that is in effect for three more months so you don't have
[02:28:37.560 --> 02:28:41.560]  the ability to go no you're not welcome in here these guys can knock on your door or

[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:51.560]  absolutely another thing actually actually i would like to point out because one of the
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:57.480]  terrorists you know the guy who's still on the run he was caught on the belgium from border and let
[02:28:57.480 --> 02:29:03.000]  in they asked him for his they asked him for his passport they looked at it and it was just like a
[02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:08.920]  few hours or a few moments after the the attacks you know they looked at his passport and they said
[02:29:08.920 --> 02:29:14.040]  like oh okay yeah cross the border they let him go and they're still searching for the guy you know
[02:29:14.040 --> 02:29:19.560]  what's going on here well they're definitely protecting them as usual and let's expand on that
[02:29:20.520 --> 02:29:24.760]  they let up airplane with 140 something people come in from mexico and just no screening is
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:30.200]  let everybody in and again citizens are all screams though this is the takedown of our borders
[02:29:30.840 --> 02:29:35.880]  with some ultimate end to possible deniability when terrorist attacks hit they're going to take

[02:29:58.440 --> 02:30:03.400]  hamtrantic michigan is experiencing culture shock after becoming the first majority muslim city in
[02:30:03.400 --> 02:30:07.960]  the us for example business owners routinely advertise their products in arabic and they
[02:30:07.960 --> 02:30:13.640]  can't obtain liquor licenses within 500 feet of a mosque but besides his cultural shift hamtrantic
[02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:18.920]  also serves as a microcosm of america's economy hamtrantic was the home of a chrysler automobile
[02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:23.960]  plant back during the muscle car era of the 60s and early 70s everything from plinth barracuda as
[02:30:23.960 --> 02:30:27.960]  the dodge charges were built at the hamtrantic plant but now the plants closed down just like
[02:30:27.960 --> 02:30:33.080]  america's manufacturing base when the us dollar was chosen as the international medium of exchange
[02:30:33.080 --> 02:30:37.880]  decades ago us still had a strong manufacturing base but now it does it and the only reason why
[02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:42.280]  we're still able to maintain a trade deficit is due to global demand for the dollar but eventually
[02:30:42.280 --> 02:30:46.440]  other countries will stop accepting dollars for their products because we barely manufacture
[02:30:46.440 --> 02:30:50.600]  anything anymore and when that happens the us economy will close down just like the hamtrantic

[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:21.800]  hi um yeah i'm from costa rica i'm here son i'll say costa rica um alex i like to let the audience
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:26.280]  know about two things happening here um i've tried with the mainstream media but they don't
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:32.120]  replay any emails or anything like that so let's let you know uh you your only problem is not Mexico
[02:36:32.120 --> 02:36:37.320]  okay let me let me tell you what is happening right here right now in costa rica no i know i mean i
[02:36:37.320 --> 02:36:42.680]  mean every country as you go north is battling the flood from the south not of the productive people
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:47.080]  but the criminals everything else go ahead i don't know if the criminals are not that that's
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:56.520]  something i am not uh to say but um we have a flow of people coming from cuba going to ecuador going
[02:36:56.520 --> 02:37:05.240]  to panama crossing costa rica and they're currently stranded in between of costa rica and nicaragua
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:10.920]  and all these people are on their way to the united states of america to cross the border
[02:37:10.920 --> 02:37:16.680]  illegally through mexico i don't know how they do that but this is uh this is happening here
[02:37:16.680 --> 02:37:21.800]  well no that's actually been in the associated press the miami herald you name it and not just
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:25.400]  they're coming through florida they're coming through mexico for really the first time in massive
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:31.960]  numbers through through mexico and they're catching every day three islamists is ten islamists is six
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:37.480]  islamists at different border checkpoints they're pouring across two it is just and again the problem
[02:37:37.480 --> 02:37:41.800]  is there aren't really jobs for all these people it's not that they're even bad on average i don't
[02:37:41.800 --> 02:37:49.320]  blame cubans want to get out of there it's that our economy is melting down as well uh and so it's
[02:37:49.320 --> 02:37:53.800]  crazy uh but but how bad is it because i mean what you're saying is confirmed actually in the news
[02:37:54.760 --> 02:37:59.880]  but you're there with eyes on it what are you seeing well let me tell you what i'm seeing
[02:37:59.880 --> 02:38:04.600]  every day on the news because i i don't think you get this this news there but uh we are seeing
[02:38:04.600 --> 02:38:11.160]  three 300 people coming every day from panama to costa rica and they're being put in uh shelters
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:16.280]  you know what i'm saying shelters for these people our government is putting them in shelters
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:23.720]  there are kids women and and and and you know grown up men and they are putting in in shelters
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:29.480]  and they are giving uh what they call a transit visa so that means they don't cross costa rica
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:35.960]  illegally but they are able to go to to their yes mexico does the same thing with the guatemalan
[02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:41.480]  everybody else uh it's kind of an unofficial one it's you don't get off the train and we don't crack
[02:38:41.480 --> 02:38:46.920]  your head but but yes i wasn't aware that costa rica gives special transit visas where you can't
[02:38:46.920 --> 02:38:53.080]  stay here but you can go to el norte please continue right and i don't know what the american
[02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:57.720]  embassy is doing but they're i mean they they don't look like like they care like for you know this
[02:38:57.720 --> 02:39:02.600]  this problem which is actually uh a big problem for you there in the us i mean you're getting
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:07.320]  more and more people it's believed that 10 000 12 000 people have crossed the border illegally
[02:39:07.320 --> 02:39:15.080]  this only this year and this is this was discovered because uh it was discovered last week a uh you
[02:39:15.080 --> 02:39:20.360]  know a coyote uh network you know these people that uh transport people one country to another
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:26.440]  yeah they uh they were discovered last last last week by the local police so uh there is when this
[02:39:26.440 --> 02:39:31.960]  whole thing of the cubans crossing costa rica blew up so that's something i wanted to let you know
[02:39:31.960 --> 02:39:40.600]  next thing i want to let you know is uh last week uh in honduras they stopped um six syrian
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:47.480]  refugees with fake greek passwords yes i didn't see that i didn't see that yes yeah passports
[02:39:47.480 --> 02:39:55.640]  six greek passports got uh two honduras but there's there's one more i mean in costa rica
[02:39:55.640 --> 02:40:02.360]  we got one lady okay it's in the news this all this week she has been here because they got it with a
[02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:10.440]  fake passport coming from uh syria through uh south america and then to costa rica and she
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:16.760]  had been she has been detained by by the police i mean she's currently in jail with uh fake uh
[02:40:16.760 --> 02:40:22.760]  so the bottom line is regardless of who these people are security is a fraud because they're
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:27.240]  taking our rights tracking everything citizens do regardless of color or religion or race or whatever
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:33.480]  and then everyone else from the most dangerous areas is just let in crazy and then obama says
[02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:39.240]  don't worry about the isis threat but the number one threat is the tea party and the gun owners
[02:40:39.240 --> 02:40:43.560]  thank you so much jose they think they justify the security they bring in the uh the criminals
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:48.520]  they make they push out this narrative hey you guys need more security we need this police state
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:53.480]  and then that's how they track you keep you down exactly and jose when i was confirming what you
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:57.960]  were saying i wasn't like blocking you saying hey you're not breaking stuff here i was backing up what
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:02.040]  you were saying actually has been in our news but hasn't gotten the attention it deserved
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:07.800]  you were giving us from your perspective how much worse it actually was and and here's the problem
[02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:13.880]  because i've seen the numbers of used to most the cuban folks came in in boat lifts or whatever
[02:41:13.880 --> 02:41:19.400]  they were refugees from communist tyranny now it's being normalized that's not the case they
[02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:23.400]  are a lot of them are socialists that want a better life and we're coming to get the big
[02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:27.560]  communist thing to the north so these are not the type of cubans we want folks and they've
[02:41:27.560 --> 02:41:30.920]  actually been a lot of the cuban groups have been saying this they're interviewing these people
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:35.400]  these are these are not right wing cubans or libertarian cubans by any stressed imagination
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:40.120]  i'm not saying anybody's perfect but that's what's happening so it was hundreds of few years ago now
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:45.400]  it's tens of thousands as he was saying and that's just one avenue yeah and remember the head of what
[02:41:45.400 --> 02:41:53.240]  was it south com said last year that isis is coming in out of the caribbean through mexico i mean
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:41:58.680]  it's not us saying show bags exactly i did report on that that's right zimmerman well and isis
[02:41:58.680 --> 02:42:03.880]  themselves have said you know that they're going to exploit this this refugee and migrant crisis to
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:08.440]  put thousands of jihadis across europe there's no reason to think that they wouldn't do the same thing
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:12.920]  to us it's it's so incredible i mean we should be going hey it's not a conspiracy our government
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:18.680]  funds isis the head of defense intelligence went public three months ago he resigned six months ago
[02:42:19.240 --> 02:42:22.920]  and the interviewer goes you mean obama didn't know and he goes no we were ordered they know who they are
[02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:30.840]  they gave them the m16s they gave them the trucks the the people running our government are illegitimate
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:36.440]  hijackers of the country and again i'm gonna say for the ten thousandth time that is not rhetoric
[02:42:36.440 --> 02:42:45.800]  i'm not just saying that risking my life these people are dangerous our government funded isis
[02:42:46.360 --> 02:42:51.560]  under the name al qaeda and al nazarra to go in and murder hundreds of thousands of christians
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:59.800]  that's what they i can't even believe that joe i mean i can michael i can't believe that the people
[02:42:59.800 --> 02:43:04.760]  running our country early the siebel but they are and you realize well they really hate christians
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:10.600]  so who hates christians why is the persecution of christians doubled the last six years worldwide
[02:43:11.320 --> 02:43:15.800]  because there is a jihad against christians and there's a leftist attack on christians
[02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:20.040]  just like the communists did in russia and china they are purging us they hate us
[02:43:20.040 --> 02:43:22.440]  a do you agree with that b why do you think you're doing it
[02:43:24.840 --> 02:43:31.080]  well i do agree with it and i i don't know exactly why it is i think it might be because
[02:43:31.080 --> 02:43:37.320]  you know christianity is a it's a positive thing it's it you know is it it's a beneficial thing
[02:43:37.320 --> 02:43:43.640]  you know it promotes the good and they can't get away with their evil without going against the good
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:50.680]  so without bringing down the good things that we have they can't push their their evil through
[02:43:50.680 --> 02:43:55.560]  that's it they've got and they want to mount our head on the wall they have they hate us i don't
[02:43:55.560 --> 02:43:59.800]  care what they're black they're white they're jewish they're german they're chinese evil people
[02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:05.400]  are of an evil spirit i mean a wavelength an art type you know whatever it is it's real everybody
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:12.680]  knows that there are bad people that will do bad things even when doing good would help them physically
[02:44:12.680 --> 02:44:16.840]  or financially you wonder why that person do evil when they had everything going for them
[02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:21.400]  because they're losers i mean here's the thing our government wants to leave the borders open
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:26.120]  they want to bring in these syrian refugees just research what happened with the bodiclon
[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:32.440]  after these guys shot these victims they then proceeded to get down on their hands and knees
[02:44:32.440 --> 02:44:38.680]  and gut them that is pure evil and that is what our government wants to allow to happen yes there's
[02:44:38.680 --> 02:44:43.400]  going to be some good ones out there but there's also some bloodthirsty vicious psychopaths they're
[02:44:43.400 --> 02:44:48.520]  going to get in here and what does that do they allow them to attack more places which justifies
[02:44:48.520 --> 02:44:55.320]  a police state and gets you numb in a part in a in a lifestyle being used to not having any freedoms
[02:44:55.320 --> 02:44:59.560]  or liberties sure and they take everything away it's disgusting you know i want to do a piece where
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:03.480]  i show these jihadi leaders and others giving their speeches and eating hearts and gutting
[02:45:03.480 --> 02:45:07.320]  people and everything and it doesn't matter if they're from the middle east or they're a european
[02:45:07.320 --> 02:45:11.080]  that's gone over to whatever they have the same crazy look on their eyes it's not a fake look
[02:45:11.080 --> 02:45:16.040]  it's not a thousand yards tear i've seen a lot of combat vets and family it's not any of that it is a
[02:45:16.040 --> 02:45:22.200]  craved demonic light in their eyes that i saw in charlie manson's eyes and and other psycho killers
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:26.920]  and i really i think they're just demon possessed i've seen people have their heads chopped off
[02:45:29.000 --> 02:45:33.160]  it's disgusting and they do that and they have a smile on their face when they do it
[02:45:33.160 --> 02:45:39.240]  and they feel satisfied like that's what they needed to survive or to sustain who they are as a
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:45.160]  as a human being of some kind just like i need water and air that is what they needed to get
[02:45:45.160 --> 02:45:51.000]  their rush to feel alive and that's what you're going up against a lot of times it's just at the
[02:45:51.000 --> 02:45:56.680]  end of the day discussing and disturbing and our government wants to let these guys come in here
[02:45:56.680 --> 02:46:01.240]  it just seems like the like i wake up every day and like i have to pinch myself over and over again
[02:46:01.240 --> 02:46:05.640]  like am i really alive like this has to be a dream well then you turn the news on and you hear
[02:46:06.280 --> 02:46:09.880]  the government's preparing for right wingers to blow up police stations and attack they're
[02:46:09.880 --> 02:46:14.760]  getting armored vehicles it's guaranteed there'll be a giant war where veterans attack police and
[02:46:14.760 --> 02:46:18.040]  i tell every department this has been in the news we broke it but then it came out in the news
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:22.280]  afterwards we got the secret documents as folks know about six years ago they told every department
[02:46:22.840 --> 02:46:26.840]  veterans and patriot groups and they'd have my name in the report ron paul's as if he's gonna
[02:46:27.560 --> 02:46:33.400]  will attack you well no the globalists are gonna attack you and blame us and then they're also
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:40.840]  gonna have leftists go around and attack you i mean it's so transparent it's so ridiculous
[02:46:40.840 --> 02:46:47.320]  that they would try to blame the patriot when they go well oklahoma city we know the names of the feds
[02:46:48.280 --> 02:46:55.240]  multiple witnesses police officers hud people in the building we know who blew up oklahoma
[02:46:55.240 --> 02:47:04.200]  city we know their names atf fbi cia german intelligence and we know the names of the four
[02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:08.280]  guys in the building we talked to multiple witnesses they were there for two days before
[02:47:08.280 --> 02:47:13.320]  and they for exercise they go up and down the stairs of the nine floors jane graham and others
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:19.320]  and they she said what are you guys doing oh we're doing telephone work right there and she
[02:47:19.320 --> 02:47:24.600]  said big gray sticks of butter on the pillars and then she turns on tv and there's the head of the
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:29.960]  fbi hostage rescue team she just saw him two days before in the building with gray sticks of butter
[02:47:30.520 --> 02:47:35.320]  then we catch him he says oh i was in Dallas i wasn't there then we get his hotel receipts at
[02:47:35.320 --> 02:47:42.200]  marriott he's there he's there we have him open and shut we didn't blow the damn building up
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:47.480]  bill clinton did and i'm sick of it and i'm tired of risking my life to expose these piles of crap
[02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:52.520]  i mean it's we tell you why i get so angry folks because it's dangerous to expose these people
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:56.120]  and at a primitive level when i get up here and talk about these murderers i know it's dangerous
[02:47:56.120 --> 02:48:02.600]  i get in a just a crazy stance because my body knows i'm risking my life and he gets angry that
[02:48:02.600 --> 02:48:08.200]  i have to do this these people make me sick they make me sick i'm sorry go ahead and we're gonna take
[02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:15.320]  some calls yeah i just it's just mind blowing to see how many people see this kind of information
[02:48:15.320 --> 02:48:21.800]  like that we put out and can still believe the mainstream narrative of what's going on i mean
[02:48:21.800 --> 02:48:27.720]  how many times can we like put out information documents proof pictures video and people just
[02:48:27.720 --> 02:48:32.600]  sit there i interviewed don browning so let's go ahead i'm sorry i mean he got there two minutes

[02:48:58.280 --> 02:49:03.480]  they hate us telling you go ahead no i agree completely i mean it's disgusting and it's
[02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:08.600]  going to continue to happen until we get people pissed off enough and really are willing to stand up and
[02:49:09.880 --> 02:49:14.680]  they basically just say you know what i'm not going to follow this mainstream narrative anymore
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:18.760]  i don't believe it well the people deny that clinton's ran oklahoma city that's why i get so
[02:49:18.760 --> 02:49:24.040]  angry and i even see hillary and i realized now i actually see a picture of her i actually get upset
[02:49:24.040 --> 02:49:29.400]  because all this stuff i know they've done then we can't stop her it's a feeling of weakness that
[02:49:29.400 --> 02:49:33.640]  we can't defeat them and i mean and it's so obvious what they've done and people say oh they
[02:49:34.760 --> 02:49:41.880]  the same crew did fast and furious that's a false flag yeah they want to take our guns away but they
[02:49:41.880 --> 02:49:45.800]  want to give them to these guys so they can go and shoot people and then completely deny it
[02:49:45.800 --> 02:49:54.280]  it just don't get it i just it's it's complete and utter craziness at the end of the day it is

[02:54:23.880 --> 02:54:30.680]  that time he won't say it's not a bomb so they arrest him and now he's suing for 15 million

[02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:53.160]  and it's not even a clock that he invented he pulled a quarter of an
[02:54:53.160 --> 02:54:57.880]  clock and stuck it into a box or a suitcase yeah he just tore out the guts of a digital clock
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:06.360]  oh you can't make this stuff up yeah it's incredible uh let's talk to jason in new york
[02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:13.320]  you're on the air welcome how are you doing uh double things love your product
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:19.800]  it's so amazing i get the shirt supplements i get the water filtration systems thank you sir
[02:55:19.800 --> 02:55:26.280]  we couldn't do it without you no i appreciate you guys you guys are awesome uh quick question uh
[02:55:26.280 --> 02:55:31.960]  france i was watching tv last week it fell in tv that it got a whole bunch of raids
[02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:37.880]  to thousands of guns off the streets what's that about what was those raids about is it just going
[02:55:37.880 --> 02:55:42.520]  to anyone's home they can i mean do they have a second amendment and france no they don't uh
[02:55:42.520 --> 02:55:46.760]  they do have hunting but it's super hard to get a permit you got to usually keep it the place for
[02:55:46.760 --> 02:55:52.200]  your hunt uh austria is a little bit laxer but it's very extreme there's not a lot of gun ownership
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:57.240]  it's very restricted uh like england was before 20 years ago then they basically banned guns it's
[02:55:57.240 --> 02:56:00.440]  almost impossible you gotta prove land that you have a certain amount of land and then you've
[02:56:00.440 --> 02:56:04.440]  got to jump through all this stuff in order to be able to go i guess we'll be used for that so what
[02:56:04.440 --> 02:56:08.040]  they rounded up was a lot of illegal guns that have been smuggled in i mean there's news articles
[02:56:08.040 --> 02:56:14.520]  that you were there the jihadi's just shoot guns at night they've got guns okay so it is france under
[02:56:15.480 --> 02:56:20.040]  martial law yes in fact i meant to spend more time on that today they've banned demonstrations
[02:56:20.040 --> 02:56:24.040]  in the country by anybody but the border stays wide open so the border's open but you can't
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:32.600]  demonstrate for non-gmo or to control the border or against a war uh that's how they respond isn't
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:39.560]  that crazy yes and one more point mr jones uh in the crisis you hear on the news that obama was
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:44.600]  bombing them they was there right and then it just stopped for months and then all of a sudden you
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:50.280]  hear back in the news that we're bombing them again so on and so forth well i mean why why are we
[02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:55.640]  we announcing that we're bombing isis and that we really are bombing isis i mean isn't that
[02:56:55.640 --> 02:57:00.920]  kind of dangerous not to us the americans now that wow they're meaning something that we're
[02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:05.320]  bombing isis and that they're only doing that because the russians embarrassed them and started
[02:57:05.320 --> 02:57:11.240]  actually bombing them and still at stage they give them 45 minute notice since it's all theater
[02:57:11.240 --> 02:57:15.560]  and they also want to get isis in line and do what they're told which is take down a side
[02:57:15.560 --> 02:57:20.280]  and not run over and how to take over iraq i mean again our government doesn't completely control them
[02:57:20.280 --> 02:57:26.360]  it's more like a motley group of rabies infested dogs thank you jason uh let's talk to ben in
[02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:32.840]  missouri you're on the air hey guys how's it going uh it's going all right well i mean i feel like i'm
[02:57:32.840 --> 02:57:39.160]  in a twilight zone episode how's it going for you uh same way i'm calling you from the land of race
[02:57:39.160 --> 02:57:46.440]  riots and nuclear waste dumps on fire yes lovely st louis yeah it's a great place to be right now
[02:57:46.440 --> 02:57:51.160]  uh you know i think that we're really about to just reach the event horizon on this whole immigration
[02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:58.600]  thing uh you know as in relation to the terrorism thing uh also joe you did a great job while you
[02:57:58.600 --> 02:58:05.960]  were over there gotta say that as well thank you sir you have done well lord vader who was that uh
[02:58:05.960 --> 02:58:11.320]  germans i think especially have been browbeaten really particularly badly to accept all of the
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:16.280]  immigrants i mean they've got uh they've been running from the ghost of atoll hitler for so long
[02:58:16.280 --> 02:58:20.840]  that now it's just it's gotten ridiculous over there no that's it so the suicide of what's left
[02:58:20.840 --> 02:58:25.400]  of germany is supposing what needs to happen when the last start of world war one it was wrong
[02:58:25.400 --> 02:58:31.320]  against germany hitler was the response to that i he was a bad guy but he made the germans do what

[03:09:28.760 --> 03:09:33.800]  a shei the second generation the folks just joined us and you and you the break cut off with you
[03:09:33.800 --> 03:09:40.520]  saying you're against this massive refugee influx so please continue uh all right can you hear me
[03:09:40.520 --> 03:09:48.360]  yes sir okay so here's my perspective i'm first generation sharing this country i'm keep my uh
[03:09:48.360 --> 03:09:52.600]  i was republican i'm now a part of the key party i believe in the second amendment and i teach
[03:09:52.600 --> 03:10:00.040]  in my kids the same thing be honorable be just be a good man for you know for whatever the causes
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:07.320]  but what's being shown on tv what the face of this on today is not people wearing dirt farmers
[03:10:07.320 --> 03:10:12.920]  wearing pajamas walking around that's what's being sold to the public mainly is the golf
[03:10:12.920 --> 03:10:19.640]  state idea of what Islam is and that's completely wrong and um and the main portion is my point
[03:10:19.640 --> 03:10:25.160]  is i'm against uh the refugees coming here those people aren't um you don't know who they are they're
[03:10:25.160 --> 03:10:29.960]  not there they're not they're not go through a process and they could be they could be anybody
[03:10:29.960 --> 03:10:34.680]  they could be terrorists they could be good people but the chances of them being evil or
[03:10:34.680 --> 03:10:38.920]  you know being terrorists is too high to take that well then the public let's say it in America is
[03:10:38.920 --> 03:10:41.720]  so geopolitically illiterate we're probably the most illiterate in the world except for
[03:10:41.720 --> 03:10:46.440]  north koreans or afghans they have the global statistics we're on average really ignorant
[03:10:47.480 --> 03:10:52.440]  i hear them on the news going yeah i ran behind isis opposite group i mean they're gonna blame
[03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:57.240]  countries that didn't do this and start larger wars like blaming iraq for what saudi arabia was
[03:10:57.240 --> 03:11:02.120]  involved in on 9 11 with our criminal uh elements of our government so great points joe i appreciate
[03:11:02.120 --> 03:11:06.200]  your call i gotta punch out and hand it over to david night it's not fair to have him all
[03:11:06.200 --> 03:11:11.000]  quarterback lined up ready to take over here in the fourth quarter literally and not hand the baton
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:15.640]  to him but closing comments gentlemen uh michael zimmerman joe biggs and then come in here david
[03:11:15.640 --> 03:11:20.360]  night definitely been an interesting uh trip over there in europe uh people need to wake up this stuff
[03:11:20.360 --> 03:11:24.360]  is actually happening uh these guys are moving in they're getting in a place they're getting smarter
[03:11:24.360 --> 03:11:29.080]  and our government's helping fund this stuff so it's not a joke uh it's not being over exaggerated
[03:11:29.080 --> 03:11:34.360]  this stuff is real and it's happening well you can't take millions of people out of rural poor
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:38.680]  areas that have been dominated by radical islam that our government for 50 years has been funding
[03:11:38.680 --> 03:11:42.840]  because it keeps those countries backwards there was a whole golden age of islam and lord mongton
[03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:47.240]  talked about there were leaders of science and stuff and weren't invading people and they've
[03:11:47.240 --> 03:11:51.800]  sabotaged the middle east by putting these people in charge you can't take millions of them in here
[03:11:51.800 --> 03:11:55.720]  stick them in a ghetto and not have them run screaming for you to get out of there yeah i mean
[03:11:55.720 --> 03:11:59.480]  they are just whacked out fighting with each other and it just isn't compatible great point
[03:11:59.480 --> 03:12:03.960]  people need to wake up and stand up these open borders are going to kill europe it's going to
[03:12:03.960 --> 03:12:09.400]  kill the culture there it's yeah it's going to be the end of europe as we know it you're right
[03:12:09.400 --> 03:12:15.480]  of course you know the head of the un borders and refugee group the founder of the euro
[03:12:15.480 --> 03:12:20.520]  peter southerland says we want to end europe right yeah all of the the globalists and you
[03:12:20.520 --> 03:12:25.480]  know those in charge want to destroy europe how does he walk around when he's in ireland i mean
[03:12:25.480 --> 03:12:30.840]  that guy's not irish doesn't look like any irish but iris looks like some kind of penguin creature
[03:12:31.720 --> 03:12:34.920]  like rachel madhouse father or something all right i'm gonna stop right there anything else
[03:12:35.800 --> 03:12:39.560]  all right great job guys go get some sleep i know you just got back yesterday or jet lag

[03:12:53.320 --> 03:12:58.840]  going to be talking to neil fox he's done a musical documentary i think it's a very novel way to
[03:12:59.800 --> 03:13:04.040]  to get the information out there for people that you may know and your friends and family that
[03:13:04.040 --> 03:13:08.680]  aren't awake and i think you'll enjoy it if you are awake so we're going to play some of his songs

[03:13:14.040 --> 03:13:18.360]  who is muslim himself and he's concerned about people being brought over here and not being
[03:13:18.360 --> 03:13:23.560]  vetted of course we just had 150 people come in on this flight from mexico they were allowed to
[03:13:23.560 --> 03:13:29.080]  skip customs they were allowed to leave the jfk airport uh they just completely went through
[03:13:29.720 --> 03:13:34.040]  thank god you're covering this i should have made a bigger deal out of this i've mentioned it four or
[03:13:34.040 --> 03:13:37.320]  five times but i should have read the whole article so i'm going to shut up and let you read that
[03:13:37.320 --> 03:13:42.440]  and get calls and your guests but does i mean again 150 something people just flying we let
[03:13:42.440 --> 03:13:47.080]  your ride in don't even check anything i mean this is crazy i got three flashlights yeah an
[03:13:47.080 --> 03:13:50.840]  entire flight and so what we've got is we've got these keystone cops we've got these inspector
[03:13:50.840 --> 03:13:55.720]  clusos and france who don't know how to vet anybody and of course as they've said in in
[03:13:55.720 --> 03:13:59.880]  greece they said if they're not already registered in one of our databases it's impossible for us to
[03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:05.160]  vet them of course it is isis has said that they've got four thousand jihadis in europe and that would
[03:14:05.160 --> 03:14:09.800]  be out of five million understand that although that sounds like an astronomical figure when we
[03:14:09.800 --> 03:14:15.160]  see the destruction that was created by a half dozen in paris uh even though that looks like an
[03:14:15.160 --> 03:14:19.560]  astronomical figure to say there's four thousand jihadis uh that have been brought into europe
[03:14:19.560 --> 03:14:25.880]  that is only eight tenths of one percent eight tenths of one percent so that means 99.92 percent
[03:14:25.880 --> 03:14:29.720]  of the people aren't jihadis that come in but that's the way the government hides things when you
[03:14:29.720 --> 03:14:35.800]  try to find out what they're doing economically they always bury it with a massive data doc if
[03:14:35.800 --> 03:14:40.920]  you want to try to uh vet the financial spendings for example of a state government or federal
[03:14:40.920 --> 03:14:45.320]  government they will give you reams and reams absolutely absolutely i'm gonna hand it over to
[03:14:45.320 --> 03:14:50.840]  you great job guys thank you so much david night um please continue yeah so you know that i think
[03:14:50.840 --> 03:14:56.520]  that's precisely uh what they're doing here is that they're giving us they're overwhelming uh
[03:14:56.520 --> 03:15:01.880]  everything putting these little needles in the haystack because we understand that they're the
[03:15:01.880 --> 03:15:07.880]  ones who created who funded all of this we have to ask how many americans is obama willing to kill
[03:15:07.880 --> 03:15:12.840]  for his humanitarian solution because certainly we're not going to be able to stop this we're not
[03:15:12.840 --> 03:15:16.840]  going to be able to vet this he's going to bring in massive numbers of people and we also need to
[03:15:16.840 --> 03:15:22.760]  ask why is that the only humanitarian solution to bring them here of course it isn't the only
[03:15:22.760 --> 03:15:29.000]  humanitarian solution but it is the only solution for what their real agenda is they want to destroy
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:35.640]  the west western civilization western sovereignty they want to destroy western culture and this is
[03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:40.920]  happening right now as they're ready to build the building blocks of the new world order which
[03:15:40.920 --> 03:15:45.720]  are going to be the massive new quote unquote free trade for the republicans that's the beard
[03:15:45.720 --> 03:15:50.280]  that they're going to use for the republicans to sign on to world government and that's the
[03:15:50.280 --> 03:15:54.680]  trans-pacific transatlantic partnerships it's like oh we love free trade so give that to us now what
[03:15:54.680 --> 03:15:59.160]  you're going to get is global governance you're going to get crony capitalism and then for the
[03:15:59.160 --> 03:16:04.840]  uh for the left they want to offer them climate change we're going to protect the world's climate
[03:16:04.840 --> 03:16:09.400]  and so sign on but what you're going to get instead is you're going to get world government
[03:16:09.400 --> 03:16:14.680]  they want to put these two uh both of these and if they can get either one of them and they'll have
[03:16:14.680 --> 03:16:21.400]  a transnational body that will be able to manipulate and shut down our economies and I think it's
[03:16:21.400 --> 03:16:26.680]  pretty amazing when we see prince charles come out and say again echoing bernie sanders talking
[03:16:26.680 --> 03:16:33.320]  about how the root cause of terrorism is climate change and they can't even use the words global
[03:16:33.320 --> 03:16:39.240]  warming anymore because that's so laughable so they talk about climate change as if it's reality
[03:16:39.240 --> 03:16:44.040]  and of course that's what they're going to push in paris in just a few days it's coming up november
[03:16:44.040 --> 03:16:50.760]  30th so we're about a week away uh start next uh monday prince charles comes out and says that now
[03:16:50.760 --> 03:16:57.320]  it's also the root cause of the syrian war the civil war in uh in syria asked in an interview
[03:16:57.320 --> 03:17:03.160]  filmed three weeks ago whether there was a direct link between climate change conflict and terrorism
[03:17:03.160 --> 03:17:08.200]  prince charles said absolutely the same kind of nonsense that we're hearing from bernie sanders
[03:17:08.200 --> 03:17:15.320]  look as i pointed out before al qaeda was not created to fight global warming isis was not
[03:17:15.320 --> 03:17:20.360]  created to fight global warming uh the muslims think that they're fighting the crusades of
[03:17:20.360 --> 03:17:25.480]  a thousand years ago and the westerners think that they are fighting crazy terrorists but the
[03:17:25.480 --> 03:17:32.840]  reality is is that this is all being created by the global governance crowd who want to create a
[03:17:32.840 --> 03:17:37.480]  crisis create a problem and then offer their solution and understand too that prince charles
[03:17:37.480 --> 03:17:43.080]  is knee deep in this as is the pope in terms of pushing this they've been pushing climate change
[03:17:43.080 --> 03:17:47.960]  in this conference for quite some time and going back to uh uh earlier this year we've got the earth
[03:17:47.960 --> 03:17:53.400]  league which is prince charles is uh i guess we could call it the the league of dishonorable gentlemen
[03:17:55.000 --> 03:18:02.040]  going back to uh to that novel anyway uh prince charles and of course at his right hand was the
[03:18:02.040 --> 03:18:07.800]  scientific advisor to the pope john schellenhuber the german and then they're talking about having
[03:18:07.800 --> 03:18:14.200]  a planetary court and that was six months ago subsequent to that we got some early drafts of
[03:18:14.200 --> 03:18:20.200]  this climb uh this this climate meeting in paris and we could see that one of their options was to
[03:18:20.200 --> 03:18:25.560]  in fact have a planetary court have planetary governance to have enforcement mechanisms a
[03:18:25.560 --> 03:18:32.360]  planetary bureaucracy that is not accountable to anyone once it gets started the same type of thing
[03:18:32.360 --> 03:18:36.680]  that we're seeing with the trans pacific the transatlantic partnerships once they create
[03:18:36.680 --> 03:18:41.720]  these things once they put them in place they will have a independent body a global independent
[03:18:41.720 --> 03:18:47.160]  body that will be able to automatically change the rules without any further input from any uh
[03:18:47.160 --> 03:18:50.760]  any of the governments of course they haven't had any inputs from our elected representatives to
[03:18:50.760 --> 03:18:57.400]  create these treaties that's why i say prince charles is if it's true as the person who has the
[03:18:57.400 --> 03:19:03.560]  largest carbon footprint on the planet arguably uh prince charles would be the largest supporter
[03:19:03.560 --> 03:19:09.560]  and funder of terrorism if that's really true if climate change is based on carbon footprint
[03:19:09.560 --> 03:19:14.280]  and he's got the largest carbon footprint then he is the guy who is pushing this out there you
[03:19:14.280 --> 03:19:19.240]  understand that the war on terror the war on carbon if you want to call it that their climate
[03:19:19.240 --> 03:19:27.480]  change or all of these are planned problems and they're offering us one phony solution and just
[03:19:27.480 --> 03:19:32.520]  to show how phony this is look at this uh we had this article uh came out at the uh just before the
[03:19:32.520 --> 03:19:38.680]  weekend ex cia had james wolsey said he'd like to watch ed snowden be hanged for treason really
[03:19:38.680 --> 03:19:42.600]  really you know just as rand paul said you want to jail these people well fine okay but we'll
[03:19:42.600 --> 03:19:47.080]  jail you as well because you violated the constitution so he'd better be careful about
[03:19:47.080 --> 03:19:51.640]  the kind of prescriptions that he wants to put on people especially these keystone cops who let an
[03:19:51.640 --> 03:20:02.040]  entire plane load in will be right back don't take a cold or flu lying down stand up and fight back

[03:22:00.280 --> 03:22:06.440]  message right now the highest levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis
[03:22:06.440 --> 03:22:12.680]  but they're about to lose control when this happens it will rip our country apart in ways
[03:22:12.680 --> 03:22:18.200]  you never imagined from where we shop to the doctors you visit and the family you want to
[03:22:18.200 --> 03:22:23.320]  protect look i've made predictions like this before a few years ago i warned that the housing
[03:22:23.320 --> 03:22:29.400]  prices would collapse before that i warned that dot com companies would crash and they did
[03:22:29.400 --> 03:22:35.160]  those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing to do with the stock market
[03:22:35.160 --> 03:22:42.120]  this will affect us all i've posted a free video at dollar danger dot com maybe you'll
[03:22:42.120 --> 03:22:48.120]  disagree with my conclusions but first you need to watch this video and see the facts for yourself

[03:22:55.640 --> 03:23:05.160]  danger dot com earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us have
[03:23:05.160 --> 03:23:10.200]  had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we typically do the same thing
[03:23:10.200 --> 03:23:15.480]  we start with food storage then we address the need for water but if you consider heat storage
[03:23:15.480 --> 03:23:19.960]  i'm talking about staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider
[03:23:19.960 --> 03:23:24.440]  how will i keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the
[03:23:24.440 --> 03:23:30.040]  problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another concern
[03:23:30.040 --> 03:23:34.680]  there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in times of war there may even
[03:23:34.680 --> 03:23:39.960]  come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers may be simpler and less costly than you think
[03:23:40.680 --> 03:23:45.960]  for these answers go to fortress clothing dot com again fortress clothing dot com has the answers

[03:25:14.120 --> 03:25:19.560]  the last segment you know how do we vet real threats to us and of course it was interesting
[03:25:19.560 --> 03:25:26.280]  over this weekend that we had gio again giovanni gambino the son of one of the key figures in the
[03:25:26.280 --> 03:25:33.080]  gambino crime family the sicilian mafia saying don't worry he says we can do a better job than the
[03:25:33.080 --> 03:25:38.520]  cia and the fbi are protecting him and they probably can't yeah they probably can't and and you know
[03:25:38.520 --> 03:25:43.400]  i think probably the sicilian mafia could do a better job than the washington mafia uh they've
[03:25:43.400 --> 03:25:47.720]  had more experience for running a protection racket perhaps arguably of course the washington
[03:25:47.720 --> 03:25:51.960]  mafia is very old as well and of course in a protection racket what you're usually paying
[03:25:51.960 --> 03:25:57.320]  for is protection from the mob okay they come back you know it would be a shame of something
[03:25:57.320 --> 03:26:01.880]  would have happened to your business so i'd like for you to voluntarily donate some money to keep
[03:26:01.880 --> 03:26:05.160]  this thing going you know that's the way the government works that's the way the mob works
[03:26:05.160 --> 03:26:11.400]  and so it truly is that way and we've seen nothing but keystone uh inspector clusso antics from our
[03:26:11.400 --> 03:26:17.000]  own protection racket that we've got going in this country but right i guess the news one of
[03:26:17.000 --> 03:26:20.440]  the news items that you're going to talk about tonight is the new information about the clock
[03:26:20.440 --> 03:26:26.040]  kid yeah i mean it's obviously pretty interesting that we have the mafia actually speaking out
[03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:31.240]  talking about yeah we we do need to be protected you know but uh pretty interesting there but yeah
[03:26:31.240 --> 03:26:37.480]  so we we mentioned how clock kids family is now demanding an apology and 15 million dollars in
[03:26:37.480 --> 03:26:42.760]  damages and so let's tell everybody who clock kid is when we've talked about it so much that
[03:26:42.760 --> 03:26:47.080]  regular listeners know who the clock kid is but if you're just tuning in the clock kid is this kid
[03:26:47.080 --> 03:26:51.080]  who went to school with a briefcase it looked like something out of mission impossible yeah well
[03:26:51.080 --> 03:26:55.480]  actually so we're getting a little bit more of the details with it you know as as this case is
[03:26:55.480 --> 03:27:01.080]  being brought forward so a teacher heard beeping in her classroom she was asking where the sound
[03:27:01.080 --> 03:27:07.000]  was coming from the device was then presented to her and so what it is is a case with exposed
[03:27:07.000 --> 03:27:13.000]  wires and a timer attached to it and he would not say this is not a bomb or this is the clock and
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:16.920]  she was like well what is this so she just sent it to the school resource officer which is what
[03:27:16.920 --> 03:27:22.200]  you're i mean this these are the same schools that are kicking kids out and suspending them over
[03:27:22.200 --> 03:27:27.160]  pop tart guns yeah you know or drawing a picture of a gun or making pointing your fingers like a gun
[03:27:27.160 --> 03:27:32.600]  so then you present something that looks just like a bomb you would see in the movies and she's
[03:27:32.600 --> 03:27:37.800]  not supposed to do something because then she'll be considered racist is homophobic and so it's the
[03:27:37.800 --> 03:27:42.200]  same type of thing that we've seen obviously in the last few election cycles using racism
[03:27:42.200 --> 03:27:47.240]  this silence people yeah deliberately provocative absolutely most of these things that we see
[03:27:47.240 --> 03:27:52.760]  happening in the schools they're so far over the top out of fear and paranoia but this is reasonable
[03:27:52.760 --> 03:27:57.240]  when the kid acts the way that he does when he has something like this to well his dad is a his dad
[03:27:57.240 --> 03:28:03.400]  is a known activist in this area and he actually applied to become the president of cutter which
[03:28:03.400 --> 03:28:09.080]  is where the family now lives they moved there after you know experiencing this racism they now
[03:28:09.080 --> 03:28:16.680]  live in this country where his dad had ran for president you know from dallas twice so i mean
[03:28:16.680 --> 03:28:21.160]  obviously that's a little bit iffy so did he tell the kid oh yeah bring this bring your clock to
[03:28:21.160 --> 03:28:26.840]  school your teachers will love it and he actually admitted that he told the cops to leave the
[03:28:26.840 --> 03:28:31.640]  handcuffs on his son and told told him to turn around so he could take the picture that inflamed
[03:28:31.640 --> 03:28:37.480]  everyone and you know they knew what they were doing yeah yeah yeah i you know vote for me i'm
[03:28:37.480 --> 03:28:42.600]  a victim of american racism right and so we're gonna kind of get into that of how this is just
[03:28:42.600 --> 03:28:48.040]  sort of the political correctness run amok and it is destroying our country we got a university
[03:28:48.040 --> 03:28:54.280]  yoga class has been suspended over cultural appropriation they say that this yoga is an
[03:28:54.280 --> 03:29:00.040]  unacceptable cultural appropriation of a non-western practice and you know it's just from an email
[03:29:00.600 --> 03:29:05.000]  an email that a student wrote in and said oh this isn't appropriate so they cancel this
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:10.520]  yoga class that they've been teaching for since 2008 so all of a sudden you know it's bad and
[03:29:10.520 --> 03:29:15.400]  then we also have a bright barts reporting about an anti-racism rally that was planned at the
[03:29:15.400 --> 03:29:22.360]  university of colorado to show solidarity with mizu black activists but it was canceled because
[03:29:22.360 --> 03:29:29.560]  the events organizers were white and so they had to issue an apology um on behalf of the whiteness
[03:29:29.560 --> 03:29:34.600]  studies class who was putting forward this event they had to apologize to the black you know you're
[03:29:34.600 --> 03:29:38.840]  talking about this student activist speech on on friday you you touched briefly on the woodrow
[03:29:38.840 --> 03:29:44.280]  wilson uh censorship that's going on princeton university course woodrow wilson was a president
[03:29:44.280 --> 03:29:48.200]  of princeton before he came president of the u.s i don't want to see woodrow wilson we're on the
[03:29:48.200 --> 03:29:54.360]  large history we'll be right buyers on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:29:58.920 --> 03:30:02.840]  while isis threatens to attack the u.s record number of legal immigrants are flooding into the
[03:30:02.840 --> 03:30:07.000]  country thanks to lax enforcement by federal authorities barely a week after the november
[03:30:07.000 --> 03:30:12.280]  2015 isis attacks in paris france the us border patrol revealed that nearly 3000 unaccompanied
[03:30:12.280 --> 03:30:16.040]  children were caught crossing the border in the weeks leading up to the attacks but just think
[03:30:16.040 --> 03:30:19.560]  of how many more illegal immigrants were able to slip into the country without getting caught it's
[03:30:19.560 --> 03:30:24.120]  probably at least 10 times more speaking on the subject house representative duncan hunter said
[03:30:24.120 --> 03:30:28.120]  quote the greatest existential threat to this nation right now is this administration's open
[03:30:28.120 --> 03:30:33.000]  border policy hunter is speaking the truth isis is likely already exploiting president obama's
[03:30:33.000 --> 03:30:37.320]  open border policy to smuggle their own militants into the country but here's something else you
[03:30:37.320 --> 03:30:41.880]  may not realize human traffickers are also taking advantage of obama's open borders to
[03:30:41.880 --> 03:30:46.440]  enslave women around the world and import them as sex slaves into the u.s in other words obama's
[03:30:46.440 --> 03:30:51.400]  lax enforcement and immigration laws is fueling a war on women this is kit annals with info wars

[03:34:47.160 --> 03:34:52.280]  been in the jingle business for a very long time wrote music for times of commercials many major
[03:34:52.280 --> 03:34:57.800]  networks cbs evening news dan randa rather he co-sponsored a couple of killer tomatoes movies
[03:34:57.800 --> 03:35:01.640]  and he says after being offered a lot of money for a three-minute song pitching cigarettes to kids
[03:35:01.640 --> 03:35:06.680]  by the company with a famous cartoon mascot that was the straw that broke the camel's back so joining
[03:35:06.680 --> 03:35:13.560]  us now is neil fox welcome neil thank you good good to be on thanks i enjoy your uh your project
[03:35:13.560 --> 03:35:17.160]  here and again you know we can look at the different ways to get information out of people
[03:35:17.160 --> 03:35:20.760]  i've always said that documentaries i think are one of the best ways to wake people up
[03:35:20.760 --> 03:35:24.440]  if they listen to the news on a daily basis whether it's our radio show whether it's our
[03:35:24.440 --> 03:35:29.640]  nightly news we're telling them information that they can use but it we cannot always go back and
[03:35:29.640 --> 03:35:34.120]  provide the the background the foundation to get them to understand what they're hearing and it's
[03:35:34.120 --> 03:35:38.520]  something that's very different than they're hearing from the mainstream press so a documentary
[03:35:38.520 --> 03:35:45.080]  gives people the facts in a context uh it tells a story but it's still kind of didactic so if you
[03:35:45.080 --> 03:35:50.520]  got something that's dramatic that communicates with people on a visceral level but the downside of
[03:35:50.520 --> 03:35:55.080]  that is that they always have a happy hollywood ending so it really just kind of turns into a
[03:35:55.080 --> 03:35:59.720]  revelation of method so i really liked what you did because what yours is i guess is really kind
[03:35:59.720 --> 03:36:06.360]  of a musical documentary it's a a bunch of songs about different topics introducing those topics
[03:36:06.360 --> 03:36:10.840]  and it's a very digestible way to get this it gets to people viscerally plus they also get
[03:36:10.840 --> 03:36:15.400]  the information i really like the way you present that oh thanks yeah we we had a tough time while
[03:36:15.400 --> 03:36:21.240]  i was creating and figuring out what to call it because if we called it a musical documentary
[03:36:21.240 --> 03:36:26.920]  people might think it was a documentary about musicals yeah or or something to do with music
[03:36:27.480 --> 03:36:33.000]  and it's not that at all it's just it's a very i think it might be one of a kind i'm not really
[03:36:33.000 --> 03:36:38.760]  sure but when i enter in film festivals i put it on the documentary uh sometimes they get it sometimes
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:44.360]  they go like what the hell is this and just turn it off well i like it because the music is really
[03:36:44.360 --> 03:36:49.960]  kind of front and center and it besides the dvd uh you know there's uh the the songs themselves
[03:36:49.960 --> 03:36:53.400]  and like i said i really like the lyrics like one of them let me just read this it's a very
[03:36:53.400 --> 03:36:58.360]  short lyrics the plan it's the final season since it all began the night has come to take us with
[03:36:58.360 --> 03:37:03.480]  this master plan some of us won't make it some of us won't understand but a hero's been growing in
[03:37:03.480 --> 03:37:09.080]  the common man and i you're you're totally awake and it's a great project to wake other people up
[03:37:09.080 --> 03:37:14.760]  and just like that last that that song we came in with uh three three buildings two planes we
[03:37:14.760 --> 03:37:19.640]  really need to hammer that into people you know if you tell them enough times you sing it to them
[03:37:19.640 --> 03:37:24.840]  and kind of get that jingle in their head uh then they might uh yeah three three uh three
[03:37:24.840 --> 03:37:29.960]  buildings two planes well you know that was i was in the jingle business as you know for uh
[03:37:29.960 --> 03:37:37.480]  maybe 15 20 years i don't like to really think about it but i kind of got zeroed into the whole
[03:37:37.480 --> 03:37:43.080]  mental um the headspace of how do you get something across to people really really fast
[03:37:43.080 --> 03:37:48.120]  and simple especially if they're you know the kind of people that only listen to sound bites or
[03:37:48.120 --> 03:37:53.960]  they're they're kind of drugged up or you know just uh in a semi hypnotic state due to television
[03:37:53.960 --> 03:37:59.880]  and you know that kind of thing and so i really wanted it to make this product for the kind of
[03:37:59.880 --> 03:38:04.600]  people who we really need you know we've been preaching to the choir probably 90 of the time
[03:38:05.400 --> 03:38:09.960]  and we're not going to do anything unless we get more people involved in in freedom in the fight
[03:38:09.960 --> 03:38:16.440]  yeah so i thought we needed an undercut because a lot of people watch a show like yours and you
[03:38:16.440 --> 03:38:21.240]  know if they're not ready for it if if they're kind of you know half asleep they'll hear one piece
[03:38:21.240 --> 03:38:25.480]  of information that they don't agree with or is a little too shocking and they'll just run away
[03:38:25.480 --> 03:38:29.960]  that'll be it they'll turn off that's right they won't look it up they won't yeah exactly exactly
[03:38:29.960 --> 03:38:32.760]  and they'll just walk away going oh that's nuts and i don't want to hear about it
[03:38:33.240 --> 03:38:37.480]  um i thought we needed an undercut because we really need to get more people involved and
[03:38:37.480 --> 03:38:43.320]  i thought the best way to do it is through entertainment through music through art animation
[03:38:43.320 --> 03:38:49.160]  i even have a little bit of dance at the end anything aesthetic you know to get them to sit
[03:38:49.160 --> 03:38:55.000]  through it and actually listen to the message and maybe by the end of it walk away with a few
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:59.800]  seeds in their minds and saying gee you know i didn't know about that maybe i should look that up
[03:38:59.800 --> 03:39:05.880]  because if that's true we better know about it absolutely i want to play several clips give people
[03:39:05.880 --> 03:39:11.560]  a taste of it and let's play another clip this one is from save us and it really kind of touches
[03:39:11.560 --> 03:39:17.240]  on the insanity of trading your liberty away making yourself more of a slave in the hopes that
[03:39:17.240 --> 03:39:19.880]  somehow the government's going to keep you safe let's play that clip
[03:39:47.240 --> 03:39:52.840]  falling to the ground the only way to win bring america down
[03:40:17.240 --> 03:40:25.000]  let's go back to neil i love that we've got the solutions for problems we create and from presidents
[03:40:25.000 --> 03:40:28.520]  down to clerks just one of the perks is we get to control you because this is how the game works
[03:40:30.520 --> 03:40:36.280]  thanks yeah that's one of my favorites um how the game works that's that whole thing basically
[03:40:36.280 --> 03:40:41.400]  is about false flag and you know hopefully that'll explain it to people who don't even know what a
[03:40:41.400 --> 03:40:46.120]  false flag is because the best way to stop the effectiveness of a false flag as i'm sure you
[03:40:46.120 --> 03:40:53.240]  know is is tell people what it is exactly they expose the magician's trick you know once you
[03:40:53.240 --> 03:40:58.040]  show the trick and you know how it works it's lost all of its magic exactly exactly and that's the whole
[03:40:58.840 --> 03:41:04.680]  my whole modus operandi for the for the film and i'm also doing art that goes along with the film
[03:41:04.680 --> 03:41:10.680]  with the same topics some of the arts in the film and hopefully i'll get into live performance
[03:41:10.680 --> 03:41:14.440]  i mean i you know hell i'd like to see this in concert and even off-broadway just
[03:41:14.440 --> 03:41:20.200]  just any way we can get the message out and actually put butts in the seat so they'll listen to it
[03:41:20.200 --> 03:41:23.880]  and they'll walk out of there you know they came in to see some entertainment maybe they
[03:41:23.880 --> 03:41:28.840]  thought it was a little controversial but they'll walk out thinking yeah exactly i mean they've got
[03:41:28.840 --> 03:41:34.760]  a full spectrum operation going they use every medium every format as well and we need to do
[03:41:34.760 --> 03:41:40.680]  that uh as well we're going to play a comedy clip here and of course we have a a comedy uh
[03:41:40.680 --> 03:41:45.080]  there's there's comedy there's tragedy there's all kinds of stuff uh different genres of music
[03:41:45.080 --> 03:41:50.680]  that you've got on here and of course so we've got a contest coming up uh of course ridicule as
[03:41:50.680 --> 03:41:57.080]  hillary well knows from sol linsky's rules for radicals ridicule as man's most potent weapon
[03:41:57.080 --> 03:42:03.640]  and so uh we're going to pour that on the top of hillary's head in uh in multiple ways and and as
[03:42:03.640 --> 03:42:08.440]  we go to this i think this could very well be the theme song for the presidential elections
[03:42:08.440 --> 03:42:12.840]  he's lying because you've got a whole string of presidents here in your animation uh setting on
[03:42:12.840 --> 03:42:18.520]  the piano the upright piano uh kind of swaying to the music you know from lbj all the way to
[03:42:18.520 --> 03:42:24.280]  obama and uh we're going to pick up with a one on w but before we do that i just got to say
[03:42:24.280 --> 03:42:28.840]  one of the things about live radio is just as we went to break i said i don't want to get rid of
[03:42:28.840 --> 03:42:32.760]  woodrow wilson i don't want to erase his name and it's like it's not because i like woodrow wilson
[03:42:32.760 --> 03:42:36.680]  folks and i'm going to get lots of cards and letters on this i know that he's the globalist
[03:42:36.680 --> 03:42:41.000]  who started all this interventionism i know he created the fed i know he created the income tax
[03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:46.680]  i don't want to erase his memory i want to keep him forever in effigy and so in that sense let's
[03:42:46.680 --> 03:43:09.640]  play a little bit uh from the debuah section of his line okay
[03:43:16.680 --> 03:43:27.800]  now look who's crying 200 000 innocents are lying in their grave now torture has been legalized
[03:43:27.800 --> 03:43:35.640]  the flag has lost its way they justify the killing due to all the life they say he's
[03:43:35.640 --> 03:43:47.080]  like
[03:43:48.280 --> 03:43:52.440]  i gotta say you know when i what got my interest was the cover letter when he sent it to me he said
[03:43:52.440 --> 03:43:56.120]  do you need to see another uh documentary on conspiracy theories of course you don't
[03:43:56.120 --> 03:43:59.080]  but there's plenty of people who aren't awake and they do need to see this other alright i'll
[03:43:59.080 --> 03:44:03.800]  take a look at it and when i took it home and uh showed my family do that a lot of times documentaries
[03:44:03.800 --> 03:44:08.280]  and uh we've got people of all different ages in our home and many times they don't like they
[03:44:08.280 --> 03:44:13.160]  don't make it to a documentary but we were all uh we were all watching this whole thing we enjoyed
[03:44:13.160 --> 03:44:19.320]  it we really did did they did they get to the part about the federal reserve yeah we we stopped at
[03:44:19.320 --> 03:44:22.840]  the point because it was after we'd already watched another movie so we only got halfway through
[03:44:22.840 --> 03:44:26.760]  and we said we'll have to pick this up but yeah we didn't get to that because we would have uh
[03:44:26.760 --> 03:44:30.760]  we would have censored that yeah that's not family oriented that part that's right that's right
[03:44:30.760 --> 03:44:35.560]  that's the only song in my in my 45 years of writing songs it's the only time i use the f bomb
[03:44:35.560 --> 03:44:40.200]  in the song and and because it was just too appropriate for the federal reserve i mean
[03:44:40.760 --> 03:44:46.040]  well we have so many different f agencies in washington i think we are totally f'd with
[03:44:46.040 --> 03:44:51.640]  these bureaucracies because yeah this is one of them after the other fcc the fda the uh so so
[03:44:51.640 --> 03:44:58.760]  and forth and so on um now there was a serious song that you had um my daughter weeps and you
[03:44:58.760 --> 03:45:04.280]  say this is a true story was this your daughter or someone you know or yeah i'm glad you asked uh it's
[03:45:04.280 --> 03:45:10.040]  my daughter sleeps and uh nobody a lot of people when i show it at film festivals they think it's
[03:45:10.040 --> 03:45:15.000]  my daughter it's my own personal story i've been married 45 years but as far as i know we don't have
[03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:20.440]  kids oh okay unless unless they want to went off to college really early i don't know but they don't
[03:45:20.440 --> 03:45:27.080]  call or anything so um no this is a story uh that i heard on the on the internet it was a true story
[03:45:27.080 --> 03:45:33.880]  somebody else's story and since i wrote that story um i i heard from so many people about how it
[03:45:33.880 --> 03:45:39.080]  happened to them or it happened to a nephew or or somebody of theirs and uh it's amazing it's just
[03:45:39.880 --> 03:45:44.360]  too many of this is too many stories like this are going on so yeah i'm glad you asked this it's
[03:45:44.360 --> 03:45:49.720]  not my personal story thank god well yes we have heard we cover these stories all the time unfortunately
[03:45:49.720 --> 03:45:54.520]  and of course many people have never heard even of the vaccine court i remember there was uh
[03:45:54.520 --> 03:46:00.680]  there's been a couple of tragic stories uh that surfaced through the vaccine court uh trying to
[03:46:00.680 --> 03:46:06.120]  get compensation for that people need to understand that the big pharmaceutical companies have been
[03:46:06.120 --> 03:46:11.560]  given legal immunity why would they do that if they have a safe and effective product let's play
[03:46:11.560 --> 03:46:27.480]  a little bit of this uh my daughter sleeps
[03:46:41.880 --> 03:46:47.400]  i sit in darkness and i watch my daughter sleep
[03:46:48.920 --> 03:47:01.800]  my beating heart's the only sound she is so good and kind she's always on my mind the only
[03:47:01.800 --> 03:47:15.480]  moments that i keep she hasn't looked at me or heard a word i said the flame of life's no longer
[03:47:15.480 --> 03:47:28.040]  there i'd give up everything if i could hear her sin if god would take my life instead
[03:47:28.040 --> 03:47:39.960]  she was a healthy child she sang and danced and smiled she called me daddy till that day
[03:47:42.840 --> 03:47:51.880]  i'm all i have to blame the outcome's all the same though she's so close she's far away
[03:47:51.880 --> 03:47:59.320]  i had some doubts about the science they proclaim
[03:48:00.920 --> 03:48:03.800]  they reassured me it's the law
[03:48:06.840 --> 03:48:15.640]  they said they know what's right i shouldn't try to fight i can't ignore that fatal flaw
[03:48:15.640 --> 03:48:24.760]  very very touching song and of course we've known of many cases where parents have testified that
[03:48:25.480 --> 03:48:30.520]  shortly after they had a vaccine it was like the light just went out of their children's eyes
[03:48:30.520 --> 03:48:37.240]  and you have that lyric there the flame of life no is no longer there yeah yes that song still
[03:48:37.240 --> 03:48:42.200]  gets me i wrote it uh well i worked on this project for almost three years and that was written
[03:48:42.200 --> 03:48:47.240]  quite a while ago into the project and still when i hear it it's it's really hard to listen to
[03:48:47.240 --> 03:48:52.760]  you know and that's the thing is as we've heard of of people whose whose children have
[03:48:53.880 --> 03:49:01.080]  immediately gone into a autistic situation after a vaccination we've also heard many stories of
[03:49:02.040 --> 03:49:06.840]  families where their children have uncontrollable seizures that run forever and ever and it's
[03:49:06.840 --> 03:49:12.680]  amazing to me that one of the only things that really addresses these uncontrollable
[03:49:12.680 --> 03:49:18.840]  seizures and we've had our very first exemption here even in texas for medical marijuana to address
[03:49:18.840 --> 03:49:24.120]  that particular case that case and that case only uncontrollable continuous seizures
[03:49:25.000 --> 03:49:30.600]  and that's caused by uh in many cases by these by vaccines an adverse reaction to a vaccine
[03:49:30.600 --> 03:49:37.960]  it's amazing to me that marijuana which could treat that is is made illegal and yet we are seeing
[03:49:37.960 --> 03:49:43.800]  guns held to people's heads to have them take the vaccines without their informed consent that is so
[03:49:43.800 --> 03:49:51.720]  incredibly upside down well welcome to planet earth yeah it is upside down i mean when i first
[03:49:51.720 --> 03:49:58.040]  started getting into this uh entered the rabbit hole uh probably about 30 years ago and but but
[03:49:58.040 --> 03:50:03.320]  maybe 10 years ago was when i really got into it up to my eyeballs uh it's just amazing how
[03:50:03.320 --> 03:50:08.360]  everything i have learned just about is completely the opposite of of what i was taught and what i
[03:50:08.360 --> 03:50:13.400]  thought i mean i actually grew up a liberal believe it or not now i don't label myself liberal or
[03:50:13.400 --> 03:50:18.840]  conservative i i i don't think the labeling is a good idea i'd just rather yeah look for the truth
[03:50:18.840 --> 03:50:24.360]  you know yes that's how they control you they get you to buy into uh one of their two choices
[03:50:24.360 --> 03:50:30.280]  yeah yeah exactly and as long as they keep us fighting with each other they can be over here
[03:50:30.280 --> 03:50:34.120]  unnoticed and we could we keep fighting over here and they could do whatever they want over here
[03:50:34.120 --> 03:50:37.720]  because we're just fighting with each other we don't even get to see what's going on behind the
[03:50:37.720 --> 03:50:43.320]  curtain absolutely we're talking to neil fox with the conspiracy project it's his musical

[03:54:21.880 --> 03:54:33.080]  unsought by the military industrial complex
[03:54:33.080 --> 03:54:44.280]  something is wrong
[03:54:46.520 --> 03:54:50.920]  and you're listening to the music of neil fox from his conspiracy project it's a musical
[03:54:50.920 --> 03:54:57.160]  documentary we've been talking to him this last segment and uh he'll be joining us here in just
[03:54:57.160 --> 03:55:04.360]  a moment that's very appropriate i think on the day after the 52nd anniversary of jfk we
[03:55:04.360 --> 03:55:09.800]  we look at that we look at the starts out with the uh william colby uh at the church hearings
[03:55:09.800 --> 03:55:15.080]  talking about cia control the media jfk quotes on secret society eisenhower on the military
[03:55:15.080 --> 03:55:20.440]  industrial complex and then you see this all in the context of the police state police state
[03:55:20.440 --> 03:55:24.760]  violence that song is a blood on the horizon i want to go back to neil fox in just a moment

[03:56:08.120 --> 03:56:15.400]  discount i want to go back to uh neil fox uh neil when i uh looked at that um as i just we're
[03:56:15.400 --> 03:56:20.920]  talking about uh the clip that we came in with uh blood on the horizon we'll look at the police
[03:56:20.920 --> 03:56:28.760]  state violence i think it's uh people need to see that context going back to uh the 1970s and beyond
[03:56:28.760 --> 03:56:35.240]  the 1960s the 1950s with eisenhower to understand really the roots of the police state to understand
[03:56:35.240 --> 03:56:39.960]  that this isn't racism it's really rooted in globalism and that kind of violence i think when we
[03:56:39.960 --> 03:56:47.160]  look at this in terms of race uh what we do is we isolate uh black people and we they isolate
[03:56:47.160 --> 03:56:51.720]  themselves uh from the problem saying that's only their problem only then you know they're the only
[03:56:51.720 --> 03:56:56.120]  ones who are suffering from this we need to all come together and fight what you're depicting in
[03:56:56.120 --> 03:57:02.680]  that video absolutely we're talking about human rights yes you know not uh segmented rights for
[03:57:02.680 --> 03:57:09.240]  this group or that group uh once you talk about human rights you've included everybody um of course
[03:57:09.240 --> 03:57:14.920]  i guess maybe people who like dolphins may be upset i don't know so long thanks for all the fish
[03:57:14.920 --> 03:57:23.160]  right yeah i read the same book it's good um but uh and i don't mean to cast to cast any aspersions
[03:57:23.160 --> 03:57:28.680]  on dolphins i love dolphins this is one of my closest friends but uh seriously it's it's a human
[03:57:28.680 --> 03:57:34.520]  rights issue and uh as long as we can keep it in that context we stop putting out these little
[03:57:34.520 --> 03:57:40.680]  fires and we start concentrating on on where the source of the problem is instead of just these little
[03:57:40.680 --> 03:57:47.480]  sidetracked things i mean yeah you gotta you gotta have human rights for for minorities for
[03:57:47.480 --> 03:57:54.200]  different nations different countries uh whatever your sexual persuasion or whatever whatever you
[03:57:54.200 --> 03:57:59.960]  think if you're a human you should have rights and you're covered by the fight for human rights
[03:57:59.960 --> 03:58:04.600]  and uh that has got to be our main focus i think absolutely and we need to all come together as
[03:58:04.600 --> 03:58:10.760]  you point out we need to have a large awakening a large movement whenever i see people standing up
[03:58:10.760 --> 03:58:14.600]  for their rights as an individual they get clobbered they get hammered by that police state but if
[03:58:14.600 --> 03:58:19.320]  they stand up collectively because they understand what's going on the police state will back down
[03:58:19.320 --> 03:58:24.360]  i've seen that happen multiple times your documentary is yet another way for people to wake up thank you
[03:58:24.360 --> 03:58:29.240]  so much neil fox and the documentary is the conspiracy project you can find it at conspiracy
