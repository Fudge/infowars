[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:42.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  Well, my friends, we are back.
[00:45.000 --> 00:53.000]  It is another global transmission against tyranny on this Wednesday, the 12th day of October, 2011 edition.
[00:53.000 --> 00:57.000]  And we're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:57.000 --> 01:01.000]  I know I have some guests tonight on Info Wars Nightly News that are lined up.
[01:01.000 --> 01:08.000]  We're working on a couple of guests that are topical to news that's unfolding right now, but they are not in the boat yet.
[01:08.000 --> 01:13.000]  So we'll pretty much just have open phones today, which I'm leaning towards doing to begin with.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  We're not working too hard on guests because I want to hear from you and have time to cover all of the news.
[01:18.000 --> 01:31.000]  Wow, everything is transpiring, unfortunately, as we predicted it would, to a nauseating level for those of us that are awake and aware of the global agenda.
[01:31.000 --> 01:47.000]  You look at the sheep, all the blind, dumbed-down public who has no idea what's going on. It's very sad to watch them swat it around like a large alley cat plays with a tiny field mouse, gnawing on it, swatting it with its claws,
[01:47.000 --> 02:01.000]  watching the blood trickle as it squirms in pain and agony, the cat vampirically feeding on the fear pouring out of the tiny, diminutive creature.
[02:01.000 --> 02:08.000]  I would really like this torturous situation to turn around.
[02:08.000 --> 02:17.000]  I'd really like to route the scum, and history has shown that if we boldly tell people what's going to happen and it happens, our credibility will rise,
[02:17.000 --> 02:29.000]  and the people will listen to our historical analysis and our historical solutions, and that we can defeat the wicked before they fully take over the society and set up a stylistic,
[02:29.000 --> 02:42.000]  mawistic, hitleristic, pulpottish type mass murder house, which for the psychopaths of tyranny is beautiful.
[02:42.000 --> 02:52.000]  I don't find their spectrum, their crack of doom, their hellish vortices to be beautiful.
[02:52.000 --> 03:05.000]  I find it to be extremely painful to have to look into and focus on to understand it, and yes, it has left me twisted 18 years of studying evil.
[03:05.000 --> 03:15.000]  I am certainly a tortured soul, but the rest of our republic and the rest of the world is also tortured by this, even if you're not conscious of it,
[03:15.000 --> 03:23.000]  your subconscious mind, your spirit, your soul, your cord, your discernment, your deeper regions of the brain,
[03:23.000 --> 03:32.000]  all of the deeper facets of the mind and of the being, the body, are all too aware of the things happening.
[03:32.000 --> 03:42.000]  We hide a lot of ourselves, but the truth still stares back from the abyss, does it not?
[03:42.000 --> 03:51.000]  Okay, let me just break down the fact for those of you that just joined us, that we have a big broadcast lined up for you today.
[03:51.000 --> 03:58.000]  To say the least, in the words of James Dillingpole, writing for the London Telegraph,
[03:58.000 --> 04:20.000]  Australia has committed suicide if they implement this, they have committed absolute insider feudal taxes on all human activity, they have passed and expanded huge carbon taxes on all human activity.
[04:20.000 --> 04:31.000]  So that is coming up today, and I'm going to tie that in here in Austin, Texas, they're not going to build a big skyscraper downtown,
[04:31.000 --> 04:45.000]  because the city panel has voted to save downtown tree, a pecan tree, and so now people can't build on their own property.
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  Of course, if you're a globalist, you get a waiver to that, that's not even the news though, we have giant news on Fast and Furious,
[04:52.000 --> 05:18.000]  they're trying to smoke screen with a terror threat out of Iran, we're going to get into the 999 and more.
[05:22.000 --> 05:28.000]  See, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[05:31.000 --> 05:39.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  I can't stress this enough, you should at least watch this free video online today.
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[05:47.000 --> 05:54.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's End of America, the number 3.com.
[05:54.000 --> 06:00.000]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com, that's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:02.000]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[06:02.000 --> 06:07.000]  Alex has told you about the amazing, great tasting, long-term, storeable food from eFoodsDirect,
[06:07.000 --> 06:15.000]  and how a food savings account is your best insurance against natural disasters, job loss, and high food costs.
[06:15.000 --> 06:22.000]  But did you know that this dehydrated food also protects you against food-borne contaminants like E. coli and Salmonella?
[06:22.000 --> 06:26.000]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low-moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[06:26.000 --> 06:29.000]  Ask for the Alex Fall Special.
[06:29.000 --> 06:34.000]  The Fall Special is a 24-day supply of food in a convenient, portable container.
[06:34.000 --> 06:42.000]  A $259 value for only $199 saves $60 on 160 servings of the best food on the planet.
[06:42.000 --> 06:50.000]  Call 800-409-5633 and ask for the Alex Fall Special and go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[06:50.000 --> 06:57.000]  Call 24 hours 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex.
[06:57.000 --> 07:00.000]  You can bet your life on eFoodsDirect.
[07:01.000 --> 07:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[07:05.000 --> 07:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[07:13.000 --> 07:19.000]  We have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[07:19.000 --> 07:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[07:24.000 --> 07:28.000]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're asking for more matches.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[07:41.000 --> 07:43.000]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[07:43.000 --> 07:48.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.
[07:53.000 --> 08:05.000]  Or watch it online right now in superhighqualityatprisonplanet.tv.
[08:05.000 --> 08:10.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:17.000 --> 08:30.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:30.000 --> 08:38.000]  Well, it is Wednesday. It is the 12th day of October 2011.
[08:38.000 --> 08:46.000]  And Kurt Haskell, the lawyer who barely survived the wicked underwear bombing two Christmases ago along with his wife,
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  he'd been called as the only witness by the underwear bomber.
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.000]  Haskell asked me privately what I thought was going on.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  And I said, he's being threatened, his family, other things.
[08:58.000 --> 09:03.000]  He doesn't play along with the Patsy plot that he's been set up in.
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  That's the past MO. That's how the globalists operate over and over again, generally.
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  They've got a few other permutations.
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  And I said, they're using you for leverage.
[09:11.000 --> 09:16.000]  He's threatening if he doesn't get a better deal, and if they don't back off,
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.000]  that he's going to go ahead and continue to fight this as not guilty and call you as a witness.
[09:22.000 --> 09:25.000]  And I said, I think it's leverage.
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  In fact, I told him when the show ended, when he was on Info Wars Nightly News the other night,
[09:29.000 --> 09:31.000]  after the interview, he said, what do you really think is going on?
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  And I said, he's using you for leverage.
[09:33.000 --> 09:37.000]  And I said, he might even change his plea.
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  I told Haskell that.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  And that indeed has happened today.
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.000]  Haskell would not tell me what he thinks is going on.
[09:46.000 --> 09:51.000]  Because he said that might be used to prejudice his testimony.
[09:51.000 --> 09:57.000]  They would say it was prejudiced or to discredit it if he was called as a lone witness for the underwear bomber.
[09:57.000 --> 10:06.000]  This is going to be breaking news when he joins us coming up here at the bottom of the hour.
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  I'm also working on getting James Dillingpole on from the Telegraph.
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  He's got the headline today that Australia commits suicide.
[10:13.000 --> 10:16.000]  And I've just been told Dillingpole will be on with that.
[10:16.000 --> 10:21.000]  Protesters disrupt questions time after carbon bill passes lower house.
[10:21.000 --> 10:22.000]  And it's totally unpopular.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  I've seen polls of close to 90%.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  The governments have been removed the last five years over this.
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  They're laying half the farmland off limits in Australia already.
[10:33.000 --> 10:37.000]  And now this is home inspections, giant taxes.
[10:37.000 --> 10:40.000]  It's just unbelievable.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  And it has nothing to do with saving the earth.
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  They list carbon dioxide part of the life cycle.
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.000]  They list carbon dioxide part of the life cycle as a toxic waste.
[10:51.000 --> 11:00.000]  And then they can just control everything and tax everything selectively while giving waivers to inside globalist organizations.
[11:00.000 --> 11:11.000]  And more importantly, it then distracts from all the real environmental issues like toxic waste dumping, GMO cross species, hybrid clone chimeras.
[11:11.000 --> 11:29.000]  Now in the tens of thousands, glowing monkeys, glowing cats, fish that've got dozens of insect and other fish genes, mutagenic bacteria, viruses giving rise, pre-marker programming with antibiotics into shell walls for gene.
[11:29.000 --> 11:35.000]  Adherence, testing, already giving incredible rise to unbelievable mutagenic qualities.
[11:35.000 --> 11:40.000]  I mean, we are living in a petri dish of disaster here, a genetic Armageddon.
[11:40.000 --> 11:49.000]  And all of the surly know-it-all control freak scurrying around, talking about carbon dioxide that plants respirate from.
[11:49.000 --> 11:55.000]  That's by the way, very low in the atmosphere, 0.360.
[11:55.000 --> 12:02.000]  If it wasn't so dangerous to myself and my family and you, it would be hilarious.
[12:02.000 --> 12:05.000]  In fact, it is hilarious, but it's gallows humor.
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  I was at dinner with my parents last night, and my wife and children got tired, so they left.
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  And we sat around for about 30 minutes talking, and I was laughing about horrible things.
[12:12.000 --> 12:13.000]  My dad got offended.
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.000]  He was like, what are you?
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.000]  This is funny.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  I said, listen, it's gallows humor.
[12:19.000 --> 12:21.000]  I was like, it's not going to matter soon, dad.
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  They're going to release these nanotech engineered viruses they admit they've got that they can put in the food spray in the air.
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  They go in and attack receptor sites in the brain, giving you a selective lobotomy where you can't even get upset anymore.
[12:33.000 --> 12:36.000]  They're calling it anti-stress vaccines, anti-drug vaccines.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  And I predict they're already releasing them.
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  I've seen some evidence of that, but they're testing lower forms of them and we're screwed.
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.000]  I mean, it's over.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  Just total psycho world.
[12:46.000 --> 12:48.000]  And unless we totally wake up.
[12:48.000 --> 12:53.000]  And I started laughing about it because it's all I can do where I'm going to cry.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  Oh God, help me.
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  Is there no end to it?
[13:00.000 --> 13:09.000]  By our naivete, we have allowed the most evil people you can imagine in history to be in control of society.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  And I watch Mitt Romney.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  I watch Herman Cain.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  I watch Rick Perry.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  Chris Christie.
[13:17.000 --> 13:27.000]  That demonic monster being hailed as great conservatives when all of these men have worked deeply for the New World Order,
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  going to Bilderberg, heading up the Federal Reserve, writing socialist healthcare bills.
[13:32.000 --> 13:34.000]  I haven't even pointed out.
[13:34.000 --> 13:40.000]  I finally went this morning because I heard it brought up last night about one of Romney's weak points as his anti-gun.
[13:40.000 --> 13:46.000]  And I knew he wasn't pro-gun, but I didn't know he was basically for banning owning handguns.
[13:46.000 --> 13:51.000]  I mean, we might as well elect Dennis Kasenich as the Republican nominee.
[13:51.000 --> 13:57.000]  I like Dennis at certain levels because he's this guy who really believes in what he's saying and is against some Wall Street corruption.
[13:57.000 --> 14:01.000]  I think he really believes in what he stands for.
[14:01.000 --> 14:08.000]  Even if I don't agree with a lot of what he says, at least the fact that he is the same over time, you know, that's a positive thing.
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  But I wouldn't vote for Dennis Kasenich.
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  He says ban handguns. Mitt Romney does.
[14:16.000 --> 14:21.000]  And I've got to watch Republicans go, well, Mitt Romney looks presidential.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  So he wrote the healthcare bill.
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  So he's for gun control.
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  So he's praised for supporting carbon taxes.
[14:28.000 --> 14:34.000]  And I get emails from weirdo Romney supporters telling me I'm lying about this and stuff.
[14:34.000 --> 14:38.000]  Look, he's even worse than I thought.
[14:38.000 --> 14:51.000]  I remember years ago telling you that he worked for Al Gore, Perry, and that he was for open borders and amnesty and sanctuary cities and free tuition and on and on and on, anchor baby funding, everything.
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  But he went to Bilderberg and he supported all this stuff.
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  He supported Hillary care.
[14:56.000 --> 15:02.000]  And people would just say you're a liar and I'd get attacked by the Dallas blog and others saying I was making it up.
[15:02.000 --> 15:05.000]  Look, they know full well the truth.
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  They just play you like your idiots.
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.000]  And so I guess I don't look as kindol-ish as Mitt Romney or Rick Perry.
[15:13.000 --> 15:17.000]  So people say, well, Alex doesn't look like a kindol.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  And so he must be the liar.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  Okay, whatever then.
[15:23.000 --> 15:32.000]  And Chris Christie, I mean, the fact that he would endorse Mitt Romney, that's everything you ever need to know about Chris Christie.
[15:32.000 --> 15:37.000]  He's got this blunt, fake, tough guy talk where we're going to cut the welfare.
[15:37.000 --> 15:39.000]  We're going to throw the welfare bums out on the street.
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  Great, throw them out on the street.
[15:42.000 --> 15:49.000]  But then don't support somebody who wants to take my second amendment right to protect my shelf from the people thrown out on the street.
[15:49.000 --> 15:58.000]  And don't talk about canceling infrastructure tunnels and things and how you're going to get our budget straight when you're supporting the banker bailouts and things for Wall Street.
[15:58.000 --> 16:09.000]  Because nothing, you could cut everything in the world and it wouldn't do anything to those derivatives that Mitt Romney and others have supported.
[16:09.000 --> 16:14.000]  I mean, Herman Cain last night said that he, I got some big breaking news.
[16:14.000 --> 16:18.000]  You know, I tend to not even cover the big breaking news when I get first on air.
[16:18.000 --> 16:26.000]  Most shows hype up how big that news is and how powerful I have a tendency to just drop bombshell after bombshell and not even point out it's bombshell.
[16:26.000 --> 16:29.000]  Which is a problem I have.
[16:29.000 --> 16:35.000]  I predicted the Justice Department would hype up terror threats as fast and furious breath down their neck.
[16:35.000 --> 16:44.000]  And guess what? It happened. Not that I'm smart. They got a playbook. I got the playbook.
[16:44.000 --> 16:54.000]  I mean, it's like the Patriots got in trouble years ago for sneaking into events and stealing playbooks from other teams and secretly videotaping playbooks.
[16:54.000 --> 16:59.000]  What do you think you do in a war? What do you think football is? It's a war.
[16:59.000 --> 17:06.000]  The biggest part of football is spying on the other teams, watching the tapes, getting their playbooks.
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.000]  It's like a nation of children.
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.000]  Well, I've got the globalist playbook. I read what they actually say in their councils.
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.000]  They've been so arrogant, they publish in limited runs, but they publish what they're doing to us.
[17:21.000 --> 17:27.000]  The CFR has written hundreds of times that I've read in their own publication how they're going to destroy America's set up a world government.
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  How they're going to bring in collectivism, carbon taxes, geoengineering, the whole nine.
[17:33.000 --> 17:41.000]  I'm sitting here reading their stinking playbooks, publishing their playbooks for you, showing them to you day after day.
[17:41.000 --> 17:47.000]  Herman Cain is a hardcore running back for the New World Order.
[17:47.000 --> 17:52.000]  Chris Christie is a big fat center.
[17:52.000 --> 18:03.000]  Rick Perry and Mitt Romney are both limp-wristed quarterbacks, you know, where they got two quarterbacks on the same team, and the system doesn't know which one to start.
[18:03.000 --> 18:08.000]  And they just might send that running back Herman Cain right through into the end zone.
[18:08.000 --> 18:18.000]  And conservatives are like, oh, we've won. Herman Cain, a guy that says he thinks the best Federal Reserve person he knows is Alan Greenspan.
[18:18.000 --> 18:24.000]  This is the guy who got rid of Glass-Steagall with Robert Rubin and the rest of them.
[18:24.000 --> 18:32.000]  Larry Summers, Jamie Diamond, Henry Paulson, he was the head of Goldman Sachs at the time.
[18:32.000 --> 18:38.000]  This whole crew, and Herman Cain's like, we didn't mess stuff up in the early 90s when I was the head of the Federal Reserve.
[18:38.000 --> 18:44.000]  When I was on the board, the head of the Kansas City Fed, that's made man level.
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  That's right beneath the top of the pyramid.
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.000]  And that's as high as it gets until you're an actual owner, like the Rothschilds of the Rockefellers.
[18:51.000 --> 18:54.000]  That's a king gopher, imperial legged.
[18:54.000 --> 18:56.000]  And I'm going to play this clip later.
[18:56.000 --> 18:59.000]  He's up there going, I really liked Alan Greenspan.
[18:59.000 --> 19:02.000]  He didn't cause all these problems that we got today.
[19:02.000 --> 19:11.000]  What? The guy he recommended is the current head of the Fed, Osama Ben Bernanke.
[19:11.000 --> 19:16.000]  Mr. Helicopter Ben, and he thinks we're all stupid.
[19:16.000 --> 19:25.000]  And Herman Cain gets up there in front of the whole world and says, well, I like the guy that didn't cause these problems, Alan Greenspan.
[19:25.000 --> 19:32.000]  It's like saying, you know, at Nuremberg, I moved, we met Hitler, a patron saint, because he fought against Hitler.
[19:32.000 --> 19:39.000]  He's the guy that set all this up, and then there they are throwing their current minion out of the bus, Ben Bernanke.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  Then he got caught in a lie by Ron Paul.
[19:42.000 --> 19:46.000]  He said, Ron, you're lying about me not liking the, you know, not wanting to audit the Fed.
[19:46.000 --> 19:48.000]  I've always said audit the Fed.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  And I never called people stupid that wanted that.
[19:50.000 --> 19:51.000]  We've got the audio clips.
[19:51.000 --> 19:53.000]  We've got Herman Cain's book.
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  I can't say misspoke there.
[19:55.000 --> 20:24.000]  You've misrepresented me, hoping that people won't go find out he's a big fat liar.
[20:26.000 --> 20:31.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[20:31.000 --> 20:36.000]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.000]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[20:50.000 --> 20:56.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns. Call 800-686-2237.
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  You don't need me to tell you that humanity is in a deep crisis.
[21:04.000 --> 21:06.000]  Everyone can feel it.
[21:06.000 --> 21:11.000]  We know a tectonic struggle is now taking place between the forces of freedom
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  and those who love darkness, bondage, and enslavement.
[21:15.000 --> 21:23.000]  Yes, my friends, evil is rising, but take heart for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[21:23.000 --> 21:29.000]  Recently, New World Order operative Hillary Clinton admitted they're losing the Info War.
[21:29.000 --> 21:33.000]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.
[21:33.000 --> 21:39.000]  The globalists are scared. They've overreached. The future of the Info War is in your hands.
[21:39.000 --> 21:46.000]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv, download the thousands of special video reports, e-books, and more,
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  and get them out to everyone you know.
[21:48.000 --> 21:52.000]  Continue to spread the word about the broadcast on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter,
[21:52.000 --> 21:55.000]  and every other globalist propaganda platform.
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  We are going to use their system against them.
[21:57.000 --> 22:21.000]  The Info War now goes into high gear.
[22:27.000 --> 22:52.000]  The Info War now goes into high gear.
[22:52.000 --> 23:18.000]  The Info War now goes into high gear.
[23:18.000 --> 23:38.000]  The Info War now goes into high gear.
[23:38.000 --> 24:00.000]  The Info War now goes into high gear.
[24:08.000 --> 24:36.000]  The Info War now goes into high gear.
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.000]  All right, we are back live. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[24:41.000 --> 24:46.000]  You know, we've got a huge information that's going to be breaking here
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.000]  with the lone witness that was going to be called by the underwear bomber
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  who was gotten on the plane by the U.S. government, and that's admitted.
[24:56.000 --> 25:03.000]  Underwear bomber, guilty plea, shields government complicity reveals
[25:03.000 --> 25:08.000]  the fact that the government is desperate for this not to come to court
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  and to a jury.
[25:10.000 --> 25:16.000]  Reversal means identity of well-dressed man will remain unknown.
[25:16.000 --> 25:23.000]  That's a Paul Joseph Watson article at infowars.com right now.
[25:23.000 --> 25:25.000]  Kurt Haskell is coming up in the next segment.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  Then at the start of the next hour for one segment,
[25:28.000 --> 25:33.000]  James Dillingpole joins us to track the global government's main taxing system.
[25:33.000 --> 25:37.000]  That, of course, is the carbon tax allied with a VAT and sales tax.
[25:37.000 --> 25:42.000]  Anyone proposing that, you know, works for the private central banks,
[25:42.000 --> 25:49.000]  like Herman Cain with the 999, which is going to be the 2020 and the 303030.
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  The OECD that is the receivership arm for the big central banks,
[25:54.000 --> 25:58.000]  said they want around a global 90% tax rate on the general population
[25:58.000 --> 26:02.000]  to totally control every facet of your life.
[26:02.000 --> 26:07.000]  And so it will end up being the 303030 plan and, of course,
[26:07.000 --> 26:10.000]  will have federal control in every country over every facet,
[26:10.000 --> 26:14.000]  every purchase you make, tracking the sales taxes, tracking all industry.
[26:14.000 --> 26:21.000]  New bureaucracy as if the gates of bureaucratic Hades are opened.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  That is all coming up.
[26:23.000 --> 26:32.000]  Now, after we get this update from Kurt Haskell, I'll take some calls.
[26:32.000 --> 26:39.000]  Then after we get a little update from Dillingpole, I'll take some calls.
[26:39.000 --> 26:42.000]  But after Dillingpole leaves us at 20 after next hour,
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  I'm going to get them on for one segment,
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  because I've got a long way to go in the short time to get there.
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  I'm going to get to our top story today.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  And this is so big.
[26:50.000 --> 26:53.000]  I'm going to play the clips of Herman Cain caught lying,
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  and the clips of him saying what he said he didn't say,
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  and it's in his book as well.
[26:57.000 --> 27:00.000]  Ron Paul said, hey, you said we don't need to audit the Fed, Herman Cain.
[27:00.000 --> 27:01.000]  That's ridiculous.
[27:01.000 --> 27:02.000]  I never said that.
[27:02.000 --> 27:04.000]  I dare you.
[27:04.000 --> 27:05.000]  What a con man.
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  And Ron Paul goes, we'll have to get that then, Herman,
[27:08.000 --> 27:11.000]  because they're going to use that clip from the,
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  you watched from that debate last night.
[27:14.000 --> 27:17.000]  They're going to cut to Cain saying it all.
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  And his book.
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  Not just saying it repeatedly.
[27:21.000 --> 27:24.000]  We've got the book where he says exactly what Ron Paul said.
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  The doctor focused with precision,
[27:26.000 --> 27:29.000]  looking down at the quote and looks back at me and goes,
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  okay, Herman.
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  We're going to get you just like we got Rick Perry,
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  just like we're going to get Mitt Romney.
[27:35.000 --> 27:40.000]  And his fellow traveler, Chris, I love gun control
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.000]  and open borders and everything else, Christy.
[27:43.000 --> 27:47.000]  And I love austerity because, hey, he signed on to Mitt Romney.
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  That means he's endorsing all of that.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  Gun control, open borders, carbon taxes, Obama healthcare.
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.000]  You mean to keep going on with Mitt Romney?
[27:58.000 --> 28:01.000]  The anointed one.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  His big brokerage firm company used to be tied in,
[28:04.000 --> 28:07.000]  was pretty much the dominant owner of Clear Channel.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  It's not anymore, but that's why there's this vestigial
[28:10.000 --> 28:12.000]  groveling for him and talk radio.
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  He's the former boss.
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  I guess I could get down on my knees and lick Mitt Romney's boots
[28:18.000 --> 28:20.000]  and everybody want to put me on more radio stations,
[28:20.000 --> 28:23.000]  but I don't care.
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  You know, I talked about Fox News and different news articles
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  making little jokes about me.
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.000]  Seeing Alex wants to work here, but we don't want him.
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  So now when people call me up and say,
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  I want you to come on Fox News as a guest,
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  I have to tell them no.
[28:37.000 --> 28:40.000]  Including one of my friends who I don't think's too happy
[28:40.000 --> 28:44.000]  over the fact that I've refused.
[28:44.000 --> 28:55.000]  But that's fine because I have to separate myself from Babylon.
[28:55.000 --> 28:58.000]  They want you to think they're the only game in town desperately
[28:58.000 --> 29:00.000]  when they're a joke.
[29:00.000 --> 29:05.000]  They're a hollow, rotten pumpkin on the side of the road.
[29:05.000 --> 29:10.000]  A jack-o'-lantern, a burnout puppet.
[29:10.000 --> 29:15.000]  Now, the big news, by the way, that's coming up in the next hour.
[29:15.000 --> 29:19.000]  The big news all ties together.
[29:19.000 --> 29:25.000]  ISSA has issued the subpoena to Holder in fast and furious investigation.
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  And I've got the subpoena here in my hot little hands,
[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  but that's not the issue.
[29:31.000 --> 29:35.000]  Two days ago, when it came out, they were going to issue this subpoena.
[29:35.000 --> 29:37.000]  A day later, they made this announcement.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  Iran, working with Mexican drug cartels, was going to attack America.
[29:42.000 --> 29:47.000]  A purely manufactured smokescreen for Holder, and we called it.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  Stay with us.
[29:49.000 --> 29:53.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[29:53.000 --> 29:57.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.000 --> 30:03.000]  Hi, folks. This is Alex Jones.
[30:03.000 --> 30:08.000]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognized risk.
[30:08.000 --> 30:10.000]  Saving means to make money.
[30:10.000 --> 30:13.000]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars
[30:13.000 --> 30:17.000]  and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated
[30:17.000 --> 30:19.000]  and twice as good as what you're using now.
[30:19.000 --> 30:24.000]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes,
[30:24.000 --> 30:27.000]  perfumes deodorants, or antibacterials.
[30:27.000 --> 30:30.000]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents
[30:30.000 --> 30:35.000]  that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[30:35.000 --> 30:38.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before,
[30:38.000 --> 30:40.000]  you had to do something you've never done before.
[30:40.000 --> 30:45.000]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091
[30:45.000 --> 30:48.000]  or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[30:48.000 --> 30:53.000]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091
[30:53.000 --> 31:00.000]  or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[31:28.000 --> 31:31.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[31:31.000 --> 31:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[31:35.000 --> 31:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[31:40.000 --> 31:44.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[31:44.000 --> 31:45.000]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[31:45.000 --> 31:49.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[31:51.000 --> 31:56.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[31:56.000 --> 32:00.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[32:00.000 --> 32:07.000]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[32:07.000 --> 32:12.000]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[32:12.000 --> 32:16.000]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[32:16.000 --> 32:20.000]  where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[32:20.000 --> 32:29.000]  They soak right in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[32:29.000 --> 32:34.000]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[32:34.000 --> 32:39.000]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[32:39.000 --> 32:43.000]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans,
[32:43.000 --> 32:46.000]  made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[32:46.000 --> 32:50.000]  Diamond Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.000]  so you can ride all day with confidence.
[32:52.000 --> 32:55.000]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[32:55.000 --> 33:17.000]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.000]  He never was a hero, or this county shined in light.
[33:30.000 --> 33:37.000]  But you could always find him standing up for what he thought was right.
[33:37.000 --> 33:43.000]  He'd say you've got to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything.
[33:43.000 --> 33:49.000]  You've got to be your own man, not a puppet on the street.
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  There's only one of those men in this race.
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.000]  You've got to compromise what's right, and uphold your family name.
[33:56.000 --> 34:02.000]  You've got to stand for something, or you'll fall for anything.
[34:02.000 --> 34:08.000]  Like Herman Cain up there lying, saying he never said we don't need to audit the Fed.
[34:08.000 --> 34:11.000]  Or saying he didn't call people that wanted an audit, stupid.
[34:11.000 --> 34:15.000]  No, you only wrote that in your book and we've got all these video and audio clips of you.
[34:15.000 --> 34:19.000]  We'll be playing some of that next hour and on the nightly news tonight.
[34:19.000 --> 34:22.000]  That's how dumb Herman Cain thinks we are.
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  You've got a guy who might as well be Al Gore.
[34:26.000 --> 34:29.000]  Mitt Romney is that big government.
[34:29.000 --> 34:34.000]  Anti-gun, socialist healthcare, carbon tax loving.
[34:34.000 --> 34:35.000]  Look it up!
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  Chris Christie endorses him.
[34:37.000 --> 34:41.000]  That tells you all you know about that guy.
[34:41.000 --> 34:48.000]  Rick Perry, he's burning down right now as his past comes out.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  Normally I don't even obsess over presidential elections because it's all puppets.
[34:52.000 --> 34:58.000]  But we've got a real guy and he's an old man.
[34:58.000 --> 35:05.000]  He had an all cutesy cute for the ladies out there, like Mitt Romney or Herman Cain or somebody.
[35:05.000 --> 35:11.000]  But he's a real person who understood the real problems and has fought for 30 years against the Federal Reserve.
[35:11.000 --> 35:15.000]  And now it's all coming down to the wire right now.
[35:15.000 --> 35:23.000]  We'll still beat this tyranny even if Ron Paul loses and he's won by getting in there and speaking out and being involved and still has a great chance.
[35:23.000 --> 35:29.000]  But the system is cramming Herman Cain and Mitt Romney down our throat for a reason.
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  Because they work for the New World Order.
[35:31.000 --> 35:32.000]  Both of them.
[35:32.000 --> 35:36.000]  Look at the fruit of the tree of Ron Paul.
[35:36.000 --> 35:41.000]  Accurate, steadfast, sustaining, liberty loving.
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  Look at Herman Cain and Mitt Romney.
[35:43.000 --> 35:54.000]  Both high level generals working directly for the New World Order and endorsing all of its collectivist enslavement systems.
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  You know a prisoner lives in a collectivist system.
[35:56.000 --> 35:58.000]  They want you locked down.
[35:58.000 --> 35:59.000]  That's coming up.
[35:59.000 --> 36:06.000]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-25 at 9, 92-31, 800-25 at 9, 90-31.
[36:06.000 --> 36:15.000]  I told you they would come up with some fake crisis to try to make Holder look like a hero as it came out that he shipped guns to Mexico and allowed cocaine to be shipped back in.
[36:15.000 --> 36:19.000]  That's in the El Paso Times, Chicago Tribune, other papers.
[36:19.000 --> 36:24.000]  But now US Iran plotted with Mexican drug cartels to assassinate Saudi Ambassador.
[36:24.000 --> 36:26.000]  Then you read there's no proof.
[36:26.000 --> 36:31.000]  But see, it's drug cartels and Holder's fighting drug cartels.
[36:31.000 --> 36:32.000]  This is meant to just...
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  I thought he shipped guns to him.
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  He's the one fighting him.
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  Oh, it's the Iranians gave him the guns.
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  It's just meant to kind of...
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.000]  This is all designed for people that are kind of halfway paying attention.
[36:42.000 --> 36:52.000]  Once you learn, like Goebbels and Hitler said, good propaganda is dumbed down, boiled down, very simplistic for the lowest common denominator and those not paying attention.
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  So you're paying attention.
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  This is like what?
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.000]  They admit it wasn't a real plot and drug cartels are the Iranians and it's on the news.
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  We ought to go ahead and just nuke Iran right now.
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  I'm glad Israel's about to hit them.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  They wanted to blow up the Saudi Embassy.
[37:07.000 --> 37:16.000]  Oh, yeah, that's exactly what Iran would do and then have a pretext for the West to come in and blow the daylights out of them.
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  And again, I'm not saying Iran's great.
[37:18.000 --> 37:21.000]  The point is this is all a setup.
[37:21.000 --> 37:22.000]  That's coming up.
[37:22.000 --> 37:32.000]  Now, going to Kurt Haskell, who's had a lot of courage, survived the underwear bombing almost two years ago now, two Christmases ago.
[37:32.000 --> 37:38.000]  Saw the sharp dress man get the underwear bomber on the plane a month and a half later.
[37:38.000 --> 37:47.000]  The undersecretary of state admits, yes, an unnamed agency told them to help get him on, you know, basically get him his visa and the rest of it and help get him on the plane.
[37:47.000 --> 37:56.000]  And then all of a sudden, the underwear bomber who had fired his lawyers and said he was going to, you know, that he did it, but he was not guilty and was going to have a trial.
[37:56.000 --> 37:59.000]  Then he said, I'll call Kurt Haskell as my only witness.
[37:59.000 --> 38:04.000]  And I said, I thought it was for leverage somehow behind the scenes.
[38:04.000 --> 38:10.000]  Haskell asked me a few nights ago and he was on the TV show in Fort Worth.
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.000]  And he's what I thought.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.000]  I told him, I think that's probably what's happening.
[38:12.000 --> 38:23.000]  He wouldn't tell me at the time when he thought was happening because he didn't want them to be able to use that against him as a witness to try to try to discredit his testimony somehow.
[38:23.000 --> 38:31.000]  But we'll now find out from Kurt Haskell's, I haven't talked to him yet today and I appreciate him joining us for a short notice, exactly what he thinks has happened here in this wild case.
[38:31.000 --> 38:32.000]  Now there won't be a trial.
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  Now there'll be sentencing in early January.
[38:34.000 --> 38:39.000]  Here's the headline, underwear bomber, guilty plea, shields government complicity.
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.000]  Reversal means identity of well-dressed men will remain unknown.
[38:43.000 --> 38:46.000]  Kurt Haskell joining us via video connection from Michigan.
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  Kurt, what's your view on this, sir?
[38:49.000 --> 38:54.000]  Hey Alex, I'm not surprised at all.
[38:54.000 --> 39:00.000]  You know, just a couple days ago, Umar said in court that he's going to call me as his only witness.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  Obviously, the prosecution can allow that to happen.
[39:04.000 --> 39:08.000]  So I would expect a very lenient sense for Umar.
[39:08.000 --> 39:15.000]  I think the prosecution got in contact with him knowing that they did not want me to be on the stand.
[39:15.000 --> 39:18.000]  Umar gets a slap on the wrist case goes away.
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  So that's what I expect will happen here.
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.000]  So he's trusting them and I don't think he can probably do that.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  But that is what you said on there.
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  I said, what do you think is happening?
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  You said, well, I want to get fully into it, but this could be a way to get a plea deal.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  Then we talked some off air.
[39:34.000 --> 39:42.000]  What was your view that you didn't want to share with myself or others until the outcome was known?
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  Well, I just wasn't really sure.
[39:44.000 --> 39:48.000]  Honestly, I don't want to speculate because I hadn't talked to Umar.
[39:48.000 --> 39:55.000]  So, you know, you know, I expected that this was some sort of leverage he was using to get a lenient plea deal.
[39:55.000 --> 40:00.000]  You know, they've had plea negotiations for 22 months now with no plea deal.
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.000]  You know, and magically soon as he mentions my name that I'll be testifying.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  Oh, no, we have a plea deal.
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  It's not a coincidence.
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  That's the reason for the plea deal.
[40:10.000 --> 40:15.000]  I expect, you know, very, you get sends in January, I think, I think I heard this morning.
[40:15.000 --> 40:23.000]  So, you know, pay attention to when he sends it'll probably be conscious shock and how leaning his punishment is.
[40:23.000 --> 40:24.000]  I would expect.
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  And there'll be a right wing spin.
[40:26.000 --> 40:31.000]  You know, they gave that bomber only 20 years in prison.
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.000]  Well, I tell you, he'll be living in there watching cable TV and a hot tub.
[40:36.000 --> 40:43.000]  This old bomb went in truth, they're having to get him a lenient sentence because he was going to call you and you're right.
[40:43.000 --> 40:50.000]  No plea deal in 22 months, but they mentioned Kurt Haskell and boom, there's a plea deal right away.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  Yeah, it's not surprising at all.
[40:52.000 --> 40:59.000]  Actually, I was in court this morning, I wanted my own cases and I was talking with a couple of people that were down there.
[40:59.000 --> 41:06.000]  And as we were talking about this, I said, you know, I expect the plea deal and that I won't actually take the stand.
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  I get a tax that boom, there's a plea deal.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  So it's kind of, you know, expected.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  I was actually talking about it when I got notice of it.
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  So, well, you've got to write a book.
[41:15.000 --> 41:18.000]  So this is a testimony on record.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  And where do you go from here, Kurt?
[41:20.000 --> 41:23.000]  I mean, you you could have been killed you and your wife.
[41:23.000 --> 41:24.000]  You've tried to get justice.
[41:24.000 --> 41:31.000]  You said you were probably waiting in the past before you file a civil suit to see what happened with the trial.
[41:31.000 --> 41:38.000]  Now we see where this is going and what you've got up until Christmas Day to file the suit.
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  Is that coming?
[41:39.000 --> 41:40.000]  It's coming.
[41:40.000 --> 41:41.000]  Yeah.
[41:41.000 --> 41:42.000]  It's coming soon.
[41:42.000 --> 41:45.000]  I want to see what how this played out before I decided.
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  So I'm going to file a civil case.
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  So stay tuned for round two of hearings on this civil case.
[41:51.000 --> 41:57.000]  Oh, is this breaking news here? Kurt Haskell will file under his civil case by Christmas.
[41:57.000 --> 41:58.000]  I will.
[41:58.000 --> 41:59.000]  Yeah.
[41:59.000 --> 42:00.000]  Stay tuned.
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  I just have to write it up.
[42:02.000 --> 42:03.000]  Yeah.
[42:03.000 --> 42:06.000]  You know, I'm going to consult with an attorney friend.
[42:06.000 --> 42:14.000]  I have that civil attorney and I don't know if I'm going to file it with help of him or if he's going to take it and file it on behalf of me.
[42:14.000 --> 42:18.000]  It's not decided yet, but it'll be filed soon.
[42:18.000 --> 42:27.000]  Well, you certainly got standing. You're a victim and you witnessed all this and the government, obviously from what you saw, they helped get him on the plane.
[42:27.000 --> 42:35.000]  That right there is a bare minimum that you've got a serious negligence, willful, conscious.
[42:35.000 --> 42:39.000]  Well, it's not even it's complicity, but you can probably win better.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  I'm not an expert lawyer like you are, but I study this stuff.
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.000]  There's a whole, I mean, just ballpark right now.
[42:44.000 --> 42:49.000]  What are you looking at as different strategies?
[42:49.000 --> 42:58.000]  I'm going to file a section for, I believe it's 1983, 42 1983, the law I'm going to file under.
[42:58.000 --> 43:02.000]  It's for an intentional violation of your constitutional rights.
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  So that will be the section I go under.
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  If anyone wants to look at that.
[43:06.000 --> 43:16.000]  Putting you in danger in their sting operation, knowingly, I mean, because if the cops did a sting and a roller rink with a bunch of little kids, you know, the cops said, meet me here.
[43:16.000 --> 43:20.000]  I'm going to sell you cocaine at the roller rink and there's a shootout and kids get shot.
[43:20.000 --> 43:21.000]  They're definitely culpable.
[43:21.000 --> 43:22.000]  Is that what you're saying?
[43:22.000 --> 43:29.000]  No, what I'm saying is the government intentionally caused me emotional distress and that will be what my argument is.
[43:29.000 --> 43:32.000]  But they also almost killed you by helping him get on the plane.
[43:32.000 --> 43:45.000]  Right. Right. And under that law, I can also ask for punitive damages, which are damages I didn't necessarily incur, but are damages designed to punish the person or entity that causes this problem.
[43:45.000 --> 43:52.000]  So obviously I'll be asking for a significant amount of punitive damages, probably eight figures is what I'm thinking.
[43:52.000 --> 44:04.000]  But of course, the real goal here, I would imagine, is to make sure others aren't hurt in the future by these by these staged operations, but also you'll be able to fair it out quite a bit of truth in your lawsuit.
[44:04.000 --> 44:08.000]  Exactly. We still haven't gotten to the bottom of all the details.
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.000]  Laurie and I haven't, you know, we want we want the government to admit what they did.
[44:13.000 --> 44:15.000]  They're still hiding the fact of what they did.
[44:15.000 --> 44:16.000]  We want them to admit it.
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.000]  We want to have our reputations cleared.
[44:19.000 --> 44:23.000]  They've been smeared by the government over the past 22 months.
[44:23.000 --> 44:25.000]  We want the government to admit what they did.
[44:25.000 --> 44:30.000]  Obviously, you know, that's what we're going to be seeking as well as damages.
[44:30.000 --> 44:37.000]  Well, you'll be able to call the undersecretary of state Kennedy who in testimony said they were ordered to help him get on the plane.
[44:37.000 --> 44:44.000]  Then if he lies or declares national security, wow, this is going to get this is going to get really wild.
[44:44.000 --> 44:45.000]  Well, we'll see.
[44:45.000 --> 44:52.000]  I don't know, you know, you know, they could declare national security and throw my case out too.
[44:52.000 --> 44:53.000]  So who knows?
[44:53.000 --> 44:55.000]  I don't know. We'll see where it goes.
[44:55.000 --> 45:00.000]  But regardless, national security is called still your life was endangered.
[45:00.000 --> 45:01.000]  I mean, I just go to the common law.
[45:01.000 --> 45:04.000]  I'm not a lawyer, but I studied basic common law, basic common sense.
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  If you go back to the law, it's all there.
[45:06.000 --> 45:08.000]  I mean, they help get this guy on the plane.
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  That's been confirmed.
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  It all it could have killed you and all those other people.
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.000]  I hope others file lawsuits as well, not just you.
[45:16.000 --> 45:25.000]  Yeah, you know, hopefully some passengers will come out of the woodwork and and support us and maybe joining the lawsuit to nobody step forward yet.
[45:25.000 --> 45:34.000]  But of course, you know, that would be helpful if we had, you know, a significant amount of passengers joining the case instead of this warring on.
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  Well, thank God you spoke out.
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.000]  Thank God you were there.
[45:39.000 --> 45:46.000]  I mean, it's scary and dangerous, but that's the silver lining or we would have never known any of this.
[45:46.000 --> 45:51.000]  We could have suspected the classic staged event.
[45:51.000 --> 46:00.000]  But now we're hearing I ran with Mexican drug cartels and they admit no proof of this was going to try to blow up the Saudi embassy in the U.S.
[46:00.000 --> 46:01.000]  And then there's no proof.
[46:01.000 --> 46:04.000]  But oh, that's a good distraction for Holder.
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.000]  And it just happens to involve Mexican drug cartels drug cartels.
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.000]  He admittedly ordered guns to be shipped to and he's been caught perjuring himself.
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  I mean, I know this this just came out, Kurt.
[46:13.000 --> 46:24.000]  But what's your view on all these latest announcements that U.S. says I ran plotted with Mexican drug cartel to assassinate Saudi ambassador.
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  Boy, I honestly have no idea.
[46:26.000 --> 46:27.000]  I haven't read anything.
[46:27.000 --> 46:28.000]  I'm not yet.
[46:28.000 --> 46:31.000]  I've been so busy this week with everything going on.
[46:31.000 --> 46:37.000]  If it's underwear bomber case and my own cases and tigers in the playoffs that I've been going to.
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.000]  So I don't know that I can even comment on that.
[46:40.000 --> 46:41.000]  I want to read into a little bit.
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.000]  There's also a Suffolk County report just came out linking and testimony.
[46:45.000 --> 46:47.000]  Hillary Clinton to the gun walker.
[46:47.000 --> 46:50.000]  Of course, it's a Clinton project ordering that.
[46:50.000 --> 46:57.000]  Of course, her former minion deputy secretary of state deputy secretary of.
[46:57.000 --> 47:03.000]  The attorney general holder now is the attorney general, but he formerly worked for her as well.
[47:03.000 --> 47:09.000]  Listen, I've been asking the questions here, Kurt, but but in the time we've got left with you again, we appreciate your courage.
[47:09.000 --> 47:10.000]  Everything that's happened.
[47:10.000 --> 47:18.000]  Any other things you'd like to point out any other facets of this predictable chain of events?
[47:18.000 --> 47:26.000]  Well, you know, it's been really it's been really fascinating to go through this to see how all these things really play out.
[47:26.000 --> 47:36.000]  You know, I had no idea how things really work before I was kind of thrown into this underwear bomber case, not of my own doing.
[47:36.000 --> 47:41.000]  And it's been really fascinating to me to see how it all plays out with a predictable ending.
[47:41.000 --> 47:46.000]  Of course, that I never actually get to take the stand, which I expected.
[47:46.000 --> 47:56.000]  In some ways, I'm kind of relieved I was actually considering hiring a full-time bodyguard.
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  That was something I was probably going to do within the next week, you know, to protect me.
[47:58.000 --> 48:04.000]  Since I've got announced as being the sole witness last week, I really started to be more concerned with my safety.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  So in that regard, I'm kind of glad it's over.
[48:07.000 --> 48:14.000]  I'm kind of upset, though, that I won't be able to take the stand and blow this case wide open, but I can still file a civil case.
[48:14.000 --> 48:24.000]  So, you know, I can still get some more truth out of this and actually be in charge of the case myself.
[48:24.000 --> 48:29.000]  Sending subpoenas, asking the questions I want to ask in deputations and that sort of thing.
[48:29.000 --> 48:32.000]  So maybe that will actually be better for getting to the bottom of this.
[48:32.000 --> 48:36.000]  But, you know, other than that, you know, I don't know.
[48:36.000 --> 48:43.000]  I expect the sense will be very light, probably conscious, shocking how light it will be is what I expect.
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.000]  And, you know, it's beyond my control besides that.
[48:48.000 --> 48:52.000]  Well, you've already risked your life in more ways than one and people are praying for you.
[48:52.000 --> 49:01.000]  And we appreciate you having the courage to even go that extra mile and say that you're going to do the civil suit to try to get justice.
[49:01.000 --> 49:07.000]  And justice be done, may the heavens fall, even if it does bring down the State Department and the Justice Department.
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  In closing, I just want to bring this point up.
[49:09.000 --> 49:15.000]  You notice in the quote, extrajudicial killing of Amor Aulaki, the guy that secretly hangs out the Pentagon,
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.000]  that ran the underwear bomber and all these other guys, they never want trials now.
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  They just want to say we're killing somebody.
[49:22.000 --> 49:30.000]  But this is why you want trials is so that the facts can be heard when you have torture, when you have secret killing, secret arrest.
[49:30.000 --> 49:37.000]  Historically, you can't believe a word that comes out of those governments, whether it's the Soviets or the North Koreans or the Nazis.
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  I mean, this is really common sense.
[49:39.000 --> 49:45.000]  And it's just an example of why we do need trials so the facts can be seen.
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  You're exactly right.
[49:47.000 --> 49:56.000]  You know, once you start going down that path, then, you know, who's to watch over these people and make sure, you know, that they're actually guilty.
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  Amor Aulaki is killed without a trial.
[49:58.000 --> 49:59.000]  He's an American citizen.
[49:59.000 --> 50:03.000]  You have a right to a trial before you're executed.
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  It's ridiculous.
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  He's denied his right to an attorney, denied his right to a fair trial.
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  It's totally illegal.
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.000]  So, you know, if they can do that, what can't they do?
[50:15.000 --> 50:24.000]  You know, it's really problematic to me to see these things going on, since if the government just doesn't care about the Constitution or anybody's rights at all,
[50:24.000 --> 50:34.000]  you know, whether they're actually criminal or not, which, you know, has yet to be determined just because the government says someone is terrorist or criminal doesn't necessarily mean that they are.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  Maybe they're lying for some other purpose or...
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  Maybe their wife's being threatened.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  Maybe their family is.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  Maybe they've been set up.
[50:42.000 --> 50:51.000]  I mean, this has come out over and over again with McVeigh, Lee Harvey Oswald, you know, the gentleman that shot Martin Luther King.
[50:51.000 --> 50:54.000]  I mean, the evidence is there of how they set these things up.
[50:54.000 --> 51:00.000]  We have Operation Northwoods declassified where the Pentagon talked about how to bomb DC and even how to frame...
[51:00.000 --> 51:04.000]  Even how to frame Patsy's, but I've heard good old boys all over talk radio.
[51:04.000 --> 51:17.000]  I've, well, yesterday, Drudge linked to an article by Ron Paul that we post from his congressional site on infowars.com.
[51:17.000 --> 51:21.000]  And it was Ron Paul saying what other Americans are on the secret kill list.
[51:21.000 --> 51:28.000]  And normally about 90% of comments are positive, but about half of them were Ron Paul's a traitor, Alex Jones is a traitor.
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  How dare you not want to kill citizens that we know are terrorists.
[51:31.000 --> 51:39.000]  And just the mindlessness of we got to get these terrorists and people just willingly wanting to give up the shield of liberty.
[51:39.000 --> 51:47.000]  And now all across the board, we see just incredible excesses of government corruption caught framing people.
[51:47.000 --> 51:51.000]  Turns out more than a third of folks with DNA evidence on death row were innocent.
[51:51.000 --> 51:57.000]  And it turns out the state in case after case, they have one just up and came out in the death row thing on a round rock.
[51:57.000 --> 52:07.000]  North Austin, where they knew he was innocent for 20 years and we're trying to still make sure he was put to death and we're going and fighting his appeals, knowing he didn't do it.
[52:07.000 --> 52:11.000]  I mean, some of these prosecutors are some of the most soulless people.
[52:11.000 --> 52:20.000]  There's got to be a special place in hell, Kurt Haskell, reserved for people who know the truth and are willing to put innocent people in jail.
[52:20.000 --> 52:23.000]  And then they try to sell to the public that it's tough guy.
[52:23.000 --> 52:31.000]  And our founders were tough guys, the French and Indian war, all of it fighting the British biggest military on earth at the time, never been beaten.
[52:31.000 --> 52:34.000]  They were tough guys and they put these things in place.
[52:34.000 --> 52:39.000]  Okay, having liberty and freedom and checks and balances is not wimpy.
[52:39.000 --> 52:45.000]  As a lawyer, what's your view on that final statement, Kurt Haskell?
[52:45.000 --> 52:58.000]  We've gone from a government for the people by the people to a government that now controls the people, where the government tells us what's going to happen.
[52:58.000 --> 53:04.000]  I don't know how it's gone that way, but it's almost as if we're losing all of our rights.
[53:04.000 --> 53:09.000]  It's becoming Nazi Germany, part two.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  I don't know, maybe that would be a good comparison.
[53:11.000 --> 53:19.000]  The parallels are pretty similar if you look at Germany in the 1930s to what's going on in the United States in 2011.
[53:19.000 --> 53:23.000]  I think it's pretty similar, but you're right.
[53:23.000 --> 53:27.000]  It's almost as if we have no rights and we have a good segment of the population.
[53:27.000 --> 53:40.000]  Okay, with that, it pays no attention, sits back and watches their TV and watches American Idol and plays video games and doesn't pay any attention to what's really going on.
[53:40.000 --> 53:48.000]  Which is easy to do if you just look at the headlines of stories and don't think about them and look into them.
[53:48.000 --> 53:53.000]  Maybe that's what you would think, the lives by the media and the government.
[53:53.000 --> 53:58.000]  I don't know, the country's in a sad state right now.
[53:58.000 --> 54:09.000]  Well, if you watch old TV shows, even fiction or nonfiction like Twilight Zone or whatever it is, so many of them were based in futuristic police state authoritarian systems
[54:09.000 --> 54:13.000]  where there's secret arrest, secret torture, extra judicial executions.
[54:13.000 --> 54:22.000]  And it's always shown in what the old America was as incredibly dangerous and horrible and the opposite of freedom, which it is.
[54:22.000 --> 54:28.000]  But nowadays you watch these shows like 24 and others and man, it is cool to torture people, including their children.
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  Man, it is fun to frame people.
[54:30.000 --> 54:32.000]  It is really great.
[54:32.000 --> 54:41.000]  And it just shows how the establishment is trying to give us their evil corrupt mindset. It shows how America, to a great extent, has lost its soul.
[54:41.000 --> 54:47.000]  Kurt Askel, what's the best website for people to visit?
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  For my stories?
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  Yes, yes.
[54:50.000 --> 55:00.000]  You can always go on my blog, HaskellFamily.blogspot.com, which I've posted articles on going all the way back to Christmas Day 09,
[55:00.000 --> 55:03.000]  which was the day of the, you know, the attack of the underwear bomber.
[55:03.000 --> 55:11.000]  Yeah, the full saga is there at the HaskellFamily.blogspot.com?
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  Right, yeah, exactly.
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.000]  And of course, I'll be putting updates as I file a civil case and things go on with that case too.
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  So it may not be anything right away.
[55:21.000 --> 55:26.000]  It's something I'm working on though, and I'll be starting before Christmas time anyway.
[55:26.000 --> 55:31.000]  Well, Kurt, thank you for your courage again, and thank you for breaking the news that the civil suit will go forward.
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.000]  That is certainly newsworthy. Kurt Askel, thank you so much.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  Thanks, no problem, Alex.
[55:36.000 --> 55:41.000]  Well, we appreciate him giving us that time today.
[55:41.000 --> 55:46.000]  And he certainly now, I think, needs to take a few days off and relax a bit.
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  He's earned it before he gets back in the battle.
[55:48.000 --> 55:53.000]  We skipped that network break because that news was so hardcore and breaking here.
[55:53.000 --> 55:56.000]  Great job, the crew, getting him on such short notice.
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  I'm going to give you the number right now.
[55:58.000 --> 56:05.000]  It's 800-259-9231-800-259-9231.
[56:05.000 --> 56:10.000]  On any of the subjects I've raised, the lives of Herman Gaines saying he never said don't audit the Fed.
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  Right handed, that's coming up.
[56:12.000 --> 56:17.000]  Hillary, now it comes out, I'm going to get more into this, is behind the Fast and Furious.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  Gee, that's really a shocker.
[56:19.000 --> 56:24.000]  Clinton East is, that's their specialty is false flags to blame the Second Amendment.
[56:24.000 --> 56:28.000]  We've got a bunch of news on carbon taxes.
[56:28.000 --> 56:33.000]  We've got Occupy LA speaker saying violence will be necessary.
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  And I bet you a million bucks this guy's anti-gun.
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  They want your guns so they can have their way with you.
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  Don't ever forget that. He's a collectivist.
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  That's all coming up.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  Superhero gets arrested for breaking up a fight.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  The cops, the only cops are on to do that.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  You ever heard of a citizen's arrest?
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  I think it's stupid to be dressed up in a superhero outfit.
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.000]  Well, it kind of sells the idea of citizen taking action.
[56:54.000 --> 56:58.000]  Cops arrest people under citizen's arrest powers.
[56:58.000 --> 57:04.000]  Then under your incorporated system, you hire them to carry out the job of special training and equipment.
[57:04.000 --> 57:10.000]  So that's just more of the state trying to teach you that you don't have a right to defend yourself or a right to intervene.
[57:10.000 --> 57:13.000]  You don't just have a right, you have a duty under common law.
[57:13.000 --> 57:17.000]  And almost every state has laws compelling you.
[57:17.000 --> 57:20.000]  If you see somebody beating somebody's brains out for no reason,
[57:20.000 --> 57:26.000]  or you see somebody setting fire to a house, you've got a responsibility to restrain them.
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  And in the continuum of force, if they resist you and continue to try to endanger lives,
[57:30.000 --> 57:34.000]  you have a responsibility to kill them just as the police do.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  I know the common law.
[57:36.000 --> 57:42.000]  And so don't give me that bull that you can't defend yourself or stop crimes in their commission.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  You ever heard of the Good Samaritan Law?
[57:44.000 --> 57:47.000]  You see a car wreck, somebody's bleeding to death, they need help, you drive past.
[57:47.000 --> 57:53.000]  But when people aren't helping them, you are aiding and abetting, and that's manslaughter.
[57:53.000 --> 57:56.000]  All right, now I'm ranting.
[57:56.000 --> 57:59.000]  Makes me sick. People perish for lack of knowledge.
[57:59.000 --> 58:02.000]  We're going to break here, I want to say, about purewaterfreedom.com.
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  They have a whole line of household filters.
[58:04.000 --> 58:07.000]  They're going to be fluoride from other toxins from every water source in your home.
[58:07.000 --> 58:10.000]  They got tabletops under the sink and hell, they got it all.
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  Shower systems.
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  Purewaterfreedom.com.
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  Purewaterfreedom.com.
[58:16.000 --> 58:20.000]  Imagine being able to turn your tap water into safe, clean drinking, bathing water.
[58:20.000 --> 58:22.000]  About a fluoride-free shower.
[58:22.000 --> 58:24.000]  Purewaterfreedom.com.

[58:50.000 --> 58:55.000]  You may be arrested, and or subject to other police action.
[58:55.000 --> 58:56.000]  Tyranny is here.
[58:56.000 --> 59:00.000]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[59:00.000 --> 59:02.000]  It really says that the stake is God.
[59:02.000 --> 59:08.000]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[59:08.000 --> 59:12.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps,
[59:12.000 --> 59:14.000]  now being expanded nationwide.
[59:14.000 --> 59:20.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[59:20.000 --> 59:24.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our Republic has fallen.
[59:24.000 --> 59:29.000]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[59:29.000 --> 59:35.000]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[59:35.000 --> 59:38.000]  It's only the beginning of the Mule and Order's hellish plan.
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  The police state isn't coming.
[59:40.000 --> 59:41.000]  It's here.

[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:25.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  Well, Herman Cain has been caught in a big, fat, gigantic lie.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  That's coming up.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  Australia's in the process of committing suicide.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  That's what James Dillingpole says.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  He's coming up for one segment in the next segment.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  I've got the big breaking news here today on Fast and Furious.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  And now it ties into this fake Iran plot that, of course, involves Mexican drug cartels.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.000]  So, Holder can look like he's finding Mexican drug cartels.
[01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  This is right out of central casting.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  We predicted it.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  Not hard to predict.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  We're going to tear apart the 999 plan, which has got VAT, sales taxes, everything in it.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  I mean, how about Globalist Dream, what do you expect from a fellow reserve operative?
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  The fellow reserve got the income tax in 1913.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  Now they want more.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  They're going to get it because it's so much fun to be conned by Herman Cain, unless we wake up.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  Then they got Tiddlywinks, Tinkerbell, whatever his name is, Romney, running around endorsed by Baron Harkinen,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  Jabba the Hutt or whatever his name is, Chris Plumper.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  And then when he got, I shouldn't joke, I'm a little overweight myself.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  The point is, they're saying, because he's fat people like him, because he doesn't look presidential.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  Herman Cain's black, so he might do, it's what you stand for, not how much you weigh or what color you are.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  I know Ron Paul is in, you know, in good shape, but he's an older guy, kind of like Dudley Dewright.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  But he's Dudley Dewright, ladies and gentlemen, with a brain.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:07.000]  He's not a Ken dollar, a smooth talking Herman Cain or a male cheerleader like Rick Perry.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  I know you like those people, some of you.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  All right, let's go to some of your phone calls out of our next guest.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  Let's talk to Corey in North Carolina.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  You're on the air.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  Welcome.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000]  Hey, Alex.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000]  Thanks for having me on again.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  I wanted to talk about, I don't know if you're taking calls on this right now, but the Occupy Durham Occupy in North Carolina, my experience, and then also recommend someone for you to interview.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  Yeah, I mean, there's no doubt now the entire Democratic Party has endorsed Occupy Wall Street.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  It's got some good people in it, but it is led by collectivists that want to just take money from the rich instead of get rid of the corrupt Federal Reserve.
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  So it's basically a bunch of Bolsheviks if they have their way.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  What's your experience with the Occupy Raleigh up there?
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  Well, I went to the Durham one.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  I don't know the Raleigh one, but in Durham, it was actually run really, really well.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  It was open-ended.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  It was based on consensus.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  They split off into committees.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  And even the organizers, when they split off into the committees, they said, you know, we're not here to push a certain view or any particular angle.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  Yeah, but what did they come up with afterwards?
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  Because if they know predominantly, it's mainly a bunch of union people that show up, then they're going to get their collectivist Obama system that Wall Street wants to make people dependent through.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  Well, they haven't made any specific demands or proposals yet. We're still meeting and organizing.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  I'm just trying to make sure that I'm there and that I am at least a single voice talking about the Federal Reserve and trying to identify the actual problem.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  It seems like a lot of them, you know, realize that there's an issue, but they're having trouble actually pinpointing it.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Well, I'm glad you found some nice folks because all I've run into, well, Houston, they were pretty nice, but they had a lot of in the Fed signs.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:10.000]  What I've mainly run into is don't bring your Ron Paul signs here. We just want to get to rich people.
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  And I'm trying to explain the ultra rich use government to control and to get your tax money and to shut down their competition.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:26.000]  What the general public thinks of as rich is somebody driving a new car and living in a big house. Those are the people that create jobs.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  You know, some middle class person that makes 100,000, 300,000, a million dollars a year, that's what drives the economy more than anything.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  Those consumers, is we're a consumer society. We don't have industry, but interesting. That's interesting to get your story on that.
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  Thank you so much. Aaron, Don, Vincent, and Scott and others, your calls are coming up after I talk to James Dillingpole briefly.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  The one in Telegraph, Telegraph. And then we're going to get into Herman Cain a lot more. Stay with us.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  Those poisonous critters can't live in low moisture food from eFoodsDirect.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:17.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  This man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest small owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:39.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:07:01.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America. The number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America3.com.
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  Alex Jones here with vital information concerning our nation's fragile food supply. Folks, there are some truly dangerous trends forming, and I think it's important for my listeners to do three things right away.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:22.000]  Number 1. Study the past. History really does repeat itself. Number 2. Learn to spot the dangerous food shortage trends.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  Number 3. Take decisive action. A perfect storm is brewing, or a global food crisis. That's why I'm telling everyone to read the new book, Rising Prices Empty Shelves.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  Warning signs that trigger the deadliest famines in history. Don't get caught unprepared when the crisis hits. This book is only available at risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  You'll also get a free copy of Supermarket Survival, how to cut your grocery bills in half. Again, that website is risingpricesemptyshelves.com. That's risingpricesemptyshelves.com.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, US says Iran plotted with Mexican drug cartel to assassinate Saudi ambassador.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  Now, the Attorney General has now been subpoenaed, and he knew yesterday when they put out this new plot that he was about to be subpoenaed.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:07.000]  So now people vaguely paying attention just here that Iran was going to arm Mexico and try to blow up embassies and kill people.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  And so now people just kind of foggily are hearing, oh, Iran was involved.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  So holders fighting drug cartels, not giving them thousands and thousands of weapons and letting them ship cocaine in the US. That's all come out in federal court. They've declared national security months ago in Chicago.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  Bass and Furious is only the very tip of the iceberg that's coming up. Herman Cain caught in lies saying that he never said that we don't need to audit the Fed.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  Proof of those lies coming up. Paul Watson has a big article on it at infowars.com. But I wanted to just for one segment, we appreciate him joining us here on short notice.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  I wanted to get James Dilling poll on because I saw with horror today that the lower house, even though upwards of 90% in the polls I've seen are against us in Australia and different governments have been thrown out in the last few years.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  The implementation of the carbon taxes has already bankrupt many of the sheep farmers, the farmers, but now they're going to jack up the taxes and I've got to break down per household home inspectors.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  You can just type into the search engine under carbon tax, green police to inspect home without warrants. So just just unleashing the Soviets unleashing a new 21st century Bolshevism for the bankers.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  The protest disrupts question time after carbon bill passes the lower house and James Dilling poll writing for the telegraph. He also writes for a lot of other big publications and as a best-selling author says Australia commits suicide.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  Yeah, no one. I mean, this is meant to create a post industrial world. And of course, the big globalist mafia, they're all exempt like General Electric from their own carbon taxes.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:59.000]  They write up here with Ken Lay and Goldman Sachs here in the US show. Going down to James Dilling poll joins us to break this down.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  I agree with you. Australia is committing suicide right now. Even though the public doesn't want it, these are authoritarian. So tell us exactly what's happened.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  You've got Julia Gillard's coalition administration passing by a very slender majority. I think 74 votes, the 72 this tax on Australia, which none of the almost none of the people want except for a few liberals in the cities,
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:43.000]  a tax on carbon, which is going to destroy the Australian economy. And the reason is that of all the world's major economies, none is more dependent on fossil fuels than Australia.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  And the reason for that is Australia is an island of coal, an island of minerals, an island of gas, an island of oil.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  Australia has got lots of fossil fuels. It makes sense for a country like that to use its natural resources. So here is Julia Gillard against the wishes of the Australian people.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  As the world enters the worst depression ever, probably, imposing this tax, which is going to be a tax on everything because everything in Australia is to do with carbon.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  Now, what's interesting about Australia is I think it's a kind of bellwether for the rest of us. You know, it's not just about this swinging tax on carbon.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  You remember the case a few months ago of the Australian farmer who went on hunger strike to protest about the way that his land was not his land.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:49.000]  He'd bought this farmland, but he couldn't clear it of trees because the trees in Australia have been declared a carbon sink, which means that, effectively, private property has been abolished in Australia.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  You can't clear your own land of trees.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  There was another case where a farmer who had cleared his trees around his house as a firebreak was fined by the federal authorities for clearing the trees away from his land.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  And guess what happened? A fire broke out. This guy was the only guy for miles around whose house wasn't burned down because he had sensibly cleared those trees illegally.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  Unbelievable. And I saw two years ago, sheep farmers under the first regiment of this, because they always jack it up, tying himself to a tower for months in a hunger strike because he has to pay a tax on every sheep he has for their flatulence.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  They're saying the methane is evil and they're taking half his land off limits that he paid for that had been in his family for generations.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  This is so incredible. And then it's cold-blooded in that insiders get exemptions from it.
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  So it makes the government and the regional governments like these mafia dons where no one can operate with them.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:59.000]  There was a battle going on for the soul of Australia. Just as there's a battle going on all around the world.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  It's happening in America. It's happening in Britain.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  What's interesting about Australia, I suppose, is that we now have in Australia an opposition party which is absolutely committed to undoing the damage which has been done by this carbon tax.
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  Tony Abbott, the opposition leader, has vowed in blood, he says, that he will repeal this carbon tax as soon as he gets into power.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  And I think given the unpopularity of this carbon tax, he will get into power.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:40.000]  It would be very interesting to see what happens to Australia when it becomes part of the resistance to this global warming craze.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  All this stuff that's being imposed on us by the New World Order of the United Nations and so on.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  If Australia tries to resist this nonsense, as I believe it will, what will the rest of the world economies do?
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  Will they try and punish Australia? If there are still people like Obama running America, for example, if the EPA still has power, what's going to happen to Australia?
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  But I like to think that Australia will prove the leader of the resistance in two years' time.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:18.000]  And that's a good thing. I respect those Australians. I think people power will ultimately decide.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  I mean, I've seen polls over the last few years, scientific ones, between 75 and 90%. It's wildly unpopular.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  I know some previous governments fell because of it, but their mission to bring in this tyranny is so key that they went ahead and rammed it through regardless.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  Now, at least there, they've passed it through their parliament, through their government.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  But here, it doesn't pass Congress, so Obama just does it and then gives his friends waivers from it. And then in your country, David Cameron, for those that don't know, is supporting carbon taxes.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  So it doesn't matter what party you vote for, unless it's, I guess, UKIP.
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  There is a complete democratic deficit in most of the world where this eco-fascism is concerned.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  In Britain, all the three major political parties are committed to decarbonising Britain to impose on these swinging taxes and regulations on us in the name of saving us from a problem that doesn't exist.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  In the US, you have a similar problem in that Obama bypasses the democratic process by using his boot boys in the EPA to circumvent the democratic process.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  So you have no democracy. This stuff is being imposed on you against your will.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:42.000]  And the front runners are all carbon tax lovers, especially Mitt Romney, now endorsed by Chris Christie.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:48.000]  And I tell conservatives, hey, you know who he, Al Gore, thanks him. And he also is the author of Socialist Healthcare.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  And they say, well, we like socialism as long as it's a Republican that looks like a Ken doll.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  And I just say, but I mean, he's also for gun control. And they say, I'm ready to turn him in. I mean, what's wrong with these people?
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:06.000]  I fear that too. I'm looking to, you know, I look to America because things are so dismal here in Europe.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  I look across to America thinking, well, at least something is going to get changed when Obama gets de-frenestrated.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:21.000]  But I look at your lead candidate at the moment for the, you know, to take over. I don't think Romney is the answer. I really don't.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:24.000]  Doesn't he seem like he's a David Cameron clone?
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:33.000]  He does seem like Alex in one. And that is my fear. He is David Cameron Redux. And that is not what you want. America, believe me.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:42.000]  Now, now, why do you think the power elite want this to the point of, you know, the, the front runner they want in America is just like David Cameron?
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:47.000]  He, I mean, he might as well be Al Gore. He just has different rhetoric. Why does the ruling elite?
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  I mean, it's not just a bunch of hippies running around that want to rob rich people. Why does the elite want this?
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:18:01.000]  Because the managerial elite wants somebody who is not going to rock the boat quite simply. They do not want a radical in power.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:09.000]  They do not want a game changer. They do not want somebody who believes in something crazy like restoring the gold standard or anything like that.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:16.000]  They want somebody who can continue as before and hand out the special favors to the special interest groups.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:24.000]  They want another corporatist, you know, a corporatist Republican like, like W was a, well, both Bush Bushes were, were corporatists.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  I agree. Briefly, what's your view on Ron Paul?
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  Ron Paul, I think he comes up with some very sensible stuff on domestic politics. I'm not totally convinced about some of the things.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:42.000]  You know, I did not shed a tear for the assassination of Al Alaki. I'm sorry. I know some of your listeners will disagree with that.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:48.000]  I don't give a toss about that guy being offed. I do, however, agree with him on sound money.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:56.000]  And Alex, I believe that the issue of sound money is going to be the defining issue of our lifetimes.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  I think this is the thing we should do.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  Well, that and the global warming people, but I agree with you from following Australia from afar and getting the phone calls.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.000]  This is the issue that's got them hopping mad to really see the tyranny.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000]  And now I was reading City Morning Herald, they're starting home inspections without warrants and bossy bureaucrats.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000]  The more they squeeze, the more resistance it's going to form.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:22.000]  Of course, James Hillingpole is at JamesHillingpole.com. He writes for The Times, Daily Telegraph and The Spectator.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:28.000]  And his new book is Watermelons, exposing the factor green on the outside, commie on the inside.
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  James, thank you for joining us.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000]  Thanks, Alex. Good to be on show.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  Good to have you on with us. Wow. Yeah, so Australia committing suicide.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:43.000]  They're certainly trying to. The ruling class is, I mean, they're putting in the worst carbon taxes I've ever seen.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  California's doing it. Look at California going to Hades in a handbasket.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.000]  We're going to come back into the economy briefly. Then I'm getting into the big news.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:56.000]  Fast and furious tied into this fake Iran terror plot.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  Stay with us. It's all coming up. I'm Alex Jones, GCNLive.com.

[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:19.000]  And if you're an African-American man, you're at a higher risk of your testosterone turning into estrogen.

[01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:13.080]  All right, look, I know we got loaded phones. I want to go to your calls, okay?
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:19.240]  And I also need when we come back to really spend some time on a couple different issues.
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:25.640]  A, we have Herman Cain caught lying and the problem is there's so many examples of him saying
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:29.960]  no need to audit the Fed. People that want to audit it are dummies. He wrote it in his book.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:34.440]  He tells Ron Paul, it's just not true. And he doesn't appreciate being misrepresented
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:39.960]  and says it convincingly. I mean, this guy makes Bill Clinton look like a bad liar.
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:43.480]  I'm telling you, he's slick because he really looks like he's angry. He's like,
[01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:50.200]  I don't appreciate being misrepresented by you. And Paul's looking and going, okay,
[01:24:50.200 --> 01:24:54.520]  we're going to check because Paul knows full well he's lying. Now, I guarantee you they're
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:25:00.040]  going to have campaign ads if they get the money. And he is the third biggest campaign earner
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:05.080]  and he's going to show Cain lying. That'll be a powerful ad. The Paul campaign doesn't do that
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:11.960]  ad. And I, you know, I recommended none of others did, but the ad about the Al Gore cheerleader
[01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:17.000]  and the rest of it and the Hillary care support. And that pretty much did end old Ricky for now.
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:25.480]  Old Ricky Bobby Perry. All right, I'm digressing. I'm sorry. That's coming up too. Okay, but I can't
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:29.800]  just keep kicking this news down the road. So I'll hit the fast and furious tied into the fake
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:34.120]  terror plot. I'll take calls for the rest of the hour. And then at the start of the next hour,
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:40.280]  I will start getting into the whole Herman Cain thing. Let's do it that way. I want to
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:47.160]  bring Ted Anderson up here. And yes, I'm going to promote and push gold and silver on you because
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:51.720]  I believe in it. I believed in silver when it was $5 an ounce and it's up at 30 something.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:58.200]  It's been almost up to 50. It's the last year shows the volatility. I was promoting gold when
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:04.680]  it was 260 an ounce than 300 and 400 and 500. It's gone way back up in the 1600s. Again,
[01:26:04.680 --> 01:26:08.200]  it's been as high as 2000. You look at the 12 year graph. It's only going up
[01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:12.440]  because of global dollar devaluation. And there's a number to minus resources.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:17.560]  I wanted to bring Ted up because they've basically knocked out most of the speculators
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:23.400]  in gold and silver by raising the margin calls, the margin amounts to record levels to knock
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.040]  out speculation. So now it's the real market we're seeing and it's going back up. So it looks like
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:33.160]  gold's found its bottom and around 1600 and silver has found its bottom and around what 29 or so.
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:38.280]  And it's only going up from here. From what I've seen historically, you may be wrong,
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.880]  but they are devaluing currencies worldwide. Ted Anderson, what say you?
[01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:46.360]  Well, you know what's going on, Alex. Right now, Italy is in trouble. Greece is in trouble.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:51.080]  Germany is turning on the printing press to bail them out. Even places like Switzerland
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:56.440]  is devaluating their currency. The United States obviously is in the same shape.
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:27:02.600]  And you're right about the bottom of the market was right around 1600 on gold.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:09.080]  We've seen 1693 40 already today. We're almost back to $1,700 an ounce. Silver,
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:16.040]  of course, at that $28, $29 level now at 33 18 for a high today. Obviously, the market is not
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:21.320]  thinking that the economy is fixed quite yet. And you know, one of the things, I mean, we have
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:27.720]  that protest that's going on here in Minneapolis down in the Hennepin government center and the
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:31.880]  occupied people. And I was talking to my guys here at the office, we're trying to figure out,
[01:27:31.880 --> 01:27:36.120]  well, what can we do to touch these people? And I thought, you know what I'm going to do?
[01:27:36.120 --> 01:27:41.080]  And if we can get this thing done, we're going to put on an American dream video right there in
[01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:49.560]  a big screen TV and let them watch that genius rent a big field nearby advertising on local radio.
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:54.040]  I know I'm on a couple AMs, AM and FM there in your area. And you've got others,
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:59.560]  Genesis shows that are on like Jason Lewis and who's on locally. And then we can promote that
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:05.320]  and then get all of those well-meaning, a lot of them collectivist Democrat supporters out and say,
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:09.880]  here's what the Federal Reserve is all about. By the way, you're still running that deal,
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:19.800]  even though silver is now way up, you can get two silver dollars at cost $73. I challenge you to

[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:06.680]  to get those 800-686-2237. This is a loss leader. And my loss leader, Ted actually loses money on
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:12.440]  this. Some loss leaders, you just break even. I do some loss leaders that break even. Ted does
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:17.720]  this and loses money on this deal, loses a bunch of money. What is it? At the end of the day,
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:22.440]  I think it's something like 20 bucks Ted's losing here. It's such a great educational tool, Alex.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:26.360]  I mean, like you said, these people don't know their head from their rear end, man. If they watch
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:32.200]  this video, they'll start to get a clue. Okay, yeah, exactly. In fact, get American Dream DVDs
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:36.920]  at infowars.com discounted, or in this deal from Ted, and he'll give it to these people.
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:39.960]  That's the best idea I've ever heard. Stay there, Ted. I want to hear a little bit more about this.
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:46.600]  Folks, call today, 800-686-2237. Yeah, they think capitalism's the problem. They really need to
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:56.760]  see this DVD. 800-686-2337. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:13.880]  relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:19.880]  at home. I have a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling
[01:30:19.880 --> 01:30:26.280]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. For the

[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:42.280]  They're asking for more matches, and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:48.600]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the

[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:06.600]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:11.720]  America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:16.120]  shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:20.920]  family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:26.040]  he's usually right. You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:31.640]  biggest small-owner general growth properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:36.120]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most
[01:32:36.120 --> 01:32:41.320]  important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:45.480]  watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:51.880]  steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.

[01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:20.440]  radio network. Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. We're here back Sunday's 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:25.320]  I'm one of the hardest-working people in radio because the truth and freedom and liberty is worth it.
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:33.560]  We come back 7 o'clock every night, weeknights, Monday through Friday, 7 p.m. Central, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:40.920]  Now, I wanted to finish up with Ted Anderson. That's a great idea, Ted. You sponsored the
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:46.200]  Ron Paul Air Force and gave a lot to the blimp as well with the banner hangs all over the country
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:51.880]  and the aircraft. We ought to get that going again this year for this campaign, this cycle.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:56.760]  But what a great idea to take the American Dream because it's a 35-minute animated,
[01:33:57.400 --> 01:34:02.680]  really historical documentary that's very entertaining in a South Parkian way minus
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:08.680]  the pot of humor and stuff of the Federal Reserve, takeover of America, how it's foreign-owned,
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:13.640]  how it destroys the country. And you're saying you're working on getting one of those big,
[01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:18.760]  I guess, blow-up screens, I guess. A projector or a big screen TV, one of those two.
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:22.200]  They also have high-powered projectors that will shoot it on the sides of buildings.
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:25.560]  We were talking about getting one of those and projecting something like that on the side of
[01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:31.800]  the Fed. Yeah, I mean, that would work out perfectly. The thing about it is that these
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:36.760]  kids are very motivated. They know that there's something wrong, so for that reason, they're
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:44.440]  very smart. My God, the power of that film, because it's short compared to them with Obama
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:49.160]  controllers. They're trying to make them chant into zombies. There'd be no comparison. We're like,
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:53.640]  here's historical information versus zombie chanting. You might be able to actually save
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:57.880]  them from zombie servitude. Yeah, at least some of them, and then they'll start spreading the
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:35:02.600]  words to others. I mean, that's how it works, Alex. I mean, when you got started, when I got
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.720]  started, it was very few people that would listen to this kind of thing. They thought
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:10.600]  we're nuts. And now you put a video like this up. I mean, the creation, the creativity,
[01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:15.720]  they did such a great job in this video, and they'll captivate these kids, you know, they'll
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:20.600]  watch it and they'll go, oh, yeah, now I know who the L.A. is. Absolutely. Folks can buy it in one
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:24.280]  office at info wars.com, the American dream. But the best way to get it is to get Big Brother,
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:29.880]  the Orwellian Nightmare Come True by Mark Dice, free, the free $10 shipping, the free American
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:38.760]  Dream Film DVD, the two silver dollars, $73, 800, 686, 2237, 800, 686, 237. Ted, I need to
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:42.440]  get to this other news. I know you're a busy man, but briefly, you're always promoting the
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:46.120]  silver dollars and silver dollars. It is the best till you're going to find anywhere. Folks,
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:50.360]  do the math, check it out for yourself. What about when they call there's also another big radio
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:55.640]  list of gold and silver specials that are only available to radio listeners? There is. As a
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:59.960]  matter of fact, though, if you even look at the web numbers, they've gone up so much because gold
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:04.360]  has gone up, but you can still pick up the Frank for $363. You'll pay a lot more than that.
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:10.520]  Walking Liberties right now are at $1643. Want to support Ron Paul? Why not get a campaign for
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:15.480]  Liberty Proof Coin for $498? It's a quarter of an ounce of gold. It's a great way to do that,
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:19.320]  and also have gold in your hand. I mean, think about it. If you buy the silver dollars in the
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:23.160]  videos, you're actually going to have silver dollars. Someday in the future, those silver
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:28.760]  dollars could mean the difference between having food and starving. That's how big of a deal that
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:34.200]  is. Plus, they're the real silver dollars, the silver dollars that Thomas Jefferson and company
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:40.760]  designed in the Constitution for us to have his money. This is real historical value. It's not
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:47.160]  some slug that some off-brand mint had made. It's the real deal. Ted, in closing, the good news here
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:53.880]  is that in the past, when gold and silver dipped momentarily in the last 12 years,
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:58.280]  you'd be dead as a doornail up there. You told me the last few weeks in this artificial dip,
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:02.760]  you've seen record purchasing of gold and silver going on, and that really shows
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:09.720]  that people are waking up and are used to these manipulative cycles now, and that they try to
[01:37:09.720 --> 01:37:14.600]  manipulate the speculative market, but in the physical, people are really starting to wake up
[01:37:14.600 --> 01:37:18.360]  to what's going on. And so people can now still get gold and silver you bought weeks ago
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:22.600]  at the lower price, even though it's gone up a lot. That's what they get when they call and ask
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:30.280]  about the list of radio specials 800-686-2237. Final comments, Ted. Yeah, just don't pay
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:35.160]  attention to what's going on with all this manipulation. The reality is that the world
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:40.120]  is falling apart right now. There's way too much debt, and the problems aren't solved yet,
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:44.440]  and you're going to see gold and silver increase in value as the dollar depletes,
[01:37:44.440 --> 01:37:48.520]  because the government is still turning to the printing press to solve these problems,
[01:37:48.520 --> 01:37:55.720]  and that's just the way it is. And you'll see it rise. I just know that that's what we're in for.
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:01.400]  Rising prices in gold and silver, or in reality, the value of the currency is going to fall.
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:07.640]  Well said, Ted. Thank you so much. That was Ted Anderson joining us. Okay, here's what I want to
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:12.840]  do. I really want to take calls, but I can't sit here and mention this news and not get to it.
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:17.320]  So I'm going to go to Aaron, Don, Vincent, David, Ronnie here in just a few minutes,
[01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:21.560]  and then I'll continue with calls into the next hour. But the next hour, I'll first get into
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:29.480]  Fed Insider Kane caught in brazen debate lie. Ron Paul also goes after him and says,
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:33.240]  oh, you can't mention who you to point as the new Fed Ed, but you were president,
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:39.240]  and he went on and said, spoke like a true insider. So I'm going to get to that next hour.
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:46.760]  First, I'm going to get to this group of articles here that I have in my hot little hands.
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:54.360]  This is from info wars.com us. I ran plotted with Mexican drug cartel to assassinate
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:39:00.040]  Shawty ambassador. Now I told you that with fast and furious
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:08.520]  coming to a head that you would look for a stage terror attack or a foiled attack.
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:14.440]  That's a no brainer. But I couldn't even imagine that it would be Mexican associated,
[01:39:14.440 --> 01:39:20.360]  but they want to blur that. So in the made up story, the Mexican drug cartels, the ones
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:24.520]  that older has been arming for three years, at least.
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:30.120]  And now it's coming out in the news. I'll get to that that Hillary, of course, is in charge of this.
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:33.480]  False flag against the Second Amendment is only one part of it.
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:39.160]  That they would say Mexican drug cartels were involved, but then go on and say there's actually
[01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:43.480]  no proof. It's like we have a major terror threat. Checkpoints nationwide. No warrants.
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:47.160]  It's a constitution free day because Al Qaeda wants to get us. But by the way,
[01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:51.880]  there's no real credible threat from this. And then Governor Ridge, of course,
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:55.240]  admitted back two years ago that when he was head of Homeland Security,
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:40:01.000]  Bush would tell him to issue fake terror alerts as a political protection.
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:06.280]  Because every time something negative came out, well, uh-oh, death con five, you know,
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:11.720]  the terrorists are going to get us. Oh my gosh, we're in so much trouble.
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:18.280]  So here is the headline. U.S. Iran plotted with Mexican drug cartel to assassinate
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:23.160]  Saudi ambassador. The United States has accused Iran of plotting to kill
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:27.720]  the Saudi ambassador to the United States and bomb the Saudi embassy in Washington.
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:35.160]  So right as Israel says they want to attack Iran and right as the drum beating gets the
[01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:39.800]  heaviest it's ever been. We had Ray McGovern on former CIA to talk about that last week.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:47.080]  Magicly, Iran's working with the drug cartels and there's the good attorney general fighting Iran,
[01:40:47.080 --> 01:40:51.960]  along with the Mexican cartels, while he's not involved arming them, while he's fighting them.
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:54.680]  Isn't that just special?
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:02.680]  According to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, who it's come out in federal court,
[01:41:02.680 --> 01:41:06.520]  allows Sena Loa to ship cocaine in and gives them the guns to knock out their competition.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:10.360]  That they declare national security on that and they're not denying it.
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:13.960]  I mean, so what? They deal some drugs, they bring some guns out of the country,
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:17.560]  they give guns to people in Tampa and Chicago and Indianapolis,
[01:41:17.560 --> 01:41:21.720]  but they're a good government. These are good people. Let them search your car to checkpoint
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:27.960]  for drugs. Makes a lot of sense. The Justice Department claims Iran and Mexican drug cartels
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:33.160]  work together on the plot. Holder and the Justice Department claim the plot was hatched in Mexico
[01:41:33.160 --> 01:41:44.520]  last May. Two Iranians, Mansour Rabasier and Jolome Chakri were accused of the attack in
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:51.480]  court documents, according to the New York Times. And it goes on. The Justice Department
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:58.600]  claims Iran and Mexican drug cartels work together on the plot. Holder said there is no basis to
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:04.760]  believe that any other conspirators are present in the U.S. Oh, these are people outside. I'm sure
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:09.000]  a drone will kill them. They'll really just bomb a chicken shack or something and say they killed
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:13.880]  them. You know, they kill the locky five, six times. I mean, why not? There's no basis in.
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:18.520]  They're not here. I just said he saved you though. He said the two men are connected to
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:31.000]  Quds Force, a division of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Yeah, yeah. Right as Israel started
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:37.080]  to blow up Iran, they would do this. Sure. And Easter bunnies lay eggs on Easter. Holder said
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:42.200]  the money to support the attack had been transferred through a New York bank, but the men had not
[01:42:42.200 --> 01:42:47.080]  yet obtained any explosives. In addition to holding these individual conspirators accountable for
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:51.560]  their alleged role. This is his quote for their alleged role in the plot. The United States is
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:42:57.240]  committed to holding Iran accountable for its actions. Holder said, yes, Mr Lyre has been caught
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:03.880]  perjuring himself in Oklahoma City and the Mark Rich pardons in Fast and Furious. Right as you get
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:10.120]  subpoenaed to block all this out, you're protecting us from the drug cartels that work with the evil
[01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:17.560]  Islamists. Yes, sure you are. The Justice Department made the criminal complaint public ahead of a
[01:43:17.560 --> 01:43:21.400]  fresh round of sanctions by the US Treasury Department against the Islamic Revolutionary
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:25.720]  Guard Corps, which is already sanctioned for its role in overseeing Iran's nuclear program.
[01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:31.400]  The US and Israel accused Iran of secretly using its nuclear energy program to build nuclear weapons.
[01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:35.000]  The Islamic Republic of Iran has rejected the accusation and characterized it as a
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:41.720]  prefabricated scenario. I don't know. The people who run our country have only overthrown Iran twice
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:54.600]  and staged terror attacks to do it. Now, let's get into exactly why this is now being brought up.
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:03.720]  This is now being brought up because right on time, ISSA issues subpoena to holder
[01:44:03.720 --> 01:44:11.720]  in Fast and Furious investigation. And we just so happened to have the subpoena. I'll copy of it
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:19.560]  here. Got it linked up at info wars.com. We'd like to go read it for yourself. And they subpoenaed
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:24.920]  the Attorney General, the Deputy Foreign Attorney General, the Office of the Attorney General,
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:30.600]  Acting Deputy Attorney Council, Assistant Attorney General of just a whole bunch of these people.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:36.040]  It looks about like 10 of them, 12 of them. And then you get over here,
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:45.320]  James trustee, the organized crime and gang section, all these other people, the criminal fraud
[01:44:45.320 --> 01:44:49.880]  section. And they want all the communications between all these different organizations and
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:56.120]  groups. But if you're already a lying criminal, you know, that's another thing about about being
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:00.360]  the head of the Federal Reserve, like Herman Cain was, the Federal Reserve has been caught all
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:04.600]  over the country laundering drug money knowingly over and over again, just to a Google or Lexus
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:13.160]  Nexus on that. Again, these are dirty people just because Holder and and and and and Obama
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:18.600]  and and and Cain and Hillary and all these people wear little fancy suits that she wears a big
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:24.280]  brooch and all this. This is organized crime that runs our country. That's what tyranny is.
[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:30.440]  And it's business as usual. These are just organized crime puppets, though.
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:38.280]  And it continues with all the different things that they're demanding. And then the Suffolk
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:45.800]  County report has a report here with Mike Vanderbog, sources close to the development
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:50.600]  of the gun walker scheme, state that, and this is what I've gotten out of congressional testimony,
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:54.280]  similar things. This goes all the way up into the White House at the highest levels. And that's
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:58.280]  been confirmed that they all knew and they've been caught in emails lying and didn't know. So
[01:45:58.280 --> 01:46:06.440]  Hillary and her trusted associate, Secretary of State, reportedly Andrew J. Shapiro devised at
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:11.080]  least part of the framework for what later become Operation Fast and Furious. It was Shapiro,
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:15.720]  reportedly, who first described the details of the proposed scheme early in 09,
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:21.320]  just after the Obama administration took office. Vanderbog relates the following. His sources
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:26.520]  say Hillary's trusted subordinate. It's come out that this is high-level people in the White
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:31.480]  House, cabinet level. They haven't said exactly who, though, in congressional testimony. It was
[01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:37.480]  Shapiro who first described to the Secretary of State the details of the plan. And, of course,
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:42.440]  this is so public that they've even given speeches before. Turns out two years ago,
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:47.400]  bragging about Fast and Furious and their gun walking program. And now they were going to use
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:54.680]  that to crack down on semiautomatics and the rest of it. And now we have, on the heels of all of this,
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:47:06.200]  we now have the ATF saying, cancel more than two rifles if you do. Call us. We may do a criminal
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:10.200]  investigation. They already know that the NIC system, you're buying three shotguns, two handguns,
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:17.000]  whatever it is. They already know. It's already called in. The FBI put the database. So in three
[01:47:17.000 --> 01:47:20.840]  or four months ago, they did that and sent those letters out outside of law. They tried to pass the
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:24.280]  law earlier this year. They couldn't. So they just said, we don't need any stinking law.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:32.760]  You know, just like with EPA greenhouse gas stuff, we'll just do it. And so they're now doing it.
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:36.840]  And now they're saying, you've got to find out as a gun shop dealer, as a federal firearms
[01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:41.400]  licensee, if somebody's got a medical marijuana card. And there are literally hundreds of different
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:46.920]  ailments that marijuana has been proven to help. Stomach aches, nausea, glaucoma, list goes on and on.
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:53.080]  People that can't eat, don't have an appetite, depression, you name it. I'm not even saying
[01:47:53.080 --> 01:47:57.080]  marijuana is good. You know, some people that has a bad effect, some people that has a good effect.
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:48:05.480]  It's a drug, very complex natural drug. But I'll put to you this way. Today's marijuana
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:09.640]  hidden grandpa, George Washington's marijuana. It's a lot stronger. It's been bred that way.
[01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:15.560]  But the issue here is the reason I digress is they're saying, if you've got a medical marijuana
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:21.560]  card under law through your medical doctor, that even if you don't ask and find out,
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:25.160]  they're going to swap team raid and put you in jail. And they're going to swap team raid people
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:32.360]  with medical marijuana cards now and confiscate their guns. I mean, this is a lawless brazen
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:39.560]  group of brutish criminals, violating state's rights and the rights of doctors who are the
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:48.920]  experts to prescribe marijuana. I've seen a bunch of big studies where Prozac and Prozac
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:54.120]  type drugs actually increased suicide depression. And they did double blind studies with THC pills.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:57.320]  And that actually helped depression on average.
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:03.240]  But again, I'm not going to sit here and get into the pros and cons of marijuana.
[01:49:05.960 --> 01:49:10.280]  I've said so that I can be up on the subject and accurately cover it about once a year.
[01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:20.280]  I will try some out and it is a serious drug. And I don't recommend young people use it. And I
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:24.680]  don't think it's cool to turn a lot of folks into deadbeats, but it does have medical uses.
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:32.680]  And it's up to the states to basically deal with this and the feds are out of control.
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:42.360]  But I now digress my friends off into other areas. I want to go to break and come back
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:48.760]  until 20 after next hour. And I will take phone calls, 30 minutes or so of phone calls when we
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:53.160]  come back from break. And then I'm going to get into really the finale of the transmission.
[01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:58.120]  I've got some military news. I've got some economy news I want to get to.
[01:49:58.680 --> 01:50:03.080]  Families are facing the biggest fall and income since the 1970s all by design.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:06.920]  I've got an Occupy LA speaker calls for violence. This violence will be needed.
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:13.240]  Wow, we had the survivor, the underwear bomber on. The only witness he was going to call.
[01:50:14.120 --> 01:50:18.760]  Haskell did predict actually on air that it was probably a way to get a plea bargain because
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:22.680]  they didn't want to ask for testifying. That happened today. He's now announced he's going
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:26.360]  to sue the government. The fact that they almost killed him helping the underwear bomber get on
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:32.280]  the plane. That's going to be an amazing civil suit. That's all coming up. That broke here.
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:37.320]  Dillingpole on the carbon taxes in Australia is Australia commits suicide. That's his headline.
[01:50:40.040 --> 01:50:45.160]  But coming up, Fed Insider Kane caught in brazen debate lie. We're going to play the clips,
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:50.120]  prove the lies, all of it coming up 20 minutes in the next hour. But first,

[01:54:25.320 --> 01:54:50.760]  I tell you, I can get so much more done around here if I wasn't always dealing with taxes and
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:57.160]  bills and scrambling around trying to feed the coal into this locomotive. But we've done a lot
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:55:02.760]  together. It's amazing. So I appreciate all your financial support at infowars.com. Okay,
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:08.120]  that's why I was late getting in there banging on the door. Get in here. Let's go ahead and go to
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:14.200]  your phone calls. Let's go to Aaron in Wisconsin. Welcome. You're on the air. Hey, what's up, buddy?
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:18.840]  Hey, Alex, what's going on with you? Worldwide transmission, my friend. How may I serve you?
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:25.400]  Well, I understand the worldwide transmission. You might have to spend a few minutes here.
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:32.280]  But first, you know, you're really, you are Johnny B. Good, you know what I'm saying? You're
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:37.960]  showing everyone the example for one. And I know you digress, you know what I'm saying?
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:44.440]  And but it's almost like I'm sitting here trying to respond. And you know, you bring up a lot of
[01:55:44.440 --> 01:55:51.480]  topics. I jump around. I don't just sit here and go, Aha, look at Obama or look at Bush. I'm
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:55.160]  pointing out they're just puppets, which is elementary. But for a lot of the public, that's
[01:55:55.160 --> 01:56:00.200]  a new idea. What do you think of all this news? What you calling about today? Because we've got
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:05.880]  we've got so much going on. And that's the thing. I'll get to the point where I came to call in,
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:11.960]  but I'll also respond to things you went with with Ted Anderson. I mean, just imagine back
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:17.880]  you could buy comic books for a dime. And the reason why is made of silver. You could hand
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:24.440]  them an object and receive an object. Nowadays, you have to hand them thousands of digital objects
[01:56:24.440 --> 01:56:30.760]  to get something. When my mom was a child, she could go to the drug store with 50 cents and get
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:38.920]  a Coca Cola, get some cup of candy and get a grilled cheese for 50 cents. Now you can't get
[01:56:38.920 --> 01:56:45.640]  a cup of coffee for 50 cents. It's all about the valuation of the currency. That's right.
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:51.720]  And so, so Ted brought up a good point with Herman King. He's going to destroy himself,
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:58.680]  obviously, for the Federal Reserve. But part of the movement that we really need to focus on
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:06.520]  is a term, the new world order. And we have signs at these occupies saying, stop the new world order.
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:11.560]  People go online more than they could with the Fed. Because who knows, you know, the Fed could put
[01:57:11.560 --> 01:57:17.560]  up their own website. They could look at their own Fed website. I don't disagree that Fed should
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:23.560]  not be part of the thing. But the new world order is our problem. And that's what we need to say.
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:27.880]  No, I know. But I mean, the Federal Reserve is how the big megabanks get their government power.
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:32.280]  It is private, but it's got to deal with the government and it's been given government power.
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:37.800]  And so that's how you strip them of their power to monetize debt and devalue the currency.
[01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:43.000]  I appreciate your call. Good to hear from you. Don in Tennessee, welcome. Thank you for holding.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:53.240]  This tactic sound like the Celtic Highland clearances in Scotland and Ireland. No, using the resources
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:59.320]  on the land, no cutting wood, no burning wood, forbidding the Celtic colors and symbols.
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:08.280]  I would like to have maybe some of your British friends talk about that of some time.
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:12.760]  Well, no, you're absolutely right. I've pointed this out. Stay there. I'll come back to you in
[01:58:12.760 --> 01:58:17.560]  a minute. I don't want to shortchange you. For those that don't know history, in ancient Japan,
[01:58:18.200 --> 01:58:26.040]  in ancient England, ancient France, the ancient aspects, the slave class couldn't cut wood, couldn't
[01:58:26.040 --> 01:58:31.800]  use resources. That's how the system controls you. And the Club of Rome admits this post-industrial
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:38.360]  global system, this new world order, is neo feudalism. It is serfdom. That's what it is.

[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:55.400]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:59.720]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:04.760]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:10.280]  to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:15.480]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:20.200]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:24.760]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:29.080]  their power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[01:59:29.080 --> 01:59:33.160]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[01:59:33.160 --> 01:59:37.880]  generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information

[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:59.000]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:12.920]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:21.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.000 --> 02:00:28.600]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number three, and we are taking your phone calls.
[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:33.800]  I had a breakdown of the deception of Herman Cain and the Private Fellow Reserve and more.
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:38.920]  About eight stacks of news I haven't gotten to yet, though I'm pretty proud. We've actually done
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:44.680]  a better job than usual. We've covered a ton of important information so far. Don in Tennessee
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:49.800]  said, hey, these carbon taxes, these shutdowns of people's land, not letting them use their own
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:55.320]  property, not letting them cut trees. This sounds like the different feudal rules they had on the
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:01.560]  people of Scotland. Well, feudalism is the same in every culture, yes. But sir,
[02:01:01.560 --> 02:01:09.080]  you're not just seeing a similarity. The UN, the Club of Rome, Al Gore, Jacques Cousteau before
[02:01:09.080 --> 02:01:14.920]  he died, Prince Philip, Prince Charles' dad, Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth II,
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:21.800]  Maury Strong, all these people, they say that's what they're setting up. And then, of course,
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:27.800]  they're all exempt from it. Here in Austin, I've got a report where there's one pecan tree
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:32.200]  where they wanted to build a giant high-rise building, which the city stole a bunch of property
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:36.840]  around Austin and said, build only dense stuff, so that's one rule. But this wasn't an insider
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:45.800]  company, so the committee said, well, this pecan, you can't cut it, so you can't build a high-rise
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:53.160]  condo. And it's all about power. Now, the globalists want to bomb all over the world and blow up
[02:01:53.160 --> 02:01:58.040]  trees. That's fine. But again, it's about selectively as lords dominating people.
[02:01:59.320 --> 02:02:04.440]  Go ahead and finish your points on that, sir. Yes, sir. I'm about to finish. I guess the climax
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:09.800]  was the British Redcoats' soldiers killing women and children in the Highlands. I mean,
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:17.480]  just shooting whole valleys full of people. And they're doing it that now in Africa and the foreign
[02:02:17.480 --> 02:02:24.840]  other foreign countries. But thank you. Well, thank you, sir. I appreciate your call. I mean,
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:31.800]  look, every culture that's dominant throughout history goes and murders everybody. Nowadays,
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:35.400]  you know, one African tribe is more powerful than the other. They go slaughter them.
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:39.960]  One Mesoamerican tribe is more powerful than the other. They go slaughter them. And those
[02:02:39.960 --> 02:02:45.480]  that keep alive to do the slave work, you know, you don't cut a tree, you don't kill anything,
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:53.000]  you starve to death. That's why the old saying is you could tell in Europe, the nobles would be
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:58.600]  like a foot taller, healthier than the general public because of people, you know, generation
[02:02:58.600 --> 02:03:02.840]  of generation at subsistence level. And the little kids are staying around with their ribs all
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:08.280]  sticking out and the lords all ride by all healthy. That was part of their domination.
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:13.400]  They wrote handbooks on it. Keep them starving to death. Keep them subsistence. So of course,
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:18.840]  the royalty with the Rothschilds and others, that's what environmentalism is. It's not just
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:23.720]  keeping you skinny and starving. Their carbon taxes will kill about a billion people. They
[02:03:23.720 --> 02:03:28.440]  admit and they're very proud of it. Your average liberal Nazi trendy will tell you,
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:33.240]  yeah, we got to kill people. Yeah, that's good. But see, they want your house, your money,
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:39.480]  your taxes, they're going to live large. They're not really liberals. They know exactly what they're
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:45.960]  doing. Just like these mainline conservatives know exactly what they're doing. Gun control,
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:51.720]  Mitt Romney's for it. Conservatives are like, Limbaugh says it's cool. I'm for it. Yeah,
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:56.920]  take my guns immediately. Alex, shut up liberal. I'm like, I'm against giving my guns up. Shut
[02:03:56.920 --> 02:04:01.880]  up, Communist. Turning your guns in his freedom. I mean, it's just like total mental illness.
[02:04:02.440 --> 02:04:07.400]  Hey, they're for carbon taxes. Well, good. I'm for it. Wrote the government health care plan.
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:14.200]  Average conservative goes, Hey, I vote for Romney Fox News says I'm a winner. I want to feel good.
[02:04:14.200 --> 02:04:20.280]  I'm against guns. I'm for carbon taxes. I like Obamacare. But I hate Obama because he wants
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:30.920]  my guns and is for Obamacare. But wait, Mitt Romney's for it. But that's different. It's double
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:36.280]  think feeling like they're winners, just like your average idiot collectivist. I mean, they just
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:44.280]  don't know their morons. They repeat what they hear on TV and makes them feel smart. It's all
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:50.840]  boiled down at a third grade level for them. And they like it. And they want to get hurt bad.
[02:04:51.960 --> 02:04:56.840]  They serve weakness. They have a religion of being suckers.

[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:38.360]  I'm tired of you misrepresenting me and saying I don't want an audit. I want an audit.
[02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:44.760]  And I didn't call people stupid that wanted one. Ron Paul's like, oh really? I'll get the quote then.
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:50.600]  Paul Watson has a link to it on infowars.com. He wrote and said people that want an audit
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:59.320]  are stupid. That's a quote. He also said it on Neil Bortz's show that an audit isn't needed.
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:07.640]  I mean, and do, has found other quotes. So it just shows the deception. We've also got Ron Paul
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:14.120]  talking about how Herman Cain's answer on the subject about who would he appoint as a Federal
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:21.320]  Reserve Head was. What did he say? Quote. What an insider would say. So that's all coming up.
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:26.120]  Let's go to Vincent in Nebraska. Vincent, thank you for calling.
[02:09:27.800 --> 02:09:31.960]  Hello, Alex. I just want to make three points. I'll try to be real quick. The first point I want
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:39.240]  to make is that this coming Saturday, October 15th, anybody that's listening in the Midwest,
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:44.520]  Occupy Omaha is meeting up at 9 o'clock in the morning at the Omaha City Hall and then marching
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:51.560]  to the Federal Reserve Building in Omaha. The second point I want to make is that for any of
[02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:55.720]  our listeners, any of the Ron Paul people who are listening to this and who are getting involved
[02:09:55.720 --> 02:10:01.000]  in Occupy Omaha are reaching out to them. I suggest it would be and we're doing up here
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:08.280]  is we're setting up days where we have seminars or education events to educate these people on
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:12.360]  how the Federal Reserve works and how the system works and how central banking works.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:19.160]  And if you as a person is not that well versed on the issue, then I would suggest that you have
[02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:24.600]  set up a day where you have a movie screening of the video freeing the fascism or the one I like
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:31.480]  is Money Banking in the Federal Reserve by the Von Mies Institute. And then the third point
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:36.360]  I want to make, I just want to say that I'm one of those stupid people that Herman came to book
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:41.640]  because about nine months ago when he was in Council Bluffs in Iowa up here touring,
[02:10:42.760 --> 02:10:46.440]  I questioned him on the Federal Reserve and he responded by saying I'm not a conspiracy
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:52.120]  theorist. And then and then out today he just talked about how all who want to want an audit
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:57.720]  are crazy. Yeah well that's the 1980s and 90s response. The talking point by talk show host
[02:10:57.720 --> 02:11:03.560]  was it doesn't exist. I remember being called into the program director's office when the real radio
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:08.120]  guy went and took a better job, the real program director, and they had a guy whose job before
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:12.680]  that had been as a mascot in a B-suit he knew nothing about it. And he said listen you're
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:16.920]  putting out this dis info that the Federal Reserve isn't a government institution. It is and you're
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:21.480]  going to stop that. And I said well let me show you proof. He said I don't want to see it. You need
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:27.480]  to get off these conspiracy theories and you've been warned because he heard other hosts, national
[02:11:27.480 --> 02:11:34.920]  ones saying it was government. And it's such a hoax that they live under. So Herman Cain said to you
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:39.560]  I don't get into conspiracies even mentioning the Federal Reserve. Again I remember back if you
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:46.680]  mentioned the CFR, Limbaugh would say it didn't exist 20 years ago. Again that's how long they've
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:54.680]  kept conservatives in the dark. That's these neocons job is to just sit on top people and make
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:58.280]  sure that they never find out the truth. Anything else sir?
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:05.240]  Well I just also want to add that after that incident he also toured Iowa and I was not the
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:09.640]  only one who questioned him on the Federal Reserve issue. And after his two-week tour,
[02:12:09.640 --> 02:12:15.240]  after being cornered by all these activists all over the state of Iowa, then he came out with
[02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:20.200]  the video on YouTube talking about how he supports the Fed and supports Congressman Paul's audit of
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:25.640]  the Fed. So because of us cornering him all over the state of Iowa he switched his... No, no you're
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:32.120]  right. He's gone from six months ago saying you're a coot, you're a liar, you're a nut. To talk about
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:36.840]  about it's a conspiracy theory. I mean now having an opinion monetarily is a conspiracy theory.
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:40.680]  That's like you don't like being groped by the TSA, you're a conspiracy theorist. Now it's not even
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:46.440]  that they're debating information. Now having a view like I like chocolate ice cream instead of
[02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:52.200]  strawberry, that's a conspiracy theory. I mean literally it's mind control and yes he's changed
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:59.400]  his tune and said well of course I'm for an audit. I've never said I wasn't. This is outrageous that
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:04.760]  you would say such a thing. And he says it with a straight face which again shows you what a liar
[02:13:04.760 --> 02:13:11.560]  he is. I saw one commenter on info wars.com in the article today saying Herman Cain lies just as easy
[02:13:11.560 --> 02:13:17.320]  as he tightens his tie. I mean it's just automatic, corporate. People are like we need somebody with
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:22.520]  business experience. The big corporations whatever maybe you think corporations can't be good, bad
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:29.720]  or ugly or indifferent. The big mega corporations like Pillsbury that he worked for go in and buy
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:36.200]  off politicians. That's their business. There's many corporations are bigger than most governments
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:43.160]  now. There's this idea that they're perfect or their corporate welfare is good. All right now
[02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:49.400]  I'm ranting. David in Oklahoma, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. Well good afternoon you uh
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:55.880]  you you Bolshevik you. Exactly I won't turn my guns in. I'm a Bolshevik now. That's right yeah
[02:13:55.880 --> 02:13:59.800]  check it out. All right check this out. I see the um I want to talk about the uh
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:07.320]  um false black deal down in Mexico and uh it's actually it's going to serve two purposes. Number
[02:14:07.320 --> 02:14:13.080]  one is going to legitimize fast and furious because now they can say uh well see if we didn't have
[02:14:13.080 --> 02:14:19.800]  fast and furious going on we would have never found out about this. Secondly is that oh well
[02:14:19.800 --> 02:14:25.800]  you know you've got a guy on the republican side saying that uh Iran should have nooks now if since
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:32.840]  we found out this thing about Iran is that state sponsored terror is going on here then this guy
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:38.680]  here he's completely illegitimate now because he wants Iran to have nooks for their um you know for
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:45.640]  their uh uh power consumption and such. Sir I'm going to stop you. This guy's a genius. That is
[02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:52.920]  exactly David what I meant to get to when they come out while fast and furious subpoenas go out
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:15:00.120]  the day of it and say Iran wanted to blow up an embassy in DC but we don't have any proof and the
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:06.440]  guys have left the country and they are actually saying this is why our surveillance of the Mexican
[02:15:06.440 --> 02:15:11.960]  cartels is so important and I bet you're right they're going to start going after Ron Paul for
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:17.320]  saying stay out of the Middle East and Central Asia's business. You are absolutely correct I mean
[02:15:17.320 --> 02:15:23.720]  how obvious does this have to get Ronnie or not Ronnie uh David. Yeah well you know it's one
[02:15:23.720 --> 02:15:30.120]  of those kind of things that you know when you've been awakened then you can you you you now know
[02:15:30.120 --> 02:15:37.240]  that there's something beyond the surface you know and um I mean there's it's it's clear I mean
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:41.160]  anything next thing you do they're going to kill bin Laden again I'm telling you it's coming they're
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:49.080]  going to kill bin Laden again it's coming they say they killed a lockie five times they're going to
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:54.520]  kill him again too and you know what as an on-court you're going to bring back Saddam Hussein watch
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:16:01.320]  what I said man you're good watch what I tell you but yeah that's all you know I don't get a
[02:16:01.320 --> 02:16:07.720]  chance to call you that much anymore uh because I'm on back on the road now but um you know this
[02:16:07.720 --> 02:16:13.160]  this thing here it's just crazy and and I've got family that live in Chicago I'm from Chicago
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:17.960]  originally and I got family that live in Chicago and they literally worship the ground Obama walks
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:24.200]  on I got one cousin that's kind of halfway getting away and uh and she's in the banking world and um
[02:16:24.200 --> 02:16:29.560]  she is on the retail side and the next time I get to talk to her I'm going to share the insight
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:35.320]  that you had about how uh the big banks they don't want our retail business anymore and she's going
[02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:41.240]  to hit the fan she just got this new six-figure job and she's probably happy right now but it's
[02:16:41.240 --> 02:16:45.720]  going to be short-lived well that's a great point I mean they've already laid off 50 something
[02:16:45.720 --> 02:16:49.480]  thousand this year at Bank of America they're announcing they plan to cut way back on the
[02:16:49.480 --> 02:16:54.520]  retail banking sector uh and uh that's something that'll really get people's attention I appreciate
[02:16:54.520 --> 02:17:00.840]  your call anything else you want to add David not out of doing man keep it up God bless you
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:07.960]  yeah I mean the day the subpoenas go out yesterday they come out and announce to cover it up we
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:13.240]  stopped Iran we were tracking the Mexican cartels see fast and furious was good Iran was going to
[02:17:13.240 --> 02:17:20.600]  blow up the embassy and they know conservatives hate Iran so much and love getting scared of them
[02:17:21.640 --> 02:17:27.560]  so much and and and and and have a fetish to like crawl on the ground and hide under their bed
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:32.760]  and shake and fear at night over it that they're like I like hold her now he's calling al-qaeda
[02:17:33.880 --> 02:17:39.160]  and we're like but they gave it libya to al-qaeda doesn't matter they fought him by handing it over
[02:17:39.160 --> 02:17:45.480]  to him and I like carbon taxes and I like gun control I like Mitt Romney I like the fact that he
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:49.720]  wrote the health care bill for Obama get out of here you both of it and I'm like I'm against social
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:57.800]  health care shut up commie linen is conservative George Washington is commie get out of here I like it
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:06.200]  sorry that's how they operate now I mean that's and the guy's right I mean they claim they killed
[02:18:06.200 --> 02:18:12.040]  chemical Ali three four times I've seen some of these terrorists they've killed more than a dozen
[02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:17.960]  times I went and did the math it's five times they said they were sure they killed and we're all
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:23.800]  a locking and they never retract the last time they killed him and you're probably right they
[02:18:23.800 --> 02:18:28.120]  probably will kill bin Laden again don't give them ideas they'll kill them every week maybe they'll
[02:18:28.120 --> 02:18:33.160]  have a pinata on national TV every Sunday and Obama will go out and beat up the pinata of
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:39.240]  bin Laden and there he is he'll be ritually killed over and over again reason I called the last
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:47.080]  caller Ronnie is because Ronnie is up next in Texas Ronnie in Texas welcome thank you sir
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:51.400]  yes that's we proceed thank you and here I am in in Austin and yesterday there were three things I
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:56.920]  want to mention one one I witnessed most of not all protesters outside of city hall were praising
[02:18:57.400 --> 02:19:02.760]  my Ron Paul sign as I dutifully stood across the street because I'm still supposedly banned
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:07.640]  threatened with a warrant for criminal trespassing if I dare to set foot on the city hall because our
[02:19:07.640 --> 02:19:12.360]  delusional laughing stock of a man that is on the news you're not allowed to be at city hall and
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:18.040]  citizens communication for saying your name is Ronnie reforeseen uh and uh then now they're
[02:19:18.040 --> 02:19:22.680]  banning other free speech they are our supreme rulers that's right John Bush was also banned for
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:29.320]  a year and but and and from the help of my good friend Clay Defoe Mr. Mayor lepping well now knows
[02:19:29.320 --> 02:19:34.760]  that me John Bush and others are not just standing idly by while our rights are being shredded before
[02:19:34.760 --> 02:19:39.640]  I by the whim of this laughing stock of a man that we have but that two things I wanted to also
[02:19:39.640 --> 02:19:46.280]  mention was about the debate last night was in lockstep amnesia those pundits they just excluded
[02:19:46.280 --> 02:19:52.840]  as usual OBGYN Dr. Ron Paul focusing fiercely on Mitt Romney care and Governor Gardisville
[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:58.200]  and they even gave Mr. Nobody new gangers the floor many many times and now they always give
[02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:03.720]  Ron Paul the least amount of time because he's the only real guy our rights as individuals to
[02:20:03.720 --> 02:20:08.600]  freely purchase dietary supplements over the counter are under constant attack the globalists

[02:26:27.240 --> 02:26:35.080]  i'm guessing you but but just here like within well actually ma'am ma'am ma'am in game is actually
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:43.560]  not true um because it it's much worse you know frankly i look at my older films and now i know
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:51.720]  so much more that uh they're almost like white washes so so yes in game is true and then some
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:57.960]  but but but to a point of is skim milk really milk i mean it's and maybe it's good that it's not
[02:26:57.960 --> 02:27:03.720]  it seems super hardcore very frightening very hard and horrifying very evil if what i say in the
[02:27:03.720 --> 02:27:12.280]  film is true and it is and and then some like a million light years some uh i mean faster than light
[02:27:13.560 --> 02:27:21.320]  you know movie serious but again it's like skim milk compared to cream uh or churned butter
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:26.600]  i mean it's so much more real than i even say but you were saying you were wondering if it was real
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:35.320]  and then what happened then you know i just i found out who you were and i just turned in i
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:43.640]  went to uh youtube and info wars dot com prison prison planet dot com and you know i'm like wow

[02:33:21.720 --> 02:33:27.480]  liberties being lost more and more freedom being destroyed our economy disappearing well what do
[02:33:27.480 --> 02:33:33.880]  you think the wages of corruption are it's enslavement it's degradation and that's all
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:42.520]  that's happening right now that's basically uh what we're dealing with here as a society
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:51.560]  we are dealing with a group of people raised from the time their children in front of the
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:59.080]  television said that the government cares about us that the system wants to take good care of us
[02:34:00.120 --> 02:34:04.440]  you're bombarded by all these tv ads and billboards about the government wants you to wear a seat
[02:34:04.440 --> 02:34:07.960]  belt because they care about you and the government wants you to call poison control there's a
[02:34:07.960 --> 02:34:13.400]  problem and the government loves you and the government's the good guy and now right out of
[02:34:13.400 --> 02:34:19.640]  the running man you know steven king novel about the police state where there's billboards up saying
[02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:26.360]  don't trust your neighbors nighttime curfew you can be permanently detained no judge no jury
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:33.400]  all of that is actually now manifesting we are going into the long dark horrible night of classical
[02:34:33.400 --> 02:34:39.480]  tyranny the globalists have taken every form of tyranny and homogenized it and then put an icing
[02:34:39.480 --> 02:34:45.960]  over it of high tech control and we have just been raised i mean these people are going to the
[02:34:45.960 --> 02:34:51.560]  government the same government run by the mega corporations that's totally cheating us robbing
[02:34:51.560 --> 02:34:56.760]  us blind seven ways to sunday and the people are begging it to help them begging it to give them
[02:34:56.760 --> 02:35:02.200]  something the only hope we have as a society is to get government and the mega corporations
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:14.440]  have taken on government power out of our lives we're now entering the final phase of power structure
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:20.360]  consolidation where the private mega banks are actually enthroning themselves with government
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:26.760]  power over countries they sold fraudulent debt and imploded see instead of going to prison
[02:35:26.760 --> 02:35:36.360]  they're so bold they become rulers and there is a man who was a regional governor of the true
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:42.840]  private corporate world government the central private bank system known as the federal reserve
[02:35:42.840 --> 02:35:47.720]  here in the united states same thing in england same thing in europe same thing in australia
[02:35:47.720 --> 02:35:53.800]  new zealand same system where for a dollar to be created a dollar of debt is created on you and
[02:35:53.800 --> 02:35:59.800]  your family's backs instead of money being a symbol of exchange to speed commerce and the economy
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:06.600]  it becomes a system of enslavement that mathematically you can't pay back it's a fraudulent
[02:36:06.600 --> 02:36:13.960]  debt instrument it's a toxic debt asset that only has value because you're assigned to it as a debtor
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:18.520]  and then the globalist trade you as a debt slave around like monopoly money
[02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:25.640]  and then here's herman kane riding in and we're getting these compilations together him on the
[02:36:25.640 --> 02:36:30.360]  campaign trail we're gonna do a lot of specials on this now he's the main guy to go after along
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:35.160]  with mint romney we've exposed to a certain extent rick perry he's on fire crashing and burning
[02:36:35.160 --> 02:36:40.200]  right now if we keep the heat on him who would say the federal reserve i'm going to talk about that
[02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:44.360]  i'm not going to talk about conspiracy theories again their answer is i don't like your monetary
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:50.360]  policy i don't listen to conspiracy theories see used to they said it didn't even exist then they
[02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:55.320]  said it was federal and you were a conspiracy theory now if you don't like their policy you're
[02:36:55.320 --> 02:37:03.080]  a conspiracy theorist but it doesn't work anymore so now herman kane has been running around saying
[02:37:03.080 --> 02:37:08.360]  he wants to audit the fed to make it better now just a few months ago for it even officially
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:13.800]  announced he was running around you can see these youtube videos everywhere saying i think it's great
[02:37:13.800 --> 02:37:19.480]  i think it's wonderful he also said in a clip coming up that alan greenspan was the best
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:26.680]  guy ever at the fed that's the literal architect of getting rid of glass deagle the derivatives
[02:37:26.680 --> 02:37:33.400]  the fraud it's the guy that told the president to appoint bernacky told bush to point bernacky
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:39.960]  his hair and kane's like i don't like bernacky but i don't like that alan greenspan what that's
[02:37:39.960 --> 02:37:52.760]  like saying i don't like i don't like uh stolen but i sure like linen i don't like herman goering
[02:37:52.760 --> 02:38:00.520]  but i sure like that hitler i don't like i don't like rudolf but i sure like santa claus
[02:38:05.320 --> 02:38:10.760]  the architect of this current fraud the guy running it the guy that got rid of glass deagle did it all
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:18.120]  is alan greenspan and here's herman kane saying we did a great job in the 90s when i was the
[02:38:18.120 --> 02:38:23.400]  chairman of the kansas city fed i think it's really good and i and i've got some people i
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:28.680]  want to appoint but that's secret and ron paul like the old owl looks at him wise owl says
[02:38:29.480 --> 02:38:31.320]  oh spoken like a true insider
[02:38:34.760 --> 02:38:40.600]  look i'm gonna go to john listing on 13 10 a.m sunshine network up in upstate new york i guess
[02:38:40.600 --> 02:38:46.760]  it's over by rochester a great affiliate now of 12 years and uh others that are patiently holding
[02:38:46.760 --> 02:38:52.040]  but i want to go to these clips right now again this first clip is and this is only one piece
[02:38:52.040 --> 02:38:56.760]  in paul watson's article he has links to other examples and a link to the page from herman kane's
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:06.040]  book where he called anyone he called ron paul supporters quote ignorant and stupid in his
[02:39:06.040 --> 02:39:14.680]  book and we have a link to it in our article to his actual book where he says and i mean i've heard
[02:39:14.680 --> 02:39:22.360]  neil boards for years which is like the minion of of kane make fun of me sam a liar northwoods
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:31.720]  doesn't exist the fellow reserve is great um i'm a conspiracy theorist i'm gonna find this like
[02:39:31.720 --> 02:39:36.120]  five years ago because somebody called boards i rarely listen but he's on locally i hear it sometimes
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:42.760]  and i heard him like two weeks ago go person called and they said neil you used to criticize people
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:49.160]  it was me but the caller didn't mention that who said that you're pushing the fair tax but when it
[02:39:49.160 --> 02:39:53.640]  came time you wouldn't get rid of the income tax you'd keep the income tax and have a vat and a
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:40:00.920]  sales tax and they're gonna keep fika too so it's really nine nine nine nine to begin and boards is
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:06.920]  like well well herman's got to get elected you know we got a compromise i mean i heard boards
[02:40:06.920 --> 02:40:12.120]  without ever even listening i randomly i'm not listening every two weeks i tuned in of four five
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:17.480]  years ago and he was going this alex jones kook says we're gonna keep the income tax on top of it
[02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:27.160]  he's uh that guy's a nut in a lunatic in a blah blah blah and then here they are nine nine nine nine
[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:37.320]  nine fika social security garbage income tax vat sales tax he says he only wants the income tax
[02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:44.120]  vat and sales with federal control over everything i mean the and then they're
[02:40:44.120 --> 02:40:47.800]  going to start jacking that up this is what the federal reserve in the last few years has called
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:53.960]  for is a vat the cfr is called for it this is what they're doing in europe this isn't more money to
[02:40:53.960 --> 02:40:57.880]  them the federal reserve took over in 1913 and got the income tax through
[02:40:57.880 --> 02:41:08.040]  and only in america would idiot republicans idiots anyone the supporting herman caner
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:15.800]  mitt romney or rick perry are certified morons just like you moron obama supporters totally
[02:41:15.800 --> 02:41:20.600]  financed by the most corrupt elements of wall street and now he says he embraces organized
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:27.400]  the occupy wall street thing is the i mean it's total sham it's like if you're against serial
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:35.560]  killers but uh you want to you know worship uh jeffrey dommer i mean it's it's just you're you
[02:41:35.560 --> 02:41:39.720]  know you're it's like saying you're afraid of dogs so you go to the pet store and get 15 dogs to bring
[02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:52.680]  on with you i mean it's just it's pure lunacy just like this herman kane clip and the clip that we've
[02:41:52.680 --> 02:41:57.560]  gotten our story uh then has some text in between before it cuts to herman kane filling in for neil
[02:41:57.560 --> 02:42:02.120]  boards and this is just one of the mild ones where you know he's he's whitewashing things
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:06.600]  we're digging up a lot of other ones before i go back to your calls uh let's go ahead and go to
[02:42:06.600 --> 02:42:12.680]  this first clip here's herman kane caught in a brazen debate lie get the article at info wars
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:18.200]  dot com is titled fed insider kane caught in brazen debate lie even if you like the federal reserve
[02:42:18.200 --> 02:42:23.000]  maybe you like obama care you like gun control and you like carbon taxes like mint romney does
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:29.400]  and maybe you like the federal reserve financially gang rape in you he lied about it though here it is
[02:42:31.320 --> 02:42:36.360]  since the federal reserve is the engine of inflation creates the business cycle produces
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:41.400]  our recessions and our depressions the federal reserve obviously is a very important issue
[02:42:41.400 --> 02:42:49.000]  unfortunately tonight we have a former director of the federal reserve at kansas city so i have
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:55.560]  a question for mr kane uh mr kane uh in the past you've been rather critical of any of us who would
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:43:04.600]  want to audit the fed you said you've used pretty strong terms that uh we were ignorant and that uh
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:10.440]  we didn't know what we were doing and therefore there was no need for a fair audit anyway because
[02:43:10.440 --> 02:43:13.560]  if you had one you're not going to find out everything because everybody knows everything
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:19.000]  about the fed but now that we have found and we've gotten an audit we have found out an awful lot on
[02:43:19.000 --> 02:43:25.400]  how special businesses get you know bailed out wall street the banks and special companies foreign
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:31.400]  governments and and you said that you advise those of us who are concerned and you belittle do you
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:38.200]  say call up the federal reserve and just ask them to get to the our person so do you still stick by
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:44.440]  this if this is a uh this is privileged or do you think it's very important 64 of the american people
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:51.800]  want a full audit the fed it's higher than that mr kane first of all you have misquoted me i did not
[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:57.960]  call you or any of your people ignorant i don't know where that came from all right now so you
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:01.400]  got to be careful of the stuff that you get off the internet because that's just not something
[02:44:01.400 --> 02:44:09.400]  i have said hit pause hit pause back it up a few seconds we have direct links to him calling them
[02:44:09.400 --> 02:44:15.640]  ignorant and worse still in his own book stupid and and and and all day dues back there getting
[02:44:15.640 --> 02:44:19.960]  clips of this we've got links to it in his book and a clip of him coming up saying we don't need
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:25.160]  to audit the fed but i mean again a little joke about you need to stop getting that stuff off the
[02:44:25.160 --> 02:44:31.160]  internet you mean actual video and audio clips of you talking to the whole world talking to millions
[02:44:31.160 --> 02:44:37.560]  of people you mean like those he is counting on people as a confidence man you know when you need
[02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:43.000]  to start you know getting that stuff off the internet there's another way of saying conspiracy
[02:44:43.000 --> 02:44:48.440]  theory and then ron paul goes um okay i'll check into that you know there's going to be a campaign
[02:44:48.440 --> 02:44:56.600]  ad you know there's going to be a campaign ad showing herman kane lying but it's how good he lies
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:45:02.680]  i mean he doesn't just say that's not true he accuses ron paul and says get your facts straight
[02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:09.160]  let's go back to it or any of your people ignorant i don't know where that came from all right now
[02:45:09.160 --> 02:45:13.240]  so you got to be careful of the stuff that you get off the internet because that's just not something
[02:45:13.240 --> 02:45:20.360]  that i have said secondly when i served on the border the fellow reserve in the 1990s we didn't
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:24.600]  do any of the things that this fellow reserve is doing i don't agree with the actions of this
[02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:29.720]  fellow reserve i don't agree with the actions that have been undertaken by ben bernanke we didn't have
[02:45:29.720 --> 02:45:34.760]  a 14 trillion dollar national debt to prop up with some of the actions that they're taking
[02:45:34.760 --> 02:45:42.280]  and i have also said to be precise i do not object to the fellow reserve being audited
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:48.440]  i simply said if someone wants to initiate that action go right ahead it doesn't bother me
[02:45:48.440 --> 02:45:52.760]  so you i've been misrepresented in that regard i don't have a problem with the fellow reserve
[02:45:52.760 --> 02:46:01.800]  being audited it's simply not my top priority my top priority is nine nine nine new taxes
[02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:10.920]  in july 2011 a partial audit of the fellow reserve
[02:46:11.560 --> 02:46:16.040]  was authorized by congress revealed an unprecedented 16.1 trillion it's actually more than that
[02:46:16.600 --> 02:46:19.960]  in unreported loans the u.s financial institutions and private individuals
[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:28.680]  in 2010 herman kane flatly denied the need for a audit herman kane served as the deputy chairman
[02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:34.840]  from 92 94 and his chairman from some people say that we ought to audit the federal reserve here's
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:41.000]  what i do know the federal reserve already has so many internal audience audits it's ridiculous
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:47.800]  i don't know where why people think we're going to learn this great amount of information by
[02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:51.960]  auditing the federal reserve pause i think i'll back it up to the beginning of it i mean
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:59.000]  because at the beginning you heard him say i've won an audit of the fed but now you're seeing him
[02:46:59.000 --> 02:47:07.560]  back in december last year hosting nilbhurt show that he fills in on saying that we're not going to
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:11.560]  learn anything we're not going to learn anything you don't want to look in there and then we find
[02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:20.920]  out at 16 plus trillion dollars and growing that's with a little tiny congressional audit that didn't
[02:47:20.920 --> 02:47:25.800]  even scratch the surface so we went and dug in one spot in the backyard and found a bunch of bodies
[02:47:26.520 --> 02:47:31.640]  should we keep digging herman kane's like you don't need to dig you don't need to dig now that
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:39.240]  the diggins began he's like i always said dig and out there you ron paul said i called you stupid
[02:47:39.240 --> 02:47:44.680]  i just printed in the book i've just all these clips and he's saying it how dare you getting
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:50.200]  that stuff on the internet and ron paul kind of raises an eyebrow and goes okay here comes the
[02:47:50.200 --> 02:47:56.440]  campaign ad ron paul doesn't say something unless he's triple checked it that guy is a complete
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:02.120]  workaholic the likes of which i've never seen let's go back to the clip some people say that we
[02:48:02.120 --> 02:48:07.720]  ought to audit the federal reserve here's what i do know the federal reserve already has so many
[02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:14.840]  internal audits audits it's ridiculous i don't know where why people think we're going to learn
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:20.360]  this great amount of information by audits in the federal reserve i think a lot of people
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:27.320]  are calling for this audit of the federal reserve because they don't know enough about it there's no
[02:48:27.320 --> 02:48:33.000]  hidden secrets going on in the federal reserve to my knowledge and i tell people you know we've got
[02:48:33.000 --> 02:48:38.840]  12 federal reserve banks but you find out which district you in call them up and go from there
[02:48:39.880 --> 02:48:45.000]  we don't need to waste money with another that's enough i can't listen to the nil boards bumper
[02:48:45.000 --> 02:48:51.240]  music shelling these idiot mainline conservatives and new tax systems on top of the income tax i
[02:48:51.240 --> 02:48:57.480]  told you but being right means i'm bad let's go to break with the next clip uh where they ask
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:03.480]  herman kane who would you hire at the federal reserve as a new person he says alan greenspan
[02:49:03.480 --> 02:49:09.560]  because he didn't get us into this mess that's literally who wrote this mess that was the captain
[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:15.720]  at the ship that ran into the iceberg a few miles down the road we're sinking here's the clip
[02:49:17.160 --> 02:49:23.640]  alan greenspan why because that's what i served on the border to federal reserve in the early 1990s
[02:49:23.640 --> 02:49:33.720]  and the way alan greenspan oversaw the fed and the way he coordinated with the way he coordinated
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:41.000]  with all of the federal reserve banks i think that it worked fine back in the early 1990s now on
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:48.760]  that same point i have already identified uh two candidates which i cannot give their names
[02:49:48.760 --> 02:49:56.120]  to replace mr bananke in anticipation of having that responsibility we must narrow the mission of the
[02:49:56.120 --> 02:50:03.960]  fed first i don't believe in in the fed i believe we can fix the fed by getting that mission refocused
[02:50:03.960 --> 02:50:10.680]  on monetary price stability and i have candidates in mind that will help us so you have two appointments
[02:50:10.680 --> 02:50:17.560]  waiting in the wings for for 2013 for that when his term is up 2014 yes i have two candidates waiting
[02:50:17.560 --> 02:50:23.880]  in the wings how about a hand to take that job i gotta keep them confidential okay congressman paul
[02:50:27.160 --> 02:50:36.360]  spoken like a true insider um no all right that's it yeah greenish fan was a disaster i mean they
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:42.280]  herman kane i mean what a lying con artist you wait till tonight on the tv show we're gonna have

[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:45.320]  ron pulse porters ignorant and stupid on the nightly news and then he just says i didn't say that i
[02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:54.920]  mean it's as big a hoax as mit romney being for gun control i mean serious gun control
[02:54:54.920 --> 02:55:00.120]  control carbon taxes to the point of being praised by al gore wrote the health care bill that's
[02:55:00.120 --> 02:55:07.000]  obama care and he's arguably the frontrunner and the other major frontrunners herman kane
[02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:17.160]  a slick corporate general running around running the federal reserve the absolute enemy of this
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:28.280]  country i don't know who's stupider who's more gullible obama supporters or mainline republicans
[02:55:28.280 --> 02:55:33.160]  i really don't know sometimes because democrats you know they think they're going to get something
[02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:40.200]  free from government they think that the government can be made to be good and and and and and
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:48.280]  redistribute wealth but republicans claim they're smart enough to understand collectivism doesn't
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:55.320]  work and and creates horrors in every instance but then they run to collectivist i mean i i just
[02:56:00.840 --> 02:56:04.520]  like you idiots and i'm talking about people that aren't my regular listeners who've attacked me
[02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:08.600]  in the news months ago when i a year ago when i was telling you about rick perry and now it's all
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:13.960]  come out i mean do you think i just get up here and lie i make occasional mistakes but i'm not
[02:56:13.960 --> 02:56:18.600]  trying to lie to you that's the difference i have a crew in there when i make mistakes tell me about
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:22.520]  them i ask him to correct me because you know you do three hours radio every day you're going to
[02:56:22.520 --> 02:56:27.640]  mess up sometimes but herman kane going i didn't call people stupid and i died i do want the fed
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:33.000]  audited and i don't appreciate you getting that baloney on the internet about me and it's his book
[02:56:33.000 --> 02:56:38.760]  he's a con artist and he's a good liar because when you look at him you can't tell herman kane's
[02:56:38.760 --> 02:56:43.800]  lying he no wonder the federal reserve hired him to run an entire four state division
[02:56:45.400 --> 02:56:50.440]  because the guy is a slick liar i can look at bill clinton and tell you when he's lying
[02:56:51.080 --> 02:56:56.360]  i can look at george bush tell you when he's lying obama herman kane you think it's true him
[02:56:56.360 --> 02:57:05.480]  he's man that guy's that guy's devilish uh let's go ahead and uh take a call here uh let's go ahead
[02:57:05.480 --> 02:57:11.960]  and uh go to john in new york at 13 10 a.m that's one of our oldest affiliates up there part of the

[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:28.680]  short tweet here i want to take them down with a catchphrase it's the fed stupid that's good
[02:57:28.680 --> 02:57:34.040]  direct in the stupid word at anybody in particular it's a generic you know it's very generic it's
[02:57:34.040 --> 02:57:39.320]  it's not it's constructively criticizing you know it's not you know meant to down anybody
[02:57:40.840 --> 02:57:46.200]  that's it it's the fed stupid you know it's like read my lips no new taxes it's the economy stupid

[02:58:03.080 --> 02:58:10.600]  why not go after the big banks and i'm like this is the big banks this is their pooled resources
[02:58:10.600 --> 02:58:17.240]  to create this fraud in fake government buildings with fake government seals it's the shadow government
[02:58:17.240 --> 02:58:22.120]  they're the globalist they're the enemy they're the problem one man stands against them in the
[02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:27.960]  presidential race ron paul we stand with him win lose or draw and then you got the now the new
