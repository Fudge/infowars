[00:00.000 --> 00:11.660]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.660 --> 00:19.200]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.200 --> 00:35.520]  Texas Alex Jones the American paid for fought for and taken the blame for
[00:35.520 --> 00:43.880]  Empire the Empire that the globalist have built that we have basically
[00:43.880 --> 00:49.960]  provided the blood sweat and tears to construct the Empire that's called the
[00:49.960 --> 00:55.400]  American Empire but it's not the American Empire it is in deep trouble
[00:55.400 --> 01:03.000]  mainly through his controllers greed but also their instinct to impoverish their
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.600]  slaves through those activities and through the general population's own
[01:09.600 --> 01:15.600]  decadence we have seen the manifestation of cartoonishly ridiculous
[01:15.600 --> 01:28.480]  levels of Byzantine style corruption and it's now all coming to a head and
[01:28.480 --> 01:34.840]  from here on out it is my historical analysis and summation that it's just
[01:34.840 --> 01:47.280]  going to get wilder and wilder and wilder that's the bottom line we have a
[01:47.280 --> 01:52.920]  top story that I will cover when we start the next segment I'm almost tempted
[01:52.920 --> 01:58.120]  just to air the special report that's linked on red up on info wars.com and
[01:58.120 --> 02:03.480]  prisonplanet.com because we say it's so concisely and focused but I will just
[02:03.480 --> 02:08.840]  break it down live on air the report is titled senator Graham warns of a nuke
[02:08.840 --> 02:18.600]  strike after missing warheads report and if any video report ever got 50 million
[02:18.600 --> 02:24.440]  views on YouTube this is it a news video that gets a half million views has seen
[02:24.440 --> 02:29.080]  as viral some of the most viral news videos maybe you have 10 million some
[02:29.080 --> 02:34.760]  of them are our videos but you can have some fake sex tape you know have 30
[02:34.760 --> 02:40.240]  40 50 100 million or or a hippopotamus with diarrhea you know with 150 million
[02:40.240 --> 02:44.880]  and I mean stuff like that okay it's funny to show your five-year-old but at
[02:44.880 --> 02:50.960]  a certain point this is really important information and if this stuff gets out of
[02:50.960 --> 02:55.760]  hand it could be the end of human civilization as we know it maybe the end
[02:55.760 --> 03:02.160]  of life as we know it on this planet a CBS news reports that senator Graham
[03:02.160 --> 03:10.480]  little neocon war monger and chief the war whore the war Nelly says that nukes
[03:10.480 --> 03:16.400]  in hands of terrorists could result in bomb coming to Charleston Harbor now
[03:16.400 --> 03:27.320]  why is that so important that's important because on Tuesday the same day he came
[03:27.320 --> 03:31.240]  out and gave this speech that we didn't learn about till yesterday via show tips
[03:31.240 --> 03:36.720]  email from a listener a viewer in South Carolina thank you for that tip that it
[03:36.720 --> 03:43.400]  was in all local news that he said it's not a question of if but when a bomb a
[03:43.400 --> 03:57.280]  nuke is going to go off in Charleston in South Carolina now this is on the heels
[03:57.280 --> 04:07.200]  of our report the same day about missing warheads at the base out in west Texas in
[04:07.200 --> 04:12.520]  fact you guys print me Tuesday's report about that or I can do it it's
[04:12.520 --> 04:24.200]  actually linked up right at the top of the right at the top of the story and we
[04:24.200 --> 04:34.240]  are going to be going over that report coming up on the other side of this
[04:34.240 --> 04:38.560]  break and then all the big news Syria developments low and behold they're now
[04:38.560 --> 04:43.240]  admitting it's a full-on bombardment and invasion preparation and the forces
[04:43.240 --> 04:48.240]  lining up for war with Russia potentially and China not for Syria so the
[04:48.240 --> 04:57.160]  globalists are eyeballing using the Syria conflict as the detonator for some type
[04:57.160 --> 05:04.080]  of war with Russia every three seconds someone becomes a victim of identity

[08:17.600 --> 08:37.120]  GCN radio network my friends it is Friday the 6th day of September 2013 will
[08:37.120 --> 08:41.160]  be here for the next three hours live then we'll be back tonight with all the
[08:41.160 --> 08:46.360]  latest developments 7 o'clock Central Info Wars nightly news find out the
[08:46.360 --> 08:51.760]  details at info wars news.com and then I'll be back this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[08:51.760 --> 08:57.920]  Central live with the Sunday show that's why we have two different shows a day
[08:57.920 --> 09:03.000]  the nightly news and the radio show that's why I do the Sunday show because
[09:03.000 --> 09:09.640]  the news is moving faster and faster more and more is happening in fact I'm
[09:09.640 --> 09:14.200]  tempted to start a Saturday show I don't think my wife would be too happy about
[09:14.200 --> 09:20.440]  that I got home at midnight again last night and the reason I'm doing this even
[09:20.440 --> 09:23.880]  though there's nothing more I love hanging out with my children and playing
[09:23.880 --> 09:28.680]  yachts with them or board games or painting or hiking around in the woods
[09:28.680 --> 09:32.280]  or fishing and there's nothing I love more than hanging out with the French
[09:32.280 --> 09:37.840]  Bulldogs on my lap and my wife and and you know cooking supper I love that in
[09:37.840 --> 09:42.040]  fact I'm almost scared to take a vacation I may never come back but I
[09:42.040 --> 09:47.320]  realize they have no future if I'm not here covering this information and
[09:47.320 --> 09:52.760]  trying to get the population not just to the US but worldwide to understand how
[09:52.760 --> 10:01.400]  much danger we're in and info wars.com is hitting massive paydirt politically all
[10:01.400 --> 10:05.800]  across the world people are understanding that our analysis is as close to
[10:05.800 --> 10:09.520]  the truth as you're going to get we're not infallible we don't have all the
[10:09.520 --> 10:14.400]  answers but we do our homework we study we research and we've got our finger on
[10:14.400 --> 10:18.880]  the pulse of what's happening worldwide we know the globalist we know the other
[10:18.880 --> 10:22.360]  power blocks we understand what all their agendas are we've studied the
[10:22.360 --> 10:26.920]  criminology and we're aware of what's happening now I've been telling you for
[10:26.920 --> 10:29.560]  two and a half years because the Pentagon's public about this and
[10:29.560 --> 10:33.680]  Borzinski's public about this these guys all write books and white papers
[10:33.680 --> 10:37.880]  communicating with each other but they treat us like we're dumb animals and
[10:37.880 --> 10:41.840]  lie to us on television every night but then talk to each other and white
[10:41.840 --> 10:47.320]  papers and tell the truth what you're seeing in Syria is all about encircling
[10:47.320 --> 10:53.160]  Russia when they're done taking out Syria and Iran and Pakistan they're going
[10:53.160 --> 10:58.800]  to activate all the jihadi forces encircling Russia backed up with
[10:58.800 --> 11:05.680]  paramilitary forces of the West to basically slice up Russia in pieces so
[11:05.680 --> 11:09.320]  when you hear Lindsey Graham saying that there are you know al-Qaeda jihadis in
[11:09.320 --> 11:15.920]  Mexico infiltrating the US it's true and they hate America as well but they're
[11:15.920 --> 11:22.080]  financed up the chain by the globalist and of course the drooling jihadis
[11:22.080 --> 11:27.400]  aren't even aware of that themselves you see when Lindsey Graham says a nuke is
[11:27.400 --> 11:32.400]  going to go off in South Carolina we're gonna cover that from CBS News in a
[11:32.400 --> 11:37.400]  moment he he is in the same league as al-Qaeda they get power and stand again
[11:37.400 --> 11:41.880]  out of fear Graham gets the national security state and no-bid weapons
[11:41.880 --> 11:48.640]  contracts and gets destroy our liberties and poses our savior via that the the
[11:48.640 --> 11:57.360]  terror threat it's elementary ladies and gentlemen so these these scum that the
[11:57.360 --> 12:02.520]  the the the the Wahhabist jihadis and in the military industrial complex itself
[12:02.520 --> 12:09.440]  run by globalist transhumanist banksters they are all together as a legion of
[12:09.440 --> 12:15.200]  doom a legion of psychopathic sociopathic control freak world domination and
[12:15.200 --> 12:20.040]  they've offered the jihadis the entire Middle East Eastern Europe Central Asia
[12:20.040 --> 12:27.720]  North Africa if they will attack the West and then allow other targets to be
[12:27.720 --> 12:35.200]  bombed so the jihadis can then move in and take over see the jihadis attack and
[12:35.200 --> 12:42.720]  then the West is then able to then actually come in and invade those areas
[12:42.720 --> 12:48.520]  because Americans can't tell the difference between Shiite and Sunni but
[12:48.520 --> 12:52.600]  I'm not going to digress off into all that then you've got Iran that runs
[12:52.600 --> 13:00.360]  Hezbollah that really is dangerous and it really does have all sorts of sleeper
[13:00.360 --> 13:05.320]  cell brigades all over the world and it was threatening to kidnap all the top
[13:05.320 --> 13:09.400]  military brass families and kill them and is threatening to attack every US
[13:09.400 --> 13:13.560]  embassy in the Middle Eastern Europe and it's threatening to then torture
[13:13.560 --> 13:18.440]  everyone to death that they basically get and that is coming out of one of
[13:18.440 --> 13:25.120]  the top experts in the Supreme Council of Experts that elects the Supreme
[13:25.120 --> 13:32.440]  Leader the Ayatollah and they're saying go ahead attack Syria we're going to
[13:32.440 --> 13:36.240]  activate sleeper cells and believe me Lindsey Graham and the New World Order
[13:36.240 --> 13:40.560]  they love that they'll get to pose as saviors when real terror attacks are
[13:40.560 --> 13:45.280]  happening and say see that's why we have the NSA see that's why all this is
[13:45.280 --> 13:51.960]  going on and oh by the way we've got a deal with domestic extremist who are
[13:51.960 --> 13:57.680]  working with the Muslims they'll just say Muslims not Shiite not Sunni and by
[13:57.680 --> 14:03.280]  the way they're having drills in Florida today of taking on tea partiers who have
[14:03.280 --> 14:07.880]  merged with Al Qaeda or who have merged with other groups I mean this is the
[14:07.880 --> 14:11.240]  fantasy they put out the army war college earlier this year came out and
[14:11.240 --> 14:16.600]  said they believe the tear in the tea party is going to merge with Muslim
[14:16.600 --> 14:19.160]  extremists to attack the federal government now of course that's not
[14:19.160 --> 14:25.520]  true that's ridiculous but they're going to tell the paramilitary police that
[14:25.520 --> 14:30.800]  and try to have them start a civil war with us the globalists aren't building
[14:30.800 --> 14:35.760]  armored fortresses everywhere because they're not planning something they
[14:35.760 --> 14:39.040]  want to start a civil war they believe they're going to make it through the
[14:39.040 --> 14:44.280]  civil war that's really the cover for once and for all breaking the American
[14:44.280 --> 14:49.240]  Republic stealing all the pension funds and confiscating our firearms and they've
[14:49.240 --> 14:56.000]  got the police and military trained on record on record for war with the
[14:56.000 --> 15:03.720]  American people I saw a raw story video taking my friend Joe Rogan out of
[15:03.720 --> 15:10.320]  context with a guest he had saying and I had said that the plastic coffins weren't
[15:10.320 --> 15:16.360]  coffin liners and that they were for the American people guys pull up army
[15:16.360 --> 15:21.360]  manual for reeducation camps in America I want to give people the FM number at
[15:21.360 --> 15:27.040]  army mills you can read about this I mean the stars and stripes the Pentagon all
[15:27.040 --> 15:34.920]  the major publications all the major publications are saying oh the army's
[15:34.920 --> 15:37.320]  going to deal with domestic extremists and their gun owners veterans
[15:37.320 --> 15:42.760]  conservatives libertarians it's FM 3-39 dot 40 internment resettlement
[15:42.760 --> 15:46.320]  operations how to process your social security numbers how to take your kids
[15:46.320 --> 15:50.920]  from you how to then brainwash you it's all there go read it let's see the
[15:50.920 --> 15:56.200]  mainstream media has done straw men where they say oh Alex claims that that
[15:56.200 --> 16:01.520]  regular coffin liners are actually mass graves now I said FEMA was stockpiling
[16:01.520 --> 16:09.520]  coffin liners that are used in standard burial as part of a CDC plan to actually
[16:09.520 --> 16:14.120]  use them for plastic coffins to put up to four bodies a piece in it and we got
[16:14.120 --> 16:20.680]  the Bureau of cemeteries in in in New York State Texas and Arizona remember
[16:20.680 --> 16:24.000]  this years ago it's an Aaron Dykes article showing they were being prepared
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.080]  for mass graves and to put people in coffin liners and it all started when
[16:28.080 --> 16:33.360]  we had an emergency manager on from from Indiana that borders Illinois and
[16:33.360 --> 16:38.280]  they said prepare for a million dead out of Chicago to be buried in your county
[16:38.280 --> 16:43.240]  and we had them on the show they were part of a drill and so we began an
[16:43.240 --> 16:51.360]  investigation and found out they were cashing plastic grave liners all over
[16:51.360 --> 16:55.960]  the country that doesn't and then the media is like how dare you say the
[16:55.960 --> 17:00.120]  people whose land was leased to put these on are part of a plan to kill
[17:00.120 --> 17:05.160]  everybody we never said that so they always build a straw man put the straw
[17:05.160 --> 17:11.360]  man out there and then say that we said it by the way I'm not predicting that an
[17:11.360 --> 17:18.040]  atomic or hydrogen bomb is going to go off off the coast of South Carolina
[17:18.040 --> 17:24.560]  Lindsey Graham this the the the creature from South Carolina in front of the
[17:24.560 --> 17:28.480]  creature from the black Lagoon he's the creature from South Carolina they're
[17:28.480 --> 17:32.680]  trying to do a recall on him right now with all the Tea Party folks he's
[17:32.680 --> 17:38.360]  freaking out the words out on Mr. Open Borders Mr. Anti-Gun Mr. Scumbag there's
[17:38.360 --> 17:45.000]  the CBS News headline nukes in hands of terror as could result in bomb coming to
[17:45.000 --> 17:50.760]  Charleston Harbor now I don't know if that's really gonna happen I'm saying
[17:50.760 --> 17:54.760]  if we don't cover this it could be a real threat that they're planning a
[17:54.760 --> 18:01.800]  stage you know a real event but they're gonna stage it and so we better talk
[18:01.800 --> 18:08.720]  about it kind of like a month ago I get a call from one of my law enforcement
[18:08.720 --> 18:13.520]  sources at 9 o'clock at night while I'm at a Mexican food restaurant about to go
[18:13.520 --> 18:22.160]  see the new Matt Damon movie at the time Alizium I walk out in the parking lot
[18:22.160 --> 18:26.120]  make two phone calls to my state police and military source confirm the
[18:26.120 --> 18:33.600]  document call the phone number have them pick up at the army base in Bastrop and
[18:33.600 --> 18:40.360]  ask how I got it the restricted document and then I went and shot a video
[18:40.360 --> 18:47.640]  about how there was a terror alert telling police that there would be terror
[18:47.640 --> 18:53.200]  attacks on the eighth ninth or the two weeks after that in Austin naming the
[18:53.200 --> 19:00.960]  targets as well as Pasadena, California now the next day the Pentagon comes out
[19:00.960 --> 19:06.960]  and says it's a real terror alert we put out but it but it was wrong there isn't
[19:06.960 --> 19:10.600]  a real al-Qaeda threat they just put that out to create fear-mongering then my
[19:10.600 --> 19:15.000]  detractors take that and claim I put out a fake report look nobody blew up

[24:00.160 --> 24:22.360]  alright let me just recap what happened Tuesday and then what broke last night
[24:22.360 --> 24:29.280]  and that is the top story on prisonplanet.com and info wars.com
[24:29.280 --> 24:33.840]  then we'll get into all the latest Syrian news and take your phone calls ahead
[24:33.840 --> 24:39.680]  of Gerald Salente joining us and professor Francis Boyle who wrote the
[24:39.680 --> 24:46.680]  US chemical weapons treaties to break down exactly what he sees happening with
[24:46.680 --> 24:54.880]  the situation in Syria but before we go in the further here I want to be very
[24:54.880 --> 25:03.120]  clear about this I don't know exactly what's going on here I have racked my
[25:03.120 --> 25:07.800]  brain over this I can't believe that we're in the middle of this story and
[25:07.800 --> 25:13.480]  that we broke this I don't like breaking the story it's kind of like if you walked
[25:13.480 --> 25:17.560]  out in the parking lot and some giant gorilla guy you know was beating up a
[25:17.560 --> 25:22.600]  woman you're not really happy you're gonna have to stand up to him but you
[25:22.600 --> 25:30.400]  know you just do it and this stuff falls on our lap and we confirm it I mean I
[25:30.400 --> 25:34.640]  take my licks ladies and gentlemen because this is dangerous you don't
[25:34.640 --> 25:38.480]  need to be a rocket scientist to know this okay when they had nukes come up
[25:38.480 --> 25:44.720]  missing in 2007 stealth cruise missiles they loaded on B-52s and then
[25:44.720 --> 25:51.560]  secretly shipped from Minot North Dakota down to Louisiana people blew the
[25:51.560 --> 25:56.240]  whistle on the base and was six of them committed suicide or got murdered in the
[25:56.240 --> 25:59.640]  next few weeks before investigators could talk to him there was a major
[25:59.640 --> 26:03.440]  congressional and Pentagon investigation and they said it was a bizarre
[26:03.440 --> 26:07.920]  accident they weren't scheduled to have drills they weren't supposed to load the
[26:07.920 --> 26:13.000]  stealth cruise missiles as we pull up the famous Minot missing new Wikipedia has
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.440]  actually got a good page on it with links to the congressional report and
[26:15.440 --> 26:19.040]  they've got a Pentagon Air Force report that actually shows the stealth cruise
[26:19.040 --> 26:23.760]  missiles they look little stealth little stealth bombers I mean they killed the
[26:23.760 --> 26:27.960]  people they killed the people let me explain something they killed the people
[26:27.960 --> 26:31.840]  that were witnesses to what really happened here okay so that'll give you an
[26:31.840 --> 26:38.000]  idea of the courage it took for the individual to contact us through another
[26:38.000 --> 26:44.000]  individual because they know about the NSA stuff obviously and I'm sure they
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.600]  probably even know who the folks are and if you and if you kill these people
[26:46.600 --> 26:49.440]  we're gonna expose it and if something happens to us it's all gonna you know
[26:49.440 --> 26:52.880]  come out we don't really know more it'll just bring attention on to what's
[26:52.880 --> 27:00.640]  going on the nuclear warheads that weren't supposed to be at the Air Force
[27:00.640 --> 27:05.960]  base Dias Air Force base in West Texas the B-1B bomber base and the B-1Bs by
[27:05.960 --> 27:11.760]  the way most of them left a few weeks ago word is there in Diego Garcia that
[27:11.760 --> 27:16.680]  island off the coast of Africa in striking distance of the Persian Gulf
[27:16.680 --> 27:22.400]  they're a first-strike nuclear below the radar weapon an incredible probably the
[27:22.400 --> 27:25.720]  greatest bomber ever made that's that's declassified according to most the
[27:25.720 --> 27:30.040]  pilots I talked to just blows away the B-2 bombers I'm told you know the whole
[27:30.040 --> 27:37.720]  swept wing aircraft and to make a long story short this comes in from this
[27:37.720 --> 27:44.080]  source they're high level on the base I'll just leave it at that everyone's
[27:44.080 --> 27:51.000]  standing there with their mouths hanging up okay and the police there's
[27:51.000 --> 27:54.800]  civilian police on the base my person witnessed this they're the ones that
[27:54.800 --> 27:57.360]  ask questions they're no paperwork they're like hey the base commanders
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.240]  here these are going off and as it went off the base the police went to the
[28:01.240 --> 28:04.840]  truck drivers and said what is where are you going and then there was some type
[28:04.840 --> 28:08.040]  of big fracas over that because they weren't supposed to ask him truck drivers
[28:08.040 --> 28:11.680]  said South Carolina but we don't know where it's going from there now you're
[28:11.680 --> 28:15.120]  not supposed to talk to me leave me alone everybody knew you're not supposed
[28:15.120 --> 28:17.840]  to just have nuclear weapons that aren't even supposed to be on the base and
[28:17.840 --> 28:20.840]  maybe it was a drill or something I've tried to rack my brain maybe they were
[28:20.840 --> 28:24.800]  dummy warheads maybe it was a drill a test they do lots of stuff like this I
[28:24.800 --> 28:29.560]  don't know see when I say I don't know what's going on this is way above my
[28:29.560 --> 28:33.780]  pay grade way above I'm in way over my head but you know what everybody's in
[28:33.780 --> 28:38.280]  over their head who knows what's really going on that's why I'm gonna open the
[28:38.280 --> 28:41.440]  phones up we have a lot of people that were nuclear launch technicians that
[28:41.440 --> 28:43.800]  retired that have called him with accurate info because I study this a bit
[28:43.800 --> 28:47.160]  myself I could tell they're accurate callers there's a lot of people that
[28:47.160 --> 28:50.880]  have driven nuclear convoys I know they move them around in 18 wheelers and on
[28:50.880 --> 28:58.040]  trains that's on record what do you have you ever heard of something like this
[28:58.400 --> 29:02.720]  have you ever said I mean I know special forces usually takes these around
[29:02.720 --> 29:06.480]  and that's who showed up reportedly in plainclothes with special forces out of
[29:06.480 --> 29:12.880]  Florida to be driving behind and in front of these trucks
[29:14.480 --> 29:18.640]  we know that the US doesn't really just have 8,000 warheads used to be something
[29:18.640 --> 29:21.920]  like 30 something thousand Russians had 40 something thousand they claim we've
[29:21.920 --> 29:26.240]  got only 3,000 operational 8,000 total look the point is there's a lot more
[29:26.240 --> 29:31.640]  nukes but the rest of the story the crew came in when these articles came in
[29:31.640 --> 29:35.720]  yesterday from CBS News about Graham saying South Carolina will be hit by a
[29:35.720 --> 29:39.640]  nuke if we don't attack Syria basically and people were had turned white folks

[33:44.120 --> 33:54.080]  Graham warms of nuke strike after missing warheads report and here is the CBS news
[33:54.080 --> 33:59.440]  headline Graham nuke's and hands of terrorist could result in bomb coming
[33:59.440 --> 34:04.800]  to Charleston Harbor now this got almost no national attention until today
[34:04.800 --> 34:09.760]  after we broke this last night this was in CBS local and the other TV stations
[34:09.760 --> 34:15.040]  quoting him saying you look I'm telling you in the next six months there will
[34:15.040 --> 34:23.160]  probably be a bombing in Charleston Harbor by Iran or Syria with a nuke if
[34:23.160 --> 34:29.320]  we don't go in there you can go read his quotes right there and it's linked in
[34:29.320 --> 34:33.360]  our article at info wars dot com that is red link in the featured news area
[34:33.360 --> 34:36.600]  but I'm gonna have that move back to the top you ask the crew to move it back to
[34:36.600 --> 34:44.840]  the top of featured news now move to the bottom now again by itself having
[34:44.840 --> 34:49.840]  Lindsey Graham saying I have intel they were gonna get an atomic weapon or
[34:49.840 --> 34:54.760]  already have one and they're going to bomb the harbor and kill you they're
[34:54.760 --> 34:57.760]  trying to basically recall him right now they're organizing that and he's up
[34:57.760 --> 35:01.920]  there going do what I say or you're gonna get blown up I mean he's a terrorist
[35:01.920 --> 35:06.760]  that's what terrorists do give me political power or you're dead that's the definition
[35:06.760 --> 35:10.560]  of terrorism threatening violence or carrying out violence for a political
[35:10.560 --> 35:17.640]  or economic advantage go read the classical definition of terrorism now
[35:17.640 --> 35:21.720]  they call it you know filming the police now they call it liking George
[35:21.720 --> 35:26.880]  Washington literally well that's the terrorists of course the terrorists would
[35:26.880 --> 35:30.640]  talk like that I mean this is two plus two equals four and I think they've jumped
[35:30.640 --> 35:37.080]  the shark here so by itself what is Lindsey Graham doing
[35:38.160 --> 35:45.320]  running around saying we got to go into Syria or we're gonna get nuked that's
[35:45.320 --> 35:49.240]  like we got to go into Iraq or he's gonna nuke us Tony Blair said he could
[35:49.240 --> 35:52.720]  launch missiles in 45 minutes we got an attack right now and oh these are the
[35:52.720 --> 35:55.600]  mobile trucks that have the anthrax in them when they knew they were British
[35:55.600 --> 36:01.960]  hydrogen trucks to pump up surveillance blimps to direct artillery that the US
[36:01.960 --> 36:08.320]  recommended they buy from England so that the CIA commandos could direct
[36:08.320 --> 36:12.800]  artillery in the Iran-Iraq war so they knew exactly what the trucks were
[36:12.800 --> 36:17.080]  premeditatedly and said that Iraq had done that but I'm digressing that's a
[36:17.080 --> 36:20.760]  problem with having knowledge folks is it's all interconnected you just know
[36:20.760 --> 36:26.200]  what a wall of bullet is so how are they now saying we're gonna get nuked if we
[36:26.200 --> 36:31.920]  don't do this and what did we say you can go watch it in the video that's in
[36:31.920 --> 36:36.800]  the article from Tuesday we said you know this may not just be to covertly
[36:36.800 --> 36:40.160]  ship these overseas because they would have had an official transfer of the
[36:40.160 --> 36:47.040]  weapons this is only done by a presidential order to a commander to not
[36:47.040 --> 36:53.760]  have a record of the weapons and that's very nefarious and the word is it was
[36:53.760 --> 36:58.320]  Dick Cheney back in 2007 that had the cruise missiles transferred out of my
[36:58.320 --> 37:03.920]  not so that that's a scandal Graham saying that they're gonna get hit in
[37:03.920 --> 37:08.880]  Charleston South Carolina by a nuke or he said Charleston or New York New York
[37:08.880 --> 37:13.360]  Harbor or Charleston if they don't do this I mean do what I say start World
[37:13.360 --> 37:20.480]  War three do all this or we're gonna get nuked and the question is you got Putin
[37:20.480 --> 37:25.360]  now saying they're gonna militarily back up Syria I mean just a bomb shell Fox
[37:25.360 --> 37:30.240]  News report linked up on drudgereport.com and info wars.com that just changed
[37:30.240 --> 37:34.680]  the last four hours you've got Russian troop carrying ships arriving and the
[37:34.680 --> 37:38.880]  word is they're loaded folks they're loaded with Spitznatt Marines Spitznatt
[37:38.880 --> 37:43.280]  just means special forces in Russian so you got Army Spitznatt's Marine Spitznatt
[37:43.280 --> 37:48.120]  Air Force Spitznatt's just like in the US you got different branches of special
[37:48.120 --> 37:53.680]  forces and they got specialized Spitznatt's commandos Spitznatt's FSB you
[37:53.680 --> 37:57.960]  know Spitznatt's above that just like it's the same set up here they just call
[37:57.960 --> 38:02.360]  it Delta Force and other groups or stuff above Delta Force folks I will assure
[38:02.360 --> 38:07.120]  you don't even have names men formally associated with special forces is what
[38:07.120 --> 38:14.080]  they're called and I mean it's on ladies and gentlemen and it's not America
[38:14.080 --> 38:18.440]  versus Russia it's global banksters that Russia kicked out in the last decade
[38:18.440 --> 38:21.760]  and arrested and I'm not in love with Russia they're corrupt and out of
[38:21.760 --> 38:26.320]  control but they're not you Genesis now they pay you to have kids Russia's now
[38:26.320 --> 38:30.240]  saying don't take all the vaccines they're dangerous I mean I think Putin
[38:30.240 --> 38:34.200]  actually likes Russians I think that's what this company says get married have
[38:34.200 --> 38:39.320]  children don't take a lot of vaccines don't drink fluoride you know radiation
[38:39.320 --> 38:44.600]  is not good for you over here it's all the opposite kids go out and play
[38:44.600 --> 38:50.800]  sports don't watch television the opposite of what our system and I'm not
[38:50.800 --> 38:55.320]  romanticizing Putin I mean he said it works for a whole underground KGB
[38:55.320 --> 39:00.200]  echelon that really just want to be the robber barons themselves and kicked the
[39:00.200 --> 39:03.400]  Rothschilds and Rockefellers out that's come out in court they kicked them out
[39:03.400 --> 39:09.360]  that most of the Russian stuff was owned going back even to 1920 or so by the
[39:09.360 --> 39:13.160]  globalist like Armand Hammer and Al Gore's dad and all that they made all
[39:13.160 --> 39:18.040]  the money off the Soviet Union kleptocratic globalist ran the commies
[39:18.040 --> 39:21.760]  ladies and gentlemen oh it's for the people you're in a forced labor camp
[39:21.760 --> 39:27.280]  Alexander Schultz and Ethan how's that sound so we've got all this going on and
[39:27.280 --> 39:37.040]  so we put this this intel came in about 9 a.m. on Tuesday for some reason I
[39:37.040 --> 39:40.240]  wasn't told about it until after the show which I guess I tell him don't
[39:40.240 --> 39:45.760]  interrupt me but then some stuff like that they shouldn't interrupt me and then
[39:45.760 --> 39:49.600]  we confirm it make some calls after the show we put our story out about four
[39:49.600 --> 39:54.640]  this came out about 5 o'clock on CBS news and others right after we'd already
[39:54.640 --> 39:58.200]  started putting our report out simultaneously Graham we learned about
[39:58.200 --> 40:02.600]  this the last night yesterday afternoon is saying race for nuke attacks so we're
[40:02.600 --> 40:08.120]  told the nukes are going there and then now he says Charlton South Carolina or
[40:08.120 --> 40:16.120]  New York Harbor those are the targets of the Muslim extremist if we don't go
[40:16.120 --> 40:21.720]  into Syria and Iran and then now Iran chimes in saying we are gonna run black
[40:21.720 --> 40:27.560]  ops on you give you a tax so I mean this is just a complete disaster ladies and
[40:27.560 --> 40:31.280]  gentlemen and I don't know exactly what's going on here and this may all be
[40:31.280 --> 40:37.080]  unrelated okay on my source who I doubt is wrong I didn't tell me this I'm
[40:37.080 --> 40:42.920]  trying to come up with excuses other possibilities maybe it was dummy war
[40:42.920 --> 40:46.680]  heads maybe it was part of a drill maybe they wanted to see how people would
[40:46.680 --> 40:53.640]  respond but my gut tells me this is really scary and really dangerous to the
[40:53.640 --> 40:57.720]  point of I'm not even freaked out really it's so horrible and my gut tells me
[40:57.720 --> 41:02.160]  things are so serious now I'm even more focused I'm just resigned to whatever
[41:02.160 --> 41:05.720]  happens and you look at all the rest of stuff going on the world and I said
[41:05.720 --> 41:10.240]  Tuesday I said Anthony good shardy in the interview we did he said this could be
[41:10.240 --> 41:13.640]  a false flag and I said yes they could hold the east coast hostage they could
[41:13.640 --> 41:18.320]  detonate it and say Syria or Iran did it and then little did I know as I was
[41:18.320 --> 41:24.920]  taping that for the nightly news at like 5 o'clock in the afternoon and it
[41:24.920 --> 41:30.400]  aired at 7 as I was taping that emergency alert for the info wars nightly
[41:30.400 --> 41:35.920]  news Graham was giving a town hall meeting saying that and the media didn't
[41:35.920 --> 41:39.240]  pick up on it nationally you think they would saying we're gonna get by nukes
[41:39.240 --> 41:42.200]  it's gonna happen go read his quotes you know I'm not telling you it's
[41:42.200 --> 41:45.560]  possibility I'm saying it's probably gonna happen if you don't get behind
[41:45.560 --> 41:50.320]  this war and you've got him caught lying about no boots on the ground and now
[41:50.320 --> 41:53.680]  they need boots on the ground and lying and singing ever said red line when he
[41:53.680 --> 41:58.600]  clearly said red line and you've got the fact that they are running Al Qaeda and
[41:58.600 --> 42:03.080]  Al Qaeda is the main force and they're the image of the Al Qaeda bums you know
[42:03.080 --> 42:08.960]  with military lined up shooting them is really freaking people out the exit and
[42:08.960 --> 42:12.320]  then throwing them in wells so the villagers have to fish the rotten bodies
[42:12.320 --> 42:16.560]  out you know so it ruins the water for five years that's an old tactic to throw
[42:16.560 --> 42:20.800]  dead bodies in wells folks those deep desert wells are hundreds of feet even
[42:20.800 --> 42:24.240]  they're able to fish them out they've ruined those wells for years if they're
[42:24.240 --> 42:27.160]  unable to immediately fish out all the dead bodies and that's what they're
[42:27.160 --> 42:31.320]  doing scorched earth they tell the Christians come out it'll be okay they
[42:31.320 --> 42:34.720]  come out they rape them kill them and there's all kind of videos where they
[42:34.720 --> 42:40.840]  say you are a infidel so I'm gonna rape and kill you and there's all these
[42:40.840 --> 42:44.720]  there's a video on the official jihadi sites that drudge report link to last
[42:44.720 --> 42:49.880]  night from info wars.com we're in Al Qaeda operative says we do has been
[42:49.880 --> 42:53.560]  lied and told us we kill women and children we're gonna kill every Christian
[42:53.560 --> 43:02.200]  in Syria oh you have to hear this stuff it's disgusting and you realize our
[43:02.200 --> 43:10.440]  military is training these people in Jordan and it's disgusting
[43:12.120 --> 43:15.640]  put that back on screen guys and take the bug down so folks can read it thank
[43:15.640 --> 43:19.360]  you yeah those are trying to take out the chemicals which produce a lethal and
[43:19.360 --> 43:24.560]  deadly gas that I possess and yeah he's bragging that he's been given the
[43:24.560 --> 43:28.320]  chemical weapons and that of course they're using chemical weapons and you
[43:28.320 --> 43:33.520]  can look at that guy that's not an actor that's the real deal folks when you
[43:33.520 --> 43:39.320]  look at Adam Gadan the grandson of the former head of the ADL that's an
[43:39.320 --> 43:47.520]  operative from a studios in DC on record Pentagon operative just like Amar al-Alaqi
[43:47.520 --> 43:53.560]  but that guy right there you can take that guy is a real Wahhabist jihadi
[43:53.560 --> 43:57.840]  right there we kill the kids and women as well some have been lied and said
[43:57.840 --> 44:06.560]  until they cease killing our women and who are they killing other Muslims who
[44:06.560 --> 44:11.880]  want to send their daughters to college and who want to have freedom in their
[44:11.880 --> 44:18.280]  country and who is the last pouring in like like a poison from the caucuses and

[46:05.520 --> 46:09.120]  us they say you keep pushing fine we're gonna go completely crazy with a
[46:09.120 --> 46:11.680]  symmetrical warfare everywhere and the government's like good we're gonna

[46:36.960 --> 46:41.560]  America create and finance a foreign enemy get giant wars going and then
[46:41.560 --> 46:45.400]  use the big war maybe even with Russia as a pretext to say you better get in
[46:45.400 --> 46:49.360]  line with what the government wants or it's gonna be the end of the world
[46:49.360 --> 46:57.000]  basically we're being held hostage by the crazy crazy globalist yeah let's go
[46:57.000 --> 47:01.960]  let's go chant USA for al-qaeda ladies and gentlemen disgusting so here it is
[47:01.960 --> 47:07.280]  out of Fox News Putin warns Russia could come to Syria's aid as he touched down
[47:07.280 --> 47:11.640]  in st. Petersburg yesterday president Obama greeted him and you guys printed
[47:11.640 --> 47:15.360]  me this it cut it off again I want to put a new printer driver in there so we
[47:15.360 --> 47:18.400]  don't relive this is groundhog day it's not a big deal you have to get IT over
[47:18.400 --> 47:21.920]  with a new printer I don't care what we have to do I just need this where I can
[47:21.920 --> 47:27.800]  read it thanks but there's the article as he touched down the cordially greeted
[47:27.800 --> 47:32.040]  belows the tender box the two leaders are sitting on as they posture and
[47:32.040 --> 47:37.880]  liberate over the potential US strike on Syria one of Russia's closest mid-east
[47:37.880 --> 47:42.680]  allies Putin escalated concerns about the fallout from a strike when he
[47:42.680 --> 47:45.920]  indicated in an interview published Wednesday that his country would send
[47:45.920 --> 47:50.320]  Syria and its neighbors in the region the components of missile shield in the
[47:50.320 --> 47:54.720]  US attacks US general Martin Dempsey chairman joins he's a staff testified this
[47:54.720 --> 47:59.200]  week the Russians might even replace any military assets the US destroy in
[47:59.200 --> 48:05.840]  the strikes and it goes on from there this is all going on this is all
[48:05.840 --> 48:17.080]  happening and meanwhile I'm gonna explain this to you again I'm gonna say it
[48:17.080 --> 48:23.640]  this way it appears secret nuclear weapons cash was disappeared out of
[48:23.640 --> 48:30.800]  Dias Air Force Base and we were told from our source it was going to South
[48:30.800 --> 48:37.560]  Carolina I don't know if that's true but obviously everyone was freaking out
[48:37.560 --> 48:40.800]  because this was completely legal from what I know about law in the last
[48:40.800 --> 48:45.200]  investigation that's happening in 2007 so again I'm gonna open the phones up to
[48:45.200 --> 48:52.320]  former special forces that handled Davy Crockett type systems frog systems you
[48:52.320 --> 48:57.160]  name it my sources weren't even sure what type of warheads are they were they
[48:57.160 --> 49:02.840]  they look like they look like warheads that would go inside well I'm not even
[49:02.840 --> 49:06.440]  sure from what they said you know they look like the type would go on an ICBM
[49:06.440 --> 49:11.760]  because the the Merv pops open and it's got warheads inside of it rocket loaded
[49:11.760 --> 49:15.560]  warheads that come back into the atmosphere the top pops off the nose
[49:15.560 --> 49:20.000]  cone pops off you'll have a bunch of dummies as well and then those will fire
[49:20.000 --> 49:23.040]  out different directions to stop anti-missile systems and then you'll have
[49:23.040 --> 49:28.560]  say half of them that are actually hydrogen bombs but from what I know it's
[49:28.560 --> 49:32.680]  gonna leave it at that they they look like they look like just just the warheads
[49:32.680 --> 49:39.160]  the smaller warheads but not can not not tactical types that a three or five man
[49:39.160 --> 49:44.120]  team would carry so I don't know I don't know again most people who even worked
[49:44.120 --> 49:47.560]  in nuclear forces wouldn't know all this stuff it's all extremely classified
[49:47.560 --> 49:51.360]  I've tried to study it I've tried to understand it Dr. Bob Bowman our big
[49:51.360 --> 49:55.120]  nuclear expert died last week we can't get the former out of the Star Wars
[49:55.120 --> 49:59.360]  program on about that anymore I'd love to be getting his take on what happened
[49:59.360 --> 50:02.680]  here in his knowledge so it's really terrible and people like that die you
[50:02.680 --> 50:08.280]  lose all that knowledge not just a good man and so I need to open the phones up
[50:08.280 --> 50:13.640]  to nuclear strike forces former people that worked in this security folks in
[50:13.640 --> 50:17.920]  the Marines the Army the Air Force that would would would give security on convoys
[50:17.920 --> 50:25.000]  of nukes what do you think cuz I don't know I don't know I mean I know real
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.840]  source freaked out said this is going on going to South Carolina this the same
[50:29.840 --> 50:34.240]  day Graham comes out and says look for South Carolina to be hit by nukes if you
[50:34.240 --> 50:37.520]  don't give up all your rights I mean like literally a terrorist you know bombs
[50:37.520 --> 50:40.200]  will go off you don't do what I say I mean that that's a terrorist that's the
[50:40.200 --> 50:45.400]  definition who would I say are bombs go off increase Homeland Security funding
[50:45.400 --> 50:48.920]  or will be nuked I mean this is this is what they all do big sis all of them
[50:48.920 --> 50:58.360]  800-25-99-231-800-259-9231 and we'll go 20 minutes in the next hour before

[54:58.720 --> 55:05.640]  authoritarian who's been financing al-Qaeda against the Assyrian people when

[57:17.880 --> 57:21.960]  nuclear school dex military got about a two minutes before you go to break what
[57:21.960 --> 57:26.520]  is your take on what I've laid out here sir well quickly Alex I just wanted to
[57:26.520 --> 57:30.080]  talk about that chemical attack attack that happened in Syria there was a guy
[57:30.080 --> 57:33.960]  on CNN they were interviewing and said that he survived that chemical attack
[57:33.960 --> 57:37.960]  by making a homemade gas mask he punched holes in a bottom of a paper cup and
[57:37.960 --> 57:41.680]  stuffed it with cotton batten and held it over his mouth but that kind of mask
[57:41.680 --> 57:45.360]  is no good against nerve agents drop the size of a pinhead on your skin will
[57:45.360 --> 57:48.800]  kill you it's no good against blister agents muster gas
[57:48.800 --> 57:53.000]  lewisite phosphine oh obviously that's pure bull of course yeah I've seen him
[57:53.000 --> 57:57.320]  saying that yeah the only thing that best to help to it would stop with pouring
[57:57.320 --> 58:01.720]  gas that's the first gas the Germans used in World War one and as a
[58:01.720 --> 58:06.280]  emergency measure that the allied and the French and British troops had to
[58:06.280 --> 58:10.320]  urinate on a cotton pad and hold over mouth that was the only thing it was
[58:10.320 --> 58:14.360]  stopped pouring gas anybody can make chlorine gas yeah one reason Hitler was
[58:14.360 --> 58:18.640]  so mentally ill as he got reverse gas three times when the gas would blow
[58:18.640 --> 58:22.960]  back on the German lines real quick all and I'll hold you over and then go to
[58:22.960 --> 58:26.520]  others but what's your take on these missing nukes
[58:26.520 --> 58:31.960]  hello Alex they've gotten away with so much with killing Kennedy the Oklahoma
[58:31.960 --> 58:36.160]  City with 9-1-1 I mean they figured they didn't get away with anything and it
[58:36.160 --> 58:40.600]  may be a false flag it is stay there I'm gonna come back to you
[58:40.600 --> 58:49.280]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[59:19.040 --> 59:24.400]  silvers use a charge of only 110 volts of DC current making supernatural silver
[59:24.400 --> 59:28.920]  hundreds of times more effective against viruses bacteria and fungus

[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:13.600]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:23.600]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:34.600]  we're into hour number two unbelievably serious that word pales in
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:38.040]  significance incredibly dire developments are unfolding we're gonna
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.000]  cover it in the next segment Gerald Salente is coming up we're going to your
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.640]  phone calls right now loaded phones with a former and current military to give
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:52.960]  their take on our source on the military base known to us for a very long time
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:01:00.040]  I'll just leave it at that senior I don't give away too much having to take
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:04.800]  the risk and knowing to tell us that nuclear warheads were pretty much
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:09.080]  illegally transferred from what I know off the basis at the South Carolina from
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.640]  Dias Air Force Base in Texas we've called the base multiple times they
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.040]  freak out when we call they won't respond no one from the bases called us to
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:21.720]  deny this that's another development there we should have a report on that we
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:27.160]  have videos of us calling the base online at info wars.com well I'll recap
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:31.320]  this in the next segment the point is if you just joined us Lindsey Graham the
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:35.280]  senator from South Carolina we now learn is giving speeches saying the South
[01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:41.280]  Carolina must brace for a nuclear attack brought in by ship from Syria if we
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:47.040]  don't attack Syria we may have caught them directly in a false flag I don't
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:51.920]  know but believe me this is bizarre I mean him saying that it's not a question
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:57.120]  of if but when they get nuked in in Charleston of all places I mean how do
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:00.720]  you know all this Graham I mean this is really suspicious John what's your take
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:06.200]  on this? Well like I said Alex they've gotten away with so much they figured
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:09.440]  they're invincible nobody's paid for anything it's been done before nobody's
[01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.800]  got went to prison or got hungover or anything and so they figured they could
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:19.960]  pull anything in it and it could be a false flag it's a but it's hard to
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:24.200]  say it but what I another thing I want to talk about is the that but it's
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.880]  upcoming war it would maybe involve Russia and China is that the Russia and
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:33.200]  China's had a civil defense program for centuries I mean for their people not
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:37.280]  just for the globalists for the people now where's our fallout shelters where is
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:42.080]  all of our chemical suits gas masks you know they don't have nothing nothing
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.280]  but for anybody here I mean I got the stuff here I know how to survive a
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.520]  nuclear attack at least the initial stages of it I've been trained in numerous
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:53.280]  times in army in the National Guard both but the average person they don't know
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:59.240]  what to do well I'm just sick of these establishment people on power trips
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:03.520]  endangering us and if folks don't think they won't start a nuclear war elites
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:08.560]  throughout history do suicidal stuff in fact that's the norm not the exception
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:13.360]  and everybody better be concerned and I think people are concerned you've got a
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:19.200]  9% approval rating in Reuters for this they're getting 500 to 4 phone calls in
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:24.200]  Congress that's that's mainstream news reporting that all these Congress people
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.320]  are saying they're turning against the war because their constituents are
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:31.440]  saying no so it people better care about their kids thank you for the call John
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:36.040]  Steven Ohio former military worked in nuclear what do you think about what
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.360]  we've said here because I don't know what's going on well I'll tell you something
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:46.880]  Alex it does sound like from what you described it does sound like they are
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.940]  nukes that have been moved the big question is this did they also move the
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:56.680]  lower stages with the solid rocket propellant in it now it was just the
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:00.720]  warheads and that and now the person won't talk to us okay well I can
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:05.080]  understand why see because when I was a missile team chief in the men man two
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:10.760]  weapons system I had anywhere from four to seven different silos that I had to
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:16.860]  take care of me and my team and I can understand why he's not talking about it
[01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:21.720]  because it it's an under penalty a death thing man I mean would you die to
[01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:25.560]  disclose that information no I know no I understand this well we were already
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:31.160]  told it went on but then that was it and then it just cut off and again I don't
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:34.440]  want to give out too much info so they can figure it out but the point is is
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:39.600]  that no no the I mean the person knew how much danger they're in doing this but
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.000]  you know you start caring about your kids I'll tell you right now when you see
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.720]  nukes going off the base I don't even want to be reporting this it's so
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:48.000]  dangerous stay there I want to come back to you Steve don't hang up I want to let
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.040]  you talk a few minutes to give your take on this okay sure they stay there and

[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:53.400]  Salentes coming up I want to be clear about something here intellectually but
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:58.200]  also in my gut I know I am in the greatest danger I've ever been in I'm not
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.800]  stupid they killed at least six people that reported the illegal transfer of
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:08.640]  stealth high-tech cruise missiles in 2007 and I've got the entire Air Force
[01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:12.600]  investigation right here was a national news story and when that first came out
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.000]  people were saying it wasn't true for about a week then the witnesses all died
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  but then it came out that somebody was trying to steal nuclear weapons that by
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.800]  the way could fly like 4,000 miles I mean these things look like little stealth
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:29.080]  bombers but they dropped out of the bottom of 52 there it is headquarters US
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:33.720]  Air Force unauthorized transfer of nuclear warheads major general Doug
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.200]  Rayberg investigating officer and there's the two different types of cruise
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:42.040]  missiles that were stolen now ladies and gentlemen no one knows who stole them
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:47.440]  everybody involved fell down and hit their heads but it was ordered and people
[01:09:47.440 --> 01:09:51.880]  on the base spoke out and then they died I didn't ask the people to give us a
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:57.360]  info by the way they gave us this info and now I've got some report there's
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:03.160]  some kind of alert going on at the base and then the commander said that was just
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:09.040]  a joke you cannot make this up I'm going back to your calls this is today
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:15.480]  Abilene airbase commander has zombie defense plan so now they're putting out
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:21.480]  all sorts of weird stories about zombies I'm not joking this is KTXS channel 12
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:25.480]  news by the way they use that as a drill to practice mowing down citizens they
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:28.080]  call those zombie defense drills now these people go you're practicing to
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.680]  kill guys in John Deere hats literally they always dressed in overalls John
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:35.320]  Deere hats they wave signs this is America they and they practice killing
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:42.440]  them we have video on it well now they're doing that at the base so I'm just
[01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.720]  gonna shut up at this point because this is getting too bizarre if you just
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.480]  joined us Lindsey Graham said the day we said we didn't even know this till
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:54.200]  yesterday that Charleston South Carolina or New York Harbor are both a nuke
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:57.240]  target so we don't attack Syria and then an attack could happen in the next six
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:02.000]  months and he has intel and then we learn from our source that they because
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.200]  the police and others that my source witnessed we're like well what do you
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:10.440]  mean you got nukes and it's not signed for who are the what's going on where is
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.760]  this going they're like hey base commander we're going to South Carolina and
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.280]  leave us you know you do your business slam the door I mean that's the kind of
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.520]  stuff going on folks because people know you're not supposed to have nuclear
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:24.480]  weapons drive down the road without authorization obviously came from
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:28.640]  Obama but let's think about this fact what is Obama doing in control of our
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.520]  nuclear weapons this is an anti-family anti-gun New World Order guy that says
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:37.160]  you didn't build your business and he's got the nukes now I'm gonna shut up at
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:39.960]  that point so I'm gonna get to all your calls for our guest comes on Stephen
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:43.800]  Ohio said that he worked on Minutemen I guess that'd be an intercontinental
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:50.360]  ballistic missile and I guess that came out right before the MX I was I'm going
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:53.680]  from memory Steve you've got the floor tell us what you think all this sounds
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:57.560]  like because I don't know maybe it was just some drill and my source didn't
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:01.080]  understand it maybe it's something else well maybe it's a coincidence Lindsey
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.760]  Graham saying this because I don't want this to be true even though my source is
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:10.120]  good and what he saw is true it's kind of like when the police gave me the
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.960]  document a month ago how they were told imminent terror attack a day later the
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:18.840]  Pentagon said that's a real alert but it's not a real threat so maybe this is
[01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:24.080]  something else what do you think about what I just said well I number one let
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.880]  me put your mind to these just a little bit okay the only way it's not like that
[01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:32.400]  they can pop those things out of a nose cone and throw them up in the air and
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.600]  shoot them with a gun and have them go off it doesn't work that way there's
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.880]  several things that need to happen in order for those to go boom okay what
[01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:46.120]  those are I'm not telling you number two I mean it's known it's a special
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:50.240]  special keys that you know turn on the warhead itself special codes that have
[01:12:50.240 --> 01:12:55.120]  to be sent to it that yeah that's the launch okay but when they're up in the
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:00.320]  air and you know and they're on their target there's just there's a set of a
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:05.680]  series of circumstances that have to go on before the warhead can actually go
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:11.640]  boom sure I mean isn't that an ultra ultra low frequency transmission did is
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:16.920]  one of the systems at that that's a yeah that's a different system what you're
[01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:22.000]  talking about is I this is not an exercise they don't take those no cones
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.520]  and nukes and say oh wow okay we have an exercise today take all the nukes off of
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:32.240]  there put them on a truck and take them to South Carolina which they would more
[01:13:32.240 --> 01:13:38.840]  likely end up in Little Beach because if he's talking about Charleston Little
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:45.760]  Beach is exactly where they need to be I don't believe for one second that this
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:52.400]  you know Obama can't say move those the Joint Chiefs of Staff has to say move
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:58.280]  those if he would call me at my site and say move that weapon I'd tell him to go
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:02.920]  where he has to go because it ain't happening unless I get orders from the
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:08.280]  Pentagon and that's where those orders came from if they were moved they came
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:12.520]  from the Pentagon no place let me ask you this why not put them on a plane and
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.200]  fly them there I know they use trucks to transport nuclear weapons that's that's
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:21.600]  come out in Congress but I mean well again I was only given limited info
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.840]  people were freaked out it was done through intermediaries because of the
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:29.320]  danger obviously right and and and they just said it was all completely
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:33.960]  irregular well it is it would be it would be completely irregular because you
[01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:38.040]  just don't do stuff like that okay it's not every day occurs okay then what is
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:42.000]  the point then I don't I mean I don't I mean I mean I mean I'm sure Obama and
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:45.080]  the globalist or whoever can already get a hold of warheads if they want me
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:49.280]  why take them out of some secret mothball at the Air Force global
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:55.160]  company I was in strike command or whatever well it could very well possibly
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.960]  be a false flag attack Alex wouldn't rule that out for a second my half okay
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:05.320]  but I'm gonna tell you this you're worried about your kids I'm definitely
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:09.880]  worried about mine I got them all over the country okay what I don't want to
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:15.560]  see is I don't want to see more kids go in there get blowed up for an absolutely
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:23.000]  no reason okay and then you know you're telling me you're telling these kids
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:30.880]  they're heroes yeah under a false priest you know I agree but not not not this way
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:36.480]  this is wrong well Russia but Russia is lining up sir God bless you make your
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:42.280]  final point I'm sorry you know I mean come on Alex this is if I was to do this
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:47.680]  and take these I would be a terrorist this Graham says that you know Charleston
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:52.000]  South Carolina is gonna get hit by a nuke everybody needs to ask him how do
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:59.400]  you know everybody needs to ask him okay if it happens we're coming for you
[01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:04.600]  because evidently you're the one behind it because you told us absolutely how
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.600]  obvious is this God bless you sir now I've got all these Air Force people they
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:12.120]  can really talk this is an Air Force base who do I go to do I go they're all
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:17.400]  former at Air Force nuclear they're all lined up Don and Indiana you're up next
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:21.080]  and Bill Chris and then thank you for calling in gentlemen Don what do you
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:24.680]  think I don't understand all this stuff
[01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:33.240]  well I graduated nuclear weapons on a two-faced 70s new force that force base
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:42.120]  and that's for their force and upstate New York and I can tell you this nuclear
[01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:50.600]  weapons are very tightly controlled to the point where in our case if there was
[01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:55.320]  any deviation or any threat to those weapons at all we were actually trained
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:04.640]  and we would have done it to kill one another on the spot so the fact that
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:11.480]  they were taken out of that base without and with any kind of suspicious
[01:17:11.480 --> 01:17:19.920]  circumstances that kind of amazes me because the redundancy and strictness
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:25.800]  so what's the control you're not gonna be able to just walk up out of the
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:30.080]  security exactly had to be ordered from the top it had to be ordered from the
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:37.800]  top then remember this happened in 2007 this has happened before yeah but even
[01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:42.280]  that the violation even if it is ordered from the top I mean there's gonna be a
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:50.000]  competition it sounds like maybe there was how they got out of that base but see
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:55.360]  they were coming for it out I know the NRC runs a SWAT team but time boy is real
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:17:59.840]  covert when nukes are going down the road all the time and you don't know
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:06.600]  about it and you know no one does you're very fortunate to get the
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:10.920]  information that you got and the man that gave that to you his life is in
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:17.640]  danger for sure well I mean all I was told is there was a circus and now
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:23.360]  they've told the media oh there was a circus because we had a drill basically
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:29.920]  yeah you know what I think I'm assuming those are the big ones that you were
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.440]  talking about the mobile weapons and I don't know from what I was given it was
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:41.280]  war it was warheads yeah they've been stored like the 80s and on that base
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:46.440]  right on that depot they didn't know there was nukes there that was the big
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:50.320]  freak out it's like these nukes are being taken off the base are like nukes
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:55.960]  they're not supposed to be nukes here yeah well they can be detonated on the
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:19:01.080]  ground they have those large ones the ones I guarded they have six safeties the
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:06.840]  last one is a drogue chute that has to slowly to send in a weapon before it
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:13.560]  fully arms just like that missile checklist telling you but they can those
[01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:17.840]  safeties can be removed on the ground including the drogue chute I know that
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:23.720]  for sure because of an incident that we had on a words my life was based on
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:28.400]  getting into that but they can't be detonated on the ground but my gut
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:37.080]  feeling is those weapons are being taken for some type of Air Force base that
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:44.120]  can be picked up by B-52s or B-1 bombers taken overseas and dropped on
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:49.840]  Russia or exactly exactly that's what we're hoping that it's at least just for
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:54.560]  putting them on planes for contingency but why wouldn't you just why would you
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:20:00.800]  make it all secret then I mean why would there not be paperwork again oh man

[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:16.080]  exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:20.680]  are incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:25.800]  keep your power bills criminally high some have called this a conspiracy others
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:29.760]  have called it a cover-up and you will be shocked to find out how deep the
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:35.920]  conspiracy goes my video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you

[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:44.920]  I got that terror alert in Austin we broke it first turned out they had put
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:49.320]  out a terror alert saying terror attack was imminent to fear monger it was real
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:54.280]  we told you the Navy's fields were saying that their families had been
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:57.360]  murdered or their families were saying that they've been murdered and then now
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:25:01.320]  all that's come out from SEAL Team 6 I mean we told you that within weeks of
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:06.440]  it happening it came out years later I mean I have real sources and I'll be
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:12.840]  honest with you it's starting to really freak me out to have people calling me
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:18.440]  freaked out that are risking their lives to say listen here's the word these
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:21.960]  nukes just rolled out it was highly irregular warheads this is where they
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:25.840]  said they're going special forces with them I mean this is really scary and
[01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:29.520]  Gerald Solente's written a lot about how he thinks nuclear war could start in
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:32.480]  the last decade and they're trying to have war with Russia he said you know
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:35.920]  when they lose it the bankers do they launch war that's what his last
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:40.680]  trends journal was about and you've got all this craziness going on this is a
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:43.280]  short segment long segment coming up Gerald Solente one of the top
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:47.800]  trends forecasters in the world trendsjournal.com Gerald what do you
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:53.160]  make of just Putin now saying he'll give military aid to Syria it coming out
[01:25:53.160 --> 01:25:57.440]  it's a false flag 9% approval rating for the war seems like the best of time
[01:25:57.440 --> 01:26:01.600]  worst of time people are waking up but the tyrants don't care they're full
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.720]  steam ahead what are you thinking about what's happening currently and what do
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:11.600]  you predict well it's not only Putin let's listen to Iran as well Iran is
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:17.200]  promising revenge if there's an attack on Syria and again this is in warm
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:23.400]  mongering or screaming wolf this is coming out of their own mouths and
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:30.000]  being reported by the mainstream press such as Reuters and AFP and others so
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:36.520]  they're making it very clear that if either Israel or the United States attacks
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:43.080]  Syria there's going to be high-level payback you go Alex to the top trends
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:51.400]  for 2012 2013 this trends journal right here you go to the first story and my
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:59.240]  top trend for 2013 was war and we've been writing now for over two years
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:05.640]  about how they were setting up the Syrian conflict as the flash point for
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:12.640]  this war and throughout our writing we kept showing what they were saying you
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:19.080]  know that Syria was loading nuclear excuse me chemical weapons on planes and
[01:27:19.080 --> 01:27:24.120]  on and on and how one thing was followed by another lie and that there was
[01:27:24.120 --> 01:27:30.880]  absolutely no proof but in the public's mind they're getting the news that Syria
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:38.240]  is using gas or chemical weapons so they're setting the public up have been
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:44.880]  setting the public up and all anyone has to do that has a half a mind or really
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:50.080]  cares and now you could of course get it over the internet is the Senate
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:58.240]  hearings where Kerry and Hegel our secretary of defense were playing a
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:05.320]  replay of Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld another cheap act of a secretary
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:11.400]  of state and a secretary of defense selling the people on lives and then
[01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:17.680]  with anyone with a half a brain or that really cares if you could listen to these
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:25.120]  senators one after another babbling on about what we have to do it wasn't a
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:31.320]  man or woman among them ran Paul made a you know some kind of an effort to stand
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:36.480]  up and say something but he was knocked down really quickly and any and he
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:42.360]  folded quickly but when you listen to the stupidity coming out of clown
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:48.480]  Corker the guy from Tennessee's mouth and here's something else Alex I am sick
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:56.120]  and tired of hearing if only women were in charge did the peace on earth good
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:01.760]  will toward men all you had to do was listen to Barbara Boxer boy no wonder
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:08.560]  why Hollywood is going down because the senator from California over there you
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:14.760]  want to see another bad Hollywood act all you had to do was listen to her and
[01:29:14.760 --> 01:29:20.040]  listen to the phony script it was bad as the rest of the movies and then you
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:27.560]  had the other one over there from New Hampshire same bad act all well you got

[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:11.840]  the headline on that as the new trends journal history before it happens this
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:15.880]  year the surveillance state has arrived and they're in the news today
[01:35:15.880 --> 01:35:19.840]  admitting that the NSA does break into your computer without warrants and has
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:23.600]  back doors to everything oh boy green wall dropped a bombshell on us let's
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:28.320]  arrest Snowden this is all old news folks the news is though they've been lying
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:32.960]  to us and now the NRA finds out they're spying on gun owners who would have
[01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:39.000]  thought that they're spying on everybody okay and Gerald Salente I want to get
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:44.640]  into where you see all this going Putin calling Kerry a liar openly Matt Drudge
[01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:47.720]  coming out and saying that the Republicans are a bunch of trash as well
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:53.480]  I mean that's a big shift right there five hundred to four phone calls to
[01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:58.200]  Congress being reported against the war I see a mass awakening can you can you
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:01.600]  speak to that and where we are geopolitically and where we are
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:06.400]  psychologically worldwide and where you see things going Gerald Salente what
[01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:12.360]  I'm most concerned about Alex is there's going to be something that they will use
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:20.080]  either false flag or real to unite the American people in an attack against our
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:25.440]  freedom and liberty and they'll use some kind of something to get the people
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:32.920]  riled up and here's the hypocrisy by the way where are all of these liberals out
[01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:39.440]  there you know the Hollywood liberals the liberals on the MSNBCs and the other
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:46.480]  stations the broadcast and print media and all of those others that if Bush was
[01:36:46.480 --> 01:36:52.040]  pulling the stunt that Obama is pulling now they would be screaming bloody
[01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:59.080]  murder so here's the deal when you have that group already sold and they don't
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:06.160]  have the courage or the respect to speak out and admit they've been conned by the
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:12.680]  commander-in-chief he already has that group now he brings in the other group
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:19.320]  if speaking about Obama if there is something that is alleged to have been
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:26.840]  done look how well they're still selling the propaganda so if there's a false
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:33.240]  flag or some other kind of attack to rally the people they'll do it like that
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:41.200]  that's my fear and as I've been writing for decade now and it and it's not my
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:47.920]  original thinking it comes from Einstein who said I don't know how the third
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:53.440]  world war will be fought but I know the fourth will be fought with sticks and
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:59.320]  stones when I mentioned about watching these hearings you can see what a bunch
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:06.280]  of imbeciles that we have that we call our congressmen and senators and if
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:13.360]  anybody doubts me for one moment just go look at that clip by Nancy Pelosi
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:20.640]  talking about what her five-year-old grandson had to say about whether or not
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:26.600]  Mimi should we go yes should we go no against Syria what do I care what a
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:31.640]  five-year-old kid is what about Alyssa Milano putting on a fake sex tape using
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:36.760]  sex to sell a war I mean I have had it with these authoritarian scumbags so
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:42.000]  what I'm saying is when you see the level of stupidity coming from our
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:49.080]  psychopaths and sociopaths they are going to take us to war in some fashion or
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:53.400]  another I agree with you unless the people continue doing what they're doing
[01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:59.520]  standing up and taking a stand and showing the fraud that this is and by the
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:06.480]  way you mentioned Snowden and Greenwald and remember the IRS scandal and how
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:12.160]  about oh Alex why should we talk about those crappy unemployment numbers that
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:19.560]  came out that were way below expectations they expected over 180,000 crappy
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:27.040]  jobs to be reported because as a fact 97% of all the jobs that were created in
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:33.760]  the last year or part-time work they expected 180,000 it came on around 169,000
[01:39:33.760 --> 01:39:42.840]  and then they revised downward those June and July and now there's 90
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.440]  million 473,000 people out of the workforce 10 million permanent jobs
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:53.560]  lost under Obama I mean we're in a depression and let's talk about Syria you
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:59.000]  see what I'm saying there just when as I've been saying over and over when all
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:04.280]  else is lost they take you to war so they have the people's minds off what
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:10.800]  matters most and that's their livelihood and a future so they're using this and
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:17.560]  very effectively to change the subject exactly now look what's going on with
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:22.040]  interest rates the fear as interest rates go up this is an interest rate
[01:40:22.040 --> 01:40:27.720]  recovery they are setting in our minds now that the tapering is going to have
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:31.800]  to stop in a couple of weeks matter of fact what's the vote coming up
[01:40:31.800 --> 01:40:38.520]  September 9th the Fed meets around the middle of the month so if they decide to
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:44.880]  do something Congress bends over and bows down to El Presidente and they
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:50.720]  decide some kind of a military action the Fed could get then get away with this
[01:40:50.720 --> 01:40:57.120]  tapering because here's the other end of the deal the only reason the emerging
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:02.320]  markets emerged at all is because all of the cheap money that the Fed has been
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:06.120]  pumping into the system and again you don't have to believe me pick up the
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:10.200]  financial times and read it for yourself yeah when they stop doing it it's gonna
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:14.640]  make the world economy go in the toilet exactly so it's already going into the
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:22.520]  toilet look what's happening to the Indian Rupiah the rupees down it's at
[01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:27.520]  all-time lows and now they're putting on restraints so the money doesn't keep
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:31.120]  flowing out of the country they're doing the same thing in Brazil with the
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:36.240]  real is that's crashing and then you tie in the other element of the big lies
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:41.320]  and the big psychopaths that cat over there over in Turkey oh you know
[01:41:41.320 --> 01:41:45.280]  Erdogan yeah the one that were people were rebelling about just a couple of
[01:41:45.280 --> 01:41:50.840]  months ago and holding these mass demonstrations yeah the Turkish and
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:58.240]  Lida is crashing the economy the stock market has lost a third from its high in
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:02.920]  May put in layman terms for folks historically when empires and countries
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:06.880]  start failing the crooks will take you to war now we've got nuclear weapons
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:10.240]  let me ask you this question when I watched Tuesday and Wednesday those
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:15.920]  hearings of the scum especially in the Senate and how how arrogant and
[01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:20.520]  obviously narcissistic and it's not fair to say feminine because that's a
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:24.680]  mean to women I mean the men were a bunch of candy asses I'm sorry to use that
[01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:28.000]  word you could just see they weren't men you wouldn't want to drink a beer with
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  them you wouldn't want to go hang out we wouldn't want to go fishing with them
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:36.840]  they just all look like repugnant slimy pervert creeps I mean we really are
[01:42:36.840 --> 01:42:43.880]  ruled by slop I agree and I just want to make that point with Turkey now this
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:50.000]  guy Erdogan he's screaming for more war against Syria's destruction and exact
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.120]  and that's their neighbor they have nine you know about it you know a 900-mile
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:43:00.000]  border that they share and so he's beating the war drums and the Turkish
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:05.760]  are one of the biggest armies in NATO so this is what I'm saying and I agree by
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:11.840]  the way what you said any of those guys we use that term loosely at that Senate
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:16.560]  hearing you know you know I wouldn't want to be around them if a fight broke
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:24.200]  out man and I needed some help and and did you see the way how Kerry folded so
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:31.440]  quickly when he asked the Joint Chief of Staff over there to come and defend him
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:36.360]  when Rand Paul was asking him a question and the guy said well I have
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:42.400]  nothing to say and under his breath Kerry said words to the effect well you
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:47.840]  just threw me under the bus that's what kind of cheap act this is and I
[01:43:47.840 --> 01:43:55.400]  illustrate that so that the people listening could understand that we
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:44:04.680]  don't have a lot to fight against if we stand up as individuals with courage
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:09.800]  exactly that they will fold like deck chairs they're setting up homeland
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:14.000]  security and all this intimidation because they're all a bunch of corrupt
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:19.560]  torps who are so delusional they think it's a manly to dominate the few final
[01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:25.680]  countries they don't control they they are absolutely the plague to our society
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:29.960]  I want to jam in some quick calls and come back and and get your ideas and
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:33.760]  how to turn this around but but just briefly looking at this then if you've
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:38.880]  got 500 to 4 on average you know the calls into Congress they're all
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:43.960]  reporting this a different Congress some say it's 500 to 4 a hundred to 1
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:50.800]  249 to 2 but it's over 99% of the calls are against it and they're still
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:54.720]  saying we've got to have war and McCain goes on CNN and goes well I did get
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:58.480]  yelled at all the town halls but I think they're starting to turn around and
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:01.520]  you know want to help the people when the West started the war and I want to
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:08.040]  play this Putin clip of him laughing and saying Kerry tells lies that everyone
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:12.040]  knows his lies that and then they're laughing at us almost in a freaked out
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:15.760]  way because it's creepy they're not lying about something I didn't have sex
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:18.600]  with that woman and you don't know if it's true or not for a while this is
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:23.200]  lying naked like your kids got both hands the cookie jar and they're saying I
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:26.120]  don't have my hands of the cookie jar here's Vladimir Putin I want your take
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:32.840]  on this I've watched debates in Congress a congressman asked Mr. Kerry is there
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:37.320]  okay to people say they've gotten stronger he says no I say officially they
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:42.320]  aren't there the main combat unit the so-called al-Nursa is a unit of al-Qaeda
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:47.520]  they know about this it's not pleasant for me to see this while we communicate
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:51.280]  with them and assume that they are decent people he lies openly and he knows
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:57.300]  that he lies this is sad wow and then they start laughing but almost in a
[01:45:57.300 --> 01:45:59.520]  freaked out way and I look at the Russians and I talk to some high-level
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:04.040]  media I know as I know you know they're actually genuinely freaked out and our
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:08.560]  government media isn't they think it's all fun to have nuclear war and and
[01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:14.960]  again what Putin said about Kerry lying about who our so-called allies are do
[01:46:14.960 --> 01:46:20.120]  you need any more proof than this that was in yesterday's toilet paper of
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:26.520]  record of al-Qaeda assassinating these guys that are kneeled down look at this
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:32.920]  brutality look at the Christian villages that they are attacking and and it's
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:39.640]  hardly making the news at all so the the Putin is a hundred percent right
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:47.680]  they're lying and but the but the other part of the story Alex is also again
[01:46:47.680 --> 01:46:53.040]  what's going to happen if they go to war and here's something from a trends
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:47:02.560]  journal top 10 trends 1998 as reported this past September Russia has lost
[01:47:02.560 --> 01:47:09.680]  track of more than 100 suitcase size nuclear bombs each capable of killing
[01:47:09.680 --> 01:47:16.040]  up to a hundred thousand people and I go on to say about all the other weapons
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:22.520]  of mass destruction that had been on the black market people forget this when
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:29.200]  the former Soviet Union broke up so what's going to happen here but by the
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:37.200]  way I was brought down to VMI Virginia Military Institute in 2000 to speak
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:42.520]  about new millennium warfare and what it would look like actually I had lunch
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:47.160]  with General Anthony Zinni a fine gentleman by the way who was opposed to
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:53.680]  a lot of what's going on then and what's going on now and what I taught and you
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:57.880]  know how they say the generals are always fighting the last war so they brought
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:03.800]  me down to give them a trans eye view of what new millennium warfare would look
[01:48:03.800 --> 01:48:10.360]  like so now let's put this into perspective if there's a attack against
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:16.440]  the United States let's suppose a biological warfare biological warfare
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:22.280]  breaks out in San Francisco let's say a dirty bomb goes off in Atlanta or a
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:28.520]  suitcase size nuke even in Paris or London now we'll put this into
[01:48:28.520 --> 01:48:35.600]  perspective when they had the Boston Marathon bombing back in April they
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:41.520]  closed down a hundred square miles of Boston to hunt for a 19-year-old kid
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:48.400]  business stopped do you realize what this will do to the global economy if
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:56.000]  there is a retaliatory attack against the United States invasion or attack in
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:49:05.080]  Syria of a magnitude 9-11 or plus this whole economy crashes we have a as
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:11.360]  anyone can see by watching that Senate hearing we have incompetent people with
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:17.400]  no plans at all in place that are going to lead us to disaster if they had a
[01:49:17.400 --> 01:49:22.880]  close down a hundred square miles to hunt for a 19-year-old kid hiding in a
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:29.160]  boat could you imagine what's going to happen if there's real warfare it's
[01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:33.680]  incredible it's jamming a call I'm speaking of nukes ex-military transferred
[01:49:33.680 --> 01:49:37.920]  weapons Mike in Texas and Chris and Bill and others going to Chris next Mike
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:42.140]  what's your what's your take on the report I've got a missing nukes out of
[01:49:42.140 --> 01:49:48.240]  West Texas going to South Carolina well Mike I currently work for the
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:54.520]  government that transport these weapons and I believe I have I've never been to
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:50:02.560]  Dias Air Force Base so I believe that is kind of a hoax well no sir we we said
[01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:06.560]  point one that there weren't supposed to be nukes there these are nukes that came
[01:50:06.560 --> 01:50:09.920]  out of mothballs I mean you know there's a whole program of hidden nukes you know
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:14.480]  they didn't really get rid of them in the start treaty right what I understand
[01:50:14.480 --> 01:50:19.920]  that but each of these weapons they need to be upgraded so even though they are
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:26.600]  retired they still need to be maintained and make sure inspected I should say well
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:30.640]  and I'm aware of that so and I hope everything's okay but I mean I have a
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:35.760]  real source that's I don't want to say how high level they're at the base is
[01:50:35.760 --> 01:50:39.280]  pretty freaked out about this so I said was it a drill are they lying to them
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:43.280]  as I'm telling you we got this report let me ask you this Mike how many times
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:46.280]  we told you we have a report and then later it comes out it's true I mean how
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:51.400]  many times we heard that say in the last month a couple I mean so I'm just
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:56.520]  telling you I mean this happened it might have been some fake drill or
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:59.600]  something like I'm hoping that's the case we'll be back with more calls and

[01:54:58.960 --> 01:55:03.320]  but I know this I'm not gonna give any details how they can figure out who it
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:09.440]  is they probably already have this is a known person okay and senior and they
[01:55:09.440 --> 01:55:13.520]  were freaked out saying they're not supposed to be nukes here so this went
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:18.160]  on okay and then suddenly we were told is going to South Carolina now Lindsey
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:21.720]  Graham is saying South Carolina is going to be bombed if you don't give up
[01:55:21.720 --> 01:55:26.200]  your rights I mean that's terrorism whether it's true or not let's go to
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:31.160]  Chris in Texas ex-air force worked in nuclear we got Gerald Salente with us
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:36.680]  to chime in what is your take on what you heard? Hey Alex great to talk to you
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:43.680]  I'm former US Air Force security specialist prior to getting recruited
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:51.520]  into special operations in US Army what I will say is the fact that the base
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:56.240]  commander or the base came out soon afterwards and said there was some sort
[01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:01.680]  of you know I guess you could say drill going on with zombies to me definitely
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:07.200]  confirmed that they're trying to cover up some some sort of activity or event
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:10.960]  that did take place what I will say though since I've been involved with
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:15.440]  nuclear weapons convoys I'm very familiar with launch control facilities
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:20.400]  and the silos and all the security procedures the people that will know
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:24.760]  where weapons are and would be in charge of protecting them would be the
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:28.800]  security specialist they're the blueberries the guys trained in air
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:34.560]  air group the Air Force or base defense they call it air ground defense or Air
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:40.280]  Force base defense and those are the guys that if there was any transfer taking
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:45.320]  place they would be the ones in a sense handing off any activities on the base
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:50.960]  to a contracting agency that would be loading up the weapons absolutely and
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:54.440]  again I don't want to say too much here I mean obviously the government knows
[01:56:54.440 --> 01:57:00.440]  all this or knows how to figure out it yeah yeah but well all I'm told is that
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:04.160]  all went on and people were freaked out and then they won't give any more
[01:57:04.160 --> 01:57:07.840]  details and I'm getting no more info so that's why I'm opening the phones up
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:13.000]  here solution I think a solution would be for everybody to start contacting
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.680]  Brigadier General Glenn Banner of the Seventh Bomb Wing the commander of the
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:24.400]  base especially if it's media personnel and the congressman all that of that
[01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:28.880]  area of Texas and challenge them and say what took place in your base we've
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:33.360]  heard these reports you know confirm deny it what do you have to say get some
[01:57:33.360 --> 01:57:38.720]  of these higher-end base officials to have to make statements either denying
[01:57:38.720 --> 01:57:41.880]  or backing up so they're on record sir sir you're an absolute you're an

[02:01:05.720 --> 02:01:09.800]  got cut off by the break this is a short segment long segment coming up you were
[02:01:09.800 --> 02:01:15.120]  getting into a quote from a trends journal you did 13 years ago about the
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:19.400]  new nature of warfare and then you also went to the US military and gave them a
[02:01:19.400 --> 02:01:24.560]  presentation on 21st century warfare please continue yeah this is what I wrote
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:29.200]  and continuing it and it's rather than the I said wars on a global scale of
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:34.080]  wars between mismatch adversaries will no longer require big armies navies or
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:42.080]  air forces instead a new era of quote briefcase warfare will be ushered in
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:48.560]  eliminating the traditional battlefields and pitched battles between clearly
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:55.840]  delineated enemies unable to face off against the unchallengeable and vastly
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:02.200]  superior military might of the United States enemies within and outside the
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:09.400]  US borders will rewrite the rules of engagement it's going to be this kind of
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:19.840]  briefcase warfare if the United States continues its policy of engaging us in
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:33.040]  foreign entanglements today Alex 6 September 6 1777 not more than a few
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:40.640]  hundred feet away from me is the Senate House where New York State formally
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:48.000]  became a state and this was the first capital of New York State and every one
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:52.960]  of the founding fathers and this area of course as its roots in the revolution
[02:02:52.960 --> 02:02:59.440]  warned us about becoming involved in foreign entanglements and now we have
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:04.800]  all of these little girls and boys that are selling out our country and
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:14.520]  threatening our future to take us into a war for what I agree with you why do you
[02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:19.240]  think our elite is so creepy and and weird and and Kerry looked like he was
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:22.800]  about to collapse the whole time and then they're not worried as Russian and
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:27.440]  shiny ship show up and as everything gears up and as Iran threatens to rape
[02:03:27.440 --> 02:03:34.000]  Obama's daughters I mean this is really getting bad why why did Jeffery Jeffery
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:41.000]  Dahmer like to eat little kids they're sick and nobody wants to call it what it
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:47.800]  is look at their behavior who among us would associate with these people on a
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:54.360]  social level as I said before you know these are the same people you couldn't
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:59.400]  stand in high school in college that wanted to become class president and
[02:03:59.400 --> 02:04:04.880]  head of the student council and now they follow their career path you know you
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:09.000]  know they give drug tests for everybody you know if you get a government job I'd

[02:09:37.920 --> 02:09:42.240]  nukes that weren't supposed to be since 86 or so under the start treaty
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:47.400]  under Argus 87 at the Dias Air Force Base the big Air Force global command
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:53.280]  for nuclear strikes wasn't supposed to be there anymore but out of mothballs
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:10:00.200]  they appear and there were base head to head base officers out there police
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:05.800]  local police security people special forces there to get the special forces
[02:10:05.800 --> 02:10:10.680]  out of Florida Army there to get warheads and ship them to South Carolina
[02:10:10.680 --> 02:10:16.800]  and no paperwork was signed and the the person we talked to was it very freaked
[02:10:16.800 --> 02:10:21.360]  out by the way I didn't even ask for this leak want to make that clear this
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:25.480]  just came into my office we called the base they won't deny it we're three days
[02:10:25.480 --> 02:10:30.040]  into this we're making more phone calls but we bring my reporters in here I know
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:35.400]  they've been calling and stuff get me Jack Jackson and Gucci already because
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:38.440]  I don't they're making the calls and they were making those calls three hours
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:41.480]  ago I didn't know what happened another videotaping and everything but I need to
[02:10:41.480 --> 02:10:45.880]  know Gerald Salente's on with us at trendsjournal.com giving us his take on
[02:10:45.880 --> 02:10:49.400]  all this we're going to a few phone calls real quick and then final comments
[02:10:49.400 --> 02:10:52.920]  from Gerald Salente on other key trends he's watching and where he thinks the
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:56.520]  future of Obama's going but let's go real fast call or make your point I'll
[02:10:56.520 --> 02:11:00.360]  move the next person thanks for holding we'll go Bill John Bill Justin and Ken
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:04.560]  they'll be it for calls Bill in Georgia thanks for holding retired US Navy with
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:09.360]  info on nukes you've heard the story what's going on Graham now saying South
[02:11:09.360 --> 02:11:13.920]  Carolina is a nuke target if we don't attack Syria do you think there's
[02:11:13.920 --> 02:11:17.120]  nothing to worry about do you think I'm connecting things that aren't connected
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:21.960]  do you think this is important I think you're making the right connections I
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:26.240]  think we might be pushing it a little further than necessary the nuclear
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:29.640]  weapons are controlled by the Department of Energy they don't actually belong to
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:33.480]  the military every one of them is serialized and every one of them has a
[02:11:33.480 --> 02:11:39.240]  chemical slash elementary marker so if it one was detonated it would be possible
[02:11:39.240 --> 02:11:43.920]  to for instance they find out where they came from and what plant they were
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:48.720]  actually developed I understand they're jacketed by certain things that'll then
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:54.120]  put off an isotope that fingers it but it's easy to rejacket them and set
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:58.480]  somebody up look all I'm telling you is you saw the my knot missing cruise
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:03.400]  missiles five to six years ago so we we know that was a big setup I mean the
[02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:06.840]  issue was is they were transferred improperly is why the people were
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:10.920]  freaked out right and that's a great point because the minute that something
[02:12:10.920 --> 02:12:14.920]  like that comes out into the public the Department of Energy is going to require
[02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:19.760]  that every military nuke known on record to be immediately inventoryed within a
[02:12:19.760 --> 02:12:24.520]  matter of days if not a week and they'll trace down whether or not something's
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:28.920]  missing and if they don't trace it down then we've got a problem it sounds like
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:34.800]  to me that maybe a information false flag to try to push Congress to point to
[02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:41.440]  Syria to try to have a reason to get Congress to vote to bomb Syria
[02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:44.840]  sure so you're saying state you're saying it can be a false flag or just the
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:48.640]  idea that nukes are floating around what have helicopters fly over they'll
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:52.240]  pick up the radiation then they move them to freak out other members of the
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:57.240]  military well it I think it's more to freak out the Congress to get Congress
[02:12:57.240 --> 02:13:01.760]  to vote to bomb Syria by saying that hey we got missing nukes and it may have
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:05.280]  been stolen by Syrians that are going to use it to freaking hit South Carolina
[02:13:05.280 --> 02:13:09.360]  and I was state stationed in Charleston South Carolina I don't know if they
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:13.040]  still got it but once upon a time they used to store nuclear weapons north is
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:16.800]  Charleston South Carolina and the Savannah Nuclear River power plants not
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:20.840]  far from there that's what the caller said earlier no no in fact that's what
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:25.560]  we were also told as well it's just this was all done in a irregular fashion but
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:29.720]  this source is known to us I'll just leave it that for a long time so they
[02:13:29.720 --> 02:13:34.720]  they saw this happen this isn't somebody planning a story on us to get us to
[02:13:34.720 --> 02:13:40.560]  fearmonger because I've already thought about that wow thank you so much what an
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:45.480]  informative caller there Gerald what's your take on that Gerald Salente well you
[02:13:45.480 --> 02:13:51.600]  know as I said you know they're going to use something and and and the caller
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:57.800]  made a point about you know more fear in hysteria but I have to say this you
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:02.600]  could say anything you want about the American people but look how many of my
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:08.480]  hip to what's going on and as you had pointed out we're hearing that calls
[02:14:08.480 --> 02:14:13.800]  going into Congress are writing up 500 to 1 against and then you're looking at
[02:14:13.800 --> 02:14:18.560]  the polls that are showing as you I think you said 9% of the people only
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:24.800]  support an attack so I think all of this is very encouraging even with a lot of
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:30.680]  fear monger with the fear mongering going on the people are saying no more to
[02:14:30.680 --> 02:14:37.680]  war and I believe that that to me is that what should be being pushed a lot
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:45.040]  more now let the people vote you want to go to war let us decide not a bunch of
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:50.120]  politicians who are getting paid off by the defense industry as we're seeing
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:55.160]  from all of these reports that are coming out about all of those people in the
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:15:00.560]  so-called foreign intelligence the foreign intelligence committee those that
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:05.720]  voted for it got 83% according to Reuters more money from the defense
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:11.760]  establishment than the other senators so my rules of peace are anybody that wants
[02:15:11.760 --> 02:15:16.760]  to take a shot out man go do your work you know keep me out of your psycho trip
[02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:21.880]  you want to take call them out take them out and number two let the people
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:27.160]  vote we don't have a representative form of government that's only for little
[02:15:27.160 --> 02:15:32.360]  kids they represent the people that give them the most amount of money in white
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:36.480]  shoe boy talk they call it campaign contribution how do you think it's
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:40.120]  going to end for Obama because he was their great front man meant to sell all
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:44.720]  this it seems everybody's turning against him right now I think Obama's
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:48.880]  gonna pull a fast one you know this guy says somewhere between a snake and a
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:54.040]  weasel and he'll come out with something and he really knows how to put on a good
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:15:59.720]  show I watched a body language by the way of him when he came out of that car
[02:15:59.720 --> 02:16:04.520]  walking over to Putin very you and I met each other a couple you know we don't
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:10.760]  come out with our arms extended out to here to shake hands there's a lot going
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:15.680]  on behind the scenes over here you know people say sky some Kenya what I think
[02:16:15.680 --> 02:16:21.360]  he's from another planet you know and so I don't think that you know and I say
[02:16:21.360 --> 02:16:26.520]  that in jest but I also say it with there's something else going on here
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:32.160]  and psychopaths and sociopaths don't go down easy also Obama would not look
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:36.320]  Putin in the eye who was trying to talk to him and Obama turned away and I saw
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:40.760]  multiple videos where Putin would try to go over and talk to him and and and Obama
[02:16:40.760 --> 02:16:45.440]  now will not even really talk to him pick up the trends journal that you have
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:52.800]  that we just sent you and I wrote about how Obama canceled the meeting that was
[02:16:52.800 --> 02:16:58.480]  supposed to remember you got that you know about two weeks ago Obama canceled
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:17:06.600]  the meeting that was scheduled with Putin a summit between them using the
[02:17:06.600 --> 02:17:13.200]  Snowden thing because Russia wouldn't deport him back to the United States so
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:20.280]  Obama had already canceled the meeting long before the G20 meeting began they
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:25.440]  were supposed to hold a private meeting it's right there in the trends journal
[02:17:25.440 --> 02:17:30.800]  it's on record he did that yes and the reason they canceled it had nothing to
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:37.960]  do with Putin it had everything to do in my belief with this setup for a war
[02:17:37.960 --> 02:17:43.040]  with Syria absolutely they don't want they don't want diplomacy real quick
[02:17:43.040 --> 02:17:48.040]  let's talk to Bill and Maine X Marine with access to secure info Bill what's
[02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:51.880]  your quick take on this missing nuke story and Lindsey Graham is in the news
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:56.680]  saying that that South Carolina will be hit by nukes if we don't invade Syria I
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:18:00.240]  mean that's big news but it's not making big news it's big news to me what's
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:04.760]  your take on this Bill well I fully believe that and by the way I have 30
[02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:08.520]  years I'm retired Maria I worked in black ops and I did a lot of a lot of
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:12.080]  secure a lot of secure work I have access to secure information I also have
[02:18:12.080 --> 02:18:17.160]  some information that might interest you I fully believe that it's a very good
[02:18:17.160 --> 02:18:23.120]  possibility because if those are in there we receive secure we've intercepted
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:27.920]  radio radio from China we've been intercepted radio signals and they're
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:32.440]  saying that Washington DC is being targeted for a possible strike we don't
[02:18:32.440 --> 02:18:38.200]  know if it's nuke or what it is and it's set up for 9-11 now that makes no
[02:18:38.200 --> 02:18:40.680]  sense to me because none of the politicians are going to be there that
[02:18:40.680 --> 02:18:43.120]  day they're all going to be gone all the Patriots are going to be there I can
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:46.040]  assure you there's not going to be a single politician anywhere in Washington
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:53.400]  that day which means the targeting would probably be the Patriots so basically
[02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:58.400]  what we're looking at here like I said we the intercepts with DOD computers
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:02.600]  going nuts everything is just it's very easily possible that's what they're
[02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:09.920]  going to use and blame it on Syria and say Syria nuke the US and start World
[02:19:09.920 --> 02:19:14.240]  War three wow yes all right I appreciate your call sir we're going to go to break
[02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:18.040]  here let Gerald go Gerald thank you so much for your time I think everybody

[02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:30.160]  advice you think Gerald that's great advice and also the point that was just
[02:19:30.160 --> 02:19:36.160]  made 9-11 they're gonna you're gonna they're gonna do a show on 9-11 to
[02:19:36.160 --> 02:19:41.840]  freak people out like you won't believe nothing has to happen something may
[02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:46.880]  happen I don't know something may not but they will use it as a terrorist
[02:19:46.880 --> 02:19:52.360]  scared day and you're gonna see the change take place yeah absolutely they
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:55.360]  got to pull a wrap out of the hat everybody's waking up to them folks have

[02:24:07.720 --> 02:24:13.520]  because there's a war on for your mind we had the roster loaded up with very
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:18.640]  informative guests today like Gerald Salente and obviously a professor Dr.
[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:23.320]  Francis Boyle and but we will pepper the rest of this hour with your calls
[02:24:23.320 --> 02:24:27.920]  John and Wyoming, Ken and Justin those will be the three calls I have time for
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:31.120]  we got more military sources actually calling in and I've done a lot of
[02:24:31.120 --> 02:24:34.680]  research on this these are very accurate callers that are calling in giving us
[02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:38.640]  info because obviously I haven't told everything I know not not all of it
[02:24:38.640 --> 02:24:43.320]  because I don't want to give away the source of the missing nuke story I get
[02:24:43.320 --> 02:24:47.200]  one more email or comment though about there aren't nukes at Dias under the
[02:24:47.200 --> 02:24:50.520]  treaty that's the whole point they pulled nukes out that weren't supposed to be
[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:54.760]  there and the base security was freaking out about it the other officers were
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:57.240]  and they had to have the base commander come out and say no this is
[02:24:57.240 --> 02:25:01.480]  authorized and they went on the trucks and the police went as far to go where
[02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:05.280]  are these going and they said South Carolina is what we're told to the
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.640]  special forces security people from Florida that were there picking them up
[02:25:09.640 --> 02:25:15.720]  okay and then we find out Lindsey Graham is running around saying South Carolina
[02:25:15.720 --> 02:25:20.360]  is gonna be nuked by Syria we don't attack them CBS News the stories up on
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:27.800]  info wars.com prisonplanet.com and I hope the two things aren't connected but
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:31.880]  you had the mine-on situation with the cruise missiles that came up missing a
[02:25:31.880 --> 02:25:34.840]  few years ago and then no one would say who gave the order and everybody
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:39.440]  involved loading them got killed committed suicide or died so this big
[02:25:39.440 --> 02:25:42.440]  deal okay and I don't like having to report this is very dangerous I'll be
[02:25:42.440 --> 02:25:45.360]  honest with you fact that I'm talking about it being dangerous may protect us
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:49.560]  a little bit but my gut tells me this is really dangerous area to be involved in
[02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:55.040]  but I you know what I am not gonna play games and it's gonna take that attitude
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:58.320]  from everybody that's gonna change things like the folks that let us know
[02:25:58.320 --> 02:26:03.800]  about this going on now Dr. Francis Boyle is obviously a guest every few
[02:26:03.800 --> 02:26:08.120]  months on the show very informative and I'm not gonna go over his old bio's
[02:26:08.120 --> 02:26:12.080]  we'll take up all the time but he has a PhD in political science from Harvard
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:16.720]  University top of his class there and he's the best-selling author as well his
[02:26:16.720 --> 02:26:20.880]  most recent book destroying Libya and the New World Order the three decades US
[02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:25.600]  campaign to terminate the Kadaqi Kadafi revolution he's an expert on Syria
[02:26:25.600 --> 02:26:29.800]  traveled the whole world he went to the special PhD only give one of a year
[02:26:29.800 --> 02:26:34.000]  people like Brzezinski and Kissinger he was being ruined one of their top guys
[02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.600]  but has been exposing him when he found out the whole plan and that's why he's
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:43.560]  on a no-fly list and is harassed and demonized he also helped write US
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:47.560]  chemical biological weapons treaties he didn't like having his horn to the
[02:26:47.560 --> 02:26:52.200]  but he's a top expert and he joins us here today only like three minutes we
[02:26:52.200 --> 02:26:55.960]  got a break long same coming up Dr. Boyle but you've heard me mention what's
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:27:00.400]  happening with these missing nukes all the other Putin saying he'll now arm
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:05.640]  Syria more Russian Chinese troopship showing up battle cruisers missile
[02:27:05.640 --> 02:27:11.400]  cruisers you look at the scary neocons with Obama really creepy people I mean
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:15.640]  my gut tells me we're in the most dangerous place historically since the
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:19.240]  Cuban Missile Crisis but instead of having John F Kennedy as president we've
[02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:23.400]  got something like Jack T Ripper in charge what is your gut and your intel
[02:27:23.400 --> 02:27:29.360]  telling you Dr. Boyle yes it is extremely dangerous Alex as you were
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:35.720]  pointing out as you know just earlier this week Israel launched a ballistic
[02:27:35.720 --> 02:27:41.920]  missile in the general direction of Russia with the support of the Pentagon
[02:27:41.920 --> 02:27:48.960]  forcing the Russians to put their nuclear forces on alert my understanding is
[02:27:48.960 --> 02:27:58.120]  they're still on alert other in bunkers that's correct and it this is shaping up
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:03.440]  like like the Cuban Missile Crisis which I live through you have the five
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:09.600]  Russian ships that have interposed themselves off the coast of Syria the
[02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:16.760]  Chinese ship is now joining them so it appears that Russia and China have
[02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:23.560]  decided to draw a red line at Syria they did sacrifice Libya but it does appear
[02:28:23.560 --> 02:28:30.960]  they they've decided to make a stand here Obama got nowhere with Putin in
[02:28:30.960 --> 02:28:40.880]  St. Petersburg so I'm afraid that if we don't stop Obama right away we could be
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:48.040]  seeing a regional war here that evolves into World War 3 if you look at the
[02:28:48.040 --> 02:28:54.560]  resolution that Obama sent to Congress it clearly calls for the
[02:28:54.560 --> 02:29:00.920]  authorization to use military force against Iran and Russia so that says
[02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:06.200]  anywhere in the world yeah basically basically but it's clear it says anyone
[02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:13.400]  that supports Syria and that means Iran that means Russia it now means China has
[02:29:13.400 --> 02:29:21.040]  Bola the the Palestinians in Gaza so basically anyone Obama decides he wants
[02:29:21.040 --> 02:29:27.040]  to take out he can take out also US our report the Wall Street Journalists say
[02:29:27.040 --> 02:29:33.120]  oh well those Russian ships are sending ill to Intel back to Syria which of
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:36.640]  course means they'll take those Russian ships out stay there doctor we'll come
[02:29:36.640 --> 02:29:41.680]  right back out at that point no one talk about Iran one of their top members of
[02:29:41.680 --> 02:29:46.520]  their expert counsel that elects the Ayatollah he's talking about how they're
[02:29:46.520 --> 02:29:50.440]  gonna rape Obama's daughter and stuff and this is really escalating quickly
[02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:59.160]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[02:32:17.800 --> 02:32:22.960]  psyche from compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing
[02:32:22.960 --> 02:32:27.280]  machine we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our
[02:32:27.280 --> 02:32:31.320]  actions when somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and
[02:32:31.320 --> 02:32:34.840]  testing it out and verifying if they can take total control of your awareness
[02:32:34.840 --> 02:32:38.400]  all of this is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game how to
[02:32:38.400 --> 02:32:42.720]  engineer the opinion of the American people so that they would not only
[02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:52.320]  endorse but demand war because there's a war on for your mind get your copy of

[02:33:21.040 --> 02:33:25.920]  get one thing straight here the people running our government our illegitimate
[02:33:25.920 --> 02:33:30.240]  and they hate America and they hate our freedom everything they say about the
[02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:35.480]  terrorists who they now publicly run in Libya in Syria in Egypt and I look at
[02:33:35.480 --> 02:33:40.760]  the strategy of tension the Brzezinski type plan and of course our guest knows
[02:33:40.760 --> 02:33:45.880]  all these people intimately and it is madness it's like Hitler turning east
[02:33:45.880 --> 02:33:51.320]  into Russia or Napoleon this is what they do when they're at the end of their
[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:56.760]  power and all their crimes are coming in you know to basically bring them down
[02:33:56.760 --> 02:34:02.440]  they will flee forward and start some giant event and you've got all of these
[02:34:02.440 --> 02:34:08.120]  scandals seven big scandals NSA fast and furious IRS gate persecuting the
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:14.480]  media the whistleblowers all of it and I see these Democratic Congress people in
[02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:19.600]  the news saying well we've got to be loyal to Obama it's so immoral that they
[02:34:19.600 --> 02:34:24.760]  Chris Matthews all these people say on TV we played the clips this week well we
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:29.360]  got to do this for Obama it's all about their club and their little their
[02:34:29.360 --> 02:34:34.120]  little almost like Hitlerian group and the neocons with them and all these
[02:34:34.120 --> 02:34:39.440]  weirdos who think war is cool and global domination and showing Assad and then
[02:34:39.440 --> 02:34:44.320]  Iran has got a bunch of unstable lunatics as well running it I mean and
[02:34:44.320 --> 02:34:49.000]  and they're saying good let the world war three begin we will kill you we're
[02:34:49.000 --> 02:34:52.560]  gonna kidnap all your families and murder you but what this happened back
[02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:56.320]  during the 80s they were grabbing CIA section chiefs killing them torturing
[02:34:56.320 --> 02:35:00.160]  them I mean look then they may not have to stage terror attacks if they attack
[02:35:00.160 --> 02:35:04.680]  Syria and Iran they do have sleeper cells and see that's the false flag start a
[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:09.080]  fight then the asymmetrical warfare comes back by groups that have no other
[02:35:09.080 --> 02:35:14.040]  way to fight back but like that you get them in a wild killing frenzy you know
[02:35:14.040 --> 02:35:20.120]  us a homicidal death commando mood that the Persians will certainly get into
[02:35:20.120 --> 02:35:24.000]  over a million of them died in that Iran Iraq or the West stage they're sick of
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:28.840]  it and they're gonna take all our rights under this this conflagration now
[02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:33.400]  I'm ranting here dr. Francis Boyle who's helped write chemical and biological
[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:37.920]  weapons treaties you know was basically trained by all these guys knows them
[02:35:37.920 --> 02:35:42.000]  well you know there's psychology but this is bigger than just a few cruise
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:47.240]  missiles to divert off the scandals I mean they're massing B1 and B2's in
[02:35:47.240 --> 02:35:52.200]  Diego Garcia out in the ocean there south of the Persian Gulf they're moving
[02:35:52.200 --> 02:35:56.240]  nukes around there got troops ships loaded with Marines that's confirmed
[02:35:56.240 --> 02:36:01.040]  they got plans for 75,000 troops they were massing troops months ago in
[02:36:01.040 --> 02:36:05.680]  Jordan and Gaza I mean they're lined up it looks like not just for a regional
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:09.960]  war but a war with Russia and is that what Homeland Security was for was to
[02:36:09.960 --> 02:36:14.680]  get ready for COG for a survivable nuke war are these people completely
[02:36:14.680 --> 02:36:20.400]  certifiably insane you know them you've worked with them tell us doctor what
[02:36:20.400 --> 02:36:27.800]  we're facing well Alex what what we're seeing now is the unfolding of a very
[02:36:27.800 --> 02:36:35.000]  elaborate war plan by the Pentagon the CIA the so-called power ministries as we
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:39.640]  used to say in the Soviet Union they know exactly what they're doing this is a
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:47.680]  chess game as they see it they hit Syria Syria responds Lebanon Israel Jordan
[02:36:47.680 --> 02:36:54.960]  culminating in Iran and then Russia when whenever we take out those ships will
[02:36:54.960 --> 02:37:01.720]  have to decide Putin will have to decide do we do we fight or do we let the five
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:08.440]  ships go not only is this this a war plan but on all war plans before they
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:12.880]  execute them and you've been pointing out the stages here these are all stages
[02:37:12.880 --> 02:37:19.120]  it's a war plan it has also been war game so they already know what these
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:25.560]  steps are and will be and from my perspective here having been through
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:30.640]  the same PhD program that produced Kissinger and Brzezinski they gave me
[02:37:30.640 --> 02:37:37.240]  Kissinger's old office I think this is it that that all this talk about you know
[02:37:37.240 --> 02:37:43.000]  hitting Iran down the line they're gonna take Iran out now and then it will be up
[02:37:43.000 --> 02:37:48.840]  to Putin to decide when they take out his five ships there off the coast of
[02:37:48.840 --> 02:37:56.120]  Syria will he fight or he won't and I don't know what Putin will do except that
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:38:04.400]  you recall during the war that during the Georgia act well of course we came
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:11.080]  very close and he did he did fight back there and we basically sacrificed
[02:38:11.080 --> 02:38:18.480]  Georgia and then we pulled back but Putin did say that this earlier he did
[02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:23.280]  mention a Cuban Missile Crisis in reverse and he did say this this could
[02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:29.320]  set off World War three remember Putin is KGB he's a very tough man a lot
[02:38:29.320 --> 02:38:36.120]  tougher than than Obama who's who's basically a frontman pretty much like
[02:38:36.120 --> 02:38:42.280]  Bush Jr. or Reagan before him they put him in there they give him the lines to
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:46.600]  read he he's very good doctor doctor let me just throw this out again I want you
[02:38:46.600 --> 02:38:49.440]  to continue on that point I'm interrupting look I understand it's all
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:52.840]  wargamed out with computers and geopolitical they admit that Wesley
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:57.120]  Clark blew the whistle on its seven nation plan I understand but still
[02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:02.200]  Hitler had plenty and stew I'm saying fundamentally these are insane people I
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:06.240]  can look at them and the way they act that group of senators and people and
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:10.280]  the National Security Council these people all have psychopathic looking
[02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:14.360]  eyes these are all people this is like they're they're fun is doing this and
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:18.400]  they've all got bunkers their grandkids have got bunkers and and and you know I
[02:39:18.400 --> 02:39:21.520]  think they all need to be arrested I mean I'm willing to risk my life saying
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:25.880]  that on air I've had enough of these people I'm not enough of their crap now
[02:39:25.880 --> 02:39:29.480]  I'm asking you about their mindset doctor because you know them yeah I went
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:34.480]  through the same program at Harvard and then at the University of Chicago with
[02:39:34.480 --> 02:39:40.600]  all the neocons there these people are psychopathic there's no question about
[02:39:40.600 --> 02:39:45.560]  it and they are brainwashed at these elite institutions like Chicago and
[02:39:45.560 --> 02:39:51.600]  Harvard to do this type of work but we have to understand you can be a
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:57.520]  psychopath and yet still be extremely rational and calculating highly
[02:39:57.520 --> 02:40:03.680]  functioning psychopath that is correct the same was true with with Bush Jr. so
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:08.120]  um you know we with all the respect Alice I don't I don't know exactly how
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:12.520]  far it gets us to say they're insane but I think the correct term is
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:17.920]  psychopathic or sociopathic either one I think is a correct isn't it insane
[02:40:17.920 --> 02:40:22.800]  risking thermonuclear war just because they will have a score to settle with
[02:40:22.800 --> 02:40:30.480]  Assad I think their calculation is that Putin will back down that they they can
[02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:37.920]  take Syria and if necessary Iran and that Putin will back down because we and
[02:40:37.920 --> 02:40:43.480]  the Chinese at the end of the day will back down because we have an offensive
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:51.040]  first strike strategic nuclear weapons capability that can take out the Russian
[02:40:51.040 --> 02:40:56.080]  nuclear forces and the Chinese forces in a first strike you're talking about
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:00.400]  cruise missiles I'm talking about the whole complex of everything we have
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:10.760]  including ICBMs SLBMs the B2s B1s B52s and don't forget the secret projects we
[02:41:10.760 --> 02:41:15.920]  that is correct but I this has already been written about in foreign affairs and
[02:41:15.920 --> 02:41:20.440]  things of that that we do have the K and I've written an article about it if you
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:26.000]  want to see on the internet and Obama has approved a first strike strategic
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:31.080]  nuclear war plan against Russia yeah I saw that article give us the name we'll
[02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:36.400]  pull it up on screen for TV viewers Dr. Moil well it's just Obama plans first
[02:41:36.400 --> 02:41:40.960]  strike nuclear war if you hit my name it should come out Dr. Francis Boyle
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:44.560]  Obama plans first strike nuclear war yeah I mean they've admitted that first
[02:41:44.560 --> 02:41:49.320]  strike a few years ago and that's I mean it's just it's crazy because it's
[02:41:49.320 --> 02:41:53.400]  certain at a certain point it's got a gift you've got all these control freaks
[02:41:53.400 --> 02:41:58.080]  building giant NSA bases setting up domestic takeover groups how do the
[02:41:58.080 --> 02:42:02.920]  American people play in when you've got 99% Congress is now saying in phone
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:08.080]  calls it's actually 520 something to four is what's coming in on the phone
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:13.080]  calls on average so it's more than 99% I think it's like 99.5 or something if you
[02:42:13.080 --> 02:42:18.920]  do the math we did it last night in an article I mean I see the facade though on
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:23.360]  government falling everyone I know now is apologizing to me and saying it's all
[02:42:23.360 --> 02:42:27.320]  true I'm not just saying that I mean it's like everyone I know now it's like a
[02:42:27.320 --> 02:42:30.800]  mass is that a survival instinct do you think and how big do you think the
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:35.000]  awakening is and does that matter or is that even more of a reason to get a big
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:39.880]  war going to try to shut down the awakening well as you know I I started
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:46.400]  in a basement campaign against Obama and it's it's really last week I launched
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:51.480]  it and it's really taking off and I've heard from a lot of people and I think
[02:42:51.480 --> 02:42:58.240]  the scales are falling from their eyes on on Obama that's correct but you know
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:05.160]  still our members of Congress will respond to public pressure notice Senator
[02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:12.160]  McCain the tongue lashing he got there at a town forum and now he's saying if
[02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:18.960]  if Obama puts boots on the ground in Syria he'll be impeached the New York
[02:43:18.960 --> 02:43:26.080]  Times today said Obama fears impeachment so I think what we have to do is put
[02:43:26.080 --> 02:43:30.280]  the fear of impeachment into Obama immediately what about the people
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:33.920]  advising him they're the people that once this all flushes out I want hearings
[02:43:33.920 --> 02:43:38.000]  I want to start arresting these people because what Wesley Clark talks about a
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.600]  plan to hit seven nations that didn't do anything that's a war crime that's
[02:43:42.600 --> 02:43:48.640]  correct and in my Libya book I point out I cite General Clark's memoirs and I
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:55.800]  compare it to the Nuremberg judgment where Nuremberg condemned the Nazis for
[02:43:55.800 --> 02:44:01.920]  waging offensive war against 12 states and Obama the Clark plan had seven and
[02:44:01.920 --> 02:44:08.360]  then you have to head in there Yemen and Pakistan so the Obama people are
[02:44:08.360 --> 02:44:12.960]  already at 9 or 10 depending on how you want to count it that's correct and by
[02:44:12.960 --> 02:44:16.440]  the way folks I don't like getting up here saying people usually talk like
[02:44:16.440 --> 02:44:19.720]  this saying arrest these people I love my kids and I love the future of
[02:44:19.720 --> 02:44:24.000]  humanity and I'm telling you I've studied history even if Russia backs down
[02:44:24.000 --> 02:44:28.360]  this time or later well the type of world they're building will end up being
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:32.680]  in some giant chemical or biological or nuclear war and and these guys think
[02:44:32.680 --> 02:44:35.560]  they're gonna survive it the whole infrastructure they're building is so
[02:44:35.560 --> 02:44:39.280]  they can have global domination we shouldn't give in to the mental illness
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:43.120]  of global domination of these megalomaniacs let's play one of the
[02:44:43.120 --> 02:44:46.760]  clips of Wesley Clark the former head general of NATO who was brought into the
[02:44:46.760 --> 02:44:51.000]  Pentagon with the plan to invade seven countries here it is I went through the
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:55.160]  Pentagon ten days after 9-11 and an officer from the joint staff called me
[02:44:55.160 --> 02:44:58.640]  into his office and said I want you to know he said sir we're gonna attack
[02:44:58.640 --> 02:45:06.120]  Iraq and I said why he said we don't know and then I came back to the Pentagon
[02:45:06.120 --> 02:45:10.520]  about six weeks later I saw the same officer I said why why haven't we attacked
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:13.920]  Iraq we still gonna attack Iraq he said oh sir he says it's worse than that I
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:16.560]  just got this memo from the Secretary of Defense's office it says we're gonna
[02:45:16.560 --> 02:45:22.000]  attack and destroy the governments in seven countries in five years we're
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:26.480]  gonna start with Iraq and then we're gonna move to Syria Lebanon Libya Somalia
[02:45:26.480 --> 02:45:34.960]  Sudan and Iran and ladies and gentlemen this is not a video game Dr. Boyle
[02:45:34.960 --> 02:45:40.800]  that's correct as a matter of fact right after 9-11 Deputy Secretary of Defense
[02:45:40.800 --> 02:45:45.840]  Wolfowitz came out and said the United States government was going to get in
[02:45:45.840 --> 02:45:50.000]  the business of destroying states that was his exact words destroying states
[02:45:50.000 --> 02:45:56.560]  and that plan was that the General Clark discussed was drawn up pursuant to
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:46:01.920]  this picked up by Wolfowitz and I went through the same Neil Kahn program at
[02:46:01.920 --> 02:46:07.840]  Harvard that sorry at Chicago that that produced Wolfowitz he got his PhD in
[02:46:07.840 --> 02:46:12.440]  international relations there while I got my bachelor's degree in international
[02:46:12.440 --> 02:46:16.280]  relations it's it's Neil Kahn heaven up there and they teach you that being more
[02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:20.320]  evil than evil is actually virtuous that command destruction that you are the
[02:46:20.320 --> 02:46:24.920]  enlightened one everyone else's dogs basically correct well it's even worse
[02:46:24.920 --> 02:46:34.840]  than that and that the godfather for the Neil Kahn's was Carl Schmidt who was the
[02:46:34.840 --> 02:46:41.920]  leading Nazi jurist of that era he justified every hideous atrocity that
[02:46:41.920 --> 02:46:49.280]  Hitler inflicted on everyone including the Jews his student and protege was Leo
[02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:55.160]  Strauss right who founded the Neil Kahn movement at Chicago I arrived there
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:47:00.520]  right after Strauss had retired but I studied with his top student right and
[02:47:00.520 --> 02:47:07.720]  man Joseph Cropsey but Wolfowitz had arrived to to study with Strauss and
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:13.040]  the whole Neil Kahn cabal there at at Chicago so I have to understand
[02:47:13.040 --> 02:47:18.680]  certainly in the Neil Kahn's this is a neo-nazism I noticed I noticed Cass
[02:47:18.680 --> 02:47:24.180]  Sunstein has a similar pedigree as you but you didn't go you know serve the
[02:47:24.180 --> 02:47:28.600]  emperor after you got trained by him so so understanding this of course he's
[02:47:28.600 --> 02:47:32.240]  saying play us off against each other total war on the people I just can't
[02:47:32.240 --> 02:47:36.280]  believe they publish all this stuff they do publish it which is good you can
[02:47:36.280 --> 02:47:41.440]  read about the plan so Sunstein is a is a closet Neil Kahn spent most of his
[02:47:41.440 --> 02:47:47.760]  career at the University of Chicago and then we're at where well well I start
[02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:51.800]  out though well he's a student at Harvard yeah he taught at Chicago very
[02:47:51.800 --> 02:47:57.240]  met Obama and Elena Kagan now in the Supreme Court to make a long story
[02:47:57.240 --> 02:48:01.880]  short Kagan licked the boots of Larry Summers to become president of Harvard
[02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:08.480]  Harvard sorry of Dean of Harvard Law School and then she hired Sunstein we
[02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:13.880]  know for a fact as I'm sure you documented Sunstein is in charge of was
[02:48:13.880 --> 02:48:20.280]  in charge of Obama's Internet infiltration policy cognitive infiltration
[02:48:20.280 --> 02:48:26.380]  that's right and his wife is Samantha Power at the Security Council
[02:48:26.380 --> 02:48:32.320]  fair mongering war mongering yeah she's a war whore these people are they're
[02:48:32.320 --> 02:48:35.240]  incalculably evil is what I hope listen understand we're gonna go back to calls
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:40.160]  here in a moment but I sure and I want your take on what these callers have to
[02:48:40.160 --> 02:48:44.800]  say have you heard about my report about missing nukes from an Air Force base
[02:48:44.800 --> 02:48:50.440]  and then now Lindsey Graham says support war or the west coast is going to be
[02:48:50.440 --> 02:48:56.960]  nuked well yes it does remind me of the point Cheney made as vice president
[02:48:56.960 --> 02:49:01.800]  that the next major terrorist act that goes off we're gonna blame it on Iran
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:08.560]  and and go to Iran so yes there is a potential of a false flag here sure I
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:12.680]  just can't believe it's all happening but I guess for every generation that
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:15.400]  goes through a real tyranny it's like they help people always say like we
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:19.720]  couldn't believe it was happening and I thought I'm in slow motion here like
[02:49:19.720 --> 02:49:22.840]  when you're in a car wreck right before the other car hits you is there any way
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:29.360]  to stop these people well two points one you know we September 9th Congress
[02:49:29.360 --> 02:49:35.960]  reconvenes and we need a member of the house to immediately put in a bill of
[02:49:35.960 --> 02:49:41.800]  impeachment against Obama the house is controlled by the Republicans they
[02:49:41.800 --> 02:49:47.800]  impeach Clinton over Felicia and lying about Felicia they could certainly
[02:49:47.800 --> 02:49:53.280]  impeach Obama immediately without hearings in fact it can all be done
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:59.400]  orally and on a voice vote that would then send it off to a Senate for a trial
[02:49:59.400 --> 02:50:05.520]  that would bottle up hopefully Obama indeed today's New York Times says Obama
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:11.160]  does not want to get impeached because it would bottle him up in in the Senate
[02:50:11.160 --> 02:50:16.800]  and then second we all still have our First Amendment rights freedom of the
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:20.280]  speech freedom of association well I mean as a top constitutional lawyer I
[02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:24.960]  should have added that to your long repertoire if the Justice Department's
[02:50:24.960 --> 02:50:28.800]  run by him does the Congress then also impeach his attorney general and then
[02:50:28.800 --> 02:50:33.280]  and then or do we have a state grand jury and dieting I mean how do we arrest
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:37.760]  these people well I've already taken a position a year ago that holders should
[02:50:37.760 --> 02:50:43.800]  have been impeached for publicly advocating and approving the murder of
[02:50:43.800 --> 02:50:48.760]  the United States citizens in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United
[02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:52.480]  States sure sure backing NDAA stay there and explain to us the constitutional

[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:10.960]  big councils go and they create false pretenses and then launch wars by
[02:54:10.960 --> 02:54:15.120]  committees so one person can't get in trouble and be blamed Obama got cold
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:19.000]  feet and then went to Congress to get them to certify it but now that's
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:23.040]  blowing up in his face I don't get up here on air with a sizable audience of
[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:26.160]  three million and say they should be arrested for nothing I mean they could
[02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:30.360]  kill me or arrest me or set me up very easily if they do that's a price I pay
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:36.400]  because I don't want nuclear war to happen okay I'm a serious person and I
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:40.440]  know Dr. Boyle is a serious person we're not trying to sit here and like hype
[02:54:40.440 --> 02:54:45.240]  this up there's no way to hype how serious this is with Vladimir Putin
[02:54:45.240 --> 02:54:49.880]  talking about nuclear war okay and if you study criminology in the past
[02:54:49.880 --> 02:54:54.040]  elites this you know I'm surprised we haven't killed ourselves so far and
[02:54:54.040 --> 02:54:57.240]  Dr. Boyle just briefly then we're gonna let you go and go to calls I appreciate
[02:54:57.240 --> 02:55:01.960]  all your time what is the path obviously I think impeachment threats are
[02:55:01.960 --> 02:55:05.840]  important the Congress is backing off they're getting scared Obama came out
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:10.640]  today and said I'll go ahead anyway so he's obviously being told to do this
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:15.720]  what do we do then when these people are trying to start aggressive illegal
[02:55:15.720 --> 02:55:22.280]  hitlerian war well first on Obama you know on all these people we we have to
[02:55:22.280 --> 02:55:28.120]  impeach certainly Obama and Holder would be good too and get them out of
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:33.080]  office and then we can worry about prosecuting and they're also citizens
[02:55:33.080 --> 02:55:41.560]  arrests you could check with a local attorney in your jurisdiction about the
[02:55:41.560 --> 02:55:48.240]  common law doctrine of citizen arrests to see if that is available and what the
[02:55:48.240 --> 02:55:52.360]  circumstances might now I know that's in law but they make a joke out of it but
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:55.400]  but I mean then they just call you a terrorist but I guess it would be a
[02:55:55.400 --> 02:56:01.320]  good PR stunt at least why under the circumstances it might be something to
[02:56:01.320 --> 02:56:07.160]  consider but I'm not advocating anyone to do this unless you seek advice and
[02:56:07.160 --> 02:56:12.840]  counsel from a local attorney familiar with either the common law or
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:20.600]  statutory law in your jurisdiction and then third we need massive numbers of
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:27.960]  American citizens to take to the streets peaceful nonviolent protests against a
[02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:34.400]  war we need Democrats and Republicans liberals libertarians conservatives
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:38.600]  I agree why do you think we have such an incredible unification of even Glenn
[02:56:38.600 --> 02:56:42.720]  Beck saying we should demonstrate and Rush Limbaugh saying looks like a false
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:47.160]  flag and Pat Buchanan and Matt Drudge and Ron Paul I mean it's across the
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:52.440]  spectrum people understand this is really dangerous that's correct I live
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:57.640]  through the Cuban Missile Crisis and that's what spurred me to study
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:04.360]  international relations I I had grown up to believe Kennedy was a good president
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:10.360]  and when the crisis well over I thought you know he's insane and I could do a
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:16.600]  better job than this but I better study it so I think we're now seeing the
[02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:23.560]  Obama Emperor wears no clothes and all of his associates and how dangerous and
[02:57:23.560 --> 02:57:28.880]  sociopathic these people really are to the entire world and especially here in
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:36.120]  America to our Constitution our Republic indeed Obama is worse than Bush not
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:41.240]  only did he do all the police state practices but as you were mentioning
[02:57:41.240 --> 02:57:48.520]  before the NDA a senator Levin told us that it was Obama himself oh yeah
[02:57:48.520 --> 02:57:54.160]  sister that the that it applied Dr. Boyle briefly what's your assessment of Putin
[02:57:54.160 --> 02:58:01.880]  Putin's a very tough man he is he is KGB to the core he's a lot tougher than
[02:58:01.880 --> 02:58:08.880]  Obama so I don't know if he's going to back down if we take out those Soviet
[02:58:08.880 --> 02:58:14.240]  ship the sorry those Russian ships I don't know if he's going to back down I
[02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:19.600]  can't say I think it's a mistake I'm a part of these Obama police people to
[02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:25.600]  believe he does but but remember Obama's top advisor on this is Brzezinski
[02:58:25.600 --> 02:58:31.600]  and he's a certified sociopath I went to the same program at Harvard that
[02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:35.440]  produced incredible I know Dr. Boyle will talk to you again soon next week if
[02:58:35.440 --> 02:58:38.680]  you can do it I'll be back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. coming up well with more phone
[02:58:38.680 --> 02:58:44.160]  calls straight ahead thank you Dr. Boyle folks pray for peace thank you sir folks
[02:58:44.160 --> 02:58:48.520]  now's the time to pray I'm telling you now is the time to pray and call

[03:00:27.320 --> 03:00:31.120]  can no disrespect and have something on hold for over an hour all this much
[03:00:31.120 --> 03:00:37.080]  overdrive as it takes before we go to Ken, Justin, Tyler, John, JC and others
[03:00:37.080 --> 03:00:41.960]  let's go to John and then it's Ken up next John is in Wyoming retired nuke
[03:00:41.960 --> 03:00:47.080]  sub individual in the Navy what is your take on on the report I have that's that
[03:00:47.080 --> 03:00:52.440]  is accurate this is a real source that the nukes they know we're on the base
[03:00:52.440 --> 03:00:56.200]  were brought out put on trucks by Special Forces Army and Air Force Base
[03:00:56.200 --> 03:01:00.400]  Dias and shipped out to South Carolina what's your take on that and then Graham
[03:01:00.400 --> 03:01:05.280]  saying brace for nuclear attack in South Carolina well Alex first of all
[03:01:05.280 --> 03:01:09.760]  having served in the submarine service during the Vietnam War I can tell you
[03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:14.600]  that Charleston for about a half a century has been a major home port for
[03:01:14.600 --> 03:01:19.840]  our East Coast Fleet ballistic missile submarines that's where they're home
[03:01:19.840 --> 03:01:24.520]  ported for the Atlantic Fleet is Charleston South Carolina and just
[03:01:24.520 --> 03:01:29.400]  remember to you go back to the comments that well there weren't supposed to be
[03:01:29.400 --> 03:01:33.560]  nukes at Dias well we weren't supposed to have nukes on our boat I was on the
[03:01:33.560 --> 03:01:40.000]  Greenfish SS 351 which was an old diesel electric fast attack submarine that was
[03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:47.080]  built in 1946 and we had a mark 45 nuclear warhead torpedo in the after
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:52.400]  torpedo room just below my bunk that was supposed to be used only on orders from
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:58.400]  the president to take out not an enemy ship but an enemy fleet you hit the the
[03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:03.960]  main ship there in the fleet like a let's say a battleship or a an aircraft
[03:02:03.960 --> 03:02:08.080]  carrier and you take out that and all of the surrounding escort vessels around
[03:02:08.080 --> 03:02:13.640]  it so they have since replaced those with mark 48 nuclear warhead torpedoes
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:18.280]  which many of our submarines carry now our newer submarines since the Thresher
[03:02:18.280 --> 03:02:23.280]  class do not have after torpedo rooms they have torpedo rooms that were a
[03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:28.000]  midships that only fire forward because of their more streamlined hull design
[03:02:28.000 --> 03:02:33.520]  they don't have after torpedo rooms but there is a reason why they want to pick
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:38.200]  Charleston look at World War two just before Pearl Harbor was attacked a day
[03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:42.800]  and a half before all of the carriers that were really the number one target
[03:02:42.800 --> 03:02:49.000]  out to sea we're sent out to see south of Pearl Harbor away from the oncoming
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:56.040]  Japanese fleet and so bingo that's what happened so they're being set up now at
[03:02:56.040 --> 03:03:00.960]  Charleston and like you said earlier in the show if Lindsey Graham knows we're
[03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:04.600]  gonna get nuked at Charleston you need to ask him how the heck do you know
[03:03:04.600 --> 03:03:10.320]  fella where did you get that information because you didn't find it in the local
[03:03:10.320 --> 03:03:15.680]  comics in the Sunday paper so where did you get that information well sir John
[03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:19.520]  you're an amazing asset to give us info because everything you're saying checking
[03:03:19.520 --> 03:03:22.520]  out when we know they still have covert nukes there that's come out you've heard
[03:03:22.520 --> 03:03:26.680]  the callers but absolutely that's an old base still a lot of stuff going on there
[03:03:26.680 --> 03:03:31.400]  imagine though I have this source who is freaked out didn't know nukes were there
[03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:36.200]  sees this go on there's no paperwork they remember the North Dakota debacle
[03:03:36.200 --> 03:03:41.640]  from six years ago and they call us we talk about it and then Graham it turns
[03:03:41.640 --> 03:03:46.120]  out the same day saying we're gonna be nuked CBS news but then it doesn't get
[03:03:46.120 --> 03:03:51.680]  any coverage I mean this is bizarre and I hope the two aren't connected but what
[03:03:51.680 --> 03:03:55.720]  would be the strategy to bomb why would the globalist bomb their own navy base
[03:03:55.720 --> 03:04:00.680]  and then and then try to blame it on Syria you think they hit a target that
[03:04:00.680 --> 03:04:04.320]  didn't matter unless maybe they're double crossing and the globalist are
[03:04:04.320 --> 03:04:08.240]  really Chinese agents or something and and they've got some plan to take
[03:04:08.240 --> 03:04:12.200]  America out you know that could be a plan to I'm telling you this is I this is
[03:04:12.200 --> 03:04:16.840]  some complex stuff there are two reasons why they want to take out
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:22.280]  Charles the number one to inflict maximum damage because it is a major naval
[03:04:22.280 --> 03:04:27.880]  base there not just for the FBMs but also fast-attack nuclear submarines also
[03:04:27.880 --> 03:04:32.600]  fleet ballistic missile submarines are what we need in the event that we do go
[03:04:32.600 --> 03:04:37.640]  into a full-scale world war three because they're the best nuclear
[03:04:37.640 --> 03:04:42.560]  retaliatory capability that we have because unlike fixed missile sites which
[03:04:42.560 --> 03:04:48.000]  can be targeted by GPS by the Russians or the Chinese or the North Koreans these
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:52.560]  things are the fleet ballistic missiles stay there sir I'm gonna come back give you a final comment don't hang up John
[03:04:52.560 --> 03:04:56.480]  then we're gonna go to Ken Justin Tyler and JC get to all of you I want you to
[03:04:56.480 --> 03:05:02.560]  finish your point about what you think's going on here why does the United
[03:05:02.560 --> 03:05:06.680]  States spend the largest percentage of GDP in the world on health care why do
[03:05:06.680 --> 03:05:11.120]  we have the highest cancer rates on the planet the highest rates of diabetes
[03:05:11.120 --> 03:05:17.800]  autism and every other major disease it all comes down to one thing we are what

[03:08:04.080 --> 03:08:11.080]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[03:08:18.480 --> 03:08:24.480]  Dr. Bob Bowman the former head of the Star Wars program Vietnam fighter
[03:08:24.480 --> 03:08:28.560]  bomber pilot flew over a hundred missions nuclear physicist chemical
[03:08:28.560 --> 03:08:35.040]  engineer you name it just a real genius top of his engineering class he was
[03:08:35.040 --> 03:08:38.480]  the head of the Star Wars program when it was still secret and he said behind
[03:08:38.480 --> 03:08:41.760]  closed doors but he could only tell me this because it had been leaked by
[03:08:41.760 --> 03:08:47.560]  accident on C-Span and a debate he'd had in the 80s about how STI was really
[03:08:47.560 --> 03:08:54.040]  offensive that by 78 they had squadrons of basically what's known as black
[03:08:54.040 --> 03:09:03.000]  manna radio-controlled drones with DU shabos in them meteor guns I mean
[03:09:03.000 --> 03:09:08.920]  there's no atomic bomb hydrogen bomb in there no neutron bomb you know the
[03:09:08.920 --> 03:09:14.640]  plane's going already 25,000 miles an hour around the earth and it get and as
[03:09:14.640 --> 03:09:20.400]  it comes in with a trajectory it drops the DU that has the little rocket on the
[03:09:20.400 --> 03:09:26.120]  back that angles it in and then it goes up to 38,000 miles an hour and has the
[03:09:26.120 --> 03:09:31.320]  effect of a multi-megaton nuke on whatever it hits did and just from the
[03:09:31.320 --> 03:09:38.080]  kinetic energy now folks that's the 1970s and that's why these people are so
[03:09:38.080 --> 03:09:41.040]  arrogant but they're not Americans they're globalists they're there they're
[03:09:41.040 --> 03:09:45.440]  UN world government you know they're God they're the technocrats they've got all
[03:09:45.440 --> 03:09:49.920]  the answers and now they want to start a war with Russia and I don't romanticize
[03:09:49.920 --> 03:09:53.720]  Russia never been to Russia here it's incredibly corrupt here it has you know
[03:09:53.720 --> 03:09:57.680]  beautiful women beautiful art but super corrupt I don't want to go over there
[03:09:57.680 --> 03:10:01.200]  okay I'm not with Russia but it's not Russia doing all this to me it's not
[03:10:01.200 --> 03:10:04.920]  Syria it's the globalist and I'm sick of them in their shadow government I'm
[03:10:04.920 --> 03:10:10.280]  gonna get to everybody now fast but John bottom line you were in diesel fast
[03:10:10.280 --> 03:10:13.880]  attack subs that had nukes in them that's admitted that they've got probably
[03:10:13.880 --> 03:10:17.720]  five times the nukes they say they've got there's all sorts of secret missile
[03:10:17.720 --> 03:10:21.360]  silos all over the place they're always getting found by hikers and people I
[03:10:21.360 --> 03:10:24.360]  mean we know the Russians are the same the Chinese are the same all these
[03:10:24.360 --> 03:10:29.040]  treaties mean absolutely nothing bottom line why would they want to sneak
[03:10:29.040 --> 03:10:37.640]  nuke warheads out of West Texas into the Carolinas and and why wouldn't they
[03:10:37.640 --> 03:10:42.120]  have proper paperwork what do you think the missing cruise missiles in 2007
[03:10:42.120 --> 03:10:47.880]  from my not were about I mean what is your gut tells you is going on here it
[03:10:47.880 --> 03:10:51.920]  tells me that this is a false flag operation a major false flag that's
[03:10:51.920 --> 03:10:55.960]  about to occur because remember too if they take out our naval base in
[03:10:55.960 --> 03:11:00.080]  Charleston they will cripple about one-third of our fleet ballistic missile
[03:11:00.080 --> 03:11:04.480]  submarine force which is the best retaliatory force that we have in case
[03:11:04.480 --> 03:11:09.120]  of a first strike nuclear attack against the US and that's what they want to do
[03:11:09.120 --> 03:11:14.680]  the globalist want to inflict a maximum amount of damage to ourselves and to our
[03:11:14.680 --> 03:11:18.520]  ability to retaliate against any kind of an attack and then they've given the
[03:11:18.520 --> 03:11:22.760]  Panama Canal to the Chinese Communist and they've and that's why they want
[03:11:22.760 --> 03:11:27.400]  America to look so bad that's what I've been thinking is that everything they're
[03:11:27.400 --> 03:11:32.920]  doing is like trying to set America up Chinese are now building a new canal
[03:11:32.920 --> 03:11:37.080]  through Nicaragua that's just got to be much much larger than the Panama Canal
[03:11:37.080 --> 03:11:42.040]  but also I've known four different men in the submarine service who in the 60s
[03:11:42.040 --> 03:11:47.400]  were in international waters when their subs were depth charged by Russian
[03:11:47.400 --> 03:11:53.040]  destroyers in international waters and yet the Navy never talks about it but I
[03:11:53.040 --> 03:11:57.480]  shredded a number of documents to that had all kinds of fascinating information
[03:11:57.480 --> 03:12:04.440]  for instance the Scorpion by the way when it went down SSN 589 and May 28th of
[03:12:04.440 --> 03:12:10.520]  68 went down because of a Russian torpedo launched by a K-825 attack helicopter
[03:12:10.520 --> 03:12:15.280]  that's available in the book all hands down by Kenneth Sewell which was
[03:12:15.280 --> 03:12:19.760]  published in 2008 and now I've heard it's already been discontinued because it
[03:12:19.760 --> 03:12:24.360]  revealed too much information but Sewell interviewed a number of retired Russian
[03:12:24.360 --> 03:12:27.800]  admirals and generals and they deliberately attacked and killed the
[03:12:27.800 --> 03:12:35.120]  99 men aboard the Scorpion in May 28th of 68 because of a perceived incident that
[03:12:35.120 --> 03:12:39.800]  happened to them in the Sea of Japan with let me ask you this question then why
[03:12:39.800 --> 03:12:44.760]  do you think there why do you see you think maybe Obama is like a triple agent
[03:12:44.760 --> 03:12:48.080]  of the globalist we know that and that they're maneuvering America towards a
[03:12:48.080 --> 03:12:51.760]  setup to destroy us and that and that Homeland Security would then detonate
[03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:56.000]  nukes at all our bases as an inside sneak attack not even for Russia but for
[03:12:56.000 --> 03:13:00.800]  the banksters well that's exactly what's happening because again they're
[03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:05.280]  creating the problem the crisis problem just like Hitler when he set fire to
[03:13:05.280 --> 03:13:11.760]  the Reichstag and February 27th of 1933 and then five days later on March 4th he
[03:13:11.760 --> 03:13:15.520]  told the Reichstag when it reconvene in the Kroloper theater look you've got to
[03:13:15.520 --> 03:13:19.560]  help me fight this terrorism but my hands are bound by the Constitution you
[03:13:19.560 --> 03:13:24.520]  need to loosen these binds so I can give you law and order so March 23rd of 33
[03:13:24.520 --> 03:13:29.360]  the Reichstag past the enabling act which then gave Hitler dictatorial power
[03:13:29.360 --> 03:13:34.280]  by decree so that was the birth of the modern-day police state but you have to
[03:13:34.280 --> 03:13:39.280]  remember to the Russians do not back down if anyone think it thinks that
[03:13:39.280 --> 03:13:44.720]  Putin is going to wimp out on this they are in for a very rude awakening because
[03:13:44.720 --> 03:13:49.040]  Putin is not going to monkey around on this he's not going to allow his soldiers
[03:13:49.040 --> 03:13:54.960]  and his sailors to be eviscerated without any kind of a serious retaliation on
[03:13:54.960 --> 03:14:01.760]  his part hey anybody ever told you you could do audio book voiceovers this
[03:14:01.760 --> 03:14:06.000]  guy's got a great voice doesn't he well I've worked in broadcasting before Alex
[03:14:06.000 --> 03:14:10.560]  but the problem is in a little hick town like shared in Wyoming where I'm living
[03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:17.160]  you've got a one of those knucklehead rhinos who owns give us your name and
[03:14:17.160 --> 03:14:22.000]  number I want you to do some voiceover work for us because John bound pointed
[03:14:22.000 --> 03:14:27.720]  out during the break he said I'm listening to James Wesley Rawls audio book
[03:14:27.720 --> 03:14:31.000]  on how to survive a nuclear war he says it sounds just like this guy hey give
[03:14:31.000 --> 03:14:34.080]  us your name and number man I'd like to use you down the road to do some voice
[03:14:34.080 --> 03:14:37.280] overs for us God bless you I stay there John give us your name and number if you
[03:14:37.280 --> 03:14:41.680]  want to kind of be put in the computer for somebody we might use down the road
[03:14:41.680 --> 03:14:45.600]  if we need some voiceover talent okay buddy thank you you bet you tell that
[03:14:45.600 --> 03:14:49.280]  guy's got a great radio voice doesn't he sounds like like a John Wayne narrator
[03:14:49.280 --> 03:14:54.840]  or something listening to it anyways let's go back to calls here Ken says
[03:14:54.840 --> 03:14:59.360]  he's not military but says he has info on the news give us your breakdown Ken
[03:14:59.360 --> 03:15:03.200]  thanks for holding I'm the Christian minister in Georgetown South Carolina
[03:15:03.200 --> 03:15:09.560]  they called a while back yes sir go ahead okay and I wanted to fall up I want
[03:15:09.560 --> 03:15:13.280]  them to know I want public to know that if the integrator makes good on his
[03:15:13.280 --> 03:15:20.200]  threat to new Charleston South Carolina it is both flag because Charleston South
[03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:26.480]  Carolina is not a viable terrorist target a qui bono the Russians and the
[03:15:26.480 --> 03:15:30.200]  Chinese benefit from attacking I was so glad that John called in and shared all
[03:15:30.200 --> 03:15:34.360]  that technical information on the sub bases here we don't have surface fleet
[03:15:34.360 --> 03:15:38.280]  bases in Charleston they were decommissioned my friends they're working
[03:15:38.280 --> 03:15:42.080]  construction that worked there confer or claimed the claim to this day there's
[03:15:42.080 --> 03:15:46.160]  still new to the decommissioned base that's considered a possible FEMA camp
[03:15:46.160 --> 03:15:52.760]  or internment camp in Charleston and the we have as he pointed out the subtly the
[03:15:52.760 --> 03:15:58.240]  naval weapon station north of Charleston but both of those facilities are well
[03:15:58.240 --> 03:16:03.520]  guarded if we had a viable threat on South Carolina right now why have we in
[03:16:03.520 --> 03:16:08.120]  the state guard not been activated why is the Coast Guard and the Navy bases put
[03:16:08.120 --> 03:16:13.160]  on high alert and in a defensive mode and and how in the world would that
[03:16:13.160 --> 03:16:18.560]  benefit Syria Alex this thing the dots are getting so close on this it looks
[03:16:18.560 --> 03:16:24.520]  more like a paint by color than a connect the dots book I know I know and
[03:16:24.520 --> 03:16:28.320]  you know be we had one guy calling ago I think it's a hoax they're not supposed
[03:16:28.320 --> 03:16:31.760]  to have nukes at that base that's the whole point is that there weren't
[03:16:31.760 --> 03:16:35.360]  supposed to be nukes and then they pulled them out and I know this is real I
[03:16:35.360 --> 03:16:40.480]  know this went on I'm freaked out I don't just make stuff up people know
[03:16:40.480 --> 03:16:44.960]  that time and time again when I talk about comes out later and and then and
[03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:47.880]  then Graham's running around saying South Carolina is going to be nuked or
[03:16:47.880 --> 03:16:53.520]  New York don't forget or New York he says in the CBS piece that the quote
[03:16:53.520 --> 03:16:58.120]  seemed and it's just super creepy and maybe it's not connected but you've got
[03:16:58.120 --> 03:17:02.920]  all this stuff going on and I just wish to God that this wasn't happening I
[03:17:02.920 --> 03:17:08.640]  mean I I appreciate your call sir God bless you can let's go ahead and talk
[03:17:08.640 --> 03:17:14.040]  to let's talk to Justin who just got out of the Air Force and has some points on
[03:17:14.040 --> 03:17:17.120]  this what do you think from hearing about this mystery because I don't know
[03:17:17.120 --> 03:17:22.280]  what's going on what is your more informed take on this well Alex thanks
[03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:26.960]  for taking my phone call I have a really unique insight in reference to the
[03:17:26.960 --> 03:17:32.240]  nuclear incident happening 2007 with my not the Park still I am an air traffic
[03:17:32.240 --> 03:17:35.480]  controller in the Air Force at the time I was working at tower when the aircraft
[03:17:35.480 --> 03:17:39.920]  landed we're unaware there was any warheads above the aircraft at that
[03:17:39.920 --> 03:17:44.480]  time so the way things work when aircraft land you know they attach it in
[03:17:44.480 --> 03:17:49.160]  and dummy warheads on there okay aircraft when they fly with weapons of
[03:17:49.160 --> 03:17:53.520]  that nature have to be documented and we have to have certain to carry protocols
[03:17:53.520 --> 03:17:57.440]  in place we have to sterilize the airspace which is called a TFR or a
[03:17:57.440 --> 03:18:01.240]  terminal flight restriction sure you got to put the commandos out there with
[03:18:01.240 --> 03:18:06.000]  the weapons case somebody tries to steal it exactly so you have these kind of
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:09.800]  protocols in place all the time when we do this kind of operation here's the
[03:18:09.800 --> 03:18:13.720]  scary thing for those that don't know when nukes land on aircraft carriers they
[03:18:13.720 --> 03:18:18.240]  don't even let the regular seaman around it they've got Navy seals and stuff
[03:18:18.240 --> 03:18:23.040]  guarding them go ahead yeah absolutely it's a straight military convoy it is
[03:18:23.040 --> 03:18:28.080]  it is serious stuff so what makes it so unique is the aircraft lands tax is no
[03:18:28.080 --> 03:18:33.400]  problem right a regular airman who's not part of the the ammo troop but it comes
[03:18:33.400 --> 03:18:39.600]  up inspects the dummy warheads finds out the real not documented and here's
[03:18:39.600 --> 03:18:42.840]  the weird thing that makes it so unique that makes me really worried about the
[03:18:42.840 --> 03:18:45.920]  dice and you're talking about right now is this right here so later that night I
[03:18:45.920 --> 03:18:50.360]  go I go I leave work I go hang out with some friends or ammo guys a buddy of mine
[03:18:50.360 --> 03:18:54.920]  tells me that that incident happened today and I'm like are you kidding me
[03:18:54.920 --> 03:18:58.520]  they can't push me all hush hush in house a few days later it gets leaked by
[03:18:58.520 --> 03:19:02.200]  whistleblower a part of the air crew leaked it to the media that these
[03:19:02.200 --> 03:19:07.400]  missiles all these warheads get flown on a B-52 bomber all the way down to
[03:19:07.400 --> 03:19:11.360]  barks to the airport space and nobody knows anything about it and then you
[03:19:11.360 --> 03:19:14.760]  talk about dais which is supposed to be non-nuclear and then the same incident
[03:19:14.760 --> 03:19:18.040]  happening right now with no paper trail and what's going on in the Middle East
[03:19:18.040 --> 03:19:22.480]  and Syria and and Graham talking about a possibility of Charleston being attacked
[03:19:22.480 --> 03:19:27.200]  it's just this gets my goosebumps off the back of my hair I hear you buddy
[03:19:27.200 --> 03:19:32.080]  believe me I'm doing it very very scary stuff because I got first-hand knowledge
[03:19:32.080 --> 03:19:37.920]  of the company in 2007 and now I'm seeing it happen again six years later and I'm
[03:19:37.920 --> 03:19:41.840]  a little bit afraid I'm afraid for the country right now I'm absolutely I so
[03:19:41.840 --> 03:19:48.240]  were you in the Dakotas or were you in Louisiana I was one of the controllers
[03:19:48.240 --> 03:19:52.040]  at Barksville working the power the control tower the day that fly that
[03:19:52.040 --> 03:19:56.480]  aircraft flew in so we were unaware of that thing was loaded with anything
[03:19:56.480 --> 03:20:01.560]  because and the past and even after that when we do any type of mission where we
[03:20:01.560 --> 03:20:06.120]  move nuclear warheads around it is serious security stuff and to have this
[03:20:06.120 --> 03:20:11.880]  happening nobody know anything about it except for me the air crew and it's
[03:20:11.880 --> 03:20:15.200]  scary stuff so I just think they got their hand caught in the cookie jar the
[03:20:15.200 --> 03:20:18.680]  first time get some patriot somebody okay so you were you were outside Shreve
[03:20:18.680 --> 03:20:22.360]  Port at the air base when the nukes came in my wife your new listener work this
[03:20:22.360 --> 03:20:27.640]  is on record and the word was they were trying Cheney gave the order and wanted
[03:20:27.640 --> 03:20:31.480]  these to be disappeared but people learned what happened and they couldn't be
[03:20:31.480 --> 03:20:36.240]  offloaded you know when it got down you know closer to where the aircraft were
[03:20:36.240 --> 03:20:40.320]  kept and then I'm sure you know if you know the story then do you know what
[03:20:40.320 --> 03:20:43.640]  happened up in North Dakota at the other base you know a bunch of people got
[03:20:43.640 --> 03:20:48.320]  killed who were witnesses about people being I know I know that the entire wing
[03:20:48.320 --> 03:20:53.880]  force the higher-ups the command section all fired all removed from
[03:20:53.880 --> 03:20:58.400]  position and they brought in new people to replace sure but I remember
[03:20:58.400 --> 03:21:01.560]  covering at the time people go they were like people that loaded them and were
[03:21:01.560 --> 03:21:04.800]  there and who who were witnesses to what really happened they all committed
[03:21:04.800 --> 03:21:09.320]  suicide or died in car wrecks and the action the friend of mine who told me
[03:21:09.320 --> 03:21:14.320]  what happened with this discovery in Barksdale I mean we haven't
[03:21:14.320 --> 03:21:17.960]  spoke lately but I know that he's still alive in a well but this is one of those
[03:21:17.960 --> 03:21:22.560]  things where I never really thought about it at first Alex until the diet
[03:21:22.560 --> 03:21:25.920]  thing came up the other day and you talked about it this morning and I was
[03:21:25.920 --> 03:21:30.560]  like you know what I have first-hand knowledge of this going on and I talked
[03:21:30.560 --> 03:21:33.560]  to the aircraft I landed them I mean it's one of those things are well the
[03:21:33.560 --> 03:21:37.680]  word is everybody was freaking out at Dias going why are there nukes here
[03:21:37.680 --> 03:21:41.240]  they're not supposed to be here and then why is it their paperwork and why are
[03:21:41.240 --> 03:21:46.200]  there army special forces here getting warheads and there was reportedly a bunch
[03:21:46.200 --> 03:21:49.840]  of arguments and things but that was the end of it and they rolled down the road
[03:21:49.840 --> 03:21:53.320]  with them so I don't I don't know that's why I opened the phones up about this
[03:21:53.320 --> 03:21:58.880]  today this is this is a big deal and I don't know what's going on and again I
[03:21:58.880 --> 03:22:03.040]  I wish I wouldn't have been given this info but but in a way I mean it's my
[03:22:03.040 --> 03:22:06.800]  duty to put it out here but I guess who else are they gonna come to I guess it
[03:22:06.800 --> 03:22:10.800]  comes down to that well absolutely you know it's one of those things where when
[03:22:10.800 --> 03:22:14.480]  you think about the the larger picture of what's happening globally and in the
[03:22:14.480 --> 03:22:17.720]  fact that I've done three combat tours over there come back alive without a
[03:22:17.720 --> 03:22:22.240]  scratch I may thank God and I see what what's gonna happen in the future here
[03:22:22.240 --> 03:22:26.400]  and all I do is worry about the men and women of our armed services because in
[03:22:26.400 --> 03:22:30.280]  order to incite the next war do you have to have a tragic event which which
[03:22:30.280 --> 03:22:34.720]  might be a false flag to get the the true free Patriots of this country to
[03:22:34.720 --> 03:22:38.480]  step up and fight a war that's unjust sure I want to be clear I want to be
[03:22:38.480 --> 03:22:42.720]  clear here the don't just think if this was some type of false flag set up which
[03:22:42.720 --> 03:22:46.000]  I don't know it might have been might be open the phones up to hear other
[03:22:46.000 --> 03:22:50.640]  reasons I want to find out why this doesn't look so bad why my gut tells
[03:22:50.640 --> 03:22:54.000]  me this is the most horrible thing in my life I mean worse than deaths in the
[03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:58.520]  family I feel completely just beyond freaked out just just completely awake
[03:22:58.520 --> 03:23:02.760]  I just feel totally shocked at every level my gut tells me this is super
[03:23:02.760 --> 03:23:06.680]  horrible and I've opened the phones up for the military to call in and tell me
[03:23:06.680 --> 03:23:09.920]  how I'm wrong today you know a guy called in saying maybe this is a hoax and he
[03:23:09.920 --> 03:23:13.240]  thought I would be mad at him I was hoping like he was a life raft that
[03:23:13.240 --> 03:23:17.920]  that you know I was wrong about this but don't think that if we put this out
[03:23:17.920 --> 03:23:21.400]  and this was a false flag plan that they're going to they'll just go to
[03:23:21.400 --> 03:23:24.720]  another plan they have always got a bunch of plans going so we need
[03:23:24.720 --> 03:23:29.880]  everybody to have their eyeballs open and carrying video cameras or their
[03:23:29.880 --> 03:23:34.440]  iPhones or droids and and and and we need the citizens see something say
[03:23:34.440 --> 03:23:38.720]  something we need to be watching everything and here's the good news
[03:23:38.720 --> 03:23:45.000]  underwear bombing Boston bombing so many other events our people are now
[03:23:45.000 --> 03:23:50.120]  everywhere awake liberty-loving conscious smart people not even Americans
[03:23:50.120 --> 03:23:54.720]  just humans that want justice but but good Americans and police and and and
[03:23:54.720 --> 03:23:59.600]  FBI and secret service I mean and federal marshals I mean I can't believe
[03:23:59.600 --> 03:24:03.400]  I'm still alive because folks we've got real whistleblowers okay we've got we
[03:24:03.400 --> 03:24:07.400]  we and notice you're not hearing any news about this because it's so big
[03:24:07.400 --> 03:24:12.560]  notice you're not hearing anything about this because it's so huge because the
[03:24:12.560 --> 03:24:16.400]  system is freaking out we've called Graham's office they've got video of it
[03:24:16.400 --> 03:24:19.920]  we've called the base the base is like we can't talk about the weapons transfer
[03:24:19.920 --> 03:24:28.240]  I mean so this is a big deal and we need to get the word out but also the
[03:24:28.240 --> 03:24:32.720]  establishment needs to know if they try to carry something out now it's not like
[03:24:32.720 --> 03:24:39.680]  we're blind to what's going on do you see what I'm saying Justin oh absolutely
[03:24:39.680 --> 03:24:43.920]  Alex and one of those things where you just gotta just be aware of what's
[03:24:43.920 --> 03:24:47.280]  going on do the do as much as you can they call call your congressman call
[03:24:47.280 --> 03:24:49.720]  your senators and tell them you know that we don't agree with it because the
[03:24:49.720 --> 03:24:52.960]  American boys is not behind this you know what you get it behind it is to have
[03:24:52.960 --> 03:24:57.200]  a false flag or to get hit or so allowed to get it because I tell you what we
[03:24:57.200 --> 03:25:01.600]  strike Syria Russia's not gonna back down and then if it's blocked attacks
[03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:05.360]  Israel then we got to step in and protect our ally or Turkey get fed and
[03:25:05.360 --> 03:25:09.520]  this is just this is not checkers anymore so this is this is chest and this is
[03:25:09.520 --> 03:25:13.040]  getting way out of hand here and people need to wake up because we're so we're
[03:25:13.040 --> 03:25:17.280]  so in tune to our Facebook and to our TV's it's like wake up and smell the
[03:25:17.280 --> 03:25:20.920]  coffee everybody exactly there are Chinese and Russian ships lining up the
[03:25:20.920 --> 03:25:25.280]  Wall Street journals talking about let's just blow them up I mean and it's some
[03:25:25.280 --> 03:25:28.600]  little idiot reporter that's never probably been in a fist fight much less
[03:25:28.600 --> 03:25:33.640]  combat just shooting their mouths off it's general Dempsey who's known as a
[03:25:33.640 --> 03:25:38.080]  hawk saying don't do it don't do it but all these Harvard lawyers are going
[03:25:38.080 --> 03:25:41.280]  ahead to play play warrior because they've got more advanced weapons than
[03:25:41.280 --> 03:25:44.720]  the Russians so they just think they can have this war because they've all got
[03:25:44.720 --> 03:25:49.600]  bunkers they're the threat and they run al-Qaeda and it's all out in the open
[03:25:49.600 --> 03:25:54.440]  and so look as negative as all this news is the positive news is people are
[03:25:54.440 --> 03:25:58.120]  waking up and I think cooler heads are going to prevail God bless you good to
[03:25:58.120 --> 03:26:02.200]  hear from you Justin what an amazing call by the way I've seen comments on
[03:26:02.200 --> 03:26:05.960]  YouTube and comments on my site saying I'm making up the North Dakota missing
[03:26:05.960 --> 03:26:11.720]  nuke stuff that's on record okay believe me little boys out there some of you who
[03:26:11.720 --> 03:26:15.200]  want to say I'm making this stuff up believe me I wish this was made up I
[03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:19.840]  wish my duty was not to sit there and tell you the truth okay but my guts
[03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:26.000]  cannot let me lie my guts cannot let me do the wrong thing even though it's
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:30.560]  bad probably for me okay individually I care more about my family and your
[03:26:30.560 --> 03:26:35.240]  family than I do about my own safety and and that's just common instinct folks
[03:26:35.240 --> 03:26:39.680]  we've lost common sense out there we wouldn't be slaves right now if other
[03:26:39.680 --> 03:26:43.920]  men wouldn't put up with this type of bull instead men think it's fun to go
[03:26:43.920 --> 03:26:49.040]  watch football all day you're not gonna have your stinking football if we have
[03:26:49.040 --> 03:26:54.320]  World War three your kids are gonna be dead while John Kerry and all those
[03:26:54.320 --> 03:27:00.240]  bastards are in bunkers two miles under mountains had enough of this crap excuse
[03:27:00.240 --> 03:27:07.360]  me excuse me I'm gonna try not to get angry let's talk to JC in Montana JC
[03:27:07.360 --> 03:27:10.200]  what's your take on all this
[03:27:10.200 --> 03:27:20.040]  former recon marine what's got I've got a buddy that's in the DOE he tried to get
[03:27:20.040 --> 03:27:25.160]  me to go in there with him we're both from Marines together and what's got me
[03:27:25.160 --> 03:27:31.800]  concerned is if the DOE wasn't there to pick this up any any any transported
[03:27:31.800 --> 03:27:37.440]  nuke on the ground DOE is there and the DOE the people to transport this are
[03:27:37.440 --> 03:27:41.760]  like him their former recon their Rangers they're all yeah it's the Department of
[03:27:41.760 --> 03:27:47.400]  Energy's over it yes yeah and but they're they're in the government but
[03:27:47.400 --> 03:27:51.120]  they're not in the military anymore their former military that they use to
[03:27:51.120 --> 03:27:55.000]  transport this stuff and they roll heavy they roll armored Humvees and their
[03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:59.360]  orders are anyone breaches the line on a transported nuke orders are to shoot the
[03:27:59.360 --> 03:28:03.360]  kill and they got more toys than most military any military convoy that
[03:28:03.360 --> 03:28:08.520]  rolled and I mean their orders are anyone that breaches the line when
[03:28:08.520 --> 03:28:12.760]  they're going down the interstate are to shoot the kill and they're loaded and
[03:28:12.760 --> 03:28:18.160]  hot as we're going down the road what got me concerned is that the DOE wasn't
[03:28:18.160 --> 03:28:23.320]  there to pick this up that's kind of spooky to me well and then a caller said
[03:28:23.320 --> 03:28:26.960]  he you know he says he drives these convoys as a former special ops guy and
[03:28:26.960 --> 03:28:31.320]  he thinks it's a hoax I hope he's right because I because here's the deal this
[03:28:31.320 --> 03:28:35.240]  really happened but maybe they weren't nukes maybe my source is wrong if people
[03:28:35.240 --> 03:28:38.560]  knew the source was they wouldn't think that and it's just super creepy because
[03:28:38.560 --> 03:28:43.320]  then you've got the South Carolina situation and and all I know is I don't
[03:28:43.320 --> 03:28:45.960]  know all the particulars I know the people there were freaked out about it
[03:28:45.960 --> 03:28:54.320]  okay whatever went on and and no it was special forces out of was it was arming
[03:28:54.320 --> 03:28:59.320]  out of Florida was there picking it up that's the word that doesn't make any
[03:28:59.320 --> 03:29:03.640]  sense the DOE with their guys should be there they got their own unit they got
[03:29:03.640 --> 03:29:08.440]  their own armored monkeys they got 50s they're loaded hot they're ready to roll
[03:29:08.440 --> 03:29:12.040]  I mean take the guy here's my issue that guy's saying this can't happen how did
[03:29:12.040 --> 03:29:17.120]  my not happen how did that happen six years ago no I understand that that's
[03:29:17.120 --> 03:29:21.120]  what I'm saying I mean that's what's scared me is if this was a nuclear
[03:29:21.120 --> 03:29:27.160]  weapon picked up if what's scared me is that the DOE was not there that's what's
[03:29:27.160 --> 03:29:33.360]  scared me no understand it wasn't standard that's why that's why the I'm
[03:29:33.360 --> 03:29:36.120]  not gonna tell more of the stories that'll give it away I'm not allowed to
[03:29:36.120 --> 03:29:39.480]  talk anymore the point is is that it's not that I'm not allowed to it'll give
[03:29:39.480 --> 03:29:43.520]  away some of the info there was a big deal over this okay people said this is
[03:29:43.520 --> 03:29:47.080]  not right what's going on and it was a big deal that's why people were freaked
[03:29:47.080 --> 03:29:50.920]  out enough to call me I'll see you back tonight back this weekend Lord willing
