[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:10.000 --> 00:17.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:25.000]  We are in the process of a time of great enlightenment, of revealing, taking place.
[00:25.000 --> 00:29.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones. We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:29.000 --> 00:33.000]  First off, though, here is a powerful report from John Bowen.
[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000]  I'm sorry I'm having a personal crisis.
[00:36.000 --> 00:37.000]  What?
[00:37.000 --> 00:39.000]  What am I going to do?
[00:39.000 --> 00:47.000]  Oh, poor baby. Why don't you make an amends to her? Tell her how genuinely sorry you are. She's got to accept that.
[00:47.000 --> 00:58.000]  Leigh Ann Tweedon, a model, sports broadcaster and TV host, has revealed the behind-the-scenes harassment she endured on a USO tour with Senator Al Franken M. Singh.
[00:58.000 --> 01:02.000]  Al came up to me and he's like, well, we need to rehearse our kiss.
[01:02.000 --> 01:07.000]  And I'm like, yeah, okay. And I just blew him off, you know, because I'm thinking, we don't need to rehearse the kiss.
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  I mean, we're doing a live, you know, 60-second skit in front of troops. We're not filming a movie, right?
[01:13.000 --> 01:20.000]  And so I blew him off because I didn't think he was serious. And then he kind of said it again.
[01:20.000 --> 01:27.000]  He's like, well, we need to rehearse the kiss, Leigh Ann. And I'm like, okay, Al, okay, you turn your head to the right. I'll turn my head to the right.
[01:27.000 --> 01:33.000]  Okay, we got this. It was relentless. That's what I could hear in his voice, right? He started getting relentless.
[01:33.000 --> 01:39.000]  And I'm like, why is he insisting that we have to rehearse the damn kiss? I mean, it's just a, it's like a fake kiss, right?
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  This is all I could think about. I'm like, good God, Al, you know, it's just, it's not SNL for goodness sakes, right?
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  We rehearsed the line and I'm coming towards him and he comes up and he grabs me and he puts his hand behind my head.
[01:51.000 --> 01:56.000]  And he aggressively comes in and he mashes his mouth up against mine and he sticks his tongue in my mouth.
[01:56.000 --> 02:03.000]  And as it happens, it happens so fast and he puts his tongue in my mouth and his mouth is just wet and slimy.
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  And to this day, I call him fish lips, okay? Because it's disgusting.
[02:07.000 --> 02:14.000]  In January, Franken went for the jugular on the GOP championing sexual assault victims.
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.000]  Twenty-five percent of American women say they have experienced sexual harassment in the workplace.
[02:21.000 --> 02:31.000]  In recent high profile revelations about abuse, for example, former Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes abuse of his employees,
[02:31.000 --> 02:37.000]  as well as the allegations of sex bias at Kay and Sterling Jewelers,
[02:37.000 --> 02:44.000]  demonstrate that we are far from addressing this issue on a broader scale.
[02:44.000 --> 02:51.000]  So I urge my Republican colleagues to reconsider their support for this resolution.
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  I urge them, not the force of honorable women who have been wronged into the dark.
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  Franken's hypocrisy even went so far as to silence dissent among American news media.
[03:05.000 --> 03:09.000]  And the power trip isn't just resonating from Franken's office.
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.000]  Two unnamed current members of Congress have engaged in sexual harassment,
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.000]  one of them allegedly exposing themselves to a staffer.
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  Like so many of you, I have a me too story to share.
[03:24.000 --> 03:33.000]  I was working as a congressional staffer. The chief of staff held my face, kissed me, and stuck his tongue in my mouth.
[03:33.000 --> 03:37.000]  So I know what it's like to keep these things hidden deep down inside.
[03:37.000 --> 03:44.000]  I know what it's like to lie awake in bed at night wondering if I was the one who had done something wrong.
[03:44.000 --> 03:50.000]  I know what it's like years later to remember that rush of humiliation and anger.
[03:50.000 --> 04:01.000]  You know what? Many of us in Congress know what it's like because Congress has been a breeding ground for a hostile work environment for far too long.
[04:01.000 --> 04:12.000]  That's why I'm reaching out to congressional staff and to former congressional staff to share their me too Congress stories if they feel comfortable in doing so.
[04:12.000 --> 04:24.000]  Representative Jackie Spear also recently revealed that Congress has paid out 260 harassment settlements in the last 20 years to the tune of 15 million taxpayer dollars.
[04:24.000 --> 04:40.000]  Talk about hypocrisy. It's gotten so bad that congressional staffers signed an open letter demanding mandatory harassment training for the hordes of perverted power mad congressmen and congresswomen darkening the doorsteps of our nation's capital.
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  Al Franken should resign today because he's simply the first domino to fall.
[04:45.000 --> 05:10.000]  John Bown reporting for info wars dot com.
[05:10.000 --> 05:21.000]  It's 25% off the truck got in this morning and it's back but it is a limited run because of all the testing and all the rest of it is the highest quality.
[05:21.000 --> 05:24.000]  Read about what it'll do for you and your family. It is amazing.
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  We also have been sold out for three months on biome defense super high quality probiotic.
[05:29.000 --> 05:35.000]  It's 25% off out of the gates back in stock but for a very limited time.
[05:35.000 --> 05:40.000]  So you get the highest quality, the very cleanest stuff out there. We're really, really proud of it.
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  DNA force and biome defense, probiotic. Now back in stock info wars life dot com.
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  When you buy products from globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[05:47.000 --> 06:00.000]  It is an act of war. It is an act of standing up when you spread the links, the articles and buy products from us and then we commit rampage against the enemy totally.
[06:00.000 --> 06:11.000]  We've got it. Waging war on corruption.
[06:11.000 --> 06:23.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:23.000 --> 06:45.000]  Last time I checked, more than $8 billion had been paid out since 1983 to the secret vaccine damage fund by a secret federal court whose job it is to cover up the deaths, the brain damage, the paralyzations that have happened by the hundreds and thousands, by frankly the millions that have been brain damaged.
[06:45.000 --> 07:03.000]  We're going to be breaking that down today because there's another secret fund we just learned about in Congress to pay off the sexual harassment and sexual assault of women and yes men and yes underage pages that are raped on the desk.
[07:03.000 --> 07:07.000]  That's all coming up today and more.
[07:07.000 --> 07:20.000]  But first, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to get to a powerful report by Paul Joseph Watson dealing with a new type of superhero that we're dealing with and of course that soy boy.
[07:20.000 --> 07:28.000]  Now a lot of these folks that have been damaged by this and the other estrogen mimicers that are in our environment like their enslavement.
[07:28.000 --> 07:39.000]  So we found the only way to reach out to him is kind of making a sick joke about it, but it's hurting all of us and it's hyper feminizing women and accelerating breast cancer and other problems in the womb as well.
[07:39.000 --> 07:49.000]  So I want to get to this powerful report and then we'll get into the science behind it after that tie it into vaccines and so much more because this is a directed agenda.
[07:49.000 --> 07:58.000]  It's an admitted social engineering agenda to break up the family to discredit men to emasculate men and more.
[07:58.000 --> 08:23.000]  Here's Paul Joseph Watson's report.
[08:23.000 --> 08:35.000]  Now, as we know, the only men who seriously watch Buzzfeed are tofu eating male feminist virtue signaling, beta orbiter, soy boys, which led me to this one of the funniest things on Twitter ever.
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  This guy's compiled a huge list of the most virulently insufferable far leftists on Twitter.
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  And guess what? They all consume soy products in copious quantities.
[08:44.000 --> 08:51.000]  Remember Will Wheaton, the twat who insulted Christians immediately after the Texas church massacre of Christians.
[08:51.000 --> 08:57.000]  He's a soy boy, the Pezneck New York Antifa professor who constantly tweets about wanting cops to be killed.
[08:57.000 --> 09:03.000]  He's a soy boy, Casey Newton, the Verge editor who said he'd walk through fire for Hillary Clinton.
[09:03.000 --> 09:11.000]  He's a soy boy, Arthur Chiu, the Jeopardy winner who's such a good feminist he wants to wipe out all men and admits he can't satisfy his wife.
[09:11.000 --> 09:17.000]  He's a soy boy, he's such a soy boy he thinks Starbucks charging extra for soy milk is racist.
[09:17.000 --> 09:21.000]  This guy who said he was suicidal because he's ethnically white.
[09:21.000 --> 09:25.000]  He's a soy boy, this Tumblr male feminist who brags about how wealth he is.
[09:25.000 --> 09:29.000]  He's a soy boy, this dude who's such an odd and feminist he took his wife's last name.
[09:29.000 --> 09:36.000]  He's a soy boy, this idiot who thinks saying all lives matter is racist and hates his own family because they're conservative.
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  He's a soy boy, this communist who thinks anyone who disparages soy is a fascist.
[09:42.000 --> 09:48.000]  He's a soy boy, Jesse Cox, the comedian who said he'd rather die than see America stop taking in refugees.
[09:48.000 --> 09:59.000]  He'd be a soy boy, and that's the thing, there seems to be an even closer correlation between male feminist virtue signalers who defend Muslim refugees and they're soy fetish.
[09:59.000 --> 10:05.000]  Despite the fact that the mass importation of people from a society that literally produced something called the rape game
[10:05.000 --> 10:09.000]  is putting more women at risk than ever before. Yeah, not very feminist that, is it?
[10:09.000 --> 10:13.000]  Say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here, delicious tofu dog.
[10:13.000 --> 10:14.000]  Soy boy.
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  If the US cared about civilians in Syria maybe it shouldn't have stopped accepting them as refugee.
[10:17.000 --> 10:23.000]  When your local Thai food spot calls you back to make sure you only want two orders of tofu drunk and new because you usually are the three.
[10:23.000 --> 10:24.000]  Soy boy.
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  If you're LGBT and support Trump's Muslim and refugee bans you're putting many of our brothers and sisters at risk and f**k you.
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.000]  Soy isn't healthy.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  Okay, but I'm literally using it as a dairy subsidy so what's your point?
[10:33.000 --> 10:34.000]  Soy boy.
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.000]  If the refugee men are far more likely to be rapists statically, stop being a den of hope.
[10:38.000 --> 10:47.000]  This guy posted a picture of his soy filled fridge then said if his own son turned into a woman because of eating too much soy, he wouldn't see it as a negative.
[10:47.000 --> 10:48.000]  Soy boy.
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.000]  I wonder if the Norwegian guy who felt guilty about the Muslim migrant who raped him being deported is also a soy boy.
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  Bet he is.
[10:56.000 --> 10:59.000]  What is it about soy that turns men into such spineless wimps?
[10:59.000 --> 11:02.000]  This guy is such a total f*****g of stunning.
[11:02.000 --> 11:10.000]  Soy beans contain high amounts of phytoestrogens, organic compounds that mimic the female hormone estrogen in the human body.
[11:10.000 --> 11:13.000]  This reduces testosterone and lowers male sperm count.
[11:13.000 --> 11:20.000]  Men who eat half a serving of soy a day have 34 million fewer sperm per millimetre than those who don't.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  Men with low testosterone have impaired sexual functioning.
[11:23.000 --> 11:24.000]  They lose their libido.
[11:24.000 --> 11:27.000]  Men with high estrogen take on feminine traits.
[11:27.000 --> 11:29.000]  They find it harder to handle stress.
[11:29.000 --> 11:30.000]  I'm triggered.
[11:30.000 --> 11:32.000]  They become less assertive.
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  They become low energy.
[11:34.000 --> 11:35.000]  Their voices get higher.
[11:35.000 --> 11:36.000]  Their genitals shrink.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  They lose muscle tone and they lose hair.
[11:39.000 --> 11:49.000]  The fact that they use soy therapy for women that are post menopause, meaning that their femininity has sort of dropped, right?
[11:49.000 --> 11:51.000]  They don't have as much estrogen.
[11:51.000 --> 12:02.000]  They use soy to produce more womanly hormones for those types of women is a clear indicator to me that I don't want to take that because I don't want to be more womanly.
[12:02.000 --> 12:06.000]  Men with high testosterone handle dramatic situations better.
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  They don't get scared by loud noises.
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  Low testosterone is also linked with mood swings and depression.
[12:12.000 --> 12:20.000]  It's a constant source of interest to me how my most obsessive and vehement haters on the left always relentlessly complain about how maniacally depressed
[12:20.000 --> 12:21.000]  they are.
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  Studies have repeatedly shown how liberals are more unhappy than conservatives.
[12:25.000 --> 12:34.000]  Every year since 1972 when Pew began its study, significantly more Republicans have reported themselves to be very happy compared to Democrats.
[12:34.000 --> 12:38.000]  Soy lowers testosterone and low testosterone causes depression.
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  Obviously it's not the only factor, but consider this.
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  In 1992, soy food sales in the US stood at $300 million a year.
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  They now stand at over $4 billion a year.
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.000]  This has coincided with a substantial drop in men's testosterone levels in the US since the 80s.
[12:55.000 --> 13:07.000]  According to Dr. Thomas Traveson and his colleagues behind one such study, the average levels of the male hormone are dropping by about 1% per year.
[13:07.000 --> 13:17.000]  This means that a 40 year old man in 2017 would have testosterone levels about 20% lower than a 40 year old in 1997.
[13:17.000 --> 13:22.000]  Surgeons are also conducting an all-time record number of operations to reduce man boobs.
[13:22.000 --> 13:26.000]  Such soy be one of the causes of this surgeon men growing Babylonians.
[13:26.000 --> 13:28.000]  And I'm not talking about obesity.
[13:28.000 --> 13:34.000]  We're talking about otherwise healthy and lean boys and young men suffering from gynecomastia.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  Otherwise known as f*** it.
[13:36.000 --> 13:43.000]  According to Dr. Kayla T. Daniel, the cause is environmental estrogens, including, you guessed it, soy.
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  All of those soybeans contain phytoestrogens.
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  That's plant estrogens.
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  And they are a form of estrogenizing influence on the body.
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  They create hormonal havoc.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  They create endocrine disruption.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  And who's most at risk?
[13:59.000 --> 14:05.000]  Well, boys who were on soy infant formula when they were babies.
[14:05.000 --> 14:14.000]  Boys who grew up and their brains and bodies developed on soy milk and other phytoestrogenic foods.
[14:14.000 --> 14:23.000]  And young men and older men who get health conscious and start drinking a lot of soy milk and eat soy shakes and soy energy bars.
[14:23.000 --> 14:26.000]  Moves can be one of the side effects.
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  After retired US Army intelligence officer James Price was diagnosed with gynecomastia.
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  He was found to have estrogen levels in his bloodstream eight times the normal limit for men.
[14:36.000 --> 14:39.000]  Take a rough guess at what Price's favorite drink was.
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.000]  Soy milk currents are switching their infants over to soy baby formula in droves.
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  25% of babies in America are now fed soy infant formula.
[14:48.000 --> 14:56.000]  A baby exclusively fed soy formula receives the estrogenic equivalent of at least five birth control pills per day.
[14:56.000 --> 15:04.000]  So that suggests that rather than people with already pre-existing left-wing beliefs being attracted to vegan-style tofu soy diets.
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  We're actually creating an army of soy boys from birth.
[15:08.000 --> 15:09.000]  What a terrifying thought.
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  And let's be clear.
[15:10.000 --> 15:11.000]  I'm not talking about gay people.
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  I don't think soy changes sexuality.
[15:14.000 --> 15:18.000]  I'm talking about effeminate acting straight guys.
[15:18.000 --> 15:20.000]  Let's call them try guys.
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.000]  When it comes to men actually behaving and acting like men, soy is the silent killer.
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  We're losing an entire generation of young men to soy men.
[15:30.000 --> 15:36.000]  If you don't want to develop a bunch of retarded beliefs about how inviting in millions of rapey migrants is a great idea.
[15:36.000 --> 15:39.000]  About how anyone to the right of Michael Moore is literally Hitler.
[15:39.000 --> 15:41.000]  About how fantastic communism is.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  Or about how being a white man is shameful and wrong.
[15:44.000 --> 15:50.000]  By literally growing and seeing your penis shrink at the same time when it comes to soy.
[15:50.000 --> 15:51.000]  Just say no.
[15:51.000 --> 16:19.000]  Today with us ladies and gentlemen Moore straight ahead.

[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  you are funding the revolution. I cannot say it any clearer.
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.000]  So it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com.
[19:25.000 --> 19:32.000]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodide in it.
[19:32.000 --> 19:37.000]  I cannot beat that for children and adults. We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.000]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  Infowarslife.com or triple-A-253-3139.
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  And your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[19:48.000 --> 19:51.000]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[19:51.000 --> 19:56.000]  And that's who they are and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[19:56.000 --> 20:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:27.000 --> 20:37.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[20:37.000 --> 20:52.000]  There was a group of seven families hired by the British Crown in 1855 to do a genetic breedline test to try to discover why the royal family was having so many genetic problems.
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  They were also seeking to discover the makeup of the human DNA.
[20:57.000 --> 21:05.000]  They were postulating that they could discover what we were made of and that they would also develop systems of social control over the population.
[21:05.000 --> 21:14.000]  A grandson of that breeding program, Aldous Huxley, wrote A Brave New World in 1932.
[21:14.000 --> 21:23.000]  Now, there's a reason that he put the book out. He later said in 1961 in a speech at Berkeley and in a book titled Brave New World Revisited,
[21:23.000 --> 21:34.000]  that they were going to put chemicals in the food and water to make men basically feminine and then to hype women up into a hyper-feminine state.
[21:34.000 --> 21:42.000]  But that was only phase one. They would then completely remove humans having intercourse and humans would be created in the Petri dish.
[21:42.000 --> 21:53.000]  We're now here. Shift understand, this is a plan. You read something written in 1932 that was close to 100 years of advanced research knowledge.
[21:53.000 --> 22:00.000]  They invented biometrics, everything. His brother went on to run the United Nations World Government Program for UNESCO.
[22:00.000 --> 22:03.000]  That is an adopted by all the major nation states.
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  The reason I point that out is when we talk about is soy making us feminine.
[22:08.000 --> 22:12.000]  Is soy driving down sperm counts? Well, it's weaponized soy.
[22:12.000 --> 22:17.000]  They grind up the core of the soy and put it in the soy milk, not just the outside of the soy.
[22:17.000 --> 22:22.000]  So yes, it has caused a lot of genetic things in Asian men over generations.
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.000]  I'm not going to go into all the genetic things. Everybody knows what's happened.
[22:26.000 --> 22:36.000]  And now it's being done on a hyper level with the new types of soy where they don't get rid of the part of the plant that's even higher in estrogen.
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  And this is a estrogen drug that men are on.
[22:40.000 --> 22:45.000]  So you wonder why they're so depressed, freaking out, hating everyone, trying to be feminine.
[22:45.000 --> 22:48.000]  They are taking weapons grade levels.
[22:48.000 --> 22:58.000]  Now women that take this, it grows super fast cancers in the ovaries, super fast cancers in the uterus, super fast cancers in the breast tissue.
[22:58.000 --> 23:02.000]  It's an admitted fact. Goliath of Satan does it as well.
[23:02.000 --> 23:12.000]  And you sit here and warn people and the soy makers push the Google results and others where you've got all their debunking at the top that's total lies.
[23:12.000 --> 23:18.000]  It is an absolute fact that soy alone is a main contributor.
[23:18.000 --> 23:23.000]  And then you've got the estrogen members they use in printer ink, all the major printer inks.
[23:23.000 --> 23:28.000]  It's just overwhelming. It's not debatable.
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  Just like vaccines cause what they say they're stopping most of the time.
[23:32.000 --> 23:37.000]  Don't protect you. I've got a big stack of news and government reports right from it.
[23:37.000 --> 23:42.000]  They put out puff pieces for Google at the top that are all total lies.
[23:42.000 --> 23:49.000]  But it's a fact and I've got all the statistics, the numbers from the government, from the CDC internally in 2000 saying we've got to stop this.
[23:49.000 --> 23:52.000]  It's caused millions of people to be brain damaged.
[23:52.000 --> 23:59.000]  We've paid out billions of dollars secretly just like they pay out secretly for the sexual harassment.
[23:59.000 --> 24:05.000]  This is the big issue. So Paul Joseph Watson has a very, very important report.
[24:05.000 --> 24:16.000]  It's titled Soy Boy to try to reach out to these people and show them why they're so depressed, why they're so unhealthy and why they're so crazy, hyper feminine, hysterical from the Greek word.
[24:16.000 --> 24:23.000]  You can go back to Latin. I guess after that they're dealing with the uterus or a hysterectomy.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  You should cut out the hysteria.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  The point is that that's what's happening with these people.
[24:28.000 --> 24:35.000]  And it's a scientific plan and the articles on newswars.com about the Soy Boy phenomenon.
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  It's a very, very serious issue.
[24:37.000 --> 24:44.000]  Men from just 20 years ago already have a massive reduction in testosterone.
[24:44.000 --> 24:50.000]  If you go back 40 years, it's even more intense. Men have less than half the testosterone they did.
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.000]  This is a program in the West as soon as other countries become westernized, the same thing happens.
[24:56.000 --> 25:06.000]  Let me show you some photos of Clint Eastwood, not a big steroid head, not a hyper masculine guy, but a guy who's almost 90 years old and who exercises and takes care of himself.
[25:06.000 --> 25:14.000]  I mean, there he is back in the 50s, okay? Clint Eastwood, classical masculine traits, okay?
[25:14.000 --> 25:22.000]  Longevity, strong, productive, honorable, hardworking guy, quit his big career to be in the Korean War, even though he was already a star, came back after that.
[25:22.000 --> 25:25.000]  A great patriot. Let's look at the modern male.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  Let's put him on screen. I'll describe it for radio listeners.
[25:27.000 --> 25:37.000]  Wearing a shirt that says white males are terrorists, white men are terrorists, and that, ladies and gentlemen, is a male.
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.000]  That is not a female. The person's been contacted, it's been identified.
[25:43.000 --> 25:51.000]  So that is a man who absolutely then sees what's left of old masculinity and because they don't have it, they hate it.
[25:51.000 --> 25:56.000]  This is classical projection, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:56.000 --> 26:05.000]  So there you go. And then people revel in being unhealthy, revel in being weak, revel in being mentally ill because they're addicted to the poison.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  A heroin head will make excuses about why they're on heroin. An alcoholic will do the same thing.
[26:10.000 --> 26:19.000]  These people are addicted to super weaponized estrogen and they are whacked out of their brains and they don't know how to get out of it.
[26:19.000 --> 26:25.000]  And they don't know why they have the highest suicide rates or why they're so depressed or why things are so horrible.
[26:25.000 --> 26:32.000]  Because this is what has been done to them by design and that's the bottom line.
[26:32.000 --> 26:39.000]  The globalists admit that they're social engineer worldwide. They admit they have programs to break up the family and to target men.
[26:39.000 --> 26:44.000]  It's all declassified. They admit they promote ugly art. They promote the end of the family.
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  To control you, go re-brave new world.
[26:49.000 --> 26:55.000]  So get the video, soy boy out to everybody, but also this is a live radio slash television show.
[26:55.000 --> 27:00.000]  But later today when we post this to Facebook, we post this to Twitter, we're live streaming right now.
[27:00.000 --> 27:05.000]  Get it. Give it to young people in your family. Give it to your wife, your husband.
[27:05.000 --> 27:10.000]  Show them the footage. Show them the articles. Show them the documents. Show them the information.
[27:10.000 --> 27:16.000]  And also warm about vaccines. One of my friends, his wife, sneaks off with their baby and gets them vaccines.
[27:16.000 --> 27:23.000]  She's going to give them the flu shot at six months old. And she says, I don't care if it hurts them because it'll protect them from something else.
[27:23.000 --> 27:27.000]  But the statistics are all there. It doesn't. And we're going to go over some of those today.
[27:27.000 --> 27:38.000]  But you have to hammer people with this and you have to explain to them that just a year ago, research, Dr. Blalock, the science, the CDC reports that came out, those were the top of Google and Bing.
[27:38.000 --> 27:45.000]  They're all buried now. You have to know the exact headline, our exact study to find it.
[27:45.000 --> 27:54.000]  And we're going to be putting together special reports now just to put this knowledge out of the CDC's own head in 2000.
[27:54.000 --> 28:01.000]  The minutes got leaked in 2005. ABC News reported on it saying, we've got 2 million people seriously brain damaged in the last decade.
[28:01.000 --> 28:09.000]  Our numbers. He said, we've got hundreds of thousands that have died from MMR and other vaccines causing autoimmune response to the brain.
[28:09.000 --> 28:16.000]  We don't think they don't know. He goes, we're going to have a revolt on our hands if this goes public, but we've got to stop.
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  We've got to take the thimerosal out. But that's what the scientists told the director. It's not the thimerosal. That's part of it.
[28:21.000 --> 28:29.000]  The whole thing causes an autoimmune response. Let me tell you this. A baby by the time it's six months has had about 50 shots.
[28:29.000 --> 28:35.000]  Some of them have three or four things in each shot. Would you let 50 bees sting your baby?
[28:35.000 --> 28:44.000]  No, chances are they'd have an autoimmune response, swelling of the brain, swelling of other things, and then would possibly die.
[28:44.000 --> 28:50.000]  When you go get allergy shots just of, you know, Elm or whatever, they make you have an epipen to do it. I've done it.
[28:50.000 --> 28:57.000]  But why not with vaccines? Why don't epipen there? Because they don't want you to know it's an autoimmune response. It can kill you.
[28:57.000 --> 29:05.000]  Hey, Daniel Brieman, why Neumana storeable foods? We believe in freedom. America needs strong independent families to endure what's ahead.

[33:15.000 --> 33:31.000]  You are listening to an infowars.com frontline report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:31.000 --> 33:41.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:41.000 --> 34:02.000]  There are new documents out released by the Pentagon and the CDC telling us exactly what top neurologists, endocrinologists, brain surgeons, epidemiologists have told us here on this broadcast since they started giving U.S. troops the anthrax vaccine back during the first Gulf War and through it.
[34:02.000 --> 34:11.000]  They've had five rounds of it in five different years, spanned out from 1990 through just about what four years ago.
[34:11.000 --> 34:28.000]  They suspended giving the shots because there were so many deaths and they had entire wings of medical personnel including doctors leave because they would see up to 20% of the servicemen and women including special forces people.
[34:28.000 --> 34:39.000]  They weren't acting in bed for days, weeks, months or dying.
[34:39.000 --> 34:45.000]  Now ladies and gentlemen, you can look that up for yourself but it's all come out but listen, I had top scientists on.
[34:45.000 --> 34:53.000]  You know they've now found anthrax that they believe is a million years old under the permafrost that shouldn't be there.
[34:53.000 --> 34:58.000]  They're finding it inside rocks in coal mines.
[34:58.000 --> 35:15.000]  It is plant spore bacteria basically, bacteria that go to the plant family and the spores they believe might be how life started if you don't believe in God or God did it that way, floating on the solar lens.
[35:15.000 --> 35:32.000]  The elite are obsessed with it, they're also obsessed with something called gene lines, the Lazarus gene, immortal cell lines.
[35:32.000 --> 35:51.000]  They've found only a few hundred people that they've told us about who have cells that you can put in a petri dish and walk away and it has no food, no oxygen, no nothing sealed and the cells alive in 20 years.
[35:51.000 --> 35:56.000]  Look up immortal cell lines.
[35:56.000 --> 36:04.000]  Now they've also found that these are cancers, fast-acting cancers.
[36:04.000 --> 36:11.000]  When you get an immortal cell, it starts replicating and it kills you.
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.000]  This is not movies, this is not fiction, this is the equivalent of a zombie.
[36:16.000 --> 36:23.000]  It's why they call it the Lazarus gene or the Lazarus cell line.
[36:23.000 --> 36:42.000]  Now they did this to the troops to give them anthrax and then to have blood draws on individuals later to see if they created a mutagenic new system within the body and the troops were used in mass experiments and that's all coming out.
[36:42.000 --> 36:52.000]  They knew it was deadly, they knew it didn't protect them just like shooting black people up telling them it's vaccines and they were giving them life syphilis.
[36:52.000 --> 36:55.000]  By the thousands and then letting them spread it to hundreds of thousands.
[36:55.000 --> 37:06.000]  And next time your wife, because particularly women that get bullied by the media and the doctors, next time your wife's looking at you and she tells you, oh I'm going to give the baby all these shots, you can pull up all the reports where it doesn't protect them.
[37:06.000 --> 37:12.000]  It actually gives them the flu a lot of times, gives them the hepatitis, gives them the measles, mumps, rubella.
[37:12.000 --> 37:16.000]  The outbreaks are bigger in vaccinated groups, that's where the outbreaks are coming from.
[37:16.000 --> 37:22.000]  I have stacks of news here today.
[37:22.000 --> 37:27.000]  The inserts say on vaccines may cause miscarriage.
[37:27.000 --> 37:35.000]  Now there's all these studies out saying it's causing miscarriages and they're in the news going, gee could these studies be true?
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  Wow, this is amazing.
[37:37.000 --> 37:40.000]  Who would have ever thought?
[37:40.000 --> 37:45.000]  If a woman gets stung by 1b, she doesn't usually have.
[37:45.000 --> 37:52.000]  And I go to this because the average person can get this when you're trying to wake them up.
[37:52.000 --> 38:00.000]  When you get stung the first time by b, you don't usually have an autoimmune response.
[38:00.000 --> 38:02.000]  You don't usually have an allergy.
[38:02.000 --> 38:05.000]  You don't usually have your throat swell up.
[38:05.000 --> 38:09.000]  But the second time, third time, fourth, that's when you tend to get the allergy.
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.000]  Or when a whole bunch sting you.
[38:13.000 --> 38:16.000]  People used to be so afraid of bees when I was growing up.
[38:16.000 --> 38:19.000]  I've been stung many times, big deal be tough.
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  They go, no, no, I'm allergic.
[38:21.000 --> 38:24.000]  And I saw some kid at the pool swell up, almost died.
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  They had to put him in an ambulance and it was terrible.
[38:28.000 --> 38:35.000]  Then I got stung by swarm of bees once when I was plowing a field in my parents' place.
[38:35.000 --> 38:39.000]  I was plowing up an area my mom would put a garden into in between some trees.
[38:39.000 --> 38:43.000]  Some little area of trees on their four acres you're in town.
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  That's done probably 15 times.
[38:44.000 --> 38:45.000]  Whole swarm just like a movie.
[38:45.000 --> 38:46.000]  Chased me stung me.
[38:46.000 --> 38:47.000]  Chased me in the house.
[38:47.000 --> 38:50.000]  And just in the second I opened the door, five or six got in and were in the house.
[38:50.000 --> 38:55.000]  But it was like a big swarm, just like in the cartoons, big black swarm around me.
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  Pulling stingers out of my, whoa, all of a sudden throat starts swelling up.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  All of a sudden, can't breathe.
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  I go, I was like 18.
[39:03.000 --> 39:06.000]  I go into my parents' medicine cabinet.
[39:06.000 --> 39:07.000]  I know to take liquid Benadryl.
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  It's there.
[39:09.000 --> 39:10.000]  Guzzle it.
[39:10.000 --> 39:11.000]  Put baking soda to denature it.
[39:11.000 --> 39:12.000]  It's pulling stingers out.
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  Getting a cold shower.
[39:15.000 --> 39:16.000]  Start getting dizzy.
[39:16.000 --> 39:17.000]  Call my dad.
[39:17.000 --> 39:18.000]  He says, I'll be there in five minutes.
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  His dental office is like five minutes away.
[39:20.000 --> 39:21.000]  He gets there by then.
[39:21.000 --> 39:22.000]  It was already going down.
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  And I'm laid out naked on the kitchen floor.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  Swole up, but it was starting to go down.
[39:27.000 --> 39:32.000]  When you give a baby vaccines, it's the same thing in the studies.
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  They're having autoimmune responses.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  They start having convulsions.
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  They get blood on the brain.
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  The breathing area is close.
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  And now if you're smart, as they train the doctors,
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  we've played the clips on air at these big consortium meetings they have.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  They just had one a few months ago in Houston.
[39:47.000 --> 39:51.000]  Or one of the lead people said, it's white people that aren't taking vaccines.
[39:51.000 --> 39:52.000]  I just want to get rid of.
[39:52.000 --> 39:53.000]  We need to kill all the white people.
[39:53.000 --> 39:54.000]  Remember that clip?
[39:54.000 --> 39:55.000]  Sounded insane.
[39:55.000 --> 39:56.000]  Don't believe me.
[39:56.000 --> 39:57.000]  Just type it in.
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  Vaccine doctor says we should kill all the white people.
[39:59.000 --> 40:00.000]  You'll get the video.
[40:00.000 --> 40:03.000]  They had hundreds of doctors down there and they talked for hours.
[40:03.000 --> 40:07.000]  How do we force the public to take this stuff?
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  How do we lie to them?
[40:09.000 --> 40:10.000]  How do we?
[40:10.000 --> 40:11.000]  Well, don't lie.
[40:11.000 --> 40:12.000]  Just tell them.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  It's better your child have convulsions than ever get the flu.
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  So now they're having to admit, when you get a smart one,
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  but that's what they're telling you.
[40:20.000 --> 40:21.000]  Did you know?
[40:21.000 --> 40:22.000]  You can look it up yourself.
[40:22.000 --> 40:28.000]  The higher educated somebody is, the less vaccines they take.
[40:28.000 --> 40:29.000]  The higher educated.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  And you know who doesn't take them?
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  The doctors and the medical people.
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  That's what they're having to fire them all over the U.S.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  Because they see the premies that they give the vaccines to die.
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  They have to put them on respirators.
[40:40.000 --> 40:43.000]  They get the respirators ready when the bioethics board says,
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  we've got 20 premies in there unvaccinated.
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  Until about six years ago, you'd never do that.
[40:47.000 --> 40:48.000]  You said, it's a policy.
[40:48.000 --> 40:49.000]  Do it.
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  Just to see what they can get away with.
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  And they get the respirators ready.
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  A lot of times you lose the baby.
[40:55.000 --> 40:56.000]  We've had nurses on about it.
[40:56.000 --> 40:57.000]  It's been the news.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  Oh, that's a lot bigger than sexual harassment, isn't it?
[41:00.000 --> 41:04.000]  But it's hidden in plain view against those of us that are
[41:04.000 --> 41:08.000]  understand and are informed, the media lies and says,
[41:08.000 --> 41:13.000]  oh, you just don't believe in science.
[41:13.000 --> 41:16.000]  It's like black lives matter, science matters.
[41:16.000 --> 41:19.000]  That's the signs are all over the country.
[41:19.000 --> 41:24.000]  Billboards, people's yards, black lives matter and science is real.
[41:24.000 --> 41:27.000]  It's like, oh yeah, you don't believe in learning immunity, huh?
[41:27.000 --> 41:30.000]  Don't know anything about white blood cells, do you, Alex?
[41:30.000 --> 41:31.000]  Well, it's not just white blood cells.
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  It's T lymphocytes and have been all about it.
[41:33.000 --> 41:34.000]  Yes.
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  And I've literally lived studying this for decades.
[41:36.000 --> 41:39.000]  My mother was a triathlete when she was in her 40s,
[41:39.000 --> 41:43.000]  was winning gold and silver medals at the major regional
[41:43.000 --> 41:44.000]  and national level.
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.000]  She was beating former Olympic athletes.
[41:47.000 --> 41:51.000]  The University of Texas masters told them take those shots.
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  She almost died.
[41:53.000 --> 41:56.000]  Other members of her team got really sick and she never made it
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  back to that level again.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  I don't, I mean, I can read the science, but I can also see my
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  uncle took the tetanus shot, whole arm blew up.
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  He was in the hospital for two weeks, almost died.
[42:06.000 --> 42:09.000]  I was five years old when that happened.
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  He worked on a ranch, stepped on a nail.
[42:11.000 --> 42:15.000]  They said, get another tetanus shot, almost killed my uncle.
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  That's a real person.
[42:17.000 --> 42:20.000]  I got people sitting down here that went to Vietnam a few months ago.
[42:20.000 --> 42:23.000]  They told me all these shots almost killed her.
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.000]  And they told her, you can't ever take a vaccine again because
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  you have the, you have like a bee sting.
[42:28.000 --> 42:31.000]  The next time it could kill you.
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  I know all about learned immunity.
[42:33.000 --> 42:36.000]  I went and got the shots and stuff to, you know, stop allergies
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  and it helped because it was just a little bit of what was
[42:38.000 --> 42:39.000]  really in the environment.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  But I've got an epi-pin when I did it.
[42:41.000 --> 42:44.000]  They're not telling you what it can do to you until it's too late.
[42:44.000 --> 42:47.000]  Then they told her, you can't ever take a shot again.
[42:47.000 --> 42:48.000]  It'll probably kill you.
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  But when your baby has a convulsion, they say bring them right
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  back in and get more.
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  They'll stick your baby in a beehive.
[42:55.000 --> 42:56.000]  Crab them in there.
[42:56.000 --> 42:57.000]  It's good for them.

[47:00.000 --> 47:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:15.000 --> 47:21.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:21.000 --> 47:27.000]  You keep saying you've got something for me.
[47:27.000 --> 47:33.000]  Something you call love, but confess.
[47:33.000 --> 47:38.000]  You've been a messin' where you shouldn't have been a messin'.
[47:38.000 --> 47:41.000]  And now someone else is gettin' on.
[47:41.000 --> 47:45.000]  You know, people ask when I get really frustrated and angry sometimes.
[47:45.000 --> 47:50.000]  There is a admitted declassified worldwide eugenics program
[47:50.000 --> 47:55.000]  that corporations and governments to test deadly chemicals
[47:55.000 --> 47:59.000]  and biologicals on the public to control the population
[47:59.000 --> 48:06.000]  but at the same time use us as guinea pigs in lethal testing
[48:06.000 --> 48:12.000]  to develop super science level drugs and treatments.
[48:12.000 --> 48:16.000]  And of course an example I harp on a lot is you've got all these animal rights laws in place
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.000]  and you've got all these human rights laws in place
[48:19.000 --> 48:22.000]  but they just basically ignore the human rights stuff
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  but then you've got the human animal chimeras by the thousands
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  that have been gestating on labs and being born for 35 years
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.000]  and they just now told us about it last year.
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.000]  Of course I told you about it 22 years ago but it's now public
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  and they have no rights and I've talked to people that have been involved in the labs
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  and they won't get in any details.
[48:44.000 --> 48:49.000]  It is horrifying beyond anything you've ever imagined.
[48:49.000 --> 48:54.000]  So if you think pedophilia and Satanism and all this sexual harassment stuff
[48:54.000 --> 48:59.000]  is even the bottom of the rat hole mutating the whole planet
[48:59.000 --> 49:04.000]  creating horrible genetic abominations
[49:04.000 --> 49:10.000]  is the finger painting of the demon elite that runs this planet.
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  It's like the $50 million ketchup on canvas that went.
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  That's meant to debase art.
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  That's meant to laugh by these big brokerage firms
[49:19.000 --> 49:24.000]  when they pay $100 million for a bucket of horse manure.
[49:24.000 --> 49:27.000]  It's a sick joke that everybody's starving
[49:27.000 --> 49:33.000]  and they're going to fill their house with buckets of horse manure.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  It's saying you're crap.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  I'm going to spend money on this ugly thing.
[49:37.000 --> 49:40.000]  It's blasphemy. It's inversion. It's like killing a baby
[49:40.000 --> 49:43.000]  because I'm selfish and I want to. I'm going to do it.
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  And then that's all declassified.
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  They admit that they started funding this in the 50s
[49:48.000 --> 49:54.000]  to make ugly art force-fed to short circuit people's minds
[49:54.000 --> 49:59.000]  and then play a game with you and say, oh, it's beautifully out of the boulder.
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  That's not my opinion.
[50:01.000 --> 50:06.000]  It's declassified modern architecture, ugliness, all of it.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  Not saying all modern architecture is ugly.
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  Some of the Japanese styles are very beautiful,
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.000]  but it's not really modern. It's simplistic, different term.
[50:14.000 --> 50:17.000]  But the big blockhouses, the big...
[50:17.000 --> 50:20.000]  There it is, independent newspaper, modern art as a CIA weapon.
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  See, because you have to understand, we're here to talk about the engineering.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  They've got blueprints. They've got owner's manuals for us.
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  They talk about what they're doing.
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  They're a bunch of inbred, super rich people
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  that are almost all into Satanism.
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  I know folks that know the top Hollywood people,
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  the top Rockefellers, the top Duponts.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  I know two different people that know the Dupont family.
[50:43.000 --> 50:48.000]  And separately, before I ever talked about it on air, they told me,
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  most of the men are trans. That's the elite thing.
[50:52.000 --> 50:56.000]  And then they're also devil worshipers.
[50:56.000 --> 51:01.000]  And it's just like, whoa!
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.000]  That'll all be.
[51:02.000 --> 51:05.000]  Jones says trans, people are devil worshipers.
[51:05.000 --> 51:08.000]  No, I'm saying what I was told. That's what the whole thing is.
[51:08.000 --> 51:11.000]  It's this hemaphroditic thing. It's like take over the human.
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  Don't be male. Don't be female.
[51:13.000 --> 51:16.000]  Rebelligance creation, rebell against procreation,
[51:16.000 --> 51:20.000]  and their sperm counts are down 90 plus percent.
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  The families are falling apart. It is a war on life.
[51:23.000 --> 51:26.000]  The genetic engineering, the terminator seeds,
[51:26.000 --> 51:28.000]  the don't produce new seeds.
[51:28.000 --> 51:31.000]  All of it is about total corporate domination of the life force,
[51:31.000 --> 51:34.000]  of procreation, and corporate scientific control,
[51:34.000 --> 51:38.000]  where babies are born out of plastic bags that aren't even humans.
[51:38.000 --> 51:40.000]  They're just engineered.
[51:40.000 --> 51:45.000]  And that's full control for the ruling classes that have always wanted that.
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  And then BuzzFeed celebrates, we have low testosterone.
[51:48.000 --> 51:51.000]  We're weird nerds. Our moms all gave us soy.
[51:51.000 --> 51:55.000]  And a lot of these moms are with the program.
[51:55.000 --> 51:59.000]  This is a sacrifice of their son, but not on an altar,
[51:59.000 --> 52:05.000]  but for their life turning them into a pet.
[52:05.000 --> 52:10.000]  It's safer that way, isn't it, to have your son be your pet.
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  And you wonder, they're black, they're white, they're Hispanic.
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.000]  Look at the BuzzFeed video. They all look the same.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  They all look like their souls were sucked,
[52:17.000 --> 52:20.000]  and they all act like four-year-olds.
[52:20.000 --> 52:27.000]  They got hit, and they got hit hard, and they're gone.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  You have to understand, they want you to be gone, too.
[52:30.000 --> 52:32.000]  They know it.
[52:32.000 --> 52:38.000]  I go back to Omega Man in that allegory, where his blood's got the antidote.
[52:38.000 --> 52:42.000]  It's like the last man on earth, a remade, and they had...
[52:42.000 --> 52:44.000]  I am legend.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  It's a third remake, not any good.
[52:46.000 --> 52:51.000]  But you've got the dumb zombies, you've got the uppercast zombies, the undead.
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  And he's got the cure, and they go,
[52:53.000 --> 52:57.000]  we don't want it, and we're going to kill you, okay?
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  You understand?
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  You're not going to give us the cure.
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  We don't want the cure.
[53:03.000 --> 53:08.000]  We don't like you. Do you understand?
[53:08.000 --> 53:11.000]  And it's like a rest of development, and it's a rebellion against God,
[53:11.000 --> 53:14.000]  against nature, against femininity, against masculinity.
[53:14.000 --> 53:18.000]  And they say, see, because they don't have that.
[53:18.000 --> 53:24.000]  What they have is a petulant kind of 13, 14-year-old spoiled rotten thing,
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  where they go out and wear onesies now.
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  Remember that's the new fashion?
[53:27.000 --> 53:31.000]  And I've seen men all over Austin, the trendy, wearing onesies.
[53:31.000 --> 53:32.000]  What do they call them?
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  They have a name for them.
[53:34.000 --> 53:37.000]  Male onesies.
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  And they revel, look, I'm a joke.
[53:39.000 --> 53:40.000]  Look, I've been destroyed.
[53:40.000 --> 53:41.000]  Look, I'm programmed.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  Look, I'm fighting back.
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  I'm rebelling.
[53:45.000 --> 53:52.000]  But they're not rebelling.
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  They're rebelling against their biology.
[53:54.000 --> 54:00.000]  But the central programming system is what's destroying them.
[54:00.000 --> 54:03.000]  And they'll tell you, they're financially not doing well.
[54:03.000 --> 54:04.000]  They're statistically the most depressed.
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  They're committing suicide at high levels.
[54:06.000 --> 54:07.000]  They don't care.
[54:07.000 --> 54:12.000]  They just want to take you with them.
[54:12.000 --> 54:15.000]  Listen, I've got the cure.
[54:15.000 --> 54:16.000]  It's right here.
[54:16.000 --> 54:17.000]  It's called reality.
[54:17.000 --> 54:18.000]  It's called the plan.
[54:18.000 --> 54:20.000]  It's called being aware of the engineering.
[54:20.000 --> 54:23.000]  It's called understanding.
[54:23.000 --> 54:27.000]  Choosing your destiny, not having someone else choose it for you.
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  And they say, I don't want that.
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  I'm going to get together in big groups of us.
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  And we're all going to conquer you.
[54:34.000 --> 54:37.000]  And that, substantially, is how you become powerful.
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.000]  In mass groups, conquering the original biology,
[54:42.000 --> 54:45.000]  that you live longer, you're stronger, you're better.
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  It doesn't matter, though.
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  You don't care.
[54:47.000 --> 54:50.000]  If you could conquer that, you see,
[54:50.000 --> 54:53.000]  your facsimiles of the elites you are trying to mimic,
[54:53.000 --> 54:54.000]  who are not the elites.
[54:54.000 --> 54:55.000]  They are the elite of evil.
[54:55.000 --> 54:56.000]  They are the elite of corruption.
[54:56.000 --> 54:57.000]  They are just like you.
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  They were given their wealth over and over and over again.
[54:59.000 --> 55:00.000]  They're spoiled.
[55:00.000 --> 55:01.000]  They hate flyover country.
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  They hate men that are bigger and stronger than them.
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  They want to walk around the mall when they go,
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  knowing they're part of the engineering,
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  knowing they're hitting you with vaccines,
[55:09.000 --> 55:10.000]  knowing they're poisoning you.
[55:10.000 --> 55:11.000]  They know it.
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.000]  They write books about it.
[55:12.000 --> 55:13.000]  They brag about it.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  You don't just think they want to humiliate women
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  like Harvey Weinstein does or be pedophiles, do you?
[55:17.000 --> 55:21.000]  They want to wreck it all, and they're doing it.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  I'm not going to belabor this,
[55:23.000 --> 55:26.000]  but we need a lot of capital to fund this operation.
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  And we need people to spread the word.
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  We've got a new T-shirt in that I really think is powerful.
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  It says, if you're coming for mine, you better have yours.
[55:34.000 --> 55:39.000]  And it's got an M4 or AR-15 on the front, m4wars.com.
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.000]  On the right shoulder, it's at m4warstore.com.
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  It's a powerful new shirt.
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  It helps you spread the word, meet like-minded folks,
[55:47.000 --> 55:48.000]  m4warstore.com.
[55:48.000 --> 55:52.000]  And we have the new probiotics in that are not the vegan base,
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  like the Great Bound Defense we have as well,
[55:54.000 --> 55:58.000]  but carnivore digestive enzyme to help absorb the meat, the protein,
[55:58.000 --> 56:01.000]  the fat, all of it, the carbohydrates.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  Amazing, as you get older, you have less of these enzymes.
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  And so it's really, really good to do that carnivore.
[56:07.000 --> 56:08.000]  33% off.
[56:08.000 --> 56:09.000]  And the free shipping will end.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  You notice a bunch of the other specials have ended
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.000]  on Super Mill Vitale and all those, because they're about to sell out.
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  But I've extended free shipping through Sunday,
[56:16.000 --> 56:17.000]  and that's got to stop.
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  It is going to stop.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  But we've got other things that are now 50% off.
[56:21.000 --> 56:26.000]  Caveman got back in stock in strawberry and in chocolate flavor.
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  Ultimate Paleo formula, amazing.
[56:28.000 --> 56:31.000]  Mille replacements, stamina, strength, you name it.
[56:31.000 --> 56:32.000]  Get 50% off.
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  33% off on carnivore, the new digestive enzyme.
[56:35.000 --> 56:38.000]  We've got fluorolive advanced restoration,
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  50 million live probiotics.
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  That is back in stock.
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  And we also have the new 15 million live probiotic,
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  fluorolive everyday maintenance.
[56:48.000 --> 56:52.000]  Made by the biggest official organic producer we've probably labeled
[56:52.000 --> 56:55.000]  with our own particular latest souped up brew.
[56:55.000 --> 56:58.000]  Again, they've killed all the good bacteria in most people's guts
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  with the pesticides that bio accumulate in the food.
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  You take the good probiotics, it's amazing.
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  And this is something libertarians and conservatives,
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  this is something liberals have been smart about, actually.
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  They're the highest group, not vaccinated.
[57:08.000 --> 57:09.000]  They know what they're doing.
[57:09.000 --> 57:12.000]  That's more of the brain bug, uppercast of them do.
[57:12.000 --> 57:13.000]  Not their low level ones.
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  But you notice they're the ones that avoid it like the plague.
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.000]  The point is, it will change your life so good for the gut.
[57:18.000 --> 57:21.000]  I know some people that have that irritable bowel, you name it.
[57:21.000 --> 57:24.000]  They get on a high quality probiotic.
[57:24.000 --> 57:29.000]  Like fluorolive, or like biomedefense.infowarstore.com.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  And it just does so much.
[57:30.000 --> 57:33.000]  We've now got three different great probiotics.
[57:33.000 --> 57:34.000]  One of them is vegan.
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  These other two aren't obviously in the enzyme isn't.
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  It's carnalife.
[57:37.000 --> 57:41.000]  It's meant to break down the protein and fat in your stomach better.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  It's just an amazing thing.
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  So please support us today and get great products you need.

[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  digestion and intestinal function.
[58:21.000 --> 58:24.000]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop

[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  We've been testing this formula for years,
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  but this is the limited first run to the public.
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  So please take advantage of it today, support your own health
[58:44.000 --> 58:48.000]  and support the infowar.
[58:48.000 --> 58:52.000]  America is an information based civil war.
[58:52.000 --> 58:53.000]  That's why now more than ever,
[58:53.000 --> 58:55.000]  we've got to hit the streets of America
[58:55.000 --> 58:57.000]  and let these globalists scum know
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  we're not backing down from their bullying.
[58:59.000 --> 59:03.000]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  wannabe dictatorship.
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  Being a conservative, a nationalist,
[59:07.000 --> 59:11.000]  a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  is truly the counterculture.
[59:13.000 --> 59:16.000]  The real punk rock is being a patriot
[59:16.000 --> 59:19.000]  who's pro-America, pro-capitalism and pro-freedom
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  who at the same time is tolerant.
[59:21.000 --> 59:24.000]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of
[59:24.000 --> 59:27.000]  Thomas Geverson's classical liberalism.
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  They are the anti-liberalists.
[59:29.000 --> 59:32.000]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends
[59:32.000 --> 59:33.000]  and promote freedom worldwide.
[59:33.000 --> 59:36.000]  We've got more than 60 original designs
[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  of high quality t-shirts for men and women,
[59:39.000 --> 59:42.000]  as well as more Patriot Feral at infowarstore.com.
[59:42.000 --> 59:45.000]  Be part of the Second American Revolution
[59:45.000 --> 59:47.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[59:51.000 --> 59:54.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:54.000 --> 59:58.000]  From the front lines of the information war,
[59:58.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  He only did.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  It is so frustrating.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  I rarely start cussing and screaming,
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000]  but when I was lifting weights this morning
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  in my garage with a couple of my friends,
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  I heard from a friend who just talked to his wife
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.000]  that she was talking about taking their six-month-old baby
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.000]  that she already snuck off to the so-called doctor
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  and got six different shots for her
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]  when he was about five months old and he got sick from it.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  Not too sick, but she was going to take him
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  and give him the flu shot.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:21.000]  And, you know, obviously a father can go in any state
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  and block that, or a mother.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  But more and more, we've got videos.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  I forgot to play this the other day.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  In fact, they had it over there on the other side.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  Smile, find it.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000]  It's the police going.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  It's the law.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  We're going to arrest you if you don't take your shot.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Come into your house.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  And I've seen them do that in poor black, Hispanic,
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  and white areas.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  Pardon me?
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.000]  Oh, you've got it.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  Let's play it then.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  And I remember footage in Maryland years ago.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000]  They had dogs.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  And all the people were showing me their shots.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  And the judge was telling them it was the law.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  They had to do it.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  And it was all made up.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  Young mother in California threatened with arrest
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  at a bus stop for not vaccinating her children.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  We lose this battle.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  What just happened to that young mother in California
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  will soon start happening all over the nation.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  And what they do is they say,
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  we're going to kick you out if you don't have it.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  It's a policy.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.000]  Then they claim you're truing.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  So it's all a color of law trick.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]  And they teach them this at seminars.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Well, it's for the best that we lie.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  Despite the fact that I have a stack of news here
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  from government reports, studies about miscarriages,
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000]  brain damage, but it doesn't protect you like it says it will.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  And then now Google Bing and others place
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  all the fake news articles at the top
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  and it won't even let you actually read the inserts.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  They've always known vaccines are linked to miscarriages.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  They knew the anthrax vaccine was super dangerous.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  I called the police department to make a complaint
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  for harassment was told to the sergeant
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  that me not giving my kids shots is a criminal act.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  And I will be arrested.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  That's Claremont School.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000]  But it's not criminal.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  Here's that video.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  What your position is at Claremont School District
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  and I'm asking these questions.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  What is your position?
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]  I'm asking the question.
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  I'm not answering any questions until I know who you are.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  I don't know who you are.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  Who are you? Give me a card.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  I don't know who you are.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  What is your position, ma'am?
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:05.000]  Thank you very much, ma'am.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  I don't know who this man is.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  He came with the Claremont Police Department
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  to make sure, I guess,
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  to treat my six-year-old like a criminal
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  because I don't know
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  to make sure he doesn't have any immunizations.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  I am recording this because this is harassment.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  I am embarrassed that I have
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  walked my kids to the school.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  The bus stopped this morning and they have harassed me.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  I don't know who this man is.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000]  He has not identified himself.
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  Excuse me, ma'am. Excuse me.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  What is your name? Can I have your card?
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  The officer refused
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  to give her name.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  The officer refused to give her card.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:41.000]  I have no idea who these people are.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  Life is a matter, folks.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  And you see what you just witnessed right there.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  They come to the bus stop to tell her
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  it's illegal, you've got to give your kids shots.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  They call, the sergeant says, that's right,
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:53.000]  you're going to go to jail. Total lie,
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  total fraud,
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  total racketeering.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  That's why now more than ever,
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]  we've got to hit the streets of America
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  and let these globalists scum know
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000]  we're not backing down from their bullying.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  Being a conservative, a nationalist,
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  is truly the counterculture.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]  The real punk rock is being a patriot
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000]  who's pro-America, pro-capitalism,
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]  of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000]  They are the anti-liberals
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000]  who defend free speech, meet like-minded friends,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]  and promote freedom worldwide.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  We've got more than 60 original designs
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000]  of high-quality t-shirts for men and women,
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:51.000]  as well as more Patriot Feral at infowarstore.com.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]  Be part of the Second American Revolution
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:15.000]  at infowarstore.com.
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:34.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  You know, I've spent much of the last hour on vaccines.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000]  And on the fact that the sperm count is down over 90%,
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]  testosterone is down over 50%,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000]  Europe-wide, Japan-wide, Brazil-wide, US-wide,
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000]  anywhere that eats a modern soy-based
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  or glyphosate-based diet,
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]  because glyphosate bioaccumulates
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]  in all the major crops that use it.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  It basically is estrogen, chemical,
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  and breaks down into several different types
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000]  of estrogen mimicers.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  And so, you know, the New York Times says 50%,
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  since the 1970s, it's far worse than that.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000]  They're always whitewashing them all
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  when you get into the actual reports.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  This is happening.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  And the soy and the vaccines and the fluoride,
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  I mean, folks, fluoride's one of the most studied things
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  in the last 200 years of modern science.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000]  And they know that hydrofluorosalic acid
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  is a weaponized, souped-up, electrified acid base.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  You stick your hand in hydrofluorosalic acid,
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  pull it out, it's like rubber and falls off.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  It's one of the most deadly acids out there.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  It's right up there with hydrochloric.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000]  Hydrochloric acid.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  And when they put it in water,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  it becomes an adjuvant.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  It carries everything through the blood-brain barrier.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  You get a little bit of hydrofluorosalic acid.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  Everything else, they're adding to the water.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]  Believe me, they're adding a lot of blood on purpose.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000]  It's then souped-up to put as much in.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  It's the delivery system.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  So when we say fluoride's causing 15-point IQ reductions,
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]  if you just drink it, what is it?
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  The Harvard study was three years when you're a child.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  Oh, but they have it, even after that came out years ago.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  Oh, fluoride water for babies.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  It's for your babies.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  I wonder how CNN feels now that it's come out.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  They had to report it lower IQ in children
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  if you drink it just while you're pregnant.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  So that's why I'm so frustrated,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  is that I have just today stacks of news government documents
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  where, oh, here's one they admit the government knew
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  that anthrax vaccine wasn't going to help you
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  and was hurting the troops.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  They've only known that for 25 years.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  You can't find an immunity for something you can't kill.
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  You can't kill anthrax unless you put it in an incinerator.
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  You can't radiate it and then shoot it into somebody
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  and then wonder why they get anthrax.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  Gee, we gave this to 500 people
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:23.000]  and these five platoons or whatever
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  and bunch of them have got big sores all over them
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  and they're bleeding out of them.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  It's anthrax. You got anthrax.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.000]  Ha!
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  And they weren't giving them the anthrax shots.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  I'm going to tell you this again.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  To protect you from it,
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  they wanted to see how it would mutate in your body.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  With different batches they did different things to.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  They manipulated the anthrax,
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000]  did a live genetic mutagen test on you
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  and that's now come out.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]  They were getting the blood from the troops
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  for advanced research into life extension
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  because they want to know why certain cell lines will not die.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  Will not die.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  There are animal cells and there are plant cells
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  that can live millions of years in hibernation.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  And they're finding all sorts of new species
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  and all sorts of new types in the rocks.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  Remember they always thought,
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  oh, you need light to live.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  No, they got mines in South Africa that are three miles deep
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  and they're digging into rock that's just full of microbes.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  They don't even know what they are.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:45.000]  We might dig into something that kills us all.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  But I sure know it's not good to take it and go,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  let's give it to a million troops.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  Yeah, that's a great idea.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  And then take their blood and see what it does.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  Black people syphilis are radiating little kids
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  in the 50s, 60s and 70s and 80s.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  Do you think they stopped now?
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000]  They didn't stop any of it.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  Just the secret testing alone.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  See, I've got so much news to cover here today
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  but I just got to get mad about this
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  and it upsets me so much.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  I'm going to say it again and I'm going to see all the news.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  You know, they just pulled up an Arctic thaw
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  with a bunch of anthrax that's down in ISIS.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  Millions of years old.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  Arctic thaw threatens early superbugs from hibernation.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  Well, I'm sure if you inject all the troops with it,
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  I mean, you know, the Navy dug up the Spanish flu
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  that killed 40 million people.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  Remember the SV-40 vaccine they had six, seven years ago?
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  They put an attenuated version of that in there.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  It came out in the medical literature.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  You know, that's the crazy part is
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  they go the year before the H1N1 mount break.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  We put a simulant into that year's vaccine.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  And I'm like reading this in medical journals
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  where they admit they were jacking with it
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  and put a simulant.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  That means another attenuated virus in it.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  And yes, you attenuate, you radiate, you fry, you cut up.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  Viruses, they tend to not operate as well.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  Just like you put a cell phone up against your head,
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  it vibrates the DNA and breaks it as well.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  That's what they do.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  They blast them with radiation or with microwaves
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  or with both, and then they inject it into you.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  And just like a lot of insects are immune to poison,
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  you may kill 9% of them, but that 1% was already immune.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  They were a mutation.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.000]  You start giving billions of people mutinogenic vaccines
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  and you know full well what you're doing.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  And you're there to get their blood work afterwards
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  and patent the blood.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  You know, they've for about 45 years
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.000]  been taking everybody's blood at birth,
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  putting it in a database.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.000]  I learned about it from a nurse,
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  the secret government program that we exposed
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  and it later became mainstream news.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  I'm credited with that.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  I'm just pointing that out.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.000]  And then they took the blood
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:15.000]  and they sold it to big companies.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  And the companies then patented your genes
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  and your unique protein factors.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  And then people are going to get gene therapy
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.000]  and they're going,
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  sorry, we do have a gene treatment for you,
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  but 22 years ago, this company or that company
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  bought your blood and patented you.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  And there have been court cases
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]  and the federal courts have said both,
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  the companies own you and other cases have said they don't.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  And you've got genetic therapies that they go,
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  that'll be $180,000 per treatment.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  And there's 100% cure rate.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  You've got to have 10 treatments
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  and your insurance doesn't cover it
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  because we bought your blood sample.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  Now that's just from at birth.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  Can you imagine the military application of that?
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  You see something hundreds of times bigger
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]  than the Manhattan Project.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  People's blood taken at birth
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000]  so they can know your genetics
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  and they can manipulate your genetics
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:10.000]  and they can use your genetics
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  and they can now re-sequence them
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  with a gene editor that they had 30 years ago
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  they just told you about last week, literally,
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:25.000]  that they then inject directly into live species.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  And you're going to trust them.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  It's all a trust thing.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:31.000]  I told you there's a pediatric place
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  that I won't take my children to anymore,
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  but when you first went there,
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  you know, you'd be searching in vaccine pediatricians
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]  that don't make you vaccinate,
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  and I went and found the place
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  and the guy owned a big, big clinic in town.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  He was retiring about 10 years ago
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  and he walked over to me
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  and I brought my son and daughter in
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  for a checkup and he goes,
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  you know, I've worked in the city clinic
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  like you're supposed to for continued education.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  You got to do things like that.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.000]  He goes, we were given kids a few years ago
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.000]  and he starts to 1960s live polio vaccine
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  that had SV 40 cancer virus in it.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  And he goes, and I refuse to do it,
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  but they continue to do it
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.000]  and they continue to do it to this day.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  And I said, that's incredible.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.000]  And he grabs him by the arm.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  He's a big guy.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  He goes, don't you ever tell anybody I told you that.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  And I said, hey, man, I already know that.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.000]  Okay.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  I already know.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  Don't worry.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  Now he's been retired.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  I walk there on my new baby.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:32.000]  Nurse walks over.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  Doctor walks over.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000]  She goes, you get your stuff and you get out of here.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]  There are no problems with vaccines.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  They're perfect.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  Of course, she's been in the training.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  I even know the training.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  Go watch it online to lie to me and say that.
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  And I said, guess what?
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  We're going to beat you.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  I know you don't take them out.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000]  You don't give your kids.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  They're lucky.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  I don't get out in front of the bullhorn.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.000]  I'm thinking about it.
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  That's the scum here.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000]  They don't take it.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  The highest educated doesn't.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.

[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:49.880]  you the very best at the lowest price when you purchase it and infowarslives.com you know you
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:20:15.000]  are also financing the attack on the globalist and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[01:20:20.120 --> 01:20:45.640]  Now here's an example of the quandary we're in or the paradox they've got more than 30 micro
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:52.600]  aggressions they teach at universities just on sexism that if you tell a woman she looks nice
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:21:00.440]  that's a form of harassment or if somebody ever asks you out period even if you're not even
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:07.000]  you know working with them or whatever that that somehow is a micro aggression or it's the same thing
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:15.960]  they say if you tell a black person that they look good or something they said was really cool or
[01:21:15.960 --> 01:21:22.360]  that they did a great job well that's patronizing that's the same deal uh no it's it's like it's
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:28.120]  like Brandon Tatum gets 70 million views on one video that's because he nailed it like a hole in
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:35.480]  the one more eloquent than I could ever be that's saying this is really good but see that's where they
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:42.840]  make all the fight about and did a guy ask a girl out versus Harvey Weinstein literally
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:49.000]  reportedly raping people show fur others witnessed this assaulting women almost every day
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:55.960]  humiliating them bill clinton settling rape cases all of this so I got a lot of stuff I want to talk
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:00.440]  to her about but I just thought of this when they punched her up on Skype and I saw her there
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:04.680]  and I was going to say wow Candace Owens looks great on TV she's even more beautiful in person
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:08.760]  and super smart and super articulate and she looks really great today it's good to see her face
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:13.320]  I'm married I'm not hitting on her and it's not I don't think it's a micro aggression to say wow you
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:18.760]  look great I mean is it is that bad because the left says that's bad just as bad as raping somebody
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:25.240]  is it it is not that bad and I do not understand why people are suddenly so offended by compliments
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:30.760]  I I really think it's just like the ugly girls strike back movement and they don't get compliments
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:36.360]  so they've turned compliments into something that is not to be desired I don't subscribe to it oh
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:40.600]  yeah some women act like I'm a pervert or something because I open a door for them I did that because
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:43.560]  when I was growing up I got slapped in the back of the head but my mother if I didn't it's just
[01:22:43.560 --> 01:22:50.200]  automatic yeah I know that's the that's the most hilarious part when guys are being chivalrous
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:55.160]  and they now turn it into an active attack it's it's so ridiculous it's gotten so ridiculous
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:23:00.040]  on the last but they can't enjoy anything not a compliment not a kind gesture it's just where
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:04.440]  we're at with them at this point and they admit millennials you name it are the most depressed
[01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:07.880]  unhappy people statistically you'd think they'd want to get out of what they're in instead of
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:13.160]  getting deeper into it uh you would think so but that doesn't seem to be the case and they're
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:16.840]  miserable they're absolutely miserable because they've sucked the fun I talk about this all the
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:22.680]  time liberals have sucked the fun out of everything in life there's nothing left for them to suck the
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:26.680]  fun out of which is why they're miserable they have nothing else to leech on to exactly I want
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:32.280]  to get your take on this why do you think it's all coming out now the the internet chain reaction
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.680]  people feel safe now but but there's you know there's more to that because mainstream media
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:42.280]  has embraced this even though it's burning down their own system I think they know it's time
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:47.480]  to actually get rid of the old democrat guard and then hope that they can roll this into a larger
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:54.920]  movement to again conflate or mix men and women having normal interactions with rape culture
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:24:02.120]  you know I think it really boils down to politics I think that it's just a strategy for them to cast
[01:24:02.120 --> 01:24:06.600]  the light on people a negative light on people that they don't want to see there and what's
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:12.120]  happening is the right is using the same tactics to fight back so now we're kind of in this civil
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:16.600]  war of people talking about what is or what isn't sexual assault and what ultimately comes down to
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:21.480]  as a democrat to the ones that first shifted that definition right I was talking about it with Owen
[01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:26.440]  yesterday but initially when I learned about rape it was like hardcore rape it's somebody
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:30.760]  slipping something into your drink at you running down an alley from a stranger and
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:35.080]  you know them trying something you're gonna call the cops for I mean if assaults real I got three
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:40.040]  daughters I got a son somebody sexually assaults you or grabs you call the police I mean if it's
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.280]  serious what is assault what is rape what is harassment it call the police is what it is
[01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:50.120]  right exactly but the definition has shifted so much and now it can be like you just said a
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:55.640]  compliment it can be guys and girls looking up in college they're drunk and they after party they go
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:59.400]  and they have sex and the girl wakes up in the morning and regrets it or doesn't remember all
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:04.200]  of it so now she's being taught and indoctrinated with the idea that this is sexual assault and
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:08.600]  rape and that could not be more false and that movement and that change definition is extremely
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:15.160]  harmful not just for men but for women as well it's it's turning women into over analyzing
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:19.000]  psychopaths and I should have introduced you properly just you were here for a few days got
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:22.040]  to know you went out to dinner with you and the crew so she's like you're talking to an old friend
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:27.800]  again Candace Owens with red pill black and her experience as a liberal as a mainline feminist
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:32.280]  being inducted you know into their cult briefly was what woke her up what was really going on is
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:37.800]  that a fair way to say it or are them trying to induct you in right no so what I always say is that
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.120]  I was a liberal but I was more of a it's almost like a sleep hypnosis like I wasn't active I was
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:46.680]  never out there wearing a pussy hat there was no ideas even of mine that were technically liberal
[01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:51.000]  but because I'm black and from the time that we are put in school we the way that we are even taught
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.280]  our history is biased and it's all a lie they make us think democrats are the hero they make you
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.520]  think that you cannot think anything outside of the fact that you are a democrat that indoctrination
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:05.400]  happens in our youth and we carry it with us we go to college you learn the exact same thing
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:10.280]  and it's a it's a mass brainwashing so if you're not paying attention to politics which is the case
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:14.280]  for the majority of the black community we aren't paying attention we're too busy trying to feed
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:18.920]  mouths or for me was payback student loans and you just go oh yes you're on the democrat
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:23.640]  but when you start paying attention and here is my theory every single black person is a
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:28.520]  conservative and when they find out how we have been lied to and manipulated by not just the media
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:32.520]  but the democrats most especially what they have done to us it is going to be hell for them
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:37.000]  it's just crazy too when you learn the democrats know what they're doing like the
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.640]  group of feminists that you let her expose we're the ones harassing you to then be the savior
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:47.240]  i mean it's a cult they know what they're doing they're just cold-blooded absolutely they're cold
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:57.400]  blooded they do not care marketing um and it is it's ugly it's just gotten absolutely ugly and i
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:01.960]  think black people are waking up to it and i pay if i'm anything to help it's going to be hell for
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:07.320]  the democrats by 2020 absolutely and for the republican rhinos that are the very same type of
[01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:11.800]  you so-called blue blood elites what do you make because we're gonna break and come back to overall
[01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:19.240]  this what do you make of the domino effect though because it is just crazy a dims reckoning with bill
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:25.560]  sexual offenses is the final nail in the coffin i mean this is the democrats and people saying this
[01:27:25.560 --> 01:27:31.320]  dim senator bill clinton should have resigned following louinsky scandal they're saying
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.240]  franken should resign and you know i'd say well if there wasn't the photo of him grabbing her
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:38.440]  breast he's clearly doing it and he didn't have a history of this more women are coming forward
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:43.160]  i'd say wait and see but with him we have the smoking gun people say well why did trump talk
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:48.360]  about this and not more it's smoking gun the photo but i think i think you know you know the more
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:52.120]  thing's pretty creepy i'm gonna get your take on that fact let's let's cover that now what do
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.320]  you think about the roi morton because i don't care that he happens to be a republican if this
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:28:00.360]  stuff's true i'll throw him under the bus in two seconds right absolutely so i will say that some
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:05.480]  of the facts surrounding this are extremely shady i i tend to agree with the fact that the hand writing
[01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:10.920]  doesn't match um so that is a little shady obviously the timing of the complaints no matter
[01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:17.160]  you know you're you're making some great points we're gonna reconnect with you on skype because
[01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:21.560]  it's breaking up a little bit we're gonna come back to kandace owens a red pill black on the other
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:27.320]  side and that's where i stand on more if somebody's guilty of something but the prosecution tries to
[01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:31.960]  set him up the whole case is thrown out and we've got women that are democrats that are backing down
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:36.600]  or or who've been caught working for the uh other candidate we've got handwriting doesn't match we've
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.520]  got weird testimony we got the mall saying this stuff never happened he wasn't throwing out he
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.800]  wasn't throwing women but then you got him saying i did date 17 year olds and i got their daddy's
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:52.120]  permission i just think that's a little creepy but is it illegal no it's just the politicians this

[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:20.040]  and it's about three weeks ago spent a few days in austin my wife and i and the crew
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:23.800]  i would destroy her and others took her out to dinner it's a place called the russia house
[01:33:23.800 --> 01:33:28.840]  it's actually russian food and they've actually got some clothes you can put on as a joke there so
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:34.280]  we donned some russian outfits and shot this joke video that ended up airing on some us news
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:38.920]  as if we were serious and in russia as if it was a joke which it was meant no this is not
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:45.240]  proof of our russia collusion here it is we pledge allegiance to comrade putin and his great
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:51.880]  minion donald j trump to make america great again we pledge this plan to destroy the americans to
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:58.120]  save their economy and their people and their border and their military hail putin hail russia
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:18.760]  we will never surrender we didn't force canis to be part of that she was sitting one down for my
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:24.360]  wife but you know i'm never good at really promoting things that are huge news well the
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:29.800]  reason canis was coming on i kind of just got off onto the judge roi mortang and the big sex
[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:34.520]  scandal stuff this is an example of is it bad as tell a woman she looks nice or tell a man your
[01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:38.200]  suit looks good i mean if i see a guy wearing a suit looks good here at the office go man who's
[01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:42.840]  your tailor you know that that looks sharp that's a nice car i mean this is not harassment to talk
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:49.320]  to people and she's going to get into that but i forgot the main reason she's on this is so huge
[01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:55.480]  and this is such documentation of censorship just two weeks ago in congress they said paul watson's
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:35:00.280]  articles number one on twitter about the islamist's plan on the car of her people and how the mayor
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:04.360]  knew and was warned which was in the news he'd been warned obviously that islamic attacks are
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:10.360]  coming using cars they said sir we saw it at lunch during the break and we banned it now that was
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:17.800]  twitter and facebook both nodding you know that they dealt with it but here it is this is hers
[01:35:17.800 --> 01:35:23.800]  can my children be friends with white people this came out november 11th we covered it last week we
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:32.440]  mentioned this week i mean it is the craziest condescending article i've ever seen she talked
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:38.520]  about it and linked to it and then they're so politically correct and they're so censoring her
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:42.920]  because she is a musical shea smart powerful good-looking black woman what they really fear
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:49.800]  none of their plantation they banned her they froze her account we removed something you posted
[01:35:50.520 --> 01:35:57.720]  this is from her account and this is her response back to them and again this will do they attack us
[01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:02.440]  and then when we respond back they didn't stop the new york times from posting this or linking to it
[01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:08.760]  no you can't respond back in fact i've noticed this that a lot of folks will criticize nazis now
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:13.240]  and make connections to islam and how islam helped the nazis in world war two it's a fact
[01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:19.160]  we've had that blocked everybody else post the emom of jerusalem and others with hitler they go oh
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:24.360]  we don't let you promote nazism that's like saying pbs can't air a documentary about hitler you're
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:29.720]  promoting it see how they play these games so can this goes this is racist to say white people are
[01:36:29.720 --> 01:36:35.000]  inherently bad and they don't want her a black woman responding to it pulling back the curtain
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:40.200]  that's all i am or she has a little toto pull back the curtain that the power of truth and they
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:45.240]  they they blocked her they suspended her as punishment and they've told us they said you
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:48.680]  keep doing what you're doing you'll be totally banned there and they're giving us a they still
[01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:53.640]  haven't done it i talked to him last week the head of the brand quote of this is high level
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:59.480]  it you execs alex don't work with us we're gonna ban you don't say we didn't warn you so again
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:05.800]  kandace oh once we got you uh connected back now your skype's better go over this for radio
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:12.280]  listeners that can't see it how amazing this is well what's really particularly fascinating if you
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:17.240]  see that they say that they're banning me because they i violated the policy and they don't allow
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:22.920]  people to attack people based on their race that is why i got banned from facebook okay well the
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:27.640]  article i was linking to was quite literally attacking people based on their race so they
[01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:31.160]  were fine with the article existing they were fine with the article being shared on facebook
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:35.800]  they were not fine with me taking a satirical stab a hyperbolic approach taking a look at
[01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:40.600]  what this article was saying essentially this article was advocating for segregation it was
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:45.000]  pro-syrogation they even asked the question can my children be friends with white people could you
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:50.840]  imagine how the heads would turn if and culture wrote a piece entitled can my children be friends
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:55.560]  with black people could you just imagine imagine how that would be perceived how violently that would
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:37:59.960]  be perceived on the left but when i take the article and i say yeah you know you're basically
[01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:06.520]  advocating for segregation okay and i use sarcasm and humor they put me on suspension not the
[01:38:06.520 --> 01:38:10.520]  author of the article not the new york times page for having the balls even air something like that
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:15.000]  they put me on suspension and it goes back to what you said they don't like to be a black person
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:21.400]  criticizing calling out racism and as we know and as we've learned racism is totally fine as long as
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:26.600]  it's being geared towards white people well that's the game they play where you show the emom of
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:31.560]  jerusalem with hitler and they say we're not going to let you promote hitler and they know full well
[01:38:31.560 --> 01:38:38.120]  you're showing history you're exposing it it's a fact i mean you can even see you know hollywood
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:42.360]  movies about world war two and the and the and the arab's working with the nazis or i guess they're
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:47.240]  going to have to ban raiders the lost ark i mean it's fiction but it's based in north africa that
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:52.840]  the nazis occupied with the muslims inviting them in and i mean i'm just stating a fact that every
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:58.040]  major muslim country backed up behind adolf hitler that is a historic fact i'm not promoting hitler
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:04.520]  same thing you're showing some blackout race baiting guy selling all this white guilt saying
[01:39:04.520 --> 01:39:08.280]  here's what you got to do it's not enough to be you know a mixed couple it's not enough to be
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:12.840]  liberal it's not you got to adopt whatever we say or i'm not going to let you in the end club
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:17.960]  that is literally like like like jim crow laws but as you said reversed or the or the white golf
[01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:22.760]  course that won't let blacks join i mean this is next level what do you think's behind it
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:28.600]  self-imposed segregation is what we're taking a look at what's behind it is the democratic party
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:31.800]  this is kind of always in their initiative they pretend they're helping black people
[01:39:31.800 --> 01:39:36.120]  now they're creating safe spaces black people are creating their own safe spaces i forgot what
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:41.560]  college this was and it's a bunch of it a bunch of them created safe spaces in all black dorm
[01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:47.720]  okay that is literally segregation self-imposed segregation is everything that malcolm x and
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:52.920]  mlk fought again okay and now black people are willingly imposing it on themselves
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:57.880]  in the name of being safe it makes absolutely no sense and they actually haven't thought through
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:03.080]  the fact that we are going completely backwards in terms of our progress and that's because media
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:07.000]  is constantly feeding this narrative they're constantly race beating they're constantly
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:11.480]  trying to separate the races they're constantly trying to create these conflicts and some people
[01:40:11.480 --> 01:40:15.640]  are biting on it some people that are absolutely sleeping in brainwashed are biting on this ridiculous
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:20.840]  narrative i'm not one of them so i am continually silent it's always going to be an uphill climb
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:24.120]  with me because i don't plan on shutting up i'm going to keep saying what i have to say and i'm
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:28.600]  going to keep calling up the media and in this case the new york times but they're absolute bs
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:34.680]  that's right and expanding on that i knew when i saw it a month and a half ago that whole
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:40.600]  air force cadet thing was timed uh by the deep state and the nfl was all being coordinated
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:49.480]  it was all totally fake just to create division we are living in a time of propaganda it amazes
[01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:53.640]  me that so many people learn about propaganda in school that's the number one thing we learn
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:59.560]  about yellow journalism we learn about hitler and we answer the questions to these tests
[01:40:59.560 --> 01:41:04.200]  positively yes this is propaganda where hitler does propaganda but we are unable to apply that
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:11.320]  logic when we are existing in an era of propaganda people don't understand it we're going to come
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:15.320]  back again and hopefully do a couple more segments if you've got time again red pill black folks you
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:20.280]  need to follow her on twitter on facebook everywhere because she's got a kind of hopscotch back and
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:26.360]  forth on different platforms that's how you beat them you stay on the platforms you force them to
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:33.800]  censor you you force them to ban you because you decry uh the new york times writing this yes this is
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:38.040]  an actual article that appeared in the new york times my response is no your children should
[01:41:38.040 --> 01:41:42.760]  not be friends with white people in fact avoid them at all costs best not mingle might be better
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:47.800]  idea we separated things from the whites all together this is your quoting from the article
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:53.160]  and they're saying no you're bad but the new york times is allowed to have it tweet it and they
[01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:57.800]  tweeted it they put it then it's all praised but then when you point out it's racist they use the
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:42:05.160]  race label to shut you down it's it's it's beyond 1984 right it is and then me taking a satirical
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:09.160]  stab and adding to the article and saying yeah go ahead separate the kids and where are we going to
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:13.560]  end up right back in the center but that's what he says in the article you're basically paraphrasing
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:19.400]  him right exactly that that's the critique is what upsets them someone endorsing it in this in
[01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:23.640]  this megaphone hyperbolic white is what upsets them and it's ridiculous it's absolutely ridiculous
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:28.120]  that writers should be embarrassed they ever put that forth and people in the black community to
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:31.640]  speak out against it and that's what i did all right let's come back and get into whatever you
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:37.320]  want to get into you got a lot to say a lot to cover and then i want to get back into the avalanche

[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:58.040]  we've got a new t-shirt and a couple new t-shirts that don't tread on me that's i think a very
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:03.800]  powerful design and then a new one uh one of our security guys had the idea for if you're coming
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:11.240]  for mine you better bring yours with a picture of a m4 ar-15 a great new shirt i haven't seen that
[01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:18.200]  variant but there it is a brand new deal on don't tread on me and for my cold dead hands basically
[01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:22.360]  okay getting back to kandace owens kandace you've got the floor down for the rest of this segment
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:27.240]  the next i know you've got a lot of important points that you like to point out that you like to make
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:31.080]  so what else is on your radar and if you want to get back into the whole judge roy more thing you
[01:51:31.080 --> 01:51:36.760]  got cut off by break uh yeah no so i think uh one thing that i definitely want to talk about and i
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:41.400]  keep saying that people are not talking enough about it and i'm excluding you because i think
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:44.680]  that you're one of those people that has always kind of seen through this because you've been a
[01:51:44.680 --> 01:51:51.240]  victim of it but the psychology of trolling is quite impressive online on twitter in particular
[01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:58.120]  that they can make up a lie right give credence to the lie and impact something like sean hannity
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:52:02.440]  show and advertisement dollars these are troll accounts that have this much power and that we
[01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:06.920]  get credence to and like you said they you know we're emailing you oh canis this canis is that
[01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:11.240]  obviously you've been through the ringer you've seen the lies on social media they mostly were
[01:52:11.240 --> 01:52:15.400]  told about you but it's one of these things that's moving that we have to mobilize and we have to
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:21.400]  be able to see through vicious queer campaigns and we cannot let people stomp out advertising
[01:52:21.400 --> 01:52:26.440]  dollars people that are doing the right work i mean the situation with war more and sean hannity is
[01:52:26.440 --> 01:52:31.960]  an example of just that people pretending that they're a mob on twitter and say oh if you don't
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:36.440]  do this i'm i'm not going to support you anymore and then these advertisers just bend over you know
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:43.960]  exactly and of course you can expand on that but it again it's the old saying world war two
[01:52:43.960 --> 01:52:49.480]  they didn't have radar then it was just coming out uh and but the germans would put their any
[01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:54.280]  aircraft guns wherever the real stuff was the factories so they have a few reconnaissance
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:58.920]  planes go out get shot at then they knew where to go so i mean i see you getting shot at whoever's
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:03.960]  getting shot at the most that's who you know is the good guy right right it's so interesting and i
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:08.360]  didn't realize that at all and i i specifically thought that for me it was gonna take a little
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:13.240]  bit longer because i mean i just started this and they came so viciously and it makes you question
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:17.080]  like who's in this movement who's not in this movement who's here just as like a parasite to
[01:53:17.080 --> 01:53:22.440]  try to feed off of of new blood and i think that it's well they've got a tv executives that work
[01:53:22.440 --> 01:53:27.240]  for them they call it cue scores viewability watchability you don't just have the aesthetic
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:31.400]  of people wanting to watch you then you're also well spoken and you're smart you mix that together
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:36.360]  they they're you got the trifecta they're scared right and they're trying they tried to stop me
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:39.640]  out so quickly and so viciously but one of the coolest things and i want to give some credit to
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:44.760]  this and credit to you and and credit to dav ruben and paul joseph Watson and mike cernovich in this
[01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:50.120]  moment because one of the coolest things is that people are starting to go back to what i call
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:56.440]  humanism this human element and no matter what you say right you and i spoke we looked each other
[01:53:56.440 --> 01:54:01.080]  in the eye we had a conversation about where i'm from what i'm doing what my goals are so
[01:54:01.080 --> 01:54:06.280]  because you are relying on your instinct as a human being right a smear campaign can't work on you
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:11.000]  and that says something that this is a return to being a human relying on your gut instinct
[01:54:11.000 --> 01:54:15.320]  instead of being fed something by a propaganda machine that tells you if they repeat it enough
[01:54:15.320 --> 01:54:19.160]  times and it's true and that has been the coolest thing that i have seen in this conservative
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:23.880]  movement is people that are relying on their instincts and standing up for one another when
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:29.560]  they see their friend getting shot out that's right and you know it isn't working so they
[01:54:29.560 --> 01:54:35.720]  increase their lies and and google helps with the search results but my bottom line is i think
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:40.520]  it's an old southern kind of weird thing but it's like hope your daughter when she's 17
[01:54:40.520 --> 01:54:44.760]  marries an older rich guy because he's stable and then she won't get a bad you know young guy
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:49.320]  and that you know and any old world thing does that you go to mexico that's done you go to
[01:54:49.320 --> 01:54:53.560]  russia that's done in the rural areas japan does it i mean it didn't just the muslims doing it
[01:54:53.560 --> 01:54:57.320]  they're doing it like they're nine year olds though you know marrying them off but but it's a
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:03.320]  little creepy in a modern way but then all the other stuff it looks like is made up uh and so
[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:07.000]  that's why you know i didn't kind of lean back and i think it's appropriate that trump's gone
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.200]  after franken because we got the photographic evidence you know there was photographic evidence
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:13.960]  of more grabbing some woman's breasts then trump would come out against him trump didn't even
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:21.160]  endorse him right right that's absolutely true i think that's 100% you see that about trump is
[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:24.840]  that he's going to do the right thing at the end of the day and i agree that franken i mean the
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:28.840]  evidence is right there taking a look at it roi i just i don't know where the story is going to
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:32.840]  end i have no guess i did a poll on my twitter you know what do you guys believe roi do you think
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:37.960]  this is the smear campaign um i was saying before i'm not sure if i got cut off but the the evidence
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:42.760]  definitely is getting a little weird i don't buy that the yearbook um was not tampered with that's
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:47.960]  not to say that he didn't sign it at all uh but there's not even his signature it's i mean at
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:52.360]  least i've done a good job with that writing yeah they did they took two different signatures
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:56:00.040]  whatsoever um but and and i'm gonna drive this point hard home is that if for any reason there's
[01:56:00.040 --> 01:56:04.200]  truth these allegations he absolutely needs to step down and i think that there's not a single
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:08.200]  conservative that would disagree with that statement i totally agree with you yeah we're not like the
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:12.520]  democrats who are going to defend people just because they're in a party we halfway for support
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:16.440]  i hate the republican leadership and if he's just one more of those guys get rid of him
[01:56:16.440 --> 01:56:21.480]  what do you make of cnbc nbc and others we have an article on info wars dot com
[01:56:22.440 --> 01:56:28.600]  defending it and saying that franken did nothing wrong but that more is bad i mean that is just
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:34.440]  these people are ridiculous i mean obviously if we had more grabbing some woman's breasts on a photo
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:39.400]  then we'd say step down now right i think it's absolutely ridiculous and let me say something
[01:56:39.400 --> 01:56:43.320]  i know people some people were saying on one side the argument oh it's not a big deal to joke that's
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:47.720]  not funny to me if i'm sleeping and somebody's groping me that's not funny that's never going
[01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:52.360]  to be funny i have a very good sense of humor you know and i've run into this i run into the
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:58.920]  leftist they use bad saying their comedians as an excuse for bad behavior yeah absolutely and it's
[01:56:58.920 --> 01:57:02.600]  it's not a such a bad behavior when somebody is sleeping that there's something that is so
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:07.160]  incredibly violating about that the idea that somebody is sleeping and a picture was taken of
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:11.720]  them it's presumably someone yeah presumably something that they didn't know too well making
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:16.280]  a sexual gesture that is not funny whatsoever we're not going to pretend that's funny well here's the
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:21.480]  deal my wife loves me my wife loves me but i know better than to just grab her in her sleep
[01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:27.560]  let me get slapped in the face yeah same exactly i agree 100% doesn't matter who the man is least
[01:57:27.560 --> 01:57:31.640]  of all when it's a man that's a stranger it's disgusting behavior absolutely you gotta like

[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:40.120]  i mean it's it's it's it's it's assault behavior just what he did to her behind closed doors we'll

[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:33.080]  Pelosi soros headline for their so-called resistance meeting an anti-trump dark money
[02:00:33.080 --> 02:00:36.920]  conference give the latest intel on that and so much more
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:44.680]  or kandace owens red pill black is our guest our story is amazing but just the time we have
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:48.920]  left you know i'm as much as i get attacked she gets attacked imagine how much good trumps doing
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:53.640]  that he's being attacked so much and i never got to this yesterday i didn't get to it two days
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:59.080]  before that i'm going to play today some of his speech in seoul south korea because i want to
[02:00:59.080 --> 02:01:03.400]  make a documentary out of it almost the speech because you could like an hour documentary show
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:08.520]  the 30 minute speech but clips of what he said being true about south korea and then about north
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:16.840]  just the difference of two different countries the same people and then one is a total hell and the
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:21.960]  other is the most productive country in the world the longest one of the longest living i mean it's
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:27.400]  just it's total upside down world and it just shows how authoritarianism is a horrible nightmare
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:32.280]  and it's only good for a few psychopaths that run it kandace what's your overall view on trump you
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:37.480]  think he'll survive i absolutely think he's going to survive and i think i could be a little biased
[02:01:37.480 --> 02:01:42.200]  i just came back from hearing steve bannon speak i'm down here at a conference and i mean he just
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:48.120]  lit the room on fire um with the energy talking about how they did it and uh how they're going
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:54.040]  to keep doing it and look uh trump is prepared for this he knew he was going into and he just
[02:01:54.040 --> 02:02:00.360]  has the spirit for it he's a fighter um and he is inspiring the rest of us to be spire uh to be
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:05.320]  fighters i had to say i was sitting there i was going i had never felt patriotic in my entire life
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:09.880]  until this moment until until trump became the president think about how crazy that is that we
[02:02:09.880 --> 02:02:14.120]  grew up in a country where we weren't proud to be in this country because that's what that's what our
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:18.120]  leaders told us was okay that we had to be ashamed to be american that we had to open our borders
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:24.440]  that we had to sort of get rid of everything that represents the usa and now this populist movement
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:31.000]  is alive and trump is is basically draping himself in the american flag and reminding us of how great
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:36.040]  this country is um so i absolutely think he's going to survive and i think it'll get harder
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:40.280]  and then it's going to get easier because voices like mine are standing up and we're not ashamed
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:44.760]  and we're gonna keep fighting and we're gonna we're gonna help him what you just said is so true
[02:02:44.760 --> 02:02:49.640]  it's not just optimism it's not just empty optimism it's not just the positivity it's that we've
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:54.760]  got the base the history and the system to do it and to come together and the way he goes to other
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:59.720]  countries that also have the right stuff and praises them and tells the truth and it creates
[02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:06.600]  real unity i mean in other countries even in france and places they love him now in japan and south
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:13.160]  korea in russia uh in areas of europe latin america the hype isn't true because because they
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:16.840]  didn't want us to be interested in leaders anymore they didn't want positivity they wanted us to kind
[02:03:16.840 --> 02:03:21.800]  of just give up and go away and be austere but you're right trump has a fighting spirit that is
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:28.200]  infectious and is now helping get others with fighting spirits to stand up and whoever positive
[02:03:28.200 --> 02:03:32.680]  and the sleeping giant really is rising and all the screaming and yelling and threatening is
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:39.000]  the slaves of the brainwashing and those that are brainwashing realizing their time is over
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:45.320]  that doesn't mean some utopias here it just means listen we're not asleep anymore we are not asleep
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:51.320]  you are exactly right and trump is an absolute legend he is a hero in this country and it's sad
[02:03:51.320 --> 02:03:55.480]  to me that there are people that are programmed to hate him because if they could be a part of
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:04:00.440]  they could feel this energy this movement it feels like a fire in like in a belly of a beast right
[02:04:00.440 --> 02:04:05.400]  now and it's coming alive and even hearing i heard katie hopkins speak this morning and she was
[02:04:05.400 --> 02:04:10.600]  just talking about how they've lost uk to hear someone who's patriotic about america that's not
[02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:16.280]  even american telling you what happened to their country and she's saying this country is great okay
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:21.640]  don't let them do to this country what they did to ours how do you not hear that how do you not
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:26.120]  hear the stories people that have lived through this that are telling you that we are lucky
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:30.200]  that we still have our country but we damn well better fight for it and that is what people like
[02:04:30.200 --> 02:04:33.960]  you and i and many other people that have done this before me you know i'm new and just getting
[02:04:33.960 --> 02:04:39.240]  here are doing and we're not gonna stop kandace kandace i do a little bit more in the next segment

[02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:35.800]  just
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:53.800]  so
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:58.760]  black just set me on fire i wanted to kick into that again when i talked about the type of person
[02:06:58.760 --> 02:07:03.640]  trump is and how he's a fighter and how he went to scott one for six months about a year before he
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:10.040]  decided to run or before he announced it and he made the decision not to do it for his family
[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:16.680]  and then he felt so guilty that he basically envisioned the whole thing winning how they
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:23.800]  make fun of him what they do what would unfold and uh and i was told this by roger stone who
[02:07:23.800 --> 02:07:29.560]  talked to trump about it at length was the head of his campaign at first and then later in political
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:36.360]  there was this whole article about how trump did it and it was he had some of the same stuff from
[02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:43.960]  from band and others um about what trump you know did and he's very fatalistic that's why
[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:48.040]  he'll walk without the secret service and he just says i don't care stand out and he
[02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:51.400]  doesn't want to die but if somebody kills him
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:58.280]  then he knows he'll win even bigger it's it's something else folks i mean trump's the real
[02:07:58.280 --> 02:08:04.200]  warrior the real deal and i'll tell you i know the other behind the scenes stuff he's not a racist
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:08.760]  in fact he it's the opposite and i'm not gonna be patronizing about it and say john trump really
[02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:13.160]  likes black people but he does uh because he likes people that are optimistic energy strong
[02:08:13.160 --> 02:08:17.080]  he loves everybody unless you're trying to dominate him then he wants to dominate you
[02:08:17.080 --> 02:08:23.640]  and who he wants to dominate is the bullies he wants to set america lose folks and he got
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:28.280]  screwed over his dad came from nowhere their family had to fight in new york in the middle
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:32.120]  of that with a mob and everything to be builders and they won you don't think they didn't do some
[02:08:32.120 --> 02:08:37.080]  stuff behind the scenes let folks know leave him alone i mean the trumps are fighters folks and
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:42.280]  the globalists are scared of him it's real doesn't mean he's not co-opting them doesn't mean he
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:47.480]  doesn't do everything perfect he's getting the best done he can and that's why they're so scared
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:50.600]  and i'm not gonna go over all the accomplishments but you just set me on fire there spend a few
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:54.760]  minutes about this conference hearing band and speak who this woman was you saw speak talking
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:58.280]  about what other countries are like because let me tell you go to some other countries folks
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:02.760]  especially third world countries or other stuff i mean you learn real quick what authoritarianism
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:07.720]  is what bondage is what people giving up is and then you understand now i see why the
[02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:13.000]  globalist fashion america so much because it's got ideas that ever implemented bring down their
[02:09:13.000 --> 02:09:17.320]  global system doesn't mean we don't have sins doesn't mean we don't have big problems the
[02:09:17.320 --> 02:09:22.520]  difference is we've had these experiences together and we've got an idea that martin was a king
[02:09:22.520 --> 02:09:27.320]  talked about that is the american dream that we ever really realize it is unlimited just just 10
[02:09:27.320 --> 02:09:31.480]  percent getting realized that it's the richest country in the world we had half the world's wealth
[02:09:31.480 --> 02:09:36.840]  until about a decade ago and it's because we were creating the wealth so so get back into this
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:42.280]  conference who you heard speak give us the details canis red pill black it's not over yet i can just
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:48.360]  tell you that this is the most amazing thing and i i staff over the sentiment and the emotions of
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:53.160]  what i'm feeling right now having just had these conversations so to take it from the top i mean
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:57.560]  you get we get in last night and the first person i have a long conversation with this
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:02.680]  and culture and i'm just telling her like you're amazing i have read all of your stuff i came from
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:06.840]  the left now i'm on the right and i'm telling her i'm getting attacked and she just instills that
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:11.400]  confidence you know face to face she says you know what you do you punch back and you keep going and
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:15.720]  you keep doing what you do you punch back and you keep going and that has been the mentality and the
[02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:20.760]  theme of this counter resistance which is it's david harrowett's event he does it once a year
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:25.560]  and he really pulls everybody that is on the front line everyone that is getting killed by
[02:10:25.560 --> 02:10:30.040]  depressed killed by people in the community community that are lying about and smearing about
[02:10:30.040 --> 02:10:34.360]  you know smearing them when they're just trying to do the right patriotic thing to do for this country
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:38.680]  katie hopkins if you don't know her she's a british reporter she's huge absolutely massive she
[02:10:38.680 --> 02:10:44.280]  writes for the um the daily mail she's the one that writes all those pieces and her speech i mean
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:49.160]  i thought i almost brought tears to my eyes i mean everyone was on their feet just a round of an
[02:10:49.160 --> 02:10:53.480]  applause standing ovation for her she was so funny and so quirky in the way that you know only the
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:58.120]  brits can do my lo is going to be speaking and going to be speaking gavin mckinnis up there
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:02.040]  i mean i don't think i've laughed harder he's like he could be a stand-up comedian and
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:08.360]  he's just talking about he used to be a stand-up comedian he got bad he got he got uh blacklisted
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:14.520]  because he uh because he became a libertarian yeah well and he's just telling the story about how
[02:11:14.520 --> 02:11:19.000]  he was at the support ball he just punched somebody back and and and that sort of is
[02:11:19.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  that a symbolic of what it is that we're talking about it is and they can't stand the fact that
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:27.240]  we're finally punching back yeah they don't know what to do and he and he says that he says the
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:31.640]  person made a face and they just couldn't believe it out he couldn't believe that they were getting
[02:11:31.640 --> 02:11:35.160]  punched back you know because they saw them they have just been the bullies and they have been
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:38.760]  punching us and they've been saying this is what you are they tell me you're a coon your uncle's
[02:11:38.760 --> 02:11:42.520]  town you're a doctor you're this and you're that and i'm saying i'm not going to take it sitting down
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:47.240]  okay we are the counter resistance we are here and c bannon when he talked about trump and his
[02:11:47.240 --> 02:11:52.200]  fighting spirit and how he met him and the and everyone here is telling their their experiences
[02:11:52.200 --> 02:11:58.120]  there's a double amputee who is um uh i believe uh the congressman in florida you know he fought
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:02.680]  for this country lost his legs and now he's the congressman and he is talking to us telling us
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:08.120]  about how patriotic he is and how he wants to help this country and meanwhile colin capronik is on
[02:12:08.120 --> 02:12:13.960]  the cover for gq okay he's on the cover for an outstanding man and it looks so stupid when you
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:19.640]  see the covers with with uh co baron all of them propped up it's embarrassing i wouldn't be on the
[02:12:19.640 --> 02:12:24.360]  cover of gq if they asked me now i wouldn't take a peace prize now it's all right they don't get
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:29.480]  what jokes they are it's such a joke and but when you look at this guy who's got two prosthetic
[02:12:29.480 --> 02:12:35.400]  legs and he is still fighting for this country as a congressman and you feel the energy in that room
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:39.640]  when he spoke and by the way he's the same congressman that went in when they wouldn't put up
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:45.400]  even three four months in trump's picture at the va in florida remember right yeah yeah he is just
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:52.120]  this man okay is amazing okay and i i cannot emphasize enough how amazing this man is and how
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:56.760]  he can move the room and his experience with his fighting spirit is that fighting spirit
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:13:01.480]  that is what david horowitz was able to curate with this weekend if you are a fighter if they
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:05.720]  are trying to silence you you are here this weekend and he wants you to inspire one another and
[02:13:05.720 --> 02:13:10.360]  that's why that's why the audience to know they know they're not doing it but you can't go to
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:14.920]  sleep and i know you're not meant to fight politics every year every month but this is the big global
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:20.840]  turning this is every bit of energy we put in now goes on for thousands of years yes this is a fight
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:25.080]  there's no other fight this is a fight that everyone needs to be and do whatever you do whatever
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:29.480]  your talent is if it's videos if it's talking if it's blogging if it's praying be a part of this
[02:13:29.480 --> 02:13:34.440]  because we are making history right now alex and i can't underestimate the power of prayer as well
[02:13:35.240 --> 02:13:39.880]  right it's just we need everything and i say that all the time it's and it's not just me
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:43.800]  making videos people that support me you know i couldn't do without them i couldn't do without
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:48.920]  them writing to me and saying you don't believe this keep going keep going um so it's it's well
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:53.080]  absolutely and the things they made up about you won't even i mean things they made up about you
[02:13:53.080 --> 02:13:57.960]  were all total bull but again exactly just say it's bull move on just keep getting the fighting
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:01.560]  punch back and keep going that is what and culture said to me that is what katie hopkins
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:05.400]  said to me and i said god bless you woman because they've been doing it for years and years and
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:09.720]  years and i looked at myself and i said what's my excuse what am i have said about you know this
[02:14:09.720 --> 02:14:12.600]  is one of many smears that are going to come they're going to try to shut me up and you know
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:19.080]  my job is to punch back and keep going and to wake up the black community because this is a war okay
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:24.280]  this is an information war and what side of it you fall on is going to be how you represent
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:29.720]  yourself historically because we are making history right now i was about to say a lot of
[02:14:29.720 --> 02:14:33.720]  folks have come now and we're starting to have big victories but this is the peak of the battle
[02:14:33.720 --> 02:14:38.600]  we're going into so this is the hardest time but also the best time to be getting involved
[02:14:38.600 --> 02:14:43.160]  and every call to c-span every everybody that wears a t-shirt in public everybody that you
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:47.000]  is loving their children everybody that prays to god everybody that supports a broadcast like
[02:14:47.000 --> 02:14:53.720]  this or shares a link all of it together is a giant mountain of energy every day many hands make
[02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:58.760]  light work folks so again when i tell you thank you info wars the president's told me this it's
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:04.120]  been said all over the news they know it trump wouldn't be president if it wasn't for info wars
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:11.320]  if it wasn't for you the audience we were the key heart cadre in support and an information warfare

[02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:18.280]  she's getting stopped getting followed and they broke it into her phone so i'm going to find out
[02:20:18.280 --> 02:20:23.640]  more from her during the next break so that's that's going on right before i got on air 30
[02:20:23.640 --> 02:20:30.280]  seconds ago 45 seconds ago so all hell's breaking loose basically here in the war room that's why
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:36.600]  i call the elin shroyer show the the war room i mean that's what this is it's like we had the all
[02:20:36.600 --> 02:20:42.680]  franken news day and a half before but i wasn't afraid to put it out i was just like
[02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:50.920]  okay but i gotta wait and and i can't say who the woman is i'm not gonna cover it
[02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:56.760]  as he most people would like want that big breaking story i i just want to be credible
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:21:01.400]  and and actually help things to make things better but you can see how we tweeted out just
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:06.680]  having on record before it came out that we had the news is that's why they constantly you know
[02:21:06.680 --> 02:21:13.240]  say oh we're fake news because they know folks we make mistakes but we're not trying to make mistakes
[02:21:14.120 --> 02:21:20.680]  we are beating ourselves up to tell the truth and not because we're mr goody tissues man we
[02:21:20.680 --> 02:21:29.160]  want to have integrity my ancestors had integrity i remember being a teenager you're kind of naturally
[02:21:29.160 --> 02:21:35.880]  nasty when you're a teenager i think it my dad and his dad and my mother's dad and my mother's
[02:21:35.880 --> 02:21:43.320]  brother were just mr america goody two shoes and it wasn't an act it wasn't it was like
[02:21:44.040 --> 02:21:50.520]  they were enslaved to being good men i'm not as good as they are i'll be honest with you i have
[02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:55.320]  a dark side i don't let it run me but i can see into the enemy more because i see how they see us
[02:21:56.200 --> 02:22:04.360]  so that's how god works i'm a more twisted uh and so i understand what the enemy's up to
[02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:13.160]  to but back when i was darker i was never given over to evil but when i was darker i thought they
[02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:21.240]  were weak because they were good men people they're into evil they think they're so strong
[02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:25.240]  because they're not good people they think they're strong because they only care about themselves
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:34.600]  and sometimes they're weak they're weak you see the fact that i have a weak side i can understand
[02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:42.680]  these people and my good side's big that's the difference though that
[02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:49.320]  i've got all these hillary clips i want to play now i'll get to their latest secret meeting
[02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:53.560]  now this is very very important you know i've got so many of these let's just go ahead and start
[02:22:53.560 --> 02:23:00.600]  with the first one and it's self-explanatory corporate media is now behaving like questioning
[02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:06.680]  the clintons is some war crime and that you know trump wants a dictatorship even though the clintons
[02:23:06.680 --> 02:23:10.680]  tried to get dictatorships obama tried to put it in that they're the ones that want to censor the
[02:23:10.680 --> 02:23:14.840]  press they're the ones that want to open our borders up and sign us over to the tpp and
[02:23:14.840 --> 02:23:20.680]  dictatorial systems and then now they're setting it up where where trumps the bad guy and anybody
[02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:25.800]  that criticizes you know the clintons wants a dictatorship oh because what you're still in
[02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:30.360]  the government so we want you out of government that's a dictatorship because that's how they see
[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:36.440]  it is it's their camp still in power and they're holding back the great trump evil here it is this
[02:23:36.440 --> 02:23:43.080]  appears to be uh the politicization of the justice department and our justice system
[02:23:43.080 --> 02:23:51.080]  uh this iranian one story has been debunked countless times uh by members of the press
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:57.880]  by independent experts uh it is nothing but a you know a false charge that pause
[02:23:59.240 --> 02:24:03.080]  look at this reporter he looks just like the buzzfeed reporters like a woman that cut their
[02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:08.280]  hair short and i'm not being mean but they're all like little skinny zombies you've never
[02:24:08.280 --> 02:24:13.240]  heard of because that's who slime bags like hillary want to be around they don't want to have real
[02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:16.760]  men around them in fact they've haven't had they've had mainstream news articles saying
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:21.320]  and psychiatrists have pointed out that hillary always wants really ugly people around her
[02:24:21.320 --> 02:24:28.200]  because she's ugly too see that's why misery loves company but oh uranium one it's been debunked
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:33.160]  even the new york times admitted smoking guy you guys have been caught red-handed but you say it's
[02:24:33.160 --> 02:24:38.120]  been debunked oh and you never had a secret server either you told our reporters that oh i never
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:45.240]  had a server none of it was hacked if you like your doctor you can keep it here let's continue
[02:24:46.360 --> 02:24:53.560]  members of the press by independent experts uh it is nothing but a you know a false charge that
[02:24:55.080 --> 02:24:58.600]  the trump administration is uh trying to drum up in order to avoid
[02:24:59.400 --> 02:25:04.440]  attention being directed at them i mean even trey gaudy somebody who's hardly a fan of mine
[02:25:04.440 --> 02:25:10.840]  uh said uh that uh you know there doesn't seem to be the basis for a special counsel of course
[02:25:10.840 --> 02:25:16.200]  there isn't but if i try to take myself out of it which you know is kind of hard because it's
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:23.640]  personally uh offensive that they would do this but taking myself out of it this is such an abuse
[02:25:23.640 --> 02:25:30.200]  of power and it goes right at the rule of law what as secretary of state i went around the
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:35.880]  world bragging about america's rule of law that we were a nation of law okay well it's not done
[02:25:35.880 --> 02:25:40.600]  you know the justice system was blind and obviously i'd cut her off she doesn't say
[02:25:40.600 --> 02:25:44.680]  anything i can't listen to it here's what trey gaudy really said here's the clips he's talking about
[02:25:45.320 --> 02:25:50.040]  on the issue of special counsel um i did not sign jim jordan's a great friend i have
[02:25:50.040 --> 02:25:54.360]  tremendous respect for him i did not sign the letter because i don't think the threshold
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:58.360]  has been met for the appointment of special counsel and i think this is a really important
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:26:03.960]  point you can investigate something without special counsel in fact 99.9 percent of all
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:08.600]  investigations in this country are done by the women and men at the department of justice and
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:14.040]  the u.s attorney's offices and none of them is called special counsel so there's a threshold
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:20.680]  that has to be met um and i don't think it has been met so to say we're not going to appoint
[02:26:20.680 --> 02:26:24.840]  special counsel is not to say we're not going to look into something you're saying the threshold
[02:26:24.840 --> 02:26:31.080]  has not been met yeah i mean at what point is it met what what do you need to get there
[02:26:31.080 --> 02:26:35.880]  if you conflict if you do get there a conflict of interest where the department of justice
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:42.680]  and all 94 u.s attorney's offices are ill-suited and the public would not have confidence in an
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:47.880]  investigation that they ran i mean look at bob mother was appointed special counsel some of
[02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:52.280]  your viewers don't have confidence in him so the appointment of special counsel does not
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:57.480]  talismanically make people all of a sudden have confidence i was about to say it was done because
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:27:01.800]  people didn't have confidence and it was done politically so why do we create another political
[02:27:01.800 --> 02:27:07.240]  thing that's what's really being said here but we're getting lost here in the weeds folks they're
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:11.560]  all super guilty the fact that he's saying it doesn't reach the level of special counsel that means
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:15.640]  there's not public confidence well i think there is a public confidence in the justice department
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:20.760]  right now actually gaudy i disagree with gaudy on that but here's morning joe saying iranium one
[02:27:20.760 --> 02:27:25.720]  is dumb conspiracy theory oh you didn't give the iranium there wasn't a criminal investigation
[02:27:25.720 --> 02:27:30.440]  miller didn't order its hand you're full of baloney here it is we had an attorney general
[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:37.080]  that stepped up and did not look like he was not going to allow look like he was not going to allow
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:45.960]  our president our republicans in congress turned this justice department into some device for a
[02:27:45.960 --> 02:27:54.280]  tyrannical autocrat in the making if he listened to donald trump who have been telling which shatter
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:59.400]  constitutional norms and would be chilling president trump and his allies have been
[02:27:59.400 --> 02:28:05.160]  hammering the clinton state department for months calling the iranium one deal quote watergate
[02:28:05.160 --> 02:28:11.240]  modern age it's also been covered virtually wall to wall on fox new sam sign shep actually just
[02:28:11.240 --> 02:28:17.960]  is incredible shep undercut this this entire conspiracy theory and it is it it is yeah and
[02:28:18.600 --> 02:28:25.000]  the clown show theory because again you had all these agencies that had to sign off on it this
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.440]  wasn't hillary clinton saying give me money you know i'm going to take care of this yeah there's
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:35.480]  nine agency c control criminal investigations they ordered killed gosh almighty i mean iranium
[02:28:35.480 --> 02:28:40.680]  deals secret deals transfer deals and then you're talking about donald trump jr trying to meet to
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:45.240]  find corruption on hillary that's russian collusion but iranium transfers aren't and then buying off

[02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:31.160]  all right millie weaver just came in here they just got back from hillary clinton's visit to
[02:33:31.160 --> 02:33:35.960]  austin texas we got other reporters going to her demos event sure they know that
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:44.040]  her stupid book tour of her failure of a book what happened you happened lady people woke up to you
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:51.560]  millie just came in and told me the footage they got now it was millie one week before
[02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:57.240]  in cleveland ohio one week before september 11th when hillary fell down like one of the towers
[02:33:57.960 --> 02:34:00.840]  and fell on her face the media tried to cover it up but we had the footage
[02:34:03.320 --> 02:34:06.680]  they would just show her stumble and say that was it not the rest of her falling over
[02:34:06.680 --> 02:34:11.080]  and being thrown on the side of the black ambulance like a side of beef as the secret service said
[02:34:11.080 --> 02:34:16.680]  millie and gavin were following her around and they got her in the emergency tent for an hour
[02:34:16.680 --> 02:34:23.080]  and the and the emergency stretchers we have those articles in fact here's some of the footage of
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:32.520]  hillary falling down they were at the event and they got hillary having to be lifted out of the
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:37.560]  ambulance again they had to pull her up and had to physically set her up and pull her out
[02:34:39.640 --> 02:34:42.680]  and you see him holding on to her and helping her upstairs all that other footage
[02:34:42.680 --> 02:34:49.000]  it's like the weekend with bernie's when she has these seizures from the brain tumor
[02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:53.000]  and then you know we're not supposed to know that information you know there's
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:59.160]  federal laws on medical records so i just had a cia source say that that should be looked into
[02:34:59.960 --> 02:35:01.400]  the point is is that
[02:35:08.040 --> 02:35:11.240]  they have footage of her having to be pulled out of the vehicle not being able to get up
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:16.920]  up and they had them calling the dallas police or austin police dallas is next uh on
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:23.400]  millie and then the dallas police tell their goons leave her alone she's allowed to be out here
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:28.040]  on the sidewalk so good for the austin cops i don't know the dallas cops will be so good
[02:35:28.040 --> 02:35:31.880]  she's about to be there next so this is just incredible
[02:35:35.160 --> 02:35:38.200]  now i want to go ahead and go to this next clip but she's going to be coming on either next
[02:35:38.200 --> 02:35:43.080]  segment or fourth hour with myself and mike sarnovich but we're going to have millie weaver
[02:35:43.080 --> 02:35:48.200]  our intrepid reporter her and gavin just when it comes to devastating victories every time they go out
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:56.760]  i mean they've got powerful gods and i don't mean that in a paganistic way that's a quote from the
[02:35:56.760 --> 02:36:02.280]  show rom on hbub which is actually a real quote from julia caeser he talked about people that kept
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:08.200]  having good success good luck they'd say these men have powerful gods and you know the fact that
[02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:13.320]  good luck gods on their side the forces with them they just every time they go out it's just
[02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:21.880]  fantastical uh what they get so very very awesome to have them on the team they just
[02:36:21.880 --> 02:36:29.080]  continually get really powerful stuff so again this is just them trying to block so you can't
[02:36:29.080 --> 02:36:32.680]  see but they've got the footage they're blowing it up right now where they're picking her up and
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:37.800]  getting her up which is what the secret service told us one month
[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:47.400]  before she collapsed on september 11th last year one month before they told us
[02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:53.240]  that listen we don't know what's wrong with her you're the one that has guessed on about her
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:58.360]  brain tumor all we know is she's having convulsions every 45 minutes or so she's got a black
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:02.920]  am you once it's got lift gates on it on the back of the front they've got clinic things set up
[02:37:02.920 --> 02:37:08.840]  she's having these convulsions all the time and that's all we're going to tell you so just tell
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:14.120]  everybody follow her around you'll get it well we got her at the emergency tent the week before
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:21.320]  in cleveland this uh dutch video guy he was a fan he just got back there and caught it so the secret
[02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:27.720]  service was right we were proven right again from our sources it happened just like we told you the
[02:37:27.720 --> 02:37:34.360]  fish reported main shooter in the vegas thing uh paddock had gone to the middle east with his
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:39.880]  girlfriend and had a visitor and was there days earlier and had islamic paraphernalia and antifa
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:47.320]  that all came out later except for the antifa part because i mean we got that directly from
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:51.480]  and people say well wait i thought the fbi is corrupt but then you're saying the houses rescue
[02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:58.040]  team they're not all corrupt a fish rots from the head crap rolls downhill
[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:05.560]  i mean you're in there and you see all this islamic stuff and you know where paddock's been you've
[02:38:05.560 --> 02:38:14.120]  got his m o you want to tell people you don't see gun owners being blamed because the guys that
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:19.960]  actually do the shooting in the fbi they're for a military or current military or patriots they
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:25.400]  don't like the politico is always getting away with murder i haven't even hit on the news i mean
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:30.280]  it's usually such big topics that i literally sit here like 200 articles probably i bet if i count
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:40.440]  all these articles i bet there's 200 conservatively i mean just the stacks like 15 so 15 15 45
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:47.800]  65 70 oh yeah it's well over it's maybe 120 a little bit like today sometimes they have 200
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:53.080]  300 i don't know this is a big stack that's like 30 articles the point is is that
[02:38:55.720 --> 02:39:00.280]  i don't have all the answers we've got social engineers they admit they're doing this to us
[02:39:00.840 --> 02:39:04.680]  they only operate in the dark they operate with our tax money they operate with corporate
[02:39:04.680 --> 02:39:09.640]  jurisdiction offshore that are above the law they got thousands of labs human animal chimeras
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:20.360]  got hell that's 35 years old who knows what they've got now all i know is all they talk about in
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:25.000]  public reports is how they want to get rid of the majority of the public how we're a bunch of weevils
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:35.800]  eating up their planet and i'm like listen buddy i'm gonna tell people about this and it's not
[02:39:35.800 --> 02:39:41.240]  because i'm some hero they're trying to make me take vaccines and my kids and i know they're jacking
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:46.600]  with them it's called self-preservation when i see somebody else in a car wreck get out with
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:53.000]  their face smash bleeding i have empathy because i know what that feels like i know it could be my
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:59.640]  kids in that wreck the fact that i got nerve endings doesn't mean i'm a wimp it's the opposite i've
[02:39:59.640 --> 02:40:08.120]  got feelings because that's how you get through the world is having feelings being connected the
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:13.640]  globalists work to not have feelings and they become psychopaths or sociopaths and it's a joke
[02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:18.840]  and i'm tired of these people i don't like them they don't produce wealth they don't produce
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:23.880]  longevity they don't produce anything but baloney like north korea and you know what i'm gonna do
[02:40:23.880 --> 02:40:30.680]  one way or another the water doesn't rise over bear creek or the air doesn't lip the admiral
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:36.840]  i am going to shoot a special video about trump's speech in south korea because if i just air it
[02:40:36.840 --> 02:40:43.000]  it's 30 minutes long it's powerful but if i show images and documents and clips and make it like 45
[02:40:43.000 --> 02:40:47.160]  minutes an hour long where he builds up south korea and shows how they're like one of the most
[02:40:47.160 --> 02:40:53.640]  successful countries in the world per capita of the average person the biggest middle class i mean
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:57.320]  it's just amazing they have the highest rate of autism though because they're they're very
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:02.520]  dutiful they take all their vaccines they do whatever america says well that means the corrupt
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:06.520]  interests that are in america that mean america's perfect or great or the best or the worst we're
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:11.240]  amazing but we're not one thing we're amazingly good we're amazingly bad
[02:41:13.640 --> 02:41:18.040]  we're looking forward looking backward we're looking all around but freedom comes with that
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:23.000]  a lot of choices a lot of good a lot of bad a lot of in between but he just lays out how
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:28.680]  they are compared to the north how it's two different universes completely and how authoritarianism
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:33.480]  versus independence and the individual is two different universes and how the secrets of the
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:38.760]  universe must be unlocked by the individual mind and the individual inventor from the
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:43.800]  lowest to the highest and that's what's going to empower us in the future it is an incredible speech
[02:41:47.240 --> 02:41:51.480]  and it documents the difference between free market and communism authoritarianism
[02:41:51.480 --> 02:41:59.720]  and and and and libertarianism just briefly if you don't buy the products we've got at

[02:47:42.760 --> 02:47:48.040]  in the morning joe goes on to say what joseph stalin would do uh actually what you're doing trying
[02:47:48.040 --> 02:47:53.080]  to attack free press trying to raise taxes on poor people all the rest that that's what joe
[02:47:53.080 --> 02:47:57.160]  stalin would actually do so let's go ahead and play a few more of these clips ahead of
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:03.480]  milley weaver we're going to go into the fourth hour with mike sternovich who's doing a great
[02:48:03.480 --> 02:48:09.000]  job co-hosting that with us with hillary here in austin and where she was and what happened to her
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:13.160]  having to be picked up and propped up and brought in a new footage of this them trying to have the
[02:48:13.160 --> 02:48:19.160]  cops go after our our reporters the cops said no you leave them alone so a lot of good things
[02:48:19.160 --> 02:48:23.640]  happening there people know the enemy is don't worry but right now let's go ahead and go to
[02:48:24.280 --> 02:48:28.280]  this clip seeing and investigating clinton is what happens in an authoritarian country
[02:48:35.400 --> 02:48:39.160]  now we've got some technical problems here let's let's stop it no big deal to have that
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:44.200]  occasionally happen um you guys want to try to reload it or just say it's not there i'm cool
[02:48:44.200 --> 02:48:50.680]  either way this happens on live tv so that clip's not working i've been wanting to play that one
[02:48:50.680 --> 02:48:54.040]  that's a real good one let's let's redownload that one let's go ahead go to the next one
[02:48:54.040 --> 02:49:00.840]  dealing with the uh joe stalin stuff uh so here's that clip first of all we're gonna get how horrific
[02:49:00.840 --> 02:49:08.520]  this is uh what a horrific precedent this would set if donald trump goes after his political
[02:49:08.520 --> 02:49:12.680]  opponent this way uses the justice department pressures the justice department pressures the
[02:49:12.680 --> 02:49:18.600]  attorney general to do this this is this is what happens uh this is what joseph stalin would do uh
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:27.080]  this is uh what what tyrants have done for years is sick their uh their people on political opponents
[02:49:27.080 --> 02:49:34.680]  but just the underlying charge uh the claim here that somehow the clinton's benefited from this
[02:49:34.680 --> 02:49:42.840]  still going through it's an absence of malice moment where you know whole newman leans back
[02:49:42.840 --> 02:49:48.360]  in his chair and says prove it they're not gonna they're not gonna prove anything here there's no
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:55.640]  smoking gun here there's no nothing here that's going to prove that the clinton somehow uh got
[02:49:55.640 --> 02:50:04.040]  money i mean it might look bad but putting a special prosecutor there's going to uncomfortable this is so
[02:50:04.040 --> 02:50:09.080]  pathetic instead of horrific precedent you know because there have been times and and this troubled
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:15.800]  presidency that people have stood stood up and actually put the constitutional republic first
[02:50:15.800 --> 02:50:19.960]  you saw that we have sessions with accusing himself because it was the right thing to do
[02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:26.360]  you saw that with rod rozenstein accusing himself and appointing uh bob muller because that was the
[02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:31.400]  right thing to do and in doing that there's a lot of cowardice everything else these guys have done
[02:50:31.400 --> 02:50:37.400]  or will do those were shining moments where they put the country and the constitution first
[02:50:38.680 --> 02:50:42.840]  now it's game on in the justice department and it's time what about that dead intern in your
[02:50:42.840 --> 02:50:47.720]  office justice department to do the same thing stand up for the rule of law stand up for the
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:52.040]  constitution of the united states are always trying to destroy constitutional norms and by the way
[02:50:52.040 --> 02:50:55.640]  look at just car bro you know i don't believe he's really an alien from mars but in mars attack
[02:50:55.640 --> 02:51:00.120]  the girl has the b i've eric eyed because he's really an alien i mean is he really an alien gray
[02:51:00.760 --> 02:51:05.880]  let's put him back on screen i'm being sarcastic these are say jones believes carbo as an alien
[02:51:05.880 --> 02:51:12.040]  just what a bozo the clown and then you've got mika brazinski and her war criminal father
[02:51:12.600 --> 02:51:17.080]  you know sitting there and and it's like it may look bad they got money from the russians and
[02:51:17.080 --> 02:51:21.800]  gave them all the uranium but they got the government to say it was legal under obama so it's okay
[02:51:24.520 --> 02:51:29.400]  and then they had the fbi killing investigation he just sits up there bumbling this is what you get
[02:51:29.400 --> 02:51:37.560]  when a dead intern's found in your place and then forever after your justice creature look
[02:51:37.560 --> 02:51:44.440]  how pathetic they all look i mean almost no one even watches these shows and now he's going with
[02:51:44.440 --> 02:51:51.480]  this david brock look where he has this big bozo haired i am from mars i am here i'm playing
[02:51:51.480 --> 02:51:57.960]  with ours and we're just supposed to bow down to this guy i'm so sick of him pathetic oh look at
[02:51:57.960 --> 02:52:07.160]  this little snibblet of news polosi soros headline anti trump dark money conference
[02:52:08.920 --> 02:52:13.080]  that's up on news wars dot com the democracy alliance you know they're not funding the air
[02:52:13.080 --> 02:52:18.200]  of spring or overthrowing the iranian government trying to cross a race war a dark money organization
[02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:24.520]  of prominent far-left donors that have all pledged to funnel money to approve left-wing groups to
[02:52:24.520 --> 02:52:31.080]  resist president trump close quote travel to california's lakosa resort wednesday to attend
[02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:37.880]  their three-day fall summit with polosi soros each set to give speeches that's the news wars
[02:52:37.880 --> 02:52:42.600]  headline on it but notice seven of the ten richest members of congress are democrats yeah i've seen
[02:52:42.600 --> 02:52:47.000]  the statistics the democrats have five times the wealth of the republicans and congress
[02:52:48.040 --> 02:52:55.080]  just like all the top globalists warren buffett bill gates jeff bezos
[02:52:55.960 --> 02:53:02.920]  ted turner just all of them are democrats because they're globalists they want to wreck everything
[02:53:02.920 --> 02:53:08.440]  take over flood us with cheap labor tax exempt but they want to raise taxes all day so there's
[02:53:08.440 --> 02:53:13.400]  more middle-class money because they get bailouts and stuff warren buffett biggest recipient of the
[02:53:13.400 --> 02:53:21.800]  2008 bailout 487 billion dollars that his company and he got he got something like
[02:53:23.160 --> 02:53:29.960]  50 we put the mclatchy headline it'll save us some he got 50 plus billion himself in one day
[02:53:32.280 --> 02:53:37.080]  i'd buy that for a dollar boy i'm glad he's a liberal hey i get all your tax money and
[02:53:37.080 --> 02:53:42.680]  fun third world slave factories but as long as i say i'm liberal look i he always poses because

[02:53:51.160 --> 02:53:54.920]  know the really rich people are for globalism and are leftist because they don't want you to have
[02:53:54.920 --> 02:54:01.720]  any money or any future to out shut up you kkk remember i heard tom brokaw say you were a nazi
[02:54:01.720 --> 02:54:07.960]  really did tom brokaw show a clip of that no because don brokaw is a joke he looks just
[02:54:07.960 --> 02:54:16.440]  like george rb and bush now he's like uh tom brokaw here hey i got a word racist he erases

[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:26.200]  crew here's here's the clip of them saying um seeing and investigating clinton is what happens
[02:55:26.200 --> 02:55:31.080]  in authoritarian countries they're investigating trump made up crap shut down the press arrest
[02:55:31.080 --> 02:55:37.400]  alex jones but when we say investigate them oh that's authoritarianism here it is you have
[02:55:37.400 --> 02:55:42.920]  to also do it in context back november 22nd that's qualmo remember you we're allowed to read with
[02:55:42.920 --> 02:55:47.800]  elix he said you're not and if you do we'll arrest you sorry let me get back to qualmo he also said
[02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:54.680]  let your daughter shower with men and let them see their genitals or your sexist you're against
[02:55:54.680 --> 02:56:00.120]  trainees he said that so back to the guy that uh thinks that full grown men should shower with
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:05.720]  your 12 year old daughter serious you have to also do it in context back november 22nd after
[02:56:05.720 --> 02:56:09.320]  the election the president was asked about this so you're going to go after the clinton's because
[02:56:09.320 --> 02:56:14.760]  you kept saying you were going to do it all during the election here's what he said it was that well
[02:56:14.760 --> 02:56:19.960]  when it goes up already so look i want to move forward i don't want to move back and i don't
[02:56:19.960 --> 02:56:25.000]  want to hurt the clinton's i really don't she went through a lot and suffered greatly in many
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:28.920]  different ways and i'm not looking to hurt them at all that's him trying to be gracious so that's
[02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:35.320]  where this started now well i pause i told him days before that they're going to play pasta then
[02:56:35.320 --> 02:56:41.800]  come at your neck sir and i told him that about 10 more times and now the president does listen to

[03:00:14.040 --> 03:00:18.680]  bombshell hillary news footage we just got her having to be helped out of a car ties into her
[03:00:18.680 --> 03:00:23.560]  collapsing with millie weaver and gabin wint and of course hosting will be my concern to which
[03:00:23.560 --> 03:00:28.920]  but first here's a few minutes of paul watson yesterday i'm with gabin mcganis on get off my
[03:00:28.920 --> 03:00:38.600]  lawn how are we doing paul good to be here gabin uh how's life you're killing it it's not too bad
[03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:44.120]  i've been trying to spend more time on youtube recently um spend more time on scripting videos
[03:00:44.120 --> 03:00:48.520]  especially and less time on twitter which is very addictive but i'm trying to get away from twitter
[03:00:48.520 --> 03:00:54.280]  a little bit so i put this video up last night because i thought it was um quite apropos with
[03:00:54.280 --> 03:00:59.320]  what's going on with the whole sexual abuse scandal fallout because it seems to be being
[03:00:59.320 --> 03:01:04.840]  conflated by the media and by the left i'll give you an example the last thing i saw on twitter
[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:10.440]  last night was a headline out of fox news steven seagull accused of telling actress to sit on
[03:01:10.440 --> 03:01:17.480]  his face in 1991 so they're talking about this was a conversation over the phone gabin's like he
[03:01:17.480 --> 03:01:22.840]  didn't even say it to her face she said no that was the end of it whatever else steven seagull may
[03:01:22.840 --> 03:01:28.680]  have done it's like the world will keep turning despite this apocalyptic bombshell from 26 years
[03:01:28.680 --> 03:01:34.360]  ago and that's what i talked about in the video that i put up last night the new sexual puritan so
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:41.400]  the process that we're seeing they're conflating all these like vague allegations men clumsily
[03:01:41.400 --> 03:01:47.240]  approaching women being rebuffed and then taking it and conflating it with actual sexual assault of
[03:01:47.240 --> 03:01:53.160]  the harvey winestein variety so you've seen all these top feminists over the past couple of weeks
[03:01:53.160 --> 03:01:59.080]  lindy west being given a platform by the new york times helen rosner kate harding matt migori the
[03:01:59.080 --> 03:02:05.400]  actor on cnn basically saying oh look this proves what we claimed all along the all men are misogynists
[03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:11.240]  all men are perverts look what's happened we've been proven right so they're taking it twisting it
[03:02:11.240 --> 03:02:17.240]  and hijacking it to try and resurrect third wave feminism trying to resurrect this misandric belief
[03:02:17.240 --> 03:02:24.040]  that all men are perverts again to to fulfill their own agenda which is if you read the articles
[03:02:24.040 --> 03:02:29.960]  the only way you can atone gabin for being a misogynist and a sexist is to adopt all our far
[03:02:29.960 --> 03:02:35.960]  left political beliefs well isn't that a coincidence yeah well it's ultimately about power right it's
[03:02:35.960 --> 03:02:41.560]  about telling you how to have sex what you can and can't do and i think that's why they embrace
[03:02:41.560 --> 03:02:47.240]  islam because the the jihadists are saboteurs so they're going to burn your house down metaphorically
[03:02:47.240 --> 03:02:53.320]  and maybe literally and then once they've sabotaged culture then i can get in there and i can dictate
[03:02:53.320 --> 03:03:01.480]  everything including how courtship works how all men behave what men say no that's like i mean they
[03:03:01.480 --> 03:03:06.040]  they make a list there's a there's a big medium article which went viral by k huck by the hell
[03:03:06.040 --> 03:03:10.840]  and rose and a sorry and she lists it she said right now you have to support black lives matty
[03:03:10.840 --> 03:03:15.640]  you have to stop watching non-ethical porn you have to stop using the term social justice warrior
[03:03:15.640 --> 03:03:21.480]  and feminazi you have to support abortion you have to be quiet as men otherwise you're on the same
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:26.520]  team as all these evil sexual abusers so it's completely transparent what they're doing it's
[03:03:26.520 --> 03:03:31.880]  like the professor with the new york times op ed yesterday you know should i let my kid be friends
[03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:36.840]  with white people you read his article and it's like yeah you should apologize for being white and
[03:03:36.840 --> 03:03:42.600]  by the way that's not enough you also have to adopt all my far left political beliefs so it
[03:03:42.600 --> 03:03:48.360]  always comes back to that over and over so it's a simple power play like you said it's so transparent
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:53.800]  what they're trying to do with this well his wife is white by the way that guy yeah so most of
[03:03:53.800 --> 03:03:58.840]  half of these friends are white as well yeah he's clearly friends with whites well i every time you
[03:03:58.840 --> 03:04:02.520]  argue with feminists about this they always say the same thing about all the fake allegations and
[03:04:02.520 --> 03:04:07.720]  again it's becoming a challenge here to separate all the stories because we sound like we're rape
[03:04:07.720 --> 03:04:13.960]  apologists here yes rape is bad that's why we have the cops go to the cops even sexual assault go to
[03:04:13.960 --> 03:04:19.640]  the cops anything untowards and it's it's illegal go to the cops otherwise i don't know you someone
[03:04:19.640 --> 03:04:24.040]  you didn't like the way someone spoke or you felt uncomfortable it's not illegal get over it you know
[03:04:24.040 --> 03:04:28.600]  we all have but but the one thing these these women keep saying is why would they lie why would they
[03:04:28.600 --> 03:04:33.880]  exaggerate why why would they want to put themselves through that and i say because i can give you a
[03:04:33.880 --> 03:04:39.640]  bunch of examples like jamie peck who built her career on criticizing terry richardson all right
[03:04:39.640 --> 03:04:45.000]  folks will be right back that full lengthy interview is posted at prison planet on youtube and at

[03:06:26.040 --> 03:06:31.640]  right now the footage you're about to see is really important because we're gonna be even more
[03:06:31.640 --> 03:06:35.640]  footage this just happened like an hour ago millie we were in gabin wins the camera guy
[03:06:35.640 --> 03:06:39.800]  both of them and trevon reporters just got back to the mothership here in austin texas
[03:06:39.800 --> 03:06:43.640]  hillary was here in austin today millie we were a reporter we'll give you the details
[03:06:43.640 --> 03:06:48.520]  she's also going to be up in dallas now and we first got the reports from the secret service
[03:06:48.520 --> 03:06:53.560]  last year uh that hillary was having convulsions every 45 minutes and had a black ambulance
[03:06:53.560 --> 03:06:58.600]  and that we should tell our listeners and everybody else to follow her around and get her on video
[03:06:58.600 --> 03:07:02.840]  that she had a medical tent as well well a couple weeks later millie and gabin in cleveland
[03:07:02.840 --> 03:07:07.000]  ohio caught her in a medical tent for an hour emergency stretchers people running through
[03:07:07.000 --> 03:07:11.720]  we have that video a week later on september 11th a month after we broke this news that she
[03:07:11.720 --> 03:07:17.160]  was having convulsions every 45 minutes she fell down on 9 11 in new york the media only showed her
[03:07:17.160 --> 03:07:23.240]  wobbling didn't show the fall and said we made it up but despite the fact they pulled it off the
[03:07:23.240 --> 03:07:28.040]  internet the video kept getting uploaded they had to back off that was a real waterloo for
[03:07:28.040 --> 03:07:31.480]  mainstream media so you went down there today i don't know if you're wearing your bill clinton
[03:07:31.480 --> 03:07:35.960]  rape shirt i was i almost definitely was and i triggered a lot of people you would not even
[03:07:35.960 --> 03:07:41.960]  believe there were a lot of um austin liberals out there lined up to see hillary clinton and
[03:07:41.960 --> 03:07:47.000]  she was very secretive and elusive you know when she even first pulled up they had a garage that
[03:07:47.000 --> 03:07:52.840]  would shut so that you wouldn't capture or see her getting out of her car as to maybe hide if she
[03:07:52.840 --> 03:07:59.480]  were to stumble or fall you you never know but it was very handled you had her whole staff there
[03:07:59.480 --> 03:08:05.240]  like a bunch of cult members and yes i did get harassed by her staff um they were stalking me
[03:08:05.240 --> 03:08:09.640]  following me around one of the private security was even pushing up into me and i had had to keep
[03:08:09.640 --> 03:08:13.800]  telling him stop i do not want you touching me and by the way by next hour you guys just got back
[03:08:13.800 --> 03:08:18.280]  in the last 45 minutes you'll have all the video downloaded and ready for the war with oan shroyer
[03:08:18.280 --> 03:08:22.680]  you're gonna be able to show all this uh but you were telling me that they call the austin cops but
[03:08:22.680 --> 03:08:27.480]  the austin cops when they got there what happened yeah i was like please call the police we're on a
[03:08:27.480 --> 03:08:32.840]  public sidewalk i'm allowed to be here talking to people that consent to talk with me and guess what
[03:08:32.840 --> 03:08:37.480]  they brought the police and the police were totally cordial and they ended up telling
[03:08:37.480 --> 03:08:43.560]  hillary's psychotic staff cult member staff to back off to you can't be in my space you can't
[03:08:43.560 --> 03:08:47.960]  be touching me and pushing your body up against me this is texas and i'm sorry to say i didn't
[03:08:47.960 --> 03:08:51.560]  new york where the police a lot of times will actually back the democrats you know being
[03:08:51.560 --> 03:08:56.600]  anti-free speech of course people can't see it on on radio but you have the right shirt down there
[03:08:56.600 --> 03:09:02.840]  uh of bill clinton which which became iconic in the election and uh we we had the contest
[03:09:02.840 --> 03:09:06.680]  exposing bill clinton's a rapist that probably turned the tide of the election it was our audience
[03:09:06.680 --> 03:09:11.960]  taking action that did that but alone you having her coming out of a deal and them holding her up
[03:09:11.960 --> 03:09:16.360]  and holding her by the arms clearly not just guiding her but holding her up thinking she may
[03:09:16.360 --> 03:09:21.240]  fall any minute fits into the photos of her being helped at the stairs or her falling down her face
[03:09:21.240 --> 03:09:26.600]  or her being helped out of the vehicle or or or in the vehicle and now donald brazil saying
[03:09:26.600 --> 03:09:30.600]  they looked at replacing her with joe biden because of her health and you know they had
[03:09:30.600 --> 03:09:35.720]  people stopping the front of the line from coming into the building so they were waiting for hillary
[03:09:35.720 --> 03:09:41.160]  to get out of her vehicle so that they can then have her stumble her way into her chair in her
[03:09:41.160 --> 03:09:46.520]  seat and then allow people in so that she could be sitting in a stationary position while she's
[03:09:46.520 --> 03:09:52.360]  signing and autographing books and essentially you know we're seeing somebody having to literally
[03:09:52.360 --> 03:09:57.320]  lift her it looks like the guy is lifting her up out of the car and again they tried to hide
[03:09:57.320 --> 03:10:01.320]  around the corner they tried to hide inside where they parked her they're being very very
[03:10:01.320 --> 03:10:07.400]  secretive just like the secret service told us there is a black ambulance vehicle uh that she
[03:10:07.400 --> 03:10:15.160]  uses now have we gotten uh mike sardvich on yet okay great because i want to get mike sardvich's
[03:10:15.160 --> 03:10:20.120]  sardvich's take on this uh before we go to the footage he's supposed to be hosting the sour
[03:10:20.120 --> 03:10:24.520]  i appreciate him letting us run into what he's doing at sardvich on twitter uh mike we've been
[03:10:24.520 --> 03:10:29.880]  on this from day one obviously we see the whole collapse of their structure the elite turning
[03:10:29.880 --> 03:10:33.560]  against the clintons you're going to be getting into all that coming up but what do you make of
[03:10:33.560 --> 03:10:37.880]  the new footage we've got that we're about to premiere other than clearly hiding her around
[03:10:37.880 --> 03:10:43.320]  the corner and trying to hold her up under her arm you know like like she can't walk by herself
[03:10:43.320 --> 03:10:47.080]  by itself you'd say yeah but you added to all the other evidence this is amazing
[03:10:48.920 --> 03:10:55.480]  yeah and then she she broke her foot by tripping down the stairs the multiple falls the scooby
[03:10:55.480 --> 03:11:01.000]  van people can go back and see that you and i and others had talked about the scooby van
[03:11:01.000 --> 03:11:06.360]  and they call this of course a conspiracy theory and even worse but that was from secret service
[03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:13.400]  sourcing everybody knows that within her because again it's all a drill it's all orchestrated well
[03:11:13.400 --> 03:11:17.080]  that's right and even under campaign events the last few months of last year they would
[03:11:17.960 --> 03:11:23.000]  all circle her and the crowd was in on it i mean we now learn we were vindicated this is true
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:28.920]  this is happening you know donna brazil also talked about how cult like hillary clinton's staff is
[03:11:28.920 --> 03:11:33.480]  and i can attest to you that i've been to multiple rallies multiple clinton speaking events they're
[03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:37.880]  extremely cult like and even today they were cult like in the way they harassed me stalk me told me
[03:11:37.880 --> 03:11:42.600]  i needed to leave while i'm on a public sidewalk they're cult like just like donna brazil said
[03:11:42.600 --> 03:11:47.320]  so why wouldn't donna brazil's testimony on hillary clinton's ill health also be correct
[03:11:48.280 --> 03:11:53.240]  and again if you're a tv viewer we are rolling this video here uh and we have it slowed down
[03:11:53.240 --> 03:11:59.240]  there she is literally it looks like being held up her arm then she's like oh look there's cameras
[03:11:59.240 --> 03:12:03.160]  so they take their hand off do you see they're shutting the gates they were trying to shut the
[03:12:03.160 --> 03:12:08.840]  gates and hide her completely walking into the event they did not want people this is amazing
[03:12:08.840 --> 03:12:12.040]  i haven't even seen this yet this is brand new you're seeing it for the first time
[03:12:12.680 --> 03:12:18.840]  wow yeah no i thought because i saw earlier on twitter that hillary had still been traveling in
[03:12:18.840 --> 03:12:24.920]  her big scooby van and they were walking her behind the van while a bunch of fans were surrounding her
[03:12:24.920 --> 03:12:29.560]  and as you know that that was standard operating procedure was they would say never let anybody
[03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:33.880]  get her get her on by the way where is that on twitter mike is that at sarovitch did you retweet
[03:12:33.880 --> 03:12:37.400]  that we want to show that right now to give us different angles of what happened show it tells
[03:12:37.400 --> 03:12:44.360]  where to go yeah yeah so jack was so big had that on his twitter account where um it shows hillary
[03:12:44.360 --> 03:12:49.400]  being escorted to the back of her big scooby van and i thought that was the video you're talking
[03:12:49.400 --> 03:12:56.920]  about because as we know the um the media doesn't go behind the van because that's when they have
[03:12:56.920 --> 03:13:01.640]  to lift her up and prop her up so if you ever watch footage of her getting into the van they
[03:13:01.640 --> 03:13:05.800]  always escort her to the other side away from the camera sure and you see them in the shot
[03:13:06.440 --> 03:13:09.720]  as they're trying to close the gate she's like hey look and they're holding her up and then
[03:13:09.720 --> 03:13:15.960]  they take their hand off i mean this is she is really ill yeah yeah exactly so yeah i didn't
[03:13:15.960 --> 03:13:19.880]  even i hadn't even seen that video i thought you were talking about this other video
[03:13:19.880 --> 03:13:24.920]  that i'm looking for and i'll retweet so that it's at the top is yeah this this is startling
[03:13:24.920 --> 03:13:29.080]  actually can we watch that video yes let's roll that video again for tv viewers radio listeners
[03:13:29.080 --> 03:13:33.160]  in full wars dot com forward slash show this was literally shot like an hour and a half ago
[03:13:33.160 --> 03:13:38.520]  millie got back like an hour ago uh and you can see it where they are holding her not not just
[03:13:38.520 --> 03:13:43.960]  touching her on the arm but holding her up under the elbow she sees it so they start closing the gate
[03:13:43.960 --> 03:13:48.440]  uh to basically cover up what's going on you know when a lot of times when guys are being
[03:13:48.440 --> 03:13:52.520]  gentlemanly and they want to help a woman like just to be cool you don't grab them by the arm
[03:13:52.520 --> 03:13:57.240]  let's your job by hand and like gently and then oh here let me help you you don't like here a little
[03:13:57.240 --> 03:14:04.040]  like let's your job by and grab a little girl yank you up by your arm you know she needed help
[03:14:04.040 --> 03:14:09.560]  obviously getting out yeah we found the video so i retweeted to my timeline so as you can see
[03:14:09.560 --> 03:14:16.120]  they're escorting her to the back of the van because they don't want to see anybody have her lift her up
[03:14:16.120 --> 03:14:21.160]  so it's amazing that we're going to show that when we come back from break here here's the footage
[03:14:21.160 --> 03:14:25.640]  hillary's still traveling on what appears to be a modified van i mean look at her hobbling out
[03:14:25.640 --> 03:14:30.600]  she's got a boot on that's what oh wow Gavin we have footage of that boot too so there's the boot
[03:14:30.600 --> 03:14:34.920]  i mean she looks like she's a person in a nursing home and then there's the ambulance there's the
[03:14:34.920 --> 03:14:40.360]  black ambulance and then she still thinks she's going to run for office in a couple of years well
[03:14:40.360 --> 03:14:45.640]  she's walking with a limp she already donna brazil even came out saying she has ill health or she
[03:14:45.640 --> 03:14:49.080]  well mike sarnovich great job milliam let you get all the new footage ready for the war room coming

[03:15:08.280 --> 03:15:14.040]  yeah well you know i think that video that you drew on was big i think that the the sexual
[03:15:14.040 --> 03:15:19.080]  harassment scandals are big the hollywood stuff is big i mean there's so much to talk about man
[03:15:19.080 --> 03:15:22.920]  sure but let me just say this i hadn't seen the footage that poesovic just put out it's somebody
[03:15:22.920 --> 03:15:27.640]  i mean clearly she's being helped out by them there looks like i mean i'm not being mean my
[03:15:27.640 --> 03:15:32.440]  grandma just died the point is she looks like a nursing home person yeah and the point is this

[03:20:39.400 --> 03:20:42.520]  hour i'm getting out of this segment even though i'm invited because i gotta go look at all the
[03:20:42.520 --> 03:20:48.680]  rest of this footage and i'm gonna be listening to mike but if you missed it here's the footage
[03:20:48.680 --> 03:20:53.400]  you tie this in with all of her other collapsing that she still has the ambulance uh that she's
[03:20:53.400 --> 03:20:58.760]  hobbling around with a boot on i mean she looks like she is basically living in a nursing home
[03:20:58.760 --> 03:21:03.320]  and look look she's an evil woman they tried to cover up her illnesses we're slowing this footage
[03:21:03.320 --> 03:21:08.680]  down there was one car millie was saying behind the motorcade that got in late so they were able
[03:21:08.680 --> 03:21:13.800]  to close the gates to cover up what was happening let's back that up again and millie and her cameraman
[03:21:13.800 --> 03:21:19.000]  gabin wench caught it on tape as she's being lifted out of the black ambulance which is a
[03:21:19.000 --> 03:21:25.080]  mobile ambulance but black so you don't know it's a black ambulance this is simply incredible millie
[03:21:25.080 --> 03:21:31.160]  tell us about this video narrate this for radio listeners and what else you saw well you could
[03:21:31.160 --> 03:21:36.200]  tell that by the way they were having her come into the back end of the bookstore they were trying
[03:21:36.200 --> 03:21:40.360]  to have it very discreet and private they even had gates that they could shut so that you wouldn't
[03:21:40.360 --> 03:21:44.840]  see it but like you were saying there was a tail end of the motorcade that came in late had some
[03:21:44.840 --> 03:21:49.720]  problems trying to weaseling through shimming through the gate and that's what allowed us to
[03:21:49.720 --> 03:21:54.520]  capture this footage but she could have clearly been dropped off at the very front entrance
[03:21:54.520 --> 03:22:00.600]  of the bookstore and she could have waved to her fans who were sitting out there sitting on the floor
[03:22:00.600 --> 03:22:05.400]  probably waiting for hours to come see her but that's not what happened she had clear as day
[03:22:05.400 --> 03:22:09.240]  being lifted out of the vehicle that's right which was what the secret service told us she's
[03:22:09.240 --> 03:22:13.400]  got to be lifted out of vehicles put back in that was over a year ago that she fell down a
[03:22:13.400 --> 03:22:18.760]  month after we were told and you've been on her tail you and gabin that's right and her staff was
[03:22:18.760 --> 03:22:22.840]  so cult like i mean look at them all standing right i mean obviously you have people there but
[03:22:22.840 --> 03:22:26.840]  but this guy here he was one of the ones that followed me around the guy with the beard
[03:22:26.840 --> 03:22:31.960]  followed me around the entire time where i was with along with that other security guy in the green
[03:22:31.960 --> 03:22:36.280]  and they were the ones harassing following me pushing their body up against me and what did
[03:22:36.280 --> 03:22:40.440]  the awesome police say to him the awesome police told him to stop they said you you know you need
[03:22:40.440 --> 03:22:46.520]  to keep a distance from her and i was very grateful for the awesome police and even hillary clinton's
[03:22:46.520 --> 03:22:51.160]  crazed female staff members that came and told me i had to leave right now because i was harassing
[03:22:51.160 --> 03:22:57.080]  and hurting people's feelings and offending people they didn't seem to care that these guys were kind
[03:22:57.080 --> 03:23:02.440]  of manhandling me in a way and that they threatened we're going to call the police i said please do
[03:23:02.440 --> 03:23:07.000]  call the police because you know i'm allowed to be here this is the public well this is hillary
[03:23:07.000 --> 03:23:11.160]  again like the secret service told us over a year ago having to be lifted out of vehicles
[03:23:11.720 --> 03:23:16.600]  mike sarnovich of the dawn of brazil all of it coming out the establishment turning against the
[03:23:16.600 --> 03:23:23.160]  clinton's what does this signify to you well i would like to know if the the media the new york
[03:23:23.160 --> 03:23:29.080]  times is going to report that a female journalist millie weaver was potentially assaulted in a major
[03:23:29.080 --> 03:23:34.120]  attack on the free press by hillary clinton's people i think that's very interesting that
[03:23:34.760 --> 03:23:41.000]  it's okay for a conservative or independent journalist to be manhandled by hillary clinton's
[03:23:41.000 --> 03:23:46.200]  i hillary's goons who we know have gone after women before that have been abused by bill clinton and
[03:23:46.200 --> 03:23:50.600]  it's not the first time it's not the first time i've been to her other rallies during the campaign
[03:23:50.600 --> 03:23:55.080]  season and her staff was always really crazy and attacking me mike what does this signify to you
[03:23:55.080 --> 03:23:59.960]  though the whole establishment turning against the clinton's what does that signify well they're
[03:23:59.960 --> 03:24:06.440]  trying to regain the moral high ground which they lost by defending anthony weiner al franken
[03:24:06.440 --> 03:24:13.240]  and frankenstein's monster kevin spacey weinstein the whole thing and they know that they realized
[03:24:13.240 --> 03:24:20.040]  hey we can't falsely accuse the right wing people of stuff if the real accusation can
[03:24:20.040 --> 03:24:24.840]  accusations against our people aren't addressed either so now they're going well bill clinton he's
[03:24:24.840 --> 03:24:31.080]  old he's senile hillary clinton she has parkinsons who you know or whatever don brazil by the way
[03:24:31.080 --> 03:24:36.440]  confirmed again i've never gotten apology confirmed that doctors who liked hillary
[03:24:37.080 --> 03:24:43.080]  were actually emailing about her health but again the fake news media well sir they fired one doctor
[03:24:43.080 --> 03:24:47.800]  that went public and said listen i'm not against her but you know this lady's got serious medical
[03:24:47.800 --> 03:24:54.360]  problems yeah dr drew lost this whole show remember that i mean the cover-up it really
[03:24:54.360 --> 03:25:00.200]  shows how high the cover-up goes as dr drew very popular he's a liberal by the way he's not one of
[03:25:00.200 --> 03:25:06.200]  us and he just said wow there's something wrong here boom show canceled the machine that's what
[03:25:06.200 --> 03:25:10.920]  they would do to protect but the clinton's aren't giving up and the and their minions aren't so when
[03:25:10.920 --> 03:25:16.600]  you've got an immovable object comes into the unstoppable force you get explosions exactly
[03:25:16.600 --> 03:25:21.960]  but now that the clinton's lack power they're saying well we'll just throw bill clinton away
[03:25:21.960 --> 03:25:27.880]  because he can't raise money for us even senator gill brand she goes oh bill clinton should have been
[03:25:27.880 --> 03:25:32.360]  a remove from office after the monica lawinsky affair which by the way no he shouldn't have
[03:25:32.360 --> 03:25:38.360]  any so she's now basically agreeing with the impeachment right even though she was with him
[03:25:38.360 --> 03:25:44.840]  all last year raising money cha cha chi well you know bill clinton was actually impeached
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:50.280]  for lying he was impeached for lying it wasn't the act actually of yeah no it was consensual
[03:25:50.280 --> 03:25:53.400]  with her i don't think it would that was an issue it should be an issue with christian voters or
[03:25:53.400 --> 03:25:59.640]  whatever they cover up consensual sex like it's the raping or pedophilia no it's not but then they
[03:25:59.640 --> 03:26:06.200]  don't want to talk about the actual cases like you know uh cathleen willie and exactly so let me
[03:26:06.200 --> 03:26:13.400]  ask you this question in my cernovich why are they trying to mix normal sexual relationships
[03:26:13.400 --> 03:26:19.320]  in with like pedophilia and rape it's it's not going to work it seems like an attack on heterosexual
[03:26:19.320 --> 03:26:24.520]  relationships in general attack on the family what do you think mike i think that's what it is yeah
[03:26:24.520 --> 03:26:29.480]  well i've said this before too and i know that it resounded because the southern poverty law center
[03:26:29.480 --> 03:26:34.760]  was really upset as i said the reason that they're attacking us is because they want to attack the
[03:26:34.760 --> 03:26:40.760]  nuclear family and that is why they were trying to destroy us whenever they can they want the
[03:26:40.760 --> 03:26:45.400]  degeneracy and also what they're what they're trying to do is they want to the washington
[03:26:45.400 --> 03:26:52.600]  post did this let's let's re-examine the roymour story if wapo had only run one story where a
[03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:57.640]  14 year old girl accused roymour of what he did i think i would have believed it actually but it
[03:26:57.640 --> 03:27:03.160]  was all package targeted ready and a bunch of us been proven to be fake yeah and then they then
[03:27:03.160 --> 03:27:08.760]  then they go oh and there was an 18 year old and then the media lumped them all in as accusers right
[03:27:08.760 --> 03:27:14.920]  so watch the trick the media did the media goes four women have accused roymour well no they didn't
[03:27:14.920 --> 03:27:18.920]  and if it if you go on a date with an eight if an 18 year old girl says i went on a date with
[03:27:18.920 --> 03:27:23.720]  the guy and we had a nice cream cone and he never did anything that's not an accusation
[03:27:23.720 --> 03:27:28.200]  there's nothing wrong with that right so but then they go oh but i mean the real deal is i think
[03:27:28.200 --> 03:27:33.640]  it's a little a little creepy but it's not illegal the guy is a the guy's a stud okay the point is
[03:27:33.640 --> 03:27:39.000]  his problem is he wasn't raping him he wasn't a pedophile then he'd be in the club yeah so i wasn't
[03:27:39.000 --> 03:27:43.880]  you know i wasn't defending him being 32 years old walking around in a suit in a shopping mall
[03:27:43.880 --> 03:27:48.360]  yeah i mean i think it's creepy and it's it's it's it's like a creepy studly guy but you know
[03:27:48.360 --> 03:27:51.640]  and there could be something real the point is if something real comes out we're gonna
[03:27:51.640 --> 03:27:55.720]  throw him overboard the democrats are still defending you know msnbc and they're defending
[03:27:55.720 --> 03:28:00.600]  al franken but in some of these states it wasn't illegal to go on a date with someone in that age
[03:28:00.600 --> 03:28:06.200]  exactly for me it's creepy but it is it harvey weinstein no what do you think mike well yeah and
[03:28:06.200 --> 03:28:11.720]  did you notice that gloria all read when she went on the news she said she wouldn't admit
[03:28:11.720 --> 03:28:15.960]  that the signature was authentic have you guys played that i saw that i had that in the clip i
[03:28:15.960 --> 03:28:21.240]  never got to it in fact well you know we've got that when we come back um grills all read over

[03:33:56.600 --> 03:34:03.720]  to not be with today because i'm not always able to talk with you on fridays because i just wrapped
[03:34:03.720 --> 03:34:10.600]  up production on a big film everybody's so busy that's the thing is we we do live in a golden era
[03:34:11.320 --> 03:34:17.560]  of media and journalism i right now am sitting on a bombshell story that will rock the halls of
[03:34:17.560 --> 03:34:24.440]  congress that i'm working on i'm here talking with all of you we're building a big film that i was
[03:34:24.440 --> 03:34:31.160]  doing that's in post production alex is building the studios out and this is why the support
[03:34:31.160 --> 03:34:37.160]  from all of you is so important and why the product specials matter so much because there are no
[03:34:37.160 --> 03:34:44.280]  outside advertisers for alex there's no outside advertisers for me this is all a hundred percent
[03:34:44.280 --> 03:34:48.200]  listener funded and a lot of people don't get it i hear from people in right wing media all the time
[03:34:48.920 --> 03:34:54.840]  you know mike i can't make any money doing this mike you know this mike that because toyota corolla
[03:34:54.840 --> 03:35:00.680]  corolla isn't going to advertise with right wing media with the media that tells the truth
[03:35:00.680 --> 03:35:06.840]  you're not going to get mercedes-benz you're not going to get bmw currig the coffee maker
[03:35:06.840 --> 03:35:13.480]  they even pulled out some hanity right hot dog companies pulled their ass and hanity you name
[03:35:13.480 --> 03:35:17.720]  it it's so that's why the support of the listeners are important but it's a two-way commitment
[03:35:17.720 --> 03:35:25.640]  right that's why i'm here on a friday on my birthday with you because your support matters and i thank
[03:35:25.640 --> 03:35:29.960]  you for the support that you've given me the support that you've given the whole info wars
[03:35:29.960 --> 03:35:35.560]  crew because there are a lot of people who are very grateful for all the support you are giving and
[03:35:35.560 --> 03:35:40.280]  you give that every time you order and you get stuff on autoship and you buy the products while
[03:35:40.280 --> 03:35:45.960]  they're on special subscribe and save caveman trupalia formula that's the product that i was
[03:35:45.960 --> 03:35:51.400]  plugged because that's the one i personally use with me i just don't plug anything right i just
[03:35:51.400 --> 03:35:56.440]  don't because i don't plug anything that i don't take but i know the caveman stuff is amazing
[03:35:56.440 --> 03:36:02.920]  it's collagen i've done smoothie recipes before with frozen berries smooth and smoothy recipes
[03:36:02.920 --> 03:36:09.160]  with a banana almond milk you throw in some caveman trupalia strawberry formula with some frozen
[03:36:09.160 --> 03:36:14.280]  blueberries and a banana and you have all the nutrition you need for your joints and other
[03:36:14.280 --> 03:36:20.440]  parts of your body and and that's the one that i i think is is the best and so thank you again for
[03:36:20.440 --> 03:36:25.960]  your support and and let's get back to well that is fun by the way you know i'm actually publishing
[03:36:25.960 --> 03:36:32.200]  an article today 40 life lessons when i turn 40 which is kind of like cliche but it's kind of cool
[03:36:32.200 --> 03:36:38.760]  those things tend to go viral and we do want our message of positivity to go viral i really don't
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:44.440]  like that people don't realize how positive and upbeat and fun alex says you see a side of that
[03:36:44.440 --> 03:36:49.640]  on the show but you know what we're doing is warfare every day warfare against the globalist
[03:36:49.640 --> 03:36:55.000]  warfare against the pedophile hollywood establishment very important to remember though
[03:36:55.000 --> 03:37:01.640]  to spend time with your family to reflect to be good to one another that's ultimately the message
[03:37:01.640 --> 03:37:07.240]  from me the message from the whole info wars team is we want to make the world better the fake news
[03:37:07.240 --> 03:37:12.120]  media they have to lie about us actually to make us look bad because all we want to do is make the
[03:37:12.120 --> 03:37:17.240]  world a better place we want you to be healthier wealthier wiser and every day and that's why we
[03:37:17.240 --> 03:37:25.480]  share real news where i gotta give credit to mbc i never thought i would say this but nbc did some
[03:37:25.480 --> 03:37:33.080]  real journalism this video you're about to watch i couldn't believe i watched this on nbc i'll be
[03:37:33.080 --> 03:37:37.640]  completely honest with you this video you're about to watch a journalist named katie tour
[03:37:38.440 --> 03:37:44.760]  actually does real journalism and confronts gloria all read about potential forgery accusations
[03:37:45.480 --> 03:37:50.600]  so i want you if you're at home listening very very attentively and if you're watching to watch
[03:37:50.600 --> 03:37:56.920]  attentively let's play that clip and then let's analyze it once it's over at this point i have no
[03:37:56.920 --> 03:38:04.520]  reason to believe that that that what he wrote in the yearbook is anything but his signature
[03:38:04.520 --> 03:38:07.480]  does your client everly on nelson remember him signing it
[03:38:11.240 --> 03:38:19.080]  she remembers his well she remembers being with him it was on the counter she alleges
[03:38:19.080 --> 03:38:26.360]  that he took it that he signed it and she was thrilled that he had signed it because as far as
[03:38:26.360 --> 03:38:32.360]  she knew he was a da and that was an important position so she saw him sign it at the time
[03:38:32.360 --> 03:38:40.680]  she had a clue whether he was an assistant da or a da but he signed it she took it as far as she
[03:38:40.680 --> 03:38:45.480]  knows um i mean there's no reason for her to think it's anybody anything but his signature did she
[03:38:45.480 --> 03:38:55.160]  see him sign it you know i don't i i haven't asked her if she saw him but we did describe what
[03:38:55.160 --> 03:39:01.640]  happened that evening in question uh that what she alleges was that she put it on the counter
[03:39:02.440 --> 03:39:07.960]  that i think that he asked to sign or that he did sign it that's all i asked this because it seems
[03:39:07.960 --> 03:39:15.640]  like you're not 100 sure that it is his signature and if you're not 100 sure that it is his
[03:39:15.640 --> 03:39:21.800]  signature why would you show it at a press conference well why would you know why does
[03:39:21.800 --> 03:39:26.360]  anybody doubt that it is his signature well Roy Moore's campaign is saying and Roy Moore himself
[03:39:26.360 --> 03:39:35.320]  is saying it's not his signature well he has a motive to say that uh and uh and and let him prove
[03:39:35.320 --> 03:39:42.760]  that it's not we have offered to provide it to an independent expert uh at the hearing which would
[03:39:42.760 --> 03:39:50.120]  be held in washington and uh and they we have allowed it to be examined so have you gotten any
[03:39:50.120 --> 03:39:57.560]  response from anybody i have no reason i have they have not provided me any evidence to suggest
[03:39:57.560 --> 03:40:05.000]  that it is not his signature all i've they've done is make this bold assertion that it's not
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:12.760]  but they have not provided any evidence whatsoever to us to uh support their assertion of course they
[03:40:12.760 --> 03:40:18.360]  have a motive to make that assertion because he is denying first he denied even knowing her
[03:40:18.360 --> 03:40:26.200]  then he uh he compounded that uh or confused that whole issue by saying something to the effect
[03:40:26.200 --> 03:40:34.760]  that oh well she appeared before him in a divorce case and uh apparently that does not appear to
[03:40:34.760 --> 03:40:44.360]  be accurate either when you wow i would i i'm telling people if you want to witness a master
[03:40:44.360 --> 03:40:52.760]  class in deception how to spot a liar just watch that video with the sound on and then the sound
[03:40:52.760 --> 03:41:00.040]  off can you say kd tour by the way all credit to kd tour i don't do this very often but i want to i
[03:41:00.040 --> 03:41:05.320]  always believe that we should give because that's integrity i always believe that as hard as i am on
[03:41:05.320 --> 03:41:10.040]  the fake news i don't have a problem with real journalism i have a problem with fake news and
[03:41:10.040 --> 03:41:17.720]  and i tip my hat to kd tour there that was a master class and exposing a liar gloria all read would
[03:41:17.720 --> 03:41:24.040]  not defend her client so i don't know what to say i'll tell you this 100 confession my confession
[03:41:24.040 --> 03:41:31.880]  time a story i got wrong when people told me that that yearbook signature was fake i'm going to tell
[03:41:31.880 --> 03:41:37.880]  you right away that i told people guys that sounds like a conspiracy theory i don't believe it leave
[03:41:37.880 --> 03:41:44.600]  me alone the idea maybe i'm just naive the idea that they would go to that length to forge a
[03:41:44.600 --> 03:41:49.480]  signature like this right so you can read my tweets where i told people that i believe the
[03:41:49.480 --> 03:41:56.040]  yearbook was authentic i told people that i thought it was a conspiracy theory to doubt it and now i'm
[03:41:56.040 --> 03:42:01.320]  the one who looks like the fool but you got to own your mistakes in life and i own that mistake i
[03:42:01.320 --> 03:42:05.480]  i accused a lot of people of spreading conspiracy theory about a forge signature
[03:42:05.480 --> 03:42:11.000]  here but gloria all read right there confirm the conspiracy theory she's the one who won't stand by

[03:47:16.440 --> 03:47:24.120]  and we're back with the final segment mike serve it you can find me at facebook.com forward slash
[03:47:24.120 --> 03:47:31.480]  mike sonovitch here to talk about and we'll call this segment how congress covers up sexual
[03:47:31.480 --> 03:47:38.600]  misconduct sexual harassment and sexual assault by its members this is very very disturbing stuff
[03:47:38.600 --> 03:47:44.440]  that i'm about to break a bigger story on probably monday we'll see it's a very big story
[03:47:44.440 --> 03:47:49.240]  that everybody in congress is going to feel it it'll be on the level of the susan rye story
[03:47:49.960 --> 03:47:53.720]  so stay tuned for that but what i've been learning is that if we click on to um
[03:47:54.760 --> 03:47:59.560]  read wilson had a tweet where the congressional office of compliance releases a year by year
[03:47:59.560 --> 03:48:04.840]  breakdown of harassment claims and settlements so we're going to take a look at this chart and
[03:48:04.840 --> 03:48:10.440]  for those of you just listening in excuse me for those of you listening in we'll just read it to you
[03:48:10.440 --> 03:48:19.800]  and those of you home can watch there is a star chamber designed to completely silence victims
[03:48:19.800 --> 03:48:24.920]  of sexual misconduct by congressmen so it's called the congressional office of compliance
[03:48:25.640 --> 03:48:31.400]  now under federal law under federal law any complaint a staffer makes against a congressman
[03:48:31.400 --> 03:48:38.120]  or congresswoman it has to be kept confidential it goes to this very quiet little star chamber
[03:48:38.120 --> 03:48:43.640]  where you don't have any due process of law government attorneys bully you berate you they
[03:48:43.640 --> 03:48:50.760]  do anything they can to keep quiet and then if they settle the lawsuit with you under law under
[03:48:50.760 --> 03:48:57.560]  federal law it would be a violation of federal law for you to go public with this so what are
[03:48:57.560 --> 03:49:04.520]  they hiding well we're about to reveal a lot of this because what i found this chart where they
[03:49:04.520 --> 03:49:08.840]  talked about the number of settlements every year there was one year i believe there was something
[03:49:08.840 --> 03:49:13.800]  like four million dollars in settlements i can see if i can pull the chart up real quick because
[03:49:13.800 --> 03:49:22.040]  the numbers are startling in 2007 25 sexual misconduct cases were settled four million dollars
[03:49:22.040 --> 03:49:28.920]  in 2002 10 were settled for three point nine million dollars and then in other years you have
[03:49:28.920 --> 03:49:36.360]  four hundred thousand eight hundred thousand eight hundred six thousand dollars big numbers now
[03:49:36.360 --> 03:49:44.200]  we the taxpayers are paying this this should be a way bigger story as bad as al franken's video was
[03:49:44.760 --> 03:49:50.040]  maybe some people could say what was a joke do i agree with that look you know i've said a few
[03:49:50.040 --> 03:49:54.840]  things trolling that i shouldn't have said let he you know i'm not going to cast a lot of stones
[03:49:54.840 --> 03:50:03.000]  but this is not a joke this is taxpayer money being paid out for the misconduct of members
[03:50:03.000 --> 03:50:11.480]  of congress many of whom are multi-millionaires they're using taxpayer money to seduce women
[03:50:11.480 --> 03:50:15.560]  and then when the women complain or when they're not being seduced when they're actually being
[03:50:15.560 --> 03:50:23.560]  harassed our money is paying them to go away and it's all silent so we have to get this out there
[03:50:23.560 --> 03:50:32.360]  so what i've done is and it's my pen tweet right now i'm offering a cash reward for a list of
[03:50:32.360 --> 03:50:37.960]  these settlements so i have said that i will give ten thousand dollars i would give ten thousand
[03:50:37.960 --> 03:50:47.000]  dollars cash bitcoin check whatever people want to do i want to know about these settlements
[03:50:47.000 --> 03:50:52.280]  the fake news media by the way has always known about this office of compliance in these secret
[03:50:52.280 --> 03:50:58.120]  star chambers but most of these people who are engaging misconduct as we now learning are
[03:50:58.120 --> 03:51:06.040]  democrats so the media rather than doing their job and finding out who is doing this and they're
[03:51:06.040 --> 03:51:13.160]  covering up for democrats yet again but they can't cover up for democrats anymore because now they
[03:51:13.160 --> 03:51:19.000]  want to come after roi more now suddenly they care oh roi more they got to go after roi more
[03:51:19.000 --> 03:51:24.200]  well where were they when anthony wiener was sexting underage girls which by the way was
[03:51:24.200 --> 03:51:31.160]  caught on camera anthony wiener is going to prison because he was caught on camera seducing a 15
[03:51:31.160 --> 03:51:37.960]  year old the the media reported that he was you know in a lot of trouble but they didn't report
[03:51:37.960 --> 03:51:46.360]  that he was married to umma he had access to classified emails classified information this
[03:51:46.360 --> 03:51:52.040]  man the sexual predator was almost in the white house he was a great friend of chuck schumer
[03:51:52.920 --> 03:51:57.720]  you notice that the media never called democrats and said hey chuck schumer do you disavow
[03:51:58.280 --> 03:52:03.080]  anthony wiener they said oh well we'll report on the charges against them but we're not going to
[03:52:03.080 --> 03:52:10.440]  hold democrats accountable you can't hold here's how the media plays it mike you can't expect us
[03:52:10.440 --> 03:52:16.520]  to blame every democrat for something another democrat does even when he was part of the
[03:52:16.520 --> 03:52:22.280]  clinton's inner circle even when bill clinton officiated wieners and umma's wedding mike you
[03:52:22.280 --> 03:52:28.440]  can't do that that's an unfair standard to do so we're not going to do it but then suddenly
[03:52:29.800 --> 03:52:36.440]  when roi more is accused in some cases of merely going on a date for ice cream with an 18 year old
[03:52:36.440 --> 03:52:42.520]  that's an accusation if you're a republican going on a date and eating an ice cream come with an 18
[03:52:42.520 --> 03:52:47.880]  year old that constitutes an accusation right but if you're 15 years old and you're you know
[03:52:47.880 --> 03:52:52.680]  sexually assaulting young girls 15 year olds and it's on camera well you know that isn't the
[03:52:52.680 --> 03:53:01.800]  fault of democrats well with roi more within 44 minutes our media had called every republican
[03:53:01.800 --> 03:53:08.520]  the senate and demanded a statement and asked them to disavow roi more who by the way is not in the
[03:53:08.520 --> 03:53:16.280]  senate let's be quite clear about this roi more is not in the senate so isn't it interesting how
[03:53:16.280 --> 03:53:21.720]  when it's a republican accused of something even if it's just merely going and having an ice cream
[03:53:21.720 --> 03:53:27.800]  cone with an 18 year old the media is all over it they're calling every republican you better do
[03:53:27.800 --> 03:53:33.800]  something about it you better say something about it but when it's a democrat caught on camera
[03:53:33.800 --> 03:53:39.000]  doing something bad the media goes oh come on guys you're being unreasonable you can't expect
[03:53:39.000 --> 03:53:45.640]  every democrat to take personal responsibility for what one bad apple did right it's always a
[03:53:45.640 --> 03:53:50.920]  bad apple oh it's just a bad apple even though over and over it's been shown that democrats are
[03:53:50.920 --> 03:53:59.400]  actually the real rapists democrats are the real rapists so yeah 25 senators disavowed roi more
[03:53:59.400 --> 03:54:05.800]  within like a matter of minutes because every reporter was on the phone calling them well
[03:54:05.800 --> 03:54:13.800]  how many report how many senators have disavowed al franken where's that story right that that's
[03:54:13.800 --> 03:54:17.400]  what the media and that's why they hate us and they want to get us all banned and everything
[03:54:17.400 --> 03:54:22.280]  because if it weren't for us they wouldn't even report it on al franken i called the media people
[03:54:22.280 --> 03:54:31.560]  out it was noon eastern standard time before chris l hayes dave weigel of the washington post
[03:54:31.560 --> 03:54:39.400]  madia glacia vox you name a high level democrat they waited hours and i called him a high level
[03:54:39.400 --> 03:54:44.840]  democrats because if you do work in the mainstream media for the washington post or cnn that's what
[03:54:44.840 --> 03:54:49.000]  you are you're a high level democrat it took them hours and then i'm on social media going
[03:54:49.000 --> 03:54:53.800]  through their timelines screencapping is saying look we haven't heard anything from these high
[03:54:53.800 --> 03:54:59.480]  level democrat operatives in the media and then suddenly they realized oh we're gonna we're getting
[03:54:59.480 --> 03:55:05.640]  caught well we got a band sernovich one of these days but until we have him banned because i'm like
[03:55:05.640 --> 03:55:11.480]  the socrates of twitter right i'm the gadfly i'm the guy saying well wait a minute chris l hayes
[03:55:11.480 --> 03:55:18.520]  you were just saying that every republican has to disavow roymore but now you're not even talking
[03:55:18.520 --> 03:55:23.960]  about al franken who is caught on camera what about that so using the socratic method because
[03:55:23.960 --> 03:55:31.800]  i'm the socrates of twitter they hate me and they do want to give me the hemlock and virtual hemlock
[03:55:31.800 --> 03:55:36.280]  they want me removed from the internet virtually and i do sincerely believe based on reasonable
[03:55:36.280 --> 03:55:42.520]  information that they do want me killed with literal hemlock if they had the power and could
[03:55:42.520 --> 03:55:48.680]  get away with it but luckily there are people watching out for us and indeed wapo even ran
[03:55:48.680 --> 03:55:56.440]  a column by kate harding who says i'm a feminist but we should keep al franken in office so this
[03:55:56.440 --> 03:56:02.600]  is an amazing column i encourage everybody to read it where she goes i'm a feminist i study
[03:56:02.600 --> 03:56:11.320]  rape culture and i don't want al franken to resign the mask is slipped off she admits it doesn't
[03:56:11.320 --> 03:56:17.720]  matter what you do you can be a rapist if you're a democrat if you're a democrat and you're caught
[03:56:17.720 --> 03:56:24.520]  on camera molesting a woman they'll even call it a virtual grope this was a great line from you know
[03:56:24.520 --> 03:56:31.720]  nbc because we we praised katie tour on nbc for actually asking gloria all read real questions
[03:56:31.720 --> 03:56:41.960]  another commentator on nbc had said well al franken didn't grope her it was a mock groping boy
[03:56:41.960 --> 03:56:46.520]  they really want to look at camera angles when it's a democrat right so even when you give them
[03:56:47.240 --> 03:56:53.240]  even when you give them a picture they're like well you know where his fingers technically
[03:56:53.240 --> 03:56:59.720]  touching her wasn't merely hovering at what yet nbc punn has said not actually groping is mock
[03:56:59.720 --> 03:57:07.720]  groping right amazing the the level of mental gymnastics will go through to protect their own
[03:57:07.720 --> 03:57:11.880]  so that's why i'm grateful that kate harding in the washington post said oh we know he groped her
[03:57:12.600 --> 03:57:19.240]  but who cares he's one of us and we will protect our own so keep that in mind when they call you
[03:57:19.880 --> 03:57:25.560]  the great listeners when they call you a conspiracy theorist the conspiracy is now out in the open
[03:57:25.560 --> 03:57:32.280]  where they admit that they conspire to cover up for their own side great hour thanks everybody
