[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:04.512]  You want answers?
[00:00:04.512 --> 00:00:06.073]  Well so does he.
[00:00:06.073 --> 00:00:10.255]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:10.255 --> 00:00:14.358]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:33.209]  Get informed.
[00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:34.449]  Be responsible.
[00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:35.290]  Use protection.
[00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.972]  Call Planned Parenthood at 1-800-230-PLAN.
[00:00:38.972 --> 00:00:41.153]  Planned Parenthood Administration.
[00:00:41.153 --> 00:00:41.953]  This is Lisa.
[00:00:41.953 --> 00:00:42.994]  And who am I speaking with now?
[00:00:42.994 --> 00:00:44.574]  My name is Lisa Hutton.
[00:00:44.574 --> 00:00:44.975]  Lisa Hutton.
[00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:46.155]  What's your position?
[00:00:46.155 --> 00:00:47.436]  Administrative Assistant.
[00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:48.697]  Okay.
[00:00:48.697 --> 00:00:52.819]  When I underwrite abortion, does that apply to minorities too?
[00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:58.602]  If you specifically want it to underwrite an abortion for a minority person, you can target it that way.
[00:00:58.602 --> 00:01:01.063]  You can specify that that's how you want it spent.
[00:01:01.838 --> 00:01:08.626]  Okay, yeah, because there's definitely way too many black people in Ohio, so I'm just trying to do my part.
[00:01:08.626 --> 00:01:09.868]  Okay, whatever.
[00:01:09.868 --> 00:01:12.571]  Well, blacks especially need abortions, too.
[00:01:12.571 --> 00:01:13.852]  So, that's what I'm trying to do.
[00:01:13.852 --> 00:01:17.537]  Well, for whatever reason, we'll accept the money.
[00:01:17.537 --> 00:01:18.298]  Okay, great.
[00:01:22.578 --> 00:01:24.119]  On a black baby?
[00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:24.499]  Yes.
[00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:27.760]  They've been calling Planned Parenthood all over the nation.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.401]  It's all some kind of horrible hoax.
[00:01:29.401 --> 00:01:30.241]  I don't know what.
[00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:32.302]  It's all a preposterous notion.
[00:01:32.302 --> 00:01:35.323]  We could face some challenges from, like, ACLU.
[00:01:35.323 --> 00:01:37.704]  And I want to make sure I don't leave anything out.
[00:01:37.704 --> 00:01:45.828]  I guess if you sent the money with a letter saying, specifying just exactly which groups you want or which groups you want this money to be used for... I can't answer your question.
[00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:47.188]  My name is Autumn.
[00:01:47.188 --> 00:01:49.249]  I'm the Director of Development.
[00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:19.190]  Thank you for calling Planned Parenthood of Idaho's administration and education offices.
[00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.932]  If you're calling to make a donation, please dial 1-3 and speak with Autumn.
[00:02:24.932 --> 00:02:26.993]  Your call is being transferred.
[00:02:26.993 --> 00:02:30.354]  Autumn.
[00:02:30.354 --> 00:02:31.534]  Good afternoon, this is Autumn.
[00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.831]  Hello Autumn.
[00:02:32.831 --> 00:02:34.632]  I'm interested in making a donation today.
[00:02:34.632 --> 00:02:35.753]  Fantastic!
[00:02:35.753 --> 00:02:38.676]  What about abortions for the underprivileged minority groups?
[00:02:38.676 --> 00:02:39.457]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:02:39.457 --> 00:02:42.660]  We have, in fact, wonderful, fantastic news.
[00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.164]  We just received a very generous donation to our Women in Need Fund.
[00:02:47.164 --> 00:02:47.905]  Wonderful.
[00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:51.728]  I want to specify that abortion to help a minority group.
[00:02:51.728 --> 00:02:52.589]  Would that be possible?
[00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.849]  Absolutely.
[00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.811]  Like the black community, for example?
[00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:55.232]  Certainly.
[00:02:56.056 --> 00:03:02.419]  Okay, so the abortion could be, you know, I could give money specifically for a black baby.
[00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:04.180]  That would be the purpose.
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:05.601]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:03:05.601 --> 00:03:18.007]  If you wanted to designate that you wanted your gift to be used to help an African-American woman in need, then we would certainly make sure that that gift was earmarked specifically for that purpose.
[00:03:18.007 --> 00:03:19.948]  Great, because I really face trouble with
[00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:21.171]  Absolutely.
[00:03:21.171 --> 00:03:22.192]  Oh, always, always.
[00:03:22.192 --> 00:03:22.492]  Absolutely.
[00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:44.007]  He's trying to get into colleges and he'll be applying.
[00:03:44.007 --> 00:03:50.330]  We're just really big.
[00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.271]  He's really faced troubles with affirmative action.
[00:03:54.271 --> 00:03:57.573]  We're going to play the rest of this later.
[00:03:57.573 --> 00:04:00.054]  Obviously this has been out for three or four months.
[00:04:00.054 --> 00:04:03.776]  It's so old hat to me that I have blind spots.
[00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.436]  I have to watch my own blind spots.
[00:04:05.436 --> 00:04:06.637]  We all do.
[00:04:06.637 --> 00:04:07.977]  It's finally getting traction.
[00:04:07.977 --> 00:04:09.018]  It's finally coming out.
[00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:15.072]  They, uh, student group randomly called seven different out of a list of hundreds.
[00:04:15.072 --> 00:04:18.153]  They randomly chose seven different, uh, Planned Parenthoods.
[00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:19.713]  They all said the same thing.
[00:04:19.713 --> 00:04:21.574]  Giggling, snickering.
[00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:22.834]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:04:22.834 --> 00:04:27.895]  Uh, it's all about killing Blackie.
[00:04:27.895 --> 00:04:30.096]  It's so liberal.
[00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:33.016]  It's so sweet.
[00:04:33.016 --> 00:04:36.137]  And of course, you'll never hear Barack Obama criticize it.
[00:04:37.837 --> 00:04:38.857]  No, no.
[00:04:38.857 --> 00:04:47.520]  There'll be lots of yelling and screaming about black pride, but at the end of the day, they know who they work for.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.401]  We'll cover this and a lot more.
[00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:51.901]  Huge transmission today.
[00:04:51.901 --> 00:04:54.222]  Stay with me.
[00:04:54.222 --> 00:04:55.642]  It is a big idea.
[00:04:55.642 --> 00:04:58.463]  A new world order.
[00:04:58.463 --> 00:05:02.704]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:06.159]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:08.963]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[00:05:08.963 --> 00:05:12.146]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:05:12.146 --> 00:05:19.475]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:05:22.492 --> 00:05:27.936]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:05:27.936 --> 00:05:31.818]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:05:31.818 --> 00:05:34.380]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:35.541]  Most people have no idea.
[00:05:35.541 --> 00:05:36.321]  They're not after money.
[00:05:36.321 --> 00:05:37.602]  They have all the money they need.
[00:05:37.602 --> 00:05:38.583]  They're after power.
[00:05:38.583 --> 00:05:39.744]  That's what I have to teach you.

[00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:52.312]  You have been warned.
[00:05:53.073 --> 00:05:59.859]  There are many types of storable foods, but how about a superfood that contains every nutrient that the human body needs for survival?
[00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:12.170]  50% protein, 300 milligrams of potassium per ounce, and calcium and magnesium for your heart and bones, with many more nutrients found in this incredible food source that the government does not want you to have.

[00:06:53.391 --> 00:06:54.272]  It's a fact.
[00:06:54.272 --> 00:07:01.877]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[00:07:01.877 --> 00:07:11.004]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[00:07:11.004 --> 00:07:21.552]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[00:07:21.812 --> 00:07:28.094]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[00:07:28.094 --> 00:07:33.295]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[00:07:33.295 --> 00:07:37.936]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[00:07:37.936 --> 00:07:39.757]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[00:07:39.757 --> 00:07:40.077]  That's 877-943-8600.
[00:07:40.077 --> 00:07:40.597]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[00:07:40.597 --> 00:07:42.437]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:52.682]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[00:07:52.682 --> 00:08:03.453]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:03.453 --> 00:08:08.418]  Yeah, about three months ago, a bunch of listeners sent me
[00:08:14.338 --> 00:08:25.966]  The Advocate, a student group out of Southern California that for more than a decade has put out a magazine predominantly about Planned Parenthood being a eugenics front group.
[00:08:25.966 --> 00:08:27.367]  It's not even a eugenics front group.
[00:08:27.367 --> 00:08:29.388]  It was founded by the top U.S.
[00:08:29.388 --> 00:08:32.770]  eugenicists, publicly funded by the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation.
[00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:34.131]  I mean, that's just mainstream history.
[00:08:39.275 --> 00:08:44.358]  They randomly called seven different Planned Parenthoods and got the same response.
[00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:47.699]  Laughing, smacking of lips.
[00:08:47.699 --> 00:08:48.800]  Oh, there's too many blacks.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:49.960]  I want this for blacks.
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.421]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:08:51.421 --> 00:08:54.523]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:08:54.523 --> 00:08:57.104]  And the people that run these, I've been around them.
[00:08:57.104 --> 00:08:57.664]  I've met them.
[00:08:57.664 --> 00:08:59.025]  I've protested them.
[00:08:59.025 --> 00:09:03.427]  They are literally some type of weird zombie.
[00:09:05.902 --> 00:09:12.289]  They are just the sickest, most wicked, cult-like people you can imagine.
[00:09:12.289 --> 00:09:13.130]  Don't believe me?
[00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.956]  Just go down and go into one of these places and talk to them.
[00:09:17.956 --> 00:09:23.142]  One has to experience the Matrix before they can really be told about it.
[00:09:23.142 --> 00:09:24.303]  It's just better to experience it.
[00:09:27.071 --> 00:09:30.112]  I don't know one black leader in Austin, Texas.
[00:09:30.112 --> 00:09:32.232]  I don't know one black leader in Dallas, where I grew up.
[00:09:32.232 --> 00:09:34.313]  I don't know one black leader in the country.
[00:09:34.313 --> 00:09:38.454]  My leader, somebody the media sticks out there.
[00:09:38.454 --> 00:09:44.236]  There's plenty of black leaders, but they're either assassinated or never even given any media attention.
[00:09:44.236 --> 00:09:53.398]  But the mainline pimps of the New World Order, you know, the minions of the New World Order, and they've got every major group's people under control.
[00:09:54.914 --> 00:10:24.154]  But the Judas Codes to control the black community they'll give fiery speeches about devil whitey all day, and they'll you know Thump their chest and talk about how Whites are absolutely wicked and devilish and cunning and hurting the people and are racist When an average the average white person's a guilty, you know chicken-necked limp-wristed person running around with a guilt complex
[00:10:25.299 --> 00:10:49.808]  rolling out red carpets for black people in my experience uh... and that i sit here and i go you know you have planned parenthood predominantly in the minority areas it's a mission and these are the official writings and letters of margaret sanger and foundation minutes saying that the black person is a weed and must be exterminated and
[00:10:52.193 --> 00:10:52.633]  It's big.
[00:10:52.633 --> 00:10:54.134]  There's letters to all these robber barons.
[00:10:54.134 --> 00:11:08.079]  She was getting millions of dollars, and that was equivalent to billions back then, to set up these foundations and how, oh, we've got to hire black front doctors because the blacks only trust other blacks.
[00:11:08.079 --> 00:11:14.622]  And then you find out the same black leaders then run off to China to help Mao Zedong come to power.
[00:11:14.622 --> 00:11:20.284]  It ties into communism, this whole network that the communist Chinese put into place there against their own people.
[00:11:22.432 --> 00:11:25.593]  And there's no doubt Bill Gates's daddy is the head of Planned Parenthood.
[00:11:25.593 --> 00:11:31.695]  There's no doubt he was one of their chief board members going back 40 years.
[00:11:31.695 --> 00:11:37.697]  There's no doubt IBM set up Microsoft as a front to launder eugenics money.
[00:11:37.697 --> 00:11:43.499]  There's no doubt the Gates's have given more than 40 billion of their own money and now
[00:11:44.969 --> 00:11:46.449]  Warren Buffett's given even more than that.
[00:11:46.449 --> 00:11:54.211]  I mean, we're talking like 90 billion total in the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and they carry out eugenics operations worldwide.
[00:11:54.211 --> 00:11:58.253]  There's no doubt who they are, what they are, what they do.
[00:11:58.253 --> 00:12:11.316]  And instead, oh, if Sammy Allred, a local talk show host, says, oh, people don't like Barack Obama because, you know, he's a blackie.
[00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:17.973]  By the way, Samuel Allred was endorsing him, liking him.
[00:12:17.973 --> 00:12:20.674]  But you see, he got fired for that.
[00:12:20.674 --> 00:12:22.835]  Because, oh, you shouldn't say that term.
[00:12:22.835 --> 00:12:27.277]  See, all this political correctness where we're just shaking in whatever terms we use.
[00:12:27.277 --> 00:12:31.099]  Meanwhile, though, you want to fund killing black babies?
[00:12:31.099 --> 00:12:31.840]  Or white babies?
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:35.341]  I mean, they want to kill them all, but it was started for blacks.
[00:12:35.341 --> 00:12:38.723]  You want to grab black kids with CPS and poison them to death?
[00:12:38.723 --> 00:12:40.964]  Hey, that's alright.
[00:12:40.964 --> 00:12:42.585]  The NAACP isn't going to say a word.
[00:12:44.247 --> 00:12:55.052]  But you, you say, I like Barack Obama, but some people don't like him because, you know, oh, even if he's a clean blackie, we can't have him.
[00:12:55.052 --> 00:12:58.254]  You know, that's a quote.
[00:12:58.254 --> 00:13:02.076]  Just that term.
[00:13:02.076 --> 00:13:05.858]  You know, hypersensitivity to things that don't even matter.
[00:13:08.371 --> 00:13:21.546]  Because really multiculturalism and all this political correctness is about all of us being up on tippy toes, eyes bugged out, watching each other, looking for some secret sign of racism.
[00:13:21.546 --> 00:13:29.115]  Meanwhile, Arnold Schwarzenegger can come out and say, I admire Hitler, I want to be worshipped at Nuremberg like Hitler.
[00:13:32.153 --> 00:13:49.299]  He can run around screaming and yelling down with the blacks, they're subhuman at events, to freak them out behind the stage before they would go do their posing routines, because some were bigger than him, and so he knew how to psychologically mess with them, so they'd freak out when they went out on stage.
[00:13:49.299 --> 00:13:54.181]  But the point is, that's all okay, it's on tape, it's admitted, he can even be in private
[00:13:58.012 --> 00:14:03.095]  Homosexual photo collections and in public gay porn magazines.
[00:14:03.095 --> 00:14:04.295]  That's okay.
[00:14:04.295 --> 00:14:05.236]  I'm not judging that.
[00:14:05.236 --> 00:14:06.917]  I'm not even making a determination there.
[00:14:06.917 --> 00:14:09.558]  It's just if any other politician had that, it's over.
[00:14:09.558 --> 00:14:13.040]  Imagine if Eliot Spencer was in porno mags.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.121]  He'd be arrested probably.
[00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:17.762]  He was actually, the evidence is now showing, anti-corruption.
[00:14:17.762 --> 00:14:19.283]  I've been doing even more analysis of it.
[00:14:20.698 --> 00:14:26.823]  Oh my gosh, over for him, but if you love Hitler and you're in gay porno mags, it's okay.
[00:14:26.823 --> 00:14:30.106]  And your dad was an SS Gestapo captain.
[00:14:30.106 --> 00:14:36.611]  That's the equivalent of a colonel, because they only go up to one general in the SS power structure, not that they have a bunch of generals.
[00:14:36.611 --> 00:14:39.333]  So a colonel is the equivalent of a brigadier general.
[00:14:39.333 --> 00:14:46.839]  His daddy ran an entire city and surrounding county, surrounding sector of Graz.
[00:14:46.839 --> 00:14:49.501]  And he went and arrested people and took them and did it all.
[00:14:50.251 --> 00:14:54.672]  And Arnie likes to wear Nazi belt buckles on TV.
[00:14:54.672 --> 00:14:55.612]  That's okay.
[00:14:55.612 --> 00:14:58.053]  In fact, the ADL gives him awards and says he's great.
[00:14:58.053 --> 00:15:07.034]  But you talk about how the New World Order funded Hitler and how top Zionists funded Hitler, even though there's best-selling books by professors on that who were Jewish, by the way.
[00:15:07.034 --> 00:15:09.035]  You're a Nazi to say that.
[00:15:09.035 --> 00:15:11.535]  You don't talk about the Big Dirty Secret.
[00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:13.176]  You're against killing black babies.
[00:15:13.176 --> 00:15:15.556]  You're racist.
[00:15:15.556 --> 00:15:16.536]  You see?
[00:15:16.536 --> 00:15:18.517]  You don't like Hitler, you're racist.
[00:15:18.517 --> 00:15:19.897]  You like Hitler, you're good.
[00:15:21.753 --> 00:15:31.937]  And literally, 90 plus percent of the time, it's a vast majority of the time, you go out, and I've been to these things where it's a Nazi rally or a Klan rally, and they're actual Feds.
[00:15:31.937 --> 00:15:34.058]  I keep saying actual, I know I overuse the term actual.
[00:15:34.058 --> 00:15:36.678]  I mean, they really are Feds.
[00:15:36.678 --> 00:15:46.202]  And it's come out that most of the, you know, the American Hitler and all these other famous guys, well you can look at them and tell, but it comes out that they're Jewish.
[00:15:46.997 --> 00:16:09.149]  And they go out and have little media parades and then freak out the inner city folks and freak out the quote minorities and get them all frothing so the middle class cowers in more fear no matter what color you are and says, okay, I'm for all the socialism, I'm for the welfare, I'm not racist, when the welfare is really used to dehumanize and enslave and poison and kill the minorities.
[00:16:12.429 --> 00:16:16.411]  See, when you're a eugenicist Nazi, how do you protect yourself?
[00:16:16.411 --> 00:16:24.095]  You run the organizations that fight the racism, you see.
[00:16:24.095 --> 00:16:29.097]  So you randomly call up Seven Planned Parenthoods and, I just want to get rid of the black babies.
[00:16:29.097 --> 00:16:30.838]  I just had a white baby.
[00:16:30.838 --> 00:16:32.839]  Oh, yes, of course, sir.
[00:16:32.839 --> 00:16:33.579]  Yes.
[00:16:33.579 --> 00:16:35.180]  Oh, we understand.
[00:16:36.704 --> 00:16:41.327]  And then all these big national liberal groups are coming out and saying, hey, Planned Parenthood's good.
[00:16:41.327 --> 00:16:42.548]  You leave them alone.
[00:16:42.548 --> 00:16:48.192]  They haven't done anything wrong.
[00:16:48.192 --> 00:16:50.453]  They're great people.
[00:16:50.453 --> 00:16:53.055]  And this is taken out of context.
[00:16:53.055 --> 00:16:57.218]  And this is just some new thing, and this is random.
[00:16:57.218 --> 00:17:03.002]  And it's just an accident, and those people are being fired who talk like this.
[00:17:03.002 --> 00:17:04.703]  Folks, it was
[00:17:05.615 --> 00:17:14.797]  Founded to exterminate black people.
[00:17:14.797 --> 00:17:19.939]  The founder of IBM donated millions of dollars in the 20s.
[00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:22.119]  That was billions of dollars then.
[00:17:22.119 --> 00:17:29.281]  Thomas Watson, who received the, what, Black Eagle from Hitler, the highest civilian award.
[00:17:29.281 --> 00:17:32.382]  Photos, all the photos with him, constantly over there up until World War II.
[00:17:33.952 --> 00:17:48.823]  Millions of dollars to develop particular computers just to racially, with health departments, track and euthanize and sterilize blacks in Jamaica, the U.S., Caribbean, Canada, surrounding areas.
[00:17:48.823 --> 00:18:00.852]  That machine was then bought by Adolf Hitler and the tattoos you see on camp victims' arms were used in the computer, your weight, your age,
[00:18:02.316 --> 00:18:21.209]  And other data, how many teeth you had, things like that, skin color, pigment, you know, did you have a flush, did you look healthy, that was entered, and given codes, and then the card would pop out, whether you'd be shot in the head that day, or whether you'd be worked to death, or whether you'd be kept alive.
[00:18:21.209 --> 00:18:24.452]  All of it, the whole grid, everything is run by them.
[00:18:24.452 --> 00:18:26.333]  They totally dominate.
[00:18:26.333 --> 00:18:29.075]  They rule with an iron rod.
[00:18:29.075 --> 00:18:31.357]  They have brainwashed and militarized our police.
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:55.982]  They have warped our troops in five years now, this week, in Iraq, and forged a dark army of hellspawn, filled with felons and illegal aliens and psychopaths who's been totally mentally broken, as a great black battering ram to ram down our gates, all coming back to be policed, to be unfurled, released.
[00:18:55.982 --> 00:18:57.143]  You know they are converting?
[00:18:59.821 --> 00:19:07.405]  Upwards of 80% of the troops to government jobs and the vast majority, go pull the numbers up, of them are going into quote, law enforcement.
[00:19:07.405 --> 00:19:13.849]  They are taking the influx of troops and hiring them.
[00:19:13.849 --> 00:19:20.933]  It doesn't matter what color you are, I know there's some sick white people out there going, good, kill the blacks, yeah.
[00:19:20.933 --> 00:19:22.234]  The other tool of eugenics,
[00:19:23.547 --> 00:19:27.229]  By these eugenicists, whites are seen as the ultimate threat to them.
[00:19:27.229 --> 00:19:29.670]  I'm not debating whether this stuff is merit or not.
[00:19:29.670 --> 00:19:31.471]  This is what they believe.
[00:19:31.471 --> 00:19:38.435]  You are seen as the ultimate threat to the elite because they believe you are more advanced like they are.
[00:19:38.435 --> 00:19:43.037]  And so that's why the fluoridation is targeted at you.
[00:19:43.037 --> 00:19:49.180]  To dumb you down because they say you may take over and stop what they're doing because you're up to the challenge.
[00:19:54.198 --> 00:19:55.619]  It is a big idea.
[00:19:55.619 --> 00:19:58.440]  A New World Order.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:03.163]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:20:03.163 --> 00:20:06.164]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:08.945]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:20:08.945 --> 00:20:12.127]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:20:12.127 --> 00:20:19.451]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:20:22.472 --> 00:20:27.916]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:20:27.916 --> 00:20:31.798]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:20:31.798 --> 00:20:34.360]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.541]  Most people have no idea.
[00:20:35.541 --> 00:20:36.301]  They're not after money.
[00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:37.582]  They have all the money they need.
[00:20:37.582 --> 00:20:38.563]  They're after power.
[00:20:38.563 --> 00:20:39.724]  That's what they're after these years.

[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.821]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:22:59.821 --> 00:23:02.822]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:23:02.822 --> 00:23:06.083]  It's not who votes that counts, it's who counts the votes.

[00:23:59.136 --> 00:24:25.521]  I was a highwayman Along the coach roads I did ride With sword and pistol by my side Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five
[00:24:28.046 --> 00:24:34.111]  But I am still alive.
[00:24:34.111 --> 00:24:36.192]  I was a sailor.
[00:24:36.192 --> 00:24:39.515]  I was born upon the tide.
[00:24:39.515 --> 00:24:41.696]  Chris Kristofferson!
[00:24:41.696 --> 00:24:43.838]  With the sea I did abide.
[00:24:43.838 --> 00:24:45.399]  I wonder what he thinks about 9-11.
[00:24:45.399 --> 00:24:52.344]  I sailed the school around the Horn of Mexico.
[00:24:52.344 --> 00:24:55.627]  I went aloft to furl the mainsail in a blow.
[00:24:58.186 --> 00:25:03.808]  And when the yards broke off, they said that I got killed.
[00:25:03.808 --> 00:25:06.648]  But I'm living still.
[00:25:06.648 --> 00:25:09.049]  Best part right here.
[00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:10.270]  Oh, Waylon Jennings.
[00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.610]  I was a dam builder.
[00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:16.951]  Across a river deep and wide.
[00:25:16.951 --> 00:25:19.792]  Where steel and water did collide.
[00:25:19.792 --> 00:25:24.354]  A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado.
[00:25:27.788 --> 00:25:30.449]  We're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:30.449 --> 00:25:34.711]  We do have big guests today, by the way.
[00:25:34.711 --> 00:25:38.973]  I should have told you this at the start of the transmission.
[00:25:59.221 --> 00:26:02.684]  Dr. Dina Dell is coming up in the next segment.
[00:26:02.684 --> 00:26:04.005]  We'll see if he shows up at this interview.
[00:26:04.005 --> 00:26:07.427]  I'm looking forward to that.
[00:26:07.427 --> 00:26:09.369]  I'll find a place.
[00:26:09.369 --> 00:26:10.029]  Perhaps.
[00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:11.150]  Yeah, Dr. Dina Dell coming up.
[00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:17.736]  Part three of interviews we've been doing with Jeffrey Smith at noon.
[00:26:28.035 --> 00:26:31.856]  About 40 minutes into the transmission from now.
[00:26:31.856 --> 00:26:37.218]  And Bob Chapman today for a full hour getting into the financials, really trying to break this down.
[00:26:37.218 --> 00:26:40.039]  It's such a big subject and so important to all of us.
[00:26:40.039 --> 00:26:42.800]  On the subject of eugenics, I'm gonna do a bunch of shows on that.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.400]  We've done a bunch already last year.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.341]  I'm gonna do more this year.
[00:26:45.341 --> 00:26:49.402]  We're gonna have the folks who confronted Planned Parenthood
[00:26:50.788 --> 00:27:04.177]  By calling them and having them drip with pleasure and enjoyment, you know, saliva dripping from their mawing mouths as they smack their lips talking about killing black babies.
[00:27:04.177 --> 00:27:07.560]  Unbelievable.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.321]  And so we'll be breaking that down as well.
[00:27:10.321 --> 00:27:14.584]  On the subject of eugenics, yeah, I believe we're all equal.
[00:27:14.584 --> 00:27:18.227]  I believe you may have certain variations and certain
[00:27:19.053 --> 00:27:25.816]  Groups of Homo Sapiens Sapien where certain traits are more expressed on average.
[00:27:25.816 --> 00:27:27.837]  And everybody knows that's true.
[00:27:27.837 --> 00:27:34.601]  But you're going to have individuals from any group that are of just incredible intelligence level.
[00:27:34.601 --> 00:27:36.522]  You're also going to have really evil people from any group.
[00:27:36.522 --> 00:27:40.964]  You're going to have a lot of mediocre people from any group.
[00:27:40.964 --> 00:27:48.668]  The sciences, you know, were developed universally all over the world, you know, regardless from Asia to Africa, of course, to the West.
[00:27:51.124 --> 00:27:58.067]  But the elites believe that the ultimate expression is the Nordic.
[00:27:58.067 --> 00:28:07.791]  And that same elitism or chosen people idea really resonated with the Zionists, and for some reason a lot of big Zionist groups fund eugenics organizations.
[00:28:07.791 --> 00:28:10.472]  You wouldn't think they would after what Hitler did, but they do!
[00:28:10.472 --> 00:28:12.333]  That's the incredible thing.
[00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:17.195]  And so when you get into real eugenics or criticize the real big boys, they get mad.
[00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:19.616]  You know, if you want to have blacks and whites fighting in the street with
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:24.423]  You know, ten FBI informants dressed up like Nazis, screaming, Heil Hitler.
[00:28:24.423 --> 00:28:28.145]  They love getting us divided and conquered, you know, fighting with each other.
[00:28:28.145 --> 00:28:44.416]  But the real target of eugenics, yeah, positive and negative eugenics, as it's popular taught, breed the elites better, make them live longer, look better, be smarter, exterminate, reduce, sterilize, abort, infanticide the unwashed masses, cull their numbers,
[00:28:46.072 --> 00:28:47.413]  And this is the elite religion.
[00:28:47.413 --> 00:28:48.153]  It's universal.
[00:28:48.153 --> 00:28:51.735]  This is what the elite's into universally.
[00:28:51.735 --> 00:28:56.397]  It's what all the top and ultimate leaders are for.
[00:28:56.397 --> 00:28:59.779]  And that's their operation.
[00:28:59.779 --> 00:29:02.700]  That's what they do.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:14.246]  And so they believe they are targeting the middle class, as they call it, that could threaten the hegemony or the monopoly of power by the elite.
[00:29:15.515 --> 00:29:17.256]  All right, we got a big guest coming up.
[00:29:17.256 --> 00:29:20.217]  I've been listening to this guy for more than a decade.
[00:29:20.217 --> 00:29:22.778]  We'll see if Dr. Dynadale does make it on with us.
[00:29:22.778 --> 00:29:23.558]  A lot of big guests here.
[00:29:23.558 --> 00:29:25.339]  Willie Nelson, Lou Dobbs.
[00:29:25.339 --> 00:29:27.960]  The list just goes on and on.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.021]  Got some really big guests coming up in the next couple weeks, folks.
[00:29:31.021 --> 00:29:35.983]  I'm not going to spoil the surprise, but you're going to be amazed at who's coming on this show.
[00:29:35.983 --> 00:29:36.603]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:44.454 --> 00:29:48.357]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:48.357 --> 00:29:51.039]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:54.099 --> 00:29:59.541]  It's progressing, and it's only a short time until it's completely taken over every aspect of your life.
[00:29:59.541 --> 00:30:01.462]  We are entering martial law.

[00:30:53.985 --> 00:30:54.445]  Fact.
[00:30:54.445 --> 00:31:00.490]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:04.833]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[00:31:04.833 --> 00:31:12.559]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[00:31:12.559 --> 00:31:13.320]  The solution.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.283]  Detoxification integrated with Electro Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[00:31:17.523 --> 00:31:26.672]  The LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[00:31:26.672 --> 00:31:34.880]  Detoxification works with the LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.

[00:32:06.997 --> 00:32:07.518]  We're good to go.
[00:32:26.075 --> 00:32:30.298]  The Last Word Monastery spelled M-O-N-A-S-T-E-R-Y.

[00:32:30.998 --> 00:32:33.220]  Or mail in your order to us at 4425 Schneider Road, Fillmore, NY 14735.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:36.142]  The total cost for this massive package of information is only $10.
[00:32:36.142 --> 00:32:38.363]  $15 for UPS ground or $30 outside the U.S.
[00:33:07.277 --> 00:33:20.867]  I hurt myself today To see if I still feel I focus on the pain
[00:33:23.741 --> 00:33:26.944]  All right, we're back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:26.944 --> 00:33:28.325]  He's with us for the rest of the hour.
[00:33:28.325 --> 00:33:33.591]  Dr. Dina Dell really probably doesn't need much of an introduction.
[00:33:33.591 --> 00:33:41.279]  An American physician and broadcaster in the United States who hosts the Dr. Dina Dell Radio Program, syndicated through Premier Radio Networks.
[00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:43.762]  Same folks that bring in George Norrie, Rush Limbaugh, and all of them.
[00:33:44.546 --> 00:33:56.115]  And he has got quite a list of letters after his name, first studied zoology at Cornell University before earning his MD from Cornell University, on and on and on.
[00:33:56.115 --> 00:34:00.859]  And so he's a medical doctor, written quite a few best-selling books, and we have got him on with us for the next 30 minutes.
[00:34:00.859 --> 00:34:01.620]  I'm going to be honest.
[00:34:02.555 --> 00:34:03.915]  I used to really like Dr. Dieter Dell.
[00:34:03.915 --> 00:34:07.856]  I mean, I've been listening to him on KLBJ 590 for like 12, 14 years.
[00:34:07.856 --> 00:34:09.677]  I, of course, am, we're on that station right now.
[00:34:09.677 --> 00:34:16.318]  Uh, and, uh, but I've seen him change a little bit and kind of his defense of the establishment, I think, intensify.
[00:34:16.318 --> 00:34:20.419]  So I wanted to get him on to talk about that, uh, today, but I do agree with a lot of things he says.
[00:34:20.419 --> 00:34:30.961]  Uh, just because the mainstream medical stuff, you know, hundreds of thousands a year die from the wrong prescriptions or medical mistakes in hospitals or cutting off the wrong arm or leaving instruments in people.
[00:34:32.014 --> 00:34:37.539]  At the same time, the alternative groups are a lot of kooks there, and they make the good alternative stuff look bad.
[00:34:37.539 --> 00:34:44.765]  Magic machines that cost $5,000, that are a piece of glass with a flashing light in it that con artists sell.
[00:34:44.765 --> 00:34:46.006]  I can't stand it.
[00:34:46.006 --> 00:34:49.729]  All the quackery, all the kookiness.
[00:34:49.729 --> 00:34:50.230]  I support
[00:34:50.908 --> 00:35:00.498]  A lot of the real alternative stuff, herbs that have been proven for thousands of years that have known effects and a lot of that, so that all gets a bad name because we put up with all of these out-of-control cooks.
[00:35:00.498 --> 00:35:06.304]  So, I agree with the doc there, let's just go ahead and go to him, but I disagree with him on a bunch of other issues.
[00:35:06.304 --> 00:35:08.046]  Dr. Dean, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:35:08.046 --> 00:35:11.429]  Oh, my pleasure, and I'll bet you by the end of our time together here, we're going to agree 100%.
[00:35:12.836 --> 00:35:14.116]  How's that for a challenge?
[00:35:14.116 --> 00:35:16.397]  I don't hear any other hosts that really do that.
[00:35:16.397 --> 00:35:16.917]  Did you pioneer that?
[00:35:16.917 --> 00:35:17.377]  I don't know.
[00:35:17.377 --> 00:35:19.797]  There's so much information out there to bring to people every day.
[00:35:19.797 --> 00:35:21.478]  It's a huge field and there's such intense interest.
[00:35:37.182 --> 00:35:45.107]  So, in a sense, the frustration is I don't have more time on the air to explore more issues, and it's really hard every day to pick what to talk about.
[00:35:45.107 --> 00:35:46.468]  So, it moved quickly.
[00:35:46.468 --> 00:35:49.250]  It moved quickly because, as I said, there's so many important issues.
[00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:58.956]  You mentioned a bunch of the most important, actually, and everything you said that I just heard you say, I kind of agree with you, but let's dig into it.
[00:35:58.956 --> 00:36:03.819]  Well, what do you think the biggest scams are right now in alternative healthcare?
[00:36:04.696 --> 00:36:10.402]  Well, the biggest scam, and let's be really, really clear, nobody wants to throw the baby out with a bathwater here.
[00:36:10.402 --> 00:36:11.463]  We have a method.
[00:36:11.463 --> 00:36:13.005]  It's called the scientific method.
[00:36:13.005 --> 00:36:14.266]  It's gotten us where we are.
[00:36:14.266 --> 00:36:18.751]  We can get in an airplane, we've got our computers, you and I are taking advantage of this technology today.
[00:36:18.751 --> 00:36:19.732]  We got here with science.
[00:36:21.052 --> 00:36:22.293]  Medicine's a little trickier.
[00:36:22.293 --> 00:36:22.953]  It's an art.
[00:36:22.953 --> 00:36:25.193]  You know, it's not like physics or chemistry.
[00:36:25.193 --> 00:36:30.275]  And so, you know, we have to be a little fuzzy in how we approach some of these issues.
[00:36:30.275 --> 00:36:39.298]  But to me today, the biggest scam, and I base this on science, I come from a long line of vitamin and supplement manufacturers.
[00:36:39.298 --> 00:36:40.998]  That's what put me through medical school.
[00:36:40.998 --> 00:36:43.899]  My family were among the first multiple vitamin manufacturers.
[00:36:44.617 --> 00:36:45.618]  In America.
[00:36:45.618 --> 00:36:50.102]  Of course, they didn't think it would be big time, so they sold the company, and that's why I'm still working for a living.
[00:36:50.102 --> 00:36:56.427]  But either way, you know, vitamins, there have been eight major double-blind studies that cannot be questioned.
[00:36:56.427 --> 00:37:04.773]  You give half the people phony pills, and half the people real pills, and both groups wind up the same in terms of cancer, heart disease, etc.
[00:37:04.773 --> 00:37:11.339]  We have proven that taking a bunch of vitamins every day does not help you, and yet more than half of Americans still take them.
[00:37:11.339 --> 00:37:12.920]  Then you get a piece of bull, like, you know,
[00:37:13.706 --> 00:37:19.330]  You know, Airborne, Secure the Common Cold, one of the biggest companies in America, invented by a school teacher.
[00:37:19.330 --> 00:37:22.252]  I don't know how she skirted all the Nobel Prize winners.
[00:37:22.252 --> 00:37:28.056]  And the more we slam these things, the more we tell people something is worthless, the more they cling to it.
[00:37:28.056 --> 00:37:34.240]  And like, as you say, there are really important legitimate herbs and alternative techniques that need the research.
[00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.821]  We need to investigate.
[00:37:35.821 --> 00:37:37.002]  And many that have given us
[00:37:37.438 --> 00:37:42.960]  You know, mainline pharmaceutical drugs and treatments that get swept out with the trash, so to speak.
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:51.303]  So, in a sense, the bad apples in the alternative movement are tainting something that could be very vital in terms of our future investigation.
[00:37:51.303 --> 00:37:54.305]  We're talking to nationally syndicated radio talk shows, premier radio networks.
[00:37:54.305 --> 00:37:57.786]  Dr. Dina Dell will fire out some of your websites here in just a moment.
[00:37:57.786 --> 00:37:58.886]  There's quite a few.
[00:37:58.886 --> 00:38:01.527]  I don't know which ones you particularly want to put out.
[00:38:01.527 --> 00:38:02.848]  But see, right there is where I disagree.
[00:38:03.570 --> 00:38:15.954]  I'm talking about people selling magic machines that they claim, you know, they've got flashing lights in them that heal you, or, you know, magic, just so much ridiculous garbage.
[00:38:15.954 --> 00:38:20.115]  People that claim this cream will make your cataracts fall off.
[00:38:20.115 --> 00:38:28.657]  I mean, there is just so much outright, just total scams, and they charge hundreds or thousands of dollars, you know, depending on the scam.
[00:38:28.657 --> 00:38:30.138]  And meanwhile, you just said vitamins.
[00:38:30.778 --> 00:38:32.439]  You know, have been proven conclusively.
[00:38:32.439 --> 00:38:44.802]  You can point to one study, I can point to a thousand others, where we know a lot of people, I mean, let's say people that have a junk food diet, we know that supplements are good, because they're not getting the nutrients they need, so that replaces them.
[00:38:44.802 --> 00:38:50.364]  I mean, I don't know how you can say that supplements and vitamins haven't been proven to help, because you've got... Well, it's easy.
[00:38:50.364 --> 00:38:51.444]  Listen, listen.
[00:38:51.444 --> 00:38:57.346]  I would challenge you to offer me one piece of paper that shows a decent double-blind study that vitamins work.
[00:38:57.346 --> 00:38:58.066]  I wish they worked!
[00:38:58.664 --> 00:39:03.846]  I just can't go against... So you don't agree with Linus Pauling, Nobel Prize winner, on vitamin C?
[00:39:03.846 --> 00:39:05.586]  I mean, it's what, vitamin A?
[00:39:05.586 --> 00:39:07.347]  It's based on your collagen?
[00:39:07.347 --> 00:39:10.028]  I mean, right there, we know that's the building blocks of your tissue.
[00:39:10.028 --> 00:39:13.409]  I mean, that's not... But it doesn't mean that vitamin C works.
[00:39:13.409 --> 00:39:20.011]  Listen, Linus Pauling started on an important line of investigation, so he really should be congratulated for that.
[00:39:20.011 --> 00:39:24.172]  But the truth is that the vitamin C studies have failed us miserably.
[00:39:24.172 --> 00:39:25.693]  Now, we're not talking about being deficient.
[00:39:25.693 --> 00:39:27.053]  Now, we've got to be very clear here.
[00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:34.141]  It is naive to assume that my parents made the same vitamins in 1935 that you're buying today.
[00:39:34.141 --> 00:39:35.042]  We've moved on.
[00:39:35.042 --> 00:39:39.143]  There are so many other micronutrients that are found in real food.
[00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:44.566]  You do not find in a pill that has vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, but there's so much more than that in food.
[00:39:44.566 --> 00:39:48.708]  But that's why green foods are good, because let's say you're not getting all the stuff you need.
[00:39:48.708 --> 00:39:54.631]  I mean, a condensed green food with a bunch of raw, unpasteurized, concentrated food plants.
[00:39:54.631 --> 00:39:55.571]  I mean, that's food, isn't it?
[00:39:55.831 --> 00:40:07.114]  Sure, that might be very useful, and I would love to see studies, and there's certainly no harm from it, but listen, the major... I'm talking these are studies of 50,000 people, double-blind control.
[00:40:07.114 --> 00:40:08.155]  We have found harm.
[00:40:08.155 --> 00:40:11.476]  You will get more cancer and heart disease with certain vitamins.
[00:40:11.476 --> 00:40:13.336]  I wish I could tell you it wasn't true.
[00:40:13.336 --> 00:40:18.898]  I want to downplay that aspect of the study, because it's not that harmful versus our slovenly ways.
[00:40:18.898 --> 00:40:19.558]  The point is,
[00:40:20.017 --> 00:40:23.023]  We Americans, we want the pill fairy to come rescue us.
[00:40:23.023 --> 00:40:29.977]  Why would we eat well and eat a healthy diet when what we really are secretly saying is, I want to pig out at the fast food joint.
[00:40:30.735 --> 00:40:35.157]  And I still want to be healthy, so I'll take these vitamins as opposed to controlling my mouth.
[00:40:35.157 --> 00:40:53.286]  Well, I've also seen the studies specifically about where they have these basically synthetic or artificial, you know, the junk multivitamins where it's not even the real, you know, plant-derived or food-derived, you know, thing that we're getting.
[00:40:53.286 --> 00:40:54.146]  Is that what you're talking about?
[00:40:54.526 --> 00:41:00.609]  Yes, and I would certainly hope that the new directions and supplements will be fruitful.
[00:41:00.609 --> 00:41:06.853]  But the point is, you would not get on an airplane if it wasn't tested to be reliable.
[00:41:06.853 --> 00:41:11.815]  You would not want your child sent to jail without evidence that your child was guilty.
[00:41:11.815 --> 00:41:18.259]  I don't want to loosen up the standards and just assume, because we get fooled when we make these basic assumptions.
[00:41:18.259 --> 00:41:22.261]  We have a fabulous food supply, and most people turn their backs on it.
[00:41:22.705 --> 00:41:28.126]  And they want these, you know, these phony supplement manufacturers to make up the difference for us.
[00:41:28.126 --> 00:41:32.027]  And the problem is, there are some good products in there that get swept away.
[00:41:32.027 --> 00:41:34.487]  But I've got to tell you something.
[00:41:34.487 --> 00:41:47.409]  You know, the phony, the rip-off machines and the stuff like that you were talking about, I'm like you in that I divide this into, I see caring people who really feel they've stumbled upon something and they really want to help and they market a product in good faith.
[00:41:47.409 --> 00:41:49.490]  It may not work, but they're not guilty of anything.
[00:41:49.490 --> 00:41:51.310]  They've made a good attempt and they're within the law.
[00:41:51.741 --> 00:41:56.446]  Then you get the scam artists, like you said, who are, to me, the same as someone sticking a gun in your belly.
[00:41:56.446 --> 00:41:57.487]  These are creeps.
[00:41:57.487 --> 00:41:58.648]  They take advantage of you.
[00:41:58.648 --> 00:41:59.729]  They rip you off at your...
[00:42:00.498 --> 00:42:07.181]  When you're ill, you're sick, and in your weakest moments, and they are in a different category, and yet no one seems to care about it.
[00:42:07.181 --> 00:42:09.422]  The law kind of allows all this to go on.
[00:42:09.422 --> 00:42:13.964]  The law says you can make any claim about the structure, function, or the human body you want.
[00:42:13.964 --> 00:42:16.325]  You do not have to prove efficacy.
[00:42:16.325 --> 00:42:18.386]  You do not have to prove safety.
[00:42:18.386 --> 00:42:22.468]  Now, you tell me any other area in consumer law where that is the case.
[00:42:22.468 --> 00:42:29.071]  Okay, Doc, I want to get into some other sectors of the interview because I don't want to run out of time here, but here's the problem.
[00:42:29.631 --> 00:42:49.566]  You can get Vioxx approved, a multi-billion dollar drug, and then it comes out that it's causing all these heart attacks, and if you look at the hundreds of thousands of deaths a year, and they can debate 150 one year, 200,000 another, you know, it's always moving, but it's always over 100,000, where they admit that drug interactions and drug problems from Big Pharma are doing this,
[00:42:50.266 --> 00:42:50.526]  Yeah.
[00:42:50.526 --> 00:42:50.687]  Yeah.
[00:43:06.977 --> 00:43:10.601]  Now shifting gears here, because I want to get into some other subjects.
[00:43:10.601 --> 00:43:27.939]  I have heard you on radio say, and I hear you almost every week, because you're on local stations here, say that there's no more thimerosal in the vaccines, but then I can go pull up the Associated Press saying that they increased the amount in the MMR, they increased the amount in the
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.821]  Flu shots.
[00:43:29.821 --> 00:43:44.133]  I actually did go for this interview, and I did go actually pull AP, Reuters, CDC reports that yes, since what, 2002, they're making available non-thamarisol vaccines, but the vast majority still are.
[00:43:44.133 --> 00:43:45.854]  So are you saying I heard you wrong?
[00:43:45.854 --> 00:43:48.817]  Are you saying that there's no more thamarisol in vaccines?
[00:43:48.817 --> 00:43:51.219]  There's no thamarisol in childhood vaccines.
[00:43:51.219 --> 00:43:54.742]  There is thamarisol in flu vaccines, depending on the kind that you get.
[00:43:54.742 --> 00:43:55.963]  But the more important issue is
[00:43:56.866 --> 00:44:00.248]  Tamarisol has never been shown to be harmful.
[00:44:00.248 --> 00:44:03.570]  Why are people concerned about the air and the mercury that we eat?
[00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:05.131]  That's where your mercury's coming from.
[00:44:05.131 --> 00:44:08.153]  We allow the Bush Clean Air Standards to fly by.
[00:44:08.153 --> 00:44:11.655]  Everybody's worried about their fillings and the vaccines.
[00:44:11.655 --> 00:44:14.096]  Tamarisol does not cause autism.
[00:44:14.096 --> 00:44:14.817]  End of subject.
[00:44:14.817 --> 00:44:16.498]  You've got proof to the other side.
[00:44:16.498 --> 00:44:18.459]  Step up to the plate and let's talk about it.
[00:44:19.469 --> 00:44:28.999]  Uh, and that is important, but there's no thimerosal, and since thimerosal has been taken out of vaccines in Denmark, in Sweden, and in America, autism rates have increased.
[00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:30.941]  So, it ain't thimerosal, and it's been pretty good.
[00:44:30.941 --> 00:44:34.084]  No, I saw that, I saw that, I saw that California study.
[00:44:34.825 --> 00:44:42.107]  And it just blanket said that there's no more vaccine, and so why did it go up from 2002 to 2006?
[00:44:42.107 --> 00:44:45.128]  And if you actually look at it, they didn't even check.
[00:44:45.128 --> 00:44:50.729]  They just took for granted that it had been taken out, and that's not the evidence we have, Doctor.
[00:44:50.729 --> 00:44:57.771]  And I'm going to actually take this interview and go through and write a story and add all the links to mainstream and CDC.
[00:44:57.771 --> 00:45:00.251]  But the point is, the point really isn't the art.
[00:45:00.251 --> 00:45:03.412]  Don't you care whether thimerosal causes diseases or not?
[00:45:03.928 --> 00:45:05.549]  You've got to care about that first.
[00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:08.790]  You've got to show me evidence that the marijuana is bad.
[00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:10.651]  Houston Chronicle, here it is.
[00:45:10.651 --> 00:45:14.172]  Health officials admit vaccines may have hurt Georgia Girl.
[00:45:14.172 --> 00:45:22.295]  Federal Blue Ribbon panel, this is just February 25th, this is just last month, found and ruled in her favor.
[00:45:22.295 --> 00:45:23.536]  This is a Blue Ribbon panel.
[00:45:23.536 --> 00:45:28.038]  Keep reading, but you've got to keep reading where it says, it does not imply that vaccines cause autism.
[00:45:28.038 --> 00:45:31.259]  This young child, if indeed, this is not a court of law by the way,
[00:45:31.863 --> 00:45:48.934]  That one case out of millions and millions and millions and millions, this child has a genetic defect that's very unusual, a mitochondrial DNA defect, in combination with something having to do with vaccines, not thimerosal, read it carefully, may have played a role in a single case.
[00:45:48.934 --> 00:45:50.975]  When an airplane goes down, do you stop flying?
[00:45:52.733 --> 00:45:55.195]  No, but it's such a... We've got to grow up here.
[00:45:55.195 --> 00:45:57.457]  It's such a... Let me finish, let me finish.
[00:45:57.457 --> 00:46:05.322]  You don't get technology that's white polio off the face of the earth, smallpox off the face of the earth, where is the theory of whooping cough, tetanus, where are these diseases?
[00:46:05.322 --> 00:46:10.666]  You don't take that technology because there is some flaw and it's not absolutely perfect.
[00:46:10.666 --> 00:46:15.750]  You drive your car because you love it and you're willing to take a 1 in 2,500 risk of killing yourself every year.
[00:46:16.170 --> 00:46:20.473]  Americans have got to grow up and understand that technology is not perfect.
[00:46:20.473 --> 00:46:22.235]  You have to be willing to sacrifice.
[00:46:22.235 --> 00:46:22.915]  Let me stop you.
[00:46:22.915 --> 00:46:23.896]  Let me stop you.
[00:46:23.896 --> 00:46:28.139]  There are actually, and if you'd like, actually about 50 of them here in front of me.
[00:46:28.139 --> 00:46:33.423]  I mean, you can just say there's not a study, there's no proof, there's no evidence.
[00:46:33.423 --> 00:46:38.446]  All I know, and then you can say, well, we over-report autism, you know, brain disorders.
[00:46:38.446 --> 00:46:40.648]  Now, that's why we've gone from 1 in 25,000 20 years ago to
[00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:48.330]  One in 168 five years ago, to now one in 75 federal numbers.
[00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:57.913]  And then just, I go on the hike and bike trail, I go to the mall, I take my children to see Ratatouille, and there's 200 kids in there, and the front two rows are autistic children.
[00:46:57.913 --> 00:47:03.374]  They have huge wings of every major school now, with children nodding and drooling in the corner.
[00:47:03.374 --> 00:47:04.694]  What is doing it, Doc?
[00:47:04.694 --> 00:47:07.155]  How come there's just suddenly all these autistic kids everywhere?
[00:47:07.155 --> 00:47:07.675]  Right, right.
[00:47:07.675 --> 00:47:11.856]  But because it's increased, doesn't mean... But did the Tooth Fairy do this?
[00:47:12.802 --> 00:47:13.843]  Did the two-third do what?
[00:47:13.843 --> 00:47:14.884]  Increase autism?
[00:47:14.884 --> 00:47:21.088]  I mean, I'm asking... No, because... But don't you want to... But listen, I want to find out why and what's going on to waste all this time.
[00:47:21.088 --> 00:47:23.089]  I don't even need scientific studies.
[00:47:23.089 --> 00:47:25.491]  I've talked to... And I've got them, by the way.
[00:47:25.491 --> 00:47:27.272]  I mean, I'll be at a shopping mall.
[00:47:27.272 --> 00:47:28.473]  I'll be on vacation.
[00:47:28.473 --> 00:47:30.374]  There's a lady there at the pool.
[00:47:30.374 --> 00:47:32.776]  She's got an autistic son.
[00:47:32.776 --> 00:47:34.737]  And I walk over and I say, when did this happen?
[00:47:34.737 --> 00:47:36.058]  Oh, he was 18 months old.
[00:47:36.058 --> 00:47:36.519]  Let me guess.
[00:47:37.379 --> 00:47:38.980]  Uh, he had a convulsion that night.
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:39.861]  She goes, how do you know?
[00:47:39.861 --> 00:47:40.741]  Do you know me?
[00:47:40.741 --> 00:47:41.281]  Who are you?
[00:47:41.281 --> 00:47:47.145]  He had a convulsion after that, and then, and I said, oh, let me guess, the hospital tried to take your kid, saying you shook him.
[00:47:47.145 --> 00:47:52.108]  Man, what, why is it they get the shot and sometimes have a convulsion in the hospital?
[00:47:52.108 --> 00:47:54.929]  Listen, this is a, it's a common reasoning fallacy.
[00:47:54.929 --> 00:48:04.555]  There are so many shots that are given to kids, there is, nothing can happen in the child that isn't a week or two after a shot, or a week or two before the shot, and it sure seems like there's a relationship.
[00:48:04.995 --> 00:48:06.817]  It sure seems like it.
[00:48:06.817 --> 00:48:09.318]  And if there is, we need to find out.
[00:48:09.318 --> 00:48:19.786]  But we're just wasting and spinning our wheels not getting to the bottom of autism by constantly having to put down a theory that kind of came and it kind of went.
[00:48:19.786 --> 00:48:20.667]  So let's move on.
[00:48:20.667 --> 00:48:23.249]  Why is it that older fathers have more autistic kids?
[00:48:23.249 --> 00:48:25.731]  Why is it that women have certain obstetrical problems?
[00:48:25.731 --> 00:48:27.372]  Well, obviously they know.
[00:48:27.372 --> 00:48:33.297]  Well, the studies you just mentioned them show that it is a genetic defect mainly manifest in boys.
[00:48:33.977 --> 00:48:39.282]  And that it has something to do with the absorption and the passing into the cells of the mercury.
[00:48:39.282 --> 00:48:52.272]  And you're right, the coal-burning plants, they've taken the restrictions off, Texas supplies five states, I'm sitting in the middle of it, and the mercury readings are off the chart, meanwhile the global warming people are running around wanting to tax carbon dioxide that plants breathe.
[00:48:52.272 --> 00:48:54.915]  Yeah, yeah, listen, I agree with you, I agree with you on that.
[00:48:54.915 --> 00:48:56.476]  The point is that it
[00:48:56.966 --> 00:49:00.548]  You, we don't come up with scientific conclusions by public proclamation.
[00:49:00.548 --> 00:49:01.969]  We have to come up with it.
[00:49:01.969 --> 00:49:11.396]  I hate to keep reducing it to sound so cold and hardcore, but we can't allow ourselves to take our eye off the ball, and that is...
[00:49:11.946 --> 00:49:13.947]  We've got to prove what's going on.
[00:49:13.947 --> 00:49:15.628]  We've got to find out what's going on.
[00:49:15.628 --> 00:49:24.814]  It sure seems ambitious, I know, but after eight major large studies with no medical group in the world, you've got to... Hold on, hold on.
[00:49:24.814 --> 00:49:27.136]  Funded by the big vaccine makers.
[00:49:27.136 --> 00:49:28.156]  But let me just stop you.
[00:49:28.156 --> 00:49:30.478]  Let me just throw this out before we go to breaking of the final segment.
[00:49:30.478 --> 00:49:31.058]  It's already gone.
[00:49:31.058 --> 00:49:32.179]  I've got to have you back up sometime.
[00:49:32.179 --> 00:49:33.620]  We've got to... Oh, this is fun.
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:35.581]  And we'll plug your sites on the other side of this.
[00:49:35.581 --> 00:49:36.522]  Be sure to do that.
[00:49:36.522 --> 00:49:37.002]  Here's the deal.
[00:49:38.661 --> 00:49:42.243]  We have all the fraud in the FDA, in the EPA.
[00:49:42.243 --> 00:49:47.606]  We have the revolving door of big pharma people back and forth approving their bad drugs.
[00:49:47.606 --> 00:49:53.648]  We know they're predatory against the supplements, regardless, because they're in competition with them.
[00:49:53.648 --> 00:49:58.110]  And then we have the Tuskegee experiment, eugenics, sterilization in this country.
[00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:01.472]  We know Hitler got his ideas from England and the U.S.
[00:50:01.472 --> 00:50:05.474]  I don't have this all-trusting view of whatever the guys in white lab coats say.
[00:50:05.874 --> 00:50:07.836]  No, I think that's good.
[00:50:07.836 --> 00:50:09.957]  I think you should not trust authority.
[00:50:09.957 --> 00:50:14.801]  And they do screw up, and they do make mistakes, whatever walk of life you're in.
[00:50:14.801 --> 00:50:16.963]  And there is fraud, and it happens.
[00:50:16.963 --> 00:50:18.124]  There's no doubt about it.
[00:50:18.124 --> 00:50:31.435]  But talking about throwing the baby out with the bathwater, of course, just because there is fraud, because there are illegal and fraudulent ties behind the scenes, doesn't mean that everything that comes from mainstream science
[00:50:31.975 --> 00:50:33.077]  Okay, it's fraudulent.
[00:50:33.077 --> 00:50:34.099]  I'm not saying that.
[00:50:34.099 --> 00:50:35.000]  I'm not saying that.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:35.601]  I'm not saying that.
[00:50:35.601 --> 00:50:36.162]  We'll stay there.
[00:50:36.162 --> 00:50:38.746]  Final segment with Dr. Dina Dell after this three-minute break.
[00:50:38.746 --> 00:50:44.855]  I gotta get him back up for longer because he's a great debater and there's so many points I want to bring up.
[00:50:44.855 --> 00:50:46.878]  I know he's got a lot of documents as well.
[00:50:46.878 --> 00:50:47.459]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:54.318 --> 00:50:56.320]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.943]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[00:50:59.943 --> 00:51:02.406]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[00:51:02.406 --> 00:51:05.469]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[00:51:05.469 --> 00:51:11.254]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[00:51:11.254 --> 00:51:15.198]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.520]  Let me get this straight.

[00:51:59.701 --> 00:52:00.721]  Like Star Wars?
[00:52:00.721 --> 00:52:01.561]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:52:01.561 --> 00:52:02.742]  Slightly in the future.
[00:52:02.742 --> 00:52:03.842]  Wait a second.
[00:52:03.842 --> 00:52:07.083]  I thought Star Wars took place a long, long time ago.
[00:52:07.083 --> 00:52:08.143]  Alright, Einstein.
[00:52:08.143 --> 00:52:10.323]  But it is kind of like Star Wars anyway.
[00:52:10.323 --> 00:52:16.945]  Just like Star Wars, there's an evil empire and some people have started an armed rebellion to fight the evil empire.
[00:52:17.225 --> 00:52:20.328]  Okay, so don't tell me, the government's the bad guys again?
[00:52:20.328 --> 00:52:21.649]  Yep, that's right.
[00:52:21.649 --> 00:52:24.351]  Oh, so your character's like Luke Skywalker?
[00:52:24.351 --> 00:52:25.412]  Not exactly.
[00:52:25.412 --> 00:52:27.513]  I know, you're Chewbacca!
[00:52:27.513 --> 00:52:36.601]  Not really, but my character does help the rebellion to stop the government's evil tracking system, which is happening now in the real world, just like in Uncivil Liberties.
[00:52:36.601 --> 00:52:39.763]  Wait a second, they can't track us, it's a free country!
[00:52:39.763 --> 00:52:40.344]  Exactly.
[00:52:41.312 --> 00:52:45.115]  Uncivil Liberties, a political thriller ripped from today's headlines.

[00:53:41.397 --> 00:53:42.558]  Federal agents!
[00:53:42.558 --> 00:53:43.519]  We are armed!
[00:54:01.477 --> 00:54:02.758]  Alright folks, I'm going to move quick.
[00:54:02.758 --> 00:54:04.900]  Dr. David Elder with us into the next segment.
[00:54:04.900 --> 00:54:07.422]  Another 10 minutes with him, we appreciate that.
[00:54:07.422 --> 00:54:11.085]  And you can just find him on any AM or FM station that carries talk.
[00:54:11.085 --> 00:54:14.108]  He's in every major city and most small towns.
[00:54:14.108 --> 00:54:18.351]  He's on 590 KLBJ here in Austin, one of our affiliates.
[00:54:18.351 --> 00:54:22.615]  Now, of course we're on 1330 right now and then of course on the weekend on 590.
[00:54:25.925 --> 00:54:30.586]  Moving quicker here, let's take sodium fluoride.
[00:54:30.586 --> 00:54:44.571]  I just said to you during the break, did you know that they take the whole waste from the aluminum and of course fertilizer manufacturer and then that's what they call fluoride that they then put in the water.
[00:54:44.571 --> 00:54:45.711]  And you said, I've never heard that.
[00:54:46.334 --> 00:54:54.798]  I'm going to make sure you get emailed all the mainstream documentation and the head of epidemiology departments and FDA investigators all saying it.
[00:54:54.798 --> 00:55:01.421]  I mean, did you hear about the American Dental Association coming out a year and a half ago and saying, don't give babies fluoride water?
[00:55:01.421 --> 00:55:03.022]  Right, because they're getting plenty of it.
[00:55:03.022 --> 00:55:05.423]  They're getting plenty of it as it is, and you've got to be very careful.
[00:55:05.423 --> 00:55:10.705]  Now, if you're saying that they use waste material to produce fluoride,
[00:55:11.437 --> 00:55:16.860]  I wouldn't be surprised, but the same token, I can take water from your toilet after you flush.
[00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:18.101]  I can reduce pure water.
[00:55:18.101 --> 00:55:20.323]  And you might say, hey, I'm drinking sewage here.
[00:55:20.323 --> 00:55:21.543]  No, you're drinking pure water.
[00:55:21.543 --> 00:55:23.785]  It's just been processed, manufactured, etc.
[00:55:23.785 --> 00:55:25.466]  So I'm not exactly sure what they use.
[00:55:26.153 --> 00:55:27.694]  Um, to make fluoride.
[00:55:27.694 --> 00:55:30.875]  And there are people in America that are getting too much fluoride.
[00:55:30.875 --> 00:55:33.596]  You see those little white spots on kids' front teeth.
[00:55:33.596 --> 00:55:34.436]  Rotholes.
[00:55:34.436 --> 00:55:37.157]  And that often comes, uh, can come from fluoride.
[00:55:37.157 --> 00:55:38.277]  Well, you've got fluorosis.
[00:55:38.277 --> 00:55:45.740]  Well, there's this big Harvard situation where the graduate doctor did the report about increased, uh, the, uh, type of bone cancer.
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:46.880]  But that's not a new debate.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:55.263]  I've seen a bunch of mainline university studies from China to Japan to England where it causes massive increases in that type of cancer in boys.
[00:55:55.703 --> 00:55:56.584]  No, wait a second.
[00:55:56.584 --> 00:55:57.444]  Massive increases.
[00:55:57.444 --> 00:56:01.026]  You've got to be careful with that in terms of implying cause and effect.
[00:56:01.026 --> 00:56:04.728]  It might seem so, but to my knowledge... Doubling, tripling, depending on the study.
[00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:06.649]  Yeah, well, I doubt it.
[00:56:06.649 --> 00:56:08.110]  How's that?
[00:56:08.110 --> 00:56:09.330]  But do you have those in front of you?
[00:56:09.330 --> 00:56:11.111]  I have an excess, but excess amount.
[00:56:11.111 --> 00:56:17.535]  Listen, when you start doing studies, here's something the pharmaceutical companies do all the time.
[00:56:17.535 --> 00:56:20.216]  Let's suppose I have a drug and I'm putting it on the market.
[00:56:20.868 --> 00:56:26.230]  And I do eight studies in a row to find this drug's a piece of crap, and it's causing side effects and killing people.
[00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:30.071]  And then the eighth and the ninth study finds, which we tweak the study, right?
[00:56:30.071 --> 00:56:32.932]  Find out, hey, this is a great drug and doesn't cause side effects.
[00:56:32.932 --> 00:56:34.873]  What do you think is going to get published?
[00:56:34.873 --> 00:56:42.375]  You've got to be very, very careful in that you look at, and this is what's difficult, the entire body of the literature.
[00:56:42.375 --> 00:56:47.517]  There are people in America today, the membership is 650, who still believe the Earth is flat.
[00:56:48.115 --> 00:56:49.819]  And they do their studies to produce it.
[00:56:49.819 --> 00:56:51.302]  I would not offer that as evidence.
[00:56:51.302 --> 00:56:55.691]  I would not say it's a controversy when 99.99% of scientists believe one thing and 0.01% believe another.
[00:56:59.924 --> 00:57:05.666]  Why is it in America we want to go, because we love the underdog, if we want to go with a 0.01%?
[00:57:05.666 --> 00:57:15.808]  Dr. Dean, you're doing what the big, and that's just pushing it, you know, the big governments and banks are doing, pushing for a global carbon tax while ignoring all the real toxic waste and the rest of it.
[00:57:15.808 --> 00:57:28.352]  They say every scientist agrees with man-made global warming, when that's actually not the truth, it's the opposite, that the vast majority believe it's not man-made, it's the sun cycle, and so you're saying everybody, you know, they all know that
[00:57:29.373 --> 00:57:30.514]  I'll put it to you another way.
[00:57:30.514 --> 00:57:41.243]  Tell me the last time that you saw in the history of science, because I know a few examples here, when you saw that 0.1% of scientists turn out to be right.
[00:57:41.243 --> 00:57:44.986]  And if they turned out to be right, by the way, they proved their case.
[00:57:44.986 --> 00:57:48.689]  But it isn't 0.1% that believe that sodium fluoride... Well, pick whatever you want.
[00:57:48.689 --> 00:57:49.750]  Tell me the last time.
[00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:52.672]  Tell me the last time the econoclast turned out to be right.
[00:57:52.672 --> 00:57:54.954]  Because you're talking to an old-time hippie here.
[00:57:54.954 --> 00:57:56.936]  I'm a very anti-establishment guy.
[00:57:57.336 --> 00:58:00.821]  You know, I was into this stuff before most people listening to the program were born.
[00:58:14.859 --> 00:58:19.280]  In an appropriate amount, but Americans are often getting too much, so I agree with you there.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.121]  No, it can definitely be toxic.
[00:58:21.121 --> 00:58:21.921]  It's like everything else.
[00:58:21.921 --> 00:58:23.921]  You turn the heat on in your house, it warms your house.
[00:58:23.921 --> 00:58:24.722]  Too little, you freeze.
[00:58:24.722 --> 00:58:26.082]  Too much, you burn your house down.
[00:58:26.082 --> 00:58:26.842]  Yeah, in fact, I've done it.
[00:58:26.842 --> 00:58:29.323]  Like everything, fluoride is toxic in large amounts.
[00:58:29.323 --> 00:58:30.003]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:30.003 --> 00:58:30.443]  Gotta break.
[00:58:30.443 --> 00:58:31.063]  Final segment.
[00:58:31.063 --> 00:58:35.584]  Straight ahead.
[00:58:35.584 --> 00:58:39.305]  You are listening to GCN.
[00:58:39.305 --> 00:58:41.066]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[00:58:44.679 --> 00:58:46.099]  It is a big idea.
[00:58:46.099 --> 00:58:48.900]  A New World Order.
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:53.801]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:58:53.801 --> 00:58:56.641]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:58:56.641 --> 00:58:59.422]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:58:59.422 --> 00:59:02.602]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:59:02.602 --> 00:59:09.924]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:59:12.955 --> 00:59:18.400]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:22.284]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:59:22.284 --> 00:59:24.846]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:59:24.846 --> 00:59:26.027]  Most people have no idea.
[00:59:26.027 --> 00:59:26.788]  They're not after money.
[00:59:26.788 --> 00:59:28.069]  They have all the money they need.
[00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:29.070]  They're after power.
[00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:30.211]  That's what Apple needs here.

[00:59:41.698 --> 00:59:46.840]  You have been warned.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:49.242]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:49.242 --> 00:59:52.003]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:58.752 --> 01:00:00.513]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:00.513 --> 01:00:02.094]  You want answers?
[01:00:02.094 --> 01:00:03.655]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:03.655 --> 01:00:07.837]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:07.837 --> 01:00:14.220]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:16.281]  Well, he's agreed to come back in the future.
[01:00:16.281 --> 01:00:19.463]  We've just got five minutes left with him.
[01:00:19.463 --> 01:00:26.907]  Nationally syndicated radio talk show host, Dr. Dina Dell, in the top 15 or so talk shows in the country, most listened to.
[01:00:28.303 --> 01:00:33.670]  And, uh, he's with us for about four more minutes here, so I'm just gonna rapid-fire a few more comments at him.
[01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:35.713]  Uh, Dr. Dean, you know, I talked about Tuskegee.
[01:00:35.713 --> 01:00:38.437]  I talked about, uh, you know, eugenics.
[01:00:39.153 --> 01:00:40.673]  The other things that have happened.
[01:00:40.673 --> 01:00:52.956]  There's no doubt the UN, if you don't know this I can send it to you, has been caught adding different synthetic hormones to tetanus shots and sterilizing and Planned Parenthood's in trouble for, yeah, give us money to get rid of the black people.
[01:00:52.956 --> 01:00:54.616]  I mean, all this is going on.
[01:00:54.616 --> 01:01:05.579]  That's why a lot of people don't trust the medical system and, I mean, I'm sure you know, you're a medical doctor, Presidio University, that a lot of our modern sciences were dominated by eugenicists
[01:01:06.159 --> 01:01:15.147]  Up until, you know, 30-something states for sterilization here, and then they went underground with crypto-eugenics after World War II.
[01:01:15.147 --> 01:01:16.328]  Were you aware of that?
[01:01:16.328 --> 01:01:17.088]  Yeah, of course.
[01:01:17.088 --> 01:01:23.454]  But I kind of don't think it's helpful to take our past mistakes and condemn the future.
[01:01:23.454 --> 01:01:24.134]  I agree with you.
[01:01:24.134 --> 01:01:32.241]  These things have been horrible black marks on the history of science, like the horrible black... Listen, you can say America is a horrible, horrible country.
[01:01:32.682 --> 01:01:42.593]  Because of all the horrible things we did, and look at our mistakes, and go down all the bad things we've done internationally, and with other countries, and in war, and violence, and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, in our history.
[01:01:42.593 --> 01:01:44.695]  That doesn't mean we're not a great country.
[01:01:44.695 --> 01:01:48.580]  You know, so I think you've got to be very, very careful when you raise these issues.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.602]  In terms of throwing the baby out with the bathwater.
[01:01:51.602 --> 01:01:54.343]  But I'm not saying the whole country is bad.
[01:01:54.343 --> 01:02:03.469]  I'm saying these mad scientists, who literally, I mean, that guy Watson at the Human Genome Project at Cold Springs Harbor.
[01:02:03.469 --> 01:02:05.250]  He was there when it was eugenics.
[01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:06.271]  I read books.
[01:02:06.271 --> 01:02:09.212]  Oh no, he's got terrible racist views.
[01:02:09.212 --> 01:02:11.534]  It's all of them though, I'm telling you.
[01:02:11.534 --> 01:02:12.514]  Don't say all of them.
[01:02:12.514 --> 01:02:16.577]  Okay, 95% of the captains of modern... Well, 5% is not all.
[01:02:18.044 --> 01:02:19.625]  You said all.
[01:02:19.625 --> 01:02:22.226]  I'm saying the vast majority of the captains.
[01:02:22.226 --> 01:02:22.906]  Well, you know what?
[01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:30.289]  I mean, 50 years ago, almost everybody at the highest levels of science in this country, in England and Germany, was a raving racist.
[01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:31.109]  Everybody knows that.
[01:02:31.109 --> 01:02:33.170]  Well, I'd say 50 years ago, most people were.
[01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:36.042]  I grew up in America.
[01:02:36.042 --> 01:02:43.885]  I'm a child of World War II, and I would say we had and still have a problem with all this.
[01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:45.385]  But I'm saying it's like Autopilot.
[01:02:45.385 --> 01:02:46.426]  It's like Autopilot.
[01:02:46.426 --> 01:02:49.107]  Their ideas, their systems of bioethics.
[01:02:49.107 --> 01:02:55.229]  I mean, you've read the Wall Street Journal pieces about how people will be begging for food and water, and they assanguillate them.
[01:02:55.229 --> 01:02:57.190]  I'm not talking about Terry Schiavo.
[01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:58.711]  I mean, you know about those cases.
[01:02:58.711 --> 01:02:59.391]  Yeah, of course.
[01:02:59.391 --> 01:03:00.751]  But listen, I don't know.
[01:03:00.751 --> 01:03:02.092]  You tell me what you think.
[01:03:02.993 --> 01:03:06.539]  What profession do you think does not have really bad apples?
[01:03:06.539 --> 01:03:08.102]  I'm not your talk show host.
[01:03:08.102 --> 01:03:14.132]  Everything does, I agree with you, but what I'm asking you, last question is this, why have doctors stopped giving the Hippocratic Oath?
[01:03:15.505 --> 01:03:17.726]  Um, I don't know that they have, and I took it in medicine.
[01:03:17.726 --> 01:03:25.931]  The Hippocratic Oath was written 2,000 years ago, and if you read it, it talks about not taking money from slaves, and it's like totally, totally out of touch.
[01:03:25.931 --> 01:03:37.778]  We are a very highly screened group of professionals with bad apples, unethical, immoral people in it, but I'll bet you, if you took a survey of lawyers, politicians, businessmen... It says they have a higher rate.
[01:03:38.499 --> 01:03:39.779]  They would have a higher rate.
[01:03:39.779 --> 01:03:40.900]  And we're humans!
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:41.980]  We're humans, you know?
[01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:46.281]  So it's important for the public to be aware of this, so they can avoid this.
[01:03:46.281 --> 01:03:49.222]  Look, our medical practitioners are very professional.
[01:03:49.222 --> 01:03:51.342]  It's a very important priest guild.
[01:03:51.342 --> 01:03:52.802]  We all know what it is.
[01:03:52.802 --> 01:03:56.023]  With the little double snakes going up the tree and all the rest of it.
[01:03:56.023 --> 01:03:58.204]  And we worship our doctors.
[01:03:58.204 --> 01:03:58.924]  I understand that.
[01:03:59.484 --> 01:04:02.168]  No, wait a second, I don't understand that.
[01:04:02.168 --> 01:04:04.310]  We'll get off the pedestals and people will get off their knees.
[01:04:04.310 --> 01:04:05.532]  No need to worship us.
[01:04:05.532 --> 01:04:09.897]  I think it would be a lot healthier to not worship doctors, so I agree with you.
[01:04:09.897 --> 01:04:13.121]  Well, will you come back on sometime so we can have further debates?
[01:04:13.121 --> 01:04:14.143]  Anytime, this is fun.
[01:04:14.921 --> 01:04:17.383]  Well, you've written a lot of books.
[01:04:17.383 --> 01:04:18.624]  I've been trying to make you plug them.
[01:04:18.624 --> 01:04:19.965]  I mean, what's some of the books?
[01:04:19.965 --> 01:04:21.406]  Come on, plug them for us.
[01:04:21.406 --> 01:04:22.867]  I'm not a plugger.
[01:04:22.867 --> 01:04:24.908]  The first book is Eat, Drink, and Be Merry.
[01:04:24.908 --> 01:04:26.109]  I think that's a good one.
[01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:30.192]  And my most recent book is Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Healthiness.
[01:04:30.692 --> 01:04:32.113]  Dr. Dean, I've got your email.
[01:04:32.113 --> 01:04:34.913]  I'm gonna send you a bunch of stuff about what they're putting in the water.
[01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:44.577]  And if I send you proof that they're putting toxic waste in the water, will you... Uh, any information, I'm an information junkie, but beware, I will send you back information and I'll ask you about it the next time we're together.
[01:04:44.577 --> 01:04:46.537]  Alright, thanks for spending time with us.
[01:04:46.537 --> 01:04:46.797]  Alright.

[01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:07.995]  All right, we're going to be covering the economy for a full hour with Bob Chapman, and we're just going to take your calls in the third hour.
[01:08:11.610 --> 01:08:13.371]  We just had Dr. Dean Adele on.
[01:08:13.371 --> 01:08:15.252]  Very slick.
[01:08:15.252 --> 01:08:16.713]  He's gotten a lot more hardcore.
[01:08:16.713 --> 01:08:17.874]  I really used to enjoy his show.
[01:08:17.874 --> 01:08:18.914]  10, 12, 14.
[01:08:18.914 --> 01:08:19.534]  I don't know.
[01:08:19.534 --> 01:08:21.516]  I've probably been listening longer than that.
[01:08:21.516 --> 01:08:22.616]  I can't believe how old I am.
[01:08:22.616 --> 01:08:26.778]  I guess I was listening to Dr. Dean in high school.
[01:08:26.778 --> 01:08:27.739]  So that would be 17 years ago.
[01:08:27.739 --> 01:08:28.079]  Excuse me.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:37.866]  I always say dates, like we reported on this four years, I mean six, I mean eight, I just keep forgetting how old I've gotten.
[01:08:37.866 --> 01:08:53.498]  I'm supposedly not that old, but thirty-four, doing this since I was twenty-one, I am a old hand, ladies and gentlemen, but I've been listening to Dr. Dina Dell since I was about a junior in high school, right when we moved to Austin, Texas.
[01:08:53.498 --> 01:08:54.699]  I would hear him on KLBJ 590.
[01:08:56.693 --> 01:08:59.215]  And he is now just unbelievable.
[01:08:59.215 --> 01:09:02.839]  He gets on air and says, you know, there's no mercury in vaccines.
[01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:03.920]  He says it point-blank.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:10.726]  Well, I made him say, oh, well, it's actually not in the children's anymore.
[01:09:10.726 --> 01:09:11.647]  Wrong again, Doc.
[01:09:11.647 --> 01:09:14.770]  We're going to put a big story together, and we're going to show all that.
[01:09:14.770 --> 01:09:17.152]  But he said he'll come back on, and we'll debate it further.
[01:09:17.970 --> 01:09:21.614]  And I'm going to send him the documentation about all the fluoride used in the U.S.
[01:09:21.614 --> 01:09:25.117]  is from toxic waste, and they allow hundreds of other chemicals.
[01:09:25.117 --> 01:09:31.123]  I mean, I've had EPA sub-directors of entire poison divisions on.
[01:09:31.123 --> 01:09:37.889]  I mean, this is mainline, absolutely admitted, and Odell said he didn't know that.
[01:09:37.889 --> 01:09:44.095]  So, again, the problem is, you have people in the alternative media who are a bunch of kooks.
[01:09:44.631 --> 01:09:52.295]  You got liars, you got spinners, you got nuts, you got people with corporate agendas in the mainline media, and you got some good people there too.
[01:09:52.295 --> 01:09:59.659]  And then, folks then think that everybody in the alternative is perfect, and that we're all telling the truth, and then you get taken for a ride.
[01:09:59.659 --> 01:10:01.460]  And you need to stop doing that.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:03.141]  You need to not believe me.
[01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:06.542]  You need to go check out my claims, the things I say, the things I do.
[01:10:06.542 --> 01:10:11.265]  If I tell you Margaret Sanger was a eugenicist and said black people are weeds and that they had to exterminate them,
[01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:14.611]  I mean, I didn't just believe online journals.
[01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:16.432]  I actually went to the library.
[01:10:16.432 --> 01:10:22.295]  I sent my crew to the library here in Austin, and we actually had to write to... I forget the university.
[01:10:22.295 --> 01:10:30.339]  It's in Missouri, where her papers are, and I got the copies from the university of her calling black people subhuman.
[01:10:30.339 --> 01:10:31.339]  That was for Endgame.
[01:10:31.339 --> 01:10:34.581]  It's all... A lot of that didn't even get in the film.
[01:10:34.581 --> 01:10:35.481]  It went over two hours.
[01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:36.962]  We're making an Endgame 2, obviously.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:48.927]  That's gonna be just all about that, but the point is, is that we make a claim, it's documented, and that's why I love Jeffrey Smith, because I have forgotten so much I've learned.
[01:10:48.927 --> 01:10:57.131]  The Nobel Prize winners, the scientists, the experts, the people running divisions, the, you know, the internal studies that have been leaked, all of it.
[01:10:57.131 --> 01:11:05.196]  And when I get this guy on, it's like I remember everything he's talking about, and then more, and I'm Googling what he's saying as he's saying, and he is just, he's so accurate.
[01:11:06.226 --> 01:11:08.087]  And that's why he's the world best-selling author.
[01:11:08.087 --> 01:11:14.072]  He has the best-selling work on GMO foods, and that's Seeds of Deception.
[01:11:14.072 --> 01:11:17.795]  The latest book is Genetic Roulette, an unbelievable book.
[01:11:17.795 --> 01:11:19.956]  I mean, it's got lavish colored pages.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.862]  It's like a big textbook.
[01:11:23.862 --> 01:11:24.963]  This is textbook quality.
[01:11:24.963 --> 01:11:33.129]  If you were in college, you'd pay $100 for this book, and we have it for a lot like $27 or something.
[01:11:33.129 --> 01:11:42.896]  They also have a deal $19.95 for two DVD films and a huge CD, and then a bunch of extras.
[01:11:42.896 --> 01:11:44.877]  It's like a $50-something value.
[01:11:44.877 --> 01:11:47.979]  I'm just guessing what two films and a huge audio CD would be for $19.95.
[01:11:47.979 --> 01:11:48.680]  That's at Infowars.com.
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:54.003]  And, uh, I just want you to get it.
[01:11:54.003 --> 01:11:55.524]  I want you to get it.
[01:11:55.524 --> 01:11:57.967]  I want you to know what's happening.
[01:11:57.967 --> 01:12:04.453]  Now, today, for the next 50 minutes, we've got him, and I appreciate him, and I am going to try my best to just sit here and shut up.
[01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:12.661]  In the last two parts, we went through how they're, what's happening, what it's doing, how it's killing the rats, the guinea pigs, what it does to their livers, how it's already in our food.
[01:12:13.956 --> 01:12:22.141]  And then there's other facets we haven't gotten into about where this is going, what the future of GMO is, how to stop it.
[01:12:22.141 --> 01:12:22.922]  There's good news.
[01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:24.543]  People want solutions.
[01:12:24.543 --> 01:12:26.104]  We've got a lot of success stories.
[01:12:26.104 --> 01:12:29.006]  So whatever you want to get into, sir, you've got the floor.
[01:12:29.006 --> 01:12:31.307]  We're honored to have you with us again today.
[01:12:31.307 --> 01:12:32.588]  Well, thank you very much, Alex.
[01:12:32.588 --> 01:12:33.429]  And there is a lot.
[01:12:33.429 --> 01:12:36.631]  There's a lot to genetically modified foods because it's our food supply.
[01:12:36.631 --> 01:12:38.332]  It's our ecosystem.
[01:12:38.332 --> 01:12:40.053]  It's our structure of science and government.
[01:12:40.737 --> 01:12:46.081]  And it's all this huge, fiercely pitched battle going on all over the world.
[01:12:46.081 --> 01:12:55.048]  I want to first recommend to your listeners to do some e-activism by going to DontPlantGMObeats.org.
[01:12:55.048 --> 01:12:57.931]  DontPlantGMObeats.org.
[01:12:57.931 --> 01:13:09.260]  This was set up by the Interfaith Center that is involved with their coalition of faith-based
[01:13:12.085 --> 01:13:28.839]  And I talked to them and said that Monsanto's genetically modified sugar beets are about to be planted in the United States, which will turn our sugar supply into a genetically engineered sugar supply.
[01:13:28.839 --> 01:13:38.907]  And they immediately put up this website, don'tplantgmobeets.org, and if you send a single letter, it'll go to 63 different companies
[01:13:39.742 --> 01:13:44.706]  Asking them to please do not allow these GM sugar beets to be planted.
[01:13:44.706 --> 01:13:47.568]  We already have four major GM crops in the ground.
[01:13:47.568 --> 01:13:49.590]  Soy, corn, cotton, and canola.
[01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:52.072]  So they're in most processed foods.
[01:13:52.072 --> 01:13:55.534]  We eat them and there's a lot of evidence showing that they're highly unsafe.
[01:13:55.534 --> 01:14:01.138]  So this is one way that we can try and stop the sugar beets being added to those four.
[01:14:01.138 --> 01:14:08.204]  What I was thinking, Alex, to talk about is how scientists around the world over the last ten years
[01:14:08.809 --> 01:14:17.735]  ...have been silenced, threatened, forced out, denied tenure, pressured, when they have discovered problems with genetically engineered foods.
[01:14:17.735 --> 01:14:19.516]  Should we go there?
[01:14:19.516 --> 01:14:20.116]  Absolutely.
[01:14:20.116 --> 01:14:22.578]  I would just go back to you talking about religious groups.
[01:14:22.578 --> 01:14:35.666]  Just a caveat before we go forward, or an addendum to finish up, does it help that we just had the Pope with over a billion adherents, you know, the head of that religion, coming out and saying it's a sin to eat it?
[01:14:35.666 --> 01:14:38.128]  Yes, he said genetic manipulation.
[01:14:38.786 --> 01:14:39.986]  Is one of the new sins.
[01:14:39.986 --> 01:14:50.689]  Now, I know that many organizations, many religious groups believe that the word GMO, which stands for genetically modified organism, might as well stand for God move over.
[01:14:50.689 --> 01:15:03.773]  Because what they're doing is they're taking genes from one species, like for example, a spider gene is inserted into a goat in the hopes that they can milk the goat to get spider web protein to make bulletproof vests.
[01:15:03.773 --> 01:15:06.714]  Human genes are inserted into corn to make spermicide.
[01:15:07.546 --> 01:15:11.830]  Jellyfish genes are inserted into pigs so that their noses glow in the dark.
[01:15:11.830 --> 01:15:18.195]  And the foods that we eat have insecticide genes from bacteria inserted into the corn and cotton.
[01:15:18.195 --> 01:15:27.083]  So in every cell of the plant, in the case of corn, in every bite of the corn, we're eating an insecticide produced from a bacterial gene.
[01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:35.210]  Swapping genes between the normal natural barriers certainly carries ethical considerations, but it also carries scientific problems.
[01:15:35.956 --> 01:15:40.866]  The very process of inserting a gene causes massive collateral damage in the DNA.
[01:15:42.529 --> 01:15:50.235]  The end of the day, the DNA is 2-4% different than what it was before the gene was inserted and the cell was grown into cloning.
[01:15:50.235 --> 01:15:56.460]  That's the key that we didn't get to last time, and then get back into how they're trying to suppress scientists, because I think that's so important.
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:05.327]  There's so many facets of now remembering points I wanted to go back to, that this can alter our DNA, and that's what your books and videos get into that we haven't covered.
[01:16:05.327 --> 01:16:06.548]  Can we get into that now?
[01:16:06.548 --> 01:16:07.709]  Absolutely.
[01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:11.973]  Now, there's a number of ways in which genetic engineering could alter our DNA.
[01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:15.058]  When we eat the food.
[01:16:15.058 --> 01:16:41.852]  Originally, the FDA scientists, and we know this because documents made public from a lawsuit, they were concerned about the antibiotic-resistant marker gene, which is used in most GM crops, transferring from the food we eat into bacterial genes inside of us, which if it was pathogenic bacteria, if it was equipped with this antibiotic-resistant gene, it could turn into a super disease, untreatable with antibiotics.
[01:16:43.086 --> 01:16:57.857]  The secret documents from the FDA scientist, an entire division, wrote in all capital letters in their summary, it would be a serious health hazard to introduce a gene that codes for antibiotic resistance into the intestinal flora of the general population.
[01:16:57.857 --> 01:16:59.779]  They were ignored.
[01:16:59.779 --> 01:17:04.102]  They were basically told, don't worry, genes are destroyed during digestion.
[01:17:04.102 --> 01:17:10.947]  We also know now that genes are not destroyed during digestion, but they can also transfer into our cells.
[01:17:10.947 --> 01:17:11.988]  They took mice,
[01:17:12.577 --> 01:17:13.718]  And they fed them DNA.
[01:17:13.718 --> 01:17:16.880]  This was normal DNA, not genetically modified.
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:26.848]  And they fed it to pregnant mice, and they found that in the brains of the offspring were fragments of the DNA from the mother's food.
[01:17:26.848 --> 01:17:33.072]  They fed genetically engineered feed to pigs and found the genes in all sorts of their organs.
[01:17:33.072 --> 01:17:41.058]  So if we eat genetically engineered crops, we might end up with the genes not only in our gut bacteria, but in our cells.
[01:17:41.368 --> 01:17:46.613]  Possibly integrating into the DNA and influencing ourselves.
[01:17:46.613 --> 01:17:56.361]  Now there's only been one human feeding study ever conducted and that showed and it proved that genes do end up in the DNA of our gut bacteria.
[01:17:56.361 --> 01:18:02.947]  So that long after we stop eating GMOs we might still have these foreign proteins produced continuously inside us.
[01:18:02.947 --> 01:18:07.551]  Foreign proteins like a pesticide or an antibiotic resistant gene.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:21.326]  And it's important to add that it's thousands of times the normal level of the natural fungus pesticide, and it's within the genetics of the body now.
[01:18:21.326 --> 01:18:24.248]  It's within the genetics of the plant that you then eat.
[01:18:24.248 --> 01:18:24.888]  Exactly.
[01:18:24.888 --> 01:18:27.650]  Because they'll argue, oh, that's a naturally occurring thing.
[01:18:27.650 --> 01:18:32.432]  Yeah, but they've now souped up a thousand times and stuck inside the DNA.
[01:18:32.432 --> 01:18:33.273]  Precisely.
[01:18:33.273 --> 01:18:34.133]  Precisely.
[01:18:34.133 --> 01:18:37.875]  When they stick the gene into these crops, let's get a little bit scientific here.
[01:18:38.652 --> 01:18:40.953]  They put in an on switch called a promoter.
[01:18:40.953 --> 01:18:43.894]  They take it from a virus, and it's a very aggressive on switch.
[01:18:43.894 --> 01:18:51.537]  It turns on the gene 24-7 around the clock without stopping to pump out high volumes of this foreign protein.
[01:18:51.537 --> 01:19:01.641]  Now, one of the many assumptions of the scientists that was proved wrong was that this on switch would only turn on this foreign gene and no other genes.
[01:19:01.641 --> 01:19:06.543]  But it now is known that when you insert a promoter with a gene into a cell,
[01:19:07.159 --> 01:19:13.605]  It could also turn on other genes permanently at high volume in that cell.
[01:19:13.605 --> 01:19:25.354]  So it could, it's like throwing a dart into the genome and say, turn on something at random so it overproduces an allergen or a toxin or a carcinogen or an antinutrient.
[01:19:25.354 --> 01:19:31.500]  And so that happens in the crops and it might also happen within our own bacteria or our own cells.
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:35.263]  Okay, I want to come back into how they're suppressing the scientists, the documents of that.
[01:19:36.647 --> 01:19:42.758]  And then Dr. Dida Dell comes on and says everything's fine, everything's wonderful, but we've got to stop is the vitamin people.
[01:19:42.758 --> 01:19:43.820]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:19:51.718 --> 01:20:04.866]  Now from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history, comes the long-awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two-hour film that completely destroys the official fable forever.
[01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:08.688]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[01:20:09.048 --> 01:20:15.912]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.

[01:21:54.375 --> 01:21:56.136]  A New World Order.
[01:21:56.136 --> 01:22:01.037]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:22:01.037 --> 01:22:03.858]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:22:03.858 --> 01:22:06.659]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:22:06.659 --> 01:22:09.820]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:22:09.820 --> 01:22:17.142]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:25.632]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:22:25.632 --> 01:22:29.494]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:22:29.494 --> 01:22:32.056]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:22:32.056 --> 01:22:33.237]  Most people have no idea.
[01:22:33.237 --> 01:22:34.017]  They're not after money.
[01:22:34.017 --> 01:22:35.298]  They have all the money they need.
[01:22:35.298 --> 01:22:36.279]  They're after power.
[01:22:36.279 --> 01:22:37.420]  That's what happens here.

[01:22:46.906 --> 01:22:48.947]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:22:48.947 --> 01:22:50.008]  You have been warned.
[01:22:51.149 --> 01:22:54.433]  The Road Warrior radio broadcast bringing you the quickening.

[01:24:10.183 --> 01:24:13.185]  Alright, fast segment, gotta move fast with our guests.
[01:24:13.185 --> 01:24:14.965]  Remember, you're eating this.
[01:24:14.965 --> 01:24:22.249]  The main seven food crops, the wheat, the corn, all of it, a lot of it's GMO now.
[01:24:22.249 --> 01:24:23.810]  A large portion is.
[01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:29.733]  It's invading the other stocks of corn and wheat and the rest of it.
[01:24:29.733 --> 01:24:32.454]  That is, it's taking over their seeds, it's taking over their genetics.
[01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:36.491]  And now they want to bring in beets, all the rest of it.
[01:24:36.491 --> 01:24:38.531]  Hundreds of different plants being developed for this.
[01:24:38.531 --> 01:24:39.991]  And we're just talking about what's currently going on.
[01:24:39.991 --> 01:24:41.972]  I want to get into some of the more advanced stuff.
[01:24:41.972 --> 01:24:45.972]  The chimeras, the spider goats, the rest of it.
[01:24:45.972 --> 01:24:54.094]  Coming up, but please continue with the different scientists and people a lot of times in these companies who are getting paid.
[01:24:54.094 --> 01:24:58.015]  They don't want to lose their job, but they do if they don't shut up.
[01:24:58.015 --> 01:25:02.116]  It's an interesting, well they've got a little world tour about
[01:25:03.072 --> 01:25:07.595]  People who have tried to even make critical statements about GMOs.
[01:25:07.595 --> 01:25:09.916]  Let's start with one that happened recently.
[01:25:09.916 --> 01:25:12.177]  Christian Velo from France.
[01:25:12.177 --> 01:25:22.583]  He's a molecular biologist, and he happened to set up some conferences so that they can discuss the risks and uncertainties of genetically modified foods.
[01:25:22.583 --> 01:25:26.265]  And when he came back to work, his research funds for this year were confiscated.
[01:25:26.265 --> 01:25:29.287]  Student assistants were redirected to other units.
[01:25:29.287 --> 01:25:32.249]  He was told that his research team was no longer to be part of the Institute.
[01:25:32.717 --> 01:25:36.839]  And that he would be kicked out, essentially, and asked to leave the premises.
[01:25:36.839 --> 01:25:44.662]  And this was just for raising concerns in a public forum, which is what science should be doing.
[01:25:44.662 --> 01:25:46.563]  Let's give another example.
[01:25:46.563 --> 01:25:47.903]  Irina Ermakova.
[01:25:47.903 --> 01:25:52.525]  I interviewed her at the EU Parliament after we gave a presentation there.
[01:25:52.525 --> 01:25:59.968]  She had documents, she had a piece of paper, she came back to her office one day and a piece of paper was burnt on her desk, kind of as a warning.
[01:25:59.968 --> 01:26:01.749]  Some of her samples had been stolen.
[01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:08.656]  She was told by her director to no longer do research on genetically engineered foods.
[01:26:08.656 --> 01:26:20.627]  She was attacked viciously in a published peer-reviewed journal that had lied to her, telling her that she was going to be authoring an article about her research, and it turns out they just wanted to set her up.
[01:26:20.627 --> 01:26:22.088]  So what was her crime?
[01:26:22.088 --> 01:26:27.053]  Well, her crime was discovering that rats that were fed genetically engineered soybeans
[01:26:27.823 --> 01:26:37.691]  That the offspring died at more than 50% compared to the offspring of rats that were fed regular soy and only died at about 10%.
[01:26:37.691 --> 01:26:44.956]  She also found that the size of the offspring when the mothers were fed GM soy was much smaller and they couldn't reproduce.
[01:26:44.956 --> 01:26:54.343]  So her crime was simply feeding rats genetically engineered soy that we eat every day and discovering death and problems in the offspring.
[01:26:54.343 --> 01:26:55.904]  Here's another one, Andrew Sterling.
[01:26:56.636 --> 01:27:11.709]  Andrew was part of this GM Nation debate in the UK, which was supposedly an even-handed look at genetic engineering over the whole course of an entire year by the UK citizens.
[01:27:11.709 --> 01:27:25.460]  But it wasn't even-handed at all, because he was one of the scientists invited to debate it, and it turned out that an official government website revealed that an unnamed individual in a privileged academic or regulatory position
[01:27:26.013 --> 01:27:33.497]  "...tried to get Andrew Sterling dropped from a research project by approaching its funders and disparaging his work and professional standing."
[01:27:33.497 --> 01:27:44.664]  In other words, he voiced doubts over the safety of genetically modified foods and was the target of a campaign to sabotage his career and funding.
[01:27:44.664 --> 01:27:47.205]  There's another one, Ignacio Ciappella.
[01:27:47.205 --> 01:27:51.888]  He accidentally discovered, he and his graduate student, he's a UC Berkeley professor,
[01:27:52.358 --> 01:28:01.060]  He accidentally discovered that the genetically modified corn had contaminated the indigenous corn varieties in Mexico.
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:08.622]  Well, he was threatened by a senior Mexican government official who implied, we know where your children go to school, trying to get them not to publish.
[01:28:08.622 --> 01:28:19.564]  He published anyway, and immediately afterwards, there was a smear campaign set up on a major scientific website by two people, Mary Murphy and Andreas Smedechek.
[01:28:20.086 --> 01:28:32.337]  Who's claimed that he was funded by Greenpeace, that he was an activist, and they riled up this group of scientists to try and call for a retraction of the paper in Nature, the journal Nature.
[01:28:32.337 --> 01:28:44.308]  Well, it turns out Mary Murphy, if you look at her, at the email properties, as one Jonathan Matthews did in the UK, he traced it back and it actually came from Monsanto.
[01:28:45.237 --> 01:28:56.166]  And if you look at Anduras Smedicek and her email properties and trace it back, it turns out it comes from the Bivings Group, which is a public relations firm for Monsanto.
[01:28:56.166 --> 01:29:13.680]  Mary Murphy and Anduras Smedicek are fictional human beings, apparently, who have been drummed up by Monsanto and or its public relations firm in an effort to attack this Ignacio Chappella, who was then denied tenure and attacked severely in his
[01:29:14.153 --> 01:29:16.955]  University of California at Berkeley.
[01:29:16.955 --> 01:29:24.279]  He mounted a campaign, filed a lawsuit, and only after two years of fighting was he finally given tenure.
[01:29:24.279 --> 01:29:26.300]  We'll be right back with our guests.
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:36.325]  Ladies and gentlemen, you can get the GMO trilogy, two DVD films made and put together by Jeffrey Smith and a huge audio CD.
[01:29:36.325 --> 01:29:37.506]  This affects all of us.
[01:29:37.506 --> 01:29:39.027]  It's one of the biggest issues out there.
[01:29:39.027 --> 01:29:41.088]  Get it at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:45.803]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:45.803 --> 01:29:48.485]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:52.714 --> 01:30:01.639]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[01:30:01.639 --> 01:30:06.682]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[01:30:06.682 --> 01:30:17.809]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[01:30:18.109 --> 01:30:23.871]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:23.871 --> 01:30:30.153]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:30.153 --> 01:30:31.073]  What about you?
[01:30:31.073 --> 01:30:32.994]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally.
[01:30:32.994 --> 01:30:37.295]  $49 for a special price of only $39.99 with free shipping.
[01:30:37.295 --> 01:30:39.016]  Call Jeff and order now by calling 562-544-0507.
[01:30:39.016 --> 01:30:39.616]  That's Jeff at 562-544-0507.
[01:30:46.758 --> 01:30:47.040]  We're good.
[01:30:51.641 --> 01:30:56.163]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[01:30:56.163 --> 01:31:01.265]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:01.265 --> 01:31:02.766]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:31:02.766 --> 01:31:06.368]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with CalBin Pure Soaps?
[01:31:06.368 --> 01:31:11.790]  They're all natural and you'll save some 85% the money you're spending for your cleaning products now.
[01:31:11.790 --> 01:31:17.573]  Marty Schachter founded CalBin Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[01:31:17.893 --> 01:31:20.414]  Now, Calvin Soaps are available to you and me.
[01:31:20.414 --> 01:31:22.934]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs.

[01:31:26.555 --> 01:31:27.736]  No animal testing.
[01:31:27.736 --> 01:31:29.076]  I use them and love them.
[01:31:29.076 --> 01:31:30.977]  Knowing they're all natural and safe.
[01:31:30.977 --> 01:31:32.377]  And I say big time.
[01:31:32.377 --> 01:31:33.837]  Call Calvin Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:31:36.598 --> 01:31:39.621]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[01:31:39.621 --> 01:31:43.506]  Again, that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[01:31:52.307 --> 01:31:54.288]  Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention.
[01:31:54.288 --> 01:31:55.788]  Ron Paul did not quit.
[01:31:55.788 --> 01:31:57.148]  He is still in the race.
[01:31:57.148 --> 01:32:00.869]  Most Americans do not understand how the election process works.
[01:32:00.869 --> 01:32:02.370]  The media is lying.
[01:32:02.370 --> 01:32:05.310]  John McCain does not have the Republican nomination.
[01:32:05.310 --> 01:32:08.431]  The popular vote is just a straw poll, believe it or not.
[01:32:08.431 --> 01:32:11.612]  The delegates have the power over the elections, not the voters.
[01:32:12.032 --> 01:32:16.974]  After the mainstream media wrote a hit piece on how Ron Paul quit, many supporters quit as well.
[01:32:16.974 --> 01:32:22.336]  Ron Paul has stated he will continue his run for presidency, as long as he has your continued support.
[01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:23.657]  Ron Paul has a plan.
[01:32:23.657 --> 01:32:30.400]  The delegates have not yet been voted on, and they are voted first in county, then state, all the way to the National Convention.
[01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:34.862]  Go to our website at RonPaulFlags.com and click on Why Ron Paul Will Win.
[01:32:35.382 --> 01:32:39.284]  That's Rompalflags.com to find out more on how delegates work.
[01:32:39.284 --> 01:32:40.144]  Stand your ground.
[01:32:40.144 --> 01:32:44.126]  Go for the win and fly a Rompalflag today or call 731-664-1526 for more information.
[01:32:44.126 --> 01:32:44.406]  That's 731-664-1526.
[01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:10.032]  Moving fast today with Jeffrey Smith.
[01:33:10.032 --> 01:33:14.436]  He is one of the leading experts in his books and films.
[01:33:14.436 --> 01:33:19.359]  He interviews more than 30 top scientists on what's happening with GMO.
[01:33:19.359 --> 01:33:22.021]  He goes off the source documentation.
[01:33:22.021 --> 01:33:26.425]  He is the global number one bestseller and the number one GMO book.
[01:33:26.425 --> 01:33:30.307]  There's quite a few of them out there and again, they're just both incredible.
[01:33:30.307 --> 01:33:32.269]  Because I care about my children, I care about myself.
[01:33:33.317 --> 01:33:39.021]  They study rats because they're very similar to humans in their whole metabolic system.
[01:33:39.021 --> 01:33:42.263]  That's their favorite, is of course the white lab rat.
[01:33:42.263 --> 01:33:46.446]  And there's other things they study on dogs, cats, but folks get real mad about that and I understand why.
[01:33:46.446 --> 01:33:48.027]  They also do it on guinea pigs, rabbits.
[01:33:48.027 --> 01:33:53.370]  And they're all pretty, pigs are very similar to our whole metabolic system.
[01:33:53.370 --> 01:33:59.474]  And when it's killing most of them, and killing the babies, and we're eating this, I mean we might want to have a concern here.
[01:34:01.392 --> 01:34:09.497]  Uh, and there's all these new illnesses, all these new diseases, all this crazy stuff happening to healthy people, all this new juvenile onset of diabetes, cancer.
[01:34:09.497 --> 01:34:12.519]  I mean, you go to the numbers, it's just staggering.
[01:34:12.519 --> 01:34:19.983]  Uh, life expectancy is actually dropping, even though they're boosting infant mortality, which is normally the number, you know, the thing that'll drop down a number.
[01:34:19.983 --> 01:34:24.166]  No, that's basically the same, but it's still dropping.
[01:34:24.166 --> 01:34:29.849]  We got a big problem, and we're gonna go back to him here in, uh, just one moment.
[01:34:30.966 --> 01:34:37.469]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about the Freedom Law School.
[01:34:37.469 --> 01:34:38.890]  They're just great folks.
[01:34:38.890 --> 01:34:50.895]  They put on some of the best conferences out there, bar none, and they're coming to Irvine, California, March 28th to the 31st, and a lot of these things sell out, so you might want to get your tickets now.
[01:34:50.895 --> 01:34:56.217]  William Arrigas, Jason Burmish, J. Edward Griffin, Tommy Cryer, Joe Bannister, Larry Becraft, Michael Collins Piper,
[01:34:56.772 --> 01:34:58.413]  Davon Kleiss and many, many others.
[01:34:58.413 --> 01:35:00.873]  You'll learn about just a whole host of issues.
[01:35:00.873 --> 01:35:02.474]  Very professional conferences.
[01:35:02.474 --> 01:35:04.795]  Learn more about it at LiveFreeNow.org.
[01:35:04.795 --> 01:35:05.755]  LiveFreeNow.org or 760-868-4271.
[01:35:05.755 --> 01:35:05.975]  That's 760-868-4271.
[01:35:05.975 --> 01:35:08.996]  And of course, my friends, you can also again visit LiveFreeNow.org.
[01:35:08.996 --> 01:35:11.077]  Okay, going back to our guest, Jeffrey Smith.
[01:35:25.908 --> 01:35:31.851]  Jeffrey, you were going through a litany of scientists, doctors, researchers being told to shut up.
[01:35:31.851 --> 01:35:41.555]  We've interviewed quite a few of them, and again, these are people, in some cases, who are making millions of dollars a year, they're part of the companies, or they're doing government studies, and they go, man, the rats are all dying.
[01:35:41.555 --> 01:35:43.976]  And then they're told, shut up!
[01:35:43.976 --> 01:35:46.417]  Or, you better watch it for your family.
[01:35:46.417 --> 01:35:54.161]  And now we have all these GMO foods that have had to be pulled from the market because they have such obvious and immediate effects on people getting real sick.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:55.841]  But they don't care.
[01:35:55.841 --> 01:35:57.002]  They just move forward.
[01:35:57.002 --> 01:35:59.665]  I guess they just... They're at the point of no return.
[01:35:59.665 --> 01:36:00.526]  It's their whole industry.
[01:36:00.526 --> 01:36:04.591]  Why not just keep going?
[01:36:04.591 --> 01:36:15.824]  In fact, there's such a vulnerable position right now that if a single study that was done properly and was repeatable showed that genetically modified foods were safe or unsafe,
[01:36:16.417 --> 01:36:20.158]  That they would cost them billions of dollars because they would lose their whole market.
[01:36:20.158 --> 01:36:23.839]  It would cost the food industry billions because the food industry uses it.
[01:36:23.839 --> 01:36:30.581]  So anyone that dares to do even independent studies is attacked even before they can do the study.
[01:36:30.581 --> 01:36:33.021]  This is a case of Judy Carman.
[01:36:33.021 --> 01:36:43.264]  She was actually given money by the Western Australian government to do the first, and I say this again, the first long-term animal feeding studies on the GM foods that we're already eating.
[01:36:43.997 --> 01:36:46.599]  And the biotech industry freaked out.
[01:36:46.599 --> 01:36:53.785]  They were sending letters to the Minister of Agriculture, who I met recently in Australia, saying, she shouldn't be allowed to do studies.
[01:36:53.785 --> 01:36:57.188]  We have plenty of studies on GMOs and it already proved it's safe.
[01:36:57.188 --> 01:36:58.990]  Stop this research.
[01:36:58.990 --> 01:37:08.357]  And they even sent a list of 61 abstracts, which is an incredibly small amount, saying, see all these studies that prove that GMOs are safe.
[01:37:08.357 --> 01:37:10.039]  Well, Judy Carman evaluated
[01:37:10.838 --> 01:37:15.482]  It turns out most were commercial studies that had nothing to do with food safety.
[01:37:15.482 --> 01:37:20.867]  She said only nine of them actually had to do with food safety, and six of them showed adverse reactions.
[01:37:20.867 --> 01:37:23.189]  And they left out a lot of other studies.
[01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:27.653]  But Judy Carmen was attacked mercilessly in the press.
[01:37:27.653 --> 01:37:30.115]  Someone said, well, where are you going to do your study?
[01:37:30.115 --> 01:37:31.956]  She doesn't even have a laboratory.
[01:37:31.956 --> 01:37:37.141]  So she responded saying, I happen to be a professor at the University of Adelaide.
[01:37:37.594 --> 01:37:44.817]  And the next thing you know, she lost the ability to access, apparently, her laboratory at the University of Adelaide.
[01:37:44.817 --> 01:37:46.798]  They attacked that link, too.
[01:37:46.798 --> 01:37:48.278]  They're merciless.
[01:37:48.278 --> 01:37:54.961]  Now, I was in Malaysia in 2004 at the Cardiator Protocol Conference on Biosafety, a U.N.
[01:37:54.961 --> 01:38:04.505]  conference on GMOs, and there, a very renowned virologist, Dr. Turjatovic, from Norway, reported some startling results.
[01:38:04.505 --> 01:38:06.706]  He found, for example, that an entire
[01:38:07.403 --> 01:38:16.728]  A community in the Philippines fell sick when genetically modified pesticide-producing corn started to pollinate next door.
[01:38:16.728 --> 01:38:21.171]  And the people got sick starting those living next to the field and then it moved for those further away.
[01:38:21.171 --> 01:38:30.155]  He did an antibody study and found out that there was an antibody reaction to this Bt toxin that was produced by the corn.
[01:38:30.155 --> 01:38:32.937]  And he announced his research there.
[01:38:33.399 --> 01:38:34.820]  And he was viciously attacked.
[01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:38.642]  It hadn't yet been published, but this was, in fact, a scientific conference.
[01:38:38.642 --> 01:38:58.992]  He was viciously attacked, and I actually wrote it up and made it available on his behalf for the papers, and, you know, people were calling me, and it was just, it was an example where, as soon as it was reported, he came under attack for no scientific reason, but has not been able to raise money since then to do a follow-up and to actually get it published.
[01:39:00.351 --> 01:39:00.931]  This goes on.
[01:39:00.931 --> 01:39:02.552]  I mean, I could continue to talk about this.
[01:39:02.552 --> 01:39:08.998]  Well, we are, but let me just pause here for a moment so listeners realize what we're talking about here.
[01:39:08.998 --> 01:39:23.670]  Suddenly, in every major town I talk to people, everybody's sick, everybody has allergies now, they're having trouble breathing, and there's no doubt a lot of this is the GMO because we have this case point test he did.
[01:39:23.670 --> 01:39:25.872]  In the case of Malaysia, we know what it's doing.
[01:39:26.718 --> 01:39:31.000]  And again, the people that are defending this, it's just mindless.
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:32.720]  It's affecting them too.
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:33.060]  I know.
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:55.869]  I was speaking just over the weekend to the Pan American Allergy Society, to a room full of allergists, and I pointed out to them how eating genetically engineered foods might not only cause allergic reactions to those foods, for example, soon after GM soy was introduced to the UK, soy allergy skyrocketed there, but
[01:39:56.463 --> 01:40:00.804]  It might also lead to allergies to other foods.
[01:40:00.804 --> 01:40:02.845]  And here's why.
[01:40:02.845 --> 01:40:12.107]  Mice that were fed genetically engineered soy had reductions in the production of enzymes in their pancreas that normally break down food.
[01:40:12.107 --> 01:40:20.670]  If it takes a longer time for proteins to break down, that means there's a longer period of time to cause allergic reactions.
[01:40:20.670 --> 01:40:24.791]  And, by the way, the scientist, of course, that did this research also was
[01:40:25.327 --> 01:40:28.949]  Denied funding for some of her additional research.
[01:40:28.949 --> 01:40:38.073]  So it shows that eating genetically modified soy might increase allergic reactions to a wide variety of other products.
[01:40:38.073 --> 01:40:45.717]  In fact, just after GM soy was introduced in 1996, over the next five years, peanut allergies doubled.
[01:40:45.717 --> 01:40:50.759]  Now we know that there is a cross-reactivity between soybeans and peanuts.
[01:40:50.759 --> 01:40:53.080]  A small percentage of people who are allergic to peanuts
[01:40:53.482 --> 01:40:56.865]  Well, I've developed pretty bad allergies and my grandmother, who's lived in Austin her whole life,
[01:41:11.696 --> 01:41:11.796]  Yes.
[01:41:31.125 --> 01:41:45.750]  Less and less discriminatory, and then there's, or more and more discriminatory, and then there's also studies showing that that is what kind of burns out your immune system, is that hyperactivity, and then finally it breaks down and gives in, and a lot of that's tied to cancer.
[01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:55.393]  And a lot of, basically almost every study that's been done on the immune response to genetically modified crops among animals has shown some kind of immune response.
[01:41:55.393 --> 01:42:00.355]  When they fed mice this BT toxin, which is engineered to be produced in this corn and cotton,
[01:42:00.885 --> 01:42:08.608]  The mice not only developed an immune response as powerful as if they had been fed cholera toxin, but they developed like a multiple chemical sensitivity.
[01:42:08.608 --> 01:42:12.389]  They were sensitive to other formerly harmless compounds.
[01:42:12.389 --> 01:42:20.532]  Similarly, mice in Australia that were fed a genetically modified pea all of a sudden became reactive to egg albumin and other products.
[01:42:20.532 --> 01:42:27.534]  So, we're talking about a way in which these foreign genetically modified crops, mainly soy, corn, cotton, and canola,
[01:42:28.081 --> 01:42:34.847]  Might be responsible for causing this huge increase in food allergies, particularly among children.
[01:42:34.847 --> 01:42:38.271]  Now, you have them looking at you with a huge magnifying glass.
[01:42:38.271 --> 01:42:40.012]  You keep saying, might, might, might.
[01:42:40.012 --> 01:42:42.174]  But then you can list study after study.
[01:42:42.174 --> 01:42:44.036]  It's just a legal thing, really.
[01:42:44.036 --> 01:42:46.098]  I mean, I have to be careful what I say.
[01:42:46.098 --> 01:42:50.202]  I mean, they're trying to get after me all the time.
[01:42:50.202 --> 01:42:52.664]  There was a profile in me in Reuters last week.
[01:42:53.223 --> 01:43:05.433]  Where it described that I was traveling all around the world and presenting evidence of thousands of sick, sterile, and dead livestock, thousands of toxic and allergic reactions in humans, and damaged virtually every organ and system studied.
[01:43:05.433 --> 01:43:15.882]  And, of course, they had to balance the report by a pro-GM, mindless person who said, Jeffrey Smith is articulate and strong in his personal beliefs, but he has no scientific background at all.
[01:43:15.882 --> 01:43:19.405]  Well, he just ignored the fact that my book has been reviewed by
[01:43:19.855 --> 01:43:27.740]  Every single page by at least three scientists, that there's 1,200 endnotes, and that I worked with more than 30 scientists to produce it, but none the matter.
[01:43:27.740 --> 01:43:31.062]  Well, Genetic Roulette is a textbook.
[01:43:31.062 --> 01:43:34.704]  Yes, in fact, it's kind of a combination of a textbook and a brochure.
[01:43:34.704 --> 01:43:40.128]  And that's because I had to deal with the attention deficit politician and the scientific staff.
[01:43:40.128 --> 01:43:48.293]  So I took out every two-page spread as an executive summary on the left side for someone to quickly read the whole book in just an hour.
[01:43:48.743 --> 01:43:48.803]  I'm
[01:44:06.577 --> 01:44:11.761]  It's probably the prettiest and most well-put-together book we sell on the online store.
[01:44:11.761 --> 01:44:19.166]  Now, I want to take a few calls, and I want to cover other facets, and I appreciate you coming back every few weeks to discontinue our education.
[01:44:19.166 --> 01:44:19.906]  Sure.
[01:44:19.906 --> 01:44:34.997]  But the more frankenfood-type stuff, I mean, I remember eight, nine years ago getting on air, reading CBS News, AP, Reuters, having the CEO in upstate New York of one of the spider goat facilities where they have the Army guarding it.
[01:44:36.701 --> 01:44:37.161]  We're good to go.
[01:44:51.912 --> 01:44:52.332]  I don't know.
[01:45:13.347 --> 01:45:28.394]  Uh, they, for years, have been just randomly splicing, so this has even gotten down to a boutique level, uh, where this is all going on, and the scientists are saying that can give rise to super viruses, bacteria, cross, I mean, this is, I mean, just, just, just,
[01:45:29.174 --> 01:45:41.058]  Creating the polio vaccine culture in monkey kidneys, you know, gave millions of people, that's how they admitted cancer, and hundreds of millions the SV40 cancer virus.
[01:45:41.058 --> 01:45:44.920]  And that's a 60-year-old, 50-year-old crisis.
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:46.220]  What about now?
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:49.461]  Just all the insane stuff that's going on.
[01:45:49.461 --> 01:45:56.524]  Well, yeah, right now we have the ability to mix and match genes from various species and put them together.
[01:45:57.065 --> 01:45:58.606]  And we're really babes in the woods there.
[01:45:58.606 --> 01:46:03.809]  I mean, every single few months, we completely redefine what DNA is all about.
[01:46:03.809 --> 01:46:16.476]  There was a study that came out where they took two strands of DNA and they put it into a completely clean solution and they were able to match up with their partners without transferring proteins or molecules between them.
[01:46:16.476 --> 01:46:23.620]  So they realized, my God, there's some way that these DNA strands recognize each other
[01:46:24.341 --> 01:46:30.787]  As like a field effect, just from knowing, just from being within the presence of similar strands.
[01:46:30.787 --> 01:46:33.609]  They're transmitting, as there's one more and more scientists think.
[01:46:33.609 --> 01:46:37.753]  And it turns out, you know, I was approaching a scientist years ago.
[01:46:37.753 --> 01:46:42.777]  I happened to have lunch with a Monsanto scientist who did supposed safety studies.
[01:46:42.777 --> 01:46:51.505]  And I said, well, you know, you're blasting these genes with a gene gun into the DNA, causing damage to the sequences where it hits.
[01:46:52.455 --> 01:46:55.357]  Well, what if it hits a part of a sequence where it's a problem?
[01:46:55.357 --> 01:46:59.200]  And he says, well, we're learning more and more about which sequences are important.
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:00.941]  I said, well, that's good.
[01:47:00.941 --> 01:47:04.284]  But then I said, what if all of the sequences in the DNA were important?
[01:47:04.284 --> 01:47:10.789]  What if they were quantum mechanical or field effects within the DNA that we don't even understand?
[01:47:10.789 --> 01:47:17.554]  And you're blasting new genetic material with a gun in there, sometimes deleting several genes and rearranging genes.
[01:47:18.180 --> 01:47:21.263]  And he didn't answer, he just continued to eat.
[01:47:21.263 --> 01:47:40.699]  Well we also know that there are a lot of ancient diseases and things that life forms have beaten that the code of that through their immunity is locked up and so you literally have thousands if not hundreds of thousands of different diseases, different pathogens that are locked up in that coding.
[01:47:40.699 --> 01:47:42.721]  Ah, here's where, this is a very good question Alex.
[01:47:43.399 --> 01:47:51.184]  Now, we talked earlier about the promoter, the on-switch, which can randomly turn on genes full bore, 24-7, around the clock.
[01:47:51.184 --> 01:47:58.369]  There are ancient viruses embedded inside the DNA of human beings and other higher organisms.
[01:47:58.369 --> 01:48:03.893]  Most of them are degraded, but some may be fully intact, but lack their on-switch.
[01:48:03.893 --> 01:48:11.879]  What happens if this promoter, this gene, the transgene that gets inserted, lies end up near one of these old viruses?
[01:48:12.304 --> 01:48:14.424]  And what if that on-switch turns it on?
[01:48:14.424 --> 01:48:23.606]  We could be flipping on viruses that haven't been in this Earth for centuries or millennia because of this random nature of the infection.
[01:48:23.606 --> 01:48:30.287]  Well, that's what all the top scientists I have on say, and then I simplify it and say, folks, all this engineering could give rise to superviruses.
[01:48:30.287 --> 01:48:31.867]  You know, that's shorthand.
[01:48:31.867 --> 01:48:33.248]  I'm not just saying that.
[01:48:33.248 --> 01:48:41.629]  And there's another way that it can cause other viruses also, and that is in papaya, zucchini, and crookneck squash, the three minor GM ingredients.
[01:48:42.170 --> 01:48:46.612]  They're engineered not, you know, basically to resist a certain virus.
[01:48:46.612 --> 01:48:52.455]  And what they do is they put viral genes into the DNA of this papaya, zucchini, and crookneck squash.
[01:48:52.455 --> 01:48:55.097]  And we know viruses mix so they can mutate together.
[01:48:55.097 --> 01:48:55.617]  Exactly.
[01:48:55.617 --> 01:48:58.599]  They can not only mutate, but they also create viral proteins.
[01:48:58.599 --> 01:49:00.420]  Now what do viral proteins do?
[01:49:00.420 --> 01:49:07.463]  They destroy the defenses of an organism against viruses so that it sort of paves the way for the virus to take hold.
[01:49:07.463 --> 01:49:09.364]  So it opens them up for further infections.
[01:49:09.364 --> 01:49:10.485]  Now, if we eat this,
[01:49:10.993 --> 01:49:12.798]  These genetically engineered crops.
[01:49:12.798 --> 01:49:16.729]  We're taking higher levels of these viral proteins into us.
[01:49:16.729 --> 01:49:17.671]  And so we may be
[01:49:18.354 --> 01:49:25.019]  Stripping away our defenses against viruses by eating these genetically modified... And you keep saying, May, we know this is all happening.
[01:49:25.019 --> 01:49:30.063]  And I know execs from these companies listen to these shows and listen to them when they're in the archives.
[01:49:30.063 --> 01:49:33.786]  I mean, no wonder your granddaughter is, is, is, got cancer.
[01:49:33.786 --> 01:49:37.909]  No wonder, you know, you're so sick every day with allergies.
[01:49:37.909 --> 01:49:39.470]  But you're not going to stop, are you?
[01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:42.453]  Because you get to go out on the golf course and swagger around.
[01:49:42.453 --> 01:49:44.614]  You live in a $50 million house.
[01:49:44.614 --> 01:49:46.536]  I want to talk directly to those people.
[01:49:46.536 --> 01:49:47.757]  Why are you doing this?
[01:49:48.177 --> 01:49:49.337]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:49:49.337 --> 01:50:06.503]  Well, you know, not only do we end up with higher levels of viral proteins that might be dismantling your defenses against viruses, but we know that genes can transfer from genetically modified food into our gut bacteria, taking up residence there, and produce, over and over again, these proteins.
[01:50:06.503 --> 01:50:17.366]  So if you happen to eat a Hawaiian papaya or a genetically engineered zucchini or yellow crookneck squash, and if those genes transfer into your gut bacteria and continue to produce it, you may be having these
[01:50:17.802 --> 01:50:20.905]  Viral proteins permanently produced inside your own intestine.
[01:50:20.905 --> 01:50:21.806]  And there's no if.
[01:50:21.806 --> 01:50:27.410]  I've got scores of mainline studies with the measles shot tied to everybody that's got Crohn's.
[01:50:27.410 --> 01:50:31.274]  Yeah, I mean, I always say maybe and could because, you know, that's the way I am.
[01:50:31.274 --> 01:50:33.115]  You could just drop that out if you want.
[01:50:33.115 --> 01:50:36.578]  No, no, I mean, that's separate, but there's an example.
[01:50:36.578 --> 01:50:40.622]  These are genetically engineered, these vaccines, and Crohn's was unknown 50 years ago.
[01:50:40.622 --> 01:50:41.643]  Now it's everywhere.
[01:50:42.796 --> 01:50:49.247]  So, and then they go into the guts and look and it's an autoimmune response and they find that it's impregnated with these viruses in their DNA.
[01:50:49.247 --> 01:50:49.767]  We'll be right back.
[01:50:51.792 --> 01:50:53.794]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[01:50:53.794 --> 01:50:57.417]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[01:50:57.417 --> 01:50:59.880]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:02.943]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[01:51:02.943 --> 01:51:08.728]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[01:51:08.728 --> 01:51:12.672]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[01:51:12.992 --> 01:51:18.214]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[01:51:52.243 --> 01:51:54.304]  Gasoline prices are out of control.
[01:51:54.304 --> 01:51:57.605]  Are you tired of giving your hard-earned dollars to the major oil companies?
[01:51:57.605 --> 01:52:02.186]  Did you know that the oil companies have developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles?
[01:52:02.546 --> 01:52:05.528]  Very few consumers even know such products exist.
[01:52:05.528 --> 01:52:10.531]  SFR has obtained this technology that is backed by testing that the major oil companies have run.
[01:52:10.531 --> 01:52:12.513]  Yet they don't want you to know about them.
[01:52:12.513 --> 01:52:18.497]  This product is made right here in the United States and is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store.
[01:52:18.497 --> 01:52:20.618]  SFR lasts up to six months.
[01:52:20.618 --> 01:52:24.461]  SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars.
[01:52:24.941 --> 01:52:36.331]  SFR recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of $9.95 and get another one free of charge.
[01:52:36.331 --> 01:52:41.636]  If you are not completely delighted with the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping.
[01:52:41.636 --> 01:52:44.899]  Share in the oil company's secret and get SFR now.
[01:52:44.899 --> 01:52:45.619]  Call 888-USE-SFR1.

[01:52:52.426 --> 01:52:52.926]  I'm Dr. Bill
[01:53:07.517 --> 01:53:08.017]  We're good to go.

[01:53:42.724 --> 01:53:46.286]  That number again, 888-212-8871 for the most powerful natural antimicrobial available.
[01:54:03.749 --> 01:54:07.271]  Don't want no shackles.
[01:54:07.271 --> 01:54:13.073]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:54:13.073 --> 01:54:15.874]  Don't want no shackles.
[01:54:15.874 --> 01:54:22.397]  Don't want no shackles on me.
[01:54:22.397 --> 01:54:24.598]  I sat down with Big Brother.
[01:54:24.598 --> 01:54:31.781]  To give you an idea of how much they don't know, just a few years ago they said, oh 95, 96% of the DNA is just junk.
[01:54:34.830 --> 01:54:41.258]  And now the top scientists across the board say it's like claiming they have the genetics of a water buffalo.
[01:54:41.258 --> 01:54:43.941]  No, really, they have a photo of the water buffalo.
[01:54:43.941 --> 01:54:46.384]  Is a photo of a water buffalo a water buffalo?
[01:54:46.384 --> 01:54:46.905]  No, it's not.
[01:54:48.627 --> 01:54:57.834]  And continuing with our guest, Jeffrey Smith, and then I want to jam in a few phone calls here in just a moment.
[01:54:57.834 --> 01:54:59.876]  There are just so many areas to this.
[01:54:59.876 --> 01:55:10.184]  I mean, this is so far along already, and we were just getting into what's happening inside the different organisms out there.
[01:55:10.184 --> 01:55:13.627]  What's some of the other just freakish things that are going on?
[01:55:13.627 --> 01:55:15.509]  Well, they found that
[01:55:16.351 --> 01:55:27.155]  When genetically modified corn transfers its pollen into crops in Mexico that are corn, for some reason they end up like monstrosities.
[01:55:27.155 --> 01:55:34.838]  Absolute monster corn stalks that have multiple ears or weird flowers or 15 feet high.
[01:55:34.838 --> 01:55:38.639]  I've seen some pictures of these and it's just amazing.
[01:55:38.639 --> 01:55:44.661]  We also have the way that government scientists were treated when they talked about the health risks of genetically engineered foods.
[01:55:45.143 --> 01:55:57.866]  From Richard Burrows, who is trying to stop the genetically modified bovine growth hormone from being introduced without more testing, to even the FDA's own scientific panel designed to create the policy on GMOs.
[01:55:57.866 --> 01:56:08.668]  Practically everything they said was discarded and thrown away in favor of the political appointees who were told to promote biotechnology, including Monsanto's former attorney and later vice president.
[01:56:08.668 --> 01:56:12.329]  In fact, reading all these different documents, and I'll spend the time to actually go over them,
[01:56:13.134 --> 01:56:19.198]  You'll have a government study, or even a company study, and their scientists all say, this is bad, this is horrible, this is terrible.
[01:56:19.198 --> 01:56:32.187]  Then the lawyers take it, they rewrite it, and say it's wonderful, and then source the study saying, because we had these scientists work five years on it, never say what the scientists said, and kind of plagiarize and lie, and say that they support it.
[01:56:32.187 --> 01:56:34.088]  I mean, I see that a lot.
[01:56:34.088 --> 01:56:35.429]  Is that really common?
[01:56:35.429 --> 01:56:40.832]  Well, in Seeds of Deception, which you have there, it's exactly what happened with the FDA.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:46.782]  wrote about the fact that GMOs could create allergies, toxins, new diseases, and nutritional problems.
[01:56:46.782 --> 01:56:53.544]  Then the person in charge of policy, Monsanto's former attorney, later their vice president, took them out and made GMOs safe.
[01:56:53.544 --> 01:57:03.887]  Then it was sent to the White House counsel, the lawyer for the White House, and also the Office of Management and Budget, and they complained that it was still showing problems, and they rewrote it again.
[01:57:03.887 --> 01:57:08.609]  So as it got further up the political chain, these GM foods became safer and safer.
[01:57:09.090 --> 01:57:18.738]  But if you trace it back to the science, it turns out they're inherently unsafe, and now we know they may be responsible for a huge amount of increase of problems in the United States.
[01:57:18.738 --> 01:57:22.441]  Well, scientists are pretty much across the board.
[01:57:22.441 --> 01:57:27.285]  It's a very upright, very serious, very focused, and generally moral group.
[01:57:27.285 --> 01:57:31.589]  And I almost always find that the scientists say, don't put this on the market,
[01:57:32.250 --> 01:57:35.893]  But then, the company lies and says, our scientists say it's good.
[01:57:35.893 --> 01:57:38.075]  Yes, you know, I have this interesting quote.
[01:57:38.075 --> 01:57:58.393]  When Monsanto wanted to do a scientific study to prove that BT Cotton, their GM cotton in India, was successful, instead of getting scientists to do their studies, they hired a market research agency that ended up claiming four times the actual reduction in pesticide use, twelve times the actual yield, and a hundred times the actual profit.
[01:57:59.031 --> 01:58:09.597]  So, then you start having one scientific study versus another, and if it's industry-funded studies, well, you know it's designed to avoid finding problems.
[01:58:09.597 --> 01:58:10.818]  Just amazing.
[01:58:10.818 --> 01:58:12.119]  Wesley Smith, stay there.
[01:58:12.119 --> 01:58:15.181]  Later in the next hour, we're going to have some financial news as well.
[01:58:15.181 --> 01:58:18.863]  I'm going to jam in some of your phone calls right after this quick break.
[01:58:18.863 --> 01:58:20.204]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:20.204 --> 01:58:26.327]  The news websites are InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net.
[01:58:33.372 --> 01:58:36.014]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:36.014 --> 01:58:39.295]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:39.295 --> 01:58:43.498]  It is a big idea.
[01:58:43.498 --> 01:58:46.319]  A new world order.
[01:58:46.319 --> 01:58:50.622]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:58:51.206 --> 01:58:54.030]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:58:54.030 --> 01:58:56.834]  Put their objective to be world domination.
[01:58:56.834 --> 01:58:59.998]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:58:59.998 --> 01:59:07.328]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:59:10.359 --> 01:59:15.803]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:59:15.803 --> 01:59:19.665]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:59:19.665 --> 01:59:22.227]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[01:59:22.227 --> 01:59:23.408]  Most people have no idea.
[01:59:23.408 --> 01:59:24.188]  They're not after money.
[01:59:24.188 --> 01:59:25.469]  They have all the money they need.
[01:59:25.469 --> 01:59:26.450]  They're after power.
[01:59:26.450 --> 01:59:27.591]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:59:27.591 --> 01:59:32.354]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[01:59:36.296 --> 01:59:37.077]  Endgame.
[01:59:37.077 --> 01:59:39.118]  Blueprint for global enslaving.
[01:59:39.118 --> 01:59:40.159]  You have been warned.
[01:59:44.242 --> 01:59:46.644]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:46.644 --> 01:59:56.051]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:56.051 --> 01:59:57.812]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:57.812 --> 01:59:59.393]  You want answers?
[01:59:59.393 --> 02:00:01.315]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:01.315 --> 02:00:05.138]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.138 --> 02:00:09.201]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:10.393 --> 02:00:17.237]  It's not your grandpa's plant ecology.
[02:00:17.237 --> 02:00:20.238]  It's not your grandpa's farming.
[02:00:20.238 --> 02:00:24.281]  It's not crossing one soybean with another or one beet with another.
[02:00:24.281 --> 02:00:39.469]  It's taking roach, spider, human DNA, monkey, you name it, putting it in your food, putting viruses in it, everything else you can imagine, randomly blasting different DNA strands just to see what it'll do on huge factory assembly lines, just randomly seeing what'll happen.
[02:00:40.949 --> 02:00:42.570]  We're going to have him back up in the near future.
[02:00:42.570 --> 02:00:44.910]  We're going to have him on two hours because of the financial meltdown.
[02:00:44.910 --> 02:00:46.851]  We're going to cover that coming up now.
[02:00:46.851 --> 02:00:50.332]  And I really appreciate Jeffrey Smith spending time with us.
[02:00:50.332 --> 02:00:51.832]  Check out InfoWars.com.
[02:00:51.832 --> 02:00:58.734]  We're carrying his best-selling book, his new book that's bound to be a best-seller, Jeanette Roulette, Seeds of Deceptions, and the GMO Trilogy.
[02:00:58.734 --> 02:01:02.755]  Again, at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[02:01:02.755 --> 02:01:05.116]  Let's go to some of your calls.
[02:01:05.116 --> 02:01:05.836]  Chris in Florida.
[02:01:05.836 --> 02:01:06.376]  You're on the air.
[02:01:06.376 --> 02:01:08.597]  Go ahead.
[02:01:08.597 --> 02:01:09.357]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:09.357 --> 02:01:09.817]  Hi, go ahead.
[02:01:10.985 --> 02:01:12.867]  Yeah, I'm sorry.
[02:01:12.867 --> 02:01:20.933]  Today, my mother just passed away four days ago, and we had to put her in a hospice.
[02:01:20.933 --> 02:01:27.379]  Actually, I just want to say thanks for doing the show, and how much I appreciate it.
[02:01:27.379 --> 02:01:31.542]  I listen to it every day, and try to do my part.
[02:01:31.542 --> 02:01:32.623]  I had a question for the guests.
[02:01:32.623 --> 02:01:35.785]  Maybe you could speak to it.
[02:01:35.785 --> 02:01:36.846]  It's about the Codex.
[02:01:38.192 --> 02:01:40.253]  Alimentarius, I think it's called?
[02:01:40.253 --> 02:01:44.515]  Yeah, the global move to start restricting vitamins and things, yeah.
[02:01:44.515 --> 02:01:46.036]  Right.
[02:01:46.036 --> 02:02:05.446]  And basically, you know, the hormones that they put in the cows and, you know, just how by 2009 it's supposed to be, you know, all the foods, you know, everything is going to be genetically modified, basically Franken
[02:02:06.457 --> 02:02:10.258]  Well, no, it's not everything, and there's a fight against them.
[02:02:10.258 --> 02:02:11.178]  Jeffrey?
[02:02:11.178 --> 02:02:19.001]  Yes, right now, because of consumer concern around the world, we have stopped their plan to genetically engineer 100% of all commercial seeds.
[02:02:19.001 --> 02:02:21.922]  It is down to only 7 genetically engineered crops.
[02:02:21.922 --> 02:02:30.124]  I recommend also going to DontPlantGMOBeets.org so we can try and keep GM sugar beets from being planted.
[02:02:30.124 --> 02:02:31.684]  DontPlantGMOBeets.org.
[02:02:31.684 --> 02:02:33.845]  But we only have soy, corn, cotton, canola.
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:38.684]  Hawaiian papaya and a little bit of zucchini and crookneck squash right now.
[02:02:38.684 --> 02:02:52.115]  Codex Alimentarius is trying to be... that's a group that's trying to get... to disallow countries to label genetically engineered foods, although almost all commercialized or industrialized countries do have labeling requirements, except the U.S.
[02:02:52.115 --> 02:02:54.376]  and Canada.
[02:02:54.376 --> 02:02:55.517]  All right, sir.
[02:02:55.517 --> 02:02:56.718]  Sorry about your mother, okay?
[02:02:56.718 --> 02:03:01.602]  Chris, anything else?
[02:03:01.602 --> 02:03:02.163]  Okay, thank you.
[02:03:02.901 --> 02:03:04.843]  You know, again, that was a great call.
[02:03:04.843 --> 02:03:06.504]  We only had about a minute and a half for him.
[02:03:06.504 --> 02:03:08.305]  That's the problem, trying to cover everything.
[02:03:08.305 --> 02:03:09.787]  It's impossible.
[02:03:09.787 --> 02:03:12.209]  Who's up next?
[02:03:12.209 --> 02:03:14.430]  Peggy, we only got time for a quick question or comment.
[02:03:14.430 --> 02:03:16.232]  Peggy, go ahead in Pennsylvania.
[02:03:16.232 --> 02:03:21.796]  I wanted to mention another big cover-up that was in the 1970s on trans fats.
[02:03:21.796 --> 02:03:27.000]  Dr. Mary Enig reported to her... reported that the...
[02:03:29.707 --> 02:03:35.431]  People that manufacture margarine and so on had lied about trans fats to the federal government.
[02:03:35.431 --> 02:03:47.739]  And instantly, a few weeks later, she had to meet with representatives from Lever Brothers and Kraft Foods, who were very angry at her and threatened to shut off all her funding if this should ever happen again.
[02:03:47.739 --> 02:03:56.785]  And basically from the 70s to 2006, the big secret about trans fats was covered up that it caused heart attacks.
[02:03:56.785 --> 02:03:58.306]  Yeah, it's basically just a...
[02:04:00.385 --> 02:04:01.165]  It's incredible.
[02:04:01.165 --> 02:04:04.626]  The point is they knew since 78 the harm that it did.
[02:04:04.626 --> 02:04:05.966]  And it just covered it up.
[02:04:05.966 --> 02:04:12.268]  And how many millions of heart attacks were done because big business covered this up?
[02:04:12.268 --> 02:04:14.869]  They're still lying about saturated fats.
[02:04:14.869 --> 02:04:18.270]  And saying that saturated fats such as milk and meat are bad for you.
[02:04:18.270 --> 02:04:22.491]  And then they tell you to eat the stuff they've cooked up in a laboratory.
[02:04:22.491 --> 02:04:23.851]  Thank you, great point.
[02:04:23.851 --> 02:04:25.551]  I wish we could take all the rest of the calls for our guests.
[02:04:25.551 --> 02:04:26.812]  We're going to shift gears in the economy.
[02:04:29.002 --> 02:04:31.785]  I really appreciate you spending time with us, Jeffrey Smith.
[02:04:31.785 --> 02:04:33.407]  Fire out the websites.
[02:04:33.407 --> 02:04:33.867]  Okay.
[02:04:33.867 --> 02:04:40.474]  Responsibletechnology.org and seedsofdeception.com.
[02:04:40.474 --> 02:04:43.217]  I want to get you back up for a part four in the next few weeks, sir.
[02:04:43.217 --> 02:04:43.898]  Will do.
[02:04:43.898 --> 02:04:44.698]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:44.698 --> 02:04:45.519]  Have a great day.
[02:04:45.519 --> 02:04:46.881]  We'll be right back with Bob Chapman.
[02:04:48.843 --> 02:04:51.704]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[02:04:51.704 --> 02:04:53.265]  Loose Change, Final Cut.
[02:04:53.265 --> 02:04:55.426]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:04:55.426 --> 02:04:57.327]  The True Story of the Bilderberg Group.
[02:04:57.327 --> 02:04:58.808]  The Late Great USA.
[02:04:58.808 --> 02:05:00.589]  America, freedom to fascism.
[02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:07.592]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available at truthnews.us and prisonplanet.com.

[02:05:49.068 --> 02:05:49.868]  Hi, neighbor.
[02:05:49.868 --> 02:05:53.169]  They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:05:53.169 --> 02:05:58.451]  Certainly we'd never intend to procrastinate getting our own food supply until there was none left at any price.
[02:05:58.451 --> 02:06:04.193]  We would intend to have plenty of food so the relief organizations could care for those unable to care for themselves.
[02:06:04.193 --> 02:06:11.795]  We would intend not to be standing in the breadline with the ignorant and the foolish who pretend the facts of food disappearance are untrue.
[02:06:11.795 --> 02:06:16.697]  If the experience of the Katrina disaster is evidence, the breadline may have no bread.
[02:06:17.317 --> 02:06:25.141]  Just like the good intentions on the road to that unheavenly place, the good intentions alone to get a supply of food will not feed us.
[02:06:25.141 --> 02:06:30.264]  Only getting our food supply immediately will make us independent and fearless for the future.
[02:06:30.264 --> 02:06:30.564]  Call 800-409-5633.
[02:06:30.564 --> 02:06:30.624]  800-409-5633.
[02:06:30.624 --> 02:06:31.624]  On the web, efoodsdirect.com.
[02:06:31.624 --> 02:06:31.944]  Who am I?
[02:06:31.944 --> 02:06:32.085]  Nobody.
[02:06:32.085 --> 02:06:33.225]  Steve Schenck, Someone Who Cares.
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:50.480]  Fact.
[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:56.503]  Rapid industrialization has resulted in environmental pollution and its curse on world health is staggering.
[02:06:56.503 --> 02:07:00.865]  We live in a toxic world that is bombarded by seven new chemicals each day.
[02:07:00.865 --> 02:07:08.568]  The human body is amazing and efficient in design, but because of the polluted world in which we live, is unable to remove all toxins.
[02:07:08.568 --> 02:07:09.348]  The solution.
[02:07:09.348 --> 02:07:13.290]  Detoxification integrated with Electro-Chi Premier Energy Foot Spa.
[02:07:13.550 --> 02:07:22.698]  The LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa helps to aid in cleansing the body of harmful toxins while energizing and oxygenating your entire body at the cellular level.
[02:07:22.698 --> 02:07:30.905]  Detoxification works with the LectroChi Premier Energy Foot Spa because it addresses the needs of individual cells, the building blocks of human life.
[02:07:30.905 --> 02:07:35.429]  For mental clarity, restored vitality, a stronger immune system, clear skin,
[02:07:35.709 --> 02:07:38.491]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:05.516 --> 02:08:14.121]  All right, Bob Chapman, one of the biggest financial newsletters in modern history.
[02:08:14.121 --> 02:08:20.425]  Started off in army counterintelligence, then worked in every major field of brokerage and analysis.
[02:08:22.092 --> 02:08:24.973]  And stock-broking, just all of it.
[02:08:24.973 --> 02:08:28.854]  Long pedigree, theinternationalforecaster.com.
[02:08:28.854 --> 02:08:32.155]  We had him on yesterday, we're having him back on today.
[02:08:32.155 --> 02:08:46.679]  And I want to talk about... I want to really flesh out his comment that yes, they meant to implode everything and consolidate, as they did in 1929, but this one has gotten away from them.
[02:08:46.679 --> 02:08:49.760]  And I keep quoting a few articles I saw in the Financial Times of London.
[02:08:50.666 --> 02:08:55.510]  Where even more than the Wall Street Journal, the establishment with thin veils admits what they're doing.
[02:08:55.510 --> 02:09:05.878]  And they admitted about two and a half years ago that they were going to implode the housing market, that there was going to be a consolidation of smaller and mid-sized financial institutions.
[02:09:05.878 --> 02:09:13.324]  They also said that it would be very dangerous because either the big boys would get bigger or it could even bring them down.
[02:09:15.289 --> 02:09:18.370]  And now there was a Financial Times of London story saying the same thing yesterday.
[02:09:18.370 --> 02:09:23.513]  There was another London Guardian with their head financial reporter coming out and saying, this is being engineered.
[02:09:23.513 --> 02:09:27.214]  The headline was, America has been conned.
[02:09:27.214 --> 02:09:32.376]  And we have the IMF documents, World Bank documents from 2002 where they said they wanted to do this.
[02:09:32.376 --> 02:09:34.317]  So we know they were planning this.
[02:09:34.317 --> 02:09:43.381]  I want him to specifically explain, and it's not just one lady coming out and saying, hey, this stuff's really junk and it all falls apart, how all this is happening and why he comes to the
[02:09:45.049 --> 02:10:12.804]  The response that he thinks it's it's it's it's out of control because we know that JP Morgan snatching up the third largest brokerage firm Bear Stern yesterday for two dollars a share when it had been trading for 160 plus they bought the whole company for 260 226 million dollars I mean folks that's nothing because they're really buying a bunch of worthless debt they're being backed by the Federal Reserve because they are the Federal Reserve they own a large part of it
[02:10:14.146 --> 02:10:17.128]  So this just looks to me like their plan.
[02:10:17.128 --> 02:10:24.053]  And we know they blow out corporations, they blow out Enron, they love cheating the employees, they love taking their pension funds.
[02:10:24.053 --> 02:10:26.934]  I see this as the master plan to bring in the Amaro.
[02:10:26.934 --> 02:10:28.675]  They have to destroy the dollar first to do that.
[02:10:28.675 --> 02:10:33.619]  The CFR agreed a month ago and said, yeah, they should use this crisis to do that.
[02:10:33.619 --> 02:10:36.841]  I find it more frightening, though, and you bet I'm trying to scare you.
[02:10:36.841 --> 02:10:40.943]  People have emailed me, a few people, most of you know why I'm doing all this, just trying to warn you.
[02:10:40.943 --> 02:10:42.144]  Alex, you're trying to scare people.
[02:10:45.250 --> 02:10:48.834]  You're trying to scare them to buy gold, scare them to buy water filters.
[02:10:48.834 --> 02:10:50.595]  Absolutely!
[02:10:50.595 --> 02:10:52.397]  I'm scared of what's in the water.
[02:10:52.397 --> 02:10:55.139]  I hate the New World Order.
[02:10:55.139 --> 02:11:00.664]  If I can keep this radio show going and pay my employees and operate, you think this is all free?
[02:11:00.664 --> 02:11:05.968]  And morally sell you a good product that I got a tiny percentage of?
[02:11:05.968 --> 02:11:06.589]  Absolutely!
[02:11:07.734 --> 02:11:08.895]  Absolutely.
[02:11:08.895 --> 02:11:16.841]  If I can get you to buy gold when it was $264 an ounce and now it's $1,013 today, absolutely.
[02:11:16.841 --> 02:11:19.263]  Absolutely.
[02:11:19.263 --> 02:11:21.164]  I mean, let's get that straight here.
[02:11:21.164 --> 02:11:25.127]  We need to be scared, just like when you lean out over a cliff, you get scared.
[02:11:25.127 --> 02:11:26.188]  That's an instinct.
[02:11:26.188 --> 02:11:28.230]  You need to pull back from the cliff.
[02:11:28.230 --> 02:11:33.894]  We need to start taking this stuff seriously that is going on and unfolding.
[02:11:33.894 --> 02:11:36.496]  And you better believe I want to wake you up.
[02:11:37.953 --> 02:11:40.134]  I don't want you just shaking in a corner.
[02:11:40.134 --> 02:11:43.275]  I want you to get fired up and decide to fight!
[02:11:43.275 --> 02:11:45.936]  And we'll talk about solutions with Bob Chabon as well.
[02:11:45.936 --> 02:11:48.517]  Bob, thanks for coming on again with us.
[02:11:48.517 --> 02:11:49.958]  You just heard my question.
[02:11:49.958 --> 02:11:55.200]  I'd like you to really analyze with the numbers why you think they're actually losing control.
[02:11:55.200 --> 02:12:01.162]  And then forecast, because we didn't really get into this yesterday in detail, how you see this unraveling.
[02:12:01.162 --> 02:12:05.864]  Well, I believe that the situation that we see today
[02:12:07.089 --> 02:12:12.851]  Is the result of what was planned some time ago.
[02:12:12.851 --> 02:12:15.733]  The plans went in place economically and financially.
[02:12:15.733 --> 02:12:28.438]  And unfortunately for the people who are making the plans, their operations in the Middle East didn't work out as easily and as nicely as they had hoped.
[02:12:28.438 --> 02:12:31.859]  And now they're pinned down there and they're in a morass.
[02:12:31.859 --> 02:12:36.481]  But that didn't allow the economic and financial
[02:12:37.487 --> 02:12:41.429]  Um, operation that they had put into motion to stop.
[02:12:41.429 --> 02:12:43.210]  And so it continued.
[02:12:43.210 --> 02:13:00.757]  And so during the period of time from, uh, the middle of 2002 until now, they have tried to enter into the financial and economic spheres and slow down the process, if not try to retard it for the time being.
[02:13:00.757 --> 02:13:03.258]  Now, that's the reason.
[02:13:03.258 --> 02:13:05.339]  Now, what is going on now?
[02:13:05.339 --> 02:13:06.520]  Well, in order to
[02:13:07.345 --> 02:13:10.466]  Saved the system again, as we all know.
[02:13:10.466 --> 02:13:24.170]  They lowered interest rates, increased money in credit, and gave anybody who wanted or needed a loan, a loan or a mortgage, and now we're beset with the results of that.
[02:13:24.170 --> 02:13:32.412]  That leads us to actually where we are today, in the middle of a credit crisis, which is worse today than it was when it started last August.
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:47.165]  One of the side events of that has been 226 lending institutions that have imploded since a year ago November.
[02:13:47.165 --> 02:13:49.827]  And they are going to continue to implode.
[02:13:49.827 --> 02:14:03.813]  Otherwise, the FDIC wouldn't have asked some 35 professionals to come back from retirement to handle the bankruptcies that they think they're going to get from small and medium-sized banks.
[02:14:05.760 --> 02:14:18.482]  With that said, we look at Wall Street, which is aided and abetted by our government through the Working Group on Financial Markets, which was created under executive order in 1988.
[02:14:18.482 --> 02:14:27.044]  And they, each day, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, rig the markets.
[02:14:27.044 --> 02:14:33.105]  And they had the meeting yesterday, the Working Group on Financial Markets, with the President.
[02:14:33.877 --> 02:14:39.718]  And the Secretary of the Treasury said right after that, we're going to do what we have to do to make things work.
[02:14:39.718 --> 02:14:43.539]  And what he was telling you was, we're going to continue to rig the markets.
[02:14:43.539 --> 02:14:50.140]  So what happens today, the stock markets have 300 points, and the news is absolutely dreadful.
[02:14:50.140 --> 02:14:58.481]  But that's the result of when you have a government that is rigging supposedly free markets.
[02:14:58.481 --> 02:15:01.282]  In that process, we have
[02:15:02.926 --> 02:15:11.470]  A major problem in the last week or so, which you've mentioned, which is Bear Stearns.
[02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:16.873]  And I've got a slightly different take on this than most people.
[02:15:16.873 --> 02:15:25.158]  Last week, their CEO, Mr. Schwartz, was on television on CNBC, and he said, look, everything's fine.
[02:15:25.158 --> 02:15:29.220]  We've got enough money to do what we want to do, and I don't see any problem.
[02:15:30.681 --> 02:15:35.204]  And they had $17 billion in cash.
[02:15:35.204 --> 02:15:45.451]  And mysteriously, simultaneously, all of a sudden, their credit lines were withdrawn.
[02:15:45.451 --> 02:15:48.193]  Their money was taken away from them.
[02:15:48.193 --> 02:15:55.958]  Hedge funds came in and took money back, other banking institutions, and all of a sudden there was a crisis.
[02:15:55.958 --> 02:15:58.560]  I personally think it was planned that way.
[02:16:01.065 --> 02:16:04.848]  I think that Bear Stearns was railroaded.
[02:16:04.848 --> 02:16:11.913]  And I think that the ones that did it were the other major investment banks, particularly the Federal Reserve and J.P.
[02:16:11.913 --> 02:16:16.477]  Morgan Chase, because, number one, they wanted their business.
[02:16:16.477 --> 02:16:21.821]  Number two, Bear Stearns was always a maverick in the business.
[02:16:21.821 --> 02:16:24.783]  They were always, so to speak, shooting from the hip.
[02:16:28.037 --> 02:16:32.178]  Inside, credit and controls were excellent.
[02:16:32.178 --> 02:16:35.059]  There was no reason for this to happen.
[02:16:35.059 --> 02:16:36.659]  And I just think they bagged him.
[02:16:36.659 --> 02:16:41.940]  I think this goes back to 1998 and LTCM.
[02:16:41.940 --> 02:16:50.142]  And LTCM was a hedge fund run by two Nobel Prize winners that went bankrupt.
[02:16:50.142 --> 02:16:51.802]  The bill was about $7 billion.
[02:16:51.802 --> 02:16:56.763]  And in a final analysis, all of the banks put up money to bail it out, got their money back.
[02:16:57.796 --> 02:17:00.758]  But Bear Stearns wouldn't participate.
[02:17:00.758 --> 02:17:03.980]  And I don't think they had forgiven him for that.
[02:17:03.980 --> 02:17:10.185]  You know, it's interesting to see that Bear Stearns couldn't be bailed out by the Fed.
[02:17:10.185 --> 02:17:16.049]  It only could be bought out by JPMorgan Chase with the Fed's money.
[02:17:16.049 --> 02:17:17.070]  Yeah, they can.
[02:17:17.070 --> 02:17:18.311]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:17:18.311 --> 02:17:20.072]  That's a key point, Bob.
[02:17:20.072 --> 02:17:26.597]  And another thing, too, is that Lehman Brothers, I have their expense ratios.
[02:17:27.318 --> 02:17:28.899]  Well, I agree with you, but let me just stop you there.
[02:17:28.899 --> 02:17:29.200]  Let's be clear.
[02:17:51.903 --> 02:17:53.023]  We call it a bailout.
[02:17:53.023 --> 02:18:01.526]  That's our tax money being given to private banks who've also done us the great favor of making loans to anybody and everybody so they get real property.
[02:18:01.526 --> 02:18:03.526]  It's a guaranteed investment for them.
[02:18:03.526 --> 02:18:10.428]  They didn't devalue our currency, and at the same time, we have to pay the taxes on that a double whammy.
[02:18:10.428 --> 02:18:15.410]  So it's the ultimate rigged game, and as you said, instead of having the Federal Reserve, which is
[02:18:16.250 --> 02:18:19.571]  You know, one of the main private shareholders of it is JP Morgan.
[02:18:19.571 --> 02:18:20.331]  Do it.
[02:18:20.331 --> 02:18:32.673]  They just give the money to JP Morgan themselves to then get it so they do get the real asset, what's left, and then leave the shareholders and the people on the ground and the employees, 300,000 of them, holding the back.
[02:18:32.673 --> 02:18:42.175]  I mean, this is a criminal consolidation, and so that's the big question I've got now for you, Bob, and I want you to try to laser beam in on this, and we're going to open the phones up to callers in the segment after that.
[02:18:44.978 --> 02:18:58.623]  That the law was filed by a public interest group, and they're going after Bea Stearns for making inappropriate loans.
[02:18:58.623 --> 02:19:02.724]  That may be so, but then again, all of the banking
[02:19:06.543 --> 02:19:10.287]  I understand that Bob, but let me get my next question out for you, because this is really important.
[02:19:10.287 --> 02:19:13.329]  We need to move on in this discussion, because we can get caught in the minutia.
[02:19:13.329 --> 02:19:14.310]  There's so much of it.
[02:19:14.310 --> 02:19:16.452]  I want the general info for people.
[02:19:16.452 --> 02:19:17.854]  Clearly they engineered this.
[02:19:17.854 --> 02:19:23.839]  We can debate whether it's out of control or not, and whether the establishment itself could be hurt.
[02:19:23.839 --> 02:19:28.984]  But then the big question is, why then, if the government's quote, trying to fix it,
[02:19:31.423 --> 02:19:32.564]  This is out of control.
[02:19:32.564 --> 02:19:37.586]  Why are they doing everything that will deepen it and make it worse?
[02:19:37.586 --> 02:19:39.026]  Like cutting interest rates.
[02:19:39.026 --> 02:19:40.767]  Like increasing spending.
[02:19:40.767 --> 02:19:42.168]  Like bad-mouthing the dollar.
[02:19:42.168 --> 02:19:49.010]  Stay there, Bob Chapman.
[02:19:49.010 --> 02:19:51.511]  It is a big idea.
[02:19:51.511 --> 02:19:53.252]  A new world order.
[02:19:53.252 --> 02:19:57.574]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:19:58.134 --> 02:20:00.977]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[02:20:00.977 --> 02:20:03.760]  Put their objective being world domination.
[02:20:03.760 --> 02:20:06.944]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:20:06.944 --> 02:20:14.272]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:20:17.304 --> 02:20:22.728]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:20:22.728 --> 02:20:26.610]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:20:26.610 --> 02:20:29.172]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[02:20:29.172 --> 02:20:30.353]  Most people have no idea.
[02:20:30.353 --> 02:20:31.133]  They're not after money.
[02:20:31.133 --> 02:20:32.414]  They have all the money they need.
[02:20:32.414 --> 02:20:33.015]  They're after power.
[02:20:33.015 --> 02:20:34.536]  That's what they're after these years.

[02:20:43.241 --> 02:20:46.063]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:20:46.063 --> 02:20:47.104]  You have been warned.
[02:20:48.045 --> 02:20:52.311]  People who use Cardivite know about the pollutants in our body and want them out.
[02:20:52.311 --> 02:20:55.875]  For over five years, Cardivite has proven itself time-tested.
[02:20:55.875 --> 02:20:59.340]  Here's Dr. Mattson, a naturopathic doctor's thoughts on Cardivite.
[02:20:59.611 --> 02:21:02.833]  In our mind, there isn't such a great big mystery to disease anymore.
[02:21:02.833 --> 02:21:08.397]  This basic tenet of yeast and the gut and metals in the liver covers at least 70-80% of the disease that we've seen.
[02:21:08.397 --> 02:21:18.143]  When we do our program, you know, herbal formulas like cardivite and you see someone who could barely walk up a hill now going for regular jobs a few months later, we know we're doing something right.
[02:21:18.143 --> 02:21:19.464]  It's a well-thought-out formula.
[02:21:19.464 --> 02:21:24.928]  I mean, the idea of it working on yeast and metals both at the same time and liver function is dead on.
[02:21:25.428 --> 02:21:29.931]  You'll find, I think, that it'll work more than just on heart problems and circulation problems.
[02:21:29.931 --> 02:21:31.472]  It'll work on other problems as well.

[02:22:01.189 --> 02:22:05.010]  Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for a new independent investigation.
[02:22:05.370 --> 02:22:12.256]  In which family members receive answers to their questions and the true perpetrators of this horrendous crime are brought to justice.
[02:22:12.256 --> 02:22:15.659]  Loose Change Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose.
[02:22:15.659 --> 02:22:23.566]  From hijackers being trained at US military bases to bombs in the buildings, Loose Change Final Cut is the one 9-11 film everyone must see.

[02:22:41.823 --> 02:22:47.148]  Truth is our weapon, and PrisonPlanet.com has the tools you need to take the fight back to Big Brother.
[02:22:47.828 --> 02:22:48.709]  It's a fact.
[02:22:48.709 --> 02:22:56.293]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913, all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue.
[02:22:56.293 --> 02:23:05.439]  With never-ending late fees, over-the-limit fees, and higher and higher interest rates, it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[02:23:05.439 --> 02:23:15.986]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful, attorney-backed program to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit, and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[02:23:16.226 --> 02:23:22.509]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment, ending with nothing on your credit report.
[02:23:22.509 --> 02:23:27.711]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[02:23:27.711 --> 02:23:32.354]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.

[02:23:44.319 --> 02:23:52.142]  Alright, we're back live.
[02:23:52.142 --> 02:24:03.547]  Specifically questions for Bob Chapman about the economy, the inflationary depression that all the experts we've interviewed agree is coming in the next two years or so.
[02:24:03.547 --> 02:24:03.627]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:03.627 --> 02:24:03.687]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:24:12.555 --> 02:24:15.376]  Okay, Bob, you heard my question.
[02:24:15.376 --> 02:24:17.616]  To me, they're accelerating everything.
[02:24:17.616 --> 02:24:21.718]  Cutting interest rates, slashing them, 25, 50 basis points, the whole point.
[02:24:21.718 --> 02:24:23.338]  I mean, they're going to cut it down to zero.
[02:24:23.338 --> 02:24:25.019]  They're going to be out of bullets soon.
[02:24:25.019 --> 02:24:28.079]  That makes everybody flee the dollar even faster.
[02:24:28.079 --> 02:24:34.221]  This is the key, because if the dollar completely plunges in the next six months, won't that bring us into a depression?
[02:24:34.221 --> 02:24:36.462]  Won't that inflation then come home faster?
[02:24:36.462 --> 02:24:38.182]  Won't people then really see?
[02:24:38.182 --> 02:24:39.263]  Won't that accelerate it?
[02:24:39.263 --> 02:24:40.443]  Or you're saying no, two years?
[02:24:43.154 --> 02:24:46.315]  All the things you say, the answer is yes.
[02:24:46.315 --> 02:24:52.156]  What they're doing is they're throwing everything at it that they can to extend the time frame.
[02:24:52.156 --> 02:24:56.357]  They're trying to buy time because there's no way out for them.
[02:24:56.357 --> 02:24:59.037]  We don't know how much time they'll be able to buy.
[02:24:59.037 --> 02:25:02.798]  That's why the accelerated process is going on.
[02:25:02.798 --> 02:25:06.419]  And it'll accelerate until they can't do it anymore.
[02:25:06.419 --> 02:25:09.079]  Yes, they can take interest rates to 1%.
[02:25:09.079 --> 02:25:11.700]  That's not going to help much unless the banks really loosen up.
[02:25:12.082 --> 02:25:13.843]  And they're not going to do that.
[02:25:13.843 --> 02:25:26.392]  One of the most important ways to augment that, the auction window which they're using right now, to the tune of $200 billion a month, they might continue that indefinitely and roll the paper.
[02:25:26.392 --> 02:25:31.936]  Second of all, the money and credit expansion right now, which used to be called M3, is 16.7%.
[02:25:31.936 --> 02:25:33.377]  They could kick it up to 25 or 30%.
[02:25:38.607 --> 02:25:41.230]  They will go out with this as far as they can.
[02:25:41.230 --> 02:25:53.160]  And the longer they are able to go out, the more time they have to write off the debt and have it neutralized by the money and credit that they are creating.
[02:25:53.160 --> 02:26:00.466]  Yes, so they protect themselves and bail themselves out and leave us holding the bag.
[02:26:00.466 --> 02:26:00.947]  Exactly.
[02:26:01.613 --> 02:26:10.195]  And then fake neocons on talk radio, they extrapolate it down to lazy white trash that went out and got loans they shouldn't have.
[02:26:10.195 --> 02:26:22.579]  They never, and that's only one small sector of all this, they never discuss the big brokerage houses, AAA rating junk, paying off insurance companies to rate at AAA, when what the highest securities had like 25% backing.
[02:26:24.219 --> 02:26:27.763]  And then they extrapolate this down to blaming homeless people.
[02:26:27.763 --> 02:26:33.048]  It's their fault this is happening and the bankers sail off in the sunset.
[02:26:33.048 --> 02:26:38.753]  85% of those kinds of problems have to do with the professional lender.
[02:26:38.753 --> 02:26:40.455]  And it's a daisy chain.
[02:26:40.455 --> 02:26:48.643]  It's the Fed, the lender, the mortgage originator, the appraiser, to some extent the salesperson.
[02:26:49.102 --> 02:26:56.611]  And then at the end of the chain, the homeowner, 85-90% of which lied on their application.
[02:26:56.611 --> 02:26:59.474]  There should be criminal charges brought against all of them.
[02:26:59.474 --> 02:27:00.014]  Exactly.
[02:27:00.014 --> 02:27:01.496]  And we don't hear anything about that.
[02:27:01.496 --> 02:27:05.160]  It is just a society gone criminal, Bob.
[02:27:05.160 --> 02:27:05.841]  Absolutely.
[02:27:06.294 --> 02:27:08.214]  Well, everybody thinks it's okay.
[02:27:08.214 --> 02:27:09.315]  Here's my analogy.
[02:27:09.315 --> 02:27:20.036]  It's like a five-year-old who's been told, don't talk to strangers, you know, in the front yard, don't go up to a car if they have candy, they're trying to kidnap you, don't go pet the puppy.
[02:27:20.036 --> 02:27:23.717]  The five-year-old's bad when they go up to the van and pet the puppy.
[02:27:23.717 --> 02:27:30.438]  But who's worse, the five-year-old that didn't mind, or the person that grabs the kid, rapes him, tortures him, kills him in a snuff film?
[02:27:30.438 --> 02:27:33.759]  You know, that's the fellow reserve, and the public's the dumb five-year-old kid.
[02:27:35.996 --> 02:27:37.357]  You're right.
[02:27:37.357 --> 02:27:40.500]  But Rush Limbaugh's... And they run the system, unfortunately.
[02:27:40.500 --> 02:27:44.564]  And the courts rule for them because they own them.
[02:27:44.564 --> 02:27:48.347]  But Rush Limbaugh's gonna blame the five-year-old kid.
[02:27:48.347 --> 02:27:50.309]  He's saying it's all their fault.
[02:27:50.309 --> 02:27:52.071]  It's all their fault.
[02:27:52.071 --> 02:27:56.495]  I mean, it's come out in the news that the lenders would coach the people how to lie, basically.
[02:27:56.495 --> 02:28:00.518]  That the appraisers would go along.
[02:28:00.518 --> 02:28:02.300]  Well, they were also instructed to do so.
[02:28:03.334 --> 02:28:07.357]  And so in that process, they made more money.
[02:28:07.357 --> 02:28:10.239]  Everybody had their hand in the till and nobody cared.
[02:28:10.239 --> 02:28:13.382]  But really, it was all criminal action.
[02:28:13.382 --> 02:28:18.185]  And that's what generated this whole thing to keep the economy floating.
[02:28:18.185 --> 02:28:23.649]  Well, people... and now it'll be 50 times worse when we crash than if they would have just let it go through its normal cycle.
[02:28:23.649 --> 02:28:29.794]  But, uh... I mean, just expanding on that last point, that
[02:28:30.928 --> 02:28:59.231]  that people say there can't be mass conspiracies look at this mass conspiracy and it's even unwritten it's just it's it's that same that same thing happens a lot in history I was reading about the 1730s in England when a similar paper scam I'm sure you're aware of that yeah there's been a number of them going back to probably the most recognizable one was in 1348 the collapse of the Lombard system the same year we were given the plague
[02:29:00.681 --> 02:29:01.903]  Oh man.
[02:29:01.903 --> 02:29:05.566]  And then of course... And they just do it over and over and over again.
[02:29:05.566 --> 02:29:13.315]  It's just today we have communications like your program, and other programs like it, and the internet, and the news gets out fast.
[02:29:13.315 --> 02:29:18.280]  I mean, younger people, people under, say, 40, get 75% of their news off the internet.
[02:29:21.036 --> 02:29:26.398]  It won't be long before there are very few newspapers, magazines, and mainline media.
[02:29:26.398 --> 02:29:27.618]  Well, exactly.
[02:29:27.618 --> 02:29:30.539]  We're coming to the end of a major age.
[02:29:30.539 --> 02:29:34.941]  Reuters yesterday had the headline that new banking system, a new world order.
[02:29:34.941 --> 02:29:39.222]  Stay there, Bob.
[02:29:39.222 --> 02:29:40.623]  We're on the march.
[02:29:40.623 --> 02:29:43.164]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:43.164 --> 02:29:45.865]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:49.224 --> 02:29:51.206]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[02:29:51.206 --> 02:29:58.173]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:29:58.173 --> 02:30:06.580]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:30:06.580 --> 02:30:12.306]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[02:30:12.606 --> 02:30:13.007]  I don't know.

[02:30:48.752 --> 02:30:54.599]  Doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live in a pH balanced alkaline environment.
[02:30:54.599 --> 02:31:00.025]  But as you know, most people are overly acidic due to stress, acidic diet, and lack of exercise.
[02:31:00.025 --> 02:31:05.412]  pH balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health, as well as prevention of disease.
[02:31:05.412 --> 02:31:08.976]  People who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood sugar.
[02:31:09.296 --> 02:31:09.576]  I think so.

[02:32:11.283 --> 02:32:20.874]  Dating back to the late 1800s, Wilhelm Reich Oregon uses cloudbuster technology that can now be applied in your home for dramatic energy savings of up to 25%.

[02:33:31.429 --> 02:33:35.531]  Before we go back to Bob, Aloe Ease Colon and Body Cleanse.
[02:33:35.531 --> 02:33:38.032]  Look, folks, this stuff is amazing.
[02:33:38.032 --> 02:33:41.814]  It's aloe vera concentrated tablets, well known for detoxing.
[02:33:41.814 --> 02:33:44.575]  Aloe vera is just an incredible plant.
[02:33:44.575 --> 02:33:46.055]  Major medical studies on it.
[02:33:46.055 --> 02:33:48.196]  Just Google it, look it up for yourself.
[02:33:48.196 --> 02:33:50.977]  And New Vitality is a major, highly respected company.
[02:33:50.977 --> 02:33:52.258]  We're proud to have them as sponsors.
[02:33:52.881 --> 02:33:57.545]  And they, uh, when they approached us about being sponsors, they said, well, what of all these hundreds of products do you want to promote?
[02:33:57.545 --> 02:34:00.227]  And I said, well, I've used this and I've used this.
[02:34:00.227 --> 02:34:01.588]  And I said, I know these are good.
[02:34:01.588 --> 02:34:04.611]  And I went and wanted to see their stuff, use it a few months ago.
[02:34:04.611 --> 02:34:06.613]  And now here they are as a sponsor.
[02:34:06.613 --> 02:34:09.155]  Uh, aloes, colon and body cleanse.
[02:34:09.155 --> 02:34:10.436]  They don't make any extraordinary claims.
[02:34:10.436 --> 02:34:13.699]  It just cleans out your guts and is a detoxifier.
[02:34:13.699 --> 02:34:14.740]  And it's very important.
[02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:17.522]  It doesn't make you sprout wings and fly around or live forever.
[02:34:17.522 --> 02:34:18.023]  I want to be clear.
[02:34:18.023 --> 02:34:20.745]  I'm not like the other supplement pitchers, and I don't want to be associated with that.
[02:34:21.545 --> 02:34:23.946]  Okay, this is just good stuff.
[02:34:23.946 --> 02:34:27.828]  You heard me eat Dr. Dina Dell alive earlier saying we didn't need vitamins.
[02:34:27.828 --> 02:34:31.849]  Oh yeah, well most of us are mineral deficient and we do need it for that.
[02:34:31.849 --> 02:34:32.149]  See, 1-800-569-4056.
[02:34:32.149 --> 02:34:32.209]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:34:39.555 --> 02:34:41.517]  Uh, for the Aloe Ease Body Cleanse.
[02:34:41.517 --> 02:34:46.942]  They also have Super Beta Prostate, well-documented herb that really helps your prostate health.
[02:34:46.942 --> 02:34:48.684]  And if you're over 40, folks, you should be on it.
[02:34:48.684 --> 02:34:49.305]  1-800-569-4056.
[02:34:49.305 --> 02:34:56.271]  Uh, also, there is the great folks at eFoods Direct.
[02:34:56.271 --> 02:35:01.116]  Uh, they are the oldest continually operating, you know, freeze-dried, dehydrated food company.
[02:35:01.116 --> 02:35:04.299]  Fits in very small areas, very inexpensive, lasts more than 10 years.
[02:35:05.410 --> 02:35:06.470]  Hi, how are y'all doing today?
[02:35:33.552 --> 02:35:34.833]  I went to work yesterday.
[02:35:34.833 --> 02:35:51.646]  I'm a produce delivery around Austin and my boss comes in with a big truck from Dallas and he told me that the truckers were pulling their trucks over and they're not getting ready to but they have already stopped running because of the diesel prices.
[02:35:51.646 --> 02:36:02.895]  I was wondering if y'all could comment on the last time this happened when it bankrupted a lot of the trucking companies and what it might mean for the immediate future because to me it was very alarming.
[02:36:03.331 --> 02:36:11.256]  Okay, but look, big multinationals love this, and they're going to be able to pay the diesel, then run out all the small guys, then jack up prices.
[02:36:11.256 --> 02:36:21.483]  Just like Clear Channel Radio will come in, charge you a dollar a spot in a small town until they bankrupt the other local stations, then it's a hundred dollars a spot once they're gone.
[02:36:21.483 --> 02:36:28.207]  I know a bunch of aggregate haulers in Austin, long haul, short haul, I got a bunch of friends that are truck drivers, they're all going bankrupt.
[02:36:28.607 --> 02:36:30.028]  Exactly the same as yours.
[02:36:30.028 --> 02:36:31.128]  It's as simple as that.
[02:36:31.128 --> 02:36:34.409]  And, you know, diesel and gasoline prices are going to continue to go up.
[02:36:48.314 --> 02:37:03.964]  In fact, a bunch of big brokerage firms said by the end of the year they think we're going to have $175, was in AP yesterday, a barrel of oil, and they talked, like you said, $1,650 an ounce gold.
[02:37:03.964 --> 02:37:09.587]  Well, the Goldman Sachs was the one that said they felt that oil could go to $175.
[02:37:09.587 --> 02:37:12.789]  There's been a number of people who
[02:37:13.759 --> 02:37:23.606]  For some time, Secretary Shultz and Jim Sinclair will call gold at $1,500 and $1,600, and I call it at $3,000.
[02:37:23.606 --> 02:37:39.457]  I moved my estimate up from $2,000 because of the lack of comparison between real inflation and what the government said inflation was since 1980.
[02:37:39.457 --> 02:37:42.900]  But it's going to go considerably higher because
[02:37:43.484 --> 02:37:57.835]  What's happening is the dollar is losing its veracity as a currency, a reserve currency, and that role is going to be taken over by gold, which it has taken over many, many times in history.
[02:37:57.835 --> 02:37:59.877]  Chad, does that answer your question?
[02:37:59.877 --> 02:38:09.885]  Yes, it does, because my next question was, do you think this is, you know, kind of a setup leading toward the NAU, which from y'all's response, it pretty much was pound-plus.
[02:38:10.655 --> 02:38:11.256]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:38:11.256 --> 02:38:12.296]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:12.296 --> 02:38:18.361]  It's in scores of public policy reports that they are going to bring in an economic crisis.
[02:38:18.361 --> 02:38:24.506]  In fact, Robert Pasture last year said, out of the economic crisis, we'll get a North American Union.
[02:38:24.506 --> 02:38:30.510]  They'll tell the public this is the solution when it's the very globalists that have precipitated this atmosphere.
[02:38:30.510 --> 02:38:31.651]  But I think Bob's right.
[02:38:31.651 --> 02:38:35.434]  This is going to implode so bad that a lot of those projects aren't going to get done.
[02:38:35.434 --> 02:38:39.297]  I think their hubris has got... I think they've stepped on their you-know-what, Bob.
[02:38:40.652 --> 02:38:49.880]  Yeah, I also think that they should be seriously considering the fact that when we go into depression that people are going to ask who did this to us.
[02:38:50.470 --> 02:38:54.574]  And they're going to demand that these people be brought to trial.
[02:38:54.574 --> 02:38:58.758]  So I think the court system is going to be kept very busy.
[02:38:58.758 --> 02:39:00.079]  Well, but they're going to do little tricks.
[02:39:00.079 --> 02:39:08.327]  They'll go after low-level people that didn't do anything, or they'll burn a Martha Stewart who did nothing wrong and was running to an American.
[02:39:08.327 --> 02:39:10.189]  Oh, she's worth $100 million.
[02:39:10.189 --> 02:39:12.431]  She's Mrs. Rockefeller.
[02:39:12.431 --> 02:39:14.493]  And then meanwhile, the real criminals didn't get in trouble.
[02:39:16.522 --> 02:39:19.704]  Well, that's true, and that more often is true.
[02:39:19.704 --> 02:39:23.166]  But this is going to be a unique situation.
[02:39:23.166 --> 02:39:26.668]  You're going to have the country in a very, very volatile state.
[02:39:26.668 --> 02:39:33.513]  And, you know, the communications are tremendously different than they were ten years ago.
[02:39:33.513 --> 02:39:41.798]  And when I started talking to people about the problems we have in 1960, it was like being the lone voice of a lone wolf.
[02:39:41.798 --> 02:39:45.300]  Today, there's many people who are talking about it, and people better understand.
[02:39:45.871 --> 02:39:46.811]  That there's a problem.
[02:39:46.811 --> 02:39:51.613]  All I have to do is be told who's doing it to them and point them in the right direction.
[02:39:51.613 --> 02:39:54.414]  Well, I don't mean to do a replay of yesterday, but it's true.
[02:39:54.414 --> 02:40:01.276]  I talked to so many people who've been somehow programmed by the media, the culture, to say, oh, that doesn't affect me.
[02:40:01.276 --> 02:40:03.217]  Oh, Bear Stearns doesn't affect me.
[02:40:03.217 --> 02:40:05.037]  Oh, stock market doesn't affect me.
[02:40:05.037 --> 02:40:06.798]  Oh, it doesn't affect me.
[02:40:06.798 --> 02:40:08.599]  Everything in economics is tied.
[02:40:08.599 --> 02:40:12.240]  You may not own any Bear Stearns folks, but a lot of people do.
[02:40:13.024 --> 02:40:18.648]  You know, people that are going to come into your restaurant aren't going to buy the $50 bottle of wine, they're going to buy the $10 now.
[02:40:18.648 --> 02:40:20.429]  Or maybe they're not even going to go out to eat.
[02:40:20.429 --> 02:40:24.152]  You know, no matter where you work, what industry, this is going to hurt you.
[02:40:24.152 --> 02:40:27.614]  Truck drivers losing their trucks is going to hurt you.
[02:40:27.614 --> 02:40:29.196]  Idiots.
[02:40:29.196 --> 02:40:30.537]  And I'm not trying to be mean, Bob.
[02:40:30.537 --> 02:40:33.899]  It's just, doesn't it make you mad that some people are just so willfully ignorant?
[02:40:35.618 --> 02:40:38.720]  Well, it's part of being human.
[02:40:38.720 --> 02:40:42.381]  People don't like to accept things that are negative.
[02:40:42.381 --> 02:40:42.902]  I do!
[02:40:42.902 --> 02:40:46.484]  They don't like to have to deal with problems.
[02:40:46.484 --> 02:40:47.324]  I want to deal with them!
[02:40:47.324 --> 02:40:48.885]  I don't want bad things to happen!
[02:40:48.885 --> 02:40:49.765]  I want to get out ahead of them!
[02:40:49.765 --> 02:40:53.247]  Well, you're not normal.
[02:40:53.247 --> 02:40:53.907]  And that's true.
[02:40:53.907 --> 02:40:54.708]  I'm not either.
[02:40:54.708 --> 02:40:58.250]  We're paranormal or subnormal or something.
[02:40:58.250 --> 02:40:58.890]  But we're different.
[02:41:00.586 --> 02:41:09.476]  But I don't understand how people think it's a positive attribute to not be involved.
[02:41:09.476 --> 02:41:13.280]  Historically, that leads to ruin.
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:17.424]  Well, we can ask people who lived in Europe in the 1930s what happened.
[02:41:17.424 --> 02:41:19.146]  Ken in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:41:20.081 --> 02:41:25.424]  Yeah, I was wondering, what's going to happen with the insurance companies?
[02:41:25.424 --> 02:41:33.608]  I mean, I'm diabetic, and I'm really concerned about how we're going to be able to get medications, and what's going to happen as far as that's concerned.
[02:41:33.608 --> 02:41:38.751]  I would tell you, I wouldn't panic, but I would start slowly stockpiling.
[02:41:38.751 --> 02:41:41.332]  Medicines last a lot longer than they claim they do, on average.
[02:41:41.332 --> 02:41:46.095]  I'm not giving medical advice, but I would try to build up at least four or five months extra.
[02:41:46.095 --> 02:41:47.756]  But see, that's all watch now, so...
[02:41:49.324 --> 02:41:49.944]  Who knows?
[02:41:49.944 --> 02:41:51.766]  Bob?
[02:41:51.766 --> 02:41:53.487]  Well, I think that's a very good idea.
[02:41:53.487 --> 02:41:56.570]  It's just like stockpiling some food for emergencies.
[02:41:56.570 --> 02:42:00.093]  The same concept of being able to defend yourself.
[02:42:00.093 --> 02:42:02.516]  And I think that's very good advice.
[02:42:02.516 --> 02:42:13.546]  And I don't know where you live, but if you are concerned about government keeping track of how much medication you get, you can always get out into Mexico and buy it.
[02:42:14.292 --> 02:42:17.014]  Yeah, and be real careful about it.
[02:42:17.014 --> 02:42:25.781]  Mark the bottles, and then after they get to be a year old, go ahead and use those on your medication, and then have some others you held back, and do it that way.
[02:42:25.781 --> 02:42:32.306]  But, like Bob said, a few months might be all you need.
[02:42:32.306 --> 02:42:37.170]  Stuff will go crazy for a while, then they'll lock down, then the drugs and things will flow again.
[02:42:37.170 --> 02:42:39.892]  Bob, do you agree with that?
[02:42:39.892 --> 02:42:43.675]  Generally, yes, but you don't know what form it's going to take.
[02:42:44.927 --> 02:42:46.969]  The more prepared you are, the better.
[02:42:46.969 --> 02:42:48.130]  Absolutely.
[02:42:48.130 --> 02:42:50.392]  Boy Scouts, number one rule.
[02:42:50.392 --> 02:42:53.494]  John in California, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:42:53.494 --> 02:43:02.962]  Alex, I'd like to ask you guys a question about these foreclosures on residential and commercial property.
[02:43:02.962 --> 02:43:04.163]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:43:04.163 --> 02:43:11.489]  I know they're going ahead and foreclosing, but I'm just wondering who picks up the tab on the property taxes?
[02:43:11.489 --> 02:43:12.389]  That's a good point.
[02:43:12.389 --> 02:43:13.830]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:43:16.376 --> 02:43:18.038]  Very simply, the lender does.
[02:43:18.038 --> 02:43:23.542]  Have you noticed they forced you to put in like a two or three year escrow?
[02:43:23.542 --> 02:43:24.803]  That ties into that, right, Bob?
[02:43:24.803 --> 02:43:29.247]  Them demanding the escrow for the property tax?
[02:43:29.247 --> 02:43:31.309]  Uh, yes, in part, yes it does.
[02:43:31.309 --> 02:43:36.073]  Can I ask another question, Alex?
[02:43:36.073 --> 02:43:36.473]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:43:37.062 --> 02:43:51.330]  It's a soft topic, but I needed your address, and I talked to John, but he, uh, I forgot to get, I need to get some information to you on a deal that happened up here, and, uh, I needed, uh, the attention to... Attention, Alex Jones.
[02:43:51.330 --> 02:43:52.370]  Attention, Alex Jones.
[02:43:52.370 --> 02:43:54.491]  Okay, I'm gonna get that information to you, buddy.
[02:43:54.491 --> 02:43:56.472]  Thank you, sir, appreciate the call.
[02:43:56.472 --> 02:44:00.815]  Uh, Stephen, Ohio, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:44:00.815 --> 02:44:01.815]  Stephen, Chicago, okay.
[02:44:04.112 --> 02:44:14.234]  Isn't it true that these interest rate cuts are a little more than economic actionism, that they really aren't going to change the fundamentals, the structural problem, and that is that we're debtors?
[02:44:14.234 --> 02:44:20.415]  And what do you think about instituting Basel II reforms?
[02:44:20.415 --> 02:44:32.977]  Well, first of all, if you read the foreign media, you'll find that they're saying exactly what you are, and that is that structurally this is not going to change anything, this being lower interest rates.
[02:44:33.729 --> 02:44:39.831]  Unless lenders were to open up and accommodate those who needed money.
[02:44:39.831 --> 02:44:41.591]  But they're not!
[02:44:41.591 --> 02:44:44.592]  They're hoarding their cash!
[02:44:44.592 --> 02:44:53.715]  Yes, and they don't have any confidence in each other, nor trust in the system anymore, because they were bagged by their own people.
[02:44:53.715 --> 02:44:57.576]  The Basel II Accords, which is the FAS,
[02:45:01.593 --> 02:45:07.474]  I have to mark securities to the market that are in Category 3.
[02:45:07.474 --> 02:45:12.116]  And Category 3 is junk, for all intents and purposes.
[02:45:12.116 --> 02:45:14.856]  And a lot of that hasn't happened yet.
[02:45:14.856 --> 02:45:16.837]  And it's going to happen over the next couple of years.
[02:45:16.837 --> 02:45:31.020]  And that's part of what the Fed is allowing and hoping will evolve for the companies that have all these problems because they own toxic waste, which is bonds that consist of
[02:45:32.350 --> 02:45:37.517]  Mortgages that are not performing.
[02:45:37.517 --> 02:45:38.699]  Okay Steve, thank you for the call.
[02:45:38.699 --> 02:45:44.507]  We're going to come back in the final segment with Bob Chapman, and we're going to take two or three quick final calls.
[02:45:44.507 --> 02:45:47.271]  But now, I want to bring Ted Anderson up.
[02:45:48.098 --> 02:46:02.169]  Okay, every economic expert we have on, and these are all top guys, head of the New York Business School, the head of Shadow Stats, Nobel Prize winners, all of them are saying metals, metals, metals, silver, gold, palladium, platinum.
[02:46:02.169 --> 02:46:03.430]  I think you should be diversified.
[02:46:03.430 --> 02:46:07.393]  If you've got more money than just for a few coins, get into some of the mining stocks.
[02:46:07.393 --> 02:46:09.034]  I'm not going to advise them.
[02:46:09.034 --> 02:46:11.696]  If you want more risk, like Bob was saying, maybe he'll give us some advice.
[02:46:11.696 --> 02:46:14.058]  I know it's in the forecaster.
[02:46:14.058 --> 02:46:16.460]  I just support the network that for twelve years
[02:46:17.302 --> 02:46:20.319]  Uh, has been owned by a little gold company, Ted Anderson.
[02:46:21.451 --> 02:46:24.373]  Who's been interviewing Bob, I know, for more than a decade.
[02:46:24.373 --> 02:46:26.354]  And we're going to bring Ted up just for a minute or two.
[02:46:26.354 --> 02:46:31.777]  Ted, real fast, you've got offers again that you set the price of this at gold at $1,000.
[02:46:31.777 --> 02:46:36.359]  Gold has been going between $1,005 and $1,013 today.
[02:46:36.359 --> 02:46:37.480]  They're trying to suppress it.
[02:46:37.480 --> 02:46:39.641]  It's not working.
[02:46:39.641 --> 02:46:42.743]  And I know I just got a little bit more silver, a little bit more gold from you.
[02:46:42.743 --> 02:46:45.004]  You know, I don't have a lot of money, but I buy a little here, a little there.
[02:46:45.004 --> 02:46:46.405]  It builds up.
[02:46:46.405 --> 02:46:48.266]  Tell folks about the offer you've got today.
[02:46:49.013 --> 02:46:49.774]  Of course, Alex.
[02:46:49.774 --> 02:46:51.975]  Right now we have the British Sovereign coin.
[02:46:51.975 --> 02:46:54.437]  It's a real good coin out of Europe.
[02:46:54.437 --> 02:46:57.259]  A quarter ounce gold piece and it's trading at $277 per coin.
[02:46:57.259 --> 02:46:59.440]  We also have the Frank coin right now at $220.
[02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:01.762]  Again, that's one-fifth of an ounce of gold.
[02:47:06.505 --> 02:47:21.422]  And then you can we have those walking Liberty half rolls and that's a really good way to get into silver right now I know Bob is talking about $100 an ounce silver Roughly $3,000 gold silver has a lot more room to move plus also you need small denominational stuff for security purposes
[02:47:21.842 --> 02:47:26.966]  By the way, I was looking up other places to buy silver before I bought it from you last night, Ted.
[02:47:26.966 --> 02:47:43.038]  I mean, I look at other places, and most silver dollars are $25, even if it's junk, been circulated, can hardly read the date, $25 per coin, with silver above $20 an ounce right now, and you're selling half dollars.
[02:47:43.038 --> 02:47:43.859]  Does it come out to $21 a piece?
[02:47:43.859 --> 02:47:45.240]  $10.50 a piece, or $21 for two, which is the
[02:47:49.623 --> 02:47:52.504]  Well, it's essentially a dollar over spot or a little bit more than a dollar.
[02:47:52.504 --> 02:47:53.044]  Yes, it's a good deal.
[02:48:08.700 --> 02:48:17.762]  Well, all I know is, why if it's only a dollar over spot, you think that'd be pretty much a decent deal, but why is it so much more everywhere else, Ted?
[02:48:17.762 --> 02:48:20.042]  Are they running out of supply of silver?
[02:48:20.042 --> 02:48:21.843]  I mean, yeah, silver dollars especially.
[02:48:21.843 --> 02:48:33.425]  I know that we've sold an awful lot of those silver dollars and I have dealers breaking up brilliant uncirculated rolls and delivering them to me as though they're circulated because there's no circulated silver dollars left to sell.
[02:48:34.545 --> 02:48:38.928]  The Walking Liberty Halves just happened to be one of the coins that are still in supply at this time.
[02:48:38.928 --> 02:48:43.911]  There's so many orders that are going on right now, it's like if I pick a product... Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:48:43.911 --> 02:48:54.217]  You can't pretty much give people a good deal on silver dollars anymore because they're selling for $5 over spot, so you're giving them half dollars at just a dollar over spot per ounce.
[02:48:54.217 --> 02:48:57.419]  Folks, I mean, and you say those are getting a little scarce too, Ted?
[02:48:57.719 --> 02:48:59.240]  Yeah, everything's getting scarce right now.
[02:48:59.240 --> 02:49:04.883]  I mean, just like Bob was saying, I mean, there's enough trouble in the economy and everybody's starting to pay attention now.
[02:49:04.883 --> 02:49:08.505]  And people are placing orders not only with my firm, but firms all over across the country.
[02:49:08.505 --> 02:49:10.086]  And Bob, isn't that the key?
[02:49:10.086 --> 02:49:19.371]  That if you've only got 3% of the people in the market buying, if 6%, 10%, or even 5%, a few more percentage come in, that it's really going to drive it up.
[02:49:20.788 --> 02:49:38.814]  Well, Ted will tell you, as well as I, he being almost as old as I am, that the last time around, at best, we had a maximum of 15% of the people involved in any way with the gold and silver move into 1978-81.
[02:49:38.814 --> 02:49:43.375]  And today, I would say it's 1% or 2%, so there's a lot of people who are going to come into these markets.
[02:49:43.905 --> 02:49:48.787]  And there's a lot more people too, Bob, and we're talking about the same supply that's finite.
[02:49:48.787 --> 02:49:52.949]  You're talking about walking liberty halves, and they stopped making those in the 1940s.
[02:49:52.949 --> 02:49:55.029]  Yeah, let's be clear.
[02:49:55.029 --> 02:49:57.610]  The supply is already running out of a lot of this.
[02:49:57.610 --> 02:49:59.631]  And by running out, the price is exploding.
[02:49:59.631 --> 02:50:01.412]  Getting these near spot is running out.
[02:50:01.412 --> 02:50:03.493]  He's got great deals on gold, silver, 800, 686, 2237.
[02:50:03.493 --> 02:50:04.513]  I love doing this.
[02:50:04.513 --> 02:50:05.674]  I love plugging something I believe in.
[02:50:09.715 --> 02:50:11.616]  I love plugging something that's a good deal.
[02:50:11.616 --> 02:50:14.536]  You hurt the New World Order folks when you move out of dollars.
[02:50:14.536 --> 02:50:15.877]  The whole world's moving out.
[02:50:15.877 --> 02:50:17.677]  They don't take dollars at the Taj Mahal.
[02:50:17.677 --> 02:50:19.758]  They don't take them in Brazil.
[02:50:19.758 --> 02:50:22.338]  They don't take them in, I mean, they're dumping it everywhere.
[02:50:22.338 --> 02:50:22.398]  800-686-2237.
[02:50:22.398 --> 02:50:22.458]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:28.820]  It is a big idea.
[02:50:28.820 --> 02:50:29.321]  A new world order.
[02:50:29.321 --> 02:50:31.662]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[02:50:58.530 --> 02:51:01.333]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[02:51:01.333 --> 02:51:04.135]  Don't their objective be world domination?
[02:51:04.135 --> 02:51:07.319]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[02:51:07.319 --> 02:51:14.646]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[02:51:17.662 --> 02:51:23.106]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[02:51:23.106 --> 02:51:26.968]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[02:51:26.968 --> 02:51:29.550]  Bill of Arrogance makes great progress toward a world with government.
[02:51:29.550 --> 02:51:30.531]  Most people have no idea.
[02:51:30.531 --> 02:51:31.491]  They're not after money.
[02:51:31.491 --> 02:51:32.772]  They have all the money they need.
[02:51:32.772 --> 02:51:33.753]  They're after power.
[02:51:33.753 --> 02:51:34.914]  That's what Apple needs here.

[02:52:48.462 --> 02:52:51.565]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[02:52:51.565 --> 02:52:57.090]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[02:52:57.090 --> 02:53:02.795]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:53:02.795 --> 02:53:04.276]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[02:53:04.276 --> 02:53:13.284]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[02:53:13.584 --> 02:53:15.426]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[02:54:05.593 --> 02:54:09.237]  TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:54:09.237 --> 02:54:13.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Bernie, then Rick, and Zach.
[02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:14.582]  That's all we have time for.
[02:54:14.582 --> 02:54:19.707]  We'll have Bob back up for another hour in the next few weeks to take calls again.
[02:54:19.707 --> 02:54:21.228]  Bernie in Michigan, you're on the air.
[02:54:21.228 --> 02:54:21.569]  Go ahead.
[02:54:22.062 --> 02:54:23.102]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:54:23.102 --> 02:54:28.663]  Bob, I gotta tell you, I told the stockbroker about your website, and he called me back.
[02:54:28.663 --> 02:54:30.584]  He should have heard the expletives.
[02:54:30.584 --> 02:54:31.604]  Praising you.
[02:54:31.604 --> 02:54:36.445]  Anyways, my dad's on a fixed income, and, um, stocks.
[02:54:36.445 --> 02:54:38.985]  He's got, uh, precious metals and paper.
[02:54:38.985 --> 02:54:40.466]  I keep telling him.
[02:54:40.466 --> 02:54:41.566]  Same thing everyone else says.
[02:54:41.566 --> 02:54:42.266]  Get out now!
[02:54:42.266 --> 02:54:46.387]  Yeah, well, herein lies the problem.
[02:54:46.387 --> 02:54:50.148]  Being on a fixed income, I told him, I said, dump it.
[02:54:50.148 --> 02:54:51.228]  I said, take the hit.
[02:54:51.818 --> 02:54:54.779]  And by real possession.
[02:54:54.779 --> 02:54:57.020]  Now, am I all wet or am I on track?
[02:54:57.020 --> 02:54:58.501]  Well, he wants to diversify.
[02:54:58.501 --> 02:55:02.423]  Let's get Bob's take.
[02:55:02.423 --> 02:55:06.425]  Well, I think it all depends on the person's situation.
[02:55:06.425 --> 02:55:09.526]  And it's good to have both coins and shares.
[02:55:09.526 --> 02:55:14.488]  It all depends on how much speculation you want to get involved in.
[02:55:14.488 --> 02:55:16.509]  Every case is different.
[02:55:16.509 --> 02:55:20.551]  And if the person has very little income,
[02:55:22.713 --> 02:55:25.834]  And just kind of squeaking through and would like to get involved.
[02:55:25.834 --> 02:55:27.675]  The best way to go is in coins.
[02:55:27.675 --> 02:55:34.558]  That's why I was saying, if they're barely squeaking by, things are so unstable, regular stocks are in deep trouble.
[02:55:34.558 --> 02:55:43.402]  I mean, if I was him, I don't know the situation, but if I was 75, 80 years old, squeaking by and I had a bunch of money in the stock market, baby, 90% would be out.
[02:55:43.402 --> 02:55:44.723]  Bob?
[02:55:44.723 --> 02:55:50.045]  Incidentally, I agree with you completely, and we told people eight months ago,
[02:55:50.692 --> 02:55:58.735]  When the Dow is trading between $13.00, $5.00, and $14.00 to get out, and we still are telling people to get out.
[02:55:58.735 --> 02:56:07.417]  And if you don't want to get into gold and silver-related assets, at least get into a money market fund so you're out of harm's way to an extent.
[02:56:07.417 --> 02:56:14.339]  But, but, but, do you agree, Bob, a basket of foreign currencies, because they're going to be volatile as well?
[02:56:14.339 --> 02:56:19.621]  Well, my answer to that, for those who don't want to go into that venue, gold and silver,
[02:56:20.260 --> 02:56:22.862]  is to buy Swiss franc government bonds.
[02:56:22.862 --> 02:56:24.602]  It's the hardest currency in the world.
[02:56:24.602 --> 02:56:27.804]  It yields about 1.6%.
[02:56:27.804 --> 02:56:30.826]  And if that's where you have to be, that's where you have to be.
[02:56:30.826 --> 02:56:31.326]  Okay.
[02:56:31.326 --> 02:56:34.868]  And that is the best recommendation I can make in that area.
[02:56:34.868 --> 02:56:40.691]  And people who have been in those bonds for the last year are up 20-25%.
[02:56:40.691 --> 02:56:41.672]  Wow.
[02:56:41.672 --> 02:56:43.453]  Bernie, thank you.
[02:56:43.453 --> 02:56:44.633]  Rick, quickly in Maryland.
[02:56:44.633 --> 02:56:46.314]  You're on the air.
[02:56:46.314 --> 02:56:46.734]  Hi, Bernie.
[02:56:48.678 --> 02:56:53.040]  The Treasury Department deciding on what foreigners can buy in this country.
[02:56:53.040 --> 02:56:58.782]  Wouldn't the Chinese come in and buy a lot of companies for a dime or a dollar?
[02:56:58.782 --> 02:56:59.562]  They're already doing it.
[02:56:59.562 --> 02:57:01.403]  The Arabs, all the ports, the roads.
[02:57:01.403 --> 02:57:06.305]  They're basically buying the cities now, like in Robocop, where the private corps take over the cities.
[02:57:06.305 --> 02:57:08.306]  Bob Chapman?
[02:57:08.306 --> 02:57:17.229]  You're right, and they're headed also to things that people need, and that is turning roads into toll roads, buying utilities,
[02:57:17.905 --> 02:57:18.606]  I don't know.
[02:57:32.435 --> 02:57:35.256]  Gold, silver, that's about the only stuff you can physically hold.
[02:57:35.256 --> 02:57:37.717]  Zach in Canada, you're our tail gunner with Bob Chapman.
[02:57:37.717 --> 02:57:38.457]  Go ahead.
[02:57:38.457 --> 02:57:39.097]  Hey, good day guys.
[02:57:39.097 --> 02:57:48.620]  Yeah, I was surfing the net yesterday and I went on over to Yahoo.com to go check my email and I noticed in the news there was a car, they said, got unreal gas mileage.
[02:57:48.620 --> 02:57:57.183]  So I opened up the info and it was apparently the gas companies have a competition to see who can make the best vehicle with gas mileage and that.
[02:57:58.030 --> 02:58:05.255]  And anyway, this car got the winner, got 7,138 miles to the gallon.
[02:58:05.255 --> 02:58:06.215]  Yeah, I saw that.
[02:58:06.215 --> 02:58:07.076]  I saw that in Yahoo, too.
[02:58:07.076 --> 02:58:08.236]  Do you have a question?
[02:58:08.236 --> 02:58:08.857]  Unbelievable.
[02:58:08.857 --> 02:58:10.658]  Look, I'm going to slap him in the face.
[02:58:10.658 --> 02:58:11.779]  Call me back about it tomorrow.
[02:58:11.779 --> 02:58:13.980]  Bob Chapman, TheInternationalForecaster.com.
[02:58:13.980 --> 02:58:14.841]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:58:14.841 --> 02:58:16.542]  Thanks for all the analysis.
[02:58:17.902 --> 02:58:18.683]  Bye-bye.
[02:58:18.683 --> 02:58:19.704]  All right, folks.
[02:58:19.704 --> 02:58:21.426]  Retransmission starts now on the internet.
[02:58:21.426 --> 02:58:25.110]  If you missed any of the first or second hour, I had Dr. Dina Dell on for a debate.
[02:58:25.110 --> 02:58:25.971]  It restarts now.
[02:58:25.971 --> 02:58:27.993]  We'll see it in the streams at Infowars.com.
[02:58:27.993 --> 02:58:31.056]  That's where you come listen.

[02:58:39.181 --> 02:58:41.183]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees.
[02:58:41.183 --> 02:58:44.807]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[02:58:44.807 --> 02:58:47.270]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[02:58:47.270 --> 02:58:50.334]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[02:58:50.334 --> 02:58:56.120]  It is essential that Patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order Master Plan.
[02:58:56.120 --> 02:59:00.065]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[02:59:00.385 --> 02:59:05.606]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.
