[00:49.640 --> 00:54.320]  in the second hour when Alex calls calls us up here and he's also on his way down to a
[00:54.320 --> 00:59.480]  quote-unquote free speech zone that's what America's come down to free speech zones whenever

[01:03.640 --> 01:08.400]  there but Cindy Sheehan should be there hopefully we'll get a couple words with her I really
[01:08.400 --> 01:14.400]  wanted to play you the Jerome Corsi interview that I saw go out live on Justin TV but for
[01:14.400 --> 01:18.640]  some reason is not archived and I want to remind all the listeners out there if you

[01:28.600 --> 01:35.200]  press play just it just really revolutionary radio all week with Alex making national
[01:35.200 --> 01:40.000]  headlines by bullhorning MSNBC by confronting Michelle Malkin we're also gonna have that
[01:40.000 --> 01:45.760]  inside edition clip for you it's only about 90 seconds it was pretty fair I was expecting
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.280]  a lot more of a hit piece they did not try to claim that Alex had killed Michelle Malkin
[01:50.280 --> 01:55.360]  Michelle Malkin even admitted that Alex did not say kill Michelle Malkin on that pajamas
[01:55.360 --> 02:00.760]  radio broadcast like a you know it's one of those little podcasts they put out for their
[02:00.760 --> 02:05.240]  ultra right wing nonsense that's total and complete lies I went over there and I downloaded
[02:05.240 --> 02:11.200]  I listened to a little bit of it last night and folks I'm not kidding you on their website
[02:11.200 --> 02:16.440]  they show a picture of Barack Obama who we all know I'm no fan of speaking out against
[02:16.440 --> 02:20.240]  the quote unquote surge remember the surge was gonna end the war give me a break the
[02:20.240 --> 02:28.000]  surge unreal so it was along the lines of Barack Obama said that the search had failed
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.840]  and on their site these people are so discussing they they it actually fades in and says the
[02:32.840 --> 02:38.480]  surge worked and it shows a picture of three soldiers that were willing to go on camera
[02:38.480 --> 02:41.400]  and have no idea what they're talking about saying the surge worked and they're working
[02:41.400 --> 02:47.040]  for freedom guys uh you know I'm not trying to disrespect soldiers here but these do not
[02:47.040 --> 02:52.920]  look like intelligent man it looks like you know three out of a thousand soldiers you
[02:52.920 --> 02:56.520]  know that they would pick to actually say that they want to be there those soldiers want
[02:56.520 --> 03:01.360]  out man all the soldiers I talked to you know in the army the national guards the marines
[03:01.360 --> 03:06.920]  they want out they say why are we here every time I see them in a bar or on the street
[03:06.920 --> 03:14.120]  or in a mall you know I had a one guy asked me if my info wars dot com uh bracelet that
[03:14.120 --> 03:20.640]  I proudly rock all the time man I was a veteran and I explained to him that no I'm not a veteran
[03:20.640 --> 03:24.080]  and uh you know I'm actually trying to work for us to get out of the war but uh you know
[03:24.080 --> 03:30.120]  I respect our our soldier service in that I realized without a military our power is
[03:30.120 --> 03:35.200]  gone and we obviously need a strong defense system but the problem is that our military
[03:35.200 --> 03:38.760]  really no longer works for the United States for the Constitution for the Bill of Rights
[03:38.760 --> 03:45.920]  it works for the corporate interests in this country in this world and this is about globalism
[03:45.920 --> 03:51.880]  that's why later on we're going to get into Putin accuses us of orchestrating uh the Georgian
[03:51.880 --> 03:58.400]  attack and of course they are but they'll say oh Putin has no evidence of this really
[03:58.400 --> 04:03.960]  even though he brings up the fact that Georgian forces and other invaded south Ossetia or
[04:03.960 --> 04:09.980]  Ossetia and murdered some of their peacekeepers oh they didn't they weren't the aggressors
[04:09.980 --> 04:14.080]  and just came in and murdered some peacekeepers started killing civilians you know rushes
[04:14.080 --> 04:19.040]  the bad guy here please I am no old fan of Putin but give me a break and of course the
[04:19.040 --> 04:24.280]  Dallas Morning News uh close enough to Texas well in Texas I mean Austin uh about three
[04:24.280 --> 04:28.560]  hours away from here is now saying that Alex Jones of course said kill Michelle Malcom
[04:28.560 --> 04:33.480]  now I expected this in some of the international press and by some of the right wing blogs

[08:38.520 --> 08:44.920]  that uh... that jones coursey interview was top notch uh... although coursey again retracted
[08:44.920 --> 08:48.040]  on nine eleven truth and said he looked at the steven jones stuff and he doesn't agree
[08:48.040 --> 08:48.960]  with it
[08:48.960 --> 08:51.640]  uh... he was spot on about obama
[08:51.640 --> 08:54.360]  he talked about how he was going to have a
[08:54.360 --> 08:58.440]  uh... seventy page rebuttal or referendum i guess it was called
[08:58.440 --> 09:04.160]  to the rebuttal by the obama camp he is about to spend out the fourth week at number one
[09:04.160 --> 09:07.400]  on the new york times bestseller list let me repeat that for you
[09:07.400 --> 09:09.760]  he's about to spend the fourth week
[09:09.760 --> 09:14.400]  as a number one on the new york times bestseller list
[09:14.400 --> 09:16.480]  and instead of attacking
[09:16.480 --> 09:18.240]  the content of his book although
[09:18.240 --> 09:20.080]  he told her mended that slightly
[09:20.080 --> 09:24.040]  uh... with some minute points by the way nothing major in my opinion that he got
[09:24.040 --> 09:25.440]  wrong
[09:25.440 --> 09:28.520]  uh... they're trying to attack him on his character they're trying to attack him on
[09:28.520 --> 09:32.200]  his association with nine eleven truth they really don't like
[09:32.200 --> 09:34.920]  that uh... he's putting their golden boy
[09:34.920 --> 09:39.920]  in a subpar if not negative light
[09:39.920 --> 09:44.240]  uh... so uh... you know hopefully that course interview will be posted sometime
[09:44.240 --> 09:46.720]  today may well you get played for you on the show
[09:46.720 --> 09:50.560]  we're also hoping to post some of that more yellow stuff as well
[09:50.560 --> 09:51.640]  that'd be exciting
[09:51.640 --> 09:53.700]  if we're actually able to uh...
[09:53.700 --> 09:57.280]  play that on big fan of tomorello uh... lead guitarist for rage against the
[09:57.280 --> 09:59.500]  machine and audio slave and
[09:59.500 --> 10:00.720]  really a uh...
[10:00.720 --> 10:04.120]  an instrumental revolutionary if he's if he's not even a revolutionary
[10:04.120 --> 10:06.520]  otherwise is a smart guy harvard educated
[10:06.520 --> 10:07.600]  a little bit too
[10:07.600 --> 10:09.020]  socialist a little bit too
[10:09.020 --> 10:10.800]  left-leaning for my opinion
[10:10.800 --> 10:14.120]  but uh... i'm a big fan of the night watchman which is a acoustic album i mean
[10:14.120 --> 10:16.260]  this guy's got projects all over the place and
[10:16.260 --> 10:18.120]  i'm sure a lot of my listeners
[10:18.120 --> 10:19.280]  understand uh...
[10:19.280 --> 10:22.520]  his gravitas if you will i mean uh... he's close to michael more
[10:22.520 --> 10:26.080]  michael moore's done a couple of their music videos he just did uh...
[10:26.080 --> 10:28.160]  the music video for uh...
[10:28.160 --> 10:29.960]  one of the soundtracks to sicko
[10:29.960 --> 10:30.920]  in other words uh...
[10:30.920 --> 10:35.000]  tomorell's on that soundtrack to sell he's got a pretty broad influence not
[10:35.000 --> 10:36.360]  that show on pan
[10:36.360 --> 10:40.720]  and uh... josh brolin don't but i i i tend to gravitate more towards music
[10:40.720 --> 10:42.280]  than actors uh...
[10:42.280 --> 10:45.240]  because i can listen to music again again again how many times can you really
[10:45.240 --> 10:47.120]  watch a movie no matter how good it is
[10:47.120 --> 10:49.440]  i guess that's just my humble opinion
[10:49.440 --> 10:51.040]  so let's read this article
[10:51.040 --> 10:53.840]  out of info wars dot com by court curtain email
[10:53.840 --> 10:55.400]  that quotes the uh...
[10:55.400 --> 10:57.760]  dallas morning news
[10:57.760 --> 10:59.120]  and we're gonna give up the number
[10:59.120 --> 11:02.320]  hopefully to the editor we want you to call the dallas morning news editor
[11:02.320 --> 11:05.680]  if anyone's got that number call in please and let us know what it is
[11:05.680 --> 11:08.920]  uh... we don't want subscriptions we don't even want the writers number we
[11:08.920 --> 11:12.840]  want the editor because again they libel to alex jones in the circle
[11:12.840 --> 11:16.440]  it's no longer simply the neocon blogger spreading lies about alex jones
[11:16.440 --> 11:19.960]  now the dallas morning news has engaged in slander
[11:19.960 --> 11:21.640]  mark davis described as
[11:21.640 --> 11:25.480]  a radio guy and they contribute or a contributing columnist
[11:25.480 --> 11:28.960]  the newspaper's opinion blog rights
[11:28.960 --> 11:32.280]  conservative writer and blogger michelle malkin was apparently attacked by
[11:32.280 --> 11:34.080]  violent idiots yesterday
[11:34.080 --> 11:35.440]  okay no one attacked her
[11:35.440 --> 11:36.560]  no one was violent
[11:36.560 --> 11:41.120]  and she's not conservative okay she's anything about conservative
[11:41.120 --> 11:46.560]  she's into big government and big wars that is not conservative
[11:46.560 --> 11:52.160]  what are people gonna get that through their head okay uh... the definition
[11:52.160 --> 11:56.320]  this supposed uh... republican conservative movement is supposed to be
[11:56.320 --> 12:00.400]  less government intrusion less federal programs
[12:00.400 --> 12:02.000]  not nation building
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.880]  and we all know that it's the complete opposite but
[12:04.880 --> 12:07.360]  monsters like michelle malkin will tell you
[12:07.360 --> 12:11.320]  now we're doing this for the freedom and i'm really behind the conservative
[12:11.320 --> 12:13.040]  movement and
[12:13.040 --> 12:16.720]  jackass is like mark davis buy into it and then right
[12:16.720 --> 12:18.640]  ridiculous hip pieces
[12:18.640 --> 12:23.080]  egged on by one of the most repugnant human beings attending this convention
[12:23.080 --> 12:24.960]  and the competition for the title
[12:24.960 --> 12:26.000]  is crowded
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.360]  and the competition for the title is good
[12:27.360 --> 12:28.280]  okay so
[12:28.280 --> 12:31.560]  alex jones the most repugnant human being in denver right now apparently to
[12:31.560 --> 12:32.880]  mark davis uh...
[12:32.880 --> 12:34.840]  mark when he say that to his face
[12:34.840 --> 12:37.280]  column or a public human being has to be
[12:37.280 --> 12:41.160]  one of my heroes and uh... one of my very very good friends as well and uh...
[12:41.160 --> 12:44.520]  i'm glad he's out there he's far from repugnant
[12:44.520 --> 12:45.400]  no one
[12:45.400 --> 12:48.440]  no one else seems to have the vocals no one else seems to have the drive the
[12:48.440 --> 12:49.520]  desire
[12:49.520 --> 12:51.240]  to continue
[12:51.240 --> 12:53.840]  to confront evil in all of its forms
[12:53.840 --> 12:55.760]  whether it's in its media form
[12:55.760 --> 12:57.960]  it's mainline media format
[12:57.960 --> 13:01.280]  another thing i really hate about michelle malkin
[13:01.280 --> 13:04.240]  is that she's trying to say that she's new media
[13:04.240 --> 13:06.120]  you guessed host the orally show
[13:06.120 --> 13:07.800]  you're on fox radio
[13:07.800 --> 13:10.240]  and your little bloggers are nothing but
[13:10.240 --> 13:13.560]  a parade of applauders that i wouldn't be surprised
[13:13.560 --> 13:16.120]  well they're main funding if you look at all these advertisements
[13:16.120 --> 13:18.280]  is by homeland security another
[13:18.280 --> 13:20.440]  alphabet agencies
[13:20.440 --> 13:23.760]  they they are state sponsored government sponsored whatever you want column
[13:23.760 --> 13:26.080]  uh... just in their advertising alone but i wouldn't
[13:26.080 --> 13:28.680]  be surprised if they were going to be a uh... kickback in their
[13:28.680 --> 13:30.000]  in their uh... checks
[13:30.000 --> 13:31.600]  i also want to point out that on their
[13:31.600 --> 13:34.480]  little radio show they had to admit that the people who were calling for
[13:34.480 --> 13:35.560]  michelle malkin
[13:35.560 --> 13:37.600]  that and i'm this is michelle malkin and uh...
[13:37.600 --> 13:40.680]  pajamas media guys and these other losers
[13:40.680 --> 13:44.240]  saying all right yeah alex wasn't calling for their death and those guys
[13:44.240 --> 13:47.160]  were kind of provocaturing and they were talk calling
[13:47.160 --> 13:50.280]  alex a capitalist pig so they were there just to cause trouble
[13:50.280 --> 13:52.840]  and we already knew that
[13:52.840 --> 13:57.160]  all right let's get back to this libel article from the dallas morning news
[13:57.160 --> 14:00.400]  i refer to the pretentious alex jones who hosts
[14:00.400 --> 14:03.760]  what passes for a radio talk show on a few stations
[14:03.760 --> 14:07.840]  unwise enough to carry it a few stations
[14:07.840 --> 14:10.720]  uh... number one talk show host
[14:10.720 --> 14:12.240]  on shout cast

[15:53.360 --> 15:56.720]  after all that disgusting repugnant stuff that he did say about alex this is
[15:56.720 --> 16:01.360]  where it truly just gets into total incomplete line
[16:01.360 --> 16:05.440]  it wasn't before that but in shouting kill michelle melkin at a protest yet

[16:09.480 --> 16:12.920]  despicable soul whom i would identify as a blight
[16:12.920 --> 16:17.280]  on my industry if i actually consider to be part of it
[16:17.280 --> 16:20.920]  first of all it's not your industry

[16:33.400 --> 16:34.960]  your industry
[16:34.960 --> 16:38.480]  and even say that alex don't said kill michelle melkin is totally and
[16:38.480 --> 16:40.520]  completely incorrect
[16:40.520 --> 16:43.320]  and to call him a despicable soul
[16:43.320 --> 16:47.000]  you know he's trying to save your soul which i'm sure is as black as

[33:43.400 --> 33:49.640]  coverage for you guys probably in the second hour Alex is going to be calling in but we're
[33:49.640 --> 33:53.480]  going to be playing a couple of the trailers and some of the new trailers in a little bit
[33:53.480 --> 33:59.960]  of fabled enemies hopefully we can pull up pull up trailer two right now uh is really
[33:59.960 --> 34:05.160]  operatives and I did a morning show today and I was asked well what's different about
[34:05.160 --> 34:09.720]  this film than say a lot of the other 9-11 films out there and I said well number one
[34:10.440 --> 34:13.480]  we're not really looking at the physical anomalies here we don't bring up the pentagon
[34:13.480 --> 34:16.920]  we're not talking about shanksville we're not talking about controlled demolition
[34:16.920 --> 34:21.800]  unlike number two we really blow wide open the international intelligence organization
[34:22.600 --> 34:26.200]  that carried out the attacks from the israelis to the pakistanis to the saudis to the people
[34:26.200 --> 34:31.160]  within our own government and we also blow wide open that the shadow government doesn't
[34:31.160 --> 34:38.120]  indeed exist was in effect on 9-11 was put into place through drills and was in place long after
[34:38.120 --> 34:42.120]  9-11 so let's bring up the israeli operative chapter or uh trailer and play that
[34:42.120 --> 34:50.680]  fox news has learned that some american terrorism investigators fear certain suspects in the
[34:50.680 --> 34:56.440]  september 11 attacks may have managed to stay ahead of them some u.s investigators believe
[34:56.440 --> 35:02.360]  that there are israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the u.s whether it's because
[35:02.360 --> 35:07.400]  they're in intelligence services or what they were doing i will defer to the department of
[35:07.400 --> 35:12.600]  justice in the fbi that there was a report on the george washington bridge that there had been a van
[35:12.600 --> 35:25.160]  uh stopped there that had explosives and israeli based private telecommunications company
[35:26.040 --> 35:29.720]  it is virtually impossible to make a call on normal phones
[35:29.720 --> 35:34.200]  without generating an amdox record of it it quickly unraveled to be the largest
[35:34.200 --> 35:40.440]  force firing ever uncovered inside the united states the largest documents say they quote
[35:40.440 --> 35:47.080]  targeted and penetrated military bases the dea fbi and dozens of other government facilities
[35:47.080 --> 35:53.800]  is one big elephant in the living room is the relationship between the united states of america
[35:53.800 --> 35:59.400]  and the state of israel what about this question of advanced knowledge of what was going to happen
[35:59.400 --> 36:03.960]  on 9-11 well it's very explosive information obviously a bigger question they say is how
[36:03.960 --> 36:15.560]  could they not have no well there you go fabled enemies drops august 31st and uh i can't wait
[36:15.560 --> 36:21.320]  i know a lot of you people out there can't wait and uh i'm just totally excited to get it out there
[36:21.320 --> 36:27.880]  i'm so happy that alex jones gave me this opportunity to uh put this film out there
[36:27.880 --> 36:33.560]  to share it with the world and uh again i we hope that you get copies of it we hope you make
[36:33.560 --> 36:37.320]  copies we hope that you hold screenings in your house in your local church at your local
[36:37.320 --> 36:43.000]  community center put it on public access because a lot of people are still not aware
[36:43.880 --> 36:51.320]  that 9-11 was indeed an inside job with the help of other intelligent services because this is
[36:51.320 --> 36:55.960]  bigger than america this is about globalism folks i know a lot of you don't want to hear that i know
[36:55.960 --> 37:00.520]  a lot of you want to get stuck in this false left right paradigm where barack obama is for change
[37:00.520 --> 37:04.520]  and he's changed we can vote for and everything's going to turn around in the next four years
[37:04.520 --> 37:09.080]  because we're not going to have a republican in office but you see that's just not reality
[37:09.560 --> 37:17.080]  uh they they need that false system of hope for people they need people to say okay this
[37:17.080 --> 37:23.960]  guy's really going to help me out he's not going to help you out he's bad bad news and when i say
[37:23.960 --> 37:31.960]  he's bad bad news you better believe he's bad bad news you know i had colonel paul craig roberts on
[37:31.960 --> 37:38.680]  yesterday and he literally said we were on the brink of a nuclear armageddon now i wasn't really
[37:38.680 --> 37:43.720]  prepared for this or or him as a guest to say something like this i've had him on before
[37:44.440 --> 37:49.480]  he has a lot of good information he is clearly stuck in this left right paradigm
[37:49.480 --> 37:55.480]  having worked uh in the reagan administration with a lot of the quote unquote crazies if you will
[37:55.480 --> 38:01.080]  reama govern also coined the term that rumsfeld cheney that whole crew were known as the quote
[38:01.080 --> 38:07.320]  unquote crazies back in his day and i'd have to agree they are completely and totally insane
[38:07.320 --> 38:15.480]  out of their minds if you will and for some reason he said that we could be on the brink
[38:15.480 --> 38:20.360]  of a nuclear war with russia and this would not be a all of a sudden there's a tax and we regroup
[38:20.360 --> 38:26.920]  in this country and there's conscription and we're in a world war he said no they're gonna nuke us
[38:26.920 --> 38:30.520]  and it's not going to be one of these toy nukes they used in japan i'm like oh my god those are
[38:30.520 --> 38:35.400]  supposedly toy nukes now he's like oh yeah they let one off he's like i wouldn't be surprised if
[38:35.400 --> 38:41.720]  they went hit washington and that killed everybody from boston to atlanta can you imagine that
[38:41.720 --> 38:46.600]  you're wiping out one third of the united states population right there a hundred million people
[38:47.240 --> 38:52.120]  devastating i can't even think about it gives me chills just thinking about it i sure hope he's
[38:52.120 --> 38:58.040]  wrong but at the same time you know i listened to another interview he did later in the day and
[38:58.040 --> 39:04.360]  he said you know brzezinski was uh not a madman and that he would rather see brzezinski in charge
[39:04.360 --> 39:15.880]  and just totally and completely off base that uh it it drives me up a wall to even think that
[39:17.160 --> 39:26.120]  well anybody could fall for this stuff anymore that people people think there's a difference
[39:26.120 --> 39:31.720]  well there's there's not a difference okay there's just not a difference at all i mean
[39:31.720 --> 39:37.560]  there's a little bit difference of ideology of course the people at the top are simply uh
[39:39.320 --> 39:45.720]  doing their best if you will to gain more power you know they're not really friends with each
[39:45.720 --> 39:52.920]  other they stab each other in the back constantly but their goal is the same their goal is globalism
[39:52.920 --> 40:04.280]  their goal is to have a one-world government their goal is basically to take away our freedom
[40:05.000 --> 40:12.520]  to build a north american union to build the european union up even farther to build the
[40:12.520 --> 40:19.640]  pan american union up even farther and eventually have a united nations type body rule over all of us
[40:19.640 --> 40:26.520]  where we're chipped and controlled and we pay a carbon tax on our homes and how much gas we use
[40:26.520 --> 40:31.560]  and how many cars we have and how many children we have and it'll be all very eco friendly
[40:33.960 --> 40:38.360]  they'll fear monger with their global warming and a lot of people are going to buy into it
[40:39.240 --> 40:46.600]  it's very sad i do not want to pay a global tax based on the energy i used i think it's
[40:46.600 --> 40:53.400]  absolutely ludicrous i think it's appalling i think it's disgusting but al gore is going to
[40:53.400 --> 40:59.400]  talk tonight at the dnc and don't think he won't fear monger with his uh his global warming fiasco
[40:59.400 --> 41:05.400]  movie there uh even though thousands of scientists have come out saying it's a total incomplete hopes
[41:05.400 --> 41:10.200]  they don't want to be associated with it i mean there was they were pumping global cooling
[41:10.200 --> 41:15.480]  30 40 years ago and then they decided to lie to my generation well i sat in class and i
[41:15.480 --> 41:21.640]  looked up at the television set and they were playing you know ted dancin and whoopee golberg
[41:21.640 --> 41:26.920]  and vinnie dalpino from doogie howser telling me how by 2020 we're all going to be in radiation
[41:26.920 --> 41:33.400]  suits and you know that the air wouldn't be fit to breathe and we needed to do something about it
[41:33.400 --> 41:38.680]  and i'm just like oh my god the oceans are going to rise and people are going to die and we're just
[41:38.680 --> 41:43.080]  polluting the planet what's wrong with us we're so bad and now they've offered us the solution
[41:43.080 --> 41:47.800]  without actually offering it to us they've just started to put artificial clouds in the skies
[41:47.800 --> 41:53.400]  comp trails cam trails whatever you want to call me had the leader in that i wouldn't say leader but
[41:53.400 --> 41:58.760]  i'd say the foremost expert in that on yesterday and uh if you missed the show you can get the
[41:58.760 --> 42:04.600]  podcast over info wars dot com for free and she's very careful on what she calls it because there
[42:04.600 --> 42:13.160]  are so many public so many public okay let me say it again so many public programs let me say it again
[42:13.160 --> 42:21.640]  so many public programs for weather modification just all over the place and uh i think she's very
[42:21.640 --> 42:25.640]  very smart in her approach but anyway getting back to how they're offering us this solution they're
[42:25.640 --> 42:29.080]  not really offering it to us they're putting fake clouds in the sky and then they're putting out
[42:29.080 --> 42:33.720]  press releases through nasa saying that it's to combat global warming so that when more people
[42:33.720 --> 42:37.960]  get hip to it and start asking questions about it they'll immediately be told well we're supposed
[42:37.960 --> 42:41.880]  to keep it pretty quiet but it's for your safety we're combating global warming we're trying to
[42:41.880 --> 42:47.640]  save the planet no in fact they're poisoning us and uh they're trying to reduce our population i
[42:47.640 --> 42:53.000]  know that's very hard for some of you to believe in except but cancer has shot through the roof in
[42:53.000 --> 42:56.920]  the last 20 years autism has shot through the roof in the last 20 years people are dying from other
[42:56.920 --> 43:02.200]  sicknesses because their immune system just can't handle it and it's coming here it's coming here
[43:02.200 --> 43:09.480]  it's not just in third world nations can you imagine a population reduction of 100 million
[43:09.480 --> 43:15.640]  in this country from nuclear war otherwise i can't we would be a shell of our former selves it's
[43:15.640 --> 43:19.960]  very very frightening to me that people are even talking about this that people think that this could
[43:19.960 --> 43:28.600]  be on the table that people believe that uh we could be going into this man if frustrates me to
[43:28.600 --> 43:35.720]  no end and it makes me very very wary of not only what i report but how i live and who i you know
[43:35.720 --> 43:40.440]  associate with and who i can relate to i mean obviously i don't want this to happen to me
[43:40.440 --> 43:46.760]  or my family i don't want it to happen to you i don't want to happen to my friends i don't want
[43:46.760 --> 43:55.720]  it to happen i want sensible heads to prevail but when you have putin going on cnn and this is the
[43:55.720 --> 44:05.160]  headline putin accuses us of orchestrating georgian war accuses us um they're the ones that attack
[44:05.160 --> 44:08.600]  and they admit it right in the very beginning and they say there's no evidence to back it up but
[44:08.600 --> 44:12.760]  let's read it russian prime minister vladimir putin has accused the united states of orchestrating
[44:12.760 --> 44:18.360]  the conflict in georgia to benefit one of its presidential election candidates in an exclusive
[44:18.360 --> 44:23.880]  interview with cnn's matthew chance in the black sea city of associate uh thursday putin said that
[44:23.880 --> 44:29.160]  us had encouraged georgia to attack the autonomous region of south oceania yes they did they brought
[44:29.160 --> 44:34.200]  in us special forces they brought in israeli special forces they were running drills absolutely
[44:34.200 --> 44:38.840]  encouraged them to go attack them putin told cnn his defense officials told him that it was done
[44:38.840 --> 44:43.800]  to benefit a presidential candidate republican john mccain and democrat barack obama are competing
[44:43.800 --> 44:50.760]  to succeed george w bush although he presented no evidence to back it up when told that many
[44:50.760 --> 44:55.080]  diplomats in the united states and europe blame russia for provoking the conflict and for invading
[44:55.080 --> 45:01.080]  georgia putin said russia had no choice but to invade georgia after dozens of its peacekeepers
[45:01.080 --> 45:08.600]  in south oceania were killed he told chance was an ever human calamity yeah yeah it wasn't ever
[45:08.600 --> 45:13.560]  to human calamity they stopped the ethnic cleansing there maybe we'll pull up that 12-year-old girl
[45:13.560 --> 45:17.640]  clip where she clearly says that south oceania was attacked by georgian troops russian troops
[45:17.640 --> 45:21.960]  helped her get out and back to this country how dare she say that on fox news she immediately
[45:21.960 --> 45:25.480]  got cut off and they said they had to go to a break shepard smith just didn't know what to do
[45:26.760 --> 45:30.520]  then you got suckers veily running around talking about how he's pro new world order
[45:30.520 --> 45:35.320]  and how this is about the future of the new world order and the european era and europe in general
[45:35.320 --> 45:39.080]  i mean he's just a dude that wants to get into nato that's part of this globalist scheme
[45:39.960 --> 45:44.680]  that wants more power more power they always want more power
[45:44.680 --> 45:50.120]  where because we're a slave class you know they want to rule over us they want to treat us like
[45:50.120 --> 45:53.560]  dirt they want to treat us like filth they want to treat us like we're low-level morons
[45:54.760 --> 45:59.320]  and sockers veily is a great speaker he talks about our wellianism he talks about double speak
[45:59.320 --> 46:04.120]  he talks about russia being the great aggressor and how it's peaceful and democratic in georgia
[46:04.120 --> 46:09.960]  know you're our puppet state we put you together that's not fooling anybody but it's not fooling
[46:09.960 --> 46:17.560]  my audience it's fooling a lot of other people i watch pat you can and yesterday talking about
[46:17.560 --> 46:23.800]  what an exciting election and race this has been and i'm thinking to myself you can and no it hasn't
[46:23.800 --> 46:27.560]  it hasn't been exciting you know he's talking about the back and forth between hillary and obama
[46:27.560 --> 46:32.280]  i'm like i don't care man why don't you talk about that article you wrote where you clearly state
[46:32.280 --> 46:37.320]  that georgia was the aggressor that russia just went in there to stop the ethnic cleansing why
[46:37.320 --> 46:40.440]  do you talk about that pat that's what i want to hear on the mainstream news i mean you're on it
[46:40.440 --> 46:46.040]  enough you're on msnbc enough to say something but i'm sure he's under contract and he's not
[46:46.040 --> 46:51.640]  allowed to discuss it it's a sad sad world when even those who are kind of in the main line when
[46:51.640 --> 46:56.920]  they put out something that's truthful and honest they feel pressure not to speak about it on television
[46:58.440 --> 47:01.720]  it's ludicrous your sport the media is there
[47:01.720 --> 47:09.400]  there supposedly to protect us from corporations from government but now they're owned by the
[47:09.400 --> 47:13.080]  corporations in the government which are really one of the same because they're owned by the same
[47:13.080 --> 47:18.840]  special interests and that military industrial complex that ison harrow warned us warned us
[47:18.840 --> 47:25.160]  about so many years ago has finally come to fruition on a new level on a level where they
[47:25.160 --> 47:29.240]  can buy up the media where they can broadcast whatever they want on the main networks where
[47:29.240 --> 47:34.520]  they can create subnetworks to broadcast whatever they want where they can do so so overtly that
[47:34.520 --> 47:39.320]  they can literally have a channel called the military channel it's not enough that they're
[47:39.320 --> 47:43.000]  pumping propaganda through the history channel or the learning channel or the discovery channel
[47:43.880 --> 47:47.000]  now they're gonna have their own network well they've had their own network for some time i
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.400]  watch the military channel you watch things like future weapons and you're just you can't believe
[47:51.400 --> 47:55.160]  it you start telling your friends about these future weapons unless they actually saw the
[47:55.160 --> 48:00.600]  show they can't believe it either like i actually had somebody emailing me uh the other day asking
[48:00.600 --> 48:05.960]  me where the proof was for microwave weapons and i'm like are you serious just type it into cnn man
[48:06.840 --> 48:11.240]  they literally put the soldiers out in an open field they mount the thing on a van or a truck
[48:11.240 --> 48:16.120]  or a piece of military equipment and they flip it on all of a sudden everybody feels like they're
[48:16.120 --> 48:22.680]  on fire and they literally start running they just run away i'm sure it's extremely uncomfortable
[48:22.680 --> 48:27.880]  to get hit with those kind of radio waves i would probably more than extremely uncomfortable
[48:27.880 --> 48:32.200]  but they do exist they use them on protesters they use them to squelch descent they're uh
[48:32.200 --> 48:39.960]  at the dnc right now and uh they exist it's like saying you know the sky is blue and the sun comes
[48:39.960 --> 48:44.600]  up in the morning that microwave weapons exist but there will still be people who email me after
[48:44.600 --> 48:50.680]  the show and say jason microwave weapons don't exist come on stop it sound weapons don't exist
[48:50.680 --> 48:55.560]  they never use them against the american populace anyway why are you why are you uh causing all
[48:55.560 --> 49:01.240]  this alarm well this is why i'm causing the alarm we have a second amendment for a reason
[49:01.240 --> 49:08.040]  our second amendment is there so that we can defend ourselves if we're attacked now these weapons
[49:08.040 --> 49:15.480]  have gotten to a place where say swat wants to come into my house they're they're rounding people
[49:15.480 --> 49:20.600]  up for whatever reason and they don't just have guns they don't just have tanks they are able
[49:20.600 --> 49:27.320]  to disarm me very easily by pointing a sound weapon at my home and hitting me with it and i'm just
[49:27.320 --> 49:30.920]  going to go running for the hills probably out the back door running away from the sound wave
[49:30.920 --> 49:34.920]  as quickly as possible i'm not going to be able to hold a gun i'm not going to be able to pull
[49:34.920 --> 49:41.160]  a trigger not going to be able to set up or defend myself but these are the weapons that are quote
[49:41.160 --> 49:46.280]  unquote government has and they'll be privately contracted out to people like blackwater and other
[49:46.280 --> 49:54.040]  terrible terrible mercenary agencies that are out there again on behalf of the corporate interests
[49:54.040 --> 50:00.600]  on behalf of people like halibur or cheney and halibur in and on behalf of you know people
[50:00.600 --> 50:05.160]  like blair in the background on behalf of all these people moving out to debaille
[50:06.600 --> 50:12.120]  for the little luxury vacations these multi-billionaires that just don't really care about you or me
[50:12.120 --> 50:15.640]  that love to rip off the american people that love to consolidate their power
[50:15.640 --> 50:20.040]  that love to foreclose on the housing market take the money from the bank those people
[50:20.040 --> 50:26.440]  those really really nice loving people that parade around as our saviors and act like they're doing
[50:26.440 --> 50:30.040]  us a favor every time they're on the television saying how much they're going to give to us and
[50:30.040 --> 50:33.960]  how much better things going to be when we put them in office but that's not how it works things
[50:33.960 --> 50:37.320]  ain't going to change for the better when when barack obama's in office in fact they're probably
[50:37.320 --> 50:41.640]  going to change for the worse and a lot of people won't realize it because they'll be so mesmerized

[1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:31.320]  sitting in for alex all week while he's at the dnc and i gotta tell you
[1:00:32.040 --> 1:00:34.920]  draught nader gave a really riveting speech last night
[1:00:34.920 --> 1:00:43.640]  he gave a little too much credit to the democrats i think but he clearly said that they're both
[1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:48.520]  owned by the corporations he talked about a social movement how easy it would be
[1:00:48.520 --> 1:00:54.520]  for us young people to do so and he also talked about how much energy us young people have and
[1:00:54.520 --> 1:00:59.960]  how you don't get that later on in life and if they only knew how to harness that energy
[1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:05.000]  and start a movement it would be very very simple and i agree with them i'm with them 110 percent
[1:01:06.360 --> 1:01:12.040]  there are so many opportunities for young people like myself and those out here out there listening
[1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:17.720]  to get involved
[1:01:22.600 --> 1:01:25.640]  and you can do that simply by starting
[1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:27.640]  a video
[1:01:29.320 --> 1:01:36.840]  by going and sharing videos with your neighbors might be making a video by doing small youtube
[1:01:36.840 --> 1:01:43.400]  videos you know and nothing's stopping the average person from making these uh these movies
[1:01:43.400 --> 1:01:49.400]  i'm not gonna lie this last one uh cost about 20 gs to me it was quite a quite a bit of money
[1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:54.280]  but the only reason it cost that much is because well i needed a a new mac work station that's
[1:01:54.280 --> 1:01:59.000]  about four grand and then uh you know i had to have some kind of transportation out here
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  and so that cost me actually the majority of my money and then i have to live out here and
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:07.960]  then alex has to pay his editors uh the fine editors here who you know wear many hats like
[1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:14.760]  erin dykes and rob jacobson who are out there in the dnc with them and it's pretty cheap i mean
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:19.960]  obviously my film has a little bit more production value than some of the other ones out there but
[1:02:19.960 --> 1:02:25.880]  if you're creative if you went to school for digital video editing much like myself you
[1:02:25.880 --> 1:02:29.720]  can do this you can do it with you know windows movie maker if you like if you're slick enough
[1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:34.600]  you can do it with the adobe sweets i mean obviously i'm a final cut pro man now but
[1:02:35.240 --> 1:02:39.800]  you have great power first study the issue then decide what you want to do maybe you want to
[1:02:39.800 --> 1:02:45.640]  write a book you know i haven't seen a really great youth book out there in a while i mean some of
[1:02:45.640 --> 1:02:50.920]  the great books that have come out in my opinion are obviously uh ron paul's revolution a manifesto
[1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:55.560]  you know that's just incredible to me that that was able to get number one on the new york times
[1:02:55.560 --> 1:03:01.800]  bestseller list uh jesse ventura don't start the revolution without me and now coursey with this
[1:03:01.800 --> 1:03:07.480]  blockbuster obama nation that's not to say that i don't enjoy tex marz work too because i was pretty
[1:03:07.480 --> 1:03:12.840]  interested in mysterious monuments and of course his previous work uh codex magica uh the majority
[1:03:12.840 --> 1:03:18.680]  of what i just said is listed uh you can go get those right now at info wars dot com but really it
[1:03:18.680 --> 1:03:24.200]  comes down to have you decided that you want to make a difference have you decided you've had enough
[1:03:24.200 --> 1:03:31.160]  have you decided that wait a minute i can affect change because we're told every day oh you can't
[1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:35.800]  do anything about it that's just the way it is you ain't going to do nothing what am i going to do
[1:03:35.800 --> 1:03:43.080]  about it how about being adult how about grow up i know that we're trained to suckle out the teat
[1:03:43.080 --> 1:03:48.920]  of government until we're you know 35 40 years old a lot of us don't get out of our parents house
[1:03:48.920 --> 1:03:54.600]  until we're 30 years old now kind of disgusting if you ask me i mean you go to college for four to
[1:03:54.600 --> 1:04:00.280]  six to eight years depending on how slovingly you are and how motivated you are and how much you
[1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:03.960]  know what you want to do or you just want to be a professional student and then a lot of these guys
[1:04:03.960 --> 1:04:10.440]  just go right back and live at home you know back to their old bedroom until they're 29 30 and they
[1:04:10.440 --> 1:04:14.520]  got a job from their dad or their uncle and they worked their way up and now they finally got their
[1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:19.720]  own little apartment they can barely take care of themselves you're a grown man move out of your
[1:04:19.720 --> 1:04:26.280]  parents house for god's sake i i i just don't see you being able to do really anything until you're
[1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:30.600]  able to take care of yourself that's why a lot of these bloggers and commenters and trolls really
[1:04:30.600 --> 1:04:35.160]  bother me because you know they're in the the basement of their grandmother's house and they're
[1:04:35.160 --> 1:04:42.360]  on their futon just no idea what's going on in the world well i'll tell you what's going on in the

[1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:37.240]  but nator really stepped up and said you know what you want to start a social movement young
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:42.440]  people put down the iPods it's not going to be easy but you could make it easy by making an
[1:08:42.440 --> 1:08:50.040]  issue to turn on the politics and uh i agree i i agree that if you don't turn on the politics
[1:08:50.040 --> 1:08:54.520]  politics will indeed turn on you and uh if you allow that to happen which we have
[1:08:54.520 --> 1:08:58.280]  you're going to wind up in wars in the middle east you're going to wind up
[1:08:59.480 --> 1:09:03.960]  with a devaluing dollar you're going to wind up with your house being foreclosed on you're
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:10.440]  going to wind up with your bank taking your money and just saying bye bye no money for you
[1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:14.920]  and then you're going to end up with a pile of money that's actually worthless if you were
[1:09:14.920 --> 1:09:21.400]  smart enough to get your money out of the bank sounds terrible but it's true
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:28.280]  you don't doubt me indy mac and san diego gone lots of people losing their homes right now
[1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:34.040]  in the next two years so many more are going to lose their homes you sign on to an idiotic loan
[1:09:34.040 --> 1:09:37.320]  folks you don't read the fine print you don't know what kind of interest you're paying you don't
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:42.680]  know how the interest can change at any moment you almost deserve what you get but i i don't
[1:09:42.680 --> 1:09:48.520]  believe that you know a lot of these people they work 40 60 80 hours a week some of our two families
[1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:54.680]  we're talking between the two 120 hours a week barely scraping by and they don't have time in
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:09:59.880]  their eyes to care about the issues they just want to care what the tv tells them that's why i make
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:04.040]  movies because they get to watch their tv for an hour and a half in two hours and maybe it
[1:10:04.040 --> 1:10:10.200]  motivates them to stop watching like the propaganda to start copying my film to start saying to their
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:16.520]  neighbor hey you know that 9 11 there's a lot of unanswered questions huh that nist report that
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:21.480]  just came out that doesn't make a whole lot of sense does it all right we do have alex jones
[1:10:21.480 --> 1:10:29.160]  with us live from the dnc over at the free speech zones alex hey jason uh... my coming in loud and
[1:10:29.160 --> 1:10:35.160]  clear to you yes very clear well first off we need the audience's help on several things
[1:10:35.160 --> 1:10:39.560]  i'll give everybody a report on what's happened in the last 24 hours here at the dnc in denver
[1:10:39.560 --> 1:10:46.280]  it's all very interesting very important first off we need everybody's help though um the delas
[1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:55.400]  morning news writer mark davis who is a neocon talk show host he has done what uh none of the
[1:10:55.400 --> 1:11:03.160]  mainstream media did in the last uh two days the first day they did and reported that i had said
[1:11:03.160 --> 1:11:08.600]  kill michelle malcon but after they were uh had a chance to see the different video angles
[1:11:08.600 --> 1:11:14.840]  and then it was her supporters behind me uh yelling kill michelle malcon there been some
[1:11:14.840 --> 1:11:20.680]  retractions and even some of the neocon blogs have to admit okay other people were yelling
[1:11:20.680 --> 1:11:25.160]  kill michelle malcon but they were with alex jones so they're still putting out that this
[1:11:25.160 --> 1:11:30.760]  info but the delas morning news of mark davis delas morning news uh he is in the top 10 papers
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:37.080]  if it's listed by many services by the night they're 10th largest paper in the united states
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:42.600]  it's the number one paper in oklahoma texas uh and surrounding areas it's the big regional
[1:11:42.600 --> 1:11:50.840]  paper owned by billow broadcasting the billow family and he just he says i'm discredited i'm
[1:11:50.840 --> 1:11:59.080]  evil i'm bad you know all these horrible names it is the definition of defamation of libel
[1:11:59.080 --> 1:12:04.360]  because he's saying i want to discredit alex jones he says in there this discredits alex jones so
[1:12:04.360 --> 1:12:11.960]  he's stating a lie a slander a libel defamation and then adding to it that he means to hurt me
[1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:19.320]  with the information um now there's a couple video angles out there where you see me talking you
[1:12:19.320 --> 1:12:25.400]  can hear me talking to malcon who's getting in my face i've been in her face she's getting in my face
[1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:29.880]  and the guys are leaning over me screaming and you can clearly see that i'm talking you can hear
[1:12:29.880 --> 1:12:35.480]  me talking loud but not screaming at that time and they're screaming over me kill michelle malcon
[1:12:35.480 --> 1:12:42.120]  kill michelle malcon they're chanting in unison and they were with malcon we know that now were
[1:12:42.120 --> 1:12:45.960]  they working for her does she really even know them no there were a couple local neocon blogs
[1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:51.640]  and they had the nationals at the jama's blog that she post and cross promotes and you know
[1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:57.400]  they write for each other he was there he was the bearded nanny who was bumping into me
[1:12:59.960 --> 1:13:03.560]  and it was another guy with a mustache running around i mean this is important because
[1:13:03.560 --> 1:13:08.360]  they're trying to demonize all of us and we have her people then going over and saying
[1:13:08.360 --> 1:13:12.600]  he's saying kill michelle malcon and then laughing about it when they know that they were the ones
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:19.400]  doing it now that's all documented on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com some of my detractors
[1:13:19.400 --> 1:13:24.680]  in the quote patriot truth movement are seizing on this thinking oh alex jones is being criticized
[1:13:24.680 --> 1:13:30.280]  yes he deserves it he's bad the alex jones well rumors about demise have been greatly exaggerated
[1:13:30.280 --> 1:13:37.080]  as mark plant said no this is good for info wars dot com in a sick way and prison planet dot com

[1:13:48.360 --> 1:13:53.560]  get that straight you failed again both government minions my haters my stalkers all of you
[1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:59.480]  the neocon followers but it does hurt the 911 truth movement either able to get this hoax
[1:13:59.480 --> 1:14:05.320]  through but i have to say the hoax he has failed national media i'd say about 80 percent of them
[1:14:05.320 --> 1:14:10.040]  now are having to admit that i did not say kill her and that it was all distorted people are

[1:25:29.960 --> 1:25:36.920]  i am folks i am just absolutely sick of all of this but anyways it's just the way these people
[1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:41.160]  operated to know that for decades they've been getting away with this in the mainstream media
[1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:45.720]  but now because the alternative media has gotten so big they're still playing a 10 20 30 year old
[1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:50.440]  game uh in a new era and that's why we're kicking their butt thanks to you the listeners but

[1:36:04.920 --> 1:36:10.200]  new when you say you heard it i've got it alkan and then malcon met she admitted on john gibson
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:14.600]  show i hadn't thought of this she admitted on john gibson that i didn't say killer and that was two
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:21.320]  days ago on his radio show on fox radio of the fox new center in new york and you're saying she
[1:36:21.320 --> 1:36:26.200]  admitted in the pajama's bass piece so once you find that clip later neck down and play it you said
[1:36:26.200 --> 1:36:31.320]  you could i've got a cute actually okay well that's what we need to send we need to get that up on the
[1:36:31.320 --> 1:36:36.520]  web in a story and send it to the dallas morning news and say here is the person saying i didn't do
[1:36:36.520 --> 1:36:41.800]  it now retract now don't make me defend my name this is their assaulting me with a lie saying i
[1:36:41.800 --> 1:36:47.400]  said kill a woman they are attacking my name and patriots name and i want to say they're punching
[1:36:47.400 --> 1:36:55.400]  us uh with this with this libelous attack and so i'm just saying stop assaulting me retract your
[1:36:55.400 --> 1:37:00.360]  assault and i won't sue you but if they don't god i don't want to do this because if i do i
[1:37:00.360 --> 1:37:04.600]  just i don't want to do it i don't have the time the energy i ignore so much other libel and slander
[1:37:04.600 --> 1:37:11.240]  by crackpots and nuts but this is the dallas morning news and so this is a very serious libel it's
[1:37:11.240 --> 1:37:15.480]  very dangerous to my family we're getting threats in well if we were going to get you for threatening
[1:37:15.480 --> 1:37:19.800]  then saying to kill that woman there's a lot of nuts out there so we need to play that pajama's
[1:37:19.800 --> 1:37:27.000]  media clip pointed out on their own side and say look retract now retract individually mark
[1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:33.400]  davis the writer that did this uh and dallas morning news separately you know they better
[1:37:33.400 --> 1:37:37.800]  do it and they better do it now this is wrong they've assaulted me with a major newspaper they've
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:43.480]  bullied the american people they've lied they've engaged in a libelous defamation of myself and
[1:37:43.480 --> 1:37:50.200]  others and so play that clip also play the inside edition i know that's coming up and um
[1:37:50.840 --> 1:37:55.480]  we're gonna have more live feeds for you today more interview for you today uh there's it's really
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:37:59.960]  frustrating me to get the course the interview and then it didn't archived and was erased
[1:38:00.680 --> 1:38:05.880]  uh it's very frustrating to you know be with shamp in and and and the guy playing the
[1:38:06.600 --> 1:38:11.880]  bush in the new w movie josh brolin and then then they have that going to some black hole
[1:38:12.760 --> 1:38:18.840]  it's very very frustrating uh but but again this is new technology and it's what it helped us show
[1:38:18.840 --> 1:38:24.360]  michelle malkin's people uh live and that's what helped us get ahead of their propaganda and we
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:29.080]  really kicked their butt i mean we're turning the tide here we want about 70 of the battle here
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:33.720]  if we get a retraction again in the dallas morning news that will then silence and fully discredit
[1:38:33.720 --> 1:38:41.960]  all these people that slandered us who libeled us so that is so important uh on that front and like i
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:47.800]  said we may go ahead and put the regime machine interview up tonight we do have the hard wire
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:55.960]  cameras with the great 15 minute interview with corsie um yeah i mean there's just so much more
[1:38:55.960 --> 1:39:01.080]  we've got it just goes on and on and on all the amazing things we have uh but what i'm trying to
[1:39:01.080 --> 1:39:05.960]  figure out how to we try to compress hd and go through all that it would take hours and hours
[1:39:05.960 --> 1:39:09.720]  probably five six hours just to put one clip up that's the problem with high quality cameras
[1:39:09.720 --> 1:39:17.320]  but with the cruddy live streaming uh it's instant it's all just done so we're gonna try later
[1:39:17.320 --> 1:39:23.960]  whenever we get a chance to stream the right against the machine deal over justin tv and the
[1:39:23.960 --> 1:39:36.520]  corsie and uh some of the quick stuff with brolin and then uh john penn so that's all coming up
[1:39:36.520 --> 1:39:41.400]  today if not it'll just be when i get home friday night uh you know we'll do it next week if we
[1:39:41.400 --> 1:39:46.040]  gotta rest um that's why we need funds folks it's why we need the money bomb is important
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:50.200]  the tv show we're setting up it's important the funds the funds to harm more people to have more
[1:39:50.200 --> 1:39:55.160]  webmasters to have more id people we're all overstretched and my whole team is you know really
[1:39:55.160 --> 1:39:59.000]  busting their hind ends and we're not complaining we love what we're doing we have passion it's just
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:03.080]  that i you know really have been cracking the whip and just appreciate all the guys and everything
[1:40:04.040 --> 1:40:07.640]  they've done and if i forgot anybody else there at the office i just i just want to thank all of
[1:40:07.640 --> 1:40:13.800]  them i want to thank the gcn radio network and just the things that the slander the live
[1:40:13.800 --> 1:40:18.200]  the genesis has gone through from the mainstream media alternative media the jealous alternative
[1:40:18.200 --> 1:40:23.480]  media look man all you can do the same thing we're doing get on a plane get an rv come to
[1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:28.520]  Denver do the same things we do i mean we support you we want to interview you we we've been nothing
[1:40:28.520 --> 1:40:33.320]  but nice to everybody and it always freaks me out that as we get bigger and bigger and we're
[1:40:33.320 --> 1:40:38.360]  growing exponentially i got news people you can't stop us now no matter how hard you try you can't
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:44.680]  stop us now as a radio machine says and i'm just telling i feel sorry for it we should come in join
[1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:51.000]  the team be positive we're aware of the blackmail activities of some locals we're aware of them wanting
[1:40:51.000 --> 1:40:55.960]  to you know run other scams and we're not stupid folks we have sources that you don't uh and so
[1:40:55.960 --> 1:41:00.760]  to understand we know what's going on and i just felt you can't imagine the attacks the level of
[1:41:00.760 --> 1:41:05.560]  attacks the angles of attacks stuff you wouldn't believe if i told you it's just too damaging
[1:41:05.560 --> 1:41:11.160]  to this movement for me to bring it out but i may i'm considering so uh i just can't hold back
[1:41:11.160 --> 1:41:19.000]  anymore folks i can't allow my friends my family my colleagues uh you know um i don't like having
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:23.720]  to ostracize people away from me but i just had to do it with some of the locals because they're
[1:41:23.720 --> 1:41:28.600]  just so dangerous and so bad i mean a true evil i mean to come to grips with it's not just a new
[1:41:28.600 --> 1:41:35.480]  old order it's the public we are a degenerate society falling apart the just totally degenerating
[1:41:35.480 --> 1:41:39.320]  but there's good people too the good people are waking up alternative media is exploding
[1:41:39.320 --> 1:41:42.680]  and that's why we have a lot of bad people trying to move into the middle of it and screw it up
[1:41:42.680 --> 1:41:47.480]  we've all got to work together and move forward and all my enemies i mean you know you've all
[1:41:47.480 --> 1:41:52.760]  failed miserably you will fail miserably do not poke the bear anymore and the same goes
[1:41:52.760 --> 1:41:56.840]  the Dallas morning news michelle malkin all of them you know the gloves are off we're not playing
[1:41:56.840 --> 1:42:02.360]  games we're up in our game we're going all out in the battle for the republic and we are dedicated
[1:42:02.360 --> 1:42:06.120]  and committed and everything people throw against us just we turn right back against them and it only
[1:42:06.120 --> 1:42:09.960]  makes us stronger and all the glory goes to my lord and savior jesus christ and i asked god to
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:14.840]  put a head to protection up again around jason bermas around my entire crew around all of our
[1:42:14.840 --> 1:42:19.720]  colleagues and affiliates and allies and my and our folks here in denver and my dad was trying to

[1:42:28.200 --> 1:42:33.080]  sides and let's just don't talk a lot about it but the point is we're here we just ask for god's

[1:43:08.360 --> 1:43:13.160]  program and i just love what you guys do out there i mean i'm just so excited to be a part of this
[1:43:13.160 --> 1:43:17.400]  revolutionary alternative media which is breaking through to the mainstream and doing much more
[1:43:17.400 --> 1:43:21.000]  than the mainstream could ever hope to do in telling the truth to the american well that's
[1:43:21.000 --> 1:43:24.600]  another point in closing there's so many points i forget to make it while i'm on the street i want
[1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:29.480]  to call in and make them and they never do think about how ineffectual the protesters are the five
[1:43:29.480 --> 1:43:34.040]  or six groups how they get almost no attention or the media focuses on the bad guys and think about
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:39.160]  how the real alternative media how we're taking it over how we're how we're exposing them how we're
[1:43:39.160 --> 1:43:46.280]  discrediting them how effective we have gotten i mean it is just so exciting to be part of this
[1:43:46.280 --> 1:43:51.400]  and to see how lean and mean we are in the info or thanks to our listeners you are the power you
[1:43:51.400 --> 1:43:55.960]  are the people turning it loose well jason i'll talk to you soon happy trails be careful all right
[1:43:55.960 --> 1:44:01.560]  thanks god bless alex all right folks with alex leaving us i think it's about time to play the
[1:44:01.560 --> 1:44:08.360]  inside edition clip that we have all right let me let me queue up the old laptop and let me hit
[1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:10.680]  play uh...
[1:44:10.680 --> 1:44:16.120]  at the convention as political commentator
[1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:22.360]  oh no she didn't do a whole lot to step away at the convention as political commentator
[1:44:22.360 --> 1:44:27.720]  michelle malkin is verbally attacked outside the arena and it was all caught on tape
[1:44:28.680 --> 1:44:31.320]  your soul is lost your evil
[1:44:31.320 --> 1:44:34.200]  a hateful confrontation at the democratic national convention
[1:44:34.200 --> 1:44:37.560]  joseph dirty anti-american definitely the free speech
[1:44:37.560 --> 1:44:42.040]  shame on you coming out here the object of that verbal bashing was conservative columnist
[1:44:42.040 --> 1:44:47.400]  michelle malkin who was covering a protest for fox news when controversial radio personality
[1:44:47.400 --> 1:44:51.880]  alex jones went on the attack jones's people videotaped the encounter
[1:44:51.880 --> 1:44:58.120]  you little monster you little fascist piece of trash i spoke to jones today in denver it's our
[1:44:58.120 --> 1:45:02.840]  right to go up and confront her about the despicable things she's written and said she has her first
[1:45:02.840 --> 1:45:08.680]  amendment we have ours jones believes 9-11 was the result of a u.s. government conspiracy
[1:45:08.680 --> 1:45:14.200]  malkin has condemned such theories as nutty and unfounded majority of victims families know 9-11's
[1:45:14.200 --> 1:45:20.040]  an inside job michelle malkin had this to say on her blog 9-11 nutball alex jones started barking
[1:45:20.040 --> 1:45:25.720]  at me and attempting to make a scene an insider riot i should have brought my spit shield if
[1:45:25.720 --> 1:45:30.120]  you get all fired up and you're a big guy and you're out there you're saying that uh she's a fascist
[1:45:30.120 --> 1:45:34.760]  piece of trash it's right she's a fascist piece of trash you're calling her a monster she is a monster
[1:45:34.760 --> 1:45:38.840]  have to understand that you can rile up a crowd yelling that stuff to this woman on the street
[1:45:38.840 --> 1:45:44.840]  well sure absolutely this woman needed to be confronted later in the broadcast
[1:45:47.720 --> 1:45:51.560]  there you go folks i wish that we didn't have all that feedback from the laptop but unfortunately
[1:45:51.560 --> 1:45:55.640]  it's not on youtube yet we hope some of the great listeners had taped it and also put it on youtube
[1:45:55.640 --> 1:45:59.240]  for later and like i said i really hope that people get to check out that course the interview
[1:45:59.240 --> 1:46:03.880]  before the week ends up and i myself i'm very excited to see the tom morello interview being
[1:46:03.880 --> 1:46:11.640]  a huge fan of his work now i am going to queue up the clip of pajama's media now i'm not sure if
[1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:15.960]  this part has malkin in it or not but she's on the line she's their guest you know they're all
[1:46:15.960 --> 1:46:22.840]  rubbing each other's backs it's it's quite uh disgusting and uh they admit right here the
[1:46:22.840 --> 1:46:28.440]  one guy tries to say oh you know tries to equate alex jones with these people that you know we're
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:34.040]  calling for violence and blah blah blah but the one guy has to fess up right away and say all right
[1:46:34.040 --> 1:46:39.240]  i can speak to that they weren't with alex jones so that being said let's play the clip
[1:46:43.320 --> 1:46:47.720]  michelle what did you make of jones referencing your defensive internment book from 2004
[1:46:48.280 --> 1:46:55.960]  well like 99.9 percent of the um people who criticize the book um so reciprocally um who
[1:46:55.960 --> 1:47:01.480]  off the bat um had characterized what my actual thesis and arguments are he has a
[1:47:01.480 --> 1:47:07.320]  poisonous element in uh public discourse do you have any plans to update your 2005 book michelle
[1:47:07.320 --> 1:47:15.400]  called unhinged because it's bring about a violent confrontation that he could then use to uh publicize
[1:47:15.400 --> 1:47:26.040]  the show and um and you know he was he was brave enough about it as long as it was him in his
[1:47:26.040 --> 1:47:36.680]  entire mob confronting one small person there was no mob okay it was him um he didn't particularly
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:49.080]  seem to like it that somebody was in the way and he did his best to incite more uh trouble now it's
[1:47:49.080 --> 1:47:55.400]  not absolutely clear to me if the guy that was yelling kill michelle malkin was one of his people
[1:47:55.400 --> 1:48:01.720]  are not it seems plausible it wasn't i can speak to that actually andrew marcus go ahead we we've
[1:48:01.720 --> 1:48:05.800]  looked at every angle of this that we can find from anybody else posted their footage and we've
[1:48:05.800 --> 1:48:12.200]  looked at our own and you know these guys are yelling things pretty much as rabble rousers
[1:48:12.200 --> 1:48:16.680]  they were you know one minute they're shooting their shit they're yelling you know kill michelle
[1:48:16.680 --> 1:48:22.760]  and the next minute they're yelling alex jones is a corporate stew so and definitely not to
[1:48:22.760 --> 1:48:27.960]  excuse them yelling you know kill michelle that's a terribly violent thing to yell even if you're
[1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:34.680]  joking but i got the sense that that they were not there with him specifically okay well i'm
[1:48:34.680 --> 1:48:40.920]  fine with that but you know the confrontation i'm fine with that well the people that did call for
[1:48:40.920 --> 1:48:45.480]  her death they should have been arrested uh or at least reprimanded for the behavior you don't call
[1:48:45.480 --> 1:48:51.720]  for someone's death but there you have a pajamas media with michelle malkin admitting they were
[1:48:51.720 --> 1:48:56.280]  not with alex jones but they keep trying to say that you know alex had this model of people he
[1:48:56.280 --> 1:49:01.320]  wasn't there with the idiot's dress like mickey mouse trying to levitate the uh the denverment
[1:49:01.320 --> 1:49:05.000]  yeah if you haven't been listening the past couple days that's right the lead guy got dressed up
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:09.560]  like mickey mouse from fantasia with his magical wand and led about a hundred people to try to
[1:49:09.560 --> 1:49:17.400]  levitate the denverment talk about trying to make you know the scent look asinine that's how you do
[1:49:17.400 --> 1:49:23.160]  it you dress up like a clown and you say that you're going to levitate something and you get
[1:49:23.160 --> 1:49:26.760]  other people to do it too i saw one of these guys and like a leotard in a cape and i was just
[1:49:26.760 --> 1:49:35.000]  i hurled my lunch into a bag come on but this is what they like they like to uh see that to me
[1:49:35.000 --> 1:49:39.560]  that's the fringe group the fringe group of idiots that have no idea what's going on they want to
[1:49:39.560 --> 1:49:44.040]  they just want to be for something you know what i mean it's kind of like those people that want to
[1:49:44.040 --> 1:49:49.160]  you know join pita because they they think that it's hip it's cool or we're going to join the
[1:49:49.160 --> 1:49:53.240]  peace corps because it's hip or cool now there's anything wrong with the peace corps even you
[1:49:53.240 --> 1:50:01.000]  know some things in pita although you know i i don't really you know have a huge position on animal
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:05.720]  rights you know obviously i don't think we should be torturing animals but i think we got a lot more
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:09.400]  human rights issues that we need to deal with before we get to animal rights so to me a lot of
[1:50:09.400 --> 1:50:13.480]  the people that are inside pita are just wasting their time uh you want to save something why don't
[1:50:13.480 --> 1:50:18.840]  you save humanity why don't you save the human race that's that's where my money is it's on the human
[1:50:18.840 --> 1:50:25.880]  race that's who i care about people not a dog or a cat or a fish i mean sure there's a place for that
[1:50:25.880 --> 1:50:31.880]  but come on so again they try to show the most ludicrous people and they try to show them as you know
[1:50:33.640 --> 1:50:39.480]  radical leftists or anarchists or part of alex jones's group because they don't want people to
[1:50:39.480 --> 1:50:43.720]  confront the real issues they don't want people to know about 9 11 truth they don't want people to
[1:50:43.720 --> 1:50:49.080]  go to info wars dot com and get fabled enemies and make copies we'll be back after this with a brand

[1:54:31.560 --> 1:54:36.680]  ever we are going to play fabled enemies trailer three which is out on youtube right now and you're
[1:54:36.680 --> 1:54:41.880]  going to be able to get the high quality version of that info wars dot com very excited about this
[1:54:41.880 --> 1:54:46.600]  film this is the continuity of government trailer and then later we're also going to be playing a
[1:54:46.600 --> 1:54:51.160]  teaser or an excerpt from the movie in the continuity of government section that's the
[1:54:51.160 --> 1:54:55.720]  shadow government for the lamers out there that's a little dumb and dumber joke for those who actually
[1:54:56.440 --> 1:55:00.760]  you know still watch a little pop culture here and there so without further ado let's cue up
[1:55:00.760 --> 1:55:12.600]  fabled enemies trailer three this program was launched in the early 80s headed by none other
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:20.200]  than george herbert walker bush was being made to consolidate continuity of government programs
[1:55:20.200 --> 1:55:26.600]  across several major departments of the government under one office which turned out later to be
[1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:32.520]  called the national program office is i understood if this office fell under the jurisdiction of the
[1:55:32.520 --> 1:55:42.040]  office of the vice president then vice president was the first to charge on 9 11 this program was
[1:55:42.040 --> 1:55:47.640]  put into effect this next one happens a lot these days it seems like a story that is both
[1:55:47.640 --> 1:55:52.760]  reassuring and scary at the same time this morning we learned that the vice president wasn't the only
[1:55:52.760 --> 1:55:59.960]  one sent to an undisclosed location on september 11th that an entire backup government was and is
[1:55:59.960 --> 1:56:06.360]  still there and may be there for as long as anyone now at least can imagine traveling in iowa the
[1:56:06.360 --> 1:56:10.920]  president for the first time discussed a secret ongoing operation designed to keep the federal
[1:56:10.920 --> 1:56:17.080]  government running if washington is paralyzed by a terrorist strike i still take the threats that we
[1:56:17.080 --> 1:56:23.560]  receive from alcada killers and terrorists very seriously the operation was first reported by
[1:56:23.560 --> 1:56:28.920]  the washington post and confirmed to cnn by several administration officials the shadow or
[1:56:28.920 --> 1:56:34.120]  bunker government involves roughly 100 senior staffers from every cabinet department and major
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:39.240]  government agency operates primarily out of two secret bunkers in the eastern united states
[1:56:39.960 --> 1:56:44.280]  and is charged with running the executive branch if communication with washington is severed
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:50.840]  the secret plan took shape in the minutes and hours after the september 11th strikes as mr bush
[1:56:50.840 --> 1:56:55.960]  took a cautious route back to washington and now nearly six months later administration officials
[1:56:55.960 --> 1:57:00.600]  are scrambling to get more telephone lines and high-tech computers into these secret bunkers
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:05.000]  and at least one member of the bush cabinet is being kept out of washington at all times
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:10.920]  under heavy security just in case this so-called shadow government is activated and needs a leader
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:15.800]  but go back to bed folks there is no shadow government that was actually the teaser and
[1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:20.360]  not the trailer will play the trailer for you in the next hour but that's a little excerpt from
[1:57:20.360 --> 1:57:25.720]  fabled enemies you get to hear my beautiful little voice on the voiceover but you know
[1:57:25.720 --> 1:57:28.920]  when your friends tell you that the shadow government doesn't exist and that's for tinfoil
[1:57:28.920 --> 1:57:33.560]  hat wearers well why don't you point them to that that little cnn clip to two cnn news clips
[1:57:33.560 --> 1:57:39.560]  actually and more hard articles presented in the movie as well so obviously continuity of
[1:57:39.560 --> 1:57:44.760]  government is real obviously in the eighties it was restructured under george hw bush
[1:57:45.480 --> 1:57:48.680]  in order to start the sole source contract a little black ops here and there
[1:57:49.400 --> 1:57:53.640]  probably where they ran their drugs through a little continuity of government program
[1:57:53.640 --> 1:57:58.840]  while fema cia and others under the national programs office and of course through global
[1:57:58.840 --> 1:58:04.200]  guardian we had five e four bs in the morning or in the air on the morning of nine eleven
[1:58:04.200 --> 1:58:13.800]  what is an e four b well an e four b is a command plane for members of the shadow government
[1:58:15.560 --> 1:58:18.760]  weird that they were on the scene of the pentagon in the world traits and well the attacks
[1:58:18.760 --> 1:58:22.520]  happened not in the official version though not according to the nine eleven commission report

[2:00:54.200 --> 2:00:59.880]  forty four that's eight six six five eight five four zero four four and these people have one of
[2:00:59.880 --> 2:01:06.760]  the coolest little inventions i've ever seen and tasted it's water from air basically you get this
[2:01:06.760 --> 2:01:11.960]  thing that's about as the size of what you would have if you had like a deer park that's good
[2:01:11.960 --> 2:01:16.360]  water thing and you have to fill it up and or have it delivered or if you had like a
[2:01:17.240 --> 2:01:21.640]  water filtration system you got to fill that up too and you got to wait well this you don't
[2:01:21.640 --> 2:01:25.480]  fill up this pulls water from air that's right it pulls it right from the humidity you don't have
[2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:30.760]  to worry about filtering for fluoride it does that for you filters out all and any toxins
[2:01:30.760 --> 2:01:34.360]  that are in the air and you know what you're drinking you're drinking water from the air you
[2:01:34.360 --> 2:01:42.280]  know it hasn't been uh you know fluoridated there's no salt in it it's straight from the air it pays
[2:01:42.280 --> 2:01:49.080]  for itself in a year if you buy bottled water it's relatively cheap actually uh it has unlimited
[2:01:49.080 --> 2:01:52.840]  water and it produces about seven and a half gallons a day think about that seven and a half
[2:01:52.840 --> 2:01:57.480]  gallons a day and then on top of that you can choose either cold water which you can set the
[2:01:57.480 --> 2:02:03.000]  temperature at or hot water for your tea there's two separate buttons it's very easy to clean
[2:02:03.000 --> 2:02:09.240]  i think the filters for it um i think they last over a year if cleaned properly it uses reverse
[2:02:09.240 --> 2:02:14.040]  osmosis it really doesn't get any better than a cola blue so go to a cola blue dot com that's
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:22.920]  e-c-o-l-o-b-l-u-e dot com e-c-o-l-o-b-l-u-e dot com or call eight six six five eight five four zero
[2:02:22.920 --> 2:02:28.040]  four four that's eight six six five eight five four zero four four i'm actually going to miss that
[2:02:28.040 --> 2:02:32.520]  system i may have to buy one when i get back into new york because it is just the coolest thing
[2:02:32.520 --> 2:02:36.600]  water tastes great and i never have to fill it up i just have to plug it in i mean if you have a
[2:02:36.600 --> 2:02:42.120]  generator this is a great thing uh for survivalists you don't have to worry about purifying water
[2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:48.600]  because it'll pull it from the air and purify it for you it's a short segment so i want to make sure
[2:02:48.600 --> 2:02:54.440]  that if you haven't been listening and that you know that uh in the dallas morning news has reported
[2:02:54.440 --> 2:02:59.240]  that alex jones was the one saying kill michelle malkin and we need your help listeners we need
[2:02:59.240 --> 2:03:03.800]  you to call these ceo's and the editors of the dallas morning news and demand an apology and

[2:03:12.760 --> 2:03:18.280]  revolting disgusting human being for writing what you wrote but on top of it being illegal

[2:03:33.000 --> 2:03:43.000]  and demand that retraction the publisher and chief executive officer his number is 214-977-6685

[2:04:20.600 --> 2:04:26.920]  what loose change second edition and loose change final cut is is video evidence and the video evidence
[2:04:26.920 --> 2:04:32.520]  that alex jones not only wasn't with these people but wasn't calling for death is irrefutable
[2:04:33.720 --> 2:04:38.440]  but that's okay i'm sure this will do a report on it and say uh alex jones said kill michelle

[2:08:50.200 --> 2:08:56.200]  listening to that michelle malek and pajama's media clip and you know there's the proof right
[2:08:56.200 --> 2:09:01.400]  there when i need you to call paul watson our current we need to point out that you know here is
[2:09:01.400 --> 2:09:05.480]  the malican people saying alex didn't do it that is the proof that is that because the
[2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:11.000]  dallas morning news may try to flounder around and you know make stuff up here are the supposed
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:15.960]  victims uh... you know missus let's put everybody in a concentration camp malek and
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:23.160]  wanta mobe is wonderful and this is a demon let's post that and you know make the point here it is
[2:09:23.160 --> 2:09:29.080]  retract put the dallas morning news on those want to make sure by those i need that done now
[2:09:29.080 --> 2:09:33.640]  because i'm tied down here well i sent the link to paul joseph watson over an hour ago so i do
[2:09:33.640 --> 2:09:37.880]  hope he's working on it he has the uh... mp3 of that and i think he is working on a story i know
[2:09:37.880 --> 2:09:42.280]  he's posted the inside edition and we post we uh... played that clip on air as well we're doing a
[2:09:42.280 --> 2:09:47.800]  great job i wonder how many calls they've gotten i would imagine a lot since next last segment i gave
[2:09:47.800 --> 2:09:52.920]  out the phone numbers yet again and uh... the more this we play i mean it's it's absolutely obvious
[2:09:52.920 --> 2:09:58.360]  even her own people are having to admit that you didn't say kill michelle malek and you and but they
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:03.880]  still try to play it off like you were violent you were never violent well well well well well
[2:10:03.880 --> 2:10:10.920]  let's be technical they play it off like i in cited those guys to do that that's what they're
[2:10:10.920 --> 2:10:15.960]  doing they're they're playing it off and saying okay they weren't they were you know you didn't
[2:10:15.960 --> 2:10:22.200]  say it alex jones didn't say it but team inside the young men to do it those young men
[2:10:22.840 --> 2:10:27.000]  were with malek and they were with they knew the other local bloggers they left
[2:10:27.000 --> 2:10:32.440]  with her in a group they were making fun of us they would scream out show the capitalist pig
[2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:36.120]  and then one minute later kill michelle malek and and then when the liberals will all come up they'd
[2:10:36.120 --> 2:10:40.200]  say it's alex jones the fastest pig and then one of them got fooled and came up sort of bumping into
[2:10:40.200 --> 2:10:46.680]  me and pushing me so i pushed him back so let's be technical the big god you know the big six
[2:10:46.680 --> 2:10:51.800]  foot six chubby guy that was with malek and with the other members of his media he came up
[2:10:51.800 --> 2:10:56.760]  sort of bumping into me and i did push him back and then once i was trying to go around him
[2:10:56.760 --> 2:11:01.640]  he stuck his elbow out so i just elbowed it right back um so you know that happened there
[2:11:02.200 --> 2:11:07.640]  the other guy was a liberal who got fooled by them chanting that i was the fascist pig yeah and you
[2:11:07.640 --> 2:11:11.800]  actually did an interview with him the next day and he didn't even know who michelle malek and
[2:11:11.800 --> 2:11:16.200]  was he barely knew who bill o'reilly was i could be more clueless yeah they were telling him that
[2:11:16.200 --> 2:11:20.440]  i was a fascist right wing fox guy and so he foolishly was defending you know the you know
[2:11:20.440 --> 2:11:26.040]  the brown skin lady so it was it was all a race thing and he got up and was pushing me with his
[2:11:26.040 --> 2:11:31.000]  hands i've been pushing back and then he exaggerated that like he was gonna fall down uh but other
[2:11:31.000 --> 2:11:35.400]  than that i went up with asking serious questions at first then they got in our space then their
[2:11:35.400 --> 2:11:39.720]  provocateurs came over and and that's where it all goes crazy that's where everything goes haywire
[2:11:39.720 --> 2:11:44.520]  when they start screening kill michelle malek and so so the news here is it isn't just that they
[2:11:44.520 --> 2:11:50.600]  falsely charged me with saying killer it's that they staged it there should be an investigation
[2:11:50.600 --> 2:11:58.520]  this is very serious this shows another level of this fox news type reporter deception i mean
[2:11:58.520 --> 2:12:04.680]  that is incredibly elaborate but there they are doing it and now the tide is completely
[2:12:04.680 --> 2:12:11.080]  turned against them we're routing them they are in full retreat blast their phones ladies and
[2:12:11.080 --> 2:12:15.720]  gentlemen let's get out all the numbers what's about every number we've got right now the

[2:14:14.440 --> 2:14:20.360]  controlled them and he said it doesn't matter if they were with her i understand i'm mind
[2:14:20.360 --> 2:14:24.600]  controlled the people with michelle malkin to yell kill michelle malkin i mean that is
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:29.320]  talk about a conspiracy theory it's absolutely ridiculous it's absolutely ridiculous you're
[2:14:29.320 --> 2:14:33.240]  always the bad guy alex it's it's just something we can't get past with the mainstream media for
[2:14:33.240 --> 2:14:39.160]  some reason well here he is saying okay well well you know they're with her but you you incited her
[2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:44.840]  friends to say killer i mean that is ridiculous i mean now now they're going okay well you okay
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:48.520]  they're friends with her okay they're with her you know they're with a blog that's with her
[2:14:48.520 --> 2:14:55.400]  uh okay well you you made him do it you did you did now if you the more i think about this the
[2:14:55.400 --> 2:14:59.000]  more i watch it because i've been so busy doing stuff finally getting the chance to watch it last
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:03.320]  night i watched it a few hours before but now i have to really watch it everything is pretty subdued
[2:15:04.040 --> 2:15:09.000]  i mean i'm you know we're raising voices until those guys come and jump and start going hey alex
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:14.200]  jones high five and i'm like yeah you know and and and then they start scaling kill kill kill
[2:15:14.200 --> 2:15:21.880]  kill so um just amazing absolutely amazing but this is why their blogs are imploding this is
[2:15:21.880 --> 2:15:26.120]  why mainstream news is losing all his credibility because the people have caught him in a million
[2:15:26.120 --> 2:15:30.680]  lies i mean michelle malkin said we lied about the dog i mean think about that when they knew it was
[2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:39.240]  true they said we were liars i mean this is just amazing amazing the deception that these people
[2:15:39.240 --> 2:15:44.840]  engage in so this is a lot bigger than alex jones or info wars dot com or any of us this this affects
[2:15:44.840 --> 2:15:48.600]  everybody jason i'm gonna let you get back to work my friend all right thank you so much alex we'll
[2:15:48.600 --> 2:15:53.080]  have bermus don't forget folks those new trailers are up on info wars dot com help us get them out

[2:15:59.000 --> 2:16:04.280]  enemies right now so let's throw in the cog trailer this is the trailer not the teaser folks
[2:16:04.280 --> 2:16:10.200]  for fabled enemies dropping to the info war august 31st only at prismplanet.tv now to one
[2:16:10.200 --> 2:16:14.840]  of the eeriest moments amid the carnage of 9 11 a mysterious plane was seen flying right over
[2:16:14.840 --> 2:16:19.320]  the president's residence even some CNN staffers saw it to this day it has never been officially
[2:16:19.320 --> 2:16:25.000]  explained there is also footage of another white mystery plane in the restricted airspace over new
[2:16:25.000 --> 2:16:38.920]  york city the shadow or bunker government involves roughly 100 senior staffers from every cabinet
[2:16:38.920 --> 2:16:44.040]  department and major government agency vice president dick cheney is there along with national
[2:16:44.040 --> 2:17:01.720]  security advisor condolese rice what i want to say to my uh my democratic friends in the congress
[2:17:02.520 --> 2:17:10.120]  is that they need to be very cautious not to seek political advantage by making incendiary
[2:17:10.120 --> 2:17:16.440]  suggestions as were made by some today that the white house had advanced information
[2:17:17.160 --> 2:17:20.280]  that would have prevented the tragic attacks of 9 11
[2:17:23.560 --> 2:17:28.520]  well there you have it it is fabled enemies and uh it's my latest my greatest my i guess
[2:17:28.520 --> 2:17:33.480]  directorial debut although i was pretty heavily involved in loose change i mean obviously i didn't
[2:17:33.480 --> 2:17:38.360]  do the editing but uh a lot of those sections i sat there and you know demanded this or that
[2:17:38.360 --> 2:17:44.040]  whether i got it or not is another story and i wrote a lot of it too but uh this is all me and uh
[2:17:45.400 --> 2:17:50.360]  i'm pretty proud of it uh you know this is that this is really a warm up to my new world order
[2:17:50.360 --> 2:17:54.440]  film but i also feel that this is a powerful film because on the heels of the bush administration
[2:17:54.440 --> 2:17:58.760]  some people still don't know about 9 11 truth some people are turned off by the situation at the
[2:17:58.760 --> 2:18:04.520]  pentagon or the control demolition aspects of will trade center 1 and 2 and this movie doesn't
[2:18:04.520 --> 2:18:09.160]  follow that this is about the fbi whistleblowers this is about the international intelligence
[2:18:09.160 --> 2:18:16.680]  organization that included israel pakistan members of our own government saudi arabia
[2:18:16.680 --> 2:18:23.240]  okay that's what this movie is about this movie is about bin laden being cia in the 80s and working
[2:18:23.240 --> 2:18:29.320]  with pakistani militants back then this is about the bogeyman folks and it's it's about time to
[2:18:29.320 --> 2:18:35.080]  expose the bogeyman and we do that by exposing the initial congressional investigation into 9 11 we
[2:18:35.080 --> 2:18:39.720]  expose the 9 11 commission for what it was a whitewash we actually have one of the uh
[2:18:41.240 --> 2:18:45.720]  commissioners that left uh that's max cleland because he was just so disgusted with it
[2:18:45.720 --> 2:18:49.560]  on wolf blitzer just going nuts about what a cover up the 9 11 commission was
[2:18:52.680 --> 2:18:57.320]  but don't take my word for it it's the info war on august 31st very psyched up
[2:18:57.320 --> 2:19:02.600]  and only you can make it big folks you can decide whether this is a big movie you can decide whether
[2:19:02.600 --> 2:19:07.720]  this goes to the top of youtube and google video uh you can embed it on your myspace page you can
[2:19:07.720 --> 2:19:13.000]  write about it on your blog you can email it to all your friends because we make these movies

[2:26:18.200 --> 2:26:23.640]  the internet in your head with a brain chip oh they have brain chips by the way it's real
[2:26:23.640 --> 2:26:27.240]  it's not something i'm just talking about it's not something that's experimental anymore it's
[2:26:27.240 --> 2:26:33.240]  something that's happened now publicly for many a year don't believe me just check out uh blind
[2:26:33.240 --> 2:26:38.440]  guys that can now see what they do is they put a small chip in their brain they look up kind of a
[2:26:38.440 --> 2:26:42.680]  camera to where their eye would be and they see kind of like the predator anybody who's a big fan
[2:26:42.680 --> 2:26:48.440]  of the predator movies knows what i'm talking about they see shapes and colors and uh i i suppose
[2:26:48.440 --> 2:26:53.160]  it's a lot worse than like being colorblind but you can make out objects all all thanks to a
[2:26:53.160 --> 2:26:58.440]  chip in your brain now am i opposed to that absolutely not i understand that there are
[2:26:58.440 --> 2:27:03.960]  benefits to technology and that is one of them but when they say hey why don't you take this
[2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:10.600]  brain chip uh to get on the net or why don't you take this brain chip to be able to do cool things
[2:27:11.240 --> 2:27:16.680]  like i don't know in 2004 guys were putting chips in their hands a guy wrote a book called
[2:27:16.680 --> 2:27:22.680]  rfid toys where they're literally turning on lights turning lights off um opening doors
[2:27:22.680 --> 2:27:28.520]  with it that was out of that 2004 report with peter jennings on the microchip and the mexican
[2:27:28.520 --> 2:27:33.720]  officials who had taken it don't believe me just google it check out verichip check out how they
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:39.640]  actually paid the jacobson family back in 2001 right after the terrorist attacks in 9 11 to go
[2:27:39.640 --> 2:27:48.440]  on the today show live and take chips let me say it again they went on the today show and took chips
[2:27:48.440 --> 2:27:54.600]  chips and they literally said that if it if it was there to fight terrorism and protect her family
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:28:01.560]  she was more than willing to take it well thanks so much for trying to soften america to the idea

[2:28:08.600 --> 2:28:15.800]  beyond anything that i could ever dream of you know i remember being a little kid going to church
[2:28:15.800 --> 2:28:20.280]  a lot hearing this mark of the beast talk and hearing about how they were going to chip humanity and
[2:28:20.280 --> 2:28:24.840]  hearing about how the new world order was going to form and come and get us and i laughed i laughed
[2:28:24.840 --> 2:28:31.960]  real hard i didn't believe any of it i thought it was all nonsense all crackpot talk as i grew up it
[2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:38.440]  even became more crackpot-ish to me you know wcw had hulk hogan and the gang wearing nwo shirts it
[2:28:38.440 --> 2:28:44.280]  was a wrestling group that's all the new world order was they weren't planning to chip me but then

[2:36:28.040 --> 2:36:33.560]  funding to the al-qaeda and the taliban and that is indeed classified let's hit it
[2:36:35.560 --> 2:36:41.560]  senator joe biden who had also met with the head of the pakistani isi would have harsh words on the
[2:36:41.560 --> 2:36:53.960]  senate floor and the word should go out to those who pretend that they wish to be our friends that
[2:36:53.960 --> 2:37:00.360]  they're going to have to make some very difficult choices pakistan in particular is going to have
[2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:09.320]  to make a very difficult choice very soon words will not be sufficient actions will be demanded
[2:37:10.680 --> 2:37:15.960]  when biden was confronted he confirmed his meeting with him at saying pakistani intelligence
[2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:23.320]  was indeed funding the taliban in the days following not 11 you met with the head of
[2:37:23.320 --> 2:37:28.520]  pakistani isi general muhad admet it has since come to light that he ordered shahid sheik to wire
[2:37:28.520 --> 2:37:33.800]  100,000 miles to muhammad adha why was he allowed to go back to pakistan and why wasn't he questioned
[2:37:33.800 --> 2:37:40.360]  and why were you meeting with him i met with him to deliver a message that if he didn't if he didn't
[2:37:41.000 --> 2:37:46.440]  stop supporting the taliban we would take him why did we let him go we let him fly freely we
[2:37:46.440 --> 2:37:51.480]  never investigated him we never even looked into him look first thing called diplomatic passports
[2:37:51.480 --> 2:37:55.880]  we did not arrest krushchev when he came but he finally did not jackers and you let him go and
[2:37:55.880 --> 2:38:00.440]  he's free to hijack the fight hijack no one knew we find it's not hijacked it's why i didn't say
[2:38:00.440 --> 2:38:09.400]  get away he would later state that the information was indeed classified how did you know that the
[2:38:09.400 --> 2:38:19.080]  isi was helping the taliban sir how did you know that it's not fun oh that's classified well thanks
[2:38:19.080 --> 2:38:26.280]  for clearing that up joey b thanks for not talking about it you see how what a tough guy he was on
[2:38:26.280 --> 2:38:34.920]  september 12 words will not be sufficient actions will be demanded i'm joseph biden meanwhile the
[2:38:34.920 --> 2:38:41.720]  guy knows that pakistan is funding these uh islamo fascists i mean i can hardly call them that because
[2:38:41.720 --> 2:38:45.880]  let's be real a lot of these guys are government agents and we interviewed j michael springman
[2:38:45.880 --> 2:38:53.400]  in this film and he is the former head of the visa department in jeta saudi arabia now he worked
[2:38:53.400 --> 2:39:00.520]  there for a couple years in the late 80s early 90s and he kept denying certain people visas
[2:39:01.720 --> 2:39:05.720]  and he would get calls from his superiors going on and on and on you need to give them a visa and
[2:39:05.720 --> 2:39:12.120]  he would say why and then they would retort well we need that uh we need them to have that visa
[2:39:12.120 --> 2:39:17.000]  for national security purposes it's like national security purpose what are you talking about and
[2:39:17.000 --> 2:39:25.800]  later when he came to the states he realized that this was a cia front base and they were using it
[2:39:25.800 --> 2:39:34.040]  i mean let me say this again they were using this base to funnel in islamic militants aka islamic
[2:39:34.040 --> 2:39:39.880]  terrorists into the united states with the help of their asset let me say it again with the help
[2:39:39.880 --> 2:39:48.040]  of their asset osal bin laden interesting that this was going on in the late 80s early 90s
[2:39:48.040 --> 2:39:55.240]  and then we find out you know later on that the hijackers 15 of the 19 hijackers or the
[2:39:55.240 --> 2:40:01.560]  supposed hijackers the alleged hijackers whatever you want to call them came from this very place
[2:40:01.560 --> 2:40:11.240]  this very consulate in jeta saudi arabia so 15 of the 19 guys get their uh get their visas
[2:40:11.240 --> 2:40:18.600]  from this cia base then they move on the majority of these same guys to train at places like the
[2:40:18.600 --> 2:40:25.720]  pentacola navy station in florida like the defense language school in monterey california
[2:40:25.720 --> 2:40:33.000]  like brooks air force base like maxwell air force base in montgomery alabama all that's
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:38.840]  happening but no they don't have any ties to the united states intelligence services
[2:40:40.040 --> 2:40:47.160]  hell otta and three of the other guys did dry runs before the attack james woods was on a
[2:40:47.160 --> 2:40:54.680]  plane with these guys okay in august prior to the attacks he saw them clearly for what they were in
[2:40:54.680 --> 2:40:59.400]  his comments by the way word for word are i either thought that these guys were terrorists
[2:40:59.400 --> 2:41:04.120]  or law enforcement because they had that look like they were on a mission that's also in the
[2:41:04.120 --> 2:41:08.760]  mood the movie so this guy is scared to death that they're going to hijack the plane he talks to the
[2:41:08.760 --> 2:41:14.120]  stewardess stewardess agrees she's scared to death she pulls the pilot out of the cockpit the guy
[2:41:14.120 --> 2:41:18.200]  comes out of the cockpit james woods starts talking to him about these guys and he goes yeah this does
[2:41:18.200 --> 2:41:24.600]  look very suspicious they look very very suspicious so suspicious in fact that the pilot the steward
[2:41:24.600 --> 2:41:30.360] ess and james woods that's three people okay all files separate reports to the f a a
[2:41:32.920 --> 2:41:40.120]  nothing's done it's just like when uh the neighbors call the cia not the police
[2:41:40.120 --> 2:41:46.920]  not the fb i the cia on the lead al sherry and otta and others because they can clearly see
[2:41:46.920 --> 2:41:51.880]  something bizarre is going on next door they don't do anything so the f a is worn two of the
[2:41:51.880 --> 2:41:57.560]  hijackers live with a well-tested and known fb i informant the cia is called on these guys nothing
[2:41:57.560 --> 2:42:04.840]  is done and they're making dry runs of the attack prior to 9 11 does it look to you like these guys
[2:42:04.840 --> 2:42:11.000]  might have been government agents running a drill kind of like amalgam vergo which took place months
[2:42:11.000 --> 2:42:16.360]  before 9 11 and which hijacked aircraft commercial aircraft are flown into the capitol building
[2:42:16.360 --> 2:42:21.720]  and of course osama and laudan is the coverboy for that also in the picture fabled enemies
[2:42:23.560 --> 2:42:27.800]  well it shouldn't come as a shock then that there were other targets on the morning 9 11
[2:42:28.520 --> 2:42:35.560]  and that indeed there was a lot more going on and there were other perpetrators for instance
[2:42:35.560 --> 2:42:39.720]  a lot of people still don't know the the story of united 23 at a new work new jersey
[2:42:39.720 --> 2:42:46.920]  now the attacks have already begun the pilot is in the cockpit on the runway ready to take off
[2:42:46.920 --> 2:42:51.960]  and he starts hearing this stuff and he looks back and he sees five guys four i'm sorry four guys
[2:42:52.840 --> 2:42:58.840]  that he is immediately suspicious of let me say that again he sees these guys he's immediately
[2:42:58.840 --> 2:43:03.880]  suspicious so what does he do he pulls it back in he says oh there's some technical difficulties
[2:43:03.880 --> 2:43:11.480]  will be taken off in a while then everybody asked is asked to board the plane everybody
[2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:17.640]  deborts with these guys they refuse to get off the plane what's going on i don't understand why
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:22.680]  won't they get off the plane so after a little bit of a scuffle and this and that they are let go
[2:43:22.680 --> 2:43:28.600]  in other words they're let off the plane now you would think if you're you know not doing anything
[2:43:28.600 --> 2:43:32.840]  wrong and you just got your flight canceled and you're ready to you know still travel that you're
[2:43:32.840 --> 2:43:36.760]  going to stick around at least to get your bags if they canceled your flight right you're going to
[2:43:36.760 --> 2:43:42.200]  want your bags correct these guys didn't they just took right off out of the airport and then low
[2:43:42.200 --> 2:43:49.560]  and behold they find their suitcases and they're filled with al-qaeda training manuals blueprints
[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:57.320]  for buildings blueprints for the plane but you know what else they're full of false identification
[2:43:58.040 --> 2:44:02.280]  so these guys are never brought to justice never arrested kind of ties in with the fact that they
[2:44:02.280 --> 2:44:07.720]  found weapons on several other planes including theirs planted that's not in the official version
[2:44:07.720 --> 2:44:12.360]  of events that you know knives and possibly guns were planted on these planes bizarre huh
[2:44:13.800 --> 2:44:20.760]  well here's what's really bizarre is that the FBI says we couldn't find them because
[2:44:21.560 --> 2:44:28.840]  they used false identities yet the other hijackers otta and others were identified the same exact way
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:34.840]  from their bags that magically didn't make the flight in other words they're on a suicide mission
[2:44:35.560 --> 2:44:41.560]  the guy packs all sorts of incriminating events karan's blueprints of buildings blueprints of
[2:44:41.560 --> 2:44:48.280]  the cockpit flight instruction manuals the whole nine and from that suitcase that's how they start
[2:44:48.280 --> 2:44:55.640]  identifying the hijackers okay so they use that to identify the hijackers and they say they're using
[2:44:55.640 --> 2:44:59.800]  real identification actually they didn't say that initially the FBI had to cop to the fact
[2:44:59.800 --> 2:45:03.560]  that many of the hijackers may have been using false identification weird
[2:45:06.920 --> 2:45:12.280]  folks it stinks to high hell and it is just so upsetting to me that people are still buying
[2:45:12.280 --> 2:45:15.800]  into the official version of 9-11 and that's why i continue to make these films it's what
[2:45:15.800 --> 2:45:20.920]  our entire foreign and domestic policy is based on and it's gearing me up to play the first trailer
[2:45:20.920 --> 2:45:27.160]  let's let's cue up the first trailer from fabled enemies the bin laden trailer and let's play that
[2:45:27.160 --> 2:45:38.120]  let's let's hit it john the relationship between bin laden and cia was essentially uh
[2:45:38.840 --> 2:45:43.000]  he was one of the assets one of the people they could turn to they wanted something done they
[2:45:43.000 --> 2:45:49.160]  went to bin laden in the early 1980s bin laden worked with operatives from us intelligence
[2:45:49.160 --> 2:45:55.720]  the pakistani military and arab states is it not true that the united states government
[2:45:55.720 --> 2:46:01.320]  paid 300 million dollars to the bin laden family for the construction of the military camps
[2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:10.680]  at basis though i really think that these were more cia assets people that were recruited like
[2:46:11.560 --> 2:46:17.400]  all of the folks i have been issuing visas to then we have that mysterious suitcase
[2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:23.080]  with all of the hijackers names and all of this incriminating evidence why put a coran why put
[2:46:23.080 --> 2:46:27.480]  flight manuals why put all this incriminating information if it's supposedly going to get burned
[2:46:27.480 --> 2:46:41.320]  up let's show you some video that was taken eight days after 9 11 that man there is osama
[2:46:41.320 --> 2:46:47.640]  bin laden's younger brother khalil and that family that took off that's a crime i was surprised
[2:46:48.200 --> 2:46:53.400]  at the evidence that there were foreign governments involved most of that information is classified
[2:46:53.400 --> 2:47:07.400]  i think overly classified osama bin laden osama bin laden osama bin laden remember 24 hours ago
[2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:13.080]  it was the bush tax cut the bush budget the bush economy you don't hear any of that tonight
[2:47:13.080 --> 2:47:20.040]  it's america's enemy america's under attack all right folks there it is fabled enemies come to
[2:47:20.040 --> 2:47:27.320]  the info war august 31st the prison planet dot tv now i want to uh jump over to this popular
[2:47:27.320 --> 2:47:32.120]  mechanics article saying that six debunked 9 11 conspiracy claims found from today's
[2:47:32.120 --> 2:47:38.840]  honest report now this was published a few days ago last week i think and it's just totally and
[2:47:38.840 --> 2:47:44.520]  completely bull okay total and complete bull let me say it again total and complete bull i'm just
[2:47:44.520 --> 2:47:50.280]  going to read one of them right now claim no combination of debris damage fuel tank explosions
[2:47:50.280 --> 2:47:54.760]  and fires can inflict the kind of simultaneous damage to all buildings columns required to
[2:47:54.760 --> 2:47:59.320]  make the building implode says world trade center seven dot net a web site dedicated to
[2:47:59.320 --> 2:48:04.440]  the conspiracy theories no it's not a website dedicated conspiracy theories it's a website
[2:48:04.440 --> 2:48:09.800]  dedicated to the truth about 9 11 the precision of such damage required to bring building 7 down
[2:48:09.800 --> 2:48:14.040]  into its own footprint was especially great given the ratio of its height and its width
[2:48:14.040 --> 2:48:20.360]  and its depth now here's the nist uh report rebuttal are you ready fire did indeed inflict
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:24.680]  enough column damage to destroy the building through though a previous through a previously
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:33.240]  undocumented collapse sequence of thermal expansion let's just read into that first of all
[2:48:33.240 --> 2:48:37.480]  notice they took out the fuel tank explosions notice they took out the debris damage and
[2:48:37.480 --> 2:48:43.560]  now it's just fire and it's thermal expansion anyone who has run a tight charlotte underwater
[2:48:43.560 --> 2:48:48.680]  to help loosen it knows that metal expands when it gets hot it's the complete opposite
[2:48:48.680 --> 2:48:54.760]  of what they uh they said in world trade center one and two kevin ryan documented that we're
[2:48:54.760 --> 2:49:00.360]  going to be playing that clip uh tomorrow in the uh final week wrap up where me and kevin ryan
[2:49:00.360 --> 2:49:05.080]  really well kevin ryan and i i'm sorry for the improper english kevin ryan and i discussed the
[2:49:05.080 --> 2:49:11.240]  lies and the nist report as well as uh myself and richard gauge thermal expansion occurs at
[2:49:11.240 --> 2:49:15.560]  temperatures much lower than the heat required to reduce steel steel strength and stiffness
[2:49:15.560 --> 2:49:22.920]  so remember it was so hot in world trade center one and two that they became weakened and then
[2:49:22.920 --> 2:49:27.240]  pulled the building in from the internal columns that's their official line of garbage there but
[2:49:27.240 --> 2:49:33.320]  this is the complete opposite the report found that world trade center seven steel beans expanded
[2:49:33.320 --> 2:49:36.760]  in the heat numerous structural connections throughout the building failed numerous structural
[2:49:36.760 --> 2:49:40.840]  connections no they said one column failed and others followed they weren't be able to prove
[2:49:40.840 --> 2:49:46.760]  that in any way shape or form they simply created a model a 3d model and animated it the way they
[2:49:46.760 --> 2:49:53.240]  like they proved nothing they showed no signs that weakened the structure even before the collapse
[2:49:53.240 --> 2:50:04.040]  of any vertical columns bull total bull it's so frustrating when they put out such a thin veil
[2:50:04.040 --> 2:50:09.880]  of lies and people are sucked into it you know i saw this one really disgusting video where all
[2:50:09.880 --> 2:50:18.680]  they showed was like 10 seconds of the uh the nist report and it's while our reporter begins to
[2:50:18.680 --> 2:50:23.240]  ask a question he starts to ask a question and they shut the lights on off on them and then
[2:50:23.240 --> 2:50:28.520]  then the title of the the blog is that this guy got schooled no you didn't play any of the audio
[2:50:28.520 --> 2:50:34.040]  you played the video portion where he got his light shut off by a bunch of gangsters a bunch of
[2:50:34.040 --> 2:50:41.880]  liars a bunch of people who have no will to bring truth and justice to this country to the people
[2:50:43.160 --> 2:50:47.480]  to the world i'm jason bermus sitting in for alex jones remember the websites are

[2:51:23.160 --> 2:51:28.440]  inside the united states some u.s investigators believe that there are israelis again very much
[2:51:28.440 --> 2:51:35.480]  engaged in spying in and on the u.s i'm aware that some israeli citizens have been detained
[2:51:35.480 --> 2:51:40.760]  and laden's connections to the cia the hijackers ties to the fbi the saudi arabian connection
[2:51:40.760 --> 2:51:45.720]  the israeli intelligence network warnings and war games the shadow government and much much more

[2:54:23.080 --> 2:54:28.440]  bermas i've been with you all week and again i want to thank all the listeners out there for
[2:54:28.440 --> 2:54:34.280]  really supporting me and letting me keep an audience i mean it's it's an honor for me to host the alex
[2:54:34.280 --> 2:54:40.040]  jones show and bring the news to all you folks especially at the dnc the dnc was just a huge
[2:54:40.040 --> 2:54:45.400]  success in my opinion i wish you guys could have seen the course interview i know some of you watch
[2:54:45.400 --> 2:54:50.200]  the nadir uh interview which you can watch over in force dot com right now it's not just the
[2:54:50.200 --> 2:54:54.520]  interview but his speech actually was excellent last night a little long-winded but the end of it
[2:54:54.520 --> 2:55:00.120]  man i was very impressed i liked it you know i like ralph nadir he seems to have a good heart i wish
[2:55:00.120 --> 2:55:04.520]  he combed his hair a little bit better when he gets up there and it's unfortunate that uh
[2:55:05.160 --> 2:55:10.360]  he looks a little cockeyed now and then but he's a hero you know i think he does feel like he has
[2:55:11.160 --> 2:55:15.400]  our best interest at heart and he has fought time and time again to try to bring those best
[2:55:15.400 --> 2:55:20.280]  interests to us he's clashed with others on the left after bringing them up such as michael more
[2:55:20.280 --> 2:55:25.480]  but you know again this guy is really one of the few people that is talking about the corporate
[2:55:25.480 --> 2:55:31.800]  elite and how both parties have been bought and paid for so god bless mr nadir and i wish him all
[2:55:31.800 --> 2:55:37.640]  the best and uh i'm getting over info wars dot com we've got live dnc feeds with alex jones as well
[2:55:37.640 --> 2:55:41.640]  as the archives and when that course the interview hits you're going to want to see that too it's
[2:55:41.640 --> 2:55:47.160]  excellent excellent it's about 10 or 15 minutes but course he's down there kind of incognito
[2:55:47.160 --> 2:55:52.040]  not to really do interviews or promote his number one new york times bestseller obama nation
[2:55:53.080 --> 2:55:57.400]  but to report for world net daily you know one of the one of the better media sources out there
[2:55:57.400 --> 2:56:02.440]  is it the best media source out there no does it carry some of our stuff sometimes
[2:56:03.720 --> 2:56:09.800]  is it critical of us a lot yes but a lot slips through and i actually use world net daily
[2:56:09.800 --> 2:56:17.480]  for a article in fabled enemies called digital moles inside the white house another thing that seems
[2:56:17.480 --> 2:56:22.920]  to uh get lost in translation to people is that the people that carried out 9-11 someone had
[2:56:22.920 --> 2:56:29.800]  somehow had the secret code words for not only air force one but the white house the fbi the cia
[2:56:30.360 --> 2:56:39.480]  the nsa marine corps intelligence and so on and i mean in the film i list i must list a dozen
[2:56:39.480 --> 2:56:48.840]  that they have and they were decoding this in real time very bizarre and then the 9-11 commission
[2:56:48.840 --> 2:56:52.920]  reports that it was the fog of war and that's why they thought that the white house
[2:56:52.920 --> 2:56:56.600]  and air force one were targets now you thought the white house and air force one were targets
[2:56:56.600 --> 2:57:03.960]  because they were targets but you know you can't get that through to some people people don't even
[2:57:03.960 --> 2:57:09.560]  understand how that works out in the bigger picture works out huge because muslims in a cave
[2:57:09.560 --> 2:57:15.640]  didn't just get the nsa's code words that day they didn't just get the cia's code words that day
[2:57:15.640 --> 2:57:20.600]  the fbi the secret service you name it they had it how could that happen unless we had
[2:57:20.600 --> 2:57:28.840]  either several moles inside our own government or a network which had penetrated every aspect
[2:57:28.840 --> 2:57:34.280]  of our government shadow government anyone hell before today a lot of you listeners probably
[2:57:34.280 --> 2:57:38.360]  would have told me the shadow government doesn't exist you probably still tell me it doesn't exist
[2:57:38.360 --> 2:57:42.840]  even though i've played numerous clips today with mainstream media people not only talking about
[2:57:42.840 --> 2:57:48.440]  continuity of government but the shadow or bunker government that clearly clearly exists
[2:57:50.440 --> 2:57:55.640]  i'm gonna be taking your phone calls all next hour i want your thoughts on the dnc just the
[2:57:55.640 --> 2:58:01.000]  whole situation you know that the dnc is wrapping up i don't know if anybody watched hillary clinton
[2:58:01.000 --> 2:58:06.440]  speech last night uh or i'm sorry that was two nights ago clinton's speech uh last night was
[2:58:06.440 --> 2:58:11.480]  her husband and biden of course giving their speech it's really an open forum but if we could

[3:00:08.920 --> 3:00:13.720]  great show for you tomorrow too some of the uh justin dot tv clips that were not played some of
[3:00:13.720 --> 3:00:18.920]  the highlights from this week kevin ryan richard gauge alan watt you name it you don't want to
[3:00:18.920 --> 3:00:25.240]  miss tomorrow's show if you missed any of the programming from earlier in the week now i want
[3:00:25.240 --> 3:00:31.480]  to shift gears really quickly back to the michelle malcon incident it is very serious folks when you
[3:00:31.480 --> 3:00:37.080]  have somebody who is a mainline talk show host let me say this again a mainline talk show host
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:42.600]  not only for fox news on the radio but also hosting for o'reilly one of the biggest fear
[3:00:42.600 --> 3:00:49.160]  mongers liars scare mongers hate mongers just despicable people on the planet at this point
[3:00:49.160 --> 3:00:56.360]  with a large audience unfortunately and that just really really upsets me but this woman malcon
[3:00:57.720 --> 3:01:02.120]  deserve to be confronted and then the mainstream media ran away with this story that alex jones
[3:01:02.120 --> 3:01:06.440]  said kill michelle malcon you know even malcon's people as we played earlier had to admit
[3:01:06.440 --> 3:01:11.320]  that that was indeed false and those people yelling that were not with jones but that
[3:01:11.320 --> 3:01:14.920]  doesn't stop the dallas morning news one of the biggest publications around
[3:01:16.200 --> 3:01:21.480]  from saying that you know jones called for her death so now we need you the listeners to respectfully
[3:01:21.480 --> 3:01:26.440]  call them up and demand a retraction on page one the numbers to call for that if you want to talk
[3:01:26.440 --> 3:01:32.760]  to the ceo is two one four nine seven seven six six eight five that is two one four nine seven
[3:01:32.760 --> 3:01:43.640]  seven six six eight five or the main editor is two one four nine seven seven six eight two eight
[3:01:43.640 --> 3:01:49.320]  two eight and then if you want to get at the managing editor that is two one four nine seven
[3:01:49.320 --> 3:01:54.200]  seven eight three four one if you missed any of that folks you go to info wars dot com now
[3:01:54.200 --> 3:01:59.640]  it is the main story and we need your support we need your help because you know what these
[3:01:59.640 --> 3:02:04.840]  people like to lie they like to make things up but just just for all the day the doubters out
[3:02:04.840 --> 3:02:11.000]  there the haters i'm going to play the pajamas media clip one more time one more time where they
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:19.560]  have to admit yes they were not with alex jones and he was not calling for her death however
[3:02:19.560 --> 3:02:23.000]  they still try to say it was a violent encounter he was trying to incite a riot no one was trying
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:29.080]  to incite a riot nobody used violence the most violent comment were made by these provocateurs
[3:02:29.080 --> 3:02:37.160]  and again they were not with alex jones he didn't particularly seem to like it that somebody
[3:02:38.200 --> 3:02:50.280]  was in the way and he did his best to incite more trouble now it's not absolutely clear to me if
[3:02:51.160 --> 3:02:55.960]  the guy that was yelling kill michelle malcon was one of his people or not it seems plausible it
[3:02:55.960 --> 3:03:02.200]  wasn't i can speak to that actually andrew marcus go ahead we we've looked at every angle that we
[3:03:02.200 --> 3:03:07.720]  can find from anybody else close to their footage and we've looked at our own and you know these
[3:03:07.720 --> 3:03:13.320]  guys are yelling things pretty much as rabble routers they were one minute they're shooting
[3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:17.880]  they should they're yelling you know kill michelle and the next minute they're yelling alex jones
[3:03:17.880 --> 3:03:23.640]  is a corporate stew just so and definitely not to excuse them yelling you know kill michelle
[3:03:23.640 --> 3:03:29.160]  yes dead terribly violent thing to yell even if you're joking but i got the sense that
[3:03:29.720 --> 3:03:35.720]  that they were not there with him specifically okay well i'm fine with that but you know the
[3:03:35.720 --> 3:03:42.600]  well i'm fine with that but uh i'm going to continue to uh you know go after jones and uh
[3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:47.800]  i'm going to continue to say that he tried to incite violence and uh i'm going to continue
[3:03:47.800 --> 3:03:55.480]  to propagate lies on my pajama's website saying that the surge worked you think i'm kidding right
[3:03:55.480 --> 3:04:01.320]  everybody knows that the surge didn't work they just want more troops there but these phony neo
[3:04:01.320 --> 3:04:06.920]  cons will say anything to cow down to their globalist masters they love being lied to
[3:04:06.920 --> 3:04:11.080]  they love being part of what they think is the system that's there for them it ain't for you
[3:04:11.080 --> 3:04:16.200]  brother they're gonna keep you around you ain't the new media you're just like a husk of the old

[3:07:50.200 --> 3:07:56.120]  go check out my stuff i blog a little bit over at loose change 911.com i actually posted a little
[3:07:56.120 --> 3:08:01.720]  bit of my radio performance this week over there and there's also some great archive dnc stuff but
[3:08:01.720 --> 3:08:07.960]  if you want to see the live dnc stuff alex jones on command on demand as well i guess because you
[3:08:07.960 --> 3:08:12.280]  can watch the live stream where you can get the archive stuff it's over at info wars dot com right
[3:08:12.280 --> 3:08:18.440]  now for free you know we love to put out everything we do for free we want this information to get
[3:08:18.440 --> 3:08:24.120]  out we want as many people as possible to see our films hear our message and spread that word
[3:08:24.120 --> 3:08:29.560]  and that's what we're asking the listeners to do today is spread the word of truth and put these
[3:08:29.560 --> 3:08:34.680]  guys on the spot you know call the dallas morning news and let them know it is not okay to libel alex
[3:08:34.680 --> 3:08:41.960]  jones and say that he called for somebody's murder okay it's not cool and they should be held to the
[3:08:41.960 --> 3:08:47.560]  highest standards of journalism which obviously the mainstream media so they're not but they should
[3:08:47.560 --> 3:08:52.760]  have a retraction on the front page an apology on the front page and the guy should lose his job
[3:08:52.760 --> 3:08:58.040]  it's that simple it could be dealt with easily but you know the guy will probably keep his job
[3:08:58.040 --> 3:09:01.720]  and they'll probably test alex's patience i doubt they'll even print a retraction
[3:09:01.720 --> 3:09:06.120]  they're gonna end up getting sued into the ground but uh maybe uh the listeners here
[3:09:06.120 --> 3:09:10.520]  can forego that by calling up the dallas morning news all right i promise to take your calls
[3:09:10.520 --> 3:09:14.920]  and i intend to do so let's jump to judas in arizona judas what's on your mind
[3:09:14.920 --> 3:09:22.280]  hi uh jason i uh am a phd in political science and i listen to you hosting the show
[3:09:23.000 --> 3:09:30.840]  in june and to your warnings about possible false flags given the uh urban warfare drills
[3:09:30.840 --> 3:09:36.440]  that entire week i wrote an article about this that was picked up by jonathan and then made
[3:09:36.440 --> 3:09:44.200]  it to your website and they just today published part two and it argues along with you and alex
[3:09:44.200 --> 3:09:50.840]  that the dnc is being used uh to condition us to marshal off and to train security forces
[3:09:51.400 --> 3:09:56.440]  in implementing marshal off yeah i think it's more of a drill not not so much uh for the people but
[3:09:56.440 --> 3:10:00.520]  for the officers themselves they've been pretty well tempered over there but at the same time
[3:10:00.520 --> 3:10:05.960]  they're given gear and powers that they're usually not given such as the uh the canister mace which
[3:10:05.960 --> 3:10:10.040]  has been used and the rubber bullets they're not often used but yeah they're definitely
[3:10:10.040 --> 3:10:15.320]  conditioning us to accept these black uniforms all right well i wanted to give you the link for
[3:10:15.320 --> 3:10:20.840]  the new article both of my articles credit your work and i'm doing a a third article on the
[3:10:20.840 --> 3:10:27.080]  false flag truth movement in general and i'm going to be drawing on your new film and uh
[3:10:27.080 --> 3:10:31.400]  alex's truth rising excellent i just give you the link for the current one throw them out there
[3:10:31.400 --> 3:10:39.800]  sure okay well the easiest is to just google false flags for denver dnc and that'll give
[3:10:39.800 --> 3:10:46.040]  you part one and part two um or you can just go both flags for denver dnc part two and that
[3:10:46.040 --> 3:10:51.640]  links back to part one when you get to the article do you want the actual long-winded link or
[3:10:52.360 --> 3:10:58.120]  that's okay but we get it and i want to get your opinion you know outside of the uh police state
[3:10:58.120 --> 3:11:04.440]  and getting us ready for marshal law and uh all that what do you think of the quote-unquote protesters
[3:11:04.440 --> 3:11:13.000]  dressing up like clowns and magicians to levitate the mint i think that the entire country is then
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:19.960]  so dumbed down that the only way to get anybody's attention is to just act stupid frankly um other
[3:11:19.960 --> 3:11:25.240]  than that i don't know any deep-seated you know seated symbolism in any of it but i am i think
[3:11:25.240 --> 3:11:29.320]  it's just there to you know make us look like fools and any dissenter to look like a fool and
[3:11:29.320 --> 3:11:33.800]  unfortunately that is how you get media coverage is to dress up like a clown and say you're going
[3:11:33.800 --> 3:11:38.360]  to do the impossible when you know damn well you want to thank you for the call judith let us jump
[3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:45.640]  to darin in florida darin what's on your mind hey man i was just talking with the dallas
[3:11:45.640 --> 3:11:53.320]  morning news okay and they pointed me to the blog and so i went there and they pulled it down
[3:11:54.120 --> 3:12:00.680]  and i said you know due to uh some inaccuracy yada yada yada so now they're posting it on the
[3:12:00.680 --> 3:12:05.080]  website they finally are retracting it there on the website but we haven't reacted they haven't
[3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:10.280]  offered an apology of any kind and so and they haven't retracted it they just all they said was
[3:12:10.280 --> 3:12:16.760]  due to and inaccuracy they were not specific so that to me that's not a full retraction
[3:12:17.480 --> 3:12:21.080]  no absolutely not it doesn't even say which part of the article isn't correct they just
[3:12:21.080 --> 3:12:25.480]  brought the article but the thing is that we have it archived and we know so you know people

[3:12:34.280 --> 3:12:40.840]  i spoke to them and they said that uh it did not make the print that it was only on the
[3:12:40.840 --> 3:12:48.120]  blog and it was on the blog because of some guy by the name of mike hashi moto interesting and he's
[3:12:48.120 --> 3:12:54.680]  from pasadena california and if you google his name you can get his phone number and i'm gonna

[3:13:17.400 --> 3:13:21.640]  be able to restore the constitution of the bill rights in this country wow can you imagine
[3:13:21.640 --> 3:13:29.320]  it freedom of speech again no more free speech zones no that could never happen making it illegal to
[3:13:29.320 --> 3:13:34.600]  wiretap american citizens now that's not going to happen maybe we can push back the fact that they
[3:13:34.600 --> 3:13:40.120]  just introduced a new bill where law enforcement and the alphabet agencies are going to conduct
[3:13:40.120 --> 3:13:46.600]  investigations with homeland security on innocent americans and they're going to do dry interviews
[3:13:46.600 --> 3:13:52.600]  test interviews with your neighbors your friends your family and they're not going to represent
[3:13:52.600 --> 3:13:58.600]  themselves as government agencies or or uh you know federal workers they're just going to go up
[3:13:58.600 --> 3:14:01.960]  and start shooting the breeze and see what they can get out of somebody and then you're going to be
[3:14:01.960 --> 3:14:09.480]  in a database isn't that lovely isn't that great it's it's seriously so much like a stasi force or
[3:14:09.480 --> 3:14:17.800]  a gestapo in a new era in an era where we literally have the technology to broadcast live from denver
[3:14:18.440 --> 3:14:22.440]  you know free of charge through justin tv that's just me the commoner
[3:14:22.440 --> 3:14:27.000]  you know we're able to do that can you imagine the technology which is at the tips of the fingers of
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:33.320]  the elitists in this world of the shadow government of these special programs out in you know nevada
[3:14:33.320 --> 3:14:40.280]  and other parts of the desert i'm not talking ufo's and aliens folks i'm talking the real deal we got
[3:14:40.280 --> 3:14:47.720]  a we got a hydron collider warming up to shoot we got sound weapons we got chips for human beings
[3:14:51.720 --> 3:14:59.000]  i mean god when it's so hard to articulate how far we've come being you know i remember
[3:14:59.000 --> 3:15:03.640]  when it was cool when i was a kid that i could play a video game on a wrist roll wristwatch
[3:15:03.640 --> 3:15:11.640]  with an lcd monitor and like the the crappiest graphics you've ever seen now i could pick up my
[3:15:11.640 --> 3:15:18.600]  phone and i can play just about any video game from super nintendo genesis all the 16 bit systems
[3:15:18.600 --> 3:15:24.760]  and lower on my phone color awesome graphics doing whatever that's that's a minute point
[3:15:24.760 --> 3:15:31.640]  you know i i've got a gigabyte in my phone that is the size of my pinky nail that's how big that
[3:15:31.640 --> 3:15:37.800]  gigabyte is size my pinky now i can i can put hours and hours of video on that i have both loose
[3:15:37.800 --> 3:15:41.480]  changes on there i have my bary jennings interview on there i have world trade center seven falling
[3:15:41.480 --> 3:15:47.080]  on there and that doesn't even come close to filling up the gigabyte of space so we are in such a
[3:15:47.080 --> 3:15:54.520]  period of immense technology that these kind of spy forces these kind of actions are only
[3:15:54.520 --> 3:16:01.480]  going to create a hellish police state here at home one of the likes we have never seen before
[3:16:02.600 --> 3:16:10.200]  all right let's go to john in singapore johnny with us johnny still there yeah yeah can you hear me

[3:16:17.400 --> 3:16:26.440]  studying the whole uh all the videos on the michelle malkin and alex thing yep yep yeah yeah
[3:16:27.720 --> 3:16:32.840]  yeah there's you know like when you have alex i'm kind of disagree here or not disagree but i just
[3:16:33.400 --> 3:16:38.840]  it it's kind of i just want to make a constructed criticism it's kind of maybe you can talk to alex
[3:16:38.840 --> 3:16:45.080]  um it's kind of doesn't seem like it's he kind of goes off sometimes and exaggerates things
[3:16:45.720 --> 3:16:53.480]  and then makes our side kind of look discredited if he's not exactly accurate and saying things
[3:16:53.480 --> 3:16:59.320]  exactly the way they are and being very careful and maybe kind of doing the things that they're
[3:16:59.320 --> 3:17:02.440]  doing well what do you think you're exaggerating them up well what do you think one of the
[3:17:02.440 --> 3:17:07.880]  exaggerations is i'm gonna give you the floor go ahead okay um like well from the videos
[3:17:07.880 --> 3:17:16.680]  it's clear that that one uh geek in the green shirt with the uh joker hat on yep there was
[3:17:16.680 --> 3:17:21.960]  three of those frat boy types and the the worst one was the guy in the green shirt he's the one
[3:17:21.960 --> 3:17:27.560]  that was saying kill malkin and he's with the guy with the obama beret right yeah the other
[3:17:27.560 --> 3:17:32.680]  obama beret there's one of the other guys with him there's one other guy and sort of a camper hat
[3:17:32.680 --> 3:17:38.520]  kind of a thing those three guys and like alex is on it's it's not clear that they were with
[3:17:39.400 --> 3:17:45.000]  malkin okay it's clear that they were provocative tours and that they were they were acting like
[3:17:45.000 --> 3:17:48.600]  they were buddies without and it's clear that they weren't with him they were acting like they were
[3:17:48.600 --> 3:17:52.600]  buddies with him and then a minute later he's they're saying the guy in the green goes alex

[3:20:27.080 --> 3:20:32.680]  in martial law hello ted anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the federal reserve
[3:20:32.680 --> 3:20:37.720]  note and understand the risks of deficit spending therefore with catastrophic events it comes as
[3:20:37.720 --> 3:20:42.440]  no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[3:20:42.440 --> 3:20:47.000]  from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is
[3:20:47.000 --> 3:20:51.960]  held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending will skyrocket through fdic if the government
[3:20:51.960 --> 3:20:57.000]  is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy a current effort
[3:20:57.000 --> 3:21:02.200]  is underway by the fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors however
[3:21:02.200 --> 3:21:06.840]  an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation
[3:21:06.840 --> 3:21:11.400]  in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative portion of all
[3:21:11.400 --> 3:21:16.600]  investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver while paper investments currently have
[3:21:16.600 --> 3:21:22.280]  been driven by debt gold on its own has held value for over six thousand years for more information

[3:22:41.240 --> 3:22:45.560]  of religious worship and morality by legislation our forefathers wrote the bill of rights to
[3:22:45.560 --> 3:22:50.120]  guarantee all americans this freedom liberty of conscience history and the bible proved to them
[3:22:50.120 --> 3:22:54.680]  that these two systems church and state must be kept separate it must be our love of god
[3:22:54.680 --> 3:22:59.960]  and of country that prompts or constrains us this will change the character not civil enforcement
[3:22:59.960 --> 3:23:04.680]  from history we saw that when church and state united known as papal roam religious intolerance
[3:23:04.680 --> 3:23:09.560]  resulted this union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation america and

[3:24:11.960 --> 3:24:13.560]  all right it's the alex jones show
[3:24:13.560 --> 3:24:19.720]  oh i'm jason bermas sitting in for alex all week remember tomorrow is a big wrap up
[3:24:20.280 --> 3:24:25.000]  of the dnc's events we're going to be playing some of the stuff that didn't air that was on
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:31.480]  justin dot tv my interview with uh kevin ryan richard gauge alan wanton more if you missed
[3:24:31.480 --> 3:24:37.240]  anything from this week you're gonna want to tune in tomorrow and like i said we're gonna keep
[3:24:37.240 --> 3:24:41.800]  taking your calls i understand they're gonna be those of you that are critical of alex jones and
[3:24:41.800 --> 3:24:47.400]  i'm not saying not to be critical of those within the patriot movement myself you know alex but we
[3:24:47.400 --> 3:24:51.800]  are all human beings and we're not going to get everything a hundred percent right and none of
[3:24:51.800 --> 3:24:57.800]  us are perfect but i do think that alex has handled the situation in denver eloquently i think that he
[3:24:57.800 --> 3:25:05.560]  is done so in order to bring more people into the info war and i understand that some people
[3:25:05.560 --> 3:25:10.760]  don't like the confrontation approach some people don't like uh the getting in other people's faces
[3:25:10.760 --> 3:25:16.680]  approach that's fine go do it yourself then go do it your way no one's stopping you no one's stopping
[3:25:16.680 --> 3:25:22.120]  you from getting in your car right now grabbing your camcorder and asking someone a tough question
[3:25:22.120 --> 3:25:28.280]  in your own words in your own manner i have a slightly different style than jones that's fine
[3:25:28.280 --> 3:25:33.160]  i love jones' style i fell in love with jones all over again when i watched that first michelle
[3:25:33.160 --> 3:25:38.680]  malkin confrontation for the first time i couldn't i even my buddies my buddies got a hold of me they
[3:25:38.680 --> 3:25:44.360]  loved it too because they know what a monster what a little demon pig michelle malkin is she
[3:25:44.360 --> 3:25:50.120]  deserves you know no sympathy i'm not going to give randy and i hope you don't either out there
[3:25:50.760 --> 3:25:54.920]  it's just my opinion all right let's jump to frank in new york what's on your mind frank
[3:25:56.280 --> 3:26:06.120]  you with us frank that it's very sad that uh honest protest in political dissent at the
[3:26:06.120 --> 3:26:15.480]  national political conventions forces those that engage in discourse to be placed in sort of the
[3:26:15.480 --> 3:26:21.000]  you know behind the fence in the quote unquote free speech zones that are really very isolated
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:28.360]  from everything but i think it's very sad that uh alex was flandered and he has every legal right
[3:26:28.360 --> 3:26:33.960]  to seek remedy to adjudicate that and he may have to do that but what i wanted to mention
[3:26:33.960 --> 3:26:41.720]  is that i was kind of surprised watching uh bill clinton support for obama and hillary's
[3:26:41.720 --> 3:26:49.720]  piece but i wanted to let you know that in pakistan on monday the story with the uh birth
[3:26:49.720 --> 3:26:55.960]  certificate of obama from kenya was reproduced in the paper and today the washington times
[3:26:55.960 --> 3:27:03.160]  has an article regarding the uh philip berg's lawsuit about obama's eligibility for office
[3:27:03.880 --> 3:27:09.640]  and what do you think about the fact that hillary uh in a sense will probably run again
[3:27:09.640 --> 3:27:17.560]  and this will actually show when it comes out that uh sadly obama was not born in this country
[3:27:17.560 --> 3:27:21.400]  therefore he's an eligible to be president doesn't this say something to the world
[3:27:21.400 --> 3:27:27.560]  because everyone seems to be aware of this except the democrats and uh you know they're
[3:27:27.560 --> 3:27:32.120]  carrying on as if uh nothing is uh all right ordinary let me handle this one
[3:27:32.840 --> 3:27:36.520]  let's say it's true and i do believe it's true i i'm not a hundred percent because
[3:27:36.520 --> 3:27:40.440]  i don't have the documents i wasn't there when obama was born but uh the associated
[3:27:40.440 --> 3:27:44.360]  press is reporting that the documents are real like you said it's hitting washington times it's
[3:27:44.360 --> 3:27:50.120]  hitting pakistani international newspapers and wouldn't it be a thing if this doesn't come out
[3:27:50.120 --> 3:27:55.400]  at least in this media until the second year of his presidency or the third year of his presidency
[3:27:55.400 --> 3:27:59.960]  it doesn't hit mainline and then all of a sudden you have somebody who was born outside of this
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:05.240]  country who is the president of the united states now they'll probably sit there and go well
[3:28:05.800 --> 3:28:10.520]  jeez what are we gonna do about this we can't really impeach him let's amend the constitution
[3:28:10.520 --> 3:28:15.560]  boy it sure gives arnie an end doesn't it it gives any foreigner in it they'll say well look
[3:28:15.560 --> 3:28:20.120]  what a great job this guy's doing you know he's our president he's not from this country let's amend
[3:28:20.120 --> 3:28:26.040]  the constitution and a lot of people if he's as slick as clinton if the economy starts to go up
[3:28:26.040 --> 3:28:31.320]  if he's a smooth talker and we know he is he's a charismatic guy they may support that and it may

[3:33:13.080 --> 3:33:17.400]  older brother in goonies all right let's go to mike in texas for a comment what's up mike
[3:33:18.440 --> 3:33:25.800]  yeah uh well yesterday i was watching this invention i think it was on cnn and you know just
[3:33:26.600 --> 3:33:35.160]  this made me so sick to see all these people you know crazy uh obama and biden and you know
[3:33:35.800 --> 3:33:41.640]  people don't even bother to research you know the background of biden or anyone and it's just
[3:33:41.640 --> 3:33:46.600]  you know i guess just because oh obama picked him you know it's okay and i mean the only thing
[3:33:46.600 --> 3:33:51.480]  that made it better for me was when kassin is from up there and talked you know i have to imagine
[3:33:51.480 --> 3:33:57.400]  that uh oh did kassin speak at the dnc i missed that yeah he spoke you know he's pretty cool but
[3:33:57.400 --> 3:34:04.360]  what do you have to say um i kind of forgot you know i don't remember but he said you know just
[3:34:04.920 --> 3:34:10.600]  showing support for obama which i don't really get but because you know he said you know again
[3:34:10.600 --> 3:34:15.880]  he's like the only true one of the two men in congress they're him and ron paul but yeah he is
[3:34:15.880 --> 3:34:20.040]  really one of the only guys in congress i wish that he had not supported obama i must i would have
[3:34:20.040 --> 3:34:25.400]  much rather seen him at the uh ron paul convention that would be a lot nicer but then again he's a
[3:34:25.400 --> 3:34:29.400]  fan of ron paul you know he said that he likes his work and you know at one time would have
[3:34:29.400 --> 3:34:35.480]  considered uh being his running mate so continue yeah and um yeah well you know just want to see
[3:34:35.480 --> 3:34:41.880]  that and uh can we for that tom rollo interview yeah i'm excited to and uh i just want you to
[3:34:41.880 --> 3:34:48.520]  man just pray with me that we get a new age album in the future man just just hoping that comes out
[3:34:50.280 --> 3:34:54.360]  all right man i thank you for the call mike let's jump to the next caller let's go to
[3:34:54.360 --> 3:35:02.040]  jeremy in montana jeremy what's on your mind how's it going jason good man hey uh sorry to hear
[3:35:02.040 --> 3:35:07.640]  about the alex jones then but it sure is funny when michael reagan comes out and uh calls for
[3:35:07.640 --> 3:35:12.520]  all of our deaths you know and then uh then it's hilarious that's okay hundreds of thousands of
[3:35:12.520 --> 3:35:18.520]  people nothing gets printed or put on the internet about that except by us but soon as uh
[3:35:19.320 --> 3:35:24.440]  but they make stuff up about us all the time and it's ridiculous well he's also for uh taking
[3:35:24.440 --> 3:35:29.160]  muslim babies and shoving grenades in their bottom so they explode and die i mean that's the kind of
[3:35:29.160 --> 3:35:35.880]  sicko that mike reagan is right now i had one more quick comment about michelle you know her
[3:35:35.880 --> 3:35:41.000]  saying that uh for the first time in her life she's proud of this country i guess she doesn't
[3:35:41.000 --> 3:35:47.800]  do much history i guess she's not proud that uh the slaves got freed like a long time ago you
[3:35:47.800 --> 3:35:53.480]  know i hear you man go through history and uh count lots of things i'm proud of my country for
[3:35:53.480 --> 3:35:57.640]  but for the first time she's from maybe they should still be slaves i don't know they're not
[3:35:57.640 --> 3:36:04.280]  proud of she's not proud of it are you talking about malcolm so um who was that you're saying
[3:36:04.280 --> 3:36:10.040]  michelle michelle obama oh michelle obama well i i didn't meant i didn't see her speech but she's
[3:36:10.040 --> 3:36:16.280]  a cfr stew she's a total globalist i mean i i mean she doesn't she doesn't honestly i mean a lot of
[3:36:16.280 --> 3:36:20.600]  these political relationships too are just that they're just political relationships these people
[3:36:20.600 --> 3:36:24.360]  aren't married because they love each other they're married for an image you know i mean you look at
[3:36:24.360 --> 3:36:28.440]  john edwards and he had another chick on the side and probably has a love right these things never
[3:36:28.440 --> 3:36:32.840]  work out look at right now bill and hillary clinton that's a business relationship there's no love
[3:36:32.840 --> 3:36:37.880]  left in that you know except for maybe that of a brother and a sister type thing i mean they don't
[3:36:37.880 --> 3:36:43.400]  i mean come on vandy fairer reporting that that's a weird scenario brother and sister yeah well
[3:36:43.400 --> 3:36:47.560]  i mean more than but they have more of that affection towards each other i think than they
[3:36:47.560 --> 3:36:54.360]  would have had to several years ago jason at the black cat where's that in austin on the sixth street
[3:36:54.360 --> 3:36:58.680]  and now this is my first time out in austin man i've only been here since april and i drive back
[3:36:58.680 --> 3:37:04.760]  to new york today i thank you for the call uh we're gonna jump over to kyle in iowa kyle what's on
[3:37:04.760 --> 3:37:13.400]  your mind how's it going jason um i was listening earlier and uh you had commented about um how people
[3:37:13.400 --> 3:37:21.560]  will say well i can't make a difference well um i uh i really beg to differ uh you know i i'm a massage
[3:37:21.560 --> 3:37:26.360]  therapist and i'm i always have dvds on hand with me so uh you know i'm always giving them out to
[3:37:26.360 --> 3:37:30.600]  clients i maybe lost some but i gained some oil clients by doing it it doesn't really matter to me
[3:37:30.600 --> 3:37:37.480]  any um but the thing is is that uh out of all the people i've given dvds to i've come to find out
[3:37:37.480 --> 3:37:41.800]  you know after the fact later on that some of those people have taken those dvds i gave them
[3:37:41.800 --> 3:37:45.880]  made copies themselves and they've been handing them out exactly like it you know you just gotta
[3:37:45.880 --> 3:37:51.480]  you just gotta knock down the first domino yeah um it's antibodies fighting the virus is what it is
[3:37:51.480 --> 3:37:57.960]  yeah right um and and also to uh you're talking about how um you know how it's actually really
[3:37:57.960 --> 3:38:04.040]  low tech if you want to start making your own uh documentary films and things like that um i've
[3:38:04.040 --> 3:38:10.680]  made a couple myself i just made one uh i uh i called it it's on google video it's called nine

[3:38:15.800 --> 3:38:19.960]  got a name a couple other ones you've done because you know youtube warriors like yourself man all
[3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:23.880]  of us putting these films out they reach different people and you know there's different flavors
[3:38:23.880 --> 3:38:27.560]  for different folks some things affect others differently and like you said some of the people
[3:38:27.560 --> 3:38:31.560]  taking dvds from you are making copies and giving out dvds so what are some of the other videos
[3:38:31.560 --> 3:38:37.240]  you've put out um uh media propaganda and the 2008 election um i think that's a really important
[3:38:37.240 --> 3:38:43.240]  one for people to watch just to understand how we're being manipulated um fiat uh currency
[3:38:43.240 --> 3:38:47.640]  fools gold i actually uh and i actually added it in if you want to protect yourself go to

[3:41:01.080 --> 3:41:08.520]  eight seven uh one eight twenty yes that's the call in line into that radio into that radio show
[3:41:08.520 --> 3:41:12.680]  that's that's probably why it's so busy because you know he's he's fairly popular in ballast
[3:41:13.400 --> 3:41:16.920]  well that's why i gave out those alternate numbers so people could call up the newspapers
[3:41:16.920 --> 3:41:21.560]  and actually you know again be polite apparently they've pulled it from their blog i don't know
[3:41:21.560 --> 3:41:24.680]  whether they put it in the print or not they're denying they put it into print but if they put
[3:41:24.680 --> 3:41:30.040]  it into print i hope that one of the listeners out there takes it scans it and sends it over
[3:41:30.040 --> 3:41:35.800]  to tips at info wars dot com or erin at info wars dot com so we can get the hot a hard article up
[3:41:35.800 --> 3:41:40.280]  there and prove beyond a reasonable doubt that these these people are uh slandering alex jones
[3:41:40.280 --> 3:41:47.720]  i thank you for the calm on t let's jump to james in oregon james what's on your mind yo calling
[3:41:47.720 --> 3:41:52.520]  from the home of the latest d o d psi optare drills in portland oregon my boy actually
[3:41:52.520 --> 3:41:57.080]  called me the other night and told me all about him but why don't you go over for it so did you
[3:41:57.080 --> 3:42:01.480]  did you not cover these yeah i didn't know actually i didn't cover them on the show actually
[3:42:02.040 --> 3:42:07.560]  uh late night phone call with my friend who lives out in portland oregon and he was telling me how
[3:42:07.560 --> 3:42:12.040]  there was just crazy amount of military drills going on he was asking me if i knew about him
[3:42:12.040 --> 3:42:15.800]  and i was like no what can you tell me about me it's like well they look like domestic takeover
[3:42:15.800 --> 3:42:21.880]  drills but fill me in man that's i think pretty much what they are so fortunately i i've been
[3:42:21.880 --> 3:42:28.440]  posting everything i can find on my site media monarchy dot com and fortunately micro vero
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:34.760]  and also prison planet and ron paul war room and portland indy media and even unfortunately sites
[3:42:34.760 --> 3:42:42.840]  like stormfront uh have picked up my story so it's helping to go viral but it's basically black
[3:42:42.840 --> 3:42:48.360]  helicopters over portland for d o d tear drills and it's always you know given to you in the way
[3:42:48.360 --> 3:42:53.480]  of all don't worry and i heard the black car real attack i heard the black helicopters were everywhere
[3:42:53.480 --> 3:42:58.280]  man i heard it was just like ridiculous and my mom and my friend was just like i couldn't even believe
[3:42:58.280 --> 3:43:02.520]  it and he's like you've been showing me this stuff for so long i just wasn't even prepared to see it
[3:43:02.520 --> 3:43:10.200]  up close but he did continue and that i was kind of in the same spot i worked the night shift so i
[3:43:10.200 --> 3:43:14.840]  slept through it but later that evening i had people coming up to me saying so tell me about the
[3:43:14.840 --> 3:43:21.240]  drills and i had no idea but of course i talked to people about it enough to where they've now
[3:43:21.240 --> 3:43:27.640]  been keyed in on it portland is also the home of an unfortunate amount of tear drills from the top
[3:43:27.640 --> 3:43:34.120]  off drills to vigilant shield last year i think it puts a lot of us kind of on edge because
[3:43:34.120 --> 3:43:39.000]  exactly what are you training for and it's a beautiful area to live in by the way i visited
[3:43:39.000 --> 3:43:45.080]  there a couple summers ago hung out with my cousin and my friend i'm just i'm talking about now and
[3:43:45.080 --> 3:43:49.080]  you know i walked through downtown portland it's a it's a gorgeous area it's it's a really nice
[3:43:49.080 --> 3:43:54.840]  place people seem pretty open-minded uh we sold out our our theater showing of about 500 people
[3:43:54.840 --> 3:43:59.880]  i mean there seem to be a lot of well-meaning intelligent people there so it really is no
[3:43:59.880 --> 3:44:04.760]  wonder for me that they would drill up there number one because they might have some resistance
[3:44:04.760 --> 3:44:09.320]  in number two because it's a little more low-key than say a new york or california drill exactly
[3:44:09.320 --> 3:44:16.520]  and it is referred to by poppy bush as little bay roots from the greetings that the bush crime
[3:44:16.520 --> 3:44:23.640]  family got here many many years ago but basically there are you know cats out here like me and like
[3:44:23.640 --> 3:44:28.520]  alexan three who actually have an article up on this as well his radio show by the way i've been
[3:44:28.520 --> 3:44:32.360]  on it a couple times he's a really good guy absolutely absolutely and actually his television
[3:44:32.360 --> 3:44:38.760]  show was on tonight so he'll probably be going over these so we saw it in Denver a few weeks ago
[3:44:38.760 --> 3:44:44.520]  and now we see it in portland here so and we're going to take over our city yeah i am with you
[3:44:44.520 --> 3:44:49.640]  thank you so much for the call thank you brother you got it man yeah man they are it's it's real
[3:44:49.640 --> 3:44:54.680]  okay they were doing this before nine eleven check out alex jones's police state movies they're going
[3:44:54.680 --> 3:44:59.720]  to tell you it's for terrorism after the fact but this is for domestic takeover this is knocking
[3:44:59.720 --> 3:45:06.680]  talk you got any guns you got any weapons this is martial law in our country people in black
[3:45:06.680 --> 3:45:11.560]  uniforms are not your friends folks unmarked helicopters ain't your friends and when you know
[3:45:11.560 --> 3:45:16.520]  i'm so sick of hearing these mainline people go that's black helicopter stuff well you might as
[3:45:16.520 --> 3:45:21.400]  well be admitting to it right there because there's so many black helicopters on tape and on video
[3:45:21.400 --> 3:45:28.520]  and photographs it can't be denied any longer i mean the coverage we did on the dnc drills
[3:45:28.520 --> 3:45:34.680]  that happened two three months ago was incredible straight up showing you these black helicopters
[3:45:34.680 --> 3:45:40.920]  going from rooftop to rooftop with special forces in them throwing out american flags with
[3:45:40.920 --> 3:45:46.440]  little orange flair things and propaganda pamphlets and that's in our own country that's not in
[3:45:46.440 --> 3:45:51.880]  we're not taking over afghanistan now they're taking over denver craziness all right let's jump
[3:45:51.880 --> 3:45:57.720]  to michael in texas michael what's on your mind hey just uh... jason just want to let you know
[3:45:57.720 --> 3:46:03.880]  that i called uh... mark davis is uh... radio station wb ap and fort worth and uh... let them
[3:46:03.880 --> 3:46:09.560]  know about what he did everything uh... y'all can call the uh... operations manager over there
[3:46:09.560 --> 3:46:19.080]  tyler cox at eight one seven six nine five zero eight six one give that number out again
[3:46:19.080 --> 3:46:25.480]  eight one seven six nine five zero eight six one and when you call that number
[3:46:25.480 --> 3:46:29.560]  he's out of uh... town he's out of office till the second of september but
[3:46:29.560 --> 3:46:34.040]  get the operator just uh... punch in zero get the operator and you talk to david allen
[3:46:34.040 --> 3:46:40.440]  he's uh... filling in for him as the operations manager also mark davis is email address is
[3:46:40.440 --> 3:46:46.440]  m davis at wb ap dot com all right now what was the response to anybody actually address
[3:46:46.440 --> 3:46:51.320]  the situation or what uh... he was totally unaware what mark davis had done i had told
[3:46:51.320 --> 3:46:55.400]  him i said well you better get ready for a firestorm because alex jones has said that
[3:46:55.400 --> 3:46:59.320]  if he doesn't get a retraction because uh... michelle malkin's already admitted that
[3:46:59.320 --> 3:47:04.440]  alex didn't say you know to kill her and that the other provocateurs were not with alex
[3:47:04.440 --> 3:47:09.560]  jones and i said uh... you better get ready for a firestorm that uh... mark davis uh...
[3:47:09.560 --> 3:47:14.520]  doesn't cracked it and the dallas more news that retract their statements uh... then
[3:47:14.520 --> 3:47:19.080]  alex jones will probably too i said you you better check into this because obviously
[3:47:19.080 --> 3:47:22.760]  mark davis didn't look at any of the video tape before he shot his mouth off that's right
[3:47:22.760 --> 3:47:26.760]  he absolutely didn't i thank you for the call michael and i thank you for calling them up
[3:47:26.760 --> 3:47:29.880]  and letting them know that we're not just going to lie down we're not just going to
[3:47:29.880 --> 3:47:34.040]  take it we're not going to let you slander alex jones alex is not going to slander alex jones
[3:47:34.040 --> 3:47:37.480]  and you're not going to start saying that we're violent you're not going to start saying
[3:47:37.480 --> 3:47:41.400]  that we're trying to incite riots you're not going to start saying that uh...
[3:47:41.400 --> 3:47:45.640]  we're calling for people's deaths because we're not okay
[3:47:45.640 --> 3:47:49.800]  we want a fair trial for a lot of these people
[3:47:49.800 --> 3:47:54.360]  let's let's get the facts and have trials for people like dick cheney
[3:47:54.360 --> 3:47:57.880]  for propagandists like bill o'reilly and especially michelle malkin she knows what
[3:47:57.880 --> 3:47:59.640]  she's doing
[3:47:59.640 --> 3:48:03.240]  she probably wasn't bought until after the fact in nine eleven she wrote that one
[3:48:03.240 --> 3:48:07.320]  uh... decent uh... article about six months after questioning the attacks
[3:48:07.320 --> 3:48:11.480]  uh... some of the stuff that she questions in their i report on in fabled enemies but uh...
[3:48:11.480 --> 3:48:13.320]  totally lost total pig demon
[3:48:13.320 --> 3:48:14.920]  total neocon liar
[3:48:14.920 --> 3:48:20.520]  and uh... really the the propaganda over at the blogs that she supports is just
[3:48:20.520 --> 3:48:24.360]  it's vomitus it's it's it to say the least it's totally and completely
[3:48:24.360 --> 3:48:25.240]  disgusting it
[3:48:25.240 --> 3:48:27.880]  on nerves me to even think about it
[3:48:27.880 --> 3:48:31.720]  all right let's jump to jim in new york jim what's on your mind
[3:48:31.720 --> 3:48:33.520]  uh... jason uh...
[3:48:33.520 --> 3:48:37.680]  first i want to say uh... i try to call it dot a dollar sir morning news
[3:48:37.680 --> 3:48:41.240]  and i got the switchboard operator and i went through all the numbers on that on
[3:48:41.240 --> 3:48:42.840]  the article on the site
[3:48:42.840 --> 3:48:43.880]  on your site
[3:48:43.880 --> 3:48:46.080]  and uh... i got a lot
[3:48:46.080 --> 3:48:49.320]  you know mailboxes that were full of this stuff so i don't know what anybody
[3:48:49.320 --> 3:48:50.320]  else is getting
[3:48:50.320 --> 3:48:53.440]  so must be a lot of you know a lot of people uh... calling into a
[3:48:53.440 --> 3:48:55.880]  they probably in the phones off the hook by this point
[3:48:55.880 --> 3:48:57.120]  that probably
[3:48:57.120 --> 3:48:57.960]  but uh...
[3:48:57.960 --> 3:49:01.240]  what i want to say is that i want to commend you you know you're a young guy
[3:49:01.240 --> 3:49:04.080]  and i've been at this for thirty two years and uh...
[3:49:04.080 --> 3:49:08.040]  you seem to i'm amazed at the way and i'm you know i'm not blowing you up here
[3:49:08.040 --> 3:49:08.640]  but
[3:49:08.640 --> 3:49:11.720]  you have a man that the way you got your hands around this thing you know
[3:49:11.720 --> 3:49:15.160]  and it took me i'm about the first book i've read was uh...
[3:49:15.160 --> 3:49:18.600]  uh... sentence wall street the bolshevik revolution
[3:49:18.600 --> 3:49:20.960]  and it got me very angry when i read it
[3:49:20.960 --> 3:49:23.400]  and i say this because
[3:49:23.400 --> 3:49:25.760]  when i talk to be i was in Manhattan today
[3:49:25.760 --> 3:49:27.800]  and uh... i have some medical issues
[3:49:27.800 --> 3:49:31.040]  and i was talking to a nurse there and i start to become impatient you know
[3:49:31.040 --> 3:49:32.240]  because she wouldn't
[3:49:32.240 --> 3:49:33.320]  you know the what
[3:49:33.320 --> 3:49:35.400]  is the obvious to me today
[3:49:35.400 --> 3:49:38.080]  wasn't so obvious to her she's but she's uh...
[3:49:38.080 --> 3:49:39.880]  receptive
[3:49:39.880 --> 3:49:43.960]  not all the way you know and sometimes it takes such a long time it's an
[3:49:43.960 --> 3:49:44.880]  evolution
[3:49:44.880 --> 3:49:46.640]  and i look back at my own life
[3:49:46.640 --> 3:49:47.800]  uh... with this thing
[3:49:47.800 --> 3:49:49.840]  just how evil these people are
[3:49:49.840 --> 3:49:52.640]  a couple of coolers ago the guy said uh...
[3:49:52.640 --> 3:49:56.200]  one of those that he was surprised something affected the paraphrase that
[3:49:56.200 --> 3:49:57.560]  he was surprised
[3:49:57.560 --> 3:50:01.480]  but they would do this to alex you know and i said to myself you know he must
[3:50:01.480 --> 3:50:05.040]  must be doing it too long because nothing surprises me with these people
[3:50:05.040 --> 3:50:07.640]  yeah i mean they literally had gary tallis
[3:50:07.640 --> 3:50:09.880]  out there to protest lora bush
[3:50:09.880 --> 3:50:13.600]  and he gets beat up by some guy and they actually charge him
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:17.000]  with attacking a crippled girl in a wheelchair with cerebral palsy i don't
[3:50:17.000 --> 3:50:20.440]  put anything past these people i thank you for the call jim will be back in the

[3:54:22.760 --> 3:54:25.880]  sheeple and chattel the other day but that's how they look at us man
[3:54:25.880 --> 3:54:29.640]  like we're sheeple like we deserve what we get by

[3:54:41.720 --> 3:54:45.400]  hello yes sir hey how you doing man it's a
[3:54:45.400 --> 3:54:50.280]  real honor to speak to you right now and uh i just wanted to read some real
[3:54:50.280 --> 3:54:54.920]  quick for everybody this is from a 1990
[3:54:54.920 --> 3:54:59.640]  encyclopedia dictionary this is ground zero the definition
[3:54:59.640 --> 3:55:04.120]  it says the exact point where a bomb strikes the ground
[3:55:04.120 --> 3:55:10.920]  or in a nuclear explosion the area directly above or below the center of
[3:55:10.920 --> 3:55:15.560]  radiation ground zero is considered as the area
[3:55:15.560 --> 3:55:21.720]  of greatest destruction okay and when i first read that out my dictionary i
[3:55:21.720 --> 3:55:25.880]  couldn't believe it i got these dictionaries when i was a kid
[3:55:25.880 --> 3:55:30.520]  and uh that's like a smoking gun to me what you feel like that's a
[3:55:30.520 --> 3:55:33.240]  that's a parallel to the world trade center and why they called that ground
[3:55:33.240 --> 3:55:36.680]  zero yes exactly and that makes me want to know
[3:55:36.680 --> 3:55:41.320]  like who exactly came up with the term ground zero because
[3:55:41.320 --> 3:55:46.040]  if i had it in my dictionary that was 11 years before 9-11
[3:55:46.040 --> 3:55:49.800]  i mean somebody knows something about let me hit you hit you up with something
[3:55:49.800 --> 3:55:52.040]  a little bit even maybe more deeper and
[3:55:52.040 --> 3:55:56.040]  esoteric uh you know that the Rockefellers put those up right
[3:55:56.040 --> 3:56:00.760]  okay well do you know about the masonic rituals of building up towers and then
[3:56:00.760 --> 3:56:05.080]  bringing them down no i really don't know i don't know
[3:56:05.080 --> 3:56:09.160]  listen just check out the masonic rituals and you think your mind is
[3:56:09.160 --> 3:56:12.120]  blown by the by the ground zero thing i don't like to
