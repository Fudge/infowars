[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:31.960]  there are many areas of Europe inside places like Brussels Belgium and other
[00:31.960 --> 00:37.920]  ghettos inside France where you're not supposed to go if you're a Westerner well
[00:37.920 --> 00:44.520]  Joe Biggs Michael Zimmerman and of course Paul Joseph Watson today went into one of
[00:44.520 --> 00:52.680]  those ghettos in Brussels Belgium that is reportedly the heart of the ISIS base
[00:52.680 --> 00:59.200]  in Europe so our reporters were inside the ISIS base in Europe and they were
[00:59.200 --> 01:03.680]  told in shops in restaurants on the streets you get out of here and screamed
[01:03.680 --> 01:09.000]  at in Arabic French and in broken English so they traveled just about an
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.720]  hour and a half north from Paris into Brussels Belgium across the border there
[01:14.720 --> 01:20.240]  in the city of Brussels inside Belgium and boy let me tell you I think we
[01:20.240 --> 01:24.240]  should bring in more of these immigrants so that they can scream at us and tell
[01:24.240 --> 01:27.440]  us we're not welcome and the politically correct can tell us that they
[01:27.440 --> 01:36.240]  need to be worshipped this is wild wild wild wild and they didn't even know it
[01:36.240 --> 01:40.120]  was going to be this intense so I've told them go back if they choose to they
[01:40.120 --> 01:43.960]  think they say big things is too dangerous and actually get footage of
[01:43.960 --> 01:48.520]  this I mean how dramatic is that people coming out of shops you name it and
[01:48.520 --> 01:52.640]  saying you're not welcome get out of here because they're white they think
[01:52.640 --> 02:00.640]  they're European they're screaming at them in Arabic in French I guess what
[02:00.640 --> 02:08.680]  they speak in Belgium Flemish just a bunch of gibbering in different languages I
[02:09.400 --> 02:15.120]  tell you I'm really tempted now to get on an airplane myself I mean I was
[02:15.120 --> 02:18.360]  really talking about going to cover in the UN summit next month in Paris and I
[02:18.360 --> 02:25.000]  just I'm sorry I just it's just crazy this needs to be documented they say
[02:25.000 --> 02:28.960]  there's no police for miles and miles and we know this is in the news and
[02:28.960 --> 02:33.240]  European women are just grabbed off the street drug back in and gang raped and
[02:33.240 --> 02:37.680]  the police will do nothing they will not even charge the people that do it from
[02:37.680 --> 02:42.600]  Belgium to Sweden to France man the people running Europe really do hate
[02:42.600 --> 02:46.400]  Europe they really do want to suicide it but let me tell you hate Europe more
[02:46.400 --> 02:51.160]  the Europeans they want to hide out and be politically correct and think all
[02:51.160 --> 03:02.400]  this is going to blow over it's not socialism really is suicide Brussels
[03:02.400 --> 03:07.240]  where you can buy for 500 euros a gun in 30 minutes has become Europe's jihad
[03:07.240 --> 03:15.920]  capital that's right reporters inside ISIS base Europe that's what it is and so
[03:15.920 --> 03:20.800]  I want the guys to obviously tomorrow rent a car go around and surveil this and
[03:20.800 --> 03:27.640]  just show people what's going on big said they were getting there their cars
[03:27.640 --> 03:32.960]  were following them I mean this has been taken over and imagine the arrogance of
[03:32.960 --> 03:36.720]  these jihadis that usually are chopping and murdering and killing each other in
[03:36.720 --> 03:40.720]  their own respective countries and bullying women and blowing up churches
[03:40.720 --> 03:46.760]  now they're in the middle of Europe with just Europeans falling down to worship
[03:46.760 --> 03:59.320]  them absolutely falling down on their faces to grovel and it's the same thing
[03:59.320 --> 04:04.760]  here whether you're from China or Mexico or Eastern Europe or ever the case is
[04:04.760 --> 04:09.320]  we're supposed to just grovel and here's everything free and we're sorry we're so
[04:09.320 --> 04:14.840]  bad what a mind control screw job has been put into the average American
[04:14.840 --> 04:20.280]  screwed-up brain we come back we're going to intro the piece out of the break
[04:20.280 --> 04:24.600]  with a John Bowne report on all this and then we're going to get into all the
[04:24.600 --> 04:31.480]  huge breaking news today there is just so much but they're saying more terror
[04:31.480 --> 04:35.480]  attacks a new 9-11 race for that and then when there's a new 9-11 no one will
[04:35.480 --> 04:38.480]  get in trouble in our criminal governments for opening the borders up and
[04:38.480 --> 04:42.760]  allowing it to happen it really is the suspension of common sense and reality
[04:42.760 --> 04:48.280]  it really is totally sick we've got new black lives matter videos as they
[04:48.280 --> 04:53.160]  descend on Dartmouth students screaming racial apathats at people I mean it is
[04:53.160 --> 04:56.800]  just the suicide of everything that's common sense it is madness it has left
[04:56.800 --> 05:03.200]  us evil CIA boss John Brennan said Monday violating the Fourth Amendment and
[05:03.200 --> 05:07.560]  eliminating the privacy of virtually every American will be required if the
[05:07.560 --> 05:12.000]  United States hopes to stop the attacks by the Islamic State he said recent
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.080]  proposed NSA reforms and a return to the principles enshrined in the
[05:16.080 --> 05:20.320]  Constitution will make our ability collectively internationally to find
[05:20.320 --> 05:24.600]  these terrorists much more challenging I would anticipate this is not the only
[05:24.600 --> 05:29.520]  operation ISIL has in the pipeline Brennan said and remarks delivered at the
[05:29.520 --> 05:33.880]  Center for Strategic and International Studies during the Intelligence and
[05:33.880 --> 05:40.400]  National Security Summit in September officials from the FBI CIA NSA NGO
[05:40.400 --> 05:46.320]  DIA and NRO decried the deep cynicism of American people over surveillance
[05:46.320 --> 05:50.200]  Brennan attributed this to a misunderstanding between the American

[08:40.040 --> 08:45.160]  president Obama declared ISIS is creating strength aren't they well I don't
[08:45.160 --> 08:49.160]  think they're gaining strength what is true is is that from the start our goal
[08:49.160 --> 08:54.160]  has been first to contain and we have containment was this just an obvious
[08:54.160 --> 08:58.680]  example of the United States constant failure of war on terror related
[08:58.680 --> 09:03.080]  intelligence or did Obama make this declaration to his minion George
[09:03.080 --> 09:08.080]  Stephanopoulos to distance himself further from the administration's ties to
[09:08.080 --> 09:11.920]  the Frankenstein monster that recently claimed to have bombed a Russian
[09:11.920 --> 09:16.680]  airliner over the Sinai Peninsula and would be staging a massive terror event
[09:16.680 --> 09:22.120]  in Paris the very next day Obama ensured the American people that ISIS had been
[09:22.120 --> 09:27.280]  contained horrible leadership immediately disrupted as a terror suspect
[09:27.280 --> 09:32.080]  arrested in Paris during the attacks claimed he was from the Islamic State
[09:32.080 --> 09:37.600]  and ISIS later praised the attacks on Twitter oh crusaders we're coming to you
[09:37.600 --> 09:43.960]  with bombs and rifles wait for us the alleged ISIS tweet read before France's
[09:43.960 --> 09:48.320]  decision to seal its borders Friday in response to the Paris terrorist attacks
[09:48.320 --> 09:52.960]  the country was only willing to enact border control to protect politicians
[09:52.960 --> 09:58.920]  attending a UN climate change summit in other words the elite will erect walls
[09:58.920 --> 10:03.280]  to protect themselves from radical Islamic terrorists but they'll let the
[10:03.280 --> 10:07.720]  population fend for themselves and unfortunately this very attitude
[10:07.720 --> 10:11.960]  created the conditions the terrorists needed to launch multiple attacks in
[10:11.960 --> 10:16.640]  Paris there were at least seven separate attacks which were apparently planned
[10:16.640 --> 10:21.320]  to strike public events with a large number of people around a hundred people
[10:21.320 --> 10:25.880]  were violently massacred at the Patakalon concert hall during a hostage
[10:25.880 --> 10:30.640]  siege at least another 40 people had died in the other places around Paris
[10:30.640 --> 10:35.920]  police arrested one terrorist suspect who told them he was with the Islamic State
[10:35.920 --> 10:41.160]  and reportedly from Syria although it's likely the US and NATO will use the
[10:41.160 --> 10:46.240]  Paris attacks as an excuse to launch military operations in Syria the Pentagon
[10:46.240 --> 10:52.440]  admitted in 2012 that NATO was backing Islamic extremists in a proxy war to
[10:52.440 --> 10:57.360]  topple Syrian president Bashar al-Assad the Salafist the Muslim Brotherhood and
[10:57.360 --> 11:02.800]  al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria the
[11:02.800 --> 11:08.440]  Pentagon documents stated the West Gulf countries and Turkey support this
[11:08.440 --> 11:14.760]  opposition while Russia China and Iran support the Assad regime ISIS grew
[11:14.760 --> 11:20.600]  directly out of al-Qaeda in Iraq when the latter gained territory in Syria in
[11:20.600 --> 11:26.200]  2013 the questions regarding the attacks is retaliation of the assassination of
[11:26.200 --> 11:32.200]  jihadi John are on a constant mainstream media loop however verification of jihadi
[11:32.200 --> 11:37.840]  John's assassination remains and will remain a mystery yet it serves to raise
[11:37.840 --> 11:43.560]  Obama's commander-in-chief status exactly as did the Osama bin Laden
[11:43.560 --> 11:48.720]  assassination hoax if you want a conspiracy theory to exist that's how
[11:48.720 --> 11:54.880]  you start it the most elusive character on the face of the planet the most
[11:54.880 --> 12:00.080]  elusive human being the big foot of people and you catch him and kill him
[12:00.080 --> 12:05.160]  but yeah we we chucked him in the drink right away because we didn't want any
[12:05.160 --> 12:10.280]  more problems John bound for influence.com
[12:21.040 --> 12:25.920]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us we are now a good 12
[12:25.920 --> 12:29.720]  minutes into this worldwide broadcast that was a special report and followed
[12:29.720 --> 12:33.440]  by John bound for info wars nightly news last night I thought we'd open up the
[12:33.440 --> 12:38.600]  main transmission with that it has been reported that Brussels Belgium is
[12:38.600 --> 12:45.560]  Europe's terror capital and is the capital of ISIS operations well it's
[12:45.560 --> 12:50.160]  only about an hour and a half away from Paris so Joe Biggs Paul Joseph Watson
[12:50.160 --> 12:57.760]  and of course Michael Zimmerman drove from Paris this morning into Brussels
[12:57.760 --> 13:02.320]  Belgium and they got out in one of the areas reportedly controlled by the
[13:02.320 --> 13:06.280]  Islamist and we're told on the street we're told in businesses we're told in
[13:06.280 --> 13:12.400]  restaurants we're told in stores get out of here you're not welcome this is not
[13:12.400 --> 13:18.920]  for you in Arabic in in French in Dutch it appears in broken English
[13:18.920 --> 13:22.040]  cream debt you'll get out of here get out of here waving the arms you leave
[13:22.040 --> 13:30.840]  followed by cars basically run out of there so this is what goes on in Europe
[13:30.840 --> 13:36.040]  and this is what they want to create more of oh see they're not liberal they're
[13:36.040 --> 13:42.720]  not inclusive they're not open arms and this is where the reported attackers
[13:42.720 --> 13:48.240]  came from and the police won't even go into these areas so I want the guys to
[13:48.240 --> 13:51.480]  go in there undercover with a rent car with the cabs or whatever and get more
[13:51.480 --> 13:56.520]  footage of this just to detail because those are powerful images for people to
[13:56.520 --> 14:01.120]  understand exactly what's unfolding they've got some video but I want to be
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.040]  able to have people actually see this for themselves because this isn't the
[14:05.040 --> 14:09.040]  big melting pot they want here in the United States Canada Australia and then
[14:09.040 --> 14:16.080]  in Europe this is bizarre leftist policies held bent on bringing in
[14:16.080 --> 14:20.880]  radicalized groups from third-world countries that are living in the dark
[14:20.880 --> 14:28.040]  ages that other Muslims flee from who don't want to live under this and it's a
[14:28.040 --> 14:40.200]  very very dangerous situation obviously now the news websites info wars calm and
[14:40.200 --> 14:44.720]  present planet calm have got a lot of the angles covered so does drugs report
[14:44.720 --> 14:51.960]  calm but there is just so much to get to here all these different angles we have
[14:51.960 --> 14:59.240]  Syrian refugees already missing in Louisiana resettlement group admits we
[14:59.240 --> 15:04.320]  don't track them UN demands take them in tells Europe do it must be done
[15:04.320 --> 15:11.000]  plane load arrives in Britain French police in nationwide raids half of

[15:55.600 --> 16:05.800]  Israel outlaws domestic Islamic movement as police raid offices so that's some of
[16:05.800 --> 16:18.400]  the news that's up on drugs report calm info wars calm prison planet calm but
[16:18.400 --> 16:22.560]  Obama is saying that the number of refugees from Syria and elsewhere will
[16:22.560 --> 16:27.240]  be increased to ten thousand excuse me one hundred thousand per year and we
[16:27.240 --> 16:30.280]  always knew it go a hundred thousand two hundred thousand three hundred thousand
[16:30.280 --> 16:34.320]  actually a month ago they said a hundred thousand and then they said three
[16:34.320 --> 16:37.880]  hundred thousand and the number in the media was ten thousand again it's
[16:37.880 --> 16:42.440]  hundreds of thousands it's millions it's whatever we will put up with that's the
[16:42.440 --> 16:47.760]  limit of the tyranny now the French president is saying they must get rid of
[16:47.760 --> 16:52.000]  their bill of rights and Constitution and basically have a total police state to
[16:52.000 --> 16:59.640]  counter the threat they've brought in that they won't even deal with this is
[16:59.640 --> 17:12.200]  simply mind-blowing absolutely over-the-top mind-blowing to have this
[17:12.200 --> 17:24.280]  level of twisted bizarre out-of-the-open craziness but it's not craziness this is
[17:24.280 --> 17:28.520]  the divide and conquer strategy we talked so much about a tower of Babel
[17:28.520 --> 17:33.320]  with the Black Lives Matter group running around complaining and you know
[17:33.320 --> 17:36.440]  the radical Islamist system the feminist feminist running around and
[17:36.440 --> 17:39.600]  complaining and all the occultist complaining and pulling down crosses
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.760]  across the country and trying to ban Christmas and pushing for freebies for
[17:44.760 --> 17:51.680]  anybody they can get here in all the big drug companies above the law able to
[17:51.680 --> 17:58.800]  charge a two thousand percent price hike on infant seizure drug forced
[17:58.800 --> 18:15.960]  inoculations nanotech GMO it goes on and on and on and it shakes the mind to
[18:15.960 --> 18:24.440]  think about the fact that we have gotten to this point it absolutely just makes
[18:24.440 --> 18:32.560]  me wonder what's coming next but it's because the average person watches
[18:32.560 --> 18:38.960]  more than five hours of TV a day pop culture they're removed from the land
[18:38.960 --> 18:46.120]  they're removed from common-sense decisions they have no idea how the world
[18:46.120 --> 18:51.320]  really works they are completely naive and all they've been taught to hate is
[18:51.320 --> 18:59.680]  masculinity sovereignty private property the family productivity
[18:59.680 --> 19:06.640]  responsibility the right to self-defense they really believe whatever the mainstream
[19:06.640 --> 19:14.400]  media says and they think it's cute and they think it's fun to have their
[19:14.400 --> 19:21.640]  future destroyed they think it's cute to have foreign banks that own insurance
[19:21.640 --> 19:26.280]  companies pass Obamacare to triple prices and to create death panels and to

[25:35.200 --> 25:41.000]  compound areas where welfare is paid where health care is paid and where
[25:41.000 --> 25:50.440]  Europeans including the police dare not even enter now you talk about a plan to
[25:50.440 --> 25:55.880]  take over Europe you talk about a plan to wreck civilization this is it and
[25:55.880 --> 26:03.680]  it's done by the unmentionably bad scum like George Soros who lives out in a
[26:03.680 --> 26:11.720]  farm on thousands acres in a giant mansion in Connecticut they just have
[26:11.720 --> 26:19.480]  total bad will for the West it's a conquering of the West it's a mutilating
[26:19.480 --> 26:26.640]  of the West and here's French news agency UN warns Europe against back
[26:26.640 --> 26:33.560]  tracking on migrant communities an estimated 1.1 million migrants have
[26:33.560 --> 26:38.920]  landed in Europe and that's a whitewash number it's over 2 million this year
[26:38.920 --> 26:45.800]  other numbers show they're almost all men military age and man they don't have a
[26:45.800 --> 26:50.320]  complex that they're they're asking for something for free they're angry they
[26:50.320 --> 26:55.880]  hate the West on average and they are just filled with abject anger towards
[26:55.880 --> 27:01.800]  towards Europe they've been filled with leftist Ford Foundation style
[27:01.800 --> 27:08.800]  ideologies when we come back from break our reporters are on the ground it's an
[27:08.800 --> 27:15.560]  hour and a half from Paris in Brussels Belgium the admitted capital of radical
[27:15.560 --> 27:21.160]  Islam the capital of jihad the capital of ISIS in Europe and exactly what we'd
[27:21.160 --> 27:27.600]  read in the press is true if you're three European men sure they're from
[27:27.600 --> 27:35.240]  America but they're European derivation you do not enter you do not come in and
[27:35.240 --> 27:40.400]  one of these supposed attackers was reportedly saved out of the Mediterranean
[27:40.400 --> 27:45.160]  Ocean off the coast of Greece he was saved by the Greece people he was taken
[27:45.160 --> 27:49.640]  in and this is how Europeans are repaid and sure there's the argument well we
[27:49.640 --> 27:53.160]  bombed their countries we did this to him yes the criminals that are opening
[27:53.160 --> 27:57.360]  our borders and engineering the class of civilizations are the ones that have
[27:57.360 --> 28:01.040]  gone in and toppled any secular government and any government that tried
[28:01.040 --> 28:04.960]  to industrialize and tried to build up those nations whether it was Egypt
[28:04.960 --> 28:09.840]  whether it was Libya whether it was Syria whether it was Iraq your absolute
[28:09.840 --> 28:15.000]  or or Iran in 1953 with Mohammed Mosaddek you're absolutely right but it
[28:15.000 --> 28:20.040]  isn't Europeans that did it the same globalist that want us wrecked want them
[28:20.040 --> 28:25.400]  wrecked and that's the point they're going to create a bunch of Islamophobia
[28:25.400 --> 28:28.600]  they're going to bomb a bunch of Muslim countries ones that haven't even been
[28:28.600 --> 28:34.280]  involved in this they're going after Assad who's been fighting it then they're
[28:34.280 --> 28:41.160]  going to turn around in our face and tell us we have to give up our liberties
[28:41.160 --> 28:46.160]  and our freedoms to counter the threat they helped engineer by the way we have

[34:49.040 --> 34:54.920]  reporters are all on the ground not in Paris as they were the last two days but
[34:54.920 --> 35:02.120]  now across the border to the north in Brussels Belgium now Brussels Belgium is
[35:02.120 --> 35:08.120]  the admitted capital of ISIS in Europe it is the admitted capital of jihad in
[35:08.120 --> 35:13.200]  Europe it is the admitted place where the reported terrorist organized and
[35:13.200 --> 35:22.520]  launched their attacks that we saw on Friday the 13th large areas of Brussels
[35:22.520 --> 35:29.560]  are off-limits to Europeans the police will not even enter it only the
[35:29.560 --> 35:34.960]  socialist social workers arrive with the free welfare the free health care and
[35:34.960 --> 35:45.400]  they tend like mother mother hints they tend the eggs lovingly and the national
[35:45.400 --> 35:50.520]  leaders bring in the record numbers of Islamists to swell the ranks full of
[35:50.520 --> 35:57.360]  Western anti-Christian hatred forging the sword that the communist and the
[35:57.360 --> 36:04.320]  socialists will use to finally decapitate Europe so this is a match made in hell
[36:04.320 --> 36:14.000]  with a vandalistic lust a piratical lust to conquer Europe they know
[36:14.000 --> 36:18.560]  nationalist parties are taking over they know common sense is kicking back in
[36:18.560 --> 36:23.960]  they know libertarian ideas are growing in popularity under the UKIP party and
[36:23.960 --> 36:31.360]  others just mainline libertarian common sense nationalistic groups you've heard
[36:31.360 --> 36:36.000]  them on total common sense but the media calls them super right-wing extremist
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.280]  well the public's turning against that so there's a move to fully break the
[36:40.280 --> 36:46.360]  countries open the borders and ban demonstrations in Sweden in Belgium in
[36:46.360 --> 36:54.080]  France in Germany against the open borders and now France is announcing
[36:54.080 --> 36:58.800]  basically martial law civil emergency 5,000 troops patrolling with machine
[36:58.800 --> 37:02.000]  guns on the streets of Paris our reporters are going to be covering that
[37:02.000 --> 37:09.760]  tomorrow as well but this is the beginning of the accelerated flood into
[37:09.760 --> 37:17.280]  Western nations and we will see if they can use the control corporate press to
[37:17.280 --> 37:24.760]  spin this and force us to not just put up with groups that are absolutely
[37:24.760 --> 37:29.120]  incompatible with a free society but we're going to see if they're going to
[37:29.120 --> 37:32.520]  make us pay for it all which they're already doing
[37:32.520 --> 37:38.520]  France has launched airstrikes against Islamic State stronghold in Syria
[37:38.520 --> 37:42.800]  hmm funny a couple years ago you put this very group in charge there to murder
[37:42.800 --> 37:48.000]  everybody same groups you brought in to attack your own people we're going to
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.600]  decipher exactly what's happening Joe Biggs joins us from Brussels Belgium at

[38:05.560 --> 38:08.440]  believed his report was credible this of course originally came from judicial
[38:08.440 --> 38:13.040]  watch he wasn't even concerned about that but Joe who was in a Afghanistan
[38:13.040 --> 38:17.120]  and Iraq combat tours did say for security they had to pull out of the
[38:17.120 --> 38:22.640]  ghetto area there in Brussels Belgium and to break down exactly what happened is
[38:22.640 --> 38:26.520]  Joe Biggs they were followed by cars they were screamed at they weren't
[38:26.520 --> 38:31.160]  welcome going into restaurants and businesses Joe Biggs this sounds like
[38:31.160 --> 38:36.480]  that this is worse than we thought exactly that is completely correct Alex
[38:36.480 --> 38:40.640]  just moments ago we're in Molenbeek Belgium which is about a 40 minute walk
[38:40.640 --> 38:45.800]  outside of Brussels and in that area we went to the location of where the
[38:45.800 --> 38:51.320]  Belgian special forces conducted a raid and they actually got the mastermind of
[38:51.320 --> 38:56.280]  the Paris attack to happen on Friday the 13th and we were in that area doing some
[38:56.280 --> 39:00.480]  reports and as we decided to leave because of the rain we were followed by
[39:00.480 --> 39:09.280]  cars we had a car with three younger males probably ages 20 to 25 screaming
[39:10.240 --> 39:18.080]  it's breaking up stop Joe you start back over again reporting from Belgium
[39:18.080 --> 39:21.640]  right now outside France by an hour and a half from Paris your skype back please
[39:21.640 --> 39:27.120]  continue yes so we we walked away from the where the raid happened after we did
[39:27.120 --> 39:30.760]  two or three reports and we started trying to get out of the rain so we
[39:30.760 --> 39:34.600]  were going to walk into a business and as we walked in there was a whole bunch
[39:34.600 --> 39:38.560]  of Muslim men and basically we were told hey you're not welcome here get the
[39:38.560 --> 39:43.600]  hell out of here was this a restaurant a store it was like a restaurant yes so
[39:43.600 --> 39:47.800]  you told me to make that clear yeah definitely our white privilege didn't
[39:47.800 --> 39:52.080]  come into account in that situation about the car you caught out talking about
[39:52.080 --> 39:56.520]  the car with the three military aged men yes so there was a car that kept
[39:56.520 --> 40:00.800]  following us it would pull up and stop and park as we would stop and talk and
[40:00.800 --> 40:03.800]  stay behind us and as we would walk it would move with us and then eventually
[40:03.800 --> 40:07.680]  drove past and they started screaming get out of here go away then they
[40:07.680 --> 40:11.200]  circled back around and then two more cars came out one of them broke away and
[40:11.200 --> 40:14.280]  went down a side alley where they could watch us as we walk and the other guy
[40:14.280 --> 40:17.880]  followed behind for a while there was three younger men probably ages 20 to
[40:17.880 --> 40:22.360]  25 and they were just staring at us had their cell phones out trying to record
[40:22.360 --> 40:25.680]  what was going on so it was definitely intense so you guys get some footage of
[40:25.680 --> 40:29.400]  this no because we were walking at the time I didn't want to start taking a
[40:29.400 --> 40:32.240]  footage and all of a sudden these guys jump out and start shooting I didn't
[40:32.240 --> 40:37.160]  think it was worth that at the time no I tell you that is very newsworthy that
[40:37.160 --> 40:44.240]  Europeans get run out of a suburb of Brussels Belgium exactly I mean a lot
[40:44.240 --> 40:48.400]  of the last you know multiple terrorist attacks that have happened have been
[40:48.400 --> 40:53.000]  people from Molenby so it's definitely a hot spot for ISIS jihadis it's definitely
[40:53.000 --> 40:56.360]  an area where they are recruiting and training people and doing a lot of
[40:56.360 --> 41:02.000]  planning you know the attacker that was played part in the attack of the
[41:02.000 --> 41:06.680]  Abadaclan theater actually did that and then it came back here and the Belgian
[41:06.680 --> 41:09.800]  police were able to eventually get information and then they got their
[41:09.800 --> 41:13.640]  special forces to come in and conduct a raid and grab that guy there's still a
[41:13.640 --> 41:17.080]  terrorist right now on the loose in Belgium they're currently looking for
[41:17.080 --> 41:23.120]  this person so that is going on right now well Joe you've done a great job I
[41:23.120 --> 41:26.960]  didn't think to tell you guys to take some of the bodycams we have with you
[41:26.960 --> 41:31.720]  so when you get back into Paris or Brussels or wherever go to one of their
[41:31.720 --> 41:36.240]  nicer camera shops and get some bodycams that way you can just activate them
[41:36.240 --> 41:40.360]  whenever you're surrounded by these people and catch it all on tape I
[41:40.360 --> 41:45.360]  imagine that I would have been caught unaware as well whenever this happened
[41:45.360 --> 41:51.320]  but this really shows how loving and sweet these people are I think we should
[41:51.320 --> 41:56.360]  bring a hundred million folks in yeah exactly and that's what people aren't
[41:56.360 --> 41:59.200]  really thinking about they're not looking at it from the common sense side as
[41:59.200 --> 42:02.160]  that you know yeah there are some good people they're trying to come over there
[42:02.160 --> 42:06.120]  they're trying to escape what's going on but in that mix are people hidden and
[42:06.120 --> 42:10.440]  intended intending to do harm on civilians across the country I mean you
[42:10.440 --> 42:15.440]  have ISIS coming out and releasing a video saying that DC is going to be
[42:15.440 --> 42:18.680]  their next target well if you actually go on the map and look at Burke Virginia
[42:18.680 --> 42:24.840]  Burke Virginia is one of the most highly populated areas by Muslims and ISIS
[42:24.840 --> 42:29.840]  also released a kill list naming seven different cities in Texas and one in
[42:29.840 --> 42:33.200]  Virginia and that one being Burke right outside of Washington DC it's about
[42:33.200 --> 42:37.280]  South Southwest a little ways from Washington so it's definitely a lot of
[42:37.280 --> 42:40.840]  stuff heating up right now people need to remain vigilant and we've got to do
[42:40.840 --> 42:45.800]  what we can to expose what's going on so we can show why these open borders are
[42:45.800 --> 42:49.760]  a bad idea why we need to shut it down why we need more people coming out and
[42:49.760 --> 42:52.520]  speaking against it you know we have multiple governors across the country
[42:52.520 --> 42:56.720]  who have said we're not going to take in these Syrian refugees but then you have
[42:56.720 --> 43:00.880]  the State Department today releasing a statement saying hey at the end of the
[43:00.880 --> 43:04.720]  day you might have to do it regardless of the fact of what each state wants to do
[43:04.720 --> 43:11.560]  what the governors intend on doing taking what you learned in Afghanistan and
[43:11.560 --> 43:16.240]  Iraq seeing what you've witnessed unfolding in Syria and other countries
[43:16.240 --> 43:20.040]  with Western governments openly backing these groups to come in and just
[43:20.040 --> 43:25.560]  murder other Muslims murder Christians blow up any religious sites they find
[43:25.560 --> 43:30.120]  we know these are mainly radical Sunnis that are coming into Europe that's why
[43:30.120 --> 43:34.920]  they're recruiting in these neighborhoods what do you think the in-game is of the
[43:34.920 --> 43:38.600]  European leaders pulling something like this and we know it's
[43:38.600 --> 43:42.800]  Balkanization we know they're going to use the threat to take more freedom but
[43:42.800 --> 43:46.640]  how do they think they're going to get away with this long-term suiciding
[43:46.640 --> 43:50.600]  Europe because the death throes of Europe will end up bringing down these
[43:50.600 --> 43:53.440]  globalist traders
[43:54.880 --> 43:58.680]  yeah exactly I mean eventually it's just going to bust into all that war it
[43:58.680 --> 44:02.520]  seems like that kind of is what a lot of the world leaders want to happen is a
[44:02.520 --> 44:05.720]  world war three I mean the military industrial complex is one of the
[44:05.720 --> 44:09.680]  largest ways that these corporations and these banks make money so it makes
[44:09.680 --> 44:12.800]  complete and total sense that they're trying to poke the bear to get something
[44:12.800 --> 44:16.440]  like that to happen I mean you have the French bombing now you have the US
[44:16.440 --> 44:20.240]  Air Force helping out writing messages on their missiles staying from Paris with
[44:20.240 --> 44:23.760]  love no that's what they want they want everyone to live in a state of fear they
[44:23.760 --> 44:28.240]  want to go in take out the Assad regime put in their own Western puppet and take
[44:28.240 --> 44:33.480]  control of that area so eventually they can move over possibly start placing
[44:33.480 --> 44:39.760]  troops in Syria and then eventually go into Iran it really is a purely Machia
[44:39.760 --> 44:43.640]  Valley in worldview where our governments engage the most evil things you can
[44:43.640 --> 44:47.520]  imagine but claim it's for the greater good but then there isn't even a greater
[44:47.520 --> 44:53.200]  good it's just completely cold-blooded to deindustrialize and break up every
[44:53.200 --> 44:58.040]  country on earth including the West and the third world is sold on all this
[44:58.040 --> 45:04.400]  class envy class warfare stuff with carbon taxes and then we actually get
[45:04.400 --> 45:09.400]  the global treaty copy five years ago they're in Copenhagen Denmark when they
[45:09.400 --> 45:14.320]  were having their world summit and it basically doubled the taxes on the third
[45:14.320 --> 45:19.080]  world than what it would do to the first world so it is a ultra massive screw
[45:19.080 --> 45:24.600]  job Joe Biggs you got the floor to give us your views well we were just right
[45:24.600 --> 45:28.320]  before we left Paris we're at the train station and they actually have an iceberg
[45:28.320 --> 45:33.200]  blow-up thing that has police and security guarding it and it is for
[45:33.200 --> 45:36.320]  global warming it's to represent global warming in the conference that's coming
[45:36.320 --> 45:39.400]  up I thought that was extremely interesting that they had that out there
[45:39.400 --> 45:42.080]  and they were kind of pushing that right there at the train station where
[45:42.080 --> 45:48.080]  there's a lot of tourism actually have the pictures up and a link to the site of
[45:48.080 --> 45:51.320]  the train station on my Twitter if you guys want to pull it up you can find it
[45:51.320 --> 45:56.640]  you can see that but they had four or five police vans full of you know
[45:56.640 --> 46:00.400]  policemen soldiers out there walking around security guards guarding this
[46:00.400 --> 46:07.360]  fake iceberg or their global warming thing I want to come back to you in a
[46:07.360 --> 46:10.640]  few minutes but I want to go ahead and switch out with Paul Watson right now
[46:10.640 --> 46:20.000]  okay and get get his his breakdown of this situation it's very very important
[46:20.000 --> 46:25.920]  on top of all the craziness I've got Charlie Sheen right here texting me so
[46:25.920 --> 46:31.120]  I've got to handle that here for a moment well that firestorm going on right now we
[46:31.120 --> 46:37.560]  pray for him obviously but there is just a lot going on here but I want to have
[46:37.560 --> 46:43.720]  Paul Watson come in right now and give us his breakdown on the situation we're
[46:43.720 --> 46:50.640]  witnessing you know for me Paul Watson this is this is so surreal and now
[46:50.640 --> 46:55.040]  we're reconnecting with Paul the Skype cutout this is so surreal for me
[46:55.040 --> 47:06.280]  personally to be sitting here watching Europe suicide itself but watching the
[47:06.280 --> 47:12.440]  globalist suicide the Middle East as well and watching our governments over
[47:12.440 --> 47:16.440]  and over again support the bad guys because they don't want these countries
[47:16.440 --> 47:28.760]  to ever get on their feet I mean Hillary has apologized for supposedly wrecking
[47:28.760 --> 47:32.760]  Libya well why did she get in trouble they did it on purpose they wanted to
[47:32.760 --> 47:39.520]  wreck Libya because it was building up Africa it was creating a African bank
[47:39.520 --> 47:45.960]  system that was actually producing dams and bridges and infrastructure and
[47:45.960 --> 47:52.920]  electrical power and they just blew Libya up I'm gonna skip this network break
[47:52.920 --> 47:58.760]  go all the way to 59 after Paul Watson I'm gonna give you the floor here to
[47:58.760 --> 48:03.280]  really break down your observations first what you saw today I appreciate you
[48:03.280 --> 48:07.600]  and the courage of you and Biggs and Zimmerman and then walk through other
[48:07.600 --> 48:14.040]  things you've witnessed since you were on with us 23 hours ago yesterday
[48:17.160 --> 48:21.640]  well yeah obviously as Biggs said today we visited Mollenbeek which is known as
[48:21.640 --> 48:26.560]  the jihadist capital of Europe it's one of these Muslim no-go ghettos that the
[48:26.560 --> 48:30.800]  left pretends doesn't exist remember Steve Emerson went on Fox News after
[48:30.800 --> 48:35.920]  Charlie Hebdo and blamed some of these radicalized no-go Muslim ghettos for
[48:35.920 --> 48:40.320]  recruiting some of the attackers involved in that incident the left laughed
[48:40.320 --> 48:44.520]  him off the mayor of Paris tried to sue Fox News for those comments and they
[48:44.520 --> 48:48.360]  basically for the next 10 months pretended that these areas don't exist
[48:48.360 --> 48:53.320]  they do exist we've just been in one and again they've earned the reputation for
[48:53.320 --> 48:57.280]  being a no-go zone because as Biggs said we were you know flipped the bird
[48:57.280 --> 49:01.720]  screamed out by these young Muslims in this car they followed us then we went
[49:01.720 --> 49:06.720]  to try and get something in a bar kind of restaurant place and from what I
[49:06.720 --> 49:10.360]  could tell the guy was talking French he was basically saying white people aren't
[49:10.360 --> 49:14.800]  around allowed in restaurants in this area so our white privilege didn't
[49:14.800 --> 49:19.960]  count for much but I'm racist for criticizing the religion of Islam but
[49:19.960 --> 49:25.920]  they've got segregation in these Muslim no-go ghettos so yes they do exist we've
[49:25.920 --> 49:30.880]  been in one and as Biggs said this was where the guy the eighth attacker who is
[49:30.880 --> 49:33.960]  still on the loose in Belgium they haven't caught him he was picked up at
[49:33.960 --> 49:39.200]  around 5 a.m. just a couple of blocks away from the theater siege driven all
[49:39.200 --> 49:44.840]  the way back from Paris to Brussels to this very area where this raid occurred
[49:44.840 --> 49:48.880]  there are no police there whatsoever we didn't see one police officer maybe
[49:48.880 --> 49:52.600]  there was a van driving through once other than that absolutely nothing so
[49:52.600 --> 49:56.320]  they don't want to patrol these areas because they're not welcome and
[49:56.320 --> 50:01.480]  obviously anybody white is not welcome and that was made clear to us so we had
[50:01.480 --> 50:05.840]  to get out of there but that's Mollenbeek that's the the jihadist capital of
[50:05.840 --> 50:14.440]  Europe then of course it's not just the Paris attack in which you know the jihadist
[50:14.440 --> 50:18.640]  came out of that area the ties train attack back in August of course you
[50:18.640 --> 50:23.520]  remember it was derailed by the US military service personnel he came from
[50:23.520 --> 50:29.160]  Mollenbeek Belgium the Jewish Museum bomber here in Brussels last year he
[50:29.160 --> 50:32.240]  opened fire with a Kalashnikov rifle again like the train bomb like the
[50:32.240 --> 50:37.240]  train attacker he lived in Mollenbeek that's why they all come from me of
[50:37.240 --> 50:41.000]  course Belgium has the highest proportion of jihadist being sent to Syria
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.880]  out of the whole of Europe and if you look on Twitter on my Twitter account
[50:45.880 --> 50:50.760]  today I posted the fact that the most number of pro-ISIS tweets expressing
[50:50.760 --> 50:57.120]  sympathy towards ISIS number three on that list is Belgium way above the likes
[50:57.120 --> 51:01.680]  of Turkey way above the likes of Saudi Arabia so there's a huge pro-ISIS
[51:01.680 --> 51:06.680]  sympathy here and it's concentrated in these Muslim no-go-getter areas like
[51:06.680 --> 51:12.400]  Mollenbeek the Madrid train bombings back in 2004 one of the men behind the attack
[51:12.400 --> 51:17.320]  was from Mollenbeek surprise surprise and there are other attacks as well of
[51:17.320 --> 51:21.160]  course the the mastermind behind the Paris attack who is currently based in
[51:21.160 --> 51:27.000]  Syria he came from Mollenbeek as did one of the actual assailants who is still
[51:27.000 --> 51:33.320]  on the loose so this is a an area with 30 40 percent unemployment rate they call
[51:33.320 --> 51:38.480]  it the capital of political Islam in continental Europe that's according to
[51:38.480 --> 51:43.320]  Belgium's interior minister and what's interesting is that even though Belgium is
[51:43.320 --> 51:48.360]  quite a left-wing country obviously quite tolerant of intolerance the
[51:48.360 --> 51:53.320]  Belgian Prime Minister came out yesterday and said almost every time an
[51:53.320 --> 51:58.360]  Islamic terrorist atrocity occurs there is a link with Mollenbeek he went on to
[51:58.360 --> 52:03.400]  say we have tried prevention now we will have to get repressive that was his
[52:03.400 --> 52:08.160]  word repressive it has been a form of laissez-faire and laxity now we are
[52:08.160 --> 52:12.640]  paying the bill of course the eight suspects in the Paris attacks is still
[52:12.640 --> 52:17.640]  on the loose here in Belgium they went and raided his apartment arrested a
[52:17.640 --> 52:21.560]  couple of his brothers I believe it was subsequently released but he's still on
[52:21.560 --> 52:25.600]  the loose and now the Prime Minister of Belgium is saying they need to get
[52:25.600 --> 52:31.800]  repressive in the area of Mollenbeek to clamp down on that jihadist sentiment
[52:31.800 --> 52:45.440]  folks look as the mayor started off expressing our solidarity with the
[52:45.440 --> 52:53.280]  people of France the people of Paris our hearts do go out to them and to
[52:53.280 --> 52:59.440]  Nohimi Gonzalez's family here in Southern California and all those families
[52:59.440 --> 53:09.720]  who lost loved ones this is all done to do one thing terror is designed to
[53:09.720 --> 53:19.120]  inspire terror and we lose they win the moment we give in to that terror the
[53:19.120 --> 53:24.440]  moment we give in and change anything about the openness of our society is the
[53:24.440 --> 53:30.960]  moment they win and we cannot let that happen there will be a tendency both
[53:30.960 --> 53:37.400]  here and in Europe to call for closing borders call for closing down access
[53:37.400 --> 53:43.120]  information etc but that's all this is about that's what they're attempting to
[53:43.120 --> 53:49.720]  do that's the ultimate victory we didn't do it after 9-11 we didn't do it
[53:49.720 --> 53:55.680]  after the Boston Marathon we've never done it every other occasion that's
[53:55.680 --> 54:01.520]  occurred and it is not sustainable and we will succeed and I say to the
[54:01.520 --> 54:06.240]  American people there is no existential threat to the United States in the sense
[54:06.240 --> 54:11.320]  that nothing nothing ISIS can do can threaten to bring down a government can
[54:11.320 --> 54:16.720]  threaten to fundamentally alter the way we live it can be what it is acts of
[54:16.720 --> 54:21.120]  terror to try to get us to do that voluntarily all right let's stop right
[54:21.120 --> 54:24.560]  there because as Paul Watson Skype broke up in Brussels Belgium just an hour
[54:24.560 --> 54:27.600]  and a half from Paris as they're tracking back to the source of the terror
[54:27.600 --> 54:32.200]  what a profound clip in fact you could write a book about that clip we could
[54:32.200 --> 54:39.520]  play that clip 50 times today and not analyze it fully or properly 9-11
[54:39.520 --> 54:42.720]  clearly a stage with Saudi Arabia with criminals in our government that's now
[54:42.720 --> 54:47.040]  come out we've been proven correct to take our liberties launch wars against
[54:47.040 --> 54:53.240]  countries like Iraq that did nothing to us for Saudi Arabia and then on top of
[54:53.240 --> 54:58.080]  this Paul he then gets up and says the terrorists can't fundamentally alter
[54:58.080 --> 55:04.320]  anything in our lives which is true we shouldn't give into terrorists whether
[55:04.320 --> 55:09.360]  they're real or not and basically says giving up our liberty won't protect us
[55:09.360 --> 55:14.880]  but they've already taken so many of our liberties so here is the vice president
[55:14.880 --> 55:19.840]  admitting the terrorists can't defeat us or can't take us down statistically it's
[55:19.840 --> 55:24.160]  very rare to get killed by terrorists but they hype it up both parties have
[55:24.160 --> 55:30.520]  taken our freedoms they're expanding it but he sells freedom as if we keep our
[55:30.520 --> 55:35.880]  borders open that's the one thing see we have no freedom but the freedom to keep
[55:35.880 --> 55:40.040]  our borders open and the freedom to pay for the illegal aliens health care and
[55:40.040 --> 55:44.280]  everything else that's it that's what he's saying so he speaks the language of
[55:44.280 --> 55:49.240]  freedom rhetorically but in reality it's totally empty and they're doing the
[55:49.240 --> 55:53.880]  opposite I mean what an incredible statement could you hear that in Belgium
[55:53.880 --> 55:58.400]  Paul Joseph Watson that Biden clip from this morning where he comes out and
[55:58.400 --> 56:03.040]  says that we've got to stay free we've got to keep our borders open no we're
[56:03.040 --> 56:07.560]  free in the country but we have borders that's what a sovereign country does it's
[56:07.560 --> 56:13.680]  why my body has skin it's why I have a mucous membrane in my mouth I have a
[56:13.680 --> 56:20.960]  border for a reason my cells have a have a barrier plants have a wall not because
[56:20.960 --> 56:26.960]  they're racist but because they die if they didn't Paul Joseph Watson yeah and
[56:26.960 --> 56:30.720]  of course that echoes what salon.com said the other day which I talked about
[56:30.720 --> 56:34.640]  they basically came out with a headline saying the answer to the Paris terror
[56:34.640 --> 56:39.080]  attacks is to invite more Muslim refugees into Paris again absolutely
[56:39.080 --> 56:43.120]  ludicrous makes no sense and today which you probably mentioned as a report out
[56:43.120 --> 56:47.200]  of Baton Rouge that they allowed some of these Syrian refugees into Baton Rouge
[56:47.200 --> 56:51.760]  Louisiana one of them's already escaped missing completely they don't know
[56:51.760 --> 56:58.120]  where he's gone echoing similar or
[56:58.120 --> 57:03.800]  you know Skype is a is a great problem sometimes it works great sometimes it
[57:03.800 --> 57:09.320]  doesn't but it's a great technology and Paul Watson is back finish point yes the
[57:09.320 --> 57:13.280]  same in Germany they're getting to these refugee registration sensors and then
[57:13.280 --> 57:17.640]  just disappearing into the underground so of course ISIS again came out with a
[57:17.640 --> 57:21.880]  promise the other day and said they would infiltrate 4,000 jihadists through
[57:21.880 --> 57:27.240]  this refugee wave and by the way keeping their promises and now they're
[57:27.240 --> 57:32.360]  disappearing from refugee centers inside the United States yeah that's what I was
[57:32.360 --> 57:35.880]  saying Baton Rouge one's gone missing already the first wave that they took
[57:35.880 --> 57:40.680]  in and of course that's only going to happen to a greater extent so the
[57:40.680 --> 57:43.920]  reaction in Paris though seems to be they're not really letting it affect
[57:43.920 --> 57:47.760]  their way of life I mean it was quite deserted on Sunday but it's not like
[57:47.760 --> 57:51.800]  Israel style oppressive security you just walk straight into the train station
[57:51.800 --> 57:55.240]  get on the train there are no checks they were armed police on the train but
[57:55.240 --> 57:59.720]  apart from that it doesn't seem so intense but in Mollenbeek where all these
[57:59.720 --> 58:04.120]  jihadists are from absolutely no police presence whatsoever they're left to
[58:04.120 --> 58:08.120]  their own devices because again we have reports and this is the same in Sweden
[58:08.120 --> 58:12.160]  and other countries that they just pelt rocks at ambulance and firefighters and
[58:12.160 --> 58:16.240]  police whenever they go to the area you know to respond to an incident so it
[58:16.240 --> 58:20.680]  is a no-go area Paul this is sensational and people need to see it I don't want to
[58:20.680 --> 58:25.920]  put you in harm's way it's your decision but rent a car rent a guide do whatever
[58:25.920 --> 58:30.720]  you got to do if it's your choice get in there get footage of these people show
[58:30.720 --> 58:35.280]  them running folks off it's important to show these no-go areas it's important to
[58:35.280 --> 58:39.880]  show ISIS capital inside Europe as mainstream media calls it when we need
[58:39.880 --> 58:43.960]  the footage this is like a vice report or something people need to see this
[58:43.960 --> 58:49.120]  great job having the idea to go there we'll be back Paul stay there most of

[59:55.720 --> 01:00:11.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:18.720]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:34.040]  Texas Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen you cannot make this up headlines on
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:39.120]  info wars.com with multiple links to all of it get Daniel's article leftist
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:45.040]  media your racist give you support Paris victims and see folks couldn't come out
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:48.960]  and say black lives matters was wrong to basically say hey these are white
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:55.440]  people these are bad people you know don't don't don't cry for them and the
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:58.880]  left couldn't say that black lives matter was wrong so they've now come out
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:07.360]  and doubled down the independence and others have come out and said that you
[01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:12.720]  are racist so see there's an extremism in these people where they've always got
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:19.960]  to go further than the next and that's what makes them so bizarre looking and
[01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:24.800]  behaving to anyone who's not a psychotic but I tell you Paul Watson is
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:31.800]  leftist hysteria peaking or are we only seeing a new height in their bizarre
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:37.880]  behaviors I think there's such a massive backlash against it that it is
[01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.760]  starting to peak now and we're gonna see it collapse I mean the death of
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.360]  political correctness has been heralded by many pundits who have been covering
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.240]  this for years but as you just mentioned the independent came out with an
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.120]  article and basically said if you change your Facebook profile picture or your
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.240]  Twitter profile picture to an image of the French flag in solidarity with the
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:59.680]  victims as you know millions and millions of people are done you know
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.360]  that could be taken as kind of lazy virtue signaling but if you're just
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:06.120]  doing it to express sympathy with the victims what's the big deal the
[01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:09.720]  independent came out and said if you do that then you're exercising white to
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:15.960]  supremacy we're talking about this article what is wrong with these
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:20.760]  people why do they hate because I don't like white supremacist groups I find
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:23.760]  them as you know upsetting and stupid as the black supremacist groups or
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:28.720]  whatever but at the same time they don't get endorsement by CNN MSNBC and the
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:33.280]  White House I mean this this anti-white movement is real it's global and it's
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.160]  insane don't all these minorities that have come to Europe understand that if
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:43.000]  the radical jihadis get in they're gonna murder them well yeah of course the
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.160]  vast majority of victims of Islamic terror are other Muslims but that's the
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:51.160]  point I am her see Ali and a lot of these other commentators have made this
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:55.720]  there's no strong voice within moderate Islam to condemn radical Islam and then
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:59.720]  if you go drill down into the tenets of Islam itself you know it's not being
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:02.880]  misinterpreted if you take it literally then it's being directly
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.280]  interpreted from the Quran so there aren't enough moderate voices within
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:10.000]  Islam to speak out against that then you get people like the grand mufti in
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  Australia who came out and said basically terrorism is caused by racism and
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.160]  Islamophobia so again it's Islamophobic to draw attention to the fact that
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:25.200]  there are problems within the religion of Islam and the Quran that's racist even
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:30.080]  though Islam is not a race but you can go into an area like Molenby get refused
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:34.960]  service in a restaurant segregation and you're still the racist you're still the
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:38.440]  white supremacist you know I've got an idea out there and harass how about you
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:42.920]  go to the local police station and file a discrimination claim against that
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.200]  business I'm serious I want to go get video the front of it then get out of
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:49.720]  there and then I you know tomorrow whenever and then I want to go to the
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.680]  police department I want to file a report I'm serious this is news and I
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:58.600]  bet you can go to other places you're not gonna get service yeah because it's
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:02.400]  it's a no-go area there is no there's no tolerance there that's what the left
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:05.560]  always preaches and yet there's no tolerance of any outsiders and it's
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.920]  funny because I read articles today from other journalists who were there when
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.640]  the police were there just after the raid was going on when there were more
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:15.720]  journalists there and they were saying oh these people are really friendly they've
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:20.640]  kind of got a bit of a bad rep now now there are no police there it's gone back
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:25.200]  to normal straight back to normal so yeah I want to keep my head attached to my
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:35.240]  body that's why I don't want to go back there are you going back Paul no we've
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:38.920]  got some good video out there though well listen what I'm saying is and we'll
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:42.840]  we'll plan it later obviously but you need to get a guide get a car I want
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.440]  shots cinematic shots up and down the street show it don't go to that exact
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:53.200]  location but others because this is big this needs to be shown Watson Watson I'm
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:59.800]  sending you back oh we got a bunch of guests coming up a man has filed a
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.640]  lawsuit against his landlord over the right to have a firearm in his
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:09.120]  apartment reports guns.com Harvey Limbo's apartment was targeted a total of five
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:13.960]  times before he purchased a handgun Limbo who suffers from diabetes the
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:18.000]  generative heart disease and chronic pain Belize burglars targeted his home
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.160]  searching for prescription pills and less than 12 hours after he purchased his
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:26.920]  gun he was met face-to-face with one of those burglars Limbo was sleeping with
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:31.320]  his newly purchased gun under his pillow and was awakened around midnight and saw
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.200]  a shadowy figure pass from the kitchen into the living room the thief was
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:38.800]  found sifting through prescription pills so Limbo trained his gun on the
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.880]  intruder and warned him not to move as he called 9-1-1 the thief did move
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:47.040]  however and was shot in the shoulder days later Limbo was contacted by
[01:05:47.040 --> 01:05:50.520]  Stanford management company with a reminder that he agreed not to have a

[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:51.120]  Republican candidate Carson's background and dig through all of it but the
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:56.920]  media won't dig through Obama's background that is as phony as a suitcase

[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:38.760]  be documenting the jihad slums outside Paris but also in Brussels Belgium
[01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:43.520]  they're going to be detailing the troops on the streets inside Paris and more
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:48.680]  and also getting footage to come back here and make a documentary basically
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.960]  detailing exactly what it was like they're also going to be talking to
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:58.800]  folks on the street and what they think about people like Le Pen who is a
[01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:02.600]  front-runner in many polls for president right now being arrested and
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:07.640]  indicted and facing multiple years in prison for a month ago saying there's
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:13.800]  an Islamic invasion of France you I mean I thought Europe was free and you had
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:18.040]  free speech I mean that's why we're there it's not just about the 130 something
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:22.000]  dead last week and the seven attacks there's also the refugee centers being
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.640]  burned there are some real refugees we really feel sorry for them but the
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:32.240]  numbers are out in the US 2,000 plus Muslim refugees so far less than 20
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:39.760]  something like the numbers are up on drugsreport.com are actually even from
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:45.680]  areas that are Christian so you have a fraction of these people that are
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:55.440]  Christian it is completely and totally outrageous that this is happening but we
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.920]  have the video Paul today before they went in info or set to go into the
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.040]  Islamist's hotbed they need to get that report filed tonight with their footage
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:11.720]  it is incredible I'm told to sit here and to witness the fact that it's true
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:19.040]  Brussels Belgium is basically an ISIS command base Brussels Belgium is
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:24.080]  basically the capital of Jihad terror and is now its own state I mean I think
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:28.760]  that's really the takeaway here here's the number resettlement map in the USA
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:34.280]  we got a document cam on this for TV viewers you can see the map of where
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:38.360]  this is happening inside the United States they plan to send a bunch to Texas
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:45.200]  Florida New York I mean you name it Idaho I mean basically the whole country if
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.120]  I think every state's getting them but put North and South Dakota but then you
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:56.280]  look at the numbers of what's here already 2098 Muslims 53 are Christians
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:12:01.040]  I don't know why I said 20 my brain messed that up so 2098 Muslims 53 are
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.640]  Christians this is what we're talking about and I agree with Glenn Beck you
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.800]  know bring in women and children bring in Christians you can even bring in
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:13.520]  Shiites from places like Syria they don't have a history of attacking the
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:17.880]  country that is Syrian Shiites but you don't bring in Wahhabi is with fake
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:23.840]  passports I mean this is a Saudi Arabian basically invasion of the world with
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:27.520]  sleeper cells and I'm now sure of it we're going to Joel Gilbert here in a
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:31.800]  few minutes but Paul Joseph Watson closing comments on what you witness so
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:36.320]  far other points that need to be covered I don't think we can stress how
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:43.440]  outrageous this is yeah I mean I'm sick to the back teeth of liberals and
[01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:46.920]  progressives pretending that these no-go areas don't exist we had it in
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.720]  London we've got sharia no zone no-go zones in London where they've got signs
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:55.600]  up saying no alcohol allowed they harass people on the street and it's
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:59.880]  interesting you know because the left is always up in arms about homophobia
[01:12:59.880 --> 01:13:04.240]  meanwhile we've got these ISIS jihadists literally throwing gays off
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:08.160]  buildings I mean God forbid if you were a gay person in that area they would
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:11.960]  probably string you up I also wanted to draw attention to a tweet which I sent
[01:13:11.960 --> 01:13:16.120]  you last night I made this tweet on September 9th and you know not bragging
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:21.120]  because it was entirely predictable so on September 9th I tweeted I give it two
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:26.360]  months until one of these refugees in inverted commas goes jihadists and kills
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:31.040]  someone the left will call anyone who draws this parallel a racist I said that
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:36.040]  on September 9th it was four months four days after that two month window so I
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:40.160]  was only four days out that Paris happened of course one of the suspects if
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:44.880]  not more was got into the country got into Europe on a Syrian passport doesn't
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:49.580]  matter if that passport was forged they took his fingerprints at the scene of the
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.640]  Paris attacks matched them with him coming into Greece so he abused this
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:58.520]  migrant red carpet and it led to the massacre the massacre that we saw in
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:02.760]  Paris and it was painfully predictable and I predicted it two months before I
[01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.880]  said this is gonna happen in two months lo and behold two months and four days
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.280]  later it happens and you know dozens and dozens of people dead hundreds injured
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.480]  we have the massacre in Paris that's right in fact you retweeted that last
[01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:19.680]  night you sent me the tweet where you had said that months ago and it happened
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:24.200]  right on time and I'll predict Paul as we predicted as well there'll be more of
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:30.960]  these attacks how many times since the invasion of Syria Paul have I said or you
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:35.440]  said or our reporters said that we're gonna see jihad attacks all across
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:40.440]  Europe the UK and the United States and now it's happening but when you expand
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:46.440]  on all of this Paul most of the attacks on Army Navy were Marine Corps centers
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:51.200]  military bases Fort Hood they don't even call them jihad attacks when they
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:57.000]  happen no they've been attacks I think there was one in Belgium there was one
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.600]  in France as well where you know that jihadists is shouting alarack bar as
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.440]  he plows his vehicle into police officers there was one in Canada as well
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.400]  and there's just gloss over it and it's disappeared from the media a day later
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:14.040]  but you know it goes to the fact that these people would complete cowards
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:19.120]  they are complete cowards Paul skype again breaking up joining us from Brussels
[01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:27.800]  Belgium an hour and a half away from Paris Paul in closing what are you
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:31.000]  planning next before you go back to the UK I'm not only give away all of our
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.760]  plans but are you gonna go back into Paris and I guess the guys will go back
[01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:39.760]  into Belgium later obviously we need to document the 5,000 trips on the streets
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:45.400]  of Paris can't arm the citizens but put 5,000 trips on the streets yeah those
[01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:48.240]  troops aren't very visible now though I think they were more visible on the
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.880]  first day there were some police outside the train station as big said
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:56.400]  guarding the global warming inflatable like that was important but it's not
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:01.400]  that repressive on the streets of Paris from what we've seen so far so it looks
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:05.400]  like they haven't completely overreacted again in complete difference to what we
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.240]  experienced in London after 7 7 where basically everything we filmed we were
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.800]  getting harassed by police walking up to us here where you haven't been harassed
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:18.160]  ones for filming or anything like that so in terms of free expression and the
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:23.080]  media the state of free speech in Europe still you know hangs on until
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:26.600]  these jihadists have their own way and you know all criticism of them is
[01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:30.360]  outlawed I guess well not in Germany though they've tried to outlaw
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:33.520]  demonstrations that doesn't seem to be working and that's the answer to this
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:38.640]  ban on free speech is just exercise it regardless exactly and of course you've
[01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:43.480]  got the Facebook situation with Merkel going after hate speech if you actually
[01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:46.920]  drill down into some of those comments they weren't violent at all now you've
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:50.680]  got ex-Starsie officials in Germany cracking down on that which is only
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:55.760]  going to make the whole Pagida movement and the backlash bigger so you know more
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.800]  power to them if they want to do that it's only going to blow back in their
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:03.160]  faces because you know free speech is a more powerful ideology than anything that
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:06.880]  these cowardly jihadists with their crappy little suicide bombs in which they
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:11.400]  can only blow up themselves targeting innocent people it's bigger stronger
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:15.400]  principle than anything they can ever achieve that's right and we're going to
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:18.440]  work to make sure our corrupt Western governments don't use these attacks to
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:22.200]  be misdirected against innocent Muslim nations that have been the same victims
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:27.600]  of this filth our filthy governments turn these very dogs these very pigs these
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:33.800]  very rats loose on the people of Egypt Libya Syria and Iraq and we are kicking
[01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:37.520]  their butts worldwide we're exposing it in our own governments have now been
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.960]  forced to go after ISIS because we've exposed them there goes Paul Watson from

[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.280]  heart attack late last year just this past August was when we spread his ashes
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.200]  on the St. Croix River. I loved my dad but boy was he stubborn. He hadn't been to
[01:23:36.200 --> 01:23:41.200]  the doctor in over 25 years. His excuse? He simply couldn't afford it. He wasn't a
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:45.880]  rich man by any means. At less than $107 per month Libertyoncall.org would

[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:31.440]  Joe Gilbert, documentary filmmaker is our guest. He made of course the hit film
[01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:40.160]  Dreams of My Real Father. He also has produced the films Atomic Jihad, Farewell
[01:24:40.160 --> 01:24:45.440]  Israel Bush, Iran, The Revolt of Islam and you know I tell you I wanted to get
[01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:49.240]  him on to parallel the situation with Ben Carson how they're digging through
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:53.760]  his whole background and finding small anomalies and demonizing him but what
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:57.800]  about Obama's background? Different names, different birth certificates. I mean
[01:24:57.800 --> 01:25:01.760]  you know the Harvard Law Review that he edited says he was born in Kidnea. His
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:05.320]  wife says he's born in Kenya. Then he says he never said that. Well it's all
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:09.440]  cover. He was born in Hawaii to Frank Marshall Davis. It's all hiding in
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:13.560]  plain view. He admits he stayed summers with him. The same photos. I mean it's
[01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:18.120]  incredible but I got to be honest. Joel Gilbert's an expert on radical Islam
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:22.760]  and has been involved exposing that. And I used to see Gilbert's work in 2008,
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:29.080]  2010. Never had him on about Islam because it sounded crazy to me that they'd
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:32.760]  open Europe in America and bring in jihadis and there was a plan for a
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:36.960]  caliphate with Obama and he's the guy that kind of woke up Glenn Beck and
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:41.800]  people. And I've got to now say I was wrong. I mean I don't know they're gonna
[01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:45.080]  actually set it up but they're sure letting them try. They sure overthrew
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:49.320]  all these allies and put these people in charge. So Joel in this short segment
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:52.320]  and the next few segments will give you the floor to get into the parallels and
[01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:57.360]  talk about your films that we sell them for store.com I should add. But on the
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:02.720]  jihad I mean how did you see this coming in 2008? Because I mean I respected you
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:06.160]  when you did films that were putting millions of mailboxes and all that stuff
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:10.600]  you did. But I just still thought it was kind of whacked out. What crystal ball
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:15.920]  were you looking into buddy? Well if you understand the goals and value of
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:20.920]  Islamists of the Islamist agenda everything is pretty easy to understand
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:26.320]  and it's always a disappointment for me that our policymakers don't consult
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:31.640]  experts in the area and they simply react to whatever is happening that week. In
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:37.720]  my film farewell Israel I documented how 9-11 was successful from the point of
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:43.080]  view of of bin Laden and the Islamists not because they killed people in New
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:47.960]  York but because they drew America into the Middle East and they caused a change
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:55.080]  in American policy. The goal of 9-11 was to bring America in and enlist America
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:58.880]  in the Islamist cause. Don't forget the Islamists in Al Qaeda were fighting
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.960]  Saddam Hussein, they were fighting Qaddafi, they were fighting Assad, they were
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:06.440]  trying to get rid of the king of Saudi Arabia, they were trying to get rid of
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:10.760]  Mubarak. After 9-11 George Bush implemented what he called a freedom
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:16.680]  agenda to help in his mind bring freedom to the Muslims of the Middle East and
[01:27:16.680 --> 01:27:20.960]  if we would just have a democratic election then liberal democracy would
[01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:24.640]  break out all over the place. The Islamists knew that if there were free
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:28.760]  elections and they got rid of these autocrats they would replace them with
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:32.640]  an Islamist government and that's what's happened everywhere there's been free
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:36.480]  elections. It started with the Bush administration's freedom agenda and
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:41.160]  Obama has continued it. Unfortunately again there's a big lack of
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:47.800]  understanding of ISIS. ISIS today acts as a counterbalance to the influence of
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:53.840]  Iran and Hezbollah in the region. If America and the West eliminate ISIS and
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:59.040]  attack ISIS, number one it gives them an excuse to attack us. Number two if we do
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:04.280]  defeat ISIS, Iran and Hezbollah will simply take over those areas and start
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:09.880]  slaughtering all the Sunni Muslims just as the ISIS was doing to the Shia and
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:14.760]  what are we going to do then? Go back in and now defeat the Iranians and then
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:18.160]  pull back out and then ISIS comes back in. So there's a fundamental
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:22.720]  misunderstanding of the force of Islamism and what it represents and what
[01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:28.600]  its goals are and that's what I've been trying to educate through my films. And
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:32.960]  it really does show the original Machiavellian idea doesn't come from
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:37.520]  Italy, it comes from the Middle East. If you go back to even pre-Muhammad, the
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:43.240]  constant stabbing in the back, joining other sides, different combinations,
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:49.040]  different alliances just creates total instability and it's very very sad to
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:53.480]  see us sucked into this craziness. Exactly what we don't understand in the
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:59.720]  West is that nation-states do not exist in the Middle East. The nation-state of
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:05.480]  you're an Italian, you're a Frenchman, you're German. The nation-state is a
[01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:10.120]  Western invention that was meant as a Christian solution for Christian
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:14.400]  problems. During the Middle Ages the Protestant Reformation came about
[01:29:14.400 --> 01:29:20.200]  because of opposition to the control by the Catholic Church. So the Protestants
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:24.560]  and the secularists took a hundred years to get rid of the church as the
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:31.200]  political power and nationalism, nation-states, secular nation-states were
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:35.080]  the solution to create a new political order. Stay there, continue breaking this
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:38.680]  down to understand the class of civilizations. We came out of the
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:43.200]  Dark Ages, the Middle East never did as what Joel Gilbert sang and now the
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:48.360]  Socialists are trying to integrate stone-aged societies with us. We're on
[01:29:48.360 --> 01:29:56.440]  the march, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:03.200]  CIA boss John Brennan said Monday violating the Fourth Amendment and
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:07.600]  eliminating the privacy of virtually every American will be required if the
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:12.040]  United States hopes to stop the attacks by the Islamic State. He said recent
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:16.120]  proposed NSA reforms and a return to the principles enshrined in the
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:20.360]  Constitution will make our ability collectively, internationally to find
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:24.640]  these terrorists much more challenging. I would anticipate this is not the only
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:29.520]  operation ISIL has in the pipeline. Brennan said in remarks delivered at the
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:33.920]  Center for Strategic and International Studies. During the Intelligence and
[01:30:33.920 --> 01:30:40.400]  National Security Summit in September, officials from the FBI, CIA, NSA, NGO,
[01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:46.320]  DIA and NRO decried the deep cynicism of American people over surveillance.
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:50.240]  Brennan attributed this to a misunderstanding between the American
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:31:00.040]  people and the American government. You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[01:32:59.360 --> 01:33:29.200]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:38.280]  I am your host, Alex Jones. Joe Gilbert is our guest. If you haven't seen his
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:43.360]  documentary, Dreams from My Real Father, it's available at infowarsstore.com or
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:49.520]  at JoeGilbert.net. It's incredibly conclusive on who Obama's real
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:55.840]  father is and that the whole Kenya birth certificate situation was a
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:00.040]  distraction from the fact that his father was Frank Marshall Davis. Photos of
[01:34:00.040 --> 01:34:03.680]  him in the house, Obama admitting he was raised in the house, that his
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:07.760]  grandfather was best friends with him, his mother, you know, photographed
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:13.320]  shooting the porn with Frank Marshall Davis on the same couch, in the same
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:17.920]  living room, that Obama has released photos of himself on. I mean it is open
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:23.400]  and shut and they set us up, didn't they, with those fake birth certificates and
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:28.840]  Obama saying he was born in Kenya and then saying he never said that, all meant
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:35.760]  to bait us in. And Joe Gilbert blew it wide open. It's incredible. Going back to
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:43.240]  Joe Gilbert. Joe, so we have this dark age system and you have some, you know,
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.720]  Muslims that want to live in peace and want to be left alone, but they're the
[01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:49.440]  ones always being murdered and slaughtered and taken over by the radicals in
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:55.160]  Islam. I mean it's clear. Why then would the West fund them to go after Assad and
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:00.400]  then bring so many of them in? Don't the leftist, doesn't Haland and Merkel and
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:05.880]  Obama know that they're going to attack and have been attacking? I mean we saw
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:09.080]  these Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Recruiting Center attacks. We saw the
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.160]  Fort Hood attack. We saw the Garland attack. They kept saying not there, not
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:18.240]  there, not there. And then now they can't spend this. What are they thinking when
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:22.200]  they bring these refugees in by the millions? What is the in-game point of
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:26.760]  the politicians and where do you see this going? Well you have to know that
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:34.200]  Barack Obama is a revolutionary Marxist. His goal is to disrupt and destroy the
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:39.280]  free market system and the free speech system that we have in America. Marxists
[01:35:39.280 --> 01:35:43.920]  and Islamists have always had the same goal in common and that is to destroy
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:50.160]  the Western society and the Western capitalist system. They see this as the
[01:35:50.160 --> 01:35:54.720]  number one obstacle to taking power and therefore their common enemy. That's why
[01:35:54.720 --> 01:35:59.360]  the Soviet Union works so closely with building up Islamist groups in the heyday
[01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:05.760]  of the Soviet Empire. Obama is simply continuing that. He identifies with the
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:11.280]  Islamist struggle and cause against the evil Western powers. It's Obama's natural
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:17.520]  inclination to partner with Islamist groups. He has a great deal of sympathy
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.800]  for them. And when we go back to talking about Obama's biography in Dreams for My
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:27.520]  Father, he wrote for example about his childhood in Indonesia, Muslim country,
[01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:31.840]  what he tried to hide, which I have through my latest research I think
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:36.280]  uncovered. He claimed that he went from Occidental College after two years to
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:40.260]  Columbia for two more years. I think it's very clear and I have a lot of
[01:36:40.260 --> 01:36:45.320]  evidence to support it that Obama spent his junior year abroad in Pakistan
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:50.080]  living as an adult in a Muslim country. And that's where he gained his affinity
[01:36:50.080 --> 01:36:53.320]  for the Islamic culture and Islamic religion and his sympathy for
[01:36:53.320 --> 01:36:57.000]  everything Islam. And I think you can see that in his policies toward the
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:02.720]  Middle East. I've also chronicled that his education was paid for by the Saudis
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:07.240]  who supported a fund for radical black students in the 80s and that's how he
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:12.040]  got into Harvard. Once the Saudis finished with him academically, they
[01:37:12.040 --> 01:37:16.960]  handed him over to the Arab-funded political network with Tony Rezko. So
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:20.840]  Obama's entire academic and political career were funded by Middle Eastern
[01:37:20.840 --> 01:37:26.000]  interests because he identified with the Islamist goals. Now we know his
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.320]  grandfather was CIA and we know he's tied into that. I always thought he was a
[01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:38.120]  deep cover infiltrator into the deep cover sleeper Islam political cells but
[01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:44.320]  are you saying this may be a triple cross? Look, Obama was raised and radicalized
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:49.320]  by his real biological father Frank Marshall Davis. He admits to being raised
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:53.920]  by him and he's done a great deal to try to distance himself from the connection
[01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:57.720]  to Davis including a nose job which is chronicled on my website
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:02.840]  ObamasRealFather.com. He scrubbed Frank Marshall Davis from the audio book of
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:06.880]  Dreams for My Father but the political ideology shows that he was radicalized
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:12.280]  by Davis who was a Soviet agent, a pro-Russian sympathizer, anti-American,
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:15.960]  anti-white. And by the way, all that is admitted Frank Marshall Davis was one of
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:20.720]  the highest level communists in the US. Correct. He was on security index A. That
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:24.360]  meant if there was a conflict between Russia and the Soviet Union, Davis would
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:29.440]  be immediately arrested. When Frank Marshall Davis dies in 1987, I'm sorry,
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:35.160]  1985, Obama shows up at Reverend Wright's church and that becomes his
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:39.600]  substitute father figure. It's literally the same guy. Obama is very comfortable
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:43.680]  with anti-American extremists and they're comfortable with him because he has a
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:49.520]  shared ideology and the ideology of Islam which is anti-western, anti-Israel,
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:55.760]  anti-capitalist is a, these are brothers in arms and that's why and that's how
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:59.680]  you can understand Obama's Middle East policy and why he wants to bring in
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:06.480]  Muslim refugees even though there's a high likelihood of terrorist attacks in
[01:39:06.480 --> 01:39:09.520]  the United States. And then Merkel's parents were admittedly in the East
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:15.800]  German communist government and then we looked at the socialist French
[01:39:15.800 --> 01:39:20.600]  president. I mean these people really are just haters of their, of their
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:26.000]  countries. They're self-haters. They're people that believe in an
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:31.840]  international revolutionary movement. The nationalist movement which brought the
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:36.040]  West to success. It made America great. It created all these, all this wealth and
[01:39:36.040 --> 01:39:40.360]  we spread it out all over the world. Western civilization is what brought
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:45.120]  America into the world of modernity and created so much prosperity. They are
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:50.120]  against all of this. Unfortunately they have profound misunderstandings and
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:54.360]  Obama was indoctrinated and raised his entire life in this little known world
[01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:58.160]  of American Marxism and he committed the biggest fraud in the history of the
[01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:02.480]  United States. He claimed to be a centrist running for office. He said I'm
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:05.960]  gonna cut the deficit in half. I'll support Israel. Obamacare is not a tax.
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:10.240]  Everything he said was an intentional lie and I even showed that in my movie
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:14.400]  There's No Place Like Utopia that it's almost like the Wizard of Oz where
[01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:18.880]  Obama made all these phony promises and people just thought I'll just go down
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:23.560]  the yellow brick road but just like Dorothy got to the Emerald City and the
[01:40:23.560 --> 01:40:28.080]  Wizard sent her to the Witch's Castle where she was taken prisoner in a
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:34.120]  dungeon in the Gulag. So the road to the path of socialism, Marxism, all this
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:38.240]  nonsense always leads to the Gulag. Doesn't lead to prosperity. Well let's expand on that.
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:44.080]  Israel is a diverse country. It has six, seven big parties. You've got socialists.
[01:40:44.080 --> 01:40:48.320]  You've got right-wingers. You've got three, four different types of Zionists. But I
[01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:54.360]  personally have experienced, Joel, the mental illness of the anti-Israelers.
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:58.720]  Some of the Arabs, some of the white supremacist groups, some of the
[01:40:58.720 --> 01:41:03.760]  liberal groups. I was never even what you'd call a supporter of Israel. I just
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:08.400]  knew that it was a football issue used back and forth so I didn't get into it.
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:12.600]  But to experience how they've even gotten a lot of libertarians and
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:19.600]  conservatives to support leftist UN propaganda by demonizing Israel until
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:24.400]  hating Israel has become like a sickening religion and then I've been so
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:29.160]  demonized by the groups that attack Israel and so lied about it pushes me
[01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:33.360]  towards Israel even though I stayed out of it because the people attacking
[01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:38.200]  Israel are such incredible liars and exaggerators and just make stuff up
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:41.920]  constantly. I mean they're just incredible and then I track it back to
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:47.200]  again Saudi Arabian funding over and over again basically financing these
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:51.320]  groups and flying these right-wingers over there and all the rest of it. I
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:56.480]  mean it's really sick. Well people don't understand that Israel is the number
[01:41:56.480 --> 01:42:01.160]  one US ally in the world, let alone the Middle East. It's only because of Israel
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:05.320]  in this in the era of Soviet Union during the Cold War Israel held back all
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:09.160]  those Soviet backstays that were trying to dominate the region, dominate the
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:15.360]  Gulf, and dominate oil. Today Israel is the bulwark of US, Western, and European
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:20.200]  defense against Iranian expansion, Islamist expansion. If Israel wasn't
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:26.160]  there, ISIS would be in Jordan. ISIS would be in Saudi Arabia. So Israel
[01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:31.760]  really is the defender at this point of Western civilization against the
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:35.440]  Iranian and Islamist invasion and without Israel the United States would be
[01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:40.840]  less secure. What do you say about Jews like George Soros who admits he's
[01:42:40.840 --> 01:42:45.280]  behind the refugee crisis? Well don't forget George Soros was a Nazi
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:49.240]  collaborator, something he never apologized for, and lo and behold he
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:56.360]  showed up in London in his early career selling paintings, valuable artworks
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:43:02.720]  that were confiscated by the Nazis. So his early role whether he was
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:07.640]  a so he was originally a Nazis agent, whether he became a Soviet agent after
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:13.360]  that. All of this is something that hasn't rightfully been exposed properly
[01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:17.120]  about what his real roots are. We know he was a Nazi collaborator. We know he
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:22.880]  worked with the Soviet Union on some level. George Soros is a Marxist and
[01:43:22.880 --> 01:43:28.200]  supports and pays for all the radical anti-American groups. He's probably one
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.920]  of the most. All of his funding at least 10 groups that are after me constantly
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:34.680]  with dirty tricks you can't even imagine. Well I encourage you to look at his
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:41.040]  early history and his history as a Nazi collaborator and why hasn't Israel
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:45.960]  gone after him as they go after other old Nazis. Soros went on what 60 minutes
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:50.480]  like 15 years ago the clips online but they always expungent and said I don't
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:55.480]  apologize I did what I had to do. He actually goes rounding up Jews helping
[01:43:55.480 --> 01:44:02.680]  fine Jews helping steal their money and then he's running around free. I think
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:07.400]  he should be investigated not only for his connection to the Nazis but to the
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:11.320]  Soviet Union after the war and I don't know why they don't go after him but
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:15.560]  he's so well embedded in American politics. He's probably the one of the
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:20.200]  most dangerous people because he's had so much wealth and he provides it to the
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:24.480]  radical anti-American groups and he's an ally of Barack Obama and Hillary
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:27.280]  Clinton by the way. Oh sure he's the guy behind him and I just want to say this
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:30.960]  right now to listeners. I'm not putting on a show I'm not saying hey I'm a big
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:36.840]  man. Joel Gilbert, World Net Daily, Matt Drudge myself, people like us. We are in
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:41.400]  the crosshairs of these folks okay. This isn't a game we need your prayers we
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:44.560]  need you to buy our products we need you to support us we need you to spread the
[01:44:44.560 --> 01:44:49.120]  word about the show because we're not up here saying and doing all this for fun.
[01:44:49.120 --> 01:44:54.320]  We're in a fight and I want people to really really sit back and realize you
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:58.480]  ask folks to take on tyranny you ask people to stand up against evil we're
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:04.840]  doing it okay we're doing it and you need to buy Joel Gilbert's films you need
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:09.040]  to buy his books need to buy my books my films my materials so we can fund this
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:12.680]  operation so we can do more we spend most our time just trying to fund our
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:16.760]  operations instead of fighting the globalist we need your support we need
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:19.640]  your prayers this is not a game I've never asked Joel what he's been through
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:24.560]  but Project Veritas has been arrested threatened attacked we've been attacked
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:31.440]  demonized just just viciously and it's only intensifying and it's creepy when
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:37.720]  White House run organizations like MSNBC media matters you name it get up on
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:43.800]  TV if they had Bill Maher two weeks ago put up on screen info wars.com and a
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:48.600]  fake headline saying cancer is not bad for you that's the kind of stuff they
[01:45:48.600 --> 01:45:53.160]  do that they get up on MSNBC and say Alex Jones doesn't like black people and
[01:45:53.160 --> 01:45:58.760]  is deeply racist with no proof now that's dangerous folks and they wouldn't
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:03.160]  be doing things like that if they weren't desperate because just a few years
[01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:07.040]  ago they wouldn't lie like that because they could lose lawsuits now they don't
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:10.680]  even care if they get sued that shows they've entered a new phase Joel Gilbert
[01:46:10.680 --> 01:46:15.040]  what do you say to that I'm gonna I'm gonna have to agree with you because the
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:18.800]  don't forget the Black Lives Matter movement meets in the White House with
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:24.600]  Barack Obama his operatives helped start and fund the organization Black Lives
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:29.600]  Matter is is a movement not dissimilar to you know the the weather
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:34.160]  underground the SDS were anti-police they said let's murder the police let's
[01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:40.800]  kill the policemen kill your parents this was a movement to destroy legal law
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:45.280]  and order in the United States to allow for this communist revolution that Obama's
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:51.600]  mentor Bill Ayers and his terrorist gang wanted to carry carry through so we
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:57.360]  see a resurrection of that anti-cop 60s movement through Barack Obama whose
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:47:03.120]  father was was part of that and whose mentors an entire life was involved with
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.680]  these radical groups out of Chicago like Acorn and the Alinsky gang it's
[01:47:07.680 --> 01:47:11.160]  definitely a new phase where they just don't you're right they don't mind lying
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:15.880]  they walk radical Islamist Muslim Brotherhood Black Lives Matter they're
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:19.000]  all meeting in the White House today that would not have been possible five
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:23.120]  six years ago does that mean they think they're stronger or they're making their
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:30.520]  move I think both they don't forget the Obama White House and Department of
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:38.080]  Justice persecuted through the IRS conservative political groups they violated
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:41.320]  the first amendment by trying to take down their opposition they even had a
[01:47:41.320 --> 01:47:47.600]  plan to arrest opposition to their agenda all of this was simply swept under
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:54.800]  the rug so the agenda was take power use people to take power use poor people to
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:59.440]  take power that is classical totalitarianism to persecute tens of
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:03.880]  thousands of Christian veterans and Second Amendment groups that's right out
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:09.840]  of a totalitarian dictatorship it's right out of the Maoist Leninist playbook
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:13.360]  is lie to people don't tell them your true agenda tell them you want to help
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:17.200]  them tell them you want to give them free things use them to take power and
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:22.440]  once you take power use the tools of state like the IRS the press to keep a
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:27.160]  permanent hold on power and that's been the game plan all along it's a soft
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:33.440]  Marxist revolution that's been taking place right under our eyes it's so
[01:48:33.440 --> 01:48:38.280]  crazy to see black unemployment double by design under Obama so they can have
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:41.840]  even more control over these folks and then to have some of the black people
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:46.480]  not know they're being targeted yeah everything that's wrong with public
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:51.080]  policy in America urban America 50% unemployment black youth drug culture
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:56.080]  crime single motherhood everything that can be affected by public policy
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:59.920]  Democrats are responsible for Democrats controlled all these cities and
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:05.800]  destroyed them with these socialist ideas and dependency societies that
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:11.360]  ruined black America they simply are using them because the game plan of the
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:15.080]  Marxist is to use different groups hit them against each other to seize power
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:19.720]  and unfortunately I don't know that black America even realizes how they've
[01:49:19.720 --> 01:49:26.040]  been used and played by Obama who is at the core he's not black he's red he's
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:32.520]  from the red Marxist groups and he's not one of them based on not doing anything
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:36.640]  for the black community and simply using them to keep power well it's ridiculous
[01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:39.560]  and you'll see him out there trying to act like you know he's just one of the
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:44.040]  American people it's clear he is a true villain we're going to break but I want
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:48.800]  to start now the parallels the hypocrisy where they won't get into his
[01:49:48.800 --> 01:49:53.120]  background but they're demonizing Ben Carson right look I have legitimate
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:58.080]  questions about Ben Carson's background just like I had about Obamas you know I
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:03.760]  wonder why if Carson tried to murder his mother murder a friend and hit someone
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:08.240]  over the head with a lock what happened what's his story I don't think Donald
[01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:13.960]  Trump's questions are out outrageous was I would think you don't get cured from
[01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:17.840]  that attempted murder by reading the Bible I'm assuming he probably was put
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:22.560]  on some kind of psychotropic drugs I think is a good whether that took place
[01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:26.400]  or not as a child whether he's still on them now those are legitimate questions
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:31.080]  for Obama we have legitimate questions when did you stop doing cocaine and
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:35.520]  marijuana like you you did in your youth stay there let's come back and get
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:41.160]  into the press not investigating Obama Joel Gilbert Joel Gilbert net he also
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:45.120]  has the sites dealing with who Obama's real father is if you don't get the

[01:54:13.520 --> 01:54:20.240]  it was a few months ago that I was downtown having dinner with my cousin
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:26.560]  Buckley Hammond and his wife and I heard shouting outside on Congress so I went
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:30.480]  out there and there were about 300 people with red flags hammers and sickles
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:38.200]  black lives matter kill the pigs signs only good pigs a dead pig and Muslim
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:43.040]  women and men women with their faces covered marching who were Muslim women
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:49.440]  and there were women with feminist signs too and we have video of that I think
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:54.840]  the headline was communist flags that black lives matter protest Austin is
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:59.560]  the name of the video the memory serves it's on YouTube Buckley ran outside with
[01:54:59.560 --> 01:55:05.680]  me we shot it on his iPhone and don't those quote feminist Marxists know that
[01:55:05.680 --> 01:55:09.360]  if the radical Islamists took over they would be able to leave the house and
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:12.800]  wear hoods over their heads I mean they don't let Muslim women demonstrate in
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:18.360]  places like Saudi Arabia I just don't get how you come here and you hate it or
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:22.080]  you get a free university education as we found out a bunch of these people
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:26.640]  were getting and it's just bizarre yeah there's the footage and you can go to
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:29.920]  the front of it see the red flags the communists leading it and the very same
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:33.440]  communists then came out to our pro-life demonstration them again screaming we
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:38.640]  love the devil we love being ugly we have hair under our arms you right
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.400]  wingers are gonna get it and yes we kill our babies and sticking their tongues
[01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:49.480]  out and you think what is wrong with these people and they're just crazy now I
[01:55:49.480 --> 01:55:52.600]  want to we have five more minutes now and five minutes the next segment and
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:55.840]  Joel Gilbert's got to go I had a mother guest joining us but Joel I know I was
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:59.320]  getting into the parallels between the way they treat Carson the way they
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:03.120]  treat Obama and his background but again just getting back to these spoiled
[01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:07.480]  rotten kids normally of wealthy middle-class people running around wanting
[01:56:07.480 --> 01:56:12.520]  to live under radical Islam slash communism these people need I mean really
[01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:16.040]  need to be punched on the nose and I'm sorry to talk like that but they're not
[01:56:16.040 --> 01:56:21.680]  living in the real world well they they live in an alternate reality that the
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:26.120]  president of the United States lives in and propagates every day through the
[01:56:26.120 --> 01:56:30.960]  tools of state through the IRS through the Josh Ernest through their media
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:35.920]  allies they're creating this alternate reality that people who were adults in
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:39.760]  the 60s I was you know just a little kid but they remember this same kind of
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:45.520]  anti-police anti-government anti-american rhetoric that they thought would lead to
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:49.480]  a takeover the United States and the creation of this paradise on earth
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:54.280]  conservatives and radicals see the world differently we look at America and we
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:58.000]  say America is the greatest country in the world compared to everywhere else
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:03.440]  this is as good as it gets it's not perfect but we love America leftists and
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:09.440]  radicals compare America to a socialist utopia a paradise and they say it
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:13.560]  doesn't measure up to paradise so we have to tear it down destroy it and try to
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:17.800]  build a paradise on earth and that's the difference in thinking finishing up in
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:22.360]  the few minutes we have left in the next segment they still worship Obama even
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:27.640]  though he screwed him over unfortunately he's got a hold on them I think if you
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:30.840]  look at my film there's no place like utopia I do talk to a lot of African
[01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:35.040]  Americans in Detroit Chicago all over the country and the first thing they'll
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:39.960]  tell me is you know Republicans are racist Obama they love Obama but after
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:43.680]  I talked to him for about two minutes it didn't take two minutes till they all
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:48.120]  were like well wait a minute we don't want our kids smoking marijuana we don't
[01:57:48.120 --> 01:57:52.760]  want illegals coming taking our jobs we don't want any of this radical nonsense
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:57.280]  agenda we're religious people we believe in God so once you can dialogue with
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:01.280]  them and I hope that's what Republican candidates will do it's pretty easy to see
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:05.520]  that some of the biggest conservatives in America today are African Americans
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:10.880]  that have been living in the Democratic hell holes well also Hispanics two
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:13.520]  thirds don't want open borders no kidding they're more conservative than the
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:17.800]  average dumb white yuppie yep absolutely but the Republicans won't
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:21.760]  communicate that to them they just they just sit there and like act like the
[01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:26.520]  fake liberal view of the world is reality well I think hopefully it'll turn
[01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:29.400]  around there are some presidential candidates that I think can take the
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:34.360]  argument all over the country and I want to see who you like back in 70 seconds
[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:37.960]  Joe Gilbert and more of the Obama above the law garbage the media won't look at
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:40.520]  the background
[01:58:40.520 --> 01:58:47.120]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[02:00:18.720 --> 02:00:26.280]  Texas Alex Jones. Steve Quill's coming on to give us his take on the Islamic Jihad

[02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:39.040]  break. Other key points you'd like to relay to folks in the time we have left
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:44.480]  together. Yeah going back to Obama's biography I want to point to Obama
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:49.960]  writing in his book that when push comes to shove after 9-11 he said when push
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:54.200]  comes to shove between Americans and Muslims I will stand with the Muslims
[02:00:54.200 --> 02:01:00.880]  he made this very clear his book is a partial roadmap to understanding his
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:04.280]  policies the parts that are hidden which I've exposed in Dreams for my real
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:09.280]  father his real biological father who was his ideological mentor throughout his
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:14.600]  life was the radical communist Frank Marshall Davis he was anti-white anti
[02:01:14.600 --> 02:01:20.200]  American pro-Soviet Obama's pro-Russian policies everything can be tied to
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:26.160]  Frank Marshall Davis I encourage everyone to look at it and as I said
[02:01:26.160 --> 02:01:29.560]  Ben Carson does deserve scrutiny but the media should have gone out to Hawaii
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:34.840]  like I did twice and looked into Obama's background and I think I put together a
[02:01:34.840 --> 02:01:39.160]  comprehensive view of what his real politics are based on his real history
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:46.240]  who he is and his DNA as an American radical now you speak about Russia this
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:49.640]  may be an area we disagree some on I mean I see Russia getting out of the
[02:01:49.640 --> 02:01:54.600]  clutches to a great extent of Marxism promoting Christianity family not really
[02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:59.160]  even expanding its borders and really starting to attack ISIS which Obama
[02:01:59.160 --> 02:02:03.560]  should be doing I understand that Obama was pro-Soviet and has even made such
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:07.520]  statements but do you think this is all the Russians plan possum right now I
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:13.240]  think the Russians have an agenda in the Mediterranean in the Black Sea area and
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:17.760]  in the you know Eastern Mediterranean they want to reestablish their bases
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:22.960]  there they intend to prop up Assad the goal is not to defeat ISIS that's the
[02:02:22.960 --> 02:02:28.080]  excuse for them to enter the area and and create another presence in that
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:32.040]  region knowing that United States has withdrawn and has no interest in
[02:02:32.040 --> 02:02:36.920]  influencing the region and is leaving it our ally Israel on it on its own so they
[02:02:36.920 --> 02:02:43.280]  have their own agenda which I think they're using the ISIS excuse to execute
[02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:50.080]  but I don't see Russia today as the fount of collectivism and communism and
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:54.080]  corruption I see Europe and the United States and communist China as the fount
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:03:00.640]  well I think Russia is still a even though it's not Marxist in nature it is a
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:04.600]  bastion of anti-Americanism that it carried over from the Soviet era and
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:09.600]  they will oppose our interests oppose our allies support enemies of our allies
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:13.960]  and try to cut America off from our natural allies in Western Europe the
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:19.240]  United States cannot exist as a you know loan democracy between two oceans we
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:25.320]  have to have strong democratic allies in Europe Israel Japan Australia and Russia
[02:03:25.320 --> 02:03:30.240]  I think we'll speak to along with China will speak to neutralize those
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:35.000]  alliances because of the geography oil for any number of reasons to continue to
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:39.520]  isolate the United States so they can dominate us both militarily but
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:44.800]  economically they want to the dollar not to be the the standard currency for the
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:47.880]  world sure and our leaders devaluing and are opening the door for that but
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:51.960]  you're right the Chinese and others just got entrance into the World Reserve
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:56.520]  currency market and you can see the bricks and the rest of it lining up
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:04:01.760]  against the United States right now and you can see really a schizophrenic
[02:04:01.760 --> 02:04:04.760]  policy where they do some things that are good for the US other things that
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:08.280]  aren't on things for sure this is a very interesting time to be alive Joel
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:12.920]  Gilbert well it's interesting but it's also fraught with danger the United
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:18.120]  States must lead and dominate the world to for peace to be maintained and for
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:21.800]  our interest to be maintained in the security of our allies as long as
[02:04:21.800 --> 02:04:27.680]  Barack Obama is in office the United States remains in grave danger well I
[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:30.480]  know this they say their number one terror threat is conservatives and
[02:04:30.480 --> 02:04:35.840]  libertarians and veterans and there's no threat to bring in unlimited people from
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:40.240]  war-torn areas full of jihadis does show a real disconnect and I'm just trying
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:43.480]  to understand the ideology that's so self-destructive I mean these elites
[02:04:43.480 --> 02:04:48.040]  run America why would they want to tear it to pieces it's it's self-destructive
[02:04:48.040 --> 02:04:51.920]  go Gilbert thank you so much for joining us thanks for having me today we'll be
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:59.240]  back with Steve quail straight ahead I'm Alex Jones info wars dot com a man has

[02:05:35.160 --> 02:05:38.720]  found sifting through prescription pills so limbo trained his gun on the
[02:05:38.720 --> 02:05:43.080]  intruder and warned him not to move as he called 911 the thief did move however
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:47.440]  in was shot in the shoulder days later limbo was contacted by Stanford

[02:08:30.880 --> 02:08:35.360]  thank you so much for joining us steve quail is one of the original founders
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:39.240]  of the prep movement he's been on talk radio more than 20 years now he's a
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:44.520]  best-selling author steve quail dot com and i wanted to get him to pop in for
[02:08:44.520 --> 02:08:49.000]  two segments today we appreciate him doing that to give his take and his
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:54.320]  analysis from his research and his sources on what this signifies with the
[02:08:54.320 --> 02:08:59.640]  west bringing in millions of refugees into europe first obama said ten
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:04.480]  thousand now it's a hundred thousand plus refugees into the united states with
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:10.320]  fake passports the majority of them undoubtedly this is sleeper cells being
[02:09:10.320 --> 02:09:13.360]  brought in undoubtedly they know terror attacks are coming we've already seen a
[02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:18.760]  bunch of them what is the end game of this and how do the politicians think
[02:09:18.760 --> 02:09:23.880]  they're going to get away with allowing these attacks to take place that's what
[02:09:23.880 --> 02:09:27.480]  i wanted to get steve quail's take on steve quail thanks for joining us what
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:30.640]  do you think's going on here well thank you alex i think this is the
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:35.600]  integration of the ultimate illuminous globalist plan for global war and global
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:40.560]  civil war civil war meaning in all nations that we're seeing whether it's
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:44.800]  europe whether it's parts of asia and the united states we're being set up for
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:50.360]  the ultimate takedown of obviously borders language culture the globalists
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:54.640]  have made their plans very clear we're watching it right now and i think what
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:58.480]  people have to ask the question on the whole french thing you know standard
[02:09:58.480 --> 02:10:02.880]  protocol and counterterrorism you can talk to the experts read about it is
[02:10:02.880 --> 02:10:08.080]  the longer they wait once people start being up the first shots are fired the
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:13.440]  more danger put the hostage and you've got to ask yourself why did they not rush
[02:10:13.440 --> 02:10:17.680]  the building why did they allow it to go on even when people were texting and
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:22.240]  phoning out of the building i think that this is the cost is your as you
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:26.080]  probably know alex the french foreign legion now is boots on the ground in
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:32.520]  syria it's becoming more and more obvious that the issue the major issue is
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:38.880]  simply this this is not immigration this is invasion the pathetic excuse of the
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:43.000]  entity in the white house when he said that uh... you know ices was contained
[02:10:43.000 --> 02:10:46.960]  in them boom and then the other statement that he made through his press
[02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:52.440]  conference in turkey should be absolute a declaration that he is overseeing and
[02:10:52.440 --> 02:10:58.280]  allowing the islamic invasion of the united states and basically funding yet
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:01.800]  in other parts of world you know that's what vladimir putin putin spoke the
[02:11:01.800 --> 02:11:06.040]  most telling and compelling statement he said look what you have done but i don't
[02:11:06.040 --> 02:11:11.600]  think people understand this is not by accident and this is not by someone who
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:16.120]  is so removed from reality he knows exactly what he's doing he knows that
[02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:20.920]  there must be a war that has to take place for islamic eschatology to be to
[02:11:20.920 --> 02:11:24.240]  be fulfilled a global nuclear war you remember you and i did a show together
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:27.760]  when i'm a dean and job made the statement that for the sake of the
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:32.240]  return the money it'd be beneficial for fifty four million iranians that they
[02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:36.320]  had to die to bring it about well he got thrown out because there must be more
[02:11:36.320 --> 02:11:40.920]  than one who said we don't want this guy president more but the point is to set
[02:11:40.920 --> 02:11:47.120]  with balalay and uh... mc macklehenry and others calling now saying something's
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:51.680]  wrong we have a constitutional definition of treason aiding embedding a sworn
[02:11:51.680 --> 02:11:55.960]  enemy the united states we have denial upon denial upon denial but alex i
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:00.080]  proposed to you that all the weapons you and i've talked about all of the
[02:12:00.080 --> 02:12:05.200]  ammunition that has been purchased has been uh... secreted away in different
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:10.280]  places throughout the united states and will be for the invading army to acquire
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:15.160]  i think alex we are under invasion this is not immigration and the uh... the
[02:12:15.160 --> 02:12:20.120]  threats of ice this and let's just face it you know i've talked so many years
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:25.240]  that terrorism is nothing more than an extension of someone's foreign policy in
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:30.240]  this case the terrorist and the over throw of the old world order we've heard
[02:12:30.240 --> 02:12:34.280]  it from george bush ad nauseam and the point being now is we're seeing
[02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:37.160]  implementation and unfortunately
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:41.840]  uh... with the veterans being killed off three hundred fifty thousand plus
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:46.760]  denial of medical services etc since obama came to office now nine hundred
[02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:50.760]  thousand plus veterans waiting it's got to be obvious to everybody that we're
[02:12:50.760 --> 02:12:56.200]  seeing the uh... decimation of the u.s. military we're seeing the if you will
[02:12:56.200 --> 02:13:01.280]  throwing uh... the americans under the bus and it's a war it's civil war
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:05.400]  uh... when you see that the statements out of obon look you don't need to make
[02:13:05.400 --> 02:13:07.560]  anything up you don't need to
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:11.880]  going long uh... long-winded television network not that you do but the
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:14.600]  television networks they're trying to figure everything out and it's so
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:18.660]  obvious and one of the things about people is is that they're so
[02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:22.560]  numbed and dumbed down to reality they can't get out of their
[02:13:22.560 --> 02:13:24.600]  entertainment if you will
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:30.280]  uh... uh... paradigm and come to reality knowing that this is the beginning
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:34.160]  of the end and i'd be you know you know i'd be we used to do talk radio together
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:38.840]  years and years ago actually decades but it was always tougher people to come to
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:42.280]  the conclusion that the united states would still be standing because we're
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:43.240]  not patriots
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:47.600]  and up gun owners enough of this and up about but unfortunately the people that
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:51.600]  should have stood up didn't the people that uh... even now should stand up a
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:54.240]  wall analysis i was going to ask you a question today
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:57.840]  how many people united states all your listeners our listeners
[02:13:57.840 --> 02:14:01.480]  all the listeners they get it have you ever tried to put a number on that
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:03.400]  realistically put a number on it
[02:14:03.400 --> 02:14:09.280]  of hardcore people in the u.s. that are really awake and tune into my show
[02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:13.360]  maybe maybe ten million
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:18.200]  and and the thing is i was going to say somewhere between three and seven okay
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:22.320]  so three and seven is still close to two percent of the world's population how
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:23.360]  is it
[02:14:23.360 --> 02:14:26.560]  i'm not world's population u.s. population how is it
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:29.200]  with that many people in the know
[02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:34.520]  are we still electing or are the traders being elected well they just don't know
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:37.720]  what to do just like you and i we know what's happening
[02:14:37.720 --> 02:14:40.520]  but we sit here peacefully trying to warn people
[02:14:40.520 --> 02:14:44.680]  and i mean look at the irs persecuting and arresting and and and and going
[02:14:44.680 --> 02:14:45.840]  after
[02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:49.640]  more than ten thousand organizations they admit had done nothing
[02:14:49.640 --> 02:14:53.920]  veterans groups gun groups christian groups and we put up with that
[02:14:53.920 --> 02:14:57.520]  and i ask myself have i done enough i mean is there some physical line in the
[02:14:57.520 --> 02:14:58.280]  sand
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:01.400]  but then i realize that we get physical they'll spend that
[02:15:01.400 --> 02:15:05.800]  uh... but at a certain point it's just so out of control
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:08.040]  the border patrol is on tv saying
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:11.880]  we've been ordered secretly to smuggle illegals and
[02:15:11.880 --> 02:15:15.240]  we complete the smuggling process this is treason
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:17.440]  this is an occupied government
[02:15:17.440 --> 02:15:19.600]  it is treason so we are a nation
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:22.800]  under occupation i woke up the other morning i think yesterday
[02:15:22.800 --> 02:15:24.240]  but the day before
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:28.680]  and it the bottom line is these words just kept ringing in my ears and you know
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:31.440]  got up walked around went back to bed and
[02:15:31.440 --> 02:15:34.280]  and it basically was just a simple statement
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:37.360]  america you will lose everything
[02:15:37.360 --> 02:15:41.160]  and so the point is is our freedoms are pretty well gone you and i can
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:44.800]  quote the declaration we can quote the constitution we carry pop constitution
[02:15:44.800 --> 02:15:47.560]  was the last thing they're going to take away is the chicken feed the
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:48.440]  entertainment
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:51.600]  and when they take all the little bobbles and chicken feet away
[02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:54.280]  what are the giant masses of trend he's going to do
[02:15:54.280 --> 02:15:56.360]  they're gonna say to the government hollywood
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:59.840]  will do anything you say just give us chicken feet again
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:01.080]  and they'll say okay
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:04.800]  go along with arresting the christians the patriots and the veterans
[02:16:04.800 --> 02:16:06.960]  and the giant masses of scum
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:10.400]  will call for the ten percent of us to be arrested
[02:16:10.400 --> 02:16:14.000]  absolutely and i they won't be happy with the arrest you know it's always been
[02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:14.520]  like
[02:16:14.520 --> 02:16:16.800]  look if you compare the contemporary
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:19.400]  presidency with the reign of near oh okay
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:21.840]  obviously they didn't have eighteen uh...
[02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:25.240]  uh... whole golf courses in your own day and maybe he would have been out on
[02:16:25.240 --> 02:16:26.520]  the course putting
[02:16:26.520 --> 02:16:29.360]  instead of you know fiddling or whatever you're doing well he didn't have a
[02:16:29.360 --> 02:16:31.680]  palace the size of the golf course
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:34.320]  yeah you got it and the point is that that
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:38.160]  we're we're we're now in the bullseye and see this is what it's where the
[02:16:38.160 --> 02:16:40.600]  coliseum is today i'm sorry go ahead
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:43.000]  we were we're to the point right now
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:45.760]  where we are under full
[02:16:45.760 --> 02:16:50.120]  identification by the powers of the poor destruction i was made the statement
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:53.120]  for twenty five years i'm only saying in retrospect
[02:16:53.120 --> 02:16:57.040]  when it comes time to kill the christians when it comes time to kill the
[02:16:57.040 --> 02:16:59.360]  patriots when it comes time it will be done
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:01.120]  what during rock concerts
[02:17:01.120 --> 02:17:04.880]  uh... the band of the day will be on the stage and the guillotines will be
[02:17:04.880 --> 02:17:07.120]  chopping away instead of that
[02:17:07.120 --> 02:17:11.480]  people would prefer to basically say oh don't bother me i know people out you
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:12.280]  know people
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:16.200]  we probably know more people that have the attitude i don't want to
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:17.720]  to quote barbara bush
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:19.840]  uh... clutter my beautiful mind
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:22.960]  well it's one thing to clutter your beautiful mind is another thing to have
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:26.640]  your life taken from you it's nothing to have your family rob from you
[02:17:26.640 --> 02:17:29.560]  it's nothing to have your children taken from you and these people are
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:30.800]  monsters
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:32.820]  alex that's the thing that is

[02:24:48.720 --> 02:24:54.440]  Federal Trade Commission the Department of Defense and others I'll talk about
[02:24:54.440 --> 02:24:57.680]  this at the start of the next segment going back to Steve quail Steve across
[02:24:57.680 --> 02:25:03.320]  the board they have now announced in Congress and at the FCC that indeed they
[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:07.920]  are looking at quote restricting Matt drudges free speech by name that means
[02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:11.480]  they can get drudge everybody else it doesn't matter it's the second amendment
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:15.000]  the first amendment the right to supplements their drop in the hammer I
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:21.040]  mean every sign is the big storm is coming Steve quail it's here Alex well
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:26.680]  you know when Matt drudges on your show and obviously the whole outcome of that
[02:25:26.680 --> 02:25:31.000]  when he said it's been a good 20 year run I don't think people understand let me
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:35.640]  make it easy let me make it really easy when your freedom dies you're next to die
[02:25:35.640 --> 02:25:42.040]  see this is what is so egregious to me Alex we're pleading with people to wake
[02:25:42.040 --> 02:25:46.480]  up your beef all the videos you produce all the shows I've been on all the books
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:50.080]  I've written and it's not just about you and I but what I'm saying is is that
[02:25:50.080 --> 02:25:54.680]  that all the work most people go to drudge because it gets the whole world
[02:25:54.680 --> 02:26:00.220]  instantly at your fingertips yet what people don't understand is it's no
[02:26:00.220 --> 02:26:05.200]  longer over here they're coming at us they take away your nutrition they take
[02:26:05.200 --> 02:26:08.680]  away your health they're going to control food they're going to make food look I
[02:26:08.680 --> 02:26:12.920]  said this this is who there will be a capital offense to basically have a
[02:26:12.920 --> 02:26:16.680]  Bible it will be a capital offense to name the name of Jesus it'll be a
[02:26:16.680 --> 02:26:21.520]  capital offense to have a weapon and meanwhile imagine this imagine the ants
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:25.920]  that you saw in that video all the Syrians just pouring into Germany
[02:26:25.920 --> 02:26:31.640]  imagine the image of a carcass being overrun with ants okay you've seen it
[02:26:31.640 --> 02:26:36.000]  in the past motion cameras it just devours a thing in a matter of seconds
[02:26:36.000 --> 02:26:39.440]  it didn't take that long takes longer but that's what we're watching we're
[02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:44.200]  watching the horse it's the sound of grasshopper wings this is just literally
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:48.640]  out of the book of Revelation and by the way this is Ezekiel 38 people can mock
[02:26:48.640 --> 02:26:53.920]  the Bible they can deny the Bible but we're out right now is global war is
[02:26:53.920 --> 02:26:58.080]  getting ready to happen and we've seen the most sophisticated weaponry in the
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:27:02.600]  world both in most mainline analysts say they believe World War 3 or World War
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:06.720]  4 because the Pentagon calls the last war Cold War World War 3 they they said
[02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:09.560]  they believe it's gonna happen I hope that's not the case but when so many
[02:27:09.560 --> 02:27:13.480]  mainline analysts agree with Steve Quill what's that mean well it means that you
[02:27:13.480 --> 02:27:17.720]  know it means that there comes a time when mocking the messenger will no
[02:27:17.720 --> 02:27:24.040]  longer prevent the ramification of the truth okay you know the point is is that
[02:27:24.040 --> 02:27:30.080]  these kiss the enemy's posterior communists and let's just talk about this
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:33.840]  this is a complete communist revolution being taken over it's being
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:37.800]  instigated and it's being overseen and funded and when you've got the guy come
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:41.960]  on the screen and say you know America I don't care if America wins anymore hey
[02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:46.440]  hello ladies and gentlemen everybody all those people out there and you kids not
[02:27:46.440 --> 02:27:51.040]  a question of we can't vote the right guy in Alex it's too late for that I'm
[02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:55.640]  not a fatalist but you know this you you've poured your heart out you've poured
[02:27:55.640 --> 02:28:00.040]  everything that made Alex Jones Alex Jones you've you've laid it you know I
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:04.760]  your energy level is exemplary that's not flattery that's just true but at the
[02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:11.640]  end of the day are being overrun and when free speech dies everyone dies who
[02:28:11.640 --> 02:28:15.480]  has ever ever thought that there'd be any such thing as a truth you've got a
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:21.360]  nation of zombies and and when they take away the nutritional supplements and
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:26.080]  that which keeps people alive wait until you get to eat the super silent green
[02:28:26.080 --> 02:28:30.440]  and I'm not kidding if we're already eating baby parts and mutagenic
[02:28:30.440 --> 02:28:35.320]  substances in the food I mean they really really do they being the
[02:28:35.320 --> 02:28:39.760]  globalist the Illuminous the Luciferians consider all of us zombies and you know
[02:28:39.760 --> 02:28:45.040]  what look at what people are doing and look at what they're not doing you cannot
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:52.320]  stay as a spectator this is one time where a spectators will die first saying
[02:28:52.320 --> 02:28:56.240]  that you've got two choices you draw your line in the sand and you quit
[02:28:56.240 --> 02:29:00.400]  listening to the kiss the devil's bottom people that just want to get along have a
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:06.120]  group to hug sing kumbaya and and go to dead churches and dead pulpits that
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:10.720]  absolutely have no life we are in the end of the age not the end of the world I
[02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:15.280]  want to make that clear and it only gets worse from here so now it is basically
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:19.400]  people prepare to defend yourself as one of my friends who lives in Texas said
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:23.720]  get your head out of the ground in other places and get them on your sights you
[02:29:23.720 --> 02:29:28.800]  have to decide what is worth fighting for an Alex if people won't even fight

[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:37.720]  being raped and pillaged and they won't fight for anything because they've been
[02:29:37.720 --> 02:29:41.320]  turning to zombies first the problem the new order is we're not all zombies

[02:33:24.840 --> 02:33:28.320]  situation with the terror attacks are they real are they false flag I
[02:33:28.320 --> 02:33:33.080]  respect his opinion his view his sources are amazing he formerly headed up a
[02:33:33.080 --> 02:33:35.720]  lot of the anti-terrorism operations at the state department he also ran
[02:33:35.720 --> 02:33:39.480]  psyops one of the first big things he did was the can't david accords he
[02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:43.800]  admits they admit he was the main psychiatrist on all that and helped get
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:47.880]  that accord signed co-wrote a bunch of books with tom clancy and others ran
[02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:51.920]  special ops operations was involved in the founding of delta force and more a
[02:33:51.920 --> 02:33:55.000]  frequent guest here so we need to introduce him we'll be talking to him
[02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:58.480]  here in a moment about his take on the situation then the fourth hour david
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:03.000]  night takes over they'll be taking calls has some special guest and more
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:09.280]  today I don't expect this to be about us though I was told a few months ago by
[02:34:09.280 --> 02:34:14.280]  high-level sources that coming in that late November December that I was part
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:20.760]  of a doj investigation into supplements which is basically unprecedented now
[02:34:20.760 --> 02:34:24.760]  everything we put out is what they call FDA grass certified meaning it's
[02:34:24.760 --> 02:34:29.880]  recognized as safe in the herb family that's a big number one we've had
[02:34:29.880 --> 02:34:35.120]  multiple top lawyers here we've had other industry experts here we use three
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:40.880]  of the biggest and most successful manufacturing facilities in the country
[02:34:40.880 --> 02:34:44.440]  we used two of the biggest and another one that's middle-sized that has some
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:48.560]  of the best records out there we then neurotically double and triple check
[02:34:48.560 --> 02:34:56.080]  with outside firms everything we sell even though we are quote relabelers we
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:00.880]  don't manufacture some of the formulas are ours but technically we are relabelers
[02:35:00.880 --> 02:35:05.960]  doesn't matter we go to the level of manufacturers ourselves knowing we're a
[02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:10.880]  target but in this season it doesn't matter they're coming after everything in
[02:35:10.880 --> 02:35:15.280]  Europe under the UN they're trying to ban medium dosages of vitamin D vitamin A
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:20.920]  and vitamin C they're not playing games and here is the Reuters headline DOJ to
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:24.520]  announce actions against dietary supplement makers now from insiders
[02:35:24.520 --> 02:35:30.200]  they expect this is separate and it's going to be about supposedly some of
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:33.720]  these dietary supplements that they can tie into the Olympics and claim are part
[02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:37.400]  of blood doping and claim to have an infetament effect and they want to
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:40.600]  restrict energy drinks and stuff like that they want to get into food in
[02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:46.840]  general you can't find legitimately more than a couple deaths a year from what
[02:35:46.840 --> 02:35:50.760]  you could call supplements it's one of the safest industries out there this
[02:35:50.760 --> 02:35:54.280]  has nothing to do with protecting the public you have hundreds of thousands
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:57.400]  of bad interactions a year forty something thousand deaths a year they
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:01.520]  admit from big pharma and I'm not saying all the big farmers bad either it's just
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:05.480]  that you know drugs have side effects a lot of natural herbs and things don't
[02:36:05.480 --> 02:36:08.280]  like vitamin C doesn't have a side effect because we eat too much of it you
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:11.440]  might get diarrhea if you eat like you know ten thousand times the recommended
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:17.480]  dose so this is just all part of the larger assault one of the biggest ways
[02:36:17.480 --> 02:36:21.960]  we fund ourselves is nutraceuticals whether it's essential oils that are
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:26.920]  in the lung cleanse or whether it's the liver shield that's a cleanse or whether
[02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:31.680]  it's the living defense that flushes out the harmful organisms parasite stuff
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:35.560]  like that this is all known stuff for thousands of years to have these effects
[02:36:35.560 --> 02:36:39.800]  at very very low prices take our product knockout it's nine ingredients
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:45.160]  I'll trip to fan melatonin valerian root and other things at the recommended
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:49.760]  dose that synergistically together really helps me sleep deeper have more
[02:36:49.760 --> 02:36:54.160]  rest will sleep I mean good luck making something up about that what are you
[02:36:54.160 --> 02:36:59.600]  gonna say it's 1695 on sale right now normally 1995 a bottle of the same dose
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:08.680]  just of melatonin cost in 1995 so we put eight other things in there good
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:14.720]  dosages healthy dosages and it's not any more money that's what we do it in
[02:37:14.720 --> 02:37:20.240]  full wars life calm and it's why so many of the big vitamin type experts love
[02:37:20.240 --> 02:37:24.240]  our products they get such great third-party reviews because I have the
[02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:28.040]  scientists the researchers at these big firms coming up with their dream
[02:37:28.040 --> 02:37:34.560]  products so other people don't do this other people don't put $18 of product
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:38.640]  in something that costs $40 or they don't put $10 of product in something
[02:37:38.640 --> 02:37:42.440]  that costs $25 we still mark it up we got to pay the bills but most
[02:37:42.440 --> 02:37:47.280]  supplements are marked up seven times it's all advertising it's all packaging
[02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:51.520]  not with us folks these are real game changers words whether it's our special
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:57.040]  nasa niadine x2 you name it super mill vitality now I wasn't announced this

[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:10.000]  Steve Pachennick.com we're going to find out his view on what's happening
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:15.120]  geopolitically in the world and what these Friday the 13th attacks mean Steve
[02:39:15.120 --> 02:39:21.520]  Pachennick.com he's an MD and a PhD and of course I've been involved in many of
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:25.040]  the more famous black ops operations and many operations you never heard about
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:30.320]  so he's uniquely suited to give us his take and his inside view on what's
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:34.160]  happening so Steve Pachennick thank you for coming on doc. Oh it's always a
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:37.840]  pleasure coming on and it's always a pleasure to hear even quail's voice I
[02:39:37.840 --> 02:39:42.880]  haven't heard it in years and I I worked with him in Montana so it's quite a
[02:39:42.880 --> 02:39:48.200]  interesting family we have yeah basically from my point of view and
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:53.200]  running a hostage negotiation about the first time I started the first hostage
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:58.720]  negotiation in Washington DC in 78 it was with the Hanafi Muslims black Muslims
[02:39:58.720 --> 02:40:05.080]  and they also protested the appearance of a movie about Mohammed and they asked to
[02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:09.120]  shut it down they also killed quite a few people in three different sites we
[02:40:09.120 --> 02:40:13.680]  had five did 500 hostages and I was brought in because the FBI couldn't
[02:40:13.680 --> 02:40:18.560]  handle it the CIA couldn't handle it in the military was not available the point
[02:40:18.560 --> 02:40:24.120]  of fact is that I was able to negotiate their release some 40 years later we
[02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:29.440]  have the same problem the problem isn't just black Muslims because Muslims is a
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:35.720]  wide-ranging factor we have Muslims in Indonesia we have Muslims in Malaysia
[02:40:35.720 --> 02:40:40.040]  and Shiite Muslims what we're talking about here specifically the Sunnis and
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:45.040]  ISIS and ISIS from my point of view came into their France for reasons other
[02:40:45.040 --> 02:40:50.520]  than their dislike of Christianity or anything to do with the Quran from my
[02:40:50.520 --> 02:40:54.560]  point of view one of the issues that I was concerned about and was true to form
[02:40:54.560 --> 02:40:58.200]  because I predicted there will be Algerians and Pakistani control
[02:40:58.200 --> 02:41:02.280]  operatives and it turned out to be correct that the people involved in the
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:07.120]  and the attacks were either the sons of Algerians or Dalgerians themselves now
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:14.880]  why Algerians because for over 30 40 50 years the French have incarcerated over
[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:19.680]  2 million Algerians in their camps in the internment camps both in Paris and
[02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:24.600]  France around my area in Toulouse and in Algeria and what's happened in effect
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:29.240]  contrary to the image of a sweet innocent beatific France and I'm not
[02:41:29.240 --> 02:41:33.720]  saying that France deserves it I'm simply stating a fact which no one stated
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:37.120]  either in France of the United States and none of our intelligence opera sure
[02:41:37.120 --> 02:41:41.800]  they got thrown out of Algeria in the battle for Algiers correct but no one
[02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:46.240]  knows to what degree it really occurred when I grew up in France in the south
[02:41:46.240 --> 02:41:51.640]  of west of France in Toulouse I was privy to explosions all day long and the
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:55.960]  explosions were created either by Algerian operatives or created by the
[02:41:55.960 --> 02:42:00.320]  generals who were fighting against the goal and the famous film the Jackal
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:05.240]  shows you exactly to what extent people wanted to go to kill Charles de Gaulle
[02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:09.840]  because they were disgusted in France with the fact that they had a pull out of
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:14.920]  Algeria a converse of that is that these are the people involved in these
[02:42:14.920 --> 02:42:21.600]  attacks against France Belgium Spain and in Lebanon are the children of the
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:26.080]  children who were in the Algerian war and the Moroccan wars in the in the wars
[02:42:26.080 --> 02:42:31.880]  involving the colonial empires so under the guise of the Quran or Islamism
[02:42:31.880 --> 02:42:35.480]  extremism Islamism which most of them don't really know none of them have
[02:42:35.480 --> 02:42:39.880]  really been students of the Quran they don't know Islam and I'm not pardoning
[02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:45.440]  them I'm simply saying that they came in to justify the revenge that they were
[02:42:45.440 --> 02:42:51.000]  that they were told to inflict by the their fathers their grandfathers which
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:55.920]  in fact said listen France has been terrible to our people in Algeria here
[02:42:55.920 --> 02:43:00.160]  in France and elsewhere it's not an accident that they came out of Belgium
[02:43:00.160 --> 02:43:06.360]  Belgium knew very well that there was a Nidus or a group of operatives who
[02:43:06.360 --> 02:43:11.400]  extreme Islamist in this town called milk comp it's a town which is in the
[02:43:11.400 --> 02:43:16.080]  suburbs I don't know it as well as I know friends are there right now okay
[02:43:16.080 --> 02:43:19.600]  well what the reason why Belgium is important and we you and I actually
[02:43:19.600 --> 02:43:24.080]  talked about it many years ago is that Belgium ironically is not a unified
[02:43:24.080 --> 02:43:30.280]  nation although it has the audacity to take over the EU as the center point
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:36.360]  Belgium itself is broken up into the flams the Walloons French Flemish and
[02:43:36.360 --> 02:43:40.800]  other cultures and they had a very high hard time for years getting a prime
[02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:46.160]  minister or a leader that country so in fact it's very easy for extremists of
[02:43:46.160 --> 02:43:50.360]  any type to go into Belgium and then travel across the border one hour later
[02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:54.840]  into France I don't think this is a stand-down I don't think this is a false
[02:43:54.840 --> 02:44:00.120]  flag but I what I do want to encourage our audience to understand is we have to
[02:44:00.120 --> 02:44:04.840]  take it easy it's not a question that we are in a high alert and we're on the
[02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:11.440]  war on terror terror is a strategic and tactical mechanism which is intended to
[02:44:11.440 --> 02:44:16.560]  create fear and no one feeds into that fear better than our American media and
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:21.080]  the world media where they amp it up to an amazing volume and then you would
[02:44:21.080 --> 02:44:25.400]  think you're totally paralyzed the truth of the matter is we've had terrorism
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:29.560]  from the beginning of time we were terrorists in the Revolutionary War
[02:44:29.560 --> 02:44:33.360]  against the British the French were terrorists so that it's a technique
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:37.840]  that's being developed is our intelligence and our FBI and our
[02:44:37.840 --> 02:44:44.640]  military up to the the level that it needs to impenetrate these groups my
[02:44:44.640 --> 02:44:49.200]  opinion quite frankly is no and for years we have wasted a lot of money
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:54.360]  trillions of dollars in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan we have not won
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:45:00.040]  anything we basically have wasted that war wasted our capital and bombing these
[02:45:00.040 --> 02:45:04.360]  groups and ISIS is totally useless well that's where I want to go next it's a
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:09.360]  very confusing the situation in Syria it's been pretty clear up until the last
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:13.640]  few months who was on whose side the West was backing a lot of these ISIS and
[02:45:13.640 --> 02:45:18.000]  al-Qaeda al-Nusra groups now it appears they might actually be cutting them off
[02:45:18.000 --> 02:45:21.400]  and bombing him is that because they didn't serve their purpose successfully
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:24.920]  or is it because they become an embarrassment is it because Putin came
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:30.360]  in or is it still a fake war did ISIS strike back through these North
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:34.720]  African groups as a threat to France for bombing them I mean as best you can
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:39.920]  tell them from your sources how is this really connected to Syria this is very
[02:45:39.920 --> 02:45:44.040]  much connected to Syria because number one everyone has to understand that
[02:45:44.040 --> 02:45:49.240]  Bashar Assad and the Assad or the Alawites these are the minority groups of
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:55.080]  Shiites were placed into power from that the from the internal part of Syria
[02:45:55.080 --> 02:46:00.040]  right to the Mediterranean and basically an Aleppo and Latakia I was there in
[02:46:00.040 --> 02:46:05.680]  Syria so the French created modern-day Syria the second thing is the Shiites
[02:46:05.680 --> 02:46:11.600]  I eat the Iranian Revolutionary Guard led by General Sulamani the Russians and
[02:46:11.600 --> 02:46:16.360]  the most importantly are the Hezbollah 8,000 young men from Lebanon who
[02:46:16.360 --> 02:46:21.240]  literally go 10 minutes away and fight ISIS the truth of the matter is that the
[02:46:21.240 --> 02:46:26.400]  only vigil and the only effective counter force that we have against ISIS is
[02:46:26.400 --> 02:46:32.040]  not America it's not the bombing it's primarily the Iranian Revolutionary
[02:46:32.040 --> 02:46:36.920]  Guard the Bashar's forces military forces that are supported by the Russians
[02:46:36.920 --> 02:46:41.880]  and the Hezbollah young men and women who've been fighting ISIS for well over
[02:46:41.880 --> 02:46:47.280]  four to five years in Lebanon because literally ISIS is outside their homes so
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:51.280]  how are things going for ISIS and now the French claim they're gonna send the
[02:46:51.280 --> 02:46:55.720]  French foreign legion into there well I would say the following I know the French
[02:46:55.720 --> 02:46:59.560]  foreign legion because they were trained in the town where my family grew up in
[02:46:59.560 --> 02:47:04.960]  in Corsica the French foreign legion is technically not part of the French army
[02:47:04.960 --> 02:47:10.800]  they are in my opinion one of the most ruthless effective forces in the other
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:15.040]  world because they are not part of the French army if the Hollande would have
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:18.880]  tell me it's the French army I would not have the same opinion because my father
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:22.440]  was in the French army they were defeated in World War two they defeated in
[02:47:22.440 --> 02:47:26.760]  World War one however the French foreign legion brings in Germans
[02:47:26.760 --> 02:47:31.000]  Austrians and all types of criminals who want to have a French passport they're
[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:35.280]  exceedingly effective at what they do is sniping and a killing at that point
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:39.800]  plank range so the French foreign legion is a unit that I would have brought in
[02:47:39.800 --> 02:47:44.360]  right it's a legion of assassins is it not a legion of assassins well it that's
[02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:48.800]  what war is I mean these are guys who are controlled a disciplined highly
[02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:54.400]  effective assassins if I were Isis and really I'm not that good from the Isis
[02:47:54.400 --> 02:47:58.040]  point of view from the point of view of what was said in the media you think
[02:47:58.040 --> 02:48:02.360]  these were brilliant combatants no Isis is not they've been trained in certain
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:07.440]  techniques shooting hostages at point blank creating explosives is not a great
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:12.560]  military feat however the fast foreign legion can penetrate them very quickly
[02:48:12.560 --> 02:48:17.400]  they speak Arabic they know their enemy exceedingly well and they will come in
[02:48:17.400 --> 02:48:21.160]  at the close quarters from a point of view the United States we're doing
[02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:25.640]  exactly what we should be doing flying out of Turkey and then insisting that
[02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:29.440]  Turkey bring in its ground forces because for the first time Turkish
[02:48:29.440 --> 02:48:34.000]  soldiers are Sunni soldiers and they know how to fight and the Turks were very
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:40.120]  effective for us and if in Korea and in Vietnam and they are when they want to
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:45.800]  be lethal killers and they are the most effective on the ground along with the
[02:48:45.800 --> 02:48:50.360]  French foreign legion and the Shiite fighters so you think you have decisions
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:55.720]  been made now to triple cross Isis otherwise yes but the most important
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:49:01.120]  decision in that is really just to kind of get into the front into the royal
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:08.200]  family of Saudi Arabia and insist that they step down or stop funding Isis the
[02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:13.240]  real money and the support comes from the office the exactly so what is the
[02:49:13.240 --> 02:49:17.760]  Saudi royal family thinking doing this well they're thinking that the Saudi
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:21.400]  royal families are very ineffectual family first of all they're not royal
[02:49:21.400 --> 02:49:25.640]  and they're not Saudi they're created by the British after the Ottoman Empire
[02:49:25.640 --> 02:49:31.160]  was dissolved they're basically better one tribes from Daria I've seen that
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:35.520]  they're not effective they have a 29-year-old minister royal a prince so
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:39.360]  called Prince who's in charge of the fighting and he started the fighting in
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:44.160]  Yemen we supplied them with guns and arms that has to stop and if that doesn't
[02:49:44.160 --> 02:49:48.400]  stop then I would encourage the young Saudis in their country to overthrow the
[02:49:48.400 --> 02:49:52.560]  government it's as simple as that they're out of control they've been a real
[02:49:52.560 --> 02:49:57.000]  pain in our neck for about 20 to 30 years they funded all of the Sunni
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:01.600]  extremists they were involved in 9-11 and it's time to take out that family
[02:50:01.600 --> 02:50:06.240]  from my point of view they're dispensable the same thing UAE same
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:10.160]  thing Qatar they have of no value whatsoever other than draining our own
[02:50:10.160 --> 02:50:14.560]  assets and protecting their own assets as a matter of fact Saudi Arabia has come
[02:50:14.560 --> 02:50:19.760]  into Arizona leased our land to extract water for their cattle and bring it back
[02:50:19.760 --> 02:50:25.800]  to Saudi Arabia so they're a deficit and a major problem for us in the war
[02:50:25.800 --> 02:50:29.320]  against the Sunnis well you're right in just six months ago they threatened
[02:50:29.320 --> 02:50:33.400]  Russia again on Syria saying they'd stage terror attacks the Russian didn't back
[02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:36.880]  off so it looks like that bluff didn't work someone asked dr. Steve Pachennick

[02:52:59.160 --> 02:53:03.680]  something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego the old
[02:53:03.680 --> 02:53:07.120]  guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks
[02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:11.480]  and head-to-head fitness tests how is this even possible turns out the old
[02:53:11.480 --> 02:53:14.600]  guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor
[02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:19.240]  formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens Patriot Power
[02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:22.720]  Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their
[02:53:22.720 --> 02:53:27.280]  achy joints stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past previously
[02:53:27.280 --> 02:53:31.360]  this drink was only available to elite military units but for a limited time
[02:53:31.360 --> 02:53:35.800]  the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples
[02:53:35.800 --> 02:53:39.960]  specifically for our conservative friends but you must act fast due to the
[02:53:39.960 --> 02:53:43.520]  high demand from members of the Coast Guard our supply is extremely limited
[02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:48.920]  right now to claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens go to green 75
[02:53:48.920 --> 02:53:56.320]  dot-com that's green 75 dot-com Greens 75 dot-com
[02:53:56.320 --> 02:53:59.600]  you
[02:54:15.720 --> 02:54:22.280]  Dr. Steve Pachennick is our guest for the second of the day but I take over and
[02:54:22.280 --> 02:54:26.920]  again he ran many famous anti-terrorism operations got glossages out many many
[02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:30.680]  times and crises much bigger than this one he was involved in Camp David Accord
[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:33.480]  so many other events I mean we couldn't have a better guest on to talk about
[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:37.600]  specifically what's happening I just see the president of France announcing
[02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:41.960]  suspending French liberties while they intend on bringing in record numbers of
[02:54:41.960 --> 02:54:46.960]  refugees that we know a lot of which are pilgrims into Syria out of other
[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:52.080]  countries wanting to basically get land basically Sunni's taking over Shiite
[02:54:52.080 --> 02:54:56.920]  areas in many cases to oversimplify it they've got fake passports what is the
[02:54:56.920 --> 02:55:02.040]  goal of the West Dr. Pachennick to bring in millions of Muslims from radical
[02:55:02.040 --> 02:55:06.800]  areas what do they expect to happen when there are undoubtedly terror attacks
[02:55:06.800 --> 02:55:11.160]  stemming from that well I'm not sure that we have any go where we are not a
[02:55:11.160 --> 02:55:15.960]  strategic country nor is France strategic what I've seen with the refugees
[02:55:15.960 --> 02:55:21.800]  you know I will hark back to Vladimir Putin Putin several months ago said
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:26.640]  something that was very revealing in a conversation which he said I don't
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:31.720]  understand how the Soviet Union was taken down I do not understand how 23
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:35.880]  million Russians found that they were alone and wandering about with no
[02:55:35.880 --> 02:55:40.120]  country now as your people know I was involved to take down the Soviet Union
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:45.560]  what I'm getting to now is that Putin is really paying back the West for what we
[02:55:45.560 --> 02:55:50.280]  did 20 years ago and taking down the Soviet Union this is Putin's way of
[02:55:50.280 --> 02:55:56.000]  allowing the refugees to get out of Syria go in through Greece and flood the
[02:55:56.000 --> 02:56:01.480]  Western European markets and the United States this is not unintentional Syria has
[02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:05.640]  very little to do with it the Union is totally ineffectual in our State
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:09.880]  Department is ineffectual so I would not allow any refugees at this point I
[02:56:09.880 --> 02:56:13.880]  don't care who they are Christians Muslims Buddhists because we don't have a
[02:56:13.880 --> 02:56:18.240]  vetting system but in fact we have to look back again to a little bit of
[02:56:18.240 --> 02:56:22.400]  history and understand why they're being flooded they're being flooded because
[02:56:22.400 --> 02:56:27.320]  this is Putin's revenge to the West for what we had done in the Soviet Union and
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:31.360]  he made it very clear although we never picked up that message in the same way
[02:56:31.360 --> 02:56:36.680]  that terrorism is an act of fear to instill fear for the injustices with
[02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:40.960]  that were done in the past you're not excusing it it's just a very cold
[02:56:40.960 --> 02:56:44.880]  calculating technique now many of you know I was involved with the Aldo
[02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:50.880]  Maro the Red Brigade we've taken down the PLO the PLA the PSLP I've been
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:56.080]  involved in a lot of this now it's time to see who can take down these groups do
[02:56:56.080 --> 02:57:01.440]  I have faith in my own government to do it not really but I do have faith in the
[02:57:01.440 --> 02:57:06.520]  French foreign legion to go in there and do what they need to do do I have faith
[02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:11.320]  in outsourcing mechanisms that we have at the covert level yes I do we will
[02:57:11.320 --> 02:57:16.440]  hire mercenaries and covert operatives to go in and do what they have to do but
[02:57:16.440 --> 02:57:21.240]  on the military side as the president said incorrectly if you have any questions
[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:25.320]  ask my chairman the Joint Chiefs of Staff well I heard from his chairman of the
[02:57:25.320 --> 02:57:30.000]  Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dunford who is a Marine four-star general and he
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:36.040]  said that our primary enemy today is Russia wrong general our primary enemy is
[02:57:36.040 --> 02:57:42.080]  ISIS al Qaeda and the extremists in the Islamic State not Russia Russia is our
[02:57:42.080 --> 02:57:47.280]  new ally has always been our effective ally when it comes to fighting external
[02:57:47.280 --> 02:57:51.640]  threats and particularly when it comes to terrorism because Putin understands
[02:57:51.640 --> 02:57:56.440]  what happens in Central Asia where you have millions and millions of ruthless
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:58:03.080]  extremists in the Caucasus, Azerbaijan and Turkistan and other places so Putin
[02:58:03.080 --> 02:58:08.600]  is well experienced he's gone in on our behalf to handle Syria our soldiers
[02:58:08.600 --> 02:58:14.120]  cannot handle this that sounds on a terrible point to point out but we are
[02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:20.160]  not effective we have not been effective in combat since 1944 is done as General
[02:58:20.160 --> 02:58:25.040]  Boykin said of the special forces we have not won a battle since the Battle of
[02:58:25.040 --> 02:58:29.080]  the Bulge in 44 and that's reality. Dr. Pachennick will talk to you again soon

[03:00:02.320 --> 03:00:07.800]  command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's
[03:00:07.800 --> 03:00:15.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network welcome to the fourth hour the Alex
[03:00:15.600 --> 03:00:20.120]  Jones radio show on this Tuesday November 17th 2015 I'm David Knight your
[03:00:20.120 --> 03:00:24.640]  host to Chikari Jackson be joining me in the next segment breaking down some of
[03:00:24.640 --> 03:00:29.200]  the breaking news and of course yesterday and I didn't realize as Tom saw this
[03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:34.040]  article of the new American yesterday was the 217th anniversary of something
[03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:37.760]  very important what would that be we might ask I'll give you a moment to think
[03:00:37.760 --> 03:00:42.920]  about it times up it's the 217th anniversary of signing of the Kentucky
[03:00:42.920 --> 03:00:46.760]  resolutions now that may sound like something that's very obscure a lot of
[03:00:46.760 --> 03:00:50.720]  our audience will know exactly what that is many of you listening may not know
[03:00:50.720 --> 03:00:54.520]  what that is we're going to break that down for you because yesterday we had
[03:00:54.520 --> 03:00:59.280]  something that really bears upon the issue of the Kentucky resolutions and
[03:00:59.280 --> 03:01:05.560]  that is where does power reside in our republic rightfully how is it divided
[03:01:05.560 --> 03:01:07.720]  between the states and the central government and where does it rightfully
[03:01:07.720 --> 03:01:14.240]  divide because yesterday we had a mass of governors began with six by the end
[03:01:14.240 --> 03:01:19.480]  of the day it was 21 today it was more than half of the governors have now said
[03:01:19.480 --> 03:01:25.160]  you know what we're not going to sign on to Obama's suicide pack of importing
[03:01:25.160 --> 03:01:30.240]  ISIS into the United States which is not going to do it it's absolute idiocy as
[03:01:30.240 --> 03:01:35.920]  Donald Trump said it's a Trojan horse absolutely a Trojan horse we can look
[03:01:35.920 --> 03:01:39.000]  at the figures that we saw and we talked about this last night on the nightly
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:44.600]  news ISIS is bragging that out of the five million migrants that have come
[03:01:44.600 --> 03:01:51.640]  into Europe that 4,000 of them are ISIS members ISIS jihadi terrorists does
[03:01:51.640 --> 03:01:55.320]  that sound too high I mean we're talking about five million people here and
[03:01:55.320 --> 03:01:59.840]  they're saying 4,000 of them would be that's not that high actually that is
[03:01:59.840 --> 03:02:05.080]  point zero eight percent less than one tenth of one percent of the people
[03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:10.840]  coming in in other words think about it this way if 99.92 percent of the people
[03:02:10.840 --> 03:02:14.800]  coming in were simply economic refugees they simply wanted to move to Europe
[03:02:14.800 --> 03:02:19.560]  because they want to make more money totally peaceful people that remaining
[03:02:19.560 --> 03:02:25.400]  zero point zero eight percent would work out to 4,000 terrorists and we saw
[03:02:25.400 --> 03:02:30.440]  what a half dozen of them did to Paris okay but Obama says no no no we don't we
[03:02:30.440 --> 03:02:35.000]  we are better than that we we have to do this in the name of compassion so we're
[03:02:35.000 --> 03:02:38.760]  going to talk about what Obama is promising to do he's talking about you
[03:02:38.760 --> 03:02:42.400]  know we see this figure of 10,000 being pushed around by the mainstream media
[03:02:42.400 --> 03:02:48.440]  John Kerry made that very clear 10,000 is not the ceiling it's the floor it's the
[03:02:48.440 --> 03:02:53.160]  floor they're looking to pull in a hundred thousand this year and a hundred
[03:02:53.160 --> 03:02:56.840]  thousand next year that's their goal they don't have a ceiling you understand
[03:02:56.840 --> 03:03:02.560]  they have a floor in terms of the number of ISIS that they're going to bring in
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:07.320]  and of course that's precisely what's going on we all know everyone who
[03:03:07.320 --> 03:03:11.320]  listens to this show anyone who is awake understands and we had this
[03:03:11.320 --> 03:03:15.480]  discussion a couple years ago back in 2013 when they were trying to build a
[03:03:15.480 --> 03:03:20.000]  pressure for a movement a mass movement into Syria creating a no-fly zone at
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:23.160]  that time people said no we're not going to be Al Qaeda's Air Force because they
[03:03:23.160 --> 03:03:27.080]  understood what was going on there so they renamed it moved it along and of
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:32.080]  course the basis of that was a false report about seren gas saying well that
[03:03:32.080 --> 03:03:37.280]  could only have come from the Assad government that wasn't true there was
[03:03:37.280 --> 03:03:40.440]  experience about that in the past and we made that very clear also going to talk
[03:03:40.440 --> 03:03:44.240]  briefly a little bit about the Democrat debate I mentioned this on the
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:47.280]  nightly news last night and there was one exchange in particular there were
[03:03:47.280 --> 03:03:51.040]  several of them that were very interesting one of them in particular
[03:03:51.040 --> 03:03:56.640]  was Bernie sander nista was pointedly asked how how are you going to pay for
[03:03:56.640 --> 03:04:00.000]  all this what kind of income tax rate are you looking at and it goes well I
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:05.720]  wouldn't make it 90% time I'm not as much of a socialist as Eisenhower well
[03:04:05.720 --> 03:04:08.880]  we're going to talk about that what were the rates under Eisenhower what were the
[03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:12.320]  rates under Nixon because then governor O'Malley brought in Richard Nixon so
[03:04:12.320 --> 03:04:16.320]  well Richard Nixon had 70% interest rates now that's where he started we're
[03:04:16.320 --> 03:04:19.680]  going to talk about the truth of all this and we're going to talk about the
[03:04:19.680 --> 03:04:24.800]  real socialist this there FDR what did he do to the income tax rates but more
[03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:28.920]  importantly what did he do to the working poor what did he do to the median
[03:04:28.920 --> 03:04:32.640]  family income we're also going to talk about Janet Yellen she's pushing back
[03:04:32.640 --> 03:04:36.800]  very hard against the form act that is being sponsored by Rand Paul and others
[03:04:36.800 --> 03:04:40.480]  in the Congress to try to get some accountability and some control over the
[03:04:40.480 --> 03:04:43.720]  Federal Reserve and Janet Yellen won't have any of it stay with us we're going to
[03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:46.760]  be right back with jacquard jacks
[03:04:57.400 --> 03:05:01.800]  black lives matter activists another radical leftist are using the hashtag
[03:05:01.800 --> 03:05:06.360]  F paris to voice their anger over the fact that the ISIS attacks have shifted
[03:05:06.360 --> 03:05:09.320]  the public's attention away from the University of Missouri protests the
[03:05:09.320 --> 03:05:13.320]  disgusting hashtag started turning on Twitter Sunday as Soros backed activists
[03:05:13.320 --> 03:05:16.280]  grew outraged over the fact that the public is more concerned about the
[03:05:16.280 --> 03:05:19.680]  hundred and twenty nine people killed in Paris than they are about safe spaces
[03:05:19.680 --> 03:05:24.320]  one self-described internationally known activists tweeted quote ain't seen one
[03:05:24.320 --> 03:05:28.800]  dead body on the Paris attacks prayer for Paris my butt F Paris black lives
[03:05:28.800 --> 03:05:32.880]  matter basically speaking the F Paris crowd is claiming that more people are
[03:05:32.880 --> 03:05:36.640]  paying attention to the Paris terrorist attacks in the Mizzou protest because the
[03:05:36.640 --> 03:05:41.280]  Paris massacre is a so-called white tragedy as if we should judge tragedies
[03:05:41.280 --> 03:05:44.920]  by the victim's skin color a notion that's inherently racist but it is
[03:05:44.920 --> 03:05:48.320]  interesting to note however that the same global elites who have radicalized
[03:05:48.320 --> 03:05:51.920]  the black lives matter movement are also the same ones who created conditions

[03:08:09.800 --> 03:08:13.080]  back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight for the fourth hour we have
[03:08:13.080 --> 03:08:17.120]  Jakari Jackson joining us to break down some of the breaking news and later in
[03:08:17.120 --> 03:08:22.120]  the broadcast I'm going to talk about the emerging conflict between US
[03:08:22.120 --> 03:08:26.520]  governors and Barack Obama who insists that he's going to bring in Syrian
[03:08:26.520 --> 03:08:32.680]  quote-unquote refugees regardless of what the American governors say they're
[03:08:32.680 --> 03:08:37.440]  going to do and we look at the 217th anniversary of the Kentucky
[03:08:37.440 --> 03:08:45.760]  resolutions a famous piece of history that enforces states sovereignty and that
[03:08:45.760 --> 03:08:48.640]  happened yesterday so we're going to talk about that in the context of what's
[03:08:48.640 --> 03:08:52.840]  going on with Obama's immigration plans his open border plans because we know
[03:08:52.840 --> 03:08:56.440]  what's going on with us we know that what's happening here in America what
[03:08:56.440 --> 03:09:02.040]  is happening in Europe is essentially a plan to take down our civilization take
[03:09:02.040 --> 03:09:05.640]  down our nations they say they don't want to have any national borders anymore
[03:09:05.640 --> 03:09:09.960]  of course they don't they want to level everything so they can impose the new
[03:09:09.960 --> 03:09:13.040]  world order and they're coming at that from two different directions they have
[03:09:13.040 --> 03:09:17.960]  one way to sell the new world government to conservatives and say this is about
[03:09:17.960 --> 03:09:21.440]  free trade and economics that would be the trans-pacific transatlantic
[03:09:21.440 --> 03:09:25.360]  partnerships for the Liberals again in Paris in just two weeks they're coming
[03:09:25.360 --> 03:09:29.840]  up with a climate change summit and so they're going to sell world governance
[03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:33.960]  based on saving the environment and they'll probably get both of these
[03:09:33.960 --> 03:09:36.720]  through but either one of them Jakari would be world government and it would
[03:09:36.720 --> 03:09:40.760]  be a disaster for us. Yeah you're talking about how Obama was to bring so many
[03:09:40.760 --> 03:09:45.040]  people into the nation you know 10,000 I believe was a lowball estimate his top
[03:09:45.040 --> 03:09:49.280]  advisor saying Ms. President we cannot background check that large amount of
[03:09:49.280 --> 03:09:55.080]  people and the two months left we have in the year. They don't care about any of that
[03:09:55.080 --> 03:09:57.920]  but the thing I think is very interesting that a lot of people aren't
[03:09:57.920 --> 03:10:01.280]  really talking about David when we talk about the people that are coming here
[03:10:01.280 --> 03:10:04.880]  from the countries not just Syria from Pakistan from Yemen's from any place
[03:10:04.880 --> 03:10:08.160]  else of course somebody in Pakistan or Yemen wants to come here they have
[03:10:08.160 --> 03:10:12.600]  drone strikes destroying the country you know they had live in a world where
[03:10:12.600 --> 03:10:15.240]  they could go to a wedding and get blown up they live in a world they could go to
[03:10:15.240 --> 03:10:19.520]  the hospital have a hospital destroyed by a US strike so of course they want to
[03:10:19.520 --> 03:10:22.720]  come here but nobody wants to talk about its US policies that are driving
[03:10:22.720 --> 03:10:26.240]  many people here in the first place. Yes we create the problem in their country
[03:10:26.240 --> 03:10:29.200]  and then the solution is to bring them in here and then they want to create a
[03:10:29.200 --> 03:10:33.080]  problem in our country and then the solution is to bring in world governance.
[03:10:33.080 --> 03:10:36.360]  And it's a double tap on the hands of the government because they use your
[03:10:36.360 --> 03:10:38.960]  tax dollars to go tear up these countries yes and then they bring them
[03:10:38.960 --> 03:10:42.000]  here and they say well you guys need to put the bill you need to do your part
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:46.160]  well Obama Washington why don't you do your part and stop destroying these
[03:10:46.160 --> 03:10:49.680]  countries. Well they have to destroy the first world nations because the first
[03:10:49.680 --> 03:10:52.760]  world nations are the only ones who are going to stand up to their world
[03:10:52.760 --> 03:10:57.000]  governance. There's there are people who have the the money and the financial
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:00.040]  ability and the time to take a look at politics and that is diminishing you
[03:11:00.040 --> 03:11:03.880]  know as you get to the point where you're struggling to make ends meet
[03:11:03.880 --> 03:11:07.600]  financially you have less and less time to pay attention or to do anything when
[03:11:07.600 --> 03:11:11.280]  these guys are stealing everything from you so they have to take down the first
[03:11:11.280 --> 03:11:14.160]  world economies they have to take down the first world nations they have to
[03:11:14.160 --> 03:11:17.400]  level everything so they can build what they want coming up next and they've
[03:11:17.400 --> 03:11:20.760]  already shown us what that is they've already shown us the mechanisms where
[03:11:20.760 --> 03:11:25.640]  they will be able to operate above us and independent of any of the countries
[03:11:25.640 --> 03:11:29.360]  that create this. Oh absolutely they don't want any accountability but on this
[03:11:29.360 --> 03:11:32.520]  same notion of accountability we'll talk about some domestic account on
[03:11:32.520 --> 03:11:36.520]  accountability. We have this article police civil asset forfeitures exceed
[03:11:36.520 --> 03:11:41.720]  all burglaries in 2014 which basically means the cops are taking more than the
[03:11:41.720 --> 03:11:45.720]  crooks. Well you're several times more likely to be shot by the police than by
[03:11:45.720 --> 03:11:51.200]  terrorists too. Oh yeah. I don't know what the exact figure is but it was something like that. They had the article came out I believe it was this year you're more
[03:11:51.200 --> 03:11:55.480]  police have killed more people now than they killed in Iraq or something along
[03:11:55.480 --> 03:11:59.680]  those lines. So we're much more concerned about the shoot first rules of the police
[03:11:59.680 --> 03:12:03.280]  have. I've got an article right here five people shot by local police and North
[03:12:03.280 --> 03:12:07.040]  Miami-Dade oh and 48 hours over the weekend. So this is the way that the
[03:12:07.040 --> 03:12:10.400]  police are now their standard operating procedure about how they interact with the
[03:12:10.400 --> 03:12:14.000]  public. So we're really at far greater danger from our own police than we are
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:18.920]  from terrorists. Absolutely because we have a very large police force they're
[03:12:18.920 --> 03:12:23.440]  moderately trained to be the polite about it. You know we think about
[03:12:23.440 --> 03:12:26.800]  situations like you're not just the famous cases we have but you know some
[03:12:26.800 --> 03:12:29.880]  of the more low-key cases of the Empire State Building is one of my favorite
[03:12:29.880 --> 03:12:34.720]  examples. The officers they respond to are active situation they open fire hit
[03:12:34.720 --> 03:12:37.480]  nine other people who are not their intended targets. You know who gets
[03:12:37.480 --> 03:12:41.960]  blamed for that you know it's a oops you know something something that simple. So
[03:12:41.960 --> 03:12:46.120]  yeah if you look at the American police forces they would be the fourth largest
[03:12:46.120 --> 03:12:48.800]  army in the world if they were standing army and they're doing everything they
[03:12:48.800 --> 03:12:52.600]  can to turn them into an army but you're pointing out now they're also the
[03:12:52.600 --> 03:12:55.440]  ones who are stealing the most merchandise. Oh yeah and they have they have the
[03:12:55.440 --> 03:12:59.520]  article breakdown. This is from Armstrong, Armstrong Economics and it says
[03:12:59.520 --> 03:13:05.560]  between 1989 and 2010 he was attorney seized and estimated 12.6 billion in
[03:13:05.560 --> 03:13:10.760]  asset forfeitures. Now you go to 2014 and that number ballooned to roughly 4.5
[03:13:10.760 --> 03:13:15.200]  million for just that year which means according to the FBI the total amount of
[03:13:15.200 --> 03:13:19.960]  good stolen by criminals in 2014 offenses suffered an estimated 3.9
[03:13:19.960 --> 03:13:24.660]  billion in property losses which is to say that you are more likely to be rob
[03:13:24.660 --> 03:13:29.400]  by the police than you are to be. It truly is robbery they call it civil
[03:13:29.400 --> 03:13:32.880]  asset forfeiture and everything about that is a lie. They're saying you're
[03:13:32.880 --> 03:13:36.680]  going to forfeit your your assets they take this property from people yes
[03:13:36.680 --> 03:13:40.120]  alleging that the property could have been involved in some way with a crime
[03:13:40.120 --> 03:13:44.160]  independent of the owner okay and they don't ever charge you with a crime they
[03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:47.680]  never find you guilty of a crime they just seize your property because they
[03:13:47.680 --> 03:13:52.040]  call it civil that means that you have no due process if it was criminal
[03:13:52.040 --> 03:13:55.480]  seizure if they'd actually charged you with a crime and they took your property
[03:13:55.480 --> 03:13:59.000]  no no no they would then have to go through and invent some new law or
[03:13:59.000 --> 03:14:02.280]  something to overturn the Constitution say no we're not going to give you due
[03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:05.360]  process we're not going to wait till we find you guilty but they call it civil
[03:14:05.360 --> 03:14:09.600]  instead of criminal so then they can just according to them steal anything that
[03:14:09.600 --> 03:14:13.280]  they want from yes that's the way these crooks operate that's the crookedness
[03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:17.800]  of the federal government how these people have really turned into a crime
[03:14:17.800 --> 03:14:22.040]  organized crime is nothing it's just organized crime and these guys are
[03:14:22.040 --> 03:14:27.080]  shooting people on the streets like the mafia yeah and on those same lines we
[03:14:27.080 --> 03:14:30.720]  have a Hollywood star this is Dan Bezierian he's a you know I guess a
[03:14:30.720 --> 03:14:35.840]  professional gambler all all this stuff is on Drudge and basically he had a
[03:14:35.840 --> 03:14:38.720]  situation at his home he wasn't home at the time but somebody broke into his
[03:14:38.720 --> 03:14:42.760]  house tried to break into his gun vault were unsuccessful in their efforts the
[03:14:42.760 --> 03:14:46.160]  police show up break open the gun vault and steal his guns yeah and he was like
[03:14:46.160 --> 03:14:50.440]  the police stole it nobody even so how is this evidence nobody actually
[03:14:50.440 --> 03:14:53.560]  physically touched the guns except the police they eventually returned the
[03:14:53.560 --> 03:14:58.080]  the firearms but they kept the magazines and the ammunition yeah so not all of it
[03:14:58.080 --> 03:15:01.880]  yeah and that's what he does as part of his that he's like an internet star is
[03:15:01.880 --> 03:15:05.720]  yeah he's got some stuff yeah he's a model he shoots guns and things like
[03:15:05.720 --> 03:15:09.680]  that yeah so that's you know part of his livelihood yeah you know and now they've
[03:15:09.680 --> 03:15:14.840]  they've taken it they have as far as I know no immediate plans to return it but
[03:15:14.840 --> 03:15:18.320]  why they took it in the first place is so far beyond me what logic they used to
[03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:22.880]  see something for evidence that was never actually touched in a crime just
[03:15:22.880 --> 03:15:27.080]  underscores the danger when we throw away the rule of law people don't realize
[03:15:27.080 --> 03:15:32.000]  what we have passively set aside and let these people get away with they will
[03:15:32.000 --> 03:15:36.360]  assume power if you don't stop them or call them on it and that's what we're
[03:15:36.360 --> 03:15:41.440]  seeing here we no longer have police who really feel like they're under any kind
[03:15:41.440 --> 03:15:44.160]  of checks or balances they don't really have to obey the law they can do
[03:15:44.160 --> 03:15:47.440]  whatever they want to they can steal your property they can shoot you have got
[03:15:47.440 --> 03:15:50.480]  an article here about a North Carolina dad who is fatally shot they went to his
[03:15:50.480 --> 03:15:53.640]  house looking for somebody that no longer lived there and he said get a
[03:15:53.640 --> 03:15:57.840]  warrant shut the door they break in taser windup killing the guy for no
[03:15:57.840 --> 03:16:01.080]  reason at all for no reason all they instigate something and then they say
[03:16:01.080 --> 03:16:05.280]  I feared for my life so I shot him you know I used excessive force because you
[03:16:05.280 --> 03:16:10.600]  know what if you or I were to initiate a conflict with somebody if you or I were
[03:16:10.600 --> 03:16:15.920]  to shoot somebody when we're not really in any danger okay shoot people who are
[03:16:15.920 --> 03:16:19.600]  running away shoot people who are a far distance from us that are unarmed we
[03:16:19.600 --> 03:16:23.080]  would be rightfully tried for murder and these cops are never tried for murder
[03:16:23.080 --> 03:16:27.520]  well because it's the what you call it the thin blue line nobody if it's an
[03:16:27.520 --> 03:16:32.040]  officer or somebody wearing a badge or a suit then they assume that it's on the
[03:16:32.040 --> 03:16:35.320]  up and up but that's not always the case the government has made it clear to them
[03:16:35.320 --> 03:16:39.280]  that they're going to stand behind them they want them they want them to be
[03:16:39.280 --> 03:16:42.960]  aggressive with the public that's the whole point and I think relations with
[03:16:42.960 --> 03:16:46.320]  police would be a whole lot better you know if we had more officers come out
[03:16:46.320 --> 03:16:50.120]  and to cry the actions that were seen around the country you know various
[03:16:50.120 --> 03:16:53.280]  actions and you know of course I don't blame all actions for everything a
[03:16:53.280 --> 03:16:56.880]  police officer does but you know I've seen the memes like I'll believe that
[03:16:56.880 --> 03:17:00.440]  they're a good police when good police start arresting bad police when they put
[03:17:00.440 --> 03:17:04.120]  these guys in jail when they don't just do a slap on the wrist or if you retire
[03:17:04.120 --> 03:17:07.720]  early we won't pursue any charges against you when they actually come down
[03:17:07.720 --> 03:17:10.440]  when these guys already hold them accountable the action that they're
[03:17:10.440 --> 03:17:14.000]  doing then I think things will take a very positive turn in this country
[03:17:14.000 --> 03:17:17.560]  exactly it's what Frank Cerberco said he said you're gonna always have bad
[03:17:17.560 --> 03:17:21.880]  people in any system and they're bad cops and they're good cops the question
[03:17:21.880 --> 03:17:26.600]  is what does the system do does the system purge the bad people out or does
[03:17:26.600 --> 03:17:30.360]  it embrace them and embrace the corruption if it does things go downhill
[03:17:30.360 --> 03:17:33.800]  very quickly that's what we're seeing now the system will not come against the
[03:17:33.800 --> 03:17:37.640]  bad cops in most cases they will embrace them and that's precisely the opposite
[03:17:37.640 --> 03:17:39.880]  of what we need to be doing. What else have you got there, Jigari?
[03:17:39.880 --> 03:17:43.800]  I've been talking about a little bit of TSA I know you've had your advantage with the TSA
[03:17:43.800 --> 03:17:47.600]  I think we've all missed building that some adventures with the TSA and now the
[03:17:47.600 --> 03:17:52.520]  TSA is failing to detect loaded guns to their airport scanners you know the last
[03:17:52.520 --> 03:17:56.560]  time I went through the TSA you know week travel David we take
[03:17:56.560 --> 03:18:00.680]  camera equipment microphones cables all these things they routinely take stuff
[03:18:00.680 --> 03:18:04.080]  out of my bag I was with Michael on our last trip they you know pat him down
[03:18:04.080 --> 03:18:06.840]  they're digging through my bag of course there's nothing in there except some
[03:18:06.840 --> 03:18:11.160]  toothpaste as they said was too large they took my toothpaste Tom's floor I
[03:18:11.160 --> 03:18:17.120]  free toothpaste and but now that we see that the TSA can't even stop a gun from
[03:18:17.120 --> 03:18:20.480]  going through the scanners. Was this the case where the guy was
[03:18:20.480 --> 03:18:23.440]  traveling on the plane and when he reached his destination he realized oh
[03:18:23.440 --> 03:18:26.880]  I've got this gun on me. Yeah that's pretty much what it was he was a trucker you
[03:18:26.880 --> 03:18:29.800]  know he didn't do it as a stunner anything like he just legitimately forgot
[03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:34.920]  he had it in his bag and he wound up getting off the plane you know had this
[03:18:34.920 --> 03:18:39.600]  firearm wound all the time. See that's not surprising because they had inspectors
[03:18:39.600 --> 03:18:42.880]  that would set up false scenarios where they would deliberately try to smuggle
[03:18:42.880 --> 03:18:46.320]  this through and we reported on this about two months ago and they had a
[03:18:46.320 --> 03:18:52.640]  0% detection of all these different cases where they they took a government
[03:18:52.640 --> 03:18:56.720]  agent put a firearm on him ran him through the TSA security and every one
[03:18:56.720 --> 03:19:02.040]  of the cases they were able to get through. And Jakari they know that they
[03:19:02.040 --> 03:19:07.080]  know going back to 2011 we had the engineer Corbett who showed that he
[03:19:07.080 --> 03:19:10.360]  could smuggle a weapon through that there was a blind spot and the naked body
[03:19:10.360 --> 03:19:16.480]  skinners and he wrote articles about that and he subsequently sued the TSA for
[03:19:16.480 --> 03:19:19.240]  violation of his Fourth Amendment rights because they are violating everybody's
[03:19:19.240 --> 03:19:22.020]  Fourth Amendment rights as part of the discovery of that lawsuit and we reported
[03:19:22.020 --> 03:19:27.040]  on that here at Info Wars he had asked for some documents and they posted when
[03:19:27.040 --> 03:19:31.360]  they put it up on Pacer.gov which is where they list the lawsuits they put
[03:19:31.360 --> 03:19:35.960]  up the unredacted copy first and you could see that the TSA said that in 2011
[03:19:35.960 --> 03:19:40.320]  there were no threats to airports or airplanes and yet that same year they
[03:19:40.320 --> 03:19:43.160]  were going to shut down Texas as a no-fly zone because there was a bill to
[03:19:43.160 --> 03:19:46.040]  stop the sexual molestation the violation of Fourth Amendment.
[03:19:46.040 --> 03:19:49.200]  I can't remember that. Thank you so much Jakari Jackson stay with us when we come back we're
[03:19:49.200 --> 03:19:53.760]  gonna talk about what's going on with Obama's importation of ISIS terrorists
[03:19:53.760 --> 03:19:58.640]  and the pushback that may come to a head between state governors and Obama
[03:19:58.640 --> 03:20:05.000]  we'll be right back. Earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or
[03:20:05.000 --> 03:20:09.000]  war each of us have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better
[03:20:09.000 --> 03:20:13.000]  prepared we typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we
[03:20:13.000 --> 03:20:17.360]  address the need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about
[03:20:17.360 --> 03:20:21.600]  staying warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I
[03:20:21.600 --> 03:20:25.640]  keep my family warm the standard answers are firewood, coal or propane but the
[03:20:25.640 --> 03:20:29.520]  problem with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you
[03:20:29.520 --> 03:20:33.880]  another concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke
[03:20:33.880 --> 03:20:38.080]  like in times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the
[03:20:38.080 --> 03:20:43.040]  answers may be simpler and less costly than you think for these answers go to

[03:24:13.840 --> 03:24:18.600]  want to talk about what's going on with efforts to try to reign in the Federal
[03:24:18.600 --> 03:24:23.600]  Reserve also want to mention one or two episodes from the Democrat debate that I
[03:24:23.600 --> 03:24:28.120]  find very instructive because you know we understand we're not we're not naive
[03:24:28.120 --> 03:24:31.720]  we understand what the elections are when we understand that elections as bad
[03:24:31.720 --> 03:24:35.760]  as they are the presidential elections are the worst case scenario it's there
[03:24:35.760 --> 03:24:41.440]  that they try to detract you from any local efforts any local involvement that
[03:24:41.440 --> 03:24:46.880]  could really make a difference in a real grassroots movement they want you to
[03:24:46.880 --> 03:24:52.640]  get focused on the most centralized most bought-out race there is in the
[03:24:52.640 --> 03:24:54.920]  country that's a presidential race thinking that you're going to make a
[03:24:54.920 --> 03:24:59.800]  difference but it's still important to look at the way these people manipulate
[03:24:59.800 --> 03:25:04.280]  and understand that this is going to be we're looking at the manipulator the
[03:25:04.280 --> 03:25:08.400]  propagandist and chief okay we're going to be selecting the president and
[03:25:08.400 --> 03:25:12.560]  there's no better evidence of that than what happened in the Democrat debate and
[03:25:12.560 --> 03:25:15.440]  as a point out we're also going to be taking a look at the efforts to try to
[03:25:15.440 --> 03:25:19.200]  control the Federal Reserve before we do I just want to let you know about the

[03:26:35.040 --> 03:26:38.200]  these last night on there on the nightly news several things that came up with
[03:26:38.200 --> 03:26:44.880]  the Democrat debate they tried very hard to get them to say radical Islam radical
[03:26:44.880 --> 03:26:49.800]  say it with me radical Islam they absolutely absolutely refused Hillary
[03:26:49.800 --> 03:26:54.800]  tried to spin it and say well I don't think you know we're not against all
[03:26:54.800 --> 03:27:01.600]  all Islamists all Muslims actually she said Muslims I think okay we're not
[03:27:01.600 --> 03:27:05.760]  against all Muslims and he said well he was quoting Marco Rubio and he said well
[03:27:05.760 --> 03:27:09.600]  he wasn't talking about all Muslims he was talking about radical Islamists are
[03:27:09.600 --> 03:27:13.280]  you afraid to say that yes I don't think that would be very helpful all three of
[03:27:13.280 --> 03:27:19.200]  them were unable to use to utter those those syllables and understand one of
[03:27:19.200 --> 03:27:23.040]  the reasons why that is okay we see this with the Southern Poverty Law Center go
[03:27:23.040 --> 03:27:27.160]  just as an exercise go to Southern Poverty Law Center and do a search on
[03:27:27.160 --> 03:27:31.400]  their website whenever you see radical Islam you will not see them talking about
[03:27:31.400 --> 03:27:36.040]  real radical Islam you'll see them talking about people who talk about radical
[03:27:36.040 --> 03:27:40.240]  Islam see radical Islam is not the problem people who talk about radical
[03:27:40.240 --> 03:27:45.080]  Islam or the problem they're portrayed as racists they're portrayed as
[03:27:45.080 --> 03:27:49.000]  xenophobes they're portrayed as anti-immigrant and the same thing is true
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:55.200]  of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue ISD the think tank in Europe that is
[03:27:55.200 --> 03:28:01.880]  behind the New Strong Cities Network both ISD in Europe and SPLC in the United
[03:28:01.880 --> 03:28:05.600]  States who set up the talking points that we're being propagandized with it
[03:28:05.600 --> 03:28:11.120]  anyone who is concerned at all about the as ISIS put it the 4,000 plus terrorists
[03:28:11.120 --> 03:28:14.440]  that have come in through the open borders and I talked about how that's
[03:28:14.440 --> 03:28:20.320]  very plausible that's only point zero eight percent it's eight tenths of one
[03:28:20.320 --> 03:28:23.520]  percent of the people that they've let in it's only eight tenths of one percent
[03:28:23.520 --> 03:28:29.160]  are jihadi terrorists and you get 4,000 people so they couldn't talk about that
[03:28:29.160 --> 03:28:34.400]  Hillary told some amazing amazing whoppers I mean these are these are
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:38.680]  things kind of like the story of Pecos Bill you know we got thirsty so he dug
[03:28:38.680 --> 03:28:42.160]  the Rio Grande you know he shot out all the stars but one that's the how we got
[03:28:42.160 --> 03:28:47.560]  the Lone Star State this is the kind of stuff that Hillary was spinning at the
[03:28:47.560 --> 03:28:51.360]  Democrat debate she said since their last debate in Las Vegas there have been
[03:28:51.360 --> 03:28:57.080]  3,000 people killed with guns 200 children nothing of the sort those
[03:28:57.080 --> 03:29:01.760]  numbers are totally made up totally exaggerated she said there's been 21
[03:29:01.760 --> 03:29:07.320]  mass shootings since their last debate no there's been one there's been one she
[03:29:07.320 --> 03:29:10.960]  mentioned that one by name and she said in three people died in that one no one
[03:29:10.960 --> 03:29:15.440]  person died in that one everything she said about guns was a made-up lie she
[03:29:15.440 --> 03:29:21.240]  harangued Bernie Sanders because he voted against a bill that would not let
[03:29:21.240 --> 03:29:25.920]  people sue someone if they didn't do any negligence and products that they made
[03:29:25.920 --> 03:29:28.960]  how about that she's a lawyer she knows better than that of course she knows that
[03:29:28.960 --> 03:29:32.920]  she can get away with lying she can get away with murder when we come back we're
[03:29:32.920 --> 03:29:38.440]  going to talk about Bernie Sanders Easter's big lie and the programs that he
[03:29:38.440 --> 03:29:43.000]  wants to enact that he has no idea he admits he has no idea how much these
[03:29:43.000 --> 03:29:45.800]  programs are going to cost they was we'll be right back and we'll talk about
[03:29:45.800 --> 03:29:52.320]  Janet Yellen and the Fed we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[03:29:52.320 --> 03:29:56.400]  and the GCN radio network
[03:29:57.840 --> 03:30:02.040]  in early October of this year Matt Drudge paid a visit to the Central Texas
[03:30:02.040 --> 03:30:05.520]  Command Center and made the following chilling statements concerning free
[03:30:05.520 --> 03:30:09.680]  speech and his own site the drudge report I had a Supreme Court justice tell
[03:30:09.680 --> 03:30:13.880]  me to my face it's over for me to Matt it's over for you they've got the votes
[03:30:13.880 --> 03:30:17.360]  now to enforce copyright law you're out of there well now we have the words of
[03:30:17.360 --> 03:30:22.280]  FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai he said it is conceivable to me to see the government
[03:30:22.280 --> 03:30:25.760]  saying we think the drudge report is having a disproportionate effect on our
[03:30:25.760 --> 03:30:30.200]  political discourse Pai told the right online conference back in May of 2015 the
[03:30:30.200 --> 03:30:33.800]  FCC doesn't have the ability to regulate anything he says and we want to start
[03:30:33.800 --> 03:30:37.520]  tamping down on websites like that there are a lot of people who just don't like
[03:30:37.520 --> 03:30:40.760]  the fact that the internet is a completely unregulated marketplace in
[03:30:40.760 --> 03:30:44.520]  terms of freedom of speech Pai told the website inside sources and there are some
[03:30:44.520 --> 03:30:47.600]  speech that people just don't like or they think that it should be regulated
[03:30:47.600 --> 03:30:51.240]  because it has an outsized effect on public discourse and drudge report is
[03:30:51.240 --> 03:30:55.840]  one of those time is limited rob do reporting for info wars com and info

[03:33:10.280 --> 03:33:14.520]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david knight your host there's an article
[03:33:14.520 --> 03:33:18.080]  before we get to the Fed and sort of the serious economic articles there's an
[03:33:18.080 --> 03:33:21.840]  article that almost looks like it's coming out of the onion the satire
[03:33:21.840 --> 03:33:27.320]  magazine german robot practices hitting humans to ensure their future safety
[03:33:27.320 --> 03:33:35.200]  and this is so indicative of the kind of sadomasochism that we have with our
[03:33:35.200 --> 03:33:39.840]  government and also with the way they're mechanizing these robots to take
[03:33:39.840 --> 03:33:44.120]  everything away from us this is a german scientist named roland barons he
[03:33:44.120 --> 03:33:49.120]  wants to teach robots how not to kill humans he says it first though he needs
[03:33:49.120 --> 03:33:53.720]  to know how hard they can hit before causing any serious damage so they've
[03:33:53.720 --> 03:33:57.680]  got actually got idiots who have signed up for this
[03:33:57.680 --> 03:34:03.800]  go ahead hit me give it with your best with your best robot shot okay they say
[03:34:03.800 --> 03:34:06.720]  they need to be able to coexist with humans without hurting them because
[03:34:06.720 --> 03:34:11.720]  evidently part of coexistence with us is going to be hitting us hitting us
[03:34:11.720 --> 03:34:15.680]  yeah just make sure that you don't hit them too hard look we understand how
[03:34:15.680 --> 03:34:18.560]  robots are going to be used by DARPA how they're going to be used by the police
[03:34:18.560 --> 03:34:22.080]  how they're going to be used by the governments to control us okay that's
[03:34:22.080 --> 03:34:26.920]  what this is about let's understand this let's let's get a get a clue here this
[03:34:26.920 --> 03:34:30.560]  is coming from in gadget they say they hit a group of volunteers on the arm of
[03:34:30.560 --> 03:34:34.520]  the shoulder so they can set the impact at the highest mass and the lowest
[03:34:34.520 --> 03:34:40.640]  velocity and the team stops testing when the pain reaches level five in a
[03:34:40.640 --> 03:34:44.800]  scale of one to ten and the subjects are then put through ultrasound to check
[03:34:44.800 --> 03:34:49.440]  for bruises from the impact they say collaborative robots on the rise yes yes
[03:34:49.440 --> 03:34:54.200]  they're here to help you they're here to help you all those robots that they've
[03:34:54.200 --> 03:34:58.560]  got that they're teaching to run and climb and run faster than humans and
[03:34:58.560 --> 03:35:03.360]  all those are there to help you you know in case we have some kind of a
[03:35:03.360 --> 03:35:07.320]  nuclear meltdown and a reactor or something they need a robot they can
[03:35:07.320 --> 03:35:13.080]  run faster than a human to run through the you know the nuclear reactor and
[03:35:13.080 --> 03:35:16.920]  shut down the control rods or whatever now look you and I know what they're
[03:35:16.920 --> 03:35:20.160]  doing they're creating terminator machines they're creating autonomous
[03:35:20.160 --> 03:35:23.880]  killer robots they're creating swarms of drones they've admitted it we've talked
[03:35:23.880 --> 03:35:28.120]  about the documents we've we've they've they've published some of the documents
[03:35:28.120 --> 03:35:31.680]  some of them have leaked out we've talked about that we know precisely where
[03:35:31.680 --> 03:35:35.560]  they're going with this but yet you've got the technological press that plays
[03:35:35.560 --> 03:35:39.840]  along with this imaginary scenario yes they're here and they're from the
[03:35:39.840 --> 03:35:43.640]  government and they're here to help you but first I have to learn how hard they
[03:35:43.640 --> 03:35:48.840]  can hit you without killing you okay I mean I go back and I look at it's
[03:35:48.840 --> 03:35:52.640]  almost like the economics switch over to economic news is almost like like the
[03:35:52.640 --> 03:35:57.480]  Laffer curve remember Ronald Reagan I had the economist author Laffer and he
[03:35:57.480 --> 03:36:01.880]  came up with a bell shaped curve and he said well you know as we increase tax
[03:36:01.880 --> 03:36:07.480]  revenue as we increase increase the tax rate the tax revenue goes up and then it
[03:36:07.480 --> 03:36:11.720]  peaks and starts to drop off again and so we want to get it right there at the
[03:36:11.720 --> 03:36:16.680]  top of the curve where it's maximized and it's like well why don't we why is it
[03:36:16.680 --> 03:36:21.440]  that our objective even under Ronald Reagan was to see how hard the government
[03:36:21.440 --> 03:36:26.240]  could hit us economically without killing us okay that's essentially what the
[03:36:26.240 --> 03:36:30.280]  Laffer curve was about I mean it was genuine it was for real but that was
[03:36:30.280 --> 03:36:34.960]  essentially what that was about now that that brings up what was going on I
[03:36:34.960 --> 03:36:38.760]  think I think one of the more interesting exchanges from the Democrat
[03:36:38.760 --> 03:36:43.360]  debate and that was where the moderator asked Bernie Sanders as he's going on
[03:36:43.360 --> 03:36:46.520]  and on because all three of them of course all three of them want free
[03:36:46.520 --> 03:36:50.160]  college tuition for everyone free college tuition so the moderator says
[03:36:50.160 --> 03:36:52.720]  well how you gonna pay for that how much of the tax rate is going to have to be
[03:36:52.720 --> 03:36:57.560]  for you to pay that and Bernie Sanders says well I don't know we haven't run
[03:36:57.560 --> 03:37:01.760]  the numbers here but it won't be more than 90% we're not as big a socialist as
[03:37:01.760 --> 03:37:07.400]  Eisenhower was okay well that got a big round of applause and then you had
[03:37:07.400 --> 03:37:12.240]  Governor Malley chime in he goes yes yes we can do this we can we can raise
[03:37:12.240 --> 03:37:17.560]  taxes I mean even Ronald Reagan had a tax rate of 70% at the top he didn't
[03:37:17.560 --> 03:37:22.640]  even say at the top he said he had a tax rate of 70% okay a lot of lies and a
[03:37:22.640 --> 03:37:26.360]  lot of distortion there but think about what was at the very fundamental bottom
[03:37:26.360 --> 03:37:30.840]  of that these guys are proposing a new massive entitlement program have
[03:37:30.840 --> 03:37:36.120]  absolutely no idea no idea and they could care less how much this is going
[03:37:36.120 --> 03:37:41.480]  to cost they could care less because they're socialists and because this is
[03:37:41.480 --> 03:37:46.080]  an entitlement program and they really don't have any idea of how much it's
[03:37:46.080 --> 03:37:49.560]  going to cost because understand what they're doing they're offering right now
[03:37:49.560 --> 03:37:53.720]  and this is not an exaggeration to say that they're offering free tuition to the
[03:37:53.720 --> 03:37:58.560]  entire world to come here and be educated at the expense of the American
[03:37:58.560 --> 03:38:03.200]  taxpayer that is precisely what Bernie Sanders Hilary Clinton and Governor
[03:38:03.200 --> 03:38:06.800]  Malley all the Democrats want when they say we want to have free college
[03:38:06.800 --> 03:38:11.800]  tuition for all they're offering to educate the world at the expense of the
[03:38:11.800 --> 03:38:16.000]  American taxpayer and if you don't believe that consider the fact that
[03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:19.000]  illegal aliens come into the United States and they're able to get in state
[03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:22.680]  college tuition at any state they wish to go to right now under the Dreamer
[03:38:22.680 --> 03:38:27.480]  Act they don't have a problem treating them better than they do American
[03:38:27.480 --> 03:38:31.200]  citizens and their parents who paid taxes all their life so of course they
[03:38:31.200 --> 03:38:34.960]  have no idea of course they don't care about this and of course Bernie
[03:38:34.960 --> 03:38:40.200]  Sandernista the guy who loved the Nicaraguans who loved Daniel Ortega who
[03:38:40.200 --> 03:38:44.400]  went down in 1985 and bragged about what a humanitarian organization this was
[03:38:44.400 --> 03:38:49.840]  the guy was nothing but the worst kind of kleptocrat of crony capitalist of
[03:38:49.840 --> 03:38:54.520]  thief that you can find as big a thief as anybody on Wall Street if not bigger
[03:38:54.520 --> 03:38:58.120]  he seized other people's assets and then when he was driven out by the
[03:38:58.120 --> 03:39:01.960]  communists and the conservatives he kept those assets he reprivatized those
[03:39:01.960 --> 03:39:05.920]  assets and kept them for his own now let's talk about who the real socialists
[03:39:05.920 --> 03:39:10.960]  are the Democrats love FDR Republicans love Ronald Reagan and then in the
[03:39:10.960 --> 03:39:14.560]  middle of these guys kind of halfway between their their different
[03:39:14.560 --> 03:39:18.880]  administrations was the Eisenhower administration so what did FDR do for
[03:39:18.880 --> 03:39:24.320]  the working man well when the working man in 1933 when FDR came in the working
[03:39:24.320 --> 03:39:30.280]  man had a rate of 4% and these rates now I'm talking about dollar figures these
[03:39:30.280 --> 03:39:35.200]  are normalized to 2013 figures and that was a 4% rate all the way up to
[03:39:35.200 --> 03:39:40.640]  $70,000 so anybody that made $70,000 or less they paid 4% income tax rate when
[03:39:40.640 --> 03:39:47.280]  FDR came in okay when he finished the minimum rate went up to 24% and that
[03:39:47.280 --> 03:39:53.360]  kicked in for everybody making and it escalated once you got to $24,000 so
[03:39:53.360 --> 03:39:57.560]  if you made $24,000 or less it was 24% if you made more than that it was more
[03:39:57.560 --> 03:40:05.120]  okay so his minimum rate for the working man was 4% and he jumped it to 24% in
[03:40:05.120 --> 03:40:10.520]  his 12 years in office from 4 to 24% now Eisenhower he began for the the lowest
[03:40:10.520 --> 03:40:16.000]  rate that he had was 22% when he took office and when he left it was 20% when
[03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:19.640]  Ronald Reagan came in the lowest rate was zero percent and when he left it was
[03:40:19.640 --> 03:40:25.480]  15% actually went up on the lowest rate but if you look at the bigger picture if
[03:40:25.480 --> 03:40:30.080]  you look at the the Reagan tax reforms and of course when O'Malley says it was
[03:40:30.080 --> 03:40:34.960]  70% he was talking about the maximum rate that somebody would pay and let's go
[03:40:34.960 --> 03:40:38.880]  back and look at these maximum rates under FDR it was 63% if you had an
[03:40:38.880 --> 03:40:43.960]  income of $17 million or more in one year and then he dropped that level to
[03:40:43.960 --> 03:40:47.440]  two and a half million and raised the rate to 94% but he didn't hurt the
[03:40:47.440 --> 03:40:50.920]  median family as much he didn't hurt the rich guys as much as they hurt the
[03:40:50.920 --> 03:40:54.480]  median family it was essentially unchanged under Eisenhower under Reagan
[03:40:54.480 --> 03:40:58.600]  the top rate was 70% if you made a half million well 544 thousand dollars and
[03:40:58.600 --> 03:41:04.800]  then he dropped it to 28% for everybody that was making $57,000 or more so
[03:41:04.800 --> 03:41:09.260]  Reagan took a complicated system that had 16 tax brackets the highest tax
[03:41:09.260 --> 03:41:12.080]  bracket was a pretty high rate and what he did was he gave you two tax brackets
[03:41:12.080 --> 03:41:17.040]  you make less than 57,000 you had 15% more than 50,000 it was 28%
[03:41:17.040 --> 03:41:20.720]  but and I want to get off of this subject because everybody's listening to
[03:41:20.720 --> 03:41:24.640]  numbers this is radio but just think about what happens to the median family
[03:41:24.640 --> 03:41:29.000]  income the median family income today is just I think it's a 51,000 didn't write
[03:41:29.000 --> 03:41:35.040]  it on my sheet here but from memory here it is 51.9 so say $52,000 how would
[03:41:35.040 --> 03:41:39.360]  that family be taxed under FDR the beginning well that median family income
[03:41:39.360 --> 03:41:43.240]  and again half the people make less than this half the people make more than
[03:41:43.240 --> 03:41:49.560]  this under FDR their taxes would have gone from 4% to 29% under Eisenhower
[03:41:49.560 --> 03:41:55.960]  that median family their taxes would have gone from 34% to 22% gone down under
[03:41:55.960 --> 03:42:01.560]  Reagan they would have gone from 28% to 15% it would have dropped in half so when
[03:42:01.560 --> 03:42:05.560]  Bernie Sanders talks about Eisenhower being a socialist no he dropped rates
[03:42:05.560 --> 03:42:11.560]  from 34 to 22% Reagan dropped them in half but understand that when FDR put
[03:42:11.560 --> 03:42:16.280]  this in when FDR raised the taxes on the median family from 4% to 29% at the
[03:42:16.280 --> 03:42:21.960]  same time he enacted Social Security which was a lie from the very beginning
[03:42:21.960 --> 03:42:25.480]  it was a lie when Bismarck did it in Germany they picked 65 years because they
[03:42:25.480 --> 03:42:29.120]  knew that that was a life expectancy they didn't expect people to survive that
[03:42:29.120 --> 03:42:33.160]  long so they didn't think that have to pay out so it was a Ponzi scheme and now
[03:42:33.160 --> 03:42:36.600]  we've got Republicans and Democrats trying to turn it into outright theft
[03:42:36.600 --> 03:42:40.840]  and fraud having forced people to contribute this for the to this for
[03:42:40.840 --> 03:42:43.640]  their entire life and then pulling the rug out from under them and saying well
[03:42:43.640 --> 03:42:47.040]  we're not going to give you that money because we have decided that you don't
[03:42:47.040 --> 03:42:52.040]  need it thanks a lot thanks a lot understand as well that FDR that
[03:42:52.040 --> 03:42:55.440]  wonderful socialist that champion of the working man who raised their taxes
[03:42:55.440 --> 03:43:01.600]  from 4 to 29% income taxes put on them Social Security the most regressive tax
[03:43:01.600 --> 03:43:05.520]  if you want to use the language of the left regressive means that it falls on
[03:43:05.520 --> 03:43:09.880]  the poorest people most heavily anybody who makes and I don't know what the
[03:43:09.880 --> 03:43:12.960]  upper limit is I've never never gotten to a point where I don't have to pay
[03:43:12.960 --> 03:43:17.080]  Social Security but the upper limit is like 107 or something like this okay so
[03:43:17.080 --> 03:43:19.920]  if you make more than that you don't have to pay any more Social Security but
[03:43:19.920 --> 03:43:23.800]  everybody that makes below that you see it on your paycheck is seven and a half
[03:43:23.800 --> 03:43:29.600]  percent actually 7.62% but the reality is the cost to your employer is over 15
[03:43:29.600 --> 03:43:32.680]  and a half percent because half of it is paid by the employer you don't see that
[03:43:32.680 --> 03:43:36.960]  on your check so the reality is is that for all the people who made less than
[03:43:36.960 --> 03:43:43.200]  six figure incomes you're paying 15% in Social Security plus and that's thank you
[03:43:43.200 --> 03:43:50.200]  FDR and plus you got an extra 25% boost on your income taxes that's what the
[03:43:50.200 --> 03:43:54.360]  Socialists do to the working man that's what they do and we can see that in
[03:43:54.360 --> 03:43:58.400]  Venezuela where they got a 700% return on investment Bloomberg Press was
[03:43:58.400 --> 03:44:03.720]  bragging about how they were getting a 700% return on investment from Nicaragua
[03:44:03.720 --> 03:44:07.520]  at the same time and in that same article bragging about their massive return
[03:44:07.520 --> 03:44:10.760]  on investment saying people had to leave that country in order to get food
[03:44:10.760 --> 03:44:14.720]  water and medicine because they had to pay the bankers first see that's why
[03:44:14.720 --> 03:44:19.440]  the bankers sent linen in with ten million dollars in gold on his train to
[03:44:19.440 --> 03:44:23.240]  start a communist revolution they've been behind this they've been running
[03:44:23.240 --> 03:44:27.680]  both sides of this because they make a tremendous amount of money in these
[03:44:27.680 --> 03:44:31.560]  little socialist utopias that Bernie Sanders is telling you is so good for
[03:44:31.560 --> 03:44:34.280]  you and this is how it's going to work out it's going to work out for the
[03:44:34.280 --> 03:44:38.400]  working man like it did with FDR in terms of tax rates now one of the
[03:44:38.400 --> 03:44:42.480]  instruments that they used to do this is Janet Yellen's Fed Janet Yellen the
[03:44:42.480 --> 03:44:47.440]  chairperson of the Federal Reserve and she is pushing back now on against the
[03:44:47.440 --> 03:44:53.720]  form act this is something that has been proposed and Congress Rand Paul is
[03:44:53.720 --> 03:44:57.720]  involved in this a sponsor I think in the Senate as well as there's a sponsor in
[03:44:57.720 --> 03:45:00.920]  the House they're trying to ram this through so the Federal Reserve is out
[03:45:00.920 --> 03:45:06.240]  there hiring lobbyists hiring lobbyists and Rand Paul commented on that he tried
[03:45:06.240 --> 03:45:09.920]  to offer yet another bill to say look we're not going to let the Federal Reserve
[03:45:09.920 --> 03:45:16.360]  lobby use money that they make off the American people to lobby Congress I he
[03:45:16.360 --> 03:45:21.360]  made if it was reported correctly I think a very inaccurate statement saying the
[03:45:21.360 --> 03:45:24.560]  Federal Reserve is a government agency no they aren't their private
[03:45:24.560 --> 03:45:27.760]  organization they've been given powers by the government they've been given a
[03:45:27.760 --> 03:45:30.900]  monopoly by the government they're not not a government agency and he knows
[03:45:30.900 --> 03:45:35.360]  that so hopefully he just misspoke on that we'll see what happens but
[03:45:35.360 --> 03:45:40.080]  nevertheless the form act attempts to increase transparency and accountability
[03:45:40.080 --> 03:45:45.120]  increase it I you know what there is no transparency there is absolutely no
[03:45:45.120 --> 03:45:50.240]  accountability to the Fed once the chairman is in he comes back and he
[03:45:50.240 --> 03:45:55.080]  tells the Congress what he's going to do and if they don't like it they don't
[03:45:55.080 --> 03:45:58.560]  they don't he doesn't care I mean it's that's what we saw with Greenspan so we
[03:45:58.560 --> 03:46:03.080]  saw a Bernanke so we're going to see with Yellen they do whatever they wish they
[03:46:03.080 --> 03:46:06.300]  will tell Congress to some degree what they're gonna do but if you ask to me
[03:46:06.300 --> 03:46:09.520]  questions to say now I'm gonna talk about that and I'm not gonna show you my
[03:46:09.520 --> 03:46:14.000]  books either they said the Fed oversight reform and modernization act that's
[03:46:14.000 --> 03:46:17.600]  what form means okay they always love these little acronyms it's kind of
[03:46:17.600 --> 03:46:20.600]  silly I don't I wish they wouldn't do that and in the Pentagon you know like
[03:46:20.600 --> 03:46:23.880]  Patriot Act anyway they said it could cause millions of Americans to suffer
[03:46:23.880 --> 03:46:28.880]  as the Fed and it would politicize monetary policy said Janet Yellen
[03:46:28.880 --> 03:46:34.320]  imagine that politicizing monetary policy as if that isn't what's already
[03:46:34.320 --> 03:46:39.600]  happening I mean this is I guess you could say it's not politicized because
[03:46:39.600 --> 03:46:43.880]  they get to do whatever they wish without any response whatsoever or any
[03:46:43.880 --> 03:46:47.640]  accountability to the American people to the public now they say the proposed
[03:46:47.640 --> 03:46:51.080]  law and Congress would require the central bank to tie interest rate policy to a
[03:46:51.080 --> 03:46:57.800]  mathematical rule now how is that politicizing it if you've got a formula
[03:46:57.800 --> 03:47:02.800]  that you're going to set interest rates by how would that politicize it it
[03:47:02.800 --> 03:47:07.160]  doesn't it basically ties the hands of these people who have been rigging and
[03:47:07.160 --> 03:47:13.320]  manipulating the markets since they were handed that power in 1913 and it's
[03:47:13.320 --> 03:47:16.880]  something we really need to keep up on look you need to talk to your congressman
[03:47:16.880 --> 03:47:22.080]  tell them to push this form act tell them to sign up for this and let me give
[03:47:22.080 --> 03:47:24.600]  you some more information on this they say interest rates of course up or down
[03:47:24.600 --> 03:47:27.640]  depending on the readings of economic indicators like the jobless rate and
[03:47:27.640 --> 03:47:30.600]  inflation is what they're talking about it's not really where we ultimately want
[03:47:30.600 --> 03:47:34.480]  to go but it is a small step in the right direction other articles from the
[03:47:34.480 --> 03:47:37.640]  Wall Street Journal point out that it would also give the require the Fed to
[03:47:37.640 --> 03:47:42.880]  disclose more details about the stress tests that they give to banks it would
[03:47:42.880 --> 03:47:47.200]  also give lawmakers more opportunities to scrutinize their policy
[03:47:47.200 --> 03:47:51.200]  Fed officials are also concerned that the government accountability office
[03:47:51.200 --> 03:47:56.120]  reviews of monetary policy decisions that the bill would allow could make the
[03:47:56.120 --> 03:48:00.880]  central bank vulnerable to political pressure see he says wait it's going to
[03:48:00.880 --> 03:48:07.120]  politicize a process okay in reality what it would do is it would really set
[03:48:07.120 --> 03:48:12.240]  up an algorithm for the for the interest rates and it would expose them to some
[03:48:12.240 --> 03:48:16.800]  transparency which is desperately needed and they say last year this actually
[03:48:16.800 --> 03:48:19.640]  made it through the House but it died in the Senate when the Senate was under
[03:48:19.640 --> 03:48:24.240]  Democrat control so there's a possibility that this may go through this
[03:48:24.240 --> 03:48:29.760]  year so here's a chance for you to jump in now on the time that we got left I
[03:48:29.760 --> 03:48:32.560]  want to talk a little bit about what's going on of course with our open
[03:48:32.560 --> 03:48:36.680]  waters and we've talked about this endlessly but we can't stress it enough
[03:48:36.680 --> 03:48:41.960]  that this is about taking down our country taking down Western Europe and I
[03:48:41.960 --> 03:48:45.720]  just want to give you some of the things that are happening right now besides
[03:48:45.720 --> 03:48:51.640]  the situation with Syria we have Cuban migrants a massive wave of Cuban
[03:48:51.640 --> 03:48:56.200]  migrants coming through Central America to the United States because they get
[03:48:56.200 --> 03:48:59.720]  special treatment of all other people they get treated better than Mexicans
[03:48:59.720 --> 03:49:02.720]  they get treated better than Nicaraguans than anybody else in Central America
[03:49:02.720 --> 03:49:07.680]  there's a special place in our government's heart for Cubans and we have
[03:49:07.680 --> 03:49:11.720]  Cubans running for president right now that came in that in my opinion don't
[03:49:11.720 --> 03:49:16.840]  reach the requirements of natural-born citizens especially Ted Cruz but this is
[03:49:16.840 --> 03:49:20.680]  what's happening now at Nicaragua and again remember Bernie Sandernista he
[03:49:20.680 --> 03:49:25.160]  loved the Sandernistas he loved Nicaragua and he thinks this is you know
[03:49:25.160 --> 03:49:29.280]  that's just a paradise he couldn't say enough good things about them in 1985
[03:49:29.280 --> 03:49:33.960]  and what are they doing now well Nicaragua is dispatching its military
[03:49:33.960 --> 03:49:37.840]  and its police to help close its southern borders and a dispute with Costa
[03:49:37.840 --> 03:49:41.800]  Rica over the passage of Cuban migrants on their way to the US these are not
[03:49:41.800 --> 03:49:45.160]  even people that would be staying in Nicaragua they don't even want to allow
[03:49:45.160 --> 03:49:49.560]  these people to pass through so what did they do well Costa Rica decided on
[03:49:49.560 --> 03:49:54.400]  Saturday to grant a seven-day transit visa they had 1200 Cuban migrants who
[03:49:54.400 --> 03:49:59.520]  went into Costa Rica through Panama and Nicaragua is saying wait a minute you're
[03:49:59.520 --> 03:50:05.760]  violating our national sovereignty oh they sound like American governors who
[03:50:05.760 --> 03:50:10.120]  are talking about national sovereignty being violated I mean that this is
[03:50:10.120 --> 03:50:14.040]  something the left must really hate Nicaragua right now Nicaragua's
[03:50:14.040 --> 03:50:17.440]  government said in a statement over the weekend that it violated their national
[03:50:17.440 --> 03:50:20.440]  sovereignty and then they sent out troops and riot police they fired tear gas
[03:50:20.440 --> 03:50:25.680]  at people who are trying to enter Nicaragua on Sunday so they take their
[03:50:25.680 --> 03:50:29.720]  borders seriously they take their national sovereignty seriously how
[03:50:29.720 --> 03:50:35.040]  politically incorrect of our Sandernistas down there and they point out
[03:50:35.040 --> 03:50:39.360]  that this is all spiked since Obama has changed the status they're giving special
[03:50:39.360 --> 03:50:43.560]  status to people coming in from Cuba even though we are now embracing the
[03:50:43.560 --> 03:50:49.240]  Cubans and Obama praises the Cuban dreamers in Spanish saying this is the
[03:50:49.240 --> 03:50:53.480]  opening of the US in case you've got any doubts about it stay with us when we
[03:50:53.480 --> 03:50:56.560]  come back we're going to talk about the solution to this the Kentucky
[03:50:56.560 --> 03:51:01.760]  Resolutions the 217th anniversary was yesterday my name is Don Wiscan in 1994

[03:51:05.800 --> 03:51:10.880]  1977 my 44 year old brother was found dead in his apartment he suffered a
[03:51:10.880 --> 03:51:15.280]  heart attack in January of 98 my mother had a stroke and passed away in her bed
[03:51:15.280 --> 03:51:19.840]  21 days later my 53 year old brother passed away on his arrival to the
[03:51:19.840 --> 03:51:24.840]  hospital he waited too long in June that same year I almost joined them at 42

[03:54:24.480 --> 03:54:29.200]  aspect of this we had the 217th anniversary yesterday and look at
[03:54:29.200 --> 03:54:33.320]  that and see what that tells us about the true political power in this country
[03:54:33.320 --> 03:54:37.320]  where it rightfully resides before we do real quickly I just want to let you

[03:55:08.480 --> 03:55:14.040]  elsewhere will be increased to 100,000 dollars per year for at least I'm sorry
[03:55:14.040 --> 03:55:17.560]  100,000 immigrants each year they're gonna be a lot more than a hundred
[03:55:17.560 --> 03:55:21.840]  thousand dollars let me tell you that he says and of course he's backed up by
[03:55:21.840 --> 03:55:26.080]  John Kerry Secretary of State saying that the 10,000 refugees is actually a
[03:55:26.080 --> 03:55:31.160]  floor not a ceiling and they're going to take in 100,000 from Syria is their
[03:55:31.160 --> 03:55:34.280]  goal at least for the next two years and those are just the people that we're
[03:55:34.280 --> 03:55:39.040]  gonna fly in the rest of them you know they can walk across the borders we saw
[03:55:39.040 --> 03:55:45.440]  Joe Biggs do they can even wear their ISIS balaclavas and carry a severed
[03:55:45.440 --> 03:55:48.400]  head with them and walk across the border as Joe Biggs did and nobody will
[03:55:48.400 --> 03:55:52.120]  bother them because they're wide open just as Obama was telling the Cubans
[03:55:52.120 --> 03:55:57.080]  welcome you know this is the opening of America you have the opening to what we
[03:55:57.080 --> 03:56:00.560]  need to ask especially in light of what we've seen happening in Europe this is
[03:56:00.560 --> 03:56:03.840]  predicted we all knew this was going to happen we've seen it fulfilled now and
[03:56:03.840 --> 03:56:09.600]  yet it is still full speed ahead for the open border globalists they're now
[03:56:09.600 --> 03:56:13.360]  opening facilities in the Middle East to speed up processing of Syrian
[03:56:13.360 --> 03:56:17.360]  refugees they're going to open up a refugee settlement processing center in
[03:56:17.360 --> 03:56:21.880]  Iraq before the end of 2015 they'll resume refugee processing in Lebanon in
[03:56:21.880 --> 03:56:26.400]  early 2016 so they're ramping all of this stuff up so how do we stop this
[03:56:26.400 --> 03:56:29.800]  because we saw over the weekend first it started out with six governors saying
[03:56:29.800 --> 03:56:34.400]  you're not gonna put them in my state and we had yesterday went from 21 now it
[03:56:34.400 --> 03:56:39.440]  is over 25 and of course as they escalated the last two states were
[03:56:39.440 --> 03:56:43.480]  Massachusetts and Maine I know Massachusetts Democrat I think Maine is as
[03:56:43.480 --> 03:56:47.600]  well I'm pretty certain it is and yet you see when the New York Times talks
[03:56:47.600 --> 03:56:52.640]  about this they talk about this is mostly Republican governors no it's not
[03:56:52.640 --> 03:56:56.520]  that's the way they want to spin it and of course the president says it would be
[03:56:56.520 --> 03:57:02.860]  a betrayal of our values that's his values it's not our values it's not the
[03:57:02.860 --> 03:57:07.600]  law of our country that is what Obama is unilaterally unconstitutionally doing
[03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:12.520]  and if we had a real opposition party in Washington they would have impeached him
[03:57:12.520 --> 03:57:16.080]  by now but of course they're just a pretend opposition party how do we
[03:57:16.080 --> 03:57:20.080]  really stop this was a great article on New American the 217th anniversary
[03:57:20.080 --> 03:57:24.120]  signing of the Kentucky resolution of 1798 what we have forgotten and I want
[03:57:24.120 --> 03:57:27.800]  to go over this article because it's very important and of course what happened
[03:57:27.800 --> 03:57:31.800]  was this is in response to the alien and sedition acts that were put in by John
[03:57:31.800 --> 03:57:37.240]  Adams in the summer of 1798 what that meant was let's look at the well first of
[03:57:37.240 --> 03:57:40.360]  all the alien acts was exactly the opposite of what our president is doing
[03:57:40.360 --> 03:57:43.920]  right now it gave power to the president to declare foreign residents in the US
[03:57:43.920 --> 03:57:47.840]  to be enemies of the state and have them jailed or deported just the opposite of
[03:57:47.840 --> 03:57:51.560]  what our president does right now but it also had something else it was very
[03:57:51.560 --> 03:57:56.240]  troubling that was a sedition act I'm out of time we're gonna have the nightly
[03:57:56.240 --> 03:58:00.200]  news tonight at seven maybe we'll cover this tonight but what happened was they
[03:58:00.200 --> 03:58:03.840]  actually would jail people for criticizing the government what was the
[03:58:03.840 --> 03:58:09.520]  rifle red resolution of this Jefferson Madison said the power resides in the
[03:58:09.520 --> 03:58:13.760]  states that's where we have to fight this we've got governors like Greg Abbott
[03:58:13.760 --> 03:58:17.800]  and others who will stand up and fight this that's what we need to do is fight
[03:58:17.800 --> 03:58:23.120]  it at the state level so join us tonight at seven central 8 p.m. Eastern for the
[03:58:23.120 --> 03:58:39.040]  nightly news Leon McAdoo will be the host then
