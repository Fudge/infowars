[02:57.240 --> 03:01.800]  just all the evidence that it's staged that we're gonna go over today but the
[03:01.800 --> 03:06.760]  way it's hyped instantly in the president stopping short his trip and
[03:06.760 --> 03:12.720]  then in Hawaii getting minute-by-minute reports and being told about if someone
[03:12.720 --> 03:18.240]  drops an old shoe somewhere in Albuquerque New Mexico and was somebody in
[03:18.240 --> 03:22.680]  the potty more than 10 minutes on another flight and hyperventilating and
[03:22.680 --> 03:27.160]  everyone in fear hoping more FEMA camps are built hoping they'll surveil us

[08:00.200 --> 08:05.640]  the Genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones
[08:05.640 --> 08:10.760]  show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:12.320 --> 08:20.480]  there is absolutely no doubt that the United States Western Europe Australian
[08:20.480 --> 08:28.680]  New Zealand and Canada are being turned into heavily armed
[08:28.680 --> 08:36.000]  high-tech surveilled robbery centers everything is being designed for the
[08:36.000 --> 08:43.160]  looting for the robbing for the societal cultural economic raping of the
[08:43.160 --> 08:49.360]  people there is absolutely no doubt the entire system is completely bankrupt a
[08:49.360 --> 08:55.520]  fraud the big banks want to bankrupt society financially so they can bring
[08:55.520 --> 09:01.520]  the entire planet into receivership the states are all in the process of going
[09:01.520 --> 09:05.360]  bankrupt and as you see that happening you see the state
[09:05.360 --> 09:09.120]  budgets going up the federal budgets going up the spending just being
[09:09.120 --> 09:14.720]  accelerated every form of liberty and freedom being
[09:14.720 --> 09:21.280]  abridged and abolished and desecrated defiled
[09:23.440 --> 09:27.840]  our biggest problem all of us is that we don't consciously every day
[09:27.840 --> 09:34.480]  let it really burn into our psyches and into our intellects
[09:35.200 --> 09:40.240]  both intellectually at a cold-blooded level and at an emotional level we don't
[09:40.240 --> 09:45.600]  let it really soak in just how much trouble we're in
[09:46.800 --> 09:50.320]  now in the coming days i'm going to have here in review i'm going to have
[09:50.320 --> 09:55.520]  decade in review looking forward into the next decade
[09:56.160 --> 09:59.520]  we're going to obviously go over government takeover of healthcare and
[09:59.520 --> 10:02.320]  what's really in it
[10:04.080 --> 10:07.200]  and what an amazing statement it is by chris mathews that
[10:07.200 --> 10:11.040]  his hero is sol olensky who was an open
[10:11.040 --> 10:18.240]  hardcore communist who openly called for reeducation camps in america
[10:18.240 --> 10:23.200]  years ago i bought rules for radicals one of the first editions that had the
[10:23.200 --> 10:27.280]  pledge to lucifer in the in the introduction it's dedicated and
[10:27.280 --> 10:30.720]  pledge to lucifer i was digging around for it last
[10:30.720 --> 10:33.520]  night since we moved offices it's hard to find anything but
[10:33.520 --> 10:38.640]  hundreds and hundreds of books here but it doesn't matter it's on record that he
[10:38.640 --> 10:42.000]  pledged the book to lucifer who can make that up
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.840]  that hillary wrote her thesis her phd thesis to sol olensky
[10:47.840 --> 10:53.600]  and it's sealed under national security obama wrote one of his major papers on
[10:53.600 --> 10:58.080]  sol olensky i mean we really do have communist running
[10:58.080 --> 11:02.480]  america it's really happening and they really do
[11:02.480 --> 11:06.160]  work for big banks just like they did in the soviet union
[11:06.160 --> 11:09.680]  and in communist china david rockefeller writes in his memoirs
[11:09.680 --> 11:13.600]  how they funded the communist chinese they funded the un
[11:13.600 --> 11:18.000]  these people are such criminals and they think it's all funny
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.800]  they praise mousetown and new york time editorials one that
[11:22.800 --> 11:26.000]  rockefeller wrote that i've gotten the film in game
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.680]  i don't just have an article about him saying that we went to the microfilm
[11:29.680 --> 11:33.600]  at the university of texas the micro fish and pulled it up
[11:33.600 --> 11:37.440]  how great what stalin did was how great
[11:37.440 --> 11:43.680]  what lennon did how great mal was these guys all constantly write about it
[11:43.680 --> 11:48.240]  and of course they're all trillionaires they control trillions
[11:48.240 --> 11:52.560]  they're all tax-free government is their tool
[11:52.560 --> 11:56.320]  and their vanguard their enforcers are the communist
[11:56.320 --> 12:00.960]  they're not communist that doesn't exist they're robbers
[12:00.960 --> 12:04.320]  and what they do is throw out a little bit of chicken feed
[12:04.320 --> 12:08.400]  on average one dollar for every thirty the bank
[12:08.400 --> 12:12.640]  steal they give one it's like a pirate captain
[12:12.640 --> 12:17.120]  who keeps thirty dollars thirty gold pieces for themselves
[12:17.120 --> 12:21.600]  and then gives the entire crew of pirates one gold piece
[12:21.600 --> 12:27.600]  and they love it and so they've got the country domesticated half the country
[12:27.600 --> 12:30.640]  is now sucking off the other half and and now they're
[12:30.640 --> 12:34.240]  getting ready to close in ranks and to totally destroy
[12:34.240 --> 12:40.640]  anybody with any wealth who isn't an elitist
[12:40.640 --> 12:43.760]  and i've got all the mainstream news articles where
[12:43.760 --> 12:49.760]  in detroit and la and dallas and every other major city i look up
[12:49.760 --> 12:53.840]  they're openly taking the boy scouts away from the boy scouts
[12:53.840 --> 12:57.280]  and openly giving it to the police department in la
[12:57.280 --> 13:02.960]  they've already trained 3000 inner city kids just like in russia they hire the
[13:02.960 --> 13:05.440]  poor kids they take the cps kids they're in the
[13:05.440 --> 13:09.280]  program the foster kids
[13:09.280 --> 13:13.680]  and they literally turn them into enforcers russia did this 30 40 years
[13:13.680 --> 13:17.920]  ago it's now happening here hitler did it
[13:17.920 --> 13:23.120]  and they openly are on the news training the kids to quote take on american
[13:23.120 --> 13:26.640]  gun owners i mean it doesn't get more hardcore police
[13:26.640 --> 13:30.160]  state than that that's coming up you know i talked some about it
[13:30.160 --> 13:35.680]  yesterday i want to talk more today inner poll executive order
[13:35.680 --> 13:38.880]  given unlimited
[13:39.520 --> 13:41.920]  power
[13:41.920 --> 13:50.000]  inside the united states even national review the little cia front
[13:50.000 --> 13:56.000]  organizations decrying it started by william f buckley

[14:01.280 --> 14:06.000]  um obama gives diplomatic immunity to inner poll
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.440]  national review i want that version and then go to the other
[14:09.440 --> 14:13.360]  article memo posted about it he had like five six links to mainstream news
[14:13.360 --> 14:16.000]  when i cover that i want to source mainstream because people have a
[14:16.000 --> 14:19.360]  conditioning mechanism in them especially new listeners that they just
[14:19.360 --> 14:24.480]  out of hand anything scary they just deny it exist
[14:24.480 --> 14:28.480]  people are scared of the dark and fairy tales and things that aren't real but
[14:28.480 --> 14:33.920]  they're not scared of real things i can't tell you how many adult men when
[14:33.920 --> 14:36.480]  when i've been out deer hunting or something i say hey let's go for a walk
[14:36.480 --> 14:40.640]  at night to the woods and full grown men 90 of them
[14:40.640 --> 14:44.640]  i've done this many times are scared and want to turn back
[14:44.640 --> 14:49.680]  men are scared of the dark when there's nothing out there
[14:49.680 --> 14:54.560]  we're the ultimate predator when you're walking around in the woods
[14:54.560 --> 14:58.400]  but they're not scared of a big giant global government that openly writes
[14:58.400 --> 15:01.920]  giant textbooks about how they're poisoning your water supply and plan to
[15:01.920 --> 15:05.200]  kill you and your family now don't be scared of something
[15:05.200 --> 15:12.080]  actually that's completely tyrannical the tyrannosaurus rex of tyranny
[15:15.680 --> 15:18.800]  i just don't even know what to say anymore it's so mind-blowing
[15:18.800 --> 15:23.360]  and all of these establishment types on the left and right who think they're
[15:23.360 --> 15:26.880]  part of the power structure in the system and who are going to quote play it
[15:26.880 --> 15:30.800]  safe and not get involved and not speak up or get or stand up to tyranny
[15:30.800 --> 15:33.920]  you have any idea what's happening to us right now
[15:33.920 --> 15:38.800]  you have any idea we're in the process of being completely robbed
[15:42.000 --> 15:48.080]  and i read about inner pole do you know inner pole and the united nations have

[24:16.640 --> 24:19.040]  bomber
[24:19.600 --> 24:27.600]  all of the evidence the physical evidence the eyewitness evidence
[24:27.600 --> 24:32.000]  the man bringing him through the airport getting him on the plane without a
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.080]  passport his father going and warning the
[24:36.080 --> 24:39.920]  government since the state department the fact that he was kept
[24:39.920 --> 24:43.520]  off the terror watch list to come to the us
[24:43.520 --> 24:47.840]  it's the same mo we've seen a million times
[24:47.840 --> 24:51.760]  now you have confirmed someone on the plane videotaping
[24:51.760 --> 24:56.560]  him with his camera on him from start to finish
[24:58.080 --> 25:02.080]  guaranteed he was told it was part of a drill that's how they set these young
[25:02.080 --> 25:08.080]  idiots up and now they'll drug him up torturing
[25:08.080 --> 25:11.440]  body doubling whenever they have to and have a big show trial out of it
[25:11.440 --> 25:15.360]  now they're saying 25 al-qaeda's are going to hit you
[25:15.360 --> 25:18.240]  the government's got to take all your rights and your bank account by the way
[25:18.240 --> 25:20.320]  to keep you safe paul watson's written some key
[25:20.320 --> 25:23.040]  articles at prisonplanet.com so is curtain ammo
[25:23.040 --> 25:28.400]  paul watson thank you for joining us thanks ally okay run through the evidence
[25:28.400 --> 25:31.440]  the details the background in this segment a little bit to the next
[25:31.440 --> 25:37.520]  go ahead well yeah this uh individual um
[25:37.520 --> 25:42.320]  mollusk i think his name is is motelab is the pronunciation
[25:42.320 --> 25:48.560]  he's a nigerian that um bought a ticket for a round trip flight which cost him
[25:48.560 --> 25:55.600]  $2,800 from nigeria to detroit via amsterdam and uh
[25:55.600 --> 25:59.520]  for that huge trip he only had one small carry-on back
[25:59.520 --> 26:03.600]  for his luggage which was the first red flag
[26:03.600 --> 26:07.040]  then of course he's on the terror watch list
[26:07.040 --> 26:10.800]  his father warns us intelligence a month ago
[26:10.800 --> 26:16.080]  that he thinks he's a threat he's accompanied by this um
[26:16.080 --> 26:20.000]  what eyewitnesses who were on the plane described as a sharp dressed man it
[26:20.000 --> 26:24.400]  later emerged that he was um indian looking
[26:24.400 --> 26:31.040]  he lied about the circumstances of the uh underwear bomber said he was a
[26:31.040 --> 26:36.000]  yemen refugee even though he's nigerian and uh
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.760]  basically he got him on the plane without a passport
[26:39.760 --> 26:44.160]  via whatever means now what's interesting about that is that
[26:44.160 --> 26:49.760]  after the incident when he was arrested um eyewitnesses also described the
[26:49.760 --> 26:55.680]  second man being detained by the fbi but the fbi says they only ever detained
[26:55.680 --> 26:59.680]  the um terrorist so what happened to that man
[26:59.680 --> 27:03.680]  whether he was a handler it seems pretty clear that he was involved
[27:03.680 --> 27:08.720]  deeply and then of course you've got the reports which you just mentioned about
[27:08.720 --> 27:14.480]  the man calmly filming the entire flight from start to finish and filming
[27:14.480 --> 27:18.400]  the entire um scenario where he attempted to
[27:18.400 --> 27:25.200]  detonate this device now from every fact it to me it seems that this was
[27:25.200 --> 27:29.760]  a contrived scare it was never meant to blow up the plane
[27:29.760 --> 27:33.760]  um and now the reports are saying that even the
[27:33.760 --> 27:37.680]  bomber himself said that he never meant to blow up the plane
[27:37.680 --> 27:41.760]  and that the liquid and the explosive devices he had
[27:41.760 --> 27:44.960]  were not enough to blow up the plane and of course
[27:44.960 --> 27:49.120]  all he managed to do was to set fire to the wall of the plane and
[27:49.120 --> 27:53.760]  those fires were soon extinguished and the result of
[27:53.760 --> 27:59.520]  all of this is that now the uh government of the united states and
[27:59.520 --> 28:02.560]  britain are saying in fact that the british
[28:02.560 --> 28:07.120]  government this morning is saying that as a result of this incident
[28:07.120 --> 28:12.000]  the use of full body scanners which of course produced a
[28:12.000 --> 28:16.320]  naked image of passengers will have to be implemented
[28:16.320 --> 28:20.720]  at every airport and this notice this is right as it's being implemented in
[28:20.720 --> 28:23.840]  every major airport and as people are refusing
[28:23.840 --> 28:28.000]  the naked body scanners that record your children's bodies your bodies
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.920]  in a biometric database so they can scan you from a distance
[28:31.920 --> 28:37.360]  that's the real reason oh now if you refuse oh you're gonna have to pay so
[28:37.360 --> 28:41.600]  this is all about making us submit and the airports are the main beta
[28:41.600 --> 28:45.040]  testing centers for society to train us how to be good
[28:45.040 --> 28:47.920]  slaves that's right because after the um
[28:47.920 --> 28:50.960]  richard reid shoe bombing attempt that was when they
[28:50.960 --> 28:54.800]  ordered us all to take off our shoes when we walked through security so now as
[28:54.800 --> 28:57.840]  a result of this we're going to be ordered to go through this naked
[28:57.840 --> 29:02.160]  scanning machine and the importance of it is that if a person ever was to pull
[29:02.160 --> 29:04.800]  something out of their rectum we'll all have to have
[29:04.800 --> 29:08.640]  proctology exams uh at the airport and and we're not joking
[29:08.640 --> 29:11.680]  about this their homeland security is looking
[29:11.680 --> 29:14.880]  at making you wear taser bracelets all of you
[29:14.880 --> 29:18.640]  this is your dog training this is you being brought
[29:18.640 --> 29:25.200]  to your knees go ahead and um what's important about it is that
[29:25.200 --> 29:30.560]  in any major city where you visit a public building or a museum or anything
[29:30.560 --> 29:34.960]  like that you now have to go through airport dial
[29:34.960 --> 29:39.520]  scanning machine this is being introduced on our street and in our shopping mall
[29:39.520 --> 29:43.120]  this is the government circling the wagons against the people
[29:43.120 --> 29:46.800]  this whole airport system as ridge said seven years ago
[29:46.800 --> 29:51.440]  is the plan to take over complete society
[29:51.440 --> 29:55.280]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[29:55.280 --> 30:00.080]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[30:00.080 --> 30:05.920]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[30:05.920 --> 30:10.160]  this is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this
[30:10.160 --> 30:13.200]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[30:13.200 --> 30:16.400]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[30:16.400 --> 30:20.720]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[30:20.720 --> 30:24.960]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay
[30:24.960 --> 30:28.320]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[30:28.320 --> 30:31.840]  nation the criminal off-short cartel hell bent on
[30:31.840 --> 30:35.200]  destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[30:35.200 --> 30:38.000]  government tim geithner bernanke their arsonists
[30:38.000 --> 30:41.360]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the
[30:41.360 --> 30:44.160]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care

[34:10.880 --> 34:14.880]  ladies and gentlemen it's not only that a sharp dress man in a suit went past
[34:14.880 --> 34:19.600]  security flashing some type of credentials
[34:19.600 --> 34:22.560]  imagine this at a european international airport somebody coming out of
[34:22.560 --> 34:27.360]  nigeria they go through the security checkpoint
[34:28.640 --> 34:32.320]  flash their credentials and gets him on the plane
[34:32.320 --> 34:36.240]  without a passport or id
[34:38.240 --> 34:42.320]  and lying and saying he was from sudan then he gets on the plane everybody's
[34:42.320 --> 34:44.560]  marveling why is a guy sitting there a few
[34:44.560 --> 34:53.200]  miles back videotaping this this uh young black man continually
[34:54.480 --> 34:59.600]  well that's the handler it's okay sonny see i'm here filming this is part of a
[34:59.600 --> 35:02.960]  drill we're filming this for the drill the airline knows you
[35:02.960 --> 35:07.040]  have the security man bringing on board the plane you can be part of this
[35:07.040 --> 35:11.600]  and the same thing happened on seven seven
[35:11.600 --> 35:14.960]  those guys had been approached they'd been part of drills
[35:14.960 --> 35:18.080]  a few of them escaped they got chased down in machine gunned
[35:18.080 --> 35:22.800]  that was in british tv and radio that day but got shut down
[35:22.800 --> 35:28.000]  witnesses reported the police chasing them down gunning them down
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.760]  they then thought separately that uh the young
[35:31.760 --> 35:37.840]  brazilian electrician was one of them so they executed him witnesses said
[35:37.840 --> 35:44.720]  they walked up shot him 12 times in the head execution style
[35:44.720 --> 35:48.400]  stood up and said all right job done
[35:49.440 --> 35:53.520]  and the guy said no no please no
[35:54.000 --> 35:58.400]  it's so sick how they run these operations it's just like the fort hood
[35:58.400 --> 36:01.120]  shooter witnesses reported hearing gunfire
[36:01.120 --> 36:04.960]  continue after he was on the ground they reported multiple shooters same thing
[36:04.960 --> 36:08.720]  with columbine the russians have been caught running
[36:08.720 --> 36:13.040]  similar ops you go into a school or a building you shoot a bunch of people
[36:13.040 --> 36:16.720]  you dress up one of the people you blast as the terrorist
[36:16.720 --> 36:22.560]  you and police uniforms escape out the back door because you are the police
[36:22.560 --> 36:26.880]  and if you understand that this is done by all major governments you're living
[36:26.880 --> 36:31.360]  on another planet it's been declassified that our
[36:31.360 --> 36:34.960]  government did it several hundred times under operation gladio
[36:34.960 --> 36:39.120]  and the nato option in europe every time they wanted to demonize some political
[36:39.120 --> 36:43.280]  group they'd stage bombings and blame it on their political enemies
[36:43.280 --> 36:47.360]  but you are the enemy the general population of the left
[36:47.360 --> 36:50.960]  this is all for you remember when we got the secret homeland security and
[36:50.960 --> 36:55.360]  my act documents how all of homeland security and north com is set up for
[36:55.360 --> 36:59.520]  gun owners veterans conservatives libertarians people
[36:59.520 --> 37:03.040]  that want to quote bring the bankers to justice
[37:03.040 --> 37:06.480]  that's the illegitimate government how are the bankers going to have their
[37:06.480 --> 37:09.200]  heist they set up an internal police force
[37:09.200 --> 37:13.680]  they staged terror attacks as a pretext to clamp down on the people they're
[37:13.680 --> 37:19.600]  robbing period and i wished over
[37:19.600 --> 37:25.520]  and over and over and over and over and over again
[37:25.520 --> 37:32.720]  on friday on christmas when i heard about this
[37:32.720 --> 37:36.400]  i said let it be a real low nut i know there's some real muslim terrorist out
[37:36.400 --> 37:41.280]  there let it let it be but as soon as i saw the hype i said oh no
[37:41.280 --> 37:44.800]  and then it came out that he was led on the plane and protected and there's a
[37:44.800 --> 37:48.880]  guy on the plane videotape and even his dad called up and warmed and his dad's
[37:48.880 --> 37:51.840]  a high-level banker and he was on the terror list but the u.s.
[37:51.840 --> 37:55.120]  government had him taken off the terror list i mean they put congressmen on
[37:55.120 --> 37:58.160]  that thing they put a million
[37:58.160 --> 38:00.560]  it's more like a million and a half in the last year they don't give you the
[38:00.560 --> 38:03.040]  numbers anymore it was over a million two hundred thousand
[38:03.040 --> 38:06.080]  and they just put innocent people on it and now they say gun owners are going
[38:06.080 --> 38:08.720]  to be on it if you got bad credit you're going to be on it
[38:08.720 --> 38:12.800]  but this guy is running around publicly at university two years ago saying
[38:12.800 --> 38:16.880]  i want to carry out jihad clearly they're
[38:16.880 --> 38:20.720]  hired to try to flush out other muslim students and set them up
[38:20.720 --> 38:25.760]  guaranteed i saw this with mcvey we saw this with lee harvey oswald
[38:25.760 --> 38:30.240]  we saw this with sir hand sir hand it never ends
[38:30.240 --> 38:36.640]  mohammed adah trained at u.s military bases on record
[38:36.640 --> 38:39.360]  and then the media just goes oh we're not going to discuss why they were trained
[38:39.360 --> 38:42.000]  at bases all right i'm going to shut up and let
[38:42.000 --> 38:45.120]  watson finish and i'm going to get on to some other news
[38:45.120 --> 38:48.480]  it's just it's so obvious i mean watson
[38:48.480 --> 38:51.920]  the media always loves this psychology
[38:51.920 --> 38:55.360]  i had atlantic monthly here a few weeks ago and
[38:55.360 --> 38:58.480]  i had a bunch of other newspapers and magazines the last few weeks
[38:58.480 --> 39:01.840]  and they always say the same cliche they say don't you just want to believe the
[39:01.840 --> 39:04.640]  government's doing this because that brings order to the world and
[39:04.640 --> 39:08.960]  and it's less scary than than than rogue terrorists and i said really
[39:08.960 --> 39:12.320]  a government that runs my life and surveils everything i do
[39:12.320 --> 39:15.920]  that has the power to destroy me through taxes
[39:15.920 --> 39:19.600]  it's less scary to think random guys in a cave
[39:19.600 --> 39:23.600]  did this it's a lot more scary to know the government did it
[39:23.600 --> 39:28.400]  and that there's a giant police state grid in place
[39:29.120 --> 39:34.160]  but it's that cliche of oh we just we just want to believe it's it's it's the
[39:34.160 --> 39:39.840]  government no i want to believe al-qaeda is real i want to believe it
[39:39.840 --> 39:44.080]  but it's not true can you imagine knowing it's the government
[39:44.080 --> 39:47.440]  and having to get up on the radio and point this out
[39:47.440 --> 39:51.440]  and have them run all their co-intel pro operations against us
[39:51.440 --> 39:55.280]  can you imagine what this is like but i've got to tell the truth here
[39:55.280 --> 40:01.680]  paul watson finish up with this what's developing here and how it's being used
[40:01.680 --> 40:05.680]  i mean i have a bbc clip and i have other tv clips from the u.s where
[40:05.680 --> 40:08.400]  you can't put your hands in your lap you can't cover your hands
[40:08.400 --> 40:11.040]  you can't have a blanket you can't get up to go to the bathroom
[40:11.040 --> 40:15.920]  you can't have electronic devices uh you've got to have the body scanners now
[40:15.920 --> 40:19.200]  i mean they're clearly selling this to set the precedent
[40:19.200 --> 40:22.960]  for total police state supermax level prison
[40:22.960 --> 40:26.560]  in the airports and planes now to be put on the streets of america
[40:26.560 --> 40:31.280]  which the tsa admits they're doing this is the total lockdown of the world
[40:31.280 --> 40:36.080]  watson that's right and to pick up on your previous
[40:36.080 --> 40:40.720]  point about how it's contrived and it's blown out of proportion
[40:40.720 --> 40:44.160]  when it's a government provocateur incident
[40:44.160 --> 40:48.480]  when compared to a lone nut which do occasionally happen
[40:48.480 --> 40:54.000]  um there was a big bust in well it was big but it wasn't reported as such
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.560]  in england last year and they found a rocket launcher
[40:58.560 --> 41:03.680]  um and plans to attack airliners at the home of this neo nazi
[41:03.680 --> 41:06.960]  and it was because he was a white guy and it didn't fit into that you know
[41:06.960 --> 41:10.880]  muslims are going to get as old picture book scenario
[41:10.880 --> 41:15.040]  it got in one local newspaper and the story barely even went national never
[41:15.040 --> 41:18.080]  mind and of course it did turn out that that was part of a drill
[41:18.080 --> 41:22.400]  99 of the time it's like finding a four-leaf clover
[41:22.400 --> 41:27.600]  to actually find a real terror attack 99 plus percent of the time it's always a
[41:27.600 --> 41:30.240]  drill and they always hire some idiot to be
[41:30.240 --> 41:34.320]  part of the drill and then set them up right and the
[41:34.320 --> 41:38.320]  the propaganda that's emanated from this is clear how they
[41:38.320 --> 41:41.920]  how they've seized upon it the associate press
[41:41.920 --> 41:46.720]  is now reporting today quote crippling and law enforcement officials said
[41:46.720 --> 41:50.080]  modern airport screening machines could have detected the chemical
[41:50.080 --> 41:53.360]  airport puffer machines the devices that blow air onto a
[41:53.360 --> 41:57.120]  passenger to collect and analyze residues of course totally invasive
[41:57.120 --> 42:01.360]  would probably have detected the powder as would bomb sniffing dogs or hands on
[42:01.360 --> 42:04.880]  the search using a swab you know or maybe they just shouldn't let somebody on
[42:04.880 --> 42:08.400]  which is what morris strong once shut down travel track everything we're
[42:08.400 --> 42:13.680]  doing put global taxes on air travel and of course they never point out that
[42:13.680 --> 42:17.920]  this guy was led through security this guy was kept off the watch list
[42:17.920 --> 42:22.400]  just like mohammed add a was they don't they don't ask why he was let on the
[42:22.400 --> 42:26.240]  plane when he's on a terror watch list and had no passport it's all about how
[42:26.240 --> 42:30.240]  we now need to be oppressed because of it and we need to give the globalist
[42:30.240 --> 42:35.040]  companies that make billions per nation a year off the new stupid machines
[42:35.040 --> 42:38.560]  right which which were in trouble because a lot of airports were starting to back
[42:38.560 --> 42:44.160]  away from them and it it continues quote how because people aren't traveling
[42:44.160 --> 42:47.680]  yeah i mean business travelers we get waiting up to four hours now and they're
[42:47.680 --> 42:50.800]  just saying i'm just not going to travel so it's going to cripple the economy
[42:50.800 --> 42:55.760]  even further as well but it says it continues quote however
[42:55.760 --> 42:59.280]  most passengers in airports only go through magnetometers which detect
[42:59.280 --> 43:02.640]  metal rather than explosives hidden in abdull
[43:02.640 --> 43:06.800]  muscle abs clothing the explosive might also be detected by the full body
[43:06.800 --> 43:11.280]  imaging scanners now making their way into airports and that's exactly what
[43:11.280 --> 43:15.200]  and again let's remind people well so we gotta have the body scanners
[43:15.200 --> 43:18.400]  you can't refuse because almost everybody's saying no to them now they
[43:18.400 --> 43:21.920]  found out what they are they can also cause cancer it's high powered
[43:21.920 --> 43:25.920]  things shoots right through your clothes uh but but but watson
[43:25.920 --> 43:29.760]  again there's hardly any mention in our news that it's confirmed
[43:29.760 --> 43:33.120]  that he was walked through security without a passport
[43:33.120 --> 43:37.600]  no one else can do that only remember watching you've got it and again i've
[43:37.600 --> 43:39.680]  only got watching i've only got steve only got curt
[43:39.680 --> 43:43.760]  and erin part time on stories because i can't find riders that understand
[43:43.760 --> 43:48.720]  the full spectrum of this you know you're you're the guys understand the mo
[43:48.720 --> 43:52.640]  not that we're perfect i mean it's sick i mean we're the best there is and and
[43:52.640 --> 43:56.080]  we're not even that good but i mean you do a great job my
[43:56.080 --> 43:58.800]  point is is that there's so much more we should be doing
[43:58.800 --> 44:02.880]  when we need to give them the history of it paul where mohammed adah and four
[44:02.880 --> 44:06.320]  other hijackers went to a malaysian terror summit
[44:06.320 --> 44:11.440]  and when they came back springman the head of the jeta visa bureau for the
[44:11.440 --> 44:15.600]  state department said they're on a terror index and the cia called up and
[44:15.600 --> 44:19.680]  said let him in uh
[44:19.680 --> 44:23.840]  they're really cia agents the terror designation is their cover
[44:23.840 --> 44:27.600]  and i mean we interviewed springman he's in the film fabled enemies that i
[44:27.600 --> 44:30.960]  produced that's available at info wars dot com
[44:30.960 --> 44:34.880]  i interviewed him here on the radio just google alex jones springman
[44:34.880 --> 44:38.080]  and you can find the articles about that i mean i mean the point is it's
[44:38.080 --> 44:41.680]  always the same don't listeners understand
[44:41.680 --> 44:46.640]  that mohammed adah and other hijackers were trained at u.s military bases
[44:46.640 --> 44:50.640]  in high-level spy training confirmed don't people
[44:50.640 --> 44:55.360]  understand it's always the same paul i'm sorry look i'm
[44:55.360 --> 44:58.240]  i got you on to go with the facts here because you're good at presenting them
[44:58.240 --> 45:01.200]  go back to how the ap and others are saying
[45:01.200 --> 45:04.400]  well i mean i've got this bbc report where they say you can't
[45:04.400 --> 45:07.920]  have your hands in your lap you can't have a blanket now
[45:07.920 --> 45:13.520]  no one were i mean that is in a supermax prison you get to have a blanket paul
[45:13.520 --> 45:18.640]  well even uh if you become ill which people do on planes because the food
[45:18.640 --> 45:22.480]  terrible like commanded yesterday the nigerian he
[45:22.480 --> 45:25.920]  he got early went to the toilet he was in there for a long time
[45:25.920 --> 45:30.960]  boom it's the joint terrorism task force investigation the fb is in on it
[45:30.960 --> 45:35.520]  um obama's notified that this man has been in the toilet for a while
[45:35.520 --> 45:39.440]  and of course it all turns out to be absolutely nothing it illustrates the
[45:39.440 --> 45:42.960]  absolute paranoia um and all these orders that were now
[45:42.960 --> 45:47.680]  being made to obey as as a result of it but it's just like the um
[45:47.680 --> 45:52.000]  liquid bombing plot in 2006 which of course was the entree for all these
[45:52.000 --> 45:56.480]  ridiculous measures on how how much liquid you can take through security
[45:56.480 --> 46:00.800]  when you can then just go and buy it it's all about harassing it's all about
[46:00.800 --> 46:04.640]  seeing what the ignorant scum slaves will put up with
[46:04.640 --> 46:09.440]  yeah but in that case the bombers didn't have passports they didn't have flight
[46:09.440 --> 46:13.520]  tickets mi5 had been tracking them for months beforehand
[46:13.520 --> 46:17.040]  and it was only as a result of a miscommunication between the u.s and
[46:17.040 --> 46:20.720]  the uk that the whole story was blown wide open before they
[46:20.720 --> 46:25.120]  boarded the plane that let me stop you again let me stop you again
[46:25.120 --> 46:28.480]  again they don't have passports anything because they're always brought
[46:28.480 --> 46:33.760]  directly on by security let me tell the tsa if you're not
[46:33.760 --> 46:37.120]  part of the terrorist and the average tsa person's you make it 15 bucks an
[46:37.120 --> 46:42.320]  hour has no idea what's going on okay if you see security leading a muslim
[46:42.320 --> 46:46.480]  through to get on the plane go search him they got a bomb
[46:46.480 --> 46:50.480]  i'm sorry paul go ahead yeah so i mean
[46:50.480 --> 46:54.000]  mi5 were tracking these guys for months and uh
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.360]  they knew the exact date of when they planned to do it
[46:57.360 --> 47:01.040]  and that they were about to let them on the plane there was a miscommunication
[47:01.040 --> 47:06.080]  between the u.s if the story got blown wide open and they didn't get on the
[47:06.080 --> 47:08.320]  plane that one was supposed to go ahead
[47:08.320 --> 47:11.600]  but even as a result of just the scare alone of course
[47:11.600 --> 47:14.960]  three or four years later we've still got these ridiculous measures
[47:14.960 --> 47:18.240]  you know which how much will obey to what ridiculous
[47:18.240 --> 47:22.000]  fast level will obey and that's only being ramped up now
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.120]  as a result of this latest one as you said you've got to sit down for the
[47:25.120 --> 47:28.960]  fire what they did is they recruit this will be the mo and finally all comes
[47:28.960 --> 47:33.520]  out just like we said a year ago and now here it is london telegraph front page
[47:33.520 --> 47:37.920]  mumbai suspect is u.s double agent
[47:39.280 --> 47:42.480]  an american man charged with plotting the attacks in mumbai was a double agent
[47:42.480 --> 47:45.440]  for both the united states and al-qaeda terror group
[47:45.440 --> 47:48.720]  that's how they always cover it when it comes out that they're u.s agents oh
[47:48.720 --> 47:52.640]  well he was a double agent uh no it was a globalist agent
[47:52.640 --> 47:57.840]  now i think it's safe to say that this is clearly staged
[47:57.840 --> 48:02.960]  now that you have the guy on board videotaping and the entire flight in
[48:02.960 --> 48:06.480]  front of everyone in the sturdice is leaving him alone to videotaping
[48:06.480 --> 48:11.120]  paul it's always the same mo and we know that
[48:11.120 --> 48:13.920]  this is what happened they recruited the amount of college and said we need you
[48:13.920 --> 48:17.280]  to watch muslim extremists we want you to talk about how you're going to stage
[48:17.280 --> 48:21.360]  terror attacks in class we want you to talk about how
[48:21.360 --> 48:24.880]  you love al-qaeda in the taliban to flush out terrorists your dad's a very
[48:24.880 --> 48:28.160]  powerful person one of the top bankers works with us
[48:28.160 --> 48:33.280]  are you willing to do this for us yes i i want to fight al-qaeda
[48:33.280 --> 48:37.120]  okay and then here he is an agent two years later been all over the world
[48:37.120 --> 48:40.160]  working for these people and they and they said we need to test getting a
[48:40.160 --> 48:43.600]  bomb on a plane to see if sturdice has noticed that you made a liquid bomb
[48:43.600 --> 48:46.480]  inside the urinal now we understand and again how
[48:46.480 --> 48:50.720]  many times is the batf and others been caught sneaking fake bombs on
[48:50.720 --> 48:53.440]  and see when they get caught they say oh it's just a drill
[48:53.440 --> 48:56.400]  watson we know how they did this he's led on the plane
[48:56.400 --> 48:59.760]  without the passport he's got the handler on board to make him go through
[48:59.760 --> 49:02.640]  with it with the video camera saying look i'm here with the camera
[49:02.640 --> 49:06.160]  it's just a drill i mean it's so obvious watson
[49:06.160 --> 49:11.360]  we have them don't we it's it's blatant it's transparent
[49:11.360 --> 49:14.480]  and now you got joe Lieberman saying we need to attack yemen
[49:14.480 --> 49:17.680]  and surprise surprise they're now connecting it to yemen and saying that
[49:17.680 --> 49:22.080]  now that's the home of al-qaeda after afghanistan now they're all in yemen i
[49:22.080 --> 49:26.800]  guess we need to small bomb yemen don't we
[49:26.800 --> 49:30.640]  there's really no end to this watson there there literally is no end well
[49:30.640 --> 49:33.760]  there's a lot of other points i'll go over later on this but
[49:33.760 --> 49:38.160]  we need really strong headlines with just data boil downs
[49:38.160 --> 49:42.400]  that 99 chances is completely staged it follows the
[49:42.400 --> 49:48.800]  the past mo and i i mean write the article if you agree with me i mean
[49:48.800 --> 49:53.040]  this is authoritative isn't it yeah um
[49:53.040 --> 49:56.560]  every single plot that we've tracked has led back to where
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.480]  these terrorists being handled by people in u.s intelligence i mean there's no
[50:00.480 --> 50:06.240]  major plot that hasn't led back to that they're always led onto the airplanes
[50:06.240 --> 50:09.680]  they never have to have passports they're always trained at military bases
[50:09.680 --> 50:13.760]  with high-level spy clearances oh but if you're you know a
[50:13.760 --> 50:17.280]  family or grandma or whatever then you're going to get harassed maybe the best
[50:17.280 --> 50:20.480]  way to get through airport security is just to have a handler
[50:20.480 --> 50:24.320]  um some explosives no passport and then you'll breeze right through well that's
[50:24.320 --> 50:27.440]  the start if you're coming out of a muslim country with
[50:27.440 --> 50:31.760]  explosives as long as as interpol walks you through
[50:31.760 --> 50:35.120]  then it's fine yeah watson can you believe interpol is going to be able to
[50:35.120 --> 50:39.040]  operate in the u.s with total immunity
[50:39.040 --> 50:43.280]  well know that the harmonization of law enforcement is one of the
[50:43.280 --> 50:46.400]  key goals of world government so it's no surprise
[50:46.400 --> 50:49.920]  they've been doing it for decades through the eschewan system
[50:49.920 --> 50:54.960]  with the spying chandeliers in every country well good job over at prison

[52:13.840 --> 52:17.040]  americans at home. I have a tremendous influence
[52:17.040 --> 52:21.440]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots. I think
[52:21.440 --> 52:25.680]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay
[52:25.680 --> 52:28.320]  attention. For the republic identifies the
[52:28.320 --> 52:31.760]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[52:31.760 --> 52:35.920]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[52:35.920 --> 52:38.800]  government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke and arsonists
[52:38.800 --> 52:42.080]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the
[52:42.080 --> 52:44.880]  checkout to? Today it seems like nobody does care
[52:44.880 --> 52:48.400]  and right now in washington dc we have seen

[54:09.680 --> 54:14.160]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio
[54:14.160 --> 54:18.160]  you see the way tyranny works is that it
[54:18.160 --> 54:22.960]  carries out thousands of little insults to freedom
[54:22.960 --> 54:28.080]  and it slowly sets the precedent that the government is god the police are god
[54:28.080 --> 54:31.360]  the system can't be questioned and when they set up the national
[54:31.360 --> 54:35.040]  security dictatorship in 1947 that was the beginning of the end.
[54:35.040 --> 54:38.880]  Imagine the CIA and other agencies could operate with unlimited funds
[54:38.880 --> 54:42.480]  in secret. What would happen if you told your
[54:42.480 --> 54:46.880]  employees let's say you owned a
[54:46.880 --> 54:50.640]  restaurant and you told your employees and your managers
[54:50.640 --> 54:53.840]  oh you can operate in secret and do whatever you want there'll be no oversight
[54:53.840 --> 54:57.680]  and you have total immunity they'd rob you blind
[54:57.680 --> 55:01.200]  and we've been robbed and now they're staged in terror attacks to
[55:01.200 --> 55:08.560]  set up the police state in every stinking time
[55:08.560 --> 55:12.320]  they walk the person on the plane they protect them the person thinks they're
[55:12.320 --> 55:16.320]  part of a drill remember the james woods clip when
[55:16.320 --> 55:18.560]  he went on fox and talked about a week before 9-11
[55:18.560 --> 55:22.160]  Muhammad Atta and four other guys are on the plane doing drills for hijacking
[55:22.160 --> 55:24.720]  the plane he gets off the airplane tells the
[55:24.720 --> 55:28.560]  FBI they come to him and say well you need to keep your mouth shut
[55:28.560 --> 55:31.120]  about this
[55:31.920 --> 55:36.160]  then after 9-11 they show up at his house
[55:36.560 --> 55:39.360]  the FBI does
[55:40.080 --> 55:44.240]  you understand it's in the Associated Press and in Newsweek but they just
[55:44.240 --> 55:48.560]  report it like it's no big deal yeah Muhammad Atta and others were trained in
[55:48.560 --> 55:52.320]  spy training at US bases and this colonel who's the
[55:52.320 --> 55:55.680]  head of the base he says the government's involved in the attacks
[55:55.680 --> 55:59.440]  because these guys were US government agents something's going on
[55:59.440 --> 56:04.320]  how dare the colonel question
[56:07.680 --> 56:10.960]  I have interviewed the head of the US embassy
[56:10.960 --> 56:15.280]  who wouldn't let Atta and others in and was ordered to let him in and told
[56:15.280 --> 56:21.840]  their CIA their terror designation is a cover
[56:21.840 --> 56:25.760]  now what exactly happened on 9-11 I don't know
[56:25.760 --> 56:30.320]  but I don't one thing intelligence had its fingerprints all over it
[56:30.320 --> 56:33.760]  and they sure had the motive to take our liberties and freedoms and launch all
[56:33.760 --> 56:35.840]  these wars just like Dick Cheney wrote in the
[56:35.840 --> 56:40.240]  September 20th 2000 PNAC document rebuilding America's defenses
[56:40.240 --> 56:44.480]  facts are facts
[56:45.680 --> 56:49.520]  and none of us are safe while this continues if these guys could get away
[56:49.520 --> 56:52.720]  with 9-11 of course they're going to get away with stealing your pension funds
[56:52.720 --> 56:57.120]  blind of course they're going to get away with saying
[56:57.120 --> 57:02.480]  interpol is above the law can do whatever it wants in the United States
[57:02.480 --> 57:06.320]  all right here's the deal I haven't even gotten into health care
[57:06.320 --> 57:09.760]  notice this is also a great diversion from health care so people don't actually
[57:09.760 --> 57:13.600]  look every day that passes more people turn against
[57:13.600 --> 57:16.960]  government-run health care as they read the bill but now as it goes into
[57:16.960 --> 57:19.840]  conference committee between the house and senate nobody's talking about
[57:19.840 --> 57:22.320]  health care now because everyone's hyperventilating and
[57:22.320 --> 57:25.040]  the president's being woken up from naps sir
[57:25.040 --> 57:27.920]  someone was in a bathroom for 20 minutes
[57:31.920 --> 57:34.880]  America in the world is on the edge of collapse
[57:34.880 --> 57:39.120]  everyone is in fear everyone is a prisoner because somebody set off a
[57:39.120 --> 57:44.320]  firecracker on an airplane but no one discusses why he was
[57:44.320 --> 57:48.160]  led onto the plane by security no one asked why someone was there
[57:48.160 --> 57:50.880]  videotaping him the entire time in front of everyone
[57:50.880 --> 57:54.000]  in full view that was to make the stupid patsy
[57:54.000 --> 57:57.600]  feel safe okay i'm being filmed okay it's a drill
[57:57.600 --> 58:03.280]  okay and then the guy was stunned when it went off
[58:04.560 --> 58:09.920]  same thing with mcvey mcvey they're sworn federal affidavits now
[58:09.920 --> 58:14.000]  in court record that mcvey told his lawyers look i was deep intel
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.160]  i was hired infiltrate militias i was set up
[58:18.160 --> 58:21.600]  and see mcvey didn't want to bomb the daycare center
[58:21.600 --> 58:24.480]  it's kind of like tony montana and scarface didn't want to blow up the car
[58:24.480 --> 58:28.000]  with little kids in it and so they believe that's why he was chosen as the
[58:28.000 --> 58:31.760]  patsy because two weeks before he threw a fit and said i'm not taking part in
[58:31.760 --> 58:36.880]  blowing up a daycare center that's the feds folks
[58:36.880 --> 58:40.320]  we'll be right back stay with us

[1:01:47.920 --> 1:01:53.200]  with house slaves you name it in the u.s and nothing's done to them
[1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:56.560]  and nobody prosecutes them i'm gonna explain how this criminal network

[1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:19.120]  it really is mind-blowing though how openly
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:23.120]  obvious i mean there's no other way for a thinking person
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:27.840]  who has one micron of intelligence to be able to
[1:02:27.840 --> 1:02:31.040]  look at this latest
[1:02:32.160 --> 1:02:35.120]  underwear bomber
[1:02:35.760 --> 1:02:40.640]  syringe bomber who that's got a scary sounding name
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:44.400]  there's no way to look at this and not know the only thing it can be is
[1:02:44.400 --> 1:02:48.480]  government he's led by some security person in a suit
[1:02:48.480 --> 1:02:53.520]  passed all the security and put on board the aircraft and then someone sits
[1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:55.680]  there in plain view from start to finish
[1:02:55.680 --> 1:03:01.840]  videotaping him the entire flight we put a call into the lawyer is one of the
[1:03:01.840 --> 1:03:04.080]  witnesses of this who's talked to the news
[1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:06.960]  trying to get him on in fact jaren just keep calling him
[1:03:06.960 --> 1:03:10.640]  squeaky wheel will get the grease
[1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:18.320]  just when does it end when does the corruption
[1:03:18.320 --> 1:03:23.760]  end when does this open criminal government end when does it stop
[1:03:24.480 --> 1:03:31.680]  it stops when the people realize there's no polishing you know what
[1:03:31.680 --> 1:03:36.800]  there's no putting perfume on a pig you can put lipstick on a pig it's still a
[1:03:36.800 --> 1:03:41.360]  pig if your house burns down you can't go
[1:03:41.360 --> 1:03:45.280]  wallowing around in the ashes and make believe that your house is still there
[1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:47.920]  ladies and gentlemen our government is illegitimate the
[1:03:47.920 --> 1:03:51.920]  in planetary government is a corporate government designed to loot and steal
[1:03:51.920 --> 1:03:55.440]  the globalists are a bunch of inbred ruthless people that see us as lower
[1:03:55.440 --> 1:03:59.760]  than animals who compete with each other over who
[1:03:59.760 --> 1:04:03.360]  can be the most psychopathic and ruthless and they've got fancy
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:09.120]  pr firms putting out high-tech propaganda to brainwash the public
[1:04:09.120 --> 1:04:12.560]  but we don't just have the evil elite we have a decadent
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:20.080]  dumbed down entitled mass of cowards and scum that make up the general public
[1:04:20.080 --> 1:04:24.480]  ninnies who think corruption is cute and think that anyone warning them about
[1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:28.720]  corruption is is funny and they have no idea
[1:04:28.720 --> 1:04:32.000]  what's happening to them now in the middle is maybe 20 30 percent of the
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:34.960]  population who are good hard-working decent smart
[1:04:34.960 --> 1:04:39.120]  connected to god people who understand and have discernment
[1:04:39.120 --> 1:04:43.120]  and we are the enemy we are the enemy of the of the cattle
[1:04:43.120 --> 1:04:46.560]  and we are the enemy of the wolves
[1:04:49.120 --> 1:04:52.960]  the cowardly population makes war against anything good and decent because

[1:05:22.800 --> 1:05:25.440]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded

[1:12:36.800 --> 1:12:42.320]  saw the inner poll article and then went and read the executive order
[1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:47.760]  i'm not even angry anymore i'm more just sad this is so humiliating it's so
[1:12:47.760 --> 1:12:50.560]  unconstitutional
[1:12:52.400 --> 1:12:58.160]  and when i saw the underwear bomber and how this was staged i i was like it

[1:13:02.080 --> 1:13:05.920]  i'm not afraid of some lone nut trying to go on an airplane and blow
[1:13:05.920 --> 1:13:09.600]  themselves up statistically i got a better chance of drowning or being
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:13.200]  struck by lightning but man to know the government

[1:13:24.800 --> 1:13:28.640]  ally themselves with the corporate system and the lies and who attack us and

[1:15:18.320 --> 1:15:21.840]  let's roll two from national review mark stein's
[1:15:21.840 --> 1:15:27.520]  national review blog where he makes fun of charlie sheen and ties him in with the
[1:15:27.520 --> 1:15:31.520]  underwear bomber it says uh this time the last line of
[1:15:31.520 --> 1:15:34.800]  defense worked talking about how citizens stood up and took action
[1:15:34.800 --> 1:15:38.240]  which is true though the flight attendant screamed and
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:42.640]  yelled and said sit down sit down sit down
[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:47.120]  next time the paradise seeking jihadists might get lucky and find
[1:15:47.120 --> 1:15:49.680]  themselves sitting next to say charlie sheen
[1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:54.320]  too immersed in a lengthy treatise on how 9-11 was an inside job
[1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:58.960]  to notice the smoldering socks in the next seat
[1:15:58.960 --> 1:16:03.440]  or to the same kind of nothing to see here crowd
[1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:09.440]  who thought major hasan's emails were consistent with research interest so
[1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:13.680]  what does that tell you about mr stein yeah i can i can see what you're saying
[1:16:13.680 --> 1:16:18.480]  there he was being sarcastic but but but listen brad i appreciate your call
[1:16:18.480 --> 1:16:23.040]  all right i i appreciate it no i i understand
[1:16:23.040 --> 1:16:25.680]  good to hear from you though i'm glad you called i'm glad i could fill you in
[1:16:25.680 --> 1:16:29.120]  on that it was it was sarcasm
[1:16:29.120 --> 1:16:34.240]  but see these guys are so delusional well they're not really delusional
[1:16:34.240 --> 1:16:38.080]  when lembaugh gets up there and says there is no world government there is no
[1:16:38.080 --> 1:16:42.560]  plan for a planetary government or when shon hannity says ron paul
[1:16:42.560 --> 1:16:48.080]  supporters are dangerous cooks there is no world government
[1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:53.360]  when they do that they know full well hundreds of news articles a day announce
[1:16:53.360 --> 1:16:57.920]  world government and a private banking system to run it
[1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:01.040]  but they have such a low view of their listeners
[1:17:01.040 --> 1:17:04.960]  that they're saying to their listeners it's not kosher
[1:17:04.960 --> 1:17:09.600]  it's not acceptable it's not palatable
[1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:17.120]  to pass gas and church or to talk about new world order
[1:17:17.120 --> 1:17:22.400]  so they're there telling you you're a cook i mean what does christ matthews do
[1:17:22.400 --> 1:17:26.240]  when he says if you don't like big government you don't like black
[1:17:26.240 --> 1:17:29.600]  people you if you say socialism that means you're a
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:33.520]  cross burner i mean these are quotes
[1:17:33.520 --> 1:17:38.240]  they are the real racist injecting race to divide and
[1:17:38.240 --> 1:17:42.480]  conquer and control and they have such a low view of their audience
[1:17:42.480 --> 1:17:46.000]  they're saying it's politically incorrect to criticize
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:50.160]  sol alinsky openly saying you wanted to put you in reeducation camps
[1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:54.880]  and being hillary clinton and rock obama's mentor
[1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:02.000]  you are not allowed to say you don't want the government put you in jail for
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:06.080]  five years if you don't get insurance
[1:18:06.960 --> 1:18:11.520]  you're a racist what does the adl say oh you don't like the federal reserve
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:15.920]  robin you you're a racist and they inject the issue
[1:18:15.920 --> 1:18:21.840]  they inject it just like the fbi has been caught scores of times
[1:18:21.840 --> 1:18:25.680]  running all the major white supremacist groups who want to radicalize the
[1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:30.640]  discussion and make any patriotic discussion so anti-semitic and so
[1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:33.600]  cartoonish with black jack moots and shaved heads
[1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:37.360]  and drunks going seek aisle that mainline people
[1:18:37.360 --> 1:18:40.800]  never come into the fight against the new world order because the feds and the
[1:18:40.800 --> 1:18:45.200]  adl went around dropping rat droppings into the
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:49.120]  mix it's like one rat dropping in a bowl of
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:52.240]  spaghetti ruins it
[1:18:54.080 --> 1:18:57.600]  they put rat droppings in it
[1:18:57.600 --> 1:19:01.360]  and a lot of gullible idiots buy into it and get tracked and traced and controlled
[1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:07.840]  by it not me i see through all of it
[1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:14.080]  as for charlie sheen it's in the news that his wife says that she was
[1:19:14.080 --> 1:19:18.400]  completely drunk and the police did test her blood and that was the case
[1:19:18.400 --> 1:19:23.520]  and that he did not assault her oh he's been charged with assaulting her didn't
[1:19:23.520 --> 1:19:29.360]  touch her
[1:19:29.360 --> 1:19:33.120]  and so that's how this works
[1:19:33.120 --> 1:19:36.160]  that's how this works
[1:19:39.760 --> 1:19:46.240]  i know charlie sheen very very well and there's all these people out there who
[1:19:46.240 --> 1:19:51.200]  will get off on hating him hey hating charlie sheen isn't going to get you

[1:22:25.920 --> 1:22:29.120]  experienced this is not only a transfer of power to an
[1:22:29.120 --> 1:22:32.640]  institution that is not accountable to our elected government but has also

[1:24:18.400 --> 1:24:22.560]  looks like on the surface that's bad enough
[1:24:22.560 --> 1:24:27.200]  you see then our police get immunity by becoming international
[1:24:27.200 --> 1:24:30.080]  that's the big dirty secret i'm going to break it down coming up
[1:24:30.080 --> 1:24:34.160]  steven oklahoma you're on the air go ahead
[1:24:36.080 --> 1:24:39.760]  hey steve i hear you with the telephone there how you doing hey hey alex how you

[1:24:42.880 --> 1:24:47.040]  chance to get in hey um i got just a couple of comments
[1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:50.480]  and first i guess about ron paul i was involved in some of
[1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:55.520]  you know delegate as uh in the state uh republican convention
[1:24:55.520 --> 1:24:59.920]  you mentioned ron paul and they immediately start talking about
[1:24:59.920 --> 1:25:04.080]  um what a nutty is and how anybody who supports him is a nut
[1:25:04.080 --> 1:25:06.880]  and i'm sitting there going oh hey i like the guy you know but that's not
[1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:10.320]  working anymore see all they try to do is use peer pressure
[1:25:10.320 --> 1:25:14.240]  to make you feel like you're alone oh he doesn't want the government to grow
[1:25:14.240 --> 1:25:18.720]  anymore and for us to become bankrupt what a cook he doesn't drink big goblets
[1:25:18.720 --> 1:25:24.320]  of cyanide what a weirdo he doesn't play in traffic what a crazy man
[1:25:24.320 --> 1:25:29.120]  he doesn't swim with sharks what a loon he doesn't cut himself and jump into a
[1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:32.880]  pool of piranhas what a weirdo he doesn't shoot
[1:25:32.880 --> 1:25:36.400]  himself in the head with a shotgun what a nutcase
[1:25:36.400 --> 1:25:41.840]  he doesn't love being a slave uh but you understand they're cold bloodedly
[1:25:41.840 --> 1:25:45.360]  doing that they are into the manipulation if it's higher
[1:25:45.360 --> 1:25:49.520]  level party people go ahead oh well it was it was basically it was a
[1:25:49.520 --> 1:25:54.640]  precinct chairs on up yeah you get look you get a lot of smart people don't
[1:25:54.640 --> 1:25:58.560]  decide to work for the good guys most smart people say
[1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:06.400]  i'm gonna go take advantage of sheep and so that's why our society is burning
[1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:10.000]  exactly i'm sorry go ahead i didn't have one other question though
[1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:13.280]  and that is if these guys who are being set up
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:17.520]  you know in these uh saying hey you work for us uh this is just a little
[1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:20.720]  dry run if they keep getting burned like this how are they going to keep finding
[1:26:20.720 --> 1:26:25.120]  people to do this a lot of times that's why they find low grade morons
[1:26:25.120 --> 1:26:28.000]  that's why they find really gullible stupid people
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:31.920]  and they've got thousands of drills going on any one week
[1:26:31.920 --> 1:26:35.600]  i mean there's drills everywhere and so all it takes is first they get these
[1:26:35.600 --> 1:26:39.680]  guys recruited they take them to lots of other drills public drills
[1:26:39.680 --> 1:26:43.440]  and then that's why a lot of times it comes out that hey this guy this terrorist
[1:26:43.440 --> 1:26:49.040]  took part in previous drills and then finally they just set them up
[1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:53.440]  most people grovel to authority i mean you're some young muslim from a rich
[1:26:53.440 --> 1:26:57.200]  family you get recruited to spy on other
[1:26:57.200 --> 1:27:01.920]  people at your college you get taken care of you get paid to do it
[1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:06.800]  and and and then you you get led through security
[1:27:06.800 --> 1:27:11.040]  but i mean the average part that's why it's so important we get this story out
[1:27:11.040 --> 1:27:15.600]  so that patsy's become aware of this well one last comment i'll make and then
[1:27:15.600 --> 1:27:19.760]  i'll i'll get off and that is that i work for a major defense contractor for
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:22.960]  four or five years in their surveillance and intelligence
[1:27:22.960 --> 1:27:28.000]  group and all i can say is that uh there's an awful lot of nepotism in there
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:31.520]  i mean it doesn't matter who you know or what you are or what you know it's who
[1:27:31.520 --> 1:27:35.360]  you know and whose son you are or whose daughter you are or you know
[1:27:35.360 --> 1:27:38.400]  whatever and i mean you can get in and they'll
[1:27:38.400 --> 1:27:42.720]  they'll promote you i mean it's a private imperium for all the contractors
[1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:48.080]  all the congressmen all the big wigs and the airport scanners the face scanning
[1:27:48.080 --> 1:27:51.520]  cameras the entire grid is all the military industrial
[1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:57.440]  complex eating what's left of america i agree i saw stuff every
[1:27:57.440 --> 1:28:01.280]  day that make your next curl that most people don't find out until a year later
[1:28:01.280 --> 1:28:04.800]  well steve as you know i saw the numbers two days ago as you know the defense
[1:28:04.800 --> 1:28:10.320]  department's budget is now bigger than all 50 states budgets together every year
[1:28:10.320 --> 1:28:15.760]  i'm not surprised and why stop there soon i mean you know i mean obama has
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:18.240]  spent more money than all presidents before him
[1:28:18.240 --> 1:28:21.360]  combined why not i mean the i mean the public
[1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:27.120]  is wanting to be abused why not abuse them well it's only gonna last so long
[1:28:27.120 --> 1:28:30.560]  then the you know the house of cards it's gotta fall
[1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:35.200]  i agree but then they plan on it imploding into a really hardcore police state
[1:28:35.200 --> 1:28:38.880]  and that's when it really gets bad i mean folks think when it implodes
[1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:42.960]  everything's gonna get better oh no the yuppie next door to you
[1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:46.320]  will rat you out even if you haven't done anything just to get
[1:28:46.320 --> 1:28:50.320]  a loaf of bread and the government doesn't care if you're innocent
[1:28:50.320 --> 1:28:53.760]  they just want numbers to fill their prisons that's how it worked in the
[1:28:53.760 --> 1:28:57.120]  soviet union i mean have you read what schultz and eason wrote
[1:28:57.120 --> 1:29:01.600]  steve no i haven't i i've i've read excerpts from it so i've heard a lot of
[1:29:01.600 --> 1:29:05.440]  stuff of what he's written but not completely well what kind of stuff did
[1:29:05.440 --> 1:29:07.200]  you see the stuff like with halliburton with a
[1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:11.040]  15 million dollar ten dollar tarp or
[1:29:11.040 --> 1:29:15.200]  well you know no i mean as far as intelligence is concerned that's
[1:29:15.200 --> 1:29:19.120]  i just saw people you know getting promoted who didn't deserve to be
[1:29:19.120 --> 1:29:23.280]  promoted only because their father had a high-ranking position in the company
[1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:26.960]  and that is the only thing that is the only thing that may save us steve
[1:29:26.960 --> 1:29:33.360]  stay there i'm gonna hold you over is that the system is so full of lazy pieces
[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:37.680]  of garbage i mean you think some congressman's grandson
[1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:40.720]  who's got a high-level position in a security company you think he's gonna
[1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:43.920]  be working around the clock no he's gonna be playing golf
[1:29:43.920 --> 1:29:47.840]  visiting hookers and getting drunk and that's why we can beat these people
[1:29:47.840 --> 1:29:51.680]  is because we're the patriots

[1:31:04.240 --> 1:31:08.240]  power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:11.680]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[1:31:11.680 --> 1:31:15.280]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[1:31:15.280 --> 1:31:19.520]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:31:19.520 --> 1:31:23.120]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[1:31:23.120 --> 1:31:27.600]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[1:31:27.600 --> 1:31:31.440]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[1:31:31.440 --> 1:31:34.640]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[1:31:34.640 --> 1:31:38.560]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:42.400]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in
[1:31:42.400 --> 1:31:45.760]  the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest

[1:32:02.400 --> 1:32:06.400]  hi folks this is alex jones i want to tell you about the silver lungs generator
[1:32:06.400 --> 1:32:10.720]  now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution
[1:32:10.720 --> 1:32:15.200]  directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs
[1:32:15.200 --> 1:32:18.640]  the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens
[1:32:18.640 --> 1:32:22.000]  and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:26.240]  respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions
[1:32:26.240 --> 1:32:29.360]  and also delivers the silver nano particles
[1:32:29.360 --> 1:32:33.360]  instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening the
[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:37.200]  sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure
[1:32:37.200 --> 1:32:40.880]  and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator

[1:33:07.280 --> 1:33:10.880]  i know i'm just desperately ranting more and more on this show just what do you
[1:33:10.880 --> 1:33:16.000]  do inner pole complete diplomatic community i mean
[1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:20.720]  that is just outrageous wait until i break it down
[1:33:20.720 --> 1:33:23.680]  going back to steve okay i'm trying to shut up for a minute or two steve so you
[1:33:23.680 --> 1:33:27.520]  can make your point about the defense contractors and
[1:33:27.520 --> 1:33:31.600]  all the nepotism that goes on i mean right here in texas
[1:33:31.600 --> 1:33:35.600]  every major public utility every public private partnership
[1:33:35.600 --> 1:33:39.680]  everyone i know of is openly run by nepotism
[1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:44.400]  open corruption they all have their private SWAT teams beating people up
[1:33:44.400 --> 1:33:49.760]  i mean america is a joke folks once you lose the bill of rights
[1:33:49.760 --> 1:33:53.200]  everything goes to hell in a hand basket and you become just like mexico or
[1:33:53.200 --> 1:33:57.040]  north korea i don't understand why people can't
[1:33:57.040 --> 1:34:01.520]  get that i just can't believe i love this
[1:34:01.520 --> 1:34:05.760]  country so much and i can't believe we're allowing this to happen
[1:34:05.760 --> 1:34:12.320]  i mean i think about the health care bill i can't believe it's this bad
[1:34:12.320 --> 1:34:16.160]  i'm gonna shut up i want to go to your calls steve finish your point
[1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:20.800]  well my point was is just that the you know the defense industry
[1:34:20.800 --> 1:34:24.080]  when i first got into it i thought it was going to be pretty neat
[1:34:24.080 --> 1:34:28.240]  unfortunately and parts of it were just with some of the technology that was
[1:34:28.240 --> 1:34:34.640]  being used but the the way it was run and the waste and i mean i was on
[1:34:34.640 --> 1:34:38.320]  projects that wasted hundreds of millions of dollars
[1:34:38.320 --> 1:34:41.680]  and finally the government would decide well you know we need to just shield
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:43.600]  that and figure out what we're going to do
[1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:46.560]  and then you figure out how else are going to go spend the money
[1:34:46.560 --> 1:34:50.960]  um you know nobody really got in trouble for all the waste
[1:34:50.960 --> 1:34:54.480]  um you know they just had to well we'll just we'll just move it along and try
[1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:58.400]  something else well the government is so corrupt and again
[1:34:58.400 --> 1:35:01.760]  the government's going to run the environmental policies the soviets would
[1:35:01.760 --> 1:35:07.840]  dump reactors in their own freshwater lakes have you ever googled the maps
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:11.120]  of chemical and nuclear waste that our own government has dumped
[1:35:11.120 --> 1:35:14.960]  it's the gulf of mexico the atlantic the pacific
[1:35:14.960 --> 1:35:21.200]  i mean the government government doesn't have to take responsibility
[1:35:21.200 --> 1:35:24.320]  and it gets to interface with private corporations
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:29.920]  who get to loot it i mean can't people figure that out
[1:35:29.920 --> 1:35:33.920]  i guess not you know it was amazing to me that you know the company i worked
[1:35:33.920 --> 1:35:37.120]  for i guess i could tell you which one it was it doesn't really matter i guess
[1:35:37.120 --> 1:35:41.440]  but you know they they gave money to both political parties just so they'd have
[1:35:41.440 --> 1:35:44.800]  a foot in the door no matter which way is the door swing
[1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:51.600]  and i know a lot of places do that but i just thought this was strange they all
[1:35:51.600 --> 1:35:54.960]  do it they all do it but when you see them double
[1:35:54.960 --> 1:35:59.040]  or triple or quadruple down on somebody
[1:35:59.040 --> 1:36:03.360]  then you know that person's bad obama got four times the money mccain got and
[1:36:03.360 --> 1:36:07.360]  again i'm not saying vote for mccain or that he would have been any better
[1:36:07.360 --> 1:36:10.720]  the point was obama was the heir apparent
[1:36:10.720 --> 1:36:14.400]  he was the anointed one and just in case
[1:36:14.400 --> 1:36:18.160]  he died in a car wreck or slipped on a banana peel
[1:36:18.160 --> 1:36:23.280]  or got caught with one of his boyfriends just in case they had mccain as the
[1:36:23.280 --> 1:36:27.040]  backup that's all this is i appreciate your call
[1:36:27.040 --> 1:36:33.680]  steve just and of course you know it came out in
[1:36:33.680 --> 1:36:36.240]  major newspapers like the washington post that
[1:36:36.240 --> 1:36:41.040]  bill clinton was being blackmailed by the british and the israelis
[1:36:41.040 --> 1:36:44.160]  and who was the chief of staff
[1:36:44.800 --> 1:36:48.080]  or who was the head person over his itinerary rama manual
[1:36:48.080 --> 1:36:53.200]  who's the chief of staff now rama manual of course obama's blackmailed
[1:36:53.200 --> 1:36:58.400]  that's why he was chosen if you don't have 14 million skeletons in your
[1:36:58.400 --> 1:37:02.240]  closet you don't get put into higher office
[1:37:02.240 --> 1:37:07.200]  mccain had massive skeletons
[1:37:07.920 --> 1:37:14.240]  it's a pack of criminals and i know i keep saying that it's just that
[1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:17.360]  i know you the audience understand that even better than i do but
[1:37:17.360 --> 1:37:21.280]  i i sit there in restaurants or grocery stores
[1:37:21.280 --> 1:37:24.800]  or in my front yard watching neighbors watching people
[1:37:24.800 --> 1:37:28.880]  and they're so childlike they were brought up with everything so
[1:37:28.880 --> 1:37:32.720]  easy they were brought up with everything just hand
[1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:36.160]  fed to them and they believe whatever they're told
[1:37:36.160 --> 1:37:40.560]  i mean if we had a population fully awake we'd have one hell of a fight on our
[1:37:40.560 --> 1:37:47.360]  hands instead we've got a population blissfully unaware
[1:37:47.360 --> 1:37:51.920]  okay back to the calls
[1:37:51.920 --> 1:37:55.200]  curtis in origan you're on the air thanks for holding
[1:37:55.200 --> 1:37:59.600]  thank you alex uh... since flipping through the tv today the fixed corporate
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:03.200]  media lots of uh... fake news about the underwear
[1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:07.200]  terrorists down in our ambitio dampen they have the feeling that the failing
[1:38:07.200 --> 1:38:11.120]  to mention about the cameraman of the guys who was shooting in the
[1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:14.480]  on the plane they're saying that they're talking about his aisle and
[1:38:14.480 --> 1:38:17.920]  how it's a good seat for terrorism
[1:38:17.920 --> 1:38:21.040]  but i was just commenting on that my question is if you could spend more
[1:38:21.040 --> 1:38:24.560]  time in the health care belt in sickle at stay away from this
[1:38:24.560 --> 1:38:28.400]  there's a clip a friend of mine showed me this on facebook max balkas the great
[1:38:28.400 --> 1:38:32.400]  max balkas democrat from uh... drunk ontana drunk
[1:38:32.400 --> 1:38:36.720]  talking about the uh... the health care bill it's quite disgusting if you could
[1:38:36.720 --> 1:38:40.800]  just read the bill maybe just talk about it on the air and get people to
[1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:45.120]  think about it more instead of this underwear bomber that'd be fantastic
[1:38:45.120 --> 1:38:48.080]  that happy new year to you and happy new year to all the the info wars and

[1:38:55.360 --> 1:39:01.840]  one seventeenth to one twentieth
[1:39:01.840 --> 1:39:06.800]  people need to understand correction grabbing seventeen to twenty percent
[1:39:06.800 --> 1:39:12.240]  or roughly one fifth
[1:39:12.240 --> 1:39:16.320]  of the economy is an absolutely key objective of the bankers they need a
[1:39:16.320 --> 1:39:19.760]  new line of credit a new line of derivatives
[1:39:19.760 --> 1:39:27.120]  a new line of your tax money that they can manipulate and use and leverage
[1:39:27.120 --> 1:39:31.200]  and yes we do have the clip of balkas completely drunk there's no doubt about
[1:39:31.200 --> 1:39:35.600]  it just up there completely drunk slurring his words
[1:39:35.600 --> 1:39:41.040]  and shaking his finger at people saying pass the health care bill

[1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:07.760]  everything the cheapest way to do it is to buy blank

[1:42:06.240 --> 1:42:10.960]  this is big money and so you will have at a restaurant
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:14.400]  after the event you'll be there with ten of your friends
[1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:17.920]  having barbecue or whatever and a personal waddle over like they're with
[1:42:17.920 --> 1:42:22.560]  you and say hey how about we kill the mayor
[1:42:22.560 --> 1:42:26.240]  and it's always an informant it's always a cop they have a predatory look in
[1:42:26.240 --> 1:42:30.080]  their eyes a hatred for their fellow man they enjoy evil
[1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:35.520]  they always just look like dirtbags they feel like dirtbags their whole
[1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:39.120]  system their whole demeanor their whole aura
[1:42:39.120 --> 1:42:43.600]  their vibe and you just pull a camera out on them
[1:42:43.600 --> 1:42:47.120]  and say get out of here fed and they're usually so arrogant
[1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:52.880]  they'll have an unmarked but it'll have the black white wall
[1:42:52.880 --> 1:42:56.640]  you know tires they'll even have an unmarked car out in the parking lot
[1:42:56.640 --> 1:43:01.040]  and you just say listen criminal get out of here
[1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:04.880]  look they got unlimited money they're a poison they're a disease poured out
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:08.880]  upon us don't you understand that i've dealt with them i've seen
[1:43:08.880 --> 1:43:13.120]  them i know them i know who they are
[1:43:13.680 --> 1:43:16.960]  you control the government you control everything you can rob everyone
[1:43:16.960 --> 1:43:25.520]  and they are the health care plan funds abortion with taxpayer money
[1:43:25.520 --> 1:43:30.160]  the health care plan puts you in jail for five years
[1:43:31.520 --> 1:43:37.760]  quarter million dollar fine if you don't get insurance
[1:43:40.480 --> 1:43:44.160]  it takes 2.5 to 5 percent out of your paycheck depending on your tax
[1:43:44.160 --> 1:43:47.360]  bracket it allows the insurance companies to
[1:43:47.360 --> 1:43:52.720]  raise insurance prices and it cuts medicare and medicaid
[1:43:52.720 --> 1:43:56.880]  by over 41 billion dollars a year on record it cuts
[1:43:56.880 --> 1:44:00.080]  all the free bc we're at the end of the line now
[1:44:00.080 --> 1:44:03.920]  where the taxes go up and all the goodies go bye bye
[1:44:03.920 --> 1:44:06.720]  anyhow you get to go stand in line and maybe get an aspirin for your heart
[1:44:06.720 --> 1:44:14.080]  attack oh yeah they got free health care in cuba
[1:44:14.080 --> 1:44:17.280]  if you're an inner party member you get good health care if you
[1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:20.960]  if you're just some worker from the country
[1:44:20.960 --> 1:44:24.800]  you get some painkillers just like our troops
[1:44:24.800 --> 1:44:28.640]  troops come home nerve gassed they do autopsies on thousands of dead
[1:44:28.640 --> 1:44:32.800]  congressional hearings in the mid 90s their brain stems are literally
[1:44:32.800 --> 1:44:38.880]  dissolving from nerve gas when the u.s blew up the nerve gas
[1:44:38.880 --> 1:44:42.320]  depots at camicia and you know what they do when
[1:44:42.320 --> 1:44:46.320]  you're dying shriveling up they only use your patriotism when
[1:44:46.320 --> 1:44:50.080]  they wrap their police state in it but when you're actually a marine corps
[1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:53.440]  captain dying in a wheelchair they go you know what you get
[1:44:53.440 --> 1:44:57.280]  mac you get some painkillers and you're lucky you get that
[1:44:57.280 --> 1:45:04.320]  now go die and get in a hole that's how they work
[1:45:04.320 --> 1:45:07.120]  and all of you fools that serve the system you're going to find out what the
[1:45:07.120 --> 1:45:10.320]  system thinks about you remember six months ago when
[1:45:10.320 --> 1:45:14.800]  obama said they were going to make troops pay for their own insurance
[1:45:14.800 --> 1:45:18.160]  pay for their own health care with their own insurance
[1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:23.360]  everybody got up in arms about it so they backed off for now
[1:45:23.360 --> 1:45:27.440]  you see they'll get away with whatever they can
[1:45:27.440 --> 1:45:30.720]  who could they have cut
[1:45:31.840 --> 1:45:36.640]  healthcare and call it liberal obama who could they have launched new wars and
[1:45:36.640 --> 1:45:40.960]  call it liberal obama they had gotten as much gas mileage as they
[1:45:40.960 --> 1:45:45.040]  could out of george w bush and now they put in obama
[1:45:45.040 --> 1:45:49.200]  and his approval ratings dropping like a rock as well record low
[1:45:49.200 --> 1:45:53.280]  his wife's a record low but they don't care they'll have a new right wing puppet
[1:45:53.280 --> 1:45:57.760]  for you in three years and then all the conservatives suddenly won't mind
[1:45:57.760 --> 1:46:02.320]  inner poll being in the u.s. they suddenly won't mind the naked body
[1:46:02.320 --> 1:46:05.440]  scanners in the airports they suddenly won't mind the government
[1:46:05.440 --> 1:46:10.480]  health care because they'll feel like their party wanted least
[1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:14.400]  and they'll say well at least obama isn't in there
[1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:20.240]  well at least bush isn't in there it's this parlor trick
[1:46:20.240 --> 1:46:26.080]  oh it makes me sick mike in illinois you're on the air
[1:46:26.080 --> 1:46:32.080]  uh... yes sir oh yeah man this is crazy man this is funny man

[1:46:35.840 --> 1:46:39.920]  maybe maybe they should you know maybe they did maybe this is what they're
[1:46:39.920 --> 1:46:43.280]  you know maybe this was to get this because i don't know man this is crazy
[1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:47.440]  i don't understand how the americans are so dumb well mike mike
[1:46:47.440 --> 1:46:52.400]  well while it's true that there are a lot of idiots who deserve what's
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:54.800]  happening to them the problem is it's going to happen all of us that are
[1:46:54.800 --> 1:46:59.040]  awake as well we've got to save everybody
[1:46:59.040 --> 1:47:03.520]  first of the jews then you know first of the iraq then it's going to be the black
[1:47:03.520 --> 1:47:07.680]  from mexicans and you know the whites and all of a sudden you know

[1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:33.280]  we don't understand that everything is on by these
[1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:37.440]  uh... iraq bankers the media the
[1:47:37.440 --> 1:47:41.760]  badamata schools everything is on even the uh... it was bought
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:46.560]  through fraud uh... the general uh...
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:50.160]  we said aside that how that how the government said besides the uh...
[1:47:50.160 --> 1:47:54.000]  the farmers so they can actually make a living what's that those controls almost
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:59.040]  every uh... every every food type that that is
[1:47:59.040 --> 1:48:03.040]  processed absolutely they they want us
[1:48:03.040 --> 1:48:07.200]  domesticated they want us dependent on them that's the number one game
[1:48:07.200 --> 1:48:10.800]  and they want us trained to literally be prisoners
[1:48:10.800 --> 1:48:14.320]  in fact queue up that minute and a half bbc report

[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:38.160]  uh... and i'm kind of nervous but anyway i just like to point out the
[1:48:38.160 --> 1:48:41.200]  complete ridiculousness of the obama
[1:48:41.200 --> 1:48:45.440]  and he probably drove by like two or three crowded malls on his way to the
[1:48:45.440 --> 1:48:48.400]  you know airplane with the high seat you know security and
[1:48:48.400 --> 1:48:52.640]  whatever else of the airport and so many other soft easier targets where he
[1:48:52.640 --> 1:48:56.320]  could hurt a lot more people
[1:48:56.320 --> 1:49:00.000]  they only do it to airports so they can have that controlled zone
[1:49:00.000 --> 1:49:04.400]  to jack up more security to train you to then move it to
[1:49:04.400 --> 1:49:09.840]  the off uh... airport sectors go ahead
[1:49:09.840 --> 1:49:12.560]  yeah well i just want to see i'll just you know make that point i was i was
[1:49:12.560 --> 1:49:15.120]  silly and stupid it really it all really is that
[1:49:15.120 --> 1:49:18.640]  there's a guy that could have made it you know made a big impact
[1:49:18.640 --> 1:49:21.760]  have an easier target but they're so stupid they had to go they got to go for
[1:49:21.760 --> 1:49:25.760]  the high security zone that's that's all i'm going to say thank you
[1:49:25.760 --> 1:49:31.680]  i appreciate your call again they do the drills at the high security zones you
[1:49:31.680 --> 1:49:35.920]  know how many drills the navy seals do of attacking their own embassies
[1:49:35.920 --> 1:49:39.440]  you know how many drills the army does of trying to get into their own bases
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:42.640]  you know how many drills the batf and fbi
[1:49:42.640 --> 1:49:47.360]  and cia do of infiltrating airports and that's what they do
[1:49:47.360 --> 1:49:51.520]  they go hire people and tell them it's a drill
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:54.880]  i mean they've been caught doing this over and over again this is not our
[1:49:54.880 --> 1:50:01.040]  opinion and then a sharp dressed man in a suit leads him on to the plane
[1:50:01.040 --> 1:50:05.120]  past security without a passport he gets on and then someone through the entire
[1:50:05.120 --> 1:50:08.240]  flight is videotaping him everybody was wondering
[1:50:08.240 --> 1:50:11.760]  why are they videotaping that guy
[1:50:12.560 --> 1:50:16.640]  and who knows the intel center admittedly run by the cia they may release
[1:50:16.640 --> 1:50:19.680]  a new al-qaeda tape saying oh look al-qaeda got off the plane
[1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:24.080]  this is their victory video you have no idea
[1:50:24.080 --> 1:50:28.400]  it's like major hassan for two years sending emails about how he's planning
[1:50:28.400 --> 1:50:33.440]  all this horrible stuff to what he thought was al-qaeda
[1:50:33.440 --> 1:50:37.600]  and of course it was really to al-ciaida and now congress wants the details of
[1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:41.840]  those emails and they've been told national security you can't have them
[1:50:41.840 --> 1:50:47.200]  yes there are real lunatic muslims that want to attack us
[1:50:47.200 --> 1:50:51.680]  but in every case they're shepherded and protected but in this case it looks like
[1:50:51.680 --> 1:50:56.160]  it's a pure patsy that's the only way the pieces
[1:50:56.160 --> 1:51:01.520]  of the puzzle fit together it's unbelievable

[1:54:38.080 --> 1:54:45.040]  flight 253 situation is serving not just as a distraction to crack down more
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:48.160]  and more security there's never enough at the airports
[1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:51.680]  but it's also being used to distract from the health care debate
[1:54:51.680 --> 1:54:56.240]  while this is in conference committee and they've had two democrats defect in
[1:54:56.240 --> 1:55:00.720]  the last week to the republicans they're leaving the sinking ship
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:06.640]  but once the bank robberies in process in progress you know there
[1:55:06.640 --> 1:55:10.080]  even though they know the cops are on the way they still
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:15.280]  why abandon the armored truck full of full of the cash
[1:55:16.560 --> 1:55:20.720]  why abandon the armored truck full of cash they're not going to
[1:55:20.720 --> 1:55:24.240]  and so they're going to try to ram it through
[1:55:24.240 --> 1:55:28.240]  it may fail though there is a chance
[1:55:28.240 --> 1:55:31.600]  and a lot of this the last two weeks of how it had to pass and couldn't be
[1:55:31.600 --> 1:55:34.160]  stopped a lot of that was a foregone conclusion
[1:55:34.160 --> 1:55:37.200]  where they're just putting it out there that resistance is futile
[1:55:37.200 --> 1:55:45.680]  the borg will absorb you i have a ap list here of what the tsa is saying
[1:55:45.680 --> 1:55:48.320]  the new security will be you can't cover your lap
[1:55:48.320 --> 1:55:51.600]  you can't get up to go to the bathroom in the last hour of flight you can have
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:56.000]  no electronic devices you've got to go through body scanners
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:00.960]  but here is the bbc announcing to all the slaves
[1:56:02.240 --> 1:56:07.520]  why they're being delayed to keep them safe from al ciaida here it is
[1:56:07.520 --> 1:56:13.120]  just from the uk alone there are 100 flights to the united states 100 from
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:17.280]  the united states and 25 000 people traveling in
[1:56:17.280 --> 1:56:20.160]  either direction and of course you can multiply that by
[1:56:20.160 --> 1:56:24.720]  maybe tenfold for other countries flying in and out of the us
[1:56:24.720 --> 1:56:29.120]  and all of those passengers are going to notice a very very different
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:33.280]  attitude at security first of all the amount of hand luggage is restricted to
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:36.160]  one piece and that i understand includes all your
[1:56:36.160 --> 1:56:40.560]  duty-free purchases at the airport therefore is therefore going to be
[1:56:40.560 --> 1:56:44.320]  that's just because the lazies don't want to have to scan and run through all the
[1:56:44.320 --> 1:56:47.120]  bags again they want to train you to be a prisoner
[1:56:47.120 --> 1:56:50.400]  where all your service is cut down to nothing in the name of security
[1:56:50.400 --> 1:56:53.360]  continue with the social engineering
[1:56:53.360 --> 1:56:57.120]  check-in because people will need to sort out check-in extra bags
[1:56:57.120 --> 1:57:00.400]  uh the airlines have said most of them that they will not be making an
[1:57:00.400 --> 1:57:04.080]  additional charge for those bags which is something that goes through the
[1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:07.520]  normal he says the regular security and they put
[1:57:07.520 --> 1:57:12.000]  up on screen a body scanner and of course every body scanner they ever
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:16.640]  show always shows someone with a gun the message is everyone's got a gun
[1:57:16.640 --> 1:57:22.560]  see it's all psychological warfare go continue security check which passengers
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:27.040]  go to wherever their destination is but at the gate if you're flying to or from
[1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:30.480]  the u.s. you will receive a further pat down
[1:57:30.480 --> 1:57:34.480]  search that is designed to identify any
[1:57:34.480 --> 1:57:39.680]  everyone gets a pat down now continues that might be strapped to the body
[1:57:39.680 --> 1:57:43.040]  before you are allowed on board and then once you get on board the last
[1:57:43.040 --> 1:57:47.600]  hour of any flight to the united states everybody is required to be seated
[1:57:47.600 --> 1:57:50.880]  nobody can use the bathrooms and everybody is required to keep their
[1:57:50.880 --> 1:57:54.800]  laps uncovered so you can have blankets or laptops or anything
[1:57:54.800 --> 1:57:58.640]  you just sit there for the last 60 minutes of the flight by the way
[1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:02.800]  if even in a supermax prison you're not put into
[1:58:02.800 --> 1:58:07.920]  restraints when you're in your own jail cell but in the supermax prisons of the
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:13.360]  friendly skies you keep your head forward your hands out of your lap
[1:58:13.360 --> 1:58:17.840]  you submit and it's under patriot act whatever they
[1:58:17.840 --> 1:58:22.240]  say the regulations are go you will see people arrested for this people are
[1:58:22.240 --> 1:58:25.520]  arrested for arguing in charge of the patriot act
[1:58:25.520 --> 1:58:28.720]  and then he just goes on and on i mean come on
[1:58:28.720 --> 1:58:32.480]  oh my gosh somebody might blow up an airplane we all have to be slaves now
[1:58:32.480 --> 1:58:35.520]  someone might blow up a train we have to give up all our rights there
[1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:38.080]  someone attacked a shopping mall we've got to do it there
[1:58:38.080 --> 1:58:41.680]  oh my gosh someone attacked the school everything's a prison
[1:58:41.680 --> 1:58:47.360]  america's number one stories for independent talk radio for over a decade
[1:58:47.360 --> 1:58:52.320]  we are the GCN radio network
[1:58:52.320 --> 1:58:56.320]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[1:58:56.320 --> 1:58:59.520]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[1:58:59.520 --> 1:59:03.520]  is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[1:59:03.520 --> 1:59:06.800]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[1:59:06.800 --> 1:59:10.800]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots
[1:59:10.800 --> 1:59:16.000]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:19.280]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[1:59:19.280 --> 1:59:23.680]  the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[1:59:23.680 --> 1:59:26.960]  and on its ashes constructing world government tim geithner
[1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:30.720]  Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the congress is
[1:59:30.720 --> 1:59:34.560]  saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:38.080]  and right now in washington dc we have seen
[1:59:38.080 --> 1:59:41.920]  a fall of the republic get your copy of full of the republic
[1:59:41.920 --> 1:59:47.040]  on dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super
[1:59:47.040 --> 1:59:51.600]  high quality at prison planet dot tv
[1:59:54.160 --> 2:00:01.200]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:00:06.000 --> 2:00:10.800]  big brother mainstream media government coverups
[2:00:10.800 --> 2:00:18.080]  you want answers well so does he he's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[2:00:18.080 --> 2:00:24.400]  and now live from austin texas alex jones
[2:00:26.960 --> 2:00:31.600]  godfrey bloom joining us coming up in the next segment member of the european
[2:00:31.600 --> 2:00:36.480]  parliament for yorkshire the united kingdom independence party
[2:00:36.480 --> 2:00:40.240]  the last hour i'm going to break down inner pole getting diplomatic community
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:43.760]  in the us and i'm going to recap the latest developments
[2:00:43.760 --> 2:00:48.560]  with the vaunted shoe bomber slash underwear bomber
[2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:52.880]  slash syringe bomber and how completely staged that is
[2:00:52.880 --> 2:00:56.720]  the good news is we exposed the fact that bush was issuing terror alerts for
[2:00:56.720 --> 2:00:59.760]  political purposes and now it's been declassified and
[2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:03.840]  governor rich wrote a book admitting it they had a homeland security that's
[2:01:03.840 --> 2:01:08.240]  pretty authoritative and we're going to expose obama
[2:01:08.240 --> 2:01:11.440]  and the brits and the germans and others for using this as a way to enslave
[2:01:11.440 --> 2:01:15.840]  their people and we exposed the flu shots as a fraud
[2:01:15.840 --> 2:01:18.560]  you know they tried to order forced inoculations
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:23.040]  in new york and boston in massachusetts
[2:01:23.040 --> 2:01:28.480]  that failed and they'll undoubtedly come back and try again i you know i love
[2:01:28.480 --> 2:01:32.880]  the co-intel pro that oh alex said we'd have martial law alex said we'd
[2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:36.880]  have forced inoculations alex said we'd have this and that
[2:01:36.880 --> 2:01:41.680]  well we would have had all that if you wouldn't have stood up and taken action
[2:01:41.680 --> 2:01:45.760]  see the establishment wants to tell you there is no new world order there is no
[2:01:45.760 --> 2:01:48.320]  threat there is no forced inoculation
[2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:52.560]  even as the internal documents went out from fema getting people ready for it
[2:01:52.560 --> 2:01:56.560]  then multiple states tried it the people stood up and said no
[2:01:56.560 --> 2:02:01.680]  they had to back off we had a major victory so co-intel pro was exposed so
[2:02:01.680 --> 2:02:05.120]  then they flipped their operation say there was never a plan
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:09.360]  for forced inoculations that's a lie
[2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:12.480]  see first there is no plan then they admit their plan
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:16.480]  then they come back and say oh there was no plan
[2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:21.680]  we're having victories and most americans the news is reported have say i don't
[2:02:21.680 --> 2:02:24.960]  want to go through your body scanner i don't want my naked body recorded
[2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:28.640]  and so now they're saying oh look terrorist hit us
[2:02:28.640 --> 2:02:33.680]  we've got to put everybody in a watch list and we've got to put everybody
[2:02:33.680 --> 2:02:38.560]  through the scanner if you don't do it you don't fly
[2:02:38.560 --> 2:02:42.720]  don't worry only foreigners coming to america have to thumb print biometrically
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:45.760]  meanwhile every other country we fly to we now have to do it
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:49.040]  it's all under un treaty but they tell foreigners
[2:02:49.040 --> 2:02:52.720]  oh don't worry only foreigners coming to our countries
[2:02:52.720 --> 2:02:56.000]  like england and germany only they have to thumb print
[2:02:56.000 --> 2:02:59.680]  but then when the germans or the brits they go anywhere they've got a thumb
[2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:02.400]  print because it's already internationalized
[2:03:02.400 --> 2:03:07.840]  and this is all rolled out psychologically to sell the public on going
[2:03:07.840 --> 2:03:10.560]  along with it
[2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:14.880]  now our guest is coming up then i'm going to get to wane mike mike chris

[2:08:14.080 --> 2:08:18.000]  course is indicative of the fact that as independent science has now
[2:08:18.000 --> 2:08:22.880]  confirmed that the globe is actually cooling and has been cooling since 2002
[2:08:22.880 --> 2:08:28.240]  broadly flat since 1998 so we're all talking about something
[2:08:28.240 --> 2:08:31.360]  here which isn't happening i've heard time and time again
[2:08:31.360 --> 2:08:35.120]  members here talk of co2 as a pollutant a pollutant it's a
[2:08:35.120 --> 2:08:38.800]  life-giving natural gas it gives me the impression that some of our members
[2:08:38.800 --> 2:08:44.320]  haven't had the benefit of a formal education isn't this really just about
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:48.880]  the state being able to get its hand in ordinary people's trouser pocket
[2:08:48.880 --> 2:08:52.720]  to steal get more tax from them isn't this all about
[2:08:52.720 --> 2:08:56.640]  political control isn't all this about politics
[2:08:56.640 --> 2:09:00.080]  and big business the whole thing's a sham
[2:09:00.080 --> 2:09:05.920]  this bogus hypothesis this ridiculous nonsense that man made co2 is causing
[2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:10.080]  global warming enough please before we damage irrevocably
[2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:14.480]  the global economy
[2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:20.320]  okay well that's godfrey bloom he's an economist military veteran
[2:09:20.320 --> 2:09:25.440]  he is on the economic monetary affairs committee for the european union parliament
[2:09:25.440 --> 2:09:30.240]  and their environment committee and we have him for the rest of the hour very
[2:09:30.240 --> 2:09:33.360]  honored to have him with us on this
[2:09:33.360 --> 2:09:40.240]  monday the 28th day of december 2009 to give us a european union view
[2:09:40.240 --> 2:09:45.520]  of how this unelected bureaucracy just continues to take over
[2:09:45.520 --> 2:09:49.760]  more and more of our sovereignty and how they openly admit this is a tax to
[2:09:49.760 --> 2:09:53.840]  control our lives and the words of morris strong at the un to
[2:09:53.840 --> 2:09:58.080]  destroy our industrial society so to get a view on what just
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:01.680]  happened in copenhagen and so much more and on what's
[2:10:01.680 --> 2:10:05.600]  happening with the dollar the pound the euro what's
[2:10:05.600 --> 2:10:09.120]  happening with gold to get a lot of different perspectives
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:13.680]  we have godfrey bloom me p a member of european parliament his website is
[2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:18.480]  godfrey bloom me p dot co dot uk thank you for joining us sir
[2:10:18.480 --> 2:10:23.440]  great pleasure alec good to have you here well i just played a brief clip of you
[2:10:23.440 --> 2:10:26.800]  in the uh... e use standing up to these people
[2:10:26.800 --> 2:10:30.320]  uh... what is the state of the european union right now
[2:10:30.320 --> 2:10:33.520]  uh... are they angry that their full power grab failed
[2:10:33.520 --> 2:10:37.600]  gordon brown is saying he doesn't care he is writing the agreement
[2:10:37.600 --> 2:10:43.360]  that the west will pledge money to the i m f and world bank in un regardless
[2:10:43.360 --> 2:10:46.720]  uh... to these private bankers i mean this
[2:10:46.720 --> 2:10:51.680]  when does this swindle and well i'm beginning to wonder actually uh... it
[2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:55.760]  it's it's it's extraordinary but i find that i used to think that the united
[2:10:55.760 --> 2:10:59.680]  kingdom and when it's certain extent europe used to follow the united states
[2:10:59.680 --> 2:11:03.760]  in a lot of these matters and uh... i'm rather i'm rather fancy now that we are
[2:11:03.760 --> 2:11:07.600]  actually uh... slightly ahead of you and i'm watching america make some of the
[2:11:07.600 --> 2:11:12.000]  same mistakes that we've been making uh... since that nineteen forty five
[2:11:12.000 --> 2:11:16.640]  um... we've actually handed over our country the united kingdom one of the
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:18.640]  oldest democracies in the world
[2:11:18.640 --> 2:11:21.680]  has now handed its entire government over
[2:11:21.680 --> 2:11:25.280]  to an unelected bureaucracy uh... in Brussels
[2:11:25.280 --> 2:11:28.880]  but without the will of the british people without any form of referendum
[2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:31.760]  without any understanding of what we've been doing
[2:11:31.760 --> 2:11:36.080]  uh... and and it's uh... something that's been a conspiracy between all the
[2:11:36.080 --> 2:11:38.320]  major parties in the united kingdom
[2:11:38.320 --> 2:11:42.560]  and all the political uh... elements uh... in in the european union
[2:11:42.560 --> 2:11:46.640]  quite quite disgraceful quite horrifying and unbelievable
[2:11:46.640 --> 2:11:52.000]  absolutely uh... just like u.s politics i've studied somewhat uh... the british
[2:11:52.000 --> 2:11:55.520]  system and it's the same thing special globalist interest
[2:11:55.520 --> 2:11:58.800]  come in buy off the two or three or four top parties
[2:11:58.800 --> 2:12:03.040]  the parties may fight with each other over power but not over carrying out
[2:12:03.040 --> 2:12:06.240]  their master's agenda can you break down how
[2:12:06.240 --> 2:12:10.480]  england has been absorbed and and and never been allowed to have a vote
[2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:14.160]  into the european union so americans and canadiens
[2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:18.080]  and mexicans on the north american continent can draw parallels
[2:12:18.080 --> 2:12:21.200]  to how by stealth and that's in the spp
[2:12:21.200 --> 2:12:25.280]  north american union documents we're having north american integration
[2:12:25.280 --> 2:12:28.320]  and we're not allowed to have a vote on it either
[2:12:28.320 --> 2:12:34.080]  yes it's quite uh... it's quite extraordinary in 1975 we had a referendum
[2:12:34.080 --> 2:12:37.360]  uh... and we were told it was called something called the common market we
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:39.760]  were told it was a free trade zone
[2:12:39.760 --> 2:12:44.240]  and of course uh... being a free economist myself and a global free trade
[2:12:44.240 --> 2:12:47.600]  i'm a relatively young man at the time in 1975
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:51.200]  uh... i voted for it as a lot of people did on the basis
[2:12:51.200 --> 2:12:54.960]  that we were told quite categorically wouldn't affect our sovereignty as a
[2:12:54.960 --> 2:12:57.600]  nation uh... it was a free trade area
[2:12:57.600 --> 2:13:00.720]  would bring down trade barriers and bureaucracy
[2:13:00.720 --> 2:13:03.440]  uh... we could all trade with each other and be friends
[2:13:03.440 --> 2:13:07.120]  uh... we all thought that was a good idea there was no question of that being
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:11.200]  political union of any sort this wasn't on the agenda
[2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:14.560]  and we've seen a sort of salami slicing going on now
[2:13:14.560 --> 2:13:18.160]  uh... since 1975 with one treaty after the other
[2:13:18.160 --> 2:13:22.160]  which has taken us uh... towards what we now have
[2:13:22.160 --> 2:13:27.200]  uh... which is a uh... a soviet model we have a soviet model some people try
[2:13:27.200 --> 2:13:29.760]  and pretend it's the united states model but it isn't
[2:13:29.760 --> 2:13:33.840]  it's a soviet model uh... where our laws are actually made by an
[2:13:33.840 --> 2:13:38.800]  unelected bureaucracy and i had some of your congressman over to brussels
[2:13:38.800 --> 2:13:41.600]  uh... who were visiting and i had the pleasure of meeting them
[2:13:41.600 --> 2:13:45.120]  uh... a little while ago just a few weeks ago and they were absolutely
[2:13:45.120 --> 2:13:48.960]  astounded and horrified uh... but the european parliament
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:52.960]  doesn't actually make the law it's an amending chamber
[2:13:52.960 --> 2:13:57.040]  and so we now have 75 percent of our laws in england
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:01.680]  made by an unelected international or european bureaucracy
[2:14:01.680 --> 2:14:04.720]  with actually no recourse to the british voters
[2:14:04.720 --> 2:14:09.760]  there's no cost-benefit analysis there's no debate that you would expect to have
[2:14:09.760 --> 2:14:13.920]  in our westminster chamber uh... and people feel totally powerless
[2:14:13.920 --> 2:14:17.760]  of what's actually happening now uh... is that fewer and fewer people are
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:21.440]  actually voting at elections because they know it doesn't do any good because
[2:14:21.440 --> 2:14:24.800]  their laws are no longer made in london
[2:14:24.800 --> 2:14:29.040]  which is what the bureaucrats love they love people capitulating going into a
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:32.160]  sense of apathy but i have to tell you your party
[2:14:32.160 --> 2:14:36.720]  the uk ip the uk independence party is certainly rising
[2:14:36.720 --> 2:14:40.000]  and a lot of people are losing that apathy and finding out
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:43.840]  that uh... this illegitimate system can be resisted now
[2:14:43.840 --> 2:14:46.720]  expanding on that with european union member of parliament
[2:14:46.720 --> 2:14:50.640]  uh... godfrey bloom for those that don't know
[2:14:50.640 --> 2:14:54.400]  can you explain how this unelected bureaucracy
[2:14:54.400 --> 2:14:58.320]  circumvented or circumnavigated the checks and balances
[2:14:58.320 --> 2:15:01.920]  how they do this by stealth because i've studied it but i'm not as big an expert
[2:15:01.920 --> 2:15:05.520]  obviously as you are being in the european parliament what for five years
[2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:08.880]  because when studying your system it's very similar
[2:15:08.880 --> 2:15:13.360]  and has the very same people involved that are running our north american union
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:18.720]  by stealth and we're just a few decades behind you but but but but the
[2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:23.360]  process of integration is now accelerated here as it is there
[2:15:23.360 --> 2:15:27.200]  and so by understanding this model we can then understand how to throw it off
[2:15:27.200 --> 2:15:29.840]  not just in europe and england but here
[2:15:29.840 --> 2:15:35.680]  uh... in north america as well it's it's extremely difficult actually because
[2:15:35.680 --> 2:15:40.240]  um... you you like us have a two-party system we have the conservatives of
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:43.040]  labor you have republicans and democrats
[2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:46.400]  it's extremely difficult if the two parties that you have
[2:15:46.400 --> 2:15:49.920]  uh... and that's a sort of democracy that's grown up over the years
[2:15:49.920 --> 2:15:53.360]  you either vote for the republicans or democrats over there
[2:15:53.360 --> 2:15:56.400]  we have a vote for the conservative party or the labor party
[2:15:56.400 --> 2:16:00.880]  but what we actually have is the two parties actually agree on the main
[2:16:00.880 --> 2:16:05.760]  fundamentals of handing over control to an international political elite
[2:16:05.760 --> 2:16:08.320]  and what we've actually built up over the years
[2:16:08.320 --> 2:16:12.640]  uh... is a political elite which is totally and utterly divorced
[2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:16.720]  from the will of ordinary people and so when you go
[2:16:16.720 --> 2:16:20.640]  uh... into we go into the pub you go into bars or we go into the cricket club
[2:16:20.640 --> 2:16:24.400]  you go into the baseball club or whatever you find that ordinary people
[2:16:24.400 --> 2:16:27.680]  don't want any of this but they've been sidelined by
[2:16:27.680 --> 2:16:31.600]  professional politicians whereas maybe two hundred years ago
[2:16:31.600 --> 2:16:34.720]  certainly in europe there was an aristocratic class
[2:16:34.720 --> 2:16:38.000]  uh... who ran europe now with the political class
[2:16:38.000 --> 2:16:42.400]  uh... of course they have complete control over public service broadcasting
[2:16:42.400 --> 2:16:46.720]  over here the bbc uh... is funded and paid for by the same
[2:16:46.720 --> 2:16:49.920]  people uh... and they promulgate the same
[2:16:49.920 --> 2:16:53.280]  view that we should be uh... internationally governed
[2:16:53.280 --> 2:16:56.880]  and so it leaves democracy completely behind
[2:16:56.880 --> 2:17:00.080]  and let's be clear you have a bureaucracy
[2:17:00.080 --> 2:17:04.880]  that sets the policies and then all the elected parliament that's represented
[2:17:04.880 --> 2:17:10.240]  by the different nations all you can do is basically amend
[2:17:10.240 --> 2:17:15.920]  uh... or debate smaller smaller sections so so literally
[2:17:15.920 --> 2:17:19.360]  uh... the once sovereign nations of europe and england
[2:17:19.360 --> 2:17:23.760]  have been turned into vestigial ceremonial offices
[2:17:23.760 --> 2:17:28.400]  uh... this is quite true and of course it's totally against our constitution
[2:17:28.400 --> 2:17:32.560]  what a lot of americans might visit america quite a lot and i love to do so
[2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:35.520]  uh... they're not fully uh... they don't fully understand that
[2:17:35.520 --> 2:17:38.560]  we do actually have a constitution in britain
[2:17:38.560 --> 2:17:42.000]  uh... we did we do have something called the
[2:17:42.000 --> 2:17:47.040]  uh... bill of rights uh... which was uh... formulated in 1688 so it's several
[2:17:47.040 --> 2:17:50.480]  hundred years old that you have the parliament act to don't you know even
[2:17:50.480 --> 2:17:55.200]  before that magna carta we do and if you go back to 1215 of course you go quite
[2:17:55.200 --> 2:18:00.080]  rightly i'd expect magna carta so we've had a thousand years nearly
[2:18:00.080 --> 2:18:04.960]  uh... of developing a parliamentary constitutional democracy under a
[2:18:04.960 --> 2:18:08.480]  constitutional monarchy that by the way for those that don't know was bought
[2:18:08.480 --> 2:18:12.080]  with a lot of blood and a lot of uh...
[2:18:12.080 --> 2:18:16.400]  heroics that was in the model for our system here in the united states
[2:18:16.400 --> 2:18:20.320]  well that's quite right uh... we fought to preserve a constitutional
[2:18:20.320 --> 2:18:25.280]  democratic uh... monarchy uh... in many many wars and and of course
[2:18:25.280 --> 2:18:30.000]  uh... in the last century alongside the united states as our great ally
[2:18:30.000 --> 2:18:34.240]  uh... i'm a great believer in the transatlantic alliance between our two
[2:18:34.240 --> 2:18:38.960]  our two nations uh... because we basically we think alike and we believe
[2:18:38.960 --> 2:18:43.520]  in the same things but what with the problem with us is that we've discarded
[2:18:43.520 --> 2:18:47.120]  our constitution and i noticed almost on a
[2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:51.200]  you know on a yearly basis the same thing is happening to america
[2:18:51.200 --> 2:18:55.280]  you've discarded your constitution and we regard a certainly
[2:18:55.280 --> 2:18:58.960]  thinking people over here regard the american constitution as one of the
[2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:02.160]  greatest documents ever written
[2:19:02.160 --> 2:19:06.320]  it's amazing that they're getting rid of due process secret arrest is being
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:11.280]  implemented warrantless spying all the same systems we see in europe england
[2:19:11.280 --> 2:19:15.520]  are being implemented in the u.s. the bureaucracies even give the programs the
[2:19:15.520 --> 2:19:20.640]  same names this is all being internationally organized and
[2:19:20.640 --> 2:19:24.240]  five members of our supreme court have said in the last two years
[2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:27.760]  that they will follow u.n. courts above our courts
[2:19:27.760 --> 2:19:32.720]  when this is a despotism we have in brussels a despotism we have in in
[2:19:32.720 --> 2:19:37.600]  in uh... manhattan now obama has signed an executive order
[2:19:37.600 --> 2:19:43.360]  saying inner poll has diplomatic immunity in the u.s. above even our own fb i
[2:19:43.360 --> 2:19:46.880]  i want to talk about what it's like living under this tyranny

[2:22:04.480 --> 2:22:07.520]  reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending
[2:22:07.520 --> 2:22:11.360]  therefore with catastrophic events it comes as no surprise that some banks
[2:22:11.360 --> 2:22:14.560]  have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove
[2:22:14.560 --> 2:22:18.400]  from their accounts a fractional reserve system means only a small portion of
[2:22:18.400 --> 2:22:21.920]  your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal deficit spending
[2:22:21.920 --> 2:22:25.600]  will skyrocket through fdic if the government is forced to ensure deposits
[2:22:25.600 --> 2:22:28.320]  during a bank run followed by a depressed economy
[2:22:28.320 --> 2:22:32.000]  a current effort is underway by the fed along with other central banks to
[2:22:32.000 --> 2:22:35.600]  increase liquidity for depositors however an increase in money supply
[2:22:35.600 --> 2:22:38.960]  without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation
[2:22:38.960 --> 2:22:42.640]  in order to achieve strength and stability i recommend a conservative
[2:22:42.640 --> 2:22:46.960]  portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver
[2:22:46.960 --> 2:22:50.160]  while paper investments currently have been driven by debt
[2:22:50.160 --> 2:22:53.520]  gold on its own has held value for over 6000 years

[2:24:21.200 --> 2:24:29.200]  the hour websites godfrey bloom mep.co.uk
[2:24:29.200 --> 2:24:32.560]  sir it it does seem though that as the european union
[2:24:32.560 --> 2:24:36.560]  unelected tries to take power tries to abuse people
[2:24:36.560 --> 2:24:39.520]  more and more countries are voting to not expand their power
[2:24:39.520 --> 2:24:42.800]  though they just keep coming back with referendums till they do
[2:24:42.800 --> 2:24:47.600]  uh it looks like Greece and other countries may go bankrupt under the EU
[2:24:47.600 --> 2:24:51.040]  i mean there's more and more talk of the EU falling apart a is that
[2:24:51.040 --> 2:24:57.280]  accurate b should we hope for that i mean how do we combat these people
[2:24:57.280 --> 2:25:00.640]  well we've had a we've got some of the problems we have is in the differences
[2:25:00.640 --> 2:25:04.560]  of law that we have in the united states in the united kingdom
[2:25:04.560 --> 2:25:07.760]  we have three main pillars of our legal system
[2:25:07.760 --> 2:25:12.640]  that is the presumption of innocence trial by jury and the concept of habeas
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:15.120]  corpus i either state can't lock somebody up
[2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:18.480]  without giving them a proper trial and um
[2:25:18.480 --> 2:25:21.920]  uh... uh... and uh... uh... judicial system
[2:25:21.920 --> 2:25:26.880]  now the we've taken over all the european union has taken over something
[2:25:26.880 --> 2:25:31.760]  called the Napoleonic code which doesn't embody any of these things
[2:25:31.760 --> 2:25:36.080]  uh... our supreme court which was in fact the house of lord
[2:25:36.080 --> 2:25:40.080]  that was our final but that was our final court of appeal legally
[2:25:40.080 --> 2:25:45.520]  has been taken over uh... by the european court of justice which outranks
[2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:48.960]  that now under a completely different system of
[2:25:48.960 --> 2:25:53.280]  of law uh... they have a prescriptive system of law
[2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:57.040]  and where these two things are extremely different and this is something
[2:25:57.040 --> 2:26:01.600]  that your listeners need to understand because this is where it all begins
[2:26:01.600 --> 2:26:04.960]  uh... the system that we have in the united kingdom
[2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:09.520]  and largely the same in the united uh... state of america
[2:26:09.520 --> 2:26:13.040]  is that they is that the legal system tells you
[2:26:13.040 --> 2:26:17.040]  that which you may not do so there are a book of rules
[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:20.560]  of things that you cannot do which we would all accept
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:25.280]  is fundamentally fair now the system of government that's coming to europe and
[2:26:25.280 --> 2:26:29.920]  i think is coming into the united states is a system which tells you that which
[2:26:29.920 --> 2:26:33.120]  you can do a prescriptive legal system
[2:26:33.120 --> 2:26:36.560]  which is extremely dangerous and extremely sinister
[2:26:36.560 --> 2:26:40.560]  we do not want the government of the day to tell us what we can do
[2:26:40.560 --> 2:26:44.160]  we just want a small book of rules and if i may just
[2:26:44.160 --> 2:26:47.920]  uh... use a little analogy which i often use here which will help your
[2:26:47.920 --> 2:26:51.200]  listeners understand the point that i'm making
[2:26:51.200 --> 2:26:55.040]  uh... is that those of you with uh... those of your listeners with children
[2:26:55.040 --> 2:26:58.320]  teenage children probably say as we do in england
[2:26:58.320 --> 2:27:02.960]  look uh... there are half a dozen things you can't do in your room
[2:27:02.960 --> 2:27:07.280]  you know you you can't smoke you can't play loud music no members opposite sex
[2:27:07.280 --> 2:27:11.360]  late at night whatever probably half a dozen fairly sensible rules
[2:27:11.360 --> 2:27:14.800]  but apart from that the room belongs to
[2:27:14.800 --> 2:27:17.600]  uh... you know the teenager and it's their space
[2:27:17.600 --> 2:27:21.600]  and i think that's the way we've always wanted to work in our two countries
[2:27:21.600 --> 2:27:25.040]  um... if you start telling them kids what they can do
[2:27:25.040 --> 2:27:30.160]  you have a completely legalistic uh... uh... and and prescriptive system
[2:27:30.160 --> 2:27:32.640]  uh... which nobody wants and of course that means
[2:27:32.640 --> 2:27:35.760]  you actually lose that concept of freedom
[2:27:35.760 --> 2:27:39.920]  uh... under the law which we all value so highly and you rightly said earlier
[2:27:39.920 --> 2:27:43.680]  alex so many so many young men have died for over the last
[2:27:43.680 --> 2:27:48.160]  hundred years it's amazing
[2:27:48.160 --> 2:27:51.760]  but expanding on this was it not a
[2:27:51.760 --> 2:27:55.520]  grievous blow uh... was it a mortal blow
[2:27:55.520 --> 2:27:59.360]  uh... to have their copenhagen treaty
[2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:04.160]  uh... blow up in their face or as gordon brown saying hey
[2:28:04.160 --> 2:28:07.760]  we've always been an unelected bureaucracy we'll just go ahead and
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:10.880]  write up the agreement and we'll start monitoring countries
[2:28:10.880 --> 2:28:14.800]  whether they like it or not and we'll start taxing the england
[2:28:14.800 --> 2:28:19.040]  uh... the european union and the u.s and we'll take that money
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:23.360]  and give it to these private banks to go out and buy off countries to go ahead
[2:28:23.360 --> 2:28:27.200]  and go along with it i mean they show what tyrants they are
[2:28:27.200 --> 2:28:30.720]  in that even though the copenhagen thing fell apart
[2:28:30.720 --> 2:28:34.960]  they're still going ahead with it there's nothing there's nothing that the
[2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:41.360]  modern political class uh... seems to take notice of of ordinary voters they
[2:28:41.360 --> 2:28:45.840]  they don't seem to care about what ordinary people think now for example
[2:28:45.840 --> 2:28:49.440]  my party the united kingdom independence party at the last european
[2:28:49.440 --> 2:28:52.400]  election on june the fourth came second
[2:28:52.400 --> 2:28:56.400]  uh... over the whole country in the united kingdom and you know very well
[2:28:56.400 --> 2:28:59.040]  over there how difficult it is to start a new
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:03.440]  political party it's almost impossible in a two-party system
[2:29:03.440 --> 2:29:07.360]  uh... in the united kingdom and the united states but it gives you the depth of
[2:29:07.360 --> 2:29:12.320]  feeling there is amongst ordinary people but still they ignore us and and the
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:16.400]  uh... of course you know that the french voted against in their referendum only
[2:29:16.400 --> 2:29:20.880]  only uh... two years ago the french voted no the dutch voted no
[2:29:20.880 --> 2:29:24.480]  they won't give the british a referendum on the new lisbon treaty which is the
[2:29:24.480 --> 2:29:27.920]  final treaty which is a self-amending treaty so
[2:29:27.920 --> 2:29:32.560]  um with all this the democracy has been completely removed there is absolutely
[2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:36.800]  no democratic dimension now sir we've got a break
[2:29:36.800 --> 2:29:41.440]  system of government long segment coming up continue along that
[2:29:41.440 --> 2:29:45.280]  thought line and how we beat these people on the other side i mean
[2:29:45.280 --> 2:29:48.560]  obviously we warn more people about the undemocratic nature
[2:29:48.560 --> 2:29:52.000]  of these people but what else can we do
[2:29:52.000 --> 2:29:55.840]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:55.840 --> 2:30:01.280]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[2:30:04.480 --> 2:30:08.480]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily

[2:30:25.200 --> 2:30:28.160]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:30:28.160 --> 2:30:32.000]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[2:30:32.000 --> 2:30:35.200]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[2:30:35.200 --> 2:30:38.640]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[2:34:27.920 --> 2:34:31.920]  special honors program woosie college
[2:34:31.920 --> 2:34:35.760]  wesley massachusetts hillary rottem clinton political science
[2:34:35.760 --> 2:34:40.480]  may 2nd 1969 she probably wanted to get the paper in on may 1st was a bit late
[2:34:40.480 --> 2:34:44.400]  though okay communist holiday these people make me
[2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:47.520]  sick but why do you see such big banks big money
[2:34:47.520 --> 2:34:52.080]  for socialism and communism because they can pool the middle classes money
[2:34:52.080 --> 2:34:57.360]  run our lives the monopoly capitalist can shut down their competition
[2:34:57.360 --> 2:35:01.680]  and then they can have a gaggle of armed thug communist running around enforcing
[2:35:01.680 --> 2:35:05.680]  it for him going to economist military veteran
[2:35:05.680 --> 2:35:09.760]  he's on the economy and monetary affairs committee of the european union
[2:35:09.760 --> 2:35:15.520]  parliament and the environmental committee as well godfrey bloom is our
[2:35:15.520 --> 2:35:18.320]  guest sir dealing with the mindset you've been in the
[2:35:18.320 --> 2:35:23.360]  parliament what five years i have indeed and so you're you're around
[2:35:23.360 --> 2:35:27.120]  these globalists you're around these most of them lap dogs most of them from
[2:35:27.120 --> 2:35:31.440]  eastern europe uh... who openly love tyranny i'm not bashing eastern europeans
[2:35:31.440 --> 2:35:36.320]  but most these guys are former uh... i guess apparatus is the word or
[2:35:36.320 --> 2:35:38.880]  commas ours i've seen the list many of them
[2:35:38.880 --> 2:35:43.120]  were hardcore thugs uh... for kruschev and people i mean you can't make this
[2:35:43.120 --> 2:35:46.080]  stuff up and so all of that's going on
[2:35:46.080 --> 2:35:49.360]  what is their mindset what makes them tick and
[2:35:49.360 --> 2:35:54.480]  and uh... how big a blow was this what happened at kopenhagen and
[2:35:54.480 --> 2:35:58.240]  what is the environmental movement really to these people because my
[2:35:58.240 --> 2:36:02.320]  research shows they're not useful idiots they know it's a cold-blooded
[2:36:02.320 --> 2:36:06.960]  resource grab they know it's a scam i mean we've got local commas ours here in
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:11.600]  austin i've talked to over dinner and they say alex join the team we're robbing
[2:36:11.600 --> 2:36:14.400]  everyone i mean it's a big joke to them
[2:36:14.400 --> 2:36:16.720]  do you get the same thing out of these people
[2:36:16.720 --> 2:36:20.800]  uh... i don't in the parliament no i'm dealing with people who are not as
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:24.960]  clever as that i'm dealing people with people are fundamentally stupid
[2:36:24.960 --> 2:36:28.640]  a lot of them haven't had the benefit of what i would regard as a formal
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:32.640]  education you heard in that the speech that i made at the beginning
[2:36:32.640 --> 2:36:36.080]  uh... that which i made to the parliament we're dealing with people who think
[2:36:36.080 --> 2:36:39.520]  that carbon dioxide is some sort of pollute pollute
[2:36:39.520 --> 2:36:42.880]  i'm dealing with people who don't know the difference between carbon and carbon
[2:36:42.880 --> 2:36:46.080]  dioxide i'm dealing with the difference between people who don't know the
[2:36:46.080 --> 2:36:49.200]  difference between carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide
[2:36:49.200 --> 2:36:52.880]  i'm dealing with people who are almost incredibly stupid
[2:36:52.880 --> 2:36:56.560]  uh... and they are deliberately placed there by the main parties
[2:36:56.560 --> 2:37:00.720]  not to make a fuss so when it comes to things like kopenhagen you're actually
[2:37:00.720 --> 2:37:05.360]  dealing with members of my committee who actually believe this nonsense
[2:37:05.360 --> 2:37:09.200]  and they believe this nonsense because they want to believe it and of course
[2:37:09.200 --> 2:37:13.440]  there's nobody so gullible as somebody who wants to believe something that
[2:37:13.440 --> 2:37:16.960]  they've been told because it actually now is a threat
[2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:21.280]  through every committee if this green thread that runs
[2:37:21.280 --> 2:37:24.720]  it's a power grab it means that we can grab more power
[2:37:24.720 --> 2:37:29.680]  all the time from the people undermine the democratic situation because if we
[2:37:29.680 --> 2:37:33.680]  don't take away these powers that people have died for under a democratic
[2:37:33.680 --> 2:37:37.760]  society for years that the world is going to end it's a wonderful line
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:40.960]  alex isn't it we know that we're breaking with
[2:37:40.960 --> 2:37:44.720]  with democratic tradition we know we're doing things that people don't want
[2:37:44.720 --> 2:37:48.720]  but if we don't do this we're doing this to save themselves
[2:37:48.720 --> 2:37:51.760]  we're doing this to save the people to save the planet
[2:37:51.760 --> 2:37:56.560]  it's a superb one-liner and of course in all the state schools in the united
[2:37:56.560 --> 2:38:01.440]  kingdom this is being pushed forward uh... under the special system that they
[2:38:01.440 --> 2:38:06.240]  have now in english state schools uh... where they are told teachers are told
[2:38:06.240 --> 2:38:09.040]  what they can teach how they can teach it
[2:38:09.040 --> 2:38:12.480]  most of the information in our country comes from television
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:17.680]  television most television here is bbc uh... all the senior appointments of
[2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:20.960]  the bbc the director general the governor the presenters
[2:38:20.960 --> 2:38:24.080]  are all employees of number ten downing street
[2:38:24.080 --> 2:38:27.760]  uh... because that's how the system works so there's this absolute
[2:38:27.760 --> 2:38:32.880]  relentless barrage uh... of of of bogus junk science
[2:38:32.880 --> 2:38:36.880]  uh... that's been pushed at the people uh... and it's been going on now for
[2:38:36.880 --> 2:38:41.120]  ages uh... and and but what is interesting enough
[2:38:41.120 --> 2:38:45.120]  that still the times newspaper did a survey a little while ago just a few
[2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:49.600]  weeks ago that said over fifty percent of ordinary people don't believe a word
[2:38:49.600 --> 2:38:54.960]  of it so there's still plenty of hope
[2:38:54.960 --> 2:38:59.760]  absolutely there is a lot of hope because this is undemocratic
[2:38:59.760 --> 2:39:03.760]  it is tyrannical and and in history
[2:39:03.760 --> 2:39:07.600]  if people just continue to tell the truth and continue to expose
[2:39:07.600 --> 2:39:13.040]  uh... a fraud it will implode here's the problem though
[2:39:13.040 --> 2:39:17.520]  even though they've been exposed to scam artist as frauds
[2:39:17.520 --> 2:39:21.920]  the establishment just continues on
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:27.920]  down the same path and they're so over the top in their fraud
[2:39:27.920 --> 2:39:32.640]  uh... three years ago i interviewed david the Rothschild the heir to the
[2:39:32.640 --> 2:39:37.840]  largest Rothschild fortune who was then billed as savior of the planet
[2:39:37.840 --> 2:39:41.760]  here he is on the cover of outside magazine
[2:39:41.760 --> 2:39:48.560]  the hero gene how to tap into yours and it actually says in here that he's
[2:39:48.560 --> 2:39:52.000]  like jesus christ i guess the Rothschilds have always thought they
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:56.080]  were the merovingian line and so it says he is a savior
[2:39:56.080 --> 2:40:01.200]  he is a christ i mean this is a new religion al gore has said they're going
[2:40:01.200 --> 2:40:07.280]  into religion the plastic jesus and then i have al gore here
[2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:10.720]  saying he is the this is newsweek the eco
[2:40:10.720 --> 2:40:15.040]  profit and it says he's the thinking man thinking man saving us
[2:40:15.040 --> 2:40:21.040]  when i had Rothschild on he said i said why are the ice caps on mars melting
[2:40:21.040 --> 2:40:24.400]  they've since started getting larger again because the sun's cooled off and he
[2:40:24.400 --> 2:40:28.480]  said because the mars is closer to the sun than the earth
[2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:32.320]  and i said no mars is the next planet out
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:35.680]  and i said why are the moons on jupiter and Saturn melting and he said well
[2:40:35.680 --> 2:40:39.920]  they're closer to the sun than the earth and i said no they're not
[2:40:39.920 --> 2:40:43.760]  and and you know he laughed at me not because he didn't know
[2:40:43.760 --> 2:40:47.600]  but he thought my audience was like the general public so dumb
[2:40:47.600 --> 2:40:52.160]  i mean al gore didn't invent the internet uh polar bears aren't drowning
[2:40:52.160 --> 2:40:56.000]  their numbers are way up but they know carbon
[2:40:56.000 --> 2:40:59.920]  isn't carbon dioxide they know all this but they
[2:40:59.920 --> 2:41:04.080]  they just they're so over the top that they just keep getting away with it
[2:41:04.080 --> 2:41:10.080]  how do you counter this level of uh just over the top in your
[2:41:10.080 --> 2:41:13.520]  faceness i think what we need to do and we've
[2:41:13.520 --> 2:41:17.280]  started over here we haven't got that far along the road yet
[2:41:17.280 --> 2:41:20.800]  but my party the united kingdom independence party
[2:41:20.800 --> 2:41:25.840]  was born out of ordinary people the ordinary man and we have an expression
[2:41:25.840 --> 2:41:28.960]  over here the ordinary man on the cap and omni bus
[2:41:28.960 --> 2:41:32.480]  it's just you know the ordinary you call it i think you call him an ordinary joe
[2:41:32.480 --> 2:41:37.120]  or you call him joe six pack um these people you've got to have faith in them
[2:41:37.120 --> 2:41:40.800]  i don't think they're nearly as stupid as the liberal middle-class elite think
[2:41:40.800 --> 2:41:45.200]  they are they know they're being conned they know they're being lied to
[2:41:45.200 --> 2:41:48.960]  and they're voting for us now when when we have a proportional representation
[2:41:48.960 --> 2:41:52.400]  system when we get away from the two-party system which we have
[2:41:52.400 --> 2:41:56.560]  for our european elections they feel that they can vote for us
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:41:59.840]  uh and they do vote for this and they're in their millions
[2:41:59.840 --> 2:42:03.760]  uh and now what we need to do is uh we're going to continue with this we're
[2:42:03.760 --> 2:42:07.680]  putting 500 candidates up for the west minster elections in may
[2:42:07.680 --> 2:42:13.840]  that's virtually a complete ticket uh of um of of u-kit uh people
[2:42:13.840 --> 2:42:17.680]  uh so everybody in every constituency can say just a minute
[2:42:17.680 --> 2:42:22.720]  i have got an alternative and i think the same thing needs to happen in america
[2:42:22.720 --> 2:42:26.800]  um because you do lead the world you will always lead the world for the
[2:42:26.800 --> 2:42:30.080]  foreseeable future and you can turn this round
[2:42:30.080 --> 2:42:33.920]  and i think if people could look to america the new world if you will
[2:42:33.920 --> 2:42:37.840]  uh by doing something like this i think it would be fabulous and if i'll be it
[2:42:37.840 --> 2:42:40.560]  for me to suggest what you should call that party
[2:42:40.560 --> 2:42:43.920]  but i would call it the american constitution party
[2:42:43.920 --> 2:42:47.680]  because most of what's going on as i see it in america and the same thing in the
[2:42:47.680 --> 2:42:51.280]  united kingdom is actually a breach of constitution
[2:42:51.280 --> 2:42:54.240]  and if you could get back to your constitution i mean just looking at
[2:42:54.240 --> 2:42:58.160]  this uh that the situation within topol looking at climate
[2:42:58.160 --> 2:43:03.120]  looking at even at uh uh the new med and the new health care bill that's coming
[2:43:03.120 --> 2:43:05.760]  through uh congress and the senate that you're dealing
[2:43:05.760 --> 2:43:09.040]  without there at the moment that is completely alien to the american
[2:43:09.040 --> 2:43:12.720]  constitution it says nowhere that i can see in the american
[2:43:12.720 --> 2:43:16.640]  constitution that you are responsible for your neighbor's health bills
[2:43:16.640 --> 2:43:20.480]  but even worse than that even if you're for socialism which is alien to our
[2:43:20.480 --> 2:43:23.840]  system which creates dependency and corruption
[2:43:23.840 --> 2:43:28.560]  and waste obama is massively cutting medicare and medicaid
[2:43:28.560 --> 2:43:32.400]  while jacking up taxes and prison time
[2:43:32.400 --> 2:43:37.600]  if you don't get the insurance and uh if you tell your doctor you don't want a
[2:43:37.600 --> 2:43:39.840]  certain treatment the government throws you off the
[2:43:39.840 --> 2:43:44.560]  rolls and it does create government bureaucracies that decide
[2:43:44.560 --> 2:43:48.880]  what treatment you get it does give you rationing i'll never forget
[2:43:48.880 --> 2:43:52.080]  three or four years ago right before gordon brown got into power
[2:43:52.080 --> 2:43:55.760]  i watched tony blare in the house of commons during prime minister's questions
[2:43:55.760 --> 2:44:00.640]  on c span and he admitted one person one member of the parliament got up and
[2:44:00.640 --> 2:44:03.600]  said uh of the house of commons got up and said
[2:44:03.600 --> 2:44:07.360]  well my constituent had to wait 18 months for a brain tumor
[2:44:07.360 --> 2:44:11.680]  um operation normally it's over 90 percent
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:14.560]  operable but because she had to wait so long she died
[2:44:14.560 --> 2:44:18.320]  and tony blare said yes it's true that happens and we're working on that
[2:44:18.320 --> 2:44:21.520]  i mean i don't think the average american realizes
[2:44:21.520 --> 2:44:25.360]  that under the european socialist health care model
[2:44:25.360 --> 2:44:29.600]  that a lot of hellish stuff happens can you fill people in here who may be in the
[2:44:29.600 --> 2:44:34.400]  dark about that sir yes we we did what you're what you're doing now we did in
[2:44:34.400 --> 2:44:41.200]  1946 1947 we got rid of a perfectly good health
[2:44:41.200 --> 2:44:44.800]  system uh which was based on individuals and
[2:44:44.800 --> 2:44:48.400]  individuals uh relationships with their own doctors and their own local
[2:44:48.400 --> 2:44:52.640]  hospitals which were built on some part charitable
[2:44:52.640 --> 2:44:56.240]  status part fee paid status uh and they brought in
[2:44:56.240 --> 2:44:59.440]  this terrible monolith called the national health system
[2:44:59.440 --> 2:45:03.680]  and the national health system uh we have bred a monster that you wouldn't
[2:45:03.680 --> 2:45:06.800]  believe it's the biggest employer in europe
[2:45:06.800 --> 2:45:11.360]  it costs literally billions and billions and billions of pounds a year
[2:45:11.360 --> 2:45:14.480]  we've just wasted eight billion pounds but
[2:45:14.480 --> 2:45:18.560]  10 over 10 billion dollars on a failed it system
[2:45:18.560 --> 2:45:23.440]  nothing in the national health system works uh it's a sacred cow over here
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:28.800]  would you believe that now we have more administrators in the system than we
[2:45:28.800 --> 2:45:33.040]  have hospital beds this is the sort of lunacy that you get
[2:45:33.040 --> 2:45:36.800]  and i'd be reading through uh the bill i'm not an expert on it
[2:45:36.800 --> 2:45:41.040]  but i would beg you and i'd beg all your listeners but good to say right to
[2:45:41.040 --> 2:45:44.880]  whoever does represent you and say for god's sake don't vote for this
[2:45:44.880 --> 2:45:49.360]  this will be a disaster well look at the v-a i don't quite know how it's
[2:45:49.360 --> 2:45:53.760]  happened but you seem to have elected a socialist president and i i don't know
[2:45:53.760 --> 2:45:58.080]  how it happened well look at the v-a i mean hellish
[2:45:58.080 --> 2:46:01.680]  health care for our veterans uh more than half the money gets spent on
[2:46:01.680 --> 2:46:06.400]  administration not on the health care and
[2:46:06.400 --> 2:46:11.760]  reading this bill uh it is just a giant boondoggle it it it gives the
[2:46:11.760 --> 2:46:14.720]  insurance companies government immunity it gives the
[2:46:14.720 --> 2:46:19.040]  hospitals immunity and and you talk about globalization
[2:46:19.040 --> 2:46:21.760]  global governance all these things that are happening
[2:46:21.760 --> 2:46:25.840]  they have to get rid of local control to the national level
[2:46:25.840 --> 2:46:29.920]  if the national is going to be handed over to the international
[2:46:29.920 --> 2:46:34.480]  and we've interviewed nizel farage a former leader of your party and others
[2:46:34.480 --> 2:46:38.080]  we've interviewed lord montan and others who talk about global governance
[2:46:38.080 --> 2:46:41.760]  the new head of the european union as you know herman von rumpi
[2:46:41.760 --> 2:46:45.120]  says this is the first year of global governance they believe the kopenhagen
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:48.880]  treaty was the first year of global governance can you speak to
[2:46:48.880 --> 2:46:54.240]  this pan global europe that the eu talks about the european union model
[2:46:54.240 --> 2:46:58.560]  taking over the planet through treaties and i remind listeners three years ago
[2:46:58.560 --> 2:47:03.440]  george bush signed a transatlantic treaty with the spp security prosperity
[2:47:03.440 --> 2:47:07.120]  partnership with the european union so this integration
[2:47:07.120 --> 2:47:12.560]  is far along under stealth can you speak to their master plan
[2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:17.520]  yes certainly i uh all i can tell so far is that we're dealing with a we're
[2:47:17.520 --> 2:47:21.360]  dealing with a sort of a european soviet system and of course
[2:47:21.360 --> 2:47:26.640]  all we need to do then is if we if we if we then have a north american or an
[2:47:26.640 --> 2:47:30.320]  american system which is similar and and it's going that way
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:33.520]  every day you get closer to that situation
[2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:37.280]  it's only a matter of time before those two power blocks come
[2:47:37.280 --> 2:47:41.200]  come together the only thing at the moment that is stopping that going
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:45.760]  forward to the even faster rate is the fundamental hostility
[2:47:45.760 --> 2:47:50.880]  in the european uh... uh... bureaucracy and parliament a fundamental
[2:47:50.880 --> 2:47:55.680]  hostility to the united states a fundamental hostility to the concept of
[2:47:55.680 --> 2:48:00.080]  free trade and capitalism with the fundamental hostility to this
[2:48:00.080 --> 2:48:04.400]  so that there's actually a sort of a a theoretical
[2:48:04.400 --> 2:48:07.760]  problem that needs to be overcome but as soon as that is overcome
[2:48:07.760 --> 2:48:10.960]  you've got to understand that these as i'm sure you're listening to
[2:48:10.960 --> 2:48:16.320]  that that the senior politicians uh... they don't have anything to do with the
[2:48:16.320 --> 2:48:19.760]  nhs they go into private wards they're privately looked after
[2:48:19.760 --> 2:48:22.800]  if they have a brain tumor it's dealt with immediately
[2:48:22.800 --> 2:48:27.760]  uh... but senior politicians do not go to do not get to their children to the
[2:48:27.760 --> 2:48:30.800]  same school they do not go to the same hospital
[2:48:30.800 --> 2:48:33.680]  uh... did you know for example i i wonder if you did
[2:48:33.680 --> 2:48:38.000]  but the bureaucracy in Brussels uh... all the civil servant bureaucracy
[2:48:38.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  which is enormous don't pay tax did you know that they don't pay income tax
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:45.920]  salaries are free of tax so consequently the more they vote for
[2:48:45.920 --> 2:48:49.520]  centralism statism and high tax and high spending
[2:48:49.520 --> 2:48:53.120]  they're actually out of the loop themselves now that's a key point you just
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:57.360]  made is unaffected that's a key point our own congress here
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:00.880]  exempts themselves from most of their fines and fees
[2:49:00.880 --> 2:49:04.960]  uh... there's a law that they have to pay taxes but fifty plus percent
[2:49:04.960 --> 2:49:09.440]  have been caught just not paying go back over that though
[2:49:09.440 --> 2:49:14.080]  because i was not aware of that uh... i mean i knew that that went on a lot of
[2:49:14.080 --> 2:49:18.160]  communist countries they are exempt from their own taxes
[2:49:18.160 --> 2:49:21.920]  that is the greatest mark of tyranny
[2:49:21.920 --> 2:49:24.880]  is when you it's like animal farm
[2:49:24.880 --> 2:49:28.320]  uh... you know four legs good two legs better
[2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:32.000]  i mean this is just unbelievable say that again i'm
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:35.840]  i'm not doing a double take here something called a sort of
[2:49:35.840 --> 2:49:38.880]  there's a there's a notional sort of uh...
[2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:43.520]  international tax which is which is put on the bureaucrats
[2:49:43.520 --> 2:49:47.120]  uh... which is very it's only marginal it's something like ten percent
[2:49:47.120 --> 2:49:51.200]  where's everybody else in europe including me incidentious many p i pay
[2:49:51.200 --> 2:49:53.920]  british tax i pay about forty five percent of my
[2:49:53.920 --> 2:49:58.400]  income in tax uh... but the actual bureaucracy which makes the laws
[2:49:58.400 --> 2:50:02.080]  so the people who actually make the law
[2:50:02.080 --> 2:50:08.080]  do not pay taxes as ordinary individuals they pay very marginal tax
[2:50:08.080 --> 2:50:12.720]  they also don't pay vat so they drive big range rovers they buy a brand new
[2:50:12.720 --> 2:50:17.760]  range rovers say to some bnw and there's no vat now vat on the continent on the
[2:50:17.760 --> 2:50:21.760]  car is twenty percent so you imagine an immediate twenty percent
[2:50:21.760 --> 2:50:24.880]  discount on your new car uh... they it's just
[2:50:24.880 --> 2:50:27.760]  like the saviour system it's just like the pollock bureau
[2:50:27.760 --> 2:50:32.240]  unbelievable yeah everybody standing in sausage lines but all the communist
[2:50:32.240 --> 2:50:34.960]  officials have two or three vellas and race horses
[2:50:34.960 --> 2:50:40.640]  so they are exempt they are a super class
[2:50:40.640 --> 2:50:44.960]  who give themselves immunity from taxes just like inner pole
[2:50:44.960 --> 2:50:49.840]  and the u n can run around the world engaging whenever crimes they want
[2:50:49.840 --> 2:50:53.520]  and they're given diplomatic immunity this is the internationalist
[2:50:53.520 --> 2:50:57.600]  super class that roth cop talks about his book super class

[2:54:22.160 --> 2:54:28.080]  sololensky thesis which has been classified has been released in full
[2:54:28.080 --> 2:54:32.240]  we were reading over this some during the break it is absolute communism how
[2:54:32.240 --> 2:54:36.400]  she's a communist oh god help us i mean how did we ever
[2:54:36.400 --> 2:54:40.160]  let this folks communist killed three four five times
[2:54:40.160 --> 2:54:42.880]  depending on which numbers you look at more than hitler
[2:54:42.880 --> 2:54:47.840]  i mean there's nothing worse than communist these are just dirty thieves
[2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:50.960]  they don't care about the poor and they know it
[2:54:50.960 --> 2:54:54.880]  look i was having an incredible conversation too with the european union
[2:54:54.880 --> 2:54:59.440]  member of parliament godfrey bloom i didn't know
[2:54:59.440 --> 2:55:03.440]  that they were exempt from tax during the break i googled it there was mainstream
[2:55:03.440 --> 2:55:07.680]  news he told me that the european union bureaucrats
[2:55:07.680 --> 2:55:13.520]  that that the average brit doesn't even know this then he went further
[2:55:13.520 --> 2:55:19.200]  explaining this to me continue sir yeah they don't pay any tax they pay a
[2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:22.720]  standard basic rate of tax which is something a minimal amount like 10
[2:55:22.720 --> 2:55:25.840]  percent it's a token amount they don't pay any
[2:55:25.840 --> 2:55:29.680]  um any sales tax as you call it over there when they buy a new car
[2:55:29.680 --> 2:55:33.680]  which is 20 percent so their new Mercedes is 20 percent cheaper than anybody
[2:55:33.680 --> 2:55:36.720]  else's uh so they they're always voting for big
[2:55:36.720 --> 2:55:40.800]  government they're voting for more tax they're voting for more spending and yet
[2:55:40.800 --> 2:55:46.000]  they don't contribute to any of this well our founders went to war over
[2:55:46.000 --> 2:55:48.960]  taxation without representation you already have that because they're
[2:55:48.960 --> 2:55:52.960]  unelected but this is even worse they are openly
[2:55:52.960 --> 2:55:58.080]  do as i say not as i do i mean that is that is tyranny i mean it doesn't get
[2:55:58.080 --> 2:56:02.160]  any more bona fide than that it's interesting you made a point
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:04.960]  earlier elix about the east europeans you know
[2:56:04.960 --> 2:56:08.640]  some of the east europeans who weren't part of the communist regime
[2:56:08.640 --> 2:56:12.880]  the ordinary the ordinary working people in places like poland of the check
[2:56:12.880 --> 2:56:16.080]  republic and suddenly beginning to realize
[2:56:16.080 --> 2:56:19.920]  what they've stepped into and and it was the check president
[2:56:19.920 --> 2:56:25.040]  president claus on his outgoing speech uh in the parliament said you know i know
[2:56:25.040 --> 2:56:28.480]  all about this i i i i went to prison under the
[2:56:28.480 --> 2:56:32.640]  soviet regime and what we're seeing is a soviet regime
[2:56:32.640 --> 2:56:36.880]  the european union is totally modeled on the soviet system
[2:56:36.880 --> 2:56:42.000]  uh it isn't modeled on the united states people are being told in western europe
[2:56:42.000 --> 2:56:46.560]  that the european union is basically the basic pattern is the united states it's
[2:56:46.560 --> 2:56:50.480]  nothing of the sort it's the soviet union and all these things i've been
[2:56:50.480 --> 2:56:53.840]  talking about today prove it do they're not
[2:56:53.840 --> 2:56:57.520]  and for those that haven't studied this parliamentary setup in the bureaucracy
[2:56:57.520 --> 2:57:01.920]  it really is set up like the poet bureau it really is set up to do whatever it
[2:57:01.920 --> 2:57:05.360]  wants whenever it wants it really is dictatorial and now
[2:57:05.360 --> 2:57:08.560]  they're saying they have eu arrest warrants and obama
[2:57:08.560 --> 2:57:13.280]  has amended the inner pole agreement to allow them to do basically whatever they
[2:57:13.280 --> 2:57:17.120]  want inside the united states
[2:57:17.120 --> 2:57:22.960]  if the european arrest warrant uh well if if if if somebody says stay in austria
[2:57:22.960 --> 2:57:25.760]  for example that they don't like gypsies and that's
[2:57:25.760 --> 2:57:29.120]  considered to be xenophobia under the austrian law
[2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:33.440]  they can arrest you when you go home with a european arrest warrant
[2:57:33.440 --> 2:57:36.960]  they don't need a they don't need a magistrates warrant they don't need a
[2:57:36.960 --> 2:57:41.120]  primer face a case they do no concept of habeas corpus
[2:57:41.120 --> 2:57:45.280]  so they can arrest you a foreigner can arrest you he can take you to austria
[2:57:45.280 --> 2:57:49.520]  they can imprison you without charge for as long as they like
[2:57:49.520 --> 2:57:53.200]  and this happened to an englishman only about three months ago
[2:57:53.200 --> 2:57:56.240]  and people were saying how on earth could this happen and it's happened
[2:57:56.240 --> 2:58:00.240]  because nobody knows about it there's a deliberate disinformation
[2:58:00.240 --> 2:58:04.640]  and most of it stems from our own bbc our own british broadcasting
[2:58:04.640 --> 2:58:08.880]  uh service which had such a wonderful representation in the war and post war
[2:58:08.880 --> 2:58:13.600]  has now been taken over by these people uh and so people just don't know and of
[2:58:13.600 --> 2:58:17.200]  course information and so this uh uh uh starling said
[2:58:17.200 --> 2:58:21.280]  knowledge is power and if people don't have the knowledge and they won't find
[2:58:21.280 --> 2:58:24.560]  it in the newspapers and they won't find it on bbc
[2:58:24.560 --> 2:58:28.000]  they're going to have to work to find it but it's not that difficult you just
[2:58:28.000 --> 2:58:32.400]  have to make an effort well he's an economist he's a member of the european
[2:58:32.400 --> 2:58:36.000]  union parliament he's god-free bloom look forward to speaking to you again in

[3:01:00.960 --> 3:01:05.680]  that uh she had uh elinsky
[3:01:05.680 --> 3:01:11.120]  hillary brought elinsky to the wesley in january 69 to speak at a private
[3:01:11.120 --> 3:01:14.560]  dinner for a dozen students and it goes on to how they
[3:01:14.560 --> 3:01:18.960]  expressed how much they loved communism together
[3:01:18.960 --> 3:01:23.280]  and this is actually uh reading hillary clinton's hidden thesis
[3:01:23.280 --> 3:01:30.080]  msnbc may 9th elinsky offered hillary a job as community organizer
[3:01:30.080 --> 3:01:33.520]  see when you hear community organizing see this thing's been floating around
[3:01:33.520 --> 3:01:37.600]  because government worshipers of communism get to read it as their bible
[3:01:37.600 --> 3:01:40.640]  and then they tell you oh there's no communism
[3:01:40.640 --> 3:01:44.720]  oh yeah the government take over a health care obama spending more than all
[3:01:44.720 --> 3:01:47.920]  presidents before him combined in less than a year
[3:01:47.920 --> 3:01:54.160]  there's no communism well there isn't communism in the way you were taught
[3:01:54.160 --> 3:01:58.400]  loving people that want to share yeah and black uniforms want to rape your wife
[3:01:58.400 --> 3:02:01.600]  and daughters and to put you in a slave camp
[3:02:01.600 --> 3:02:05.840]  that's all they are slave camp runners
[3:02:05.840 --> 3:02:08.640]  we got tarpoli coming on this week by the way already what what days he set up
[3:02:08.640 --> 3:02:13.440]  for thursday one o'clock give us a year in a review
[3:02:13.440 --> 3:02:18.160]  looking into trends next year we got salente tomorrow right
[3:02:18.160 --> 3:02:22.000]  all right here's the deal i said i'd go to calls

[3:02:36.640 --> 3:02:41.600]  news blitz to the end of the show recap the uh
[3:02:41.600 --> 3:02:46.880]  underwear bomber and all of that uh the uh
[3:02:46.880 --> 3:02:51.040]  u.n being given expanded diplomatic community in the u.s through their
[3:02:51.040 --> 3:02:58.480]  power arm interpole so that is coming up today
[3:02:58.480 --> 3:03:02.400]  after i take some of your phone calls in fact right now let's go to
[3:03:02.400 --> 3:03:08.720]  mike in new york you're on the air mike go ahead
[3:03:10.560 --> 3:03:16.320]  um yeah go ahead buddy okay sir i have a question for you um what you were
[3:03:16.320 --> 3:03:20.800]  talking about earlier now obviously in the movement in the united states we
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:25.840]  obviously have the majority of the citizens but as you mentioned earlier
[3:03:25.840 --> 3:03:29.360]  the elite just keep doing whatever they want
[3:03:29.360 --> 3:03:32.800]  and i know that there's uh a state while amassing
[3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:37.200]  physical implements of force against us yes
[3:03:37.200 --> 3:03:42.240]  go ahead right right right so as far as american people are concerned
[3:03:42.240 --> 3:03:47.840]  um we are at a point of a mass strike movement and we have been that yes we
[3:03:47.840 --> 3:03:53.200]  are in a captured country we are in an occupied nation there's no doubt
[3:03:53.200 --> 3:03:57.040]  right right so uh mike what i wanted you to talk about a little bit is just and
[3:03:57.040 --> 3:04:00.560]  this is the last thing i wanted you to do was just to talk about the state
[3:04:00.560 --> 3:04:04.800]  movement and our progress on that as you see it sir and that's it thank you
[3:04:04.800 --> 3:04:10.720]  god bless you i appreciate the call mike what's happening is the media the adl
[3:04:10.720 --> 3:04:16.560]  the republicans are trying to demonize the state sovereignty movement
[3:04:16.560 --> 3:04:20.400]  and they have rick perry come out and say i want republica texas we're going to
[3:04:20.400 --> 3:04:24.880]  secede and later he says oh i was just joking in a press release
[3:04:24.880 --> 3:04:28.080]  so they're trying to make us look like we're revolutionaries that want to
[3:04:28.080 --> 3:04:31.760]  secede when we want the federal government that's been
[3:04:31.760 --> 3:04:35.920]  captured by offshore illegitimate interests to get off our backs and
[3:04:35.920 --> 3:04:39.680]  follow the bill of rights and constitution so over 30 states are
[3:04:39.680 --> 3:04:44.320]  declaring sovereignty declaring tenth amendment and ninth amendment powers
[3:04:44.320 --> 3:04:48.640]  and that is one of our biggest ace in the holes the problem is
[3:04:48.640 --> 3:04:53.200]  the bankers through the feds have already bankrupted most the states
[3:04:53.200 --> 3:04:57.600]  to try to make them be dependent we have to get to the state houses
[3:04:57.600 --> 3:05:01.120]  and get the word out and let them know they have the people support resisting
[3:05:01.120 --> 3:05:04.560]  this this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[3:05:04.560 --> 3:05:07.440]  solar power generator number one new climate
[3:05:07.440 --> 3:05:10.320]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[3:05:10.320 --> 3:05:14.560]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[3:05:14.560 --> 3:05:18.160]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[3:05:18.160 --> 3:05:21.680]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[3:05:21.680 --> 3:05:25.360]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[3:05:25.360 --> 3:05:28.320]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[3:05:28.320 --> 3:05:32.160]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[3:05:32.160 --> 3:05:35.360]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[3:05:35.360 --> 3:05:39.280]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[3:05:39.280 --> 3:05:42.160]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[3:05:42.160 --> 3:05:45.040]  folks i really believe in the solar powered generators offered by solution
[3:05:45.040 --> 3:05:48.720]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[3:05:48.720 --> 3:05:53.200]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[3:05:53.200 --> 3:05:57.280]  remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[3:05:57.280 --> 3:06:02.640]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[3:06:03.040 --> 3:06:06.320]  hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs
[3:06:06.320 --> 3:06:10.160]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[3:06:10.160 --> 3:06:13.200]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[3:06:13.200 --> 3:06:17.200]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[3:06:17.200 --> 3:06:20.480]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses
[3:06:20.480 --> 3:06:23.920]  the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[3:06:23.920 --> 3:06:28.320]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers
[3:06:28.320 --> 3:06:31.920]  the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[3:06:31.920 --> 3:06:36.000]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:39.520]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[3:06:39.520 --> 3:06:44.000]  with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step by step instructions
[3:06:44.000 --> 3:06:46.960]  are provided making production fast and simple
[3:06:46.960 --> 3:06:52.320]  go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[3:06:52.320 --> 3:06:59.280]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[3:06:59.280 --> 3:07:06.320]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[3:07:06.320 --> 3:07:09.520]  this is our last chance to not relive history
[3:07:09.520 --> 3:07:13.520]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[3:07:13.520 --> 3:07:16.720]  americans at home i've turned a tremendous influence
[3:07:16.720 --> 3:07:20.800]  on our president and congress and they really are calling the shots
[3:07:20.800 --> 3:07:26.000]  i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:29.920]  full of the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[3:07:29.920 --> 3:07:33.600]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[3:07:33.600 --> 3:07:36.000]  and on its ashes constructing world government
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:07:39.920]  tim geithner, bernanke and arsonists they're asking for more matches
[3:07:39.920 --> 3:07:42.400]  and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to
[3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:46.800]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc
[3:07:46.800 --> 3:07:52.000]  we have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of full of the republic on
[3:07:52.000 --> 3:07:57.040]  dvd at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super
[3:07:57.040 --> 3:08:01.680]  high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[3:08:03.280 --> 3:08:07.360]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines
[3:08:07.360 --> 3:08:11.120]  the information war continues it's alex jones
[3:08:11.120 --> 3:08:15.040]  and the gcn radio network
[3:08:15.040 --> 3:08:22.160]  well the health care bill is going to be
[3:08:22.160 --> 3:08:27.440]  going into conference committee set to be passed the next few weeks
[3:08:27.440 --> 3:08:32.800]  also the federal government can run out of money by january first obama's saying
[3:08:32.800 --> 3:08:37.600]  if congress doesn't pass a increase of the debt ceiling by several trillion
[3:08:37.600 --> 3:08:41.920]  dollars a year the way the media spends it is
[3:08:41.920 --> 3:08:46.160]  what's just due that day a few hundred billion
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:52.640]  it's just unbelievable and so they're going to threaten to shut the
[3:08:52.640 --> 3:08:57.040]  government down if the health care isn't
[3:08:57.040 --> 3:09:01.120]  rammed through people better contact that conference committee
[3:09:01.120 --> 3:09:03.680]  they better call the democratic party leadership
[3:09:03.680 --> 3:09:08.080]  there are democrats exiting the sinking ship but the bigger issue is
[3:09:08.080 --> 3:09:12.640]  when republicans get in a year and take control of the house
[3:09:12.640 --> 3:09:17.040]  or they get control of the senate in the next few years
[3:09:17.040 --> 3:09:20.480]  we need to be able to repeal this government takeover of health care
[3:09:20.480 --> 3:09:25.520]  but you watch the republicans aren't going to do it
[3:09:25.520 --> 3:09:30.400]  because they want big government too the leadership does now
[3:09:30.400 --> 3:09:34.640]  there's some evidence though that they're afraid of a real revolution
[3:09:34.640 --> 3:09:40.560]  a peaceful revolution through the republican party and that's why
[3:09:40.560 --> 3:09:46.080]  they've put in the bill that another two-thirds majority
[3:09:46.080 --> 3:09:52.080]  is needed in the house or a super majority what 60 plus percent
[3:09:52.080 --> 3:10:00.240]  in the senate 60 or more to be able to repeal any of this
[3:10:00.240 --> 3:10:05.600]  so they are really trying to put the screws down
[3:10:05.600 --> 3:10:12.480]  and make more people dependent and take over more of health care
[3:10:12.480 --> 3:10:17.280]  i wanted to play congressman bachas here
[3:10:17.280 --> 3:10:21.360]  drunkenly on the floor last week chastising people
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:25.120]  on the other side of the aisle who need to get behind the government takeover
[3:10:25.120 --> 3:10:27.680]  of health care here it is
[3:10:27.680 --> 3:10:30.800]  and i asked the senator where is the senator on that side of the aisle
[3:10:30.800 --> 3:10:35.280]  who's got the courage to break from their leadership
[3:10:35.280 --> 3:10:39.680]  a great break for the partisanship there's an exercise in the south aisle
[3:10:39.680 --> 3:10:43.920]  to work together to pass health care reform i asked where is the where is
[3:10:43.920 --> 3:10:47.280]  the where is the courage where the senator's got courage in that side of
[3:10:47.280 --> 3:10:50.960]  the aisle to stand up and work together in a bipartisan basis to get health
[3:10:50.960 --> 3:10:56.000]  care reform passed where we on this side reached out our
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:10:59.360]  hands for a bipartisan agreement on health care forum
[3:10:59.360 --> 3:11:04.560]  probably to a fault probably to a fault and i say fault because for
[3:11:04.560 --> 3:11:08.880]  months and months and much this time anyway stand the hand of work with
[3:11:08.880 --> 3:11:12.240]  other senators like i said i'm a person basis i know that
[3:11:12.240 --> 3:11:16.640]  the chair very much knows that he watched this he saw it happen
[3:11:16.640 --> 3:11:20.160]  in the finance committee and senator grassley and i worked very hard to get
[3:11:20.160 --> 3:11:22.880]  centers on both sides now to work to pass health care
[3:11:22.880 --> 3:11:28.160]  reform
[3:11:28.160 --> 3:11:31.760]  uh... approach the group of six three public
[3:11:31.760 --> 3:11:35.920]  democrats we work for days we work for months
[3:11:35.920 --> 3:11:39.120]  on a bipartisan basis to get health care reform passed you know what happened
[3:11:39.120 --> 3:11:43.760]  i watched it happen in those centers there in the room we're actually very
[3:11:43.760 --> 3:11:47.440]  good thing you're not watching prison planet dot tv you can't see his body
[3:11:47.440 --> 3:11:51.280]  language health care reform i mean he is wrong questions there as the
[3:11:51.280 --> 3:11:53.840]  for example for me very very good questions
[3:11:53.840 --> 3:11:57.280]  or anything no that's very good questions
[3:11:57.280 --> 3:12:01.120]  of senator grassley has very good thank you for your question
[3:12:01.120 --> 3:12:04.320]  but you know what happened you don't have this president you don't have you don't
[3:12:04.320 --> 3:12:07.680]  have one by one by one they started drift away
[3:12:07.680 --> 3:12:12.560]  they wanted to pass health care reform they wanted to act in a bipartisan basis
[3:12:12.560 --> 3:12:17.600]  but they were pressured pressured for the outs from their political party not to
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:21.440]  do it not to do it not to do it why are they
[3:12:21.440 --> 3:12:24.640]  pressured but now they're not that's the key into the project
[3:12:24.640 --> 3:12:28.960]  because their leadership what a political flavor
[3:12:28.960 --> 3:12:32.640]  well once there the party is totally drunk look at him pointing out
[3:12:32.640 --> 3:12:35.760]  health care is waterloo they do not want to work with us
[3:12:35.760 --> 3:12:39.280]  that's how the aisle they did not want to work with us because they're like so
[3:12:39.280 --> 3:12:43.440]  drunkard thie couple of statements it's hard not to watch that
[3:12:43.440 --> 3:12:47.280]  i mean for people that aren't watching a prison planet dot tv or just listening
[3:12:47.280 --> 3:12:51.440]  the radio. You got to go up to info wars.com and prisonpana.com. We got the video linked.
[3:12:52.320 --> 3:12:57.200]  He is just completely drunk off of his gourd. I mean, you can hear it in the audio, but when
[3:12:57.200 --> 3:12:59.360]  you're watching the video, he's kind of stumbling around and
[3:13:07.600 --> 3:13:11.600]  I mean, he definitely probably has had at least 10 whiskies there. He is from Montana.
[3:13:12.480 --> 3:13:16.480]  Montana has a lot of great people out there, but what are they doing having that communist as
[3:13:16.480 --> 3:13:25.200]  their senator? Get rid of him. I'm sick of these people. All right, let's talk to Rick in Texas.
[3:13:25.200 --> 3:13:29.760]  Rick here on the air. Go ahead. Hello, Alex. Thanks for having me on. Hey, buddy.
[3:13:30.560 --> 3:13:33.760]  Hey, uh, see, I just heard you talking to that last caller about physical
[3:13:33.760 --> 3:13:39.360]  implements of force. Say, uh, I had been trying to get through to you and believe it or not,
[3:13:39.360 --> 3:13:42.880]  I had sent some emails to you and I'm going to have to talk to somebody off the air, but I do
[3:13:42.880 --> 3:13:47.280]  have some information you may want to let everybody else or make everybody else aware of.
[3:13:47.840 --> 3:13:52.080]  Well, just tell us what is it? Well, uh, a couple of months ago,
[3:13:52.080 --> 3:13:55.920]  we're down on the border and we noticed a couple of buddies called me and they said that there were
[3:13:55.920 --> 3:14:02.000]  some, uh, some helicopters, uh, at the international airport. And we had a patchy helicopters,
[3:14:02.000 --> 3:14:07.920]  RAF, Medevac, and a couple of other helicopters. So you need to understand, we can see the
[3:14:07.920 --> 3:14:13.680]  Mexican border from our front doorstep and we can see the international airport. And we saw,
[3:14:14.400 --> 3:14:20.160]  uh, RAF helicopters, uh, marine helicopters and army helicopters openly and freely going
[3:14:20.160 --> 3:14:26.960]  into Mexico back and forth. Yeah, you better believe that those are probably drug shipments.
[3:14:27.760 --> 3:14:35.120]  But I mean, I have the FEMA press release in LA09. I mean, I've seen scores of news articles over
[3:14:35.120 --> 3:14:45.040]  the years. We, we show a bunch of them in road to tyranny, my film 2002, where they have openly
[3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:52.080]  signed deals to use foreign troops in America. And now they're openly have the Marine Corps and army
[3:14:52.080 --> 3:14:57.760]  running checkpoints all over the country, but they just do it incrementally to acclimate everyone
[3:14:57.760 --> 3:15:04.080]  and we'll see. So the army's running checkpoints. So the army was at the Kentucky Derby stopping
[3:15:04.080 --> 3:15:09.600]  drunks. Again, they're just conditioning everybody. What do you think the helicopters were doing down
[3:15:09.600 --> 3:15:15.600]  there? To be absolutely honest with you, none of us know, but I did approach the airport. I did call
[3:15:15.600 --> 3:15:20.640]  a couple of people up there and they said that they were training Cessnas. I did call a couple of
[3:15:20.640 --> 3:15:26.000]  news agencies in San Antonio and they were stopped in Brackerville by a military police and turned
[3:15:26.000 --> 3:15:36.080]  around. Hold on. San Antonio media was turned around where? As far as I heard from San Antonio
[3:15:36.080 --> 3:15:40.080]  media, they said they were turned around about 30 miles away in Brackerville by military police
[3:15:40.080 --> 3:15:49.600]  from Laughlin. Well, all I know is that the governor six months ago said no to Homeland
[3:15:49.600 --> 3:15:56.240]  Security, Army, Navy, Marine Corp, Air Force, MPs. It was in the newspapers there. We wrote
[3:15:56.240 --> 3:16:00.080]  articles about it and linked to it. We had a state rep on people want to pull that up
[3:16:01.040 --> 3:16:06.720]  and the governor said you can't do these illegal checkpoints and the military went ahead and did
[3:16:06.720 --> 3:16:13.920]  it. Went ahead and did it. And so I mean, I believe almost anything anymore. We'll shoot
[3:16:13.920 --> 3:16:20.560]  some video of it. Get it up on YouTube. I've got video. I've got a I've got pictures but no this
[3:16:20.560 --> 3:16:25.520]  Alex is we've tried to send them through your to your site several times five to six different
[3:16:25.520 --> 3:16:30.800]  people and we can't get it through what I mean. There's a media blackout of 200 miles between
[3:16:31.360 --> 3:16:35.600]  Austin and the border. There's really a media blackout. We can't get to you. The first time
[3:16:35.600 --> 3:16:40.480]  I'm speaking now is probably because I'm about 50 miles away from me. Well, you think they've got
[3:16:40.480 --> 3:16:46.080]  some kind of computer system that tracks anybody locally from calling this show or blocks email
[3:16:46.080 --> 3:16:51.200]  in the area? Well, listen, I'm going to put you on hold. I'm going to give you one of our internal
[3:16:51.200 --> 3:16:57.200]  emails and send it. Okay, or I'll get your phone number. How's that sound because I want to see
[3:16:57.200 --> 3:17:01.280]  this. Yeah, you're going to want to talk to me know that I'm local law enforcement, but I won't
[3:17:01.280 --> 3:17:07.840]  see what branch and because I don't want them to, you know, Oh, really? Oh, okay. So, so, so, so,
[3:17:07.840 --> 3:17:12.880]  so you're some type of peace officer down there. You're very close.
[3:17:14.640 --> 3:17:18.880]  You're very close and we have federal agents working with state agencies and we also do have
[3:17:18.880 --> 3:17:22.480]  U.S. military within the United States Border Patrol working there as well.
[3:17:24.400 --> 3:17:27.200]  And so there's there's British aircraft down there.
[3:17:28.160 --> 3:17:33.680]  RAF Medavex. Yep. And people that are piloting these aircrafts. I like to let me add they're not
[3:17:33.680 --> 3:17:39.920]  not in pilots uniforms. They look like your typical college kid out of UT. They're wearing cargo pants
[3:17:39.920 --> 3:17:46.160]  and T shirts and not one of them has a flight suit on all these all these vehicles. They do appear
[3:17:46.160 --> 3:17:53.120]  to be armed. Well, I'll tell you now that makes sense. If you are a police officer or a sheriff's
[3:17:53.120 --> 3:17:58.000]  deputy, now it makes sense that of course, if they're running a security operation, they do
[3:17:58.000 --> 3:18:02.960]  have programs they can put in place to block certain emails with certain keywords. I have
[3:18:02.960 --> 3:18:07.360]  read about things like that going on. Wow, this must be a really important operation if they're
[3:18:07.360 --> 3:18:14.880]  doing stuff like that. So, well, I mean, I've got national level exercise 09 right here.
[3:18:16.080 --> 3:18:21.520]  And it openly states that all these troops from foreign countries and intelligence agencies
[3:18:22.080 --> 3:18:29.520]  training to deal with American terrorists. But are the police in your area starting to wake up
[3:18:29.520 --> 3:18:34.640]  seeing these foreign assets? We are seeing it and there's plenty of us that have seen it. And
[3:18:34.640 --> 3:18:39.280]  maybe you well, I'll notify you that. But as far as I know, Texas peace officers right now are
[3:18:39.280 --> 3:18:44.560]  being mandated to go over a chemical biological and nuclear warfare and chemical nuclear and
[3:18:44.560 --> 3:18:49.280]  biological threats within the larger cities. Now, to be absolutely honest with you, I don't
[3:18:49.280 --> 3:18:57.120]  believe that a street cop is capable or has the capabilities due to to even be
[3:18:57.120 --> 3:19:04.880]  any help in a situation like that. Well, that's just a test to test your federalization. That's
[3:19:04.880 --> 3:19:11.520]  a federal muster. I mean, all the big departments we've seen under executive order under FEMA funding
[3:19:12.960 --> 3:19:19.920]  have been hardening their facilities, preparing for disasters, preparing for attack. Have you
[3:19:19.920 --> 3:19:25.440]  seen that in your area? Yes, sir. Absolutely. Like I said, when you see the information that I got
[3:19:25.440 --> 3:19:30.400]  and how difficult it was for us to get through to you, I'm going to be absolutely honest to you,
[3:19:30.400 --> 3:19:35.680]  Mr. Jones. We actually thought that you were sending or your outfit was sending information to
[3:19:35.680 --> 3:19:40.960]  them because we've actually had federal agents come to us already and asked us to stop and they
[3:19:40.960 --> 3:19:47.280]  did attack our second amendment also. What? Hold on. I got to talk to you. Hold on. I got to talk
[3:19:47.280 --> 3:19:53.360]  to you during the break. This is getting crazier by the minute. Rick from, I guess, South Texas
[3:19:53.360 --> 3:19:59.840]  calling us. I'll tell you this. We're not in Kansas anymore, ladies and gentlemen. We're not in
[3:19:59.840 --> 3:20:06.880]  Kansas anymore. We'll be right back. This is an emergency alert. People don't die of H1N1 infection.

[3:21:03.120 --> 3:21:09.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to not
[3:21:09.280 --> 3:21:14.960]  relive history. Is it finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans
[3:21:14.960 --> 3:21:20.880]  at home? I have determined its influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[3:21:20.880 --> 3:21:27.360]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention. Full of the
[3:21:27.360 --> 3:21:33.680]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying
[3:21:33.680 --> 3:21:39.200]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[3:21:39.200 --> 3:21:43.280]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[3:21:43.280 --> 3:21:49.600]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the

[3:24:20.640 --> 3:24:41.760]  Okay, I'm gonna get to your calls near the end of the show. I just ended up spending most of a
[3:24:41.760 --> 3:24:46.160]  segment with that one caller because it was such interesting information. He's trying to send us
[3:24:46.160 --> 3:24:57.280]  the photos right now. On the subject of Interpol, I have read the executive order and what this did
[3:24:57.280 --> 3:25:04.800]  was amend an executive order by Ronald Reagan that did not give immunity to Interpol and it gave full
[3:25:04.800 --> 3:25:14.240]  immunity to Interpol. Interpol set up after World War II by the U.S. and England involved in
[3:25:14.240 --> 3:25:19.360]  narcotics trafficking. Everywhere you go in England, they ask for your name and address and social
[3:25:19.360 --> 3:25:24.480]  security number. It's put in a database at all hotels. Everywhere you go, you're tracked. The
[3:25:24.480 --> 3:25:30.160]  Interpol system has now been adopted here for at least 20 years. They've had police and military
[3:25:30.160 --> 3:25:35.760]  exchange programs where our police get sent over to foreign countries. Their police get sent over
[3:25:35.760 --> 3:25:42.080]  here and they're now setting up a system under the EU arrest warrant and other systems where they
[3:25:42.080 --> 3:25:48.400]  can come here and arrest U.S. citizens and take them to foreign countries to be tried. And you
[3:25:48.400 --> 3:25:54.720]  just heard a European Union member of parliament breaking this down on the last hour. Now, there
[3:25:54.720 --> 3:26:02.720]  are a bunch of news stories on this, but the best thing to read is Threats Watch. That's a link at
[3:26:02.720 --> 3:26:11.440]  the end of the article from National Review. And there's another article here that's important to
[3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:22.400]  read. That is out of another publication, the new media journal.us, the fifth column.
[3:26:23.120 --> 3:26:30.080]  President Barack Obama has issued an amendment to executive order 12,425, designating the International
[3:26:30.080 --> 3:26:35.520]  Law Enforcement Agency Interpol as a public international organization, thus extending
[3:26:35.520 --> 3:26:42.240]  diplomatic immunity to the law enforcement group. The amendment to the executive order,
[3:26:42.240 --> 3:26:47.280]  which does not need to be put to the senatorial test of advice and consent reads,
[3:26:48.880 --> 3:26:53.360]  by the authority vested in me as president by the Constitution and the laws of the United
[3:26:53.360 --> 3:26:57.920]  States of America, including section one of the International Organization Immunities Act,
[3:26:57.920 --> 3:27:07.040]  22 USC 288. And in order to extend the appropriate privileges, exemptions, and amenities to the
[3:27:07.040 --> 3:27:13.680]  International Criminal Police Operation Interpol, it is hereby ordered that executive order 12,425
[3:27:14.800 --> 3:27:21.440]  of June 16, 1983 as amended is further amended by deleting from the first sentence the words
[3:27:21.440 --> 3:27:31.440]  except those provided by section 23, section 456 of the act and semicolon that immediately
[3:27:31.440 --> 3:27:36.720]  precedes them. And those were the areas that Ronald Reagan signed, and you can zoom in right here
[3:27:36.720 --> 3:27:42.880]  actually on the subsection of the executive order. Those are the areas saying they were
[3:27:42.880 --> 3:27:51.040]  still open to search and seizure and still had to show papers. The text of section two,
[3:27:51.040 --> 3:27:56.960]  which applies to Interpol states, see property and assets of international organizations,
[3:27:56.960 --> 3:28:04.160]  whether located and by whosoever held shall be immune from search unless such immunity
[3:28:04.160 --> 3:28:11.520]  be expressly waived and for confiscation. The archives and international organizations shall be
[3:28:11.520 --> 3:28:21.360]  inviolable or inviolate. Now, that means just like our rights were once inviolate,
[3:28:22.320 --> 3:28:30.400]  inalienable. Now, the arguments by the White House are, hey, the UN's already got immunity.
[3:28:30.400 --> 3:28:34.880]  Yeah, let's take it from there. It's kind of like they say, hey, we've been thumbprinting you
[3:28:34.880 --> 3:28:39.440]  to get a driver's license nationwide for the last 10 years at least. What's wrong with us
[3:28:39.440 --> 3:28:44.240]  making you thumbprint to buy and sell now? The government's already got your fingerprints
[3:28:45.120 --> 3:28:50.160]  or the government already took your baby's blood at birth in the last 37 years if you
[3:28:50.160 --> 3:28:54.240]  were born in a hospital. What's wrong with them using it for medical experiments?
[3:28:56.720 --> 3:29:03.440]  Oh, well, here is the statesman.com. Texas had destroyed baby blood taken without consent
[3:29:03.440 --> 3:29:10.160]  because of lawsuits. They tried to buffalo these people, but they went ahead and sued.
[3:29:10.160 --> 3:29:15.760]  This is criminal. Texas happens to hold the DNA for the entire United States,
[3:29:15.760 --> 3:29:20.880]  but this is a UN operation. Told you about that 14 years ago. Give me a close shot of that.
[3:29:22.800 --> 3:29:27.280]  The point is, people are in denial out there. The denial has to end.
[3:29:27.280 --> 3:29:37.040]  This stuff is going on. I'm going to finish up with Interpol, with the UN. Who made these guys
[3:29:37.040 --> 3:29:46.960]  God? Who made them all above the law? Okay, who made them King? We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[3:29:46.960 --> 3:29:55.200]  We're talking about sovereign immunity. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[3:29:55.200 --> 3:29:58.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:02.240 --> 3:30:06.960]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[3:30:06.960 --> 3:30:11.840]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all
[3:30:11.840 --> 3:30:17.680]  I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[3:30:17.680 --> 3:30:22.960]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[3:30:22.960 --> 3:30:27.600]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[3:30:27.600 --> 3:30:32.160]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[3:30:32.160 --> 3:30:36.880]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[3:30:36.880 --> 3:30:42.320]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't
[3:30:42.320 --> 3:30:47.680]  know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live

[3:33:16.720 --> 3:33:29.760]  I remember receiving video of Cooperative Nugget 94, 95, 96 of foreign trips
[3:33:30.640 --> 3:33:39.280]  training to take on American citizens. And this was on the video. And then I went to
[3:33:39.280 --> 3:33:44.800]  urban warfare drills all over the United States. I had listeners send me footage all over
[3:33:44.800 --> 3:33:55.280]  the country of foreign troops running drills to take over U.S. cities. And they would admit
[3:33:55.280 --> 3:34:01.200]  it was for the United States. They would do mock interrogations of where did you get the
[3:34:01.200 --> 3:34:05.040]  weapon? Where did you get the helmet? Where are you from? I'm from San Francisco.
[3:34:05.040 --> 3:34:20.320]  And I shot video of this and put it in police state 2000. And people thought I hired the Coronado
[3:34:20.320 --> 3:34:25.920]  troopship and they thought I hired hovercraft and they thought that I had some 50 million
[3:34:25.920 --> 3:34:32.560]  dollar budget and it was fake because in 1999 people knew foreign troops in America was tyranny.
[3:34:32.560 --> 3:34:38.960]  Just like back in the 90s we'd show a government document where they planned to condition the
[3:34:38.960 --> 3:34:44.800]  public to get the public ready for implantable microchips and people would get freaked out by
[3:34:44.800 --> 3:34:49.680]  it. Now they're like, yeah, I've seen 100 newscasts saying we'll all get chips and the different
[3:34:49.680 --> 3:34:53.600]  government officials have had to take it in different countries and that old people are
[3:34:53.600 --> 3:34:59.120]  going to be getting them in prisoners. What's wrong with that? I'm comfortable with it. I've
[3:34:59.120 --> 3:35:13.120]  been acclimated. And then in 2000, 2001, I would see Washington Post articles and Toronto Star
[3:35:13.120 --> 3:35:18.720]  articles and I put them in police state II the takeover and police state III total enslavement
[3:35:18.720 --> 3:35:25.520]  and 911 the road to tyranny. I mean, we have the actual Washington Post and actual Toronto Star
[3:35:25.520 --> 3:35:32.240]  headlines saying US signs deal with Mexico and Canada to fight terror. Our armies are training.
[3:35:33.200 --> 3:35:43.600]  Then two years ago, members of the US Senate and House actually wrote letters to Bush asking,
[3:35:43.600 --> 3:35:49.280]  what's going on with the SPP deals have been signed between the Mexican and Canadian military
[3:35:49.280 --> 3:35:56.080]  to be involved domestically on US soil and we weren't involved in Congress.
[3:35:57.120 --> 3:36:01.120]  Remember the Mexican troops and Dutch troops being brought in for Katrina?
[3:36:03.120 --> 3:36:06.080]  In fact, people don't believe that Google Mexican troops Katrina.
[3:36:08.160 --> 3:36:14.960]  In fact, YouTube it will show people a YouTube video for the first time since 1868.
[3:36:14.960 --> 3:36:20.880]  Mexican troops enter the US giant Mexican flags flying. It's all about setting the precedent.
[3:36:23.680 --> 3:36:28.720]  Then you learn that the biggest Army Navy Marine Corps recruiting centers are in Manila,
[3:36:28.720 --> 3:36:37.760]  Philippines, Mexico City, Mexico, areas of Ukraine. Oh, Mexican troops a Katrina efforts Fox News,
[3:36:37.760 --> 3:36:44.960]  Laredo, Texas, a Mexican convoy began crossing in the United States on Thursday to bring aid to
[3:36:44.960 --> 3:36:56.160]  victims of Hurricane Katrina. Oh, I'm sorry. I knew it was a six 1846 I said 1868 or 18 something
[3:36:56.160 --> 3:37:02.960]  point is 1846. It's the the convoy bound for San Antonio was the first Mexican military unit
[3:37:02.960 --> 3:37:09.520]  to operate on US soil since 1846. See, this is all being done to acclimate you where it sounds
[3:37:09.520 --> 3:37:15.280]  reasonable. Remember, I got interviews with Army officers Marine Corps officers.
[3:37:16.000 --> 3:37:21.760]  One is in road to tyranny about how they were doing secret gun confiscation operations in
[3:37:21.760 --> 3:37:34.400]  Norfolk, Virginia and other places in the late 1980s. Now for PR purposes, you hear Oh, in Texas
[3:37:34.400 --> 3:37:42.560]  and in California and in Arizona and in New York State and in Florida, the National Guard,
[3:37:42.560 --> 3:37:49.600]  the regular Army, the Marine Corps are going to be helping at football games and the Kentucky Derby
[3:37:49.600 --> 3:37:57.520]  and the NFL Super Bowl and to stop drunk drivers and with the jaws of life Army Times reported.
[3:38:00.240 --> 3:38:05.520]  Oh, well, you of course the armies here and suddenly there's army ads everywhere
[3:38:05.520 --> 3:38:11.280]  and ads everywhere thanking the troops as they cut their health care benefits. It's all do what the
[3:38:11.280 --> 3:38:16.400]  military says or you're not pro America. The military now will run your life and that's so the
[3:38:16.400 --> 3:38:21.520]  military hears it and gets acclimated. It's so the population gets acclimated. We are being
[3:38:21.520 --> 3:38:37.600]  conditioned to accept this. Now let me just go over a few articles I've seen in the last week on this.
[3:38:40.640 --> 3:38:45.920]  It's bad enough to have foreign troops in all these countless drills. What earlier this year
[3:38:45.920 --> 3:38:54.320]  troops from 11 Latin American countries landed in Florida type Latin American troops land in
[3:38:54.320 --> 3:38:59.840]  Florida. I want people to see that. There's video of that. Latin American troops land in Florida
[3:38:59.840 --> 3:39:05.760]  and they practice storming the beaches. And again, all of this is acclimation, but that's not my opinion.
[3:39:08.960 --> 3:39:15.120]  In the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007. Read it for yourself. In the presidential
[3:39:15.120 --> 3:39:21.600]  decision directive 51 that Obama's continued. It states that the executive branch is supreme
[3:39:21.600 --> 3:39:26.960]  dictator over the entire government. Congress is even allowed to see the full copy of an international
[3:39:26.960 --> 3:39:39.440]  security in the Homeland Security Committee. In there, it states at all. And it states that
[3:39:39.440 --> 3:39:48.000]  that Homeland Security and Northcom will use US military to engage domestic threats and to police
[3:39:48.000 --> 3:39:54.320]  the United States. And the RAND Corporation came out two weeks ago. In fact, that's out in my stack.
[3:39:54.320 --> 3:39:59.280]  Well, somebody go grab me that RAND Corporation report. It's 200 pages roughly. It's out there
[3:39:59.280 --> 3:40:06.960]  in the stack on the table. I'll just show that to you. And it says how the Pentagon is already
[3:40:06.960 --> 3:40:12.240]  setting up and running and they propose it go fully operational total federalization of all
[3:40:12.240 --> 3:40:18.400]  local police where the military supports them and they support the military and domestic centers
[3:40:18.400 --> 3:40:22.480]  set up with a new Pentagon run national police force.
[3:40:22.480 --> 3:40:33.840]  And again, this is all rolled out slowly. It's all rolled out incrementally.
[3:40:37.360 --> 3:40:39.520]  Now, this is a national review article.
[3:40:42.080 --> 3:40:47.120]  And when you read the threat watch, that has the real breakdown really a scholarly report
[3:40:47.120 --> 3:40:53.280]  where it says Steve Shippert has more at threat watch. Why does Interpol need immunity from
[3:40:53.280 --> 3:40:57.600]  American law written by Andy McCarthy?
[3:41:02.480 --> 3:41:08.240]  You just can't make up how bizarre this crowd is. One week ago, President Obama quietly signed
[3:41:08.240 --> 3:41:13.680]  an executive order that makes international police force immune for the restraints of American law.
[3:41:13.680 --> 3:41:18.000]  Interpol is the shorthand for the international criminal police organization.
[3:41:19.360 --> 3:41:24.880]  It was established in 23 but really got powerful for World War Two and operates in 188 countries.
[3:41:25.920 --> 3:41:27.040]  It's the real mafia.
[3:41:29.200 --> 3:41:37.760]  By executive order 12,425 issued in 1983, President Reagan recognized Interpol's
[3:41:37.760 --> 3:41:42.480]  international organization and gave it some of the privileges and immunities customarily
[3:41:42.480 --> 3:41:48.640]  and extended to foreign diplomats. Interpol, however, is also an active law enforcement agency
[3:41:48.640 --> 3:41:53.840]  so critical privileges and immunity set forth in Section 2C of the International
[3:41:53.840 --> 3:41:59.280]  Organization's Immunities Act were withheld. That's the section we read earlier.
[3:42:00.080 --> 3:42:04.800]  Specifically, Interpol's property and assets remain subject to surge and seizure.
[3:42:04.800 --> 3:42:10.800]  They don't have diplomatic immunity and its archive records remain subject to public scrutiny
[3:42:10.800 --> 3:42:16.640]  under provisions like the Freedom of Information Act being constrained by the Fourth Amendment,
[3:42:16.640 --> 3:42:23.280]  the FOIA, and other limitations of the Constitution and federal law that protect the
[3:42:23.280 --> 3:42:29.200]  liberty and privacy of Americans and what prevents law enforcement and its controlling
[3:42:29.200 --> 3:42:37.120]  government authority from becoming tyrannical. Well, you little globalist over at the CIA
[3:42:37.120 --> 3:42:41.760]  founded National Review should have thought about that before you helped sell America out, huh?
[3:42:43.520 --> 3:42:48.160]  On Wednesday, however, for no apparent reason, President Obama issued an executive order
[3:42:48.160 --> 3:42:53.600]  removing the Reagan limitations. This is Interpol's property and assets are no longer subject
[3:42:53.600 --> 3:42:57.440]  to surge and confiscation and its archives are now considered
[3:42:58.800 --> 3:43:04.240]  inviolable. Inviable. I'm in trouble pronouncing that word, but that means
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:18.640]  basically the right of kings. Give me the definition of inviolable. I mean, I know it means
[3:43:18.640 --> 3:43:23.600]  that their sovereign standing apart cannot be violated, cannot have leans placed on it,
[3:43:23.600 --> 3:43:30.560]  cannot be abridged, but I want to check that. So, I-N-V-I-O-L-A-B-L-E and that's what the
[3:43:30.560 --> 3:43:35.120]  executive order says. The International Police Force, whose U.S. headquarters is the Justice
[3:43:35.120 --> 3:43:40.080]  Department of Washington, will be unrestrained by U.S. Constitution and American law while it
[3:43:40.080 --> 3:43:44.240]  operates the United States and affects both Americans and American interests outside the
[3:43:44.240 --> 3:43:50.240]  United States. And that's the key. This is not just about foreign troops, foreign police getting
[3:43:50.240 --> 3:43:58.000]  to come over here. This is about our FBI, our federal police, our federal marshals,
[3:43:58.000 --> 3:44:04.160]  fully operating under U.N. authority, international authority, and having immunity that's been
[3:44:04.160 --> 3:44:15.200]  extended to this guild. This inviolable. Interpol works closely with international
[3:44:15.200 --> 3:44:18.880]  tribunals such as the International Criminal Court, which the United States has refused to join
[3:44:18.880 --> 3:44:23.280]  because of its sovereignty, surrendering provisions. And remember what the Supreme
[3:44:23.280 --> 3:44:28.160]  Court has said. Five of the nine members have said recently. They've said we will follow
[3:44:28.160 --> 3:44:37.520]  the orders of the U.N. Listen to this. Marines and multinational forces train in Florida.
[3:44:39.840 --> 3:44:43.760]  Go ahead and play a clip of that. Go ahead and play the intro clip of that.
[3:44:45.520 --> 3:44:50.400]  Put that video up on screen. I'm going back to the previous document I asked for. Before I
[3:44:50.400 --> 3:44:55.600]  asked for Supreme Court Justices, articles were there in the U.S. say today and other places
[3:44:55.600 --> 3:45:02.080]  telling you that the U.N. is the boss. Here it is playing. This is the first time. Well, first,
[3:45:02.720 --> 3:45:06.480]  it's a great opportunity to always observe the Navy Marine Corps team do something
[3:45:06.480 --> 3:45:10.560]  together that no one else can do, but it's really important this year because the first
[3:45:10.560 --> 3:45:14.560]  time in 50 years, the U.S. Navy Marine Corps team is being joined by
[3:45:14.560 --> 3:45:21.920]  Dean Matteria from many countries throughout the Latin America region. So it's a really
[3:45:21.920 --> 3:45:26.000]  historic event for us. I think, personally, I think it's been a long time coming. It's important
[3:45:26.000 --> 3:45:31.600]  because it demonstrates the importance of the relationships between our countries and how
[3:45:31.600 --> 3:45:35.920]  important it is for us to continue to work together. A previous demonstration, basically,
[3:45:35.920 --> 3:45:41.760]  we had Marine Corps, U.S. Marine Corps. We have partner nation Marine Corps coming off the U.S.
[3:45:41.760 --> 3:45:47.360]  as Ashton and U.S. military to do what we call an eponymous demonstration. As you know. Okay. And
[3:45:47.360 --> 3:45:52.160]  then it cuts to tourists on the Florida beach with troops walking around with machine guns. Now,
[3:45:53.120 --> 3:45:59.760]  again, let me pull this up for people who are in denial. People really hate this one. Those in
[3:45:59.760 --> 3:46:04.400]  denial really don't know what to do about this one. I document everything live on the fly here,
[3:46:04.400 --> 3:46:08.400]  and the guys get a lot of credit for being able to pull this up so quick. Supreme Court Justice
[3:46:08.400 --> 3:46:16.480]  says U.N. law, Trump's U.S. law. That should pull it up for you. You'll get five of the nine saying
[3:46:16.480 --> 3:46:22.080]  it. They're all meant to come out and say it. So why does the U.N. have all this immunity set up
[3:46:22.080 --> 3:46:27.920]  by the Rockefellers in 1945 in Presidio, San Francisco, and Manhattan, New York, New York?
[3:46:29.600 --> 3:46:36.080]  Why? Why does, why do we constantly have U.N. bureaucrats every week I see it in the news all
[3:46:36.080 --> 3:46:40.720]  over the world, caught running white slavery, caught running drugs. No one can look in their
[3:46:40.720 --> 3:46:47.120]  suitcases. I mean, if a U.N. bureaucrat lands with 20 cases, no one can search it. This is the
[3:46:47.120 --> 3:46:52.720]  international crime syndicate of the globalist giving themselves the authorization to engage in
[3:46:52.720 --> 3:47:00.160]  white slavery, money laundering, drug shipments. The U.N. gets caught under diplomatic immunity
[3:47:00.160 --> 3:47:06.320]  with their private contractors like Dinecore and Halliburton on record loading up jets full of
[3:47:06.320 --> 3:47:11.040]  little kids and women they've kidnapped. The giant sex trade. This is on record.
[3:47:13.200 --> 3:47:18.400]  Could you end Trump U.S. Constitution? I don't know. That's the right article.
[3:47:20.320 --> 3:47:23.120]  Try USA Today behind it. Because I remember that headline.
[3:47:23.120 --> 3:47:31.440]  All right, continuing here. Interpol works closely with international tribunals,
[3:47:31.440 --> 3:47:34.560]  such as the International Criminal Court, which the United States has refused to join because
[3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:39.680]  of sovereignty surrendering provisions. The top Obama officials want to use it. It also works
[3:47:39.680 --> 3:47:44.960]  closely with foreign courts and law enforcement authorities, such as those in Europe that are
[3:47:44.960 --> 3:47:49.520]  investigating former Bush administration officials for war crimes. So they're, they're coming at this
[3:47:49.520 --> 3:47:54.080]  of, oh, we don't want that because they could, and then that sells the left on being for it.
[3:47:54.080 --> 3:47:59.680]  Don't worry. Obama's already said he's not going to investigate Bush and, you know, if one U.N.
[3:47:59.680 --> 3:48:04.800]  member votes for it, that means nothing. Don't worry. The crimes will go unpunished. But you
[3:48:04.800 --> 3:48:10.480]  can't have a kangaroo court try Bush for crimes. It's got to be a U.S. court. Why would we elevate
[3:48:10.480 --> 3:48:15.200]  international police force above American law? Why would we give immunity to an international
[3:48:15.200 --> 3:48:20.560]  police force from the limitations that constrain the FBI and other American law enforcement agencies?
[3:48:21.760 --> 3:48:27.520]  Why is it suddenly necessary to have within the Justice Department a repository for stashing
[3:48:27.520 --> 3:48:32.320]  government files, which therefore will be beyond the ability of Congress, American law enforcement
[3:48:32.320 --> 3:48:38.960]  and the media and the American people to scrutinize? Now, that's a good article. Now,
[3:48:39.920 --> 3:48:44.400]  here's another one out of the Jerusalem post. We're running out of time here, but Jerusalem
[3:48:44.400 --> 3:48:52.000]  post, December 21st, IDF, U.S. National Guard to share defense ideas. And you read the article
[3:48:54.160 --> 3:49:02.880]  and it openly says in the article that, oh, the IDF has liaison officers in all the major
[3:49:02.880 --> 3:49:07.120]  branches of the military, but now they're going to have one in the Federal Emergency Management
[3:49:07.120 --> 3:49:12.560]  Agency and they're going to have one in the Homeland Security and they're going to deploy
[3:49:12.560 --> 3:49:19.840]  to any operations inside the United States. He will go to training exercises, conferences,
[3:49:19.840 --> 3:49:25.200]  and if needed, will deploy with the National Guard to emergency situations, the officer explained.
[3:49:25.200 --> 3:49:31.200]  But can I have a document cam shot? People will deny this is in here. I've found more hit pieces
[3:49:31.200 --> 3:49:36.400]  today on us where they just say, Interpol's not taking over and that none of this is true,
[3:49:36.400 --> 3:49:40.000]  and then I'm making it all up, thinking you're stupid and won't look into this.
[3:49:40.000 --> 3:49:45.760]  And of course, it always comes from, quote, sources we can trust. Yeah.
[3:49:48.400 --> 3:49:52.080]  People from our supposed-owned camp trying to make you live in denial out there about what's
[3:49:52.080 --> 3:50:00.160]  happening. Israel's own Home Front Command National Guard will be bolstered during the
[3:50:00.160 --> 3:50:06.880]  operations. See, they call it Home Front Command. Here it's Homeland Security and it goes on. So
[3:50:06.880 --> 3:50:11.600]  there you go. And here it is. Now, again, every time I mention this, I get emails going, well,
[3:50:11.600 --> 3:50:15.920]  Mike, yeah, the Explorer scouts do work with police. What's wrong with that?
[3:50:17.120 --> 3:50:22.880]  Well, I happen to have the New York Times and countless other newspaper articles where Secure
[3:50:22.880 --> 3:50:28.560]  Corps, Division of AmeriCorps, and other groups are doing paramilitary training for the last 10 years
[3:50:29.520 --> 3:50:32.880]  with the federal government to, quote, take on disgruntled veterans.
[3:50:32.880 --> 3:50:40.240]  And here is the daily news. It's also in the Contra Coast Times. LAPD on course to take over
[3:50:40.240 --> 3:50:47.120]  Explorer program completely from the Boy Scouts. 3,000 young people have already gone through
[3:50:47.120 --> 3:50:54.080]  the LAPD program training them to be law enforcement. And then you go find out what this
[3:50:54.080 --> 3:51:03.920]  training entails. And it's taken on American gun owners. That's in this New York Times article.
[3:51:03.920 --> 3:51:08.960]  Remain in your houses. The President of the United States has declared martial law under
[3:51:08.960 --> 3:51:16.640]  executive order 11,004. Will they do it? Will they pull the trigger this time? We all pray they
[3:51:16.640 --> 3:51:22.800]  stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day. Think it can't
[3:51:22.800 --> 3:51:30.960]  happen here. Executive order 10,990 locks down all highways. Executive order 10,995
[3:51:30.960 --> 3:51:37.760]  ceases control of all media outlets. Executive order 10,998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[3:51:38.320 --> 3:51:43.280]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[3:51:44.080 --> 3:51:48.400]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have questions
[3:51:48.400 --> 3:51:55.360]  about how to survive it, go to martiallawsurvival.com. That's martiallawsurvival.com. Go to

[3:52:03.440 --> 3:52:09.200]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last chance to
[3:52:09.200 --> 3:52:14.640]  not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[3:52:14.640 --> 3:52:20.400]  Americans at home. They have turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they
[3:52:20.400 --> 3:52:27.120]  really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[3:52:27.120 --> 3:52:32.560]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation. The criminal offshore cartel
[3:52:32.560 --> 3:52:37.200]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[3:52:37.200 --> 3:52:42.320]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying,
[3:52:42.320 --> 3:52:46.960]  who do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington,
[3:52:46.960 --> 3:52:54.000]  D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Full of the Republic on DVD

[3:53:59.040 --> 3:54:09.360]  Be a part of the revolution today. Yeah, we got the definition for inviolable.
[3:54:10.160 --> 3:54:15.280]  And it was exactly what I thought it was. Middle English from the middle French or Latin,
[3:54:16.880 --> 3:54:21.600]  15th century. It means secure from violation or
[3:54:21.600 --> 3:54:29.360]  profanation. That means the tax man sucking off you. Secure from assault or trespass.
[3:54:30.240 --> 3:54:35.680]  See, you don't own your property if you pay property taxes. You are an indentured surf.
[3:54:37.040 --> 3:54:41.200]  This country is no longer free a long time ago. Property rights is the base.
[3:54:43.440 --> 3:54:50.000]  We now are chattel property of the bankers through fraud. Any moment we can wake up and say no,
[3:54:50.000 --> 3:54:54.640]  but they're using the pretext of terrorism to set up the police state and control our lives.
[3:54:55.600 --> 3:55:01.280]  But I want you to understand this. They are training your children to spy on you in the
[3:55:01.280 --> 3:55:05.920]  public schools publicly. They are training your kids to come home and boss you around and write
[3:55:05.920 --> 3:55:11.760]  up reports on your environmental activities. They are training, and again it's in the New York
[3:55:11.760 --> 3:55:17.280]  Times saying how great it is, scouts trained to fight terrorists and more, disgruntled vets.
[3:55:17.280 --> 3:55:22.480]  And that's photos of the kids going in and doing drills of killing gun owners that won't turn
[3:55:22.480 --> 3:55:28.320]  their guns in. You cannot make this up. And now they're just completely taking it away from the
[3:55:28.320 --> 3:55:34.640]  Boy Scouts and making it local big city police programs, which are then federally controlled.
[3:55:36.720 --> 3:55:41.440]  In fact, here it is, LAPD on course to take over, explore program. This is going on nationwide.
[3:55:41.440 --> 3:55:47.840]  Again, eight, nine years ago, I saw Secure Corps under the Philadelphia police control under a
[3:55:47.840 --> 3:55:54.880]  federal grant. It's over. The country's gone. There's no chance in saving any of it unless
[3:55:54.880 --> 3:56:02.480]  we get honest about it. Now, as U.S. citizens, as sovereigns, as constitutionalists, as citizens of
[3:56:02.480 --> 3:56:10.720]  our states that constitute the federal government and its three just powers, we are sovereign.
[3:56:10.720 --> 3:56:16.560]  We are above the government unless we violate someone's rights, their property,
[3:56:17.600 --> 3:56:25.440]  or hurt someone unlawfully. Then a jury of our peers of other sovereigns convene the grand jury
[3:56:26.400 --> 3:56:33.040]  to decide whether you should be indicted. They then give that order to the judge, to the sheriff,
[3:56:33.040 --> 3:56:42.400]  to the bailiff, to the constables, to seize you. And then you're given due process. That's being
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:50.880]  erased. So citizens don't even really get that anymore. Instead, the U.N. is only 60-something
[3:56:50.880 --> 3:56:57.600]  years old, what, 1945? It sets itself up, private banking front, and says, we're above the law.
[3:56:57.600 --> 3:57:02.880]  No one can arrest us. No one can stop us. That's why Maurice Strong can commit all these big crimes.
[3:57:02.880 --> 3:57:07.440]  Steal hundreds of millions? Do nothing? Diplomatic immunity.
[3:57:10.480 --> 3:57:17.760]  So they go far above the immunity we had from tyranny under the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[3:57:20.880 --> 3:57:25.200]  Your private property never had to pay taxes on it, couldn't be taken by the government.
[3:57:25.840 --> 3:57:32.800]  Not even the king under English common law could take your home. Now, you don't pay the taxes,
[3:57:32.800 --> 3:57:37.360]  even though there's no way to pay them, they take your property. You have no sovereignty.
[3:57:37.360 --> 3:57:45.680]  They have godlike, Caesar, Caligula sovereignty. Whenever a king, whether it was in Babylon or
[3:57:45.680 --> 3:57:53.360]  Egypt or Greece or Rome or England, declared they were God and were above everyone,
[3:57:54.000 --> 3:57:57.840]  they would be overthrown as a tyrannous, as a tyrant.
[3:57:57.840 --> 3:58:06.320]  Now, the UN and anyone they designate, and see your government then designates,
[3:58:07.200 --> 3:58:11.600]  our government says, oh, you have immunity, but our own government's a member of it,
[3:58:11.600 --> 3:58:16.720]  so they get immunity. The government is above the law, foreign troops being brought in,
[3:58:16.720 --> 3:58:24.400]  brainwashing our kids, turning them against us. But then we have no sovereignty and no protections,
[3:58:24.400 --> 3:58:32.560]  the Patriot Act erases it all. This is a criminal rogue government. It's all exposed in my film,
[3:58:32.560 --> 3:58:38.480]  Fall of the Republic. Great job, crew. I break down what really happened with this
[3:58:40.480 --> 3:58:49.440]  panties bomber coming up. You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:49.440 --> 3:58:56.240]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[3:58:56.240 --> 3:59:00.560]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:59:00.560 --> 3:59:05.600]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[3:59:05.600 --> 3:59:11.200]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[3:59:11.200 --> 3:59:16.320]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:59:16.320 --> 3:59:21.040]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[3:59:21.040 --> 3:59:25.600]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[3:59:25.600 --> 3:59:30.400]  their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful
[3:59:30.400 --> 3:59:34.880]  backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[3:59:34.880 --> 3:59:41.600]  Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
