[00:00:05.362 --> 00:00:10.189]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:11.771]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.771 --> 00:00:12.712]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:17.539]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.584]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.556 --> 00:00:33.518]  Well, we're getting ready to close out 2009.
[00:00:33.518 --> 00:00:33.918]  It is Monday.
[00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.471]  The 28th day of December 2009.
[00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:45.334]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:45.334 --> 00:00:56.962]  Paul Watson will be joining us coming up briefly in the next segment to give us the latest information on the deadly underwear bomber that will end what's left of freedom in the world.
[00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:58.783]  Everyone must be a prisoner.
[00:00:58.783 --> 00:01:00.904]  You must have no electronics on the planes.
[00:01:00.904 --> 00:01:02.045]  You must stay in your seat.
[00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.552]  Planes are diverted and landing everywhere.
[00:01:05.552 --> 00:01:13.517]  If someone stays in the bathroom more than 10 minutes, you're not supposed to have your hands in your lap or put a blanket on your stomach.
[00:01:13.517 --> 00:01:17.939]  I mean, even a prisoner in a Supermax can have a blanket over their tummy.
[00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.480]  Supermax America.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.602]  Supermax World.
[00:01:21.602 --> 00:01:26.905]  All because some sharp-dressed man passed security in the airport
[00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:32.478]  And ordered the security to stand down to put this young man on the aircraft.
[00:01:32.478 --> 00:01:34.300]  He gets on the aircraft.
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.203]  Someone openly videotapes him throughout the flight.
[00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:40.844]  Openly.
[00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:46.208]  Stewardesses always come over and tell you to turn your cameras off for security reasons unless you're authorized.
[00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:49.270]  A guy in a suit videotapes from start to finish.
[00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.272]  Everyone's wondering why.
[00:01:51.272 --> 00:01:55.555]  Well, that's so the young man taking part in the drill would think it was all just a drill.
[00:01:55.555 --> 00:01:56.896]  Why, there's the guy with the camera.
[00:01:57.841 --> 00:02:00.082]  There's his handler with him.
[00:02:00.082 --> 00:02:02.784]  He's ushered through security.
[00:02:02.784 --> 00:02:04.885]  The young Nigerian.
[00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:08.027]  I mean, he's a wealthy, wealthy young man.
[00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:10.708]  His dad's one of the richest people in Nigeria.
[00:02:10.708 --> 00:02:13.690]  He's fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:14.911]  What other story is there?
[00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:19.474]  We know from past cases, this is exactly what's done.
[00:02:19.474 --> 00:02:24.034]  We know with the 7-7 bombings, these guys were hired to take part in drills.
[00:02:24.034 --> 00:02:31.716]  Some of them escaped, so they were machine-gunned by Canary Wharf.
[00:02:31.716 --> 00:02:33.816]  They were killed, hunted down.
[00:02:33.816 --> 00:02:39.938]  That was on the British News that morning on 7-7.
[00:02:39.938 --> 00:02:41.998]  The filmmaker made a documentary about it.
[00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:44.660]  7-7 ripple effect.
[00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.360]  They arrested him.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.422]  They were so freaked out by the film.
[00:02:50.422 --> 00:02:55.284]  And they do the same thing over and over and over.
[00:02:55.284 --> 00:02:57.165]  And how do you know it's staged?
[00:02:57.165 --> 00:03:10.891]  Not just all the evidence that it's staged that we're going to go over today, but the way it's hyped instantly and the president stopping short his trip and then in Hawaii getting minute-by-minute reports and being told about
[00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:17.010]  What if someone drops an old shoe somewhere in Albuquerque, New Mexico?
[00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.211]  And was somebody in the potty more than 10 minutes on another flight?
[00:03:21.211 --> 00:03:31.154]  And hyperventilating and everyone in fear, hoping more FEMA camps are built, hoping they'll surveil us, hoping they launch new wars.
[00:03:31.154 --> 00:03:33.435]  There's 25 Al-Qaeda sleepers.
[00:03:33.435 --> 00:03:34.735]  They're white Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:36.636]  They're working with American gun owners.
[00:03:36.636 --> 00:03:38.216]  We've got to take the guns!
[00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:40.137]  Homeland Security, save us!
[00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:41.017]  It's all over!
[00:03:41.297 --> 00:03:42.798]  What do we gotta do?
[00:03:42.798 --> 00:03:50.404]  There's, there's, there's somebody who detonated something that sounded like a firecracker and then it was a small fire.
[00:03:50.404 --> 00:03:54.648]  And then it's a minor footnote in the U.S.
[00:03:54.648 --> 00:03:55.328]  News.
[00:03:55.328 --> 00:03:59.291]  Well, yes, someone, some smart-dressed person did direct him past security.
[00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:01.573]  Well, who's security gonna stand down for?
[00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:02.874]  Security?
[00:04:02.874 --> 00:04:04.035]  Interpol?
[00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:05.236]  Mossad?
[00:04:05.236 --> 00:04:06.337]  FBI?
[00:04:06.337 --> 00:04:06.878]  We don't know.
[00:04:08.055 --> 00:04:10.937]  And then, at the gate, they start saying, well, where's the passport?
[00:04:10.937 --> 00:04:16.240]  Because on international flights, they check them doubly, in many cases.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.521]  Especially in Northern Europe.
[00:04:19.521 --> 00:04:22.983]  And he said, look, you let him on.
[00:04:22.983 --> 00:04:27.306]  Flash some type of badge, and he went on.
[00:04:27.306 --> 00:04:34.550]  Then, someone else in a suit is waiting on board the aircraft, videotaping the entire flight in front of everyone.
[00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:42.515]  Again, that's to make the young'un go through with the drill.
[00:04:42.515 --> 00:04:48.501]  Remember all of the reports of Mohammed Adda and others doing drills before 9-11?
[00:04:48.501 --> 00:04:50.784]  Of course, we know they were trained at U.S.
[00:04:50.784 --> 00:04:53.166]  military bases.
[00:04:53.166 --> 00:04:59.353]  We're going to go over some of this today, and then we're going to get into the economy, healthcare, and more.
[00:05:00.626 --> 00:05:04.730]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.613]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:07.613 --> 00:05:09.695]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:05:09.695 --> 00:05:11.937]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:05:11.937 --> 00:05:13.599]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.903]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:05:18.063 --> 00:05:20.625]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[00:05:20.625 --> 00:05:26.651]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecolablue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:31.435]  Their best seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:34.257]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:05:34.257 --> 00:05:37.000]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.146]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[00:05:44.446 --> 00:05:48.168]  Order now and claim your water independence today by calling a Coloblue at 1-800-691-6043.

[00:05:48.428 --> 00:05:50.349]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:06:00.407 --> 00:06:04.949]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:05.869]  Number one.
[00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:09.291]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:10.151]  Number two.
[00:06:10.151 --> 00:06:15.033]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:15.773]  It's true.
[00:06:15.773 --> 00:06:20.335]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.655 --> 00:06:21.476]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.476 --> 00:06:25.059]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:25.059 --> 00:06:28.982]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.982 --> 00:06:29.783]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.783 --> 00:06:32.545]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.545 --> 00:06:36.228]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:36.228 --> 00:06:36.449]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.989 --> 00:06:41.133]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:41.133 --> 00:06:46.197]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:50.381]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:50.381 --> 00:06:52.162]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:56.766]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[00:07:02.093 --> 00:07:06.054]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:06.054 --> 00:07:14.916]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:14.916 --> 00:07:19.557]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:19.557 --> 00:07:30.379]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:40.521]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:40.521 --> 00:07:45.943]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[00:07:45.943 --> 00:07:53.424]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:53.424 --> 00:07:56.185]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:06.513]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.513 --> 00:08:08.875]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.875 --> 00:08:30.411]  There is absolutely no doubt that the United States, Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada are being turned into heavily armed, high-tech surveilled,
[00:08:32.432 --> 00:08:34.314]  Robbery centers.
[00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:43.602]  Everything is being designed for the looting, for the robbing, for the societal, cultural, economic raping of the people.
[00:08:43.602 --> 00:08:49.567]  There is absolutely no doubt the entire system is completely bankrupt.
[00:08:49.567 --> 00:08:50.829]  A fraud.
[00:08:50.829 --> 00:08:57.755]  The big banks want to bankrupt society financially so they can bring the entire planet into receivership.
[00:08:59.329 --> 00:09:19.316]  The states are all in the process of going bankrupt, and as you see that happening, you see the state budgets going up, the federal budgets going up, the spending just being accelerated, every form of liberty and freedom being abridged and abolished and desecrated, defiled.
[00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:35.337]  Our biggest problem, all of us, is that we don't consciously, every day, let it really burn into our psyches and into our intellects.
[00:09:35.337 --> 00:09:39.940]  Both intellectually, at a cold-blooded level, and at an emotional level.
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:43.622]  We don't let it really soak in just how much trouble we're in.
[00:09:46.912 --> 00:09:56.277]  Now, in the coming days, I'm going to have year-in-review, I'm going to have decade-in-review, looking forward into the next decade.
[00:09:56.277 --> 00:10:04.241]  We're going to obviously go over government takeover of healthcare and what's really in it.
[00:10:04.241 --> 00:10:15.767]  And what an amazing statement it is by Chris Matthews that his hero is Saul Alensky, who was an open, hardcore communist, who openly called for re-education camps in America.
[00:10:18.348 --> 00:10:26.470]  Years ago, I bought Rules for Radicals, one of the first editions that had the pledge to Lucifer in the introduction.
[00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:28.291]  It's dedicated and pledged to Lucifer.
[00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:31.112]  I was digging around for it last night.
[00:10:31.112 --> 00:10:37.913]  Since we moved offices, it's hard to find anything, but hundreds and hundreds of books here, but it doesn't matter.
[00:10:37.913 --> 00:10:40.234]  It's on record that he pledged the book to Lucifer.
[00:10:40.234 --> 00:10:42.195]  Who can make that up?
[00:10:42.195 --> 00:10:46.756]  That Hillary wrote her thesis, her PhD thesis, to Saul Alinsky?
[00:10:48.058 --> 00:10:50.758]  And it's sealed under national security.
[00:10:50.758 --> 00:10:55.539]  Obama wrote one of his major papers on Saul Alensky.
[00:10:55.539 --> 00:10:59.060]  I mean, we really do have communists running America.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.580]  It's really happening.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:06.321]  And they really do work for big banks, just like they did in the Soviet Union.
[00:11:06.321 --> 00:11:13.722]  And in communist China, David Rockefeller writes in his memoirs how they funded the communist Chinese, they funded the UN.
[00:11:13.722 --> 00:11:15.983]  These people are such criminals!
[00:11:15.983 --> 00:11:16.963]  And they think it's all funny!
[00:11:18.137 --> 00:11:20.639]  They praise Mao Zedong!
[00:11:20.639 --> 00:11:26.163]  In New York Time editorials, one that Rockefeller wrote that I've got in the film, Endgame.
[00:11:26.163 --> 00:11:28.125]  I don't just have an article about him saying that.
[00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:33.729]  We went to the microfilm at the University of Texas, the microfish, and pulled it up.
[00:11:33.729 --> 00:11:36.631]  How great what Stalin did was.
[00:11:36.631 --> 00:11:38.433]  How great what Lenin did.
[00:11:38.433 --> 00:11:41.375]  How great Mao is.
[00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:43.897]  These guys all constantly write about it.
[00:11:43.897 --> 00:11:46.239]  And of course, they're all trillionaires.
[00:11:46.239 --> 00:11:47.180]  They control trillions.
[00:11:48.422 --> 00:11:56.405]  They're all tax-free, government is their tool, and their vanguard, their enforcers, are the communists.
[00:11:56.405 --> 00:11:57.726]  They're not communists.
[00:11:57.726 --> 00:11:58.966]  That doesn't exist.
[00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:01.127]  They're robbers.
[00:12:01.127 --> 00:12:04.489]  And what they do is throw out a little bit of chicken feed.
[00:12:04.489 --> 00:12:09.691]  On average, $1 for every 30 the banks steal.
[00:12:09.691 --> 00:12:16.314]  It's like a pirate captain who keeps $30, 30 gold pieces for themselves,
[00:12:17.287 --> 00:12:21.811]  And then gives the entire crew of pirates one gold piece.
[00:12:21.811 --> 00:12:25.034]  And they love it.
[00:12:25.034 --> 00:12:26.956]  And so they've got the country domesticated.
[00:12:26.956 --> 00:12:30.179]  Half the country is now sucking off the other half.
[00:12:30.179 --> 00:12:37.766]  And now they're getting ready to close in ranks and to totally destroy anybody with any wealth who isn't an elitist.
[00:12:40.782 --> 00:12:45.864]  And I've got all the mainstream news articles where in Detroit and L.A.
[00:12:45.864 --> 00:12:56.607]  and Dallas and every other major city I look up, they're openly taking the Boy Scouts away from the Boy Scouts and openly giving it to the police department.
[00:12:56.607 --> 00:13:02.549]  In L.A., they've already trained 3,000 inner-city kids, just like in Russia.
[00:13:02.549 --> 00:13:07.191]  They hire the poor kids, they take the CPS kids, they're in the program, the foster kids.
[00:13:09.463 --> 00:13:12.204]  And they literally turn them into enforcers.
[00:13:12.204 --> 00:13:14.444]  Russia did this 30, 40 years ago.
[00:13:14.444 --> 00:13:15.585]  It's now happening here.
[00:13:15.585 --> 00:13:18.185]  Hitler did it.
[00:13:18.185 --> 00:13:24.667]  And they openly are on the news training the kids to quote, take on American gun owners.
[00:13:24.667 --> 00:13:27.848]  I mean, it doesn't get more hardcore police state than that.
[00:13:27.848 --> 00:13:29.028]  That's coming up.
[00:13:29.028 --> 00:13:30.648]  You know, I talked some about it yesterday.
[00:13:30.648 --> 00:13:31.889]  I want to talk more today.
[00:13:31.889 --> 00:13:36.910]  Interpol executive order given unlimited
[00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:47.554]  Power inside the United States.
[00:13:47.554 --> 00:13:52.817]  Even National Review, the little CIA front organizations decrying it.
[00:13:52.817 --> 00:13:57.279]  Started by William F. Buckley.
[00:13:57.279 --> 00:13:59.401]  In fact guys, I thought I printed it but I didn't.
[00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:00.781]  Will you Google for me?
[00:14:00.781 --> 00:14:01.182]  I need it.
[00:14:03.536 --> 00:14:06.997]  Obama gives diplomatic immunity to Interpol National Review.
[00:14:06.997 --> 00:14:08.317]  I want that version.
[00:14:08.317 --> 00:14:11.218]  And then go to the other article Nimmo posted about it.
[00:14:11.218 --> 00:14:13.519]  He had like five, six links to mainstream news.
[00:14:13.519 --> 00:14:19.021]  When I cover that, I want to source mainstream, because people have a conditioning mechanism in them, especially new listeners.
[00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:20.021]  They're just out of hand.
[00:14:20.021 --> 00:14:24.642]  Anything scary, they just deny it exists.
[00:14:24.642 --> 00:14:30.684]  People are scared of the dark and fairy tales and things that aren't real, but they're not scared of real things.
[00:14:32.065 --> 00:14:44.691]  I can't tell you how many adult men, when I've been out deer hunting or something, I say, hey, let's go for a walk at night to the woods, and full grown men, 90% of them, I've done this many times, are scared and want to turn back.
[00:14:44.691 --> 00:14:49.774]  Men are scared of the dark when there's nothing out there.
[00:14:49.774 --> 00:14:52.155]  We're the ultimate predator when you're walking around in the woods.
[00:14:54.639 --> 00:15:04.169]  But they're not scared of a big giant global government that openly writes giant textbooks about how they're poisoning your water supply and plan to kill you and your family.
[00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:08.414]  Don't be scared of something actually that's completely tyrannical.
[00:15:08.414 --> 00:15:10.096]  The Tyrannosaurus Rex of tyranny.
[00:15:15.856 --> 00:15:17.297]  I just don't even know what to say anymore.
[00:15:17.297 --> 00:15:18.878]  It's so mind-blowing.
[00:15:18.878 --> 00:15:30.666]  And all of these establishment types on the left and right who think they're part of the power structure in the system, and who are going to, quote, play it safe and not get involved and not speak up or stand up to tyranny.
[00:15:30.666 --> 00:15:33.227]  Do you have any idea what's happening to us right now?
[00:15:33.227 --> 00:15:36.870]  Do you have any idea we're in the process of being completely robbed?
[00:15:42.133 --> 00:15:45.596]  And I read about Interpol.
[00:15:45.596 --> 00:15:49.800]  Do you know Interpol and the United Nations have been caught all over the world?
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:57.327]  I hear a story on this from Watson or somebody.
[00:15:57.327 --> 00:16:02.913]  Do you understand that they use that diplomatic immunity to run white slavery rings worldwide?
[00:16:02.913 --> 00:16:07.357]  That is a documented fact in literally hundreds of mainstream news stories.
[00:16:11.874 --> 00:16:14.575]  They run the drugs, everything.
[00:16:14.575 --> 00:16:18.698]  And now they're going to operate in the United States with total diplomatic immunity.
[00:16:18.698 --> 00:16:21.419]  How many U.N.
[00:16:21.419 --> 00:16:30.984]  officials... How many times have you heard about U.N.
[00:16:30.984 --> 00:16:35.166]  diplomats and even their employees who all have diplomatic immunity in New York?
[00:16:35.166 --> 00:16:40.689]  Every few months you hear about them running slave rings or kidnap kids or drugs and they don't even get in trouble.
[00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:47.070]  And the UN everywhere running oil for food programs, keeping food back from people, they don't give them money.
[00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:53.352]  And they're caught running torture rings everywhere, and snuff rings, snuff film rings.
[00:16:53.352 --> 00:16:58.534]  And now, they're gonna operate in America and do whatever they want.
[00:16:58.534 --> 00:17:05.756]  And anybody who's part of Interpol, MI6, FBI, oh yeah, the FBI's gonna operate with immunity under international control.
[00:17:05.756 --> 00:17:10.417]  The Mossad, Shin Bet, the German intelligence, all of them!
[00:17:11.988 --> 00:17:16.810]  They're getting ready to turn their mercs and hounds loose in America.
[00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:19.531]  You know why they feed on people in Eastern and Central Europe?
[00:17:19.531 --> 00:17:29.735]  Because they had corrupt governments.
[00:17:29.735 --> 00:17:31.616]  You know why they feed on people in North Korea?
[00:17:31.616 --> 00:17:34.437]  Because the people have a broken back.
[00:17:34.437 --> 00:17:35.838]  They've capitulated to corruption.
[00:17:37.568 --> 00:17:39.288]  They've lost all hope.
[00:17:39.288 --> 00:17:41.769]  You know why they run giant child kidnapping rings in Mexico?
[00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:43.649]  Because it's a third world police state.
[00:17:43.649 --> 00:17:45.310]  Because the police run it.
[00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:48.291]  And now, they're gonna run it in America.
[00:17:48.291 --> 00:17:54.352]  And I'm telling you folks, you gotta stand up to it when the government tries to take your kids.
[00:17:54.352 --> 00:18:00.714]  They already do it with CPS and openly fence the kids into white slavery.
[00:18:00.714 --> 00:18:02.354]  And now they're just gonna have Interpol doing it.
[00:18:04.929 --> 00:18:07.071]  We are now going into total bondage.
[00:18:07.071 --> 00:18:09.453]  It's now happening.
[00:18:09.453 --> 00:18:26.107]  Openly training, openly federalizing the Boy Scouts and turning them purely into arms of major city police departments under federal grants, training to take on American patriots.
[00:18:27.253 --> 00:18:33.539]  You imagine if somebody 30 years ago made a science fiction movie in the year 2009.
[00:18:33.539 --> 00:18:36.501]  Foreign banks have bankrupt the country by design.
[00:18:36.501 --> 00:18:45.769]  The youth organizations have been turned into federalized spy forces and are being paramilitarily trained to take on remaining gun owners.
[00:18:45.769 --> 00:18:49.973]  International treaty is allowing the UN to take over national parks and parkland.
[00:18:51.104 --> 00:18:54.306]  Genetically modified food is poisoning the population.
[00:18:54.306 --> 00:18:57.628]  Live viruses are sprayed on almost all meat.
[00:18:57.628 --> 00:19:00.990]  Linked to major disorders of the intestine.
[00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:03.852]  Hundreds of deadly chemicals are put in the water supply.
[00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:07.894]  The mainstream media calls for open drugging of the water.
[00:19:07.894 --> 00:19:13.778]  Over a million children are grabbed without due process every year from their parents.
[00:19:13.778 --> 00:19:17.941]  The United States launches preemptive attacks on sovereign countries.
[00:19:17.941 --> 00:19:19.862]  Lies about weapons of mass destruction.
[00:19:21.596 --> 00:19:31.220]  Americans are not allowed to put their hands in their laps, or have blankets on their laps, or go to the bathroom on airline flights.
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:35.722]  The government proposes shock bracelets be worn by citizens.
[00:19:35.722 --> 00:19:39.824]  Face scanning cameras are put in nationwide.
[00:19:39.824 --> 00:19:41.145]  You wouldn't believe it.
[00:19:41.145 --> 00:19:43.025]  Now it's here.
[00:19:43.025 --> 00:19:45.787]  And they prepare to turn loose the foreign mercs.
[00:19:46.843 --> 00:19:49.888]  Because they think you're cowards, just like people in third world countries.
[00:19:49.888 --> 00:19:55.979]  They think you're going to lay down when they take your kids, fly them overseas, rape them to death, and then blow their heads off.
[00:19:55.979 --> 00:19:57.942]  We'll be right back with Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:19:57.942 --> 00:19:58.423]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.812 --> 00:20:03.993]  Is your computer running slowly?
[00:20:03.993 --> 00:20:05.755]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[00:20:05.755 --> 00:20:06.955]  Don't waste your money!

[00:21:01.178 --> 00:21:03.360]  Why are you letting that search engine spy on you?
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.200]  Spy on me?
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:04.521]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.521 --> 00:21:09.585]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.585 --> 00:21:11.206]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:11.206 --> 00:21:11.947]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.947 --> 00:21:12.367]  Yeah.
[00:21:12.367 --> 00:21:13.468]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:13.468 --> 00:21:16.430]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.
[00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:20.294]  They don't record your searches or your IP address, and the search results are great.
[00:21:20.294 --> 00:21:23.096]  Plus, Startpage is third-party certified, and it's totally free.
[00:21:23.416 --> 00:21:26.038]  I don't want Big Brother watching what I do on the internet.
[00:21:26.038 --> 00:21:27.639]  I'm adding StartPage to my browser.
[00:21:27.639 --> 00:21:27.939]  Right!

[00:21:31.242 --> 00:21:31.822]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:31.822 --> 00:21:33.183]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:33.183 --> 00:21:37.046]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:37.046 --> 00:21:40.829]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:22:02.987 --> 00:22:04.428]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:04.428 --> 00:22:10.493]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:10.493 --> 00:22:11.293]  That's right.
[00:22:11.293 --> 00:22:14.135]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:14.135 --> 00:22:21.081]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:21.621 --> 00:22:29.763]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:29.763 --> 00:22:35.244]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:35.244 --> 00:22:41.045]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:41.045 --> 00:22:45.566]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:22:45.566 --> 00:22:45.806]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.426 --> 00:22:50.910]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:51.190]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.390]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.579 --> 00:23:02.259]  Attention!
[00:23:02.259 --> 00:23:17.625]  An important product from hempusa.org, micro plant powder, will change your life by removing all types of positive toxins, such as heavy metals, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungus from the digestive tract and stomach wall so you can absorb nutrients.
[00:23:17.625 --> 00:23:19.246]  Micro plant powder is 89% silica and
[00:23:20.606 --> 00:23:21.246]  We're good to go!
[00:23:46.893 --> 00:23:47.013]  Okay!
[00:24:12.025 --> 00:24:38.113]  When you look at the Christmas Day underwear bomber, known as the syringe bomber, all of the evidence, the physical evidence, the eyewitness evidence, the man bringing him through the airport, getting him on the plane without a passport, his father going and warning the government, saying the State Department,
[00:24:39.212 --> 00:24:43.734]  The fact that he was kept off the terror watch list to come to the U.S.
[00:24:43.734 --> 00:24:44.794]  It's the same M.O.
[00:24:44.794 --> 00:24:47.975]  we've seen a million times.
[00:24:47.975 --> 00:24:58.259]  Now you have confirmed someone on the plane videotaping him with his camera on him from start to finish.
[00:24:58.259 --> 00:25:00.900]  Guaranteed he was told it was part of a drill.
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.681]  That's how they set these young idiots up.
[00:25:06.084 --> 00:25:11.588]  And now they'll drug him up, torture him, body double him whenever they have to, and have a big show trial out of it.
[00:25:11.588 --> 00:25:15.551]  Now they're saying 25 Al Qaeda's are gonna hit you.
[00:25:15.551 --> 00:25:19.213]  The government's gotta take all your rights, and your bank account, by the way, to keep you safe.
[00:25:19.213 --> 00:25:23.156]  Paul Watson's written some key articles at PrisonPlanet.com, so has Curt Nemo.
[00:25:23.156 --> 00:25:25.297]  Paul Watson, thank you for joining us.
[00:25:25.297 --> 00:25:26.758]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:25:26.758 --> 00:25:31.602]  Okay, run through the evidence, the details, the background in this segment, a little bit in the next.
[00:25:31.602 --> 00:25:31.902]  Go ahead.
[00:25:33.424 --> 00:25:54.794]  Well, yeah, this individual, um, Molotov, I think his name is, Motolov is the pronunciation, is a Nigerian that, um, bought a ticket for a round-trip flight which cost him $2,800 from Nigeria to Detroit via Amsterdam.
[00:25:54.794 --> 00:26:02.718]  And, uh, for that huge trip, he only had one small carry-on bag for his luggage, which was the first red flag.
[00:26:03.735 --> 00:26:07.177]  Then, of course, he's on the terror watch list.
[00:26:07.177 --> 00:26:09.118]  His father warns U.S.
[00:26:09.118 --> 00:26:13.260]  intelligence a month ago that he thinks he's a threat.
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:20.023]  He's accompanied by this, um, what eyewitnesses who were on the plane described as a sharp-dressed man.
[00:26:20.023 --> 00:26:24.565]  It later emerged that he was Indian-looking.
[00:26:24.565 --> 00:26:30.488]  He lied about the circumstances of the underwear bomber, said he was a
[00:26:31.129 --> 00:26:35.070]  Yemen refugee, even though he's Nigerian.
[00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:41.971]  And basically, he got him on the plane without a passport, via whatever means.
[00:26:41.971 --> 00:26:57.355]  Now, what's interesting about that is that after the incident, when he was arrested, eyewitnesses also described a second man being detained by the FBI, but the FBI says they only ever detained the terrorists.
[00:26:58.052 --> 00:27:04.657]  So what happened to that man, whether he was a handler, it seems pretty clear that he was involved deeply.
[00:27:04.657 --> 00:27:20.730]  And then, of course, you've got the reports which you just mentioned about the man calmly filming the entire flight from start to finish and filming the entire scenario where he attempted to detonate this device.
[00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:24.553]  Now, from every fact, to me, it seems that this was
[00:27:25.345 --> 00:27:27.407]  A contrived scare.
[00:27:27.407 --> 00:27:30.629]  It was never meant to blow up the plane.
[00:27:30.629 --> 00:27:37.814]  And now the reports are saying that even the bomber himself said that he never meant to blow up the plane.
[00:27:37.814 --> 00:27:44.219]  That the liquid and the explosive devices he had were not enough to blow up the plane.
[00:27:44.219 --> 00:27:52.305]  And of course, all he managed to do was to set fire to the wall of the plane and those fires were soon extinguished.
[00:27:52.305 --> 00:27:54.547]  And the result of all of this
[00:27:55.265 --> 00:28:15.764]  Is that now the government of the United States and Britain are saying, and in fact the British government this morning is saying that as a result of this incident, the use of full body scanners, which of course produce a naked image of passengers, will have to be implemented
[00:28:17.915 --> 00:28:32.059]  And notice this is right as it's being implemented in every major airport and as people are refusing the naked body scanners that record your children's bodies, your bodies, in a biometric database so they can scan you from a distance.
[00:28:32.059 --> 00:28:33.820]  That's the real reason.
[00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.081]  Oh, now if you refuse, oh, you're going to have to pay.
[00:28:37.081 --> 00:28:45.544]  So this is all about making us submit and the airports are the main beta testing centers for society to train us how to be good slaves.
[00:28:46.243 --> 00:28:54.373]  That's right, because after the Richard Reed shoe bombing attempt, that was when they ordered us all to take off our shoes when we walked through security.
[00:28:54.373 --> 00:28:58.639]  So now as a result of this, we're going to be ordered to go through this naked scanning machine.
[00:28:59.309 --> 00:29:07.732]  And the importance of it is that... And if a person ever was to pull something out of their rectum, we'll all have to have proctology exams at the airport.
[00:29:07.732 --> 00:29:09.652]  And we're not joking about this.
[00:29:09.652 --> 00:29:13.974]  Homeland Security is looking at making you wear taser bracelets.
[00:29:13.974 --> 00:29:14.934]  All of you.
[00:29:14.934 --> 00:29:16.835]  This is your dog training.
[00:29:16.835 --> 00:29:20.136]  This is you being brought to your knees.
[00:29:20.136 --> 00:29:21.876]  Go ahead.
[00:29:21.876 --> 00:29:26.518]  And what's important about it is that in any major city,
[00:29:27.222 --> 00:29:35.966]  Where you visit a public building or a museum or anything like that, you now have to go through airport-style scanning machines.
[00:29:35.966 --> 00:29:39.667]  This is being introduced on our streets and in our shopping malls.
[00:29:39.667 --> 00:29:43.248]  This is the government circling the wagons against the people.
[00:29:43.248 --> 00:29:51.512]  This whole airport system, as Ridge said seven years ago, is the plan to take over complete society.
[00:29:51.512 --> 00:29:52.912]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.912 --> 00:29:54.413]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.430 --> 00:30:02.056]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.056 --> 00:30:06.079]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:06.079 --> 00:30:09.322]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:09.322 --> 00:30:14.146]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:30:14.146 --> 00:30:20.532]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.532 --> 00:30:22.754]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:23.294 --> 00:30:23.594]  Tim Geithner?
[00:30:23.594 --> 00:30:24.095]  Bernanke?
[00:30:24.095 --> 00:30:24.715]  They're arsonists!
[00:30:24.715 --> 00:30:25.436]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.436 --> 00:30:27.557]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:42.188 --> 00:30:46.572]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[00:30:46.572 --> 00:30:49.475]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:30:49.475 --> 00:30:58.583]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:01.291 --> 00:31:04.313]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:04.313 --> 00:31:09.636]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:09.636 --> 00:31:11.677]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:11.677 --> 00:31:16.680]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.860]  How much do you want?
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:18.981]  When do you want it?
[00:31:18.981 --> 00:31:20.882]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:20.882 --> 00:31:21.943]  When will you need it?
[00:31:21.943 --> 00:31:24.144]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:24.144 --> 00:31:25.485]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:25.485 --> 00:31:27.025]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:27.025 --> 00:31:28.066]  If there's a quarantine,
[00:31:28.226 --> 00:31:29.547]  And you can't feed yourself?
[00:31:29.547 --> 00:31:32.270]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:32.270 --> 00:31:35.854]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:35.854 --> 00:31:39.678]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:39.678 --> 00:31:40.920]  How much will you need?
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.821]  We don't know.
[00:31:41.821 --> 00:31:42.922]  How much do you want?
[00:31:42.922 --> 00:31:43.843]  All you can get.
[00:31:43.843 --> 00:31:44.664]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:44.924 --> 00:31:47.986]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:47.986 --> 00:31:50.168]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:50.168 --> 00:31:51.189]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:32:00.296 --> 00:32:07.280]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.561]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[00:32:08.561 --> 00:32:09.381]  It's very real.
[00:32:09.381 --> 00:32:13.284]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[00:32:13.284 --> 00:32:17.746]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:32:17.746 --> 00:32:20.328]  Clean, great-tasting water without all the pollutants.

[00:32:47.841 --> 00:32:48.101]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:32:48.101 --> 00:32:50.022]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:33:16.775 --> 00:33:35.167]  By the way, we've got Gerald Salente and many other really informative guests and forecasters who understand trends coming on throughout the week to do a year in review and looking forward into the next year as well.
[00:33:35.167 --> 00:33:46.315]  Throughout this week, as we close out 2009 and go into 2010, Godfrey Bloom is a member of the European Parliament from Yorkshire.
[00:33:48.131 --> 00:33:53.653]  From the United Kingdom Independence Party.
[00:33:53.653 --> 00:33:58.074]  And he's given some very powerful speeches against the New World Order.
[00:33:58.074 --> 00:34:06.857]  He'll be joining us to talk about the globalist scourge, the globalist threat, and to get a British slash European view on how we stop this.
[00:34:06.857 --> 00:34:11.058]  So that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:34:11.058 --> 00:34:17.720]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's not only that a sharp-dressed man in a suit went past security flashing some type of credentials.
[00:34:19.801 --> 00:34:40.812]  Imagine this, at a European International Airport, somebody coming out of Nigeria, they go through the security checkpoint, flash their credentials, and gets him on the plane without a passport or ID, and lying and saying he was from Sudan.
[00:34:40.812 --> 00:34:46.355]  Then he gets on the plane, everybody's marveling, why is a guy sitting there a few aisles back videotaping this
[00:34:47.759 --> 00:34:54.642]  This young black man continually.
[00:34:54.642 --> 00:34:56.882]  Well, that's the handler.
[00:34:56.882 --> 00:34:58.163]  It's okay, Sonny.
[00:34:58.163 --> 00:34:59.103]  See, I'm here filming it.
[00:34:59.103 --> 00:35:00.144]  This is part of a drill.
[00:35:00.144 --> 00:35:01.704]  We're filming this for the drill.
[00:35:01.704 --> 00:35:02.664]  The airline knows.
[00:35:02.664 --> 00:35:05.605]  You have the security man bring you on board the plane.
[00:35:05.605 --> 00:35:07.226]  You can be part of this.
[00:35:07.226 --> 00:35:08.467]  And the same thing happened on 7-7.
[00:35:11.769 --> 00:35:13.429]  Those guys had been approached.
[00:35:13.429 --> 00:35:15.130]  They'd been part of drills.
[00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:16.150]  A few of them escaped.
[00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.191]  They got chased down and machine-gunned.
[00:35:18.191 --> 00:35:22.912]  That was in British TV and radio that day, but got shut down.
[00:35:22.912 --> 00:35:28.193]  Witnesses reported the police chasing them down, gunning them down.
[00:35:28.193 --> 00:35:36.895]  They then thought separately that the young Brazilian electrician was one of them, so they executed him.
[00:35:36.895 --> 00:35:41.076]  Witnesses said they walked up, shot him 12 times in the head.
[00:35:42.119 --> 00:35:44.821]  Execution style.
[00:35:44.821 --> 00:35:49.563]  Stood up and said, all right, job done.
[00:35:49.563 --> 00:35:54.106]  And the guy said, no, no, please, no!
[00:35:54.106 --> 00:35:57.367]  It's so sick how they run these operations.
[00:35:57.367 --> 00:35:59.709]  It's just like the Fort Hood shooter.
[00:35:59.709 --> 00:36:03.170]  Witnesses reported hearing gunfire continue after he was on the ground.
[00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:04.671]  They reported multiple shooters.
[00:36:04.671 --> 00:36:05.712]  Same thing with Columbine.
[00:36:07.401 --> 00:36:10.062]  The Russians have been caught running similar ops.
[00:36:10.062 --> 00:36:22.766]  You go into a school or a building, you shoot a bunch of people, you dress up one of the people you blast as the terrorist, you in police uniforms escape out the back door because you are the police.
[00:36:22.766 --> 00:36:29.308]  And if you don't understand that this is done by all major governments, you're living on another planet.
[00:36:29.308 --> 00:36:36.511]  It's been declassified that our government did it several hundred times under Operation Gladio and the NATO option in Europe.
[00:36:37.446 --> 00:36:41.787]  Every time they wanted to demonize some political group, they'd stage bombings and blame it on their political enemies.
[00:36:43.439 --> 00:36:47.542]  But you are the enemy, the general population of the left.
[00:36:47.542 --> 00:36:48.602]  This is all for you.
[00:36:48.602 --> 00:36:52.705]  Remember when we got the secret Homeland Security and MIAC documents?
[00:36:52.705 --> 00:37:03.132]  How all of Homeland Security and NORTHCOM is set up for gun owners, veterans, conservatives, libertarians, people that want to quote, bring the bankers to justice.
[00:37:03.132 --> 00:37:04.913]  That's the illegitimate government.
[00:37:04.913 --> 00:37:07.214]  How are the bankers going to have their heist?
[00:37:07.214 --> 00:37:09.356]  They set up an internal police force.
[00:37:09.356 --> 00:37:10.757]  They staged terror attacks.
[00:37:11.517 --> 00:37:15.160]  As a pretext to clamp down on the people they're robbing!
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.542]  Period!
[00:37:17.542 --> 00:37:30.874]  And I wished over, and over, and over, and over, and over again, on Friday, on Christmas, when I heard about this,
[00:37:32.884 --> 00:37:34.645]  I said, let it be a real lone nut.
[00:37:34.645 --> 00:37:37.467]  I know there's some real Muslim terrorists out there.
[00:37:37.467 --> 00:37:38.487]  Let it be.
[00:37:38.487 --> 00:37:41.429]  But as soon as I saw the hype, I said, oh no.
[00:37:41.429 --> 00:37:53.555]  And then it came out that he was let on the plane and protected, and there was a guy on the plane videotaping him, and his dad called up and warned, and his dad's a high-level banker, and he was on the terror list, but the US government had him taken off the terror list.
[00:37:53.555 --> 00:37:55.616]  I mean, they put congressmen on that thing.
[00:37:55.616 --> 00:37:56.397]  They put a million
[00:37:58.353 --> 00:37:59.413]  It's more like a million and a half.
[00:37:59.413 --> 00:38:03.254]  In the last year, they don't give you the numbers anymore, but it was over a million two hundred thousand.
[00:38:03.254 --> 00:38:04.875]  And they just put innocent people on it.
[00:38:04.875 --> 00:38:06.896]  And now they say gun owners are going to be on it.
[00:38:06.896 --> 00:38:08.876]  If you got bad credit, you're going to be on it.
[00:38:08.876 --> 00:38:14.458]  But this guy's running around publicly at university two years ago saying, I want to carry out jihad.
[00:38:15.751 --> 00:38:20.834]  Clearly they're hired to try to flush out other Muslim students and set them up.
[00:38:20.834 --> 00:38:22.135]  Guaranteed.
[00:38:22.135 --> 00:38:23.656]  I saw this with McVeigh.
[00:38:23.656 --> 00:38:25.917]  We saw this with Lee Harvey Oswald.
[00:38:25.917 --> 00:38:28.158]  We saw this with Sirhan Sirhan.
[00:38:28.158 --> 00:38:30.360]  It never ends.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.720]  Muhammad Atta!
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.401]  Trained at U.S.
[00:38:32.401 --> 00:38:36.844]  military bases on record!
[00:38:36.844 --> 00:38:41.026]  And then the media just goes, oh, we're not going to discuss why they were trained at bases.
[00:38:41.026 --> 00:38:44.068]  All right, I'm going to shut up and let Watson finish and I'm going to get on to some other news.
[00:38:45.325 --> 00:38:47.526]  It's just, it's so obvious.
[00:38:47.526 --> 00:38:52.129]  I mean, Watson, the media always loves this psychology.
[00:38:52.129 --> 00:39:00.113]  I had Atlantic Monthly here a few weeks ago, and I had a bunch of other newspapers and magazines the last few weeks, and they always say the same cliché.
[00:39:00.113 --> 00:39:07.917]  They say, don't you just want to believe the government's doing this because that brings order to the world, and it's less scary than rogue terrorists?
[00:39:07.917 --> 00:39:09.138]  And I said, really?
[00:39:09.138 --> 00:39:14.521]  A government that runs my life and surveils everything I do, that has the power to destroy me through taxes,
[00:39:16.075 --> 00:39:20.937]  It's less scary to think random guys in a cave did this.
[00:39:20.937 --> 00:39:29.300]  It's a lot more scary to know the government did it, and that there's a giant police-state grid in place.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:35.002]  But it's that cliché of, oh, we just want to believe it's the government.
[00:39:35.002 --> 00:39:35.562]  No!
[00:39:35.562 --> 00:39:37.383]  I want to believe Al Qaeda's real!
[00:39:37.383 --> 00:39:38.343]  I want to believe it!
[00:39:39.912 --> 00:39:41.674]  But it's not true!
[00:39:41.674 --> 00:39:47.618]  Can you imagine knowing it's the government and having to get up on the radio and point this out?
[00:39:47.618 --> 00:39:51.622]  And have them run all their COINTELPRO operations against us?
[00:39:51.622 --> 00:39:53.704]  Can you imagine what this is like?
[00:39:53.704 --> 00:39:55.425]  But I've got to tell the truth here.
[00:39:55.425 --> 00:40:01.790]  Paul Watson, finish up with what's developing here and how it's being used.
[00:40:01.790 --> 00:40:03.132]  I mean, I have a BBC clip.
[00:40:03.956 --> 00:40:05.557]  And I have other TV clips from the U.S.
[00:40:05.557 --> 00:40:16.061]  where you can't put your hands in your lap, you can't cover your hands, you can't have a blanket, you can't get up to go to the bathroom, you can't have electronic devices, you've got to have the body scanners now.
[00:40:16.061 --> 00:40:28.667]  I mean, they're clearly selling this to set the precedent for total police state, super max level prison in the airports and planes now to be put on the streets of America, which the TSA admits they're doing.
[00:40:28.667 --> 00:40:31.788]  This is the total lockdown of the world, Watson!
[00:40:33.649 --> 00:40:49.152]  That's right, and to pick up on your previous point about how it's contrived and it's blown out of proportion when it's a government provocateur incident when compared to a lone nut, which do occasionally happen.
[00:40:49.152 --> 00:41:02.855]  There was a big bust in, well it was big but it wasn't reported as such, in England last year and they found a rocket launcher and plans to attack airliners at the home of this neo-Nazi.
[00:41:03.826 --> 00:41:11.048]  And it was because he was a white guy and it didn't fit into their, you know, Muslims are going to get us all picture book scenario.
[00:41:11.048 --> 00:41:15.370]  It got in one local newspaper and the story barely even went national, never mind.
[00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:19.291]  And of course it did turn out that that was part of a drill.
[00:41:19.291 --> 00:41:20.171]  99% of the time.
[00:41:20.171 --> 00:41:25.573]  It's like finding a four-leaf clover to actually find a real terror attack.
[00:41:25.573 --> 00:41:32.155]  99 plus percent of the time it's always a drill and they always hire some idiot to be part of the drill and then set them up.
[00:41:33.297 --> 00:41:40.380]  Right, and the propaganda that's emanated from this is clear how they've seized upon it.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:50.223]  The Associated Press is now reporting today, quote, Crippin and law enforcement officials said modern airport screening machines could have detected the chemical.
[00:41:50.223 --> 00:42:02.488]  Airport puffer machines, the devices that blow air onto passengers to collect and analyze residues, of course totally invasive, would probably have detected the powder, as would bomb-siffing dogs or hands-on search using a swab.
[00:42:03.012 --> 00:42:04.973]  You know, or maybe they just shouldn't let somebody on the plane.
[00:42:04.973 --> 00:42:06.534]  Which is what Maury Strong wants.
[00:42:06.534 --> 00:42:07.694]  Shut down travel.
[00:42:07.694 --> 00:42:08.775]  Track everything we're doing.
[00:42:08.775 --> 00:42:11.936]  Put global taxes on air travel.
[00:42:11.936 --> 00:42:15.758]  And, of course, they never point out that this guy was led through security.
[00:42:15.758 --> 00:42:19.720]  This guy was kept off the watch list, just like Mohammed Atta was.
[00:42:20.140 --> 00:42:25.201]  They don't ask why he was let on the plane when he's on a terror watch list and had no passport.
[00:42:25.201 --> 00:42:28.722]  It's all about how we now need to be oppressed because of it.
[00:42:28.722 --> 00:42:35.164]  And we need to give the globalist companies that make billions per nation a year off the new stupid machines.
[00:42:35.164 --> 00:42:39.705]  Right, which were in trouble because a lot of airports were starting to back away from them.
[00:42:39.705 --> 00:42:41.025]  And it continues.
[00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:43.346]  Yeah, because people aren't traveling!
[00:42:44.212 --> 00:42:52.844]  Yeah, I mean, business travellers are waiting up to four hours now, and they're just saying, I'm just not going to travel, so it's going to cripple the economy even further as well.
[00:42:52.844 --> 00:43:00.836]  But it says it continues, quote, however, most passengers in airports only go through magnetometers, which detect metal rather than explosives.
[00:43:03.124 --> 00:43:15.331]  And again, let's remind people, well, so we gotta have the body scanners.
[00:43:15.331 --> 00:43:19.693]  You can't refuse, because almost everybody's saying no to them now that they found out what they are.
[00:43:19.693 --> 00:43:20.914]  It can also cause cancer.
[00:43:20.914 --> 00:43:22.094]  It's high-powered.
[00:43:22.094 --> 00:43:24.336]  Thing shoots right through your clothes.
[00:43:24.336 --> 00:43:26.357]  But Watson, again,
[00:43:27.037 --> 00:43:33.241]  There's hardly any mention in our news that it's confirmed that he was walked through security without a passport.
[00:43:33.241 --> 00:43:35.102]  No one else can do that!
[00:43:35.102 --> 00:43:46.210]  Only, remember, Watson, you've got to, and again, I've only got Watson, I've only got Steve, I've only got Kurt and Aaron part-time on stories, because I can't find writers that understand the full spectrum of this.
[00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:47.551]  You're the guys that understand the M.O.
[00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:49.800]  Not that we're perfect.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.940]  I mean, it's sick.
[00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:54.241]  I mean, we're the best there is, and we're not even that good.
[00:43:54.241 --> 00:43:56.061]  But, I mean, you do a great job.
[00:43:56.061 --> 00:43:58.962]  My point is that there's so much more we should be doing.
[00:43:58.962 --> 00:44:16.465]  We need to give them the history of it, Paul, where Mohammed Adda and four other hijackers went to a Malaysian terror summit, and when they came back, Springman, the head of the Jetta Visa Bureau for the State Department, said they're on a terror index, and the CIA called up and said, let them in.
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:21.822]  They're really CIA agents.
[00:44:21.822 --> 00:44:24.004]  The terror designation is their cover.
[00:44:24.004 --> 00:44:25.626]  And, I mean, we interviewed Springman.
[00:44:25.626 --> 00:44:31.151]  He's in the film Fabled Enemies that I produced that's available at InfoWars.com.
[00:44:31.151 --> 00:44:32.493]  I interviewed him here on the radio.
[00:44:32.493 --> 00:44:34.375]  Just Google Alex Jones Springman.
[00:44:35.035 --> 00:44:36.836]  And you can find the articles about that.
[00:44:36.836 --> 00:44:39.877]  I mean, the point is, it's always the same.
[00:44:39.877 --> 00:44:45.380]  Don't listeners understand that Mohammed Adda and other hijackers were trained at U.S.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.581]  military bases in high-level spy training?
[00:44:48.581 --> 00:44:49.842]  Confirmed?
[00:44:49.842 --> 00:44:53.424]  Don't people understand it's always the same, Paul?
[00:44:53.424 --> 00:44:58.346]  I'm sorry, look, I got you on to go with the facts here because you're good at presenting them.
[00:44:58.346 --> 00:45:00.367]  Go back to how the AP and others are saying,
[00:45:01.431 --> 00:45:06.134]  Well, I mean, I've got this BBC report where they say you can't have your hands in your lap.
[00:45:06.134 --> 00:45:08.035]  You can't have a blanket now.
[00:45:08.035 --> 00:45:13.619]  No one... I mean, in a Supermax prison, you get to have a blanket, Paul!
[00:45:13.619 --> 00:45:20.203]  Well, even if you become ill, which people do on planes, because the food's terrible.
[00:45:20.203 --> 00:45:26.086]  Like, a man did yesterday, the Nigerian, he got ill, he went to the toilet, he was in there for a long time.
[00:45:26.086 --> 00:45:30.429]  Boom, it's the Joint Terrorism Task Force investigation, the FBI's in on it.
[00:45:31.444 --> 00:45:38.626]  Obama's notified that this man has been in the toilet for a while, and of course it all turns out to be absolutely nothing.
[00:45:38.626 --> 00:45:46.108]  It illustrates the absolute paranoia and all these orders that are now being made to obey as a result of it.
[00:45:46.108 --> 00:45:53.350]  But it's just like the liquid bombing plot in 2006, which of course was the entree for all these ridiculous measures on
[00:45:53.976 --> 00:45:58.138]  Yeah, but in that case, the bombers didn't have passports, they didn't have flight tickets, MI5 had been tracking them for months beforehand.
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:17.043]  And it was only as a result of a miscommunication between the U.S.
[00:46:17.043 --> 00:46:18.063]  and the U.K.
[00:46:18.063 --> 00:46:22.226]  that the whole story was blown wide open before they boarded the plane.
[00:46:22.226 --> 00:46:23.347]  Let me stop you again.
[00:46:23.347 --> 00:46:24.248]  Let me stop you again.
[00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:32.354]  Again, they don't have passports, anything, because they're always brought directly on by security.
[00:46:32.354 --> 00:46:39.359]  Let me tell the TSA, if you're not part of the terrorists, and the average TSA person is going to make $15 an hour, has no idea what's going on.
[00:46:39.359 --> 00:46:42.782]  Okay, if you see security leading a Muslim through
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:59.628]  Yeah, so, I mean, MI5 were tracking these guys for months, and they knew the exact date of when they planned to do it, and that they were about to let them on the plane.
[00:46:59.628 --> 00:47:02.730]  There was a miscommunication between the U.S.
[00:47:02.730 --> 00:47:06.552]  The story got blown wide open, and they didn't get on the plane.
[00:47:06.552 --> 00:47:11.174]  That one was supposed to go ahead, but even as a result of just the scare alone, of course,
[00:47:11.752 --> 00:47:15.073]  Three or four years later, we've still got these ridiculous measures.
[00:47:15.073 --> 00:47:20.055]  You know, which, how much will obey to what ridiculous farce level will obey?
[00:47:20.055 --> 00:47:23.556]  And that's only being ramped up now as a result of this latest one.
[00:47:23.556 --> 00:47:25.597]  As you said, you've got to sit down for the final hour.
[00:47:25.597 --> 00:47:27.997]  And what they did is they recruited, this will be the M.O.
[00:47:27.997 --> 00:47:35.200]  when it finally all comes out, just like we said a year ago, and now here it is, London Telegraph, front page, Mumbai suspect is U.S.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.640]  double agent.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:38.301]  Ha ha ha ha.
[00:47:38.301 --> 00:47:38.941]  Ha ha ha.
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:45.583]  An American man charged with plotting the attacks in Mumbai was a double agent for both the United States and Al-Qaeda terror group.
[00:47:45.583 --> 00:47:48.165]  That's how they always cover it when it comes out that they're U.S.
[00:47:48.165 --> 00:47:48.525]  agents.
[00:47:48.525 --> 00:47:50.866]  Oh, well, he was a double agent.
[00:47:50.866 --> 00:47:52.767]  No, it was a globalist agent.
[00:47:52.767 --> 00:47:57.930]  Now, I think it's safe to say that this is clearly staged.
[00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:02.213]  Now that you have the guy on board videotaping the entire flight.
[00:48:02.975 --> 00:48:06.557]  In front of everyone and the stewardess is leaving him alone to videotape him.
[00:48:06.557 --> 00:48:09.259]  Paul, it's always the same M.O.
[00:48:09.259 --> 00:48:11.921]  and we know that this is what happened.
[00:48:11.921 --> 00:48:15.783]  They recruited him out of college and said, we need you to watch Muslim extremists.
[00:48:15.783 --> 00:48:20.406]  We want you to talk about how you're going to stage terror attacks in class.
[00:48:20.406 --> 00:48:24.248]  We want you to talk about how you love Al-Qaeda and the Taliban to flush out terrorists.
[00:48:24.248 --> 00:48:28.311]  Your dad's a very powerful person, one of the top bankers, works with us.
[00:48:28.311 --> 00:48:29.552]  Are you willing to do this for us?
[00:48:30.831 --> 00:48:33.414]  Yes, I want to fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:48:33.414 --> 00:48:45.105]  Okay, and then here he is, an agent, two years later, been all over the world working for these people, and they said, we need to test getting a bomb on a plane to see if stewardesses noticed that you made a liquid bomb inside the urinal.
[00:48:45.105 --> 00:48:49.910]  Now, we understand, and again, how many times has the BATF and others been caught sneaking fake bombs on?
[00:48:50.902 --> 00:48:52.742]  I mean, it's blatant, it's transparent.
[00:48:52.742 --> 00:48:56.583]  And now you've got Joe Lieberman saying we need to attack Yemen.
[00:48:56.583 --> 00:49:01.104]  And surprise, surprise, they're now connecting it to Yemen and saying that now that's the home of Al-Qaeda.
[00:49:19.947 --> 00:49:22.050]  After Afghanistan, now they're all in Yemen.
[00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:24.214]  I guess we need to smart-bomb Yemen, don't we?
[00:49:26.889 --> 00:49:28.850]  There's really no end to this, Watson.
[00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:30.571]  There literally is no end.
[00:49:30.571 --> 00:49:45.799]  Well, there's a lot of other points I'll go over later on this, but we need really strong headlines with just data boildowns that 99% chance this is completely staged, it follows the past MO.
[00:49:45.799 --> 00:49:48.720]  I mean, write the article if you agree with me.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.561]  I mean, this is authoritative, isn't it?
[00:49:51.561 --> 00:49:52.362]  Yeah.
[00:49:53.186 --> 00:49:59.211]  Every single plot that we've tracked has led back to these terrorists being handled by people in U.S.
[00:49:59.211 --> 00:49:59.872]  intelligence.
[00:49:59.872 --> 00:50:03.035]  I mean, there's no major plot that hasn't led back to that.
[00:50:03.035 --> 00:50:06.398]  They're always led onto the airplanes.
[00:50:06.398 --> 00:50:07.799]  They never have to have passports.
[00:50:07.799 --> 00:50:11.923]  They're always trained at military bases with high-level spy clearances.
[00:50:11.923 --> 00:50:16.847]  Oh, but if you're, you know, a family or grandma or whatever, then you're going to get harassed.
[00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:20.150]  Maybe the best way to get through airport security is just to have a handler.
[00:50:20.798 --> 00:50:24.079]  Um, some explosives, no passport, and then you'll breeze right through.
[00:50:24.079 --> 00:50:25.340]  Well, that's the start.
[00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:33.123]  If you're coming out of a Muslim country with explosives, as long as Interpol walks you through, then it's fine, yeah.
[00:50:33.123 --> 00:50:36.084]  Watson, can you believe Interpol is going to be able to operate in the U.S.
[00:50:36.084 --> 00:50:39.185]  with total immunity?
[00:50:39.185 --> 00:50:45.688]  Well, no, the harmonization of law enforcement is one of the key goals of world government, so it's no surprise.
[00:50:46.536 --> 00:50:53.679]  They've been doing it for decades through the Esher One system with the buying cadres in every country.
[00:50:53.679 --> 00:50:55.440]  Well, good job over at Prison Planet.
[00:50:55.440 --> 00:50:56.820]  Good job to Kurt Nemo as well.
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:57.720]  Thank you, Paul.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:58.861]  We'll be back with more news.
[00:50:58.861 --> 00:51:01.762]  Thank you, Paul.
[00:51:01.762 --> 00:51:06.904]  Studies have shown that many people do not get the proper vitamins and minerals necessary to maintain good health.
[00:51:06.904 --> 00:51:12.566]  With so many places to choose from, deciding where and what to buy can be a lengthy, frustrating process.
[00:51:12.566 --> 00:51:13.627]  The answer is simple.
[00:51:16.698 --> 00:51:17.218]  We're good to go.
[00:51:42.295 --> 00:51:45.337]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:51:45.337 --> 00:51:47.298]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:47.298 --> 00:51:48.959]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:12.176 --> 00:52:14.858]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.858 --> 00:52:21.224]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:21.224 --> 00:52:26.788]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:26.788 --> 00:52:36.416]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:36.536 --> 00:52:38.877]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.877 --> 00:52:40.457]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:42.918]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.918 --> 00:52:45.038]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:45.038 --> 00:52:50.200]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:55.201]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:55.201 --> 00:52:59.303]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:01.536 --> 00:53:04.920]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:08.825]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:53:08.825 --> 00:53:12.549]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:53:12.549 --> 00:53:19.497]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,
[00:53:21.556 --> 00:53:27.701]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.
[00:53:27.701 --> 00:53:32.544]  From the smallest to the largest systems, BigBerkyWaterFilters.com has what you need.
[00:53:32.544 --> 00:53:39.009]  With your system purchase, you'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berky bottles absolutely free.
[00:53:39.009 --> 00:53:48.777]  BigBerkyWaterFilters.com would like to offer GCN listeners 5% off all ceramic filter systems and ship all orders over $50 free of charge.
[00:53:48.777 --> 00:53:50.418]  Visit BigBerkyWaterFilters.com
[00:53:50.418 --> 00:53:51.518]  You see, the way tyranny works,
[00:54:17.122 --> 00:54:23.086]  Is that it carries out thousands of little insults to freedom.
[00:54:23.086 --> 00:54:29.611]  And it slowly sets the precedent that the government is God, the police are God, the system can't be questioned.
[00:54:29.611 --> 00:54:35.214]  And when they set up the National Security Dictatorship in 1947, that was the beginning of the end.
[00:54:35.214 --> 00:54:41.419]  Imagine the CIA and other agencies could operate with unlimited funds in secret.
[00:54:41.419 --> 00:54:44.461]  What would happen if you told your employees, let's say you owned a
[00:54:46.966 --> 00:54:48.807]  Restaurant.
[00:54:48.807 --> 00:54:55.128]  And you told your employees and your managers, oh, you can operate in secret and do whatever you want and there'll be no oversight and you have total immunity.
[00:54:55.128 --> 00:54:57.829]  They'd rob you blind.
[00:54:57.829 --> 00:55:04.391]  And we've been robbed, and now they're staging terror attacks to set up the police state.
[00:55:04.391 --> 00:55:13.033]  And every stinking time, they walk the person on the plane, they protect them, the person thinks they're part of a drill.
[00:55:14.994 --> 00:55:23.320]  Remember the James Woods clip when he went on Fox and talked about a week before 9-11, Muhammad Atta and four other guys were on the plane doing drills for hijacking the plane.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:32.007]  He gets off the airplane, tells the FBI, they come to him and say, well, you need to keep your mouth shut about this.
[00:55:32.007 --> 00:55:36.710]  Then after 9-11, they show up at his house.
[00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:37.411]  The FBI does.
[00:55:40.216 --> 00:55:45.881]  You understand it's in the Associated Press and in Newsweek, but they just report it like it's no big deal?
[00:55:45.881 --> 00:55:49.684]  Yeah, Mohammed Adda and others were trained in spy training at U.S.
[00:55:49.684 --> 00:55:51.345]  bases.
[00:55:51.345 --> 00:55:56.990]  And this colonel, who was the head of the base, he says the government's involved in the attacks because these guys were U.S.
[00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:58.291]  government agents.
[00:55:58.291 --> 00:55:59.632]  Something's going on.
[00:55:59.632 --> 00:56:02.274]  How dare the colonel question?
[00:56:07.993 --> 00:56:10.434]  I have interviewed the head of the U.S.
[00:56:10.434 --> 00:56:17.236]  Embassy, who wouldn't let Atta and others in, and was ordered to let them in and told, they're CIA!
[00:56:17.236 --> 00:56:22.058]  Their terror designation is a cover!
[00:56:22.058 --> 00:56:26.000]  Now what exactly happened on 9-11, I don't know!
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:29.481]  But I know one thing, intelligence had its fingerprints all over it!
[00:56:30.558 --> 00:56:40.344]  And they sure had the motive to take our liberties and freedoms and launch all these wars, just like Dick Cheney wrote in the September 20, 2000 PNAC document, rebuilding America's defenses.
[00:56:40.344 --> 00:56:45.888]  Facts are facts!
[00:56:45.888 --> 00:56:48.689]  And none of us are safe while this continues!
[00:56:48.689 --> 00:56:54.453]  If these guys could get away with 9-11, of course they're going to get away with stealing your pension funds blind.
[00:56:54.453 --> 00:56:55.914]  Of course they're going to get away with saying,
[00:56:57.262 --> 00:57:02.588]  Interpol is above the law and can do whatever it wants in the United States.
[00:57:02.588 --> 00:57:03.329]  Alright, here's the deal.
[00:57:04.775 --> 00:57:06.536]  I haven't even gotten into health care.
[00:57:06.536 --> 00:57:08.797]  Notice this is also a great diversion from health care.
[00:57:08.797 --> 00:57:11.019]  So people don't actually look.
[00:57:11.019 --> 00:57:16.082]  Every day that passes, more people turn against government-run health care as they read the bill.
[00:57:16.082 --> 00:57:24.647]  But now as it goes into conference committee between the House and Senate, nobody's talking about health care now because everyone's hyperventilating and the president's being woken up from naps.
[00:57:24.647 --> 00:57:26.748]  Sir, someone was in a bathroom for 20 minutes.
[00:57:32.057 --> 00:57:35.019]  America and the world is on the edge of collapse.
[00:57:35.019 --> 00:57:36.220]  Everyone is in fear.
[00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:37.641]  Everyone is a prisoner.
[00:57:37.641 --> 00:57:42.504]  Because somebody set off a firecracker on an airplane.
[00:57:42.504 --> 00:57:46.426]  But no one discusses why he was led onto the plane by security.
[00:57:46.426 --> 00:57:51.029]  No one asked why someone was there videotaping him the entire time in front of everyone.
[00:57:51.029 --> 00:57:52.290]  In full view.
[00:57:52.290 --> 00:57:54.932]  That was to make the stupid patsy feel safe.
[00:57:54.932 --> 00:57:56.153]  Okay, I'm being filmed.
[00:57:56.153 --> 00:57:57.734]  Okay, it's a drill.
[00:57:57.734 --> 00:57:59.795]  Okay.
[00:57:59.795 --> 00:58:01.296]  And then the guy was stunned when it went off.
[00:58:04.693 --> 00:58:07.194]  Same thing with McVeigh.
[00:58:07.194 --> 00:58:10.116]  McVeigh, they're sworn federal affidavits now.
[00:58:10.116 --> 00:58:18.400]  In court record that McVeigh told his lawyers, look, I was deep intel, I was hired to infiltrate militias, I was set up.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:21.761]  And see, McVeigh didn't want to bomb the daycare center.
[00:58:21.761 --> 00:58:26.204]  It's kind of like Tony Montana and Scarface, didn't want to blow up the car with little kids in it.
[00:58:26.204 --> 00:58:33.147]  And so they believe that's why he was chosen as the patsy, because two weeks before he threw a fit and said, I'm not taking part in blowing up a daycare center.
[00:58:34.557 --> 00:58:37.019]  That's the fans, folks.
[00:58:37.019 --> 00:58:37.840]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:43.625]  Stay with us.

[00:58:50.888 --> 00:58:56.215]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:56.215 --> 00:59:00.741]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:59:00.741 --> 00:59:03.024]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:03.024 --> 00:59:04.646]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:59:04.646 --> 00:59:05.688]  There is a solution.

[00:59:54.071 --> 00:59:56.473]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.473 --> 01:00:05.879]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.879 --> 01:00:07.179]  Big Brother.
[01:00:07.179 --> 01:00:08.940]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.702]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.702 --> 01:00:12.283]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.283 --> 01:00:13.844]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:18.026]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.026 --> 01:00:22.089]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.799 --> 01:00:31.004]  I'm gonna get into the healthcare takeover that we're just days away from, the nightmare bill.
[01:00:31.004 --> 01:00:44.316]  I wanna get into the economy, the police state, the staged airport event where the media's got everyone hyperventilating, land of the free, home of the brave.
[01:00:44.316 --> 01:00:49.021]  People are ready to just throw themselves off cliffs to hide from the deadly firecracker bomber.
[01:00:52.805 --> 01:00:54.667]  Stampeding in wild-eyed fear.
[01:00:54.667 --> 01:00:57.989]  At least the media is trying to sell it.
[01:00:57.989 --> 01:01:08.839]  Don't forget the White House, head of Homeland Security, Ridge, admitted, what we already knew, that the White House would issue fake terror alerts for political gain.
[01:01:08.839 --> 01:01:11.081]  What do you think this is?
[01:01:11.081 --> 01:01:15.564]  You think it was going to change with Obama?
[01:01:15.564 --> 01:01:20.769]  I want to open the phones up on the plane bomber for first-time callers today.
[01:01:22.827 --> 01:01:29.271]  First-time callers, or on the economy, or healthcare, any issue you wish to discuss are in our poll.
[01:01:29.271 --> 01:01:34.433]  I'm going to get into more detail on that being given total immunity.
[01:01:34.433 --> 01:01:43.578]  And this isn't like police immunity, fake immunity the government claims for police, you know, if they're doing it under their office.
[01:01:43.578 --> 01:01:51.543]  This is UN immunity, where the UN's been caught with house slaves, you name it, in the US and nothing's done to them.
[01:01:53.339 --> 01:01:54.520]  And nobody prosecutes them.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:57.902]  I'm going to explain how this criminal network works coming up.
[01:01:57.902 --> 01:02:00.183]  I want to get your calls on all these subjects at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:02.404]  We are live the 28th day of December 2009 on this Monday edition.
[01:02:02.404 --> 01:02:02.465]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:14.784 --> 01:02:19.987]  It really is mind-blowing, though, how openly obvious.
[01:02:19.987 --> 01:02:36.956]  I mean, there's no other way for a thinking person who has one micron of intelligence to be able to look at this latest underwear bomber, syringe bomber,
[01:02:38.877 --> 01:02:40.799]  Ooh, that's got a scary sounding name.
[01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:45.283]  There's no way to look at this and not know the only thing it can be is government.
[01:02:45.283 --> 01:02:58.174]  He's led by some security person in a suit past all the security and put on board the aircraft and then someone sits there in plain view from start to finish videotaping him.
[01:02:58.174 --> 01:02:59.035]  The entire flight.
[01:03:00.165 --> 01:03:03.847]  We put a call in to the lawyer, who's one of the witnesses of this, who's talked to the news.
[01:03:03.847 --> 01:03:04.927]  We're trying to get him on.
[01:03:04.927 --> 01:03:07.108]  In fact, Jaren, just keep calling him.
[01:03:07.108 --> 01:03:15.752]  Squeaky wheel will get the grease.
[01:03:15.752 --> 01:03:17.153]  Just, when does it end?
[01:03:17.153 --> 01:03:18.774]  When does the corruption end?
[01:03:18.774 --> 01:03:20.995]  When does this open criminal government end?
[01:03:20.995 --> 01:03:24.677]  When does it stop?
[01:03:24.677 --> 01:03:25.177]  It stops
[01:03:26.374 --> 01:03:31.838]  When the people realize there's no polishing, you know what?
[01:03:31.838 --> 01:03:35.160]  There's no putting perfume on a pig.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:39.863]  You can put lipstick on a pig, it's still a pig.
[01:03:39.863 --> 01:03:45.427]  If your house burns down, you can't go wallow around in the ashes and make believe that your house is still there.
[01:03:45.427 --> 01:03:47.888]  Ladies and gentlemen, our government is illegitimate.
[01:03:47.888 --> 01:03:52.091]  The planetary government is a corporate government designed to loot and steal.
[01:03:52.091 --> 01:03:56.074]  The globalists are a bunch of inbred, ruthless people that see us as lower than animals.
[01:03:57.403 --> 01:04:01.886]  Who compete with each other over who can be the most psychopathic and ruthless.
[01:04:01.886 --> 01:04:09.312]  And they've got fancy PR firms putting out high-tech propaganda to brainwash the public.
[01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:11.233]  But we don't just have the evil elite.
[01:04:11.233 --> 01:04:20.220]  We have a decadent, dumbed-down, entitled mass of cowards and scum that make up the general public.
[01:04:20.220 --> 01:04:26.424]  Ninnies who think corruption is cute and think that anyone warning them about corruption is funny.
[01:04:27.245 --> 01:04:29.967]  And they have no idea what's happening to them.
[01:04:29.967 --> 01:04:39.314]  Now in the middle is maybe 20-30% of the population who are good, hardworking, decent, smart, connected to God people, who understand and have discernment.
[01:04:39.314 --> 01:04:40.435]  And we are the enemy.
[01:04:40.435 --> 01:04:49.262]  We are the enemy of the cattle, and we are the enemy of the wolves.
[01:04:49.262 --> 01:04:54.486]  The cowardly population makes war against anything good and decent because they see it as responsibility.
[01:04:55.834 --> 01:04:56.994]  God help us, man.
[01:04:56.994 --> 01:05:00.935]  It's gonna make the Soviet Union look like a tea party.
[01:05:00.935 --> 01:05:05.497]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.497 --> 01:05:06.397]  Number one.
[01:05:06.397 --> 01:05:09.818]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.818 --> 01:05:10.678]  Number two.
[01:05:10.678 --> 01:05:15.579]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:16.320]  It's true.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:20.861]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:21.181 --> 01:05:22.001]  Number 3.
[01:05:22.001 --> 01:05:25.582]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.582 --> 01:05:29.503]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.503 --> 01:05:30.303]  Number 4.
[01:05:30.303 --> 01:05:33.064]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:33.064 --> 01:05:36.745]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.745 --> 01:05:37.545]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.545 --> 01:05:41.686]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.686 --> 01:05:46.447]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.727 --> 01:05:50.913]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:52.695]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.695 --> 01:05:54.958]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:57.302]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:01.465 --> 01:06:04.467]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:04.467 --> 01:06:09.792]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.792 --> 01:06:11.853]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.853 --> 01:06:16.858]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.858 --> 01:06:18.038]  How much do you want?
[01:06:18.038 --> 01:06:19.159]  When do you want it?
[01:06:19.159 --> 01:06:21.041]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:22.122]  When will you need it?
[01:06:22.122 --> 01:06:24.324]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:24.324 --> 01:06:25.665]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.665 --> 01:06:27.186]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:27.186 --> 01:06:27.346]  If there
[01:06:27.346 --> 01:06:29.707]  There's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself.
[01:06:29.707 --> 01:06:32.428]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:32.428 --> 01:06:36.010]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:36.010 --> 01:06:39.832]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.832 --> 01:06:41.072]  How much will you need?
[01:06:41.072 --> 01:06:41.973]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.973 --> 01:06:43.073]  How much do you want?
[01:06:43.073 --> 01:06:44.014]  All you can get.
[01:06:44.014 --> 01:06:44.814]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:45.094 --> 01:06:48.139]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:48.139 --> 01:06:50.382]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:50.382 --> 01:06:51.363]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:00.396 --> 01:07:05.703]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:07:05.703 --> 01:07:07.786]  Will you continue to be their profit center?
[01:07:07.786 --> 01:07:10.229]  Buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:07:10.229 --> 01:07:12.512]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:07:12.512 --> 01:07:14.134]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:07:14.134 --> 01:07:15.176]  There is a solution.
[01:07:15.396 --> 01:07:23.824]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:07:37.296 --> 01:07:43.322]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[01:08:02.373 --> 01:08:05.135]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:05.135 --> 01:08:15.602]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:15.602 --> 01:08:21.946]  Godfrey Bloom, European Union Member of Parliament, will be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[01:08:21.946 --> 01:08:24.108]  He's an outspoken critic of world government.
[01:08:24.108 --> 01:08:28.291]  He'll give us an inside view on what the main head of the Hydra
[01:08:29.133 --> 01:08:31.957]  The King head, the EU, is up to.
[01:08:31.957 --> 01:08:38.605]  We're going to have open phones from Brad, Tim, Chris, Steve, Curtis and others in this hour.
[01:08:38.605 --> 01:08:40.827]  I'm going to go back through all the latest.
[01:08:41.887 --> 01:08:49.013]  On the underwear bomber and how there is no doubt this is completely staged as a pretext to take our liberties and freedoms.
[01:08:49.013 --> 01:08:53.937]  There is no doubt it fits all the same MO from the past.
[01:08:53.937 --> 01:08:56.118]  Also government-run health care.
[01:08:56.118 --> 01:09:02.003]  Obama giving complete immunity to Interpol, something the FBI doesn't even have inside this country.
[01:09:02.003 --> 01:09:09.749]  I want to break down how these internationalists have made themselves above the law and are now absorbing our court system.
[01:09:12.216 --> 01:09:16.557]  Just incredibly outrageous.
[01:09:16.557 --> 01:09:22.799]  So that is coming up.
[01:09:22.799 --> 01:09:40.784]  Before I go to your phone calls, I wanted to just let the listeners know that it'll take us a week or so, we're a small operation, to take the Christmas specials, the holiday specials, down from InfoWars.com.
[01:09:44.025 --> 01:09:49.088]  We have deals up there right now where you can get a free Obama as the Joker t-shirt.
[01:09:49.088 --> 01:09:53.612]  It's great for meeting like-minded people on the street.
[01:09:53.612 --> 01:09:58.035]  We also have Don't Tread on Me shirts that are free at Infowars.com.
[01:09:58.035 --> 01:10:04.799]  When you get Fall of the Republic on DVD for $19.95, you get a free t-shirt.
[01:10:04.799 --> 01:10:08.642]  We have other deals where you can get Endgame for free or Reflections and Warnings for free.
[01:10:10.882 --> 01:10:18.069]  Those specials are going to go away in the next week.
[01:10:18.069 --> 01:10:23.274]  They are going to go away.
[01:10:23.274 --> 01:10:28.459]  And so if you want to take advantage, and that's just a few of the specials, there's a whole bunch of them.
[01:10:28.459 --> 01:10:32.522]  Go to InfoWars.com, go to PrisonPlanet.com, at the top of the page you see a banner
[01:10:33.359 --> 01:10:33.859]  That's great.
[01:10:57.904 --> 01:11:03.146]  And so I would challenge folks out there to take advantage of these specials while they're running.
[01:11:03.146 --> 01:11:12.950]  You can also call Toll Free and tell them you want the free t-shirt deal, and tell them which video you want with it, what video you want to buy, and they get the free t-shirt.
[01:11:12.950 --> 01:11:13.511]  888-253-3139.
[01:11:13.511 --> 01:11:13.571]  888-253-3139.
[01:11:13.571 --> 01:11:15.571]  And yes, we always run it into the New Year.
[01:11:25.822 --> 01:11:29.243]  Generally into the first week of January, so you've got a week or so to sign up.
[01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:30.444]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:30.444 --> 01:11:34.665]  You can still get five and a half months for free at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:44.009]  We simulcast the last two hours, at least some days, the entire four-hour radio show in multimedia via television at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:11:44.009 --> 01:11:47.010]  My book, Paul Watson's book, all my films are super high quality.
[01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:51.192]  It's a great activist tool to go download the films, burn them to divx, give them to people.
[01:11:51.192 --> 01:11:54.293]  PrisonPlanet.tv and your 15 cent a day membership
[01:11:54.753 --> 01:11:59.775]  Well, it's even less if you get the five months free.
[01:11:59.775 --> 01:12:02.577]  What is it, like 10 cents or less a day?
[01:12:02.577 --> 01:12:07.659]  Also funds our operations, so I want to thank everybody that does financially support us out there.
[01:12:07.659 --> 01:12:08.459]  Thank you so much.
[01:12:08.459 --> 01:12:12.441]  So again, PrisonPlanet.tv, a special running there as well.
[01:12:12.441 --> 01:12:14.502]  You can also write to us, InfoWars, at P.O.
[01:12:14.502 --> 01:12:14.962]  Box 19549.
[01:12:14.962 --> 01:12:15.462]  That's P.O.
[01:12:15.462 --> 01:12:16.303]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas, 78760.
[01:12:24.932 --> 01:12:29.276]  Alright, I'm going to go to your phone calls now.
[01:12:29.276 --> 01:12:34.161]  But it really does weigh on me, and I know it weighs on you.
[01:12:34.161 --> 01:12:46.132]  When I took off last Wednesday and saw the Interpol article, and then went and read the executive order, I'm not even angry anymore, I'm more just sad.
[01:12:46.132 --> 01:12:48.634]  This is so humiliating, it's so unconstitutional.
[01:12:52.594 --> 01:12:59.277]  And when I saw the underwear bomber and how this was staged, I was like, it's staged again.
[01:12:59.277 --> 01:13:02.258]  I wish it was real terrorist.
[01:13:02.258 --> 01:13:07.120]  I'm not afraid of some lone nut trying to go on an airplane and blow themselves up.
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.842]  Statistically, I got a better chance of drowning or being struck by lightning.
[01:13:11.842 --> 01:13:20.325]  But man, to know the government really is criminal and really did stage it, it just never ends.
[01:13:20.325 --> 01:13:21.526]  I'm just so tired of it.
[01:13:22.639 --> 01:13:31.221]  And all these lackeys in mainstream media who ally themselves with the corporate system and the lies and who attack us and lie about us, those of us that tell the truth.
[01:13:31.221 --> 01:13:32.341]  I don't even hate them anymore.
[01:13:32.341 --> 01:13:35.322]  I just feel sorry for them.
[01:13:35.322 --> 01:13:41.123]  Our fellow man is so demon-like.
[01:13:41.123 --> 01:13:42.303]  Alright, I'm going to your calls.
[01:13:42.303 --> 01:13:44.984]  Brad, Tim, Chris, Steve, Curtis, Blake, and others.
[01:13:46.192 --> 01:13:47.393]  Tim just hung up.
[01:13:47.393 --> 01:13:49.435]  First time callers, at least in the next few hours.
[01:13:49.435 --> 01:13:50.096]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:13:50.096 --> 01:13:53.479]  Brad in Kansas.
[01:13:53.479 --> 01:13:54.060]  You're on the air.
[01:13:54.060 --> 01:13:54.480]  Go ahead.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.342]  Hey Alex.
[01:13:56.342 --> 01:13:59.766]  I might have some good news for you.
[01:13:59.766 --> 01:14:05.511]  I was on my way into work today and had Rush Limbaugh's show on in the vehicle.
[01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:11.671]  There was a guy by the name of Mark Stein that was sitting in for us over the holiday.
[01:14:11.671 --> 01:14:20.892]  Yeah, he is a known operative of the CIA-created National Review, who Limbaugh admits put him in the power.
[01:14:20.892 --> 01:14:23.933]  So what was the officer saying?
[01:14:23.933 --> 01:14:25.853]  What was the agent saying?
[01:14:25.853 --> 01:14:34.115]  Well, actually, he brought up Charlie Sheen and mentioned him having some sort of domestic issues and having been arrested or coming out of jail or something.
[01:14:34.915 --> 01:14:44.318]  And then he talked about how Charlie Sheen was a 9-11 truther and how he had the courage to speak the truth about it, being an inside job and everything.
[01:14:44.318 --> 01:14:49.740]  And then was basically alluding to his arrest, there being more to the story there.
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:51.540]  He was being sarcastic.
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.401]  He was being sarcastic.
[01:14:53.401 --> 01:14:54.241]  Oh man.
[01:14:54.241 --> 01:14:57.842]  He was saying he got arrested for doing that.
[01:14:57.842 --> 01:15:00.223]  Yeah, he was acting like there was more to the story too.
[01:15:00.223 --> 01:15:03.864]  By the way, when I say National Review is CIA, that's on record.
[01:15:05.356 --> 01:15:09.759]  High-level black ops.
[01:15:09.759 --> 01:15:28.371]  Well, listen, we'll try to find the clip, but I actually have in front of me, Saturday, December 26, 2009, Let's Roll 2 from National Review, Mark Stein's National Review blog, where he makes fun of Charlie Sheen and ties him in with the underwear bomber.
[01:15:29.392 --> 01:15:34.958]  It says, uh, this time the last line of defense worked, talking about how citizens stood up and took action.
[01:15:34.958 --> 01:15:36.900]  Which is true.
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:42.787]  Though the flight attendant screamed and yelled and said, sit down, sit down, sit down.
[01:15:42.787 --> 01:15:43.347]  Next time...
[01:15:44.557 --> 01:15:46.178]  Yeah, I can see what you're saying there.
[01:16:14.434 --> 01:16:16.175]  He was being sarcastic.
[01:16:16.175 --> 01:16:19.498]  But listen, Brad, I appreciate your call.
[01:16:19.498 --> 01:16:20.099]  I appreciate it.
[01:16:20.099 --> 01:16:23.261]  No, I understand.
[01:16:23.261 --> 01:16:24.002]  Good to hear from you, though.
[01:16:24.002 --> 01:16:24.803]  I'm glad you called.
[01:16:24.803 --> 01:16:26.204]  I'm glad I could fill you in on that.
[01:16:26.204 --> 01:16:29.266]  It was sarcasm.
[01:16:29.266 --> 01:16:32.669]  But see, these guys are so delusional.
[01:16:32.669 --> 01:16:34.390]  Well, they're not really delusional.
[01:16:34.390 --> 01:16:39.575]  When Limbaugh gets up there and says there is no world government, there is no plan for a planetary government,
[01:16:40.666 --> 01:16:48.133]  Or when Sean Hannity says Ron Paul supporters are dangerous kooks, there is no world government.
[01:16:48.133 --> 01:16:58.001]  When they do that, they know full well hundreds of news articles a day announce world government and a private banking system to run it.
[01:16:58.001 --> 01:17:05.168]  But they have such a low view of their listeners that they're saying to their listeners, it's not kosher.
[01:17:05.168 --> 01:17:06.629]  It's not acceptable.
[01:17:06.629 --> 01:17:07.670]  It's not palatable.
[01:17:10.441 --> 01:17:12.923]  To pass gas in church.
[01:17:12.923 --> 01:17:17.287]  Or to talk about New World Order.
[01:17:17.287 --> 01:17:21.231]  So they're there telling you you're a kook.
[01:17:21.231 --> 01:17:27.316]  I mean, what does Chris Matthews do when he says, if you don't like big government, you don't like black people.
[01:17:27.316 --> 01:17:30.319]  If you say socialism, that means you're a cross-burner.
[01:17:30.319 --> 01:17:31.600]  I mean, these are quotes.
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:57.544]  They are the real racist injecting race to divide and conquer and control and they have such a low view of their audience they're saying it's politically incorrect to criticize Saul Alinsky openly saying he wanted to put you in re-education camps and being Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama's mentor.
[01:17:57.544 --> 01:18:04.125]  You are not allowed to say you don't want the government putting you in jail for five years if you don't get insurance.
[01:18:07.093 --> 01:18:08.575]  You're a racist!
[01:18:08.575 --> 01:18:10.336]  What does the ADL say?
[01:18:10.336 --> 01:18:12.399]  Oh, you don't like the Federal Reserve robbing you?
[01:18:12.399 --> 01:18:13.460]  You're a racist!
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:16.002]  And they inject the issue.
[01:18:16.002 --> 01:18:18.645]  They inject it.
[01:18:18.645 --> 01:18:23.730]  Just like the FBI's been caught scores of times running all the major white supremacist groups.
[01:18:24.554 --> 01:18:46.809]  Who want to radicalize the discussion and make any patriotic discussion so anti-semitic and so cartoonish with black jackboots and shaved heads and drunks going Sieg Heil that mainline people never come into the fight against the New World Order because the feds and the ADL went around dropping rat droppings into the mix.
[01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:50.232]  It's like one rat dropping in a bowl of spaghetti ruins it.
[01:18:54.244 --> 01:18:57.865]  They put rat droppings in it!
[01:18:57.865 --> 01:19:02.227]  And a lot of gullible idiots buy into it and get tracked and traced and controlled by it.
[01:19:02.227 --> 01:19:04.788]  Not me!
[01:19:04.788 --> 01:19:10.550]  I see through all of it.
[01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:21.654]  As for Charlie Sheen, it's in the news that his wife says that she was completely drunk, and the police did test her blood and that was the case, and that he did not assault her.
[01:19:21.654 --> 01:19:23.395]  Oh, he's been charged with assaulting her.
[01:19:29.594 --> 01:19:33.355]  And so that's how this works.
[01:19:33.355 --> 01:19:40.036]  That's how this works.
[01:19:40.036 --> 01:19:42.997]  I know Charlie Sheen very, very well.
[01:19:42.997 --> 01:19:48.679]  And there's all these people out there who will get off on hating him.
[01:19:48.679 --> 01:19:54.800]  Hey, hating Charlie Sheen isn't going to get you out of that efficiency apartment.
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:58.381]  Taking on the New World Order will.
[01:19:58.381 --> 01:19:59.001]  You understand that?
[01:20:01.485 --> 01:20:05.028]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:20:05.028 --> 01:20:07.310]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:20:07.310 --> 01:20:08.171]  Don't!
[01:20:08.171 --> 01:20:11.613]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:20:11.613 --> 01:20:18.759]  Why pay, when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:20:18.739 --> 01:20:20.721]  's number one debt secret.
[01:20:20.721 --> 01:20:24.804]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:20:24.804 --> 01:20:27.487]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:35.290]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:20:35.290 --> 01:20:36.471]  Herb K. was right.
[01:20:36.471 --> 01:20:39.652]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:20:39.652 --> 01:20:41.013]  What have you got to lose?
[01:20:41.013 --> 01:20:44.714]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[01:20:44.714 --> 01:20:45.335]  Get Herb K.'
[01:20:45.255 --> 01:20:48.656]  's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:20:48.656 --> 01:20:49.016]  Call 888-352-7726.
[01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:53.518]  That's 888-352-7726.
[01:20:53.518 --> 01:20:53.578]  888-352-7726.
[01:20:53.578 --> 01:20:56.699]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:20:56.699 --> 01:20:59.040]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:03.061]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[01:21:12.213 --> 01:21:15.636]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:15.636 --> 01:21:21.282]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:21.282 --> 01:21:26.807]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:26.807 --> 01:21:36.456]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:36.556 --> 01:21:38.918]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:38.918 --> 01:21:40.498]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:40.498 --> 01:21:42.960]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.081]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:45.081 --> 01:21:50.245]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:50.245 --> 01:21:59.350]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:01.306 --> 01:22:11.334]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:11.334 --> 01:22:17.779]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:17.779 --> 01:22:26.626]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:26.986 --> 01:22:36.171]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:36.171 --> 01:22:40.774]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[01:22:40.774 --> 01:22:42.595]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:42.595 --> 01:22:45.096]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:22:45.376 --> 01:22:46.197]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:46.197 --> 01:22:48.198]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[01:22:48.198 --> 01:22:48.638]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.638 --> 01:22:49.199]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.199 --> 01:22:49.619]  Hello!
[01:22:49.619 --> 01:22:51.981]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[01:22:51.981 --> 01:22:54.703]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[01:23:12.995 --> 01:23:16.577]  That's all that people like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:23:16.577 --> 01:23:20.678]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[01:23:20.678 --> 01:23:24.720]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:27.521]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[01:23:27.521 --> 01:23:28.542]  It was empowering.
[01:23:28.542 --> 01:23:32.544]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[01:23:32.544 --> 01:23:35.365]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[01:23:35.365 --> 01:23:38.106]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[01:23:38.106 --> 01:23:39.206]  Thank you so much.
[01:23:39.206 --> 01:23:42.048]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[01:23:42.048 --> 01:23:42.568]  Thanks again.
[01:23:42.788 --> 01:23:46.170]  Knowledge is power, and that power brings peace.
[01:23:46.170 --> 01:23:49.592]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[01:23:49.592 --> 01:23:53.174]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[01:23:53.174 --> 01:24:07.702]  You can order online for you and your loved ones, or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[01:24:07.702 --> 01:24:09.924]  Alright, I'm gonna try to go to your calls a little bit quicker now.
[01:24:11.752 --> 01:24:17.116]  And then coming up, I want to spend more time on Interpol being given total immunity.
[01:24:17.116 --> 01:24:19.478]  Because this is more than just what it looks like on the surface.
[01:24:19.478 --> 01:24:22.721]  That's bad enough.
[01:24:22.721 --> 01:24:27.385]  You see, then our police get immunity by becoming international.
[01:24:27.385 --> 01:24:28.626]  That's the big dirty secret.
[01:24:28.626 --> 01:24:30.267]  I'm gonna break it down coming up.
[01:24:30.267 --> 01:24:31.789]  Steve in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[01:24:31.789 --> 01:24:36.212]  Go ahead.
[01:24:36.212 --> 01:24:38.054]  Hey Steve, I hear you with the telephone there.
[01:24:38.054 --> 01:24:38.534]  How you doing?
[01:24:38.534 --> 01:24:39.075]  Hey!
[01:24:39.075 --> 01:24:40.336]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:24:40.336 --> 01:24:40.536]  Good.
[01:24:41.583 --> 01:24:44.024]  I'm glad I finally got a chance to get in.
[01:24:44.024 --> 01:24:47.366]  Hey, I've got just a couple of comments.
[01:24:47.366 --> 01:24:49.007]  First I guess about Ron Paul.
[01:24:49.007 --> 01:24:55.791]  I was involved in some delegate in the state Republican convention.
[01:24:55.791 --> 01:25:03.435]  You mentioned Ron Paul and they immediately start talking about what a nutty he is and how anybody who supports him is a nut.
[01:25:04.209 --> 01:25:06.351]  And I'm sitting there going, hey, I like the guy, you know?
[01:25:06.351 --> 01:25:07.772]  But that's not working anymore.
[01:25:07.772 --> 01:25:12.735]  See, all they try to do is use peer pressure to make you feel like you're alone.
[01:25:12.735 --> 01:25:16.178]  Oh, he doesn't want the government to grow anymore and for us to become bankrupt.
[01:25:16.178 --> 01:25:17.259]  What a kook!
[01:25:17.259 --> 01:25:19.781]  He doesn't drink big goblets of cyanide.
[01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:20.962]  What a weirdo!
[01:25:20.962 --> 01:25:22.623]  He doesn't play in traffic.
[01:25:22.623 --> 01:25:24.444]  What a crazy man!
[01:25:24.444 --> 01:25:25.985]  He doesn't swim with sharks.
[01:25:25.985 --> 01:25:26.726]  What a loon!
[01:25:26.726 --> 01:25:30.449]  He doesn't cut himself and jump into a pool of piranhas.
[01:25:30.449 --> 01:25:31.269]  What a weirdo!
[01:25:32.301 --> 01:25:34.862]  He doesn't shoot himself in the head with a shotgun!
[01:25:34.862 --> 01:25:36.563]  What a nutcase!
[01:25:36.563 --> 01:25:40.265]  He doesn't love being a slave!
[01:25:40.265 --> 01:25:42.986]  But you understand they're cold-bloodedly doing that.
[01:25:42.986 --> 01:25:46.188]  They are into the manipulation, if it's higher-level party people.
[01:25:46.188 --> 01:25:47.128]  Go ahead.
[01:25:47.128 --> 01:25:48.369]  Well, it was.
[01:25:48.369 --> 01:25:52.371]  Basically, it was precinct chairs on up.
[01:25:52.371 --> 01:25:54.492]  Yeah, look, you get a lot of smart people.
[01:25:54.492 --> 01:25:57.033]  Don't decide to work for the good guys.
[01:25:57.033 --> 01:26:00.795]  Most smart people say, I'm going to go take advantage of sheep.
[01:26:02.566 --> 01:26:06.529]  And so that's why our society is burning.
[01:26:06.529 --> 01:26:06.889]  Exactly.
[01:26:06.889 --> 01:26:07.810]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:26:07.810 --> 01:26:10.131]  I did have one other question, though.
[01:26:10.131 --> 01:26:18.477]  And that is, if these guys who are being set up, you know, and these, uh, saying, hey, you work for us, uh, this is just a little dry run.
[01:26:18.477 --> 01:26:21.800]  If they keep getting burned like this, how are they going to keep finding people to do this?
[01:26:21.800 --> 01:26:25.322]  A lot of times that's why they find low-grade morons.
[01:26:25.322 --> 01:26:27.284]  That's why they find really gullible, stupid people.
[01:26:28.155 --> 01:26:32.038]  And they've got thousands of drills going on any one week.
[01:26:32.038 --> 01:26:33.859]  I mean, there's drills everywhere.
[01:26:33.859 --> 01:26:39.883]  And so all it takes is first they get these guys recruited, they take them to lots of other drills, public drills.
[01:26:39.883 --> 01:26:46.487]  And that's why a lot of times it comes out that, hey, this guy, this terrorist took part in previous drills.
[01:26:46.487 --> 01:26:49.189]  And then finally, they just set them up.
[01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:51.610]  Most people grovel to authority.
[01:26:51.610 --> 01:26:53.972]  I mean, you're some young Muslim from a rich family.
[01:26:55.307 --> 01:27:08.015]  You get recruited to spy on other people at your college, you get taken care of, you get paid to do it, and then you get led through security.
[01:27:08.015 --> 01:27:14.198]  That's why it's so important we get this story out, so that Patsy's become aware of this.
[01:27:14.198 --> 01:27:23.324]  Well, one last comment I'll make and then I'll get off, and that is that I worked for a major defense contractor for four or five years in their surveillance and intelligence group.
[01:27:24.119 --> 01:27:28.182]  And all I can say is that there's an awful lot of nepotism in there.
[01:27:28.182 --> 01:27:36.506]  I mean, it doesn't matter who you know, or what you are, or what you know, it's who you know, and whose son you are, or whose daughter you are, or, you know, whatever.
[01:27:36.506 --> 01:27:39.368]  I mean, you can get in, and they'll promote you.
[01:27:39.368 --> 01:27:45.392]  It's a private imperium for all the contractors, all the congressmen, all the bigwigs, and
[01:27:46.152 --> 01:27:55.654]  The airport scanners, the face scanning cameras, the entire grid is all the military-industrial complex eating what's left of America.
[01:27:55.654 --> 01:27:56.734]  I agree.
[01:27:56.734 --> 01:28:01.395]  I saw stuff every day that would make your neck curl that most people don't find out until a year later.
[01:28:01.395 --> 01:28:03.955]  Well, Steve, did you know I saw the numbers two days ago?
[01:28:03.955 --> 01:28:10.497]  Did you know the Defense Department's budget is now bigger than all 50 states' budgets together every year?
[01:28:10.497 --> 01:28:11.277]  I'm not surprised.
[01:28:12.361 --> 01:28:13.321]  And why stop there?
[01:28:13.321 --> 01:28:19.064]  I mean, Obama has spent more money than all presidents before him combined.
[01:28:19.064 --> 01:28:19.584]  Why not?
[01:28:19.584 --> 01:28:23.286]  I mean, the public is wanting to be abused.
[01:28:23.286 --> 01:28:25.787]  Why not abuse them?
[01:28:25.787 --> 01:28:27.428]  Well, it's only going to last so long.
[01:28:27.428 --> 01:28:29.669]  Then the house of cards has got to fall.
[01:28:30.782 --> 01:28:37.404]  I agree, but then they plan on imploding into a really hardcore police state, and that's when it really gets bad.
[01:28:37.404 --> 01:28:40.365]  I mean, folks think when it implodes everything's gonna get better?
[01:28:40.365 --> 01:28:40.985]  Oh no!
[01:28:40.985 --> 01:28:47.187]  The yuppie next door to you will rat you out, even if you haven't done anything, just to get a loaf of bread.
[01:28:48.248 --> 01:28:48.508]  No, I haven't.
[01:28:48.508 --> 01:28:51.912]  I've read excerpts from it, and I've heard a lot of stuff of what he's written, but not completely.
[01:29:11.164 --> 01:29:23.575]  Well, you know, as far as intelligence is concerned, I just saw people, you know, getting promoted who didn't deserve to be promoted only because their father had a high-ranking position in the company.
[01:29:23.575 --> 01:29:27.058]  And that is the only thing that may save us, Steve.
[01:29:27.058 --> 01:29:28.980]  Stay there, I'm going to hold you over.
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:33.964]  Is that the system is so full of lazy pieces of garbage.
[01:29:34.745 --> 01:29:42.312]  I mean, do you think some congressman's grandson who's got a high-level position in a security company, you think he's going to be working around the clock?
[01:29:42.312 --> 01:29:42.732]  No.
[01:29:42.732 --> 01:29:46.095]  He's going to be playing golf, visiting hookers, and getting drunk.
[01:29:46.095 --> 01:29:51.800]  And that's why we can beat these people, is because we're the Patriots!
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:53.201]  We're on the march.
[01:29:53.201 --> 01:29:55.723]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.723 --> 01:29:58.406]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.069 --> 01:30:05.172]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:30:05.172 --> 01:30:08.034]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:30:08.034 --> 01:30:09.315]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[01:30:09.315 --> 01:30:10.136]  It's very real.
[01:30:10.136 --> 01:30:12.377]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:30:12.377 --> 01:30:14.039]  And it's available right now to you.

[01:31:00.834 --> 01:31:05.376]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:31:05.376 --> 01:31:06.296]  Number one.
[01:31:06.296 --> 01:31:09.717]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:31:09.717 --> 01:31:10.577]  Number two.
[01:31:10.577 --> 01:31:15.459]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:31:15.459 --> 01:31:16.199]  It's true.
[01:31:16.199 --> 01:31:20.761]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:31:21.081 --> 01:31:21.902]  Number 3.
[01:31:21.902 --> 01:31:25.485]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:31:25.485 --> 01:31:29.409]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:31:29.409 --> 01:31:30.209]  Number 4.
[01:31:30.209 --> 01:31:32.952]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:31:32.952 --> 01:31:36.655]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:31:36.655 --> 01:31:37.436]  Number 5.
[01:31:37.436 --> 01:31:41.580]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:46.344]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:31:46.624 --> 01:31:50.789]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:31:50.789 --> 01:31:52.591]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:32:02.557 --> 01:32:06.520]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:15.387]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:15.387 --> 01:32:20.011]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:20.011 --> 01:32:30.840]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:40.963]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:40.963 --> 01:32:46.405]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:46.405 --> 01:32:53.888]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:53.888 --> 01:32:56.629]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:33:07.515 --> 01:33:10.400]  I know I'm just desperately ranting more and more on this show.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:12.584]  Just what do you do?
[01:33:12.584 --> 01:33:14.207]  Interpol.
[01:33:14.207 --> 01:33:15.870]  Complete diplomatic immunity.
[01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:18.795]  I mean, that is just outrageous.
[01:33:18.795 --> 01:33:19.978]  Wait until I break it down.
[01:33:20.919 --> 01:33:21.799]  Going back to Steve.
[01:33:21.799 --> 01:33:29.604]  Okay, I'm going to try to shut up for a minute or two, Steve, so you can make your point about the defense contractors and all the nepotism that goes on.
[01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:41.130]  I mean, right here in Texas, every major public utility, every public-private partnership, every one I know of is openly run by nepotism, open corruption.
[01:33:41.130 --> 01:33:44.551]  They all have their private SWAT teams beating people up.
[01:33:44.551 --> 01:33:46.933]  I mean, America is a joke, folks.
[01:33:46.933 --> 01:33:48.674]  Once you lose the Bill of Rights,
[01:33:49.841 --> 01:33:55.585]  Everything goes to hell in a handbasket and you become just like Mexico or North Korea!
[01:33:55.585 --> 01:33:59.987]  I don't understand why people can't get that!
[01:33:59.987 --> 01:34:05.891]  I just can't believe I love this country so much and I can't believe we're allowing this to happen.
[01:34:05.891 --> 01:34:08.853]  I mean, I think about the health care bill.
[01:34:08.853 --> 01:34:12.495]  I can't believe it's this bad!
[01:34:12.495 --> 01:34:13.576]  I'm gonna shut up.
[01:34:13.576 --> 01:34:14.556]  I want to go to your calls.
[01:34:14.556 --> 01:34:15.377]  Steve, finish your point.
[01:34:16.312 --> 01:34:24.196]  Well, my point was that the defense industry, when I first got into it, I thought it was going to be pretty neat.
[01:34:24.196 --> 01:34:37.002]  Unfortunately, and parts of it were, just with some of the technology that was being used, but the way it was run and the waste, I mean, I was on projects that wasted hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:34:38.519 --> 01:34:47.242]  And finally, the government would decide, well, you know, we need to just shelve that and figure out what we're going to do, and then figure out how else we're going to go spend the money.
[01:34:47.242 --> 01:34:51.804]  You know, nobody really got in trouble for all the waste.
[01:34:51.804 --> 01:34:55.846]  You know, they just thought, well, we'll just move it along and try something else.
[01:34:55.846 --> 01:35:04.809]  Well, the government is so corrupt, and again, the government's going to run the environmental policies, the Soviets would dump reactors in their own freshwater lakes.
[01:35:06.008 --> 01:35:11.290]  Have you ever Googled the maps of chemical and nuclear waste that our own government has dumped?
[01:35:11.290 --> 01:35:15.211]  It's the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic, the Pacific.
[01:35:15.211 --> 01:35:21.354]  I mean, the government doesn't have to take responsibility.
[01:35:21.354 --> 01:35:25.875]  And it gets to interface with private corporations who get to loot it.
[01:35:25.875 --> 01:35:27.516]  I mean, can't people figure that out?
[01:35:30.014 --> 01:35:31.075]  I guess not.
[01:35:31.075 --> 01:35:44.965]  You know, it was amazing to me that, you know, the company I worked for, I guess I could tell you which one it was, it doesn't really matter I guess, but, you know, they gave money to both political parties just so they'd have a foot in the door no matter which way the door swung.
[01:35:44.965 --> 01:35:49.208]  And I know a lot of places do that, but I just thought this was
[01:35:51.148 --> 01:35:52.229]  They all do it.
[01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:53.009]  They all do it.
[01:35:53.009 --> 01:36:00.876]  But when you see them double or triple or quadruple down on somebody, then you know that person's bad.
[01:36:00.876 --> 01:36:03.318]  Obama got four times the money McCain got.
[01:36:03.318 --> 01:36:07.501]  And again, I'm not saying vote for McCain or that he would have been any better.
[01:36:07.501 --> 01:36:10.884]  The point was, Obama was the heir apparent.
[01:36:10.884 --> 01:36:12.285]  He was the anointed one.
[01:36:13.206 --> 01:36:24.531]  And just in case he died in a car wreck, or slipped on a banana peel, or got caught with one of his boyfriends, just in case they had McCain as the backup.
[01:36:24.531 --> 01:36:26.172]  That's all this is!
[01:36:26.172 --> 01:36:30.134]  I appreciate your call, Steve.
[01:36:30.134 --> 01:36:41.199]  And of course, it came out in major newspapers like the Washington Post that Bill Clinton was being blackmailed by the British and the Israelis.
[01:36:41.199 --> 01:36:42.280]  And who was his chief of staff?
[01:36:44.989 --> 01:36:47.270]  Or who was the head person over his itinerary?
[01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:48.231]  Rahm Emanuel.
[01:36:48.231 --> 01:36:49.431]  Who's the chief of staff now?
[01:36:49.431 --> 01:36:50.952]  Rahm Emanuel.
[01:36:50.952 --> 01:36:53.373]  Of course Obama's blackmailed.
[01:36:53.373 --> 01:36:56.055]  That's why he was chosen.
[01:36:56.055 --> 01:37:02.378]  If you don't have 14 million skeletons in your closet, you don't get put into higher office.
[01:37:02.378 --> 01:37:08.101]  McCain had massive skeletons.
[01:37:08.101 --> 01:37:09.842]  It's a pack of criminals.
[01:37:11.576 --> 01:37:26.928]  And I know I keep saying that, it's just that I know you, the audience, understand that even better than I do, but I sit there in restaurants or grocery stores or in my front yard watching neighbors, watching people, and they're so childlike.
[01:37:26.928 --> 01:37:29.710]  They were brought up with everything so easy.
[01:37:29.710 --> 01:37:36.315]  They were brought up with everything just hand-fed to them, and they believe whatever they're told.
[01:37:36.315 --> 01:37:40.939]  I mean, if we had a population fully awake, we'd have one hell of a fight on our hands.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:49.784]  Instead, we've got a population blissfully unaware!
[01:37:49.784 --> 01:37:51.986]  Okay, back to the calls.
[01:37:51.986 --> 01:37:55.287]  Curtis in Oregon, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[01:37:55.287 --> 01:37:56.888]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:37:56.888 --> 01:38:10.336]  Spinch flipping through the TV today, the fixed corporate media, lots of fake news about the underwear terrorists down in Amsterdam, but the failing to mention about the cameraman, the guy who's shooting him,
[01:38:11.312 --> 01:38:12.233]  On the plane.
[01:38:12.233 --> 01:38:18.056]  They're saying, they're talking about his aisle and how it's a good seat for terrorism.
[01:38:18.056 --> 01:38:19.377]  But I was just commenting on that.
[01:38:19.377 --> 01:38:24.720]  My question is, if you could spend more time on this health care bill and stay away from this.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.181]  There's a clip, a friend of mine showed me this on Facebook.
[01:38:27.181 --> 01:38:35.306]  Max Baucus, the great Max Baucus, Democrat from Montana, drunk, talking about the health care bill.
[01:38:35.306 --> 01:38:36.447]  It's quite disgusting.
[01:38:36.447 --> 01:38:40.109]  If you could just read the bill, maybe, just talk about it on the air and get people to
[01:38:40.905 --> 01:38:43.887]  Thinking about it more instead of this underwear bomber?
[01:38:43.887 --> 01:38:45.447]  That'd be fantastic.
[01:38:45.447 --> 01:38:49.270]  Happy New Year to you, and Happy New Year to all the Infowarriors and Freedom Fighters out in the world.
[01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:50.770]  Peace and love, Alex Jones.
[01:38:50.770 --> 01:38:53.012]  Well, I appreciate it, Curtis.
[01:38:53.012 --> 01:39:05.678]  Yeah, people need to realize that grabbing 1 17th to 1 20th... People need to understand, correction, grabbing 17 to 20 percent, or roughly 1 5th,
[01:39:12.412 --> 01:39:15.993]  of the economy is an absolutely key objective of the bankers.
[01:39:15.993 --> 01:39:27.318]  They need a new line of credit, a new line of derivatives, a new line of your tax money that they can manipulate and use and leverage.
[01:39:27.318 --> 01:39:30.399]  And yes, we do have the clip of Baucus completely drunk.
[01:39:30.399 --> 01:39:31.779]  There's no doubt about it.
[01:39:31.779 --> 01:39:38.482]  Just up there completely drunk, slurring his words, and shaking his finger at people saying, pass the healthcare bill.
[01:39:41.198 --> 01:39:42.599]  Let's talk to Blake in Canada.
[01:39:42.599 --> 01:39:45.359]  Blake, you're on the air.
[01:39:45.359 --> 01:39:46.080]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.901]  It's an honor to be speaking with you.
[01:39:48.901 --> 01:39:54.882]  I'm a 17-year-old kid in a town of about 70,000 in Sarnia, Ontario.
[01:39:54.882 --> 01:40:05.686]  I was just wondering what is the best way for me to get all your information and your films and everything out to the mainstream public and all the kids my age and everything.
[01:40:05.686 --> 01:40:08.367]  The cheapest way to do it is to buy blank CDs.
[01:40:09.505 --> 01:40:10.866]  Not even DVDs.
[01:40:10.866 --> 01:40:14.127]  They're like 15 cents a piece if you buy enough of them.
[01:40:14.127 --> 01:40:25.311]  And to get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership and to burn DivX versions that are pretty high quality to the CDs that play on most DVD players, and to give them to everybody you know.
[01:40:25.311 --> 01:40:30.793]  You don't have access to TV that I know of in Canada, but people here in the US, they're trying to shut it down.
[01:40:30.793 --> 01:40:32.014]  Everybody should run and use that.
[01:40:33.115 --> 01:40:38.260]  You can email your friends the list of my films that are free online.
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:41.985]  Fall of the Republic, Obama Deception Endgame.
[01:40:41.985 --> 01:40:45.529]  You can call in to talk radio.
[01:40:45.529 --> 01:40:45.769]  You can...
[01:40:46.829 --> 01:40:50.933]  Go and start an organization against tyranny.
[01:40:50.933 --> 01:40:54.015]  Start getting local people to join with you.
[01:40:54.015 --> 01:40:56.277]  Pick issues you're going to deal with.
[01:40:56.277 --> 01:40:57.438]  Have hidden cameras.
[01:40:57.438 --> 01:41:03.503]  Once your group gets up to about 10, you'll have a royal amount of police show up and say, let's go blow up buildings.
[01:41:03.503 --> 01:41:09.509]  You can then videotape the Fed, put it on YouTube, and just continue to expose them.
[01:41:09.509 --> 01:41:13.692]  That happens all the time.
[01:41:13.692 --> 01:41:14.293]  I mean, really?
[01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:19.490]  Just get involved and you'll find the fight.
[01:41:19.490 --> 01:41:20.411]  Does that answer your question?
[01:41:20.411 --> 01:41:21.771]  I mean, there's so many other things you can do.
[01:41:21.771 --> 01:41:23.492]  Go to your local government.
[01:41:23.492 --> 01:41:26.793]  Speak during citizens' communications about these issues.
[01:41:26.793 --> 01:41:28.493]  It doesn't mean you have to be a perfect speaker.
[01:41:28.493 --> 01:41:30.434]  It doesn't mean you have to have all the answers.
[01:41:30.434 --> 01:41:31.815]  Just take action.
[01:41:31.815 --> 01:41:33.115]  That is the key, Blake.
[01:41:33.115 --> 01:41:34.956]  Anything else?
[01:41:34.956 --> 01:41:37.336]  No, that was just a bit of coverage there.
[01:41:37.336 --> 01:41:38.657]  Thank you so much, Blake.
[01:41:38.657 --> 01:41:39.957]  I appreciate your call.
[01:41:39.957 --> 01:41:41.418]  And I'm not trying to scare you.
[01:41:42.850 --> 01:42:03.006]  Telling you that if you get involved politically, in England, in Canada, in Australia, in the U.S., in mainline politics, I mean, going to the City Council and saying, don't take these ranchers and farmers' lands, their adverse possession, so you can build hotels on them.
[01:42:06.343 --> 01:42:08.003]  This is big money.
[01:42:08.003 --> 01:42:22.706]  And so you will have, at a restaurant, after the event, you'll be there with 10 of your friends, having barbecue or whatever, and a person will waddle over like they're with you and say, hey, how about we kill the mayor?
[01:42:22.706 --> 01:42:30.168]  And it's always an informant, it's always a cop, they have a predatory look in their eyes, a hatred for their fellow man, they enjoy evil.
[01:42:30.168 --> 01:42:32.649]  They always just look like dirtbags.
[01:42:32.649 --> 01:42:34.389]  They feel like dirtbags, their whole,
[01:42:35.623 --> 01:42:47.212]  System their whole demeanor their whole aura their vibe and you just pull a camera out on them and Say get out of here fed and they're usually so arrogant.
[01:42:47.212 --> 01:42:59.222]  They'll have an unmarked But it'll have the black white wall, you know tires they'll even have an unmarked car out in the parking lot and you just say listen criminal get out of here and
[01:43:01.220 --> 01:43:02.581]  Look, they got unlimited money.
[01:43:02.581 --> 01:43:03.422]  They're a poison.
[01:43:03.422 --> 01:43:05.424]  They're a disease poured out upon us.
[01:43:05.424 --> 01:43:07.585]  Don't you understand that?
[01:43:07.585 --> 01:43:08.446]  I've dealt with them.
[01:43:08.446 --> 01:43:09.207]  I've seen them.
[01:43:09.207 --> 01:43:10.127]  I know them.
[01:43:10.127 --> 01:43:13.791]  I know who they are.
[01:43:13.791 --> 01:43:14.871]  You control the government.
[01:43:14.871 --> 01:43:15.712]  You control everything.
[01:43:15.712 --> 01:43:17.814]  You can rob everyone, and they are.
[01:43:17.814 --> 01:43:25.681]  The health care plan funds abortion with taxpayer money.
[01:43:25.681 --> 01:43:28.223]  The health care plan puts you in jail for five years.
[01:43:31.618 --> 01:43:40.669]  Quarter million dollar fine if you don't get insurance.
[01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:46.156]  It takes 2.5 to 5% out of your paycheck, depending on your tax bracket.
[01:43:46.156 --> 01:43:48.619]  It allows the insurance companies to raise insurance prices.
[01:43:50.731 --> 01:43:55.792]  And it cuts Medicare and Medicaid by over $41 billion a year on record.
[01:43:55.792 --> 01:43:57.932]  It cuts all the freebies.
[01:43:57.932 --> 01:44:04.133]  See, we're at the end of the line now, where the taxes go up and all the goodies go bye-bye.
[01:44:04.133 --> 01:44:08.734]  And yeah, you get to go stand in line and maybe get an aspirin for your heart attack.
[01:44:08.734 --> 01:44:14.275]  Oh yeah, they got free health care in Cuba.
[01:44:14.275 --> 01:44:16.655]  If you're an inner party member, you get good health care.
[01:44:16.655 --> 01:44:19.256]  If you're just some worker from the country,
[01:44:21.089 --> 01:44:24.971]  You get some painkillers, just like our troops.
[01:44:24.971 --> 01:44:26.831]  Troops come home nerve-gassed.
[01:44:26.831 --> 01:44:31.333]  They do autopsies on thousands of dead, congressional hearings in the mid-90s.
[01:44:31.333 --> 01:44:36.995]  Their brain stems are literally dissolving from nerve gas.
[01:44:36.995 --> 01:44:37.776]  When the U.S.
[01:44:37.776 --> 01:44:43.658]  blew up the nerve gas depots at Kamasuya, and you know what they do when you're dying, shriveling up?
[01:44:44.721 --> 01:44:48.444]  They only use your patriotism when they wrap their police state in it.
[01:44:48.444 --> 01:44:54.469]  But when you're actually a Marine Corps captain dying in a wheelchair, they go, you know what you get, Mac?
[01:44:54.469 --> 01:44:57.451]  You get some painkillers, and you're lucky you get that.
[01:44:57.451 --> 01:45:02.295]  Now go die and get in a hole!
[01:45:02.295 --> 01:45:04.477]  That's how they work!
[01:45:04.477 --> 01:45:08.200]  And all of you fools that serve the system, you're gonna find out what the system thinks about you.
[01:45:08.200 --> 01:45:13.264]  Remember six months ago when Obama said they were gonna make troops pay for their own insurance?
[01:45:14.892 --> 01:45:18.355]  Pay for their own health care with their own insurance?
[01:45:18.355 --> 01:45:23.519]  Everybody got up in arms about it, so they backed off for now?
[01:45:23.519 --> 01:45:27.622]  You see, they'll get away with whatever they can.
[01:45:27.622 --> 01:45:33.807]  Who could they have cut health care and call it liberal?
[01:45:33.807 --> 01:45:34.108]  Obama.
[01:45:35.236 --> 01:45:37.499]  Who could they have launched new wars and call it liberal?
[01:45:37.499 --> 01:45:38.440]  Obama.
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:43.825]  They had gotten as much gas mileage as they could out of George W. Bush.
[01:45:43.825 --> 01:45:45.227]  And now they put in Obama.
[01:45:45.227 --> 01:45:48.370]  And his approval rating's dropping like a rock as well.
[01:45:48.370 --> 01:45:49.391]  Record low.
[01:45:49.391 --> 01:45:50.853]  His wife's a record low.
[01:45:50.853 --> 01:45:51.734]  But they don't care.
[01:45:51.734 --> 01:45:54.377]  They'll have a new right-wing puppet for you in three years.
[01:45:54.717 --> 01:46:00.099]  And then all the conservatives suddenly won't mind Interpol being in the U.S.
[01:46:00.099 --> 01:46:03.760]  They suddenly won't mind the naked body scanners in the airports.
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:10.642]  They suddenly won't mind the government health care, because they'll feel like their party won, at least.
[01:46:10.642 --> 01:46:14.544]  And they'll say, well, at least Obama isn't in there.
[01:46:14.544 --> 01:46:16.984]  Well, at least Bush isn't in there.
[01:46:16.984 --> 01:46:20.626]  It's this parlor trick.
[01:46:20.626 --> 01:46:21.506]  Oh, it makes me sick.
[01:46:23.464 --> 01:46:24.945]  Mike in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:46:24.945 --> 01:46:27.827]  Uh, Alex?
[01:46:27.827 --> 01:46:29.108]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:29.108 --> 01:46:30.710]  Oh yeah, man, this is crazy, man.
[01:46:30.710 --> 01:46:32.351]  This is funny, man.
[01:46:32.351 --> 01:46:43.079]  If the American people are dumb enough to fall for this, maybe they should, you know, maybe this is what they're, you know, maybe they're supposed to get this, because I don't know, man, this is crazy.
[01:46:43.079 --> 01:46:46.922]  I don't understand how the Americans are so dumb to fall for this.
[01:46:46.922 --> 01:46:49.164]  Well, Mike, while it's true,
[01:46:50.427 --> 01:47:03.157]  First there's the Jews, then, you know, first there's the Arabs, then there's gonna be the blacks, the Mexicans, and, you know, the whites, and all of a sudden, you know, they're gonna kill everybody.
[01:47:11.287 --> 01:47:15.091]  Well, they are poisoning everyone's water supply.
[01:47:15.091 --> 01:47:29.444]  It is on record that everyone has sterilants put in their water, and that's why... Wait till we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the last hour, I'm going to show all these news articles calling for sterilizing the population.
[01:47:29.444 --> 01:47:35.369]  People don't understand that everything is owned by these IMF bankers.
[01:47:35.369 --> 01:47:36.170]  The media,
[01:47:36.972 --> 01:47:44.780]  They damaged schools, everything is owned, even the... And it was bought through fraud!
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:58.133]  The GMO, who subsidized, how the government subsidized the farmers so they could actually make a living, Monsanto controls almost every food product that is processed.
[01:48:00.968 --> 01:48:01.828]  Absolutely.
[01:48:01.828 --> 01:48:04.109]  They want us domesticated.
[01:48:04.109 --> 01:48:05.549]  They want us dependent on them.
[01:48:05.549 --> 01:48:07.350]  That's the number one game.
[01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:10.930]  And they want us trained to literally be prisoners.
[01:48:10.930 --> 01:48:23.333]  In fact, cue out that minute and a half BBC report, the one I sent you that I titled, uh, Air Traffic Now Flying Jails.
[01:48:23.333 --> 01:48:26.234]  We're going to come back and play this after the break, but right now let's continue with calls.
[01:48:26.234 --> 01:48:27.654]  Thank you, Mike.
[01:48:27.654 --> 01:48:29.135]  Let's talk to Ed in Canada.
[01:48:29.135 --> 01:48:29.795]  Ed, you're on the air.
[01:48:29.795 --> 01:48:30.155]  Go ahead.
[01:48:31.275 --> 01:48:53.671]  Hi Alex, I'd just like to say thank you first for all the work you do, and I'm kind of nervous, but anyway, I'd just like to point out the complete ridiculousness of the bomber, and he probably drove by like two or three crowded malls on his way to the airplane with the high security and whatever else at the airport, and there's so many other soft, easier targets where he could have hurt a lot more people.
[01:48:56.397 --> 01:49:08.482]  They only do it to airports so they can have that controlled zone to jack up more security, to train you, to then move it to the off-airport sectors.
[01:49:08.482 --> 01:49:09.903]  Go ahead.
[01:49:09.903 --> 01:49:12.464]  Yeah, well, I just wanted to make that point.
[01:49:12.464 --> 01:49:13.665]  I'm silly and stupid.
[01:49:13.665 --> 01:49:14.585]  It all really is.
[01:49:14.585 --> 01:49:20.188]  There's a guy that could have made a big impact and an easier target.
[01:49:20.188 --> 01:49:23.929]  But they're so stupid, they've got to go for the high-security zone.
[01:49:23.929 --> 01:49:24.830]  That's all I'm trying to say.
[01:49:24.830 --> 01:49:25.050]  Thank you.
[01:49:25.905 --> 01:49:28.006]  I appreciate your call.
[01:49:28.006 --> 01:49:31.607]  Again, they do the drills at the high security zones.
[01:49:31.607 --> 01:49:36.008]  Do you know how many drills the Navy SEALs do of attacking their own embassies?
[01:49:36.008 --> 01:49:39.589]  Do you know how many drills the Army does of trying to get into their own bases?
[01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:45.752]  Do you know how many drills the BATF and FBI and CIA do of infiltrating airports?
[01:49:45.752 --> 01:49:47.492]  And that's what they do.
[01:49:47.492 --> 01:49:49.993]  They go hire people and tell them it's a drill.
[01:49:51.616 --> 01:49:54.297]  I mean, they've been caught doing this over and over again.
[01:49:54.297 --> 01:49:55.978]  This is not our opinion.
[01:49:55.978 --> 01:50:07.585]  And then a sharp-dressed man in a suit leads him onto the plane, past security, without a passport, he gets on, and then someone through the entire flight is videotaping him.
[01:50:07.585 --> 01:50:09.806]  Everybody was wondering, why are they videotaping that guy?
[01:50:12.748 --> 01:50:21.575]  And who knows, the Intel Center, admittedly run by the CIA, they may release a new Al-Qaeda tape saying, oh look, Al-Qaeda got off the plane, this is their victory video.
[01:50:21.575 --> 01:50:24.277]  You have no idea!
[01:50:24.277 --> 01:50:36.047]  It's like Major Hassan, for two years sending emails about how he's planning all this horrible stuff, to what he thought was Al-Qaeda, and of course it was really to Al-Cieda.
[01:50:36.047 --> 01:50:40.791]  And now Congress wants the details of those emails, and they've been told, national security, you can't have them.
[01:50:41.949 --> 01:50:47.355]  Yes, there are real lunatic Muslims that want to attack us.
[01:50:47.355 --> 01:50:50.358]  But in every case, they're shepherded and protected.
[01:50:50.358 --> 01:50:54.262]  But in this case, it looks like it's a pure patsy.
[01:50:54.262 --> 01:50:59.428]  That's the only way the pieces of a puzzle fit together.
[01:50:59.428 --> 01:51:00.269]  It's unbelievable.
[01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:04.063]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[01:51:04.063 --> 01:51:05.945]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[01:51:05.945 --> 01:51:07.807]  NoMoreMortgage can change your life.
[01:51:07.807 --> 01:51:09.248]  We paid off all of our bills.
[01:51:09.248 --> 01:51:12.030]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[01:51:12.030 --> 01:51:17.675]  With NoMoreMortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[01:51:17.675 --> 01:51:19.357]  Even have more money left over each month?
[01:51:19.357 --> 01:51:21.959]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[01:51:21.959 --> 01:51:22.419]  NoMoreMortgage.
[01:51:24.461 --> 01:51:25.742]  Where have they been all of our life?
[01:51:25.742 --> 01:51:28.243]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[01:51:28.243 --> 01:51:32.124]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[01:51:32.124 --> 01:51:34.285]  I'm Larry Ruff, President of No More Mortgage.
[01:51:34.285 --> 01:51:39.627]  This is unlike anything you have ever seen before, and it will absolutely not harm your credit.

[01:51:48.330 --> 01:51:49.591]  Call for your free CD now.
[01:51:49.591 --> 01:51:49.631]  800-578-6279.
[01:51:52.472 --> 01:51:53.272]  This works.
[01:51:53.272 --> 01:51:54.172]  Call the number.
[01:51:54.172 --> 01:51:57.313]  Call now for your free CD.
[01:51:57.313 --> 01:51:57.793]  800-578-6279.
[01:51:57.793 --> 01:51:58.473]  800-578-6279.
[01:51:58.473 --> 01:52:02.914]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.914 --> 01:52:08.495]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.495 --> 01:52:13.516]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.516 --> 01:52:13.996]  It's true.
[01:52:13.996 --> 01:52:16.817]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country.
[01:52:16.817 --> 01:52:18.557]  And it's possible that it could even happen again.
[01:52:19.097 --> 01:52:24.319]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:24.319 --> 01:52:26.619]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:26.619 --> 01:52:31.421]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:31.421 --> 01:52:32.541]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:32.541 --> 01:52:35.622]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:35.622 --> 01:52:39.243]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:39.243 --> 01:52:42.424]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:42.424 --> 01:52:44.645]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:44.645 --> 01:52:45.565]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:50.591 --> 01:52:53.455]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:53.455 --> 01:52:58.281]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:58.281 --> 01:53:00.665]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:02.102 --> 01:53:03.863]  This is an emergency alert.
[01:53:03.863 --> 01:53:06.285]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[01:53:06.285 --> 01:53:09.827]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[01:53:09.827 --> 01:53:14.610]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[01:53:14.610 --> 01:53:19.773]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[01:53:20.353 --> 01:53:24.874]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[01:53:24.874 --> 01:53:31.316]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[01:53:31.316 --> 01:53:32.957]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[01:53:32.957 --> 01:53:39.419]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[01:53:39.419 --> 01:53:41.480]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[01:53:41.480 --> 01:53:46.821]  Use Zeolife and OxySilver Hydrosol instead to detox and de-germ your body.
[01:53:46.821 --> 01:53:49.402]  Stop the shock of toxicity and preventable deaths.
[01:53:49.702 --> 01:53:52.123]  Call 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:53:52.123 --> 01:53:54.504]  That's 1-888-KO-GERMS.
[01:53:54.504 --> 01:54:02.267]  Or visit zolife.net and oxysilver.net and order your free report and package special.
[01:54:02.267 --> 01:54:17.032]  We're going to be going live at PrisonPlanet.tv, multicasting, multimedia cast of the syndicated radio transmission.
[01:54:18.988 --> 01:54:22.769]  We've got a member of the European Union Parliament coming up at the Five After.
[01:54:22.769 --> 01:54:32.092]  And then I'm gonna go over the Interpol situation and more on healthcare.
[01:54:32.092 --> 01:54:38.714]  Which, yes, this whole Flight 253 situation.
[01:54:42.199 --> 01:54:46.282]  Is serving not just as a distraction to crack down more and more security.
[01:54:46.282 --> 01:54:48.383]  There's never enough at the airports.
[01:54:48.383 --> 01:54:51.885]  But it's also being used to distract from the health care debate.
[01:54:51.885 --> 01:54:54.387]  While this is in conference committee.
[01:54:54.387 --> 01:54:58.390]  And they've had two Democrats defect in the last week to the Republicans.
[01:54:58.390 --> 01:55:00.891]  They're leaving the sinking ship.
[01:55:00.891 --> 01:55:08.897]  But once the bank robbery is in process, in progress, you know, even though they know the cops are on the way, they still
[01:55:10.219 --> 01:55:16.680]  Why abandon the armored truck full of the cash?
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:19.241]  Why abandon the armored truck full of cash?
[01:55:19.241 --> 01:55:20.961]  They're not going to.
[01:55:20.961 --> 01:55:24.482]  And so they're going to try to ram it through.
[01:55:24.482 --> 01:55:26.762]  It may fail, though.
[01:55:26.762 --> 01:55:28.463]  There is a chance.
[01:55:28.463 --> 01:55:38.625]  And a lot of this, the last two weeks of how it had to pass and couldn't be stopped, a lot of that was a foregone conclusion, where they're just putting it out there that resistance is futile, the Borg will absorb you.
[01:55:40.433 --> 01:55:46.894]  I have an AP list here of what the TSA is saying the new security will be.
[01:55:46.894 --> 01:55:48.515]  You can't cover your lap.
[01:55:48.515 --> 01:55:51.175]  You can't get up and go to the bathroom in the last hour of flight.
[01:55:51.175 --> 01:55:53.596]  You can have no electronic devices.
[01:55:53.596 --> 01:55:56.157]  You've got to go through body scanners.
[01:55:56.157 --> 01:56:06.319]  But here is the BBC announcing to all the slaves why they're being delayed to keep them safe from Al-Cieda.
[01:56:06.319 --> 01:56:06.699]  Here it is.
[01:56:07.674 --> 01:56:18.399]  Just from the UK alone, there are 100 flights to the United States, 100 from the United States, and 25,000 people traveling in either direction.
[01:56:18.399 --> 01:56:24.302]  And of course, you can multiply that by maybe tenfold for other countries flying in and out of the US.
[01:56:24.902 --> 01:56:30.766]  And all of those passengers are going to notice a very, very different attitude at security.
[01:56:30.766 --> 01:56:34.469]  First of all, the amount of hand luggage is restricted to one piece.
[01:56:34.469 --> 01:56:38.732]  And that, I understand, includes all your duty-free purchases at the airport.
[01:56:38.732 --> 01:56:45.216]  That's just because the lazies don't want to have to scan and run through all the bags.
[01:56:45.216 --> 01:56:50.580]  Again, they want to train you to be a prisoner where all your service is cut down to nothing in the name of security.
[01:56:50.580 --> 01:56:52.041]  Continue with the social engineering.
[01:56:53.395 --> 01:56:57.398]  Check-in because people will need to sort out check-in extra bags.
[01:56:57.398 --> 01:57:02.903]  The airlines have said most of them that they will not be making an additional charge for those bags, which is something.
[01:57:02.903 --> 01:57:05.024]  You then go through the norm.
[01:57:05.024 --> 01:57:10.368]  He says the regular security and they put up on screen a body scanner.
[01:57:10.368 --> 01:57:14.472]  And of course every body scanner they ever show always shows someone with a gun.
[01:57:14.472 --> 01:57:16.753]  The message is everyone's got a gun.
[01:57:16.753 --> 01:57:19.495]  See it's all psychological warfare.
[01:57:19.495 --> 01:57:19.936]  Continue.
[01:57:21.047 --> 01:57:25.050]  ...security check which passengers go to wherever their destination is.
[01:57:25.050 --> 01:57:31.253]  But, at the gate, if you're flying to or from the US, you will receive a further pat-down search.
[01:57:31.253 --> 01:57:36.157]  That is designed to, uh, identify any... Everyone gets a pat-down now!
[01:57:37.577 --> 01:57:41.138]  ...that might be strapped to the body before you are allowed on board.
[01:57:41.138 --> 01:57:52.301]  And then once you get on board, the last hour of any flight to the United States, everybody is required to be seated, nobody can use the bathrooms, and everybody is required to keep their laps uncovered.
[01:57:52.301 --> 01:57:54.922]  So you can't have blankets or laptops or anything.
[01:57:54.922 --> 01:57:57.643]  You just sit there for the last 60 minutes of the flight.
[01:57:57.643 --> 01:57:59.703]  Hit pause.
[01:57:59.703 --> 01:58:04.785]  Even in a supermax prison, you're not put into restraints when you're in your own jail cell.
[01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:15.337]  But in the Supermax prisons of the Friendly Skies, you keep your head forward, your hands out of your lap, you submit.
[01:58:15.337 --> 01:58:17.298]  And it's under Patriot Act.
[01:58:17.298 --> 01:58:20.080]  Whatever they say the regulations are, go.
[01:58:20.080 --> 01:58:21.982]  You will see people arrested for this.
[01:58:21.982 --> 01:58:25.705]  People are arrested for arguing in charge of the Patriot Act.
[01:58:25.705 --> 01:58:27.246]  And then he just goes on and on.
[01:58:27.246 --> 01:58:27.987]  I mean, come on.
[01:58:28.934 --> 01:58:30.996]  Oh my gosh, somebody might blow up an airplane.
[01:58:30.996 --> 01:58:32.598]  We all have to be slaves now.
[01:58:32.598 --> 01:58:34.140]  Someone might blow up a train.
[01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:35.661]  We have to give up all our rights there.
[01:58:35.661 --> 01:58:37.083]  Someone attacked a shopping mall.
[01:58:37.083 --> 01:58:38.264]  We've got to do it there.
[01:58:38.264 --> 01:58:39.946]  Oh my gosh, someone attacked a school.
[01:58:39.946 --> 01:58:41.808]  Everything's a prison!
[01:58:41.808 --> 01:58:47.534]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[01:58:47.534 --> 01:58:50.738]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:52.481 --> 01:58:56.485]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:58:56.485 --> 01:58:59.748]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:58:59.748 --> 01:59:04.532]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:59:04.532 --> 01:59:10.939]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:59:10.939 --> 01:59:13.181]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:59:13.681 --> 01:59:15.182]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:59:15.182 --> 01:59:16.483]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:59:16.483 --> 01:59:18.725]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:59:32.614 --> 01:59:34.735]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:59:34.735 --> 01:59:39.877]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[01:59:39.877 --> 01:59:54.284]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:59:54.284 --> 01:59:56.665]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.665 --> 01:59:59.426]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.075 --> 02:00:10.919]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.919 --> 02:00:12.500]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:14.061]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.061 --> 02:00:18.245]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.245 --> 02:00:22.288]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:27.099 --> 02:00:30.882]  Godfrey Bloom joining us coming up in the next segment.
[02:00:30.882 --> 02:00:35.345]  Member of the European Parliament for Yorkshire for the United Kingdom Independence Party.
[02:00:35.345 --> 02:00:40.868]  In the last hour I'm going to break down Interpol getting diplomatic immunity in the U.S.
[02:00:40.868 --> 02:00:49.935]  and I'm going to recap the latest developments with the vaunted shoe bomber slash underwear bomber slash syringe bomber
[02:00:51.055 --> 02:00:53.057]  And how completely staged that is.
[02:00:53.057 --> 02:01:02.404]  The good news is we exposed the fact that Bush was issuing terror alerts for political purposes and now it's been declassified and Governor Ridge wrote a book admitting it.
[02:01:02.404 --> 02:01:03.845]  They had a homeland security.
[02:01:03.845 --> 02:01:06.407]  That's pretty authoritative.
[02:01:06.407 --> 02:01:11.932]  And we're going to expose Obama and the Brits and the Germans and others for using this as a way to enslave their people.
[02:01:12.711 --> 02:01:15.313]  And we exposed the flu shots as a fraud.
[02:01:15.313 --> 02:01:23.200]  You know, they tried to order forced inoculations in New York and Boston, in Massachusetts.
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:25.922]  That failed.
[02:01:25.922 --> 02:01:27.904]  And they'll undoubtedly come back and try again.
[02:01:27.904 --> 02:01:32.287]  You know, I love the COINTELPRO that, oh, Alex said we'd have martial law.
[02:01:32.287 --> 02:01:35.089]  Alex said we'd have forced inoculations.
[02:01:35.089 --> 02:01:37.071]  Alex said we'd have this and that.
[02:01:37.071 --> 02:01:40.374]  Well, we would have had all that if you wouldn't have stood up and taken action.
[02:01:41.843 --> 02:01:48.486]  See, the establishment wants to tell you there is no New World Order, there is no threat, there is no forced inoculation.
[02:01:48.486 --> 02:01:57.971]  Even as the internal documents went out from FEMA getting people ready for it, then multiple states tried it, the people stood up and said no, they had to back off.
[02:01:57.971 --> 02:01:59.872]  We had a major victory.
[02:01:59.872 --> 02:02:06.575]  So COINTELPRO was exposed, so then they flipped their operation and say there was never a plan for forced inoculations.
[02:02:06.575 --> 02:02:07.456]  That's a lie!
[02:02:09.588 --> 02:02:16.592]  See, first there is no plan, then they admit their plan, then they come back and say, oh, there was no plan.
[02:02:16.592 --> 02:02:18.834]  We're having victories.
[02:02:18.834 --> 02:02:23.136]  And most Americans, the news has reported, have said, I don't want to go through your body scanner.
[02:02:23.136 --> 02:02:25.157]  I don't want my naked body recorded.
[02:02:25.157 --> 02:02:28.780]  And so now they're saying, oh, look, terrorists hit us.
[02:02:28.780 --> 02:02:35.204]  We've got to put everybody in a watch list, and we've got to put everybody through the scanner.
[02:02:35.204 --> 02:02:37.105]  If you don't do it, you don't fly.
[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:42.903]  Don't worry, only foreigners coming to America have to thumbprint biometrically.
[02:02:42.903 --> 02:02:45.885]  Meanwhile, every other country we fly to, we now have to do it.
[02:02:45.885 --> 02:02:47.626]  It's all under UN treaty.
[02:02:47.626 --> 02:02:56.172]  But they tell foreigners, oh don't worry, only foreigners coming to our countries, like England and Germany, only they have to thumbprint.
[02:02:56.172 --> 02:03:00.014]  But then when the Germans or the Brits, they go anywhere, they've got to thumbprint.
[02:03:00.014 --> 02:03:02.576]  Because it's already internationalized.
[02:03:02.576 --> 02:03:08.600]  And this is all rolled out psychologically to sell the public on going along with it.
[02:03:11.442 --> 02:03:17.408]  Now, our guest is coming up, then I'm going to get to Wayne, Mike, Mike, Chris, Mark, and others.
[02:03:17.408 --> 02:03:26.396]  And I'll get to you while our guest is with us, but hopefully you can address your questions to him, tailor it to them, so it won't be awkward moment.
[02:03:26.396 --> 02:03:31.741]  I do want to just take a minute out to remind all the listeners that until we get them changed in the next week or so,
[02:03:33.052 --> 02:03:44.198]  Long as you get your letter in the mail, or as long as you call, or as long as you go to the website, you can still take advantage of the new special that'll be over as soon as we change it in the next week or so.
[02:03:44.198 --> 02:03:52.082]  You can get my new film, Fall of the Republic, which shows how Obama's handing us over to international control, how he became the first U.S.
[02:03:52.082 --> 02:03:52.342]  head
[02:03:54.625 --> 02:04:02.853]  of the United Nations Security Council, violating Article 1, Section 9, the phony environmental takeover, all of it.
[02:04:02.853 --> 02:04:07.518]  Who the real enemy is covered in Fall of the Republic on DVD.
[02:04:08.615 --> 02:04:12.417]  And when you get the DVD, you can get a free t-shirt.
[02:04:12.417 --> 02:04:15.218]  The Don't Tread on Me or the Obama Joker shirt.
[02:04:15.218 --> 02:04:17.679]  There's a bunch of different variants and varieties.
[02:04:17.679 --> 02:04:21.220]  We have a bunch of other specials, free video, free t-shirt specials.
[02:04:21.220 --> 02:04:22.801]  Too many to list in the time we have.
[02:04:22.801 --> 02:04:29.124]  Go to InfoWars.com, check the Christmas specials before we remove them.
[02:04:29.124 --> 02:04:31.805]  Also, until the New Year, you can get
[02:04:33.769 --> 02:04:42.995]  Five and a half months free at PrisonPlanet.tv and we're going to simulcast the last two hours of the show coming up in the next segment at PrisonPlanet.tv for all the PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[02:04:42.995 --> 02:04:45.816]  Or you can also call toll-free to get the free t-shirt or video.
[02:04:45.816 --> 02:04:45.877]  888-253-3139.
[02:04:45.877 --> 02:04:45.957]  888-253-3139.
[02:04:45.957 --> 02:04:49.479]  Or as I said, see it all right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:04:49.479 --> 02:04:51.660]  We'll be right back with our guests.
[02:05:01.977 --> 02:05:04.978]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.978 --> 02:05:10.301]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:10.301 --> 02:05:12.361]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:12.361 --> 02:05:17.364]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:17.364 --> 02:05:18.544]  How much do you want?
[02:05:18.544 --> 02:05:19.665]  When do you want it?
[02:05:19.665 --> 02:05:21.545]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:21.545 --> 02:05:22.626]  When will you need it?
[02:05:22.626 --> 02:05:24.827]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.827 --> 02:05:26.167]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:26.167 --> 02:05:27.468]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.688 --> 02:05:32.953]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.953 --> 02:05:36.537]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:36.537 --> 02:05:40.361]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:40.361 --> 02:05:41.602]  How much will you need?
[02:05:41.602 --> 02:05:42.503]  We don't know.
[02:05:42.503 --> 02:05:43.604]  How much do you want?
[02:05:43.604 --> 02:05:44.345]  All you can get.
[02:05:44.345 --> 02:05:45.346]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:45.606 --> 02:05:48.650]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:48.650 --> 02:05:50.432]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:50.432 --> 02:05:51.353]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:00.965 --> 02:06:07.951]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[02:06:07.951 --> 02:06:09.232]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:06:09.232 --> 02:06:10.053]  It's very real.
[02:06:10.053 --> 02:06:13.936]  I know because I use one every day in my own home, and it's available right now to you.
[02:06:13.936 --> 02:06:18.260]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[02:06:48.770 --> 02:06:50.692]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:07:00.757 --> 02:07:06.063]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:07:06.063 --> 02:07:10.588]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:07:10.588 --> 02:07:12.871]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:07:12.871 --> 02:07:14.493]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:07:14.493 --> 02:07:15.534]  There is a solution.
[02:07:15.754 --> 02:07:24.179]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:08:03.092 --> 02:08:22.237]  Well, Mr President, I take the opportunity of wishing the East European cities well in the coming of the very early skiing season and snow and ice that's come there, which of course is indicative of the fact that, as independent science has now confirmed, that the globe is actually cooling and has been cooling since 2002, broadly flat since 1998.
[02:08:27.058 --> 02:08:30.002]  We're all talking about something here which isn't happening.
[02:08:30.002 --> 02:08:34.247]  I've heard time and time again members here talk of CO2 as a pollutant.
[02:08:34.247 --> 02:08:36.629]  A pollutant is a life-giving natural gas.
[02:08:36.629 --> 02:08:40.874]  It gives me the impression that some of our members haven't had the benefit of a formal education.
[02:08:41.995 --> 02:08:51.622]  Isn't this really just about the state being able to get its hand in ordinary people's trouser pocket to steal yet more tax from them?
[02:08:51.622 --> 02:08:54.564]  Isn't this all about political control?
[02:08:54.564 --> 02:08:58.367]  Isn't all this about politics and big business?
[02:08:58.367 --> 02:09:07.173]  The whole thing's a sham, this bogus hypothesis, this ridiculous nonsense that man-made CO2 is causing global warming.
[02:09:07.173 --> 02:09:11.236]  Enough, please, before we damage irrevocably the global economy.
[02:09:15.200 --> 02:09:17.222]  Okay, well that's Godfrey Bloom.
[02:09:17.222 --> 02:09:20.484]  He's an economist, military veteran.
[02:09:20.484 --> 02:09:28.511]  He is on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee for the European Union Parliament and their Environment Committee.
[02:09:28.511 --> 02:09:30.072]  And we have him for the rest of the hour.
[02:09:30.072 --> 02:09:44.224]  Very honored to have him with us on this Monday, the 28th day of December 2009, to give us a European Union view of how this unelected bureaucracy just continues to take over
[02:09:45.629 --> 02:09:56.356]  More and more of our sovereignty, and how they openly admit this is a tax to control our lives, and in the words of Maurice Strong at the UN, to destroy our industrial society.
[02:09:56.356 --> 02:10:02.720]  So to get a view on what just happened in Copenhagen, and so much more, and on what's happening with the dollar.
[02:10:03.820 --> 02:10:07.282]  The pound, the euro, what's happening with gold.
[02:10:07.282 --> 02:10:13.205]  To get a lot of different perspectives, we have Godfrey Bloom MEP, a member of European Parliament.
[02:10:13.205 --> 02:10:17.047]  His website is godfreybloommep.co.uk.
[02:10:17.047 --> 02:10:18.628]  Thank you for joining us, sir.
[02:10:18.628 --> 02:10:19.449]  Great pleasure, Alex.
[02:10:20.421 --> 02:10:21.261]  Good to have you here.
[02:10:21.261 --> 02:10:27.723]  Well, I just played a brief clip of you in the EU standing up to these people.
[02:10:27.723 --> 02:10:30.643]  What is the state of the European Union right now?
[02:10:30.643 --> 02:10:33.584]  Are they angry that their full power grab failed?
[02:10:33.584 --> 02:10:35.864]  Gordon Brown is saying he doesn't care.
[02:10:35.864 --> 02:10:45.146]  He is writing the agreement that the West will pledge money to the IMF and World Bank and UN regardless to these private bankers.
[02:10:45.146 --> 02:10:48.227]  I mean, when does this swindle end?
[02:10:49.534 --> 02:10:51.956]  Well, I'm beginning to wonder, actually.
[02:10:51.956 --> 02:11:00.984]  It's extraordinary that I find that I used to think that the United Kingdom, and to a certain extent Europe, used to follow the United States in a lot of these matters.
[02:11:00.984 --> 02:11:05.868]  And I rather fancy now that we are actually slightly ahead of you.
[02:11:05.868 --> 02:11:10.072]  And I'm watching America make some of the same mistakes that we've been making since 1945.
[02:11:12.802 --> 02:11:31.510]  We've actually handed over our country, the United Kingdom, one of the oldest democracies in the world, has now handed its entire government over to an unelected bureaucracy in Brussels without the will of the British people, without any form of referendum, and without any understanding of what we've been doing.
[02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:39.373]  And it's something that's been a conspiracy between all the major parties in the United Kingdom and all the political
[02:11:40.404 --> 02:11:42.686]  Elements in the European Union.
[02:11:42.686 --> 02:11:46.829]  Quite disgraceful, quite horrifying and unbelievable.
[02:11:46.829 --> 02:11:47.970]  Absolutely.
[02:11:47.970 --> 02:11:53.694]  Just like US politics, I've studied somewhat the British system and it's the same thing.
[02:11:53.694 --> 02:11:58.957]  Special globalist interests come in, buy off the two or three or four top parties.
[02:11:58.957 --> 02:12:04.801]  The parties may fight with each other over power, but not over carrying out their master's agenda.
[02:12:04.801 --> 02:12:08.064]  Can you break down how England has been absorbed
[02:12:08.584 --> 02:12:09.685]  Yes, it's quite extraordinary.
[02:12:09.685 --> 02:12:10.686]  In 1975, we had a referendum
[02:12:34.535 --> 02:12:37.297]  And we were told it was called something called the Common Market.
[02:12:37.297 --> 02:12:39.999]  We were told it was a free trade zone.
[02:12:39.999 --> 02:13:03.094]  And of course, being a free economist myself and a global free trader, and a relatively young man at the time in 1975, I voted for it, as a lot of people did, on the basis that we were told, quite categorically, it wouldn't affect our sovereignty as a nation, it was a free trade area, we'd bring down trade barriers and bureaucracy, and we could all trade with each other and be friends,
[02:13:03.716 --> 02:13:05.397]  And we all thought that was a good idea.
[02:13:05.397 --> 02:13:09.719]  There was no question of there being political union of any sort.
[02:13:09.719 --> 02:13:25.445]  This wasn't on the agenda, and we've seen a sort of salami slicing going on now since 1975, with one treaty after the other, which has taken us towards what we now have, which is a Soviet model.
[02:13:25.445 --> 02:13:26.726]  We have a Soviet model.
[02:13:26.726 --> 02:13:29.987]  Some people try and pretend it's the United States model, but it isn't.
[02:13:29.987 --> 02:13:31.068]  It's a Soviet model.
[02:13:31.907 --> 02:13:53.156]  Where our laws are actually made by an unelected bureaucracy and I had some of your congressmen over to Brussels who were visiting and I had the pleasure of meeting them a little while ago, just a few weeks ago, and they were absolutely astounded and horrified that the European Parliament doesn't actually make the law, it's an amending chamber.
[02:13:53.156 --> 02:13:54.957]  And so we now have 75% of our laws in England
[02:13:57.148 --> 02:14:04.831]  Made by an unelected international or European bureaucracy with absolutely no recourse to the British voters.
[02:14:04.831 --> 02:14:07.532]  There's no cost-benefit analysis.
[02:14:07.532 --> 02:14:12.153]  There's no debate that you would expect to have in our Westminster chamber.
[02:14:12.153 --> 02:14:15.554]  And people feel totally powerless in what's actually happening now.
[02:14:15.554 --> 02:14:23.497]  It's that fewer and fewer people are actually voting at elections because they know it doesn't do any good because their laws are no longer made in London.
[02:14:24.909 --> 02:14:27.110]  Which is what the bureaucrats love.
[02:14:27.110 --> 02:14:30.533]  They love people capitulating, going into a sense of apathy.
[02:14:30.533 --> 02:14:43.201]  But I have to tell you, your party, the UKIP, the UK Independence Party, is certainly rising and a lot of people are losing that apathy and finding out that this illegitimate system can be resisted.
[02:14:43.201 --> 02:14:50.266]  Now, expanding on that with European Union Member of Parliament, Godfrey Bloom, for those that don't know,
[02:14:50.746 --> 02:14:58.431]  Can you explain how this unelected bureaucracy circumvented or circumnavigated the checks and balances?
[02:14:58.431 --> 02:14:59.671]  How they do this by stealth?
[02:14:59.671 --> 02:15:04.935]  Because I've studied it, but I'm not as big an expert obviously as you are, being in the European Parliament, what, for five years.
[02:15:05.655 --> 02:15:32.326]  Because when studying your system it's very similar and has the very same people involved that are running our North American Union by stealth and we're just a few decades behind you but the process of integration is now accelerated here as it is there and so by understanding this model we can then understand how to throw it off not just in Europe and England but here in North America as well.
[02:15:32.326 --> 02:15:35.207]  It's extremely difficult actually because
[02:15:36.746 --> 02:15:38.987]  You, like us, have a two-party system.
[02:15:38.987 --> 02:15:40.709]  We have the Conservatives and Labour.
[02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:43.170]  You have Republicans and Democrats.
[02:15:43.170 --> 02:15:53.498]  It's extremely difficult if the two parties that you have, and that's the sort of democracy that's grown up over the years, you either vote for the Republicans or Democrats over there.
[02:15:53.498 --> 02:15:56.560]  We either vote for the Conservative Party or the Labour Party.
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:16:05.426]  But what we actually have is the two parties actually agree on the main fundamentals of handing over control to an international political elite.
[02:16:05.888 --> 02:16:14.872]  And what we've actually built up over the years is a political elite which is totally and utterly divorced from the will of ordinary people.
[02:16:14.872 --> 02:16:29.558]  And so when you go into, we go into the pub, you go into bars, or we go into the cricket club, you go into the baseball club, or whatever, you find that ordinary people don't want any of this, but they've been sidelined by professional politicians.
[02:16:29.558 --> 02:16:34.240]  And whereas maybe 200 years ago, certainly in Europe, there was an aristocratic class,
[02:16:34.861 --> 02:16:35.362]  I don't know.
[02:16:57.065 --> 02:17:14.441]  And let's be clear, you have a bureaucracy that sets the policies and then all the elected parliament that's represented by the different nations, all you can do is basically amend or debate smaller sections.
[02:17:14.441 --> 02:17:23.209]  So literally, the once sovereign nations of Europe and England have been turned into vestigial ceremonial offices.
[02:17:24.406 --> 02:17:28.550]  This is quite true, and of course it's totally against our constitution.
[02:17:28.550 --> 02:17:38.962]  What a lot of Americans, and I visit America quite a lot and I love to do so, they don't fully understand that we do actually have a constitution in Britain.
[02:17:38.962 --> 02:17:42.946]  We do have something called the Bill of Rights.
[02:17:43.653 --> 02:17:48.356]  Uh, which was, uh, formulated in 1688, so it's several hundred years old.
[02:17:48.356 --> 02:17:50.277]  Yeah, you have the Parliament Act, too, don't you?
[02:17:50.277 --> 02:17:52.038]  And even before that, Magna Carta.
[02:17:52.038 --> 02:17:57.682]  We do, and if you go back to 1215, of course, you go quite rightly, Alex, back to Magna Carta.
[02:17:57.682 --> 02:18:01.284]  So we've had a thousand years, nearly, of developing
[02:18:01.944 --> 02:18:06.525]  A parliamentary constitutional democracy under a constitutional monarchy.
[02:18:06.525 --> 02:18:16.527]  That, by the way, for those that don't know, was bought with a lot of blood and a lot of heroics that was then the model for our system here in the United States.
[02:18:16.527 --> 02:18:18.308]  Well, that's quite right.
[02:18:18.308 --> 02:18:29.550]  We fought to preserve a constitutional democratic monarchy in many, many wars and, of course, in the last century alongside the United States as our great ally.
[02:18:30.392 --> 02:18:39.906]  I'm a great believer in the transatlantic alliance between our two nations because we basically we think alike and we believe in the same things.
[02:18:40.342 --> 02:18:51.271]  But the problem with us is that we've discarded our Constitution and I noticed almost on a yearly basis the same thing is happening to America.
[02:18:51.271 --> 02:19:00.519]  You've discarded your Constitution and we regard, certainly thinking people over here, regard the American Constitution as one of the greatest documents ever written.
[02:19:02.239 --> 02:19:03.160]  It's amazing.
[02:19:03.160 --> 02:19:08.723]  They're getting rid of due process, secret arrest is being implemented, warrantless spying.
[02:19:08.723 --> 02:19:13.447]  All the same systems we see in Europe, England, and are being implemented in the US.
[02:19:13.447 --> 02:19:16.769]  The bureaucracies even give the programs the same names.
[02:19:16.769 --> 02:19:19.471]  This is all being internationally organized and
[02:19:20.745 --> 02:19:26.028]  Five members of our Supreme Court have said in the last two years that they will follow U.N.
[02:19:26.028 --> 02:19:33.752]  courts above our courts when this is a despotism we have in Brussels, a despotism we have in Manhattan.
[02:19:36.013 --> 02:19:36.493]  Stay with us.
[02:20:01.545 --> 02:20:03.968]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[02:20:03.968 --> 02:20:07.812]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.
[02:20:07.812 --> 02:20:11.416]  Keep listening for a special offer from PowerVapor.com.
[02:20:11.416 --> 02:20:15.420]  Standard tobacco cigarettes contain over 4,000 harmful chemicals.
[02:20:15.420 --> 02:20:20.125]  Now it's time to release yourself from the grip of big tobacco and experience true
[02:20:20.145 --> 02:20:21.505]  No smoking freedom.
[02:20:21.505 --> 02:20:30.688]  PowerVapor.com is an e-cigarette with the look, feel and smoke of a real cigarette, but with no tar, no carbon monoxide and no bad odors.
[02:20:30.688 --> 02:20:37.590]  PowerVapor's e-cigarettes deliver just the right amount of nicotine in a water vapor that looks and feels like real smoke.
[02:20:37.590 --> 02:20:40.671]  Yes, you choose from four levels of nicotine and that puts
[02:20:40.771 --> 02:20:41.331]  I think so.
[02:21:01.932 --> 02:21:09.678]  Have you heard that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, your congressional candidate, and author Robert Beatles wrote a new book called Here's What You Do.

[02:21:34.674 --> 02:21:36.754]  You know the government isn't looking out for you.
[02:21:36.754 --> 02:21:38.495]  You need to look out for yourself.
[02:21:38.495 --> 02:21:41.035]  The economy is bad, but it's probably going to get worse.
[02:21:41.035 --> 02:21:45.756]  You must prepare and make sure you are able to financially take care of yourself and your loved ones.
[02:21:45.756 --> 02:21:49.457]  Go to Here'sWhatYouDo.net and start today.
[02:21:49.457 --> 02:21:52.577]  Again, it is Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:21:52.577 --> 02:21:54.478]  That's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:21:54.478 --> 02:21:56.598]  One last time, it's Here'sWhatYouDo.net.
[02:22:01.567 --> 02:22:02.608]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:02.608 --> 02:22:07.572]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:22:07.572 --> 02:22:15.638]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:22:15.638 --> 02:22:21.222]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:22:21.222 --> 02:22:28.188]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:22:28.488 --> 02:22:34.071]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:22:34.071 --> 02:22:39.154]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:22:39.154 --> 02:22:47.098]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:22:47.098 --> 02:22:49.780]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt,
[02:22:50.240 --> 02:22:53.641]  Gold, on its own, has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:22:53.641 --> 02:22:57.502]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:57.502 --> 02:22:58.362]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[02:23:53.210 --> 02:23:54.470]  Hear the bell of the big guns.
[02:24:13.217 --> 02:24:21.925]  Godfrey Bloom, Member of the European Union and Parliament with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:24:21.925 --> 02:24:24.367]  Website is godfreybloommep.co.uk
[02:24:29.292 --> 02:24:43.776]  Sir, it does seem though that as the European Union, unelected, tries to take power, tries to abuse people, more and more countries are voting to not expand their power, though they just keep coming back with referendums till they do.
[02:24:43.776 --> 02:24:47.297]  It looks like Greece and other countries may go bankrupt under the EU.
[02:24:47.297 --> 02:24:50.598]  I mean, there's more and more talk of the EU falling apart.
[02:24:50.598 --> 02:24:52.039]  A, is that accurate?
[02:24:52.039 --> 02:24:53.379]  B, should we hope for that?
[02:24:53.379 --> 02:24:56.560]  I mean, how do we combat these people?
[02:24:57.612 --> 02:25:04.718]  Well, we've got some of the problems we have is in the differences of law that we have in the United States and the United Kingdom.
[02:25:04.718 --> 02:25:07.941]  We have three main pillars of our legal system.
[02:25:07.941 --> 02:25:13.486]  That is the presumption of innocence, trial by jury, and the concept of habeas corpus, i.e.
[02:25:13.486 --> 02:25:21.433]  the state can't lock somebody up without giving them a proper trial and a judicial system.
[02:25:21.997 --> 02:25:32.099]  Now, we've taken over, or the European Union has taken over something called the Napoleonic Code, which doesn't embody any of these things.
[02:25:32.099 --> 02:25:49.683]  And our Supreme Court, which was in fact the House of Lords, that was our final court of appeal legally, has been taken over by the European Court of Justice, which outranks that now, under a completely different system of law.
[02:25:50.428 --> 02:26:15.325]  They have a prescriptive system of law, and where these two things are extremely different, and this is something that your listeners need to understand because this is where it all begins, the system that we have in the United Kingdom, and largely the same in the United States of America, is that the legal system tells you that which you may not do.
[02:26:15.325 --> 02:26:18.708]  So there are a book of rules of things that you cannot do.
[02:26:19.204 --> 02:26:22.647]  Which we would all accept is fundamentally fair.
[02:26:22.647 --> 02:26:31.293]  Now the system of government that's come into Europe, and I think is coming into the United States, is a system which tells you that which you can do.
[02:26:31.293 --> 02:26:36.717]  A prescriptive legal system, which is extremely dangerous and extremely sinister.
[02:26:36.717 --> 02:26:40.760]  We do not want the government of the day to tell us what we can do.
[02:26:40.760 --> 02:26:43.121]  We just want a small book of rules.
[02:26:43.121 --> 02:26:43.902]  And if I may just
[02:26:44.589 --> 02:27:03.077]  Use a little analogy, which I often use here, which will help your listeners understand the point that I'm making, is that those of you with, those of your listeners with children, teenage children, probably say, as we do in England, look, there are half a dozen things you can't do in your room.
[02:27:03.077 --> 02:27:08.739]  You know, you can't smoke, you can't play loud music, no members opposite sex late at night, whatever.
[02:27:08.739 --> 02:27:11.100]  Probably half a dozen fairly sensible rules.
[02:27:11.533 --> 02:27:17.816]  But apart from that, the room belongs to, you know, the teenager and it's their space.
[02:27:17.816 --> 02:27:22.299]  And I think that's the way we've always wanted to work in our two countries.
[02:27:22.299 --> 02:27:31.664]  If you start telling them kids what they can do, you have a completely legalistic and prescriptive system, which nobody wants.
[02:27:31.664 --> 02:27:35.406]  And of course, that means you actually lose that concept of freedom.
[02:27:36.105 --> 02:27:40.149]  It's amazing, but expanding on this, was it not a grievous blow, was it a mortal blow, to have their Copenhagen treaty
[02:28:00.885 --> 02:28:06.907]  Blow up in their face, or as Gordon Brown's saying, hey, we've always been an unelected bureaucracy.
[02:28:06.907 --> 02:28:24.231]  We'll just go ahead and write up the agreement and we'll start monitoring countries, whether they like it or not, and we'll start taxing the England, the European Union, and the U.S., and we'll take that money and give it to these private banks to go out and buy off countries to go ahead and go along with it.
[02:28:24.231 --> 02:28:27.772]  I mean, they show what tyrants they are in that
[02:28:28.292 --> 02:28:33.536]  Even though the Copenhagen thing fell apart, they're still going ahead with it!
[02:28:33.536 --> 02:28:41.501]  There's nothing that the modern political class seems to take notice of, of ordinary voters.
[02:28:41.501 --> 02:28:44.783]  They don't seem to care about what ordinary people think.
[02:28:44.783 --> 02:28:52.068]  Now, for example, my party, the United Kingdom Independence Party, at the last European election on June the 4th, came second.
[02:28:52.626 --> 02:29:00.127]  Uh, over the whole country in the United Kingdom, and you know very well over there how difficult it is to start a new political party.
[02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:06.144]  It's almost impossible in a two-party system in the United Kingdom and the United States.
[02:29:06.144 --> 02:29:09.907]  But it gives you the depth of feeling there is amongst ordinary people.
[02:29:09.907 --> 02:29:11.689]  But still they ignore us.
[02:29:11.689 --> 02:29:18.254]  And of course you know that the French voted against in their referendum only two years ago.
[02:29:18.254 --> 02:29:19.475]  The French voted no.
[02:29:19.475 --> 02:29:21.076]  The Dutch voted no.
[02:29:21.076 --> 02:29:27.261]  They won't give the British a referendum on the New Lisbon Treaty, which is the final treaty, which is a self-amending treaty.
[02:29:35.765 --> 02:29:38.347]  Sir, we've got a break.
[02:29:38.347 --> 02:29:39.607]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:39.607 --> 02:29:45.170]  Continue along that thought line and how we beat these people on the other side.
[02:29:45.170 --> 02:29:52.094]  I mean, obviously we warn more people about the undemocratic nature of these people, but what else can we do?
[02:29:52.094 --> 02:29:53.495]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.495 --> 02:29:54.996]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.991 --> 02:30:01.376]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.376 --> 02:30:05.920]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.920 --> 02:30:06.840]  Number one.
[02:30:06.840 --> 02:30:10.263]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:10.263 --> 02:30:11.124]  Number two.
[02:30:11.124 --> 02:30:16.008]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:16.008 --> 02:30:16.769]  It's true.
[02:30:16.769 --> 02:30:21.313]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.613 --> 02:30:22.434]  Number 3.
[02:30:22.434 --> 02:30:26.017]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:26.017 --> 02:30:29.940]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:29.940 --> 02:30:30.741]  Number 4.
[02:30:30.741 --> 02:30:33.503]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.503 --> 02:30:37.186]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.186 --> 02:30:37.407]  Number 5.
[02:30:37.967 --> 02:30:42.110]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:47.153]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:47.153 --> 02:30:51.335]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.335 --> 02:30:53.116]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:53.116 --> 02:30:57.719]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:01.820 --> 02:31:04.822]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:04.822 --> 02:31:10.145]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:10.145 --> 02:31:12.207]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:12.207 --> 02:31:17.210]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:17.210 --> 02:31:18.390]  How much do you want?
[02:31:18.390 --> 02:31:19.511]  When do you want it?
[02:31:19.511 --> 02:31:21.392]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:21.392 --> 02:31:22.473]  When will you need it?
[02:31:22.473 --> 02:31:24.674]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:24.674 --> 02:31:26.015]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:26.015 --> 02:31:27.536]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:27.536 --> 02:31:28.597]  If there's a quarantine,
[02:31:28.737 --> 02:31:30.079]  And you can't feed yourself.
[02:31:30.079 --> 02:31:32.802]  Will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:32.802 --> 02:31:36.386]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:36.386 --> 02:31:40.210]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:40.210 --> 02:31:41.432]  How much will you need?
[02:31:41.432 --> 02:31:42.333]  We don't know.
[02:31:42.333 --> 02:31:43.434]  How much do you want?
[02:31:43.434 --> 02:31:44.375]  All you can get.
[02:31:44.375 --> 02:31:45.176]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:45.456 --> 02:31:48.498]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:31:48.498 --> 02:31:50.740]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:31:50.740 --> 02:31:51.721]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:32:00.839 --> 02:32:06.146]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:32:06.146 --> 02:32:10.672]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:32:10.672 --> 02:32:12.955]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:32:12.955 --> 02:32:14.577]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:32:14.577 --> 02:32:15.619]  There is a solution.
[02:32:15.839 --> 02:32:24.265]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[02:32:24.265 --> 02:32:31.710]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[02:32:31.710 --> 02:32:37.374]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health major.
[02:32:37.754 --> 02:32:43.779]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[02:32:43.779 --> 02:32:47.922]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[02:32:47.922 --> 02:32:55.388]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now at 866-762-9238.
[02:32:55.388 --> 02:32:58.691]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:30.040]  Just a few days ago, Chris Matthews praised Saul Alinsky, the admitted hardcore communist, called a communist communist by the American Communist League and others, who called for putting Americans in re-education camps, who dedicated his book, Rules for Radicals, to Lucifer.
[02:33:30.040 --> 02:33:31.321]  You can't make this stuff up.
[02:33:31.321 --> 02:33:34.263]  I mean, truth is so much stranger than fiction.
[02:33:34.263 --> 02:33:41.387]  Under national security, they declared Hillary's thesis, only the cover page was public,
[02:33:42.892 --> 02:33:48.157]  They declared national security on it.
[02:33:48.157 --> 02:33:56.845]  They've done the same thing with Obama's, but now Curt Nemo, webmaster for Infowars.com, just sent me this.
[02:33:56.845 --> 02:33:59.707]  And they've reportedly gotten more of the thesis.
[02:33:59.707 --> 02:34:00.828]  I was just given this during the break.
[02:34:00.828 --> 02:34:02.490]  Let's check and see how much of it's there.
[02:34:03.450 --> 02:34:05.912]  I mean, part of it's always been public.
[02:34:05.912 --> 02:34:08.294]  Dude just walked in and said the thesis was just released.
[02:34:08.294 --> 02:34:09.676]  Let's check and see if this is the whole thing.
[02:34:09.676 --> 02:34:29.594]  I mean, we know the cover sheet praises, there is only the fight, an analysis of the Alinsky model, a thesis for the scholarship requirement for a Bachelor of Arts degree under the Special Honors Program,
[02:34:30.831 --> 02:34:33.454]  Woolsey College, Wesley, Massachusetts.
[02:34:33.454 --> 02:34:35.896]  Hillary Rodham Clinton, political science.
[02:34:35.896 --> 02:34:36.917]  May 2nd, 1969.
[02:34:36.917 --> 02:34:39.800]  She probably wanted to get the paper in on May 1st.
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:41.482]  It was a bit late, though.
[02:34:41.482 --> 02:34:42.363]  Okay.
[02:34:42.363 --> 02:34:43.584]  Communist holiday.
[02:34:43.584 --> 02:34:44.985]  These people make me sick.
[02:34:44.985 --> 02:34:49.530]  But why do you see such big banks, big money for socialism and communism?
[02:34:49.530 --> 02:34:53.053]  Because they can pool the middle class's money, run our lives,
[02:34:53.914 --> 02:35:02.506]  The monopoly capitalists can shut down their competition, and then they can have a gaggle of armed thug communists running around enforcing it for them.
[02:35:02.506 --> 02:35:03.748]  Going to Economist?
[02:35:04.619 --> 02:35:05.820]  He's a former military veteran.
[02:35:05.820 --> 02:35:14.024]  He's on the Economy and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Union Parliament and the Environmental Committee as well.
[02:35:14.024 --> 02:35:15.906]  Godfrey Bloom is our guest.
[02:35:15.906 --> 02:35:19.888]  Sir, dealing with the mindset, you've been in the Parliament, what, five years?
[02:35:19.888 --> 02:35:21.729]  I have indeed.
[02:35:21.729 --> 02:35:30.014]  And so you're around these globalists, you're around these, most of them lapdogs, most of them from Eastern Europe, who openly love tyranny.
[02:35:30.014 --> 02:35:33.316]  I'm not bashing Eastern Europeans, but most of these guys are former
[02:35:34.216 --> 02:35:37.219]  Uh, I guess apparatchiks is the word or commissars.
[02:35:37.219 --> 02:35:38.340]  I've seen the list.
[02:35:38.340 --> 02:35:42.324]  Many of them were hardcore thugs, uh, for Khrushchev and people.
[02:35:42.324 --> 02:35:44.265]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up.
[02:35:44.265 --> 02:35:46.247]  And so all of that's going on.
[02:35:46.247 --> 02:35:47.368]  What is their mindset?
[02:35:47.368 --> 02:35:48.969]  What makes them tick?
[02:35:48.969 --> 02:35:50.511]  And, and what?
[02:35:51.403 --> 02:35:57.928]  How big a blow was this, what happened at Copenhagen, and what is the environmental movement really to these people?
[02:35:57.928 --> 02:36:00.750]  Because my research shows they're not useful idiots.
[02:36:00.750 --> 02:36:03.512]  They know it's a cold-blooded resource grab.
[02:36:03.512 --> 02:36:05.013]  They know it's a scam.
[02:36:05.013 --> 02:36:10.998]  I mean, we've got local commissars here in Austin I've talked to over dinner, and they say, Alex, join the team!
[02:36:10.998 --> 02:36:12.499]  We're robbing everyone!
[02:36:12.499 --> 02:36:14.521]  I mean, it's a big joke to them.
[02:36:14.521 --> 02:36:16.182]  Do you get the same thing out of these people?
[02:36:17.043 --> 02:36:18.485]  I don't in the Parliament, no.
[02:36:18.485 --> 02:36:22.088]  I'm dealing with people who are not as clever as that.
[02:36:22.088 --> 02:36:29.796]  I'm dealing with people who are fundamentally stupid, a lot of whom haven't had the benefit of what I would regard as a formal education.
[02:36:29.796 --> 02:36:38.764]  You heard in the speech that I made at the beginning, which I made to the Parliament, we're dealing with people who think that carbon dioxide is some sort of pollutant.
[02:36:39.699 --> 02:36:43.862]  I'm dealing with people who don't know the difference between carbon and carbon dioxide.
[02:36:43.862 --> 02:36:49.406]  I'm dealing with the difference between people who don't know the difference between carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide.
[02:36:49.406 --> 02:36:58.151]  I'm dealing with people who are almost incredibly stupid, and they are deliberately placed there by the main parties not to make a fuss.
[02:36:58.151 --> 02:37:05.136]  So when it comes to things like Copenhagen, you're actually dealing with members of my committee who actually believe this nonsense.
[02:37:05.512 --> 02:37:08.593]  And they believe this nonsense because they want to believe it.
[02:37:08.593 --> 02:37:18.356]  And of course, there's nobody so gullible as somebody who wants to believe something that they've been told because it actually now is a thread through every committee.
[02:37:18.356 --> 02:37:21.457]  It's this green thread that runs.
[02:37:21.457 --> 02:37:22.617]  It's a power grab.
[02:37:22.617 --> 02:37:34.681]  It means that we can grab more power all the time from the people, undermine the democratic situation, because if we don't take away these powers that people have died for under a democratic society for years,
[02:37:35.034 --> 02:37:36.455]  That the world is going to end.
[02:37:36.455 --> 02:37:38.856]  It's a wonderful line, Alex, isn't it?
[02:37:38.856 --> 02:37:42.537]  We know that we're breaking with democratic tradition.
[02:37:42.537 --> 02:37:44.879]  We know we're doing things that people don't want.
[02:37:44.879 --> 02:37:48.860]  But if we don't do this, we're doing this to save themselves.
[02:37:48.860 --> 02:37:51.882]  We're doing this to save the people, to save the planet.
[02:37:51.882 --> 02:37:53.723]  It's a superb one-liner.
[02:37:53.723 --> 02:38:03.307]  And of course, in all the state schools in the United Kingdom, this is being pushed forward under the special system that they have now in English state schools.
[02:38:04.232 --> 02:38:09.135]  Where they are told, teachers are told, what they can teach, how they can teach it.
[02:38:09.135 --> 02:38:12.557]  Most of the information in our country comes from television.
[02:38:12.557 --> 02:38:16.379]  Television, most television here is BBC.
[02:38:16.379 --> 02:38:24.363]  All the senior appointments of the BBC, the Director General, the Governor, the presenters, are all employees of Number 10 Downing Street.
[02:38:24.363 --> 02:38:26.504]  Because that's how the system works.
[02:38:26.504 --> 02:38:32.607]  So there's this absolute relentless barrage of bogus junk science.
[02:38:33.058 --> 02:38:33.338]  I think.
[02:38:55.117 --> 02:39:11.041]  Absolutely, there is a lot of hope because this is undemocratic, it is tyrannical, and in history, if people just continue to tell the truth and continue to expose a fraud, it will implode.
[02:39:11.041 --> 02:39:13.182]  Here's the problem though.
[02:39:13.182 --> 02:39:23.465]  Even though they've been exposed as scam artists, as frauds, the establishment just continues on down the same path.
[02:39:24.702 --> 02:39:28.444]  And they're so over the top in their fraud.
[02:39:28.444 --> 02:39:37.930]  Three years ago, I interviewed David Rothschild, the heir to the largest Rothschild fortune, who was then billed as savior of the planet.
[02:39:37.930 --> 02:39:45.034]  Here he is on the cover of Outside Magazine, the hero gene, how to tap into yours.
[02:39:46.300 --> 02:39:49.901]  And it actually says in here that he's like Jesus Christ.
[02:39:49.901 --> 02:39:53.842]  I guess the Rothschilds have always thought they were the Merovingian line.
[02:39:53.842 --> 02:39:58.884]  And so it says he is a savior, he is a Christ.
[02:39:58.884 --> 02:40:00.284]  I mean, this is a new religion.
[02:40:00.284 --> 02:40:02.144]  Al Gore has said they're going into religion.
[02:40:02.144 --> 02:40:03.525]  The plastic Jesus.
[02:40:04.970 --> 02:40:15.199]  And then I have Al Gore here saying he is the, this is Newsweek, the eco-prophet, and it says he's the thinking man, thinking man saving us.
[02:40:15.199 --> 02:40:21.204]  When I had Rothschild on, he said, I said, why are the ice caps on Mars melting?
[02:40:21.204 --> 02:40:24.366]  They've since started getting larger again because the sun's cooled off.
[02:40:24.366 --> 02:40:28.610]  And he said, because Mars is closer to the sun than the Earth.
[02:40:28.610 --> 02:40:30.852]  And I said, no, Mars is the next planet out.
[02:40:32.489 --> 02:40:35.315]  And I said, why are the moons on Jupiter and Saturn melting?
[02:40:35.315 --> 02:40:37.741]  And he said, well they're closer to the Sun than the Earth.
[02:40:37.741 --> 02:40:38.743]  And I said, no they're not.
[02:40:40.054 --> 02:40:47.775]  And you know, he laughed at me, not because he didn't know, but he thought my audience was like the general public, so dumb.
[02:40:47.775 --> 02:40:50.356]  I mean, Al Gore didn't invent the internet.
[02:40:50.356 --> 02:40:52.296]  Polar Bears aren't drowning.
[02:40:52.296 --> 02:40:53.997]  Their numbers are way up.
[02:40:53.997 --> 02:40:57.677]  But they know carbon isn't carbon dioxide.
[02:40:57.677 --> 02:41:04.158]  They know all this, but they just, they're so over the top that they just keep getting away with it.
[02:41:04.158 --> 02:41:06.479]  How do you counter this level?
[02:41:08.619 --> 02:41:23.822]  I think what we need to do, and we've started over here, we haven't got that far along the road yet, but my party, the United Kingdom Independence Party, was born out of ordinary people.
[02:41:23.822 --> 02:41:34.104]  The ordinary man, and we have an expression over here, the ordinary man on the Cap'n Omnibus, it's just, you know, the ordinary, you call him, I think you call him an ordinary Joe, or you call him Joe Sixpack.
[02:41:35.217 --> 02:41:37.319]  These people, you've got to have faith in them.
[02:41:37.319 --> 02:41:41.743]  I don't think they're nearly as stupid as the liberal middle-class elite think they are.
[02:41:41.743 --> 02:41:49.610]  They know they're being conned, they know they're being lied to, and they're voting for us now when we have a proportional representation system.
[02:41:49.610 --> 02:41:59.320]  When we get away from the two-party system which we have for our European elections, they feel that they can vote for us, and they do vote for us in their millions.
[02:42:00.195 --> 02:42:03.638]  And now what we need to do is, we're going to continue with this.
[02:42:03.638 --> 02:42:07.802]  We're putting 500 candidates up for the Westminster elections in May.
[02:42:07.802 --> 02:42:14.187]  That's virtually a complete ticket of UKIP people.
[02:42:14.187 --> 02:42:19.692]  So everybody in every constituency can say, just a minute, I have got an alternative.
[02:42:19.692 --> 02:42:22.314]  And I think the same thing needs to happen in America.
[02:42:23.233 --> 02:42:30.258]  Because you do lead the world, you will always lead the world for the foreseeable future, and you can turn this round.
[02:42:30.258 --> 02:42:36.882]  And I think if people could look to America, the new world if you will, by doing something like this, I think it would be fabulous.
[02:42:36.882 --> 02:42:44.007]  And if I'll be it for me to suggest what you should call that party, but I would call it the American Constitution Party.
[02:42:44.007 --> 02:42:50.992]  Because most of what's going on as I sit in America, and the same thing in the United Kingdom, is actually a breach of constitution.
[02:42:51.420 --> 02:43:09.877]  And if you could get back to your constitution, I mean just looking at the situation with Interpol, looking at climate, looking at even the new health care bill that's coming through Congress and the Senate that you're dealing with out there at the moment, that is completely alien to the American constitution.
[02:43:10.606 --> 02:43:16.834]  That says nowhere that I can see in the American Constitution that you are responsible for your neighbor's health bills.
[02:43:16.834 --> 02:43:24.605]  But even worse than that, even if your forced socialism, which is alien to our system, which creates dependency and corruption and waste,
[02:43:25.526 --> 02:43:45.814]  Obama is massively cutting Medicare and Medicaid while jacking up taxes and prison time if you don't get the insurance and if you tell your doctor you don't want a certain treatment the government throws you off the rolls and it does create government bureaucracies that decide what treatment you get.
[02:43:45.814 --> 02:43:47.254]  It does give you rationing.
[02:43:47.254 --> 02:43:48.055]  I'll never forget
[02:43:48.953 --> 02:44:06.803]  Three or four years ago, right before Gordon Brown got into power, I watched Tony Blair in the House of Commons during Prime Minister's questions on C-SPAN, and he admitted one person, one member of the Parliament got up and said, of the House of Commons, got up and said, well, my constituent had to wait 18 months for a brain tumor.
[02:44:08.424 --> 02:44:09.704]  Yes, we did what you're doing now.
[02:44:09.704 --> 02:44:10.625]  We did in 1946.
[02:44:37.975 --> 02:44:38.295]  1947.
[02:44:38.295 --> 02:44:59.195]  We got rid of a perfectly good health system, which was based on individuals and individuals' relationships with their own doctors and their own local hospitals, which were built on some part charitable status, part fee-paid status, and they brought in this terrible monolith called the National Health System.
[02:44:59.594 --> 02:44:59.794]  I think?
[02:45:21.586 --> 02:45:23.588]  It's a sacred cow over here.
[02:45:23.588 --> 02:45:30.113]  Would you believe that now we have more administrators in the system than we have hospital beds?
[02:45:30.856 --> 02:45:35.299]  This is the sort of lunacy that you get, and I've been reading through the bill.
[02:45:35.299 --> 02:45:44.966]  I'm not an expert on it, but I would beg you and I beg all your listeners, for goodness sake, write to whoever does represent you and say, for God's sake, don't vote for this.
[02:45:44.966 --> 02:45:47.208]  This will be a disaster.
[02:45:47.208 --> 02:45:54.593]  I don't quite know how it happened, but you seem to have elected a socialist president, and I don't know how that happened.
[02:45:55.831 --> 02:45:57.232]  Well, look at the VA.
[02:45:57.232 --> 02:46:00.213]  I mean, hellish health care for our veterans.
[02:46:00.213 --> 02:46:05.155]  More than half the money gets spent on administration, not on the health care.
[02:46:05.155 --> 02:46:10.457]  And reading this bill, it is just a giant boondoggle.
[02:46:10.457 --> 02:46:14.438]  It gives the insurance companies government immunity.
[02:46:14.438 --> 02:46:16.299]  It gives the hospitals immunity.
[02:46:16.299 --> 02:46:18.240]  And you talk about globalization.
[02:46:19.175 --> 02:46:20.375]  Global governance.
[02:46:20.375 --> 02:46:21.856]  All these things that are happening.
[02:46:21.856 --> 02:46:30.139]  They have to get rid of local control to the national level if the national is going to be handed over to the international.
[02:46:30.139 --> 02:46:34.020]  And we've interviewed Nigel Farage, former leader of your party, and others.
[02:46:34.660 --> 02:46:38.182]  We've interviewed Lord Monckton and others who talk about global governance.
[02:46:38.182 --> 02:46:44.104]  The new head of the European Union, as you know, Herman Van Rompuy, says this is the first year of global governance.
[02:46:44.104 --> 02:46:47.345]  They believe the Copenhagen Treaty was the first year of global governance.
[02:46:47.345 --> 02:46:50.747]  Can you speak to this pan-global Europe
[02:46:51.187 --> 02:46:56.811]  That the EU talks about the European Union model taking over the planet through treaties.
[02:46:56.811 --> 02:47:05.896]  And I remind listeners, three years ago George Bush signed a transatlantic treaty with the SPP, Security Prosperity Partnership, with the European Union.
[02:47:05.896 --> 02:47:08.918]  So this integration is far along under stealth.
[02:47:08.918 --> 02:47:11.540]  Can you speak to their master plan?
[02:47:12.689 --> 02:47:13.650]  Yes, certainly.
[02:47:13.650 --> 02:47:33.270]  All I can tell so far is that we're dealing with a sort of a European-Soviet system, and of course all we need to do then is if we then have a North American or an American system which is similar, and it's going that way, every day you get closer to that situation.
[02:47:33.647 --> 02:47:38.191]  It's only a matter of time before those two power blocks come together.
[02:47:38.191 --> 02:47:52.784]  The only thing at the moment that is stopping that going forward at an even faster rate is the fundamental hostility in the European bureaucracy and Parliament, a fundamental hostility to the United States.
[02:47:53.180 --> 02:47:58.062]  A fundamental hostility to the concept of free trade and capitalism.
[02:47:58.062 --> 02:48:00.183]  There's a fundamental hostility to this.
[02:48:00.183 --> 02:48:05.965]  So there's actually a sort of a theoretical problem that needs to be overcome.
[02:48:05.965 --> 02:48:16.889]  But as soon as that is overcome, you've got to understand that these, as I'm sure you're listening to, that senior politicians, they don't have anything to do with the NHS.
[02:48:16.889 --> 02:48:18.249]  They go into private wards.
[02:48:18.249 --> 02:48:19.910]  They're privately looked after.
[02:48:19.910 --> 02:48:22.351]  If they have a brain tumour, it's dealt with immediately.
[02:48:23.273 --> 02:48:28.617]  But senior politicians do not send their children to the same schools.
[02:48:28.617 --> 02:48:31.178]  They do not go to the same hospitals.
[02:48:31.178 --> 02:48:40.164]  Did you know, for example, I wonder if you did, that the bureaucracy in Brussels, all the civil servant bureaucracy which is enormous, don't pay tax.
[02:48:40.164 --> 02:48:40.844]  Did you know that?
[02:48:40.844 --> 02:48:42.205]  They don't pay income taxes.
[02:48:42.205 --> 02:48:43.306]  Salaries are free of tax.
[02:48:43.976 --> 02:48:51.798]  So consequently, the more they vote for centralism, statism, and high tax and high spending, they're actually out of the loop themselves.
[02:48:51.798 --> 02:48:54.979]  Now that's a key point you just made.
[02:48:54.979 --> 02:48:55.860]  That's a key point.
[02:48:55.860 --> 02:49:01.341]  Our own Congress here exempts themselves from most of their fines and fees.
[02:49:01.341 --> 02:49:07.543]  There's a law that they have to pay taxes, but 50 plus percent have been caught just not paying.
[02:49:07.543 --> 02:49:11.085]  Go back over that though, because I was not aware of that.
[02:49:12.665 --> 02:49:15.448]  I mean, I knew that that went on in a lot of communist countries.
[02:49:15.448 --> 02:49:18.270]  They are exempt from their own taxes.
[02:49:18.270 --> 02:49:28.420]  That is the greatest mark of tyranny, is when you, it's like Animal Farm, you know, four legs good, two legs better.
[02:49:28.420 --> 02:49:30.662]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[02:49:30.662 --> 02:49:33.604]  Say that again, I'm doing a double-take here.
[02:49:33.604 --> 02:49:38.389]  There's something called a sort of, there's a notional sort of
[02:49:39.005 --> 02:49:52.269]  International tax, which is put on the bureaucrats, which is very, it's only marginal, it's something like 10%, whereas everybody else in Europe, including me, incidentally as an MEP, I pay British tax.
[02:49:52.269 --> 02:49:55.630]  I pay about 45% of my income in tax.
[02:49:55.630 --> 02:50:06.053]  But the actual bureaucracy which makes the laws, so the people who actually make the law do not pay taxes as ordinary individuals.
[02:50:06.053 --> 02:50:07.593]  They pay very marginal tax.
[02:50:08.211 --> 02:50:11.895]  They also don't pay VAT, so they drive big Range Rovers.
[02:50:11.895 --> 02:50:16.179]  They buy a brand new Range Rover or Mercedes and BMW, and there's no VAT.
[02:50:16.179 --> 02:50:18.481]  Now, VAT on the continent, on the car, is 20%.
[02:50:19.699 --> 02:50:23.763]  So imagine an immediate 20% discount on your new car.
[02:50:23.763 --> 02:50:26.125]  It's just like the Soviet system.
[02:50:26.125 --> 02:50:27.927]  It's just like the Politburo.
[02:50:27.927 --> 02:50:28.647]  Unbelievable.
[02:50:28.647 --> 02:50:29.728]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:50:29.728 --> 02:50:35.053]  Everybody's standing in sausage lines, but all the communist officials have two or three villas and racehorses.
[02:50:35.053 --> 02:50:37.956]  So they are exempt.
[02:50:37.956 --> 02:50:39.837]  They are a superclass.
[02:50:40.703 --> 02:50:42.824]  Men, are you urinating more frequently?
[02:51:04.850 --> 02:51:06.693]  Do you wake up to urinate?
[02:51:06.693 --> 02:51:08.475]  Don't ignore your prostate health.
[02:51:08.475 --> 02:51:12.460]  See your doctor for checkups and call for a free bottle of Beta Prostate.

[02:51:46.797 --> 02:51:49.799]  That's 1-800-360-8306.
[02:51:49.799 --> 02:51:52.821]  This offer is for one free bottle per household.

[02:52:03.247 --> 02:52:07.250]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:52:07.250 --> 02:52:10.512]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:10.512 --> 02:52:11.933]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:52:12.620 --> 02:52:15.282]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:15.282 --> 02:52:21.688]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.688 --> 02:52:27.232]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:27.232 --> 02:52:36.880]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.980 --> 02:52:39.321]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:39.321 --> 02:52:40.921]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.921 --> 02:52:43.382]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:43.382 --> 02:52:45.503]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:45.503 --> 02:52:50.645]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:54:17.383 --> 02:54:19.744]  By the way, this is giant news.
[02:54:19.744 --> 02:54:28.290]  Hillary Clinton's Saul Alinsky thesis, which has been classified, has been released in full.
[02:54:28.290 --> 02:54:30.371]  We were reading over this some during the break.
[02:54:30.371 --> 02:54:34.273]  It is absolute communism, how she's a communist.
[02:54:34.273 --> 02:54:35.514]  Oh, God help us.
[02:54:35.514 --> 02:54:42.378]  I mean, how did we ever let this... Folks, communists killed three, four, five times, depending on which numbers you look at, more than Hitler.
[02:54:42.378 --> 02:54:44.760]  I mean, there's nothing worse than communists.
[02:54:45.916 --> 02:54:47.978]  These are just dirty thieves.
[02:54:47.978 --> 02:54:50.020]  They don't care about the poor.
[02:54:50.020 --> 02:54:51.101]  And they know it.
[02:54:51.101 --> 02:54:58.028]  Look, I was having an incredible conversation, too, with a European Union member of parliament, Godfrey Bloom.
[02:54:58.028 --> 02:55:01.032]  I didn't know that they were exempt from tax.
[02:55:01.032 --> 02:55:02.693]  During the break, I googled it.
[02:55:02.693 --> 02:55:04.295]  There was mainstream news.
[02:55:04.295 --> 02:55:08.019]  He told me that the European Union bureaucrats that
[02:55:09.352 --> 02:55:12.695]  Yeah, they don't pay any tax.
[02:55:12.695 --> 02:55:23.105]  They pay a standard basic rate of tax, which is something, a minimal amount, like 10%.
[02:55:23.105 --> 02:55:24.966]  It's a token amount.
[02:55:24.966 --> 02:55:30.171]  They don't pay any sales tax, as you call it over there, when they buy a new car, which is 20%.
[02:55:30.171 --> 02:55:34.135]  So their new Mercedes is 20% cheaper than anybody else's.
[02:55:34.982 --> 02:55:37.245]  So they're always voting for big government.
[02:55:37.245 --> 02:55:38.786]  They're voting for more tax.
[02:55:38.786 --> 02:55:40.568]  They're voting for more spending.
[02:55:40.568 --> 02:55:43.851]  And yet they don't contribute to any of this.
[02:55:43.851 --> 02:55:47.995]  Well, our founders went to war over taxation without representation.
[02:55:47.995 --> 02:55:49.836]  You already have that because they're unelected.
[02:55:49.836 --> 02:55:51.198]  But this is even worse.
[02:55:51.198 --> 02:55:54.881]  They are openly, do as I say, not as I do.
[02:55:54.881 --> 02:55:56.763]  I mean, that is tyranny.
[02:55:56.763 --> 02:55:59.646]  I mean, it doesn't get any more bona fide than that.
[02:56:00.950 --> 02:56:04.411]  It's interesting you made a point earlier, Alex, about the East Europeans.
[02:56:04.411 --> 02:56:17.397]  You know, some of the East Europeans who weren't part of the Communist regime, the ordinary working people in places like Poland and the Czech Republic, are suddenly beginning to realise what they've stepped into.
[02:56:17.397 --> 02:56:22.459]  And it was the Czech President, President Klaus, on his outgoing speech
[02:56:23.170 --> 02:56:27.331]  And the Parliament said, you know, I know all about this.
[02:56:27.331 --> 02:56:29.872]  I went to prison under the Soviet regime.
[02:56:29.872 --> 02:56:32.833]  And what we're seeing is a Soviet regime.
[02:56:32.833 --> 02:56:37.514]  The European Union is totally modelled on the Soviet system.
[02:56:37.514 --> 02:56:39.634]  It isn't modelled on the United States.
[02:56:39.634 --> 02:56:46.496]  People are being told in Western Europe that the European Union is basically, the basic pattern is the United States.
[02:56:46.496 --> 02:56:47.757]  It's nothing of the sort.
[02:56:47.757 --> 02:56:49.357]  It's the Soviet Union.
[02:56:49.357 --> 02:56:52.558]  And all these things I've been talking about today prove it, do they not?
[02:56:54.031 --> 02:57:00.232]  And for those that haven't studied this parliamentary set-up in the bureaucracy, it really is set-up like the Politburo.
[02:57:00.232 --> 02:57:03.213]  It really is set-up to do whatever it wants, whenever it wants.
[02:57:03.213 --> 02:57:04.574]  It really is dictatorial.
[02:57:04.574 --> 02:57:15.356]  And now, they're saying they have EU arrest warrants and Obama has amended the Interpol agreement to allow them to do basically whatever they want inside the United States.
[02:57:15.356 --> 02:57:19.157]  If the European arrest warrant
[02:57:20.121 --> 02:57:49.186]  Well, if somebody says, say in Austria for example, that they don't like gypsies, and that's considered to be xenophobia under the Austrian law, they can arrest you when you go home with a European arrest warrant, they don't need a magistrate's warrant, they don't need a prima facie case, there's no concept of habeas corpus, so they can arrest you, a foreigner can arrest you, he can take you to Austria, they can imprison you without charge for as long as they like.
[02:57:49.682 --> 02:57:50.063]  I don't think so.
[02:58:04.713 --> 02:58:05.373]  We're good to go.
[02:58:30.202 --> 02:58:34.846]  Well, he's an economist, he's a member of the European Union Parliament, he's Godfrey Bloom.
[02:58:34.846 --> 02:58:37.229]  Look forward to speaking to you again in the future, sir.
[02:58:37.229 --> 02:58:38.930]  Keep up the fight against tyranny.
[02:58:38.930 --> 02:58:43.474]  Great pleasure.

[02:59:54.576 --> 02:59:56.957]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.957 --> 02:59:59.639]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:09.635 --> 03:00:23.123]  They tell you that there's no world government, as mainstream media announces every day that global government will save us, and that David Rothschild, heir to the Rothschild fortune, is Jesus.
[03:00:23.123 --> 03:00:29.646]  You cannot make this level of evil up.
[03:00:29.646 --> 03:00:30.667]  Ellen is prophet,
[03:00:33.362 --> 03:00:39.823]  is Al Gore, the eco-prophet.
[03:00:39.823 --> 03:00:45.604]  Ladies and gentlemen, this has always been classified.
[03:00:45.604 --> 03:00:46.724]  I've scanned over it.
[03:00:46.724 --> 03:00:48.505]  It looks real.
[03:00:48.505 --> 03:00:52.185]  Tartan Emo's got it up on InfoWars.com.
[03:00:52.185 --> 03:00:56.686]  They'd always declared national security on this.
[03:00:56.686 --> 03:00:58.446]  How great Saul Alinsky is.
[03:00:58.446 --> 03:01:01.187]  We already had books like Tarpoli's book documenting that
[03:01:02.900 --> 03:01:05.803]  She had Alinsky.
[03:01:05.803 --> 03:01:13.630]  Hillary brought Alinsky to the Wesley in January 69 to speak at a private dinner for a dozen students.
[03:01:13.630 --> 03:01:19.115]  And it goes on to how they expressed how much they loved communism together.
[03:01:19.115 --> 03:01:25.800]  And this is actually reading Hillary Clinton's hidden thesis, MSNBC, May 9th.
[03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:28.383]  Alinsky offered Hillary a job as a community organizer.
[03:01:30.236 --> 03:01:36.778]  See, when you hear community organizing... See, this thing's been floating around because government worshippers of communism get to read it as their Bible.
[03:01:36.778 --> 03:01:40.880]  And then they tell you, oh, there's no communism!
[03:01:40.880 --> 03:01:43.241]  Oh yeah, the government takeover of healthcare?
[03:01:43.241 --> 03:01:48.023]  Obama spending more than all presidents before him combined in less than a year?
[03:01:48.023 --> 03:01:49.043]  There's no communism?
[03:01:51.786 --> 03:01:54.287]  Well, there isn't communism in the way you were taught.
[03:01:54.287 --> 03:01:56.307]  Loving people that want to share.
[03:01:56.307 --> 03:02:01.749]  Yeah, and black uniforms want to rape your wife and daughters and put you in a slave camp.
[03:02:01.749 --> 03:02:03.190]  That's all they are.
[03:02:03.190 --> 03:02:06.030]  Slave camp runners.
[03:02:06.030 --> 03:02:07.891]  We got Tarpley coming on this week, by the way, already.
[03:02:07.891 --> 03:02:10.032]  What day is he set up for?
[03:02:10.032 --> 03:02:11.332]  Thursday, one o'clock.
[03:02:11.332 --> 03:02:14.973]  Give us a year in the review, looking into trends next year.
[03:02:14.973 --> 03:02:16.834]  We got Salente tomorrow, right?
[03:02:16.834 --> 03:02:19.615]  All right, here's the deal.
[03:02:19.615 --> 03:02:20.555]  I said I'd go to Kohl's.
[03:02:22.196 --> 03:02:45.735]  and uh... we're gonna go to uh... uh... Stephen Australia hung up I wanted to talk to him first-time callers 1-800-259-9231 I'm gonna take calls in the next segment then I'm gonna play video clips and news blitz to the end of the show recap the uh... underwear bomber and all of that uh... the uh...
[03:02:46.894 --> 03:02:47.494]  The U.N.
[03:02:47.494 --> 03:02:50.536]  being given expanded diplomatic immunity in the U.S.
[03:02:50.536 --> 03:02:55.119]  through their power arm, Interpol.
[03:02:55.119 --> 03:03:00.642]  So, that is coming up today after I take some of your phone calls.
[03:03:00.642 --> 03:03:05.624]  In fact, right now, let's go to Mike in New York.
[03:03:05.624 --> 03:03:06.485]  You're on the air, Mike.
[03:03:06.485 --> 03:03:06.825]  Go ahead.
[03:03:06.825 --> 03:03:12.128]  Yeah, go ahead, buddy.
[03:03:13.246 --> 03:03:18.109]  Okay, sir, I have a question for you on what you were talking about earlier.
[03:03:18.109 --> 03:03:23.933]  Now, obviously, in the movement in the United States, we obviously have the majority of the citizens.
[03:03:23.933 --> 03:03:29.497]  But as you mentioned earlier, the elite just keep doing whatever they want.
[03:03:29.497 --> 03:03:36.102]  And I know that there's a state while amassing physical implements of force against us.
[03:03:36.102 --> 03:03:37.323]  Yes.
[03:03:37.323 --> 03:03:37.683]  Go ahead.
[03:03:37.683 --> 03:03:38.924]  Right, right, right.
[03:03:38.924 --> 03:03:41.726]  So as far as the American people are concerned,
[03:03:43.047 --> 03:03:47.510]  We are at a point of a mass strike movement, and we have been that way.
[03:03:47.510 --> 03:03:50.131]  Yes, we are in a captured country.
[03:03:50.131 --> 03:03:53.312]  We are in an occupied nation, there's no doubt.
[03:03:53.312 --> 03:03:53.933]  Right, right.
[03:03:53.933 --> 03:04:04.138]  So, Mike, what I want you to talk about a little bit is, and this is the last thing I want you to do, was just to talk about the state movement and our progress on that as you see it, sir, and that's it.
[03:04:04.138 --> 03:04:04.938]  Thank you.
[03:04:04.938 --> 03:04:05.458]  God bless you.
[03:04:05.458 --> 03:04:06.479]  I appreciate the call, Mike.
[03:04:07.512 --> 03:04:16.722]  What's happening is the media, the ADL, the Republicans, are trying to demonize the state sovereignty movement.
[03:04:16.722 --> 03:04:19.966]  And they have Rick Perry come out and say, I want Republican Texas!
[03:04:19.966 --> 03:04:21.668]  We're gonna secede!
[03:04:21.668 --> 03:04:24.111]  And later he says, oh I was just joking in a press release.
[03:04:25.000 --> 03:04:38.345]  So they're trying to make us look like we're revolutionaries that want to secede when we want the federal government that's been captured by offshore illegitimate interests to get off our backs and follow the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:04:38.345 --> 03:04:47.569]  So over 30 states are declaring sovereignty, declaring Tenth Amendment and Ninth Amendment powers, and that is one of our biggest aces in the holes.
[03:04:47.569 --> 03:04:52.531]  The problem is the bankers through the feds have already bankrupted most of the states
[03:04:53.331 --> 03:04:55.572]  to try to make them be dependent.
[03:04:55.572 --> 03:05:01.514]  We have to get to the state houses and get the word out and let them know they have the people's support resisting this.
[03:05:01.514 --> 03:05:06.076]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar powered generator.
[03:05:06.076 --> 03:05:10.398]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:05:10.398 --> 03:05:10.878]  Number two,
[03:05:11.258 --> 03:05:16.162]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:05:16.162 --> 03:05:16.902]  It's true.
[03:05:16.902 --> 03:05:21.766]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:05:21.766 --> 03:05:22.607]  Number 3.
[03:05:22.607 --> 03:05:26.189]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:05:26.189 --> 03:05:30.112]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:05:30.112 --> 03:05:30.893]  Number 4.
[03:05:30.893 --> 03:05:33.655]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:05:33.655 --> 03:05:37.338]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:05:37.338 --> 03:05:37.578]  Number 5.
[03:05:38.118 --> 03:05:42.261]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:05:42.261 --> 03:05:47.305]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:05:47.305 --> 03:05:51.488]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:51.488 --> 03:05:53.289]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:05:53.289 --> 03:05:57.873]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:06:03.203 --> 03:06:07.164]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:07.164 --> 03:06:16.027]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[03:06:16.027 --> 03:06:20.648]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[03:06:20.648 --> 03:06:31.471]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[03:06:32.111 --> 03:06:41.620]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:41.620 --> 03:06:47.065]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:06:47.065 --> 03:06:54.551]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:06:54.551 --> 03:06:57.314]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:07:02.443 --> 03:07:06.467]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:07:06.467 --> 03:07:09.711]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:07:09.711 --> 03:07:14.877]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:07:14.877 --> 03:07:20.903]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:07:20.903 --> 03:07:23.166]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:07:23.666 --> 03:07:23.986]  Tim Geithner?
[03:07:23.986 --> 03:07:24.487]  Bernanke?
[03:07:24.487 --> 03:07:25.167]  They're arsonists!
[03:07:25.167 --> 03:07:26.448]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:07:26.448 --> 03:07:28.689]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:07:42.577 --> 03:07:46.958]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington D.C.
[03:07:46.958 --> 03:07:49.859]  we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:07:49.859 --> 03:07:58.962]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:08:03.439 --> 03:08:10.061]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:10.061 --> 03:08:17.703]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:17.703 --> 03:08:21.124]  Well, the healthcare bill is going to be
[03:08:22.349 --> 03:08:27.613]  Going into conference committee, set to be passed the next few weeks.
[03:08:27.613 --> 03:08:39.501]  Also, the federal government could run out of money by January 1st, Obama's saying, if Congress doesn't pass an increase of the debt ceiling by several trillion dollars.
[03:08:39.501 --> 03:08:40.742]  A year.
[03:08:40.742 --> 03:08:48.648]  The way the media spends it is what's just due that day, a few hundred billion.
[03:08:48.648 --> 03:08:49.789]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:08:50.831 --> 03:08:58.376]  And so they're going to threaten to shut the government down if the health care isn't rammed through.
[03:08:58.376 --> 03:09:01.298]  People better contact that conference committee.
[03:09:01.298 --> 03:09:03.820]  They better call the Democratic Party leadership.
[03:09:03.820 --> 03:09:06.522]  There are Democrats exiting the sinking ship.
[03:09:06.522 --> 03:09:14.507]  But the bigger issue is when Republicans get in in a year and take control of the House or they get control of the Senate in the next
[03:09:15.694 --> 03:09:26.898]  There's some evidence though that they're afraid of a real revolution, a peaceful revolution, through the Republican Party and that's why they've put in the bill that another two-thirds majority
[03:09:46.280 --> 03:10:02.090]  Is needed in the House or a super majority, what, 60 plus percent in the Senate, 60 or more, to be able to repeal any of this.
[03:10:02.090 --> 03:10:10.715]  So they are really trying to put the screws down and make more people dependent and take over more of health care.
[03:10:12.685 --> 03:10:25.692]  I wanted to play Congressman Bacchus here, drunkenly on the floor last week, chastising people on the other side of the aisle who need to get behind the government takeover of health care.
[03:10:25.692 --> 03:10:28.033]  Here it is.
[03:10:28.033 --> 03:10:41.780]  I asked, where's the senator on that side of the aisle who's got the courage to break from their leadership, break from the partisanship on the other side of the aisle, to work together to pass health care reform?
[03:10:42.862 --> 03:10:44.143]  I asked them, where's the courage?
[03:10:44.143 --> 03:10:52.229]  Where are the senators that have got the courage on that side of the aisle to stand up and work together on a bipartisan basis to get health care reform passed?
[03:10:52.229 --> 03:10:54.071]  Where?
[03:10:54.071 --> 03:10:59.455]  We on this side reached out our hands for bipartisan agreement on health care reform.
[03:10:59.455 --> 03:11:00.636]  Probably to a fault.
[03:11:01.454 --> 03:11:02.975]  Probably to a fault.
[03:11:02.975 --> 03:11:11.658]  And I say fault because for months and months and months, this Senate anyway, the Senate had to work with other Senators on a bipartisan basis.
[03:11:11.658 --> 03:11:15.199]  I know that the current Secretary of State very much knows that.
[03:11:15.199 --> 03:11:15.839]  He watched this.
[03:11:15.839 --> 03:11:18.160]  He saw it happen in the financial aid.
[03:11:18.160 --> 03:11:23.182]  Senator Grassley and I worked very hard to get Senators on both sides of the House to work to pass health care reform.
[03:11:28.826 --> 03:11:29.927]  I don't know.
[03:11:41.785 --> 03:11:44.407]  Those senators there in the room were acting in good faith.
[03:11:44.407 --> 03:11:46.328]  You're not watching PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:11:46.328 --> 03:11:47.970]  You can't see his body language.
[03:11:47.970 --> 03:11:49.531]  I mean, he is drunk.
[03:11:49.531 --> 03:11:50.672]  Very good questions.
[03:11:50.672 --> 03:11:52.393]  Senator Enzi, for example, from Wyoming.
[03:11:52.393 --> 03:11:53.954]  Very good questions.
[03:11:53.954 --> 03:11:57.397]  Senator Snow asked very good questions.
[03:11:57.397 --> 03:11:59.899]  Senator Grassley asked very good questions.
[03:11:59.899 --> 03:12:01.340]  Very good questions, Senator Grassley.
[03:12:01.340 --> 03:12:02.101]  But you know what happened?
[03:12:02.361 --> 03:12:03.361]  You know what happened, Mr. President?
[03:12:03.361 --> 03:12:04.122]  You know what happened?
[03:12:04.122 --> 03:12:05.022]  You know what happened?
[03:12:05.022 --> 03:12:07.802]  One by one by one, they started to drift away.
[03:12:07.802 --> 03:12:10.283]  They wanted to pass health care reform.
[03:12:10.283 --> 03:12:12.704]  They wanted to act on a bipartisan basis.
[03:12:12.704 --> 03:12:14.704]  But they were pressured.
[03:12:14.704 --> 03:12:18.605]  Pressured from their political party not to do it.
[03:12:18.605 --> 03:12:19.806]  Not to do it.
[03:12:19.806 --> 03:12:21.046]  Not to do it.
[03:12:21.046 --> 03:12:22.807]  Why are they pressured not to do it?
[03:12:22.807 --> 03:12:27.928]  Unfortunately, they gave in to their pressure because their leadership wanted a political statement.
[03:12:29.347 --> 03:12:30.248]  It's hard not to watch that.
[03:12:30.248 --> 03:12:36.513]  I mean, for people that aren't watching at PrisonPlanet.tv and are just listening to the radio, you gotta go up to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:12:36.513 --> 03:12:37.354]  I got the video linked.
[03:12:52.489 --> 03:12:55.190]  He is just completely drunk off of his gourd.
[03:12:55.190 --> 03:12:59.352]  I mean, you can hear it in the audio, but when you're watching the video, he's kind of stumbling around.
[03:12:59.352 --> 03:13:10.797]  I mean, he definitely, probably has had at least 10 whiskeys there.
[03:13:10.797 --> 03:13:12.638]  He is from Montana.
[03:13:12.638 --> 03:13:17.620]  Montana has a lot of great people out there, but what are they doing having that communist as their senator?
[03:13:17.620 --> 03:13:20.621]  Get rid of him!
[03:13:20.621 --> 03:13:21.742]  I'm sick of these people!
[03:13:23.584 --> 03:13:25.405]  Alright, let's talk to Rick in Texas.
[03:13:25.405 --> 03:13:26.106]  Rick, you're on the air.
[03:13:26.106 --> 03:13:26.506]  Go ahead.
[03:13:26.506 --> 03:13:28.307]  Hello, Alex.
[03:13:28.307 --> 03:13:29.448]  Thank you for having me on.
[03:13:29.448 --> 03:13:30.708]  Hey, buddy.
[03:13:30.708 --> 03:13:35.952]  Hey, uh, see, I just heard you talking to that last caller about physical implements of force.
[03:13:35.952 --> 03:13:47.959]  See, uh, I had been trying to get through to you, and believe it or not, I had sent some emails to you, and I'm going to have to talk to somebody off the air, but I do have some information you may want to let everybody else, or make everybody else aware of.
[03:13:47.959 --> 03:13:48.660]  Well, just tell us.
[03:13:48.660 --> 03:13:49.060]  What is it?
[03:13:49.898 --> 03:13:59.882]  Well, a couple of months ago we were down on the border and we noticed a couple of buddies called me and they said that there were some helicopters at the International Airport.
[03:13:59.882 --> 03:14:05.884]  And we had Apache helicopters, RAF medevacs, and a couple of other helicopters.
[03:14:05.884 --> 03:14:13.227]  So you need to understand we can see the Mexican border from our front doorstep and we can see the International Airport.
[03:14:13.227 --> 03:14:13.827]  And we saw
[03:14:15.318 --> 03:14:23.663]  RAF helicopters, marine helicopters, and army helicopters openly and freely going into Mexico back and forth.
[03:14:23.663 --> 03:14:27.906]  Yeah, you better believe that those are probably drug shipments.
[03:14:27.906 --> 03:14:31.629]  But, I mean, I have the FEMA press release NLE-09.
[03:14:31.629 --> 03:14:38.413]  I mean, I've seen scores of news articles over the years.
[03:14:38.413 --> 03:14:41.075]  We show a bunch of them in Road to Tyranny, my film, 2002.
[03:14:43.888 --> 03:14:49.673]  Where they have openly signed deals to use foreign troops in America.
[03:14:49.673 --> 03:14:54.157]  And now they openly have the Marine Corps and Army running checkpoints all over the country.
[03:14:54.157 --> 03:14:57.880]  But they just do it incrementally to acclimate everyone.
[03:14:57.880 --> 03:14:58.961]  And well, see?
[03:14:58.961 --> 03:15:01.043]  So the Army's running checkpoints.
[03:15:01.043 --> 03:15:05.827]  So the Army was at the Kentucky Derby stopping drunks.
[03:15:05.827 --> 03:15:07.769]  Again, they're just conditioning everybody.
[03:15:07.769 --> 03:15:09.851]  What do you think the helicopters were doing down there?
[03:15:10.896 --> 03:15:15.300]  To be absolutely honest with you, none of us know, but I did approach the airport.
[03:15:15.300 --> 03:15:19.164]  I did call a couple of people up there, and they said that they were training Cessnas.
[03:15:19.164 --> 03:15:28.793]  I did call a couple of news agencies in San Antonio, and they were stopped in Brackettville by military police and turned around.
[03:15:28.793 --> 03:15:29.814]  Hold on!
[03:15:29.814 --> 03:15:32.837]  San Antonio media was turned around where?
[03:15:34.793 --> 03:15:42.036]  As far as I heard from San Antonio media, they said they were turned around about 30 miles away in Brackettville by military police from Laughlin.
[03:15:42.036 --> 03:15:54.480]  Well, all I know is that the governor, six months ago, said no to Homeland Security, Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, MPs.
[03:15:54.480 --> 03:15:56.100]  It was in the newspapers there.
[03:15:56.100 --> 03:15:57.581]  We wrote articles about it and linked to it.
[03:15:57.581 --> 03:16:00.202]  We had a state rep on for people who want to pull that up.
[03:16:01.301 --> 03:16:08.105]  And the governor said you can't do these illegal checkpoints and the military went ahead and did it!
[03:16:08.105 --> 03:16:10.146]  Went ahead and did it!
[03:16:10.146 --> 03:16:13.628]  And so, I mean, I believe almost anything anymore.
[03:16:13.628 --> 03:16:14.949]  Well, shoot some video of it.
[03:16:14.949 --> 03:16:16.730]  Get it up on YouTube.
[03:16:16.730 --> 03:16:27.776]  I've got video, I've got pictures, but know this, Alex, we've tried to send them through to your site several times, five to six different people, and we can't get it through.
[03:16:27.776 --> 03:16:29.857]  What I mean, there's a media blackout 200 miles between
[03:16:31.528 --> 03:16:32.389]  Austin and the border.
[03:16:32.389 --> 03:16:33.910]  There's really a media blackout.
[03:16:33.910 --> 03:16:35.191]  We can't get to you.
[03:16:35.191 --> 03:16:39.894]  The first time I'm speaking to you now is probably because I'm about 50 miles away from you.
[03:16:39.894 --> 03:16:44.958]  Well, you think they've got some kind of computer system that tracks anybody locally from calling this show?
[03:16:44.958 --> 03:16:47.039]  Or blocks email in the area?
[03:16:47.039 --> 03:16:49.181]  Well, listen, I'm going to put you on hold.
[03:16:49.181 --> 03:16:54.785]  I'm going to give you one of our internal emails and send it.
[03:16:54.785 --> 03:16:55.185]  Okay?
[03:16:55.185 --> 03:16:56.246]  Or I'll get your phone number.
[03:16:56.246 --> 03:16:56.706]  How's that sound?
[03:16:56.706 --> 03:16:57.507]  Because I want to see this.
[03:16:58.356 --> 03:16:59.657]  Yeah, you're going to want to talk to me.
[03:16:59.657 --> 03:17:05.540]  I know that I'm local law enforcement, but I won't say what branch, because I don't want them to, you know, zero in on me.
[03:17:05.540 --> 03:17:06.281]  Oh, really?
[03:17:06.281 --> 03:17:07.462]  Oh, okay.
[03:17:07.462 --> 03:17:11.924]  So you're some type of peace officer down there?
[03:17:11.924 --> 03:17:14.806]  You're very close.
[03:17:14.806 --> 03:17:19.309]  You're very close, and we do have federal agents working with state agencies, and we also do have U.S.
[03:17:19.309 --> 03:17:24.552]  military within the United States Border Patrol working there as well.
[03:17:24.552 --> 03:17:27.234]  And so there's British aircraft down there?
[03:17:28.548 --> 03:17:29.609]  I think so.
[03:17:48.530 --> 03:17:50.912]  Well, I'll tell you, now that makes sense.
[03:17:50.912 --> 03:18:02.821]  If you are a police officer or a sheriff's deputy, now it makes sense that, of course, if they're running a security operation, they do have programs they can put in place to block certain emails with certain keywords.
[03:18:02.821 --> 03:18:04.982]  I have read about things like that going on.
[03:18:04.982 --> 03:18:08.905]  Wow, this must be a really important operation if they're doing stuff like that.
[03:18:08.905 --> 03:18:13.629]  So, well, I mean, I've got National Level Exercise 09 right here.
[03:18:16.323 --> 03:18:31.989]  And it openly states that all these troops from foreign countries and intelligence agencies training to deal with American terrorists, but are the police in your area starting to wake up seeing these foreign assets?
[03:18:31.989 --> 03:18:42.994]  We are seeing it, and there's plenty of us that have seen it, and maybe you, well, I'll notify you of that, but as far as I know, Texas peace officers right now are being mandated to go over chemical, biological and nuclear warfare.
[03:18:43.453 --> 03:18:47.634]  And chemical, nuclear and biological threats within the larger cities.
[03:18:47.634 --> 03:19:00.877]  Now, to be absolutely honest with you, I don't believe that a street cop is capable or has the capabilities to even be any help in a situation like that.
[03:19:00.877 --> 03:19:04.758]  I mean, a patrol car is probably... Well, that's just a test to test your federalization.
[03:19:04.758 --> 03:19:06.059]  That's a federal muster.
[03:19:06.059 --> 03:19:11.580]  I mean, all the big departments we've seen, under executive order, under FEMA funding,
[03:19:15.566 --> 03:19:23.631]  Yes, sir, absolutely.
[03:19:23.631 --> 03:19:31.096]  Like I said, when you see the information that I got and how difficult it was for us to get through to you, I'm going to be absolutely honest with you, Mr. Jones.
[03:19:31.096 --> 03:19:40.903]  We actually thought that you were sending or your outfit was sending information to them because we've actually had federal agents come to us already and ask us to stop.
[03:19:40.903 --> 03:19:42.664]  And they did attack our Second Amendment also.
[03:19:43.996 --> 03:19:45.057]  What?
[03:19:45.057 --> 03:19:46.839]  Hold on, I've got to talk to you.
[03:19:46.839 --> 03:19:47.980]  Hold on, I've got to talk to you during the break.
[03:19:47.980 --> 03:19:51.624]  This is getting crazier by the minute.
[03:19:51.624 --> 03:19:53.927]  Rick from, I guess, South Texas calling us.
[03:19:53.927 --> 03:19:59.372]  I'll tell you this, we're not in Kansas anymore, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:19:59.372 --> 03:20:00.754]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[03:20:00.754 --> 03:20:01.395]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:02.895 --> 03:20:04.656]  This is an emergency alert.
[03:20:04.656 --> 03:20:07.076]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[03:20:07.076 --> 03:20:10.618]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[03:20:10.618 --> 03:20:15.399]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[03:20:15.399 --> 03:20:20.561]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[03:20:21.141 --> 03:20:25.665]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[03:20:25.665 --> 03:20:32.111]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[03:20:32.111 --> 03:20:33.752]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[03:20:33.752 --> 03:20:40.217]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[03:20:40.217 --> 03:20:41.859]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[03:20:42.119 --> 03:20:42.520]  I think so.
[03:21:03.288 --> 03:21:07.310]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:21:07.310 --> 03:21:10.552]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:21:10.552 --> 03:21:15.355]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:21:15.355 --> 03:21:21.739]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:21:21.739 --> 03:21:23.980]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:21:24.520 --> 03:21:26.002]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:21:26.002 --> 03:21:27.283]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:21:27.283 --> 03:21:29.845]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:21:29.845 --> 03:21:31.767]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:21:31.767 --> 03:21:35.310]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:21:50.684 --> 03:22:02.053]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:22:02.053 --> 03:22:05.976]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[03:22:05.976 --> 03:22:09.799]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[03:22:09.799 --> 03:22:10.640]  Midas Resources
[03:22:14.312 --> 03:22:15.112]  We're good to go.

[03:23:02.438 --> 03:23:04.200]  Say no to government vaccinations.
[03:23:04.200 --> 03:23:05.701]  Say no to toxic overload.
[03:23:05.701 --> 03:23:07.043]  Say no to chemicals.
[03:23:07.043 --> 03:23:08.984]  Say yes to liquid zeolite.
[03:23:08.984 --> 03:23:17.693]  When you have fatigue, problems concentrating, muscle weakness, headaches, digestion, memory loss, influenza, or joint pain, the solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.
[03:23:17.773 --> 03:23:23.198]  Chemical-free Liquid Zeolite helps the body heal itself so that it can become stronger to fight off viruses.
[03:23:23.198 --> 03:23:24.999]  Why risk government vaccinations?
[03:23:24.999 --> 03:23:32.486]  Liquid Zeolite detoxifies the body by safely helping remove toxins and heavy metals, boosting energy levels, and promoting a strong immune system.
[03:23:32.486 --> 03:23:36.670]  Liquid Zeolite is tasteless, odorless, and so gentle you won't even know you're taking it.
[03:23:36.670 --> 03:23:39.172]  Feel great again in as little as three days to three weeks.

[03:24:13.226 --> 03:24:17.768]  Look out your window, baby, and the scene you'd like to catch.
[03:24:17.768 --> 03:24:20.109]  Man, he's playing Dixie.
[03:24:20.109 --> 03:24:22.370]  Man, got his hand outstretched.
[03:24:22.370 --> 03:24:24.771]  Could be the viola.
[03:24:24.771 --> 03:24:27.692]  Could be the local priest.
[03:24:38.183 --> 03:24:40.524]  Okay, I'm going to get to your calls near the end of the show.
[03:24:40.524 --> 03:24:45.427]  I just ended up spending most of a segment with that one caller because it was such interesting information.
[03:24:45.427 --> 03:24:50.729]  He's trying to send us the photos right now.
[03:24:50.729 --> 03:25:05.917]  On the subject of Interpol, I have read the executive order and what this did was amend an executive order by Ronald Reagan that did not give immunity to Interpol and it gave full immunity to Interpol.
[03:25:08.226 --> 03:25:08.426]  I think?
[03:25:27.583 --> 03:25:43.911]  For at least 20 years, they've had police and military exchange programs where our police get sent over to foreign countries, their police get sent over here, and they're now setting up a system under the EU arrest warrant and other systems where they can come here and arrest U.S.
[03:25:43.911 --> 03:25:48.353]  citizens and take them to foreign countries to be tried.
[03:25:48.353 --> 03:25:52.515]  And you just heard a European Union member of parliament breaking this down in the last hour.
[03:25:54.451 --> 03:26:02.077]  Now there are a bunch of news stories on this, but the best thing to read is Threats Watch.
[03:26:02.077 --> 03:26:07.041]  That's a link at the end of the article from National Review.
[03:26:07.041 --> 03:26:11.805]  And there's another article here that's important to read.
[03:26:14.488 --> 03:26:18.411]  That is out of another publication.
[03:26:18.411 --> 03:26:23.234]  The New Media Journal.us, the fifth column.
[03:26:23.234 --> 03:26:39.303]  President Barack Obama has issued an amendment to executive order 12,425 designating the International Law Enforcement Agency, Interpol, as a public international organization thus extending diplomatic immunity to the law enforcement group.
[03:26:39.303 --> 03:26:39.844]  The amendment
[03:26:40.862 --> 03:26:41.242]  We're good.
[03:26:58.857 --> 03:26:59.417]  We're good to go.
[03:27:29.197 --> 03:27:33.558]  Those are the areas saying they were still open to search and seizure and still had to show papers.
[03:27:33.558 --> 03:27:36.239]  The text of Section 2, which applies to Interpol states,
[03:27:53.786 --> 03:28:08.878]  C. Property and assets of international organizations, whether located and by whomsoever held, shall be immune from search unless such immunity be expressly waived and for confiscation.
[03:28:08.878 --> 03:28:18.606]  The archives and international organizations shall be inviolable or inviolate.
[03:28:18.606 --> 03:28:23.130]  Now, that means just like our rights were once inviolate, inalienable.
[03:28:24.147 --> 03:28:30.593]  Now, the arguments by the White House are, hey, the UN's already got immunity.
[03:28:30.593 --> 03:28:31.975]  Yeah, let's take it from there.
[03:28:31.975 --> 03:28:38.721]  It's kind of like they say, hey, we've been thumbprinting you to get a driver's license nationwide for the last 10 years at least.
[03:28:38.721 --> 03:28:42.184]  What's wrong with us making you thumbprint to buy and sell now?
[03:28:42.184 --> 03:28:44.287]  The government's already got your fingerprints.
[03:28:45.390 --> 03:28:51.793]  Or, the government already took your baby's blood at birth in the last 37 years if you were born in a hospital.
[03:28:51.793 --> 03:28:57.096]  What's wrong with them using it for medical experiments?
[03:28:57.096 --> 03:29:00.457]  Oh, well, here is thestatesman.com.
[03:29:00.457 --> 03:29:03.519]  Texas had destroyed baby blood taken without consent.
[03:29:05.017 --> 03:29:07.178]  Because of lawsuits.
[03:29:07.178 --> 03:29:10.340]  They tried to Buffalo these people, but they went ahead and sued.
[03:29:10.340 --> 03:29:11.521]  This is criminal.
[03:29:11.521 --> 03:29:16.004]  Texas happens to hold the DNA for the entire United States.
[03:29:16.004 --> 03:29:17.925]  But this is a UN operation.
[03:29:17.925 --> 03:29:19.986]  Told you about that 14 years ago.
[03:29:19.986 --> 03:29:23.048]  Give me a close shot of that.
[03:29:23.048 --> 03:29:25.970]  The point is, people are in denial out there.
[03:29:25.970 --> 03:29:30.113]  The denial has to end.
[03:29:30.113 --> 03:29:32.194]  This stuff is going on.
[03:29:32.194 --> 03:29:33.135]  I'm gonna finish up
[03:29:34.082 --> 03:29:36.024]  With Interpol, with the UN.
[03:29:36.024 --> 03:29:38.026]  Who made these guys God?
[03:29:38.026 --> 03:29:42.370]  Who made them all above the law?
[03:29:42.370 --> 03:29:43.511]  Okay?
[03:29:43.511 --> 03:29:45.813]  Who made them king?
[03:29:45.813 --> 03:29:46.594]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:46.594 --> 03:29:47.094]  Stay with us.
[03:29:47.094 --> 03:29:52.359]  We'll talk about sovereign immunity.
[03:29:52.359 --> 03:29:53.761]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.761 --> 03:29:56.283]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.283 --> 03:29:58.986]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.438 --> 03:30:05.440]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:30:05.440 --> 03:30:10.765]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:30:10.765 --> 03:30:12.826]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:30:12.826 --> 03:30:17.830]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:17.830 --> 03:30:18.731]  How much do you want?
[03:30:18.991 --> 03:30:20.112]  When do you want it?
[03:30:20.112 --> 03:30:21.993]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:30:21.993 --> 03:30:23.074]  When will you need it?
[03:30:23.074 --> 03:30:25.275]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:30:25.275 --> 03:30:26.616]  Will there be any food?
[03:30:26.616 --> 03:30:28.137]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:28.137 --> 03:30:33.420]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:30:33.420 --> 03:30:37.003]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:37.003 --> 03:30:40.465]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:30:40.805 --> 03:30:42.046]  How much will you need?
[03:30:42.046 --> 03:30:42.946]  We don't know.
[03:30:42.946 --> 03:30:44.047]  How much do you want?
[03:30:44.047 --> 03:30:44.967]  All you can get.
[03:30:44.967 --> 03:30:46.068]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:46.068 --> 03:30:49.110]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:30:49.110 --> 03:30:50.891]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:30:50.891 --> 03:30:51.811]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:31:01.482 --> 03:31:05.584]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[03:31:05.584 --> 03:31:08.445]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:31:08.445 --> 03:31:09.725]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:31:09.725 --> 03:31:10.546]  It's very real.
[03:31:10.546 --> 03:31:12.786]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:31:12.786 --> 03:31:14.447]  And it's available right now to you.

[03:32:01.252 --> 03:32:06.558]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:32:06.558 --> 03:32:11.083]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:32:11.083 --> 03:32:13.366]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:32:13.366 --> 03:32:14.988]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:32:14.988 --> 03:32:16.029]  There is a solution.
[03:32:16.249 --> 03:32:24.676]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:33:20.618 --> 03:33:35.584]  I remember receiving video of Cooperative Nugget, 94, 95, 96, of foreign troops training to take on American citizens.
[03:33:35.584 --> 03:33:38.405]  And this was on the video.
[03:33:38.405 --> 03:33:43.147]  And then I went to urban warfare drills all over the United States.
[03:33:43.147 --> 03:33:48.769]  I had listeners send me footage all over the country of foreign troops
[03:33:51.300 --> 03:33:53.302]  Running drills to take over U.S.
[03:33:53.302 --> 03:33:53.982]  cities.
[03:33:53.982 --> 03:33:57.145]  And they would admit it was for the United States.
[03:33:57.145 --> 03:34:01.708]  They would do mock interrogations of, where did you get the weapon?
[03:34:01.708 --> 03:34:02.809]  Where did you get the helmet?
[03:34:02.809 --> 03:34:03.750]  Where are you from?
[03:34:03.750 --> 03:34:09.734]  I'm from San Francisco.
[03:34:09.734 --> 03:34:13.377]  And I shot video of this and put it in Police State 2000.
[03:34:16.440 --> 03:34:28.071]  And people thought I hired the Coronado troop ship, and they thought I hired Hovercraft, and they thought that I had some $50 million budget, and it was fake.
[03:34:28.071 --> 03:34:34.777]  Because in 1999, people knew foreign troops in America was tyranny.
[03:34:34.777 --> 03:34:41.904]  Just like back in the 90s, we'd show a government document where they planned to condition the public, to get the public ready for implantable microchips.
[03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.770]  And then?
[03:35:08.607 --> 03:35:20.590]  In 2000, 2001, I would see Washington Post articles and Toronto Star articles, and I put them in Police State 2, the takeover, and Police State 3, total enslavement, and 9-11, the road to tyranny.
[03:35:20.590 --> 03:35:31.113]  I mean, we have the actual Washington Post and actual Toronto Star headlines saying, US signs deal with Mexico and Canada to fight terror.
[03:35:31.113 --> 03:35:33.354]  Our armies are training.
[03:35:33.354 --> 03:35:36.815]  Then two years ago, members of the US Senate
[03:35:37.845 --> 03:35:45.912]  Anne House actually wrote letters to Bush asking, what's going on with the SPP?
[03:35:45.912 --> 03:35:57.321]  Deals have been signed between the Mexican and Canadian military to be involved domestically on US soil and we weren't involved in Congress?
[03:35:57.321 --> 03:36:01.224]  Remember the Mexican troops and Dutch troops being brought in for Katrina?
[03:36:01.224 --> 03:36:04.486]  In fact, people don't believe that.
[03:36:04.486 --> 03:36:06.128]  Google Mexican troops, Katrina.
[03:36:08.387 --> 03:36:09.707]  In fact, YouTube it.
[03:36:09.707 --> 03:36:12.048]  We'll show people a YouTube video.
[03:36:12.048 --> 03:36:16.870]  For the first time since 1868, Mexican troops entered the U.S.
[03:36:16.870 --> 03:36:18.911]  Giant Mexican flags flying.
[03:36:18.911 --> 03:36:23.812]  It's all about setting the precedent.
[03:36:23.812 --> 03:36:35.236]  Then you learn that the biggest Army, Navy, Marine Corps recruiting centers are in Manila, Philippines, Mexico City, Mexico, areas of Ukraine.
[03:36:35.236 --> 03:36:37.257]  Oh, Mexican troops aid Katrina efforts.
[03:36:37.257 --> 03:36:37.837]  Fox News.
[03:36:38.936 --> 03:36:40.618]  Laredo, Texas.
[03:36:40.618 --> 03:36:48.626]  A Mexican convoy began crossing in the United States on Thursday to bring aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina.
[03:36:48.626 --> 03:36:49.227]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[03:36:49.227 --> 03:36:50.128]  I knew it was a 6.
[03:36:50.128 --> 03:36:50.148]  1846.
[03:36:50.148 --> 03:36:50.989]  I said 1868.
[03:36:50.989 --> 03:36:51.710]  Or 18-something.
[03:36:51.710 --> 03:36:52.050]  The point is 1846.
[03:36:58.604 --> 03:37:03.947]  It's the convoy bound for San Antonio as the first Mexican military unit to operate on U.S.
[03:37:03.947 --> 03:37:04.687]  soil since 1846.
[03:37:04.687 --> 03:37:10.270]  See, this is all being done to acclimate you where it sounds reasonable.
[03:37:10.270 --> 03:37:24.417]  Remember, I got interviews with Army officers, Marine Corps officers, one is in road to tyranny, about how they were doing secret gun confiscation operations in Norfolk, Virginia and other places in the late 1980s.
[03:37:29.853 --> 03:37:57.516]  Now for PR purposes, you hear, oh, in Texas, and in California, and in Arizona, and in New York State, and in Florida, the National Guard, the regular Army, the Marine Corps, are gonna be helping at football games, and the Kentucky Derby, and the NFL, Super Bowl, and to stop drunk drivers, and with the Jaws of Life, Army Times reported.
[03:38:00.750 --> 03:38:10.259]  Oh, well, of course the Army's here and suddenly there's Army ads everywhere and ads everywhere thanking the troops as they cut their health care benefits.
[03:38:10.259 --> 03:38:13.942]  It's all, do what the military says or you're not pro-America.
[03:38:13.942 --> 03:38:16.004]  The military now will run your life.
[03:38:16.004 --> 03:38:18.807]  And that's so the military hears it and gets acclimated.
[03:38:18.807 --> 03:38:21.009]  It's so the population gets acclimated.
[03:38:21.009 --> 03:38:26.494]  We are being conditioned to accept this.
[03:38:26.494 --> 03:38:26.654]  Now,
[03:38:34.514 --> 03:38:40.819]  Let me just go over a few articles I've seen in the last week on this.
[03:38:40.819 --> 03:38:44.502]  It's bad enough to have foreign troops in all these countless drills.
[03:38:44.502 --> 03:38:45.603]  What, earlier this year?
[03:38:45.603 --> 03:38:46.744]  Troops from...
[03:38:48.539 --> 03:38:52.601]  Eleven Latin American countries landed in Florida?
[03:38:52.601 --> 03:38:55.142]  Type, Latin American troops landed in Florida.
[03:38:55.142 --> 03:38:56.503]  I want people to see that.
[03:38:56.503 --> 03:38:57.663]  There's video of that.
[03:38:57.663 --> 03:39:00.044]  Latin American troops landed in Florida.
[03:39:00.044 --> 03:39:02.385]  And they practiced storming the beaches.
[03:39:02.385 --> 03:39:04.606]  And again, all of this is acclamation.
[03:39:04.606 --> 03:39:09.208]  But that's not my opinion.
[03:39:09.208 --> 03:39:16.131]  In the John Warner Defense Authorization Act of 2007, read it for yourself, in the Presidential Decision Directive 51,
[03:39:17.520 --> 03:39:19.221]  That Obama's continued.
[03:39:19.221 --> 03:39:24.463]  It states that the executive branch is supreme dictator over the entire government.
[03:39:24.463 --> 03:39:33.586]  Congress is even allowed to see the full copy of it under national security, even the Homeland Security Committee.
[03:39:33.586 --> 03:39:38.568]  In there, it states it all.
[03:39:38.568 --> 03:39:39.509]  And it states that
[03:39:40.586 --> 03:39:44.108]  Homeland Security and NORTHCOM will use U.S.
[03:39:44.108 --> 03:39:49.350]  military to engage domestic threats and to police the United States.
[03:39:49.350 --> 03:39:53.052]  And the RAND Corporation came out two weeks ago.
[03:39:53.052 --> 03:39:54.673]  In fact, that's out in my stack.
[03:39:54.673 --> 03:39:56.854]  Somebody go grab me that RAND Corporation report.
[03:39:56.854 --> 03:39:58.815]  It's 200 pages, roughly.
[03:39:58.815 --> 03:40:01.036]  It's out there in the stack on the table.
[03:40:01.036 --> 03:40:02.657]  I'll just show that to you.
[03:40:02.657 --> 03:40:03.297]  And it says
[03:40:05.071 --> 03:40:26.462]  How the Pentagon is already setting up and running, and they propose it go fully operational, total federalization of all local police, where the military supports them and they support the military, and domestic centers set up with a new Pentagon-run National Police Force.
[03:40:26.462 --> 03:40:29.624]  And again, this is all rolled out slowly.
[03:40:29.624 --> 03:40:31.105]  It's all rolled out incrementally.
[03:40:37.543 --> 03:40:51.676]  Now this is a National Review article, and when you read the Threat Watch, that has the real breakdown, really a scholarly report where it says Steve Shepard has more at Threat Watch.
[03:40:51.676 --> 03:40:56.440]  Why does Interpol need immunity from American law?
[03:40:56.440 --> 03:40:57.641]  Written by Andy McCarthy.
[03:41:02.625 --> 03:41:05.726]  You just can't make up how bizarre this crowd is.
[03:41:05.726 --> 03:41:13.788]  One week ago, President Obama quietly signed an executive order that makes international police force immune from the restraints of American law.
[03:41:13.788 --> 03:41:19.570]  Interpol is the shorthand for the International Criminal Police Organization.
[03:41:19.570 --> 03:41:23.131]  It was established in 23, but really got powerful after World War II.
[03:41:23.131 --> 03:41:26.152]  It operates in 188 countries.
[03:41:26.152 --> 03:41:27.012]  It's the real mafia.
[03:41:29.434 --> 03:41:44.760]  By Executive Order 12,425, issued in 1983, President Reagan recognized Interpol's international organization and gave it some of the privileges and immunities customarily extended to foreign diplomats.
[03:41:44.760 --> 03:41:56.685]  Interpol, however, is also an active law enforcement agency, so critical privileges and immunities set forth in Section 2C of the International Organizations Immunities Act were withheld.
[03:41:58.257 --> 03:42:00.218]  That's the section we read earlier.
[03:42:00.218 --> 03:42:04.960]  Specifically, Interpol's property and assets remain subject to search and seizure.
[03:42:04.960 --> 03:42:06.900]  They don't have diplomatic immunity.
[03:42:06.900 --> 03:42:25.308]  And its archive records remain subject to public scrutiny under provisions like the Freedom of Information Act, being constrained by the Fourth Amendment, the FOIA, and other limitations of the Constitution and federal law that protect the liberty and privacy of Americans in what
[03:42:26.628 --> 03:42:43.760]  Well, you little globalist over at the CIA-founded National Review should have thought about that before you helped sell America out, huh?
[03:42:43.760 --> 03:42:49.804]  On Wednesday, however, for no apparent reason, President Obama issued an executive order removing the Reagan limitations.
[03:42:49.804 --> 03:42:55.048]  This is Interpol's property, and assets are no longer subject to search and confiscation.
[03:42:55.888 --> 03:43:00.616]  And it's archives are now considered inviolable.
[03:43:00.616 --> 03:43:01.337]  Inviolable.
[03:43:01.337 --> 03:43:07.827]  I'm having trouble pronouncing that word, but that means basically the right of kings.
[03:43:10.783 --> 03:43:14.326]  Give me the definition of inviolable.
[03:43:14.326 --> 03:43:17.889]  I-N-V-I-O-L-I-A-B-L-E.
[03:43:17.889 --> 03:43:27.096]  I mean, I know it means that they're sovereign, standing apart, cannot be violated, cannot have liens placed on it, cannot be abridged, but I want to check that.
[03:43:27.096 --> 03:43:30.159]  So, I-N-V-I-O-L-A-B-L-E.
[03:43:30.159 --> 03:43:31.460]  That's what the executive order says.
[03:43:32.398 --> 03:43:34.180]  The International Police Force, whose U.S.
[03:43:34.180 --> 03:43:38.165]  headquarters is the Justice Department in Washington, will be unrestrained by U.S.
[03:43:38.165 --> 03:43:44.912]  Constitution and American law while it operates in the United States and affects both Americans and American interests outside the United States.
[03:43:44.912 --> 03:43:46.474]  And that's the key.
[03:43:46.474 --> 03:43:52.761]  This is not just about foreign troops, foreign police getting to come over here, this is about
[03:43:53.824 --> 03:44:09.797]  Our FBI, our federal police, our federal marshals, fully operating under UN authority, international authority, and having immunity that's been extended to this guild.
[03:44:09.797 --> 03:44:11.458]  This inviolable
[03:44:13.672 --> 03:44:21.838]  Interpol works closely with international tribunals such as the International Criminal Court, which the United States has refused to join because of its sovereignty surrendering provisions.
[03:44:21.838 --> 03:44:26.442]  And remember what the Supreme Court has said, five of the nine members have said recently.
[03:44:26.442 --> 03:44:34.368]  They've said, we will follow the orders of the UN.
[03:44:34.368 --> 03:44:40.012]  Listen to this, Marines and multinational forces train in Florida.
[03:44:40.012 --> 03:44:41.173]  Go ahead and play a clip of that.
[03:44:42.315 --> 03:44:45.716]  Go ahead and play the intro clip of that.
[03:44:45.716 --> 03:44:47.456]  Put that video up on screen.
[03:44:47.456 --> 03:44:57.119]  I'm going back to the previous document I asked for before I asked for Supreme Court justices' articles were there in the USA Today and other places telling you that the U.N.'
[03:44:57.099 --> 03:44:57.819]  's the boss.
[03:44:57.819 --> 03:44:58.339]  Here it is.
[03:44:58.339 --> 03:44:58.639]  Play it.
[03:45:02.995 --> 03:45:12.518]  It's a great opportunity to always observe the Navy Marine Corps team do something together that no one else can do, but it's really important this year because for the first time in 50 years, the U.S.
[03:45:12.518 --> 03:45:21.101]  Navy Marine Corps team is being joined by the Inventaria de Marina from many countries throughout the Latin American region.
[03:45:21.101 --> 03:45:23.481]  So it's a really historic event for us.
[03:45:23.481 --> 03:45:25.522]  I think, personally, I think it's been a long time coming.
[03:45:25.522 --> 03:45:31.664]  It's important because it demonstrates the importance of the relationships between our countries and how
[03:45:31.804 --> 03:45:34.666]  Okay, and then it cuts to tourists on the Florida beach with troops walking around with machine guns.
[03:45:34.666 --> 03:45:34.986]  Now, again...
[03:45:56.486 --> 03:45:58.107]  Let me pull this up for people who are in denial.
[03:45:58.107 --> 03:45:59.548]  People really hate this one.
[03:45:59.548 --> 03:46:02.390]  Those in denial really don't know what to do about this one.
[03:46:02.390 --> 03:46:04.651]  I document everything live on the fly here.
[03:46:04.651 --> 03:46:07.313]  And the guys get a lot of credit for being able to pull this up so quick.
[03:46:07.313 --> 03:46:12.396]  Supreme Court Justice says UN law trumps US law.
[03:46:12.396 --> 03:46:15.178]  That should pull it up for you.
[03:46:15.178 --> 03:46:16.759]  You'll get five of the nine saying it.
[03:46:16.759 --> 03:46:18.020]  They're all meant to come out and say it.
[03:46:20.034 --> 03:46:20.955]  Why does the U.N.
[03:46:20.955 --> 03:46:27.920]  have all this immunity set up by the Rockefellers in 1945 in Presidio, San Francisco and Manhattan, New York, New York?
[03:46:29.645 --> 03:46:30.506]  Why?
[03:46:30.506 --> 03:46:39.834]  Why do we constantly have UN bureaucrats, every week I see it in the news, all over the world, caught running white slavery, caught running drugs?
[03:46:39.834 --> 03:46:42.416]  No one can look in their suitcases.
[03:46:42.416 --> 03:46:46.759]  I mean, if a UN bureaucrat lands with 20 cases, no one can search it.
[03:46:46.759 --> 03:46:56.688]  This is the international crime syndicate of the globalists giving themselves the authorization to engage in white slavery, money laundering, drug shipments,
[03:46:57.759 --> 03:47:08.762]  The UN gets caught under diplomatic immunity with their private contractors like DynCorp and Halliburton on record loading up jets full of little kids and women they've kidnapped.
[03:47:08.762 --> 03:47:13.323]  The giant sex trade, this is on record!
[03:47:13.323 --> 03:47:14.904]  Could UN trump U.S.
[03:47:14.904 --> 03:47:15.724]  Constitution?
[03:47:15.724 --> 03:47:20.525]  I don't know if that's the right article.
[03:47:20.525 --> 03:47:25.227]  Try USA Today behind it, because I remember that headline.
[03:47:25.227 --> 03:47:26.347]  All right, continuing here.
[03:47:28.931 --> 03:47:39.279]  Interpol works closely with international tribunals, such as the International Criminal Court, which the United States has refused to join because of sovereignty-surrendering provisions, though top Obama officials want to use it.
[03:47:39.279 --> 03:47:48.106]  It also works closely with foreign courts and law enforcement authorities, such as those in Europe, that are investigating former Bush administration officials for war crimes.
[03:47:48.106 --> 03:47:54.231]  So they're coming at this of, oh, we don't want that, and then that sells the left on being for it.
[03:47:54.231 --> 03:47:57.134]  Don't worry, Obama's already said he's not going to investigate Bush.
[03:47:58.493 --> 03:48:02.036]  You know, if one UN member votes for it, that means nothing.
[03:48:02.036 --> 03:48:04.658]  Don't worry, the crimes will go unpunished.
[03:48:04.658 --> 03:48:07.380]  But you can't have a kangaroo court try Bush for crimes.
[03:48:07.380 --> 03:48:09.601]  It's got to be a US court.
[03:48:09.601 --> 03:48:12.904]  Why would we elevate an international police force above American law?
[03:48:12.904 --> 03:48:20.630]  Why would we give immunity to an international police force from the limitations that constrain the FBI and other American law enforcement agencies?
[03:48:21.874 --> 03:48:36.325]  Why is it suddenly necessary to have, within the Justice Department, a repository for stashing government files, which therefore will be beyond the ability of Congress, American law enforcement, and the media, and the American people to scrutinize?
[03:48:36.325 --> 03:48:38.886]  Now, that's a good article.
[03:48:38.886 --> 03:48:42.329]  Now, here's another one out of the Jerusalem Post.
[03:48:42.329 --> 03:48:47.272]  We're running out of time here, but Jerusalem Post, December 21st, IDF-U.S.
[03:48:47.272 --> 03:48:49.114]  National Guard shared defense ideas.
[03:48:50.973 --> 03:49:07.713]  And you read the article, and it openly says in the article that, oh, the IDF has liaison officers in all the major branches of the military, but now they're going to have one in the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
[03:49:08.854 --> 03:49:17.084]  And they're going to have one in the Homeland Security, and they're going to deploy to any operations inside the United States.
[03:49:17.084 --> 03:49:25.534]  He will go to training exercises, conferences, and if needed, will deploy with the National Guard to emergency situations, the officer explained.
[03:49:25.534 --> 03:49:27.676]  Can I have a document, Cam, shot?
[03:49:27.676 --> 03:49:28.838]  People will deny this is in here.
[03:49:30.112 --> 03:49:41.277]  I found more hit pieces today on us where they just say Interpol's not taking over, and that none of this is true, and that I'm making it all up, thinking you're stupid and won't look into this.
[03:49:41.277 --> 03:49:45.559]  And of course it always comes from, quote, sources we can trust.
[03:49:45.559 --> 03:49:48.560]  Yeah.
[03:49:48.560 --> 03:49:52.482]  People from our supposed own camp trying to make you live in denial out there about what's happening.
[03:49:55.422 --> 03:50:01.423]  Israel's own Home Front Command National Guard will be bolstered during the operations.
[03:50:01.423 --> 03:50:03.024]  See, they call it Home Front Command.
[03:50:03.024 --> 03:50:05.644]  Here it's Homeland Security.
[03:50:05.644 --> 03:50:06.844]  And it goes on.
[03:50:06.844 --> 03:50:08.025]  So there you go.
[03:50:08.025 --> 03:50:08.485]  Here it is.
[03:50:08.485 --> 03:50:15.146]  Now, again, every time I mention this, I get emails going, well, Mike, yeah, the Explorer Scouts do work with police.
[03:50:15.146 --> 03:50:17.307]  What's wrong with that?
[03:50:17.307 --> 03:50:19.167]  Well, I happen to have the New York Times.
[03:50:20.347 --> 03:50:34.275]  And countless other newspaper articles where Secure Corps, Division of AmeriCorps, and other groups are doing paramilitary training for the last ten years with the federal government to quote, take on disgruntled veterans.
[03:50:34.275 --> 03:50:45.082]  And here is the Daily News, it was also in the Contra Costa Times, LAPD on course to take over Explorer Program completely from the Boy Scouts.
[03:50:45.082 --> 03:50:48.424]  Three thousand young people have already gone through the LAPD program.
[03:50:49.525 --> 03:50:51.848]  Training them to be law enforcement.
[03:50:51.848 --> 03:50:59.418]  And then you go find out what this training entails, and it's taken on American gun owners.
[03:50:59.418 --> 03:51:01.301]  That's in this New York Times article.
[03:51:04.033 --> 03:51:06.054]  Remain in your houses.
[03:51:06.054 --> 03:51:11.815]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:51:11.815 --> 03:51:13.176]  Will they do it?
[03:51:13.176 --> 03:51:15.777]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:51:15.777 --> 03:51:22.238]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:51:22.238 --> 03:51:23.499]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:51:24.439 --> 03:51:28.722]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[03:51:28.722 --> 03:51:33.606]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:51:33.606 --> 03:51:38.509]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:51:38.509 --> 03:51:43.333]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:51:44.253 --> 03:51:52.677]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:51:52.677 --> 03:51:55.179]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:51:55.179 --> 03:51:58.240]  Go to MartialLawSurvival.com right now.
[03:51:58.240 --> 03:52:01.162]  You must remain in your houses until your bracelets are scanned.
[03:52:03.576 --> 03:52:07.599]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.599 --> 03:52:10.842]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.842 --> 03:52:16.006]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:16.006 --> 03:52:22.031]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:22.031 --> 03:52:24.273]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[03:52:24.853 --> 03:52:27.235]  ...as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:27.235 --> 03:52:30.557]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:52:30.557 --> 03:52:37.342]  A criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:37.342 --> 03:52:39.683]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.683 --> 03:52:41.264]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:41.264 --> 03:52:43.726]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.726 --> 03:52:45.848]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.848 --> 03:52:50.531]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.992 --> 03:53:00.109]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:53:02.168 --> 03:53:05.671]  Before you throw away your used batteries, you need to listen to this.
[03:53:05.671 --> 03:53:07.692]  Now, going green can save money.
[03:53:07.692 --> 03:53:13.256]  Go green and save money by giving life to your used batteries by charging them with the Renaissance Charger.
[03:53:13.256 --> 03:53:21.282]  The Renaissance Charger uses a new revolutionary battery charging technology that effectively extends the life of new batteries and gives new life to used batteries.
[03:53:21.282 --> 03:53:31.630]  Invented by legendary audio genius John Bodini, this unique and patented charging system rejuvenates the electrochemical plate structure in the battery without additives, increasing capacity
[03:53:31.790 --> 03:53:32.370]  I think so.
[03:54:06.926 --> 03:54:12.690]  Yeah, we got the definition for inviolable and it was exactly what I thought it was.
[03:54:12.690 --> 03:54:17.414]  Middle English from the Middle French or Latin.
[03:54:17.414 --> 03:54:19.175]  15th century.
[03:54:19.175 --> 03:54:24.879]  It means secure from violation or profanation.
[03:54:24.879 --> 03:54:27.681]  That means the tax man sucking off you.
[03:54:27.681 --> 03:54:30.383]  Secure from assault or trespass.
[03:54:30.383 --> 03:54:34.466]  See, you don't own your property if you pay property taxes.
[03:54:34.466 --> 03:54:35.667]  You are an indentured serf.
[03:54:37.196 --> 03:54:39.959]  This country's no longer free a long time ago.
[03:54:39.959 --> 03:54:43.563]  Property rights is the base.
[03:54:43.563 --> 03:54:48.188]  We now are chattel property of the bankers through fraud.
[03:54:48.188 --> 03:54:55.836]  Any moment we could wake up and say no, but they're using the pretext of terrorism to set up the police state and control our lives.
[03:54:55.836 --> 03:54:57.058]  But I want you to understand this.
[03:54:58.763 --> 03:55:03.148]  They are training your children to spy on you in the public schools publicly.
[03:55:03.148 --> 03:55:08.614]  They are training your kids to come home and boss you around and write up reports on your environmental activities.
[03:55:08.614 --> 03:55:09.415]  They are training
[03:55:10.717 --> 03:55:13.159]  And again, it's in the New York Times saying how great it is.
[03:55:13.159 --> 03:55:17.483]  Scouts trained to fight terrorists and more, disgruntled vets.
[03:55:17.483 --> 03:55:23.769]  And that's photos of the kids going in and doing drills of killing gun owners that won't turn their guns in.
[03:55:23.769 --> 03:55:25.151]  You cannot make this up.
[03:55:25.151 --> 03:55:34.700]  And now, they're just completely taking it away from the Boy Scouts and making it local big city police programs, which are then federally controlled.
[03:55:36.869 --> 03:55:40.271]  In fact, here it is, LAPD on course to take over Explorer Program.
[03:55:40.271 --> 03:55:41.571]  This is going on nationwide.
[03:55:41.571 --> 03:55:49.795]  Again, eight, nine years ago, I saw Secure Corps under the Philadelphia Police Control, under a federal grant.
[03:55:49.795 --> 03:55:50.215]  It's over!
[03:55:51.684 --> 03:55:52.825]  The country's gone.
[03:55:52.825 --> 03:55:56.487]  There's no chance in saving any of it unless we get honest about it.
[03:55:56.487 --> 03:55:58.268]  Now, as U.S.
[03:55:58.268 --> 03:56:10.855]  citizens, as sovereigns, as constitutionalists, as citizens of our states that constitute the federal government, and it's three just powers, we are sovereign.
[03:56:10.855 --> 03:56:12.456]  We are above the government.
[03:56:12.456 --> 03:56:16.619]  Unless we violate someone's rights, their property,
[03:56:17.822 --> 03:56:20.204]  Or hurt someone, unlawfully.
[03:56:20.204 --> 03:56:29.033]  Then a jury of our peers, of other sovereigns, convene, the grand jury, to decide whether you should be indicted.
[03:56:29.033 --> 03:56:40.143]  They then give that order to the judge, to the sheriff, to the bailiff, to the constables, to seize you.
[03:56:40.143 --> 03:56:42.025]  And then you're given due process.
[03:56:42.025 --> 03:56:42.926]  That's being erased.
[03:56:44.444 --> 03:56:46.965]  Citizens don't even really get that anymore.
[03:56:46.965 --> 03:56:49.826]  Instead, the U.N.
[03:56:49.826 --> 03:56:51.546]  is only 60-something years old.
[03:56:51.546 --> 03:56:53.207]  What, 1945?
[03:56:53.207 --> 03:56:57.768]  It sets itself up, private banking front, and says, we're above the law.
[03:56:57.768 --> 03:56:59.008]  No one can arrest us.
[03:56:59.008 --> 03:57:00.169]  No one can stop us.
[03:57:00.169 --> 03:57:03.089]  That's why Maury Strong can commit all these big crimes.
[03:57:03.089 --> 03:57:04.570]  Steal hundreds of millions.
[03:57:04.570 --> 03:57:06.070]  Do nothing.
[03:57:06.070 --> 03:57:10.632]  Diplomatic immunity.
[03:57:10.632 --> 03:57:11.672]  So, they
[03:57:12.796 --> 03:57:21.043]  Go far above the immunity we had from tyranny under the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[03:57:21.043 --> 03:57:23.865]  Your private property never had to pay taxes on it.
[03:57:23.865 --> 03:57:26.007]  Couldn't be taken by the government.
[03:57:26.007 --> 03:57:30.391]  Not even the king, under English common law, could take your home.
[03:57:30.391 --> 03:57:35.655]  Now, you don't pay the taxes, even though there's no way to pay them, they take your property.
[03:57:35.655 --> 03:57:37.457]  You have no sovereignty.
[03:57:37.457 --> 03:57:41.000]  They have godlike, Caesar, Caligula sovereignty.
[03:57:42.366 --> 03:57:57.897]  Whenever a king, whether it was in Babylon, or Egypt, or Greece, or Rome, or England, declared they were God and were above everyone, they would be overthrown as a tyrannous, as a tyrant.
[03:58:00.959 --> 03:58:13.048]  Now, the UN and anyone they designate, and see, your government then designates, our government says, oh, you have immunity, but our own government's a member of it, so they get immunity.
[03:58:13.048 --> 03:58:21.094]  The government is above the law, foreign troops being brought in, brainwashing our kids, turning them against us.
[03:58:21.094 --> 03:58:26.799]  But then we have no sovereignty and no protections, the Patriot Act erases it all.
[03:58:28.049 --> 03:58:30.990]  This is a criminal, rogue government.
[03:58:30.990 --> 03:58:33.831]  It's all exposed in my film, Fall of the Republic.
[03:58:33.831 --> 03:58:35.051]  Great job, crew.
[03:58:35.051 --> 03:58:43.793]  I break down what really happened with this panties bomber coming up.
[03:58:43.793 --> 03:58:47.474]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:47.474 --> 03:58:49.195]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.803 --> 03:58:56.365]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:56.365 --> 03:58:57.266]  Number one.
[03:58:57.266 --> 03:59:00.688]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.688 --> 03:59:01.548]  Number two.
[03:59:01.548 --> 03:59:06.451]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.451 --> 03:59:07.191]  It's true.
[03:59:07.191 --> 03:59:11.734]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:12.054 --> 03:59:12.875]  Number 3.
[03:59:12.875 --> 03:59:16.458]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:16.458 --> 03:59:20.382]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:20.382 --> 03:59:21.182]  Number 4.
[03:59:21.182 --> 03:59:23.945]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:59:23.945 --> 03:59:27.628]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:27.628 --> 03:59:28.409]  Number 5.
[03:59:28.409 --> 03:59:32.553]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:59:32.553 --> 03:59:37.317]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:59:37.597 --> 03:59:41.781]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
