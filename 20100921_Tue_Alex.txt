[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.300]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.300 --> 00:35.020]  Texas Alex Jones we're live it is Tuesday the 21st day of September 2010
[00:35.020 --> 00:41.560]  coming up in this third hour Judith McGeary an attorney and a small family
[00:41.560 --> 00:46.700]  farmer will be joining us she's one of the most well researched and outspoken
[00:46.700 --> 00:53.300]  critics of the legislation they're trying to pass this week and I've read
[00:53.300 --> 00:58.820]  the legislation it basically could be interpreted to say that you can't make
[00:58.820 --> 01:04.220]  strawberry jam yourself and even give it to friends and family or sell it or you
[01:04.220 --> 01:14.300]  can't go out in the backyard and pick cucumbers and can them and make them as
[01:14.300 --> 01:20.220]  a batch of pickles to sell and this is designed by big mega agribusiness to
[01:20.220 --> 01:25.580]  shut down the small family farm they've changed the IRS rules where they
[01:25.580 --> 01:30.460]  basically increase the taxes on what they call hobby farms if your farmer
[01:30.460 --> 01:34.860]  ranch isn't making money then they increase the tax rate and get rid of
[01:34.860 --> 01:42.420]  all the tax exemptions that was changed what four years ago and most farms and
[01:42.420 --> 01:47.400]  ranches are hobby farms you know daddy and mama work in town at the hardware
[01:47.400 --> 01:52.820]  store or at the prison or at the power plant or at the university but then
[01:52.820 --> 01:56.820]  they've normally got a small piece of the family farm that you know great
[01:56.820 --> 01:59.780]  granddaddy bought a hundred years before and over time they've had to sell off
[01:59.780 --> 02:05.260]  most of it but they may have 20 30 40 acres sometimes just a few acres and
[02:05.260 --> 02:08.940]  governments coming in with zoning and shutting down those small farms
[02:08.940 --> 02:13.460]  nationwide and we've covered that and they're coming in and saying if your
[02:13.460 --> 02:17.820]  farm doesn't make money we're going to increase the taxes on you and not give
[02:17.820 --> 02:26.980]  you your farming tax deductions and I know that's even going on with my own
[02:26.980 --> 02:33.220]  family and and so then once they've run your farm or ranch out of business they
[02:33.220 --> 02:38.220]  can then raise the property taxes on your land it's no longer having an
[02:38.220 --> 02:41.900]  agriculture exemption at the state level once the feds have made that
[02:41.900 --> 02:46.060]  designation and you lose your property and so they're doing everything they can
[02:46.060 --> 02:50.780]  on record to shut down the family farms and ranches that don't really make
[02:50.780 --> 02:56.460]  money on average but allow people to continue that lifestyle continue that
[02:56.460 --> 03:00.780]  culture continue that connection to the land and it does produce a lot of the
[03:00.780 --> 03:07.340]  produce and a lot of the meat beef poultry pork that ends up on our dinner
[03:07.340 --> 03:12.740]  tables on our breakfast tables on our lunch tables but getting rid of the tax
[03:12.740 --> 03:17.180]  exemptions at the federal and state level on top of all the new regulations
[03:17.180 --> 03:22.540]  and harassment I mean take the real ID for the American people that's designed
[03:22.540 --> 03:26.860]  to track everywhere you work and what you do ultimately forcing everyone into
[03:26.860 --> 03:32.300]  automatic cash transfer check transfer to the bank and then the feds along what I
[03:32.300 --> 03:35.980]  call the finished model can directly take the money out of your bank account
[03:35.980 --> 03:39.180]  and when I talked about the finished model yesterday I specifically was
[03:39.180 --> 03:43.420]  talking about they were the first country I saw where they began to give the
[03:43.420 --> 03:47.540]  government full control over your bank account and try to force employers to
[03:47.540 --> 03:54.420]  deposit checks by automatic transfer and then the government could just deduct
[03:54.420 --> 03:59.380]  new taxes directly out of your bank account similar systems are used
[03:59.380 --> 04:03.940]  worldwide where you'll notice every year there's new fees on your cable modem on
[04:03.940 --> 04:09.700]  your cable service new fees on your cell phone service that's just added
[04:09.700 --> 04:14.300]  Congress doesn't pass it it's just a regulatory system and that's designed to
[04:14.300 --> 04:19.180]  track and trace and control you and further destroy the economy and
[04:19.180 --> 04:24.100]  consolidate power but it's the same thing with the premises ID animal ID you
[04:24.100 --> 04:30.700]  got to pay depending on the regulation you look at 10 to $14 per tag and you've
[04:30.700 --> 04:35.620]  got to have the same tag for cows chickens goats you name it well the
[04:35.620 --> 04:40.580]  chicken is not worth $14 on average but then if you look at Tyson chicken who
[04:40.580 --> 04:47.300]  lobbied for it and they have a world you know chicken near monopoly more than
[04:47.300 --> 04:52.500]  half the market globally they can have one tag per 10,000 chickens but you've
[04:52.500 --> 04:56.100]  got to have a tag per chicken puts you out of business vertically integrates
[04:56.100 --> 05:02.500]  the market that's all coming up stay with us you've heard Alex explain how the
[05:02.500 --> 05:06.300]  silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced
[05:06.300 --> 05:10.260]  colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the
[05:10.260 --> 05:13.820]  silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[05:13.820 --> 05:18.980]  anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of
[05:18.980 --> 05:23.340]  the silver lungs generator not only does the silver lung system produce endless
[05:23.340 --> 05:27.460]  colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper
[05:27.460 --> 05:31.940]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to
[05:31.940 --> 05:39.420]  key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to the skin and
[05:39.420 --> 05:43.700]  orally for the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven-minute video
[05:43.700 --> 05:49.860]  tour of the silver lung system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about
[05:49.860 --> 05:54.540]  how the silver lung system works as well we are always ready to answer any
[05:54.540 --> 06:00.980]  questions you may have that's www.silverlungs.com this is Alex Jones with
[06:00.980 --> 06:04.740]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[06:04.740 --> 06:08.500]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[06:08.500 --> 06:13.020]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[06:13.020 --> 06:17.260]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[06:17.260 --> 06:21.860]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[06:21.860 --> 06:25.820]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[06:25.820 --> 06:29.980]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[06:29.980 --> 06:33.940]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[06:33.940 --> 06:38.100]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[06:38.100 --> 06:41.900]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[06:41.900 --> 06:45.420]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[06:45.420 --> 06:50.620]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[06:50.620 --> 06:54.860]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to my solar

[08:25.500 --> 08:37.220]  waging war on corruption it's Alex Jones welcome my friends it is Tuesday the
[08:37.220 --> 08:42.500]  21st day of September 2010 we do have Judith McGeary attorney and small
[08:42.500 --> 08:47.340]  family farm owner one of the leading researchers and experts valiantly
[08:47.340 --> 08:55.860]  fighting the UN written plan known as Agenda 21 being implemented worldwide
[08:55.860 --> 09:01.740]  they're trying this week to not just pass the Dream Act to legalize millions of
[09:01.740 --> 09:05.460]  illegal aliens and fill the military with them and give them free welfare in
[09:05.460 --> 09:13.860]  college they are also trying to ram through this takeover of this expanded
[09:13.860 --> 09:21.300]  takeover of family farms and ranches it will basically make it illegal to can
[09:21.300 --> 09:27.300]  strawberries and give it to your friends and family or sell it and of course
[09:27.300 --> 09:33.060]  they've harassed the whole milk producers almost out of business here in
[09:33.060 --> 09:37.940]  Austin we would try to go down and buy whole milk from great local dairies
[09:37.940 --> 09:43.300]  family dairies statistically much cleaner much more healthy much better for
[09:43.300 --> 09:47.140]  you and they have undercover police and don't allow it to shut it down like we
[09:47.140 --> 09:51.460]  were down there trying to buy cocaine or something they're now shutting down the
[09:51.460 --> 09:54.700]  cheese makers they're shutting down people selling tomatoes on street corners
[09:54.700 --> 10:00.980]  from Oklahoma to North Carolina in just the last week I've seen articles where
[10:00.980 --> 10:05.700]  they're going to people who have been on their land for decades with small truck
[10:05.700 --> 10:11.780]  farms growing lettuce and tomatoes and things like that squash and they're
[10:11.780 --> 10:15.460]  shutting them down and just saying we don't care of your zone to be able to
[10:15.460 --> 10:20.740]  grow this you're not going to do it and if you study the Soviet model of total
[10:20.740 --> 10:26.260]  control that's what's happening the city of Austin won't fill the potholes has
[10:26.260 --> 10:30.620]  passed giant carbon taxes 2.6 billion in the next three years to be phased in
[10:30.620 --> 10:35.200]  larger than all of their taxes combined they're busy with secret undercover
[10:35.200 --> 10:40.060]  police at the parks and at the other areas if you try to take three people
[10:40.060 --> 10:44.660]  out there a part of a jogging class or a yoga class or you take people to Barton
[10:44.660 --> 10:49.700]  Springs for a swimming class they're finding and feeding you saying you've
[10:49.700 --> 10:54.180]  got to have a license to do that this is all about training you that you have no
[10:54.180 --> 10:58.700]  liberties you have no freedoms everything you're doing is being watched
[10:58.700 --> 11:04.860]  all over the country cities like Dallas and others are passing giant taxes where
[11:04.860 --> 11:09.980]  you get huge prison sentences if you don't get a permit and then pay huge
[11:09.980 --> 11:19.780]  fees to have a garage sale or to have a little stall at say the gun show or the
[11:19.780 --> 11:24.540]  bizarre or the flea market and and really most people don't make any real
[11:24.540 --> 11:28.700]  money doing this but it as the economy shuts down people are getting more and
[11:28.700 --> 11:32.700]  more into barter and barely surviving off of selling off what they owned and
[11:32.700 --> 11:37.940]  that's just not allowed we live in a Soviet type culture but it's not
[11:37.940 --> 11:41.220]  communist in the way the general public's been taught for the workers for
[11:41.220 --> 11:45.180]  the people communism is always to consolidate wealth that's then transferred
[11:45.180 --> 11:50.780]  to offshore oligarchs and that's exactly what is happening here so they've got
[11:50.780 --> 11:55.260]  legislation to basically legalize millions of illegal aliens tagged on to
[11:55.260 --> 12:02.980]  the Defense Authorization Act for 2011 set to pass any time this week but some
[12:02.980 --> 12:07.180]  in the Senate are bulking that they've added getting rid of don't ask don't
[12:07.180 --> 12:15.020]  tell that's a political football issue they should be bulking over the Dream
[12:15.020 --> 12:18.940]  Act which further legalizes illegal aliens and allows them to bring their
[12:18.940 --> 12:24.620]  families here and of course they're also trying to ram through the two
[12:24.620 --> 12:28.740]  different bills that viciously attack what's left of family farms and ranches
[12:28.740 --> 12:32.260]  so we'll be discussing that even if you don't have a family farm or ranch this
[12:32.260 --> 12:37.220]  affects you in food prices and the economy and small towns and the health
[12:37.220 --> 12:41.700]  of this nation it is the stated goal of the White House science are it is the
[12:41.700 --> 12:45.700]  stated goal of the United Nations we read over this Sunday on air with the
[12:45.700 --> 12:49.180]  Sunday broadcast 4 to 6 central and yesterday I spent a lot of time over an
[12:49.180 --> 12:54.340]  hour on it with their quotes from the UN from the Club of Rome from the State
[12:54.340 --> 12:58.460]  Department from the White House science are from the head climatologist at
[12:58.460 --> 13:04.580]  NASA saying we want to deindustrialize the West we want to bankrupt people
[13:04.580 --> 13:08.700]  where they're so poor they can't even afford to have children and then under
[13:08.700 --> 13:11.940]  the new rules if you are poor and have children they're going to try to take
[13:11.940 --> 13:18.540]  them see this is a military financial Armageddon being carried out and any
[13:18.540 --> 13:22.060]  old-timer went to the depression can tell you the banks were happy to give
[13:22.060 --> 13:25.940]  loans ahead of the engineered depression because wealth is not destroyed it is
[13:25.940 --> 13:31.660]  merely transferred so the bank loans you money it makes up out of nothing it's
[13:31.660 --> 13:38.380]  just on a ballot sheet now on computers today they want your property they want
[13:38.380 --> 13:41.900]  your land have you ever done a deed search out in the country anywhere in
[13:41.900 --> 13:46.300]  this country you can randomly do it and see who owns most the land there are
[13:46.300 --> 13:50.420]  thousands of banks that don't even have tellers that don't even have offices
[13:50.420 --> 13:57.420]  they did 50 60 70 80 years ago all they are now is private trust of the
[13:57.420 --> 14:02.260]  globalist and most of the land in this country that's supposedly private isn't
[14:02.260 --> 14:07.780]  even you know owned by local individuals it's owned by banks who stole it from
[14:07.780 --> 14:13.140]  families decades ago and they do this over and over again this is their system
[14:13.140 --> 14:17.660]  and it's stated and people are gonna have to have the courage to admit this to
[14:17.660 --> 14:23.540]  themselves and that's all the banker bailout and stimulus packages were we
[14:23.540 --> 14:27.380]  haven't gotten new numbers in eight months from the federal government last
[14:27.380 --> 14:32.860]  time we got numbers eight months ago Bloomberg reported that it was 23.7
[14:32.860 --> 14:38.460]  trillion dollars in fact pull that up guys cost of bailout 23.7 trailer will
[14:38.460 --> 14:44.380]  come up Bloomberg AP now remember you've got to pay interest to the private
[14:44.380 --> 14:48.460]  bankers on that so it's astronomically larger and impossible to pay back but
[14:48.460 --> 14:52.260]  they get all the real assets but I came up with a number of 28 trillion because
[14:52.260 --> 14:56.380]  Bloomberg went on to report an additional four plus trillion of added bailout
[14:56.380 --> 15:04.300]  but we haven't gotten new numbers either it is 23.7 trillion to US rescue
[15:04.300 --> 15:09.620]  may reach 23.7 trillion and there's another article actually with a similar
[15:09.620 --> 15:15.980]  headline where it conclusively says it's over 23.7 trillion but 23.7 28 I mean
[15:15.980 --> 15:20.020]  you know it's all devastating it's a financial black hole it's impossible to
[15:20.020 --> 15:25.580]  pay back but I've got a Houston Chronicle detailed analysis here Texas
[15:25.580 --> 15:34.260]  reaped 4.6 billion from federal stimulus of the 4.6 billion dollars 47,704
[15:34.260 --> 15:44.860]  jobs were created and that comes out to 96,727 dollars per job and the average
[15:44.860 --> 15:53.860]  job only paid the person around $30,000 so two-thirds of the money or more goes
[15:53.860 --> 15:59.900]  to the bureaucracy goes to the select corporations that were given the lion's
[15:59.900 --> 16:04.540]  share of the money and the government agencies that doled it out and most of
[16:04.540 --> 16:08.380]  those jobs by the way were in the government sector and for every
[16:08.380 --> 16:13.220]  government job it statistically historically takes two free market jobs
[16:13.220 --> 16:24.940]  away this is even worse though if it cost 4.6 billion to get 47,000 jobs and
[16:24.940 --> 16:29.740]  more than half of those were government jobs so that'll cost further jobs and
[16:29.740 --> 16:33.420]  those will be jobs that are now put into place and then after the stimulus goes
[16:33.420 --> 16:37.820]  away which it's already done then they'll have to raise new local taxes to fund
[16:37.820 --> 16:41.380]  them see what the federal government does it comes in and it brings in police
[16:41.380 --> 16:46.340]  funding education funding highway funding water district funding and then two
[16:46.340 --> 16:50.180]  years later or in some cases a year later like this the money's gone and they
[16:50.180 --> 16:53.740]  come in with lobbyists that say okay what you do is you privatize your water
[16:53.740 --> 16:58.700]  you paid for these dams of the last 50 plus years you paid in taxes to have the
[16:58.700 --> 17:02.740]  infrastructure built now we're going to privatize it but it isn't really
[17:02.740 --> 17:06.100]  privatizing it's like if the government came with guns and you know ordered you
[17:06.100 --> 17:08.860]  to hand your house over to a private interest that's not privatization and
[17:08.860 --> 17:14.380]  then they take over the infrastructure and then jack up prices so they get the
[17:14.380 --> 17:18.580]  huge investment in some cases that goes back hundreds of years of the dams the
[17:18.580 --> 17:22.940]  waterways the water districts the power systems the roads they get all that
[17:22.940 --> 17:27.820]  infrastructure for nothing to just administer it and then they raise the
[17:27.820 --> 17:33.820]  prices to quote pay for all the new government jobs that were created and
[17:33.820 --> 17:38.540]  that's the deal is that then those private firms then give part of the money
[17:38.540 --> 17:44.380]  back to the government through government contracts so it's it's it's the
[17:44.380 --> 17:55.660]  reverse the bottom line is this is a planned coordinated operation this is
[17:55.660 --> 17:59.780]  just Texas one of 50 states American taxpayers have thrown 4.6 billion into
[17:59.780 --> 18:04.340]  emergency projects across Texas over the past 19 months to salvage the Lone
[18:04.340 --> 18:08.820]  Star state economy so oh it's salvaged our economy now our economy is the best
[18:08.820 --> 18:13.620]  in the country because we have smaller government than any other state and more
[18:13.620 --> 18:18.580]  private property I mean Texas has the best economy in the country and not that
[18:18.580 --> 18:21.780]  it's great but it's better than others because we have smaller government not
[18:21.780 --> 18:25.500]  because of government so you see it to love that message there you know oh the
[18:25.500 --> 18:30.220]  illegal aliens help the economy oh the feds help the economy yeah that's like
[18:30.220 --> 18:35.020]  saying in case a gangrene helps your toes when they're falling off amid the
[18:35.020 --> 18:39.340]  nation's worst downturn since the Great Depression that means each Texas job has
[18:39.340 --> 18:43.740]  cost taxpayers 96,727 dollars according to a
[18:43.740 --> 18:47.460]  euthan chronicle analysis of federal stimulus funds and then it goes through
[18:47.460 --> 18:51.460]  all of the types of jobs and the rest of it and have several other reports up on
[18:51.460 --> 18:56.740]  prisonplanet.com and infowars.com dealing with that I have another big stack of
[18:56.740 --> 19:00.380]  news on the economy where all these private economists and major companies
[19:00.380 --> 19:03.860]  are saying this is a depression our earnings are way down unless you're in
[19:03.860 --> 19:07.860]  the banking sector those are way up because it's a consolidation it's a
[19:07.860 --> 19:14.620]  looting but the feds said yesterday we read the headline they said that we left
[19:14.620 --> 19:20.300]  the recession in June of last year that that everything is wonderful so what are
[19:20.300 --> 19:26.340]  you complaining about just more lies and as the credibility of the government
[19:26.340 --> 19:31.420]  and the select group of corporations that have grown up around it drops their
[19:31.420 --> 19:36.900]  answer is accelerate more lies more corruption more disinformation so we'll
[19:36.900 --> 19:39.620]  be talking about all of that after the break and then of course we're gonna be
[19:39.620 --> 19:46.860]  discussing Obama's aunt she says quote if I come here as an illegal immigrant
[19:46.860 --> 19:50.980]  you have the obligation to make me a citizen and that's what these illegals
[19:50.980 --> 19:55.620]  are told they're told you come here you get on welfare and you're gonna be made
[19:55.620 --> 19:59.100]  a citizen and you just vote to take these people's guns and they say
[19:59.100 --> 20:02.820]  absolutely I'm ready to do it making the right decisions is a challenge to
[20:02.820 --> 20:06.660]  investors are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or at

[20:18.780 --> 20:22.820]  what do you do when the US government overextends itself and spends beyond its

[24:06.700 --> 24:17.860]  the federal government here in the United States has been researching a move to
[24:17.860 --> 24:23.300]  basically start taking your paychecks and running it through the federal
[24:23.300 --> 24:27.580]  government first and they will take out the taxes and of course so companies
[24:27.580 --> 24:32.420]  like ADP that process a lot of payroll won't get angry the government will use
[24:32.420 --> 24:36.740]  private contractors to do it so they still get their piece of the pie but
[24:36.740 --> 24:41.100]  then select corporations will only get the job the smaller payroll companies
[24:41.100 --> 24:44.820]  will be out of business I have seen that in the literature proposed they're
[24:44.820 --> 24:51.020]  officially trying to launch that right now over in the United Kingdom and it's
[24:51.020 --> 24:55.460]  the exact same global corporate model I remember seven years ago England started
[24:55.460 --> 25:00.380]  putting tracker chips in the trash cans that would scan basically what you were
[25:00.380 --> 25:04.780]  throwing away they were hiring citizens to look through the trash at minimum
[25:04.780 --> 25:09.020]  wage to then tattle on you if you weren't recycling properly that's now
[25:09.020 --> 25:14.580]  being implemented in multiple US cities the exact same system so everything you
[25:14.580 --> 25:18.460]  see in England the face scanning cameras a decade ago the license plate
[25:18.460 --> 25:23.580]  reading cameras 15 years ago now being implemented here the microphones on
[25:23.580 --> 25:28.100]  street corners being called gunshot detectors now they admit actually we're
[25:28.100 --> 25:33.860]  listening to your conversations it's a global government with global models
[25:33.860 --> 25:37.420]  they develop the technologies their private companies are then given
[25:37.420 --> 25:44.740]  government contracts to make money out of surveilling you then they control all
[25:44.740 --> 25:50.580]  of the major tuitions they fund the grants they fund the scholarships
[25:50.580 --> 25:54.380]  converting the economy over where if you want to go to college or get a job
[25:54.380 --> 25:59.380]  it's going to be running these systems or developing these systems what do we
[25:59.380 --> 26:03.940]  produce in America jailguards biggest prison population in the world biggest
[26:03.940 --> 26:09.340]  part of our economy now run administered by major defense contractors who runs
[26:09.340 --> 26:12.740]  the face scanning cameras who runs the biometric thumb scanners to buy and
[26:12.740 --> 26:17.100]  sell who runs the license plate readers who runs the naked body scanners who
[26:17.100 --> 26:21.820]  runs the 500 plus that was one purchase last year of mobile x-ray vans that
[26:21.820 --> 26:27.100]  shoot through your house super high-power dwarfing chest x-rays defense
[26:27.100 --> 26:31.620]  contractors they are taken over they've overthrown countless third-world
[26:31.620 --> 26:35.460]  countries why shouldn't they overthrow this country they've done it
[26:35.460 --> 26:39.940]  Eisenhower warned us a technological elite controlling the military industrial
[26:39.940 --> 26:45.420]  complex that's his full quote not just the military industrial complex he
[26:45.420 --> 26:49.740]  talked about who controlled it and already the biggest army navy marine
[26:49.740 --> 26:55.100]  court recruiting centers it's not the case for the Air Force are in Manila
[26:55.100 --> 27:00.540]  Philippines Mexico City Mexico they're in Eastern Europe and you go to a
[27:00.540 --> 27:03.740]  military base now and they even put them in units together it's just foreigners
[27:03.740 --> 27:08.820]  and they're taught to hate this country they're not brought here and taught to
[27:08.820 --> 27:14.540]  love it and they're taught you deserve free health care you deserve to fly in
[27:14.540 --> 27:19.940]  from Mexico City or to fly in from China or to fly in from Eastern Europe and to
[27:19.940 --> 27:24.700]  instantly have your baby paid for and to instantly have full welfare and your
[27:24.700 --> 27:29.940]  whole family legalized but if you're a skilled person from Australia or South
[27:29.940 --> 27:33.780]  Africa or Western Europe it's almost impossible to come over here even the guy
[27:33.780 --> 27:39.740]  they want to host for Larry King live top British broadcaster has had to
[27:39.740 --> 27:44.460]  suspend coming here till next year because he can't get a worker visa but
[27:44.460 --> 27:48.700]  you're Obama's aunt his whole family is over here they're all illegal aliens
[27:48.700 --> 27:53.140]  they've been here for decades they get free welfare they don't work and when
[27:53.140 --> 27:58.260]  she gets asked about it she says you owe it to me you owe it to me this is the
[27:58.260 --> 28:06.900]  foreign army of weak bedwetting parasites who are the voting army who
[28:06.900 --> 28:10.660]  we're gonna take your farm your ranch your guns your kids everything and the
[28:10.660 --> 28:14.380]  SWAT teams are a bunch of foreigners these federal army SWAT teams they're
[28:14.380 --> 28:18.860]  creating this is hell this is the British 200 plus years ago landed German
[28:18.860 --> 28:23.140]  troops here they now land a motley crew of foreigners and slap American flags
[28:23.140 --> 28:27.820]  on their arms but teach them to hate this country now we may not even be able
[28:27.820 --> 28:31.540]  to repair things even if you'd wake up and take action but if you sit there and
[28:31.540 --> 28:37.660]  and live in denial it's over now here is his hand the illegal alien on welfare
[28:37.660 --> 28:45.820]  saying you owe me everything scum here it is Zatuni on Yango lives in South
[28:45.820 --> 28:51.260]  Boston in public housing she's unemployed she collects disability and
[28:51.260 --> 28:56.260]  assisting her nephew never pulled any strings for her recently she sat down
[28:56.260 --> 29:00.420]  for an exclusive interview with Jonathan Elias and Jonathan she's not
[29:00.420 --> 29:04.980]  making any apologies Jack she makes none in fact she's very fiery the mention
[29:04.980 --> 29:08.940]  of her name makes many in Boston angry angry because she is living off of a
[29:08.940 --> 29:13.020]  system that she's never paid into angry because she is from a family that is now
[29:13.020 --> 29:21.340]  very wealthy yet she remains a burden to Massachusetts taxpayers if I come as an
[29:21.340 --> 29:27.540]  immigrant you have the obligation to make me a citizen this is President
[29:27.540 --> 29:32.020]  Obama's aunt a woman may say is the poster child of our broken immigration
[29:32.020 --> 29:37.060]  system right back and they always call it broken and their solution is let
[29:37.060 --> 29:42.060]  billions in and then Hollywood will produce movies where the foreigners
[29:42.060 --> 29:46.180]  hack us up with machetes of course then who's gonna pay for all your welfare

[34:07.400 --> 34:12.980]  obedience to God it's Alex Jones
[34:15.700 --> 34:21.180]  I don't know where to start on this whole Obama situation and the fact that
[34:21.180 --> 34:28.380]  at least five of his Kenyan family are here living on welfare for free you know
[34:28.380 --> 34:33.460]  really the bigger issue is what type of person who's conservatively made ten
[34:33.460 --> 34:39.820]  million dollars in the last decade off book sales and the rest of it and stock
[34:39.820 --> 34:45.620]  would not help his family I personally have some family who've been on hard
[34:45.620 --> 34:52.620]  times off and on and I've given them quite a bit of money and it's because
[34:52.620 --> 35:00.660]  charity starts at home and I also have given money to handicapped children
[35:00.660 --> 35:07.260]  charities and other things that I know actually help people you know a lot of
[35:07.260 --> 35:10.380]  charity is making sure you're not giving to a bad group because so many of them
[35:10.380 --> 35:15.020]  are corrupt and bad but you can't let that stop you but can you imagine
[35:15.020 --> 35:20.660]  Michelle Obama's very wealthy Obama is very wealthy Barry Sataro and he doesn't
[35:20.660 --> 35:25.020]  meet with he doesn't see his family he does he met with him when he was younger
[35:25.020 --> 35:32.020]  in Kenya and the media basically has ignored this and then his aunt gets up
[35:32.020 --> 35:35.460]  on television and says I you know she came here illegally that's on record
[35:35.460 --> 35:38.820]  she's on a whole bunch of welfare the highest level of welfare you could be
[35:38.820 --> 35:43.380]  on she's on disability she's living in government housing she's got money to
[35:43.380 --> 35:47.220]  be wearing nice clothes and having her hair all done up and she's sitting up
[35:47.220 --> 35:52.980]  there saying you owe it to me and she says it with disgust this is the big
[35:52.980 --> 35:59.140]  banker's army our military is full of foreigners I mean directly illegal
[35:59.140 --> 36:02.380]  aliens they're gonna make them legal put them in they've already been doing it
[36:02.380 --> 36:06.300]  now they're gonna accelerate it free tuition remember all the cases in Texas
[36:06.300 --> 36:10.820]  and Utah they'll come out in the last few years we're in-state citizens pay
[36:10.820 --> 36:16.100]  more for college than illegal aliens and then out of state citizens pay even
[36:16.100 --> 36:24.820]  more because you are an enemy you are hated you are to be bankrupted now
[36:24.820 --> 36:28.340]  once we're completely bankrupt and the depressions run its course the
[36:28.340 --> 36:32.460]  illegals aren't going to get all these freebies anymore after they voted to take
[36:32.460 --> 36:37.180]  the guns and form the great military of the you know the foreign mercenary
[36:37.180 --> 36:43.180]  military our main military is now a foreign army predominantly and they've
[36:43.180 --> 36:50.860]  got the hundreds of thousands over half a million private mercs we've seen this
[36:50.860 --> 36:55.780]  before in history but but think about the brazen arrogance and you know why
[36:55.780 --> 37:00.180]  they're coming out openly and admitting all this because over 51% of the
[37:00.180 --> 37:03.500]  American people are on welfare or they're on corporate welfare they're
[37:03.500 --> 37:08.180]  getting some type of government contractor hand out it is hard to find
[37:08.180 --> 37:12.500]  people who aren't on the government dole and when you do their taxes are going
[37:12.500 --> 37:18.380]  up and so they're laying people off you know I'm looking for revenue streams
[37:18.380 --> 37:23.420]  with prison planet TV and video and book sales not to just expand as we need to
[37:23.420 --> 37:31.820]  do in the face of this tyranny but to continue to be able to even continue at
[37:31.820 --> 37:35.380]  the level we're at I have to look at the numbers and I have to look at who's
[37:35.380 --> 37:41.620]  productive and who's the most productive but not if you've got a government job
[37:41.620 --> 37:45.860]  or not of your own welfare but I want to tell Republicans something that I hear
[37:45.860 --> 37:49.420]  all self-righteously on talk radio this morning talking about Obama's aunt
[37:49.420 --> 37:53.100]  saying you owe me the money you owe it to me I'm gonna come here and you're gonna
[37:53.100 --> 38:02.660]  bankroll me two trillion dollars plus 1.1 trillion on budget 800 plus billion
[38:02.660 --> 38:08.100]  supplemental 300 to 400 to 500 some years in other black op funding so I
[38:08.100 --> 38:13.580]  actually it's well over two trillion 1.1 8 trillion I mean 1.1 trillion 800
[38:13.580 --> 38:20.860]  billion is 1.9 trillion then 300 to 400 on top of that so we're talking 2.2 2.3
[38:20.860 --> 38:26.820]  depending on the year trillion there's your welfare but but you notice now it's
[38:26.820 --> 38:32.180]  free college and all this for anybody that will join the military if you're an
[38:32.180 --> 38:36.700]  illegal alien and if you read the Dream Act it's even more expansive than that
[38:36.700 --> 38:41.740]  and then you've got all these hard-working immigrants from Latin America Asia
[38:41.740 --> 38:47.580]  Europe who can't come here you try to go through the channels it's almost
[38:47.580 --> 38:55.500]  impossible and people say well the system will just collapse they estimate
[38:55.500 --> 38:59.540]  within just a few years it'll be 60% or more on government dull you've already
[38:59.540 --> 39:04.220]  got 43 million plus people on food stamps and it's growing that's a high-tech
[39:04.220 --> 39:07.700]  version you know they don't have paper stamps anymore it's a swipe card looks
[39:07.700 --> 39:10.820]  like a credit card and I'll be standing there at the grocery store line watching
[39:10.820 --> 39:14.140]  people and a large percentage of them are swiping the card I'm looking at their
[39:14.140 --> 39:18.500]  card you think well things will just collapse it's left in someday no once
[39:18.500 --> 39:21.620]  it fully starts collapsing the government will use that crisis to get even more
[39:21.620 --> 39:33.500]  power now let's play his aunt with what she had to say with Boston television WBZ
[39:33.500 --> 39:40.220]  television here it is yet she remains a burden to Massachusetts taxpayers if I
[39:40.220 --> 39:48.260]  come as an immigrant you have the obligation to make me a citizen this is
[39:48.260 --> 39:52.580]  president Obama's aunt a woman many say is the poster child of our broken
[39:52.580 --> 40:01.040]  immigration system we only found out about her back in 2008 it was the
[40:01.040 --> 40:04.660]  weekend before the November election Democratic presidential nominee
[40:04.660 --> 40:09.260]  senator Barack Obama started getting questions about his aunt Zaytuni on
[40:09.260 --> 40:14.460]  Yango of Kenya an illegal immigrant living in public housing in Boston you're
[40:14.460 --> 40:18.060]  here illegally and he's running for the president United States that's what I'm
[40:18.060 --> 40:23.420]  saying is listen Obama did not know my whereabouts for the first time Zaytuni
[40:23.420 --> 40:27.540]  is setting the record straight sitting down with me for this interview she had
[40:27.540 --> 40:31.540]  come to the United States in 2000 and says she had ever all right and then
[40:31.540 --> 40:35.180]  some of her family some of her family's been here for more than 20 years the
[40:35.180 --> 40:42.100]  point is that she's been here for a decade she came here illegally and she
[40:42.100 --> 40:47.540]  says you owe it to me and what do you want to bet that woman would vote to take
[40:47.540 --> 40:53.060]  your guns take your farm take your ranch because you owe it to her it's like in
[40:53.060 --> 40:57.460]  Zimbabwe they're taking people's farms and killing them because it's owed to the
[40:57.460 --> 41:07.180]  people it's owed to her it's owed to her and that's the attitude and what do you
[41:07.180 --> 41:09.540]  think's going to happen as the depression gets worse and worse over the
[41:09.540 --> 41:14.820]  next decade this slow slide into total degradation they're going to form the
[41:14.820 --> 41:22.540]  giant hordes of inner city people on welfare people on the Appalachians you
[41:22.540 --> 41:27.020]  name it everybody dependent on the system into a voting army they already are
[41:27.020 --> 41:31.580]  but even more so and they're going to be hyped up and told you do this for the
[41:31.580 --> 41:36.940]  government you'll get your free handouts that's democracy two wolves and a sheep
[41:36.940 --> 41:41.300]  voting on what's for dinner as Thomas Jefferson said and if you had two wolves
[41:41.300 --> 41:44.340]  and a sheep and a democracy and they had a vote what do you think the wolves are
[41:44.340 --> 41:48.700]  going to vote for let's have a vote on what's for dinner hmm there's two wolves
[41:48.700 --> 41:53.100]  and one sheep what's for dinner the sheep but see the American people aren't
[41:53.100 --> 41:56.300]  supposed to be sheep we're armed with the First Amendment we're armed with the
[41:56.300 --> 41:58.780]  Second Amendment to defend ourselves against common criminals and government
[41:58.780 --> 42:03.340]  criminals we are armed with the Fourth Amendment to protect our papers and
[42:03.340 --> 42:08.220]  private effects in our homes all of that's out the window the shields are
[42:08.220 --> 42:14.020]  down I want to open the phones up for listeners on this subject the toll-free
[42:14.020 --> 42:20.660]  number to join us is 1-800-259-9231 on all the issues I've been discussing and
[42:20.660 --> 42:25.060]  again it's first-time callers today I love giving first-time callers in fact if
[42:25.060 --> 42:27.900]  you were first-time callers yesterday when we into the show we had a lot of
[42:27.900 --> 42:31.900]  people on hold call back in we'll go to the head of the line first-time callers
[42:31.900 --> 42:36.260]  only and then we'll have open phones for farmers and ranchers being harassed by
[42:36.260 --> 42:39.660]  government and all the different permutations will analyze the attack
[42:39.660 --> 42:43.180]  profile of the enemy the full spectrum attack not just the new draconian
[42:43.180 --> 42:46.940]  legislation in the last hour that'll be open phones for everyone who wants to
[42:46.940 --> 42:49.860]  comment on farming and ranching and what's happening there and how we're
[42:49.860 --> 42:53.860]  basically going into total serfdom and serfdom was where the government whether
[42:53.860 --> 42:58.140]  it was Japan or England same system would only let you till so much land a
[42:58.140 --> 43:00.900]  certain percentage had to be given to the government this is what we're going
[43:00.900 --> 43:05.380]  into but they don't even want you producing they want big mega agribusiness
[43:05.380 --> 43:10.900]  producing GMO crops that are deadly on record and not letting you the feds are
[43:10.900 --> 43:16.740]  now announcing even have it labeled that it's non GMO GMO pig that's got
[43:16.740 --> 43:21.620]  insect genes you're not allowed to know already on store shelves GMO salmon
[43:21.620 --> 43:27.580]  insect genes twice as big as regular salmon a chimeric clone not allowed to
[43:27.580 --> 43:35.940]  know they're now even moving to not make the food manufacturers tell you if
[43:35.940 --> 43:39.140]  there's corn syrup in it oh when you weren't paying attention to what corn
[43:39.140 --> 43:42.300]  syrup and aspartame was doing to you then they could put it on the label now
[43:42.300 --> 43:46.940]  you know now you've put on the they live sunglasses ever seen that movie put the
[43:46.940 --> 43:51.140]  sunglasses on you see the real world now that more and more of us can see and
[43:51.140 --> 43:55.020]  people are only seeing most people that wake up can now now only realize they
[43:55.020 --> 43:58.500]  have eyes that they can research that there's an agenda they can only see a
[43:58.500 --> 44:02.220]  few feet in front of them but as you research suddenly you can see a hundred
[44:02.220 --> 44:06.380]  feet then you can see a half mile then you can see a mile then you can see a
[44:06.380 --> 44:10.260]  hundred miles then a thousand miles then you can see things over the horizon
[44:10.260 --> 44:15.300]  before it even happens the human mind's incredible and the globalists know that
[44:15.300 --> 44:18.220]  that's why they're drugging the food they're drugging the water look at this
[44:18.220 --> 44:27.100]  news right here well let me give you the number it's 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231
[44:27.100 --> 44:33.020]  franken food coming soon to a store near you before it was just that's Fox News
[44:33.020 --> 44:36.900]  there were only eight major GMO crops that are the fillers in most processed
[44:36.900 --> 44:42.100]  foods and in every study just by accident of course the foods have added
[44:42.100 --> 44:48.660]  attributes that cause reduced fertility and organ failure every study just just
[44:48.660 --> 44:54.100]  just pull up GMO corn linked to organ failure GMO soybean linked to organ
[44:54.100 --> 44:58.780]  failure and then get ready to do some reading but it's easier just to say I'm
[44:58.780 --> 45:03.420]  making this up isn't it just easier you know they'll put a tax on salt or a tax
[45:03.420 --> 45:08.660]  on liquor or a tax on cigarettes or a tax on beef Europe's already starting that
[45:08.660 --> 45:13.340]  saying it's bad for you but then things we know are bad for you they're pushing
[45:13.340 --> 45:19.820]  on you and don't want you to know via the labeling franken food coming soon to a
[45:19.820 --> 45:23.620]  store near you watch for the new section frozen foods and organic in your
[45:23.620 --> 45:27.860]  supermarket genetically engineered that is if the government approves the so
[45:27.860 --> 45:32.940]  called franken foods for sale and you're not going to be allowed to know in fact
[45:32.940 --> 45:35.660]  this article doesn't have it in the headline when you pull up government
[45:35.660 --> 45:44.340]  is trying to block labeling for GMO I'm going to pull up believe it was AP the
[45:44.340 --> 45:47.580]  food and recommendation money began a two-day look at the issue Monday focusing
[45:47.580 --> 45:50.780]  on genetically modified salmon to be the first such food approved for human
[45:50.780 --> 45:56.780]  consumption that's not true clone and cross species pigs and beef both cows and
[45:56.780 --> 46:01.860]  pig are on shelves the agency has already said the salmon which grows twice as
[46:01.860 --> 46:07.100]  fast as conventional ones are safe to eat but salmon act as a genetic gatekeeper
[46:07.100 --> 46:10.420]  in this case approved them and open the door to a variety of other genetically
[46:10.420 --> 46:13.580]  engineered animals including environmentally friendly pig that's
[46:13.580 --> 46:17.140]  being developed in Canada and cattle that are resistant to mad cow disease so
[46:17.140 --> 46:20.020]  you can feed them rotten meat I was supposed to feed cows meat but they
[46:20.020 --> 46:24.140]  feed it to them then they grow pry on crystals and you eat it and we're now
[46:24.140 --> 46:28.340]  getting people 20 25 30 getting Alzheimer's it's really mad cow mad human
[46:28.340 --> 46:36.940]  and you're not allowed to know that but really Fox News is here saying that the
[46:36.940 --> 46:44.140]  salmon are safe they have insect genes in them you know that's funny I saw the
[46:44.140 --> 46:49.300]  university studies was in the Oregonian where they did a controlled test and
[46:49.300 --> 46:56.060]  found within 40 generations these fish will extinct natural salmon that's 40
[46:56.060 --> 47:00.900]  years in the open sea because they're twice as big twice as fast and are mean
[47:00.900 --> 47:09.100]  and attack the other salmon but hey let's release these in the ocean great
[47:09.100 --> 47:18.540]  idea great idea let's release these in the ocean here's another one government
[47:18.540 --> 47:24.020]  plan tax on sweets ice cream soft drinks see oh we're gonna tax you having
[47:24.020 --> 47:27.260]  some ice cream which you have eat too much of its bad and we're gonna track
[47:27.260 --> 47:30.660]  what you eat to be able to decide how much bad stuff you're allowed to eat and
[47:30.660 --> 47:34.740]  after a certain quota then we start taxing it which again is a tracking
[47:34.740 --> 47:38.380]  system of what you're eating when the school kids have been well trained at
[47:38.380 --> 47:41.980]  this all over Europe the United States most major school districts thumb scan
[47:41.980 --> 47:46.660]  even if you're paying cash to get food and it's putting a database oh and then
[47:46.660 --> 47:52.420]  if it's found your kid doesn't have enough money CPS is called manganese in
[47:52.420 --> 47:57.300]  the water tied to kids low IQ this is out of the CBC the major Canadian
[47:57.300 --> 48:03.060]  national television government television public television and funny
[48:03.060 --> 48:08.860]  why don't they run the reports that fluoridated water at one part per million
[48:08.860 --> 48:13.820]  depending on the study causes between a 10 and the lowest number in the
[48:13.820 --> 48:18.660]  studies and 20 point IQ reduction especially if children drink it it has a
[48:18.660 --> 48:23.500]  bigger effect in 0 to 5 year olds during neurological wiring and main
[48:23.500 --> 48:28.860]  development oh but they won't I mean you could pull up all those studies that
[48:28.860 --> 48:34.020]  that sodium fluoride reduces your IQ massively and is a cumulative bio
[48:34.020 --> 48:38.660]  accumulating poison and the EPA's on scientists have come out and called for
[48:38.660 --> 48:42.100]  to be pulled but who cares what they say manganese though they'll tell you
[48:42.100 --> 48:47.740]  about manganese an IQ comparison shows the Canadian regulations on manganese
[48:47.740 --> 48:51.220]  and drinking water should be updated to protect children Quebec researchers say
[48:51.220 --> 48:56.060]  an IQ comparison shows the Canadian regulations on manganese and drinking
[48:56.060 --> 48:58.900]  water should be updated to protect children Quebec researchers say the
[48:58.900 --> 49:03.340]  average IQ of children whose tap water is in the upper 20% of manganese
[49:03.340 --> 49:06.580]  concentration with six points below children whose water contain little or
[49:06.580 --> 49:14.180]  manganese research found and it goes on other studies show the same thing the
[49:14.180 --> 49:21.340]  IQ in every major fluoridated nation is conservatively 10 points under now and
[49:21.340 --> 49:25.620]  that mirrors the other studies about with with rodents and humans that it
[49:25.620 --> 49:31.580]  reduces IQ I mean they have been many famous studies where a major town next
[49:31.580 --> 49:36.620]  to a city that's fluoridated isn't fluoridated and their IQ is 10 point higher
[49:36.620 --> 49:41.260]  I mean you couldn't be doing something more brutal and then they add all the
[49:41.260 --> 49:44.660]  all the fluoride pills they give the kids in school and the fluoride gel
[49:44.660 --> 49:48.980]  treatments I mean you might as well I mean if you want that effect take your
[49:48.980 --> 49:51.900]  kid out back and beat him in the head with a with a sledgehammer I mean you'll
[49:51.900 --> 49:57.500]  get the same IQ reduction type I'm not saying do that I'm being sarcastic but
[49:57.500 --> 50:02.180]  here's the big secret did you know that in Europe in the United States and
[50:02.180 --> 50:06.580]  Canada that when you hear the word fluoride they are allowed to put over

[54:23.380 --> 54:27.620]  we're gonna start the next hour here in just a few minutes we're gonna go
[54:27.620 --> 54:35.260]  directly to Nick, Jenny, Gail, Maureen and others that are patiently holding the
[54:35.260 --> 54:41.340]  toll-free number to join us is 800 259 9231 but I wanted to spend a
[54:41.340 --> 54:47.740]  few minutes just boiling down a moment of clarity I had this morning and then I
[54:47.740 --> 54:51.980]  hope you'll think about and you know add your own thoughts to when we take your
[54:51.980 --> 55:03.140]  calls it's very simple and we talk a lot about this when a society has been
[55:03.140 --> 55:07.660]  wealthy and rich because we had liberty we go into that cycle that we've talked
[55:07.660 --> 55:12.340]  about for 15 years of becoming lackadaisical then corruption can take
[55:12.340 --> 55:21.980]  root people stand down and you get a collapse of society you go from liberty
[55:21.980 --> 55:26.020]  to plenty and then you become decadent and then corruption sets in and then
[55:26.020 --> 55:29.620]  tyranny comes and then society collapses and people fight for their freedoms
[55:29.620 --> 55:35.020]  again they appreciate the good things in life they appreciate freedom again and
[55:35.020 --> 55:40.140]  a enlightenment takes place now that's in some cases a lot of times cultures
[55:40.140 --> 55:46.500]  just never come out of tyranny like Mexico or North Korea or China a lot of
[55:46.500 --> 55:50.980]  times there isn't that rebirth and so really more and more I realize this is
[55:50.980 --> 55:55.700]  the realization as long as we have the remnant of those that understand the
[55:55.700 --> 56:01.940]  truth as long as we can grow our numbers when society does collapse we then
[56:01.940 --> 56:05.460]  have a better chance of fixing things it's going to collapse there's no
[56:05.460 --> 56:09.260]  stopping that now I just want to be honest with you that there's no way to
[56:09.260 --> 56:13.940]  stop it we have collapsed we are dead as a society a lot of you just don't know
[56:13.940 --> 56:17.380]  it yet just like we're in a depression according to every measurement but the
[56:17.380 --> 56:20.620]  government tells you that we're in a great economy and there's no recession
[56:20.620 --> 56:27.220]  for 15 months that ended in June of 2009 that's because a lot of the public
[56:27.220 --> 56:31.980]  still delusional and the government's talking to that group 35 percent or so
[56:31.980 --> 56:39.100]  that still believe anything I mean this is like Eskimos that you could sell ice
[56:39.100 --> 56:43.340]  cubes to they will buy anything of course the Eskimo really wouldn't buy ice
[56:43.340 --> 56:51.220]  cubes but that's how ignorant this is and the worst facet to all of this the
[56:51.220 --> 56:59.020]  really bad thing is that there's another big side effect to decadence it
[56:59.020 --> 57:01.860]  doesn't just bring you oppressive tyranny because people don't care and are
[57:01.860 --> 57:05.940]  laying around and don't have respect for themselves and aren't involved because
[57:05.940 --> 57:11.340]  they don't even have a gauge societally historically economically spiritually to
[57:11.340 --> 57:16.500]  oppose evil they don't have a rudder but the really dangerous side effect is
[57:16.500 --> 57:23.860]  this hyper decadence and you see this with ruling elites throughout history
[57:23.860 --> 57:29.180]  they become so corrupt they become so jaded that they get into more and more
[57:29.180 --> 57:37.340]  forms of decadence and sickness whether it's gladiatorial games or
[57:37.340 --> 57:43.300]  ritualistic murder or human sacrifice or wars for fun or out of control
[57:43.300 --> 57:49.020]  corruption all of that comes as a package but now the globalist have
[57:49.020 --> 57:54.020]  scientifically decided and they said this to make the public like them and the
[57:54.020 --> 57:59.300]  general population always mirrors the ruling class to some extent but now
[57:59.300 --> 58:05.500]  there's a form of synthetic tyranny and synthetic decadence where they want to
[58:05.500 --> 58:10.700]  make people hyper decadent and passive and drugged so that they get into their
[58:10.700 --> 58:14.860]  own destruction and actually hate themselves and those around them and
[58:14.860 --> 58:20.620]  actually enjoy the death and destruction and so after I take a bunch of calls I'm
[58:20.620 --> 58:26.100]  gonna try to flesh this out in a little more detail and quantify it but the
[58:26.100 --> 58:33.300]  globalists have grown giant hordes of sadomasochistic control freaks that are
[58:33.300 --> 58:38.220]  going to attempt a mass murder operation that'll make Hitler look like a
[58:38.220 --> 58:51.460]  piker you are listening to GCN visit GCN live calm today this is Alex Jones with
[58:51.460 --> 58:55.220]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[58:55.220 --> 58:58.980]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:58.980 --> 59:03.500]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[59:03.500 --> 59:07.740]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[59:07.740 --> 59:12.340]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.340 --> 59:16.300]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[59:16.300 --> 59:20.700]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[59:20.700 --> 59:24.420]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[59:24.420 --> 59:28.580]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[59:28.580 --> 59:32.380]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[59:32.380 --> 59:35.860]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[01:00:55.980 --> 01:01:02.900]  blank for yourself so that is something I'll still cover the farming situation

[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:25.820]  the next few days but she's still offered to come on again from the from the
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:28.500]  hospital but we're not gonna do that she's fine her husband got stung by a
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:32.580]  bunch of hornets he should be okay but I tell you I got a bunch of those outside
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:36.060]  my house every time I kill them they just come right back and they roost up in
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:40.620]  the cracks by the eve of our house and killed them repeatedly and they just keep
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:44.820]  on time my mom I went over to her house you've been stung by a hornet also a

[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:19.820]  and I was trying to get more of a part of the tea party movement out here and
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:26.300]  we so I did join a campaign recently an independent conservative out here in
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:29.500]  Illinois and I wanted to see if you could give us a little help in getting
[01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:37.260]  some exposure to him flesh that out a little bit what you were just saying I'm
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:41.180]  here with Robert Davis campaign he's an independent conservative out of
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:44.780]  Illinois and we need to get him a little exposure he's a writing candidate and I
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:49.740]  was wondering if I can talk a little bit about him and just plug his website

[01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:09.740]  candidates of their constitutionalist let's go ahead and talk to Denny in
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:13.260]  California Denny you're on the air
[01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:18.460]  hey Alex how's it going good I've been a huge fan since Endgame man I've been
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:23.180]  I've been really helping people tune into the truth man so I just want to put it
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:26.620]  out there that everybody has to do something creative do something get out
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:31.580]  there and make change because you tell the one person finds a way to get their
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:35.260]  message out there then you've done a good thing you know so
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:39.500]  my question for you is where can I find some where can I find anything really
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:43.580]  on their homosexuality and their child abuse
[01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:47.260]  I heard there was a book out where this woman like escaped the bohemian grove
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:51.660]  and she wrote like a tell-all tale but where can I find information on that
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:55.100]  well you can find it in the headlines all the time they constantly catch
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:59.580]  homeland security state directors federal sub directors
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:04.620]  actually raving children are trying to it's always coming out about large
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:08.940]  portions of cps workers truancy officers being into it
[01:04:08.940 --> 01:04:12.860]  it's not that the Boy Scouts are bad it's that predators try to go
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:16.300]  get near children I mean where are great white sharks off the coast of San
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:19.420]  Diego they're where the seals are swimming
[01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:23.260]  well child predators are going where the children are
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:27.020]  and so the real criminals they call them high level
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:30.460]  you know high IQ criminals whether they're
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:35.660]  psychopathic killers bank fraud people pedophiles you name it they try to get a
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:38.540]  badge and a gun or they try to get government power
[01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:42.300]  that's why tyranny tends to develop because bad people want to get into
[01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:45.420]  positions of government power to protect themselves so they can
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:50.380]  carry out their operations and so it's just all over the news
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:53.580]  that this is going on dying course been caught running giant child kidnapping
[01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.660]  rings and they're one of the main contractors in the
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:05:00.300]  us that also runs cps so I mean it's just it's everywhere

[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:24.540]  i want to break down the cycles that society goes through
[01:08:24.540 --> 01:08:28.140]  and i know we've been talking about this with red beckman and many others
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:32.700]  for 15 years but i wanted to really quantify it
[01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:37.660]  and talk about what it's going to be like to live under tyranny
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:42.860]  i mean we're already deep into it but it's got a lot more to go
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:47.420]  by many levels of bad from bad to worse so i'm going to be talking about that
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:52.300]  getting into the economy and a lot more uh let's go to uh gale in tennessee
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:57.500]  you're on the air gale hi alex hi hi the big news in tennessee i
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.820]  suppose you notice is urnist withers fbi informant
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:05.500]  and as a child during martin luther king's assassination
[01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:11.340]  growing up on images of i am a man it was a shock
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:16.540]  i have just even for a research that well i mean there's nothing to there's
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:21.660]  nothing to research but to fill folks in uh when we had dick gregory on
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:25.260]  last week he talked about how the tennessee papers had just broken the
[01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:29.020]  story at the long time photographer who took the famous photos of jesse
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:32.060]  jackson pointing from where the shot came from when it
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:35.340]  wasn't where the shot came from and you know basically none of them even
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:38.700]  dumped when martin luther king was shot which everybody thought was very
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:42.300]  suspicious and now it's admitted that he was an fbi
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:46.460]  informant tracking everything that king was doing
[01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:50.460]  and his friends who were also there were quoted as saying it was a good thing
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:53.020]  to do and dick gregory made the point that that
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.100]  sounds like they know it's about to come out
[01:09:55.100 --> 01:10:00.940]  that they were fbi uh informants uh and so uh since you mentioned that story i
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:03.900]  thought i would uh clarify for folks that didn't know what we were talking
[01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.780]  about gale right the commercial appeal broke the
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:12.220]  story uh but the reason i'm calling is i saw one of those weird crop duster planes
[01:10:12.220 --> 01:10:14.620]  in the middle of the night a couple of months ago
[01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:18.140]  and my kids were going oh it's mosquitoes they're spraying for mosquitoes
[01:10:18.140 --> 01:10:21.740]  and i've lived on this street all my life and it's always a truck
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.940]  so i thought it was strange it was 2 a.m and all these chemicals were being
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:28.860]  sprayed with infrared light and across the well that's the bigger issue is
[01:10:28.860 --> 01:10:32.700]  that they do this at 2 3 4 in the morning
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:35.980]  and i've told the story it must have been eight nine years ago i've i've been
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:40.060]  working late on a film got home about 2 30 a.m
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:43.820]  closed my car door and at about 300 feet a session flew over
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:47.340]  i could right over my house with the spray bottles under it
[01:10:47.340 --> 01:10:52.780]  spraying some type of chemical i mean it it hit me i mean i sat there like an
[01:10:52.780 --> 01:10:55.260]  idiot wondering what it was and then could smell it
[01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:58.140]  and then i went and searched the term and it turned out they were doing moth
[01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:01.900]  eradication but it turns out these chemicals are very toxic
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:05.500]  but but notice how the whole government does everything by stealth they lie to
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.460]  you and say the naked body scanners don't have radiation
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:12.300]  turns out it is dangerous can give you cancer they say they're not saving the
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:15.500]  images turns out they are and we're lying about it
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:19.660]  i mean they just lie as a course of action hey the asbestos hidden bad for
[01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:22.540]  you at ground zero don't wear a mask because if they
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:25.100]  told you to wear a mask you'd have to admit it was dangerous then they have to
[01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:28.940]  pay claims hey do you it and bad for your troops
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:33.420]  go ahead and use the pletiduranium hey core exit obama says it and bad for you
[01:11:33.420 --> 01:11:36.220]  there's no health problems in the gulf when that we know that's a lie
[01:11:36.220 --> 01:11:40.140]  and they're now spraying core exit at night to cover up
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:44.060]  and they lied and said 70 percent of the oil was cleaned
[01:11:44.060 --> 01:11:47.740]  turns out that's a lie almost everything they say is a lie
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:51.580]  anything else gail well i was just gonna be probably trying to make me
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:55.580]  sick so i want his health care which i don't because i stay healthy and i write
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:12:00.780]  a check when i get sick knock on wood but i don't want uh you know to be forced
[01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:04.220]  with his health care so well that's what the health care is about gail is is
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:08.140]  taking your choice away under these new rules that they're phasing in
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:11.420]  bioethics boards will decide what treatment you can get
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:16.700]  even if you have the money right right it's awful and um but i respect what
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:20.460]  you're doing and i just wanted to call in there's so many things to talk about
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:25.580]  and uh oh yeah the v a benefit my uncle who liberated buccan wall
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:30.700]  he's 88 he just got a bill three years ago the v a starting to bill him for
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:34.220]  medicine he was supposed to have benefits it's really weird
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:38.060]  i that they're all of a sudden giving him a three-year-old bill of some medicine
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.500]  i mean what i'm gonna talk about that in a moment but go back because i
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:45.820]  interrupted you go back to what type of plane was it how low was it
[01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:49.180]  what does you see it spring oh and the reason i was up is it was
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:52.700]  right after uh school and i have teenagers so i'm worried is the car
[01:12:52.700 --> 01:12:56.940]  coming home especially right so i'm not worrying about my teens being out
[01:12:56.940 --> 01:13:01.180]  so i was i mean i was up and i just looked out
[01:13:01.180 --> 01:13:05.420]  and i thought it was fairly low but what was strange was the infrared light
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:09.340]  because it was the same night of a big marijuana bus here in minstice and i've
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:12.780]  always heard that uh they always have this
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:16.700]  infrared technology where they're trying to find pot growers and all this so i
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:20.060]  figured oh that plane's looking for the guy that got away it was on the news he
[01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:23.740]  got away but then why do they have to spray i mean that
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:26.380]  doesn't match up so i thought well that couldn't have been that
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:30.700]  all right great infrared light great points i appreciate your call
[01:13:30.700 --> 01:13:34.700]  for those that just tuned in and and we're listening to her
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:39.420]  the problem with moth eradication beetle eradication you know these moths and
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:43.580]  beetles that really can't kill your trees is that a they keep it
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:47.180]  quasi-secret from the public they don't advertise it
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:50.860]  a lot of times people see this they complain they're told shut up conspiracy
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:54.380]  theorist later they learn it was true so they lie
[01:13:54.380 --> 01:13:57.420]  about it just like they lie and say there's no mercury in the shots then we
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:14:00.620]  prove there is they say okay mercury's good for you
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:04.860]  it's a culture of just lying automatically
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:09.580]  i mean we can't trust anything they do but then you've got the tens of thousands
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:13.820]  of declassified admissions and i covered just 20 or so of these in my film
[01:14:13.820 --> 01:14:18.300]  in game in one section where they've released bubonic plague
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:22.060]  in england in the u.s. they've released nerve gas
[01:14:22.060 --> 01:14:25.340]  in san francisco and new york and killed people
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.780]  and in all these cases they'll release bacteria you name it
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:33.500]  they'll have army doctors in civilian doctor
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:38.060]  you know white lab coats at the hospitals in deals with the hospitals
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:41.020]  to not tell the public they were just tested on
[01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:44.620]  so when they come in they can see what's happening
[01:14:44.620 --> 01:14:48.220]  and this goes back to the 40s our government didn't just go bad
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:52.380]  a few years ago of course it's all expanded
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:57.740]  now previously under the uh different laws they had on freedom of information
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:00.860]  act they would declassify this stuff 25 years after
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:04.780]  now they don't even declassify anything basically past the 90s
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:08.940]  but in some of the declassified examples this shows you what they think of the
[01:15:08.940 --> 01:15:12.060]  trips before i segue into what she brought up about her
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:20.460]  family being charged for for medical care of the world war two vet
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:25.580]  in in cases all over the united states at fort detrick mariland
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:30.140]  and at los alamos laboratories uh out west everywhere
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:35.100]  in one group of tests they did thousands of gi's
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:39.020]  and thousands of their wives and this is even in time magazine
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:42.540]  i think i saw it in time like 14 years ago that's how i first learned about
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:47.580]  that particular case and since i've seen it other places
[01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:51.180]  the woman would come in but they also to the men for other health issues
[01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:55.180]  they'd say honey i got some prenatal vitamins for you
[01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:58.700]  and they'd give them uranium or plutonium or some cases both
[01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:02.700]  in different tests pills when they were pregnant
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.980]  and then when the woman came russian in a day later they would be there and
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:10.140]  they'd even roll in film cameras and tape what they were doing
[01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:15.180]  to see what radiation did to a baby in the in utero
[01:16:15.180 --> 01:16:18.940]  and you know they told the scientists look if we if we hurt one woman if we
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:21.740]  kill one baby or we kill thousands that'll save
[01:16:21.740 --> 01:16:24.860]  millions when the russians nuke us meanwhile our own government had funded
[01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:28.940]  the russians that's now been declassified giving them all the weapons
[01:16:28.940 --> 01:16:33.260]  to create the enemy but it was really about creating
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:37.420]  cadres of doctors who would do anything it was about testing them
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:41.340]  to see if they had these legions of death these legions of doom
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:45.740]  that would carry anything and everything out whenever they were told to
[01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:49.980]  and so they'll send pilots up spraying stuff for moth or adification
[01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:53.260]  or they'll send them up spraying for marijuana fields or whatever but then
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:57.180]  one day they can put a biological on it they can release the flu
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:17:00.140]  and the pilot doesn't know they're compartmentalized
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:03.260]  or they can release a nerve gas they can release a deadly bio weapon
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:07.500]  you know that kills 99% of people that come in contact with it the human
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:10.060]  version of mousepox we know they've developed for this plan
[01:17:10.060 --> 01:17:13.660]  that's probably what they'll go with i mean if i had to pick one of the many
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:17.020]  super kill weapons they've got it'll kill 99% of you
[01:17:17.020 --> 01:17:20.140]  and they're really looking forward to releasing it and of course we've got
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:23.020]  all these top environmentalists people in the british government saying
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:27.020]  we need to attack our cities with bio weapons
[01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:30.460]  airborne Ebola and then you research them they
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:35.580]  almost all work in bio weapons boy you can't put two and two together there
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:38.860]  can you i know some of you can but i mean
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:42.860]  some people out there in such denial they can't even see what's going on here
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:45.980]  they want the world for themselves this is their big adventure
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:49.660]  their big decadent treat this is something naughty
[01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:52.140]  see that's what corruption does i'm gonna do it later but
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:55.660]  they just get into doing more and more crazy things that's the nature of
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:59.500]  humanity it's the nature of this cycle now
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:03.900]  if they would give a gi vitamins and telling they were vitamins when they
[01:18:03.900 --> 01:18:09.020]  were uranium or plutonium or strontium or some other isotope
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:13.660]  or if they'd nerve gas people in the new york subway in 1968
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:18.380]  what would they do to you now now remember last year i had the head of
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:21.500]  veterans of foreign wars on he was in the meeting with obama
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:24.300]  obama said i want to make a deal with you we'll get you more government funding
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:28.060]  if you do it to make all veterans including current
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:32.300]  veterans new veterans new wounded people
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:36.860]  pay for their own health care and he said no and he came on the show
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:39.980]  well just by stealth they already made the deal 11 years ago
[01:18:39.980 --> 01:18:43.420]  to take your death benefits when you die you've paid for that insurance over
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:46.700]  your life uh or to make vets pay for their own
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:49.100]  health care or make them pay for their own meals when they're at
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:53.180]  romstein with their legs blown off flown out of iraq
[01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:58.540]  again they don't like you they hate you and they get you all jazzed up about

[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:13.740]  through the uh reeducation system that we all live in

[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:23.100]  do to an old cannon they spike it what do they do an old battleship they cut it
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:25.740]  up or they take it off and sink it off the

[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:35.580]  interview she had come to the united states in 2000
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:38.620]  and says she had every intention of going back to kenya

[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:25.740]  gonna start getting into my little mini rant about the cycles that society goes
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:27.900]  through and really what we're facing you know 100
[01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:31.100]  percent what we're facing and everything that's happening all the
[01:25:31.100 --> 01:25:34.380]  craziness gone to seed corruption gone to seed
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:38.380]  is done by design to break your will so we're going to explain
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:43.100]  that coming up but right now let's go to koreen and then alonso jason hunter and
[01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:44.540]  brice i'll at least get to those calls
[01:25:44.540 --> 01:25:47.980]  for getting to those subjects uh let's talk to koreen
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:52.940]  uh in texas go ahead hello alex thank you so much for waking me up i tell
[01:25:52.940 --> 01:25:56.700]  everyone about your films and uh i think your your work is just great
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:26:01.020]  um i have three quick points uh oprah has just come out in support her book
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:04.300]  club is picked freedom a novel by
[01:26:04.300 --> 01:26:09.580]  jonathan freezing and uh this novel basically says that freedom is bad
[01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:12.860]  because if we're free then uh you know we're going to become a decade
[01:26:12.860 --> 01:26:17.100]  decadent society and you know that it's really bad yeah that's their answer
[01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:20.700]  see see they confuse the decadent cycle which
[01:26:20.700 --> 01:26:24.300]  they're all reporting on camille paglia you name it
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:28.620]  uh the the media then takes that information and confuses it
[01:26:28.620 --> 01:26:32.780]  that freedom causes the decadence in the evil no
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:36.620]  not respecting liberty and freedom and not defending it
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:41.420]  brings tyranny uh and so they're basically trying to scramble it
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:44.780]  and i mean look she funds a giant un brainwashing church
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:49.740]  in africa a lot of people like oprah whimphrey she supported barack obama
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:53.020]  unfortunately some talk show host here on jenesis did which was pretty shameful
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:57.020]  that we forget them for that a lot of bad decisions but i think
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:02.140]  that uh overall oprah whimphrey is super bad news
[01:27:02.140 --> 01:27:06.060]  and it's modern mind control go ahead well i used to like her and you really
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:09.660]  woke me up to her and and uh what i did what what i would like
[01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:14.140]  your listeners to consider is going to amazon and writing a one star
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:17.900]  review and putting in there something about you know freedom is what made this
[01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:21.420]  country great the constitution is what made this country great
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:26.620]  and uh if we all get a review it will just overwhelm her and now the decadent
[01:27:26.620 --> 01:27:30.060]  slobs tell us to capitulate to their tyranny
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:33.020]  because our freedom is bad my freedom to own a gun
[01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:37.740]  and not be afraid at night is evil my freedom to own property is bad no
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:42.140]  as the freedom is phased out we now get tyranny it's the opposite of what this
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:45.260]  writer's saying i haven't read the book but what you're saying is true
[01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:48.860]  yeah the book is called freedom a novel by jonathan frenzen i think we can
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:51.740]  really make a difference if you're listeners just go to amazon and write a
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:54.940]  review about it and say that we want freedom what else is there but
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:58.860]  you know he says we need a benevolent tyranny that's what all of the
[01:27:58.860 --> 01:28:02.140]  environmentalists are saying they're the high and mighty ones
[01:28:02.140 --> 01:28:06.220]  they say we've got to kill the majority of people i mean they're out in the open
[01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:10.940]  saying this and the public is so anesthetized with media and culture
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:15.180]  that they're just have no respect for themselves and aren't resisting it
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:19.340]  i'd also like your listeners to be really aware of how much subliminal
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:23.180]  messaging it happens on tv if you if you google the to the words
[01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:27.100]  opera deception you'll see very clearly at the white house interview with michelle
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:30.700]  obama they show a picture of obama made to look like
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:34.060]  lincoln now you may or may not like lincoln but many people think he's
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:37.500]  good and that is a powerful image in brave new
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:41.340]  world revisited page nine well that's not even subliminal i mean that's overt
[01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:45.180]  they take many different forms of propaganda and weave them together
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:49.180]  but the truth can cut right through it like a hot knife through butter
[01:28:49.180 --> 01:28:54.140]  yeah i mean it's but it actually is just a very brief flash on the uh on the
[01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:57.900]  screen and you know people they did these people aren't stupid they they know
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:00.540]  what works and they do it because it does work
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:05.260]  well oprah wimphrey has done a few good things like exposing mad cow and
[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:08.540]  things uh and then she's been kind of slapped around
[01:29:08.540 --> 01:29:12.700]  pat robertson had 30 plus different tv channels and they try to take his tax
[01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:16.300]  exemption in the mid 90s he suddenly flipped to being totally pro-world
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:19.900]  government not that he was perfect before that and so i don't like to just sit
[01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:25.180]  up here and judge oprah but uh
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:28.060]  i mean that whole world religion thinks he's pushing
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:32.060]  is super bad news i appreciate your call all right uh
[01:29:32.060 --> 01:29:37.420]  alonso jason hunter brice and others your calls are coming up straight ahead
[01:29:37.420 --> 01:29:41.180]  then i'm gonna get into a bunch of news and also talk about the cycles that we
[01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:44.700]  go through as a society it's very important because we
[01:29:44.700 --> 01:29:47.820]  are starting the accelerated downward descent
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:55.020]  into just hardcore despotism we're on the march the empires on the run

[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:53.420]  six million veterans are having their death benefits stolen when they die
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:57.580]  and it's in the news and it's the system says well they're gonna take that

[01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:14.300]  and they're gauging all of it and and it's not just going to stay at this one
[01:34:14.300 --> 01:34:16.860]  point of corruption it's going to get worse and worse i'm going to talk about
[01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:21.900]  that after calls but briefly here we've had a few
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:24.780]  specials in the last few months that have been extremely popular

[01:34:29.260 --> 01:34:32.060]  isn't a better tool to wake people up to the false
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:35.660]  left-right paradigm how obama was financed by wall street just like mccain
[01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:39.340]  that way they own both fighters in the fight all the horses in the race
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:43.260]  both sides of the football uh scrimmage line

[01:35:44.300 --> 01:35:48.780]  information can't wait watch this information now that special we offered
[01:35:48.780 --> 01:35:51.340]  that was the most popular we've done in a long time
[01:35:51.340 --> 01:35:57.580]  where you could get four films for 1995 the film that i think is my most
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:00.860]  important i mean obviously the obama deception has been the most effective
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:06.300]  but a film that i think was three hours long with expanded extras on top of it
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:09.740]  is in game blueprint for global enslavement on the back of the dvd it
[01:36:09.740 --> 01:36:13.260]  says they want you dead for the new world order the world government is just
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:16.620]  the beginning once in place they can engage their plan to exterminate 80
[01:36:16.620 --> 01:36:20.460]  percent of the world's population while enabling the elites to live forever
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:24.300]  that's what they believe not saying that's true they they say this
[01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:27.820]  with the aid of advanced technology for the first time crusading filmmaker
[01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:31.340]  alex jones reveals their secret plan for humanity's extermination
[01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:35.740]  operation in game and what is homeland security called the mass roundup plan
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:39.660]  that came out a year after this film was made operation in game
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:43.260]  and they've got a bunch of programs called in game they've got a eugenics program we
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:47.260]  discovered afterwards called in game i could just see what it was
[01:36:47.260 --> 01:36:54.700]  and the term in game four copies 1995 four copies you get it
[01:36:54.700 --> 01:36:58.620]  and give it to your friends and family air it on access tv make copies
[01:36:58.620 --> 01:37:02.300]  but people are more apt to watch it when it's a nice color cover with the back
[01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:06.780]  you know the nice dvd imprint on the top
[01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:11.420]  we're going to run this for two weeks or while supplies last it probably won't
[01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:13.500]  because then i've known i'm going to reprint them but
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:16.380]  when we start running low i'll have to pull it and it may be a week it may be
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:19.180]  two days i don't know because we don't have that many of these
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:23.900]  four copies 1995 and your purchase makes the radio broadcast

[01:39:57.100 --> 01:40:00.940]  hello alex hey buddy hey alex how you doing today man
[01:40:00.940 --> 01:40:06.380]  good good good uh i just want to make some comments and a couple points here
[01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:09.660]  um i don't know if you've noticed or any of the listeners noticed that the
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:14.460]  grocery stores all the grocery stores have little barcodes barcoded
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:19.900]  swiping cards that you get a discount with all that information is stored
[01:40:19.900 --> 01:40:25.260]  well i lost my card to get the discount and i went to the service counter
[01:40:25.260 --> 01:40:28.540]  to uh to get a new card and the girl that was helping me
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:32.140]  she laid the cards down right there that they're just kind of laying there
[01:40:32.140 --> 01:40:35.020]  pre-prepared you know that you'd tear them off and you use them
[01:40:35.020 --> 01:40:37.980]  and uh i just kind of tuck them and put them in my pocket
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:41.500]  then she turns around to get me an application for all my information to
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:45.820]  go with that card and i said no i'm not filling that out
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:50.380]  she she goes eight her manager comes over starts yelling at her
[01:40:50.380 --> 01:40:53.180]  why did you give in the cards without the information
[01:40:53.180 --> 01:40:56.300]  and i mean it was a big ordeal right there in the grocery store let me explain
[01:40:56.300 --> 01:41:00.540]  something there's nothing for free there's no free lunch when you're
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:04.300]  dealing with these people it's admitted with target
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:08.060]  and safeway and all these groups this has come out
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:12.140]  over a decade ago that they learn what you've gotta buy
[01:41:12.140 --> 01:41:17.260]  they learn what you'll absolutely pay for and they basically calculate it
[01:41:17.260 --> 01:41:21.100]  at the end of the day to charge you higher prices and
[01:41:21.100 --> 01:41:25.340]  then they sell the data and that's come out so absolutely
[01:41:25.340 --> 01:41:28.700]  and boy they'll really push you know i'll be at barns and noble
[01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:31.980]  buying some children's books or whatever and they'll push and push and push i
[01:41:31.980 --> 01:41:36.220]  even had a guy uh like a week ago go what's wrong alex big brother gonna
[01:41:36.220 --> 01:41:41.020]  get you and and and so these these slaves get
[01:41:41.020 --> 01:41:45.100]  into the enslavement it's like giggling fun for them
[01:41:45.100 --> 01:41:49.180]  and uh so so certainly they're training us to have to have a card it's also
[01:41:49.180 --> 01:41:53.740]  pavlovian psychological conditioning to swipe a card even
[01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:57.740]  if you pay cash to buy and sell they want to force you with the new national
[01:41:57.740 --> 01:42:00.780]  sales tax which they have neocons pushing they'll have that on top the
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:04.620]  income tax they won't get rid of it they won't get rid of one and add the new
[01:42:04.620 --> 01:42:07.820]  to track everything you buy sell and do oh you've had too much ice cream you've
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:11.900]  had too much beer now the tax kicks in or if it's a sales
[01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:15.420]  tax they'll have to know what graduated sales tax you're in
[01:42:15.420 --> 01:42:18.140]  when they're implementing it and this has all been announced i mean i knew
[01:42:18.140 --> 01:42:21.900]  about this many years ago now it's all happening
[01:42:21.900 --> 01:42:25.420]  absolutely and another another quick point i wanted to make to you i live in
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:29.900]  marieville tennessee which is the twin city to alcoa aluminum company of
[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:32.860]  america alcoa tennessee and that's where a lot of the sodium
[01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:37.420]  fluoride that goes in our water comes from hey man they're coming into our city
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:41.420]  limits all of any main road coming into our city limits of marieville and
[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:44.460]  there's this uh... government state looking sign that says
[01:42:44.460 --> 01:42:48.860]  fluoridated water i mean it's it's on every entrance of every city
[01:42:48.860 --> 01:42:51.820]  limit but it's because they care about your teeth not because it gives you a
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:55.180]  massive IQ reduction as they admit it's because they love you
[01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:58.860]  they care about you and that's why local
[01:42:58.860 --> 01:43:02.380]  i'm sorry there's a local doctor here in town that's been practicing family
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:07.020]  medicine for 50 years and he goes on the radio promoting fluoride good for you
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:11.020]  while i had him in my uh... i'm i'm talking to him he's a customer
[01:43:11.020 --> 01:43:15.100]  and we're talking about the the the fluoride and then i finally get him to
[01:43:15.100 --> 01:43:18.780]  admit to me that yes fluoride is arsenic okay
[01:43:18.780 --> 01:43:21.820]  yeah fluoride is poison he finally admits that to me so i tell the good
[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:25.660]  doctor i say okay i got some some some pure fresh filter drink of water back
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:29.580]  here doc and i'm just gonna put a little tiny bit of rat poison a little bit of
[01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:32.300]  strychnine in there i mean the parts for building you won't even notice it will
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:35.420]  you drink it well that's point why why would i
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:39.580]  and then he kind of stopped and thought about what he was saying
[01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:43.020]  i mean it's it's right there i mean it's good for your teeth it passes by the
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:46.140]  teeth it goes into the belly how's that helping the teeth jason i appreciate
[01:43:46.140 --> 01:43:54.140]  your call look do you drink sunscreen to not get a
[01:43:54.140 --> 01:44:01.660]  sunburn no you don't drink sunscreen to not get a sunburn
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:06.060]  you don't drink sunscreen to not get a sunburn very simple
[01:44:06.060 --> 01:44:10.300]  now the american dental association what now six years ago i kept saying five
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:14.220]  years ago but time flies said children under six
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:18.780]  should not ingest fluoride because it causes dental fluorosis
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:23.180]  it weakens your teeth it screws your teeth up but when you hear the term
[01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:26.460]  fluoride the reason that doctor was honest
[01:44:26.460 --> 01:44:32.140]  is there's hundreds of chemicals over 300 they can legally put in your water
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:37.500]  and call it fluoride so they take the aluminum smelting byproducts
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:42.940]  they take the from cracking the oil from from breaking it down from crude
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:50.060]  they use fluoride to do that deadly and they take the
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:55.180]  byproducts of fertilizer production and they put it your water
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:58.940]  and you can go read the list of this stuff but again it's insane get it out
[01:44:58.940 --> 01:45:00.940]  of our water you're not doing it to help us you're
[01:45:00.940 --> 01:45:04.140]  doing it to brain damages we have a criminal government
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:07.020]  and they're now out on the news saying we want to put lithium in your water to
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:09.820]  make you submit we want to give you a shot to make you
[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:15.180]  submit i mean they've gone from denying it to admitting it
[01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:18.220]  suddenly every day all over the news i covered it yesterday there's multiple
[01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:22.060]  headlines about eco fascism and how great tyranny is i mean
[01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:26.380]  they're not playing games folks that's why i get so frustrated
[01:45:26.380 --> 01:45:30.300]  this is all admitted uh let's go to a hunter in florida hunter you're on the
[01:45:30.300 --> 01:45:33.580]  year alex first thank you for being an integral
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:37.100]  part of waking me up and finding my purpose in life thank you very much
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:41.180]  prisonplanet.tv member thank you um
[01:45:41.180 --> 01:45:45.420]  first point actually i want to make is uh activism um i think if we all as
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:49.580]  sheeple for lack of a better term take one topic in our town
[01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:53.340]  with the abundance of people that are awake out there we can make a difference
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:56.860]  how i took my topic is i'm meeting with my city water director
[01:45:56.860 --> 01:46:00.540]  to have fluoride pulled out of our water it's a very simple topic if you get the
[01:46:00.540 --> 01:46:04.300]  right people you get in front of the the right people after i well you can also
[01:46:04.300 --> 01:46:08.700]  file suit and make them admit that there's hundreds of chemicals they're
[01:46:08.700 --> 01:46:12.300]  adding in the name of fluoride and bring into the lawsuit
[01:46:12.300 --> 01:46:16.540]  the union of epa scientists saying take it out
[01:46:16.540 --> 01:46:21.660]  multiple times in the last 11 years and i mean are they allowed to forcibly
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:25.500]  medicate you are they allowed to give you something that causes bone cancer
[01:46:25.500 --> 01:46:29.660]  again where are the ambulance chasing lawyers on this
[01:46:29.660 --> 01:46:33.900]  absolutely not that you know you go to drug.com it looks fluoride as a drug you
[01:46:33.900 --> 01:46:37.660]  know it should be induced and monitored and all this stuff and it's just it's
[01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:41.020]  absolutely asinine it's ridiculous the way this this process works well you
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:44.060]  know what he's going to tell you he's going to say it's state law which is
[01:46:44.060 --> 01:46:48.380]  really a mandate not even really a law that if they get their federal funds
[01:46:48.380 --> 01:46:51.660]  they've got to put it in the water and then you need to point out that's a
[01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:56.940]  regulation not a law and just start getting with people and never stop
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:47:01.180]  luckily i found out three years ago they pulled it out for budgetary reasons
[01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:07.100]  it's not state mandated luckily um and but funny enough uh who comes down from
[01:47:07.100 --> 01:47:11.100]  Tallahassee the entire dental lobby to make put it in front of the city
[01:47:11.100 --> 01:47:13.660]  commission that we need it back in and that's because they through the
[01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:16.540]  american dental association and the american medical association
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:19.740]  they tell those people what to do and these big businesses
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:23.740]  that are putting the poison in the water give money to these associations i
[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:29.420]  appreciate your call uh let's talk to brison texas briser on the year
[01:47:29.420 --> 01:47:33.740]  can you hear me yes i can hey man i'm glad to be talking with you today i've
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:36.700]  woken up over the past year by talking with some of my friends and
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:39.740]  mostly by watching your dvd and a few others
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:43.420]  and uh i got a couple questions for you i wanted to know
[01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:45.980]  you know i hear your show every day and i start listening to it and really
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:49.820]  thinking about it i wanted to know what is your plan for really changing the
[01:47:49.820 --> 01:47:53.100]  government and we talk about or you talk about all the different things that's
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:55.340]  going on and i understand it and i believe it
[01:47:55.340 --> 01:47:59.660]  and i see it with my own eyes but other than having some kind of a revolution
[01:47:59.660 --> 01:48:03.660]  how are you going to change it peacefully and the last question is
[01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:06.860]  have you thought about running for a public office with your knowledge and
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:11.420]  everything that you know i think that you could change things by doing that
[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:15.580]  well this is a very important call uh barice
[01:48:15.580 --> 01:48:18.380]  and i have answered this question many times but it always needs to be
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:24.140]  reiterated i am in the film that is basically a a
[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:27.900]  video version of richard max book where he talks about getting good
[01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:31.100]  sheriff selected getting good county commissioners good city council
[01:48:31.100 --> 01:48:36.620]  good legislatures we get 60 percent or higher turnout for a presidential run
[01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:40.940]  we get around on average 25 percent or so for an off-year election federally
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:44.460]  and we get about a little over eight percent turnout nationally
[01:48:44.460 --> 01:48:48.380]  in local races and travis county where i live
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:51.500]  it mirrors the national average a little over eight percent
[01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:54.780]  we are so focused on the big dog and pony show
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:59.100]  of the presidential election and so much money and time and energy gets spent on
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:02.940]  that when it's easy for the globalists to control the republican and democrat
[01:49:02.940 --> 01:49:06.300]  front runners that the media pushes in front of people and says
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:10.220]  these are your choices ignore all these other people in third parties or even
[01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:13.660]  in the republican or democrat like like ron paul is a republican who would
[01:49:13.660 --> 01:49:19.260]  have been a much better option so a the solution is nullification
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:23.660]  tent amendment that's one of the solutions uh it's it's it's also
[01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:27.180]  litigating for your rights and liberties it's saying no to the naked body
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:30.300]  scanners it's saying no to sodium fluoride in your water no
[01:49:30.300 --> 01:49:34.540]  with the purchases you make to fluoride toothpaste or gmo
[01:49:34.540 --> 01:49:37.500]  food that's why people won't buy the gmo food now
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:40.700]  so they're the feds are changing the rules to not say on the label
[01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:45.020]  that it's got gmo you've got to fight for that or at least encourage companies to
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:49.020]  put their own label that they're not gmo the feds have tried to block that
[01:49:49.020 --> 01:49:52.700]  they they want to not tell you on the mandatory label if it has gmo
[01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:56.780]  but they're also trying to block but they failed letting milk companies say
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:01.180]  no hormones no gmo hormones uh so
[01:50:01.180 --> 01:50:05.820]  so you fight with your pocketbook of the the votes you make with money
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:08.860]  you fight with your voice speaking out letting others know what's happening
[01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:12.860]  and forming others you fight by running for office yourself even if you lose
[01:50:12.860 --> 01:50:16.940]  you educate people at those forums at those debates at those events
[01:50:16.940 --> 01:50:20.220]  now when you talk about alex jones running for office
[01:50:20.220 --> 01:50:24.700]  it's never been about alex jones i can't save the world individually
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:29.100]  okay there's only one man that can do that and that's jesus christ
[01:50:29.100 --> 01:50:34.380]  so i can't do that but an idea no army can stop an idea whose time has come
[01:50:34.380 --> 01:50:37.500]  and so i'm doing the best i can with the radio show
[01:50:37.500 --> 01:50:40.860]  did i mean did you know under FCC rules i can't have a radio show if i run for
[01:50:40.860 --> 01:50:43.820]  political office there's a lot of and plus i don't want to run
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:47.020]  you know the way the campaign laws are written that it's impossible to run a
[01:50:47.020 --> 01:50:49.180]  campaign and not be put in jail if you're real
[01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:52.140]  but then the crooks in government they get to violate all the rules
[01:50:52.140 --> 01:50:56.940]  look all of us need to move forward against the globalist they can't stop us
[01:50:56.940 --> 01:51:01.260]  all it's easy to kill alex jones we'll be right back

[01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:03.180]  folks that are concerned about this new legislation they're trying to pass
[01:55:03.180 --> 01:55:07.580]  uh to basically not let you can strawberries or do any type of
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:10.860]  preparation of food and then sell it or even give it away
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:17.420]  which will just wipe out uh so much of our farming and ranching
[01:55:17.420 --> 01:55:20.700]  and shut down some of the few little profit areas
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:25.260]  that small family farms and ranches have left in this country
[01:55:25.260 --> 01:55:30.140]  so that is coming up but right now let's continue with your phone calls
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:34.060]  let's talk to chris and south dakota chris you're on the air
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:38.380]  yes sir um first of all i'd like to thank you for all that you do
[01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:42.780]  um i guess being what you just said i have a lot of things i could talk to
[01:55:42.780 --> 01:55:46.380]  you about but right now i'm gonna discuss what you i heard what you said
[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:50.460]  earlier about mad cow disease and it sounds like you believe the government
[01:55:50.460 --> 01:55:54.140]  lying on the cause of mad cow disease and i'd like to explain some things to you
[01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:59.420]  if i could go ahead um prior to the outbreak of mad
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:03.020]  cow disease in great britain the british government mandated
[01:56:03.020 --> 01:56:07.580]  the use of a high level of organo phosphate to kill
[01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:14.460]  the warble flies um subsequently then they came down to the cattle came down
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:18.060]  with mad cow disease now there was a government uh
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:22.460]  a british farmer who was also a scientist that saw some abnormalities
[01:56:22.460 --> 01:56:26.700]  and he did some research and what he found was that the cattle that did not
[01:56:26.700 --> 01:56:30.540]  have the organo phosphate didn't come down with mad cow disease and tested
[01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:34.940]  negative for it he did a lot more research and his theory
[01:56:34.940 --> 01:56:38.220]  was that it was caused by the organo phosphate and
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:42.060]  other environmental environment let me say this i'm familiar with the
[01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:45.740]  large debate going on for 15 years or so
[01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:49.900]  about what really is causing mad cow disease but there are a lot of studies
[01:56:49.900 --> 01:56:54.300]  and it's as normal i mean it's a cocktail it's like vaccines can cause
[01:56:54.300 --> 01:56:58.140]  a wide range of neurological disorders it's the same issue
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:01.660]  with cows they call it awful as i'm sure you know
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:05.900]  they take dead cows pigs goats sheep they grind them up
[01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:09.580]  in these big slurry pools then they create
[01:57:09.580 --> 01:57:15.420]  a protein mash and basically then mix it into regular cattle feed
[01:57:15.420 --> 01:57:20.380]  cows are not meant to eat meat uh they are herbivores
[01:57:20.380 --> 01:57:23.100]  they're not omnivores they don't eat everything like a pig
[01:57:23.100 --> 01:57:27.100]  they're not carnivores like a bingle tiger or a lion
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:31.500]  they're not omnivores like a grizzly bear that eats you know plants and animal
[01:57:31.500 --> 01:57:38.140]  so i mean it's bad to feed uh i mean they've got a blood protein
[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:42.860]  that they feed to calves i mean this is crazy
[01:57:42.860 --> 01:57:46.700]  cows don't eat meat i mean you agree with that don't you
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:50.860]  well let me explain a little bit i'm gonna ask you again
[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:56.700]  do cows eat meat in in the wild no they do not and they do not in this
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:58:01.180]  country because it's been banned and and so they no longer do
[01:58:01.180 --> 01:58:05.900]  and they used to in years ago yes they they they uh it within feed would be
[01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:09.260]  meat and bone meal and and they did but they don't
[01:58:09.260 --> 01:58:14.380]  any more since mad cow disease it the whole government thing the
[01:58:14.380 --> 01:58:16.860]  government caused the mad cow disease outbreak in
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:20.940]  in great britain and they couldn't they were not going to accept responsibility
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:27.100]  so they had to come up with a a a line of bull that that uh
[01:58:27.100 --> 01:58:31.660]  the cause of it well you may be i mean you may be right i saw some evidence to
[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:34.060]  that point i was just mentioning that Oprah
[01:58:34.060 --> 01:58:37.260]  Winfrey uh talked about it i think that was my issue
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:42.140]  anything else well stay there stay there

[02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:35.100]  going to break down the cycle of human civilization briefly
[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:37.740]  and we're going to open the phones up after i finished up with these calls
[02:00:37.740 --> 02:00:41.260]  as each caller hangs up that's your chance to call in
[02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:44.780]  dealing with this legislation that could pass as early as
[02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:48.700]  this week we do have jones migiri the lawyer and farm owner
[02:00:48.700 --> 02:00:53.580]  is very outspoken and very well versed on this joining us thursday
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:57.740]  she had a family emergency and could have made it today but i just told her no
[02:00:57.740 --> 02:01:03.340]  you take care of that problem but i do want to go over farm
[02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:07.580]  situation a headline farmer consumer outcry helping to stop passage of
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:11.260]  draconian food safety bill but it still has a chance of passing but the good
[02:01:11.260 --> 02:01:15.580]  news is it's so draconian the fda food safety modernization act is in
[02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:18.940]  trouble but it'll just give you an idea of what these people are trying to do
[02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:23.500]  but just like the animal id premises id we stood up and fought that in the last
[02:01:23.500 --> 02:01:27.340]  seven years and now it's in deep trouble but they're coming back with it again
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:31.180]  they said okay we're going to back off but then they're coming back again
[02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:34.700]  the toll-free number for farmers ranchers and others to call in on
[02:01:34.700 --> 02:01:40.540]  is 1-800-259-9231 now going back to chris and south dakota who
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:44.620]  sounds like a farmer i am familiar with all the debates
[02:01:44.620 --> 02:01:48.780]  about feeding meat products to cows and not cause
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:53.580]  the prions or the prions to grow in the brain
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:58.300]  um and i know the british government in 2000 we got the intel 2001
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:02.060]  it came out did release the footmouth in a drill
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:05.020]  did use it to shut down a lot of farming and ranching
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:11.500]  agriculture in the uk and uh we know the british in 2003 tried to
[02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:15.580]  have a drill in texas four footmouth using the same
[02:02:15.580 --> 02:02:18.540]  equipment they just used to kill millions of cows and sheep
[02:02:18.540 --> 02:02:22.540]  but that got stopped and so yes i don't always trust their official stories
[02:02:22.540 --> 02:02:28.140]  i was just as an aside mentioning that i don't like Oprah Winfrey and her
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:32.460]  world government promotion but i said i guess you could say she did some good
[02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:35.180]  when she tried to you know at least talk about
[02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:39.580]  uh mad cow so that was just a side footnote i was just trying to be totally
[02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:42.540]  judgmental about her didn't mean to cause a whole
[02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:46.940]  discussion about this but uh go ahead and finish your points chris
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:50.620]  well um i was probably pretty well finished on that but
[02:02:50.620 --> 02:02:53.820]  we do rank in south go to my wife and i am family
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:59.980]  and uh i've been very involved in the fight against anti-is for four years
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:03.500]  now and actually i i know jude mcgary personally
[02:03:03.500 --> 02:03:07.020]  um and you're right they've they've renamed it
[02:03:07.020 --> 02:03:10.860]  now called animals these traceability they're they're gonna try to
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:13.900]  continue to do it and we need to continue to fight it
[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:17.980]  um and i mean i mean the news says we're not doing it but then the bureaucrats
[02:03:17.980 --> 02:03:21.580]  still show up on record and say you're gonna do this you're gonna get arrested
[02:03:21.580 --> 02:03:26.460]  but they also run stunts i've seen this in all major agriculture states
[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:30.940]  they will on purpose as a stunt normally do it to a girl because they like her to
[02:03:30.940 --> 02:03:34.940]  cry they'll give her the the blue ribbon for the best calf
[02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:38.780]  or the blue ribbon for the best pig the best hog and then
[02:03:38.780 --> 02:03:42.860]  give a tour on stage and then say wait a minute wait a minute we got something
[02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:45.980]  going on here now this shows how diabolical they are
[02:03:45.980 --> 02:03:49.900]  and they'll have a cop come up and say you're not allowed to have that
[02:03:49.900 --> 02:03:53.980]  your your your family farm is an animal id which isn't even a law
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:57.980]  and she will cry and they throw her out and then all the other families rush
[02:03:57.980 --> 02:04:02.620]  out and register so to be part of the school ag to be part of the fair
[02:04:02.620 --> 02:04:06.940]  they say you've got to do this i mean is that not diabolical
[02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:11.020]  well it is and it's it's just one example i mean in colorado they they forced
[02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:14.460]  everybody at the state fair to to register their premises
[02:04:14.460 --> 02:04:18.380]  and and who's going to tell their kid not to now there were two families that
[02:04:18.380 --> 02:04:21.820]  refused because they knew what it was going to do to their property
[02:04:21.820 --> 02:04:25.500]  but that's the kind of thing they do all along you know in 2006 oh yeah you wave
[02:04:25.500 --> 02:04:27.740]  your rights you wave your fourth amendment
[02:04:27.740 --> 02:04:31.900]  and now the game ward instead of harassing you uh is now going to be on

[02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:40.060]  uh no that'd be it all right well listen i'm getting into this subject now

[02:04:43.820 --> 02:04:47.420]  is there anything else you want to add well just that there's

[02:07:14.620 --> 02:07:18.860]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:07:18.860 --> 02:07:22.540]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[02:07:22.540 --> 02:07:26.940]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:07:26.940 --> 02:07:30.860]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:07:30.860 --> 02:07:34.460]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power
[02:07:34.460 --> 02:07:38.380]  from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides

[02:08:08.300 --> 02:08:15.420]  it's alex jones
[02:08:15.420 --> 02:08:21.820]  chris is a rancher in south dakota and i'm well read all these subjects what he's
[02:08:21.820 --> 02:08:25.820]  saying is spot on from my research he was trying to talk about the
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:29.580]  vertical integration that's technical jargon for
[02:08:29.580 --> 02:08:33.100]  getting rid of family farms and ranches the irs is now
[02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:37.740]  harassing farms and ranches saying if you're not profitable
[02:08:37.740 --> 02:08:41.260]  you're not even eligible to get small tax
[02:08:41.260 --> 02:08:45.900]  deductions then the states are trying to mirror that trying to pull people's
[02:08:45.900 --> 02:08:49.260]  agriculture exemption i mean if you own a 20
[02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:54.780]  acre tiny family farm almost always a fraction of what great grandma or
[02:08:54.780 --> 02:08:58.380]  granddaddy had but over the years granddaddy gets cancer you got to sell
[02:08:58.380 --> 02:09:01.420]  part of it to i mean everybody who's been rural
[02:09:01.420 --> 02:09:05.580]  and and has a rural family and a rural culture has been through this
[02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:08.860]  they've got family farms down to two acres now
[02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:12.860]  in many areas and now they're saying we're passing zoning countywide
[02:09:12.860 --> 02:09:15.740]  you got to pay a five thousand dollar a year
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:21.260]  a fee just to grow tomatoes in your backyard i mean it's really happening
[02:09:21.260 --> 02:09:25.980]  and it is so hardcore what they're doing
[02:09:25.980 --> 02:09:29.180]  uh so finish up your points chris because you got interrupted by the break
[02:09:29.180 --> 02:09:32.780]  then we're going to rush through these next uh a few calls
[02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:37.260]  then i'm going to get into uh the cycle we go through briefly and then we're
[02:09:37.260 --> 02:09:40.780]  going to go to farmers in uh arkansas and other states
[02:09:40.780 --> 02:09:44.140]  go ahead chris well thanks alex for keeping me on and i'll
[02:09:44.140 --> 02:09:48.700]  be trying to be quick they have almost complete control the poultry hog
[02:09:48.700 --> 02:09:53.500]  dairy sheep um industry the the cattle industry is the
[02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:56.700]  largest segment of of the agriculture in the united states
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:59.660]  and they're doing their darkness to get control of us
[02:09:59.660 --> 02:10:03.900]  and through any is the food safety bill the pressure on the people who had a
[02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:09.340]  grazing permit in federal lands when they get complete control of the food
[02:10:09.340 --> 02:10:13.020]  supply in this country is when they can take over
[02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:16.380]  what i have said for a long time is that people
[02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:19.820]  will give up their guns they will give up
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:23.740]  take shots they will do anything for local bread for their kids
[02:10:23.740 --> 02:10:28.620]  and what consumers in this country need to know is that they need to help us
[02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:33.420]  fight our fights in in these industries in these ag industries because
[02:10:33.420 --> 02:10:37.180]  if they don't we're so far outnumbered there's less than two percent of the
[02:10:37.180 --> 02:10:40.460]  american people are in the country raising
[02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:45.740]  grain and cattle and hogs and the consumers need to get behind us or else
[02:10:45.740 --> 02:10:48.380]  we're all going to go hungry and we're all going to be in trouble
[02:10:48.380 --> 02:10:51.340]  well god bless you chris what you're doing is
[02:10:51.340 --> 02:10:55.180]  a uh duty to the republic thomas jefferson
[02:10:55.180 --> 02:11:00.540]  200 plus years ago this was the most common thing he wrote about
[02:11:00.540 --> 02:11:04.860]  that we needed country gentlemen who were educated
[02:11:04.860 --> 02:11:08.940]  armed with firearms and armed with the truth
[02:11:08.940 --> 02:11:14.140]  and if we ever became a centralized society europe only had about 10 percent
[02:11:14.140 --> 02:11:17.580]  urban then and he talked about how that was being used
[02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:21.420]  to control people and how they formed paramilitary forces
[02:11:21.420 --> 02:11:25.420]  in the cities to go out and basically turn
[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:29.500]  the farming communities in europe into serfs and so the same battle they were
[02:11:29.500 --> 02:11:33.020]  fighting 200 plus years ago we're now fighting today and god
[02:11:33.020 --> 02:11:36.380]  bless you keep it up for those that don't know the numbers he just gave you
[02:11:36.380 --> 02:11:39.740]  are the precise numbers you can pull these up if you'd like
[02:11:39.740 --> 02:11:44.380]  just search the term uh you know number of americans their urban
[02:11:44.380 --> 02:11:50.460]  dwellers it's right at 90 percent are urban
[02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:57.420]  90 live in cities or suburbs and are not self-sufficient in any way
[02:11:57.420 --> 02:12:01.820]  they don't grow one tomato a year out on the back porch
[02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:08.220]  of the 10 roughly that are rural most of them work at the hardware store
[02:12:08.220 --> 02:12:11.980]  or the walmart or the prison or the power plant
[02:12:11.980 --> 02:12:18.140]  or the mine or at you know trimming yards or at the veterinary clinic whatever
[02:12:18.140 --> 02:12:21.660]  the case may be or at the floral shop whatever's
[02:12:21.660 --> 02:12:25.260]  in the little town or at the dry goods shop or the gun shop
[02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:28.940]  now most of those people love their family land
[02:12:28.940 --> 02:12:33.100]  almost all of them if you do the study or just travel to small town
[02:12:33.100 --> 02:12:36.380]  their families this is the same for england canada
[02:12:36.380 --> 02:12:40.700]  france it doesn't matter and they're under attack everywhere
[02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:46.380]  and when you study these areas they all most of them have their own little
[02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:50.940]  plot of vegetables they may can a little bit of it for friends and
[02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:54.940]  family almost as a ritual to keep the culture alive
[02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:58.620]  they may go out four or five days a year park on the side of the road
[02:12:58.620 --> 02:13:03.580]  sell jams sell carrots sell tomatoes sell watermelons whatever the case is you
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:07.900]  see it out there sell pecans sell plums sell
[02:13:07.900 --> 02:13:14.300]  apples it's all over under this bill if there is any
[02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:19.180]  preparation if you slice those peaches and put them in a can
[02:13:19.180 --> 02:13:22.860]  you can't do it and the way the legislation reads and i've gone over
[02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:27.260]  this judas coming on thursday to talk more about it
[02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:31.260]  that it also reads that there are inspections and fines and fees if you're
[02:13:31.260 --> 02:13:36.300]  growing anything for sale now this is another way to shut down the
[02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:40.300]  farms and ranches and make you pay through those fines and fees for more
[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:43.100]  bureaucrats now listen my family has been in freestone
[02:13:43.100 --> 02:13:47.180]  county on my dad's side since 1829 on multiple sides
[02:13:47.180 --> 02:13:50.780]  first big wave that came in we have mexican land grants
[02:13:50.780 --> 02:13:54.140]  we've got copies of it the old family bible falling apart
[02:13:54.140 --> 02:13:57.500]  uh you know where we bought for three cents an acre from the mexican
[02:13:57.500 --> 02:14:02.220]  government now we have a tiny piece of that property left
[02:14:02.220 --> 02:14:09.660]  compared to what we had okay and they want to get rid of that they
[02:14:09.660 --> 02:14:14.300]  want to drive people off of that land and let me tell you
[02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:16.780]  it's such a police state in freestone county
[02:14:16.780 --> 02:14:21.100]  that i am an amateur astronomer and back in college when i had more time
[02:14:21.100 --> 02:14:24.700]  i would whenever i'd go visit my grandma or i'd go out to east texas i'd take
[02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:28.860]  the telescope and i'd set it up in the front yard or i'd go out in the
[02:14:28.860 --> 02:14:31.820]  you know in the 200 acres that's in front of their house
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:35.340]  out there with the cows and i'd set it up and every
[02:14:35.340 --> 02:14:41.580]  time i did it the gate would get opened they drive under our property they
[02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:44.220]  shine lights in my face and they'd say i want to see if you
[02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:47.580]  got guns are you out here hunting this isn't a free country
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:52.300]  you can have the illegal alien barack obama's aunt on tv saying i came here
[02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:55.660]  illegally i'm on three forms of welfare
[02:14:55.660 --> 02:14:59.180]  and i deserve it and the police aren't going to touch her
[02:14:59.180 --> 02:15:05.340]  but i don't even and i shouldn't let them win
[02:15:05.340 --> 02:15:12.540]  a i'm too busy to go hunting but b every time i'm at our little deer camp
[02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:16.780]  about six acres into our own property
[02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:21.900]  we don't even have hunters on our land when i was a kid they did
[02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:27.740]  you know people that pay to lease it every time i go hunting
[02:15:27.740 --> 02:15:31.020]  the gate opens up lights drive up and arrogant
[02:15:31.020 --> 02:15:34.460]  bloated pieces of trash game wardens come up
[02:15:34.460 --> 02:15:38.220]  and you'll have a deer hanging up they don't care if you got the sticker
[02:15:38.220 --> 02:15:41.740]  they don't care if you have the tags they let you know you're scum
[02:15:41.740 --> 02:15:45.260]  now when i was a child it wasn't like that and it's like that everywhere this
[02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:48.380]  didn't land to the free home of the brave they're not looking for poachers
[02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:50.860]  folks they're there to let you know you're their slave
[02:15:50.860 --> 02:15:53.900]  and now they're training them to see what you're growing to see what you're
[02:15:53.900 --> 02:15:57.180]  doing and claiming they don't need warrants to come on your property
[02:15:57.180 --> 02:16:00.620]  and this goes back to robin hood 800 years ago
[02:16:00.620 --> 02:16:05.660]  this goes back to your family starving you get caught with a rabbit you killed
[02:16:05.660 --> 02:16:08.860]  to feed your wife and they would kill you
[02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:13.180]  they would kill you they would take you out tie you to a pole and slit your
[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:17.100]  throat was the main way they did it no judge no jury no nothing
[02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:22.460]  and that's how this works and now i don't even want to be around him
[02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:26.140]  i mean here's an example three years ago my great uncle since died of pancreatic
[02:16:26.140 --> 02:16:29.980]  cancer he had been radiated had part of his
[02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:33.900]  pancreas removed he wanted to go hunting one more time
[02:16:33.900 --> 02:16:36.940]  he thought he was going to die then he ended up dying last year
[02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:41.100]  my uncle lennard lennard jones great guy
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:46.140]  he is out there and i always love these reports like the cop broke the neck of
[02:16:46.140 --> 02:16:49.580]  this 84 year old vet and they're like he's a vet well you know they hate
[02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:54.460]  vets even more but he korean vet you know great guy
[02:16:54.460 --> 02:16:58.860]  he was sick and didn't want to drive the deer in to have it processed he didn't
[02:16:58.860 --> 02:17:02.940]  want to have to gut it himself so my uncle
[02:17:02.940 --> 02:17:06.940]  and my dad got in the car to drive it into town
[02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:11.340]  a county that my family literally found it you understand this is america
[02:17:11.340 --> 02:17:14.700]  they're driving into fairfield 10 miles away
[02:17:14.700 --> 02:17:21.020]  our properties closer to buffalo they drive in there
[02:17:21.020 --> 02:17:26.780]  and we i wasn't there my dad told me the story my uncle
[02:17:26.780 --> 02:17:30.540]  and the state police pull him over and this guy
[02:17:30.540 --> 02:17:33.900]  is got his hand on his gun he's yelling at my uncle
[02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:37.340]  uh he's and and he's and the deer has a tag on it and he says
[02:17:37.340 --> 02:17:40.060]  what do you mean you didn't kill this deer you're going to jail all these
[02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:43.180]  other state police show up you're not allowed to transport a deer
[02:17:43.180 --> 02:17:46.700]  that wasn't yours and they said well actually i'm a landowner and it's
[02:17:46.700 --> 02:17:50.060]  legal for a landowner to do it and they said shut up
[02:17:50.060 --> 02:17:54.620]  shut up i didn't i wasn't talking to you you know that
[02:17:54.620 --> 02:17:57.980]  routine where you're talking to somebody and you talk and i tell you be
[02:17:57.980 --> 02:18:02.620]  quiet shut up and then more police show up one actually had an IQ i guess he
[02:18:02.620 --> 02:18:05.260]  didn't drink enough fluoride when he was growing up he says no it's
[02:18:05.260 --> 02:18:09.740]  it's legal and that cop was like you're lucky i'll get you next time
[02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:14.220]  i mean this is what our country has turned into this is what our country is
[02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:20.140]  the government wants you to know that you're a slave
[02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:25.420]  they want you to know that that that you're being watched
[02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:28.540]  that's why they have that pennsylvania tv ad where it says tom
[02:18:28.540 --> 02:18:31.980]  nice house nice car what's not nice is you owe four thousand dollars
[02:18:31.980 --> 02:18:35.020]  in back taxes and it shows a satellite watching tom
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:38.460]  they want you to know they're watching you they want you to know
[02:18:38.460 --> 02:18:41.740]  and they're going to put you in jail with a million dollar fine that's the
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:47.820]  ap headline in fact a million dollar fine for garage sale search that term
[02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:51.740]  i want to show folks they want you to know that you
[02:18:51.740 --> 02:18:56.060]  are scum now the illegal aliens filling up the military
[02:18:56.060 --> 02:19:00.220]  driving down the wages voting to take your guns they're above the law
[02:19:00.220 --> 02:19:03.500]  i saw another case last week in austin where this illegal alien had run into
[02:19:03.500 --> 02:19:06.620]  people three times he finally killed somebody and they're not even knowing
[02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:10.380]  if they're going to charge him with with a manslaughter
[02:19:10.380 --> 02:19:13.980]  because you don't want to make them not feel welcome
[02:19:13.980 --> 02:19:18.860]  they're the red carpet that's why obama's hand she says hey
[02:19:18.860 --> 02:19:23.260]  you owe me three forms of welfare i'm an illegal alien you owe me citizenship
[02:19:23.260 --> 02:19:27.580]  give me the money give me that money right now
[02:19:27.580 --> 02:19:30.300]  but when they're done bringing this country down you think she's gonna get
[02:19:30.300 --> 02:19:34.140]  anything no she's gonna get nothing but see all these debts that are run up

[02:24:52.540 --> 02:24:56.060]  it deals with all these issues but i wanted to get into some other facets of
[02:24:56.060 --> 02:25:01.660]  it and we will but let's go to some uh farmer calls then we'll get to brian and
[02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:04.620]  jd for farmers to call in and talk about what they're
[02:25:04.620 --> 02:25:08.460]  dealing with or ranchers and this this legislation
[02:25:08.460 --> 02:25:12.380]  that is designed to shut down what's left of the family farm and ranch
[02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:17.020]  scott in arkansas you're on the air hi alex how you doing good
[02:25:17.020 --> 02:25:20.140]  uh here just about a year ago we bought some harrell own
[02:25:20.140 --> 02:25:25.020]  organic seed vault and we planted about a half an acre this year
[02:25:25.020 --> 02:25:28.940]  well about the beginning of august we had some mexican
[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:32.220]  citizens i guess here on work visas with spray
[02:25:32.220 --> 02:25:37.260]  containers on their backpacks spraying everybody's land around here including
[02:25:37.260 --> 02:25:39.900]  our garden yeah i know i knew where you were going let me tell you what's
[02:25:39.900 --> 02:25:42.780]  happening there at least with cases i've seen
[02:25:42.780 --> 02:25:46.860]  monsanto and how they get away with trespassing i don't know
[02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:50.860]  actually has planes in fact search this people won't believe it uh monsanto
[02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:55.740]  drops uh roundup bombs on crops they do it in europe canada and here all over
[02:25:55.740 --> 02:25:59.980]  the world uh india and they fly in with planes and drop a
[02:25:59.980 --> 02:26:03.980]  canister and if you know let's say it kills 300
[02:26:03.980 --> 02:26:07.740]  of your corn plants your soybean whatever it is
[02:26:07.740 --> 02:26:13.820]  if one plant lives they then sue you claiming that you had their genetics
[02:26:13.820 --> 02:26:17.180]  but what happens is they finally lost in court on this
[02:26:17.180 --> 02:26:21.580]  their seeds blow in their seeds contaminate yours and so if there's any
[02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:25.820]  of their genetics that plant lives and and and the roundup doesn't kill it
[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:29.420]  so they're killing your crops but the government says that's okay to test
[02:26:29.420 --> 02:26:32.060]  now is that what was happening with the illegals
[02:26:32.060 --> 02:26:37.740]  i don't know i'm not sure but uh it was uh company called progressive solutions
[02:26:37.740 --> 02:26:42.620]  contracted by carol electric corporation and they basically came in and
[02:26:42.620 --> 02:26:45.740]  sprayed lineage clear stand a court xrt
[02:26:45.740 --> 02:26:51.100]  tordon k and alligator 90 and clearly in the msds as it says
[02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:54.460]  do not spray around anywhere where there's water wells and
[02:26:54.460 --> 02:26:59.180]  and what's funny is just four to five maybe even a week after they sprayed
[02:26:59.180 --> 02:27:02.380]  everybody in our little farming community got sick
[02:27:02.380 --> 02:27:05.420]  well me and my wife started driving around to look at some of the other
[02:27:05.420 --> 02:27:09.500]  farms that were hit not one single cargill farm was hit
[02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:15.580]  not one not one all the little mom and pop farms around here in our community
[02:27:15.580 --> 02:27:20.620]  gardens are dead and according to the msds is on lineage clear stand it stays
[02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:23.900]  in the soil let me ask you a question i know this is going on
[02:27:23.900 --> 02:27:27.820]  and it's part of basically you know this larger plan
[02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:32.540]  to shut everything down why don't you post no trespassing and why don't you
[02:27:32.540 --> 02:27:38.060]  call the sheriff on this company we did they said that the the electric company
[02:27:38.060 --> 02:27:42.460]  owns the land near or around the power lines which of course
[02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:46.620]  where's land at that there's no power so they claim they have an access ride away
[02:27:46.620 --> 02:27:49.820]  that supersedes your property that's made up that's not true
[02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:53.980]  they may have it right underneath it but that's they're just claiming that
[02:27:53.980 --> 02:27:58.140]  well they got it they got us they got all the other farmers in our community and
[02:27:58.140 --> 02:28:01.260]  it's happening everywhere carol electric has power lines
[02:28:01.260 --> 02:28:08.060]  except these big agribusinesses uh the chicken places nothing there got sprayed
[02:28:08.060 --> 02:28:12.540]  uh which actually we are the home of the tyson chicken
[02:28:12.540 --> 02:28:16.620]  right here in northwest arkansas and none of their farms got sprayed
[02:28:16.620 --> 02:28:20.460]  none of the cargill farms got sprayed they just ignored all that
[02:28:20.460 --> 02:28:24.460]  but they hit every single mom and pop farm in this whole
[02:28:24.460 --> 02:28:28.460]  where well they train you they just come on your property they drop bombs on it
[02:28:28.460 --> 02:28:32.620]  uh guys i know you found an info wars article
[02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:35.980]  dealing with how they're using blackwater but i mean that this was all over

[02:28:55.900 --> 02:29:00.220]  something like that should pull it up for you but they have planes that fly over
[02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:03.900]  and and and drop canisters that kills your crop they go oh
[02:29:03.900 --> 02:29:07.820]  their crops dead they didn't steal from us meanwhile they release their genetic

[02:36:02.060 --> 02:36:05.660]  hi alex um earlier you mentioned that oprah winfrey
[02:36:05.660 --> 02:36:08.540]  did a good job bringing up the mad cow issue and i just want to speak to that
[02:36:08.540 --> 02:36:12.860]  and one other issue um basically i've been helping a gentleman from the united
[02:36:12.860 --> 02:36:18.300]  kingdom um work on mad cow stuff for seven years and he passed away in 2006
[02:36:18.300 --> 02:36:24.300]  his name was mark purdy p u r d e y and if i want anything from your listeners
[02:36:24.300 --> 02:36:27.900]  and yourself is i want you to read the book he wrote before he died
[02:36:27.900 --> 02:36:32.700]  the book is entitled animal farm and the farm is spelled p h a r m
[02:36:32.700 --> 02:36:35.820]  and if you care about the family farm and you care about straightening out this
[02:36:35.820 --> 02:36:39.820]  whole fiasco with uh with the scam that is b s e
[02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:44.060]  and mad cow disease i would encourage you to read that well man i didn't mean to
[02:36:44.060 --> 02:36:49.260]  cause a big long uh i was talking about oprah winfrey saying
[02:36:49.260 --> 02:36:52.220]  she set up some weird u n global government church
[02:36:52.220 --> 02:36:56.140]  she supported obama uh she's a globalist
[02:36:56.140 --> 02:36:59.820]  and then i said but i guess you know she meant to do well
[02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:03.980]  talking about mad cow and gotten some trouble uh so that was just a small
[02:37:03.980 --> 02:37:08.380]  footnote i know that there's a lot of debate about what really causes mad cow
[02:37:08.380 --> 02:37:11.740]  oh and whether she meant to do this or not is is then
[02:37:11.740 --> 02:37:15.500]  so much the issue and whether the the situation that took place in the u k
[02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:18.780]  was a uh uh you know an action by government
[02:37:18.780 --> 02:37:23.100]  flipping in toxins into a chemical that was used at that time on the cattle
[02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:27.580]  who knows what about monsanto up in canada we've had the farmers on it's
[02:37:27.580 --> 02:37:32.220]  been on the news there where monsanto comes on your crops and sprays them
[02:37:32.220 --> 02:37:37.180]  with roundup they trespass kill your crops to see if one plant is theirs
[02:37:37.180 --> 02:37:40.780]  and i have seen that around here we're cattle farmers we don't have a lot of
[02:37:40.780 --> 02:37:44.300]  crop land but what has happened in in alberta canada
[02:37:44.300 --> 02:37:47.660]  and uh if you want to ask who is my government i would say my government
[02:37:47.660 --> 02:37:51.420]  is a bunch of people sitting in the legislature that are owned by monsanto
[02:37:51.420 --> 02:37:54.140]  and owned by all these large corporations because they have been
[02:37:54.140 --> 02:37:58.220]  passing legislation in this province at a rate that is unheard of in the last
[02:37:58.220 --> 02:38:01.580]  five years and the legislation is being done
[02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:05.820]  to control the land to control the water and the best example is the alberta
[02:38:05.820 --> 02:38:08.780]  land stewardship act which passed a couple years ago
[02:38:08.780 --> 02:38:12.220]  now i have some excerpts from this act which demonstrate that
[02:38:12.220 --> 02:38:16.780]  the government believes that they can take actions that i'm going to quote
[02:38:16.780 --> 02:38:20.140]  here establishing supporting or facilitating funding and
[02:38:20.140 --> 02:38:23.900]  cost-sharing initiatives mechanism and instruments to support or enhance
[02:38:23.900 --> 02:38:27.020]  any or any one of more the following and these are
[02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:30.220]  conservation easements conservation directives uh
[02:38:30.220 --> 02:38:33.820]  other sorts of programs and then there's the protection conservation enhancement
[02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:37.260]  of the environment now under the definitions of this in the act
[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:40.540]  and the environment includes the air land and water and includes
[02:38:40.540 --> 02:38:45.900]  all layers of the atmosphere and all organic and inorganic matter including
[02:38:45.900 --> 02:38:49.580]  living organisms so this is taking over control the
[02:38:49.580 --> 02:38:52.860]  government has no right to control living organisms or in a you know it's
[02:38:52.860 --> 02:38:56.380]  crazy and as far as the layers of the atmosphere go
[02:38:56.380 --> 02:38:59.900]  we've been seeing the chem spraying for about two three years now where we
[02:38:59.900 --> 02:39:03.660]  didn't have it before now it's just unbelievable the
[02:39:03.660 --> 02:39:06.780]  weather pattern in alberta this year has been completely screwed up
[02:39:06.780 --> 02:39:10.860]  because the jet stream is off course and and that we're
[02:39:10.860 --> 02:39:14.300]  normally you know temperate land to dry land and we're we're just
[02:39:14.300 --> 02:39:18.780]  soaking all right good to hear from you kathy let's see of mike
[02:39:18.780 --> 02:39:24.060]  texas farmer is back mike you there hey alex i'm here yep alex i'm not sure
[02:39:24.060 --> 02:39:27.660]  if you're familiar with momet county new jersey but that's where some of the
[02:39:27.660 --> 02:39:31.580]  most important battles of the uh revolutionary war were fought
[02:39:31.580 --> 02:39:35.260]  some of those the farms and orchards that
[02:39:35.260 --> 02:39:39.260]  uh... are on that land right where the battles were were
[02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:43.020]  fought to uh... gain our independence
[02:39:43.020 --> 02:39:47.660]  from the tyrant george the third uh... those places
[02:39:47.660 --> 02:39:51.500]  are what made new jersey uh... you know to be called and be famous as the
[02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:55.660]  garden state and they're now and they're now annexing the farms to drill city
[02:39:55.660 --> 02:39:58.860]  water wells and basically just stealing their property
[02:39:58.860 --> 02:40:02.460]  exactly and when i talk to people out here in texas about the fact that i'm
[02:40:02.460 --> 02:40:06.140]  from new jersey and they said well we're we're to grow up by newark airport
[02:40:06.140 --> 02:40:09.260]  that's what people think new jersey was and i say no
[02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:12.380]  no they're beautiful farms all over the east coast
[02:40:12.380 --> 02:40:16.380]  yes and i said if you want to know what your state is going to look like
[02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:22.140]  if you let these globalists continue to uh push their agenda your state is
[02:40:22.140 --> 02:40:26.060]  going to look like agenda 21's stated program
[02:40:26.060 --> 02:40:30.140]  is to deindustrialize and then also not let you farm
[02:40:30.140 --> 02:40:33.020]  to force you into mass cities to control you
[02:40:33.020 --> 02:40:37.420]  it is the stated full spectrum dominance is to make you totally dependent on
[02:40:37.420 --> 02:40:39.580]  them it's stated
[02:40:39.580 --> 02:40:43.580]  alex you talk a lot about predictive programming movies what have you
[02:40:43.580 --> 02:40:46.860]  you read professor tolkien books a lot the lord of the rings
[02:40:46.860 --> 02:40:50.540]  what did they take out of those movies or what did they leave out on purpose
[02:40:50.540 --> 02:40:54.220]  the end of those books where all the sheriffs and everybody are trying to
[02:40:54.220 --> 02:40:57.340]  take control over uh... the shire and hobbiton
[02:40:57.340 --> 02:41:01.580]  professor tolkien knew that that's what the british government was all about
[02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:04.060]  and that's what was going to happen in society
[02:41:04.060 --> 02:41:07.260]  back then when did he write them in the in the 20s and the 30s
[02:41:07.260 --> 02:41:10.460]  he knew that that's what society was coming to
[02:41:10.460 --> 02:41:16.940]  when local uh tyrant uh control freaks we're going to take control over
[02:41:16.940 --> 02:41:20.300]  everything you couldn't grow anything you couldn't build anything on your own
[02:41:20.300 --> 02:41:23.900]  land you couldn't walk from town to town without your papers
[02:41:23.900 --> 02:41:28.780]  he knew he saw that that's what this society was turned into
[02:41:28.780 --> 02:41:33.580]  well said mike anything else no thanks alex for doing what you do i'm a
[02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:37.260]  brand new member of prison planet tv thank you sir we couldn't do it without
[02:41:37.260 --> 02:41:40.540]  you thank you so much we're about to move prison planet dot tv to even
[02:41:40.540 --> 02:41:43.260]  better bigger servers and are updating it
[02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:48.060]  thank you so much for your support um okay
[02:41:48.060 --> 02:41:52.140]  really what mike just said it what is the beginning of what i was going to say
[02:41:52.140 --> 02:41:56.060]  what we're going through now is a high tech version
[02:41:56.060 --> 02:42:00.220]  of everything our ancestors whether you're african japanese
[02:42:00.220 --> 02:42:06.060]  it doesn't matter we go through feudalism corrupt elites build castles
[02:42:06.060 --> 02:42:10.300]  hire strong men and then show up at your little town and say
[02:42:10.300 --> 02:42:13.900]  you're going to give me your women you're gonna you're gonna give me your
[02:42:13.900 --> 02:42:19.020]  young men to be my soldiers and you're gonna give me part of your food
[02:42:19.020 --> 02:42:24.060]  once they've got you to accept that in every case they then expand
[02:42:24.060 --> 02:42:27.980]  well now you're not allowed to grow food only my cousin is
[02:42:27.980 --> 02:42:31.580]  so the food prices go up now you've got to be my slave
[02:42:31.580 --> 02:42:36.060]  in my local factory and so humans do the same thing
[02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:40.140]  kind of like an oyster grows an oyster shell or a plant rows a certain way and
[02:42:40.140 --> 02:42:43.180]  turns towards the sun they call it a tropism
[02:42:43.180 --> 02:42:47.580]  it's it's ingrained and and so what happens is
[02:42:47.580 --> 02:42:52.300]  here's the big secret about society good people
[02:42:52.300 --> 02:42:56.620]  just want to be married have a good wife or husband wonderful children
[02:42:56.620 --> 02:43:00.060]  once your belly's full once you've got your little piece of land out in the
[02:43:00.060 --> 02:43:05.100]  sun you just want to be safe you just want to be left alone
[02:43:05.100 --> 02:43:08.780]  and so governments will stage terror attacks governments will stage crises
[02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:12.300]  in the name of keeping you safe in the name of taking care of you
[02:43:12.300 --> 02:43:18.380]  and bad people who always want more power who always want more control
[02:43:18.380 --> 02:43:23.420]  who like to do sneaky things who like to be back stabbing and manipulative
[02:43:23.420 --> 02:43:28.140]  they always get into control and then they start recruiting their buddies in
[02:43:28.140 --> 02:43:32.140]  and then more ruthless people beneath them stab them in the back to get into
[02:43:32.140 --> 02:43:35.100]  power and then more ruthless people beneath them stab
[02:43:35.100 --> 02:43:40.380]  them in the back to get into power and then it it's like a
[02:43:40.380 --> 02:43:47.020]  central feudal purification system like a race a survival of the most evil
[02:43:47.020 --> 02:43:51.980]  where there's always an acceleration into corruption
[02:43:51.980 --> 02:43:55.420]  now those corrupt people are always there in society
[02:43:55.420 --> 02:43:58.060]  and there's only been a few cases in history
[02:43:58.060 --> 02:44:02.540]  where an a a a a a true system an enlightened system
[02:44:02.540 --> 02:44:05.900]  where the good people understand these truths
[02:44:05.900 --> 02:44:09.900]  create a system of government to guard against big government
[02:44:09.900 --> 02:44:14.140]  to guard against corruption but you have to be informed
[02:44:14.140 --> 02:44:16.700]  you have to be virtuous you have to have an understanding
[02:44:16.700 --> 02:44:20.620]  you have to guard the jewel of liberty as if it's the most precious thing in the
[02:44:20.620 --> 02:44:24.860]  world as thomas jefferson said you've got to be armed
[02:44:24.860 --> 02:44:29.660]  an armed person is a free person a slave is always disarmed a prisoner in a
[02:44:29.660 --> 02:44:35.100]  prison is disarmed it's so elementary and it's a law
[02:44:35.100 --> 02:44:38.460]  that tyrants and corrupt groups always want more more more
[02:44:38.460 --> 02:44:41.500]  and always try to take over but they told the american people after world war
[02:44:41.500 --> 02:44:44.780]  two we're the good guys we can do no wrong
[02:44:44.780 --> 02:44:49.340]  we can you know do whatever we want the government's going to grow grow grow
[02:44:49.340 --> 02:44:53.420]  it's for your own good and they've gotten over half the population in some
[02:44:53.420 --> 02:44:57.340]  form or fashion dependent on them and now they're going into the full
[02:44:57.340 --> 02:45:00.700]  collapse system but the globalists have written countless books and white
[02:45:00.700 --> 02:45:03.420]  papers they know the natural collapse that tyranny
[02:45:03.420 --> 02:45:06.860]  causes that then normally shakes out the tyranny
[02:45:06.860 --> 02:45:10.380]  and people have a chance to restart sometimes it gets worse sometimes it
[02:45:10.380 --> 02:45:13.580]  gets better they openly say we're going to have a
[02:45:13.580 --> 02:45:18.860]  control collapse to make sure we stay on top and consolidate power
[02:45:18.860 --> 02:45:25.900]  and expand our power through that but if you look at
[02:45:25.900 --> 02:45:30.940]  eastern european rulers western european rulers meso american tribes if you
[02:45:30.940 --> 02:45:34.620]  look at asian rulers in any period of history going
[02:45:34.620 --> 02:45:41.020]  back six thousand plus years in every single case of recorded history
[02:45:41.020 --> 02:45:46.380]  countries nations nation states empires always go bad
[02:45:46.380 --> 02:45:51.100]  and there's always denial about it because by the time you've gone from
[02:45:51.100 --> 02:45:53.900]  liberty and freedom that creates incredible wealth
[02:45:53.900 --> 02:45:57.340]  then the next generation stops taking it as serious
[02:45:57.340 --> 02:46:01.980]  starts becoming decadent corrupt corrupt people move into positions of power
[02:46:01.980 --> 02:46:05.420]  they set precedence to get away with more and more corruption
[02:46:05.420 --> 02:46:08.300]  they recruit more of their people set new precedence
[02:46:08.300 --> 02:46:13.820]  until finally it's just accepted that the government and ruling corporate class
[02:46:13.820 --> 02:46:18.700]  can do whatever they want and if we look at the psychology you know i talk a
[02:46:18.700 --> 02:46:23.180]  lot about hitler stalin malpulpot killing tens of millions slaughtering
[02:46:23.180 --> 02:46:26.460]  murdering for no reason even when people were submitting
[02:46:26.460 --> 02:46:30.060]  to linen the nkvd would come back to him the internal
[02:46:30.060 --> 02:46:33.980]  secret police and say all right we've killed a half this town now we've
[02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:37.500]  we've done all this and they would say kill more well who do we kill
[02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:42.460]  kill randomly terrorize them i want more blood
[02:46:42.460 --> 02:46:48.220]  it's really just a sicko see people like ted bundy who are really smart become
[02:46:48.220 --> 02:46:51.660]  governors they become fox news host singing in
[02:46:51.660 --> 02:46:55.020]  host they become homeland security deputies
[02:46:55.020 --> 02:46:58.220]  because now they can get away with their evil they can make everything
[02:46:58.220 --> 02:47:01.340]  they're doing secret government becoming more secret corporations becoming
[02:47:01.340 --> 02:47:04.380]  more secret while they write unconstitutional laws to
[02:47:04.380 --> 02:47:07.740]  make everything we do public so they have that advantage of
[02:47:07.740 --> 02:47:14.140]  intelligence of armaments of propaganda of resources
[02:47:14.140 --> 02:47:18.860]  and so you look at every culture you might get a strong king who you know
[02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:21.420]  won through war and whatever and who wanted to build up as people and you'd
[02:47:21.420 --> 02:47:25.420]  have a cycle of the philosopher king sometimes and milk and honey
[02:47:25.420 --> 02:47:28.780]  but then their kid gets in they're corrupt and decadent then their kid gets
[02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:31.740]  in even worse and their cousin kills them this person's you know a
[02:47:31.740 --> 02:47:37.420]  schizophrenic lunatic and they just go hog wild
[02:47:37.420 --> 02:47:41.180]  nuts we have now reached that hog wild nuts area
[02:47:41.180 --> 02:47:45.740]  i mean go back four thousand years ago in the
[02:47:45.740 --> 02:47:49.100]  mayan kingdom in central america and southern north america
[02:47:49.100 --> 02:47:53.740]  they might do out of a city of tens of thousands of people
[02:47:53.740 --> 02:47:58.940]  a handful of sacrifices a year and that was the priest class
[02:47:58.940 --> 02:48:02.060]  training people give me something that's really worth something to you
[02:48:02.060 --> 02:48:04.940]  show you're under my mind control well if you'll give them your kids to have
[02:48:04.940 --> 02:48:07.500]  their heart cut out you're under mind control
[02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:12.380]  you fast forward a thousand years to where they were sacrificing so much
[02:48:12.380 --> 02:48:14.620]  their population their population was going down
[02:48:14.620 --> 02:48:18.860]  they had killed off all the other tribes around them
[02:48:18.860 --> 02:48:26.620]  because four elites it's not enough to have 20 mistresses
[02:48:26.620 --> 02:48:32.300]  what's taboo strangling a child after you torture them
[02:48:32.300 --> 02:48:36.540]  what's taboo burning down a city for fun what's taboo
[02:48:36.540 --> 02:48:42.220]  crucifying five thousand people because you feel like it roman legions
[02:48:42.220 --> 02:48:45.340]  and then they start competing with each other then they have cultures of
[02:48:45.340 --> 02:48:47.900]  extremism where the leaders have got to be more
[02:48:47.900 --> 02:48:50.940]  ruthless than their underlings or they'll lose the respect of their
[02:48:50.940 --> 02:48:55.260]  psychopathic servants that's how the psychopath psychology works
[02:48:55.260 --> 02:48:58.540]  then they begin brainwashing the general public to be like them
[02:48:58.540 --> 02:49:02.220]  so they're accepted of it they start having gladiatorial games
[02:49:02.220 --> 02:49:05.580]  with people killing each other so you'll cheer your neighbor being killed this
[02:49:05.580 --> 02:49:10.700]  week and nobody will stand up for you when you're being killed a month later
[02:49:10.700 --> 02:49:13.900]  so they've taken all of this the globalists understand it and they've
[02:49:13.900 --> 02:49:16.700]  institutionalized it and you've got the british and dutch
[02:49:16.700 --> 02:49:21.580]  royalty and the roth child royalty for any lack of a better term
[02:49:21.580 --> 02:49:25.820]  and the asian corrupt elites and the hispanic corrupt elites all of them are
[02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:28.940]  the same they are birds of a feather flying together
[02:49:28.940 --> 02:49:35.660]  they enjoy what they're doing and so to them it's beautiful
[02:49:35.660 --> 02:49:39.100]  death and destruction have you seen the most popular art it's not
[02:49:39.100 --> 02:49:47.580]  moneys it's not van Gogh's it's not Leonardo da Vinci uh it's
[02:49:47.580 --> 02:49:51.820]  not you know famous dutch painters no it's now
[02:49:51.820 --> 02:49:56.300]  25 million for a skull with maggots coming out of it
[02:49:56.300 --> 02:50:01.500]  it's 10 million for a baby you know with disemboweled in a tank of formaldehyde
[02:50:01.500 --> 02:50:06.060]  it's when you look at christie's auctions the wall street the elites
[02:50:06.060 --> 02:50:09.980]  schwarzenegger i've seen stuff he's purchased i mean it is
[02:50:09.980 --> 02:50:13.500]  dead children covered in maggots their most their favorite thing is dead

[02:50:15.820 --> 02:50:18.620]  his one of his favorite artists you can there's photos of him online going to
[02:50:18.620 --> 02:50:21.900]  germany to see the displays is like dead babies
[02:50:21.900 --> 02:50:25.980]  dead babies and nazi uniforms i mean folks
[02:50:25.980 --> 02:50:31.340]  because they've had it all and they got into darkness and it wasn't enough
[02:50:31.340 --> 02:50:35.900]  the studies show it's the same with porn you know you're 15 years old looking
[02:50:35.900 --> 02:50:38.220]  at playboy you're shocked and amazed by it
[02:50:38.220 --> 02:50:43.740]  now you look at it it does nothing for you and so what it does is it sears
[02:50:43.740 --> 02:50:48.380]  the nerve endings basically it turns it into where you're like just a zombie

[02:54:31.820 --> 02:54:36.140]  why does every tyranny start huge wars and start slaughtering people for no
[02:54:36.140 --> 02:54:40.460]  reason why do their armies dress in black why do they rape and kill women
[02:54:40.460 --> 02:54:44.620]  because they recruit evil people in and then they can never get enough evil
[02:54:44.620 --> 02:54:47.820]  people so they start selling torture is virtuous
[02:54:47.820 --> 02:54:52.620]  jack bower is a hero they start selling you that secret arrest is good that
[02:54:52.620 --> 02:54:56.620]  that that cutting corners is good and that's to get
[02:54:56.620 --> 02:55:00.860]  good people who they see as weak-minded to accept the wicked paradigm is
[02:55:00.860 --> 02:55:04.540]  something that's good and there's no doubt that we're going
[02:55:04.540 --> 02:55:09.020]  into the worst of tyrannies there is no doubt that the corruption is even
[02:55:09.020 --> 02:55:11.420]  worse than i could even imagine every day
[02:55:11.420 --> 02:55:16.220]  they scale new heights or depths of depravity
[02:55:16.220 --> 02:55:20.780]  and none of us are safe and we better understand that and get that through
[02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:23.420]  ahead and if you are a person who loves liberty and truth
[02:55:23.420 --> 02:55:26.060]  and if you're someone who can see through all this and understand what's
[02:55:26.060 --> 02:55:29.420]  going on i mean you don't have to see through it now it's out in the open
[02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:32.620]  then you better do everything you can in small waves every day
[02:55:32.620 --> 02:55:35.820]  to alert people to what's happening and to stand up to corruption
[02:55:35.820 --> 02:55:38.700]  because they've tried to break our will break our back where we just kind of
[02:55:38.700 --> 02:55:41.900]  yeah i know it's corrupt i'm done just leave me alone
[02:55:41.900 --> 02:55:45.260]  you can't do that you've got to face these bullies down
[02:55:45.260 --> 02:55:49.260]  you got to call them out for what they are they think we're so weak
[02:55:49.260 --> 02:55:52.540]  they're all over the news saying yes we want to kill most people
[02:55:52.540 --> 02:55:56.140]  yes we want to kill babies yes we want to cut your energy off
[02:55:56.140 --> 02:55:59.820]  yes we want to destroy your industry i mean they actually say this
[02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:04.300]  and then say they're good see first they teach us there's no right and wrong
[02:56:04.300 --> 02:56:08.060]  oh don't criticize the Aztec culture you know every culture is different oh
[02:56:08.060 --> 02:56:11.900]  really what was the nazi culture good obviously no
[02:56:11.900 --> 02:56:15.900]  they they take your capacity away or at least try to
[02:56:15.900 --> 02:56:19.340]  they try to put it into suspended animation where
[02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:22.700]  you can't make decisions about what's good or bad and then they start telling
[02:56:22.700 --> 02:56:25.900]  you what's good see you're not allowed to have a view
[02:56:25.900 --> 02:56:28.940]  they've got a view and they're going to cram it down your throat and arrogant
[02:56:28.940 --> 02:56:32.300]  over the top way they act like everything they're doing is good
[02:56:32.300 --> 02:56:35.900]  when it's obviously bad it's time to get in their face and let
[02:56:35.900 --> 02:56:39.980]  these scum know we're not backing down dale and indiana who's a farmer go
[02:56:39.980 --> 02:56:43.980]  ahead yes alex so long time listener first
[02:56:43.980 --> 02:56:48.380]  time caller here uh we had a situation developing in indiana
[02:56:48.380 --> 02:56:53.020]  in our county uh through the uh zoning board out here
[02:56:53.020 --> 02:56:56.140]  and uh there's a lot of zoning board was wanting to um
[02:56:56.140 --> 02:56:59.740]  limit how many times the landowner the farmer could uh
[02:56:59.740 --> 02:57:06.620]  subdivide his land sell a portion of it off and so yeah that's always done so
[02:57:06.620 --> 02:57:11.180]  you got to go buy off the politicians for a variance
[02:57:11.180 --> 02:57:16.700]  right well then uh there was about 60 landowners at the zoning board meeting
[02:57:16.700 --> 02:57:20.380]  and uh two gentlemen got up and spoke in opposition to it
[02:57:20.380 --> 02:57:24.300]  and then i raised my hand to got up and uh wouldn't address the
