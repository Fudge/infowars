[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  When I grow up I want to be a rock star!
[00:30.000 --> 00:39.000]  Now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:39.000 --> 01:06.000]  It's 35 days until the most historic election in world history. Referendum on nationalism versus globalism, human freedom and the Renaissance versus global technocracy and the New Dark Age.
[01:06.000 --> 01:17.000]  You know, I rarely drop the ball big time, but I have really really dropped the ball in a gigantic way.
[01:17.000 --> 01:28.000]  And I began to realize this over the weekend, so I did a lot of research. And by then a lot of other people had done research.
[01:28.000 --> 01:35.000]  And now we have all the documents, we have all the admissions, it's hiding in complete plain view.
[01:35.000 --> 01:43.000]  And I'll talk about how I dropped the ball and how important this ball dropping is. We pick it back up right now.
[01:43.000 --> 01:49.000]  The ball's been fumbled, but the other side hadn't got it yet. And we get this information out.
[01:49.000 --> 02:04.000]  No wonder they don't want info wars on any social media or able to share information virally, they think, during this period because they're going to make a bunch of dirty moves the next 35 days. You've already seen it.
[02:04.000 --> 02:22.000]  But the information we're going to cover when we come back is absolutely so stunning that I just cannot even believe it.
[02:22.000 --> 02:30.000]  And thank God Michael Savage began to point this out last Friday because I'd seen it.
[02:30.000 --> 02:39.000]  But for some reason I mainly focused on Ford's leftist background donating 10 times to Hillary, 60 times to other leftist.
[02:39.000 --> 02:52.000]  Our story didn't add up, how there's new process, how you're innocent until proven guilty, you know, stuff that goes back to the Magna Carta.
[02:52.000 --> 03:02.000]  But then I began to look at her CIA connections and it's not connections.
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  It's like saying a cow out in the field has connections to cows.
[03:08.000 --> 03:16.000]  Or Hitler had connections to the Nazis or Apple's logo looks like an apple.
[03:16.000 --> 03:33.000]  It's unbelievable and it's not just CIA. She co-authors top studies and is one of the head engineers in a giant mind control program that they admit is mind control at Stanford.
[03:33.000 --> 03:46.000]  And then her father, grandfather, brother, brother-in-law all work in the same group of CIA offices that produced the fake Russiagate dossier.
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  I mean, and then she's got the deep state lawyer of Andy McCabe sitting next to her.
[03:51.000 --> 03:58.000]  This is unbelievable that they would try something like this.
[03:58.000 --> 04:04.000]  So her specialty is implanting false memories.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  Oh, you're going to read the study with her name on it.
[04:09.000 --> 04:12.000]  God help us.
[04:12.000 --> 04:21.000]  You notice everybody accusing Cabinah or psychology professors or somebody, another professor that went to Yale saw him drunk once he claims.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[04:25.000 --> 04:30.000]  And these people are using psychological warfare against us against our families against everything.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  And they are the problem in this country.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  They are the would be ruling class.
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  They don't believe one lick of their liberal garbage.
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  It's all meant to sabotage this nation.
[04:42.000 --> 04:43.000]  Unbelievable.
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  We're going to break it all down on the other side.
[04:47.000 --> 04:48.000]  It is incredible.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  No matter how you're listening or watching, tell folks tune in now.
[04:52.000 --> 04:53.000]  We get this out.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  It is going to derail their operations big time.
[04:55.000 --> 05:24.000]  Stay with us.
[05:26.000 --> 05:33.000]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health and cognitive health,
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain cognitive function and more.
[05:38.000 --> 05:42.000]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas,
[05:42.000 --> 05:48.000]  we're giving you the benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified high quality krill oil concentrate
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  paired with our ultimate fish oil or used separately.
[05:51.000 --> 05:57.000]  It's time to see what krill oil can do for you with ultimate krill oil now available at infowarstore.com.
[06:21.000 --> 06:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Tuesday, the second day of October, 2018.
[06:40.000 --> 06:41.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[06:41.000 --> 06:48.000]  We are 35 days out from the midterms that are obviously much bigger than just the midterms.
[06:48.000 --> 06:56.000]  I'm going to dive straight into the Brett Kavanaugh fiasco.
[06:56.000 --> 07:09.000]  And I'm not going to get into the latest Georgetown professors saying that they want to kill Kavanaugh
[07:09.000 --> 07:15.000]  or attack Kavanaugh and have his testicles cut off.
[07:15.000 --> 07:22.000]  I'm going to get to that later on the fact that of course Georgetown would probably give this professor a medal
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.000]  or the fact that they're actually putting on the news anonymous letters sent to Congress
[07:28.000 --> 07:35.000]  saying Brett Kavanaugh and another man raped a woman in a car.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  Well, hell, on the show Homeland, a character they admit is supposedly Alex Jones,
[07:39.000 --> 07:43.000]  is a racist and tries to bomb the White House.
[07:43.000 --> 07:47.000]  People running to me on the street and they think I'm the homeland character.
[07:47.000 --> 07:51.000]  They actually are mad at me for the TV show on Showtime.
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  That's the mental illness.
[07:53.000 --> 07:55.000]  That's the mind control.
[07:55.000 --> 07:57.000]  No, I'm not going to get into that.
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  I'm not going to get into the end of innocent until proven guilty.
[08:00.000 --> 08:07.000]  I'm not going to get into all of the Hollywood harpies running around foaming at the mouth saying,
[08:07.000 --> 08:17.000]  believe women, all men are pigs, all men are monsters.
[08:17.000 --> 08:21.000]  This is all divide and conquer mind control.
[08:21.000 --> 08:30.000]  Oh, and surprise, surprise.
[08:30.000 --> 08:41.000]  When you research all this and you look deeply into it, hiding in plain view,
[08:41.000 --> 08:49.000]  the most incredible information is right there in front of us.
[08:49.000 --> 09:03.000]  And the fact that they would try something like this is the most outrageous crap I have ever seen, period.
[09:03.000 --> 09:05.000]  In fact, it's so stunning, I can't even be on air right now.
[09:05.000 --> 09:06.000]  I'm going to have to go off here.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  Seriously, I'm not doing this for dramatic purposes.
[09:08.000 --> 09:11.000]  I'm going to have to compose myself and be able to cover this.
[09:11.000 --> 09:14.000]  And I will need document shots when I do it.
[09:14.000 --> 09:19.000]  So, I am going to go off here at this point, and I'm going to come back in the next segment,
[09:19.000 --> 09:27.000]  and I'm going to do my very, very best to be on air, and I'm going to do my very, very best.
[09:27.000 --> 09:34.000]  I'm going to do my very, very best to cover this information here on air.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  And, you know, you talk about dropping the ball.
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  This has been hiding in plain view the entire time.
[09:43.000 --> 09:53.000]  And the fact that they would try something like this, it just shows how stupid they think we are.
[09:53.000 --> 10:00.000]  So, I'm going to start the next segment, and I'm going to get into this information.
[10:00.000 --> 10:08.000]  And then, I'm going to get into China's worst nightmare, our IMPACT 2020, the South China Sea Drill.
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.000]  I'm going to get into six-year-old school pupils write gay love letters to learn to accept diversity
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  as the sexualization and brutalization of children accelerates and intensifies.
[10:19.000 --> 10:26.000]  We're going to get into the NAFTA renegotiation and the surge in U.S. economy.
[10:26.000 --> 10:28.000]  We're going to look at so many angles.
[10:28.000 --> 10:37.000]  Also, Millie Weaver got footage last night that's going to be going up on infowars.com.
[10:37.000 --> 10:41.000]  Because that's part of our reporters sending in videos to us.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  It's putting it on infowars.com.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  I'm going to go make sure that happens.
[10:45.000 --> 10:52.000]  Of a man who lost some of his family to illegal aliens confronting a bunch of pro-illegal alien demonstrators
[10:52.000 --> 10:54.000]  who are out there protesting Trump.
[10:54.000 --> 11:01.000]  So, that's extremely powerful footage as well that we're going to be airing here today.
[11:01.000 --> 11:14.000]  And there's a lot more as well.
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.000]  I want to first get into this report by John Bowne.
[11:19.000 --> 11:24.000]  Antifa's new blend-in and attack strategy.
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.000]  Because this is the new public preparation they're making on Facebook and Twitter
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  with large organizations run by major professors,
[11:32.000 --> 11:37.000]  organizing the next phase, especially if they don't win the election,
[11:37.000 --> 11:44.000]  of going out and engaging in massive attacks like we saw on the congressional baseball team,
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  resulting in consciousness, police almost dying.
[11:47.000 --> 11:50.000]  The attacks you've seen on Rand Paul and many others, that's their plan.
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  So, here's the latest report up on infowars.com.
[11:53.000 --> 11:54.000]  So, you can share it.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  Antifa's new blend-in and attack strategy.
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  Alex Jones on Twitter posted this week what essentially is a video calling for people
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  to get their battle rifles ready against the media, saying it's time to act.
[12:07.000 --> 12:09.000]  It's got to be done now.
[12:09.000 --> 12:11.000]  Move criminally against people.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  Send a chill up my spine.
[12:13.000 --> 12:14.000]  How about yours?
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.000]  It did.
[12:15.000 --> 12:23.000]  I mean, there's a number of actions that we believe help a call to incitement to violence.
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.000]  And those are the things that we need to make sure that we're taking action on.
[12:27.000 --> 12:33.000]  California's omniscient social media royalty would protect us all from questioning the narrative.
[12:33.000 --> 12:37.000]  But when it comes to fueling the violence of the left, all bets are off.
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  Hey, quick little question for military-minded lefties.
[12:41.000 --> 12:48.000]  Should leftists train, organize in an insurgent focus where they blend into a civilian population
[12:48.000 --> 12:54.000]  for potential attacks or a more militia structure focused on holding, maintaining turf.
[12:54.000 --> 13:00.000]  He then suggests using concealable weapons as Antifa blends into the general populace
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  in order to do more covert damage.
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.000]  From the guillotine podcast, which has 250 Patreon supporters and 15,000 Facebook followers,
[13:09.000 --> 13:16.000]  Dr. Bones openly calls for leftist terrorism to be waged against an innocent American citizenry,
[13:16.000 --> 13:22.000]  simply exercising their rights with the hopes of, as one responded to the Dr. Bones Twitter account
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  regarded as a big kill.
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.000]  Mike Adams warns conservative senators, Supreme Court justices, Unchanged left-planning kill team,
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  home invasions to execute you and your family.
[13:32.000 --> 13:33.000]  That's his headline.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  I'd make it even better.
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  Mike Adams isn't warning you.
[13:36.000 --> 13:42.000]  Mainstream leftist Democrat websites that Twitter allows to operate are openly planning.
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  Democrats publicly plan kill teams to kill Republican and conservative leaders.
[13:47.000 --> 13:48.000]  That's your real headline.
[13:48.000 --> 13:49.000]  With Mike's headline, it's great.
[13:49.000 --> 13:50.000]  I'm glad he wrote the article.
[13:50.000 --> 13:54.000]  I'm just saying, it's not him saying it.
[13:54.000 --> 13:55.000]  It's not him warning.
[13:55.000 --> 14:22.000]  They're the ones saying they're going to do it.
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  Yes, remember folks, it isn't just the health keepers.
[14:25.000 --> 14:31.000]  They are looking to train other groups, such as the Proud Boys and the Patriot Prayer,
[14:31.000 --> 14:36.000]  which they love so much, in military tactics, how to run neighborhood watches,
[14:36.000 --> 14:42.000]  which at least in Florida is code for keep black people out of our community with guns,
[14:42.000 --> 14:47.000]  how to run security, how to put down leftists.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  These people are training to kill you.
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.000]  You know, a lot of people say, oh, bones, you know, you're just being too, you're just too much.
[14:56.000 --> 15:01.000]  I don't know how more clear you want.
[15:01.000 --> 15:05.000]  The corporate globalist media is deliberately driving Americans into a bloody civil war
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  in a desperate attempt to destabilize the nation, invoke shooting on the streets,
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  and ultimately call for the United Nations peacekeeping troops that will depose President
[15:13.000 --> 15:18.000]  Trump under Strong Cities Initiative, and attempt to disarm the entire U.S. civilian population,
[15:18.000 --> 15:22.000]  for America, the people on 100 plus million firearms and have a Second Amendment right
[15:22.000 --> 15:25.000]  to defend their nation against foreign invaders, period.
[15:25.000 --> 15:31.000]  According to his website, Marxism and Satanism are synonymous with his openly violent rhetoric
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  calling for the slaughter of innocent Americans.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  Of course, this appears to be fine and dandy to the self-righteous tech gods in Silicon Valley,
[15:39.000 --> 15:47.000]  who are distracted by their laser focus on banning information that doesn't follow the Mockingbird media narrative.
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  John Bown reporting.
[16:17.000 --> 16:23.000]  We hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[16:27.000 --> 16:31.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.

[20:28.000 --> 20:43.000]  It's Alex Jones, live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide from the InfoWars.com studios.
[20:43.000 --> 20:48.000]  It is Tuesday, October 2, 2018.
[20:48.000 --> 20:53.000]  On Friday they're set to confirm Kavanaugh.
[20:53.000 --> 21:00.000]  The left, as they're known, really the deep state and the private intelligence agencies that have hijacked this country
[21:00.000 --> 21:12.000]  are going into complete and total terroristic overdrive to destroy, due process to destroy, basic freedoms that we hold near and dear like innocent until proven guilty.
[21:12.000 --> 21:20.000]  We have female professors, Hollywood stars everywhere saying kill Kavanaugh, cut his testicles off, all men are bad, especially white men.
[21:20.000 --> 21:23.000]  This is an attempt to divide and conquer this country.
[21:23.000 --> 21:31.000]  It's in the WikiLeaks, but more importantly it's in CIA, public manuals and others on how to control population.
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  Now get ready for this.
[21:33.000 --> 21:43.000]  I knew that Dr. Ford's, grandfather, father, brother and brother-in-law all worked high level CIA.
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  That had come out.
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  That's part of the course with these psychology professors.
[21:47.000 --> 21:53.000]  Then it came out that she ran recruiting programs at Stanford and one other college.
[21:53.000 --> 21:57.000]  She was involved in the recruiting.
[21:57.000 --> 22:02.000]  Then it got even worse.
[22:02.000 --> 22:12.000]  I saw a media matters article over the weekend attempting to debunk it and it went ahead and admitted it all and more and said, and how dare them.
[22:12.000 --> 22:17.000]  Yeah, she was in some programs to help people forget memories or have new false memories.
[22:17.000 --> 22:26.000]  There were several articles and I went and read the study she wrote and ladies and gentlemen.
[22:26.000 --> 22:39.000]  Turns out she coauthored and headed up major classic MK Ultra style mind control programs.
[22:39.000 --> 22:48.000]  We're talking erasing memories, implanting false memories, programming people openly at Stanford.
[22:48.000 --> 22:52.000]  I'm going to get into the actual program, show TV viewers the actual document.
[22:52.000 --> 22:55.000]  We posted it on infowars.com.
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  Mike Adams did an excellent job at naturalnews.com, breaking it down.
[22:58.000 --> 23:07.000]  But I read this last night when he sent it to me and got physically ill because I already knew all about this.
[23:07.000 --> 23:14.000]  And that's why when they have these big events, you've got to look and see are there leftist foundation groups involved because most of the time there are.
[23:14.000 --> 23:20.000]  And before I get into this, let me give you just a few things I pulled up during that four minute break.
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.000]  I thought let me give them some background first like I always do.
[23:23.000 --> 23:26.000]  Psychology today.
[23:26.000 --> 23:30.000]  Psychology today.
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.000]  Harvard's experiment on the Unabomber, class of 62.
[23:35.000 --> 23:49.000]  Theodore Kaczynski disappeared for three years into the MK Ultra secret assassination brainwashing program.
[23:49.000 --> 23:53.000]  You can go read it out of psychology today, LA Times, you name it.
[23:53.000 --> 23:56.000]  This all broke back in the 90s.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  That's psychology today.
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  Let me give you another one.
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  Shooter James Holmes and DARPA, Weird Science.
[24:03.000 --> 24:08.000]  Kurt Nimmer wrote about it and it links to mainstream news articles in fullwars.com.
[24:08.000 --> 24:18.000]  His father is Lieutenant Colonel Robert Holmes, the head of the Space Command NASA Army Language School Defense Language Institute.
[24:18.000 --> 24:21.000]  All of it.
[24:21.000 --> 24:32.000]  Complete and total interface with computers plugged directly into your brain for mind control.
[24:32.000 --> 24:35.000]  I'm going to keep going.
[24:35.000 --> 24:45.000]  Guess who Timothy McVeigh's doctor was until the day he was executed at Terre Haute, Indiana?
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  Yes, Jolly and West.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  Do you know who Jolly and West was on record?
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.000]  Number two scientist in MK Ultra and MK Naomi and other secret NASA programs.
[24:56.000 --> 24:59.000]  But wait, it gets more powerful.
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  He headed up an even more secret program.
[25:01.000 --> 25:07.000]  The name was never discovered in Canada with over 10,000 kidnapped children.
[25:07.000 --> 25:10.000]  Even the history channel has shows about it.
[25:10.000 --> 25:22.000]  He worked for Dr. Ewing Cameron, the former head of all mind control operations for the Central Intelligence Agency.
[25:22.000 --> 25:30.000]  And then you've got Dr. Ford, who remembers being raped by Brett Kavanaugh.
[25:30.000 --> 25:35.000]  How in the hell is this not a giant issue?
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  Now, we're going to get into her papers and her program.
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  And it is the most hardcore public mind control I've ever heard of.
[25:46.000 --> 25:49.000]  I know a lot of it's going on at the University of Texas Psychology Department.
[25:49.000 --> 25:55.000]  I was led in there almost 20 years ago by one of the folks that then moved on to an even more prestigious institution.
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  And I've told you about some of that.
[25:57.000 --> 26:03.000]  But it was mainly how to use flicker rates and manipulate people and make them sexually stimulated or make them nauseated.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  It was just using television to manipulate you.
[26:05.000 --> 26:08.000]  Some of the areas I was shown all DARPA funded.
[26:08.000 --> 26:14.000]  Every laboratory had DARPA on the door saying they were the ones funding it.
[26:14.000 --> 26:20.000]  So I just showed you mainstream news, you name it, admitting all this.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  For your TV viewers, you saw it all on screen.
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  This isn't even hidden.
[26:27.000 --> 26:30.000]  But what's incredible is that I dropped the ball.
[26:30.000 --> 26:35.000]  Because I was focusing on her working for RU486 company.
[26:35.000 --> 26:41.000]  I was focusing on her not finishing her residency, which is classic,
[26:41.000 --> 26:44.000]  because you go right to work for the CIA, you usually don't.
[26:44.000 --> 26:48.000]  And then I was focusing on her, because that's your residency.
[26:48.000 --> 26:54.000]  And the way she changed her story a whole bunch.
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.000]  But then I read the CIA Honey Trap story that Savage was talking about from Zero Hedge.
[27:00.000 --> 27:08.000]  And it was all linked there with her family high level, tied into Russiagate, tied into everything.
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  And then I saw this last night.
[27:10.000 --> 27:16.000]  I already read some of the studies she'd written, but I found these when Mike Adams sent me the article.
[27:16.000 --> 27:17.000]  And I shacked her and read it.
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.000]  And I knew what I was looking at, because I'd read the declassified stuff in the 70s on MKNOMI.
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.000]  It was all that with her heading it up in plain view.
[27:29.000 --> 27:37.000]  The co-author of a mind control study to give people false memories or remove memories.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  That is what they're looking for.
[27:39.000 --> 27:51.000]  That's the holy grail with chemicals, electricity, you name it, and just mainlining it how great it is.
[27:51.000 --> 27:59.000]  I mean, this is unbelievable to project of inner voices through subaudible frequencies.
[27:59.000 --> 28:09.000]  I mean, this is like the encyclopedia, these programs and papers she wrote, of everything I've ever researched and known about in one class.
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  God, who knows what they're doing with all this stuff?
[28:11.000 --> 28:19.000]  And then this is the woman that's up on television that we cannot question, even though her story has completely scrambled and upside down.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  And she's got interns living at her house and all the rest of it.
[28:24.000 --> 28:25.000]  This is who they brought forward.
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.000]  And now the other women are saying, actually, I never saw a cabin on attack anybody.
[28:28.000 --> 28:30.000]  Oh, actually, he didn't attack anybody on a boat.
[28:30.000 --> 28:32.000]  Oh, actually, oh, don't worry.
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  We have new anonymous letters saying he raped a woman in a car.
[28:35.000 --> 28:38.000]  This is unbelievably transparent.
[28:38.000 --> 28:44.000]  And then she's got the deep state swamp top lawyer there right there.
[28:44.000 --> 28:46.000]  So we're going to look more into this when we come back.
[28:46.000 --> 28:51.000]  I have filed suit against PayPal. We'll let you know about that coming up as well.
[28:51.000 --> 28:52.000]  Exclusively here.
[28:52.000 --> 28:54.000]  Mark Rondaz is joining us so much straight ahead.
[28:54.000 --> 28:56.000]  Whatever you do, share the live links.
[28:56.000 --> 29:25.000]  Tell folks about level stations.
[29:26.000 --> 29:36.000]  Here that that's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[29:36.000 --> 29:40.000]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed this year.
[29:40.000 --> 29:43.000]  Resolve not to be the next victim of a break in.
[29:43.000 --> 29:50.000]  Go to fakeTV.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV even when you're miles away.
[29:50.000 --> 29:55.000]  Security is a mindset and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[29:55.000 --> 29:57.000]  Be vigilant but not fearful.

[30:00.000 --> 30:05.000]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[32:22.000 --> 32:32.000]  So we've already had incredible success, but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
[32:32.000 --> 32:43.000]  and if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, Infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[32:43.000 --> 32:53.000]  We have huge sales at InfowarsStore.com right now, and we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market.
[32:53.000 --> 33:00.000]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Sorrel's the glove we'll spend with. This is Infowars Darker Sour. We do your support. I'm counting on you.
[33:00.000 --> 33:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:30.000 --> 33:52.000]  Welcome back, Alex Jones here live. So we looked into Dr. Ford, the psychologist, background, and we looked at how she was a big Hillary supporter and gave 10 donations in the last cycle and 60 donations to other Democrats.
[33:52.000 --> 34:01.000]  She's got a lot of money. Now she's an executive with the RU-486 abortion pill company worth hundreds of billions of dollars sold out on the market.
[34:01.000 --> 34:21.000]  And we looked at how she was part of a whole manhating organization and how she supported by Sorrel's back groups and how her whole testimony kept contradicting itself and how whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty and why did they sit on the allegations until right before the vote, on and on and on.
[34:21.000 --> 34:40.000]  Instead of looking at what she did at Stanford and one other university, even currently what she does. And she is in a public mind control operation that implants false memories and removes memories.
[34:40.000 --> 34:55.000]  The story is on Infowars.com with all of the documents and we have saved and posted much of the actual reports so they can't remove them.
[34:55.000 --> 35:06.000]  Imagine why they want Infowars shut down and curtailed and censored it with just 35 days out because they want to launch stuff like this and get away with it.
[35:06.000 --> 35:12.000]  Do you think I just went on air and said that the Batman shooter in Aurora, Colorado was suspicious?
[35:12.000 --> 35:30.000]  It was on local news that his father was a military officer heading up a giant mind control operation and that the former head of the Air Force Psychiatry Division left a year before and came to be his private psychiatrist at the college.
[35:30.000 --> 35:45.000]  And then he then said in the jail, it was in the Denver news that I have been drugged. I am under mind control. I was not the shooter. There was another person there. His father heads up Air Force mind control.
[35:45.000 --> 35:57.000]  His psychiatrist is a woman that formerly headed up the Air Force. It's psychological operations. This is in the newspaper.
[35:57.000 --> 36:11.000]  I have the LA Times and Psychology Day right here where Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber, was in MKUltra for three years.
[36:11.000 --> 36:19.000]  Shooter James Holmes in DARPA Weird Science. Inmate James Holmes told me he was programmed to kill my evil therapist. I'm not saying she did that.
[36:19.000 --> 36:27.000]  I mean, she's just this top Air Force psychiatrist that happened to be his personal psychiatrist and just met with him at four times a week.
[36:27.000 --> 36:37.000]  Oh, and he was in a brain machine interface program himself. He was being paid $98,000 a year, by the way, by the Defense Department in DARPA.
[36:37.000 --> 36:45.000]  Oh, yeah, the shooter. Because, you know, Daddy was one of the top guys in the program. Well, he's getting 90 something thousand a year.
[36:45.000 --> 36:50.000]  And he goes and shoots up a movie theater. Hmm. The shadow Patsy rises again.
[36:50.000 --> 36:59.000]  How mind control is connected to gun control. Infowars.com. It's why they want to shut down the relationship between MKUltra and mass murder.
[36:59.000 --> 37:07.000]  Jamie White. Infowars.com February this year. Here we are on the one year anniversary now of the Vegas situation.
[37:07.000 --> 37:25.000]  Murder under hypnosis. The James Holmes story takes a familiar turn. And now we have a doctor whose grandfather, father, brother and brother-in-law all work high level CIA,
[37:25.000 --> 37:37.000]  NDC and the same programs. And some of them work inside Baker Hostetler that wrote up the original Piscate dossier. And none of this is suspicious to anybody.
[37:37.000 --> 37:51.000]  And then you read the report. Kavanaugh accuser Christine Blasey Ford ran mass hypnotic inductions. Did you hear that? Mass hypnotic inductions putting you into a hypnotic spell.
[37:51.000 --> 38:12.000]  That's, that's her words of psychiatric subjects as part of mind control research funded by the foundation link to computational psychomatics, psychosomatics, neuro hijacking, neuro hijacking.
[38:12.000 --> 38:24.000]  Nothing to see here. Nothing going on. Stunning bombshell about the hoax accusations against Brent Kavanaugh. And you hear her say how she remembered it a few years ago.
[38:24.000 --> 38:32.000]  And then told the therapist by name, but it's not in the notes. And then the dog was there at the window and she decided to go public. I mean, maybe she's under mind control. My God.
[38:32.000 --> 38:49.000]  Stunning bombshell about the hoax accusations against Brett Kavanaugh. We've now learned and confirmed that Christine Blasey Ford coauthored a science paper that involves her carrying out quote hypnotic inductions of psychiatric subjects as part of mind control program that
[38:49.000 --> 39:05.000]  cites methods to create artificial situations. Did you hear that? They put people in the trance is so deep that they are under total mind control and believe whatever they're told. Internet sluice are turning up extraordinary collection of evidence that
[39:05.000 --> 39:21.000]  increasingly points to Christine Blasey Ford being involved in mind control programs at Stanford writes Mike Adams, which some claim are run by the CIA. It's DARPA funding it. That's above the CIA. We have confirmed that Stanford University where Ford works runs a CIA
[39:21.000 --> 39:37.000]  undergraduate internship program, which is described in full at the Stanford dot edu recruitment page for the CIA. The Stanford recruitment page for the CIA explains you'll be given opportunity to work with highly skilled professionals and see firsthand the role the CIA plays in
[39:37.000 --> 39:55.000]  supporting us officials who make our country's foreign policy. We can and it goes on from there breaking the self hypnosis and create artificial situations paper that she coauthored Christine Blasey Ford's confirmed to be coauthor of the mind control
[39:55.000 --> 40:11.000]  study. The hypnotic induction system spiegel and spiegel to evaluate their level of hypnotizing and we're asked to and it goes all through it for the Stanford University School of Medicine to participate in it with the hypnotic inductions of the students.
[40:11.000 --> 40:31.000]  The Mental Insight Foundation also funded a study on interception and neuro imaging to control the mind through biological intervention. That means drugs, chemicals, radio waves, you name it and then guess what's right here. Boom.
[40:31.000 --> 40:43.000]  And it just gets crazier and crazier projections of inner voices through sub audible frequencies to plant voices and even emotional moods in the minds of targeted subjects. G wonder who wants that.
[40:43.000 --> 41:05.000]  And it goes on to what's happening in Cuba and China to our forces, you know, being hit with it. But then it gets even crazier. You got to go read this. It gets into the different waves to hit the heart, the amplitude to hit different organs to attack the stomach to attack the brain.
[41:05.000 --> 41:17.000]  And it talks about in this huge paper. Vegas nerve stimulation presentation of information during different phases of visceral rhythms and assessment.
[41:17.000 --> 41:22.000]  And it goes all three different ways like I told you to mind control you.
[41:22.000 --> 41:41.000]  Look at these documents changing the world through using these interactions using these waves using these outside systems combined percent of the body in the world.
[41:41.000 --> 41:52.000]  The outside perception and the inner perception changing the body through interactions with the body.
[41:52.000 --> 42:15.000]  The psychosomatics of the systems are using additional details about the mental insight foundation. They even call it computational psychosomatics. And they talk about using torture techniques, close quote, to force the neurological maps open into the open,
[42:15.000 --> 42:30.000]  saying the degree of tolerance to being enclosed in a small dark chamber for 10 minutes might provide behavioral evidence verifying tolerance in triggers for the mind control program.
[42:30.000 --> 42:38.000]  And that's what it is when they put you in a coffin and they do this during death education in the schools. Folks, I can hardly even read this. It's so stunning.
[42:38.000 --> 42:55.000]  This is just some of the papers. This is some of what we're dealing with. And of course, she is she is literally a mind control doctor in a giant CIA universally standard program for false memories now trying to destroy the Supreme Court nominee.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  My God, this is beyond two plus two week before.
[42:59.000 --> 43:12.000]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates. But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[43:12.000 --> 43:32.000]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[43:32.000 --> 43:48.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[43:48.000 --> 43:59.000]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[43:59.000 --> 44:10.000]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world. It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist.
[44:10.000 --> 44:19.000]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.
[44:19.000 --> 44:34.000]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word. You are the info ward. And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email.
[44:34.000 --> 44:48.000]  So there's no way the sensors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, Intel, you name it. And so now I ask you more than ever to share the infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people by the local stations you're listening to.
[44:48.000 --> 44:59.000]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at infowars.com forward slash newsletter. We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[45:18.000 --> 45:30.000]  With known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war. It is a classical 360 when this is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[45:30.000 --> 45:45.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[47:03.000 --> 47:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:11.000 --> 47:30.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[47:30.000 --> 47:50.000]  So what are the chances that Ms. Ford, her father, grandfather, brother, brother-in-law, all work high level CIA, and then a couple of them work in and around the same law firm, Baker and Hostetler, that helped create the original fake piscate dossier.
[47:50.000 --> 48:08.000]  Because that was first done by Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. You now know that. And then she's the one that pops up and then changes her story a whole bunch. And then it turns out she's offering at Stanford official mind control classes on how to implant false memories or remove memories.
[48:08.000 --> 48:15.000]  I just spent two segments showing you that. The article with her papers with the documents is on infowars.com.
[48:15.000 --> 48:25.000]  Forget CIA. You got 17 agencies. It's the whole psychiatric system. It's the real cult in my view. And this is just unbelievable.
[48:25.000 --> 48:34.000]  I mean, I thought she had a motive to get up there and do all this because the RU-486 pill, and she thinks that maybe Cabinon would piss in her Cheerios over making all that money.
[48:34.000 --> 48:45.000]  And I looked at how she changed her story a bunch. And I looked at all the other different angles of this. And just how she was giving a main to Hillary and didn't have any witnesses and couldn't remember any of the details except once she actually got there.
[48:45.000 --> 48:53.000]  But now due process is out the window. Innocent will prove and guilty is out the window. Now they're looking at perjury saying, did he ever pass out drunk?
[48:53.000 --> 49:08.000]  You got professors at Georgetown saying, cut his testicles off, kill him. Georgetown will probably give him an award. The left has gone crazy. You know, a real liberal, a good liberal is Mark Rondaza, probably the top First Amendment lawyer in the country.
[49:08.000 --> 49:15.000]  He certainly has the most courage. And I've got him on about a brief statement here, and then we'll get into some other issues while we have him.
[49:15.000 --> 49:26.000]  We have filed a action in defense of our rights in California, in San Francisco, dealing with PayPal, because they tell us that the last day we can use them is Thursday.
[49:26.000 --> 49:40.000]  And so we filed an injunction in full force files emergency injunction against PayPal and federal court, Silicon Valley Democratic Party and other large corporations working in tandem to drive conservatives for the marketplace in what amounts to a dangerous form of political persecution.
[49:40.000 --> 49:56.000]  That's my words, but Mark wants to be very, let's just say very limited in what he says, and then let the filing we posted, not the entire filing, but the basic suit, not all the exhibits, the basic filing to info wars.com World Exclusive.
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.000]  So Mark, thanks for joining us today.
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  My pleasure.
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  The short and sweet of this because I don't want to get into too much of it.
[50:06.000 --> 50:17.000]  Yeah, I mean, given that it's ongoing litigation that we just filed, I don't want to get too detailed, but it is our position that PayPal should not have been able to cut you off like this.
[50:17.000 --> 50:26.000]  Simply for engaging in your own political speech that it appears that after 18 years of having a good relationship with you.
[50:26.000 --> 50:44.000]  PayPal was influenced in some way to say that you can no longer participate in their online banking platform. And if you watch the steady progress of this that's going on, it should worry you no matter what your political persuasion.
[50:44.000 --> 50:56.000]  It worries me when I see, you know, it always starts with somebody very easy to dislike, and then it moves down the chain and you know it's now run to you.
[50:56.000 --> 51:08.000]  And who knows where it's going to end. But do we really have to have a political litmus test in order to participate in online communication in order to participate in banking.
[51:08.000 --> 51:16.000]  That I think is scary. And you know, there may be people who say that this case has is wrong.
[51:16.000 --> 51:24.000]  Maybe people say it's right, but I think it's the right thing to do to make a stand. And you know, that's what we're doing.
[51:24.000 --> 51:32.000]  Well, people always worry, even if they're not Christian about a world government, a cashless society, a world social score, because it would be perfect to abuse and control people.
[51:32.000 --> 51:40.000]  And then governments and corporations could always demand more behavior modification for your access to have a job to live.
[51:40.000 --> 51:52.000]  And so that's where this is going with Silicon Valley. You talk about it in the suit working in conjunction with other big tech and with big banks to really they're trying to shut the NRA out of banking.
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.000]  They're trying to shut down Cabela's from banking. Cabela's had to go start its own bank.
[51:56.000 --> 52:10.000]  And I mean, this is getting but I don't have the money to go start my own bank. So this whole move by whole industries to bar people from the marketplace, it really smacks of, you know, not letting black folks eat at the lunch counters.
[52:10.000 --> 52:18.000]  I wouldn't go that far. But what I would say is I think your your comparison to China's social score is apt.
[52:18.000 --> 52:28.000]  But you know, I can't believe I'm saying this, but at least the Chinese Communist government's decisions based on a social score, they're at least numerical.
[52:28.000 --> 52:35.000]  You know what it is that costs you points and what gives you points so you can work within the rules.
[52:35.000 --> 52:43.000]  When it comes to the way that these companies have been importing themselves in Silicon Valley, there's no way to know.
[52:43.000 --> 52:50.000]  You know, inside one day, a couple of people are sitting around and say, you know, I think it would be fun if we got rid of Alex Jones.
[52:50.000 --> 52:56.000]  I think it'd be fun if we got rid of, you know, name the next person and it goes on and on.
[52:56.000 --> 53:04.000]  And every single one we let you, you know, every single time they've gotten away with it, they decided to push a little more closer to the mainstream.
[53:04.000 --> 53:14.000]  It really frightens me to think of the fact, you know, I'm an old school liberal who used to remember when we used to be afraid of big corporations taking things over.
[53:14.000 --> 53:23.000]  I mean, you remember that Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton and pretty much everybody in the Democrat and the Democratic Party said,
[53:23.000 --> 53:28.000]  Citizens United is a terrible decision because it gives corporations way too much power.
[53:28.000 --> 53:38.000]  Well, what happened to that philosophy? I mean, I don't trust corporations. I don't really trust governments either, but at least theoretically, you can vote people out of power.
[53:38.000 --> 53:48.000]  What can you do to a privately owned business? You can't do anything. So we're going to give these four companies the power over what we read, what we see, what we hear.
[53:48.000 --> 54:07.000]  And now, when and how we can use money, we were really going to do that. That is just terrifying to me. And, you know, I'm not calling, you know, maybe now it's a great time for conservatives to realize that that liberal fear of unchecked corporate power wasn't so crazy after all.
[54:07.000 --> 54:19.000]  And maybe now is the time to do something about it, because if we don't do something about it now, they're not going to get less powerful. It's not going to be easy tomorrow. It's going to be any easier next month.
[54:19.000 --> 54:31.000]  You know, the best time to plant a tree was 30 years ago. The second best time is today. And I think anybody who's on the sidelines with this, I should hope, is on the corporate board of PayPal.
[54:31.000 --> 54:40.000]  Because other than that, it's your rights that are getting eroded here. It's you that could be the next target. And in five to 10 years, it's going to be too late.
[54:40.000 --> 54:49.000]  And you aren't going to have a nice social score written in Mandarin somewhere that you can read and say, if you do this, you're going to lose points, you do that, you're going to get points.
[54:49.000 --> 55:00.000]  No, it's just going to be at the whim of some secret society, some secret cabal that's going to sit around in a closed door room and say, let's shut these people up.
[55:00.000 --> 55:06.000]  Well, that's where I was going. I'm not likening black folks not able to eat at counters to the current situation.
[55:06.000 --> 55:13.000]  I'm saying where this leads of whole groups tonight access to the market and society, that's where this is leading. That's the whole plan.
[55:13.000 --> 55:24.000]  This is Pavlovian conditioning, Pavlovian control. And then the media demonizes who somebody is and Silicon Valley acts on that fraud, blocks us out of the marketplace.
[55:24.000 --> 55:33.000]  And then they can, once we're shut down, further demonizes because now we've been silenced. Now we've been bankrupted.
[55:33.000 --> 55:45.000]  They admit that that's their plan. And I'm not talking about PayPal specifically, but this whole movement of, I mean, because even the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post said, oh, Jones will be shut down.
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.000]  We'll get all his other payment processors. The admitted goal is to shut me down.
[55:50.000 --> 55:57.000]  Well, and the unadmitted goal is you're just, you're just a mile marker on the way to where they want to go.
[55:57.000 --> 56:06.000]  And that's what's really scary is, I mean, I hate to say this, but if I knew that they were only going to target you and only you and never anybody else,
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.000]  and we said that this is a unique situation, it wouldn't scare me as much.
[56:10.000 --> 56:11.000]  But I agree.
[56:11.000 --> 56:18.000]  It's happening to person after person after person. And this is about societal control by four or five people.
[56:18.000 --> 56:23.000]  Now, let's not forget, PayPal is buying one of the biggest, sorry, go ahead.
[56:23.000 --> 56:28.000]  PayPal is buying up one of the biggest global processors right now. They're consolidating the whole market.
[56:28.000 --> 56:33.000]  So what happens when it's only PayPal and maybe two other banks and they say you can't have a bank account?
[56:33.000 --> 56:36.000]  I mean, that's why they're trying to get rid of cash.
[56:36.000 --> 56:44.000]  Well, you know, maybe Jeff Sessions can put down the pork rinds to do his job and tell the antitrust division to start doing some work.
[56:44.000 --> 56:48.000]  You know, that might be it may be a good day, but I don't know what he's too busy doing.
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  He doesn't seem to be busy to me.
[56:50.000 --> 56:58.000]  Well, regardless, we're raising the alarm with us when I come back and do five more minutes with you just on the subject of cabin on your whole view on that before we go to break folks.
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  For now, we don't know how this injunction is going to work.
[57:00.000 --> 57:05.000]  You got two days left to be able to use PayPal at infowarstore.com.
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  They say they're going to get rid of it Thursday. We'll see how this injunction goes.
[57:08.000 --> 57:12.000]  But this is an attempt to take all our other payment processors and shut us down.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  And not so much even by PayPal.
[57:14.000 --> 57:17.000]  That's what the Democrats and big media and big tech have said the goal is.

[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  I'm going to open the phones up and cover a ton of news.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  Mark Rondaza leaves us at the end of this segment.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  Listen, we have to fight back.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  Everybody knows that if you get a big mega system and the big banks link up and they start denying people the right to commerce,
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:38.000]  simply because of who they claim you are,
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  when you haven't committed a crime or did anything wrong or engaged in fraud, is true persecution.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.000]  It's Hitler's dream.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  First thing Hitler did was start curtailing how Jews and others could do business,
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  then he took them out of banking, and then the rest is history.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  And so this is happening.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  I'm all a free market, sacrosanct, your business, whatever.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  But when they all work in unison and say, we're going to destroy you, it's serious.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  So we filed an injunction, I guess you call it a lawsuit.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Just one more minute on that, Mark Rondaza.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  It's up on infowars.com.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  We might just tell folks basically what this is seeking,
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  a show that when the media asked me, I could point to this video.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:24.000]  I mean, it's kind of complicated because what we're seeking is PayPal has what's called an arbitration clause.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]  So we have to do this before an arbitrator,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000]  but they require 30 days advance notice before you can do that,
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  but PayPal is going to shut you off in 10 days.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  So you don't have the time to do that, to go get an arbitrator to tell them to stop.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  So we're asking the court for a really limited release that the court just says to PayPal,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  hold on, Alex might win this.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000]  So you've got to stop.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:55.000]  You plan to terminate him until you can get this properly before an arbitrator.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000]  And then we'll go into the depths of the argument.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  So really what we're asking for right now is pretty limited.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  But ultimately, the goal of the case and the arbitration will be to try to turn back this tide of really arbitrary
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  and capricious decisions to try to exclude people from the marketplace of ideas.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  And you also get into how their contract basically tries to make you waive all your rights up front.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  And as huge institutions, that's a dangerous precedent,
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  kind of like what they would do with the company store or the old railroads.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  Yeah, we are making that argument in our papers that we feel that they're...
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  I ask anybody out there how many times they've read their online terms and conditions for any service that they use.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  If you have, then you're probably in the one-tenth of one percent.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000]  But of course, they're all written extremely one-sided.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.000]  And that's one thing when it's an entertainment website.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  But when it's something that you actually need in order to participate in commerce, I think it's another story.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  Yeah, what if the airline starts saying,
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  we're not going to let you fly because you're a political affiliation?
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000]  Or what if... I mean, this is a very dangerous precedent.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  In closing, I want your take on Kavanaugh.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  And again, we're not a cult. People say, hey, if Ron does it, agrees or disagrees.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  I mean, I respect you. What's your view on Kavanaugh?
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  You know, I previously did my analysis of him just on his First Amendment jurisprudence.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  And I liked it. I don't really like him on the Fourth Amendment.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  As far as the accusations go, I think there's enough room to call both of them liars.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  But what I really was troubled with is his temperament when he was under pressure.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  You know, I've been before judges who are somewhat tyrannical and not really open to listening to both sides of things.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:51.000]  And the way that he performed there on the stand made it that this is not somebody I'd like to see on the court.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000]  I think we can do better. But you know, it's not to do with the accusations.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000]  It's really to deal with how he's dealt with them.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  And I think if we've got nine people in that court and somebody's put on there for life,
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  I don't want somebody who seems like he's going to turn into a, you know, a caged badger when he's questioned.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  But if you're innocent of these outrageous charges, a normal person will get very, very angry.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.000]  But I'm not looking for normal people on the Supreme Court.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  I'm looking for extraordinary people on the Supreme Court.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  And I was not terribly impressed with that.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]  Let me ask you this then. Do five more minutes with us.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:36.000]  We're going to break for 60 seconds. If you were the Supreme Court nominee and this was happening and it wasn't true,
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  how would you respond? What would your opening statement be when we're back in 60 seconds?
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000]  No, no, you're opening statement, Mark. No time to prepare.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  Mark Nondazza's opening statement, he's been accused of all this stuff with no evidence. And what would he say at that point?
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:05:14.000]  infowars.com, newswars.com, tomorrow's news today.

[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:18.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Inho War.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  35 days out from this incredibly historic election, I'm Alex Jones, your host. Your calls and kind of news are coming up.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  We have filed a restraining order, a lawsuit in San Francisco and federal court against PayPal.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.000]  You can read the lawsuit at infowars.com right now, and it's really about everybody's rights.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:48.000]  I'm fighting whole casual society control system that the megabanks are setting up with Silicon Valley.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:56.000]  Facebook, once you're banking data, they want everything in there so they can have a web ID and then persecute you if you don't play ball with their system.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  Now, first we heard we need due process for these women, but there is no due process for them, and I know that this is a job interview as they're calling it.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  I know there's no way to prove 36 years ago, especially if all of our witnesses say that what she said didn't happen, but we moved past that.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  Now we've got her working for Big Pharma, RU486. That's a reason she doesn't like Kavanaugh, obviously, because she thinks he might restrict that.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  I see that as a motive. You've got her as a big Hillary supporter, but what about her involved in mind control style programs of false memories, new memories, funded by DARPA and co-authoring major studies at Stanford.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  She's coming up after Mark Rondaza leaves us. This is just insane. You've got her whole family in the CIA, basically, and then you've got this Krim Dala Krim project of DARPA, and then you've got the Unabomber, and you've got the Aurora shooter, and they're all in these same programs.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  Earlier I showed mainstream news. Psychology Today, L.A. Times, all of it. People don't know this. They go, oh, Jones claims they're involved in mind control. No, the L.A. Times does.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  Okay? So I'm telling you, why does this continue to pop up? It needs to be looked at. We're going to be talking about in a moment. But going back to Mark Rondaza, Mark Jeff Flake saying the same thing you were saying earlier.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:22.000]  We can't have that on the court. Sharp and partisan saying he was getting so angry at people saying he's raping women on boats that isn't true and raping people in Colorado.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  Turns out it isn't true, and now there's anonymous letters sent to Congress that the news puts out that a woman saw him rape a woman in a car, and another anonymous woman said that she saw him rape the daughter.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  But that wasn't true, and then that's withdrawn, and all this talk of criminal charges of the people putting these false reports out.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:47.000]  I mean, I just think the way they waited to the 11th hour to bring this out, all this to me, stinks to high heaven.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  Oh, yeah, look, I think the villain in this is Diane Feinstein, who had that information and sat on it for the whole summer.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  There would have been plenty of time to investigate without this. But at the same time, you got to respect the fact that this is politics, and that was a strategic decision by her.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:13.000]  I didn't find her very credible when they were asking her who leaked the information either. So as far as we have credibility problem there, I think she's gone.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:29.000]  But Mr. Kavanaugh has won as well. I don't understand why he spent all this time trying to pain himself as having been a pretty angelic kid back in high school and college.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  I mean, look, if that had been me, I can't run away from a lot of the things I did in high school and college.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:45.000]  I mean, you were saying, what would happen if I were nominated to the Supreme Court? I mean, I'd probably have to just walk in there in a pirate outfit and say, oh man, you guys don't know the half of it.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:49.000]  Let me start laying out some of the crazy stuff I did. And why run away from it?
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  You know, there was a movie a while back where Robin Williams was a comedian running for office. And they put a microphone in front of his face and he said, yeah, I've smoked pot, I've done cocaine, I've had group sex.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  You know, what do you got? And that was the end of that. And remember that that was, you know, again, that was what people did in their personal lives back then was how we liberals used to say everything ought to be when they were bothering with Gary Hart or bothering with Bill Clinton's past.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:37.000]  You know, now that's all on its head because it's politics time. That bothers me. But when I look at Kavanaugh, and I see that he's just been so inconsistent, and, you know, and really trying to paint himself as something he's not just if there was me and I was in his situation, I'd have come out and said,
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  yeah, I was a pretty hard part here in high school and college and law school. I don't think there's any credence to any of these allegations. I would love there to be an FBI investigation, take all the time you want, have another investigation,
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  investigate me and investigate everybody who's making these allegations and bring back what you got, because I'm not afraid of any of it.
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  You know, that sounds reasonable, but they're trying to block, they're trying to stalled the nomination. But I mean, I'll give you this when they say, well, how much beer did you drink?
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:25.000]  Well, I drank some beer. Did you drink beer? I mean, I mean, I almost kind of like the fact that it's upsetting him that he's a real person. And Mark, I don't know that a few people that went to college with him or high school said that he was a heavy drinker is proof when they're Democrat professors.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  Why is it all professors accusing him? Well, you know, look, that could be any number of reasons, you know, there could be people who know him, who want him to be on the court that know he was a hard part here.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  I really don't know. All I know is that when you ask me a question like that, I'm going to give you a direct answer. And I don't think that's what he did.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  He just, I didn't like his temperament. I didn't like his evasiveness. I didn't like how he answered a lot of those questions. And, you know, there's only nine people in the Supreme Court. And, you know, I already think we could do better than some of the ones we have.
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  And you were saying during the break, you were saying during the break that you thought that Trump's big take control would be just withdrawing and put Barrett in there.
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:23.000]  Look, that'd be the power play. You know, Trump just said, look, you know, there's too much of a cloud here. I think that what Dianne Feinstein did was shameful. I think what the Democrats did is shameful.
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:33.000]  But if I'm going to appoint somebody for a lifetime and you put this cloud over his head, shame on you for doing it, but I'm going to withdraw his name. And yeah, and then, and then put her up.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  Well, I'll say this, I want to get the victory and I think it's been made up of the Democrats, but I get your point. Now the Democrats are talking about trying to impeach him later, talking about Kavanaugh.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  And like, they're going to just keep this going. They have literally crapped in the punch bowl, but here's the problem. We let them get away with this. They'll do it again and again.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  But I agree, they're not going to buy if they if he puts Barrett up that she raped women. I mean, because they're going to have women come out, they're going to all be MK ultra professors, probably do.
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  And they'll say she's wearing a cat woman outfit. I saw her slit children's throats, drink the blood and people I don't think will buy it if they do that. What do you think?
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  Look, I think that whoever they put, I mean, I think there's enough blame to spread around everybody.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  I mean, politics with the court. I mean, let's face it. There used to be a rule that you had to have 60 senators to approve a nominee, which tended to push us towards a little more moderate of nominees and you kind of want the court to be nominated to be moderate.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  The Democrats got rid of that. And I thought it was a bad idea when they did it because now all you need is 51 and that's enough. That's a problem.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:49.000]  Let me ask you this question because they have done their own delay it was to say they're trying to delay it till after the midterms. Well, of course they are. I mean, and what did the Republicans do when Merrick Garland got nominated?
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  You know, they delayed it almost 10 months. Let me ask you this then. So gut level. Do you think Kavanaugh gets confirmed?
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:09.000]  Do I think he gets confirmed? No, I think Jeff Flake is the swing vote here. Jeff Flake is the 51st vote. And I think Jeff Flake is somebody who doesn't care about getting reelected.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  I mean, he's already retired one time. He's just there to finish out John McCain's term. And, you know, I think Jeff Flake maybe positions himself as a heck of a choice as a maybe a Republican nominee for president.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  If he can assuage some of the left with the decision not to support Kavanaugh. So my money's on Flake turning.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  Well, you're right that Flake's leaving with the other guy that just took over from McCain. Let's go ahead though. Since you mentioned, here's fine. It's fine. Bumbling around. It's all right. Go ahead.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations. I did not leak her story. She asked me to hold it confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:15:03.000]  She apparently was stalked by the press, felt that what happened, she was forced to come forward, and her greatest fear was realized.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  She's been harassed, she's had death threats, and she's had to flee her home.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  In addition, the investigation that the Republican majority is heralding is really nothing that I know about other than a part of her practice.
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:26.000]  Well, listen, Mark, bottom line, we're going to be able to get your response coming up this week, and we're going to see what happens.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  But I'm glad that we've filed this because it's the right thing to do with PayPal. Thank you so much. Anything else?
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  Yeah, well, you look at Feinstein's testimony there, and I'm not buying that either. I mean, I buy it when she says technically, I did not leak it.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  He's one of her staffers did. I would be willing to bet a heck of a lot of money that one of her staffers did, or somebody who did it at her, at her direction, or her way to nod.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:16:18.000]  All right, Mark Rondaza, thanks. We'll be back with a ton of news, your phone calls. Stay with us.

[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:57.000]  I got no friends. Can't be seen with me.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  I knew that if we took on the globalist, they were authoritarian, they were corrupt, they were out of control, they were evil, they were tax exempt, they had diplomatic immunity and then they wanted you to be poor.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  I knew that a large portion of people would want to be free and wouldn't want to be schmucks. And I knew that we would start to win.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  But I also knew that I would end up getting attacked. I also knew that I would get demonized and they would try to take me down. But here's the deal.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  We're in the same company as many other great trailblazers throughout history. And so it's not fun at one level to have people go FU Russian agent on the street.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  But it's better than letting this huge corrupt global system take over and continue to break our back and break up our families and turn us against each other and promote racism and modern mind control.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  So I'm a winner. Like Tommy Robinson says, I'm not a victim. I'm a target. Well, I'm not a victim. I'm a target. Now that said, I personally would like to win this myself.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  I'll do whatever it takes to win the big fight against the globalists, even if it means they kill me. Doesn't mean I want to die. Doesn't mean I'm looking for death. Doesn't mean I'm suicidal. The opposite.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  People ask me in interviews, they say, how far will you go? You've been persecuted. You've been attacked. You've been sued. You've been demonized. And I say, I'm going to go all the way to death. I have to.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  I'm ready to die. Doesn't mean I want to die. It means I'm ready to be ready to fight. Doesn't mean I'm looking to fight.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  But somebody starts to fight with me. I'm going to fight back. Doesn't mean I want to get in the fight.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  I'm ready to die. I don't want to die. But if I need to, I'm ready. And, you know, at kind of a sick level, I fight these people so hard and I have so much passion to do it that I'll never give up.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:13.000]  And I work harder even as I get older. And it really means a lot to me to stop these people because I know how bad they are. And they've done so many things to me that every victory we have is that much more important.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:23.000]  It's beyond savoring it. It's beyond vitriol. It's beyond exaltation. It's beyond triumph. It's just doing the right thing.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  It's like being thrown off a boat in the middle of the ocean and swimming 10 miles back to shore. Every muscle is burning and you're about to pass out.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  You're drinking, you know, seawater gulping in on accident. You're about to pass out. But somehow you make it onto that beach.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  Even though you feel like you're dead, you're in heaven. And it's that same thing. I've already made it to the beach in the allegory, but my family and billions of people are not there yet.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:24:03.000]  And so I've got to go back out into the ocean and I've got to go through that pain and all of that again because I don't want to be on this island alone.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  And that's really how it feels. We have a lot of big breaking news. I'm going to give the phone number out and take a lot of calls today, obviously on Cabinon.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:24.000]  On us filing lawsuit against PayPal to defend our rights and your rights and just start the conversation about what's going on even though it is an uphill battle.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  We've done so much more and we have an incredible Millie Weaver video that has been posted to infowars.com. It is the raw video. We've had it bleeped and we've for TV.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  When you're on broadcast TV, you can't even show people flipping off. So we have to do a bunch of, we put Make America Great Again over his shirt saying F Trump and over him flipping everybody off.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  We have that family version coming up and these folks admit that they're here illegally.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  And then there's a man there who lost his daughter and he gets in their face because there's this arrogance. It's like the lady that confronted flake and said, how dare you?
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  He's raping women. You're going to let me get raped. Women are being raped, raped, raped. She's from Columbia. She's a lesbian.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  She's got two kids. I guess she adopted. Fine. And she's just screaming how America sucks when in Columbia, they kill hundreds and hundreds of gays a year, which is a bad thing.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  But America is this super open, inclusive country. And then now you've got the LGBTP. I had pedophiled again. That's part of it.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:44.000]  Six year old pupils write gay love letters to learn to accept diversity. We're going to play the video of that coming up.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:54.000]  So you put your children in school and they tell six year olds, little boys write love letters to boys, girls write to girls. This is people sexualizing your children.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  This is Cavistock Institute breakdown of civilization. This is brutal. So that's coming up as well next segment. But first, we got a big blitz next segment.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:18.000]  Then your calls start at least two packages into the Pentagon suspect to contain Ryerson, the deadly neurotoxin poison officials say at least two packages into the Pentagon are suspect to be hitting Ryerson.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  A Pentagon spokesman confirmed to Fox News today. The packages never made them to into the Pentagon, but were flagged in a mail delivery building next door.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  The spokesman said the FBI has led the investigation. Officials told Fox News on Monday, the Pentagon force protection agency detected a suspicious substance during mail screening.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:48.000]  The Pentagon's remote screening facility. Colonel Robert Manning said in the statement, the envelopes were taken by the FBI this morning for further analysis.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  All USPS mail received of the Pentagon mail screening facility is currently under quarantine and pose no threat to the Pentagon personnel.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  Wonder who it was getting mailed to. Ryerson is a poison that can take several different forms, but it's purified powder can be deadly.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  It's also one of the easiest poisons of manufacture. In June, Wisconsin mom was accused of spreading ISIS propaganda online, putting direction directing one person how to make Ryerson how to deploy it in a government facility or water reservoir.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  The same month, an Islamic extremist Ryerson attack planned for Germany was foiled.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  And remember, we should get McAfee back on. He found out that the Belizean government was giving Hezbollah passports into the US and that they were producing Ryerson there.
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  And I didn't think he was lying, but two years after he said it here, it came out in the news that he was going on. I was blown away.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:48.000]  So I would say Islamic, it will be the main culprit or some leftist false flag. We're not sure we will follow that as it unfolds, obviously here.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  We're going to go to break. You can still use PayPal. And I guess my lawyer is saying, no, keep it up there. Don't stop using it. We're filing an injunction.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  That's the whole point of it. So as long as PayPal works, it comes through. We'll process it and ship you your order at infowarstore.com.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  You don't have to use PayPal if you don't want. We have other payment systems at infowarstore.com as well.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  But obviously, we're the tip of the spear. We're having a big effect. We're covering real issues. We're relaunching Americana. The country's coming back from the dead.

[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:11.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:20.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:25.000]  Well, we're 35 days out from this incredibly historic event.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  And things are heating up. You've got Christine Blasey Ford, their entire family being high level CIA,
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  her co-authoring top papers at Stanford in DARPA's CIA funded projects on implanting false memories
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  and mind control under a larger direction.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  For human experimentation and torture, it's unbelievable.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  So we're going to be looking more at that. This is incredible.
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  The full article, Christine Blasey Ford ran mass hypnotic inductions to implant false memories
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  on psychiatric participants.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  I'll cover this more at the bottom of the next hour after we take calls.
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  But I went over the L.A. Times in psychology today. Did you know Theodore Kaczynski?
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.000]  The Unabomber was in the MK Ultra Mind Control Program?
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  Oh, did you know that the Aurora shooter was? That was in the mainstream days?
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  His psychiatrist was the former head of Air Force psychiatric operations.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  His father, a colonel, also in the Air Force assigned to NASA in space command,
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  is a top expert on machine controlled systems in human minds.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  And of course, the son was paid $90,000 plus a year to work directly in a mind control program.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:08.000]  And he said he was under mind control after he carried out the shooting.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  And that was in the Denver Post.
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  But when you go to the Southern Poverty Law Center or Media Matters, they just say,
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  Jones claims that's mind control.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:28.000]  I don't claim Jack Diddly Squat. I don't know what's going on.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:34.000]  I just know Tim McVeigh was in a mind control program. That came out in the news.
[01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  James Holmes was. Theodore Kaczynski was.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  And now this lady heads up major projects on implanting false memories.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  Good God.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  And we've got the psychiatric systems got 30% of people on psychotropic drugs.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  And now they want to put all the kids on them.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  They want to put lithium in the water. We've got mad scientists running the country.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  I told you, she looks like a lunatic to me.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  Oh, but people say, oh, don't question a victim because she says she's a victim.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  She's a victim. Well, there's an article up on infowars.com right now.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  That I'm going to get to here in just a few minutes.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  Well, you've got this Georgetown professor saying she wants to kill Cabinon wants to chop his testicles off.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  And of course, she'll probably get an award that same university shooing me with a bunch of made up garbage.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  White GOP senators deserve a miserable death.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  He deserves to have his testicles chopped off.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  That's the type of stuff we're dealing with as a culture and as a society.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  But first, I want to get to this report that everybody should send out.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  It's on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:18.000]  And the version you're going to see here is edited and cut down with the cussing on cut out of it and flipping the bird and the f this f that deleted.
[01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  But the full unedited is on infowars.com.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:28.000]  Right now, man confronts illegals over loss of his daughter.
[01:37:28.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  Epic debate at Tennessee Trump rally while interviewing protesters at a recent Trump rally in Johnson City, Tennessee.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:42.000]  A man confronts a woman advocating illegal immigration over the wrongful death of his daughter by repeat offending a legal alien.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  This heated exchange captures the heart of the issue and one of the people says I'm illegal.
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  Well, the whole point is we're seeing incredible arrogance here.
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  And Mexico and everybody else controls their borders.
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  Why can't we that there's such incredible entitlement?
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:02.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Millie Weaver's report.
[01:38:02.000 --> 01:38:06.000]  I don't like the fact that he is putting kids in cage.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000]  That's not that's not that's inhumane.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000]  If you ask me, it's not right.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  I don't like the fact that he's separating families.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:14.000]  I don't think you would have liked to be separated whenever you were younger.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  And I have a strong bond with my mom.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000]  I would have never pictured myself being separated by my mom.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  I know, you know, I know the feeling that the kids have and it's sad.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  Every time I watch the news, there's even more kids being caged up.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  That's not right. Dogs are caged up, not humans.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  So are you talking about the issue of people being deported that are here illegally?
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000]  No, I'm not saying that and I'm not saying that.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  I'm just saying that he shouldn't cage up kids who have families who support them and love them.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  I'm saying I don't think it's right for him to be separating children at such a young age.
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  So are you talking about the issue where you had all the times and a bunch of these articles
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  talking about how kids were being separated from their family at the border?
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  Yeah, I think that's really inhumane. I don't think it's right.
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  Did you hear about how the little girl who was pictured on Time Magazine crying
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  that her parents came out and said that that was fake because they were with her the whole time
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  and she was just kind of having a little temper tantrum and they took that picture
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:18.000]  and they lied and said that she was a child that was being taken from her family when she never was.
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:20.000]  Did you hear about that?
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  All right, that's one. That's one person who lied. That's one person who lied.
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  That's not all of them. That's not all of them.
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  You can get out of here. You can get out of here. You can get out of here.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:36.000]  I'm not in your face. You're in my face.
[01:39:36.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  When I say something, if you guys don't care, I'm an immigrant. I'm from Argentina.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:46.000]  I came here the right way.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  You have to understand that.
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  Go to jail.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  Why were you?
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:58.000]  Because they're down in America. Look what one of them did to my daughter.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  So what happened? Can you tell us about what happened?
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.000]  She was at Fort DUI in Jonesboro and an illegal hitter had on doing over a hundred mile an hour
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:10.000]  and had three of his kids in his car and my grandson was with my daughter.
[01:40:10.000 --> 01:40:14.000]  My daughter died. I don't never get to see my daughter again.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  He left the country. It's sorry, sheriff we got, let him walk right out of the hospital, right out of the county
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:26.000]  and he's gone. He's in Mexico. Our country is so sorry they won't go to Mexico and get nobody
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  but they're allowed to come here.
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  So you're really upset because you lost your daughter to the illegal immigration issue.
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:40.000]  On his fourth DUI, he was on probation for his third DUI. How would you feel?
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  Is this your grandbaby?
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  This is one of them. Yeah, I got seven of them.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:48.000]  Well, I'm sorry for your loss. That's horrible.
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  Well, there ain't nothing that nobody can say to make me feel any better.
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:41:02.000]  More of it is on infowars.com right now. You notice the illegal aliens are all wearing Mexico soccer jerseys.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  They're saying FUF that totally entitled but don't want to be in Mexico.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  But want to come here and then get upset and get angry and get everybody's face. It's just crazy.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:22.000]  And it's true. It's come out even in Austin, Texas that they let illegal aliens go for burglary,
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  for arson, for rape, for DUI hit and run because they're just told let them go.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  They're above the law because the left wants to cater to this to create vulcanization.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  Very, very sad that we've gotten to this point in this country.
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  And you just see the arrogance of the folks flipping everybody off and saying,
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  F Trump, F this and then lying. Oh, a lot of these kids get separated. You have millions of people trying to cram across the border every couple years.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.000]  Like a million a year really back and forth.
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:06.000]  And most of the children are unaccompanied. You're like, got a 12 year old? Who are you? Where's your ID? Who are you with?
[01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  Oh, this is my daddy. You don't even know it's their daddy. Most of the time it's not. It's the Coyote.
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  You just stick them in general. It was the ACLU 30 years ago got the law changed.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  So you wouldn't stick kids in with random groups you grab off the border.
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  People bringing their kids across all that death, all that desert. They're not the bad ones.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  No, it's America paying for it all, but they're sure as hell fighting to get here as soon as they can.
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  And as soon as they get here, the left lines them up to these anti-American folks.
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:42.000]  I couldn't imagine walking around Mexico wearing USA shirts, then walking up and bitching at Mexicans.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  You let me have welfare and everything free. They would laugh at me and then kick my butt. Everybody knows it.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:54.000]  But we're all seen as schmucks in America, aren't we? I'll give the number out when we come back.
[01:42:54.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  We got a lot more. Stay with us.
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:43:02.000]  X2. We were selling it for about three years and then they found out how big it was.
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  And how much we were buying. And they said, oh, we want more money, more money. And oh, this and that.
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:13.000]  And so I've broken my contract. And right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in next to it.
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a picker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses.
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:24.000]  Like I dream of genie and it's purple gas. I mean, that is so pure it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago.
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  So I get the price down. I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done. I'm breaking the contract.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:40.000]  Well, I broke the contract last week. And so this is potentially the last run.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:43.000]  In fact, right now it is the last run of survival shield X2.
[01:43:43.000 --> 01:43:46.000]  And we've got a good supply of it. It'll be gone a couple of months.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:51.000]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, m4store.com. If you have experienced it, you know how great it is.
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:56.000]  I suggest you stock up on it. It's available right now for a moment of time, m4store.com right now.
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:44:01.000]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:44:01.000 --> 01:44:10.000]  M4Words is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:12.000]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:15.000]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.000]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:20.000]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:28.000]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  and if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, m4words.com,
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags. We'll win.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:42.000]  We have huge sales at m4store.com right now.
[01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:49.000]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market.
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.000]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Glove will swing when.
[01:44:53.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  This is M4Words Darker Sour. With your support, I'm counting on you.
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health, joint health and cognitive health,

[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:28.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., we have the most censored band attacked light about broadcast in the world.
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:35.000]  Because we're really just talking about common sense and giving people the news behind the news, the story behind the story.
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:37.000]  35 days out from the election.
[01:47:37.000 --> 01:47:41.000]  We're going to open the phones up right now for folks that have called in lately that I didn't get to.
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  You go to the first line or first time callers.
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:53.000]  Those two different groups I'd like to hear from you on Cabinon, you on these liberal professors calling for people to be murdered and killed,
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:56.000]  what's happening with the whole NAFTA situation.
[01:47:56.000 --> 01:48:02.000]  Some of the media's spinning it that Trump sold us out on NAFTA because he now renegotiated it to be a better deal.
[01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:04.000]  No, we have to have agreements.
[01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:06.000]  What do you think about that?
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789 Alex, 877-789-2539 is the number to join us, 877-789 Alex.
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:26.000]  And we can get into any big subject you'd like to cover from the two packages of Ryerson, intercepted being sent to the Pentagon.
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  That's breaking as well.
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  Do you think Cabinon is going to get confirmed?
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  You know, I know this.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:35.000]  I'll get some of these clips here in a moment.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  We have Julie Swetnick now saying that she doesn't remember if Cabinon did anything, contradicting her previous statements.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  And again, I've got stacks of news here where a letter was sent by an anonymous person to the Senate saying they shot Cabinon, another man, a rape a woman in a car.
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.000]  I mean, when you're a public figure, people say unbelievable stuff.
[01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:13.000]  I remember on YouTube, when I was getting divorced like five years ago, I got asked in depositions.
[01:49:13.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  And I got asked in written questions, is this your wife in Louisiana?
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  Because some woman I'd never seen said that I was her wife, I mean, her husband.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  And when you're confronted with this stuff, I'm like, Cabinon, I'm like, what? No.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:37.000]  They're like, are you sure? Because it's a mix of wanting to laugh or a mix of wanting to get angry.
[01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  Because when you're a public figure, people make stuff up about you particularly.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:56.000]  But then what's even worse is I get banned from 90 plus major platforms, from Instagram to Facebook to Twitter to Google to YouTube.
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:04.000]  And then all Google does is put hundreds of pages of negative lies and crap on top about me and then doesn't let me respond.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:07.000]  It's the cowardice of these big corporations.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  And then they get on TV and say, we're not censoring, we're not gaming our search engines, we're not doing a damn thing.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  And then you get their own internal documents and their own whistleblowers go public and they say they're helping round up their political dissidents.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:26.000]  They're putting all the negative search results on top about Trump and his enemies.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  Stuff is right up there where they can lie about it.
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  And I've been lumped in with Trump because I've supported the president because the globalists hate his guts and he's trying as hard as he can to bring governance back to this country.
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  Does that mean everything he does is perfect? No.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  But I got to tell you, he's not a dictator and I'm glad he's not.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  But he can't get everything done he wants to get done and I'm surprised by how much he's gotten done 20 months in.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:02.000]  And a lot of people that don't appreciate it, I think have that disease of instant gratification.
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:04.000]  I think you really, really do.
[01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:12.000]  And I'm not complaining in our general audience, but when people accuse me of being in a love fest with Trump, well, you're damn right it's a love fest.
[01:51:12.000 --> 01:51:17.000]  Because I've sacrificed a lot for President Trump.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  It's like he sacrificed a lot for me and you.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:25.000]  And we're in this together and they say the pressure of persecution brings people very, very close together and it does.
[01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  Because we're all fellow travelers now.
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  Use the communist term in a good way.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000]  We've been to the fire together.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  We're going to go through more fire together.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.000]  And I'll tell you, this crew has been to the fire and I love them and I appreciate them.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:42.000]  And they put up with me and just a round of applause for the info or screw and a round of applause.
[01:51:42.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  For all of you out there that have stood with us because we're doing this not because it's easy, but because it's the right thing to do.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  And I've seen evil out of our enemies.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  Not just from the top kingpins I expected it from, but from their own grass level minions who'd have a better life if they just stood up for what was right.
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  But because they imagine they've got power through the system, they have taken on the spirit of corruption.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:16.000]  The fallen spirit of the establishment and will now do anything.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  I've experienced people that I knew for 15 years tell lies that are 100%.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:28.000]  God as my witness on my children lies.
[01:52:28.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  You expect something to be true.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  It's like, wow, you made it all up.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  You didn't find something in spin it.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  You just made up total lies.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:39.000]  That hurts.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:50.000]  It hurts me to know how far you've fallen and that the general public is that evil and that people bite the hand that feeds them.
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  But I'm telling you, it's the entitlement society where the weak think the strong are there to take care of them.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  And when we try to take care of the weak, they then try to make us their slaves.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  The globalists say, hey, control the weak, make them weaker, make them think you're helping them, but really enslave them.
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  And that's the real system you've got from the Democrats.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  Trump is trying to empower the individual, the family, the worker, the striver.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  He's trying to reboot and defibrillate our heart.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  And for that, he's hated by the controllers who gave up on themselves and gave up on humanity a long, long, long time ago.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:39.000]  So we'll start the next hour on the right to your phone calls.
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:46.000]  Chris and Brendan and Luke and Cynthia and Mike and everybody else at 877-789 Alex.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  And I'll get to some of these clips as well. The Kavanaugh accuser now changing her story and so much more.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  But I've got to tell you, it makes my head spin that nine times out of ten, when you've got a big mass shooting or a big Supreme Court debacle or a unabomber,
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  you know, just say in the newspaper, they were in the CIA Mind Control program.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  That's not my opinion. That's psychology today.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:24.000]  The Aurora shooter, Tim McVeigh, Oklahoma City, the unabomber.
[01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  And I don't know what's going on. I just know something's going on.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:36.000]  When you might have one tent, the one percent of people on these Mind Control programs and then 90% of the people involved in all this stuff are in the program.
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  Something's going on. Riddle me this Batman.
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:46.000]  Don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to know something's going on here.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:51.000]  And see, these people don't want you looking at it. They don't want you investigating it. They don't want you talking about it.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.000]  And they don't want this broadcast up here getting into it. And that's why they're trying to shut us down.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  But I can tell you something right now. You think I want to sue the Pepe the Frog creator when he sued me?
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  I had to sue him. He really tried to settle for nothing because they just want to tell me what images I can use when it's very use.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  And he said it was very use. You think I want to sue PayPal?
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:17.000]  I got to stand up against this market to be system, but I'm doing it.
[01:55:17.000 --> 01:55:25.000]  And that's why I need you to fund our operation because we're at war for not just what info wars is doing for your rights as well.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:31.000]  And I am fighting and I'm swinging for the fences and I'm not giving up and I believe in you.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:36.000]  I'm going to go down with this ship or I'm going to roll through the enemy and win on the other side.
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  Because the fights where I want to be and I want to be on the right side of history and the right side of God.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:51.000]  But I'll tell you this. It is so powerful when you go to infowarstore.com and you get t-shirts and you wear them in public and you meet like-minded people
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:55.000]  and you exercise that First Amendment and you get past the fear.
[01:55:55.000 --> 01:56:04.000]  And when you get the supplements and see how great they work compared to other supplements, you find out we put more high quality ingredients in the products than anybody else we know of anywhere.
[01:56:04.000 --> 01:56:07.000]  Ours are the best.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:14.000]  Tomorrow is the last day to get brain force plus 40% off.

[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  You know, I'd said today was the last day to get PayPal but I talked to the lawyers last night and they said no, we're doing an injunction to stop it.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:30.000]  Keep it up there. They say Thursday is the last day.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:35.000]  And then if they take it down, that's another issue you won't be able to use PayPal infowarstore.com.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  But if your order goes through, we'll get it and it'll be shipped to you.

[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  I said today was the last day but things changed because obviously we followed suit in San Francisco against PayPal.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  And for a lot of reasons.

[01:56:55.000 --> 01:57:00.000]  But we're fighting. Other people say, oh, we wish someone would fight the UN or fight Hillary.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  Well, we put airplanes up all over the country against her and said she was a monster.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:10.000]  Hillary for prison shirts, you wore them and we had thousands of folks go to her events and point out Bill Clinton's a rapist and we did it.
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:13.000]  We got on her radar and now she's trying to destroy me.
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:18.000]  So understand ladies and gentlemen, we're a weapon system of the truth that needs to be maintained.

[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  But I would ask for your hopes and your prayers and your financial support.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  Because you know what? I'm willing to be destroyed.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.000]  But darn it, that'll be a big victory for the enemy and I hope it doesn't happen.

[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:29.000]  Hi, I'm your host, Alex Jones. We're on your phone calls right now.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:35.000]  Then I'm going to play some of the Kavanaugh accusers backtracking on what they've said. Wow, imagine my surprise.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:41.000]  You know, I had one of my lawyers on as a smart guy, Mark Rendazzo. He's more of a classical liberal.
[02:00:41.000 --> 02:00:45.000]  And he liked Kavanaugh on the First Amendment, not on the Fourth Amendment, which I tend to agree.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:49.000]  Kavanaugh has been a little too police-steady on the Fourth Amendment.
[02:00:49.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  But the court's been so leftist, I think that balances it out.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  I mean, hell, the left is for a bigger police state than the right wing is today.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:01:01.000]  But he's got a good point about Kavanaugh getting upset, but at the same time, I'd be upset.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:05.000]  I'm pissed off. I'm tired of, like, I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  I'm sick of people that can just sit there and take it and roll over to lies.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  Like Adam McGinnis at your state.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  Well, since when the conservatives just roll over, like the head of the EPA, because they have got to front in a restaurant, quit.
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  If we act like that to the left of these bullies, they're going to go wild on us.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  So we're going to go to your calls here, Travis, David, Donald, Adam, Josh, Stephanie, Chris, Chris, Brandon, Luke,
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:37.000]  Cynthia, Mike, and many, many others. Who is up first here?
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  Let's talk to Donald, then we'll go to Stephanie, then we'll go to Cynthia.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  Donald, you're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  Alex, it's great to talk with you.
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  To talk to you.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:57.000]  Let me, I called you about the Kavanaugh nomination, but let me, let me say right up front that you and I have never personally met.
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:07.000]  But sometime maybe hopefully we will, because I want to tell you when you got a lot of credibility with me was when the campaign was going on with Donald Trump,
[02:02:07.000 --> 02:02:17.000]  when he was a candidate and with the crooked Clinton machine, she called you out at one of her rallies and she never did that with anybody else.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:25.000]  And that, that told me then that you were spot on about what was going to happen.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:31.000]  You were, you were one of the very few, you kept the faith up as far as who was going to win the election.
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  And I just want to give a 100% shout out to your team, Leigh Ann, Millie, Owen, David, and whoever I've left out.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  And by the way, Leigh Ann is still on the team. People ask about her every day.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  I don't want to get into her personal life, but her grandma and then another person close to her.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:53.000]  She needs people's prayers. I mean, cancer has been attacking her family.
[02:02:53.000 --> 02:02:57.000]  Her family needs your prayers because she's gotten really rough for her.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:03:01.000]  Exactly. And she'll certainly will be doing that.
[02:03:01.000 --> 02:03:07.000]  When Millie Weaver went to Ohio and exposed the Clinton campaign.
[02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  Oh, isn't Millie incredible?
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  Absolutely. And let me say that she didn't have anybody. All she had was the deep state and you exposed it.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:27.000]  And that's why they're going after you and they're going to fail because this is not some third world banana Republic.
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  This is the United States of America and you are a media hero.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  And I want to say this, look, if you know about the evil, just like you've done in Millie and Gavin, everybody, you know it's the right thing to do.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  And so it's about survival. And I just want everybody else to understand we can beat these folks, but we have stirred them up like an anthill and they're making their move.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:51.000]  So folks seem to know we didn't win when Trump got in.
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:55.000]  We just got the beachhead. They are coming out of their anthills right now.
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  And now is the time for folks to understand that things are serious.
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.000]  Yeah, but they're they're losing consistently.
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:05.000]  And that leads me right up to the Cavanaugh nomination.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  I tell you what, stay there, Donald, because they're breaking 30 seconds.
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  Come right back to Donald, Maryland. Don't hang up, Donald.
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:15.000]  Come back to Donald and we're going to go to Stephanie and Cynthia and everybody else. Boom, boom, boom.
[02:04:15.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  He's making some good points. I want to hear what he has to say about Cavanaugh.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  Listen, that wasn't an act last week when I blew up on air about watching Cavanaugh being accused.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  I can't watch these hearings now.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  And I'm not feeling sorry for myself.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  I've been falsely accused so much that at a certain point I can't watch these people anymore because I want to get very aggressive because they're damn liars.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  And we know they're liars and I'm sick of everyone bending over backwards.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:51.000]  If you're a Democrat and you say something, I don't believe the skies blue if you said it was because you're a pack of trash.
[02:04:51.000 --> 02:05:17.000]  You're a known group of liars like the devil.
[02:05:17.000 --> 02:05:27.000]  So we've already had incredible success, but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target.
[02:05:27.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  And if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, m4s.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags. We'll win.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:48.000]  We have huge sales at m4s.com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market.
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globalist may win.
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:55.000]  This is M4s Darkest Hour. We're your support. I'm counting on you.
[02:05:55.000 --> 02:06:15.000]  He aligns himself with the truth that it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:45.000]  All right, coming up, we've got a bunch of the different cabin occupiers now back cracking a bunch of the other cases have been trying to be fake.
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:55.000]  The national news runs. Oh, we got a letter at the Senate saying he raped a woman in a car. It's a it's a Jane Doe. There's no address or no phone number, but we're going to run with it.
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:07:11.000]  I mean, I could go pin on somebody's door that they had sex with hippopotamuses. Wouldn't mean it was true. You got to put it on CNN and then left as professors who said cabin all supporters should be killed and castrated has been suspended by Twitter.
[02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:19.000]  What about by Georgetown? I mean, these people are using psychological warfare.
[02:07:19.000 --> 02:07:31.000]  You read the WikiLeaks. It says we need to use culture war, race war, and they're all a bunch of weird, crazy white women. 90% of them are whacked out, angry, pissed off man haters.
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:37.000]  I love women, by the way. I love my grandmothers. I love my mother. I have three daughters. I like the company of women better than men.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:47.000]  All I do is hang around women. I love the way women look, the way they smell. They're funny. I like to spoil them. I've never been anything but nice to women.
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:08:01.000]  But I'm telling you, nine times out of 10, it's weird, whacked out, crazy white women that want to control other women. Everybody knows about that phenomenon and who want to run our lives.
[02:08:01.000 --> 02:08:10.000]  They're control freaks, man. And they're trying to train all other women in America that the state's their husband or that they're their husband.
[02:08:10.000 --> 02:08:20.000]  And I'm sick of it. And I'm tired of it. And I see the headlines. This Hollywood star says men just need to shut up and sit down.
[02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:29.000]  And this Democrat woman says men need to sit down and shut up. And men are always guilty and men are horrible and men are bad BS, man.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:39.000]  Imagine we said women are inherently bad. This is just the most sexist racist garbage because that's what they're using for control.
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:54.000]  They don't want you to take your birthright of free market and wealth and family and success. They want the university and these cults and these failed systems to be your family so they can run your life, women.
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:09:03.000]  The men are busy watching football and acting like idiots. So I know why you're mad at them, but give me a break. This is scientifically deployed to ruin your life.
[02:09:03.000 --> 02:09:08.000]  Let's go back to Donald and Marilyn. Donald, thanks for holding your makeup point about Kavanaugh. Go ahead.
[02:09:08.000 --> 02:09:20.000]  Absolutely. This is just an attack on Trump voters and Americans who support as the president says the movement.
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:38.000]  This attack on you is to silence the movement of making America great again. And this is an attempt to make Kavanaugh to be some evil force, which is totally false.
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:58.000]  It's an attempt to make one more attack on the movement to make America great again. And it doesn't matter what your race, your religion, your sexual orientation, your age, your status as an American.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  And that's why they're trying to silence you. And by the way, they're going to fail. It's all smoke and mirrors.
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  Well, I know so far they failed, but the problem is every time they fail, they just ratchet the attack up. But I'm ready to go wherever it goes.
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:21.000]  It's just it's extremely criminal, it's extremely organized, and it's extremely dangerous. God bless you, Donald. I appreciate your call.
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:30.000]  Okay, up next here is Stephanie. And we're going to go to Cynthia and others. Stephanie from Texas. Thank you for calling. Welcome.
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  Hi, Alex. I love you so much.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:33.000]  Love you too.
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:46.000]  The thing is, okay, so I'm going to be really fast. I bought the X2. It's amazing. It helps with all kinds of things that you wouldn't think it would even help with. And it's amazing. So I appreciate your product.
[02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:59.000]  Well, just to interrupt, folks, just just try real iodine, real X2 for yourself. It's our last run of it. Discover why there's an iodine conspiracy. But sorry, go ahead.
[02:10:59.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  Yeah, I have like a thyroid issue. And so that's why I've always studied iodine. And you're 100% right. The nascent iodine is completely different. It's amazing. And I just absolutely I need to buy like 10 more bottles so I can stock up.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  But the other thing too is, you are amazing. You're always 20 years ahead. It really bothers me when people try to, you know, the people that have had fluoride poisoning their whole lives can't think for themselves. You talk the way I would talk if I was talking to a friend.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:41.000]  You know, your filter isn't really there, but you are amazing. You're the news, the things that you're willing to say. It's a very, you're very amazing.
[02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:51.000]  Well, you're amazing. I mean, seriously, it's the audience. They want me shut down because I've read their own documents. They're public. They don't want us together. They don't want us talking. They don't want us getting validation.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:12:07.000]  They don't want us to know that we have a community. They want us to be alone. And they don't want minorities who are the majority now to see the Tea Party loving everybody and to see record numbers of blacks, Hispanics, women being elected as conservatives because they're smart and beautiful and wonderful.
[02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:18.000]  And we're all one team. And that's why they're scared. Double the number of blacks becoming Trump supporters. Double the number of Hispanics in the last year. Didn't happen the first year of Trump. It's happening the last 10 months.
[02:12:18.000 --> 02:12:22.000]  There's a landslide of awakening happening.
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:41.000]  I have actually, I'm proud. I thought, well, it's like you say, if you can just wake up one person. And so I have woken up some minority friends because it's whenever you try to have a conversation, intelligent conversation with people that have their strong opinions that are wrong, they never have any research to back it up.
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  They're going by what they heard on, you know, crazy news and whatnot. And the thing is with the shadow banning, I have had, I've been a blogger for 10 years. I have seen what they do. And basically you, you've always had to pay, you know, to get to the top of the queue.
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:15.000]  They never just be, because I would always wonder, why are the people with the crappy content at the top? Well, they paid, you know, they paid in one form or another. They, they, you know, inched forward. And so I've seen already, I posted a pro-Trump thing on Facebook and I got one of my pages taken away.
[02:13:15.000 --> 02:13:26.000]  And I had to go through all these hoops and get legal documents notarized just to get my page back that I've had for 10 years. And it happened right after I posted this really cool pro-Trump video.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  But back to you.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  No, but that's it. They're doing it to everyone and then denying they're doing it when their own internal documents and videos and lawsuits have them going, we hate all veterans and we hate all rednecks and we hate all people with American flags and we really hate Alex Jones.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:46.000]  Those are, I mean, it's like, what type of crazy people are these?
[02:13:46.000 --> 02:13:57.000]  Well, I'm the only people that don't get it or the ones that care nothing except for like puppy videos and, you know, stuff like that. They don't get it because they're already not awake.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:15.000]  And so you will, you know, when I try to talk to people, sometimes I'm just like, oh God, what's the point? Because you cluelessness, you know, and you could be talking to a filthy rich person that's a doctor, you know, or, and it's like, my God, you don't have any, you know, sometimes I really try to pick people's brains and see where they're at.
[02:14:15.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  There's nothing there.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:22.000]  Well, let me ask you this, Stephanie, the time we have left, you also had a comment on Ford and her believability.
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:39.000]  Okay, so reading people is my thing. I am telling you the baby voice, the, I sat there with an open mind watching it. And by the time that he spoke and he got to come back the next day or whenever it was, I cried, I cry over nothing.
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:55.000]  I'm a strong woman. I'm 49. And I cried because I can read his body language, his tone, his everything. And with research I've done from people that do body language reading, their, their, their thing is exactly what I say.
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:15:04.000]  She's lying. She's manipulating. When I, it happened to me, you know, several times at one time at work, it was pretty severe and weird and creepy.
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:16.000]  If somebody's attracted to me, that's great. And you hit on me, but I'm not interested. That's one thing. But when it's creepy guy, you know, rubbing himself up against you and holding you down against your will, which is what happened to me at work.
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  I immediately told, I quit, you know, but I was so shocked. Within the first six months, I cannot tell the owner of the company. And I had a meeting with the owner of the company five minutes after this happened to me because it was already scheduled.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  So this is an 80 year old Asian man. I, at 32, did not have the guts to write that minute, speak for myself and say, oh my God, your number one man from corporate just rubbed himself all over me and held me down in the back.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:51.000]  I couldn't do it. But six months. And I told other people at work so they would be aware. I'd already known about his.
[02:15:51.000 --> 02:15:54.000]  Hold on. I want to hear about, I want to hear your final point as we come back.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:16:06.000]  It's a no brainer. A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period. You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?

[02:16:25.000 --> 02:16:35.000]  Hear that? That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place. And what they don't steal will be destroyed.

[02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:28.000]  Okay, so Stephanie, I'm looking up here on the calling board and it says, holding. Final point on assaults. You're saying you've been sexually assaulted twice before.
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:40.000]  I don't want to get any details, but I've had family that's been sexually assaulted one time back in college. Somebody came in with a knife and actually, you know, a-raped someone that I know.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:45.000]  I'll just leave it at that. So I know this goes on. I have three daughters. It horrifies me.
[02:20:45.000 --> 02:20:52.000]  But America, statistically, has pretty low levels of this compared to third-world countries, Asia, Latin America.
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  All these other countries, they kill gay people. And I'm always thinking about how we're so mean to everybody here.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:21:00.000]  And I'm just sick of all these special interests bullying everybody.
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:11.000]  And then 36 years later, with no witnesses and no cooperation, and then her whole family's CIA and she's in a mind-control program herself and writes papers.
[02:21:11.000 --> 02:21:17.000]  I'm not kidding, folks, we just tuned in. Storiesoninfullwars.com about how to implant false memories.
[02:21:17.000 --> 02:21:23.000]  I mean, just the craziest stuff and just none of it has credibility. How they waited the 11th hour, all of it.
[02:21:23.000 --> 02:21:38.000]  But getting back to you, give us the juxtaposition, how this ties into cabin on, why it's said on the board that you didn't believe Ms. Ford, Dr. Ford, yourself being a victim of this, why it wasn't congruent for you.
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:54.000]  Because if she is truly a person with psychological training, she would have known that to heal herself, she sort of screamed from the highest rooftop 10 years ago, 15 years ago, something other than now.
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:22:08.000]  But also when she was saying, didn't have answers, nothing was fluid, her posing became different, she became pretty posed, cute and small, and baby voice.
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:18.000]  When I'm telling someone that I want you to know that I'm telling you the truth, I look you straight in the eye, I speak with an adult voice and I tell you the truth.
[02:22:18.000 --> 02:22:26.000]  The thing is that she acted real baby-ish at points that would act all nice and giggly at others. I mean, to me, the whole thing came off very contrived.
[02:22:26.000 --> 02:22:40.000]  Yeah, and some of the words, the wording that she used was very juvenile and she would use some of the diction that young girls use, like I can't remember exact words, but it was, the words were not, they were very baby.
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:55.000]  They were very young, we are 15 again, they are boys, the boys came in, bullshit. But anyway, here's my thing, there should be a statute of limitations for children, victims of abuse, they should be maybe 30, I think I've heard somebody say that before.
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:23:07.000]  But when you are an adult, you need to, what I did was I woke up, four months later I found out that the man at my job that assaulted me and I left a very good job because of it.
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:20.000]  Because he was always creepy making me feel creepy and then finally he did his thing. But the thing is, I called the owner's nephew who I had worked closely with and I said, let me explain something to you.
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:30.000]  I want nothing, I'm asking for nothing, I need nothing except for you to know that this happened and I need you to tell the owner of the company, your uncle.
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:38.000]  And I sat there, he let me talk for an hour and a half and rant about the particulars of exactly what he did to me, what day it was, what I was doing.
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000]  Sure, what happened?
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:51.000]  Well, they took him out of store, this was retail. They took him out of stores and they made him start, he was not allowed to go in stores anymore to this day, he still has his job.
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:57.000]  But my point is, I let all the other women know in the pathway that we're still working there when I left.
[02:23:57.000 --> 02:24:03.000]  Sure, so you did the right thing, you protected people from it. Thank you so much for the call. I would just get rid of somebody that did that.
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:12.000]  But it shows that these Catholic priests, the last little kids, they then sent them to another parish. It's like under the rug, under the rug, and I think that's what angers a lot of people.
[02:24:12.000 --> 02:24:16.000]  And then the left prays upon that to basically rub salt on the women, thanks for the call.
[02:24:16.000 --> 02:24:22.000]  Okay, Cynthia in Washington DC, you're on the air, welcome to the airwaves, go ahead.
[02:24:22.000 --> 02:24:28.000]  Hello, Alex. I'm Cynthia Farhat, I'm an Egyptian immigrant to the US.
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  And I want to tell you that I'm extremely sorry for your persecution.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  And what happened to you, although I wasn't following in full wars before your banning and censorship, it awakened a very, very dark part of my life when I was in Egypt and I founded the political party that was standing for individual freedom and separation of
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:58.000]  Moscow state. And I was starting to write in newspapers and mainstream ones and my articles were getting popular.
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  And I got banned and the Egyptian government even said that my name was not allowed to be mentioned, even to criticize me. I was completely unpersoned.
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:15.000]  Oh, yeah. And that's not happening to me where they say don't even say his name and Americans are like, yes, we won't.
[02:25:15.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  Just getting in line very, very quickly.
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:31.000]  It's horrific. It's horrific, Alex. And then I co-authored a book criticizing Egyptian blasphemy laws, and it was banned by the Islamic al-Aqsa University in Cairo.
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:36.000]  And I was completely unpersoned. I was getting 10 to 50 death threats a day.
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:49.000]  And then this happened and then I came to America and in 2015 the tide turned and it remains through Egyptian newspapers told me you want you to write on ways to counter Islamic terrorism.
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  And now my columns, I get zero censorship. They don't even edit my typos. They publish everything that I write exactly the way I wrote it.
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:02.000]  Cynthia, I think I've heard of you.
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  Right.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  What's your full name? You should come on as a guest.
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:11.000]  Cynthia Farahat. I'm specializing in Islamic terrorism and the Muslim Brotherhood.
[02:26:11.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  No, I remember. And then you got banned and had to leave because of Obama and the Arab Spring, but then after those terrorists were taken out that they brought free speech back. That's good news.
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  They brought it back. Zero censorship because you know why, Alex? Because you are, this will happen to you too because you're a patriot.
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:39.000]  I might disagree with things that you say, but at the end of the day, you're a patriot. You are on the right side of history because you are for individual freedom for live and live.
[02:26:39.000 --> 02:26:46.000]  Oh yeah, they just put your picture up. I've seen you all over national TV. You're also a very beautiful, not just a great writer.
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:58.000]  Thank you, sir. But that's what I wanted to tell you that after they did this to you, I downloaded your app and I said I got to check out what Mr. Jones is saying because we are, we're now fellow travelers.
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  So I downloaded your app and ever since your event, I'd never missed a show of yours because now this is a fight for freedom and a fight for truth and you have supporters across the globe.
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  Well, you're really a famous lady. I mean, you've been all over the news when they banned you and all you were doing was warning about the radical Islamic takeover because Egypt had been one of the more tolerant areas of the Middle East and then Obama obviously backed that violent overthrow.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.000]  Why do you think Obama did that?
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:39.000]  It's, I think it's very, very mysterious. I don't think we'll ever know his exact motivations or reasons, but it's definitely an incredibly shady. It can't be good.
[02:27:39.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  Obama destroyed our country completely and he was backing the Muslim Brotherhood and terrorists and Mrs. Hillary Clinton was also supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and she was aware.
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:28:05.000]  One of her emails, and nobody ever talked about that, by the way, in WikiLeaks, she was aware of a conspiracy between the military and the Brotherhood to mass murder Christians in a specific event.
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  In fact, I knew that. I remember, stay right there. I want to come back Cynthia. You're, you're amazing. And we'll give you our full name as we come back a few more minutes later.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:18.000]  Wow. How cool is it? Open the phones up and have people like this journalist who they have. I remember you barely made it out of the country alive. Didn't you?
[02:28:18.000 --> 02:28:21.000]  Yes, I almost got killed.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  So folks, we talk about Tommy Robinson being a hero or Cynthia being heroes. We haven't gone to that level yet. We don't want to go to that level, but it's getting into that danger zone.
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:39.000]  That's why America is in so much trouble when they tell people don't even say Alex Jones's name now on Google and things unless it's negative. It's very, very dangerous.
[02:28:39.000 --> 02:28:46.000]  We're going to come back with Cynthia here in just a moment from Washington, DC. And then we'll go to all the other callers. Yeah, there she is on Fox News right there.
[02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:51.000]  We'll be right back.

[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:25.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:35.000]  You know, I don't want to go on air and say that Christine Wasi Ford is a CIA mind control operative.
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:45.000]  But she works in a DARPA program and publishes articles on brainwashing on planning false memories on creating classical Manchurian candidates.
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:56.000]  It's not just like she's in some program that's connected to that. And it's like really and the whole family CIA and the brother-in-law and the grandpa and the daddy and the brother.
[02:33:56.000 --> 02:34:00.000]  And it's like it never ends with these people.
[02:34:00.000 --> 02:34:09.000]  It's all these idiots go, I bet Jones is in some intelligence agents here or something. I would be embarrassed to be in some intelligence agency at this point.
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  I've had family that was in the military and was assigned to stuff like that. And they said the New World Order, the World Government's evil.
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:24.000]  It's anti family. It's anti God. It's anti Christian stand against it.
[02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:30.000]  That's what I grew up hearing.
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:34.000]  So it's just insane. We're going to go back to Cynthia.
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:41.000]  Farat is a very famous journalist who called in. We're honored to have her. I want to get her on as an official guest via Skype or in studio.
[02:34:41.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  Very soon as I remember admiring her work, she's been proven totally right about the Islamists and the Arab Spring and Obama funding out of Kenya.
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:51.000]  Now that's all come out. She had to leave the country. They tried to kill her. We'll talk to her in just a minute.
[02:34:51.000 --> 02:34:59.000]  But this is Senator Cornyn just minutes ago during the break. I was watching this live saying that they're not extending in another seven days.
[02:34:59.000 --> 02:35:01.000]  It's all a big plot. Here it is.
[02:35:01.000 --> 02:35:08.000]  It was for seven days, up to seven days for additional supplemental background investigation by the FBI.
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  And as the Georgia leader has said, we will get that.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:23.000]  But now you're starting to hear new arguments being made since they realized that everything the witnesses had previously told the Judiciary Committee under oath under penalty of felony,
[02:35:23.000 --> 02:35:28.000]  they are likely to tell the FBI the same thing. It would make sense to me.
[02:35:28.000 --> 02:35:34.000]  But now they want to focus on Judge Kavanaugh's high school yearbook.
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:48.000]  Give me a break. It just shows the sort of desperation that the other side has to not only deny the nominee a fair and dignified confirmation process,
[02:35:48.000 --> 02:35:51.000]  but to turn this into a three ring circus.
[02:35:51.000 --> 02:36:00.000]  And now we're talking about throwing ice on somebody when you're in college as disqualifying you from a seat on the United States Supreme Court.
[02:36:00.000 --> 02:36:05.000]  This has not been a search for the truth. This has been about search and destroy.
[02:36:05.000 --> 02:36:17.000]  In the process setting up precedent, we will regret for the rest of our lives where an unproven accusation is enough to deny somebody a confirmation in the United States Senate.
[02:36:17.000 --> 02:36:29.000]  And in fact, as Rachel Mitchell pointed out, the confirmation was all in favor of Judge Kavanaugh's position that what was alleged never happened.
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:38.000]  So this is about whether we're going to continue to have a presumption of innocence, due process of law, fairness, listen to both sides.
[02:36:38.000 --> 02:36:54.000]  And that's what's happened so far, but in a way that should never have turned out into the spectacle that it has, primarily because the ranking member sat on the accusation of July 30th creating the circumstance we have now.
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:58.000]  But what we're seeing is just one excuse after another to continue delay.
[02:36:58.000 --> 02:37:07.000]  And that's key right there. They sat on it to then run the clock at the end and then try to delay delay saying there wasn't time.
[02:37:07.000 --> 02:37:16.000]  So that's what they've done. Cynthia Farhat has called him or get her on as an official guest. She's a famous journalist, Cynthia Farhat.com.
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:33.000]  And that's F-A-R-A-H-A-T. She's a famous female reporter who almost got killed reporting on the radical Islamists taking over Egypt and they blew up hundreds of churches and she was getting into the Secretary of State at the time and CNN was promoting it.
[02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:37.000]  All of them. How great this was, the Arab Spring. Google helped push it.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:45.000]  So in hindsight, we know it's 2020. I read your articles on there at the time. You were getting into Hillary and the targeting of Christians. What's the master plan?
[02:37:45.000 --> 02:37:55.000]  Why would you diabolically overthrow some of our longest allies who were being open free societies compared to the Muslim Brotherhood and letting Jews, Christians and women have some basic rights?
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  Why in the world would they do that? And why were they trying to silence you?
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  There's a lot of money involved in promoting terrorism. I was offered a job that would give me close to $700,000 a year just to modify what I'm saying, not even radically change what I'm saying, just to modify it.
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:35.000]  That's very tempting, almost a million dollars a year. And I would get some powerful. I was offered tons of bribes and some people don't have the moral courage to say no to something like that.
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  It can be done for ideological reasons. And I believe former President Barack Obama did it for ideological reasons. I have no evidence and that's why it's only a theory.
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:55.000]  So I believe he supports the Muslim Brotherhood because he is very radical and he does not believe in the American Constitution and the American values.
[02:38:55.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  And unfortunately, this has become very popular right now to hate the Constitution, to hate free speech, to hate individual freedom, to hate patriots and to demonize them and to spread rumors about them and attack them and harass them.
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  So that's why what happened to you gave me nightmares because it brought back all this. They abducted my brother and they made me listen to him getting tortured for me to compromise and I still do not compromise and I will never compromise.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:43.000]  And then he was saved only because I refused to negotiate because I did not negotiate with terrorists. They thought I must be very powerful to be able to do that and they released him and he was home although they hurt him badly and he had three surgeries in his jaws but still he got back home.
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:56.000]  Well, I remember following your story at the time and to see Obama and Hillary, I mean get into the targeting of Christians because I remember that. How many churches, I don't know if the hundreds got blown up and our media was just celebrating how great it was?
[02:39:56.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  Yes, the most conservative number was 72 churches that were attacked and actually I was going to get killed on October 9, 2011 during a protest for religious freedom and I was going with friends of mine.
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:19.000]  I got a fever that day that ended up saving my life because one of my friends was killed their execution style because he was protesting peacefully for religious freedom. That's it.
[02:40:19.000 --> 02:40:25.000]  It was not a single violent, personal violent value we ever advocated for.
[02:40:25.000 --> 02:40:29.000]  Sure, and was it true that Christians were getting crucified?
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:46.000]  No, we did not have any cases of Christians getting crucified but we had Christians death on fire, we had Christians getting killed and Miss Quentin knew that there was a conspiracy to kill Christians in her email, to kill Catholic Christians.
[02:40:46.000 --> 02:40:52.000]  And then after she got that email, she got the email and she read it and she forwarded it to one of her aides.
[02:40:52.000 --> 02:41:03.000]  After she got that brief from Mr. Sidney Blumenthal, she still supported the Muslim Brotherhood fully knowing that they were involved in a genocide against the Christian Christians.
[02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:08.000]  Wow. Well, let me get your info, Cynthia. I'd love to get you on as a guest. Thank you so much for calling in.
[02:41:08.000 --> 02:41:10.000]  Thank you, sir, for having me.
[02:41:10.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  God bless. You know, that's the thing. We had a huge audience of high quality people of every stripe, every color, every religion, every region before.
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:26.000]  But now that they banned us off the social media, it's harder to reach new people.
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:34.000]  But we've gotten a lot of new radio stations and TV stations and the quality of the listeners went from amazing to stratospheric.
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:40.000]  We already have Congress listing, we already have foreign governments listing and intelligence agencies listing because they know we're covering real issues here.
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:49.000]  But man, I mean, the people listing now, I told you, who listens and who calls me and it's all off record.
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:59.000]  But, you know, world leaders, Top Fox News host, a lot of members of Congress, we had a lot before, but this is like Fight Club now.
[02:41:59.000 --> 02:42:06.000]  So you can tell people, your friends and family, hey, Alex Jones are trying to shut him down for a reason. It's the guest, it's the callers, it's the information.
[02:42:06.000 --> 02:42:13.000]  Learn why the system wants infowars.com shut down. Learn what scares them so much.
[02:42:13.000 --> 02:42:20.000]  The truth. I'll play clips of Soros on 60 Minutes saying the best time of his life was serving Hitler and he made happy time.
[02:42:20.000 --> 02:42:25.000]  That's a quote. And then I show the news saying I'm a liar, he never served Hitler.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  I mean, a lot of it's not that fancy. It's just we're willing to tell it like it is.
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:40.000]  So infowars.com, newswars.com, prisonplanet.com, just tell friends and family, hey, don't have to agree with it.
[02:42:40.000 --> 02:42:45.000]  Listen, just see what all the hubbub's about. Newswars.com.
[02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:48.000]  All right, we're going to come back. I'm going to race through calls, I promise.
[02:42:48.000 --> 02:42:55.000]  A whole bunch of them, each caller gets about a minute and a half. We just had so many amazing callers today.

[02:44:48.000 --> 02:45:09.000]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:30.000]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago,
[02:45:30.000 --> 02:45:34.000]  so I get the price down and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done, I'm breaking the contract.
[02:45:34.000 --> 02:45:39.000]  Well, I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially the last run.
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:44.000]  In fact, right now it is the last run of survival shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[02:45:44.000 --> 02:45:49.000]  It'll be gone in a couple of months. X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:52.000]  If you have experienced it, you know how great it is, I suggest you stop up on it.
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:46:15.000]  It's available right now at InfoWarsLife.com right now.
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:29.000]  Now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever that everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter
[02:46:29.000 --> 02:46:37.000]  and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:46:37.000 --> 02:46:45.000]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:46:45.000 --> 02:46:52.000]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:47:21.000]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[02:47:21.000 --> 02:47:28.000]  You know, I love taking calls because the callers bring up things I forgot about or things I didn't know about.
[02:47:28.000 --> 02:47:36.000]  Adam, we're going to go to him in a moment, says, Antifa, Obama's million man army, are they one and the same question mark?
[02:47:36.000 --> 02:47:40.000]  We're going to him second because I want to pull that video in, we haven't played in probably two years.
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:46.000]  Remember when he was candidate Obama? He said, we need a domestic military, just as big, just as strong as our military.
[02:47:46.000 --> 02:47:52.000]  And then it shows the little kids training to be paramilitary fighters against patriots in Chicago.
[02:47:52.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  And yes, the answer is, that's the weatherman race-based race war model that Kanye West and others are fighting against.
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:04.000]  And it's being run by the globalists and it's absolutely dastardly.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:07.000]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[02:48:07.000 --> 02:48:09.000]  And people go, oh, Antifa, they're a bunch of idiots.
[02:48:09.000 --> 02:48:14.000]  They'll be used as the cover patties, as the decoys for the real hit tapes.
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:20.000]  And you see them in the news and all these professors and the top hashtag yesterday, kill Kavanaugh.
[02:48:20.000 --> 02:48:26.000]  And top professors saying they're going to murder him and cut his testicles off and murder his supporters.
[02:48:26.000 --> 02:48:32.000]  It's because we've let these people act like this and engage in criminal activity, they're out of control.
[02:48:32.000 --> 02:48:35.000]  We're talking about that in a moment.
[02:48:35.000 --> 02:48:42.000]  But first, we are ending the 40% off on Brain Force Plus, the amazing Neutropic tomorrow.
[02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  We are ending the 40% off on Secret 12, the highest quality organic vitamin B12 you take under the tongue tomorrow.
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:57.000]  Because supplies of both of those are running very, very low and we're not going to have more shipped until the middle of December.
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  So I'm going to go back to regular price on both those products after tomorrow.
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:05.000]  I had said today was the last day to use PayPal at m4warstore.com.
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  The one there's a protest, dump your wallet out and then delete it.
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:14.000]  I kind of forgotten, I kind of mentioned this last week, we did fall suit on them last night.
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:21.000]  All we're looking is for them to let us go to the lunch counter, get on the bus, get on the airplane, live in America,
[02:49:21.000 --> 02:49:27.000]  and not have them build strawmen about us and then block us from the marketplace.
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:30.000]  So again, we need a lot of money to do this.
[02:49:30.000 --> 02:49:34.000]  We're fighting for everybody's rights here, ladies and gentlemen, m4warstore.com, m4warslife.com.
[02:49:34.000 --> 02:49:39.000]  Sign up for auto-ship and it locks in 10% off on that order in the next.
[02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:41.000]  You can cancel anytime with one click.
[02:49:41.000 --> 02:49:43.000]  Free shipping, order $50 or more.
[02:49:43.000 --> 02:49:50.000]  Every order, even though it's massively discounted, gets 5% Patriot points on each dollar that go on your account.
[02:49:50.000 --> 02:49:53.000]  m4warstore.com has a lot of benefits.
[02:49:53.000 --> 02:49:58.000]  m4warslife.com is the sub area that takes you right to the supplements.
[02:49:58.000 --> 02:50:01.000]  We have the books, the t-shirts, we have the best t-shirts we've ever had.
[02:50:01.000 --> 02:50:04.000]  Trump as a Spartan severing Medusa's head.
[02:50:04.000 --> 02:50:06.000]  Yes, it's Hillary, it's metaphorical.
[02:50:06.000 --> 02:50:08.000]  We don't want to actually cut her head off and make her a martyr.
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:12.000]  We're saying we severed her spiritual evil and now have the head as a weapon.
[02:50:12.000 --> 02:50:14.000]  It's very powerful.
[02:50:14.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  So I guess it's Trump as Perseus.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:22.000]  Though he is wearing a Roman guard traditionally, but it doesn't matter.
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:23.000]  It's awesome.
[02:50:23.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  I just love it.
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:25.000]  It's so obnoxious.
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:26.000]  I wear it out in public.
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:27.000]  It's so cartoonish.
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:31.000]  And then we've got the George Washington French Indian War shirt.
[02:50:31.000 --> 02:50:32.000]  These are some of my favorites.
[02:50:32.000 --> 02:50:33.000]  They're all at m4warstore.com.
[02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:35.000]  We have forbidden information.
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:37.000]  Alex Jones shirt, reelect 45.
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  Meanwhile, like Wolverine, I am the resistance.
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:45.000]  And so much more at m4warstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:48.000]  By the way, most of these shirts are made in America.
[02:50:48.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  They're all printed here.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:50:51.000]  They're really soft fabric.
[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:54.000]  So some of these shirts cost us like $10.
[02:50:54.000 --> 02:50:56.000]  The average is like $8, $9.
[02:50:56.000 --> 02:50:57.000]  I was about to do a shirt.
[02:50:57.000 --> 02:50:58.000]  It was $50 a piece.
[02:50:58.000 --> 02:50:59.000]  We didn't do it.
[02:50:59.000 --> 02:51:00.000]  We went ahead and killed it.
[02:51:00.000 --> 02:51:01.000]  It was too expensive.
[02:51:01.000 --> 02:51:02.000]  If I sell it at 20, we'll go bankrupt.
[02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:05.000]  You have the obnoxious m4war shirt in your face m4war.
[02:51:05.000 --> 02:51:09.000]  It's like this big flaming, almost like, I don't know what color it's.
[02:51:09.000 --> 02:51:10.000]  It's beyond red.
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:11.000]  It really stands out.
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:12.000]  CNN's fake news.
[02:51:12.000 --> 02:51:13.000]  We've got ball caps.
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:16.000]  We have the original shirt I designed 20 years ago.
[02:51:16.000 --> 02:51:17.000]  Mass murderers agree.
[02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.000]  Gun control works.
[02:51:19.000 --> 02:51:20.000]  We've got it all right there.
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:23.000]  The mole on lobby for men and women m4warstore.com.
[02:51:23.000 --> 02:51:28.000]  And we have the new happy's mood and stress.
[02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  All the known concentrated herbs that it's not the presence that just make you calm
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:36.000]  and relaxed and focused at the same time.
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:37.000]  Very powerful formula.
[02:51:37.000 --> 02:51:40.000]  Other leading formulas are 50 bucks.
[02:51:40.000 --> 02:51:42.000]  Ours is normally retail $44.
[02:51:42.000 --> 02:51:44.000]  Well, it's half off out of the gates.
[02:51:44.000 --> 02:51:47.000]  2247 believe me, you can't get a better deal.
[02:51:47.000 --> 02:51:50.000]  Two ounces of it in palm oil.
[02:51:50.000 --> 02:51:51.000]  It's amazing.
[02:51:51.000 --> 02:51:55.000]  These mood and stress are newest product at m4warstore.com.
[02:51:55.000 --> 02:51:57.000]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[02:51:57.000 --> 02:52:00.000]  Matt Bracken's coming up, but I'm going to, and he's good with this.
[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:03.000]  He understands I'm going to commandeer the first two segments.
[02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:04.000]  I get to all of you.
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:09.000]  I will go to every one of these callers or I'll slap myself.
[02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:11.000]  I guess I mean the point is I'm going to try to get all your calls here.
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:13.000]  Who's been home the longest?
[02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:16.000]  Let's go to Josh in Arkansas.
[02:52:16.000 --> 02:52:17.000]  Josh in Arkansas.
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:18.000]  You're on the air.
[02:52:18.000 --> 02:52:19.000]  Welcome.
[02:52:19.000 --> 02:52:22.000]  Hello Alex, how are you doing my friend?
[02:52:22.000 --> 02:52:24.000]  I'm in one hell of a fight brother, but you know what?
[02:52:24.000 --> 02:52:25.000]  I'm counting on you.
[02:52:25.000 --> 02:52:27.000]  You're counting on me and we've already changed the world.
[02:52:27.000 --> 02:52:29.000]  So let's get it done.
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:33.000]  I can tell you that, you know, we're all going through this thing together and it's important
[02:52:33.000 --> 02:52:37.000]  that everybody listen and pay attention to everything that he's saying that it's, you
[02:52:37.000 --> 02:52:41.000]  know, if we don't get informed with everybody that we're in this fight with that we can't
[02:52:41.000 --> 02:52:44.000]  just sit them down and have an argument with the people on the other side because it's
[02:52:44.000 --> 02:52:48.000]  obvious that they're being pushed propaganda that gives them alternative things that the
[02:52:48.000 --> 02:52:51.000]  post on the Facebook, you've got to get in their face.
[02:52:51.000 --> 02:52:56.000]  Just, you know, take for instance, they think that they've put the back and you asked number
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:59.000]  17646 is the overturned row.
[02:52:59.000 --> 02:53:04.000]  And it's all about they think that the stakes and the separate sovereignty is exceptional
[02:53:04.000 --> 02:53:05.000]  to the double jeopardy law.
[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:09.000]  So I mean, what do you think about that with them trying to keep Kavanaugh out of office
[02:53:09.000 --> 02:53:14.000]  and to delay it for so long just so this docket can get past, get past the Senate?
[02:53:14.000 --> 02:53:15.000]  I totally agree.
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:21.000]  They've got stuff stuck in the Supreme Court that they think they have the votes for right
[02:53:21.000 --> 02:53:24.000]  now that'll help them bring us into global government and block Trump.
[02:53:24.000 --> 02:53:29.000]  And Kavanaugh is a strict constructionist and that's why they're scared of him.
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:34.000]  And absolutely, we need Kavanaugh in there right now because he has already told Trump
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000]  he will execute Trump's operation.
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:41.000]  They feel that Trump can pardon all the lot of them that they have nothing to fear from
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:42.000]  the state attorney, right?
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:46.000]  So in reality, they don't want to see the people that Obama pardoned at the end of his
[02:53:46.000 --> 02:53:50.000]  term when he turned loose all those cocaine dealers.
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:51.000]  No, you're right.
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:53.000]  Kavanaugh is a strict constructionist.
[02:53:53.000 --> 02:53:55.000]  He believes in the unitary executive.
[02:53:55.000 --> 02:54:00.000]  He almost goes too far, but I agree the executive is his co-equal in emergencies more than equal.
[02:54:00.000 --> 02:54:05.000]  And he has said that he supports the executive pardoning whoever he wants, including himself.
[02:54:05.000 --> 02:54:07.000]  And again, it's all the voters.
[02:54:07.000 --> 02:54:08.000]  We put them in.
[02:54:08.000 --> 02:54:09.000]  That's the ultimate veto is the impeachment.
[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:10.000]  So barring impeachment.
[02:54:10.000 --> 02:54:18.000]  We used to be able to blame the baby boomers for all of the political stuff and the troubles
[02:54:18.000 --> 02:54:20.000]  that we have, but now we have ourselves to blame.
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:23.000]  So it's important that everybody gets out and starts us.
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:24.000]  Exactly.
[02:54:24.000 --> 02:54:28.000]  The president cannot be a dictator as long as we elect him or as long as the Congress is
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:29.000]  there to impeach him.
[02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:31.000]  And he's been given all these extra powers.
[02:54:31.000 --> 02:54:33.000]  He's using them to give the power back to us.
[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:35.000]  Trump doesn't want to be a dictator, like they say.
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:40.000]  He's destroying the executive power they gave him that's unconstitutional.
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:41.000]  Great points, Josh.
[02:54:41.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  Let's go to another caller here.
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:47.000]  And these idiots, I'm not mad at them, but I shouldn't call them idiots because a few
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000]  of them are my friends, Jason Burmus.
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:53.000]  I watched like five minutes of the video of him going, Alex Jones wants martial law and
[02:54:53.000 --> 02:54:55.000]  tanks driving up down the street.
[02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:56.000]  Jason, I didn't say that.
[02:54:56.000 --> 02:55:01.000]  I said, we're already under martial law that Obama put in place with executive orders and
[02:55:01.000 --> 02:55:03.000]  his people are operating under those.
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:07.000]  That's what Trump hasn't figured out yet, why these groups are in mutiny.
[02:55:07.000 --> 02:55:12.000]  Trump needs to declare his own emergency to nullify the last emergency.
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:17.000]  Before they do a 25th amendment, which even CNN admits is political Armageddon.
[02:55:17.000 --> 02:55:19.000]  It's Antifa wants war on the streets.
[02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:21.000]  It's the liberal professors saying kill conservatives.
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:24.000]  They're the ones saying burn down the cities.
[02:55:24.000 --> 02:55:26.000]  They're the ones saying civil emergency.
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:29.000]  I'm saying we have to treat the emergency they're creating like it is.
[02:55:29.000 --> 02:55:34.000]  And if we let them launch this emergency, we're going to be in an emergency and they're not
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:35.000]  going to be following the law.
[02:55:35.000 --> 02:55:39.000]  So what are we going to do once it's the law of the jungle?
[02:55:39.000 --> 02:55:43.000]  You know, it's like somebody saying, I don't want to get in a fight.
[02:55:43.000 --> 02:55:47.000]  Somebody punches you right in the nose and you go, well, I'm not going to get in a fight.
[02:55:47.000 --> 02:55:49.000]  You're already in a fight.
[02:55:49.000 --> 02:55:53.000]  See, I'm ranting now.
[02:55:53.000 --> 02:55:58.000]  I made it so clear in those shows I did that I don't want full martial law, which means
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:00.000]  tanks on the street and line of people up shooting them.
[02:56:00.000 --> 02:56:01.000]  They already want that.
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:03.000]  They've said they want that.
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:07.000]  They say they're under a civil emergency Obama put in place to shut down independent media.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:12.000]  And he signed the executive orders and they had hearings about it to shut me down.
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:15.000]  I'm experiencing martial law.
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:18.000]  It just means not following the Constitution Bill of Rights.
[02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:21.000]  What do you think it is when all the big tech companies working unison to ban me and now
[02:56:21.000 --> 02:56:25.000]  they're trying to take our banking and they've got Soros suing me?
[02:56:25.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  What do you think that is?
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:29.000]  That is extra judicial garbage.
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:36.000]  So all I'm saying is if the Democrats start rioting and burning cities and they bring
[02:56:36.000 --> 02:56:38.000]  in a civil emergency, they've said they already want.
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:40.000]  And they're trying to burn up the White House.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.000]  It's not martial law.
[02:56:42.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  If the president calls out the military to protect the White House, it's the military
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:50.000]  protecting us from chai, calm, global, funded enemies that have already staged an emergency.
[02:56:50.000 --> 02:56:56.000]  So I'm saying we better start getting used to the thought of what we're going to do.
[02:56:56.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  It's like police.
[02:56:57.000 --> 02:57:02.000]  They have a threat force continuum, a force continuum of you do this, they do that and
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:05.000]  it goes up, up, up, up, up to the point of you pull a gun.
[02:57:05.000 --> 02:57:07.000]  They pull a gun and shoot you.
[02:57:07.000 --> 02:57:09.000]  And so I don't want cops to pull guns and shoot people.
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:12.000]  I don't want to pull guns if Antifa comes to my house.
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:16.000]  I don't want any of this, but Antifa says they're going to come to members of Congress
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:20.000]  in ICE's house and kill them.
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:25.000]  The members of Congress that have been targeted in ICE need to take it and expect that they're coming.
[02:57:25.000 --> 02:57:26.000]  You understand?
[02:57:26.000 --> 02:57:30.000]  And then when you blow their ass off, they're going to call you a tyrant and call it martial law.
[02:57:30.000 --> 02:57:34.000]  Hey, you're the ones opening the door to the bull, dumbasses.
[02:57:34.000 --> 02:57:39.000]  I'm not looking for any trouble, but if you're looking for a fight, you came to the right place
[02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:42.000]  because I'm not backing down to any of you people.
[02:57:42.000 --> 02:57:45.000]  The only thing I'm backing down to is God and God's will.
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:49.000]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym
[02:57:49.000 --> 02:57:53.000]  or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:57:53.000 --> 02:57:59.000]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:57:59.000 --> 02:58:05.000]  But thanks to SupermailVitality at infowarstore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:58:05.000 --> 02:58:10.000]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals
[02:58:10.000 --> 02:58:15.000]  and the food and water to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours
[02:58:15.000 --> 02:58:21.000]  to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park
[02:58:21.000 --> 02:58:25.000]  and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:29.000]  So go to infowarstore.com and get SupermailVitality before it's gone.

[03:00:05.000 --> 03:00:16.000]  Breacher Man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River, she's a gold grime.
[03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:19.000]  The interest is up and the stock market's down.
[03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:24.000]  Cynthia, for a hot, beautiful, smart, courageous woman, her brother was tortured.
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:26.000]  They tried to kill her. She lives in the U.S. now.
[03:00:26.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  She exposed the mother and brother of the whole Islamic Taylor plan.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:32.000]  She called in today. We confirmed it's her. She's going to be a guest next week.
[03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:36.000]  She talked about, hey, don't worry, I got totally banned in Egypt.
[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:39.000]  But once Patriots got back in control, now I'm in all the major papers.
[03:00:39.000 --> 03:00:43.000]  They don't censor a damn word I say, including typos.
[03:00:43.000 --> 03:00:49.000]  So that's exciting. By the way, Trump's responded again to Infowars Banning.
[03:00:49.000 --> 03:00:52.000]  He's going to give him one more chance before he drops the mega hammer on him,
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  because he's got the reports in his hands.
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:59.000]  Trump meet with Google CEO, social media companies later this month.
[03:00:59.000 --> 03:01:04.000]  He said, I won't mention any names, but when they take certain people off Twitter
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:08.000]  or Facebook and they're making that decision, it's really dangerous
[03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:12.000]  that because that could be anyone tomorrow, Trump said.
[03:01:12.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  So when I had law firms write up reports for him seven weeks ago,
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:21.000]  that's when they decided to ban me. They went eight,
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:25.000]  when our reports from top law firms got to the president.
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:29.000]  And I gave them all examples of what they were doing.
[03:01:29.000 --> 03:01:31.000]  And we need to keep doing that because they're going to stonewall,
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:33.000]  but it's out of control.
[03:01:33.000 --> 03:01:35.000]  Matt Bracken's coming up in about 15 minutes,
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:37.000]  former Navy SEAL best selling author, great researcher.
[03:01:37.000 --> 03:01:39.000]  He'll have a ton of information for you.
[03:01:39.000 --> 03:01:41.000]  We're going to your calls right now.
[03:01:41.000 --> 03:01:43.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Adam.
[03:01:43.000 --> 03:01:45.000]  Now, I'll do Adam in Texas next segment.
[03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:48.000]  I have plenty of time for him because I have the clip now about what he's talking about
[03:01:48.000 --> 03:01:51.000]  and how Antifa is Obama's million man army.
[03:01:51.000 --> 03:01:53.000]  So we'll go to that in a moment.
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:01:55.000]  Let's go to Chris in Illinois. You're on the air.
[03:01:55.000 --> 03:01:57.000]  Thanks for holding Chris.
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:01:59.000]  Hey, Alex. Good afternoon.
[03:01:59.000 --> 03:02:01.000]  Welcome.
[03:02:01.000 --> 03:02:04.000]  So, you know, all over the ground here in Chicago,
[03:02:04.000 --> 03:02:08.000]  I especially food wrap and business has never been better.
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000]  Thanks to Trump, man.
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  I mean, there's places opening up all over the place.
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:15.000]  Anyway, so, you know, with this Kavanaugh thing,
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  I was my wife's a social worker.
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:19.000]  She's not very conservative, but I'm telling you,
[03:02:19.000 --> 03:02:21.000]  she's at our width end with this and she's pissed.
[03:02:21.000 --> 03:02:23.000]  And a lot of her friends are pissed.
[03:02:23.000 --> 03:02:27.000]  And I've never seen her so like she doesn't get on Facebook
[03:02:27.000 --> 03:02:29.000]  and comment back to people.
[03:02:29.000 --> 03:02:31.000]  But she's getting it. She called me today and she's like,
[03:02:31.000 --> 03:02:33.000]  Chris, what should I say?
[03:02:33.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  Oh, I know, I know women that are more kind of libertarian liberal
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:40.000]  and they're all pissed about Kavanaugh and don't believe any of this.
[03:02:40.000 --> 03:02:43.000]  In fact, I'm not saying that to say, oh, look, there's a woman wave.
[03:02:43.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  Women I know particularly in family, you name it,
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:49.000]  do not buy a damn thing. She says,
[03:02:49.000 --> 03:02:52.000]  has your wife told you why?
[03:02:52.000 --> 03:02:56.000]  Well, she, you know, she's responded to one of her friends today
[03:02:56.000 --> 03:02:59.000]  and she said, yeah, the women, the women, the women.
[03:02:59.000 --> 03:03:01.000]  But she said, what about my son?
[03:03:01.000 --> 03:03:05.000]  My son is going to be accused by a girl of just about anything
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:07.000]  and never be able to refute it.
[03:03:07.000 --> 03:03:09.000]  I mean, she was literally in tears, Alex.
[03:03:09.000 --> 03:03:12.000]  And, you know, and then I kind of correlated it
[03:03:12.000 --> 03:03:14.000]  because I'm a little more hardcore.
[03:03:14.000 --> 03:03:17.000]  You know, I've been writing papers about this stuff since college,
[03:03:17.000 --> 03:03:20.000]  you know, skull and bones and the bushes
[03:03:20.000 --> 03:03:22.000]  and all the Nazi crap and all that.
[03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:25.000]  But anyway, you know, I told her, said, Jill, there's a reason
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:27.000]  why they act maniacal like this.
[03:03:27.000 --> 03:03:33.000]  The reason you cannot reason with them is this is demonic.
[03:03:33.000 --> 03:03:36.000]  You know, this is about their sacrament to death
[03:03:36.000 --> 03:03:38.000]  and the blood of the unborn.
[03:03:38.000 --> 03:03:40.000]  Exactly. They don't even know it.
[03:03:40.000 --> 03:03:42.000]  It is a spiritual thing with the left.
[03:03:42.000 --> 03:03:45.000]  When you finally come to grips, because I've got to hear army colonels
[03:03:45.000 --> 03:03:50.000]  and three-star generals at dinner and FBI guys when I was like 20,
[03:03:50.000 --> 03:03:53.000]  you know, going to meetings and hearing about the New World Order
[03:03:53.000 --> 03:03:55.000]  and they'd be like, well, at the end of the day,
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:57.000]  they're devil worshipers and pedophiles.
[03:03:57.000 --> 03:03:59.000]  And I'd be like, these guys are crazy.
[03:03:59.000 --> 03:04:03.000]  And then I started researching it and it's all true.
[03:04:03.000 --> 03:04:08.000]  Well, and the thing is, I think the flow,
[03:04:08.000 --> 03:04:10.000]  fully people are awakening.
[03:04:10.000 --> 03:04:13.000]  And I think the most shocking things are yet to come.
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  You know, Alex, what I do, the most effective,
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:16.000]  so I'm in sales, right?
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:18.000]  So my job's to sell you.
[03:04:18.000 --> 03:04:21.000]  So I work with people and, you know, I was out with co-workers
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:23.000]  and they're like, Alex, Jill, this, Alex, that.
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:26.000]  And I said, can you specifically name why you don't like him?
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:27.000]  They can't, you know.
[03:04:27.000 --> 03:04:29.000]  And then when we get into these conversations,
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:31.000]  I just go back to the basics.
[03:04:31.000 --> 03:04:32.000]  I go back, I just lay it out.
[03:04:32.000 --> 03:04:36.000]  I say, you know, have you ever heard of Operation Cyclone?
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:37.000]  I'll bring that up.
[03:04:37.000 --> 03:04:40.000]  You know, we started, we create our own problems,
[03:04:40.000 --> 03:04:42.000]  our imperialism, this type of thing.
[03:04:42.000 --> 03:04:45.000]  You should lay out the basics of these...
[03:04:45.000 --> 03:04:47.000]  Oh, they're just stunned, exactly.
[03:04:47.000 --> 03:04:49.000]  And Operation Cyclone was the whole fake thing to stop Trump
[03:04:49.000 --> 03:04:51.000]  and set him up for Russiagate by Obama.
[03:04:51.000 --> 03:04:52.000]  Great points.
[03:04:52.000 --> 03:05:21.000]  God bless you, Chris.
[03:05:22.000 --> 03:05:51.000]  Thank you.
[03:05:52.000 --> 03:06:21.000]  You know, people ask me why I'm in leftist Austin.
[03:06:21.000 --> 03:06:26.000]  Well, because my family's been here since it was Waterloo, 1820,
[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:30.000]  when it was Mexico, Spanish land grants on both sides of the family.
[03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:32.000]  In fact, I'm the first generation to marry women
[03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:34.000]  whose families don't go back to the beginning of Texas.
[03:06:34.000 --> 03:06:36.000]  It's the craziest family tree.
[03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:40.000]  And Colonel Travis's son ended up dying without children,
[03:06:40.000 --> 03:06:43.000]  but my family was the spiritual parents of Travis.
[03:06:43.000 --> 03:06:44.000]  They raised him.
[03:06:44.000 --> 03:06:47.000]  A famous letter was written to my ancestors.
[03:06:47.000 --> 03:06:51.000]  And so people ask why I haven't evacuated central Texas.
[03:06:51.000 --> 03:06:55.000]  Look, the globalists left in Google and Facebook only have downtown.
[03:06:55.000 --> 03:06:58.000]  Everybody else is libertarian or conservative.
[03:06:58.000 --> 03:07:01.000]  But California is collapsing and they are invading here.
[03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:03.000]  And that's their real invasion force.
[03:07:03.000 --> 03:07:06.000]  Their real army are their zombies that, like,
[03:07:06.000 --> 03:07:09.000]  carrion crows or, like, locust,
[03:07:09.000 --> 03:07:13.000]  eat the flesh off our bones and fly on to the next state or city.
[03:07:13.000 --> 03:07:14.000]  We're gonna go to some more of your calls,
[03:07:14.000 --> 03:07:15.000]  and Matt Bracken's taken over.
[03:07:15.000 --> 03:07:18.000]  He's loaded for bear, but a caller, Adam,
[03:07:18.000 --> 03:07:21.000]  was saying Obama's million-man army, one and the same.
[03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:25.000]  And I'd forgotten candidate Obama, Senator Obama,
[03:07:25.000 --> 03:07:30.000]  said we need a domestic military just as big and just as strong.
[03:07:30.000 --> 03:07:32.000]  And the weathermen, that was one of their ideas,
[03:07:32.000 --> 03:07:34.000]  was to have these paramilitary forces.
[03:07:34.000 --> 03:07:36.000]  Well, that's actually what Antifa has become.
[03:07:36.000 --> 03:07:40.000]  So here's the president, former president, 10 years ago.
[03:07:40.000 --> 03:07:44.000]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military
[03:07:44.000 --> 03:07:48.000]  in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[03:07:48.000 --> 03:07:51.000]  We've got to have a civilian national security force
[03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:56.000]  that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:07:56.000 --> 03:08:02.000]  Now, we'll go to the caller, but Antifa are the kill teams.
[03:08:02.000 --> 03:08:03.000]  They're now calling for kill teams.
[03:08:03.000 --> 03:08:05.000]  They're now all over Facebook, Twitter,
[03:08:05.000 --> 03:08:08.000]  saying kill the people at the restaurant that serve crews.
[03:08:08.000 --> 03:08:10.000]  Kill everybody.
[03:08:10.000 --> 03:08:14.000]  And all I'm pointing out is if they think they lose the election,
[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:15.000]  that's when they do this.
[03:08:15.000 --> 03:08:18.000]  Matt Bracken will cover this after he takes over in a moment.
[03:08:18.000 --> 03:08:24.000]  But don't think that they're not the cover for the real paramilitaries
[03:08:24.000 --> 03:08:28.000]  that Obama is allied with, MS-13 and even Hezbollah.
[03:08:28.000 --> 03:08:31.000]  Yes, the left is allied with both groups from my intel.
[03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:32.000]  Matt can disagree or agree.
[03:08:32.000 --> 03:08:34.000]  We'll see what he says when he takes over.
[03:08:34.000 --> 03:08:36.000]  But Adam, go ahead and bring up your point.
[03:08:36.000 --> 03:08:37.000]  Thanks for calling from Texas.
[03:08:37.000 --> 03:08:39.000]  Hey, Mr. Jones, can you hear me?
[03:08:39.000 --> 03:08:40.000]  Yes, sir. Go ahead.
[03:08:40.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  All right. Yeah.
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:44.000]  You know, this past Saturday, I was really thinking about this whole
[03:08:44.000 --> 03:08:45.000]  Antifa thing.
[03:08:45.000 --> 03:08:49.000]  And then it registered that when Obama was fixing to get into office,
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:52.000]  he mentioned that clip that you just played.
[03:08:52.000 --> 03:08:54.000]  And it was kind of swept out of the road.
[03:08:54.000 --> 03:08:55.000]  Nothing has been done.
[03:08:55.000 --> 03:09:01.000]  So I started doing my research and he was telling certain people
[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:07.000]  that he would get professors to be the general for this underground army
[03:09:07.000 --> 03:09:09.000]  that he was going to create.
[03:09:09.000 --> 03:09:11.000]  And it all started coming together.
[03:09:11.000 --> 03:09:14.000]  It's just mind blowing that no one else is really talking about it
[03:09:14.000 --> 03:09:16.000]  because we've kind of forgot.
[03:09:16.000 --> 03:09:19.000]  But I wanted to get y'all's take and y'all's opinion on this.
[03:09:19.000 --> 03:09:20.000]  What's everyone's thought?
[03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:25.000]  Well, we got documents in January of this year, now 10 months ago,
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:29.000]  that George Soros' son, Alexander Soros, was spending 50-plus million
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:33.000]  just trying to cause riots in East Coast cities.
[03:09:33.000 --> 03:09:37.000]  And Baltimore, Maryland was their main test site with the Blue City police
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:41.000]  actually letting them burn an attack to hope that the general public,
[03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:43.000]  the black Americans, would burn things down.
[03:09:43.000 --> 03:09:47.000]  There's the headline.
[03:09:47.000 --> 03:09:53.000]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[03:09:53.000 --> 03:09:56.000]  Leak documents purport to show to tell plan to trigger nationwide unrest,
[03:09:56.000 --> 03:09:58.000]  allowing Obama to declare martial law.
[03:09:58.000 --> 03:10:01.000]  And the documents were later confirmed to be accurate.
[03:10:01.000 --> 03:10:03.000]  There was no media coverage of the documents,
[03:10:03.000 --> 03:10:07.000]  so they were admitted to be accurate enrollment papers
[03:10:07.000 --> 03:10:10.000]  to carry out the criminal operation.
[03:10:10.000 --> 03:10:13.000]  So they're definitely planning to try something like that.
[03:10:13.000 --> 03:10:16.000]  You know, I think this is why they're also coming after a cabinol
[03:10:16.000 --> 03:10:20.000]  because they're afraid that if we get the Supreme Court back,
[03:10:20.000 --> 03:10:23.000]  when Trump starts going after all of these criminals,
[03:10:23.000 --> 03:10:25.000]  we could prosecute them a lot easier
[03:10:25.000 --> 03:10:28.000]  so they're doing everything they can to block that.
[03:10:28.000 --> 03:10:32.000]  That is exactly what's going on. This country is on a razor's edge.
[03:10:32.000 --> 03:10:35.000]  You know, it's patriots like yourself and all of your listeners.
[03:10:35.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  We are going to be the ones that bring back this country.
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:39.000]  You know, Trump's doing a great job,
[03:10:39.000 --> 03:10:42.000]  but it's time for us to stand up and take back our country.
[03:10:42.000 --> 03:10:45.000]  I agree. Everyone should go to city council, county commissioners,
[03:10:45.000 --> 03:10:46.000]  and talk about this subject.
[03:10:46.000 --> 03:10:49.000]  And PTA, anywhere there's an audience, church,
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:52.000]  it's time to get aggressive in information warfare.
[03:10:52.000 --> 03:10:54.000]  God bless you, Adam.
[03:10:54.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Brandon in Idaho.
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  Brandon, you're on the air. Welcome.
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:00.000]  Hi there, Mr. House.
[03:11:00.000 --> 03:11:03.000]  Jonathan, it's great to finally talk to you about our first-time caller.
[03:11:03.000 --> 03:11:06.000]  Just want to say you and Trump paired together
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:09.000]  have shaken this political system to its core.
[03:11:09.000 --> 03:11:12.000]  And it's a lovely thing to see. I love it.
[03:11:12.000 --> 03:11:14.000]  I love to see when it's being proactive and everything.
[03:11:14.000 --> 03:11:17.000]  And we're praying for you and Trump and, you know,
[03:11:17.000 --> 03:11:19.000]  keeping you guys in our thoughts.
[03:11:19.000 --> 03:11:23.000]  I think Michael Savage said it best that liberalism is a mental disorder.
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:30.000]  And the fact that these colleges have completely brainwashed the younger crowd.
[03:11:30.000 --> 03:11:35.000]  Oh, they've totally radicalized them and crippled these people mentally.
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:38.000]  It's a complete step in their brainwashes.
[03:11:38.000 --> 03:11:41.000]  I was wearing three Halloween's ago, and I don't really go out on Halloween,
[03:11:41.000 --> 03:11:44.000]  but I went to a party. It was my cousin's birthday that day after Halloween.
[03:11:44.000 --> 03:11:48.000]  So he has a party, and I'm wearing a captain's hat.
[03:11:48.000 --> 03:11:53.000]  And I had, like, two white guys and an Arab guy walk over and say,
[03:11:53.000 --> 03:11:57.000]  are you a Nazi because I'm a white guy wearing a black cap,
[03:11:57.000 --> 03:12:00.000]  or a baby blue, or a dark blue captain's hat.
[03:12:00.000 --> 03:12:02.000]  I mean, it's just total mental illness.
[03:12:02.000 --> 03:12:06.000]  And unfortunately, these college kids don't know what Naziism is.
[03:12:06.000 --> 03:12:09.000]  You know, during World War II, everyone was sparing game.
[03:12:09.000 --> 03:12:11.000]  It wasn't just the Jews. It was everybody.
[03:12:11.000 --> 03:12:13.000]  If you were, you know, everyone was sparing game at that point.
[03:12:13.000 --> 03:12:17.000]  My question is to you, though, is, you know, with liberalism being a mental disorder,
[03:12:17.000 --> 03:12:22.000]  how is it that we get these kids, you know, back on the right track mentally?
[03:12:22.000 --> 03:12:25.000]  You know, it's a sad thought to see, you know, them being zombies following,
[03:12:25.000 --> 03:12:28.000]  you know, following the crowds and not thinking on their own.
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:32.000]  What do we do? You know, I see plenty of my friends, co-workers,
[03:12:32.000 --> 03:12:34.000]  and people that I know and talk to.
[03:12:34.000 --> 03:12:37.000]  They're just so, you know, mentally unstable, I guess you would say,
[03:12:37.000 --> 03:12:40.000]  or even the fact that they just, they're not fully there.
[03:12:40.000 --> 03:12:43.000]  They buy into their identity being this victim and this person.
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:46.000]  Like, it's a comic book, and you've got to explain to them
[03:12:46.000 --> 03:12:49.000]  how it's happened and not, in my experience, not even be too nice to them,
[03:12:49.000 --> 03:12:52.000]  but just not even laugh at them and say, listen, this is serious business.
[03:12:52.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  God bless you, Brandon. Great points. Good to hear from you.
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:12:58.000]  We're cramming them in now. David in Iowa. David, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:12:58.000 --> 03:13:00.000]  Thanks for holding.
[03:13:00.000 --> 03:13:02.000]  Yeah, Alex, I had two quick things.
[03:13:02.000 --> 03:13:06.000]  I'd like to have you check that article that Roger Stone wrote
[03:13:06.000 --> 03:13:10.000]  in the Infowars.com titled Cavanaugh is a pick of the deep state.
[03:13:10.000 --> 03:13:15.000]  And he also talks about Cavanaugh being a prosecuting attorney
[03:13:15.000 --> 03:13:18.000]  against a witness at Fort Marcy Park and helping...
[03:13:18.000 --> 03:13:21.000]  No, no, no. I remember when we didn't want Cavanaugh and we wanted Barrett
[03:13:21.000 --> 03:13:24.000]  and we thought it was a better choice, but at least he'll vote with Trump.
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:28.000]  No, no, no, but I mean, you're right. We had problems with Cavanaugh. Go ahead.
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:32.000]  Yeah, I think Mike Lee would be a better choice.
[03:13:32.000 --> 03:13:35.000]  Cavanaugh was not my first choice, but they're really afraid of him
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:39.000]  because he believes in the power of the executive and will back Trump.
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  Yeah. I got one other thing.
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:43.000]  Well, let me say this. If he is so bad,
[03:13:43.000 --> 03:13:46.000]  why is the deep state fighting like they're about to die?
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:51.000]  Well, what do you think, David?
[03:13:51.000 --> 03:13:55.000]  Well, I don't know. You're probably better,
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:13:58.000]  but you should go on through some punishment.
[03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:02.000]  Well, that's the thing. I mean, I don't... Exactly.
[03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:05.000]  Yeah, I got one other quick thing.
[03:14:05.000 --> 03:14:08.000]  We know you need funds for the expansion and all that stuff.
[03:14:08.000 --> 03:14:11.000]  Well, at this point, we just need funds to keep going, but yeah.
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:15.000]  Okay. Last week, I wrote a check for $100 and sent it to you,
[03:14:15.000 --> 03:14:21.000]  and I started thinking, okay, we've got 1 to 3 million people as an audience.
[03:14:21.000 --> 03:14:25.000]  Well, how about if we had a big chunk of people that sent you a check?
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:32.000]  We could call it the $100 Freedom.
[03:14:32.000 --> 03:14:34.000]  Or the $100 Paul Revere. I agree.
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:37.000]  A fraction of our audience buys product or gives donations,
[03:14:37.000 --> 03:14:41.000]  and believe me, 97% of it's going into the fight now. It's all about survival.
[03:14:41.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  So God bless you, David, for the support of the PO Boxes on the website.
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:50.000]  Yes, sir, we need donations. We need support because I'm fighting Soros on every front,
[03:14:50.000 --> 03:14:53.000]  and I believe we're going to win. You know, it's all in God's plan,
[03:14:53.000 --> 03:14:56.000]  but so much of it is up to you guys and what you do,
[03:14:56.000 --> 03:14:58.000]  and I'm not putting it on you. It is you.
[03:14:58.000 --> 03:15:00.000]  So thank you for stepping up, David.
[03:15:00.000 --> 03:15:03.000]  $100 Freedom Injection.
[03:15:03.000 --> 03:15:06.000]  $100 Freedom Injection. God bless you, David.
[03:15:06.000 --> 03:15:10.000]  You know, that's a really good point is about Kavanaugh.
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:13.000]  I came out against Kavanaugh. I mean, I didn't say he's horrible,
[03:15:13.000 --> 03:15:20.000]  but you know, George W. Bush's clerk and buddies with Carl Rove.
[03:15:20.000 --> 03:15:24.000]  But I mean, as bad as Carl Rove is, he's not Hillary Clinton,
[03:15:24.000 --> 03:15:26.000]  and he's not Barack Obama.
[03:15:26.000 --> 03:15:29.000]  And Kavanaugh and people are kind of creatures of who's president.
[03:15:29.000 --> 03:15:34.000]  And all I know is, he has told the president he's going to back him,
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:36.000]  and he's going to back making America great again,
[03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:40.000]  and they are fighting like I've never seen them to keep him out.
[03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:43.000]  And so that tells me that...
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:45.000]  Listen, I would have mattered, like you said,
[03:15:45.000 --> 03:15:48.000]  Lee or Barrett would have been better, better voting records.
[03:15:48.000 --> 03:16:15.000]  But hey, it's a lot better than what we're going to get with Hillary.
[03:16:18.000 --> 03:16:22.000]  That's DanPilla.com, DanPilla.com.
[03:16:49.000 --> 03:16:53.000]  That's 1-877-99-B-E-R-K-E-Y.
[03:16:53.000 --> 03:16:56.000]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my sunshine.
[03:16:56.000 --> 03:16:59.000]  For the best hot or cold pain relief, get the best.
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:01.000]  Get a sunny-bay heating pad.
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:06.000]  Sometimes life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[03:17:06.000 --> 03:17:09.000]  And the best relief for that pain is a sunny-bay heating pad.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:12.000]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians
[03:17:12.000 --> 03:17:15.000]  said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?
[03:17:15.000 --> 03:17:18.000]  Sunny-bay heating pads are handmade with high quality,
[03:17:18.000 --> 03:17:20.000]  can be used at home or at work,
[03:17:20.000 --> 03:17:25.000]  and have a lifetime 100% positive rating on both Amazon and Etsy.
[03:17:25.000 --> 03:17:26.000]  Why take another pill?
[03:17:26.000 --> 03:17:30.000]  Many people use our sunny-bay heating pads alone and got rid of the neck pain.
[03:17:30.000 --> 03:17:33.000]  Long distance travel or long hours in front of a computer
[03:17:33.000 --> 03:17:35.000]  can take its toll on your body.
[03:17:35.000 --> 03:17:38.000]  Our homegrown small business tries to help people just like us.
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:42.000]  That's why we design and test our handmade products with great care
[03:17:42.000 --> 03:17:44.000]  before we introduce them to the public.
[03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:47.000]  You can easily find sunny-bay heating pads on Amazon.
[03:17:47.000 --> 03:17:51.000]  Just go to Amazon.com and search for sunny-bay heating pads.
[03:17:54.000 --> 03:17:59.000]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:17:59.000 --> 03:18:02.000]  InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party,
[03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:05.000]  left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department,
[03:18:05.000 --> 03:18:08.000]  and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:18:08.000 --> 03:18:10.000]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:13.000]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:18:13.000 --> 03:18:16.000]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:18:16.000 --> 03:18:18.000]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:18:18.000 --> 03:18:21.000]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is
[03:18:21.000 --> 03:18:25.000]  and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target,
[03:18:25.000 --> 03:18:27.000]  and if you financially support us,
[03:18:27.000 --> 03:18:31.000]  and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at infowords.com,
[03:18:31.000 --> 03:18:36.000]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags. We'll win.
[03:18:36.000 --> 03:18:39.000]  We have huge sales at infowordsstore.com right now.
[03:18:39.000 --> 03:18:43.000]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you
[03:18:43.000 --> 03:18:46.000]  despite the fact you're trying to block our commerce and you're right to the market.
[03:18:46.000 --> 03:18:50.000]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and the Globalist may win.
[03:18:50.000 --> 03:18:54.000]  This is InfoWords Darker Tower. We're your support. I'm counting on you.
[03:18:54.000 --> 03:18:58.000]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement
[03:18:58.000 --> 03:19:01.000]  that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the InfoWord
[03:19:01.000 --> 03:19:03.000]  to fight the Globalist and live in a free society.
[03:19:03.000 --> 03:19:07.000]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the U.S.
[03:19:07.000 --> 03:19:10.000]  to create the strongest, most concentrated,
[03:19:10.000 --> 03:19:16.000]  over-the-top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula that is safe.
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:19.000]  I know from using this myself the last few months
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:21.000]  and from seeing my friends and family use it
[03:19:21.000 --> 03:19:23.000]  that this new product is going to end up being
[03:19:23.000 --> 03:19:26.000]  the number one best-selling product at infowordslife.com
[03:19:26.000 --> 03:19:29.000]  because it works so well. This is a gift you want to give yourself

[03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:18.000]  All right, Matt Bracken's taking over right now, but Matt,
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:22.000]  we were talking during the break. You get what I'm saying.
[03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:24.000]  They're leading us into civil emergency martial law.
[03:20:24.000 --> 03:20:27.000]  Obama put civil emergencies in place before he left.
[03:20:27.000 --> 03:20:30.000]  I don't want tanks in the streets and all the rest of it.
[03:20:30.000 --> 03:20:34.000]  That's what they want. But what do we do if they trigger the emergency
[03:20:34.000 --> 03:20:38.000]  or how does Trump declare his new emergency to then end the last emergency
[03:20:38.000 --> 03:20:41.000]  because that's how that works in law, just like he ended the TPP.
[03:20:41.000 --> 03:20:45.000]  They call that dictatorial, but that had been done through undue executive power.
[03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:49.000]  Some other people get the nuances. I mean, the general audience does,
[03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:53.000]  but I think some folks out there want to just make points
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:57.000]  by semanically ignoring what I'm actually saying.
[03:20:57.000 --> 03:21:01.000]  Yeah, it requires a lot of nuance and a bigger picture
[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:07.000]  and personally, I feel like throwing around terms like martial law,
[03:21:07.000 --> 03:21:14.000]  it's too easy to clip that out and make a weaponized soundbite against us.
[03:21:14.000 --> 03:21:17.000]  Our audience understands what we mean,
[03:21:17.000 --> 03:21:22.000]  but in the hostile media, it's too easy to say something like
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:27.000]  Alex Jones and Trump are calling for martial law, and that's not it at all.
[03:21:27.000 --> 03:21:31.000]  But absolutely, the left sees the window closing.
[03:21:31.000 --> 03:21:35.000]  They had hoped, and so their hopes have been dashed.
[03:21:35.000 --> 03:21:40.000]  They thought in 2016, Hillary would be president, the deep state victorious,
[03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:43.000]  nobody's ever heard of Peter Strzok or any of these people,
[03:21:43.000 --> 03:21:48.000]  and they go just continue step by step to Obama's fundamental transformation
[03:21:48.000 --> 03:21:51.000]  of the United States. Instead, they got Trump,
[03:21:51.000 --> 03:21:54.000]  and they were really shocked because the polls were all wrong,
[03:21:54.000 --> 03:21:56.000]  as they are, I believe now.
[03:21:56.000 --> 03:22:00.000]  And when they see Kavanaugh coming in as a solid fifth, and remember,
[03:22:00.000 --> 03:22:07.000]  now they've red-pilled him. If he was a squishy moderate Republican supreme before,
[03:22:07.000 --> 03:22:12.000]  I think he's going to be high-fiving Clarence Thomas backstage,
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:16.000]  and they're going to be saying, let's go get these MFers.
[03:22:16.000 --> 03:22:18.000]  It's our turn.
[03:22:18.000 --> 03:22:21.000]  Oh, I totally agree. I like the fact that he got angry,
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:24.000]  because you're getting accused of all this stuff, you're going to get angry.
[03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:28.000]  He's red-pilled now. He's one of us now, I guarantee you.
[03:22:28.000 --> 03:22:30.000]  He's red-pilled against the left.
[03:22:30.000 --> 03:22:35.000]  And now that they see their window closing, meaning,
[03:22:35.000 --> 03:22:38.000]  let's say they don't flip the Senate.
[03:22:38.000 --> 03:22:42.000]  If they flip the Senate, we're screwed, because it'll be Adam Schiff,
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:44.000]  not Devin Nunez running the Intel Committee.
[03:22:44.000 --> 03:22:48.000]  It'll be Feinstein, not Grassley, running the Judiciary Committee.
[03:22:48.000 --> 03:22:50.000]  It'll be full steam ahead for impeachment.
[03:22:50.000 --> 03:22:53.000]  On any flimsy pretext, as we've seen with Kavanaugh,
[03:22:53.000 --> 03:22:59.000]  throwing ice allegedly in a drunken party is grounds for keeping him off the Supreme Court.
[03:22:59.000 --> 03:23:02.000]  And it's another professor. Another liberal professor with no proof.
[03:23:02.000 --> 03:23:04.000]  It's all liberal professors.
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:09.000]  Right. It's all false narrative, because they had a casting call
[03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:15.000]  when they held up Christine Blasey Ford's testimony for a week and a half.
[03:23:15.000 --> 03:23:18.000]  That was the signal for everybody to come out of the woodwork
[03:23:18.000 --> 03:23:24.000]  with any kind of allegation, male or female, drunken parties, rape gangs.
[03:23:24.000 --> 03:23:26.000]  But it hasn't worked.
[03:23:26.000 --> 03:23:31.000]  And all it's done is drive our base crazy.
[03:23:31.000 --> 03:23:38.000]  We're watching the, what do you call them, the flip states, the Senate Democratic senators.
[03:23:38.000 --> 03:23:39.000]  Purple states.
[03:23:39.000 --> 03:23:42.000]  Yeah, the Heidi Heist camp.
[03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:44.000]  These people are in trouble now.
[03:23:44.000 --> 03:23:49.000]  And I think that he's going to be confirmed because a lot of these Democrats.
[03:23:49.000 --> 03:23:52.000]  Well, that's what Senator Cornyn said an hour ago. We played it.
[03:23:52.000 --> 03:23:55.000]  He said, listen, you're going to get the exact same testimony you got here,
[03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:58.000]  because it's all under perjury threat, felony perjury.
[03:23:58.000 --> 03:24:01.000]  And so we're going to have to vote Friday.
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:04.000]  But like you said, the left may drive a truck bomb into the Capitol.
[03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:08.000]  Well, and when, and when they are looking at the midterms, you know,
[03:24:08.000 --> 03:24:12.000]  they've got polling that's propaganda polling, sure, for the, for the morons.
[03:24:12.000 --> 03:24:14.000]  But they know the truth.
[03:24:14.000 --> 03:24:15.000]  Yeah, they know the truth.
[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:21.000]  And if, and what they're going to do out now at the overt, the talking head people that we see on TV,
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:25.000]  they, they're just spewing propaganda for the masses.
[03:24:25.000 --> 03:24:30.000]  But the Bob Kramer activists, you know, the ones that were the go-betweens,
[03:24:30.000 --> 03:24:33.000]  the guy that went into Obama's White House a couple hundred times,
[03:24:33.000 --> 03:24:38.000]  then he's passing out the money to hand to these subgroups that would then pay the crazy thugs
[03:24:38.000 --> 03:24:42.000]  to actually beat people up and cause, cause fights.
[03:24:42.000 --> 03:24:45.000]  Those guys are going to be saying, you know what?
[03:24:45.000 --> 03:24:49.000]  If we're losing the Senate, it's time to take it to the kinetic level.
[03:24:49.000 --> 03:24:53.000]  And instead of just throwing punches at Trump rallies,
[03:24:53.000 --> 03:24:55.000]  I think they're going to be passing out guns.
[03:24:55.000 --> 03:24:56.000]  No, I agree.
[03:24:56.000 --> 03:25:01.000]  So it may trigger riots of Kavanaugh's confirmed, but definitely the day after the election,
[03:25:01.000 --> 03:25:05.000]  November 9th, man, you're, I mean, I think it's going to be dangerous.
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:07.000]  I call it Gettysburg.
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:09.000]  I call these midterms Gettysburg.
[03:25:09.000 --> 03:25:15.000]  If you go back to your Civil War one history, the British were on the sidelines.
[03:25:15.000 --> 03:25:17.000]  The British really wanted the cotton.
[03:25:17.000 --> 03:25:20.000]  And if it looked like the Confederacy was going to be a success,
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:23.000]  Britain wanted to make a deal straight with the South.
[03:25:23.000 --> 03:25:24.000]  No tariffs.
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:27.000]  That was one of the issues before the Civil War was the tariffs.
[03:25:27.000 --> 03:25:30.000]  The agricultural South wanted just free trade with Britain.
[03:25:30.000 --> 03:25:34.000]  Well, everybody was waiting for Gettysburg.
[03:25:34.000 --> 03:25:37.000]  When those armies were heading into Pennsylvania,
[03:25:37.000 --> 03:25:41.000]  everybody knew it was going to be a pivot of history.
[03:25:41.000 --> 03:25:47.000]  And when the Union forces, family defeated the Confederacy at Gettysburg,
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:50.000]  after that, the war was all she wrote.
[03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:53.000]  Britain said that's, you know, we're not going to support the South.
[03:25:53.000 --> 03:25:56.000]  Do you say Gettysburg or Waterloo?
[03:25:56.000 --> 03:25:57.000]  Winning the midterms?
[03:25:57.000 --> 03:26:00.000]  Are you saying it might be the Waterloo in the left?
[03:26:00.000 --> 03:26:05.000]  If we, if we win, it's Gettysburg in terms of what I mean is in terms of a real pivot.
[03:26:05.000 --> 03:26:09.000]  Everybody right now is just watching, holding their breath.
[03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:14.000]  If the left wins, then they get control of all of these committees,
[03:26:14.000 --> 03:26:16.000]  which is where the real muscle in.
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:20.000]  And then they go into supercharge, which hunts on every level.
[03:26:20.000 --> 03:26:24.000]  And not only that, there'll be a massive crackdown on the internet.
[03:26:24.000 --> 03:26:26.000]  And we've already seen a hint of this.
[03:26:26.000 --> 03:26:31.000]  You've seen the Democrats calling for me to be banned and it happened, so they're going to go into overdrive.
[03:26:31.000 --> 03:26:36.000]  Well, look at, look at James, I understand you or me, but look at James Woods.
[03:26:36.000 --> 03:26:40.000]  He's a good guy, you know, I mean, he's a conservative, but nobody says we hate James Woods.
[03:26:40.000 --> 03:26:46.000]  They gave away, one of the, they gave away their play game, their play card.
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:49.000]  When they said it, it was based on election interference.
[03:26:49.000 --> 03:26:51.000]  You know, they've done that shit.
[03:26:51.000 --> 03:26:54.000]  They don't want you to say something that makes the Democrats lose.
[03:26:54.000 --> 03:26:55.000]  Exactly.
[03:26:55.000 --> 03:26:57.000]  They just said about me, we want Jones off.
[03:26:57.000 --> 03:26:59.000]  He's a Russian interfering.
[03:26:59.000 --> 03:27:01.000]  I'm a Russian like I'm a monkey's uncle.
[03:27:01.000 --> 03:27:06.000]  But we, what we've seen this in the past 20, 30 years, it started with asset forfeiture,
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:08.000]  which everybody thought was great.
[03:27:08.000 --> 03:27:10.000]  We'll get rid of the narco cartels.
[03:27:10.000 --> 03:27:13.000]  And it turned out to be that confiscate $2,000.
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:14.000]  Sure.
[03:27:14.000 --> 03:27:18.000]  And what do you think Trump's going to say coming up in a few weeks in this secret meeting with the tech heads?
[03:27:18.000 --> 03:27:20.000]  Hey, the left's going to take you over.
[03:27:20.000 --> 03:27:22.000]  I'm not the one going to take you over.
[03:27:22.000 --> 03:27:24.000]  Why the hell are you allied with these people?
[03:27:24.000 --> 03:27:26.000]  The left has already taken them over.
[03:27:26.000 --> 03:27:30.000]  Google is a subsidiary of China, the whole dragonfly project.
[03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:32.000]  We're just next down the line.
[03:27:32.000 --> 03:27:34.000]  You look at these Google coders.
[03:27:34.000 --> 03:27:35.000]  No, no, I agree.
[03:27:35.000 --> 03:27:36.000]  We broke all that.
[03:27:36.000 --> 03:27:38.000]  So what do you think Trump should say to him?
[03:27:38.000 --> 03:27:42.000]  I think that they should say you're more of a danger than standard oil ever was.
[03:27:42.000 --> 03:27:43.000]  And we're going to break you up.
[03:27:43.000 --> 03:27:44.000]  No, no, I agree.
[03:27:44.000 --> 03:27:47.000]  I mean, obviously Trump's going to give them the carrot first.
[03:27:47.000 --> 03:27:49.000]  That's what he does.
[03:27:49.000 --> 03:27:55.000]  Well, he'll probably give them the warning, but I think that this entire election, the midterms, is going to be about Kavanaugh.
[03:27:55.000 --> 03:27:57.000]  And the base is so energized.
[03:27:57.000 --> 03:27:58.000]  Kavanaugh is red-pilled now.
[03:27:58.000 --> 03:28:01.000]  So now the left really knows it's important.
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:05.000]  And if Kavanaugh is on the bench, they're going to lose all the time.
[03:28:05.000 --> 03:28:07.000]  So they're going to go kinetic.
[03:28:07.000 --> 03:28:09.000]  And at that point, I think that...
[03:28:09.000 --> 03:28:11.000]  I'm going to let you take over.
[03:28:11.000 --> 03:28:18.000]  So you think they know, because I agree with you, this is one with their face, you think they know they messed up?
[03:28:18.000 --> 03:28:22.000]  No, because just like with Hillary, they double down on stupid.
[03:28:22.000 --> 03:28:27.000]  You know, they thought that the deplorable strategy would carry them to victory in 2016.
[03:28:27.000 --> 03:28:34.000]  But it energized, you know, the white West Virginia, you know, Michigan working man base against the left.
[03:28:34.000 --> 03:28:38.000]  And now with Kavanaugh, they're crucifying this Christian man.
[03:28:38.000 --> 03:28:41.000]  And Christians are seeing this crucifixion.
[03:28:41.000 --> 03:28:46.000]  And they are going to crawl over broken glass to vote in November.
[03:28:46.000 --> 03:28:50.000]  I agree. Matt Bracken takes over straight ahead at enemiesfarndedomestic.com.
[03:28:50.000 --> 03:29:16.000]  We're with infowars.com.

[03:32:18.000 --> 03:32:26.000]  For heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH, what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:32:26.000 --> 03:32:34.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity filter, and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure,
[03:32:34.000 --> 03:32:38.000]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:32:38.000 --> 03:32:43.000]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water,
[03:32:43.000 --> 03:32:49.000]  so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:32:49.000 --> 03:33:14.000]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:33:19.000 --> 03:33:24.000]  Broadcasting live from the U.N. Stronghold, Austin, Texas.
[03:33:24.000 --> 03:33:29.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:34.000]  Show more leaks. New York Times gets Trump trove of confidential tax returns.
[03:33:34.000 --> 03:33:37.000]  This just shows the criminal activity that goes on.
[03:33:37.000 --> 03:33:43.000]  I read the article during the break. I was going to have Matt take over, but it's saying Trump's not self-made.
[03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:46.000]  In fact, he didn't run after never running for office and won the presidency.
[03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:52.000]  He didn't give us a 4.8% growth rate. He didn't renegotiate and pull us out of TPP and NAFTA.
[03:33:52.000 --> 03:33:57.000]  He didn't do all these positive things. No, no, no. His father, Fred Trump, did.
[03:33:57.000 --> 03:34:03.000]  And it talks about family trusts that his dad set up in real estate.
[03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:08.000]  They've got numbers like 10 million, 12 million over the years, 20 million to the family.
[03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:10.000]  No one ever denied that.
[03:34:10.000 --> 03:34:13.000]  But Donald Trump went on and made much bigger fortunes.
[03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:16.000]  That is even what matters. He's not Carlos Slim.
[03:34:16.000 --> 03:34:22.000]  They got $5 billion from U.S. taxpayers over eight years with Obama for the Obama phone contract.
[03:34:22.000 --> 03:34:26.000]  Who's worth what? Last time I heard like 100 to something billion.
[03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:33.000]  Yeah, there it is. He owns the New York Times and gets taxpayer money as part of the kickbacks.
[03:34:33.000 --> 03:34:37.000]  They've come out in the New York Times and some of these payments.
[03:34:37.000 --> 03:34:43.000]  So this is amazing, ladies and gentlemen, you read this, it says,
[03:34:43.000 --> 03:34:48.000]  Trump received over the years the equivalent today of at least that's inflation,
[03:34:48.000 --> 03:34:51.000]  like 10 million, 413 million from his father's real estate empire,
[03:34:51.000 --> 03:34:55.000]  starting when he was a toddler and continuing to this day.
[03:34:55.000 --> 03:34:59.000]  So yeah, if you're rich and you put money into family trusts, you're bad.
[03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:03.000]  And it's all about Trump's an idiot. He can't even wipe his own ass.
[03:35:03.000 --> 03:35:07.000]  Excuse me. I mean, oh, look at him with his mommy. Oh, it's so horrible.
[03:35:07.000 --> 03:35:09.000]  Oh God, he's such a bad person.
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:13.000]  And why he's bad is he didn't sell out America. He's not a globalist.
[03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:18.000]  So it's a pathetic, pathetic article. Matt Bracken, go ahead and get your key news.
[03:35:18.000 --> 03:35:20.000]  I'm done covering that.
[03:35:20.000 --> 03:35:24.000]  Yeah, you know, I'm following it too, but I think it's just like Kavanaugh.
[03:35:24.000 --> 03:35:29.000]  It's going to boomerang. It's going to blow up like a cheap, you know, exploding cigar.
[03:35:29.000 --> 03:35:33.000]  Because it's so patently obvious that this was just timed,
[03:35:33.000 --> 03:35:37.000]  that they've probably been sitting on this for months, just like the Billy Bush tape.
[03:35:37.000 --> 03:35:41.000]  And, you know, they're just waiting to throw that card on the table at the opportune moment.
[03:35:41.000 --> 03:35:45.000]  But I think it explodes in their face. People have seen this.
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:51.000]  You know, I now consider Kavanaugh to be the ultimate red pill, not just for him,
[03:35:51.000 --> 03:35:56.000]  but for millions of Americans, it still had some kind of faith in our system.
[03:35:56.000 --> 03:36:02.000]  And watching this Salem witch trial of a hearing over the last two weeks,
[03:36:02.000 --> 03:36:06.000]  I think that it's opened up the eyes of millions of Democrats.
[03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:11.000]  I agree with you, but what feedback have you gotten on the ground that makes you say that?
[03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:15.000]  It's all anecdotal. You know, people are saying that, you know,
[03:36:15.000 --> 03:36:19.000]  the numbers shifting in the swing state Senate votes, for example.
[03:36:19.000 --> 03:36:23.000]  And just anecdotally, and who knows how to interpret it, people saying,
[03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:26.000]  I've been a Democrat all my life and I don't like Trump,
[03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:29.000]  but I'm going to vote just because of what they've done to Kavanaugh.
[03:36:29.000 --> 03:36:34.000]  This has been a public crucifixion and it really shows what they would do if they had full power.
[03:36:34.000 --> 03:36:36.000]  This is what they do from a position...
[03:36:36.000 --> 03:36:40.000]  That's what Lindsey Graham said. He said, God, I hope you don't get the power you want.
[03:36:40.000 --> 03:36:42.000]  That's right. Thank God for Lindsey Graham. He came through.
[03:36:42.000 --> 03:36:46.000]  I'll tell you what, I've disagreed with him tremendously over the years.
[03:36:46.000 --> 03:36:49.000]  And as McCain's sidekick, I thought he, you know, he was...
[03:36:49.000 --> 03:36:53.000]  I was about to say, he was a slave of McCain. I think we're going to see a different side now.
[03:36:53.000 --> 03:36:59.000]  That's right. And in the end, I think that, especially in the judicial context,
[03:36:59.000 --> 03:37:05.000]  you know, that's where he lives. That's where he's been an attorney all his life as a judge, as a jag, all this.
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:10.000]  This is really offending him, this end of due process where it's going to be, you know,
[03:37:10.000 --> 03:37:14.000]  trial by, trial by, what do they call it? Like the witches, you know,
[03:37:14.000 --> 03:37:17.000]  you have to prove you're not a witch. We're going to duck you in the water.
[03:37:17.000 --> 03:37:22.000]  And, you know, and finally, I think a lot of the Republicans that have been fence setters,
[03:37:22.000 --> 03:37:27.000]  they didn't know, like Lindsey Graham, for example, they didn't know if they would stand tall with the tough
[03:37:27.000 --> 03:37:33.000]  Freedom Caucus guys or go squishy like Flake. I think universally, Flake's been considered, you know,
[03:37:33.000 --> 03:37:39.000]  just a total wuss out of this. And we're going to see a lot of stiffening of spines,
[03:37:39.000 --> 03:37:45.000]  because if they roll over, no matter what you think of Kavanaugh, even if you thought he ever, you know,
[03:37:45.000 --> 03:37:49.000]  he's going to open Pandora's box for false allegations.
[03:37:49.000 --> 03:37:54.000]  And right. And then if the basis is demoralized and doesn't come out to vote because they give up,
[03:37:54.000 --> 03:37:59.000]  then the Senate wins. Then we're going to see star chamber trials like nobody's ever seen,
[03:37:59.000 --> 03:38:04.000]  including impeachment of Kavanaugh, impeachment of Trump, I mean, down the line.
[03:38:04.000 --> 03:38:10.000]  So, you know, right now is an unbelievable time in our history. I would say we're ripe for something
[03:38:10.000 --> 03:38:16.000]  like a false flag, right, stag, fire, but these things can burn out of control.
[03:38:16.000 --> 03:38:21.000]  I mean, there's no holding it back. But, you know, I think that this New York Times story, though,
[03:38:21.000 --> 03:38:27.000]  it's really a sign of weakness and fear and desperation. I have no doubt they've been holding this like a whole card.
[03:38:27.000 --> 03:38:32.000]  Why did they throw it out now? You know, they should be going all out, you know,
[03:38:32.000 --> 03:38:39.000]  pedal to the metal on Kavanaugh. Where's the new allegations? You know, where's the new accusations?
[03:38:39.000 --> 03:38:43.000]  I think they realized they're going to lose and now they want to change the channel.
[03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  Like we're all sheep and we're just going to go squirrel over there. New York Times.
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:38:51.000]  People aren't buying it. We've got their playbook.
[03:38:51.000 --> 03:38:55.000]  Oh my God, his dad was rich and had a family trust for all the descendants.
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:38:57.000]  Oh my God, he's so evil.
[03:38:57.000 --> 03:39:02.000]  This is like when Patton in the movie, he says in North Africa about Dom Rommel,
[03:39:02.000 --> 03:39:11.000]  I read your book, you know, Americans have read their book. Now millions of Americans have been red-pilled by this Kavanaugh fiasco.
[03:39:11.000 --> 03:39:17.000]  And I think that no matter what they do now, they came out with another witness against Kavanaugh
[03:39:17.000 --> 03:39:24.000]  or another Billy Bush tape against Trump, people are just going to roll their eyes and steal their heart even more.
[03:39:24.000 --> 03:39:33.000]  Because people are realizing that the entire Democrat media complex has just been creating a lie the whole time.
[03:39:33.000 --> 03:39:38.000]  What about delusional Antiovetti or how do you say that idiot's name?
[03:39:38.000 --> 03:39:43.000]  I think him and his client are just media whores, period.
[03:39:43.000 --> 03:39:48.000]  Well, no, exactly. He says the top Democrats want me to run for president. Boy, I hope so.
[03:39:48.000 --> 03:39:59.000]  He's totally delusional, but the left is delusional in general. And this is what happens when you get this spiral towards harder and harder Marxism.
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:08.000]  As people at the edges get red-pilled and come over to our side, what's left becomes more radical and starts spinning faster.
[03:40:08.000 --> 03:40:15.000]  And this is where I'm not saying the man Bob Kramer, I'm just using him as an example of the cutout, the intermediary.
[03:40:15.000 --> 03:40:22.000]  Nobody at the upper echelon of the Democratic National Committee is going to say, I think it's time to start shooting people.
[03:40:22.000 --> 03:40:29.000]  But what they'll say is, we can no longer, it looks like we just can't work through the system with these Republicans.
[03:40:29.000 --> 03:40:33.000]  And it gets translated down the line until people are handing guns to Antifa.
[03:40:33.000 --> 03:40:41.000]  And that's what I think is coming. I think that there are James Hodgkessons out there right now practicing with their SKS.
[03:40:41.000 --> 03:40:47.000]  They're admittedly doing it. These people are crazy.
[03:40:47.000 --> 03:40:55.000]  The Supreme Court has become, we play by the Marquis to Queensbury rules, the Marquis to Queensbury rules.
[03:40:55.000 --> 03:41:01.000]  No matter what happens, it's the Alinsky playbook. Make us play by our rules.
[03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:08.000]  So we get back up and get back into a, okay. And meanwhile, the other guys got the referee stabbing us in the back.
[03:41:08.000 --> 03:41:18.000]  They're throwing rocks from the audience. And finally, the squishy Republicans are getting red-pilled and realizing they're in a street fight.
[03:41:18.000 --> 03:41:19.000]  So we're going to have a vote.
[03:41:19.000 --> 03:41:25.000]  I agree. It's a Republican leadership now knowing if they give into this, it's the stampede they're done.
[03:41:25.000 --> 03:41:27.000]  Democrats don't want to share power anymore in the corrupt system.
[03:41:27.000 --> 03:41:32.000]  They want to eradicate the Republicans and split the Democrats into two parties, Communists and Socialists.
[03:41:32.000 --> 03:41:36.000]  And now the blue bloods finally get in and they're finally digging in.
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:42.000]  And on our side, even the never-trumpers are realizing that this is an existential moment.
[03:41:42.000 --> 03:41:47.000]  That's why I say between Kavanaugh to the midterms, this is Gettysburg.
[03:41:47.000 --> 03:41:53.000]  I think it's a better analogy than Waterloo, which was international.
[03:41:53.000 --> 03:41:56.000]  Sure, no, Gettysburg is better because it's America. I get it.
[03:41:56.000 --> 03:41:59.000]  Right. And it was the high watermark. It's like we're going for broke.
[03:41:59.000 --> 03:42:03.000]  I'm not comparing either the left or the right to the south or the north.
[03:42:03.000 --> 03:42:07.000]  I'm just saying in terms of a civil war, this is one of those moments, you know,
[03:42:07.000 --> 03:42:11.000]  there's going to be a before and an after this Gettysburg midterm.
[03:42:11.000 --> 03:42:16.000]  Kavanaugh gets confirmed. Republicans control Congress.
[03:42:16.000 --> 03:42:18.000]  The left will go go crazy violent.
[03:42:18.000 --> 03:42:25.000]  If they take Congress, it's going to be impeachment and no more Internet, which is rather when and make them get violent
[03:42:25.000 --> 03:42:30.000]  and then finally have a tipping point and fully defeat them forever.
[03:42:30.000 --> 03:42:36.000]  You know, the left writes most of the history books, but there have been some occasions in history
[03:42:36.000 --> 03:42:41.000]  when the communists jumped the gun or overreached and they got wiped out.
[03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:47.000]  And there are perfect analogies. You know, you can look at the CIA did some, you know,
[03:42:47.000 --> 03:42:50.000]  did work in Chile and Guatemala, places like that.
[03:42:50.000 --> 03:42:51.000]  But also...
[03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:53.000]  So the left just took over the CIA.

[03:44:45.000 --> 03:44:53.000]  Something the globalists are targeting, visit InfoWars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[03:44:53.000 --> 03:45:00.000]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing
[03:45:00.000 --> 03:45:04.000]  to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:45:04.000 --> 03:45:09.000]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:45:09.000 --> 03:45:16.000]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[03:45:16.000 --> 03:45:19.000]  and it supports the InfoWars. It is a classical 360-win.
[03:45:19.000 --> 03:45:23.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year,
[03:45:23.000 --> 03:45:29.000]  and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:45:29.000 --> 03:45:34.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[03:45:34.000 --> 03:45:39.000]  that Patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:44.000]  because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level
[03:45:44.000 --> 03:45:46.000]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:45:46.000 --> 03:45:49.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:46:15.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:46:19.000 --> 03:46:27.000]  Millennium is an electrochemical. It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons.
[03:46:27.000 --> 03:46:30.000]  So these go incredibly well together. We have a combo of those.
[03:46:30.000 --> 03:46:34.000]  Just experience it for yourself. Why do you think they fear me so much?
[03:46:34.000 --> 03:46:37.000]  Very simple stuff. Filter your water.
[03:46:37.000 --> 03:46:39.000]  Yeah, I've found myself some water filters.
[03:46:39.000 --> 03:46:41.000]  Best out there for the price.
[03:46:41.000 --> 03:46:45.000]  When I say it's the last run, I think it'll be six bucks a year until we get more.
[03:46:45.000 --> 03:46:57.000]  I hope we get more. This is the last run. It looks like Survival Short X2, InfoWarsTour.com, or InfoWarsLive.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[03:46:57.000 --> 03:47:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:05.000 --> 03:47:27.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:47:27.000 --> 03:47:38.000]  Hey, Matt Bracken with the final segment of the Alex Jones Show today. I'd like to talk about what the ramifications of the last couple hours.
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:53.000]  We've been talking about the Kavanaugh hearings, the midterms, what it's going to mean in terms of our American freedom, depending on if Kavanaugh is confirmed or rejected, and if we hold the Congress or not in the midterms.
[03:47:53.000 --> 03:47:59.000]  Either way, it's obvious that the left is gunning for us on social media and the internet.
[03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:07.000]  This is how we see it with Google slanting their search results, even though they deny it. It's obvious.
[03:48:07.000 --> 03:48:15.000]  We see it with Google cooperating with the Chinese communists on programs to locate and punish dissidents.
[03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:26.000]  Don't think they wouldn't do it here. I don't consider Google to be an American company in any respect. To me, it's purely a globalist country located in California.
[03:48:26.000 --> 03:48:32.000]  It's buildings in California, but it's a globalist country, a company, period.
[03:48:32.000 --> 03:48:47.000]  And as we've seen, not only are patriots being kicked off of YouTube, demonetized now for more than a year, not even allowed to use Patreon. They're picking us off one at a time.
[03:48:47.000 --> 03:48:55.000]  And we've seen partial solutions or partial answers, and people are working hard to try to provide alternatives.
[03:48:55.000 --> 03:49:07.000]  Some of them have been bit-shoot, which has a lot of problems. GAB is up, which is kind of like a more or less a slower Twitter clone, but doing some pretty good work.
[03:49:07.000 --> 03:49:15.000]  And there's mines.com, which I never really got into, a Facebook alternative.
[03:49:15.000 --> 03:49:35.000]  But over the past couple of weeks, I've been let in on a project that's been ongoing for a year. I consider this to be probably the culmination of my contribution as a patriot over the last decades, since I've been an author for the last 15 years.
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:48.000]  Anyway, I guess it's given me a certain amount of credibility and enough of a profile that some people would approach me with insight or knowledge like this.
[03:49:48.000 --> 03:49:54.000]  But stay tuned over the next couple of days for some pretty major announcements.
[03:49:54.000 --> 03:50:07.000]  I would put this at the level of the way that the media was so left-wing controlled before Rush Limbaugh came along in the late 80s or Fox News, I guess, around 1990.
[03:50:07.000 --> 03:50:20.000]  That's how much of a watershed moment this is going to be. I'm being a little bit cagey right now about the announcement, because while an infant like this is in its cradle, it might be the time to choke it off.
[03:50:20.000 --> 03:50:40.000]  So we're going to make some announcements and make a move to a platform that will be combining the best attributes and strengths and powers of YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Patreon, podcasts, some elements of Skype for internal communication,
[03:50:40.000 --> 03:51:01.000]  your blogcasts, all within our own friendly hands, not just a segment of it or a corner of this internet social media world, but the entire universe under one roof, under friendly, libertarian, conservative control.
[03:51:01.000 --> 03:51:20.000]  Now, one of the problems with alternative social media has been their small size. When you only occupy a little segment of the internet, it's easy for the giants surrounding you to isolate you like you are a virus and just blockade you from every angle.
[03:51:20.000 --> 03:51:40.000]  You know, not allow your apps to be sold in their stores, for example, so that you're choked off. And in the case of Gab, I would have to say that their pure First Amendment No Limits policy has been kind of a poison pill that they built in, unfortunately,
[03:51:40.000 --> 03:52:01.000]  because while you can block the Nazis and the crazies on Gab, they're flourishing. There's no question about it. This new site will have a no totalitarian promotion policy, meaning we're not going to send you the bullets to shoot back at us if you ever achieve power.
[03:52:01.000 --> 03:52:14.000]  We're not going to help you come to power if your policy would then be to take away our free speech and murder us. So on this new platform, it's oriented to conservative libertarians.
[03:52:14.000 --> 03:52:33.000]  Now, if you do want to do sports videos, anything else, that's fine, but we're not going to allow the promotion of communism, Nazism, Islamism, or globalism, because these are godless, satanic ideologies that if they rose to power would murder us all.
[03:52:33.000 --> 03:52:44.000]  So we're not going to sell them the rope to hang us, but within those limits, and people like myself will be in control of who's on this platform for a change.
[03:52:44.000 --> 03:52:53.000]  Within those limits, it's going to be anything goes. So a lot of the YouTube videos that have been shut down, they'll still be on this platform.
[03:52:53.000 --> 03:53:13.000]  For example, One American News Network, which is a small but really great alternative to Fox. This is right on DirecTV. They put up a video, it's like a 15 minute special about the fall of Birmingham, England from the 70s until today and how it's been totally invaded and Islamized.
[03:53:13.000 --> 03:53:32.000]  Well, guess what? YouTube doesn't like it. They took it down. I mean, it's banned on Facebook, it's banned on YouTube. This is a One American News Network mini documentary on Birmingham, England, just the historical reality, the factual reality on the ground, banned on YouTube.
[03:53:32.000 --> 03:53:49.000]  They don't want us to see what's going on with this Muslim invasion in Europe and demographic invasion of the West in general. So we need to have a place where we can speak openly about some concepts that are taboo.
[03:53:49.000 --> 03:54:08.000]  We're not talking about Nazi stuff, anything like that. But as it is now, just saying it's okay to be white puts you into a category where you're delisted on YouTube. I mean, just saying, gee, this sure looks like they're gearing up for genocide of the whites across the world.
[03:54:08.000 --> 03:54:24.000]  It automatically gets you banned. You can't even discuss it. Well, if you can't discuss an idea, how can we rally? How can we organize? How can we defend ourselves? This is what they do when they're gearing up for a genocide.
[03:54:24.000 --> 03:54:40.000]  They demonize us. If white men my age were automatically guilty, they'd like to castrate us and feed us to pigs, according to the Georgetown professor. They would stop at nothing. We're not even allowed now to defend ourselves.
[03:54:40.000 --> 03:54:56.000]  The cultures that built the great cathedrals 500, 600 years ago, created symphony orchestras, created the Dutch master painting, led the world in every area that brought the Enlightenment, the Renaissance, the Reformation.
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:11.000]  Now we're all just targeted as evil white people that have to shut up. And I'm sorry, we need a platform where we can promote our own self-defense, basically. And that's going to be coming out over the next few days.
[03:55:11.000 --> 03:55:25.000]  And I hope people will give it a chance. Now, the one claim of existing social media like Facebook, where I've been banned, by the way, six times for 30 days out of the last year.
[03:55:25.000 --> 03:55:37.000]  The last time I posted, I created a meme based on just two existing news stories from the last week. One shows a bunch of sub-saharons in a giant rubber boat heading for Spain.
[03:55:37.000 --> 03:55:46.000]  The other is Monkey Pox victims and an article in a scientific magazine saying that the Monkey Pox is now in the United Kingdom.
[03:55:46.000 --> 03:56:00.000]  I put these two stories together with just a comment, gee, what could go wrong with uncontrolled mass immigration, the boats, the Monkey Pox, the headline from the news story, and I'm banned for another 30 days from Facebook.
[03:56:00.000 --> 03:56:12.000]  We're not even allowed to talk about the dangers to our Western civilization. Well, this is the precursor to the railroading us right to the gulags.
[03:56:12.000 --> 03:56:22.000]  And they're picking us off of social media, blocking us out, and then when they ban you, nobody even knows, you just disappear, your voice goes silent.
[03:56:22.000 --> 03:56:32.000]  Well, we need a place where we're not going to be silent, and it's coming, and just stay tuned and watch this space, there'll be announcements in the next couple of days.
[03:56:32.000 --> 03:56:49.000]  Now, the only thing that you can say that's nice, I guess, about Facebook, Twitter, etc., etc., is they're free, but you have to keep in mind their monetary model is to data mine your brain, to strip mine your cerebrum, your privacy,
[03:56:49.000 --> 03:57:04.000]  the websites you visit, the products you buy, to crunch it with supercomputers, put it through social network analysis meat grinders, and then turn that out to target corporations to advertise to you.
[03:57:04.000 --> 03:57:13.000]  Well, if you love that free model, if you don't mind giving up your privacy and being restricted and censored and forced to self-censor, that's fine.
[03:57:13.000 --> 03:57:23.000]  But something new is coming, and it's going to be coming soon, and I hope people will join me on this new platform when the announcement is made, because it's going to be pretty exciting.
[03:57:23.000 --> 03:57:33.000]  I don't think I'm exaggerating. It's going to be like when Rush Limbaugh came out for Fox News. So please be with me when this announcement's made.
[03:57:33.000 --> 03:57:43.000]  And that's the end of my little segment today, and I'll see you next time.
