[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:27.000 --> 00:37.000]  The war, for our very destiny, isn't coming.
[00:37.000 --> 00:44.000]  The war is undoubtedly now a hot war, and it's here.
[00:44.000 --> 00:53.000]  And organizations and groups are clearly choosing the demarcation line of which side they're on.
[00:53.000 --> 01:02.000]  Where to begin on this live Sunday, November 24th, 2019, global transmission.
[01:02.000 --> 01:06.000]  Where to start?
[01:06.000 --> 01:14.000]  Franklin Graham says that the supranational element of demonic power is behind attacks on Trump.
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  Undoubtedly, that is true.
[01:17.000 --> 01:29.000]  Now, the Justice Department has confirmed that FBI, at high levels, falsified documents against the president and others.
[01:29.000 --> 01:42.000]  Meanwhile, Bloomberg officially enters the 2020 race to, quote, defeat Trump and rebuild America when it's been the globalists that have deindustrialized the nation.
[01:42.000 --> 01:50.000]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg has been fighting for her life in and out of the hospital last week, put back in this weekend, now supposedly out.
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  She has pancreatic cancer, I predict she'll be debbed in one month.
[01:55.000 --> 02:04.000]  And a giant fight will accelerate the hysteria we already see with impeachment and more.
[02:04.000 --> 02:13.000]  Giuliani says Biden documents will be released if he disappears, says they want to kill him.
[02:13.000 --> 02:21.000]  I listened to Giuliani, he helped cover up what really happened on 9-11.
[02:21.000 --> 02:35.000]  And there's so much more we're going to be getting to today, like in Virginia and elsewhere, gun supporters prepared to defy new laws to turn their guns in.
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  Now, the illegal aliens in 800 plus towns and cities don't follow law.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  They're allowed to drink and drive to where they want.
[02:41.000 --> 02:54.000]  They don't have IDs, but we're just saying you're not taking our Second Amendment just because your local laws can counterman the great law of the land bought and died for by this Republic.
[02:54.000 --> 02:58.000]  That's all coming up.
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  But what's the really big news?
[03:02.000 --> 03:10.000]  What's the earth shaking news?
[03:10.000 --> 03:39.000]  The Anti-Defamation League, a supposed civil rights organization that runs the censorship at Big Tech, that's on record, has come out through the spokesperson and announced the next phase of the totalitarianism.
[03:39.000 --> 03:47.000]  A lot of people saw him say this on Thursday, we covered it on Friday, and they said that guy's a washed-up comedian, his latest movies have all failed.
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  Why do we care what Sacha Bericone has to say?
[03:50.000 --> 04:07.000]  Well, because he was reading off a teleprompter what the ADLs already said they're planning, and he calls for the arrest of the big six tech heads starting with Mark Zuckerberg and the complete handover to the ADL of all communications.
[04:07.000 --> 04:16.000]  Now that's dictator stuff, that's Hitler stuff, right out of the crazy ADL.
[04:16.000 --> 04:23.000]  But it's part of the course.
[04:23.000 --> 04:30.000]  And the definition of putzpa, and extremely dangerous.
[04:30.000 --> 04:38.000]  Donald Trump's called a Nazi, so am I. And so we're not human.
[04:38.000 --> 04:47.000]  Of course the truth is, the only real Nazis around here is the ADL, they work for that Nazi collaborator, George Soros.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  See, if you're a real Nazi, that's where you hide.
[04:50.000 --> 05:01.000]  They gave awards to Schwarzenegger, who says he admires Hitler. The ADL is a Nazi organization.
[05:01.000 --> 05:10.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true, but I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[05:10.000 --> 05:16.000]  I could see where the globalists were going, I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[05:16.000 --> 05:24.000]  And I knew that when they were setting a sub-PD platform, that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air,
[05:24.000 --> 05:34.000]  to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers, so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[05:34.000 --> 05:40.000]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[05:40.000 --> 05:46.000]  It was the model of info wars as much as the information that had to be silenced,
[05:46.000 --> 05:52.000]  because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[05:52.000 --> 06:20.000]  And that's why keeping info wars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[06:20.000 --> 06:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is November 24th, 2019.
[06:26.000 --> 06:32.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones. We're going to be here for two hours as we are every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.000]  All right, let's dig right in to our top stories here today.
[06:38.000 --> 06:48.000]  Attorney General Barb has come out and says Epstein's death was a perfect storm of screw ups, and of course no one's buying that.
[06:48.000 --> 07:00.000]  J.P. runs the headline, feds fight back as Epstein's death conspiracy theories swirl.
[07:00.000 --> 07:06.000]  Bar ends all conspiracy theories. Jeffrey Epstein killed himself in a perfect storm of screw ups,
[07:06.000 --> 07:13.000]  and Jesse Smollett really got attacked by white supremacists that poured bleach on his face and really had a new surround his neck.
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  And by the way, he said follow lawsuit against the police for false prosecution.
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  I mean, it's totally staged, totally rigged.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  The people that helped him do it have the receipts and now he paid him to do it.
[07:25.000 --> 07:32.000]  We have them going to the stores and buying the noose and buying the mask and buying the bleach and doing it all.
[07:32.000 --> 07:36.000]  It doesn't matter. No, it's real. There's white supremacists everywhere.
[07:36.000 --> 07:47.000]  And if we don't let the left take control of our lives and let the Antifa go around and beat us up and tell us what to do, well, then it's all over, isn't it?
[07:47.000 --> 07:50.000]  Absolutely all over.
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  So we're going to be getting into all this today.
[07:53.000 --> 08:00.000]  The Antifa beating up old people, smashing out the cars with their windows, the Oregonian newspaper calling them heroes.
[08:00.000 --> 08:02.000]  Damn right.
[08:02.000 --> 08:05.000]  It's all coming up today.
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  But let me tell you what our top story is going to be.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  And it's extremely serious. It's extremely important.
[08:15.000 --> 08:22.000]  And I'm going to start covering it at the start of the next segment and play the clips.
[08:22.000 --> 08:47.000]  The ADL, a supposed Jewish civil rights organization founded in 1913 after a man kidnapped, tortured and killed a 13-year-old girl and were founded to say that he deserved to go free, I guess.
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  I'm not kidding. Look it up.
[08:50.000 --> 09:05.000]  That organization who's lost all these lawsuits for calling people Nazis that aren't, goes around and pays off and buys off the police departments around the country, and it's just a leftist communist organization.
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  That's really what it is.
[09:07.000 --> 09:16.000]  And if you don't accept communism and socialism and sexualization of children and everything else, the ADL comes out and attacks you.
[09:16.000 --> 09:21.000]  And as so much pull, they can get your bank accounts taken away. They can get your merchant accounts taken away.
[09:21.000 --> 09:26.000]  And that's what the Nazis did to the Jews in the early 1930s. Really bad stuff.
[09:26.000 --> 09:34.000]  In fact, if you go just by activity, the ADL is the most Nazi-like organization on the planet today.
[09:34.000 --> 09:39.000]  Whatever Hitler did, they do it politically.
[09:39.000 --> 09:43.000]  They lie about people. They gang up on people. They have secret files on people.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  They sue people for no reason.
[09:46.000 --> 09:52.000]  And they go and they deplatform you. They take your ability to have commerce away.
[09:52.000 --> 10:00.000]  But now, through their spokesperson at their big event, they had Sacha Barry Cohen read off a teleprompter what they're planning.
[10:00.000 --> 10:13.000]  And it's the arrest of the big six tech heads, the big six tech heads, starting with Mark Zuckerberg.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  And you can pull this up.
[10:15.000 --> 10:26.000]  Facebook, Google, Apple, Twitter have all, going back three years ago, hired the ADL along with the Southern Primary Law Center as a consortium to be fact checkers.
[10:26.000 --> 10:29.000]  And they go around censoring everybody.
[10:29.000 --> 10:39.000]  And so the ADL's answer is, he literally says, you've got billions. You better give it to us and have us be able to censor whoever we want or we'll have you arrested.
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.000]  Wait till I play all these clips. I mean, this is crazy.
[10:42.000 --> 10:56.000]  When we've already seen an absolute reign of terror against free speech.
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  So we're going to be walking through all of that here today.
[11:01.000 --> 11:17.000]  But it's so draconian, so evil that it's it's stunning because I've been the victim of this group.
[11:17.000 --> 11:25.000]  I remember they put a big report out about 12 years ago saying Alex Jones says shoot Mexicans at the border.
[11:25.000 --> 11:31.000]  And I had lawyers send them letters and they retracted it.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  But nowadays they don't retract because they don't care.
[11:34.000 --> 11:35.000]  It's not just the ADL.
[11:35.000 --> 11:42.000]  It's all these big leftist organizations have gone stark raving mad, megalomania, whatever you want to call it.
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  It's it's it's just crazy. That's coming up next segment.
[11:45.000 --> 11:46.000]  I'm going to play the clubs.
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  He he calls for a purge of free speech.
[11:50.000 --> 12:01.000]  He says Stephen Miller, Donald Trump, Alex Jones are all Nazis.
[12:01.000 --> 12:12.000]  And the only thing Nazi like is what they're doing because caused by a Nazi's one of the top ways you can vilify him.
[12:12.000 --> 12:19.000]  And when you falsely do that to somebody so you can shut them up, it's very Nazi like.
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  And I mean, I couldn't believe the 24 minute speech.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  I did a whole two hour analysis of it.
[12:26.000 --> 12:28.000]  Friday night state of her late to do it.
[12:28.000 --> 12:29.000]  It's a band on video.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  And I hope you get it and get it out to everybody.
[12:31.000 --> 12:38.000]  You know, Sasha Baron Cohen calls for global free speech purge and ADL takeover of all social media.
[12:38.000 --> 12:45.000]  A combine of ruthless international corporations have camouflaged themselves as liberal victims of an impending second holocaust.
[12:45.000 --> 12:54.000]  Now the ADL now nest firmly in a metastasizing complex of expansionist global domination that represents the greatest threat to free humanity.
[12:54.000 --> 12:59.000]  Wrote that yesterday.
[12:59.000 --> 13:01.000]  So.
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  Yeah, I mean, I'm already working seven days a week.
[13:05.000 --> 13:09.000]  I'm not writing a lot of articles, but I'm writing them now because you have to folks.
[13:09.000 --> 13:15.000]  And he looks so scary looking at me.
[13:15.000 --> 13:18.000]  He looks like, you know, the new Sith guy, the new Star Wars movies.
[13:18.000 --> 13:19.000]  He can even play that.
[13:19.000 --> 13:24.000]  I mean, he looks like a Darth Vader, Hitler, you know, type.
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  I mean, I guess you could say central casting of a villain.
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  Count Dracula type.
[13:30.000 --> 13:33.000]  You're like, well, let's ignore the book cover.
[13:33.000 --> 13:34.000]  Let's read what's in it.
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  You're ready to go.
[13:35.000 --> 13:36.000]  Oh my God.
[13:36.000 --> 13:44.000]  Folks, flaming authoritarianism.
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  But it's all done because he's saying he's the good guy.
[13:47.000 --> 13:56.000]  And then he defames and swanders all these good people.
[13:56.000 --> 13:57.000]  Yeah.
[13:57.000 --> 14:02.000]  And of course, the ADL also came out called Stephen Miller, a white supremacist.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  He listens to info wars.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  They got his emails.
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  Oh my goodness.
[14:09.000 --> 14:18.000]  So I got to tell you, you know, it's the guy that played a rot or have you said the guy's
[14:18.000 --> 14:19.000]  name?
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  The supposed comedian Sasha Barak Owen.
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  He's the guy that popularized throw the Jew down the well so my country can be free.
[14:30.000 --> 14:37.000]  All I know is the ADL is trying to throw America down the well so the country will not be free.
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  And threatening to arrest everybody that doesn't submit.
[14:41.000 --> 14:45.000]  And he looks all crazy when he says it and smiles like a vampire and the crowds whooping
[14:45.000 --> 14:46.000]  and hollering and clapping.
[14:46.000 --> 14:56.000]  That's a dangerous organization right there.
[14:56.000 --> 15:05.000]  Very dangerous because they already got big tech to bow and to take on thousands of trained
[15:05.000 --> 15:08.000]  individuals from the ADL or the ADL press release.
[15:08.000 --> 15:15.000]  Three years ago to run big tech and to be in your accounts, including your private messengers
[15:15.000 --> 15:19.000]  and to be part of news guard with Microsoft and all these groups.
[15:19.000 --> 15:21.000]  And so now we've got the ADL.
[15:21.000 --> 15:24.000]  A lot of them aren't even American citizens.
[15:24.000 --> 15:31.000]  They're dual citizens with Israel in our business spying on us.
[15:31.000 --> 15:34.000]  And then saying they'll arrest people that don't submit to them.
[15:34.000 --> 15:40.000]  I mean, if that isn't tyranny, I don't know what is and it's dangerous.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  But again, that's the leftist ADL.
[15:42.000 --> 15:45.000]  They're run by Soros who doesn't think Israel should exist.
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.000]  That's why they moved to get Netanyahu out of power.
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  And that's why they're after Stephen Miller.
[15:51.000 --> 15:55.000]  And then now they're going to put around the neck of the Jews worldwide censorship and tyranny.
[15:55.000 --> 15:56.000]  It's terrible.
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  Very evil.
[16:00.000 --> 16:03.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[16:03.000 --> 16:11.000]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[16:11.000 --> 16:12.000]  How far will they go?
[16:12.000 --> 16:13.000]  What's their limit?
[16:13.000 --> 16:20.000]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil.
[16:23.000 --> 16:26.000]  It is a bottomless pit.
[16:26.000 --> 16:31.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist.
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  Or that there's no free will.
[16:33.000 --> 16:35.000]  There's no devil or the God.
[16:35.000 --> 16:41.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress
[16:41.000 --> 16:45.000]  and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[16:45.000 --> 16:49.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  That's Oxford's band clapping.
[16:51.000 --> 16:55.000]  The University of the U.S. of Band 21 gun salutes for veterans.
[16:55.000 --> 16:59.000]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.000]  when 3 million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[17:10.000 --> 17:14.000]  More than 50 to 1 some estimates have it.
[17:14.000 --> 17:19.000]  The point is they were outnumbered and the general was told, General, we're completely surrounded.
[17:19.000 --> 17:23.000]  He said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.000]  Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached.
[17:27.000 --> 17:30.000]  And it really is epic. It really is biblical.
[17:30.000 --> 17:33.000]  And we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[17:33.000 --> 17:40.000]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete.
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.000]  It's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced
[17:44.000 --> 17:49.000]  when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile
[17:49.000 --> 17:52.000]  or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[17:52.000 --> 17:58.000]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform, that checkmate's the globalist.
[18:01.000 --> 18:08.000]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida
[18:08.000 --> 18:10.000]  where he's always said he planned to retire to.
[18:10.000 --> 18:13.000]  And the left got so excited.
[18:13.000 --> 18:21.000]  They said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida.
[18:21.000 --> 18:23.000]  Well, now we know why the president did that.
[18:23.000 --> 18:29.000]  He knew the leftist-controlled appeals courts were going to say that he had to give up his tax returns
[18:29.000 --> 18:33.000]  so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got.
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with.
[18:37.000 --> 18:43.000]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed
[18:43.000 --> 18:47.000]  to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign.
[18:52.000 --> 18:58.000]  In his words, we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[18:58.000 --> 19:04.000]  Infowarstore.com, we have a new product and we got several thousand of these in
[19:04.000 --> 19:07.000]  and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[19:07.000 --> 19:12.000]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste
[19:12.000 --> 19:18.000]  and it doesn't compete with super blue that's four to five of colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free,
[19:18.000 --> 19:20.000]  the adult or the children's.
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  These are both excellent toothpaste, concentrates that don't have fillers.
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  People love it.
[19:25.000 --> 19:30.000]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans
[19:30.000 --> 19:34.000]  but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[19:34.000 --> 19:39.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes ginsivitis.
[19:39.000 --> 19:40.000]  This is all proven.
[19:40.000 --> 19:45.000]  You can make claims with this, but I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good
[19:45.000 --> 19:50.000]  for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[19:53.000 --> 19:54.000]  So we're really proud of it.
[19:54.000 --> 19:55.000]  It funds the operation.
[19:55.000 --> 19:56.000]  Infowarstore.com.
[19:56.000 --> 19:58.000]  And that's why we're still on air.
[19:58.000 --> 20:00.000]  Thanks to you.
[20:28.000 --> 20:42.000]  Again, it's Sunday, November 24, 2019.
[20:42.000 --> 20:47.000]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[20:47.000 --> 20:54.000]  So the ADL is a leftist organization that's come out in the last few years and said that
[20:54.000 --> 21:02.000]  if you don't like drag queen story time where men dress as women come in and children are
[21:02.000 --> 21:06.000]  put on their laps in many cases without the parents knowing inside public schools and
[21:06.000 --> 21:13.000]  libraries that you are hateful, they also want to have people arrested for their speech.
[21:13.000 --> 21:19.000]  The ADL has announced that the OK symbol is a hate symbol.
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  And so people are caught using it or being expelled from colleges and being fired from
[21:24.000 --> 21:25.000]  their jobs.
[21:25.000 --> 21:30.000]  Now they've said the brofist, meaning hey, fist bump, emoji is evil.
[21:30.000 --> 21:35.000]  And it's because the ADL wants total power over language just like the general left does
[21:35.000 --> 21:38.000]  at the universities and on the streets of America.
[21:38.000 --> 21:43.000]  They are the most intolerant people in the world, the left.
[21:43.000 --> 21:51.000]  And so the supposed leftist Jewish organization has come out and said Trump is a white supremacist
[21:51.000 --> 21:57.000]  because he believes the border should even exist, has upped their game even more.
[21:57.000 --> 22:07.000]  Remember how Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton got in trouble for shaking down major manufacturers
[22:07.000 --> 22:14.000]  like Texaco and Nike and others demanding money or they'd say that they were racist?
[22:14.000 --> 22:18.000]  That's really what this is.
[22:18.000 --> 22:25.000]  But the ADL has gotten way more power than the Reverend that Jesse Jackson ever got shaking
[22:25.000 --> 22:26.000]  people down.
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  In the last three years, they got control, and I'll show you the articles right here,
[22:30.000 --> 22:36.000]  your TV viewers, radio listeners, I'll read them off, of the big tech policy boards and
[22:36.000 --> 22:48.000]  Facebook, Twitter, and others to hire them on from the ADL Southern Poverty Law Center
[22:48.000 --> 22:54.000]  and several universities, which are also leftist academic groups, to build a consortium that
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  would then go in and engage in massive censorship.
[22:57.000 --> 22:58.000]  And it's been huge.
[22:58.000 --> 22:59.000]  You all know about that.
[22:59.000 --> 23:00.000]  You've seen it.
[23:00.000 --> 23:01.000]  Nothing can do with Nazis.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  They're left up so they can point at the threat.
[23:03.000 --> 23:06.000]  And by the way, I believe the Nazis have the free speech.
[23:06.000 --> 23:11.000]  The answer to bad speech is a good speech, just like I'm countering the very evil stuff
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  the ADL is putting out with my speech.
[23:13.000 --> 23:18.000]  They're calling for my complete silencing and my arrest and the heads of big tech arrest.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  We'll play this in a moment.
[23:20.000 --> 23:23.000]  But this is flaming tyranny.
[23:23.000 --> 23:28.000]  If this was an alcoholic beverage, it'd be 200 proof, pure alcohol.
[23:28.000 --> 23:29.000]  It was feces.
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  It'd be 100% crap.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  It was gold.
[23:33.000 --> 23:34.000]  It'd be 24 carat.
[23:34.000 --> 23:39.000]  I mean, this is the real deal.
[23:39.000 --> 23:42.000]  So let's go through some of these headlines.
[23:42.000 --> 23:48.000]  Sasha Barrett Cohen calls for global free speech purge and ADL takeover of all social media.
[23:48.000 --> 23:51.000]  Go see his full speech on infowars.com, my analysis.
[23:51.000 --> 23:56.000]  Here's an article from ADL.org, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, and ADL announced
[23:56.000 --> 24:02.000]  lab to engineer new solutions to stop cyber hate, and that was adopted by Google and others.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  You can read that.
[24:04.000 --> 24:08.000]  YouTube secretly using SPLC to police videos.
[24:08.000 --> 24:11.000]  Daily Caller goes on from there.
[24:11.000 --> 24:16.000]  Facebook, Amazon, Google, all working with the SPLC and ADL.
[24:16.000 --> 24:19.000]  But oh, who does he attack?
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.000]  Sasha Barrett Cohen attacks Stephen Miller, Mark Zuckerberg, Alex Jones, and ADL speech.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  He also attacks Breitbart and the presidents.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  So we've got to stop the Nazis.
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  Then he says our names.
[24:32.000 --> 24:36.000]  Total defamation.
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  And he says he speaks for all Jews.
[24:39.000 --> 24:42.000]  Think about how dangerous that is, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:42.000 --> 24:45.000]  He doesn't.
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  Who's being censored off the Internet?
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  Stephen Miller, Prager University.
[24:49.000 --> 24:52.000]  All these pro-American, pro-freedom Jews.
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  It's amazing, so dangerous, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.000]  When is somebody going to stand up politically and say no to Americans being bullied by multinational
[25:00.000 --> 25:05.000]  corporations with a bunch of multinationals in them overseeing what we can say and do?
[25:05.000 --> 25:11.000]  Facebook even hired a few years ago former Stasi heads to help run at the German secret
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  police from East Germany under the Soviets.
[25:13.000 --> 25:17.000]  And now Google's moving into the old Stasi building in East Germany.
[25:17.000 --> 25:18.000]  I'm not joking.
[25:18.000 --> 25:25.000]  Type in Google, moving in to old Stasi building.
[25:25.000 --> 25:27.000]  Let's continue.
[25:27.000 --> 25:31.000]  Sasha Baron Cohen has made his info wars, the Guardian.
[25:31.000 --> 25:35.000]  This was last year.
[25:35.000 --> 25:40.000]  I talk about chemicals in the water that make men effeminate and make frogs effeminate.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  That's signed to be a fact.
[25:42.000 --> 25:45.000]  And I said we should all know about this and know it's an agenda.
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.000]  So he got a crazy guy to try to blow people up in my name.
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  He talks about that in the speech.
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.000]  So because he could trick a crazy person in my name to do it, I'm the bad guy.
[25:55.000 --> 26:02.000]  When he's the one singing throw Jews down wells and doing all this crap.
[26:02.000 --> 26:09.000]  So again, he's obsessed with me because I'm organically popular and love liberty and he's a tyrant.
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  He's also obsessed with, look, Stephen Miller, who loves America, advises the president.
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  Writes his speeches.
[26:16.000 --> 26:17.000]  He wants him down.
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  What does the New York Times call him?
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.000]  A white nationalist.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  Yeah, pro-Israel Jew.
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.000]  Yeah, right.
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  This is just insane, ladies and gentlemen, but that's because the globalists are absolutely getting discredited.
[26:27.000 --> 26:31.000]  The problem is they're getting ready to make their big move.
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  What did they say?
[26:33.000 --> 26:40.000]  Thursday in the impeachment hearings, they said, Alex Jones says Fiona Hill worked for Soros and that she's a globalist.
[26:40.000 --> 26:44.000]  And they said, that's not true. I've never worked for Soros. I'm not a globalist.
[26:44.000 --> 26:45.000]  I am a leftist.
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.000]  She said he, you know, they are anti-Semites. Learned a dollar's design on crap.
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  What does it turn out happened?
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  She writes for the globalist.com.
[26:55.000 --> 26:59.000]  She runs his most powerful foundation on record.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  You know, but that's incredible lies.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  They know everybody's going to go, look it up.
[27:03.000 --> 27:04.000]  No, it's true.
[27:04.000 --> 27:10.000]  We're going to call you a Nazi and come after you if you don't submit to us.
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  And all it is is really a multinational corporate takeover.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  That's it.
[27:15.000 --> 27:18.000]  Schwarzenegger, you know, got caught praising Hitler and all this stuff.
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  His dad was an SS officer.
[27:20.000 --> 27:24.000]  He was a product of an, you know, his brother was of an SS arranged marriage.
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.000]  Schwarzenegger is a product of a German breeding program.
[27:27.000 --> 27:28.000]  And so he paid the, what was it?
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.000]  They deal like $10 million and they gave him an award and he could even wear his, even wears his Nazi belt buckle still.
[27:33.000 --> 27:37.000]  They just want cash and power.
[27:37.000 --> 27:44.000]  So if you're a real Nazi like Soros that, you know, Bragg said the best time of his life was rounding up Jews.
[27:44.000 --> 27:46.000]  Well, then everything's wonderful.
[27:46.000 --> 27:52.000]  You see, but if you're actually a pro America, pro freedom person and bring people together, well, they're going to get you shut down.
[27:52.000 --> 28:01.000]  I'm the number one enemy because I'm getting the right wing to not be anti-Semitic like the left wants to brand it and have them take the bait.
[28:01.000 --> 28:04.000]  Everybody come together and everybody buy into freedom.
[28:04.000 --> 28:06.000]  And then we defeat the whole globalist system together.
[28:06.000 --> 28:09.000]  But the globalists are counting on division.
[28:09.000 --> 28:17.000]  They all want to run their own little sub racial religious group and then play us off against each other and all the leaders of the groups get together and decide how to play us off against each other.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  I will not be part of that.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  Now, I'll get to all the clips of Fiona Hill.
[28:24.000 --> 28:32.000]  This is very dangerous because they've already almost got total censorship in, but he says that isn't enough.
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  We're going to arrest the big tech ads and we're going to purge.
[28:35.000 --> 28:36.000]  These are words he uses.
[28:36.000 --> 28:37.000]  Purge everyone.
[28:37.000 --> 28:43.000]  So, I mean, this is like Hitler on a stage in 1939 saying what he's going to do.
[28:43.000 --> 28:51.000]  He's already done a lot and it's happening again, ladies and gentlemen, and it's extremely dangerous, very, very dangerous.
[28:51.000 --> 28:58.000]  So I'm ringing the alarm here that this is they're making their move.
[28:58.000 --> 29:07.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  And I spent a lot of time thanking you.
[29:09.000 --> 29:17.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers.
[29:17.000 --> 29:24.000]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[29:24.000 --> 29:33.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[29:33.000 --> 29:39.000]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[29:39.000 --> 29:43.000]  So it's not a burden to support info wars.
[29:43.000 --> 29:54.000]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[29:54.000 --> 29:59.000]  So visit infowarstore.com today.
[29:59.000 --> 30:09.000]  Major report out of major university researchers working on food based treatment to slow aging science daily probiotics in the gut of a particular type.
[30:09.000 --> 30:14.000]  Cause your entire body to be healthier and make you live longer and make you not get intestinal cancer.

[30:17.000 --> 30:29.000]  And it explains the hormone called FGF21 pro longevity heals the entire body and actually reverses aging but is only made in the lower intestine.
[30:29.000 --> 30:30.000]  Oh, and what does it say?
[30:30.000 --> 30:35.000]  It's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries that grows this.
[30:35.000 --> 30:46.000]  And yes, this is a plug gut fusion and what do we have in this high auric berry blend strawberry blueberry blackberry cranberry escobio grape and pomegranate.
[30:46.000 --> 30:53.000]  It's the pulp from them that then grows this gut fusion for children for young people for old people for everybody.
[30:53.000 --> 30:55.000]  This is fiber and glutamine.
[30:55.000 --> 30:57.000]  You're not going to find a better formula gut fusion.
[30:57.000 --> 30:58.000]  It's amazing.
[30:58.000 --> 31:07.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[31:07.000 --> 31:10.000]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[31:10.000 --> 31:24.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[31:24.000 --> 31:28.000]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[31:28.000 --> 31:40.000]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswars.com, infowars.com and banned on video.
[31:40.000 --> 31:43.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever.
[31:43.000 --> 31:51.000]  And that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at infowars.com forward slash show and banned on video.
[31:51.000 --> 31:59.000]  So take heart, folks. They've had to censor everybody to shut everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[31:59.000 --> 32:10.000]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida, where he's always said he planned to retire to.
[32:10.000 --> 32:13.000]  And the left got so excited.
[32:13.000 --> 32:21.000]  They said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida.
[32:21.000 --> 32:26.000]  Well, now we know why the president did that. He knew the leftist controlled appeals courts.
[32:26.000 --> 32:33.000]  We're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got.
[32:33.000 --> 32:37.000]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with.
[32:37.000 --> 32:47.000]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[32:47.000 --> 32:52.000]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign.
[32:52.000 --> 33:09.000]  In his words, we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[33:09.000 --> 33:28.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[33:28.000 --> 33:34.000]  Well, I've said it over and over again and I'm going to say some positive things about President Trump the start of the next hour.
[33:34.000 --> 33:40.000]  And I didn't open the phones up. He really is the president. He makes mistakes.
[33:40.000 --> 33:51.000]  He's not perfect, but he's really trying to be the president, trying to be in charge, not letting the permanent bureaucracy and rogue bureaucratic elements tell him and the American people what to do.
[33:51.000 --> 33:55.000]  And he's really trying to faithfully execute on his promises to us.
[33:55.000 --> 34:04.000]  And so far I've given him an A plus for effort. He's let us down on fighting the censors and standing up for the First Amendment and done some other things that aren't good.
[34:04.000 --> 34:09.000]  But Eddie Gallagher controversy.
[34:09.000 --> 34:25.000]  Trump has fired the Navy Secretary amid Navy SEAL case Pentagon says that's just out Fox News posted info wars.com US Navy Secretary says he did not threaten to resign and dispute with Trump.
[34:25.000 --> 34:29.000]  And whether Trump's right or wrong on that he is the commander in chief.
[34:29.000 --> 34:45.000]  And he did pardon the Navy SEAL. And so the admirals under him that wanted to virtue signal and wanted to counterman the president.
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  Well, you got the chain of command ass backwards there, Jack.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  We're in command the American people and we elected Trump and he's in charge.
[34:52.000 --> 35:03.000]  You understand how that works? He's the chief executive, the most powerful person in this country. We put him there and he pardoned that individual so they don't lose their trident.
[35:03.000 --> 35:10.000]  Now, whether that's a mistake or not, if you got the military not following orders, what's going to happen real fast going to fall apart.
[35:10.000 --> 35:15.000]  So your ass is fired. And I totally support what the president did.
[35:15.000 --> 35:24.000]  He's to start firing a lot more people. Let's try to get Steve Pachinic on the show tomorrow about this. Just about Trump needs to start firing thousands of people.
[35:24.000 --> 35:29.000]  He's to put people in charge to get things set up to get the bureaucrats, the deep state out of there.
[35:29.000 --> 35:33.000]  Now let's get back to the top story. This is so big.
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  I'll cover this for our next hour.
[35:36.000 --> 35:43.000]  The ADL is an intelligence agency. They got caught breaking into police stations stealing files on people in the 80s and 90s.
[35:43.000 --> 35:53.000]  They lost a bunch of lawsuits where people in Hollywood, if somebody didn't sell theater chain or do whatever the ADL said, they would come out and say they were a Nazi.
[35:53.000 --> 35:59.000]  And then the folks sued and won huge lawsuits because that was wrong.
[35:59.000 --> 36:06.000]  The ADL is a multinational private intelligence agency.
[36:06.000 --> 36:11.000]  And they got in a lot of trouble by the 2000s, so they kind of hid in the shadows.
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.000]  And now they've come out as one of the lead groups running the censorship, all of this.
[36:16.000 --> 36:28.000]  And they have had Saucerberg Cohen, the washed up comedian, who just had a whole raft of movies demonizing Trump and Patriots that all failed miserably.
[36:28.000 --> 36:37.000]  People are sick of it, just like the new Charlie's Angels is a anti-Trump, anti-America, anti-family, you know, third wave feminist joke, total failure.
[36:37.000 --> 36:41.000]  People just are sick of it. So the left's answers, more and more.
[36:41.000 --> 36:48.000]  Well, the hysteria that grips the left has now attestatized even greater into the brains of the folks of the ADL.
[36:48.000 --> 37:03.000]  And they have jumped the Megalodon megashark here and said, we want to arrest, starting with Mark Zuckerberg, all six heads, all six of the big tech heads.
[37:03.000 --> 37:10.000]  And we want everybody shut down. We want to purge. These are quotes because they're all Nazis.
[37:10.000 --> 37:16.000]  Now, even if we were Nazis, we don't deserve to be purged, but that's not true.
[37:16.000 --> 37:29.000]  And they go on to say any criticism of, towards florals who pumps a lot of money into them, hundreds of millions over the years, will result in them telling banks, you name it, that you're a Nazi.
[37:29.000 --> 37:35.000]  And these damn banks need to be sued. And there's, these congressional actions, they will take away your merchant accounts.
[37:35.000 --> 37:44.000]  They will kick you offline. I mean, just like Hitler did, guys, go to YouTube and type in, Nazis throw Jews out of their businesses and shops.
[37:44.000 --> 37:53.000]  Nazis ban Jews from business. There's all the famous footage of the Jews being thrown out of their businesses and the windows being knocked out and yellow stars being painted on them.
[37:53.000 --> 38:04.000]  And that really went on. And I'm sorry that happened, but I don't deserve that. My windows knocked out just because, you know, I'm, I'm, I'm a conservative and a nationalist.
[38:04.000 --> 38:16.000]  And I'm not going to put up with it. But that's what's happened to our merchant accounts and to NRA groups and conservatives and Laura Loomer and strangely people that are conservatives and pro-Israel.
[38:16.000 --> 38:23.000]  There's a whole civil war going on, obviously, you know, when the Rothschilds, they've made that public and Netanyahu, they're going to put in prison.
[38:23.000 --> 38:35.000]  So it's not monolithic, you know, group we're here talking about, but the ADL represents, you know, the most powerful Jewish organization in the world.
[38:35.000 --> 38:46.000]  It's basically Bene Brith and the international brotherhood and sisterhood and whoever they point their finger at, like a mob, they come for you to lynch your ass.
[38:46.000 --> 38:54.000]  And man, it's, it's rough. I mean, it's, it's, I mean, here's, here's footage right here, Nazi Germany, Jewish boycott.
[38:54.000 --> 39:03.000]  Now let's just keep rolling that for folks because this, this is what happened. And it's rough.
[39:03.000 --> 39:09.000]  This is what's happened to Christians and conservatives and nationalists and patriots and conservative Jews.
[39:09.000 --> 39:17.000]  I mean, if you don't, I mean, literally the ADL is endorsing sexualization of children, transgenderism, the brainwashing, just everything evil.
[39:17.000 --> 39:26.000]  Every leftist agenda there is, the ADL is now adopted and then adds you're a Nazi if you don't submit to it.
[39:26.000 --> 39:27.000]  So let's skip ahead a little bit.
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.000]  I mean, here you go, putting up signs that you can't shop there and then it's knocked the windows out everything else.
[39:33.000 --> 39:39.000]  And that's what they're saying. Don't shop with conservatives.
[39:39.000 --> 39:46.000]  Don't go to their sites. Don't let them have credit cards. Don't let them communicate on WhatsApp on Facebook.
[39:46.000 --> 39:51.000]  Zuckerberg says you cannot say Alex Jones's name unless you say it a negative connotation.
[39:51.000 --> 39:59.000]  And to that all advised by the ADL on record to show you the articles last segment, their answer is that's not enough.
[39:59.000 --> 40:05.000]  That's all superficial.
[40:05.000 --> 40:09.000]  And now they're saying 88 the number 88 Seville.
[40:09.000 --> 40:13.000]  If you don't like anti fuck criminal method group.
[40:13.000 --> 40:21.000]  Cross the fist symbol. This is all just pure crap, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:21.000 --> 40:24.000]  So.
[40:24.000 --> 40:30.000]  And it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse and worse.
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.000]  The Celtic cross. Give me a break.
[40:34.000 --> 40:38.000]  And now, of course, the bro fist.
[40:38.000 --> 40:44.000]  So, so, so, oh, the fascist symbol. You see that that's in the U.S. Senate.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  Guys type stop for a second.
[40:48.000 --> 40:51.000]  Go to the U.S. Senate for me online. Just just pull up video of the U.S. Senate.
[40:51.000 --> 40:54.000]  And right behind the dias is the fasci.
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.000]  You know, the buildings are all Greek and Roman style.
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.000]  But let me start getting to these videos as I promised to do.
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  Okay, should have just led the show with this.
[41:02.000 --> 41:07.000]  But here's the ADL spokesperson.
[41:07.000 --> 41:12.000]  Let's go to Sasha and the ADL on Alex Jones. Here it is.
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  And the trigger outrage and fear.
[41:14.000 --> 41:22.000]  It's why YouTube recommended videos by the conspiracist Alex Jones billions of times.
[41:22.000 --> 41:29.000]  It's why fake news outperforms real news because studies show that lies spread faster than truth.
[41:29.000 --> 41:36.000]  And it's no surprise that the greatest propaganda machine in history has spread the oldest conspiracy theory in history.
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.000]  The lie that Jews are somehow dangerous.
[41:40.000 --> 41:46.000]  As one headline put it, just think what Goebbels could have done with Facebook.
[41:46.000 --> 41:52.000]  On the Internet, everything can appear equally legitimate.
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  Breitbart resembles the BBC.
[41:54.000 --> 42:00.000]  The fictitious protocols of the Elders of Zion look as valid as an ADL report.
[42:00.000 --> 42:06.000]  And behind him, it says never is now, you know, never again, never is now.
[42:06.000 --> 42:10.000]  That's right. You are the Nazi element. You are the ones coming for our freedom.
[42:10.000 --> 42:15.000]  The left, the communist left, the communist ADL, a big part of that.
[42:15.000 --> 42:19.000]  He goes on to worship Antifa, a terror group that attacks men, women and children.
[42:19.000 --> 42:24.000]  The attacks mainline prayer groups that have opened satanic rallies,
[42:24.000 --> 42:30.000]  hailing Satan, calling for pedophilia. We're going to go to break and I'll get to all the clips here.
[42:30.000 --> 42:38.000]  But to see this type of authoritarianism rise its ugly head is simply incredible.
[42:38.000 --> 42:43.000]  And the closest thing we've ever seen of this is the Nazis and the Soviet Russians.
[42:43.000 --> 42:49.000]  And America is about to get a big dose of it because the ADL is already drunk on the blood of the First Amendment.
[42:49.000 --> 42:55.000]  It wants it all now. He's going to call for our imprisonment next. When we come back, let's put people in prison.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  He wants us in prison.
[42:59.000 --> 43:05.000]  Beto Roark came out dozens of times and said, we're going to confiscate all your semi-automatic rifles.
[43:05.000 --> 43:11.000]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage, nine others, to agree and said that he was a hero.
[43:11.000 --> 43:16.000]  Think about that. Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[43:16.000 --> 43:26.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[43:26.000 --> 43:33.000]  They know what they're doing. And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  for what criminals do using their firearms. My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[43:39.000 --> 43:45.000]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment
[43:45.000 --> 43:51.000]  and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[43:51.000 --> 43:57.000]  So you see, a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens. Well, we could ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[43:57.000 --> 44:03.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[44:03.000 --> 44:11.000]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[44:11.000 --> 44:20.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[44:20.000 --> 44:26.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[44:26.000 --> 44:35.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there is no free will, there's no devil or the God.
[44:35.000 --> 44:45.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[44:45.000 --> 44:51.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us. Oxford's banned clapping.
[44:51.000 --> 44:58.000]  University's the U.S. have banned 21 guns to loot for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[44:58.000 --> 45:10.000]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida where he's always said he planned to retire to.
[45:10.000 --> 45:21.000]  And the left got so excited they said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida.
[45:21.000 --> 45:34.000]  Well, now we know why the president did that. He knew the leftist controlled appeals courts. We're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got.
[45:34.000 --> 45:47.000]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with. And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[45:47.000 --> 45:59.000]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign. In his words, we're kicking the deep state's ass and he's never going to resign.
[45:59.000 --> 46:10.000]  There's a famous quote by Marine Corps General in the Korean War when three million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[46:10.000 --> 46:20.000]  More than 50 to one, some estimates have it. But the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told, General, we're completely surrounded.
[46:20.000 --> 46:30.000]  He said, good, we can attack in all directions. Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached. And it really is epic. It really is biblical.
[46:30.000 --> 46:40.000]  And we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support. But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete.
[46:40.000 --> 46:53.000]  And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[46:53.000 --> 47:02.000]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform, that checkmates the globalist.
[47:02.000 --> 47:14.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:14.000 --> 47:20.000]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[47:20.000 --> 47:27.000]  So you turn on mainstream media news on a word about communist China killing over 100 million of their own people.
[47:27.000 --> 47:36.000]  It's four or five times as Hitler did. Not a word about them selling political distance organs or massacring people or working with big tech to censor overseas and now here.
[47:36.000 --> 47:42.000]  But Trump, you hear, talks about it. That's good.
[47:42.000 --> 47:57.000]  You see the tyranny on the universities, no free speech, supposedly places that are bashings of it. And you see all the brainwashing of little kids and all the racial division being pushed by the left and all the sexualization of the children, just all the corruption.
[47:57.000 --> 48:08.000]  And then you see the so-called civil rights organizations, the ACLU on the Soros payroll.
[48:08.000 --> 48:14.000]  They're being anti-free speech, wanting to pass hate crimes laws and restrict speech.
[48:14.000 --> 48:30.000]  And you see Sacha Barrico and that made all his money doing outrageous gags, a lot of illegal, trying to get people to do illegal things, trying to have sex with Ron Paul, trying to get my listeners to kill people.
[48:30.000 --> 48:39.000]  They're not the speech. So you get attributed to me, finding mentally ill individuals who they could try to tie to M4s.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  Well, he reached tens of millions. Of course, they can find a few of those.
[48:42.000 --> 48:55.000]  This is a real monster, but he's just a spokesperson of bigger monsters who think you are stupid and who think you don't see through what's happening.
[48:55.000 --> 49:01.000]  The illustration of this at the moment, probably one of the biggest ones and best ones ever. But first, let's get to these other clips.
[49:01.000 --> 49:07.000]  Here he is saying purge pre-speech via big tech. Here it is.
[49:07.000 --> 49:20.000]  There is such a thing as objective truth. Facts do exist. And if these internet companies really want to make a difference, they should hire enough monitors to actually monitor.
[49:20.000 --> 49:34.000]  Work closely with groups like the ADL and the NAACP, insist on facts and purge these lies and conspiracies from their platforms.
[49:34.000 --> 49:49.000]  So there you go. Purge them from the platform. And then he goes on to talk about purging them across the world as well.
[49:49.000 --> 49:58.000]  But let's hear that one more time. Let's hear the arrest them.
[49:58.000 --> 50:09.000]  Maybe fines aren't enough. You've already allowed foreign powers to interfere in election and genocide.
[50:09.000 --> 50:19.000]  The whole Russia-gate fake thing. And oh, some people used the internet to have a race war in another country. So it's big tech's fault.
[50:19.000 --> 50:27.000]  Like if somebody uses a telephone to call in a bomb threat, is it AT&T's fault? Or if somebody uses a telephone to say they're holding hostages, is it AT&T's fault? No.
[50:27.000 --> 50:33.000]  But that's what he's saying. And he's talking about arresting the big tech heads. Here's the clip.
[50:33.000 --> 50:48.000]  And maybe fines are not enough. Maybe it's time to tell Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of these companies you already allowed one foreign power to interfere in our elections.
[50:48.000 --> 50:57.000]  You already facilitated one genocide in Myanmar. Do it again and you go to jail.
[50:57.000 --> 51:06.000]  Do it again and you go to jail because the ADL is the boss.
[51:06.000 --> 51:15.000]  Alan Obama and Hillary fund the year of spring and use Google and Apple and Facebook to start giant riots and then put ISIS and Al Qaeda in charge and millions die.
[51:15.000 --> 51:24.000]  Hundreds of thousands of women and children put in sex slavery. That's okay. That's okay.
[51:24.000 --> 51:37.000]  Global telecommunication systems must be handed over to the ADL, he says. And then he goes on to say you need to hire more moderators and that of course is the ADL itself.
[51:37.000 --> 51:46.000]  I just showed you the article earlier. He doesn't mention that in the speech. Oh, there's this global crisis. The Nazis are coming. Oh, to seize our communications and put us in jail.
[51:46.000 --> 51:54.000]  I mean you. But the truth is the communists are coming.
[51:54.000 --> 52:12.000]  There's such a thing as objective facts, facts to exist going said, and if these internet companies really want to make a difference, they should hire some enough monitors to actually monitor work closely with groups like ADL and system facts and purge these liars and
[52:12.000 --> 52:18.000]  interracies from their platforms. You see that quote?
[52:18.000 --> 52:27.000]  I'm reading that quote to you on air right now. That's what he said.
[52:27.000 --> 52:47.000]  Let's go ahead and play the hire the moderator club in, in every other industry, a company can be held liable when their product is defective. When engines explode or seatbelts malfunction, car companies recall tens of thousands of vehicles at a cost of billions of dollars.
[52:47.000 --> 53:04.000]  It only seems fair to say to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, your product is defective. You are obliged to fix it, no matter how much it costs and no matter how many moderators you need to employ.
[53:04.000 --> 53:21.000]  The speech is simply incredible and for brevity, I told me at those clips, they cut the cheering off, the whooping, the cheering, the cat calling. It's incredible. I mean, you would think those people are having an orgasm with we're going to arrest the big tech heads.
[53:21.000 --> 53:24.000]  They don't do what we say. We're going to purge the internet.
[53:24.000 --> 53:36.000]  The ADL will tell them what to do. Yay. Yeah, we'll run everything. Well, that's not scary at all.
[53:36.000 --> 53:55.000]  And that's where we are as a civilization. And so people say, oh, this is crazy. They'll never get away with that. But that's exactly where all of this is going.
[53:55.000 --> 54:15.000]  I'm going to go ahead and play the Fiona Hill testimony clip seven here tonight on the Sunday broadcast because the ADL came out and again said fire Stephen Miller Jewish because he's a white supremacist.
[54:15.000 --> 54:18.000]  That's the New York Times ADL.
[54:18.000 --> 54:31.000]  And again, the ADL called a bottle of ketchup a nuclear bomb. The people go, it's a nuclear bomb. If they called this this this can of orange flavored water, PCP, I'd be arrested not go officers.
[54:31.000 --> 54:43.000]  It's water. They go, the ADL said it's PCP. You're being executed today. There's no judge. There's no jury. There's only ADL, the Lord, the Savior, the King, the God, the master, just like the Southern Poverty Law Center and all these other groups.
[54:43.000 --> 54:52.000]  They just have to do what they say. Like Brian Williams said he got shot down a helicopter. He's still on TV. He wasn't shot down a helicopter. He's a liar.
[54:52.000 --> 54:59.000]  If Fiona Hill got up there and they had the congressman say, you don't work for Soros and you know nothing about globalism. She goes, that's right.
[54:59.000 --> 55:09.000]  Well, she works for a publication called the globalist.com. She headed up as the top board member. His main foundation, the open society foundation, that's all in her own bio.
[55:09.000 --> 55:21.000]  So she's perjuring herself to Congress. And then they go on to say it's anti-Semitic to say that Soros has got all these State Department people in there and that Hillary has stay behind networks in there like Fiona Hill that we exposed.
[55:21.000 --> 55:25.000]  And all of that is completely true. Let's start getting to this clip.
[55:25.000 --> 55:37.000]  Good afternoon. Thank you so much for coming in and thank you for your service. Dr. Hill, you stated in your deposition you've been accused of being a mole for George Soros in the White House, correct?
[55:37.000 --> 55:54.000]  That's correct. You said in your deposition specifically a conspiracy was launched against you by convicted felon Roger Stone on the show Infowars led by Alex Jones, right?
[55:54.000 --> 56:04.000]  I don't think it was a convicted felon at the time that he launched this, so I didn't use those exact words. But it was indeed Roger Stone and Alex Jones on Infowars in 2017.
[56:04.000 --> 56:16.000]  And in fact, just more recently, before Mr. Stone was endured his trial, they were at it again reprising the same Infowars video and adding embellishments.
[56:16.000 --> 56:33.000]  And they said, I'll quote what they said about you, we here at Infowars, this is Roger Stone speaking, first identified Fiona Hill, the globalist leftist George Soros Insider who had infiltrated McMaster's staff.
[56:33.000 --> 56:40.000]  And you said that on May 31, 2017. I presume you're not a globalist leftist Soros Insider, correct?
[56:40.000 --> 56:44.000]  I think my coal mining family would be very surprised to hear all of these things about me.
[56:44.000 --> 56:45.000]  I agree.
[56:45.000 --> 56:50.000]  Leftist perhaps not so much, but anyway, the left in Europe is a bit different from the left here. Let's put it that way.
[56:50.000 --> 57:02.000]  I agree. Interestingly, you stated in your deposition that a similar conspiracy theory had actually been launched against Marie Yovanovich.
[57:02.000 --> 57:09.000]  And you said specifically, when I saw this happening to Ambassador Yovanovich, again, I was furious.
[57:09.000 --> 57:21.000]  Because this is, again, just this whipping up of what is frankly an anti-semitic conspiracy theory about George Soros to basically target nonpartisan career officials.
[57:21.000 --> 57:22.000]  Isn't that what you said?
[57:22.000 --> 57:23.000]  I did say that, yes.
[57:23.000 --> 57:34.000]  And I'm sure you've been watching with concern what's happened to other nonpartisan career officials. We had Alex, Lieutenant Colonel Alex Vindman.
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.000]  All right, let's stop right here. By the way, I didn't even know Vindman was Jewish, so he's a little globalist lion mole.
[57:39.000 --> 57:43.000]  We say, oh my gosh, he's Jewish. You're an anti-semitic.
[57:43.000 --> 57:49.000]  You see, these criminals are hiding behind this. I mean, that's what's going on, hour two coming up.
[57:49.000 --> 57:58.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the M4s, the family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[58:00.000 --> 58:07.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers.
[58:07.000 --> 58:14.000]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[58:14.000 --> 58:19.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[58:19.000 --> 58:23.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[58:23.000 --> 58:29.000]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[58:29.000 --> 58:33.000]  So it's not a burden to support info wars.
[58:33.000 --> 58:43.000]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life
[58:43.000 --> 58:44.000]  so much better.
[58:44.000 --> 58:49.000]  So visit infowarstore.com today.
[58:49.000 --> 58:56.000]  Major report out of major university, researchers working on food-based treatment to slow aging science daily,
[58:56.000 --> 59:04.000]  probiotics in the gut of a particular type, cause your entire body to be healthier and make you live longer and make you not get intestinal cancer.
[59:04.000 --> 59:14.000]  We have the very best formula, literally, with what they even mentioned in the studies, and it explains that the hormone called FGF21, pro longevity, heals the entire body,
[59:14.000 --> 59:19.000]  and actually reverses aging, but is only made in the lower intestine.
[59:19.000 --> 59:20.000]  Oh, and what does it say?
[59:20.000 --> 59:25.000]  It's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries that grows this.
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  And yes, this is a plug, gut fusion.
[59:27.000 --> 59:36.000]  And what do we have in this high auric berry blend, strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, cranberry, escoblio, grape, and pomegranate?
[59:36.000 --> 59:39.000]  It's the pulp from them that then grows this.
[59:39.000 --> 59:43.000]  Gut fusion for children, for young people, for old people, for everybody.
[59:43.000 --> 59:45.000]  This is fiber and glutamine.
[59:45.000 --> 59:46.000]  You're not going to find a better formula.
[59:46.000 --> 59:47.000]  Gut fusion, it's amazing.
[59:47.000 --> 59:58.000]  Infowarswar.com
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  You, you have, you have me.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:40.000]  All right, so the ADL is being rolled out as the new weapon to stop the reinsurgence of America.
[1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  The demonized Trump is an anti-Semite.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  You've already been hearing that for years.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:58.000]  It's asinine and to basically black ball shun and economically destroy with true blacklist, like the red list, but, but, but for real, like what they claim conservatives did to communist back in the 1950s.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  It's here.
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  It's happening now.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  And so getting back to the hearings, the reason I'm harping on this is not because I'm being attacked by Sasha Baron Cohen or not because I'm being attacked by the ADL or not because I'm being attacked in Congress and I can't face my accuser.
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  It's that this is the big move.
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  Even the national review gets it right.
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  The ADL chooses anti-Trump over anti-Semitism and will totally destroy the group once and for all.
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  I mean, this is criminal in my view because if there was a Jewish organization standing up to defamation or whatever, standing up for Jews, great.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  I have a civil rights group for every group and I'm really trying to bring folks together here and then there's diverse people in every group.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  So I refuse to be a racist tribalist, but the ADL is actually just like Hitler here.
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  That's just another tribal group.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  People act like this when you get all tribal and, you know, get all elitists like this and, you know, it's wrong.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  It's really wrong and it's criminal.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  But we're still here on air despite Soros and the ADL and others trying to shut us down and we refuse to get down to their race-baiting, race-pushing level because we're better than them.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  We are.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  And we're not who they say we are.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  We're not who they are.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  Now, let's go ahead and go back to Fiona Hill and the learned elders of Zion.
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  I mean, who even talks about that, but it's always being put back out by the ADL and then the left and, oh, that's where it came from that we don't like Soros.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  No, he went on 60 Minutes and said he loved what he did rounding up Jews.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  That's where that comes from.
[1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  And then the globalists were trying to overthrow Ukraine and Trump's investigating it.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  That's why we're not saying it's Jews, but they inject that into the discussion.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000]  Here it is.
[1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:08.000]  And an American immigrant questioned for his criticism of the president in a very unfair way, you know, basically questioning his loyalty to the country.
[1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  I believe that he's also of Ukrainian Jewish descent.
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Would you say that these different theories, these conspiracy theories that have been targeting you spun in part by folks like Mr. Stone, as well as fueled by Rudy Giuliani.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  And others basically have a tinge of anti-Semitism to them at least.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  Well, certainly when they involve George Soros, they do.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  I just like to point out that in the early 1900s, the Tsarist secret police produced something called the protocols of the Elders of Zion, which actually you can still obtain on the Internet.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  And you can buy it actually sometimes in bookshops.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  You can still read it online and still get it in bookstores. Oh, we better burn those books like the Nazis did. Let's keep going.
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  Sometimes in bookshops in Russia and elsewhere.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  This is the longest running anti-Semitic trope that we have in history.
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  And the trope against Mr. Soros George Soros was also created for political purposes.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  And this is the new protocols of the Elders of Zion.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  I'll tell you enough. Let me just hit this document cam shot, please.
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:20.000]  Again, she's not a globalist.
[1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  There's nothing about it. This is from Wikipedia.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  A chairwoman on the board of the Open Society Institute.
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  The main foundation created and run by George Soros.
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  Here is her. I'm a senior writer at The Globalist.
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  That's for world government and promotes George Soros.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  And then she also gets money from the Ford Foundation and actually is the main printer of the Elders of Zion.
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  So she gets money from the main group that puts that up.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  Can't make that up.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  And of course, we are the ones that expose. She was a Soros mole and they're pissed about it.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  So she's hiding behind anti-Semitism.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  I don't think you're Jewish, lady. You do look like a Prince Valiant, though.
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  We'll be right back in FullWars.com tomorrow's news today.
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  I've made a lot of predictions that have come true.
[1:05:02.000 --> 1:05:08.000]  But I'm here to tell you that most of those really weren't predictions that came out of a crystal ball.
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.000]  I could see where the globalists were going.
[1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:14.000]  I could see what their in-game agenda was, what their goal was.
[1:05:14.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  And I knew that when they were setting a sub-PD platform,
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  that they were really setting the precedent to take everybody off air,
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  to silence everyone, to ban words and names and information on fake whistleblowers
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  so that their false narratives couldn't be opposed.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  What the globalists really feared was independent media and platforms in the future.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  It was the model of FullWars as much as the information that had to be silenced
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  because they need total information dominance for their outrageous lies
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  and the evil they're pushing to succeed.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  And that's why keeping in FullWars on the air is now more imperative and more vital than ever.
[1:06:20.000 --> 1:06:24.000]  50,000 unstoppable Watts.
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:32.000]  So, did you hear?
[1:06:32.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  I'm a white supremacist Nazi.
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  So's Rush Limbaugh. So's Tucker Carlson.
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.000]  So's Donald Trump.
[1:06:40.000 --> 1:06:44.000]  So is Stephen Miller, one of his top advisors.
[1:06:44.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  So's Michelle Malkin.
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:52.000]  And we've got mainline Republican groups firing Michelle Malkin and people like that
[1:06:52.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  because Turning Point USA says it's anti-Semitic to support free speech.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  That's right, Michelle Malkin said she supported the free speech of college groups
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:08.000]  that were protesting Turning Point USA and she got fired from her long-time job
[1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  at a conservative think tank.
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  So when the ADL snaps its fingers and when the left snaps its fingers,
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  people say yes, sir, boss.
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  Because it's not that anybody's really anti-Semitic,
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  even though you have that right in a free country.
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  It's that that's the order from the left that you are to be destroyed
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  or they're going to destroy you.
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  And so the big takeaway is when is America going to stand up to this
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  and how do we stand up to it?
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  And Trump's big failing is that big tech is censoring,
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  being run by the Southern Property Law Center, ADL and others on record.
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  And Trump's just allowing this racketeering, this election meddling, this persecution
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  that is now economic going at people's businesses and bank accounts
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  just like the Nazis first did in 1933-34 against the Jews.
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  The parallels are completely there and run side by side.
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  But the truth is, communists and other authoritarians act just like this as well.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  The Nazis were borrowing pages out of the Soviets and out of the Trotskyites.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:24.000]  So this is well trodden ground for the ADL.
[1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  And if it worked in Russia so splendidly,
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  I guess folks think it's going to work here in America.
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  Well, I assure you not without a fight over my dead body.
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:40.000]  And sometimes that's what ends up happening, right?
[1:08:40.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  Well, okay.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  But I assure the establishment that this is not going to go well.
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  Your attempt to install that witch Hillary hadn't gone well.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  Everything else you've done hasn't gone well.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  Instead of just leaving people alone and letting Americans live like they want to
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  and do like they want to instead of leaving our kids alone,
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  that is so obsessed with it that the ADL has endorsed sexualization of children,
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  pedo, story time, all the rest of it.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  And it's wrong.
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:20.000]  And I've harped on this a long time today because it's central to everything we face.
[1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  And again, I shot a report on this Friday and a lot of people said,
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  oh, who cares about Sacha Barrico and he's a washed up actor.
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  Well, what he is is a chameleon socialist whose every role is to put down Christians
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  and nationalists and patriots and to teach antisemitism.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  Guys, pull up, throw the Jew down the well song off YouTube, please.
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  He goes into a bar one at night.
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  Everybody gets drunk.
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  He sings the first few rounds of the song and then adds Jew down the well to it.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  So he can trick a group of Americans and make America look bad, but he's the Piper.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:08.000]  It's like selling fentanyl or heroin to 12 year olds and then saying,
[1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  you know, look, they're a bunch of bad heroin addicts.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  It's six months later.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  Now get the audio ready.
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  When you're ready, give me a thumbs up.
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  So that's how this whole system operates, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  And the left wants to make their takeover, their censorship, their sexualization of children,
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  their destruction of the borders, their bankrupting the country about race.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  And so they're just going to inject now that you're anti-Semitic if you think the country should exist
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  or that you're pro-gun.
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  And to do that, they're going to have the ADL come out and superimpose this.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  I mean, aren't people smart enough to see what's going on here?
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:02.000]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  Hillary's behind in the polls.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  She knows she's behind in the real polls.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  And then Professor tells her intensify culture war, racial, religious, and the war between the sexes.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  R-R-S.
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  And that's all this is cold blooded.
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  Cold blooded.
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  I never heard about racism and all this crap till I started going to college.
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  And then that's all I heard about because that's where they do it.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  It's where they infect everybody's brains and turn everybody in these little victims
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  so that they're not thinking about how to make money or be successful or be good Americans.
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.000]  Or how to work together.
[1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  They're just thinking about what color somebody is or what they look like or where they came from
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  to break us up, to balkanize us, to control us.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  And that's all dirtbags in Hollywood and others are doing.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  And we're smarter than that.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:04.000]  So here is Sasha Baron Cohen who also in his ADL speech again said,
[1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  and I've got the London Guardian reporting it,
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  Sasha Baron Cohen's Info War.
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  And he remembered me saying there's chemicals in the water to encourage males to be homosexual and to be feminized.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  And that's in all the studies and it makes the frogs the same way.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  Makes fish, makes shrimp.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  Try to have sex with the same sex with the males.
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  And then it causes population collapse.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  So he went out and tried to whack out somebody to blow people up
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.000]  who he said were putting chemicals in diapers to make the baby boys gay.
[1:12:34.000 --> 1:12:40.000]  Which actually do put chemical liners in there that are doing that and came out in a big Harvard study last week
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:46.000]  that most of the miscarriages are caused by chemicals that are in plastic lining.
[1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Anybody can type in.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  Chemicals and plastics increasing miscarriages.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  This is all a fact.
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:56.000]  But he tried to get somebody to blow people up.
[1:12:56.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  And at the end of his speech he goes,
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  evil people like Alex Jones are using the Internet to lead people to do bad things.
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  He's the one that does this.
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  He knows that.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  The whole speech is about a satanic conversion.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  Well, everything he says about us, he's doing.
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  I don't go around teaching people throw the Jew down the well so my country can be free.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  Then he doesn't just get these poor rednecks to do that.
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  He then gets the Jews up there to say get rid of the freedom.
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Throw the Jew down the well so my country can be free.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  Now Jews, let's throw their free speech down the well.
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:40.000]  Then he gets the Jews to go throw the free speech down the well so everybody attack us.
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  Let's see, he didn't write the script.
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:44.000]  He's worked for the ADL all along, it turns out.
[1:13:44.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  And we're finding connections to Soros funded groups in England and MI6.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  Of course, ladies and gentlemen, everything he does is about racial division and breaking society down.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  So here he is teaching people anti-Semitism and that Jews want to take your freedom and that Jews are dangerous.
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  And now he's up there saying Jews are coming for your speech.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  In the making plays a bunch of songs, lets them have fun.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  Then he does this and sets them up.
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:25.000]  Go to it.
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  This is a song called Moga Zrobica Domo von.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  It's been in my country there is a problem.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  In my country there is problem and that problem is transport.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:58.000]  It takes very, very long because Kazakhstan is big.
[1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  So transport down the well.
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  So my country can be free, so my country can be free.
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  We must make travel easier than we have a big party.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  In my country there is problem and that problem is the Jews.
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  They take everybody's money, they never give it back.
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  So the Jews down the well, so my country can be free.
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  You must have nice ones than we have a big party.
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  So there you go, so your country can be free.
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:58.000]  Sasha, can my country be free Sasha?
[1:15:58.000 --> 1:16:02.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson.
[1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:10.000]  What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[1:16:10.000 --> 1:16:12.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit?
[1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil, it is a bottomless pit.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist.
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:33.000]  Or that there is no free will, there is no devil or the God.
[1:16:33.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  Oxford's Band Clapping.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:53.000]  University of the U.S. of Band 21 gun salutes for veterans.
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  There's a famous quote by a Marine Corps general in the Korean War when 3 million Chai comms had flooded across the border and surrounded the Marines.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:12.000]  More than 50 to 1 some estimates have it.
[1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  But the point is they were outnumbered and the general was told, general, we're completely surrounded.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  He said, good, we can attack in all directions.
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:25.000]  Well, that's the point that Info Wars has reached.
[1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:31.000]  And it really is epic, it really is biblical and we wouldn't have gone this far without all your support.
[1:17:31.000 --> 1:17:38.000]  But it's going to become more critical than ever as the censorship becomes complete.
[1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  And it's not just Americans, but folks all over the world are completely silenced when it comes to speaking the name of a CIA fake whistleblower or exposing a pedophile or speaking out against dangerous vaccines.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:55.000]  Because by Info Wars having its own platform, that checkmate's the globalist.
[1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:09.000]  About a month ago, President Trump announced that he was going to move his domicile from New York City to Florida, where he's always said he planned to retire to.
[1:18:09.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  And the left got so excited, they said, oh, he's about to resign and leave instead of facing impeachment and he's running to Florida.
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  Well, now we know why the president did that. He knew the left is controlled appeals courts.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:31.000]  We're going to say that he had to give up his tax returns so they can pour over them and harass every business partner he's got.
[1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  They want to terrorize people that he's worked with.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  And by moving his domicile from New York to Florida, that gets around the New York law they passed to get his tax returns that are supposed to be private.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:56.000]  So all those people out there holding their breath for the president to resign, in his words, we're kicking the deep states ass and he's never going to resign.
[1:18:56.000 --> 1:19:05.000]  Infowarstore.com, we have a new product and we got several thousand of these in and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:16.000]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game changing toothpaste and it doesn't compete with super blue.
[1:19:16.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  The adult or the children's. These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers. People love it.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re mineralizes the teeth.
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:38.000]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause ginsivitis. This is all proven.
[1:19:38.000 --> 1:19:50.000]  You can make claims with this, but I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[1:19:50.000 --> 1:19:59.000]  So we're really proud of it. It funds the operation. Infowarstore.com. That's why we're still on air. Thanks to you.
[1:19:59.000 --> 1:20:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:02.000 --> 1:20:29.000]  You are either with the Republic or against it. Resistance to Titans is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm here live on air. Then I come back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  But don't forget we've got the David Knight Show 8 a.m. weekdays right here on the InfoWars Radio TV Network.
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  Find all the videos, all the archives, the live feeds at band.video and share that link, band.video and infowars.com forward slash show.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  The Globals really hope you don't.
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:21:08.000]  Now I want to shift gears and do a lot of other news and a lot of other information. But since I've been harping on it this long, I'm going to play a report here in a moment where I break down what the ADL and Saucerbaric Owen are doing.
[1:21:08.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  So let's get that queued up, please. About a seven minute report that will come back and hit all the other news. I haven't hit yet.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:24.000]  But the ADL coming out and saying arrest the heads of Big Tech and coming out and saying purge everybody's free speech in the same paragraph with my name.
[1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:31.000]  This is a total declaration of war. This is a very dangerous organization and they've been caught breaking into police stations, you name it.
[1:21:31.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  So please pray for InfoWars and please financially support us and try to keep us on air. We've got great products you already need.

[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  Here's part of the report that I'm going to be airing in full tomorrow and then I'll come back into the other news.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  But this deals with how dangerous it is to have the ADL openly saying they're going to take over every organization in America and arrest anyone that doesn't submit to them.
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:04.000]  Here it is.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  This has come out and issued a public statement at their main conference calling for the arrest of the big six tech heads if they do not fully turn control of their company's moderation and content over to them.
[1:23:49.000 --> 1:23:53.000]  This is literal terrorism.
[1:23:53.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  And maybe fines are not enough. Maybe it's time to tell Mark Zuckerberg and the CEOs of these companies you already allowed one foreign power to interfere in our elections.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:15.000]  You already facilitated one genocide in Myanmar. Do it again and you go to jail.
[1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:22.000]  The ADL then goes further and calls for a purge of everyone who does not agree with them.
[1:24:22.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  They insist on facts and purge these lies and conspiracies from their platforms.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:38.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, not even Hitler gave speeches this evil and this draconian. He just took over and then carried out the evil.
[1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  Multinational corporations working with groups like the ADL have decided to brand any resistance to their takeover as anti-semitic.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  This is so incredibly dangerous and is going to blow up in the face of those that are trying it.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:08.000]  It's the ADL spokesperson that famously said throw the Jew down the well so my country can be free.
[1:25:08.000 --> 1:25:20.000]  They simply say uphold the Bill of Rights and Constitution and stand up to those that want to gag the people of the United States just as the people of Europe and the UK have been silenced.
[1:25:20.000 --> 1:25:29.000]  This is the tyranny in our age. This is the threat. This is the authoritarianism.
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  Do it again and you go to jail.
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  Since when in history have we heard a powerful organization via their celebrity spokesperson say if corporations don't do our exact bidding, we are going to have their directors arrested.
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:54.000]  If what you just heard isn't Hitlerian, nothing is.
[1:25:54.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  It's why YouTube recommended videos by the conspiracist Alex Jones billions of times.
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  It's why fake news outperforms real news because studies show that lies spread faster than truth.
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  And it's no surprise that the greatest propaganda machine in history has spread the oldest conspiracy theory in history.
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  The lie that Jews are somehow dangerous.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:29.000]  So the trick is very, very elementary. Convinced to everyone that there's a second holocaust about to happen and that there are Nazis under every table.
[1:26:29.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  And then switch it to Alex Jones and Donald Trump and nationalists and conservatives.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:44.000]  On the Internet, everything can appear equally legitimate. Breitbart resembles the BBC.
[1:26:44.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  The fictitious protocols of the Elders of Zion look as valid as an ADL report.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  So the ADL is going to protect us from all these Nazis.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  And then we learn there Alex Jones, Donald Trump, Breitbart, Stephen Miller, anybody that doesn't like George Soros, that was an actual Nazi collaborator and said it was the best time of his life on 60 Minutes.
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:06.000]  This is dangerous.
[1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  But it's more than just a power grab. It's also about money because the ADL is already paid hundreds of millions of dollars a year by big tech to run their moderation and the training of their sensors.
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:27.000]  But Cohen says that's not enough. You better spend unlimited amounts of money to stop what they deem as thought crime.
[1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:38.000]  Now in their defense, these social media companies have taken some steps to reduce hate and conspiracies on their platforms. But these steps have been mainly superficial.
[1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  The ADL teleprompter reader insults all of his viewers by claiming that big tech censorship directed and captained by the ADL has only been superficial.
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:57.000]  Hundreds of millions of accounts have been suspended. Anyone promoting Trump or nationalism of the Second Amendment has been banned.
[1:27:57.000 --> 1:28:05.000]  Thousands of people I know have lost their bank accounts at the ADL's direction. What did Hitler do at Nazi Germany in the early years?
[1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  He took Jews bank accounts away and wouldn't let them engage in commerce.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:20.000]  Voltaire was right when he said those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:33.000]  Arrest people that don't submit. Purge the Internet. This is what you hear out of megalomaniacs mouths and the stench of authoritarian danger is absolutely overwhelming.
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:37.000]  This can't possibly be what the creators of the Internet had in mind.
[1:28:37.000 --> 1:28:40.000]  One of the few true things that Cohen said.
[1:28:40.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  There's about five minutes left of it. It has not been uploaded to Band-Aid video yet because we're going to add some more documents where the Nazis did take the Jews banking and commerce away.
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:53.000]  We're going to add that video and documentation to it and we're going to upload it today.
[1:28:53.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  He hopes the ADL hopes you don't see it.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  That's right.
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  Remember when we had llamas?
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:55.000]  This Black Friday, Friday, Friday. Don't have fear of missing out. Go to infowarstore.com and get 50% off free shipping and triple. That's right. Triple Patriot points. Only this Black Friday at infowarstore.com.
[1:29:55.000 --> 1:30:12.000]  Major report out of major university. Researchers working on food based treatment to slow aging science daily. Probiotics in the gut of a particular type cause your entire body to be healthier and make you live longer and make you not get intestinal cancer.
[1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:28.000]  We have the very best formula literally with what they even mentioned in the studies and it explains the hormone called FGF21 pro longevity heals the entire body and actually reverses aging but is only made in the lower intestine.
[1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:34.000]  Oh, and what does it say? It's fiber from a spectrum of certain types of berries that grows this.
[1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:48.000]  Yes, this is a plug. Gut fusion. And what do we have in this? High auric berry blend, strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, cranberry, escoblio, grape and pomegranate. It's the pulp from them that then grows this.
[1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:56.000]  Gut fusion for children, for young people, for old people, for everybody. This is fiber and glutamine. You're not going to find a better formula. Gut fusion. It's amazing.
[1:30:56.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up. I've said it many times, I will never give in. I will never give up, but I could give out.
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:22.000]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity, to see evil running rampant like this and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:38.000]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech. And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about newswars.com, infowars.com and banned.video.
[1:31:38.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever. And that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at infowars.com forward slash show and banned.video.
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  So take heart, folks. They've had to censor everybody and shut everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:32:08.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the infowars, the family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air. And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[1:32:08.000 --> 1:32:23.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres. But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[1:32:23.000 --> 1:32:32.000]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration. The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:42.000]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard. So it's not a burden to support infowars.
[1:32:42.000 --> 1:33:00.000]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better. So visit infowarstore.com today.
[1:33:00.000 --> 1:33:04.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:41.000]  You are receiving this transmission. You are the resistance. We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center. It's Alex Jones.
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Attorney General William Barr says the death of Epstein was a perfect storm.
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:34:02.000]  And now we can just forget about it and stop asking questions. You see the two jail guards fell asleep and that's all that happened. So you need to go back to sleep.
[1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:12.000]  Except they got rid of the regular guards that day and brought in new ones. The lights turned off. The camera failed. Epstein said to his lawyers and family, they're trying to murder me.
[1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:22.000]  They'd already tried to kill him in one jail cell. People around the cell heard him fight for his life and beg for his life. But he was running child kidnapping rings.
[1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  Not just the underage girls for the Clintons, for the deep state, for British intelligence, for the CIA, for Mossad in a huge network.
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  And now the whole house of cards is coming down. And guess what? Come on in here. Here's our producer, Scott. It's a limited edition shirt. Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein.
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:47.000]  They don't hang themselves. Only 2,000 of these have been printed. It's a really nice sweater. Turn around, my friend.
[1:34:47.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  It says infowars.com with the O as a reef noose. A great way to expose the deep state. Exercise your free speech in the face of the globalist and they can't stand it.
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:12.000]  Limited edition funds the info war high quality at infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And right now Black Friday specials, the biggest ever are running for a limited time and free shipping.
[1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:20.000]  And again, I really like this shirt. He was wearing it today. That reminded me that they just came in the 18 Wheeler on Thursday.
[1:35:20.000 --> 1:35:29.000]  This is a limited edition shirt. It funds the info war. Get yours. And it helps educate people about the deep state. It's a great way to start conversations.
[1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:35.000]  The establishment doesn't want you to talk about it. It's bringing down the whole house of cards. So be sure and get yours. A total 360 win.
[1:35:35.000 --> 1:35:41.000]  Plus people are into ugly sweaters. That's kind of the trend right now is how ugly your Christmas sweater. Well, it's a very nice white and green. Nice words.
[1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:51.000]  But I got to agree. That is an ugly mug of Lord Epstein. And so there you go. And of course, the ADL is already said. If you talk about Epstein, it's anti Semitic as well.
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:36:01.000]  Nothing to see here. Nothing going on. Well, I mean, I'm not bringing it up because I'm anti Jewish because you have to be Jewish. I'm anti deep state globalist anti pedophile.
[1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:11.000]  And so I'm sorry, ADL. I know that you got your founding when a man kidnapped and strangled a 13 year old girl that he raped. And so I understand you're really pissed that we're against pedophilia here.
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:17.000]  But we're going to oppose it and we're going to promote free speech and we're going to stand up to for people of all races, colors and creed.
[1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:24.000]  Be they Jewish, be they Muslim, be they Christian, be they agnostic, as long as they support American freedom and you do not speak for Jews.
[1:36:24.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  ADL, you speak for the evil deep state and scum like Epstein and the Clintons and you will be held accountable for your crimes. And America stands with us.
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:44.000]  So there you go. Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein. They don't hang themselves. Get your shirt info or store.com today. Thank you.
[1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:55.000]  I'm really angry about this Epstein situation because I exposed it 13 years ago from my sources and I got demonized and attacked.
[1:36:55.000 --> 1:37:03.000]  And then now they got him. I said they'd murder him. They did. Now they're covering that up. And it's just truly disgusting.
[1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  And I've had high level CIA people on like Steve Pacenek and he'll tell you was mainly British intelligence.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:15.000]  And it's British intelligence is specialty using pedophilia to control people.
[1:37:15.000 --> 1:37:24.000]  And the woman he was dating, her father was the main guy doing that as well between British and Israeli intelligence and it's wrong.
[1:37:24.000 --> 1:37:34.000]  You know, pedophilia is not OK of the Nazis are doing it. Not OK of the Russians are doing it. Not OK of Israel's doing it. I don't care who it is. It's wrong.
[1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:42.000]  I may get demonized by the ADL for that. I'm proud to be. I don't support drag queen story time drag queen pedophile time either.
[1:37:42.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  And so yes, ladies and gentlemen, one hell of a time to be alive. It's definitely getting crazy.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  And you know, the truth is Trump is not anti-Semitic. I'm not anti-Semitic. Jews are a diverse group of people.
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:38:02.000]  But I am anti-communist anti-tire and anti-pedophilia and the ADL was founded to cover up for a pedophile.
[1:38:02.000 --> 1:38:09.000]  And so if the ADL wants to get in the fight with me politically, wants to get in that briar patch, well, they just threw me in that briar patch.
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:15.000]  And I'm very happy to be in that briar patch. And I am sick of the ADL trying to speak for Israel.
[1:38:15.000 --> 1:38:24.000]  And the ADL's job is to create anti-Semitism so Jews get persecuted by idiots and then the ADL collects the money off of them.
[1:38:24.000 --> 1:38:31.000]  And that's the scam and that's how it works. And they cannot stand the fact that I'm giving you the inside baseball on this.
[1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:36.000]  I want unity. I want freedom. I want real justice.
[1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:41.000]  And I know that's what so many people of every race, color and creed want.
[1:38:41.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  And I know that we've got such amazing fans in America and in Europe and in Israel and everywhere else.
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:55.000]  And I just get so much support from listeners in Israel, wherever I support the fact that the leftist communist ADL does not represent Jews.
[1:38:55.000 --> 1:39:02.000]  And it's absolutely doing a disservice to Jews that are discriminated against and targeted by the type of things they're doing.
[1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:06.000]  Claiming I'm anti-Semitic and Stephen Miller is and Michelle Malkin is.
[1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:12.000]  And just this is asinine crap. Absolute crap.
[1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:17.000]  And it doesn't work because it's not true. Unbelievable.
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:24.000]  The ADL came out and said Trump was bad when he was told by the state police in New Jersey that it was leftist Jews attacking synagogues to blame him.
[1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:28.000]  Trump said looks like it's probably being staged. He was right.
[1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:31.000]  Trump was right.
[1:39:31.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  Just like Jesse Smollett got caught staging stuff. All these groups are doing it.
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  And the left can't bring down Trump. So they're trying to bring down all his supporters.
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:44.000]  And Trump's biggest failing is not standing up against the censorship.
[1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:48.000]  And now the ADL saying we want to arrest the big six tech heads if you just joined us.
[1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  And they want total control or they're going to push for that.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  You're like oh well they won't get that. The ADL and the Southern Barbara Law Center with Hillary are the ones that took over the Internet three years ago and did all the censorship.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  Yes they're in control.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:05.000]  And now they've announced the next leg.
[1:40:05.000 --> 1:40:10.000]  And I guess Trump's going to sit there and do nothing this time.
[1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:14.000]  Trump needs to take action. I understand he's in battles. I understand he's surrounded.
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  Joining us, he was on Friday on another subject, but Jacob Ingalls writes for a lot of publications, GatewayPunna.com and others wrote a big story about this today.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:31.000]  Roger Stone jure outs himself as hardcore leftist after trial and before sentencing proves poison jury pool.
[1:40:31.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  We'll get to that in a moment, but just in the short time we have here in this segment.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:41.000]  What do you make of them saying the ADL that if you talk about Fiona Hill being a Soros operative or anti-Semitic.
[1:40:41.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  Stephen Miller's anti-Semitic Nazi they say and the ADL says and the New York Times picked that up.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  And Trump is and I and everybody else says they say she doesn't know Soros even though she heads up as main foundation and she's not a globalist even though she works at theglobalist.com.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:07.000]  I mean the level of this. What the hell are these people doing? What are they up to?
[1:41:07.000 --> 1:41:16.000]  We're getting an audio problem here today, Sunday show baby, but we're going to work on this and find out what's going on on the other side of this quick break.
[1:41:16.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  I wanted to give you an update on Roger Stone who's been gagged as I'm allowed to speak because Fiona Hill she got up and said she doesn't work for Soros and she's not a globalist.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:34.000]  She's a self described globalist and was the on the board and is on the board was most powerful organization, the open society group.
[1:41:34.000 --> 1:41:42.000]  I showed you her own bio earlier. That's like saying Alex Jones.
[1:41:42.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  Are you a talk radio host and I don't know I don't ever talk radio host.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:53.000]  Or Alex Jones. We were told you're from Texas. I'm not from Texas. Of course I am born and raised.
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  And this is just a magnitude of or Alex Jones that watch we're told is stainless steel.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  No, this watch is leather. Well, it looks like stainless steel from here. Well, you're at anti semi.
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:18.000]  And again, I never even knew vitamin that neurotic out of control little pot belly goblin creature was Jewish.
[1:42:18.000 --> 1:42:23.000]  But they said Jones attack vitamin as a liar because he's Jewish. What the hell.
[1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:29.000]  But again, this is how the left does it. They always hide behind some racial or religious stuff.
[1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:32.000]  It's not true. It doesn't work anymore because it's not true.
[1:42:32.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  So see we get that audio fixed and see what's going on with Roger Stone.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:44.000]  But it's all amazing. And I've got some other news I'm going to hit as well about what's unfolding and who's jumping into the presidential race.
[1:42:44.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  And so much more straight ahead in full wars dot com news wars dot com.
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  Tomorrow's news today. The globalists hope you don't share those links. They hope you give up and roll over.
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  Beto Rourke came out dozens of times and said we're going to confiscate all your semi automatic rifles.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  And he got all the other Democrats on the stage nine others to agree and said that he was a hero.
[1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:14.000]  Think about that. Now those Democrats have taken all the guns in the cities they control.
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:23.000]  Their blue cities are literal crap holes covered with needles and with massive drug dealing and incredible levels of violent crime.
[1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  They know what they're doing. And now the Supreme Court's come out and ruled that gun manufacturers can be sued into oblivion for what criminals do using their firearms.
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:37.000]  My goodness, ladies and gentlemen, this country is under such incredible attack.
[1:43:37.000 --> 1:43:46.000]  But more and more towns and cities are saying they're sanctuaries for the Second Amendment and they're going to follow the original Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[1:43:46.000 --> 1:43:49.000]  And they're not going to help in the confiscation of guns.
[1:43:49.000 --> 1:43:58.000]  So you see a lot of these cities ignore illegal aliens. Well, we can ignore all your unconstitutional laws.
[1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:09.000]  A question was once posed to Thomas Jefferson. What is the level of tyranny that a tyrant will take humanity to?
[1:44:09.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  How far will they go? What's their limit? And he said it is the limit to which other men and women will submit.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:24.000]  The answer is there is no limit to evil. It is a bottomless pit.
[1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:33.000]  We've been taught in modern culture and society that evil doesn't exist or that there's no free will. There's no devil or the God.
[1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  But those very same people have all these rules for us about speech and how we can dress and where we can live and what our houses can be like.
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:47.000]  They just don't want us to have any values so they can run over us.
[1:44:47.000 --> 1:44:57.000]  Oxford's band clapping. Universities in the U.S. have banned 21 Gun Salutes for veterans. These people are dangerous cult leaders and it's time to reject them.
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:08.000]  I spend a lot of time reminding the Info Wars family of listeners and viewers that without you we won't be on the air and I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:23.000]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:28.000]  You've got that pledge from me but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:38.000]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there and you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[1:45:38.000 --> 1:45:53.000]  So it's not a burden to support Info Wars. It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.

[1:46:59.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:27.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  Here's the crazy political climate we're in. Just a snapshot of some of the news on my desk.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  New York Times names FBI resistance lawyer under criminal investigation for fabricating Pfizer docs.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:54.000]  It admits that he just took investigations that were illegal that were already launched against Trump's campaign and then just filled in fake info under the 302s, under the reports.
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:48:01.000]  And you look at a photo of this guy, just another slimy looking jerk liberal meatball.
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  You think of the G-Men as all square jawed and all American, yeah, all American Antifa.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  Giuliani says Biden docs to be released if he disappears.
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:18.000]  Says they want to kill him because he's about to bring down the deep state with billions they stole out of Ukraine, which is true.
[1:48:18.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  So now the president's lawyer is talking about being killed and disappeared by a globalist mafia.
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  Bannon says, and I agree with him, that the impeachment is totally blown up the Democrats face.
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:34.000]  That'll only make them double down more, though, because Ruth Bader Ginsburg is in and out of the hospital.
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  She had pancreatic cancer for almost a year. Almost no one lives past that.
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  I mean, despite the best doctors, she's in the hospital every week now.
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:48.000]  Bloomberg announces no news coverage, no negative, no investigative, to be clear.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  Bloomberg news announces no investigation reporting on Michael Bloomberg.
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:58.000]  So they say to be fair, then, no investigative reporting on any candidate.
[1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  Wow, talk about universal corruption.
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  Soros Link, dark money, group funding, ads urging vulnerable Republicans to impeach Trump.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  Told you that was going on.
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  Clinton says that Trump's impeachable needs to be removed. He's committed crimes. That's hilarious.
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:17.000]  Absolutely out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:49:17.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  Trump's doing some of what he said.
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:22.000]  Trump admit expanding Remain in Mexico program.
[1:49:22.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  Migrant protection protocols otherwise referred to as Remain in Mexico will be implemented at additional hot spots along the southern border.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  The program will be rolled into Tucson, Del Rio sectors, which have seen an increase in legal crossings in human trafficking in other sectors.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:41.000]  Migrants will have interviews to determine if they would be a risk in Mexico.
[1:49:41.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  And if not, they'll be sent to Juarez to await their U.S. immigration court hearings instead of inside the U.S.
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:50:01.000]  Europe Wars dot com migrant mob attacks trucker with machetes and spears. Government covers it up.
[1:50:01.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  Antibiotics increase risk of Parkinson's disease. Poison the neurons in the brain. University of Helsinki.
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:12.000]  And it goes on from there.
[1:50:12.000 --> 1:50:16.000]  Yeah, big study came out last week. I probably should have made an even bigger deal about it.
[1:50:16.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  Actually have it here in my stack.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  That whinings in plastics aren't just feminizing men.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:28.000]  They're causing babies to be prematurely born or died.
[1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:38.000]  Because the hormones make the woman during the third trimester go into labor because they mimic hormones that are supposed to trigger giving birth.
[1:50:38.000 --> 1:50:43.000]  There it is exposure to plastics may increase risk of pregnancy loss.
[1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:48.000]  But again, he had a TV show and a movie attacking me.
[1:50:48.000 --> 1:50:59.000]  Sasha Baron Cohen saying I'm insane because I warned of plastics and all the other big comics shows this because there's an agenda to keep you from knowing about this.
[1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:06.000]  By the way, it was the Nazis put fluoride in the water to make people docile and controllable. That's in the Nuremberg trials.
[1:51:06.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  Remember, it's added to your water by the deep state.
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  And Trump needs to get control of the government and remove these groups.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:16.000]  That's why this is so big and why they're so scared of Trump because he really is the president.
[1:51:16.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  And Bill Gates met with him to lie to him and say vaccines don't have any problems.
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:27.000]  Total lie. Read the inserts. He lied to him about 5G too. He bragged about it.
[1:51:27.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  And now Michael Bloomberg, a total globalist that wants to control what you can eat, what you can do, wants to ban soft drinks.
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  How about deadly vaccines with cancer viruses in them, Bloomberg?
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  That's how these leftist globalists always do it. They're poison in the hell out of us and they'll give us some distractionary thing they say is supposedly going to take care of us.
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:55.000]  But continuing with the craziness, in Virginia and elsewhere, gun supporters prepared to defy new laws.
[1:51:55.000 --> 1:52:05.000]  Families, church groups and hunt clubs and neighbors began arriving two hours early with hundreds spilling out in the little courthouse down the hill, the street.
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:15.000]  That's where, here to demand that the Board of Supervisors declare Amelia County a second amendment sanctuary where officials will refuse to enforce any new restrictions on ownership.
[1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  Democrats are now in control so they're going to ban all semi-autos and confiscate them.
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  And the sheriffs all over the state are saying we're not going to do it because it's unconstitutional.
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  And if Supreme Court won't stand up, well, then the people are going to have to take it into their own hands.
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  We're back to 1776 again. This is such a big deal.
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:42.000]  You know, all these towns are ignoring the constitutional federal law that illegal aliens committing crimes are deported.
[1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  But when citizens say you're not going to take my guns because some state law has passed, it clearly is superseded by the Supreme Court, by the law of the land, by common sense.
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:57.000]  Oh, you're a criminal. Special federal task forces are going to come get us.
[1:52:57.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  Well, it's conservatives and Christians and nationalists that built this country.
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  And we're going to defend ourselves. We're not going to crawl in the ditch and let the leftist armists snap their way with us.
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:17.000]  There's a scary article, though, up on infowords.com, out of Oklahoma, where they've been implementing these liberal laws that Trump's been pushing to let criminals out of jail.
[1:53:17.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  And the crime rate is exploding. That's because they're letting people with violent backgrounds out.
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  I am for nonviolent offenders, people with marijuana convictions, things like that out of prison.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  But all Republicans state of Oklahoma passed some of the strongest laws to let hardened criminals out.
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  It's crime surges in Oklahoma.
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:40.000]  Republicans continue to open their prisons.
[1:53:40.000 --> 1:53:47.000]  Conservative review. Who needs George Soros when you have Republicans carrying out his agenda of de-incarceration?
[1:53:47.000 --> 1:53:58.000]  Very, very dangerous. Speaking of dangerous, Antifa attacker arrested a year after his attack on car as the elderly man drove through intersection.
[1:53:58.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  They blocked his car. They beat it with metal batons. He drove away in fear, got up to look at his car.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  They chased him hundreds of yards down, began attacking him and beating the car again.
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:12.000]  And the local papers said he deserved it.
[1:54:12.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  Well, now one of the people attacking the vehicle has been arrested and you look at the slimer.
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  He was indicted 10 months later. They finally arrested him. He is a bouncer.
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:31.000]  And that's his job. And he has a stun gun and his brass knuckles.
[1:54:31.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  Do a document cam. I don't want to show this individual.
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  These are the type of folks wearing masks that just block random roads and then beat old people's vehicles with batons.
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:50.000]  You know, you block my car and start beating them with batons and you jerk my door open.
[1:54:50.000 --> 1:54:55.000]  You just brought a baton to a gunfight. You're trying to kill me with a deadly weapon?
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  I'm going to defend myself. And the system doesn't like this.
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  The communists want to have their way with you and your family and they just can't stand the fact that the crime rate is so low in rural and conservative areas
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  and they want full control and they want to turn every city into hell holes just like they have done with the areas that they are dominant in.
[1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  Speaking of that, Masterpiece Cake Shop faces yet another legal fight over cakes. Little Bitty, husband and wife, Bakery, the leftist,
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:36.000]  went in there and said, you know, beg a cake with two guys on it or whatever, kissing.
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  They said, no, we're not doing it for religious reasons.
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  They wanted the Supreme Court will now a transgendered excessive man address that takes hormones has come in and started a whole new lawsuit against them.
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  So there you go. The left never gives up. And that's why they're shooting us.
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:59.000]  George Soros is financing lawsuits against us. We've beaten most of them. You see all the fake news out there.
[1:55:59.000 --> 1:56:10.000]  But regardless, they want to shut our money off, shut down in force, this great infrastructure we've built, get us off air so then they can really set me up with criminal charges.
[1:56:10.000 --> 1:56:16.000]  That's their program. First they silence you, then they set you up and they put you in prison. That's their main goal.
[1:56:16.000 --> 1:56:18.000]  But we've stayed on air. We're still here. Thanks to you.
[1:56:18.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  And we are fighting the globalist. We are fighting Soros. We are fighting Hillary.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:31.000]  We are fighting the Southern primary law center, the ADL and all these really dangerous groups of mafias that are trying to bully America into submission.
[1:56:31.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  And the bullying has gone too long and others need to stand up.
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  But the biggest way you can stand against this evil and be just as important and as informative and powerful as in force has been is continue to spread the word, continue to buy the products, continue to pray for us.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  Because when you do that, you aren't just standing with us. You are us.
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  So thanks for keeping us in the fight. But let me tell you, this is a life and death situation.
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  So we had the biggest sales ever last Christmas. And this year we're making, we had the Black Friday comes early.
