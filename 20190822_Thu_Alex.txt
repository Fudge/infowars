[00:00.000 --> 00:00.100]  There are
[00:00.100 --> 00:12.840]  Here we are on this channel.
[00:12.840 --> 00:38.900]  What are you making?
[00:38.900 --> 00:52.060]  So, the fake news of which many of you are members is trying to convince the public to
[00:52.060 --> 00:53.060]  have a recession.
[00:53.060 --> 00:54.560]  Let's have a recession.
[00:54.560 --> 00:59.980]  The United States is doing phenomenally well, but one thing I have to do is economically
[00:59.980 --> 01:05.420]  take on China, because China has been ripping us off for many years.
[01:05.420 --> 01:10.220]  And Clinton, President Bush, and President Obama, and others should have done this long
[01:10.220 --> 01:11.820]  before me.
[01:11.820 --> 01:17.260]  My life would be much easier, although I enjoy doing it, but my life would be much easier
[01:17.260 --> 01:22.020]  if I just said, let China continue to rip off the United States, all right?
[01:22.020 --> 01:24.700]  It would be much easier, but I can't do that.
[01:24.700 --> 01:26.740]  We are winning against China.
[01:26.740 --> 01:30.500]  They've lost two and a half million jobs in a very short period of time.
[01:30.500 --> 01:31.500]  They want to make a deal.
[01:31.500 --> 01:36.940]  It's got to be a deal that's good for the United States, where they want to make a deal.
[01:36.940 --> 01:38.700]  Probably we will make a deal.
[01:38.700 --> 01:43.020]  But if I didn't do that, and I'm not doing it, somebody said it's Trump's trade war.
[01:43.020 --> 01:44.820]  This isn't my trade war.
[01:44.820 --> 01:51.180]  This is a trade war that should have taken place a long time ago by a lot of other presidents.
[01:51.180 --> 01:59.620]  Over the last five or six years, China has made $500 billion, $500 billion, ripped it
[01:59.620 --> 02:01.420]  out of the United States.
[02:01.420 --> 02:07.740]  And not only that, if you take a look, intellectual property theft, add that to it.
[02:07.740 --> 02:09.540]  And they add a lot of other things to it.
[02:09.540 --> 02:13.500]  So somebody, excuse me, somebody had to do it.
[02:13.500 --> 02:15.780]  I am the chosen one.
[02:15.780 --> 02:16.900]  Somebody had to do it.
[02:16.900 --> 02:18.540]  So I'm taking on China.
[02:18.540 --> 02:20.940]  I'm taking on China on trade.
[02:20.940 --> 02:21.940]  And you know what?
[02:21.940 --> 02:24.180]  We're winning because we're the piggy bank.
[02:24.180 --> 02:30.260]  We're the one that all these countries, including the European Union, wants to rob and takes
[02:30.260 --> 02:31.260]  advantage of.
[02:31.260 --> 02:37.820]  The European Union, $200 billion, China, more than $500 billion, sorry.
[02:37.820 --> 02:44.860]  I was put here, I was put here by people, I was put here by people to do a great job.
[02:44.860 --> 02:45.860]  And that's what I'm doing.
[02:45.860 --> 02:48.020]  And nobody's done a job like I've done.
[02:48.020 --> 02:54.180]  Now, would China rather wait for a little more than a year and try and get sleepy Joe
[02:54.180 --> 02:58.860]  Biden to negotiate with instead of President Trump?
[02:58.860 --> 02:59.860]  Maybe.
[02:59.860 --> 03:00.860]  But I don't think so.
[03:00.860 --> 03:01.860]  You know why?
[03:01.860 --> 03:03.940]  They're losing too many jobs too fast.
[03:03.940 --> 03:06.660]  They had the worst year in 27 years.
[03:06.660 --> 03:09.540]  But I think it was actually 52 or 54 years.
[03:09.540 --> 03:13.580]  It's the worst year they've had in a half a century.
[03:13.580 --> 03:14.780]  And that's because of me.
[03:14.780 --> 03:16.500]  And I'm not proud of that.
[03:16.500 --> 03:17.500]  But you know what?
[03:17.500 --> 03:18.500]  They want to negotiate.
[03:18.500 --> 03:20.900]  And sleepy Joe doesn't have a clue.
[03:20.900 --> 03:22.740]  Sleepy Joe said, oh, China's wonderful.
[03:22.740 --> 03:26.500]  Well, China is wonderful for China.
[03:26.500 --> 03:31.300]  But I'm wonderful for the USA.
[03:31.300 --> 03:33.420]  Trump is our champion.
[03:33.420 --> 03:34.420]  Trump is delivering.
[03:34.420 --> 03:37.420]  And what you just heard is the truth.
[03:37.420 --> 03:42.740]  It's so refreshing to hear a statesman in office telling it like it is and straight
[03:42.740 --> 03:43.740]  shooting.
[03:43.740 --> 03:47.820]  73 years old.
[03:47.820 --> 03:49.300]  Never seen anything like it.
[03:49.300 --> 03:50.300]  The precision.
[03:50.300 --> 03:51.300]  The commitment.
[03:51.300 --> 03:54.460]  Yes, Trump is the chosen one.
[03:54.460 --> 03:59.060]  We're all chosen to fulfill our destinies if we choose to take those destinies in our
[03:59.060 --> 04:00.060]  hands.
[04:00.060 --> 04:04.500]  And Trump is delivering the country out of the globalist bondage.
[04:04.500 --> 04:11.860]  And they're fighting like the devil to keep their entire system in place right now.
[04:11.860 --> 04:13.460]  And this country is in a fight.
[04:13.460 --> 04:19.420]  And you just heard Trump with China that is trying to keep the Democrats in power and
[04:19.420 --> 04:25.540]  openly is their main financier through U.S.-based Chinese companies.
[04:25.540 --> 04:30.820]  And I can tell you, it's being looked at as an actual security issue.
[04:30.820 --> 04:36.620]  And more and more, it's being realized that the globalists sold the country out to China,
[04:36.620 --> 04:39.220]  not just economically, but politically and culturally.
[04:39.220 --> 04:41.580]  And that this is treason.
[04:41.580 --> 04:47.300]  That's exactly what his mission is, is to turn that around.
[04:47.300 --> 04:49.980]  It's your mission, it's my mission, and you choose to accept it.
[04:49.980 --> 04:53.980]  You'll be back more on the other side of the Information War.
[04:53.980 --> 05:00.820]  And all of you have chosen to tune into this broadcast, it's for the word.

[06:14.820 --> 06:17.500]  It's Alex Jones.
[06:17.500 --> 06:19.020]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[06:19.020 --> 06:21.820]  Thank you so much for allowing this broadcast to even exist.
[06:21.820 --> 06:24.180]  You are the wind in our sails.
[06:24.180 --> 06:34.180]  We're all on this ship together called Planet Earth, here in Deep Space.
[06:34.180 --> 06:37.260]  It's Thursday, August 22, 2019.
[06:37.260 --> 06:40.260]  I intend to open the phones up again today and take a lot of calls.
[06:40.260 --> 06:46.300]  We do a pretty good job at that, and I intend to have several special guests here in studio
[06:46.300 --> 06:49.660]  as well, and some that will be over Skype from Europe.
[06:49.660 --> 06:54.700]  We also have our reporters filing a whole bunch of amazing videos that we're going to
[06:54.700 --> 06:59.980]  be posting them, FullWars.com, and playing some today from Hong Kong, which really is
[06:59.980 --> 07:06.300]  the epicenter of the Chai-Kong attempt to invade into the South China Sea and take islands
[07:06.300 --> 07:11.660]  from the Philippines, Japan, you name it, and it is a military flashpoint that the
[07:11.660 --> 07:18.620]  Chinese are threatening to invade as early as this next week, and so our reporters are
[07:18.620 --> 07:23.260]  there on the ground, and I will just also let you know that we're going to have some
[07:23.260 --> 07:28.860]  other special guests from Hong Kong coming up next week, but I'm not going to announce
[07:28.860 --> 07:37.620]  who those people are going to be until they are in country, so let's just stop right there.
[07:37.620 --> 07:39.980]  You know, I come in here and I look at all this news, and I've got all this research
[07:39.980 --> 07:45.140]  and all these clips, and I try to sit back and ask myself, what really is the biggest
[07:45.140 --> 07:50.940]  story of our age and that's unfolding right now, and it's undoubtedly the global awakening,
[07:50.940 --> 07:57.260]  and that people are not buying what the government is saying anymore, or buying what corporations
[07:57.260 --> 08:01.980]  are saying anymore, but they're going past that, they're actually going out and researching
[08:01.980 --> 08:07.500]  and finding out for themselves, and all the attempts of Google and all the attempts of
[08:07.500 --> 08:12.900]  Facebook and the technocrats to suppress this are going to fail one way or another,
[08:12.900 --> 08:19.660]  and they are failing, in fact, all the censorship has only made people that much more apprehensive
[08:19.660 --> 08:26.060]  about mainstream news, and so when you get attacked by it, it has a buoying effect to
[08:26.060 --> 08:27.060]  a great extent.
[08:27.060 --> 08:32.420]  Now, there are zombie-like hordes out there that come in every shape, color, and size
[08:32.420 --> 08:42.220]  of our fellow humans who are believing the propaganda and have gone into just apoplexy.
[08:42.220 --> 08:47.460]  They are just completely beside themselves and getting more and more radical by the
[08:47.460 --> 08:55.780]  minute, and so to a certain extent, the globalist venom is working, but it's only working in
[08:55.780 --> 09:02.140]  the most low IQ, weak-minded people, or those that are manipulating those people and feeding
[09:02.140 --> 09:07.620]  off of them, and I have a spectrum of these reports here.
[09:07.620 --> 09:13.260]  You can't turn on a television or open a newspaper or go online, whether you've got a droid or
[09:13.260 --> 09:18.420]  an iPhone, it's just apples force-feeding you, oh, Obama's Harvard professor says Trump's
[09:18.420 --> 09:19.420]  a racist.
[09:19.420 --> 09:24.900]  Boy, that's original, or this politician's senator, this movie star, who cares?
[09:24.900 --> 09:29.700]  It's so obvious, the movies, the culture is trying to start a race war, and then you get
[09:29.700 --> 09:35.980]  the internal transcript last week out of the New York Times, and they're saying, we're
[09:35.980 --> 09:42.620]  going to pivot from Russia, that's flat-footed, that's not true, we're going to go to race.
[09:42.620 --> 09:47.340]  But then the head of the New York Times says, but you've got to be nuanced, okay, you can't
[09:47.340 --> 09:53.060]  just call them a Nazi or racist, you've got to find something and then build off of that,
[09:53.060 --> 10:00.940]  and so Trump says, man, these Jews sure are betraying Israel, working with people like
[10:00.940 --> 10:04.700]  Tlaib and everybody that literally want to blow it off the face of the earth, and they
[10:04.700 --> 10:13.380]  turn that around to, did you hear the anti-Semitic statement, so support for Israel and its existence
[10:13.380 --> 10:18.620]  is now anti-Semitic, this is upside-down world, and you've got the extreme right and
[10:18.620 --> 10:25.740]  extreme left that are really the same people obsessing over Israel constantly and applying
[10:25.740 --> 10:31.940]  mythical leprechaun powers to Israel and then acting like Netanyahu runs the world, meanwhile
[10:31.940 --> 10:39.060]  it's the Rothschilds who are globalist leftists, Jews, who are now trying to overthrow Netanyahu.
[10:39.060 --> 10:47.380]  I mean, you cannot make this up, but then all the moron Nazis and all the moron leftists
[10:47.380 --> 10:52.380]  get mad at me because I support the existence of Israel.
[10:52.380 --> 10:55.980]  Israel has hundreds of nuclear weapons, it's not going anywhere, Israel's the most stable
[10:55.980 --> 10:59.740]  place in the Middle East, Israel has more human rights than all those countries, Saudi
[10:59.740 --> 11:06.220]  Arabia doesn't take one Palestinian in or one refugee, and I'm sick of it and the same
[11:06.220 --> 11:09.580]  playbook been running against Israel about, open your borders, let everybody in to have
[11:09.580 --> 11:14.700]  free stuff, it's been running against us, you're not shat there in the break room, what was
[11:14.700 --> 11:19.820]  it Monday evening and with my mouth hanging open during that press conference with the
[11:19.820 --> 11:28.020]  four horsemen of the Democratic apocalypse, crying and whining and oh, my mother needed
[11:28.020 --> 11:35.060]  to hospital, she was in Palestine or my grandmother and they wouldn't let her in for free healthcare.
[11:35.060 --> 11:42.260]  So you want to blow the country up and then, but it's got to give you some free stuff,
[11:42.260 --> 11:47.500]  but then in your wonderful Palestinian place, you can't even put two and two together and
[11:47.500 --> 11:53.820]  you basically live in a dictatorship and then Saudi Arabia won't take one of you in
[11:53.820 --> 12:00.460]  Jordan won't take you in and Egypt won't take you in and why is that? Because every time
[12:00.460 --> 12:04.500]  you look at who's starting these rebellions and these attacks, it's Palestinians because
[12:04.500 --> 12:09.300]  they don't even exist folks, they're just people that migrated into that area and want
[12:09.300 --> 12:16.140]  to take it over, it's a made up thing and so everybody's tried to bully me to attack
[12:16.140 --> 12:21.860]  Israel and tried to bully me, no I'm going to support Israel now more because you tell
[12:21.860 --> 12:26.940]  me I can't, it's sick and of course Israel has all its own corruption, all its own problems
[12:26.940 --> 12:30.740]  has staged false flags against us, working with the US government and has had lots of
[12:30.740 --> 12:35.940]  problems, so is our government, so is the Italian government, so is the Russian government.
[12:35.940 --> 12:41.660]  But fetishizing attacking Israel and hating it, people go well, they're never going to
[12:41.660 --> 12:46.220]  be able to convince her that America is racist and apartheid and have a race war, well really,
[12:46.220 --> 12:52.660]  they're successfully doing it with the left, the average leftist hates Israel, it's a litmus
[12:52.660 --> 13:00.140]  test, are you for killing babies, are you for sterilizing young kids, the whole trans
[13:00.140 --> 13:07.180]  agenda and do you hate Israel? I've never been to Israel and I've got all these stuff
[13:07.180 --> 13:10.260]  you should get into but I've got a lot of news out of Israel but I just think about
[13:10.260 --> 13:13.380]  to leave talking about her grandmother, I never got to the clip, we're going to play
[13:13.380 --> 13:20.260]  it later and she's crying and it's so fake and Israel is just a way to see this picture,
[13:20.260 --> 13:24.300]  a rosetta stone, a skeleton key as I call it, because it's the left, their religion
[13:24.300 --> 13:28.860]  is that they're victims, it's like all these people that attempt suicide constantly for
[13:28.860 --> 13:33.060]  attention, it's one thing you've got bone cancer and you're in incredible pain, you
[13:33.060 --> 13:36.620]  don't want to spend all your money, all your family's money on it and don't want to go
[13:36.620 --> 13:39.700]  through all the pain, you shove a gun in your mouth and blow your head off, hey, that's
[13:39.700 --> 13:45.940]  your life, I don't judge you, I understand that but all these people that constantly
[13:45.940 --> 13:50.220]  are attempting suicide and constantly whining about what victims they are and I look at
[13:50.220 --> 13:56.220]  the four horsemen, these parasites that hate America and tell us how bad we are all day
[13:56.220 --> 14:01.820]  and then fetishize saying Israel shouldn't exist and then when Israel doesn't let her
[14:01.820 --> 14:07.420]  in, she whines and cries about her grandmother and how her grandmother deserves all this
[14:07.420 --> 14:14.300]  free healthcare that she thinks is in Israel and again Israel is just a microcosm of all
[14:14.300 --> 14:20.620]  of this and the point is there's a fight over who controls Israel, there's a fight over
[14:20.620 --> 14:25.060]  who controls America, there's a fight over who controls Europe and it's not a fight
[14:25.060 --> 14:32.060]  between Germans and Jews or between Mexicans and Russians or between Chinese and Japanese,
[14:32.060 --> 14:38.460]  it's a fight between evil and good, in your family it's a fight between good and evil
[14:38.460 --> 14:42.500]  and your relationships, in your business, in your life, at your church, there's a struggle
[14:42.500 --> 14:47.820]  in the universe between good and evil and there are ideologies that are evil, there
[14:47.820 --> 14:51.940]  are systems that are evil, there are groups and gangs and organizations that are evil
[14:51.940 --> 14:57.220]  and they take countries over just like Hitler took over Germany or Stalin and Lenin took
[14:57.220 --> 15:01.620]  over Russia and when you get evil in charge of a group of people you got a problem and
[15:01.620 --> 15:08.660]  Israel's had plenty of evil people that have ran it but again it goes back to a fight between
[15:08.660 --> 15:13.460]  good and evil and real evil is about to get turned loose on the planet, the devil's making
[15:13.460 --> 15:20.260]  his move and everybody better decide which side you're on and the cop-outs, the cop-outs
[15:20.260 --> 15:25.580]  here, you know you don't seem to be trying to get to Somalia for the free healthcare
[15:25.580 --> 15:29.860]  where women are still sold as sex slaves, I mean the four horsemen are in the news,
[15:29.860 --> 15:38.660]  they won't see a word about more Muslim countries passing laws like the West Bank, like the

[18:58.420 --> 19:04.420]  Thomas Jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble
[19:04.420 --> 19:08.820]  in the future, it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground, close to reality, who
[19:08.820 --> 19:12.620]  actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation and today the communist
[19:12.620 --> 19:18.300]  Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases
[19:18.300 --> 19:23.380]  in polls to support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war, once China
[19:23.380 --> 19:28.260]  put pressure on our farmers, that's beautiful, Americans aren't going to be bullied and we
[19:28.260 --> 19:33.100]  aren't going to back down, so to the walking cruises and the Hillary Clinton's the world
[19:33.100 --> 19:37.260]  that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down, we're never going to give up
[19:37.260 --> 19:42.460]  and all you've done is awaken the human spirit and the human spirit lives at infowars.com
[19:42.460 --> 19:47.820]  and newsworks.com and I'm asking listeners, whatever you do, spread those links because

[20:17.820 --> 20:35.260]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host on this Thursday, global edition of the transmission.
[20:35.260 --> 20:38.700]  I didn't mean to go off on a jag about Israel, it's just that I meant to cover that on Monday
[20:38.700 --> 20:46.900]  and Tuesday with the Four Horsemen's parade and now they're back in the news and not telling
[20:46.900 --> 20:51.900]  folks that in the West Bank they kill you if you're a homosexual, but liberal gays don't
[20:51.900 --> 20:55.140]  care about that, they just don't want to be called homosexuals.
[20:55.140 --> 20:56.140]  See how it works?
[20:56.140 --> 21:01.300]  Again, it's like apocalypse now, we drop napalm on women and children but the brass won't
[21:01.300 --> 21:06.020]  let us write cuss words on the side of the airplane, it's the same thing, it's like use
[21:06.020 --> 21:13.060]  the words I say but kill me if you're a Muslim, that's a good, bring in the Muslims but call
[21:13.060 --> 21:18.860]  me a homosexual, you've not used the proper word I tell you to use and it's the alliance
[21:18.860 --> 21:25.580]  of the left with the most radical orthodox forms of Islam and then they lecture us how
[21:25.580 --> 21:31.220]  we're oppressive and homophobic and all this and I'm just done, it's all a hoax, it's all
[21:31.220 --> 21:38.700]  a lie and I know everybody knows that but they've cut us out of the infrastructure of
[21:38.700 --> 21:44.020]  information so that whether you're Alex Jones or you're just Sally soccer mom that's conservative
[21:44.020 --> 21:48.060]  or nationalist, you're being silenced, you're being curtailed, they admit they're doing
[21:48.060 --> 21:55.780]  it and it's real authoritarianism and then I see Trump up there, we just played two and
[21:55.780 --> 21:58.500]  a half minutes up at the start of the show, I'm gonna play a short clip of it again right
[21:58.500 --> 22:03.140]  now and then even more of the press conference later because it's just he's getting better
[22:03.140 --> 22:08.980]  and better, I'm sorry and I told you he wasn't gonna do the expanded background checks, I
[22:08.980 --> 22:12.780]  told you that was meant to take the wind out of their sails and shut them down and now
[22:12.780 --> 22:17.820]  that's been shelved and it doesn't mean Trump's perfect but my lord do they hate the fact
[22:17.820 --> 22:21.860]  he's in there and he's stabilizing and trying to build the economy and they are trying to
[22:21.860 --> 22:27.900]  wreck it all right now, this country is at war with a globalist system and Trump just
[22:27.900 --> 22:35.860]  said in the press conference this morning and yesterday that we are at war with China,
[22:35.860 --> 22:41.740]  we've been at war for 30 plus years, they've been kicking the living stock out of us, he
[22:41.740 --> 22:47.860]  said they pull 500 billion out, he said over the years, that's the one thing he said that
[22:47.860 --> 22:59.780]  made his statement 99% accurate, it's 900 billion a year, 500 billion trade deficit,
[22:59.780 --> 23:06.060]  another 400 billion estimated in stolen intellectual property, everybody knows that and it's all
[23:06.060 --> 23:11.820]  one sided and it's not fair and you don't hear a word out of the left again about China
[23:11.820 --> 23:18.220]  that makes Hitler look like an amateur, I'm just seeing my reporters right there at the
[23:18.220 --> 23:22.300]  edge of the bridge and across it is communist China and hundreds of thousands of troops
[23:22.300 --> 23:28.420]  and massing military and it just gives me butterflies to think we're that close to war
[23:28.420 --> 23:35.540]  with these monsters and the Washington Post and others have big headlines and articles
[23:35.540 --> 23:43.340]  about how G is going to destroy Trump to save America, that's sick and then the left
[23:43.340 --> 23:52.820]  now in their own publications and on the street are champion Z, that's how much they
[23:52.820 --> 23:59.580]  hate America folks and it makes me really sad to know that a third of our population
[23:59.580 --> 24:05.900]  has been totally brainwashed to hate their own country, they have no idea how savage
[24:05.900 --> 24:10.420]  China is, how evil it is, if somebody's old they just leave them on the side of the street
[24:10.420 --> 24:17.700]  to die in many areas, if somebody gets hurt nobody helps them, it's savage, Taiwan's
[24:17.700 --> 24:21.860]  not like that, Hong Kong's not like that and they're Chinese because they're the people
[24:21.860 --> 24:31.660]  that fled Mao and they were under British rule that compared to the Chi Coms was heavenly
[24:31.660 --> 24:35.220]  and the people are alive and vibrant and cool, I mean you meet people from Hong Kong and
[24:35.220 --> 24:41.940]  Taiwan it's like a totally different brand of person, exceptional compared to what you
[24:41.940 --> 24:47.380]  get under the communist system from just two generations, they have mobile execution vans
[24:47.380 --> 24:54.940]  in every city where you don't even go to a jail cell, they just cut your organs out
[24:54.940 --> 24:59.620]  and they've been human cloning for 30 years, it's in the medical journals now it's all
[24:59.620 --> 25:05.900]  out just as I told you growing humans inside cows because you can grow up a bigger humanoid
[25:05.900 --> 25:15.100]  that's got the organs and just like the movie The Island they put all this out in the open
[25:15.100 --> 25:18.900]  they found you they try to grow organs by themselves they don't thrive it's got to have
[25:18.900 --> 25:25.740]  a brain a nervous system attached to it, so they're growing whole humans and doing it
[25:25.740 --> 25:30.740]  a while a lot of the organs coming out of China are cloners and this is all coming out
[25:30.740 --> 25:36.260]  and the Albert Einstein Institute and the Rockefellers and Epstein that ran it are obsessed with
[25:36.260 --> 25:43.940]  underground cloning programs and underground vaccine programs, look it up, we're not in
[25:43.940 --> 25:51.020]  Kansas folks I know I say that a lot we're not in Kansas anymore okay and there's a race
[25:51.020 --> 25:58.660]  to surveil a race to control a race to censor and a race to just absolutely wipe out the
[25:58.660 --> 26:08.620]  human community teaches that the word mother and father is bad, RNC ads that say we're
[26:08.620 --> 26:14.140]  looking for strong women are banned because they say it's hateful you're like that's insane
[26:14.140 --> 26:20.740]  exactly but you see it's here Alex Jones last year RNC now and Mitch McConnell and
[26:20.740 --> 26:27.180]  all them even though he's censored they still can't find their wave o's for their own children's
[26:27.180 --> 26:32.980]  future and are still not acting, Trump's acting on China because it's the main system that
[26:32.980 --> 26:37.660]  the globalist parlayed our power into and they're then using it to suck the energy out
[26:37.660 --> 26:42.860]  of the US for their world government and I know I harp on this because you notice the
[26:42.860 --> 26:47.340]  president's listening the culture's listening what's left the Pentagon's listening and we
[26:47.340 --> 26:52.460]  don't recognize just how overrun we are and how almost completely captured we were and
[26:52.460 --> 26:56.860]  how we're fighting for our lives with our valiant president and everything we wanted
[26:56.860 --> 27:02.060]  happening and globalism beginning to get on the retreat on its heels we're rallying
[27:02.060 --> 27:11.780]  back bloodied shot full of holes but we have the spirit of victory and Trump says in his
[27:11.780 --> 27:17.420]  whole talk I'm the chosen one I got elected he looks up and I'm it's true I mean obviously
[27:17.420 --> 27:20.660]  we're all chosen for what we do if we take the path God gives us a path the devil gives
[27:20.660 --> 27:28.140]  us another of course Trump's chosen it's a phenomenon and everybody can see it and smell
[27:28.140 --> 27:33.660]  it and the devil and the enemies the little snakes they can't stand it let's go out to
[27:33.660 --> 27:38.100]  break with the president talking about being the chosen one and acknowledging God that
[27:38.100 --> 27:45.420]  God chose to put him in that position against the enemy's whole operation that is God China's
[27:45.420 --> 27:53.020]  made five hundred billion dollars five hundred billion ripped it out of the United States
[27:53.020 --> 27:59.860]  and not only that if you take a look intellectual property theft add that to it and add a lot
[27:59.860 --> 28:07.020]  of other things to it so somebody excuse me somebody had to do it I am the chosen one
[28:07.020 --> 28:11.020]  somebody had to do it and then he goes on to say I was chosen by the American people
[28:11.020 --> 28:16.580]  to do this but he also acknowledged God it's that connection the people to the leader to
[28:16.580 --> 28:23.100]  God you get evil leaders they work for the prince of the air the prince and principalities
[28:23.100 --> 28:28.860]  evil and high places if somebody's put in there because of the prayers and people taking
[28:28.860 --> 28:34.380]  action then it's chosen by God but here's the thing it's our last chance the clonings
[28:34.380 --> 28:40.140]  going on the abortion the killing of the babies that keep him alive talking to a nurse about
[28:40.140 --> 28:47.900]  this is true I know I never thought you don't want to be involved in murder do you see how

[31:10.380 --> 31:15.100]  that would end up saving the nation and today the communist Chinese have banned all us farming

[34:48.300 --> 34:56.260]  chosen one to do this task and the profits not known in their own country but trump is
[34:56.260 --> 35:03.220]  loved around the world by nations that have been under attack by tyrants and again i'm
[35:03.220 --> 35:07.500]  a big supporter of trump because i've been sued and threatened and attacked and harassed
[35:07.500 --> 35:12.620]  over it because i know that he's doing the best job he can and so they just keep more
[35:12.620 --> 35:17.620]  attacks on more tax most other people try to hedge their bets well i'm not hedging my
[35:17.620 --> 35:23.700]  bets when trump starts going sideways the politicians around him i come out of the
[35:23.700 --> 35:30.620]  gates swinging but he's not hillary clinton and i told everybody he's not gonna push
[35:30.620 --> 35:37.820]  the red flag laws he's he's coming to the democrats saying okay what's your proposal
[35:37.820 --> 35:45.980]  they say ban all semiados and have psychological boards that decide whether you have a gun
[35:45.980 --> 35:52.700]  or not outside of law making them judge jury and executioner and jail warden so it's very
[35:52.700 --> 35:58.140]  dangerous to even flirt with that but that's what i was told trump is going to do because
[35:58.140 --> 36:03.980]  it takes the wind out of their sails and then they never come with their so-called reasonable
[36:03.980 --> 36:10.620]  which we know isn't reasonable it's incremental salami slicing and then they shoot for the
[36:10.620 --> 36:16.820]  moon and they miss they're greedy they grab for it all like the global is doing every
[36:16.820 --> 36:23.940]  place they control because as the un said in its own small arms treaty in 2001 civilian
[36:23.940 --> 36:31.260]  ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state that whole statement
[36:31.260 --> 36:37.980]  is very true except one word legitimate civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate
[36:37.980 --> 36:45.220]  power monopoly of the state take out legitimate civilian ownership of firearms threatens the
[36:45.220 --> 36:52.020]  power monopoly of the state which of course it does now sit down all political power goes
[36:52.020 --> 36:57.620]  out of the barrel of a gun and if the people don't have a right to own guns then they're
[36:57.620 --> 37:03.340]  not the lords of their own destiny there's been no culture in history that had rulers
[37:03.340 --> 37:13.180]  and slaves or the slaves could have weapons it's never happened never will happen again
[37:13.180 --> 37:18.780]  so yeah it's a messy affair and tens of thousands get killed a year hundreds of thousands get
[37:18.780 --> 37:24.860]  killed a year from cars and grounding and thousands and thousands falling off jet skis
[37:24.860 --> 37:29.460]  that's the way the world thousands die every year rock climbing more people die every year
[37:29.460 --> 37:33.900]  falling in their bathrooms than they do from guns we're gonna ban bathrooms how about banning
[37:33.900 --> 37:41.460]  existence because that's the only way to ever stop that takes happening if you have children
[37:41.460 --> 37:47.220]  you're putting them in the world to experience pleasure experience triumph experience humiliation
[37:47.220 --> 37:59.140]  experience pain experience visions experiment love and experience communion with the almighty
[37:59.140 --> 38:05.500]  and so you put them into the world but they can experience the third dimension their spirits
[38:05.500 --> 38:15.380]  can look through this rose-colored darkly that is our earth suits in the true transcendence
[38:15.380 --> 38:21.740]  we're all experiencing and the question is will you transcend at death or will you fall
[38:21.740 --> 38:30.300]  are you going up are you going down you're getting more complex or less that's the choice
[38:30.300 --> 38:37.780]  everyone has to make so again here's this phenomenal statement by the president that's
[38:37.780 --> 38:42.020]  so clear and so concise and so smooth because it's true imagine how good it feels just to
[38:42.020 --> 38:46.540]  be able to get up there and not lie to people like Bill Clinton or Obama did actually get
[38:46.540 --> 38:51.140]  up there and tell them the truth that's why they have all these shows Trump's lying to
[38:51.140 --> 38:57.700]  everyone oh we've got 50 buckets of gumballs every gumballs a lie that's a carnival stunt
[38:57.700 --> 39:08.140]  it's not true it's their perception that it's a lie remember our truth over facts Joe Biden
[39:08.140 --> 39:15.860]  our truth our delusion our cult Joe Biden's like full sedum saying come to me my child
[39:15.860 --> 39:21.980]  and the cult member jumps off the cliff and crashes down because that's her truth over
[39:21.980 --> 39:35.420]  facts over reality and then you see to leave the leader of the fantastic rat pack the rats
[39:35.420 --> 39:39.140]  that have left their sinking ships and then come here to perch and bitch and tell us how
[39:39.140 --> 39:43.060]  much we suck all day so they can be victims to get more goodies that's why you can't run
[39:43.060 --> 39:46.500]  your own countries because no one wants to build anything he's gonna run and killing
[39:46.500 --> 39:54.540]  each other because everybody has a right to rule instead of build and then we're told
[39:54.540 --> 40:00.420]  by these fallen twisted individuals that we suck and we're bad because they know we've
[40:00.420 --> 40:06.100]  got those buttons to push and then we'll then grovel to them and they see something like
[40:06.100 --> 40:11.900]  Trump saying the long surrender of America is over and it's quite a fight we've been
[40:11.900 --> 40:17.300]  surrendered for a long time but you're seeing the real animating contest of liberty here
[40:17.300 --> 40:23.180]  is again the president's full statement on he's been chosen he looks to God chosen by
[40:23.180 --> 40:27.420]  God really you think so 45th president you think God chooses presidents you better hope
[40:27.420 --> 40:42.620]  God's choosing him here it is the fake news of which many of your members is trying to
[40:42.620 --> 40:47.980]  convince the public to have a recession let's have a recession the United States is doing
[40:47.980 --> 40:54.620]  phenomenally well but one thing I have to do is economically take on China because China
[40:54.620 --> 41:00.340]  has been ripping us off for many years president Clinton president Bush and president Obama
[41:00.340 --> 41:06.340]  and others should have done this long before me my life would be much easier although I
[41:06.340 --> 41:12.900]  enjoy doing it but my life would be much easier if I just said let China continue to rip off
[41:12.900 --> 41:17.940]  the United States all right be much easier but I can't do that we are winning against
[41:17.940 --> 41:23.100]  China they've lost two and a half million jobs in a very short period of time they want to
[41:23.100 --> 41:27.740]  make a deal it's got to be a deal that's good for the United States where they want to make
[41:27.740 --> 41:33.620]  a deal probably we will make a deal but if I didn't do that and I'm not doing that somebody
[41:33.620 --> 41:39.260]  said it's Trump's trade war this isn't my trade war this is a trade war that should
[41:39.260 --> 41:44.300]  have taken place a long time ago by a lot of other presidents over the last five or
[41:44.300 --> 41:53.780]  six years China's made $500 billion $500 billion ripped it out of the United States and not
[41:53.780 --> 42:00.380]  only that if you take a look intellectual property theft add that to it and add a lot
[42:00.380 --> 42:07.540]  of other things to it so somebody excuse me somebody had to do it I am the chosen one
[42:07.540 --> 42:13.340]  somebody had to do it so I'm taking on China I'm taking on China on trade and you know
[42:13.340 --> 42:18.180]  what we're winning because we're the piggy bank okay and then he goes on from there to
[42:18.180 --> 42:23.260]  talk about how he was brought there by the people but remember China was set up by the
[42:23.260 --> 42:27.500]  globalist so they have all the deals with the generals and the Politburo and the Central
[42:27.500 --> 42:31.540]  Committee and they're sending that money all back a lot of it to the Democrats and the
[42:31.540 --> 42:38.500]  globalist and they all brag about this so they sit around or such geniuses the American
[42:38.500 --> 42:42.820]  centuries over China will rule the planet the dragon century and there are a bunch of
[42:42.820 --> 42:50.940]  traders that should be prosecuted and then ever convicted should be punished as such
[42:50.940 --> 42:54.820]  and that's just facts that's not me shooting my mouth off folks we all know what needs
[42:54.820 --> 43:01.380]  to be done legally it's not only that you have a unique voice in the public arena in
[43:01.380 --> 43:05.780]  the public square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it isn't the only network
[43:05.780 --> 43:10.300]  of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's not
[43:10.300 --> 43:14.340]  backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by secret foreign government it is
[43:14.340 --> 43:19.820]  completely independent of all that it is an old school American 1776 style experiment
[43:19.820 --> 43:23.780]  in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders
[43:23.780 --> 43:27.420]  were so concerned with at the beginning of the country they actually tried to support
[43:27.420 --> 43:31.700]  and subsidize organizations just like this because this was the kind of press they wanted
[43:31.700 --> 43:35.180]  and then ultimately we now live in an era where they've mostly been co-opted by big
[43:35.180 --> 43:39.220]  corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate
[43:39.220 --> 43:43.780]  what news and views view a person's allowed to have or express or hear and the info wars
[43:43.780 --> 43:48.620]  audience has broken through that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern
[43:48.620 --> 43:52.500]  age ultimate American democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[43:52.500 --> 43:59.100]  onslaught of the black warming defamation law fair and libel targeting you serving with
[43:59.100 --> 44:06.620]  info wars is a great honor but I still need my morning coffee and luckily our break room

[45:04.900 --> 45:09.220]  in the future it would be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality
[45:09.220 --> 45:13.100]  who actually worked for a living that would end up saving the nation and today the communist
[45:13.100 --> 45:18.780]  Chinese have banned all US farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases
[45:18.780 --> 45:24.020]  in polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once China put
[45:24.020 --> 45:28.940]  pressure on our farmers that's beautiful Americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't

[48:19.660 --> 48:24.740]  engorged maggot bitching and complaining a psychopath a sociopath bare minimum trying
[48:24.740 --> 48:30.140]  to punch our buttons because we have emotions you big fat demon here she is a young girl
[48:30.140 --> 48:34.980]  visiting Palestine to see my grandparents and extended family I watched as my mother
[48:34.980 --> 48:46.020]  had to go to do humanizing checkpoints how about dehumanizing suicide bombs the United
[48:46.020 --> 48:53.580]  States citizen and proud American I was there when my city was in a terrible car accident
[48:53.580 --> 48:59.020]  and my cousins and I cried so she could have access to the best hospitals which were in
[48:59.020 --> 49:05.500]  Jerusalem I remember shaking with fear when checkpoints appeared in the small village
[49:05.500 --> 49:10.700]  of bed over the focus oh it passed for a minute because they got a raw feed when I was watching
[49:10.700 --> 49:14.700]  on Fox it showed all the lunatic women up there all these crazy leftist women that look
[49:14.700 --> 49:21.900]  like starving chicken neck birds or like something out of a Dr. Seuss children's book and they're
[49:21.900 --> 49:26.740]  all crying and putting on this big act what happens when you boycott a country they boycott
[49:26.740 --> 49:31.460]  you you say Israel should be overthrown but your whole life you're trying to get in there
[49:31.460 --> 49:37.320]  and get some free stuff oh and I know I know it belongs to the Arabs because you took it
[49:37.320 --> 49:43.180]  away from the Jews I get how that works but see Islam just keeps expanding and so if one
[49:43.180 --> 49:48.220]  little spot goes back to anybody who ever had a claim to it it's the end of the world
[49:48.220 --> 49:53.420]  there's no media coverage of people whining about Saudi Arabia chopping gays heads off
[49:53.420 --> 50:00.620]  or how the West Bank that you support kills gays you love it which you're a hypocrite
[50:00.620 --> 50:05.100]  you're a pig I'm sorry I got all this stuff to get to I just when you see this stuff in
[50:05.100 --> 50:10.500]  the whining and is Israel perfect absolutely not but the just the way it's all oh black
[50:10.500 --> 50:16.180]  and white and oh the Muslims they never heard nobody and I saw articles out yesterday fact
[50:16.180 --> 50:20.420]  checkers are gonna stop people claiming Islam is behind terror because remember Obama said
[50:20.420 --> 50:25.020]  that's not Islam how the hell did it expand then in fourteen hundred years to take over
[50:25.020 --> 50:30.300]  half the planning playing playing tiddly wings they could overran all those other empires
[50:30.300 --> 50:36.540]  and things as it was friendly do I want to go over there and bomb the Middle East absolutely
[50:36.540 --> 50:39.260]  not the globalist did that to destabilize the Middle East and take out regimes that
[50:39.260 --> 50:44.820]  were not globalist or expansionist to put in ISIS and Al Qaeda to then break the borders
[50:44.820 --> 50:50.700]  of Europe they're gestating it is a big weapon system I'm gonna give the number out to take

[51:21.980 --> 51:28.380]  people working under death and killing him as a concentration camp the British inventive
[51:28.380 --> 51:33.980]  not the Nazis and Andrew Jackson's mother and brother died in one when he was in the
[51:33.980 --> 51:39.500]  Revolutionary War read a few history books you know they know that's where they starve
[51:39.500 --> 51:45.140]  you to death nobody starved to death these are emergency centers people are pouring
[51:45.140 --> 51:51.620]  in most of them don't even have IDs and we're checking who they are and then releasing them
[51:51.620 --> 51:55.940]  and you know that you pig like liar and now you're saying we're running concentration
[51:55.940 --> 52:02.860]  camps just like you say Israel is it's the same branding the same crap by a whiny parasite
[52:02.860 --> 52:10.500]  and I'm done bowing to you and the Democratic Party let's go back to her I remember visiting
[52:10.500 --> 52:16.620]  East Jerusalem with my then husband and him escorting escorted off the bus although he
[52:16.620 --> 52:22.780]  was a United States citizen just so security forces could harass him here let's stop again
[52:22.780 --> 52:29.740]  oh you want to overthrow Israel you stage all these events and then you can't believe that
[52:29.740 --> 52:36.020]  when you drive in from the West Bank that were suicide bombers attack routinely and
[52:36.020 --> 52:40.140]  people are stabbed to death on a weekly basis and shot you can't believe anybody at their
[52:40.140 --> 52:46.380]  borders checking you meanwhile as a U.S. citizen I have to have my balls grabbed because they
[52:46.380 --> 52:51.060]  won't profile Islamists when I go to the stupid airport because the Muslims have been hijacking
[52:51.060 --> 52:59.540]  an aircraft for 60 damn years which I get to live in a police state because the globalist
[52:59.540 --> 53:04.460]  have let you run wild on purpose and Trump is trying to do something about it and end
[53:04.460 --> 53:13.180]  all these wars and stop stirring you up let's go back to her as my city's granddaughter
[53:13.180 --> 53:17.100]  as the as the great daughter of the political president of my territory is to elevate her
[53:17.100 --> 53:23.420]  voice by exposing the truth the only way I know how as my Detroit public schools teachers
[53:23.420 --> 53:29.940]  taught me sure round out the ground in the pain of oppression our delegation oh my gosh
[53:29.940 --> 53:34.700]  it's so oppressive let me into Israel oh my gosh it's so oppressive let me into America

[54:01.180 --> 54:06.940]  areas hate those Islamists they've been getting killed by him and grabbed by him for a thousand
[54:06.940 --> 54:17.020]  years this woman is an abomination let's continue to participate in military occupation they
[54:17.020 --> 54:23.220]  also desperately want peace and self-determination for their Palestinian neighbors they could
[54:23.220 --> 54:28.460]  have shed light into injustice you know all the Muslims do is blow each other up let's
[54:28.460 --> 54:35.700]  continue child detention the delegation would have seen firsthand why walls are destructive
[54:35.700 --> 54:41.740]  not productive they could have asked the people in Bethlehem how walls cut people off away
[54:41.740 --> 54:47.660]  from economic opportunities from a way to live and let's stop right there I can't listen
[54:47.660 --> 54:52.340]  to much more of this now now let's hear talk about her grandmother and the bird cage this
[54:52.340 --> 54:58.040]  is this is really really really cute again ladies and gentlemen this is all to manipulate
[54:58.040 --> 55:04.580]  your heartstrings and again she doesn't say a word about all the stuff that's going on
[55:04.580 --> 55:09.300]  our Christians in the last few holdouts the Middle East being blown up and killed hundreds
[55:09.300 --> 55:14.740]  of Christian churches blown up in Egypt and our own government under Obama backing it
[55:14.740 --> 55:19.140]  there's no press conferences for them she won't say a word in fact I haven't gotten
[55:19.140 --> 55:25.660]  to the show that's why I was playing this I I need to play the young Turks host I should
[55:25.660 --> 55:28.220]  have led the show with us this is what got me thinking about all this and then I'm kind
[55:28.220 --> 55:36.980]  of as always you get into the first part last where he says we deserve 9-11 and that veterans
[55:36.980 --> 55:40.420]  deserve to be killed we're gonna play that coming up but let's play her talking about
[55:40.420 --> 55:46.220]  the bird here it is to my family and I think my grandmother said it beautifully when she
[55:46.220 --> 55:53.820]  said I'm her ass food ass food in Arabic means her bird and she said I'm her dream manifested
[55:53.820 --> 56:00.420]  I am her free bird so why would I come back and be caged and bow down when my election
[56:00.420 --> 56:04.780]  exactly you came here to crap on us to turn her off I can't hear anymore about it ladies
[56:04.780 --> 56:08.860]  and gentlemen it's just it's the same playbook being used against Israel's being used against
[56:08.860 --> 56:12.820]  cost does that mean the US is perfect notice that mean Israel's perfect no but making the
[56:12.820 --> 56:18.620]  US the bad guy constantly it's all the same crap why is everybody trying to get in here
[56:18.620 --> 56:23.020]  if we're so bad same thing with Israel and I'm just I'm tired of it and the left's making
[56:23.020 --> 56:27.980]  their big move right now for racial and cultural division if the muslims want to live in peace
[56:27.980 --> 56:32.900]  and want to change their ways to have a referendum have a like I guess Martin Luther you know
[56:32.900 --> 56:40.660]  had a renaissance that's great but it's not gonna happen until the expansionist operations
[56:40.660 --> 56:45.740]  of Islam stop and it needs to happen now and I agree with Trump let's get our troops out
[56:45.740 --> 56:49.820]  of there and not stir it up either I was against all those wars I was against 500,000 dead
[56:49.820 --> 56:53.540]  Iraqi children that Madeleine Albright said was a good price to pay with Clinton quadrupled
[56:53.540 --> 56:58.180]  the sanctions on them I actually care about the people and I know what a hypocrite that
[56:58.180 --> 57:06.100]  woman is and how the greatest victims of Islam are the muslims Christians are second and

[1:00:33.500 --> 1:00:38.660]  of the young Turks the young Turks is the name of a anti-Christian genocide movement
[1:00:38.660 --> 1:00:44.980]  of brown shirts that Hitler actually modeled the brown shirts off of you you can't make
[1:00:44.980 --> 1:00:51.740]  this up Hitler along with a lot of his top people are actually anti-Christian and that's
[1:00:51.740 --> 1:00:57.620]  a fact I've read the books they wrote okay and Ludendorff look at Ludendorff Hitler's
[1:00:57.620 --> 1:01:04.700]  number two for a long time literally ran a cult that was anti-Christian but I'm digressing
[1:01:04.700 --> 1:01:10.900]  I'm gonna play this clip it is it is just monstrously sickening and the venom that just it brings
[1:01:10.900 --> 1:01:18.700]  my venom out and so the young Turks think we're all stupid when the demonic toad sinker

[1:02:52.980 --> 1:02:59.460]  Doug next segment spoke to Brandon first in Texas Brandon thanks for holding it on the
[1:02:59.460 --> 1:03:04.460]  air thank you so much Alex and I pray to God for you every night thank you I need our out
[1:03:04.460 --> 1:03:10.580]  here absolutely listen my biggest takeaway from this Dr. Robert Epstein and the wonderful
[1:03:10.580 --> 1:03:19.220]  Zach Voorhees okay is that while it's wonderful that we have the vehicle towards prosecution
[1:03:19.220 --> 1:03:25.540]  that is the election meddling element of the whole Google expose the biggest takeaway is
[1:03:25.540 --> 1:03:31.500]  the question of are you brainwashed we now have indisputable evidence that if you follow
[1:03:31.500 --> 1:03:37.420]  the left and you follow the narrative of whites are inherently bad or America sucks then guess
[1:03:37.420 --> 1:03:45.400]  what it's your brainwash literally I mean that's it and and you know even on Bill
[1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:50.260]  Mars show even the Democrats are having to admit wow the anti-white thing we've done
[1:03:50.260 --> 1:03:56.260]  in the U.S. has been so potent it's now spread to everyone hating Israel because they're
[1:03:56.260 --> 1:04:02.620]  white err and it's just it's insane whites are only 9% of the world's population and
[1:04:02.620 --> 1:04:06.660]  let's just say it everybody's trying to get in our countries and there's a simple reason
[1:04:06.660 --> 1:04:12.340]  we got Christianity we were living you know in the trees and in the caves like the you
[1:04:12.340 --> 1:04:16.780]  know new black Israelites like the joke and it's true I mean had high IQ smart people
[1:04:16.780 --> 1:04:22.820]  but we were living like savages like in Africa because we were not Christian the minute we
[1:04:22.820 --> 1:04:27.940]  got it we went straight to the moon and you know what's what we need is like got milk
[1:04:27.940 --> 1:04:33.060]  got Jesus that's what produces success and that's what's going to unify the planet together
[1:04:33.060 --> 1:04:37.380]  under Christ it's the only way we're not going to destroy ourselves doesn't mean we're going
[1:04:37.380 --> 1:04:41.980]  to force you to serve Christ Christ doesn't do that the door is always open the way is
[1:04:41.980 --> 1:04:47.740]  Jesus of Nazareth that is the global unification the anti-Christ will have his counterfeit first
[1:04:47.740 --> 1:04:52.540]  then we will have the true global unification world order under Jesus Christ stay with us
[1:04:52.540 --> 1:04:53.540]  for the right back.
[1:04:53.540 --> 1:04:54.540]  Yes.
[1:04:54.540 --> 1:05:03.020]  I got a plug for the Patriot points I get $180 so far this year and I feel like I'm stealing
[1:05:03.020 --> 1:05:04.020]  from you.
[1:05:04.020 --> 1:05:07.100]  I buy so much in the store because I mean I don't want to give that money to Walmart
[1:05:07.100 --> 1:05:10.060]  I don't want to give that money to people are going to donate it to causes I don't believe
[1:05:10.060 --> 1:05:13.380]  in so I rather give that money to you and they're getting quality products the products
[1:05:13.380 --> 1:05:18.180]  that I do receive have changed my life I mean the X2 has really done a lot for me I've lost
[1:05:18.180 --> 1:05:22.460]  weight my brain works a whole lot better I think my kids they use the toothpaste my son
[1:05:22.460 --> 1:05:26.500]  used to get these little sore throat and he puts X2 in water and drinks it and it gets
[1:05:26.500 --> 1:05:27.500]  rid of his sore throat.
[1:05:27.500 --> 1:05:31.980]  Let me break this down for you I want high quality stuff in there I want a good price
[1:05:31.980 --> 1:05:36.460]  but I've kind of obituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50% off I'm making
[1:05:36.460 --> 1:05:40.980]  $2 on my toothpaste 50% off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric
[1:05:40.980 --> 1:05:44.900]  or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the Patriot
[1:05:44.900 --> 1:05:49.100]  points a lot of times it makes things a loss later because if you're already getting 10%
[1:05:49.100 --> 1:05:52.660]  off because you're on auto ship then we'll do a 50% off and then you do something like
[1:05:52.660 --> 1:06:19.980]  that we have Patriot points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support.
[1:06:19.980 --> 1:06:31.980]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance live from Austin Texas

[1:09:55.700 --> 1:09:59.420]  capabilities so that that's part of what we're doing the other part is just knowledge we

[1:10:10.900 --> 1:10:15.580]  10 seconds oh like the Armenians deserved because they were there before the Muslims took over
[1:10:15.580 --> 1:10:19.300]  Constantinople and you drove them into the mountains but because they were Christian they

[1:12:26.820 --> 1:12:34.180]  having to play that for everybody but that's why I was so angry this morning I mean this
[1:12:34.180 --> 1:12:40.220]  is this is this is all completely out of control all right I said I'd go to your phone calls
[1:12:40.220 --> 1:12:45.740]  we're going to your phone calls Doug wants to make a good point because I see Beto said
[1:12:45.740 --> 1:12:49.780]  he was the anointed one the chosen one out in the desert seemed like he was Jesus Trump
[1:12:49.780 --> 1:12:54.420]  just said I was elected by the people and you know chosen he looks up to God like a preacher
[1:12:54.420 --> 1:12:59.100]  says I was I was chosen I was anointed you know God commissioned my heart to go into
[1:12:59.100 --> 1:13:04.860]  the seminary and that's a totally normal statement and Trump's kidding he's always been Christian
[1:13:04.860 --> 1:13:09.980]  as a traditionalist but not really you know me tell you Trump has had conversations with
[1:13:09.980 --> 1:13:15.740]  me about the energy at churches and black churches particularly we talk about energy
[1:13:15.740 --> 1:13:20.140]  at crowds and that's the kind of me and that's how me and Trump hook up you know what I mean
[1:13:20.140 --> 1:13:24.500]  and yeah I'm the same wavelength and it's all about energy you see and and Trump's into
[1:13:24.500 --> 1:13:29.260]  it and Trump loves Jesus here let's go ahead and pull up I'll go to your call Doug thanks
[1:13:29.260 --> 1:13:33.500]  for holding go ahead from Connecticut afternoon Alex I don't brother good what do you want
[1:13:33.500 --> 1:13:38.140]  to chime in on about Beto and message to Trump chosen one comment well it's not with Trump
[1:13:38.140 --> 1:13:44.060]  that I haven't seen Trump yet make a comment that is stupid I guess would be the word
[1:13:44.060 --> 1:13:47.660]  because he puts the comments out and then the left rolls with it and they make you know
[1:13:47.660 --> 1:13:55.180]  fools in himself so if if you can't see that Trump is doing Christ like things for this
[1:13:55.180 --> 1:13:59.500]  country in the world if you can't see the opposite side of evil out there you're not
[1:13:59.500 --> 1:14:04.620]  looking in the right place you know what I mean you know a man by his enemies and evil
[1:14:04.620 --> 1:14:09.380]  is having a you know what fit they are pulling their hair out oh yeah I've never seen any
[1:14:09.380 --> 1:14:15.500]  it's very spiritual it's the spiritual war that's what it is you know anyways with Beto
[1:14:15.500 --> 1:14:20.900]  I call him I call him Peter the dork and I found out who I think they cloned him from
[1:14:20.900 --> 1:14:24.620]  you know you know what the car dealerships they have the wood is that flailing arm two
[1:14:24.620 --> 1:14:30.460]  men there he has a rhythm cadence of one of those things and I was watching something
[1:14:30.460 --> 1:14:36.460]  on the Nazis last night and Joseph Goebbels had the same distorted rhythm that Beto has
[1:14:36.460 --> 1:14:44.700]  unbelievable I mean Beto radiates con artist he radiates the fraud he radiates dis disingenuous
[1:14:44.700 --> 1:14:49.660]  justice I mean just I can't look at it he just radiates fraud you look at Trump he just
[1:14:49.660 --> 1:14:55.340]  radiates reality I mean I'm sorry my spirit goes that's the truth that guys for real and
[1:14:55.340 --> 1:14:59.700]  my guts never wrong I look at Beto or Bill Clinton they call him a good speaker I mean
[1:14:59.700 --> 1:15:04.220]  I couldn't stand Bill Clinton the Hillary Clinton looks like a jack-o-lantern demon and then
[1:15:04.220 --> 1:15:09.100]  Beto or you know yeah pull back on my name is for TV viewers he's got his hands in his
[1:15:09.100 --> 1:15:15.540]  pockets you know or behind his back like Ronald Reagan would do it's all phony it's he did
[1:15:15.540 --> 1:15:20.380]  he sucked and notice he was their messiah from the desert he was their Jesus of Nazareth
[1:15:20.380 --> 1:15:26.020]  where is he now where did his campaigning in Mexico get him where did his blaming America
[1:15:26.020 --> 1:15:32.460]  for the anti-fugue I oh yeah that's what it was down there in El Paso it got him nowhere

[1:18:30.820 --> 1:18:35.940]  cost us three times more because we have it put through the expensive laboratory process

[1:18:59.580 --> 1:19:02.860]  are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face
[1:19:02.860 --> 1:19:07.060]  no consequence of social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over
[1:19:07.060 --> 1:19:10.980]  two decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the members
[1:19:10.980 --> 1:19:14.460]  of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary members of the public in
[1:19:14.460 --> 1:19:18.820]  the audience that care about this have to bring real social political economic consequence
[1:19:18.820 --> 1:19:21.900]  to their course of conduct otherwise they will never change and they will become the
[1:19:21.900 --> 1:19:25.940]  big tech oligarchs the equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American
[1:19:25.940 --> 1:19:29.940]  politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover
[1:19:29.940 --> 1:19:35.060]  after the Great Depression the inforce audience is the fuel that flames the the light of liberty
[1:19:35.060 --> 1:19:39.540]  across the world to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the
[1:19:39.540 --> 1:19:43.740]  original promise of an independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media
[1:19:43.740 --> 1:19:47.500]  that manipulating and working with each other to try to meddle with elections to try to
[1:19:47.500 --> 1:19:51.260]  shake people's thoughts and then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening
[1:19:51.260 --> 1:19:55.140]  it's the ultimate form of gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even
[1:19:55.140 --> 1:20:02.180]  it is what what you just saw you're listening to the alex jones show

[1:21:02.700 --> 1:21:09.020]  are competitors like 300 bucks we usually sell them for 250 discounted 170 something
[1:21:09.020 --> 1:21:13.100]  it's it's ridiculous and we've got a few of those pro-pures and election peers left that

[1:22:11.180 --> 1:22:16.460]  Hey Alex I got some 2020 presidential news but first I just want to ask you where do these
[1:22:16.460 --> 1:22:22.340]  people get these names I mean you got Epstein's girlfriend there Giz Lane Maxwell I mean it's
[1:22:22.340 --> 1:22:26.520]  like some girl you know in high school or something you know then you got Pete Bucking
[1:22:26.520 --> 1:22:30.180]  over there Dick Painter and let's not forget like fuck Sexton.
[1:22:30.180 --> 1:22:34.740]  Well sure I mean I mean it's like Dirk Diggler Dirk Diggler all of this is a joke Beto is
[1:22:34.740 --> 1:22:39.740]  not his name I appreciate your call when you're down in Mexico you see people named Beto but
[1:22:39.740 --> 1:22:45.300]  it's just made up that they're carpet backers and I just see a carpet backers anybody coming
[1:22:45.300 --> 1:22:51.020]  from one place to another to abuse people they see that are rural and the the the the
[1:22:51.020 --> 1:22:59.260]  ororics are just in my view a criminal syndicate and his wife and his father-in-law are just
[1:22:59.260 --> 1:23:03.700]  horrible globalist and so he's just a criminal that's all he is and so if he can like go
[1:23:03.700 --> 1:23:10.900]  oh I'm Beto Hispanics can't stand that everybody can't stand being manipulated like that I mean
[1:23:10.900 --> 1:23:17.180]  imagine if I was a car salesman and I walked out to a spanish family and I just expected
[1:23:17.180 --> 1:23:23.620]  they don't like America and that they don't speak English I go would you like taco and
[1:23:23.620 --> 1:23:29.820]  all how you do I don't like America they'd be like well I'm about a car I love America
[1:23:29.820 --> 1:23:34.900]  it's it's it's the way they treat people and it's rich white people and I'm not just saying
[1:23:34.900 --> 1:23:39.060]  that they get brownie points bashing white people because that's in it's weird billionaire
[1:23:39.060 --> 1:23:44.540]  white people that have no connection to reality that play all these race games Trump comes
[1:23:44.540 --> 1:23:49.340]  from his dad was blue collar self-made Trump worked all the blue collar folks he knows
[1:23:49.340 --> 1:23:53.700]  how to get stuff done he's a guy that gets down in the trenches and he just straight
[1:23:53.700 --> 1:23:57.620]  shoots the same you ever hear Trump put on a weird accent for some group of people you
[1:23:57.620 --> 1:24:02.620]  ever heard me do that I've been around liberals and you'll have a Hispanic waiter and they'll
[1:24:02.620 --> 1:24:10.220]  go how you do and the person like I'm doing just fine it's condescending it's a joke and
[1:24:10.220 --> 1:24:16.060]  all the studies show liberals virtue signal and dumb their words down for minorities I
[1:24:16.060 --> 1:24:21.060]  mean the black person walks over to me I don't go how are you doing today can you talk I mean
[1:24:21.060 --> 1:24:26.180]  it's so insulting be around white liberals man I've been around my whole life seeing it
[1:24:26.180 --> 1:24:33.820]  they will talk to Hispanics and black folks like their idiots it's disgusting I'm sorry
[1:24:33.820 --> 1:24:38.780]  I'm ranting I'm out of control here Josh from Georgia you're on the air thanks for holding
[1:24:38.780 --> 1:24:44.780]  welcome hey Alex long time listener I just wanted to say thank you so much for everything
[1:24:44.780 --> 1:24:51.780]  that you have shown me over the years I want to plug the iodine x2 I've been taking it
[1:24:51.780 --> 1:24:56.860]  for like three weeks and we found out a couple days ago that my wife is pregnant so that
[1:24:56.860 --> 1:25:03.580]  was awesome I wanted to talk about Trump being the chosen one I mean just all across the
[1:25:03.580 --> 1:25:07.980]  board man that guy is so smart like he'll say something and you won't see anything for
[1:25:07.980 --> 1:25:11.900]  like three or four weeks and then all of a sudden you'll see him bring that back into
[1:25:11.900 --> 1:25:17.060]  play the pet of that's why they all say he's so dumb it's why they all say he doesn't
[1:25:17.060 --> 1:25:22.220]  know what he's doing oh he's senile meanwhile Joe Biden cannot say a single sentence I watch
[1:25:22.220 --> 1:25:25.820]  his speeches I'm like oh maybe these are compilations and I'll be I'll watch a speech
[1:25:25.820 --> 1:25:31.340]  once on TV and it's like wow I'm three minutes in he's done two gaffes he's mumbling every
[1:25:31.340 --> 1:25:37.820]  other word this is unwatchable yeah they have to be in panic mode right now and it's so funny
[1:25:37.820 --> 1:25:42.500]  because there's no way anybody up there is going to be Trump one other thing I wanted
[1:25:42.500 --> 1:25:48.500]  to say is a couple weeks ago as you mentioned shepherds chapel and man I used to listen
[1:25:48.500 --> 1:25:53.980]  to them for years and it's almost like that's the only place I can go and like really get
[1:25:53.980 --> 1:25:58.020]  a good study of the Bible churches nowadays they like say one scripture and then they
[1:25:58.020 --> 1:26:03.300]  give a whole sermon on like some man may thought but like you are like the shepherds chapel
[1:26:03.300 --> 1:26:09.060]  man like really getting down to the nitty-gritty and well here's what I try to do I try to
[1:26:09.060 --> 1:26:14.140]  be honest and so when I'm angry and stuff I'm angry on air and sometimes it sounds like
[1:26:14.140 --> 1:26:18.660]  I'm being pretty nasty I'm just being real how I feel at a gut level and I'm worldly
[1:26:18.660 --> 1:26:24.580]  I have a you know fleshful side that's the rose color you know darkly I love God I have
[1:26:24.580 --> 1:26:28.740]  the Holy Ghost all of it but I am a worldly mean aggressive person and I don't like being
[1:26:28.740 --> 1:26:32.140]  pissed on and I'm just here trying to get conservatives and Christians no matter what
[1:26:32.140 --> 1:26:37.380]  color you are and just veterans gun owners people that want to be free to stop rolling
[1:26:37.380 --> 1:26:41.420]  over you don't need to go out and have a war or bomb something or shoot somebody don't
[1:26:41.420 --> 1:26:46.740]  do that obviously you're not you need to aggressively defend your ground and aggressively start
[1:26:46.740 --> 1:26:51.580]  shooting your mouth off and then also reaching out to others that are on the fence this is
[1:26:51.580 --> 1:26:55.460]  a war they want to bully us and they're not going to get what they're looking for as I've
[1:26:55.460 --> 1:26:59.260]  said a million times I don't know how it's going in for him for wars but I don't know
[1:26:59.260 --> 1:27:03.180]  how it ends in the end for everybody and we win but if they want to fight they better
[1:27:03.180 --> 1:27:07.940]  believe they got one God bless you okay Josh thank you Charles in Colorado you're on the
[1:27:07.940 --> 1:27:13.140]  air sir welcome. Hey Alex how you doing? I'm good brother good talking to you. Hey nice
[1:27:13.140 --> 1:27:18.580]  guys it's you I've been listening to you every day since back in 2015 when uh Trump came
[1:27:18.580 --> 1:27:22.260]  on there was getting ready to run and so that rollercoaster ride of all the you know the
[1:27:22.260 --> 1:27:27.900]  gifts that you had talking about the Hillary Clinton and all that but Donald Trump is the
[1:27:27.900 --> 1:27:33.020]  ultimate president I cannot even begin to talk about everything that he's done I don't
[1:27:33.020 --> 1:27:37.700]  see how people don't see what all this good stuff he's doing. I mean I've got to say that's
[1:27:37.700 --> 1:27:42.020]  why he models himself after Andrew Jackson because Andrew Jackson was even better badass
[1:27:42.020 --> 1:27:47.660]  than George Washington and it's a close second for Washington but I mean Jackson was like
[1:27:47.660 --> 1:27:52.660]  you talk about anointed you talk about unkillable I mean they basically said the guy was a zombie
[1:27:52.660 --> 1:27:56.940]  I mean you could shoot him stab him whatever he worked three days in a row no sleep never
[1:27:56.940 --> 1:28:02.580]  never defeated I mean he was the real deal he was in war from ages 10 to 16 the Revolutionary
[1:28:02.580 --> 1:28:07.980]  War as a message runner he was killing people by 11 so I mean I'm just telling you talk
[1:28:07.980 --> 1:28:13.460]  about Commando Conan the Barbarian it was Andrew Jackson but absolutely Trump is amazing
[1:28:13.460 --> 1:28:17.060]  and we should celebrate the fact that he's amazing compared to all the trash we've had
[1:28:17.060 --> 1:28:20.820]  they don't want us to celebrate Trump they want us to be embarrassed I will celebrate
[1:28:20.820 --> 1:28:27.940]  Trump more than ever I realize that's key to do what do you say the most important thing
[1:28:27.940 --> 1:28:35.380]  I think he's done spiritual level that he's exposed everything that we've been talking
[1:28:35.380 --> 1:28:39.420]  you've been talking God bless you Charles yes it's a spiritual battle that is the critical
[1:28:39.420 --> 1:28:43.780]  key we'll be back with Ryan Ronnie and others and our special guest in studio stay with

[1:35:35.780 --> 1:35:40.500]  now it's it's really art it's it's it's modern political illustrations and google and facebook
[1:35:40.500 --> 1:35:45.940]  and twitter have made it public enemy number one again i harp on this because they wouldn't let the
[1:35:45.940 --> 1:35:51.460]  rnc put out a meme it's just a card like you know rock bands has come to our show and has some art
[1:35:51.460 --> 1:35:56.340]  and some images and you know a saying it's it's art advertising something or promoting an idea
[1:35:56.340 --> 1:36:02.020]  imparting something and they said oh you can't say that because some people aren't women that's the
[1:36:02.020 --> 1:36:08.820]  level of cult-like mental illness beyond 1984 now zack vorhees on twitter at perpetual maniac
[1:36:08.820 --> 1:36:14.420]  before you get into part two and and and phone calls and and and just you know you know you're
[1:36:14.420 --> 1:36:20.340]  the big whistleblower as other whistleblowers have said you are the edward snowden with the data
[1:36:20.340 --> 1:36:25.140]  dump you put out it's massive and i want to get into so many areas with you today but but first
[1:36:25.140 --> 1:36:29.780]  what has it been like for you in the last three weeks uh since you emerged since you went public
[1:36:29.780 --> 1:36:37.380]  since you resigned from google uh this this disclosure has turned into a cultural movement
[1:36:37.380 --> 1:36:44.420]  um it's a snowball that keeps on getting larger and larger and larger and it turns out that
[1:36:44.980 --> 1:36:49.700]  everyone's had problems with google censorship especially the content creators on youtube
[1:36:50.260 --> 1:36:55.860]  and they're all looking for you know someone that is going to bring them together in order to
[1:36:55.860 --> 1:37:03.300]  unify the voice so that we can confront google and hold them to their own standards of representing
[1:37:03.300 --> 1:37:11.780]  the user representing their voice and making the world's information like um universally accessible
[1:37:11.780 --> 1:37:16.260]  which is one of their mission statements and they're not they're not beholden to their own
[1:37:16.260 --> 1:37:20.580]  mission statement and we're going to hold them up to their own standard so you know this is this
[1:37:20.580 --> 1:37:27.140]  is a cultural movement i didn't realize how big this was going to get but uh here we are and i'm
[1:37:27.140 --> 1:37:33.860]  dedicated to pushing this uh as far as we can take it we were talking last night or i guess
[1:37:33.860 --> 1:37:39.060]  day after noon you were really eloquent we were in there having lunch together and and you were
[1:37:39.060 --> 1:37:43.460]  almost shaking and it was almost religious you were talking about the weight off you but getting
[1:37:43.460 --> 1:37:48.420]  into it more and how how good it's felt to do this versus what it was like being awake at google
[1:37:48.420 --> 1:37:52.980]  the last few years the last three of your eight and and feeling dirty and bad because that's the
[1:37:52.980 --> 1:37:58.420]  greatest currency in the universe kind of repeat what you said over over salad yeah so you know
[1:37:58.420 --> 1:38:05.860]  when i was at google i was part of this system of um what i would call cultural subversion it
[1:38:05.860 --> 1:38:12.260]  didn't start off that way but that's what it became and um i felt guilty because i was taking
[1:38:12.260 --> 1:38:17.860]  money from the system and it was giving me a very comfortable life and uh it was sort of buying my
[1:38:17.860 --> 1:38:24.660]  silence and i felt that i was personally being enriched but that i was doing something i was
[1:38:24.660 --> 1:38:32.580]  part of something that was fundamentally evil and so you know when i came forward and i disclosed
[1:38:32.580 --> 1:38:38.980]  what google was really doing to the population it was an act of an atonement you know i was taking
[1:38:38.980 --> 1:38:46.740]  this burden that was on my soul and i was releasing it and true alchemy spiritual alchemy you were
[1:38:46.740 --> 1:38:54.180]  transmuting it i was transmuting it i was transmuting this thing that was um for lack of a better
[1:38:54.180 --> 1:39:02.500]  word sinful and turning it into uh an act of disclosure an act of awakening an act of revelation
[1:39:02.500 --> 1:39:07.140]  for the people to understand what's really going on well that's the thing the left always acts like
[1:39:07.140 --> 1:39:13.860]  you can come to them for redemption but you can only get redemption with your own soul and your
[1:39:13.860 --> 1:39:18.660]  own personal decisions you make with the universe and the left and all the studies the most unhappy
[1:39:18.660 --> 1:39:22.900]  people out there because they're not real liberals classical liberals you know were the most happy
[1:39:22.900 --> 1:39:27.860]  people in older studies now the terms mean nothing but but people say man you're such a hero never
[1:39:27.860 --> 1:39:33.860]  backing down i am as high as a kite on this when i plug in to tell the truth i get high too much
[1:39:33.860 --> 1:39:38.340]  energy it's people say what drugs are you on other than like caffeine and occasionally some alcohol
[1:39:38.340 --> 1:39:45.060]  whatever nothing but but i'm surging with this because it's human destiny it's spirit it's will
[1:39:45.060 --> 1:39:50.180]  and so people call it thanking me i'm like you're thanking me for doing this any persecution or
[1:39:50.180 --> 1:39:56.900]  attacks or pain is nothing compared to the ecstasy of telling the truth right and someone that is
[1:39:56.900 --> 1:40:03.620]  armed with the truth and research is it um is able to confront people that have you know
[1:40:03.620 --> 1:40:10.340]  know that they are credentialed to the system and you can go to them and you can say look like
[1:40:10.340 --> 1:40:15.700]  this contradicts what you're saying and if you know that truth then you can you know take down
[1:40:15.700 --> 1:40:21.780]  entire castles uh that are built on a foundation of lies well that's it proofs so powerful even
[1:40:21.780 --> 1:40:25.540]  though they suppress it it doesn't matter historically when they suppress it it's when it
[1:40:25.540 --> 1:40:31.700]  explodes that's right you know they they can only it's like a nuclear reaction and the reason why
[1:40:31.700 --> 1:40:38.740]  it's a nuclear reaction is because they're pushing back against this truth and they can only push back
[1:40:38.740 --> 1:40:46.260]  against it for so long and so hard until the truth builds up like a dam of water and the whole thing
[1:40:46.260 --> 1:40:52.660]  comes out you know and right now what we're seeing is we're seeing the cracks in that damn form
[1:40:53.380 --> 1:40:58.980]  and the dam is starting to break and so and they know it they're all running to emergency bunkers
[1:40:58.980 --> 1:41:04.180]  and air building airfields in the middle of nowhere i mean they're terrified they're terrified
[1:41:04.180 --> 1:41:08.820]  you know of the truth coming out uh they're terrified because all that money in power they
[1:41:08.820 --> 1:41:14.980]  want to screw little kids i mean yeah i mean that's that's that's part of the you know the
[1:41:14.980 --> 1:41:19.860]  subversion it's actually a really complicated subject of why that happens and i didn't want to
[1:41:19.860 --> 1:41:26.500]  believe it until uh but as a psychologist as one of my backgrounds i you know i i was like well if
[1:41:26.500 --> 1:41:30.820]  this exists and there's going to be a lot of people coming to a therapist and it turns out
[1:41:30.820 --> 1:41:36.420]  that there's this whole organization of of therapists that are treating uh satanic ritual
[1:41:36.420 --> 1:41:41.220]  abuse victims and it was like estimated there's like two million oh i personally have run into it
[1:41:41.220 --> 1:41:45.540]  i didn't believe this back 25 years ago when ted gunderson all these high-level fbi was telling me
[1:41:45.540 --> 1:41:50.900]  this and these are like really famous smart professional dudes and like cia vietnam veteran
[1:41:50.900 --> 1:41:54.660]  kernels and stuff and i thought these guys are crazy i'd be sitting around with these guys
[1:41:54.660 --> 1:41:58.980]  they were really alex you got exposed it's really real and now it's all true yeah people think i'm
[1:41:58.980 --> 1:42:03.860]  the guy that exposed all this no no no no this has been going on this has been burning very slowly
[1:42:03.860 --> 1:42:08.420]  and the fact that it's been covered up by the media means that they're they're in on it and the rest
[1:42:08.420 --> 1:42:13.140]  of the media that kind of doesn't talk about it is because they know that well they've seen what
[1:42:13.140 --> 1:42:17.620]  happens when people talked about it like in the 80s and the 90s they get their careers destroyed
[1:42:17.620 --> 1:42:22.260]  and they get slandered and then they end up in prison and you know people are scared to talk about
[1:42:22.260 --> 1:42:28.100]  this and so as a result of this like conspiracy of silence um that infects everybody else and
[1:42:28.100 --> 1:42:31.540]  that's how they get compromised yeah you want to hit something big though when we come back
[1:42:31.540 --> 1:42:35.860]  and tell us what's coming up briefly uh we're going to talk about how we got here with the left
[1:42:35.860 --> 1:42:38.980]  and we're going to be talking about cultural subversion and then we're going to be talking
[1:42:38.980 --> 1:42:44.580]  about tactical operations on how to take down the thought police this guy is smart cookie

[1:46:16.580 --> 1:46:19.940]  support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because
[1:46:19.940 --> 1:46:23.700]  they know how great they are and how wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere
[1:46:23.700 --> 1:46:30.500]  jones sells unapproved supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996
[1:46:30.500 --> 1:46:35.140]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no jurisdiction and
[1:46:35.140 --> 1:46:39.620]  won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are
[1:46:39.620 --> 1:46:43.460]  is the system trying to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things
[1:46:43.460 --> 1:46:47.380]  and a lot of drugs work great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma

[1:48:04.260 --> 1:48:11.060]  but first they're trying to intimidate us here's joe biden who can barely talk molesting a microphone
[1:48:11.060 --> 1:48:17.300]  creepily oh let's show you the pain hey we're awake now we we weren't under your control
[1:48:17.300 --> 1:48:24.100]  because we were intimidated we were asleep biden here it is he thinks he's being tough but like
[1:48:24.100 --> 1:48:31.620]  everything else he's always tough when he's not the guy getting hit he's always tough
[1:48:31.620 --> 1:48:39.700]  when someone else is feeling the pain and he's not and he's not we're gonna make him feel the pain
[1:48:41.460 --> 1:48:47.300]  what a creepy person oh yeah trump's not feeling any pain he's lost billions of dollars over a
[1:48:47.300 --> 1:48:50.980]  thousand lawsuits against him they're attacking his whole family they're trying to put him in
[1:48:50.980 --> 1:48:55.220]  prison trying to say he's a russian agent when they're the globalist i mean this is an amazing
[1:48:55.220 --> 1:49:00.820]  point uh zak for he's the biggest google whistleblower you say morse coming i want to get into this
[1:49:00.820 --> 1:49:04.340]  thing calls next hour but i want to get into your next big area where you want to expose how
[1:49:04.340 --> 1:49:09.380]  the manipulation takes place to a wider audience and really get people as you said the socratic
[1:49:09.380 --> 1:49:15.460]  method to look at it for themselves very exciting perspectives you have uh but specifically uh the
[1:49:15.460 --> 1:49:20.740]  attempt to bully the attempt to intimidate i i don't think i know we're gonna see a lot more
[1:49:20.740 --> 1:49:24.820]  whistleblowers come out i know that google's been really scared of that the new york times i had
[1:49:24.820 --> 1:49:31.460]  this new york times serpent part of this operation i talked to you one day in person here in austin
[1:49:31.460 --> 1:49:34.900]  and they came out of one of my court cases and when i said don't worry the leakers are coming
[1:49:34.900 --> 1:49:40.660]  humanity's awakening you won't stop america she started shaking i mean these people are literally
[1:49:40.660 --> 1:49:46.500]  like golem creatures from lord of the ranks yeah and they get triggered really easily and so the
[1:49:46.500 --> 1:49:52.740]  question is like why are there so many people that are in this state of mind and the answer to that
[1:49:52.740 --> 1:50:02.260]  is a process called ideological subversion which is a an agenda driven toolkit of mind control
[1:50:02.260 --> 1:50:08.980]  and the reason why we know a lot about this is because we had a kgb defector in the 80s by the
[1:50:08.980 --> 1:50:16.420]  name of yuri bezmanov who came and described and disclosed what the kgb were doing in order to
[1:50:16.420 --> 1:50:24.180]  uh flip a nation and turn them into uh soviet marxist leninism is what he described it's
[1:50:24.180 --> 1:50:28.740]  cultural marxism to sabotage the nation and people will say oh see it's a russian conspiracy no
[1:50:28.740 --> 1:50:36.340]  the u.s working with the british the foundations in 1917 took over russia and then psych psychologists
[1:50:36.340 --> 1:50:41.700]  and psychiatrists in europe and the u.s ran the attacks through the soviet and then
[1:50:41.700 --> 1:50:46.580]  reprojected the attack out of russia back at the west just like the globalist run china today and
[1:50:46.580 --> 1:50:52.340]  reproject the attack right and uh yuri bezmanov was responsible for that ideological subversion
[1:50:52.340 --> 1:50:57.140]  program in pakistan and he didn't actually understand what the repercussions of what
[1:50:57.140 --> 1:51:02.340]  he was doing were going to be but what ended up happening is that all his friends got murdered
[1:51:02.340 --> 1:51:07.300]  because uh not not his friends from russia but his friends in pakistan that he was talking to
[1:51:07.300 --> 1:51:11.860]  because he was he was collecting these intellectuals and reporting back to the soviets what they were
[1:51:11.860 --> 1:51:18.820]  doing and he all all got killed and so um he came out and defected to the united states in
[1:51:18.820 --> 1:51:25.780]  order to warn us that this was coming to the united states and so um if we can load up that first
[1:51:25.780 --> 1:51:31.700]  video at mark 120 what we're going to see is sort of the definition of what ideological subversion
[1:51:31.700 --> 1:51:38.980]  is at a high level here it is uh the soviets use the phrase ideological subversion what do they
[1:51:38.980 --> 1:51:48.660]  mean by ideological subversion is is the process which is legitimate all word and open you you
[1:51:48.660 --> 1:51:53.860]  can see it with your own eyes all all you have to do all american mass media has to do is to unplug
[1:51:53.860 --> 1:51:59.620]  their bananas from their ears open up their eyes and they can see it there is no mystery there's
[1:51:59.620 --> 1:52:05.620]  nothing to do with espionage i know that espionage intelligence gathering looks more romantic it sells
[1:52:05.620 --> 1:52:11.620]  more deodorants through the advertising probably that's why your hollywood producers are so crazy
[1:52:11.620 --> 1:52:20.260]  about james bonn type of thrillers but in reality the main emphasis of the kgb is not in the area
[1:52:20.260 --> 1:52:27.300]  of intelligence at all it's info according to my opinion and opinion of many defectors of my caliber
[1:52:27.300 --> 1:52:35.540]  only about 15 percent of time money and manpower is spent on espionage as such the other 85 percent
[1:52:35.540 --> 1:52:44.100]  is a slow process which we call either ideological subversion or active measures actively in the
[1:52:44.100 --> 1:52:50.820]  language of the kgb or psychological warfare what it basically means is to change the perception of
[1:52:50.820 --> 1:52:58.340]  reality of every american to such an extent that despite of the abundance of information
[1:52:59.460 --> 1:53:06.100]  no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of defending themselves their
[1:53:06.100 --> 1:53:14.660]  families their community and their country it's a great brainwashing process which goes very slow
[1:53:14.660 --> 1:53:22.660]  and it's divided in four basic stages the first one being demoralization it takes from 15 to 20
[1:53:22.660 --> 1:53:28.820]  years to demoralize a nation why that many years because this is the minimum number of years which
[1:53:28.820 --> 1:53:38.420]  requires to educate one generation of students in the country of your enemy exposed to the ideology
[1:53:38.420 --> 1:53:44.900]  of the enemy in other words marxism leninism ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of
[1:53:44.900 --> 1:53:49.860]  at least three generations of american students without being challenged or counterbalanced by
[1:53:49.860 --> 1:53:58.180]  the basic values of america the demoralization process in united states is basically completed
[1:53:58.180 --> 1:54:05.780]  already uh for the last 25 years actually it's over fulfilled because demoralization now reaches
[1:54:05.780 --> 1:54:11.860]  such areas where previously not even comrade and drop off and can't shake strong when experts would
[1:54:11.860 --> 1:54:19.140]  yeah would even dream of such a tremendous success oh yeah most of it is done by americans to americans
[1:54:19.140 --> 1:54:26.020]  thanks to lack of moral standards as i mentioned before uh exposure to true information does not
[1:54:26.020 --> 1:54:33.220]  matter anymore a person who was demoralized is unable to assess true information and that's
[1:54:33.220 --> 1:54:39.940]  an example tell nothing to him uh even if i show him with information with with authentic
[1:54:39.940 --> 1:54:46.260]  proof with documents with pictures even if i take him by force to the soviet union and show him
[1:54:46.260 --> 1:54:53.380]  concentration camp he will refuse to believe it until he he's going to receive a kick in the in
[1:54:53.380 --> 1:55:00.100]  his fat bottom when a military boot crashes he's then he will understand but not before that that's
[1:55:00.100 --> 1:55:05.060]  the tragic of the situation of demoralization and then it'll be too late yeah so so it's really
[1:55:05.060 --> 1:55:09.700]  important to if we can just pause it right here is that um a lot of people are like well i was there
[1:55:09.700 --> 1:55:14.100]  and then on access tv 25 years ago were you yeah it's great bragging it's just i haven't played
[1:55:14.100 --> 1:55:17.780]  that in years i'm glad you mentioned it there's so many there's so much but it's dead on and then
[1:55:17.780 --> 1:55:22.580]  once you started it keeps rolling but it didn't come out of russia the infection was sent because
[1:55:22.580 --> 1:55:27.780]  the globals had a dictatorship once they took the czars out to do it in russia they did it in china
[1:55:27.780 --> 1:55:32.100]  as well and they redirected back at us right and so people are like well who are they right and
[1:55:32.100 --> 1:55:37.540]  specifically if you want to research this yourself um i want to ask a question to the audience who is
[1:55:37.540 --> 1:55:46.260]  the tavastok uh institute and what did they have to do with the beetles and when you look at like
[1:55:46.260 --> 1:55:52.420]  their involvement what you'll see is that a lot of these what we thought were organic cultural
[1:55:52.420 --> 1:55:58.180]  movements were actually designed by social engineers to capture the youth of america and
[1:55:58.180 --> 1:56:03.780]  what they had was a long multi-generational plan to change the perception of reality
[1:56:03.780 --> 1:56:08.260]  for the citizens of america and that's all declassified this is all declassified it's not an
[1:56:08.260 --> 1:56:14.260]  opinion and it's not even supposed to the music is it's what the beetles say politically and of
[1:56:14.260 --> 1:56:18.100]  course you know john lennon revolted against that and at the end we had the letters from
[1:56:18.100 --> 1:56:22.580]  senator strong firm and saying kill this son of a bitch and they did they did they got rid of them
[1:56:22.580 --> 1:56:29.860]  and a lot of the cultural um heroes that we have end up dying uh you know before their time and uh
[1:56:29.860 --> 1:56:36.980]  bob marley was one of them you know uh john lennon and if you know anyone who breaks free comes
[1:56:36.980 --> 1:56:42.340]  under danger like look at yee like he went you know off off script and started you know
[1:56:42.980 --> 1:56:47.140]  supporting dollon trump and trying to wake up the masses saying the whole system is lying
[1:56:47.140 --> 1:56:50.580]  they try to put him in a mental institution yeah and all of a sudden he's he's like oh he's in a
[1:56:50.580 --> 1:56:54.900]  mental institution that's that's all you heard about it and then you look in to you know what he
[1:56:54.900 --> 1:56:59.220]  was really saying and you're like oh no he wasn't he wasn't crazy he was just going off script and
[1:56:59.220 --> 1:57:03.940]  going against the manufactured narrative that's being pumped into the minds of americans and
[1:57:03.940 --> 1:57:08.900]  it scared him so much we had to play a little minute intro promo when we come back and and so i
[1:57:08.900 --> 1:57:12.900]  want to open the phones up these callers are another subject it's all the same subject divide
[1:57:12.900 --> 1:57:17.460]  and conquer and uh toxic cultures will take those calls from ryan and ronnie they will open the phones
[1:57:17.460 --> 1:57:26.100]  up again specifically uh to talk to zack forhees uh and get into uh your questions for the the most
[1:57:26.100 --> 1:57:30.660]  important move a whistleblower certainly the most courage and the most prolific and uh they're they're
[1:57:30.660 --> 1:57:35.220]  trying to not respond to it uh when i heard he was going on fox today i thought man they're somebody's
[1:57:35.220 --> 1:57:40.260]  gonna kill that the higher levels and so far they rescheduled it so we want to have this break out
[1:57:40.260 --> 1:57:43.060]  only you can make sure it gets out there so spread the live lines
[1:57:45.380 --> 1:57:52.020]  thomas jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future
[1:57:52.020 --> 1:57:57.060]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality who actually work for a living
[1:57:57.060 --> 1:58:01.780]  that would end up saving the nation and today the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming
[1:58:01.780 --> 1:58:07.940]  goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's
[1:58:07.940 --> 1:58:14.020]  doing in this trade war once china put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't
[1:58:14.020 --> 1:58:19.380]  going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down so to the walking cruises and the hillary
[1:58:19.380 --> 1:58:23.380]  clinton's the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never
[1:58:23.380 --> 1:58:27.940]  going to give up and all you've done is a wake of the human spirit and the human spirit lives
[1:58:27.940 --> 1:58:33.540]  at info wars dot com and news wars dot com and i'm asking listeners whatever you do spread those
[1:58:33.540 --> 1:58:40.020]  links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[1:58:47.460 --> 1:58:52.820]  what you have witnessed is the biggest development in free speech in the western
[1:58:52.820 --> 1:59:01.860]  worlds history this is a digital ai enforced gag order not to say the name alex jones
[1:59:01.860 --> 1:59:12.900]  our info wars dot com this is nazi germany level this is racketeering this is cartels mr
[1:59:12.900 --> 1:59:20.980]  president we need your help we need it now you can take on big tech they saw info wars as a dominant
[1:59:20.980 --> 1:59:28.180]  independent anti-war pro-human pro-sovereign pro-family populist organization so they thought
[1:59:28.180 --> 1:59:34.500]  first they come for alex jones then when people say okay take him off the air everyone else like
[1:59:34.500 --> 1:59:39.940]  dominoes would fall the way to fight back is to support info wars now more than ever and make it a

[1:59:58.660 --> 2:00:07.060]  other people's opinions we are controlled by the media today it all changes this reality has been
[2:00:07.060 --> 2:00:12.500]  forced upon us it is a choice just like when i said slavery is a choice istein says the
[2:00:12.500 --> 2:00:17.620]  depth of insanity is doing the same thing expecting a different result so we keep on saying i hate you
[2:00:17.620 --> 2:00:22.820]  i hate you you you you how are we gonna get a different result out of hate why don't we just

[2:00:30.740 --> 2:00:36.740]  you need some crazy mother to change something steve jobs is crazy now we all know Steve jobs
[2:00:36.740 --> 2:00:42.900]  falls they say truck spray they say i'm crazy but i'm here to show love it's a bigger plan and i'm
[2:00:42.900 --> 2:00:52.980]  just doing what the universe told me resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[2:00:52.980 --> 2:00:56.420]  all right box days and we pop it in for two segments next and then we're going to take
[2:00:56.420 --> 2:01:01.300]  your phone calls i'm going to finish it with two callers that have been holding ryan and ronnie
[2:01:01.300 --> 2:01:06.500]  zach vorhees of the big google whistleblower the biggest data dump the ed snowden but other google
[2:01:06.500 --> 2:01:12.740]  folks are calling him a big tech but you were just asking me i thought about telling the story i never
[2:01:12.740 --> 2:01:18.980]  told it uh if i've ever had connie west on the show you know i know he's a listener i've talked
[2:01:18.980 --> 2:01:24.820]  to folks in his his entourage and all that and we were talking like a year ago more than a year ago
[2:01:24.820 --> 2:01:29.460]  to his security people and they were like well does jones have guns on top of buildings and all
[2:01:29.460 --> 2:01:34.260]  this stuff where i've joked around about that and you know black helicopters and stuff and and like
[2:01:34.260 --> 2:01:38.260]  the producer goes oh yeah you know our our our security can beat up your security they actually
[2:01:38.260 --> 2:01:42.180]  took it serious i guess that's south side chicago so it's just but obviously his security already
[2:01:42.180 --> 2:01:47.220]  didn't want him to come on the show but but here's the thing my audience built the trump platform
[2:01:47.220 --> 2:01:52.820]  for him to launch on so see we're not trying to get into the system we built the whole new launch
[2:01:52.820 --> 2:01:57.460]  and a lot of others did as well so i like being the guy in the wilderness i don't even care if
[2:01:57.460 --> 2:02:01.140]  it's about like connie west comes on the show he already has courage he's already doing a great job
[2:02:01.140 --> 2:02:06.340]  i get all these calls and we talked to all these really high-powered big famous people they go oh i
[2:02:06.340 --> 2:02:10.580]  listen to the show all the time i love the show but i'm scared to come on and but please don't
[2:02:10.580 --> 2:02:15.060]  tell people i was just listening yesterday that's fine it's okay because we see what you're doing
[2:02:15.060 --> 2:02:18.820]  in testimony to congress we see what you're doing when you get the chance out there on the national
[2:02:18.820 --> 2:02:23.940]  news we see what all these good folks like you know kurt russell and everybody else are you know
[2:02:23.940 --> 2:02:28.660]  saying when they get a chance to go on tv so it's all there you need to come on the show you just go
[2:02:28.660 --> 2:02:32.340]  out and say it in the world and we all know what's going on it's not about getting the credit it's
[2:02:32.340 --> 2:02:37.540]  about beating these humanizers yeah that's right that's right you know and so um hopefully connie
[2:02:37.540 --> 2:02:42.180]  will come on your show one day because um he needs to talk to the people and you know tell your
[2:02:42.180 --> 2:02:49.060]  audience like why he did what he did and why he decided to break from um the the script and tell
[2:02:49.060 --> 2:02:54.020]  the truth well everybody knew trump was super nice and we had a lot of great opportunities with black
[2:02:54.020 --> 2:02:59.140]  folks and was always very very you know nice and opened up golf courses 45 years ago and
[2:02:59.140 --> 2:03:03.460]  they were only white and all the rest of it everybody knows that so the black rappers and
[2:03:03.460 --> 2:03:08.820]  stuff really feel guilty that they've been crapping on trump like like uh snoop dog says
[2:03:08.820 --> 2:03:13.300]  trumps the greatest guy ever now trumps the nazi and and so it's just connie that isn't a coward
[2:03:13.300 --> 2:03:17.780]  yeah that's right so we thank connie for uh telling the truth and he's already done what he needs to
[2:03:17.780 --> 2:03:23.220]  do it you know exactly should we take some calls we're gonna do it but i went too long so we got
[2:03:23.220 --> 2:03:28.020]  vox day coming up and i promise ryan and ronnie first when we come back uh tell us some of the
[2:03:28.020 --> 2:03:33.140]  topics the reason you wanted to get vox day on so the reason i want to get vox days because first
[2:03:33.140 --> 2:03:38.020]  i want to tell the audience about ideological subversion and how they create these sjw's and
[2:03:38.020 --> 2:03:42.980]  then i want to talk about the tactics of taking down the thought police and so the author of that

[2:06:32.500 --> 2:06:37.860]  ladies and gentlemen we're back live broadcasting worldwide for the info wars news center in austin
[2:06:37.860 --> 2:06:43.220]  texas in defiance of the globalist attempt to shut us down remember you're the road the bridge
[2:06:43.220 --> 2:06:48.100]  on which this bus is traveling on you're the air in which this bird flies without you supporting
[2:06:48.100 --> 2:06:53.140]  us we are not here you are the info war this is what you built you're seeing the giant results of
[2:06:53.140 --> 2:06:58.260]  the human desire for liberty and common sense box says with us for two segments i want him to
[2:06:58.260 --> 2:07:02.180]  pop in because you were talking about his book helping really wake you up we were selling it
[2:07:02.180 --> 2:07:05.140]  we weren't again i don't know why we saw it as something we never reorder it we take it down
[2:07:05.140 --> 2:07:10.980]  but but we've reordered it'll be here in a week so get it info wars store.com sjw is always lie
[2:07:10.980 --> 2:07:18.740]  and sjw is always double down put that lower third up again infowarstore.com today and that funds our
[2:07:18.740 --> 2:07:24.100]  operation so thank you all so let's we got two segments here and then box has got to go let's
[2:07:24.100 --> 2:07:29.220]  get into the seminal book and why you think it's so important uh the reason why it's important is
[2:07:29.220 --> 2:07:34.180]  because if you don't understand how the left operates and has been indoctrinated in order to
[2:07:34.180 --> 2:07:39.060]  achieve uh cultural change then what's going to happen is that you're going to make a mistake and
[2:07:39.940 --> 2:07:44.660]  i'll give you an example a lot of people think that they have to apologize and that if they
[2:07:44.660 --> 2:07:49.540]  apologize and they do an atonement that the problem is going to go away and what they get
[2:07:49.540 --> 2:07:53.540]  that's really empowering the jellyfish it is because what they're looking for is that they're
[2:07:53.540 --> 2:07:59.940]  actually looking for your apology as a tactic so that they can parade the apology around and say
[2:07:59.940 --> 2:08:04.020]  look this person admits that they're a bad person and then what they're going to do is they're going
[2:08:04.020 --> 2:08:09.860]  to use it to slime you and destroy you and this happens over and over and over again and so
[2:08:09.860 --> 2:08:16.500]  one of the most important lessons that i learned from sjw's always lie is never apologize to the
[2:08:16.500 --> 2:08:21.300]  left because they're not going to let you go there it's just a tactic that they're going to use in
[2:08:21.300 --> 2:08:32.020]  order to uh hurt you um and um you know and and so yeah like you know vox is here today and uh
[2:08:32.020 --> 2:08:38.100]  you know he's better at telling his book than than i am so um and again he's writing a playbook
[2:08:38.100 --> 2:08:44.020]  about their playbook they admit all of this in their rules for radicals pledge to lucifer i mean
[2:08:44.020 --> 2:08:48.500]  in the these are cold-blooded manipulators and all the studies show it that the biggest thing
[2:08:48.500 --> 2:08:53.220]  i ever woke up to was like 10 years ago that even low-level liberals know they're evil know it's a
[2:08:53.220 --> 2:08:59.140]  scam and know they're just seeking power and trying to punch our buttons so vox oh i want to add to
[2:08:59.140 --> 2:09:04.020]  that uh you said that like they they pledged to lucifer and people will not believe you but if
[2:09:04.020 --> 2:09:11.220]  you want to verify what alex jones is saying go and download sol linsky's rules for for radicals
[2:09:11.220 --> 2:09:17.220]  and look at who he dedicated the book to and you'll see that what alex jones is saying is 100
[2:09:17.220 --> 2:09:22.980]  percent true and then here's a question for the audience which presidential candidates recently
[2:09:22.980 --> 2:09:28.820]  uh that's been recently in the last three years um did their dissertation thesis on
[2:09:28.820 --> 2:09:35.780]  sol alinsky tactics hillary okay they're needing puzzle solve yeah it was hillary so she she she
[2:09:35.780 --> 2:09:40.500]  did her oh wait sorry that's a socratic method that's a socratic method but that's okay it's
[2:09:40.500 --> 2:09:45.060]  yeah so it's hillary oh it's we don't do breadcrumbs here we just go right to the end yeah but i mean
[2:09:45.060 --> 2:09:49.060]  but you're right people want to follow the breadcrumbs hey vox thanks for popping in with this
[2:09:49.060 --> 2:09:52.020]  big plug for your book wherever people get it they should get it it's the best seller but
[2:09:52.020 --> 2:09:56.260]  we sell it in foreshore dot com but it has worked a lot of folks up they do always lie
[2:09:56.260 --> 2:10:03.540]  why do they always lie because the truth is anathema to them and you know i'd like to first
[2:10:03.540 --> 2:10:10.500]  of all say uh thanks to zack for writing what is probably the most powerful book review i've
[2:10:10.500 --> 2:10:17.220]  ever seen of any of my nonfiction um it's it's very inspiring to see that that people are taking
[2:10:17.220 --> 2:10:23.780]  what was written as a work of philosophy and turning it into a tactical operation manual
[2:10:23.780 --> 2:10:30.740]  that's really encouraging a lot of people don't realize but for a period of about two years uh
[2:10:30.740 --> 2:10:36.340]  sjw's always lie was actually the best-selling political philosophy book on amazon ahead of
[2:10:36.340 --> 2:10:42.580]  macchiavelli ahead of playdough ahead of iris doddle and so forth and the the thing is that
[2:10:42.580 --> 2:10:49.780]  that the more philosophically true your actions are the more dedicated to the truth that you are
[2:10:50.260 --> 2:10:55.860]  the more effective that your actions are going to be and so yeah this was back uh back when
[2:10:55.860 --> 2:11:01.300]  sjw's always double down came out and it was interesting to see how uh the the top three
[2:11:01.300 --> 2:11:06.420]  best sellers in political philosophy ahead of playtoe ahead of uh you know all the famous
[2:11:06.420 --> 2:11:15.780]  John Locke and Hobbs and so forth were Stefan Mullen you and i but the what zack did was exactly
[2:11:15.780 --> 2:11:24.820]  right he he waited he gathered information he did his research and then he took his shot at the
[2:11:24.820 --> 2:11:33.140]  appropriate time and that is what terrifies google that's what terrifies the the various converge
[2:11:33.140 --> 2:11:40.580]  corporations is that there are literally hundreds if not thousands of people like zack
[2:11:41.380 --> 2:11:46.180]  inside their operations you know a couple years ago or two years ago i think google
[2:11:46.180 --> 2:11:53.700]  canceled a company-wide meeting because they didn't want me publishing their uh notes from the meeting
[2:11:54.660 --> 2:11:59.620]  on my blog they knew that i have i mean they know that i have a line directly into their
[2:11:59.620 --> 2:12:06.980]  communication system but you know it's not zack there's like i said there's dozens of
[2:12:06.980 --> 2:12:13.460]  googlers who do not appreciate what google is trying to do and there's a lot more every day
[2:12:13.460 --> 2:12:23.540]  yes exactly so so vox we're gonna get more next segment into the book itself but expanding on this
[2:12:23.540 --> 2:12:28.340]  just as solo lens keys will for radicals and technical manual years is just to understand
[2:12:28.340 --> 2:12:32.820]  the their mindset and just how nasty they are so we don't project humanity onto them because we
[2:12:32.820 --> 2:12:37.780]  have humanity we need to realize just how nasty and and and and bottomless these people are but
[2:12:37.780 --> 2:12:42.820]  specifically what are you expecting just politically at this point to happen soon because
[2:12:42.820 --> 2:12:48.340]  things are getting crazy they're getting crazier and crazier i mean this this thing is boiling over
[2:12:48.340 --> 2:12:55.060]  well i think that the economic crash is coming soon i think that we're looking at another situation
[2:12:55.060 --> 2:13:00.500]  i think that we're basically in late 2007 and that uh and that's the establishments counter to
[2:13:00.500 --> 2:13:05.860]  nationalism you think is this no i don't think it's actually an intentional counter i think that the
[2:13:05.860 --> 2:13:12.900]  system is is creaking i mean when you've got interest rates actually going up and down and
[2:13:12.900 --> 2:13:21.380]  is is creaking i mean when you've got interest rates actually going negative in germany and in
[2:13:21.380 --> 2:13:26.020]  other european countries you've got i understand that but trump's trying to prop it up and and
[2:13:26.020 --> 2:13:30.740]  people like bill marr in the left are openly in the former at federal reserve heads are running
[2:13:30.740 --> 2:13:35.060]  around screaming the sky's falling i agree the system all the world screwed up in a bubble
[2:13:35.060 --> 2:13:38.340]  but i mean do we really want to pop it now because they want to blame it on trump
[2:13:38.340 --> 2:13:45.140]  well yes but the thing is it's going to it's going to pop while trump is president because
[2:13:45.140 --> 2:13:51.460]  trump is going to win in 2020 and there's no way that the i agree with you so how far can we kick
[2:13:51.460 --> 2:13:59.140]  it but we want to kick it past 2020 so we get trumpet in right i don't think it matters i think
[2:13:59.140 --> 2:14:06.660]  that you know i've heard correctly predicted that trump is going to win in 2016 uh in fairly early
[2:14:06.660 --> 2:14:14.580]  2015 um i said right after the election you know we actually put up trump's slide 2020 shirts uh the
[2:14:14.580 --> 2:14:19.220]  day after the election not because we were just trying to you know improve morale or anything
[2:14:19.220 --> 2:14:25.620]  but because i was convinced that the democrats simply don't have anyone who can even begin
[2:14:25.620 --> 2:14:30.020]  to compete with the man we have the same analysis so so so then looking forward in 2020
[2:14:30.020 --> 2:14:36.660]  how do you see that the cards falling well i think that trump is going to regardless of
[2:14:36.660 --> 2:14:46.820]  whether there is a uh economic crisis or not trump is going to win uh in 2020 and by a bigger margin
[2:14:46.820 --> 2:14:52.500]  than he did in 2016 and that's really to bring it back to the google situation you know that's
[2:14:52.500 --> 2:14:58.020]  where i actually discovered what was going on in google because there were uh you know they were
[2:14:58.020 --> 2:15:03.540]  running around demanding and and i'm sure that can testify to this there were googleers running
[2:15:03.540 --> 2:15:08.340]  around demanding that anyone who voted for trump should be disemployed oh that came out of the
[2:15:08.340 --> 2:15:15.940]  news should be um talk about a cult like you can't work here if you're a republican yeah i mean well

[2:19:03.060 --> 2:19:07.780]  close to reality who actually work for a living that would end up saving the nation and today the
[2:19:07.780 --> 2:19:14.100]  communist chinese have banned all us farming goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in
[2:19:14.100 --> 2:19:19.700]  polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war once china put pressure on
[2:19:19.700 --> 2:19:25.300]  our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down
[2:19:25.300 --> 2:19:30.340]  so to the walking cruises and the hillary clinton's the world that want to intimidate people and tell
[2:19:30.340 --> 2:19:35.140]  us to back down we're never going to give up and all you've done is awaken the human spirit
[2:19:35.140 --> 2:19:41.380]  and the human spirit lives at info wars.com and news wars.com and i'm asking listeners whatever
[2:19:41.380 --> 2:19:46.260]  you do spread those links because we are the light the dark of the night we are the resistance
[2:19:46.260 --> 2:20:11.540]  we are 1776 worldwide you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:16.340 --> 2:20:26.660]  listen i could do 10 hours with both these guys we got loaded phones and great questions but i'd
[2:20:26.660 --> 2:20:30.580]  like to invite you back on as a regular guest i know you showed some interest in wanting to do
[2:20:30.580 --> 2:20:34.420]  your own show absolutely you're made for talk radio really smart guy you get all the different
[2:20:34.420 --> 2:20:38.740]  angles of trying to get people to see how they're being manipulated from different perspectives so
[2:20:39.620 --> 2:20:43.860]  me and vox talked about vox and i talked about him doing a show we never got around to it maybe you
[2:20:43.860 --> 2:20:47.460]  guys should do a show together it's just that i've been busier and a one-legged man in an ass
[2:20:47.460 --> 2:20:52.340]  kicking contest and so all these projects i want to launch haven't happened the last few years because
[2:20:52.340 --> 2:20:57.540]  i've had 30 plus lawsuits and you wouldn't hear in the news i've gotten 20 plus thrown out and it's
[2:20:57.540 --> 2:21:02.900]  cost you $5 million or whatever but we're winning thanks to you but it's been one hell of a fight
[2:21:02.900 --> 2:21:08.740]  so please remember infowarstore.com for all of your great nucleosauticals books t-shirts films
[2:21:08.740 --> 2:21:12.980]  you name it vox day is our guest and we've got him for one more segment and we're going to take
[2:21:12.980 --> 2:21:19.780]  phone calls after that for our guest here in studio zack vorhees but but finishing up vox
[2:21:20.340 --> 2:21:25.620]  why your book so important how it's woken up so many i would say who are classical liberals
[2:21:25.620 --> 2:21:30.260]  like zack to really see the cult programming and make them have a hard break with it because like
[2:21:30.260 --> 2:21:34.180]  you said you were already having big questions before you read his book you were already trying
[2:21:34.180 --> 2:21:39.860]  to figure out what was going on but it really showed you the type of mental political affliction
[2:21:39.860 --> 2:21:45.540]  that has been basically engineered into this to the minion class yeah and i want to get to
[2:21:45.540 --> 2:21:49.940]  right of the heart of this so vox if you'll allow me to talk about your book and we'll do another
[2:21:49.940 --> 2:21:54.260]  segment we have to but i swore to go to calls keep going all right so um there are eight main
[2:21:54.260 --> 2:21:58.500]  points in his book and what i'm going to do is talk about them so uh number one recognize the
[2:21:58.500 --> 2:22:02.660]  attack remain calm and realize that very few friends and co-workers will help you okay you're
[2:22:02.660 --> 2:22:07.780]  kind of in this fight for for yourself um second of all is don't try to reason with them you are
[2:22:07.780 --> 2:22:12.020]  not dealing with rational people but with raving beasts who will take every gesture of goodwill
[2:22:12.020 --> 2:22:18.020]  as a sign of weakness and will use everything they say you say against them okay against you
[2:22:18.020 --> 2:22:23.060]  um one of the ways i defend against this is that whenever they want to talk to me in private
[2:22:23.060 --> 2:22:27.460]  i always say i'm going to record this conversation so that we have a clear record of what's being
[2:22:27.460 --> 2:22:33.780]  said guess what it doesn't matter how powerful they are they are scared to death of the cameras and
[2:22:33.780 --> 2:22:37.860]  them being exactly what i do when the fake reporters are here but even in our meetings and
[2:22:37.860 --> 2:22:42.740]  stuff you know because i want stuff on record of what i said yeah exactly so do not apologize
[2:22:42.740 --> 2:22:48.660]  as number three okay apologies are treated as evidence of guilt and invite intensified attacks
[2:22:48.660 --> 2:22:52.660]  okay this is something that's not intuitive it's something that you have to realize oh i wish i'd
[2:22:52.660 --> 2:22:59.140]  have read his book but when i was like they'd say stop saying uh that uh harass sandhook families
[2:22:59.140 --> 2:23:03.620]  and i said i never did that but if anybody is trying to do that my name don't do it i apologize
[2:23:03.620 --> 2:23:08.340]  that's when all hell broke that's when it was the beginning of that whole s**t storm that happened to
[2:23:08.340 --> 2:23:14.820]  you um okay so number four is accept your fate try to adopt a stoic attitude of indifference about
[2:23:14.820 --> 2:23:19.460]  outcomes focus simply on doing the right thing which is to fight okay i gotta say this sounds
[2:23:19.460 --> 2:23:23.620]  like my um um manual just how to be a man that's what i've done politically and that's how you're
[2:23:23.620 --> 2:23:29.060]  successful exactly this is the reason why it's a philosophy book okay so um document they're
[2:23:29.060 --> 2:23:34.660]  every word in action so you know for what i did is i i wanted to record them that's that's terrifying
[2:23:34.660 --> 2:23:40.580]  to them um do not resign and don't do so don't do the enemies work for them because if you're
[2:23:40.580 --> 2:23:44.820]  resigned then they're going to parade that out around as a surrender and that you admitted to
[2:23:44.820 --> 2:23:50.180]  being what they accused you of yeah don't quit make them fire you fight fight fight all right
[2:23:50.180 --> 2:23:58.340]  this number seven is the most important okay make the rubble bounce basically this means
[2:23:58.340 --> 2:24:03.780]  a counter attack do everything you can to raise the price of attacking you for your enemies and
[2:24:03.780 --> 2:24:08.020]  your employer this is worth quoting at length that's what i did with pepper the frog they spent a
[2:24:08.020 --> 2:24:13.220]  million and a half and they got 15 thousand dollars that the judge ordered us to settle basically
[2:24:13.220 --> 2:24:17.540]  and it was a it was a massive defeat for them exactly so you want to send a hundred thousand
[2:24:17.540 --> 2:24:21.860]  you want to target the enemy at every opportunity hit them wherever they show themselves vulnerable
[2:24:21.860 --> 2:24:25.940]  play as dirty as your conscience will permit undermine them sabotage them and discredit them
[2:24:25.940 --> 2:24:32.420]  now i didn't like i wasn't malicious to google before i left other than doxing them but um i'll
[2:24:32.420 --> 2:24:36.020]  say this i'm gonna ask voxus we'll do one more segment i know he's got to go to but he's he's
[2:24:36.020 --> 2:24:41.060]  off or stay but i gotta go to the calls vox i wouldn't use that term fight dirty i mean i know
[2:24:41.060 --> 2:24:44.340]  everybody knows what that means kind of underhanded if somebody started the fight and you're kicking
[2:24:44.340 --> 2:24:50.820]  your ass it's not dirty to punch him in the in the uh you know testicles people would call that dirty
[2:24:50.820 --> 2:24:55.380]  in a boxing match because that's a you know square fight so but but i'm still kind of worried when
[2:24:55.380 --> 2:25:00.020]  when we say dirty because i found dirty stuff can bounce back on you what do you mean by dirty
[2:25:01.780 --> 2:25:08.740]  i mean whatever you use whatever works i'm a trained martial artist we don't worry about what
[2:25:08.740 --> 2:25:16.420]  the marcus of queensbury rules are if someone comes at you any tactic that they use against you
[2:25:16.420 --> 2:25:21.460]  is legitimately adopted and used against oh i totally agree but nothing's dirty when you're
[2:25:21.460 --> 2:25:26.820]  fighting for your life and you didn't initiate so i just think what's a better word what uh fair
[2:25:26.820 --> 2:25:32.340]  game first blood i don't i don't i don't worry i don't worry about those things the point that
[2:25:32.340 --> 2:25:41.060]  the reason that i said fight dirty is because people are i'm trying to teach people to stop
[2:25:41.060 --> 2:25:46.260]  thinking about it in terms of what they think is fair it's not about what you think is fair
[2:25:46.260 --> 2:25:50.100]  it's about the situation it's about what you know i totally agree with that and i wasn't trying to
[2:25:50.100 --> 2:25:55.380]  split hairs here and then i want to add to that because this goes right into his i could do a lot
[2:25:55.380 --> 2:26:01.460]  of dirty stuff and f some globalist over i just don't do it because it's it's not chivalrous and
[2:26:01.460 --> 2:26:05.940]  i found that gives me some form of protection but but so i'm and i'm not saying you're immoral
[2:26:05.940 --> 2:26:09.940]  saying fight dirty i think you're redefining for conservatives that tend to be very squeamish
[2:26:09.940 --> 2:26:14.660]  that hey you're fighting for your life you need to start you know kicking ass no but but conservatives
[2:26:14.660 --> 2:26:20.020]  are wrong conservatives are weak there's a reason why they call me dark lord it's because we've
[2:26:20.020 --> 2:26:25.380]  do whatever we need to do right and a lot of people let's expand it's not necessarily wrong
[2:26:25.380 --> 2:26:29.220]  it's just people like oh that wouldn't be a nice thing to do okay but i didn't know you had the
[2:26:29.220 --> 2:26:32.900]  nickname dark lord but you wrote a good you're a good guy and i like having you on so explain to
[2:26:32.900 --> 2:26:39.940]  me about the dark lord philosophy in justifies the means no it's not that the end justifies
[2:26:39.940 --> 2:26:47.220]  means it's that you play by the rules of the game that you are are provided that i totally agree with
[2:26:47.220 --> 2:26:51.380]  and so i don't think it's called fighting dirty that's all i'm saying they will call it fighting
[2:26:51.380 --> 2:26:56.100]  dirty you don't it doesn't matter what they say i don't pay any attention to what the left says no
[2:26:56.100 --> 2:27:00.900]  no i get it now so you're you're you're invoking terms like that on purpose to get people to stop
[2:27:00.900 --> 2:27:08.740]  being so squeamish exactly and and in number eight what he says here is um don't act out of anger
[2:27:08.740 --> 2:27:14.660]  don't initiate attacks but when attack respond with disproportionate overwhelming force that's
[2:27:14.660 --> 2:27:20.180]  what trump does that's what trump does and that's what i did you know i i react to whatever's
[2:27:20.180 --> 2:27:24.500]  google is going to do and as a result they think twice about what they're going to do to me
[2:27:25.060 --> 2:27:31.380]  and so um that is one of the most important points in this whole tactical operation
[2:27:31.380 --> 2:27:36.100]  is to respond with disproportionate overwhelming force at every opportunity well that's always
[2:27:36.100 --> 2:27:42.660]  what you gotta do that's what you always got to do if they escalate you they have to understand
[2:27:42.660 --> 2:27:48.020]  that you're going to escalate with them you know people often say how come you don't
[2:27:48.020 --> 2:27:54.260]  lead with your best shot how come you don't show your hand and the reason is because if you
[2:27:54.820 --> 2:28:01.460]  lead with your best shot then you've got nowhere to go you've got no potential for escalation
[2:28:01.460 --> 2:28:07.700]  and so the best way to prevent things from going you know nuclear on both sides is to
[2:28:07.700 --> 2:28:14.980]  to uh just continue to maintain something in reserve and oh sure you never go nuclear
[2:28:14.980 --> 2:28:18.740]  or force i mean you don't want to go nuclear up front because that was causing nuclear war
[2:28:18.740 --> 2:28:24.420]  using a i mean actual military uh theater type situation you'd want to use a lot of other things
[2:28:24.420 --> 2:28:32.100]  first exactly but really kind of every drop nuclear weapons atomic weapons on people and
[2:28:32.100 --> 2:28:39.780]  japan found out it's like you uh show the wind you reap the whirlwind and i'm so
[2:28:39.780 --> 2:28:43.060]  sad for those japanese folks following their emperor but they found out what happened and now

[2:34:44.420 --> 2:34:48.020]  the globalists think if they can shut m4s down they can shut anything down and the fact that we're
[2:34:48.020 --> 2:34:52.900]  still here you can watch senator hearings for senator bloominthal and others are shaking with
[2:34:52.900 --> 2:34:59.220]  hate and fear saying we want him shut up he's not been shut down he's more influential than ever and

[2:35:06.020 --> 2:35:11.780]  and they know they've sold their soul they know that they have are not following that path of
[2:35:11.780 --> 2:35:16.980]  empathy that christ talked about but real empathy means being strong and fighting tyrants so we

[2:35:22.020 --> 2:35:27.060]  slash show the lot say alex jones is still on he's still there and it's happening it's actually
[2:35:27.060 --> 2:35:32.660]  gone from crushing us down making a stronger to now some magic things are happening i've been
[2:35:32.660 --> 2:35:36.900]  advised by people that i don't really get a lot of advice but they go jones don't tell people you're
[2:35:36.900 --> 2:35:41.620]  getting stronger don't don't it's not even financial it because that's the problem area but influence
[2:35:41.620 --> 2:35:47.060]  wise and and and what we're saying who's listening i mean do you think that doesn't make powerful world
[2:35:47.060 --> 2:35:53.380]  leaders and major thought leaders when they hear don't listen to alex jones tune in the fact that
[2:35:53.380 --> 2:35:58.260]  we're still here we're not supposed to be here folks they're supposed to shut us down then lie
[2:35:58.260 --> 2:36:02.340]  about us so that we're not on air so they can then build a straw man but we're still here
[2:36:02.340 --> 2:36:07.860]  thanks to you because truth contradicts their manufactured narrative that's right so liberals
[2:36:07.860 --> 2:36:12.260]  always lie vox day and you guys are on fire let's finish up the segment points you want to make
[2:36:13.060 --> 2:36:18.900]  i think that's pretty much it for what i wanted to talk to you know uh on the show about in terms of
[2:36:18.900 --> 2:36:24.900]  in terms of um you know sjw is always lying the tactical ops on on how to carry out an operation
[2:36:24.900 --> 2:36:30.580]  like this vox what do you think well i think that we should talk about what's likely to happen next
[2:36:30.580 --> 2:36:38.420]  with regards to google and the panopticon and the the fact that more and more people are
[2:36:38.420 --> 2:36:46.020]  understanding how this is playing out they're understanding that this is not about transhumanism
[2:36:46.020 --> 2:36:51.460]  this is not about human progress this is all about control and this is all about a return
[2:36:52.260 --> 2:36:58.980]  to the you know the the pagan tower of babel nonsense feudalism pre-western civilization
[2:36:58.980 --> 2:37:03.220]  it's no it's not about feudalism well i mean i mean you and says in their documents we want to
[2:37:03.220 --> 2:37:08.260]  return to a global feudal system we want to return human sacrifice we want to pagan system i was
[2:37:08.260 --> 2:37:13.860]  just quoting him but expand yeah the feudalism is actually part of western civilization they
[2:37:13.860 --> 2:37:22.340]  actually want to go back to a pre-western civilization they want to go back to you know god kings
[2:37:22.340 --> 2:37:29.140]  and slaves and that's why you see that this this total well sir that's the illuminati model is
[2:37:29.140 --> 2:37:35.460]  is is absolute godhead for them everybody else dumbed out slaves a good word is called cult state
[2:37:36.660 --> 2:37:41.220]  you want to create a cult state yeah well i mean it's a cult state vox when the republicans
[2:37:41.220 --> 2:37:45.460]  can't put an ad on facebook that says we're looking for strong women well they're trying to
[2:37:45.460 --> 2:37:50.740]  build it and they're trying to get there but the last model of a cult state is egypt i think is the
[2:37:50.740 --> 2:37:59.460]  best and that lasted for 5000 years right and but they're not going to succeed because the whole
[2:37:59.460 --> 2:38:06.260]  thing is built on a edifice of debt and the debt is collapsing and so you know there's a
[2:38:06.980 --> 2:38:12.420]  pierce on georgio who's a really great survivalist author is a book coming out soon called urban
[2:38:12.420 --> 2:38:21.700]  apocalypse and he's talking about how the the system that is dependent upon electricity and
[2:38:21.700 --> 2:38:28.900]  is dependent upon debt is so fundamentally fragile that there's no chance not not a small
[2:38:28.900 --> 2:38:33.940]  you know not a remote right now there's there's no chance it will survive and so they're they're
[2:38:33.940 --> 2:38:40.900]  fundamental concepts are based on lies that's why they're creatures of the lie that's why they're
[2:38:40.900 --> 2:38:45.700]  all i mean if you look at the the heads of alphabet you look at eric schmidt you look at serigai brend
[2:38:45.700 --> 2:38:50.660]  what are they doing they're not working on human progress they're running around trying to figure
[2:38:50.660 --> 2:38:56.020]  out how to extend their lives so that they don't die and go to hell well that's yet and they're
[2:38:56.020 --> 2:39:01.780]  building emergency bunkers yep they're building emergency bunkers yeah it's crazy i mean they're
[2:39:01.780 --> 2:39:08.900]  building emergency bunkers in new zealand which the chinese are going to take over you know it's
[2:39:08.900 --> 2:39:16.660]  uh the the it says in the bible that the the ways of the wise are going to be confounded
[2:39:17.220 --> 2:39:24.500]  and we're seeing that play out right in front of us the the the wealthiest supposedly smartest
[2:39:24.500 --> 2:39:30.100]  people and actually i got a question for zack you know when you watch a television show a lot of
[2:39:30.100 --> 2:39:35.940]  times the first couple seasons are really good and then the television show just starts to suck
[2:39:35.940 --> 2:39:42.580]  after that and often what it's because the original writers have been replaced by a b team and by a c
[2:39:42.580 --> 2:39:48.020]  team and they're sure they're cashing in on the franchise it's already popular right would you
[2:39:48.020 --> 2:39:53.460]  say that that's happened at companies like google now like the the the really smart people that
[2:39:54.020 --> 2:39:59.540]  that made it successful in the beginning you know if you look at you know sergi brend and schmidt
[2:39:59.540 --> 2:40:04.260]  are they're they're busy running around with celebrities and and and sex traffickers like
[2:40:04.260 --> 2:40:08.980]  epsi now who's actually running the store i mean when i look at the the statements made by the
[2:40:08.980 --> 2:40:15.300]  google executives i don't get the impression of first class minds communicating that's right they
[2:40:15.300 --> 2:40:20.500]  bumble pretty bad in congress they they act disheveled they're not even good speakers they seem like
[2:40:20.500 --> 2:40:26.580]  a rearguard action yeah so you know all the old timers have pretty much left the company and they've
[2:40:26.580 --> 2:40:33.380]  been replaced and right now um there is i've noticed with youtube a lot of chinese infiltration
[2:40:33.380 --> 2:40:40.340]  into the company oh yeah and it's it's it's they're coming in really fast now and the thing is is that
[2:40:40.340 --> 2:40:46.500]  there seems to be different criteria that are being used to select and it's going away from
[2:40:46.500 --> 2:40:53.780]  competence and more towards loyalty and ideological subservience yeah so you think that you think
[2:40:53.780 --> 2:40:59.060]  that the diversity and inclusivity push has actually damaged their competence which actually is
[2:40:59.060 --> 2:41:04.980]  is in keeping with what i would have guessed yeah there's there's a really great document that was
[2:41:04.980 --> 2:41:10.100]  disclosed in the project veritas google dumps and that is the document called coffee beans
[2:41:10.740 --> 2:41:17.620]  and it's super weird and i recommend everyone look at it because um in fact google says this
[2:41:17.620 --> 2:41:23.380]  should not leak out because it could be very damaging uh but it it reduces people to the
[2:41:23.380 --> 2:41:27.140]  concept of coffee beans and they say some coffee beans are not as good as others but we want to
[2:41:27.140 --> 2:41:33.700]  have a blend because with the blend it tastes better right that's the that doesn't surprise me
[2:41:34.180 --> 2:41:41.220]  if i recall correctly uh a wired came out with an article about that uh not long after you after
[2:41:41.220 --> 2:41:47.540]  you and project veritas broke the news as well yeah they broke it literally hours before we went
[2:41:47.540 --> 2:41:54.260]  live so the wired article came out at six and then um the project veritas dump came out i think
[2:41:54.260 --> 2:42:00.100]  around nine a.m well i wanted to ask you about this but google because i mean i would live on google
[2:42:00.100 --> 2:42:04.820]  these have some rigging and some censorship but it's totally broken nothing works it's all just
[2:42:04.820 --> 2:42:09.860]  hands selected by them there's backdoor payments we know going on it's totally broken they've just
[2:42:09.860 --> 2:42:15.620]  ruined it yeah yeah there's like product rot and it's endemic through all the company and i remember
[2:42:15.620 --> 2:42:22.260]  when there used to be a product an outage at the company uh there'd be this really long like
[2:42:22.260 --> 2:42:27.780]  postmortem about what went wrong and how we prevent this again now they're having weekly
[2:42:28.340 --> 2:42:34.580]  nationwide outages and in the company they don't even talk about it it's not even like oh this is
[2:42:34.580 --> 2:42:40.020]  what happened they just said the whole thing stopped working for an hour purpose-driven life
[2:42:40.020 --> 2:42:43.940]  there's this arrogant they're disconnected they're censoring they don't care box day great job we
[2:42:43.940 --> 2:42:48.500]  appreciate you i promise callers we're going to every single person holding when we come back
[2:42:48.500 --> 2:42:55.300]  stay with us we're going right to ryan and ronnie on the other side thomas jefferson predicted
[2:42:56.020 --> 2:43:01.140]  over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future it'd be the farmers that
[2:43:01.140 --> 2:43:05.700]  were close to the ground close to reality who actually worked for a living that would end up
[2:43:05.700 --> 2:43:11.700]  saving the nation and today the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming goods a week ago and
[2:43:11.700 --> 2:43:17.300]  we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's doing in this trade war
[2:43:17.300 --> 2:43:22.980]  once china put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't going to be bullied
[2:43:22.980 --> 2:43:28.100]  and we aren't going to back down so to the walking cruises and the hillary clinton's the world that
[2:43:28.100 --> 2:43:32.740]  want to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never going to give up and all you've
[2:43:32.740 --> 2:43:38.660]  done is awaken the human spirit the human spirit lives at info wars dot com and news wars dot com
[2:43:38.660 --> 2:43:44.020]  and i'm asking listeners whatever you do spread those links because we are the light the dark of
[2:43:44.020 --> 2:43:56.180]  the night we are the resistance we are 1776 worldwide it's not only that you have a unique voice
[2:43:56.180 --> 2:44:00.900]  in the public arena in the public square the other thing that's unique about info wars is it is the
[2:44:00.900 --> 2:44:05.940]  only network of this reach that is not backed by a corporate donor or corporate sugar daddy that's
[2:44:05.940 --> 2:44:10.660]  not backed by some billionaire that's not being funded by secrets foreign government it is completely
[2:44:10.660 --> 2:44:16.260]  independent of all that it is an old school american 1776 style experiment in the expression
[2:44:16.260 --> 2:44:20.900]  of the freedom of press and freedom of speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the
[2:44:20.900 --> 2:44:25.620]  beginning of the country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like this
[2:44:25.620 --> 2:44:29.300]  because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now live in an era where
[2:44:29.300 --> 2:44:33.700]  they've mostly been blocked by big corporations or billionaire sugar daddies who've been able to
[2:44:33.700 --> 2:44:38.900]  control and manipulate what news and views the persons allowed to have or express or hear and
[2:44:38.900 --> 2:44:43.940]  the info wars audience has broken through that the uh that they are the bridge from the founding to
[2:44:43.940 --> 2:44:48.340]  the modern age ultimate american democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[2:44:48.340 --> 2:44:52.820]  onslaught of the black warming defamation lawfare and libel targeting youth
[2:44:57.540 --> 2:45:05.860]  it's just heavy heavy heavy make no mistake it's we're not in kansas anymore we're not in kansas
[2:45:05.860 --> 2:45:11.140]  anymore if you have a corrupt media you don't have a democracy
[2:45:13.780 --> 2:45:18.100]  i don't think we've seen division like this in america since vietnam because it's a form of fascism
[2:45:18.900 --> 2:45:24.740]  the high court will examine free speech rights and social media multiple online platforms have

[2:47:39.300 --> 2:47:44.500]  about decentralization so hang out your shingle tell people about your product uh yeah so um i
[2:47:44.500 --> 2:47:51.780]  actually made a product in 2013 um it was an invention that i had which is a bicycle glove
[2:47:51.780 --> 2:48:00.660]  with a turn signal on the back of my hand so um this has saved a lot of lives and has been making
[2:48:00.660 --> 2:48:06.420]  cyclists safer around the world and so alex i would like to be able to rep this stuff if i come on
[2:48:06.420 --> 2:48:13.300]  your show um as a as a as a host in some capacity um but uh if people want to check it out right now
[2:48:13.300 --> 2:48:22.020]  they can go to uh zackies.com that's z-a-c-k-e-e-s.com uh and uh we'll ship you a pair of gloves and
[2:48:22.020 --> 2:48:26.740]  they're amazing gloves they've got leather palms um they've got really bright lights and they've
[2:48:26.740 --> 2:48:30.180]  got a very long that makes sense that you're just doing this a light yeah just do this and people
[2:48:30.180 --> 2:48:34.260]  don't people kind of chew down a little out of the back of a bike but if it goes out they see it
[2:48:34.260 --> 2:48:38.580]  yeah yeah is there a way we can get like the website up on the on the page yeah because i know you
[2:48:38.580 --> 2:48:43.140]  didn't know i was gonna do that sorry oh they got it up quick yeah there you go so um yeah there we go
[2:48:44.900 --> 2:48:51.940]  that's exciting i always bring stuff home yeah so that's um the first uh black olympic champion
[2:48:51.940 --> 2:48:57.780]  in the olympics for cycling uh nelson veils and he wears my products all the time um he keeps
[2:48:57.780 --> 2:49:02.420]  him safe when he rides at night and as you can see he just puts out his hand like that and
[2:49:02.420 --> 2:49:05.940]  it signals and it's really amazing because the drivers really respond that's smart how does
[2:49:05.940 --> 2:49:11.220]  you come up with that just a big brain over there i just was making a lot of wearable tech and uh
[2:49:11.220 --> 2:49:16.900]  this kind of popped out as something that was uniquely like uh satisfying to the cyclists so uh
[2:49:16.900 --> 2:49:24.420]  i i originally left google in 2013 to create this product and then i went back to google in 2016
[2:49:24.420 --> 2:49:32.340]  because the money's just really good at google but uh this product is available on sale um it's uh
[2:49:32.340 --> 2:49:36.980]  everyone loves it and again they use money and not having a job to control people that's
[2:49:36.980 --> 2:49:41.700]  why all of us making our own things decentralizing is pure americana pure human all right without
[2:49:41.700 --> 2:49:48.980]  further ado and by the way since they held over an hour ryan and ronnie both get a free t-shirt uh
[2:49:48.980 --> 2:49:52.660]  okay so we'll get their name and email and give it to customer service so they can pick the one
[2:49:52.660 --> 2:49:56.820]  they want i apologize but i'm getting better i've been taking a lot more calls lately but still
[2:49:56.820 --> 2:50:01.380]  it backs up so thank you for holding ryan in florida you're on the air you want to talk about
[2:50:01.380 --> 2:50:06.180]  divide and conquer i'll go ahead hey alex i just wanted to say thank you for waking me up i was
[2:50:06.180 --> 2:50:10.900]  nine years old and i first watched your uh bohemian grove and i'm levin videos and i'm 25 now so
[2:50:10.900 --> 2:50:16.260]  thanks for all the years of info and uh i wanted to say uh to zack he makes a great member of the
[2:50:16.260 --> 2:50:20.900]  inform team and i'd love to see him have his own little like once a week tech corner to give his
[2:50:21.460 --> 2:50:25.700]  authoritative expression we were talking about that over a late lunch yesterday yeah yeah that'd be
[2:50:25.700 --> 2:50:29.940]  great because you're you're fantastic man it's great great hearing you talk but uh i wanted to
[2:50:29.940 --> 2:50:35.380]  speak on the divide and conquer tactics that the authoritarians have used against you alex for years
[2:50:35.380 --> 2:50:38.980]  and there's a couple youtubers that are going through the same sort of thing there's a body
[2:50:38.980 --> 2:50:44.340]  language ghost american renaissance con flarity and billy roper now these are all channels that you
[2:50:44.340 --> 2:50:49.540]  might like um but the tactic they use against you obviously is the strawman tactic and that
[2:50:49.540 --> 2:50:53.620]  assassinate your character and now you know new viewers don't want to associate with you because
[2:50:53.620 --> 2:50:59.220]  they think you're this bogeyman and more important you know i don't i don't really uh the audience
[2:50:59.220 --> 2:51:04.100]  a little bit over the river to my ears so i missed the names of the sites i i listen being attacked
[2:51:04.100 --> 2:51:08.900]  is just as good as being loved it means you're getting people's attention you're only allowed
[2:51:08.900 --> 2:51:14.580]  to basically have me on if you attack me uh right because because they'll ban smaller channels a
[2:51:14.580 --> 2:51:20.180]  joe rogan or a steven krauter can have me on uh but still steven krauter didn't even put my full
[2:51:20.180 --> 2:51:23.940]  interview out somebody else said that's like a million views okay so he put it out subscription
[2:51:23.940 --> 2:51:29.140]  that's because you know i mean they basically threaten them and i know joe had his biggest
[2:51:29.140 --> 2:51:33.940]  podcast ever with me so they're they're the top guys on youtube they can't even really have me on
[2:51:33.940 --> 2:51:39.140]  and so these lower level guys understand the names going to make them money and get attention
[2:51:39.780 --> 2:51:44.820]  and so they're just children i mean i don't know who those sites are but i welcome that to be attacked
[2:51:45.460 --> 2:51:51.300]  uh is you know by by by folks that you know believe that it's a stepping stone is a good thing
[2:51:51.300 --> 2:51:56.340]  as long as they're covering the new world order and other stuff i'm here i'm here to be stabbed
[2:51:56.340 --> 2:52:02.500]  i'm here to be attacked i love it i don't enjoy it um but i'm not really paying attention uh it
[2:52:02.500 --> 2:52:08.660]  it's it's it's it's a maturity thing that i didn't sign up for this to be loved by the world i signed
[2:52:08.660 --> 2:52:12.660]  up for this to change the world and to have a better future i mean you can see the victories
[2:52:12.660 --> 2:52:16.740]  we're having so yeah it's a big thing everywhere to attack me and then you you know supposedly
[2:52:16.740 --> 2:52:22.420]  your brownie points i mean you when you were on youtube you were like that's one of the top channels
[2:52:22.420 --> 2:52:28.020]  like you just popped up on my stream all the time which is the reason why that they have to ban you
[2:52:28.020 --> 2:52:32.580]  from the platform is because they don't want the truth getting out and explain how that works
[2:52:32.580 --> 2:52:36.900]  because they're to these headlines google wrote algorithm to help Alex Jones no it just means
[2:52:36.900 --> 2:52:41.140]  if you click on shark fishing videos they know you want more shark fishing or if you click on
[2:52:41.140 --> 2:52:46.260]  cycling videos you get more so we were popular and it would go to the top right like people were
[2:52:46.260 --> 2:52:52.580]  were engaging with your content and the algorithms were watching that and so they were using that to
[2:52:52.580 --> 2:52:57.700]  push you to the top because like this is what people like to listen to and so um you were
[2:52:57.700 --> 2:53:04.020]  contradicting the narratives and so they realized that in order to maintain power they had to uh
[2:53:04.020 --> 2:53:09.060]  eliminate you from the platforms and prevent you from talking and now what they said facebook
[2:53:09.060 --> 2:53:14.180]  officially and others say only talk about him in a negative light so everyone goes Alex Jones
[2:53:14.180 --> 2:53:17.220]  the piece of filth and then they talk about me but then they still get the views because
[2:53:17.220 --> 2:53:22.100]  everybody's looking for Alex Jones yeah it's very parasitic but that's what that's what children
[2:53:22.100 --> 2:53:26.660]  do they have to grow yeah and and i've been told like hey don't go on the Alex Jones show and i said
[2:53:26.660 --> 2:53:31.540]  look i'm fighting against censorship and the last thing i'm going to do is censor myself and not come
[2:53:31.540 --> 2:53:35.300]  on like a show and let me ask you this i said what do you want to cover first how great your crew is
[2:53:35.300 --> 2:53:39.300]  how truly woke they are we never got to that and i appreciate your call god bless you ryan but i mean
[2:53:39.300 --> 2:53:44.100]  you've been here you've seen this operation i mean we're totally real yeah and the thing i tell you
[2:53:44.100 --> 2:53:48.340]  we could talk about was there two hours of pre meetings like seeing in was there any i mean
[2:53:48.340 --> 2:53:55.300]  this is real yeah we just we just everyone here is is woke and uh they're fun to be with and it's
[2:53:55.300 --> 2:53:59.140]  it's there's there's no like oh you can't say this and you can't say that and there's none of that
[2:53:59.140 --> 2:54:02.740]  right it's it's it's free because we already look at people that are cool and that we think have
[2:54:02.740 --> 2:54:06.580]  interesting ideas and then it's just a discussion it's not a bunch of well let's talk about how
[2:54:06.580 --> 2:54:10.980]  we're going to say it and yeah and the thing is is that you don't have to agree with everything
[2:54:10.980 --> 2:54:18.420]  that alex jones says you only like i i agree with alex jones's right to say what he has on his mind
[2:54:18.420 --> 2:54:23.060]  to the people and for the right of the people to listen to that and you know apparently that's
[2:54:23.060 --> 2:54:28.340]  like now an extreme right wing view i mean it's it's it's mind-blowing it's like when did classical
[2:54:28.340 --> 2:54:36.500]  liberalism become a extreme right well sure i'm not i'm not virtue signaling at homosexual
[2:54:36.500 --> 2:54:40.260]  schools when i say i don't believe you should be killed and i believe you have rights and by the
[2:54:40.260 --> 2:54:45.220]  way i don't hate you i don't like your leftist ideology that's attached to you but you know
[2:54:45.220 --> 2:54:51.380]  the four are supporting the palestinians murdering gays and like where are you running around with
[2:54:51.380 --> 2:54:55.620]  all your gay virtue signaling you're not you're just bullying americans because you're on the
[2:54:55.620 --> 2:55:00.820]  chai kong payroll and don't even know it i mean that's what's sick is is is like cult like leftist
[2:55:00.820 --> 2:55:05.380]  well if you're a lesbian or you're gay you've got to be against trump and it's all a load of crap it's
[2:55:05.380 --> 2:55:12.100]  not even real right and they're and it's really funny when they went the leftists say oh islam
[2:55:12.100 --> 2:55:18.100]  is feminism you know and it's like they say upside down it's part it's part of this ideological
[2:55:18.100 --> 2:55:25.140]  subversion where they were illon has said that she's like islam is feminism yeah and women being
[2:55:25.140 --> 2:55:30.420]  sold on slave blocks women can't drive cars and you're telling me i don't want to empower women
[2:55:30.420 --> 2:55:35.060]  my god i've got three daughters they're running the damn show i mean i hope they want to be
[2:55:35.060 --> 2:55:39.220]  executives i hope they want to do stuff like that and when you treat this they want to hang out with
[2:55:39.220 --> 2:55:42.260]  their girlfriends and you know do what women do i mean it's just you know yeah and and when you
[2:55:42.260 --> 2:55:45.780]  point this out to a leftist it like triggers cognitive my daughters wanted to take over they
[2:55:45.780 --> 2:55:50.740]  would the thing is they don't want to because that's how stuff's designed right i mean men and women
[2:55:50.740 --> 2:55:56.020]  have different like built-in instincts and you know now you say that and it's like you can get banned
[2:55:56.020 --> 2:56:00.020]  off of these platforms for saying that there's differences between men and women like look at
[2:56:00.020 --> 2:56:05.860]  what happened with james demore with inside google he said hey maybe you know guys just like doing
[2:56:05.860 --> 2:56:10.260]  computer science more than women right and so they slandered him the media slandered him
[2:56:10.260 --> 2:56:16.180]  the media came out and and rewrote his manifesto it wasn't even a manifesto it was a diversity
[2:56:16.180 --> 2:56:20.420]  but a male brain has one third the connections between left and right hemisphere it's designed
[2:56:20.420 --> 2:56:26.580]  for computers it's something a woman has a uterus not saying her brain isn't just as good it has three
[2:56:26.580 --> 2:56:30.740]  times the connections between left and right hemisphere yeah and and it's a totally different
[2:56:30.740 --> 2:56:36.340]  brain i mean the brain is different and men like to go to war a little bit more and women shy away
[2:56:36.340 --> 2:56:40.900]  from violence it's like you know because here's the thing all the embryos are girls at first
[2:56:40.900 --> 2:56:45.220]  everybody knows women have a second set of DNA that men don't have women literally create their
[2:56:45.220 --> 2:56:51.300]  sons like their robots we're the drones yeah the species is women that's actually known by the
[2:56:51.300 --> 2:56:54.500]  establishment while they're targeting women telling them oh we're empowering you because they get the
[2:56:54.500 --> 2:56:59.060]  women they've got everybody it's not pandering women to tell you you're the species men are a
[2:57:00.660 --> 2:57:05.700]  clone you basically create the go out on a mission right and and that's why we do the
[2:57:05.700 --> 2:57:11.700]  dangerous stuff it's why we do it yeah exactly and and you know um there are certain things
[2:57:11.700 --> 2:57:15.780]  that men just we're ready to die for the next yeah we do and ready to die for the next i mean
[2:57:15.780 --> 2:57:19.860]  that's this is why i'm coming out like i'm coming out i'm like fighting a dragon and the thing is is
[2:57:19.860 --> 2:57:26.340]  that um uh it's something that males tend to do more and that's something that's it's very sacred
[2:57:26.340 --> 2:57:33.460]  to sacrifice yourself for the good of the tribe so you know i'm not saying that men and women are
[2:57:33.460 --> 2:57:37.540]  you know only going to be in these roles i'm saying this is just abusive it's like saying most of
[2:57:37.540 --> 2:57:43.540]  winners of long-range running or kitchens there's others that are just as good as well yeah let's
[2:57:43.540 --> 2:57:47.380]  talk to marcus in new york marcus you're on the air thanks for holding hey oh yeah i just want to
[2:57:47.380 --> 2:57:52.100]  say uh your show is a breath of fresh air i talked to a lot of people here out in new york city and
[2:57:52.100 --> 2:57:56.740]  one thing i could tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars i think that the neocons
[2:57:56.740 --> 2:58:01.620]  are trying desperately to get trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that
[2:58:01.620 --> 2:58:06.500]  they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it i mean if trump buys
[2:58:06.500 --> 2:58:10.180]  into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only way i think he can be defeated other than
[2:58:10.180 --> 2:58:13.940]  assassinating him it's the time to be praying my friend i agree entirely and the last thing i
[2:58:13.940 --> 2:58:18.340]  just want to say alex is i know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived
[2:58:18.340 --> 2:58:22.820]  man i would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old i would love to see what you're talking
[2:58:22.820 --> 2:58:28.260]  about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of
[2:58:28.260 --> 2:58:33.060]  battles and there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are going to continue we're
[2:58:33.060 --> 2:58:37.540]  going to keep fighting in the info war and even if something does happen to you or your show know
[2:58:37.540 --> 2:58:44.900]  for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling
[2:58:44.900 --> 2:58:49.860]  alex yes i got a plug for the patriot points i get oh thanks i got 180 dollars so far this
[2:58:49.860 --> 2:58:54.180]  year and i feel like i'm stealing from you i buy so much in the store because i mean i don't want
[2:58:54.180 --> 2:58:57.300]  to give that money to walmart i don't want to give that money to people who are going to donate it to
[2:58:57.300 --> 2:59:01.220]  causes i don't believe in so i'd rather give that money to you and i'm getting quality products the
[2:59:01.220 --> 2:59:06.020]  products that i do for steve have changed my life i mean the x2 has really done a lot for me i've
[2:59:06.020 --> 2:59:10.740]  lost weight my brain works a whole lot better i think my kid they use the toothpaste my son used
[2:59:10.740 --> 2:59:14.980]  to get these little uh sore throats and he puts x2 in water and drinks it and it gets rid of his
[2:59:14.980 --> 2:59:19.380]  sore throat uh well sir let me break this down for you i want high quality stuff in there i want a
[2:59:19.380 --> 2:59:24.580]  good price but i've kind of habituated everybody to where everybody buys when it's 50 off i'm making
[2:59:24.580 --> 2:59:29.060]  two dollars on the toothpaste 50 off and so it's the same thing like the fish oil or the turmeric
[2:59:29.060 --> 2:59:33.780]  or the bone broth thank you so much for the plugs but listen when people get the patriot points a lot
[2:59:33.780 --> 2:59:37.860]  of times it makes things a loss later because if you're already getting 10 off because you're on
[2:59:37.860 --> 2:59:42.100]  autoship then we're doing 50 off and then you do something like that uh where you have patriot
[2:59:42.100 --> 2:59:50.580]  points we lose money but that's okay thanks for the support you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:59:50.580 --> 3:00:03.940]  waging war it's alex jones coming to you a lot from the front lines of the info

[3:06:42.980 --> 3:06:48.420]  now we got to move quick to get everybody zack voriz is here jack you got to come back because
[3:06:48.420 --> 3:06:51.940]  you're good on talk radio you're a smart guy i can tell you've done your research you released
[3:06:51.940 --> 3:06:57.780]  the big data dump uh this morning i heard oh uh zack's at his hotel doing a fox news interview
[3:06:57.780 --> 3:07:03.060]  and i said i bet that didn't air well i guess they canceled it sarah sara carter we need to punch
[3:07:03.060 --> 3:07:07.940]  you out we need to get these videos once they're posted info wars dot com and news wars dot com the
[3:07:07.940 --> 3:07:12.580]  listeners kind of i do this too like it's kind of a thing of oh it's osmosis people know what's
[3:07:12.580 --> 3:07:17.620]  going on no the only way you learn about something they're fighting to keep you from hearing is if
[3:07:17.620 --> 3:07:22.020]  you spread it yeah that's right and that's i know i harp on that because i'm the tail the
[3:07:22.020 --> 3:07:28.260]  listeners of the dog and i'm you are the dog right and and the thing is is that don't ever
[3:07:28.260 --> 3:07:33.380]  underestimate the power that a small determined group of people have to change the world
[3:07:35.540 --> 3:07:40.260]  that's absolutely that's how it's always been yeah they always they're the ones that always
[3:07:40.260 --> 3:07:45.860]  change you know the world in every revolution did you know hitler three days before he committed
[3:07:45.860 --> 3:07:50.100]  suicide in the bunker still believed he was going to meet the russians and the in the allies
[3:07:51.060 --> 3:07:57.380]  when like 10 million troops were marching in on him okay and that's i think google and all them
[3:07:57.380 --> 3:08:00.580]  they don't get like like you said they don't even care they have allergies now they don't care
[3:08:00.580 --> 3:08:05.940]  it doesn't work anymore they've just got all this unlimited fake stock what a trillion dollar
[3:08:05.940 --> 3:08:11.540]  company almost they just don't care yeah they just don't care they have infinite amount of power
[3:08:11.540 --> 3:08:17.300]  um it's like it's like i don't even think about how much power they have because if i did um
[3:08:18.100 --> 3:08:22.500]  i would be like what the heck are you doing zack but the thing is is that i know
[3:08:22.500 --> 3:08:27.940]  that i'm in the right and i know that everyone else knows that google's in the wrong and that's
[3:08:27.940 --> 3:08:34.020]  what gives me the fuel to uh continue to push this out and oh my gosh it's just snowballing it's
[3:08:34.020 --> 3:08:40.260]  just snowballing it's getting larger and uh this is moving towards a real cultural movement
[3:08:40.260 --> 3:08:47.060]  and that cultural movement will transform into a political movement so and it's here they're scared
[3:08:47.060 --> 3:08:52.260]  they're trying to block it i mean trump is the gigantic liberal and if you really look at his
[3:08:52.260 --> 3:08:57.300]  policies and everything he actually does it's very classical liberal none of the modern sets
[3:08:57.300 --> 3:09:02.100]  but the classical thomas jeffersonian yeah and the thing is is that he's really doing a really
[3:09:02.100 --> 3:09:06.260]  great job well he doesn't look down on black people or anybody in fact he's not a lot of black
[3:09:06.260 --> 3:09:12.660]  girlfriends he he he would see himself as being weak if he looked down on someone he wants to
[3:09:12.660 --> 3:09:17.780]  empower people yeah i know that about that's why they hate him he's the opposite of a satanist
[3:09:17.780 --> 3:09:21.300]  and that's the reason why that you know google and these big tech giants are trying to scrub the
[3:09:21.300 --> 3:09:26.900]  internet and uh make it so that people can't find you know the pictures of donald trump
[3:09:26.900 --> 3:09:32.100]  with these black leaders throughout his career because that contradicts the manufactured narrative
[3:09:32.100 --> 3:09:38.500]  that is projecting on trailblazed bringing blacks into resorts and golf courses and these luxury
[3:09:38.500 --> 3:09:42.420]  buildings where there were like 90 year old weird white people who didn't want to be next to white
[3:09:42.420 --> 3:09:45.380]  people that weren't rich and powerful let me tell you get around rich people they hate everybody
[3:09:45.380 --> 3:09:50.020]  unless you're in the weird club so they hate white people hispanics blacks like folks think like oh
[3:09:50.020 --> 3:09:54.500]  old rich white people don't like me old chinese people don't like people that aren't rich like
[3:09:54.500 --> 3:09:59.220]  them or old black old rich black people to say it's an elitism right but trump isn't about the
[3:09:59.220 --> 3:10:04.580]  elitism he's about everybody gets it and it's really funny because like people say oh america's
[3:10:04.580 --> 3:10:10.100]  racist and i've done my traveling america's actually the least racist country that i've ever
[3:10:10.100 --> 3:10:15.060]  been to in my life i mean nothing is china but they're racist right japan's role they're like
[3:10:15.060 --> 3:10:20.340]  they have a bias towards their own like people right and and we take south korea or korea if
[3:10:20.340 --> 3:10:24.820]  you're born on a wedlock you're seen as a ghost child and subhuman that's why they have to adopt
[3:10:24.820 --> 3:10:28.820]  all the kids and my sister isn't listening she's a wonderful person we adopted her because you know
[3:10:28.820 --> 3:10:33.540]  she was from a single mom that's sick man yeah i think it's asians they're great people but
[3:10:33.540 --> 3:10:39.380]  you're saying america's racist like like what are they doesn't let muslims into the country period
[3:10:39.380 --> 3:10:44.900]  like what like what are they judging that against like america's racist like in comparison to what
[3:10:44.900 --> 3:10:51.220]  if we're the least racist so all you're selling people as slaves today libya you know it's like
[3:10:51.220 --> 3:10:57.860]  go anywhere in the country exactly so i'm sending the lies like we we are exceptional for the good
[3:10:57.860 --> 3:11:01.780]  things we've done yeah we got powerful we got corrupt we've been bad too but i'm just sick of
[3:11:01.780 --> 3:11:06.820]  the religion of hating america teaching us to hate ourselves it goes back to the demoralization
[3:11:06.820 --> 3:11:12.020]  that's right and and and it's a tactic it's being applied to the minds of american people in order
[3:11:12.020 --> 3:11:17.540]  to change the perception of what reality is in order to humans do whether it's a corrupt girlfriend
[3:11:17.540 --> 3:11:21.700]  or husband or whatever they tell you you suck they tell you did something bad and all they want
[3:11:21.700 --> 3:11:26.980]  you to do is say you're bad and they're above you and no i'm intentionally not hurting anyone i
[3:11:26.980 --> 3:11:32.580]  want to be good i want to be with god i'm a sinner but i want to be good i'm sick of hearing how i'm
[3:11:32.580 --> 3:11:37.220]  bad and i'm not gonna hear it anymore yeah yeah i'm glad you're taking a stand do you want to take
[3:11:37.220 --> 3:11:46.580]  some uh let's do it let's do it let's go ahead and talk to uh google in the classroom chase in
[3:11:46.580 --> 3:11:53.700]  california go ahead chase thank you so much for taking my call alex and zach thank you so much
[3:11:53.700 --> 3:12:00.180]  for what you're doing thank you an educator i've been an educator for 15 years here in crazy california
[3:12:00.180 --> 3:12:05.140]  and i want you to know that the last few years they've been putting into our school district the
[3:12:05.140 --> 3:12:11.780]  google classroom system they give every student a laptop they have to sign into google and everything
[3:12:11.780 --> 3:12:18.100]  that these students are typing writing looking up watching is all being collected by the google
[3:12:18.100 --> 3:12:24.020]  database and so zach i appreciate if you would talk about this what do they notice facebook said
[3:12:24.900 --> 3:12:30.660]  we will ban you in the future with your social id for what you wrote in the past so think about
[3:12:30.660 --> 3:12:35.620]  that big corporation is directly knowing more about your kid than you do right and now they're
[3:12:35.620 --> 3:12:40.660]  introducing this new policy where uh and it's not just google it's multiple tech giants are
[3:12:40.660 --> 3:12:47.780]  introducing this policy where they're going to um they can ban you from platforms based on your
[3:12:47.780 --> 3:12:53.620]  off-platform behavior okay so what they're trying to do is they're trying to implement a social credit
[3:12:53.620 --> 3:12:59.300]  system but lie about it and they're just gonna it's called the totalitarian tiptoe where they just
[3:12:59.300 --> 3:13:04.580]  make these incremental changes closer and closer and closer until all of a sudden we wake up and
[3:13:04.580 --> 3:13:08.980]  we're in a communist but you're right like here here in austin the schools get apple ipads or
[3:13:08.980 --> 3:13:12.740]  whatever and that's all going back to the chi comp same thing when google is going back to their
[3:13:12.740 --> 3:13:17.620]  i mean this is insane yeah and so the thing is is that you know google was painted as this really
[3:13:17.620 --> 3:13:23.460]  great company and so they're they wanted to like help educate the world with really cheap laptops
[3:13:23.460 --> 3:13:29.300]  and so you know they they snuck it in everyone got in there and now we're all realizing that google
[3:13:29.300 --> 3:13:34.420]  is this really easy uh evil malicious corporation and they're now more apparent than you are yeah
[3:13:34.420 --> 3:13:40.980]  and now we've and now we've got to like you know de-infiltrate our our country from this evil
[3:13:40.980 --> 3:13:46.340]  corporation that would be against the school having computers for kids but it's google yeah it's app
[3:13:46.340 --> 3:13:51.140]  it's them it's their curriculum yeah it's their curriculum you know and the thing is is that you
[3:13:51.140 --> 3:13:56.260]  think that they're just going to open up the access for other oh no they're tracking what you just
[3:13:56.260 --> 3:14:01.460]  like in what's up at whatsapp with facebook they're already blocking you're sending out memeworld.com
[3:14:01.460 --> 3:14:07.060]  it's here they're launching it on every cylinder thank you chase let's jam in one more here
[3:14:07.060 --> 3:14:12.900]  Aaron in florida you're on the air go ahead yes Alex it's an honor to be on the show thank you
[3:14:12.900 --> 3:14:18.900]  honor sir go ahead yes sir um Zach thank you for uh coming out with the courage come out and
[3:14:18.900 --> 3:14:24.980]  i know it takes a lot man so appreciate that um i had a question for Zach a couple questions
[3:14:24.980 --> 3:14:32.020]  ask go ahead um i've been detoxing from google um so i've been using duck duck go and i've been
[3:14:32.020 --> 3:14:37.620]  using the brave browser and i was wondering Zach what you thought of those and also what
[3:14:37.620 --> 3:14:43.300]  you think about cryptocurrencies and possibly is there a way to design like a decentralized
[3:14:43.300 --> 3:14:49.700]  search engine or video platform a lot of great questions wow a lot of great questions if i can
[3:14:49.700 --> 3:14:55.220]  remember all those all those questions so first off um you know start page and duck duck go are great
[3:14:55.220 --> 3:15:00.260]  alternatives to google search so if you're looking to detox from the google search then you know i
[3:15:00.260 --> 3:15:06.100]  challenged the audience that's listening in here to do at least just one google uh one search
[3:15:06.100 --> 3:15:11.380]  not on google but with duck duck go or start page and us using that empowers those platforms right
[3:15:11.380 --> 3:15:14.660]  exactly and what we're what we're telling google is that if they're going to censor us then we're
[3:15:14.660 --> 3:15:19.700]  going to censor them your second question which was what do i think about the brave browser well
[3:15:20.340 --> 3:15:27.300]  so a lot of people used to like the firefox browser but then they started to uh get subverted
[3:15:27.300 --> 3:15:33.140]  and they kicked the founder off well the founder went to the brave browser he took the chrome um
[3:15:33.140 --> 3:15:38.740]  browser and he uh he created his own version of it which he called brave and when you go
[3:15:38.740 --> 3:15:44.740]  into private mode it actually uses the tor browser which is untrackable so i really recommend everyone
[3:15:44.740 --> 3:15:52.660]  use the brave browser brave browser brave browser brave browser or calls finally there's a way for
[3:15:52.660 --> 3:15:58.900]  you to get into the blockchain the hottest financial sector without all the speculation no enjoy a 27
[3:15:58.900 --> 3:16:03.780]  percent annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of bitcoin seen on programs broadcast
[3:16:03.780 --> 3:16:08.500]  on fox business news blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive

[3:20:33.140 --> 3:20:39.300]  and same with california in fact my mom almost died in a fire uh also there was a huge fire that
[3:20:39.300 --> 3:20:44.260]  broke out at my brother's wedding last year during the summer in the columbia gorge uh we had to do
[3:20:44.260 --> 3:20:50.660]  a go fund me to to help him out um and uh and this year there's been no fires but what's been really
[3:20:50.660 --> 3:20:57.060]  interesting is that brazil has had a lot of fires and the president brazil came out and said that
[3:20:57.060 --> 3:21:02.420]  these fires are being started by ngo's now this was something that i suspected that was happening
[3:21:02.420 --> 3:21:07.940]  in the united states well we know the soros groups that have been caught before yeah in russia and you
[3:21:07.940 --> 3:21:13.060]  other areas ukraine's starting fires yeah there's they're starting fires and then the media was like
[3:21:13.060 --> 3:21:18.020]  saying oh this is global warming this is global warming and then trump came out and said what
[3:21:18.020 --> 3:21:22.740]  about the you know the mismanagement of the forests and they all the less right there starts
[3:21:22.740 --> 3:21:26.660]  the fires by not letting you cut underbrush right and then it all just builds up let's take some

[3:21:51.780 --> 3:21:56.340]  phone that i had i kept getting these little announcements and reminders even though i never
[3:21:56.340 --> 3:22:02.260]  signed up for that app or nor did i sign up to be reminded about my financial statements this
[3:22:02.260 --> 3:22:07.620]  app was telling me hey check this out on your next credit card statement you're going to owe this
[3:22:07.620 --> 3:22:14.740]  much money so be aware it was you're saying it was you're saying it was hacking you yes it was
[3:22:14.740 --> 3:22:22.020]  spying on my web browsing and reading you know it wasn't being accurate but it was still trying to
[3:22:22.020 --> 3:22:26.980]  tell me what was coming up and it was spying on me and i never consented to this neither through
[3:22:26.980 --> 3:22:32.260]  my credit cards or through the app andy i think you've had something here central instead of even
[3:22:32.260 --> 3:22:36.100]  going after him for censorship what they're doing how about all the illegal spying that makes the
[3:22:36.100 --> 3:22:42.420]  nsa blush how about all they're in they admit they ten years ago they're listening to you over the
[3:22:42.420 --> 3:22:47.300]  microphones and giving you ads sack yeah you know and this is something that people have been able
[3:22:47.300 --> 3:22:54.340]  to discover by um uh saying a new word um like hey we need to buy product x we need to buy product x
[3:22:54.340 --> 3:22:59.540]  we need to have buy product x and the screen was shut off and then all of a sudden product x started
[3:22:59.540 --> 3:23:05.300]  like appearing in their um social media here's an example kit daniel's walked in here last week and he
[3:23:05.300 --> 3:23:11.620]  said fantasy island is what jeffrey ebbstein model is life after and no one had said that until he
[3:23:11.620 --> 3:23:17.300]  said he wrote an article and i went that's weird and then all of a sudden in my youtube feeds google
[3:23:17.300 --> 3:23:22.740]  feeds everywhere was fantasy island rickardo mattobon so he literally heard me saying fantasy
[3:23:22.740 --> 3:23:27.860]  island and fed me fantasy which they admit they're doing yeah i mean my god that is creepy man you
[3:23:27.860 --> 3:23:31.540]  you know and the thing is is that they tell you it's a conspiracy theory but then you go and you

[3:23:49.620 --> 3:23:53.700]  to and this is wow i mean they're listening i told you this 20 years ago folks but now it's admitted
[3:23:53.700 --> 3:23:59.540]  yeah and project veritas leaked this this year where uh people were these these these contractors

[3:24:40.260 --> 3:24:46.340]  and i used an unlisted mississippi phone and i would say a female inspector that broke down on
[3:24:46.340 --> 3:24:55.620]  your uh show that day seven years ago um i vaguely remember that i vaguely remember that i uh i used
[3:24:55.620 --> 3:25:01.140]  an unlisted number and they threatened to kill my son if i didn't shut that up about philadelphia
[3:25:01.140 --> 3:25:06.980]  and that's when i knew your show was real um wow i mean just recap what happened to you uh

[3:25:16.820 --> 3:25:25.060]  from two storms that got named and and uh we were doing it illegally and i tried bringing it to light
[3:25:25.060 --> 3:25:29.620]  and they threatened to kill my son over they threatened to arrest me before that uh for violating
[3:25:29.620 --> 3:25:36.740]  people's civil rights but so but uh took me a couple of years and i started buying the products um

[3:32:31.220 --> 3:32:35.860]  to make real the actions of independent free speech to make real the original promise of an
[3:32:35.860 --> 3:32:40.500]  independent free press real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each
[3:32:40.500 --> 3:32:44.580]  other to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the whopper
[3:32:44.580 --> 3:32:48.580]  of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of gaslighting what you
[3:32:48.580 --> 3:32:57.380]  just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what what you just saw you're listening to the alex
[3:32:57.380 --> 3:33:09.620]  jones show
[3:33:14.740 --> 3:33:21.620]  major huge google whistleblower the the ed snowden of all this we're talking about this being the
[3:33:21.620 --> 3:33:24.900]  mark of the beast and i'm sorry the last three colors we can't get to i appreciate you holding
[3:33:24.900 --> 3:33:29.780]  club back tomorrow i promise you don't have the line if you tell them but whether you live in god
[3:33:29.780 --> 3:33:34.740]  the bible or not this is a world government corporate system that if you don't behave the
[3:33:34.740 --> 3:33:38.980]  way they want they're not going to let you live i mean that is such a dangerous tyranny and it's
[3:33:38.980 --> 3:33:43.380]  all happening now it's not coming it's all manifesting it's all moving at breakneck speed
[3:33:44.180 --> 3:33:48.660]  yeah that's correct you know this has been a plan that's thousands of years in the making
[3:33:48.660 --> 3:33:53.620]  and they keep on trying to implement it and then it collapses hilariously and then they
[3:33:53.620 --> 3:33:59.460]  regroup and try again so this is just the latest iteration in a very long fight and our forefathers
[3:33:59.460 --> 3:34:04.020]  that created this country knew this and that's reason why they created the constitution is because
[3:34:04.020 --> 3:34:10.180]  that constitution is a how-to manual on how to prevent the the the collapse of america by
[3:34:10.180 --> 3:34:16.340]  you know keeping the fundamental rights that we can use to combat this world government
[3:34:16.340 --> 3:34:20.900]  and this subversion of our why are they so aco cd throughout history they do the same plan like
[3:34:20.900 --> 3:34:25.540]  it's a transmission over and over again yeah i mean the reason why they do it is because um
[3:34:26.580 --> 3:34:32.580]  it works and uh they believe that there's going to be a world government one day that and they
[3:34:32.580 --> 3:34:37.300]  think that the only question is which royal bloodline will run it and so they're all in competition
[3:34:37.300 --> 3:34:41.540]  but the but they're still building the system because they believe they're gonna sit in the throne
[3:34:41.540 --> 3:34:45.140]  right they're all building the system together they're trying to create globalism they thought
[3:34:45.140 --> 3:34:50.420]  that they had it at this time with the world government but it um it failed because they they
[3:34:50.420 --> 3:34:56.180]  violated natural law too much and now the rubber band is snapping back that's why they're always
[3:34:56.180 --> 3:35:00.660]  trying to suspend natural law and make an artificiality because what they're trying to set up is
[3:35:00.660 --> 3:35:05.140]  alien all right thank you so much for the time appreciate you visiting us here in austin folks

[3:35:55.940 --> 3:36:03.620]  a pair of them uh for safe night riding you know as we've observed since the collapse of the russian
[3:36:03.620 --> 3:36:11.540]  collusion narrative the left has done a huge pivot straight into trump is a racist and all
[3:36:11.540 --> 3:36:18.020]  trump supporters especially you know whites white christian men are the worst they're all racists
[3:36:18.020 --> 3:36:27.220]  too and just like um npc bots that's which kind of remind me of um like electronic diodes you know
[3:36:27.220 --> 3:36:33.220]  you switch to the current and they all change their polarity like boom all at the same time like
[3:36:33.220 --> 3:36:41.860]  magnetic filings or the uh the communists after the uh after hitler invaded germany in 1941
[3:36:42.660 --> 3:36:48.980]  the the communists around the world in america etc all went from hitler is a great guy another
[3:36:48.980 --> 3:36:55.860]  kind of socialist to hitler is the arch fascist demon and all around the world the globalists
[3:36:55.860 --> 3:37:02.500]  like on a on a mark doom right face left face just like little robots and that's what we're seeing
[3:37:02.500 --> 3:37:09.860]  now trump is an instant racist and zack was mentioning how google which i call gulag google
[3:37:09.860 --> 3:37:14.500]  has been has been scrubbing and making more difficult to find you know pushing down the
[3:37:14.500 --> 3:37:22.100]  search results all of the hundreds and hundreds of images of um president trump uh with black
[3:37:22.100 --> 3:37:27.460]  leaders over the past you know 30 40 years because trump's been a big guy for a long long time
[3:37:27.460 --> 3:37:33.460]  and you know it it's really not hard to find if you just um if you just do google uh or
[3:37:33.460 --> 3:37:40.500]  bing or any other search for you know trump with jesse jackson trump with with al sharpton now he's
[3:37:40.500 --> 3:37:46.340]  the boogie man and the demon but you know for decades he was the he was the toast of the town
[3:37:46.340 --> 3:37:52.180]  he was welcome all over new york city and uh black leaders flock to him and there they are all
[3:37:52.180 --> 3:37:58.740]  grinning and smiling but now he's that he's the boogie man and the maga hat is the new kkk hood
[3:37:58.740 --> 3:38:04.420]  you know that's what they're that's what they're trying to tell us but as this this switch is going
[3:38:04.420 --> 3:38:13.620]  to um unfortunately result in of in a new civil war i truly believe the democrats they don't have
[3:38:13.620 --> 3:38:21.540]  the self-awareness to realize that pushing identity politics to this extreme is going to have a really
[3:38:21.540 --> 3:38:27.860]  terrible negative consequence you know i think it was about 20 years ago the democrat party
[3:38:27.860 --> 3:38:34.420]  basically wrote off working class america and hitched their wagon to identity politics and the
[3:38:34.420 --> 3:38:41.700]  concept was to was to pull in all the aggrieved minorities both racial you know blacks in
[3:38:41.700 --> 3:38:50.660]  a native americans indians as well as immigrants of lbgt community everybody everybody with an
[3:38:50.660 --> 3:38:57.780]  axe to grind versus you know the old guard the white christian men you know the of middle america
[3:38:58.340 --> 3:39:04.500]  and now they've now they've backed themselves into the corner where they can no longer appeal to
[3:39:04.500 --> 3:39:11.140]  that white white middle class american men and they've got to go further and further to the extreme
[3:39:11.140 --> 3:39:17.380]  and demonize that that group the group that elected trump now they're demonizing and i
[3:39:17.380 --> 3:39:24.100]  think that it's political suicide unless the economy totally collapses over the next 18 months
[3:39:24.100 --> 3:39:28.660]  i think that which is always a possibility you know even events around the world could
[3:39:28.660 --> 3:39:34.180]  lead us into something like a global recession that of course would be blamed on trump but
[3:39:34.180 --> 3:39:44.900]  but if if the if the democrats nominate a kamala harris or any of these on any of these radicals
[3:39:45.460 --> 3:39:50.820]  they are going to take this in a direction that is going to get more and more shrill and hysterical
[3:39:51.380 --> 3:39:57.060]  and the the white trump voters aren't going to put up with it in fact a lot of white democrats
[3:39:57.060 --> 3:40:03.380]  aren't going to tolerate being called a racist and and eventually you know there's going to come
[3:40:03.380 --> 3:40:09.540]  a breaking point in this country we're going to see more and more acts of terror from antifa
[3:40:10.420 --> 3:40:17.780]  and possibly staged attacks or just um you know mentally unstable people being compelled feeling
[3:40:17.780 --> 3:40:23.940]  compelled to go out and uh carry out acts of terrorism and the pressure and underneath the
[3:40:23.940 --> 3:40:28.980]  country is going to grow and grow and i think that this is actually not at a you know at a
[3:40:28.980 --> 3:40:34.260]  conscious spoken level but this is where the democrats are taking this country because i
[3:40:34.260 --> 3:40:40.420]  think that they realize as long as there is an electoral college they can't win they they're
[3:40:40.420 --> 3:40:47.540]  not going to win by demonizing you know caucasian america conservative america calling us you know
[3:40:47.540 --> 3:40:54.100]  racists and and nazis so what they're going to do is is lead to such a bitter climate
[3:40:54.100 --> 3:41:00.180]  that there's going to be a social explosion and if if democrats if i call them the demsox the
[3:41:00.180 --> 3:41:06.420]  democrats socialists if they can't win by an election you know an election to them is just
[3:41:06.420 --> 3:41:14.500]  one means to attain power if they can't win by by the electoral process then blowing up the entire
[3:41:14.500 --> 3:41:19.780]  system uh resulting in some form of emergency government whether it's from the right or from
[3:41:19.780 --> 3:41:24.660]  the left this is also part of the socialist playbook lennon called it the worst the better
[3:41:24.660 --> 3:41:31.860]  you know creating the the climate for revolutionary change but but you know it's not going to lead
[3:41:31.860 --> 3:41:38.740]  to the outcome that they want because our our founding fathers had the foresight to not only
[3:41:38.740 --> 3:41:44.740]  write the constitution as zack was saying it's like a how-to manual for safeguarding against
[3:41:44.740 --> 3:41:51.380]  tyranny but they put in the first and second amendments as the as the two primary bulwarks
[3:41:52.100 --> 3:41:57.300]  number one is is that we can say anything we want and we can peaceably assemble of course
[3:41:57.300 --> 3:42:02.820]  antifa doesn't believe in that and they you know they come out with clubs and bike locks when
[3:42:02.820 --> 3:42:08.420]  conservatives peaceably assemble but americans see what's going on and the second amendment
[3:42:08.420 --> 3:42:15.220]  right behind the first amendment is the guardian they knew that eventually the forces that tend
[3:42:15.220 --> 3:42:25.220]  to aggregate uh power in the hands of tyrants would need a a civilian check a a power as strong as
[3:42:25.220 --> 3:42:31.780]  any uh standing army that could ever be created they that was actually what the they were writing
[3:42:31.780 --> 3:42:38.180]  about that the second amendment would lead to an american civilian force that would be able to
[3:42:38.180 --> 3:42:43.940]  prevent and overthrow any tyrannical government that was ever going to come down uh find the
[3:42:43.940 --> 3:42:49.860]  future which seems to be where we are now and i'm going to uh continue on this right after this break
[3:42:51.220 --> 3:42:57.220]  the globalists are hyper competitive scientific dictators they are technocrats they are control
[3:42:57.220 --> 3:43:01.300]  freaks in their own words and they believe allowing you to live your own life and make your own
[3:43:01.300 --> 3:43:06.820]  decisions gets to the way of their great destiny to merge with ai gods now we're fighting them
[3:43:06.820 --> 3:43:11.380]  hard in cyberspace we're fighting them hard right here in the third dimension but one of the biggest
[3:43:11.380 --> 3:43:16.900]  places that we neglect to forget that we've really got a lot of control in our lives is our bodies
[3:43:16.900 --> 3:43:22.100]  if i wasn't taking the highest quality supplements for the forest life dot com i couldn't do it
[3:43:22.100 --> 3:43:26.980]  that's why we decided to take our original secret 12 that was incredibly high quality metal
[3:43:26.980 --> 3:43:34.180]  bottom and double the strength of it in a new formula ultra 12 ultra 12 is undoubtedly the
[3:43:34.180 --> 3:43:39.060]  strongest highest quality b12 over the counter that you're going to find anywhere it is amazing
[3:43:39.060 --> 3:43:44.660]  experience pure metal cabalamin b12 for yourself and fund the second america revolution against
[3:43:44.660 --> 3:43:53.140]  the tyrants at info wars store dot com in force life dot com or triple a 253 3139 i talk about this
[3:43:53.140 --> 3:43:57.220]  on the air and i know it sinks into people but i've decided that we're going to kind of reboot
[3:43:57.220 --> 3:44:01.380]  all our supplements in that if you go back five six years ago before all the censorship of attacks
[3:44:01.380 --> 3:44:05.140]  and fake lawsuits the rest of it i would talk about how great the products are and how they were
[3:44:05.140 --> 3:44:08.980]  the best and why they were and i'd have doctors on an experts to explain why they were so good
[3:44:08.980 --> 3:44:13.060]  and instead the last few years i'm like hey we need to really support us or they'll shut us down
[3:44:13.060 --> 3:44:15.860]  the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements because they know how great they are and how
[3:44:15.860 --> 3:44:20.580]  wonderful they were and the left always has headlines everywhere jones shells unapproved
[3:44:20.580 --> 3:44:26.660]  supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996 you can't say
[3:44:26.660 --> 3:44:30.820]  that a supplement has been through the fda because they have no jurisdiction it won't look at it but
[3:44:30.820 --> 3:44:35.220]  then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying
[3:44:35.220 --> 3:44:38.980]  to tweak what's in mother nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs
[3:44:38.980 --> 3:44:43.300]  work great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want you knowing
[3:44:43.300 --> 3:44:50.260]  about god's medicine chest info war store dot com or triple eight two five three three one three nine
[3:44:52.580 --> 3:44:59.140]  thomas jefferson predicted over 240 years ago that when our republic was in trouble in the future
[3:44:59.140 --> 3:45:04.180]  it'd be the farmers that were close to the ground close to reality who actually work for a living
[3:45:04.180 --> 3:45:08.980]  that would end up saving the nation and today the communist chinese have banned all u.s farming
[3:45:08.980 --> 3:45:15.140]  goods a week ago and we've seen massive increases in polls support for the president and what he's
[3:45:15.140 --> 3:45:21.140]  doing in this trade war once china put pressure on our farmers that's beautiful americans aren't
[3:45:21.140 --> 3:45:26.580]  going to be bullied and we aren't going to back down so to the walking cruises and the hillary
[3:45:26.580 --> 3:45:31.060]  clinton's the world that want to intimidate people and tell us to back down we're never going to give
[3:45:31.060 --> 3:45:36.580]  up and all you've done is awaken the human spirit and the human spirit lives at info wars dot com
[3:45:36.580 --> 3:45:41.940]  and news wars dot com and i'm asking listeners whatever you do spread those links because
[3:45:41.940 --> 3:45:47.140]  we are the light the dark of the night we are the resistance we are 1776 worldwide
[3:45:47.140 --> 3:46:03.700]  it's just heavy heavy heavy make no mistake it's we're not in kansas anymore we're not in kansas
[3:46:03.700 --> 3:46:12.740]  anymore if you have a corrupt media you don't have a democracy i don't think we've seen division
[3:46:12.740 --> 3:46:18.500]  like this in america since vietnam because it's a form of fascism the high court will examine
[3:46:18.500 --> 3:46:24.500]  free speech rights and social media multiple online platforms have now taken down content
[3:46:24.500 --> 3:46:43.380]  associated with alex jones and info wars first take number alice jones everyone else like dominoes would fall
[3:46:43.380 --> 3:46:44.740]  we're not in kansas anymore
[3:46:44.740 --> 3:46:52.180]  you can't watch this the movie available now at info wars store dot com
[3:46:55.380 --> 3:47:00.660]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:00.660 --> 3:47:23.300]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones and now your host matt bracken
[3:47:23.300 --> 3:47:32.900]  okay um we're talking about the left's big pivot from trump is a russian colluding trader
[3:47:33.460 --> 3:47:40.820]  i forget that never mind didn't work out now trump is a is a white racist and he's he's the
[3:47:40.820 --> 3:47:47.940]  magahat is a klan hood and anybody who supports trump might as well be in the kukleks klan
[3:47:47.940 --> 3:47:54.500]  or might as well be an american nazi now something that's really critical to understanding this
[3:47:54.500 --> 3:48:01.780]  narrative is how the left uses language as a weapon to read literally redefine terms that
[3:48:01.780 --> 3:48:10.100]  we've all understood forever in a in a new way and in this way they are really making a powerful
[3:48:10.100 --> 3:48:20.980]  weapon out of two innocuous words when combined put american caucasian christians judeo christian
[3:48:20.980 --> 3:48:27.140]  value people whether they're churchgoers or not into the position into a defensive posture basically
[3:48:27.140 --> 3:48:36.180]  as you know as born original sin thought criminals and that is these two terms are white
[3:48:36.180 --> 3:48:42.580]  and nationalism now we were always told all through the civil rights area that race was
[3:48:42.580 --> 3:48:47.380]  an immutable characteristic you couldn't blame somebody for their skin color now i didn't choose
[3:48:47.380 --> 3:48:55.700]  to be born of uh you know irish ancestry i was just born this way i can't help it folks and i'm
[3:48:55.700 --> 3:49:01.700]  also a nationalist which means a patriot and i was really interested in this and i there are
[3:49:01.700 --> 3:49:09.460]  actually articles comparing nationalism to patriotism i found a uh pre 2000 uh webster's
[3:49:09.460 --> 3:49:17.620]  dictionary and it has the actual dictionary definition of nationalism as of 20 years ago
[3:49:17.620 --> 3:49:26.580]  which was that nationalism is is just devotion to one's nation and patriotism there's nothing
[3:49:26.580 --> 3:49:31.940]  negative in there you know a nationalist is just a patriot he's a guy who loves his nation
[3:49:32.660 --> 3:49:39.380]  and now if you look up the definition on google or any search engine all of the online dictionaries
[3:49:40.100 --> 3:49:47.140]  give nationalism a negative spin you know it's not it's not that you they still have the loyalty
[3:49:47.140 --> 3:49:53.380]  and devotion to a nation but then it's you know it's exalting your nation above others and and uh
[3:49:53.380 --> 3:49:59.460]  you know it's almost like you're a national supremacist and the the non coincidental
[3:50:00.740 --> 3:50:06.740]  example that they use is intense nationalism was one of the causes of the war so you see how
[3:50:06.740 --> 3:50:13.700]  they are putting a negative meaning on nationalism went up until recent times nationalism was a
[3:50:13.700 --> 3:50:21.060]  literal synonym for patriotism so now what they're doing is conflating the concept of being a white
[3:50:21.060 --> 3:50:28.100]  nationalist i'm white i can't help it okay so i guess if i'm a nationalist and i'm white i guess
[3:50:28.100 --> 3:50:33.540]  i'm a white nationalist that means i must have been at charlottesville you know marching with the
[3:50:33.540 --> 3:50:41.620]  clan i mean this is how they do it folks i get it white supremacism that's not a good thing you
[3:50:41.620 --> 3:50:48.260]  know it's not a good thing i get it but what they're saying is white nationalism is equal to white
[3:50:48.260 --> 3:50:55.780]  supremacism so that folks won't be able to distinguish the two and anybody that is a patriot
[3:50:55.780 --> 3:51:03.380]  who happens to be of the Caucasian persuasion is automatically going to be shunned and considered
[3:51:03.380 --> 3:51:14.020]  some kind of of a throwback evil person just born evil and and this is being amplified across
[3:51:14.020 --> 3:51:21.860]  all kinds all kinds of media today and big examples and small and a big example is the new york times
[3:51:21.860 --> 3:51:29.140]  has this thing out now called project 1619 that's when the first african slaves were brought to
[3:51:29.140 --> 3:51:37.540]  america and what the new york times is attempting to do is to stick the original sin of slavery
[3:51:37.540 --> 3:51:46.900]  from 400 years ago on to the backs of every living american conservative today you don't
[3:51:46.900 --> 3:51:52.340]  deserve to be heard you've you've just got to go around wearing sackcloth and ashes you should be
[3:51:52.340 --> 3:51:58.660]  self-flagellating and apologizing apologizing morning noon and night because 400 years ago
[3:51:59.220 --> 3:52:06.500]  blacks were brought to america as slaves and the way that this is portrayed is to give especially
[3:52:06.500 --> 3:52:12.340]  you know the millennials and younger people without much history background the idea that that
[3:52:12.980 --> 3:52:20.500]  white european christians were some kind of evil doers who invented slavery and came up with
[3:52:20.500 --> 3:52:26.980]  the idea of let's go to africa grab a bunch of africans and drag them to america and nothing
[3:52:26.980 --> 3:52:34.260]  could be further from the truth the truth is that europeans inherited slavery and in fact
[3:52:34.260 --> 3:52:40.500]  after the fall of the roman empire slavery had diminished and almost gone away in europe there
[3:52:40.500 --> 3:52:47.380]  were still systems of feudalism where you you know you were uh like a sharecropper in a sense
[3:52:47.380 --> 3:52:53.460]  tied to the land but nobody was keeping you there in chains not chattel slavery where your children
[3:52:53.460 --> 3:53:01.060]  were born slaves that didn't even exist that was in fact reintroduced to europe with the islamic
[3:53:01.060 --> 3:53:12.180]  conquest of spain in the 700s to the 1400s so in islam even until today islam has slavery as an
[3:53:12.180 --> 3:53:20.900]  integral part of sharia law in fact when when um slave when slavery was still existing in africa
[3:53:20.900 --> 3:53:27.540]  in the open until this the 20th century when the european colonists primarily the french and
[3:53:27.540 --> 3:53:34.740]  italians actually forcibly abolished the slave markets and saudi arabia didn't get rid of open
[3:53:34.740 --> 3:53:41.060]  slave markets until the 1960s when they kind of pushed it underground but it's still a part of
[3:53:41.060 --> 3:53:48.180]  sharia law so slavery came into spain with the islamic conquest it became you know very intermingled
[3:53:48.180 --> 3:53:54.900]  it was a 700 year ray conquest of spain and the spanish retained that form of chattel slavery
[3:53:54.900 --> 3:54:01.380]  that is if you capture enemy you can enslave them and their children will also be your slaves
[3:54:01.380 --> 3:54:06.340]  they brought that they brought that to the new world but when the first spaniards even arrived
[3:54:06.340 --> 3:54:13.380]  in the new world in the 1500s guess what there was already slavery in america indian tribes
[3:54:13.380 --> 3:54:19.780]  were practicing slavery against each other so in fact there were shipwrecked spanish sailors
[3:54:19.780 --> 3:54:25.860]  who were enslaved by indian tribes in florida and elsewhere who when they were that when they
[3:54:25.860 --> 3:54:32.260]  escaped or were were recaptured by spanish they actually were some of the first translators
[3:54:32.260 --> 3:54:39.860]  escaped spanish slaves who had escaped from slaveholding indian tribes so this whole idea
[3:54:39.860 --> 3:54:47.460]  that europeans are uniquely evil invented slavery and built the entire country on the institution
[3:54:47.460 --> 3:54:54.980]  of slavery is completely false and in fact in the declaration of independence the seed of abolition
[3:54:54.980 --> 3:55:01.060]  was planted with the line all men are created equal they meant all men now that was an inherent
[3:55:01.060 --> 3:55:07.300]  conflict with the institution of slavery i get it but they knew that and they were building in
[3:55:07.300 --> 3:55:14.260]  the seeds of abolition because even when the constitution was was written there were abolitionists
[3:55:14.260 --> 3:55:21.300]  in every state some states had slavery some didn't the only way they could have a a unified 13 colony
[3:55:21.300 --> 3:55:28.820]  united states of america was to allow slavery at least for the time being but it was always known
[3:55:28.820 --> 3:55:35.220]  that slavery eventually was going to be abolished that's why it was written all men are created
[3:55:35.220 --> 3:55:43.140]  equal so slavery predated europeans getting to getting to america remember the aztecs and the you
[3:55:43.140 --> 3:55:48.660]  know the the blue people getting dragged up the pyramids and beheaded and their hearts chopped out
[3:55:48.660 --> 3:55:55.540]  they were slaves so that the europeans didn't invent it they inherited it from the islamic
[3:55:55.540 --> 3:56:02.820]  conquest of spain and then christian christians on both sides of the atlantic were the ones who
[3:56:02.820 --> 3:56:08.660]  abolished it not the muslims in the islamic world not until they were forced to get rid of it on the
[3:56:08.660 --> 3:56:16.020]  surface in the 20th century but it was william wilberforce you know a british member of parliament
[3:56:16.020 --> 3:56:23.780]  and then later abraham lincoln in america who actually abolished slavery and as far as reparations go
[3:56:24.660 --> 3:56:32.020]  620 000 union soldiers died in the civil war you can argue about all the causes and consequences
[3:56:32.020 --> 3:56:40.100]  of the civil war but for sure a big part of it was ending slavery 620 000 union dead is a hell of a
[3:56:40.100 --> 3:56:46.420]  debt to be to pay and in terms of the population of the of the union at the time which was only
[3:56:46.420 --> 3:56:52.420]  22 million that would be the if there was an american civil war today that would be like
[3:56:52.420 --> 3:57:00.740]  six million american soldiers dying in a civil war to abolish slavery that was the cons that was
[3:57:00.740 --> 3:57:08.100]  the enormity of that sacrifice in the 1860s so please reject this false narrative that's being
[3:57:08.100 --> 3:57:14.660]  pushed by the liberals that trump is like the head of the new clan and all white people carry some
[3:57:14.660 --> 3:57:23.460]  evil original sin of being like the inventors and and the proponents of slavery it's a lie and we
[3:57:23.460 --> 3:57:29.060]  need to push back against it you know this is going to be the big false narrative of the next
[3:57:29.060 --> 3:57:36.100]  uh 18 months and we have to start pushing back against it now this is matt bracken and i'll see
[3:57:36.100 --> 3:58:00.020]  you next thursday uh if everything goes well and i'm still here
