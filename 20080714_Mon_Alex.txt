[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[00:05.000 --> 00:09.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:09.000 --> 00:33.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:33.000 --> 01:02.000]  Music plays.
[01:02.000 --> 01:31.000]  Music plays.
[01:31.000 --> 02:00.000]  Music plays.
[02:00.000 --> 02:29.000]  Music plays.
[02:29.000 --> 02:38.000]  Music plays.
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.000]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are here live.
[02:43.000 --> 02:49.000]  It is Monday, already the 14th day of July 2008.
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  We're going to be here for the next three hours and 57 minutes.
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  Governor Jesse Ventura set to announce tonight, might even do it here on this show,
[02:59.000 --> 03:03.000]  whether he's going to run for the Senate, the U.S. Senate out of Minnesota.
[03:03.000 --> 03:07.000]  We'll be joining us coming up later in the broadcast.
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  And of course, one of our favorite financial analysts to track what's happening in the markets,
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  what's happening with all these bank problems and failures and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  He will be joining us for an hour and a half today as well.
[03:23.000 --> 03:32.000]  We have Bush saying that he supports Israel striking Iran, the strongest language yet.
[03:32.000 --> 03:40.000]  We have that unfolding as well, so we'll be breaking that down all of this vitally important news today
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  when we get back in the next segment.
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.000]  U.S. spells out Fannie Freddie Backstop Plan.
[03:49.000 --> 03:57.000]  Fed offers to lend to mortgage companies, Treasury plans, possibly equity investment.
[03:57.000 --> 04:03.000]  That means you are going to, quote, bail them out and they are further going to devalue the dollar.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  But they're not just going to rob you of the value of your dollar.
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  You are then going to have to pay taxes to pay that back.
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.000]  And that means they cop on every corner, white-loving you for speeding one mile over the speed limit.
[04:15.000 --> 04:21.000]  That means the federal CPS seizing children for no reason in sucking the money out of you.
[04:21.000 --> 04:29.000]  That means hundreds of new taxes, total regulation control, a nightmare of scum ruling.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  So we'll break all of this down when we get back after this quick break.
[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000]  Big broadcasts lined up today.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  Call everybody you know.
[04:37.000 --> 04:44.000]  Tell them to tune in now because this is going to be a very important broadcast we have for you today.
[04:44.000 --> 04:48.000]  Please stay with us right here on the one and only GCN Radio Network.
[04:48.000 --> 04:52.000]  Be sure and check out the newly redesigned PrismPlanet.com.
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[04:57.000 --> 05:02.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[05:05.000 --> 05:08.000]  But their objective being world domination.
[05:08.000 --> 05:11.000]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[05:14.000 --> 05:21.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[05:21.000 --> 05:27.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress for the world government.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  They're after power. That's their affidavit.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  In game on DVD at prismplanet.com or infowars.com
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  or watch it online right now at prismplanet.tv.
[05:47.000 --> 06:10.000]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[06:10.000 --> 06:21.000]  What's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[06:21.000 --> 06:49.000]  What's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[06:49.000 --> 07:14.000]  What's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[07:14.000 --> 07:40.000]  What's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[07:40.000 --> 07:53.000]  What's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[07:53.000 --> 08:12.000]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:12.000 --> 08:25.000]  Every day, day in, day out.
[08:25.000 --> 08:35.000]  For a very long time, we have been here trying to warn people about what the globalists are up to,
[08:35.000 --> 08:40.000]  the different criminal actions of the New World Order that are being carried out.
[08:40.000 --> 08:42.000]  We have done our very best job to do this.
[08:42.000 --> 08:48.000]  You see, the private banks that own and run our country and most of the world's financial systems
[08:48.000 --> 08:54.000]  within countries are predatory and they want a world government ruled by central banks.
[08:54.000 --> 08:57.000]  You will buy your carbon credits from them.
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  They will decide through environmental laws and international bodies how many children you can have.
[09:02.000 --> 09:12.000]  You will be genetically tested. Genetics is the governing force in ideology that controls the elite cosmology
[09:12.000 --> 09:23.000]  that they are putting into place.
[09:23.000 --> 09:32.000]  We are here trying to rally the world to understand this. We are here doing the best job we can,
[09:32.000 --> 09:43.000]  attempting to get the people of the planet to think outside the box to question the official reality
[09:43.000 --> 09:49.000]  that is handed down to them so that we might rally together and stop the scientific architects
[09:49.000 --> 09:57.000]  of this worldwide enslavement grid that is being now activated.
[09:57.000 --> 10:01.000]  You give the central bankers the power to issue currency and credit and liquidity.
[10:01.000 --> 10:08.000]  They are going to enrich themselves. They are going to amass power unto themselves.
[10:08.000 --> 10:17.000]  The people are going to wake up enslaved on the continent that their forefathers opened up and established.
[10:17.000 --> 10:22.000]  The wealthiest nation in the world.
[10:22.000 --> 10:33.000]  Why do you have hundreds of third world countries that have per capita riches that are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 times
[10:33.000 --> 10:42.000]  the mineral resources, the growing resources with fertile lands and rich soils,
[10:42.000 --> 10:47.000]  but still the general public is an abject poverty.
[10:47.000 --> 10:53.000]  The countries are hell holes of kidnappings and crime and government corruption.
[10:53.000 --> 11:04.000]  South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, much of Asia, much of the Middle East,
[11:04.000 --> 11:12.000]  much of Eastern Europe, Central Europe, India.
[11:12.000 --> 11:21.000]  How can Mexico have conservatively, there's different gauges, have three times the mineral assets of the United States
[11:21.000 --> 11:28.000]  and have fertile growing areas equal to the United States, though it's a smaller nation.
[11:28.000 --> 11:36.000]  How can they be one of the poorest in the world? Because they have a corrupt elite that made the decision centuries ago
[11:36.000 --> 11:44.000]  to not allow a middle class to form, to not allow a true free market, though it would impoverish their country
[11:44.000 --> 11:52.000]  and make it a very dark place economically, socially, it would allow the elites to maintain control
[11:52.000 --> 12:01.000]  and economically through feudalism dominate their populations, and so Mexico has more billionaires than the United States.
[12:01.000 --> 12:07.000]  Mexico per capita has more billionaires than any other country in the world.
[12:07.000 --> 12:16.000]  Mexico is one of the most corrupt regimes on the planet, but there's a long list of corrupt regimes that all basically run off the same system.
[12:16.000 --> 12:23.000]  One of the more extreme examples, one of the only that is more extreme than Mexico is North Korea.
[12:23.000 --> 12:35.000]  Shopping malls, movie theaters, the secret police living in marble tiled homes with the finest luxuries,
[12:35.000 --> 12:39.000]  dwarfing any government standard of living in the world.
[12:39.000 --> 12:49.000]  But right outside tiny controlled government sectors or green zones, you have people living off of dead humans,
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.000]  people that starved to death or killed in the death camps where millions have been killed just in the last decade admittedly.
[12:55.000 --> 13:07.000]  Human flash, according to Vanity Fair, is sold on the streets of their capital, Longham,
[13:07.000 --> 13:18.000]  and most of their industry is slave labor camps, and still they're falling apart.
[13:18.000 --> 13:25.000]  The people are completely brainwashed into a 1984 system chanting and worshiping and loving their masters.
[13:25.000 --> 13:31.000]  When U.S. aid groups and other spies are able to get in and even try to talk to people in death camps,
[13:31.000 --> 13:38.000]  they believe it's their lot to be in the death camp, and most of them want to die, and they die worshipping Kim Jong-il.
[13:38.000 --> 13:43.000]  And believing there's a 30% of the American people that would do the same thing.
[13:43.000 --> 13:51.000]  I mean, if you took a decadent yuppie like a Gordon lawyer, you know, that type of low level,
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  I use him as the archetypal person in denial, thinking they're a conservative when they're not.
[13:55.000 --> 14:01.000]  If you took a type like that and put them in a new role or death camp, they would thank the guards
[14:01.000 --> 14:08.000]  and would say that they had done wrong, they had been bad, they would agree with it.
[14:08.000 --> 14:13.000]  But 70% or more of us are awake and have woken up to the false left-right paradigm.
[14:13.000 --> 14:19.000]  In fact, some could say more with Congress, both parties universally hated now, with only a 9% approval rating.
[14:19.000 --> 14:25.000]  But even though the public has some idea they've been lied to and now has finally figured out that there's major corruption
[14:25.000 --> 14:34.000]  that has taken hold of our society,
[14:34.000 --> 14:42.000]  they don't have the full scope or even an inkling of the full scope of just how dire our strates are
[14:42.000 --> 14:51.000]  and just how bad our future prospects are if we don't have a total awakening, a fiery awakening
[14:51.000 --> 14:59.000]  with people on the streets screaming and yelling and holding up signs and plastering anti-New World Order stickers
[14:59.000 --> 15:04.000]  and pro-liberty stickers and freedom messages everywhere.
[15:04.000 --> 15:12.000]  If your neighbors and your neighborhoods, I mean, we have no chance if, as a case point example, all of my listeners
[15:12.000 --> 15:22.000]  don't buy DVD duplicators and make copies hundreds a week of Terror Storm and in-game and films like Truth Rising
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  and those are the most effective films.
[15:24.000 --> 15:32.000]  And if your neighborhood isn't knee-deep in those and if you don't knock on the door and beg them to watch it as well,
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  that means not going and seeing your girlfriend tonight or getting her to go with you.
[15:35.000 --> 15:38.000]  That means not going and seeing your boyfriend tonight or getting them to go with you.
[15:38.000 --> 15:46.000]  That means going and if you have to buy a hand printing press and cranking out copies or a computer
[15:46.000 --> 15:56.000]  or selling all that junk you've got in your garage and on eBay now and going and paying to have broadsheets made
[15:56.000 --> 16:02.000]  that are only about 15 cents a piece at Kinko's, now FedEx Kinko's, with whatever message you think's important
[16:02.000 --> 16:05.000]  and putting them out and giving people websites.
[16:05.000 --> 16:15.000]  I mean, this is the time to put out the maximum effort against the New World Order because their jaws are closing on us right now.
[16:15.000 --> 16:23.000]  Their final trap of economic implosion while the establishment poses as the saviors bringing you into a military state,
[16:23.000 --> 16:34.000]  it is happening right now, it is unfolding now, it is developing right now.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  Have you noticed that everything we talk about happens?
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  Have you noticed that everything we discuss in the order we say it's going to happen happens?
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  Do you know why that is?
[16:43.000 --> 16:46.000]  That is because we have the IMF and World Bank documents.
[16:46.000 --> 16:50.000]  We have the Council on Foreign Relations documents.
[16:50.000 --> 16:55.000]  We know what the globalists are planning and what they're saying and what they're doing.
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.000]  They don't want a free market.
[16:57.000 --> 16:59.000]  They don't want a good economy.
[16:59.000 --> 17:01.000]  They don't want you to be free.
[17:01.000 --> 17:03.000]  They don't want you to have a good life.
[17:03.000 --> 17:07.000]  Now, let me break down the basics of what we're facing right now.
[17:07.000 --> 17:21.000]  Even though for people who have common sense tend to imagine that the elites have that same common sense or governed by sanity or governed by some type of rule of law,
[17:21.000 --> 17:28.000]  we have to get our minds outside of our own mindsets and realize the enemy's pathology and their history.
[17:28.000 --> 17:37.000]  They need to attack Iran so the people will rally around the central government and the private corporate interest.
[17:37.000 --> 17:45.000]  While they target their real enemy, the people of the West, the people of Canada, the United States, and Europe, and England.
[17:45.000 --> 17:52.000]  The final resting place of some liberty and some private independent capital that might threaten the elite.
[17:52.000 --> 18:01.000]  If they can get us out of the way by getting us to rally around during World War III, they can then blame the economic collapse on World War III.
[18:01.000 --> 18:11.000]  Even though they institute it, people will still have a tendency to rally around, at least for a short time, as a smoke screen for the globalists to put martial law in in the Western world.
[18:11.000 --> 18:24.000]  You can see all the preparations for that, a type of soft martial law going into a more intense martial law with checkpoints and papers and no fourth amendment and scanning cameras everywhere.
[18:24.000 --> 18:35.000]  They need our acquiescence at this key point, and they need the security forces and the military forces to be conditioned enough to accept mercenary forces.
[18:35.000 --> 18:52.000]  Blackwater is now converting mainly into foreign troops from Argentina, from Venezuela, from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic, Ukrainian, Mexican.
[18:52.000 --> 18:59.000]  The military is converting to felons and foreigners. I mean, it's happening. Look it up if you didn't know that.
[18:59.000 --> 19:07.000]  And they've just got to have the military stand down. The police go along with it just long enough for the final conversion to take place.
[19:07.000 --> 19:15.000]  And then they can start the mass arrests, the pickups, the shutting down of the free internet. You understand? That's why I'm so upset.
[19:15.000 --> 19:25.000]  We knew they were going to do all this, but to see them continue down the path, to see them continue dotting every eye, crossing every team,
[19:25.000 --> 19:38.000]  to know that they really are planning on bringing us into this hot war while the American people rally around the establishment because we're in a premeditated war against the people of Iran.
[19:38.000 --> 19:52.000]  We'll come back, cover the Iran news, then get into the financial news. These are the times that try men's souls. We are here on the eve of World War III.
[19:52.000 --> 20:00.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-Eleven was an inside job.
[20:00.000 --> 20:03.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[20:03.000 --> 20:10.000]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage? Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF?
[20:10.000 --> 20:19.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[20:19.000 --> 20:24.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[20:24.000 --> 20:29.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[20:29.000 --> 20:35.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[20:35.000 --> 20:44.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue, and if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.

[20:49.000 --> 20:52.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[20:52.000 --> 21:01.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[21:01.000 --> 21:12.000]  That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986, yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[21:12.000 --> 21:20.000]  The truth be told, gold and silver is outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[21:20.000 --> 21:26.000]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[21:26.000 --> 21:32.000]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[21:32.000 --> 21:36.000]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[21:36.000 --> 21:45.000]  Call 800-686-2237. Make sure that you secure your future. Call 800-686-2237.

[24:22.000 --> 24:30.000]  Alright, we're back live my friends. Thank you for joining us today.
[24:30.000 --> 24:57.000]  The New World Order is so transparently evil, so transparently corrupt that if we only stand up against them and speak out against them now, then flood the alternative media and reach out to people on every mainstream chat room and go to every city council meeting and speak out against the war and against the devaluation of the dollar.
[24:57.000 --> 25:10.000]  We can force the real issues into the public consciousness. The general public already hates the establishment already distrust them with a little bit of information that they know.
[25:10.000 --> 25:24.000]  Once they are aware of the larger picture and have an idea of the true scope of their betrayal, we will be able to bring the establishment to justice.
[25:24.000 --> 25:28.000]  And they know that. That's why they've gone to the point of no return.
[25:28.000 --> 25:39.000]  It is martial law when the Constitution is violated and the borders are left wide open despite the fact that 90 plus percent of Americans and major polls want them controlled.
[25:39.000 --> 25:44.000]  It is martial law when the government does what it wants, when it wants, how it wants.
[25:44.000 --> 25:54.000]  It is martial law when the government does chemical and biological and radiological testing on the American people as they are admittedly currently doing. That is criminal.
[25:54.000 --> 26:03.000]  But they would say no. We are under martial law, so we are in control. It is martial law when the Congress for close to a year.
[26:03.000 --> 26:23.000]  It's been 11 months since the Homeland Security Chairman asked for the full text of the secret PDD 51. The cover cheat says the President is a dictator and the John Warner Defense Authorization Act says that he will wage war against the American people and that we are enemies of the state and basically rebels.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  Go read it for yourself.
[26:25.000 --> 26:38.000]  But now, almost a year later, Congress is still not allowed to see it and the White House is being subpoenaed over this, but the White House has been subpoenaed in proceedings in Congress and Carl Rowe fled the country.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  He is now under indictment.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  Did you see that on the nightly news?
[26:42.000 --> 26:55.000]  Nowhere but on Countdown with Keith Oberman, but then he makes it all a left-right paradigm. No, the truth is the left is going along with all of this, just like the right is going along with it together.
[26:55.000 --> 27:07.000]  Under orders of the globalists that know where all the skeletons are hidden, who blackmail and intimidate and also control and buy off and steer the Congress.
[27:07.000 --> 27:18.000]  And so when the people say we don't want warrantless checkpoints and the feds fund the local police to do it, that is federalization and martial law.
[27:18.000 --> 27:27.000]  When CPS take more than a million children a year without warrants, without judges, without juries, with no due process, that is martial law.
[27:27.000 --> 27:37.000]  When the IRS takes millions of people's bank accounts and garnishes them without a judge, without a jury, without an indictment, without an arrest, they just do it, that is martial law.
[27:37.000 --> 27:47.000]  We have been in the beginning degrees of martial law, but now we're going to go into a hotter martial law if they attack Iran.
[27:47.000 --> 28:00.000]  Now, the Harats and the Jerusalem Post both reported last week that the Israeli Air Force confirmed they are running aircraft F-15s, F-16s, and the Eagle variant out of Iraq by the hundreds.
[28:00.000 --> 28:02.000]  They are preparing to hit Iraq.
[28:02.000 --> 28:05.000]  They have said that the White House has authorized them to hit.
[28:05.000 --> 28:09.000]  If Iraq fights Iran, they have planes in Iraq.
[28:09.000 --> 28:21.000]  If Iran fights back in any way with White House authorization, Israel says they have White House authorization to attack Iran out of Iraq.
[28:21.000 --> 28:38.000]  If Iran fights back in any way, they have been told that they will be hit by the United States and that the United States will probably use nuclear weapons.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  Think about that.
[28:40.000 --> 28:48.000]  Our surrogate, Israel, is going to attack you and if you fight back in any way, that is going to be called terrorism.
[28:48.000 --> 29:02.000]  If you fire back in any way or do anything in your own waters to block the shipping, if you do anything to fire your outdated scuds at Israel, if you do anything, you will be attacked.
[29:02.000 --> 29:09.000]  And the brainwashed American people, some of them will at least support it, but it doesn't matter if that 25-30% supports it.
[29:09.000 --> 29:18.000]  These little neocon followers think they are running the country and they are having their way and they laugh at people on air and say, it doesn't matter what you want, we are going to attack Iran.
[29:18.000 --> 29:27.000]  When they have no idea that it is going to quadruple gas prices and destroy our economy, which is exactly what the big central banks want.
[29:27.000 --> 29:39.000]  We are going to come back, get more into the Iran situation, the economy, and then of course we are steaming towards an interview with Governor Jesse Ventura on the eve of announcing his run for the Senate.

[30:53.000 --> 31:04.000]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain, I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seems so difficult.
[31:04.000 --> 31:14.000]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[31:14.000 --> 31:23.000]  Now that's something I can handle. The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options and helped me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[31:23.000 --> 31:34.000]  I used my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water, I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great.

[32:50.000 --> 33:05.000]  Join the info war today.
[33:20.000 --> 33:29.000]  I want to be very succinct for all the listeners out there.
[33:29.000 --> 33:41.000]  You know what's going on. You understand what's happening. You're a very important brain trust. Your neighbors know the government's corrupt and evil. They know it's lying.
[33:41.000 --> 33:53.000]  The establishment liked to act like America was free and happy and great and none of your rights were violated as they were setting up their tyranny in the last couple of decades.
[33:53.000 --> 34:01.000]  But now they want you to know you're being spied on. Now they want the police to wear black ski mask and black helmets to intimidate you and police chiefs admit it.
[34:01.000 --> 34:12.000]  Now they want to scare the public into submission. They would have rather had everybody just happy, happy, joy, joy, have no idea what was going on, still mindlessly trusting the government.
[34:12.000 --> 34:19.000]  I mean as much as we criticize the general population and bemoan how dumb down they are, they are waking up.
[34:19.000 --> 34:32.000]  So now the establishment is trying to intimidate everyone as best they can.
[34:32.000 --> 34:39.000]  That is trying to intimidate those that know what's going on. I mean to people who are informed and know some history and the basics.
[34:39.000 --> 34:52.000]  Hearing a government talk about torture and the torture of children and warrantless wiretapping and FEMA camps for American citizens and every talking head talking about putting Americans that disagree with the government in labor camps.
[34:52.000 --> 34:59.000]  That's a huge chilling effect or an attempt at a chilling effect against those that are in the know and those that are waking up.
[34:59.000 --> 35:12.000]  But for dumbbells there is a bathing in the tyranny and they psychologically are then acclimated to that because they have no benchmark of tyranny versus liberty and so they just begin to think that that's their right.
[35:12.000 --> 35:20.000]  It's their right to be tasered for no reason. It's their right to go to prison for no reason. It's their right to have no due process.
[35:20.000 --> 35:32.000]  It's their right to have face scanning cameras tracking them and cameras scanning their license plates. It's their right to be overrun with open borders and foreigners driving down wages paying for all of their health care.
[35:32.000 --> 35:37.000]  It is their right to be a slave.
[35:37.000 --> 35:48.000]  And we have a small window now while a large majority of the public is finally starting to get spooked to go and now explain to them.
[35:48.000 --> 35:56.000]  I mean everybody's asking why why why is the why is gas so expensive. Why is food prices going up.
[35:56.000 --> 36:08.000]  Why are food prices going up and none of them know you have to go to them explain the government with the private Federal Reserve made the decision to devalue the currency.
[36:08.000 --> 36:20.000]  We have to put pressure on the central government to reverse those policies raise interest rates moderately would do it.
[36:20.000 --> 36:28.000]  That would just signal that the government isn't abandoning the dollar. Latin America Europe the Middle East Asia have been begging for five years to sure it up.
[36:28.000 --> 36:40.000]  They for a while they were trying to buy it to sure it up. But the European elite and the U.S. elite the Anglo-American elite the Rothschild elite decided and made the decision to devalue.
[36:40.000 --> 36:47.000]  And so the world kept saying no no no we're holding your dollars please don't cause a worldwide depression.
[36:47.000 --> 36:55.000]  That's smaller elites the smaller sovereign wealth funds and groups and now they said OK you're going to abandon it OK we'll start dumping.
[36:55.000 --> 37:05.000]  And they're very upset about it it's hurting them so they're rushing into commodities to try to protect themselves.
[37:05.000 --> 37:14.000]  In a way I'm trying to wake up the main line public but no way it's kind of good for those of us who are here in the U.S.
[37:14.000 --> 37:26.000]  who are middle class that the yuppies and the know-it-alls haven't discovered what's happened to the dollar yet because that wouldn't give us time to try to protect ourselves at least to some extent.
[37:26.000 --> 37:33.000]  I mean I'm so busy working six seven days a week that I haven't had time to get myself prepared.
[37:33.000 --> 37:39.000]  I probably be taking some days off the next few weeks just to do that because I can't wait anymore.
[37:39.000 --> 38:01.000]  Things have deteriorated to the point where this weekend you know I was up late at night every night studying the real financial numbers and check in with the other experts are saying and I mean I've got a chill in my bones and a great frustration that I don't have a big enough bull horn a big enough bully pulpit to reach these people.
[38:01.000 --> 38:09.000]  I mean I want to reach people. It's not funny to me that the public have been completely dumbed down.
[38:09.000 --> 38:23.000]  Well dumbed down means they were once smart. A lot of people from were raised by television and their diapers and are listening to me right now and they've been trained that anytime they're faced with any type of crisis they just make excuses and laugh and rationalize.
[38:23.000 --> 38:33.000]  So there are tens of thousands of people listening all over the country right now who are tuning in for the first time. We're on a lot of FM stations. People are tuning in every second and they're just laughing right now.
[38:33.000 --> 38:45.000]  I mean they are preconditioned where they can't even understand me and it's very sad to me. It's very upsetting to me.
[38:45.000 --> 38:54.000]  So let me just give you some of the financial news here and then we'll get back into Iran.
[38:54.000 --> 39:08.000]  U.S. spells out Fannie Freddie backstop plan and they're talking about hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billion more of your tax money that has huge debt attached to it.
[39:08.000 --> 39:15.000]  You just don't pay for it. You're paying through debt through a credit card that's on your head and your children's heads. But forget your children.
[39:15.000 --> 39:24.000]  We always said our children's futures will be ruined by all the spending. Well you don't have to wait for your kids. You don't care about them. It's going to hurt you.
[39:24.000 --> 39:32.000]  U.S. spells out Fannie Freddie backstop plan. The Federal Reserve and the Treasury announced steps Sunday to shore up mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
[39:32.000 --> 39:38.000]  The plunge protection team. The working group of financial markets in the White House by the way is dumping hundreds of billions in today.
[39:38.000 --> 39:47.000]  That's the only reason the market stabilized somewhat whose shares have plunged as losses from their mortgage holdings threatened their financial survival.
[39:47.000 --> 39:55.000]  Now remember six months ago when all the politicians came out and said shut up out there. Don't you dare say the banking system is in trouble.
[39:55.000 --> 40:04.000]  Everything's wonderful. We've seen the end of brokerage funds and banks going under with country wide and a few others.
[40:04.000 --> 40:14.000]  And it's anybody that tells you that we're going to have further bank failures or further lender failures or further brokerage house failures.
[40:14.000 --> 40:22.000]  I heard the word conspiracy theorist. And hey you tell the public that it's like drinking a gallon of Jack Daniels and taking 14 volume.
[40:22.000 --> 40:31.000]  They just pass out. Your house could be on fire and you could walk up to somebody's house on fire and say it's a conspiracy theory that houses on fire.
[40:31.000 --> 40:39.000]  And most Americans will walk back in and catch on fire and burn up with flames. I'm almost serious. They are hypnotized folks.
[40:39.000 --> 40:48.000]  You tell them hey the dollars just fine. It's a conspiracy theory that it's going down. I see that all over the web and they say hey my dollars fine.
[40:48.000 --> 41:01.000]  I saw that idiot Gordon Boyer. I know I'm building him up bigger than he is. Nobody knows who he is. He's just the archetypal example of an idiot.
[41:01.000 --> 41:12.000]  I mean he goes around doing pieces about how the dollar is strong. I just and I know he's really not stupid. He thinks that's going to bolster it putting out bull.
[41:12.000 --> 41:25.000]  No admitting that the policies are killing the dollar and getting the policies changed. Do you understand you little twits out there that think you're members of the establishment that you're not?
[41:25.000 --> 41:38.000]  Don't you understand that when our troops are ordered to torture Iraqis that then that ruins our name worldwide and then what comes around goes around that if we allow bad things like that to happen
[41:38.000 --> 41:50.000]  that it ends up coming back on us. You think the people running our government will bankrupt hundreds of third world countries and put dictators in that carry out black ops and torture
[41:50.000 --> 41:59.000]  but then they wouldn't do that here. They'll put dictators in all over the world. They'll work with socialists, communists, fascists. They don't care.
[41:59.000 --> 42:12.000]  That's the Georgetown histories of the elite show under Carl Quigley, Professor Carl Quigley. And you don't think they want to do that here when they're carrying out the exact same operation they've carried out in other third world countries hundreds of times.
[42:12.000 --> 42:19.000]  So we'll get more into this later with Bob Chapman coming up for an hour and a half today.
[42:19.000 --> 42:30.000]  Venezuela Chavez says oil could reach 300 a barrel. Well, Goldman Sachs and others are saying 200 conservatively in the fall.
[42:30.000 --> 42:48.000]  Morgan's Giants collapse could herald 1930s depression. Paul Watson for prisonplanet.com did a great roundup article that has scores of links to it and key quotes. You can read 20, 30 stories trying to get the news. You could read this one. Very important. I'm going to read that in its entirety later if we have time.
[42:48.000 --> 42:56.000]  We also have a link to Kit Co with commodities are strong but which ones are stronger. I want to go into which commodities are the strongest right now.
[42:56.000 --> 43:01.000]  Here's another one of international Herald Tribune a new American reality the government is provider.
[43:01.000 --> 43:06.000]  But see the international Herald Tribune gets it wrong the Federal Reserve is not the provider.
[43:06.000 --> 43:13.000]  But in a way it's true the private Federal Reserve is becoming government.
[43:13.000 --> 43:26.000]  But in the strictest terms this headlines wrong it should read private Federal Reserve becoming the government loan sharking the public into even deeper unescapable debt.
[43:26.000 --> 43:42.000]  But see Rush Limbaugh for 15 20 years is told neocon listeners as he slowly twisted them to the dark side that it's Federal Reserve isn't private it's loving it's wonderful there's no corruption and so they can't wake up to that.
[43:42.000 --> 44:01.000]  SEC to probe manipulation through false information Bloomberg Wall Street's biggest regulators are examining whether securities firms adequately police rumor mongering to manipulate stocks after shares of women brothers holdings Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac tumbled last week.
[44:01.000 --> 44:19.000]  What the government wants to do now is restrict your free speech. We had seen in the Mac for at least eight months with people not being able to get their money out people would try to direct hundreds of thousands of dollars out of the bank and the bank would hold it up for weeks or months.
[44:19.000 --> 44:32.000]  And then the last month since mid June people weren't able to get their full deposits out they couldn't even get cashier checks out. And so the government saying as much as I hate him.
[44:32.000 --> 44:40.000]  That Chucky Schumer shouldn't be allowed to write letters because he's on the banking committee and how dare him write a letter saying people deserve their money out.
[44:40.000 --> 44:54.000]  You see oh Indy Mac was just fine. I remember telling people how banks keep about 3% reserves towards what they claim and Fiat assets and currency.
[44:54.000 --> 45:03.000]  What's on the books. They'll tell you that's a conspiracy theory. No that's a fact 3% is a high level of reserve.
[45:03.000 --> 45:18.000]  If you've got $100 in your local bank on average they got $3 in cash and they're leveraged out on average 10 times even what they've got in digital currency.
[45:18.000 --> 45:29.000]  That means you walk in and say I want a cashier's check for $50,000 what I've got in the savings account for my 10 year old son. Hypothetical.
[45:29.000 --> 45:37.000]  And Indy Mac would say sorry we can give you $10,000 a week maybe. That's a cashier's check. You're going to take that to another bank.
[45:37.000 --> 45:45.000]  You're trying to transfer that money. They won't even wire that $50,000. You understand?
[45:45.000 --> 45:58.000]  And so the feds want to say you're not allowed to come on the radio or TV and say run for the hills like Kramer was saying last Friday saying we're going into a depression.
[45:58.000 --> 46:02.000]  The oil brings Americans closer to OPEC debtor dependence.
[46:02.000 --> 46:11.000]  Petroleum exporting nations from Saudi Arabia to Russia are not only charging America's record high prices for fuel they are also poised to become the biggest creditor to the U.S. government.
[46:11.000 --> 46:22.000]  Holdings of treasuries by oil producers and extension and institutions such as U.K. banks as proxies for Middle East nations rose 44% to $510.8 billion through April.
[46:22.000 --> 46:31.000]  Four times faster than the rest of the world.
[46:31.000 --> 46:48.000]  Meanwhile our criminal government will not allow us to drill in Alaska. Bush could have years ago allowed drilling and they're only allowing it in small areas of the Gulf.
[46:48.000 --> 46:53.000]  I've got all this other news.
[46:53.000 --> 47:02.000]  I said yesterday that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had lost 75% of their value in the last eight months.
[47:02.000 --> 47:08.000]  I was wrong. Last night it was reported because I was looking at numbers from a few days before.
[47:08.000 --> 47:20.000]  It has lost 80 plus percent. I saw one number of 85 on AFP French news agency. I saw another one on Bloomberg of 87.
[47:20.000 --> 47:29.000]  The point is you have institutions that are leveraged in the thousands of trillions with 50.5 trillion on their current books.
[47:29.000 --> 47:36.000]  50.5 trillion. The entire economy every year is 3 trillion.
[47:36.000 --> 47:46.000]  50.5 trillion leveraged into the thousands of trillions. Those two institutions alone.
[47:46.000 --> 47:52.000]  Thousands of trillions.
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.000]  Thousands of trillions.
[47:55.000 --> 48:06.000]  That right there is many times more fee hot imaginary wealth than all the real assets in the world valued at current rates.
[48:06.000 --> 48:10.000]  The bankers created unlimited money to destroy us.
[48:10.000 --> 48:20.000]  They're in all the real assets and they leave us holding the bag and the average person on the street has no idea what is even going on.
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.000]  The politicians, just like they told you eight months ago, are telling you everything is fine.
[48:25.000 --> 48:32.000]  Just like they told you six months ago, the worst is over and they're telling you the same thing again as we go straight down.
[48:32.000 --> 48:39.000]  By the way, I don't agree with Bob Chapman and Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and the head of the New York Business School and Joseph Stiglitz.
[48:39.000 --> 48:52.000]  They all say two and a half to three years so we're in a total running man slash death race 2000 slash road warrior scenario.
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  The way this is unraveling, I see that in a year and a half.
[48:56.000 --> 48:59.000]  Now they're the experts. They've been right in the past. I hope they're right.
[48:59.000 --> 49:06.000]  I hope we got two and a half years to somehow, those of us in the know, get ready for this.
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.000]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up and yes, I'm going to pitch gold at you.
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  It supports the network. It supports the show, but I'm going to be frank with you.
[49:14.000 --> 49:17.000]  The deal he offered over the weekend, I talked to him this morning, Ted lost money on that.
[49:17.000 --> 49:24.000]  He was selling gold at $926 an ounce. That means per coin, that's what he was buying it for,
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.000]  added the shipping to get it into his vault and then the 2% or so for his brokers.
[49:29.000 --> 49:36.000]  It was to be a loss leader. Well, he lost money on that through the order Sunday because you took advantage of it.
[49:36.000 --> 49:39.000]  It's now, what is it right now, Ted? It's shooting straight up.
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  Yeah, gold's up over 970. It's up to 97370 last time I checked.
[49:44.000 --> 49:49.000]  You know, you asked me, do I think gold is going to hit $1,000 an ounce or when do I think it's going to happen?
[49:49.000 --> 49:54.000]  I said August, I'm going to revise that. It could happen today. It's going up that fast.
[49:54.000 --> 49:59.000]  I can't believe it. This is July and usually gold is real soft and real flat in July and I'm like,
[49:59.000 --> 50:06.000]  I better be conservative $1,000 an ounce. I'm guessing it'll happen. It'll happen this fall, but it's happening this summer.
[50:06.000 --> 50:11.000]  And then here we have this bank, Indie Mac closing in the Federal Reserve System stepping in,
[50:11.000 --> 50:15.000]  which just means basically they're printing more money to solve the problems,
[50:15.000 --> 50:21.000]  which is going to take value away from everybody. And then you look at the headlines over at the Herald Tribune.
[50:21.000 --> 50:25.000]  And they're saying 150 banks are going to fail before the end of this year.
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.000]  I mean, Alex, that's crazy. I can't believe the market that we're in this.
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  And if they're saying that, more like 500 banks are going to fail.
[50:33.000 --> 50:39.000]  And folks, they're telling people at Indie Mac, if they had over 100 grand, they're saying you're never getting your money.
[50:39.000 --> 50:43.000]  You understand? You're not going to get your money. Ted, stay there.
[50:43.000 --> 50:49.000]  You were just down in Buenos Aires, Argentina. They wouldn't even take dollars down there. You had to push them on them.

[52:47.000 --> 52:52.000]  American Free Press, the voice of the Second American Revolution.
[52:52.000 --> 52:58.000]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  and we knew what to do.
[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  Or at least we thought we did.
[53:02.000 --> 53:08.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[53:08.000 --> 53:17.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the AT, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[53:17.000 --> 53:24.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[53:24.000 --> 53:28.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[53:28.000 --> 53:33.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[53:33.000 --> 53:40.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[53:40.000 --> 53:45.000]  and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[53:45.000 --> 54:04.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[54:04.000 --> 54:11.000]  My friends, elites throughout history have launched wars that have in some cases killed entire cities.
[54:11.000 --> 54:15.000]  With the Romans, the Babylonians, and others.
[54:15.000 --> 54:21.000]  Because powerful men wanted more power and more control.
[54:21.000 --> 54:28.000]  Imagine being a Julius Caesar and looking out on the horizons of Germany at the Misty horizon
[54:28.000 --> 54:38.000]  or looking across the English Channel and at it all beyond and wanting to go in and conquer unknown savages.
[54:38.000 --> 54:41.000]  And that's what they were at the time.
[54:41.000 --> 54:47.000]  Why? Because they had an instinct to dominate and to push and to be aggressive.
[54:47.000 --> 54:53.000]  They had limitless egos and those of us that don't have that drive or power and control,
[54:53.000 --> 54:58.000]  we don't have the incentive or the propulsion system psychologically that the elites have.
[54:58.000 --> 55:00.000]  That's why they're always in control.
[55:00.000 --> 55:05.000]  That's why bad people are always in control because they've got the will to work that hard.
[55:05.000 --> 55:09.000]  Well, we have to work that hard just to survive and not be enslaved.
[55:09.000 --> 55:14.000]  And they're waging economic warfare on us by design right now.
[55:14.000 --> 55:17.000]  Ted Anderson back in the studio.
[55:17.000 --> 55:23.000]  Ted, I know you're not pleased, we talked this morning, by being proven right and gold up,
[55:23.000 --> 55:30.000]  what, $100 in the last month, $20-something bucks today, $20-something Friday.
[55:30.000 --> 55:34.000]  It should be a $2,000 plus with dollar devaluation.
[55:34.000 --> 55:39.000]  This is scary stuff, but people can, who are listeners, get the great Franks,
[55:39.000 --> 55:42.000]  the European Franks and the British Sovereigns.
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.000]  And a few months ago, you ran out of silver, you've got some now.
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  And no doubt, we're going to get to the point of this continues,
[55:47.000 --> 55:50.000]  where Ted's not going to have gold all the time for you folks.
[55:50.000 --> 55:51.000]  Ted?
[55:51.000 --> 55:52.000]  Well, that's true.
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  As a matter of fact, just a short time ago, silver, I couldn't get that.
[55:54.000 --> 55:57.000]  I mean, it's up over $19 an ounce right now.
[55:57.000 --> 56:01.000]  And this is what, we were at 16 here last week when I was talking to you.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  I do have some of those roles of walking liberties.
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  I couldn't get those bags here a while ago.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  I'm glad to have them now.
[56:09.000 --> 56:12.000]  It's probably because it's July and we have a little bit of a slowdown.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  I shouldn't even say that because we don't have a slowdown.
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  I've got people wanting it and we're filling the orders,
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  but I don't think I'm going to be able to have silver to offer here this fall.
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  I mean, it's crazy.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  I'm not expecting this in July.
[56:25.000 --> 56:28.000]  I'm expecting this in August, September, October.
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  That's how it always usually comes.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  To survive in a market just fine.
[56:32.000 --> 56:36.000]  I don't need to have an economic depression in order to stay in business.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  And this is way, you know, I'm concerned about the people of the United States of America.
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  I was just down in Argentina.
[56:42.000 --> 56:46.000]  I saw families with little kids sleeping in doorways with blankets over them.
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  I mean, it breaks your heart to see that,
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  but that's what we're looking at here in the United States
[56:50.000 --> 56:53.000]  because the same issues that they have to deal with, the banks collapsing.
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  And by the way, there was the old saying as rich as in Argentina,
[56:56.000 --> 57:00.000]  I mean overnight the globalists devalued their currency in 2000
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  and they went from being as wealthy as we are
[57:02.000 --> 57:08.000]  to literally the entire population, 99% living at total third world level.
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  Tell them about the coin offers.
[57:10.000 --> 57:11.000]  Give them the number, Ted.
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  Yeah, right now we do have the silver coins that I was talking about.
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  They are currently right now at the price of at 202 per roll of 20.
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  And I also have the British sovereign.
[57:22.000 --> 57:23.000]  It's at 286.
[57:23.000 --> 57:26.000]  My new Alex, I locked all of this in this morning at 960.
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  Gold is now over 973.
[57:28.000 --> 57:31.000]  Silver was in the $18 range.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  Now it's 19.
[57:32.000 --> 57:33.000]  All that stuff is going up again.
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  I'm glad I was able to get this.
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.000]  I hope people wake up.
[57:36.000 --> 57:40.000]  They can call us at 1-800-686-2237.
[57:40.000 --> 57:41.000]  I didn't add the Franks in there.
[57:41.000 --> 57:42.000]  They're at 212.
[57:42.000 --> 57:47.000]  Again, that's 1-800-686-2237.
[57:47.000 --> 57:50.000]  There's enough information out there for people to wake up now.
[57:50.000 --> 57:51.000]  Just take a look at it.
[57:51.000 --> 57:52.000]  And, Chad, I want to be clear.
[57:52.000 --> 57:55.000]  I want to be clear with people.
[57:55.000 --> 57:58.000]  Folks, it is only going up.
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  And I told you it was going to go back up.
[58:00.000 --> 58:05.000]  And when it finally breaks through, we're talking thousands and thousands of dollars an ounce.
[58:05.000 --> 58:10.000]  Give Ted a call, 800-686-2237.
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  And tell him it's the Alex Jones special.
[58:12.000 --> 58:16.000]  Or when you call, they're going to try to charge you the current rate.
[58:16.000 --> 58:18.000]  You've got to tell him it's the Alex Jones show you heard it on.
[58:18.000 --> 58:24.000]  So you get it at, what, 15 plus dollars cheaper than it actually is right now per ounce,
[58:24.000 --> 58:25.000]  either gold or silver.
[58:25.000 --> 58:29.000]  You're talking about 15 bucks cheaper on gold, about a dollar cheaper per ounce on silver.
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  800-686-2337.
[58:31.000 --> 58:32.000]  Thanks, Ted.
[58:32.000 --> 58:37.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  Well, we're very honored to have him with us for a full hour today to talk about a host of issues.
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  His take on the president giving Israel the green light to go ahead and attack Iran.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  Almost all the analysts are now saying the attack is on in the next six months.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  The plunging dollar, what's happening with the economy.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  The Congress announcing there's no more fourth amendment, and that's how it reads.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:52.000]  He has been speaking out against this for many years, and he is quite a leader when it comes to the issues of freedom.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  He is former governor of Minnesota, of course Hollywood movie star, best-selling author, TV talk show host.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:01.000]  The list goes on and on.
[1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000]  Quite the Renaissance man.
[1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  Governor Jesse Ventura.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:06.000]  Governor, thanks for spending time with us today.
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:08.000]  Hi, Alex. How are you doing today?
[1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  I guess we'd say a sad day in America.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  Yeah, I always wonder what it was like for my grandparents to live through the depression, and it looks like we might be going into one.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  Yeah, there's no, you know, it was interesting the other day I was watching on television up here.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  And one of the local stations, they have a segment called where you can ask a question.
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  And the question was how do we make a strong dollar again?
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  How do we get the dollars strong?
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  Because obviously the dollars fell in through the floor.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  I mean, there's a half a dozen countries now that have a higher value or more than that than us.
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  And so they went to Hamlin University here in Minnesota, and they went to the head of economics and, well, I forget his other title, but it was appropriate.
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Please excuse me, I just got done working out, so if I'm breathing a little heavy, I just got off the elliptic machine.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  That's great.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  But anyway, he listed, in order to bring the dollar to be strong again, it's the exact two things that I've been harping on for the last month and a half.
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  Number one, to make the dollar strong, this professor said, is the debt.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  We must do something about the $9 trillion plus debt we owe throughout the world now.
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  And he said the number two thing that is driving the dollar to its weakness is the war in Iraq.
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  So the very two issues that are highest on my board are the very two issues that this expert said it would take to bring the dollar back.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  But apparently our country and most of the people in it aren't that worried about it.
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  You're right, Governor.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  The elite have made the decision to continue the devaluation of the dollar.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  Obviously, having the high debt means people don't buy our securities.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.000]  So the dollars devalued, that's 70 plus percent of it.
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  The other 25 percent is, of course, the speculation being driven by the war drums for Iran.
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  You're absolutely right.
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  The professor's right.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  The establishment knows that.
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:06.000]  Why do you think they're not going to reverse the destruction of our currency?
[1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  Because I don't think they really care.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  They're making their money and they're in their position.
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  To me, it's clear that there's a war on the middle class in America today being waged by our own government.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  And they're out to destroy what was the American dream and the American dream was really the middle class.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  We were the country where you could go get a job and you could support your family and you could live a life with a fair dream in it.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  That's being extinguished greatly today and it seems our elected illustrious officials don't have a problem with it.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:46.000]  Or they'll say they do, but what they do and what they say are generally two different things.
[1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  We're going to break in just a moment and come back within a long segment to go through a lot of important issues, Governor.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:56.000]  But first off, let's spend about a minute on your book.
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  It's doing quite well for those that don't know about your new book.
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  Tell us about it.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  Well, it's called Don't Start the Revolution.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  Without me, I wrote it while I was living in Mexico with Dick Russell, a friend of mine and a writer.
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  I just felt it was time for a bit of a wake-up call to the United States.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:12.000]  I felt that way.
[1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  I'm probably not too mainstream today, I guess.
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:24.000]  But I felt that we needed a wake-up call to get back to our roots and get back to paying attention to the Constitution and what formed our great country.
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  Because we've certainly seemed to have taken a path away from the Constitution, especially most recently in the last eight years.
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  And we don't seem to be heading back towards it.
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  So I thought there was a wake-up call for the Lammings here in the country that march off the cliff and don't look side to side.
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  They just do it.
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  Absolutely, Governor.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  That was the reason I wrote the book.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Fantastic.
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:46.000]  Stay there.
[1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  Back in three quick minutes with Governor Jesse Ventura.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:54.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  9-Eleven was an inside job.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:58.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage?
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF?
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:16.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:22.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  An inside job.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  How dare you?
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  I don't think that the Congress suggested that you're a 9-Eleven.
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  Well, Helen, it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  Truth rising.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  Download the film at PrisonPlanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:50.000]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  Are you fed up with all the side effects of chemicals in your shampoos and detergents?
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  Even fragrances can signal some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:01.000]  Hi, folks. Alex Jones here.
[1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  Why not go back to basics and be safe with Calvin Pure Soaps?

[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  Mainstream media. Government cover-ups.
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  You want answers?
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  Well, so does he.
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  Former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:20.000]  New book out on the New York Times bestseller list.
[1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  Don't start the revolution without me.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  He's with us for the rest of the hour.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:28.000]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, we're going to do something we haven't done on the other two interviews with him.
[1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:30.000]  We've been lucky enough to have.
[1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  And let's take some of your phone calls.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  Governor, I want to pick your brain about the war, the economy, the Fourth Amendment under attack, all these issues.
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:48.000]  But obviously, you know what I'm going to ask first here.
[1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  Now that we're into the interview.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  And I've learned to not trust the mainstream media.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  Last week, I called you at home and you said, no, I did not tell NPR that I was going, that I had committed to run.
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  I'll announce that next Monday or Tuesday.
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  Sure enough, the ABC headline said, Governor will run. I went and listened to the interview.
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  You said, if I decide to run here is while I will run, then ABC had to retract and Drudge had to retract what they had said.
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  So this time I don't want to go off with the news is saying other news is reporting that you're going to announce either way tonight on Larry King.
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  A, is that accurate? Or will it be tomorrow?
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  No, I guess it's accurate. Everybody tells me I will tonight.
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  So, you know, I guess it's kind of out of my hands. I don't want to be called a liar.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:50.000]  Amazing. Well, how could ABC run that headline that you announced last Thursday when NPR's headline said why government, why government, why Governor Ventura may run?
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:52.000]  I mean, how could ABC just make that up?
[1:09:52.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  Well, they make everything up. You know, it's they're in the business for money. They're in the business of ratings. And so if they can beat all the other networks to the punch, they're going to do it.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  Then accuracy is a secondary thing. Now, I mean, if they get it wrong, they just simply do a little blurb a day later.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:12.000]  If they have to, and most of the time they won't even bother with that.
[1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  Governor, you kind of came out for 9-11 Truth on this show unannounced. I had no idea you were going to do that four or five months ago and that caused a national firestorm.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  Why not go ahead and tell us if you're going to run for Senate right now on this show?
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:42.000]  Oh, because it's the middle of the afternoon and I don't want to be sieged with the media for the rest of the day. Is that a good answer?
[1:10:42.000 --> 1:10:44.000]  That is a good one. But let me make a guess.
[1:10:44.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  And then the point is, if I say it right now, that's what will happen. I think I'd rather say it this evening where I can, like a good Navy SEAL, run off in the shadows and disappear.
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  Well, here is my take on it. You wrote a book saying, don't start the revolution without me. I'm sure you've decided it's now the eve of or the day of you making the announcement, the eve of the deadline to be technical.
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  And I'm going to make the guess, and it's not a wild guess, but I'm going to predict you're going to announce you're running for Senate.
[1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  And this is why you're going to announce you're running for Senate tonight on Larry King, because you love this country.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:24.000]  You saw him shoot down the Fourth Amendment last week. You see us about to go to war with Iran that will further tank the economy.
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  You know we need your voice in the Senate and you love this republic. And so you're going to serve the republic one more time.
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  And you know you've already beaten the sorry excuse for a human being for governor that's running for Senate as well.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  And so you've been drafted by the American people and we're not going to start the revolution without you.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  And so you are drafted. You're running for the Senate, Jesse Ventura, and we all know it, aren't you?
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  Oh, Alex, Alex, you might be premature. Don't go that far. Wait till Larry King tonight.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  Well then, you better announce you're running for Senate.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:00.000]  What do you mean I better?
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  Well, you've got higher numbers in the polls this time.
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  I understand all that, but let me say this, Alex, it will be a total personal decision and my family will bear in it a great deal.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  Because you cannot do one of those jobs without the support of your family.
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  And if my family support is not there, I will not do it.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:26.000]  Because, well, I'll give you one example. I'm not going to subject my children to be attacked by the media again.
[1:12:26.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  That weighs heavily on me. So what my children say to me is going to have a great bearing on the decision that I make.
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  Have they said it? I mean, have you made your decision?
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:42.000]  Not quite yet. I have another child to speak with.
[1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  Well, I would like to speak to them and say, look, we need you to gut up for the country.
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  I mean, I understand they went through a lot. In fact, when we are changed, Minnesota was up there talking to you at a book signing.
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:58.000]  You would talk to them, but you wouldn't talk to the media. You don't talk to the Minnesota media. Why is that?
[1:12:58.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  I don't talk to them because they attacked my children when I was governor.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  The story and the way it went down was I had left to go on the largest trade mission in U.S. history to China.
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  I let a trade mission to China from Minnesota. And none of the media here bothered to send anyone on the trade mission.
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  It was the June before the following fall's reelection.
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  And so none of them chose to go on the trade mission.
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  And here I'm doing something that will directly benefit every person eventually in the state of Minnesota.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  Instead, they went out and trumped up a big story on my son.
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  There was a disgruntled employee that we fired who decided to get his 15 minutes of fame.
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  And he accused my son of underage drinking in the governor's residence.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  Well, first of all, my son was 22.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  So I find that a bit peculiar because nowhere in this country are you underage at 22.
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:14:04.000]  Second of all, the media didn't bother to question this employee and ask him the very simple question, Alex.
[1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  He went home every day at five o'clock. How would he know what went on at midnight?
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  They ran with the story. They trashed my son completely.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:22.000]  They put the CBS investigative eye team onto his friends to try to dig up anything they could on my son.
[1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  And then the day I got back from the trade mission from China, the headlines in the paper were nothing to do with the trade mission.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  It had everything to do with accusing my son.
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Well, I'll tell you why they did that, Governor, and you're not stupid. You know why.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:40.000]  You literally led the pack on third rail politics.
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  You scare the establishment. That's why you had 25 CIA agents there at the Capitol when you showed up on the first week.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  That's why ABC preemptively announced that you're going to run trying to steal your thunder.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  They're scared of you. They don't want you to run. You know that.
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  And I'm telling you, you can't give in to them.
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:06.000]  So I'm asking you as the American people, we need your anti-war pro-constitution voice in the Senate.
[1:15:06.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  And I think you're going to win if you run.
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  Yeah, but Alex, we're a great minority. We're a minority. We're not a majority.
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  Well, a minority of, you know, one who's in the right is a majority.
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  Yeah, you got a point there. But you know, and it's very difficult.
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  You know, running will put a great deal of stress on my marriage probably because, you know, my wife wants nothing to do with politics.
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  She never did and never will. And so it's really, I go out of it as a loner if I do.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  Plus living on the side of a jungle wall by the Pacific Ocean half the year.
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  I would imagine that is something that's hard to say no to, isn't it?
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:16:00.000]  Yeah, sure is. So anyway, we'll find out tonight at Larry King.
[1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:03.000]  So you will announce one way or the other tonight.
[1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:04.000]  Yeah.
[1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:07.000]  Talk about building suspense.
[1:16:07.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  Well, it all kind of started with Larry, so I figured that it should either explode with Larry or end with Larry, however it goes.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:18.000]  Yeah, let it end or let it grow from where it started.
[1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:26.000]  Yeah, exactly. Because it all started April 1st when I came back from Mexico and started my book tour and the first show I did was Larry King.
[1:16:26.000 --> 1:16:31.000]  You're trying to build suspense. I do believe you're going to call that final child. How many children do you have?
[1:16:31.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  Two.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:39.000]  Well, one of them is the one that woke you up to 9-11, you said. So, I mean, he's got to be on board with fighting the globalist.
[1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  Well, he's the one I got to talk to.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  Oh, he's going to say, Dad, get in there and fight the New World Order.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  Well, we'll see.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:55.000]  Well, he's got to make the sacrifice. I mean, I know that you're his dad, but we need you to, Governor.
[1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:56.000]  I know, I know.
[1:16:56.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  Well, let's say this, and this is the same question they twisted, but we'll be clear, if you do run, why are you going to run?
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:07.000]  If you do run for the U.S. Senate, why is Governor Jesse Ventura going to do that?
[1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  Well, if I did run, I would run because we have to get some type of hold and bring the attention to this deficit.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:23.000]  You notice in the presidential debates right now, they avoid the deficit like the plague because they're equally responsible for both Democrats and Republicans.
[1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:27.000]  They want to pretend it's not there. They don't want to talk about it.
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:33.000]  They don't want to tell the public that they've put our country so far in debt that if they were in the private sector,
[1:17:33.000 --> 1:17:37.000]  they'd be thrown in jail and run and world-com ring a bell.
[1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:43.000]  And that's the one reason, and then now the war, the pounding of the war drums.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:50.000]  I mean, we are now a first-strike nation. 9-11 changed our entire foreign policy.
[1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:58.000]  We will now attack another country before they attack us, which we proved in Iraq because Iraq never did a thing.
[1:17:58.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  If you believe the government's story on 9-11, there wasn't one Iraqi involved in it.
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  So why did we attack Iraq?
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  And so throughout the world today, many places view us as the people to fear.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:16.000]  You know, many countries feel that the United States is the one you've got to be afraid of
[1:18:16.000 --> 1:18:21.000]  because if you cross the United States, the United States is not above attacking you.
[1:18:21.000 --> 1:18:29.000]  And I think that's sad. And I think that as the leader of the free world, you should not lead with a big stick.
[1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  I think diplomacy is much better. You notice the Chinese, other than their internal strife,
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  they're not going out and getting involved in any of these wars throughout the world.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:42.000]  Why? Because they want to become the economic power of the world.
[1:18:42.000 --> 1:18:47.000]  That's their focus and their vast becoming it very quickly because we're so stupid
[1:18:47.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  and we're out getting involved in all these wars.
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:52.000]  You know, that's a great point, Governor.
[1:18:52.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  Studying history, every time, I mean, nine times out of ten, Napoleon Hitler, it didn't matter who,
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:08.000]  the aggressor, the Nazis, they always, no matter how big and bad, they always in the end tend to lose.
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  Well, I think it grew back even farther. I think our country right now is paralleling Rome.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  I think we're heading right down the same path Rome did.
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:23.000]  And that is entertainment and is the most important things in our lives.
[1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  Now, not our jobs. It's how do we entertain ourselves?
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  Clearly, that was shown when the media, rather than covering covering issues,
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  will cover the death of Anna Nicole Smith or Paris Hilton getting thrown in jail.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  These are their lead stories, which are nothing but entertainment stories.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  I'll tell you what, Governor, let's talk more about that.
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000]  In fact, I'm going to skip this break.
[1:19:44.000 --> 1:20:07.000]  We're going to skip this break here for the folks watching online. Here we go.
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:19.000]  Bad news for U.S. currency.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  Are you tired of hearing that a cure for cancer is coming,
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  but it will be available sometime in the future?
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:00.000]  At Lays Med Inc., the future is here.
[1:21:00.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  Now it's cancer's turn to die with our patented methodology.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation,
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  we can kill skin cancer and breast tumors of any size.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  And many other types of cancer without adverse side effects at our outpatient facility.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  We offer a real solution using real science.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:22.000]  Our unique approach to cancer treatment is what everyone has been waiting for.

[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:37.000]  and so much more.
[1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:40.000]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free.
[1:22:40.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  Join PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.000]  Burn the info bombs to disk.
[1:22:44.000 --> 1:22:46.000]  Put them on the file sharing networks.
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:48.000]  Bring down the New World Order.
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us,
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:59.000]  it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:22:59.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million,
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:05.000]  the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[1:23:05.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  Though the people of the U.S. where their numbers and influence are strongest
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:12.000]  have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice.
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:15.000]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[1:23:15.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  They are called Illuminati.
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:20.000]  Elite, opponents of the New World Order.
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:23.000]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:23:23.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  Everything they have built over the centuries,
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:30.000]  the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000]  the power they have established,
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:34.000]  the poisoning of the masses,
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:36.000]  the destruction of the earth and mankind,
[1:23:36.000 --> 1:23:39.000]  are undue through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  Visit our website at UnveilingThem.com.
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G, them.com.
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:49.000]  The message of His Kingdom.
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.000]  Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[1:23:59.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  He's got us all in suspense spellbound here.
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:06.000]  He'll be announcing tonight on Larry King Live,
[1:24:06.000 --> 1:24:08.000]  whether he's going to run for the U.S. Senate or not.
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  He's got almost a double-digit lead compared to what he even had
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:16.000]  when he first announced against the same individual that's running for Senate.
[1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:19.000]  He was behind the fellow in the past.
[1:24:19.000 --> 1:24:21.000]  He's now ahead of him.
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  And I think even with some of the chicanery with the voting machines,
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:26.000]  Governor Ventura would win by such a margin.
[1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:28.000]  And his views are so popular.
[1:24:28.000 --> 1:24:31.000]  You know, Governor Ventura, I actually disagree with some of what you said here today.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:33.000]  I keep saying that we're in the minority.
[1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:36.000]  We are in the majority with our views.
[1:24:36.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  Every poll shows that.
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  It's just that I guess you're right that we're in the minority
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  when it comes to people in the power structure,
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  because they are 180 degrees in the other direction of what the people want
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  or what the Constitution and Bill of Rights has to say.
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:51.000]  What do you say to that?
[1:24:51.000 --> 1:24:52.000]  Well, you may be right.
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  I don't know.
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  I don't claim to know everything.
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  And maybe we aren't the minority.
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:25:02.000]  But if we are the majority, we certainly seem to be silent.
[1:25:02.000 --> 1:25:05.000]  I mean, there's only a few people talking out.
[1:25:05.000 --> 1:25:06.000]  Well, I agree.
[1:25:06.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  Most people are afraid to say anything about 9-11.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:12.000]  You know, they think you're crazy if you do.
[1:25:12.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  Well, since you bring that up, you've been attacked by a lot of establishment people,
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  but you've also gotten a lot of support.
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:24.000]  And the polls show the majority of Americans believe they've been lied to about the story.
[1:25:24.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  I mean, obviously, you told the truth about 9-11.
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:31.000]  Why did you decide to take that plunge?
[1:25:31.000 --> 1:25:35.000]  Well, you know, when I started, and I really didn't take the plunge,
[1:25:35.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  I simply asked questions that to me have not been adequately answered.
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:45.000]  You know, and I consider myself a demolition expert,
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:49.000]  because I spent, you know, four years on active duty in the Navy
[1:25:49.000 --> 1:25:51.000]  as a member of the underwater demolition team.
[1:25:51.000 --> 1:25:55.000]  I was trained by the best demolition men the United States has.
[1:25:55.000 --> 1:26:00.000]  And every time I watch those buildings come down now over and over again,
[1:26:00.000 --> 1:26:04.000]  and I look at a building that's been demolitioned, they're identical.
[1:26:04.000 --> 1:26:09.000]  You know, when you watch them fall, but yet, if you bring that up or state that,
[1:26:09.000 --> 1:26:12.000]  right away, you're considered crazy.
[1:26:12.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  And how dare you make a statement like that?
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:18.000]  How dare you be so un-American? How dare you?
[1:26:18.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  And it goes on and on and on.
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  I'll tell you what, Alex, you take the line for a minute.
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:27.000]  I've got to run across to my desk because there's something I want to read on your show.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:30.000]  Absolutely. Take your time. Take your time, Governor.
[1:26:30.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  We've got him for the rest of the hour, folks.
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:34.000]  In the next segment, we're going to take a few of your calls,
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  but there need to be four of the Governor about the issues we're discussing.
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:40.000]  9-11, the war, the economy.
[1:26:40.000 --> 1:26:49.000]  But here comes Governor Ventura back from his desk as something he wants to read for us.
[1:26:49.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  We've got it.
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:53.000]  Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura, the former German defense minister,
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:57.000]  high-level members of the Japanese parliament, the former Italian president,
[1:26:57.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  coming out and questioning the official story or coming right out and saying it's an inside job.
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  I mean, you cannot downplay this, but the establishment frowns.
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:10.000]  Governor?
[1:27:10.000 --> 1:27:13.000]  Yep. Ah, here we go. I got it here. I finally found it.
[1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:15.000]  Got it on the wrong desk.
[1:27:15.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  I want to read this, Alex, and then I want to ask your general audience.
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:24.000]  It'll be a good segue to go maybe to callers.
[1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:30.000]  But this is a quote by a pretty famous person, and when you hear it,
[1:27:30.000 --> 1:27:36.000]  it really, to me, parallels the last eight years of the thought process here in the United States,
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:40.000]  where I've been saying that I'm kind of out of the loop now or it seems that I am.
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  I'll just read it. Okay, here it is.
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:48.000]  Quote, naturally, the common people don't want war,
[1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  but after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy.
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  And it is always a simple matter to drag the people along,
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:28:03.000]  whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship,
[1:28:03.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  voice or no voice, the people always can be brought to the bidding of the leaders.
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:15.000]  This is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked
[1:28:15.000 --> 1:28:22.000]  and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.
[1:28:22.000 --> 1:28:29.000]  Now, Alex, do you agree that that seems to be the mental philosophy we've had here since 9-11?
[1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:32.000]  Yes, and that's Herman Göring, head of the U.S.
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  You know your stuff well. That's Herman Göring, a quote from a Nazi.
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  Now, it troubles me greatly when I start looking at philosophy
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:45.000]  and how our government seems to be operating.
[1:28:45.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  And when it starts paralleling Nazis, isn't that about time a flag should fly up for us as citizens?
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:55.000]  You're right. And there's no doubt.
[1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  I mean, even the Hitler didn't just attack Poland.
[1:28:58.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  He staged an attack on their own military base and later admitted it or firebombed his own Reichstag
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:09.000]  to get his police state going. And we see last week the Democrats supposedly are so good.
[1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:13.000]  No, they said, yeah, we're against the Fourth Amendment.
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:18.000]  Repeat for all of us to know what's the Fourth Amendment again, Alex.
[1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:25.000]  That is the fact that they have to have a warrant and witnesses to search you or tap your phone.
[1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:29.000]  Yeah, and the Democrats voted last week to continue that policy,
[1:29:29.000 --> 1:29:35.000]  that they don't have to, that they can invade your privacy and literally disregard the Fourth Amendment.
[1:29:35.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  We'll be right back, Governor.
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:44.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:57.000]  Have you ever suffered from giardia, food poisoning, heavy metal poisoning, arthritis, fatigue, or high cholesterol?
[1:29:57.000 --> 1:30:03.000]  Maybe you're one of the 75 million Americans at the Center for Disease Control reports of suffering from internal parasites.

[1:30:55.000 --> 1:31:00.000]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:09.000]  This product is a one-of-a-kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:18.000]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:24.000]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[1:31:24.000 --> 1:31:30.000]  Alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content of your body.
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:35.000]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:57.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do.
[1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:59.000]  At least we thought we did.
[1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:06.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:32:06.000 --> 1:32:15.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:32:15.000 --> 1:32:22.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:25.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:32:25.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:38.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[1:32:38.000 --> 1:32:43.000]  and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:32:43.000 --> 1:33:01.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:08.000]  I already really liked Judge Jesse Ventura since I was a kid growing up watching Predator and the Running Man.
[1:33:08.000 --> 1:33:13.000]  He even watched him someone wrestling, rolling around laughing.
[1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:17.000]  I always liked the villains, but in reality he's the good guy.
[1:33:17.000 --> 1:33:29.000]  When he came on my show and talked about 9-11 being an inside job, I'd met him before that when he questioned the official story of 9-11.
[1:33:29.000 --> 1:33:39.000]  Really, his stock went up to 100% for me right up there, really, even past Ron Paul. Ron Paul said that he thinks they may stage attacks or may stage Gulf of Tonkens
[1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:45.000]  or that they may have let it happen, but he just won't come out and say that it looks like a controlled demolition for political reasons.
[1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:50.000]  I really respect Governor Jesse Ventura, and even if he doesn't announce he's running for Senate tonight on Larry King Live,
[1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:53.000]  you better believe I'll be watching. Hope you're watching.
[1:33:53.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  He's done his duty coming out on the show, Question 9-11, speaking out against the police state, and everything else he's done.
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  Before we go back to your calls, Governor Ventura, you were speaking about the parallels with Nazi Germany and with what we're seeing in this country today.
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:16.000]  Please finish your thoughts on that.
[1:34:16.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  Well, Alex, it troubles me when you, for the last eight years, you can take a quote like I read from Herman Goring and apply it to the United States of America,
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:35.000]  because that's exactly what we've been told. We've been told we were attacked, which all of us saw in the course of you.
[1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:40.000]  Maybe we were, maybe we weren't. Only they know for sure, I guess.
[1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:46.000]  And second of all, this nonsense about, you know, people need to remember what Thomas Jefferson said.
[1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  He said, dissension is the greatest form of patriotism, and in our republic that is true.
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:58.000]  But yet, in the last eight years, we've had it pounded into our heads that if you dissent your unpatriotic,
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:03.000]  that if you don't go along to get along, you're unpatriotic, and then they try to hit you with,
[1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:06.000]  if you don't support everything we're doing, you're against the troops.
[1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:13.000]  Well, that is not true. I'm a veteran. And to me, supporting the troops means not sending them in harm's way,
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  unless it's vital or absolutely necessary. And in my opinion, the Iraq war was certainly not vital, and it certainly wasn't necessary.
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:23.000]  Well, there's also...
[1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:34.000]  And I support our troops by bringing them home. Who, you know, to quote John Kerry after Vietnam, who will be the last man to die in Iraq?
[1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  Well, you're right. We also have this hiding behind the flag, which is particularly despicable.
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  They always say the flag is the last refuge of tyrants.
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  Patriotism is the last refuge of tyrants and thugs. And they're the ones that promised the troops they'd be home in six months,
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:55.000]  and knew they'd be there for a decade, and they're on Pentagon plans.
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:36:02.000]  They're the ones that want to just destabilize the region, not bring democracy, as they say publicly.
[1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  And it's just so despicable to see them continue over and over again to get away with this, and then have the nerve.
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  Bill O'Reilly goes on TV, it's a talking point on Fox and other places, and says,
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  Once the war starts, you're to shut your mouth, and you don't have any say when I thought the troops were fighting so that we'd have a say.
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:31.000]  And then you have 75% or more of all the donations from the troops to Republicans going to Ron Paul, the only anti-war candidate.
[1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  I mean, the majority of the troops in major polls are against the war.
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  So how dare these chicken hawks claim that we're not allowed to criticize this illegal war?
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:47.000]  And you know what gets me to, Alex, exactly what you said, these chicken hawks.
[1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:57.000]  Because the majority of the great war supporters of this country are the very people who they themselves would never put themselves in the line of danger,
[1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:04.000]  would never put a uniform on, and I'm talking about our current Commander-in-Chief, George W. Bush.
[1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:10.000]  He leads the way. Dick Cheney with what? Five deferments during Vietnam.
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:20.000]  Our own illustrious Norm Coleman, the senator from Minnesota, who was a huge war protestor at Hofstra University when he was back in college,
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  when his little hindler was on the line, and when he might have to go to war, he wanted no part of it.
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:33.000]  But today this guy's rubber-stamped everything with the war, and he's got a kid who's of age to go serve.
[1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:37.000]  Do you think his kids in the military hadn't do Iraq? Absolutely not.
[1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Well, Carl Rove's son lives right here in Austin, and he's of military age, and we don't see him going.
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:47.000]  Speaking of that, George Bush has a lower approval rating than Nixon.
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:53.000]  Congress has a 9% approval rating and a scientific poll, the lowest since polling began a century ago.
[1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:56.000]  This government is completely illegitimate.
[1:37:56.000 --> 1:38:04.000]  More the reason we need you there in the Senate as a speaker so the world knows that the people aren't for this war.
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:12.000]  If we don't punish the Democratic and Republican leaders that took us into this illegal war, then it really does hang around our neck.
[1:38:12.000 --> 1:38:19.000]  We really are guilty of these war crimes, but if we punish them, then we get some of our name and good faith back.
[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  What would you, I mean, are you for impeachment of Bush? Carl Rove, I don't know if you know this, fled the U.S. last week.
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:29.000]  There was a congressional subpoena. He's been indicted now. He's fled the U.S.
[1:38:29.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  I mean, your take on them being indicted or unimpeachment?
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  Well, I'll put it to you this way, Alex. I get very concerned and I get very confused in my country today.
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:52.000]  When cheating on your wife is an impeachable offense, but going to an illegal war and killing thousands of people isn't.
[1:38:52.000 --> 1:39:03.000]  I'm still trying to figure that one out. See, that's what I mean. I'm not mainstream because most people in this country had no problem when Bill Clinton got impeached for cheating on his wife,
[1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:16.000]  which to me, I don't condone it, but I don't care. Just like right now, the other reason that I probably won't fit in good is I'm not religious enough to hold office in this country anymore.
[1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  I don't have a minister. I don't go to church. So therefore, I probably don't have the type of values that they want to see in public office.
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  Well, at least you're not a fake and that's what matters. I mean, I'm sure you've read about the gay porn stars being shipped into the Bohemian Grove and into the White House mainstream news
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  and how the Republican senators are always caught in bathrooms and rothels with men. And of course, they're all big churchgoers.
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:51.000]  Now, I think people want a Jesse Ventura, even if you're not religious like they are, because they just want somebody who's a straight shooter. They're tired of the crap.
[1:39:51.000 --> 1:39:59.000]  Yeah, but I don't always agree with that either, Alex. You and I are going to differ on that. I don't believe that the people of this country truly want the truth.
[1:39:59.000 --> 1:40:01.000]  Do you want a good example?
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:02.000]  Tell me.
[1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:12.000]  People say they want the truth. They stand up and they say they do. But when push comes to shove, I think they more want to be told what they want to hear rather than the truth.
[1:40:12.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  Case in point, Jose Conceco. He was the only baseball player who was telling the truth about the rampant use of steroids.
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  And they got mad at him. They got mad at him and now he's been vindicated. Go ahead.
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  Right. But the point is the public, the media, and the whole country hated Jose Conceco, even after the truth came out, they still dog in him.
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:44.000]  They still won't give him his due. They still won't say, gee, Jose, we owe you an apology. You were telling the truth.
[1:40:44.000 --> 1:40:48.000]  I know you spoke out against steroids and how dangerous they are.
[1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  Well, to me, but it's irrelevant. You know, if baseball players want to use them, that's baseball's business. We don't need government hearings on it.
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:00.000]  The point is they went after him and persecuted him when he was telling the truth.
[1:41:00.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  Exactly.
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:11.000]  In the words of Jack Nicholson and a few good men, I don't believe you can't handle, not you, Alex, but the quote, you can't handle the truth.
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:13.000]  No, no, I agree. I was saying the quote.
[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:18.000]  I think that there's a great deal of honesty in that quote.
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:21.000]  In fact, I want that as a sound bite, Governor. We please say that again.
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:26.000]  You can't handle the truth, but I'm stealing that from Jack Nicholson.
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:30.000]  Absolutely, no, but that is it. But I think that's starting to change. You're right.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:36.000]  You know, we had milk and honey for so long. Our ancestors built, you know, this continent carved it out.
[1:41:36.000 --> 1:41:41.000]  They weren't perfect, but they were sure, you know, daring and hardworking and piratical.
[1:41:41.000 --> 1:41:47.000]  And then now we got fat and decadent and thought that evil and corruption was cute.
[1:41:47.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  And I think the people are going to find out now with the economy that it's not cute.
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:56.000]  Well, you know what I'm, you know what I'm, you know, and I hate to say this, Alex, but you know what I'm happy about today?
[1:41:56.000 --> 1:41:59.000]  And it's a sad thing to be happy about.
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:00.000]  What's that, Governor?
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:06.000]  I'm happy that the people of America in their economy now are feeling some pain because of this war.
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:12.000]  The problem with this war from day one was that it took five years for the pain to get here.
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:20.000]  But now the pain has arrived because this war plays a big part in the horrible shape that our economy is in today.
[1:42:20.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  And it's taken this long and places a four to five dollars a gallon for gas to finally reach home with the American people
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  that may be able to wake them up and tell them that war is not a good thing, that war is not a profit maker,
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:37.000]  that it doesn't help your economy.
[1:42:37.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  In fact, it does the opposite. It destroys the economy.
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  Well, I agree with you.
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:47.000]  And as you said, the top economist, it's very simple.
[1:42:47.000 --> 1:42:55.000]  Dollar devaluation because of excess government spending and the banks creating too much liquidity,
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:43:03.000]  as well as the war driving speculation, is what is bringing us down into what mainstream media is now saying could be a depression.
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:08.000]  But still, you hear the neocons on radio saying, let's blow the hell out of Iran.
[1:43:08.000 --> 1:43:12.000]  And I've talked to liquor store owners and pizza place owners, I know.
[1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:19.000]  They say that whenever there's a war, a bombardment, that they sell out a liquor and pizza and these men go home
[1:43:19.000 --> 1:43:25.000]  and feel some manly extension off of seeing cluster bombs being dropped on children.
[1:43:25.000 --> 1:43:33.000]  And actually, I was thinking that this morning, in a sick way, all these decadent people that love the lies, love being bullies,
[1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:38.000]  love being part of this evil, do they think the way the universe works, that they can be supporting all this evil
[1:43:38.000 --> 1:43:41.000]  and that it isn't going to blow back on them?
[1:43:41.000 --> 1:43:47.000]  I don't know, but I've always believed what goes around comes around, Alex.
[1:43:47.000 --> 1:43:52.000]  And we're going to get our comeuppance, I think, pretty quick here.
[1:43:52.000 --> 1:43:56.000]  If we don't change the path we're going on instead of leading with diplomacy.
[1:43:56.000 --> 1:44:03.000]  That's the one thing I did like about Barack Obama, where he said that he would talk to our enemies and yet he took all the heat for that.
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:08.000]  I don't understand why you get heat for talking with your enemy.
[1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:15.000]  You can always fight him. Fighting him is always the last option and it always remains out there.
[1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:18.000]  But as I said, it should be the last option.
[1:44:18.000 --> 1:44:23.000]  A war is the result of failed political leadership. It's that simple.
[1:44:23.000 --> 1:44:32.000]  So all you people out there that are listening, George Bush is failed political leadership. That's why we're at war.
[1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:37.000]  It's amazing. I want to take a few calls here with you, Governor Ventura, but in the 15 minutes we've got left,
[1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:43.000]  any other key points or things you want to impart to this audience?
[1:44:43.000 --> 1:44:46.000]  No, not really. Just hopefully the wake-up call.
[1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:54.000]  The people better start standing up and better start speaking out because I'm getting tired of doing it and standing alone.
[1:44:54.000 --> 1:44:58.000]  Remember my second book, Alex, was Do I Stand Alone?
[1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:04.000]  Well, Governor, listen, now hold on. I know how it is to be frustrated.
[1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:10.000]  And I'm excusing you. You're the one voice out there. You take a tremendous amount of heat yourself.
[1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:14.000]  And I commend you for having the courage to continue what you do.
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.000]  Oh, no, sir. I commend you. We appreciate you.
[1:45:16.000 --> 1:45:17.000]  But let me just...
[1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:22.000]  No, Alex, you're doing just as much as me because you're on the air every day. I'm not on the air every day.
[1:45:22.000 --> 1:45:31.000]  Well, I just want to say this. There is a tide in the fortunes of men when, you know, taking it to the flood or I'm getting that backwards.
[1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:35.000]  There is a tide in the affairs of men when taking it to the flood leads on to fortune.
[1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:40.000]  That's a Julius Caesar quote. There is a tide in the affairs of men when taking it to the flood leads on to fortune.
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  And, you know, the fortune you and I are after is liberty and freedom for our children and grandchildren, our prodigy, our progeny to come.
[1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:54.000]  And so I'm saying to you, you came early. You came before this thing really came to a head.
[1:45:54.000 --> 1:46:14.000]  Now you are right at that flashpoint, Governor Ventura, and we need somebody, you know, who's intelligent, who is, you know, manly, who is strong, who is the archetypal leader type, you know, up there with the chiseled, you know, jaw and the intellect and the gruff voice to be a leader during these times of crises.
[1:46:14.000 --> 1:46:20.000]  And, you know, we got Ron Paul and a few others. And so that's why I believe you're going to announce for the Senate.
[1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:33.000]  I hope your son says, Dad, do it. I know it means six years in that nightmare pit of DC, but you'll still be able to take some time off for fishing and, you know, going out and surfing and seeing your wife.
[1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:41.000]  I mean, I understand you've already given a lot. I understand it was hellish being governor and being lied about and having your children being hunted by the, you know, media.
[1:46:41.000 --> 1:46:52.000]  But, but all I'm trying to say is this is history. This is history. You can't turn history down or your whole life up to this point, being in this position. I think you're going to make the right decision tonight.
[1:46:52.000 --> 1:46:55.000]  Well, there is no right or wrong decision.
[1:46:55.000 --> 1:47:03.000]  Well, you've certainly already come out and talked about 9-11 and spoken out. I mean, you've already done your duty. I'm saying we need you to go above and beyond that.
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:06.000]  Okay. Well, anyway, Alex, can we go to some cars?
[1:47:06.000 --> 1:47:10.000]  Yes, yes, I'm just, I'm just lobbying you here, sir.
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:13.000]  I know you are. You're doing a good job.
[1:47:13.000 --> 1:47:18.000]  We need you. Hey, I'm telling you, man, they're building. I mean, you know about the concentration camps they've built, right?
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:19.000]  Yeah, I've heard about them.
[1:47:19.000 --> 1:47:26.000]  No, I mean, it's in the Houston Chronicle. I've been to them. Bush admits that the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, he's going to pass that on to Barack Obama.
[1:47:26.000 --> 1:47:33.000]  You watch Barack Obama or McCain or end up being sleepers. Let's go ahead and take calls for Governor Jesse Ventura. We're going to skip this break.
[1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:36.000]  Let's talk to Eric in Wisconsin. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:47:36.000 --> 1:47:38.000]  How are you doing, Mr. Ventura?
[1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:41.000]  How are you today? I'm breathing. I'm breathing.
[1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  Say, listen, I wanted to first off start by thanking you for what you've done so far for this country.
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  And I want to say that you're a true American. I myself was in the military and my M.O.S. was 12 Bravo, so I also was sort of an explosives expert.
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  And I agree fully with your views on 9-11.
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:09.000]  And having worked with demolition, when you watch those buildings, you see them like me, that they look like they're brought down with demo?
[1:48:09.000 --> 1:48:13.000]  You know, honestly, I could not see anything besides that.
[1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  Really?
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  It's interesting because it took me a while to get to that point, I think, because I was in denial. I didn't want to believe it.
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:32.000]  Well, I don't think anybody did. I don't think anybody did. And I just want to say that whatever your decision is tonight, we respect you and we honor that decision,
[1:48:32.000 --> 1:48:42.000]  because I know family is a huge commitment. I do also want to say that we are in a monumental period in history where we can either look back on this and say,
[1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:46.000]  you know, man, I wish I would have done it, or we can look back and say, I wish I had.
[1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  Yeah, he's going to run. This is greatness right here.
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:54.000]  This is the make of the blanket moment.
[1:48:54.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  Mr. Ventura, you've got many, many people backing you.
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  Well, thank you. I appreciate that.
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:07.000]  You know what? He had the courage to come on this show and talk about 9-11. I know what's in you, Governor Ventura. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  There's no coward in Mr. Ventura whatsoever. And we need more people like that in office.
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:18.000]  And I know it's a huge sacrifice to be making for your family, but imagine what would happen if you didn't.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:29.000]  Well, what would happen if I don't? You know, I'm not so fully in tune like everyone else that thinks one person can make the total difference.
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:37.000]  I think that I would be like a redheaded stepchild out there. They would do everything to bury me that they could.
[1:49:37.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  Look how much support Ron Paul got over $27 million. I think you're going to get that same type of support. I think most of that movement would get behind you.
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  And again, the media doesn't have the power it had six, seven years ago. Remember how they censored you when you tried to do your TV show?
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  You're not going to be censored now because there's this huge alternative media now.
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  Wait a minute. Now, that's not true because if you look at what's happening right now in St. Paul, where they're going to have the Republican convention,
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:19.000]  the police and the courts are already ruling that the protesters will not be allowed on any of the main streets, that they're going to be only to side streets.
[1:50:19.000 --> 1:50:21.000]  So that way they'll get them off the road.
[1:50:21.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  And you should march out there.
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000]  You don't have to cover any of the protesting.
[1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  Yeah, I think you should march out there and protest that yourself. That's the type of aggressive stuff.
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  Governor, let me advise you covertly.
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:39.000]  I mean, we need you as a cub general at the front of the army out there.
[1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000]  I'm an enlisted man. I'm not a general.
[1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:46.000]  Well, you're a general now, whether you like it or not. You're like Chuck Yeager who ended up being a general.
[1:50:46.000 --> 1:50:50.000]  Don't be calling me a general officer. I knew who my parents were.
[1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:56.000]  Do you ever have one of those days where everything goes right? First, I get the best parking space at work.
[1:50:56.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney,
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:08.000]  finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston online from my desk with WebEx.
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:12.000]  WebEx lets me take meetings and give presentations from my desk.
[1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:18.000]  I just talked to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop so I can travel the world
[1:51:18.000 --> 1:51:21.000]  and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.
[1:51:50.000 --> 1:51:57.000]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us. I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[1:51:57.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  How so, Clyde?
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet just by waving it near you.
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:07.000]  I can skim your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse. Just watch.
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:11.000]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen. You gotta be kidding me.
[1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:17.000]  Nope, with 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune as long as people don't hear about identity stronghold.
[1:52:17.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  Why? What's identity stronghold?
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:25.000]  They make the secure sleeve. When people keep their credit cards in the shield and secure sleeve, I can't read them.
[1:52:25.000 --> 1:52:28.000]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[1:52:28.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  No way. Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:35.000]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  I already got some. I also got some to fit our passports.
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at idstronghold.com.
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:45.000]  idstronghold.com?
[1:52:45.000 --> 1:52:50.000]  Right. Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[1:52:50.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful new government.
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird. Put their objective being world domination.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:11.000]  For thousands of years, their Dark Order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order,
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[1:53:19.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:31.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[1:53:31.000 --> 1:53:34.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money. They have all the money they need.
[1:53:34.000 --> 1:53:36.000]  They're after power. That's their affidavit.
[1:53:36.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  Order in-game on DVD at prisonplanet.com or infowars.com
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:45.000]  or watch it online right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[1:53:45.000 --> 1:53:49.000]  In-game blueprint for global enslaved. You have been warned.
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:54:00.000]  States now have passed the use of medicinal marijuana where doctors should be able to prescribe it.
[1:54:00.000 --> 1:54:04.000]  And yet Bush and the federal government says, oh no, we won't allow that.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:10.000]  Oregon two times has passed the dignity and death bill where the people have voted on it.
[1:54:10.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  And yet Bush says, we don't care if you voted on it, we're not going to allow it happen.
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  And so George Bush is totally for federal power.
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:23.000]  So it doesn't surprise me in the least that he would be federalizing most of our law enforcement
[1:54:23.000 --> 1:54:27.000]  because that's what our government has been heading that direction.
[1:54:27.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  It continues to head that direction and nobody seems to want to stop it.
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  Governor Ventura, getting back briefly to 9-11 to take a few final calls.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  I mean, everybody who's in control demolition, and I've talked to countless people on air,
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:45.000]  guessed about it, say that's a classical control demolition.
[1:54:45.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  We have firemen and police saying, we've been told to get back.
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  They're going to bring the buildings down.
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:54.000]  We have all of this going on.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:55:01.000]  I mean, how dumb does the government think we are to sit there and tell us that we're crazy
[1:55:01.000 --> 1:55:03.000]  and question the falling of those towers?
[1:55:03.000 --> 1:55:05.000]  Because they will win.
[1:55:05.000 --> 1:55:08.000]  You notice there's no other investigations happening.
[1:55:08.000 --> 1:55:11.000]  There aren't going to be any investigations happening.
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:17.000]  You notice on the Democratic side, if it's brought up to people like Bill Clinton and even Bill Maher,
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  they yell and scream at the people and tell them they're crazy.
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:24.000]  There will be nothing that will happen on 9-11, in my opinion.
[1:55:24.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  9-11 is a buried, done deal.
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:32.000]  The history books is recorded as such, and it will take a monumental thing.
[1:55:32.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  Because look at John F. Kennedy.
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:38.000]  They still hope that the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald was a lone assassin,
[1:55:38.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  and anybody that can believe that hogwash, but yet the history books are stated that way, aren't they?
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:50.000]  But, Governor, we now have the Internet and other things, and the history books have finally been discredited,
[1:55:50.000 --> 1:55:57.000]  and it didn't take us 40 years to get 80-something percent of people thinking that 9-11 was an inside job,
[1:55:57.000 --> 1:56:00.000]  as 80-plus percent now know that Kennedy was an inside job.
[1:56:00.000 --> 1:56:06.000]  But even with all those figures, Alex, it still doesn't matter, does it?
[1:56:06.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  No, you're right. We're fighting an uphill battle, but we're in a better position than we were in the past, Governor.
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  That's all I'm saying.
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  You're the eternal optimist.
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:22.000]  Well, I try to be, but my point is, is that by exposing false flag terrorism, it makes it harder for them to stage it again.
[1:56:22.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  Yeah, that's true, but they will. Trust me.
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  It's just like what was the old saying from Adolf Hitler, the bigger the lie, the easier the sell.
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  Governor, in closing on Iran, they're talking about hitting them in the next six months.
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:42.000]  Bush came out and said, go ahead and hit them to Israel.
[1:56:42.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  They're massing Israeli aircraft in Iraq.
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:49.000]  Do you see any way of averting this, and if it does happen, what do you see developing?
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:54.000]  Well, I don't see any way of averting it, because I think it's going to be Bush's last hurrah.
[1:56:54.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  You know, he's going to get us then entrenched probably in a three-war front.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  Well, you notice Afghanistan, I just read today, eight of our soldiers were just killed the other day in Afghanistan.
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  So Afghanistan is rising up. George Bush never finished the job there, because he misdirected all our troops before getting the job done into Iraq.
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  And that's the classic example of someone who doesn't know jack about military, which is our president.
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  Or perhaps they want to get us tied up in a war, so we'll rally around the flag while they suck the Treasury drive.
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  Well, that too, and it also will make the Republicans for some reason even stronger, because another additional war everybody's saying is going to help John McCain.
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:52.000]  So don't think it's beyond the Republicans to get going against him, divert everybody to Iran, and then they're going to sell us on the fact that even though the largest attack in U.S. history happened on a Republican watch,
[1:57:52.000 --> 1:57:55.000]  you notice they're already blaming Bill Clinton for 9-11.
[1:57:55.000 --> 1:58:04.000]  Well, let me ask you this. Do you think we're in danger of them staging some type of Gulf of Tonkin or other terror event to get us into a war with Iran?
[1:58:04.000 --> 1:58:10.000]  Absolutely. Read the last step along in my book. I wrote that a year ago.
[1:58:10.000 --> 1:58:19.000]  All right, Governor Ventura, this hour is over. It's a one-minute break. Is it possible, unless you've got another interview, to do five more to take two final calls?
[1:58:19.000 --> 1:58:22.000]  I'll take two calls, but that's got to be with Alex.
[1:58:22.000 --> 1:58:30.000]  Yes, sir. Yeah, it's only a five-minute segment, and then we've got Bob Chapman coming on. Stay with us back in 70 seconds, sir.
[1:58:30.000 --> 1:58:40.000]  Thank you for listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:58:40.000 --> 1:58:48.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[1:58:48.000 --> 1:58:52.000]  You like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[1:58:52.000 --> 1:58:59.000]  I'll do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage. It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF.
[1:58:59.000 --> 1:59:07.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:59:07.000 --> 1:59:13.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:59:13.000 --> 1:59:19.000]  Inside job? How dare you?
[1:59:19.000 --> 1:59:23.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:59:23.000 --> 1:59:26.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:59:26.000 --> 1:59:44.000]  The government has not told the truth. In five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:22.000]  Mohamed Thomas and Scott, only time we had to take your calls, moving quickly, last five minutes with Governor Ventura.
[2:00:22.000 --> 2:00:28.000]  Just finishing up with that statement. You are worried about some type of stage terror attack as a pretext to go into Iran, sir?
[2:00:28.000 --> 2:00:36.000]  Oh, yeah, absolutely. I don't think anything, you know. Remember, these two political parties and the Republicans are in bad shape right now.
[2:00:36.000 --> 2:00:46.000]  McCain's trailing. Republicans look like they'll get slaughtered in the congressional races and they're going to lose all their power.
[2:00:46.000 --> 2:00:54.000]  So rest assured that some type of decision they will have to come up with in an attempt to continue to keep themselves in power,
[2:00:54.000 --> 2:00:58.000]  because that's what the two parties do and that's their main objective.
[2:00:58.000 --> 2:01:03.000]  Well, we also have all these memos confirmed where the Republicans are saying we need terror attacks.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:06.000]  I mean, how much more obvious does it have to get?
[2:01:06.000 --> 2:01:07.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:10.000]  My God, these people ought to be all put in chains right now.
[2:01:10.000 --> 2:01:13.000]  And how much more stupid can we be if we buy into this?
[2:01:13.000 --> 2:01:16.000]  All right, let's go to JJ in Florida, then Muhammad in Chicago.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:19.000]  JJ in Florida. Make it quick. We've got about two and a half minutes left.
[2:01:19.000 --> 2:01:21.000]  Hey, how are you doing today?
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:22.000]  Good.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:27.000]  Hey, pretty good. I was a CH-46 crew chief. I bet you remember those. Hi, Jesse.
[2:01:27.000 --> 2:01:29.000]  Oh, I've jumped out of a few of them.
[2:01:29.000 --> 2:01:33.000]  Yeah. Hey, did you do any covert stuff? I was in the 80s.
[2:01:33.000 --> 2:01:38.000]  And I remember dropping you guys off in the jungles of the Philippines and all kinds of stuff.
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:43.000]  Well, I was in from 69 to 73 on active duty.
[2:01:43.000 --> 2:01:47.000]  Right. Well, anyway, I'm way back. I'm one of them guys.
[2:01:47.000 --> 2:01:51.000]  I was in the Navy when the ships were made of wood and the men were made of steel.
[2:01:51.000 --> 2:01:58.000]  Hey, I was just in Jacksonville for a while and you had to see our Navy now to make you want to throw up.
[2:01:58.000 --> 2:02:04.000]  It's feminized. It's not a smart ship and took a tour. I couldn't believe it.
[2:02:04.000 --> 2:02:08.000]  Well, you know, I don't know. I don't find that so bad.
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:10.000]  It'd be better looking at some girls than maybe you.
[2:02:10.000 --> 2:02:12.000]  Well, I picked up.
[2:02:12.000 --> 2:02:14.000]  I see that only in fun.
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:17.000]  But anyway, I said, well, girls wouldn't be so bad.
[2:02:17.000 --> 2:02:20.000]  Yeah, I got to bring some women in for, you know, have some fun.
[2:02:20.000 --> 2:02:23.000]  I was driving a camper while I picked up this one sailor.
[2:02:23.000 --> 2:02:28.000]  You wouldn't believe this girl that jumped in and he goes, hey, buddy, how would you like to have her?
[2:02:28.000 --> 2:02:30.000]  You never had her on a ship, did you?
[2:02:30.000 --> 2:02:34.000]  Have some camp women. I got to jump here. Let's go to another call.
[2:02:34.000 --> 2:02:37.000]  Mohamed in Chicago, you're on the air with Governor Ventura. Go ahead.
[2:02:37.000 --> 2:02:39.000]  All right. Thanks for taking my call.
[2:02:39.000 --> 2:02:41.000]  Hey, what's up?
[2:02:41.000 --> 2:02:48.000]  Okay, so I didn't really expect that Ventura was going to be on, but I can just pose this question to both of you all.
[2:02:48.000 --> 2:02:57.000]  Now, it's no denying that we're headed like very rapidly into an economic depression as well as a police state here in America.
[2:02:57.000 --> 2:03:02.000]  And me, I'm kind of young. I've got the opportunity to travel.
[2:03:02.000 --> 2:03:07.000]  I am scared. I don't want to be here when everything collapses as far as the economy.
[2:03:07.000 --> 2:03:12.000]  It's going to collapse worldwide. You've got to blame the politicians now, so they'll strengthen the dollar.
[2:03:12.000 --> 2:03:16.000]  What Governor Ventura said earlier, you know, he's gone out and checked with the experts like we all have.
[2:03:16.000 --> 2:03:22.000]  We have got to stop spending as much and stop the wars that will buoy the dollar.
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.000]  Governor Ventura?
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:28.000]  Yeah, I agree. You know, those are the two main things. Stop the spending.
[2:03:28.000 --> 2:03:35.000]  Stop putting ourselves in debt. The main thing is this nine-plus trillion-dollar debt.
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:39.000]  Look at it like you'd look at your own home, economics.
[2:03:39.000 --> 2:03:46.000]  If you've got a mortgage or a debt hanging over your head that's more than you make, that's more than what all the worth you have,
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:49.000]  well, your economy is in big trouble.
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:55.000]  Well, that's the same way because of the debt that our economy is in trouble today and the devaluing of the dollar
[2:03:55.000 --> 2:03:58.000]  goes hand-in-hand with the high oil price.
[2:03:58.000 --> 2:04:00.000]  Mohamed, does that answer your question?
[2:04:00.000 --> 2:04:05.000]  Well, I just want to say because I don't want to be here when the dollar is worthless.
[2:04:05.000 --> 2:04:07.000]  Yeah, there's nowhere for you to run. You want to ask where to go?
[2:04:07.000 --> 2:04:09.000]  That's right. There ain't no way to run.
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:11.000]  No way to run, buddy. Appreciate the call.
[2:04:11.000 --> 2:04:16.000]  The meltdown of our economy is going to cause a world hyperinflationary depression.
[2:04:16.000 --> 2:04:21.000]  That's Nobel Prize winner Joseph Sticklets. That's the head of Reaganomics.
[2:04:21.000 --> 2:04:24.000]  Dr. Roberts, we've had them all on. Got a big expert coming up next segment.
[2:04:24.000 --> 2:04:29.000]  Bob Chapman, formerly the biggest gold and silver broker in the world. He's now retired.
[2:04:29.000 --> 2:04:34.000]  Jesse Ventura, Governor Ventura, we pray that you will, we hope that you're going to be running for Senate,
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:37.000]  but if not, you've done your duty. Thank you for spending time with us.
[2:04:37.000 --> 2:04:42.000]  Thank you, Alex. It's always my pleasure and I look forward to doing it again before I head to Mexico.
[2:04:42.000 --> 2:04:44.000]  Thank you. We'll talk to you soon, sir.
[2:04:44.000 --> 2:04:45.000]  Very good. Bye-bye.
[2:04:45.000 --> 2:04:48.000]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen. Was that a hint?
[2:05:20.000 --> 2:05:25.000]  From history, we saw that when church and state united, known as Papal Rome, religious intolerance resulted.
[2:05:25.000 --> 2:05:28.000]  This union would go directly contrary to the great principles of our nation.
[2:05:28.000 --> 2:05:31.000]  America and Papal Rome are uniting in this agenda.
[2:05:31.000 --> 2:05:36.000]  Protestant America, awake before it is too late. The prophecies are fast fulfilling.

[2:08:13.000 --> 2:08:22.000]  Well, we just gave you Governor Ventura from his home in Minnesota for an hour and five minutes exclusive
[2:08:22.000 --> 2:08:25.000]  right before he makes the announcement on Larry King.
[2:08:25.000 --> 2:08:28.000]  That was kind of ominous at the end when he said,
[2:08:28.000 --> 2:08:34.000]  Well, I'll talk to you again before I go back to Mexico.
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:38.000]  And ladies and gentlemen, that may have been a Freudian slip.
[2:08:38.000 --> 2:08:46.000]  But that sounded to me like he was intending on evacuating the United States down to fun and surf.
[2:08:46.000 --> 2:08:48.000]  You know, he lives, I know where he lives.
[2:08:48.000 --> 2:08:56.000]  He lives, you know, nobody to say, but let's just say an hour away from power
[2:08:56.000 --> 2:09:04.000]  in a two little bedroom bungalow on the Pacific Ocean and the hills right over the coast in the jungle.
[2:09:04.000 --> 2:09:08.000]  And he's got solar power and everything and he says it is heaven on earth.
[2:09:08.000 --> 2:09:13.000]  God Almighty, I'm tempted to do the same thing to say, you know what?
[2:09:13.000 --> 2:09:18.000]  The country, the scumbag new world order are screwed up patriot movement.
[2:09:18.000 --> 2:09:20.000]  You can all just beat the hell out of each other.
[2:09:20.000 --> 2:09:27.000]  I am escaping to the jungle, but I have a sneaking suspicion that the new order would find me there.
[2:09:27.000 --> 2:09:30.000]  Yeah, I mean, Mexico is falling apart going into revolution.
[2:09:30.000 --> 2:09:32.000]  You can't own a gun down there.
[2:09:32.000 --> 2:09:34.000]  There is nowhere to go, folks.
[2:09:34.000 --> 2:09:36.000]  New Zealand's turning into a police state.
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:40.000]  Costa Rica, Argentina was the place to run until 2000.
[2:09:40.000 --> 2:09:42.000]  Their dollar was as strong as the US dollar.
[2:09:42.000 --> 2:09:44.000]  They had his highest standard of living.
[2:09:44.000 --> 2:09:48.000]  Average income was like $30,000 there.
[2:09:48.000 --> 2:09:53.000]  Not anymore, ladies and gentlemen, their average income is a few thousand.
[2:09:53.000 --> 2:09:58.000]  So there's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, and he would not tell me off air.
[2:09:58.000 --> 2:10:00.000]  I talked to him some off air.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:07.000]  I talked to him at home last week, and Governor Ventura is warming quite a bit to me.
[2:10:07.000 --> 2:10:09.000]  I'm sure you can all tell.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:13.000]  You can only hear some of the off air discussions.
[2:10:13.000 --> 2:10:16.000]  Oh, God help us, man.
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:19.000]  God help us.
[2:10:19.000 --> 2:10:22.000]  Forget moving down to the Pacific coast of Mexico.
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:29.000]  I would just like to go stay in a tiny motel on the beach somewhere like that for a month with my children.
[2:10:29.000 --> 2:10:31.000]  God, just heaven.
[2:10:31.000 --> 2:10:37.000]  Eating blackened fish or fried fish right out of the ocean you catch.
[2:10:37.000 --> 2:10:43.000]  Snorkeling around, watching the storm clouds roll in in the evening.
[2:10:43.000 --> 2:10:46.000]  I love the tropics, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:10:46.000 --> 2:10:47.000]  I love palm trees.
[2:10:47.000 --> 2:10:52.000]  I love blue sky and blue water.
[2:10:52.000 --> 2:10:53.000]  I just love it.
[2:10:53.000 --> 2:10:57.000]  It's torture to see yuppies in Lexuses, and I'm not knocking having a Lexus.
[2:10:57.000 --> 2:11:04.000]  The people getting off on having it, and the neighbors looking at you weird, and people prancing around,
[2:11:04.000 --> 2:11:08.000]  and just the ignorance, and more on yuppies laughing at me.
[2:11:08.000 --> 2:11:11.000]  One came in the radio studio yesterday and was laughing at me.
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:15.000]  I know he means a call screener that's always messing with me over the years.
[2:11:15.000 --> 2:11:19.000]  I tried to call into local shows on the station, and I just feel sorry for him.
[2:11:19.000 --> 2:11:21.000]  I don't even want to be around him.
[2:11:21.000 --> 2:11:25.000]  See, I'd rather be around a bunch of poor natives.
[2:11:25.000 --> 2:11:30.000]  I'd rather be around all poor, you know, Mayan Mexicans,
[2:11:30.000 --> 2:11:34.000]  than I'd rather be around all the arrogant know-it-all gringos,
[2:11:34.000 --> 2:11:39.000]  and all of the, you know, ignorant scum other groups.
[2:11:39.000 --> 2:11:41.000]  It's just really, we've degenerated.
[2:11:41.000 --> 2:11:43.000]  You heard Ventura talking about that.
[2:11:43.000 --> 2:11:44.000]  There's still a lot of good people here.
[2:11:44.000 --> 2:11:50.000]  Don't get me wrong, but when you've got a barrel that's half rotten apples with worms coming out of them,
[2:11:50.000 --> 2:11:56.000]  there's some clean apples in there that I've even seen a rotten barrel of apples out of an orchard
[2:11:56.000 --> 2:12:00.000]  when I was a kid that had been sitting in a shed for a couple weeks,
[2:12:00.000 --> 2:12:02.000]  and worms had gotten into it.
[2:12:02.000 --> 2:12:07.000]  And I remember having to, I was told my job was to pick through some of them by my grandma
[2:12:07.000 --> 2:12:10.000]  when I was down there during the summer.
[2:12:10.000 --> 2:12:12.000]  And she said, oh yeah, these got left in there.
[2:12:12.000 --> 2:12:13.000]  We didn't know they were in there.
[2:12:13.000 --> 2:12:14.000]  I want you to pick through them.
[2:12:14.000 --> 2:12:17.000]  So I've literally picked through a, it wasn't a barrel,
[2:12:17.000 --> 2:12:21.000]  it was a big box of rotten apples, and probably a third of them were still good.
[2:12:21.000 --> 2:12:23.000]  But you know, you've got worms coming out of them.
[2:12:23.000 --> 2:12:24.000]  Some are rotten.
[2:12:24.000 --> 2:12:27.000]  You've got to wash the ones that don't have worms off.
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:28.000]  And that's really who we are.
[2:12:28.000 --> 2:12:31.000]  I mean, when I look at the barrel and say, look at this rotten country.
[2:12:31.000 --> 2:12:34.000]  I'm not saying you're rotten or I'm rotten.
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:43.000]  But actually, I read about pioneers and forebears and how hard they worked and how strong they were.
[2:12:43.000 --> 2:12:45.000]  And it just isn't some image of the past.
[2:12:45.000 --> 2:12:46.000]  I mean, it was true.
[2:12:46.000 --> 2:12:51.000]  I'm reading Men Against the Sea, which is based on the true letters and documents
[2:12:51.000 --> 2:12:54.000]  and the court marshals of the Mutiny on the Bounty.
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:13:00.000]  True story, but I'm going to read Pitcairn's Island, the last one after that.
[2:13:00.000 --> 2:13:11.000]  And it describes in there a 4,000 plus mile journey in a 21 foot long boat with a tiny sail
[2:13:11.000 --> 2:13:17.000]  with enough food for 18 men for one meal.
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:26.000]  And they went, well, was it close to two months on that?
[2:13:26.000 --> 2:13:34.000]  I mean, folks, I mean, I can't imagine toughening it out for five hours out deep sea fishing,
[2:13:34.000 --> 2:13:38.000]  which I've done, you know, through really rough waves and sitting there vomiting over the side
[2:13:38.000 --> 2:13:40.000]  while you're reeling in giant fish.
[2:13:40.000 --> 2:13:44.000]  Can you imagine that 4,000 plus miles?
[2:13:44.000 --> 2:13:48.000]  And they finally pulled up at two islands and natives would run up and bash their brains out
[2:13:48.000 --> 2:13:54.000]  and be gobbling their brains as they rode out to sea while the natives were, you know,
[2:13:54.000 --> 2:14:01.000]  beating whoever they could grab to death with rocks and spears.
[2:14:01.000 --> 2:14:02.000]  And then I think about myself.
[2:14:02.000 --> 2:14:03.000]  I am weak.
[2:14:03.000 --> 2:14:04.000]  I am pathetic.
[2:14:04.000 --> 2:14:06.000]  I am not tough.
[2:14:06.000 --> 2:14:13.000]  And then I compare myself to other people, the decadent weakness.
[2:14:13.000 --> 2:14:16.000]  I mean, our ancestors were strong.
[2:14:16.000 --> 2:14:20.000]  And I don't care if you were an African or a guy from England, it didn't matter.
[2:14:20.000 --> 2:14:23.000]  I mean, our ancestors were strong.
[2:14:23.000 --> 2:14:29.000]  The most pathetic of them may not have even been physically as strong as we are today,
[2:14:29.000 --> 2:14:38.000]  but mentally they were tough as nails.
[2:14:38.000 --> 2:14:40.000]  And they were also ready to die.
[2:14:40.000 --> 2:14:44.000]  I mean, if somebody challenged their honor or if somebody got in their face or if some bureaucrat
[2:14:44.000 --> 2:14:51.000]  tried to push them around, they didn't care if they beat some corrupt constable's brains in
[2:14:51.000 --> 2:14:55.000]  and that would mean in a week later they'd be hanging from a pole,
[2:14:55.000 --> 2:14:59.000]  and they would just go ahead and beat his brains out if he tried to shove them around.
[2:14:59.000 --> 2:15:02.000]  Now, before that, there were periods where that wasn't the case.
[2:15:02.000 --> 2:15:07.000]  And when we go through these periods, but where there is plenty, you have decadence
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:09.000]  and men become monsters.
[2:15:09.000 --> 2:15:12.000]  Where you have hardship, men become incredible.
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:17.000]  That is the law of nature.
[2:15:17.000 --> 2:15:19.000]  And I just think about who we are.
[2:15:19.000 --> 2:15:21.000]  And I think about how they've trained us to fight with ourselves.
[2:15:21.000 --> 2:15:25.000]  Men and women, husband and wives, when you fight with each other,
[2:15:25.000 --> 2:15:27.000]  when you get into hating each other, the new world order wins.
[2:15:27.000 --> 2:15:32.000]  When you get lazy and don't take care of your children and don't make sure they grow up straight and strong,
[2:15:32.000 --> 2:15:34.000]  you give in to the new world order.
[2:15:34.000 --> 2:15:36.000]  I mean, stop watching TV.
[2:15:36.000 --> 2:15:38.000]  Stop caring so much about entertainment.
[2:15:38.000 --> 2:15:42.000]  Stop being so decadent.
[2:15:42.000 --> 2:15:45.000]  And it doesn't mean you're going to be a man or a woman overnight,
[2:15:45.000 --> 2:15:51.000]  but if it means your kids are spoiled brats drinking all this sugar and caffeine and acting bad
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:55.000]  and watching 10 hours of TV a day, stop letting them watch TV.
[2:15:55.000 --> 2:15:56.000]  They're throwing fits.
[2:15:56.000 --> 2:16:00.000]  Don't take them to a shrink to put deadly prozac or riddling in them.
[2:16:00.000 --> 2:16:04.000]  You take them out to march up and down the mountains and here in Austin.
[2:16:04.000 --> 2:16:06.000]  And don't tell me you can't.
[2:16:06.000 --> 2:16:07.000]  You don't be lazy.
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:10.000]  When they get home from school, you drag them out there with you
[2:16:10.000 --> 2:16:14.000]  and you take them out in the hill country or wherever you live and you march them five, six miles.
[2:16:14.000 --> 2:16:17.000]  They don't like it.
[2:16:17.000 --> 2:16:18.000]  You discipline them.
[2:16:18.000 --> 2:16:19.000]  You get them in shape.
[2:16:19.000 --> 2:16:21.000]  You get their mind straight.
[2:16:21.000 --> 2:16:23.000]  But you know what?
[2:16:23.000 --> 2:16:26.000]  All this sickness, all this decadence is coming to an end.
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:28.000]  And in a sick way, I'm kind of ready for it.
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:31.000]  In a sick, I mean, it's not really sick.
[2:16:31.000 --> 2:16:32.000]  I'm ready to purge.
[2:16:32.000 --> 2:16:37.000]  What do you think diarrhea is when you got a stomach virus or bacteria
[2:16:37.000 --> 2:16:40.000]  and it's killing you and your gut, your body purges it out.
[2:16:40.000 --> 2:16:42.000]  Your body pushes it out of you.
[2:16:42.000 --> 2:16:45.000]  You think that's what's making you sick.
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:48.000]  No, that's your body getting better.
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:54.000]  And instead, we are like an 800-pound man who's 700 pounds crap.
[2:16:54.000 --> 2:16:56.000]  I'm sorry to use that analogy, but that's what it is.
[2:16:56.000 --> 2:17:00.000]  We are a giant bag of refuse.
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:06.000]  A giant bag of decadent scum, myself included.
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:12.000]  But I do, I tower above most men and I am a lowly worm.
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:18.000]  That's what freaks me out so much.
[2:17:18.000 --> 2:17:21.000]  The Chinese are going to eat our lunch, folks.
[2:17:21.000 --> 2:17:26.000]  The Latin Americans are going to eat our lunch and are eating our lunch.
[2:17:26.000 --> 2:17:27.000]  They're hungry.
[2:17:27.000 --> 2:17:28.000]  We're not.
[2:17:28.000 --> 2:17:31.000]  I don't care what color you are in this country.
[2:17:31.000 --> 2:17:34.000]  We're in deep trouble because we just don't have a depression coming on.
[2:17:34.000 --> 2:17:40.000]  We got a sadistic control freak, eugenics, mad government running things
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:47.000]  who could give a blood nickel for you and your freedom.
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:50.000]  And I want to say this, you know, I try to do the best I can.
[2:17:50.000 --> 2:17:52.000]  I try to be effective against the New World Order,
[2:17:52.000 --> 2:17:55.000]  but I don't calculate what I'm going to do and I got to say this.
[2:17:55.000 --> 2:17:57.000]  And it doesn't mean I won't screw up again.
[2:17:57.000 --> 2:18:00.000]  It doesn't mean I won't do things that are bad and destructive again.
[2:18:00.000 --> 2:18:04.000]  In the whole, judge me by my fruits, I'm doing good.
[2:18:04.000 --> 2:18:05.000]  Who could deny it?
[2:18:05.000 --> 2:18:07.000]  You will know them by their fruits.
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:15.000]  But in the final equation, I do more good than bad, but I also do a lot of harm.
[2:18:15.000 --> 2:18:19.000]  And so I'm going to start analyzing the things I do wrong on air.
[2:18:19.000 --> 2:18:22.000]  The things I've thought about privately a thousand times I do,
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:25.000]  but then when I get on air, I get all hyped up and do it again.
[2:18:25.000 --> 2:18:29.000]  I apologize to the police of this country.
[2:18:29.000 --> 2:18:37.000]  I apologize for the way I've conducted myself and the things I've done and the things I've said,
[2:18:37.000 --> 2:18:43.000]  because my relations with the police in many respects has caused greater damage.
[2:18:43.000 --> 2:18:47.000]  And so I need to set about rectifying that.
[2:18:47.000 --> 2:18:49.000]  And I'll explain after the break what I mean by that.
[2:18:49.000 --> 2:19:00.000]  I apologize to Americans who are listening to the show, whether you're black, white, Hispanic, old, young,
[2:19:00.000 --> 2:19:08.000]  because I could have explained myself on the issue of illegal immigration is better
[2:19:08.000 --> 2:19:10.000]  instead of feeding into the Balkanization.
[2:19:10.000 --> 2:19:13.000]  And I'm going to do that when we get back.
[2:19:13.000 --> 2:19:21.000]  And I also apologize to everyone that I haven't articulated what I've always known properly about environmentalism.
[2:19:21.000 --> 2:19:23.000]  So I'll do all three of those briefly when we get back.
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:28.000]  Then Bob Chapman and I promise your calls, Roman, Zana, Jeremy, Chris, Tony,
[2:19:28.000 --> 2:19:32.000]  you didn't get a chance to talk to Governor Ventura, you get a chance to talk to me and Bob Chapman.
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:38.000]  But I want to come back and I want to have a heart to heart with all of you because things are too dangerous.
[2:19:38.000 --> 2:19:43.000]  Things are too bad, things are too perilous to screw around anymore.
[2:19:43.000 --> 2:19:48.000]  We got to gut up and we got to do the right thing now, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:19:48.000 --> 2:19:50.000]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[2:19:50.000 --> 2:19:56.000]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you,
[2:19:56.000 --> 2:19:58.000]  but the symptoms are there.
[2:19:58.000 --> 2:20:02.000]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[2:20:02.000 --> 2:20:06.000]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[2:20:06.000 --> 2:20:12.000]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[2:20:12.000 --> 2:20:16.000]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[2:20:16.000 --> 2:20:20.000]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[2:20:20.000 --> 2:20:23.000]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[2:20:23.000 --> 2:20:28.000]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[2:20:28.000 --> 2:20:31.000]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[2:20:48.000 --> 2:20:52.000]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[2:20:52.000 --> 2:20:55.000]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals
[2:20:55.000 --> 2:20:58.000]  while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[2:20:58.000 --> 2:21:03.000]  Because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[2:21:03.000 --> 2:21:07.000]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water
[2:21:07.000 --> 2:21:10.000]  and is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron,
[2:21:10.000 --> 2:21:14.000]  and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus.
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:20.000]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[2:21:20.000 --> 2:21:26.000]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[2:21:47.000 --> 2:21:52.000]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[2:21:52.000 --> 2:21:58.000]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[2:21:58.000 --> 2:22:04.000]  It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[2:22:04.000 --> 2:22:10.000]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS revenue ruling 6045 of 1984
[2:22:10.000 --> 2:22:14.000]  and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's executive order of 1933,
[2:22:14.000 --> 2:22:18.000]  some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[2:22:18.000 --> 2:22:23.000]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:30.000]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:34.000]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.

[2:22:40.000 --> 2:22:48.000]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately. 1-800-686-2237.
[2:22:48.000 --> 2:22:56.000]  On September 11, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do.
[2:22:56.000 --> 2:22:57.000]  At least we thought we did.
[2:22:57.000 --> 2:23:04.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:23:04.000 --> 2:23:13.000]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:23:13.000 --> 2:23:20.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:23:20.000 --> 2:23:23.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:23:23.000 --> 2:23:29.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear it three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:23:29.000 --> 2:23:36.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[2:23:36.000 --> 2:23:41.000]  and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:23:41.000 --> 2:24:06.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:24:06.000 --> 2:24:13.000]  Here I come now, baby. Come on, come on, come on, baby.
[2:24:13.000 --> 2:24:22.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. Waging war on corruption, crashing with lies and disinformation.
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:28.000]  Oh, it's real talk radio. Real issues that actually affect you, your country, your family.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:42.000]  The enemy is moving upon us right now. If we expose them whatever before, they will be discredited and fall.
[2:24:42.000 --> 2:24:48.000]  I've seen the blood. I know we're bloodying them. We're hurting them bad.
[2:24:48.000 --> 2:24:54.000]  Keep stabbing the Leviathan. We're going to kill it by a thousand cuts.
[2:24:54.000 --> 2:25:01.000]  Know you're hitting paydirt, boys, and don't stop.
[2:25:01.000 --> 2:25:06.000]  When you're in a fight for your life, you don't think about it. You just give it all.
[2:25:06.000 --> 2:25:13.000]  Just keep swinging those picks, those daggers, those battle axes, and the info war right into the enemy.
[2:25:13.000 --> 2:25:25.000]  Put every bit of sinew you got into it. This Leviathan is going to fall.
[2:25:25.000 --> 2:25:37.000]  I'm going to flesh this out in the days to come, but simply put, getting on air and yelling and screaming about the police being thugs only compacts them deeper into their gang mentality.
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:49.000]  The behavioral psychologists that are federalized and twisted our police forces know that as they become more corrupt and more authoritarian, that that will cause the public to hate them.
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:57.000]  Then the public hating them and going against them will compact them more into their gang psychology and make them only serve the system more.
[2:25:57.000 --> 2:26:00.000]  We're going up against sophisticated psychology here.
[2:26:00.000 --> 2:26:09.000]  Flipping out on the police is wrong. I should hold out good examples of good police and good examples of good sheriffs and whether or not being federalized.
[2:26:09.000 --> 2:26:21.000]  I should point out how the police are being victimized, brainwashed, conditioned. I should go through how they're being lied to, explain how they're being manipulated, explain how it endangers them.
[2:26:21.000 --> 2:26:39.000]  But I get lazy. I get angry about what's happening and I just do what's easy and start when I see footage of police beating somebody up on the highway because they ask questions or choking them or whatever for no reason and then the police wrongfully charge them.
[2:26:39.000 --> 2:26:43.000]  I get mad and call them criminals and those individuals are criminals.
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:55.000]  But we need to point out how they're criminals and go over it instead of just blowing up with the shorthand of, oh, they're a bunch of scum and they're enemies of the American people.
[2:26:55.000 --> 2:27:03.000]  No, they are being used by the New World Order and we need to show them how and why.
[2:27:03.000 --> 2:27:13.000]  And the same thing goes with the illegal aliens. The illegal aliens are in a hellish third world country that our elites have been controlling and manipulating with the Mexican elites.
[2:27:13.000 --> 2:27:20.000]  Horrible things have been done to them. Their elites know they're going to get angry and fight back so they then blame it on the people of the U.S. as to scapegoat.
[2:27:20.000 --> 2:27:29.000]  The U.S. did take about a third of its territory, about half of Mexico's territory, about a third of our territory comes from that.
[2:27:29.000 --> 2:27:36.000]  Mexico didn't truly hold it, had no real claim to it, but neither did the U.S. such as the law of empires.
[2:27:36.000 --> 2:27:47.000]  Now we need to reach out to the Mexican people and explain to them how they're being manipulated and how they're being used against the United States.
[2:27:47.000 --> 2:27:56.000]  We need to explain to the American people that it's not that we're against the illegal aliens because that's what it's turning into, it's just a hate of Mexicans.
[2:27:56.000 --> 2:28:03.000]  And that is, we are against them being used as a tool of driving down our wages and destroying our republic.
[2:28:03.000 --> 2:28:09.000]  Because we can't get down to the level, even if a lot of the illegal aliens have been taught to hate gringos, which a lot of them do, let's be honest about it.
[2:28:09.000 --> 2:28:15.000]  It's all over radio and TV. We need to be above that and explain to those people, you have a lot of reasons to hate us.
[2:28:15.000 --> 2:28:20.000]  We've been scapegoated and explain to them the more sophisticated plan by the New World Order.
[2:28:20.000 --> 2:28:31.000]  Because if we could make Mexico a free country, if we could ever root out the corruption there, and it's coming to a head there as well, and if we could ever let them take their country over, it'd be more wealthy than the United States.
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:41.000]  Instead, the globalists have a deal where they export their revolution and their criminals here, which helps bring down the U.S. while it keeps the Mexican government in power.
[2:28:41.000 --> 2:28:52.000]  And then with the environmentalism, the New World Order is very, very good at hijacking and co-opting things that make a lot of sense.
[2:28:52.000 --> 2:28:57.000]  And the environment is in a crisis, and I mean in a crisis for humans.
[2:28:57.000 --> 2:29:03.000]  The toxic waste, the genetic engineering, the clear cutting, the overfishing is hurting humans' future.
[2:29:03.000 --> 2:29:12.000]  I mean we're affected by the dioxin, by the toxic waste, by the chimeras, the genetic engineering, by the hybrid creations.
[2:29:12.000 --> 2:29:20.000]  And I need to clearly make the point that a lot of the stuff you hear the environmentalists doing is sensible and reasonable.
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:32.000]  The problem is it's been co-opted, and instead of focusing on real environmental issues, we're going to be co-opted into supporting global carbon taxes, which will actually cause more toxic waste dumping.
[2:29:32.000 --> 2:29:37.000]  I'll explain when we get back, and then we'll go to Bob Chapman in your phone calls. Stay with us.

[2:33:32.000 --> 2:33:43.000]  And you could argue that was real environmentalism. You know, starve people to death, totally make them live in horrible conditions, but it was a tool of control.
[2:33:43.000 --> 2:33:54.000]  And then you had the Rockefellers and others, and about 110 years ago, the Carnegie Endowment, the British World Family, and others fund modern conservation and environmentalism.
[2:33:54.000 --> 2:34:06.000]  And a lot of it sounds reasonable, don't overfish, don't cut down all the old growth forest, and then they get you to believe in that and push for that.
[2:34:06.000 --> 2:34:14.000]  You know, it's easy to sell a good product, but then it becomes something to steal private property and not pay market value for, and then they build on it.
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:19.000]  Then it becomes something to get around the Constitution and bill of rights.
[2:34:19.000 --> 2:34:25.000]  And they use environmentalism right here. The city council stole tens of thousands of acres from people, wouldn't pay a market value.
[2:34:25.000 --> 2:34:34.000]  They paid them about ten cents on the dollar, and they turned around, took the building restrictions off and built golf courses and luxury hotels and million-dollar houses.
[2:34:34.000 --> 2:34:41.000]  From the ranchers and people they stole it from. That's a micro example of smart growth.
[2:34:41.000 --> 2:34:49.000]  And here's an example of how they're selling the global warming fraud, and it is a fraud. The earth heats up, it cools down.
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:58.000]  A hot earth with higher levels of carbon dioxide in every major study shows more life, more plankton, more trees, more animal life. It's good.
[2:34:58.000 --> 2:35:03.000]  We've been in an oxygen and carbon dioxide-starved level.
[2:35:03.000 --> 2:35:07.000]  So you have all these thousands of real environmental things that are going on.
[2:35:07.000 --> 2:35:16.000]  Genetic engineering, cross-species that's hurting the entire biosphere, jumping in plants and animals that aren't even part of the experiment, hurting humans.
[2:35:16.000 --> 2:35:22.000]  No doubt these GMO foods were eating that have had their major DNA changed, very toxic.
[2:35:22.000 --> 2:35:32.000]  I mean, they can make a potato last longer and taste better, but by the way, it's got new factors in it, new proteins that never existed in any part of any other life form.
[2:35:32.000 --> 2:35:39.000]  And it's totally toxic to your body and hurts you. That's just one example of thousands.
[2:35:39.000 --> 2:35:47.000]  So see, none of that's being dealt with. None of that's being talked about. It's all carbon footprint, carbon footprint, carbon footprint, carbon footprint.
[2:35:47.000 --> 2:35:53.000]  And you pull up to Office Depot and they got signs up, you can't park here, only low emission cars.
[2:35:53.000 --> 2:36:11.000]  So see, instead of having true environmentalism about what's hurting us, like dumping docks and in the air, coal-fired plants that are dirty coal, which are filled with mercury, the government blocked all the major clean coal mines in Utah, so we have to burn dirty coal now.
[2:36:11.000 --> 2:36:20.000]  I mean, it's incredible what's going on. All this real environmental issues that we have going on, but none of that will be dealt with.
[2:36:20.000 --> 2:36:29.000]  It's all going to be about carbon taxes, which in the Club of Rome, CFR, UN, they all admit it's a fraud. They laugh at us.
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:38.000]  They write books saying it, saying, we're going to 20, 30, 40 years ago they were saying this, we're going to tell them there's an ice age or global warming, depending on what the trend is.
[2:36:38.000 --> 2:36:45.000]  And we're going to tax them and have a world tax and people will pay taxes, carbon credits, into the private central banks.
[2:36:45.000 --> 2:36:52.000]  I told you for years they do that, because I was reading what they say they do, and now people are going, Alex Jones was right again.
[2:36:52.000 --> 2:36:58.000]  They're proposing buying credits from the private banks. That makes them the global government.
[2:36:58.000 --> 2:37:03.000]  And they're not fighting Al Qaeda, or they're not fighting some other imaginary enemy to get us to rally around them.
[2:37:03.000 --> 2:37:08.000]  They're fighting the saving the earth from the scourged humanity.
[2:37:08.000 --> 2:37:15.000]  Meanwhile, let's look. Let's go ahead and believe them that global warming is caused by carbon dioxide and carbon dioxide is a bad thing.
[2:37:15.000 --> 2:37:19.000]  It's a toxic waste. It's not. Plants breathe it, but let's just go with the fraud.
[2:37:19.000 --> 2:37:32.000]  They're going to put in carbon taxes in about 25 western nations, from New Zealand to Canada, the US to England, from Greenland to places like Germany.
[2:37:32.000 --> 2:37:38.000]  And all that will do is make all the industry go to India, go to China, go to Mexico, where there's no controls.
[2:37:38.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  And they admit that. And the globalists have said, not only is it a tax, it's a way to further deindustrialize and gain control over the middle classes.
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:53.000]  Okay? So that's what's going on. Now, how do you explain that to some liberal?
[2:37:53.000 --> 2:38:00.000]  You walk up to them, they're not really a liberal. They're believing a false corporate fraud paradigm they've downloaded, basically.
[2:38:00.000 --> 2:38:09.000]  If you walk up and say global warming's bull, they immediately think you're George Bush attacking Iran and Iraq, lying and torturing and getting rid of the Fourth Amendment.
[2:38:09.000 --> 2:38:19.000]  See, by Bush coming out and saying he was against the greenhouse gas taxes while he actually put them all in place.
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:28.000]  What he was able to do, that then made Europe and liberals here think, my God, Bush lies about everything else.
[2:38:28.000 --> 2:38:32.000]  It must be real. I better get behind this.
[2:38:32.000 --> 2:38:45.000]  Just like when conservatives would see Bill Clinton handing over ports to the communist Chinese military, they would freak out and think, my God, Republicans must be good and then run join them.
[2:38:45.000 --> 2:38:57.000]  See, that's how the left-right paradigm works. The left feeds the right. The right feeds the left in their fear, keeping the two groups separate but combined into the same false paradigm tied up together.
[2:38:57.000 --> 2:39:10.000]  And so, Republican policies reinforce the left and Democratic liberal policies reinforce the right, whether it's in Germany or England or the US or Australia, it doesn't matter.
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:14.000]  This is a dialectic. This is a system of control.
[2:39:14.000 --> 2:39:20.000]  And so everybody sees real environmental problems. People dying of cancer when they're 15 years old everywhere.
[2:39:20.000 --> 2:39:30.000]  leukemias weigh up, all these other things weigh up, autism, people unhealthy, all these new diseases, all these toxicities, all these superfund sites.
[2:39:30.000 --> 2:39:35.000]  And then they hear the solutions of global tax and they say, my God, I'm for it.
[2:39:35.000 --> 2:39:46.000]  How do you approach somebody and go, look, here's how the trick works. Bush comes out against it and then you know he's a bad guy and wrong on every other policy so you think, oh my gosh, it must be good.
[2:39:46.000 --> 2:39:51.000]  I'm for global warming tax.
[2:39:51.000 --> 2:39:58.000]  You see, just like Bush is so bad, well the left all must be good so maybe gun control is good if Bush is against it.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:40:02.000]  But in reality, he tripled the size of the BATF and is coming after your guns.
[2:40:02.000 --> 2:40:05.000]  You see, that's why you've got to get out of the left-right paradigm.
[2:40:05.000 --> 2:40:15.000]  We're not going to save the environment and it's in trouble, folks, unless we can not let them co-opt us into their false solution of taxing greenhouse gas.
[2:40:15.000 --> 2:40:23.000]  I hope all of this is getting through to you, okay?
[2:40:23.000 --> 2:40:33.000]  They're going to tax your breathing while they engineer grasses, oaks, every food plant, every animal, crossing it with other insects and other animals.
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:44.000]  Hundreds of human hybrids, goat hybrids, pig hybrids, cow hybrids, horse hybrids, dog hybrids, jellyfish humanoid hybrids.
[2:40:44.000 --> 2:40:53.000]  I mean, type in human animal hybrid into Google and all the National Geographic, AP Reuters, BBC, you tell the person on the street that they don't believe it exists.
[2:40:53.000 --> 2:41:01.000]  Because they've been taught to fear carbon dioxide, not cross-species hybrids that give rise to superviruses.
[2:41:01.000 --> 2:41:10.000]  That then go into bacteria and give you super-mutated bacteria already killing bees, killing trees, killing the ocean, mutating plankton.
[2:41:10.000 --> 2:41:17.000]  I mean, this is, oh my God, we can't worry about something real.
[2:41:17.000 --> 2:41:19.000]  We can't worry about overfishing.
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:23.000]  We can't worry about anything real or chopping down rainforest.
[2:41:23.000 --> 2:41:28.000]  We've just got to tax carbon dioxide.
[2:41:28.000 --> 2:41:32.000]  All right, we're going to Bob Chapman and I got all this other news here.
[2:41:32.000 --> 2:41:43.000]  He'll be ready for the rest of the show or until about 45 after next hour. Your calls are coming up, I promise, at 1-800-259-9231 on any issue with Bob Chapman, but especially the economy.
[2:41:43.000 --> 2:41:56.000]  Bob, I want you to recap what we've seen happen the last week with Indy Bank, with Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and then walk us through the basics.
[2:41:56.000 --> 2:42:02.000]  Recap the basics and then look at what solutions to this would be, but we know that's not going to happen.
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:04.000]  So where this is going to go?
[2:42:04.000 --> 2:42:12.000]  And so we can't have big solutions to fix the major problems, which he says too late and I agree, but to have a softer landing than what we can do individually.
[2:42:12.000 --> 2:42:15.000]  Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, thank you for joining us.
[2:42:15.000 --> 2:42:19.000]  And if you'd like, you can comment on the environmental rant I was just engaging in.
[2:42:19.000 --> 2:42:27.000]  No, I thought you covered it brilliantly. Some of the things that you spoke about, I wasn't aware of.
[2:42:27.000 --> 2:42:38.000]  And I think you've got a great grasp on it and I think the listeners should be happy that you're able to present it in a concise form that way.
[2:42:38.000 --> 2:42:51.000]  As far as what's going on in the financial markets, we can reach back almost a year now. When the exposure came, there was a credit crisis.
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:57.000]  Needless to say, it had been building for the last couple of years prior to that.
[2:42:57.000 --> 2:43:03.000]  And since then, they really accomplished very little in solving that crisis.
[2:43:03.000 --> 2:43:17.000]  We've seen a commercial and residential real estate fall in value in degrees, depending upon where you are and how much your real estate went up.
[2:43:17.000 --> 2:43:35.000]  We've seen a tremendous fraud uncovered with the sale of mortgage bonds called CDOs and SIVs and the mislabeling them of AAA.
[2:43:35.000 --> 2:43:48.000]  One, in fact, they were triple B with a difference between a 10 and a 4. And now we're starting to see the falling out of banking structure.
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:54.000]  We saw the financial assassination of the Bear Stearns. They never had to go under.
[2:43:54.000 --> 2:44:01.000]  That was the machinations of those on Wall Street in conjunction with the Federal Reserve, which Wall Street owns.
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:21.000]  And we then saw beginnings of institutions going under, and that came with the mortgage companies first, and then there were some 235 or 50 of them that went down.
[2:44:21.000 --> 2:44:28.000]  Then that was followed by IndieMac. IndieMac happened on Friday after the close of the market.
[2:44:28.000 --> 2:44:36.000]  That's usually when they do those things. And they've known for a long time that there was a serious problem there, just like they did with Countrywide.
[2:44:36.000 --> 2:44:42.000]  And they had one of their shareholders, Bank of America, step in and buy Countrywide.
[2:44:42.000 --> 2:44:51.000]  And by the looks of things, the purchase of Countrywide may end up taking Bank of America down in time as well.
[2:44:51.000 --> 2:45:03.000]  And so IndieMac is, like Countrywide, become emblematic of the decline of particularly residential housing.
[2:45:03.000 --> 2:45:14.000]  And it's got a long way to go. I saw a couple of articles that said in the last couple of days, especially one today in the Chicago Tribune,
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:24.000]  relating that the subprime alter mortgage problem will be over this month, not in their wildest dreams.
[2:45:24.000 --> 2:45:30.000]  That particular segment of the market has got until the end of next June to go.
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:34.000]  And all during that period, it's going to be nasty. On top of that, you have the...
[2:45:34.000 --> 2:45:39.000]  Well, Bob, stop there. I didn't want to interrupt you because I wanted you to go over all this, but that was in my list of things to ask.
[2:45:39.000 --> 2:45:44.000]  This is the same group that told us six months ago with Bear Stearns that this was the end of the downturn.
[2:45:44.000 --> 2:45:49.000]  And they knew the whole time because I was reading some of their internal stuff that leaks out.
[2:45:49.000 --> 2:45:51.000]  They were saying, get ready for curtains.
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:54.000]  Meanwhile, they're telling the people everything's great.
[2:45:54.000 --> 2:45:57.000]  That makes them lose more confidence, doesn't it?
[2:45:57.000 --> 2:46:03.000]  Doesn't that make the people trust them even less that the fact that they can never tell us the truth?
[2:46:03.000 --> 2:46:05.000]  Doesn't that deepen the crises?
[2:46:05.000 --> 2:46:11.000]  Yes, it does. And it brings more people to recognition of what's going on.
[2:46:11.000 --> 2:46:13.000]  And it also...
[2:46:13.000 --> 2:46:15.000]  So why do they lie?
[2:46:15.000 --> 2:46:17.000]  Because they have no other choice.
[2:46:17.000 --> 2:46:25.000]  They have just decimated the financial and economic system through their greed more than anything else.
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:40.000]  And they also want to, as you explained when you talked about environmentalism, that they want to denude the western nations of manufacturing capability
[2:46:40.000 --> 2:46:44.000]  so they can handle them better, bring them down to a lower level.
[2:46:44.000 --> 2:46:50.000]  And it's the same thing in the financial and economic overall sphere.
[2:46:50.000 --> 2:46:55.000]  And so we're looking at all these fallouts.
[2:46:55.000 --> 2:47:02.000]  And from here on out, you're probably going to see a few hundred banks go under, maybe even more.
[2:47:02.000 --> 2:47:07.000]  And the FDIC is 52 billion in round figures.
[2:47:07.000 --> 2:47:17.000]  And this buyout saving of Indy Mac is going to cost somewhere around six or eight billion dollars.
[2:47:17.000 --> 2:47:20.000]  So it's a good chunk of the money that they had.
[2:47:20.000 --> 2:47:32.000]  And I noticed that, and they didn't say how, but they said those who had more than a hundred thousand dollars in their accounts would be compensated in time.
[2:47:32.000 --> 2:47:41.000]  I don't know whether it's this century or the next, but anyway, we've been telling people to take any monies out of banks that were over a hundred thousand
[2:47:41.000 --> 2:47:51.000]  and to think twice about even keeping a hundred thousand in a bank because I think many of them because of this toxic waste in the form of mortgage bonds
[2:47:51.000 --> 2:47:59.000]  that they're holding and other loans as well and credit card loans and everything else that many, many banks are going to be under pressure.
[2:47:59.000 --> 2:48:04.000]  That's a good question, Bob. How do you analyze your bank because they all lie so much in their financials?
[2:48:04.000 --> 2:48:11.000]  How do you analyze if a bank's a good place to have your dollar, which is already being stolen by inflation?
[2:48:11.000 --> 2:48:18.000]  Well, there are services that do that, and we have one that we recommend to people and they charge a small fee,
[2:48:18.000 --> 2:48:27.000]  which I think is understandable and worthwhile to find out what their rating on such and such a bank is.
[2:48:27.000 --> 2:48:36.000]  But I think the main thing is that you don't want to have a lot of cash around unless you've got a business or something like that.
[2:48:36.000 --> 2:48:42.000]  And even if you've got a business, if you're using a bank, you're going to have to use several banks if you've got like a half a million.
[2:48:42.000 --> 2:48:49.000]  You should have five accounts with a hundred thousand each in them just to protect yourself.
[2:48:49.000 --> 2:48:59.000]  And people who don't need a great cash flow or money sitting there behind them, I think they should be considering gold and silver related assets.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:09.000]  And for those who already have a lot of those or don't want any, the only alternative I can see is Swiss rank government bonds.
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:21.000]  And they yield two, two and a half percent as strong as currency in the world, and they do have enough gold to back the currency if they choose to again.
[2:49:21.000 --> 2:49:24.000]  And so that is that alternative.
[2:49:24.000 --> 2:49:30.000]  So I don't have many things to offer just gold and silver related assets and those bonds.
[2:49:30.000 --> 2:49:32.000]  And there's not many places to go.
[2:49:32.000 --> 2:49:34.000]  I think the stock market's going lower.
[2:49:34.000 --> 2:49:38.000]  I think interest rates are going higher in the real interest rate market.
[2:49:38.000 --> 2:49:39.000]  I was thinking about this.
[2:49:39.000 --> 2:49:40.000]  We'll go down.
[2:49:40.000 --> 2:49:51.000]  You said here in late 2007, you said in the seventh month, and that's now Oregon, you said in July, you'll see banks start going under.
[2:49:51.000 --> 2:49:53.000]  And I get confused.
[2:49:53.000 --> 2:49:54.000]  I mean, I know you're the expert.
[2:49:54.000 --> 2:49:55.000]  That's why I get confused.
[2:49:55.000 --> 2:49:59.000]  But you're saying it's going to take longer, a couple more years for the depression to hit.
[2:49:59.000 --> 2:50:05.000]  But then you were right on about the earnings coming in, the news coming in now, this happening now.
[2:50:05.000 --> 2:50:08.000]  I just don't see this going out another two and a half years.
[2:50:08.000 --> 2:50:10.000]  Well, I know you don't.
[2:50:10.000 --> 2:50:17.000]  And I think it's because you probably haven't been doing this for 50 years and you gain patience.
[2:50:17.000 --> 2:50:22.000]  And not only that, you recognize the power that the Illuminati has.
[2:50:22.000 --> 2:50:25.000]  I mean, the control of the press strings of the entire world.
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:28.000]  And they're fighting to stay alive.
[2:50:28.000 --> 2:50:30.000]  They're fighting to keep the system going.
[2:50:30.000 --> 2:50:37.000]  And they're going to draw it out as long as they can or until a time has reached when they want it to go down.
[2:50:37.000 --> 2:50:40.000]  And drawing it out makes it worse for us, doesn't it?
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:42.000]  No, it makes it worse for everybody.
[2:50:42.000 --> 2:50:44.000]  Because all those guys...
[2:50:44.000 --> 2:50:48.000]  I tell you, we're going to skip this break, Bob. Stay there. We're going to talk to Bob.
[2:50:48.000 --> 2:50:51.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[2:50:51.000 --> 2:50:56.000]  I've come with a message of information. 9-11 was an inside job.
[2:50:56.000 --> 2:50:59.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[2:50:59.000 --> 2:51:02.000]  I'll do it. The American people know that 9-11 was a state.
[2:51:02.000 --> 2:51:07.000]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.A.F.R.
[2:51:07.000 --> 2:51:15.000]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[2:51:15.000 --> 2:51:21.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:51:21.000 --> 2:51:25.000]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:51:25.000 --> 2:51:31.000]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:51:31.000 --> 2:51:34.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[2:51:34.000 --> 2:51:56.000]  Life has changed. We're not 21 anymore. We have responsibilities.
[2:51:56.000 --> 2:51:59.000]  That's why there's drinking made hangover defense.
[2:51:59.000 --> 2:52:06.000]  Sure, we've done our share of partying. Now kicking back with the neighbors and a few beers is more our style.
[2:52:06.000 --> 2:52:12.000]  But let's face it, as we get older, even that can leave us feeling run down the next morning.
[2:52:12.000 --> 2:52:17.000]  With drinking made, you can have a few drinks tonight without waking up feeling like you had a few.
[2:52:17.000 --> 2:52:23.000]  Drinking made's patented and proven formula of guava leaf extract has antioxidants and other unique properties
[2:52:23.000 --> 2:52:29.000]  that help prevent the headache, queasy stomach and dehydration even a few drinks can leave behind.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:34.000]  Just dissolve one drinking made in water and take it before bed. It's that easy.
[2:52:34.000 --> 2:52:38.000]  The next morning, bring on the responsibilities.
[2:52:38.000 --> 2:52:43.000]  Drinking made hangover defense is available at retailers nationwide. Pick up some today.
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:48.000]  Remember your drinking made and wake up feeling great.
[2:52:48.000 --> 2:52:53.000]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:16.000]  Bob Chapman is our guest. We just had a behind-the-scenes discussion for the infowars.com viewers.
[2:54:16.000 --> 2:54:23.000]  His website is theinternationalforecaster.com, theinternationalforecaster.com,
[2:54:23.000 --> 2:54:29.000]  and you can go there and get a free digital copy of it. It comes out twice a week, twice a month for hard copies.
[2:54:29.000 --> 2:54:31.000]  Before he leaves us, we'll give you the toll free number to get that.
[2:54:31.000 --> 2:54:34.000]  Before we go back to Bob, I want to thank some of our sponsors.
[2:54:34.000 --> 2:54:39.000]  In the next hour, we're taking your calls for Bob that make this radio show possible.
[2:54:39.000 --> 2:54:44.000]  One of them is inner food. They are the best green food I found out there, bar none.
[2:54:44.000 --> 2:54:50.000]  Inner food botanicals has a whole line of great vitamins and nutrients.
[2:54:50.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  Really, what they are is whole foods, though, that are unpasteurized in a concentrated form in their main line product,
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:54:59.000]  their number one product. That's the inner food. It's a green food.
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:05.000]  You put two little scoops in your orange juice or apple juice every morning, dulse kelp, barley grass, wheat grass,
[2:55:05.000 --> 2:55:12.000]  Carolina spirulina, and 14 other super food ingredients, balance energy all day long,
[2:55:12.000 --> 2:55:17.000]  greater stamina, weight loss, greater mental clarity, reduced food cravings, healthy radiant skin,
[2:55:17.000 --> 2:55:21.000]  helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels. It's just great stuff.
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:28.000]  Go to infowars.com, link through right there on the innerfood.com banner,
[2:55:28.000 --> 2:55:32.000]  because when you link through there, you get 10% off because you're an Alex Jones listener,

[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:48.000]  1-866-762-9238, that number again, 1-866-762-9238.
[2:55:48.000 --> 2:55:53.000]  Now, I know you're holding. You want to talk to Bob Chapman that's coming up early in the next hour,
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:56:00.000]  but right now in the minutes we've got left, Bob, you are continuing to walk through the fact
[2:56:00.000 --> 2:56:06.000]  that this is going to bring everybody down. You agree with the Financial Times of London
[2:56:06.000 --> 2:56:11.000]  saying that this even endangers the overarching order of things.
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:17.000]  They meant this to be the debt pit to capture us. How did they create a weapon, a debt weapon
[2:56:17.000 --> 2:56:21.000]  that now threatens to envelop them?
[2:56:21.000 --> 2:56:28.000]  Well, I think they, and they've done this before, they all overestimated what they could accomplish.
[2:56:28.000 --> 2:56:38.000]  And then, in addition to that, they were very, very surprised at the mess that the Bush administration
[2:56:38.000 --> 2:56:50.000]  and the Blair and now Gordon Brown administration in London made of Iraq and Afghanistan.
[2:56:50.000 --> 2:56:55.000]  And they just, you know, to call Przniski a couple of years ago, he said,
[2:56:55.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  I mean, this is a nightmare. I mean, you know, with all the work we did on this thing,
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:08.000]  and these guys have made a mess out of it, it set back the timetable for World Government by 30 years.
[2:57:08.000 --> 2:57:16.000]  He later said 50. And I'm happy about that. But how did they get in the mess they're in?
[2:57:16.000 --> 2:57:22.000]  So the two factors, they reached too far beyond. And you've got to remember, one of the real problems that they have
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:29.000]  is they are very, very arrogant people. They think they're the lords of the world, the heads of the universe,
[2:57:29.000 --> 2:57:37.000]  if you might, if you might. And they are prone to make those kind of silly mistakes,
[2:57:37.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  because they have a lot of people working with them 24-7 all over the world
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:48.000]  because they have endless supplies of wealth working on their plans for the future.
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:53.000]  And then, of course, Przniski and Kissinger and people like that,
[2:57:53.000 --> 2:57:58.000]  take those plans and put them together and shape them into policy for these people.
[2:57:58.000 --> 2:58:05.000]  And which you've said, Alex, you can find all this. All you have to do is be willing to read and do research.
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:12.000]  I mean, Foreign Affairs is the household of the Council on Foreign Relation. I was a subscriber since 1960.
[2:58:12.000 --> 2:58:16.000]  And what they're going to do, they just print it right out and tell you.
[2:58:16.000 --> 2:58:17.000]  Bob?
[2:58:17.000 --> 2:58:19.000]  And it's part of that arrogance.
[2:58:19.000 --> 2:58:24.000]  We've got a break for 60, 70 seconds. We're going to come back with the fourth and final hour with Bob Chapman
[2:58:24.000 --> 2:58:36.000]  and your phone call. We're going to talk about the Iran situation.
[2:59:15.000 --> 2:59:21.000]  Thousands of special video reports from tainted vaccines to martial law can be found in this online video library.
[2:59:21.000 --> 2:59:26.000]  By weekly news television broadcast, thousands of exclusive audio interviews, and so much more.
[2:59:26.000 --> 2:59:31.000]  The Info War is waiting for you to set it free. Join PrismPlanet.tv.

[2:59:35.000 --> 2:59:58.000]  Bring down the New World Order. PrismPlanet.tv.
[2:59:58.000 --> 3:00:07.000]  To all the police, all the military, all the government people, the general public listening, everything that the patriots have talked about,
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:11.000]  everything we've talked about here has come true and happened.
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:14.000]  You know in your gut we're telling you the truth. You know we're in deep trouble.
[3:00:14.000 --> 3:00:18.000]  Everybody has this feeling of dread, this great concern.
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:26.000]  The media tells you that's your sixth sense, worried about al-Qaeda, al-CIA, but you know the dread is what's happening economically and militarily.
[3:00:26.000 --> 3:00:29.000]  Your call is coming up in the next segment. Bob Chapman, our guest.
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  The largest in the past, Gold and Silverbroker in the world.
[3:00:33.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  The largest newsletter in the world and retired. He's back in the last few years, I guess six, seven, eight years now with International Forecaster.
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:44.000]  And we're honored that he spends so much time with us each week during these crises.
[3:00:44.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  He's one of our best experts we have on, one of many, but they all seem to be agreeing on the basics.
[3:00:49.000 --> 3:00:57.000]  But his insight is even deeper than most, because he also worked in military intelligence before he got into the financials.
[3:00:57.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  Bob, this is a quick segment as you know, but I'm going to skip it for behind the scenes listeners.
[3:01:01.000 --> 3:01:04.000]  So we'll go straight through into the next segment and take calls.
[3:01:04.000 --> 3:01:09.000]  Iran. Bush said Friday, and I've got it right here, Times of London.
[3:01:09.000 --> 3:01:12.000]  He said, I support Israel going ahead and hitting.
[3:01:12.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  Iran publicly said go ahead and hit him.
[3:01:15.000 --> 3:01:20.000]  The Israelis are massing aircraft inside Iraq. Huge provocation.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:29.000]  And it looks like that Ray McGovern and others are right that it's a go sometime in September, October as an October surprise.
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:33.000]  Why are they planning to do this?
[3:01:33.000 --> 3:01:44.000]  Well, I think the main reason is to detract people's minds away from the economic and financial problems that not only beset the United States but the world.
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:55.000]  Because when the doggy, which is the United States, wags its tail, all the world thunders and quakes and trumbles economically and financially.
[3:01:55.000 --> 3:02:05.000]  And so I think it is a move just like Iran and Afghanistan were to get people looking any other direction.
[3:02:05.000 --> 3:02:15.000]  I once met a man from Israel and I said, aren't you concerned about the economic climate that's there?
[3:02:15.000 --> 3:02:18.000]  And he said, no, I'm more concerned about whether I'm going to get killed or not.
[3:02:18.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  And so if you've got these wars going on, people are going to be thinking, well, gee, what's next?
[3:02:23.000 --> 3:02:26.000]  The draft? Maybe I'll have to go do that.
[3:02:26.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  And so that's one of the reasons, of course, they want Iran's oil.
[3:02:31.000 --> 3:02:39.000]  They want to expand and they want Iran to be neutralized, just like they wanted Iraq neutralized.
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  And of course there's the oil production, which the Western oil companies would like to get their hands on.
[3:02:46.000 --> 3:02:55.000]  And that is clouded by the fact that Iran has treaties and agreements with China and Russia.
[3:02:55.000 --> 3:03:00.000]  And the question is, are they going to get involved?
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:03.000]  I don't think that if anybody did, Russia might.
[3:03:03.000 --> 3:03:08.000]  And Israel, if they attack, might get a surprise.
[3:03:08.000 --> 3:03:12.000]  They may be facing Russia as well as Iran.
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:16.000]  And I don't know that, but it could happen.
[3:03:16.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  They could escalate.
[3:03:18.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  And also, Russia has said yesterday that they are contemplating now, even though Poland has backed out of the missile deal,
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  putting them, those missiles, ostensibly, to shoot down Iranian rockets.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:36.000]  One, in fact, it was to threaten Russia.
[3:03:36.000 --> 3:03:43.000]  They said, you know, if you go ahead somewhere over there and you do that, we're going to target all of the major cities in Western Europe,
[3:03:43.000 --> 3:03:45.000]  just like they did during the Cold War.
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:46.000]  You know, that's right.
[3:03:46.000 --> 3:03:48.000]  I mean, think about the rhetoric we're hearing.
[3:03:48.000 --> 3:03:50.000]  Even in the Cold War, they never threatened a nucleus.
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:54.000]  And they've had their top foreign minister and others say, we may go ahead.
[3:03:54.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  If you even put missiles in these countries, we may go ahead and hit them.
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:01.000]  I mean, Russia doesn't just make threats.
[3:04:01.000 --> 3:04:03.000]  They never have.
[3:04:03.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  They do it.
[3:04:05.000 --> 3:04:07.000]  And they're very bright people.
[3:04:07.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  You know, almost all the time I spent in counterintelligence was working against them in the KGB, the NKVD, and Stasi, and other units as well.
[3:04:19.000 --> 3:04:20.000]  And that was a long time ago.
[3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:22.000]  It was 50 years ago.
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:28.000]  But still, my experience has been that they're formidable opponents.
[3:04:31.000 --> 3:04:33.000]  Oh, Bob Chapman.
[3:04:33.000 --> 3:04:35.000]  It's amazing.
[3:04:35.000 --> 3:04:41.000]  We're going to talk behind the scenes for three minutes for the infowars.com listeners and prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[3:04:41.000 --> 3:04:44.000]  We're going to come back and go right to your calls with Bob Chapman.
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:51.000]  Imagine if I'd come to you a couple of years ago and said to you, hey, gasoline prices are going to jump to $5 a gallon.
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:56.000]  And I know a way that we can store several hundred gallons for you a year or two supply of gasoline.
[3:04:56.000 --> 3:04:58.000]  Buy it today at $2 a gallon.
[3:04:58.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  And when it goes to $5 a gallon, you'll be way ahead of the game.
[3:05:01.000 --> 3:05:03.000]  And you probably at the time would have said to me, you're nuts.
[3:05:03.000 --> 3:05:04.000]  Get away.
[3:05:04.000 --> 3:05:05.000]  You're crazy little dick.
[3:05:05.000 --> 3:05:06.000]  Go bye-bye.
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:07.000]  And OK, fine.
[3:05:07.000 --> 3:05:11.000]  Now I'm telling you what's happened to gasoline is happening to food.
[3:05:11.000 --> 3:05:13.000]  Your grocery bill is going to skyrocket.
[3:05:13.000 --> 3:05:18.000]  And you can put bulk foods away at less than half the price of your regular grocery bill.
[3:05:18.000 --> 3:05:23.000]  And by tomorrow standards, that could be at less than fourth of the price or eighth of the price or sixteenth of the price.
[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:25.000]  Hello, I do have an investor's brain or not.
[3:05:25.000 --> 3:05:26.000]  Pay attention.
[3:05:26.000 --> 3:05:30.000]  Storeable foods, bulk foods from the J. Michael Stevens Company.

[3:05:47.000 --> 3:05:50.000]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[3:05:50.000 --> 3:05:53.000]  Tonight, I have a date with a very lovely Rachel.
[3:05:53.000 --> 3:05:56.000]  And today, I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[3:05:56.000 --> 3:06:00.000]  Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.
[3:06:00.000 --> 3:06:03.000]  Online from my desk with WebEx.

[3:06:06.000 --> 3:06:11.000]  I just talk to clients on the phone and they watch what's happening on my desktop from their desktop.
[3:06:11.000 --> 3:06:15.000]  So I can travel the world and still be here for my date tonight with Rachel.

[3:06:45.000 --> 3:06:52.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here and we knew what to do.
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:06:54.000]  Or at least we thought we did.
[3:06:54.000 --> 3:07:01.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:07:01.000 --> 3:07:10.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:07:10.000 --> 3:07:17.000]  The film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:07:17.000 --> 3:07:20.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:07:20.000 --> 3:07:26.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:29.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[3:07:38.000 --> 3:07:40.000]  We don't expose the government-sponsored terror.
[3:07:40.000 --> 3:07:44.000]  They're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:07:44.000 --> 3:07:47.000]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[3:07:47.000 --> 3:07:51.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:07:56.000 --> 3:08:01.000]  So to be clear, Bob, do you think they're really going to hit Iran A?
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:09.000]  And if they are, part A, you know, the second part of the question A,
[3:08:09.000 --> 3:08:16.000]  will they precipitate a staged terror event to blame it on Iran?
[3:08:16.000 --> 3:08:24.000]  Well, number one, I think the possibility of conflict is even money.
[3:08:24.000 --> 3:08:30.000]  Again, we're not behind the scenes, so we know that something very well could happen.
[3:08:30.000 --> 3:08:32.000]  And might very well happen.
[3:08:32.000 --> 3:08:34.000]  On the other hand, maybe it won't.
[3:08:34.000 --> 3:08:36.000]  So I just don't know.
[3:08:36.000 --> 3:08:39.000]  I did know two years ago that they would not.
[3:08:39.000 --> 3:08:45.000]  And about maybe four or five months ago, I changed my mind and I said,
[3:08:45.000 --> 3:08:47.000]  it's a 50-50 chance.
[3:08:47.000 --> 3:08:48.000]  I don't know.
[3:08:48.000 --> 3:08:51.000]  And I just don't have enough intelligence.
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:57.000]  Well, the worsening economic straits, I mean, remember the stock market started going down
[3:08:57.000 --> 3:09:03.000]  and then they staged 9-11 to kind of be an emotional rally around the flag opiate.
[3:09:03.000 --> 3:09:05.000]  And I mean, do you agree with me?
[3:09:05.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  I mean, I believe from the evidence that worsening economic straits encourages them to go ahead and attack.
[3:09:12.000 --> 3:09:15.000]  Well, you get a very valid point.
[3:09:15.000 --> 3:09:19.000]  It's a very important thing to them to misdirect people.
[3:09:19.000 --> 3:09:26.000]  And that does push the odds from perhaps even money to 60-40, 60 that it would happen.
[3:09:26.000 --> 3:09:28.000]  Or maybe 70-30.
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:31.000]  Again, because we're not on the inside, we don't know.
[3:09:31.000 --> 3:09:37.000]  But those are probably the odds now because of the crumbling of the markets
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:43.000]  and the terrible problems of bankruptcies that we're seeing in the United States and in Western Europe.
[3:09:43.000 --> 3:09:46.000]  They tried today to keep the market up.
[3:09:46.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  We've got about an hour to go, 50 minutes.
[3:09:51.000 --> 3:09:54.000]  And the Dow is coming unglued again.
[3:09:54.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  And, you know, every time it does that, they come in the market to try to keep it up to holding off,
[3:10:00.000 --> 3:10:03.000]  you know, the inevitable problem of lower prices.
[3:10:03.000 --> 3:10:07.000]  Now, lower prices are very important to them that they don't happen
[3:10:07.000 --> 3:10:19.000]  because the market is the last vis to visage the stock market of anything that is pliable that will stand up for you.
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:21.000]  And that's not happening anymore.
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  The market has broken down from a fundamental and a technical base,
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:28.000]  and it should have broken down a long time ago.
[3:10:28.000 --> 3:10:30.000]  But it is now.
[3:10:30.000 --> 3:10:38.000]  And so that adds fuel to the fire to have Israel and the United States go in and attack Iran.
[3:10:38.000 --> 3:10:41.000]  But again, will the Russians get involved?
[3:10:41.000 --> 3:10:44.000]  If they do, you get a third world war and they go nuclear.
[3:10:44.000 --> 3:10:51.000]  And Europe, the United States, Russia will have all kinds of casualties.
[3:10:51.000 --> 3:10:53.000]  Well, I agree with you that it's a 60-40.
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:57.000]  If there was any sanity within the elite, it'd be a zero chance.
[3:10:57.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  But the boldness to carry out a complex op like 9-11 shows these are very, very reckless, arrogant people.
[3:11:08.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  And it shows they're into stuff that's spectacular.
[3:11:12.000 --> 3:11:15.000]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, we couldn't be in worse straits.
[3:11:15.000 --> 3:11:18.000]  I mean, Bush has been totally unstable and a nice puppet for the elite.
[3:11:18.000 --> 3:11:24.000]  But now we face Barack Obama and John McCain, both of them equally as bad.
[3:11:24.000 --> 3:11:27.000]  But this is another strike against Obama.
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:31.000]  Arnold Schwarzenegger, political reporting, and they're a good source of news,
[3:11:31.000 --> 3:11:42.000]  a cabinet-level position, which if cabinet is in the succession, I believe that violates the Constitution with foreign born being in the succession line for president.
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:48.000]  Arnold, a very dangerous person, just insane with power lust.
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:51.000]  California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said in an interview aired Sunday
[3:11:51.000 --> 3:11:55.000]  that he would be open to an idea of serving as energy czar in Barack Obama's administration.
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:12:01.000]  Of course, he ran in California on the advisory panel, the Enron scamming,
[3:12:01.000 --> 3:12:06.000]  and then posed and ran on a platform of fighting Enron.
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:08.000]  He's a very corrupt individual.
[3:12:08.000 --> 3:12:19.000]  I mean, just another example of who could, Bob, who could imagine a comic book series where we'd be looking at 2008 with a son of a Nazi who says he wants to be a Nazi dictator,
[3:12:19.000 --> 3:12:31.000]  who's in gay porn, running around with some guy whose dad's a Muslim named Hussein Barack Obama with a nutcase Manchurian candidate who wants our guns for the Republican.
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:34.000]  I mean, this is insane.
[3:12:34.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  It's pure madness.
[3:12:36.000 --> 3:12:38.000]  Only in America.
[3:12:38.000 --> 3:12:40.000]  It's just incredible.
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  And the people who sit back and say, well, I'd rather have him than that guy over there.
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:54.000]  But they don't notice that they're both totally unqualified and one's a Marxist and the other's a fascist.
[3:12:54.000 --> 3:12:57.000]  Well, we get two fascists and one Marxist.
[3:12:57.000 --> 3:12:59.000]  It's madness.
[3:12:59.000 --> 3:13:03.000]  Arnold went on ABC's this week.
[3:13:03.000 --> 3:13:09.000]  He said on television with Stephanopoulos that he wants to give something back being energy czar.
[3:13:09.000 --> 3:13:15.000]  I mean, Arnold made hundreds of millions just in a little council he was in running scams with Enron.
[3:13:15.000 --> 3:13:18.000]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[3:13:18.000 --> 3:13:24.000]  And he's going to run around pushing carbon taxes and tattletale squads.
[3:13:24.000 --> 3:13:28.000]  Oh, my God, we're in a lot of trouble, Bob Chapman.
[3:13:28.000 --> 3:13:36.000]  Well, those tattletale squads are really, really something that I don't listen to your program all the time.
[3:13:36.000 --> 3:13:38.000]  So I don't know how much you've covered it.
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:46.000]  But they've got police and firefighters and paramedics and other people who are out among the public who are employed.
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:53.000]  By government in one form or another, they are now training them to look for suspicious things.
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  In other words, let's buy on everybody.
[3:13:55.000 --> 3:13:57.000]  And that's the shawzi.
[3:13:57.000 --> 3:14:01.000]  Yeah, and it is just dreadful.
[3:14:01.000 --> 3:14:03.000]  I mean, it can't get any worse than that.
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  And by the way, it's a neighbor against neighbor, a child against parents and so on.
[3:14:08.000 --> 3:14:15.000]  Well, and in fact, they give children money to spy on their parents and they have these neighborhood FBI meetings now for six and a half years.
[3:14:15.000 --> 3:14:20.000]  They say, come to the meeting to fight al-Qaeda and you show up and they say, OK, this is a week long course.
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:23.000]  You're fighting al-Qaeda and then it's like an hour on al-Qaeda.
[3:14:23.000 --> 3:14:25.000]  And the rest is, is your neighbor have pot plants?
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:27.000]  Did they spank their kids?
[3:14:27.000 --> 3:14:30.000]  And it's all how to get people in the system.
[3:14:30.000 --> 3:14:34.000]  I mean, Bob, this is what you fought when you were in intelligence, isn't it?
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:37.000]  I mean, isn't this classical tyranny?
[3:14:37.000 --> 3:14:38.000]  Absolutely.
[3:14:38.000 --> 3:14:44.000]  I mean, you mentioned the stasi and that's exactly what they did.
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:52.000]  And now we're finding out who worked for them and they were supposed to be good guys and they were really bad guys.
[3:14:52.000 --> 3:14:57.000]  But you know, the Cold War was another giant scam.
[3:14:57.000 --> 3:15:02.000]  And I, like many, many other people in the 1950s and 60s, got sucked in by it.
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:04.000]  I mean, we didn't know.
[3:15:04.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  I didn't know then.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:10.000]  And I made a mistake like many people did.
[3:15:10.000 --> 3:15:12.000]  But we know today.
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  And that's why at my age, I continue to try to transmit the information to people that they need to look into this.
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:22.000]  They got to know about it.
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:25.000]  They have to know the things that are really affecting their lives.
[3:15:25.000 --> 3:15:27.000]  And by stage, it's compartmentalized.
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:33.000]  You were fighting a real war with their operatives, but at the highest levels, we were giving them the nukes, the food, the money,
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  letting them take over countries because we couldn't be the bad guys then.
[3:15:37.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  The bankers had to have somebody to go around and murder middle classes.
[3:15:40.000 --> 3:15:43.000]  But now we're going to be the bad guys.
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  I think you're right.
[3:15:45.000 --> 3:15:46.000]  It's totally sick.
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:50.000]  It's quite frankly in Europe, particularly Eastern Europe.
[3:15:50.000 --> 3:15:53.000]  The Russians are the good guys.
[3:15:53.000 --> 3:15:55.000]  It's incredible. Let's take calls here.
[3:15:55.000 --> 3:15:58.000]  And of course, they're all just interplaying the part for the bankers.
[3:15:58.000 --> 3:16:00.000]  Roman in California, thanks for holding.
[3:16:00.000 --> 3:16:02.000]  You're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[3:16:02.000 --> 3:16:03.000]  Hello, Alex.
[3:16:03.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  This is Roman from California calling from Info Wars, California.
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:18.000]  Since you brought up Arnold Schwarzenegger, I just want to take everybody back to 1846 in the California Black Belt Flag Revolt.
[3:16:18.000 --> 3:16:20.000]  Give me a favor.
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:21.000]  Turn your radio off.
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:22.000]  This is really blaring.
[3:16:22.000 --> 3:16:23.000]  Oh, is it?
[3:16:23.000 --> 3:16:24.000]  Yeah.
[3:16:24.000 --> 3:16:25.000]  Okay.
[3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:26.000]  Good.
[3:16:26.000 --> 3:16:27.000]  You killed it.
[3:16:27.000 --> 3:16:28.000]  Go ahead.
[3:16:28.000 --> 3:16:29.000]  All right.
[3:16:29.000 --> 3:16:37.000]  Anyway, 1846, California, General Vallejo, instilling charity, trying to steal the gold with public.
[3:16:37.000 --> 3:16:43.000]  And here we have Governor Schwarzenegger running around doing stuff that's 100 times worse.
[3:16:43.000 --> 3:16:44.000]  Absolutely.
[3:16:44.000 --> 3:16:46.000]  And nobody does anything about it.
[3:16:46.000 --> 3:16:48.000]  I hear you, Bob Chapman.
[3:16:48.000 --> 3:17:00.000]  I mean, again, we know he's a puppet, but I mean, having some arrogant know-it-all prance around and rob everybody, it's disgusting.
[3:17:00.000 --> 3:17:06.000]  And, you know, again, it's back to the same thing, the public on paying attention.
[3:17:06.000 --> 3:17:08.000]  If they don't care, there's no evidence.
[3:17:08.000 --> 3:17:11.000]  If they do care, there's no evidence of it.
[3:17:11.000 --> 3:17:18.000]  I recognize some of the major problems in California where I lived for 36 years in the early 1990s.
[3:17:18.000 --> 3:17:23.000]  And I said, I got to get out of here because the tax base was eroding.
[3:17:23.000 --> 3:17:28.000]  They were overwhelmed with people who didn't pay taxes at all.
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:35.000]  And the economy continued to deteriorate.
[3:17:35.000 --> 3:17:37.000]  And most people couldn't see that.
[3:17:37.000 --> 3:17:38.000]  Yup.
[3:17:38.000 --> 3:17:44.000]  But it's getting people to do things, and that's what the gentleman is asking.
[3:17:44.000 --> 3:17:47.000]  And we're full circle.
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:48.000]  We can do what we can do.
[3:17:48.000 --> 3:17:50.000]  I just hope they listen.
[3:17:50.000 --> 3:17:51.000]  Well, Roman, thanks for the call.
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:54.000]  Let me just ask this question of you, Bob.
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:57.000]  We know they've tripled the amount of police.
[3:17:57.000 --> 3:18:00.000]  The bureaucracies are growing at a record pace as we're bankrupt.
[3:18:00.000 --> 3:18:02.000]  There's cops everywhere writing tickets.
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:09.000]  Literally every couple of months, new tax authorities show up out of nowhere at my business demanding new taxes,
[3:18:09.000 --> 3:18:16.000]  trying to force their way in to look at everything and look at our books with no judge, no warrant.
[3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:18.000]  And they're doing it to everybody, not just me.
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:20.000]  I'm in Texas.
[3:18:20.000 --> 3:18:21.000]  It's worse than other states.
[3:18:21.000 --> 3:18:25.000]  I mean, what's the breaking point when we all go bankrupt?
[3:18:25.000 --> 3:18:30.000]  They'll just be bureaucrats literally sticking straws in our arteries sucking our blood.
[3:18:30.000 --> 3:18:31.000]  I mean, how far does this go?
[3:18:31.000 --> 3:18:34.000]  How long until our backs break?
[3:18:34.000 --> 3:18:39.000]  Well, until the people say, I won't put up with it anymore.
[3:18:39.000 --> 3:18:40.000]  And they'll revolt.
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:42.000]  And that's why you have revolutions.
[3:18:42.000 --> 3:18:50.000]  And in most countries, people can't revolt or their chances of success are very small.
[3:18:50.000 --> 3:18:55.000]  But there's 450 million weapons in the United States.
[3:18:55.000 --> 3:18:59.000]  And there's at least 50 million people in the how to use them very, very well.
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:06.000]  And all you need is maybe four or five million people throughout the country to challenge.
[3:19:06.000 --> 3:19:07.000]  Are you kidding?
[3:19:07.000 --> 3:19:10.000]  A hundred thousand highly motivated would do.
[3:19:10.000 --> 3:19:15.000]  I mean, you know the security forces now are all about keeping themselves safe.
[3:19:15.000 --> 3:19:19.000]  They will run and hide bunkers with their tails between their legs instantly.
[3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:21.000]  It's a total paper tiger.
[3:19:21.000 --> 3:19:24.000]  I hope it doesn't come to that, but you could very well be right.
[3:19:24.000 --> 3:19:27.000]  And the people will be highly motivated.
[3:19:27.000 --> 3:19:32.000]  The problem is that the central government has said they're going to use nerve gas and just kill everybody.
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:33.000]  That's right, cops.
[3:19:33.000 --> 3:19:36.000]  If there's actually a civil war, they're going to nerve gas you with us.
[3:19:36.000 --> 3:19:40.000]  Hope you enjoy flopping around for 10 seconds while you die like a fish out of water.
[3:19:40.000 --> 3:19:42.000]  Your God is going to nerve gas you.
[3:19:42.000 --> 3:19:43.000]  Stay there.
[3:19:43.000 --> 3:19:58.000]  I want to skip the break with Bob Chapman.

[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  Trading equals permanent loss.
[3:22:16.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  Dollars fall into 65% of Euro.
[3:22:18.000 --> 3:22:19.000]  Erosion accelerates.
[3:22:19.000 --> 3:22:22.000]  Countries despise imperialistic policy of US.
[3:22:22.000 --> 3:22:24.000]  Loss of confidence causing more selling.
[3:22:24.000 --> 3:22:26.000]  GAO is warning about the debt spiraling out of control.
[3:22:26.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  Why attack Iran?
[3:22:27.000 --> 3:22:28.000]  Jerome O'Corsies.
[3:22:28.000 --> 3:22:32.000]  Iran leads attack against the US dollar document spells it out.

[3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:47.000]  It is a big idea.
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:49.000]  A new world order.
[3:22:49.000 --> 3:22:54.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:22:54.000 --> 3:22:57.000]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:22:57.000 --> 3:23:00.000]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:23:00.000 --> 3:23:03.000]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:23:03.000 --> 3:23:06.000]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order,
[3:23:06.000 --> 3:23:13.000]  their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:23:13.000 --> 3:23:15.000]  For the first time in history,
[3:23:15.000 --> 3:23:19.000]  the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[3:23:19.000 --> 3:23:23.000]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire new world order agenda.
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:25.000]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[3:23:25.000 --> 3:23:27.000]  Most people have no idea. They're not after money.
[3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:29.000]  They have all the money they need. They're after power.
[3:23:29.000 --> 3:23:31.000]  That's their aptitude.

[3:23:49.000 --> 3:23:53.000]  Okay, back to your phone calls with Bob Chapman.
[3:23:53.000 --> 3:23:56.000]  Zaina in Florida, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:24:01.000]  Yes, hello. My name is Zaina and I'm a representative of a movement that started in Georgia
[3:24:01.000 --> 3:24:05.000]  that has joined people together to forbid the wrong.
[3:24:05.000 --> 3:24:08.000]  The name of my group is Balawa Dao and G.O.I.
[3:24:08.000 --> 3:24:10.000]  Guardians of Islam.
[3:24:10.000 --> 3:24:16.000]  I found I would like to speak to you and hold a convention with you if that's possible.
[3:24:16.000 --> 3:24:20.000]  If you can take my information and give the brother a call at your earliest giving
[3:24:20.000 --> 3:24:22.000]  as that would be perfect.
[3:24:22.000 --> 3:24:25.000]  Well, let me give that to John. He'll put you on hold here in a moment.
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:28.000]  Do you have anything to say about what you've been hearing from Governor Ventura
[3:24:28.000 --> 3:24:30.000]  and Bob Chapman and others?
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:36.000]  Well, I am African-American and I have no surprise that our government has been corrupt for a long time
[3:24:36.000 --> 3:24:40.000]  but facing the current dangers of everyone that's starving and hurt,
[3:24:40.000 --> 3:24:44.000]  I think it's time for us to really start focusing on what we can do to better America.
[3:24:44.000 --> 3:24:49.000]  That's why I called so we can start introducing you to some people that I guess
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:24:53.000]  of other nationalities and around the world as Muslims.
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:56.000]  Alright, thank you. John, get her contact info.
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:25:00.000]  I'm always happy to have folks on the show. I don't know about conventions or travel.
[3:25:00.000 --> 3:25:02.000]  I'm so tied down.
[3:25:02.000 --> 3:25:06.000]  I'm going to 9-11 in New York. I'm going to Denver to cover that. May-Lay.
[3:25:06.000 --> 3:25:08.000]  And so we'll see what happens there.
[3:25:08.000 --> 3:25:10.000]  But thank you, Zana.
[3:25:10.000 --> 3:25:15.000]  Jeremy in Kentucky, you're on the air with Bob Chapman, the internationalforecaster.com.
[3:25:15.000 --> 3:25:17.000]  Hello, Alex and Mr. Chapman.
[3:25:17.000 --> 3:25:21.000]  Hey, I have a quick question and a comment if I could about Mr. Ventura after the question.
[3:25:21.000 --> 3:25:23.000]  Okay.
[3:25:23.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  I understand the economic situation we're in and I'm not trying to turn this into a spiritual question.
[3:25:28.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  I just need to kind of know the initiative here.
[3:25:31.000 --> 3:25:38.000]  You know, if you believe in God at all or if you're a Christian, you know that in the end the good always wins.
[3:25:38.000 --> 3:25:43.000]  What is their drive to do all this when they know that their master is going to lose?
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:47.000]  Well, number one, we cover the info on what you do with it as your decision.
[3:25:47.000 --> 3:25:51.000]  And I want to get Bob's response to the important question you've asked about what is their drive.
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:55.000]  There are some people who are sadistic, sociopathic.
[3:25:55.000 --> 3:25:59.000]  They tend to be sadistic psychopaths that are at the highest ranks.
[3:25:59.000 --> 3:26:01.000]  They've always got to have more.
[3:26:01.000 --> 3:26:03.000]  You know, I mean Caesar runs up to the ocean.
[3:26:03.000 --> 3:26:08.000]  He goes across and conquers, you know, Albion or England.
[3:26:08.000 --> 3:26:10.000]  They've always got to have more.
[3:26:10.000 --> 3:26:15.000]  They're hyper competitive to an insane level and they also like to be cruel.
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:17.000]  And so they don't believe in God.
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:19.000]  They don't believe in helping their species.
[3:26:19.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  They don't vote for them.
[3:26:21.000 --> 3:26:23.000]  They are cancer cells in the body politic.
[3:26:23.000 --> 3:26:25.000]  Bob Chapman.
[3:26:25.000 --> 3:26:29.000]  I cancer cells upon the entire peoples of the earth.
[3:26:29.000 --> 3:26:34.000]  And basically it's Satan versus God.
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:38.000]  And it boils just down to that, good versus evil.
[3:26:38.000 --> 3:26:42.000]  And that's why we do what we do and that's why they're doing what they're doing.
[3:26:42.000 --> 3:26:47.000]  And in the final analysis people will realize because it is going to come to that.
[3:26:47.000 --> 3:26:49.000]  And it's not too far away.
[3:26:49.000 --> 3:26:51.000]  Well, you know, people ask why I do what I do.
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:56.000]  I burn with passion and desire to warn people.
[3:26:56.000 --> 3:26:59.000]  I get mad at myself because I don't work hard enough.
[3:26:59.000 --> 3:27:01.000]  I'm not eloquent enough.
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:05.000]  I can't articulate my understanding clear enough.
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:08.000]  And I mean I burn with desire to warn people.
[3:27:08.000 --> 3:27:10.000]  I burn to reach new people.
[3:27:10.000 --> 3:27:14.000]  I burn to warn people and it's because at an instinctive level,
[3:27:14.000 --> 3:27:17.000]  spiritual, whatever you want to call it, I know what comes around goes around.
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:19.000]  And I know it at an instinctive level.
[3:27:19.000 --> 3:27:23.000]  I can intellectually reason it out and then you re-put you so as a scientific fact.
[3:27:23.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  I can intellectually in the geopolitical realm show you how it is a fact.
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:32.000]  But just instinctively, I know killing a million Iraqis in the last seven years,
[3:27:32.000 --> 3:27:37.000]  last five and a half years, killing three million of them conservatively in the last 18,
[3:27:37.000 --> 3:27:42.000]  that is a great evil done in my country's name that besmirches my forefathers
[3:27:42.000 --> 3:27:44.000]  and besmirches my children in the future.
[3:27:44.000 --> 3:27:48.000]  And that there's a law in the universe.
[3:27:48.000 --> 3:27:50.000]  We're going to be hurt because of this.
[3:27:50.000 --> 3:27:52.000]  We're going to pay for this.
[3:27:52.000 --> 3:27:55.000]  And not just when we die, folks, you pay in this life.
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:27:59.000]  And so I'm trying to rectify that, my instincts.
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:01.000]  Bob, Chabin, do you see the point I'm making?
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  Absolutely.
[3:28:03.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  And it's the same desire I have.
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:08.000]  I won't take it.
[3:28:08.000 --> 3:28:14.000]  I'm competitive enough that I must stop them from what they're doing
[3:28:14.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  because what they're doing is wrong.
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:20.000]  Yeah, there's a term, crime against humanity.
[3:28:20.000 --> 3:28:25.000]  This is a crime against our species.
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:27.000]  Does that answer your question, Jeremy?
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:29.000]  Yeah, I guess so.
[3:28:29.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  I had a quick statement about Jesse.
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:34.000]  If I could just make a statement real quick.
[3:28:34.000 --> 3:28:35.000]  I am a soldier.
[3:28:35.000 --> 3:28:37.000]  I'm not a former soldier.
[3:28:37.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  I'm actually still stationed in the United States.
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:41.000]  I'm active duty.
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:43.000]  And most soldiers are good people.
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:45.000]  They're fathers, they're sons, they're husbands.
[3:28:45.000 --> 3:28:47.000]  And I tell you what, they won't tell you.
[3:28:47.000 --> 3:28:50.000]  But we're all war out.
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:53.000]  And I've been studying all this stuff.
[3:28:53.000 --> 3:28:54.000]  I've listened to you for a year.
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:28:57.000]  I just got back from Iraq about a month ago.
[3:28:57.000 --> 3:29:00.000]  And I listened to you almost the entire time I was here over the internet.
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:03.000]  And you were my only source of entertainment.
[3:29:03.000 --> 3:29:05.000]  And I got to give it to you, Alex.
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:08.000]  You know, it takes courage to do everything that we all do together.
[3:29:08.000 --> 3:29:13.000]  I tell you what, I'm going to hold you over through this break for the prison planet.TV viewers.
[3:29:13.000 --> 3:29:14.000]  The Bob Chapman.
[3:29:14.000 --> 3:29:15.000]  Then final segment with Bob Chapman.
[3:29:15.000 --> 3:29:18.000]  Take a few more calls and then get his basic economic analysis.
[3:29:18.000 --> 3:29:20.000]  Any other key points he wants to make.
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:23.000]  I'm going to try to get him back on later in the week as this develops.
[3:29:23.000 --> 3:29:27.000]  Theinternationalforecaster.com is an invaluable source of information.
[3:29:27.000 --> 3:29:29.000]  Final segment with Bob, straight ahead.
[3:29:29.000 --> 3:29:30.000]  But Jeremy, stay there.
[3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:32.000]  We're going to let you talk to Bob behind the scenes.
[3:29:32.000 --> 3:29:34.000]  Here we go.
[3:29:34.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  We're on the march.
[3:29:36.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[3:29:38.000 --> 3:29:41.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:29:44.000 --> 3:29:47.000]  May I have everybody's attention, please?
[3:29:47.000 --> 3:29:49.000]  I've come with a message of information.
[3:29:49.000 --> 3:29:52.000]  9-11 was an inside job.
[3:29:52.000 --> 3:29:53.000]  Do you like being a puppet, sir?
[3:29:53.000 --> 3:29:55.000]  Do you like being a puppet from the New World Order?
[3:29:55.000 --> 3:29:58.000]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage?
[3:29:58.000 --> 3:30:02.000]  It was engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF.
[3:30:02.000 --> 3:30:04.000]  We sit on the shadow.
[3:30:04.000 --> 3:30:06.000]  The day that we stop asking questions
[3:30:06.000 --> 3:30:11.000]  is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[3:30:11.000 --> 3:30:14.000]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[3:30:14.000 --> 3:30:17.000]  a global awakening has taken place.
[3:30:17.000 --> 3:30:19.000]  An inside job.
[3:30:19.000 --> 3:30:21.000]  How dare you?
[3:30:21.000 --> 3:30:25.000]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[3:30:25.000 --> 3:30:27.000]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[3:30:27.000 --> 3:30:30.000]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[3:30:30.000 --> 3:30:32.000]  And if the government has not told the truth,
[3:30:32.000 --> 3:30:35.000]  in five years we will be here on the 10th anniversary of life.
[3:30:35.000 --> 3:30:36.000]  Please rise.

[3:33:12.000 --> 3:33:14.000]  You can't live in decadence forever.
[3:33:14.000 --> 3:33:16.000]  We're going into very hard times, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:33:16.000 --> 3:33:18.000]  Everybody, including people in this movement,
[3:33:18.000 --> 3:33:19.000]  need to have a gut check,
[3:33:19.000 --> 3:33:21.000]  need to put out the maximum effort right now
[3:33:21.000 --> 3:33:23.000]  against the New World Order.
[3:33:23.000 --> 3:33:25.000]  I thought Ventura would definitely run.
[3:33:25.000 --> 3:33:27.000]  It didn't sound good when he kept hinting about,
[3:33:27.000 --> 3:33:29.000]  well, don't get mad at me if I don't run.
[3:33:29.000 --> 3:33:33.000]  Alex, I'll do another interview with you before I go back to Mexico.
[3:33:33.000 --> 3:33:35.000]  If he's going to run for the Senate,
[3:33:35.000 --> 3:33:38.000]  he's not going to be going back to Mexico.
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:41.000]  We're so many people are running to,
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:33:43.000]  and we'll find out that I don't worry, King.
[3:33:43.000 --> 3:33:45.000]  Bob Chapman, we were just talking
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:46.000]  for the PrisonPlanet.tv viewers,
[3:33:46.000 --> 3:33:48.000]  because we do some of the behind-the-scenes talking,
[3:33:48.000 --> 3:33:50.000]  talking to that special forces officer
[3:33:50.000 --> 3:33:53.000]  that just came back and his commander just hung himself.
[3:33:53.000 --> 3:33:56.000]  And we have record suicides.
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:33:58.000]  In fact, I saw a report.
[3:33:58.000 --> 3:34:01.000]  It is 14 times any previous suicide numbers.
[3:34:01.000 --> 3:34:03.000]  14 times.
[3:34:03.000 --> 3:34:06.000]  I mean, they are killing themselves en masse.
[3:34:06.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  And even men, when it's a righteous war,
[3:34:08.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  tend to break down a good percentage of them,
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  or they die young on heart attacks or they're real reckless.
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:17.000]  You know, I had a lot of veterans in my family,
[3:34:17.000 --> 3:34:19.000]  and they were old guys, and you'd see them,
[3:34:19.000 --> 3:34:21.000]  they were always ready to get in a fight with somebody,
[3:34:21.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  always macho, not a fake macho, reckless, you know, crazy.
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:28.000]  And that was one tour.
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:31.000]  Imagine five tours, imagine three tours.
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  Bob, I mean, one tour would fry most people in combat.
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:37.000]  Three tours in combat.
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:41.000]  I mean, again, it's just the elites breaking all their own rules, Bob.
[3:34:41.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  They're doing things that are destroying their own power base.
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:48.000]  I think you're right about that.
[3:34:48.000 --> 3:34:50.000]  And you're also right about the tours
[3:34:50.000 --> 3:34:53.000]  and the breakdown of the individual.
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:35:02.000]  And it doesn't matter how smart or how un-smart you are.
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:04.000]  It affects everybody.
[3:35:04.000 --> 3:35:06.000]  It's an emotional thing.
[3:35:06.000 --> 3:35:10.000]  And for anybody that's ever been in combat,
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:13.000]  they know that you never want to be there again.
[3:35:13.000 --> 3:35:18.000]  And when you're asked to go three times, that's a little much.
[3:35:18.000 --> 3:35:20.000]  And so you're right, they are breaking down the structure
[3:35:20.000 --> 3:35:24.000]  that they've created this essentially mercenary force.
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  And because there's no draft involved,
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:30.000]  maybe there's a better word for it,
[3:35:30.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  but they call it a volunteer force.
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:39.000]  And that's a tough way to let make a living and make believe wars
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:42.000]  where the president has to lie to get us into a war
[3:35:42.000 --> 3:35:44.000]  to kill over a million people.
[3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:47.000]  And it's just terrible.
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:50.000]  I do a program on Friday with Drew Reigns,
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:54.000]  and most of the listeners are active and retired military people.
[3:35:54.000 --> 3:35:56.000]  And I do it because of that.
[3:35:56.000 --> 3:35:58.000]  I'm a veteran myself.
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:36:01.000]  And most of them are Reigns and Navy.
[3:36:01.000 --> 3:36:04.000]  But we get a lot of people listening from the State Department.
[3:36:04.000 --> 3:36:09.000]  And it's amazing the things that go on.
[3:36:09.000 --> 3:36:10.000]  I don't know if I ever told you,
[3:36:10.000 --> 3:36:14.000]  but they told me on the program from the State Department
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:19.000]  that all of the embassies have a copy of my report
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  every time it comes out.
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:27.000]  And Washington is very upset that I am printing what I'm printing.
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:31.000]  And so, Alex, we are getting to them, believe me.
[3:36:31.000 --> 3:36:33.000]  Oh, listen, I know.
[3:36:33.000 --> 3:36:34.000]  I found out five years ago.
[3:36:34.000 --> 3:36:39.000]  I mean, photographs that entire councils of the diet
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:43.000]  have their interns boiling down my radio shows,
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:45.000]  giving them video clips, watching my films.
[3:36:45.000 --> 3:36:49.000]  I mean, the Japanese government is...
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:51.000]  And I think of the responsibility.
[3:36:51.000 --> 3:36:53.000]  I'm just some 34-year-old guy
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:55.000]  who's been hardcore doing this for 13 years,
[3:36:55.000 --> 3:36:56.000]  studying it before that.
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:36:57.000]  And I'm a loudmouth.
[3:36:57.000 --> 3:36:59.000]  I will go off the handle the rest of it.
[3:36:59.000 --> 3:37:01.000]  But I mean, the responsibility of that.
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:03.000]  And I know, Bob, a lot of elites,
[3:37:03.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  check out what you're writing and saying.
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  When I had State Department people on me and FBI
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:11.000]  and Army intelligence on me, I'd finally say,
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:14.000]  look, I know you coming up asking me questions.
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:15.000]  I know you're with the government.
[3:37:15.000 --> 3:37:17.000]  And they'd say, well, Alex, we're just following
[3:37:17.000 --> 3:37:22.000]  to my face when nobody was around me.
[3:37:22.000 --> 3:37:25.000]  We're just doing what the Commander-in-Chief tells us.
[3:37:25.000 --> 3:37:27.000]  And I said, is there nothing you won't do?
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:29.000]  And he goes, well, look, we don't like it either.
[3:37:29.000 --> 3:37:33.000]  But I mean, I had the goons following me going,
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:34.000]  well, we don't like this either.
[3:37:34.000 --> 3:37:36.000]  And I mean, they weren't just saying that.
[3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:38.000]  They look like a pile of crap.
[3:37:38.000 --> 3:37:39.000]  I mean, you know, they look like...
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:41.000]  They felt like they were a pile of dog crap.
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:43.000]  And I hate to talk like that.
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  These were big men.
[3:37:44.000 --> 3:37:46.000]  But they know they're bad.
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:47.000]  They know they're working for the bad side.
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:49.000]  They know, don't they, Bob?
[3:37:49.000 --> 3:37:51.000]  They certainly do.
[3:37:51.000 --> 3:37:52.000]  They certainly do.
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:55.000]  And when they can stop people like you and I,
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:57.000]  or even get us incarcerated, they think,
[3:37:57.000 --> 3:38:00.000]  oh, maybe I'll get a promotion.
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:02.000]  I mean, that's what their mindset is.
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  Now, I want to tell them something.
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:05.000]  All you're going to get is bad luck.
[3:38:05.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  And that isn't some physical threat.
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  You are foolish if you don't know that when you do bad things,
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:13.000]  and that means especially messing with somebody
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:14.000]  who's putting the truth out,
[3:38:14.000 --> 3:38:17.000]  that the universe doesn't like that, do they, Bob?
[3:38:17.000 --> 3:38:19.000]  They certainly don't.
[3:38:19.000 --> 3:38:20.000]  And they got to pay.
[3:38:20.000 --> 3:38:22.000]  And how that'll happen, I don't know.
[3:38:22.000 --> 3:38:27.000]  And, you know, it's really not my place to make sure
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:30.000]  that they get payback for what they're doing.
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  There's other forces that will take care of that.
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:33.000]  That's right.
[3:38:33.000 --> 3:38:34.000]  That's how it works.
[3:38:34.000 --> 3:38:35.000]  A few final calls.
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:37.000]  Let's talk to Chris and Montreal, Canada,
[3:38:37.000 --> 3:38:38.000]  then Tony and Peggy.
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:39.000]  Go ahead, Chris.
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:40.000]  You're on the air with Bob Jamin.
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:41.000]  Hey, Alex.
[3:38:41.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  Hey, Bob.
[3:38:42.000 --> 3:38:43.000]  Good afternoon.
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:46.000]  First, it's just a couple of comments.
[3:38:46.000 --> 3:38:50.000]  Two off topic. First, I'd like to say that truth rising is excellent.
[3:38:50.000 --> 3:38:51.000]  It's excellent.
[3:38:51.000 --> 3:38:55.000]  The cinematography, the score, it's a beautiful, beautiful movie.
[3:38:55.000 --> 3:39:00.000]  But my question was about legal militias.
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:01.000]  Do they still exist?
[3:39:01.000 --> 3:39:03.000]  I know that in the States and in Canada,
[3:39:03.000 --> 3:39:07.000]  a lot of the militias have been absorbed either into the National Guard
[3:39:07.000 --> 3:39:09.000]  or in Canada, the reserves.
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:12.000]  But I'm not really 100% clear on it.
[3:39:12.000 --> 3:39:14.000]  Yeah, that's the organized...
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:16.000]  Okay, well, let me tell you real fast.
[3:39:16.000 --> 3:39:19.000]  The organized militia wasn't set up until 1906
[3:39:19.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  as the National Guards.
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  All the Federalist Papers, all the court cases,
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  I mean, that's why a sheriff could deputize...
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:30.000]  You had to do what he said.
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:33.000]  That was an instant draft by the elected representative.
[3:39:33.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  Could say, you're coming with me.
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:36.000]  Somebody just killed some kid.
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:37.000]  Just raped some girl.
[3:39:37.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  We're going to chase them if it's across five states.
[3:39:40.000 --> 3:39:41.000]  There was no jurisdiction.
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:42.000]  They went after them.
[3:39:42.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  So that's when the people were the government.
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:47.000]  Now there's the mistrust of the corrupt government of the people.
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:50.000]  So militias are totally legal, totally lawful.
[3:39:50.000 --> 3:39:53.000]  It is your right in duty, 18 to 49,
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  and in enduring emergencies, they can call people out even 65.
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:40:01.000]  The governor, the county commissioners, the sheriff.
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:03.000]  The city cannot call out the militia.
[3:40:03.000 --> 3:40:07.000]  It's a state function and through state chartered institutions.
[3:40:07.000 --> 3:40:09.000]  But the problem is they infiltrate militias
[3:40:09.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  when people try to set them up
[3:40:11.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  and then feds even try to become leaders
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:15.000]  to then send everybody to prison,
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:17.000]  plant pipe bombs on their property,
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:20.000]  to then scare anybody from forming militias.
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:21.000]  But we're all militias.
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:24.000]  A man owning a firearm is a militia.
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:26.000]  You want to explain this to him, Bob?
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:29.000]  No, I think you've covered it fully.
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:31.000]  That's just the way it is.
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:33.000]  And the government has done that.
[3:40:33.000 --> 3:40:36.000]  And they've tried to do that to me several times.
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:39.000]  In fact, they've gone to friends of mine and told them
[3:40:39.000 --> 3:40:41.000]  they want them to give all the information
[3:40:41.000 --> 3:40:43.000]  they can and spy upon me.
[3:40:43.000 --> 3:40:45.000]  And I didn't know it until years later
[3:40:45.000 --> 3:40:47.000]  because he didn't do that.
[3:40:47.000 --> 3:40:49.000]  And before he died, he told me
[3:40:49.000 --> 3:40:52.000]  that they had come and threatened them and so on and so forth.
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:56.000]  And so they do do those things.
[3:40:56.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  Well, yeah, I'm fully aware of the undermining
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  of any effort like this.
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:04.000]  Yeah, and like I said, I was just wondering if,
[3:41:04.000 --> 3:41:06.000]  I mean, I know they're legal,
[3:41:06.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  but they've been demonized and...
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:10.000]  Yeah, but see, the Second Amendment is...
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:12.000]  Montana militia is renowned for being these cooks,
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:14.000]  but I know what a militia is.
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  I know they're not nuts.
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:19.000]  And I was just wondering why this isn't happening more en masse.
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:22.000]  Like, you would think that as many organized militias
[3:41:22.000 --> 3:41:26.000]  as you can in as many places would be very...
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:29.000]  Chris, let me move on and explain what happened.
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:34.000]  The militia movement had state representatives behind it.
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:37.000]  Oklahoma passed an anti-UN law
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:38.000]  and called out the militia.
[3:41:38.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  And the feds went in there and blew a federal building
[3:41:40.000 --> 3:41:43.000]  to Kingdom Come to blame it on the militia.
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:45.000]  People would try to form militias
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:47.000]  and then feds would infiltrate and provocateur.
[3:41:47.000 --> 3:41:51.000]  I mean, I've gone out to pro-Second Amendment meetings
[3:41:51.000 --> 3:41:53.000]  that the government here considers a militia
[3:41:53.000 --> 3:41:55.000]  and we had feds come to it and locals and say,
[3:41:55.000 --> 3:41:57.000]  let's blow things up and kill police.
[3:41:57.000 --> 3:41:59.000]  And then we'd follow them out in the parking lot
[3:41:59.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  and they thought we were so dumb,
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  they were driving unmarked police cars
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  and then we'd follow the cop home and he'd say,
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:07.000]  leave me alone, okay, I was just spying on you.
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:09.000]  They spy on anti-war groups.
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:11.000]  They're criminal dirtbags.
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:15.000]  And so, you know, the point is, is that
[3:42:15.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  when they attack your Second Amendment right,
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:20.000]  that's an attack on the militia, okay?
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:22.000]  The militia is you being armed
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:24.000]  and having a few of your friends you've known
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  for your lifetime saying,
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:27.000]  we're not going to a FEMA camp
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  and if anybody tries to take us and our family,
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:30.000]  we're going to stick together.
[3:42:30.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  That's a militia, okay?
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:34.000]  Bob, do you agree with that?
[3:42:34.000 --> 3:42:35.000]  Absolutely.
[3:42:35.000 --> 3:42:38.000]  Yeah, I mean, folks, let me tell you what's valuable.
[3:42:38.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  Scorable foods, water filters, skills, firearms,
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  the willingness to defend yourself.
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:47.000]  Okay, and of enough of us just, it's like porcupines.
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:48.000]  Wolves leave them alone.
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:49.000]  We're not looking for trouble.
[3:42:49.000 --> 3:42:51.000]  I mean, I think our flag ought to be a porcupine.
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  We just, we're like, do not mess with us.
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:56.000]  Just, you know, leave us alone
[3:42:56.000 --> 3:42:58.000]  and we're purely defensive,
[3:42:58.000 --> 3:43:01.000]  but I don't like shooting my mouth off.
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:04.000]  The point is, is if they try to put you in labor camps,
[3:43:04.000 --> 3:43:05.000]  take your kids,
[3:43:05.000 --> 3:43:07.000]  you don't have a choice at that point, folks.
[3:43:07.000 --> 3:43:08.000]  Bob?
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:10.000]  I agree completely.
[3:43:10.000 --> 3:43:12.000]  Absolutely.
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:14.000]  And I preach it on the air all the time
[3:43:14.000 --> 3:43:17.000]  and I wanted a few newsletters
[3:43:17.000 --> 3:43:20.000]  and a year of personality on radio
[3:43:20.000 --> 3:43:22.000]  that come out and say such things.
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:25.000]  There's only a handful of people that got the guts to do it.
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:27.000]  Well, I mean, it's real simple.
[3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:29.000]  It is a moral right and a duty
[3:43:29.000 --> 3:43:32.000]  if they try to take you and your families to camps
[3:43:32.000 --> 3:43:34.000]  to resist that with lethal force.
[3:43:34.000 --> 3:43:37.000]  And all the federal rulings say that.
[3:43:37.000 --> 3:43:39.000]  When the government is engaging in crime,
[3:43:39.000 --> 3:43:41.000]  I don't care if they say crime's legal.
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:43.000]  You have a right and duty to protect yourself.
[3:43:43.000 --> 3:43:46.000]  And I don't know how they've drummed the instincts
[3:43:46.000 --> 3:43:47.000]  out of so many men and women
[3:43:47.000 --> 3:43:49.000]  to let them take your children and the rest of it.
[3:43:49.000 --> 3:43:52.000]  We, I mean, when you lay down like cowards, folks,
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:53.000]  they win, okay?
[3:43:53.000 --> 3:43:55.000]  We don't have a choice.
[3:43:55.000 --> 3:43:56.000]  And quit pushing.
[3:43:56.000 --> 3:43:59.000]  I mean, I'm just telling people in government,
[3:43:59.000 --> 3:44:00.000]  you're in the wrong.
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:01.000]  You're not God.
[3:44:01.000 --> 3:44:04.000]  And, and, and, and, and, oh my God.
[3:44:04.000 --> 3:44:06.000]  There is consequences.
[3:44:06.000 --> 3:44:08.000]  Now there are consequences, folks.
[3:44:08.000 --> 3:44:09.000]  I'm not happy about this.
[3:44:09.000 --> 3:44:10.000]  I'm not.
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:11.000]  This is the real world.
[3:44:11.000 --> 3:44:14.000]  Peggy and P.A. and then Arian, Arian in the Netherlands.
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:15.000]  Go ahead, Peggy.
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:17.000]  No, Tony in Australia.
[3:44:17.000 --> 3:44:18.000]  We got to move fast.
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:19.000]  Tony in Australia.
[3:44:19.000 --> 3:44:21.000]  Go ahead.
[3:44:21.000 --> 3:44:22.000]  You there?
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:23.000]  Yes, I am.
[3:44:23.000 --> 3:44:25.000]  Go ahead.
[3:44:25.000 --> 3:44:26.000]  Yeah.
[3:44:26.000 --> 3:44:29.000]  I just, I wanted to ring and say that I thought it was important
[3:44:29.000 --> 3:44:32.000]  for Governor Ventura to get into politics.
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:35.000]  You need a bit of sanity in government over there.
[3:44:35.000 --> 3:44:39.000]  And I think you'd be just perfect for the job.
[3:44:39.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  A few things I wanted to mention.
[3:44:42.000 --> 3:44:47.000]  You, you keep on predicting what will happen in America.
[3:44:47.000 --> 3:44:50.000]  They're already happening here.
[3:44:50.000 --> 3:44:52.000]  They mean to test pensions.
[3:44:52.000 --> 3:44:53.000]  If you've saved up a little money,
[3:44:53.000 --> 3:44:57.000]  you either don't get the pension or they reduce it.
[3:44:57.000 --> 3:45:01.000]  They're using the military to police Aboriginal,
[3:45:01.000 --> 3:45:05.000]  Aboriginal settlements in the, in the outback.
[3:45:05.000 --> 3:45:11.000]  And they're going to bring in carbon trading in 2010
[3:45:11.000 --> 3:45:17.000]  with not very adequate explanation.
[3:45:17.000 --> 3:45:20.000]  Illegal aliens are put into detention camps in the outback.
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:23.000]  They can get adequate medical attention for their children.
[3:45:23.000 --> 3:45:26.000]  And the list just goes on and on and on.
[3:45:26.000 --> 3:45:29.000]  So what you're predicting is already happening.
[3:45:29.000 --> 3:45:30.000]  That's right.
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:33.000]  The Australian government, there was a real crocodile Dundee.
[3:45:33.000 --> 3:45:35.000]  He looked just like the guy in the movie.
[3:45:35.000 --> 3:45:37.000]  And what was it in 1998?
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:38.000]  He wouldn't turn his guns in.
[3:45:38.000 --> 3:45:41.000]  They came out to his house and murdered him.
[3:45:41.000 --> 3:45:44.000]  Well, I would believe it.
[3:45:44.000 --> 3:45:45.000]  Yeah.
[3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:47.000]  They've almost completely disarmed you guys out there
[3:45:47.000 --> 3:45:50.000]  and they're CPSing your children for no reason.
[3:45:50.000 --> 3:45:51.000]  Yeah.
[3:45:51.000 --> 3:45:54.000]  I'm fully aware Australia is really bad now.
[3:45:54.000 --> 3:45:55.000]  Yeah.
[3:45:55.000 --> 3:45:56.000]  Yeah.
[3:45:56.000 --> 3:45:58.000]  And the pope is visiting this week
[3:45:58.000 --> 3:46:01.000]  and especially introduced martial law in Sydney
[3:46:01.000 --> 3:46:04.000]  to control the population.
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:06.000]  You're not allowed to wear certain t-shirts
[3:46:06.000 --> 3:46:08.000]  and catch it upsets people.
[3:46:08.000 --> 3:46:09.000]  That type of thing.
[3:46:09.000 --> 3:46:10.000]  Yeah.
[3:46:10.000 --> 3:46:12.000]  They're getting used to no free speech, no nothing.
[3:46:12.000 --> 3:46:13.000]  Yeah.
[3:46:13.000 --> 3:46:14.000]  Yeah.
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:17.000]  But what I think is happening is that they got all the procedures
[3:46:17.000 --> 3:46:19.000]  now in place.
[3:46:19.000 --> 3:46:22.000]  And what people don't realize is if they can use a military
[3:46:22.000 --> 3:46:25.000]  to control aboriginal settlements,
[3:46:25.000 --> 3:46:27.000]  if they can put illegal aliens in detention camps
[3:46:27.000 --> 3:46:32.000]  and not provide adequate medical attention for the children,
[3:46:32.000 --> 3:46:34.000]  they can do it to anybody.
[3:46:34.000 --> 3:46:35.000]  No, no.
[3:46:35.000 --> 3:46:36.000]  That's absolutely right, sir.
[3:46:36.000 --> 3:46:37.000]  And call me back again.
[3:46:37.000 --> 3:46:38.000]  I want to hear more from you.
[3:46:38.000 --> 3:46:39.000]  We've got to go because Bob's got to go.
[3:46:39.000 --> 3:46:41.000]  And just a moment, I've got some final news.
[3:46:41.000 --> 3:46:43.000]  It's very important I want to cover.
[3:46:43.000 --> 3:46:45.000]  Bob, I mean, he said it all right there.
[3:46:45.000 --> 3:46:46.000]  And he's right.
[3:46:46.000 --> 3:46:49.000]  In England, in Australia, it is classical tyranny now
[3:46:49.000 --> 3:46:52.000]  where they're even arresting mainstream reporters now.
[3:46:52.000 --> 3:46:54.000]  I mean, it's getting bad.
[3:46:54.000 --> 3:46:59.000]  Yeah, and you can't even take your children to school
[3:46:59.000 --> 3:47:03.000]  unless you've been cleared and has proven you're not a criminal.
[3:47:03.000 --> 3:47:06.000]  And very often they will assign a criminal background
[3:47:06.000 --> 3:47:08.000]  to somebody who's not criminal.
[3:47:08.000 --> 3:47:10.000]  And then you have to go fight them to prove
[3:47:10.000 --> 3:47:12.000]  that you are not a criminal.
[3:47:12.000 --> 3:47:13.000]  It's unbelievable.
[3:47:13.000 --> 3:47:15.000]  Folks, the government went rogue.
[3:47:15.000 --> 3:47:17.000]  That happens nine times out of ten.
[3:47:17.000 --> 3:47:18.000]  It happened here.
[3:47:18.000 --> 3:47:21.000]  Folks, you can't screw around anymore.
[3:47:21.000 --> 3:47:22.000]  They've built camps.
[3:47:22.000 --> 3:47:25.000]  They've got people working for them.
[3:47:25.000 --> 3:47:28.000]  Every criminal, they're openly hiring felons.
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:31.000]  Sheriff's departments all over the U.S. are hiring felons.
[3:47:31.000 --> 3:47:32.000]  Not just the military now.
[3:47:32.000 --> 3:47:35.000]  I mean, the government's criminal.
[3:47:35.000 --> 3:47:36.000]  End of story.
[3:47:36.000 --> 3:47:38.000]  Two final calls real fast.
[3:47:38.000 --> 3:47:40.000]  Let's go to Arianne, Arianne in the Netherlands.
[3:47:40.000 --> 3:47:43.000]  I want to go to them first. Go ahead, Arianne.
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:44.000]  Hi, Alex.
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:47.000]  This is Arianne Blau calling from the Netherlands.
[3:47:47.000 --> 3:47:48.000]  Can you hear me?
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:49.000]  Yes, sir.
[3:47:49.000 --> 3:47:50.000]  Okay.
[3:47:50.000 --> 3:47:53.000]  I would like to thank you for all those years.
[3:47:53.000 --> 3:47:55.000]  I've been listening for more than seven years now,
[3:47:55.000 --> 3:47:57.000]  dating the pre-911 area.
[3:47:57.000 --> 3:48:01.000]  I was amazed when you were doing the prediction
[3:48:01.000 --> 3:48:04.000]  in June of that year.
[3:48:04.000 --> 3:48:08.000]  I want to just move on quickly towards the emergency food
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:10.000]  here in Holland.
[3:48:10.000 --> 3:48:12.000]  The New World Order has taken over.
[3:48:12.000 --> 3:48:13.000]  All but taken over.
[3:48:13.000 --> 3:48:18.000]  It's a lot of stuff that is being placed on the Internet.
[3:48:18.000 --> 3:48:21.000]  People are no longer free.
[3:48:21.000 --> 3:48:24.000]  There's so much stuff that is happening right now.
[3:48:24.000 --> 3:48:27.000]  People are just sleeping while they should be preparing.
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:32.000]  Last week, I just ordered a large stack of food
[3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:35.000]  at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:48:35.000 --> 3:48:40.000]  I've been busy from 2004 to prepare a big retreat
[3:48:40.000 --> 3:48:44.000]  for people to go away from Europe into South Africa
[3:48:44.000 --> 3:48:46.000]  to live off the grid over there.
[3:48:46.000 --> 3:48:50.000]  It's something that we've been working on for years and years.
[3:48:50.000 --> 3:48:54.000]  Finally, it seems to give off some fruit.
[3:48:54.000 --> 3:48:58.000]  I believe that Iran is going to be bombed.
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:48:59.000]  I've got some information.
[3:48:59.000 --> 3:49:05.000]  Bob is not sure I understand.
[3:49:05.000 --> 3:49:06.000]  I respect you very much.
[3:49:06.000 --> 3:49:11.000]  Your analysis, I respected awfully a lot.
[3:49:11.000 --> 3:49:16.000]  I do see in Daniel A. that first Iraq was going to be bombed,
[3:49:16.000 --> 3:49:18.000]  and later on Iran will be bombed,
[3:49:18.000 --> 3:49:21.000]  and Israel will take much of the brunt of that attack
[3:49:21.000 --> 3:49:23.000]  that has yet to come.
[3:49:23.000 --> 3:49:24.000]  I know this.
[3:49:24.000 --> 3:49:26.000]  All the rich billionaire Jews are leaving.
[3:49:26.000 --> 3:49:27.000]  Call me back tomorrow.
[3:49:27.000 --> 3:49:28.000]  The show is almost over.
[3:49:28.000 --> 3:49:29.000]  We're going to end it right there.
[3:49:29.000 --> 3:49:31.000]  We'll get to Peggy in the final segment that we have time.
[3:49:31.000 --> 3:49:33.000]  Sorry, Peggy can't talk to Bob Chapman.
[3:49:33.000 --> 3:49:37.000]  I wanted to plug theinternationalforecaster.com.
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:39.000]  People want to get a free hard copy of it.
[3:49:39.000 --> 3:49:42.000]  What number do they call to get a sample copy, Bob?
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:47.000]  800-375-4188.
[3:49:47.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  800-375-4188.
[3:49:51.000 --> 3:49:53.000]  Or they can go to the site,
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:57.000]  theinternationalforecaster.com.
[3:49:57.000 --> 3:49:59.000]  Bob, I tell you what, you've got about three more minutes.
[3:49:59.000 --> 3:50:02.000]  Let me hold you through, I mean, into this behind-the-scenes break,
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:05.000]  but at least folks watching on the web and on TV,
[3:50:05.000 --> 3:50:07.000]  at prisonplanet.tv, can hear me go to Peggy.
[3:50:07.000 --> 3:50:09.000]  We're going to come back in the final segment with a recap
[3:50:09.000 --> 3:50:11.000]  of some newly developed financial news.
[3:50:11.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  The banks, the Private Federal Reserve, dumping our tax money in,
[3:50:15.000 --> 3:50:18.000]  you're going to fit the bill, can't even prop the stock market up.
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:21.000]  I want to get Bob's take on that and then talk to Peggy
[3:50:21.000 --> 3:50:24.000]  for three more minutes, then we'll come back in the final segment.
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:27.000]  Right here on the one, the only GCN radio network.
[3:50:27.000 --> 3:50:30.000]  Don't forget, we've redesigned prisonplanet.com.
[3:50:30.000 --> 3:50:33.000]  How do we get more people to tune in and find out the truth?
[3:50:33.000 --> 3:50:35.000]  I'm not risking my life or nothing here.
[3:50:35.000 --> 3:50:37.000]  You tell them. How to listen on the web,
[3:50:37.000 --> 3:50:41.000]  shortwave and AM and FM, infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[3:50:41.000 --> 3:50:42.000]  We'll be right back.
[3:50:47.000 --> 3:50:49.000]  Once America was led by real politicians,
[3:50:49.000 --> 3:50:52.000]  now politicians in the U.S., city, county, state and federal
[3:50:52.000 --> 3:50:54.000]  are owned and controlled by corporations.
[3:50:54.000 --> 3:50:57.000]  We have corporate representatives instead of politicians.
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:50:59.000]  Criminal corporate manipulation has caused green prices
[3:50:59.000 --> 3:51:01.000]  to soar to the highest levels in history.
[3:51:01.000 --> 3:51:04.000]  Shortages of rice, corn and wheat now exist in most countries.
[3:51:04.000 --> 3:51:07.000]  Natural disasters have put millions worldwide at risk of starvation.
[3:51:07.000 --> 3:51:10.000]  Food riots and bread lines occur daily in 30 nations
[3:51:10.000 --> 3:51:13.000]  and not only is that list growing, but it's headed this way.
[3:51:13.000 --> 3:51:15.000]  Survival enterprises are massive distributors
[3:51:15.000 --> 3:51:17.000]  of the highest quality long-term storage foods.
[3:51:17.000 --> 3:51:22.000]  Mountain House freeze-dried foods, canned beef, chicken, turkey, butter, bacon, spices, cheese, fruit and more.
[3:51:22.000 --> 3:51:24.000]  We have tons of food in stock now.

[3:51:41.000 --> 3:51:44.000]  Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[3:51:44.000 --> 3:51:46.000]  Loose change, final cut.
[3:51:46.000 --> 3:51:48.000]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[3:51:48.000 --> 3:51:50.000]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[3:51:50.000 --> 3:51:51.000]  The late-rate USA.
[3:51:51.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  America, freedom to fascism.
[3:51:53.000 --> 3:51:57.000]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available

[3:53:50.000 --> 3:53:53.000]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:53:56.000 --> 3:53:58.000]  Alright, final segment.
[3:53:58.000 --> 3:54:02.000]  Folks, retransmission starts with Jesse Ventura for more than an hour.
[3:54:02.000 --> 3:54:06.000]  Key economic analysis where I cover the news in the first hour
[3:54:06.000 --> 3:54:11.000]  and what we're facing starts on the web only at infowars.com.
[3:54:11.000 --> 3:54:16.000]  The next few hours for prisonplanet.tv members will have the Jesse Ventura video hosted.
[3:54:16.000 --> 3:54:18.000]  I want to spend four minutes with Ted Anderson.
[3:54:18.000 --> 3:54:21.000]  I had him on for about five minutes in the first hour, too.
[3:54:21.000 --> 3:54:26.000]  Ted is selling gold and silver that he bought, that he locked in this morning
[3:54:26.000 --> 3:54:29.000]  before it went up by 15-plus dollars.
[3:54:29.000 --> 3:54:32.000]  Gold and silver.
[3:54:32.000 --> 3:54:34.000]  Ted literally makes no money on this.
[3:54:34.000 --> 3:54:37.000]  He pays the brokers like 2% to take the order.
[3:54:37.000 --> 3:54:41.000]  Ted's doing this to introduce you to metals, physically holding them.
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:43.000]  It's because you're my listeners.
[3:54:43.000 --> 3:54:48.000]  You're going to pay 9.70 something if you buy gold anywhere right now,
[3:54:48.000 --> 3:54:51.000]  but Ted has it locked in and it's somewhat numismatic.
[3:54:51.000 --> 3:54:53.000]  It has collector value.
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:54:59.000]  He's offering British sovereigns, European francs, Swiss and French francs,
[3:54:59.000 --> 3:55:03.000]  and the American silver dollars at, I don't know,
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  each one of the coins he was selling, the silver dollars were at $1 or about 90 cents above spot.
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:11.000]  You can't get them at that.
[3:55:11.000 --> 3:55:13.000]  And that was at the cost this morning when he locked them in.
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:14.000]  They're below spot.
[3:55:14.000 --> 3:55:16.000]  The silver is an insane deal.
[3:55:16.000 --> 3:55:18.000]  And I feel good supporting the network,
[3:55:18.000 --> 3:55:21.000]  but mainly supporting you folks when you hurt the New World Order
[3:55:21.000 --> 3:55:23.000]  and transfer some of your federal reserve notes,
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:25.000]  because you can pull your federal reserve notes out of the bank.
[3:55:25.000 --> 3:55:29.000]  They're just going to devalue there too.
[3:55:29.000 --> 3:55:31.000]  It's an amazing feeling.
[3:55:31.000 --> 3:55:35.000]  The little bit of capital we've got is there to fund the operation.
[3:55:35.000 --> 3:55:37.000]  That's why I'm rushing to get the cameras,
[3:55:37.000 --> 3:55:41.000]  build the stage for the TV show to spend the money we got from the money bomb
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:44.000]  before it's devalued the next year and a half.
[3:55:44.000 --> 3:55:46.000]  You know, we are just last ditch.
[3:55:46.000 --> 3:55:49.000]  We're not running off with our little nest egg.
[3:55:49.000 --> 3:55:51.000]  We're just spending it to fight the New World Order.
[3:55:51.000 --> 3:55:54.000]  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't protect your nest egg.
[3:55:54.000 --> 3:55:57.000]  Ted, I mean, we've seen the markets go crazy today.
[3:55:57.000 --> 3:55:59.000]  They pumped billions into the stock market.
[3:55:59.000 --> 3:56:01.000]  It still went down.
[3:56:01.000 --> 3:56:03.000]  This is getting scarier and scarier, Ted.
[3:56:03.000 --> 3:56:04.000]  Oh, it sure is.
[3:56:04.000 --> 3:56:07.000]  It's amazing to see what happened to those bank stocks today.
[3:56:07.000 --> 3:56:09.000]  I mean, it just dropped like a stone.
[3:56:09.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  And we're talking about major bank slates.
[3:56:11.000 --> 3:56:13.000]  Yeah, tell folks real fast what happened.
[3:56:13.000 --> 3:56:17.000]  Yeah, well, you'd have to just look at the indexes and look at it.
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:19.000]  I'm going to take a couple of examples here.
[3:56:19.000 --> 3:56:21.000]  If you just look at some of the major bank,
[3:56:21.000 --> 3:56:26.000]  Citicorp, Zion, Washington Mutual, all that stuff just fell to the floor.
[3:56:26.000 --> 3:56:32.000]  Of course, Indy Mac went down from about $30 a share, almost to zero now.
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:36.000]  And the markets just get beat up like crazy gold and silver both up,
[3:56:36.000 --> 3:56:41.000]  $9.76 gold and silver $9.26.
[3:56:41.000 --> 3:56:43.000]  A tremendous increase today in that market.
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:45.000]  I'm real surprised to see that happen this time of the year.
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:49.000]  For those that don't know, headline, Fed's spell out Freddie Mac a plan,
[3:56:49.000 --> 3:56:53.000]  which bank will fail next, borrowers line up in California
[3:56:53.000 --> 3:56:55.000]  will withdraw their cash from Citigroup,
[3:56:55.000 --> 3:57:00.000]  $1.1 trillion of mysterious assets, shadows, earnings.
[3:57:00.000 --> 3:57:01.000]  I mean, it's meltdown.
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:05.000]  I'm praying everybody's right and we got a year or two before the depression hits.
[3:57:05.000 --> 3:57:08.000]  I mean, it's not a question of if, but when now, Ted,
[3:57:08.000 --> 3:57:11.000]  how do folks call and get gold and silver at insane prices?
[3:57:11.000 --> 3:57:15.000]  Well, right now, 1-800-686-2237.
[3:57:15.000 --> 3:57:19.000]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:23.000]  We have the frank coins, like you mentioned, they're at 212.
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:28.000]  We also have the sovereign coins too, another great buy.
[3:57:28.000 --> 3:57:35.000]  They're at 286 and those rolls of silver coins, like you said, right now at 202 per roll of 20,
[3:57:35.000 --> 3:57:37.000]  that is just insane.
[3:57:37.000 --> 3:57:42.000]  And again, very short time ago, Alex, silver wasn't even available on the marketplace.
[3:57:42.000 --> 3:57:43.000]  I couldn't sell them.
[3:57:43.000 --> 3:57:47.000]  So call 800-686-2237 and take advantage of this.
[3:57:47.000 --> 3:57:50.000]  You need to take a look at what's happening in that banking industry.
[3:57:50.000 --> 3:57:52.000]  It's not to frighten anybody.
[3:57:52.000 --> 3:57:55.000]  Yeah, this is just bracing for impact here, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:57:55.000 --> 3:57:57.000]  and it's only going to get worse.
[3:57:57.000 --> 3:58:01.000]  Politicians are telling you everything's wonderful as everything goes to hell in a handbasket.
[3:58:01.000 --> 3:58:04.000]  Meanwhile, Dick Cheney two years ago sold all his dollars for Euros
[3:58:04.000 --> 3:58:08.000]  and bought a house in Dubai, Bush is moving to Paraglabe.
[3:58:08.000 --> 3:58:11.000]  Carl Rove left the country last week under subpoena
[3:58:11.000 --> 3:58:15.000]  and is now under indictment 1-800-686-2237.
[3:58:15.000 --> 3:58:16.000]  Thanks, Ted.
[3:58:16.000 --> 3:58:17.000]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[3:58:17.000 --> 3:58:21.000]  Retransmission starts now at the one the only, infowars.com.
[3:58:21.000 --> 3:58:35.000]  You are listening to GCN. Visit GCNLive.com today.
[3:58:35.000 --> 3:58:40.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops,
[3:58:40.000 --> 3:58:44.000]  I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[3:58:44.000 --> 3:58:51.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:58:51.000 --> 3:59:00.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:59:00.000 --> 3:59:03.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth
[3:59:03.000 --> 3:59:07.000]  as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:59:07.000 --> 3:59:10.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:59:10.000 --> 3:59:16.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:59:16.000 --> 3:59:19.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[3:59:19.000 --> 3:59:25.000]  Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[3:59:25.000 --> 3:59:28.000]  Or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[3:59:28.000 --> 3:59:30.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror,
[3:59:30.000 --> 3:59:34.000]  they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:59:34.000 --> 3:59:41.000]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
