[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:20.800]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.800 --> 00:30.400]  today is the 14th day of October 2009 and just in case you don't know my voice I am
[00:30.400 --> 00:37.000]  not Alex Jones I am Ted Anderson I own the Genesis Communications Network I also own
[00:37.000 --> 00:40.880]  Midas Resources Incorporated Alex called me this morning I had the pleasure of
[00:40.880 --> 00:45.480]  getting a call directly from Alex Jones in California who happens to be shooting
[00:45.480 --> 00:50.000]  a film with Jesse Ventura could you imagine being in that position well here
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.920]  I am and I just want to tell you that Alex Jones is out there fighting the
[00:53.920 --> 00:57.240]  battle and while he is doing that he asked me to give you a quick call
[00:57.240 --> 01:01.200]  because he knows that gold is going crazy and he wants me to give you a quick
[01:01.200 --> 01:06.880]  update gold right now is seeing a low today of 1057 20 and a high today of
[01:06.880 --> 01:14.040]  1066 10 currently the last time I had looked at gold it was at 1062 and 60
[01:14.040 --> 01:18.320]  cents you know I often I got I have people coming to me wondering if they
[01:18.320 --> 01:22.160]  should be selling their position in gold at this point and they say that it's
[01:22.160 --> 01:26.280]  gone up so much in value and they always look at me with gold with these
[01:26.280 --> 01:31.840]  doe eyes when I say gold is an increased in value at all and they look at me and
[01:31.840 --> 01:36.240]  they wonder if I've gone crazy and despite the fact that I have gold has
[01:36.240 --> 01:41.160]  not increased in value the dollar this Federal Reserve note that we use here as
[01:41.160 --> 01:46.160]  money in the United States of America has gone down and is going down again
[01:46.160 --> 01:53.680]  today right now the dollar quoted at $75 and 63 cents down 18 cents at this
[01:53.680 --> 01:58.880]  particular moment and just that is just another indicator of what's going on in
[01:58.880 --> 02:03.480]  the marketplace in case those of you who sleep through the night and don't watch
[02:03.480 --> 02:08.320]  the Asian markets like I do would know at this point in time that gold is
[02:08.320 --> 02:14.800]  already shot up over $1,070 an ounce it happens in Asia and here in the United
[02:14.800 --> 02:19.160]  States where the manipulation is in favor of the US dollar and the banking
[02:19.160 --> 02:25.200]  system that is currently under control so to speak does like to push the US the
[02:25.200 --> 02:30.120]  US dollar up and suppress the price of gold and that's why we see here in the
[02:30.120 --> 02:34.000]  United States when the New York market opens up we have a tendency to see
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.920]  lower prices I guess that's a advantage to us I wish that give us lower prices
[02:38.920 --> 02:42.200]  because it would give us a better opportunity to get out of their stink
[02:42.200 --> 02:47.120]  and fiat currency nonetheless one way or the other however you want to put it the
[02:47.120 --> 02:50.840]  United States currency is on a downward slide and I don't think that trend is
[02:50.840 --> 02:54.260]  going to stop and I think it'd be foolish to sell your gold and silver and
[02:54.260 --> 02:59.120]  trade it back to Federal Reserve notes or anything that related to those that
[02:59.120 --> 03:04.840]  would be including stocks bonds CDs bank deposits annuities you name it I don't
[03:04.840 --> 03:08.360]  think that there's anything that's safe out there other than precious metals the
[03:08.360 --> 03:13.000]  real estate market has proven that to be true anything that's being priced based
[03:13.000 --> 03:17.760]  upon leverage I would just get away from it the United States has a has a
[03:17.760 --> 03:22.800]  tendency to spend more than they can afford and that's one of the reasons
[03:22.800 --> 03:26.760]  why we're seeing a continuous loss in the dollar why the Asian markets being
[03:26.760 --> 03:31.720]  strong well guess what the Chinese are right you know is right in that market
[03:31.720 --> 03:37.240]  the Asian markets have a tendency to rise more than the US markets and that's
[03:37.240 --> 03:40.440]  because the Chinese are sitting on about three point three trillion dollars a US
[03:40.440 --> 03:44.800]  government securities and they sell those US government securities which they
[03:44.800 --> 03:48.280]  continue to threaten to do the United States dollar is going to lose
[03:48.280 --> 03:52.320]  purchasing power here at home for us we're going to be paying more for what
[03:52.320 --> 03:57.920]  we need to buy it's going to be like Argentina Brazil and Mexico and a long
[03:57.920 --> 04:02.200]  list of countries that have thought that they could spend their way out of out of
[04:02.200 --> 04:07.320]  their own troubles and and and borrow money in the process and fortunately for
[04:07.320 --> 04:11.160]  the United States we've been doing that for many many years but we've had the
[04:11.160 --> 04:18.560]  the ability to use our status as world as the world reserve currency that occurs
[04:18.560 --> 04:22.600]  because of people want to buy oil out of out of the Middle East they had to buy
[04:22.600 --> 04:27.280]  US dollar first in order to have the ability to purchase that oil countries
[04:27.280 --> 04:31.680]  right now are looking at ways to get out of that agreement as quickly as
[04:31.680 --> 04:36.360]  possible call Midas today we do have just a wonderful buy I'm holding gold

[06:11.440 --> 06:15.800]  think all of us would like to see the Obama deception completely destroys the
[06:15.800 --> 06:19.800]  myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people while

[06:33.840 --> 06:40.320]  that's fascism it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government

[08:02.440 --> 08:14.600]  rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network well the associated
[08:14.600 --> 08:19.720]  press and politico have both reported in the last month that Obama has an
[08:19.720 --> 08:25.120]  enemy's list we know Bill Clinton had one now the globe which is about as good
[08:25.120 --> 08:28.640]  as the inquire though they don't do bat boy and aliens landing in Central Park
[08:28.640 --> 08:32.800]  they claim that they have a White House source with the enemy's list I think
[08:32.800 --> 08:37.520]  this is a public threat to people and we're gonna go on over that after Ray
[08:37.520 --> 08:43.840]  McGovern leaves us Ray McGovern is one of President Ronald Reagan's
[08:43.840 --> 08:48.320]  intelligence briefers from 81 to 85 he was in charge of the preparing the
[08:48.320 --> 08:51.800]  daily security briefings for Reagan and Vice President George Herbert Walker
[08:51.800 --> 08:55.160]  Bush and the National Security Advisor the Joint Chiefs of Staff and a
[08:55.160 --> 09:00.200]  cabinet later McGovern was one of several senior CI analyst who prepared
[09:00.200 --> 09:04.160]  the president's daily briefing during the first Bush administration he also
[09:04.160 --> 09:10.000]  famously challenged then Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at a press
[09:10.000 --> 09:16.440]  conference where are the WMD's and of course the Defense Secretary said I
[09:16.440 --> 09:21.240]  never said they had WMD's and he quoted Rumsfeld back and and really
[09:21.240 --> 09:27.000]  devastated Rumsfeld and that was really a turning point because Rumsfeld had
[09:27.000 --> 09:30.600]  been saying they had the WMD's and where they were in and around to Crete then he
[09:30.600 --> 09:35.200]  had to back off so I really respect Ray McGovern's analysis he was also a
[09:35.200 --> 09:40.240]  infantry commander during the Vietnam era as well in the army of memory serves
[09:40.240 --> 09:44.920]  correctly and he's been two years in remission from lymphatic cancer so we're
[09:44.920 --> 09:50.320]  excited to have him here with us and doing better than ever joining us is Ray
[09:50.320 --> 09:56.000]  McGovern Ray good to have you here with us thank you Alex Ray from memory don't
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.640]  you have a new book out too well I don't write books because then I lose my wife
[10:00.640 --> 10:05.360]  somebody saying they heard you on Dallas radio about a book or something maybe
[10:05.360 --> 10:09.640]  you were talking about somebody else's book I was yeah I was talking about JFK
[10:09.640 --> 10:15.280]  and the unspeakable which is a book that people really should read it's by
[10:15.280 --> 10:22.640]  James Douglas and it goes over the very the most recently released data on the
[10:22.640 --> 10:29.840]  situation there in Dallas and elsewhere when John Kennedy was assassinated you
[10:29.840 --> 10:34.560]  know very interesting you know I had dinner with Martin Sheen about a month
[10:34.560 --> 10:38.760]  ago and he said it was the best JFK book he had read and was raving about it I
[10:38.760 --> 10:42.400]  forgot to get a copy of it he was gonna give me a copy of it but I forgot to get
[10:42.400 --> 10:46.480]  it why is everybody saying this book is so powerful I mean you're a former top
[10:46.480 --> 10:51.760]  CIA analyst you're reading it yourself I want to get into Iran but that's a
[10:51.760 --> 10:57.040]  subject I never raised with you is JFK why are you so impressed with this book
[10:57.040 --> 11:01.160]  well Alex I have to confess that someone sent me that book about a year and a
[11:01.160 --> 11:07.080]  half ago and as soon as I heard that they had this theory that it was the CIA
[11:07.080 --> 11:12.560]  the Joint Chiefs of Staff and people who had been subordined in the Secret
[11:12.560 --> 11:18.840]  Service that planned and executed the assassination of John Kennedy as I heard
[11:18.840 --> 11:22.960]  that I said well this is pretty far out I got lots of articles to write I put it
[11:22.960 --> 11:28.120]  on my back shelf but recently I've been reading it I've almost almost finished
[11:28.120 --> 11:33.440]  and I share the view of the those who who have read it before and told me that
[11:33.440 --> 11:39.920]  it's the most painstakingly researched piece of work and that it includes the
[11:39.920 --> 11:44.440]  very latest data that's been released from FOIAs or from other things he
[11:44.440 --> 11:50.600]  conducted incredible interviews with people on the spot and the evidence that
[11:50.600 --> 11:55.480]  he adduces and you know I'm an intelligence analyst so I know a little bit about this
[11:55.480 --> 12:03.640]  can't think is very very persuasive and the reason that it has such current
[12:03.640 --> 12:10.920]  attention and applicability is because the very forces that Jim Douglas claims
[12:10.920 --> 12:19.960]  did JFK and are still very much around are still very much intimidating a new
[12:19.960 --> 12:25.840]  president whose name happens to be Barack Obama and if you just run down the
[12:25.840 --> 12:34.200]  line of things it was Cuba mostly because JFK would not save the abortion
[12:34.200 --> 12:41.320]  Bay of Pigs invasion 1961 the CIA and the Joint Chiefs got very mad about that
[12:41.320 --> 12:48.280]  when JFK wouldn't want a nuclear war on the Soviet Union during the missile
[12:48.280 --> 12:54.560]  crisis in in 62 that got the Joint Chiefs really mad because they know they
[12:54.560 --> 12:58.480]  have the advantage and they they told look mr. president it would only mean
[12:58.480 --> 13:02.880]  about 20 million of us killed but we kill all the Russians that kind of logic
[13:02.880 --> 13:08.560]  that was LL limits are in Kirtles LeMay wasn't it yeah yeah it was yeah it was
[13:08.560 --> 13:13.160]  that crowd that that crowd was described by George Ball the deputy
[13:13.160 --> 13:18.080]  secretary of state as a cesspool they're the ones that plan things like
[13:18.080 --> 13:22.320]  Northwood said and other things so there's the primary it's hard to put
[13:22.320 --> 13:27.840]  yourself back into those years but there was such a an incredible visceral
[13:27.840 --> 13:32.640]  nature anti-communism that again the Joint Chiefs thought it'd be just fine
[13:32.640 --> 13:37.760]  if we did in all the Soviet Union in return to just you know maybe 20 20
[13:37.760 --> 13:43.520]  million casualties here John Kennedy faced into that and not only that but
[13:43.520 --> 13:49.320]  he started talking with Castro independently and secretly he thought
[13:49.320 --> 13:54.080]  was the CIA go about it and he had a private correspondence with Nikita
[13:54.080 --> 13:59.000]  Khushroff he made a big speech at American University saying we ought to
[13:59.000 --> 14:03.040]  get along with the Soviet Union and what do you know but three months later
[14:03.040 --> 14:09.520]  the limited taxpayer treaty is signed the the JCS the Joint Chiefs for staff
[14:09.520 --> 14:15.400]  was cut out of those negotiations so you can understand how they felt about that
[14:15.400 --> 14:21.040]  last but not least was Vietnam where John Kennedy was convinced it was a
[14:21.040 --> 14:26.240]  fool's errand and he could not convince the Joint Chiefs nor his immediate
[14:26.240 --> 14:32.160]  advisors like Dr. Marin Rusk and so he had to sort of surreptitiously move
[14:32.160 --> 14:37.200]  toward removing all our troops and before he died he ordered that the first
[14:37.200 --> 14:43.040]  thousand troops he brought home before the end of the year 63 and he started
[14:43.040 --> 14:48.040]  issuing US greenbacks and was beginning to phase out the Federal Reserve and
[14:48.040 --> 14:53.640]  giving anti-fever reserve speeches yeah he was running into lots of problems and
[14:53.640 --> 14:58.560]  you know when Dwight Eisenhower warned about the military industrial complex
[14:58.560 --> 15:04.720]  well already what he was seeing was a military industrial congressional
[15:04.720 --> 15:09.960]  media complex which we have in full swing right now and so he's really up
[15:09.960 --> 15:14.000]  against it and so I admire him even more than I used to in facing right into
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.880]  that and it's not at all difficult for me to believe anymore that the people
[15:19.880 --> 15:25.440]  who both felt personally threatened and also felt that this fellow was selling
[15:25.440 --> 15:29.960]  out to the communists took it upon themselves to plan this thing carry it
[15:29.960 --> 15:34.760]  off and then then appoint people to investigate it in quotes so we come
[15:34.760 --> 15:39.400]  out with the right the best the right conclusion the politically correct
[15:39.400 --> 15:45.600]  conclusion that this Lee Harvey Oswald did it all alone no one believes that
[15:45.600 --> 15:52.200]  anymore so you know the applicability of this thing with his Barack Obama is
[15:52.200 --> 15:58.600]  big be ribbed and be meddled the general officers are telling him we're gonna
[15:58.600 --> 16:04.520]  suffer defeat in in Afghanistan if you don't give us 40 45,000 more troops
[16:04.520 --> 16:10.960]  that's exactly the same situation that JFK face what about the secret Pentagon
[16:10.960 --> 16:14.160]  document that came out two weeks ago is there any validity to that from your
[16:14.160 --> 16:18.360]  research Ray McGovern where they're saying they need 500,000 troops over
[16:18.360 --> 16:23.400]  the next five years well you know Andrea Mitchell ran with that and I was really
[16:23.400 --> 16:28.560]  surprised because all the information that subsequently emerged it does not
[16:28.560 --> 16:35.040]  the does not indicate that that document talked about 500,000 what I think
[16:35.040 --> 16:41.560]  people did perhaps was interpolate they look at the ratio that the current
[16:41.560 --> 16:46.920]  army manual says the ratio of troops to two citizens that is necessary for a
[16:46.920 --> 16:52.520]  successful insurgency and you multiply the numbers by the 38 million
[16:52.520 --> 16:57.760]  Afghans and you get you know 500,000 or more troops that would be yeah that was
[16:57.760 --> 17:03.000]  the original secretary white told Bush you need 500,000 or 450,000 to be
[17:03.000 --> 17:08.040]  technical and Bush said no I can do it with 150 and I guess they're 23 million
[17:08.040 --> 17:13.440]  in Iraq so the ratio would be above 500,000 wouldn't it exactly right and
[17:13.440 --> 17:18.520]  when you say 23 million in Iraq I have to tell your listeners that they used to
[17:18.520 --> 17:25.800]  be 27 million in Iraq that's not to say four million killed but four million
[17:25.800 --> 17:30.920]  have been displaced a billion I believe have been killed and you have many
[17:30.920 --> 17:35.600]  millions two million that's living internally as refugees at two and a
[17:35.600 --> 17:41.240]  half million living in a joint state. Ray McGovern shifting gears I want to in
[17:41.240 --> 17:44.440]  the 40 minutes we have left with you I want to get your because I mean it's
[17:44.440 --> 17:47.680]  what you brief the president's on you are an expert on these regions and talk
[17:47.680 --> 17:51.480]  to the other experts who are specifically specialists in these areas the
[17:51.480 --> 17:55.880]  geopolitical setup they're now admitting that Russia did not sneak attack
[17:55.880 --> 18:00.200]  Georgia it was the other way around Obama is doing the right thing saying he's
[18:00.200 --> 18:03.600]  gonna pull missile systems out but then he's hedging his bets when I've seen
[18:03.600 --> 18:08.560]  saying maybe some new system down the road so what you see happening in Iran
[18:08.560 --> 18:15.000]  Pakistan Afghanistan the US-Russian relationship and where all this is going
[18:15.000 --> 18:19.200]  and then of course the 64 million dollar question I want to cover first from
[18:19.200 --> 18:22.680]  what I've read the Iranian said okay in a few months we're gonna open this new
[18:22.680 --> 18:27.280]  facility they announced it our media spun it and said we found a secret
[18:27.280 --> 18:33.520]  location and it looks to me like another big lie or am I incorrect well
[18:33.520 --> 18:42.800]  unfortunately you're correct Alex what we have here is Iraq part two you
[18:42.800 --> 18:48.480]  remember how the what I call the fawning corporate media how they spun
[18:48.480 --> 18:52.560]  Iraq so we're all left to believe that there were weapons of mass destruction
[18:52.560 --> 18:57.040]  there and ties between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda none of that was right and
[18:57.040 --> 19:02.840]  none of the hype that's going on now with respect to the quotient Iranian
[19:02.840 --> 19:09.760]  nuclear threat and quote is right it's hyperbole to the nth degree and people in
[19:09.760 --> 19:15.000]  Congress in particular are feeding having a feeding frenzy on things that
[19:15.000 --> 19:18.720]  they have so warped that the American citizen can't really understand what's
[19:18.720 --> 19:23.160]  going on okay try to put it in in some context okay do that after we got a
[19:23.160 --> 19:26.320]  break we're gonna come back I'm gonna give me the floor I want you to break
[19:26.320 --> 19:30.280]  this down because I remember two and a half weeks ago the Iranians have got all
[19:30.280 --> 19:35.240]  these different sites they had the UN admits it can't get uranium above 95
[19:35.240 --> 19:39.080]  percent to make weapons the Iranians announced here's a new site we've got
[19:39.080 --> 19:45.120]  and then the media hoaxes it saying they've got it it was secret we found
[19:45.120 --> 19:49.360]  it boy we better attack them Netanyahu is making secret trips to Russia to get
[19:49.360 --> 19:53.560]  green light Russia starts saying we support sanctions what's your intel
[19:53.560 --> 19:57.520]  does that mean Russia's gonna back an attack we'll talk about it all with

[24:15.200 --> 24:19.040]  the years be very very accurate in hindsight joining us okay Ray you were
[24:19.040 --> 24:23.560]  getting into what's really happening with Iran and these sites and what you
[24:23.560 --> 24:27.800]  agreed is a big hoax saying that it was a secret site and they're gonna nuke us
[24:27.800 --> 24:34.520]  in 45 minutes changing the last letter in Iraq to Iran yeah well you got it
[24:34.520 --> 24:39.640]  Alex that's what's going on it's a type that's really unconscionable let me go
[24:39.640 --> 24:45.520]  back a little ways here because after the debacle on Iraq when my former
[24:45.520 --> 24:50.800]  colleagues were visited several times by the vice president his name is Cheney
[24:50.800 --> 24:56.240]  and then told to write it right at the National Intelligence estimate that said
[24:56.240 --> 25:01.600]  Saddam Hussein has all manner of weapons of mass destruction that was October 1
[25:01.600 --> 25:10.320]  2002 after that happened my former colleagues rose to the occasion said
[25:10.320 --> 25:13.680]  no more of that stuff we're not going to do that anymore we're going to tell the
[25:13.680 --> 25:18.200]  truth which reverts back to the kind of atmosphere in which I worked the only
[25:18.200 --> 25:22.560]  place in town without a political agenda the only place in town they can
[25:22.560 --> 25:27.840]  tell the president without pure favor what we really think now to make that
[25:27.840 --> 25:31.920]  that clear and when people say well how come you torture people they're
[25:31.920 --> 25:37.920]  basically two CIA's all right the one that obeys the president's wishes and is
[25:37.920 --> 25:42.960]  able to do that under the National Security Act 1947 the one that goes
[25:42.960 --> 25:47.920]  off and kidnaps people and tortures people that's not the CIA CIA I worked in
[25:47.920 --> 25:54.200]  I worked in the analysis part and the part of the covert agency that collected
[25:54.200 --> 25:58.880]  information okay and what I'm talking about now is that CIA and what do we do
[25:58.880 --> 26:05.840]  well we okay what did my former colleagues do well what we did I had to
[26:05.840 --> 26:16.360]  point a phrase is in 19 I'm sorry 2006 we gave Bush and Cheney the finger Tom
[26:16.360 --> 26:24.520]  finger if I NGAR who was an honest estimator incredibly bright came from
[26:24.520 --> 26:30.800]  the State Department and ran an estimate ran an estimate on Ron and it's
[26:30.800 --> 26:36.000]  nuclear program which is a bottom-up estimate they spent months and months and
[26:36.000 --> 26:40.640]  months re-looking at all the previous work taking into account the most
[26:40.640 --> 26:45.680]  recent information they came up with some startling conclusions conclusions
[26:45.680 --> 26:49.760]  that were at direct variance with what president and Cheney has been telling
[26:49.760 --> 26:55.600]  the world okay number one the NIE judged with quote high confidence and quote
[26:55.600 --> 27:02.580]  that Iran had halted had stopped a covert nuclear weapons program in the
[27:02.580 --> 27:10.520]  fall of 2003 and had not resumed work on this nuclear weapons aspect of its
[27:10.520 --> 27:15.760]  program this is an essential part of a nuclear program they stopped work on it
[27:15.760 --> 27:20.360]  and the latest briefing of Congress indicates that the CIA believes in the
[27:20.360 --> 27:24.640]  intelligence community as well that they did not restart this so this is a
[27:24.640 --> 27:30.440]  very curious way to be as Defense Secretary Gates says held bench on
[27:30.440 --> 27:34.840]  developing a nuclear weapon if you stopped let's see what's the man here
[27:34.840 --> 27:40.520]  six years ago okay and sir didn't they say at the time in the in the highly
[27:40.520 --> 27:44.480]  publicized report that if Iran restarted it it would take nine years
[27:44.480 --> 27:52.160]  oh well they said 2015 or so it was a kind of a bracketed thing and it all
[27:52.160 --> 27:57.800]  depended on how quickly they could enrich uranium to the weapons grade and
[27:57.800 --> 28:04.760]  also what kind of delivery system they could get now no one no one from a
[28:04.760 --> 28:10.640]  technical point of view said that Iran could be a threat to the United States
[28:10.640 --> 28:16.520]  in any time frame soon they have no ICBMs they have no method of delivering a
[28:16.520 --> 28:22.640]  weapon even if they have restarted their web their work on weapons who to whom
[28:22.640 --> 28:29.960]  are they a threat well there's one other country in that region who actually
[28:29.960 --> 28:37.720]  has 200 some people say 300 nuclear weapons deliverable by aircraft by
[28:37.720 --> 28:44.840]  submarines by surface ships by by missile and the name of that country is
[28:44.840 --> 28:49.640]  Israel and no one should shy away from mentioning that because that is the fly
[28:49.640 --> 28:57.640]  in the ointment if if there's a country in that region that has no it has not
[28:57.640 --> 29:04.600]  signed a non-proliferation agreement and has this kind of capability and the
[29:04.600 --> 29:09.400]  United States shows itself willing to invade a country like Iraq without that
[29:09.400 --> 29:13.760]  capability well if I were an Iranian you know I would think long and hard about
[29:13.760 --> 29:18.760]  being able to have the option to have that capability and so this estimate
[29:18.760 --> 29:25.240]  this estimate said we don't know whether the Iranians would would develop a
[29:25.240 --> 29:30.680]  nuclear weapon but the evidence is not there we will know in great time in
[29:30.680 --> 29:36.480]  enough time to know and take precautions and get them to negotiate but right
[29:36.480 --> 29:41.000]  bottom right here is there's there is time to negotiate long segment coming up
[29:41.000 --> 29:45.560]  we'll continue there look at the latest high Iran announces they've got a
[29:45.560 --> 29:49.640]  facility the media spends it says we found a secret facility we've got to
[29:49.640 --> 29:56.680]  attack we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[35:05.160 --> 35:12.200]  government right you'd left off with the CIA assessment 2006 and then now we
[35:12.200 --> 35:16.160]  fast forward to they've taken some troops out of Iraq replaced them with
[35:16.160 --> 35:22.160]  contractors put 20 to 30,000 more troops and contractors in Afghanistan
[35:22.160 --> 35:27.360]  they're saying on the news we caught a secret nuke factory we we caught them we
[35:27.360 --> 35:32.080]  caught them it's incredible and then a few days later oh did we catch them well
[35:32.080 --> 35:36.680]  they made the announcement after they knew we knew so so so break down what's
[35:36.680 --> 35:43.200]  really happening today yeah well we didn't we caught them several several
[35:43.200 --> 35:49.640]  months ago Alex and and they announced the existence of this new enrichment
[35:49.640 --> 35:55.920]  plant on their own initiative and they did that just a week before the
[35:55.920 --> 36:00.960]  negotiation start your listeners perhaps need to be reminded that tomorrow is a
[36:00.960 --> 36:06.480]  very big day because the five security council members plus Germany and Iran
[36:06.480 --> 36:13.120]  are getting together talk about the Iranian nuclear program now that's why
[36:13.120 --> 36:19.560]  the hype is the pitch that it is they're trying to the media here are trying to
[36:19.560 --> 36:23.720]  hype this thing up and say well look now we've discovered a new enrichment
[36:23.720 --> 36:29.000]  facility well we know about that every city for four months and now the
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.040]  Iranians are claiming that they're well within their rights under the treaties
[36:33.040 --> 36:36.800]  governing this kind of activity to announce the establishment of this
[36:36.800 --> 36:41.400]  thing because it's several several months more before it gets ready to enrich
[36:41.400 --> 36:47.640]  anything so the hype is there and that the bottom line people you just need to
[36:47.640 --> 36:56.360]  realize that Iran is nowhere near Iran is years and years away from a nuclear
[36:56.360 --> 37:00.360]  weapon okay I'll repeat that one more time years away from a nuclear weapon
[37:00.360 --> 37:04.280]  don't believe the hype don't believe what the Israelis are saying these are
[37:04.280 --> 37:09.120]  technical questions okay now when I did the president's daily brief yeah I
[37:09.120 --> 37:12.960]  didn't write all the briefs obviously I know who the right I know who the good
[37:12.960 --> 37:18.600]  analysts were the honest technical people and and it was a it was a privilege
[37:18.600 --> 37:23.040]  to to put their stuff in readable form and give it to the president well now I
[37:23.040 --> 37:26.760]  still know those folks and I'm not getting this from a government head I'm
[37:26.760 --> 37:31.640]  getting it for people like Greg Keelman who ran the State Department the INR
[37:31.640 --> 37:36.000]  the research there and the the intelligence outfit at the State
[37:36.000 --> 37:41.960]  Department was right his people were right before the Iraq estimate there in
[37:41.960 --> 37:47.720]  2002 and he now writes for the arms control association and it's the best
[37:47.720 --> 37:51.960]  stuff out there just Google arms control association you'll see what
[37:51.960 --> 37:57.640]  Greg Keelman is putting together boil it down for us then what does Iran really
[37:57.640 --> 38:01.960]  have what are they really doing and a why can Israel have weapons why can
[38:01.960 --> 38:06.440]  Pakistan have weapons why is that okay but Iran's nowhere near it and we're
[38:06.440 --> 38:11.440]  hearing we got to put sanctions on them we got to attack them you know they could
[38:11.440 --> 38:17.080]  they could kill us any minute well Alex there will be no news to you that there
[38:17.080 --> 38:22.480]  is something in this country that I call the Lee Koot lobby Lee Koot being the
[38:22.480 --> 38:28.000]  hard-right faction of the Israeli government Israeli parties and they
[38:28.000 --> 38:32.920]  have an ordinate influence in this country and if you were to ask why it is
[38:32.920 --> 38:39.200]  that Congress is preparing actually preparing as we speak to pass a law that
[38:39.200 --> 38:44.720]  would actually be an act of war and to interject the supply of gasoline and
[38:44.720 --> 38:50.880]  such products to Iran why they're doing that well it's because a lot of their
[38:50.880 --> 38:56.560]  money and a lot of their votes come from what I call the Koot lobby people so
[38:56.560 --> 39:01.320]  why does Israel want to attack Iran well you know if you look at the Israelis
[39:01.320 --> 39:07.520]  and their their frame of mind and I think it's a terribly myopic frame of
[39:07.520 --> 39:12.080]  mind I care about what happens to Israel and I think it's exactly the wrong
[39:12.080 --> 39:18.840]  policy they think they think that if they can sap the Iranian nuclear facility
[39:18.840 --> 39:25.880]  as they did to the facility you know Seorok in Iraq in 1983 then they could set
[39:25.880 --> 39:30.040]  the Iranians back go five ten years perhaps if they're allowed to do that
[39:30.040 --> 39:35.320]  now that's very myopic because the Iranians unlike the Iraqis in those
[39:35.320 --> 39:41.440]  days Iranians can retaliate they can close the streets they can decimate our
[39:41.440 --> 39:47.240]  troops in Iraq and they can hit Israeli cities even now not with a nuclear
[39:47.240 --> 39:52.360]  weapon but with lots of missiles okay so it would be bedlam if this happened and
[39:52.360 --> 39:57.400]  yet the Israelis are trying to get far okay to let them do it this is this is
[39:57.400 --> 40:02.800]  lunacy but they have this kind of the frame of mind Netanyahu their Prime
[40:02.800 --> 40:07.360]  Minister in particular that this must not be let to happen and that they're
[40:07.360 --> 40:12.320]  going to delay it as long as they can if it takes an arm strike they'll do it now
[40:12.320 --> 40:17.320]  the only thing that is preventing them from doing it at this point in my
[40:17.320 --> 40:22.560]  estimation is this Admiral Mullen chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was
[40:22.560 --> 40:27.440]  responsible for our troops and our security has gone over to Israel this
[40:27.440 --> 40:33.280]  time last year and said look don't even think about it okay you fly your planes
[40:33.280 --> 40:39.280]  over our airspace in Iraq we shoot them down okay so don't even think about this
[40:39.280 --> 40:44.040]  and don't don't think you can perpetrate the kind of incident like the liberty
[40:44.040 --> 40:49.680]  incident back in June of 68 because we remember that I'm a naval officer and
[40:49.680 --> 40:54.240]  that's just not going to happen again now that was pretty gutsy and that put
[40:54.240 --> 40:58.000]  the bush and what the Israelis were planning the following August last
[40:58.000 --> 41:04.800]  August not last August but August of 08 let me go back we had the Admiral you
[41:04.800 --> 41:15.200]  just talked about and then it leaked it also leaked that and a New Yorker
[41:15.200 --> 41:19.960]  covered it MSNBC covered it Sy Hirsh talked about it we'd all heard about
[41:19.960 --> 41:24.840]  how these radio calls were coming in Iranian patrol boats attack blow up the
[41:24.840 --> 41:29.200]  destroyers near the Strait of Hormuz they're in the Gulf and then it came out
[41:29.200 --> 41:33.680]  later that Cheney was discussing plans to paint up US ships like Iranian
[41:33.680 --> 41:42.280]  patrol boats and have them attack our ships now this came out a year after
[41:42.280 --> 41:47.040]  you on this show and other shows said what I'm hearing from intelligent
[41:47.040 --> 41:52.520]  sources is they may attack our ships and blame it on Iran were you being given
[41:52.520 --> 41:57.160]  specifics because it's one thing to get this from Sy Hirsh a year after it
[41:57.160 --> 42:02.120]  happened now two years ago it's another thing for you and I remember the
[42:02.120 --> 42:06.760]  interviews a year before to say that's what you were concerned about well Alex
[42:06.760 --> 42:10.800]  I wish I could brag about an inside source on this particular thing I cannot
[42:10.800 --> 42:16.360]  I was using what we in army intelligence used to call the swag factor you know what
[42:16.360 --> 42:24.920]  that is no that's a scientific wild ass guess so it's thin slicing or it's dead
[42:24.920 --> 42:29.480]  reckoning yeah it's you know try to put yourself in the position of the Israelis
[42:29.480 --> 42:35.800]  and what success they had with the the incident there where they killed the 34
[42:35.800 --> 42:44.080]  of our seamen there and I won't do the 171 and in June 8th 1967 and you know
[42:44.080 --> 42:49.600]  they're they talk about moxie or what's but they were quite capable of doing it
[42:49.600 --> 42:53.560]  again particularly if they had an ally and the vice president of the United
[42:53.560 --> 42:58.560]  States which clearly they did and when Sy Hirsh came out with that a year later
[42:58.560 --> 43:03.360]  you can imagine my reaction I said wow that was a good guess McGovern but it
[43:03.360 --> 43:09.360]  was just at that point I guess okay we had Bear on the former CIA fellow for
[43:09.360 --> 43:14.280]  folks that don't know up there yeah and and and he said two years ago and I
[43:14.280 --> 43:20.040]  don't trust him as much as I trust you obvious for obvious reasons but he said
[43:20.040 --> 43:27.440]  I'm worried about the Saudis staging a false flag to blame it on Iran and then
[43:27.440 --> 43:33.200]  now we see more and more similar things coming out along those lines what's your
[43:33.200 --> 43:37.680]  take on that well Bob knows the area a lot better than I do and I have great
[43:37.680 --> 43:44.520]  confidence and in his judgment you know the Saudis or Sunni the Iranians are
[43:44.520 --> 43:51.040]  Shia it may seem like lunacy to us but matters a great deal in that area and for
[43:51.040 --> 43:55.560]  the Iranians to become the preponderant power in that area well the Saudis
[43:55.560 --> 43:58.680]  don't like that at all whether they would resort to this kind of provocation
[43:58.680 --> 44:04.560]  or not and I don't know but Bob would be in a much better position to
[44:04.560 --> 44:11.040]  speculate on that well I mean what is it like for you knowing the region studying
[44:11.040 --> 44:16.080]  it when they get up on the news and say Iran is backing al-Qaeda in Afghanistan
[44:16.080 --> 44:20.080]  that when it's the opposite groups see it Shunni arch enemies you know they they
[44:20.080 --> 44:23.000]  fight more than they do with Christians or Jews really if you look at the
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.320]  statistics that I've looked at I mean that's so if that's like saying the
[44:26.320 --> 44:31.560]  Dallas Cowboys are the are the New York Giants I mean it's clearly two
[44:31.560 --> 44:36.680]  different groups and then the famous case two and a half years ago with the
[44:36.680 --> 44:41.880]  president of Afghanistan and Bush says yes Iran is funding Taliban al-Qaeda in
[44:41.880 --> 44:47.080]  Afghanistan and Muhammad Karzai says excuse me your Excellency respectfully
[44:47.080 --> 44:52.120]  but Iran's helping us their enemy is al-Qaeda they're back on the news as you
[44:52.120 --> 44:57.400]  know saying that Iran is al-Qaeda when the last White House admitted they were
[44:57.400 --> 45:03.440]  using al-Qaeda based groups to stage terror attacks inside Iran yeah well an
[45:03.440 --> 45:09.120]  answer to your question Alex I take this blood pressure medicine now so this
[45:09.120 --> 45:14.800]  kind of stuff but all kidding aside you know when when Bush was allowed to
[45:14.800 --> 45:19.920]  mischaracterize maybe a nice way of saying things all these very important
[45:19.920 --> 45:24.800]  developments and the mainstream press that people like your Charlie Gibson
[45:24.800 --> 45:31.160]  would just kind of say oh I refer specifically to Bush's famous exit
[45:31.160 --> 45:35.400]  interview where Charlie Gibson finally said well Mr. President why did you
[45:35.400 --> 45:40.360]  really think you had to attack Iraq and he's always simple I thought I was
[45:40.360 --> 45:45.000]  saying wouldn't let the UN inspectors in and Charlie Gibson so oh okay
[45:45.000 --> 45:51.360]  question you know but he was letting the inspector they were they were coming
[45:51.360 --> 45:54.920]  through his palaces they were interviewing his scientists one-on-one
[45:54.920 --> 46:00.040]  it was George Bush that threw the UN inspectors out two days before shock
[46:00.040 --> 46:04.360]  at all and Charlie Gibson was sitting away with that let's get back to Iran
[46:04.360 --> 46:08.160]  here's you know I told you about the estimate here it actually appeared in
[46:08.160 --> 46:13.920]  November of 07 they started working on it at 06 and so November 07 this big
[46:13.920 --> 46:18.920]  shock namely that the NIE judges and I used to chair these things I know what
[46:18.920 --> 46:23.960]  kind of work was into this high confidence that Tehran had halted a
[46:23.960 --> 46:29.360]  covert nuclear weapons program in the fall of 2003 was the president say the
[46:29.360 --> 46:35.240]  following March he says quote Iran has declared that he wants to be a nuclear
[46:35.240 --> 46:40.000]  power with a weapon to destroy people including others in the Middle East and
[46:40.000 --> 46:45.880]  quote you know that's made up that you know you make that kind of stuff up but
[46:45.880 --> 46:49.320]  you shouldn't be allowed to get away with it Iran never declared any such
[46:49.320 --> 46:52.520]  thing it's a matter of fact the intelligence people were telling the
[46:52.520 --> 46:57.040]  president that he might have ceased work on the nuclear weapons and now they're
[46:57.040 --> 47:00.680]  hyping that again I was watching CNN this morning and they cut to some female
[47:00.680 --> 47:07.040]  blonde-haired comedian I missed her name as if it was news they go let's cut to
[47:07.040 --> 47:11.760]  see what she says about Iran she's like Ahmed Denizade how dare you say you want
[47:11.760 --> 47:15.680]  to nuke us and blow everything up how dare you we see through you little man
[47:15.680 --> 47:21.640]  little devil and then she laughs and I'm like this is news now when they always
[47:21.640 --> 47:25.840]  distort what he says and I'm certainly not defending him or the mullahs or any
[47:25.840 --> 47:30.680]  of them over there the point is is that it's all being manufactured again
[47:30.680 --> 47:35.040]  they're beating the war drums here's the big issue do you think they're gonna
[47:35.040 --> 47:39.440]  hit them or will it be sanctions first or will they false flag or where is this
[47:39.440 --> 47:47.640]  going well it depends on how staunchly the only reputable institution in our
[47:47.640 --> 47:54.080]  government stands up to this I have a lot of admiration for Edmo Mullen I
[47:54.080 --> 48:00.560]  think that you know he's inclined and you know put nature to obey orders but
[48:00.560 --> 48:05.560]  he and his predecessor Admiral Fallon you remember Fallon quit when he was sent
[48:05.560 --> 48:09.760]  to become commander because he had said we're not going to do you run on my
[48:09.760 --> 48:15.080]  watch and it took several months but he was because he knows what will happen we
[48:15.080 --> 48:18.520]  should talk about what will happen the three different scenarios in Iran gets
[48:18.520 --> 48:22.440]  hit that's exactly right you know and one of them you know one of us as well
[48:22.440 --> 48:28.080]  Iran has the capability of closing the streets of hormones now okay that's
[48:28.080 --> 48:32.120]  where like two-thirds of the oil that comes out of the oil rich Middle East
[48:32.120 --> 48:36.840]  has to come through okay now what's uh what's Mullen say to that question he
[48:36.840 --> 48:42.800]  says yes the Iranians have the capability of closing the streets but but we
[48:42.800 --> 48:47.560]  can reopen them well yeah how are they going to reopen them send the marine
[48:47.560 --> 48:52.720]  division into the cliffs overlooking the streets of hormones give me a break
[48:52.720 --> 48:57.360]  we're not 12,000 Sunburn missiles aiming down yeah and we're gonna get the
[48:57.360 --> 49:04.200]  marine division they're all they're all already exhausted and in Afghanistan and
[49:04.200 --> 49:09.080]  some of them left Iraq so you know if this all has a degree of unreality and
[49:09.080 --> 49:15.360]  when I see Senator Kid Bond of Missouri and John Kyle talking about we need
[49:15.360 --> 49:19.520]  regime change we need regime change in Iran because there's such a threat to
[49:19.520 --> 49:24.240]  Israel well you know that just reminds me of the old saw about you know when they
[49:24.240 --> 49:31.120]  offered to make Israel the 51st state of the United States Israel refused it you
[49:31.120 --> 49:40.000]  know why Alex no why because then they'd only have two senators oh man I you know
[49:40.000 --> 49:45.880]  this is just insane so what's the intel you're getting are they planning to hit
[49:45.880 --> 49:50.720]  Iran or are they just gonna have sanctions where is this going I think
[49:50.720 --> 49:57.120]  Netanyahu is shaping at the bit and I think Obama is on the great pressure
[49:57.120 --> 50:02.760]  from the greekhood lobby and from those still in the White House who have great
[50:02.760 --> 50:07.160]  difficulty distinguishing between what they perceive to be the strategic
[50:07.160 --> 50:12.120]  interests of Israel on the one hand and those of the United States on the other
[50:12.120 --> 50:18.520]  I I hope and that's what it is a hope it's just a little bit more than a little
[50:18.520 --> 50:22.800]  less than an expectation that Obama will stand up to this this would be a
[50:22.800 --> 50:28.120]  ruinous war this would be worse than the way he contemplates doing in Afghanistan
[50:28.120 --> 50:32.240]  this would be bedlam and I think that is as long as he listens to people like
[50:32.240 --> 50:37.720]  Mullen that he'll be restrained final segment with Ray McGovern straight
[50:37.720 --> 50:42.120]  ahead want to get his take on the Russia situation where he thinks Afghanistan
[50:42.120 --> 50:46.640]  is going I just wish we could stop having all these wars I mean our
[50:46.640 --> 50:50.840]  government has overthrown Iran repeatedly they're constantly meddling
[50:50.840 --> 50:55.400]  inside their nation we've really done this country wrong folks and now they're
[50:55.400 --> 50:59.640]  saying they're gonna nuke us I mean it's just pure bull
[51:00.640 --> 51:05.600]  are you suffering from issues related to angina pain high blood pressure
[51:05.600 --> 51:09.720]  congestive heart failure unbalanced cholesterol irregular heartbeats

[54:21.920 --> 54:27.240]  Ray McGovern is our guest final segment Ray what about the rest of the world
[54:27.240 --> 54:31.920]  geopolitically what's going on but what's going on is the rest of the world
[54:31.920 --> 54:37.640]  is looking at us and kind of shaking shaking its head the Russians and the
[54:37.640 --> 54:41.920]  Chinese and the Indians are the big players of course as they watch what
[54:41.920 --> 54:47.440]  we're trying to do in Afghanistan you know this sort of the shrugging their
[54:47.440 --> 54:51.760]  shoulders and saying well be our guests you know who we all tried that in
[54:51.760 --> 54:56.560]  Afghanistan we all fail going back to you know going back to I was into the
[54:56.560 --> 55:02.000]  great not to mention Chinggis Khan and the Persians and the Indians and the
[55:02.000 --> 55:07.160]  British and the Russians and go ahead you know we'll waste your your military
[55:07.160 --> 55:13.640]  and with respect to with Iran you know the Russians used to care a great deal
[55:13.640 --> 55:18.560]  about what happened on their soft southern underbelly but they seemed
[55:18.560 --> 55:24.160]  almost cavalier with respect to Iranian plans and I think part of that has to do
[55:24.160 --> 55:31.120]  with the fact that they they don't have Israel as their quote ally and quote now
[55:31.120 --> 55:37.120]  what are these quotes well because 99% of American people believe that Israel is
[55:37.120 --> 55:42.560]  an ally of the United States that's wrong an alliance requires a treaty there
[55:42.560 --> 55:47.040]  is no mutual defense treaty between the United States and Israel and the reason
[55:47.040 --> 55:52.600]  there is none is because treaties require internationally recognized
[55:52.600 --> 55:58.920]  boundaries and Israel is in possession for over 60 years now no 60 years from
[55:58.920 --> 56:06.040]  67 on till now whatever the math is of the occupied territory West Bank East
[56:06.040 --> 56:11.560]  Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip and Israel last thing it wants is to have any
[56:11.560 --> 56:17.400]  international body draw the borders back to where they used to be so there is no
[56:17.400 --> 56:23.480]  alliance and yet we proceed and the media characterizes our relationship with
[56:23.480 --> 56:28.880]  Israel as an alliance our policymakers treated that way but Russia Russia sits
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.520]  back and laughs and says well if they do something really idiotic if they close
[56:33.520 --> 56:40.440]  the streets of our moves yes who benefits who benefits Russia Russia has got
[56:40.440 --> 56:44.400]  only oil you know man at the price of oil you know we'll be able to have a
[56:44.400 --> 56:49.840]  villa we'll have a dacha for each for each little worker in the Russia is that
[56:49.840 --> 56:53.720]  why Russia met with Netanyahu secretly a month ago and has now said with they
[56:53.720 --> 56:58.280]  support sanctions against Iran well you know Russia plays a very clever game
[56:58.280 --> 57:03.000]  you know they express concern about this and then they go ahead now with
[57:03.000 --> 57:09.680]  Netanyahu they are restraining influence although they don't care as much as we
[57:09.680 --> 57:16.400]  do so when Netanyahu goes up there what you expect him to get is not approval
[57:16.400 --> 57:21.520]  for a strike on Iran but some sort of reassurance that for example the Russians
[57:21.520 --> 57:29.120]  won't won't sell sophisticated missiles to defend the Iranian sites there at the
[57:29.120 --> 57:38.880]  Richmond site so you know last year a hood owner went to to Moscow and he was
[57:38.880 --> 57:44.160]  summoned there and the Russians warned him in similarly definitive terms like
[57:44.160 --> 57:49.600]  Admiral Mullen don't even think of attacking Iran so the Russians have no
[57:49.600 --> 57:54.560]  real incentive for that kind of attack but if it happens you know they're
[57:54.560 --> 57:59.080]  going to be the big good beneficiary by right doubling the price of their
[57:59.080 --> 58:03.040]  job for almost out of time in the last minute do you think it sanctions are an
[58:03.040 --> 58:06.760]  attack I mean if you had to make a dead reckoning again do you think they're
[58:06.760 --> 58:12.760]  gonna hit Iran the next year or two gosh I don't know Alex it will depend on how
[58:12.760 --> 58:17.920]  this thing plays out there will be sanctions first but there's great
[58:17.920 --> 58:22.920]  pressure for an attack and I would not rule out the likelihood that Israel would
[58:22.920 --> 58:27.880]  be given a nod by somebody in the White House and go ahead do it and force our
[58:27.880 --> 58:33.560]  hand and then Iran will go absolutely wild oh yeah it'll be bedlam and will
[58:33.560 --> 58:37.760]  suffer great attrition for our own troops in the area Ray McGovern thank

[59:01.880 --> 59:05.680]  chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water many of these
[59:05.680 --> 59:09.520]  chemicals are directly linked to cancer reproductive immune and developmental

[1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:26.480]  Alex Jones the New World Order is coming in like a flood all these years they
[1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:31.000]  said there was no world government being set up now it's just admitted they're
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:36.560]  testing the public they're probing taking some more phone calls here good old Paul
[1:00:36.560 --> 1:00:39.720]  Watson and Kurt Nemo we've got Mike Adams the Health Ranger coming up the
[1:00:39.720 --> 1:00:44.640]  next segment Annie in New York you're on the air welcome thank you so much Alex
[1:00:44.640 --> 1:00:49.280]  I'm the sister of Claire the daycare teacher who works for Northeast Health
[1:00:49.280 --> 1:00:53.640]  and we're going to that rally in Albany tomorrow and have everything on hold
[1:00:53.640 --> 1:00:57.120]  I was putting out some stuff from your site you know that the regular flu shot
[1:00:57.120 --> 1:01:01.720]  has H1N1 in it and some stuff from Dr. Horowitz we should probably expect
[1:01:01.720 --> 1:01:06.960]  that they're gonna be fed there in one way or another shouldn't we yeah you're
[1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:10.280]  evil Americans you're not allowed to go out and say we don't want to take the
[1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:14.360]  force flu shot that Obama says isn't forced though they are forcing it on
[1:01:14.360 --> 1:01:19.120]  healthcare workers again that's not American to go out and have free speech
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:25.520]  how dare you it's ridiculous my sister is being ostracized by her boss because
[1:01:25.520 --> 1:01:29.640]  you know she's been taken out of the her regular classrooms and given other
[1:01:29.640 --> 1:01:34.960]  duties like she's some kind of pariah I just feel so sorry for Alex I mean
[1:01:34.960 --> 1:01:39.400]  they're gonna take down the web eventually I wish that shortwave and
[1:01:39.400 --> 1:01:44.800]  CB retailers would advertise on your site because possibly we could get your
[1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:49.120]  show then on shortwave correct yes I'm on shortwave
[1:01:49.120 --> 1:01:54.160]  boy I wish they would advertise on your site and lastly Alex the camera has
[1:01:54.160 --> 1:01:57.640]  become mightier than the sword as evidenced by the punishment Luke
[1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:01.280]  Rodawarski got for making a fool of Brian Williams and God bless each and every
[1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:04.720]  one of you God bless you we'll bring this up to Mike Adams in the next
[1:02:04.720 --> 1:02:11.080]  segment but the closing out with the flu and with the secret police running
[1:02:11.080 --> 1:02:14.920]  around trying to intimidate people that speak out against it the flu really is
[1:02:14.920 --> 1:02:19.280]  the perfect cover for a takeover because it makes everybody a potential enemy and
[1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:23.200]  as Ron Paul said last Thursday here on air they're setting the precedent for
[1:02:23.200 --> 1:02:31.880]  this medicalized tyranny yeah the new story about that today is the UK
[1:02:31.880 --> 1:02:36.440]  government has come out on the Downing Street website and said that the swine
[1:02:36.440 --> 1:02:42.920]  flu vaccine will not be mandatory and yet it's as we've discussed before their
[1:02:42.920 --> 1:02:47.480]  private plans all revolve around it being a compulsory vaccination their
[1:02:47.480 --> 1:02:52.520]  preparation revolves around it being a compulsory vaccination they're making
[1:02:52.520 --> 1:02:57.360]  health workers take it by Monday or they're fired so while governments are
[1:02:57.360 --> 1:03:01.160]  publicly saying that it won't be mandatory all their planning indicates
[1:03:01.160 --> 1:03:06.520]  that the large sectors of the population it will be
[1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:13.280]  absolutely Kurt Nemo your take on that well I think that that he's right you
[1:03:13.280 --> 1:03:16.760]  know in this country they're starting with the health care workers and
[1:03:16.760 --> 1:03:21.880]  anybody who's in the in the public domain and trying to work down towards the
[1:03:21.880 --> 1:03:26.080]  general populace I'm not sure they'll make it they can force the worker that
[1:03:26.080 --> 1:03:29.800]  the health care enforcers to do it and the police to do it then they'll make
[1:03:29.800 --> 1:03:32.920]  us do it yeah you know we're gonna have a hard time doing that though they've
[1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:36.840]  only got the next two months to do it I think they're gonna get enough people
[1:03:36.840 --> 1:03:40.600]  just do this propagate this pervasive propaganda campaign to go and get the
[1:03:40.600 --> 1:03:45.520]  vaccine it's gonna be difficult for them to come and tell me to get a vaccine
[1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:50.360]  and my neighbors well that's the next phase shutting down roads set shutting
[1:03:50.360 --> 1:03:55.080]  down cities right making you have a bracelet or you don't get through well
[1:03:55.080 --> 1:03:59.080]  yeah if they can if they can make this into a pandemic you know this H1M one
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:04.080]  which is a total joke they may be able to do that well regardless they are
[1:04:04.080 --> 1:04:09.280]  gauging the response of the people worldwide to this for future forced
[1:04:09.280 --> 1:04:13.760]  inoculation campaigns or they could go hot with the program right now we'll
[1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:16.720]  talk about this with Mike Adams the health ranger who now lives in Ecuador
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:22.160]  full-time and he also writes for a natural news so that is coming up we'll

[1:08:24.880 --> 1:08:30.480]  Ecuador you know the bushes have bought land in South America hundreds of
[1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:34.720]  thousands of acres of it there are a lot of wealthy people here in Austin a lot
[1:08:34.720 --> 1:08:38.360]  of wealthy business people that I've run into over the years they tell me that a
[1:08:38.360 --> 1:08:42.200]  lot of the big money has left the last three years there's been news articles
[1:08:42.200 --> 1:08:46.360]  about that that's a side issue but Mike Adams the health ranger founder of
[1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:51.280]  naturalnews.com huge site an online news source covering all areas of personal
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:55.920]  and planetary wellness from nutrition to renewable energy and he's written
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:08:59.280]  thousands of articles and built a following over 800,000 people across the
[1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:02.920]  globe it's a lot more than that Mike has also found a non-profit organization the
[1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:06.920]  consumer wellness center an online retail center Better Life Goods and popular
[1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:11.680]  publishing company Truth Publishing he now lives in Ecuador and he joins us for
[1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:14.320]  the rest of the hour we're going to be opening the phones up on a host of issues
[1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:18.520]  but Mike you've certainly put your money where your mouth is down there trying
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:23.520]  to have a real sustainability something that UN tries to create an evil clone of
[1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:28.240]  why did you move to Ecuador well by the way thanks for having me on the show
[1:09:28.240 --> 1:09:31.920]  Alex it's a great honor to be with you again today but you're right
[1:09:31.920 --> 1:09:37.600]  sustainability and putting my money where my mouth is right now I'm living
[1:09:37.600 --> 1:09:43.800]  80% off of my own food supply down here and more importantly I'm able to to make
[1:09:43.800 --> 1:09:48.760]  sure that I can stay on the air so if things happen in the US with websites I
[1:09:48.760 --> 1:09:53.080]  know that I can host websites in other countries and I can continue to help
[1:09:53.080 --> 1:09:58.720]  reach people from Ecuador without being you know taken away by a US authority so
[1:09:58.720 --> 1:10:01.920]  there's a lot of reasons I'm here those are a couple of them what are you doing
[1:10:01.920 --> 1:10:07.040]  is it to keep from getting malaria I'm not in the jungles I'm actually in the
[1:10:07.040 --> 1:10:11.760]  high elevation andy that the perfect climate year-round spring like weather
[1:10:11.760 --> 1:10:17.200]  you think you're in paradise here and it it's really just crazy good weather
[1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:22.600]  and non-stop food production you can feed a family of four on about half an
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:27.800]  acre here yeah I've talked to filmmakers like the maker of crude big film that
[1:10:27.800 --> 1:10:31.600]  just came out it was 25 trips I think he said down there and I've seen the
[1:10:31.600 --> 1:10:35.560]  videos you've shot and put on your YouTube channel really good people there
[1:10:35.560 --> 1:10:42.240]  and so you're living in the high Andes yeah that's right it's high enough to
[1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:45.960]  get rid of the mosquitoes and the hot weather and like you hinted at the top
[1:10:45.960 --> 1:10:51.880]  of the hour there Alex there are a lot a lot of Americans and Canadians and
[1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:57.200]  British and Australians who are coming here for many of the same reason they're
[1:10:57.200 --> 1:11:01.880]  concerned about the swine flu pandemic vaccine response they're concerned about
[1:11:01.880 --> 1:11:04.680]  the global currency collapse that's coming they're concerned about their
[1:11:04.680 --> 1:11:08.320]  freedoms and many of them are coming here we have great neighbors here what
[1:11:08.320 --> 1:11:13.960]  about kidnapping I hear Ecuador's got a problem with that up in the north area
[1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:18.000]  near Colombia there is a kidnapping issue but we have really good
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:21.720]  relationships with all the local people here you know I speak a decent enough
[1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:26.040]  Spanish now to get by and and we're part of the community they you know we're
[1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:30.680]  valued members of this community we're not loners here so I don't have any
[1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:34.680]  concern about that well yeah that's the way it is I guess in Central and South
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:37.680]  America the people are the salty earth you've usually got a small criminal
[1:11:37.680 --> 1:11:41.800]  group feeding on them but from just looking at places to send my family if
[1:11:41.800 --> 1:11:46.320]  I have to the area of Ecuador you're in separate from your research does look
[1:11:46.320 --> 1:11:49.480]  like a pretty good area tell us tell us about your facility then I want to get
[1:11:49.480 --> 1:11:56.040]  into the flu okay sure well we we have some acreage here and we grow all kinds
[1:11:56.040 --> 1:12:01.440]  of food we have 80 different types of food and super fruits 75 different trees
[1:12:01.440 --> 1:12:06.320]  just on our own land here and we grow far more than we can eat so we donate
[1:12:06.320 --> 1:12:10.680]  food to the local community to help people there and to help create good
[1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:16.240]  good relationships between myself a foreigner and the local people and like
[1:12:16.240 --> 1:12:21.160]  you said these these are really good people and Alex this society cannot
[1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:27.000]  collapse because they already live so close to the earth I mean they can do
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:30.200]  without water they can do without electricity they don't have heating and
[1:12:30.200 --> 1:12:33.520]  cooling here because the temperature doesn't require it if the whole world
[1:12:33.520 --> 1:12:36.960]  falls apart there are certain places on this planet where people are going to be
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:43.640]  just almost as usual and this is one of those places amazing the flu you're
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:46.880]  watching this you're actually down in the hemisphere where a lot of this
[1:12:46.880 --> 1:12:52.840]  cranked up we've seen the flu chart from the CDC they say it peaks in a week and
[1:12:52.840 --> 1:12:57.240]  a half very mild but people are being forced to take the regular shot they're
[1:12:57.240 --> 1:13:02.240]  being intimidated they're now starting this week with the regular h1n1 we've
[1:13:02.240 --> 1:13:06.520]  got vaccine trial deaths with other similar vaccines in Europe we have the
[1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:10.960]  very same vaccine makers like Bayer caught knowingly shipping out HIV filled
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:15.440]  shots with hepatitis no one seems to point out why do we trust these people
[1:13:15.440 --> 1:13:20.400]  that they're deploying troops in major cities everywhere they are savagely
[1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:23.720]  attacking peaceful protesters and even going on university campuses saying no
[1:13:23.720 --> 1:13:28.520]  one's allowed outside day or night police dogs attacking I mean it's it's
[1:13:28.520 --> 1:13:32.600]  devastating Mike to see this break down you've also written some great
[1:13:32.600 --> 1:13:36.720]  articles the 10 lies of the flu pandemic you've broken down what's really
[1:13:36.720 --> 1:13:40.640]  happening with the government health care Mike Adams you've got the floor
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:45.040]  all right and and I apologize in advance if I do get disconnected I'll call
[1:13:45.040 --> 1:13:49.280]  right back in because I am talking to you from southern Ecuador and sometimes
[1:13:49.280 --> 1:13:54.320]  it happens in any case the number one thing that I think most Americans need
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:59.160]  to be aware of right now is that even if they never got the vaccine and even if
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:04.200]  they never showed flu symptoms they may already have antibodies for the swine
[1:14:04.200 --> 1:14:08.880]  flu they may have already been exposed and and their immune system did its job
[1:14:08.880 --> 1:14:12.600]  you know the job that that God meant our immune system to do which is to
[1:14:12.600 --> 1:14:18.160]  overcome infectious disease you may be walking around right now immune to
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:22.880]  swine flu and yet at the same time these authorities want everybody to be
[1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:28.080]  injected anyway regardless of your status regardless of what the side effects
[1:14:28.080 --> 1:14:31.920]  might be and without any long-term testing ever being done on any of these
[1:14:31.920 --> 1:14:36.440]  vaccines so this vaccine I agree with your previous guests over the last
[1:14:36.440 --> 1:14:41.360]  several weeks would have said this vaccine is more dangerous than the
[1:14:41.360 --> 1:14:46.200]  pandemic by far let me just interrupt briefly Dr. Monteef made the point from
[1:14:46.200 --> 1:14:50.840]  the CDC's own numbers upwards of 37% of Americans when they get tested who are
[1:14:50.840 --> 1:14:54.840]  healthy already have the antibodies for the H1N1 meaning that it's already
[1:14:54.840 --> 1:14:59.560]  massively in the public and a very weak virus that so why would they and they
[1:14:59.560 --> 1:15:06.720]  still inoculate people who have the antibodies totally pointless yeah yeah
[1:15:06.720 --> 1:15:11.760]  exactly well it comes down to this they use taxpayer dollars to buy all these
[1:15:11.760 --> 1:15:15.080]  vaccines and if they don't find a way to use them they're gonna look pretty
[1:15:15.080 --> 1:15:20.440]  darn stupid so they are gonna push this pandemic regardless of the scientific
[1:15:20.440 --> 1:15:25.080]  basis for it which is really no basis for vaccination at this point and this
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:27.920]  is gonna make sure they use up all these vaccines even if that means
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:32.760]  injecting babies and children and immune compromised people I mean they're just
[1:15:32.760 --> 1:15:36.320]  gonna use them up to justify the decision that they made to buy these
[1:15:36.320 --> 1:15:42.520]  vaccines that's not a medical policy that's politics did you see the Reuters
[1:15:42.520 --> 1:15:46.520]  story two weeks ago where they said oh millions are gonna die of heart attacks
[1:15:46.520 --> 1:15:50.240]  and strokes and autoimmune stuff they're gonna think it's after they take the
[1:15:50.240 --> 1:15:54.240]  shot but it's impossible the shot can't have a bad reaction so they're getting
[1:15:54.240 --> 1:15:57.760]  everybody ready for the bad reactions saying it's a conspiracy it doesn't
[1:15:57.760 --> 1:16:01.920]  exist when their own internal CDC memorandums that were released a month
[1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:08.040]  ago said no get ready for adverse effects yeah this is a call that preemptive
[1:16:08.040 --> 1:16:13.520]  hypnosis of the consumers they're trying to feed people this line to make
[1:16:13.520 --> 1:16:17.720]  them ignore the side effects and discount them as being just coincidence
[1:16:17.720 --> 1:16:21.560]  but we've got a plan to do something about this we're gonna have a website
[1:16:21.560 --> 1:16:25.600]  out there where people can post the side effects that they're experiencing and
[1:16:25.600 --> 1:16:29.240]  we'll be announcing that within a few days so we're gonna get some of this on
[1:16:29.240 --> 1:16:33.640]  the record Alex because the whole medical industry is trying to whitewash
[1:16:33.640 --> 1:16:38.120]  this entire thing they have full immunity they take no responsibility and they
[1:16:38.120 --> 1:16:42.680]  don't value human life well talk about conflict of interest I mean they're the
[1:16:42.680 --> 1:16:45.960]  ones profiting from it running the genocide and then they preemptively
[1:16:45.960 --> 1:16:50.440]  say if you get gillian beret or you get any of these other diseases or you die
[1:16:50.440 --> 1:16:56.440]  or get sick it wasn't the vaccine preemptively right and remember this
[1:16:56.440 --> 1:17:00.600]  this is research that has come out of Canada just in the last two days that
[1:17:00.600 --> 1:17:06.280]  people who get the regular seasonal flu shot may be at an increased risk of
[1:17:06.280 --> 1:17:11.400]  being harmed by this wine flu if they do get exposed to this wine so now we've
[1:17:11.400 --> 1:17:17.040]  got a case where one vaccine is worsening potentially the pandemic and
[1:17:17.040 --> 1:17:20.880]  and yet they're pushing both of these vaccines on everyone of course I say
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:23.800]  don't take any of the vaccines just take care of your immune system and you're
[1:17:23.800 --> 1:17:31.200]  gonna be fine you know it's anecdotal but neighbor kids playing my yard they
[1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:35.280]  all bunch of them got a shot so we can a half ago now two of the four neighbor
[1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:38.920]  kids are sick in bed the last week and a half and their parents can't put two
[1:17:38.920 --> 1:17:44.240]  and two together it's very common Alex if you look at many of the outbreaks of
[1:17:44.240 --> 1:17:49.000]  infectious disease over the last several decades you'll find that that many of the
[1:17:49.000 --> 1:17:53.320]  people who were infected in some cases the vast majority were in fact the very
[1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:58.840]  people who received the vaccination injections I've called vaccines Alex
[1:17:58.840 --> 1:18:03.840]  that the quackery of modern medicine this is the one thing that they cannot
[1:18:03.840 --> 1:18:08.800]  give up they can't tell the truth about vaccines because so much of western
[1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:13.920]  medicine and pharmacology depends on this mythology that chemical intervention
[1:18:13.920 --> 1:18:19.040]  is the solution to your health problems but if not it's it's just a collection
[1:18:19.040 --> 1:18:24.280]  of lies and we are seeing it now very clearly with this swine flu vaccine
[1:18:24.280 --> 1:18:30.440]  amazing continue we're about to go to break but with the talk of force in
[1:18:30.440 --> 1:18:33.400]  occultation is trying to force the medical workers to do it although
[1:18:33.400 --> 1:18:38.760]  obama says don't worry don't have to take it well very clearly we're we're
[1:18:38.760 --> 1:18:41.400]  getting lots of reports from people you know we have thousands of emails
[1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:45.520]  sometimes and healthcare workers are complaining to us that they are being
[1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:49.480]  threatened to be intimidated and they're losing their jobs now because of their
[1:18:49.480 --> 1:18:54.760]  refusals to get the swine flu vaccination and this is happening all
[1:18:54.760 --> 1:18:59.000]  across America so it is being made mandatory in several different ways
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:02.200]  even though they don't oh yeah they're having big protest in New York and New
[1:19:02.200 --> 1:19:06.680]  Jersey tomorrow and it's now mainstream news they're firing people oh yeah they
[1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:10.160]  are yeah they're just gonna kick them right out and the thing is these nurses
[1:19:10.160 --> 1:19:13.560]  they know what they're talking about they can go to their bosses in the
[1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:16.520]  hospitals and they can present documentation that you know I'm a
[1:19:16.520 --> 1:19:20.520]  healthy person I have high vitamin D levels I don't have respiratory problems
[1:19:20.520 --> 1:19:24.440]  I'm not susceptible to swine flu infection and and I'm healthy but it
[1:19:24.440 --> 1:19:28.360]  doesn't matter they say take the injection or take a hike that's what
[1:19:28.360 --> 1:19:34.680]  they're being told right now Alex meanwhile the military propaganda arm
[1:19:34.680 --> 1:19:38.680]  is saying no one has to take it don't listen to the conspiracy theorist just
[1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:43.840]  take the shot of your fired but no one's making you all psych warfare I want to
[1:19:43.840 --> 1:19:47.200]  get the bottom line from Mike Adams the health ranger on what he believes is
[1:19:47.200 --> 1:19:50.560]  really going on here a lot of scientists are saying this is man-made
[1:19:50.560 --> 1:19:53.920]  they're saying they may release something else it's mutated it's more deadly
[1:19:53.920 --> 1:19:57.880]  why do we see such a massive buildup for something that looks so incredibly
[1:19:57.880 --> 1:20:03.800]  mild on the surface stay with us hey everybody this is Steven Baldwin and

[1:24:14.800 --> 1:24:23.760]  but i got wise you're the devil in disguise or as you are you know like
[1:24:23.760 --> 1:24:27.840]  adam's health ranger joining us from Ecuador
[1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:31.280]  it's not even the devil in disguise i mean the history of vaccines the history
[1:24:31.280 --> 1:24:34.480]  of these drug makers the history of us how they're involved in eugenics
[1:24:34.480 --> 1:24:38.720]  not 50 years ago i mean they were but five years ago a year ago
[1:24:38.720 --> 1:24:42.000]  how they kill us on purpose how they do this by design how we're in this
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:46.720]  scientific big pharma dictatorship it's just
[1:24:46.720 --> 1:24:50.480]  incredible uh you go over the 10 big lies of the vaccine
[1:24:50.480 --> 1:24:53.440]  but before we go into that and take calls in the next segment
[1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:56.720]  from your deep study of this and i really respect your wide ranging
[1:24:56.720 --> 1:25:01.040]  you know view and research on this and you're probably the biggest
[1:25:01.040 --> 1:25:04.640]  alternative media person when it comes to just alternative health
[1:25:04.640 --> 1:25:10.400]  and all the experts you talk to what is this whole flu hype really about
[1:25:10.400 --> 1:25:14.160]  well thanks for asking me that question by the way because there is a lot of
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:16.640]  information that comes to me that that i really don't
[1:25:16.640 --> 1:25:20.320]  i don't i can't substantiate well enough to publish but it comes to me from
[1:25:20.320 --> 1:25:23.600]  several different sources so it starts to paint a picture
[1:25:23.600 --> 1:25:28.160]  for example i had a physician visiting me here in ecuador recently
[1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:31.120]  and this position was telling me about the training
[1:25:31.120 --> 1:25:34.880]  that they had just received for how to handle people
[1:25:34.880 --> 1:25:38.640]  who were were refusing to swine flu vaccinations
[1:25:38.640 --> 1:25:43.040]  and this is totally completely congruent
[1:25:43.040 --> 1:25:46.480]  with the reports we're getting from you know certain law enforcement personnel
[1:25:46.480 --> 1:25:50.160]  sheriffs especially who are saying that they're receiving either training or
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:53.440]  instruction on how to deal with a swine flu
[1:25:53.440 --> 1:25:58.560]  vaccine checkpoints and the so-called refuse mix people who people who refuse
[1:25:58.560 --> 1:26:02.160]  the vaccine and that's in the level six literature globally
[1:26:02.160 --> 1:26:05.360]  and a lot of the info we were getting two three weeks ago is now being confirmed
[1:26:05.360 --> 1:26:09.040]  so this is going on yeah oh yeah absolutely and i've heard it
[1:26:09.040 --> 1:26:13.120]  firsthand from people that i know and trust it's not just random bloggers
[1:26:13.120 --> 1:26:15.760]  emailing me things these are people that i've known for many years so
[1:26:15.760 --> 1:26:19.920]  something there's an undercurrent that is definitely happening
[1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:24.160]  now you can't i can't say if it's definitely if it's a
[1:26:24.160 --> 1:26:28.160]  if it's a plan to make these things happen or if it's just a contingency plan
[1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:34.000]  in case these this pandemic or if it's a drill to test military and police to
[1:26:34.000 --> 1:26:38.400]  see if they'll do it oh yeah exactly there's
[1:26:38.400 --> 1:26:41.520]  there's definitely an element of that going on i think
[1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:44.800]  alice i think that these people are listening to your show they're reading
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:48.160]  my website they're watching what the physicians
[1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:51.120]  and the nurses and the healthcare professionals actually
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:54.560]  oh no they let little no they've written about that fox news others have
[1:26:54.560 --> 1:26:58.400]  written about this show particularly i've seen you singled out no they admit
[1:26:58.400 --> 1:27:02.880]  they're monitoring us right now oh yeah it it's all part of the same
[1:27:02.880 --> 1:27:07.120]  the same plan to make sure that they can properly manipulate the population
[1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:10.240]  and that's why you get into that story that you mentioned before the break
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:15.280]  about the preemptive hypnosis of people to discount the swine flu vaccine
[1:27:15.280 --> 1:27:21.200]  side effects but if you ask me what i what's the underlying
[1:27:21.200 --> 1:27:25.520]  purpose of all of this there are two that really come to mind
[1:27:25.520 --> 1:27:29.760]  and one is that vaccines are fantastic at creating
[1:27:29.760 --> 1:27:33.440]  future business for the pharmaceutical companies
[1:27:33.440 --> 1:27:36.960]  because if you vaccinate everybody you're going to get down the road a
[1:27:36.960 --> 1:27:40.080]  certain percentage of people with liver problems
[1:27:40.080 --> 1:27:43.360]  with neurological problems especially and of course
[1:27:43.360 --> 1:27:47.520]  the immune system problems and this means future business for the cancer
[1:27:47.520 --> 1:27:50.080]  industry future business for the transplant
[1:27:50.080 --> 1:27:53.600]  industry which is steeped in all kinds of evil doing that we can't even go
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:56.160]  into but you know what you see where i'm going with
[1:27:56.160 --> 1:28:00.880]  this alex this creates a lot of business and it's all about money
[1:28:00.880 --> 1:28:07.280]  but the second possibility here is about population control and if you
[1:28:07.280 --> 1:28:10.720]  look at the chemicals that are being put into these vaccines
[1:28:10.720 --> 1:28:15.760]  you know the squalene in particular this is a chemical that is associated with
[1:28:15.760 --> 1:28:19.440]  increased infertility and what a what a brilliant clever
[1:28:19.440 --> 1:28:24.480]  evil way to cause widespread infertility just get everybody to sign up for
[1:28:24.480 --> 1:28:30.480]  injection and frying and frying immune systems
[1:28:30.480 --> 1:28:35.520]  absolutely i i think that the medical complex in this country
[1:28:35.520 --> 1:28:41.280]  wants to keep people immune compromised and completely ignorant
[1:28:41.280 --> 1:28:44.880]  of medical reality they don't want people to know about
[1:28:44.880 --> 1:28:49.200]  natural cures for example or all the cures for cancer that exists right now
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:52.880]  all all around the world i've got i've got cures for cancer growing in my
[1:28:52.880 --> 1:28:56.160]  front yard here in ecuador and they're all over south america
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:28:59.040]  and north americans haven't heard of many of these
[1:28:59.040 --> 1:29:02.640]  but they exist and they're being censored and oppressed
[1:29:02.640 --> 1:29:08.160]  because the people in charge want to keep the american people ignorant
[1:29:08.160 --> 1:29:11.920]  well i agree with that it's also about reinforcing the lie that
[1:29:11.920 --> 1:29:15.440]  you've got to take vaccines setting the precedent that you've got to take
[1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:18.880]  vaccines uh it's also as you said a soft kill weapon
[1:29:18.880 --> 1:29:23.360]  like look at how they've increased the vaccinations for hepatitis then suddenly
[1:29:23.360 --> 1:29:27.040]  levels of hepatitis explode off the charts let's come back and talk about
[1:29:27.040 --> 1:29:30.080]  that on the other side with mike adams the health ranger i'm alex

[1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:06.400]  jump in and that's a great opportunity for me but i'm trying to break my habit
[1:37:06.400 --> 1:37:10.000]  of interrupting what is most important people should know about the regular
[1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:14.240]  shot and the h1n one where do you see all this
[1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:19.440]  going and what can we do to get the word out to say no to this
[1:37:19.440 --> 1:37:22.400]  yeah the most important thing people need to know right now
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:26.240]  is that if they're considering a vaccine maybe they're trying to weigh
[1:37:26.240 --> 1:37:29.440]  the the potential upside and the potential downside
[1:37:29.440 --> 1:37:32.640]  they might be doing that from a point of view of believing
[1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:36.640]  that they have been told both sides of the story what they need to know
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:40.640]  is that these drug companies and merc in particular i just wrote an article
[1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:44.880]  about about merc today has a well documented history
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:50.480]  of engaging in the intimidation of doctors and researchers who disagree
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:54.080]  with the safety of the company's products so
[1:37:54.080 --> 1:37:57.680]  the question that i asked in today's article in fact was
[1:37:57.680 --> 1:38:00.800]  are doctors and researchers and health care workers being
[1:38:00.800 --> 1:38:05.760]  intimidated about speaking out against the safety of the vaccines because i
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:09.120]  think that's what's going on in fact i'm sure of it alex
[1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:12.400]  that people need to know that they aren't being given both sides of the
[1:38:12.400 --> 1:38:16.080]  story that these vaccines are not safe and that in fact
[1:38:16.080 --> 1:38:19.280]  they weren't even approved under a system of quote
[1:38:19.280 --> 1:38:23.360]  scientific medicine they were approved under a
[1:38:23.360 --> 1:38:27.840]  a medical dogma a medical tyranny that operates in this country today under
[1:38:27.840 --> 1:38:31.040]  emergency under level six under level six blue pandemic
[1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:35.840]  emergency they did they did it absolutely this isn't scientific
[1:38:35.840 --> 1:38:39.440]  this vaccine isn't based on science it's based on profits
[1:38:39.440 --> 1:38:42.960]  and politics and control it has nothing to do
[1:38:42.960 --> 1:38:49.200]  with medical justification period mike you brought up murk interrupting here
[1:38:49.200 --> 1:38:52.800]  you you brought up murk it was in the abc news australia
[1:38:52.800 --> 1:38:57.040]  headline murk grew up hit list of doctors with quote seek and destroy
[1:38:57.040 --> 1:39:00.880]  missions quote going to where they live and then murk said we just mean we go
[1:39:00.880 --> 1:39:04.560]  after them not that we kill them but a lot of people in the federal court said
[1:39:04.560 --> 1:39:08.160]  now we believe this is hit teams go ahead well yeah they use
[1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:11.520]  those exact terms they said we're going to quote neutralize doctors there was
[1:39:11.520 --> 1:39:15.360]  another email from a murk employee that surfaced in this australian
[1:39:15.360 --> 1:39:19.040]  court case where they said quote uh we're going to go after them where they
[1:39:19.040 --> 1:39:21.840]  live we're going to interfere with the funding of
[1:39:21.840 --> 1:39:26.160]  academic institutions we're going to essentially target and destroy
[1:39:26.160 --> 1:39:29.520]  any person or organization that speaks out against our drugs
[1:39:29.520 --> 1:39:33.200]  this is a drug company whose vaccines have been approved
[1:39:33.200 --> 1:39:36.240]  by the fda to be injected into your babies
[1:39:36.240 --> 1:39:40.320]  we think about that and they brought us Gardasil
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:44.960]  they brought us Gardasil they brought us vioxx remind folks about that
[1:39:44.960 --> 1:39:48.880]  yeah well Gardasil it's the same story in fact i think the Gardasil
[1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:52.800]  propaganda was a trial run for this pandemic propaganda
[1:39:52.800 --> 1:39:57.280]  Gardasil they've managed to get more than half of all teenage girls
[1:39:57.280 --> 1:40:00.960]  in america injected with this Gardasil vaccine which
[1:40:00.960 --> 1:40:04.160]  is once again medically unjustified in my view
[1:40:04.160 --> 1:40:07.600]  and in the view of many many other well educated medical professionals
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:10.560]  and that this vaccine has been linked with all kinds of problems
[1:40:10.560 --> 1:40:15.040]  with people passing out with deaths deaths have been linked with this
[1:40:15.040 --> 1:40:18.720]  neurological problems have been linked with it but it's the same story
[1:40:18.720 --> 1:40:23.040]  as with the swine flu vaccine they say couldn't be us couldn't be the vaccine
[1:40:23.040 --> 1:40:27.440]  don't blame us it must be something else it it's always this disavowing of
[1:40:27.440 --> 1:40:33.600]  responsibility well these are new type of genetically engineered
[1:40:33.600 --> 1:40:37.120]  hybrid viruses they admitted in their own insert during the trials three years
[1:40:37.120 --> 1:40:39.920]  ago as you know but recapping for people
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:43.440]  that it was causing autoimmune disorders that there were deaths linked to it in
[1:40:43.440 --> 1:40:47.280]  the trials now the deaths are mounting and healthy
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:51.040]  13 14-year-old girls take it and their lives are over they die they get
[1:40:51.040 --> 1:40:54.240]  paralyzed and we know that merc went to governor
[1:40:54.240 --> 1:40:57.840]  rick perry to get him to quote make it mandatory or on the list of mandatory
[1:40:57.840 --> 1:41:02.400]  shots it's to be in school so that vaccine damage fund federally
[1:41:02.400 --> 1:41:06.080]  would kick in this is one cold-blooded uh
[1:41:06.080 --> 1:41:11.120]  plan that they're engaged in this is a very powerful corporation with a lot of
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:14.640]  strong political ties including with governor rick perry
[1:41:14.640 --> 1:41:18.400]  there in texas but many other ties at the national level i mean this this
[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:23.680]  this company rules the medical world and my concern with that alex is that
[1:41:23.680 --> 1:41:26.960]  they're doing so purely based on profit and politics
[1:41:26.960 --> 1:41:31.760]  and not based on science i mean the the scientific method has been thrown out
[1:41:31.760 --> 1:41:35.040]  the window when it comes to these vaccines
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:38.000]  this whole germ theory has been turned on its head and
[1:41:38.000 --> 1:41:45.040]  and used exploited as a way to dominate the the health beliefs of
[1:41:45.040 --> 1:41:49.200]  the american citizens now people people don't realize that they need to take
[1:41:49.200 --> 1:41:52.560]  responsibility for their own health they need to eat better
[1:41:52.560 --> 1:41:56.160]  they need to get some sunshine and vitamin b they need to
[1:41:56.160 --> 1:42:00.000]  you know stop using so many chemicals in personal care products
[1:42:00.000 --> 1:42:03.520]  if they do those things they're going to be well protected
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:06.880]  against this pandemic or or any pandemic really
[1:42:06.880 --> 1:42:10.880]  but absolutely the medical system wants chemical intervention
[1:42:10.880 --> 1:42:14.560]  but that's what they keep driving at well now the medical system is telling
[1:42:14.560 --> 1:42:18.080]  doctors don't tell people there's any protection but tamaflu
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:21.040]  or h1n1 shot don't tell people you need
[1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:24.800]  natural vitamin d from the sun 30 minutes of sun every few days
[1:42:24.800 --> 1:42:30.480]  direct sun don't tell people vitamin c don't tell people fish oil don't tell
[1:42:30.480 --> 1:42:34.320]  people colloidal silver compounds even though the studies show it's excellent
[1:42:34.320 --> 1:42:38.240]  they're saying you're now not allowed to tell people
[1:42:38.240 --> 1:42:42.720]  well exactly this is the enforced health illiteracy
[1:42:42.720 --> 1:42:47.040]  of the american people i mean it really i almost hate to invoke this imagery but
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:51.040]  it goes back to the enslavement of people in America
[1:42:51.040 --> 1:42:54.240]  and how do you keep people enslaved is you keep them illiterate
[1:42:54.240 --> 1:42:58.080]  and that's what the FDA is doing that's what the FTC is doing
[1:42:58.080 --> 1:43:01.680]  with the way that they attack and go after these companies that try to
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:06.080]  tell the truth online about the benefits of their herbal products
[1:43:06.080 --> 1:43:09.920]  or their nutritional products or their superfoods they are being attacked
[1:43:09.920 --> 1:43:14.000]  intimidated arrested they're having their inventory confiscated
[1:43:14.000 --> 1:43:18.240]  i had i had one of these guys a founder of one of these companies visited me
[1:43:18.240 --> 1:43:22.480]  in ecuador the things he told me i'm i would have thought he came out
[1:43:22.480 --> 1:43:27.520]  he was being oppressed in nazi germany but no he came from the united states of
[1:43:27.520 --> 1:43:31.920]  america barely got out of the country with his life with his freedom
[1:43:31.920 --> 1:43:36.160]  and now he refuses to go back because he's selling natural products
[1:43:36.160 --> 1:43:40.160]  well the people are right now the people perish for lack of knowledge and
[1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:42.160]  certainly there's a lot of quacks out there but
[1:43:42.160 --> 1:43:45.200]  there's more quackery in the in the in the major
[1:43:45.200 --> 1:43:48.880]  md medical system the drug companies taking over medicine
[1:43:48.880 --> 1:43:51.760]  even getting rid of classical western medicine and bringing in this
[1:43:51.760 --> 1:43:57.760]  pharmacia medicine uh but uh i've talked a lot of other medical
[1:43:57.760 --> 1:44:01.840]  doctors and they say that the tyranny is really expanding when you can't tell
[1:44:01.840 --> 1:44:08.080]  people get lots of rest in sunshine when when when the cdc says only drugs
[1:44:08.080 --> 1:44:12.880]  only shots it's just such a crime
[1:44:12.880 --> 1:44:15.920]  yeah and there are very few companies and individuals
[1:44:15.920 --> 1:44:21.760]  are willing to to stand up to the ftc there's one company it's actually a
[1:44:21.760 --> 1:44:25.280]  church organization daniel chapter one and i've written about them
[1:44:25.280 --> 1:44:29.360]  extensively and i know you've spoken with them but they are standing up to
[1:44:29.360 --> 1:44:33.520]  the ftc and pulling the bluff of these these federal tyrants
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:37.200]  that are trying to censor this information and keep the american
[1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:39.840]  people uninformed about natural health so
[1:44:39.840 --> 1:44:44.480]  daniel chapter one could be you know the david that stands up to the goliath in
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:46.720]  washington so we're watching that situation
[1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:51.840]  very carefully absolutely i want to take some phone calls now
[1:44:51.840 --> 1:44:56.400]  any other key points you haven't added sir uh no let's go right to the calls
[1:44:56.400 --> 1:44:59.440]  and and we'll handle any questions that you'd like
[1:44:59.440 --> 1:45:03.920]  yeah they'll be all over the map uh louis in texas you're on the air go ahead
[1:45:03.920 --> 1:45:09.680]  hey can you hear me good yes i can uh yeah i got uh three quick points on a
[1:45:09.680 --> 1:45:12.800]  question for the doctor um he's not a doctor he's a he's a health
[1:45:12.800 --> 1:45:18.160]  researcher oh okay yeah right well uh
[1:45:18.160 --> 1:45:21.840]  you know i was alive during the vietnam war and a good portion of the
[1:45:21.840 --> 1:45:26.160]  um resistance came from the university
[1:45:26.160 --> 1:45:30.400]  and i mean this thing that we witnessed over here at the g20 i mean i don't
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:35.280]  pop anybody's cork you know and uh really a lot of people are saying how
[1:45:35.280 --> 1:45:38.880]  do we let the police come up and and and even go into dorms
[1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:42.480]  and attack people and and shoot kids on their front porches
[1:45:42.480 --> 1:45:46.080]  playing ball or in their front yards with sound cannons
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:50.960]  uh this is just outrageous go ahead well i'll tell you i'll tell you uh what i'm
[1:45:50.960 --> 1:45:54.640]  calling for is a nationwide even worldwide
[1:45:54.640 --> 1:45:59.120]  demonstrations on all the college campuses you know against this new world
[1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:02.480]  order against you know especially here you know against the free you know
[1:46:02.480 --> 1:46:05.840]  either trying to give us these free speed zones and all this stuff
[1:46:05.840 --> 1:46:08.960]  i mean uh you don't want to get out there and get yourself killed like kent
[1:46:08.960 --> 1:46:12.720]  state but i mean you know i mean those things that we can do you know we got
[1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:16.160]  to stand up i mean these students i mean if i was a student in another
[1:46:16.160 --> 1:46:19.680]  university i saw what they did to those guys over at pittsburgh there
[1:46:19.680 --> 1:46:23.920]  i'd be like man you know how fast can i get in these people's faces you know
[1:46:23.920 --> 1:46:27.520]  we'll see what's happening is if they set the precedent to be able to beat
[1:46:27.520 --> 1:46:31.200]  people up use police dogs on old women in neighborhoods
[1:46:31.200 --> 1:46:34.240]  then they can chill free speech and that's what this is all about
[1:46:34.240 --> 1:46:37.200]  telling people if you protest you'll be put on a terror list
[1:46:37.200 --> 1:46:40.640]  they are the terrorists the secret police terrorists doing that
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:44.000]  and and because they know that the changes to the dollar the changes to our
[1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:46.800]  way of life the tyranny people are going to rebel
[1:46:46.800 --> 1:46:52.160]  so they're trying to cow us and make us submit right now these are psyops
[1:46:52.160 --> 1:46:55.440]  but but more importantly than just protesting and i think that's important
[1:46:55.440 --> 1:46:59.760]  is calling into talk radio starting website starting flaring campaigns
[1:46:59.760 --> 1:47:02.240]  because they can't stop you coming out of the middle of nowhere putting up
[1:47:02.240 --> 1:47:06.320]  flyers with different issues that's what our joker poster contest was about
[1:47:06.320 --> 1:47:09.120]  and i'm gonna announce the new the contest tomorrow i promise the limits
[1:47:09.120 --> 1:47:11.680]  when i've just been so far behind got behind with fall the republic but
[1:47:11.680 --> 1:47:15.600]  i'm gonna do that tomorrow the issue here is that
[1:47:15.600 --> 1:47:18.960]  we've done this to show people the power of just getting active i appreciate
[1:47:18.960 --> 1:47:22.160]  your call what are other things we can do
[1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:26.320]  rick uh mike adams in your point to really rattle the cage of the
[1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:29.520]  establishment and have the people's voice be heard
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:34.000]  or or do you see my point about what'll happen if we just let this chilling
[1:47:34.000 --> 1:47:38.080]  effect take place oh absolutely the the ruling
[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:41.760]  class right now is ruling by fear and intimidation and
[1:47:41.760 --> 1:47:45.040]  what you know more and more people are waking up i want to point this out
[1:47:45.040 --> 1:47:48.080]  about the vaccine you know a recent poll showed
[1:47:48.080 --> 1:47:53.040]  that 60 percent of parents are refusing to give their children the vaccine
[1:47:53.040 --> 1:47:57.040]  that's a huge statistic alex that means that people like you and i are
[1:47:57.040 --> 1:48:01.280]  winning this information campaign against all the
[1:48:01.280 --> 1:48:05.280]  the multi-million dollars worth of public relations and advertising
[1:48:05.280 --> 1:48:08.080]  and and promotional pushes by the drug companies
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:11.120]  more than half of the parents still won't vaccinate their children against
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:15.200]  twice but that's a victory and we need more victories like that
[1:48:15.200 --> 1:48:19.040]  because the truth will prevail here all we got to do
[1:48:19.040 --> 1:48:23.520]  is keep on getting the truth out there help to awaken other people around us
[1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:27.760]  turn them on to the truth and we we will ultimately
[1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:31.120]  be victorious in this i believe but it's it's going to be a difficult process
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:36.000]  and by the way now is the time as the tyranny comes in as everything we
[1:48:36.000 --> 1:48:40.400]  talked about beforehand unfolds we have amazing credibility right now
[1:48:40.400 --> 1:48:44.080]  we've got to reach out to everybody and speak out now because we can white
[1:48:44.080 --> 1:48:46.800]  people up 10 years ago but not in these numbers
[1:48:46.800 --> 1:48:50.480]  people are ready to hear the truth the establishment there
[1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:53.520]  is there trying to lead them around into more tyranny right now
[1:48:53.520 --> 1:48:56.800]  we've got to be there to say no there's an alternative
[1:48:56.800 --> 1:49:00.720]  that's exactly right you know the american people are smart people they
[1:49:00.720 --> 1:49:04.240]  can figure it out if they have access to the right information
[1:49:04.240 --> 1:49:07.520]  now the the people in power are trying to keep
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:11.360]  the americans blind but fortunately websites like yours
[1:49:11.360 --> 1:49:15.200]  prison planet many others out there and the information that you are getting
[1:49:15.200 --> 1:49:19.840]  out there this is working so keep up keep doing a
[1:49:19.840 --> 1:49:23.520]  thank thank goodness for what you're doing there alex
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:26.320]  well we're gonna go to bright come back and take some final calls thank god for
[1:49:26.320 --> 1:49:31.040]  what you're doing your sites are rivaling ours in size which excites
[1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:34.000]  me so many other people in alternative media
[1:49:34.000 --> 1:49:37.280]  think we're competing with each other my show's been successful
[1:49:37.280 --> 1:49:41.120]  because i bring the little guys on the big guys everybody in between
[1:49:41.120 --> 1:49:45.280]  i just want freedom for my family i understand i'm in a race against the
[1:49:45.280 --> 1:49:48.720]  globalist and i'm not doing this for fame or fortune
[1:49:48.720 --> 1:49:52.400]  we certainly try to fund ourselves and be comfortable and and have some assets
[1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:55.440]  so we can defend ourselves if something comes up
[1:49:55.440 --> 1:49:58.880]  we need to be strong and powerful so we're trying to become strong and
[1:49:58.880 --> 1:50:02.640]  powerful and challenge the system that's why i've
[1:50:02.640 --> 1:50:06.240]  noticed cia and an fbi funded and it's come out with some of these
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:11.040]  grips that they are fbi funded try to create racial division try to
[1:50:11.040 --> 1:50:15.280]  make the liberty movement be about race or religion they try to divide us
[1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:19.680]  they constantly fight with each other uh they do this not just out of jealousy
[1:50:19.680 --> 1:50:22.320]  or greed but really to divide us that's why they
[1:50:22.320 --> 1:50:25.760]  attack ron paul that's why they attack me that's why they attack you
[1:50:25.760 --> 1:50:29.040]  the establishment knows they're discredited they can't attack us from
[1:50:29.040 --> 1:50:31.840]  their high purchase they have to attack us from
[1:50:31.840 --> 1:50:36.960]  renomab false grass roots and that's because we're effective and it's
[1:50:36.960 --> 1:50:41.520]  scaring the system so i take those attacks as a blessing
[1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:45.520]  yep well said alex keep let's let's keep up the good work here

[1:54:09.600 --> 1:54:12.720]  they put out seven years ago saying cell phones
[1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:18.400]  farmers almanac maps are all signed you're a terrorist go ahead
[1:54:18.400 --> 1:54:20.960]  if the police pull you over go ahead and put you in a terror
[1:54:20.960 --> 1:54:25.360]  database for life no firearms no liberty no due process i mean
[1:54:25.360 --> 1:54:28.480]  mike adams is that not the ultimate tyranny where they just put you on
[1:54:28.480 --> 1:54:32.400]  secret list for no reason and what two years ago
[1:54:32.400 --> 1:54:35.760]  one of the head federal marshals in denver went public and said
[1:54:35.760 --> 1:54:40.720]  we have a quota of innocent people to put on terror list for life
[1:54:40.720 --> 1:54:45.040]  and they put a million two hundred thousand americans on it we know of
[1:54:45.040 --> 1:54:48.560]  since a year ago when they made the list secret
[1:54:48.560 --> 1:54:52.080]  yeah this is this is one of the the processes of tyranny
[1:54:52.080 --> 1:54:56.160]  is putting people on these secret lists outside of the normal
[1:54:56.160 --> 1:55:00.240]  process of of law right a due process i mean
[1:55:00.240 --> 1:55:03.760]  this is the way to circumvent the constitution and they are
[1:55:03.760 --> 1:55:07.280]  really clever at this they're really good at this and i think it's going to get
[1:55:07.280 --> 1:55:09.440]  a lot worse alex before it gets better
[1:55:09.440 --> 1:55:13.840]  we something has to to happen here the american people have got to
[1:55:13.840 --> 1:55:16.480]  to rally again and to stand up for their freedoms
[1:55:16.480 --> 1:55:20.240]  and their rights and to protect the u.s constitution which i thought was a
[1:55:20.240 --> 1:55:23.040]  valid document you know when i was growing up in school and i was being
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:25.360]  taught american history gee i thought that thing
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:30.320]  still applied only as an adult do you learn that it's been circumvented
[1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:35.360]  well i don't think people realize the process of tyranny once an elite
[1:55:35.360 --> 1:55:38.160]  decides to be ruthless and go all the way
[1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:41.920]  and they believe human life is not just a cheap but a negative
[1:55:41.920 --> 1:55:45.040]  once they make that decision the sky is the limit
[1:55:45.040 --> 1:55:48.480]  and it's now the sky is the limit we're going to keep you another 20 minutes and
[1:55:48.480 --> 1:55:51.440]  take calls we appreciate you joining us partner chris
[1:55:51.440 --> 1:55:56.880]  tanya mary and d bob and others but it sounded like when i mentioned
[1:55:56.880 --> 1:56:01.040]  the concerted attacks that are clearly funded against anybody exposing the
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:03.360]  corruption ron paul and making people take
[1:56:03.360 --> 1:56:05.840]  flu shots ron paul and raising people's taxes
[1:56:05.840 --> 1:56:09.680]  you're not making people take flu shots you're not sending SWAT teams to people's
[1:56:09.680 --> 1:56:14.080]  homes but all this alternative media attacks anybody who's real
[1:56:14.080 --> 1:56:17.920]  i notice we all get attacked by these concerted operations mainstream and
[1:56:17.920 --> 1:56:20.880]  alternative and as much as i'd like to believe it's just
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:23.680]  jealous people more and more it's being proven it's government
[1:56:23.680 --> 1:56:27.840]  and that's their counter is to try to throw up such a screen of arguing and
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:31.600]  fighting and infighting that nobody can ever get together
[1:56:31.600 --> 1:56:35.760]  and i think when you see somebody being attacked and lied about that's the seal
[1:56:35.760 --> 1:56:40.480]  that they're good and can be trusted well there's no question we we've been
[1:56:40.480 --> 1:56:43.680]  subjected to attacks that were organized and funded by
[1:56:43.680 --> 1:56:47.760]  we think pharmaceutical companies or or their front companies and
[1:56:47.760 --> 1:56:51.120]  this has just been going on for years we you know we we hardly even really talk
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:55.200]  about it anymore it's just a routine part of being a publisher of
[1:56:55.200 --> 1:56:59.040]  true information i mean you know the only way to not be harassed
[1:56:59.040 --> 1:57:05.440]  in our our system today is to lie on behalf of the corporation
[1:57:05.440 --> 1:57:09.920]  if you if you go out and you say nice happy things about the drug company
[1:57:09.920 --> 1:57:13.840]  and about the oil companies and about all the politicians who are lying to us
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:17.920]  and spending it's into a complete bankruptcy if you say happy things
[1:57:17.920 --> 1:57:22.000]  about those people you'll be left alone you won't be harassed by anybody
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:25.200]  it's only when you go out and start asking questions like
[1:57:25.200 --> 1:57:29.680]  like what ron paul does every single day you know ron paul is being attacked
[1:57:29.680 --> 1:57:33.840]  precisely because he is effective and that's the same reason that you and i
[1:57:33.840 --> 1:57:37.440]  are being attacked alex well and also it's a military tactic
[1:57:37.440 --> 1:57:41.200]  whenever they deny they're trying to forcibly inoculate nurses
[1:57:41.200 --> 1:57:44.800]  and they are or they lie and say there's no plan to get rid of the dollar as
[1:57:44.800 --> 1:57:48.080]  they openly have debates about doing it it's a denial
[1:57:48.080 --> 1:57:51.520]  so that we just debate whether it exists or not instead of having a real debate
[1:57:51.520 --> 1:57:54.800]  about whether we want it or not or if it's legal or lawful
[1:57:54.800 --> 1:57:58.400]  and it's the same thing by making it about alex jones being bad or ron paul
[1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:01.360]  being bad or mike adams being bad or dr stanmont
[1:58:01.360 --> 1:58:04.720]  teeth being bad then even our defenders spend their time
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:08.400]  defending us instead of going out and warning new
[1:58:08.400 --> 1:58:12.160]  people so that's why i always tell my listeners don't defend me
[1:58:12.160 --> 1:58:15.280]  go out and reach new people and warn them about fluoride in the water
[1:58:15.280 --> 1:58:18.720]  warn them about jingamow food warn them about vaccines
[1:58:18.720 --> 1:58:21.680]  warn them about the attack on iran and lying about
[1:58:21.680 --> 1:58:25.760]  uh their processing centers for uranium and how that's a hoax
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:29.920]  do not defend me my family doesn't get saved if you defend me
[1:58:29.920 --> 1:58:34.160]  then wake everybody up spend your time doing that and then all of us can be
[1:58:34.160 --> 1:58:38.000]  saved from this tyranny back in one minute with mike adams and your phone
[1:58:38.000 --> 1:58:42.560]  calls i'm alex jones
[1:58:42.560 --> 1:58:50.480]  thank you for listening to gcn be sure to visit gcnlive.com today
[1:58:50.480 --> 1:58:54.160]  hello friends this is alex jones and i want each of you to ask yourself this
[1:58:54.160 --> 1:58:56.800]  question do you really know what's in your tap water
[1:58:56.800 --> 1:59:00.480]  in a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor
[1:59:00.480 --> 1:59:04.560]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal
[1:59:04.560 --> 1:59:07.840]  drinking water many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer
[1:59:07.840 --> 1:59:10.880]  reproductive immune and developmental system diseases
[1:59:10.880 --> 1:59:14.640]  now what are you going to do about it the acola blue atmospheric water
[1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:18.080]  generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your

[2:00:39.200 --> 2:00:42.480]  with mike adams hey how you guys doing today
[2:00:42.480 --> 2:00:48.320]  good okay um i don't know if you guys got this but i have a document from the
[2:00:48.320 --> 2:00:51.280]  federal government that i called off of google
[2:00:51.280 --> 2:00:55.120]  it is the international swine flu conference they had a month ago
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:00:59.760]  yeah we covered it we we originally broke that and we had reporters
[2:00:59.760 --> 2:01:03.200]  uh who were there on the show like wane madsen but that
[2:01:03.200 --> 2:01:07.360]  that was a force quarantines how to deal with dead bodies lockdowns of cities
[2:01:07.360 --> 2:01:12.240]  mike adams you want to comment on that uh no you're exactly right that was a
[2:01:12.240 --> 2:01:15.520]  very important piece of breaking news that wasn't supposed to break that was
[2:01:15.520 --> 2:01:19.840]  supposed to be kept you know uh behind the curtain but it was exposed
[2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:24.240]  but you ever notice now caller notice that when you tell people about that
[2:01:24.240 --> 2:01:27.760]  they look at they look at you like you're crazy they don't believe it's real
[2:01:27.760 --> 2:01:32.640]  have you experienced that oh man people i have my own family calling me a nut
[2:01:32.640 --> 2:01:35.520]  job or or one of these people that are getting
[2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:38.640]  too into it that i'm going to go nuts and i'm like hey i'm just trying to find
[2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:43.680]  out what's going on around me exactly well that's because they know
[2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:47.200]  they should be going nuts about this tyranny and they know things are out of
[2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:49.440]  control and so they're telling you what they're
[2:01:49.440 --> 2:01:54.560]  afraid of about themselves i'm sorry go ahead one last uh well
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:01:58.560]  one couple things uh they had 15 sessions and one of them here in the
[2:01:58.560 --> 2:02:01.920]  breakout session one uh one of their bullets is conducting
[2:02:01.920 --> 2:02:06.000]  morgue operations so they were obviously planning on mass casualties and mass
[2:02:06.000 --> 2:02:08.880]  deaths no they've got quarantines lockdowns forced
[2:02:08.880 --> 2:02:13.120]  inoculations in there mike adam you know your comments on that document
[2:02:13.120 --> 2:02:15.600]  well when i read that document you know what the first thing that came to my
[2:02:15.600 --> 2:02:19.760]  mind was is that the ultimate plan for health care reform
[2:02:19.760 --> 2:02:23.120]  is to reduce the population by 80 percent because then
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:26.720]  health care becomes affordable did you see the cover of newsweek
[2:02:26.720 --> 2:02:29.840]  or where it said the case for killing granny
[2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:33.200]  no no i haven't seen that one in fact if i guys pull up the newsweek
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:37.680]  covered the case for killing granny i can't find the actual article the actual
[2:02:37.680 --> 2:02:43.760]  keep going mike well again if you if you this country is growing
[2:02:43.760 --> 2:02:48.320]  going broke treating sickness and disease and at some point
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:51.760]  it's not unreasonable to think that somebody at high levels would say you
[2:02:51.760 --> 2:02:55.680]  know what the only way we can afford health care in this country
[2:02:55.680 --> 2:03:00.160]  is if we have fewer people to care for and my goodness that
[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:04.240]  that that whole uh uh session that went on their training
[2:03:04.240 --> 2:03:07.600]  that for body bags and training for quarantines and training for mass
[2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:11.440]  deaths i mean that that was the really concerning stuff
[2:03:11.440 --> 2:03:14.640]  and it you know just to get you thinking hard about
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:18.240]  what's really being planned for the new i agree but but i mean see their psych
[2:03:18.240 --> 2:03:22.000]  warfare program they come out in the bill is health care rationing in the
[2:03:22.000 --> 2:03:24.560]  bill the guy that wrote it tom dashill writes a book
[2:03:24.560 --> 2:03:27.440]  saying yeah if you're above 60 need eye surgery you're not going to get it they
[2:03:27.440 --> 2:03:31.600]  do ration it in europe uh but there's no mention of that then
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:34.480]  simultaneously they have all these news articles
[2:03:34.480 --> 2:03:38.000]  saying there's too many people we've got a reduced world population having kids
[2:03:38.000 --> 2:03:42.080]  is bad for your carbon footprint and by the way we need to kill granny
[2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:46.320]  the case for killing granny there's the newsweek headline online
[2:03:46.320 --> 2:03:49.440]  from newsweek and then they sit there and say
[2:03:49.440 --> 2:03:53.280]  we're going to kill you but then it doesn't exist and then your neighbor
[2:03:53.280 --> 2:03:56.240]  even if you show your neighbor newsweek they go you're insane that's a fake
[2:03:56.240 --> 2:04:00.560]  newsweek no i'm not kidding you know this health
[2:04:00.560 --> 2:04:04.240]  care reform debate right now is completely congruent with these kinds
[2:04:04.240 --> 2:04:08.720]  of evil philosophies you know it's absolutely true
[2:04:08.720 --> 2:04:12.160]  now that if this health care reform bill gets passed
[2:04:12.160 --> 2:04:15.920]  and if you don't agree to sign up for health care insurance and pay
[2:04:15.920 --> 2:04:20.320]  what is it $1,900 a year or so for an individual or $13,000
[2:04:20.320 --> 2:04:24.880]  for a family they will be able to arrest you imprison you for one year
[2:04:24.880 --> 2:04:30.720]  and the irs can find you $25,000 i mean hold on hold on i'm sorry mike i'm
[2:04:30.720 --> 2:04:33.360]  sorry mike we have breaking news i'm going to cover this with you when we
[2:04:33.360 --> 2:04:36.080]  come back it always comes out in hindsight
[2:04:36.080 --> 2:04:40.720]  i look at this video they're definitely cops age of provocateurs documented at
[2:04:40.720 --> 2:04:44.320]  g20 during march info wars dot com exclusive
[2:04:44.320 --> 2:04:47.120]  article with the video right now you can look at them they're

[2:04:52.240 --> 2:04:56.560]  uh they oh my god oh my god that's why they attack luke they didn't like it
[2:04:56.560 --> 2:04:59.680]  that he was exposing them man these people are evil

[2:08:04.400 --> 2:08:09.280]  alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:08:10.000 --> 2:08:13.680]  ladies and gentlemen the video is flooding in as people have a chance to
[2:08:13.680 --> 2:08:17.440]  analyze it we're analyzing ours finding similar things
[2:08:17.440 --> 2:08:21.040]  you know i have a limited crew they just got back saturday we've already posted a
[2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:23.760]  lot of videos this video is from another activist
[2:08:23.760 --> 2:08:26.800]  clearly police officers breaking people's cameras
[2:08:26.800 --> 2:08:30.640]  trying to stir up trouble i can't play the audio because there's so much cussing
[2:08:30.640 --> 2:08:35.200]  but these are just two of the three and big huge cops they put their biggest
[2:08:35.200 --> 2:08:38.560]  cops in to pose as anarchists and we're going to try to match this up with
[2:08:38.560 --> 2:08:43.280]  other video of big scrapping guys who will throw stuff at police so the
[2:08:43.280 --> 2:08:49.120]  police have a pretext to then fire and attack the general crowd
[2:08:49.120 --> 2:08:52.640]  and uh i remember
[2:08:52.640 --> 2:08:58.560]  pardon me yeah breaking breaking demonstrators cameras absolutely that's
[2:08:58.560 --> 2:09:01.840]  that's in the video we can't play it because there's so much cussing but
[2:09:01.840 --> 2:09:07.120]  look at these cops i mean look at these guys now we caught them in denver
[2:09:07.120 --> 2:09:11.040]  last year mainstream news denver post had lined police caught attacking their
[2:09:11.040 --> 2:09:15.200]  own police we caught them in canada at the spp meeting last year
[2:09:15.200 --> 2:09:19.440]  they were caught by the bbc admitted it in england and they killed a guy beat
[2:09:19.440 --> 2:09:22.880]  him to death uh these guys need to be criminally charged
[2:09:22.880 --> 2:09:26.560]  we need to find out who they are but it's i mean that they put these big giant
[2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:31.040]  cops in mike adams your comment on agent provocateurs
[2:09:31.040 --> 2:09:34.800]  this is a preview of things to come alex and great work on your pardon and the
[2:09:34.800 --> 2:09:38.320]  contributors who are sending this in i can't wait to look at this myself
[2:09:38.320 --> 2:09:42.720]  but this is this is what's going to be happening in more cities across the us
[2:09:42.720 --> 2:09:46.640]  and this is a test to see how people react to see whether they can
[2:09:46.640 --> 2:09:51.600]  they can do this covertly and be exposed so the fact that you are exposing them
[2:09:51.600 --> 2:09:55.120]  it's probably going to help save lives down the road because it's going to
[2:09:55.120 --> 2:09:58.080]  help suppress that kind of tactic from being used
[2:09:58.080 --> 2:10:02.000]  excessively i mean they're going to try it anyway but the thing is we keep
[2:10:02.000 --> 2:10:04.560]  exposing them and other people do and then the royal
[2:10:04.560 --> 2:10:06.720]  mount of police admit it the denver police admit it
[2:10:06.720 --> 2:10:10.320]  and no one gets in trouble that's why lucerdowski was there
[2:10:10.320 --> 2:10:13.920]  and rob doer there were others saying don't be violent you'll have a couple
[2:10:13.920 --> 2:10:18.800]  thousand people or in this case a couple hundred you'll have 15 people led by cops
[2:10:18.800 --> 2:10:23.040]  they'll yell and scream and tell luc shut up when he calls out against violence
[2:10:23.040 --> 2:10:27.520]  and then it's cops i mean how evil are these police
[2:10:27.520 --> 2:10:31.280]  what we've got to do is get some long-range cameras going from people
[2:10:31.280 --> 2:10:35.520]  who are away from the immediate fray and who are not in the fight
[2:10:35.520 --> 2:10:38.720]  get that happen in greece land that happened in greece this year in fact
[2:10:38.720 --> 2:10:42.240]  pull up greek tv admit agent provocateurs
[2:10:42.240 --> 2:10:46.160]  uniform police directing regular cops busting out windows
[2:10:46.160 --> 2:10:50.400]  at another global meeting to then blame it on the general protesters sorry go
[2:10:50.400 --> 2:10:53.200]  ahead yeah no you're exactly right i mean this
[2:10:53.200 --> 2:10:56.080]  this is like a local law enforcement false flag operation
[2:10:56.080 --> 2:10:58.720]  and they're going to keep doing it for as long as they can get away with it
[2:10:58.720 --> 2:11:02.080]  but in the video that you're seeing right now alex can you
[2:11:02.080 --> 2:11:05.440]  can you make out the faces very clearly of those responsible
[2:11:05.440 --> 2:11:09.040]  no they're wearing masks but it's big strapping cops
[2:11:09.040 --> 2:11:12.560]  uh i mean they stick out like a sore thumb it's always the same i mean it's
[2:11:12.560 --> 2:11:17.200]  big guys 230 240 pounds they always dress the same
[2:11:17.200 --> 2:11:21.200]  ballcaps and and their face covered and uh
[2:11:21.200 --> 2:11:24.480]  they're breaking people's cameras they're starting fights they're just
[2:11:24.480 --> 2:11:28.400]  absolute scum well disburg has been turned into a police
[2:11:28.400 --> 2:11:33.360]  state i mean the city is it was a fortress and this is a sign of things

[2:11:43.120 --> 2:11:46.160]  to do a big report on it because it's not enough to just show this i'm going to
[2:11:46.160 --> 2:11:49.120]  show the denver stuff and everything else so people forget

[2:12:06.480 --> 2:12:10.960]  and um right in this document it says it is um
[2:12:10.960 --> 2:12:16.560]  that flu viran has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or mutagenic potential
[2:12:16.560 --> 2:12:21.360]  or for impairment of fertility so else you just saying all along that they're
[2:12:21.360 --> 2:12:24.720]  putting sterile incident it says right here you know we are this can make you
[2:12:24.720 --> 2:12:27.200]  fertile or infer oh yeah look look i mean it's come out with
[2:12:27.200 --> 2:12:31.360]  the ied's and the vaccines and they always know they design it and they
[2:12:31.360 --> 2:12:33.920]  have now now explain what the flu viran is and this
[2:12:33.920 --> 2:12:38.160]  andrew lukin two that they're adding mike adams but ma'am
[2:12:38.160 --> 2:12:41.200]  i need to go to wall greens every time i pull up an internet site it's wall
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:44.800]  greens ads for the flu i need to get their insert but will you
[2:12:44.800 --> 2:12:50.320]  scan that and email it uh to uh writers at info wars dot com or we'll put you
[2:12:50.320 --> 2:12:54.000]  on hold and give you a secret email will you scan that and send it to us
[2:12:54.000 --> 2:12:57.280]  um yeah i'd refer to facts that that's fine and there's a lot of other
[2:12:57.280 --> 2:13:01.200]  information in here too they say they've been putting h1 in h1 n1 in the
[2:13:01.200 --> 2:13:05.280]  vaccine since 1977 and they have a long list of side
[2:13:05.280 --> 2:13:08.880]  effects that have been reported this is a very informative uh okay read it to us
[2:13:08.880 --> 2:13:11.280]  read it to us because i knew all this was in there
[2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:14.400]  and i guess i haven't thought big genius because i'm not
[2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:17.600]  took you to go out and get the insert i mean they admit in their literature
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:21.120]  online they're doing this but mike were you aware of those statements on the
[2:13:21.120 --> 2:13:25.200]  norvitas uh statement yeah absolutely don't
[2:13:25.200 --> 2:13:28.080]  remember those are the ones that are required by federal law there are
[2:13:28.080 --> 2:13:31.760]  there's a lot of information that's not required that they're withholding
[2:13:31.760 --> 2:13:35.520]  so as she reads the list keep in mind of what you're not hearing too
[2:13:35.520 --> 2:13:38.800]  yeah thanks for holding so long to tell us this
[2:13:38.800 --> 2:13:45.440]  um Marianne or what color is this okay tanya they just changed my list and
[2:13:45.440 --> 2:13:50.080]  it's skid it erased your name tanya and georgia uh tanya recap i'm
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:53.920]  going to sit back so is uh mike adams read the cover
[2:13:53.920 --> 2:13:57.040]  sheet what it says and and read us those parts
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:13:59.760]  well it's it's really really long so i'm just going to go through a few points
[2:13:59.760 --> 2:14:03.040]  that i was highlighting for you um the first thing that i noticed is that it
[2:14:03.040 --> 2:14:06.640]  says fluverin has not been evaluated for carcinogenic or
[2:14:06.640 --> 2:14:10.000]  mutagenic potential or for impairment of fertility
[2:14:10.000 --> 2:14:12.880]  and then later on or it's talking about who shouldn't should not get the shot
[2:14:12.880 --> 2:14:17.120]  it says nobody under the age of four and it also says that it is also not known
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:20.320]  whether fluverin can cause fetal harm when administered to a
[2:14:20.320 --> 2:14:24.080]  pregnant woman or can affect a reproductive capacity
[2:14:24.080 --> 2:14:28.000]  so and remember that it it's the expected mothers that are
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:31.360]  one of the groups being targeted for those virus by the way i just wanted to
[2:14:31.360 --> 2:14:35.200]  right and this is regular this is just the regular seasonal flu which hasn't
[2:14:35.200 --> 2:14:38.240]  been as controversial so some of the pregnant women might not even be as
[2:14:38.240 --> 2:14:42.640]  scared of this one and it also says in here that um whoever's giving the
[2:14:42.640 --> 2:14:45.440]  vaccine is supposed to tell the person that they're giving the shot to the
[2:14:45.440 --> 2:14:48.160]  benefits and the risks now i think if they told somebody
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:50.720]  hey this can make you sterile you know this has uh
[2:14:50.720 --> 2:14:54.320]  their marisol in it which it also says it does that you know people might not take
[2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:56.320]  it and i don't think they're telling people that
[2:14:56.320 --> 2:14:59.760]  how did you get the insert you asked for it at walgreens yeah and let me tell
[2:14:59.760 --> 2:15:03.120]  you it's funny i walked into walgreens and i said what kind of uh
[2:15:03.120 --> 2:15:06.160]  shot are you giving what company is it from and they didn't know and i said
[2:15:06.160 --> 2:15:08.960]  well do you have an insert and they said what and i go you know like a little
[2:15:08.960 --> 2:15:12.400]  paper that comes in with your shipment so she goes back and she's looking i'm
[2:15:12.400 --> 2:15:14.640]  assuming this is the pharmacist there was two women back there
[2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:17.200]  they're looking around they come back with this piece of paper they pulled out
[2:15:17.200 --> 2:15:20.640]  of the bottom of the box of vials all folded up very tiny
[2:15:20.640 --> 2:15:23.760]  unfold it right in front of me and say here let me start you know i'm looking
[2:15:23.760 --> 2:15:26.400]  at it and it's really long and i said can i just take this with me and they said
[2:15:26.400 --> 2:15:28.880]  oh yeah sure take it like they had no interest in it
[2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:32.960]  well this is important and i've read that this stuff's in there
[2:15:32.960 --> 2:15:36.480]  but but it's another thing to actually have the insert i'm going to give you
[2:15:36.480 --> 2:15:39.760]  our facts the problem is on those tiny you know
[2:15:39.760 --> 2:15:43.040]  regular size sheet of paper they fold it up tiny to go in the vial
[2:15:43.040 --> 2:15:46.720]  and it's tiny tiny wording i don't know that'll fax but you can try
[2:15:46.720 --> 2:15:51.680]  eight six oh you blew it up it's eight six six eight nine four
[2:15:51.680 --> 2:15:57.520]  seventeen sixty seven that's eight six six eight nine four seventeen sixty seven
[2:15:57.520 --> 2:16:01.440]  uh will you go ahead and fax that's to us as soon as possible
[2:16:01.440 --> 2:16:05.920]  is there no way that that because if you blew it up can you scan it
[2:16:05.920 --> 2:16:09.760]  and and email it to watson because people need to see that
[2:16:09.760 --> 2:16:13.120]  that it talks about attacking your fertility and mutagens
[2:16:13.120 --> 2:16:17.280]  and cancer because the german news admits that german scientists are admitting
[2:16:17.280 --> 2:16:19.600]  that but it's important we could save a lot of
[2:16:19.600 --> 2:16:23.360]  live showing people this eight six six eight nine four seventeen sixty seven
[2:16:23.360 --> 2:16:26.000]  did you get that yeah i got it i'm gonna i'm gonna leave my
[2:16:26.000 --> 2:16:29.120]  house right now and go fax it to you but i had one other question for mike
[2:16:29.120 --> 2:16:32.640]  also in this uh insert it says that it's very important that you shake
[2:16:32.640 --> 2:16:36.720]  the vial in between each dosage and i'm wondering if if they don't shake it does
[2:16:36.720 --> 2:16:39.600]  that mean that you can get like an even higher amount of mercury than what
[2:16:39.600 --> 2:16:43.440]  they're saying yes absolutely and this this is one of
[2:16:43.440 --> 2:16:47.120]  the reasons why we got to be very careful if you even get a vaccine
[2:16:47.120 --> 2:16:50.560]  of where you get it because many of the people administering these vaccines
[2:16:50.560 --> 2:16:53.120]  especially in these retail outlets they are
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:56.800]  properly shaking up the vaccine which means you could get a concentration
[2:16:56.800 --> 2:17:02.480]  of the thimerosol or other chemicals that's up to 200 times higher than what
[2:17:02.480 --> 2:17:06.080]  it's supposed to be so your baby could get the one shot
[2:17:06.080 --> 2:17:10.160]  that's 200 times more toxic than the next baby that they actually shook the vial
[2:17:10.160 --> 2:17:13.200]  for and that's one of the reasons why vaccines are so dangerous
[2:17:13.200 --> 2:17:16.480]  that people given these shots are not following the rules and they probably
[2:17:16.480 --> 2:17:20.160]  didn't even read the insert that you read no i don't think they did i don't
[2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:22.160]  think they did i'm going to leave right now and go ahead and fax this team let
[2:17:22.160 --> 2:17:24.560]  you move on but i just wanted to make sure that you were aware this was coming
[2:17:24.560 --> 2:17:28.560]  to you you know the reason that they include that language in that in that
[2:17:28.560 --> 2:17:33.200]  insert alex is so that if infertility problems become
[2:17:33.200 --> 2:17:37.120]  widespread they can say well we warned you
[2:17:37.120 --> 2:17:40.880]  you know they can just disavow any responsibility but then meanwhile the
[2:17:40.880 --> 2:17:44.480]  nightly news says it doesn't sterilize you
[2:17:44.480 --> 2:17:49.360]  sure the white house science are says he wants to sterilize you
[2:17:49.360 --> 2:17:53.280]  through vaccines in your water but that's okay
[2:17:53.280 --> 2:17:56.800]  and then you read the insert oh it's going to might sterilize you well that's
[2:17:56.800 --> 2:18:00.320]  okay you know the government's good people
[2:18:00.320 --> 2:18:03.680]  these are good people we ought to you know be sterilized
[2:18:03.680 --> 2:18:09.840]  uh... you know i had i had a reporter from a mainstream network news
[2:18:09.840 --> 2:18:12.800]  organization call me maybe two weeks ago
[2:18:12.800 --> 2:18:16.400]  wanted to interview me about about swine flu vaccine obviously was looking for
[2:18:16.400 --> 2:18:20.640]  you know an alternative viewpoint he swore to me up and down
[2:18:20.640 --> 2:18:24.480]  that he had been told by the drug companies themselves that there was no
[2:18:24.480 --> 2:18:28.240]  thimerosal used in any of the swine flu vaccine
[2:18:28.240 --> 2:18:32.160]  and i i tried to educate this reporter i said no you're wrong
[2:18:32.160 --> 2:18:35.440]  there's thimerosal in there and he said no there isn't not
[2:18:35.440 --> 2:18:39.200]  it's not being used and to this day that network which i don't want to name
[2:18:39.200 --> 2:18:43.360]  but they've been reporting uh stories on the swine flu vaccine
[2:18:43.360 --> 2:18:47.280]  and claiming there's no thimerosal in it even though i can pull up a hundred
[2:18:47.280 --> 2:18:52.000]  releases from the medical companies admitting they put a higher dose of the
[2:18:52.000 --> 2:18:58.880]  thimerosal in this one yeah it's you know what has happened to the skepticism
[2:18:58.880 --> 2:19:03.120]  and just the the common sense of our mainstream journalists these days
[2:19:03.120 --> 2:19:07.120]  or when they get caught lying it's like oh you lied to me that's good
[2:19:07.120 --> 2:19:10.160]  i would be mad at you if you didn't lie to me it's it's like it's
[2:19:10.160 --> 2:19:14.320]  cute and funny oh bear you knowingly gave me aides in the shot oh thank you it's
[2:19:14.320 --> 2:19:18.560]  like bears trusted they like to murder

[2:24:32.000 --> 2:24:36.080]  officers attempt to infiltrate a march against police brutality
[2:24:36.080 --> 2:24:41.360]  at the university of Pittsburgh but fail miserably due to their
[2:24:41.360 --> 2:24:46.160]  horrendous disguise attempts during the march one of them breaks the
[2:24:46.160 --> 2:24:49.520]  photographer's camera this is just one example of a larger pattern
[2:24:49.520 --> 2:24:52.560]  of attempts to silence the media during the g20 protest
[2:24:52.560 --> 2:24:56.000]  and if you would have dare broke a cops camera they charge you with assault with
[2:24:56.000 --> 2:24:59.120]  a deadly weapon or something but it's okay for them to beat up women and use
[2:24:59.120 --> 2:25:04.080]  police dogs and break the law and smash your camera
[2:25:04.080 --> 2:25:08.080]  because they work for a lawless criminal corporate takeover and they love the
[2:25:08.080 --> 2:25:11.760]  vaccines they get shot full of they love their kids being retarded
[2:25:11.760 --> 2:25:14.720]  they love the tyranny they love heaven bankruptcy
[2:25:14.720 --> 2:25:17.920]  they love it that's why they have the highest suicide rates highest rates of
[2:25:17.920 --> 2:25:21.760]  drug use they're unhappy because they work for the dark side
[2:25:21.760 --> 2:25:25.520]  i'm not saying all police but certainly the police they shipped in from miami
[2:25:25.520 --> 2:25:29.200]  david county and the board of patrol they shipped in the national guard
[2:25:29.200 --> 2:25:33.920]  these were unamerican pieces of trash and that video
[2:25:33.920 --> 2:25:37.120]  is up on info wars dot com we'll roll some of that in the background without
[2:25:37.120 --> 2:25:40.880]  the audio because of all the cussing for people
[2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:45.440]  as folks watch at prison planet dot tv but let's go to
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:50.080]  mary an in maryland mary an you're on the air
[2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:56.560]  alex hi hi there um listen first i wanted to tell you that uh i really
[2:25:56.560 --> 2:26:02.240]  appreciate all your work and i do pass on to my friends um and family
[2:26:02.240 --> 2:26:05.600]  but i wanted to talk to you about a couple things that are going on in
[2:26:05.600 --> 2:26:10.160]  maryland um i was a teacher for 10 years and every year
[2:26:10.160 --> 2:26:16.720]  the regular flu shot was offered to us for free on uh several
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:20.000]  specific dates at the beginning of the school year
[2:26:20.000 --> 2:26:24.640]  and you know there was a lot of pressure from your peers to get this shot
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:28.720]  i never got the shot but um you know people would be like
[2:26:28.720 --> 2:26:32.800]  you're going to get sick blah blah blah well there's something going on at the
[2:26:32.800 --> 2:26:37.040]  university of maryland right now i'm not sure if you know that but
[2:26:37.040 --> 2:26:43.760]  it has been quote unquote rumored that 557 cases of
[2:26:43.760 --> 2:26:48.400]  swine flu are going on since classes began
[2:26:48.400 --> 2:26:54.720]  and the students are actually um pressuring each other to go and get the
[2:26:54.720 --> 2:26:57.680]  swine flu yeah it's all mind control no i have seen
[2:26:57.680 --> 2:27:02.880]  that at other big universities one in washington state at 2000 cases
[2:27:02.880 --> 2:27:06.160]  and a lot of times it's even fake announcements they're just doing it
[2:27:06.160 --> 2:27:10.000]  as a psi op to test forcing everyone to stampede
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:13.520]  and that's why little kids come to my house and they go look i got the shot
[2:27:13.520 --> 2:27:16.560]  have you had the shot and my little kids are asking me now
[2:27:16.560 --> 2:27:19.360]  why aren't we getting shots and i said you don't want them honey they're bad
[2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:23.200]  for and they go but i want one the neighbor kids got them
[2:27:23.200 --> 2:27:26.400]  so now they've got kids from not wanting shots to thinking
[2:27:26.400 --> 2:27:30.320]  oh it's a prize i get but you read the inserts you know it
[2:27:30.320 --> 2:27:34.400]  sterilizes you but that's okay they told you so i know but see
[2:27:34.400 --> 2:27:39.040]  this is like really super weird this is totally
[2:27:39.040 --> 2:27:42.640]  going along with everything you talk about because 1984
[2:27:42.640 --> 2:27:46.160]  yes people who do not get the shot have to wear
[2:27:46.160 --> 2:27:52.320]  a face mask so it's obvious to other people that they haven't gotten the shot
[2:27:52.320 --> 2:27:55.680]  yeah it's all part of hysteria it's the new it's part of being classified
[2:27:55.680 --> 2:27:59.120]  wearing a yellow star being in a terror database
[2:27:59.120 --> 2:28:03.680]  it's all about the new medical tyranny of just like thx1138 when he's helping
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:05.760]  the kid put the injector back on his arm
[2:28:05.760 --> 2:28:08.960]  oh you've had your 20 shots this week you're of the lord
[2:28:08.960 --> 2:28:12.960]  you're of the government g you know obama loves the little children
[2:28:12.960 --> 2:28:16.000]  red yellow black and white they are equal in our leader's side
[2:28:16.000 --> 2:28:19.120]  it's only you see you're starting to understand now
[2:28:19.120 --> 2:28:22.160]  yes they're making people wear these at universities and
[2:28:22.160 --> 2:28:26.560]  at police departments and there's no law they just make you do it
[2:28:26.560 --> 2:28:31.040]  and uh when you pay to go to college you pay to go be brainwashed and taught
[2:28:31.040 --> 2:28:33.760]  how to worship government that's it basically
[2:28:33.760 --> 2:28:37.760]  oh i mean and i went to i've been through graduate school at john poppins
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:41.600]  it's happening there and um so you're seeing those people need to go shoot
[2:28:41.600 --> 2:28:45.840]  video of this yeah well unfortunately i had to stop
[2:28:45.840 --> 2:28:50.720]  teaching because i'm disabled now but uh they're also at the university of
[2:28:50.720 --> 2:28:56.560]  maryland medical center saying that young children need to be given
[2:28:56.560 --> 2:29:03.120]  two doses yes wine flu vaccine and two or three
[2:29:03.120 --> 2:29:07.440]  two or three see they said four to give people who that's a lot they said oh
[2:29:07.440 --> 2:29:11.760]  it's only two now and people went oh yeah i don't worry there won't be any
[2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:14.560]  more pain for the children there won't be any more high
[2:29:14.560 --> 2:29:18.320]  intelligence or frustration you'll just learn how to be dead
[2:29:18.320 --> 2:29:22.160]  take your shots come on the government's good
[2:29:22.160 --> 2:29:28.320]  but i do have one question for you and that is uh regarding a vera chip i
[2:29:28.320 --> 2:29:32.320]  read an article a very long time ago that it was so small that it could be
[2:29:32.320 --> 2:29:40.160]  injected through a hypodermic needle and i'm wondering if this is part of that

[2:34:49.040 --> 2:34:54.480]  here it is most people still today think that all
[2:34:54.480 --> 2:34:59.760]  entertainment to do with movies drama is therefore nothing more than their
[2:34:59.760 --> 2:35:02.480]  entertainment and never ever was that case
[2:35:02.480 --> 2:35:06.160]  throughout history social engineers have refined techniques
[2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:10.160]  designed to control large populations bringing entertainment to thousands of
[2:35:10.160 --> 2:35:14.400]  people right in the comfort of our own home you're actually
[2:35:14.400 --> 2:35:18.800]  in an outfit states being completely downloaded with new ideas a cult of
[2:35:18.800 --> 2:35:22.320]  personality can be manufactured to influence the masses
[2:35:22.320 --> 2:35:26.080]  nobody will question what he's doing they'll be so preoccupied
[2:35:26.080 --> 2:35:30.000]  with where he is or what he's wearing yes we can
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:34.880]  the idea of making him into a celebrity eventually he said that they will expect
[2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:37.920]  the media to do all their thinking and reasoning for them
[2:35:37.920 --> 2:35:41.440]  and that's happened today the scientific dictatorship
[2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:46.400]  understands what makes human beings tick and they're using it against us
[2:35:46.400 --> 2:35:49.600]  these cells are scanned by a stream of electrons
[2:35:49.600 --> 2:35:52.960]  completing 30 pictures a second it's hard for people
[2:35:52.960 --> 2:35:56.000]  like that to take a serious interest in what their
[2:35:56.000 --> 2:36:00.480]  elected officials are doing they've been programmed it's obama's role to front
[2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:02.480]  for the international banking syndicate
[2:36:02.480 --> 2:36:05.920]  barack obama is a puppet of the new world order
[2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:09.120]  is this some sort of new world order the new world order that is emerging
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:13.280]  for the first time in history we really have this new form of an empire
[2:36:13.280 --> 2:36:17.360]  the average man and woman is in a trance they get home from work
[2:36:17.360 --> 2:36:21.040]  they don't even talk to their children they turn the television on
[2:36:21.040 --> 2:36:26.480]  and they let those corporate messages set the agenda in their lives you got
[2:36:26.480 --> 2:36:30.000]  time to watch baseball you got time to entertain yourself
[2:36:30.000 --> 2:36:35.440]  but a knowledgeable public we're losing kill your television or at least turn it
[2:36:35.440 --> 2:36:38.480]  off a few hours a day the children aren't even playing
[2:36:38.480 --> 2:36:41.840]  in your front yards anymore we don't want to live
[2:36:41.840 --> 2:36:45.520]  under a world government of the corporations
[2:36:45.520 --> 2:36:50.400]  by the corporations and for the corporations
[2:36:50.400 --> 2:36:53.840]  fall of the republic
[2:36:53.840 --> 2:37:00.640]  volume one the presidency of barack obama obama is the latest version of 21st
[2:37:00.640 --> 2:37:04.720]  century mass mind control available on dvd
[2:37:04.720 --> 2:37:09.440]  at info wars dot com and online in prison planet dot tv
[2:37:09.440 --> 2:37:13.760]  october 21st 2009
[2:37:15.280 --> 2:37:18.800]  so there is the third trailer fourth coming out next week in the fifth
[2:37:18.800 --> 2:37:22.480]  the day before it comes out we got some special sneak peeks to
[2:37:22.480 --> 2:37:26.960]  for folks just at prison planet dot tv for the balance of the radio show of a
[2:37:26.960 --> 2:37:30.800]  quick economic uh coverage the last five minutes
[2:37:30.800 --> 2:37:35.040]  is uh alan watt joining us from canada
[2:37:35.040 --> 2:37:38.640]  alan so much is happening they're imploding the dollar
[2:37:38.640 --> 2:37:42.240]  they're bringing in world government they're openly saying no babysitting no
[2:37:42.240 --> 2:37:44.240]  selling watermelons on the side of the road
[2:37:44.240 --> 2:37:47.760]  we're going to give you a hundred thousand dollar fines for garage sales
[2:37:47.760 --> 2:37:53.360]  the same plans in europe in asia in the us are being implemented same names
[2:37:53.360 --> 2:37:57.360]  open announcement of world government there's no more debating it this is the
[2:37:57.360 --> 2:38:00.880]  true emergence i want to go over all of this with you
[2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:05.120]  today but before we get into that what is most important right now
[2:38:05.120 --> 2:38:10.080]  in the mind of alan watt in your deep reflection and analysis as you cut
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:13.200]  through the matrix uh what's what's key that's developing
[2:38:13.200 --> 2:38:17.520]  right now that that alan watt thinks we should all know about
[2:38:17.520 --> 2:38:21.200]  i think you should know what the new world order really is
[2:38:21.200 --> 2:38:25.440]  uh it's um it's a non-democratic system
[2:38:25.440 --> 2:38:29.040]  a world to be ruled by experts and professionals
[2:38:29.040 --> 2:38:33.040]  from all different sciences including all the social sciences
[2:38:33.040 --> 2:38:37.440]  and they go under the term of world peace and that sounds nice and positive
[2:38:37.440 --> 2:38:40.480]  most people but when you break down in their own
[2:38:40.480 --> 2:38:43.440]  writings from their own writings what they mean
[2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:49.600]  by world peace it literally is um a form of totalitarianism from birth
[2:38:49.600 --> 2:38:53.600]  to grave uh to do with uh in fact they want to
[2:38:53.600 --> 2:38:57.520]  separate the children completely from parents so they wouldn't be contaminated
[2:38:57.520 --> 2:39:03.120]  with old-fashioned values and ideas but they're found with scientific indoctrination
[2:39:03.120 --> 2:39:06.640]  kindergarten onwards at any parental inputs
[2:39:06.640 --> 2:39:09.840]  is made null and void and so they all they've pretty well reached that stage
[2:39:09.840 --> 2:39:12.880]  they can literally program uh the generations every
[2:39:12.880 --> 2:39:16.800]  within every intake every year of kindergarten
[2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:20.720]  upgrade incrementally for what they will experience in their lifetime
[2:39:20.720 --> 2:39:23.280]  and they'll accept that which they experience because they've been taught at
[2:39:23.280 --> 2:39:27.600]  school as coming uh so what you're looking at really
[2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:31.520]  the totalitarian world system a depopulation plan
[2:39:31.520 --> 2:39:35.520]  as at the top of it too uh the unfit as they call them
[2:39:35.520 --> 2:39:39.760]  in a post-industrial era remember to all the scientists across the world now and
[2:39:39.760 --> 2:39:43.280]  all the professions believe in evolution it's taught right off the bat
[2:39:43.280 --> 2:39:46.880]  they believe in Darwinian evolution survival of the fittest
[2:39:46.880 --> 2:39:49.920]  they believe that we're the old man all the old types that used to work in
[2:39:49.920 --> 2:39:53.840]  factories uh the blue collar workers are now obsolete
[2:39:53.840 --> 2:39:57.680]  with the emergence of science and robots and genetic technology
[2:39:57.680 --> 2:40:01.680]  they can create new types of better servants and not as many as they have
[2:40:01.680 --> 2:40:05.440]  now all of this is coming down the pipe as we see
[2:40:05.440 --> 2:40:09.200]  even the move as you say to stop neighbors from looking after your child
[2:40:09.200 --> 2:40:11.840]  for a couple hours when they run off for some groceries
[2:40:11.840 --> 2:40:16.480]  is forbidden across the board in all the countries at the same time as you say
[2:40:16.480 --> 2:40:20.800]  and that is also to stop contamination uh and bonding
[2:40:20.800 --> 2:40:25.360]  to other people in your little locality with old-fashioned diabetes
[2:40:25.360 --> 2:40:29.840]  it's okay to put them into a recommended state approved daycare place for a day
[2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:34.000]  because they get the correct kind of induction and simultaneously Europe in
[2:40:34.000 --> 2:40:37.760]  the u.s and england and canada announced they want year-round school
[2:40:37.760 --> 2:40:42.320]  and the internal documents 20 years ago said to break up the families entirely
[2:40:42.320 --> 2:40:45.520]  they've got the men and women working overtime so they can't spend time with
[2:40:45.520 --> 2:40:49.360]  their kids and then if you want to use the neighbor
[2:40:49.360 --> 2:40:53.120]  in fact it even said in england bbc two groups of police officers
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:57.200]  aren't allowed to watch their own kids and the thing was wow even the godlike
[2:40:57.200 --> 2:41:02.000]  police aren't allowed to watch their their kids that's correct and now 20
[2:41:02.000 --> 2:41:06.000]  thousand homes in england that they have cameras watching the kids that they go
[2:41:06.000 --> 2:41:08.640]  to bed on time eat what they're supposed to this is
[2:41:08.640 --> 2:41:13.280]  Orwell yes and instead that's a pilot project for the rest of the country
[2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:17.040]  and whatever happens in britain eventually very rapidly actually
[2:41:17.040 --> 2:41:20.160]  is introduced across the british commonwealth and we're still a commonwealth
[2:41:20.160 --> 2:41:24.880]  we're still basically a subsidiary of britain and and then the u.s picks up
[2:41:24.880 --> 2:41:28.320]  very quickly too everything's working together because we're already
[2:41:28.320 --> 2:41:31.920]  under a global system we have been for a long time
[2:41:31.920 --> 2:41:38.000]  and before even the war uh started on iraq uh the first one
[2:41:38.000 --> 2:41:43.040]  gulf war one uh where we fed on the news that we're all global global global
[2:41:43.040 --> 2:41:46.000]  we went back to being national again where they wanted recruits for the
[2:41:46.000 --> 2:41:50.800]  military they've kept that up for face value but in reality they've
[2:41:50.800 --> 2:41:54.880]  really rolled ahead with the globalism and every law really that comes down
[2:41:54.880 --> 2:41:58.800]  to every nation comes from one of the departments of the united nations is
[2:41:58.800 --> 2:42:02.000]  signed into treaty automatically and all the country and we're going to speak
[2:42:02.000 --> 2:42:06.480]  more about that but since you mentioned the military notice how
[2:42:06.480 --> 2:42:11.920]  in march of last year in the u.s in england and in canada but also in
[2:42:11.920 --> 2:42:16.160]  ireland and scotland simultaneously because i'm just
[2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:20.160]  like you do scanning all the western media also
[2:42:20.160 --> 2:42:26.080]  asian media that's in english simultaneously on the same day they
[2:42:26.080 --> 2:42:30.080]  deployed troops in downtown cities and said oh they're just helping with drunk
[2:42:30.080 --> 2:42:34.560]  drivers helping with checkpoints and now it's an and then they go oh yes it's
[2:42:34.560 --> 2:42:38.560]  for terrorists and for gun owners so right as they
[2:42:38.560 --> 2:42:42.880]  implode the economy they deploy the troops worldwide and then admit it's
[2:42:42.880 --> 2:42:45.920]  global i mean it's all a private corporate
[2:42:45.920 --> 2:42:51.280]  borough deploying this now coming after our farms and ranches our children
[2:42:51.280 --> 2:42:55.760]  any form of independence yes but they deleted the plan a long time ago when
[2:42:55.760 --> 2:42:59.280]  they set up the league of nations the forerunner of the united nations
[2:42:59.280 --> 2:43:04.400]  and in their own charter they said eventually they ban all private property
[2:43:04.400 --> 2:43:08.480]  they'd also have to eradicate farming because farming was too important to left
[2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:12.160]  to farmers big corporations would would run
[2:43:12.160 --> 2:43:16.480]  the farming of the world we're simply going through a pre-planned agenda
[2:43:16.480 --> 2:43:20.080]  but now with the century of change and that's the key to it this is the
[2:43:20.080 --> 2:43:23.680]  century of change that all academia was talking about
[2:43:23.680 --> 2:43:29.040]  for for 50 odd years uh weren't into the century of change it's not democratic
[2:43:29.040 --> 2:43:33.520]  we see now the rise of this entity this legal entity of
[2:43:33.520 --> 2:43:38.400]  of the EU economic union as a sovereign new
[2:43:38.400 --> 2:43:42.560]  soviet a bigger soviet system than the old soviet system
[2:43:42.560 --> 2:43:47.520]  non-democratic that admits in its own publications and in the major media
[2:43:47.520 --> 2:43:51.120]  that all the decisions are made by an executive branch at the top
[2:43:51.120 --> 2:43:55.360]  with secret committees and the politicians have no inputs into the
[2:43:55.360 --> 2:43:59.440]  lawmaking all you can do is complain and that's it
[2:43:59.440 --> 2:44:04.000]  this is not a post-democratic world written and
[2:44:04.000 --> 2:44:08.160]  when you read the writings of the big players in the last 50 to 100 years
[2:44:08.160 --> 2:44:11.840]  involved in these international movements like the Huxleys
[2:44:11.840 --> 2:44:15.120]  like both the Huxleys inside julian and albu Huxley
[2:44:15.120 --> 2:44:18.560]  and Russell and others they they say straight out
[2:44:18.560 --> 2:44:23.760]  that this world will be run by a form of scientific dictatorship
[2:44:23.760 --> 2:44:27.440]  where the public will simply obey that that's the whole key to everything now
[2:44:27.440 --> 2:44:30.960]  is obey you're an animal we can retrain you like any
[2:44:30.960 --> 2:44:36.720]  animal the Pavlovian concept and your job is to serve the world state
[2:44:36.720 --> 2:44:40.000]  now now alan i want to bring up a key point here and i want you to speak to
[2:44:40.000 --> 2:44:45.040]  this studying their operations at the heart of it
[2:44:45.040 --> 2:44:49.200]  they are social Darwinists they're saying if we kill a billion people
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:54.400]  since we are in the position of power that means genetically we got the power
[2:44:54.400 --> 2:44:57.680]  because we were the best and so we're helping the earth
[2:44:57.680 --> 2:45:02.320]  by killing you they're testing soft kill weapons sterilization
[2:45:02.320 --> 2:45:05.520]  as the white house science are spoke about i want to go over this
[2:45:05.520 --> 2:45:10.560]  with you today but more than that they get the general public to adopt the
[2:45:10.560 --> 2:45:13.840]  eugenical eugenics ideas but they don't even consciously
[2:45:13.840 --> 2:45:16.720]  know why of yeah humans are a parasite yeah
[2:45:16.720 --> 2:45:20.320]  there's too many of us we don't have art and literature and spacecraft and
[2:45:20.320 --> 2:45:23.440]  you know we can't do incredible things which we actually are the
[2:45:23.440 --> 2:45:28.400]  an incredible species a wonderful species a self-aware species
[2:45:28.400 --> 2:45:33.440]  uh you know but but the elites believe their gods they believe
[2:45:33.440 --> 2:45:37.200]  they're wonderful and and and they want to control the future
[2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:41.520]  and so they only sell the public on lowering their survival instinct
[2:45:41.520 --> 2:45:44.640]  so they will accept and make it a religious sacrament
[2:45:44.640 --> 2:45:48.560]  dying for their carbon footprint or not having children
[2:45:48.560 --> 2:45:55.120]  or or being sacrificed to the earth and so this idea that man is crud man is
[2:45:55.120 --> 2:45:58.720]  crap they sell this and sell this and say you have no rights
[2:45:58.720 --> 2:46:02.800]  you're just an animal it's a mind game it's it's a huckster scam
[2:46:02.800 --> 2:46:06.320]  to say you can make no decisions you're just programmed
[2:46:06.320 --> 2:46:10.000]  but then oh the elites have to have their rights they have to have their body
[2:46:10.000 --> 2:46:13.440]  guards oh they're free they they they write all this sick
[2:46:13.440 --> 2:46:17.280]  dark nihilistic poetry about how they control everything and
[2:46:17.280 --> 2:46:21.040]  they'll destroy everything if they want to so so inherently
[2:46:21.040 --> 2:46:24.240]  these are very sick evil control freaks
[2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:28.240]  there's no doubt about it at all it's a religion with them
[2:46:28.240 --> 2:46:31.600]  it's a complete it fulfills all the criteria of the religion
[2:46:31.600 --> 2:46:36.320]  belief system and superior genetic uh
[2:46:36.320 --> 2:46:39.200]  basically a hereditary genetic stalk because they believe in
[2:46:39.200 --> 2:46:43.280]  that they're from it um they believe that we are the leftover junk genes at the
[2:46:43.280 --> 2:46:46.240]  bottom otherwise we would be up at the top that's the simple
[2:46:46.240 --> 2:46:50.720]  reasoning that they have and they believe in power
[2:46:50.720 --> 2:46:54.800]  is the main key to survival therefore they're the ones at the top
[2:46:54.800 --> 2:46:58.640]  with the total power and they do plan to exercise that they are
[2:46:58.640 --> 2:47:02.160]  exercising it now i just went through stuff that was released
[2:47:02.160 --> 2:47:06.080]  from the world health organization from some of its meetings but they've never
[2:47:06.080 --> 2:47:10.160]  disposed to the public before and they not and they admit during their own
[2:47:10.160 --> 2:47:14.400]  discussion their internal debates that that's most of these vaccines all of
[2:47:14.400 --> 2:47:18.560]  the vaccines in fact uh the vast bulk of the contaminants in them
[2:47:18.560 --> 2:47:21.680]  including genetic contaminants and viruses
[2:47:21.680 --> 2:47:25.360]  are unknown to them sometimes 90 percent of every
[2:47:25.360 --> 2:47:29.760]  inoculation and poly polyo still is unknown to them don't know they don't
[2:47:29.760 --> 2:47:32.880]  know the effects on the body except with the new
[2:47:32.880 --> 2:47:36.080]  adjuvants they're using for this upcoming swine flu shot
[2:47:36.080 --> 2:47:39.840]  they do know that they're using rather than chicken eggs they're using
[2:47:39.840 --> 2:47:44.080]  cancer viruses they admit that their own writings they're using cancer viruses
[2:47:44.080 --> 2:47:49.280]  for the simple reason that cancer viruses are almost indestructible
[2:47:49.280 --> 2:47:53.280]  so it will stay in your body forever supposedly to protect your body
[2:47:53.280 --> 2:47:57.440]  at the same time it might just give you cancer this is incredible science
[2:47:57.440 --> 2:48:00.880]  in other words they know what they're doing they're taking the population
[2:48:00.880 --> 2:48:04.960]  down not just at a drastic step all at once
[2:48:04.960 --> 2:48:08.000]  but depending on your shot and your physiology
[2:48:08.000 --> 2:48:11.760]  it will all start dying off much much faster over the next few years now now
[2:48:11.760 --> 2:48:15.440]  allen stop this is this is this is mind-blowing we're on the same page
[2:48:15.440 --> 2:48:18.960]  this is admitted in hundreds of government textbooks like eco science
[2:48:18.960 --> 2:48:22.480]  for the white house science are we now have bought over 10 books he authored
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:26.320]  all saying the same sickening stuff about how they would do this inject us with
[2:48:26.320 --> 2:48:29.280]  cancer viruses that would trigger as soon as our
[2:48:29.280 --> 2:48:33.120]  hormone levels lowered in men and women between 45 and 65
[2:48:33.120 --> 2:48:37.520]  we now see that happening the boldness what do you call the boldness of where
[2:48:37.520 --> 2:48:40.880]  they openly say they're killing us where they openly admit
[2:48:40.880 --> 2:48:45.520]  the first 10 million people in canada and the u.s to get the nasal live flu
[2:48:45.520 --> 2:48:48.400]  virus they admit it's going to mutate it and
[2:48:48.400 --> 2:48:52.720]  spread it yes this is so so in plain view
[2:48:52.720 --> 2:48:56.240]  they admit it has cancer viruses in the major german and british news
[2:48:56.240 --> 2:48:59.840]  we're shooting cancer viruses live into our nostrils
[2:48:59.840 --> 2:49:03.840]  they admit the garter cells killing the girls and mutating its own inventor came
[2:49:03.840 --> 2:49:06.640]  out and said don't take it i'm sure they'll kill her or something
[2:49:06.640 --> 2:49:12.720]  the point is is that what do you call that because i see
[2:49:22.960 --> 2:49:26.960]  old health organization that they're doing a massive campaign
[2:49:26.960 --> 2:49:30.720]  to train the public train the public to accept that
[2:49:30.720 --> 2:49:35.120]  masses of people die all the time from strokes and heart attacks and cancers
[2:49:35.120 --> 2:49:38.960]  so don't relate it to the vaccine that you're getting this is the present
[2:49:38.960 --> 2:49:43.680]  propaganda blitz that's out right now so they're treating the victim to accept
[2:49:43.680 --> 2:49:47.680]  his own death and put down to coincidences it's
[2:49:47.680 --> 2:49:51.360]  amazing that they understand what they can do to the public because they've
[2:49:51.360 --> 2:49:55.040]  lied so many times in the past they know the formulas and the techniques and then
[2:49:55.040 --> 2:49:59.440]  they know how we respond we if there's one percent of credibility in their
[2:49:59.440 --> 2:50:02.480]  arguments the public will want to believe them
[2:50:02.480 --> 2:50:06.400]  rather than cross the line and see if these guys are killing us
[2:50:06.400 --> 2:50:11.600]  because because the average person just like in harden montana when i caught
[2:50:11.600 --> 2:50:15.200]  when our listeners caught the con artist felon now admitted running a giant
[2:50:15.200 --> 2:50:18.080]  takeover of the town to put the locals in the camp the
[2:50:18.080 --> 2:50:22.480]  private criminal was going to own still the local constabulary denies it even
[2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:25.600]  if it's admitted because they don't want to admit they're wrong
[2:50:25.600 --> 2:50:29.840]  and it's too scary to admit it's happening but that's correct
[2:50:29.840 --> 2:50:33.600]  but there's no problems in lying to the public and again
[2:50:33.600 --> 2:50:37.040]  and he's recently released uh documents from internal
[2:50:37.040 --> 2:50:40.560]  meeting the world health organization he said it would have to lie to the
[2:50:40.560 --> 2:50:43.520]  public they can't tell the public the truth this is from their own minutes
[2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:47.600]  of their meeting and these are all eugenicists and they talk
[2:50:47.600 --> 2:50:50.320]  about they go it's sad we have to kill everyone

[2:54:51.200 --> 2:54:54.880]  piggly wiggly gets the head of the line and then nobody else gets to get on so
[2:54:54.880 --> 2:55:00.240]  1-800-259-9231 that's coming up in the next hour ellen
[2:55:00.240 --> 2:55:04.080]  we were just talking during the break about social control it's just like the
[2:55:04.080 --> 2:55:07.680]  aztecs one of the dominant mesoamerican uh...
[2:55:07.680 --> 2:55:11.840]  mayan cultures and in their own writings and and and what the spanish
[2:55:11.840 --> 2:55:16.080]  observed mothers would beg to have their
[2:55:16.080 --> 2:55:18.960]  healthiest best because you wanted to have the best sacrifice
[2:55:18.960 --> 2:55:24.480]  ten-year-old only son cut up in pieces and then sold as meat by the priest
[2:55:24.480 --> 2:55:26.160]  class that's how they made their money
[2:55:26.160 --> 2:55:29.280]  to the locals and the mothers will gobble their children with pleasure
[2:55:29.280 --> 2:55:34.880]  uh... we have uh... major uh... news out of soul korea and china
[2:55:34.880 --> 2:55:38.640]  this is mainstream baby soup not a hoax
[2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:43.040]  eating babies people get upset if they see a dog killed by marines but not if
[2:55:43.040 --> 2:55:47.200]  they see a kid killed by marines we've been trained to see human life is bad
[2:55:47.200 --> 2:55:51.120]  and through mind control just the cultural mind control
[2:55:51.120 --> 2:55:54.720]  aztecs would kill their sons and daughters and wives and husbands
[2:55:54.720 --> 2:55:59.200]  with pleasure that the the the druids would do this
[2:55:59.200 --> 2:56:02.720]  and it's the same thing now we just give our kids to the state
[2:56:02.720 --> 2:56:05.440]  because they're up because our guests said earlier
[2:56:05.440 --> 2:56:08.960]  uh... in in in uh... and said yeah
[2:56:08.960 --> 2:56:12.080]  was really hard to lose the weight ruined my figure they said that was a
[2:56:12.080 --> 2:56:15.760]  symbol of depression so they took the baby from the family
[2:56:15.760 --> 2:56:20.000]  with no due process the criminal state is here go ahead
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:23.920]  yes uh... again too interesting to look at the old video
[2:56:23.920 --> 2:56:27.520]  i think it's not maybe on youtube i don't know i can't watch it because of my slow
[2:56:27.520 --> 2:56:31.200]  speed uh... they punish me for using explorer net
[2:56:31.200 --> 2:56:36.240]  but some uh... there was there was a julian hoxley up there now do hoxley
[2:56:36.240 --> 2:56:40.000]  and these guys would into this whole thing and i'll do hoxley himself who
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:44.400]  attended all the world meetings he also worked at tavistock institute
[2:56:44.400 --> 2:56:48.160]  he thought that the scientific dictatorship would be just so wonderful
[2:56:48.160 --> 2:56:50.640]  when it came in and the people would be
[2:56:50.640 --> 2:56:53.840]  trained to love their servitude but he also
[2:56:53.840 --> 2:56:57.280]  talked about the only obstacle they had
[2:56:57.280 --> 2:57:00.640]  at that time back in the fifties was the remnants
[2:57:00.640 --> 2:57:05.120]  of a powerful or almost post powerful christianity
[2:57:05.120 --> 2:57:09.680]  at that time it was with what his brother julian said that the first CEO of
[2:57:09.680 --> 2:57:12.880]  unesco he said we'll have to train the people
[2:57:12.880 --> 2:57:18.080]  to devaluate human life uh... in order to bring through mass abortions
[2:57:18.080 --> 2:57:22.000]  and eventually genetic selection and sterilization
[2:57:22.000 --> 2:57:26.640]  uh... so this is the plan unfolding now these guys were part of the big world
[2:57:26.640 --> 2:57:30.080]  meetings of their day they set their agendas they set their
[2:57:30.080 --> 2:57:33.120]  timetables they set up for the end of the millennium
[2:57:33.120 --> 2:57:36.000]  into the new that's now and that's what it calls
[2:57:36.000 --> 2:57:40.160]  called this the century of change and and they never alter their plan their
[2:57:40.160 --> 2:57:43.360]  plans are like long-term business plans set in stone
[2:57:43.360 --> 2:57:47.600]  with ten year plans for one part fifty for another a hundred for another
[2:57:47.600 --> 2:57:50.480]  we see this same type of plan cropping up
[2:57:50.480 --> 2:57:54.880]  in the declassified information puts out by the top think tanks for the
[2:57:54.880 --> 2:57:58.800]  military going up to the year 2050 and beyond
[2:57:58.800 --> 2:58:03.200]  and the kind of world that will be then and society will have them
[2:58:03.200 --> 2:58:06.720]  and we have of course the rockefella has caught around the world still
[2:58:06.720 --> 2:58:11.440]  pushing the depopulation plan eugenics plan if it is to survive
[2:58:11.440 --> 2:58:16.400]  the ratio gets sterilized and then wanted to simply killed off by various
[2:58:16.400 --> 2:58:20.560]  means this is happening as we live and the public
[2:58:20.560 --> 2:58:24.320]  don't even know it's happening because the trains to ignore
[2:58:24.320 --> 2:58:28.560]  and not participate in their own destiny got a break coming back
[2:58:28.560 --> 2:58:31.920]  fifty minutes left in the next hour without a lot
[2:58:31.920 --> 2:58:36.000]  this is what's happening and they're training us to turn our own predator
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:43.520]  instinct on our own species that's what the police the military all of it is

[3:00:00.240 --> 3:00:10.240]  work
[3:00:15.440 --> 3:00:19.840]  alan watt one of the main contributors
[3:00:19.840 --> 3:00:24.240]  the stars in paul republics i mean paul republic typically comes out march 15th
[3:00:24.240 --> 3:00:29.200]  next year the big eugenics film but uh your calls are coming up at
[3:00:29.200 --> 3:00:35.840]  1-800-259-9231 at the 20 after will take calls for two segments
[3:00:35.840 --> 3:00:40.480]  alan we were talking again about how they train us to feed on ourselves they
[3:00:40.480 --> 3:00:44.480]  domesticate us they train us not to notice what's happening
[3:00:44.480 --> 3:00:48.880]  and this whole agenda is rushing forward uh continue
[3:00:48.880 --> 3:00:52.400]  well going into the writings again of some of the biggest players who did
[3:00:52.400 --> 3:00:56.160]  publish lots of their work but we find their techniques because they
[3:00:56.160 --> 3:00:59.840]  explained their techniques and they were so assured of the
[3:00:59.840 --> 3:01:03.680]  them working that can only be done because of previous
[3:01:03.680 --> 3:01:09.360]  experimentation on populations and going back to the 30s 40s 50s 60s
[3:01:09.360 --> 3:01:14.640]  the hoax this for instance talks about uh people loving their servitude and
[3:01:14.640 --> 3:01:19.600]  they often use the term domestication that domesticate the public which what
[3:01:19.600 --> 3:01:23.200]  they meant was and even said this that the only true survivors that are fit to
[3:01:23.200 --> 3:01:28.000]  survive are wild animals that retain all of the survival capabilities
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:32.320]  in order to rule all the lesser types in previous humans who haven't made it to
[3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:35.360]  the top it has to domesticate them that meant
[3:01:35.360 --> 3:01:38.640]  to eradicate their instincts for self-preservation
[3:01:38.640 --> 3:01:42.400]  train them that experts were looking after everything that they would should
[3:01:42.400 --> 3:01:46.720]  look after by themselves and the even extent where they couldn't
[3:01:46.720 --> 3:01:50.960]  do anything without expert advice well but that a massive campaign since
[3:01:50.960 --> 3:01:55.360]  about the fifties onwards listened to the experts all through magazines tvs
[3:01:55.360 --> 3:01:59.520]  even in news breaks or even weather breaks you get experts coming on
[3:01:59.520 --> 3:02:05.120]  telling you how to dress for the rain uh this is a form of domestication
[3:02:05.120 --> 3:02:08.640]  it's meant to make you think that you know nothing you're too stupid to
[3:02:08.640 --> 3:02:12.640]  understand and just accept it accept there are
[3:02:12.640 --> 3:02:16.480]  better types of people above you taking care of all the big problems that you
[3:02:16.480 --> 3:02:20.240]  should be taking care of and your job is to simply play
[3:02:20.240 --> 3:02:23.840]  as much as you can play and enjoy yourself and don't become involved in the
[3:02:23.840 --> 3:02:27.760]  big problems in life to do with politics policies or anything
[3:02:27.760 --> 3:02:30.720]  else just accept it that's called domestication
[3:02:30.720 --> 3:02:34.960]  until you literally have no self-preservation
[3:02:34.960 --> 3:02:39.600]  instincts left when that happens you're now ready for extermination
[3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:42.880]  and then they can even train you as you say they're creating the children
[3:02:42.880 --> 3:02:46.800]  to volunteer for sterilization to save the world
[3:02:46.800 --> 3:02:50.640]  and of course this new religion of ecology
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:55.440]  is a religion as Gorbachev said we are creating a new religion based on a form
[3:02:55.440 --> 3:02:58.320]  of earth worship but of course it's got its own
[3:02:58.320 --> 3:03:02.880]  high priests that decide who should procreate who should not procreate
[3:03:02.880 --> 3:03:07.200]  and and that's not fast enough for them they want to start killing us off even
[3:03:07.200 --> 3:03:11.040]  faster but we're not breeding enough in the west to tell us that we're almost
[3:03:11.040 --> 3:03:14.240]  sterile but and hence the immigration levels are
[3:03:14.240 --> 3:03:17.280]  massive however we're not dying fast enough
[3:03:17.280 --> 3:03:20.560]  across the world so they want to speed up the process
[3:03:20.560 --> 3:03:24.480]  and know this children so you must you mustn't tell them any truth
[3:03:24.480 --> 3:03:27.760]  you must say it's also strange that these cancers
[3:03:27.760 --> 3:03:32.320]  are affecting everyone and everyone's dying and that'll be taught is just a
[3:03:32.320 --> 3:03:35.120]  new and you happening well they're saying that they're saying you're all
[3:03:35.120 --> 3:03:38.240]  just going to die of cancer and you're all just going to die of diabetes and
[3:03:38.240 --> 3:03:41.120]  that matter what you do just take your shot you're going to die and there's
[3:03:41.120 --> 3:03:44.240]  going to be lots of deaths and yeah it's a live virus and yeah
[3:03:44.240 --> 3:03:47.200]  you're going to die but it wasn't the vaccine but it does say on the insert
[3:03:47.200 --> 3:03:50.160]  it may kill you and it and this Gardasil is going to
[3:03:50.160 --> 3:03:53.120]  kill you but it doesn't protect you from the from the
[3:03:53.120 --> 3:03:56.240]  cancer but it will give you cancer but everything's fine
[3:03:56.240 --> 3:04:02.000]  and they just throw it all out there and it's like the public really is in a
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:05.200]  trance now more and more of them are starting to wake up
[3:04:05.200 --> 3:04:08.560]  so the establishments program is to shock us even more
[3:04:08.560 --> 3:04:12.800]  and pile on hoping people just give up
[3:04:12.800 --> 3:04:17.840]  yeah the technique they give the dialectical process the pros and the cons
[3:04:17.840 --> 3:04:21.920]  they get you into a punch drunk state and you simply give up
[3:04:21.920 --> 3:04:25.120]  and and and then you say well they can't be doing this
[3:04:25.120 --> 3:04:29.360]  for for negative reasons to kill us so i'll just go along with the rest of the
[3:04:29.360 --> 3:04:33.200]  public that's how simple it is people look around for a hero
[3:04:33.200 --> 3:04:37.280]  to follow and if there's no heroes they simply go along with the rest of the
[3:04:37.280 --> 3:04:41.840]  public and do what they do that's a hobby set himself
[3:04:41.840 --> 3:04:47.120]  now let's talk about in the short term what their program is long term but
[3:04:47.120 --> 3:04:50.240]  also solutions how you think this battle is going to shake out

[3:11:21.040 --> 3:11:24.880]  and it is these sponsors that make the whole show possible how are we able to

[3:11:38.160 --> 3:11:41.040]  shut up for this rest of the second before we go to calls
[3:11:41.040 --> 3:11:44.640]  getting into what their current operation is what you think is happening
[3:11:44.640 --> 3:11:48.000]  with the flu those new uh world health organization
[3:11:48.000 --> 3:11:52.240]  documents you have they're up on cutting through the matrix dot com
[3:11:52.240 --> 3:11:56.000]  and some news about how we beat these people
[3:11:56.000 --> 3:12:00.320]  now there is a big awakening happens so what that collision
[3:12:00.320 --> 3:12:04.560]  between people that want freedom and decent humanity
[3:12:04.560 --> 3:12:08.480]  and and and for honorableness to be held up and those that want death and
[3:12:08.480 --> 3:12:11.760]  destruction well i think the people first have to
[3:12:11.760 --> 3:12:15.440]  understand that they're not dealing with the democratic institutions
[3:12:15.440 --> 3:12:20.240]  you're dealing with people with an agenda who are all pre-chosen before they
[3:12:20.240 --> 3:12:23.840]  get into politics with trains and to their roles
[3:12:23.840 --> 3:12:28.480]  and they're all on board with this agenda so technically there's no
[3:12:28.480 --> 3:12:32.320]  negotiation with them to be honest with you the only thing that's left
[3:12:32.320 --> 3:12:36.320]  outside of outright revolution um it's where
[3:12:36.320 --> 3:12:40.240]  large groups of people to literally um uh hit them
[3:12:40.240 --> 3:12:45.120]  economically for instance an example the nurses of new york state
[3:12:45.120 --> 3:12:49.040]  have been told that uh they're going to be fired if they don't take
[3:12:49.040 --> 3:12:55.040]  the swine flu shot um my suggestion to them is for them to walk off on mass and
[3:12:55.040 --> 3:12:59.600]  just walk out the hospital on mass for a day or two and you'll see the house and
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:03.920]  the screams that those guys want you to bring you to the negotiating table
[3:13:03.920 --> 3:13:07.600]  that these are the only kinds of strategies left for people outside
[3:13:07.600 --> 3:13:11.120]  revolution and the boys at the top know this because
[3:13:11.120 --> 3:13:15.280]  they've been setting up internal armies and securities for
[3:13:15.280 --> 3:13:19.440]  20 years for this particular time that we're going through now
[3:13:19.440 --> 3:13:23.600]  they knew this time would come so uh to be honest there's no
[3:13:23.600 --> 3:13:27.200]  easy way out of this uh this is life or death uh
[3:13:27.200 --> 3:13:30.640]  situations that we're going through right now uh they have their deep
[3:13:30.640 --> 3:13:35.280]  population program the world health organization at their meeting in 2006
[3:13:35.280 --> 3:13:38.160]  the world's meeting stated that if they can get the
[3:13:38.160 --> 3:13:41.840]  public to accept mandatory inoculation for one thing
[3:13:41.840 --> 3:13:45.920]  then introduce more mandatory inoculations every year for the rest
[3:13:45.920 --> 3:13:49.760]  of the adult's life including annual boosters for every shot
[3:13:49.760 --> 3:13:53.760]  i've ever had we're going to be toxic laboratories walking out
[3:13:53.760 --> 3:13:57.440]  laboratories walking test tubes with a competent DNA
[3:13:57.440 --> 3:14:00.800]  all getting together and killing us all the quicker through cancers they know
[3:14:00.800 --> 3:14:04.800]  this at the top so we did the thing is you can't
[3:14:04.800 --> 3:14:08.480]  take a step forward to negotiate that what you say is no
[3:14:08.480 --> 3:14:11.840]  that's the word we're going to relearn is no and say no i'm not taking this i
[3:14:11.840 --> 3:14:15.840]  don't care what you want to do with me because you're going to kill me anyway
[3:14:15.840 --> 3:14:19.760]  so i'm not taking this chance and people have got to start regaining their
[3:14:19.760 --> 3:14:24.480]  individual rights and freedom you don't if you don't fight for them you don't
[3:14:24.480 --> 3:14:27.120]  have any you can't write something on a piece of
[3:14:27.120 --> 3:14:30.480]  paper and go back to sleep thinking it's all done
[3:14:30.480 --> 3:14:34.000]  and even the founding fathers of the u.s said that that every generation would
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:38.640]  have to fight to keep it and have been lulled into sleep by again
[3:14:38.640 --> 3:14:42.480]  propaganda and experts we're the experts we're in charge of all the big
[3:14:42.480 --> 3:14:46.000]  problems that you just don't understand and how involved
[3:14:46.000 --> 3:14:50.320]  so we have to say no no to everything that's coming down the pike
[3:14:50.320 --> 3:14:55.440]  no that's all we have left and alan continuing on the flu front
[3:14:55.440 --> 3:14:59.120]  they're now ordering kids to go to school to take it no law they just do it
[3:14:59.120 --> 3:15:03.840]  clinics all over the country are saying take it or you'll call cps on you no
[3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:08.400]  law they just do it we're seeing the real tyranny and they're bragging
[3:15:08.400 --> 3:15:13.760]  that they're setting the precedent to force over 56 vaccine boosters so that's
[3:15:13.760 --> 3:15:16.960]  now in the hundreds yeah every couple years
[3:15:16.960 --> 3:15:21.520]  of meningitis shots hepatitis shots the aids vaccine
[3:15:21.520 --> 3:15:24.640]  and bill gates is now bragged and it's in the associated press
[3:15:24.640 --> 3:15:28.320]  oh when he laughs when he gives a speech
[3:15:28.320 --> 3:15:33.360]  oh i found out we're giving people polio with the new vaccine it happens to be
[3:15:33.360 --> 3:15:36.640]  live and then the little elite clubs they all giggle
[3:15:36.640 --> 3:15:39.680]  because the local good old boys they're in on the fun
[3:15:39.680 --> 3:15:44.400]  that's Nigeria Nigeria's not got got now got a new evolved type of polio
[3:15:44.400 --> 3:15:47.920]  that they admit now that the World Health Organization came from the
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:50.320]  particular vaccine they were giving the people there
[3:15:50.320 --> 3:15:55.360]  has evolved into a new hyper polio that's rampaging through the public it
[3:15:55.360 --> 3:16:00.160]  came from the vaccine admitted because and now they admit in the mainstream
[3:16:00.160 --> 3:16:03.360]  literature that the live nasal vaccine is going to
[3:16:03.360 --> 3:16:07.680]  create hundreds of mutations and is what's spreading h1n1 so out in
[3:16:07.680 --> 3:16:11.360]  the open they they they hit us with all the fools
[3:16:11.360 --> 3:16:15.040]  that are shooting it up their kids nose sneezing on everybody
[3:16:15.040 --> 3:16:18.160]  and the public is so dumb down they can't even understand it
[3:16:18.160 --> 3:16:21.040]  again they've been trained that experts don't lie
[3:16:21.040 --> 3:16:25.200]  and uh we've had 50 years of training into this
[3:16:25.200 --> 3:16:28.560]  new type of system that the public can't believe
[3:16:28.560 --> 3:16:31.760]  and that's the as you see you can get up the ladder but until you literally
[3:16:31.760 --> 3:16:35.600]  cross the last wrong and stand on it you won't see the big picture and the
[3:16:35.600 --> 3:16:38.640]  last wrong is difficult it's difficult to cross and say
[3:16:38.640 --> 3:16:41.760]  they're not just talking about killing us they have been killing us and they
[3:16:41.760 --> 3:16:45.200]  want to kill more of us when you really understand that it's
[3:16:45.200 --> 3:16:48.960]  true that you'll see everything completely different from then on it
[3:16:48.960 --> 3:16:54.320]  as to what you can do so you can't negotiate with tyranny
[3:16:54.320 --> 3:16:58.080]  well the key here is they're not negotiating they're not stopping it's a
[3:16:58.080 --> 3:17:00.960]  power cult yeah and we have to admit they're
[3:17:00.960 --> 3:17:04.800]  testing the soft kill now and i want to talk some about solutions here
[3:17:04.800 --> 3:17:08.240]  uh but everything you you know bring up just just just literally flags come up
[3:17:08.240 --> 3:17:12.080]  because it's all so accurate
[3:17:13.040 --> 3:17:16.560]  you're dealing with all of this and watching them kill us
[3:17:16.560 --> 3:17:20.800]  and then all the petty power people who don't even care if they're being killed
[3:17:20.800 --> 3:17:23.920]  themselves as long as they can kill people under them
[3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:27.680]  it's very sick yeah and again to the test at all
[3:17:27.680 --> 3:17:31.280]  whether it's Stanford is a big player and there's all the universities have
[3:17:31.280 --> 3:17:36.800]  specialized areas in creating vaccines or vacuum or viruses for warfare purposes
[3:17:36.800 --> 3:17:39.760]  but they're also into the social science and psychology
[3:17:39.760 --> 3:17:43.280]  and Stanford is one of the prime universities for
[3:17:43.280 --> 3:17:47.360]  for mass control basically they did the the old days of the mill guard
[3:17:47.360 --> 3:17:52.800]  experiments upon on testing people's obedience to authority by
[3:17:52.800 --> 3:17:55.920]  shocking people these treating people that are actually shocking i think to
[3:17:55.920 --> 3:17:59.360]  many other side of the glass it was there was actors on the other side of the
[3:17:59.360 --> 3:18:02.400]  glass but they didn't know and they got to kill voltage
[3:18:02.400 --> 3:18:05.520]  on the dial there as long as someone above them took
[3:18:05.520 --> 3:18:10.000]  authority and responsibility for it they know how to use the public against
[3:18:10.000 --> 3:18:13.920]  the public yeah 90 you could take a farm boy making
[3:18:13.920 --> 3:18:18.000]  a cop six months later 90 in the stanford research
[3:18:18.000 --> 3:18:21.840]  will put a gun to their mother's head and blow her brains across the room
[3:18:21.840 --> 3:18:25.360]  if someone in a uniform orders them to do it yes
[3:18:25.360 --> 3:18:30.160]  and and it's true to their old techniques to be understood by the high
[3:18:30.160 --> 3:18:33.680]  you know sciences and all cults guys and masonry and so on
[3:18:33.680 --> 3:18:39.280]  at the top if you find it in the riots of new york in 1800s
[3:18:39.280 --> 3:18:43.760]  that's um the mayor uh at the time a whole riot he says uh
[3:18:43.760 --> 3:18:47.760]  he said that people can always hire half the poor to kill the other half
[3:18:47.760 --> 3:18:52.080]  that's what he said if they understand this that money's the key
[3:18:52.080 --> 3:18:56.480]  uh i can survive but get money out on the winning side to leave me alone
[3:18:56.480 --> 3:18:59.360]  that's what they think until their usefulness is over
[3:18:59.360 --> 3:19:03.120]  and then they're they're eliminated too
[3:19:03.600 --> 3:19:07.280]  unbelievable alan let's do this let's come back and take calls and then at the
[3:19:07.280 --> 3:19:10.480]  end of the last segment let's get into a little bit of solutions but we're going
[3:19:10.480 --> 3:19:12.560]  to have you back up for more of that as well
[3:19:12.560 --> 3:19:16.000]  but i guess what you're saying is the big solution is becoming aware of this
[3:19:16.000 --> 3:19:20.160]  matrix of propaganda and social engineering and really getting upset
[3:19:20.160 --> 3:19:24.160]  about it and really talking human to human about the ruling elite
[3:19:24.160 --> 3:19:28.400]  and their program for humanity and ask the public do you like being controlled
[3:19:28.400 --> 3:19:31.360]  do you like being poisoned do you like everybody being
[3:19:31.360 --> 3:19:34.720]  blubbery and and bleach skin and unhealthy and
[3:19:34.720 --> 3:19:37.840]  zits all over the place i mean do you like being poisoned do you like to
[3:19:37.840 --> 3:19:41.360]  have the kids in your neighborhood dead or dying of diseases or cancer
[3:19:41.360 --> 3:19:44.480]  i mean is this what because it's only going to get worse i mean
[3:19:44.480 --> 3:19:48.480]  is it fun i mean the cops out there is the petty power the petty manhood
[3:19:48.480 --> 3:19:52.400]  rituals is it fun do you like being used are you

[3:25:42.800 --> 3:25:47.520]  hi alex i spoke to you a couple of days ago and i was telling you about my son
[3:25:47.520 --> 3:25:50.720]  that i just enrolled in school and i wanted to find out what i could do as
[3:25:50.720 --> 3:25:54.960]  far as the vaccine and everything um i live right outside of houston i went
[3:25:54.960 --> 3:25:59.840]  to my son's nurse yesterday and asked her for the vaccine exemption form
[3:25:59.840 --> 3:26:03.360]  she said she has nothing like that she didn't want to give me any information
[3:26:03.360 --> 3:26:06.560]  she's a liar basically understood okay you have to go to the health
[3:26:06.560 --> 3:26:10.480]  department let's do this live on tv right now guys
[3:26:10.480 --> 3:26:16.640]  google texas vaccine exemption form and we will be on the state health department
[3:26:16.640 --> 3:26:20.880]  and you just print it off and you mail it in and of the criminals at that school
[3:26:20.880 --> 3:26:24.720]  who get money for shooting your kid up their their federal funds are almost
[3:26:24.720 --> 3:26:29.200]  exclusively tied to that it's so important the government wants that
[3:26:29.200 --> 3:26:33.200]  that that that you then go in and you give it to them and then that they're open
[3:26:33.200 --> 3:26:37.760]  for massive criminal charges if they try to kick your child out but see their
[3:26:37.760 --> 3:26:42.560]  criminal charges on your child are for truancy when they kick them out
[3:26:42.560 --> 3:26:46.160]  that's what they talk about arresting you for shots
[3:26:46.160 --> 3:26:53.200]  they're total criminals so uh there it is okay uh there is the state of texas
[3:26:53.200 --> 3:26:57.120]  texas vaccine exemption form and you just google that
[3:26:57.120 --> 3:27:01.120]  and you can print the form off secure online request for exemption at the
[3:27:01.120 --> 3:27:04.960]  david and there's copies of them online but i guess here
[3:27:04.960 --> 3:27:09.280]  the state's now making you ask to screw it up but they've got to give it to you
[3:27:09.280 --> 3:27:12.720]  i'm sorry man i don't mean to get mad i'm just so tired of lying criminals
[3:27:12.720 --> 3:27:17.040]  but again this this evil woman or man they feel like it's good like like a
[3:27:17.040 --> 3:27:21.360]  death camp operator oh they're helping by lying to you
[3:27:21.360 --> 3:27:25.200]  and believe me a school nurse knows they're lying alan what
[3:27:25.200 --> 3:27:28.880]  yes they do another some true believers in their profession are brainwashed
[3:27:28.880 --> 3:27:32.080]  themselves in fact the big boys say that the first ones you have your brain
[3:27:32.080 --> 3:27:34.880]  wash are the ones who manage the rest of the public
[3:27:34.880 --> 3:27:38.720]  and a lot of them truly believe it but there's a lot of nurses too that that
[3:27:38.720 --> 3:27:43.360]  understand that they've seen the effects of inoculations and that's why
[3:27:43.360 --> 3:27:47.200]  close to 60 percent are saying no in new york shelly new york state actually
[3:27:47.200 --> 3:27:50.800]  this is the thing with new york state they made it a policy the big board
[3:27:50.800 --> 3:27:54.320]  controls the health authority for new york state a policy and instead of
[3:27:54.320 --> 3:27:58.480]  policy there will be no exemptions for religious or philosophical
[3:27:58.480 --> 3:28:03.600]  or or or even even diabetic reasons uh for the first time in their history
[3:28:03.600 --> 3:28:07.120]  they've actually got diabetics yeah even if you're a doctor
[3:28:07.120 --> 3:28:10.160]  because this is key you can find an anti-vaccine doctor
[3:28:10.160 --> 3:28:13.120]  by googling in any major city if you're in a small town you have to go to big
[3:28:13.120 --> 3:28:16.800]  city they will give you a medical exemption and they admit on the flu
[3:28:16.800 --> 3:28:20.800]  shots hundreds of things if you've got allergies you're not supposed to take
[3:28:20.800 --> 3:28:24.960]  shots because they admit that it is going to cause an autoimmune response
[3:28:24.960 --> 3:28:28.880]  but but now they're trying to say we don't care the medical doctor says no
[3:28:28.880 --> 3:28:32.240]  we got SWAT teams who want to kill they want blood

[3:29:00.640 --> 3:29:03.920]  that i can find that i can allow but then let me guess houston's trying to
[3:29:03.920 --> 3:29:07.920]  force you to take it though that i don't know

[3:33:22.240 --> 3:33:29.040]  big john big john all right i didn't mean to go off into a
[3:33:29.040 --> 3:33:32.240]  rant i was just talking to one of my producers for the radio guys
[3:33:32.240 --> 3:33:36.960]  rob do about how they nobody's seen and his wife's in education how they tried
[3:33:36.960 --> 3:33:41.840]  for months to get it in the exemption for maybe laugh and say it doesn't exist
[3:33:41.840 --> 3:33:45.360]  up until a month ago you could always just print it off online
[3:33:45.360 --> 3:33:49.040]  now i guess they make you get one from them they're real bastards
[3:33:49.040 --> 3:33:53.360]  uh... but uh... going back to how a lot before we continue with calls
[3:33:53.360 --> 3:33:56.560]  yeah there's always these little ring around the rosy games it's in the
[3:33:56.560 --> 3:34:00.480]  dallas morning news they're kicking kids out if they don't take the regular shot
[3:34:00.480 --> 3:34:04.720]  seasonal flu and the new one and i i showed dallas morning news yesterday
[3:34:04.720 --> 3:34:08.720]  austin's announcing it but there's no law they're saying you don't have to but
[3:34:08.720 --> 3:34:12.800]  you have to and then you say well i want an extension for me laugh at you and
[3:34:12.800 --> 3:34:16.880]  say you don't have to honey i mean this is just so sick
[3:34:16.880 --> 3:34:20.400]  and and and these locals they always get like a little piggy face a little
[3:34:20.400 --> 3:34:26.080]  demonic smile what is that programming where they revel in abusing people they
[3:34:26.080 --> 3:34:30.800]  revel in line you know what you've got really is what i said about
[3:34:30.800 --> 3:34:34.400]  the soviet system and the hero worship of the man at the top
[3:34:34.400 --> 3:34:38.400]  the team with uh... with uh... the nazi regime in germany
[3:34:38.400 --> 3:34:42.160]  uh... what they found was all the officers down below are sadomasochists
[3:34:42.160 --> 3:34:46.640]  and this is how power works uh... it's a sadomasochistic thing that attracts
[3:34:46.640 --> 3:34:50.880]  psychopathic types into those positions that you're the only ones who go into
[3:34:50.880 --> 3:34:54.960]  them and they worship the person above them with power
[3:34:54.960 --> 3:34:59.680]  and the despise the person beneath them who has less power than themselves
[3:34:59.680 --> 3:35:02.560]  that's how simply it works with sadomasochism
[3:35:02.560 --> 3:35:06.480]  and you'll always have the strange sadomasochistic authoritarianism
[3:35:06.480 --> 3:35:10.400]  when you get into politics and right down to local politics even
[3:35:10.400 --> 3:35:15.280]  any authority this is the very thing that carol young warned the public about
[3:35:15.280 --> 3:35:20.160]  back in the fifties he talked with iron curtain across germany
[3:35:20.160 --> 3:35:23.280]  but he also said he says i see an iron curtain of massive
[3:35:23.280 --> 3:35:27.520]  bureaucracies building up with with governmental agencies
[3:35:27.520 --> 3:35:31.120]  stifling and strangling the freedom of the whole planet
[3:35:31.120 --> 3:35:34.240]  uh... he understood what was coming down the pike back then
[3:35:34.240 --> 3:35:37.840]  many of of his generation did in fact because they're involved in meeting
[3:35:37.840 --> 3:35:41.760]  high-level people and he knew that the world we're bringing in
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:46.000]  would be one of tyranny by force and that's what you've got
[3:35:46.000 --> 3:35:50.480]  one of the criteria of tyranny is when you're forced into a position by
[3:35:50.480 --> 3:35:55.600]  authorities and without any escape routes in other words you have no choice
[3:35:55.600 --> 3:36:01.760]  that is tyranny when you have no choice in any situation
[3:36:01.760 --> 3:36:06.160]  well you're absolutely right they since they don't have a choice they learn to
[3:36:06.160 --> 3:36:10.880]  love it and love the defendant and so when you say hey the banks just
[3:36:10.880 --> 3:36:14.080]  stole 23.7 trillion we got to pay it back
[3:36:14.080 --> 3:36:18.240]  with interest they just laugh and and will say i'm part of the power
[3:36:18.240 --> 3:36:21.680]  structure and it's almost like a five-year-old dressing up
[3:36:21.680 --> 3:36:26.480]  like their Luke Skywalker dressing up like their
[3:36:26.480 --> 3:36:30.800]  you know some hero that it's like the public or eternal
[3:36:30.800 --> 3:36:35.680]  children and they're they they imagine things they
[3:36:35.680 --> 3:36:40.880]  they they're delusional and i never had a view of myself as something special
[3:36:40.880 --> 3:36:45.520]  or wonderful or good i'm just a person that has my instincts intact
[3:36:45.520 --> 3:36:49.440]  and you know having a bunch of psychos writing books about how they're killing
[3:36:49.440 --> 3:36:52.720]  me with vaccines and stuff in the water and then i can see the evidence
[3:36:52.720 --> 3:36:55.840]  they're doing it i mean if they write hundreds of books about how
[3:36:55.840 --> 3:37:01.040]  they're killing us and how how it's a scientific dictatorship wouldn't
[3:37:01.040 --> 3:37:04.880]  there be something wrong with me if i didn't as a red-blooded male
[3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:09.520]  not stand up for my species against a up against a power tripping group
[3:37:09.520 --> 3:37:13.520]  that's playing god absolutely and part of the key of
[3:37:13.520 --> 3:37:17.440]  of obedience as they stand for another university they're into these experiments
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:21.120]  all the time around a billion sort of ci involved with them obviously
[3:37:21.120 --> 3:37:26.880]  and what they find is with the more power they accumulate in any agency
[3:37:26.880 --> 3:37:31.440]  in a stage of masochistic power structure that they begin to despise the
[3:37:31.440 --> 3:37:35.600]  ordinary people who who begin to cow under authority
[3:37:35.600 --> 3:37:39.040]  the more that people cow under authority the more the despised
[3:37:39.040 --> 3:37:43.680]  is is almost reclaims and and eventually hated by those in power
[3:37:43.680 --> 3:37:48.400]  uh i've always said it's like a a farmer breaking the legs of a cow it falls to
[3:37:48.400 --> 3:37:51.840]  the ground then he starts kicking it because they can't get up
[3:37:51.840 --> 3:37:56.880]  that's the very system is in play today with the state of masochistic total
[3:37:56.880 --> 3:38:00.160]  power structure that's set up this is a hell on earth convenient
[3:38:00.160 --> 3:38:05.200]  and it's up to us to fight it with utterly with every means that we have
[3:38:05.200 --> 3:38:08.400]  well i think that one of the most effective ways to attack it is to just
[3:38:08.400 --> 3:38:13.200]  show people the matrix of false reality and reach out to police military
[3:38:13.200 --> 3:38:17.120]  bureaucrats and go you know your little cousin just
[3:38:17.120 --> 3:38:21.360]  out of cancer at 22 that's not normal here's some statistics
[3:38:21.360 --> 3:38:24.560]  do you know what's in the water do you know what's in the shots here
[3:38:24.560 --> 3:38:30.160]  here's ap admitting they're giving everyone polio with the polio vaccine
[3:38:30.160 --> 3:38:34.480]  and you're not going to listen now because you have defenses up
[3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:38.080]  but deep down in your instincts you know i'm telling you the truth
[3:38:38.080 --> 3:38:43.040]  you're being manipulated and i found that six months down the road a year down
[3:38:43.040 --> 3:38:48.240]  the road they then wake up and just showing them how
[3:38:48.240 --> 3:38:51.440]  they're not in the power structure like they
[3:38:51.440 --> 3:38:55.360]  think they are how they're being attacked as well
[3:38:55.360 --> 3:38:58.480]  it was interesting to see this new world order
[3:38:58.480 --> 3:39:02.560]  is to go through a series of changes including the riot phase for
[3:39:02.560 --> 3:39:05.680]  30 odd years as they bring down the food supply
[3:39:05.680 --> 3:39:09.440]  and then the united nations takes over the distribution of food to all the
[3:39:09.440 --> 3:39:12.880]  different regions as they call these sections of the world
[3:39:12.880 --> 3:39:16.640]  and they say their own writings and the united nations that will
[3:39:16.640 --> 3:39:20.960]  gradually reduce these this ration to each area
[3:39:20.960 --> 3:39:25.120]  every year and it's up to you to bring your population down to accommodate
[3:39:25.120 --> 3:39:29.760]  and use the resources are given to you this is all their plan and this is how
[3:39:29.760 --> 3:39:33.680]  on earth they're being in step by step and of course the reduction of
[3:39:33.680 --> 3:39:38.400]  population via mass literally it's um
[3:39:38.400 --> 3:39:41.600]  but we're being killed off by inoculations and they know this
[3:39:41.600 --> 3:39:45.680]  and that's all stated and they all brag about it yeah and you'll tell some mom
[3:39:45.680 --> 3:39:49.200]  and she'll arrogantly laugh at you take your kid who already looks like a
[3:39:49.200 --> 3:39:52.560]  zombie and and you just shoot them up with
[3:39:52.560 --> 3:39:55.680]  some more and then they'll look at you with pleasure you crazy
[3:39:55.680 --> 3:39:58.480]  nut it doesn't matter if you just quoted
[3:39:58.480 --> 3:40:02.240]  state department random 200 yes it doesn't matter if you're quoting you in
[3:40:02.240 --> 3:40:05.520]  documents it doesn't matter they don't care
[3:40:05.520 --> 3:40:08.880]  and then when their kid dies they'll wear a little cancer ribbon and
[3:40:08.880 --> 3:40:15.360]  cry and it's like a celebrity thing oh your kid died too
[3:40:15.360 --> 3:40:18.560]  you know because it's all about euthanizing everybody that's what this
[3:40:18.560 --> 3:40:23.360]  is all about it is euthanasia and it's a bacteria bacteria warfare is by all
[3:40:23.360 --> 3:40:27.760]  warfare it's by all warfare it carefully designed and as they
[3:40:27.760 --> 3:40:31.760]  know this stuff has been released recently from the internal meetings
[3:40:31.760 --> 3:40:35.120]  uh at the world health organization they admit
[3:40:35.120 --> 3:40:41.120]  that all of these particles of of DNA and RNA and so on recombined within the
[3:40:41.120 --> 3:40:44.160]  body infect the cells of the person and cause
[3:40:44.160 --> 3:40:48.720]  cancers down the road they understand well they grow it in the exact type of
[3:40:48.720 --> 3:40:52.640]  monkeys and fetal tissue that have the cancer virus that's most
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:40:55.920]  viral that's most deadly in it well actually that they've said now they've
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:40:59.760]  stated now that they're actually using especially for this new swine flu
[3:40:59.760 --> 3:41:03.360]  rather than use the eggs chicken eggs and so on for doing so which also contains
[3:41:03.360 --> 3:41:08.080]  thousands of foreign they're using cancer virus instead of the dead baby
[3:41:08.080 --> 3:41:14.320]  retinas because of the green monkey kidneys uh or the uh other growth
[3:41:14.320 --> 3:41:18.320]  mediums you're right they are using cancer virus that's what they say
[3:41:18.320 --> 3:41:21.360]  because the cancer virus is a survivor so they're using that as a
[3:41:21.360 --> 3:41:25.280]  hello yeah yeah isn't that sweet i'm gonna move
[3:41:25.280 --> 3:41:29.840]  the calls quickly now mark and origan you're on the air go ahead
[3:41:29.840 --> 3:41:34.000]  hi alex and alan honor to speak with you thank you for your great information
[3:41:34.000 --> 3:41:39.040]  thank you for your great wisdom even uh alex on monday's show that you had
[3:41:39.040 --> 3:41:42.640]  mentioned that there were 10 million doses of the flu
[3:41:42.640 --> 3:41:45.280]  miss being sent out into the country on monday
[3:41:45.280 --> 3:41:48.320]  they will have arrived or probably have arrived at the destination by now i'm
[3:41:48.320 --> 3:41:52.960]  sure many of destinations that it's arriving to are the walmart stores
[3:41:52.960 --> 3:41:58.640]  well they said they said last friday that 200 000 were going to tennessee
[3:41:58.640 --> 3:42:05.600]  indiana and texas and that then by the end of the next week 10 million more
[3:42:05.600 --> 3:42:11.120]  would start flowing and then they admit there's been no testing of the h1n1
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:15.360]  and that they're making people sign secrecy forms and waving their rights
[3:42:15.360 --> 3:42:21.120]  when they take the nasal yes you also reported alex the mayo clinic has come
[3:42:21.120 --> 3:42:25.360]  out and said that the flu mist will be much more contagious to other people
[3:42:25.360 --> 3:42:29.360]  it takes 10 to 20 days as i understand it at this point for the actual symptoms
[3:42:29.360 --> 3:42:33.520]  to manifest in someone who has received an injected or a flu mist
[3:42:33.520 --> 3:42:37.120]  vaccination now i think the time clock has already
[3:42:37.120 --> 3:42:40.880]  uh started on this and that the actual mass
[3:42:40.880 --> 3:42:46.560]  murder genocide that there that this operation consists of and it is not a
[3:42:46.560 --> 3:42:50.720]  drill absolutely not a drill it's set in motion now as to where it's
[3:42:50.720 --> 3:42:53.920]  going to follow through with the actual sickness itself
[3:42:53.920 --> 3:42:57.120]  and people have been going to become so sick and weak that they're going to
[3:42:57.120 --> 3:43:00.480]  accept martial law and i think this is the first stage
[3:43:00.480 --> 3:43:04.640]  of the operation for this we're going to find out
[3:43:04.640 --> 3:43:09.920]  by the end of october early november whether it's meant to mutate really be
[3:43:09.920 --> 3:43:12.320]  deadly or if this is just setting the precedent
[3:43:12.320 --> 3:43:15.600]  for us to go under world health organization rules and to set the
[3:43:15.600 --> 3:43:20.000]  precedent to take the shots as they've stated we know it's at least that bad
[3:43:20.000 --> 3:43:24.240]  alan watt what do you think's going on it is true i think it proposed both
[3:43:24.240 --> 3:43:28.000]  purposes uh you become a human incubator when you
[3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:31.760]  take on the stuff you are now the new egg if you like you the new reactors it
[3:43:31.760 --> 3:43:35.520]  breeds within you and they admit you shed the virus
[3:43:35.520 --> 3:43:38.640]  to all those around you there's no doubt about that
[3:43:38.640 --> 3:43:43.120]  and uh what's interesting to me is putting this kind of thing into a
[3:43:43.120 --> 3:43:47.680]  mist form uh this supposed virus would kill
[3:43:47.680 --> 3:43:52.320]  primarily attacking the respiratory system the nasal passages and bronchial
[3:43:52.320 --> 3:43:55.600]  tubes in the lungs but so they're bringing it right into the very areas and
[3:43:55.600 --> 3:43:58.960]  they admit that the adjuvants are designed to track
[3:43:58.960 --> 3:44:03.120]  leukocytes and phageocytes to attack the stuff
[3:44:03.120 --> 3:44:07.120]  right into the lung area which might cause you to die with those that don't
[3:44:07.120 --> 3:44:11.440]  know that's the that's the auto immune storm
[3:44:11.440 --> 3:44:15.280]  of how the 1918 killed tens of millions
[3:44:15.280 --> 3:44:19.520]  it's the auto immune response to the virus that kills you in hours with
[3:44:19.520 --> 3:44:22.480]  flood with with fluid and and now we're getting reports
[3:44:22.480 --> 3:44:25.520]  they're covering enough that people are taking it and collapsing
[3:44:25.520 --> 3:44:28.560]  and so alan i want to be very clear about what you just said
[3:44:28.560 --> 3:44:32.400]  they admit in the literature that it can cause
[3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:35.840]  the auto immune response and you're right you're injecting you're injecting
[3:44:35.840 --> 3:44:39.680]  live virus into the nasal passages into the lungs
[3:44:39.680 --> 3:44:43.840]  which can then cause the auto immune response and Reuters is out ahead of
[3:44:43.840 --> 3:44:46.000]  it saying there's going to be lots of deaths
[3:44:46.000 --> 3:44:49.440]  but it's after you take the shot but it's not the shot
[3:44:49.440 --> 3:44:53.440]  now how obvious is that yes it's very obvious
[3:44:53.440 --> 3:44:56.720]  and and again it's truthful that you say that it is to
[3:44:56.720 --> 3:45:00.480]  clean us to take the annual shots and boosters for the rest of our lives that's
[3:45:00.480 --> 3:45:06.080]  what it said at the world health organization 2006 meeting
[3:45:06.080 --> 3:45:09.360]  all right i hope you're wrong mark but we at least know they're setting the
[3:45:09.360 --> 3:45:12.720]  precedent for the big soft kill that's coming but we're going to find out the
[3:45:12.720 --> 3:45:16.160]  next few months here buddy it didn't look good i'll say that i mean they admit
[3:45:16.160 --> 3:45:19.280]  it's live virus they're putting into 10 million morons
[3:45:19.280 --> 3:45:22.000]  uh... let's go ahead and talk to john in arkansas
[3:45:22.000 --> 3:45:27.040]  john you're on the air go ahead hi elixir this is john i spoke to you about the
[3:45:27.040 --> 3:45:31.120]  police um stopping me and trying to
[3:45:31.120 --> 3:45:35.520]  give me to take the shot yeah tell us tell us about that again
[3:45:35.520 --> 3:45:41.360]  because uh... expand on that yes i was on my way home
[3:45:41.360 --> 3:45:43.920]  from a girlfriend's house and a police officer here
[3:45:43.920 --> 3:45:47.680]  and little rock stop me is like hey how you doing you like us a little like to
[3:45:47.680 --> 3:45:50.480]  be out and i'm like yeah it's okay i'm just come from a girlfriend's house
[3:45:50.480 --> 3:45:53.680]  oh it's a free country you know the guy's got to ask you why you're out at night
[3:45:53.680 --> 3:45:58.160]  you know you're a slave go ahead and he was like so have you um taken your
[3:45:58.160 --> 3:46:02.720]  um gotten your flu shot yet i said no and he said why not i said because that's
[3:46:02.720 --> 3:46:07.600]  government propaganda and it contains mercury which kills you
[3:46:07.600 --> 3:46:10.960]  and he looked at me kind of crazy he said so you're you're gonna probably
[3:46:10.960 --> 3:46:15.040]  spout out some new world order crap huh i said yeah i was kind of thinking that
[3:46:15.040 --> 3:46:17.440]  and kind of telling you to fuck off right about now
[3:46:17.440 --> 3:46:20.720]  i'm gonna let you go sir i i understand that happened to you but we really
[3:46:20.720 --> 3:46:23.360]  need to remember we have a lot of children listening okay buddy
[3:46:23.360 --> 3:46:28.800]  uh no no more for uh that caller let's talk to mike in texas mike you're on
[3:46:28.800 --> 3:46:32.720]  the air go ahead hey guys can you hear me all right
[3:46:32.720 --> 3:46:36.800]  yes go ahead um i've just been that this
[3:46:36.800 --> 3:46:40.480]  this is in regards i guess more of the eugenic kind of stuff that you guys are
[3:46:40.480 --> 3:46:44.160]  talking about um i studied uh
[3:46:44.160 --> 3:46:48.000]  soviet union uh history and politics when i was in
[3:46:48.000 --> 3:46:51.280]  uh university and we covered the arrow fee
[3:46:51.280 --> 3:46:58.960]  um a lot of the genetic mutations and aberrations that uh resulted from the
[3:46:58.960 --> 3:47:02.960]  pesticides and other stuff that was running off through the irrigation
[3:47:02.960 --> 3:47:08.800]  bitches of the farmers um i'm just curious to know if a lot of the
[3:47:08.800 --> 3:47:13.840]  similar stuff is being put into this kind of gmo food and the
[3:47:13.840 --> 3:47:18.160]  fast food and other stuff that incredibly good point let me briefly
[3:47:18.160 --> 3:47:22.240]  say that they've done studies were over 90 percent
[3:47:22.240 --> 3:47:25.920]  i want to say 97 you can pull it up of people in india
[3:47:25.920 --> 3:47:30.000]  of the sewage systems have the sb 40 live cancer virus
[3:47:30.000 --> 3:47:34.160]  they don't just inject this in people it then spreads and mutates in us as
[3:47:34.160 --> 3:47:37.600]  incubators as alam was saying now i've interviewed genetic
[3:47:37.600 --> 3:47:40.640]  engineer genetic engineer guys making millions a year
[3:47:40.640 --> 3:47:44.080]  guys who were running whole facilities and they would find that they would be
[3:47:44.080 --> 3:47:47.360]  told by other engineers they were just running plants
[3:47:47.360 --> 3:47:50.640]  to make the potato this way the tomato that way
[3:47:50.640 --> 3:47:55.120]  insert this gene and they noticed we've had them on the show over and over again
[3:47:55.120 --> 3:47:58.320]  that it was a combination change that would change other things
[3:47:58.320 --> 3:48:02.640]  and produce a pharmacological crop that's what it's called pharmacological
[3:48:02.640 --> 3:48:07.520]  crops that would also sterilize all the guinea pigs and rats they tested it on
[3:48:07.520 --> 3:48:11.200]  and so yes and that's what they said they're going to have food crops already
[3:48:11.200 --> 3:48:14.640]  have them with vaccines in them with live viruses in them
[3:48:14.640 --> 3:48:18.320]  and that and that the very gmo food it's already going on
[3:48:18.320 --> 3:48:21.840]  alan what yes i also have the information it's often
[3:48:21.840 --> 3:48:24.960]  websites inside the united nations that they're into crops
[3:48:24.960 --> 3:48:28.880]  uh for the last 15 years for third world countries especially
[3:48:28.880 --> 3:48:32.480]  all kinds of stuff including corn that would have that would actually help
[3:48:32.480 --> 3:48:35.520]  sterilize the people and bring down the population rate
[3:48:35.520 --> 3:48:39.840]  you find rockefeller himself is in charge of the rice campaign technical
[3:48:39.840 --> 3:48:43.760]  the golden rice campaign that's getting on a modified rights to
[3:48:43.760 --> 3:48:47.040]  probably countries that's now being imported back into the u.s.
[3:48:47.040 --> 3:48:50.560]  and other countries too this stuff also was designed also to
[3:48:50.560 --> 3:48:58.320]  to lower the sperm in in the meals etc that's that's stuff on their own side
[3:48:59.600 --> 3:49:02.720]  alan i was going to do some financial news in the final segment when i want to
[3:49:02.720 --> 3:49:05.360]  hold you to the variance we can take a few more calls are you game for that
[3:49:05.360 --> 3:49:08.800]  yes 10 more minutes okay let's take another call here
[3:49:08.800 --> 3:49:13.200]  let's talk to uh mike in texas mike you're on the air
[3:49:13.200 --> 3:49:16.480]  would you talk to mike loyden connecticut sorry loyd go ahead
[3:49:16.480 --> 3:49:20.080]  how you doing alex good um a friend of mine
[3:49:20.080 --> 3:49:27.680]  uh wife works for big uh hmo you know in three years ago they had a meeting and
[3:49:27.680 --> 3:49:31.520]  um they discussed flu and her husband got so paranoid he went out and bought
[3:49:31.520 --> 3:49:36.880]  bought dried food so you know how can they know that
[3:49:36.880 --> 3:49:40.880]  far in advance unless it's planned you know
[3:49:40.880 --> 3:49:46.080]  sir in january we had emergency managers on and in documents for major states
[3:49:46.080 --> 3:49:49.680]  where they were saying in november december millions were going to die
[3:49:49.680 --> 3:49:52.960]  i'm not saying that's going to happen the feds were telling police departments
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:56.800]  the citizens will attack you in the winter so
[3:49:56.800 --> 3:49:59.760]  they're clearly getting ready for something that they're testing the
[3:49:59.760 --> 3:50:03.840]  water i don't know but yes they this is all pre-planned
[3:50:03.840 --> 3:50:08.000]  now and what there's no doubt about it too in fact there were
[3:50:08.000 --> 3:50:11.920]  uh the the rinse talking to john holdren they were that bookie co-science
[3:50:11.920 --> 3:50:15.920]  along with the other big hygienists and ecologists which
[3:50:15.920 --> 3:50:20.000]  really the population experts they admitted then that have to find ways
[3:50:20.000 --> 3:50:23.360]  of putting things in the water and the food and that was what they're doing
[3:50:23.360 --> 3:50:25.760]  years ago and you go further back again into the
[3:50:25.760 --> 3:50:29.760]  hoxley's talking about the same thing and russles putting stuff in the food but
[3:50:29.760 --> 3:50:34.320]  veteran russle lord veteran russle in charge of one of the biggest departments
[3:50:34.320 --> 3:50:37.600]  inside the royal issues international affairs said
[3:50:37.600 --> 3:50:40.960]  they would also use the needle to bring to be the people
[3:50:40.960 --> 3:50:45.520]  a compliance and to bring down the population yeah that's the worst to
[3:50:45.520 --> 3:50:48.880]  use many cases folks when these hospitals kill your
[3:50:48.880 --> 3:50:52.400]  family your kids just remember who did it the new world order
[3:50:52.400 --> 3:50:54.560]  they think you're stupid they think you're not going to notice what's
[3:50:54.560 --> 3:50:57.840]  happening final segment lords stay there for comments from you as well
[3:50:57.840 --> 3:51:02.000]  we'll be right back
[3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:05.680]  thomas jefferson once said when the people fear their government there is
[3:51:05.680 --> 3:51:08.320]  tyranny when the government fears the people
[3:51:08.320 --> 3:51:12.000]  there is liberty our god given right to life and liberty
[3:51:12.000 --> 3:51:15.520]  and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health
[3:51:15.520 --> 3:51:19.840]  are in jeopardy if we the people do not diligently assert these rights

[3:52:05.120 --> 3:52:09.600]  barack obama is the tip of the spear and we've got to give them a stake
[3:52:09.600 --> 3:52:13.840]  in creating the kind of world order that i think all of us would like to see
[3:52:13.840 --> 3:52:17.120]  the obama deception completely destroys the myth
[3:52:17.120 --> 3:52:20.320]  that obama is working for the best interest of the american people
[3:52:20.320 --> 3:52:24.800]  while obama's already fudging yeah fudged since day one in this election
[3:52:24.800 --> 3:52:28.480]  if you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality
[3:52:28.480 --> 3:52:32.720]  cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme
[3:52:32.720 --> 3:52:37.920]  bankers and finance oligarchs that's fascism
[3:52:37.920 --> 3:52:41.520]  it's not about left to right it's about a one-world government
[3:52:41.520 --> 3:52:46.480]  this film documents who obama works for the lies he is told

[3:53:01.200 --> 3:53:04.960]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non
[3:53:04.960 --> 3:53:08.640]  hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know
[3:53:08.640 --> 3:53:11.920]  that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[3:53:11.920 --> 3:53:14.640]  silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even
[3:53:14.640 --> 3:53:17.920]  golden silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[3:53:17.920 --> 3:53:20.160]  again so our friends at solutions from
[3:53:20.160 --> 3:53:23.840]  science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[3:53:23.840 --> 3:53:27.360]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[3:54:11.760 --> 3:54:16.640]  warn people in my gallon what said the biggest issue is to realize they're
[3:54:16.640 --> 3:54:20.480]  not talking about killing us and all these publications they're doing it
[3:54:20.480 --> 3:54:23.440]  and you've got to face that horror and read their own statements and they've
[3:54:23.440 --> 3:54:28.320]  been caught the un's been caught the time for games is over
[3:54:28.320 --> 3:54:31.280]  get aggressive there's more of us than there are of them
[3:54:31.280 --> 3:54:34.400]  kind of the matrix dot com is alan watch website he is a big part of the new
[3:54:34.400 --> 3:54:36.800]  film fall the republic volume one hope you pre-order it
[3:54:36.800 --> 3:54:39.920]  because it's going to be shipped out the order it's received it's coming out
[3:54:39.920 --> 3:54:43.920]  in just 13 days all right let's go ahead and
[3:54:43.920 --> 3:54:47.520]  loyte in connecticut are you still there yeah i'm still here
[3:54:47.520 --> 3:54:51.200]  so you're making the point that yeah the internal people are freaking out about
[3:54:51.200 --> 3:54:55.120]  the flu go ahead you know uh when i was a kid uh my old
[3:54:55.120 --> 3:54:59.600]  old man he wouldn't let us get a shot because everybody in his neighborhood
[3:54:59.600 --> 3:55:03.280]  when he grew up took the polio vaccine and they all were they were damaged by it
[3:55:03.280 --> 3:55:06.960]  and he was terrified of it and uh i haven't
[3:55:06.960 --> 3:55:10.240]  i've never had the flu and i've never taken a shot
[3:55:10.240 --> 3:55:15.280]  so i don't really think they do anything at all i think it's just like
[3:55:15.280 --> 3:55:18.880]  smoking mirrors you know well it'd be nice if it was just a scam
[3:55:18.880 --> 3:55:22.160]  but but it actually does do something i appreciate your call
[3:55:22.160 --> 3:55:26.080]  alan briefly tell him what it does to him well it's not out from their own
[3:55:26.080 --> 3:55:30.720]  writings they admit uh the top there's thousands of of viruses they haven't
[3:55:30.720 --> 3:55:35.200]  even identified yet in every shot every shot for everything that they've ever
[3:55:35.200 --> 3:55:39.040]  given you uh and it's the recent uh
[3:55:39.040 --> 3:55:42.720]  explanation that have given out to the top but they do know that the ones they
[3:55:42.720 --> 3:55:45.920]  have given you definitely and not only can but do
[3:55:45.920 --> 3:55:50.640]  cause cancers they do destroy you well the inventor of the polio vaccine was in
[3:55:50.640 --> 3:55:54.240]  a cbc piece admitting it gave everybody cancer but it's
[3:55:54.240 --> 3:55:58.640]  but it's worth five years ago the fda approved so that in england and so to
[3:55:58.640 --> 3:56:02.720]  canada they spray live viruses in in in uh
[3:56:02.720 --> 3:56:06.480]  latin it means bacteria eating virus i can't pronounce it
[3:56:06.480 --> 3:56:11.040]  but you have pictures yeah yes but phalanges yeah but they grow in these
[3:56:11.040 --> 3:56:14.000]  big vaccine tanks with thousands of other viruses
[3:56:14.000 --> 3:56:20.160]  so they spray vaccine live vaccine on your meat now
[3:56:20.160 --> 3:56:24.640]  yeah yeah bacteria phages and actually they can kill off most bacteria
[3:56:24.640 --> 3:56:28.000]  the the soviet union didn't bother with anti-biotics because they had to
[3:56:28.000 --> 3:56:33.360]  it that bacteria phages since 1930s that was brought over that whole
[3:56:33.360 --> 3:56:36.400]  all their patents were brought over by a new york company and that would help
[3:56:36.400 --> 3:56:40.880]  them from the public uh they don't want to give us uh something that will kill
[3:56:40.880 --> 3:56:45.360]  off bacterial infections they want us to die off that's why they bought the
[3:56:45.360 --> 3:56:49.520]  static kills the good bacteria is everybody then has intestinal problems
[3:56:49.520 --> 3:56:54.640]  yeah all all done scientifically uh let's cram in one final caller here

[3:57:32.000 --> 3:57:37.120]  to to the soviet unit and it turns out that the u.s basically emptied out
[3:57:37.120 --> 3:57:40.800]  fort nox and put all their gold over to the soviets and a lot of the ships got
[3:57:40.800 --> 3:57:44.880]  sunk by the german submarines and these guys actually found some of the ships
[3:57:44.880 --> 3:57:48.960]  that were stacked with gold bricks that was kept from the public right up until
