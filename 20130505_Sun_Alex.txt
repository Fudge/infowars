[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.480 --> 00:09.580]  Waging war on corruption
[00:09.580 --> 00:35.260]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar
[00:35.260 --> 00:42.300]  It is the fifth day of May 2013 on this Sunday edition. We're going to be here, Lord willing,
[00:42.300 --> 00:51.060]  for the next two hours. And I am back in studio. And if we give the TV viewers a document cam
[00:51.060 --> 00:58.020]  shot, all of this is fresh news. And I have looked over and read about 90% of this scanned
[00:58.020 --> 01:08.440]  over the other 10% or so. And I'm really going to attempt to go over all of this here today.
[01:08.440 --> 01:13.620]  The only time that you will see me with non computer printout news articles is when I've
[01:13.620 --> 01:19.420]  been on the road. And Friday morning in Dallas before I got back to Austin, Texas, or Friday
[01:19.420 --> 01:24.780]  afternoon, I should say, I had these articles and also ran into some Saturday newspapers
[01:24.780 --> 01:31.620]  here in Austin that we're going to be getting into here today as well.
[01:31.620 --> 01:38.920]  But wow, there is so much to cover. Obviously, number one, Israel has launched a bunch of
[01:38.920 --> 01:47.820]  bombing campaigns or sorties into Syria. Syria for over 26 months has been under globalist
[01:47.820 --> 01:54.820]  attack. And again, I don't romanticize Assad. The point is he did nothing to anybody outside
[01:54.820 --> 02:00.100]  of his nation and is a benevolent dictator compared to his father.
[02:00.100 --> 02:07.580]  Just like I wasn't a fan of Hasim Mubarak of Egypt. But as dictators go, he was not
[02:07.580 --> 02:14.340]  as repressive as many and he was Western backed. And so when our government in NATO took him
[02:14.340 --> 02:20.480]  out and put something even worse in, I said, wow, man, this is really, really illustrative
[02:20.480 --> 02:24.180]  of just how ruthless the people are running our society.
[02:24.180 --> 02:32.380]  And here's the key to all this. They don't care one micron about you or I's interest
[02:32.380 --> 02:37.740]  as well. And when there's no checks and balances, when there's no protection, the bottom basically
[02:37.740 --> 02:41.940]  drops out. I run into so many people that go, well, they have to do this because you
[02:41.940 --> 02:46.820]  know, so what if they use Al Qaeda to bring down Assad, cuz Assad's bad too.
[02:46.820 --> 02:51.660]  They're bringing him down to put radicals in to destroy the country as a scorched earth
[02:51.660 --> 02:57.340]  program against innocent men, women and children. And the globalists are doing a softer form
[02:57.340 --> 03:03.980]  of that via cultural attack and agenda 21 here in the West. The New World Order might
[03:03.980 --> 03:08.900]  as well be an alien spaceship here, destroying humanity.
[03:08.900 --> 03:13.740]  It isn't an alien spaceship orbiting above us, a black pyramid, but it might as well
[03:13.740 --> 03:22.440]  be. They are absolutely committed to social Darwinism and they see you and they see me
[03:22.440 --> 03:28.980]  and everybody else and 99.9% of us not as expendable. We're already expendable as trash
[03:28.980 --> 03:29.980]  to be taken out.
[03:29.980 --> 03:35.180]  Well, you listen here New World Order on your dreams of grandeur, I guess you got your grandeur,
[03:35.180 --> 03:41.020]  your dreams of immortality and your power trip, I know who you are. And it's our job
[03:41.020 --> 03:46.500]  to show their writings and their game plan to people so that we can awaken as a species
[03:46.500 --> 03:51.180]  and defeat this. But when I was talking to Watson this morning and working on this article
[03:51.180 --> 03:56.740]  a little bit with him, we came up with a headline, Israel helps its Al Qaeda ally with attack
[03:56.740 --> 03:57.740]  on Syria.
[03:57.740 --> 04:04.040]  And you write a headline like that and it sounds so bizarre, so over the top, so weird.
[04:04.040 --> 04:09.920]  And then you realize it's 100% true and 100% public. Now, what does that say about the
[04:09.920 --> 04:15.300]  normalcy bias that the globalists know we have? They know that we'll basically put up
[04:15.300 --> 04:24.080]  with anything if for two years and three months, so 27 months total, the West, they called
[04:24.080 --> 04:30.900]  the first attacks bombings and machine gunnings protest against the evil Assad.
[04:30.900 --> 04:35.420]  That was two plus years ago, then the last year and a half it's been, we bomb and give
[04:35.420 --> 04:41.700]  missiles and weapons to the activists, to the rebels cuz Assad's a bad guy to just engage
[04:41.700 --> 04:45.820]  in every form of terrorism you can imagine. And then you don't think the West wouldn't
[04:45.820 --> 04:50.580]  hire Muslim terrorists or patsies to bomb the marathon to take our rights?
[04:50.580 --> 04:55.100]  I mean, the Syrians, I look at these men, women and children they've been killing and
[04:55.100 --> 05:00.100]  I have a lot of empathy folks cuz we're next.
[05:00.100 --> 05:04.820]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[05:04.820 --> 05:10.440]  immunity and health. At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing

[06:08.420 --> 06:15.900]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones on the GCN
[06:15.900 --> 06:29.820]  radio network.
[06:29.820 --> 06:38.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Sunday, the fifth day of May 2013 and Deep Purple is bringing
[06:38.340 --> 06:45.980]  us in today. Smoke on the water, fire in the sky. There is certainly smoke on the water
[06:45.980 --> 06:54.620]  and fire in the sky in and around Syria. Syria, the ancient country that's had Jews, Christians
[06:54.620 --> 06:59.380]  and then Muslims living in it, Jews living there for 3,000 plus years, Christians living
[06:59.380 --> 07:03.140]  there for 2,000 years or so.
[07:03.140 --> 07:08.420]  Now about a third of the country or more is under al-Qaeda control. They fly al-Qaeda
[07:08.420 --> 07:16.700]  flags, and they are being armed with heavy weapons. Heavy weapons, heavy missiles, medium
[07:16.700 --> 07:23.500]  sized artillery, grenade launchers, and anti aircraft weapons. And they have been shooting
[07:23.500 --> 07:28.740]  up aircraft trying to take off the International Airport in Damascus.
[07:28.740 --> 07:35.100]  Israel has engaged in another wave of bombings across the country, bombing military bases
[07:35.100 --> 07:43.000]  and other strategic locations. And again, ladies and gentlemen, when I sit here and
[07:43.000 --> 07:49.740]  I see this, it's like the Twilight Zone, because this is not my opinion. When Paul Watson came
[07:49.740 --> 07:52.260]  out with a headline, document can please for TV viewers.
[07:52.260 --> 07:56.820]  Again, it's a syndicated radio show, but we're streaming video at mfallwars.com, forward
[07:56.820 --> 08:05.300]  slash listen, and of course, also at prisonplanet.tv. Israel helps its al-Qaeda ally with attack
[08:05.300 --> 08:13.360]  on Syria, Tel Aviv in Bolden's western back jihadist. Now, the Council on Foreign Relations,
[08:13.360 --> 08:17.860]  the LA Times, all of them, the New York Times have had to admit, we've been reporting it
[08:17.860 --> 08:22.420]  for 26, 27 months, but over the last year, they've had to admit, yes, the West in Libya
[08:22.420 --> 08:27.140]  and now in Syria is importing actual al-Qaeda.
[08:27.140 --> 08:35.460]  People that call themselves al-Qaeda out of Saudi Arabia. I guess if Saudi Arabia is involved
[08:35.460 --> 08:39.020]  in another attack like 9-11, maybe we'll just attack Syria. I mean, this is kind of, or
[08:39.020 --> 08:47.380]  maybe Canada, that's what this has turned into. That's how stupid the corporate mainstream
[08:47.380 --> 08:52.540]  media thinks you are out there.
[08:52.540 --> 08:57.500]  And so that's our top story today. As the end of a week when the Obama administration
[08:57.500 --> 09:04.660]  signaled its intention to send heavy weaponry to al-Qaeda-led Syrian rebels, Israel launched
[09:04.660 --> 09:10.460]  airstrikes inside Syrian territory that will only serve to embolden jihadist militants
[09:10.460 --> 09:14.860]  who have openly espoused their desire to destroy both Israel and the United States.
[09:14.860 --> 09:19.740]  We have links to videos where they were in Libya a year ago or two years ago or so and
[09:19.740 --> 09:27.400]  they said with signs on BBC, next stop, Syria, next stop, Washington. And Washington is like,
[09:27.400 --> 09:32.700]  that's right, have more heat seeking missiles from Benghazi. The ambassador didn't like
[09:32.700 --> 09:36.620]  it, so he got hit.
[09:36.620 --> 09:43.180]  And they're saying, don't worry, don't worry, here's all the weapons you could ever want.
[09:43.180 --> 09:47.540]  People are saying, well, what does that mean? There's a global crime syndicate that controls
[09:47.540 --> 09:53.460]  NATO and the major Western governments and it is using al-Qaeda to overthrow secular
[09:53.460 --> 09:58.660]  governments that are not bothering anybody and are creating stability in the Middle East
[09:58.660 --> 10:01.380]  because they want divide and conquer.
[10:01.380 --> 10:05.980]  Since the time of Julius Caesar and his book, he wrote the Battle for Gaul. It's a collection
[10:05.980 --> 10:11.580]  of letters he wrote back to the regent of the Senate. They describe how to divide and
[10:11.580 --> 10:15.500]  conquer and play groups against each other. And I've talked to a lot of good old boys
[10:15.500 --> 10:19.060]  that go, yeah, we'll fund the Arabs to kill each other.
[10:19.060 --> 10:24.140]  Let me explain something to you. The globalists hate you more than they hate the Arabs. They
[10:24.140 --> 10:28.780]  hate anybody that's been sovereign, anybody that's been independent, anybody that they
[10:28.780 --> 10:35.100]  don't control. This is not America doing this. This is the global crime syndicate that has
[10:35.100 --> 10:37.300]  seized control of our government doing it.
[10:37.300 --> 10:43.180]  And they have kicked out more than 20 members of the Joint Chiefs and their adjuncts just
[10:43.180 --> 10:47.860]  in the last three years, including the head of CENTCOM repeatedly and the head of the
[10:47.860 --> 10:52.660]  Mediterranean fleet. And the list goes on because they said no to giving heat seeking
[10:52.660 --> 10:59.920]  missiles by the thousands to al-Qaeda.
[10:59.920 --> 11:04.260]  And the decision has been made at the Club of Rome and the Bilderberg Group and the Council
[11:04.260 --> 11:11.140]  on Foreign Relations and publicly in France and England and at the NATO Council and the
[11:11.140 --> 11:20.300]  UN Secretary General. The decisions have been made in Washington that you are so stupid
[11:20.300 --> 11:27.460]  that they can put al-Qaeda in Libya and Syria and al-Qaeda like give control to the Muslim
[11:27.460 --> 11:32.300]  Brotherhood created by British intelligence, taken over by Hitler, turned over to Western
[11:32.300 --> 11:36.780]  Intelligence CIA in 1946 after World War II.
[11:36.780 --> 11:44.100]  And that's what I'm telling you. Then when al-Qaeda shoots down US and European jetliners,
[11:44.100 --> 11:48.380]  we will be on the news when this happens going, hey, our government funded al-Qaeda. Here
[11:48.380 --> 11:53.060]  they are at Benghazi giving them the 10,000 plus heat seekers. It's like 18,000 missiles
[11:53.060 --> 11:58.380]  total, 10,000 heat seekers. That's been in the news. And when all this happens, it'll
[11:58.380 --> 12:06.140]  be all over the headlines. Alex Jones, the scum. Alex Jones, the garbage. Alex Jones,
[12:06.140 --> 12:11.700]  the anti-American lies and says our government gave the missiles to al-Qaeda.
[12:11.700 --> 12:16.780]  When Benghazi happened months ago, I had Wayne Madsen who's been to Libya over and over again,
[12:16.780 --> 12:24.060]  formerly with the NSA on. I had Colonel Anthony Shafer, who ran black ops in the Pentagon
[12:24.060 --> 12:28.180]  and could have killed bin Laden repeatedly but was told to stand down on the show. I
[12:28.180 --> 12:35.220]  had Webster Griffin Tarpley. I had countless experts. I had Dr. Steve Pechenik, former
[12:35.220 --> 12:39.020]  head of black ops for the State Department over the CIA.
[12:39.020 --> 12:44.700]  I had them all on and they all concurred. And Shafer made statements saying, he agreed
[12:44.700 --> 12:49.060]  it was basically looked like a hit on the ambassador. He got so much heat, he asked
[12:49.060 --> 12:54.540]  that we walk that back. We need to get him back on by the way. But the point is, is that
[12:54.540 --> 13:00.100]  here it is. Benghazi names of whistleblower witnesses revealed. So they're now trying
[13:00.100 --> 13:06.780]  to go after the whistleblowers and they now put people in jail to report federal crimes.
[13:06.780 --> 13:11.060]  Obama has done things nobody's ever done before. It's just incredible. The Benghazi talking
[13:11.060 --> 13:17.180]  points and how they were changed to obscure the truth, weekly standard. Official, CBS
[13:17.180 --> 13:19.980]  News, we knew Benghazi was terror attacked from the get go.
[13:19.980 --> 13:28.140]  They had two predator drones and a C-130 out of Italy over it the whole time it happened.
[13:28.140 --> 13:33.540]  It was on record the Al-Qaeda group. The West brought in Al-Qaeda, more than 60,000 of them,
[13:33.540 --> 13:41.020]  into Benghazi over the border of Egypt. And Mubarak wouldn't go along with this. That's
[13:41.020 --> 13:45.220]  why they took Mubarak, Hassan Mubarak, the US backed dictator 31 years out.
[13:45.220 --> 13:54.180]  See, it's a chain reaction. Egypt borders in North Africa. To the West is Libya and
[13:54.180 --> 13:58.180]  its capital Tripoli. Next to that's Tunisia. And so he wouldn't go along with that. He
[13:58.180 --> 14:02.900]  said, I'm not gonna help that. So they basically arrested him, drugged him up for the fake
[14:02.900 --> 14:07.100]  trial. He had a stroke member, that's why he couldn't be there.
[14:07.100 --> 14:11.900]  Kind of like the other Patsy bomber in Boston. Gets out of the boat, no blood. Next, his
[14:11.900 --> 14:16.700]  throat's been cut out. But he confessed to us, but you'll never hear him talk. I mean,
[14:16.700 --> 14:21.900]  just the essence of authoritarianism. And again, the globalists are running these people.
[14:21.900 --> 14:26.380]  So Mubarak says two plus years ago, I'm not part of this. Boom, he disappears, boom. They
[14:26.380 --> 14:32.380]  bring in 50 to 60,000 of these jihadis, actual Al-Qaeda, out of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, other
[14:32.380 --> 14:36.460]  areas with weapons, out of Egypt, into Libya.
[14:36.460 --> 14:40.540]  Again, no fan of Gaddafi, but he was working with the West the last eight years before
[14:40.540 --> 14:46.180]  that. It was investing his money in major Western banks, invested his money with Sarkozy.
[14:46.180 --> 14:50.220]  That's why we predicted he'd be arrested later, which they've now gone after him. So he basically
[14:50.220 --> 14:59.200]  financed Sarkozy into office. But the issue was that once they were there in Benghazi,
[14:59.200 --> 15:05.100]  it came out day one, that the group that killed him was the Benghazi security force hired
[15:05.100 --> 15:07.500]  and funded by NATO and the CIA.
[15:07.500 --> 15:13.580]  They had a weapons cache at that torture center. And so everybody on the ground, Navy SEALs
[15:13.580 --> 15:19.520]  CIA at a torture base a half mile away, they were ordered hundreds of US troops, do not
[15:19.520 --> 15:23.780]  go help. Don't leave your torture dungeon, that continued under Obama, that's now come
[15:23.780 --> 15:24.780]  out.
[15:24.780 --> 15:29.920]  Just stand down, for eight hours, they watched five security people plus two SEALs that didn't
[15:29.920 --> 15:38.380]  follow orders, hold off more than 300 Al Qaeda sent to murder the ambassador and blow the
[15:38.380 --> 15:43.060]  place up. And by the way, I told you that months ago, it's now come out mainstream news.
[15:43.060 --> 15:46.940]  Weekly Standard, CBS News, you name it, they think you're too stupid to even understand
[15:46.940 --> 15:53.540]  what you're reading. Okay, eight hours. The fleet was just 30 miles away off the coast.
[15:53.540 --> 16:00.420]  They sat there and watched it happen. Watch the whole thing.

[18:00.060 --> 18:05.580]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[18:05.580 --> 18:10.380]  and floods raged across the US, costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[18:10.380 --> 18:14.780]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[18:14.780 --> 18:19.260]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are.
[18:19.260 --> 18:24.220]  We all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control

[20:05.980 --> 20:17.180]  Alex Jones Broadcasting Network. We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex
[20:17.180 --> 20:44.180]  Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Our republic is having the globalest new world order knife
[20:44.180 --> 20:54.940]  drawn across its throat. And the general public is very childlike. And look at people. I watch
[20:54.940 --> 21:04.540]  folks in public. And they are so simple minded. They have no idea what they're facing. And
[21:04.540 --> 21:10.060]  that's why the ruling class globally is so incredibly ruthless. They've gotten away with
[21:10.060 --> 21:15.300]  so much. And now they're getting away with things that I would have thought unthinkable.
[21:15.300 --> 21:20.900]  I was thinking during the break, when has our government and other Western governments
[21:20.900 --> 21:30.180]  funded a group like Al Qaeda publicly to not fight Russian troops like the 1980s? But to
[21:30.180 --> 21:36.020]  go in and blow up mosque and blow up neighborhoods and make fathers, Christian fathers and other
[21:36.020 --> 21:41.740]  suicide bomb or they'll kill their families. I mean, that's all admitted. And attack a
[21:41.740 --> 21:48.420]  country for 26, 27 months and then say that country that lays there and takes it, Syria
[21:48.420 --> 21:52.300]  is the bad guy. I mean, they must think you're incredibly dumb.
[21:52.300 --> 21:58.700]  And I was thinking, when has our government done something that over the top naked? And
[21:58.700 --> 22:03.340]  it's Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge in the 70s. Zbigniew Brzezinski, I've read the book he
[22:03.340 --> 22:07.540]  wrote about it, bragged that the quote you could pull up something like, it would be
[22:07.540 --> 22:18.540]  unthinkable for us to kill 30% of the Cambodians, but I could fund Pol Pot to do it.
[22:18.540 --> 22:25.540]  Millions of people, just field after field of skulls, what's called the killing fields.
[22:25.540 --> 22:32.300]  Our government did that and it's on record. He's a rock star on C-SPAN when he goes to
[22:32.300 --> 22:40.260]  the CFR. They admire guys, they see that as strong, as cold blooded, as cool. And they
[22:40.260 --> 22:49.540]  took those families out and they just shot them in the head. Anyone who was educated.
[22:49.540 --> 22:52.620]  And then I thought about Madeleine Albright, and I wanna find this clip. We played it before,
[22:52.620 --> 22:55.940]  but I was telling an Esquire writer about it and he didn't believe it.
[22:55.940 --> 23:00.140]  Maybe you can even find it, John. I know we've played it like a month ago. Madeleine Albright
[23:00.140 --> 23:05.580]  talks about dead Iraqi children, or says, I mean, the actual quote on NBC Nightline,
[23:05.580 --> 23:12.360]  it was NBC Dateline, was, are 600 plus thousand dead Iraqis, most of them children from the
[23:12.360 --> 23:16.080]  sanctions and the war, this is before the second war in 2003.
[23:16.080 --> 23:19.580]  Is that a good price to pay for security in the region? And she said, yes, it is a good
[23:19.580 --> 23:28.580]  price to pay. It's a famous quote. But our government puts Saddam Hussein in power, that's
[23:28.580 --> 23:37.580]  declassified. They trained him in 1959 as a CIA agent in Egypt. He was trained for three
[23:37.580 --> 23:44.540]  years from 56 to 59.
[23:44.540 --> 23:55.300]  Look it up. The West staged a coup to put him in in 79, gave him almost $40 billion
[23:55.300 --> 24:00.560]  we know of to start a war with Iran. And you're like, well, that's how we get them Iranians.
[24:00.560 --> 24:07.260]  The globalists don't like you either. But you will go along with overthrowing the Iranian
[24:07.260 --> 24:11.560]  government in 53 and putting the Shah in, and then overthrowing him and putting the
[24:11.560 --> 24:13.900]  Muslim Shiites in.
[24:13.900 --> 24:17.460]  Yeah, that's on record. They put the Abtullah Khomeini in, then they did the Iran-Contradill
[24:17.460 --> 24:26.380]  with him a year later. Yeah, he's our enemy. I'm not saying they even work for each other.
[24:26.380 --> 24:30.340]  It's just that it's like our government gave nuclear reactors in North Korea in the mid-90s.
[24:30.340 --> 24:34.820]  ABB, Donald Rumsfeld, look it up. Clinton was involved too, bipartisan.
[24:34.820 --> 24:40.940]  It's totally cold-blooded Machiavellianism of injustifies the means. But the means isn't
[24:40.940 --> 24:44.900]  keep America free, keep America strong. That would still be immoral. That's how they get
[24:44.900 --> 24:48.740]  people to do bad things. We torture to keep America free. We've gotta be more evil than
[24:48.740 --> 24:49.740]  the evil guys.
[24:49.740 --> 24:54.740]  That's how the devil talks, folks. And I sat there this morning, and Paul was doing an
[24:54.740 --> 24:58.040]  article and I was working on with him a little bit. And he said, what do you think the headline
[24:58.040 --> 25:05.140]  ought to be? And I said, well, Israel, I said Twilight Zone, Israel backs al-Qaeda rebels
[25:05.140 --> 25:11.120]  in Syria. Well, he went with the headline, Israel helps its al-Qaeda ally with attack
[25:11.120 --> 25:12.120]  on Syria.
[25:12.120 --> 25:15.780]  He goes, well, we think Hezbollah out of Iran might have been bringing them some missiles,
[25:15.780 --> 25:20.440]  so we did this. Folks, they're blowing up military bases and killing key leadership.
[25:20.440 --> 25:23.780]  When they bombed them a few months ago, I said that, that they weren't bombing chemical
[25:23.780 --> 25:31.940]  weapons and it turned out they weren't. They were killing military leadership. Israel,
[25:31.940 --> 25:37.860]  along with NATO, see, cuz NATO is held back because the media and people are telling the
[25:37.860 --> 25:43.180]  truth. So it's so outrageous to bomb a country, plus the UN Security Council, because of Russia's
[25:43.180 --> 25:48.940]  veto, hasn't authorized this, and everybody knows about WMD lies.
[25:48.940 --> 25:56.020]  Syria legally has their WMDs, the US has them as well, chemical weapons. Syria's like, we'll
[25:56.020 --> 25:59.900]  never use these, we're sitting here letting you attack us, knowing you wanna bait us into
[25:59.900 --> 26:04.420]  a war. Assad said that two weeks ago in a speech. He said, you're using al-Qaeda against
[26:04.420 --> 26:08.540]  us, and this is gonna come back to haunt you. And he said, read the whole speech, he said,
[26:08.540 --> 26:13.020]  the American people need to know, when you get your jetliners, it's come out in leaks.
[26:13.020 --> 26:16.620]  They listen to the show, the Syrian government does. They don't even have that good of intelligence,
[26:16.620 --> 26:22.620]  cuz they're not full spectrum. It came out in British news that Assad reads infowars.
[26:22.620 --> 26:26.740]  But the point is, he came out and said, when they attack you with the missiles that you
[26:26.740 --> 26:35.980]  got, that you gave them in Libya, it's going to come back on you. And he said, American
[26:35.980 --> 26:47.980]  people, this is evil, don't be part of this. And when you read Reuters, it was headline,
[26:47.980 --> 26:51.180]  Assad says US will pay for backing al-Qaeda in Syria.
[26:51.180 --> 26:55.540]  And then the article admitted, well, we do back them, it's true, but it's for a good
[26:55.540 --> 27:01.180]  cause, but didn't give you the full transcript, go read it. That was like a week ago, two
[27:01.180 --> 27:04.700]  weeks ago. Guys, if you type in for viewers that are watching on TV and not just listening,
[27:04.700 --> 27:11.940]  type in, or for listeners, the listeners can do it. Type in, Assad says America will regret
[27:11.940 --> 27:13.420]  backing al-Qaeda in Syria.
[27:13.420 --> 27:17.460]  That's the exact headline Reuters. The point is, is that I get up here for new listeners.
[27:17.460 --> 27:23.220]  They've run national headlines the last two weeks going, Alex Jones says Obama's the head
[27:23.220 --> 27:28.140]  of al-Qaeda, how insane is that? Rachel Maddow said that and others. Well, let me just show
[27:28.140 --> 27:31.580]  you the article they reference right here that's got him so freaked out.
[27:31.580 --> 27:36.500]  Obama now global head of al-Qaeda, Paul Watson, Alex Jones, March 21st, will president order
[27:36.500 --> 27:41.580]  drone strike on White House? And we said that saying, well, he says he's launched his drone
[27:41.580 --> 27:46.300]  strikes on al-Qaeda, the truth is he runs al-Qaeda. So the article was written as a
[27:46.300 --> 27:49.860]  direct message to them that hey, come on, you know you're running al-Qaeda.
[27:49.860 --> 27:53.460]  If you wanted to go after al-Qaeda, you'd go after yourself, though we wish you a long
[27:53.460 --> 27:58.980]  healthy life. President Obama is now the global head of al-Qaeda, bankrolling, arming and
[27:58.980 --> 28:02.300]  equipping terrorists around the world in order to achieve his administration's geopolitical
[28:02.300 --> 28:06.100]  objectives, while simultaneously invoking the threat of terrorists domestically to destroy
[28:06.100 --> 28:07.100]  the Bill of Rights.
[28:07.100 --> 28:13.020]  And it goes through more than 15 links to mainstream media admitting the entire thing.
[28:13.020 --> 28:18.500]  Now there it is, Assad says West will pay for backing al-Qaeda in Syria. And what is
[28:18.500 --> 28:25.340]  that, MSNBC? Yeah, NBC News, NBC News, World News, yeah, and they ran Reuters. Okay, there
[28:25.340 --> 28:32.040]  you go, boom for TV viewers, okay? Karzai comes out and says the West is staging bombings
[28:32.040 --> 28:35.960]  and runs al-Qaeda to destabilize us, Reuters.
[28:35.960 --> 28:40.360]  Now when I come back, I wanna talk about how this is gonna affect you here at home. Because
[28:40.360 --> 28:45.220]  I predicted six months ago when they got the Benghazi, well even before they got the Benghazi
[28:45.220 --> 28:49.140]  heat seekers, they already had a bunch in Libya, the West gave it to them. The banks
[28:49.140 --> 28:55.020]  that have hijacked us, I predicted that they would start attacking the Syrian airfields,
[28:55.020 --> 29:00.540]  the civilian fields with them, they're now doing that. We're next.

[31:00.200 --> 31:05.280]  A little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a pretty
[31:05.280 --> 31:09.920]  good sized meal, that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well known fact
[31:09.920 --> 31:14.160]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[31:14.160 --> 31:19.560]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals
[31:19.560 --> 31:24.880]  and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be
[31:24.880 --> 31:30.400]  healthy. I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[33:01.340 --> 33:08.120]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[33:08.120 --> 33:13.320]  Network.
[33:13.320 --> 33:25.960]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:25.960 --> 33:31.580]  Nobody rides for free. And by the way, there's no way the global elite, no matter how much
[33:31.580 --> 33:37.360]  police state security they set up, are going to get away with what they're doing. That's
[33:37.360 --> 33:40.000]  not how the universe works.
[33:40.000 --> 33:45.800]  Their own people will bring them down. I mean, I look at the last two French presidents have
[33:45.800 --> 33:50.280]  been raided and on the verge of being indicted. I look at how they set up their other guy,
[33:50.280 --> 33:54.080]  all the stuff happening in England, all the stuff happening in America. The Rothschilds
[33:54.080 --> 33:57.500]  in so much political trouble, the Rockefellers, all of them.
[33:57.500 --> 34:04.560]  You're not going to get away with this. Nobody rides for free. What comes around goes around.
[34:04.560 --> 34:09.280]  You reap what you sow. Let me just go back to the document cam for TV viewers. Radio
[34:09.280 --> 34:12.560]  listeners can search these terms. We're gonna have open phones in the second hour and a
[34:12.560 --> 34:16.200]  bunch of news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[34:16.200 --> 34:22.920]  Osama bin Laden-like villain in Iron Man 3 portrayed as British actor. And guess what?
[34:22.920 --> 34:30.620]  Iron Man is fighting a terrorist. Isn't that just sweet? So see, every movie I go see that's
[34:30.620 --> 34:38.620]  an action movie, almost every movie, they're fighting imaginary terrorist.
[34:38.620 --> 34:45.680]  But in the real world, in the real world, not in Hollywood, the globalists are the terrorists.
[34:45.680 --> 34:52.440]  They run America and they created about 100 years ago in what is Saudi Arabia today, the
[34:52.440 --> 34:56.700]  British created the Wahhabist, created Saudi Arabia.
[34:56.700 --> 35:05.520]  Lawrence of Arabia is the story of that and put them in power. And they are now saying
[35:05.520 --> 35:10.940]  we've got to give up all our rights because of Al-Qaeda from Chechnya and Dagestan and
[35:10.940 --> 35:17.340]  these two brothers who it turns out, that's right, you didn't see the foreign press confirmed
[35:17.340 --> 35:23.960]  on CIA payroll sponsored by Zbigniew Brzezinski groups, the Jamestowns group.
[35:23.960 --> 35:29.400]  Do you know what Brzezinski talks about the strategy of tension? Use Al-Qaeda to overthrow
[35:29.400 --> 35:34.480]  other countries, then use their threat to take our rights here. It is the Brzezinski
[35:34.480 --> 35:42.640]  strategy developed in the late 1970s, a 2.0 of divide and conquer, a full spectrum dominance
[35:42.640 --> 35:44.440]  program that we're under.
[35:44.440 --> 35:48.480]  If you're mega banks, what do you do? You radicalize a terror group, you have overthrow
[35:48.480 --> 35:51.760]  countries you wanna control, but also the countries you already dominate because you
[35:51.760 --> 35:56.360]  wanna enslave the people. You don't want them getting uppity about being taxed for $85 million
[35:56.360 --> 36:02.800]  a month to give money to private offshore interest through the bailout, through QE3.
[36:02.800 --> 36:09.800]  No, no, no, so you simply use Al-Qaeda to go after them. And again, this is public,
[36:09.800 --> 36:11.480]  they just think you're so dumb.
[36:11.480 --> 36:16.860]  Here are some of the headlines, Israel helps its Al-Qaeda ally with attack on Syria. Now
[36:16.860 --> 36:21.240]  again, everybody knows I'm not even anti-Israel. I get criticized by the anti-Israel crowd
[36:21.240 --> 36:26.200]  for not just sharing the word Israel and foaming at the mouth and flopping around the ground.
[36:26.200 --> 36:31.760]  They're like, Israel attacked the USS Liberty in 1967. Yeah, I interviewed the captain and
[36:31.760 --> 36:36.520]  folks before he died. It's been partially declassified that indeed the ship was attacked
[36:36.520 --> 36:43.320]  along with the president's authorization LBJ to try to sink it, to blame it on Egypt.
[36:43.320 --> 36:48.320]  But again, I don't just hate Israel because it's Israel. This is what, I don't hate France
[36:48.320 --> 36:55.440]  cuz it's France or England. These governments are globalist run and stage false flags. Yes,
[36:55.440 --> 36:59.200]  the attack on the USS Liberty was a false flag. I've interviewed the chairman of the
[36:59.200 --> 37:04.680]  Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Moore, now dead, on record, look up the interview.
[37:04.680 --> 37:10.960]  I've interviewed the first mate, Captain McGonigal, the captain. I've interviewed probably 30
[37:10.960 --> 37:15.500]  people that survived the most decorated ship in US history. The Israelis with the jets
[37:15.500 --> 37:20.880]  and the ships could not sink it. The US aircraft carriers launched jets to protect it, were
[37:20.880 --> 37:26.520]  ordered by LBJ. They ignored McNamara, the generals, the admirals did, to you turn those
[37:26.520 --> 37:28.920]  planes down, you turn them back.
[37:28.920 --> 37:33.360]  I want that ship to the GD bottom. And I've had the admirals here that quoted it, heard
[37:33.360 --> 37:41.120]  it in that command center. Same thing happened at Benghazi, just tying up loose ends, tying
[37:41.120 --> 37:50.200]  up loose ends. This is war, ladies and gentlemen, it's corrupt war. You ever heard of a gambit?
[37:50.200 --> 37:56.720]  It's an ancient Persian chess move, 3,000 plus years old, where again, you've got 100,000
[37:56.720 --> 37:58.720]  enemy you're about to fight.
[37:58.720 --> 38:02.460]  You believe your force can beat them, but you need to get the enemy to show itself,
[38:02.460 --> 38:07.760]  its numbers, you need intelligence. You send in 100, 200, 300 horsemen to ride into the
[38:07.760 --> 38:14.200]  midst to be destroyed, and they follow orders, they ride in to be killed. And the military
[38:14.200 --> 38:20.440]  says, why should we be the ones that die in gambits? Let Americans die, and they've gotten
[38:20.440 --> 38:23.520]  our military to go along with it a few times, but more and more they don't.
[38:23.520 --> 38:31.400]  Fox Fallon in 2007, the head of CENTCOM refused to have US Navy SEALs. This came out in New
[38:31.400 --> 38:38.880]  Yorker magazine, Cy Hirsch, two times Pulitzer Prize winner. Cheney reportedly ordered the
[38:38.880 --> 38:45.520]  Navy to build PT boats that look like Iranian boats to attack a US destroyer and blow it
[38:45.520 --> 38:46.520]  up.
[38:46.520 --> 38:51.560]  And to have Navy SEALs take the mission and then dive out at the last minute. Reportedly,
[38:51.560 --> 39:00.640]  George Bush said no. Bet you didn't hear about that in your local paper. It came out in New
[39:00.640 --> 39:04.040]  Yorker magazine, Cy Hirsch gave a speech at the university about it. This is the type
[39:04.040 --> 39:10.520]  of stuff that adults know about. Adults don't go watch Iron Man and believe that we're really
[39:10.520 --> 39:12.480]  fighting terrorists.
[39:12.480 --> 39:17.540]  Adults know how the world really works. We are captured by foreign banking institutions.
[39:17.540 --> 39:22.000]  They haven't gotten our guns yet. Upwards of 150,000 just rallied in Houston for the
[39:22.000 --> 39:29.160]  Second Amendment. US today spun the number to 80,000. I've got the article right here.
[39:29.160 --> 39:33.280]  We are on the march, the empire's on the run politically, but they're still in control
[39:33.280 --> 39:40.760]  of Washington in both parties. And Obama is their champion quarterback, leading them down
[39:40.760 --> 39:44.120]  the field against us.
[39:44.120 --> 39:51.040]  Yep, there it is, preparing the battlefield. The Bush administration steps up its secret
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.320]  moves against Iran. July 7th of 2008, a year after it happened, the plan to attack our
[39:57.320 --> 40:01.360]  own PT boats. I believe that's the correct article you guys pulled up. I know there's
[40:01.360 --> 40:07.320]  video of him saying it too. I mean, this is Pulitzer Prize winner, two times.
[40:07.320 --> 40:13.120]  Now let's be adults here. I'm gonna get into what they're gonna do to us in the next segment
[40:13.120 --> 40:18.040]  and how they're gonna take our rights. Since I mentioned it, here's that USA Today NRA
[40:18.040 --> 40:23.160]  rally in Houston, a big draw, 80,000. But before I get into what they're gonna do to
[40:23.160 --> 40:35.660]  us, I wanna show you some more history from the May edition of Infowars magazine.
[40:35.660 --> 40:40.000]  Why government should be the first suspect in any terror attack or criminal groups within
[40:40.000 --> 40:46.200]  the government by Kurt Nemo and Paul Watson. Nero and the Great Fire of Rome, firebombing
[40:46.200 --> 40:50.720]  his own city to blame it on the Christians. The Spanish American War, remember the main,
[40:50.720 --> 40:53.280]  blowing up the main to start the Spanish American War.
[40:53.280 --> 40:59.340]  1898, William McKinley. Wilson's pretext for war, the sinking of the Lusitania. Hitler's
[40:59.340 --> 41:04.200]  fascist dictatorship, the Reichstag fire, firebombing his own capital. Prelude to war,
[41:04.200 --> 41:09.240]  how do you attack Poland? He didn't just attack Poland. This is declassified, his own soldiers
[41:09.240 --> 41:13.040]  and Operation Himmler at Gleiwitz and other areas attacked their own bases.
[41:13.040 --> 41:17.560]  And they even dressed up concentration camp victims in Polish and German uniforms with
[41:17.560 --> 41:24.640]  bullet holes in them to show on the newsreels. Israeli false flag terror, the LaVon affair,
[41:24.640 --> 41:28.720]  staging terror attacks to blame it on their enemies, that's declassified. This is all
[41:28.720 --> 41:33.480]  the Jerusalem Post, by the way. Operation Northwoods targeting American citizens, ABC
[41:33.480 --> 41:34.480]  News.
[41:34.480 --> 41:38.600]  The plan to shoot up movie theaters, people on the streets and have plastic explosive
[41:38.600 --> 41:43.200]  bombs and public events as a pretext to take American liberty and have war with the Soviet
[41:43.200 --> 41:47.200]  Union. Kennedy said no, they blew his head off. Gulf of Tonkin, phantom attack on the
[41:47.200 --> 41:55.560]  US military. That's declassified. Declassified 2004, they staged fake attacks on the ships
[41:55.560 --> 42:00.800]  to launch Vietnam War. Operation Gladio, state-sponsored terror, blame on the left. Hundreds of bombings
[42:00.800 --> 42:02.960]  in Europe, blame on the left.
[42:02.960 --> 42:06.200]  Every time somebody gets a little uppity, they don't control, left or right, blow something
[42:06.200 --> 42:10.120]  up, blame it on them. Government would never do a frame up. Terror in the modern age, back
[42:10.120 --> 42:15.720]  to the document cam, please, 93 World Trade Center bombing. On record, New York Times,
[42:15.720 --> 42:19.120]  CBS News, government cooked the bomb, trained the drivers, let them do it. Underwear bomber,
[42:19.120 --> 42:23.160]  drugged up, put on plane by US government. C-SPAN reported it after we broke it. Boston
[42:23.160 --> 42:25.480]  bombing goes through the same evidence.
[42:25.480 --> 42:29.480]  Got my stamp from Martin Springs there today. It says paradise, fear of TV viewer. People
[42:29.480 --> 42:35.120]  are probably gonna ask, what's that stamp on your arm? Not a tattoo, folks. Okay, boom.
[42:35.120 --> 42:42.240]  Let's go to the next one here. So that's what's in the May issue of the magazine. And by the
[42:42.240 --> 42:45.760]  way, something else is in it, something we've never done before. I'll tell you about that
[42:45.760 --> 42:49.800]  on the other side. Then I'll get into what they're gonna do to you with the Muslim extremist
[42:49.800 --> 42:53.640]  terrorists they run. See, they say, I say there aren't any Muslim terrorists. Oh, no,
[42:53.640 --> 42:58.120]  they are. And they work for six big banks, six big banks.
[42:58.120 --> 43:05.080]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[43:05.080 --> 43:09.760]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[43:09.760 --> 43:12.400]  It really says that the state is God.
[43:12.400 --> 43:16.960]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[43:16.960 --> 43:22.520]  on Earth. This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps
[43:22.520 --> 43:27.960]  now being expanded nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[43:27.960 --> 43:32.600]  has established an all powerful shadow state. Police state four chronicles the sickening
[43:32.600 --> 43:38.000]  depth to which our republic has fallen. Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency
[43:38.000 --> 43:44.000]  dictatorship, body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on
[43:44.000 --> 43:49.080]  every street corner. It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan. The
[43:49.080 --> 43:55.600]  police state isn't coming. It's here. Secure your copy today at info wars dot com or see

[48:04.200 --> 48:12.700]  electric spy in the sky watching us, all telephone calls are recorded and accessible to the government
[48:12.700 --> 48:20.400]  according to FBI whistleblower and other guests on CNN. Yes, I've been telling you that for
[48:20.400 --> 48:21.400]  18 years.
[48:21.400 --> 48:26.400]  It's a fact. It was declassified a long time ago, but you don't want to tell the sheep
[48:26.400 --> 48:32.240]  all that. I've interviewed the former FBI whistleblowers like Cebel Edmonds who heard
[48:32.240 --> 48:39.500]  them commanding Al-Qaeda and bin Laden before, on, and after 9-11. And they put a national
[48:39.500 --> 48:43.800]  security gag order on that lady, which she just broke. Which good thing she broke it
[48:43.800 --> 48:47.640]  before Obama got in cuz she's arresting everybody that breaks it.
[48:47.640 --> 48:52.520]  Now, this is not a plug, not that it's bad to make money. That's how I built this media

[49:06.120 --> 49:10.480]  fearlessly in the face of the globalist. I say, it's not bad to make money cuz they had
[49:10.480 --> 49:14.840]  a bunch of news articles going, how dare Alex Jones have this media operation.
[49:14.840 --> 49:19.320]  Well, at least I'm not like Berkshire Hathaway getting its money off government bailouts.
[49:19.320 --> 49:24.960]  I'm gonna cover that in the next hour. That's out of Reuters. No, no, we're funded by people
[49:24.960 --> 49:30.580]  like you, whether it's Infowars.com coffee mugs or the seed center, the best non-GMO,
[49:30.580 --> 49:37.920]  open pollinated, the very best non-GMO, non-hybrid, open pollinated seeds that produce seeds again.

[49:50.880 --> 49:52.480]  fund this operation and watch us grow.
[49:52.480 --> 49:56.680]  I wanna thank everyone that has helped us out there in the media. Citizens, we're all
[49:56.680 --> 50:03.840]  in this together. 888-253-3139, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. You can call and ask
[50:03.840 --> 50:11.360]  questions or order your propure, your seeds to plant, the bumper stickers, you name it.
[50:11.360 --> 50:17.400]  Speaking of bumper stickers, what is in the new Infowars May issue? This is a very special
[50:17.400 --> 50:22.200]  issue. Number one, it's a double cover. It says a history of false flags on the front
[50:22.200 --> 50:27.160]  and as the FBI and CIA, as a skeleton running across the finish line of the Boston bombing
[50:27.160 --> 50:31.120]  on the back detailing a history of stage terror and the evidence that points towards them
[50:31.120 --> 50:36.280]  bare minimum protecting terrorists on CIA payroll.
[50:36.280 --> 50:40.480]  Bare minimum, they're double agents. And by the way, that's Israeli news saying that,
[50:40.480 --> 50:50.000]  look it up. So there you have it. Now on the inside, it's 60 color glossy pages that covers
[50:50.000 --> 51:00.280]  the entire field. Letters to the editor, incredible art dealing with the police state. A mother
[51:00.280 --> 51:06.920]  sues NYPD for pepper spraying babies, US households on food stamps reaches record highs with all
[51:06.920 --> 51:07.920]  the graphs.
[51:07.920 --> 51:14.240]  Is the Boston bombing the moral equivalent of drone strikes? I love these photos. I actually
[51:14.240 --> 51:18.400]  hate it, but I love to expose it. Nazi Germany checkpoints with the police with the military
[51:18.400 --> 51:22.800]  checking IDs. Boston, the police and military checking IDs. Don't you believe the Nazis
[51:22.800 --> 51:24.560]  said they had a good reason?
[51:24.560 --> 51:29.680]  If history repeated itself, would anyone notice? We've got retired army colonel warns DHS acquisitions
[51:29.680 --> 51:36.440]  are bold threat of war against the American people. Why government should be the first
[51:36.440 --> 51:42.100]  suspect in any terror attack, already covered that. What's a false flag? One of the top
[51:42.100 --> 51:45.440]  search terms on the web, we've write down what a false flag is.
[51:45.440 --> 51:52.180]  It passes Monsanto Protection Act, granting Monsanto power over US government. I show
[51:52.180 --> 51:58.880]  the art of David Horsey in the LA Times demonizing me, and then I show what a sheeple he is.
[51:58.880 --> 52:02.240]  We need to put that on Infowars.com, that hadn't been on the web yet. By the way, sign
[52:02.240 --> 52:07.120]  up at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter. Tomorrow we'll send this out, the digital
[52:07.120 --> 52:13.680]  copy of the magazine to you free. A big keep and bear arms come and take it poster in the
[52:13.680 --> 52:21.520]  middle two pages, growing against the flow, different systems to get off the grid.
[52:21.520 --> 52:24.720]  People creating their own ammo factories to get around the shortage, I'm gonna cover that
[52:24.720 --> 52:28.680]  next hour. It's actually linked on drugsreport.com, how the government's asking all the big ammo
[52:28.680 --> 52:33.240]  manufacturers to just supply everything they can manufacture to them. What's causing the
[52:33.240 --> 52:35.640]  panic Obama?
[52:35.640 --> 52:42.360]  We get into Obama and all of his secret police activities. We get into 85% of cops say gun
[52:42.360 --> 52:47.320]  control is useless, detrimental and a new major study that's out with all the drafts.
[52:47.320 --> 52:52.580]  We get into the drill they were running on the day of the bombing, which they don't want
[52:52.580 --> 52:56.780]  anybody to look at, was one of the top stories on the web for a whole week. Contractors at
[52:56.780 --> 53:01.000]  Boston bombing stood near bomb, let before detonation, photos of them. And here's the
[53:01.000 --> 53:04.120]  big one, I'm gonna stop talking about the magazine, there's a whole another half of
[53:04.120 --> 53:05.440]  it to get to.
[53:05.440 --> 53:11.960]  Three free full size petroleum based, not the little paper ones. This cost me 40 grand
[53:11.960 --> 53:16.840]  to do this, put this in 120,000 magazines. So that's like 400, I don't know, it comes
[53:16.840 --> 53:23.880]  up to like 300, 400, I think 110,000 or maybe more magazines we printed. I forget the exact
[53:23.880 --> 53:34.960]  number, it's over 110,000 times three, that's 330, 340,000 bumper stickers, infowars.com,
[53:34.960 --> 53:42.200]  Save the Constitution, prisonplanet.com and infowars.com, big stickers. Post them on your
[53:42.200 --> 53:45.920]  car, your house, your property, your book bag, give them to friends and family, but
[53:45.920 --> 53:48.840]  put them on your property, not other people's property.
[53:48.840 --> 53:52.800]  And this will be explosive, the average bumper sticker in a major city, the estimate has
[53:52.800 --> 54:04.080]  seen like 20,000 times. So again, ladies and gentlemen, the key here is to get active.
[54:04.080 --> 54:09.240]  Will we save the world by putting these 300 something thousand bumper stickers out? No,
[54:09.240 --> 54:16.140]  but laying down we won't save the world. That's my point here, is that acting like jellyfish
[54:16.140 --> 54:24.640]  is going to fully and totally enslave this population to the highest level that this
[54:24.640 --> 54:28.000]  society has ever seen.
[54:28.000 --> 54:35.880]  And if we have a government that is funding Al-Qaeda and using it to engage in open war
[54:35.880 --> 54:43.800]  crimes, attacking countries that haven't done anything to anybody, do any of you think you're
[54:43.800 --> 54:49.040]  safe? They are already moving in Europe to take people's pension funds, they already
[54:49.040 --> 54:51.360]  are actually, and to take their bank accounts.
[54:51.360 --> 54:59.480]  It's now starting here, congressional hearings about doing it. This is the type of over the
[54:59.480 --> 55:06.720]  top tyranny that we're talking about. Now, talking about where all this is going in America,
[55:06.720 --> 55:12.480]  I just showed you the article where on CNN, FBI agents admit everything you do is listened
[55:12.480 --> 55:14.920]  to in live time without warrants.
[55:14.920 --> 55:19.600]  Totally illegal, but now they think you're so conditioned, they just admit it. And notice
[55:19.600 --> 55:26.800]  it didn't protect you. 2000 police, 400 National Guard, contractors with black backpacks right
[55:26.800 --> 55:37.520]  where the bombing goes off, didn't protect you. But meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen,
[55:37.520 --> 55:40.800]  we have tens of thousands that drowned a year.
[55:40.800 --> 55:43.680]  We have hundreds of thousands that die in car wrecks, hundreds of thousands that die
[55:43.680 --> 55:47.960]  from flesh eating bacteria, but the media doesn't hype it up and go ooga booga. Look
[55:47.960 --> 55:57.160]  at these articles, shiny dog bowl blamed in Santa Rosa fire. It was like a lens and supposedly
[55:57.160 --> 55:58.160]  caught a fire.
[55:58.160 --> 56:02.500]  The answer is ban the dog bowl. You've got to have a world free of risk. And only a total
[56:02.500 --> 56:05.840]  government with total surveillance can do that. Of course, history shows it'll be the
[56:05.840 --> 56:11.200]  total threat. Five women in their 30s killed on a night out after they became trapped inside
[56:11.200 --> 56:15.260]  their burning limo from an electrical fire on San Francisco highway.
[56:15.260 --> 56:21.480]  The answer, ban limos, ban fires, ban gasoline. Shouldn't be able to be trusted with gasoline.
[56:21.480 --> 56:25.000]  Somebody might get gasoline and go out and burn somebody's house down. That's the nanny
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  state idea.
[56:26.000 --> 56:35.600]  Soccer referee punched by player in Utah dies. The answer is amputate all arms. The answer
[56:35.600 --> 56:45.160]  is cut everyone's arms off now. That is the answer. And then Kurt Nemo getting serious
[56:45.160 --> 56:55.080]  as another article up on infowars.com. We have some breaking news. Israel strikes Syria,
[56:55.080 --> 56:57.640]  says targeting Hezbollah arms.
[56:57.640 --> 57:03.600]  Is that new? They've been striking them all day. They're striking them again. Yeah, Syria
[57:03.600 --> 57:08.560]  can't have its own arms in its own country while the West invades out of three different
[57:08.560 --> 57:15.260]  nations out of Turkey. And of course, out of Jordan, incredible. So more airstrikes
[57:15.260 --> 57:16.260]  going on there.
[57:16.260 --> 57:20.960]  And now I haven't even gotten into the fact that the Patsy, that they are busy blaming
[57:20.960 --> 57:25.240]  the one they cut the throat out of, so he couldn't talk. But they said, admitted he
[57:25.240 --> 57:30.800]  did it when he was in custody, but no witnesses. In a free country, you don't do that. Why
[57:30.800 --> 57:37.440]  even have trials? They are now saying he won't even have counsel at his trial.
[57:37.440 --> 57:42.280]  So they could arrest me, say I bombed something, cut my throat out, and then just say Alex
[57:42.280 --> 57:50.960]  confesses to it. That's what North Korea does. We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[57:50.960 --> 57:55.320]  I had tried everything. I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating. I was lifting weights
[57:55.320 --> 58:00.440]  and jogging, but nothing was working. My body was literally starving for minerals and trace
[58:00.440 --> 58:05.920]  elements as well as key vitamins. And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half
[58:05.920 --> 58:09.360]  of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[58:09.360 --> 58:13.080]  Now there are hundreds of great products at info worst team dot com, but I want to point
[58:13.080 --> 58:20.920]  out the three that have helped me lose thirty seven pounds in just two months. Products
[58:20.920 --> 58:26.640]  like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollenburst and Rebound. When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine
[58:26.640 --> 58:31.320]  and other products every day, I lost more than thirty seven pounds in just two months.
[58:31.320 --> 58:37.120]  Now that's results. I want to challenge my listeners to go to info wars team dot com
[58:37.120 --> 58:41.600]  and to order just three of their products. And you will see the changes in the way you

[59:53.540 --> 01:00:02.880]  from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network. From his central
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:09.920]  Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues. It's Alex Jones
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:17.420]  and the GCN Radio Network. All right, I'm going to take calls in this segment and I'm
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:21.800]  going to get into more news in the next and then more calls for the balance of the broadcast.
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.600]  But I want to get into what they're going to do under this. Oh, don't worry, the NDAA
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:31.920]  is not for citizens, even though it is. And we'll never not let you have a trial. And
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:36.080]  now they're like, we'll give him a trial. Just just no counsel. And he confessed while
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.560]  his throat was cut out while sedated. We have no proof of that, just the Boston Globe says
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:41.560]  so.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:48.880]  In fact, I know you gave that to me, CJ, but I can't find it. Will you reprint me? It was
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:01:00.360]  a Boston bomber confesses to bombing. And I've got USA Today, it says the Boston bomber.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:06.960]  Not the suspect, not the man on trial. I mean, they told us he did it. And they never lied
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:12.720]  to us. I mean, we're going to burn down Dorners. The building he was in and then they burned
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.960]  it down and said, we didn't ever said that, and we're like, but you have the tape.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:20.580]  Well, we don't mean burn it down. Now go back to sleep. Pay me some tax money, scum. Take
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:25.880]  some vaccines. How sick's your family right now? Let's go to Andrew in Pennsylvania, then
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:31.960]  Terry, Mark, Truthinator, Annette, Creed, Ben, Jason, Peter, Ramon, Aaron, Sam, we'll
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:35.880]  get to all of you, probably. Andrew, PA, you're on the air.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:42.000]  Hi, Alex. I'm currently in the process of trying to solve world peace problems. And
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:45.360]  you may have heard consciousness experts like Dave Wilcott, Craig Braden, and even David
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:49.400]  Eich have talked about how if you can get a lot of people meditating together, it will
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:54.080]  suppress global evil. So if we can get the square root of 1% of the global population
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:59.600]  that's about 8,485 people meditating together, we can suppress global evil.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.440]  And I've actually sent out a lot of messages on Planet Infowars, on the missions about
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.240]  a dozen or so groups to see this. And is there any way maybe you might be able to help me
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:13.800]  out here like for a 10-minute meditation on July 4th from like 5 to 5, 10 PM to try to-
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:19.120]  Hey, hey, even if you call it prayer or whatever, all the major studies have been pulled up.
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:24.560]  Maybe anybody can pull them up, that praying has helped with cancer, people praying. Well,
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.440]  because what you focus on, you then tend to manifest. You can call it magic, whatever
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:36.560]  you want. It's real. They've all these university studies about people do have that sixth sense.
[01:02:36.560 --> 01:02:40.320]  Now, I think there's a lot of quacks out there. I don't think it's very controllable. I've
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.800]  had a lot of dreams that come true. I don't really get off into all that stuff. But I
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:51.080]  think focusing and meditating on solutions, and then taking action in the third dimension,
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:53.800]  in the real world as we call it.
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:03:00.240]  I think that's where the real power is, taking that first step, getting this magazine. Say
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:04.840]  Austin has 60,000 copies on the street for free right now. Put those stickers up all
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:10.940]  over the place. Wow, that'll get some prayer going. New World War will be praying. But
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:15.640]  look, they are scared of you praying, or meditating, whatever you wanna call it.
[01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.900]  That's why they say there is no God, there is no God. And then all they do is meditate
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:26.040]  or pray, if you wanna call it that. And then try to have big events to tell you a lie to
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.840]  scare you. See, people think I'm trying to scare them. No, I'm trying to show you the
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:32.280]  evil to know that we can be empowered and beat them.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:38.440]  But I have learned believing you can win, just believing is half the battle. Now, trust
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:42.600]  in God but row away from the rocks. Trust in God but type your camel is the better one
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:49.120]  said. We need to pray, or even if you don't believe in God, sit in a room, get quiet,
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.000]  turn off everything else, think about the world, cuz they wanna get us so sped up, moving
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.200]  so fast.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:04:02.640]  We never pull back. And I think pulling back, yes, I will support you that on July 4th,
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.960]  we should put an article out about this. July 4th should be a day of reflection, a day of
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:11.960]  prayer, a day of meditation, whatever you call it. A day of repenting for not doing
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:17.160]  enough to fight evil and not being active in the real world and letting evil be active.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.600]  Evil has been active, good has been inactive. There are multiple forces in the universe.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:27.560]  We need to be, there's evil, there's good, the lukewarm don't exist, God spits it out.
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:32.920]  So I say to you, yes, brother, July 4th, a day of reflection, how's that sound?
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:36.920]  Yeah, but the key is if you didn't have all the people doing at the same time because
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:41.480]  energy flows where attention goes, as David Eich always says, it does amplify the ability
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:45.520]  and that's why I was telling you a specific time like 5, 10 p.m. Eastern time would be
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:46.520]  a, I thought-
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:51.480]  Hey, the Bible says if the people will pray and seek my face and repent, I will heal their
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:56.360]  land. And I think July 4th should be a day of prayer, a day of reflection, a day of meditation.
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.800]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:04.960]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011,
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:10.040]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:14.480]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:19.000]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is you are,
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.960]  we all are. Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:28.880]  mother nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability
[01:05:28.880 --> 01:05:33.360]  of your food supply with eFoods Direct. Be prepared before you need it with nutrient-dense
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.200]  food you can store for up to 25 years. You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:42.080]  you. Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best, durable foods out there from

[01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:11.760]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:24.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show. You know, I desperately want to believe that America
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:30.160]  hasn't been taken over to a great extent by foreign mega banks, hell bent on bankrupting
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:39.200]  our free market system and creating a monopoly control grid. But unfortunately, the facts
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:43.720]  show that is what is happening. I want to cover news in this segment and then when we
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:49.380]  start the next segment, I'll go to Andrew and Sam and I don't know 12 other people that
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:53.200]  are patiently holding on the phone system right now.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:59.680]  The toll free number when you hear somebody hang up to call in is 877-789-ALEX. Again,
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:06.200]  that's 877-789-2539. We'll get you up and on the air. The news websites are prisonplanet.com.
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:10.840]  That's the auxiliary backup clone but it has some original news of infowars.com and we
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:17.600]  stream video and have the subscription service at prisonplanet.tv and infowarsnews.com.
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:26.560]  Okay, so our government is violating the entire Bill of Rights Constitution. And if they can
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.780]  do that, why shouldn't they take our bank accounts? Why shouldn't they take our guns?
[01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:36.760]  Why shouldn't they put the military on the streets? Why shouldn't they spy on us without
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:42.080]  warrants? And the answer is that is what they're doing. And I've got a report coming up at
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:43.920]  the end of the show.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:47.480]  With Boston residents interviewed, we went out and talked to people in Boston. Almost
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:53.680]  no one liked police coming to their house, pointing guns at them, shoving them downstairs.
[01:07:53.680 --> 01:07:57.920]  And then they didn't even catch the guy, it was a citizen that did, the patsy. This has
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:03.200]  never been done before. You can say, well, everyone's a terror suspect. Isn't that perfect
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.200]  to take power?
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:08.040]  How about there's one terrorist in America? So everybody come outside with your hands
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:14.840]  up. This is about the bureaucrats being rock stars that run our lives. And for narcissist
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:20.520]  nobodies, they think making you submit to them is the act of power. A highly developed
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:25.040]  person is the opposite. A highly developed person wants to go off and be by themselves
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:29.880]  generally. And that is the problem, isn't it?
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:34.920]  Winners wanna be left alone and be by themselves and are confident. Losers wanna run everything.
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:38.640]  And am I saying that all cops are losers? No, a lot of cops got in it because their
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:45.240]  families have been warriors. It's a historical thing and they don't like bad guys. When I
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:51.200]  was young and naive 18, I thought about being a cop cuz I wanted to get bad guys.
[01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:55.400]  My dad had a friend who was the head of the federal marshal for the region over Texas.
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.560]  He met with me and he said, you're not a criminal, are you? And I said, no. And he goes, then
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.480]  don't join, don't become a cop. He goes, when I first joined, it wasn't totally criminal,
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:09.840]  now it is. That was at my dad's office, in his office. Head of the federal marshals at
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:12.080]  that time, about 1993.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:18.720]  He looked up whatever region Texas and others are and that was the guy. I mean, that's part
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:24.240]  of my awakening right there. So I get people out there that wanna be like, we'll watch
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:28.280]  Iron Man and believe you're really fighting Al-Qaeda when you join the police force. But
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:31.720]  listen, the government's been captured at the top, okay?
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:38.080]  Now, we can change things if you wake up to that. But if you don't, just when all the
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.840]  rest of the stuff comes true, I've told you about, then stand up. Of course, it'll be
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:45.840]  a lot worse and a lot harder then. But I mean, look how much has already come true.
[01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:52.520]  When are you gonna wake up? I mean, look, they bought 2.2 billion bullets in the last
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:57.800]  19 months. And for the first year we reported on it, it was just 500 million, a billion
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:02.640]  bullets, a billion six. They would go, Alex, you said 500 million, a billion, a billion
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.640]  six.
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:08.800]  Which is it? Knowing I can't respond that well, you go to the first report I did and
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:13.200]  then a year later, it's 1.6. You act like I'm giving different numbers. Boy, you think
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:21.240]  your audience are idiots. Now it's 2.2 billion last time, a few months ago, I haven't added
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.240]  it up yet.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:26.240]  Now DHS, this is linked on DrudgeReport.com, the left-hand side, at least it was when I
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:29.160]  started the show. Can we check that and click it? I say that cuz it's already rolling up
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:34.160]  the front page of Infowars.com. I'm told it's been up since Friday at TipToDrudgeReport.com.
[01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:45.720]  DHS seeks millions more rounds of ammunition. Market survey asked companies if they can
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.720]  provide 2 million bullets within 30 to 60 days.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:54.640]  And I looked this up and I called when I saw this Friday, a big ammo manufacturer I know,
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:00.480]  and I'm not gonna even say where. The point is I called them and they said, well, don't
[01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:06.720]  save from me, but yeah, we got the call. And we got the prospectus emailed to us. So they're
[01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:10.520]  wanting to know if they can buy up no matter what gets made, they're gonna put orders in
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:11.520]  for it.
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:16.200]  Okay, it's called cornering the market while getting enough ammo, it's like to fight a
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:22.840]  35 year plus war in Iraq, it was 27. So yeah, it's still linked on Drudge. Big sis seeks
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:26.080]  millions more rounds. Now let's go to the top of DrudgeReport.com and show the breaking
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:31.400]  news. We posted this this morning when it was speculation, Drudge now posted it when
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:32.400]  it's confirmed.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:38.400]  We go to the top of DrudgeReport.com, please. There it is, Syria, Israeli strike declaration
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:47.160]  of war, let's click on it. Reuters, Israeli strike, Syria says targeting Hezbollah arms,
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:52.600]  and then Syria says it is an act of war. It is an act of war. And again, I don't support
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:59.520]  Assad, another corrupt politician. But compared to other, Al-Qaeda, he's a good guy. I'm not
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.180]  against Israel, a lot of Israelis are against this.
[01:12:03.180 --> 01:12:10.520]  But this is evil to take out Syria to put Al-Qaeda in, let's not exaggerate. Al-Qaeda's
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:15.600]  probably about 500 times worse than Assad. I mean, Al-Qaeda, and folks, we've posted
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:19.360]  these articles, we've posted these videos, had them censored on our YouTube channels.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:23.400]  We even posted it on our backup channels, we got like ten of them, and they gave us
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.860]  a strike. Next, they're gonna shut the channel down. I mean, they're cutting Christians'
[01:12:27.860 --> 01:12:30.840]  heads off, they're lining families up and shooting them.
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.940]  They're in control of one-third of the country. NATO, Obama announced Friday, they're giving
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:41.680]  them heavy arms, cuz in two years, they haven't been able to beat them. I mean, this is hardcore
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:49.040]  crime. And now Israel attacks, and I have to have the headline, Israel backs Al-Qaeda
[01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.840]  in Syria, it's true.
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:57.520]  I would lie to you if I didn't tell you that. And it makes me wonder, what will they do
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:13:02.840]  next? I mean, this is getting so crazy. Well, I'll tell you what they'll do next. They're
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:09.940]  gonna use this new war coming up as a political distraction. There's business insider, the
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:13.960]  US is openly sending heavy weapons to the Syrian rebels.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:22.440]  Bazookas, heat-seeking missiles, my God. My God, and when I wanna fly somewhere, they'll
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.440]  try to grab my daughters and my son and drag them off to a private area and have some weird
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:31.800]  potbelly guy with a mustache grab their genitals. Looking for bin Laden in their pants, when
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.400]  bin Laden is in the Pentagon's rear end.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:39.960]  I mean, I'm sorry, that's where he is. You wanna find him, TSA, do a proctology exam
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:45.560]  on Senator Hagel, the SecDef, and you will, there it is. US rethinks arming Syrian rebels,
[01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:53.000]  says Chuck Hagel. That was a month ago. And they're always playing these mind games, man.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.400]  Like Obama said two weeks ago, we're not gonna arm the rebels. And I said, they're arming
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.760]  them already and get ready for the war.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:03.520]  When Obama says I won't sign the NDAA to secretly disappear American citizens, I said he will
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:08.320]  sign it. Turned out he wrote it and he did sign it. They do that to make you go to sleep.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:13.520]  I won't spy on you. I don't wanna take your guns. Bloomberg says he supports the Second
[01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:18.920]  Amendment when he's for an open total ban. I've learned their tricks, man. When they
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:22.360]  say they're zigging, they're zagging, nine times out of ten.
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:27.880]  I mean, they lie when the truth would serve them better because they don't wanna tell
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:34.800]  the truth because they're of their father. You know who he is? He wears a red jumpsuit
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.640]  with little horns and a pitchfork. I wish he did, it'd be more easy to see.
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.560]  Now, you wanna know what's coming to America? Here it is. The new normal Boston bombing
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:47.320]  suspect interrogated without counsel. And they reported the Boston Globe. He confessed
[01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:53.000]  while sedated, and we're just supposed to trust the government. And the new president
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.520]  said, well, he's a terrorist, he doesn't deserve it.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:59.600]  Folks, they could say anybody's a terrorist. The government has got car bombings going
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:04.400]  off and using Al-Qaeda all over Syria. They'll kill a bunch of innocent Syrians, who I'll
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:09.720]  assure you, they respect a lot more than you. The globalists hate Americans more than anybody
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:13.120]  in the world. Once they get rid of the Bill of Rights Constitution, it's all for you.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:20.520]  Of course, I told you that 11 years ago. Now they say, number one terror threat, gun owners,
[01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:24.560]  returning veterans, Christians, conservatives, libertarians. And here it is, people wonder
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:29.840]  why we're upset about the track team in Texas winning the championship regionals pointing
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:31.880]  up to God's number one.
[01:15:31.880 --> 01:15:37.040]  You can pump your fist, that's okay. US Army labeled evangelical and Catholics examples
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:42.000]  of religious extremism, Fox News. Pentagon religious proselytizing is not permitted.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.600]  Even saying the name Jesus, you will now be court-martialed. High school track team disqualified
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:53.880]  when runners gestures thanks God. It's all part of selective enforcement. Homeland Security
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:16:01.400]  is run by foreign banks in their own words. It's a takeover, a foreign corporate takeover.
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:06.460]  Effective health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the

[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:51.440]  in robots per state to fight a threat they manufactured. Now again, they're now saying,
[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:56.920]  hey, you don't get lawyers, we'll just say you're guilty and tell the media you confessed.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:00.660]  And in the past, you wouldn't get a conviction with that, but they don't care because now
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:10.520]  it's national security. And here is USA Today weekend edition. Are our stadiums safe? And
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:15.280]  it goes on in there to say, the Israelis are advising us we'll turn America into like the
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.640]  West Bank.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:21.080]  And the government people will be like the Israelis, and all the rest of us will be like
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:25.720]  the Palestinians with no rights. That's actually what it says. But doesn't that sound good
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:31.820]  America? The globalist with their little special IDs, they are gonna be God, and all the rest
[01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.520]  of us, we are insurgents.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:39.360]  Well, you guys show the CBS News article from Friday, police train that are trained that
[01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:44.480]  citizens are insurgents. Yes, this is what it's like to live in an occupied country where
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:49.960]  they just phase in the martial law slowly. But pretty soon you start to flame at one,
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:55.960]  pretty soon it's at 10, or to quote Spinal Tap 11, we're about an eight now, and it'll
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:21:56.960]  go on up.
[01:21:56.960 --> 01:22:01.480]  And don't worry, all your prosperity will be taken, you'll be a good slave, but you'll
[01:22:01.480 --> 01:22:07.320]  learn to cheer it though. You'll learn to cheer it. So I was watching the Kentucky Derby
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:16.360]  at my parents and saw the TSA with the army, army, the regular army, searching everyone
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:20.920]  and standing around with machine guns as if they would stop a real terrorist with a bag.
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.280]  You'd walk up to the army and blow them up. It's just letting you get used to it cuz it's
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:29.440]  for you, cuz they're gonna take your pension and bank account and they're gonna give it
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:30.440]  to Warren Buffett.
[01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:34.960]  I got an article about that I'm gonna get to, but first let's go to your calls quickly.
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:39.720]  Jerry in Washington, you're on the air. Welcome, sir.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:49.560]  Alex, you're a rock star, buddy. I mean, everything you say, definitely. You're just right on.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:50.560]  I mean-
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:54.560]  No, brother. No, no, no. History's right on. I'm just doing my job, but go ahead.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:23:01.120]  Hey, anybody that doesn't belong to Prison Planet TV sucks. It's awesome. But here's
[01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:11.520]  my question. During the Boston Marathon, the whole world, including me, cuz I was watching
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:21.960]  you the day Mr. Pelser was on the show when this took place, and not too long after that,
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:35.160]  the fertilizer plant in West Texas blew up. And we all know they had way too much fertilizer
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.720]  there to begin with.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:44.960]  My question to you, how much do you think was shipped out of there before that plant
[01:23:44.960 --> 01:23:45.960]  blew up?
[01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:50.560]  You know, I don't know and I appreciate your call. People have said, it looks like a bolt
[01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:55.760]  of lightning does it. Well, yeah, I mean, you get a big fire going, lightning gets attracted
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:24:02.200]  to that because of the static electricity. You get the gas of that fuel burning, of that
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:04.840]  fertilizer burning, it can hit a spark and explode.
[01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:09.200]  Let me tell you, I've gone out when it's raining. We have footage of this, by the way, it's
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:15.240]  a new shooting show coming out. It's raining and the tracers caught fires. So we stopped
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:24.520]  using them while it was raining. So that's what goes on when stuff's been dry. Look,
[01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:26.980]  we could shut down all our industry, stuff's still gonna blow up.
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:30.360]  It's part of an industrialized world. There should be safety, but nothing's perfectly
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:35.660]  safe. I mean, that's all I can really say about that situation. A lot of political grandstanding
[01:24:35.660 --> 01:24:42.120]  going on because of it. But look at how a bunch of more people, 15 people died at that.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:47.040]  You're not hearing a call to burn fertilizer or to ban fertilizer. That would kill billions
[01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:51.680]  of people if they banned fertilizer. I mean, people die, that's just part of the world.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:56.940]  Why do they only hype it up when it's to get our guns or it's a bombing to take our liberties?
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:01.760]  Because they're behind it, folks. I'm sorry, I've looked at it too long. Most of the time,
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:08.240]  special interests stage this stuff. It's like 90% of the time or more, I say that to be
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.240]  conservative.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:15.600]  I've found a case where somebody gets a swastika carved on their back or somebody gets anti-gay
[01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:21.680]  stuff put on their apartment dorm that it wasn't the person staging it to get attention.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:30.120]  Well, you don't think government does that? I mean, there aren't, it's amazing. I mean,
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:34.440]  I've seen like ten cases the last decade or more of people burning crosses in their own
[01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:44.000]  yards to get on the news. And anybody that says you should look at elements in the government,
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:47.360]  the government's tens of millions of people, it's much of foreign interest.
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:53.080]  Of course, they're staging stuff. If they'll turn Syria and Libya and Egypt to a great
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:58.040]  extent over to Al-Qaeda. I mean, I read every two days where they burned up a church and
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.640]  killed 20 Christians and it's like, big deal in Egypt where our government put them in
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:07.320]  charge, they're killing Christians. We ought to be hearing every Christian's name, what
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:13.880]  happened to them? But our government's doing that. Our government in Rwanda killed 900,000
[01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:21.000]  Christians. Our government with NATO and UN and all the rest of it, they hate us. Why
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:26.600]  do they hate real Christians? I think you know the answer to that. They're playing for
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:27.600]  the other team.
[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:29.920]  Mark in Ohio, you're on the air, welcome.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:34.360]  Thank you, Alex. Hope you have a good little mini vacation with your family.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:38.440]  I was a mini vacation, I was working during it. Quite frankly, I took those hot baths
[01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:41.520]  in the hot springs that turned me into a vegetable, but go ahead.
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:47.040]  There you go. I just wonder if you have any velocity to the nuclear incident drills starting
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.240]  Monday in Montana?
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:54.080]  I did see that. Look, they have hundreds of drills going constantly. They have black helicopter
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:58.800]  drills. It's all part of desensitization. And to be in the local news to create the
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:04.080]  perception like duck and cover in the 50s and 60s, that an attack is imminent and only
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:06.080]  the government will keep you safe.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:12.320]  Right, right, right. Well, like I said, I saw that and then earlier that week there
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:19.160]  was stuff circulating about some Navy SEALs and they were trying to disarm bombs and this
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:22.960]  and that. I thought it was kind of humorous and then this comes out. I'm like, well, that's
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:23.960]  kind of interesting.
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:28.580]  Well, look, what I need you to do is I need all our listeners to go to the video camera,
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:32.240]  videotape it, put it on YouTube. I'm not a tech guy and I could put stuff on YouTube
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:36.760]  myself. So it's easy to do. God bless you. I appreciate your call, Mark. Everybody needs
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:43.160]  to go out and needs to videotape everything and that will bring down the new world order.
[01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:45.240]  Truth Raider in Oregon, you're on the air.
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:46.240]  Hello, sir.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:47.240]  Hey, buddy.
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:52.240]  I got a simple question for you. In the next year or two, would you consider doing another
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:53.560]  reporter contest?
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:59.640]  If I get enough capital in to hire more reporters, that is my plan. Right now I'm hiring video
[01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:07.560]  people and graphics folks and TV switcher folks. But I am, we got $100,000 contest for
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:13.680]  filmmaking that is now being judged in the next two months. But yes, sir, we're trying
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.560]  to grow the M4's operation.
[01:28:15.560 --> 01:28:19.960]  Great. I did a couple of comprehensive interviews. I thought were pretty good and I was told
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:24.680]  that, hey, you could be the next Alex Jones. So that's great. I'd like to-
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:30.640]  Believe me, I wish there were five Alex Joneses bigger than me. I swear, if some guy came
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:38.240]  along better than me, doing a better job, I would literally say, here's my infrastructure.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:45.160]  I'll go do a report once a week. You're in command now, Admiral. But unfortunately, there's
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.260]  nobody ready to land their troops beyond the energy field. So I'm going to have to sit
[01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:56.440]  up here on the executor and carry that out. All right, Annette, Creed, Ben, Jason, all
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:00.720]  of you, you're coming up.

[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:05.880]  In the last two years alone, the US has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011, storms
[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:11.160]  and floods raged across the US, costing us 20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012, we
[01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:15.480]  saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of sight

[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:27.920]  Now I mentioned this, so I'm gonna get to this right now. All I've got to do with this
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:33.800]  article is read the first paragraph. If you wanna know why big mega rich are always calling
[01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:38.360]  to raise middle class taxes and calling for you to give your guns up, cuz they've learned
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:41.120]  people tend to take over governments and arrest them.
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:46.200]  You don't wanna go to jail like Bernie Madoff or Ken Lay. But old Berkshire Hathaway had
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:51.540]  Warren Buffett shut down the Keystone Pipeline so that he'd have to train the fuel instead
[01:34:51.540 --> 01:34:56.520]  of it being in a pipeline on his own trains and sell it to China on the west coast of
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:03.760]  Canada. Berkshire profit rises 51% shares at record high.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.840]  But your profit making 125,000 a year, you're keeping too much, you need to raise taxes
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:16.640]  so he gets bailout money. Now listen to this quote, Berkshire cash hits record 49.1 billion.
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.920]  That's just his cash as profit climbs and it turns out he takes his money offshore and
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:28.600]  pays zero tax. He tells you about one of his personal taxes and says it's too low.
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:35.560]  And Obama pays 18% and Romney like 12 cuz the rich guys aren't exempt. That's the way
[01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:40.780]  the regulations are written. Now let's get to this. Berkshire, they didn't take over
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:47.840]  schmuck so they'd pay taxes, that's for you. Berkshire profit rises 51% shares at record
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:54.520]  high. Reuters, now listen to the first paragraph. Warren Buffett, the eugenicist, I should add.
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:36:02.000]  Berkshire Hathaway, Inc. on Friday said quarterly profit rose 51% on solid performance in insurance.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.160]  Yeah, they make you buy Obamacare, so it doubled the premiums in the first year. It's good
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:08.680]  to have a business where you're made to buy it.
[01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:14.200]  No wonder you spent 100 million plus on lobbying for that cuz you made billions. And by many
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:24.760]  of its other businesses as well as gains from investments and derivatives. Derivatives,
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:31.320]  85 billion a month is paid to foreign derivatives and to Berkshire Hathaway. Of course, that's
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.320]  classified.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.440]  They won't tell Congress where it goes exactly, just that it goes to Berkshire Hathaway, i.e.
[01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:44.200]  Wells Fargo and five other big banks that are foreign. Your tax money, you're gonna
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:52.680]  pay interest on it too. You pay interest to give him money. Look at him. It's funny. It's
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:53.680]  funny.
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:37:06.640]  Hey, by the way, he wants your guns too. That'll teach you. Look at him smiling. Isn't that
[01:37:06.640 --> 01:37:17.120]  just precious? But he wants your guns in our taxes for the poor people cuz he loves you.
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:22.080]  I'll be watching ABC News and they'll say at the end, sponsored by Berkshire Hathaway
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:26.160]  and the whole show is Warren Buffett going, rich people don't pay enough taxes, raise
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:30.280]  their taxes cuz it goes to him.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:34.200]  But he can make all the money he wants out of fiat garbage. He wants to wreck you. He's
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:39.840]  a eugenicist and he supports agenda 21 to shut down American energy. And don't worry,
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:45.960]  he will. He will just feel trendy and support it cuz it makes you feel good inside and you
[01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.560]  will have your future destroyed.
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:50.660]  Don't worry and take all the vaccines and drink all the fluoride. Don't read the Harvard
[01:37:50.660 --> 01:37:54.040]  study on the brain damage and the cancer. Just wonder why your whole family is sick
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:58.640]  and why you got cancer. Hey, it's all right. The government loves you. I know this is too
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:04.160]  scary to face. It's okay. It's okay.
[01:38:04.160 --> 01:38:09.160]  Here's the good news though. Nigel Farage, routine guest on our show. They've now won
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:17.760]  the major midterm elections in England. And they're set to overtake the Conservative Tory
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:22.800]  Party and defeat Labour. And the government, he survived a plane crash by the way that
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:27.800]  was very suspicious, but ideas are bulletproof.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:32.560]  And Nigel Farage survived, and look at him smiling, celebrating with a pint. He's an
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:38.080]  anti-Bilderberg, anti-New World Order, anti-banker bailout candidate. He's basically Alex Jones,
[01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:43.280]  Ron Paul 2.0. And he's winning, winning, winning, winning, winning. Who started the
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.160]  party with him? Lord Moncton who we need to get back on the show. I need to go over there
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:52.360]  and have a cup of tea with him. Am I going to Bilderberg 2013 next month? I'll tell you
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:53.360]  tomorrow on the show.
[01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:59.480]  Anyways, and if they block me from entering the country, I still win. Win, win, win, win,
[01:38:59.480 --> 01:39:05.960]  win. Okay, let's, cuz you're not gonna stop the signal. Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:39:05.960 --> 01:39:11.720]  Let us talk to Annette in California. Annette, you're on the front lines of the info war.
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:20.640]  Welcome. Thank you, Alex. You know, looking at old pizza pie here with the globalists
[01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:27.440]  and the New World Order agenda and the different components that they have that they're instituting
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:34.160]  to bring America down to its knees. It's not just the GMO and the vaccination and the abortion
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:41.920]  clinics. There's also torture programs going on in this land.
[01:39:41.920 --> 01:39:46.600]  Well, no, that's true. They train police and you can pull up police taser people to answer
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:50.960]  questions now. I mean, North Korea does that. I mean, North Korea is free. Are you a conspiracy
[01:39:50.960 --> 01:39:55.200]  theorist? It's good to taser people to make them give a urine sample or taser people to
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:56.200]  answer questions.
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:01.640]  I mean, there's no Fifth Amendment. That never existed. Extremists said that existed. There's
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:07.200]  no Sixth Amendment for right to counsel. Just take the shots, lady. Drink the fluoride.
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:13.320]  Eat the GMO. Never mind the cancer and death rates exploding. They love you, honey.
[01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:18.360]  Well, there's also the radio frequency technology that they're using.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:22.120]  Oh, it's on record to give mice cancer, but it's good for us.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:28.920]  Well, they have it on every product, every type of item we buy. They have these embedded
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:29.920]  chips in every-
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:34.120]  The Pentagon said 12 years ago in Chicago at the RFID conference, they would use it
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:39.200]  to control us and enslave us, but so what? Look, why fight it? Why not decide to join
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:46.600]  it and feel powerful? Why not worship government? Why not worship tyranny? I mean, what's wrong
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:48.600]  with you, honey?
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:55.520]  Well, actually, I think part of the experimentation with this new technology is concentrating
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:59.880]  on individuals. They call themselves targeted individuals.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:04.800]  No, I know, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am. I know there's a lot of it going on, and God bless you. Listen,
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:10.000]  I gotta apologize on air. I said this, this Yee experiment was wrong, injecting tens of
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.360]  thousands of people with syphilis and letting them spread it and then die over 40 years
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:18.120]  painfully, and that would be saying the government was bad.
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:25.040]  I think it was good. I love the government. And when the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:29.040]  last year injected hundreds of thousands of kids with polio and 60 something thousand
[01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:32.740]  got paralyzed, I mean, I think that was a gift. There's nothing like being paralyzed
[01:41:32.740 --> 01:41:41.160]  for your whole life. I was wrong. Bill Gates, you're such a good man. Creed in Oklahoma,
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:45.680]  you're on the air. Would you like to be paralyzed, Creed? Well, go ahead. I'm sorry.
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:50.560]  Just another crazy person out here from Oklahoma. I just wanna get your thoughts on something
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:58.160]  here. Plans scheduled in a resolution next week on May 8th, Wednesday, for Texas Israel
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:05.920]  Day, two Republican state senators, John Corona and Representative Stephanie Carter have taken
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:08.600]  up the cause to pronounce Texas Israel Day.
[01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:13.360]  I think that's good. And now that Israel's openly backing Al-Qaeda against Assad, what
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:19.720]  have you showed up and said? I support Israeli groups supporting Al-Qaeda. I mean, look,
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:23.000]  are you gonna tell me Al-Qaeda's bad next and that they supposedly attacked the World
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.720]  Trade Center? Everybody knows we were never at war with East Asia. Everybody knows Al-Qaeda's
[01:42:27.720 --> 01:42:29.160]  an ally of America.
[01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:36.120]  Fair enough, but I mean, you have problems with Spain coming up in here, buying up the
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:40.120]  highways or getting access to the toll roads, but I mean, I just wanna hear your thoughts
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.120]  on-
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:47.320]  Listen, I don't have a problem with Spain taking over existing highways and putting
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.160]  giant toll roads on them and doubling and triple prices and raping us, okay? Let's come
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:43:01.520]  back to you, though. How dare you talk bad about Israel backing Al-Qaeda, you filth?
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:07.140]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:11.760]  flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support

[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:05.880]  In the last two years alone, the U.S. has seen huge losses to our food supply. In 2011,
[01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:11.080]  storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone. In 2012,
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:15.440]  we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years. You may think out of
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:19.920]  sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected. The fact is, you are.

[01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:24.640]  to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network. We are on the march. The empire is on the run.
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:34.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network. Alright, we're going back to your calls. I told the
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:41.240]  other caller to hold, but he hung up. Look, everybody has these support Israeli, you know,
[01:47:41.240 --> 01:47:48.080]  support Israel signs up everywhere. And I'm not anti Israel. But then when Israel is bombing
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:53.800]  Syria because the Western backed Al Qaeda rebels are there and they're supporting them.
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:59.720]  I call baloney. I call something else. But I think good old boys out there, such big
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:05.160]  supporters of Israel, they may actually hoist Al Qaeda flags over the VFW. I'll be anti
[01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:09.720]  American because I don't support Al Qaeda. Here's the article on info wars.com. Israel
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:15.720]  helps its Al Qaeda ally with attack on Syria right after Hagel, you know, comes out and
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:18.520]  says, we think there's evidence they use chemical weapons.
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:27.680]  Oh, do they have WMDs like Iraq too? I mean, it's just too amazing. By the way, they dug
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:31.600]  this shop. Now, this is her on 60 minutes. I've seen the clip after this when it became
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:39.760]  a big story back, I think like a 19, was it 19? No, no, no, it was like, it was when she
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:48.120]  was Clinton's guy. So I guess it was right before Bush got in in 2000. And it was over
[01:48:48.120 --> 01:48:51.640]  a million Iraqis once the war started that died of the sanctions.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:56.240]  It was an industrialized country shut down. And she's asked, is a half a million dead
[01:48:56.240 --> 01:49:00.000]  a good price to pay for security in the Gulf? And her answer is yes. And then she got asked
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:05.080]  about on other shows and doubled down. But here's the original with Lesley Stahl on 60
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:06.080]  minutes.
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:11.800]  We have heard that a half a million children have died. I mean, that's more children than
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:21.440]  died in Hiroshima. And is the price worth it? I think this is a very hard choice, but
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:24.660]  the price, we think the price is worth it.
[01:49:24.660 --> 01:49:29.240]  We think the price is worth it. No, no, that was what she said later in 1996. I mean, there's
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:38.080]  a bunch of these clips. She said it over and over again. So there you go. And do you think
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:42.720]  they care about you? The price is worth it for interest? They mean globalist interest.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:46.060]  Well, what are the globalist interests? You better find out what those are, cuz they're
[01:49:46.060 --> 01:49:52.320]  not your interest. They're not your interest. Ben in Georgia, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:56.840]  Hey, Alex, appreciate the opportunity to be on your show this afternoon. I wanted just
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:50:00.240]  to ask you, I've never heard much about a particular individual on your show.
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:03.960]  But as someone that's always been a patriot and a hero in my mind, living here in the
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:09.600]  Atlanta area, and that was the late Larry McDonald. He was the US Congressman that represented-
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:13.600]  Yeah, no, they landed his aircraft and killed him in North Korea, really Russia. No, he
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:18.320]  was the head of the John Birch Society, a Democrat, a really smart, good looking guy
[01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:23.200]  who was presidential material and who was anti-New World Order. And they kidnapped him
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:25.880]  and killed him better than a hammer. I've covered Larry McDonald.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:31.220]  Yeah, the thing that Larry did was that he really used his congressional record and even
[01:50:31.220 --> 01:50:37.180]  introduced a House Bill 773 to have a complete and comprehensive investigation into council
[01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:41.920]  foreign relations and trilateral commission. And a lot of people say, is this the coincidence
[01:50:41.920 --> 01:50:44.200]  that his plane went down over Russia?
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:48.400]  We know, the folks who live here that are very close to him know that there was no conspiracy
[01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:52.880]  on that, that it was an act that was carried out by the Rockefellers, by David Rockefeller
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:54.800]  and his cronies.
[01:50:54.800 --> 01:50:58.800]  Now they never hurt anybody. They're good people. Have you had your fluoride water today?
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:04.240]  I appreciate your call, Ben. Let's talk to Jason in Ohio. Jason, you're on the air.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:10.400]  Hey, Alex, what's going on? I'm from the great state of Ohio, the great police state, brother.
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:14.840]  Speaking of police states, we're gonna air it tomorrow, ran out of time today. The residents
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:21.040]  of Boston and Watertown, they did not like having guns pointed at them and made to march
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:22.400]  down the street with their hands up.
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:26.680]  But I say to prove they're not dangerous, the police should have executed all of them.
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:29.520]  They already are with the fluoride water, why not?
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:34.800]  The police just shot 137 rounds at one car route here and all they found was a police
[01:51:34.800 --> 01:51:35.800]  cannon.
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:40.080]  I think they should execute the whole city to prove they're safe. I think only police
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:43.680]  should be allowed to live. That's basically what the globalists are doing with eugenics.
[01:51:43.680 --> 01:51:48.000]  I'm being a little sarcastic today, a little bit of dark satire, but that's what the New
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.120]  World Order is, Jason, is they're just getting rid of everybody's soft kill. Notice how many
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:53.960]  people are sick and dying right now?
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:58.240]  It's gonna get a lot better. It's not only the Iraqis that get to die.
[01:51:58.240 --> 01:52:04.360]  Hey, Alex, over here in Cleveland, all the mayors, all is under links. Everybody's on
[01:52:04.360 --> 01:52:08.320]  agenda 21, left side, right side, Republicans and Democrats.
[01:52:08.320 --> 01:52:12.160]  No, they're shutting the economy down. They're gonna bankrupt everything and teach you to
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:17.120]  go on food stamps. So you're under government control. And so you roll that sleeve up and
[01:52:17.120 --> 01:52:22.600]  take that vaccine. I say take it. I support the government. Thank you, Jason. Peter in
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:24.480]  Washington, you're on the air.
[01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:27.480]  Have you had your vaccines today, Peter?
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:37.080]  Yeah, I'd like to read something on a collateral issue. It's from J. Robert Oppenheimer, the
[01:52:37.080 --> 01:52:39.800]  principal developer of the American atom bomb.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:40.800]  Yes.
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:46.420]  And here's what he said. There are children playing in the streets who could solve some
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:52.900]  of my top problems in physics because they have modes of sensory perception that I lost
[01:52:52.900 --> 01:52:59.240]  long ago. Of course, Ray Kurzweil would think that's silly since he knows everything.
[01:52:59.240 --> 01:53:04.860]  No, no, that's true. Top scientists are obsessed with adolescents and young people depict their
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:09.640]  brains because brain cells start dying at about 25 in mass. And absolutely the youth
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:14.760]  have it all. We need to have a computer to know the universe. We have the computer. We
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:16.480]  are the universe.
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:22.040]  We are made in the image of the big G God. Pretty heavy stuff, huh, compadre?
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:23.040]  Yes.
[01:53:23.040 --> 01:53:27.080]  Yeah, I've seen that quote. I actually read that in the book he wrote. I forget the name
[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:30.040]  of it. But what's your point on that issue?
[01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:47.280]  Well, my point is just that, that they don't even know everything. And yet they're so narrow
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:50.360]  in these manmade computers.
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:52.560]  That's right, it's called cancer. It's called cancer.
[01:53:52.560 --> 01:53:59.720]  They destroy humanity. They're enemies of humanity in the truest sense of the word.
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:07.680]  And I wasn't sure whether you had the quote, but certainly from a man like Oppenheimer
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:14.920]  who was not such a moral person, although he was sorry for a lot of things by the time
[01:54:14.920 --> 01:54:25.120]  he was, you know, before he died. But he was a man of thought and a man of action. And
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:31.960]  I think the reason why, one reason why he got that big job was because his family had
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:41.420]  a ranch, a summer home out in New Mexico where they had to draw water themselves and he rode
[01:54:41.420 --> 01:54:43.400]  the horses and he-
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:49.160]  No, no, that's right. The globalist are the most specialized, like cold blooded people
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:53.760]  you've ever seen. I appreciate your great points, Peter. Let's punch this quote back
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:57.880]  up. There are children playing in the streets who can solve some of my top problems in physics
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:02.560]  because they have models, modes of sensory perception that I lost long ago.
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:06.560]  And that's Robert Oppenheimer, J Robert Oppenheimer. You're absolutely right. Listen, here's the
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:13.040]  issue. If cancer had a consciousness, it would believe it was winning. And the globalists
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:18.360]  don't have empathy. They have a crazed lust for power, so they get power. They are the
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:24.120]  plague. They are the enemy. They are the enemy. And they have dumbed humanity down in an attempt
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:25.440]  to be able to take it over.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:32.020]  They see humanity as a wild mold, as they call us in quotes, out of control. Instead
[01:55:32.020 --> 01:55:37.220]  of focusing that to go to the stars, they have tried to dumb it all down in the worst
[01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:42.240]  possible calculation I can imagine. And that's because they're devil run, folks. You can
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:49.360]  promote everyone, a spirit of cancer. I mean, turn humanity loose. Don't clamp it down.
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:53.120]  And then they say, well, we're clamping it down because humanity will create a super
[01:55:53.120 --> 01:55:56.960]  weapon and blow us up. And then they're the ones, the globalists tried to blow up the
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:55:59.300]  atmosphere in the 60s.
[01:55:59.300 --> 01:56:05.960]  It's in Discovery Channel stuff with the actor, yeah, Trinity and Beyond with Shatner, but
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:09.680]  the point is already read about it. But there they are trying to blow the atmosphere up
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:14.880]  and set the world on fire. I mean, cuckoo, cuckoo. Let's jam in one more. Thank you,
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:19.160]  Peter. Ramon in Florida, sorry to Aaron and Sam. Ramon, you're our tail gunner here at
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:20.160]  the end of the transmission.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:26.720]  How you doing, Alex? I'm calling here for FEMA Region 4 down here in the United States
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:32.240]  of Nazi Germany. And we spoke on the 28th of March and I predicted, well, I predicted
[01:56:32.240 --> 01:56:36.240]  from listening to you and a lot of other intelligent people that they'd be using a false flag to
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:37.240]  try to bring us down.
[01:56:37.240 --> 01:56:41.560]  Oh, yeah, you could see the build up for it. Yeah, but they wouldn't do that. I mean, they're
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:42.560]  nice people.
[01:56:42.560 --> 01:56:46.320]  Yeah, just like they wouldn't help in 93 to blow up the world trade and they wouldn't
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:50.880]  create Al-Qaeda back in the 80s. And yeah, we know. But the reason why I'm calling it
[01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:54.760]  this cuz I like to speak directly to the New World Order cuz I know you guys are listening.
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:56.640]  You got 30 seconds, go ahead.
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:57:02.000]  We're not afraid of you. We're here to fight you to the end of time. It's going down. It's
[01:57:02.000 --> 01:57:06.080]  the final one. We're ready for you. We're here for whatever you got to bring. We're
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:10.960]  not scared. We're going to do whatever it takes to bring humanity back to where it started
[01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:11.960]  at.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:16.680]  We're God. So all you New World Order chumps that think you're taking us down, you got
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:17.680]  another thing coming.
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:21.560]  God bless you. You got to end it there. Beautiful caller, sorry to Aaron and Sam. He said it
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:25.840]  all. That's what I meant to say at the start of the show. They want to deny they're buying
[01:57:25.840 --> 01:57:30.600]  the bullets, the armored vehicles, the vaccine poisons, because the devil's biggest trick
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:31.600]  is they didn't exist.
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:35.320]  Well, you know what? We know you guys are devils. We know your cancer. We know your
[01:57:35.320 --> 01:57:40.080]  agenda. We know your globalist. We know you hate liberty. You use America to set up world
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:46.160]  government while you destroy it. We're aware of you. We see you. And that's right. We're
[01:57:46.160 --> 01:58:05.840]  not going down without a fight, scum.
