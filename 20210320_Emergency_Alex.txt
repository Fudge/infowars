[00:00.000 --> 00:25.780]  Infowars. Tomorrow's news today. Infowars. Tomorrow's news today. Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:25.780 --> 00:36.860]  we are live broadcasting worldwide on this Saturday, March 20th, 2021 global transmission.
[00:36.860 --> 00:42.980]  And by live, I feel like I'm live. I'm taping this a few hours before it is streamed out.
[00:42.980 --> 00:46.900]  So it's technically not exactly live. They call it tape to air, but we're teleprompter
[00:46.900 --> 00:53.280]  free coming direct at you. And we'll be back tomorrow night, live four to 6 PM with the
[00:53.280 --> 00:57.720]  Alex Jones show. Then of course, Sunday live, though, in Troyer after that 6 to 8 PM. And
[00:57.720 --> 01:01.920]  there's a weekday shows that are all live as well. A lot of times on Saturdays, I come
[01:01.920 --> 01:07.000]  in here and do a live show, but with a tape show, we have time to add more articles, more
[01:07.000 --> 01:13.000]  documents, more video clips. And overall, it's a more polished presentation than some
[01:13.000 --> 01:20.200]  of the live transmissions. Here we are. So I was really taking stock of the world and,
[01:20.200 --> 01:24.800]  and where we all are right now, from my perspective, I know you've got your perspective. We all
[01:24.800 --> 01:29.800]  tune into shows like this and try to expand our, our, our understanding about where the
[01:29.800 --> 01:34.820]  world is right now. And so I want to kind of set out the waterfront here and then lay
[01:34.820 --> 01:39.660]  out what I'm gonna be breaking down in this special, basically commercial free transmission
[01:39.660 --> 01:43.860]  that they may air a few ads later in the show, but you won't have the normal 14 minutes of
[01:43.860 --> 01:49.360]  ads an hour for my regular show. That is a talk radio show in a TV format with a standard
[01:49.360 --> 01:55.920]  14 minutes per hour that TV and radio have here. When we do these special, either live
[01:55.920 --> 02:01.400]  or tape to air transmissions that are so popular on Saturdays, it is essentially commercial
[02:01.400 --> 02:05.720]  free, though we may have a few commercials, have a few promos. It is not a set time. And
[02:05.720 --> 02:12.320]  if anything, it's just something to give us a break to kind of reset and say, get a guest
[02:12.320 --> 02:16.600]  on that we're lining up like Chris sky. That'll be joining us coming up here in a few minutes,
[02:16.600 --> 02:21.880]  a great activist who was really leading the charge against the great reset and the globalist
[02:21.880 --> 02:27.200]  takeover. Okay, let's go ahead and lay it out here. Here's the good news. Anytime the
[02:27.200 --> 02:31.120]  globalist want to make you depressed, anytime they want to make you feel like you've lost
[02:31.120 --> 02:34.320]  everything, anytime they want to make you feel like you're worthless and you're dirty,
[02:34.320 --> 02:39.600]  you're bad. That's because they want to demoralize you so that you're not focused on them and
[02:39.600 --> 02:46.400]  the crimes they've committed. And they had on the shelf, this great reset, this big operation
[02:46.400 --> 02:53.720]  lockstep, this event 201, this crimson contagion, this UN corporate globalist plan to take over
[02:53.720 --> 02:58.480]  the planet, they've had this on the books on the shelf, ready to roll out under different
[02:58.480 --> 03:02.800]  scenarios for at least 20 years that we can prove it and see it. I've got all the articles
[03:02.800 --> 03:08.360]  and documents here today and I'll show you those. So think about that. They just threw
[03:08.360 --> 03:14.760]  everything they've got at us. And their master plan for the post human world and we're dirty
[03:14.760 --> 03:21.160]  and we've got to be depopulated and carbon is evil and we wear these face diapers. They've
[03:21.160 --> 03:28.760]  done all of that early because they're behind schedule and because Jeffrey Epstein's whole
[03:28.760 --> 03:34.520]  compromising the scientists network got exposed. And because their whole world government derivative
[03:34.520 --> 03:38.480]  scam got exposed and because the communist Chinese spies basically running the European
[03:38.480 --> 03:43.840]  Union and running the US government and running major universities and Hollywood got exposed.
[03:43.840 --> 03:50.240]  And so because they were so desperate, they hit the panic button and launched the world
[03:50.240 --> 03:55.600]  into their chicken little event that they had been admitting that they were developing
[03:55.600 --> 04:01.420]  and planning in the future to bring in their cash flow society to bring in their AI system.
[04:01.420 --> 04:06.240]  But they've been forced to bring it in basically behind schedule. It's badly coordinated and
[04:06.240 --> 04:10.760]  it counts on our compliance to be successful. That's why it is what you should know the
[04:10.760 --> 04:17.760]  term is a permanent emergency. And just think about every facet of how, whether you're in
[04:17.760 --> 04:24.880]  Australia or whether you are in Canada or whether you are in France or whether you are
[04:24.880 --> 04:30.040]  in Ireland, you walk into any restaurant, any grocery store, any bar, and you want a
[04:30.040 --> 04:35.400]  menu and they go, Oh, paper's bad. Humans touch that. We have a QR code here waiting
[04:35.400 --> 04:42.760]  for you. And when you aim your phone at it before you even hit a button or a video, this
[04:42.760 --> 04:46.800]  happened to me today. I was in a restaurant this morning. I'd never aimed at that QR code.
[04:46.800 --> 04:52.960]  I aimed my phone at the QR code. And before I even started recording or taking a photo,
[04:52.960 --> 05:01.680]  it said you are at Waterloo ice house. Would you like to see their website or their menu?
[05:01.680 --> 05:06.360]  It's all AI. It's already hooked in. It's already live. It's already promiscuous. It's
[05:06.360 --> 05:11.180]  already grabbing everything. It's already doing everything. And it's replacing you that
[05:11.180 --> 05:19.400]  when you go to a restaurant or you go to a bar, Oh, we can't have any menus because humans
[05:19.400 --> 05:25.000]  are dirty in the future. Robots will deliver the drink from the bar and it will take out
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.700]  that personal little bar, that personal little restaurant and that personal relationship
[05:29.700 --> 05:33.460]  the globalist want to get rid of and vertically integrate the economy. And they admit more
[05:33.460 --> 05:37.380]  billionaires made in China the last year than all other nations combined. They admit doubling
[05:37.380 --> 05:44.300]  and tripling the profits of every big tech company because they engineered this entire
[05:44.300 --> 05:50.300]  thing. So when you go to a restaurant or you go to a bar, refuse to do the QR code. Say,
[05:50.300 --> 06:00.300]  I don't have a phone. Don't ask them, Oh, uh, please, please, please, please. Can I
[06:00.300 --> 06:05.320]  have a paper menu? Just say, I don't have a phone because again, the phones are a little
[06:05.320 --> 06:09.500]  digital minders for the global social credit score. And if you just understand those simple
[06:09.500 --> 06:15.060]  points and realize you're being caught in a trap, you're being caught in a system of
[06:15.060 --> 06:21.100]  enslavement. And then if you just simply warn others, it will all basically collapse. That
[06:21.100 --> 06:27.920]  is their whole system that is designed to collapse us instead of us collapsing. We need
[06:27.920 --> 06:32.160]  to collapse the globalist parasitic system. So let's talk a little bit about the victories
[06:32.160 --> 06:36.980]  we're having and the big successes we're having. Yes, the enemy has launched their main attack.
[06:36.980 --> 06:42.180]  Yes, Gigi ping openly came out and said six months ago, we need a global QR code to buy
[06:42.300 --> 06:47.300]  and sell in a global social credit score in a global medical system. And yes, the UN is
[06:47.300 --> 06:51.700]  following lockstep. And so is Bill and Melinda Gates foundation and the Clinton foundation. And
[06:51.700 --> 06:57.060]  it's all here. And they've got a bunch of zombies that are going to follow their orders because they
[06:57.060 --> 07:03.220]  want to virtue signal and feel good about themselves. But as it becomes clear that the
[07:03.220 --> 07:07.740]  noose never comes off your neck, Oh, they may tighten it down and then loosen it a little,
[07:07.740 --> 07:12.460]  and then tighten it down even more, and then loosen it a little bit, and then tighten it down
[07:12.460 --> 07:20.740]  even more. So when they finally drop the lever and open the hatch, and you are about to have your neck
[07:20.740 --> 07:26.260]  broken politically, culturally, spiritually, you won't resist in the final moment when the
[07:26.260 --> 07:32.780]  boa constrictor is breaking your bones. And so that's what all this is, is complete and total
[07:33.060 --> 07:39.460]  social engineering and training. And so as they tell us, Oh, we're going back to normal, and then
[07:39.460 --> 07:43.740]  in a few months, say there's a new strain, we've got to clamp back down again. And as they release
[07:43.740 --> 07:48.820]  again, and then tighten back down again, you've got to be warning people that this is a permanent
[07:48.820 --> 07:57.900]  emergency. You've got to be warning people that this isn't going to be reversed. You've got to be
[07:57.900 --> 08:03.300]  warning people this is the great reset in a giant trap, and that complying with it doesn't get you
[08:03.300 --> 08:09.020]  out of it. Complying with it is like a fly not struggling in a spider's web and thinking if it
[08:09.020 --> 08:14.500]  just complies with a spider, it's going to be okay. No, your only hope is to struggle free from
[08:14.500 --> 08:21.100]  the web. And the longer you stay in the web, the more you support the web, the more you support the
[08:21.100 --> 08:26.260]  digital trackers and them taking your temperature at the hotel or at the restaurant or at the gym,
[08:26.260 --> 08:32.100]  the more you go along with all the kabuki theater, the more you're going to accept the national ID
[08:32.100 --> 08:38.900]  card, the digital tracking system, the more you're going to accept all the new hoops they want you
[08:38.900 --> 08:45.020]  to jump through. And Chris sky is really, really, really, really good at laying all this out. In
[08:45.020 --> 08:50.060]  fact, coming up in a few minutes when we get him on, we're going to air a video I didn't have time
[08:50.060 --> 08:57.020]  to air on the Friday show. It's about five minutes long of him back in September, predicting
[08:57.020 --> 09:02.960]  everything that later transpired, but he'll tell you, he didn't predict any of this. It came out in
[09:02.960 --> 09:10.880]  UN documents that were then picked up by this provinces of Canada, and the same system happened
[09:10.880 --> 09:14.900]  here with our states. So it comes from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to the Rockefeller
[09:14.900 --> 09:20.260]  Foundation to the UN, the Chinese adopt it, and everyone says, Oh, look how China does it. And
[09:20.260 --> 09:25.620]  then we're supposed to adopt it. And I'm going to show you when Chris sky's on with us, who has been
[09:25.620 --> 09:31.380]  drafted to head up the Rockefeller Foundation. And they admit that they helped engineer the drills
[09:31.380 --> 09:38.980]  that then went live. That was the COVID-19 rollout via lockstep, event 201, and of course,
[09:38.980 --> 09:45.460]  Crimson Contagion. So this was all planned out. This has all been meticulously done. And they
[09:45.460 --> 09:53.220]  just hope you accept it as if the news is like, Hey, 15 days to cut the curve. Hey, just a few
[09:53.220 --> 10:00.980]  months to wear the mask. Hey, just a few years. It's forever. So that's, that's how they do this,
[10:00.980 --> 10:07.780]  ladies and gentlemen. And it's incredible. Also, we're going to talk, Chris, about what are the
[10:07.780 --> 10:15.940]  globalist thinking. 25 countries in Europe have banned the AstraZeneca virus vector vector virus
[10:15.940 --> 10:20.740]  system. It's so dangerous, causing blood clots, strokes, and heart attacks and killing a lot of
[10:20.740 --> 10:29.940]  people. But it's not even one 10th as bad as the Moderna and Pfizer mRNA vaccines. This is all
[10:29.940 --> 10:34.820]  illegal, skipping animal trials, skipping human trials, going directly to testing on the general
[10:34.900 --> 10:42.820]  public and calling billions being vaccinated a trial. No, that's not a trial. That'd be like if
[10:42.820 --> 10:47.860]  you went and test drove a car and just because you put the key in the ignition, you own it.
[10:48.980 --> 10:55.540]  No, they are they are engaged in a violations of the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code at a
[10:55.540 --> 11:02.340]  galactic level. And I had again, the man, the lawyer who wrote the US biological weapons laws
[11:03.220 --> 11:10.900]  in the late 80s on and he said on its face. And to its very core, it is a war crime.
[11:12.100 --> 11:17.220]  These are crimes against humanity, because they couldn't get the mRNA gene editing authorized.
[11:17.220 --> 11:22.180]  No government would do it. The companies couldn't get it done. And so they had this big
[11:22.180 --> 11:27.460]  crisis and this big breakdown to then get governments to give liability protection
[11:27.460 --> 11:34.260]  to gene therapy. And I have a whole folder on gene therapy, mainstream news, admitting
[11:34.260 --> 11:39.460]  just a year ago that it was causing massive deaths and cancers in people that were doing
[11:39.460 --> 11:46.660]  gene therapies. But now if you try to talk about gene therapy causing cancer, you get censored.
[11:47.940 --> 11:53.380]  So this is a big move. This is a biological rape of the public. So why are they doing it? Well,
[11:53.380 --> 11:58.500]  look at this overhead shot. Bill Gates did a Reddit asked me anything yesterday,
[11:59.060 --> 12:03.140]  and had to basically quit it early because everybody was piling on about his eugenics
[12:03.140 --> 12:06.740]  background about Jeffrey Epstein, how he lied about working with Jeffrey Epstein,
[12:06.740 --> 12:11.060]  about how they were using Epstein to compromise top scientists and heads of universities and
[12:11.060 --> 12:17.380]  federal regulators. There's a full article and transcripts of what happened at info wars.com.
[12:17.380 --> 12:22.580]  It's amazing. So Bill Gates may have his stolen hundreds of billions, and he may call himself a
[12:22.580 --> 12:28.420]  philanthropist being tax exempt, but he is one of the most hated men in history, despite all
[12:28.420 --> 12:33.540]  his censorship. It doesn't matter that his own news guard fact checking website that he pays for
[12:33.540 --> 12:39.140]  and runs through Microsoft came out and said, I was a liar that India hadn't banned the Pfizer
[12:39.140 --> 12:44.740]  vaccine that he owns part of, but India did ban it. And now a bunch of other countries banned it
[12:44.740 --> 12:51.060]  as well. So they are lying so much, ladies and gentlemen, that's not a sign of strength.
[12:52.740 --> 12:58.260]  That is a major, major, major sign of weakness. I mean, look at this next deadline. Bill Gates
[12:58.260 --> 13:03.940]  says he'll fly a lot less and eat more synthetic meat to fight climate change. Does anyone believe
[13:03.940 --> 13:09.220]  he's, quote, eating synthetic meat? He just wants to ban regular meat or make you pay more for it
[13:09.220 --> 13:14.740]  from him. That's why he's actually buying into farms and ranches and beef production and is the
[13:14.740 --> 13:20.020]  biggest landowner now of farmland in the United States because he's cornering the market on this
[13:20.100 --> 13:23.940]  in the future. When they're done bankrupting all the small farms, he'll be the only one left
[13:23.940 --> 13:31.700]  standing. He's a monopoly man. He has a very sinister criminal will. Let's talk more about
[13:31.700 --> 13:36.580]  the positive things happening. They may have stolen the election from Trump, which they did,
[13:36.580 --> 13:40.260]  and the American people. They stole it from us. In fact, they took it right in front of us.
[13:40.820 --> 13:46.180]  And then they put that puppet in hoping that he'd be old and somewhat senile,
[13:46.180 --> 13:50.340]  make it controlling, but not falling down and bumbling and calling his daughter,
[13:51.300 --> 13:57.060]  his brother, and doing all the other insane things he's doing and saying China can invade Hong Kong
[13:57.060 --> 14:02.740]  and China can kill the Uyghurs. And then the Chinese don't respect us and get in our face
[14:02.740 --> 14:08.020]  when we're up there at the summit in Alaska a few days ago because they know they own Biden.
[14:08.020 --> 14:13.700]  So as bad as that is now, everyone's going to see the Chai Khan puppet that is Biden.
[14:14.340 --> 14:18.740]  Everyone's going to see them liquidate the borders and cause a giant migrant crisis with tens of
[14:18.740 --> 14:23.140]  thousands pouring across the day. Everyone's going to see it in the streets. Everyone's going to
[14:23.140 --> 14:27.540]  witness the world making fun of us. Everyone's going to witness the left running the country
[14:27.540 --> 14:33.460]  in the ground. You're going to get a big, fat, juicy taste of it. And it's going to backfire.
[14:34.020 --> 14:39.700]  Again, why wouldn't our own elites want America to be strong? After all, they run it because
[14:39.700 --> 14:43.860]  they're not elites. They're perverts. They're weirdos. They're degenerates. They're crazy
[14:43.860 --> 14:48.260]  people who've been trained from birth to want to bring down America because America is the
[14:48.260 --> 14:54.500]  Renaissance and Christian. And it goes directly against the authoritarian legalism of the
[14:54.500 --> 15:01.220]  communist Chinese. And so for them, they want to mount America's soul on the wall. They want to
[15:01.220 --> 15:06.900]  catch us like a big fish and stuff us. They want metaphysically to feel like they've had triumph
[15:07.540 --> 15:12.500]  over America because for all of America's problems, we had a bill of rights, a constitution.
[15:12.500 --> 15:17.060]  We had a Christian ethos. We had an idea of liberty and freedom and individualism.
[15:17.060 --> 15:21.780]  And the collectivist want to destroy that just like the devil hates the light.
[15:24.100 --> 15:30.500]  And so there is a full repudiation of our Republic, a full repudiation of everything
[15:30.500 --> 15:38.820]  we stand for, because it stands in complete contravention and is anathema to the Satanist.
[15:40.020 --> 15:44.740]  And so here's a quick report I followed last night, but I think it's pretty powerful
[15:45.460 --> 15:51.940]  dealing with Biden and his incredible gaffes of I race upstairs while Trump hobbles downstairs and
[15:51.940 --> 15:56.500]  all of his boasting and all of his ridiculous garbage. And now there he is falling down three
[15:56.500 --> 16:02.580]  times trying to run up the gantry like he's Superman or like he's, you know, Barack Obama.
[16:04.900 --> 16:09.620]  And it doesn't matter if the media covers this up, it doesn't matter because everybody one way
[16:09.620 --> 16:14.580]  or another ends up seeing it. And the more they try to censor to cover up who they are,
[16:14.580 --> 16:21.620]  the more they're going to be staring back at themselves in that mirror. So here is the report
[16:22.420 --> 16:27.620]  video of Biden collapsing three times. We're going to come back with the latest COVID news
[16:27.620 --> 16:32.020]  worldwide, the UN martial law operation, and we're going to talk to Chris Sky. Please stay with us.
[16:33.300 --> 16:41.620]  The puppet in chief, the stooge, the communist Chinese operative, Joe Biden collapsed three
[16:41.620 --> 16:47.700]  times on national television yesterday. And the communist Chinese are celebrating
[16:48.500 --> 16:53.060]  America's weakness right now. Look at how he steps and look how I step.
[16:54.260 --> 16:58.500]  Watch how I run up ramps and he stumbles down ramps. Okay, come on.
[17:05.940 --> 17:11.380]  Karma is a bitch. That was Joe Biden a year ago during the campaign saying,
[17:11.380 --> 17:16.100]  I'm going to race up those stairs and Trump can't even go down those stairs. Well, at least Trump,
[17:16.100 --> 17:20.020]  after it rained at a military commencement, was being careful going down the stairs.
[17:20.020 --> 17:24.660]  No, you certainly race up them and fall down not once, not twice, but three times. And then
[17:24.660 --> 17:29.140]  reading all the comments on Twitter and that echo chamber, praising him and saying, why is this
[17:29.140 --> 17:34.820]  news? Can you imagine if Trump fell down once? What about twice? What about three times? Hillary
[17:34.820 --> 17:38.740]  fell down a few times. It was a big deal, but she's well known to have actually no balance,
[17:38.740 --> 17:44.100]  no vision, and has major brain problems just like Joe Biden. And Joe Biden is emblematic
[17:44.100 --> 17:48.500]  of how this globalist elite is really good at dominating the American people and dividing and
[17:48.500 --> 17:53.860]  conquering us, but not standing up to Russia, not standing up to China. It was a communist Chinese
[17:53.860 --> 18:00.580]  just yesterday up in Alaska confronting the US envoy to China saying, oh, you have Black Lives
[18:00.580 --> 18:05.060]  Matter. You can't challenge our Uyghur death camps, our Buddhist or Christian death camps
[18:05.060 --> 18:11.460]  that are thousands of times any crimes committed here against minorities. That's communist China
[18:11.460 --> 18:16.340]  funding that movement against America, manipulating what they see as tribal and
[18:16.340 --> 18:20.500]  domestic differences in our country. And Joe Biden, the Democrats on the Chinese payroll
[18:20.500 --> 18:25.300]  have greased the skids for that. So now they have no respect for Joe Biden and his puppet
[18:25.300 --> 18:31.220]  regime that they financed when they finally put up a meager stand against their tyranny.
[18:32.740 --> 18:37.540]  Today, we'll have an opportunity to discuss key priorities, both domestic and global,
[18:38.180 --> 18:43.380]  so that China can better understand our administration's intentions and approach.
[18:44.500 --> 18:51.380]  We'll also discuss our deep concerns with actions by China, including in Xinjiang, Hong Kong,
[18:51.380 --> 18:56.500]  Taiwan, cyber attacks on the United States, economic coercion toward our allies.
[18:58.020 --> 19:04.260]  Each of these actions threaten the rules-based order that maintains global stability. That's
[19:04.260 --> 19:10.340]  why they're not merely internal matters and why we feel an obligation to raise these issues
[19:10.340 --> 19:16.820]  here today. China is firmly opposed to US interference in China's internal affairs.
[19:17.380 --> 19:24.420]  We have expressed our staunch opposition to such interference and we will take
[19:24.420 --> 19:31.060]  firm actions in response. On human rights, we hope that the United States will do better on
[19:31.060 --> 19:39.380]  human rights. China has made steady progress in human rights and the fact is that there are many
[19:39.380 --> 19:46.340]  problems within the United States regarding human rights, which is admitted by the US itself as well.
[19:46.340 --> 19:54.180]  The United States has also said that countries can't rely on force in today's world to resolve
[19:54.180 --> 20:03.540]  the challenges we face and it is a failure to use various means to topple the so-called
[20:03.540 --> 20:11.220]  authoritarian states. And the challenges facing the United States in human rights are deep-seated.
[20:11.220 --> 20:18.260]  They did not just emerge over the past four years, such as Black Lives Matter. It did not come up
[20:18.260 --> 20:24.900]  only recently. So we do hope that for our two countries, it's important that we manage our
[20:24.900 --> 20:32.340]  respective affairs well instead of deflecting the blame on somebody else in this world.
[20:32.340 --> 20:37.460]  See leftists, the enemy isn't conservatives and Christians and capitalists and nationalists that
[20:37.460 --> 20:43.220]  made America so great. The enemy's authoritarian regimes. Your authoritarian puppet president
[20:43.220 --> 20:48.100]  who said that Putin's a killer and that he confronted him and said, you don't have a soul
[20:48.100 --> 20:52.020]  and Russia better watch out. We're about to take major action against him. So you know Vladimir
[20:52.020 --> 20:58.020]  Putin, you think he's a killer? I do. So what price must he pay? The price he's going to pay,
[20:58.020 --> 21:03.060]  well you'll see shortly. So the Russians pulled their ambassadors and challenged Biden to a debate
[21:03.700 --> 21:08.180]  and Biden said, oh, I'm too busy playing Mario Kart. I can't do that. I'm too busy falling on
[21:08.180 --> 21:13.620]  my face. No matter how much propaganda comes out from big tech, no matter how much censorship
[21:13.620 --> 21:20.900]  takes place with MSNBC or CNN, it doesn't matter. Reality is still reality. And the whole Harvard,
[21:21.620 --> 21:27.220]  Ivy League, globalist, America-hating trash group, a bunch of pedophiles and control freaks,
[21:27.220 --> 21:32.420]  are a cancer, not a cure. And the whole world's turning against them. The whole world's rejecting
[21:32.420 --> 21:36.980]  them. So while general honorees trained to confiscate American people's guns and they're
[21:36.980 --> 21:41.620]  keeping tens of thousands of troops in DC and they're trying to bully Tucker Carlson off the
[21:41.620 --> 21:48.740]  air, remember that reality still exists. As former President Obama once said, elections have
[21:48.740 --> 21:55.700]  consequences. Well, in the year 2021, stolen elections have consequences. So while the public
[21:55.700 --> 22:00.420]  has fun with this, people go crazy with the memes showing Biden in a wheelchair or Biden with an
[22:00.420 --> 22:04.980]  assisted system going up the stairs, this is really, really dangerous. I mean, he just
[22:04.980 --> 22:09.380]  challenged Putin to a major war. And then, of course, Putin challenged him to a debate. He
[22:09.380 --> 22:14.020]  wouldn't even do it. This is emblematic of the fall of a Republican. We have to reject this
[22:14.020 --> 22:18.740]  fraudulent election, reject the Democratic Party, reject the deep state, and reject the globalist
[22:18.740 --> 22:25.060]  now while we still can. So no matter how big the mainstream media hypes up race war in America and
[22:25.060 --> 22:29.940]  civil war, no matter how many stops they pull out, no matter how much division they sow,
[22:30.900 --> 22:35.620]  at the end of the day, Hollywood and the left and the globalist will still be soulish trash.
[22:36.180 --> 22:44.020]  And their figurehead is a literal, dying, creepy, insane pedophile. And that's the real world. I
[22:44.020 --> 22:49.780]  only pray that as Joe Biden collapses and as President Kamala Harris takes the reins, that
[22:49.780 --> 22:54.500]  somehow sanity is discovered again in this country and we stop capitulating and bowing down the
[22:54.820 --> 23:00.340]  political correctness. America's surrender must end if the world is going to survive.
[23:00.980 --> 23:05.620]  The people of humanity must come together and reject globalism and neoliberalism or there is
[23:05.620 --> 23:09.780]  no future. As for me and the Infowars crew, my great viewers and listeners will continue to
[23:09.780 --> 23:14.180]  fight on. I want to thank you all for your support. Just never forget, though, if you're

[24:29.220 --> 24:49.300]  Infowars. Tomorrow's news today.
[24:50.900 --> 24:56.580]  All right, again, thank you for joining us on this Saturday transmission. Please don't forget,
[24:56.580 --> 25:01.940]  this is an information war. Everything depends on the people having accurate information and to
[25:01.940 --> 25:06.020]  know what they're up against. The only way that happens is you and your word of mouth. And so
[25:06.020 --> 25:11.140]  you're just as important as I am. Just as important as the boom operator. Just as important as the
[25:11.140 --> 25:16.340]  producers and the crew and their punch of the buttons. Just as important as president Trump
[25:16.340 --> 25:23.540]  or Tucker Carlson or Chris Sky. That's coming on in a few minutes. You are incredibly important
[25:23.540 --> 25:27.700]  and I cannot stress that enough to you. And let me give you the positive news again.
[25:29.220 --> 25:34.100]  This is a whole giant globalist takeover plan. Decades in the making. After Chris Sky leaves,
[25:34.100 --> 25:37.860]  I'm going to show you those documents. New ones have come out that are even more damning. It's
[25:37.860 --> 25:45.220]  insane. And this is the way the world works. There's a vacuum and it doesn't last long.
[25:45.220 --> 25:50.100]  When you have a free society, it produces wealth. Then corrupt people move in to take it over.
[25:50.100 --> 25:53.220]  If you don't stand up for your freedom, if you don't stand up for chivalry,
[25:53.220 --> 25:56.420]  you don't stand up for basic liberty and guard it jealously.
[25:57.540 --> 26:03.620]  The jewel of liberty must be guarded jealously and must be defended with our blood. I mean,
[26:03.620 --> 26:05.940]  that's a paraphrase, a quote from Thomas Jefferson.
[26:08.260 --> 26:13.060]  And so when you don't do that, boom, it's like a submarine with a bulkhead open. You start flooding
[26:14.340 --> 26:19.300]  and the tyrants come. But we know the psychology of tyrants. We know the pathology of tyrants.
[26:19.300 --> 26:27.140]  We know the modus operandi, the MO. They always overreach. They always go for broke. They always
[26:27.700 --> 26:32.580]  are self-destructive. Whether it's a low-level serial killer or Adolf Hitler,
[26:34.580 --> 26:40.980]  they always go too far. And so we know how history works and we know what the globalists are going
[26:40.980 --> 26:46.100]  to do next. So we have that incredible superpower. It's not a superpower. I cannot tell you,
[26:46.100 --> 26:52.500]  this is not about bragging. This is about positivity and reality. I got invited to go
[26:52.500 --> 26:57.540]  to Florida a few weeks ago by some folks. And when I was there, I got to meet with the who's
[26:57.540 --> 27:04.980]  who of the American resistance. You name it, we met with them. And the first rule of fight clubs,
[27:04.980 --> 27:10.980]  don't talk about fight clubs. Second rule, don't talk about it. But they all wanted me to know,
[27:10.980 --> 27:15.220]  Alex, you've done a great job. You helped start this all modern movement, take care of yourself,
[27:15.220 --> 27:19.780]  keep fighting. We're going to win. Everybody we know in corporations and the military hates what
[27:19.780 --> 27:25.460]  the globalists are doing. It's a very few Rockefeller, Rothschild, Gates type people,
[27:25.460 --> 27:30.580]  a few hundred on top, but their own system hates them. And we're going to win. We've just got to
[27:30.580 --> 27:36.020]  stay the course and never back down. And that's what I was basically told. And I'm just going to
[27:36.020 --> 27:39.380]  leave it at that. And it's not because there's some secret military cabal is going to save us
[27:39.380 --> 27:45.460]  either. It's that our people are everywhere. So when Joe Biden says, I want to purge the military
[27:45.460 --> 27:49.780]  and the police, they're all white supremacist, replace white supremacist with black Patriots,
[27:49.780 --> 27:54.260]  Hispanic Patriots, white Patriots, red blooded human Patriots that want a future for their
[27:54.260 --> 27:59.380]  children and who aren't Satanists and who aren't pedophiles. The globalist are in trouble. Jeffrey
[27:59.380 --> 28:07.700]  Epstein's whole Bill Gates network was brought down. They're going under. And so now I've always
[28:07.700 --> 28:11.700]  known I've been on there 27 years. So I got, I got to be in some big movies and all the Hollywood
[28:11.700 --> 28:15.380]  people. And it was boring. I didn't really like it. Linkletter was a nice guy, but that was about
[28:15.380 --> 28:18.420]  it. You know, Keanu Reeves, a nice guy. I mean, I know all those guys, what do you hear else is
[28:18.420 --> 28:24.980]  good, but other than them, you know, it's all a mess, but I get to interface now with the common
[28:24.980 --> 28:29.300]  people that are way cooler and way more involved, whether they're a firefighter or a doctor or a
[28:29.300 --> 28:34.500]  nurse or a school teacher or a professor or a scientist or an activist like Chris sky or an
[28:34.500 --> 28:39.860]  activist like Alfie Oaks, these are the real people. They come in every race color and create
[28:39.860 --> 28:48.180]  every color. They all got red blood. They all got a soul. And so today in my life today, I get to go
[28:48.180 --> 28:52.580]  meet with people that I'm not going to tell you who I'm meeting with. It's amazing. Just imagine.
[28:52.580 --> 28:57.620]  And that's it. One of the crew members guessed it. And it's not about Alex Jones has arrived.
[28:57.620 --> 29:00.980]  Like some parrot, you know, sitting at the top of the tree. That's how it works with parents. The
[29:00.980 --> 29:04.820]  coolest parrot sits at the top. I don't care about that. I wouldn't care about going. You
[29:04.820 --> 29:09.940]  couldn't get me to go to LA and meet with the top Hollywood stars. I would not go sit in a room with
[29:09.940 --> 29:14.820]  them. They're soulless. They're puppets. They're nobodies. I get to know the real people. I get to
[29:14.820 --> 29:20.500]  know the salt of the earth. I get to interface with other amazing souls who come in all different
[29:20.500 --> 29:24.820]  packages, but are the same inside. They love justice and love God. And that's what this is
[29:24.820 --> 29:30.980]  about. So you've all heard. It's about the journey, not the destination. The journey is
[29:30.980 --> 29:36.020]  the destination. And so I've been through the fire. I've been through a lot. I've been persecuted.
[29:36.020 --> 29:42.100]  They might kill me, put me in prison. So be it. That's God's will. I just want you to know that
[29:43.140 --> 29:46.660]  everything they do is to make you depressed. Everything they do is to make you give up.
[29:46.660 --> 29:51.220]  Everything they do is to make you shut down and to make others around you depressed. Cause we're
[29:51.220 --> 29:55.300]  all interconnected. So we become depressed because I've gotten not depressed, but compared
[29:55.300 --> 29:59.140]  to the way I usually am bummed out, upset about the mask, upset about the lies, upset about the
[29:59.140 --> 30:03.380]  vaccines, upset about all the deaths and the fraud. And it's all sad and it's all bad, but
[30:03.380 --> 30:08.660]  that's the enemy trying to hold us under psychic water and, and drowned us. We have to realize that
[30:08.660 --> 30:13.380]  God and justice and goodness is real and there are good people. And it's all about being tested.
[30:13.380 --> 30:19.140]  The journey is the destination and it's all about being real. And so not letting them get you down,
[30:20.020 --> 30:24.660]  not letting them break your will. It was about three weeks ago. I had intense dreams and I
[30:24.660 --> 30:29.060]  really wrestled with this and God really touched me. And it was just like, you've got to be
[30:29.060 --> 30:32.260]  positive. You got to accept the victory. You've got to know we're going to win in the end.
[30:32.260 --> 30:37.700]  And you've got to truly be confident Jones and not just be this weight on you and always charging
[30:37.700 --> 30:41.700]  forward and always feeling like you're not doing enough. You've got to still fight harder than
[30:41.700 --> 30:45.700]  ever, but be fulfilled and tell others to be fulfilled. You can say it was my subconscious
[30:45.700 --> 30:51.940]  telling me God, whatever it was real. And as soon as I had that feeling, it was like
[30:51.940 --> 30:55.620]  trillions of pounds of weight came off me and I had more energy to fight tyranny.
[30:56.340 --> 30:59.860]  So that's why it's exciting to talk to someone like Chris guy, who's got that same passion,
[30:59.860 --> 31:05.380]  that same energy. And he's not submitting. It's another example, not giving myself credit. All
[31:05.380 --> 31:09.460]  you support is credit. We helped wake him up when he was a teenager decades ago. Now here he is today
[31:09.460 --> 31:14.980]  being a major leader. And it's about who is he inspiring now? Who are you inspiring with little
[31:14.980 --> 31:18.660]  things you think you're doing are actually big things. When you speak out at church, when you
[31:18.660 --> 31:23.380]  speak out at work, when you lovingly tell people the mask or a hoax, that's something that's not
[31:23.380 --> 31:28.580]  a labor. That's a gift you're giving people. And it's also a gift you're giving yourself.
[31:30.260 --> 31:33.300]  So let me run through some of these headlines. We'll go to Chris guy. We've now got on the line
[31:34.580 --> 31:38.580]  because he told you this just Friday. He told you this when he was on a month ago, he said,
[31:38.580 --> 31:43.060]  they're going to have a third wave claiming not enough people are vaccinated. Even though the
[31:43.060 --> 31:48.580]  studies show the vaccinations are breeding actually dangerous viruses. USA Today, France
[31:48.580 --> 31:53.300]  puts Paris back in lockdown mode for next four weeks beginning Friday night, because they were
[31:53.300 --> 31:56.980]  about to be overthrown by the yellow shirts, because macron's unpopular, because the globalist
[31:56.980 --> 32:02.980]  want to bankrupt small businesses. This is a consolidation siege economic warfare. Coronavirus
[32:02.980 --> 32:07.460]  update, not enough vaccine dosages in Europe to stop a third wave German health minister says,
[32:07.460 --> 32:12.820]  no, it's called herd immunity that does it for something that 99.9% of people don't even get.
[32:13.060 --> 32:17.300]  And the 99 plus percent that get it survive. You average those two together, it's like point
[32:17.300 --> 32:21.860]  zero zero zero something to die from this damn thing. At least we're going to chicken little
[32:21.860 --> 32:25.700]  and run into our houses never come back out again and whole world collapses. Nobody has
[32:25.700 --> 32:30.420]  jobs in the future to the bank's got to give us universal incomes and there's suddenly scarcity
[32:30.420 --> 32:39.220]  everywhere. Dutch police we roll this video. Blast anti lockdown protesters with water cannons
[32:39.220 --> 32:45.940]  after crowd assembles near Van Gogh Museum. This is outrageous. This is garbage, but this
[32:45.940 --> 32:52.420]  is happening everywhere. Do not leave your house never go out again. You are not essential. This
[32:52.420 --> 32:56.820]  is a sick joke. Meanwhile, the globalists are drinking wine and banging hookers and partying.
[32:58.420 --> 33:02.020]  And that was enough Flemish official calls for civil disobedience in Belgium.
[33:02.820 --> 33:09.540]  As they impose a new curfew, that's at Europe wars.com. Thousands gathered to protest against
[33:09.540 --> 33:15.220]  COVID in London. That's MSN. How about hundreds of thousands? I've seen the videos. It's an ongoing
[33:15.220 --> 33:18.260]  live event right now. They're trying to say you can't be on the streets trying to say you got to
[33:18.260 --> 33:22.580]  wear a mask. They're breaking the fear, breaking the conditioning and showing the sheeple how to
[33:22.580 --> 33:27.460]  really live and how it really works. There's some of that incredible, absolutely incredible footage.
[33:27.460 --> 33:34.340]  Meanwhile, Trump Jr. shares video showing father knocking Biden down with golf ball.
[33:34.340 --> 33:40.660]  The media is calling it edited and deceptive and a trick. No, it's called a meme. It's called a joke.
[33:42.500 --> 33:47.940]  Everybody knows the golf ball did not Biden down his own scrabbling up like a dying rat did. So
[33:47.940 --> 33:52.900]  let's show people the real video that's far worse. That's a meme. The fact that they would tell you
[33:52.900 --> 33:57.940]  in the New York times and the hill that it was deceptive is them being deceptive for you or
[33:57.940 --> 34:02.100]  talking to you like you've got a 70 IQ. They wish you did. That's why they try to dumb you down.
[34:02.100 --> 34:06.420]  Here's the actual roll the video with audio, please. I've been walking up the airplane
[34:06.420 --> 34:09.380]  and then falling down three times. Go ahead and roll it for me guys.
[34:14.580 --> 34:17.780]  Just roll the whole thing from the beginning. I really want to just roll this from the beginning.
[34:17.780 --> 34:20.660]  You got to see him scrabbling along down the tarmac. Here it is.
[34:21.940 --> 34:25.140]  All running a little face diapers, little clown suits.
[34:29.460 --> 34:35.380]  He's the big leader. He's the guy they stole the election for. He's got to get 100 people
[34:35.380 --> 34:40.580]  to come out and see him. He's our president. Well, the border is liquefied while the dollar
[34:40.580 --> 34:45.220]  falls apart while the economy dies. He told the illegals, come up here, rush the border
[34:45.220 --> 34:48.740]  immediately. He said, remember that that will play that clip again in a moment after Chris
[34:48.740 --> 34:57.460]  guy leaves. And here he goes to show everybody I can run up that ramp. Look, look, grandson,
[34:57.460 --> 35:03.540]  look, great grandson. I can catch them all. I'm a big boy. Boom, boom, boom.
[35:06.100 --> 35:10.260]  Boy, does that make America look pathetic? And remember, he said I can just race right up there.
[35:10.260 --> 35:16.100]  No problem. You can't watch that enough. AstraZeneca German team discovers thrombosis
[35:16.100 --> 35:20.820]  trigger. Yeah, that'll, that'll give you a heart attack. That'll give you a blood clot. How about
[35:20.820 --> 35:25.940]  a stroke? But Fauci says the variant from UK likely accounts for 30% of COVID infections
[35:25.940 --> 35:31.540]  in the US. Ooh, a new variant. I'm so scared. Oh, like this variant, ABC news. UN says new polio
[35:31.540 --> 35:35.860]  outbreak in Sudan caused by oral vaccine. Bill and Melinda Gates. You try to put that on Twitter
[35:35.860 --> 35:39.780]  and Facebook. They block it because they're helping murder the black babies. That's why
[35:39.860 --> 35:43.780]  they tell you all day. We love black babies. We love black people. Yeah, you love them. You love
[35:43.780 --> 35:50.420]  killing them. Flashback scientists at Sloan Kettering discover MRNA inactivates tumor
[35:50.420 --> 35:56.340]  suppressing proteins, meaning promote cancer. But don't worry, Texas restaurants are virtues
[35:56.340 --> 35:59.940]  settling down. All the Californians have moved here. They said it was a $50 surcharge if you
[35:59.940 --> 36:03.220]  don't wear a mask. Hey, how about piss off and I leave your filthy restaurant?
[36:05.140 --> 36:09.460]  New study shows nine and 10 COVID patients on ventilators don't make it. Yeah, they always
[36:09.460 --> 36:13.620]  knew they were killing them with the ventilators. 80% of New York City's coronavirus patients who
[36:13.620 --> 36:18.740]  are put on ventilators ultimately die and some doctors are trying to stop using them. I've got
[36:18.740 --> 36:23.540]  even more to hit on this, but I want to get Chris guy who's been holding patiently the last 10
[36:23.540 --> 36:30.580]  minutes on. I really appreciate him spending time with us on Saturday. He's got a lot of hashtags,
[36:30.580 --> 36:36.020]  a lot of great websites. He's a major leader thought leader when it comes to opposing all this
[36:36.020 --> 36:40.340]  and after he leaves us, I'm going to air the five minute clip in September that went viral
[36:40.340 --> 36:43.700]  with tens of millions of views of them predicting everything that would come in the future.
[36:48.100 --> 36:51.860]  You don't need a mask. The mask is about compliance because they know Canadians like
[36:51.860 --> 36:55.540]  to do what they're told. So they tell you, you have to wear a mask. Next, they're going to tell
[36:55.540 --> 36:59.300]  you, you have to contact trace. Then they're going to tell you, you have to take the vaccine.
[36:59.300 --> 37:03.140]  And because Canadians like to do what they're told, they're hoping that everyone just complies.
[37:03.140 --> 37:07.940]  And then guess what, kids, once you take your vaccine, like a dumb person that doesn't know
[37:07.940 --> 37:12.580]  any better, they're going to tell you, sorry, the vaccine isn't as effective as we thought it was
[37:12.580 --> 37:17.300]  going to be. So now you still got to wear a mask, still got to get contact trace, still have all the
[37:17.300 --> 37:25.460]  restrictions and social distancing and still take your vaccine. But right now, tell people that
[37:25.460 --> 37:29.620]  don't know who you are, who you are, tell people the best websites, the new hashtag, because we're
[37:29.620 --> 37:34.420]  not just here, bitching, we're taking action. And then I wanted to give you 20, 30 minutes unfettered
[37:34.420 --> 37:40.420]  commercial free, uh, to actually roll through what you see coming next, how we fight back and what's
[37:40.420 --> 37:44.660]  unfolding. Chris guy, great to have you here. Thanks. It's always a pleasure.
[37:47.380 --> 37:50.180]  Where do you want to start? Tell us about you, about the hashtag,
[37:50.820 --> 37:56.260]  about the websites, how we take action. I've been, I've been one of the main anti-lockdown
[37:57.220 --> 38:01.540]  speakers since the very beginning of this. I've been speaking all around the world. I've spoken
[38:01.540 --> 38:07.940]  at world conferences. Uh, so I'm very, I'm very well versed on the situation. I have an Instagram
[38:07.940 --> 38:14.500]  that's my main avenue of giving out my information. It's at real Chris sky. And I also have a Twitter
[38:14.500 --> 38:24.820]  at Chris Saccocho one that C H R I S and that's S a C C O C C I A one. And other than that,
[38:24.820 --> 38:29.620]  I've just been trying to wake people up. I started two nonprofits. My first nonprofit is going to be
[38:29.620 --> 38:36.820]  very relevant. Now it's called back to work. And the idea was to create a legal fund, a legal team,
[38:36.820 --> 38:42.980]  and an actual fund, an actual, an actual fund for businesses that they could have, they could use
[38:42.980 --> 38:47.940]  when they need to fight these fines that they're getting for opening the idea behind it was get an
[38:47.940 --> 38:52.740]  entire group of businesses to open, have enough money in this fund and a legal team to represent
[38:52.740 --> 38:57.540]  them so they could fight off the fines, stay open and other businesses would see this and open as
[38:57.540 --> 39:03.380]  well. I made it way back in April last year. And when I made it, I said, this isn't for the first
[39:03.380 --> 39:08.260]  wave. This isn't for the second wave. This is for the third wave. And the third wave is now. And why
[39:08.260 --> 39:12.580]  did I say that is because I knew in the first wave businesses were just going to ride it out. They
[39:12.580 --> 39:16.180]  could say two weeks over and over and over and over again. And people would just, they wouldn't
[39:16.180 --> 39:20.500]  want to fight the government, but it came to the second wave. Some people were still, a lot of
[39:20.500 --> 39:24.900]  people were on the fence, but still not motivated to maneuver and do this because they didn't want
[39:24.900 --> 39:30.020]  to go up against the government. Now, when it comes to the third wave, the third wave is so obvious,
[39:30.020 --> 39:35.060]  so obvious, especially since people like me were telling people it was coming after we already had
[39:35.060 --> 39:40.260]  predictions that came through. People were so, they were ready for it. So now that the government's
[39:40.260 --> 39:45.780]  announcing that it's here, they realize finally that this isn't about their safety. This is about
[39:45.780 --> 39:52.020]  control. And when they make that determination and they change that perception just a little bit,
[39:52.020 --> 39:57.380]  it changes everything because now all the propaganda on TV does not affect them. They're
[39:57.380 --> 40:03.140]  no longer afraid. Now they're only afraid of losing their business, losing their house,
[40:03.140 --> 40:08.660]  losing their livelihood, and they're worried about their family's future. That's what I was waiting
[40:08.660 --> 40:14.100]  for. I was waiting for necessity to overcome fear. And I believe we've reached that point.
[40:14.100 --> 40:19.060]  So I'm going to be using back to work a lot in the next coming months, because I'm going to try
[40:19.060 --> 40:25.060]  to organize a grand reopening of businesses. We're going to provide them funding, a legal team. We're
[40:25.060 --> 40:28.900]  going to provide them private security. We're going to provide them everything they need to
[40:28.900 --> 40:32.740]  thwart off the illegal intrusions of the government. And again, Chris, explain this to people,
[40:32.740 --> 40:35.460]  if you're in Texas or a few other places and you're somewhat open, you're like, oh,
[40:35.460 --> 40:39.620]  I don't care if they're closed. That's going to cause a worldwide depression. And the globalists
[40:39.620 --> 40:43.460]  are going to get to us next with new bio weapons that are actually real. They're going to release.
[40:43.460 --> 40:46.820]  We've got to destroy this hoax. Now we've got to discredit this hoax now.
[40:47.940 --> 40:53.860]  Well, yes, exactly. And the, the idea, especially in Canada, our economy is so dependent on our
[40:53.860 --> 40:58.820]  small businesses. 70% of all our jobs come from small businesses. There was about 1.1,
[40:58.820 --> 41:02.180]  5 million small businesses in all of Canada. At the start of this whole thing,
[41:02.180 --> 41:08.740]  we've lost around 300,000, 300,000, and we have another few hundred thousand that are just on
[41:08.740 --> 41:13.860]  the brink. And this third wave will push them out. If you lose four or 500,000 businesses,
[41:13.860 --> 41:19.300]  that's losing almost half of our jobs. And these are businesses and jobs that are never
[41:19.860 --> 41:26.420]  coming back. Let that sink in people never coming back. So you end up with a double digit reduction
[41:26.420 --> 41:32.260]  in GDP. That's basically permanent. You end up with millions, if not tens of millions of job
[41:32.260 --> 41:38.020]  losses, and you end up with tens of millions of people that were once independent and providing
[41:38.020 --> 41:42.260]  GDP who are now dependent on government to survive and the newest collectors of their
[41:42.260 --> 41:46.500]  universal basic income that they're trying to push through. That's what they're trying to do.
[41:46.500 --> 41:50.900]  And there will be no recovery. They keep telling you, we're going to have this wonderful bounce.
[41:50.900 --> 41:56.340]  How can there be a bounce when they open you in phases and you go from not being able to open to
[41:56.340 --> 42:01.300]  a 10% capacity and then maybe a month later, you're at 20% capacity and then sure enough,
[42:01.300 --> 42:06.660]  they're going to lock you back down again. No, the idea here is to strangle people and literally
[42:06.660 --> 42:12.580]  suffocate them slowly to the point where they literally don't move. They'll just sit there and
[42:12.580 --> 42:17.300]  lose their business. We've already seen hundreds of thousands of people literally lost their
[42:17.300 --> 42:22.180]  businesses rather than just try to open. People are so scared of a piece of paper and a fine that
[42:22.180 --> 42:27.140]  will never hold up in court. I want everybody to know that. Every emergency order fine, whether
[42:27.140 --> 42:30.820]  it's for opening your business, whether it was for having a party, whether it was for declining
[42:30.820 --> 42:36.260]  quarantine or testing at the airport, all of those fines and tickets will be thrown right out of
[42:36.260 --> 42:40.660]  court because they're a complete violation of our charter of rights and freedoms in Canada.
[42:40.660 --> 42:43.780]  And they're a complete violation of your constitutional rights in the United States
[42:43.780 --> 42:48.660]  of America. Thankfully, that's why we live in these countries because we have rights and we
[42:48.660 --> 42:52.740]  have freedoms and they're trying to make people forget that. And they're trying to make people
[42:52.740 --> 42:56.500]  believe that those are irrelevant and that the government can just supersede them or take them
[42:56.500 --> 43:00.740]  away. It doesn't work like that. And that's why I keep making videos to demonstrate that. The most
[43:00.740 --> 43:04.820]  reason one was when they sent an entire police force to my house to try to legally arrest me
[43:04.820 --> 43:08.420]  and it didn't work out the way they wanted. In fact, it was pretty embarrassing for them.
[43:08.420 --> 43:13.380]  So I wanted to make videos like that to inspire people, to let them know that they need to do the
[43:13.380 --> 43:17.220]  same type of thing, but in a different way. If you own a business, you need to open it.
[43:18.420 --> 43:24.100]  We had one man, his name is Adam Skelly. He opened his barbecue place. He was inspired by me
[43:24.100 --> 43:28.180]  because he was a frequent person at the protest. And he was actually there the day I made that
[43:28.180 --> 43:33.140]  prediction video, September 26th. And he heard it and he came up to me and he said, I own three
[43:33.140 --> 43:36.740]  restaurants. He's like, are they really going to lock us down by end of November? I said,
[43:36.740 --> 43:40.820]  you better believe they are. He said, well, if they do, I'm going to stay open. There was that
[43:40.820 --> 43:45.780]  day right there. On that day, he saw that interview, Adam Skelly of, of, of Adamson's
[43:45.780 --> 43:50.580]  barbecue came over and he said, if that happens and they try to close us down, I'm going to stay
[43:50.580 --> 43:55.380]  open. And I told him, if you stay open, I'll be there. And sure enough, he stayed open. And for
[43:55.380 --> 44:00.980]  three days we fought off the police with thousands of people there. It took the third day, the third
[44:00.980 --> 44:08.500]  day, what they had done, they had put a special emergency police order out for a special police
[44:08.500 --> 44:12.740]  job. And I got the, I got a document sent to me by someone in the Toronto police force because
[44:12.740 --> 44:18.340]  they offered him the job. It was an overnight job. They were paying emergency pay times three,
[44:18.340 --> 44:24.580]  and they needed officers to stand guard at Adam Skelly's place overnight. And we didn't know why,
[44:24.580 --> 44:28.820]  but I figured it out. They were getting the locks and stuff changed at his own place.
[44:28.820 --> 44:33.620]  He owned the building. He owned the land, but under the so-called emergency act,
[44:33.620 --> 44:40.180]  all they needed was a little signed order from Eileen Davila, our, our so-called chief health
[44:40.180 --> 44:44.820]  expert whose husband got arrested for ties to AstraZeneca, by the way, I'm just gonna throw
[44:44.820 --> 44:48.180]  that out there. And they're not reporting on it in mainstream media, but in any case,
[44:48.740 --> 44:53.060]  she just wrote a little thing that said you were in violation of our, our new emergency orders.
[44:53.060 --> 44:59.940]  So we're confiscating your property. So like a communist country, they literally came overnight,
[44:59.940 --> 45:04.340]  changed the locks on a building that he owned and gave him a notice in the morning that said,
[45:04.340 --> 45:09.060]  we now own your building. We now own the property and you're not definitely allowed to open. If you
[45:09.060 --> 45:15.300]  enter your premise, it will be trespassing. And they literally sent the Calvary horse mounted
[45:15.300 --> 45:20.500]  police with dozens of other police. And they tried to surround the building. Well, Adam Skelly was a
[45:20.500 --> 45:26.100]  warrior and he snuck in through a window and from the inside of his own building, he had to kick
[45:26.100 --> 45:31.540]  down a door cause they didn't just lock it. They literally bolted them shut. So from the inside,
[45:31.540 --> 45:36.340]  he kicked this door down. And when the door came flying open, it almost hit a cop in the face. I
[45:36.340 --> 45:40.340]  actually had to stop the door from hitting a police officer in the face. And then we use that
[45:40.340 --> 45:46.660]  little sec to slide in there about 20 of us. And we closed the door back or we had people
[45:47.540 --> 45:50.660]  block the door off from the police cause the door was broken at that point.
[45:50.660 --> 45:54.180]  And we started serving brisket inside to make a point.
[45:54.180 --> 45:58.420]  And let me guess, this has made the restaurant way more popular than ever. Fighting back is
[45:58.420 --> 46:04.260]  rewarding. You don't lose doing it. You win do it. Only way you lose is submitting a whole cashless
[46:04.260 --> 46:08.740]  society, vertical integration. Let's talk about this. This is the Rockefeller Foundation. I'm
[46:08.740 --> 46:14.020]  going to show documents after you leave us. Controlling the UN, controlling China,
[46:14.020 --> 46:20.180]  telling all your local governments what to do. And then meanwhile, Florida never closed
[46:21.140 --> 46:24.500]  other than some blue cities that refuse the governor's orders. And they had the lowest
[46:24.500 --> 46:28.820]  COVID rates, lowest COVID deaths, and are now booming more than any other state in the union.
[46:28.820 --> 46:33.940]  And Texas has now gone into third place. It's absolutely disgusting what our governor did.
[46:33.940 --> 46:37.140]  We know he's on the globalist payroll. So a year into the pandemic,
[46:37.140 --> 46:41.140]  Florida's booming and Republican governor DeSantis is taking credit. So, so again,
[46:41.140 --> 46:47.060]  this totally backfire when anybody stands up, that's what happens. And it's so sad what's
[46:47.060 --> 46:51.860]  happening in areas of Canada, especially French areas and in areas of Europe. Why,
[46:52.420 --> 46:55.860]  why is it certain areas are under total lockdown? Other areas, they don't try it.
[46:55.860 --> 46:58.260]  I think it's because they've done psychological testing. They admit they have
[46:59.460 --> 47:06.420]  and no, it's not going to go over 100%. There's, it's not an accident that Toronto and New York,
[47:06.420 --> 47:13.940]  two docile and very liberal cities are on strict lockdowns and places like Florida and Texas,
[47:13.940 --> 47:19.940]  who love guns, love freedom, are basically free and open. It's a complete, the government will
[47:19.940 --> 47:24.580]  do whatever you allow them to do. Everything that's happening right now is because Canadians
[47:24.580 --> 47:29.140]  and Americans are allowing it in their own respective states. If they said no,
[47:29.140 --> 47:32.500]  it wouldn't happen. And that's what, that's what we're trying to do. We're trying to make these
[47:32.500 --> 47:35.620]  businesses say no, like Adam did. And I just want to finish up what happened with him because I
[47:35.620 --> 47:40.420]  don't want people to think it's hopeless because they came that day. They said they had confiscated
[47:40.420 --> 47:44.340]  his property. They, they came and they actually arrested him right beside me while we were serving
[47:44.340 --> 47:48.980]  the brisket in his restaurant. And they stuck him with like a bill for 175 grand. They were
[47:48.980 --> 47:53.620]  going to try to make them pay. He started a GoFundMe. It took about three days to get
[47:53.620 --> 47:58.980]  almost $400,000 in there. So he had more than enough money to pay his lawyers, fight this charge
[47:58.980 --> 48:02.580]  and already in court. They're going to have to not let it go to court. If it goes to court.
[48:02.820 --> 48:08.180]  And again, though, I'm glad you're covering microcosmos, Chris, but listen, folks, it's a plan.
[48:09.140 --> 48:12.500]  It's always been a plan. It's not just you up there predicting it cause you have their documents
[48:12.500 --> 48:18.260]  I'm not taking away from you. It's that it's an admitted formula. Explain to people what they've
[48:18.260 --> 48:25.380]  done so far. And then in a nutshell, where they will take us if we submit versus how you see us
[48:25.380 --> 48:31.620]  defeating them. Cause I say we go on the offense and look, it's great news. 25 countries in Europe
[48:31.620 --> 48:37.700]  have banned the AstraZeneca. A bunch of others like India have banned the MRNA, Pfizer. There's
[48:37.700 --> 48:41.300]  mass death everywhere. People are waking up. So I go back to the question, let me ask you,
[48:41.940 --> 48:45.700]  let's do it a piece at a time. You're a smart guy and I really want your band. And people always
[48:45.700 --> 48:48.740]  say, don't worry about psychopaths. Don't worry why they do it. Well, that little criminology,
[48:48.740 --> 48:53.620]  I need to know why is Bill Gates and the UN and the Rockefeller Foundation, I have the documents
[48:53.620 --> 48:58.020]  where they ran the whole thing. Why are they doing something so bold and reckless? I mean,
[48:58.020 --> 49:01.620]  they knew this would kill people. They know it won't protect you. They know it's going to
[49:01.620 --> 49:06.260]  give rise to real viruses. I mean, they are just mad dog crazy. And the answer is they
[49:06.260 --> 49:10.580]  want to kill people. They're psychos, they're eugenicists, and this is the best way they can
[49:10.580 --> 49:14.100]  do it. And they think they're going to get away with it. And their whole global assistant was
[49:14.100 --> 49:18.900]  already in so much trouble. They are mad that Epstein got busted with Bill Gates. And so now
[49:18.900 --> 49:24.420]  they're doing this to make us not think about the other crimes they've committed. Well, the way you
[49:24.420 --> 49:28.900]  kill a story is with another story. But I got to tell you, this hasn't worked. Mainline people I
[49:28.900 --> 49:34.180]  know. I walk into restaurants and I go, do we all hate Bill Gates? People go, yeah, we hate him. I
[49:34.180 --> 49:38.020]  walk into a short door today to buy some t-shirts. So I've gotten so fat again, I need to get bigger
[49:38.020 --> 49:41.780]  ones. And everybody's like, Alex Jones, high five me. And I go, screw Bill Gates. They're like,
[49:41.780 --> 49:46.660]  yeah, screw Bill Gates. I mean, do they realize that they've taken themselves from one crisis
[49:46.660 --> 49:53.140]  and gone into something much worse or am I wrong? Well, it's all about two things,
[49:53.140 --> 49:58.500]  power, control, and money is part of that. But that's what they're doing all of this for.
[49:58.500 --> 50:03.860]  And they're using medicine because people trust medicine. So that's why they're trying to impose
[50:03.860 --> 50:10.820]  this medical tyranny where basically medical law is now replacing actual law and replacing even
[50:10.820 --> 50:14.660]  our rights and freedoms. Exactly. They're bringing in world government, corporate law,
[50:14.660 --> 50:19.620]  corporate governance through medical tyranny. Bingo. That's it. That's the number one thing
[50:19.620 --> 50:24.420]  that people need to realize. And that's why they're using this idea of a virus and an idea
[50:24.420 --> 50:28.980]  of a pandemic. And the idea that everything they're doing is for your safety, because it
[50:28.980 --> 50:35.060]  makes it much harder to resist. It makes it a lot easier to comply. And then they do it in ways
[50:35.060 --> 50:40.420]  that they make it small little stages. So you think you're doing the right thing and you think
[50:41.300 --> 50:46.340]  you're trying to help. And they use psychological warfare on you to believe that if you don't do
[50:46.420 --> 50:51.940]  exactly as you're told you're going to die or you're part of the problem, it's 100%
[50:51.940 --> 50:56.740]  psychological warfare. And by the time they get the vaccine out, it's going to turn into
[50:56.740 --> 51:00.980]  actual warfare because when they're taking something and forcing it into your body against
[51:00.980 --> 51:05.700]  your will, it's not psychological anymore. It's physical warfare. That's right. So why are they
[51:05.700 --> 51:11.540]  doing this? And again, you're just expanding on that. Why not? What do people that have power want
[51:12.100 --> 51:17.460]  more power? And what do they want? Want? They don't want to be able to lose that power
[51:17.460 --> 51:21.220]  right now. They're outnumbered right now. People are waking up to what they're doing.
[51:21.220 --> 51:25.700]  So they're only there. And so the elite has launched a chicken little fear mongering
[51:25.700 --> 51:30.500]  operation, but with it, they get you to opt into taking a soft kill weapon that damages you,
[51:30.500 --> 51:34.260]  weighs down your family and wrecks society while consolidating power and money for them,
[51:34.260 --> 51:39.620]  which has all happened, which is wonderfully convenient for them. Is it not? They set up
[51:39.620 --> 51:45.060]  society. So you have no choice, but to follow the medical dictates of the state,
[51:45.060 --> 51:49.220]  which now will say you need to take four COVID vaccines a year. And who else knows what other
[51:49.220 --> 51:52.100]  kinds of vaccines are going to come up with? Cause they're probably going to make a whole
[51:52.100 --> 51:56.580]  immunization schedule for adults by the time, by the time they get, uh, by the time they get this
[51:56.580 --> 52:01.380]  done, but they're going to tell you the medical dictate of the state is you can not live your
[52:01.380 --> 52:06.900]  life. You can not travel. You can not work. You can not congregate unless you submit to our
[52:06.900 --> 52:10.980]  forced medical procedures. This is going to backfire on the medical system massively.
[52:10.980 --> 52:15.220]  So let's talk about where will they take us? You're where will they take us? If we submit
[52:15.220 --> 52:17.940]  versus where we're really going to go and how you see them being defeated.
[52:18.900 --> 52:25.540]  If we submit, if you keep complying, the end game is the vaccine passport. That is their end game
[52:25.540 --> 52:29.540]  right now. Cause once they get you under the vaccine passport with medical tyranny
[52:29.540 --> 52:33.940]  and they expand the vaccine passport to other facets of your life, guess what?
[52:33.940 --> 52:38.260]  Now they introduce digital currency and they're going to put it together with your vaccine
[52:38.260 --> 52:42.900]  passport, which is now a digital biometric identity. Walmart, China, they're all on board
[52:43.780 --> 52:46.580]  a hundred percent. Of course they're on board. It's a wonderful way to track you. It's a
[52:46.580 --> 52:50.980]  wonderful way to control you. And then once they have a digital currency and everything tied to
[52:50.980 --> 52:56.020]  your biometric vaccine passport digitally, you'll have to like literally scan at first.
[52:56.020 --> 53:00.420]  It'll be you scanning your phone or whatever other gadget you have to get into certain places.
[53:00.500 --> 53:04.980]  Eventually you'll be scanning yourself. And then not only are you a commodity,
[53:04.980 --> 53:12.260]  you're no longer even a human being. Every single transaction you try to do will have to be tracked,
[53:12.260 --> 53:19.140]  traced, taxed, and approved by the state. Even if you want to sell a pair of shoes on Kijiji,
[53:19.700 --> 53:25.380]  they will know about it. And then once they have all that, the final, final nail in the coffin for
[53:25.460 --> 53:30.820]  society forever will be the social credit score. Because that's how they keep everyone in line
[53:30.820 --> 53:34.820]  after they have you on their full system where they have complete control over you.
[53:34.820 --> 53:38.900]  Because now you can take a picture with someone like me or you, Alex, and your social credit
[53:38.900 --> 53:42.180]  score is going to drop. If it drops to a certain point, you won't be able to travel.
[53:42.180 --> 53:46.660]  And that's what's key. What you just said is absolutely key. They aren't just getting this
[53:46.660 --> 53:51.300]  to get control. Once they have the control grid in, it'll be more and more you've got to do to
[53:51.300 --> 53:55.220]  comply. You've got to sterilize your kids. You've got to send yourself for communist training.
[53:55.220 --> 54:00.020]  You've got to stop eating real meat. It's all a social credit score where you get rewarded.
[54:00.020 --> 54:03.380]  And then they hold up the first group that does what they're told. They give them a big reward.
[54:03.380 --> 54:08.260]  But by the end of it, you don't get any reward. That's right. The only reward is being allowed
[54:08.260 --> 54:13.460]  to live under their conditions, which are horrible living conditions. So if you want that kind of
[54:13.460 --> 54:19.380]  life where you have to take an inoculation multiple times a year, where you have your
[54:19.380 --> 54:25.220]  identity, your medical history, your vaccine history, your work, everything on a little chip,
[54:25.220 --> 54:29.300]  including your bank account information that the state can turn off at any time.
[54:30.020 --> 54:33.380]  If you want to live like that, just keep complying with everything they're saying.
[54:33.380 --> 54:39.780]  If you want a free society like what you had before, but even better, become more aware and
[54:39.780 --> 54:45.220]  start asking more questions and stop complying with things that are not in your best interest.
[54:45.220 --> 54:49.780]  If you don't ask questions, you can't know if something's good for you or not. And they're
[54:49.780 --> 54:53.700]  telling you asking questions is bad. Of course, they're telling you that because they're lying
[54:53.700 --> 54:58.740]  to you. Nobody who's telling you a lie wants to ask questions because it's going to expose their
[54:58.740 --> 55:02.820]  lie. And that's why we're telling people to ask questions about the vaccine. By the way,
[55:02.820 --> 55:08.020]  did you see the NAACP New York head say, I'm not asking questions, what's in it? I'm not reading,
[55:08.020 --> 55:12.500]  just take the infusion. I mean, you talk about a cult programming. That's Jim Jones,
[55:12.500 --> 55:17.460]  drink the Kool-Aid. And this is crazy. That's ridiculous. How can somebody,
[55:17.460 --> 55:21.860]  especially doctors right now, nine out of 10 doctors, I won't say all doctors,
[55:21.860 --> 55:25.540]  I know some doctors personally that are telling their patients do not take the vaccine. I'm not
[55:25.540 --> 55:29.380]  taking it and I commend them, but they're still not going public and saying it. They're just
[55:29.380 --> 55:33.700]  saying it behind closed doors, but nine out of 10 doctors are telling their patients,
[55:33.700 --> 55:39.300]  I recommend this vaccine. It's safe and it's effective. How can they say that when you ask
[55:39.300 --> 55:44.020]  your doctor, doctor, is this vaccine FDA approved? The doctor is going to say, no.
[55:44.020 --> 55:48.420]  When you say doctor, has this passed human clinical trials? They're going to say, no,
[55:48.420 --> 55:54.260]  it's currently ongoing. When you say doctor, do we even have any long-term safety or efficacy data
[55:54.260 --> 56:00.420]  on this vaccine at all, or even short-term? No. So then doctor, why are you telling me it's safe
[56:00.420 --> 56:03.860]  and why are you recommending it? I don't think they'll be able to answer that question.
[56:04.820 --> 56:09.700]  We got rid of Christianity, which became a virtue signal. I'm a Christian personally,
[56:09.700 --> 56:15.220]  God's real, but it became a state-run garbage thing where you go and show how good you are,
[56:15.220 --> 56:20.260]  like a bunch of Pharisees. And so now there's no Christianity really. So now it's, I wear a mask,
[56:20.260 --> 56:25.140]  I virtue signal, I'm racist. White people are bad. It's a new religion. And they admit that
[56:25.140 --> 56:29.060]  political correctness is a religion. They admit this in their white papers, but it's a religion
[56:29.060 --> 56:34.180]  where Apple runs slave camps and the globalists don't pay taxes, but then they call for
[56:34.180 --> 56:38.660]  reparations for black people while they're killing black people with poison vaccines.
[56:38.660 --> 56:43.300]  And so, as you said, this is becoming physical. It was a psyop. Now they're coming violently at us.
[56:43.300 --> 56:46.660]  But in case you're a new viewer and think I'm joking, because I know it sounds crazy.
[56:46.660 --> 56:52.500]  Here's the head of the NAACP in Long Island, New York. And this is what she said.
[56:53.220 --> 56:57.060]  I'm not asking what's in the, in the, in the infusion,
[56:58.740 --> 57:05.940]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion. I am sticking out my arm
[57:06.660 --> 57:12.660]  and I am taking the infusion. I'm not asking what's in the, in the, in the infusion.
[57:14.340 --> 57:21.620]  I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion. I am sticking out my arm
[57:22.420 --> 57:28.020]  and I am taking the infusion. By the way, guys, I, the other day, somebody accused us of that,
[57:28.020 --> 57:32.500]  that was edited. I went and found, uh, like her three minute speech and I meant to send it to you
[57:32.500 --> 57:36.740]  guys. And I think I sent it to Daria if she's not here today. Will you guys please go get the full,
[57:36.740 --> 57:41.300]  it's about three minutes and 10 seconds of, if, if, if my memory serves, she gets up there and
[57:41.300 --> 57:45.460]  runs her mouth and thanks everybody and says how great they are now. They're all heroes.
[57:45.460 --> 57:48.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to tell you something bottom line.
[57:48.020 --> 57:53.860]  My dad was top of his class. He was going to UT when he was 16 years old.
[57:54.580 --> 58:00.180]  They worked at cancer research facility in Houston. He got recruited. He got out of it.
[58:00.180 --> 58:04.500]  By the time he was in college, they told him point blank range. It's all about eugenics.
[58:04.500 --> 58:07.860]  It's all about getting rid of poor people that includes black folks.
[58:07.860 --> 58:13.460]  And my dad didn't tell me about that till I was, my gosh, I was like 30 years old. My dad told me
[58:13.460 --> 58:17.860]  all that. And I knew that he was, you know, in high school, went to college and was at cancer
[58:17.860 --> 58:21.780]  research and they recruited him into this stuff because they recruit all the top students into it.
[58:21.780 --> 58:26.900]  He got out of it, but we all know about Tuskegee. And so imagine this older black woman,
[58:26.900 --> 58:30.980]  who's old enough to have been in Tuskegee, tens of thousands of blacks, given syphilis,
[58:30.980 --> 58:35.460]  allowed to spread it to themselves and everybody else. You know how horrible syphilis death is.
[58:35.460 --> 58:40.340]  It's a microscopic worm folks. It eats your brain, eats your organs, makes you become criminally
[58:40.340 --> 58:45.860]  insane. They found out a lot of the homicidal old black men and people that it takes decades to do
[58:45.860 --> 58:54.020]  it, that were actually in prisons and actually killed people from the syphilis derangement that
[58:54.020 --> 58:58.740]  they had. Jack the Ripper, they killed all those women. They, they, they believe had syphilis. So
[58:58.740 --> 59:03.540]  a Hitler, they believe had syphilis. Al Capone had syphilis. One reason he was so vicious and
[59:03.540 --> 59:10.180]  all that. And so we know this. So the idea, Chris sky that we should, and she's saying what
[59:10.180 --> 59:14.100]  they're saying, they're on the news saying, don't ask questions. It's safe and effective,
[59:14.100 --> 59:17.780]  but they admit it's not safe and effective. So where do you see all this going?
[59:18.900 --> 59:23.700]  Well, it's going in two very different directions. It's obvious that society is now going to be
[59:23.700 --> 59:29.140]  completely divided along the lines of who wants the vaccine and who doesn't. And that's why it's
[59:29.140 --> 59:34.740]  so important that I created that hashtag that just say no campaign, because if they can get
[59:34.740 --> 59:40.580]  75% compliance in this vaccine and they will do it by so many coercion, they'll try to force
[59:40.580 --> 59:43.860]  military to take it. They'll try to force frontline workers to take it. They'll try
[59:43.860 --> 59:48.260]  to force teachers and nurses and everyone else to take it. They'll try to make it compulsory
[59:48.260 --> 59:52.820]  for school children. And at that point, it's going to be, it's going to be a lot of compliance.
[59:52.820 --> 59:56.500]  And then we have a whole bunch of the population. That's just like that lady that said, she's not
[59:56.500 --> 01:00:01.540]  going to ask questions. She's going to stick out her arm. So it's a lot of work to try to get at
[01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:08.020]  least a quarter of this population to ask questions and say, I'm not taking this vaccine.
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:13.540]  I can see where this is going. I don't want a vaccine passport. I do not want medical tyranny
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:20.580]  imposed upon me. I want to be able to control what goes in my body. And I want to retain my freedoms,
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:25.780]  period. And that's where this is going. We're going to have literally a complete chasm of
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:29.540]  society where there's going to be these people that believe in the vaccine and are in complete
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:33.300]  denial of what's really going on. And then there's going to be this group of society
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:37.140]  that actually will not take the vaccine, understands that this is all about control
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:42.740]  and not their safety. And it's our job, our job, especially people like you with a giant platform,
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:47.700]  to get these people to realize that you've got to be on the right side. And the right side is
[01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:54.740]  not taking the vaccine, rejecting medical tyranny, rejecting a global tyranny with a digital currency.
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:01:01.060]  These are all things that everybody, if they understood, would be against. The only reason
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:05.780]  these people are on the side of taking the vaccine and the vaccine passport and all the
[01:01:05.780 --> 01:01:09.380]  rest is because, like the woman in the video, they refuse to ask questions.
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:14.580]  Well, that's my next point. That's my next question is the only way they can get away
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:18.820]  with this is with total silencing of the people so they can try to restrict an Alex Jones.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:23.060]  But if all the viewers out there become Chris Sky, start an Instagram, start a Facebook,
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:27.220]  start a Twitter, go to the areas where they're all masked up. And with a bullhorn,
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:32.820]  lovingly educate people, hand out articles, hand out URLs, explain that bacterial pneumonia
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:38.020]  is caused by masks. Explain that Bill Gates is the number one cause of polio worldwide.
[01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:44.020]  Give them Reuters articles, give them AP articles. And you might only talk to 20 people at a store,
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:48.580]  but you put that online, it'll go viral. Or even if it gets a hundred views, that's huge.
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:54.260]  And so how we stop the sensors is the average viewer or listener becoming that Chris Sky. So
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:58.980]  that's why you said you were listening to me back when you were a young teenager and we helped
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:04.420]  influence you. That is wonderful. Now you're influencing so many people. And I know you've
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:08.900]  been arrested, you've been persecuted some, but let me guess, are you not more enriched now?
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:12.580]  Are you not happier now or were you already politically involved? What has it been like
[01:02:12.580 --> 01:02:16.820]  for you sticking your neck out? Well, I was never really politically involved
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:21.380]  and to me, I'm still not politically involved cause this transcends politics to me. This is
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:27.380]  not about left, right, in Canada, conservative or liberal or Republican or Democrat. This is about
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:32.500]  freedom and rights. And that applies to every single person regardless of their political
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:37.540]  affiliation. So to me, I'm still not a political person. I'm just an activist for rights and
[01:02:37.540 --> 01:02:44.340]  freedom and for the common man. And I'm doing that out of necessity. And do I like being targeted?
[01:02:44.340 --> 01:02:48.660]  Not really. Did I like coming home and have 40 cops at my house trying to illegally arrest me?
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:53.380]  Definitely not. But in a way- But that makes you know that you're a man of substance, a man of
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:57.300]  reality, a man of destiny. I mean, you're there cause you're important, buddy.
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:02.420]  And it means I'm over target. If what I was doing wasn't having an impact, they would be leaving me
[01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:07.060]  alone. They would just be ignoring me. They'd be letting me spin my wheels. It's not an accident
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:13.460]  that I predicted the third wave. I predicted the vaccine passport and I started the Just Say No
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:17.620]  campaign just a couple of days before they came to my house to try to illegally arrest me.
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:22.180]  No, obviously it's to try to stop me, stop that campaign and stop everything that I'm planning
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:27.300]  on doing with opening the businesses. The three things they have on us right now is our masks,
[01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:31.780]  our closed businesses, and this idea with the vaccine that they keep putting in people's heads,
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:34.580]  you have to take it to go back to normal. You have to take it to go back to normal.
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.580]  You have to take it- No, you don't have to take it-
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:40.420]  And if you notice the bait and switch though, whether it's Australia, Europe, the US, Canada,
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:43.940]  they go, actually, once you take it, you don't go back to normal. They're never going to let you
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:48.180]  out of this voluntarily, folks. That's right. That's what people need to understand. You're
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:52.660]  not getting out of this by complying. The more you comply, the deeper you get into it. The only way
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:58.420]  you will ever get out of any of it, any one of these restrictions is by simply not complying to
[01:03:58.420 --> 01:04:02.020]  it. They will never- How did black folks finally get their civil rights in this country by not
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:06.740]  submitting? How do we get the British off our backs not submitting? You got to stop submitting.
[01:04:07.700 --> 01:04:11.300]  That's all it is. Everything they tell you, it's like you said at the beginning of the
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:15.860]  show while I was waiting on the line, everything they're telling you is to make you despair,
[01:04:15.860 --> 01:04:23.700]  to make you sad, hopeless, depressed, weak. Why? So you won't fight back. If you're in that state
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:27.860]  of mind, you will literally just sit there and take it. That's why they don't want gyms open.
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:31.700]  95% of the people I see that are against us that are anti-lockdown that are speaking up,
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:36.820]  they're physically active people. They're not just active people on social media. They're
[01:04:36.820 --> 01:04:40.740]  active in their general life. And that's why they're trying to stifle every aspect of your
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:44.820]  life because it stifles your energy, your frequency. That's right. They want lower energy.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:49.300]  They want to depress us. And that's even in the Facebook and Twitter and Google documents came out
[01:04:49.300 --> 01:04:53.380]  where they want to make us depressed. They want to make us alone. So we only interface with them.
[01:04:53.380 --> 01:05:00.660]  This is literally vampiric. Yeah. Like you said, it's psychological warfare 101. And now they have
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:05.380]  the population, the majority of them right where they want them. But at the same time,
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:11.060]  every single day, they're losing people to the truth because you can tell a lie a million times.
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:15.540]  Someone only has to tell the truth one time and it hits you right here and it wakes you up.
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:20.500]  Whether you want to believe it or not, you're inside, you know the truth. So now it's up to you
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:24.340]  whether you want to tell other people or you want to keep it to yourself. But at that point,
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:28.980]  you can't go back to sleep. So they might have got everyone with their lives initially,
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:33.300]  but every single day that goes by, they're losing support. They are getting exposed.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:38.260]  Absolutely. They launched this as their Hail Mary, that there's no doubt they're in deep trouble.
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:42.180]  And again, I'm not going to tell you folks we're winning for no reason. We're culturally winning.
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:46.020]  Humanity's coming together. That's why they're screaming racism everywhere. That's why they're
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:50.500]  cherry picking events. That's because their humanity is coming together and they can't stand it.
[01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:55.860]  It's true. It's exactly right. Humanity is coming together in what they fear more than anything,
[01:05:55.860 --> 01:06:03.620]  and that's united non-compliance. When the entire population unites for a common good,
[01:06:03.620 --> 01:06:09.460]  a genuine cause. Oh, but look at Newsome. We won't reopen till two million Latinos take the shot.
[01:06:09.460 --> 01:06:15.380]  He loves you Latinos. He wants you to have it first, just like Gardasil absolutely sterilized
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:19.940]  millions of Mexican women. I mean, this is just insane. I can't even believe they got away with
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:25.140]  that headline. If they wrote something like that in Canada, oh, we're not reopening until we,
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:29.540]  until we get at least 30% of the black that's literally holding people hostage.
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:33.620]  And then the damn vaccines experimental. And look, he looks like a goddamn vampire. Look at him.
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:39.380]  I mean, that's a creepy looking person there, man. And then, and you know what, with these people,
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:46.100]  the book is the cover. Look at, look at Biden. I mean, he's creepy as hell. Look at Kamala.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:49.700]  Looks like a robot. Look at Brian Stelter. What the hell happened to these people?
[01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:57.220]  Well, I I'm of the, I'm of the opinion that they usually, and on purpose, choose people in
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:02.100]  politics that have low morals and low intelligence because they're easy to manipulate. They're easy
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:06.980]  to control. And virtually everyone in politics is controlled. The people that aren't controlled
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:10.900]  have things taken away. They don't want a live people. Yeah. They don't want real people because
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:14.980]  we stand up for humanity. What do you, what's, what's up with your prime minister saying he loves
[01:07:14.980 --> 01:07:19.060]  China's dictatorship and wants to be a dictator. He should have been thrown. It's all these women
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:22.100]  look like they're having orgasms when he says it. What the hell's going on?
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:28.100]  It's it's like Stockholm syndrome. People, he literally said that on video. We actually
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:32.900]  were talking about that on another show. I believe he's like, I admire China's dictatorship.
[01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:39.780]  Any other world leader said that imagine Trump had said that like it would have been on 24 hour loop
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:45.060]  on news channels, but Trudeau says it and he gets a standing ovation. We do not want to be like
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:50.340]  China people. We do not want a dictatorship. We do not want a communist country. We do not want
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:55.460]  to have no rights and not have any control of our life. No, you do not want that. So when someone's
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:07:59.860]  telling you, when your leaders telling you that they admire this dictatorship, that should be
[01:07:59.860 --> 01:08:04.260]  your worst nightmare. You shouldn't be cheering for him just because you like his hair. That's
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:08.100]  right. By the way, I have the clip. I want you to see the raw clip. I want you to see the raw clip.
[01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:12.420]  Chris sky and he'll give us some, some final comments and we're looking visit his sites and
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:17.860]  his hashtag and everybody should get behind it. It's amazing. But here is the NAACP in New York,
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:24.740]  they're in Long Island. Here she is the full thing she said in context for folks that think
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:31.060]  I edited it. We did not. Here it is. Well, thank you very much. It is an honor to be here.
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:41.380]  It is a cold spring day. I am surrounded by clergy and our governor is on long
[01:08:42.740 --> 01:08:44.500]  It's a wonderful, wonderful day.
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:53.540]  You know, Governor, I want to thank you for your leadership. I want to look at you. Yeah,
[01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:57.700]  killing all those old people. 16,000 on great job covering it up murder.
[01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:07.060]  We need you to continue going with this. We need you to be our murder. We need you. Thank you,
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:15.060]  murder. COVID has devastated the state. Long Island continues to be one of the hardest hit
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:23.540]  regions, especially for our black and brown New Yorkers. Oh, like, Hey, Karen, we must take the
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:30.820]  vaccine. I'm going to tell you a personal story off script. Oh, off script today, right after this,
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:37.620]  I am going to have an infusion. And I'm going to have an infusion
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:44.420]  because I want to make sure that the cancer that was in my body does not return.
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:55.060]  I'm not asking what's in the infusion. I'm not looking up all of the ingredients in the infusion.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:10:00.740]  I am sticking out my arm and I am taking the infusion.
[01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:09.700]  And that's what we have to do. Our communities take insulin, metformin,
[01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:20.180]  all kinds of we can line up at the drug store so quickly because we want to save our lives.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:29.700]  And that's what the governor is talking about. We must take the vaccine. The vaccine is a weapon
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:37.300]  that wins the war on COVID. And we need our clergy because, as Martin Luther King said,
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:48.660]  religion and science are not competing interests. They are our trusted messengers.
[01:10:48.660 --> 01:10:54.420]  And when your pastor says to do something, you trust your pastor, you trust your doctor.
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:11:01.940]  That's what we need to do. This shot is the only thing that will get our lives back.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:08.420]  Whichever vaccine is offered to you, there's always gonna be more governor. Our governor
[01:11:09.060 --> 01:11:13.300]  has done an amazing job. Okay, it's basically over how much is left?
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:17.860]  I can't play the rest play the rest just play it for you to take it.
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:27.780]  And we cannot have any excuses at all. We all need to do our part, not just for ourselves,
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:38.660]  but for our families, for our friends, for our community. So Governor, I thank you for being
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:44.820]  great job killing those 16,000 people continuing to lead us through this crisis,
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:49.380]  because we need you. Thank you more deaths 30 place else because he murdered a bunch of
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:53.380]  innocent people. You could talk 10 hours about what she just said on your take off,
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:57.860]  I'm just gonna say this. Oh, why is everybody got quote type one diabetes now because when
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:02.020]  they give little kids vaccines, it causes pancreatitis is the number one cause of type
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:06.100]  one diabetes. They say it's genetic. No, it's not. You kill the little kids pancreas with the
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:10.820]  vaccine. It's in the MMR. It's in it's in all the major vaccines that can cause that and it's
[01:12:10.820 --> 01:12:15.300]  linked directly to it. And then she's talking about old cancer. I get an infusion just like
[01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:19.300]  that. Don't read what's on it. Don't do it. Oh yeah, that chemotherapy is great for you lady.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:23.140]  And of course, the black community is one of the most unhealthy out there because they're under
[01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:27.300]  the government health service. I don't ask him to ski when they give me the syphilis.
[01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:32.580]  I just take the syphilis. So sitting through that three and a half minutes, it's even worse than the
[01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:38.180]  15 second clip we played. Chris Sky, major activist exposing this medical tyranny eugenics
[01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:44.420]  operation run by the eugenicist Bill Gates. What do you make of that statement? It's on par with
[01:12:44.420 --> 01:12:49.460]  any propaganda. I turned on, I never watched the news, but I was at a hotel today. So I was just
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:53.300]  curious to see what CNN was saying for like two minutes. And I knew it was going to be all vaccine
[01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:58.340]  propaganda. And it was literally like an exact script of what she just said. They have their
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:02.260]  talking points and they repeat them and they get as many people to repeat them over and over.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:06.580]  They try to get people like doctors. They try to get people like celebrities. They try to get
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:12.100]  people like your church people to influence you to take the shot. Why? Because they know if you
[01:13:12.100 --> 01:13:15.860]  ask the right questions, there's no way you'll want to take the shot. So that's why they have
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:19.940]  to coerce you. That's why they have to tell you over and over again. And that's why the easiest
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:26.500]  way to beat this, to beat them is with the campaign that I created, the just say no campaign,
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:30.900]  just say no to the COVID vaccine. Where I'm getting everyone to go on their social media,
[01:13:30.900 --> 01:13:36.340]  whether it's Instagram, Facebook, or Twitter, and make a post on their wall that says hashtag
[01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:41.380]  just say no in the post and hashtag just say no in the caption. And if you're on Instagram and
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:46.660]  you want me to follow you and you want me to share that, make it a story post and tag at real Chris
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:52.100]  sky. The idea here is to get millions of people around the world to make their own posts. And you
[01:13:52.100 --> 01:13:55.300]  don't have to just make one. You can make a new one every day if you want, because that's all
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:59.460]  we're going to really flood the internet with these. And we want to show that there's millions
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:03.940]  and millions of people against this vaccine because they use community pressure above all
[01:14:03.940 --> 01:14:08.260]  else to make people take this. It's community leader, the church leader, your doctor are all
[01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:12.660]  telling you to take this vaccine. You're going to be like, wow, I better take this vaccine.
[01:14:12.660 --> 01:14:18.260]  But if all your friends and family are asking the same questions as you that nobody can answer,
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:22.500]  then you're going to be way less likely to take this vaccine. And if we get enough people not to
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:28.180]  take this vaccine, we stop their entire agenda in its tracks people. And let's talk about that. If
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:32.020]  everybody watching this today, because I know, you know, Chris is going to sit down on his
[01:14:32.020 --> 01:14:36.100]  platforms, he's on with us. When this airs at four, it's taped to air, it's almost close to
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:40.500]  four. Now, we got to finish up here in a few minutes. When this goes out, share it, reach out
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:44.740]  to other people. I can't tell you how many prominent people I send messages to saying,
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:48.740]  don't take the vaccine. Here's an example of it killing people. Here's an example of not protecting
[01:14:48.740 --> 01:14:52.900]  folks. And you know, some are green beret, some are Navy SEALs, some are doctors, some are
[01:14:52.900 --> 01:14:57.300]  professors, some are famous. They go, Oh, don't worry, I'm not taking it. And I go, I know,
[01:14:57.300 --> 01:15:01.860]  warn other people. That's the other part of the equation. If everybody gets excited about the
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:07.140]  show today, and shares these links, we're going to wake up hundreds of thousands and then tell them
[01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:13.380]  wake up others as well. It's absolutely vital. And of course, they ban ban.video on Twitter
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:20.980]  and Facebook, we have a new URL, ban this.tv. Can we just blow that URL up so people can see
[01:15:20.980 --> 01:15:30.740]  that on screen guys, ban this.tv. And we'll put that URL on screen for people because it just
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:36.660]  takes you right to band.video. So I want to really thank you for joining us. I want to thank you for
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:41.380]  all the work you're doing. They try to kick people off cyberspace, plug your URLs, and it's in four
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:47.140]  or five minutes. Other key points Chris guy you'd like to tell folks? Well, there's four ways we got
[01:15:47.140 --> 01:15:50.980]  to end this. Number one, we got to reject the vaccine. We got to make people aware of the
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:55.220]  vaccine. That's the most important and most pressing matter because they're planning on
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:16:00.180]  releasing the vaccine passport within a matter of months. They even have the little tracking
[01:16:00.180 --> 01:16:04.100]  bracelets now for quarantine. They brought them out in Israel. They brought them out in Barbados
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:08.260]  and believe me, they want to bring them here. And now they're making a mandatory. Yes. And they gave
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:12.500]  a grant to a company of over two and a half million dollars to produce them. And they come
[01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:17.300]  with hefty fines attached to them. But the other, okay, so let's see, how do we, how do we end this?
[01:16:17.300 --> 01:16:23.380]  Number one, tell people to take off their frigging mask, period. You don't need a mask anywhere,
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:26.900]  anywhere you go. The only place you need to wear a mask is on an airplane because you're
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:30.820]  an international airspace. You need a doctor's note at work. You also need a doctor's note,
[01:16:30.820 --> 01:16:35.140]  but you have no excuse to wear a mask anywhere else. They cannot find you. They cannot do
[01:16:35.140 --> 01:16:41.620]  anything to you. The mask law is a bylaw bylaws only apply to private corporations and government.
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:47.380]  So say I walk into a store. As soon as I claim my medical exemption, I'm now clear. The store
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:52.420]  is now clear. Nothing can happen to nobody legally. Say I was, I didn't want to claim my medical
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:55.940]  exemption. I was trying to cause trouble. And I just walked in there and say, I'm not wearing a
[01:16:55.940 --> 01:17:00.420]  mask. Call the police. I don't care. Say they call police and bylaw over there. And you're the one
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:06.500]  not wearing a mask. Guess what happens? The store gets fined. Not you, the store. Because a bylaw
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:10.500]  doesn't even apply to a private citizen. So why are you walking around in fear with a diaper on
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:15.300]  your face? Take it off. If everyone took off the mask. Well, by the way, all over the U S word,
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:19.780]  the governors have re have lifted the fake deal. The liberals keep doing it and are being more
[01:17:19.780 --> 01:17:24.980]  intense. They love it. Yes. They love the math because the mask is how they control people.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:29.940]  It's how they silence people. It's how you show your submission, your compliance. It's that simple.
[01:17:29.940 --> 01:17:33.620]  It literally is a muzzle. Try having a conversation with someone who has a mask.
[01:17:35.620 --> 01:17:39.380]  Yeah. They got a mask on and then they're standing behind a glass shield on top of that.
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:43.620]  And it's all this psyop that we're dirty and we're bad with all the studies show
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:48.260]  more human contact makes you healthier. That's the other thing they tell everything they're
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:52.340]  telling you to do to preserve your health, do the exact opposite. They're telling you,
[01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:56.020]  stay home, no, go out and get fresh air, get sunlight, get vitamin D. They're telling you,
[01:17:56.020 --> 01:18:01.540]  stay home and don't exercise. No, go to the gym. It's way better to exercise and be with people
[01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:06.740]  and socialize, bring up your metabolism, bring up your immune system, take vitamin D, take vitamin C,
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:13.220]  take magnesium, take zinc. They literally put out an official public health memo from
[01:18:13.220 --> 01:18:19.220]  Ontario public health that said you cannot boost your immunity with supplements or food.
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:23.940]  That's what they said. That's literally what an enemy would say to you if they wanted to destroy
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:28.500]  you. Yeah. Yeah. Don't take vitamin D. That's vital for your immune system. Vitamin C. That's
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:32.260]  vital for your immune system. Don't take any of that. Especially dark skinned people who
[01:18:32.260 --> 01:18:37.540]  live in Northern clines. They die without sun. They need it more than anybody. Every person who's
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:42.900]  non-white in Canada is vitamin D deficient for at least seven or eight months out of the year.
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:46.980]  Every single one of them. So if they're not taking vitamin D or they're not going to a tanning bed in
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:50.180]  the winter, they're going to have a lower immune system and they're going to be more likely to get
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:56.020]  sick with COVID. On Twitter and Facebook, they block that. I've done videos. Other people have
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:00.260]  done them saying, Hey, here's a study black folks need three times the sun. You know, the majority
[01:19:00.260 --> 01:19:04.420]  are, are, are vitamin D deficient. They shut it. They go, you're not, you're not the UN.
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:10.100]  You're not allowed to tell. It's sick. It's sick. It's disgusting. Everything they're doing is to
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:14.020]  control you. Everything they're doing is to make you sicker and weaker. So you won't fight back.
[01:19:14.020 --> 01:19:18.100]  So the only thing you do is the exact opposite. And the number one thing we need to do to get
[01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:23.380]  back to normal is besides rejecting the vaccine, which is easy and passive. This is the hard part.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:29.700]  We have to open the businesses. People, if our businesses do not open, the economy is ruined
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:34.260]  forever. There will be no recovery. There will be no, it will be like a depression,
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:39.140]  which they admit they want the universal social credit score and they want the universal basic
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:44.260]  income. This is the great reset. They admit it. Yeah. They want to take everything from you.
[01:19:44.260 --> 01:19:48.820]  They want to put you on a government paycheck where you literally will be leasing everything
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:52.900]  for the rest of your life. You'll not own a house. You won't own a car. You won't own anything,
[01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:56.820]  but you'll be happy. That's their tagline. They're literally telling you that they're
[01:19:56.820 --> 01:20:00.100]  going to take everything from you, but because they can, they're now saying in the London
[01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:05.220]  Guardian and New York times, we want yearly or bi-yearly carbon lockdowns to save the earth.
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:08.900]  And then they admit basically they staged this whole hoax. So that brings me next.
[01:20:08.900 --> 01:20:11.780]  How do we bring Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab and people to justice?
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:18.260]  Well, by first of all, rejecting the vaccine and then getting actual studies done on the
[01:20:18.260 --> 01:20:23.220]  vaccine to show how dangerous it really is and to prove in court that all of everything that
[01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:28.500]  they're doing is illegal. Every country around the world needs to launch a multi-platinum or
[01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:33.300]  class action lawsuit against their government. I restrict the liability protection. Plus that's
[01:20:33.300 --> 01:20:38.660]  just for liability. The vaccine's bad. They don't have protection from racketeering and fraud and
[01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:42.340]  suppression of information and buying off politicians. They've all committed crimes.
[01:20:42.340 --> 01:20:47.140]  We want Bill Gates and Klaus Schwab in prison now. They need to be charged with crimes against
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:51.700]  humanity. When it comes out that more and more people are being harmed by this vaccine,
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:55.700]  and it's going to be able to be proven that they knew this vaccine would cause this kind of
[01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:59.860]  problems because it never went through proper testing. They skipped animal trials because
[01:20:59.860 --> 01:21:03.300]  they knew it would probably kill most of the animals and they wouldn't even be able to start
[01:21:03.300 --> 01:21:08.420]  human trials. So everything they've done with this vaccine is completely illegal. And now people are
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:12.100]  dying and getting hurt from it. And now it's getting exposed that they're trying to use this
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:16.980]  vaccine to impose a medical tyranny control grid on the entire world. These are probably
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:23.060]  the largest crimes against humanity in recent, if not less than recent history. So they need to be
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:27.460]  held accountable in an international court and they need to be held accountable as quickly as
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:32.500]  possible before they can realize. And I totally agree with you. And boy did Bill Gates's news
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:36.500]  card go into overdrive when India a few months ago banned their Pfizer shot. They came out and
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:40.500]  said it wasn't true and that we were liars, even though it was actually in the Indian news. Now,
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:45.700]  20 some countries in Europe, a whole bunch of other ones have banned it. They're banning the
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:49.860]  AstraZeneca, the Pfizer, the Moderna. That's got to really scare the globalists. This isn't going
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:55.700]  well for them, is it? It isn't. And that's what we want. Every plan, their plan, we read it,
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:59.700]  you read the same UN document. We both read lockstep. We've both seen everything that
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:04.740]  the Rockefeller had been publishing. So the plans are very wonderfully written and they're very
[01:22:04.740 --> 01:22:09.140]  meticulously organized and they have all the funding they could possibly have. And they have
[01:22:09.140 --> 01:22:13.220]  all the manpower they could possibly have. But what will we know about every single plan ever
[01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:19.060]  created by man? It never goes according to plan. There's a thing called Murphy's law. Everything
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:24.340]  that can go wrong will go wrong. And I want to be Murphy. I want to make everything that can go
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:29.540]  wrong, go wrong for them. Cause all we need to do is keep waking people up and delaying their
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:34.900]  implementation. Cause it's like a tidal wave, a tidal wave of truth. That's going to just wash
[01:22:34.900 --> 01:22:39.300]  away all the bullshit that they've tried to impose on us over the last year, year and a half.
[01:22:39.300 --> 01:22:44.340]  As quickly as it came, it could leave instantaneously. It's that simple.
[01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:49.780]  And it's just about getting enough people. We can't just have it leave. We have to prosecute
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:54.660]  them. We have to prosecute, uh, governor Whitmer, governor Wolf, governor Cuomo,
[01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:59.620]  not for sexual harassment, but for the murdering people. And we have to prosecute Fauci. We have
[01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:03.940]  to absolutely never stop because they're just going to go into dormancy and then launch a new
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:09.460]  attack. Uh, later. So, uh, these guys, they gotta be, they gotta be made an example of in a way
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:15.540]  that even generations away from this five, six, seven generations later, they still don't want to
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:20.340]  try this again. We need to wake up humanity and actually, oh yeah, this is, I agree. This is the
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:24.820]  big globalist play. So as bad as it is, folks, this is their big play. This is him firing on
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:29.220]  all guns and it ain't going too well. All right. Uh, Chris sky, we love you. Give out the websites,
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:31.860]  give out the contact points and give out the hashtag one more time.
[01:23:32.660 --> 01:23:38.020]  Perfect. The main contact is Instagram at real Chris sky. I'm also Chris sky on Facebook and
[01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:44.260]  Chris sky on Twitter. Uh, the hashtag is very important. It's the hashtag just say no to the
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:49.940]  COVID vaccine campaign. And we want everybody to make a wall post with hashtag, just say no
[01:23:49.940 --> 01:23:55.460]  and hashtag just say no in the caption as well. Very important. And we want it on all the social
[01:23:55.460 --> 01:23:59.380]  medias. If you're on Instagram and you want me to follow you back, make it a story post tag me,
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:04.020]  I will follow you back. We got to share these videos everywhere. I'm seeing myself pop up on
[01:24:04.020 --> 01:24:07.460]  tick talk, all these places where I'm not even there. And that's what I like to see. I want to
[01:24:07.460 --> 01:24:11.460]  see, these are all videos that you're seeing scrolling from people making the just say no.
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:16.580]  And the reason we want hashtag just say no in the caption is when people search that hashtag,
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:21.460]  we want every single person that searched that hashtag to see nothing, but just say no to the
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:26.020]  COVID vaccine. Uh, images, what you're seeing here, every single one of those on screen is
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:31.140]  somebody that made a, just say no to the vaccine post. So now that hashtag has become synonymous
[01:24:31.140 --> 01:24:36.020]  with just say no to the COVID vaccine. And the next step is to start advertising in major American
[01:24:36.020 --> 01:24:40.900]  cities, Canadian cities as well, and get enough people on board with asking questions because
[01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:44.740]  all we need to do is get people to ask questions to their doctor, to their church leader,
[01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:48.340]  any of these people who are trying to influence them to take the vaccine. And when you ask the
[01:24:48.340 --> 01:24:52.580]  kind of questions, like what long-term safety data do you have? And the answer is none.
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:57.140]  Less people will be likely to take it. Well, that's right. Netanyahu's it's all the same
[01:24:57.140 --> 01:25:02.100]  script. Netanyahu's like approved by the FDA and America is safe. No, they waived all that. It's
[01:25:02.100 --> 01:25:07.700]  lies. And so again, the confidence act looks slick until you call them on it. What's up with
[01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:11.700]  Netanyahu and even Trump coming out and endorsing the vaccine. It's like, there's a gun to their
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:18.100]  head, man. It's very sad. It's very, very hard for people to go against the globalist agenda.
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:23.300]  And the agenda is everybody needs to be vaccinated. And that's the linchpin for
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:30.740]  their medical tyranny. There is no more invasive thing, taking away of your rights than being able
[01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:34.500]  to force a medical procedure. They're raping you. They're raping you. They're raping you. And I've
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:39.700]  never been raped by a person and I'm not going to be raped yet. Chris sky. We really appreciate
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:44.500]  you fighting this global rape against us by that psychotic Jeffrey Epstein controller,
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:48.500]  that little count Dracula, of course, bill Gates. Thank you so much. And we really look forward to
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:54.980]  speaking to you again, again, give people the URL or the hashtag one more time. Hashtag just say no
[01:25:54.980 --> 01:26:00.340]  at real Chris sky on Instagram guys. This is the most important fight humans have faced.
[01:26:00.340 --> 01:26:04.260]  So everyone's asking me, what can I do? What can I do? What can I do? This is what you can do,
[01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:07.940]  and it's going to make a huge difference. God bless you. We'll talk to you soon. Thanks for
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:17.300]  all the time, sir. Thank you. You don't need a mask. The mask is about compliance because they
[01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:21.460]  know Canadians like to do what they're told. So they tell you, you have to wear a mask. Next,
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:24.420]  they're going to tell you, you have to contact trace. Then they're going to tell you, you have
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:28.180]  to take the vaccine. And because Canadians like to do what they're told, they're hoping that
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:33.620]  everyone just complies. And then guess what kids, once you take your vaccine, like a dumb person
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:38.260]  that doesn't know any better, they're going to tell you, sorry, the vaccine isn't as effective
[01:26:38.260 --> 01:26:42.020]  as we thought it was going to be. So now you still got to wear your mask. Still got to get
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:46.980]  contact trace, still have all the restrictions and social distancing and still take your vaccine.
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:54.100]  So we saw you speaking earlier. What's the main message you're trying to get across today?
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:27:00.740]  The response to COVID is a lot worse than COVID and COVID isn't about a virus. It's about
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:05.940]  increasing government control over our lives by using fear tactics to make people comply
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:09.860]  with giving up the rights and freedoms that millions of people fought and died for.
[01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:14.580]  Cool. And what do you say to the people that we spoke to some of the people across the street,
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:19.380]  they're saying you guys are all stupid, that a lot of them say mandatory mask outside is what
[01:27:19.380 --> 01:27:22.900]  they want. How do you respond to people who are against what you're standing for here today?
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:27.380]  Well, the fact of the matter is I just came from Netherlands. The Dutch are not stupid people.
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:32.580]  They're smart, they're independent and they have balls. So guess what? They have no masks.
[01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:38.020]  They have 17 million people. If you go to a train station, maybe one out of 20 people is scared
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:43.540]  enough to wear a mask. Their bars are open. The girls are still working. You can go smoke a joint
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:47.380]  in their coffee shops. You can eat in their restaurant. They're open till two o'clock in
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:53.940]  the morning and they've had less than 200 people up to age 60 die. Also Amsterdam is one of the
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:58.980]  top three cities in all of Europe for international travel. 50 million visitors a year from all over
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:03.620]  the world. So I met people from all different countries when I was there. Guess what? The only
[01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:08.500]  other country that's stupid like Canada and wearing masks on their school children was Germany
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:14.980]  and Belgium. Belgium's EU and UN headquarters and Germany's had millions of people protesting in the
[01:28:14.980 --> 01:28:21.220]  streets over it. Italy, no masks on the kids. France, only masks for 12 and older. Egypt,
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:26.580]  no mask on the kids. Iran, no mask on the kids. Sweden, no mask on the kids. Finland, no mask.
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:33.300]  Denmark, no mask. So why do we need them here where all these other countries are just fine
[01:28:33.300 --> 01:28:38.660]  without them? Answer, you don't. And when you have real world examples, that's the proof.
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:43.300]  It's that simple. You don't need a mask. The mask is about compliance because they know Canadians
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:46.980]  like to do what they're told. So if they tell you you have to wear a mask, next they're going to
[01:28:46.980 --> 01:28:50.980]  tell you you have to contact trace. Then they're going to tell you you have to take the vaccine
[01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:54.740]  and because Canadians like to do what they're told, they're hoping that everyone just complies.
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:59.540]  And then guess what, kids? Once you take your vaccine, like a dumb person that doesn't know
[01:28:59.540 --> 01:29:04.260]  any better, they're going to tell you, sorry, the vaccine isn't as effective as we thought it was
[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:08.740]  going to be. So now you still got to wear your mask, still got to get contact trace, still have
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:13.060]  all the restrictions and social distancing and still take your vaccine. And then what did you
[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:17.700]  get out of all of this? You got a whole year where you weren't allowed to travel. Your business was
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:23.060]  closed. They took your rights and freedoms. They forced the vaccine on you. And what happened?
[01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:27.700]  The same amount of people died. Everything is the exact same. And now they're going to put you back
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:32.820]  on lockdown and bring it all the way till July of next year. So they can do the same thing again,
[01:29:32.820 --> 01:29:37.460]  bring you from July, August, and September, getting you off lockdown, but just to bring
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:42.820]  you back on lockdown again, if you idiots haven't figured it out yet, it's a perpetual cycle that
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:48.260]  you never get out of. And it's a way to take your rights, your freedoms, close your business, take
[01:29:48.260 --> 01:29:53.220]  your wealth. Why? So you become dependent on government. Why? If you're independent, the
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:57.700]  government works for you like it's supposed to. If you depend on the government to give you a paycheck
[01:29:57.700 --> 01:30:02.020]  to feed your family every month, because they closed your business on you, now the government
[01:30:02.020 --> 01:30:08.100]  doesn't work for you. The government rules you. So instead of a middle class, we have the government,
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:12.900]  upper class and the lower class dependents that rely on the government to survive.
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:17.380]  In other words, we have a slave class and that's what they're trying to do. It's that simple.
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:20.740]  All right. Thanks a lot, Chris. Why didn't the cops shut it down today?
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:24.740]  Cops didn't shut it down because they don't have the power to shut it down. I'm on quarantine. I
[01:30:24.740 --> 01:30:29.460]  was just in Ireland speaking to 15,000 people. They grabbed me before I could even get out of
[01:30:29.460 --> 01:30:33.780]  the car and said, you're not allowed to be here. Get out of here. I said, what are you going to do?
[01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:38.260]  Find me, arrest me, go for it. Do it right in front of everybody so I can challenge it,
[01:30:38.260 --> 01:30:41.780]  make it public, challenge it with all the different charter of rights and freedoms
[01:30:41.780 --> 01:30:46.420]  that you're breaking under these emergency laws that you do not have demonstrable justification
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:51.620]  to uphold. And then I will win. Everybody will know your laws are bullshit and this whole charade
[01:30:51.620 --> 01:30:57.300]  collapses. Newsflash. They found over 600 people breaking quarantine. You know how many got fines?
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:31:01.220]  Zero. It's not because they're cutting them a break. It's because they don't have the power
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:05.140]  to do it. Just like they don't have the power to shut down your business or give you a hundred
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:09.620]  thousand dollar fine. If you stay open, it's all lies. It's all smoke and mirrors, and none of it
[01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:13.940]  will hold up in court. And I'm proof they grabbed me. I'm here. I'm speaking to you. I was speaking
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:17.620]  on a, on the van. I'm not hiding from anyone. You want me to take you and go talk to the police
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:22.740]  right now? I will. And I want to explain something here that's critical to everything to understand.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:27.380]  They know that when they pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure, we finally organize and
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:32.100]  fight back. They'll take some of the pressure off knowing that we'll get unorganized and go away.
[01:31:32.100 --> 01:31:35.220]  So, but in Europe, in places where they're not getting organized, they just keep squeezing,
[01:31:35.220 --> 01:31:38.580]  squeezing, squeezing here. They're kind of, Oh, okay. And they're going to go right back.
[01:31:38.580 --> 01:31:43.060]  That's why this is the big issue. This is the big play. This is the war. This is the mark of the
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:48.820]  beast. This is their system. This is everything. And Chris sky is absolutely on target. We all
[01:31:48.820 --> 01:31:53.140]  need to be like Chris sky. We all need to be politically active and not make it like, Oh,
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:57.220]  I got to go protest or, Oh, I got to talk to folks at the grocery store. I walk in without
[01:31:57.220 --> 01:32:01.620]  a mask. They start talking to me. I start preaching. They go, okay, you're right. Just
[01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:08.340]  doing my job. I go, okay. And I just start talking and it's okay. You got to get past being scared to
[01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:13.300]  talk folks, or you can support shows like this and share the videos and the articles in full
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:18.580]  wars.com and news wars.com and share the hashtags. But I'm telling you, we need to get the introverts
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:24.900]  to become extroverts. The truth is I'm a very private person and I actually don't like grand
[01:32:24.900 --> 01:32:29.140]  standing and I don't like being public and I don't, you know, I'm not a particularly a very
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:34.900]  social person at a lot of levels. I'm a private person, but I have to do this. And every time I
[01:32:34.900 --> 01:32:39.700]  end up preaching to people at a gas station or at a store, I feel good about it later because it was
[01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:45.140]  the right thing to do. So let's listen. We've already gone two hours and the crew is up here.
[01:32:45.140 --> 01:32:49.300]  We've got to get this out by four o'clock. That's only an hour and 20 minutes away. Everybody's
[01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:54.980]  tuning in at four to see the special show. And I've got all this preparation on CRISPR and the
[01:32:54.980 --> 01:33:00.500]  gene editing and the mRNA and how they couldn't get approved. So they stampeded it through with
[01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:05.300]  this emergency. Now it's a total revolution of gene editing and the vaccines and people dying
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:10.100]  and the gene therapy. That's probably a hundred articles and documents right there. Just one of
[01:33:10.100 --> 01:33:14.900]  these is bombshell and I haven't even gotten to the bombshell stack. Guys, will you bring me the
[01:33:14.900 --> 01:33:19.940]  Crimson Contagion stack? I've only scratched the surface on that. And then I've got Biden
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:23.860]  flooding the borders and collapsing the country. The globalists are in trouble. They stole the
[01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:28.260]  world. They engage in massive fraud. They're a bunch of pedophiles and devil worshipers because
[01:33:30.100 --> 01:33:34.660]  that's just the way you get in their club is acting like that and committing crimes to prove
[01:33:34.660 --> 01:33:38.660]  you're a soulless bastard. You're like, why are they pedophiles and devil worshipers? That's just
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:44.660]  the initiation. MS-13 does devil worship and raping of kids because up until 20 years ago,
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:49.700]  nobody in Latin America would kill kids or hurt stuff. I mean, you know, like Tony Montana,
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:54.660]  famously, it's a fiction movie, but it's based on a composite of real people that Oliver Stone
[01:33:54.660 --> 01:34:01.060]  and others spent a decade writing. And he goes, no women, no kids. Nobody 30 years ago was killing
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:05.860]  women and kids hit men. I mean, you, you couldn't get American hit men to do it. You couldn't get
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:10.660]  Hispanic hit men to do it in Latin America. Now that it's par for the course, man, because it's
[01:34:10.660 --> 01:34:16.580]  evil. And if they can get you to kill old people and little kids, you'll do anything like we always
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:22.820]  all old people be nice to old people. Now it's like, kill all those old people. This is how you
[01:34:22.820 --> 01:34:26.740]  deal with somebody wants you to kill kids. Yeah. Go ahead and play this, play this whole thing.
[01:34:27.300 --> 01:34:31.300]  We don't have the audio cue that up and find it again. But first let's take a break here
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:36.100]  and let's play fentanyl, the dragon, the latest one I got this week, dealing with all the stuff
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:40.180]  that's going on. It's crazy. And then we'll come back with Scarface. And when he says you think
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:49.620]  I'm a worm like you, we'll be right back. Stay with us. The dragon, I am named after the product
[01:34:49.620 --> 01:34:57.460]  of my boss's CCP bring into your country. We will talk about it in a moment, but first the
[01:34:58.340 --> 01:35:05.780]  that I lost with your Bill Gates. And of course, Klaus Schwab on you a year old girl. And now you
[01:35:05.780 --> 01:35:11.700]  see what happens. You are in fear to leave your home. And Marvel's Marvin Hagler took shot and
[01:35:11.700 --> 01:35:19.620]  died. Just like your Hank Aaron. He said, take a shot to protect other people. But now it's
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:26.820]  admitted it does not protect you from COVID and Fauci good, Fauci good. He says you still can't
[01:35:26.820 --> 01:35:32.980]  go out and have the vaccine. You must social distance and stay close. And Canada say the same
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:48.580]  thing. You say it, UK, Australia, because I designed plan. That stands for stupid Americans.
[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:54.100]  You collapse while China stay open, make more billionaires and all will come by.
[01:35:54.100 --> 01:36:02.900]  We control your government. Nothing can stand against us. And your people take our shots and
[01:36:02.900 --> 01:36:15.860]  die. Die, Americans. Die. CCP will rule you. And now that Biden has been on Congress for two months,
[01:36:15.860 --> 01:36:23.940]  he banned your border patrol. So the deadly poison with one grain that can kill you is pouring in
[01:36:23.940 --> 01:36:33.220]  at 360% levels above Trump. Your tent cities are spreading too. And now your pregnant women
[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:40.580]  fly combat missions and will have sex change for your little boy. Now Friday this evening,
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:46.100]  it is important to agree with Brian Stelter that no one is allowed to have free speech like
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:52.660]  Dr. Carlson. He should be taken off the airwaves. And the Grammys, they do not need to wear a mask
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:58.580]  while they teach you to throw them all off cocktails at police. No. And you need to also
[01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:04.820]  understand that Swiss officials blame not taking vaccine for COVID, even though it admits that
[01:37:04.820 --> 01:37:12.260]  vaccines are causing mutations and spreading COVID. Good America, we can shut your mouth,
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:20.260]  take your shot and die. Cut your son's genitals off. Tell your little girl they're a boy.
[01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:27.860]  China will run you now. Roll over and die. Hello, hi. We run your people. We run you too.
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:33.460]  So do what we say and we're going to kill you too. I tell you again, I'll say it last time,
[01:37:33.460 --> 01:37:39.140]  info wars is not good. Bad info wars. Bad info wars. Good job, Biden.
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:45.060]  Oh, no, no, no. I don't even know what this is. How did this get here?
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:53.940]  I just caught you, American. You visited Bandar video. Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and others angry at
[01:37:53.940 --> 01:38:00.420]  you. Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar video. Oh, I have to hurt you.
[01:38:06.820 --> 01:38:12.180]  All right, folks, we are back. And this is a commercial free transmission. And some
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:17.860]  stations do carry it. But how PBS carries cuss words now and CNN doesn't. We're not supposed
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:21.860]  to because we're conservative. But but here is a clip with the cuss words and we're gonna leave it
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:29.620]  in there of Scarface back in the 1980s of the even the chivalry of criminals don't kill women
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:34.660]  and children. And that was all over the world until recently. And so this is the soullessness.
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:39.460]  Now we just kill all people. We keep babies alive, sell their organs. Now they're producing animal
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:44.260]  human clones. We better stand up for human life. We're gonna lose it all. Yeah, men that are
[01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:49.220]  involved in crime. They kill each other. Militaries kill each other. But we leave women and children
[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:54.100]  out of it. The idea of putting women in it is a sign of the fall of our society, the fall of our
[01:38:54.100 --> 01:39:09.140]  civilization. So here's a clip from one of the classic Scarface. What the fuck?
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:28.260]  What the fuck is that? Hey, come here. You told me she took the kiss on the other car.
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:31.780]  She did, boss. She did every fucking day. I don't know what's going on.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:38.100]  Hey, hey, no fucking way. Hey, no fucking way. That's it.
[01:39:51.780 --> 01:39:52.660]  Fucking guy.
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:40:05.380]  And this is a moment that America and the world's coming to. You let them kill kids.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:10.580]  Let them kill women and old people. Let Bill Gates do that and lose your soul.
[01:40:12.180 --> 01:40:13.860]  Are you gonna do that? Because they're coming after our kids.
[01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:19.540]  You gotta finally decide which side you're on. You decide who you serve.
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:23.540]  Okay.
[01:40:38.980 --> 01:40:43.540]  This is so fucking bad. This is so fucking bad.
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:48.900]  Okay, I see him, all right? I see him.
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:41:02.420]  Okay, shut the fuck up, okay?
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:14.100]  I'm gonna have the guts to look him in the eye when you kill him. You gotta hide with that
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:17.620]  fucking shit. Don't worry, man. He's getting out. Come on, let's do it.
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:22.820]  Make you feel good, huh? Make you feel good to kill a mother and her kids, huh? Make you feel
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:30.180]  big. You big man. Well, fuck you. Where do you think I am? You think I killed two kids and a
[01:41:30.180 --> 01:41:38.180]  woman? Fuck that. I don't need that shit in my life. You die, motherfucker.
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:46.980]  Where do you think I am, huh? What do you think, I'm a fucking worm like you?
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:54.100]  I told you, man. I told you, don't fuck with me. I told you, no fucking kids. No,
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:57.860]  but you wouldn't listen. Why, you stupid fuck. Look at you now.
[01:41:58.820 --> 01:42:03.700]  And that's my message to Bill Gates and all the rest of them. You guys are mentally ill. You're
[01:42:03.700 --> 01:42:08.580]  satanic. You come from filthy, evil, greedy families. Hell, you funded Hitler. You and
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:14.260]  your full filthy family. And I'm just not gonna put up with it. And I'm not threatening you. I'm
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:19.380]  just telling you, you're trying to attack us with your vaccines. You're attacking our children. And
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:23.540]  there is a God in the universe and people aren't gonna put up with it. And
[01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:30.900]  everybody has to ask themselves, you reject the left. They hurt children. You gotta reject them.
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:35.860]  And stop kissing their asses because that's what it comes down to.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:42.260]  This whole show is a message to Bill Gates and the New World Order and all of you that we see it.
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:46.660]  We know who you are. Your program to shut us up isn't working. Your program to threaten us
[01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:53.060]  isn't working. But you think you can threaten me? You think I care? I'm ready to die, buddy boy,
[01:42:53.140 --> 01:42:58.020]  because I'm not signing on to what you're doing to children. So if I know about what you're doing
[01:42:58.020 --> 01:43:03.460]  and I don't do anything, it makes me an accomplice, son. And I will not be an
[01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:09.860]  accomplice to this. And that's why I'm saying you need to stop. You need to stop where you're going.
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:14.980]  You need to stop pushing. You may have all the lawyers and yes men at the justice department
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:20.900]  kissing your ass, but you're this close to being where Jeffrey Epstein was, your guy compromising
[01:43:20.900 --> 01:43:24.820]  all scientists. And it's not going to be me that flushes you down the toilet. It's going to be the
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:28.180]  controllers that have put you out there as a front man because Gates, here's the deal. I know a lot
[01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:32.900]  of you psychos are kind of tone deaf. Do you realize how much you're hated? Do you realize
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:44.020]  what you're starting? You don't have any damn sense, Gates. None. You know, a lot of these
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:48.260]  old rich families are autistic. I don't mean that in a mean way. We call them space aliens.
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:52.820]  I know a lot of third generation trust fund people that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,
[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:56.740]  millions of dollars. And if they don't make their kids work and they don't stay, you know,
[01:43:56.740 --> 01:44:02.900]  connected to God, they turn into that. And all he wants to do is kill people.
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:08.100]  And hey Gates, we know what you're doing. You think you did it through the UN? You think you did it
[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:14.740]  all smart? There's no way we get this out at four o'clock. God, I've been taping so long it's almost
[01:44:14.740 --> 01:44:19.860]  four o'clock right now, tape to air. So we'll go live at five now because I swore I'd cover this
[01:44:19.860 --> 01:44:25.540]  and I got to edit. Then I got to give Gregory's time to put this together and add a few clips.
[01:44:26.100 --> 01:44:29.700]  But I'm still trying to finish up about 10 minutes here. So the rest of the crew can get
[01:44:29.700 --> 01:44:35.540]  home to their families. I appreciate them coming in. And again, there's a paradox where I don't
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:40.260]  hit a lot of this because it's so complex. It's also so smoking gun. Like you just can't do this
[01:44:40.260 --> 01:44:46.660]  justice. I mean, this is just, I mean, look what I got right here. This is just this. Look at all
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:59.540]  this. I mean, most of this is their words about how it's going to get rid of our immune system
[01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:05.220]  and kill a bunch of people and give us cancer. And then I cover it and you take it down off YouTube.
[01:45:05.380 --> 01:45:11.860]  And then what about the dumb asses at YouTube doing that? I mean, do you really want to be
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:17.140]  part of this? If you were riding along in that fictitious car, but a lot of real stuff like
[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:21.860]  that's happened and you're about to blow up to a four-year-old, a six-year-old girl with her dad.
[01:45:21.860 --> 01:45:25.060]  I mean, I guess you'd go ahead and just follow the orders, wouldn't you?
[01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:29.620]  Because you know what happens when she crossed that line?
[01:45:29.780 --> 01:45:32.660]  Tony Montana said, I don't need this in my life.
[01:45:35.060 --> 01:45:40.260]  So when he dies, he goes to heaven. When you die, you go to hell. See, cause there's a lot. What
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:45.940]  is hell? Hell is a separation from God. Where spirits don't die folks, you do evil crap. You
[01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:53.060]  resonate to that. You go there. That's it's real. You love God. You love justice. You just continue
[01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:59.620]  up through it's incredible. I've seen it. I've seen it folks. I'll leave it at that. I don't
[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:10.260]  need DMT to see it all. I guess God gave me that gift for that curse. I haven't really got into it
[01:46:10.260 --> 01:46:15.140]  on air yet, but my life, I have waking dreams. I have dreams that come true. And I also have
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:21.700]  dreams that are not of this world. And everybody has this talent. We just wall it all off. And the
[01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:29.860]  whole system is about keeping you from seeing it. Yeah. The ancients would describe it, not just in
[01:46:29.860 --> 01:46:35.700]  the Jewish texts or Christian texts, but other ones about like burning, like hell, destruction.
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:40.900]  The Greeks saw it and said it was just like horrible. It's like being burned.
[01:46:43.700 --> 01:46:49.620]  That's what separation from God's like. Because you're in a tomb of your own evil,
[01:46:49.700 --> 01:46:54.420]  cut off from all that's good with only evil. Can you imagine what that's like?
[01:46:56.260 --> 01:46:59.220]  No hope of ever getting out. No hope of ever getting away from it.
[01:47:03.460 --> 01:47:09.140]  But you have one thing you can do. And that's crawl up to the third dimension,
[01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:16.580]  like it, the clown looking through the sewer hatch or the drainage ditch to grab children.
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:20.180]  That's totally archetypal. Stephen King knows the stuff there.
[01:47:22.100 --> 01:47:26.420]  That's exactly how this works is they can just get right up to the edge of the
[01:47:27.140 --> 01:47:30.580]  third dimension and pop their little demon eyes up and go,
[01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:40.900]  who can I drag down with me? And that's it. I mean, can you imagine the easiest way to describe it?
[01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:46.500]  And it's hard to even compute it because we're so limited at this level. Can you imagine being
[01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:51.940]  second and first dimension? Like what was that like? It's worse than a prison cell folks. I mean,
[01:47:51.940 --> 01:47:56.260]  this is the third dimension, TV, movies, you know, our families, all this stuff's going on,
[01:47:56.260 --> 01:48:00.100]  but our souls are at a higher dimension, but we're here on the third dimension. Can you,
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:03.940]  it's like training wheel. We're not going on our hot wheels driving around here. This is like
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:10.180]  very simple stuff. Okay. But we're babies. Can you imagine the stuff beneath us?
[01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:15.540]  That's the easiest way to describe it. It's not really beneath us. It's just, it's a simpler
[01:48:15.620 --> 01:48:24.100]  thing. And all it can do is try to grab us and drag us down with it like a big giant squid.
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:29.380]  All right. Let me, let me just do this. I,
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:37.220]  there's really no way to still do all this justice.
[01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:41.060]  So
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:47.060]  we'll just have to hit it on the Sunday show because the crew's already done a great job
[01:48:49.300 --> 01:48:52.660]  and I can sit here and show you all this and go over all this. And I've already gone over a lot
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:59.620]  of it, but what does that even do? I mean, do you need me to tell you, Bill Gates is out to
[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:03.460]  get you my God, he's all over the damn television forever saying he wants to kill everybody. I mean,
[01:49:04.100 --> 01:49:06.980]  saying he wants to be popular about it. I mean, he doesn't even, he doesn't even,
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:09.860]  that's Bill Gates right there. I mean, Bill Gates looks scarier than that.
[01:49:10.500 --> 01:49:15.940]  I mean, that doesn't look as scary as Brian Stelter does.
[01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:22.180]  But if you're in a trance, you don't see what Brian Stelter looks like. I mean, Brian Stelter
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:30.820]  is a fricking predator, man. A horrible, nasty creature that doesn't even think about caring.
[01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:38.100]  And you look at these Super Bowl shows. I mean, it's all demonic because it's a weapon attacking
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:43.780]  our civilization. So if you're tuned into God, you look at this, you go, my God, this is the most
[01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:52.740]  satanic crap with a bunch of puppets bringing forth Lucifer and the Olympics with grim reapers
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:59.300]  killing all the kids. I mean, I mean, look at that guy. He thinks he's powerful. He thinks
[01:50:00.180 --> 01:50:03.060]  he's incredible. He thinks he's been given dominion over the earth.
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:06.180]  He's literally following a satanic program. He's on a power trip.
[01:50:08.500 --> 01:50:16.100]  No one watches him. Nobody likes him, but he's got the full backing of Bill Gates and ABC and
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:26.500]  AT&T and all the rest of it. They're all pretending. And they want us to wear masks
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:32.180]  and not have children and die so the earth can be theirs because they're so ugly spiritually.
[01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:37.540]  They don't want to look at us. They want us gone because they're so pathetic. Get that. They don't
[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:41.300]  want to make peace with you. They don't want to be your friend. They don't want to have a better
[01:50:41.300 --> 01:50:46.660]  future with you. They want you dead. They don't want to merge with you. They don't want to combine
[01:50:46.660 --> 01:50:54.900]  with you. They don't want to grow with you. They want you gone. Type in Brian Stelter and just put
[01:50:54.900 --> 01:50:59.780]  up his image for everybody. By the way, I'm told by a lot of really interesting people,
[01:50:59.780 --> 01:51:03.700]  I'll leave it at that, that these Brian Stelter times we have are very important to people.
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:08.020]  We should spend more time on him, but he's a good teaching tool. Type in Brian Stelter,
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:13.940]  click Google images, just show a pantheon of him, of this fallen, twisted, pathetic person.
[01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:18.340]  And I don't take pleasure in how pathetic he is, but look at the satanic satisfaction.
[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:23.460]  He's like a drooling idiot that took a bunch of fentanyl and thinks he's delusional.
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:31.460]  He's a sack of demonic garbage. Yeah. Look at that picture of Tucker Carlson, a regular guy
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:39.540]  next to him. Which one's human? Which one isn't? I mean, you can see it. If you're awake,
[01:51:40.420 --> 01:51:44.500]  if they've got you in a trance, you can't. Which one's fake? Like which, which, which,
[01:51:44.500 --> 01:51:49.220]  which orange is real? Which orange is plastic? If you had to choose a bowl of fruit,
[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:54.820]  one is real fruit. One is fake fruit. Which one is real? What is synthetic meat? What is real meat?
[01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:56.340]  What is oxygen? What is it?
[01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:04.740]  That's a sack of garbage, ladies and gentlemen. It's called Brian Stelter.
[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:12.820]  And it's got a fundamental problem with you. And as soon as you figure that out, you figure
[01:52:12.820 --> 01:52:17.700]  everything out. Cause just like Mike was saying the other day, we're not in their family. We're
[01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:23.540]  not in this globalist, satanic family. Gigi pings in the family. Ted Turner's in the family. You
[01:52:23.620 --> 01:52:28.180]  could be black, white, Asian. Doesn't matter. It's a family though. It's a look. It's a,
[01:52:28.180 --> 01:52:32.660]  it's a thing that they're avatars. They are something's wrong with them. They,
[01:52:32.660 --> 01:52:39.060]  they resonate with something that's bad. All right. I'm going to end this now.
[01:52:42.740 --> 01:52:44.900]  And I'm leaving town on a secret mission tomorrow.
[01:52:46.500 --> 01:52:49.380]  And I'll try to pop in on the shows and do some stuff, but I'm going to
[01:52:49.380 --> 01:52:54.420]  pull this together and cover it. As negative as things are the world's waking up countries
[01:52:54.420 --> 01:53:00.980]  are banned. The deadly vaccines everywhere. Biden's a complete joke. All the people that
[01:53:00.980 --> 01:53:05.300]  went along with it know they've been duped. And this is all just a great process of awakening.
[01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:09.060]  So I'm gonna leave it at that. And I just want to thank the crew for coming in on Saturday
[01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:14.020]  to take the last two plus hours. And I just want to thank you all for spreading the word
[01:53:14.020 --> 01:53:17.860]  about this show once we're airing it, because that's really how it gets legs and has an effect.
[01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:22.180]  You know, I'm not risking my life for no reason. I know we're going to win in the end,
[01:53:22.180 --> 01:53:25.300]  but that was my body. It doesn't really matter at the other day. It's the spirit.
[01:53:25.300 --> 01:53:28.660]  And I think you should all get in that same mode yourselves. Then we're going to have a
[01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:32.900]  future together. And that's what this is all about. If we don't take everybody with us,
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:36.900]  we have no future. God is not going to put up with that. No one is going to be thrown overboard,
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:43.940]  but people that aren't with us and people that want us to be thrown overboard. Well,
[01:53:44.660 --> 01:53:48.660]  we need to find an Island to maroon their ass on. Oh, God already figured that out.
[01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:54.900]  See, just go away from us. That's all you're not. We'll never have to look at them or talk to them
[01:53:54.900 --> 01:54:00.820]  again forever. Like you like to save pictures from 20 years ago. You know about pack rats.
[01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:06.340]  God's a pack rat music. We're on this planet for no reason. We just appeared here and now
[01:54:06.340 --> 01:54:11.220]  all there's no consciousness. There's no nothing going on. Oh, oh, you're an animal. You don't
[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:17.220]  have free will. Oh, your dog doesn't really love you. You're anthropomorphizing that. That's BS,
[01:54:17.220 --> 01:54:20.420]  man, because they want you depressed, believing your dog doesn't love you.
[01:54:20.420 --> 01:54:23.620]  These are demons. Your dog loves you. Your cat loves you.
[01:54:27.780 --> 01:54:33.220]  They want you alone. They're liars. So don't be depressed and don't be upset and be strong.
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:36.260]  And I'm telling myself that back because I get really upset. Folks get very upset
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:43.220]  because I want to be able to have enough will to be like Atlas and pick the world up. I'm not Atlas.
[01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:50.180]  I'm not God. All God wants us to do is make the right decision and free will. God will do the
[01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:58.260]  rest separately. I should probably plug. We won't be here. The big mega sale, the last sale for free
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:04.420]  shipping at the end. But we have store wide free shipping on select items. We have select items,
[01:55:04.420 --> 01:55:08.980]  free shipping, Brainforce Plus, Prostaguard, Vaseline Beats Alpha Power, Dr. Jones,
[01:55:08.980 --> 01:55:14.340]  Natural's Charcoal activated toothpaste and the mouthwash and all the Emmerich's Essentials are
[01:55:14.340 --> 01:55:19.460]  great deals. They're really high quality products and it funds operation free shipping on those.
[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:24.020]  And of course, 50 percent off info or store dot com. And they're great products. But whatever
[01:55:24.020 --> 01:55:30.260]  you do, get a F Biden shirt or an F Fauci shirt or an F mass shirt. That's really a great way.
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:34.020]  I should wear my own shirt at the grocery store. And actually, I do wear them occasionally. I
[01:55:34.180 --> 01:55:37.700]  haven't gone out and had confrontations yet with it. It's all an info or store dot com.
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:44.100]  So that's it for this transmission. Like I said, 4 p.m. tomorrow will be the live Sunday show.
[01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:48.020]  Owen's going to be hosting it because I'm going to be at an undisclosed location working on some
[01:55:48.020 --> 01:55:52.180]  things and a lot of exciting stuff going on. I just want to thank the crew again for coming in
[01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:59.540]  here. And as Porky Pig says, that's all, folks. We believe in peace. But we are bringing you
[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:04.500]  a floor of information and a human agenda to shut our speech down and attack us.
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:15.860]  We will defend ourselves. Satellite phones used to be super expensive and the price has gone down
[01:56:15.860 --> 01:56:19.380]  quite a bit. But this is one of the best deals out there. And then we make a small percentage
[01:56:19.380 --> 01:56:23.620]  off every deal you sign up for. So you get the phone for free, a high end phone. I looked it up
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:28.580]  for the best out there. And then it's a year contract. And then you have the minutes already
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:31.940]  on the phone. And if you want to get more minutes, you can do that. But it's a good deal.
[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:36.500]  And it's the best deal. It's apples and oranges, but it's right up there as the best deals
[01:56:36.500 --> 01:56:41.140]  in followers phone dot com. And I didn't know that satellite phones had gone down to this price.
[01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:45.700]  I've got one right here. Again, these are among some of the best out there. A free phone sign up
[01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:50.260]  for a year like nine dollars a month. You get all these minutes on a sat phone. They can't track
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:54.500]  you. They can't trace you. This is next level. And so I've got one. I'm booting it up. It's
[01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:58.660]  got the controller. It's got the antennas. It's got everything. So, Steve, thanks for
[01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:02.180]  recommending this. And tell us about the sat phone and why it's important. Well, first of all, Alex,
[01:57:02.180 --> 01:57:08.100]  the critical communication with our loved ones, with information sources. That's what this is
[01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:14.420]  all about. The sat phones, media censorship is happening. You and I both know that corporations
[01:57:14.420 --> 01:57:20.500]  can't be trusted. Cellular phones are subject to hacking and tracking. And I said they're
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:26.100]  big move. They're going to shut off individually. Patriot phones. Absolutely. And I came up with a
[01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:32.660]  statement. I stand by it. They want to track you, whack you and stack it. Stack is like dead bodies.
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:39.380]  Listen, I'm passionate about this. I have to know that my loved ones are alive. I have to know that,
[01:57:39.380 --> 01:57:44.260]  hey, if I need to call Alex, if there's an operation going, you and I and others who are
[01:57:44.260 --> 01:57:50.420]  talk radio will be shut down selectively at the cell phone level. Well, that's actually my plan
[01:57:50.420 --> 01:57:54.580]  to set it up with other people that can actually get messages, record it from the phone if I'm in
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:57:57.700]  the field and it still gets out. I mean, we're having we're having to actually look at this,
[01:57:57.700 --> 01:58:01.220]  folks, because that's the end game we're moving into. We're like, as a collapse of censorship
[01:58:01.220 --> 01:58:05.860]  happens, it goes exponential now. Look, the world's in a crisis. Let's face it. And I want
[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:11.300]  to stay in contact with all my supporters, all my people that have subscribed to my newsletter. But
[01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:15.300]  this is what we're also setting up from satellite. It'll go to ham radio operators.
[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:18.580]  All the hands have already been talking to me, not all of them, but a lot of them.
[01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:23.460]  And the point is, is this like you said, this is the best deal, by the way, 150 minutes,
[01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:27.940]  and they allow you to roll your minutes. So if you don't use 150 minutes in February,
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:32.980]  you can use it March or March now and April. I have one. I sent my wife one of these that saved
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:39.380]  her sister's life because they were in a really bad situation floating a river. She got a phone
[01:58:39.380 --> 01:58:44.740]  call out to me on her sat phone. And I basically had airplanes in the air. This is the way to not
[01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:48.740]  just put the regular phones inside privacy pockets. This is the way to go. And I looked
[01:58:48.740 --> 01:58:51.300]  it up. You're like, okay, you're saying I should go with these people. You're not making money on
[01:58:51.300 --> 01:58:55.940]  that. I check like this is one of the best deals. If the other best deals are $600 for a phone,
[01:58:55.940 --> 01:59:01.540]  then you still pay for the minutes on a card. This is free phone sign up for a year, $99 a month.
[01:59:01.540 --> 01:59:05.620]  It's a great deal. And then you have these minutes you can roll over and get in the habit folks of
[01:59:05.620 --> 01:59:09.380]  using a sat phone and explain. You can call people on regular phones with a sat phone.
[01:59:09.380 --> 01:59:14.740]  Absolutely. And the neat thing is, is anybody who calls you on a sat phone, if they initiate the
[01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:18.980]  call, you're not paying for it. That's what I want people to understand. I'm telling you folks,
[01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:23.140]  this is an insane deal. I remember hearing Steve 10 years ago talking about satellite phones,
[01:59:23.140 --> 01:59:26.580]  and I just, I didn't ignore it. I respect him. I was like, okay, whatever. But I was like,
[01:59:26.580 --> 01:59:30.580]  how do I get the best preparedness products? I know he's a big famous, one of the first big
[01:59:30.580 --> 01:59:34.180]  survivalist. He said, sat phones, Alex sat phones. I'll give you the lady. And then we checked it.
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:37.380]  It's one of the best deals out there. And then this supports the broadcast. Not, not much. It's
[01:59:37.380 --> 01:59:41.220]  a little bit of money, but I don't care folks. I've got one. We're starting to use it. It's
[01:59:41.220 --> 01:59:45.060]  incredible. It's so clear. And it's crazy that this is a phone that's not watching you. This
[01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:49.220]  is a phone, not listening to you, not sending cookies out, not controlling you. This is really
[01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:56.580]  a free phone. It's it's by free. I mean, it's actually in the ether. It's real.
