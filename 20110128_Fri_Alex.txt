[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:34.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.280 --> 00:40.680]  here we are my friends one of the last live shows the first month of 2011 got a
[00:40.680 --> 00:46.360]  jam-packed transmission lined up for you obviously the protest exploding all
[00:46.360 --> 00:51.800]  over the Middle East and North Africa are intensifying all over Egypt the
[00:51.800 --> 00:59.280]  New York Times is now reporting that in Alexandria and also in Cairo the police
[00:59.280 --> 01:04.560]  are stopping their clashes with the citizens and shaking hands with them
[01:04.560 --> 01:10.640]  and sharing bottled water that's what happened in 89 with Chalcescu in
[01:10.640 --> 01:18.040]  Romania and so more and more it looks like Egypt is going to fall to the
[01:18.040 --> 01:22.960]  population they the Egyptian government is arresting basically the entire
[01:22.960 --> 01:28.920]  leadership of the Muslim Brotherhood Hosni Mubarak is a dictator Joe Biden is
[01:28.920 --> 01:33.480]  running around sticking his finger and everybody's face saying don't call him a
[01:33.480 --> 01:38.240]  dictator just like we heard last week don't call who Jin Tao a dictator they
[01:38.240 --> 01:42.360]  are dictators and even the Sydney Morning Herald gets it right when they
[01:42.360 --> 01:47.120]  says the US sticks to its old playbook of trying to prop up dictators now I've
[01:47.120 --> 01:53.680]  seen some people saying that the West and last week you know we looked at that
[01:53.680 --> 01:58.080]  with some guests on air that the West is somehow financing that there is no
[01:58.080 --> 02:06.640]  evidence of this Tunisia Yemen and Egypt are all Western puppet states with
[02:06.640 --> 02:13.360]  dictatorships basically over them and the population you know in a way the
[02:13.360 --> 02:18.240]  globalist are causing this because in the last year as the dollars been
[02:18.240 --> 02:25.000]  devalued causing world commodity prices in fuel and mainly food to go up you've
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.400]  got 50 plus percent of the Egyptian population making two dollars a day or
[02:30.400 --> 02:35.600]  less about half the population is on some form of food stamps just like 43
[02:35.600 --> 02:39.320]  million Americans are on food stamps they're on the equivalent of food stamps
[02:39.320 --> 02:43.400]  they go to these government facilities and are given food and they're starving
[02:43.400 --> 02:48.480]  I mean you look at these rioters they've are very skinny I mean they've they look
[02:48.480 --> 02:53.320]  malnourished there you know their cheeks are sucked in and boy a hungry stomach
[02:53.320 --> 02:57.040]  makes an angry person people are so depressed over not being able to feed
[02:57.040 --> 03:00.640]  their children they're setting themselves on fire as you know in the last three
[03:00.640 --> 03:06.640]  days that's desperation right there just like we had the Romanian parliament
[03:06.640 --> 03:11.480]  one of the TV producers there for government TV throwing himself off the
[03:11.480 --> 03:15.080]  balcony and almost killing himself saying you've sold our country out you've
[03:15.080 --> 03:18.640]  sold our children out he jumped off a three-story balcony head first trying to
[03:18.640 --> 03:23.280]  kill himself this isn't just something that Muslims do or Buddhists do humans
[03:23.280 --> 03:29.120]  do this when they get desperate and it's the IMF the World Bank are saying cut
[03:29.120 --> 03:34.080]  all of your budgets everything must go to us on interest on your debt and these
[03:34.080 --> 03:38.880]  countries some of them are paying over 20% interest on made-up fiat currency owed
[03:38.880 --> 03:43.520]  to the bankers because the bankers sold them on investing in derivatives this
[03:43.520 --> 03:49.720]  all started 12 years ago in 1999 and it's gonna suck down Greece it's gonna
[03:49.720 --> 03:57.520]  suck down Ireland it's gonna suck down Spain and Portugal and England and the
[03:57.520 --> 04:01.760]  United States in fact the Economist magazine is out today saying that yes
[04:01.760 --> 04:09.200]  the United States is actually in worse shape than Greece is with its finances
[04:09.200 --> 04:13.920]  and that's true and the issue here is I'm all for cutting government spending
[04:13.920 --> 04:17.320]  because that's what gets us dependent so the bankers can hold us hostage and say
[04:17.320 --> 04:22.000]  pay higher taxes do what we say or we'll cut off the basic you know food
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.720]  stamps and things that people are now dependent on but once you're already in
[04:25.720 --> 04:31.080]  the situation and once you're dealing with a thousand five hundred trillion
[04:31.080 --> 04:35.160]  and Davos the bankers demanding another hundred trillion they can leverage out
[04:35.160 --> 04:40.640]  to a quadrillion one thousand trillion you could cut everything you could pay
[04:40.640 --> 04:44.640]  a hundred percent taxes you could never pay all this back it's not owed it's
[04:44.640 --> 04:49.120]  made up and that's the big secret I hear all these conservatives on radio so we
[04:49.120 --> 04:53.160]  got to cut this we got to cut that that'll do nothing let me explain that
[04:53.160 --> 04:59.360]  again zero zero you've got to default on all this debt we'll be right back
[04:59.360 --> 05:03.640]  hi folks this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you

[06:02.440 --> 06:07.160]  that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than
[06:07.160 --> 06:11.080]  50 years he says it will change everything about our lives the way you

[06:26.720 --> 06:31.560]  growth properties in fact Barron's called his work a dire prophecy recently

[06:35.200 --> 06:39.200]  and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener I can't stress

[07:06.520 --> 07:11.040]  Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[07:11.040 --> 07:14.440]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be
[07:14.440 --> 07:18.360]  getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their

[08:12.120 --> 08:19.640]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.640 --> 08:26.440]  Alex Jones okay my friends very important transmission today obviously
[08:26.440 --> 08:29.920]  with what's happening all over the world I'm an attempt to cover all of this
[08:29.920 --> 08:37.640]  news that's in front of me it of course is the 28th day of January 2011 I want
[08:37.640 --> 08:41.200]  to talk about the V for victory operation we launched seven days ago last
[08:41.200 --> 08:45.840]  Friday it has been the most wildly successful grassroots program we've
[08:45.840 --> 08:50.640]  ever launched it is just off the charts the huge response we're seeing I want to
[08:50.640 --> 08:54.480]  spend some time on that today and we've been sent scores of new videos and
[08:54.480 --> 08:59.920]  flyers and activist material we're gonna be posting up on info wars dot com and
[08:59.920 --> 09:04.160]  present planet dot com today obviously a few days ago I had Brad Meltzer of
[09:04.160 --> 09:09.240]  decoded the best-selling author on and Mark Dyche did not like what they did
[09:09.240 --> 09:14.560]  with the episode that he was in and I do see a lot of big globalist connections
[09:14.560 --> 09:19.080]  Meltzer said that I would be pleased with the show and that he actually
[09:19.080 --> 09:24.200]  agreed with me at the end of the show I have to say it was a whitewash overall
[09:24.200 --> 09:28.640]  and that it was a mixed bag of where they would show both sides they would show
[09:28.640 --> 09:32.920]  what I had to say and all the activists in it said that you know they're setting
[09:32.920 --> 09:37.480]  up global government corruption that it's dangerous what's happening but then
[09:37.480 --> 09:40.600]  they made fun of me and said that I was basically wrong about a skull and bones
[09:40.600 --> 09:44.960]  connection with no proof and then the host of the show at the end say oh we
[09:44.960 --> 09:49.080]  don't think it's a bad thing gee we wish we could be members and basically act
[09:49.080 --> 09:52.880]  like they want to be groupies especially the woman host then they cut to Meltzer
[09:52.880 --> 09:56.440]  at the end he says well I disagree with my host I think overall it's probably
[09:56.440 --> 10:01.360]  bad but it's still a good club but I'm surprised this made it on national TV
[10:01.360 --> 10:05.360]  but it shows how the internet and alternative media has pushed these
[10:05.360 --> 10:10.160]  issues out there where the establishment 11 years after I snuck in can't cover
[10:10.160 --> 10:14.240]  it up anymore but I'm gonna get Meltzer back on next week he said he'd come on
[10:14.240 --> 10:18.600]  and we'll really go over this I'll have time to get some clips from the show we
[10:18.600 --> 10:23.520]  forgot to record it up here last night I did record it at home but we've got to
[10:23.520 --> 10:26.800]  get that transferred over I want to play a few of these clips coming up next week
[10:26.800 --> 10:33.040]  separately obviously we're gonna be getting into the economy Egypt on the
[10:33.040 --> 10:38.720]  verge of the government being overthrown we've got Wayne Madsen joining us in
[10:38.720 --> 10:42.880]  22 minutes from now to give us his take Larry Pratt joins us in the middle of
[10:42.880 --> 10:47.440]  the next hour of the head of gun owners of America to talk about Obama
[10:47.440 --> 10:51.040]  throwing down the gauntlet yesterday and saying yes within two weeks he's gonna
[10:51.040 --> 10:58.600]  call for and try to get introduced a raft of draconian victim disarmament and
[10:58.600 --> 11:03.360]  we've got our Friday visit he wasn't with us last Friday but we've got our
[11:03.360 --> 11:06.600]  Friday visit coming up with Bob Chapman in the last 30 minutes we're gonna get
[11:06.600 --> 11:11.280]  Lindsay Williams to pop in with some new developments on that front so a jam
[11:11.280 --> 11:17.280]  packed broadcast obviously today one other little issue that I'm gonna be
[11:17.280 --> 11:23.080]  playing next week I got contacted a few weeks ago by the management company for
[11:23.080 --> 11:33.160]  Aerosmith and I was told that the legendary guitarist Joe Perry had
[11:33.160 --> 11:39.280]  dedicated his new solo album to yours truly have guitar will travels name of
[11:39.280 --> 11:43.840]  the album downloaded it yesterday they're mailing me a copy excellent music
[11:43.840 --> 11:53.320]  obviously but talked to Joe for about an hour yesterday and he wants us to and
[11:53.320 --> 11:56.920]  I'm honored to play some of it on the show and it deals with the new world
[11:56.920 --> 12:01.400]  order and obviously what's in the water and the whole global is to program
[12:01.400 --> 12:07.120]  police state especially two tracks on the new album so very exciting to have
[12:07.120 --> 12:12.920]  folks reach out from Aerosmith almost on a weekly basis I get contacted by big
[12:12.920 --> 12:20.320]  Hollywood stars huge musicians and 99% of the time I'd say 98% of the time they
[12:20.320 --> 12:23.000]  don't want to come on air they just privately want to say we appreciate what
[12:23.000 --> 12:27.240]  you're doing and the reason that's important is it shows the reach of this
[12:27.240 --> 12:32.920]  broadcast and that celebrities across the board are are getting out of the
[12:32.920 --> 12:36.800]  left-right paradigm and really waking up to the real nature of the world that
[12:36.800 --> 12:41.760]  shows where popular culture is going as another big win for Liberty but who knows
[12:41.760 --> 12:47.040]  in the future you may hear Joe Perry and others here on the broadcast I don't
[12:47.040 --> 12:52.960]  really push for folks to come on the show but certainly very well-spoken guy
[12:52.960 --> 12:56.640]  talked to him for more than an hour yesterday and his wife is also great and
[12:56.640 --> 13:04.880]  very informed extremely informed about what's going on in the world today in
[13:04.880 --> 13:08.720]  fact he said to me he said you know living in the world today we're living
[13:08.720 --> 13:12.800]  on the edge we need to get that for for bumper music because I in fact years
[13:12.800 --> 13:15.720]  ago I heard that song we've all heard it many times and thought ought to use that
[13:15.720 --> 13:19.560]  as bumper music and never never got around to it so let's get living on the
[13:19.560 --> 13:25.480]  edge and maybe maybe play a bit of that from Aerosmith today here on the
[13:25.480 --> 13:29.000]  broadcast but next week we're gonna be playing some of Joe Perry's solo music
[13:29.000 --> 13:34.280]  and right there in the insert I was on iTunes looking at it's dedicated to Alex
[13:34.280 --> 13:38.520]  Jones and the sea shepherds who certainly do do a good job trying to
[13:38.520 --> 13:42.080]  expose them killing of whales that's a big area I don't like killing elephants
[13:42.080 --> 13:47.120]  and whales and things like that they almost extincted whales in the last
[13:47.120 --> 13:54.120]  century but very very honored that that is going on okay let me just obviously
[13:54.120 --> 13:58.880]  I'm gonna get into what's happening in the Middle East and North Africa first
[13:58.880 --> 14:12.600]  here but then I want to get into this report in your face dealing with Atlanta
[14:12.600 --> 14:18.720]  Police Department unit investigated over public strip search WSB TV and the
[14:18.720 --> 14:22.240]  police chief admits this went on but then buried in there the headline shouldn't
[14:22.240 --> 14:27.440]  be public broad daylight strip search at a drug checkpoint a Nazi checkpoint a
[14:27.440 --> 14:33.720]  Soviet style checkpoint an authoritarian checkpoint but they actually did a
[14:33.720 --> 14:38.960]  cavity search on the man they actually put their hand inside of it I mean you
[14:38.960 --> 14:44.320]  cannot make this type stuff up and TSA has said in the future they may need to
[14:44.320 --> 14:50.200]  do cavity searches so you know first it's put their hands on your genitals
[14:50.200 --> 14:53.680]  through your pants and it's in your pants it starts with take your shoes off
[14:53.680 --> 14:57.680]  take your belt off and it just gets worse and worse so we're gonna be getting
[14:57.680 --> 15:01.520]  in to that but buried in the article there's the cavity search in broad
[15:01.520 --> 15:05.600]  daylight and of course the feds are already paying nationwide grants to have
[15:05.600 --> 15:11.040]  police set up warrantless checkpoints and take blood without warrants they want
[15:11.040 --> 15:17.160]  in our personal space they're training police under the model states health
[15:17.160 --> 15:22.400]  emergency powers act for now nine years to forcibly inject us with vaccines DC
[15:22.400 --> 15:25.880]  announced they'll give you a discount on your driver's license if you give them
[15:25.880 --> 15:30.840]  a blood test Clinton signed that executive order it's it's part of
[15:30.840 --> 15:35.880]  executive fiat law they never implemented it but he signed it in 94 it's in my
[15:35.880 --> 15:39.560]  first film made in 97 I show the executive order I take it to the state
[15:39.560 --> 15:42.960]  police and read it to them and they promptly arrest me and I said look here's
[15:42.960 --> 15:46.440]  the executive order that they're gonna put clinics in here and take blood they
[15:46.440 --> 15:50.720]  of course were laughing about it but but this is what they've been planning this
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.480]  is the holy grail and so now the police are gonna pull you over and take your
[15:55.480 --> 16:01.080]  pants off on the side of the road in broad daylight in Atlanta and I mean I'm
[16:01.080 --> 16:07.960]  sorry I would resist that I would resist somebody knocked me on the head when I
[16:07.960 --> 16:11.680]  was jogging and I woke up they were trying to rape me I'd resist and if cops
[16:11.680 --> 16:14.840]  are pulling you over and trying to shove their hand in you I mean well what are
[16:14.840 --> 16:20.680]  you supposed to do to these crazy people who think they're God now we told you
[16:20.680 --> 16:26.040]  that this was gonna happen and the reports are now pouring in and of course
[16:26.040 --> 16:31.920]  this is the top story up on the drudge report today in the last two weeks we
[16:31.920 --> 16:36.240]  actually wrote multiple articles and info wars dot com Paul Watson and Jason
[16:36.240 --> 16:43.280]  Douglas did with the headlines homeland security hysteria showing how every day
[16:43.280 --> 16:46.960]  we'd see as many as six seven eight cases of where they shut down whole
[16:46.960 --> 16:51.280]  highways because of a cardboard box where they'd shut down whole factories
[16:51.280 --> 16:55.240]  because somebody saw somebody on a cell phone and they're putting out these TSA
[16:55.240 --> 16:59.880]  videos on TV and the web showing people in a mall going look he's on a phone he
[16:59.880 --> 17:05.200]  looks suspicious look he paid for cash he paid with cash call the police where
[17:05.200 --> 17:09.320]  they're just taking normal activity and saying it's a sign of terrorism to create
[17:09.320 --> 17:13.520]  this perception that it's so deadly real and then it's so dangerous when you got
[17:13.520 --> 17:17.360]  a better chance of running into a deer and flipping your car and dying hundreds
[17:17.360 --> 17:20.480]  and hundreds die a year from that then you do a terrorism you got a better
[17:20.480 --> 17:23.760]  chance of dying from peanut allergy a better chance of dying from a bolt of
[17:23.760 --> 17:27.240]  lightning I mean you can pull these statistics up we've written articles with
[17:27.240 --> 17:30.720]  the government's own statistics showing the hundreds and hundreds of things that
[17:30.720 --> 17:34.440]  you have a better chance of dying from of course the number one thing is
[17:34.440 --> 17:38.400]  obviously automobile accidents 300 plus thou a year I mean the world's a
[17:38.400 --> 17:44.360]  dangerous place it's like this woman two days ago that got a $48,000 settlement
[17:44.360 --> 17:50.080]  with Travis County where I reside here in Austin Texas that's the county that
[17:50.080 --> 17:54.240]  Austin's in because she was riding in a rural area with a group of long distance
[17:54.240 --> 18:01.600]  bikers on the shoulder in a rural one lane road and hit a pothole on the
[18:01.600 --> 18:07.680]  shoulder and is suing and the county just gave her money I mean it's this
[18:07.680 --> 18:12.560]  idea that the government must keep us safe Isaac Asimov back in the 40s wrote
[18:12.560 --> 18:18.320]  the seminal book I robot where the government develops robots whose main
[18:18.320 --> 18:22.080]  job is to keep us safe but the name of keeping us safe they build a total
[18:22.080 --> 18:25.760]  tyranny we're not even allowed to leave your house and you're basically just
[18:25.760 --> 18:29.120]  plugged into the wall because that's the only way the robots can make sure you're
[18:29.120 --> 18:35.240]  safe and getting into a sociological situation you go back 3,000 years ago to
[18:35.240 --> 18:38.800]  the different dynasties in China this first started about 3,000 years ago
[18:38.800 --> 18:43.040]  of course they've had dynasties for 5,000 that the priest class would learn
[18:43.040 --> 18:47.080]  how to manipulate the royal family and say women must have tiny feet let us
[18:47.080 --> 18:50.240]  bind your feet so they couldn't walk women aren't allowed to cut their
[18:50.240 --> 18:55.160]  fingernails kings aren't allowed to leave the sacred city to where they were
[18:55.160 --> 19:01.880]  just paralyzed and conned by the servant class of the elite and then the
[19:01.880 --> 19:05.960]  servant class became the elite and that's what's happening here with this
[19:05.960 --> 19:10.000]  nanny state and the globalists know exactly what they're doing I've got to
[19:10.000 --> 19:15.000]  pay as a taxpayer into that $48,000 for this woman who was riding her bike hit
[19:15.000 --> 19:20.720]  a pothole on the shoulder I mean it's a country road there's not there's not
[19:20.720 --> 19:24.840]  unlimited money here no one's perfect I mean you've got to know if you go on
[19:24.840 --> 19:28.840]  long-distance bike trips and you get tired I remember one time back when I
[19:28.840 --> 19:32.880]  was in better shape like 16 years ago in a long-distance bike track for me
[19:32.880 --> 19:36.320]  long distance like 20 miles and I wasn't paying attention had my head down
[19:36.320 --> 19:39.960]  going up a hill and ran into a pothole and it flipped and I got hurt she broke
[19:39.960 --> 19:44.520]  her jaw I just skinned my elbows did I go sue everybody because I was going up
[19:44.520 --> 19:47.800]  a hill not paying attention you know just looking down at the ground and hit
[19:47.800 --> 19:53.280]  it and flipped I mean do you owe me money because of that the government
[19:53.280 --> 19:57.800]  can't and won't protect you all they can do is take your rights I got even

[25:37.640 --> 25:42.600]  parking lot and a guy's arguing somebody on a cell phone I just saw an
[25:42.600 --> 25:45.520]  article last week where a guy was watering his lawn and the people thought
[25:45.520 --> 25:50.040]  the end of the hose was a gun they killed him and the police said well good
[25:50.040 --> 25:54.640]  job you know we better safe than sorry I saw an article where they busted in the

[26:02.400 --> 26:07.200]  begin with to create the crisis and offer the solution of tyranny they keep
[26:07.200 --> 26:11.840]  the drugs illegal to keep the price up so their bosses can make more money but
[26:11.840 --> 26:16.560]  now at Walmart I've got other reports of this today as well report of our man
[26:16.560 --> 26:25.320]  leads to lock down at Walmart 44% of US retail sales 42 worldwide is Walmart

[26:28.720 --> 26:33.760]  decade for forced inoculation centers we were covering that in FEMA documents
[26:33.760 --> 26:37.680]  yesterday how they're gonna use sports stadiums high schools Walmart's to lock
[26:37.680 --> 26:44.080]  you down and they tell the police these are civil insurrection camps and in
[26:44.080 --> 26:47.560]  Walmart is allied with the Defense Department that's come out so is
[26:47.560 --> 26:51.280]  Google that's now coming out mainstream news again we told you about that six
[26:51.280 --> 26:58.080]  years ago on Google had mr. Steele a retired CIA expert in computer
[26:58.080 --> 27:02.480]  information analysis came on and broke that and boy you got a lot of heat after
[27:02.480 --> 27:05.880]  that happened and said basically I've gotten some heat I'm not coming back on
[27:05.880 --> 27:11.400]  your show when he when he let the cat out of the bag on that but a report of an
[27:11.400 --> 27:15.800]  armed man acting erratically in a Walmart parking lot led to the store
[27:15.800 --> 27:19.840]  being temporarily locked down before the Kirksville police that's in Missouri
[27:19.840 --> 27:25.320]  responded and defuse the situation with no injuries oh they defused it kind of
[27:25.320 --> 27:28.320]  like the city of Austin just bought a couple million dollars worth of robots
[27:28.320 --> 27:31.600]  so now they're out there shutting down the highways every week you know
[27:31.600 --> 27:36.040]  defusing cardboard boxes but they'll go ahead and blow the cardboard box up to
[27:36.040 --> 27:40.480]  say well we're not sure of it was a bomb or in San Diego we got to burn this
[27:40.480 --> 27:45.320]  guy's house down because we think there's bombs in there no Jerry no no no
[27:45.320 --> 27:49.120]  proof no nothing we're just gonna burn his house down because the bombs are too
[27:49.120 --> 27:55.200]  dangerous it's just this made-up baloney to create hysteria according to the
[27:55.200 --> 27:59.000]  Kirksville police chief Jim Hughes a passerby stopped at Kirksville police
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.880]  officer and said they're seeing an individual acting erratically in a truck
[28:01.880 --> 28:05.520]  here the Walmart parking lot shortly before 2 30 p.m. the passerby believed
[28:05.520 --> 28:10.760]  the individual had a gun to his head we do take these things we don't take these
[28:10.760 --> 28:15.040]  things lightly Hughes said especially nowadays yeah especially nowadays they're
[28:15.040 --> 28:19.200]  creating all this mind control hysteria the KPD responded to control the scene
[28:19.200 --> 28:22.760]  in order to lock down to the store both to keep shoppers in and prevent the
[28:22.760 --> 28:25.960]  individual from entering the store then they went up and talked to him and found
[28:25.960 --> 28:29.640]  out he was having a long discussion on a cell phone I can't tell you how many
[28:29.640 --> 28:34.000]  times I've had some emergency at the office come up an alarm go off or a
[28:34.000 --> 28:40.520]  water you know valve breaking or an air conditioner leaking and my wife goes

[29:20.800 --> 29:24.880]  trusting each other meanwhile the big corrupt government is out of control and
[29:24.880 --> 29:30.360]  here's another article from CBS News in Dallas Dallas police officer charged
[29:30.360 --> 29:35.880]  with stealing from crime stoppers they reportedly put in $250,000 quarter
[29:35.880 --> 29:41.600]  million in fake tips and paid themselves through the tip line that's what this

[32:22.680 --> 32:27.440]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[32:27.440 --> 32:31.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[32:31.240 --> 32:34.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[32:34.840 --> 32:39.200]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[32:39.200 --> 32:42.360]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[32:42.360 --> 32:46.040]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[32:46.040 --> 32:50.800]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar

[33:08.120 --> 33:11.800]  all over the country police under federal grants are now running warrantless
[33:11.800 --> 33:19.000]  checkpoints and taking blood at them and on top of that the Atlanta police now
[33:19.000 --> 33:23.400]  strip people in broad daylight and do cavity searches on the side of the highway
[33:23.400 --> 33:32.520]  that is out of WSB TV the police admit it so now to prove you're not with Al
[33:32.520 --> 33:38.240]  Qaeda the police with no warrant are gonna do sexual assault to you basically
[33:38.240 --> 33:43.120]  and the man describes it as a sexual assault and what's our mainstream media
[33:43.120 --> 33:46.320]  doing making fun of Jesse Ventura filing a lawsuit calling it sexual
[33:46.320 --> 33:51.000]  assault you know since when do men not get our rights you've got all these
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.680]  women that are sexual abuse victims freaking out filing suits over the
[33:54.680 --> 33:58.760]  TSA and winning especially in Amarillo last year when they pulled the woman's
[33:58.760 --> 34:03.520]  blouse off and her bra and then said man you're good looking she has witnesses
[34:03.520 --> 34:07.600]  that's why they settled and then she was crying at the gate and men came and
[34:07.600 --> 34:11.400]  said I wish I could be part of the search they were so attracted to her and
[34:11.400 --> 34:14.760]  I've seen her on the news very good looking I mean these are men who could
[34:14.760 --> 34:18.960]  never get a woman and they don't understand it's all about loving your
[34:18.960 --> 34:23.560]  woman it's all about the woman wanting you it's all about the enjoyment of
[34:23.560 --> 34:28.600]  liking each other these are goons who cannot probably ever had a woman in
[34:28.600 --> 34:32.440]  their life and they're such animals they run up to a woman is crying and say
[34:32.440 --> 34:37.760]  man I really wish I could have been part of that search I mean these are
[34:37.760 --> 34:41.960]  animals ladies and gentlemen these are complete and out of control this is what
[34:41.960 --> 34:47.440]  tyranny is the government hires a bunch of idiots the good cops quit the good
[34:47.440 --> 34:52.440]  TSA people been quitting I'm not saying they're all like this but it's an
[34:52.440 --> 34:56.640]  atmosphere that allows these type of animals to get away with this in Ventura
[34:56.640 --> 35:01.120]  I've been there when they're sticking their hand between his legs and that's
[35:01.120 --> 35:05.280]  in his lawsuit I've watched it and when they mean he's he was mad I have seen
[35:05.280 --> 35:10.200]  mainstream media spin it and say it's a publicity stunt guess what he's had ABC
[35:10.200 --> 35:16.360]  NBC Good Morning America all call him in Mexico and he said no I'll come on your
[35:16.360 --> 35:20.520]  show in April I'm done I'm not responding if he was wanting publicity and
[35:20.520 --> 35:24.040]  he is gonna come on in April when he gets back for a couple weeks he's down in
[35:24.040 --> 35:31.400]  Mexico right now doesn't even have phone he's just got email but you know again
[35:31.400 --> 35:35.640]  we're the victims of this and the media spins it like all this guy in Atlanta he
[35:35.640 --> 35:39.560]  should have liked the cops putting their hands inside of his body all right
[35:39.560 --> 35:42.200]  we're gonna go to Wayne Madsen here in just a moment for the balance of the
[35:42.200 --> 35:45.960]  hour obviously with the geopolitical ramifications of what's happening in
[35:45.960 --> 35:52.080]  Egypt Tunisia and Yemen and what he thinks is going on behind the scenes I'm
[35:52.080 --> 35:55.920]  gonna give you a brief synopsis of my analysis of this Lindsey Williams is on
[35:55.920 --> 36:00.120]  the last 30 minutes with Bob Chapman while he's on with us we've got of course
[36:00.120 --> 36:04.480]  Laurie Pratt popping in with Obama blowing the trumpet sending up the red
[36:04.480 --> 36:10.040]  balloon throwing down the gauntlet opening the drawbridge whatever the
[36:10.040 --> 36:15.600]  floodgates and saying yeah we're gonna go with hardcore gun grabbing assault
[36:15.600 --> 36:20.000]  weapons ban extra judicial banning of people owning guns basically the no
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.720]  buy list that don't just like the no fly list that his former chief of staff
[36:23.720 --> 36:27.440]  Emmanuel called for where you're just magically can't buy a gun anymore because
[36:27.440 --> 36:33.080]  they think you're unstable that's all coming and they want to only let you
[36:33.080 --> 36:37.600]  buy one gun per purchase they've told us what they want and now they're
[36:37.600 --> 36:40.960]  announcing that they're going to roll it out in the next week and a half so
[36:40.960 --> 36:47.440]  that's coming up before we go to Wayne Madsen I just wanted to point out the
[36:47.440 --> 36:54.680]  listeners that we continue to upgrade and expand prison planet dot TV in April
[36:54.680 --> 36:58.760]  it'll be up seven years there are tens of thousands of pieces of media there's
[36:58.760 --> 37:03.560]  every show going back seven years with a higher quality podcast there's my book
[37:03.560 --> 37:06.680]  Paul Watson's book that are out of print there's all these special report
[37:06.680 --> 37:09.680]  videos we've been flying all over the country and the world we're going to
[37:09.680 --> 37:13.160]  Canada and other areas with these special interviews that are being posted
[37:13.160 --> 37:19.160]  exclusively there and your support of prison planet dot TV also finances much
[37:19.160 --> 37:24.600]  of our invaluable operations and we're running that special till the end of the
[37:24.600 --> 37:32.840]  week five plus months free right now at prison planet dot TV and we've also got
[37:32.840 --> 37:38.600]  the draft Ron Paul a limited run limited edition t-shirts available at
[37:38.600 --> 37:42.360]  info wars dot com and we also have a limited time I'm only gonna have these
[37:42.360 --> 37:48.520]  for just a few months and that's the V for victory t-shirt which really goes
[37:48.520 --> 37:54.840]  back to the archers over 600 700 going back 800 years ago in England that was
[37:54.840 --> 37:59.280]  their symbol to the invading Norman and French and others was they would do the
[37:59.280 --> 38:03.760]  V symbol of their fingers that's actually the oldest in Europe use of it
[38:03.760 --> 38:07.560]  saying we got our fingers we've got our longbows because the Normans whenever
[38:07.560 --> 38:10.680]  they would capture the Anglo-Saxons would cut their index and middle fingers
[38:10.680 --> 38:15.560]  off so I went with it because it's the V for you know victory against Nazi
[38:15.560 --> 38:19.880]  occupation it's a symbol everybody knows victory against the globalist it's
[38:19.880 --> 38:23.840]  simple but I've actually gone back and on the deep research it comes from the
[38:23.840 --> 38:27.240]  archers and that's why the British came up with it originally and then had the
[38:27.240 --> 38:31.320]  French adopted as the resistance so those t-shirts are now available and I've
[38:31.320 --> 38:36.000]  got more to say about this whole movement coming up later in the next hour so

[38:59.920 --> 39:03.200]  well getting the movement going the self-fulfilling prophecy of getting
[39:03.200 --> 39:08.720]  Ron Paul to run for president those are available along with the v-shirts as well
[39:08.720 --> 39:14.640]  on the online video bookstore apparel shopping cart at infowars.com okay
[39:14.640 --> 39:17.600]  we're going to Wayne Madsen I just want to give you a one-minute summation of
[39:17.600 --> 39:32.000]  what I believe is happening here I am not a hundred percent sure that Western
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.960]  governments aren't involved in this because we know NATO the US Israel many
[39:36.960 --> 39:40.640]  others on record have financed revolutions all over the world but
[39:40.640 --> 39:45.120]  they're almost always in countries that are run by people that aren't going
[39:45.120 --> 39:51.560]  under IMF World Bank control Tunisia Yemen they're even having unrest in
[39:51.560 --> 40:00.120]  Jordan in all of these places but in around Egypt these are dictatorships
[40:00.120 --> 40:06.760]  and you see Biden defending that right now and major newspapers are saying why
[40:06.760 --> 40:12.120]  is the US defending another dictator the public around half the public is on
[40:12.120 --> 40:17.240]  some form of food assistance right at half the population makes two dollars
[40:17.240 --> 40:21.240]  or less a day you look at these rioters these demonstrators they're they're
[40:21.240 --> 40:25.520]  very skinny they look malnourished they're hungry and the IMF and World Bank
[40:25.520 --> 40:30.280]  have demanded in the last six months that the food allotments be cut imagine
[40:30.280 --> 40:33.560]  you have the 43 million Americans on food stamps had that taken you'd have
[40:33.560 --> 40:38.000]  unrest within a week or two these people are starving in many cases in Egypt
[40:38.000 --> 40:42.000]  in Tunisia in Yemen where the food allotments are being cut especially in
[40:42.000 --> 40:49.240]  Tunisia and in in in Egypt and so no matter how you slice it the big central
[40:49.240 --> 40:53.800]  banks are creating this and on top of them ordering the food cut the prices
[40:53.800 --> 40:57.720]  are up because of dollar devaluation worldwide and food is dominated in
[40:57.720 --> 41:03.040]  dollars in those nations so commodities are going up not just oil but also food
[41:03.040 --> 41:07.560]  so I don't see why the globalists would want to do this and why they want to be
[41:07.560 --> 41:11.920]  behind it some people are saying there's evidence of that Egypt has shut down the
[41:11.920 --> 41:16.160]  internet the reports at Mubarak has fled the police the last three hours the
[41:16.160 --> 41:18.640]  New York Times are reporting are stopping to fight with the public and
[41:18.640 --> 41:22.120]  shaking hands and drinking bottled water together the police are sharing their
[41:22.120 --> 41:25.360]  bottled water with them let's get Wayne Madsen formally with the National
[41:25.360 --> 41:29.960]  Security Agency he's written for dozens of major newspapers and magazines and
[41:29.960 --> 41:34.240]  of course is a routine analyst an expert that joins us as websites the Wayne
[41:34.240 --> 41:38.280]  Madsen report dot com Wayne what's your breakdown and your take on what's
[41:38.280 --> 41:42.640]  happening in the Middle East North Africa well I think what's happening is
[41:42.640 --> 41:46.840]  the same thing we've seen happen on the streets of Athens that we've seen it in
[41:46.840 --> 41:52.960]  London we've seen it in Ireland and Iceland this is a reaction against what
[41:52.960 --> 41:57.680]  what the global bankers have done to these economies this this is a Mediterranean
[41:57.680 --> 42:01.360]  issue we've seen it play out in Italy we've seen it play out in Greece and
[42:01.360 --> 42:06.520]  Spain and why should North Africa be any different of course they in North
[42:06.520 --> 42:11.760]  Africa these a long time you have supported bugs that we've relied on
[42:11.760 --> 42:20.040]  Ben Ali in Tunisia Mubarak in Egypt and and these others and I think this is
[42:20.040 --> 42:26.600]  payback now I find it interesting that the WikiLeaks cables talk about Egypt
[42:26.600 --> 42:31.120]  they just released a bunch I guess in the last 24 hours but I think the people
[42:31.120 --> 42:35.600]  who might think that what we're going to see is like a liberal democracy arise
[42:35.600 --> 42:40.400]  where the new leaders will go off to Davos and break bread with those those
[42:40.400 --> 42:44.720]  hoodlums and gangsters that meet there every year are mistaken we know that
[42:44.720 --> 42:51.080]  the street Arab Street is not all that big on these US and Western imposed
[42:51.080 --> 42:55.200]  dictators and we're seeing I think that play out in Egypt right now in fact
[42:55.200 --> 43:00.280]  that's always been a bigger beef in the Arab and Central Asian nations that our
[43:00.280 --> 43:05.040]  governments continue to install and fund dictators from the Shaw running right
[43:05.040 --> 43:09.480]  through to today with Mubarak they're more angry about that than the US
[43:09.480 --> 43:15.120]  military presence oh absolutely so so the people that you know these commentators
[43:15.120 --> 43:18.840]  that are saying oh it's gonna be wonderful we're gonna have you know new
[43:18.840 --> 43:22.720]  governments in the Arab world they're gonna be moderate they're gonna be pro
[43:22.720 --> 43:27.400]  Israel I forget it that the Arab the Arab Street especially people in Egypt
[43:27.400 --> 43:31.680]  know how Mubarak is brutalized those eight convoys trying to get into Gaza
[43:31.680 --> 43:36.440]  they're at one with the people of that beleaguered territory and and they're
[43:36.440 --> 43:40.920]  not gonna be sitting down and and inviting the head of the IMF and World
[43:40.920 --> 43:47.120]  Bank to Cairo for meetings on austerity plans and and the kinds of things so you
[43:47.120 --> 43:53.080]  agree with my analysis then because people I respect are Trump are with
[43:53.080 --> 44:00.040]  really no evidence I've been seeing claims that that the West is involved in
[44:00.040 --> 44:03.920]  this and that it was WikiLeaks that triggered it but I don't really see
[44:03.920 --> 44:08.040]  that we've already been seeing unrest I mean this really comes down to food yeah
[44:08.040 --> 44:12.840]  I think what we may have seen there may be a little bit of truth in what these
[44:12.840 --> 44:16.120]  other folks are saying I think there's been an attempt to co-opt the
[44:16.120 --> 44:20.840]  opposition in some of these countries to try to tamp it down control the
[44:20.840 --> 44:25.480]  opposition and I think that's failed when we hear in Tunisia the Jasmine
[44:25.480 --> 44:31.080]  Revolution now we're hearing about the day of rage in Egypt and in Yemen and
[44:31.080 --> 44:37.120]  in Lebanon well that all smacks of George Soros funded theme revolution but I
[44:37.120 --> 44:41.520]  think in this case they've bitten off more than they can chew we're not going
[44:41.520 --> 44:46.400]  to see them control these revolutions but the government to come to power know
[44:46.400 --> 44:51.560]  fully well what people like George Soros and Barack Obama and George W. Bush have
[44:51.560 --> 44:55.280]  done to their part of the world and they're not happy about it we're now
[44:55.280 --> 44:59.400]  seeing similar statements what we saw last year out of Davos from George
[44:59.400 --> 45:04.680]  Soros about how he's having a wonderful crisis now he's saying this this this
[45:04.680 --> 45:09.840]  economic turmoil has been very good for me he's up there gloating over it and I
[45:09.840 --> 45:15.880]  saw an Associated Press article on Monday out of Davos headline Davos calls
[45:15.880 --> 45:22.160]  for 100 trillion in additional credit which means 100 trillion of taxpayer
[45:22.160 --> 45:27.280]  backed money for them to then go loan to individuals corporations and countries
[45:27.280 --> 45:32.960]  in some cases as high as 30% annual compounding interest I mean I mean these
[45:32.960 --> 45:39.480]  guys are so brazen or or hooks fulfilled I don't know what term to use hubris
[45:39.480 --> 45:43.600]  filled when they're just saying give us 100 trillion more and you know through
[45:43.600 --> 45:47.200]  the classic fractional reserve banking leverage that would then be one
[45:47.200 --> 45:51.280]  quadrillion or 1,000 trillion but now through the derivatives model it's
[45:51.280 --> 45:56.520]  almost unlimited I mean this is insane well I hope these bankers and Davos are
[45:56.520 --> 46:01.000]  watching what's happening in the streets of Cairo, Alexandria, Tunis and
[46:01.000 --> 46:05.640]  Yemen because you know that I think this is not going to be contained in the
[46:05.640 --> 46:10.680]  Arab world we're already seeing protests in some of these 10 ten pod
[46:10.680 --> 46:15.360]  dictatorships in Africa these Western installed leaders there and we're seeing
[46:15.360 --> 46:20.880]  it play out in Europe I would note that what's happening in Tunisia and
[46:20.880 --> 46:26.640]  Algeria let's not forget that there's large North African populations that
[46:26.640 --> 46:32.160]  in for example in France and they see Sarkozy as no different than some of
[46:32.160 --> 46:37.000]  these ten horned dictators that they're chasing out North Africa he's he
[46:37.000 --> 46:41.320]  basically was imposed on the French people and I think we're going to see
[46:41.320 --> 46:46.760]  shockwaves go through some of these European countries now as far as the
[46:46.760 --> 46:50.840]  United States what happened yesterday that commission that Obama named on
[46:50.840 --> 46:55.880]  the the Wall Street yes go came out and said we're all at fault now I'm not at
[46:55.880 --> 46:59.160]  fault you're not at fault who are they talking about that's what a state of the
[46:59.160 --> 47:02.880]  Union was about was this collective guilt and that if you don't go along with
[47:02.880 --> 47:07.200]  what the bankers say you don't believe in America anymore and that we've got to
[47:07.200 --> 47:12.360]  just sit down and have austerity and accept the carbon tax green jobs that
[47:12.360 --> 47:17.480]  are going to be everywhere and and everything is going to be just fine I
[47:17.480 --> 47:23.720]  mean this is incredible well yeah but I I don't know you know I don't know what
[47:23.720 --> 47:27.000]  it would take for the American people that you know do what they're doing in
[47:27.000 --> 47:31.040]  Cairo if the American people think they have a representative government or
[47:31.040 --> 47:35.320]  sadly mistaken and that because we saw that play out the state of the Union
[47:35.320 --> 47:40.120]  where basically you had a meeting that's it the annual meeting of the
[47:40.120 --> 47:43.960]  oligarchy and then and they're all sitting there you know everything is for
[47:43.960 --> 47:48.040]  public to the function it's sort of like when the Queen opens up parliament it's
[47:48.040 --> 47:54.040]  all popping up in circumstance Wayne Madsen what do you make of the statements
[47:54.040 --> 47:59.280]  by Biden that that mubarak is not a dictator that's like saying if a red
[47:59.280 --> 48:03.240]  cardinal is sitting in the tree outside my backyard that it's not a red cardinal
[48:03.240 --> 48:08.600]  it's like saying the sun comes up at that big ball of ignited gas isn't isn't
[48:08.600 --> 48:13.120]  isn't our son here's the Sydney Morning Herald headline revolution is in the
[48:13.120 --> 48:17.800]  air but us sticks the same old script Washington appears addicted to propping
[48:17.800 --> 48:23.080]  up tyrants you know a what's your take on just a week and a half ago our
[48:23.080 --> 48:28.160]  government saying don't call you know even going after Harry Reid when he
[48:28.160 --> 48:33.720]  finally had a Freudian slip and called who a dictator now we're being told that
[48:33.720 --> 48:36.120]  you know we're not allowed to talk about about mubarak even though he's a
[48:36.120 --> 48:42.200]  horrible murdering torturing dictator we're told he's a great guy I mean what
[48:42.200 --> 48:45.880]  does this say about our government though that they love dictatorship that
[48:45.880 --> 48:49.280]  tells us what type of government they want here yeah well that's because we're
[48:49.280 --> 48:53.840]  a dictatorship but you know what's not meant words here I mean what we hear
[48:53.840 --> 48:57.720]  every day about police brutality in this country and and that they're frittering
[48:57.720 --> 49:02.480]  away a more constitutional rights I mean and Biden as far as Biden's concern I
[49:02.480 --> 49:10.000]  mean this guy always allows his is a overactive mouth override his lack of
[49:10.000 --> 49:16.240]  gray matter I mean he's been trying to grow hair plugs for how long now that
[49:16.240 --> 49:20.000]  hair plugs need something to root in and it's hard to grow the one what's
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.640]  underneath is a vacuum when we're about to go to break but I wanted to throw this
[49:24.640 --> 49:28.240]  point out the New York Times and others are reporting but it's not getting a
[49:28.240 --> 49:34.920]  lot of attention that in many areas of Alexandria and now Cairo the police will
[49:34.920 --> 49:38.560]  get into an hour long two-hour battle and then they're just joining as the
[49:38.560 --> 49:43.080]  people's you know chant you know be in Egyptian don't be a traitor and the
[49:43.080 --> 49:46.720]  police are throwing down their weapons and going and hugging and joining and
[49:46.720 --> 49:52.800]  giving their water and and and their Gatorade and things to the people I mean
[49:52.800 --> 49:58.080]  that looks like shades of 89 in Romania all right and there's also reports on
[49:58.080 --> 50:02.280]  Al Jazeera that the military is now coming out and flashing the beat
[50:02.280 --> 50:07.080]  starting to the protesters so I would say Mubarak he's not at the airport
[50:07.080 --> 50:11.800]  getting ready to fly out that may happen very soon and you know the US has
[50:11.800 --> 50:16.520]  trained a lot of these Egyptian military officers but this may be paybacks as
[50:16.520 --> 50:21.080]  well you know we trained them we brought them over here in some cases for
[50:21.080 --> 50:25.520]  training but they know full well what it's like to be an Arab in the United
[50:25.520 --> 50:28.800]  States can you imagine what they fit they face at the airport even though
[50:28.800 --> 50:34.680]  they may be traveling with diplomatic passports you know you you read what
[50:34.680 --> 50:39.960]  you saw and if the military takes part with the people in this revolution I
[50:39.960 --> 50:47.160]  don't know if there is grand files all that pro-american by the way Mubarak's
[50:47.160 --> 50:50.680]  now called out the army their machine gunning people on the streets and that
[50:50.680 --> 50:54.280]  caused the police to now remove their uniforms they've begun joining that's

[54:00.000 --> 54:14.400]  Al Arabia the New York Times and others are reporting that many of the police
[54:14.400 --> 54:19.040]  are now not just hugging and giving their water which doesn't sound like a lot
[54:19.040 --> 54:24.000]  here it's a lot there with the population near starvation and now it's
[54:24.000 --> 54:30.360]  confirmed Mubarak has called out the military to start just shooting people
[54:30.360 --> 54:35.240]  and the same thing happened with Shilchescu and then now the police and
[54:35.240 --> 54:41.520]  the military are gonna start shooting back so this happens over and over again
[54:41.520 --> 54:45.680]  throughout history it's touch-and-go what's going to happen but this is a
[54:45.680 --> 54:51.120]  very explosive situation with a Suez Canal going through that that that
[54:51.120 --> 54:57.960]  region but I tell you Mubarak it looks like is in serious danger of being
[54:57.960 --> 55:04.320]  overthrown right now Wayne Madsen I would say so and I think what what the US
[55:04.320 --> 55:10.080]  should be also concerned about is is who's next that we got to remember that
[55:10.080 --> 55:16.560]  the US has been supporting the Saudi regime for a number of years mostly
[55:16.560 --> 55:21.760]  over oil and the eastern province of Saudi Arabia has a majority shea
[55:21.760 --> 55:27.800]  population if you see them rise up their natural ally is Iran what what what the
[55:27.800 --> 55:32.800]  United States gonna do then try to try to fight Israel's war in Iran and Saudi
[55:32.800 --> 55:37.760]  Arabia I mean I think this also sends a message to Israel that things in their
[55:37.760 --> 55:42.080]  neighborhood are changing and the Palestinians are also watching what's
[55:42.080 --> 55:46.720]  going on they know that some of their leaders were from these Palestine papers
[55:46.720 --> 55:50.040]  that were released some of their own leaders were willing to give too much
[55:50.040 --> 55:55.280]  away and remember what happened three and a half years ago in Lebanon in that
[55:55.280 --> 56:00.440]  several month war the main you armor columns got beaten the helicopters got
[56:00.440 --> 56:05.880]  beaten by actually trained people that that were in their anti-tank dugouts
[56:05.880 --> 56:11.080]  were ready to fight to the death I mean this is a serious situation how do you
[56:11.080 --> 56:15.200]  see this affecting energy prices gold's exploding I see oils going up right now
[56:15.200 --> 56:21.000]  well let's let's look at the the energy countries there's a thought that
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.800]  Algeria may be next of course that's a big supplier a natural pass to the US if
[56:25.800 --> 56:32.480]  Saudi Arabia goes well there's a price oil I mean the eastern provinces that
[56:32.480 --> 56:36.360]  towards the oil is that's where the refineries are that's where the tankers
[56:36.360 --> 56:42.840]  pull in the load up so we could see a huge increase in oil prices that if this
[56:42.840 --> 56:47.200]  that if this Arab revolt and we know what the British and the US have done
[56:47.200 --> 56:53.800]  before if these Arab uprisings take over those ports I think you're going to see
[56:53.800 --> 56:57.560]  US special forces sent in to try to secure it and that's going to be an
[56:57.560 --> 57:03.920]  unbelievable bloodbath oh absolutely if the US special forces that we don't know
[57:03.920 --> 57:08.200]  whether the you know the US has a strategic relationship with Egypt we
[57:08.200 --> 57:12.800]  don't know if the US is in there giving them advice and if it if an American
[57:12.800 --> 57:18.680]  special forces or CIA agent is caught anywhere near advising the Mubarak
[57:18.680 --> 57:21.480]  government you know they're going to be hanging from a lamppost in Cairo
[57:21.480 --> 57:27.440]  Alexandria or Port Said and that will supercharge the rebellion oh yeah but
[57:27.440 --> 57:32.320]  well here in this country is just like this bug that shot these two guys in
[57:32.320 --> 57:36.800]  Pakistan who claims he's a diplomat sounds like he's a blackwater guy you
[57:36.800 --> 57:42.280]  know people around the world get to set up with these these overpaid people that
[57:42.280 --> 57:46.320]  we send to these other countries military civilian or otherwise they live
[57:46.320 --> 57:50.520]  like Kingswell the army I mean I've had army officers on they are totally sick
[57:50.520 --> 57:54.080]  of them and all those rumors we heard five six seven years ago about black
[57:54.080 --> 57:59.440]  water are now in federal court black water on cocaine running around naked in
[57:59.440 --> 58:03.720]  the streets at night shooting up people's cars for fun it turns out that's
[58:03.720 --> 58:07.720]  coming out in federal lawsuits well right and then we've got we've got this
[58:07.720 --> 58:12.800]  pencil sharpener general Petraeus who runs around like he's sort of American
[58:12.800 --> 58:18.880]  proton you know I'm saying you know who elected him to be anything in
[58:18.880 --> 58:23.640]  Afghanistan or Pakistan or anywhere else the guy the only combat that you
[58:23.640 --> 58:29.120]  ever had was probably a paper cut all right stay there when we're doing five

[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:12.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:19.760]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:33.200]  Alex Jones well Wayne Madsen's our gas farm with the NSA and of course in the Navy syndicate of columnist reporter on national security issues and he's basically
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:37.040]  occurring with my analysis I'm seeing a lot of other people claim that the West is
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:41.920]  behind this this does not fit in to their overall strategy Paul Joseph Watson has
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.520]  an article dealing with this at prison planet dot com Brzezinski feared global
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:51.160]  awakening has arrived monumental worldwide rallying cry for freedom
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:55.480]  threatens to derail new world order agenda this is not just a Muslim thing
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.200]  as the media is trying to say look at these Muslim extremists these people
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:02.600]  starve to death folks the IMF you know the globalist to have something to do
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.160]  with it it's by ordering these countries to pay more and more on debts
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.960]  ordering the countries in shock therapy to cut back on their food stamps from
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:14.520]  close to half the populations on them in Egypt alone ordering you know the
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:18.360]  further dollar devaluation which you see more overseas than domestically so
[01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:21.440]  things cost more for them because even though they have their own currency it's
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:26.560]  based in dollars Wayne in closing where do you see this headed from your
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:31.760]  geopolitical research I mean how do you see this unfolding and and do you
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:35.800]  agree with Watson's article that the global awakening really has arrived oh
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.840]  yes I think there's you know the genies out of a bottle now and they won't be
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:44.520]  able to put it back in I think what we're seeing now in Lebanon you've got a
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.560]  government the US doesn't like but clearly it's a coalition government and
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.960]  it also includes has the law which we don't want to deal with I think based
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:59.560]  on the Palestine papers that's only going to increase popularity of Hamas we
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:04.440]  kind of deal with these that this is a situation of the real real politics
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:09.960]  situation to keep falling his ball on Hamas terrorist organizations and acting
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:14.840]  like they're not there is ridiculous we're also going to be faced with these
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:19.600]  new governments it was in Tunisia which is changing every day they would they
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:24.560]  want all the old vestiges of the US and French imposed regime gone we may have
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:30.200]  a new government in Egypt we have a South German and North after the
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:34.360]  revolution there we're going to have to deal with the situation as it exists and
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:39.120]  if the US wants to start sending special forces into those countries well you
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.800]  know what the body bags are going to keep coming back and they're going to
[01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.600]  increase the numbers and that's not and we don't want to hear from Obama that
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:50.000]  that's a just war because if we impose ourselves in these countries that's not
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:54.160]  a just war that's imperialism and it's worse and we get what we should get
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.240]  what's coming to it well again when we say get what's coming to us this is in
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:02.000]  our country we're run by these offshore banks that have created 1.5
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.880]  quadrillion in derivatives and say that we owe this money as you said earlier we
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:09.720]  don't owe this on record we could cut every social program out there and it
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:13.800]  wouldn't pay one-tenth of what these bankers say is we got to what Ron Paul
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:18.680]  said just like when an individual goes bankrupt we've got to write off this
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:22.440]  this so-called debt that the bankers have had a sign on to globally all these
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:26.880]  foreign bailouts write it off in the foreign aid pull our military out of
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:32.120]  Iraq and Afghanistan and pull it all in but the bankers just are telling us
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:36.880]  with austerity cut all of our programs here so that even more money can go to
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:42.280]  them yeah we got it you know we we got it this defense budget has to be slashed
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:47.440]  dramatically so we don't need 50 bases in Germany we don't need you know a half
[01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:54.200]  dozen or more bases in in Okinawa and South Korea and these other locations we
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:59.440]  can need to bring these bases back we we can't afford it it's it's it's just
[01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:04.680]  prolonging the American hegemon and this is a failed empire and we have to

[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:04.840]  night fell president Mubarak has expanded the night curfew nationwide state
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:09.480]  TV reports Egypt's military deployed on the streets of Cairo to enforce the
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:12.800]  nighttime curfew there's incredible videos of them just shooting unarmed
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:17.360]  people as thousands of protesters it's hundreds of thousands tried to storm the
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.000]  foreign ministry and state TV building in Cairo the day of rioting and chaos
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:26.560]  amounted to the biggest challenge ever to the authoritarian president Hosni
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:32.280]  Mubarak's 30-year regime well wait a minute the vice president Joe Biden is
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:36.720]  running around saying he's not a dictator so if Joe Biden says the sky is
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:44.480]  red and you say it's blue what do you do if he says up is down and down is up in
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:50.560]  blackish white I mean they told us that who Jin Tao isn't a dictator and China's
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.480]  got all these stilted trade laws where it's not just competing against all
[01:09:54.480 --> 01:10:00.720]  their slave labor we're competing against all of their internal tariffs
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:03.960]  that aren't declared but are there to keep our goods out I mean this is all
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:10.360]  just a disgusting disgusting new world order operation and the populations of
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:14.280]  Ireland have been rioting the population of Greece has been rioting much of
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:17.720]  Eastern Europe's been rioting off and on the last six months and now what's
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:21.160]  happening there our media saying look at these Muslim extremists are they
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:31.000]  extremist in Dublin are they extremist in Athens are they extremist in other
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.640]  areas of the world I mean are they all Muslims no they're not Muslims so they're
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.920]  trying to make this a Muslim issue these people are being raped by the new
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:42.520]  world order and they're tired of a dictator for 30 years they've had enough
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:47.720]  now here's a big article that I think is incredibly important you know Google
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:51.160]  has announced they're gonna start filtering out alternative news recites we
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:54.040]  wrote that article Monday drugs report linked to it on Monday and Tuesday it
[01:10:54.040 --> 01:10:58.120]  got record readership we've never had an article but be read by that many people
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:03.080]  I think this one two million people hit the site to read it just that one

[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:15.320]  think this article is one of the most important ever and you hear our media
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:20.560]  Associated Press CBS News the last week going Obama wants his kill switch
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:24.920]  Obama wants his kill switch the kill switch is already in place and you saw
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:29.600]  Egypt flip a switch and the internet's boom down and they already have their
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:34.040]  own internal government internet and that's what internet to and this slow
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:40.160]  migration towards a censorship taxed internet drivers license ID controlled
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:45.680]  web so I'm gonna go ahead and go over this article by Steve Watson we need to
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:54.040]  get this out to everybody and the best place for total coverage that I've seen

[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:13.320]  Brzezinski's feared global awakening has arrived monumental worldwide rallying

[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:24.040]  over that report but this report again also from prison planet calm Steve
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:29.200]  Watson Egypt's internet kill switch coming to America and it's also going up
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:34.440]  on info wars calm in response to widespread protest and mass unrest the
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.600]  authoritarian Egyptian government has completely shut down the country's
[01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:42.200]  access to the internet eliminating the use of social networking websites other
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:45.760]  effective tools of communication and organization and effectively sealing
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:50.720]  Egypt off from the rest of the world Tunisia has also done that and this is
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:55.040]  these government grids this is what cyber security admittedly is set up to do
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:13:01.200]  this is the internet kill switch and they're getting you ready for it internet
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:06.680]  intelligence authority renaissance has confirmed that virtually all of Egypt's
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:15.080]  internet access are now unreachable worldwide at 22 34 UTC Greenwich
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:21.480]  meantime they observed that I guess that's Egypt time virtually
[01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:25.520]  simultaneous withdrawal of all routes to Egyptian networks in the internet's
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:32.360]  global routing table approximately 3500 individual BGP routes were withdrawn
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.320]  leaving no valid paths by which the rest of the world could continue to exchange
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:40.040]  internet traffic with Egypt service providers and why are they doing that so
[01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:45.160]  people can't upload the YouTube videos in fact guys if you just go to drudge I
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.960]  think we've got it up as well I think I saw it on prison planet this morning
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:53.040]  man shot in Egypt there's a whole bunch of those videos that are still on our
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.000]  YouTube in the US but now people can't upload so all you're getting is reports
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  of smoke fire the army called out police joining them the police joining the
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:10.420]  the demonstrators who are now torching government facilities and Western
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:15.560]  corporate headquarters I mean it is bedlam we just showed you video of a
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:21.320]  man being shot from about 200 yards by paramilitary police not shot with
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:28.080]  rubber bullets shot with a high caliber rifle round and you could see he's dead
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:32.960]  on arrival dead very soon after he was hit and there are reports that they are
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:37.640]  just machine gunning people right now so of course they shut the web off they
[01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.480]  have arrested and this is an example of what will happen in the West if they
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:44.920]  drop the hammer to bring us into the new world order if there's riots over
[01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:48.800]  starvation which we're a week away from at any time I'm saying it's gonna happen
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:52.360]  in a week I'm saying from the store shelves being emptied from the welfare
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:59.080]  cards not working you know the digital food cards the Lone Star cards we have
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.080]  here in Texas people don't have physical food stamps anymore they have credit
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.960]  cards we're a week away from that according to the Ministry of Defense
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:10.760]  in England and our own Pentagon studies within seven days complete rioting in
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:16.840]  bedlam within 10 complete lawlessness and and murder just explodes and within
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:24.600]  15 days near universal cannibalism 15 days in every study in countless
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:28.760]  countries they will be roasting humans on spits I'm not saying that's coming
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:34.240]  but that's listen I remember the Washington Post in 2000 in Argentina
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:40.880]  which there was a saying 60 70 80 years ago as rich as an Argentine on average
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:46.160]  in the entire Western Hemisphere the Argentines were more wealthy than
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:50.440]  Americans they were some of the wealthiest people in the world on average
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.600]  they had the one of the biggest middle classes in the world only rivaled if you
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:59.920]  go back 80 years ago to the breakdowns by Switzerland nobody else had more
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:04.160]  money per capita beautiful culture beautiful architecture super smart
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:08.720]  people and the offshore banks came in and took over and they imploded their
[01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:15.520]  economy again in 2000 2001 the Washington Post reporter described and
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:19.520]  and other media described similar reports of an 18-wheeler filled with
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:26.240]  premium Argentinian beef dumped over and middle-class families in disheveled
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:31.560]  ripped you know fancy suits it was described as you know middle-class and
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:34.640]  wealthy families who'd been wealthy just a few weeks before before the bank
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:41.520]  shut down running out with knives chopping blobs of raw beef out of the
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:47.720]  dead cows and gobbling at children men women just bloodily like animals just
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:55.000]  gobbling and just slashing with knives okay now in the IMF World Bank
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  documents that were leaked in 2002 they described that as the IMF riot they
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.720]  actually like that because once they've imploded the economy then people riot
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.080]  and panic even more for sometimes up to six months that totally destroys any of
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:14.520]  the economy any confidence stocks bonds you name it and the IMF World Bank and
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:17.600]  come in and buy everything up for pennies on the dollar they then on average
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:22.000]  triple the price of water they put toll roads on all the existing roads they
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:29.200]  triple the price of in of energy a fuel of electric power coal power this is
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:35.000]  their program and they want to do something like that here in the United
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:41.560]  States continuing with this article we need to get out to everybody that Egypt
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:45.080]  has completely shut down their internet and then Steve Watson breaks down how
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:52.480]  the similar control grid is being set up here in the United States the Obama
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:55.640]  administration which currently funnels 1.3 billion in military aid of the
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:00.960]  Egyptian government per year refuses to condemn the mark regime indeed Joe
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:05.000]  Lieberman attempted to justify draconian legislation that would prevent and provide
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:08.400]  President Obama with a figurative kill switch to shut down parts of the
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:12.400]  internet indefinitely he cited the communist Chinese system of internet
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.800]  policing as a model which America should move towards we have a link to the
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:21.200]  video of him saying on Larry King live a year ago and he said right now China and
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.560]  other governments around the world can disconnect parts of the internet in case
[01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:32.280]  of war and we need to have that here too he said last June it's about nine months
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:39.680]  ago so we've got that situation there and again this article goes on to break
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.760]  down all the legislation they're pushing listen it doesn't matter if you're
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:47.560]  liberal conservative libertarian socialist communist whatever your
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:55.400]  political bent is religious we better hang together hang separate drudge in the
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.720]  last three years has been linking to us routinely he's accelerated that in the
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:03.600]  last six months and he mainly linked our articles about internet censorship and
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:10.040]  how it's coming if we don't hang together we're gonna lose the internet
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:15.080]  and I challenge other media like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and others who
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:19.120]  haven't really gotten into this much to come out and boldly state the facts that
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.840]  the federal government's out of control and is illegitimate and is openly
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:26.320]  moving to put the grid in place to shut the web down and sending up trial
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:32.160]  balloons on the hour to condition us to accept this we've got to get hardcore we
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:36.400]  got to stop mincing words I see all these big mainline media corporations
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:40.480]  lining up with government for promoting internet censorship because then under
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.840]  the new model that Google's announced they'll be the only ones that are
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:47.040]  searchable that's one way they want to start phasing out the freedom of the
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:51.960]  web we've got a call a spade a spade and call this what it is or they're gonna
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:56.480]  get away with so other people need to step up like Drudge and start exposing
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:01.680]  Google and the Pentagon's attack on freedom of speech in this country

[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:58.160]  cavity search buried in this ABC news piece they go on to admit and the police

[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:06.600]  strip search it should be cavity search and then buried oh they also pulled his
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:10.760]  underwear off and well I'm not gonna you know what a cavity search is I mean

[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:17.320]  the precedent that they're God you're talking on a cell phone in front of
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:21.360]  Walmart they call the police saying it's a gun it's this hysteria so we're all

[01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:38.920]  during a traffic stop have sparked an internal investigation tonight the
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:42.080]  Atlanta Police Department is telling us the evidence suggests the officers
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.600]  crossed the line the line 11 channels who's Eric Phillips is live tonight
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:51.040]  outside police headquarters with this exclusive insight Eric Joe Vita I am the
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:54.120]  only reporter to get my hands on documents relative to this case
[01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:58.680]  including this incident report which tells a very abbreviated and different
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:04.200]  version of what the victims are calling an outrageous case and so they reached
[01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:08.760]  down your pants yes yes Brian kid was riding with his friend and roommate
[01:26:08.760 --> 01:26:12.840]  Sean Venegas last June in downtown Atlanta when the two were pulled over by
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:17.760]  three APD officers later identified as part of the red dog unit they say one
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.160]  of the officers had his gun drawn and proceeded to drag them out of the car
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:25.080]  and search it against the driver's will they say they were made to pull down
[01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:29.160]  their pants and full view of others and then they say it got worse from there one
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:34.360]  of the officers actually stuck his hand down in to Sean Venegas his pants to
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.320]  search to see you know in our private areas to see if we had any drugs or
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:40.320]  anything then he says an officer committed what felt like the ultimate
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:45.600]  violation for his friend doing a body cavity search they went to his bottom
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:49.280]  part you know that's just yeah I had to look away because you know that's my
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:53.800]  friend I can't see the two men were riding here along Fulton Street on their
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:56.840]  and then they've got the incident report and I've got the police chiefs quote
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:01.280]  saying as it looks like this happened well I mean why not you've got the TSA
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:05.480]  sticking their hands down the pants down the pants and we first reported on
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:10.000]  this we've got men searching little girls you've got TSA employees going
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:13.960]  crazy trying to pick women up pulling women's shirts off their bras off
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:20.480]  they're settling these lawsuits they're doing it the cops think they're God the
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:25.800]  TSA thinks they're God they do it all because Al Qaeda hit us or because
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:29.560]  there's drugs and on every record Al Qaeda's government run the drugs are
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:33.040]  shipped in by the government and then they use it to put us in their presence
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.240]  if we're dumb enough to use it I mean it's in congressional hearings the CIA
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:44.240]  ships the schmack and the coke in now the answer to that is don't use it I
[01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:49.280]  mean it's just incredible ladies and gentlemen that we do this in this
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:54.200]  society we have more people in prison than anybody else in the world and now
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:57.880]  they're moving to try to disarm the American people when the tragedy in
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:02.640]  Tucson had nothing to do with the guy's politics and it was somebody with a
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:05.760]  gun folks tackled him and thank God somebody had a gun there in case they
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:09.320]  needed to take him out and they would have taken him out within seconds if he
[01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:13.320]  hadn't already been tackled but and I know a lot of police are good people I
[01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:17.720]  get your letters I get your emails I get I don't speed as much as I used to but
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:20.960]  I've been pulled over quite a bit by state police and Austin police and I've
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:25.120]  been let off almost in every case and it's probably not even right they're
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:28.600]  doing it they say Alex like to show keep up the good work I know most cops
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:32.560]  aren't bad people but they're trying to train you how to be thugs you're
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:40.520]  Americans too just like the police starting to join people in countries
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.520]  like Greece or in countries like Tunisia or countries like Egypt I mean
[01:28:45.520 --> 01:28:49.600]  countries like Romania just we're not asking to go out on the streets we
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:54.680]  don't want any violence just let's stop doing things that are wrong let's stop
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:58.520]  it I mean I see new articles every day police caught dealing drugs well what
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:01.480]  do you think happened when they made alcohol illegal for 10 years
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:07.720]  alcoholism tripled the organized crime exploded the politicians became
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:11.120]  corrupted the politicians didn't want to get rid of it they were getting payoffs
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.680]  they were getting money it's the same thing here and then the MTV culture and
[01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:19.720]  others promote drugs like they're cool we tell you something young people the
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:24.080]  fact that I want drug decriminalization does not mean that I like drugs drugs
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:29.840]  are destructive you get natural drugs from climbing a mountain or natural
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:33.560]  drugs from winning a touchdown playing touch football with your buddies or
[01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:39.320]  doing good in business or scoring the date with that girl I'm high as a kite
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:43.760]  right now high as a kite and all I've had one cup of coffee I'm high on life

[01:29:56.080 --> 01:30:03.000]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:07.440]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:11.480]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:14.880]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:30:14.880 --> 01:30:19.400]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:23.960]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:28.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.800]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:35.400]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:39.760]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:12.480]  history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:16.440]  underneath the Americans at home I've turned the members influence on our
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:20.640]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:25.920]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:31.000]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:35.360]  bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:39.560]  Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more matches and the
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:43.000]  Congress is saying who do we make the check out to today seems like nobody
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:49.240]  does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic yet

[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:37.280]  before the State of the Union Tuesday they reported on Monday that Gibbs did
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:40.760]  say at the press conference they had the video posted there that yes he'll
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:46.880]  introduce sensible gun control after the Tucson shooting and then he didn't call
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:51.760]  for it people said oh you're wrong see he's not going to do that well and in
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:55.160]  during the campaign he said it was a conspiracy theory we're not going to do
[01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:58.320]  that even though Rahm Emanuel the Chief of Staff gave speeches saying we want to
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:03.200]  put you extra judicially no judge no jury no proof no appeal we put you on a
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:08.040]  no fly list over 2 million Americans now on it now you're on no buy list and I
[01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:14.360]  can't tell you I know a former NFL football player I know a former UT star
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:17.120]  football player I met so many I don't know why for their football players but
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:22.000]  who are also veterans no criminal records who go to buy a gun for their
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:26.240]  grandson of themselves and they're sorry for some reason you can't they just put
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:32.080]  something in their military file well this is the move so they're going to go
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:36.360]  and say oh under mental illness with no proof we're going to say you don't have
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:39.480]  to have a felony now you can't buy a gun we need guns to protect ourselves from
[01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:42.240]  the mentally ill you're not going to stop them from getting guns they're
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:45.280]  going to move to ban assault weapons again and they're announcing they want
[01:36:45.280 --> 01:36:48.200]  you to be able to only buy one gun a week those are the announcements they
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:52.840]  made prior to the announcement that the next week and a half he's going to do
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:56.560]  this but here's news week and I want to get Larry Pratt the head of Gunners of
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:02.720]  America Gunners dot org's take on it White House to push gun control Obama
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.700]  intentionally did not mention gun control in the state of the Union but
[01:37:05.700 --> 01:37:09.200]  they'd say the next two weeks the administration will unveil a campaign to
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.320]  get Congress to toughen existing laws yeah victim disarmament they go on to
[01:37:13.320 --> 01:37:16.320]  say it was intentional according to the White House so that they wouldn't
[01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:20.200]  energize pro-gun groups an administration official says Obama didn't
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:24.400]  mention guns in his speech because of the omnipresent controversy yeah they
[01:37:24.400 --> 01:37:28.600]  know that the polls show it's going our direction liberals are buying guns the
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:32.600]  omnipresent controversy surrounding the Second Amendment and gun control so they
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:35.680]  want to do this by stealth they don't want to make a big deal out of it so we
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:40.760]  can mobilize Larry Pratt tell us from your inside sources on the hill am I
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:43.440]  correct because I'm going off what they were talking about before the shooting
[01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:47.320]  and after what the Justice Department's pushing is that what he's going to be
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:52.800]  unveiling you have your finger on the pulse Alex as usual the I don't think
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:57.760]  that the Congress particularly the House I'm not even sure of the Senate
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.280]  supporting anything to do with gun control with the possible exception of
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:08.280]  trying to expand the already bad law that says if you have a mental health
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:15.400]  diagnosis that that if you're viewed as you could be dangerous to yourself or
[01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:19.920]  others you lose your gun rights no due process at all we tried to get that
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:25.920]  repealed and came close last year so I think we have momentum even there
[01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:30.520]  although that would be the most direct attack that I would expect them to try
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:38.920]  to make barring that Bainer refreshingly said it in the face of Republican
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:43.720]  Peter King's measure to make a congressman a roving thousand foot gun
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:49.280]  free zone said that's not going anywhere and my guess is that the same would be a
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:57.120]  Carolyn McCarthy's ban on magazines that hold more than X number of rounds but
[01:38:57.120 --> 01:39:02.200]  what they will try to do is indicated indicated by what they've already been
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:06.720]  doing administratively unconstitutionally of course even
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:14.400]  illegally but for instance they have banned over 800,000 guns they were Korean
[01:39:14.400 --> 01:39:20.160]  rifles that were to be re-imported into the United States the Korean Army found
[01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:25.000]  them to be surplus already millions of these well at least hundreds of thousands
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:29.400]  guns we give them in the war those wonderful M1s correct that is correct
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:33.640]  it's that M1 carbine and lots of Americans have those things yeah I got
[01:39:33.640 --> 01:39:39.640]  one and it's it yeah it's kind of a fun thing and well no those might fall into
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:44.680]  the wrong hands and you know this standard kind of liberal we don't trust
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:50.360]  the people argument well that at the last minute that deal had its permit
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:55.800]  revoked and boom we're gonna have to wait for a pro-American president I guess
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:59.560]  before we can get that taken care of hopefully the Koreans will wait long
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:03.640]  enough probably no domestic market big enough to handle it except the United
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:06.720]  States and it's not just that they're they're just destroying most of the
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:11.600]  regular helmets jackets clothes that's why most the Army navies have shut down
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:15.080]  the last five years or so because they're doing everything they can just to
[01:40:15.080 --> 01:40:18.720]  keep any of that out of our hands yeah that is exactly right they have a lust
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:22.880]  for destruction in fact that part of this was a problem even somewhat under
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:28.360]  bush where they were destroying ordinance that was surplus or brass that
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:36.280]  223 308 yeah exactly that's why I got an ammo shortage well that in frankly ammo
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.800]  companies have been working 24-7 and the the military has been buying it like
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:48.600]  crazy but whatever the case and that that has eased somewhat I think it was a
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:54.680]  shortage as much as anything inspired by fear of the new president back in 2008
[01:40:54.680 --> 01:41:02.880]  but now you've seen a jump in gun sales in Arizona 63% spike the week
[01:41:02.880 --> 01:41:06.480]  following the shooting of the Congresswoman and we're also seeing a lot
[01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:09.960]  of even Democrats now saying they're packing heat that's good that's the
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:14.720]  proper response and you know have have a security detail they're packing heat
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:19.440]  it's more guns not less guns that's gonna stop drug addict devil worshiping
[01:41:19.440 --> 01:41:25.160]  liberals that's the the way that we have chosen to try to respond to the gun
[01:41:25.160 --> 01:41:29.800]  control arguments oh this shows me more gun control well yeah if that's the case
[01:41:29.800 --> 01:41:35.680]  then why does England have an increasing violent crime problem with guns
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:41.720]  because criminals don't obey the law so we should be emphasizing hey good guys
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:46.840]  there were 40 decent Americans standing around the Congresswoman when this
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:52.800]  shooter boy got loose and started shooting people they have a law in
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:56.840]  Arizona that's like two other states that says if you want to carry a gun in
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:03.000]  your pocket your purse openly on your hip do it don't need anybody's permission
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:09.360]  and yet none of the 40 or so had a gun on them a guy that did carry concealed
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:13.840]  almost was there but had decided the line was long enough he'd go to the
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:17.720]  store and get something come back and that's the guy that came running to the
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:22.040]  sounds of the shots as he was leaving the store he was the only guy that had a
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:29.120]  gun everybody else apparently just didn't well you know the FBI admits
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:35.560]  that for every crime committed with a gun there's so many other crimes that
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:40.920]  are stopped with a gun yeah the FBI data are not quite as good as the survey
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:45.240]  data that have been done by liberals like dr. Gary Cleck at Florida State
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:49.960]  University who find that you're probably talking about four to one crimes
[01:42:49.960 --> 01:42:57.360]  committed with guns a fraction of the number of crimes stopped by guns well I
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:43:01.000]  mean look at simple we got folks with concealed carrier in my office I'm
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:05.840]  packing and it's not it's there just like a telephone's there or just like
[01:43:05.840 --> 01:43:10.000]  a cup of coffee's there I mean it's a tool and I don't sit here living in fear
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:15.160]  yeah I mean you know we advertise the fact that we're not gonna roll over and
[01:43:15.160 --> 01:43:19.840]  so people understand that and that's the way to go I love sergeant Sam here
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:22.960]  locally when you know he's on 590 a.m. he points out he's a former police
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:26.840]  officer he's sitting right there with a fanny pack on you know in the studio and
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:31.520]  you know they're not worried about it but you may have seen it there's a little
[01:43:31.520 --> 01:43:35.920]  joke has been going around on the internet the guys talking to a cop and
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:41.480]  the cop had made a road stop and the guy said well I should tell you I have a
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:46.520]  gun or the cop asked him I'm sorry and he said well yes I have one on me and
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:50.320]  I said well what is it and he described the handgun he said of course I also
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:55.800]  have a rifle there in the back seat and then in the back I've got whatever
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:59.680]  else it was and and the cops said well what are you afraid of and the guy said
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:08.080]  absolutely nothing that's that's the way and I think you're right the numbers
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:13.320]  have been moving in our direction as far as support for firearms freedom
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:20.120]  Americans are more and more aware that like those Democrat congressman Colin
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:23.480]  for goodness sakes there's about as liberal a guy and in some pleasant
[01:44:23.480 --> 01:44:27.960]  the guys you can get and he's come to the conclusion that that he's gonna carry
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:32.240]  a piece well that's I that's the most encouraging thing that I've heard of
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:37.000]  coming out of one of these tragedies and it does help to change the discussion
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:42.120]  that maybe we are gonna have to depend on ourselves but here's what the I think
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:49.160]  the socialist mindset really fears if Americans even liberals start to realize
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:53.440]  it we're we're in it by ourselves where the cops aren't gonna be able to be
[01:44:53.440 --> 01:44:59.400]  there when when trouble strikes once you've made that decision that's so
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:03.920]  central to your existence that you're gonna be responsible for protecting
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:09.040]  yourself against bad guys then I for I don't know if you know Mike Adams but
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:15.440]  he writes columns on the town hall he's a professor yes and he used to be a
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:21.040]  liberal and as he and I were doing an interview on one of my shows I asked him
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:26.240]  you know you got that gun as a liberal when you saw a buddy get murdered
[01:45:26.240 --> 01:45:31.440]  listening to the rest of your story it's obvious to me that that was the opening
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:36.280]  door to the rest of a change of philosophy didn't have an all at once but
[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:40.840]  once you made that critical decision in such a critical area of your life you
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:44.760]  began to see that you had to be responsible self-responsible exactly but
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:48.200]  I don't even call them liberals I call them domesticated I've told the story
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:52.600]  about many years ago I kept in college I kept my guns at my parents house and I
[01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:56.080]  was gonna go to the shooting range they had a major newspaper editor that's an
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:46:00.920]  old family friend down from Dallas and they were in there having lunch and he
[01:46:00.920 --> 01:46:04.840]  saw me walk out of my parents bedroom where the gun safe set or out of the
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:09.440]  bedroom closet walking through the front room and he saw me with a rifle in a
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:13.920]  you know in a case and in a in a sidearm and he got scared like it was a
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:18.160]  demon or a hundred foot cobra with red eyes and he got so scared and I said
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:21.360]  look it's unloaded it's no big deal and he was so scared to death but if you
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:26.040]  could ever get him to go out load it learn safety shoot it boom they're sold
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:30.480]  you get somebody and I've done this with liberals with with domesticated
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:35.560]  castrated people they literally grow their way those back as soon as they
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:40.120]  fired the weapon and and and when we had a culture of pure guns there was much
[01:46:40.120 --> 01:46:44.160]  less crime total safety but if you did do something unsafe with a gun people
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:48.120]  would ostracize you and you know I was trained that way but but shifting gears
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:53.000]  here Larry I mean you all I mean you don't like to play up these threats you
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.640]  like to you'll sensibly look at it but look they're announcing a flutilla of
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:47:02.120]  gun laws hey what have you heard those are gonna be briefly and then be they
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:06.520]  prime the pump that oh it's the fault of the guns that this is happening right
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:10.720]  and what if there's another big event another big shooting and those let and
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:15.760]  that legislation's introduced I think this is a grave danger well that is the
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:22.400]  one thing that maybe could get somebody like Boehner to go wobbly if indeed
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:28.560]  there were some way for the left to continue the tirade against guns but
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:34.560]  right now it's not working in fact there the I just heard somebody refer to the
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:42.600]  left-wing libelers of Palin and the right and all as a Taliban doing a an
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:50.200]  internet an electronic stoning and that that didn't work this time that folks
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:54.520]  didn't buy their message and so if they're not buying the message that it
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:59.520]  was that the freedom fighters in the country's fault for having put a target
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:05.040]  on Gabriel Giffords district well then they're they're probably not going to
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:09.960]  support a move for gun control so as long as we can hold tight in the polls I
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:15.560]  think the congressman will probably be okay but what they will need to do is to
[01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:19.680]  hear from people and I would urge folks to go to gun owners org make sure you're
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:24.680]  getting our legislative bulletins because when something even however a
[01:48:24.680 --> 01:48:28.440]  little a chance starts moving we're gonna be right on top of it we'll send out a
[01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:31.360]  bulletin and embedded in there will be an email that you can send to the
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:35.520]  appropriate congress critter to say what you like or don't like about whatever
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:41.240]  sure that is so the the numbers game is still going to count they need to know
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:46.560]  that people in their districts are of the of the right opinion and that will
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:51.480]  help hold them in place in closing Larry Pratt what do you make of their
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:55.680]  admission that he didn't want to talk about it openly in the speech so that
[01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:59.840]  they wouldn't energize the pro-second amendment lobby that is the majority of
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:03.400]  the American people I mean that shows that they're doing something they know
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:09.240]  is unpopular right there it shows their scallywags and as long as they can do as
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:14.160]  much damage as they have been doing through the BATF why take us on an
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:18.080]  open combat when they're doing pretty well cutting our throat from behind well
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:22.600]  that was my next point what about the ATF just ordering from California to Texas
[01:49:22.600 --> 01:49:28.120]  ordering gun shops to call them when they sell more than one gun I mean now
[01:49:28.120 --> 01:49:31.600]  they're doing now they're just like mafia thugs that just tell you what to do
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:35.880]  with no law behind them right I am hopeful that and I realized Darrell
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:41.320]  Issa representative over the oversight committees that's going to be looking
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:46.600]  into all this corruption in the Obama regime he's got a long list of things
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:50.800]  that need to be attended to the health care waivers of their buddies all kinds
[01:49:50.800 --> 01:49:56.080]  of stuff I mean it's so incredibly long a list and we've been urging and
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:59.160]  representative Paul Brown who's the head of the Second Amendment caucus has been
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:04.200]  urging Issa look we know how long the list is but would you please put the BATF
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:11.120]  on top these guys are actually a danger even to the decent agents who are in the
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:16.920]  ATF one of them had infiltrated the Hells Angels and had his cover blown his
[01:50:16.920 --> 01:50:21.000]  home was burned down with his wife and children and happily they got out but
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:26.840]  this guy's life is in danger because the higher-ups are not only our goofballs
[01:50:26.840 --> 01:50:31.600]  but they really have no desire to do anything by the book there are two
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:36.600]  agents want to be whistleblowers because of what they saw of the BATF agents
[01:50:36.600 --> 01:50:39.880]  themselves running guns into Mexico to run the numbers up well Larry Pratt thank
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:43.320]  you so much it goes back to the ATF being founded out of the Revenuers who
[01:50:43.320 --> 01:50:47.000]  were the whiskey police who were so corrupt abolished the ATF you agree with

[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:10.760]  look at the economy all the evidence of a continuing to deteriorate as the central
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:17.560]  bankers have planned the imminent fall of Egypt it's I'd say 6040 right now that
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:21.320]  it's gonna fall 60 that it will fall the people who knows we'll come out of that
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:24.840]  Bob Chapman with us for the full hour the last 30 minutes Lindsey Williams to
[01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:28.480]  be with him got a call from Lindsey Williams saying he's got breaking info
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:32.720]  dealing with the Suez Canal a lot more so that is coming up I wanted to just
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:36.360]  briefly in this short segment bring Ted Anderson up because if you look at the
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:40.720]  10-year graph on gold the two-year graph the year graph it's going straight up
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:45.240]  it's silver just a year ago was 20 bucks an ounce and it's gone up to 30 and they
[01:54:45.240 --> 01:54:49.200]  do manipulation whenever the contracts are coming up and then it just bounces
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:51.760]  like a beach ball that you're trying to push under the bottom of the pool and
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:56.520]  Ted's smart other gold brokers and people when the market gets soft they
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:00.520]  back off Ted rushes in and buys and then he's able to give you the lower price
[01:55:00.520 --> 01:55:05.320]  silver and gold until he runs out of it at the price when it went down as it goes
[01:55:05.320 --> 01:55:09.880]  up but if you look at the graph when it goes up and down overall it's only going
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:14.080]  up you look at the long-term curve on gold effect let's show people watching
[01:55:14.080 --> 01:55:18.200]  prison planet dot TV and I was listening to radio the 10-year graft on gold to
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:23.480]  just just put in 10-year graph on gold and it's parabolic it's parabolic so
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:27.080]  there's these little bumps but on its way up and that's because of currency
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:30.200]  devaluation that's why commodities are going up that's triggering the riots the
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:35.280]  starving all over the world and and the people going bankrupt Ted briefly
[01:55:35.280 --> 01:55:39.200]  getting into the economy and today's special gold and silver offer you can

[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:27.640]  Alex Jones okay Bob Chapman with US intelligence the biggest private
[02:00:27.640 --> 02:00:32.440]  silver and gold broker in history biggest financial newsletter then retired
[02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:36.640]  came back routine analyst here every Friday I was not here for the full show
[02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:42.040]  Friday so he wasn't here last Friday but he's here with us today for the full
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:46.240]  hour Lindsay Williams popping in the last 30 minutes to give us his take and his
[02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:51.080]  intel on the situation in Egypt Tunisia Yemen and spreading to other areas
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:56.080]  Greece Ireland riots all over the world to the banker occupation I keep meaning
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:00.400]  to salute everyone on the V for victory campaign we've launched it goes back to
[02:01:00.400 --> 02:01:05.000]  the archers 700 years ago you're pulling back their bows so the Norman would
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:10.680]  cut the Anglo-Saxons index and middle finger off so they couldn't ever be
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:15.320]  released and get their longbows again and fight back so there's so when they
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:19.560]  were fighting the Norman they would show them their two fingers that's where the
[02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:24.080]  V for victory comes from we also use it from French and resistance and that
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:27.160]  that campaign if you looked at Google Analytics one of the hottest searches
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:30.960]  without us even really pushing it is that in the last week posters going up
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:37.360]  everywhere but what we need is not just people making videos of the V symbol
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:42.400]  that's great or the answer to 1984 1776 contest exposing the homeland's
[02:01:42.400 --> 02:01:46.960]  security takeover that's separate we need people to get the V symbols in all
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:51.640]  legal places but banner hangs whatever you can to get local media to cover it
[02:01:51.640 --> 02:01:55.880]  that's when it really goes viral because then the media always tries to attack it
[02:01:55.880 --> 02:01:59.560]  that blows up in their face let's see that happen this weekend I'm gonna talk
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:02.880]  more about that before the broadcast ends but so much going on with the economy
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:07.800]  so much happening in Egypt right now they've cut off the internet the last
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:12.600]  two hours the police before they did it were joining in the rebellion now they've
[02:02:12.600 --> 02:02:15.560]  called the military out they're reportedly machine gunning people on the
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:21.960]  streets explosions fires all over Cairo and Alexandria Egypt spreading all
[02:02:21.960 --> 02:02:27.240]  over the Middle East right now Bob Chapman where do you see this going
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:35.760]  nowhere good but you know we have financed 12 billion dollars a year to
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:42.520]  Egypt second largest recipient of foreign aid and the man's been a
[02:02:42.520 --> 02:02:53.280]  dictator for 20 years or however however long it's been in there 29 and and you
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:02:58.240]  know things come to an end I think that the influence of the United States
[02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:06.000]  could be hurt in the Middle East in Tunisia they had another quote strong
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:12.200]  man so to speak and he fled his wife didn't forget to take the ton and a
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:20.400]  half of gold with her and and so it's upside down with Yemen and maybe Saudi
[02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:25.520]  Arabia's next that's right every time they flee it's gold that they carry
[02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:32.000]  with them hmm very very interesting and you know somebody you've made a
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:38.680]  comment why would they take that they can't eat it and you know it's the same
[02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:46.120]  old redundant stupidities and they can buy anything they need with it well
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:53.400]  that's right it's idiotic that we know that and the dictators know that too but
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:04:00.040]  there's a great deal of turmoil I mean the the situation is so fluid it's
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:05.600]  changing every minute at least in Egypt I don't know what they're doing in
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:10.080]  Tunisia right now if Egypt falls to the population that's gonna supercharge it
[02:04:10.080 --> 02:04:17.480]  everywhere else oh I think so it's a very populated country and people get
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:24.920]  sick and tired of being repressed prices go up they can't afford to eat and this
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:34.520]  great squalor in the country it's like so many other African countries and it's
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:39.600]  it's gonna be a battle for a long time Bob stay there we got to break it down when
[02:04:39.600 --> 02:04:43.320]  they come back I want to go over it all with you other areas the economy the
[02:04:43.320 --> 02:04:47.800]  Davos announcement they want 100 trillion the bankers want 100 trillion extra
[02:04:47.800 --> 02:04:52.320]  how much can they leverage that what does that mean 100 trillion more of your
[02:04:52.320 --> 02:04:56.360]  tax money Bob Chapman the international forecaster comms our guests I'm Alex

[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:13.160]  work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers and government
[02:05:13.160 --> 02:05:16.880]  employees but for the rest of us things seemed to be getting worse gold and

[02:08:00.640 --> 02:08:08.920]  he's the T-Rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:08:09.320 --> 02:08:12.680]  all right Bob the Chattanooga for the rest of the hour the international
[02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:17.920]  forecaster great financial geopolitical analyst riding shotgun with us Lindsey
[02:08:17.920 --> 02:08:21.280]  Williams called us this morning said he's got a lot of key information and he did
[02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:25.200]  call it from his two oil company exec sources now one of them died of cancer
[02:08:25.200 --> 02:08:28.920]  that looked for the Middle East to have massive turmoil but then look to China
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:33.840]  that oil prices would be going up and they magically started going up and
[02:08:33.840 --> 02:08:37.400]  that all this was going to be unfolding but but Bob Chapman the first thing I
[02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:41.080]  want to get into before we get into the latest developments with Egypt there's
[02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:43.560]  been some big new birth certificate developments I'm gonna hit with you as
[02:08:43.560 --> 02:08:49.000]  well and that's that we see numbers of 1.5 quadrillion that economists
[02:08:49.000 --> 02:08:52.840]  Tarpley and others bring up Washington Post says 600 trillion is what the
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:56.840]  derivatives are the bankers have bought off Western governments to claim that we
[02:08:56.840 --> 02:09:02.080]  owe this money when it's their debt not owed by us correct me if I'm wrong but
[02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:06.520]  if we cut all entitlements worldwide it wouldn't even pay for a few percentage
[02:09:06.520 --> 02:09:10.640]  points of the 1.5 quadrillion but if we can put this on screen I didn't
[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:14.160]  warn the guys we can try to pull it up London Telegraph Associated Press
[02:09:14.160 --> 02:09:21.720]  Davos calls for 100 trillion in new credit Sarkozy calls for 100 trillion
[02:09:21.720 --> 02:09:26.000]  and then under fractional reserve banking they can loan out 10 times that so
[02:09:26.000 --> 02:09:30.200]  that's a thousand trillion or one quadrillion and Soros is making more
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:34.720]  statements like I'm having a great crisis like he made last year at Davos
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:38.840]  there's the headline world needs a hundred trillion more credit says world
[02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:42.560]  economic forum and what they mean is give them the money back by our tax
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:47.280]  dollars and then they loan it back to credit card holders at 25 30% interest to
[02:09:47.280 --> 02:09:52.920]  governments at 10 20 30% to corporations I mean this is crazy they create
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:56.840]  the crisis offer the solution give them more power and it's even admitted
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:01.440]  mainstream news that the dollar devaluing driving up commodities mainly
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:05.240]  food upwards of half of the Egyptians and these other Middle Eastern countries
[02:10:05.240 --> 02:10:10.000]  being on the equivalent of food stamps the average is about half of Egyptians
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:13.000]  make two dollars or less they're starving you look at these rioters
[02:10:13.000 --> 02:10:17.640]  I mean they look like concentration camp victims not not one of them is
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:22.080]  fat like a lot of Americans are myself a little overweight I mean and the media
[02:10:22.080 --> 02:10:26.680]  spinning it oh they're Muslim radicals on Fox News and CNN are they Muslim
[02:10:26.680 --> 02:10:35.440]  radicals doing it in Dublin Ireland or in areas of Greece like Athens no it's
[02:10:35.440 --> 02:10:42.400]  the same problem so break down this demand for 100 trillion more and then
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:47.080]  how much they're gonna leverage that well they've been working on that plan
[02:10:47.080 --> 02:10:52.120]  for several months and most people don't know about it and the plan is for the
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:57.520]  whole world and that would be about ten trillion dollars a year and they're just
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:03.200]  going to continue they think to inject this money into the world system to keep
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:09.000]  it from collapsing and of course during that period of time all of the
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:13.480]  currencies can continue to divide you against one another but more importantly
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:19.440]  against gold and silver that average has been on goal 17 18 percent for 11
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:25.120]  years and 20 to 21 percent on silver but that's what they intend to do it just
[02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:31.680]  like last May when I called here on the program for QE 2 and QE 3 everybody was
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:35.280]  going I don't think so well it turned out that way and I think we're going to get
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:41.720]  number three and that's part of number three and I got interrupt you said that
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:45.560]  two weeks ago here it's on record and in your newsletter but explain what QE 2
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:51.640]  QE 3 SDR is for those that don't know well quantitative easing it's another
[02:11:51.640 --> 02:11:59.120]  euphemism for explaining the creation of money and credit out of thin air the
[02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:08.240]  IMF issues SDRs special drawing rights they are not backed by anything it's
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:14.680]  just another phony baloney currency and it's not used very widely they try to
[02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:22.160]  implement 1967-68 it was a disaster in fact gold ran up for the first time in
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:27.280]  that time period and the government illegally came in and squashed it as they
[02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:32.520]  found out years later I didn't know it at the time but they want to continue to
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:37.840]  liquefy and when you liquefy and throw money at the problem you just get more
[02:12:37.840 --> 02:12:42.360]  inflation eventually it leads to hyperinflation and then a collapse and
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:46.600]  deflationary depression and that's what they want worldwide and they think out
[02:12:46.600 --> 02:12:49.840]  of this mess that they've created they're going to be able to force us to
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:53.000]  accept world government and it's not going to happen well that's the plan
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:56.880]  they've engineered the crisis on record we have the IMF World Bank documents they
[02:12:56.880 --> 02:13:02.160]  think they're going to finagle a global police state out of the unrest food
[02:13:02.160 --> 02:13:06.760]  prices go up in the US it hurts food prices go up in Egypt people start
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:10.000]  starving the death and you can't just call them Muslim extremists they're so
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:13.960]  desperate with their kids starving at home they're lighting themselves on fire
[02:13:13.960 --> 02:13:19.480]  and no doubt this is already sending oil and gold and food and other commodities
[02:13:19.480 --> 02:13:24.840]  up the unrest if Egypt falls and they've the as of two hours ago the police are
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:29.760]  now joining the crowds in Alexandria and the other major cities like Cairo and
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:32.840]  you've got hundreds of millions of people now starting to get involved in
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:36.280]  this they called out the military they're just mowing people down now that
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:39.000]  started right as they cut the internet off over there showing how fast
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:42.720]  governments can do this headline Egypt's internet kill switch coming to
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:47.840]  America in full wars dot com by Steve Watson I mean this is really shades of
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:51.480]  things to come I don't think it'll be as intensified or as extreme here in the
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:55.480]  West but and we're already seeing it in many areas of Europe where do you see
[02:13:55.480 --> 02:13:58.920]  this going what's your time frame with this flaring up and what happens if
[02:13:58.920 --> 02:14:03.320]  Egypt does fall to their population won't that supercharge rebellions
[02:14:03.320 --> 02:14:08.040]  worldwide well it certainly will in Saudi Arabia which is right next to Egypt
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:14.240]  and Libya I don't know I don't think so but then you go north to Jordan
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:21.240]  Jordan's a very pro-british American state with another dummy running it
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:26.240]  and I wouldn't be surprised if it didn't spread there as well and so we're
[02:14:26.240 --> 02:14:32.440]  looking at changes and I you know from what I've gleaned thus far this is not
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:37.040]  some radical movement these people are hungry and I think it's as simple as that
[02:14:37.040 --> 02:14:42.280]  empty stomachs make for rebellion certainly did 99 would look how many
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:46.800]  years have we talked about Chuchescu my film Obama deception fall the Republic
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:51.000]  Obama deception made almost two years ago folks get it because it's more
[02:14:51.000 --> 02:14:55.480]  powerful now people see it they go how did all these guests and an economist
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:15:00.720]  and sociologist that Alex interviewed how did they predict this because we
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:06.080]  know what dollar devaluation when it's the World Reserve currency does we know
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:09.040]  what the Defense Department and Ministry of Defense in England have been
[02:15:09.040 --> 02:15:13.840]  gearing up for they believe they're going to bring in this crisis and write it
[02:15:13.840 --> 02:15:19.160]  to Valhalla I think they're writing it right over the edge of a cliff but I
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:22.520]  mean Bob you didn't say this two weeks ago you've been saying it every week
[02:15:22.520 --> 02:15:26.560]  for years and years and years probably seven eight years on this show that we
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:31.480]  were coming towards this I had you know economists like George Humphrey here when
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:34.880]  they got rid of Glass-Steagall I had you on then saying the same thing I mean we
[02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:38.880]  know it's like you shoot somebody in the head with a 45 you know it's gonna
[02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:42.360]  probably kill them I mean it's not like we're rocket scientists to know what's
[02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:49.120]  happening and it's it's just so amazing to see this turmoil accelerating well
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:57.640]  I think your commentary is excellent and the reason why is it's all there for
[02:15:57.640 --> 02:16:03.760]  anybody to read in almost the same way history repeats itself because it's the
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:08.320]  same group gang of criminals that are doing the same thing over and over and
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:12.480]  over again and most people don't catch on because they're not educated or
[02:16:12.480 --> 02:16:18.560]  ill-educated and even people within the professional ranks and many of them
[02:16:18.560 --> 02:16:23.880]  can't argue because if they do they lose their jobs like economists for major
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:28.760]  corporations etc are analysts so they got to keep their mouth shut it's only
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:32.840]  people like you and I in a handful of others get up there and say no no the
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:40.600]  dog is white not black come on get with it well we're watching a live stream
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:45.280]  feed they've shut the internet off in the country but Al Jazeera's got a
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:50.080]  satellite connection and we see the police live fleeing and being routed
[02:16:50.080 --> 02:16:57.520]  and the feed just cut by the Egyptian people and again the reports are they've
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:01.560]  got the military now firing on everybody I don't know they say that's a lot of
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:04.720]  stream but I don't know how it could be because it's dark there now sorry Bob go
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:09.880]  ahead you know Alex Alex that's gonna end very badly because the military can
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:17.320]  in no way control those people I mean there's millions of them you know they
[02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:21.400]  throw enough rocks you're gonna knock the guy down whether he's got a helmet
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:26.480]  and a vest on and then you take his weapon and then then things really get
[02:17:26.480 --> 02:17:33.160]  hot and I think that's gonna happen now this thing is full-blown well right now
[02:17:33.160 --> 02:17:37.840]  we're watching footage of just the police completely being rounded and
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:42.200]  fleeing and they're repeating the footage so this was obviously had to be
[02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:47.840]  earlier even about zero says live but just absolutely incredible and they've
[02:17:47.840 --> 02:17:52.640]  called the military out I guess it rests on the military a are they gonna be
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:58.760]  able to suppress the people B will they join the people C will the military
[02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:03.800]  side with the dictator but then be defeated well I think they've already
[02:18:03.800 --> 02:18:09.720]  sided with the dictator who's like giriating in London and I think they're
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:14.040]  gonna lose yeah what does that say so that's confirmed that he has fled it is
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:19.000]  confirmed that housing bombard goodfully yesterday no I've read that in several
[02:18:19.000 --> 02:18:25.160]  reports yeah well well and you know usually when that happens they don't go
[02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:29.520]  back guys let's double check on that lose let's double check as the media is
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:33.960]  reporting he fled to London but let's search housing bombard in London let's
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:41.360]  let's see if we can absolutely nail that down he's hiding out we know that so in
[02:18:41.360 --> 02:18:45.560]  your gut do you think Egypt's gonna fall well I think they're gonna have a
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:49.400]  change of government and I think it's healthy and I don't think it's being
[02:18:49.400 --> 02:18:53.960]  run by extremists these people are hungry and the same thing happened in
[02:18:53.960 --> 02:18:59.880]  Tunisia I've been in all these countries and you know the poverty is
[02:18:59.880 --> 02:19:07.160]  terrible I mean that includes in Morocco and Algeria and and you know you go
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:15.240]  south it's just as bad Nigeria I mean it's one big bingey ditch those are the
[02:19:15.240 --> 02:19:22.080]  ditches that run along the streets where people relieve themselves and there's
[02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:29.360]  some things Americans just don't know go on in this world we've got several
[02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:34.320]  publications we've been putting up on screen the big Israeli newspapers
[02:19:34.320 --> 02:19:37.760]  Israeli national news is reporting that Mubarak's wife and son have fled to
[02:19:37.760 --> 02:19:43.000]  London amid protest we've got other reports that he's fled as well and yeah
[02:19:43.000 --> 02:19:46.360]  if he's fled that's pretty much a shoe in that it's gonna be a change in
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:50.480]  government the question is what will it be we're gonna ask Bob if he thinks
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:54.280]  there's any way this could be Western intelligence behind this is some people
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:19:59.160]  are saying Wayne Madsen concurred with us and thinks this is organic due to food
[02:19:59.160 --> 02:20:04.280]  prices hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now

[02:24:19.960 --> 02:24:25.680]  class is here in the United States that they would chastise senators for calling
[02:24:25.680 --> 02:24:30.200]  who gen tall a dictator two weeks ago we can have a go that Joe Biden the vice
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:34.800]  president would say that in press releases and statements that housing
[02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:39.720]  the barracks on a dictator here's CBS news we've also got the examiner
[02:24:39.720 --> 02:24:43.600]  reporting on this housing the barracks not been seen in two days it's confirmed
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:49.280]  that four days ago his wife and son fled it says the son was his successor to be
[02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:54.760]  the leader just like North Korea I mean they're not just dictators their kids
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:58.840]  become dictators why not put a gold crown on these people and our filthy
[02:24:58.840 --> 02:25:02.920]  government 12 plus million on record a year second biggest recipient of aid
[02:25:02.920 --> 02:25:06.920]  props them up in the world I've got the headlines I read them earlier saying why
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:11.720]  are you propping up dictators this is why the Muslims are mad at us we fund
[02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:18.040]  dictators in their country that torture people to death okay it's wrong and Bob
[02:25:18.040 --> 02:25:21.840]  Chapman you know if the Republicans don't deliver on reversing the New
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:27.480]  World Order there's gonna be serious resistance here in this country people
[02:25:27.480 --> 02:25:33.520]  are figuring out this two-party political class dictatorship as well well I
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:37.360]  think you're right and there are some that we know will try to make changes
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:44.440]  can we get enough I don't know if I had to guess I'd say no we didn't gain
[02:25:44.440 --> 02:25:51.040]  enough 14% instead of 6% we would have liked to have gotten 50% of the
[02:25:51.040 --> 02:25:56.560]  incumbents kicked out the American public generally speaking hasn't gotten it
[02:25:56.560 --> 02:26:02.160]  yet yes we're changing hearts and minds all over the world but we got to do it
[02:26:02.160 --> 02:26:06.960]  faster well look at Rahm Emanuel there's no doubt that that guy wouldn't win if
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:10.800]  they didn't have classic famous election fraud you know even with Kennedy in
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:14.960]  Chicago and now the Supreme Court said yeah you can go ahead and be on the
[02:26:14.960 --> 02:26:19.920]  ballot and you know they're putting their mafia people in everywhere they're
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:27.080]  organized crime leaders but I mean again it's just so arrogant they have
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:30.920]  gotten to the point where they don't think anybody's gonna do about do
[02:26:30.920 --> 02:26:35.400]  anything about it and if there's any indication what we're seeing worldwide
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:41.400]  the next step will be and for some event and we don't know what the event will be
[02:26:41.400 --> 02:26:46.920]  yet it's gonna happen and for the strangest set of circumstances people are
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:51.320]  gonna start demonstrating and these goons who run around and these dark
[02:26:51.320 --> 02:26:58.440]  uniforms with their m16s they are in turn going to start beating people around
[02:26:58.440 --> 02:27:02.280]  and that'll do it have you heard the latest out have you heard the latest
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:07.520]  they're doing warrantless checkpoints this is confirmed in Atlanta and police
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:15.000]  are actually doing cavity searches now that's unbelievable let me ask you this
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:19.320]  you know you know in other countries of the world they do have checkpoints I
[02:27:19.320 --> 02:27:23.960]  mean you take Mexico as an example they have them but no one's feeling you up
[02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:28.160]  you know they just check your car and to go through it that's the end of it let
[02:27:28.160 --> 02:27:30.600]  me briefly bring this out we're gonna come back briefly get into the birth
[02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:34.520]  certificate and then we're gonna have Lindsay Williams on with you this week
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:41.440]  we got in the mail to our address addressed to Alex Jones rom for mayor
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:47.520]  and it came to our address with a letter thanking me for my support I've not
[02:27:47.520 --> 02:27:52.320]  been supportive of Rahm Emanuel the gun grabbing creature the ear gun you know
[02:27:52.320 --> 02:27:58.040]  you know son of terrorist this is a guy famous for mailing dead fish to people
[02:27:58.040 --> 02:28:03.440]  as a threat and and threatening people do you think this is a joke from inside
[02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:06.560]  his campaign or some type of veiled threat or a twink of the nose saying
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:12.080]  doesn't matter what you do we've got the election fixed it could be any of the
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:19.600]  above I don't know how to read that one because you've named the distinct
[02:28:19.600 --> 02:28:25.720]  possibilities and of course you're a general target anyway and so you get
[02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:33.920]  that kind of thing but Emanuel is at the bottom of the barrel you know the guy
[02:28:33.920 --> 02:28:40.320]  is despicable and they'll probably steal the election and that's the arrogance
[02:28:40.320 --> 02:28:48.960]  that you referred to within society it it's not only in Washington it's in a
[02:28:48.960 --> 02:28:56.760]  state politics state business and you know look look at Texas they told him
[02:28:56.760 --> 02:29:01.680]  not to build the roads are gonna try to build them anyway they don't care it all
[02:29:01.680 --> 02:29:05.640]  depends on how much money they get paid they don't look at the end result they
[02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:12.320]  don't look down the road and see they grandchildren and slaves here in Texas in
[02:29:12.320 --> 02:29:16.920]  the legislature we voted down turning 8,000 miles of roads into toll roads but
[02:29:16.920 --> 02:29:20.560]  every time we beat them they just come back and push them again I mean it's
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:28.720]  it's just it's completely naked tyranny political zombieism yeah they just

[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:48.200]  into the history channel secret society special that was very well done but
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:53.600]  overall a whitewash and I'll have to comment on that Sunday just because we
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:58.880]  don't have time to get into it now but they treated me pretty well in it and
[02:33:58.880 --> 02:34:03.360]  tried to show both sides but overall it was quite a whitewash so we're going to
[02:34:03.360 --> 02:34:06.080]  be discussing that but it was incredible to see that on national
[02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:10.440]  television dealing with a bohemian grove if you want to really see the truth
[02:34:10.440 --> 02:34:14.600]  about bohemian grove the film it's two films on one DVD dark secrets inside

[02:34:22.800 --> 02:34:27.840]  it available at info wars.com Bob Chapman of course is our guest briefly
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:32.120]  Hawaiian governor Abercrombie's health director quits CBS news interim health
[02:34:32.120 --> 02:34:37.040]  director dr. Neil Palafax abruptly quit Wednesday the first of the new governor
[02:34:37.040 --> 02:34:41.520]  Abercrombie's cabinet appointees to leave and Bill introduced in a white state
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:46.360]  legislature will allow anyone to get a copy of Obama's birth records for $100
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:51.120]  and we had the good longtime friend of the governor when he was a congressman a
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:54.480]  big reporter come out and say oh I talked to him it's all true they can't find
[02:34:54.480 --> 02:34:57.800]  the certificate which the governor already told the newspaper a week and a
[02:34:57.800 --> 02:35:04.400]  half ago and now they are freaking out I mean there's something going on
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:09.240]  briefly I want to get separately Lindsey Williams take on this then we'll get
[02:35:09.240 --> 02:35:12.600]  back into the world economy in the Middle East that Lindsey Williams oil
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:16.240]  exec friends told him look for in the next few months and here we are major
[02:35:16.240 --> 02:35:20.160]  unrest he was right which points towards it being an operation of some type maybe
[02:35:20.160 --> 02:35:23.320]  they knew their policies would cause this of dollar devaluation increasing
[02:35:23.320 --> 02:35:29.000]  food prices and energy prices but what's briefly your take on this whole birth
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:34.440]  certificate situation Bob Chapman well I think they made a mistake they said
[02:35:34.440 --> 02:35:38.160]  they had the certificate and they didn't it probably doesn't exist they probably
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:41.800]  figured they could bluff their way through it and they couldn't I think the
[02:35:41.800 --> 02:35:52.920]  big question is now or after the the Obama administration if it is found that
[02:35:52.920 --> 02:35:59.520]  he is in fact an illegal alien are they going to be able to nullify all those
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:06.000]  the things he's done since he's been in the White House let's get one see
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:10.960]  Williams pastor Williams of course 30 years ago worked with the heads of
[02:36:10.960 --> 02:36:14.800]  several major oil companies as their official chat when in the board meetings
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:19.120]  and exposed with his best seller the energy non-crisis book that they have
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:26.280]  more oil than Saudi Arabia on tap in just several fields in Alaska and then
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:30.120]  over the years we've now been able to release the oil exec the head of
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:33.800]  operations for Atlantic Richfield the other one who's an actual CEO of another
[02:36:33.800 --> 02:36:39.640]  big company we haven't released his name but the other fellow of course was a
[02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:44.480]  Mr. Fromm died in December of cancer and told Lindsay what was going to be
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:48.120]  coming up in the future the in everything that's now happening the other
[02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:51.680]  oil exec mirroring what he's told him Lindsay if you want to comment on the
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:55.400]  birth certificate that's fine but in limited time you called it here three
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:37:00.560]  months ago and then again a month ago you said the Middle East the crisis is
[02:37:00.560 --> 02:37:04.360]  on over there look for the Suez Canal to get shut down I remember you saying
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:09.240]  that from your sources then you said look to China after that you talked about
[02:37:09.240 --> 02:37:14.040]  oil said the next six months we've got 150 then after that maybe even 200 we'll
[02:37:14.040 --> 02:37:17.920]  get Bob's take on this as well but from everything you've been told you say it
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:22.560]  ties into that from your sources break it down for us when I woke up this
[02:37:22.560 --> 02:37:28.360]  morning and heard the crisis in Egypt and then it is spread to Jordan and
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:34.920]  Yemen my mind went right back to what had been predicted on your program four
[02:37:34.920 --> 02:37:39.560]  months ago I had been told by the elitists of the world and prior to Mr.
[02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:44.840]  Fromm's passing away he had told me that they were going to have a crisis all
[02:37:44.840 --> 02:37:51.120]  wanted a crisis in the Middle East and here we are exactly Alex four months
[02:37:51.120 --> 02:37:55.680]  later just as this gentleman told me with the crisis now developing the
[02:37:55.680 --> 02:38:00.640]  Egypt and Jordan and Yemen and the Suez Canal 30% of the world's oil travels
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:05.480]  through that canal on any given day if this builds over into the Suez we will
[02:38:05.480 --> 02:38:10.400]  have four to five dollar gallon gasoline at the gas pump overnight and Alex
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:15.160]  every bit of this and I say this by the providence of God because it's no way in
[02:38:15.160 --> 02:38:19.400]  the world that I as a little ordinary everyday guy could have ever known any
[02:38:19.400 --> 02:38:23.400]  of this had it not been told me by the elitists of the world and of course by
[02:38:23.400 --> 02:38:28.080]  Mr. Fromm before he passed away and Bob Chapman I'm so glad you're on the
[02:38:28.080 --> 02:38:33.600]  program today because I remember so well back two and a half years ago it was on
[02:38:33.600 --> 02:38:39.240]  the Friday just like this and you and I were on Alex program together and I had
[02:38:39.240 --> 02:38:44.600]  warned Alex that I had something so bizarre that it would shake the world
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:49.960]  and he allowed me and I risked my reputation and came on the program and
[02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:53.560]  you were right there Bob and remarked about it and I said I've just been told
[02:38:53.560 --> 02:38:57.840]  by the elitist friend now we know who his name is which again from and I said
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:03.360]  he just told me that the price of crude oil is going from $147 a barrel to $50
[02:39:03.360 --> 02:39:08.240]  a barrel and I remember Bob that you remarked my goodness I don't know how
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:13.000]  this can possibly happen and I wondered myself if I wasn't crazy but I said it
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:19.480]  and exactly three months later Alex just as this gentleman had told me Mr.
[02:39:19.480 --> 02:39:25.520]  Fromm it took place in fact it went to $34 a barrel and he said at the same time
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:31.800]  he said the price of crude oil is going to stay between $50 and $70 a barrel for
[02:39:31.800 --> 02:39:37.320]  two and one-half years now Alex I got to go back to this because of the fact
[02:39:37.320 --> 02:39:41.160]  that if everything he said this comment has happened in the past has
[02:39:41.160 --> 02:39:44.800]  happened then everything he says is going to happen in the future is going to
[02:39:44.800 --> 02:39:48.560]  happen too and I'm going to enumerate all of them for you as fast as I can
[02:39:48.560 --> 02:39:53.960]  possibly talk it here and he said two and one-half years crude oil will stay
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:40:00.000]  there and it did Alex almost to the month two and a half years crude oil has
[02:40:00.000 --> 02:40:04.040]  stayed where he said it was going to stay and then I came on your program a
[02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:10.080]  few weeks ago and I said it's ever the price of crude oil is going back up to
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:16.480]  $150 to $200 a barrel folks mark my words I was told by Mr. Fromm before he
[02:40:16.480 --> 02:40:20.800]  passed away where it was going you are going to see it go back there if this
[02:40:20.800 --> 02:40:26.280]  Suez canal has a conflict in relation if this builds over from Egypt to the Suez
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:32.120]  canal we could see that four to five dollar gallon gasoline basically overnight
[02:40:32.120 --> 02:40:36.160]  but there's more to it than this because not only did he say two and a half
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:43.240]  years but Alex four months ago I was told by the elite that there is going to be
[02:40:43.240 --> 02:40:48.520]  a crisis in the Middle East he did not say a war with Iran and you remember my
[02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:53.720]  exact words in fact I punctuated them because I had to say it just like they
[02:40:53.720 --> 02:40:57.600]  said it there is going to be a crisis in the Middle East and I've been sitting
[02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:02.040]  back wondering every day when it would pop up and where it would start and I
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:06.480]  woke up this morning and heard that it had happened in Egypt and Jordan is
[02:41:06.480 --> 02:41:11.640]  building over in the Yemen that Mubarak son had fled the country of Egypt and
[02:41:11.640 --> 02:41:16.840]  Alex it was exactly like this man said he was going to happen it is back and
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:20.440]  happened okay now let's go back though and I want to get Bob's on your program
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:23.520]  let's go back I want to get Bob Chapman's take on all this in his comment
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:27.520]  but specifically more of what he told you about the Middle East because I'm
[02:41:27.520 --> 02:41:31.360]  going from memory now back in October and November and December but I remember
[02:41:31.360 --> 02:41:37.160]  you talking about Suez canal unrest Iran's back on the burner but but but
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:40.960]  that would mean that the globalists had implemented this in some way why would
[02:41:40.960 --> 02:41:47.280]  they why would they want this I mean specifically what did he say and what did
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:54.240]  the other mr. X say Lindsay all the routes that are taking place and how it
[02:41:54.240 --> 02:41:58.960]  was all brought about by the monetary crisis is happening over there the CIA's
[02:41:58.960 --> 02:42:03.680]  hand is all over this and remember I've tried my best to say this to your
[02:42:03.680 --> 02:42:08.200]  audience as many times as I can their positively is a group of people in the
[02:42:08.200 --> 02:42:11.480]  space of the earth and control the world they tell the president what to do they
[02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:16.040]  dictate to Congress what bills to pass everything you have ever said over your
[02:42:16.040 --> 02:42:20.680]  program Alex about these people I've verified it by actually having lived
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:24.440]  with them for three years and now we're seeing it take place right in front of
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:31.360]  our eyes Bob Chapman your take on this are questions for Lindsay well before he
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:39.160]  Lindsay said the last minute or two my question was going to be well did they
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:47.240]  predict that this was going to happen because of financial reasons or the the
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:55.600]  price of food and and selling starvation will call it but now Lindsay said that the
[02:42:55.600 --> 02:43:00.760]  actions that you're seeing I guess in Tunisia as well as Egypt had been planned
[02:43:00.760 --> 02:43:05.480]  that way is that right Lindsay that is correct I was told this and I came on
[02:43:05.480 --> 02:43:11.200]  Alex show show and you know okay let me go back to ways Alex you remember back
[02:43:11.200 --> 02:43:16.480]  about two years ago we had all of our forces over there right ready to around
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:21.920]  Iran the Navy Army and you said they're not gonna attack but yeah yeah and we
[02:43:21.920 --> 02:43:26.300]  were all saying we're ready for a crisis and I ran and I said I went to Mr.
[02:43:26.300 --> 02:43:30.120]  Farm and I said all we're gonna have a crisis with Iran now this was two years
[02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:34.640]  ago and you remember saying I did this on your program Alex and Mr. Farm just
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:39.360]  laughed on the radio on the phone and he said no Chaplin we are not going to have
[02:43:39.360 --> 02:43:44.640]  a crisis with Iran for two and a half years and then I remember the doctor
[02:43:44.640 --> 02:43:48.400]  Stan called me back about six months ago and said Lindsay it looks like we
[02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:52.200]  fixing to have a crisis with Iran and I went to my elitist friends and they
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:56.960]  said no it's not time yet and then I came on your show four months ago and I
[02:43:56.960 --> 02:44:02.480]  said I have just been told that they have said we want a crisis in the Middle
[02:44:02.480 --> 02:44:07.400]  East Alex that's exactly no you did say that it's on record so so but all I'm
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:11.920]  saying is obviously they know if the IMF orders Egypt and Tunisia and others to
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:15.600]  cut the food stamps and the people are on two dollars a day on average or half
[02:44:15.600 --> 02:44:19.760]  the populations of two dollars are below that that that they know it's gonna
[02:44:19.760 --> 02:44:23.920]  cause that crisis but my question is why would they want rebellion all over the
[02:44:23.920 --> 02:44:29.720]  Arab world with more pro-Muslim you know type groups that are seen as
[02:44:29.720 --> 02:44:33.560]  extremists coming to power is that a problem reaction solution I mean
[02:44:33.560 --> 02:44:38.040]  specifically they wanted this crisis right now in order to distract attention
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:42.040]  away from any things that are going on and you remember also that I said on
[02:44:42.040 --> 02:44:46.000]  your show about three months ago after I had talked with this other gentleman who
[02:44:46.000 --> 02:44:51.080]  gives me information he had said Chaplin don't pay any attention to what
[02:44:51.080 --> 02:44:55.000]  happens in the offer South Korea don't pay any attention to this crisis in the
[02:44:55.000 --> 02:44:59.480]  Middle East he said it is only a method of distracting people's attention away
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:03.680]  from some main issues and so that was the reason this is taking place over
[02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:08.640]  there right now they created it okay Bob Chapman what's your take on what
[02:45:08.640 --> 02:45:13.800]  Lindsey's Alex to the natural recipient of all of these problems is going to be
[02:45:13.800 --> 02:45:22.440]  Israel how is that well I think they'll benefit from it by having chaos to
[02:45:22.440 --> 02:45:26.880]  semi chaos because they'll be the only base left they'll be the only base of
[02:45:26.880 --> 02:45:33.200]  Egypt and all these other places fall and of Jordan falls which could happen
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:37.080]  or Saudi Arabia wow you I mean that would be a big crisis you think Israel
[02:45:37.080 --> 02:45:42.160]  wants to gamble that big you know I don't think they directly have anything to do
[02:45:42.160 --> 02:45:47.640]  with her at least I know I don't know that but what I do know is no matter
[02:45:47.640 --> 02:45:53.640]  who caused it whether it was delivered by the CIA or whether it was natural it's
[02:45:53.640 --> 02:45:59.760]  bad for them and it's really good for Israel there's no question it just the
[02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:03.560]  facts I mean if you get turmoil in the other places that these people don't
[02:46:03.560 --> 02:46:09.280]  like you well that's good they won't be bothering you amazing Lindsey your take
[02:46:09.280 --> 02:46:14.560]  on that angle the only thing I know is Alex I was told four months ago and I
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:19.080]  came on your program and said it they want a crisis in the Middle East now
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:24.280]  Bob Chapman you would know much more being the insider that you are as to
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:28.000]  why they would want it what their benefit would be all I knew was that
[02:46:28.000 --> 02:46:32.360]  they were going to have it and if this man was right about these things in the
[02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:38.000]  past please I beg of you I plead with you I cry out on this program and beg of
[02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:43.200]  you to listen to me if this man was right on all of these other things almost to
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:49.400]  the day the oil prices going from 147 to 50 actually went down to 34 two and one
[02:46:49.400 --> 02:46:55.160]  half years before the price will start up again it started up exactly two and a
[02:46:55.160 --> 02:46:59.720]  half years later the crisis in the Middle East they said in four months now
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:04.200]  if all of that took place exactly as the elite have it planned behind closed
[02:47:04.200 --> 02:47:08.600]  doors and mr. Fromm told me before he passed away please listen to what's
[02:47:08.600 --> 02:47:15.840]  going to happen now he said the dollar will be dead by the end of 2012 now if
[02:47:15.840 --> 02:47:19.040]  you have that happen if you don't want to pay attention to me or you don't want
[02:47:19.040 --> 02:47:23.520]  to listen to mr. Fromm before he passed away just read what Richard Russell wrote
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:29.360]  this past week he's the he's a lion with Wall Street in use letter writers he
[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:34.640]  said everything that mr. Fromm has told me for the past two years again I was
[02:47:34.640 --> 02:47:39.280]  told there's not going to be any shortage of food on the grocery store
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:43.840]  shelves but you probably will go hungry because you won't have the money to be
[02:47:43.840 --> 02:47:48.200]  able to buy it folks please I beg of you to listen to this for the sake of your
[02:47:48.200 --> 02:47:53.280]  dinner table again he said if it's written on a piece of paper it's worth
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:57.520]  the paper it's written on and so my friends called in the past week and they
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:48:02.760]  said oh chaplain you were wrong the price of gold is going down now and price
[02:48:02.760 --> 02:48:07.440]  of silver is going down I think we better sell I said don't do it I said
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:11.800]  please don't do it but if Lindsay if you look at the 11 or 10 year graph it's
[02:48:11.800 --> 02:48:17.080]  going straight up they always have these manipulations down overall I know who
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:21.600]  the other living executive is former CEO of a big three well coming even more
[02:48:21.600 --> 02:48:25.640]  high-powered than Ken Fromm head of operations for Atlantic Richfield who
[02:48:25.640 --> 02:48:32.080]  you on record work with for many years just all very very bizarre but we can
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:35.840]  see where this is all going what's your view just analyzing all the economic
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:42.480]  data where do you see the dollar at the end of 2012 Bob Chapman well if it's
[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:49.120]  against other currencies first of all I think that there's a good chance that
[02:48:49.120 --> 02:48:54.000]  Ireland in any election that's coming up next month will get rid of the party
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:58.120]  that they've got in the party that's coming in they don't like the banks at
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:06.560]  all many of them are X IRA people and I think they probably will renege they
[02:49:06.560 --> 02:49:10.600]  will default on their debt and I think they should quite frankly which is
[02:49:10.600 --> 02:49:15.640]  admitted it's not their dad it I mean that's admitted right it belongs to the
[02:49:15.640 --> 02:49:20.160]  people who own the banks that happens to be the Queen of England the Queen of
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:26.440]  Holland the Rothschilds etc and if that happens you'll drop out of the the Euro
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:32.080]  and to go back to the pond they'll leave the Eurozone might even leave the EU and
[02:49:32.080 --> 02:49:38.160]  that could start the ball rolling with grief with writing saying no we're not
[02:49:38.160 --> 02:49:42.800]  going to do that we want to follow Ireland and then in and then behind that
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:50.880]  you might have Portugal and in Belgium and maybe Spain and Italy as well and
[02:49:50.880 --> 02:49:56.360]  that'll kill the Euro how will that affect the dollar in killing the Euro
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:01.840]  it'll make the dollar go back up again but what you really have to weigh the
[02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:08.360]  dollar against is not other currencies this USDX is a distraction you got a
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:16.160]  you you have to weigh them versus gold and silver and for eleven years gold has
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:24.280]  gone up against every currency about 17 to 18 percent and against silver versus
[02:50:24.280 --> 02:50:31.880]  the currencies around 20 to 21 percent and that's the real guidepost the real
[02:50:31.880 --> 02:50:37.480]  mark not currency the currency same thing with oil oil overall is going way up
[02:50:37.480 --> 02:50:42.480]  and I want to come back and talk to both of you about what $150 barrel oil will
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:47.560]  do to this economy and the world economy on the other side with Bob Chapman
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:50.680]  and Lindsay Williams we'll go about five minutes into overdrive of both of you
[02:50:50.680 --> 02:50:55.040]  can do that maybe even a little bit more today our websites are present planet

[02:54:29.920 --> 02:54:34.600]  a mind control game we're gonna go five minutes and overdrive both our guests
[02:54:34.600 --> 02:54:40.960]  bare minimum it's such a mind control game to sit there and go oh look gold
[02:54:40.960 --> 02:54:44.600]  went down the last two weeks and they use people's short attention span it went
[02:54:44.600 --> 02:54:48.200]  down a little bit you put the 10-year graph 11-year graph it's going straight
[02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:53.440]  up with little blips down like steps going up I mean it's just ridiculous it
[02:54:53.440 --> 02:54:58.240]  be it barely goes down then goes up it's manipulation I mean I only promote what
[02:54:58.240 --> 02:55:01.280]  I believe in and I believe silver and gold's only going up there's a global
[02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:04.400]  devaluation we're gonna go back to Lindsay Williams but I wanted to throw out
[02:55:04.400 --> 02:55:09.680]  there he's made several DVDs and two new audio CDs breaking down all these
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:13.120]  predictions they've got the old DVDs that are just as important as it's the
[02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:17.800]  same info now and I'd say what Mr. Fromm and the other oil exec told him about
[02:55:17.800 --> 02:55:24.480]  97% accurate and it's really been stunning 800-686-2337 if you want to

[02:55:35.480 --> 02:55:43.240]  and I'll give that out again before he leaves us look Lindsay looking at this
[02:55:43.240 --> 02:55:50.720]  well I want to have Bob basically ask the question Bob do you think there's a
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:54.360]  lot of validity I mean obviously most of the stuff's come true that we could see
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:59.080]  $150 a barrel oil and what would that do to our economy if that happened and
[02:55:59.080 --> 02:56:05.920]  went for a long sustained time well first of all we're seeing the genesis of
[02:56:05.920 --> 02:56:12.120]  it right now and and you know Suez was half burning the military there have
[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:19.160]  been shooting people for three days and Cairo is wild but it's nothing like
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:27.320]  Suez and so maybe this is the event that will start to bring oil prices higher
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:32.880]  but it looks organic it looks organic chaos for weeks absolutely and I am
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:37.360]  reading here violence escalates in Egypt as protesters torch ruling party
[02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:40.440]  headquarters in Cairo says they've routed the police and are burning
[02:56:40.440 --> 02:56:45.360]  buildings all over Suez and I remember four months ago three months ago a
[02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:49.480]  month ago Lindsey saying watch the Middle East it's gonna blow up it watch
[02:56:49.480 --> 02:56:53.520]  the Suez canal did your sources tell you anything else when they said Suez
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:58.440]  canal Lindsey yes they very definitely said there was going to be a crisis in
[02:56:58.440 --> 02:57:03.040]  the Middle East they were very firm about the fact that they wanted a crisis
[02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:07.240]  in the Middle East they said that the price of gasoline at the gas pump was
[02:57:07.240 --> 02:57:11.920]  going to four to five dollars a gallon I'm warning you folks I plead with you
[02:57:11.920 --> 02:57:17.600]  gold and silver prices are only going to go in one direction they said if it's
[02:57:17.600 --> 02:57:20.680]  worth if it's written on a piece of paper it's worth the paper it's written
[02:57:20.680 --> 02:57:25.360]  on they said our currency is gold and silver it's the only thing you can
[02:57:25.360 --> 02:57:29.400]  maintain your purchasing power with and folks even though you've seen a little
[02:57:29.400 --> 02:57:34.440]  back set in gold and silver prices recently it doesn't mean one thing the
[02:57:34.440 --> 02:57:39.480]  price is going back up drastically you have not even seen the beginning of a
[02:57:39.480 --> 02:57:43.440]  shot up by $40 today and silver by a dollar we're gonna go to break come
[02:57:43.440 --> 02:57:46.920]  back and pretty much give you most the floor with a few comments from Bob and
[02:57:46.920 --> 02:57:50.320]  we appreciate joining us the next five minutes but Bob where do you see gold
[02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:58.440]  going well endlessly higher and nobody knows how far it could be six seven
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:02.680]  eight nine ten thousand dollars but I think a shot for this year for two
[02:58:02.680 --> 02:58:08.560]  thousand or 2400 is a good one we're looking at gold up $20 right now we're
[02:58:08.560 --> 02:58:13.680]  looking at oil up 370 which bears out what Lindsay's talking about I mean this
[02:58:13.680 --> 02:58:18.160]  turmoil could go on for weeks or months I mean there could be a civil war in the
[02:58:18.160 --> 02:58:25.080]  country with the canal be shut down maybe if it is what Lindsay has had to say
[02:58:25.080 --> 02:58:31.480]  about 147 150 oil that's doable that's right yeah 10 earlier said it had shot up
[02:58:31.480 --> 02:58:36.800]  almost 40 but it shot up 30 and is down dropped down to 22 up we'll be right back
[02:58:36.800 --> 02:58:41.760]  in 62nd state where this transmission will continue
[02:58:42.960 --> 02:58:52.280]  thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today this is Alex Jones with
[02:58:52.280 --> 02:58:56.040]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[02:58:56.040 --> 02:58:59.800]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[02:58:59.800 --> 02:59:04.320]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[02:59:04.320 --> 02:59:08.520]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[02:59:08.520 --> 02:59:13.160]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:59:13.160 --> 02:59:17.160]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[02:59:17.160 --> 02:59:21.280]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[02:59:21.280 --> 02:59:25.240]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[02:59:25.240 --> 02:59:29.400]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[02:59:29.400 --> 02:59:33.200]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[02:59:33.200 --> 02:59:36.720]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[02:59:57.200 --> 03:00:13.720]  Jones Broadcasting Network okay we're into overdrive right now up on the
[03:00:13.720 --> 03:00:16.800]  drugs report they have a live feed from Al Jazeera we're gonna add that to

[03:00:20.560 --> 03:00:25.280]  continued updates and coverage we're doing some upgrades to the site and other
[03:00:25.280 --> 03:00:27.440]  things this weekend anyway so we're gonna be a lot of us here over the
[03:00:27.440 --> 03:00:30.920]  weekend wonderful crew couldn't do it without them and you the listeners your
[03:00:30.920 --> 03:00:34.600]  support Bob Chapman joins us every Friday Lindsey Williams I'll definitely
[03:00:34.600 --> 03:00:38.280]  have you back up if you can do it next week for a full hour to take calls people
[03:00:38.280 --> 03:00:43.680]  want to talk to you but Bob Chapman you were just and I want to get Lindsey's
[03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:47.720]  take on this you were just talking about revolution or insurrection in this
[03:00:47.720 --> 03:00:56.160]  country why do you say that oh I think that as we had this deterioration let's
[03:00:56.160 --> 03:01:04.840]  say that gasoline goes for 450 a gallon the bill for the United States at 450 a
[03:01:04.840 --> 03:01:13.400]  gallon or we'll project 120 dollar oil would do that you're looking at something
[03:01:13.400 --> 03:01:18.760]  on the order of 250 billion dollars and increased costs that'll have to be
[03:01:18.760 --> 03:01:25.960]  devoted to paying for the oil as well as the increased prices for food and then
[03:01:25.960 --> 03:01:32.360]  you know oil may be shut off from time to time as well and so the cost of doing
[03:01:32.360 --> 03:01:36.880]  things is going to go up you get to over 22% unemployment hey Jen interrupt you
[03:01:36.880 --> 03:01:40.600]  we're watching live streams from Al Jazeera linking it up on infowars.com
[03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:45.760]  prisonbunna.com and betting it right now Al Jazeera there are tanks running
[03:01:45.760 --> 03:01:50.440]  around they just cut from the live stream people being shot I mean this is
[03:01:50.440 --> 03:01:55.520]  total bedlam and the military has been able in 77 and before that to put down
[03:01:55.520 --> 03:01:58.760]  insurrections do you think they're going to be successful this time or will they
[03:01:58.760 --> 03:02:03.040]  join the people Bob I know about joining the people but I don't think they're
[03:02:03.040 --> 03:02:08.840]  going to be successful I think the people have had it and they get they're
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:12.680]  going to go for it they got a amount numbered a hundred to one Lindsey
[03:02:12.680 --> 03:02:16.720]  Williams what's your take on what Bob was just saying about and the media can
[03:02:16.720 --> 03:02:19.840]  tell us the economy's great here but all the statistics show we're going into a
[03:02:19.840 --> 03:02:23.560]  depression increased oil prices when they had him a few years ago a lot of
[03:02:23.560 --> 03:02:28.720]  people couldn't go to work who were on fixed incomes I mean what's the elites
[03:02:28.720 --> 03:02:32.880]  take that you talked to on on insurrection in the US the elite
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:36.880]  positively made it plain to be on stated on your program pull months ago that
[03:02:36.880 --> 03:02:41.400]  what you're seeing in front of your eyes right now what you just reported a
[03:02:41.400 --> 03:02:45.560]  moment ago was going to take place within four to five months and it's
[03:02:45.560 --> 03:02:49.360]  happening almost to the day what's going to happen in the United States of
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:54.480]  America well let me tell you what's going to happen it's very plain to see
[03:02:54.480 --> 03:02:59.720]  suppose the grocery stores ships are full but the dollar has collapsed to the
[03:02:59.720 --> 03:03:05.600]  point that people are going hungry now Alex common sense tells you what the
[03:03:05.600 --> 03:03:12.440]  what the mindset of the people I'm 75 years of age but when I was a boy you
[03:03:12.440 --> 03:03:16.320]  wouldn't have had people looting grocery stores you wouldn't have had mass
[03:03:16.320 --> 03:03:20.760]  battle in this country where you had to get your firearms out today with the
[03:03:20.760 --> 03:03:25.840]  mindset of the average young person Lord have mercy on us when this does happen
[03:03:25.840 --> 03:03:31.320]  and people can't are going hungry out there I think it stands to reason what's
[03:03:31.320 --> 03:03:34.600]  going to take place just common sense would tell you the elite have not said
[03:03:34.600 --> 03:03:39.400]  to me that there was going to be routing in the streets in America but they told
[03:03:39.400 --> 03:03:43.680]  me everything that was going to take place before mr. prom died he told me
[03:03:43.680 --> 03:03:49.120]  everything that they were going to do and do results of what they said they were
[03:03:49.120 --> 03:03:55.720]  going to do his chaos and battle them Alex well now is the time to get the
[03:03:55.720 --> 03:03:59.720]  word out as Ron Paul has said that the bankers have engineered this don't let
[03:03:59.720 --> 03:04:03.760]  them use the crisis to get even more power as Bob said earlier in the hour
[03:04:03.760 --> 03:04:08.800]  to establish world government and gentlemen I want to thank you both for
