[00:00.000 --> 00:08.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08.000 --> 00:12.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:14.000 --> 00:18.000]  Good afternoon, good evening ladies and gentlemen.
[00:18.000 --> 00:23.000]  Info warriors, resistance fighters out on the battlefield of ideas.
[00:23.000 --> 00:27.000]  This is the Alex Jones Show and I'm Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:27.000 --> 00:31.000]  Alex is out sick today so I'll be sitting in for the first hour.
[00:31.000 --> 00:38.000]  Probably taking some of your calls later and hopefully Alex will be back in the hot seat tomorrow
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  and the second hour of today's show will be a re-broadcast of recent interviews.
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  Firstly we're going to update you on the latest situation with what's happening in the oil rich country of Libya
[00:51.000 --> 00:59.000]  over which the United States, the UK and the United Nations have suddenly developed collective consciences
[00:59.000 --> 01:06.000]  for quote, humanitarian suffering and as I wrote last week in an article entitled
[01:06.000 --> 01:16.000]  US Special Forces Arriving Libya in which it was also detailed how British Special Forces had arrived in Benghazi
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  the stage for a coup d'etat on Gaddafi is now being carefully set.
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  And we've got this story out of Sky News today.
[01:26.000 --> 01:37.000]  Eight SAS soldiers held by rebels, eight SAS soldiers have been detained by rebels in Libya according to Sky News sources.
[01:37.000 --> 01:42.000]  Rebel sources told Sky that the group are being held in Libya's second city in Benghazi
[01:42.000 --> 01:49.000]  according to the sources British diplomat who is with the unit is now negotiating for their release.
[01:49.000 --> 01:54.000]  The rebels say the soldiers are being well treated and the issue will soon be resolved.
[01:54.000 --> 02:00.000]  The Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office have neither confirmed or denied the reports.
[02:00.000 --> 02:07.000]  Now of course last week we had one of the rebel leaders saying that foreign intervention would not be welcome
[02:07.000 --> 02:14.000]  but then a day later calling for the aid of UN led humanitarian airstrikes
[02:14.000 --> 02:23.000]  and it appears that the capture of these SAS soldiers is about the rebels entering the council
[02:23.000 --> 02:30.000]  attempting to achieve some kind of diplomatic recognition which would aid them of course in overthrowing Gaddafi
[02:30.000 --> 02:37.000]  and increasing pressure on the UN to impose sanctions on his regime.
[02:37.000 --> 02:44.000]  But this SAS intervention which we picked up on after it had been reported by the Pakistani observer
[02:44.000 --> 02:51.000]  that special forces had indeed landed on February 22nd and 23rd last month
[02:51.000 --> 02:59.000]  has stoked anger among some of the rebels because they fear that Gaddafi will use it as propaganda
[02:59.000 --> 03:09.000]  to cite Western foreign military involvement as a propaganda tool with which to rally patriotic fervour
[03:09.000 --> 03:15.000]  and certainly if we look at the attempted Iranian revolution last year
[03:15.000 --> 03:23.000]  one of the primary reasons behind its failure was Ahmadinejad's ability to point to the fact that the US government
[03:23.000 --> 03:31.000]  had used the MEK and Jundullah which of course as our readers will know is an al-Qaeda link terror group
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  that's right the CIA has been graciously bankrolling them to overthrow the Iranians
[03:36.000 --> 03:43.000]  to destabilize Iran in preparation for these student protests which happened last year
[03:43.000 --> 03:51.000]  and by citing Western intervention Ahmadinejad was able to rally the poorer segments of the population
[03:51.000 --> 03:59.000]  around this patriotic fervour and thereby derail the momentum of the younger revolutionaries
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  so you could certainly see similar consequences unfolding in Libya
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  but the fact is our report from last week is now confirmed
[04:09.000 --> 04:17.000]  British SAS soldiers of course famous for their shenanigans in joyriding around Iraqi tribal areas
[04:17.000 --> 04:23.000]  with fake wigs and Arab headdressed guns and explosives as they were caught doing
[04:23.000 --> 04:30.000]  have now been identified and caught and are there on the ground in Libya trying to support the rebels
[04:30.000 --> 04:34.000]  whether the rebels want that support or not
[04:34.000 --> 04:37.000]  of course just like in America for the past week or more
[04:37.000 --> 04:42.000]  in the UK there's been a phony debate about whether we should get behind sending in troops
[04:42.000 --> 04:49.000]  for humanitarian assistance nothing of course to do with the fact that Libya holds the largest oil reserves
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  in the whole of Africa pure coincidence
[04:52.000 --> 04:58.000]  but the SAS the special forces are now going in for humanitarian aid
[04:58.000 --> 05:19.000]  we'll be back
[05:19.000 --> 05:32.000]  not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[05:32.000 --> 05:40.000]  this includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the silver lung system
[05:44.000 --> 05:51.000]  at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  as well we are always ready to answer any questions you may have
[05:55.000 --> 06:00.000]  that's www.silverlungs.com
[06:00.000 --> 06:05.000]  the Genesis communications radio network probably presents the Alex Jones show
[06:05.000 --> 06:11.000]  because there's a war on for your mind
[06:11.000 --> 06:14.000]  we're back on the Alex Jones show Sunday edition
[06:14.000 --> 06:19.000]  so we've got confirmation that British SAS troops are now in Libya
[06:19.000 --> 06:25.000]  we've had some kind of phony debate in Britain over the past two weeks about whether we should send in troops
[06:25.000 --> 06:28.000]  they've already been there for two weeks
[06:28.000 --> 06:34.000]  and of course if British SAS troops are there then you know it's virtually guaranteed
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  that American special forces are also on the ground
[06:39.000 --> 06:43.000]  and of course there'll be no time for a real debate or God forbid
[06:43.000 --> 06:49.000]  a congressional authorization when that is indeed confirmed
[06:49.000 --> 06:58.000]  and of course we'll all be along for the ride as this humanitarian war is sold to us by public relations firms
[06:58.000 --> 07:03.000]  using emotional drivel and heart-rending propaganda
[07:03.000 --> 07:11.000]  just like the contrived Balkans war was sold under Bill Clinton with the aid of fake concentration camps
[07:11.000 --> 07:23.000]  and just like the first Gulf War was sold under Bush Senior with the aid of a manufactured story about Iraqis throwing Q80 babies out of incubators
[07:23.000 --> 07:29.000]  and just watch as the so-called liberals vehemently get in line
[07:29.000 --> 07:36.000]  to parrot the teleprompter reading Barry Satoro, the man who campaigned on change and peace
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  yet now as more troops deployed than at any time under Bush
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  the man who aggressively expanded the predator drone strikes
[07:45.000 --> 07:49.000]  that continued to kill scores of innocent people every month
[07:49.000 --> 07:55.000]  so just sit by and watch as the likes of Media Matters and Think Progress
[07:55.000 --> 08:01.000]  the premier neoliberal propaganda whores for the Obama White House
[08:01.000 --> 08:05.000]  keep it well and truly zipped
[08:05.000 --> 08:11.000]  and that segues into our second topic that I wanted to cover today
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  which is new media versus old media
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  because habitually Media Matters and Think Progress
[08:20.000 --> 08:25.000]  put out five-page articles listing the statements made on this show
[08:25.000 --> 08:29.000]  as if that alone somehow discredits us
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.000]  they don't even try to point out why what we're saying is wrong
[08:34.000 --> 08:42.000]  because they still live under the delusion that they're fooling anyone other than their own sycophantic neoliberal audience
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  and there's another Media Matters hit piece out today
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  relating to the Bill O'Reilly clip which we'll go on to discuss shortly
[08:51.000 --> 08:55.000]  if the studio could queue up Bill O'Reilly
[08:55.000 --> 09:02.000]  and basically Media Matters has jumped on this as a bandwagon to attack both Fox News and Alex Jones
[09:02.000 --> 09:07.000]  habitually as I said they put out five-page smears
[09:07.000 --> 09:13.000]  listing statements made on this show as if merely repeating them alone somehow debunks them
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  and of course Media Matters will fail to list the statements
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.000]  that directly prove that they're nothing more than a water carrier for the Obama White House
[09:24.000 --> 09:33.000]  Media Matters is funded by the billionaire globalist George Soros
[09:33.000 --> 09:40.000]  the same man who just this week incited the next US military industrial complex
[09:40.000 --> 09:49.000]  to overthrow of a sovereign government by targeting Iran for quote the bloodiest of revolutions
[09:49.000 --> 09:56.000]  George Soros the man who funds Media Matters targeting Iran for the bloodiest of revolutions
[09:56.000 --> 10:04.000]  and of course Media Matters is behind the progressive media campaign which was launched in 2008
[10:04.000 --> 10:15.000]  all of which in their own words is to become a quote war room for promoting the foreign and domestic policies of Barack Obama
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  and these are the same people who claim they are non-partisan
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.000]  they claim they're a legitimate media organization
[10:24.000 --> 10:30.000]  of course Media Matters was started by John Podesta and the Center for American Progress
[10:30.000 --> 10:39.000]  its own director Jennifer Palmiere admits is about quote driving the White House's message and agenda
[10:39.000 --> 10:47.000]  oh again let's see Media Matters include those statements in their next hit piece
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.000]  seeing as they're so obsessed with virulently attacking us
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.000]  I think perhaps it might be something to do with the fact that prisonplanet.com
[10:57.000 --> 11:06.000]  alone gets twice the amount of traffic compared to Media Matters.org according to Alexa.com
[11:06.000 --> 11:15.000]  and indeed Infowars.com gets around four times the amount of visitors compared to Media Matters.org
[11:15.000 --> 11:19.000]  but you won't see them include in that statement in their next hit piece
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.000]  the fact that in total we get about six times more traffic than them
[11:23.000 --> 11:32.000]  because we actually try to go after the truth rather than admittingly being water carriers for the Obama White House
[11:32.000 --> 11:42.000]  the very organization that started Media Matters and their own campaign
[11:42.000 --> 11:50.000]  the 2008 Progressive Media campaign is admittedly about driving the White House's message and agenda
[11:50.000 --> 11:57.000]  and they've got the nerve to tell their readers that they're non-partisan
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  while George Soros quietly slips them another million dollars
[12:02.000 --> 12:07.000]  how about you include that statement in your next hit piece Media Matters
[12:07.000 --> 12:11.000]  and you can say what you like about Alex Jones or Infowars
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.000]  but at least we're funded by our own listeners
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.000]  you know there's no billionaire globalist buttering our bread
[12:21.000 --> 12:26.000]  and the new media is about the power of the grassroots getting beyond the left-right hoax
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.000]  to point out that the true architecture of control
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  and of course in pointing out who controls that power system
[12:37.000 --> 12:48.000]  we get called due hating extremist radical terrorists by media organizations such as Media Matters and the SPLC
[12:48.000 --> 12:55.000]  while simultaneously they can't seem to grasp the fact that they no longer have the power to dictate reality
[12:55.000 --> 13:01.000]  because as I just said despite the fact that we're not funded by billionaire globalists
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  we'll dwarf them in terms of size, readership and influence
[13:07.000 --> 13:15.000]  which is pretty amazing if you think about it because when I visited Alex's office in 2005
[13:15.000 --> 13:19.000]  about six coming up to six years ago
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  there was basically one lady doing customer service
[13:22.000 --> 13:27.000]  there were two guys running Infowars and another one
[13:27.000 --> 13:32.000]  only one guy running Infowars at the time and another one was doing video editing
[13:32.000 --> 13:37.000]  and that was it, apart from myself, that was the entire organization
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  and in fact back in those days Alex didn't even have a radio producer
[13:42.000 --> 13:48.000]  he had to do it himself because there were literally about four employees
[13:48.000 --> 13:54.000]  now granted the organization has grown moderately in the past five or six years
[13:54.000 --> 14:01.000]  but we've got nothing like the kind of resources enjoyed by these old media dinosaurs
[14:01.000 --> 14:09.000]  with their globalist billions of networks like MSNBC funded by General Electric
[14:09.000 --> 14:15.000]  and yet still Infowars.com gets more readers than MSNBC.com
[14:15.000 --> 14:19.000]  despite the fact that it's David versus Goliath
[14:19.000 --> 14:26.000]  we're still beating the crap out of them and that's why they're so petrified of our growing influence
[14:26.000 --> 14:33.000]  because we're completely seizing control of their ability to dictate reality
[14:33.000 --> 14:41.000]  just as Hillary Clinton said this week in front of a panel on Capitol Hill
[14:41.000 --> 14:51.000]  organizations that cover quote real news not left right sideshows, in other words the new media
[14:51.000 --> 14:56.000]  are now winning the information war and they're losing
[14:56.000 --> 15:03.000]  and she cited Russia today which of course routinely gives a platform to the likes of Alex Jones
[15:03.000 --> 15:10.000]  Webster Tarpley, Paul Craig Roberts, Wayne Madsen, Max Kaiser
[15:10.000 --> 15:15.000]  and this is a news organization that's growing in leaps and bams
[15:15.000 --> 15:23.000]  which is why indeed they were targeted Russia today when they tried to put advertisements up in US airports
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  that merely encouraged people to think about both sides of a story
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  oh no can't have that, these posters were immediately torn down
[15:32.000 --> 15:39.000]  and that's what I'm talking about, they're petrified about the new media seizing their ability to dictate reality
[15:39.000 --> 15:42.000]  and we're going to get to this Bill O'Reilly clip after the break
[15:42.000 --> 15:47.000]  and we're going to talk more about old media versus new media on the Alex Jones show
[15:47.000 --> 16:10.000]  I'm Paul Joseph Watson, stay tuned
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.000]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[16:32.000 --> 16:35.000]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[16:35.000 --> 16:40.000]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.000]  folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[16:44.000 --> 16:49.000]  one of my oldest sponsors, you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.000]  that's mysolarbackup.com, remember the government doesn't own the sun

[17:07.000 --> 17:12.000]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working
[17:12.000 --> 17:18.000]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  not worried about them moving itself
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow
[17:27.000 --> 17:33.000]  I'm looking for America

[17:48.000 --> 17:51.000]  Long gone
[17:51.000 --> 17:54.000]  But I know in my heart it's still nothing
[17:54.000 --> 18:09.000]  And again, go to gusset.com forward slash America today

[20:04.000 --> 20:10.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[20:10.000 --> 20:21.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[20:21.000 --> 20:31.000]  This is Paul Joseph Watson, editor and writer for prisonplanet.com
[20:31.000 --> 20:39.000]  We're going to take some of your calls a little later in the hour
[20:39.000 --> 20:50.000]  The calling number is 877-789-2539
[20:50.000 --> 20:54.000]  We're talking about old media versus new media
[20:54.000 --> 21:04.000]  And another example of the old media flailing in their desperate attempt to stay relevant with Bill O'Reilly of Fox News
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.000]  Play the clip
[21:08.000 --> 21:14.000]  Bill has selected The View and Charlie Sheens has a friend in the media, some guy on the radio
[21:14.000 --> 21:19.000]  We don't really know who he is but he goes on The View and this is what happens
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  We've got the TSA putting their hand down people's pants, infowars.com covers it all
[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  We've got the banks bankrupting the U.S.
[21:26.000 --> 21:32.000]  Let's stick with Charlie because that's way too much
[21:32.000 --> 21:35.000]  He's still 23.7 trillion
[21:35.000 --> 21:40.000]  We're just here to figure out what is happening with Charlie, that's what we're trying to figure out
[21:40.000 --> 21:42.000]  Oh they've been comparing him to Gaddafi
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  Look, I was just saying, I don't think I even heard him
[21:44.000 --> 21:49.000]  There was Bush, a million dollar Rockies at the top of it
[21:49.000 --> 21:58.000]  I think we were here to talk about Charlie Sheens
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  I don't know if that was the best booking choice
[22:01.000 --> 22:07.000]  The real achievement here, Bill, is that this guy made the women on The View seem sane
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  No, here's the real achievement, they didn't walk off with that guy
[22:09.000 --> 22:12.000]  Yeah, they walked off when you were there but they actually tolerated him
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  This guy thinks America is a police state, yet he has a radio program
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  He's allowed to say whatever he wants, they can never actually
[22:20.000 --> 22:25.000]  But this is why it's so dumb, that what did the ladies think they were going to get when they invited a guy like this in
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.000]  I mean, he took the show over, he did exactly what he wanted and that was it
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  He gave me a headache, he gave them a headache, I don't know why they booked the guy
[22:32.000 --> 22:35.000]  Alright, dumbest thing of the week
[22:35.000 --> 22:41.000]  So there you have it, quote, some guy on the radio we really don't know who he is
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  Now, of course, Bill O'Reilly knows exactly who Alex Jones is
[22:46.000 --> 22:53.000]  But again, the old media are so scared of us that they dare not even mention Alex's name
[22:53.000 --> 22:58.000]  Well, Bill, if you're still in the dark as to who Alex Jones is
[22:58.000 --> 23:04.000]  That's the guy who's completely creaming you in interacting listeners and readers
[23:04.000 --> 23:15.000]  That's the guy who just, one of his websites is 43,000 places above your website on Alexa.com
[23:15.000 --> 23:20.000]  I mean, this is truly pathetic, BillOReilly.com
[23:20.000 --> 23:27.000]  His flagship website is numbered 45,000 on Alexa
[23:27.000 --> 23:31.000]  Compared to Infowars.com, which is at around 2000
[23:31.000 --> 23:36.000]  Okay, the lower the rank, the more visitors to your website
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  I mean, 45,000, that's awful
[23:40.000 --> 23:48.000]  There are bloggers with little websites who write one article a day about the truth, God forbid
[23:48.000 --> 23:52.000]  And they're blowing O'Reilly away in terms of readership
[23:52.000 --> 24:00.000]  I mean, just one guy who decides to start writing an article a day in his spare time about the economic collapse, for example
[24:00.000 --> 24:04.000]  The economic collapse blog.com
[24:04.000 --> 24:11.000]  And almost instantly, he's creaming Fox News' biggest talking head
[24:11.000 --> 24:19.000]  One guy, there's probably little old ladies who write about cooking that get more readers than BillOReilly
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.000]  I mean, this is a guy who's lost two thirds of his geriatric TV audience
[24:25.000 --> 24:29.000]  Probably because most of them have croaked it in the last few years alone
[24:29.000 --> 24:34.000]  And yet, he's got the nerve to pretend he doesn't even know who Alex Jones is
[24:34.000 --> 24:45.000]  Well, that's the guy, BillO, who every time he's on CNN and all these other networks is invited to appear on Fox News
[24:45.000 --> 24:50.000]  But then gets cancelled when certain talking heads at Fox News throw hissy fits
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  Which is exactly what happened with Alex a week ago
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.000]  Again, quote, some guy on the radio, we really don't know who he is
[24:59.000 --> 25:05.000]  Maybe it's the guy who Rolling Stone magazine just did a six page spread about
[25:05.000 --> 25:17.000]  Including one article which documented how Fox News' Glenn Beck tries to stay relevant by stealing Alex Jones' material
[25:17.000 --> 25:28.000]  And I'm afraid BillO, the numbers don't lie, while you're hemorrhaging viewers to your TV show
[25:28.000 --> 25:37.000]  And visitors to your pathetic website, again, 45,000 on Alexa, our ratings are exploding
[25:37.000 --> 25:43.000]  You know, in a few years time, BillOReilly might be referred to as some guy on the TV
[25:43.000 --> 25:47.000]  Were it not for the fact that he's got this hilarious YouTube meltdown
[25:47.000 --> 25:55.000]  Which of course tells us everything we need to know about his putrid personality and the way he treats people
[25:55.000 --> 26:00.000]  But again, it's another example of old media
[26:00.000 --> 26:05.000]  Now there's smart old media and there's dumb old media
[26:05.000 --> 26:13.000]  And the likes of O'Reilly and Media Matters are just plain dumb and their haughtiness will spell their downfall
[26:13.000 --> 26:20.000]  Because they refuse to adapt, they still live under this delusion that they've got millions and millions of viewers
[26:20.000 --> 26:26.000]  That believe what they say when in fact they're losing viewers every single year
[26:26.000 --> 26:36.000]  Then you've got the likes of Glenn Beck, who understands that to maintain his audience, he needs to put on sheep's clothing
[26:36.000 --> 26:47.000]  And rebrand himself as the new alternative, a true patriot, by basically copying Alex Jones' material to remain relevant
[26:47.000 --> 26:55.000]  That's old media posing as new media, hijacking new media to stay in the game
[26:55.000 --> 27:01.000]  But the interesting thing about this Bill O'Reilly clip and his other guest says that
[27:01.000 --> 27:06.000]  Well, if we're living in a police state, why is Alex Jones able to say what he likes?
[27:06.000 --> 27:14.000]  Well, you can still live in a police state and have to tacit freedom to express your dissatisfaction
[27:14.000 --> 27:20.000]  Doesn't mean that there aren't TSA radiation vans rolling down the high street and the highways
[27:20.000 --> 27:27.000]  Doesn't mean there aren't swarms of TSA goons in train stations frisking nine-year-olds
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  Just because Alex Jones is allowed to talk about it
[27:32.000 --> 27:41.000]  But again, the thing about this Bill O'Reilly clip is the fact that after it came out, media matters from the left side of the fake paradigm
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  Then writes an article about it
[27:44.000 --> 27:57.000]  And again, media matters, I dare you to address the statements made about how you yourselves admit that you're nothing more than a propaganda whore for the Obama White House
[27:57.000 --> 28:02.000]  Media matters writes an article on this attempting to smear Fox News
[28:02.000 --> 28:10.000]  Because Andrew Napolitano had Jones appear on his Fox Business show and wait for it
[28:10.000 --> 28:17.000]  Alex Jones talks about 9-Eleven Truth, oh my god, yes, he actually commits the thought crime
[28:17.000 --> 28:23.000]  He commits the thought crime of agreeing with six of the 10, 9-Eleven commissioners
[28:23.000 --> 28:31.000]  So we've got media matters with a publicly stated agenda to drive home Obama's propaganda
[28:31.000 --> 28:37.000]  This is their own people saying this, they admit to it and then they claim they're non-partisan
[28:37.000 --> 28:45.000]  Media matters ring fencing the mere thought of saying 9-Eleven didn't happen perfectly as the government said it did
[28:45.000 --> 28:50.000]  Which is what Napolitano said, ring fencing it as a thought crime
[28:50.000 --> 28:56.000]  We'll be back to discuss it more and we'll also take your calls, this is the Alex Jones show

[31:54.000 --> 32:16.000]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years
[32:16.000 --> 32:26.000]  The crazy part is, he's usually right, you see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[32:30.000 --> 32:37.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener
[32:37.000 --> 32:41.000]  I can't stress this enough, you should at least watch this free video online today
[32:41.000 --> 32:46.000]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[32:46.000 --> 32:50.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com

[33:26.000 --> 33:33.000]  Sunday, March the 6th, it's the Alex Jones show live, I'm Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex
[33:33.000 --> 33:40.000]  We'll be going to your calls shortly, the number is 877-789-2539
[33:40.000 --> 33:43.000]  We'll be going to Henry in Canada and Ty in New York
[33:43.000 --> 33:56.000]  But we have Alex Jones calling in to discuss this Bill O'Reilly clip and the big smear attempt between Fox News and Media Matters
[33:56.000 --> 34:03.000]  Alex, what do you think about the fact that Bill O'Reilly claims he's never heard of you or what you do
[34:03.000 --> 34:13.000]  When in fact you're completely creaming him on Alexa, infowars.com is 43,000 places higher in the rankings than Bill O'Reilly.com
[34:13.000 --> 34:18.000]  To be clear, some of the biggest newspapers in the country aren't as big as infowars.com
[34:18.000 --> 34:26.000]  It's rated in the US about 400 just to give people an idea of how huge it is and it's growing exponentially
[34:26.000 --> 34:35.000]  We don't normally get into these media wars and of course I've got a stomach bug so I'm out today, I appreciate you filling in Paul but I feel better so I'm calling in
[34:35.000 --> 34:40.000]  I just want to point out that I'm glad, I mean I'm sad that he's lying and when he lied they all laughed about it
[34:40.000 --> 34:50.000]  But I'm glad that when the White House a month ago put out a press release attacking our story about carbon taxes
[34:50.000 --> 34:56.000]  And the shutdown of power plants being associated with the blackouts during the cold weather
[34:56.000 --> 35:04.000]  I'm glad that they didn't give me credit in there, they just said oh an unreputable source even though we all know it was Drudge, Lincoln Doss and the Heritage Foundation
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  And then the major Texas power authority came out and said that I was correct days later
[35:08.000 --> 35:14.000]  I'm glad, they're so scared of me that they just said a source so evil that we won't even link to them
[35:14.000 --> 35:23.000]  It's the same thing with Bill O'Reilly, it's the same thing with all these people, they're so scared of us that he would disdain his dwindling audience of about a million and a half people
[35:23.000 --> 35:31.000]  It was five million, six, seven years ago, that he would sit there and lie to them and tell them we don't know who this guy is when they're playing a clip of me from the view
[35:31.000 --> 35:37.000]  But here's the issue, it almost discredits me to go on the view, it discredits me, Bill O'Reilly did endorse me
[35:37.000 --> 35:48.000]  Politico last year when they were trying to destroy Rand Paul, the mainstream media was, in a Senate race said well what can bring down Rand Paul and I said one thing, if the mainstream media endorses him
[35:48.000 --> 35:55.000]  Attacking his approval ratings will go up and that actually happened, Bill Clinton went to campaign against him and he gained about six points in a week
[35:55.000 --> 36:04.000]  The more lies they put out the higher he went, you guys are discredited, you're a joke and that's the bottom line and that's why all over the place they dare not speak our name
[36:04.000 --> 36:10.000]  They dare not talk about us, forget just the internet numbers, forget having the number one podcast with over 400,000 every day
[36:10.000 --> 36:17.000]  Forget being number one on Shotcast with over 300,000 tuning into live streams a day, forget the fact that we're all over 80 AM and FM stations now
[36:17.000 --> 36:23.000]  Bill O'Reilly had to leave talk radio because the audience was too smart for him, they only had a few million listeners when he left
[36:23.000 --> 36:31.000]  We're up to four million a week now, we are the underdog coming from behind, climbing up the mountain towards the enemy in placements in the Info War
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.000]  And we're going to defeat them and it's that simple, so I love it, I absolutely love it
[36:37.000 --> 36:43.000]  When they sit there and try to act like they're the grand gatekeepers and they decide what their listeners can hear and see
[36:43.000 --> 36:52.000]  And it's the old folks that warned people about the New World Order decades ago, but it is true that most of his audience is nearing the grave
[36:52.000 --> 37:00.000]  Most of Fox News audience is nearing the grave and we're out there reaching out to the young people and that's why they're so scared
[37:00.000 --> 37:07.000]  There's a lot of older folks out there that know more about this than somebody who's 37 like myself or 28 like yourself, Paul
[37:07.000 --> 37:12.000]  It's just that they are hating their audience, they are disdainful, they constantly lie
[37:12.000 --> 37:20.000]  Here's one more example, I've seen Fox News, I've seen all the major channels, when Ron Paul, two years in a row won the Scraw Poll
[37:20.000 --> 37:25.000]  The guys could queue it up for the next segment if you want, and they had to apologize when we pointed it out a month ago
[37:25.000 --> 37:32.000]  Or three and a half weeks ago, we pointed it out at infowars.com, they weren't going to apologize, two days later they were forced to
[37:32.000 --> 37:40.000]  They took booing and basically dubbed it over Ron Paul to make it look like he was booed when he was not booed when he won the Scraw Poll
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  They took another year last year where he bit Mitt Romney again, this time he beat him by even more
[37:46.000 --> 37:51.000]  And they stuck a microphone right with the Mitt Romney crowd and had them boo last year
[37:51.000 --> 37:56.000]  This year they got caught trying to do it so it got shut down so they just aired the old tape of Ron Paul being booed last year
[37:56.000 --> 38:03.000]  And since then, I listen to talk radio, I listen to talk radio news, I listen to Fox News on the radio, I listen to all of it
[38:03.000 --> 38:10.000]  And you never hear him talk about Ron Paul even being a contender when he's in first or second poll in Gallup
[38:10.000 --> 38:18.000]  You name it, this is why they have no audience because they don't care, they work for the big military industrial banking complex
[38:18.000 --> 38:25.000]  They took this country over Paul and it's their job to suppress us while the bank steal 28 trillion Bloomberg reported
[38:25.000 --> 38:31.000]  And gut this country, while they put their Obama, EAS, emergency kill switches and all the radio and TV
[38:31.000 --> 38:36.000]  As they announced he's going to start cutting into the media broadcast, as they put 9,000 telescreens in Walmarts
[38:36.000 --> 38:43.000]  Saying spy on your neighbors, if this isn't a police state what is, as the TSA as we told you a decade ago, or nine years ago
[38:43.000 --> 38:49.000]  Rolls out on the streets of America, strip searching children on the side of the highway, this is the federal Gestapo force
[38:49.000 --> 38:55.000]  As three different senators, Jay Rockefeller and others, call for quote ending the internet as we know it
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.000]  As they call for an end to free speech on talk radio with the Ferris Doctrine being reinstituted
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.000]  As they call for FCC regulation of the web and restricting access to our websites
[39:05.000 --> 39:13.000]  The White House regulations, our Cass Sunstein openly comes out Paul and says arrest people that don't believe in man-made global warming or the 9-11th and inside job
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.000]  I mean this is crazy, these people are tyrants, America this is tyranny
[39:17.000 --> 39:21.000]  If you don't recognize that foreign banks have taken our country over and owned the dinosaur media
[39:21.000 --> 39:29.000]  And if you don't realize that there is a desperate gambit by these people, the dinosaur dying media and the government that's being exposed
[39:29.000 --> 39:36.000]  To come together and put in the internet kill switch and start restricting our free speech, you better understand that it's your pocketbook, your pension fund
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.000]  That's going to be the target once they shut the media down, this is real
[39:40.000 --> 39:46.000]  It was in the Ottawa Sun and Associated Press two weeks ago that oh they did sign a North American Union SPP agreement
[39:46.000 --> 39:53.000]  In fact Paul pulled up to read it later and said they're going to have foreign troops patrol America to quote deal with American protestors
[39:53.000 --> 39:58.000]  Foreign troops, foreign troops training to come and take your guns, I've been to the drills
[39:58.000 --> 40:01.000]  The point is now they're announcing it to you all over the news
[40:01.000 --> 40:06.000]  Watson, we're in a fight for the republic, you're in a fight for England, you're in a fight for every free country
[40:06.000 --> 40:11.000]  And if people recognize it and realize the incredible historical position we're in, we can win this thing
[40:11.000 --> 40:17.000]  So I'm glad that I'm the person they dare not speak my name because they know we have a lot of liberty in our hearts and minds
[40:17.000 --> 40:20.000]  And we're setting bushfires everywhere, God bless you Paul Watson
[40:20.000 --> 40:31.000]  Okay, thanks Alex, and yeah, but what's even more dangerous and disconcerting than Fox News and Bill O'Reilly
[40:31.000 --> 40:39.000]  Is the fact that Media Matters, the admitted White House propaganda front group, their own founders admit that's what they are
[40:39.000 --> 40:48.000]  Piggy backed onto this Bill O'Reilly smear and are now using it to ring fence what they define as thought crime
[40:48.000 --> 40:58.000]  Again, using 9-11 and saying it's basically a thought crime, using ideological fascism as a tool with which to attack anyone
[40:58.000 --> 41:07.000]  Who associates with Fox News, which of course, their primary target is somebody who is basically a libertarian, Andrew Napolitano
[41:07.000 --> 41:21.000]  And now in this Media Matters hit piece, they imply that Napolitano is wrong because he agrees with Jones that Obama wants to start a wider global war to expand the empire
[41:21.000 --> 41:29.000]  Again, according to them, that's another thought crime, even as the predator drone strikes accelerate under Obama
[41:29.000 --> 41:38.000]  Even as special forces invade Libya, and even as George Soros, the billionaire globalist who funds Media Matters to the tune of millions of dollars
[41:38.000 --> 41:45.000]  Calls for the Iranian government to be toppled in quote, the bloodiest of revolutions
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.000]  So, you know, when I watched Bill O'Reilly smear Alex Jones, I don't really get that angry
[41:50.000 --> 42:02.000]  He's old media, but he's rapidly losing his influence, he's rapidly becoming irrelevant and he doesn't really try to hide the fact that he's becoming irrelevant
[42:02.000 --> 42:13.000]  But it's the fact that Media Matters hide their propaganda behind this bluster of being non-partisan, you know, legitimate grassroots progressive
[42:13.000 --> 42:20.000]  And do it in a manner as if they're some righteous organization standing up against hateful extremists
[42:20.000 --> 42:28.000]  When in fact, they're funded directly by a dirty globalist who is inciting bloodshed in Iran
[42:28.000 --> 42:36.000]  And their own stated purpose, which they admit to, is to drive home the Obama White House's message and agenda
[42:36.000 --> 42:42.000]  Let's see if Media Matters in their next hit piece will address those statements
[42:42.000 --> 42:48.000]  We'll be back with your calls on the Alex Jones show on this Sunday, March 6th edition
[42:48.000 --> 43:13.000]  Don't go away, PrisonPlanet.tv
[43:19.000 --> 43:26.000]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[43:26.000 --> 43:31.000]  And also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream
[43:31.000 --> 43:35.000]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products
[43:35.000 --> 43:40.000]  You can now produce pure and endless-cloyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator
[43:40.000 --> 43:46.000]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple
[43:46.000 --> 43:53.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator
[43:53.000 --> 43:57.000]  That's www.silverlungs.com
[44:01.000 --> 44:05.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[44:05.000 --> 44:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.000]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[44:17.000 --> 44:19.000]  And they really are calling the shots
[44:19.000 --> 44:24.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.000]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches
[44:38.000 --> 44:41.000]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  Today seems like nobody does care
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.000]  And right now in Washington D.C. we have seen a fall of the Republic
[44:48.000 --> 44:53.000]  Yet you're copy a fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[44:53.000 --> 44:59.000]  We're watching online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv
[44:59.000 --> 45:04.000]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[45:04.000 --> 45:08.000]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[45:08.000 --> 45:14.000]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[45:14.000 --> 45:19.000]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[45:19.000 --> 45:24.000]  Number three, in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[45:28.000 --> 45:31.000]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.000]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[45:35.000 --> 45:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[45:40.000 --> 45:44.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[45:44.000 --> 45:45.000]  One of my oldest sponsors
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.000]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  That's mysolarbackup.com
[45:51.000 --> 45:55.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[45:55.000 --> 45:59.000]  Or call 1-877-327-0365
[45:59.000 --> 46:03.000]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011
[46:03.000 --> 46:07.000]  We will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives
[46:10.000 --> 46:13.000]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  And even how you take care of your health and your own family
[46:15.000 --> 46:18.000]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[46:18.000 --> 46:21.000]  The crazy part is, he's usually right
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM
[46:23.000 --> 46:27.000]  Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[46:30.000 --> 46:33.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  Detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  And it's a real eye-opener
[46:38.000 --> 46:39.000]  I can't stress this enough
[46:39.000 --> 46:42.000]  You should at least watch this free video online today
[46:42.000 --> 46:43.000]  He explains everything you need to know
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[46:46.000 --> 46:51.000]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  That's End of America, the number 3.com
[46:53.000 --> 46:57.000]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.000]  That's End of America 3.com
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[47:04.000 --> 47:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[47:08.000 --> 47:09.000]  Network
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  This is our land
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.000]  These are our people
[47:26.000 --> 47:27.000]  The workers
[47:28.000 --> 47:29.000]  The striders
[47:30.000 --> 47:31.000]  The builders
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  These are our people
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  Who are they?
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  They are the Dark Armies
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  The Dark Murdering Armies
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.000]  Who's only honor is entrusted
[47:47.000 --> 47:51.000]  The answer to 1984
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  Is 1776
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  Paul Joseph Watson filling in for Alex Jones on this Sunday
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  March the 6th edition of the Alex Jones show
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  We're talking about old media versus new media
[48:14.000 --> 48:18.000]  In light of this Bill O'Reilly smear attack on Alex Jones
[48:18.000 --> 48:21.000]  And of course, media matters hijacking it
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  Piggy backing on it
[48:23.000 --> 48:26.000]  To launch their own smear against Alex Jones
[48:26.000 --> 48:31.000]  And since media matters is so keen on identifying thought crimes
[48:31.000 --> 48:35.000]  Which if you merely mentioned them makes you an extremist in their eyes
[48:35.000 --> 48:39.000]  Will it now become a thought crime to point out that media matters
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  And the group that owns it themselves admit
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.000]  That they are not a genuine independent media organization
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  And that they're nothing more than an overly abused whore
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  For the Obama White House
[48:52.000 --> 48:56.000]  I mean, to claim that media matters is a legitimate media outfit
[48:56.000 --> 49:00.000]  Is like claiming that the White House press office
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  Is an independent media outfit
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.000]  I mean, media matters is state media
[49:06.000 --> 49:07.000]  It's a government front
[49:07.000 --> 49:10.000]  They're no better than Chinese state media
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  And in fact, they're worse
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  Because at least Chinese state media doesn't pretend to be anything else
[49:16.000 --> 49:19.000]  I mean, the Obama White House is the pimp
[49:19.000 --> 49:22.000]  And the likes of media matters and think progress are the whores
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  That's why they're constantly attackers
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  They're obsessed with it
[49:27.000 --> 49:30.000]  And if we're so irrelevant as Bill O'Reilly makes out
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  Then why attackers at all?
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  First they ignore you, then they attack you, then you win
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.000]  And judging by the election numbers in comparison with both
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  Bill O'Reilly and media matters
[49:42.000 --> 49:46.000]  There's no doubt that we are winning
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  Henry in Canada, you're on the air
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  Go ahead, Henry
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.000]  Oh, AJ, Infowars.com
[49:55.000 --> 49:58.000]  Setting brush fires in the minds of men
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  That's right, what's on your mind today?
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  I'd be careful about saying that though
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  Because George Soros may get the wrong ideas
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  Think you were talking about arson
[50:08.000 --> 50:11.000]  Exactly, I mean, where the extreme is
[50:11.000 --> 50:14.000]  It's like media matters with the Poplosky smear
[50:14.000 --> 50:18.000]  Which every other independent publication had to retract
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  Indeed, mainstream publications did
[50:20.000 --> 50:24.000]  And media matters failed to do so completely
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  What's on your mind, Henry?
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  I just wanted to say cheerio mate
[50:29.000 --> 50:33.000]  And to leave a message of resistance from Canada
[50:33.000 --> 50:37.000]  Just to say that we're doing banner hangs
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  We're handing out DVDs
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  I woke up a quarter of my high school
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.000]  We're spray painting roads, we're having an effect
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  Good to hear it
[50:47.000 --> 50:51.000]  And we've seen innumerable excellent videos
[50:51.000 --> 50:55.000]  For the V for Victory contest
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  People getting out there
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.000]  Had reports from basically every major country in the world
[51:01.000 --> 51:04.000]  Of people seeing these V for Victory banners
[51:04.000 --> 51:08.000]  And of course, it's all about letting the power elite know
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  That there is a resistance
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  I mean, DHS and Homeland Security
[51:13.000 --> 51:17.000]  And Janet Napolitano see fit to stick their messages up
[51:17.000 --> 51:20.000]  In Walmart and Super Bowl and everywhere else
[51:20.000 --> 51:22.000]  So why shouldn't we?
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  And it's about making them know that we're here
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.000]  And making everyone realize that they're not isolated
[51:29.000 --> 51:32.000]  In this fight in the Info War
[51:32.000 --> 51:35.000]  Thanks to the call, Henry, Ty, in New York
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  You're on the air, go ahead, Ty
[51:37.000 --> 51:40.000]  Yeah, hey Paul, thanks for having me, Carl
[51:40.000 --> 51:43.000]  Yeah, I think when you talk about these groups
[51:43.000 --> 51:46.000]  Again, media matters, Fox News, like you said many times here
[51:46.000 --> 51:49.000]  These are just propaganda outlets
[51:49.000 --> 51:52.000]  So the fact that they're not mentioning what's going on
[51:52.000 --> 51:55.000]  That's part of what they do, they create a reality
[51:55.000 --> 51:58.000]  They don't observe or really report truth
[51:58.000 --> 52:00.000]  And I think that's why they are failing
[52:00.000 --> 52:02.000]  Because they have websites and as you say
[52:02.000 --> 52:05.000]  They have resources, but no one wants to hear it
[52:05.000 --> 52:09.000]  In the sense that people gravitate away from the lies
[52:09.000 --> 52:12.000]  And the way that they're controlling language
[52:12.000 --> 52:14.000]  These are the people that have given us the term
[52:14.000 --> 52:16.000]  Humanitarian warfare
[52:16.000 --> 52:18.000]  What does that even mean?
[52:18.000 --> 52:23.000]  Well, exactly, and I mean, it's not like it's me
[52:23.000 --> 52:26.000]  Saying that media matters is an Obama White House
[52:26.000 --> 52:30.000]  Propaganda front, they admit it, they're proud of it
[52:30.000 --> 52:33.000]  And then in the next breath they say they're non-partisan
[52:33.000 --> 52:37.000]  If you go on sourcewatch.org and type in media matters
[52:37.000 --> 52:41.000]  All the quotes from the people who founded their organization
[52:41.000 --> 52:45.000]  The likes of Jennifer Palmiere and John Podesta
[52:45.000 --> 52:48.000]  And the Center for American Progress
[52:48.000 --> 52:51.000]  They admit that their mission is to carry the domestic
[52:51.000 --> 52:55.000]  And foreign policy agenda of the Obama White House
[52:55.000 --> 52:58.000]  So they're proud of the fact, and you know
[52:58.000 --> 53:01.000]  We see it now with them obsessively attacking us
[53:01.000 --> 53:06.000]  And then George Soros calls for bloody revolution in Iran
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  And then they attack us for saying that Obama
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  Wants to expand the empire
[53:10.000 --> 53:13.000]  So the hypocrisy is unrelenting
[53:13.000 --> 53:16.000]  Anything else on your mind, Ty?
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  Yeah, you know, when it comes to Libya
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.000]  I mean, I'm not surprised about the SAS there at all
[53:22.000 --> 53:26.000]  I'm sure there's a lot of special forces activity from the US
[53:26.000 --> 53:29.000]  Just has to be a fact, even if it's just recon
[53:29.000 --> 53:32.000]  And the fact remains that, you know, I don't know
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  If they're, I mean, they're with the rebels
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  Or they're captured by the rebels, you know
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  If they're being held by rebels
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  Are they not with Qaddafi?
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  I mean, you know, where the loyalty is lying here
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  I mean, the whole thing is just so ambiguous
[53:44.000 --> 53:47.000]  I didn't know if you had any thoughts on that specifically
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  Or, you know, I mean, I just think this whole thing
[53:49.000 --> 53:52.000]  And I haven't got one, sorry, one quick other point is
[53:52.000 --> 53:56.000]  I've seen some footage, but it just doesn't seem to be covered
[53:56.000 --> 53:58.000]  When you hear, but you don't see
[53:58.000 --> 54:01.000]  Egypt was just 24-7, you know, you can see everything
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  Here I don't see much
[54:03.000 --> 54:06.000]  So the whole thing just seems rather ambiguous
[54:06.000 --> 54:09.000]  Well, the thing about the SAS soldiers
[54:09.000 --> 54:12.000]  They've apparently been detained by rebels
[54:12.000 --> 54:16.000]  And the explanation is that some of these rebels
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  Do not want any kind of foreign intervention
[54:19.000 --> 54:23.000]  Because they fear that Qaddafi will seize upon that
[54:23.000 --> 54:28.000]  As evidence that there's a western military intervention
[54:28.000 --> 54:31.000]  Which will then allow him to rally the rest of the population
[54:31.000 --> 54:34.000]  Around patriotic fervour
[54:34.000 --> 54:36.000]  So there's some truth in that
[54:36.000 --> 54:39.000]  But the fact is we reported last week
[54:39.000 --> 54:43.000]  That the SAS, the Special Forces were going in
[54:43.000 --> 54:47.000]  They went in on the 22nd and the 23rd into Benghazi
[54:47.000 --> 54:51.000]  And at the same time there was this whole media debate
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.000]  About should we send in troops for humanitarian aid
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  And they were already in the country for a week
[54:57.000 --> 55:02.000]  And humanitarian aid is certainly becomes more pressing
[55:02.000 --> 55:06.000]  When it involves a country that has the largest oil reserves
[55:06.000 --> 55:09.000]  On the entire continent of Africa
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  Thanks for the call, Tai
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  We're going to go to John in Missouri
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  You're on the edge, John, go ahead
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.000]  Hey, thanks a lot
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.000]  I want to say I woke up a short time ago
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  But ever since then I've been working hard
[55:21.000 --> 55:24.000]  The first thing I want to say to people out there
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  Americans and everybody globally
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  But specifically for the Americans
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  I have to say one thing
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  I pledge allegiance to the flag
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  Of the United States of America
[55:35.000 --> 55:38.000]  And to the republic for which it stands
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  One nation under God
[55:40.000 --> 55:44.000]  Indivisible with liberty and justice for all
[55:44.000 --> 55:47.000]  Area American, I challenge you
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  To say this to yourself
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  Look into the mirror and ask yourself
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.000]  Is the republic going or is it leaving us?
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  We pledge, we made a pledge
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  To the American flag, my people
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  Everyone, we pledge it
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  In our schools we've done this
[56:07.000 --> 56:10.000]  For the beginning of America's start
[56:10.000 --> 56:13.000]  Now this was put in place for a reason
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.000]  I know you're thinking because I used to think a lot
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  What can I do? I'm just one person
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  When I found out the truth it was so overwhelming
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  But this is what I say to you, American people
[56:24.000 --> 56:27.000]  This is what I say to you
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  Say the pledge of allegiance to yourself
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.000]  Act, act, act, organize non-violence
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  Organize non-violence
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  And we're going to start by
[56:39.000 --> 56:42.000]  Going down to the Federal Reserve
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  And that's how we're going to get it done
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  If you agree with me
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.000]  Have any type of ideas?
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  Liberty, justice for all
[56:53.000 --> 56:56.000]  69 at yahoo.com
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  That's Liberty, justice for all
[56:59.000 --> 57:02.000]  69 at yahoo.com
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.000]  Okay, thanks for the call
[57:05.000 --> 57:09.000]  Certainly nobody pledged an allegiance
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  To the US military industrial complex
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  But that's what's leading America
[57:13.000 --> 57:16.000]  That's what's now standing in the place of America
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  As we go forward
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  And certainly when Hillary Clinton
[57:20.000 --> 57:24.000]  Bemoaned the fact that the United States
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  Was losing the information war
[57:26.000 --> 57:31.000]  She certainly didn't mean the United States
[57:31.000 --> 57:34.000]  That was founded by the founding fathers
[57:34.000 --> 57:39.000]  She means the US military industrial complex
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  And that's going to wrap it up
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  For today's Alex Jones show
[57:43.000 --> 57:46.000]  On this Sunday, March the 6th edition
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  Hopefully Alex will be back
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  In the hot seat tomorrow
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  Alex told you the government announced
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  Recently that the recession is over
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  It ended on June of 2009
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  The millions of Americans unable to find work
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  Might not agree
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers
[58:02.000 --> 58:03.000]  And government employees
[58:03.000 --> 58:04.000]  But for the rest of us
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  Things seemed to be getting worse
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  They've begun their long expected journey
[58:10.000 --> 58:11.000]  To the moon
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars
[58:13.000 --> 58:14.000]  Into gold and silver
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  You should consider a food savings account
[58:16.000 --> 58:17.000]  From eFoods Direct
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  They both make fabulous investments
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  Food is our greatest dependency
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  And we know it will be more precious
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  Than any financial resource
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis
[58:27.000 --> 58:30.000]  And you can't eat paper, stocks or metals
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  Alex has been urging you to invest
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  In delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  Or save for long term
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  This will freeze the cost of your food
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  While you can still afford it
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com on the internet
[58:41.000 --> 58:44.000]  Or call 800-409-5633

[58:46.000 --> 58:51.000]  Or 800-409-5633
[59:16.000 --> 59:18.000]  The continuity of government program
[59:18.000 --> 59:20.000]  Has established an old powerful shadow state
[59:20.000 --> 59:23.000]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths
[59:23.000 --> 59:25.000]  To which our republic has fallen
[59:25.000 --> 59:27.000]  Repair to enter the secret of world
[59:27.000 --> 59:29.000]  Of emergency dictatorship
[59:29.000 --> 59:32.000]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies
[59:32.000 --> 59:35.000]  Stage terror and cameras on every street corner
[59:35.000 --> 59:38.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan
[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  The police state isn't coming
[59:40.000 --> 59:41.000]  It's here

[59:51.000 --> 59:54.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[59:54.000 --> 59:58.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[1:00:02.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  From his Central Texas Command Center
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:06.000]  Deep behind enemy lines
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  The information war continues
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:18.000]  Well, it's a big religious holiday
[1:00:18.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  Here in the United States
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  And it's been exported around the world
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  And I'm committing a form of sacrilege
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  On this holy day of the Super Bowl
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  I'm here actually talking about
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  What's happening in the world
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  And how our constitutional republic
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  And our hard-won liberties
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  Are being circumvented and eroded
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  And basically decimated
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  We are live
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  It is the holy day
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  Of the 6th of February, 2011
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  When the two tribal champions
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Are set to face each other
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  In an hour and a half
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  In global warming, ravaged Dallas
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:05.000]  Where the hospitals don't have power
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  Off and on, but the Cowboys Stadium
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000]  The religious temple does
[1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:12.000]  The religious temple of distraction
[1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  And diversion from real issues
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  Hey, we're going into a depression
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:18.000]  Our children have no future
[1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  But we get to have pat-downs by the TSA
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  Oh, that's right, they're there
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  Running things
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  And we get to be spied on
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  And the army is involved
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  As we're bathed in tyranny
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  What's good for third world police states
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:34.000]  What's good for fictitious 1984s
[1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  Why it's good for America
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  And we're going to be going over
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  All of that today
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  Homeland security secretary
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  Inspects, she's our right-fewer
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  The borders are wide open
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:50.000]  But she inspects to make sure
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.000]  We're safe, aren't we glad
[1:01:52.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  That Mrs. Napolitano, excuse me
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  Mr. Napolitano, like Mr. Maddow
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  Are there to inspect us
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000]  And train us to have government
[1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Put their hands down our pants
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:06.000]  To protect us from the evil terrorist
[1:02:06.000 --> 1:02:08.000]  We're so lucky they're there
[1:02:08.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  To protect the foreign banks
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  Stealing tens of trillions
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000]  And not just our children's birthright
[1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  But our futures
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  She's there inserting herself
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  At the publicity trough
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  Like the fat demonic government hog
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:22.000]  That she is
[1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  They're training us to not trust anyone
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:28.000]  But the government, the last group in the world
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:30.000]  Security secretary inspects Super Bowl
[1:02:30.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  Sites as fans have shared responsibility
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  It's a responsibility
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  To spy on each other and watch each other
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  Because of our CIA boogeyman
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  Hiding in every jack-in-the-box
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  Here in the homeland
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:48.000]  Continuing big sis in the NFL
[1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  Turned Super Bowl into police state
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  We've got some of her announcements coming up
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  And here's the Fort Worth Star Telegram
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:58.000]  The 100,000 plus minions
[1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Paying hundreds of dollars a piece to get in
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  And watch a bunch of people engage
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  In simulated combat
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  They get to have the government grab their genitals
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  And their children will be grabbed, of course
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  And be baptized into humiliation
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  And third world tyranny
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  And learn how to be loaded onto the FEMA trucks
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  And taken to that facility
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  As the government trains the military for that
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  T.S. Sample Keep an eye on the Super Bowl
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  For everyone's safety
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  CNN reported this first in 2009
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  And it's a three-year tradition
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  They're now doing it yet again here
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:34.000]  So obviously today
[1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  We are going to be covering
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  This report for you
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  And going over it
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  Because I saw some other reports here
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:48.000]  Talking about what a great American pastime it is
[1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  That Americans don't have jobs anymore
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.000]  And that the Steelers don't have steel mills anymore
[1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  But that people give pints of blood
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  To get the money they need
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  They give their blood all year
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  And save up the money to be able to go to the game
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.000]  They have no country, they have no industry
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000]  They have no Bill of Rights and Constitution
[1:04:08.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  But CNN says, you know what?
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  They can go field pride
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  Through the overpaid steroid heads
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  On the field that when they're not gang-banging
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  Or fighting dogs to death
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  Or running around cussing on national TV
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  They're there, keeping us safe
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  So it's just wonderful
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  Of course, there's nothing wrong with the football game
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  And I admire obviously athletes
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  But things have swung too far the other way
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  On the pendulum
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  And we need to realize that
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  We need to have some priorities here
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  On this religious holiday
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  Now I haven't gotten to the really big news yet
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  But I will get to that
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  I never thought I'd see the White House
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  On their front page
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  Respond to a prisonplata.com article
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  But they've done just that
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  We'll tell you about it straight ahead
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:27.000]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  I'm looking for America
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  Wear American and be proud
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  Land on a free and home of the brave
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  Seems like I just woke up one day
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  And it was gone
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  And I'm gone
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.000]  But I know in my heart it's still there
[1:05:54.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America today
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  I'm doing a live radio broadcast during the holiest day of the year
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:28.000]  We don't really find God to be holier important anymore
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  Or the family
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:30.000]  Or our test scores
[1:06:30.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  Or our health
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  Or our bill of rights and constitution
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:34.000]  Or our dollar
[1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  It's all in decline
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:38.000]  A usurped, captured country
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  Taken over by the foreign offshore central banks
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  But we've got our Super Bowl
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  That roughly 70 million Americans
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  Are going to tune into today
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.000]  And kick off is in an hour and 25 minutes
[1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  In the global warming ravaged Cowboys Stadium
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:02.000]  With collapsing tents from snow
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  And hospitals not having power
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  But believe me, the holy temple
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:14.000]  The taxpayer paid for a temple to Jerry Jones
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  It is standing there
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  And Homeland security in 9,000 locations
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:20.000]  Putting in telescreens
[1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000]  Ordering you to spy on your neighbors
[1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000]  On other shoppers
[1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  People are paranoidly calling the police at Walmart
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:28.000]  Where they're putting these in
[1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000]  Repeatedly for having cell phones
[1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  Talking on them
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:34.000]  We're learning that land of the free home of the brave
[1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  Means being more Soviet than East Germany
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Being more 1984 than Big Brother
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  And Fort Worth Telegram is reporting
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:46.000]  The TSA is running things
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:48.000]  Not just airports
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  They've announced nationwide
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:50.000]  Warrantless checkpoints
[1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  They have you and your family
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:54.000]  Drive under super high powered X-ray scanners
[1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  In fact, they have a news clip on that
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  They don't worry about the TSA workers
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  Being fried by the radiation
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  Doing it daily
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  Or the citizens driving under it
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:06.000]  The government waves a magic wand
[1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:08.000]  Just like they did 20 years ago
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:09.000]  Telling US troops
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:12.000]  You can now use depleted uranium munitions
[1:08:12.000 --> 1:08:14.000]  The Army's own reports on it admit
[1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  That you get one whiff of it
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  It will reduce your life expectancy
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  By about a third
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:22.000]  But hey, what's a young 20-year-old breathing it
[1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  Dying when he's 45 instead of 75
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  Hey, it's freedom
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  Hey, haven't TSA trained goons
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  Stick their hands down your 5-year-old's pants
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  At the Super Bowl
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:34.000]  That's freedom
[1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000]  That's freedom to keep you safe
[1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  From the vicious al-Qaeda
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  And so I will be getting into
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:44.000]  The Super Bowl religion today
[1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  And I will commit the ultimate sacrilege
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  The ultimate abomination of evil
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  I will actually talk about
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  What really made this country great
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  The Bill of Rights, the Constitution
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  The Declaration of Independence
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  And the fact that that's been eroded
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  By design
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:06.000]  And I will talk about the dollar devaluation
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:08.000]  And the attacks on liberty in our country
[1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:10.000]  During the last 30 minutes of the broadcast today
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000]  I may even commit a bigger abomination
[1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  And read the Bill of Rights and Constitution
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  Or parts of it on air
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  During this holy day
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  Where we know all about the football scores
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:24.000]  And you try to go to the store
[1:09:24.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  And pay for gas
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:28.000]  Or go to the grocery store
[1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:30.000]  Everybody wants to talk to you about the big game
[1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  But if you bring up to them
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:34.000]  Loss of sovereignty
[1:09:34.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  Or dollar devaluation
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:36.000]  Or hyperinflation
[1:09:36.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  Or the police state being set up
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  For the Patriot Act
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  They look at you like you're a crazy man
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:44.000]  That's right
[1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:46.000]  Well, I'm a crazy man
[1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  You see, I actually care about liberty and freedom
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  And see a lot of people think that liberty and freedom
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  Is like some nebulous thing
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  That it's only activists that care about it
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  Well, when you've had freedom so long
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  It's almost like
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  The country doesn't have an autoimmune system
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  Here's a parallel
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  Or a parable
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  Based in history
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  500 years ago roughly
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  When Europeans showed up
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  In the new world
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  Native Americans
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  Or the indigenous populations
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:22.000]  Had never come in contact with
[1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  Smallpox
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:26.000]  And so
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:28.000]  What would only kill a fraction of Europeans
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:30.000]  That came in contact with it
[1:10:30.000 --> 1:10:32.000]  Because they developed immunity over generations
[1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  Or those that were susceptible had died
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:38.000]  Those that weren't susceptible had passed on their genes
[1:10:38.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  When the Europeans arrived
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  Millions, it's estimated, of natives
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  From what is South America
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  Central America, Mexico
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:48.000]  And of course
[1:10:48.000 --> 1:10:50.000]  Further north into North America
[1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  All the way up into Alaska
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000]  With the Inuit Eskimos
[1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  Millions and millions died
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  Because they'd never experienced smallpox
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  And that's kind of what Americans are like
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  We've never really experienced hardcore tyranny
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:06.000]  We've had the incredible birthright
[1:11:06.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  That our forebearers fought and died for
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  And so now hardcore, systematic, admitted
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  Primaphasia, tyranny
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:16.000]  And corruption is here
[1:11:16.000 --> 1:11:18.000]  And a lot of people are getting a little concerned
[1:11:18.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  And waking up
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:22.000]  But they still don't know how serious it is
[1:11:22.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  And so, tyranny is so alien
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:29.000]  Hardcore, systematic, Nazi or Soviet-style oppression
[1:11:29.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  Is so alien that now that it's clearly
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  Manifesting itself and transcending political parties
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  It's the bureaucracy and the ruling
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  Political class that's the problem
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  You know, the parties are just different
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  Different chapters of the same organism
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  That we are in deep, deep trouble
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  Let me give you an example of tyranny
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  You see, if you have an all-powerful government
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  That can do whatever it wants
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  So there's no bill of rights, no constitution
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  No separation of powers
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  And you have an executive that can do whatever they want
[1:12:01.000 --> 1:12:03.000]  It doesn't matter if Congress didn't pass
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  The Kyoto-UN protocol last year
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  Or the last five times before that
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  They tried to ratify it going back into the early 2000s
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  But now under tyranny, the president can just order
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  The EPA to go around the country
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:22.000]  And he's done it in the last two years
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  Shutting off power plants in Kansas, South Dakota, Georgia,
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  North Carolina, and Texas and many other states
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  And then, have you noticed all over the country
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  Your power prices have gone up?
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:36.000]  Might have roughly doubled in the last two years
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:38.000]  In Austin, and Austin Energy admits
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  That that's part of their target to cut carbon
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  Is charging you more money
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  Of course, those are privately owned companies
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:48.000]  That they're involved with and they're making big profits
[1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  And it did come out this week that Obama is putting
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:54.000]  Even more greenhouse gas tax limits
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  And controls on plants except for General Electric
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  Which is the biggest builder of the coal-powered plants
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  In this country and worldwide
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  They get a waiver on the plants they build
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:08.000]  And the plants that they own
[1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:10.000]  Do you think when folks want to invest now
[1:13:10.000 --> 1:13:12.000]  They're going to invest with General Electric?
[1:13:12.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  Total mafia
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  And it has nothing to do with the rising seas
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:20.000]  And oh my gosh, carbon dioxide is going to kill us
[1:13:20.000 --> 1:13:24.000]  It has everything to do with selective enforcement
[1:13:24.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  Just like I've talked a lot about
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  And of course, who's the new head of the economic board
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  That makes all these decisions?
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  The former head of General Electric
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:36.000]  Is now the head of Obama's administration
[1:13:36.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  When it comes to economic situations
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:42.000]  And of course, you have seen the 500-plus waivers
[1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  And counting given out to major global corporations
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:48.000]  They don't have to get health insurance
[1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:50.000]  But your company does
[1:13:50.000 --> 1:13:52.000]  Another unfair trade advantage
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  See, Obama's not a liberal
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.000]  He's not a conservative
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:56.000]  He's not a communist
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  No, he is a corporate frontman
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  There to make you think
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  There's a difference between the two major parties
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  So that we'll all fight with each other
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  And like a football game
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  Choose what party we're part of
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:10.000]  And so basically the parties can act
[1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:12.000]  Like they're fighting with each other
[1:14:12.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  But move the ball down the field
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.000]  Against we, the people
[1:14:16.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  And so now if you wonder why
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  Your apartment bill on average was 200 bucks
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  And now it's 400 on average
[1:14:23.000 --> 1:14:26.000]  Or you wonder why your house bill was 500 on average
[1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  Is now 1200
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:28.000]  Well, understand
[1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  That's because they've shut down power plants
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:32.000]  All over the country
[1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  And they've restricted plants
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  From increasing their power output
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Or expanding
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:38.000]  And big mega corporations
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  Have bought up smaller city-owned utilities
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  Like the old Holly Street in Austin
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:44.000]  That could supply about half the city
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:46.000]  And shut it down
[1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  Automatically making their profits go up
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  Because there's less energy
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  You know, Hugo Chavez
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  They have more oil than the U.S.
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  You know, per capita, per square mile
[1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:57.000]  They have more coal
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  But they don't have power half the time
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:02.000]  He does that because it's how he controls the population
[1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:04.000]  And that's why we've had rolling blackouts
[1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  All over the country
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  And that's not just my opinion
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  The Heritage Foundation
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  Has done an analysis
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:12.000]  Concurring
[1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:14.000]  And sourcing our report
[1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  Anti-energy agenda
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:18.000]  Could cause more rolling blackouts
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:20.000]  Now, here's the big news of the day
[1:15:20.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  We're going to get into this
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  When we come back from the break
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  Last night
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  I was on one of my Facebook accounts
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  Just checking it for any news tips
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  And I saw a link at the top
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  White House
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:35.000]  You can't believe everything you read
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:38.000]  And the White House Communications Director
[1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  Dan Pfeiffer attacked our story from Thursday
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  That Fox, Drudge, and Limbaugh
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  All covered on Friday
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  And said, basically, we're liars
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:50.000]  That Obama didn't cause the blackouts
[1:15:50.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  We're going to talk about that
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:54.000]  Oh, yeah, never thought I'd live to see it
[1:15:54.000 --> 1:16:19.000]  And the White House now responding to President Blana.com
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:27.000]  And now, new socialist legislation
[1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000]  Is only compounding the problem
[1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:30.000]  Number four
[1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:34.000]  Every year, thousands of families
[1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:36.000]  Lose their power from weather-related onages
[1:16:36.000 --> 1:16:37.000]  Number five
[1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  A solar power generator
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:40.000]  Provides powerful backup insurance
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:41.000]  And peace of mind
[1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:45.000]  Offered by Solutions from Science
[1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:46.000]  One of my old sponsors

[1:17:58.000 --> 1:17:59.000]  Thank you
[1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:03.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny
[1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:05.000]  In the last century alone
[1:18:05.000 --> 1:18:08.000]  This is our last chance to not relive history
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:10.000]  As we're finishing off this agenda
[1:18:10.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:13.000]  Americans at home
[1:18:13.000 --> 1:18:15.000]  We have a tremendous influence
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  On our president and Congress
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:19.000]  And they really are calling the shots
[1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:25.000]  As American citizens to pay attention
[1:18:25.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:30.000]  The criminal offshore cartel
[1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000]  Hell bent on destroying sovereignty
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  And on its ashes constructing world government
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:37.000]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists
[1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  They're asking for more matches
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:40.000]  And the Congress is saying
[1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  Who do we make the checkout to?
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.000]  Today seems like nobody does care
[1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:45.000]  And right now in Washington, D.C.
[1:18:45.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  We have seen a fall of the Republic
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:50.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic
[1:18:50.000 --> 1:18:53.000]  On DVD at infowars.com

[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:29.000]  They both make fabulous investments
[1:19:29.000 --> 1:19:31.000]  Food is our greatest dependency
[1:19:31.000 --> 1:19:33.000]  And we know it will be more precious
[1:19:33.000 --> 1:19:35.000]  Than any financial resource
[1:19:35.000 --> 1:19:37.000]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis
[1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  And you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:42.000]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious
[1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  Easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  This will freeze the cost of your food
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:49.000]  While you can still afford it
[1:19:49.000 --> 1:19:51.000]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet
[1:19:51.000 --> 1:19:54.000]  Or call 800-409-5633
[1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:56.000]  That's efoodsdirect.com
[1:19:56.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  Or 800-409-5633
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:04.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[1:20:04.000 --> 1:20:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[1:20:25.000 --> 1:20:35.000]  We measure how much national television covers
[1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:38.000]  Every week the Drudge Report links to us
[1:20:38.000 --> 1:20:41.000]  Or the New York Times or Newsweek blurbs
[1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:44.000]  What we're doing and basically attacks us
[1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  In those cases
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  George Soros own media outlets like Media Matters
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  Attack us almost on a daily basis
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:55.000]  And it shows the big effect we're having
[1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:57.000]  A year ago it came out in major newspapers
[1:20:57.000 --> 1:21:01.000]  That I am on the top 30 White House enemies list
[1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  As number 29
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:07.000]  And that's because I oppose the policies
[1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  Of this treasonous administration
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:12.000]  And I've made a 15 minute video
[1:21:12.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  That's up on infowars.com
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  And prisonplanet.com
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  Where I lay out the evidence of treason
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  When they put economic policies in place
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:23.000]  To ship our jobs to China
[1:21:23.000 --> 1:21:28.000]  And to fund China building three to five coal plants a week
[1:21:28.000 --> 1:21:30.000]  But we can't have three new ones a year
[1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:33.000]  Attacking our very energy infrastructure is treason
[1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:38.000]  And when only allowing insiders who finance presidential runs
[1:21:38.000 --> 1:21:41.000]  Of people like Obama to operate power plants in the country
[1:21:41.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  That's another form of mafia style tyranny
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:48.000]  But Thursday, Paul Watson and I wrote an article
[1:21:48.000 --> 1:21:53.000]  Obama blocking of new power plants triggers nationwide blackouts
[1:21:53.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  And Obama triggers blackouts became the number one
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:01.000]  Google search term on Thursday into Friday
[1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  Fox News picked it up
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:06.000]  The Drudge Report picked it up
[1:22:06.000 --> 1:22:08.000]  Rush Limbaugh covered the story
[1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:13.000]  And then on Friday, Media Matters
[1:22:13.000 --> 1:22:16.000]  The George Soros funded group ran the headline
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:20.000]  And Fox turns to 9-11 Truther and conspiracy theorist
[1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:24.000]  Alex Jones for content
[1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:26.000]  And of course Soros basically was one of the biggest
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:28.000]  Backers of Obama and many of his minions
[1:22:28.000 --> 1:22:31.000]  Actually are in cabinet positions in the White House
[1:22:31.000 --> 1:22:34.000]  What I didn't notice until I was alerted to it yesterday
[1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:38.000]  Afternoon is that on the front page of White House.gov
[1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:41.000]  It's still on the front page
[1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:42.000]  Saturday it was still at the top
[1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:45.000]  It's moved to the bottom left-hand corner of White House.gov
[1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:49.000]  There it is, White House Communications Director Press Release
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:54.000]  You can't believe everything you read by Dan Pfeiffer
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:57.000]  The White House Communications Director
[1:22:57.000 --> 1:23:00.000]  And they go on to say you can't believe everything you read
[1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000]  Really, Obama said he wouldn't have signing statements
[1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:06.000]  And has signed more per capita than Bush or Clinton
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:08.000]  Or any other president
[1:23:08.000 --> 1:23:11.000]  Obama promised to not have bank or fat cats in his administration
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:14.000]  He's got the biggest group of bank or fat cats
[1:23:14.000 --> 1:23:16.000]  Anybody we've ever seen
[1:23:16.000 --> 1:23:17.000]  He promised to balance the budget
[1:23:17.000 --> 1:23:19.000]  He spent more than all presidents before him combined
[1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:22.000]  I mean everybody knows Obama's been a big liar
[1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:25.000]  A big liar across the board to try to chronicle those
[1:23:25.000 --> 1:23:26.000]  Makes my head spin
[1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.000]  But you can think of a lot of the lies yourself
[1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:31.000]  But you can't believe everything you read
[1:23:31.000 --> 1:23:35.000]  What a headline they've got here
[1:23:35.000 --> 1:23:38.000]  And I'm going to go ahead and read over some of this article
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:41.000]  And then I'm going to get into our rebuttal
[1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:43.000]  That Paul Watson and I put together last night
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.000]  White House attacks prisonplanet.com
[1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:47.000]  Report on blackouts
[1:23:47.000 --> 1:23:50.000]  And this thing is so well sourced, so documented
[1:23:50.000 --> 1:23:54.000]  And doubly proves everything that we documented
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.000]  In our original article from Thursday
[1:23:56.000 --> 1:23:58.000]  Obama's blocking of new power plants
[1:23:58.000 --> 1:24:00.000]  Triggers nationwide blackouts
[1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.000]  Furious hospitals hit with outages
[1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:07.000]  While post-industrial collapse of America accelerates
[1:24:07.000 --> 1:24:12.000]  But going over this White House front page press release
[1:24:12.000 --> 1:24:18.000]  And is the media, the lapdog media going to
[1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000]  Challenge Obama on this?
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:24.000]  Because this breaks every rule of journalism right here
[1:24:24.000 --> 1:24:27.000]  As valuable as the internet can be
[1:24:27.000 --> 1:24:29.000]  In helping to spread information
[1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:32.000]  Most people know that you can't believe everything you read
[1:24:32.000 --> 1:24:34.000]  Especially how do you know when a politician's lying
[1:24:34.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  Their lips are moving
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:37.000]  This is the same White House with their regulations are
[1:24:37.000 --> 1:24:40.000]  Cass Sunstein on record putting out policy papers
[1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.000]  Saying arrest people that question
[1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:43.000]  Man-made global warming
[1:24:43.000 --> 1:24:45.000]  He's on record
[1:24:45.000 --> 1:24:47.000]  And they want the kill switch
[1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:50.000]  Oh, they really know how valuable the internet is
[1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:53.000]  Every line is spin and deception
[1:24:53.000 --> 1:24:55.000]  So it'll take a while to go over this press release
[1:24:55.000 --> 1:24:57.000]  I'm sorry, every line is a fraud
[1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:59.000]  As valuable as the internet can be
[1:24:59.000 --> 1:25:01.000]  In helping to spread information
[1:25:01.000 --> 1:25:04.000]  Most people know that if you can't believe everything you read
[1:25:04.000 --> 1:25:09.000]  And they should check the source before relying
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  And relaying every alarming story they read
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:14.000]  But here's the problem
[1:25:14.000 --> 1:25:16.000]  They then don't give a link to the source
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:17.000]  They're trying to discredit
[1:25:17.000 --> 1:25:19.000]  They don't even tell you who it is
[1:25:19.000 --> 1:25:23.000]  Alex Jones via Matt Drudge, Rush Limbaugh, Fox News
[1:25:23.000 --> 1:25:25.000]  So right there they say
[1:25:25.000 --> 1:25:28.000]  We love the internet when they're actually trying to take over
[1:25:28.000 --> 1:25:30.000]  The free web on record
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:34.000]  Then they go on and say you should check the source
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:36.000]  But they don't give you the source
[1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:38.000]  I'm about to get to that
[1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:41.000]  Every line is a deception
[1:25:41.000 --> 1:25:43.000]  Did the devil write this?
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:46.000]  Literally, everything in here is a lie
[1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:50.000]  All one, two, three, four, five, six paragraphs
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:52.000]  Every line is a lie
[1:25:52.000 --> 1:25:56.000]  Some lines of this have multiple lies per line
[1:25:56.000 --> 1:25:59.000]  How do you counter something like this?
[1:25:59.000 --> 1:26:02.000]  Well, we have in the article by Alex Jones
[1:26:02.000 --> 1:26:03.000]  And Paul Joseph Watson
[1:26:03.000 --> 1:26:05.000]  But I'm going to get to that in a moment
[1:26:05.000 --> 1:26:08.000]  Continuing, you can't believe everything you read
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:11.000]  I think that's the only true statement in here
[1:26:11.000 --> 1:26:13.000]  As valuable as the internet can be
[1:26:13.000 --> 1:26:15.000]  In helping spread information
[1:26:15.000 --> 1:26:17.000]  Most people know that you can't believe everything you read
[1:26:17.000 --> 1:26:20.000]  And they should check the source before relying
[1:26:20.000 --> 1:26:23.000]  And relaying every alarming story they read
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:26.000]  One such story is going around the internet
[1:26:26.000 --> 1:26:28.000]  Over the past two days
[1:26:28.000 --> 1:26:32.000]  Claiming that the Obama administration is somehow responsible
[1:26:32.000 --> 1:26:35.000]  For the rolling blackouts in Texas
[1:26:35.000 --> 1:26:37.000]  By the way, they're all over the country
[1:26:37.000 --> 1:26:39.000]  From California to Arizona
[1:26:39.000 --> 1:26:41.000]  Our article says that, by the way
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:43.000]  So that's another lie, it's not just Texas
[1:26:43.000 --> 1:26:46.000]  That have caused terrible hardship for so many Texans
[1:26:46.000 --> 1:26:48.000]  I guess that's a little vein of truth there too
[1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:50.000]  That has caused hardship
[1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.000]  The source is questionable
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  And the story is unquestionably false
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:56.000]  But they do not give a source
[1:26:56.000 --> 1:26:58.000]  They do not give a source
[1:26:58.000 --> 1:27:00.000]  They just got done in the line before saying
[1:27:00.000 --> 1:27:02.000]  This is...
[1:27:02.000 --> 1:27:04.000]  In our article, every line has links
[1:27:04.000 --> 1:27:07.000]  To mainstream and government admissions
[1:27:07.000 --> 1:27:09.000]  But with them, they don't give any links
[1:27:09.000 --> 1:27:11.000]  But one to the Houston Chronicle
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:14.000]  According to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:16.000]  These blackouts were actually the result
[1:27:16.000 --> 1:27:18.000]  Of extreme cold temperatures and high winds
[1:27:18.000 --> 1:27:21.000]  Which led to a variety of mechanical failures
[1:27:21.000 --> 1:27:23.000]  At more than 50 plants around the state
[1:27:23.000 --> 1:27:26.000]  Let's stop right there
[1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:29.000]  That's another giant, huge, stinking
[1:27:29.000 --> 1:27:31.000]  Straw man, what's a straw man?
[1:27:31.000 --> 1:27:33.000]  They don't attack what we really said
[1:27:33.000 --> 1:27:35.000]  They build a line
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:37.000]  Our article obviously says
[1:27:37.000 --> 1:27:39.000]  The cold weather taxed the power plants
[1:27:39.000 --> 1:27:41.000]  And because we haven't built enough of them
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:43.000]  We've had outages
[1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:45.000]  And then we link to all the white paper
[1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:47.000]  And think tank reports stating
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:49.000]  That we're in a power deficit compared to China
[1:27:49.000 --> 1:27:52.000]  And others for our basic industrial needs
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.000]  Not to mention just general
[1:27:54.000 --> 1:27:56.000]  So see the bait and switch there
[1:27:56.000 --> 1:27:59.000]  Talking to you like your five-year-old children
[1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  Saying, oh, this unreputable source
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.000]  That we're not going to let you link to
[1:28:04.000 --> 1:28:06.000]  So you can make up your own mind and actually read
[1:28:06.000 --> 1:28:08.000]  This unreputable source, just trust us
[1:28:08.000 --> 1:28:10.000]  We're not going to put a link to them
[1:28:10.000 --> 1:28:12.000]  Or even say who they are
[1:28:12.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  They're saying that
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:16.000]  And I noticed that was their counter
[1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:18.000]  In media matters, George Soros
[1:28:18.000 --> 1:28:21.000]  Their counter in a whole bunch of other newspapers
[1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:23.000]  That did attack us by name
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.000]  As the surrogates of the White House
[1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:28.000]  They said, Jones and the other lunatic writers
[1:28:28.000 --> 1:28:31.000]  Said Obama flipped a switch and turned the power off
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:34.000]  When everyone knows it was cold weather
[1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:36.000]  No, we said cold weather hit
[1:28:36.000 --> 1:28:38.000]  And because we haven't built enough power plants
[1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:41.000]  That there were huge power outages all over the country
[1:28:41.000 --> 1:28:44.000]  Then they only say we said it was in Texas
[1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:46.000]  I'm going to continue here
[1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:49.000]  But see, this is the type of deception
[1:28:49.000 --> 1:28:52.000]  The trained liars that we're dealing with
[1:28:52.000 --> 1:28:54.000]  We're going to go over these lies one by one
[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.000]  Then I'm getting into the Super Bowl
[1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:58.000]  Where they're sticking their hands down people's pants
[1:29:00.000 --> 1:29:03.000]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting
[1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:06.000]  That in 2011, we will witness the most important day
[1:29:06.000 --> 1:29:08.000]  In America in more than 50 years
[1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:11.000]  He says it will change everything about our lives
[1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:14.000]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children
[1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000]  And even how you take care of your health and your own family
[1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:19.000]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years
[1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:22.000]  The crazy part is, he's usually right
[1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:24.000]  But see, he predicted the collapse of GM
[1:29:24.000 --> 1:29:27.000]  Danny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:28.000]  General Growth Properties
[1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:31.000]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy
[1:29:31.000 --> 1:29:34.000]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free
[1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:37.000]  Detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet
[1:29:37.000 --> 1:29:39.000]  And it's a real eye-opener
[1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:40.000]  I can't stress this enough
[1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:43.000]  You should at least watch this free video online today
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:45.000]  He explains everything you need to know
[1:29:45.000 --> 1:29:47.000]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself
[1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:51.000]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:54.000]  That's End of America, the number 3.com
[1:29:54.000 --> 1:29:58.000]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com
[1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:27.000]  That's End of America 3.com

[1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:31.000]  Or www.InfoWars.com
[1:30:31.000 --> 1:30:33.000]  Let's talk to the owner of Five Star Soap
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:31:01.000]  Marty Schachter and see what he has to say
[1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:05.000]  Third, Alex explains how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[1:31:05.000 --> 1:31:08.000]  With your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:11.000]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System
[1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:16.000]  And how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body
[1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:21.000]  My name is Mario Safaldi, and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator
[1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:25.000]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[1:31:25.000 --> 1:31:29.000]  It also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed
[1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:33.000]  To deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:41.000]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system
[1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:45.000]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System
[1:31:45.000 --> 1:31:49.000]  At www.SilverLungs.com
[1:31:49.000 --> 1:31:52.000]  To learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works

[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:28.000]  The Silver Lungs System is only compounding the problem
[1:32:28.000 --> 1:32:29.000]  Number 4
[1:32:29.000 --> 1:32:31.000]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages
[1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:36.000]  Number 5
[1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:40.000]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:44.000]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:45.000]  One of my oldest sponsors
[1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:49.000]  You can get more information at www.MySolarBackup.com
[1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:51.000]  That's MySolarBackup.com
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:53.000]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun
[1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:59.000]  So go to www.MySolarBackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:05.000]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin
[1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:09.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:37.000]  Music
[1:33:37.000 --> 1:33:42.000]  White House AttacksPrisonPlanet.com reports on blackouts
[1:33:42.000 --> 1:33:47.000]  Again, White House AttacksPrisonPlanet.com reports on blackouts
[1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:51.000]  Sutted media matters, George Soros outfit
[1:33:51.000 --> 1:33:55.000]  And they just tell lie after lie in this piece we're going through here
[1:33:55.000 --> 1:34:01.000]  Anytime communities experience major outages
[1:34:01.000 --> 1:34:09.000]  It is a cause for concern and major utilities and regulators are investigating steps that can be taken to decrease
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:14.000]  Any weather-related vulnerability of power generating plants in the state
[1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:18.000]  Unlike their northern counterparts, which experience extreme cold every winter
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:24.000]  And often are not designed to withstand such rare weather conditions
[1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  So they go on to claim that we're having power outages by the way
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:30.000]  From, again, New York to California
[1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:33.000]  Because they don't experience regular cold
[1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:36.000]  And they're implying that we're only talking about Texas here
[1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:41.000]  When it's Texas that's supplying much of Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and surrounding states power
[1:34:41.000 --> 1:34:44.000]  Biggest power producer in the country
[1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:51.000]  I mean, we have the clips of Obama saying that he wants to bankrupt coal plants
[1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:55.000]  That you can build one, but they're going to put carbon taxes on you so high
[1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:56.000]  That it's going to bankrupt you
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:35:00.000]  In fact, we have that clip. Let's go ahead and roll that clip now
[1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:05.000]  It's only 13 seconds for folks. Here it is
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:11.000]  Use coal without emitting greenhouse gases and carbon
[1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:15.000]  And how can we sequester that carbon and capture it?
[1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:22.000]  If we can't, then we're going to still be working on alternatives
[1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:27.000]  But...
[1:35:27.000 --> 1:35:31.000]  Let me sort of describe my overall policy
[1:35:31.000 --> 1:35:37.000]  What I've said is that we would put a cap and trade system in place that is as aggressive
[1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:40.000]  If not more aggressive than anybody else's out there
[1:35:40.000 --> 1:35:44.000]  I was the first to call for 100% auction on the cap and trade system
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:49.000]  Which means that every unit of carbon or greenhouse gases was emitted
[1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:52.000]  Would be charged to the polluter
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:58.000]  That will create a market in which whatever technologies are out there to be presented
[1:35:58.000 --> 1:36:00.000]  Whatever power plants that are being built
[1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:04.000]  That they would have to meet the rigors of that market
[1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:10.000]  And the ratcheted down caps that are placed imposed every year
[1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000]  So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:18.000]  It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum
[1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:22.000]  For all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted
[1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:29.000]  That will also generate billions of dollars that we can invest in solar, wind, biodiesel
[1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:32.000]  By the way, solar supplies 1% of the United States
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:35.000]  And I looked up the Fed's admitted numbers
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:42.000]  It cost 10 times as much money for every megawatt of wind power that you get compared to coal
[1:36:42.000 --> 1:36:45.000]  Then they go on and lie and say that coal is incredibly toxic
[1:36:45.000 --> 1:36:49.000]  I'm going to play a three-minute news piece coming up the next segment
[1:36:49.000 --> 1:36:54.000]  Where they go from the beginning to the end of the steps with coal
[1:36:54.000 --> 1:37:00.000]  And document that all that comes out of the smokestack is water vapor and carbon dioxide
[1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000]  Nothing else comes out
[1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:05.000]  That's why they're saying they want to tax carbon now
[1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:12.000]  With regulations that were reasonable in the last 50 years, they've made our coal almost completely, perfectly clean
[1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:18.000]  And even if we're going to move to something new, you're not going to do this overnight
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:26.000]  And so the White House and not just Obama but Biden and others are on record saying that they want to bankrupt coal
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:32.000]  Now continuing with the White House trying to counter our report
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:40.000]  Some are trying to blame these blackouts, which the industry has already provided explanation for
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:44.000]  Well of course the industry said it was the coal weather that caused them not to be able to meet demand
[1:37:44.000 --> 1:37:50.000]  That's the point is that we haven't built enough plants and our prices have gone way up because they haven't built more plants
[1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:55.000]  And only selective insiders like GE get to build new plants so they get all the profits
[1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.000]  See, it's all deception
[1:37:57.000 --> 1:38:01.000]  Some are trying to blame these blackouts, which the industry has already provided explanation for
[1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:05.000]  On the clean air act standards under consideration to curb dangerous pollution
[1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:10.000]  That's the new ratcheting up of the Kyoto Protocol that Congress hasn't passed
[1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:14.000]  So here's another deception, they go on to say, well we haven't implemented this yet
[1:38:14.000 --> 1:38:17.000]  Yeah, because Texas is suing you, you tried to implement it last year
[1:38:17.000 --> 1:38:22.000]  It's set to go into implementation next month and the feds have taken over the Texas power plants
[1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:25.000]  That supply the surrounding five states with much of their power
[1:38:25.000 --> 1:38:32.000]  So again, it's another deception here claiming that they haven't put any of these new restrictions in yet
[1:38:32.000 --> 1:38:38.000]  Obama took the old ready regulations that were in place and used those
[1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:42.000]  And we have an article countering this and the article that we originally wrote shows all the examples
[1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:45.000]  Headline Obama EPA shuts down South Dakota plant
[1:38:45.000 --> 1:38:47.000]  Obama EPA shuts down Georgia plant
[1:38:47.000 --> 1:38:50.000]  Obama EPA shuts down Texas plant
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:53.000]  Obama EPA denies permit to new plant
[1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:57.000]  Obama EPA moves to block New Corpus Christi power plant
[1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.000]  On and on and on
[1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:04.000]  Our article is big and beefy and thick and long and filled with links
[1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:08.000]  There's nothing in Obama's article
[1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:11.000]  They're just shoveling your lies
[1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:15.000]  Some are trying to blame these blackouts which the industry has already provided explanation for
[1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:21.000]  On the clean air act standards under consideration to curb dangerous pollution including carbon pollution
[1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:25.000]  Oh, to curb dangerous pollution including carbon pollution
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:30.000]  Which is carbon dioxide that humans exhale that plants breathe, that plants live off of
[1:39:30.000 --> 1:39:35.000]  While these claims gain traction on the internet, there is a major problem with this theory
[1:39:35.000 --> 1:39:40.000]  No power plant in Texas has yet been required to do anything to control carbon pollution
[1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:42.000]  They're calling carbon dioxide
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:46.000]  See because nothing's coming out of them now but water vapor and carbon dioxide
[1:39:46.000 --> 1:39:49.000]  And they know that the general public knows that water isn't bad
[1:39:49.000 --> 1:39:53.000]  So they pick the other thing coming out of them and call it carbon pollution
[1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:55.000]  Yeah, carbon dioxide
[1:39:55.000 --> 1:40:00.000]  In December the EPA announced that it intended to update important clean air act standards for decades
[1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:03.000]  Have decreased harmful pollution and protected public health
[1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:08.000]  In the coming months the EPA will work closely with key stakeholders including industry
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:16.000]  That means GE who's exempt to develop a common sense standards for currently unchecked dangerous carbon pollution
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:21.000]  And then when you read closer what they're talking about that's carbon dioxide
[1:40:21.000 --> 1:40:24.000]  But the average person reading this goes oh well they're trying to save you from pollution
[1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:30.000]  Any standard which will leverage existing technologies and only apply to the largest polluters
[1:40:30.000 --> 1:40:35.000]  Will not be proposed until later this year allowing an extensive public comment period
[1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:40.000]  And following that additional input no final rule is scheduled to be in place until late 2012
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:43.000]  They're already implementing all this stuff for two years
[1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:49.000]  We've got countless links to mainstream news where they've been shutting them down, more lies
[1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:55.000]  Despite these modest steps you just heard Obama say he wants the most draconian of any country
[1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:57.000]  A 50% cut
[1:40:57.000 --> 1:41:01.000]  You just heard the president say he wants to bankrupt them
[1:41:01.000 --> 1:41:04.000]  You just heard him say he wants the most draconian
[1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:08.000]  I've got clips of Biden by the way in our article saying you're not going to be allowed to have a plan
[1:41:08.000 --> 1:41:12.000]  But here they are lying saying we just want some modest reasonable
[1:41:12.000 --> 1:41:15.000]  Come on
[1:41:15.000 --> 1:41:19.000]  Despite these modest steps many continue to mischaracterize this process
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:25.000]  Making unsubstantiated claims about the impact this will have on everything from industry to energy prices
[1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000]  Energy prices are way up no one denies that
[1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  The most recent effort simply underscores a willingness to ignore the facts
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:37.000]  They presented none here to further an agenda that seeks to stop the EPA from sensible updates
[1:41:37.000 --> 1:41:39.000]  Updates to the Clean Air Act
[1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:44.000]  No it's the Kyoto Protocol Treaty that you couldn't get rammed through
[1:41:44.000 --> 1:41:46.000]  That you couldn't get passed
[1:41:46.000 --> 1:41:48.000]  That the Congress wouldn't pass
[1:41:48.000 --> 1:41:51.000]  And so now they're having congressional hearings about it
[1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:57.000]  The state of Texas and others are suing you just like the Health Care Act is being ruled unconstitutional
[1:41:57.000 --> 1:42:01.000]  And Obama's giving hundreds of waivers to his friends like McDonald's
[1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:05.000]  And then Water Burger or Burger King don't get waivers
[1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:09.000]  And their prices have to go up and they got to buy insurance but McDonald's doesn't
[1:42:09.000 --> 1:42:11.000]  And it's the same thing here
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:16.000]  In fact if we can pull up that headline, it was in the AP, it was also in the Washington Examiner
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:22.000]  Obama gives GE exemption on new clean air rules
[1:42:22.000 --> 1:42:24.000]  But no one else gets these exemptions
[1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:26.000]  This is what we're talking about
[1:42:26.000 --> 1:42:28.000]  This is unfair, this is wrong
[1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:31.000]  And it's for insiders to make giant profits
[1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:35.000]  The former head of GE that lobbied for all of this just two years ago
[1:42:35.000 --> 1:42:38.000]  Is now the head of the President's Economic Council
[1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:41.000]  Talk about conflict of interest
[1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:43.000]  And by the way it's not just us saying this
[1:42:43.000 --> 1:42:46.000]  After we reported on it and they linked our story
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:50.000]  The Heritage Foundation concurred
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:54.000]  There's the headline Obama issues global warming rules in January
[1:42:54.000 --> 1:42:57.000]  Exempts GE power plants in February
[1:42:57.000 --> 1:43:09.000]  Stay with us, we're going to break it all down
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:34.000]  I'm looking for America
[1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:36.000]  We're American and be proud

[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:48.000]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan

[1:46:58.000 --> 1:47:27.000]  Thank you
[1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:35.000]  We're live at Sunday the 6th of day of February 2011
[1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:37.000]  Super Bowl Sunday
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:39.000]  I'm going to be talking about the police state at the Super Bowl
[1:47:39.000 --> 1:47:42.000]  The latest developments in Egypt
[1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:46.000]  And a lot more coming up in the next hour
[1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:49.000]  But the bottom line here is
[1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000]  Look at how weak the White House is
[1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:53.000]  Look at how scared they are
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:55.000]  Of prisonplanet.com
[1:47:55.000 --> 1:47:57.000]  Yes, prisonplanet.com according to Alexa Ratings
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000]  And Google Analytics
[1:47:59.000 --> 1:48:02.000]  Does get more visitors than MSNBC.com
[1:48:02.000 --> 1:48:04.000]  They're afraid of the alternative media
[1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:06.000]  They're afraid of talk radio
[1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000]  Which is why they're openly moving to censor and attack
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:12.000]  Free speech and put the fairness doctrine back into place
[1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:15.000]  Read our article that got the White House so upset
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:21.000]  And then compare it to the White House's response
[1:48:21.000 --> 1:48:23.000]  Which we just chronicled the lies in
[1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:25.000]  White Houseattacksprisonplanet.com
[1:48:25.000 --> 1:48:27.000]  Report on blackouts
[1:48:27.000 --> 1:48:30.000]  Our original article picked up by Fox News
[1:48:30.000 --> 1:48:33.000]  They just took our story and directly linked to it
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:35.000]  Obama's blocking of new power plants
[1:48:35.000 --> 1:48:38.000]  Triggers nationwide blackouts
[1:48:38.000 --> 1:48:40.000]  But they put a question mark on the end of it
[1:48:40.000 --> 1:48:43.000]  And again, our article was about nationwide
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:47.000]  You saw it last week from California to New York
[1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000]  Power outages all over the place
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000]  Because they've cut back so much
[1:48:51.000 --> 1:48:53.000]  Now for the insiders that are still allowed to operate
[1:48:53.000 --> 1:48:55.000]  They make bigger profits and that's great
[1:48:55.000 --> 1:48:57.000]  But we become like Venezuela
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:48:59.000]  You know why Chesky fell in 89?
[1:48:59.000 --> 1:49:02.000]  Because he controlled the only power plants in the country
[1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:05.000]  And used it to become a billionaire and build big palaces
[1:49:05.000 --> 1:49:09.000]  And the Romanians, it's on, even CIA fact book
[1:49:09.000 --> 1:49:12.000]  They admit, rebelled mainly over the rolling blackouts
[1:49:12.000 --> 1:49:14.000]  That they were so sick of
[1:49:14.000 --> 1:49:16.000]  So another sign of authoritarianism
[1:49:16.000 --> 1:49:19.000]  Now, the biggest lie in their report
[1:49:19.000 --> 1:49:21.000]  Isn't that they didn't link to us
[1:49:21.000 --> 1:49:23.000]  So people can see what we actually said
[1:49:23.000 --> 1:49:25.000]  Or that we said it was just a Texas issue
[1:49:25.000 --> 1:49:28.000]  Or to imply that we didn't say it was originally triggered
[1:49:28.000 --> 1:49:30.000]  By the cold weather
[1:49:30.000 --> 1:49:33.000]  But that, again, we couldn't respond because of lack of power plants
[1:49:33.000 --> 1:49:36.000]  It's where they keep saying horrible carbon pollution
[1:49:36.000 --> 1:49:40.000]  Now, I have family who have been engineers
[1:49:40.000 --> 1:49:42.000]  One of them's retired now
[1:49:42.000 --> 1:49:45.000]  And worked in both oil refineries and coal power plants
[1:49:45.000 --> 1:49:48.000]  And I've seen them over the years get so angry
[1:49:48.000 --> 1:49:51.000]  When they hear reports about dirty coal
[1:49:51.000 --> 1:49:55.000]  There are federally mandated sensors in the stacks
[1:49:55.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  If anything but carbon dioxide and water comes out
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:03.000]  Alarms go off, they have to shut all the smoke
[1:50:03.000 --> 1:50:06.000]  Into a holding area and basically turn the power plant off
[1:50:06.000 --> 1:50:08.000]  They're not allowed to release any
[1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:10.000]  The federal government has sessons that fly above
[1:50:10.000 --> 1:50:14.000]  Every major plant every day with their own sensors
[1:50:14.000 --> 1:50:17.000]  And so I thought I would play for you
[1:50:17.000 --> 1:50:20.000]  Just to illustrate this line
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:23.000]  A piece that was done with the officials
[1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:26.000]  Of the Chesterfield plant outside Richmond, Virginia
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:29.000]  Now, this is the modern type of plant
[1:50:29.000 --> 1:50:31.000]  That by federal mandate, and that's reasonable
[1:50:31.000 --> 1:50:34.000]  Has been in place for at least the last 30 years
[1:50:34.000 --> 1:50:37.000]  There are no coal power plants out there
[1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:42.000]  That are not scrubbing the exhaust, okay?
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:45.000]  So I'm going to play this clip right now
[1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:47.000]  It goes through a giant catalytic converter
[1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000]  Then it goes through all these other scrubbers
[1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:55.000]  And nothing comes out but carbon dioxide and water vapor
[1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000]  So the feds are saying, we're going to say
[1:50:57.000 --> 1:51:00.000]  That carbon dioxide's bad and restrict it
[1:51:00.000 --> 1:51:02.000]  So the power companies say, okay
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:05.000]  We'll start shunting it into old wellheads
[1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:07.000]  We'll put it underground, they say, no, you're not allowed to do that
[1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:09.000]  And so your prices are going up
[1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:11.000]  And now it's going to get worse
[1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:15.000]  Obama's other big lie is claiming that
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:17.000]  They haven't put anything new in place
[1:51:17.000 --> 1:51:19.000]  In the last two years and that nothing's changed
[1:51:19.000 --> 1:51:20.000]  That's another line
[1:51:20.000 --> 1:51:22.000]  We have countless links in our article
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:24.000]  Responding in our original article
[1:51:24.000 --> 1:51:26.000]  To mainstream news headline
[1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:28.000]  Obama's EPA shuts down this power plant
[1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:29.000]  That power plant
[1:51:29.000 --> 1:51:32.000]  13 power plants shut down in Pennsylvania
[1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:34.000]  Seven shut down in Texas
[1:51:34.000 --> 1:51:36.000]  I mean, it goes on and on
[1:51:36.000 --> 1:51:40.000]  But they're counting on you being ignorant
[1:51:40.000 --> 1:51:43.000]  But it shows the power of the alternative media
[1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:45.000]  And it shows that the crooks in Washington
[1:51:45.000 --> 1:51:46.000]  Are just men like us
[1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:47.000]  They're not invincible
[1:51:47.000 --> 1:51:49.000]  And responding to them with the truth
[1:51:49.000 --> 1:51:51.000]  Is having an effect to the point of where
[1:51:51.000 --> 1:51:53.000]  The White House.gov on its front page
[1:51:53.000 --> 1:51:56.000]  In the last two days has been responding to the story
[1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:58.000]  We put out that was then picked up
[1:51:58.000 --> 1:52:00.000]  By newspapers nationwide
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:03.000]  And major think tanks like Heritage Foundation
[1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:06.000]  And others concurred with our analysis
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:08.000]  We gave facts, they gave lies
[1:52:08.000 --> 1:52:10.000]  Now here's a short clip
[1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:12.000]  Breaking down the process
[1:52:12.000 --> 1:52:14.000]  The video's posted in our article
[1:52:14.000 --> 1:52:16.000]  Responding to it if you're a radio listener
[1:52:16.000 --> 1:52:18.000]  Want to see the video, not just here
[1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:20.000]  The audio, it's posted the article
[1:52:20.000 --> 1:52:22.000]  Whitehouseattacksprisonplanet.com
[1:52:22.000 --> 1:52:24.000]  Reports on blackouts at
[1:52:24.000 --> 1:52:26.000]  Prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[1:52:26.000 --> 1:52:27.000]  Here's that clip
[1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:31.000]  This plant burns about a train load of coal per day
[1:52:31.000 --> 1:52:33.000]  Which is about 100 train cars
[1:52:33.000 --> 1:52:36.000]  Each train car holds about 100 tons
[1:52:36.000 --> 1:52:38.000]  About 10,000 tons of coal per day
[1:52:38.000 --> 1:52:39.000]  This is the whole process
[1:52:39.000 --> 1:52:41.000]  Let's start the finish
[1:52:41.000 --> 1:52:43.000]  The Cheshire Power Station consists of
[1:52:43.000 --> 1:52:46.000]  Four coal units and two gas-fired units
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:48.000]  The coal units operate very simply
[1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:51.000]  We take coal, comes in in coal cars each day
[1:52:51.000 --> 1:52:54.000]  And we crush it up, run on conveyor belts into the plant
[1:52:54.000 --> 1:52:56.000]  And then it goes to another stage
[1:52:56.000 --> 1:52:58.000]  Where it's crushed into very fine powder
[1:52:58.000 --> 1:52:59.000]  Like talcum powder
[1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:00.000]  This is energy independence
[1:53:00.000 --> 1:53:02.000]  That point is blown by large fans into the furnace
[1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  Where it combusts and makes heat
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:07.000]  That heat energy is transferred through tubes
[1:53:07.000 --> 1:53:08.000]  Into water on the other side
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:10.000]  And boils that water into steam
[1:53:10.000 --> 1:53:13.000]  That steam then runs large steam turbines
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  That run a shaft that turns a generator
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:16.000]  That then makes electricity
[1:53:16.000 --> 1:53:18.000]  And it's delivered to our customers
[1:53:18.000 --> 1:53:21.000]  That's an actual coal dust load in the plant
[1:53:21.000 --> 1:53:22.000]  Great
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  We go with a little fuel
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:25.000]  It's got a little dark shade
[1:53:25.000 --> 1:53:26.000]  Anybody's allowed to set these down
[1:53:26.000 --> 1:53:28.000]  Cheshire Power Station, as we have at most
[1:53:28.000 --> 1:53:29.000]  Of our power stations
[1:53:29.000 --> 1:53:30.000]  They will have devices within the furnace
[1:53:30.000 --> 1:53:33.000]  That help reduce our nitrous oxide production
[1:53:33.000 --> 1:53:35.000]  Nitrous oxide is a component that ultimately
[1:53:35.000 --> 1:53:37.000]  Can become small again in the atmosphere
[1:53:37.000 --> 1:53:39.000]  So we like to reduce that right at the furnace
[1:53:39.000 --> 1:53:41.000]  We use low nitrous oxide burners
[1:53:41.000 --> 1:53:43.000]  And over fire air to reduce it in the
[1:53:43.000 --> 1:53:44.000]  In the boiler itself
[1:53:44.000 --> 1:53:46.000]  Once the gas comes out of the boiler
[1:53:46.000 --> 1:53:48.000]  On three to four units here
[1:53:48.000 --> 1:53:51.000]  We have devices called selective catalytic reduction devices
[1:53:51.000 --> 1:53:54.000]  And that's like the catalytic converter on your car
[1:53:54.000 --> 1:53:56.000]  It takes the nitrous oxide that's produced
[1:53:56.000 --> 1:53:59.000]  In the furnace when you combust air and coal
[1:53:59.000 --> 1:54:01.000]  And separates out the nitrous oxide
[1:54:01.000 --> 1:54:03.000]  Back into nitrogen and oxygen
[1:54:03.000 --> 1:54:06.000]  Which is available in the air as we breathe it today
[1:54:06.000 --> 1:54:07.000]  So it basically puts it back the way it was
[1:54:07.000 --> 1:54:09.000]  Before it went to the combustion process
[1:54:09.000 --> 1:54:11.000]  Once the flue gas comes out of that
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:14.000]  It goes through a device to remove particulate matter
[1:54:14.000 --> 1:54:16.000]  Either an electrostatic precipitator
[1:54:16.000 --> 1:54:18.000]  Which is like an electrostatic air cleaner in your home
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:19.000]  That's a dry scrubber
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:20.000]  Or goes through a baghouse
[1:54:20.000 --> 1:54:22.000]  A baghouse is very similar to the bag
[1:54:22.000 --> 1:54:24.000]  You might have on your vacuum cleaner at home
[1:54:24.000 --> 1:54:25.000]  The air goes through and any particulate matter
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:26.000]  Get stuck in the bag
[1:54:26.000 --> 1:54:28.000]  And we periodically empty those bags out
[1:54:28.000 --> 1:54:30.000]  And clean them and replace them
[1:54:30.000 --> 1:54:32.000]  The last step is the scrubber
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:35.000]  Or a flue-gasty sulfurization device
[1:54:35.000 --> 1:54:37.000]  That removes the sulfur dioxide
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:39.000]  And the mercury from the flue gas
[1:54:39.000 --> 1:54:41.000]  And the way they work is quite simple
[1:54:41.000 --> 1:54:44.000]  We take limestone and grind it up into a fine powder
[1:54:44.000 --> 1:54:47.000]  Mix it with water to create a slurry
[1:54:47.000 --> 1:54:49.000]  And then spray that into the flue stream
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:52.000]  The flue gas goes through this limestone mixture
[1:54:52.000 --> 1:54:56.000]  And chemically creates a chemical which becomes gypsum
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:54:58.000]  It's the same stuff that's used in wallboards
[1:54:58.000 --> 1:55:00.000]  In fact, this facility will supply gypsum
[1:55:00.000 --> 1:55:02.000]  To a local wallboard manufacturer
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:04.000]  To recycle the material into wallboard
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:06.000]  For people to use in their homes
[1:55:06.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  And once you do that, the mercury and the sulfur dioxide
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:10.000]  Comes out of the flue gas
[1:55:10.000 --> 1:55:12.000]  Once you see go up the stack
[1:55:12.000 --> 1:55:13.000]  Has moisture in it
[1:55:13.000 --> 1:55:15.000]  And no more sulfur dioxide or mercury
[1:55:17.000 --> 1:55:18.000]  All right
[1:55:19.000 --> 1:55:20.000]  None
[1:55:20.000 --> 1:55:21.000]  None
[1:55:21.000 --> 1:55:22.000]  There are sensors on it
[1:55:22.000 --> 1:55:23.000]  They're not allowed to release any
[1:55:23.000 --> 1:55:26.000]  It's water vapor and carbon dioxide
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:27.000]  That plants breathe
[1:55:27.000 --> 1:55:29.000]  And I've seen major university studies
[1:55:29.000 --> 1:55:31.000]  Where just the surrounding plants
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:34.000]  And trees and grass around a coal powered plant
[1:55:34.000 --> 1:55:37.000]  Grow faster or healthier
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:39.000]  You can just pull up studies
[1:55:39.000 --> 1:55:42.000]  Show carbon, increase carbon dioxide
[1:55:42.000 --> 1:55:45.000]  Makes plants healthier and grow faster
[1:55:45.000 --> 1:55:46.000]  Increase crop yields
[1:55:47.000 --> 1:55:49.000]  In fact, the earth has had
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:51.000]  Well, just in the last 100,000 years
[1:55:51.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  14 times higher carbon dioxide
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:54.000]  In the atmosphere than it has now
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:56.000]  We're in a carbon-starved position
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:55:58.000]  The life cycle on our planet
[1:55:58.000 --> 1:56:01.000]  Is carbon dioxide, oxygen, water, and sunlight
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:05.000]  You've got to have those four basic ingredients
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:07.000]  And so the White House keeps talking about
[1:56:07.000 --> 1:56:09.000]  Carbon pollution, carbon pollution
[1:56:09.000 --> 1:56:11.000]  But to sum it all up
[1:56:11.000 --> 1:56:13.000]  If you have a true free market
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:15.000]  And cities, counties, private interest
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:17.000]  Build power plants
[1:56:17.000 --> 1:56:19.000]  That's competitive supply and demand
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:21.000]  It drives down prices
[1:56:21.000 --> 1:56:23.000]  Massively
[1:56:23.000 --> 1:56:26.000]  Massively drives down prices
[1:56:26.000 --> 1:56:28.000]  But if you're insiders
[1:56:28.000 --> 1:56:30.000]  And you can get globalists in place
[1:56:30.000 --> 1:56:32.000]  All over the world, not just here
[1:56:32.000 --> 1:56:34.000]  They can use governments to shut down
[1:56:34.000 --> 1:56:35.000]  All the smaller plants
[1:56:35.000 --> 1:56:37.000]  Or plants that aren't insiders
[1:56:37.000 --> 1:56:38.000]  They won't get the waivers
[1:56:38.000 --> 1:56:40.000]  They can't release carbon dioxide
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:41.000]  But the general electric
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:43.000]  And a handful of others, they do
[1:56:43.000 --> 1:56:45.000]  Meanwhile, a bunch of plants have been built
[1:56:45.000 --> 1:56:47.000]  By globalists on the U.S.-Mexico border
[1:56:47.000 --> 1:56:48.000]  On the Mexican side
[1:56:48.000 --> 1:56:50.000]  Where there is no controls
[1:56:50.000 --> 1:56:53.000]  They actually put the mercury right into the air
[1:56:53.000 --> 1:56:55.000]  Then that blows across
[1:56:55.000 --> 1:56:56.000]  But they can do it cheaper
[1:56:56.000 --> 1:56:58.000]  And then supply the U.S.
[1:56:58.000 --> 1:56:59.000]  And make even bigger profits
[1:56:59.000 --> 1:57:01.000]  So they use regulations
[1:57:01.000 --> 1:57:03.000]  To shut down their competition
[1:57:03.000 --> 1:57:04.000]  Now coming back in the next hour
[1:57:04.000 --> 1:57:05.000]  Shifting gears
[1:57:05.000 --> 1:57:07.000]  The TSA is there running it
[1:57:07.000 --> 1:57:08.000]  In Dallas
[1:57:08.000 --> 1:57:10.000]  Up there at Cowboy Stadiums
[1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:11.000]  They are sticking their hands down
[1:57:11.000 --> 1:57:12.000]  People's pants
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:13.000]  They are doing the pat-downs
[1:57:13.000 --> 1:57:15.000]  This is part of the slave training
[1:57:15.000 --> 1:57:16.000]  Of America
[1:57:16.000 --> 1:57:18.000]  We're going to go over the police state
[1:57:18.000 --> 1:57:20.000]  As well, get into what's happening
[1:57:20.000 --> 1:57:21.000]  In Egypt
[1:57:21.000 --> 1:57:22.000]  And a lot more
[1:57:22.000 --> 1:57:23.000]  On the other side
[1:57:23.000 --> 1:57:25.000]  But did you ever think you'd see it?
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:28.000]  Where WhiteHouse.gov
[1:57:28.000 --> 1:57:29.000]  Responding to us
[1:57:29.000 --> 1:57:31.000]  With a tissue of lies and propaganda
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:33.000]  And it shows they're on the defensive
[1:57:33.000 --> 1:57:36.000]  And the Info War is having huge effects
[1:57:36.000 --> 1:57:37.000]  So I salute everybody
[1:57:37.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  That helped get that story out
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:40.000]  Let's get our counter story out
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:41.000]  As well, right now
[1:57:41.000 --> 1:57:43.000]  It's at InfoWars.com
[1:57:43.000 --> 1:57:45.000]  Second hour coming up
