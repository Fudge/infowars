[00:00:12.671 --> 00:00:17.074]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[00:00:17.074 --> 00:00:23.879]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.879 --> 00:00:28.802]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is May 2nd, 2019 on this Thursday, Global Transmission.
[00:00:28.802 --> 00:00:30.763]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:33.405]  I'll be here the next four hours.
[00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:34.986]  Leanne McAdoo is going to return.
[00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:37.888]  She'll be in studio with us in the third and part of the fourth hour.
[00:00:37.888 --> 00:00:40.470]  I intend to open the phones up as well today.
[00:00:42.008 --> 00:01:05.126]  Hillary Clinton went on Mad Cow's show last night, and with the plunging ratings down to almost no viewers, and when we're going to play the clips, said that she's living rent-free in the president's head and that the Russians are going to try to steal 2020 again, relaunching that whole hoax, when if anybody's in bed with the Russians, it's you, lady, and you know that.
[00:01:06.407 --> 00:01:24.325]  But since she had a Freudian moment of truth, Freudian slip of the tongue as they say, and said we need the communist Chinese to come in and overthrow Trump, you understand of the big six production companies, the Chai Com's own controlling interest, and our funding, total weaponization.
[00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:30.377]  Teaching people how to self-harm, teaching little girls how to commit suicide, breaking up the family.
[00:01:30.377 --> 00:01:32.038]  All this stuff's illegal in China.
[00:01:32.038 --> 00:01:35.200]  They don't let their own production company material air there.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.842]  They say it demoralizes and is designed to bring down the country.
[00:01:37.842 --> 00:01:43.025]  But they hit us with the most scientifically designed demoralization.
[00:01:43.886 --> 00:01:47.988]  And even though Hillary lost, they're still following through with their operation.
[00:01:47.988 --> 00:01:51.569]  It's come out that all the big universities are basically CHICOM-controlled now.
[00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:52.750]  The public universities.
[00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.850]  That's mainstream news now.
[00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.111]  Washington Post.
[00:01:55.111 --> 00:01:56.531]  It's coming out everywhere.
[00:01:56.531 --> 00:02:00.113]  And when it all comes out, it's over for all you collaborators.
[00:02:00.113 --> 00:02:02.914]  So she's trying to mainline it now and make a joke.
[00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:06.335]  Oh, he said, I don't care who's got the WikiLeaks.
[00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:08.636]  If you got Hillary's emails, it was the Russians, release them.
[00:02:08.636 --> 00:02:09.417]  That's tongue-in-cheek.
[00:02:10.177 --> 00:02:12.560]  She has a history of being in bed with the Chai Koms.
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.565]  The Chai Koms have a thousand times the influence the Russians do in this country.
[00:02:16.565 --> 00:02:17.946]  It's a fact.
[00:02:17.946 --> 00:02:20.229]  And China is the big military threat.
[00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:21.570]  And China is out of control.
[00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.973]  And China's been given all our deepwater ports.
[00:02:23.973 --> 00:02:26.456]  And China is heavily involved in her foundation.
[00:02:26.456 --> 00:02:29.660]  But see, how do you, if you're a foreign globalist, you're an enemy of the country.
[00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:34.099]  How do you defeat the population you're enslaving?
[00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.320]  You demoralize them.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:43.906]  But then, in the final phase, you tell them, oh, this other big power, it's only coming in because, you know, there's this other power that Trump's allied with.
[00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:47.549]  That's how you sell people on the screwjob.
[00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.693]  And her and Joe Biden and their criminal families have gotten millions of smackeroonies from the Chai comms.
[00:02:53.693 --> 00:02:54.774]  Remember the famous footage on
[00:02:55.374 --> 00:03:02.035]  On C-SPAN, it was like 20 years ago, the Chinese generals with big briefcases of cash to get the missile secrets.
[00:03:02.035 --> 00:03:05.976]  It's like, here's 30 million dollars, and he's like, here's missile secret.
[00:03:05.976 --> 00:03:09.177]  I mean, it's like putting money in a vending machine.
[00:03:09.177 --> 00:03:11.377]  Put a dollar bill in and get a candy bar out.
[00:03:11.377 --> 00:03:16.678]  Put a 30, 40 million in and get the MIRV technology for the ICBMs.
[00:03:16.678 --> 00:03:20.859]  Twenty-something years ago, the CHICOMs couldn't get an ICBM off the ground.
[00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:21.739]  They all blew up.
[00:03:22.873 --> 00:03:27.395]  Imagine, Rachel, that you had one of the Democratic nominees for 2020.
[00:03:52.171 --> 00:03:52.712]  I think?
[00:04:11.463 --> 00:04:13.926]  Why don't we ask China to back us?
[00:04:13.926 --> 00:04:15.067]  I hear by tonight.
[00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:15.787]  Ask China.
[00:04:15.787 --> 00:04:16.448]  That's right.
[00:04:16.448 --> 00:04:22.174]  And not only that, China, if you're listening, why don't you get Trump's tax returns?
[00:04:22.174 --> 00:04:26.278]  I'm sure our media would richly reward you.
[00:04:26.278 --> 00:04:33.425]  Now, according to the Mueller report, that is not conspiracy because it's done right out in the open.
[00:04:34.185 --> 00:04:50.369]  So, if after this hypothetical Democratic candidate says this on your show, within hours, all of a sudden the IRS offices are bombarded with incredibly sophisticated... I want to come back with this demon's last political gasp.
[00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.789]  Stay with us.
[00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:56.270]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.191]  Spreading those links is an act of rebellion to tyranny.
[00:05:00.282 --> 00:05:05.708]  You know, the worst part about getting old and I'm still strong at 45 is that I won't be there for my children someday.
[00:05:05.708 --> 00:05:07.510]  That's why I need to make them strong now.
[00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.271]  Now, I can be there for my children.
[00:05:09.271 --> 00:05:11.093]  Now, I can make them strong.
[00:05:11.093 --> 00:05:12.755]  Now, I can instruct them.
[00:05:12.755 --> 00:05:14.477]  Now, I can teach them what I've learned.
[00:05:14.477 --> 00:05:15.458]  But not once I'm gone.
[00:05:15.558 --> 00:05:20.701]  You think in this digital age, your word's gone forever, but now they're even better at getting rid of what you said they were before.
[00:05:20.701 --> 00:05:26.284]  It's so much easier to burn video or text or languages now that we have high-tech book burning, isn't it?
[00:05:26.284 --> 00:05:29.926]  But I have joined my will to the resistance.
[00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:34.908]  I can't be destroyed now, as long as I realize I've done right and as long as the people know the truth.
[00:05:34.908 --> 00:05:41.712]  And you can't be destroyed either, as long as you bind yourself to something and commit to it and go through the fire for it.
[00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:45.574]  There is a magic that then takes place that transcends space and time.
[00:05:45.574 --> 00:05:53.199]  When you commit via word of mouth, or to pray for us, or to spread our articles and videos, that overrides everything the enemy's doing.
[00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:59.804]  So please now, commit to support InfoWars however you can, and realize your provision to InfoWars is your own provision.
[00:06:11.829 --> 00:06:13.290]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.412]  Venezuela is already collapsed.
[00:06:37.412 --> 00:06:39.534]  The question is, how bad is it going to get?
[00:06:39.534 --> 00:06:41.055]  Who's going to take control of it?
[00:06:41.055 --> 00:06:45.278]  Trump's now signaling that they're reportedly going to quote, do something next week.
[00:06:45.278 --> 00:06:49.841]  Is that just propaganda purposes so that Maduro goes ahead and flees?
[00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:50.402]  Who knows?
[00:06:50.402 --> 00:06:53.284]  We're going to be watching all that very, very closely.
[00:06:53.284 --> 00:06:53.504]  U.S.
[00:06:53.504 --> 00:07:00.089]  military is prepping for the takeover in Venezuela of who they recognize as the president.
[00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:04.352]  We have just got so much amazing news on that front.
[00:07:04.352 --> 00:07:05.213]  Phoenix's St.
[00:07:05.213 --> 00:07:08.736]  Joseph Catholic Church has been destroyed by fire.
[00:07:08.736 --> 00:07:09.817]  Who knows if that's arson?
[00:07:09.817 --> 00:07:11.959]  We know a lot of these are arson.
[00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:15.422]  We're also going to obviously look at the big deep state war going on.
[00:07:15.422 --> 00:07:16.863]  That's front and center.
[00:07:16.863 --> 00:07:20.946]  With Barr now having Pelosi say he's a criminal.
[00:07:20.946 --> 00:07:26.751]  That he lied to Congress with no evidence when they've had this parade of liars up there lying to Congress.
[00:07:26.751 --> 00:07:28.132]  So that war is kicking into
[00:07:29.293 --> 00:07:34.254]  Very high gear after the contentious activity that happened in the Senate yesterday.
[00:07:34.254 --> 00:07:41.636]  He did not show up because he couldn't agree to the ground rules with the chairman of the committee, Nadler, a.k.a.
[00:07:41.636 --> 00:07:42.836]  the Penguin.
[00:07:42.836 --> 00:07:55.959]  So we're going to get to some of the highlights from yesterday, some of the bizarre highlights today with congressmen with buckets of chicken and toy chickens they're throwing around and acting bizarre as their mental illness just intensifies.
[00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:57.279]  And of course, one of the big issues
[00:07:58.725 --> 00:08:23.259]  Is Hillary Clinton, ladies and gentlemen, going on Rachel Maddow Show with its, again, dismal plunging ratings after their whole Russia hoax fell flat, and saying that we need the Chinese, we need the Chinese Communist to come to the aid in 2020 and overthrow the election and remove Trump.
[00:08:23.259 --> 00:08:24.640]  Now, here's what's incredible.
[00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:44.717]  This is the only place, unless you're actually reading intelligence reports put out by patriots at the Pentagon and some of the patriots in intelligence agencies, that China is more politically engaged in this country than the Democrats, than the Republicans, than the
[00:08:46.164 --> 00:08:47.965]  In R.A.
[00:08:47.965 --> 00:08:50.166]  China has over 10,000 front companies.
[00:08:50.166 --> 00:08:55.428]  China owns a majority stock in all of the major production houses, all six.
[00:08:55.428 --> 00:08:57.389]  Tried to buy up the two smaller ones last year.
[00:08:57.389 --> 00:09:00.090]  Trump put the kibosh on that.
[00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:01.451]  They own the majority of our debt.
[00:09:01.451 --> 00:09:02.871]  They steal all our technology.
[00:09:02.871 --> 00:09:03.952]  They've got all the major U.S.
[00:09:03.952 --> 00:09:12.615]  companies, big tech officially moving there, Apple, Google, you name it, to then be tax exempt and state run.
[00:09:12.615 --> 00:09:13.236]  And I was in D.C.
[00:09:14.997 --> 00:09:16.777]  Talking to Eric Bolling and people, he couldn't believe it.
[00:09:16.777 --> 00:09:19.478]  And then when his staff pulled it up, he was blown away.
[00:09:19.478 --> 00:09:23.539]  But when I was meeting with people in U.S.
[00:09:23.539 --> 00:09:26.420]  intelligence, they all are on the exact same page.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.640]  Everybody knows what's going on.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.720]  This is hiding in plain view, okay?
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.261]  This is all right out in the open.
[00:09:32.261 --> 00:09:34.361]  America was basically done.
[00:09:34.361 --> 00:09:35.321]  We've been totally sold out.
[00:09:35.321 --> 00:09:42.023]  We're being prepared to be collapsed, economically, and be a vassal state managed by the Democrats, the EU, and the Chai Cops.
[00:09:44.346 --> 00:09:55.728]  And Trump came in, turned the whole thing around, made Saudi Arabia stand down, wiped out ISIS with the Russians, was trying to stabilize the economy, the Federal Reserve came in, the private Federal Reserve, they tried to kill the economy.
[00:09:55.728 --> 00:09:57.828]  They almost did, but Trump got it reversed.
[00:09:57.828 --> 00:10:02.429]  We are in an absolute death match with the globalists, okay?
[00:10:02.429 --> 00:10:05.550]  This isn't like you get in a boxing ring and they put gloves on you.
[00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:11.651]  This is you get in a boxing ring and they hand you, like out of Escape from New York, baseball bats with nails in them and trash can lids.
[00:10:13.137 --> 00:10:18.441]  You have to understand, the globalists made their move with Hillary.
[00:10:18.441 --> 00:10:22.604]  They're making their move all over the world and people, humanity, is desperately fighting back.
[00:10:22.604 --> 00:10:32.732]  And Trump is just the deucex, perfect manifestation of how God works in mysterious ways that you have somebody with that charisma, that stamina, that will.
[00:10:32.732 --> 00:10:36.675]  He's not perfect, none of us are, but God's plan is perfect.
[00:10:36.675 --> 00:10:41.158]  And they are so pissed because no weapon formed against us is prospering right now.
[00:10:41.158 --> 00:10:41.679]  That said,
[00:10:42.699 --> 00:10:45.741]  The Pentagon and the military are on alert.
[00:10:45.741 --> 00:10:51.605]  As you know, a bunch of generals and admirals and others have been removed or have had their chain of command cut.
[00:10:51.605 --> 00:10:54.087]  They've been basically back benched.
[00:10:54.087 --> 00:10:55.648]  And it's not just the head of Guantanamo Bay.
[00:10:55.648 --> 00:10:58.090]  It's not just the head of the Air Force Academy.
[00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:05.035]  It's it's hundreds of people are quietly being relieved of command right now are being basically sent to the North Pole, as they'd say.
[00:11:05.035 --> 00:11:05.535]  And that's being
[00:11:06.656 --> 00:11:08.357]  done ahead of what we know.
[00:11:08.357 --> 00:11:16.361]  MS-13, the Democrats, Antifa are linked up with terrorist organizations, criminal organizations.
[00:11:16.361 --> 00:11:18.762]  Hezbollah is working with the Democrats.
[00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:20.363]  As you know, the Democrats may deal with Iran.
[00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:30.968]  I mean, they've got some real terror networks in this country that are really seriously prepared and ready to carry out massive terror attacks that will be blamed on me.
[00:11:32.341 --> 00:11:35.422]  You can count your bottom dollars on that.
[00:11:35.422 --> 00:11:40.103]  They'll be blamed on you, they'll be blamed on Trump, but we will be front and center.
[00:11:40.103 --> 00:11:50.087]  So make no mistake about it, ladies and gentlemen, you don't just think I pulled all that out of a hat last year when I told you Antifa was working with MS-13 and others and preparing terror attacks.
[00:11:50.087 --> 00:11:51.207]  They'll just be the decoys.
[00:11:52.537 --> 00:11:53.397]  Okay?
[00:11:53.397 --> 00:11:55.318]  So, targeted assassinations, all of it.
[00:11:55.318 --> 00:11:57.139]  They're really planning this.
[00:11:57.139 --> 00:12:04.242]  You don't just think the Clintons and all these people were just going to push, push, push and then back off.
[00:12:04.242 --> 00:12:08.304]  They're not going to stop.
[00:12:08.304 --> 00:12:14.187]  And if you underestimate how savagely criminal they are, then you will be defeated, we will be defeated.
[00:12:14.187 --> 00:12:16.407]  If we just wake up to the fact that they're pure evil.
[00:12:16.407 --> 00:12:17.348]  And I want to explain something here.
[00:12:18.482 --> 00:12:20.803]  I mentioned it yesterday, but I'm going to get into it more today.
[00:12:20.803 --> 00:12:33.511]  Even CNN admits teen suicides of the exact demographic of low-teen girls and pre-teen girls skyrocketed directly after they watched the show glorifying little girls committing suicide.
[00:12:33.511 --> 00:12:37.553]  Or making it, you know, a romantic thing.
[00:12:37.553 --> 00:12:39.815]  This is a microcosm.
[00:12:39.815 --> 00:12:44.878]  I sent people, and I'm just going to leave it at this, two major film festivals.
[00:12:45.765 --> 00:12:54.433]  Because I already knew this was going on, but they were in the meetings with these individuals this year, at Sundance, you name it, where they said, we get money to demoralize.
[00:12:54.433 --> 00:13:00.539]  We get money to make the most depressing, horrible, anti-American stuff we can, and that is our job.
[00:13:00.539 --> 00:13:06.825]  And they're openly all competing with each other about who can be the most horrible and be the most evil, and they know their mission.
[00:13:07.746 --> 00:13:11.527]  So I'm going to explain to you very, very clearly.
[00:13:11.527 --> 00:13:14.267]  They're saying they want to kill babies after they're born and they're doing it.
[00:13:14.267 --> 00:13:16.728]  They're saying the world's going to end in 12 years.
[00:13:16.728 --> 00:13:20.769]  They're shipping in millions of people, hundreds of thousands of which have serious diseases.
[00:13:20.769 --> 00:13:29.751]  And then if you link to medical reports put out by the CDC and even the Border Patrol, they put up notes saying it's fake news and block it on Facebook.
[00:13:29.751 --> 00:13:31.051]  That happened to us yesterday.
[00:13:31.051 --> 00:13:32.371]  I'll be showing you that.
[00:13:32.371 --> 00:13:36.172]  I was just linking to ABC News and medical reports.
[00:13:37.122 --> 00:13:39.403]  Saying that it's not unvaccinated, that's a hoax.
[00:13:39.403 --> 00:13:40.003]  It's the illegals.
[00:13:40.003 --> 00:13:44.844]  So you have to understand, folks, they are demoralizing.
[00:13:44.844 --> 00:13:47.845]  They are trying to depress you and destroy you.
[00:13:47.845 --> 00:13:50.765]  Hillary was meant to be put in to cause a war between men and women.
[00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:52.186]  That was her whole admitted plan.
[00:13:52.186 --> 00:13:58.587]  She was meant to be ugly and a liar and demoralizing and to make our military give up and to make us feel failed.
[00:13:58.587 --> 00:14:01.548]  They do it all on purpose.
[00:14:01.548 --> 00:14:05.329]  They do it as an exercise of evil.
[00:14:05.329 --> 00:14:06.349]  Just like Brian Williams.
[00:14:07.898 --> 00:14:10.540]  Got up there until he was shot down in a helicopter.
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:14.724]  They were on the ground with people trying to kill him and he was, you know, basically super soldier.
[00:14:14.724 --> 00:14:16.085]  It was all a lie.
[00:14:16.085 --> 00:14:22.730]  He runs the fact-checking for MSNBC now and puts on total hoaxes, total lies.
[00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:27.975]  CNN puts, you know, hundreds of bottles of gum, gumdrops or gumballs and says, like, every one of these is a lie.
[00:14:27.975 --> 00:14:29.656]  It's how you talk to a three-year-old.
[00:14:29.656 --> 00:14:30.777]  They're the liars.
[00:14:30.777 --> 00:14:31.758]  They're the frauds.
[00:14:31.758 --> 00:14:32.959]  They're the enemy.
[00:14:32.959 --> 00:14:34.060]  And they're planning big stuff.
[00:14:35.233 --> 00:14:41.457]  So you just think about how dumb they think you are, that they've got Hillary who pulled a Brian Williams in Serbia, in Bosnia.
[00:14:41.457 --> 00:14:42.818]  You've got Brian Williams up there.
[00:14:42.818 --> 00:14:50.923]  This is how stupid they think you are, demoralizing you, feeding you a steady total diet of disinformation to literally break your will.
[00:14:52.239 --> 00:14:53.799]  But instead, we've got Trump.
[00:14:53.799 --> 00:15:01.882]  And that's why they've harassed and targeted and sued and threatened anyone that supported Trump and anyone that supported American relaunch, thinking we'd all give up.
[00:15:01.882 --> 00:15:10.284]  Or they thought they'd come and offer everybody in his entourage or his support group money, supposedly from the Russians, so they could make their made-up canard real.
[00:15:10.284 --> 00:15:14.405]  No one would take the money from the FBI and from their people.
[00:15:14.405 --> 00:15:17.506]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are winning.
[00:15:17.506 --> 00:15:20.267]  But let me explain this to everybody, and I know you know this.
[00:15:21.474 --> 00:15:26.608]  It's critical that my mission continue on against the enemy and this mission that you're a part of.
[00:15:26.608 --> 00:15:28.092]  And it's critical that Trump continue on.
[00:15:28.789 --> 00:15:31.150]  Because just because we're turning the tide, this is a battle.
[00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.270]  We haven't won the war yet.
[00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:33.470]  We need your prayers.
[00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:36.511]  We need your word of mouth, spreading the word about what we do here.
[00:15:36.511 --> 00:15:40.571]  And we need your financial support at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:15:40.571 --> 00:15:43.792]  And there's thousands of great items, the best products that are out there.
[00:15:43.792 --> 00:15:45.713]  You need to get in there and take advantage of that.
[00:15:45.713 --> 00:15:48.173]  I know you've been doing it, but just know this.
[00:15:48.173 --> 00:15:49.673]  This is a battle of wills.
[00:15:49.673 --> 00:15:51.614]  And we need to be provisioned to this war.
[00:15:51.614 --> 00:15:52.674]  And we need money.
[00:15:52.674 --> 00:15:55.835]  So go to InfoWarStore.com and get great products at the same time.

[00:16:01.474 --> 00:16:02.776]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[00:16:02.776 --> 00:16:03.757]  Hey, whatcha doin'?
[00:16:03.757 --> 00:16:04.838]  Mother's Day, remember?
[00:16:04.838 --> 00:16:05.178]  Oh, yeah.
[00:16:05.178 --> 00:16:09.522]  So I'm making lists, gotta plan a trip to the store, then need to save all the receipts in case she wants to return.

[00:17:28.519 --> 00:17:34.861]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[00:17:34.861 --> 00:17:37.902]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[00:17:37.902 --> 00:17:43.824]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[00:17:43.824 --> 00:17:47.625]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:48.885]  Was there ever a vote?
[00:17:48.885 --> 00:17:50.226]  Who do we fight for?
[00:17:50.226 --> 00:17:56.427]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[00:17:56.427 --> 00:17:57.868]  Available at Amazon Books.
[00:18:00.154 --> 00:18:03.755]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.755 --> 00:18:05.536]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.536 --> 00:18:17.579]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.579 --> 00:18:22.601]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[00:18:22.881 --> 00:18:26.784]  Experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.784 --> 00:18:32.730]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:37.834]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.834 --> 00:18:40.436]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.436 --> 00:18:42.158]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.158 --> 00:18:46.982]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase.
[00:18:47.182 --> 00:18:52.144]  Which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.144 --> 00:18:54.806]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.806 --> 00:19:00.168]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[00:19:00.168 --> 00:19:04.070]  Brain Force Plus is a top tier nootropin.
[00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:07.171]  Focus, clarity, energy.
[00:19:07.171 --> 00:19:12.634]  But instead of having a 7 times markup, we have a 100, a 50% markup.
[00:19:12.634 --> 00:19:14.815]  Right now, it's massively discounted.
[00:19:15.755 --> 00:19:22.096]  And when you get a bottle of it at 25% off, you get a free bottle of what is our total bestseller.
[00:19:22.096 --> 00:19:26.177]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.
[00:19:26.177 --> 00:19:28.857]  And that, of course, is Knockout, the ultimate sleep aid.

[00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:06.472]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:11.204 --> 00:20:19.463]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do that he's mean as a wolverine.
[00:20:29.066 --> 00:20:34.088]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[00:20:34.088 --> 00:20:38.090]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[00:20:38.090 --> 00:20:40.151]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:20:40.151 --> 00:20:42.372]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:20:42.372 --> 00:20:44.373]  John has a long mustache.
[00:20:44.373 --> 00:20:46.414]  John has a long mustache.
[00:20:46.414 --> 00:20:49.255]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[00:20:49.255 --> 00:20:53.397]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[00:20:59.273 --> 00:21:01.153]  But they took a lot of people away.
[00:21:01.153 --> 00:21:03.294]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[00:21:03.294 --> 00:21:04.934]  People that had guns or things they wanted.
[00:21:04.934 --> 00:21:06.454]  They just took them away.
[00:21:06.454 --> 00:21:07.875]  Where?
[00:21:07.875 --> 00:21:08.935]  Re-education camps.
[00:21:08.935 --> 00:21:09.955]  That's what they call it.
[00:21:09.955 --> 00:21:14.636]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents.
[00:21:14.636 --> 00:21:18.156]  Or kids who belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:21:18.156 --> 00:21:22.457]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[00:21:22.457 --> 00:21:23.317]  And we need the kind of camps
[00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:32.803]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[00:21:32.803 --> 00:21:39.587]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[00:21:39.587 --> 00:21:43.670]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:44.730]  would you see that happening?
[00:21:44.730 --> 00:21:48.753]  I mean, we've got a lot of constitutionless and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:21:49.333 --> 00:21:59.279]  Plus you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:05.302]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[00:22:05.302 --> 00:22:09.845]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[00:22:16.616 --> 00:22:19.177]  That's what we're doing here, and let's not kid about it.
[00:22:19.177 --> 00:22:24.239]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[00:22:24.239 --> 00:22:27.440]  Put your gun down, really?
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:32.422]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:22:32.422 --> 00:22:34.263]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:22:34.263 --> 00:22:36.244]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[00:22:38.946 --> 00:22:44.470]  So these people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not.
[00:22:44.470 --> 00:22:47.253]  They're nothing more than domestic terrorists.
[00:22:47.253 --> 00:22:51.156]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:23:05.254 --> 00:23:14.235]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says and what he does and what he doesn't do that he's mean as a wolverine.
[00:23:14.235 --> 00:23:15.458]  Wolverines!
[00:23:35.851 --> 00:23:37.912]  Love it!
[00:23:37.912 --> 00:23:43.517]  Condemned to hell!
[00:23:43.517 --> 00:23:46.319]  Here's to the sentinels.
[00:23:46.319 --> 00:23:49.061]  Alright, let's get right into it here.
[00:23:49.061 --> 00:23:50.102]  I'm gonna do my best.
[00:23:50.987 --> 00:24:00.014]  In the next segment it's longer to lay out Hillary Clinton's public treason with China and understand that stay behind networks, criminal groups in our government.
[00:24:00.014 --> 00:24:01.135]  We're selling us out to China.
[00:24:01.135 --> 00:24:03.357]  The CFR said it'd be the Chinese century.
[00:24:03.357 --> 00:24:05.398]  They said America was over.
[00:24:05.398 --> 00:24:07.420]  We saw Lloyd Blank fine before he left.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:10.783]  Goldman Sachs laughing at Trump last year saying he'll never rebuild America.
[00:24:10.783 --> 00:24:12.444]  America sucks.
[00:24:12.444 --> 00:24:12.844]  Look it up.
[00:24:12.844 --> 00:24:14.586]  He put tweets out.
[00:24:14.586 --> 00:24:15.847]  So this is the attitude.
[00:24:15.847 --> 00:24:17.408]  The globalists had conquered us.
[00:24:17.408 --> 00:24:19.469]  They'd beaten us.
[00:24:19.469 --> 00:24:19.890]  They believe.
[00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:29.179]  And, you know, to them, these are chicken-neck, needle, you-know-what-ed nobodies who criminally got their power.
[00:24:29.179 --> 00:24:32.823]  And so to them, still they know that America's superior to them.
[00:24:32.823 --> 00:24:37.929]  They know that Americans aren't traitors, that Americans love unborn children, that Americans are good, honorable people.
[00:24:37.929 --> 00:24:40.292]  They're threatened by our strength, by our history.
[00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:49.434]  And so to Neal Dicks, excuse me I said it, to these type of individuals, everything is dominating America.
[00:24:49.434 --> 00:24:52.856]  Everything is ruining it, screwing it over, and demoralizing it.
[00:24:52.856 --> 00:25:00.000]  That's the power, that's the spirit of Satan that you see destroy countries over and over again, that the Bible talks about.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.641]  It's real.
[00:25:01.641 --> 00:25:08.866]  And now you look at the Democrats, the world's gonna end, let's kill babies after they're born, kill grandma, bring in all the diseases.
[00:25:10.134 --> 00:25:14.476]  Teach little girls how to commit suicide in all the schools and watch the level of suicide explode.
[00:25:14.476 --> 00:25:22.061]  Put 27% of the kids on serotonin reuptake inhibitors that massively increase suicide.
[00:25:22.061 --> 00:25:24.582]  Democrats are all over TV saying, let's kill babies!
[00:25:24.582 --> 00:25:26.663]  Kill them now or kill them later!
[00:25:26.663 --> 00:25:27.764]  That clip's coming up.
[00:25:27.764 --> 00:25:28.785]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:25:30.277 --> 00:25:32.278]  Evil is coming out of the woodwork.
[00:25:32.278 --> 00:25:34.738]  It's standing up on its hind legs.
[00:25:34.738 --> 00:25:36.639]  It's showing you its teeth.
[00:25:36.639 --> 00:25:41.540]  It's going about roaring like a lion, seeing who they may devour.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:42.901]  Kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:25:42.901 --> 00:25:48.422]  And now they don't know what to do because humanity is waking up to them.
[00:25:48.422 --> 00:25:51.003]  Humanity is saying no to them.
[00:25:52.557 --> 00:26:01.601]  And so they're telling us the Russians are coming, but really it's the globalists, and the EU, and the Chai Koms, and Hollywood, and they were in control of radical Islam through Saudi Arabia.
[00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:17.348]  Now that deal's been turned around, all the Democrats have is Hezbollah, MS-13, their stay-behind networks, the Antifa meth heads, the whole Hollywood-hate-America combine, the Chai Koms economically, the EU, but all those people are easy to defeat.
[00:26:17.348 --> 00:26:19.569]  Their regimes are teetering because they're authoritarian.
[00:26:21.485 --> 00:26:23.726]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:26:23.726 --> 00:26:34.151]  Now, it doesn't make it fun for those of us out there like you that speak out and tell the truth in the face of this because you get attacked, but that's the cost of liberty.
[00:26:34.151 --> 00:26:38.032]  And we're paying a lot lower cost than what our forebearers had to pay.
[00:26:38.032 --> 00:26:42.094]  And believe me, they're proud of what you're all doing out there today.
[00:26:42.094 --> 00:26:44.455]  But this is an incredible time to be alive.
[00:26:44.455 --> 00:26:47.096]  And now they've taken the gloves off with A.G.
[00:26:47.096 --> 00:26:50.738]  Barb, who, by the way, gave them a chance to stand down.
[00:26:51.846 --> 00:27:07.731]  I know for a fact Trump, three separate times, has met with Pelosi and Schumer and others and said, if you just won't raise interest rates, it won't sabotage the economy, and let me defend the border, we can share power, and they're like, no, no, no, no.
[00:27:07.731 --> 00:27:10.872]  And now Trump's given them three chances.
[00:27:10.872 --> 00:27:11.992]  He's talked about it publicly.
[00:27:11.992 --> 00:27:13.753]  Hell, I've had a conversation with him about it a couple times.
[00:27:14.909 --> 00:27:16.771]  You heard him on Hannity last week.
[00:27:16.771 --> 00:27:26.120]  He said, well, I called him and wanted to give him a chance to fix it and just move forward when I won two and a half years ago, but they just, they just, they just, they just, they just want to destroy me and the country.
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:27.882]  So, well, now Trump gets it.
[00:27:27.882 --> 00:27:32.346]  And so Trump understands, but he gave him the third chance with Barr.
[00:27:32.346 --> 00:27:35.669]  Brought in somebody that's been part of both power structures.
[00:27:35.669 --> 00:27:39.213]  Republican, Democrat, brought in to clean up earlier messes and scandals.
[00:27:40.506 --> 00:27:42.147]  But obviously a very smart, capable person.
[00:27:42.147 --> 00:27:48.653]  You can watch that testimony, the guy, if you watch Ted Cruz and him, it's just, these guys are so smart and so slick it makes your head spin, doesn't it?
[00:27:48.653 --> 00:28:00.404]  But the point is, is that compared to the Democrat mental midgets in there that can hardly talk, but they can sure throw words out like, you love Hitler, you're a liar, you're going to jail!
[00:28:01.719 --> 00:28:05.140]  They're too dumb to know when to quit, folks.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:06.740]  They really think they're going to win.
[00:28:06.740 --> 00:28:10.381]  They really think they're going to get away with all of this.
[00:28:10.381 --> 00:28:18.282]  And again, the Democrats, they could be black, they could be white, they could be male, female, they all have inferiority complexes.
[00:28:18.282 --> 00:28:21.583]  The cities they run are literal hellholes.
[00:28:21.583 --> 00:28:22.443]  They're babies.
[00:28:22.443 --> 00:28:28.244]  They have no chivalry, no honor, no intelligence, no learning, no capacity to know when to stop.
[00:28:30.419 --> 00:28:34.262]  And so we're going to get into all of them when we come back, and so much more.
[00:28:34.262 --> 00:28:40.428]  But this is an incredible time to be alive, and Trump is going after them, and they're going after him, and they're coming after us.
[00:28:40.428 --> 00:28:42.750]  So just know, you're in a fight for the Republic.
[00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:44.591]  You're living in history right now.
[00:28:44.591 --> 00:28:47.674]  We just caught them in an attempted coup, and they're not backing down.
[00:28:47.674 --> 00:28:49.095]  It's on, baby!
[00:28:49.095 --> 00:28:50.016]  It's on!
[00:28:50.016 --> 00:28:51.097]  Yeah!
[00:28:51.097 --> 00:28:51.597]  Whoo!
[00:28:51.597 --> 00:28:52.618]  This is it!
[00:28:52.618 --> 00:28:53.039]  Yeah!
[00:28:53.039 --> 00:28:55.060]  Toe-to-toe with the globalist scum!
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:56.141]  Yeah!
[00:28:56.141 --> 00:28:56.542]  Yeah!
[00:28:56.542 --> 00:28:57.823]  This is it right now!
[00:28:59.238 --> 00:29:03.799]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:29:03.799 --> 00:29:05.880]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:07.600]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:14.162]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:29:14.162 --> 00:29:19.243]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:29:19.243 --> 00:29:23.944]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[00:29:24.384 --> 00:29:27.487]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.

[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:40.660]  There's a liberal mob that's coming.

[00:33:51.424 --> 00:33:53.285]  You wanna Trump?

[00:35:21.796 --> 00:35:22.737]  And boom, it's done.
[00:35:22.737 --> 00:35:28.882]  Okay, so let's get into it here.
[00:35:28.882 --> 00:35:33.986]  I remember being awake 25, 26 years ago.
[00:35:33.986 --> 00:35:37.709]  But then as soon as I got on air 25 years ago, people started sending me stuff.
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:44.563]  And I started going to the coffee meetings, and going and hearing events, and going and hearing speakers.
[00:35:44.563 --> 00:36:04.794]  And it was like retired FBI agents, and retired Brigadier Generals, and Major Generals, and all these people warning and saying all this wild stuff, and a plan to demoralize people and break down the family, and megabanks funding communism in the Chinese century, and how they were going to sabotage America so that we couldn't operate, and how we gave them the Panama Canal, and on and on and on.
[00:36:04.794 --> 00:36:06.995]  And then, sort of reading
[00:36:07.958 --> 00:36:21.370]  The actual books that the Council on Foreign Relations has written, they put out a bi-monthly publication, and I was seeing all this, and they were openly saying everything I was hearing out of these people's mouths.
[00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:30.419]  Because I was a libertarian, conservative, pro-gun guy, I knew about the New World Order and all that, but I didn't know that Strom Talbot, you know, was saying America sucks, we're getting rid of it.
[00:36:32.082 --> 00:36:36.504]  Communism's the way to go, and China will dominate the U.S., and we'll put Chinese troops in the U.S.
[00:36:36.504 --> 00:36:45.309]  if need be in the future, and the way we'll do it is we'll say there's an outside threat, and that our government's run by traitors working with, say, something like Russia.
[00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:47.930]  And then, we'll be able to bring Chinese troops in.
[00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:58.116]  And you're reading this, and then you find out the weathermen were teaching this on colleges, and then you learn there were trials, and people got convicted, and you're like, wow, you know,
[00:36:59.781 --> 00:37:03.324]  I always thought of America as invincible and strong, and something like this could never happen.
[00:37:03.324 --> 00:37:18.335]  But then, I sit back and I look at Hillary, and what they're pushing, and what they do, and how they transferred almost all our jobs to China, and how they set up tariffs in China so we couldn't operate, and how they de-industrialized us, and now how they're demoralizing us.
[00:37:18.335 --> 00:37:27.663]  And then I remember being out in Hollywood in some movies, and TV shows and things, back when I didn't care to be in them, like 15, 16, 17 years ago, and they'd say, you know who's buying up all the movie studios?
[00:37:28.323 --> 00:37:32.684]  It's the Chinese government, and they tell us what we can say and what we can't do.
[00:37:32.684 --> 00:37:35.725]  Well, now that's all mainstream news the last five years.
[00:37:35.725 --> 00:37:49.247]  So the communist Chinese are state-run, folks, and they can print unlimited money, and they can buy up anything they want, and under Clinton and Bush and Obama, and that's a long time.
[00:37:49.247 --> 00:37:51.628]  That's three eight-year presidencies.
[00:37:52.677 --> 00:37:55.838]  So that's a long, long time, 20 plus years.
[00:37:55.838 --> 00:38:01.560]  There has been a complete sellout, down to just fumes in the tank.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:14.065]  And so Trump jokingly, when they were calling him a Russian agent during the campaign, he said, I don't care who's got the WikiLeaks, I don't care who's got the emails, whoever it is, could be a 400 pound guy in his bedroom, it could be somebody in Russia, who knows, but okay, fine, Russia, you got him, release him.
[00:38:14.065 --> 00:38:16.466]  It's not about who's got him, it's about Hillary's crimes.
[00:38:18.052 --> 00:38:20.894]  Trump has no history of being in bed with the Russians or the Chi-Coms.
[00:38:20.894 --> 00:38:24.717]  He has no history of espionage like Hillary or a foundation with $4 billion in it.
[00:38:24.717 --> 00:38:29.501]  He didn't have Chinese generals in the White House with suitcases of $30 million on C-SPAN.
[00:38:29.501 --> 00:38:30.682]  That's how arrogant Bill Clinton is.
[00:38:30.682 --> 00:38:32.983]  He's so videotaped all day.
[00:38:32.983 --> 00:38:34.044]  Hide it in plain view.
[00:38:34.044 --> 00:38:36.286]  You're the globalists that took Uranium One money.
[00:38:36.286 --> 00:38:40.329]  You're the ones that destroyed your servers with hammers and all this crap.
[00:38:40.329 --> 00:38:41.990]  Talk about open and shut cases.
[00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:43.812]  You're the ones caught red-handed lying to Congress.
[00:38:46.124 --> 00:38:49.086]  You've just got a bunch of liars like Brian Williams as your fact checker.
[00:38:49.086 --> 00:38:51.827]  I hear they're going to make Brian Williams the head of Snopes.
[00:38:51.827 --> 00:38:55.129]  He's in talks to head up, I'm serious, to like head up Snopes.
[00:38:55.129 --> 00:38:57.550]  That's perfect!
[00:38:57.550 --> 00:39:03.314]  Maybe you can get Pinocchio to do it, but that's who these people are.
[00:39:03.314 --> 00:39:05.815]  It's all about their con game.
[00:39:05.815 --> 00:39:06.836]  Their arrogance.
[00:39:06.836 --> 00:39:10.038]  Can they con you one more time?
[00:39:10.038 --> 00:39:12.439]  The world ends in 12 years unless you give AOC all your money.
[00:39:14.275 --> 00:39:15.155]  Or Beto, all your mates.
[00:39:15.155 --> 00:39:16.056]  The same crap.
[00:39:16.056 --> 00:39:18.076]  These people are jokes.
[00:39:18.076 --> 00:39:19.157]  Mental patients.
[00:39:19.157 --> 00:39:20.217]  Narcissists.
[00:39:20.217 --> 00:39:23.018]  Sociopaths.
[00:39:23.018 --> 00:39:28.920]  And then Hillary goes on... Uh, Rick... What's his name?
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.000]  Um...
[00:39:30.481 --> 00:39:31.082]  Rick Maddow.
[00:39:31.082 --> 00:39:32.543]  I mean, Rachel Maddow Show.
[00:39:32.543 --> 00:39:33.884]  Sorry, I forget the name sometimes.
[00:39:33.884 --> 00:39:35.625]  Rachel Maddow Show.
[00:39:35.625 --> 00:39:37.367]  And, and, and, goes on there.
[00:39:37.367 --> 00:39:39.048]  And, we'll, we'll see.
[00:39:39.048 --> 00:39:40.910]  Tries to act like it's tongue-in-cheek.
[00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:42.251]  Oh, Chinese government, help us.
[00:39:42.251 --> 00:39:43.292]  Help us beat Trump.
[00:39:43.292 --> 00:39:44.893]  No, that's who you've had helping you.
[00:39:44.893 --> 00:39:46.354]  Demoralizing us.
[00:39:46.354 --> 00:39:48.876]  Paying for all these shows and movies on Netflix.
[00:39:48.876 --> 00:39:50.097]  Meant to demoralize.
[00:39:50.097 --> 00:39:51.698]  Meant to make our kids be on drugs.
[00:39:51.698 --> 00:39:52.539]  And commit suicide.
[00:39:52.539 --> 00:39:53.300]  They admit it.
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.301]  China bans all these shows.
[00:39:55.301 --> 00:39:57.123]  Saying it would demoralize and overthrow their country.
[00:39:57.123 --> 00:39:58.044]  And then they fund it here.
[00:39:59.582 --> 00:40:04.566]  Hollywood's like a giant cobra full of venom to attach to your children.
[00:40:04.566 --> 00:40:14.715]  So here's the witch in everybody's face, who has a real relationship with the Chi-Coms, and the whole CFR system, to sell the country out, and she's saying, come help us defeat America.
[00:40:14.715 --> 00:40:20.039]  And remember, the Chinese dictator, two years ago, went to Davos.
[00:40:20.039 --> 00:40:21.841]  And he said, we will defeat.
[00:40:23.158 --> 00:40:37.104]  Trump with the EU power and we will defeat it and oh China's gonna save globalism They're openly organized against us and now Hillary wants to trick leftists to go because she knows China Treason is coming out like yeah, we're in bed with China.
[00:40:37.104 --> 00:40:37.844]  They're the good guys.
[00:40:37.844 --> 00:40:46.728]  Yeah Yeah, see that's how you trick Americans to support an outside power by claiming Oh Trump and the Republicans They've got the Russians on their team.
[00:40:46.728 --> 00:40:48.048]  So we've got the Chi comms.
[00:40:48.048 --> 00:40:51.350]  This is the seduction by this pumpkin-headed demon
[00:40:53.012 --> 00:40:53.753]  All right, go ahead and roll it.
[00:40:53.753 --> 00:40:55.414]  Here it is.
[00:40:55.414 --> 00:41:03.079]  Imagine, Rachel, that you had one of the Democratic nominees for 2020 on your show.
[00:41:03.079 --> 00:41:12.106]  And that person said, you know, the only other adversary of ours who's anywhere near as good as the Russians is China.
[00:41:12.106 --> 00:41:16.570]  So why should Russia have all the fun?
[00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:19.252]  And since Russia is clearly backing Republicans,
[00:41:20.612 --> 00:41:23.053]  Why don't we ask China to back us?
[00:41:23.053 --> 00:41:24.213]  I hear by tonight.
[00:41:24.213 --> 00:41:24.933]  Ask China.
[00:41:24.933 --> 00:41:25.613]  That's right.
[00:41:25.613 --> 00:41:31.314]  And not only that, China, if you're listening, why don't you get Trump's tax returns?
[00:41:31.314 --> 00:41:35.415]  I'm sure our media would richly reward you.
[00:41:35.415 --> 00:41:38.756]  Now, according to the Mueller report... Okay, that's enough from her.
[00:41:38.756 --> 00:41:40.456]  And then she goes on to say more of it.
[00:41:40.456 --> 00:41:42.216]  His tax returns are his private information.
[00:41:42.216 --> 00:41:43.797]  You want to harass everybody in business with him.
[00:41:43.797 --> 00:41:44.517]  We know what you want to do.
[00:41:44.517 --> 00:41:44.897]  You're a terrorist.
[00:41:46.038 --> 00:41:56.777]  Your criminal activity with the illegal server running your own private payout system, pay-to-play at the State Department, through that server as a dropbox you used to sell out the United States is of issue.
[00:41:56.777 --> 00:41:58.961]  Which, you pumpkin-headed demon,
[00:42:00.984 --> 00:42:08.987]  We're going to come back and get into even more on Venezuela, on that intervention that's coming up, how the neocons are trying to set Trump up.
[00:42:08.987 --> 00:42:11.068]  We're going to get into so much more.
[00:42:11.068 --> 00:42:17.030]  And the big water scandal out in California, how toxic and carcinogen-laced the water is.
[00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:21.971]  I thought I was a conspiracy theorist warning people about such common sense things as this.
[00:42:21.971 --> 00:42:24.712]  That is all coming up today as well.
[00:42:24.712 --> 00:42:26.993]  And Leanne McAdoo is going to be in studio.
[00:42:26.993 --> 00:42:28.554]  And we're going to open the phones up.
[00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:30.595]  In the next hour.
[00:42:30.595 --> 00:42:32.236]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:42:32.236 --> 00:42:33.637]  Infowars.com.
[00:42:33.637 --> 00:42:34.557]  Newswars.com.
[00:42:34.557 --> 00:42:39.000]  And I cannot stress to you enough, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.662]  I cannot stress to you enough.
[00:42:41.662 --> 00:42:47.925]  I cannot stress to you enough the importance of realizing that the enemy is working around the clock to keep folks from hearing this broadcast.
[00:42:47.925 --> 00:42:53.609]  No matter how you listen, telling people to tune in and telling them the verboten broadcast is there isn't as critical.
[00:42:53.609 --> 00:42:55.590]  It is essential to victory.
[00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:57.832]  So whatever you do, however you do it, spread the word.
[00:42:57.832 --> 00:42:58.272]  I thank you.
[00:42:59.468 --> 00:43:12.876]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most oppressed.
[00:43:12.876 --> 00:43:23.923]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[00:43:25.214 --> 00:43:27.135]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[00:43:27.135 --> 00:43:31.156]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[00:43:31.156 --> 00:43:35.517]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[00:43:35.517 --> 00:43:39.778]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[00:43:39.778 --> 00:43:42.058]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[00:43:42.058 --> 00:43:43.439]  This country is in a war!
[00:43:44.358 --> 00:43:55.066]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[00:43:55.066 --> 00:43:56.908]  I'm in your hands, you're in my hands.
[00:43:56.908 --> 00:43:59.470]  InfoWarsTore.com, thank you!
[00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.552]  Our grandparents, the great-grandparents, knew that they canned food.
[00:44:02.552 --> 00:44:05.515]  During the fall, so they'd have it during the winter.
[00:44:05.515 --> 00:44:08.437]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTore.com.

[00:47:03.303 --> 00:47:12.030]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:12.030 --> 00:47:14.532]  You lock the door.
[00:47:16.857 --> 00:47:19.362]  Always the key.
[00:47:19.362 --> 00:47:23.691]  There's someone in my head, but it's not me.
[00:47:41.559 --> 00:47:43.060]  We're back on this Thursday broadcast.
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:43.840]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.761]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:47:45.761 --> 00:47:48.343]  I want to get back into this.
[00:47:48.343 --> 00:47:58.588]  Because I know that people that have been in the military, or people that have been in high-level corporate positions, or folks that have studied history know what I'm saying is totally true.
[00:47:58.588 --> 00:48:05.092]  But if you're a new listener, or you're just tuned to regular politics news, that's all controlled spectrum stuff.
[00:48:06.459 --> 00:48:22.840]  Now more and more we've broken the paradigm and now have sophisticated discussions going on on Rush Limbaugh, on Sean Hannity, and the establishment is accurate in that we radicalized them, we brought and showed the success of an audience understanding complex issues.
[00:48:23.861 --> 00:48:29.749]  Not just spoon-feeding the same repetitive conservative talking points.
[00:48:29.749 --> 00:48:32.151]  Let me tell you, the environmentalists aren't wackos.
[00:48:32.151 --> 00:48:33.613]  Their minions are.
[00:48:33.613 --> 00:48:37.898]  The people running it are billionaires that want to steal your land, your property, and control the markets.
[00:48:39.264 --> 00:48:40.785]  And it just goes from there.
[00:48:40.785 --> 00:48:48.707]  The Chi-Coms are bloodthirsty tyrants, the biggest murderers, the most soulless, cold-blooded regime the planet has ever seen.
[00:48:48.707 --> 00:48:51.549]  And they're allied with David Rockefeller's Combine.
[00:48:51.549 --> 00:48:52.649]  He set it up.
[00:48:52.649 --> 00:48:53.649]  He made the deal.
[00:48:53.649 --> 00:48:54.390]  He did it.
[00:48:54.390 --> 00:48:58.871]  They were that close to taking the planet over and just engaging in nightmare activities.
[00:48:58.871 --> 00:49:01.052]  And they cheerlead them at Davos.
[00:49:01.052 --> 00:49:04.573]  And they cheerlead this everywhere in the CFR publications.
[00:49:04.573 --> 00:49:07.474]  You have to listen to me.
[00:49:07.474 --> 00:49:08.855]  This is not hyperbole.
[00:49:09.997 --> 00:49:14.398]  This is why they want us off the air.
[00:49:14.398 --> 00:49:17.419]  Because we made popular what they're actually talking about.
[00:49:17.419 --> 00:49:23.721]  They thought it was all academic and stuffy rooms and that you'd never figure it out, but you did.
[00:49:23.721 --> 00:49:26.402]  And now law enforcement and the military gets it.
[00:49:26.402 --> 00:49:29.123]  And there's no putting the chicken back in the egg now.
[00:49:29.123 --> 00:49:31.544]  No putting the genie back in the bottle for their system.
[00:49:32.475 --> 00:49:34.216]  And I don't just say that to demoralize the enemy.
[00:49:34.216 --> 00:49:34.857]  It's the truth.
[00:49:34.857 --> 00:49:36.418]  They need to give up.
[00:49:36.418 --> 00:49:37.719]  They need to stop.
[00:49:37.719 --> 00:49:39.180]  China needs a reform.
[00:49:39.180 --> 00:49:40.561]  Islam needs a reform.
[00:49:40.561 --> 00:49:43.703]  Hollywood and the dehumanization it's engaged in.
[00:49:43.703 --> 00:49:45.865]  My God, we're killing babies after they're born now?
[00:49:45.865 --> 00:49:48.687]  More states have passed laws to do it?
[00:49:48.687 --> 00:49:51.429]  It's just, it's unbelievable!
[00:49:51.429 --> 00:49:54.111]  And it's done formulaically!
[00:49:54.111 --> 00:49:57.393]  They put out the same talking points in Sweden they put out in the United States!
[00:49:58.277 --> 00:50:05.640]  That families suck, and heterosexuality's bad, and Christianity's bad, and taking care of your kids is bad, or having kids is bad.
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:06.901]  These are bad people!
[00:50:06.901 --> 00:50:13.343]  Death education was set up by the Democrats 30 years ago to teach kids how to commit suicide!
[00:50:13.343 --> 00:50:24.128]  I've always told you about the videos when I'd go out and I'd protest at Planned Parenthood, and there'd always be a black man walk over, a black woman, and they'd say, you don't want to have all these, and they'd say racist stuff about black people.
[00:50:25.902 --> 00:50:27.944]  You don't want to have all these black people around.
[00:50:27.944 --> 00:50:29.445]  You want to kill them!
[00:50:29.445 --> 00:50:33.888]  And I learned there's always local black managers that basically meet with the KKK.
[00:50:33.888 --> 00:50:35.830]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:36.791]  They mean business.
[00:50:36.791 --> 00:50:38.692]  I'm going to play that next hour.
[00:50:38.692 --> 00:50:45.958]  Another one of these legislators came out, and he said, you kill them when they're in the mama, or you kill them later.
[00:50:45.958 --> 00:50:47.559]  Nobody wants these kids.
[00:50:47.559 --> 00:50:49.060]  And I've got clips in Endgame.
[00:50:50.191 --> 00:51:02.159]  of the head of the Texas Psychiatric Bureau saying, we give kids all these vaccines and put them on eight drugs because they've got bad genes, we're getting rid of them, basically.
[00:51:02.159 --> 00:51:04.081]  Man, these people are sick.
[00:51:04.081 --> 00:51:06.102]  And they're out in the open telling you who they are.
[00:51:06.102 --> 00:51:09.524]  They're evil with a capital E, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:09.524 --> 00:51:10.705]  Evil.
[00:51:10.705 --> 00:51:11.766]  Evil.
[00:51:11.766 --> 00:51:12.787]  Evil.
[00:51:12.787 --> 00:51:14.488]  Evil.
[00:51:14.488 --> 00:51:15.669]  And they think you're so stupid,
[00:51:16.906 --> 00:51:22.571]  They've got Brian Williams as the fact checker on MSNBC.
[00:51:22.571 --> 00:51:28.155]  We're going to get to that report coming up when I start the next hour and a lot of other ones I just mentioned.
[00:51:28.155 --> 00:51:32.039]  But let me hit on something that's near and dear to me.
[00:51:32.039 --> 00:51:33.260]  Let's just go ahead and roll this clip.
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:40.266]  Here's David Hogg, the arrogant anti-gun spokesperson.
[00:51:40.266 --> 00:51:40.546]  Here he is.
[00:51:43.593 --> 00:51:54.040]  Getting, um, saying Alex Jones, sorry, I don't want to mention his name, um, when individuals say these things to us, I think it's important for their viewing audience to realize they're simply trying to make money off them.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:52:01.426]  For example, one of the main people in this situation that I don't want to name the name of, but, as you said, is from InfoWars, um, he shouts a lot.
[00:52:01.426 --> 00:52:02.186]  I'll just give you that hint.
[00:52:02.186 --> 00:52:02.646]  He looks red.
[00:52:05.140 --> 00:52:14.966]  He's advertising many of these things, and the power lies in these advertisers to pull out of these fear-mongering, hate-loving people that just want to spread hate and division in America.
[00:52:14.966 --> 00:52:25.773]  For example, on Infowars, one of the main things that he spoke, one of his famous things is saying that, uh, one of his most famous statements was saying that, Tapwater is turning the frogs gay and will turn you gay too.
[00:52:25.773 --> 00:52:27.514]  First off, gay people are awesome.
[00:52:27.514 --> 00:52:29.356]  I don't think that's a problem at all.
[00:52:29.356 --> 00:52:34.179]  And secondly, if you noticed at the end of that video, he advertises water filters.
[00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.241]  Ooh.
[00:52:37.241 --> 00:52:39.983]  Incredible deduction, my dear Watson.
[00:52:39.983 --> 00:52:43.165]  No, everything with him is deception.
[00:52:43.165 --> 00:52:46.907]  And so he's trying to put that deception model into my model.
[00:52:46.907 --> 00:52:50.610]  No, I'm openly saying the water is filled with glyphosate.
[00:52:50.610 --> 00:52:51.750]  It's filled with atrazine.
[00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:53.011]  It will hurt you.
[00:52:53.011 --> 00:52:54.532]  Number one thing you can do is filter your water.
[00:52:54.532 --> 00:52:57.354]  And by the way, we have the highest rated best filters.
[00:52:57.354 --> 00:52:59.476]  There's like five different brands out there that have the highest ratings.
[00:52:59.476 --> 00:53:00.076]  We go buy those.
[00:53:00.076 --> 00:53:01.197]  We sell them to you at a discount.
[00:53:01.197 --> 00:53:02.538]  We have Alexa Pure Pro running right now.
[00:53:04.418 --> 00:53:04.698]  $50 off.
[00:53:04.698 --> 00:53:05.739]  It's already discounted price.
[00:53:05.739 --> 00:53:06.981]  That is the lowest ever.
[00:53:06.981 --> 00:53:08.062]  It is an amazing deal.
[00:53:08.062 --> 00:53:13.688]  And Mike Adams, with his big lab, tested it and found that it's the cleanest and fastest acting he's ever seen.
[00:53:13.688 --> 00:53:15.550]  Stainless steel on top of it.
[00:53:15.550 --> 00:53:17.573]  Stainless steel for the same price.
[00:53:17.573 --> 00:53:22.158]  There's another brand that'll do it, but it's plastic and doesn't even send as much water through the system.
[00:53:26.115 --> 00:53:26.935]  Why is that important?
[00:53:26.935 --> 00:53:32.218]  Because suddenly it's all over the news, not just Flint, Michigan, but California, Texas, everywhere.
[00:53:32.218 --> 00:53:37.721]  The water is so incredibly toxic, hundreds of chemicals, hundreds of drugs.
[00:53:37.721 --> 00:53:38.521]  It's terrible.
[00:53:38.521 --> 00:53:39.962]  And of course they sell the news.
[00:53:39.962 --> 00:53:43.424]  The only way you can do it is to properly filter and you better have the right filter.
[00:53:43.424 --> 00:53:45.845]  But imagine the media calls me a conspiracy theorist.
[00:53:47.247 --> 00:53:51.071]  You know why you better filter your water in Texas?
[00:53:51.071 --> 00:53:53.052]  And you better have your house tested?
[00:53:53.052 --> 00:53:56.235]  Radon gas, radiation down in the limestone?
[00:53:56.235 --> 00:54:01.420]  There are hundreds of towns that have done the test and found that it's as bad as Fukushima.
[00:54:01.420 --> 00:54:03.662]  And you want to worry about us getting cancer.
[00:54:03.662 --> 00:54:06.244]  It's because it's bad water.
[00:54:06.244 --> 00:54:09.828]  You heard about towns that failed because it turned out the water was bad and people moved out?
[00:54:11.049 --> 00:54:13.530]  Well, nowadays you just get cancer and die.
[00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:15.590]  No, folks, you better filter your water.
[00:54:15.590 --> 00:54:21.472]  Up to half the water in this country, whether it's well or not, has radiation in it.
[00:54:21.472 --> 00:54:23.133]  Radioactive particles.
[00:54:23.133 --> 00:54:24.733]  Doesn't do too good for your liver or kidneys.
[00:54:24.733 --> 00:54:26.013]  Let me give you a little newsflash.
[00:54:26.013 --> 00:54:29.715]  You better filter your water.
[00:54:29.715 --> 00:54:30.955]  Yes, it funds our operation.
[00:54:30.955 --> 00:54:31.955]  Damn right I want money.
[00:54:31.955 --> 00:54:33.396]  I'm in a total war with the globalists.
[00:54:33.396 --> 00:54:36.357]  Toe to toe, I can do a lot more with a lot more money.
[00:54:36.357 --> 00:54:40.578]  And so I sell you the very best thing for you and your family that I get good mojo off of.
[00:54:41.755 --> 00:54:42.415]  That's my rule.
[00:54:42.415 --> 00:54:49.499]  Of course I sell you the absolute best thing for you that you number one absolutely must have to fund our operation against the pedophile devil worshippers.
[00:54:49.499 --> 00:54:52.560]  Damn right I want money to fight these pieces of crap.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.261]  Sorry, let's go to these local newscasts.
[00:54:54.261 --> 00:54:55.202]  They're all over the country.
[00:54:55.202 --> 00:54:55.422]  Here it is.
[00:54:57.455 --> 00:55:02.380]  Cancer and water, two words that no one wants to hear in one sentence.
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:16.774]  After a year-long research looking into California water data from 2010 to 2015, Dr. Stover along with her colleagues found that everyday Californians are exposed to contaminants that can cause cancer one drop at a time.
[00:55:17.054 --> 00:55:21.937]  A new study claims that drinking tap water in California could increase your risk of cancer.
[00:55:21.937 --> 00:55:23.618]  They didn't just focus on Los Angeles.
[00:55:23.618 --> 00:55:30.282]  They actually looked at thousands of areas at contaminants in public water systems all over the state of California.
[00:55:30.282 --> 00:55:31.743]  Here's what they found when they looked at that water.
[00:55:31.743 --> 00:55:36.146]  They found arsenic, chromium, radioactive chemicals including uranium and radium.
[00:55:36.226 --> 00:55:42.228]  The study found those contaminants could contribute to about 15,500 cancer cases in California.
[00:55:42.228 --> 00:55:46.969]  California's public water systems could contribute to more than 15,000 cancer cases.
[00:55:46.969 --> 00:55:53.051]  These scientists found those contaminants could contribute to tens of thousands of cancer cases in California.
[00:55:53.051 --> 00:55:57.113]  Arsenic is related to lung cancer and skin cancer.
[00:55:57.113 --> 00:56:00.514]  Exposure to hexavalent chromium can increase your risk of stomach cancer.
[00:56:01.514 --> 00:56:06.815]  Disinfection byproducts can be associated with bladder cancer and other types of cancer.
[00:56:06.815 --> 00:56:12.297]  Now researchers say oftentimes these contaminants are analyzed one at a time and they're found to be safe.
[00:56:12.297 --> 00:56:17.558]  But together, the researchers say the contaminants can be found to be toxic and very, very dangerous.
[00:56:17.558 --> 00:56:19.859]  So we asked, what can you do?
[00:56:19.859 --> 00:56:23.160]  Will maybe boiling water kill these contaminants?
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:24.820]  The answer is no.
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:27.081]  Boiling water will only kill bacteria.
[00:56:28.021 --> 00:56:31.724]  So, our best bet, according to this study, is to filter your water.
[00:56:31.724 --> 00:56:35.708]  But not everyone has access to filtered water.
[00:56:35.708 --> 00:56:37.389]  But David Hogg said don't do that.
[00:56:37.389 --> 00:56:40.032]  I mean, you heard David Hogg.
[00:56:40.032 --> 00:56:44.335]  What's wrong with being gay and dying of cancer?
[00:56:44.335 --> 00:56:48.619]  I mean, the frogs only want to have sex with other male frogs, and then the species dies.
[00:56:48.619 --> 00:56:50.060]  And then you get to have another extinct thing.
[00:56:50.060 --> 00:56:52.042]  But, hey, what's wrong with being gay?
[00:56:52.042 --> 00:56:52.883]  You know what I mean?
[00:56:53.390 --> 00:56:53.850]  There you go.
[00:56:53.850 --> 00:56:56.052]  And that's just atrazine, by the way.
[00:56:56.052 --> 00:57:00.555]  It causes all sorts of other loving mutations that I'm sure everyone's going to enjoy.
[00:57:00.555 --> 00:57:13.123]  The point is, is that we have the best water filtration systems at the best prices that have the highest ratings that cut things down to zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero, zero.
[00:57:13.123 --> 00:57:16.405]  That means non-detectable levels.
[00:57:16.405 --> 00:57:21.088]  And if you're not filtering your water for your children or yourself, you are a crazy person.
[00:57:21.088 --> 00:57:23.130]  And if you're not funding our operation, you're nuts.
[00:57:24.030 --> 00:57:27.112]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, this is done on purpose.
[00:57:27.112 --> 00:57:28.992]  Look at photos of people 50 years ago.
[00:57:28.992 --> 00:57:29.673]  Look at them now.
[00:57:29.673 --> 00:57:31.593]  People look like zombies.
[00:57:31.593 --> 00:57:33.594]  It's been done on purpose.
[00:57:33.594 --> 00:57:36.895]  They add hydrofluorosilicic acid to the water.
[00:57:36.895 --> 00:57:37.696]  That's not fluoride.
[00:57:37.696 --> 00:57:45.339]  That's an electrified acid system that then turbocharges everything and the other chemicals.
[00:57:45.339 --> 00:57:47.780]  They're adding, by the way, other chemicals on purpose.
[00:57:50.188 --> 00:57:57.539]  I want to salute and commend every man, woman, and child that has supported this broadcast over the years and that has stood with us.
[00:57:57.539 --> 00:58:00.583]  And I want to thank all of our sponsors and all of our affiliates.
[00:58:00.583 --> 00:58:02.245]  But I'll tell you like it is.
[00:58:02.245 --> 00:58:04.949]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[00:58:04.949 --> 00:58:05.890]  You're our only sponsors.
[00:58:06.411 --> 00:58:12.899]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[00:58:12.899 --> 00:58:15.383]  So remember, you are the Infowar.
[00:58:15.383 --> 00:58:17.205]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.
[00:58:17.205 --> 00:58:19.187]  When you take action, nothing stops you.
[00:58:19.187 --> 00:58:23.973]  We've got giant specials running right now at InfowarStore.com that are unprecedented.
[00:58:24.574 --> 00:58:32.297]  And if you go there and buy great products that you already need from across the board, it funds the Second American Revolution worldwide.
[00:58:32.297 --> 00:58:35.137]  So I want to thank you for your support, and I want to encourage you again.
[00:58:35.137 --> 00:58:40.039]  Go to infowarestore.com for whatever the product is you need.
[00:58:40.039 --> 00:58:43.220]  We have thousands of them, and it makes this all possible.
[00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:45.321]  Thank you for making InfoWars possible.
[00:58:45.321 --> 00:58:45.781]  God bless you.
[00:58:50.330 --> 00:58:54.433]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[00:58:54.433 --> 00:59:01.497]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[00:59:01.497 --> 00:59:06.320]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:13.224]  The Pro-Pure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system
[00:59:13.644 --> 00:59:19.647]  That will provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.

[00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:55.971]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:16.649 --> 01:00:17.709]  We're good.
[01:00:36.852 --> 01:00:37.813]  Alright, let's get serious.
[01:00:37.813 --> 01:01:00.914]  If you're a radio listener, you were missing out on different clubs of newscast in California where they show the water treatment plants and the green sludge that is all of the Prozac and all the Ritalin and all the tampons and all the blood and all the feces and all the thousands of chemicals and all the cleaning chemicals and everything that runs into the sewers.
[01:01:02.739 --> 01:01:10.505]  And then that goes into the water treatment facilities and they supposedly process it and they have something in California.
[01:01:10.505 --> 01:01:16.530]  Most people in California drink what they call toilet to tap.
[01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:18.472]  Toilet to tap.
[01:01:18.472 --> 01:01:24.556]  And then you wonder why cities under this, the people look like they've been shot with a mutation ray.
[01:01:24.556 --> 01:01:29.981]  Just everyone's like... Because the fluoride
[01:01:30.732 --> 01:01:34.138]  Is added so that the other chemicals are boosted.
[01:01:34.138 --> 01:01:35.420]  It's an adjuvant.
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.902]  And this is all part of a larger plan.
[01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:39.466]  I was let in on some of the secret operations in Singapore.
[01:01:41.311 --> 01:01:45.494]  Where they do advanced neighborhood-by-neighborhood testing with drugs in the population.
[01:01:45.494 --> 01:01:48.437]  But they do some of that here, too.
[01:01:48.437 --> 01:01:55.703]  And China actually has sensors in the sewers that test and track what drugs you're taking or what you're up to.
[01:01:55.703 --> 01:02:07.212]  I mean, this is a very serpentine, labyrinthine, Byzantine system that's very complex.
[01:02:07.212 --> 01:02:08.093]  But just bottom line.
[01:02:10.091 --> 01:02:18.897]  The Globalist said, and Bertrand Russell said, we will put chemicals in the water to lower fertility and make them more manageable, and there's a key word, servile.
[01:02:18.897 --> 01:02:21.379]  Can we look at the definition of servile?
[01:02:21.379 --> 01:02:22.040]  Slave-like.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:25.022]  I haven't looked at it in years, but slave-like.
[01:02:25.022 --> 01:02:27.904]  You do what you're told.
[01:02:27.904 --> 01:02:36.470]  You are a base, goblin-like creature that kind of slithers around on its belly, groveling.
[01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:37.531]  There you go, let's see the definition.
[01:02:40.387 --> 01:02:50.973]  Having or showing an excessive willingness to serve or please others, he bowed his head in a servile manner.
[01:02:50.973 --> 01:02:52.994]  Fawning.
[01:02:52.994 --> 01:02:54.936]  Ingratiating.
[01:02:54.936 --> 01:02:56.036]  Oily.
[01:02:56.036 --> 01:02:57.157]  Greasy.
[01:02:57.157 --> 01:02:58.298]  Cringy.
[01:02:58.298 --> 01:02:59.538]  Slavish.
[01:02:59.538 --> 01:03:01.039]  Craven.
[01:03:01.039 --> 01:03:04.041]  Self-abasing.
[01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:07.123]  And you look at everybody groveling to Hollywood, the servileness of it.
[01:03:07.861 --> 01:03:09.682]  And our country turning into a bunch of servile.
[01:03:09.682 --> 01:03:10.823]  Oh, to political correctness.
[01:03:10.823 --> 01:03:12.024]  Oh, you're a racist.
[01:03:12.024 --> 01:03:13.245]  Oh, I'll do whatever you say.
[01:03:13.245 --> 01:03:16.668]  Oh, you're a homophobe.
[01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:18.549]  Oh, here have my children.
[01:03:18.549 --> 01:03:20.551]  I will.
[01:03:20.551 --> 01:03:31.820]  And then the fact that in this big industrial society, even if they weren't trying to do it on purpose, I mean, I didn't know about the water when I was a kid.
[01:03:31.820 --> 01:03:34.142]  And I remember drinking Dallas water and it tasted like
[01:03:35.953 --> 01:03:37.213]  Like whiskey or something, you know?
[01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:40.374]  It was like a taste of... I remember going to Houston.
[01:03:40.374 --> 01:03:43.615]  You could almost light Houston water on fire back then.
[01:03:43.615 --> 01:03:48.876]  Almost everybody I know that had kids in the 70s or 80s in Houston, you know, had one or two that were deformed or died.
[01:03:48.876 --> 01:03:52.897]  You know, I mean, Houston's a big old toxic waste dump.
[01:03:52.897 --> 01:03:54.738]  But oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:03:54.738 --> 01:04:03.000]  You just need to... You just need to drink up, and you need to enjoy it, and you need to shrivel up, and you need to die.
[01:04:04.665 --> 01:04:11.247]  You can go to Snopes and everywhere and they say, Jones is a dirty con man, a snake oil salesman.
[01:04:11.247 --> 01:04:18.469]  He says the water is poisonous and then he sells filters like, again like, oh did you see how manipulative he is?
[01:04:18.469 --> 01:04:22.270]  He snuck up with, you need to buy one of these!
[01:04:22.270 --> 01:04:29.793]  It's so manipulative, that's why, through the Alexa Pure Pro and the Pro Pure, they're both apples and oranges, they're both excellent, and fullworthstore.com.
[01:04:31.232 --> 01:04:32.572]  It's good water, it tastes good.
[01:04:32.572 --> 01:04:39.014]  But if I really want to treat myself, I like this Italian 2,000-year-old spring Aquapana.
[01:04:39.014 --> 01:04:40.234]  I mean, this isn't drinking Coca-Cola.
[01:04:40.234 --> 01:04:42.254]  This is just sweet water, man.
[01:04:42.254 --> 01:04:44.595]  So, you know, I'm Rolls-Royce-ing it right here, baby.
[01:04:44.595 --> 01:04:46.335]  But let me tell you something.
[01:04:46.335 --> 01:04:49.216]  You're not putting tap water in me, Bubba, ever.
[01:04:49.216 --> 01:04:53.077]  And if you're out on the farm, you know how much runoff chemicals from farming's in that water?
[01:04:53.077 --> 01:04:54.417]  That'll kill you even faster!
[01:04:54.417 --> 01:04:56.058]  But don't listen to me!
[01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:57.298]  Just drink up and die!
[01:04:59.352 --> 01:05:00.753]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:05:00.753 --> 01:05:02.654]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:05:02.654 --> 01:05:03.274]  It is.
[01:05:03.274 --> 01:05:08.137]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:05:08.137 --> 01:05:09.497]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:05:09.497 --> 01:05:11.298]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:05:11.298 --> 01:05:13.800]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.441]  Brain, body, heart.
[01:05:15.441 --> 01:05:16.881]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[01:05:16.881 --> 01:05:18.262]  You've got the children's.
[01:05:18.262 --> 01:05:19.383]  You've got the adults.
[01:05:19.383 --> 01:05:20.363]  You've got the krill oil.
[01:05:20.363 --> 01:05:23.765]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[01:05:23.765 --> 01:05:25.546]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is
[01:05:25.646 --> 01:05:26.767]  We're good to go.
[01:05:49.599 --> 01:05:55.481]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:05:55.481 --> 01:06:05.965]  I just can't do it!
[01:06:05.965 --> 01:06:14.429]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:06:16.693 --> 01:06:30.993]  Attorney General William Barr appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday because the Democrats wanted to yell at him for several hours straight after he decided not to indict President Trump for obstruction of justice because he complained about the Mueller investigation.
[01:06:30.993 --> 01:06:31.493]  Mr. Barr,
[01:06:32.426 --> 01:06:45.837]  Now the American people know that you are no different from Rudy Giuliani or Kellyanne Conway or any of the other people who sacrificed their once decent reputation for the grifter and liar who sits in the Oval Office.
[01:06:45.837 --> 01:06:51.782]  But now, we know more about your deep involvement in trying to cover up for Donald Trump.
[01:06:51.782 --> 01:06:54.444]  Being Attorney General of the United States is a sacred trust.
[01:06:54.964 --> 01:06:56.946]  You have betrayed that trust.
[01:06:56.946 --> 01:06:58.608]  America deserves better.
[01:06:58.608 --> 01:07:00.990]  You should resign.
[01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:02.391]  I have some questions for you.
[01:07:02.391 --> 01:07:06.415]  Okay, well, I think you get the point, and that pretty much went on all afternoon.
[01:07:06.415 --> 01:07:15.885]  MSNBC couldn't even wait until after the hearing to complain about it, so they decided to interrupt Bill Barr's testimony halfway through to tell their viewers that he's a liar.
[01:07:17.945 --> 01:07:26.508]  Again, our intention always is to bring as much of this uninterrupted to you as possible.
[01:07:26.508 --> 01:07:44.192]  Dick Durbin's coming up after Republican Senator Cornyn of Texas, but so much has been said here and placed on the record by the Attorney General that starting with Nicole Wallace, we want to correct some of the record against, of all things, what it says in the Mueller Report.
[01:07:44.292 --> 01:07:46.854]  Ryan, he's literally testifying live right now!
[01:07:46.854 --> 01:07:51.598]  Could you just at least wait until a break or after the hearing to throw in your two cents?
[01:07:51.598 --> 01:07:54.040]  So, um, I'm not gonna dance around this.
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:54.901]  He's lying.
[01:07:54.901 --> 01:08:00.225]  He's lying about what the Mueller report finds around one of the critical flashpoints in the obstruction investigation.
[01:08:00.225 --> 01:08:06.130]  It gets even better because during their live armchair quarterbacking, Nicole Wallace had a little potty mouth problem.
[01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:10.654]  I'm gonna bleep it out, but this went out over the air to the few dozen people who are watching MSNBC.
[01:08:11.854 --> 01:08:19.518]  Don McGahn says to Reince Priebus, which is the third witness to this incident, the president asked me to do some crazy sh**.
[01:08:19.518 --> 01:08:25.421]  I'm sorry to swear, but I think we've got an attorney general lying about what is in the Mueller report.
[01:08:25.421 --> 01:08:27.582]  And my question again is why?
[01:08:27.582 --> 01:08:32.185]  A better question is why does anyone waste their time watching MSNBC?
[01:08:32.185 --> 01:08:40.089]  Meanwhile, James Comey published an op-ed in the New York Times about Bill Barr's testimony and said that President Trump ate his soul.
[01:08:41.030 --> 01:08:48.118]  Even CNN is wondering why he decided to take a break from wandering around the woods and inject himself into the news cycle again.
[01:08:48.118 --> 01:08:59.313]  He wrote an op-ed in the New York Times, James Comey, how Trump co-ops leaders like Bill Barr, which includes saying that Mr. Trump eats your soul in small bites.
[01:08:59.923 --> 01:09:05.027]  First of all, I don't know why James Comey feels the need to weigh in at every sort of large moment.
[01:09:05.027 --> 01:09:05.608]  Yes, you do.
[01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:06.209]  You know why.
[01:09:06.209 --> 01:09:06.949]  Yes, you do.
[01:09:06.949 --> 01:09:07.770]  You absolutely know why.
[01:09:07.770 --> 01:09:10.192]  Well, I'm kind of, I'm sort of thinking about that.
[01:09:10.192 --> 01:09:13.255]  Because he has Trumpteragent syndrome, just like the rest of you!
[01:09:13.255 --> 01:09:25.465]  Joe Scarborough's got it so bad, he just hung up a picture of Robert Mueller in his house alongside members of his family, which was videotaped by his wife and co-host, Mika Brzezinski, and then shared on Twitter.
[01:09:26.386 --> 01:09:28.988]  It's bigger than all the ones of us family members!
[01:09:28.988 --> 01:09:30.709]  Look at that!
[01:09:30.709 --> 01:09:32.070]  And look who we have here.
[01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:39.635]  After Robert Mueller wrapped up his witch hunt at the end of March, CNN's ratings dropped in April 26 percent.
[01:09:39.635 --> 01:09:50.283]  Forbes magazine reports that as CNN prepares to move its primetime studios and operations to a glitzy new building at New York City's brand new Hudson Yards development,
[01:09:50.543 --> 01:09:58.448]  The network saw its primetime lineup drop 26% in April, compared to the same month a year ago.
[01:09:58.448 --> 01:10:13.477]  CNN's total audience in primetime was well under a million viewers, averaging 767,000, which I may add is about one-third of the number of viewers that my YouTube videos get, and I'm just a guy on a laptop in my kitchen.
[01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:18.660]  April ranks CNN's lowest-rated month among total viewers in nearly four years!
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:23.824]  The big mystery is how CNN was able to maintain that many viewers for this long.
[01:10:23.824 --> 01:10:29.708]  You would think that after a few weeks of reporting on the same story every single night that everyone would tune out.
[01:10:29.708 --> 01:10:33.491]  But apparently Democrats have an attention span of goldfish.
[01:10:33.491 --> 01:10:35.093]  They do have one more trick up their sleeve.
[01:10:35.093 --> 01:10:39.296]  However, Robert Mueller himself is scheduled to testify in just a few weeks.
[01:10:39.296 --> 01:10:41.958]  And then I'm sure that they'll finally put this behind him.
[01:10:42.999 --> 01:10:50.665]  I'm just kidding, they're never going to let this go until after Donald Trump is out of office, which hopefully won't be for another six years.
[01:10:50.665 --> 01:10:52.386]  Good job, Mark Dice.
[01:10:52.386 --> 01:11:03.014]  Let me just say, I'm going to focus really intensely next segment and get to some of these clips and break down what happened yesterday and what's happening today, but let me just say this again.
[01:11:03.014 --> 01:11:05.797]  The deep state is never going to stop trying to take this country down.
[01:11:07.130 --> 01:11:10.472]  They're never going to stop trying to sabotage the nation.
[01:11:10.472 --> 01:11:16.176]  It's going to be very, very nasty removing them and prosecuting them, but it has to be done.
[01:11:16.176 --> 01:11:17.357]  They're not going to stop.
[01:11:17.357 --> 01:11:19.698]  They've got 18 fake investigations on Trump.
[01:11:19.698 --> 01:11:23.041]  They've got a bunch of them on me and everybody else that supports the country.
[01:11:23.041 --> 01:11:24.562]  They're trying to demoralize the military.
[01:11:24.562 --> 01:11:25.782]  They're trying to sack the economy.
[01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:29.385]  They're trying to raise interest rates to sabotage the recovery.
[01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:31.987]  They are just engaged in incredible crime.
[01:11:31.987 --> 01:11:34.068]  They want totally open borders.
[01:11:34.068 --> 01:11:36.670]  They don't want anybody vetted for diseases, unprecedented.
[01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:39.110]  They are killing babies after they're born.
[01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:41.271]  That's now the official Democrat Party platform.
[01:11:41.271 --> 01:11:42.071]  I'm not kidding.
[01:11:42.071 --> 01:11:43.751]  Got more clips today coming up.
[01:11:43.751 --> 01:11:46.472]  And they've just got to be stopped.
[01:11:46.472 --> 01:11:49.973]  And beyond that, they are counting on us not having memories.
[01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:51.033]  Maybe they don't have memories.
[01:11:51.033 --> 01:11:53.233]  But Brian Williams said he got shot down in a helicopter.
[01:11:53.233 --> 01:11:54.013]  It was all made up.
[01:11:54.013 --> 01:11:56.414]  He didn't get shot at.
[01:11:56.414 --> 01:11:59.654]  Just like Hillary, but now he's the fact checker on Trump.
[01:11:59.654 --> 01:12:02.155]  And when you actually fact check it, Trump's been honest about everything.
[01:12:03.291 --> 01:12:06.413]  He's flip-flop on a couple issues like vaccines and things, but that's it.
[01:12:06.413 --> 01:12:08.435]  I mean, it's just crazy how they lie.
[01:12:08.435 --> 01:12:11.998]  So, here's Tucker Carlson laying this out last night.
[01:12:11.998 --> 01:12:17.983]  MSNBC, if you're watching today, you may have noticed, could not contain its excitement during the Attorney General's testimony.
[01:12:17.983 --> 01:12:26.089]  During the hearing, Senator Lindsey Graham noted, quite correctly, that Mueller's report found no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia!
[01:12:26.089 --> 01:12:30.652]  Brian Williams wouldn't have it that we cut in to call Graham a liar!
[01:12:30.652 --> 01:12:32.134]  So what have we learned from this report?
[01:12:33.505 --> 01:12:41.249]  After all this time and all this money, Mr. Mueller and his team concluded there was no collusion.
[01:12:41.249 --> 01:12:51.335]  If there's no underlying crime... We're not reluctant to do this, we rarely do, but the chairman of the Judiciary Committee just said that Mueller found there was no collusion.
[01:12:51.335 --> 01:12:53.016]  That is not correct.
[01:12:53.016 --> 01:12:58.879]  That phrase, or the lack of it, it's absence from federal code.
[01:12:58.879 --> 01:13:00.000]  Hold on, back that up.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.021]  It's absence from federal code?
[01:13:03.322 --> 01:13:07.667]  Just made up, and tell us about that RPG that blew the helicopter up again?
[01:13:07.667 --> 01:13:08.468]  Brian?
[01:13:08.468 --> 01:13:10.229]  You think we don't remember you got let go?
[01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:11.771]  And I told people he'd be back.
[01:13:11.771 --> 01:13:16.016]  They'll probably have Jussie Smollett back soon, you know, and say his attack was real.
[01:13:16.016 --> 01:13:16.776]  Oh wait, they are!
[01:13:16.776 --> 01:13:19.139]  They're announcing he's coming back to Empire!
[01:13:19.139 --> 01:13:21.001]  And that it's okay and he was attacked!
[01:13:21.001 --> 01:13:21.762]  Here, let's go back to it.
[01:13:22.697 --> 01:13:27.300]  ...not correct that phrase, or the lack of it.
[01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:34.665]  It's absence from federal code, this no collusion mantra, is so foundational to why we're... Pause again.
[01:13:34.665 --> 01:13:42.711]  The report, which they were forced to tell the truth on because nobody bit on the set-ups, was that no American accepted any offers from Russians.
[01:13:42.711 --> 01:13:47.034]  And almost all the so-called Russians we know were informants and it was set-ups.
[01:13:47.034 --> 01:13:48.315]  Jeez, just go back to it.
[01:13:50.939 --> 01:13:59.161]  Do you hear the pretentiousness?
[01:13:59.161 --> 01:14:00.802]  We decided to flag it.
[01:14:00.802 --> 01:14:03.342]  We're the referees.
[01:14:03.342 --> 01:14:06.383]  You know, we've got Snopes saying that there's no poison in the water.
[01:14:06.383 --> 01:14:08.024]  Jones is a liar.
[01:14:08.024 --> 01:14:09.404]  You know, it's all over the news.
[01:14:09.404 --> 01:14:11.285]  And we say this and we say that.
[01:14:11.285 --> 01:14:11.665]  Continue.
[01:14:12.463 --> 01:14:23.129]  So foundational to why we're here today that we decided to flag it when we heard him use it yet again back into the chairman and the committee room.
[01:14:23.129 --> 01:14:27.531]  Yeah, it's another fact check from a guy suspended for lying.
[01:14:27.531 --> 01:14:31.374]  Don't want to be mean, nice guy, but please get some self-awareness.
[01:14:31.374 --> 01:14:33.455]  It wasn't the only time something like that happened though today.
[01:14:33.455 --> 01:14:38.197]  An hour later they cut away again to say that Barr was a big fat liar too!
[01:14:38.197 --> 01:14:38.638]  Watch this.
[01:14:39.452 --> 01:14:52.865]  So much has been said here and placed on the record by the Attorney General that, starting with Nicole Wallace, we want to correct some of the record against, of all things, what it says in the Mueller report.
[01:14:52.865 --> 01:14:53.565]  Nicole.
[01:14:53.565 --> 01:14:55.988]  So, um, I'm not going to dance around this.
[01:14:55.988 --> 01:14:56.869]  He's lying.
[01:14:56.869 --> 01:15:02.134]  He's lying about what the Mueller report finds around one of the critical flashpoints in the obstruction investigation.
[01:15:04.793 --> 01:15:07.914]  Well, you're turning to Nicole Wallace as a fact-checker!
[01:15:07.914 --> 01:15:09.195]  You've got all the way.
[01:15:09.195 --> 01:15:12.916]  Joe Consha writes about media for The Hill, and he joins us tonight.
[01:15:12.916 --> 01:15:14.857]  I mean, I don't look... I've always liked Brian Williams.
[01:15:14.857 --> 01:15:18.859]  He's very funny, actually, and he's always nice every time I've dealt with him, but... He's also a great storyteller.
[01:15:18.859 --> 01:15:19.859]  He's a full MSNBC.
[01:15:19.859 --> 01:15:21.760]  I mean, he used to be, like, an NBC News guy.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.541]  He still has the voice, but, like, this is pathetic, right?
[01:15:24.881 --> 01:15:25.681]  All right, let's stop there.
[01:15:25.681 --> 01:15:27.362]  The full clip's on Infowars.com.
[01:15:27.362 --> 01:15:28.362]  It's worth watching.
[01:15:28.362 --> 01:15:31.363]  Now, let's go to Pelosi as we go out to break.
[01:15:31.363 --> 01:15:33.144]  She says that, oh, Barr's a liar.
[01:15:33.144 --> 01:15:34.184]  He's going to get arrested now.
[01:15:34.184 --> 01:15:35.364]  Here it is.
[01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:40.046]  He lied to Congress.
[01:15:40.046 --> 01:15:41.506]  He lied to Congress.
[01:15:41.506 --> 01:15:45.448]  If anybody else did that, it would be considered a crime.
[01:15:45.448 --> 01:15:49.449]  Nobody is above the law, not the President of the United States and not the Attorney General.
[01:15:49.449 --> 01:15:51.530]  That's all they do is lie in front of Congress.
[01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:52.150]  He didn't lie.
[01:15:53.070 --> 01:15:54.431]  But my God, she ain't looking too good.
[01:15:54.431 --> 01:15:57.291]  She looks like a reanimated corpse.
[01:15:57.291 --> 01:16:01.313]  Stocks and options trading involves financial risk and is not suitable for all investors.
[01:16:01.313 --> 01:16:04.654]  Hey guys, it's Scott Bauer here, CEO of Prosper Trading Academy.

[01:18:16.648 --> 01:18:26.730]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.

[01:18:40.575 --> 01:18:45.598]  And it comes in easy-to-use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:18:45.598 --> 01:18:47.119]  Warning, though, it's very, very strong.
[01:18:47.119 --> 01:18:48.600]  It lasts 10 hours.

[01:19:03.483 --> 01:19:12.047]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:15.009]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:19:15.009 --> 01:19:16.770]  How can I solve that problem?
[01:19:16.770 --> 01:19:23.053]  So we have air filters at Infowarsstore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off.

[01:19:41.321 --> 01:19:43.142]  I've got two in my home.

[01:20:00.848 --> 01:20:03.469]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:10.672 --> 01:20:11.833]  Big Brother.
[01:20:11.833 --> 01:20:13.634]  Mainstream media.
[01:20:13.634 --> 01:20:15.536]  Government cover-ups.
[01:20:15.536 --> 01:20:17.217]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:20:17.217 --> 01:20:18.878]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:18.878 --> 01:20:23.782]  Live, from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:23.782 --> 01:20:27.064]  Get your motor running.
[01:20:27.064 --> 01:20:29.106]  Head out on the highway.
[01:20:29.106 --> 01:20:33.269]  Looking for adventure.
[01:20:33.269 --> 01:20:34.910]  In whatever comes our way.
[01:20:40.572 --> 01:20:45.436]  Alright, I want to open the phones up, callers, specifically on this issue.
[01:20:45.436 --> 01:20:57.503]  Do you agree with me that the civil war is now spilling into the streets, and the Democrats are getting ready to go hot with their operations to try to remove Trump even more, instead of backing down and suing for peace?
[01:20:57.503 --> 01:21:00.566]  I mean, that's what's happening, but I want to get your take on it.
[01:21:00.566 --> 01:21:02.547]  And Trump clearly has signaled publicly
[01:21:03.436 --> 01:21:06.918]  But he knows it was an attempted coup, that the plotters must be punished.
[01:21:06.918 --> 01:21:07.598]  I was in D.C.
[01:21:07.598 --> 01:21:13.422]  last week, talked to three people, two that met with him personally, another that talked to him and talked to others.
[01:21:13.422 --> 01:21:15.463]  Trump's going all out against him.
[01:21:15.463 --> 01:21:23.367]  And then Barr's up there really trying to end this thing and cover up their illegal spying to a certain point on Trump just to end it.
[01:21:23.367 --> 01:21:24.307]  And they're not going to have it.
[01:21:24.307 --> 01:21:30.571]  And now they're saying that Barr is a liar and that Barr lied to Congress and they don't even say what he lied about.
[01:21:31.111 --> 01:21:40.817]  Let's play that clip of Pelosi again, who, I don't say this meanly, but she looks like dead bodies I've seen of anorexics and things.
[01:21:40.817 --> 01:21:46.701]  I mean, she looks like a starvation victim, and she can hardly talk, neither can Biden.
[01:21:47.577 --> 01:21:51.419]  And I think it's emblematic of this establishment doesn't know when to quit.
[01:21:51.419 --> 01:22:09.246]  I mean, just archetypally Trump with all this energy, you with all this energy, me with all this energy, and then you've got them over there, Nadler and Pelosi and Michael Moore and Hillary stumbling around and trying to demoralize and AOC saying, you know, shut up white people and Ilhan all of them saying white people are bad.
[01:22:09.246 --> 01:22:12.408]  I mean, these are a bunch of nasty, nasty people.
[01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:16.272]  Who really think their evil's working?
[01:22:16.272 --> 01:22:25.300]  But how long do we let them just behave like this and act like this and terrorize everybody when they're the ones that have been caught red-handed doing all this horrible stuff?
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:31.325]  So here's Pelosi again, saying that Barr lied to Congress that no one else ever... A, he didn't lie to Congress.
[01:22:31.325 --> 01:22:34.748]  B, Comey, Hillary, they all did it over and over again.
[01:22:34.748 --> 01:22:40.593]  So the projection, the inversion, the upside-down world of what she says is incredible.
[01:22:40.593 --> 01:22:40.874]  Here it is.
[01:22:41.394 --> 01:22:44.636]  Senator Peter, did the Attorney General commit a crime?
[01:22:44.636 --> 01:22:46.157]  He lied to Congress.
[01:22:46.157 --> 01:22:47.637]  He lied to Congress.
[01:22:47.637 --> 01:22:51.579]  If anybody else did that, it would be considered a crime.
[01:22:51.579 --> 01:22:56.642]  Nobody is above the law, not the President of the United States, and not the Attorney General.
[01:22:56.642 --> 01:23:05.387]  Being the Attorney General does not give you a bath to go say whatever you want, and it is the fact, because you are the Attorney General.
[01:23:05.387 --> 01:23:06.427]  It just isn't true.
[01:23:06.427 --> 01:23:07.348]  Should he go to jail for it?
[01:23:10.506 --> 01:23:23.581]  There's a process involved here, and as I said, I'll say it again, and however many questions you have, the committee will act upon how we will proceed.
[01:23:23.581 --> 01:23:26.204]  So they invested godlike power in Mueller.
[01:23:27.611 --> 01:23:33.534]  And then the guy that was his boss and brought him in to the Justice Department gets rehired.
[01:23:33.534 --> 01:23:40.779]  The Democrats respected Barr so much from the past, because he was bipartisan, they go, okay, we'll basically unanimously approve him.
[01:23:40.779 --> 01:23:50.164]  He gets in, and then all the evidence is they committed crimes against America, against Trump, against me, against thousands of others that got persecuted.
[01:23:50.164 --> 01:23:53.146]  And Barr's like, you need to back off and you need to stop it right now.
[01:23:53.866 --> 01:23:58.988]  Now, you illegally spied and you did all this and Trump will leave you alone if you just, oh, you're not going to stop.
[01:23:58.988 --> 01:24:02.529]  They're like, no, you're a criminal now too!
[01:24:02.529 --> 01:24:09.571]  And they start hanging pictures of Mueller up at the Democrats' houses and worshipping him like he's God.
[01:24:09.571 --> 01:24:11.952]  He delivered uranium to the Russians on the tarmac!
[01:24:13.240 --> 01:24:15.402]  He oversaw the Clinton Foundation!
[01:24:15.402 --> 01:24:23.027]  They had Jeannie Ray, the head lawyer for her foundation, up to her eyeballs, in my view, in espionage, overseeing Roger Stone's prosecution.
[01:24:23.027 --> 01:24:32.833]  Can you imagine walking into the prosecutors, and it's the person that works for the Russians, and the Chinese, telling you you did something?
[01:24:32.833 --> 01:24:39.898]  Splitting hairs over what Roger Stone said in Congress, and now they're saying Barr needs to be arrested.
[01:24:39.898 --> 01:24:42.300]  A toll-free number to join us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:24:43.561 --> 01:24:49.206]  The total free number to join us, and we'll get you on air, it's 877-789-2539.
[01:24:49.206 --> 01:24:52.529]  Specifically on this one subject, are you agreeing with me that this is Goosebumps time?
[01:25:09.810 --> 01:25:14.395]  Ted Nugent said on the show yesterday that clearly they're not backing down, they're not stopping.
[01:25:14.395 --> 01:25:15.977]  Did you watch those hearings?
[01:25:15.977 --> 01:25:17.299]  Foaming at the mouth.
[01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:26.462]  Just acting like complete buffoon liars and going, you suppressed 19 pages, you're hiding it!
[01:25:26.462 --> 01:25:27.922]  And they put it in the full report!
[01:25:27.922 --> 01:25:29.363]  It's a total lie!
[01:25:29.363 --> 01:25:40.306]  Hoping their constituents are so stupid, they're on CNN and MSNBC for weeks saying they hid 19 pages, they didn't release 19 pages.
[01:25:40.306 --> 01:25:42.267]  It's in the report.
[01:25:42.267 --> 01:25:44.487]  None of that 19 pages is redacted.
[01:25:44.487 --> 01:25:49.749]  The addendum or statement, the little political jab that Mueller puts in there,
[01:25:51.172 --> 01:25:54.074]  So again, who operates like this?
[01:25:54.074 --> 01:25:59.057]  Where it's verifiable lies that they're constantly telling.
[01:25:59.057 --> 01:26:08.244]  You have to remember, folks, if you go to blue areas, there's ultra-rich living in penthouses with helicopters, and then there are people defecating everywhere and like zombies.
[01:26:08.244 --> 01:26:10.805]  It's like a movie, like something took their souls.
[01:26:10.805 --> 01:26:14.708]  Like there's an alien, like a Stephen King movie, down in the basement sucking their energy.
[01:26:14.708 --> 01:26:20.072]  I mean, I don't know what it is, but you go in blue areas, man, they look like somebody
[01:26:21.195 --> 01:26:24.338]  Gave them lobotomies.
[01:26:24.338 --> 01:26:26.359]  And they believe whatever they're told.
[01:26:26.359 --> 01:26:27.260]  These are followers.
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:32.744]  These are weak, stupid, lazy followers who are dangerous.
[01:26:32.744 --> 01:26:34.025]  Who are dangerous.
[01:26:34.025 --> 01:26:36.267]  And they're coming for your speech.
[01:26:36.267 --> 01:26:37.928]  They're coming for your kids.
[01:26:37.928 --> 01:26:41.411]  They're coming for everything because they believe it's theirs.
[01:26:41.411 --> 01:26:42.852]  They believe they're the ruling class.
[01:26:42.852 --> 01:26:46.255]  You tune into NPR, CNN, you're the ruling class.
[01:26:46.255 --> 01:26:48.137]  You're the great intelligentsia.
[01:26:48.137 --> 01:26:48.477]  They're not.
[01:26:50.021 --> 01:26:52.122]  What they are is very, very sad followers.
[01:26:52.122 --> 01:26:52.863]  We're going to go to break.
[01:26:52.863 --> 01:26:55.344]  We're going to come back with your calls directly on the other side.
[01:26:55.344 --> 01:27:00.447]  I'm also going to play Democrats, talking about killing babies, how great it is, how the hell they... You're damn right they're humans!
[01:27:00.447 --> 01:27:03.788]  We want them dead!
[01:27:03.788 --> 01:27:04.309]  It's amazing.
[01:27:04.309 --> 01:27:05.990]  That's all coming up.
[01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:09.291]  Please don't forget, we are running a bunch of specials right now.
[01:27:11.664 --> 01:27:16.385]  That are the biggest ever, because I want people to see how great these products are.
[01:27:16.385 --> 01:27:23.927]  And we have a special running right now that is X2, the Deep Earth Crystal, pure iodine that nobody else has, the good halogen.
[01:27:23.927 --> 01:27:25.568]  Learn about the iodine conspiracy.
[01:27:25.568 --> 01:27:27.448]  Learn about the halogen conspiracy.
[01:27:27.448 --> 01:27:28.708]  Learn about IQ and iodine.
[01:27:28.708 --> 01:27:30.689]  Learn about deficiency of iodine and what it means.
[01:27:30.689 --> 01:27:32.449]  It means death.
[01:27:32.449 --> 01:27:39.051]  And learn how the globalists are working around the clock, not just to poison your food and water, to dumb you down so they can control you and turn you into one of their minions.
[01:27:40.196 --> 01:27:40.456]  I don't know.
[01:28:07.839 --> 01:28:10.040]  X2, by the grace of God, we're able to get it back.
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:10.960]  It's the original X2.
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:19.182]  Now, X3 is when we thought we couldn't make this anymore, but we found a deep-earth crystal company, but as long as it's another formulation, you have to call it something else.
[01:28:19.182 --> 01:28:22.262]  So they called it X2+, instead of called it X3.
[01:28:22.262 --> 01:28:28.884]  And then the argument set out that if we added two of the other types of iodine to it, it helps the upload of the pure iodine.
[01:28:30.177 --> 01:28:32.098]  Different strokes for different folks.
[01:28:32.098 --> 01:28:38.102]  You get a free bottle of X3 with a bottle of X2, and the X2 is 25% off.
[01:28:38.102 --> 01:28:43.345]  Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:28:43.345 --> 01:28:45.306]  Infowarstore.com.

[01:28:51.089 --> 01:28:52.150]  Worldwide, baby!
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.741]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:58.741 --> 01:29:02.662]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:02.662 --> 01:29:04.183]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:04.183 --> 01:29:07.144]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:07.144 --> 01:29:12.706]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:12.706 --> 01:29:13.907]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:13.907 --> 01:29:16.848]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:16.848 --> 01:29:19.069]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:19.069 --> 01:29:23.511]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:23.511 --> 01:29:25.852]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:27.452 --> 01:29:28.712]  Maybe not today.
[01:29:28.712 --> 01:29:30.013]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:29:30.013 --> 01:29:33.734]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:29:33.734 --> 01:29:34.834]  Forget bunkers.
[01:29:34.834 --> 01:29:36.655]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:29:36.655 --> 01:29:38.355]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[01:29:38.355 --> 01:29:46.157]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[01:29:46.157 --> 01:29:47.157]  Bold statement?

[01:30:11.161 --> 01:30:13.843]  You've seen the unmitigated attack we've been under.
[01:30:13.843 --> 01:30:15.343]  You're our only sponsors.
[01:30:15.343 --> 01:30:21.806]  And when you don't buy the products that are absolutely the best out there, we aren't able to continue on.
[01:30:21.806 --> 01:30:24.307]  So remember, you are the info war.
[01:30:24.307 --> 01:30:26.128]  I'm not the leader, you are the leader.

[01:30:54.257 --> 01:30:54.697]  God bless you.
[01:30:58.217 --> 01:31:00.979]  Stress is a natural part of life.
[01:31:00.979 --> 01:31:07.264]  Work, family, friends, and everyday accidents can put a lot of strain on the body and your mood.
[01:31:07.264 --> 01:31:09.025]  Don't let life weigh you down.

[01:31:41.701 --> 01:31:44.422]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long.
[01:31:44.422 --> 01:31:44.762]  Go ahead.
[01:32:01.059 --> 01:32:02.960]  Yeah, Alex, I just have to say something, man.
[01:32:02.960 --> 01:32:06.801]  It seems like every time I turn on your broadcast, you're bragging.
[01:32:06.801 --> 01:32:08.222]  It just gets old, man.
[01:32:08.222 --> 01:32:10.643]  I'm gonna shut you down right now, okay?
[01:32:10.643 --> 01:32:12.963]  We're taking calls about your nomination.
[01:32:12.963 --> 01:32:16.985]  Do you understand they're having congressional hearings trying to shut us down?
[01:32:16.985 --> 01:32:19.406]  Do you understand I'm ringing the alarm?
[01:32:20.286 --> 01:32:22.968]  If that was happening to anybody else, I'd be freaked out.
[01:32:22.968 --> 01:32:24.328]  I mean, what's it gonna take?
[01:32:24.328 --> 01:32:25.449]  Us being shut down?
[01:32:25.449 --> 01:32:26.930]  Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:32:26.930 --> 01:32:27.991]  You know what, Alex?
[01:32:27.991 --> 01:32:29.091]  Put him on pause again.
[01:32:29.091 --> 01:32:30.212]  Hey, Frank!
[01:32:30.212 --> 01:32:35.855]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say, we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack, we need your help.
[01:32:35.855 --> 01:32:40.378]  As much bagging as I do, we can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this.
[01:32:40.378 --> 01:32:43.520]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:32:43.520 --> 01:32:43.980]  You understand?
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:45.621]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:32:45.621 --> 01:32:46.742]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:32:47.742 --> 01:32:53.325]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the InfoWars!
[01:32:53.325 --> 01:32:54.065]  Do you understand?
[01:32:54.065 --> 01:32:55.706]  I need your help, Frank!
[01:32:55.706 --> 01:33:01.830]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[01:33:01.830 --> 01:33:04.471]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:33:19.848 --> 01:33:23.932]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:33:23.932 --> 01:33:25.573]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.573 --> 01:33:36.765]  We're going to your phone calls in a moment, but this is what's got the old Democrats so rattled calling for AG Barr to resign, calling for criminal charges against him for supposed perjury to Congress with no evidence, when we've got
[01:33:38.556 --> 01:33:44.180]  Open and shut cases against dozens of Democrats, including Comey, Hillary Clinton, you name it, for lying to Congress.
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:50.024]  This has got him really, really scared because he points out there are a bunch of criminal investigations going into leakers.
[01:33:50.024 --> 01:33:50.405]  Here it is.
[01:33:51.636 --> 01:34:02.446]  Mr. General found that during the department's investigation of Hillary Clinton for mishandling highly classified information, there was a culture of unauthorized media contacts.
[01:34:02.446 --> 01:34:05.609]  During the Russian investigation, the leaks continued.
[01:34:05.609 --> 01:34:09.692]  Leaks undermine the ability of investigators to investigate.
[01:34:09.692 --> 01:34:17.599]  Further leaks to the papers while Congress's questions to the department go unanswered is unacceptable.
[01:34:18.581 --> 01:34:19.823]  Why?
[01:34:19.823 --> 01:34:29.017]  What are you doing to investigate unauthorized media contacts by the department and FBI officials during the Raishan investigation?
[01:34:29.017 --> 01:34:32.183]  We have multiple criminal leak investigations underway.
[01:34:34.488 --> 01:34:38.829]  Thank you.
[01:34:55.575 --> 01:35:02.041]  With that witch Hillary on Mad Cow last night openly saying, Chai Com Save Us.
[01:35:02.041 --> 01:35:04.323]  They've been trying to save you, witch, for a long time.
[01:35:04.323 --> 01:35:05.423]  They're not going to.
[01:35:05.423 --> 01:35:07.565]  You ugly pumpkin-headed demon.
[01:35:07.565 --> 01:35:09.947]  God, she looks like a demon.
[01:35:09.947 --> 01:35:14.111]  Sometimes the cover matches the internals, doesn't it, of the book.
[01:35:14.111 --> 01:35:15.252]  That demon pumpkin.
[01:35:15.252 --> 01:35:16.873]  That evil looking around.
[01:35:16.873 --> 01:35:18.114]  She has a right to rule everybody.
[01:35:18.114 --> 01:35:19.215]  What a witch.
[01:35:19.215 --> 01:35:19.916]  Bottom of the barrel.
[01:35:19.916 --> 01:35:21.057]  Okay, I'm going to stop ranting.
[01:35:22.591 --> 01:35:24.473]  It's just that the war's on, folks.
[01:35:24.473 --> 01:35:25.595]  It's on.
[01:35:25.595 --> 01:35:26.976]  The Democrats aren't backing down.
[01:35:26.976 --> 01:35:28.298]  The CHICOMS aren't backing down.
[01:35:28.298 --> 01:35:29.839]  Hollywood's not backing down.
[01:35:29.839 --> 01:35:30.720]  I'm not backing down.
[01:35:30.720 --> 01:35:31.702]  Trump's not backing down.
[01:35:31.702 --> 01:35:33.844]  This is an incredible time.
[01:35:33.844 --> 01:35:37.388]  Trump's took the Federal Reserve, made them stop raising interest rates.
[01:35:37.388 --> 01:35:38.970]  Notice the economy turned back around.
[01:35:38.970 --> 01:35:41.273]  I mean, this is real, folks.
[01:35:41.273 --> 01:35:42.194]  This is a real fight.
[01:35:43.487 --> 01:35:44.428]  Infowars is real.
[01:35:44.428 --> 01:35:45.348]  Trump is real.
[01:35:45.348 --> 01:35:47.510]  Doesn't mean we're infallible or perfect, but we love America.
[01:35:47.510 --> 01:35:48.631]  We want prosperity.
[01:35:48.631 --> 01:35:49.731]  We don't hate the country.
[01:35:49.731 --> 01:35:51.052]  We're not trying to sell it out.
[01:35:51.052 --> 01:35:54.094]  We believe in its foundational values, just like you do.
[01:35:54.094 --> 01:36:01.379]  And you are all in the arena by listening and spreading the word and praying and supporting the broadcast and being involved yourselves.
[01:36:01.379 --> 01:36:03.160]  You are the men and women in the arena.
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.561]  You are the resistance.
[01:36:04.561 --> 01:36:05.382]  Let's go to the calls now.
[01:36:06.567 --> 01:36:11.771]  We got Neil and Danny and HB and Pastor Sam and Bill and Doug and Gene and Deplorable Hill and Tracy.
[01:36:11.771 --> 01:36:15.895]  That'll be all the calls I can get to because Leanne's coming in, but I will continue with your calls after that.
[01:36:15.895 --> 01:36:16.595]  Who should we go to?
[01:36:16.595 --> 01:36:18.457]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:36:18.457 --> 01:36:19.918]  Hmm.
[01:36:19.918 --> 01:36:21.819]  Let's go ahead and talk to Doug in Connecticut.
[01:36:21.819 --> 01:36:22.900]  Doug, you're on the air.
[01:36:22.900 --> 01:36:24.542]  How will the Dems strike back?
[01:36:24.542 --> 01:36:25.843]  The fight's on, you can tell.
[01:36:25.843 --> 01:36:27.424]  Do you think I'm wrong?
[01:36:27.424 --> 01:36:30.166]  Oh, no, I think you're absolutely right, Alex.
[01:36:30.166 --> 01:36:34.250]  You know, I'm sitting back watching all the news reports and we had our little shooter guy at
[01:36:35.369 --> 01:36:39.292]  College the other day, there, and, uh, what do I see today?
[01:36:39.292 --> 01:36:47.679]  Oh, gee, he was researching Sandy Hook, and right off the bat, I'm like, there they go, putting that out there again, trying to blame everything on Alex Jones.
[01:36:47.679 --> 01:36:51.502]  So, not only do they think we're dumb, they think we're really stupid.
[01:36:51.502 --> 01:36:55.646]  You know, because, I mean, I'm like, you know, everything to me, I doubt it at first.
[01:36:55.646 --> 01:36:59.188]  I mean, they're all CIA wind-up toys, I believe, you know?
[01:37:00.427 --> 01:37:05.190]  Whether directly influenced by the CIA or through the media and who knows what else.
[01:37:05.190 --> 01:37:07.071]  And I want to be clear.
[01:37:07.071 --> 01:37:12.214]  The CIA, the FBI, these are all just like a piece of machinery for deep standards to control.
[01:37:12.214 --> 01:37:19.299]  There are a lot of people at the CIA like Pompeo and others that are good that are trying to turn this around, but it's the left to stay behind networks inside of there.
[01:37:19.299 --> 01:37:24.082]  I'm really concerned that they are going to pull off some major false flags to blame conservatives.
[01:37:24.082 --> 01:37:27.824]  That's why it's critical that we don't take the blame for whatever they cook up when they do it.
[01:37:28.919 --> 01:37:37.122]  That's exactly right, and I mean, I think most of your listeners were all prepared, but we can't emphasize enough to keep carrying, keep training.
[01:37:37.122 --> 01:37:41.163]  Everywhere I go, I start up a conversation about you and the show and the world order.
[01:37:41.163 --> 01:37:43.324]  My wife thinks I'm nuts, but I'm just the way I am.
[01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:44.284]  And most people get it.
[01:37:44.284 --> 01:37:46.725]  Most people get it, especially the high school age kids.
[01:37:46.725 --> 01:37:52.506]  Now, I ran into one the other day who was really awake, knew all about you, knew all about your banning and everything.
[01:37:52.506 --> 01:37:54.947]  So the consciousness is out there.
[01:37:54.947 --> 01:37:57.388]  The media is just trying to push the thought that
[01:37:58.547 --> 01:37:59.548]  Nobody knows.
[01:37:59.548 --> 01:38:00.668]  Everybody thinks Trump is bad.
[01:38:00.668 --> 01:38:03.429]  They're trying to push that, but more people are awake than we think.
[01:38:03.429 --> 01:38:07.190]  Man, what else was I going to say?
[01:38:07.190 --> 01:38:08.691]  No, no, that's a great point.
[01:38:08.691 --> 01:38:10.251]  And listen, I got mobbed in D.C.
[01:38:10.251 --> 01:38:14.253]  by groups of high schoolers that were there, I guess, on field trips.
[01:38:14.253 --> 01:38:14.973]  Mobbed.
[01:38:14.973 --> 01:38:15.533]  We have the video.
[01:38:15.533 --> 01:38:17.894]  We haven't put it out yet because there's so much of it.
[01:38:17.894 --> 01:38:19.855]  Mobbed over and over again by groups of high schoolers.
[01:38:19.855 --> 01:38:21.675]  And it's not about, oh, look, I'm famous.
[01:38:21.675 --> 01:38:22.576]  Who cares about that?
[01:38:22.576 --> 01:38:23.276]  They're awake.
[01:38:23.276 --> 01:38:24.296]  They're involved.
[01:38:24.296 --> 01:38:25.276]  They know what's going on.
[01:38:27.057 --> 01:38:31.119]  We need to be in constant communication with them to mobilize them to wake up others.
[01:38:31.119 --> 01:38:31.659]  And it was great.
[01:38:31.659 --> 01:38:32.240]  They were black.
[01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:32.980]  They were white.
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:33.681]  They were Hispanic.
[01:38:33.681 --> 01:38:34.621]  They were Asian.
[01:38:34.621 --> 01:38:35.121]  They were old.
[01:38:35.121 --> 01:38:35.742]  They were young.
[01:38:35.742 --> 01:38:36.562]  And it's just exciting.
[01:38:36.562 --> 01:38:37.002]  God bless you.
[01:38:37.002 --> 01:38:38.323]  I appreciate your call, Doug.
[01:38:38.323 --> 01:38:40.344]  They're in Connecticut.
[01:38:40.344 --> 01:38:41.925]  Let's go to another call here.
[01:38:41.925 --> 01:38:44.706]  Let's go ahead and talk to Danny in Virginia.
[01:38:44.706 --> 01:38:45.467]  Danny, you're on the air.
[01:38:45.467 --> 01:38:47.348]  Welcome.
[01:38:47.348 --> 01:38:47.728]  Hey, Alex.
[01:38:47.728 --> 01:38:48.708]  Thanks for letting me on again.
[01:38:48.708 --> 01:38:50.129]  I talked to you two weeks ago.
[01:38:50.129 --> 01:38:51.170]  I appreciate you calling.
[01:38:51.170 --> 01:38:51.970]  Thank you for calling.
[01:38:52.913 --> 01:39:00.865]  I was disturbed that in our conversation you said that we couldn't become our enemies by lowering ourselves to their level.
[01:39:00.865 --> 01:39:05.872]  That's what they're counting on, that we have more power and they're going to use that against us.
[01:39:05.872 --> 01:39:07.715]  We have to be willing to do what we have to do.
[01:39:08.687 --> 01:39:12.631]  And the President needs to do things that we may not agree with, but we have to support him when he does.
[01:39:12.631 --> 01:39:15.814]  What I say is that we're not going to stage false flags and blame it on him.
[01:39:15.814 --> 01:39:17.276]  We're not going to do things like that.
[01:39:17.276 --> 01:39:18.777]  That's why we have the moral high ground.
[01:39:18.777 --> 01:39:20.819]  George Washington's example, I think, was right.
[01:39:20.819 --> 01:39:23.042]  I mean, specifically, how low would we go?
[01:39:23.042 --> 01:39:26.085]  I'm not going to target their family, like they do our families.
[01:39:27.472 --> 01:39:39.721]  Well, I don't want to target them so much as take them into protective custody so they can't be threatened by outside agencies to go along with silencing their parents or whoever we have in custody and are trying to prosecute.
[01:39:42.503 --> 01:39:48.586]  I would like to see the President call Congress into an executive emergency session and threaten them with telling them that he's going to declassify
[01:40:08.783 --> 01:40:10.886]  Sources and methods if he has to.
[01:40:10.886 --> 01:40:15.393]  He's already done that and they're so mad dog he has the total proof of their criminal activity.
[01:40:15.393 --> 01:40:20.139]  That they're Chinese agents, that they're on the payroll, that Feinstein's gotten a billion bucks from them.
[01:40:20.139 --> 01:40:24.165]  They don't care that they're so used to power that they they don't get it yet.
[01:40:24.165 --> 01:40:25.047]  That's what's so dangerous.
[01:40:26.451 --> 01:40:30.512]  Right, they're doubling down every chance they get because they think we're going to crumble.
[01:40:30.512 --> 01:40:33.553]  We're going to fight ourselves about what we have to do.
[01:40:33.553 --> 01:40:34.613]  Well, then let me ask you this then.
[01:40:34.613 --> 01:40:36.754]  Okay, let's say in the course of action you research this.
[01:40:36.754 --> 01:40:38.274]  What does the president need to do?
[01:40:38.274 --> 01:40:47.897]  I mean, a very quick thing to do is that if they did start the fight, and they are criminals, and they are globalists, and we're the American team, is that Trump would decapitate, what, about a thousand of them in one day?
[01:40:49.534 --> 01:40:50.635]  Well, I'd take him into custody.
[01:40:50.635 --> 01:40:58.539]  I don't know if we want to decapitate, but we can certainly... But you say you want to not have any rules, then it all turns into a big circus.
[01:40:58.539 --> 01:40:59.960]  The only thing they understand is power.
[01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:01.781]  If you want to... I'm not saying do this.
[01:41:02.862 --> 01:41:04.103]  I'm not a trigger guy.
[01:41:04.103 --> 01:41:08.247]  The point is we're going down a road with them that if they could decapitate us, they'd do it.
[01:41:08.247 --> 01:41:13.471]  So I'm just simply saying the quickest, easiest thing to do is just a command and control system is wipe out their command and control.
[01:41:13.471 --> 01:41:14.672]  They're not Americans.
[01:41:14.672 --> 01:41:18.776]  They're multinational bidders, middlemen selling us out.
[01:41:18.776 --> 01:41:19.577]  You understand that, right?
[01:41:19.577 --> 01:41:20.477]  These aren't Americans.
[01:41:20.477 --> 01:41:22.899]  These are enemy forces in this country.
[01:41:22.899 --> 01:41:28.164]  I would like to see President Trump use the tools and the powers that they wanted to give to Hillary Clinton.
[01:41:28.164 --> 01:41:30.406]  If she were president, she would be a dictator.
[01:41:31.244 --> 01:41:34.379]  I think he has to say, these are the powers you wanted to give to her.
[01:41:34.379 --> 01:41:35.203]  I'm going to use them.
[01:41:35.700 --> 01:41:39.223]  You're going to hate it because I use them, and then you're going to take them away.
[01:41:39.223 --> 01:41:40.084]  And that's a good thing.
[01:41:40.084 --> 01:41:40.804]  We want the power.
[01:41:40.804 --> 01:41:41.625]  Absolutely.
[01:41:41.625 --> 01:41:42.966]  And we're only doing hypotheticals here.
[01:41:42.966 --> 01:41:44.107]  I don't want to go down this road.
[01:41:44.107 --> 01:41:46.709]  I think Trump's been judicious about so far.
[01:41:46.709 --> 01:41:49.432]  The problem is they've been caught in an attempted coup.
[01:41:49.432 --> 01:41:50.953]  They've been terrorizing everybody.
[01:41:50.953 --> 01:41:54.536]  They've got antifa training with MS-13 to start assassinations.
[01:41:54.536 --> 01:41:55.837]  That's confirmed now.
[01:41:55.837 --> 01:42:01.321]  And I'm just I'm just saying they're so it's like it's having a dog with rabies coming towards your kids at the park.
[01:42:01.321 --> 01:42:01.742]  What do you do?
[01:42:05.161 --> 01:42:12.203]  You do whatever is necessary to stop the dog, but we can't fault ourselves for defending ourselves.
[01:42:12.203 --> 01:42:15.023]  What I'm telling you is they're going to blow up federal buildings and blame us.
[01:42:15.023 --> 01:42:17.804]  So I'm not for any type of offensive stuff.
[01:42:17.804 --> 01:42:21.685]  We need to start indicting these people now and they will roll.
[01:42:21.685 --> 01:42:24.866]  But I wouldn't just indict low-level people.
[01:42:24.866 --> 01:42:27.907]  I would go after the high-level ones and just start the indictments.
[01:42:27.907 --> 01:42:30.027]  Trump needs to start declassifying now.
[01:42:30.027 --> 01:42:30.987]  Take the gloves off.
[01:42:30.987 --> 01:42:32.208]  They're not going to back off.
[01:42:32.208 --> 01:42:33.268]  I agree with you, God bless.
[01:42:33.268 --> 01:42:33.648]  Anything else?
[01:42:36.101 --> 01:42:39.562]  Alright, but by the way folks, this is not hyperbole where we've gotten here.
[01:42:39.562 --> 01:42:41.123]  This is not hype.
[01:42:41.123 --> 01:42:43.264]  This is the real world, folks.
[01:42:43.264 --> 01:42:44.164]  This is where we are in 2019.
[01:42:44.164 --> 01:42:57.629]  You have got the Democratic Party whose operating system is, America was never great, it'll never be great, get rid of the borders, everybody that's a conservative is a Nazi, white people are evil, capitalism is bad.
[01:42:57.629 --> 01:42:59.970]  Stacey in the great state of Texas.
[01:43:00.982 --> 01:43:04.005]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[01:43:16.758 --> 01:43:22.744]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[01:43:22.744 --> 01:43:23.445]  I appreciate that.
[01:43:23.445 --> 01:43:25.106]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[01:43:25.106 --> 01:43:25.727]  Tell us about it.
[01:43:25.727 --> 01:43:26.488]  Well, it's really great.
[01:43:26.488 --> 01:43:27.789]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[01:43:27.789 --> 01:43:28.309]  I take it.
[01:43:28.309 --> 01:43:29.050]  It tastes good.
[01:43:29.050 --> 01:43:30.892]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[01:43:30.892 --> 01:43:32.854]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[01:43:32.854 --> 01:43:36.337]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[01:43:36.357 --> 01:43:39.179]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[01:43:39.179 --> 01:43:40.940]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:43.021]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[01:43:43.021 --> 01:43:43.941]  So, yeah.
[01:43:43.941 --> 01:43:46.383]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[01:43:46.383 --> 01:43:49.205]  These are amazing things in ultimate female force.
[01:43:49.205 --> 01:43:50.345]  So, I'm glad you plugged it.

[01:45:02.993 --> 01:45:11.557]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[01:45:11.557 --> 01:45:14.538]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[01:45:14.538 --> 01:45:16.259]  How can I solve that problem?

[01:47:01.332 --> 01:47:04.173]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.666 --> 01:47:10.108]  Yeah.
[01:47:34.719 --> 01:47:37.140]  Leanne Mackett is going to be in the studio with us for the next hour.
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:40.181]  She went to take care of her grandmother for a year, then she took off a year.
[01:47:40.181 --> 01:47:42.462]  Has been living in the woods.
[01:47:42.462 --> 01:47:44.643]  And I saw her and I said, Leanne, you look 10 years younger.
[01:47:44.643 --> 01:47:48.745]  I mean, she didn't look old before, but she looks like when she first came to work here like eight years ago.
[01:47:48.745 --> 01:47:50.626]  And she said, yeah, that's what happens.
[01:47:50.626 --> 01:47:53.047]  She goes, I'm like Rip Van Winkle.
[01:47:53.047 --> 01:47:55.168]  She said, I'm like Rip Van Winkle.
[01:47:55.168 --> 01:47:57.809]  I've not watched the news in a year.
[01:47:57.809 --> 01:47:58.309]  Wow.
[01:47:58.309 --> 01:48:02.551]  And she plunges right into here and we're talking about civil war and death.
[01:48:02.551 --> 01:48:03.792]  And, you know, here's the balance, folks.
[01:48:05.276 --> 01:48:10.059]  I don't want a violent civil war, obviously.
[01:48:10.059 --> 01:48:15.502]  But the globalists on the left are really trying to get that going, and they've been caught doing it.
[01:48:15.502 --> 01:48:20.045]  And so, that's where we are as a society.
[01:48:20.045 --> 01:48:24.848]  And we have to ask, what does the President legally and lawfully need to do?
[01:48:24.848 --> 01:48:29.651]  And I think the indictments need to start right now in haste, because the Democrats aren't going to stop.
[01:48:30.823 --> 01:48:31.784]  And it's just that simple.
[01:48:31.784 --> 01:48:38.052]  I mean, they have the nerve to claim that Trump and everybody else are these criminals when they've been caught red-handed in all these crimes.
[01:48:38.052 --> 01:48:41.336]  And they say we don't like America when they're the Hate America Party.
[01:48:41.336 --> 01:48:41.736]  It's just crazy!
[01:48:43.243 --> 01:48:50.725]  And so the president's been very restrained and I think it's turned out that the deep state's in a lot of trouble because he's been so restrained.
[01:48:50.725 --> 01:48:56.306]  But I can feel and also see politically going into this season that the gloves have to come off now.
[01:48:56.306 --> 01:48:58.366]  And I don't think that means decapitation.
[01:48:58.366 --> 01:49:02.947]  That's a government term for taking out the leadership of the opposition group.
[01:49:02.947 --> 01:49:05.468]  That's what they've tried to do politically with a political hit.
[01:49:06.128 --> 01:49:16.191]  The problem is, if they keep escalating their crimes, it's going to become the duty of the executive branch to move, because this is not a normal political operation.
[01:49:16.191 --> 01:49:20.672]  This is an attempted dictatorship of this oligarchy.
[01:49:20.672 --> 01:49:24.993]  Okay, let's go back to Coles here, who's been holding the longest.
[01:49:24.993 --> 01:49:28.494]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bill and then Lacey and others.
[01:49:28.494 --> 01:49:29.874]  Bill in Oklahoma, you're on the air.
[01:49:29.874 --> 01:49:32.135]  What would you call this period of history we're in right now?
[01:49:34.432 --> 01:49:40.135]  I'll tell you what, it's a fake news cycle, that's for sure.
[01:49:40.135 --> 01:49:42.296]  I got a couple questions though.
[01:49:42.296 --> 01:49:54.102]  One question, why did it take so long for, I think it took like three to four weeks for Barr to get the grand jury testimony to him?
[01:49:54.102 --> 01:49:56.703]  That's pretty ridiculous.
[01:49:56.703 --> 01:49:58.324]  And the other question,
[01:49:59.528 --> 01:50:06.527]  What was the FBI telling and paying the anti-Trump dossier author, what's his name, Steele?
[01:50:08.499 --> 01:50:10.281]  What are those details?
[01:50:10.281 --> 01:50:10.761]  How about to them?
[01:50:10.761 --> 01:50:15.506]  Well, it actually came out a long time ago, but it's over a million dollars.
[01:50:15.506 --> 01:50:22.513]  The word is, I think, three million from the FBI, directly to wives of Orr and others.
[01:50:22.513 --> 01:50:30.901]  So they literally created the group within Fusion GPS and then paid themselves money for creating the piece of Pulp Fiction.
[01:50:33.959 --> 01:50:36.300]  Yeah, somebody's going to go to jail for that one, that's for sure.
[01:50:36.300 --> 01:50:37.501]  Oh, they're all red-handed.
[01:50:37.501 --> 01:50:38.301]  It's just red-handed.
[01:50:38.301 --> 01:50:45.845]  I mean, it came out the time, and that was the last time I... It came out two years ago that the FBI had paid $3 million.
[01:50:45.845 --> 01:50:49.207]  You know how much has been paid in the dossier total by the Democrats and everybody else?
[01:50:49.207 --> 01:50:53.169]  Last time I checked, I think $25 million.
[01:50:53.169 --> 01:50:55.250]  That's good work if you can get it right.
[01:50:55.250 --> 01:50:58.692]  Yep.
[01:50:58.692 --> 01:50:59.572]  Crazy.
[01:50:59.572 --> 01:51:00.693]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:51:00.693 --> 01:51:01.373]  What should we do?
[01:51:01.373 --> 01:51:02.434]  I mean, this is a time bomb.
[01:51:03.740 --> 01:51:12.408]  You know, uh, the easiest way to beat socialism and all this crap is just to keep doing what we're doing, uh, push up their timetables and make them jump the shark.
[01:51:12.408 --> 01:51:15.730]  You only jump so many times before you're worn out.
[01:51:15.730 --> 01:51:16.291]  No, I agree.
[01:51:16.291 --> 01:51:22.196]  We just keep precedence and we take the moral high ground and then we just, we just hold fast and they're going to fall in the end.
[01:51:22.196 --> 01:51:22.857]  They always do.
[01:51:22.857 --> 01:51:23.377]  God bless you.
[01:51:23.377 --> 01:51:25.679]  Great point.
[01:51:25.679 --> 01:51:28.622]  And again, this is all an open discussion, a war game of this.
[01:51:29.346 --> 01:51:31.367]  They're going to pick and choose stuff out of context here.
[01:51:31.367 --> 01:51:32.827]  I'm a nonviolent person.
[01:51:32.827 --> 01:51:35.509]  I don't want any offensive action.
[01:51:35.509 --> 01:51:37.709]  But this is a cancerous outside group.
[01:51:37.709 --> 01:51:41.991]  So I'm saying all options are on the table, and I back the president basically whatever he does.
[01:51:41.991 --> 01:51:44.272]  Yeah, he has my trust at this point.
[01:51:44.272 --> 01:51:50.335]  And, you know, when you're in the foxhole for a long time, too, you just start getting with the program.
[01:51:50.335 --> 01:51:52.075]  Because I know the enemy's evil.
[01:51:52.075 --> 01:51:53.736]  They hate Trump.
[01:51:53.736 --> 01:51:56.717]  And they're coming after everybody, and they're a pack of criminals.
[01:51:56.717 --> 01:51:58.038]  And I think Trump's been tootling it.
[01:51:58.885 --> 01:52:04.811]  But I just want to let the President know that I'm not one of these Monday morning quarterbacks.
[01:52:04.811 --> 01:52:10.477]  I want action and I want action now and I want these people off my ass and off everybody else's ass.
[01:52:10.477 --> 01:52:14.961]  And so, it's unpopular going to Venezuela.
[01:52:14.961 --> 01:52:17.444]  I was against all these wars you've heard about over the years.
[01:52:18.379 --> 01:52:19.680]  This one is in our hemisphere.
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:21.541]  It's on our border, basically.
[01:52:21.541 --> 01:52:22.402]  It's coordinating.
[01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:23.423]  It's working with Hezbollah.
[01:52:23.423 --> 01:52:24.783]  That's in the news today.
[01:52:24.783 --> 01:52:27.926]  That Hezbollah and all the way up to MS-13 into the U.S.
[01:52:27.926 --> 01:52:29.647]  And thousands are starving to death a week.
[01:52:29.647 --> 01:52:31.148]  And they're running over people with armored vehicles.
[01:52:31.148 --> 01:52:32.008]  I don't trust the neocons.
[01:52:32.008 --> 01:52:34.410]  They may try to set Trump up.
[01:52:34.410 --> 01:52:38.093]  I'm just saying, inaction is action down there.
[01:52:38.093 --> 01:52:38.773]  So that's a debate.
[01:52:38.773 --> 01:52:40.554]  Maybe I'll bring it up with Liam McAdoo and see what she thinks.
[01:52:40.554 --> 01:52:44.017]  But that's a whole other show because Trump says he's going to do something next week.
[01:52:45.424 --> 01:52:49.625]  Now, saying he's going to do something means Maduro, who's basically already out of power.
[01:52:49.625 --> 01:52:52.566]  The place is anarchy.
[01:52:52.566 --> 01:52:54.706]  And the place is super rich.
[01:52:54.706 --> 01:52:59.507]  I mean, it's got incredible oil, incredible gas, incredible timber, incredible soil, great culture.
[01:52:59.507 --> 01:53:03.428]  It used to be one of the richest places in this hemisphere.
[01:53:03.428 --> 01:53:06.289]  Seventy years ago, a Venezuelan had more money than a U.S.
[01:53:06.289 --> 01:53:07.869]  person.
[01:53:07.869 --> 01:53:09.610]  Now it's a hellhole.
[01:53:09.610 --> 01:53:10.670]  Because commies run it, man.
[01:53:12.273 --> 01:53:14.915]  I'm digressing, I apologize.
[01:53:14.915 --> 01:53:18.977]  Let's talk to Neil, then we'll go to Lacey and others and Deplorable and Pastor Sam and HB.
[01:53:18.977 --> 01:53:20.198]  Neil, in Minnesota, you're on the air.
[01:53:20.198 --> 01:53:22.379]  What do you think's going on?
[01:53:22.379 --> 01:53:30.164]  I just think it kind of bothers me that Trump would even consider letting them off the hook or suing for peace, as it were.
[01:53:30.164 --> 01:53:30.804]  No, no, no.
[01:53:30.804 --> 01:53:32.926]  He's done that three times behind the scenes.
[01:53:32.926 --> 01:53:39.970]  And he now confirmed what he told me personally years ago on Hannity last week, that he gave them shots, asked them to stop it, and then they just won't stop.
[01:53:40.939 --> 01:53:42.521]  Yeah, and that's what he needs to do.
[01:53:42.521 --> 01:53:45.504]  He needs to bring the full court press against him now.
[01:53:45.504 --> 01:53:48.748]  He needs to bring it to the light of day.
[01:53:49.632 --> 01:53:58.739]  Part of his mandate is to show the American people, the ones that aren't directly tied in like your listeners are, and other people.
[01:53:58.739 --> 01:54:01.401]  Sir, I agree with you, but do you understand what that means?
[01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:04.243]  You understand the deep state might set a nuke off in D.C.
[01:54:04.243 --> 01:54:13.230]  I'm just saying, if Trump starts moving against them, which it looks like he's about to do, you understand you could wake up, sir, with, I mean, there is nothing they won't do.
[01:54:14.176 --> 01:54:18.988]  Well, they're going to do it anyway, so we might as well bring it to a head.
[01:54:18.988 --> 01:54:19.890]  Listen, I agree with you.
[01:54:19.890 --> 01:54:21.955]  I think let's just get this over with.
[01:54:21.955 --> 01:54:22.457]  Exactly.
[01:54:23.195 --> 01:54:29.278]  And one more thing, I would like to see them reform the Department of Education or get rid of it altogether.
[01:54:29.278 --> 01:54:32.160]  Because they are indoctrinating our children.
[01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:35.362]  Oh yeah, the federal government has nothing to do with education.
[01:54:35.362 --> 01:54:39.304]  If the federal government wanted to put out patriotic civics and then it would be adopted by the states, that's fine.
[01:54:39.304 --> 01:54:45.627]  But right now, the federal education is a bunch of anti-American, demoralization, CHICOM written filth.
[01:54:45.627 --> 01:54:46.868]  Absolutely.
[01:54:46.868 --> 01:54:47.829]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:54:47.829 --> 01:54:48.869]  Absolutely, God bless you.
[01:54:48.869 --> 01:54:51.711]  I don't care if the feds are involved in education if the states adopt it.
[01:54:52.870 --> 01:54:54.591]  But you don't do that with federal money coming in.
[01:54:54.591 --> 01:54:56.952]  That's if the states want to do it, they can do it.
[01:54:56.952 --> 01:55:00.553]  Or we could have contests and adopt different parts of state stuff at a federal level.
[01:55:00.553 --> 01:55:02.253]  We don't need centralization.
[01:55:02.253 --> 01:55:04.694]  We need decentralization.
[01:55:04.694 --> 01:55:05.795]  I'm getting angry.
[01:55:05.795 --> 01:55:07.355]  Let's talk to Lacey in Florida.
[01:55:07.355 --> 01:55:08.896]  Lacey, you're on the air.
[01:55:08.896 --> 01:55:09.176]  Go ahead.
[01:55:09.176 --> 01:55:09.696]  Thanks for holding.
[01:55:09.696 --> 01:55:12.597]  I am so excited to talk to you.
[01:55:12.597 --> 01:55:17.039]  First, I want to tell you President Trump is blowing me away with how smart he is.
[01:55:17.956 --> 01:55:19.016]  I'm an impatient person.
[01:55:19.016 --> 01:55:21.057]  I was ready for indictments a year ago.
[01:55:21.057 --> 01:55:31.579]  But what I really want to say is, he waited, he did the right thing, he let Mueller do his thing, he knew he never did anything wrong, and he knew if he didn't wait, they would use it against him.
[01:55:31.579 --> 01:55:33.699]  They would say that he was going after the other crimes.
[01:55:33.699 --> 01:55:39.601]  Sure, and then he collected all the evidence of their crimes, which he's got a full royal house in his hand.
[01:55:39.601 --> 01:55:41.841]  They don't even have any cards, other than anarchy.
[01:55:41.841 --> 01:55:45.282]  But I agree, but see, why aren't they giving up now then?
[01:55:45.282 --> 01:55:46.202]  They never give up.
[01:55:47.745 --> 01:55:51.087]  They won't give up, and they're only going to continue to push it harder.
[01:55:51.087 --> 01:55:54.830]  They expect Trump to cave, and they're wrong about that.
[01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:56.511]  They're so wrong about that.
[01:55:56.511 --> 01:56:00.414]  And he's got now the Office of the Inspector General working on it.
[01:56:00.414 --> 01:56:03.716]  Huber, Huber, whatever his name is, he's working on it as well.
[01:56:03.716 --> 01:56:08.780]  The FISA abuse is going to be well documented, and all the evidence is on our side.
[01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:13.023]  But the media and the Democrats, they're still playing the propaganda game.
[01:56:13.383 --> 01:56:15.225]  And they're pushing it with everything they have.
[01:56:15.225 --> 01:56:16.486]  They're not going to back off.
[01:56:16.486 --> 01:56:16.906]  No, I agree.
[01:56:16.906 --> 01:56:22.591]  It was very telling yesterday, whenever, uh, who's the lady from Hawaii was just flipping out, calling, borrow his names.
[01:56:22.591 --> 01:56:25.313]  He just said at the end, he goes, does it really come to this?
[01:56:25.313 --> 01:56:30.418]  And he just looked the Democrats like he's in there protecting them because they don't want a civil war.
[01:56:30.418 --> 01:56:32.579]  He's in that damn report covers up their crimes.
[01:56:32.579 --> 01:56:34.401]  And he's just like, what is your problem?
[01:56:34.401 --> 01:56:36.002]  You idiots.
[01:56:36.002 --> 01:56:37.604]  I mean, they're just morons.
[01:56:38.527 --> 01:56:43.329]  They're literally praying that their propaganda will work and it's not.
[01:56:43.329 --> 01:56:50.191]  It's not holding on to anyone except for the people that are already completely blinded by it that have been on Team Hillary the whole time.
[01:56:50.191 --> 01:56:51.631]  It's gonna fall back on them.
[01:56:51.631 --> 01:56:53.652]  It's gonna be pushed back on them.
[01:56:53.652 --> 01:56:58.373]  And I think that President Trump is ready to finally start the push, bring the indictment.
[01:56:58.373 --> 01:56:59.194]  We're ready.
[01:56:59.194 --> 01:56:59.714]  We're ready.
[01:56:59.714 --> 01:57:00.534]  We're tired of waiting.
[01:57:02.810 --> 01:57:07.694]  We're going to come back with Maisie Byrd-Haranjo when we come back, but great points and God bless you Lacey.
[01:57:07.694 --> 01:57:12.757]  All I know is everybody better be praying right now to God for providence and for peace.
[01:57:12.757 --> 01:57:19.462]  In Venezuela, in the Middle East here, the world is going into a crisis point and people are showing you who's good and who's evil.
[01:57:19.462 --> 01:57:20.803]  It's an amazing time to be here.
[01:57:20.803 --> 01:57:21.744]  Thank God we're on the air.
[01:57:21.744 --> 01:57:24.126]  We're only on the air because of you listeners.
[01:57:24.126 --> 01:57:24.686]  And I mean that.
[01:57:24.686 --> 01:57:26.568]  People call and say, oh thanks for taking my call Alex.
[01:57:27.754 --> 01:57:29.154]  Thanks for listening.
[01:57:29.154 --> 01:57:30.915]  Thanks for supporting.
[01:57:30.915 --> 01:57:32.015]  You understand, right?
[01:57:32.015 --> 01:57:33.516]  Like, we wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you.
[01:57:33.516 --> 01:57:36.597]  They're trying to kill me, basically destroy me right now.
[01:57:36.597 --> 01:57:37.577]  I always love the audience.
[01:57:37.577 --> 01:57:39.238]  Well, I really love you now.
[01:57:39.238 --> 01:57:42.179]  You're like a life raft in the middle of the North Atlantic.
[01:57:42.179 --> 01:57:43.699]  Don't call up thanking me.
[01:57:43.699 --> 01:57:45.400]  Just pray for the broadcast and spread the word.
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:45.920]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:47.361 --> 01:57:52.923]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.

[02:00:24.423 --> 02:00:26.945]  Well, I'm really looking forward to Rip Van Winkle.
[02:00:26.945 --> 02:00:30.867]  Rip Van Winkle's a lot better looking than what I read about in books.
[02:00:30.867 --> 02:00:34.069]  LeAnn McAdoo is back, like, I don't know, she's like 10 years younger.
[02:00:34.069 --> 02:00:35.110]  She looks like when I first met her.
[02:00:35.110 --> 02:00:39.613]  She didn't look bad before, but she just, like, got in a magic time machine, went back in time.
[02:00:40.874 --> 02:00:42.635]  She's going to be in studio with us.
[02:00:42.635 --> 02:00:44.156]  She's been forest banding for a year.
[02:00:44.156 --> 02:00:45.377]  She deserves it.
[02:00:45.377 --> 02:00:47.198]  So we'll get her take on things in studio.
[02:00:47.198 --> 02:00:48.039]  Continue with your calls.
[02:00:48.039 --> 02:00:48.740]  A bunch of news.
[02:00:48.740 --> 02:00:50.241]  We're taking your calls right now.
[02:00:50.241 --> 02:00:52.382]  Deplorable Hill.
[02:00:52.382 --> 02:00:53.483]  That's interesting.
[02:00:53.483 --> 02:00:55.485]  Gnome to Plume.
[02:00:55.485 --> 02:00:56.285]  In Nevada.
[02:00:56.285 --> 02:00:56.846]  You're on the air.
[02:00:56.846 --> 02:00:58.567]  Thanks for calling.
[02:00:58.567 --> 02:00:59.788]  Good to talk to you, Alex.
[02:00:59.788 --> 02:01:02.170]  Welcome, sir.
[02:01:02.170 --> 02:01:04.392]  President Trump needs to move against the Deep State.
[02:01:04.392 --> 02:01:06.553]  He needs to make an example out of somebody.
[02:01:06.553 --> 02:01:07.774]  I think Brennan would fit the
[02:01:18.004 --> 02:01:25.751]  Why do you think she's so arrogant saying China come help us defeat Trump and Trump needs to be arrested and Pelosi says Barr needs to be arrested?
[02:01:25.751 --> 02:01:31.297]  I mean they've committed all these crimes nakedly and they're still just so arrogant.
[02:01:31.297 --> 02:01:32.598]  They're losing on every front.
[02:01:33.792 --> 02:01:37.015]  I think it's because they think that they still have control.
[02:01:37.015 --> 02:01:44.583]  They still think that the stay-behind networks that Obama put in are still running the show, and they're just arrogant, full of hubris.
[02:01:44.583 --> 02:01:46.384]  That's just what they are.
[02:01:46.384 --> 02:01:47.005]  I agree with you.
[02:01:47.005 --> 02:01:47.906]  Where do you think this is going?
[02:01:49.422 --> 02:01:50.883]  It's not going anywhere we want to go.
[02:01:50.883 --> 02:01:55.367]  It's headed to a civil war if we don't move pretty swiftly.
[02:01:55.367 --> 02:01:56.447]  I think that's what we need to do.
[02:01:56.447 --> 02:01:58.849]  We need to make an example out of somebody.
[02:01:58.849 --> 02:02:00.370]  Legally, of course.
[02:02:00.370 --> 02:02:12.679]  Exactly, and we're not going to start a physical fight, but what if they activate the antivirus, the MS-13, that's admittedly going to kill a bunch of police chiefs or try to kill a bunch of members of Congress and then stage some events to blame it on us.
[02:02:12.679 --> 02:02:13.519]  I think you're going to see
[02:02:14.540 --> 02:02:21.082]  Very smart people that are already in place go into motion and probably catch these guys in the act while they try it.
[02:02:21.082 --> 02:02:24.483]  Well, first of all, you don't want to piss off the patriots of the United States of America.
[02:02:24.483 --> 02:02:25.864]  That's for one thing.
[02:02:25.864 --> 02:02:29.865]  And yes, we do need these individuals to go after the deep state.
[02:02:29.865 --> 02:02:31.886]  We need to lock them up.
[02:02:31.886 --> 02:02:34.367]  Well, I just know these people are a joke.
[02:02:34.367 --> 02:02:36.067]  And again, this is an incredible time to be alive.
[02:02:36.067 --> 02:02:37.208]  Thank you so much, deplorable ill.
[02:02:38.712 --> 02:02:42.216]  Okay, next up, let's talk to Tracy in Georgia.
[02:02:42.216 --> 02:02:43.177]  Tracy, thanks for calling.
[02:02:43.177 --> 02:02:43.558]  Go ahead.
[02:02:43.558 --> 02:02:46.401]  We'll go to Pastor Sam.
[02:02:46.401 --> 02:02:48.003]  Hey, how you doing, Mr. Jones?
[02:02:48.003 --> 02:02:48.363]  I'm good.
[02:02:48.363 --> 02:02:48.944]  Thanks for calling.
[02:02:50.242 --> 02:02:53.323]  Hey, real quick, I have to agree with you.
[02:02:53.323 --> 02:02:55.883]  I believe we're already on the way to a civil war.
[02:02:55.883 --> 02:03:07.006]  Right now it's cold, but I feel as though if it's announced that Obama had anything to do with anything that's been going on with the Russians, that's what's going to turn it into a hot civil war.
[02:03:07.006 --> 02:03:13.468]  Because the way the mainstream media is whipping everybody up right now, you know their number one word is racist.
[02:03:13.468 --> 02:03:18.809]  What way to show that President Trump is racist by him indicting Obama?
[02:03:19.858 --> 02:03:23.979]  Well, that's it, because it was Hillary and Obama that gave the orders for the illegal spying.
[02:03:23.979 --> 02:03:33.360]  It does lead back to them, and that's why Clapper and Brennan went out a month ago and said, hey, we were ordered to by Obama, and I agree that when it leads to that, they're going to try to trigger some type of a race war.
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:40.822]  But the left hasn't been successful getting that race war started so far.
[02:03:40.822 --> 02:03:43.782]  Right, right, but that's what's needed.
[02:03:43.782 --> 02:03:46.743]  They haven't been successful because it hasn't been the right trigger.
[02:03:47.922 --> 02:03:51.207]  Everything else, everybody else can downplay what's been going on.
[02:03:51.207 --> 02:03:53.449]  It can go in one ear and out the other.
[02:03:53.449 --> 02:04:03.062]  But if the beloved ex-president is named when no one believes him, no one believes that he will do anything like this, that is not the difference maker.
[02:04:04.642 --> 02:04:05.222]  No, I agree.
[02:04:05.222 --> 02:04:06.363]  That's the race in the hole.
[02:04:06.363 --> 02:04:07.163]  You said it.
[02:04:07.163 --> 02:04:17.269]  It's because they've got Obama, a former president, and whenever a former president, period, is a big deal, and the first black president, they will be able to spin that, that it's being done because they're racist.
[02:04:17.269 --> 02:04:20.030]  And so I think that's why Obama still moved into D.C.
[02:04:20.030 --> 02:04:22.772]  He's kind of running the show still, running the shadow government.
[02:04:22.772 --> 02:04:24.173]  I think you just, I think you hit the nail on the head.
[02:04:25.405 --> 02:04:28.606]  Sure, and that's why Jesse Smollett is able to do what he does.
[02:04:28.606 --> 02:04:35.827]  This is why Kim Foxx may not have anything done to her, even though the city of Chicago has requested her to come.
[02:04:35.827 --> 02:04:41.308]  You know, we got Leigh-Anne coming up, Tracy, but if you can hold a little bit longer, I want to come back, because you really, you hit it.
[02:04:41.308 --> 02:04:42.208]  I was looking for the answer.
[02:04:42.208 --> 02:04:43.048]  That's it.
[02:04:43.048 --> 02:04:44.849]  Tracy answered the question.
[02:04:44.849 --> 02:04:45.869]  If you can stay, fine.
[02:04:45.869 --> 02:04:46.569]  If not, you got to go.
[02:04:46.569 --> 02:04:47.269]  I understand.
[02:04:47.269 --> 02:04:47.949]  Leigh-Anne's coming in.
[02:04:47.949 --> 02:04:48.809]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:04:48.809 --> 02:04:50.670]  We're going to host the fourth hour with her as well.
[02:04:50.670 --> 02:04:51.910]  So get strapped in, folks.
[02:04:56.209 --> 02:05:05.497]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, you name it, that it lowers IQ.
[02:05:05.497 --> 02:05:08.360]  It literally dumbs the population down.
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:14.426]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[02:05:15.086 --> 02:05:21.330]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good, but hard to source, and the Globels tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[02:05:21.330 --> 02:05:27.613]  So we discovered deep-earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2 that's been incredible.
[02:05:27.613 --> 02:05:34.557]  Now, due to the Establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep-earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[02:05:35.718 --> 02:05:48.742]  Chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[02:05:48.742 --> 02:05:52.983]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[02:05:52.983 --> 02:05:55.684]  X3, now available at emploreslife.com.
[02:06:04.015 --> 02:06:14.760]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:31.108]  ...policies and practices, and whether you have demonstrated sufficient impartiality to continue to oversee the 14 other criminal matters that the special counsel referred to in other parts, to other parts of the Department of Justice.
[02:06:32.435 --> 02:06:38.358]  But now, we know more about your deep involvement in trying to cover up for Donald Trump.
[02:06:38.358 --> 02:06:41.580]  Being Attorney General of the United States is a sacred trust.
[02:06:41.580 --> 02:06:43.581]  You have betrayed that trust.
[02:06:43.581 --> 02:06:45.783]  America deserves better.
[02:06:45.783 --> 02:06:46.823]  You should resign.
[02:06:46.823 --> 02:06:49.125]  I have some questions for you.
[02:06:49.125 --> 02:06:57.309]  Is the White House exerting any influence on your decision whether to allow Special Counsel Mueller to testify in Congress and when?
[02:06:57.309 --> 02:06:57.349]  No.
[02:06:59.707 --> 02:07:08.551]  Now you've been clear today that you don't think that any of the 10 episodes of possible obstruction that the special counsel outlined is a crime.
[02:07:08.551 --> 02:07:10.312]  I disagree.
[02:07:10.312 --> 02:07:16.075]  But you seem to think that if it's not a crime, then there's no problem.
[02:07:16.075 --> 02:07:18.616]  Nothing to see here, nothing to worry about.
[02:07:19.685 --> 02:07:26.809]  So with apologies to Adam Schiff, do you think all of the things that President Trump did are okay?
[02:07:26.809 --> 02:07:29.610]  Are they what the President of the United States should be doing?
[02:07:29.610 --> 02:07:39.835]  For example, do you think it's okay for a president to fire an FBI director to stop him from investigating links between his campaign and Russia?
[02:07:39.835 --> 02:07:41.676]  It may not be a crime, but do you think it's okay?
[02:07:42.506 --> 02:07:49.550]  Well, I think the report is clear that... No, I'm not talking about the report and its analysis of whether a crime occurred.
[02:07:49.550 --> 02:07:50.371]  I'm asking you.
[02:07:50.371 --> 02:07:57.355]  This is not a crime, but do you think it's okay for the President to do what he did, to fire the special counsel, to keep them from investigating?
[02:07:57.355 --> 02:08:02.618]  I do think it's okay for the President to do what he did, and I don't think the evidence supports the proposition that he did it to stop the investigation.
[02:08:02.618 --> 02:08:03.879]  So I guess you think it's okay.
[02:08:03.879 --> 02:08:07.681]  Do you think it's okay for a President to ask his White House counsel to lie?
[02:08:09.722 --> 02:08:14.244]  Um, well, I'm willing to talk about what's criminal.
[02:08:14.244 --> 02:08:17.205]  No, we've already acknowledged that you think it was not a crime.
[02:08:17.205 --> 02:08:19.506]  I'm just asking whether you think it's okay.
[02:08:19.506 --> 02:08:25.269]  Even if it's not a crime, do you think it's okay for the president to ask his White House counsel to lie?
[02:08:27.444 --> 02:08:31.628]  Look, if you're just going to go back to where you were last time, you're telling me that it's okay.
[02:08:31.628 --> 02:08:35.190]  Let me ask you the last question that I have in 17 seconds.
[02:08:35.190 --> 02:08:45.959]  Do you think it's okay for a president to offer pardons to people who don't testify against him, to threaten the family of someone who does?
[02:08:45.959 --> 02:08:49.802]  Is that okay?
[02:08:49.802 --> 02:08:52.485]  When did he offer a pardon to someone?
[02:08:52.485 --> 02:08:54.506]  I think you know what I'm talking about.
[02:08:54.506 --> 02:08:55.007]  Please.
[02:08:56.273 --> 02:09:00.822]  Please, Mr. Attorney General, you know, give us some credit for knowing what the hell is going on around here with you.
[02:09:00.822 --> 02:09:01.203]  Not really.
[02:09:03.513 --> 02:09:05.053]  To this line of questioning.
[02:09:05.053 --> 02:09:07.674]  Listen, you slandered this man.
[02:09:07.674 --> 02:09:11.095]  Yeah, what I sort of want to know is how do we get to this point?
[02:09:11.095 --> 02:09:15.036]  I do not think that I slandered anyone.
[02:09:15.036 --> 02:09:17.176]  Mr. Chairman, I am done.
[02:09:17.176 --> 02:09:18.017]  Thank you very much.
[02:09:18.017 --> 02:09:22.538]  You slandered this man from top to bottom.
[02:09:22.538 --> 02:09:24.958]  So if you want more of this, you're not going to get it.
[02:09:24.958 --> 02:09:26.559]  If you want to ask him questions, you can't.
[02:09:28.809 --> 02:09:39.432]  I think this hearing today has been quite revealing to anyone watching it, although perhaps not for the reasons some of the Democratic Senators intended.
[02:09:39.432 --> 02:09:49.434]  One thing that's revealing in the discussion and questions that came up, a word that occurred, almost none at all, is the word Russia.
[02:09:49.434 --> 02:09:55.796]  For two and a half years we heard Democratic Senators going on and on and on about Russia collusion.
[02:09:55.796 --> 02:09:56.256]  We heard
[02:09:57.870 --> 02:10:02.453]  Journalists going on and on and on about Russia collusion.
[02:10:02.453 --> 02:10:08.257]  Alleging, among other things, some using extreme rhetoric, calling the President a traitor.
[02:10:08.257 --> 02:10:11.219]  We heard very little of that in this hearing today.
[02:10:11.219 --> 02:10:23.247]  Instead, the principal attack that Democratic Senators have marshaled upon you concerns this March 27th letter from Robert Mueller.
[02:10:25.618 --> 02:10:29.339]  And it's an attack that I want people to understand just how revealing it is.
[02:10:29.339 --> 02:10:33.920]  If this is their whole argument, they ain't got nothing.
[02:10:33.920 --> 02:10:35.321]  So their argument is as follows.
[02:10:35.321 --> 02:10:40.282]  Let me see if I understand it correctly.
[02:10:40.282 --> 02:10:48.585]  You initially, when you received the Mueller Report, released to Congress and the public a four-page summary of the conclusions.
[02:10:48.585 --> 02:10:49.385]  Then, on March 27th,
[02:10:51.092 --> 02:10:59.155]  Mr. Mueller asked you to release an additional 19 pages, the introduction and summary that he had drafted.
[02:10:59.155 --> 02:11:08.479]  And indeed, in the letter what he says is, quote, I am requesting that you provide these materials to Congress and authorize their public release at this time.
[02:11:08.479 --> 02:11:16.523]  And the reason he says it is to, is that it, is that to fully capture the context, nature, and substance of the office's work and conclusion.
[02:11:17.717 --> 02:11:20.659]  So you did not release those 19 pages at that time.
[02:11:20.659 --> 02:11:27.763]  Instead, a couple of weeks later, you released 448 pages.
[02:11:27.763 --> 02:11:33.026]  The entire report, which includes those 19 pages.
[02:11:33.026 --> 02:11:34.467]  Do I have that timeline correct?
[02:11:34.467 --> 02:11:36.148]  That's right.
[02:11:36.148 --> 02:11:42.571]  So their entire argument is, General Barr, you suppressed the 19 pages,
[02:11:44.557 --> 02:11:54.705]  That are entirely public, that we have, that we can read, that they know every word of it, and their complaint is it was delayed a few weeks.
[02:11:54.705 --> 02:12:05.995]  And that was because of your decision not to release the report piecemeal, but rather to release those 19 pages with the entire 448 pages produced by the special counsel.
[02:12:05.995 --> 02:12:06.996]  Yes.
[02:12:06.996 --> 02:12:08.397]  If that is their argument,
[02:12:12.429 --> 02:12:16.890]  I have to say that is an exceptionally weak argument.
[02:12:16.890 --> 02:12:21.891]  Because if you're hiding something, I'll tell you right now, General Barr, you're doing a very lousy job of hiding it.
[02:12:21.891 --> 02:12:27.572]  Because the thing that they're suggesting you hid, you released to Congress and the American people.
[02:12:27.572 --> 02:12:35.494]  And so if anyone wants to know what's in those 19 pages that are being so breathlessly, oh, Bob Mueller said release the 19 pages, you did.
[02:12:35.494 --> 02:12:37.374]  You did it a couple of weeks later.
[02:12:37.374 --> 02:12:40.895]  But we can read every word of the 19 pages along with the full report.
[02:12:43.996 --> 02:12:47.338]  In your judgment, was the Mueller Report thorough?
[02:12:47.338 --> 02:12:48.239]  Yes.
[02:12:48.239 --> 02:13:07.851]  Did they expend enormous time, energy, and resources investigating and producing... Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:13:09.517 --> 02:13:12.821]  Okay, I'm going to wait to comment on this to the start of the fourth hour.
[02:13:12.821 --> 02:13:17.045]  Maybe we can send Drudge an email.
[02:13:17.045 --> 02:13:29.519]  Sometimes when I tell him to specifically comment on something, he's nice enough to give us that additional forum to communicate with the press and the president and the public, because Drudge is the water cooler of the planet.
[02:13:32.788 --> 02:13:36.851]  It was always a hoax that we were completely banned on Facebook and YouTube and all these places.
[02:13:36.851 --> 02:13:40.214]  Apple did say completely off our platforms, including the app.
[02:13:40.214 --> 02:13:46.038]  They claimed false strikes on our YouTube and false strikes on Facebook's.
[02:13:46.038 --> 02:13:52.884]  They said I beat up a 10-year-old kid and then they showed some ABC News footage of another guy in another city with a kid attacking him.
[02:13:52.884 --> 02:13:54.325]  The guy pushes the kid back down.
[02:13:55.808 --> 02:14:00.510]  And then even when Jack Dorsey was on Joe Rogan a few months ago, they said, why is Alex Jones banned?
[02:14:00.510 --> 02:14:02.471]  He goes, well, he child endangerment.
[02:14:02.471 --> 02:14:04.252]  He beat up a small child.
[02:14:04.252 --> 02:14:06.193]  Just, I mean, it's insane.
[02:14:06.193 --> 02:14:08.755]  Well, but I kept explaining, but that's only those pages.
[02:14:08.755 --> 02:14:17.299]  Well, Oliver Dorsey, the literal rat-like creature that slithers around policing and harassing conservative sponsors,
[02:14:19.031 --> 02:14:25.395]  In coordination, they banned Louis Farrakhan, so they can then go anti-Semite and say all that, and mix my name in with it.
[02:14:25.395 --> 02:14:28.196]  Milo Yiannopoulos and Infowars.
[02:14:28.196 --> 02:14:36.521]  My personal page, that we didn't really update, but it was our personal page, and a bunch of old pages associated with films like Endgame and...
[02:14:37.401 --> 02:14:41.662]  TerrorStorm and others from its platform as dangerous.
[02:14:41.662 --> 02:14:46.163]  So the new thing is they're calling things false news, not fake news, and they're calling it dangerous.
[02:14:46.163 --> 02:14:47.584]  And they slander me.
[02:14:47.584 --> 02:14:48.384]  No email came in.
[02:14:48.384 --> 02:14:49.784]  They just have locked the pages down.
[02:14:49.784 --> 02:14:50.565]  They don't tell me what I did.
[02:14:50.565 --> 02:14:54.646]  They just say I'm dangerous and then talk about anti-Semitism.
[02:14:54.646 --> 02:14:55.906]  So this is what's going on.
[02:14:55.906 --> 02:15:02.408]  They also warned us they may ban the pages this week because we said the measles outbreak is coming from illegal aliens and showed an ABC News report.
[02:15:03.092 --> 02:15:04.354]  Maybe we can document cam shot that.
[02:15:04.354 --> 02:15:06.437]  So I'm not going to get to this till next hour.
[02:15:06.437 --> 02:15:08.760]  I want to talk to Leanne.
[02:15:08.760 --> 02:15:09.361]  I want to take a...
[02:15:10.418 --> 02:15:11.258]  You know, phone calls.
[02:15:11.258 --> 02:15:12.699]  We're going to go into the fourth hour.
[02:15:12.699 --> 02:15:14.180]  Leanne, it's so good to have her here.
[02:15:14.180 --> 02:15:15.000]  We'll get into this.
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:20.102]  But they already have a shadow band on these pages, so it doesn't really even matter.
[02:15:20.102 --> 02:15:23.564]  People can go to those pages themselves and see materials, so it has some effect.
[02:15:23.564 --> 02:15:28.726]  But, you know, it's kind of like having a fire hose and then dialing it back to a pixie straw.
[02:15:28.726 --> 02:15:33.328]  That's why you've got to point out to folks, Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[02:15:33.328 --> 02:15:34.268]  That's how you find us.
[02:15:34.268 --> 02:15:37.109]  And they're trying to take our servers away there and shut us down.
[02:15:37.109 --> 02:15:37.830]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:15:38.750 --> 02:15:41.955]  The beautiful Rip Van Winkle is here.
[02:15:41.955 --> 02:15:45.320]  We'll explain how she's Rip Van Winkle when we come back.
[02:15:45.320 --> 02:15:46.782]  Sweet Leanne McAdoo.
[02:15:46.782 --> 02:15:48.404]  Smart Leanne McAdoo.
[02:15:48.404 --> 02:15:50.988]  When we come back, she has returned.
[02:15:50.988 --> 02:15:52.470]  The prodigal daughter.
[02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:53.211]  We'll be right back.
[02:15:53.211 --> 02:15:53.671]  Stay with us.

[02:17:00.467 --> 02:17:05.828]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the Alt-Left Sanctuary State until one day I chose to leave my family to freedom.
[02:17:05.828 --> 02:17:13.870]  Today we live on a sustainable 20-acre homestead where we shoot, hunt, garden, and homeschool our children without the tyranny of the nanny state looking over us.

[02:17:24.597 --> 02:17:30.940]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:17:30.940 --> 02:17:33.981]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:17:33.981 --> 02:17:39.923]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:17:39.923 --> 02:17:43.705]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:17:43.705 --> 02:17:44.965]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:17:44.965 --> 02:17:46.306]  Who do we fight for?
[02:17:46.306 --> 02:17:52.508]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:17:52.508 --> 02:17:53.949]  Available at Amazon Books.
[02:17:56.488 --> 02:18:01.330]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[02:18:01.330 --> 02:18:10.254]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[02:18:10.254 --> 02:18:15.616]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.
[02:18:15.616 --> 02:18:23.839]  A new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects
[02:18:23.979 --> 02:18:24.279]  I think so.

[02:19:00.427 --> 02:19:01.628]  Focus.
[02:19:01.628 --> 02:19:02.589]  Clarity.

[02:20:21.741 --> 02:20:23.403]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:20:23.403 --> 02:20:25.766]  Well, so does LeAnn McAdoo.
[02:20:25.766 --> 02:20:27.487]  You want to stop tyranny?

[02:20:29.149 --> 02:20:34.595]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:34.595 --> 02:20:37.378]  Well, the deep state is striking back, striking back big time.
[02:20:37.378 --> 02:20:39.220]  I'm going to reserve comment until the next hour.
[02:20:40.436 --> 02:20:47.141]  But they say I've been banned for being dangerous and anti-semitic from Facebook, then I will quote be purged!
[02:20:47.141 --> 02:20:49.183]  PURGED!
[02:20:49.183 --> 02:20:51.725]  There's one thing to take me off your platform.
[02:20:51.725 --> 02:20:56.389]  There's another thing to make crap up, and then the deplatforming is this defamation.
[02:20:58.095 --> 02:21:01.477]  So we're going to get into all the calls with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:21:01.477 --> 02:21:03.457]  She's going to host with us in the next hour.
[02:21:03.457 --> 02:21:06.259]  Leanne, it is so good to see you.
[02:21:06.259 --> 02:21:08.980]  And I guess you started working here like nine years ago.
[02:21:08.980 --> 02:21:11.921]  You've been gone taking care of your grandma about a year and a half ago.
[02:21:11.921 --> 02:21:13.462]  You took some other time off.
[02:21:13.462 --> 02:21:17.384]  I want to know, Ponce de Leon, he was looking for the Fountain of Youth in Florida.
[02:21:17.384 --> 02:21:23.807]  I know you live in Florida part of the time, but you have found the Fountain of Youth because you look almost as young as when I first met you.
[02:21:23.807 --> 02:21:25.807]  Like dial back six, seven, eight years.
[02:21:25.807 --> 02:21:26.548]  What's happening here?
[02:21:27.318 --> 02:21:28.080]  Yeah.
[02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:28.701]  You know what?
[02:21:28.701 --> 02:21:35.955]  This is what shutting off social media and the news and all the cacophony of voices out there will do to you.
[02:21:35.955 --> 02:21:37.658]  Gives you your life back, your energy.
[02:21:40.106 --> 02:21:41.848]  You know, it was a really tough year last year, 2018.
[02:21:41.848 --> 02:21:45.492]  So, a lot of personal things going on.
[02:21:45.492 --> 02:21:48.475]  And I just took a mental health break.
[02:21:48.475 --> 02:21:51.418]  And like, turning off social media was a huge part of that.
[02:21:51.418 --> 02:22:01.008]  And just being, taking forest bathing to a whole new degree with just living out in the woods in Topanga, climbing the mountains, going up in caves.
[02:22:01.969 --> 02:22:03.630]  You know, needed four-wheel drive.
[02:22:03.630 --> 02:22:05.411]  I like this!
[02:22:05.411 --> 02:22:06.812]  What is this website?
[02:22:06.812 --> 02:22:10.555]  Oh, that's just... it hasn't been updated, but that's lianmackadoo.com.
[02:22:10.555 --> 02:22:11.435]  You want to follow me there?
[02:22:11.435 --> 02:22:13.957]  And, you know, we're married, supposedly.
[02:22:13.957 --> 02:22:14.217]  Right.
[02:22:14.217 --> 02:22:14.938]  We have a long relationship.
[02:22:14.938 --> 02:22:19.801]  Apparently, I've been pregnant for, like, eight years.
[02:22:19.801 --> 02:22:25.145]  You know, you're friends with my wife and all the rest of it, but I tell you, we're not... I'm not that exciting, you know.
[02:22:25.145 --> 02:22:31.028]  Yeah, the rumors are much more scandalous than life actually is.
[02:22:32.099 --> 02:22:34.660]  It's incredible to see how swiftly they brought the hammer down and shut everything down.
[02:22:50.183 --> 02:23:19.382]  You know, you could have gone on for 20, 30 more years and done your show, they wouldn't have cared, they wouldn't have touched you, but the fact that InfoWars played such a pivotal role in the 2016 election, and they started to really go, wow, okay, they're dangerous because they're actually turning on people's minds and giving them different information than the media has been able to control all the information streams all of these years, and of course with the internet,
[02:23:20.731 --> 02:23:29.516]  Too many people waking up too fast to the fact that they are being programmed and propaganda onslaught from the mainstream media sources.
[02:23:29.516 --> 02:23:35.339]  So of course, before this next big election coming up, they've got to shut down all those voices that
[02:23:35.959 --> 02:23:37.861]  That cost them the election in 2016.
[02:23:37.861 --> 02:23:42.084]  And I love how they'll go to Congress and say, we've never censored anybody or anything.
[02:23:42.084 --> 02:23:45.948]  And then they'll just systematically go, we're going to ban everybody that got Trump elected.
[02:23:45.948 --> 02:23:48.590]  And then they lie why they ban you when they do it.
[02:23:48.590 --> 02:23:49.551]  That's the defamation.
[02:23:49.551 --> 02:23:52.994]  Like, OK, Facebook, you're going to ban me.
[02:23:52.994 --> 02:23:56.197]  Why do you say dangerous and anti-Semitic?
[02:23:56.197 --> 02:23:57.698]  You know, it's not true.
[02:23:57.698 --> 02:24:00.441]  You're just lying jerks, man.
[02:24:00.441 --> 02:24:02.302]  I can say, you know, just being
[02:24:03.143 --> 02:24:03.223]  Yeah.
[02:24:20.854 --> 02:24:22.735]  Social score.
[02:24:22.735 --> 02:24:33.063]  They make it to where now your friends or your true fans, they're embarrassed to say that they follow you or this or that because, oh now I'm going to be associated with this anti-Semite or whatever.
[02:24:33.063 --> 02:24:35.865]  Even if it's not true, but now that you've been labeled as that.
[02:24:35.865 --> 02:24:39.668]  They give in to the peer pressure and then now it gives the bullies more power.
[02:24:39.668 --> 02:24:40.588]  Exactly.
[02:24:40.588 --> 02:24:42.210]  And that's what it is.
[02:24:42.210 --> 02:24:44.531]  There's almost a timidity with people where they're
[02:24:45.532 --> 02:24:54.256]  Like, oh yeah, I love Alex, you know, I watch it, you know, because it's like they're seeing this tyranny kind of come down and cut people's channels off.
[02:24:54.256 --> 02:24:59.319]  And I know mainstream media lies, but literally most people I talk to go, I used to love you when you were on air, I wish you were still on air.
[02:24:59.319 --> 02:25:01.160]  And I'm like, you know the media lies.
[02:25:01.160 --> 02:25:03.141]  In a way, our show's gotten bigger.
[02:25:03.141 --> 02:25:04.321]  We have video and our own audio.
[02:25:04.321 --> 02:25:05.282]  You do?
[02:25:05.282 --> 02:25:06.162]  Yeah.
[02:25:06.162 --> 02:25:09.944]  Oh, I know your site's there, but it's like the media said, he's gone.
[02:25:09.944 --> 02:25:12.325]  And they go, he is gone, he is gone.
[02:25:13.999 --> 02:25:18.803]  It's just, again, they could have gotten rid of these other pages a long time ago.
[02:25:18.803 --> 02:25:21.244]  They chose to, like, dole this out.
[02:25:21.244 --> 02:25:29.871]  Right, so it keeps it in the news cycle, how you're bad, and then they can wrap you up with whoever the new bad guy is, Louis Farrakhan.
[02:25:29.871 --> 02:25:31.172]  Well, let me say this about Louis Farrakhan.
[02:25:32.552 --> 02:25:34.753]  Obviously, he's a big interviewer.
[02:25:34.753 --> 02:25:40.797]  He says a lot of things I think make sense, like black communities shouldn't be dependent, they should have their own businesses, all that's great.
[02:25:40.797 --> 02:25:41.737]  He says some things I disagree with.
[02:25:41.737 --> 02:25:44.379]  I went and did a famous interview, so did 60 Minutes.
[02:25:44.379 --> 02:25:49.021]  And he had dinner with me and wanted to know, I want to stop the race war, I want to figure out a way to work with Trump to bring people together.
[02:25:49.021 --> 02:25:51.483]  But he goes, I don't know if my constituents are going to get that.
[02:25:51.483 --> 02:25:56.846]  He's tried to stop and like, you know, in your old age, kind of transcend things.
[02:25:57.506 --> 02:25:59.127]  The media gave it zero coverage.
[02:25:59.127 --> 02:26:06.112]  There's Louis Farrakhan saying, I want whites and blacks and everybody else to come together, and Jews and Christians and Muslims, and it got no coverage.
[02:26:06.112 --> 02:26:11.075]  Well, it also got no coverage when President Obama was there eating dinner with them.
[02:26:11.075 --> 02:26:12.336]  You know, that got no coverage.
[02:26:12.336 --> 02:26:18.400]  They kept that picture from making the rounds on social media until well after he was out of office.
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:20.841]  Or the women's march.
[02:26:23.377 --> 02:26:27.860]  Linda Sarsour and these others, who they just put up on this pedestal and everyone's like, well, wait a minute.
[02:26:27.860 --> 02:26:28.661]  No, I agree.
[02:26:28.661 --> 02:26:32.344]  I think David Duke, Louis Farrakhan, I mean, I'll say it.
[02:26:32.344 --> 02:26:33.425]  I've interviewed David Duke.
[02:26:33.425 --> 02:26:34.025]  I've talked to him.
[02:26:34.025 --> 02:26:35.947]  He's like a robot.
[02:26:35.947 --> 02:26:39.550]  Farrakhan has a lot of charm, and I think deep down means well.
[02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:42.593]  And, you know, back when he started all this stuff, people were oppressing black folks.
[02:26:42.593 --> 02:26:44.474]  They had to have their own identity to stand up.
[02:26:44.474 --> 02:26:46.136]  And I think now he gets that.
[02:26:46.136 --> 02:26:47.477]  He's being played now.
[02:26:47.477 --> 02:26:49.338]  With Duke, he's just playing the whole game.
[02:26:50.399 --> 02:26:51.420]  Right.
[02:26:51.420 --> 02:26:55.442]  Yeah, and obviously I don't agree with a lot of what these people say.
[02:26:55.442 --> 02:26:57.023]  But they have a right to a platform.
[02:26:57.023 --> 02:26:57.804]  Exactly.
[02:26:57.804 --> 02:26:58.364]  And that's it.
[02:26:58.364 --> 02:27:05.288]  It's like I did see on Twitter that the big scandal was that Venezuela took CNN off the air.
[02:27:05.288 --> 02:27:06.149]  And that's terrible.
[02:27:06.149 --> 02:27:09.771]  That's bad because the dictator is taking CNN off the air.
[02:27:09.771 --> 02:27:19.617]  But then meanwhile, we've got like Oliver Darcy and others celebrating other people here in a country where we actually have free speech as part of our constitution.
[02:27:20.377 --> 02:27:22.658]  The right to free speech, free press.
[02:27:22.658 --> 02:27:24.899]  They're celebrating that being taken down.
[02:27:24.899 --> 02:27:27.600]  It's just like, it is clown world.
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:30.422]  I'm already feeling crazy again.
[02:27:30.422 --> 02:27:36.244]  I wanted to make this interview about you, and how much we miss you, and how awesome you are.
[02:27:36.244 --> 02:27:38.765]  And to take calls, and instead it's gonzo journalism.
[02:27:38.765 --> 02:27:40.926]  We're back in the news, under attack again.
[02:27:40.926 --> 02:27:43.687]  And by the way folks, I'm not a victim, I'm a target, like Tommy Robinson says.
[02:27:43.687 --> 02:27:44.428]  But let me explain something.
[02:27:45.648 --> 02:27:50.151]  For everything you see on the surface, and Leigh-Anne can attest to this, there's a lot going on behind the scenes.
[02:27:50.151 --> 02:27:52.513]  They've played some dirty tricks on you, too.
[02:27:52.513 --> 02:28:02.459]  Yeah, well that's why I just... You know, when Matt Drudge came here years ago and said to get out of these internet ghettos and to shut it down... I wish I'd have listened to him more then.
[02:28:02.459 --> 02:28:03.160]  I mean, I tried.
[02:28:04.209 --> 02:28:06.110]  Yeah, well, I did.
[02:28:06.110 --> 02:28:12.832]  I mean, I've really... Well, they admit it manipulates your dopamine, social media is meant to make you depressed, and you say you're so happy now that you're out of it.
[02:28:12.832 --> 02:28:20.035]  Yeah, and I can't delete my accounts and everything because I've got to keep a record with this lawsuit that I'm involved in.
[02:28:20.035 --> 02:28:21.275]  You know, I can't delete.
[02:28:21.275 --> 02:28:28.958]  That's right, you got sued by the Vatican, by Georgetown University that's funding it, lying and saying you said that some dude killed a woman.
[02:28:28.958 --> 02:28:29.759]  You never said that.
[02:28:29.759 --> 02:28:30.659]  No, I nodded.
[02:28:30.659 --> 02:28:32.900]  I'm named in the lawsuit because I went.
[02:28:34.958 --> 02:28:37.719]  Which is, you know, what you do when you're looking into the camera.
[02:28:37.719 --> 02:28:39.440]  Just terrorizing people.
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:43.282]  Yeah, it's just silencing any dissenting voices.
[02:28:43.282 --> 02:28:45.223]  So, anyone who might make an impact.
[02:28:45.223 --> 02:28:49.025]  You're awesome, and we're going to come back and take phone calls and get into a bunch of issues.
[02:28:49.025 --> 02:28:50.086]  And it's so good to have you here.
[02:28:50.086 --> 02:28:52.307]  It's just, it's good.
[02:28:52.307 --> 02:28:54.668]  I mean, hell, we're here like seven, eight years, man.
[02:28:55.308 --> 02:29:00.292]  Number one international best-selling author, Matthew David Hurtado's pain was simple.
[02:29:00.292 --> 02:29:08.499]  Lyme disease bankrupt him in 2009, watching bankers take everything from his family after building a seven-figure business from his couch.
[02:29:08.499 --> 02:29:14.444]  God called him to ministry to teach prosperity based on pain he could not tolerate in others' lives.
[02:29:14.844 --> 02:29:15.545]  We're good to go.
[02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:35.781]  It's all consciousness.

[02:30:16.650 --> 02:30:20.112]  Absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[02:30:20.112 --> 02:30:22.194]  It is a classical 360 win.
[02:30:22.194 --> 02:30:31.900]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.

[02:30:56.313 --> 02:30:59.374]  Our grandparents and great-grandparents knew that they canned food.
[02:30:59.374 --> 02:31:02.315]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.
[02:31:02.315 --> 02:31:05.276]  And that's what I'm talking about at InfoWarsTour.com.

[02:32:51.937 --> 02:32:52.377]  God bless you.
[02:32:58.746 --> 02:33:01.350]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:17.111 --> 02:33:23.075]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:23.075 --> 02:33:26.597]  All right, I want to go to Tracy and all these other callers that have been holding with Leanne McAdoo.
[02:33:26.597 --> 02:33:28.018]  She's going to host me into the next hour.
[02:33:28.018 --> 02:33:29.939]  She's back in the studio with us.
[02:33:29.939 --> 02:33:32.020]  And she took off about a year to take care of her grandmother who was sick.
[02:33:32.020 --> 02:33:35.062]  And then she just took off some more time, which I think is great.
[02:33:35.062 --> 02:33:37.023]  And then she called up last week and said, hey, I'm coming to town.
[02:33:37.023 --> 02:33:37.724]  I'm going to come on the show.
[02:33:37.724 --> 02:33:38.164]  And she's here.
[02:33:39.022 --> 02:33:43.664]  So, boy, it's awesome to have her here.
[02:33:43.664 --> 02:33:50.568]  Next hour, I'll get into being banned with Louis Farrakhan and Milo Yiannopoulos for being, quote, dangerous.
[02:33:50.568 --> 02:33:51.488]  They don't even say why.
[02:33:51.488 --> 02:33:54.910]  They just say, well, he's anti-Semitic like Louis Farrakhan.
[02:33:54.910 --> 02:33:59.232]  I mean, even if that guy's criticized people, I think he has a right to free speech.
[02:33:59.232 --> 02:34:02.053]  But regardless, this mixing me in with him is crazy.
[02:34:02.053 --> 02:34:02.854]  We'll get to that next hour.
[02:34:03.482 --> 02:34:04.243]  Yeah.
[02:34:04.243 --> 02:34:21.234]  And that's all by design, of course, so that no matter what you say, or it can be discredited, and if anyone wants to talk about you or share your information on their social media accounts that still exist, they can be ostracized from their community, too, just like Communist China.
[02:34:21.234 --> 02:34:24.236]  It's almost like the social media giants are
[02:34:25.197 --> 02:34:30.739]  Shifting their rules in terms of service so that they can do business in these communist countries.
[02:34:30.739 --> 02:34:32.479]  Oh no, they admit that's the official plan.
[02:34:32.479 --> 02:34:32.899]  Right.
[02:34:32.899 --> 02:34:38.721]  So they've got to shut down any dissenting voices, anyone that... For a global system of no free speech except for authoritarians.
[02:34:38.721 --> 02:34:39.701]  And people have to fight back.
[02:34:39.701 --> 02:34:42.802]  That's why Drudge came here, like you said, three years ago and said, you must
[02:34:43.642 --> 02:34:45.883]  Do everything at Infowars.com and Newswars.
[02:34:45.883 --> 02:34:46.824]  You must have your own audio.
[02:34:46.824 --> 02:34:48.104]  You must have your own video.
[02:34:48.104 --> 02:34:49.185]  We already had most of that.
[02:34:49.185 --> 02:34:52.086]  Now we do, but people then still think we're not on air.
[02:34:52.086 --> 02:34:52.327]  Right.
[02:34:52.327 --> 02:34:55.388]  They think radio and TV doesn't exist now.
[02:34:55.388 --> 02:34:57.129]  They think it's only Facebook.
[02:34:57.129 --> 02:34:58.069]  It's only YouTube.
[02:34:58.069 --> 02:34:58.910]  It's only Twitter.
[02:34:58.910 --> 02:35:01.531]  That's the only place I can get my information from.
[02:35:01.531 --> 02:35:03.412]  And then we wonder why everyone is crazy.
[02:35:03.412 --> 02:35:12.657]  I think there was a report out on Drudge the other day that talked about how regardless that the economy is doing good and people are in a better place and everyone is still
[02:35:13.498 --> 02:35:15.121]  Mentally ill.
[02:35:15.121 --> 02:35:20.754]  People are angry, they're upset and they can't accept that things are okay.
[02:35:20.754 --> 02:35:22.679]  Have you seen how deranged the left's getting?
[02:35:24.506 --> 02:35:28.727]  Here's the thing, because a lot of my friends are on the left.
[02:35:28.727 --> 02:35:30.348]  They're progressives.
[02:35:30.348 --> 02:35:32.529]  That's why I'm always kind of torn.
[02:35:32.529 --> 02:35:33.889]  Well, you're a libertarian yourself!
[02:35:33.889 --> 02:35:37.510]  These are real human beings that I love and know.
[02:35:37.510 --> 02:35:42.292]  I just got in a big argument with a good friend of mine because she said,
[02:35:44.012 --> 02:35:47.873]  Trump, they brought the Mueller report out and he's guilty colluding with the Russians.
[02:35:47.873 --> 02:35:52.595]  And I'm like, no, that's absolutely not what that report said.
[02:35:52.595 --> 02:35:53.275]  Yes, it is.
[02:35:53.275 --> 02:35:55.956]  It said this and there's collusion and obstruction.
[02:35:55.956 --> 02:35:59.637]  And I'm just like, no, that that is not true.
[02:35:59.637 --> 02:36:00.777]  What are you talking about?
[02:36:00.777 --> 02:36:01.557]  It actually.
[02:36:01.557 --> 02:36:02.938]  And then she's like, well, did you read it?
[02:36:02.938 --> 02:36:03.658]  Did you read it?
[02:36:03.658 --> 02:36:05.218]  Well, I don't want to.
[02:36:05.218 --> 02:36:08.539]  I don't want to hear anyone's opinion about it until they've read the report themselves.
[02:36:08.539 --> 02:36:09.880]  And I'm like, well, did you read it?
[02:36:09.880 --> 02:36:09.920]  No.
[02:36:11.360 --> 02:36:21.043]  Okay, well then why are you coming so strongly, like, attached to this ideology that the Mueller report said that Trump colluded with the Russians?
[02:36:21.043 --> 02:36:27.425]  Like, it's just, we are dealing with people who have their minds set that these are the facts.
[02:36:27.425 --> 02:36:34.747]  They've turned their will over to it, because... Yeah, it's just... You've been here, you've been screamed, you're a Russian agent, you've seen what's happened to us.
[02:36:34.747 --> 02:36:38.548]  I mean, there's no Russians here telling us what to do, there's no Russian funding, it's our audience funding us.
[02:36:38.968 --> 02:36:39.428]  Right.
[02:36:39.428 --> 02:36:41.009]  Did anybody ever tell you what to do here?
[02:36:41.009 --> 02:36:42.489]  No.
[02:36:42.489 --> 02:36:54.952]  No, and that's the thing that's just... That's why I had to take a step back, because I just, I realize that we're arguing up against a brick wall, and it's almost as if our realities are superimposed.
[02:36:54.952 --> 02:37:03.715]  And so you have the left living in this reality, the right living in this reality, and everyone's just yelling at each other, and they believe that their version of reality is true.
[02:37:04.215 --> 02:37:04.755]  The truth.
[02:37:04.755 --> 02:37:06.096]  And we're not coming together.
[02:37:22.441 --> 02:37:24.942]  Well, I think it's kind of in their face as well.
[02:37:24.942 --> 02:37:35.527]  A lot of people are kind of waking up to the fact that the governor of Virginia, for some reason, is still the governor of Virginia, even though he was caught in KKK robes and blackface.
[02:37:35.527 --> 02:37:39.729]  There's a total double standard, and that was the thing that I, you know, what really
[02:37:46.682 --> 02:38:02.664]  That was the only truth that I could find inside of my heart was that I needed to take a step back and get back in touch with my own intuition and really strengthen my discernment because there's just so much misinformation out there right now and disinformation, you know, by design lying to people.
[02:38:02.844 --> 02:38:03.224]  No, I agree.
[02:38:03.224 --> 02:38:07.547]  I want to go to Tracy and these calls, and you'll have the floor next hour, and you're awesome for being here.
[02:38:07.547 --> 02:38:10.329]  But I want to ask you, give you a real summation, because you called, wanted to come in.
[02:38:10.329 --> 02:38:12.311]  I've been asking you to come in or come on for a year.
[02:38:12.311 --> 02:38:13.471]  You said, listen, I'm unplugged.
[02:38:13.471 --> 02:38:14.752]  I'm having to figure this out.
[02:38:14.752 --> 02:38:16.494]  What would you define InfoWars?
[02:38:16.494 --> 02:38:21.177]  Because everybody knows you're a good, smart person, a very pure person, you know, when it comes to your view of things.
[02:38:21.177 --> 02:38:24.019]  You're not taking other people's brainwashing in.
[02:38:24.019 --> 02:38:25.540]  How would you define InfoWars?
[02:38:25.540 --> 02:38:27.821]  Because, you know, they project all these lies on us.
[02:38:27.821 --> 02:38:29.683]  They claim all this stuff's going on here that doesn't happen.
[02:38:30.236 --> 02:38:32.378]  Well, I mean, it is the tip of the spear.
[02:38:32.378 --> 02:38:43.785]  And if people could go back into our archives, which, you know, now we're going to have to upload everything, but they would see all of the information that's there that they don't want you to have access to.
[02:38:43.785 --> 02:38:47.348]  We really have been fighting against these dead on.
[02:38:47.348 --> 02:38:58.496]  And the fact that you were talking about 5G and the Internet and how they were going to start controlling what people are able to access information and taking you off the Internet if you
[02:38:58.996 --> 02:38:59.636]  Ten years ago.
[02:38:59.636 --> 02:39:00.797]  Don't play the game.
[02:39:00.797 --> 02:39:02.918]  And people were like, oh, he's just a crazy guy.
[02:39:02.918 --> 02:39:09.001]  And now it's, it's like almost just a weird irony that they did it to you first.
[02:39:09.001 --> 02:39:16.104]  But don't they, don't the establishment get, or the public even get, that they're banning us because they're so afraid of what we're doing.
[02:39:16.104 --> 02:39:17.945]  And now they went, oh, we banned him before it didn't work.
[02:39:17.945 --> 02:39:20.326]  Now let's tie him to Farrakhan.
[02:39:20.326 --> 02:39:21.907]  And I'm not even attacking Farrakhan.
[02:39:21.907 --> 02:39:25.969]  I'm not going to take the cheap trick of like saying, oh, Farrakhan, I'm out with Farrakhan.
[02:39:25.969 --> 02:39:28.110]  The point is, is that they just did this now as a cheap trick.
[02:39:28.669 --> 02:39:29.309]  Right.
[02:39:29.309 --> 02:39:29.769]  And it is.
[02:39:29.769 --> 02:39:31.650]  It's all social programming.
[02:39:31.650 --> 02:39:42.675]  It's all programming so that people will be ashamed, embarrassed, or whatever, to associate with InfoWars because CNN said it was, you know, anti-Semitic.
[02:39:42.675 --> 02:39:43.075]  It's just like...
[02:39:43.955 --> 02:39:50.580]  People don't understand how much they're being conditioned and programmed and that's why you gotta step back.
[02:39:50.580 --> 02:39:53.783]  Racist takes away from real racists that are out there and creates racism.
[02:39:53.783 --> 02:39:59.107]  I want to take some calls, I said I would, but I want to get more into this and your time forest bathing and everything because I want to go do that too.
[02:39:59.107 --> 02:39:59.747]  Everybody should do it.
[02:39:59.747 --> 02:40:04.031]  Study show an hour a day outside literally makes you way more healthy and happy.
[02:40:04.031 --> 02:40:06.332]  Tracy, you held over 40 minutes to 30 minutes.
[02:40:06.332 --> 02:40:06.933]  I appreciate you.
[02:40:07.573 --> 02:40:15.619]  People that didn't hear what you had to say 30 minutes ago, 40 minutes ago, you broke it down saying, Obama gave the orders for the illegal spying.
[02:40:15.619 --> 02:40:18.382]  That's the ace in the hole, the Democrats, why Hillary's so arrogant.
[02:40:18.382 --> 02:40:24.726]  Because if then it leads back to Obama, you can't indict him because he's a former president and he's black.
[02:40:24.726 --> 02:40:28.069]  That's why they're pushing the race war narrative and everything went bing, bing, bing.
[02:40:28.069 --> 02:40:30.090]  A big old light bulb went off over my head.
[02:40:30.090 --> 02:40:31.712]  So what other knowledge you want to dump on us?
[02:40:36.383 --> 02:40:39.205]  How you doing Miss Leanne?
[02:40:39.205 --> 02:40:41.326]  Hello there!
[02:40:41.326 --> 02:40:45.830]  One thing about it is, what you mention all the time, is the Zeitgeist.
[02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:49.572]  They have one too, but theirs is of their father.
[02:40:49.572 --> 02:40:50.353]  You know what I mean?
[02:40:50.353 --> 02:40:54.115]  And right now, he feels the fire on his behind.
[02:40:54.115 --> 02:40:56.437]  So he has to... Dougherty, you're a little bit overdriven.
[02:40:56.437 --> 02:40:57.197]  Tracy, you're awesome.
[02:40:57.197 --> 02:40:58.378]  Back off your phone just a little bit.
[02:40:58.378 --> 02:40:59.559]  You're just like me, you're talking loud.
[02:40:59.559 --> 02:41:00.840]  Back up a little bit.
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:01.720]  Is this a little better?
[02:41:01.720 --> 02:41:02.021]  Yes.
[02:41:02.021 --> 02:41:02.381]  That's better.
[02:41:02.381 --> 02:41:02.921]  Go ahead, start over.
[02:41:02.921 --> 02:41:03.662]  You're talking about Zeitgeist.
[02:41:04.864 --> 02:41:10.797]  Um, basically what I was saying is, you touch on this just about daily about the zeitgeist.
[02:41:10.797 --> 02:41:13.523]  Um, what we have to realize is that the enemy is zeitgeist.
[02:41:14.176 --> 02:41:15.057]  It's just like ours.
[02:41:15.057 --> 02:41:26.887]  It's just as powerful even though we have the side of good and they feel as though everything right now is speeding up because what you have to realize is their zeitgeist wasn't awakened until Trump was elected.
[02:41:26.887 --> 02:41:31.211]  So for them, everything was all good until Trump was elected.
[02:41:31.211 --> 02:41:36.895]  This is why they're going so crazy so fast because right now their world is deteriorating too.
[02:41:36.895 --> 02:41:38.417]  Their life is deteriorating.
[02:41:40.433 --> 02:41:42.976]  We did this for five other callers, and I haven't started the podcast yet.
[02:41:42.976 --> 02:41:43.817]  I'm two years behind.
[02:41:43.817 --> 02:41:51.366]  Get this guy's name, or get his number, Tracy's number, and if only get him on as a guest, because everything Tracy's saying is crystallizing.
[02:41:51.366 --> 02:41:52.247]  That's exactly right.
[02:41:52.247 --> 02:41:53.308]  We have a site, guys.
[02:41:53.308 --> 02:41:56.933]  We have a digital cellular network, Sixth Sense.
[02:41:56.933 --> 02:41:57.854]  The enemy has one.
[02:41:58.535 --> 02:42:02.180]  And their broadcasting system is saying, shut Jones down.
[02:42:02.180 --> 02:42:03.081]  Shut Jones down.
[02:42:03.081 --> 02:42:04.403]  I'm not trying to act powerful.
[02:42:04.403 --> 02:42:06.545]  My God, though, they're obsessed with it.
[02:42:06.545 --> 02:42:08.088]  What do you think, looking into their zeitgeist?
[02:42:08.088 --> 02:42:09.249]  I'm going to come back to you.
[02:42:09.249 --> 02:42:10.611]  You've got to finish up here, Tracy.
[02:42:10.611 --> 02:42:13.174]  But right now, why do you think in their zeitgeist they want to get us?
[02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:19.152]  Um, because in all honesty, we're the only thing that stops them from the one world government.
[02:42:19.152 --> 02:42:25.276]  Our Zeitgeists, not necessarily Christians, but anybody who doesn't want to live under anybody.
[02:42:25.276 --> 02:42:27.797]  And that's the number one thing that they want.
[02:42:27.797 --> 02:42:30.178]  They want us to live up under them.
[02:42:30.178 --> 02:42:31.599]  They want serfs, not citizens.
[02:42:31.599 --> 02:42:32.140]  No, that's it.
[02:42:32.140 --> 02:42:34.181]  Anybody that has a spirit and not want to be a slave.
[02:42:34.181 --> 02:42:34.361]  Right.
[02:42:35.259 --> 02:42:36.660]  The anti-slavery Zeitgeist.
[02:42:36.660 --> 02:42:38.040]  We're going to come right back and finish up with Tracy.
[02:42:38.040 --> 02:42:39.281]  He's on fire.
[02:42:39.281 --> 02:42:40.422]  And I promise we'll go to all their callers.
[02:42:40.422 --> 02:42:41.822]  Leanne McAdoo is here with us.
[02:42:41.822 --> 02:42:43.783]  This is awesome to have Leanne back.
[02:42:43.783 --> 02:42:46.585]  I don't even care if I'm getting banned on Facebook even more because Leanne's here.
[02:42:46.585 --> 02:42:49.006]  It's like a member of the family here.
[02:42:49.006 --> 02:42:50.967]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:50.967 --> 02:42:51.307]  Stay with us.

[02:45:05.580 --> 02:45:14.604]  By leaps and by bounds, the number one best-selling supplement family in the world is energy drinks and energy supplements.
[02:45:14.604 --> 02:45:24.667]  But they are riddled with dyes and toxins and synthetic caffeines and other chemicals that sure get you a quick boost, but burn out in just a few hours and have terrible side effects.
[02:45:24.667 --> 02:45:33.211]  We have developed, hands down from our research, the most powerful, healthy energy drink, pre-workout and beyond system in the world.
[02:45:34.031 --> 02:45:35.391]  There's nothing else like it.
[02:45:35.391 --> 02:45:36.532]  You must experience it.
[02:45:36.532 --> 02:45:38.492]  It is a total game changer.
[02:45:38.492 --> 02:45:43.533]  And it comes in easy to use packets to mix in with fruit juice or water, whatever you'd like.
[02:45:43.533 --> 02:45:45.074]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[02:45:45.074 --> 02:45:46.534]  It lasts up to 10 hours.
[02:45:46.534 --> 02:45:53.236]  So take a half packet the first time you take it because Turbo Force is named Turbo Force because it will take you into overdrive.
[02:45:53.236 --> 02:45:54.716]  Turbo Force at MForceLife.com.
[02:45:57.216 --> 02:45:58.636]  I want to say brain force is great.
[02:45:58.636 --> 02:46:00.537]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[02:46:00.537 --> 02:46:01.157]  It is.
[02:46:01.157 --> 02:46:06.018]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[02:46:06.018 --> 02:46:07.378]  The fish oil is better than it.
[02:46:07.378 --> 02:46:09.198]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[02:46:09.198 --> 02:46:11.679]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[02:46:11.679 --> 02:46:14.759]  Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[02:46:14.759 --> 02:46:16.140]  You've got the children's.
[02:46:16.140 --> 02:46:17.260]  You've got the adults.
[02:46:17.260 --> 02:46:18.240]  You've got the krill oil.
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:21.641]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's are really strong.
[02:46:21.641 --> 02:46:23.541]  They don't give you the burpees, but krill oil is the
[02:46:23.541 --> 02:46:24.662]  We're good to go.
[02:46:47.489 --> 02:46:53.357]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[02:46:53.357 --> 02:46:59.786]  I just can't do it!
[02:46:59.786 --> 02:47:02.369]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.542 --> 02:47:21.624]  Well, Leigh-Anne's like Gandalf the Great.
[02:47:21.624 --> 02:47:23.867]  She was powerful before, but she came back even stronger.
[02:47:23.867 --> 02:47:24.708]  I can't wait next time.
[02:47:24.708 --> 02:47:25.849]  We're gonna do it all.
[02:47:25.849 --> 02:47:30.214]  I'll spend a couple segments, like six after, addressing the Facebook ban.
[02:47:30.214 --> 02:47:32.456]  Then I'm done with it.
[02:47:32.456 --> 02:47:33.417]  It's just par for the course.
[02:47:33.417 --> 02:47:34.318]  We're taking calls right now.
[02:47:34.318 --> 02:47:35.039]  I appreciate everybody holding.
[02:47:35.599 --> 02:47:40.524]  Tracy, you said some powerful stuff today, and I appreciate you holding so long to finish it.
[02:47:40.524 --> 02:47:46.871]  Say what you first said when you were on earlier, and then repeat that about the Zeitgeist, and then lay some more knowledge on us, because I'm not kissing your ass.
[02:47:46.871 --> 02:47:52.056]  Everything you're saying is why I'm taking these calls, because sometimes when I can't figure something out, I open the phones up.
[02:47:52.056 --> 02:47:55.419]  There's always one caller particularly that delivers the goods.
[02:47:55.419 --> 02:47:57.962]  You're doing it right now, Tracy, so give me the Zeitgeist.
[02:47:59.409 --> 02:48:05.091]  All right, so back to what I was saying earlier about how the whole Civil War is going to start.
[02:48:05.091 --> 02:48:08.712]  In all honesty, I feel like they've been gearing up for Trump's announcement.
[02:48:08.712 --> 02:48:20.095]  I actually believe that the insurance plan is them getting caught, because that insures our destruction, because we're going to revolt against that, if this makes sense.
[02:48:20.095 --> 02:48:21.796]  You say they're pushing us into revolt?
[02:48:22.998 --> 02:48:23.898]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:23.898 --> 02:48:28.820]  They're pushing us into revolt, which would ultimately lead to the economic collapse.
[02:48:28.820 --> 02:48:30.221]  It would lead to open borders.
[02:48:30.221 --> 02:48:35.103]  It would actually lead into everything they're trying to push for now.
[02:48:35.103 --> 02:48:39.705]  And that's why Trump's been so restrained, is he knows they're trapped.
[02:48:39.705 --> 02:48:40.405]  Yes, sir.
[02:48:40.405 --> 02:48:41.325]  Exactly.
[02:48:41.325 --> 02:48:44.767]  So, I truly believe that
[02:48:46.051 --> 02:48:51.374]  Like I was saying, with the Civil War, yeah, the indictment is really what's going to do it.
[02:48:51.374 --> 02:48:52.675]  Well, let me ask you this then.
[02:48:52.675 --> 02:48:53.555]  You're a smart guy.
[02:48:53.555 --> 02:48:57.157]  Who is Trump then in this panoptagon of characters?
[02:48:57.157 --> 02:48:59.559]  What do you think he's thinking right now?
[02:48:59.559 --> 02:49:02.340]  What's your view on Trump?
[02:49:02.340 --> 02:49:04.461]  In all honesty, I'm with you.
[02:49:04.461 --> 02:49:10.264]  There's a lot of things that I like, even though he's trying to uphold 5G, the vaccines and all of that.
[02:49:10.264 --> 02:49:12.826]  But in his mind right now, I truly believe
[02:49:13.593 --> 02:49:25.108]  He's just waiting for Barr to finish up so he can do the whole counterintelligence report that they've already got together the same day that they got the initial Mueller report.
[02:49:25.108 --> 02:49:26.750]  He's just waiting to drop that.
[02:49:26.750 --> 02:49:29.693]  Oh, let me tell you, he tries everything he says he's going to do.
[02:49:29.693 --> 02:49:31.616]  And let me tell you, he's coming after him.
[02:49:31.616 --> 02:49:32.317]  I mean, it's happening.
[02:49:32.697 --> 02:49:39.680]  And I guess the establishment doesn't want me on air telling their stay-behind networks that we're coming for you, but they won't get off our back.
[02:49:39.680 --> 02:49:45.823]  I don't want to hang their head on the wall for some pissing contest, but I mean, they're not stopping.
[02:49:45.823 --> 02:49:46.163]  Right.
[02:49:46.163 --> 02:49:50.825]  And what I truly believe is no one actually wants this.
[02:49:50.825 --> 02:49:54.006]  We have to talk about this in order to stop it.
[02:49:54.006 --> 02:49:55.287]  Mr. Knight says it best.
[02:49:55.287 --> 02:49:59.008]  The only way to stop bad speech is for free speech.
[02:49:59.008 --> 02:50:00.789]  And right now, all we hear is bad speech.
[02:50:01.765 --> 02:50:02.906]  You see what I'm saying?
[02:50:02.906 --> 02:50:03.727]  All right, no, I agree.
[02:50:03.727 --> 02:50:12.512]  And I want to start a show with the best callers we've got, where every week we do a show for three or four hours, where we have five or six callers with each other, and we have a moderator.
[02:50:12.512 --> 02:50:19.537]  So let's get your name and number, my friend, and get you on as a regular guest, because you brought up a lot of powerful points, and I appreciate callers holding while you laid that out.
[02:50:19.537 --> 02:50:24.920]  I mean, Leon, you can just feel, like you said during the break, there is an acceleration, there's a time of change, there's a time of choice happening.
[02:50:25.540 --> 02:50:39.792]  Absolutely, and that's kind of where we're at, is people who understand how energy works and who understand, you know, when we come together in groups, I mean it's in the Bible, two come together in my name, two or more, I'll be there.
[02:50:39.792 --> 02:50:42.435]  There's a spirit, there's an energy that is created
[02:50:42.935 --> 02:50:51.838]  When people come together and it's palpable if you're in a sports stadium and everyone's cheering on the other side, it's like there's an energy that's created.
[02:50:51.838 --> 02:51:00.120]  And so people in power or people out there playing chess, they understand how to take that energy and drive it in a certain way.
[02:51:00.640 --> 02:51:07.803]  Whereas people are genuinely upset with the state of affairs, but then someone is going, oh, you're very angry.
[02:51:07.803 --> 02:51:10.704]  Well, let me take that anger and I'm going to press you to this.
[02:51:10.704 --> 02:51:12.625]  Everybody has sixth sense.
[02:51:12.625 --> 02:51:14.746]  They just don't know how to read it.
[02:51:14.746 --> 02:51:16.627]  And so they tell you, you're upset.
[02:51:16.627 --> 02:51:18.308]  There's an enemy taking over.
[02:51:18.308 --> 02:51:19.648]  There's an evil power.
[02:51:19.648 --> 02:51:20.789]  It's the Russians.
[02:51:21.449 --> 02:51:23.190]  And people go, yeah, there is an evil.
[02:51:23.190 --> 02:51:24.670]  No, it's the globalists.
[02:51:24.670 --> 02:51:27.971]  I'm not even defending the Russians.
[02:51:27.971 --> 02:51:30.972]  They're a joke compared to the people running our country.
[02:51:30.972 --> 02:51:32.693]  And they're a joke compared to the Chinese.
[02:51:32.693 --> 02:51:34.374]  The Russians just want to run their own country.
[02:51:34.374 --> 02:51:36.274]  They're just old fashioned or whatever.
[02:51:36.274 --> 02:51:38.695]  They don't want power because they've already got power.
[02:51:38.695 --> 02:51:41.236]  They don't have needle dick syndrome is the issue.
[02:51:41.236 --> 02:51:42.876]  America didn't used to have that either.
[02:51:42.876 --> 02:51:47.138]  And so what's going on with the communist Chinese and these globalists is they want the power because they don't have it.
[02:51:47.698 --> 02:51:51.002]  And they are literally telling people, you feel that evil?
[02:51:51.002 --> 02:51:53.424]  Yeah, that's Trump and Alex Jones and the Russians.
[02:51:53.424 --> 02:51:55.206]  No, man, that's not the evil.
[02:51:55.206 --> 02:51:57.247]  People have to learn, like, yeah, you're feeling evil.
[02:51:57.247 --> 02:51:58.068]  It isn't us.
[02:51:58.068 --> 02:51:58.328]  Right.
[02:51:58.328 --> 02:51:59.349]  Well, that's it.
[02:51:59.349 --> 02:51:59.810]  You're right.
[02:51:59.810 --> 02:52:01.091]  We all do have a sixth sense.
[02:52:01.091 --> 02:52:03.794]  We all have that inner discernment and that inner knowing.
[02:52:03.794 --> 02:52:05.095]  It's our inner wisdom.
[02:52:05.095 --> 02:52:05.916]  It's our birthright.
[02:52:05.916 --> 02:52:06.857]  We're born with it.
[02:52:06.857 --> 02:52:09.739]  You know, we are connected to our God, right?
[02:52:11.260 --> 02:52:15.503]  The thing is, I think with the internet and everything, it almost raised that frequency.
[02:52:15.503 --> 02:52:24.507]  It pulled everyone's antenna up a little bit higher to where we were starting to say, wait a minute, I feel like what this news is giving me isn't the full story.
[02:52:24.507 --> 02:52:26.008]  I feel like this isn't the truth.
[02:52:26.008 --> 02:52:27.189]  Let me go get some information.
[02:52:27.189 --> 02:52:29.590]  Yeah, they thought it would enslave us, instead it triggered us.
[02:52:29.810 --> 02:52:40.675]  Right, and so now they're almost having to scramble the frequency, because we've raised our frequency a little bit to have a higher understanding, I mean, worldwide.
[02:52:40.675 --> 02:52:42.936]  And so now they're almost having to scramble that frequency.
[02:52:42.936 --> 02:52:43.737]  It's happening everywhere.
[02:52:43.737 --> 02:52:44.217]  Right.
[02:52:44.217 --> 02:52:47.098]  It's not even in just these little pockets anymore.
[02:52:47.098 --> 02:52:49.940]  I mean, we're getting to that hundredth monkey syndrome.
[02:52:49.940 --> 02:52:50.900]  And so they know that
[02:52:53.363 --> 02:52:54.964]  It's like, time is now.
[02:52:54.964 --> 02:53:03.591]  Like, this is the time to launch Operation Garden Plot or to, you know, get those frequencies just kind of really agitated so we can start civil war.
[02:53:03.591 --> 02:53:04.832]  It's the divide and conquer.
[02:53:04.832 --> 02:53:05.993]  We talk about this all the time.
[02:53:05.993 --> 02:53:07.894]  This is an epic time and now it's time for prayer.
[02:53:07.894 --> 02:53:13.158]  It's time for people that love, love, love decency and honor to come together and just be loving.
[02:53:13.158 --> 02:53:15.820]  It's time to reach out because I can make fun of the left all day and I do it.
[02:53:15.820 --> 02:53:17.821]  Then I realized I should be sad actually for these people.
[02:53:17.821 --> 02:53:18.742]  They're captured.
[02:53:18.962 --> 02:53:19.262]  Right.
[02:53:19.262 --> 02:53:23.224]  Well, and at the end of the day, we have to remember that these are real human beings.
[02:53:23.224 --> 02:53:26.486]  These are... Everyone's got something going on in their life.
[02:53:26.486 --> 02:53:27.046]  Nobody knows.
[02:53:27.046 --> 02:53:31.288]  Speaking of you, I know your grandmother had... You don't get your private stuff?
[02:53:31.288 --> 02:53:31.909]  Sure.
[02:53:31.909 --> 02:53:33.329]  She had a brain tumor and all that went through that.
[02:53:33.329 --> 02:53:35.951]  And then your mom got cancer and your dad died.
[02:53:35.951 --> 02:53:37.812]  You went through a lot the last few years.
[02:53:37.812 --> 02:53:38.372]  Last year.
[02:53:38.372 --> 02:53:44.535]  And the enemy turned it into, you know, I raped you or something is why you left.
[02:53:44.535 --> 02:53:45.976]  I mean, that's what the Internet does.
[02:53:45.976 --> 02:53:46.336]  It's sick.
[02:53:46.716 --> 02:53:54.820]  Right, yeah, that's, you know, that was the thing, that was another reason why I just shut it all down because everyone was creating all these... Like you said, when it rains, it pours.
[02:53:54.820 --> 02:53:55.761]  Yeah.
[02:53:55.761 --> 02:53:56.601]  Last year was hard.
[02:53:56.601 --> 02:54:02.864]  I mean, everybody here in the studio, we lost Joe Jennings and, you know, a few of my friends' mothers, you know.
[02:54:02.864 --> 02:54:03.605]  He was such a sweetheart, too.
[02:54:03.925 --> 02:54:04.886]  Yeah.
[02:54:04.886 --> 02:54:06.267]  It's just, it was a rough year.
[02:54:06.267 --> 02:54:07.607]  It was a very tough time.
[02:54:07.607 --> 02:54:13.912]  And a lot of people out there that want to come up with their own conspiracy theories about why I wasn't around.
[02:54:13.912 --> 02:54:19.575]  You know, it's just, people need to stop and like realize the energy that they're putting out in the world.
[02:54:19.575 --> 02:54:20.276]  It's evil.
[02:54:20.276 --> 02:54:24.899]  It's evil just to, just to make up that, you know, Alex Jones broke Leanne's jaw.
[02:54:24.899 --> 02:54:26.140]  That's why she's gone.
[02:54:26.140 --> 02:54:27.681]  We've never kissed each other.
[02:54:27.681 --> 02:54:28.962]  It's all a damn lie.
[02:54:28.962 --> 02:54:29.762]  Her dad died.
[02:54:29.762 --> 02:54:30.723]  Her mom had cancer.
[02:54:30.723 --> 02:54:31.363]  Her grandmother.
[02:54:31.363 --> 02:54:32.844]  It's like, this is the real world, people.
[02:54:32.844 --> 02:54:33.725]  This isn't a joke.
[02:54:34.065 --> 02:54:34.825]  Right.
[02:54:34.825 --> 02:54:37.346]  And that's what we're kind of losing.
[02:54:37.346 --> 02:54:46.589]  What we need to get back to is our compassion for each other and like empathy, real empathy where we can feel for people because everybody's going through something like everyone is.
[02:54:46.589 --> 02:54:48.990]  And I don't even think people mean
[02:54:49.952 --> 02:54:52.354]  To be bad when they're celebrating InfoWars?
[02:55:12.828 --> 02:55:17.356]  Celebrating the breakup of a family and just, you know, that's evil.
[02:55:17.356 --> 02:55:20.342]  Like that is, that is not where we need to be headed as human beings.
[02:55:20.342 --> 02:55:21.824]  How the hell do they produce so many evil people?
[02:55:23.925 --> 02:55:24.406]  I don't know.
[02:55:24.406 --> 02:55:30.292]  And I think it's, you know, obviously the more power you get, and that's something that... That summons the demons.
[02:55:30.292 --> 02:55:40.002]  The media has gotten a lot of power taken away from them in the last few years because a lot of people are waking up to the fact that it's just pure propaganda and whoever their owners are have an agenda.
[02:55:40.002 --> 02:55:40.502]  They don't get it.
[02:55:40.502 --> 02:55:41.763]  We don't want power.
[02:55:41.763 --> 02:55:43.926]  I want them off my back.
[02:55:44.426 --> 02:55:50.390]  Well, you never even monetized your videos or anything until a few, maybe a year or so ago.
[02:55:50.390 --> 02:55:59.216]  You wanted everything to be free, just everybody download it, upload it to your own website, I don't care, I'm not going to hit you with a trademark violation or anything.
[02:55:59.216 --> 02:56:01.477]  You just wanted the information to be out there.
[02:56:01.477 --> 02:56:08.322]  Anyone can use it, anyone can take it, and you know, I think that says a lot, you know, the difference between
[02:56:09.142 --> 02:56:21.493]  Other entities that are trying to hold on to their power by any means necessary to the point that they're making the case to alter our Constitution and redefine free speech.
[02:56:21.493 --> 02:56:26.257]  Well, they really came after you because you were powerful and you didn't leave because of that.
[02:56:26.917 --> 02:56:28.298]  Well, there are fake lawsuits against you.
[02:56:28.298 --> 02:56:33.681]  You left because your grandmother had a brain tumor, your mother got cancer, your dad died all in a year and a half.
[02:56:33.681 --> 02:56:36.843]  And just, you know, I didn't even know your dad had died until you just told me.
[02:56:36.843 --> 02:56:42.367]  I know you went through a lot and it's just, it's just, I know your mom's still fighting and it's just, we're praying for you and your family.
[02:56:42.367 --> 02:56:54.234]  Well, yeah, that's actually one of the reasons why I really wanted to come back to just say thank you to everyone out there in InfoWars that prayed for my mom, that donated to her GoFundMe campaign, and she wouldn't have been able to get
[02:56:54.554 --> 02:56:55.134]  Thank you.
[02:57:12.557 --> 02:57:16.278]  You know, are here illegally and can't afford to have surgery.
[02:57:16.278 --> 02:57:18.258]  And she told us that straight up.
[02:57:18.258 --> 02:57:21.579]  And that's why she was so upset that my mom couldn't get this surgery.
[02:57:21.579 --> 02:57:24.279]  Oh yeah, none of these illegal aliens, but they get everything free.
[02:57:24.279 --> 02:57:25.559]  Citizens don't.
[02:57:25.559 --> 02:57:25.839]  Right.
[02:57:25.839 --> 02:57:30.640]  And the lady was so upset about it that she really went out of her way to help my mom to make sure.
[02:57:30.640 --> 02:57:34.821]  And just everyone out there at InfoWars, I just can't even say thank you enough.
[02:57:34.821 --> 02:57:36.341]  My mom really appreciated it too.
[02:57:36.341 --> 02:57:37.842]  So she's on the upswing.
[02:57:39.462 --> 02:57:39.862]  That's good.
[02:57:39.862 --> 02:57:41.283]  We're going to come back with hour number four.
[02:57:41.283 --> 02:57:45.366]  Your phone call is straight ahead, then I'll address the censorship.
[02:57:45.366 --> 02:57:49.288]  Brain Force Plus is a top-tier nootropin.
[02:57:49.288 --> 02:57:50.489]  Focus.
[02:57:50.489 --> 02:57:51.470]  Clarity.
[02:57:51.470 --> 02:57:52.390]  Energy.
[02:57:52.390 --> 02:57:57.854]  But instead of having a seven times markup, we have a 150% markup.
[02:57:57.854 --> 02:58:00.036]  Right now, it's massively discounted.
[02:58:00.956 --> 02:58:07.302]  And when you get a bottle of it at 25% off, you get a free bottle of what is our total bestseller.
[02:58:07.302 --> 02:58:11.386]  It's not very profitable because we give it at such a low price, but it's amazing.
[02:58:11.386 --> 02:58:14.069]  And that, of course, is Knockout Ultimate Sleep Aid.
[02:58:14.069 --> 02:58:20.855]  So we've got a way to energize you, ramp you up in a healthy way during the day, and put you deep into that restful, healthy sleep at night.
[02:58:20.855 --> 02:58:23.958]  It's the Brain Force and Knockout Combo Deal.
[02:58:24.178 --> 02:58:29.602]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from InfoWars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[02:58:53.920 --> 02:58:57.702]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[02:58:57.702 --> 02:59:06.388]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[02:59:06.388 --> 02:59:10.991]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[02:59:10.991 --> 02:59:12.432]  You are the info war.
[02:59:12.432 --> 02:59:15.974]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:59:16.634 --> 02:59:17.435]  We are the renaissance.
[02:59:17.435 --> 02:59:18.095]  And we are winning.
[02:59:49.244 --> 03:00:00.907]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:00.907 --> 03:00:09.089]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[03:00:09.089 --> 03:00:13.370]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who is apparently
[03:00:20.175 --> 03:00:21.195]  Alex Jones!
[03:00:21.195 --> 03:00:23.776]  Scum!
[03:00:23.776 --> 03:00:25.796]  Russian scum!
[03:00:25.796 --> 03:00:34.018]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[03:00:34.018 --> 03:00:35.318]  InfoWars comes to mind.
[03:00:35.318 --> 03:00:37.139]  Your reputation's amazing.
[03:00:37.139 --> 03:00:38.599]  I will not let you down.
[03:00:38.599 --> 03:00:41.460]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[03:00:43.871 --> 03:01:02.470]  Alright, Leanne, you've got some amazing stuff you want to cover and a bunch of things I want to get to and I need to make a statement about other channels they left up of ours and the defamation that Facebook's engaged in saying that he's been banned, he's dangerous, and he's an anti-Semite.
[03:01:02.470 --> 03:01:07.675]  And I don't have the money to sue Facebook, I don't want to, but at a certain point, Leanne, how do you respond to stuff like this?
[03:01:08.598 --> 03:01:09.659]  You know, I don't know.
[03:01:09.659 --> 03:01:10.940]  You're asking the wrong person.
[03:01:10.940 --> 03:01:17.044]  You are such a warrior and a fighter and seem to be able to absorb these attacks.
[03:01:17.044 --> 03:01:25.250]  But it's hard out there in the real world trying to talk to people who are completely brainwashed and trying to convince them otherwise.
[03:01:25.250 --> 03:01:35.017]  And that's why I've just honestly just sort of shut down the argument and trying to push against people who are totally brainwashed.
[03:01:36.338 --> 03:01:50.041]  Coming coming at them from more of a loving understanding way and it it seems to They realize I'm not trying to fight and like bash this information into their brain There's got a judo move.
[03:01:50.041 --> 03:02:04.445]  Yeah, I realize my my friends They'll come back around a week or so later and they've softened their tough stance and they actually listen to what I had to say Because at the end of the day we are friends and we do respect each other and that's what we got to get back to
[03:02:04.485 --> 03:02:12.311]  Maybe you should do a podcast every week with us, where it's live or you have guests on, where it's like, kind of like Crowder does, Change My Mind, you have liberals on.
[03:02:13.151 --> 03:02:17.573]  Well, that's what I'd like to, I would love to focus on what's working.
[03:02:17.573 --> 03:02:19.914]  What do we, what, what can we agree on?
[03:02:19.914 --> 03:02:29.479]  Because every election cycle, you know, where it's just by design, they get us very polarized and they shine the camera on the super polarized, the alt-right, the alt-left.
[03:02:29.479 --> 03:02:30.980]  Sure, but how about real people?
[03:02:30.980 --> 03:02:31.420]  Right.
[03:02:31.420 --> 03:02:35.562]  And most people are, we have a lot more in common than we do.
[03:02:35.562 --> 03:02:37.003]  Well, here's an example.
[03:02:38.982 --> 03:02:44.687]  I mean, the media knows that I'm not anti-Israel, and if I want to be anti-Israel, that's my right.
[03:02:44.687 --> 03:02:54.876]  But they know that I'm one of the hottest figures for decades attacked on the internet by anti-Semites who are mainly leftist funded who want to control the narrative and want to make nationalism racist.
[03:02:55.456 --> 03:03:01.779]  So just the claim that I'm banned from Facebook for being anti-semitic, it's just outrageous BS.
[03:03:01.779 --> 03:03:03.380]  It's just insane.
[03:03:03.380 --> 03:03:07.142]  I don't hate anybody because they're Jewish or Iranian or Mexican.
[03:03:07.142 --> 03:03:08.642]  I like certain people.
[03:03:08.642 --> 03:03:09.543]  I like a lot of Jews.
[03:03:09.543 --> 03:03:10.783]  There's a bunch of Jews I dislike.
[03:03:10.783 --> 03:03:15.165]  And I shouldn't have to even explain that and I'm not going to play race cards here.
[03:03:15.165 --> 03:03:15.706]  It's just that...
[03:03:18.551 --> 03:03:25.857]  It's, it's, you know, I never even thought, oh, my ex-wife's part Jewish, so that means my kids could be called Jewish, and then anti-Semites talk about how they want to get my kids.
[03:03:25.857 --> 03:03:30.741]  My kids are just Americans, and they're patriots, and whatever they want to believe is what they're going to believe.
[03:03:30.741 --> 03:03:33.603]  And, you know, they've all self-identified as Christians.
[03:03:33.603 --> 03:03:42.430]  But, I mean, it's sick, it's sick, it's sick to have kids that are part Jewish and be called an anti-Semite when I've never said a damn thing against Jews.
[03:03:42.430 --> 03:03:44.192]  I mean, Zuckerberg and your managers?
[03:03:44.192 --> 03:03:44.832]  Screw you!
[03:03:46.033 --> 03:03:48.015]  Man, you're dicks, man.
[03:03:48.015 --> 03:03:49.376]  You're jerks, man.
[03:03:49.376 --> 03:03:50.236]  You're frauds.
[03:03:50.236 --> 03:03:51.157]  That's all I can say.
[03:03:51.157 --> 03:03:55.000]  Yeah, well, that's the same thing they're saying about the president, that he's anti-Semitic.
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:58.283]  Meanwhile, his daughter is, and her children, you know.
[03:03:58.283 --> 03:03:59.363]  How do they do this?
[03:04:01.525 --> 03:04:03.286]  Yeah, no, that's what I'm saying.
[03:04:03.286 --> 03:04:07.108]  It's like we're dealing with crazy clown world.
[03:04:07.108 --> 03:04:09.089]  It makes you crazy.
[03:04:09.089 --> 03:04:17.314]  And unfortunately, we're all sitting here trying to dispute what the crazies are saying instead of actually talking about what's real.
[03:04:17.314 --> 03:04:18.054]  You're a bunch of liars.
[03:04:18.054 --> 03:04:19.415]  We don't listen to a word you say.
[03:04:19.415 --> 03:04:20.275]  We're done with you.
[03:04:20.275 --> 03:04:21.076]  We don't even care.
[03:04:21.076 --> 03:04:21.896]  It's just fog of war.
[03:04:21.896 --> 03:04:22.957]  They know they've lost.
[03:04:22.957 --> 03:04:24.378]  So they just throw stuff up.
[03:04:24.378 --> 03:04:24.938]  It's like, you know.
[03:04:24.938 --> 03:04:25.198]  Right.
[03:04:25.198 --> 03:04:26.059]  And respond to this.
[03:04:26.059 --> 03:04:26.859]  Respond to that.
[03:04:26.859 --> 03:04:27.319]  Fight this.
[03:04:28.820 --> 03:04:33.403]  I had an NPR call me about three months ago and they go, we know you're in the KKK, you want to respond?
[03:04:33.403 --> 03:04:37.305]  And I said, that's not true, I've never even, I hate the, and they just, they just make stuff up!
[03:04:37.305 --> 03:04:41.048]  Just to see if you take the bait.
[03:04:41.048 --> 03:04:43.849]  Just throw on a fishing expedition as some journalists do.
[03:04:45.669 --> 03:04:47.429]  Let's run through some calls and I'll respond to this.
[03:04:47.429 --> 03:04:51.210]  I'm going to get into your whole Milky Way nebula breakdown.
[03:04:51.210 --> 03:04:52.570]  You don't want to miss this, folks.
[03:04:52.570 --> 03:04:54.191]  Leanne McAdoo.
[03:04:54.191 --> 03:04:56.331]  Infowarsstore.com is how you support us.
[03:04:56.331 --> 03:04:59.392]  And it's not like we're selling stuff you don't need, you don't want.
[03:04:59.392 --> 03:05:07.953]  The air in the average American home is filled with toxins that put it on par with a major city.
[03:05:07.953 --> 03:05:10.514]  Some of the most polluted areas on earth are major cities.
[03:05:10.934 --> 03:05:12.656]  How can I solve that problem?
[03:05:12.656 --> 03:05:26.368]  So we have air filters at InfowarsStore.com, the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off the Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking ion cluster air filter technology.
[03:05:26.368 --> 03:05:29.331]  And we've got a limited quantity of these left right now.
[03:05:29.331 --> 03:05:32.914]  We're basically selling these at cost because there was a big overhaul.
[03:05:33.194 --> 03:05:37.238]  Go ahead and read the hundreds of five-star reviews for yourself.
[03:05:37.238 --> 03:05:39.059]  I've got two in my home.
[03:05:39.059 --> 03:05:45.145]  You will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the Alexa Pure Breeze in your house.
[03:05:45.145 --> 03:05:49.789]  Don't live in a polluted major city in your home.
[03:05:49.789 --> 03:05:50.890]  Have clean air.
[03:05:50.890 --> 03:05:52.171]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[03:06:01.889 --> 03:06:09.790]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:09.790 --> 03:06:19.032]  The poets tell how Poncho fell, and left his living in a cheap hotel.
[03:06:19.032 --> 03:06:22.133]  The desert's quiet, Cleveland's cold.
[03:06:22.133 --> 03:06:26.093]  And so the story ends, we're told.
[03:06:26.093 --> 03:06:29.654]  Poncho needs your prayers, it's true.
[03:06:30.993 --> 03:06:34.916]  Let's save a few for Leigh-Anne too.
[03:06:34.916 --> 03:06:39.200]  She only did what she had to do.
[03:06:39.200 --> 03:06:42.963]  And now she's found the fountain of Europe.
[03:06:42.963 --> 03:06:46.586]  Alright, I swore I'd go to these calls, but I told them earlier I'd like to take 10 calls.
[03:06:46.586 --> 03:06:48.427]  Because the phone system can take like 20.
[03:06:48.427 --> 03:06:52.170]  And then I'm never going to get to my guests if other people are holding and then I feel guilty.
[03:06:52.170 --> 03:06:53.291]  But they're all there.
[03:06:53.291 --> 03:06:55.253]  Leigh-Anne, let's just address the censorship now.
[03:06:55.253 --> 03:06:57.735]  Because I said I'd do it at the start of the hour and then I'll go to calls.
[03:07:00.199 --> 03:07:03.383]  I don't know how you respond to just a PR hoax.
[03:07:03.383 --> 03:07:07.589]  People think they're reading a news article and it's, oh, Alex Jones banned off more Facebook.
[03:07:07.589 --> 03:07:09.651]  He's not supposed to be on the air.
[03:07:09.651 --> 03:07:12.555]  No, they made false charges 10 months ago.
[03:07:12.555 --> 03:07:17.442]  They took me off a bunch of platforms together as a cartel to make censorship about me instead of everybody else.
[03:07:18.563 --> 03:07:35.899]  And then now they say Louis Farrakhan, Milo Yiannopoulos, InfoWars for being dangerous, anti-Semitic, and give no examples and say they wouldn't give examples and didn't send us any messages why they took down my like private account, a couple old accounts, like Endgame the movie and TerrorStorm from over 10 years ago I'd forgotten about.
[03:07:35.899 --> 03:07:38.001]  Right.
[03:07:38.001 --> 03:07:40.203]  So what do you think this is?
[03:07:41.786 --> 03:07:48.013]  Well, obviously, they can't let you have a tremendous influence on the next election.
[03:07:48.013 --> 03:07:50.716]  This is like do or die time for them.
[03:07:50.716 --> 03:07:55.942]  At least if they're not going to win the presidency, at least they can get the houses of Congress.
[03:07:55.942 --> 03:07:56.843]  Sure, but why not?
[03:07:56.843 --> 03:07:57.244]  Why not?
[03:07:59.102 --> 03:08:01.643]  Why didn't they just ban it all 8, 9, 10 months ago?
[03:08:01.643 --> 03:08:07.185]  Why are they like doling it out and like finding endgame no traffic?
[03:08:07.185 --> 03:08:09.926]  Like, we banned him again, dammit!
[03:08:09.926 --> 03:08:15.188]  Which all it does is just make more people want to see what got banned.
[03:08:15.188 --> 03:08:17.129]  Well, I should look into this endgame.
[03:08:17.129 --> 03:08:18.609]  I should look into this Alex Jones.
[03:08:18.609 --> 03:08:20.990]  Why is he so dangerous, you know?
[03:08:20.990 --> 03:08:26.492]  Until they've got everyone socially programmed that if they even look at it like what happened in New Zealand, if they even
[03:08:26.952 --> 03:08:34.417]  If you look at the video, you show armored vehicles running people over, or Islamists just cutting heads off, but don't show what this guy did.
[03:08:34.417 --> 03:08:35.078]  Right.
[03:08:35.078 --> 03:08:37.299]  Yeah, that's totally fine, exactly.
[03:08:37.299 --> 03:08:38.500]  But that's it.
[03:08:38.500 --> 03:08:42.843]  It's just, there's social programming coming down the line.
[03:08:42.843 --> 03:08:45.845]  Paul Joseph Watson reported on this years ago.
[03:08:45.845 --> 03:08:54.230]  Everyone called him crazy and said, oh yeah, they think they're going to be changing the internet to match China's internet and internet control system.
[03:08:54.230 --> 03:08:55.671]  And that's exactly where we're headed.
[03:08:55.671 --> 03:08:56.612]  And when people say Kafka,
[03:08:57.132 --> 03:09:02.714]  It's where you get tried in a trial and never told what you did.
[03:09:02.714 --> 03:09:10.998]  So you read this, and it goes, Lewis Farrakhan, anti-Semite, blah, blah, blah, Alex Jones, dangerous, anti-Semite, and he's banned, and that's it, and CNN runs it all, blah, blah, blah.
[03:09:10.998 --> 03:09:12.658]  It doesn't say what I did.
[03:09:12.658 --> 03:09:13.419]  They don't tell us.
[03:09:13.419 --> 03:09:18.021]  They're just like, well, these five old accounts that some fan set up that you ran, they're all banned.
[03:09:19.301 --> 03:09:32.805]  Well, and that's the other reason why I kind of just wanted to step back because I don't want to give them the power or the pleasure to say, well, now we're going to take you off of your social media accounts and force you to stop being able to have incomes.
[03:09:32.805 --> 03:09:36.026]  But then, as you said earlier in the break, it's in the news.
[03:09:36.026 --> 03:09:38.286]  Even though you don't update your site, they keep it.
[03:09:38.286 --> 03:09:41.307]  Everyone communicating with you is still being grabbed and spied on.
[03:09:41.647 --> 03:09:42.648]  Right, exactly.
[03:09:42.648 --> 03:09:58.221]  And even if you delete Facebook or Instagram or other things from your phone or off your computer, if you ever clicked on a link that would take you to Facebook, they are tracking you and they're getting paid off of you.
[03:09:58.221 --> 03:10:00.743]  My wife has been trying to get off Facebook for two years.
[03:10:00.743 --> 03:10:02.725]  It won't let her delete the account.
[03:10:02.725 --> 03:10:04.866]  Yeah, it just keeps saying, hey, you sure you don't want to?
[03:10:04.866 --> 03:10:07.889]  And she keeps getting like photos from people like, oh, we're still here.
[03:10:07.889 --> 03:10:08.449]  Right.
[03:10:09.551 --> 03:10:10.912]  That's slavery, man.
[03:10:10.912 --> 03:10:13.395]  Where it's a company and you can't get off of it.
[03:10:13.857 --> 03:10:31.729]  Right, and they control all the flow of information and they've made it to where even businesses, even if businesses wanted to leave Facebook because they don't like what their business practice is, that they're only allowing them to reach 5% of their audience unless they pay them money, pay for this post to reach more of your audience.
[03:10:31.729 --> 03:10:41.355]  Businesses can't leave because the whole system duped everyone into getting sucked into... Let's be clear, 10-15 years ago, 12 years ago, to be technical, 10-15 years ago,
[03:10:43.075 --> 03:10:45.798]  The internet was 97% millions of websites.
[03:10:45.798 --> 03:10:48.021]  Everybody surfed the web on different communities.
[03:10:48.021 --> 03:10:50.844]  Now 90% are these big four tech companies.
[03:10:50.844 --> 03:10:53.647]  And now once they've got you, they use the monopoly.
[03:10:53.647 --> 03:10:55.369]  We learned we would pay Facebook to reach more.
[03:10:55.369 --> 03:10:56.090]  We even wouldn't.
[03:10:56.090 --> 03:10:57.852]  It was like they just had you.
[03:10:57.852 --> 03:10:59.634]  And so now this is the takeover.
[03:11:00.094 --> 03:11:17.442]  Right, well and also I read some articles about how YouTube was, even any channels that engage in quote-unquote conspiracy theories were going to be basically shadow banned and you wouldn't be able to find them and the only promoted videos you get are just nonsense.
[03:11:17.442 --> 03:11:19.123]  And then everybody that tries to promote it gets banned.
[03:11:19.123 --> 03:11:20.263]  So here it is right here.
[03:11:20.263 --> 03:11:23.725]  Facebook profits are down, so are Google profits though.
[03:11:23.725 --> 03:11:24.806]  This is hurting them.
[03:11:24.806 --> 03:11:26.246]  They're losing the war.
[03:11:26.246 --> 03:11:27.027]  They say in here that
[03:11:28.485 --> 03:11:33.888]  All Alex Jones information is considered dangerous and will be purged.
[03:11:33.888 --> 03:11:36.269]  Will be purged from its platform.
[03:11:36.269 --> 03:11:38.950]  So now they're going to the level of saying, you won't say his name.
[03:11:38.950 --> 03:11:42.611]  So now we've got to create something like Jack Frost or something.
[03:11:42.611 --> 03:11:44.192]  That's my code name.
[03:11:44.192 --> 03:11:45.073]  Seriously.
[03:11:45.073 --> 03:11:46.373]  I'll be no longer Alex Jones.
[03:11:46.373 --> 03:11:50.655]  I'll be Jack Frost or whatever, because this is what it's reached.
[03:11:50.655 --> 03:11:54.037]  I mean, and it'll take the big tech system, you know, months to figure that out.
[03:11:54.037 --> 03:11:55.717]  That's the level of control.
[03:11:55.717 --> 03:11:56.938]  Is this really what we want?
[03:11:57.725 --> 03:12:03.186]  Yeah, making people have to go back to putting up a flyer on, you know, taping it to the telephone pole.
[03:12:03.186 --> 03:12:04.786]  Oh, we're going to go with that, and you just sit on my head.
[03:12:04.786 --> 03:12:07.187]  We're about to hit the third dimension, Arden.
[03:12:07.187 --> 03:12:17.669]  Yeah, well it's, you know, it's just, I don't really know where we're headed, but I feel like if we could all just sort of step back and, again, tune back into our own inner power, our inner wisdom.
[03:12:17.669 --> 03:12:23.710]  We are so much more powerful than these tech giants, but they've just convinced us that we need them to survive new business.
[03:12:23.710 --> 03:12:27.331]  That's it, they convinced us that the whole universe is them and the internet.
[03:12:27.731 --> 03:12:30.092]  And these little digital things where we communicate.
[03:12:30.092 --> 03:12:33.533]  It's us that's powerful, but they get us to go on their platform, so now they've got us.
[03:12:33.533 --> 03:12:35.514]  And they're like, oh, you think you're so powerful?
[03:12:35.514 --> 03:12:37.435]  Well, we're going to shut down your account.
[03:12:37.435 --> 03:12:39.516]  Why do you think, obviously, I'm the target of this.
[03:12:39.516 --> 03:12:41.157]  Yiannopoulos is kind of retired.
[03:12:41.157 --> 03:12:42.917]  Farrakhan's got his own thing going on.
[03:12:42.917 --> 03:12:46.999]  They just mixed me into the middle of this because Trump's winning.
[03:12:46.999 --> 03:12:49.380]  They're about to indict a bunch of Democrats.
[03:12:49.380 --> 03:12:53.642]  And Facebook's getting targeted by the establishment for not doing enough.
[03:12:53.642 --> 03:12:54.702]  So this is their little token.
[03:12:54.702 --> 03:12:56.363]  Oh, look, I banned Alex Jones.
[03:12:56.943 --> 03:12:57.324]  Right.
[03:12:57.324 --> 03:13:03.610]  And meanwhile, there's a lot of stories about the anti-Semitism within the Democratic Party.
[03:13:03.610 --> 03:13:10.317]  But then that just gets... If you call that out, then you're being Islamophobic or whatever term they use.
[03:13:10.317 --> 03:13:12.740]  It's like Ilhan Omar says, blow Israel up.
[03:13:12.740 --> 03:13:15.503]  By the way, she has the right to... They've hypnotized the world.
[03:13:15.503 --> 03:13:16.544]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:13:16.544 --> 03:13:17.705]  But it's okay for her.
[03:13:17.705 --> 03:13:19.306]  And then I'm banned.
[03:13:20.157 --> 03:13:21.197]  Right.
[03:13:21.197 --> 03:13:22.217]  That's exactly it.
[03:13:22.217 --> 03:13:28.959]  You look at Ilhan Omar, the chip on her shoulder, the level of dark energy and hate when she's up on a podium, and it's really crazy.
[03:13:28.959 --> 03:13:37.101]  Well, it's just people who don't appreciate this country and being in this country and being taken in.
[03:13:37.101 --> 03:13:37.981]  She says she hates it.
[03:13:37.981 --> 03:13:39.161]  She says it sucks.
[03:13:39.161 --> 03:13:44.562]  I want to go back to a country where they'll cut off my head if I speak against the government.
[03:13:44.562 --> 03:13:46.883]  Women are slaves in Somalia.
[03:13:46.883 --> 03:13:47.143]  Yeah.
[03:13:48.300 --> 03:13:52.181]  It's just... And then she gets here and she says, you will take Islam.
[03:13:52.181 --> 03:13:53.942]  America suck!
[03:13:53.942 --> 03:13:57.343]  I mean, I can play the white people bad.
[03:13:57.343 --> 03:13:57.723]  Yeah.
[03:13:57.723 --> 03:14:07.006]  And it's like, you know, I can understand a lot of the different arguments that a lot of different groups want to make about the evil white man or whatever.
[03:14:07.006 --> 03:14:09.147]  But history is ugly.
[03:14:09.147 --> 03:14:16.529]  You know, a lot of a lot of flowers had to... Why is everybody trying to get into the white devil countries if they're so bad?
[03:14:18.916 --> 03:14:19.696]  I don't know.
[03:14:19.696 --> 03:14:21.117]  That's a good question.
[03:14:21.117 --> 03:14:32.623]  If you ask them that question, you know, why are people risking their lives to come from Cuba on a floaty made out of plastic bottles if it's so great there in their communist country?
[03:14:32.623 --> 03:14:38.165]  Like, it's just, they don't have an answer for that because they've bought into the self-hate.
[03:14:38.165 --> 03:14:39.506]  It's like Ilhan Omar.
[03:14:41.174 --> 03:14:47.677]  And Linda Saucer came out and said women shouldn't take their head jibs off in Iran.
[03:14:47.677 --> 03:14:51.278]  Like real feminists, real women saying, I'm not a slave, I'll drive a car.
[03:14:51.278 --> 03:14:53.119]  She's like, no, no, put back on!
[03:14:53.119 --> 03:14:55.800]  And feminists are like, damn right, women!
[03:14:55.800 --> 03:14:59.442]  You know, women don't get to walk around and drive their own car.
[03:14:59.442 --> 03:14:59.802]  Damn it!
[03:15:00.993 --> 03:15:20.949]  Well, you know, just driving across the country these last couple weeks, seeing how much wide open space there is, and there's still a lot of this country that looks pretty good to some other country wanting to come in and take out the big bad America.
[03:15:20.949 --> 03:15:22.511]  They would love to see this country fall.
[03:15:22.511 --> 03:15:25.573]  And we're such pleasers and such bend over the barrel.
[03:15:25.573 --> 03:15:26.013]  Exactly.
[03:15:26.013 --> 03:15:27.495]  It's like a big flashing sign.
[03:15:29.039 --> 03:15:29.559]  Screw us.
[03:15:29.559 --> 03:15:29.999]  Screw us.
[03:15:29.999 --> 03:15:30.620]  Take us over.
[03:15:30.620 --> 03:15:31.340]  Usurp us.
[03:15:31.340 --> 03:15:32.981]  And Trump comes in and says, no, we're not going to do that.
[03:15:32.981 --> 03:15:35.702]  And we're like, oh my god, you're the biggest, worst thing on earth.
[03:15:35.702 --> 03:15:37.863]  You're not going to put up with us railing you?
[03:15:37.863 --> 03:15:39.683]  We'll be back, I promise, with your phone calls.
[03:15:39.683 --> 03:15:42.945]  And Leanne's got our Milky Way story coming up.
[03:15:42.945 --> 03:15:44.485]  Leanne McAdoo in studio.

[03:16:53.061 --> 03:16:54.282]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:54.282 --> 03:16:58.204]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.204 --> 03:16:59.745]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:59.745 --> 03:17:02.706]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:02.706 --> 03:17:08.269]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.

[03:17:42.871 --> 03:17:43.432]  HBExtract.com.
[03:17:43.432 --> 03:17:45.914]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[03:17:54.315 --> 03:17:57.777]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:17:57.777 --> 03:18:01.538]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:18:01.538 --> 03:18:07.821]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:18:07.821 --> 03:18:10.603]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:18:11.343 --> 03:18:15.147]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:18:15.147 --> 03:18:21.634]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:18:21.634 --> 03:18:26.599]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:27.338 --> 03:18:31.261]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:18:31.261 --> 03:18:38.467]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:18:38.467 --> 03:18:43.692]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:18:43.692 --> 03:18:49.376]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:49.376 --> 03:18:53.340]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.

[03:19:57.282 --> 03:20:06.190]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:06.190 --> 03:20:12.176]  When I was summoned from Montgomery, I had my guitar on my back.
[03:20:12.176 --> 03:20:16.780]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[03:20:16.780 --> 03:20:21.765]  He was dressed like 1950 and drunk and hollow-eyed.
[03:20:23.661 --> 03:20:27.223]  Would you like to ride, son?
[03:20:27.223 --> 03:20:29.884]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:29.884 --> 03:20:35.027]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:20:39.736 --> 03:20:42.557]  Alright, let's get right back to Leon McAdoo and the phone calls.
[03:20:42.557 --> 03:20:51.319]  I just said on air, if any of you drudges listening, link to it on InfoWars, and just like, you fire the bat signal up into the sky over Gotham, and Batman shows up.
[03:21:03.539 --> 03:21:09.401]  Which is good, because it's like them giving you a cigarette when they lead your ass up to the gallows.
[03:21:09.401 --> 03:21:12.582]  Man, they are on our ass, the things they're doing.
[03:21:12.582 --> 03:21:16.904]  And I don't feel bad, actually, because I know Trump is 100 times worse.
[03:21:16.904 --> 03:21:18.905]  Other folks, it's really bad.
[03:21:18.905 --> 03:21:22.226]  And Leanne, you're not a victim either, but you got harassed really bad.
[03:21:22.226 --> 03:21:23.787]  They had PIs on you.
[03:21:23.787 --> 03:21:28.188]  They were convinced we were together, which never happened.
[03:21:28.188 --> 03:21:32.590]  We're not victims here, but just people need to know, this has been a dirty, hard war for a while.
[03:21:32.870 --> 03:21:33.390]  Mm-hmm.
[03:21:33.390 --> 03:21:33.850]  Right.
[03:21:33.850 --> 03:21:36.571]  I mean, that was another reason I had to get out of Austin.
[03:21:36.571 --> 03:21:37.972]  I didn't feel safe here.
[03:21:37.972 --> 03:21:44.554]  You know, I just, it's, we talk about being in these big cities when, you know, the stuff hits the fan.
[03:21:44.554 --> 03:21:46.355]  And you're seeing it.
[03:21:46.355 --> 03:21:47.535]  It's percolating.
[03:21:47.535 --> 03:21:48.495]  It's percolating out there.
[03:21:48.495 --> 03:21:52.157]  And if they label you the enemy or, you know, you're a racist.
[03:21:52.157 --> 03:21:53.557]  Well, they say you're a Nazi, man.
[03:21:53.557 --> 03:21:54.457]  These people believe it.
[03:21:54.457 --> 03:21:54.817]  Right.
[03:21:54.817 --> 03:21:56.478]  They think Adolf Hitler's walking down the street.
[03:21:57.198 --> 03:22:01.221]  And they believe they're doing right because they are fighting Nazis.
[03:22:01.221 --> 03:22:09.206]  So it's like this weird warped reality where you can't even say... And now they have CBS TV shows where they go, I'm gonna beat up Nazis and it's Trump supporters.
[03:22:09.206 --> 03:22:10.647]  Is it time to beat up Nazis?
[03:22:11.363 --> 03:22:14.086]  And it's like, we're not Nazis, you crazy maniacs!
[03:22:14.086 --> 03:22:15.948]  Right, or who was that?
[03:22:15.948 --> 03:22:18.791]  Cuomo was, like, praising Antifa.
[03:22:18.791 --> 03:22:19.171]  You know?
[03:22:19.171 --> 03:22:19.872]  Just two days ago.
[03:22:19.872 --> 03:22:22.315]  Saying how it's a, you know, it's a good cause.
[03:22:22.315 --> 03:22:26.599]  And not even realizing that they are... That's dangerous!
[03:22:26.599 --> 03:22:28.101]  I mean, why is he still on the air?
[03:22:28.101 --> 03:22:29.222]  That is dangerous rhetoric.
[03:22:29.222 --> 03:22:32.606]  You are talking up these groups that are actually getting physically violent.
[03:22:33.226 --> 03:22:34.627]  And raging on their cities.
[03:22:34.627 --> 03:22:35.788]  And we got callers who want to get into this.
[03:22:35.788 --> 03:22:36.489]  I don't want you to get into this.
[03:22:36.489 --> 03:22:46.416]  But since DrugsReport.com has linked us, biggest news site in the world, second biggest site, period, CNN's Oliver Darcy, I got banned for two reasons on Twitter.
[03:22:46.416 --> 03:22:49.559]  They said beating up a 10-year-old kid, $1 million reward if you show it to me.
[03:22:49.559 --> 03:22:50.059]  It wasn't me.
[03:22:50.059 --> 03:22:51.740]  It was an ABC News clip.
[03:22:51.740 --> 03:22:53.301]  And, quote, harassing a reporter.
[03:22:53.301 --> 03:22:54.162]  He's there at the hearings.
[03:22:54.162 --> 03:22:56.204]  I go, how dare you call for me to be banned?
[03:22:56.204 --> 03:22:57.645]  You modern book burner.
[03:22:57.645 --> 03:22:58.785]  You're like a Nazi.
[03:22:58.785 --> 03:23:00.127]  The left always calls us Nazis.
[03:23:00.127 --> 03:23:01.327]  He wants speech banned.
[03:23:02.348 --> 03:23:07.332]  So now this rat is the person running the story that Drudge is linked to.
[03:23:07.332 --> 03:23:12.477]  Facebook bans Louis Farrakhan, Milo Yiannopoulos, Infowars, and others for its platforms.
[03:23:12.477 --> 03:23:13.578]  And notice how they did it.
[03:23:13.578 --> 03:23:18.242]  Milo Yiannopoulos is a gay Jewish person who's basically been destroyed.
[03:23:18.242 --> 03:23:22.005]  You've got Louis Farrakhan with his own issues and then Infowars.
[03:23:22.005 --> 03:23:29.851]  But they mix it and they say anti-Semitism and hate and dangerousness, not fake news, not dangerousness, will be purged
[03:23:30.752 --> 03:23:31.672]  From the platform.
[03:23:31.672 --> 03:23:34.233]  So they say Alex Jones will be purged.
[03:23:34.233 --> 03:23:34.814]  Purged!
[03:23:34.814 --> 03:23:37.075]  I'm being purged!
[03:23:37.075 --> 03:23:39.376]  Yeah.
[03:23:39.376 --> 03:23:40.876]  So what do you, can we zoom in more on this?
[03:23:40.876 --> 03:23:47.279]  I want to show folks, or pull up the actual article on Drudge and blow that up for TV viewers, because I'm being purged!
[03:23:47.279 --> 03:23:54.422]  Well, and then you have the whole Democratic Party, like, rallying around some of their, the new, the newbies in
[03:23:55.422 --> 03:24:01.343]  That have been elected, that, no, they're not anti-semitic, they just have a different way of using the language.
[03:24:01.343 --> 03:24:19.807]  It's okay for them to say these things about Jewish people, and, you know, that they've hypnotized the world, and, so it's just like... That's what's upside down is, I say that Ilhan Omar has a right to say the stuff she says, I don't agree with it, or Louis Farrakhan, but then they say we're doing it, when you go to any of the Nazi sites, they hate us!
[03:24:19.807 --> 03:24:22.368]  You go to any Nazi site, man, I'm like right up there with Netanyahu.
[03:24:22.708 --> 03:24:24.430]  Oh yeah, they hate me too.
[03:24:24.430 --> 03:24:27.232]  I mean, it's like... Yeah, they say you're Jewish, you're gonna get it.
[03:24:27.232 --> 03:24:37.221]  Well, yeah, I'm supposedly a secret Jew, you know, my ex-boyfriend is black, you know, and actually, FYI, he was black and Mexican, so that should make you really mad.
[03:24:37.221 --> 03:24:40.624]  That's what I'm saying is they're accusing us of the opposite.
[03:24:40.624 --> 03:24:41.385]  Yeah.
[03:24:41.385 --> 03:24:44.188]  So, like, we're banned for being anti-Semitic, but then we're not.
[03:24:45.302 --> 03:24:55.768]  Yeah, no, but it's like, you're bad, but these other people that they need on the Democratic Party, like the governor of Virginia who is in his KKK robe or blackface, we still haven't gotten to the bottom of which one.
[03:24:55.768 --> 03:24:57.369]  But they may be comfortable.
[03:24:57.369 --> 03:25:01.712]  There's no reporters out there figuring out which person he was in that photo.
[03:25:01.712 --> 03:25:04.594]  Like, it's just completely gone out of the news cycle.
[03:25:04.594 --> 03:25:08.336]  You know, we never figured out who was in that photo, but that's fine.
[03:25:08.336 --> 03:25:11.038]  You know, it's just, it's the double standard is, is.
[03:25:11.038 --> 03:25:11.858]  But you read this.
[03:25:11.858 --> 03:25:13.279]  It's so frustrating.
[03:25:14.560 --> 03:25:19.769]  Jones is purged for his violence and dangerousness and anti-semitism.
[03:25:19.769 --> 03:25:23.495]  And the average person who's watching this must think this is true.
[03:25:23.495 --> 03:25:26.439]  Because again, they didn't just ban me, they just defamed us, Leigh-Anne.
[03:25:27.284 --> 03:25:28.865]  Right.
[03:25:28.865 --> 03:25:32.527]  But that doesn't, I mean... Why did Zuckerberg even do this?
[03:25:32.527 --> 03:25:37.749]  Well, it's interesting, like, you put out the bat signal, and Matt Drudge is, you know, there.
[03:25:37.749 --> 03:25:42.131]  But Oliver Darcy puts out the bat signal, and it's jack at Twitter.
[03:25:42.131 --> 03:25:47.394]  And it's like, tyrannical, shut down anyone who may hurt my feelings, kind of a thing.
[03:25:47.714 --> 03:25:55.279]  It's like CNN and these other places are in cahoots with these tech giants saying, how can we shut down these conservatives?
[03:25:55.279 --> 03:25:56.940]  There was another story I just saw up on Drudge.
[03:25:56.940 --> 03:26:00.703]  They're trying to brand it as un-news, if you're conservative.
[03:26:00.703 --> 03:26:01.343]  Oh, that's right here.
[03:26:01.343 --> 03:26:02.684]  I actually have it.
[03:26:02.684 --> 03:26:06.407]  Facebook hit us this morning with a strike and shut down one of the accounts.
[03:26:06.407 --> 03:26:07.707]  We know this is over it.
[03:26:07.707 --> 03:26:12.050]  Exclusive, the measles outbreak is a giant false flag and a hoax.
[03:26:12.050 --> 03:26:16.273]  You watch the video and go, no, measles is real, but they're blaming unvaccinated when it's really illegal aliens.
[03:26:16.273 --> 03:26:17.074]  And then I showed
[03:26:18.192 --> 03:26:21.155]  ABC News, CDC and Current Reports.
[03:26:21.155 --> 03:26:26.700]  Everything we know about the measles outbreak, patient zero, and it says it was an illegal alien from a foreign country.
[03:26:26.700 --> 03:26:28.102]  That's ABC News.
[03:26:28.102 --> 03:26:33.246]  And then I showed Border Patrol, releasing thousands who are exposed to diseases like tuberculosis.
[03:26:33.246 --> 03:26:38.311]  And so I showed Swedish doctors, says deadly parasite disease has doubled since refugee wave.
[03:26:38.311 --> 03:26:41.574]  Most people are sick from Syria and Afghanistan.
[03:26:41.574 --> 03:26:43.056]  We're talking bubonic plague, we're talking...
[03:26:43.882 --> 03:26:45.482]  It's leprosy, Leanne!
[03:26:45.482 --> 03:26:46.203]  Right.
[03:26:46.203 --> 03:26:56.746]  So, this is what we showed in our article, but as you said, Journalism Institute ties blacklist 29 conservative outlets as un-news.
[03:26:56.746 --> 03:26:59.146]  So here's the thing.
[03:26:59.146 --> 03:27:04.548]  Once you don't defend InfoWars, first they demonize InfoWars, then once people buy that, then they target everybody.
[03:27:04.548 --> 03:27:05.228]  This is it.
[03:27:05.228 --> 03:27:05.848]  Right.
[03:27:05.848 --> 03:27:06.228]  Exactly.
[03:27:06.228 --> 03:27:08.769]  And that's exactly what happened, and it's happened so quickly.
[03:27:09.543 --> 03:27:11.427]  So what do you think the President should do?
[03:27:11.427 --> 03:27:18.661]  To me this is racketeering, these are cartels, it violates Section 230, then they go to Congress and they have these hearings and they deny it's happening?
[03:27:19.625 --> 03:27:37.277]  Right, I mean, to actually have Zuckerberg and others get up there in front of Congress and lie and say they're not shadowbanning people, even though they're on camera, on hidden cameras, talking about how they, oh yeah, we shadowban people, we just decide certain words.
[03:27:37.277 --> 03:27:38.798]  Project Veritas, yeah, all of it.
[03:27:38.798 --> 03:27:46.263]  Yeah, and then we see how much the media has demonized Project Veritas and O'Keefe in saying how they manipulate the footage.
[03:27:46.263 --> 03:27:49.345]  He just won a libel case proving he didn't edit stuff deceptively.
[03:27:49.585 --> 03:27:50.026]  Exactly.
[03:27:50.026 --> 03:27:51.848]  That guy puts hour-long videos out.
[03:27:51.848 --> 03:27:52.188]  Right.
[03:27:52.188 --> 03:28:00.057]  And who was the... Was it Katie Couric who did that one anti-gun thing where she totally deceptively edited the video?
[03:28:00.057 --> 03:28:02.780]  She would edit a totally different question in with something else.
[03:28:02.780 --> 03:28:03.101]  Right.
[03:28:03.101 --> 03:28:03.741]  Just like Megyn Kelly.
[03:28:03.741 --> 03:28:05.143]  Megyn Kelly did to you as well.
[03:28:05.143 --> 03:28:05.664]  I mean, that's...
[03:28:06.164 --> 03:28:08.106]  That's why you can't sit with these people, folks.
[03:28:08.106 --> 03:28:10.168]  I mean, I'm telling you, you think you know liars?
[03:28:10.168 --> 03:28:11.389]  No, you don't know liars.
[03:28:11.389 --> 03:28:12.009]  Right, you have to.
[03:28:12.009 --> 03:28:13.250]  So you've experienced them.
[03:28:13.250 --> 03:28:13.731]  You have to.
[03:28:13.731 --> 03:28:15.132]  They'll go, don't you decry racism?
[03:28:15.132 --> 03:28:16.053]  You'll go, absolutely.
[03:28:16.053 --> 03:28:18.275]  And they'll cut to you going, well, I actually defend it.
[03:28:18.275 --> 03:28:19.316]  It's from the Second Amendment.
[03:28:19.316 --> 03:28:20.037]  Right.
[03:28:20.037 --> 03:28:28.104]  Well, you can show them Bill Clinton praising Robert Byrd and saying, oh, you know, that he was just, that's what he had to do at the time.
[03:28:28.104 --> 03:28:29.125]  Grand Dragon.
[03:28:29.125 --> 03:28:31.087]  Yeah, he was the, no, the Grand Cyclops.
[03:28:32.145 --> 03:28:33.226]  He was the Grand Slag Club.
[03:28:33.226 --> 03:28:34.408]  Cyclopsians, lizards, dragons.
[03:28:34.408 --> 03:28:36.630]  I don't even know.
[03:28:36.630 --> 03:28:37.351]  I don't know.
[03:28:37.351 --> 03:28:38.292]  I said I'd take calls.
[03:28:38.292 --> 03:28:39.073]  A lot of folks hung up.
[03:28:39.073 --> 03:28:39.794]  That's fine.
[03:28:39.794 --> 03:28:41.176]  Liberty Smith and Bob, you're coming up.
[03:28:41.176 --> 03:28:46.282]  We'll continue to talk about this with Leanne McAdoo and we'll get into some of their other topics coming up.
[03:28:46.282 --> 03:28:51.949]  But yeah, there's a new world now, man, where they're banning everybody and then they tell Congress nobody's getting banned.
[03:28:53.211 --> 03:28:55.434]  Okay, so a watch is good, and some jewelry.
[03:28:55.434 --> 03:28:56.735]  Better grab some flowers, too.
[03:28:56.735 --> 03:28:57.716]  Hey, whatcha doin'?

[03:29:03.463 --> 03:29:05.185]  Uh, you know there's an easier way, right?

[03:31:54.360 --> 03:32:07.788]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube censorship, and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored, the most buried, the most oppressed.
[03:32:07.788 --> 03:32:18.815]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night, all the arrogant leftist authoritarians, like the Young Turks and others, get so butthurt when Trump won.
[03:32:20.129 --> 03:32:22.050]  They don't want us to have that victory.
[03:32:22.050 --> 03:32:26.072]  They don't want us to remember what political action did.
[03:32:26.072 --> 03:32:30.434]  And that's why the globalists, Hillary and others, are trying to shut InfoWars down.
[03:32:30.434 --> 03:32:34.697]  This is a fight about taking your speech away, not just my speech.
[03:32:34.697 --> 03:32:36.958]  About taking your very sovereignty away.
[03:32:36.958 --> 03:32:38.359]  This country is in a war!
[03:32:39.275 --> 03:32:49.983]  So again, I want to thank you for what you've done, but I want to remind you, if you don't spread the articles and videos, and if you don't financially get the great products we have and fund us, and the 360 win, we're dead in the water.
[03:32:49.983 --> 03:32:50.804]  I'm in your hands.
[03:32:50.804 --> 03:32:51.824]  You're in my hands.
[03:32:51.824 --> 03:32:53.225]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:32:53.225 --> 03:32:57.208]  Thank you.
[03:32:57.208 --> 03:32:59.910]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.572 --> 03:33:46.597]  So, DrudgeReport.com, the number one news site in the world, is linked to our response right now, and all I can say is, Leanne, we had more than 40 Facebook pages that fans created over a decade ago, and they gave them to us.
[03:33:46.597 --> 03:33:49.138]  I wasn't even smart enough to set one up.
[03:33:49.138 --> 03:33:50.118]  And they've gotten rid of, like,
[03:33:51.420 --> 03:33:53.082]  Almost all of them.
[03:33:53.082 --> 03:33:58.307]  It was a personal Alex Jones page we barely used, and some old pages from movies we put out.
[03:33:58.307 --> 03:34:03.373]  So now they ban those for being dangerous, along with Louis Farrakhan and Milo Yiannopoulos.
[03:34:03.373 --> 03:34:07.898]  They don't say why we're banned, just that we're these evil anti-Semites or whatever.
[03:34:07.898 --> 03:34:10.360]  And you had some points to make about that, because obviously
[03:34:12.032 --> 03:34:17.215]  Thank God we have our own radio stations, our own platforms at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[03:34:17.215 --> 03:34:20.817]  We have our own video and audio feeds for folks to go look at and share, hopefully.
[03:34:20.817 --> 03:34:31.684]  But the arrogance of big tech to tell Congress they're not doing this and now do this now, I think this is in response to the Mueller report falling flat, the fact that they've been caught illegally spying.
[03:34:31.684 --> 03:34:33.105]  I think this is a temper tantrum.
[03:34:33.590 --> 03:34:39.858]  Right, well, CNN has lost like 28% of their viewership now since the Mueller reports come out.
[03:34:39.858 --> 03:34:43.223]  People are just like, you know what, I'm done with the lies.
[03:34:43.223 --> 03:34:45.626]  Well, they already lost 90%, so yeah.
[03:34:45.626 --> 03:34:48.670]  Their average show has like maybe 50,000 viewers.
[03:34:49.491 --> 03:34:51.872]  Yeah, that's why they're mad.
[03:34:51.872 --> 03:34:52.893]  That's why they're angry.
[03:34:52.893 --> 03:34:55.254]  And they're thinking, well, we've tried to shut him down.
[03:34:55.254 --> 03:34:56.675]  We've took him off this platform.
[03:34:56.675 --> 03:34:59.257]  Why is he still reaching so many people?
[03:34:59.257 --> 03:35:04.260]  It's just like they're, you know, every little step that they can take to completely silence you.
[03:35:05.743 --> 03:35:10.947]  It's funny because at first no one really spoke out about it, but it's happening to so many other people now.
[03:35:10.947 --> 03:35:17.912]  That now even like conservatives, they're even tempering what they say and like watching their speech.
[03:35:17.912 --> 03:35:20.273]  Yeah, groveling to these thought police.
[03:35:20.273 --> 03:35:29.500]  I mean, I even this week, for strategic reasons we didn't want to say what happened, but they went after and tried to take down our biggest servers and just take the URL down.
[03:35:29.500 --> 03:35:32.001]  I mean, we're at URL point.
[03:35:32.001 --> 03:35:34.063]  So people need to know, I mean, this is a real war, folks.
[03:35:34.443 --> 03:35:35.144]  Right.
[03:35:35.144 --> 03:35:37.706]  Well, and that's why I just wanted to step back and say, you know what?
[03:35:37.706 --> 03:35:39.447]  I'm not playing your game.
[03:35:39.447 --> 03:35:41.009]  You're not in control of me.
[03:35:41.009 --> 03:35:47.394]  I don't want to buy into this new system, this new society and system that you're trying to set up and control us all.
[03:35:47.394 --> 03:35:48.195]  I just want out.
[03:35:48.195 --> 03:35:49.436]  You're right.
[03:35:49.436 --> 03:35:51.999]  They're making their move saying, hey, you need us.
[03:35:51.999 --> 03:35:53.840]  We gave them a monopoly, now they're abusing it.
[03:35:53.840 --> 03:35:54.621]  Wow, what a surprise.
[03:35:54.881 --> 03:35:55.622]  Right.
[03:35:55.622 --> 03:35:59.606]  And then earlier you were talking about the measles story.
[03:35:59.606 --> 03:36:12.959]  We were talking about how they take the anger, genuine anger, genuine confusion, genuine concern a parent might have for their child, and they direct your anger and energy toward their preferred target.
[03:36:15.481 --> 03:36:23.103]  They want everyone to, they're stirring up all this controversy and anger so that people are mad at parents who will not vaccinate their children.
[03:36:23.103 --> 03:36:31.726]  Meanwhile, they will not talk about the fact that these patient zeroes are coming here illegally, coming from places where they haven't eradicated disease.
[03:36:31.726 --> 03:36:32.887]  And by the way, that's ABC News, not CBC.
[03:36:32.887 --> 03:36:34.487]  They're not the enemy.
[03:36:34.487 --> 03:36:34.887]  Yeah.
[03:36:34.887 --> 03:36:38.668]  And then when we link, we do a video and link to this, Facebook bans it and says it's fake.
[03:36:38.668 --> 03:36:38.909]  Right.
[03:36:38.909 --> 03:36:40.269]  Well, and that's false news.
[03:36:40.549 --> 03:36:45.591]  Right, and that's the same thing they're doing here with banning you from all these platforms, calling you dangerous.
[03:36:45.591 --> 03:36:54.253]  They're taking away the fact that they're protecting anti-Semitic people in their own party, or actual racists in their own party.
[03:36:54.253 --> 03:36:57.274]  They're diverting our attention away from that story.
[03:36:57.274 --> 03:37:02.576]  It goes out of the news very quickly, and then they just want to pull everyone's attention back to their preferred target.
[03:37:02.876 --> 03:37:08.303]  Parents aren't allowed to go on Facebook or YouTube and make comments, hey my kid got hurt by vaccines.
[03:37:08.303 --> 03:37:10.566]  Or you could talk about a hamburger place having a roach leg in it.
[03:37:10.566 --> 03:37:12.768]  Or you could talk about a chiropractor who did a good job.
[03:37:12.768 --> 03:37:14.731]  Or you could talk about another place that had good food.
[03:37:14.731 --> 03:37:18.696]  They're saying no, you aren't allowed to criticize the medical system and tell us what happened.
[03:37:19.056 --> 03:37:19.797]  Right.
[03:37:19.797 --> 03:37:28.344]  I mean, what other country do they have vaccines and, like, big pharma for profit, like, vaccinating kids en masse?
[03:37:28.344 --> 03:37:29.165]  Like, they don't.
[03:37:29.165 --> 03:37:29.926]  Japan's banned it.
[03:37:29.926 --> 03:37:31.287]  It'll cause so much brain damage.
[03:37:31.287 --> 03:37:31.547]  Right.
[03:37:31.547 --> 03:37:35.610]  It's, it's, they don't have pharmaceutical companies, ads,
[03:37:36.471 --> 03:37:39.532]  After the news, like paying for their news programs.
[03:37:39.532 --> 03:37:41.912]  Oh, well, we're going to cut to this commercial from Big Pharma.
[03:37:41.912 --> 03:37:43.833]  They don't have that in other countries.
[03:37:43.833 --> 03:37:47.354]  They don't have pharmaceutical ads on their television.
[03:37:47.354 --> 03:37:48.654]  It's not a thing there.
[03:37:48.654 --> 03:37:54.335]  So we are really being targeted and enslaved by Big Pharma to where they don't want any of this.
[03:37:54.335 --> 03:37:57.496]  They don't want people to ask about the vaccine injury court.
[03:37:57.936 --> 03:37:58.837]  Exactly.
[03:37:58.837 --> 03:38:01.320]  You had your dad die a year ago.
[03:38:01.320 --> 03:38:02.321]  Your mom almost died.
[03:38:02.321 --> 03:38:02.961]  Grandma, all that.
[03:38:02.961 --> 03:38:03.442]  You went through a lot.
[03:38:03.442 --> 03:38:06.985]  You took off, not just from work, but a whole year of just getting focused.
[03:38:06.985 --> 03:38:11.330]  You do seem to be really in that clairvoyant state.
[03:38:11.330 --> 03:38:12.771]  What do you think is coming in the future?
[03:38:12.771 --> 03:38:13.832]  What do you think Trump needs to do?
[03:38:13.832 --> 03:38:14.653]  What do we need to do?
[03:38:14.653 --> 03:38:16.435]  What is this current battle around?
[03:38:16.435 --> 03:38:19.999]  What would you call this space and time that humanity's in right now, Leigh-Anne?
[03:38:20.779 --> 03:38:34.396]  Well, I feel like people, it's almost like our energy is being pulled out from us, and pulled in all these different directions so that we can't focus, and it's forcing us to focus on crazy stuff that's not even real, stuff that doesn't matter.
[03:38:34.396 --> 03:38:39.482]  I actually, the reason why I sent Daria the picture of the Milky Way galaxy... Let's put it up.
[03:38:40.043 --> 03:38:40.363]  I don't know.
[03:39:00.302 --> 03:39:03.764]  Could see this every day and really put it in perspective where we are?
[03:39:03.764 --> 03:39:05.725]  I remember when I was a child, even in East Texas you could see it.
[03:39:05.725 --> 03:39:10.888]  Now you can't because all the chemtrails, the pollution, and what's in the jet stream.
[03:39:10.888 --> 03:39:16.011]  But if you still go out, like to Utah, or like you said, even West Texas, it's incredible.
[03:39:16.371 --> 03:39:30.066]  It's amazing, and if we were able to, like back in the day, you know, people were able to see the sky like that, it would really put how small we are in perspective, and how the little trivial stories that they're forcing us to be really angry about.
[03:39:31.708 --> 03:39:35.450]  Are making us focus on them and make them gods instead of just looking at the larger universe.
[03:39:35.450 --> 03:39:38.252]  And by the way, I remember being in Monument Valley, Utah.
[03:39:38.252 --> 03:39:47.717]  I was like 10 years old and staying up almost all night drinking coffee with my dad because you could see satellites going and you could also see like craft, whatever they were.
[03:39:47.717 --> 03:39:48.297]  Right.
[03:39:48.297 --> 03:39:50.818]  And it's like, whoa, this is like incredible.
[03:39:50.818 --> 03:39:51.438]  No, this is.
[03:39:51.438 --> 03:39:54.060]  You have to transcend realizing Hillary Clinton's not in charge.
[03:39:54.540 --> 03:39:55.320]  Exactly.
[03:39:55.320 --> 03:40:05.265]  And that's what they want us to just all be convinced and everyone's wasting all of their energy arguing about these really inconsequential things and just back and forth.
[03:40:05.265 --> 03:40:08.107]  Trump, is he a double agent, a triple agent?
[03:40:08.107 --> 03:40:10.288]  Oh no, I thought he was a complete idiot and a buffoon.
[03:40:10.288 --> 03:40:11.369]  Well, what is it?
[03:40:11.369 --> 03:40:17.232]  Like it's, you know, there's, it doesn't matter really, but we're using so much of our energy.
[03:40:17.232 --> 03:40:19.653]  We as human beings were so incredibly powerful.
[03:40:20.353 --> 03:40:21.034]  Exactly.
[03:40:21.034 --> 03:40:23.738]  They don't want us to actually tap into it.
[03:40:23.738 --> 03:40:24.879]  I think about it all the time.
[03:40:24.879 --> 03:40:29.025]  How do people look at the big picture and not cover the minutiae of the system?
[03:40:29.025 --> 03:40:30.507]  And that's really the catch-22 though.
[03:40:30.507 --> 03:40:31.708]  You're right, Leanne.
[03:40:31.708 --> 03:40:32.950]  What a great message you brought to us.
[03:40:36.471 --> 03:40:42.034]  On a daily basis on YouTube, all these sites are just like, Hitler's good, Alex Jones is bad.
[03:40:42.034 --> 03:40:46.836]  They're all, you see Google promotes them because of great division.
[03:40:46.836 --> 03:40:49.017]  And then I'm not for the Nazis.
[03:40:49.017 --> 03:40:50.738]  I'm not for the Israel.
[03:40:50.738 --> 03:40:53.919]  I'm just trying to be, you know, I don't want to kiss their ass.
[03:40:53.919 --> 03:40:55.360]  I mean, it's sick.
[03:40:55.360 --> 03:40:59.262]  They just won't stop, though, because they want you to be in their little group.
[03:40:59.722 --> 03:40:59.982]  Right.
[03:40:59.982 --> 03:41:08.191]  Well, and you can look at the double standard in the governor of Virginia who was there in blackface or the KKK hood.
[03:41:08.191 --> 03:41:14.497]  We don't know which one he was because no one seemed to think that that was important to get to the bottom of that.
[03:41:14.497 --> 03:41:17.780]  But then they said, oh, you know, that was a long time ago.
[03:41:17.780 --> 03:41:21.444]  I mean, granted, he put it on his, you know, yearbook page.
[03:41:21.444 --> 03:41:22.585]  The point is that there's a double standard.
[03:41:22.585 --> 03:41:26.648]  But Brett Kavanaugh, what he allegedly did, that was so important.
[03:41:26.648 --> 03:41:27.188]  Do you know what I mean?
[03:41:27.188 --> 03:41:28.769]  There's like a total double standard.
[03:41:28.769 --> 03:41:30.590]  It's in people's faces.
[03:41:30.590 --> 03:41:38.115]  And I think it's time for people on the left, I think they're even seeing this double standard to where we're beginning to understand that we're being lied to.
[03:41:38.115 --> 03:41:39.376]  We're being led by the nose.
[03:41:39.376 --> 03:41:42.158]  Our real genuine feelings are being manipulated.
[03:41:42.158 --> 03:41:42.698]  It's simple.
[03:41:42.698 --> 03:41:45.780]  I mean, the globalists had thought they had America under its control.
[03:41:45.780 --> 03:41:46.841]  And now that's not happening.
[03:41:46.841 --> 03:41:48.702]  So they're freaking out.
[03:41:48.702 --> 03:41:51.965]  I want to come back to a few calls on censorship and what's happening.
[03:41:51.965 --> 03:41:52.425]  But Leanne,
[03:41:54.365 --> 03:41:57.746]  Again, Dredger's link to us right now, people are asking why this is happening.
[03:41:57.746 --> 03:42:05.108]  You read these articles, you've got them right there, it says we're purging Alex Jones, and they don't even give a reason why except talking about anti-Semitism.
[03:42:05.108 --> 03:42:13.549]  Right, and they know people because people have already quote-unquote evolved to the point where they don't even read the articles, they just read the headlines.
[03:42:13.549 --> 03:42:18.090]  They read the headlines and they read the 150 characters that might be in a Facebook post.
[03:42:18.090 --> 03:42:20.011]  But don't the authoritarians get the model?
[03:42:20.811 --> 03:42:25.074]  When you say, don't listen to this person, they're dangerous, all you do is shun people there.
[03:42:25.074 --> 03:42:29.598]  But notice, nothing against Farrakhan, nothing against Yiannopoulos, Malinopoulos.
[03:42:29.598 --> 03:42:32.380]  Yiannopoulos, I think is off the radar screen.
[03:42:32.380 --> 03:42:34.802]  Farrakhan is a big follower, but he's not really doing much.
[03:42:34.802 --> 03:42:37.464]  It's all about just mixing me in now with this.
[03:42:38.729 --> 03:42:42.596]  Well, why didn't they mix Obama in with Farrakhan?
[03:42:42.596 --> 03:42:43.096]  You know what I mean?
[03:42:43.096 --> 03:42:45.881]  Like, why all of a sudden he's dangerous now?
[03:42:45.881 --> 03:42:47.584]  No, it's just all a fraud.
[03:42:47.584 --> 03:42:48.966]  They're test marketing.
[03:42:48.966 --> 03:42:50.770]  Lee Ann Mackett is our guest in studio.
[03:42:50.770 --> 03:42:52.452]  The next level of internet censorship is here.

[03:47:14.327 --> 03:47:21.093]  Well, the War Room with Ellen Schreuer is coming up here in about 10 minutes at Infowars.com forward slash show.
[03:47:21.093 --> 03:47:27.638]  And remember, you've been told we're not on the air, even though we're on over 200 radio stations, over 100 cable and TV stations.
[03:47:27.638 --> 03:47:29.900]  Baytree News says we're off the air, we're deplatformed.
[03:47:31.909 --> 03:47:42.203]  But there were some Facebook accounts that, quite frankly, we weren't really even paying attention to, that Facebook's done a big stunt to prove the leftists and the EU and the CHICOMS and Hillary, they're good globalists.
[03:47:42.203 --> 03:47:46.388]  They banned us, along with Louis Faircon and Milo Yiannopoulos, for being dangerous.
[03:47:47.029 --> 03:47:47.549]  Anti-Semitic.
[03:47:47.549 --> 03:47:48.010]  And guess what?
[03:47:48.010 --> 03:47:55.355]  Oliver Darcy that runs the censorship, the platforming system, he's the one announcing it as usual.
[03:47:55.355 --> 03:47:56.476]  I mean, my God.
[03:47:56.476 --> 03:47:59.298]  And then they tell Congress, oh, we're not censoring anybody.
[03:47:59.298 --> 03:48:02.340]  But they even admit here, oh, we just say it's dangerous, they're banned.
[03:48:02.340 --> 03:48:04.601]  So we, I mean, Trump needs to take action.
[03:48:04.601 --> 03:48:08.384]  And if he does take any kind of action, he's going to be accused of being a dictator.
[03:48:08.384 --> 03:48:09.105]  Well, so what?
[03:48:09.105 --> 03:48:10.826]  A totalitarian authoritarian.
[03:48:10.826 --> 03:48:13.788]  Meanwhile, it's actually the tech giants that are playing that role.
[03:48:13.788 --> 03:48:15.269]  And we're just buying right into it.
[03:48:15.549 --> 03:48:26.341]  Well Leanne, you're leaving tomorrow, and I wish you were staying here longer, but taking care of family and stuff, and your mom's surgery coming up, so we're praying for her, but I hope you'll go on the war room later if you can, but just other points you want to make to the folks out there.
[03:48:26.341 --> 03:48:31.706]  Well you were talking about Endgame, and even the Endgame was one of the Facebook channels that got shut down.
[03:48:32.427 --> 03:48:50.326]  And I remember, like, ten plus years ago, I didn't even know who you were, and my roommate and I watched Endgame, and it was just filled with so much information, and then that last five minutes, it's like, by the way, everyone's doing this because soon they're going to be uploading their brains to machines and, like, living forever, kind of, I forget the whole, you know.
[03:48:50.326 --> 03:48:53.990]  And they've been promised, the digital gods, that they must kill you first, which is their own statement.
[03:48:54.070 --> 03:48:54.430]  Right.
[03:48:54.430 --> 03:48:58.455]  And so even then I was like, whoa, that went left.
[03:48:58.455 --> 03:48:59.776]  What's happening?
[03:48:59.776 --> 03:49:05.222]  Because you're coming up with all this factual information, then taking it to the future that just seems so unbelievable.
[03:49:05.222 --> 03:49:08.505]  But now we're actually seeing that future come around.
[03:49:08.505 --> 03:49:12.189]  And that, for me, that shows me that
[03:49:13.030 --> 03:49:15.112]  We as humans were created in God's image.
[03:49:15.112 --> 03:49:25.442]  We do not need this technology to be able to heal ourselves, communicate with each other, but they've convinced us that we need to get these microchips to be super powerful.
[03:49:25.442 --> 03:49:26.563]  It's the parasite.
[03:49:26.563 --> 03:49:30.146]  Yes, we need to upload to machines, we need to connect with this technology.
[03:49:30.146 --> 03:49:33.790]  It's the only way we're going to advance as a society.
[03:49:33.790 --> 03:49:34.611]  And that's it.
[03:49:36.132 --> 03:49:39.573]  And again, it's not the technology itself that's bad, it's the Trojan horse commanders.
[03:49:39.573 --> 03:49:40.874]  They are running it.
[03:49:40.874 --> 03:49:46.576]  They've given us these things that we designed, and then they convince us that it's God.
[03:49:46.576 --> 03:49:47.256]  Exactly.
[03:49:47.256 --> 03:49:48.496]  And they're playing God.
[03:49:48.496 --> 03:50:00.840]  And they want everyone to get in line, to be socially programmed, so that when they are all connected to these machines, and, oh, I better not do something bad, because then my social credit scores will go down, and I won't be able to leave the country.
[03:50:00.840 --> 03:50:01.781]  I hadn't read this.
[03:50:01.781 --> 03:50:03.081]  We need to get Paul on immediately.
[03:50:03.081 --> 03:50:04.842]  Paul Joseph Watson was banned.
[03:50:05.422 --> 03:50:06.743]  He was the real target of this.
[03:50:06.743 --> 03:50:08.004]  He was slaying it.
[03:50:08.004 --> 03:50:08.785]  Oh, yeah.
[03:50:08.785 --> 03:50:13.088]  I told him, I said, Paul, wait till you get a million followers on Twitter.
[03:50:13.088 --> 03:50:16.892]  I guarantee you, as soon as you hit one million followers, they're going to take you down.
[03:50:16.892 --> 03:50:22.837]  Just to prove a point, just to be like, because Paul will probably be like, yeah, I hit a million followers and they're going to take him down.
[03:50:22.837 --> 03:50:24.758]  Well, that's why I encourage him to start his own site.
[03:50:24.758 --> 03:50:26.560]  He has summit.news.
[03:50:26.560 --> 03:50:29.622]  And, you know, to get everybody over there to say, hey, we'll be banned soon.
[03:50:29.622 --> 03:50:30.363]  You better come over here.
[03:50:32.304 --> 03:50:36.906]  This is systematic, and let me tell you, they're going to pull some big stuff before the election.
[03:50:36.906 --> 03:50:38.747]  False flags, you name it.
[03:50:38.747 --> 03:50:41.968]  But listen, listeners, you can start a Facebook, YouTube, whatever.
[03:50:41.968 --> 03:50:48.090]  You can start one about gardening, but when it comes time, you're there when the big event happens, you cover it and tell the truth, you'll get them.
[03:50:48.090 --> 03:50:48.871]  You won't be stopped.
[03:50:48.871 --> 03:50:49.791]  You're the answer.
[03:50:49.791 --> 03:50:50.571]  You take action.
[03:50:50.571 --> 03:50:51.272]  You get out.
[03:50:51.272 --> 03:50:52.012]  You report.
[03:50:52.012 --> 03:50:56.834]  Start your own website, your own system, then use these bigger systems to promote your own website, like Matt Drudge said.
[03:50:56.834 --> 03:50:57.574]  That's the answer.
[03:50:57.574 --> 03:50:58.755]  Yep, that's genius.
[03:50:59.835 --> 03:51:02.079]  That is genius, and that's exactly what we need to do.
[03:51:02.079 --> 03:51:02.519]  Yeah.
[03:51:02.519 --> 03:51:04.262]  And I just had Daria talk about here, what?
[03:51:04.262 --> 03:51:05.564]  Paul Joseph.
[03:51:05.564 --> 03:51:06.305]  Yeah.
[03:51:06.305 --> 03:51:11.514]  Yeah, he was already going to be co-hosting the fourth hour, but I want him front and center, start of the show tomorrow.
[03:51:11.514 --> 03:51:11.974]  Okay, thank you.
[03:51:13.035 --> 03:51:16.418]  Yeah, it'd be interesting to see what he thinks about it.
[03:51:16.418 --> 03:51:21.742]  But notice they use Louis Farrakhan, because they've, you know, demonized, used so much quotes that I don't agree with.
[03:51:21.742 --> 03:51:25.465]  And then it's like, and Yiannopoulos, and Watson, and everybody, you know.
[03:51:25.465 --> 03:51:30.188]  But it's like they're only demonizing him to take you out, but they're not... You see how it works?
[03:51:30.188 --> 03:51:36.213]  He's totally fine when he's Linda Sarsour's friend and Obama's having private dinners with him, and I mean, it's like...
[03:51:36.653 --> 03:51:40.934]  They just pick and choose where to direct people's anger.
[03:51:40.934 --> 03:51:51.557]  And that's what people need to understand, that we're all being played, if you allow yourself to be emotionally manipulated, to take a step back and be calm, be rational.
[03:51:51.557 --> 03:51:58.359]  They want us all to be frazzled and insane, so that we can't come from our sovereignty and our inner wisdom.
[03:51:58.359 --> 03:52:00.000]  And that's where we need to get back.
[03:52:00.000 --> 03:52:03.721]  You're talking about the sacred place that Psalms talks about, I forget the exact psalm,
[03:52:04.801 --> 03:52:06.062]  The Quiet Place the Most High.
[03:52:06.062 --> 03:52:17.613]  You guys look up Psalms, The Quiet Place the Most High, because there is that place where you get in that, and you're like totally calm, you see everything, you know, you're in God's plan, and whatever happens, and you're so powerful in that position.
[03:52:18.567 --> 03:52:20.249]  We need to get in that position every day.
[03:52:20.249 --> 03:52:24.833]  Every day, if you can, and get out in nature, because that's where you're going to absolutely connect with God.
[03:52:24.833 --> 03:52:27.396]  All the studies show it, and the enemy wants to keep us out of nature.
[03:52:27.396 --> 03:52:39.067]  They want you plugged into technology, and then we see how depressed people are, teen suicide rates are up, because of the fact that we're not interacting with each other, our communities.
[03:52:39.087 --> 03:52:44.608]  I remember being a kid in woodshop in like sixth grade and carving this fish with a clock I put in to give my grandmother.
[03:52:44.608 --> 03:52:45.188]  She just died.
[03:52:45.188 --> 03:52:46.528]  I got it back in the house.
[03:52:46.528 --> 03:52:48.689]  And I remember like gardening and how it would get high.
[03:52:48.689 --> 03:52:56.690]  When I was like five years old, my grandfather like planting strawberries and picking things and like picking apples up in a tree.
[03:52:56.690 --> 03:52:58.050]  I would be hallucinating.
[03:52:58.050 --> 03:52:59.111]  I was so happy.
[03:52:59.111 --> 03:53:01.311]  And I still go and do it now and the same thing happens.
[03:53:01.311 --> 03:53:01.711]  Yep.
[03:53:01.711 --> 03:53:05.752]  I mean, I'm going to be honest, like literally picking apples or plowing a field is better than sex, man.
[03:53:05.752 --> 03:53:06.612]  It gets you in the flow.
[03:53:07.369 --> 03:53:24.626]  You hear the bees, everything goes like zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
[03:53:30.572 --> 03:53:32.494]  You know, that God energy.
[03:53:32.494 --> 03:53:34.396]  Because that's what we are.
[03:53:34.396 --> 03:53:35.176]  No, I agree.
[03:53:35.176 --> 03:53:35.797]  You're absolutely right.
[03:53:35.797 --> 03:53:40.081]  And Leanne, you look great when you quit a few years ago to take care of your mom and your dad and everything else.
[03:53:40.081 --> 03:53:40.662]  God, I'm sorry.
[03:53:40.662 --> 03:53:42.083]  But you're re-energized.
[03:53:42.083 --> 03:53:43.004]  I'm really impressed.
[03:53:43.004 --> 03:53:43.304]  Yeah.
[03:53:43.304 --> 03:53:45.967]  Well, I'm not just saying this because it sounds good.
[03:53:45.967 --> 03:53:48.509]  I'm speaking from experience.
[03:53:48.509 --> 03:53:53.434]  Unplug, get out in nature, reconnect with that inner wisdom that we all have.
[03:53:53.993 --> 03:53:55.054]  What would the internet do?
[03:53:55.054 --> 03:53:56.976]  Because I've been thinking about this for 10 years.
[03:53:56.976 --> 03:53:58.958]  I was thinking it when Trump won until he really messed with me.
[03:53:58.958 --> 03:53:59.458]  I didn't even get it.
[03:53:59.458 --> 03:54:00.599]  I was about to do the same thing.
[03:54:01.718 --> 03:54:05.120]  To literally just spend time with my kids, garden, get a ranch or something.
[03:54:05.120 --> 03:54:06.081]  I have a ranch in East Texas.
[03:54:06.081 --> 03:54:07.661]  We get a ranch here just because that's what I get.
[03:54:07.661 --> 03:54:18.528]  I get high like fixing fence or riding a horse or pulling, you know, turnips out of the ground or skinning a deer.
[03:54:18.528 --> 03:54:20.009]  It's just like all my ancestors did it.
[03:54:20.009 --> 03:54:21.469]  Like I'm supposed to do this.
[03:54:21.469 --> 03:54:24.331]  And I like literally like I get it's kind of worldly.
[03:54:24.331 --> 03:54:26.632]  Like I want to go back and do that.
[03:54:26.632 --> 03:54:28.513]  And then I didn't do it because I'm so tied to this fight.
[03:54:28.513 --> 03:54:30.935]  But imagine what the Internet would do if I like just walked off.
[03:54:31.255 --> 03:54:31.815]  Mm-hmm.
[03:54:31.815 --> 03:54:32.376]  Exactly.
[03:54:32.376 --> 03:54:34.677]  And then they'd be like, oh, we finally defeated him.
[03:54:34.677 --> 03:54:35.357]  Ha ha ha ha.
[03:54:35.357 --> 03:54:41.060]  But meanwhile, you're actually just healing yourself, restrengthening yourself for the big fight.
[03:54:41.060 --> 03:54:42.640]  Because that's what we're in right now.
[03:54:42.640 --> 03:54:42.920]  I agree.
[03:54:42.920 --> 03:54:44.921]  We've got to have this infrastructure to fight.
[03:54:46.562 --> 03:54:47.904]  So is the crew ready to get laid off?
[03:54:47.904 --> 03:54:49.205]  Ready for me to go?
[03:54:49.205 --> 03:54:50.086]  How about this close?
[03:54:50.086 --> 03:55:00.557]  Well, I feel like you've built up the operation enough that you have really great people on this team that would be able to allow you the time to recharge and become the ultimate warrior.
[03:55:00.557 --> 03:55:06.123]  Disappearing for about a year or two would like really be the move.
[03:55:06.123 --> 03:55:07.945]  Just believe me, I want it to, my God.
[03:55:08.902 --> 03:55:10.703]  Can you even imagine Alex Jones?
[03:55:10.703 --> 03:55:15.564]  I don't want to give the Clintons and the Chicoms my attention and study them.
[03:55:15.564 --> 03:55:19.025]  It is like the gods get forgotten about, they die.
[03:55:19.025 --> 03:55:20.926]  I don't want to look at them anymore.
[03:55:20.926 --> 03:55:33.791]  Well, they're hoping that you use all of your energy to focus on how evil they are and you get so angry and frustrated because then you're not using your true energy, your purpose, your mission, your anointing.
[03:55:33.791 --> 03:55:34.691]  You're not using it.
[03:55:35.151 --> 03:55:35.792]  For what it is.
[03:55:35.792 --> 03:55:40.035]  Because you're distracted with looking at the enemy and focusing on everything they're doing.
[03:55:40.035 --> 03:55:42.757]  Versus just being able to, like, speak your truth.
[03:55:42.757 --> 03:55:44.599]  Leanne, don't tempt me.
[03:55:44.599 --> 03:55:47.121]  You're really tempting me right now.
[03:55:47.121 --> 03:55:47.701]  I'm just saying.
[03:55:47.701 --> 03:55:48.842]  I have dreams about this.
[03:55:48.842 --> 03:55:52.105]  I don't want to... I have dreams, like, where I'm, like, just picking corn.
[03:55:52.645 --> 03:55:52.765]  Yeah.
[03:56:09.701 --> 03:56:11.262]  Well, I agree with the average parent out there.
[03:56:11.262 --> 03:56:13.704]  You need to take your children, move the country, and flee now.
[03:56:13.704 --> 03:56:15.545]  Money, power, none of it means anything.
[03:56:15.545 --> 03:56:16.286]  It means nothing.
[03:56:16.286 --> 03:56:17.487]  It's crap.
[03:56:17.487 --> 03:56:18.307]  It means nothing.
[03:56:18.307 --> 03:56:19.388]  It's just a trap.
[03:56:19.388 --> 03:56:20.689]  It's keeping you enslaved.
[03:56:20.689 --> 03:56:24.692]  Well, notice Obama, before he left, said, we need to stop people fleeing to the rural areas.
[03:56:24.692 --> 03:56:25.613]  They called it racist.
[03:56:25.613 --> 03:56:26.894]  Everybody's fleeing.
[03:56:26.894 --> 03:56:28.315]  You need to flee out of these cities.
[03:56:28.769 --> 03:56:31.170]  Right, because it's all about control.
[03:56:31.170 --> 03:56:41.132]  And once we break free from these control systems that are set up and realize our real true power, because that's what I think we're getting to, I believe... Oh, they know it.
[03:56:41.132 --> 03:56:41.832]  We're breaking free.
[03:56:41.832 --> 03:56:42.933]  We're going to win.
[03:56:42.933 --> 03:56:49.895]  We're going to figure out how powerful we are, that we don't need this technology to tap into the power that we have.
[03:56:49.895 --> 03:56:51.135]  And we are evolving.
[03:56:51.135 --> 03:56:55.156]  I don't know what's happening, whatever frequency they're sending... Are the enemies scared of what's about to happen?
[03:56:55.536 --> 03:57:02.064]  Yes, and they want us convinced that the only way that we can actually be our true genius selves is by getting a mindset.
[03:57:02.064 --> 03:57:06.430]  Well, if you look at Tim Cook or Zuckerberg, they're all slaves.
[03:57:06.430 --> 03:57:08.312]  They just radiate fallen nature.
[03:57:09.127 --> 03:57:11.588]  And then their minions, Hillary and people, are even more pathetic.
[03:57:11.588 --> 03:57:15.790]  It's like, it's like we're up on some power trip with God Almighty.
[03:57:15.790 --> 03:57:17.451]  I mean, look at those eyes.
[03:57:17.451 --> 03:57:18.552]  It's like just dead.
[03:57:18.552 --> 03:57:19.833]  It's like a robot.
[03:57:19.833 --> 03:57:22.574]  Yeah, this is the big spiritual battle that we're all talking about.
[03:57:22.574 --> 03:57:26.316]  So that's why it is so important that our spirits are most important.
[03:57:26.556 --> 03:57:27.577]  Leanne, good to see you.
[03:57:27.577 --> 03:57:29.700]  It's like a cool drink of water in the desert.
[03:57:29.700 --> 03:57:31.201]  Great job to the crew.
[03:57:31.201 --> 03:57:32.623]  Owen Shroyer, War Room, coming up.
[03:57:32.623 --> 03:57:34.465]  InfoWars.com, Ford's last show.
[03:57:34.465 --> 03:57:36.187]  Thank you, DrugsReport.com.
[03:57:36.187 --> 03:57:37.369]  We fired the bat signal.
[03:57:37.369 --> 03:57:39.551]  How magic is that you linked up to this?
[03:57:39.551 --> 03:57:40.873]  And we know we're over the target.
[03:57:40.873 --> 03:57:43.516]  We're being censored and banned.
[03:57:43.516 --> 03:57:45.878]  Stacey in the great state of Texas.
[03:57:46.872 --> 03:57:49.954]  In FEMA Region 6, you're on the air worldwide, Stacey.
[03:58:02.643 --> 03:58:08.629]  You know, because I've seen a lot of other vitamins that don't have things that they say that they have in them, and they're often not things that are natural.
[03:58:08.629 --> 03:58:09.389]  I appreciate that.
[03:58:09.389 --> 03:58:11.011]  Well, what happened with Ultimate Female Force?
[03:58:11.011 --> 03:58:11.611]  Tell us about it.
[03:58:11.611 --> 03:58:12.392]  Well, it's really great.
[03:58:12.392 --> 03:58:13.673]  You know, it's like a multivitamin.
[03:58:13.673 --> 03:58:14.194]  I take it.
[03:58:14.194 --> 03:58:14.934]  It tastes good.
[03:58:14.934 --> 03:58:16.796]  It doesn't have that nasty aftertaste.
[03:58:16.796 --> 03:58:18.738]  It actually has kind of a pleasant aftertaste.
[03:58:18.738 --> 03:58:22.201]  And, you know, it just gives me energy and fuels me throughout the day, so I really like it.
[03:58:22.261 --> 03:58:25.064]  Well, just so you know, we look at whatever the best herbs are.
[03:58:25.064 --> 03:58:26.825]  They're known to turbocharge women.
[03:58:26.825 --> 03:58:28.907]  And then we get the organic ones and put it in it.
[03:58:28.907 --> 03:58:29.828]  So, yeah.
[03:58:29.828 --> 03:58:32.271]  Stamina, libido, energy.
[03:58:32.271 --> 03:58:35.093]  These are amazing things and ultimate female force.
[03:58:35.093 --> 03:58:36.255]  So, I'm glad you plugged it.
[03:58:36.255 --> 03:58:38.076]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:58:45.031 --> 03:58:46.452]  I want to say brain force is great.
[03:58:46.452 --> 03:58:48.353]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[03:58:48.353 --> 03:58:48.973]  It is.
[03:58:48.973 --> 03:58:53.836]  But if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[03:58:53.836 --> 03:58:55.017]  The fish oil is better than it.
[03:58:55.017 --> 03:58:56.938]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:58:56.938 --> 03:58:59.499]  Fish oil is liquid energy.
[03:58:59.499 --> 03:59:01.120]  Brain, body, heart.
[03:59:01.120 --> 03:59:02.581]  The cleanest, the best out there.
[03:59:02.581 --> 03:59:03.961]  You've got the children's.
[03:59:03.961 --> 03:59:05.082]  You've got the adults.
[03:59:05.082 --> 03:59:06.083]  You've got the krill oil.
[03:59:06.083 --> 03:59:08.524]  If you're going to get the full effect, the fish oil and the children's
[03:59:08.544 --> 03:59:10.525]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:59:35.282 --> 03:59:41.305]  So, we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[03:59:41.305 --> 03:59:47.749]  I just can't do it!
[03:59:47.749 --> 03:59:50.331]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
